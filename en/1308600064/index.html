    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are going to discuss salt,</p>
<p>also referred to as sodium.</p>
<p>Now, most of us think of salt</p>
<p>as something that we put on and in our food,</p>
<p>maybe something to avoid.</p>
<p>Maybe some of you are actually trying to get more salt.</p>
<p>Some of you are trying to get less salt.</p>
<p>We all seem to associate salt</p>
<p>with things like blood pressure, et cetera.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to go down a different set of avenues</p>
<p>related to salt.</p>
<p>We will certainly cover how salt regulates blood pressure.</p>
<p>We are also going to talk about</p>
<p>how the brain regulates our appetite for salt</p>
<p>or our aversion for salt.</p>
<p>We are also going to talk about</p>
<p>how our sensing of salty tastes</p>
<p>actually mediates how much sugar we crave</p>
<p>and whether or not we ingest more or less sugar</p>
<p>than we actually need.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re going to learn today</p>
<p>is that the so-called salt system,</p>
<p>meaning the cells and connections in our brain and body</p>
<p>that mediate salt craving and avoidance</p>
<p>are regulating many, many aspects of our health</p>
<p>and our ability to perform in various contexts,</p>
<p>things like athletic performance,</p>
<p>things like cognitive performance.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also going to talk about aging and dementia</p>
<p>and avoiding aging and dementia</p>
<p>and what role salt and salt avoidance might play in that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to touch on some themes</p>
<p>that for some of you might seem controversial</p>
<p>and indeed, if they are controversial,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be sure to highlight them as such.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to cover a lot of new data</p>
<p>that point to the possibility,</p>
<p>I want to emphasize the possibility that for some people,</p>
<p>more salt might help them in terms of health,</p>
<p>cognitive and bodily functioning.</p>
<p>And for other people, less salt is going to be better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to talk about what the various parameters are.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to give you some guidelines</p>
<p>that in concert with your physician,</p>
<p>who you should absolutely talk to</p>
<p>before adding or changing anything</p>
<p>to your diet or supplementation regime,</p>
<p>can help you arrive at a salt intake</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to optimize your mental,</p>
<p>physical health and performance.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to cover neurobiology,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to cover hormone biology,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to talk about liver function,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to talk about kidney function</p>
<p>and of course, brain function.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to share this information with you today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certain you&rsquo;re going to come away with it</p>
<p>a lot of information and actionable items.</p>
<p>Before we dive into the topic of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>I want to highlight a really exciting new study.</p>
<p>This is a study from Diego Bohorta&rsquo;s lab</p>
<p>at Duke University.</p>
<p>The Bohorta&rsquo;s lab studies interactions</p>
<p>between the gut and the brain</p>
<p>and has made some incredible discoveries</p>
<p>of the so-called neuropod cells.</p>
<p>Neuropod cells are neurons, nerve cells</p>
<p>that reside in our gut and that detect things</p>
<p>like fatty acids, amino acids</p>
<p>and some neuropod cells sense sugar.</p>
<p>Previous work from this laboratory</p>
<p>has shown that when we ingest sugar,</p>
<p>these neuropod cells respond to that sugar</p>
<p>and send electrical signals up a little wire</p>
<p>that we call an axon through the vagus nerve,</p>
<p>for those of you that want to know and into the brain</p>
<p>and through subsequent stations of neural processing</p>
<p>evoke the release of dopamine.</p>
<p>Dopamine is a molecule known to promote craving</p>
<p>and motivation and indeed action.</p>
<p>And what these neuropod cells that send sugar</p>
<p>are thought to do is to promote seeking</p>
<p>and consumption eating of more sugary foods.</p>
<p>Now, the incredible thing is that it&rsquo;s all subconscious.</p>
<p>This is a taste system in the gut</p>
<p>that is not available to your conscious awareness.</p>
<p>Now, of course, when you ingest sweet foods,</p>
<p>you taste them on your mouth too.</p>
<p>And so part of the reason that you crave sweet foods</p>
<p>perhaps is because they taste good to you.</p>
<p>And the other reason is that these neuropod cells</p>
<p>are driving a chemical craving</p>
<p>below your conscious detection.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re really two systems.</p>
<p>Your gut is sensing at a subconscious level what&rsquo;s in it</p>
<p>and sending signals to your brain that work in concert</p>
<p>in parallel with the signals coming from your mouth</p>
<p>and your experience of the taste of the food.</p>
<p>Now, that alone is incredible.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been the subject of many important landmark papers</p>
<p>over the last decade or so.</p>
<p>You can imagine how the system would be very important</p>
<p>for things like hidden sugars</p>
<p>when nowadays in a lot of processed foods,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re putting hidden sugars.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re putting a lot of things that cause your gut</p>
<p>to send signals to your brain</p>
<p>that make you crave more of those foods.</p>
<p>So for those of you that really love sugar,</p>
<p>just understand it&rsquo;s not just about how that sugar tastes.</p>
<p>The new study from the Borges Lab</p>
<p>deserves attention, I believe.</p>
<p>This is a paper published just recently,</p>
<p>February 25th, this year, 2022,</p>
<p>in Nature Neuroscience, an excellent journal.</p>
<p>And the title of the paper is</p>
<p>The Preference for Sugar over Sweetener</p>
<p>Depends on a Gut Sensor Cell.</p>
<p>The Borges Lab has now discovered a neuropod cell,</p>
<p>meaning a category of neurons,</p>
<p>that can distinguish between sweet things in the gut</p>
<p>that contain calories, for instance, sugar,</p>
<p>and things in the gut that are sweet</p>
<p>but do not contain calories,</p>
<p>artificial sweeteners like aspartame, sucralose,</p>
<p>and so forth.</p>
<p>There are also, of course,</p>
<p>non-artificial, non-caloric sweeteners</p>
<p>like stevia, monk fruit, et cetera.</p>
<p>They did not explore the full gallery</p>
<p>of artificial sweeteners.</p>
<p>What they did find, however,</p>
<p>ought to pertain to all forms</p>
<p>of sweet, non-caloric substances.</p>
<p>What they discovered was</p>
<p>that there is a signature pattern of signals</p>
<p>sent from the gut to the brain</p>
<p>when we ingest artificial or non-caloric sweeteners.</p>
<p>This is important because what it says</p>
<p>is that at a subconscious level,</p>
<p>the gut can distinguish between sweet things</p>
<p>that contain calories and sweet things that do not.</p>
<p>Now, what the downstream consequences</p>
<p>of this sensing is or what they are isn&rsquo;t yet clear.</p>
<p>Now, I believe everyone should be aware</p>
<p>of these kinds of studies for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s important to understand</p>
<p>that what you crave,</p>
<p>meaning the foods you crave and the drinks you crave,</p>
<p>is in part due to your conscious experience</p>
<p>of the taste of those things,</p>
<p>but also due to biochemical and neural events</p>
<p>that start in the body and impinge on your brain</p>
<p>and cause you to seek out certain things</p>
<p>even though you might not know</p>
<p>why you&rsquo;re seeking out more sugar.</p>
<p>You find that you&rsquo;re craving a lot of sugar</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re craving a lot of foods with artificial sweeteners</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t necessarily know why.</p>
<p>Now, artificial sweeteners themselves</p>
<p>are a somewhat controversial topic.</p>
<p>I want to highlight that.</p>
<p>Some months back, I described a study from Yale University</p>
<p>about how one can condition the insulin system.</p>
<p>Insulin is involved in mobilizing a blood sugar</p>
<p>and so forth in the body, as many of you know,</p>
<p>and I described some studies</p>
<p>that were done from Yale University School of Medicine</p>
<p>looking at how artificial sweeteners</p>
<p>can actually evoke an insulin response</p>
<p>under certain conditions.</p>
<p>Now, a couple of key things.</p>
<p>I got a little bit of pushback after covering those studies</p>
<p>and I encourage pushback all the time.</p>
<p>Pushback is one of those things</p>
<p>that forces all of us to drill deeper into a topic.</p>
<p>I want to be clear.</p>
<p>First of all, I am not one to demonize artificial sweeteners.</p>
<p>There is evidence in animal models, in animal models,</p>
<p>that artificial sweeteners can disrupt the gut microbiome,</p>
<p>but those were fairly high doses of artificial sweeteners</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s unclear if the same thing pertains to humans.</p>
<p>Still unclear, I should say.</p>
<p>Has not been investigated thoroughly.</p>
<p>Some people don&rsquo;t like the taste of artificial sweeteners.</p>
<p>Some people do.</p>
<p>Some people find that they really help them</p>
<p>avoid excessive caloric intake.</p>
<p>Some people believe, and yet I should emphasize,</p>
<p>there still isn&rsquo;t evidence</p>
<p>that they can adjust the insulin response in all people.</p>
<p>I just want to repeat that three times</p>
<p>so that people are clear on that fact.</p>
<p>What these new data emphasize, however,</p>
<p>is that we need to understand how artificial sweeteners</p>
<p>are consumed at the level of the gut,</p>
<p>or I should say registered at the level of the gut</p>
<p>and how that changes brain function.</p>
<p>Because one thing that I&rsquo;m familiar with</p>
<p>and that many people report</p>
<p>is that when they first taste artificial sweeteners,</p>
<p>they taste sort of not right to them.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t like the taste, but over time,</p>
<p>they actually start to crave that taste.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve experienced this.</p>
<p>I used to drink a lot of diet sodas</p>
<p>when I was in graduate school.</p>
<p>So this would be aspartame.</p>
<p>And I found that I actually needed them.</p>
<p>Now, maybe it was the caffeine.</p>
<p>Maybe I just liked the sweet taste or the carbonation.</p>
<p>We actually have a drive for carbonation,</p>
<p>which is a topic of a future episode.</p>
<p>But when I finally quit them</p>
<p>for reasons that were independent</p>
<p>of any fear of artificial sweeteners,</p>
<p>I found that I didn&rsquo;t like the taste.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I only occasionally drink a diet soda.</p>
<p>I usually do that if I&rsquo;m on a plane</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s nothing else available to me.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t demonize them.</p>
<p>I might drink one every once in a while.</p>
<p>No big deal.</p>
<p>I also want to be clear.</p>
<p>I consume Stevia on a number of different supplements</p>
<p>and foods that I consume.</p>
<p>Stevia, of course,</p>
<p>is a plant-based non-caloric sweetener.</p>
<p>So I myself consume artificial sweeteners.</p>
<p>Many people hate them.</p>
<p>Many people like them and find them useful</p>
<p>for their nutrition and in fact,</p>
<p>to keep their caloric intake in a range</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right for them.</p>
<p>And many people like myself are curious about them</p>
<p>and somewhat wary of them</p>
<p>and yet continue to consume them in small amounts.</p>
<p>I think most people probably fall into that category.</p>
<p>I should also mention that many food manufacturers</p>
<p>put artificial sweeteners,</p>
<p>such as sucralose, et cetera, into foods.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s always been unclear</p>
<p>as to why they might want to do that.</p>
<p>And yet we know that the sweet taste consumption,</p>
<p>even if it doesn&rsquo;t contain calories,</p>
<p>can drive more craving of sweet food.</p>
<p>So there may be a logic or a strategy to why they do that.</p>
<p>Again, a topic for exploration on today&rsquo;s podcast</p>
<p>and in future podcasts,</p>
<p>because where we&rsquo;re headed today</p>
<p>is a discussion about how salt and salt sensing,</p>
<p>both consciously and unconsciously,</p>
<p>can adjust our craving for other things</p>
<p>like sugar and water and so on.</p>
<p>So I want to highlight this beautiful work</p>
<p>from the Borges Lab.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll put a link to the study.</p>
<p>I want to open this as a chapter for further exploration.</p>
<p>I like to think that the listeners of this podcast</p>
<p>are looking for answers where we have answers,</p>
<p>but are also, I would hope,</p>
<p>excited about some of the new and emerging themes</p>
<p>in what we call nutritional neurobiology.</p>
<p>And indeed, the Borges Lab really stands</p>
<p>as one of the premier laboratories out there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s looking at how foods, as consumed in the gut,</p>
<p>are modifying our nervous system,</p>
<p>the foods we crave, and how we utilize those foods.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need, and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>

<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects of our brain</p>
<p>and body health, even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine.</p>
<p>Many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3</p>
<p>and K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>

<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works.</p>
<p>Different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need</p>
<p>and none of the things you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means it has salt, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>so-called electrolytes,</p>
<p>which are critical for neuronal function</p>
<p>and a lot of other biological functions.</p>
<p>As I mentioned on the podcast before, I&rsquo;m a fan of salt.</p>
<p>I believe in ingesting appropriate amounts of salt,</p>
<p>and by appropriate, I mean,</p>
<p>depending on what your background blood pressure</p>
<p>happens to be, what your activity levels are,</p>
<p>how much you sweat,</p>
<p>what your cognitive and physical demands are.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to talk about how to determine</p>
<p>what those needs are.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always trying to stay on top of my hydration,</p>
<p>and as you&rsquo;ll also learn about today,</p>
<p>salt and water intake and hydration are intimately related.</p>
<p>With Element, I&rsquo;m sure to get the potassium,</p>
<p>the sodium, and the magnesium that I need,</p>
<p>and I do that in a great tasting drink,</p>
<p>and as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>it has no sugar.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to drinkelement.com.</p>

<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s talk about salt.</p>
<p>Salt has many, many important functions</p>
<p>in the brain and body.</p>
<p>For instance, it regulates fluid balance,</p>
<p>how much fluid you desire and how much fluid you excrete.</p>
<p>It also regulates your desire for salt itself,</p>
<p>meaning your salt appetite.</p>
<p>You have a homeostatically driven salt appetite.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about the mechanisms today</p>
<p>and make them all very clear.</p>
<p>What that means is that you crave salty things,</p>
<p>beverages and foods, when your salt stores are low,</p>
<p>and you tend to avoid salty beverages and foods</p>
<p>when your salt stores are high,</p>
<p>although that&rsquo;s not always the case.</p>
<p>There are circumstances where you will continue</p>
<p>to crave salt, even though you don&rsquo;t need salt,</p>
<p>or indeed, even if you need to eliminate salt</p>
<p>from your system.</p>
<p>Salt also regulates your appetite for other nutrients,</p>
<p>things like sugar, things like carbohydrates.</p>
<p>And today we&rsquo;ll explore all of that.</p>
<p>Technically, salt is a mineral.</p>
<p>And I should mention that when I say salt,</p>
<p>I am indeed referring to sodium in most cases,</p>
<p>although I will be clear to distinguish salt from sodium,</p>
<p>meaning table salt from sodium.</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t realize this,</p>
<p>but one gram of table salt</p>
<p>contains about 388 milligrams of sodium.</p>
<p>So technically, we should be talking about sodium today</p>
<p>and not salt.</p>
<p>I will use them interchangeably,</p>
<p>unless I&rsquo;m referring to some specific recommendations</p>
<p>or ideas about trying to define your ideal salt,</p>
<p>aka sodium intake.</p>
<p>Okay, so this is important.</p>
<p>I think right off the bat,</p>
<p>a lot of people get themselves into a place of confusion</p>
<p>and potentially even to a place of trouble</p>
<p>by thinking that table salt in grams</p>
<p>always equates to sodium in grams,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s simply not the case.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to explore the neural mechanisms</p>
<p>by which we regulate our salt appetite</p>
<p>and the way that the brain and body interact</p>
<p>in the context of salt seeking, salt avoidance,</p>
<p>how to determine when we need more salt,</p>
<p>when we need less salt.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about kidney function.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get into all of it,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to do it very systematically.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start in the brain.</p>
<p>We all harbor small sets of neurons.</p>
<p>We call these sets of neurons nuclei,</p>
<p>meaning little clusters of neurons</p>
<p>that sense the levels of salt in our brain and body.</p>
<p>There are a couple of brain regions that do this,</p>
<p>and these brain regions are very, very special,</p>
<p>special because they lack biological fences around them</p>
<p>that other brain areas have,</p>
<p>and those fences, or I should say that fence,</p>
<p>goes by a particular name,</p>
<p>and that name is the blood-brain barrier, or BBB.</p>
<p>Most substances that are circulating around in your body</p>
<p>do not have access to the brain,</p>
<p>in particular, large molecules</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t just pass into the brain.</p>
<p>The brain is a privileged organ in this sense.</p>
<p>There are a couple other organs that are privileged</p>
<p>and that have very strict barriers,</p>
<p>very particular fences, if you will,</p>
<p>and those other organs include things</p>
<p>like the ovaries and testes,</p>
<p>and that makes sense for the following reason.</p>
<p>First of all, the brain, at least most of the brain,</p>
<p>cannot regenerate after injury.</p>
<p>You just simply can&rsquo;t replace brain cells after injury.</p>
<p>I know people get really excited about neurogenesis,</p>
<p>the birth of new neurons,</p>
<p>and indeed, neurogenesis has been demonstrated</p>
<p>in animal models, and to some extent,</p>
<p>it exists in humans in a few places,</p>
<p>for instance, the olfactory bulb,</p>
<p>where neurons are responsible for detecting odorants</p>
<p>in the environment, for smell, that is,</p>
<p>and in a little subregion of the hippocampus,</p>
<p>a memory area, there&rsquo;s probably some neurogenesis,</p>
<p>but the bulk of really good data out there</p>
<p>point to the fact that in humans,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not much turnover of neurons.</p>
<p>What that means is that the neurons you&rsquo;re born with</p>
<p>are the ones that you&rsquo;re going to be using</p>
<p>most, if not all, of your life.</p>
<p>In fact, you&rsquo;re born with many more neurons</p>
<p>than you&rsquo;ll have later,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a process of naturally occurring cell death</p>
<p>called apoptosis that occurs during development,</p>
<p>so you actually are born with many more neurons</p>
<p>than you have later in life,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the reflection of a normal, healthy process</p>
<p>of nerve cell elimination.</p>
<p>The estimates vary, but anywhere from a third</p>
<p>to maybe even a half or even two thirds of neurons,</p>
<p>depending on the brain area,</p>
<p>are just going to die across development.</p>
<p>That might sound terrible,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s actually one of the ways in which you go</p>
<p>from being kind of like a little potato bug</p>
<p>flopping around helplessly in your crib</p>
<p>to being an organism that can walk and talk</p>
<p>and articulate and calculate math</p>
<p>or do whatever it is that you do for a living.</p>
<p>The brain has a set of elements,</p>
<p>these nerve cells and other cells,</p>
<p>and it needs to use those for the entire lifespan,</p>
<p>so having a BBB, a blood-brain barrier,</p>
<p>around the brain is absolutely critical.</p>
<p>The ovaries and testes have a barrier</p>
<p>for, we assume, the reason that they contain</p>
<p>the genetic material by which we can pass on our genes</p>
<p>to our offspring, progeny, meaning make children,</p>
<p>and those children will have our genes</p>
<p>or at least half of them.</p>
<p>The other half from the partner, of course.</p>
<p>If the cells within the ovaries and testes are mutated,</p>
<p>well, then you can get mutations in offspring,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s very costly in the evolutionary sense,</p>
<p>so it makes sense that you would have</p>
<p>a barrier from the blood,</p>
<p>so if you ingest what&rsquo;s called a mutagen,</p>
<p>if you ingest something that can mutate the genes of cells,</p>
<p>you can imagine why there would be a premium</p>
<p>on not allowing those mutagens to get into the brain,</p>
<p>the ovaries, or the testes, okay?</p>
<p>So the brain has this BBB,</p>
<p>this blood-brain barrier around it,</p>
<p>which makes it very, very hard for substances</p>
<p>to pass into the brain unless those substances</p>
<p>are very small or those substances and molecules</p>
<p>are critically required for brain function.</p>
<p>However, there are a couple of regions in the brain</p>
<p>that have a fence around them, but that fence is weaker,</p>
<p>okay, it&rsquo;s sort of like going from a really big wall,</p>
<p>thick, electronic, 24-hour surveillance fence</p>
<p>where nothing can pass through</p>
<p>except only the exclusive cargo that&rsquo;s allowed to go through</p>
<p>to having a little cyclone fence</p>
<p>with a couple of holes in it,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s kind of a picket fence that&rsquo;s falling over,</p>
<p>and substances can move freely from the blood</p>
<p>circulating in the body into the brain,</p>
<p>and it turns out that the areas of the brain</p>
<p>that monitor salt balance and other features</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s happening in the body</p>
<p>at the level of what we call osmolarity,</p>
<p>at the concentration of salt reside</p>
<p>in these little sets of neurons</p>
<p>that sit just on the other side of these weak fences,</p>
<p>and the most important and famous of these</p>
<p>for the sake of today&rsquo;s conversation is one called OVLT.</p>
<p>OVLT stands for the organum vasculosum</p>
<p>of the lateral terminalis.</p>
<p>It is what&rsquo;s called a circumventricular organ.</p>
<p>Why circumventricular?</p>
<p>Well, not to bog you down with neuroanatomy,</p>
<p>but your brain is a big squishy mass</p>
<p>of neurons and other cell types,</p>
<p>but it has to be nourished,</p>
<p>and through the middle of that brain,</p>
<p>there is a tube, there&rsquo;s a hollow that creates spaces,</p>
<p>and those spaces are called ventricles.</p>
<p>The ventricles are spaces</p>
<p>in which cerebral spinal fluid circulates,</p>
<p>and it nourishes the brain.</p>
<p>It does a number of other things as well.</p>
<p>The circumventricular organs are areas of the brain</p>
<p>that are near that circulating fluid,</p>
<p>and that circulating fluid has access to the bloodstream,</p>
<p>and the bloodstream has access to it,</p>
<p>and this structure that I&rsquo;m referring to,</p>
<p>OVLT, organum vasculosum of the lateral terminalis,</p>
<p>has neurons that can sense the contents of the blood</p>
<p>and to some extent, the cerebral spinal fluid.</p>
<p>There are a couple other brain areas</p>
<p>that can do this as well.</p>
<p>They go also by the name of circumventricular organs,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll talk about the names of some of those other areas,</p>
<p>but for today, and I think for sake</p>
<p>of most of the discussion,</p>
<p>understand that the OVLT is special.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because it doesn&rsquo;t have this thick barrier fence,</p>
<p>which sounds like a bad thing,</p>
<p>and yet it&rsquo;s a terrific border detector.</p>
<p>The neurons in that region are able to pay attention</p>
<p>to what&rsquo;s passing through in the bloodstream</p>
<p>and can detect, for instance,</p>
<p>if the levels of sodium in the bloodstream are too low,</p>
<p>if the level of blood pressure in the body</p>
<p>is too low or too high,</p>
<p>and then the OVLT can send signals to other brain areas,</p>
<p>and then those other brain areas</p>
<p>can do things like release hormones</p>
<p>that can go and act on tissues</p>
<p>in what we call the periphery in the body,</p>
<p>and for instance, have the kidneys secrete more urine</p>
<p>to get rid of salt, that&rsquo;s excessive salt in the body,</p>
<p>or have the kidneys hold on to urine</p>
<p>to hold on to whatever water or fluid that one might need.</p>
<p>So before I go any deeper into this pathway,</p>
<p>just understand that the OVLT has a very limited barrier.</p>
<p>It can detect things in the bloodstream,</p>
<p>and this incredible area of the brain</p>
<p>almost single-handedly sets off the cascades of things</p>
<p>that allow you to regulate your salt balance,</p>
<p>which turns out to be absolutely critical,</p>
<p>not just for your ability to think</p>
<p>and for your neurons to work, but indeed for all of life.</p>
<p>If the OVLT doesn&rsquo;t function correctly,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re effectively dead or dead soon.</p>
<p>So this is a very important brain region.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about the function of the OVLT</p>
<p>and flesh out some of the other aspects of its circuitry,</p>
<p>of its communication with other brain areas</p>
<p>and with the body in the context of something</p>
<p>that we are all familiar with, which is thirst.</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered just why you get thirsty?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s because neurons in your OVLT</p>
<p>are detecting changes in your bloodstream,</p>
<p>which detect global changes within your body.</p>
<p>And in response to that,</p>
<p>your OVLT sets off certain events within your brain and body</p>
<p>that make you either want to drink more fluid</p>
<p>or to stop drinking fluid.</p>
<p>There are two main kinds of thirst.</p>
<p>The first one is called osmotic thirst,</p>
<p>and the second is called hypovolemic thirst.</p>
<p>Osmotic thirst has to do with the concentration of salt</p>
<p>in your bloodstream.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you ingest something very, very salty.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you ingest a big bag of,</p>
<p>I confess I don&rsquo;t eat these very often,</p>
<p>but I really like those kettle potato chips</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re pretty salty.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never actually measured how much sodium is in them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the information is there.</p>
<p>Every once in a while,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m particularly interested in doing so,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just down a bag of those things.</p>
<p>And I really like them and they&rsquo;re very salty,</p>
<p>but they almost always make me feel thirsty.</p>
<p>And the reason is that by eating those,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ingested a lot of sodium.</p>
<p>Again, not a frequent occurrence for me,</p>
<p>but happens every now and again.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t have too much shame about that</p>
<p>because I think I have a pretty healthy relationship to food</p>
<p>and I enjoy them.</p>
<p>And I understand that it will drive salt levels</p>
<p>up in my bloodstream and that will cause me to be thirsty.</p>
<p>But why?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because neurons in the OVLT come in two main varieties.</p>
<p>One variety senses the osmolarity of the blood</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s getting across that weak little fence</p>
<p>that we talked about before.</p>
<p>And when the osmolarity,</p>
<p>meaning the salt concentration in the blood is high,</p>
<p>it activates these specific neurons in the OVLT.</p>
<p>And by activates,</p>
<p>I mean it causes them to send electrical potentials,</p>
<p>literally send electrical signals to other brain areas.</p>
<p>And those other brain areas inspire a number</p>
<p>of different downstream events.</p>
<p>So what are those other brain areas?</p>
<p>Well, the OVLT signals to an area</p>
<p>called the supraoptic nucleus.</p>
<p>The name and why it&rsquo;s called the supraoptic nucleus</p>
<p>is not necessarily important.</p>
<p>It also signals to the so-called paraventricular nucleus,</p>
<p>another nucleus that sits near the ventricles</p>
<p>and can monitor the qualities,</p>
<p>the chemical qualities of the cerebral spinal fluid,</p>
<p>as well as probably the bloodstream as well.</p>
<p>And the consequence of that communication</p>
<p>is that a particular hormone is eventually released</p>
<p>from the posterior pituitary.</p>
<p>Now, the pituitary is a gland</p>
<p>that sits near the roof of your mouth.</p>
<p>It releases all sorts of things like growth hormone</p>
<p>and luteinizing hormone.</p>
<p>Luteinizing hormone will stimulate things like estrogen</p>
<p>and testosterone production</p>
<p>and release from the ovaries and testes and so on.</p>
<p>The pituitary has a bunch of different compartments</p>
<p>and functions, but what&rsquo;s really cool about the pituitary</p>
<p>is that certain regions of the pituitary</p>
<p>actually contain the axons, the wires of neurons,</p>
<p>and the neurons reside in the brain.</p>
<p>And so the supraoptic nucleus gets a signal from the OVLT.</p>
<p>The signal is purely in the form of electrical activity.</p>
<p>Remember, neurons aren&rsquo;t talking to one another</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s happening out there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not saying, hey, there&rsquo;s too much salt</p>
<p>in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do something about it.</p>
<p>All they receive are our so-called action potential,</p>
<p>waves of electricity.</p>
<p>The neurons in the supraoptic nucleus</p>
<p>then release their own electrical signals</p>
<p>within the pituitary.</p>
<p>And some of those neurons and nearby neurons</p>
<p>are capable of releasing hormones</p>
<p>as well as electrical signals.</p>
<p>So from the pituitary, there&rsquo;s a hormonal signal</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s released called vasopressin.</p>
<p>Vasopressin also goes by the name antidiuretic hormone.</p>
<p>And antidiuretic hormone has the capacity</p>
<p>to either restrict the amount of urine that we secrete</p>
<p>or when that system is turned off</p>
<p>to increase the amount of urine that we secrete.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a complicated set of cascades</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s evoked by having high salt concentration</p>
<p>in the blood.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a complicated set of cascades</p>
<p>that are evoked by having low concentrations</p>
<p>of sodium in the blood.</p>
<p>But the pathway is nonetheless the same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s OVLT is detecting those osmolarity changes,</p>
<p>communicating to the supraoptic nucleus.</p>
<p>Supraoptic nucleus is either causing the release of</p>
<p>or is releasing vasopressin, antidiuretic hormone,</p>
<p>or that system is shut off</p>
<p>so that the antidiuretic hormone is not secreted,</p>
<p>which would allow urine to flow more freely, right?</p>
<p>Antidiuretic means anti-release of urine.</p>
<p>And by shutting that off,</p>
<p>you are going to cause the release of urine.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re sort of allowing a system to flow, so to speak.</p>
<p>The second category of thirst is hypovolemic thirst.</p>
<p>Hypovolemic thirst occurs</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a drop in blood pressure, okay?</p>
<p>So the OVLT, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>can sense osmolarity based on the fact</p>
<p>that it has these neurons that can detect</p>
<p>how much salt is in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>But the OVLT also harbors neurons</p>
<p>that are of the baroreceptor mechanoreceptor category.</p>
<p>Now, more on baroreceptors and mechanoreceptors later,</p>
<p>but baroreceptors are essentially a receptor,</p>
<p>meaning a protein that&rsquo;s in a cell</p>
<p>that responds to changes in blood pressure.</p>
<p>So there are a number of things</p>
<p>that can cause decreases in blood pressure.</p>
<p>Some of those include, for instance,</p>
<p>if you lose a lot of blood, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re bleeding quite a lot,</p>
<p>or in some cases, if you vomit quite a lot,</p>
<p>or if you have extensive diarrhea</p>
<p>or any combination of those.</p>
<p>And there are other things that can reduce blood volume,</p>
<p>and we will talk about some of those later.</p>
<p>But in the classic case of hypovolemic thirst,</p>
<p>one is simply losing blood,</p>
<p>and therefore blood pressure goes down.</p>
<p>So very simple to imagine in your mind,</p>
<p>you have these pipes,</p>
<p>which are the arteries, veins, and capillaries.</p>
<p>And when you lose some blood volume,</p>
<p>the pressure in those arteries, veins,</p>
<p>and capillaries goes down.</p>
<p>OVLT has neurons that can sense</p>
<p>that reduction in blood pressure</p>
<p>because of the presence of baroreceptors in OVLT.</p>
<p>There are other elements that also play into the response</p>
<p>to what we call hypovolemic thirst.</p>
<p>For instance, the kidney will secrete</p>
<p>something called renin.</p>
<p>Renin will activate something called angiotensin II</p>
<p>from the lungs of all things, amazing.</p>
<p>And angiotensin II itself can act on OVLT,</p>
<p>organobasculosomal lateral terminalis,</p>
<p>which in turn will create thirst, okay?</p>
<p>So in both cases, right,</p>
<p>the osmolarity sensing system,</p>
<p>meaning osmotic thirst,</p>
<p>and in hypovolemic thirst, where blood pressure has dropped,</p>
<p>the end result is a desire to drink more.</p>
<p>And that desire to drink more</p>
<p>comes through a variety of pathways</p>
<p>that are both direct and indirect,</p>
<p>include vasopressin and don&rsquo;t include vasopressin.</p>
<p>But I think for just sake of general example,</p>
<p>and even for those of you that don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>any biology background or physiology background,</p>
<p>just understand that there are two main types of thirst.</p>
<p>Both types of thirst,</p>
<p>osmotic thirst and hypovolemic thirst,</p>
<p>are not just about seeking water,</p>
<p>but they also are about seeking salt.</p>
<p>In very general terms, salt, aka sodium,</p>
<p>can help retain water.</p>
<p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t mean that salt always retains water.</p>
<p>If you have excessive amounts of salt,</p>
<p>will you retain excessive amounts of water?</p>
<p>Well, sort of, as we&rsquo;ll soon learn, it&rsquo;s all contextual.</p>
<p>But for most cases,</p>
<p>we can say that by having salt in our system,</p>
<p>our brain and our body can function normally,</p>
<p>provided the levels of salt are adequate</p>
<p>and not too high or too low.</p>
<p>And thirst, while we often think of it</p>
<p>as just a way to bring fluid into our body,</p>
<p>is designed as a kind of a interoceptive perception.</p>
<p>What I mean by that,</p>
<p>interoception as many of you know now</p>
<p>from listening to this podcast,</p>
<p>is a paying of attention or a recognition rather,</p>
<p>a conscious recognition of the events</p>
<p>going on within our body.</p>
<p>So when we are thirsty,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a certain form of interoception.</p>
<p>We go, oh, I need something, or I crave something.</p>
<p>You may not know exactly what you need,</p>
<p>but when you are thirsty, you&rsquo;re not just seeking water,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re also seeking to balance your osmolarity,</p>
<p>which means you may be seeking salty fluids or foods.</p>
<p>In some cases, you&rsquo;ll try and accomplish this by eating,</p>
<p>or it may be that you&rsquo;re trying to avoid,</p>
<p>or you will be inspired to avoid salty fluids and foods.</p>
<p>But if you want to understand sodium</p>
<p>and its roles in the body, you have to understand thirst.</p>
<p>And if you want to understand thirst,</p>
<p>you have to understand how fluid balance</p>
<p>is regulated in the body.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not surprising at all.</p>
<p>But sodium and water work together</p>
<p>in order to generate what we call thirst.</p>
<p>Sodium water work together in order to either retain water</p>
<p>or inspire us to let go of water to urinate.</p>
<p>So before we can dive into the specifics around salt</p>
<p>and how to use salt for performance</p>
<p>and various recommendations and things to avoid,</p>
<p>we need to drill a little bit deeper</p>
<p>into this fluid balance mechanism in the body.</p>
<p>And for that reason, we have to pay</p>
<p>at least a little bit of attention to the kidney.</p>
<p>The kidney is an incredible organ.</p>
<p>And one of the reasons the kidney is so amazing</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s responsible for both retaining, holding onto,</p>
<p>or allowing the release of various substances from the body,</p>
<p>substances like glucose or amino acids, urea, uric acid,</p>
<p>salt, potassium, magnesium.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically a filter,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a very, very intelligent filter.</p>
<p>I mean, intelligent, meaning it doesn&rsquo;t have its own mind,</p>
<p>but the way it works is really beautiful.</p>
<p>Basically, blood enters the kidney</p>
<p>and it goes through a series of tubes,</p>
<p>which are arranged into loops.</p>
<p>If you want to look more into this,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the beautiful loop of Henle</p>
<p>and other aspects of the kidney design</p>
<p>that allow certain substances to be retained</p>
<p>and other substances to be released,</p>
<p>depending on how concentrated</p>
<p>those substances are in the blood.</p>
<p>The kidney responds to a number of hormonal signals,</p>
<p>including vasopressin, in order to, for instance,</p>
<p>antidiuretic hormone, in order to hold onto more fluid,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s what your brain and body need.</p>
<p>And it responds to other hormonal signals as well.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a pretty complex organ.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there&rsquo;s a key point,</p>
<p>which I already mentioned,</p>
<p>that I think most people don&rsquo;t realize.</p>
<p>This is actually something that I like to tell kids</p>
<p>when I meet them, provided that they&rsquo;re of appropriate age.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say, oftentimes when kids learn that I&rsquo;m a scientist,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll ask a question about something related to science</p>
<p>and hopefully, for my sake,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something about neuroscience.</p>
<p>But one thing that I&rsquo;ll tell kids, I&rsquo;ll say,</p>
<p>do you know that your urine, your pee,</p>
<p>is actually filtered blood?</p>
<p>And occasionally, that will really terrify a kid,</p>
<p>but that also occasionally really terrifies an adult.</p>
<p>But indeed, your urine is filtered blood.</p>
<p>Basically, blood gets into the kidney.</p>
<p>The kidney is going to filter out certain things.</p>
<p>Certain things are going to be allowed to pass through</p>
<p>and others are not, okay?</p>
<p>So the way the kidney is designed</p>
<p>is that about 90% of the stuff that&rsquo;s absorbed</p>
<p>from the blood is going to be absorbed early</p>
<p>in this series of tubes.</p>
<p>And only a small percentage is going to be regulated</p>
<p>or worked out as you get into</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called the distal kidney.</p>
<p>I mean, distal just means the furthest part away, okay?</p>
<p>The proximal is up close.</p>
<p>So like your shoulder is proximal</p>
<p>to your midline of your body and your hand is distal.</p>
<p>So in biological terms, you hear about proximal distal,</p>
<p>which just means near or far from.</p>
<p>So just to give a really simple example,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say that you are very low on fluid.</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t had much to drink in a while.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re walking around on a hot day.</p>
<p>Chances are that the neurons in your OVLT</p>
<p>will sense the increase in osmolarity, right?</p>
<p>The concentration of salt is going to be increased</p>
<p>relative to the fluid volume that&rsquo;s circulating.</p>
<p>This of course assumes that you haven&rsquo;t excreted</p>
<p>a lot of sodium for one reason or another,</p>
<p>but that increase in osmolarity is detected by the OVLT.</p>
<p>The OVLT is going to signal a bunch of different cascades</p>
<p>through the supraoptic nucleus, et cetera.</p>
<p>And then vasopressin is going to be released</p>
<p>into the bloodstream and vasopressin,</p>
<p>again, also called antidiuretic hormone,</p>
<p>is going to act on the kidney</p>
<p>and change the kidney&rsquo;s function</p>
<p>in a couple of different ways,</p>
<p>some mechanical, some chemical, okay?</p>
<p>In order to make sure that your kidney</p>
<p>does not release much water,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make you want to urinate.</p>
<p>And in fact, even if you would try to urinate,</p>
<p>your body&rsquo;s going to tend to hold on to its fluid stores.</p>
<p>Okay, so very simple, straightforward example.</p>
<p>We can also give the other example</p>
<p>whereby if you are ingesting a lot, a lot, a lot of water,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not a particularly hot day</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not sweating very much,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s assume your salt intake is constant</p>
<p>or is low for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Well, then the osmolarity,</p>
<p>the salt concentration in your blood is going to be lower.</p>
<p>Your OVLT will detect that</p>
<p>because of these osmosensing neurons in your OVLT.</p>
<p>Your OVLT will fail to signal to the supraoptic nucleus</p>
<p>and there will not be the release</p>
<p>of vasopressin antidiuretic hormone</p>
<p>and you can excrete all the water</p>
<p>that your body wants to excrete,</p>
<p>meaning you&rsquo;ll be able to urinate.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no holding on to water at the level of the kidney.</p>
<p>Okay, very simple examples,</p>
<p>but hopefully it illustrates how events within the blood,</p>
<p>meaning the concentration of salt</p>
<p>relative to the amount of fluid, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what osmolarity is, is detected by the OVLT.</p>
<p>The brain then communicates to the pituitary.</p>
<p>The pituitary sends a hormone out into the blood</p>
<p>and the hormone acts on the kidney</p>
<p>to either hold onto or let go of fluid,</p>
<p>meaning to prevent you from wanting to urinate</p>
<p>or from stimulating you to want to urinate.</p>
<p>Very, very simple kind of yes, no type situation here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of nuance to this in reality.</p>
<p>There are a lot of other hormones in this pathway,</p>
<p>but I think for at least this stage of the discussion,</p>
<p>this should be sufficient.</p>
<p>Some of you may have noticed</p>
<p>that a molecule we&rsquo;ve been talking a lot about today,</p>
<p>vasopressin, was also mentioned on a previous episode</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>but in a very different context.</p>
<p>Molecule I&rsquo;m referring to is vasopressin</p>
<p>and as I mentioned, it&rsquo;s a hormone involved in antidiuresis,</p>
<p>meaning preventing urination.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an antidiuretic,</p>
<p>but we also talked about vasopressin</p>
<p>in the context of desire, love, and attachment.</p>
<p>We talked about it in the context of monogamy</p>
<p>and non-monogamy in a species of animal</p>
<p>called the prairie vole.</p>
<p>You can check out that episode.</p>
<p>I believe vasopressin and the non-monogamous prairie voles</p>
<p>are mentioned in the timestamp, so it should be easy to find.</p>
<p>Vasopressin is made at multiple locations</p>
<p>in the nervous system, mainly the superoptic nucleus,</p>
<p>and indeed, it&rsquo;s also involved in aspects</p>
<p>of sexual behavior and mating.</p>
<p>Now, it does that through mechanisms</p>
<p>that are distinct from its antidiuretic effects.</p>
<p>In fact, there are people who take vasopressin</p>
<p>as an aphrodisiac.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m certainly not suggesting people do that,</p>
<p>but I have all the confidence in the world</p>
<p>that the moment I talk about vasopressin,</p>
<p>someone in the comments is going to say,</p>
<p>what do you think about vasopressin nasal sprays</p>
<p>and this kind of thing?</p>
<p>Vasopressin and indeed oxytocin,</p>
<p>another hormone that&rsquo;s involved in pair bonding</p>
<p>and various aspects of brain and body function,</p>
<p>are available as nasal sprays that can get up</p>
<p>into the deep recesses of the brain</p>
<p>and can impact some of these core,</p>
<p>what we call hypothalamic functions,</p>
<p>these primitive drives and hypothalamic functions.</p>
<p>I would encourage a lot of caution,</p>
<p>maybe even extreme caution in recreational use</p>
<p>of things like vasopressin and oxytocin,</p>
<p>unless you are working with an MD and they prescribe it</p>
<p>or they really know what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>These are powerful hormones</p>
<p>that have a lot of different effects on the brain and body.</p>
<p>The way that vasopressin, meaning antidiuretic hormone,</p>
<p>prevents the release of fluid as urine from the body</p>
<p>is pretty interesting.</p>
<p>It acts directly on the kidney.</p>
<p>So as I mentioned before, blood flows into the kidney.</p>
<p>A number of things are retained</p>
<p>in the early part of the kidney.</p>
<p>Vasopressin acts at a fairly distal,</p>
<p>meaning kind of end game,</p>
<p>part of the loops of tubes through the kidney,</p>
<p>and it increases the permeability of those tubes.</p>
<p>In other words, it makes sure that the fluid</p>
<p>that would otherwise pass into a collecting duct</p>
<p>and then go out to the bladder,</p>
<p>never actually makes it to the bladder.</p>
<p>I point this out because what antidiuretic hormone does</p>
<p>is it prevents the bladder from filling at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as if it locks fluid in the bladder</p>
<p>and prevents you from urinating.</p>
<p>I think the way I&rsquo;ve been describing things up until now</p>
<p>and the way you&rsquo;ll hear about antidiuretic hormone,</p>
<p>it might sound like it kind of locks up the bladder</p>
<p>or prevents you from being able to urinate,</p>
<p>but you have a full bladder.</p>
<p>That would be very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the way it works.</p>
<p>It actually causes the tubes headed towards the bladder</p>
<p>from the kidney to become permeable,</p>
<p>meaning to allow fluid to go back into the bloodstream</p>
<p>into the rest of the body</p>
<p>so that fluid never actually fills the bladder</p>
<p>and so you never feel the urge to urinate.</p>
<p>Now, this is an episode about salt.</p>
<p>A key thing to understand about the kidney</p>
<p>is that the kidney uses sodium in order to conserve water,</p>
<p>which has everything to do with the fact</p>
<p>that sodium can actually hold water.</p>
<p>Put differently, water tends to follow sodium.</p>
<p>So where we have sodium, we tend to have water</p>
<p>and sodium, when it&rsquo;s concentrated, can hold onto water.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the main ways</p>
<p>that the kidney holds onto water in the body.</p>
<p>And as we&rsquo;ll soon learn,</p>
<p>there is no simple and direct formula to say,</p>
<p>for instance, okay, if salt levels are high,</p>
<p>a lot of water is retained.</p>
<p>And if salt levels are low, a lot of water is released.</p>
<p>On the one hand, that can be true,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also the case</p>
<p>because these systems are homeostatic,</p>
<p>meaning they&rsquo;re always seeking balance,</p>
<p>both within system, within the salt system,</p>
<p>and between systems, the salt and water system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the case often that if we have enough sodium,</p>
<p>well, then we can secrete sodium and some water will follow.</p>
<p>Or if we don&rsquo;t have enough sodium, then yes, indeed,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re not holding onto water,</p>
<p>more fluid can be excreted.</p>
<p>But if that condition of low sodium lasts long enough,</p>
<p>then we start to retain water</p>
<p>because the body recognizes, ah, salt is low</p>
<p>and water is being excreted</p>
<p>and eventually a system will kick in to retain water.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d love to give you a simple black and white,</p>
<p>yes or no answer for low sodium, high sodium,</p>
<p>moderate sodium, and water balance,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all contextual.</p>
<p>And when I say contextual,</p>
<p>I mean it will depend on blood pressure,</p>
<p>hypertension, pre-hypertension, if that&rsquo;s there,</p>
<p>maybe normal tension, hormone levels,</p>
<p>exercise, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>A pretty good example of how complicated this can all be</p>
<p>is one that some of you may be familiar with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty well known that during certain phases</p>
<p>of the menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>when estrogen and progesterone</p>
<p>and other hormones are fluctuating,</p>
<p>that water can be retained in the body.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s called edema or a swelling sometimes.</p>
<p>So the common assumption, and indeed it can be true,</p>
<p>that when estrogen levels are high,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s water retention in the body.</p>
<p>Also in males, if estrogen levels are high,</p>
<p>there can be water retention in the body.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why athletes</p>
<p>and in particular bodybuilders who take anabolic steroids</p>
<p>like testosterone, which can be converted into estrogens,</p>
<p>sometimes they&rsquo;ll look, they&rsquo;ll walk around,</p>
<p>they look like they were partially inflated.</p>
<p>They look like they&rsquo;re going to pop</p>
<p>and it looks like a swelling of the skin,</p>
<p>not just because they have large muscles.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not always, but often water retention</p>
<p>due to testosterone conversion into estrogen.</p>
<p>Now that all sounds consistent, right?</p>
<p>Estrogen levels fluctuate in the menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>In males where there&rsquo;s an increase in estrogen,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s retention of water.</p>
<p>But actually estrogen acts as a diuretic.</p>
<p>So one would think, okay, when estrogen levels go up,</p>
<p>there should be a lot of fluid excreted.</p>
<p>But I bring up this example to point out</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a very complicated and dynamic balance</p>
<p>between hormones and salt and fluid.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t draw a one-to-one relationship there.</p>
<p>And that turns out to be a very important point.</p>
<p>And we can use that not as a way</p>
<p>to further complicate things,</p>
<p>but as a way to understand under which contexts</p>
<p>less sodium intake or more sodium intake can be beneficial.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;d like to turn our attention now.</p>
<p>So how much salt do we need?</p>
<p>And what can we trust in terms of trying to guide</p>
<p>our ingestion of salt?</p>
<p>First of all, I want to be very, very clear</p>
<p>that there are a number of people out there</p>
<p>that have prehypertension or hypertension.</p>
<p>You need to know if you have prehypertension</p>
<p>or hypertension.</p>
<p>You need to know if you have normal tension,</p>
<p>meaning normal blood pressure.</p>
<p>Everyone should know their blood pressure</p>
<p>is an absolutely crucial measurement</p>
<p>that has a lot of impact on your immediate</p>
<p>and long-term health outcomes.</p>
<p>It informs a lot about what you should do.</p>
<p>Should you be doing more cardiovascular exercise?</p>
<p>Should you be ingesting more or less salt?</p>
<p>Should you be adjusting any number</p>
<p>of different lifestyle factors?</p>
<p>So you need to know that.</p>
<p>And without knowing what your blood pressure is,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t give a one-size-fits-all recommendation.</p>
<p>And indeed, I&rsquo;m not going to give medical recommendations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m simply going to spell out what I know about the research</p>
<p>which hopefully will point you in the direction</p>
<p>of figuring out what&rsquo;s right for you</p>
<p>in terms of salt and indeed fluid intake.</p>
<p>There is a school of thought</p>
<p>that everybody is consuming too much salt.</p>
<p>And I do want to highlight the fact</p>
<p>that there are dozens, if not hundreds,</p>
<p>of quality papers that point to the fact</p>
<p>that a quote-unquote high-salt diet can be bad</p>
<p>for various organs and tissues in the body,</p>
<p>including the brain.</p>
<p>It just so happens that because fluid balance,</p>
<p>both inside and outside of cells, is crucial,</p>
<p>not just for your heart and for your lungs</p>
<p>and for your liver and for all the organs of your body,</p>
<p>but also for your brain,</p>
<p>that if the salt concentration inside of cells</p>
<p>in your brain becomes too high, neurons suffer, right?</p>
<p>They will draw fluid into those cells</p>
<p>because water tends to follow salt,</p>
<p>as I mentioned before, and those cells can swell.</p>
<p>You can literally get swelling of brain tissue.</p>
<p>Conversely, if salt levels are too low inside of cells</p>
<p>in any tissue of the body, but in the brain included,</p>
<p>then the cells of the body and brain can shrink</p>
<p>because water is pulled into the extracellular space</p>
<p>away from cells.</p>
<p>And indeed, under those conditions,</p>
<p>brain function can suffer,</p>
<p>and indeed, the overall health of the brain can suffer.</p>
<p>So there are many reports out there</p>
<p>indicating, both in experimental models</p>
<p>and to some extent in humans,</p>
<p>that overconsumption of salt is bad</p>
<p>for brain function and longevity,</p>
<p>and yet there is also decent evidence</p>
<p>in both animal models and humans</p>
<p>that if salt consumption is too low,</p>
<p>then brain health and longevity will suffer,</p>
<p>as will other organs and tissues of the body.</p>
<p>So like most things in biology,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want things too high or too low.</p>
<p>Now, I would say that the vast majority</p>
<p>of studies out there point to the fact</p>
<p>that a high salt diet is detrimental</p>
<p>to brain health and function.</p>
<p>Most of the studies have focused on that aspect</p>
<p>of salt balance and its consequences on brain function.</p>
<p>One critical issue with many of those studies, however,</p>
<p>is that the high salt diet is often coupled</p>
<p>to other elements of diet that are also unhealthy,</p>
<p>things like excessively high levels of carbohydrates</p>
<p>or fats or combinations of carbohydrates and fats.</p>
<p>And so while I know there are many burning questions</p>
<p>out there about how much salt one needs</p>
<p>if they are on a low carbohydrate diet,</p>
<p>or if they are fasting, or if they are on a vegan diet,</p>
<p>there have simply not been many studies</p>
<p>that have explored the low, moderate,</p>
<p>and high salt conditions</p>
<p>on a backdrop of very controlled nutrition.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably reflective of the fact</p>
<p>that there are not a lot</p>
<p>of very well-controlled nutrition studies out there.</p>
<p>There are some, of course,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very hard to get people to adhere</p>
<p>to nutritional plans in a very strict way</p>
<p>and to do that for sufficient periods of time</p>
<p>that would allow the various health outcomes to occur.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there&rsquo;s some interesting reports</p>
<p>that indicate that the amount of salt intake</p>
<p>can indeed predict health outcomes</p>
<p>or what we call hazardous events,</p>
<p>things like cardiovascular events and stroke and so forth.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting is that indeed a lower,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying low, right?</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t believe that you want your diet</p>
<p>to be truly low in anything except perhaps poison,</p>
<p>but a lower salt diet can reduce the number</p>
<p>of these so-called hazardous events,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a somewhat of a shallow U-shaped function</p>
<p>such that yes, indeed,</p>
<p>a high salt intake can be very detrimental for your health,</p>
<p>both in terms of cardiovascular events,</p>
<p>stroke, and other deleterious health events,</p>
<p>but somewhere in the middle</p>
<p>that actually sits quite to the right,</p>
<p>meaning higher than what is typically recommended</p>
<p>for salt intake,</p>
<p>can actually reduce the number of these hazardous events.</p>
<p>At least some reports point to that.</p>
<p>And so I want to emphasize</p>
<p>what one of those particular reports says,</p>
<p>and I also want to be sure to counter it</p>
<p>from the perspective of the context</p>
<p>that that study was set in,</p>
<p>because again, my goal here is not to give you</p>
<p>a strict set of recommendations at all,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s to point you to the literature,</p>
<p>try and make that literature as clear as possible</p>
<p>and allow you to evaluate for yourself.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t just say that to protect us,</p>
<p>I say that to protect you,</p>
<p>because indeed you are responsible</p>
<p>for your health and your health choices.</p>
<p>So the paper that I&rsquo;m referring to</p>
<p>is a very interesting one.</p>
<p>We of course never want to put too much weight</p>
<p>on any one report,</p>
<p>but this is a paper that was published in 2011</p>
<p>in the Journal of the American Medical Association.</p>
<p>The title of the paper is</p>
<p>Urinary Sodium and Potassium Excretion</p>
<p>and a Risk of Cardiovascular Events.</p>
<p>We have not talked much about potassium yet,</p>
<p>but sodium and potassium tend to work in concert</p>
<p>in the brain and body</p>
<p>in order to regulate various physiological functions</p>
<p>and health.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk more about potassium as time goes on.</p>
<p>The key plot or set of data in this study,</p>
<p>for those of you that want to look it up,</p>
<p>we will link to it.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of data in here,</p>
<p>but is figure one,</p>
<p>which is basically evaluating the amount</p>
<p>of urinary excretion of sodium,</p>
<p>which is a somewhat indirect,</p>
<p>but nonetheless valuable measure</p>
<p>of how much sodium people were ingesting.</p>
<p>And plotted against that</p>
<p>is what they call the hazard ratio.</p>
<p>And the hazard ratio points to the composite</p>
<p>of cardiovascular death, stroke, myocardial infarction,</p>
<p>and an infarct is an injury,</p>
<p>and hospitalization for congestive heart failure.</p>
<p>And what it points to is the fact that the hazard ratio</p>
<p>is low-ish at sodium excretion of about two grams per day,</p>
<p>but then continues to go down</p>
<p>until about 4.5 to five grams per day.</p>
<p>Remember this is sodium excretion.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s reflective of how much sodium was in the body,</p>
<p>which is reflective of how much sodium was ingested.</p>
<p>And then the hazard ratio increases fairly dramatically,</p>
<p>a very steep slope,</p>
<p>heading anywhere from seven to eight to 10</p>
<p>and out towards 12 grams of sodium excretion per day.</p>
<p>So the simplest way to interpret these data</p>
<p>are that at fairly low levels of sodium,</p>
<p>meaning at about two grams per day,</p>
<p>you run fewer health risks,</p>
<p>but the number of risk continues to decline</p>
<p>as you move towards four and five grams per day.</p>
<p>And then as you increase your salt intake further,</p>
<p>then the risk dramatically increases.</p>
<p>So no study is holy, nor is any figure in any study</p>
<p>or any collection of studies holy.</p>
<p>Rather, we always want to look at what the bulk of data</p>
<p>in a particular field reveal.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I think that the plot that we described,</p>
<p>meaning the graph that we described is pretty interesting</p>
<p>in light of the 2020 to 2025 dietary recommendations</p>
<p>for Americans, which is that people consume</p>
<p>no more than 2.3 grams,</p>
<p>meaning 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about a half a teaspoon of salt per day.</p>
<p>Now, most people are probably consuming more than that</p>
<p>because of the fact that they are ingesting processed foods</p>
<p>and processed foods tend to have more salt in them</p>
<p>than non-processed foods.</p>
<p>Now, of course, that&rsquo;s not always the case, right?</p>
<p>Sea salt is not a processed food in most cases.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of unprocessed foods</p>
<p>that can be high in sodium,</p>
<p>but processed foods in particular</p>
<p>tend to have a lot of sodium.</p>
<p>You can see this simply by looking at the packaging</p>
<p>of any number of different foods.</p>
<p>But if we were to take this number of 2.3 grams,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the recommended cutoff for ingestion of sodium,</p>
<p>it actually falls in a portion of the curve</p>
<p>that we were talking about a moment ago</p>
<p>that indeed is associated with low incidence</p>
<p>of hazardous outcomes, cardiovascular events, stroke,</p>
<p>et cetera.</p>
<p>But according to that plot,</p>
<p>the ingestion of four or five grams of sodium,</p>
<p>almost double or more sodium than is currently recommended</p>
<p>is associated with even lower numbers of hazardous events.</p>
<p>So we need to think about this</p>
<p>and we need to explore it in the context</p>
<p>of other studies, of course.</p>
<p>And we need to evaluate it in terms of this thing</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been going back to again and again,</p>
<p>which is context, right?</p>
<p>These recommendations of 2.3 gram per day cutoff</p>
<p>is in the context of a landscape</p>
<p>where some people do indeed have hypertension</p>
<p>or prehypertension.</p>
<p>The incidence of hypertension has gone up dramatically</p>
<p>in the last hundred years</p>
<p>and seems to continue to go up.</p>
<p>Whether or not that&rsquo;s because of increased salt intake</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s because of increased salt intake</p>
<p>and other things such as highly processed foods,</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t clear.</p>
<p>Again, pointing to the challenge</p>
<p>in doing these epidemiological studies</p>
<p>and really parsing what aspects of a change</p>
<p>in some health metric is due to, for instance,</p>
<p>the ingestion of more sugars versus more salts</p>
<p>or simply because of the ingestion of more salts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complicated, almost barbed wire topic by now,</p>
<p>but we can start to pull apart that barbed wire tangle</p>
<p>and start to evaluate some of the other people</p>
<p>in other conditions that exist out there, maybe for you,</p>
<p>that actually warrant more sodium intake</p>
<p>and where more sodium intake might actually be beneficial.</p>
<p>So again, I want to be very, very clear</p>
<p>that you need to know your blood pressure.</p>
<p>If you have high blood pressure or you&rsquo;re prehypertensive,</p>
<p>you should be especially cautious</p>
<p>about doing anything that increases your blood pressure.</p>
<p>And as always, you want to, of course,</p>
<p>talk to your doctor about doing anything</p>
<p>that could adjust your health in any direction.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, there are some important papers</p>
<p>that have been published in recent years.</p>
<p>I want to point to one of them in particular.</p>
<p>This is a paper that was published</p>
<p>in the journal Autonomic Neuroscience, Basic and Clinical,</p>
<p>because this paper, like several other papers,</p>
<p>ask the question, and indeed they ask the question</p>
<p>in the title, it&rsquo;s a review,</p>
<p>dietary sodium and health,</p>
<p>how much is too much for those with orthostatic disorders?</p>
<p>Now, orthostatic disorders</p>
<p>come in a bunch of different varieties,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to talk about those in a moment,</p>
<p>but there are a number of people out there</p>
<p>that have low blood pressure, right?</p>
<p>People that get dizzy when they stand up,</p>
<p>people that are feeling chronically fatigued,</p>
<p>and in some cases, not all,</p>
<p>those groups can actually benefit</p>
<p>from increasing their sodium intake.</p>
<p>Several episodes ago on the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>I gave a, what, it&rsquo;s just clearly what we call anecdata,</p>
<p>which is not even really data, it&rsquo;s just anecdotal data</p>
<p>of an individual who was always feeling hungry</p>
<p>and craving sugar, and based on the fact</p>
<p>that they also had low blood pressure,</p>
<p>I had them talk to a physician,</p>
<p>and they got permission to try</p>
<p>a little mini experiment on themselves,</p>
<p>and so they did, and that mini experiment was</p>
<p>anytime they felt like they were craving sugar</p>
<p>or they were feeling a little lightheaded and dizzy,</p>
<p>rather than reaching for something with caloric intake,</p>
<p>they took a little bit of sea salt,</p>
<p>a little pinch of sea salt,</p>
<p>and put it into some water and drank it,</p>
<p>or in the case of this individual,</p>
<p>they would actually take a little sea salt packet,</p>
<p>and they would actually just down a sea salt packet,</p>
<p>and for them, that provided tremendous relief</p>
<p>for their dizziness, but that, of course,</p>
<p>was in the context of somewhat abnormally low blood pressure,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t think that they are alone in the fact</p>
<p>that many people out there suffer</p>
<p>from a low blood pressure condition.</p>
<p>Many people out there suffer</p>
<p>from a high blood pressure condition,</p>
<p>so know your blood pressure and understand</p>
<p>that blood pressure in part is regulated</p>
<p>by your sodium intake and your sodium balance.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, because of the osmolarity of blood</p>
<p>that we talked about before,</p>
<p>where if you have a certain concentration of sodium,</p>
<p>meaning sufficient sodium in your bloodstream,</p>
<p>that will tend to draw water into the bloodstream,</p>
<p>and essentially, the pipes that are your capillaries,</p>
<p>arteries, and veins will be full.</p>
<p>The blood pressure will get up to your head,</p>
<p>whereas some people, their blood pressure is low</p>
<p>because the osmolarity of their blood is low,</p>
<p>and that can have a number of downstream consequences.</p>
<p>I should also mention it can be the consequence itself</p>
<p>of challenges or even deficits in kidney function,</p>
<p>but all of these organs are working together,</p>
<p>so the encouragement here is not necessarily</p>
<p>to ingest more sodium.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to know your blood pressure</p>
<p>and to address whether or not an increase in sodium intake</p>
<p>would actually benefit your blood pressure</p>
<p>in a way that could relieve some of the dizziness</p>
<p>and other symptoms of things like orthostatic disorders,</p>
<p>but of course, to do that in a safe context</p>
<p>and to never play games with your blood sugar</p>
<p>or your blood osmolarity that could set your system</p>
<p>down a cascade of negative events.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at what the current recommendations are</p>
<p>for people that suffer from orthostatic disorders,</p>
<p>like orthostatic hypo, meaning too low tension,</p>
<p>orthostatic hypotension,</p>
<p>postural tachycardia syndrome,</p>
<p>sometimes referred to as POTS, P-O-T-S,</p>
<p>or idiopathic orthostatic tachycardia and syncope.</p>
<p>These have the incredibly elaborate names.</p>
<p>Those groups are often told to increase their salt intake</p>
<p>in order to combat their symptoms.</p>
<p>The American Society of Hypertension</p>
<p>recommends anywhere from 6,000 to 10,000.</p>
<p>These are very high levels.</p>
<p>So this is six grams to 10 grams of salt per day,</p>
<p>keeping in mind, again, that salt is not the same as sodium</p>
<p>so that equates to about 2,400 to 4,000 milligrams</p>
<p>of sodium per day.</p>
<p>Again, if you want to learn more about this</p>
<p>and get more of the citations,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll refer you back to this study</p>
<p>on dietary sodium and health,</p>
<p>how much is too much for those with orthostatic disorders.</p>
<p>We will put a link to this in the caption show notes.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not just in the US.</p>
<p>The salt recommendations</p>
<p>from the Canadian Cardiovascular Society</p>
<p>are 10,000 milligrams of salt per day.</p>
<p>So four grams of sodium is what that equates to</p>
<p>and on and on and on for things like POTS,</p>
<p>for these postural syndromes that result from,</p>
<p>or I should say from these syndromes</p>
<p>that involve low blood pressure when people stand up</p>
<p>or in certain postures.</p>
<p>So I point out this paper</p>
<p>and I point out these higher salt recommendations</p>
<p>to emphasize again, that context is vital, right?</p>
<p>That people with high blood pressure</p>
<p>are going to need certain amounts of salt intake.</p>
<p>People with lower blood pressure</p>
<p>and maybe with some of these postural orthostatic syndromes</p>
<p>are going to need higher amounts of salt.</p>
<p>And for most people out there,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to need to evaluate how much salt intake</p>
<p>is going to allow your brain and body to function optimally.</p>
<p>And there are some fairly straightforward ways</p>
<p>to explore that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some ways to explore that</p>
<p>in the context of what you already know</p>
<p>about thirst and salt appetite</p>
<p>that can make that exploration</p>
<p>one in which it&rsquo;s not going to be a constant</p>
<p>wandering around in the dark</p>
<p>and where you can figure out what&rsquo;s right for you.</p>
<p>For most people, a moderate increase in salt intake</p>
<p>is not going to be detrimental</p>
<p>provided that you consume enough fluids,</p>
<p>in particular water, okay?</p>
<p>Meaning if you happen to overeat salt a bit,</p>
<p>you will get thirsty, you will ingest more water</p>
<p>and you will excrete the excess sodium.</p>
<p>There is evidence that the body can store sodium</p>
<p>in various organs.</p>
<p>That storage of sodium may or may not be</p>
<p>a detrimental thing.</p>
<p>In general, excess storage of sodium</p>
<p>in tissues and organs of the brain and body</p>
<p>is not thought to be good for long-term health.</p>
<p>So eating much more sodium than you need</p>
<p>for long periods of time is indeed bad for you.</p>
<p>Earlier, I mentioned that salt</p>
<p>and your hunger and thirst for salt</p>
<p>is homeostatically regulated.</p>
<p>And indeed that&rsquo;s the case,</p>
<p>much like temperature is homeostatically regulated.</p>
<p>What that means is if you pay attention to it,</p>
<p>if your salt levels are low,</p>
<p>you will tend to crave salt</p>
<p>and salty beverages and salty foods.</p>
<p>And in most cases, you should probably follow that craving</p>
<p>provided those salty beverages and salty foods</p>
<p>are not bringing in a lot of other things</p>
<p>or anything ideally that&rsquo;s bad for you.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s fair to say</p>
<p>that whether or not you&rsquo;re vegan, vegetarian,</p>
<p>carnivore, omnivore,</p>
<p>that we should all try to limit</p>
<p>our ingestion of processed foods.</p>
<p>My read of the literature is that sure,</p>
<p>some processed foods are acceptable for us</p>
<p>and aren&rsquo;t going to kill us outright,</p>
<p>but that for most people in the world,</p>
<p>eating fewer processed foods</p>
<p>is just going to be a good thing to do.</p>
<p>So following your salt hunger and thirst in most cases</p>
<p>is going to be beneficial</p>
<p>provided that it&rsquo;s in the context</p>
<p>of eating healthy non-processed foods</p>
<p>on whatever backdrop of nutritional</p>
<p>and dietary recommendations is right for you.</p>
<p>I simply can&rsquo;t tell you what to eat and what not to eat</p>
<p>because I acknowledge the fact that some people are vegans</p>
<p>because of ethical reasons related to animals</p>
<p>or some people are vegans because of reasons</p>
<p>related to the climate and the environment.</p>
<p>Other people do it for specific health reasons.</p>
<p>Likewise, I know plenty of people that eat meat</p>
<p>and avoid vegetables, believe it or not.</p>
<p>And I know people that eat both</p>
<p>and they do this often each, I should say,</p>
<p>all citing literature that supports their particular camp</p>
<p>and their particular view.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a territory I want to get into,</p>
<p>but with respect to salt intake</p>
<p>and the fact that salt intake is homeostatically regulated,</p>
<p>it is the case that if you&rsquo;re craving salt,</p>
<p>you probably need it.</p>
<p>So for those of you that are sweating excessively</p>
<p>or even if you&rsquo;re in a very hot environment</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not exercising and you&rsquo;re just losing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re losing water and salt from your system,</p>
<p>remember also that you can be in a very cold environment,</p>
<p>very cold, dry environments often go together</p>
<p>and you can be losing a lot of fluids from your body</p>
<p>and you will crave fluids and salt even though it&rsquo;s cold</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not actually noticeably perspiring.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re exercising a lot,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in a particular cold, dry environment</p>
<p>or a particular hot environment,</p>
<p>you ought to be ingesting sufficient amounts</p>
<p>of salt and fluid.</p>
<p>A rule of thumb for exercise-based replenishment of fluid</p>
<p>comes from what some episodes back</p>
<p>referred to as the Galpin equation.</p>
<p>The Galpin equation, I named it after Andy Galpin</p>
<p>and I think that is the appropriate attribution there.</p>
<p>Andy Galpin is an exercise physiologist</p>
<p>at Cal State Fullerton, I believe.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s going to be a podcast guest</p>
<p>here on the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an exceptional muscle physiologist.</p>
<p>He also lives in the practical realm</p>
<p>where he gives recommendations about exercise</p>
<p>to expert athletes as well as the everyday person.</p>
<p>So the Galpin equation is based on the fact</p>
<p>that we lose about one to five pounds of water per hour,</p>
<p>which can definitely impact our mental capacity</p>
<p>and our physical performance.</p>
<p>And the reason that loss of water from our system</p>
<p>impacts mental capacity and physical performance</p>
<p>has a lot to do with literally the changes</p>
<p>in the volume of those cells, the size of those cells</p>
<p>based on how much sodium is contained</p>
<p>in or outside those cells.</p>
<p>And something that I&rsquo;ve alluded to before on the podcast</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll talk about more in a moment,</p>
<p>which is that neurons signal to one another</p>
<p>by way of electricity</p>
<p>through something called the action potential.</p>
<p>And that actually requires sodium</p>
<p>and potassium and magnesium.</p>
<p>So the Galpin equation suggests</p>
<p>that we start exercise hydrated with electrolytes,</p>
<p>not just with water.</p>
<p>So that means water that has some sodium,</p>
<p>potassium, and magnesium.</p>
<p>There are simple low-cost ways to do that we&rsquo;ll talk about.</p>
<p>And the formula for hydration,</p>
<p>the so-called Galpin equation,</p>
<p>is your body weight in pounds divided by 30</p>
<p>equals the ounces of fluid you should drink</p>
<p>every 15 minutes.</p>
<p>That may turn out to be more fluid</p>
<p>than you can comfortably consume</p>
<p>during the activity that you&rsquo;re performing.</p>
<p>Now, the Galpin equation is mainly designed for exercise,</p>
<p>but I think is actually a very good rule of thumb</p>
<p>for any time that you need to engage mental capacity,</p>
<p>not just physical performance.</p>
<p>Your body weight in pounds divided by 30</p>
<p>equals the ounces of fluid you should drink</p>
<p>every 15 minutes,</p>
<p>does not necessarily mean you have to ingest it</p>
<p>every 15 minutes on the dot.</p>
<p>And I think many activities, physical activities,</p>
<p>but also cognitive activities like Zoom meetings</p>
<p>or in-person meetings or lecturing or running or cycling</p>
<p>are going to make it complicated to ingest</p>
<p>the appropriate amount of fluid</p>
<p>every 15 minutes on the dot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to speak for Andy, for Dr. Galpin,</p>
<p>but I think he would probably agree</p>
<p>that these are averages to shoot for.</p>
<p>And that unless you&rsquo;re hyper-neurotic,</p>
<p>the idea is to make sure that you&rsquo;re entering the activity,</p>
<p>cognitive or physical, sufficiently hydrated,</p>
<p>and that throughout that activity,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re hydrating regularly.</p>
<p>And it points to the fact that most people</p>
<p>are probably under hydrating,</p>
<p>but not just under hydrating from the perspective</p>
<p>of not ingesting enough water,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re probably not getting enough electrolytes</p>
<p>as well, sodium, potassium, and magnesium.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve said two somewhat contradictory things.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I said, follow your salt appetite,</p>
<p>follow your salt thirst.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re craving salt,</p>
<p>ingest some salt until you stop craving the salt.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I&rsquo;ve given you</p>
<p>this fairly specific recommendation</p>
<p>based on the Galpin equation,</p>
<p>that you should ingest your body weight in pounds</p>
<p>divided by 30.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how many ounces of fluid</p>
<p>you should drink every 15 minutes,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m guessing for most people</p>
<p>is going to be more fluid</p>
<p>than they&rsquo;re currently drinking on average.</p>
<p>And so how could it be that you can have a recommendation</p>
<p>for what&rsquo;s optimal that&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>than the amount that you would reflexively drink?</p>
<p>And it has to do with the fact</p>
<p>that a lot of the hormone systems,</p>
<p>like vasopressin, antidiuretic hormone,</p>
<p>other hormones like aldosterone,</p>
<p>and a lot of the neural and hormonal signals</p>
<p>that govern salt and water balance</p>
<p>are fairly slow to kick in.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you eat a fairly salty meal</p>
<p>and you sense that salt, you&rsquo;ll probably,</p>
<p>meaning you detect it and perceive it,</p>
<p>because the food tastes salty,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll probably want to drink</p>
<p>a fair amount of fluid with it.</p>
<p>Whereas if some of the salt is disguised by other flavors,</p>
<p>something that we&rsquo;ll talk about in a few minutes</p>
<p>when we talk about the neural representation</p>
<p>of things like salty and sweet,</p>
<p>well, then you might not notice that something&rsquo;s salty.</p>
<p>And then a few minutes or hours after ingesting that meal,</p>
<p>you might feel very, very tired.</p>
<p>You might even wonder whether or not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because of some blood sugar effect.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a crash in blood sugar, you might think,</p>
<p>or something else related to that meal,</p>
<p>or maybe you think it&rsquo;s because of</p>
<p>some other event in your life.</p>
<p>But actually what has happened is you&rsquo;re dehydrated</p>
<p>because you didn&rsquo;t recognize</p>
<p>that you needed to drink more fluids.</p>
<p>So I want to acknowledge the contradiction</p>
<p>in the idea that everything is homeostatically regulated</p>
<p>and therefore you are aware of what you need.</p>
<p>And the counter argument that,</p>
<p>ah, you need to follow these strict recommendations,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually going to be somewhere in between.</p>
<p>And of course, your body and brain can start to adapt</p>
<p>to certain levels of salt intake.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a now fairly famous study</p>
<p>that was done in Germany,</p>
<p>which looked at different phases of salt intake,</p>
<p>meaning they had subjects ingest</p>
<p>either 12 grams of salt per day,</p>
<p>or nine grams per day, or six grams per day</p>
<p>for fairly long periods of time.</p>
<p>And they collected urine for testing.</p>
<p>This was actually a very controlled study.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to paraphrase</p>
<p>from the National Institutes of Health report on this study</p>
<p>because they did a very nice write-up of it.</p>
<p>And they say that, you know,</p>
<p>a big surprise of these results is that</p>
<p>whatever the level of salt that was consumed,</p>
<p>sodium was stored and released from the subject&rsquo;s bodies</p>
<p>in fairly regular weekly and monthly patterns,</p>
<p>meaning people tended to adapt</p>
<p>to a certain level of salt intake.</p>
<p>And then it led to a fairly constant amount</p>
<p>of salt retention and urine fluid excretion.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because of the various hormones like aldosterone,</p>
<p>which regulate sodium excretion from the kidney,</p>
<p>and glucocorticoids,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll talk about more in a moment,</p>
<p>which help regulate metabolism.</p>
<p>Glucocorticoids are released from the adrenal glands,</p>
<p>which ride atop the kidneys.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a very close relationship</p>
<p>between the stress system, glucocorticoids,</p>
<p>and the salt system.</p>
<p>So the reason why your salt appetite</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t a perfect readout of how much salt you should ingest</p>
<p>and why it might be helpful to follow</p>
<p>some of these formulas like the Galpin equation,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re engaging in exercise,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re going to be perspiring, of course,</p>
<p>is that your body will tend to adapt</p>
<p>to a certain amount of salt intake over time.</p>
<p>And then your appetite for salt</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t necessarily be the best indication</p>
<p>of how much salt you should ingest or avoid.</p>
<p>Before I move on, I want to really reemphasize the fact</p>
<p>that inside of the Galpin equation,</p>
<p>there is that mention of every 15 minutes.</p>
<p>And people have come back to me again and again</p>
<p>about this saying,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t drink that much water every 15 minutes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too much volume of fluid in my stomach.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t run with that, et cetera.</p>
<p>Remember, these are averages.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what you want to average</p>
<p>around a particular activity.</p>
<p>These are not strict recommendations</p>
<p>where a buzzer goes off and every 15 minutes,</p>
<p>you have to chug that exact amount</p>
<p>of electrolyte containing solution.</p>
<p>Another key feature of the study</p>
<p>that I was referring to before,</p>
<p>which incidentally was published</p>
<p>in the Journal of Clinical Investigation,</p>
<p>is that the body regulates its salt and water balance,</p>
<p>not just by excreting sodium,</p>
<p>but by retaining or releasing water.</p>
<p>And this is because of the relationship</p>
<p>between sodium and water that we were talking about before.</p>
<p>And the advantage of this mechanism,</p>
<p>they state here, I&rsquo;m paraphrasing,</p>
<p>is that the long-term maintenance of body fluids</p>
<p>is not as dependent on external water as once believed.</p>
<p>What the system probably evolved to do</p>
<p>was to adjust to different levels</p>
<p>of sodium availability in the environment.</p>
<p>And that raises a really key element of salt</p>
<p>and its importance in human history</p>
<p>and human evolution and human health.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t talked too much about this,</p>
<p>and there are several very good books</p>
<p>about the history of salt.</p>
<p>You know, salt was a very valuable</p>
<p>and heavily sought after substance</p>
<p>throughout much of human history,</p>
<p>so much so that there are actually written reports</p>
<p>of people being paid for labor in the form of salt.</p>
<p>And salt, when it&rsquo;s scarce,</p>
<p>has been quite expensive in certain regions of the world,</p>
<p>especially regions located further away from the sea.</p>
<p>And a friend of mine who has deep roots</p>
<p>within the culinary community told me about traveling</p>
<p>to some somewhat impoverished areas of Europe</p>
<p>some years ago and going into homes</p>
<p>where in the middle of the kitchen table,</p>
<p>there was a fish, a salty fish,</p>
<p>hanging from a thread above the table.</p>
<p>And that because of a lack of availability of table salt,</p>
<p>the common practice was to take any food</p>
<p>that needed some salt for additional flavoring</p>
<p>and to actually rub that food on this salty fish</p>
<p>or to squeeze the fish a bit onto the food substance</p>
<p>in order to get salt from it.</p>
<p>So, you know, that&rsquo;s a very kind of extreme example.</p>
<p>Nowadays, we kind of take salt for granted,</p>
<p>and most of the discussion out there is about excess salt.</p>
<p>But as I&rsquo;m pointing out that, you know,</p>
<p>salt for a long time has been a very sought after commodity</p>
<p>and one that people really cherished for their health.</p>
<p>In the episode that I did on metabolism,</p>
<p>I talked about the relationship between salt and iodine.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in iodine</p>
<p>and whether or not iodized salt or non-iodized salt</p>
<p>is best or required,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d encourage you to listen to that episode,</p>
<p>which was about, again, metabolism.</p>
<p>Some people may need more iodine intake.</p>
<p>Some people perhaps do not.</p>
<p>Some people might even want to ingest things like kelp.</p>
<p>Some people might not.</p>
<p>So please listen to that episode</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in the iodine aspects of salt,</p>
<p>which have direct impact on thyroid hormone</p>
<p>and thyroid function,</p>
<p>which of course relates to metabolism.</p>
<p>Nowadays, there&rsquo;s a lot of interest in,</p>
<p>and even a kind of proliferation of what I call fancy salts.</p>
<p>So whether or not you should be ingesting sea salts</p>
<p>or whether or not common table salt will suffice.</p>
<p>In most cases, for what we&rsquo;re discussing here,</p>
<p>common table salt is fine,</p>
<p>but I should point out that sea salt</p>
<p>often contains other minerals, which can be very useful.</p>
<p>And we will do entire episodes on those other minerals.</p>
<p>So sea salt can contain dozens or more of minerals,</p>
<p>some of which can be quite valuable to our health,</p>
<p>others of which are less important</p>
<p>and only need to be consumed in trace amounts,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not going to get many minerals,</p>
<p>if any, from common table salt.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why, in addition to the pretty colors</p>
<p>and perhaps some people report</p>
<p>that it actually tastes better,</p>
<p>some of these so-called fancy salts or sea salts,</p>
<p>you might want to consume a more advanced form of salt,</p>
<p>if you will.</p>
<p>Although I suppose it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>the more primitive form of salt,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s actually the one that comes from the ocean.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve all heard about how excess salt,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s bad for blood pressure,</p>
<p>damage the heart, the brain, et cetera.</p>
<p>I do want to give some voice to situations</p>
<p>where too little salt can actually cause problems.</p>
<p>And this has everything to do with the nervous system.</p>
<p>So without getting into excessive amounts of detail,</p>
<p>the kidneys, as we talked about before,</p>
<p>are going to regulate salt and fluid balance.</p>
<p>The adrenal glands, which ride atop the kidneys,</p>
<p>are going to make glucocorticoids like aldosterone.</p>
<p>And those are going to directly impact</p>
<p>things like fluid balance.</p>
<p>And in part, they do that by regulating</p>
<p>how much craving for and tolerance</p>
<p>of salty solutions we have.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some really nice studies</p>
<p>that have looked at so-called adrenalectomies.</p>
<p>Now, this is an extreme case,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s typically done in animal models,</p>
<p>but it illustrates the role of the adrenals</p>
<p>in salt preference.</p>
<p>Basically, when the glucocorticoid system,</p>
<p>meaning the release of these particular hormones</p>
<p>from the adrenal glands is eliminated by adrenalectomy,</p>
<p>ectomy means removal,</p>
<p>then the threshold for what&rsquo;s considered too salty</p>
<p>really shifts, okay?</p>
<p>So typically, when the adrenals are intact,</p>
<p>a animal or a human will prefer a mildly salty</p>
<p>to moderately salty solution, if given a choice.</p>
<p>And at some point, it&rsquo;s so salty</p>
<p>that it just feels aversive.</p>
<p>Just like taking a gulp of seawater</p>
<p>is almost always aversive.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think of an instance where it&rsquo;s not aversive.</p>
<p>And actually, drinking seawater can kill you</p>
<p>because of the high osmolarity of seawater.</p>
<p>You certainly don&rsquo;t want to drink seawater.</p>
<p>Under conditions where the adrenals are missing,</p>
<p>animals and humans will tend to prefer</p>
<p>a higher sodium concentration fluid,</p>
<p>and they will be willing to tolerate</p>
<p>ingesting very high concentrations of sodium.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s a very crude experiment</p>
<p>and not one that you want to do, I promise you.</p>
<p>But I mention it because it illustrates</p>
<p>the very direct relationship between the stress system,</p>
<p>which is the glucocorticoid system,</p>
<p>and the salt craving system.</p>
<p>And this actually makes sense.</p>
<p>Earlier, as we were talking about hypovolemic thirst,</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a loss of blood pressure,</p>
<p>usually due to a loss of blood from the body,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a salt craving in order</p>
<p>to bring that blood volume back up.</p>
<p>Because by ingesting salt,</p>
<p>you bring fluid into the bloodstream,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re increasing that blood pressure</p>
<p>and you can restore the blood that&rsquo;s lost.</p>
<p>Now, there are many examples where</p>
<p>if sodium levels get too low in the bloodstream,</p>
<p>either because people are ingesting too little salt,</p>
<p>or they are ingesting too much water</p>
<p>and therefore excreting too much salt,</p>
<p>that it can cause stress and anxiety.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some really nice data that point to the fact</p>
<p>that low dietary sodium can actually exacerbate anxiety</p>
<p>in animal models.</p>
<p>And to some extent,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s evidence for this in humans as well.</p>
<p>And that should not come as a surprise.</p>
<p>The whole basis for a relationship</p>
<p>between the adrenal system, these glucocorticoids,</p>
<p>things like aldosterone and the craving for sodium,</p>
<p>is that the stress system is a generic system</p>
<p>designed to deal with various challenges to the organism,</p>
<p>to you, or to me, or to an animal.</p>
<p>And those challenges can arrive in many different forms.</p>
<p>They can be an infection, it can be famine,</p>
<p>it can be lack of water, and so on.</p>
<p>But in general, the stress response</p>
<p>is one of elevated heart rate, elevated blood pressure,</p>
<p>and an ability to maintain movement</p>
<p>and resistance to that challenge, okay?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said this before, but I&rsquo;ll emphasize it again.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this common misperception that stress makes us sick.</p>
<p>And indeed, if stress lasts too long,</p>
<p>it has a number of negative effects on our health.</p>
<p>But more often than not, if we&rsquo;re pushing, pushing, pushing,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re studying or taking care of somebody</p>
<p>or traveling like crazy,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t tend to get sick under those conditions.</p>
<p>But as soon as we stop,</p>
<p>as soon as we reduce our adrenaline output,</p>
<p>as soon as we reduce our glucocorticoid output</p>
<p>from our adrenals, then we will get sick.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very common occurrence.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because stress actually activates</p>
<p>our immune system in the short-term.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to try and dispel this myth</p>
<p>that stress actually suppresses the immune system,</p>
<p>at least not in the short-term.</p>
<p>For long-term stress, it&rsquo;s a different issue.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want long-term ongoing stress,</p>
<p>especially of several weeks or more.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it makes sense that bringing sodium</p>
<p>into the body would be at least one way</p>
<p>that we would be wired to counteract</p>
<p>or to resist stressors, right?</p>
<p>Stressors being the things on the outside coming at us.</p>
<p>So it could be a stressful relationship,</p>
<p>stressful job situation, again, infection, and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear from a number of studies</p>
<p>that if sodium levels are too low,</p>
<p>that our ability to meet stress challenges is impaired.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>to place your sodium intake cosmically high,</p>
<p>but it does point to the fact that if you&rsquo;re feeling anxious,</p>
<p>perhaps from low blood pressure,</p>
<p>which can also give symptoms of anxiety,</p>
<p>as we talked about before,</p>
<p>but even if it&rsquo;s independent of low blood pressure,</p>
<p>that slightly increasing sodium intake,</p>
<p>again, I would encourage people to do this,</p>
<p>not in the context of processed foods and drinks,</p>
<p>but ideally in the form of maybe a little bit</p>
<p>of sea salt and water</p>
<p>or salting one&rsquo;s food a little bit more,</p>
<p>that that can stabilize blood pressure</p>
<p>and one&rsquo;s ability to lean into stressors and challenges.</p>
<p>And I say this because I think that most people assume</p>
<p>that adding salt is always bad,</p>
<p>when in fact, that&rsquo;s simply not the case.</p>
<p>There are conditions such as</p>
<p>when we are under stress challenge,</p>
<p>when there is a natural craving for more sodium,</p>
<p>and that natural craving for more sodium</p>
<p>is hardwired into us as a way to meet that challenge.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard for me to know whether or not people out there,</p>
<p>especially the listeners of this podcast,</p>
<p>are getting too much, just enough, or too little sodium.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t know that, I&rsquo;m shouting into a tunnel here,</p>
<p>you have to decide how much sodium you are ingesting.</p>
<p>But I think that there&rsquo;s some, for most people,</p>
<p>especially people who are not hypertensive,</p>
<p>pre-hypertensive, there&rsquo;s some wiggle room to explore</p>
<p>whether more intake of sodium could actually be beneficial</p>
<p>for suppressing some of the anxiety responses</p>
<p>that they might feel under conditions of stress.</p>
<p>Again, more studies need to be done,</p>
<p>certainly more studies in humans need to be done,</p>
<p>but the relationship between stress and sodium intake</p>
<p>and the fact that additional sodium intake may be beneficial</p>
<p>and indeed is naturally stimulated by stress</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t be necessarily looked at as a pathological event.</p>
<p>I know when some people get stressed,</p>
<p>they crave salty foods,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually a hardwired biological phenomenon</p>
<p>that you see not just in humans, but in animals,</p>
<p>because this is a very primitive mechanism</p>
<p>whereby your body is preparing</p>
<p>to meet any additional challenges and stressors.</p>
<p>Now we can&rsquo;t have a discussion about sodium</p>
<p>without having a discussion about the other electrolytes,</p>
<p>magnesium and potassium.</p>
<p>Magnesium is important enough</p>
<p>and an extensive enough topic</p>
<p>that we should probably do an entire episode</p>
<p>just on magnesium.</p>
<p>For purposes of today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>I just will briefly touch on some of the forms of magnesium</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve discussed on the podcast before</p>
<p>in different contexts.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that many people</p>
<p>are probably getting enough magnesium in their diet</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t need to supplement magnesium.</p>
<p>Some people, however, opt to supplement magnesium</p>
<p>in ways that can support them.</p>
<p>And there are many different forms of magnesium.</p>
<p>And just in very brief passing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just say that there is some evidence</p>
<p>that you can reduce muscle soreness from exercise</p>
<p>by ingestion of magnesium malate, M-A-L-A-T-E.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked before about magnesium threonate,</p>
<p>T-H-R-E-N-O-A-T-E, magnesium threonate,</p>
<p>for sake of promoting the transition into sleep</p>
<p>and for depth of sleep.</p>
<p>And perhaps, again, highlighted perhaps,</p>
<p>because right now it&rsquo;s mainly animal studies</p>
<p>and ongoing human studies, but the data aren&rsquo;t all in,</p>
<p>perhaps magnesium threonate can be used</p>
<p>as a way to support cognitive function and longevity.</p>
<p>That was discussed in the episode</p>
<p>with Dr. Jack Feldman from UCLA.</p>
<p>Typically, magnesium threonate is taken 30 to 60 minutes</p>
<p>before bedtime in order to encourage sleep.</p>
<p>You can go to our Neural Network newsletter</p>
<p>and look for the one on sleep,</p>
<p>and you can see the recommendations,</p>
<p>or I should say the options for that,</p>
<p>because again, you should always check with your physician.</p>
<p>Those aren&rsquo;t strict across the board recommendations.</p>
<p>And then there are other forms of magnesium,</p>
<p>magnesium bisglycinate,</p>
<p>which is somewhat of an alternative to threonate,</p>
<p>not known to have cognitive enhancing effects,</p>
<p>but seems at least on par with magnesium threonate</p>
<p>in terms of promoting transition</p>
<p>into in-depth of sleep and so on.</p>
<p>There are other forms of magnesium, magnesium citrate,</p>
<p>which has other functions.</p>
<p>Actually, magnesium citrate is a fairly effective laxative.</p>
<p>Not known to promote sleep and things of that sort.</p>
<p>So a lot of different forms of magnesium,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s still other forms out there.</p>
<p>Many people are not getting enough magnesium,</p>
<p>many people are.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s magnesium.</p>
<p>Anytime we&rsquo;re talking about sodium balance,</p>
<p>we have to take into consideration potassium,</p>
<p>because the way that the kidney works</p>
<p>and the way that sodium balance is regulated</p>
<p>both in the body and the brain</p>
<p>is that sodium and potassium</p>
<p>are working in close concert with one another.</p>
<p>There are a lot of different recommendations</p>
<p>about ratios out there,</p>
<p>and they range widely from two to one ratio</p>
<p>of potassium to sodium.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard it in the other direction too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard a two to one sodium to potassium.</p>
<p>The recommendations vary.</p>
<p>One of the sponsors of this podcast, for instance, Element,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve talked about in this episode and before,</p>
<p>the ratio there is a gram of sodium</p>
<p>to 200 milligrams of potassium, 60 milligrams of magnesium.</p>
<p>So there they&rsquo;ve opted for a five to one ratio</p>
<p>of sodium to potassium.</p>
<p>And of course, many people opt to make their own</p>
<p>hydration electrolyte formulas.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll put sea salt into some water,</p>
<p>maybe even ingest a potassium tablet.</p>
<p>It all depends on the context.</p>
<p>An important contextual element is your diet.</p>
<p>So for instance, carbohydrates hold water in the body.</p>
<p>So regardless of how much salt</p>
<p>and how much fluid you&rsquo;re ingesting,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re ingesting carbohydrate</p>
<p>and you drink fluids, water,</p>
<p>some of that fluid is going to be retained in the body.</p>
<p>Now for people that are following low carbohydrate diets,</p>
<p>one of the most immediate effects of a low carbohydrate diet</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re going to excrete more water.</p>
<p>And so under those conditions,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re also going to lose not just water,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ll probably also lose sodium and potassium.</p>
<p>And so some people, many people in fact,</p>
<p>find that when they are on a lower or low carbohydrate diet,</p>
<p>then they need to make sure that they&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>enough sodium and enough potassium.</p>
<p>And some people do that</p>
<p>by taking 99 milligram potassium tablets</p>
<p>every time they eat.</p>
<p>Some people do that by ingesting more foods</p>
<p>that contain potassium.</p>
<p>And of course, some people who are on low carbohydrate diets</p>
<p>do ingest vegetables, you know,</p>
<p>or other forms of food that carry along with them, potassium.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s quite variable from person to person.</p>
<p>I mean, you can imagine if carbohydrate holds water,</p>
<p>water and salt balance and potassium go hand in hand</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;re on a low carbohydrate diet,</p>
<p>that you might need to adjust your salt intake and potassium.</p>
<p>And conversely, that if you&rsquo;re on a carbohydrate rich diet</p>
<p>or a moderate carbohydrate diet,</p>
<p>then you may need to ingest less sodium and less potassium.</p>
<p>And in fact, a certain amount of water</p>
<p>is probably coming in through the foods you eat as well.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t say all this to confuse you.</p>
<p>Again, I say this because it all depends on the context.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give yet another context</p>
<p>that I think is fairly common nowadays,</p>
<p>which is many people are following a pattern of eating</p>
<p>that more or less resembles intermittent fasting</p>
<p>or at least time-restricted feeding.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re eating between particular feeding windows.</p>
<p>And then in the certain parts of the 24-hour cycle,</p>
<p>not just sleep,</p>
<p>but during certain parts of their waking cycle,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re also actively avoiding food.</p>
<p>Banking on, I think, either the possible,</p>
<p>I want to say possible,</p>
<p>longevity-promoting effects of intermittent fasting</p>
<p>and or, I should say,</p>
<p>they are banking on the fact that for many people,</p>
<p>not eating is easier than portion control</p>
<p>for certain parts of the day.</p>
<p>And so they find it beneficial to limit calories overall</p>
<p>to a given amount, depending on what their goals are,</p>
<p>by not consuming food for certain periods of the day.</p>
<p>But usually during those periods of the day,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re consuming fluids.</p>
<p>And oftentimes those fluids include not just water,</p>
<p>but caffeine.</p>
<p>And caffeine is a diuretic.</p>
<p>It actually causes the excretion of fluids</p>
<p>from the body in part,</p>
<p>because it causes the excretion of sodium.</p>
<p>All of that to say that if you&rsquo;re somebody who,</p>
<p>for instance, eats your first meal around noon</p>
<p>or one or 2 p.m.</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re fasting for the early part of the day</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re drinking coffee or tea</p>
<p>or ingesting a lot of water,</p>
<p>you are going to be excreting sodium along with that water.</p>
<p>And so many people, including myself,</p>
<p>find that it&rsquo;s useful,</p>
<p>especially when I&rsquo;m drinking caffeine</p>
<p>during that so-called fasting</p>
<p>or non-food intake part of time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m making sure to get enough salt</p>
<p>either in the form of something like Element,</p>
<p>an electrolyte drink,</p>
<p>or putting some sea salt into some water,</p>
<p>or certainly anytime one is ingesting caffeine,</p>
<p>replacing some of the lost water</p>
<p>by increasing one&rsquo;s water intake.</p>
<p>There are some simple rules of thumb around this</p>
<p>that I think can get most people into a place</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re more comfortable and functioning better,</p>
<p>which is for every ounce of coffee or tea that you drink,</p>
<p>I should say caffeinated coffee or tea that you drink,</p>
<p>that you consume one and a half times as much water.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you have an eight-ounce coffee,</p>
<p>try and drink about, you don&rsquo;t have to be exact,</p>
<p>but try and drink about a 12-ounce glass of water,</p>
<p>and you might want to put a tiny bit of sodium into that.</p>
<p>By tiny bit, I just mean a tiny pinch of sodium.</p>
<p>Because remember, even if we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about increasing the amount of sodium intake overall,</p>
<p>the total amount of sodium contained in salt</p>
<p>is sufficiently high that even just a quarter teaspoon</p>
<p>is going to really start to move that number up</p>
<p>towards that range that&rsquo;s still within the safe range.</p>
<p>But if you keep doing that all day long,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re very quickly going to get into</p>
<p>that excessive salt intake range</p>
<p>that is deleterious for health.</p>
<p>So again, if you&rsquo;re consuming more caffeine,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be excreting water and salt and potassium,</p>
<p>and so you&rsquo;re going to have to find ways</p>
<p>to bring water, salt, and potassium back in.</p>
<p>Again, this has to be evaluated</p>
<p>for each of your own individual situations.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re exercising, fasted,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing that after drinking caffeine,</p>
<p>then before, during, and certainly after exercise,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to want to replenish the fluids</p>
<p>and electrolytes that you lost, including sodium.</p>
<p>So you can imagine how this all starts</p>
<p>to become pretty dizzying,</p>
<p>and yet it doesn&rsquo;t have to be dizzying.</p>
<p>We can provide some useful ranges</p>
<p>that for most people will work.</p>
<p>And so let&rsquo;s talk about what those ranges are,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to point you to a resource</p>
<p>that explores what those ranges are</p>
<p>in these various contexts of nutrition, exercise, and so on.</p>
<p>The resource is a book that was authored</p>
<p>by Dr. James D. Nicolantonio.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not a medical doctor.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a scientist, so he&rsquo;s cardiovascular physiology,</p>
<p>as well, I believe, as a doctor of pharmacy.</p>
<p>And the title of the book is The Salt Fix.</p>
<p>The Salt Fix is an interesting read</p>
<p>because it points to, first of all,</p>
<p>the history of salt in society,</p>
<p>and as it relates to health,</p>
<p>it actually emphasizes some of the major missteps,</p>
<p>maybe even pretty drastic errors</p>
<p>that have been made in terms of trying to interpret</p>
<p>the role that salt has in various diseases,</p>
<p>and emphasizes some of the ways in which</p>
<p>perhaps increasing salt</p>
<p>can actually improve health outcomes.</p>
<p>And I think it strikes a pretty nice balance</p>
<p>between what&rsquo;s commonly known about salt</p>
<p>and what I believe ought to be known about salt,</p>
<p>or at least taken into consideration.</p>
<p>You know, the book does provide certain recommendations,</p>
<p>and I actually reached out to the author.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never met him in person or talked to him directly,</p>
<p>and I asked him outright, I said,</p>
<p>how much salt do you recommend people take on average?</p>
<p>And he gave, of course, the appropriate caveats</p>
<p>about prehypertension, hypertension, et cetera,</p>
<p>but made a recommendation which I&rsquo;ll just share with you,</p>
<p>and if you want to learn more</p>
<p>about the support for this recommendation,</p>
<p>you can check out his book.</p>
<p>The recommendation he made was anywhere</p>
<p>from eight to 12 grams of salt a day,</p>
<p>which corresponds to 3.2 to 4.8 grams of sodium.</p>
<p>So going back to the current recommendations</p>
<p>that we talked about before, 2.3 grams of sodium per day,</p>
<p>this is about one and a half times to, you know,</p>
<p>double the amount of sodium that&rsquo;s currently recommended</p>
<p>in most circles, and what this corresponds to</p>
<p>is about one and a half to two teaspoons of salt per day</p>
<p>to arrive at that 3.2 to 4.8 grams of sodium.</p>
<p>Again, this is the recommendation that was passed along</p>
<p>for most people, most conditions,</p>
<p>barring, you know, specific health issues.</p>
<p>Now, what was also interesting is he pointed</p>
<p>to a sodium to potassium ratio,</p>
<p>which is four grams of potassium,</p>
<p>and he also mentioned 400 milligrams of magnesium</p>
<p>and pointed out, and I generally agree here</p>
<p>that many people are deficient in magnesium.</p>
<p>So again, that was a 3.2 to 4.8 grams of sodium,</p>
<p>four grams of potassium.</p>
<p>You might think, well, gosh, that&rsquo;s one and a half</p>
<p>to two times the current recommendation,</p>
<p>but we can go back to that study that was mentioned earlier</p>
<p>in the episode, the 2011 study,</p>
<p>where I described this sort of J-shaped curve</p>
<p>in which when you look at the occurrence</p>
<p>of these negative health events,</p>
<p>they were fairly low at low sodium intake,</p>
<p>lower still at slightly higher sodium intake,</p>
<p>much in line with the recommendations that are made</p>
<p>or that Dr. D. Nicolantonio passed along to me,</p>
<p>and then they increased quite,</p>
<p>those health risks increased quite substantially</p>
<p>as one moves out past, you know,</p>
<p>six grams of sodium, seven grams of sodium per day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when things really do seem to get hazardous</p>
<p>and really, it makes sense, I think,</p>
<p>given the consensus around this</p>
<p>to really avoid very high salt intake.</p>
<p>So the salt fix describes the rationale</p>
<p>behind those recommendations.</p>
<p>The salt fix also describes in quite beautiful detail</p>
<p>the relationship between salt intake, potassium intake,</p>
<p>and the relationship to the sugar consumption system.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to pick up on this idea of the relationship</p>
<p>between salt and sugar,</p>
<p>because I think that one key aspect of the way</p>
<p>that salt can work and can benefit us or can harm us</p>
<p>has to do with the way that sodium and sugar are regulated</p>
<p>and actually perceived by the brain</p>
<p>and how under conditions of certain levels of sodium intake,</p>
<p>we might be inspired to seek more sugar</p>
<p>or to crave sweets more or less.</p>
<p>So up until now, we&rsquo;ve been talking about salt</p>
<p>as a substance and a way to regulate fluid balance</p>
<p>and blood volume and so on.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t talked a lot about salt as a taste</p>
<p>or the taste of things that are salty.</p>
<p>And yet we know that we have salt receptors,</p>
<p>meaning neurons that fire action potentials</p>
<p>when salty substances are detected,</p>
<p>much in the same way that we have sweet detectors</p>
<p>and bitter detectors, and we have detectors of umami,</p>
<p>the savory flavor on our tongue.</p>
<p>And earlier at the beginning of the episode,</p>
<p>I talked about the fact that we have sweet receptors,</p>
<p>neurons that respond to the presence of sugar</p>
<p>or even non-caloric sweet things in the gut.</p>
<p>And that signals up to the brain through the vagus nerve.</p>
<p>And those signals converge on pathways</p>
<p>that relate to dopamine and so on.</p>
<p>Well, we also have salt sensors at various locations</p>
<p>throughout our digestive tract.</p>
<p>Although that the sensation and the taste of salt</p>
<p>actually exerts a very robust effect</p>
<p>on certain areas of the brain</p>
<p>that can either make us crave more or sate,</p>
<p>meaning fulfill our desire for salt.</p>
<p>And you can imagine why this would be important.</p>
<p>Your brain actually has to register</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re bringing in salt</p>
<p>in order to know whether or not</p>
<p>you are going to crave salt more or not.</p>
<p>And beautiful work that&rsquo;s been done by the Zucker Lab,</p>
<p>Z-U-K-E-R, Zucker Lab at Columbia University,</p>
<p>as well as many other labs,</p>
<p>have used imaging techniques and other techniques</p>
<p>such as molecular biology</p>
<p>to define these so-called parallel pathways.</p>
<p>Parallel meaning pathways that represent sweet</p>
<p>or the presence of sweet taste in the mouth and gut.</p>
<p>Parallel pathways meaning neural circuits</p>
<p>that represent the presence of salty tastes</p>
<p>in the mouth and gut and so on.</p>
<p>And that those go into the brain,</p>
<p>move up through brain stem centers</p>
<p>and up to the neocortex,</p>
<p>indeed where our seat of our conscious perception is,</p>
<p>to give us a sense and a perception</p>
<p>of the components of the foods</p>
<p>that we happen to be ingesting</p>
<p>and a sense and a perception of the fluids</p>
<p>and the components of those fluids</p>
<p>that we happen to be ingesting.</p>
<p>Now, parallel pathways, as I&rsquo;m describing them,</p>
<p>are a fundamental feature of every sensory system,</p>
<p>not just the taste system, but also the visual system.</p>
<p>We have parallel pathways for perceiving dark objects</p>
<p>versus light objects,</p>
<p>for perceiving red versus green, et cetera.</p>
<p>This is a fundamental feature of how we are built</p>
<p>and how our nervous system works.</p>
<p>And in the taste system, much like in these other systems,</p>
<p>these pathways are indeed parallel,</p>
<p>but they converge and they can influence one another.</p>
<p>And I think the simplest way to put this</p>
<p>is in the context first of the visual system,</p>
<p>whereby your ability to detect the color red</p>
<p>has everything to do with the fact</p>
<p>that you have neurons in your eye</p>
<p>that absorb long wavelengths of light</p>
<p>that we call reds, red wavelengths of light,</p>
<p>which are longer wavelengths than say blue light,</p>
<p>which is shorter wavelength.</p>
<p>But it is really the comparison of the electrical activity</p>
<p>of the neurons that absorb red light</p>
<p>with the activity of the neurons that absorb green light,</p>
<p>which actually gives you the perception of red.</p>
<p>So that might seem a little counterintuitive,</p>
<p>but indeed it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually because something is red</p>
<p>and has less greenness that we perceive it</p>
<p>as more red than the green.</p>
<p>And this is actually the way</p>
<p>that your entire nervous system works</p>
<p>is that we aren&rsquo;t really good at evaluating absolute levels</p>
<p>of anything in the context of perception.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only by comparison.</p>
<p>And actually there&rsquo;s a fun experiment that you can do.</p>
<p>I think you could probably find it easily online.</p>
<p>You could also do this experiment at home.</p>
<p>You can stare at something that&rsquo;s red or green</p>
<p>for that matter for a while.</p>
<p>So you make an active decision to not blink</p>
<p>and to stare at something that&rsquo;s red.</p>
<p>And then you look away from that thing</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll actually see a green after image</p>
<p>of that red object.</p>
<p>Conversely, if you look at something that&rsquo;s green for a while</p>
<p>and you stare at it and you look away,</p>
<p>you will see the red after image of that thing.</p>
<p>Now the taste system doesn&rsquo;t have quite the same</p>
<p>aftertaste type effect, but nonetheless the pathways,</p>
<p>the parallel pathways for salty</p>
<p>and the parallel pathways for sweet and bitter and so on</p>
<p>can actually interact.</p>
<p>And this has important relevance in the context</p>
<p>of food choices and sugar craving.</p>
<p>One of the things that&rsquo;s common place nowadays</p>
<p>is in many processed foods, there is a business, literally,</p>
<p>a business of putting so-called hidden sugars.</p>
<p>And these hidden sugars are not always</p>
<p>in the form of caloric sugars.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sometimes in the form of artificial sweeteners</p>
<p>into various foods.</p>
<p>And you might say, well, why would they put more sugar</p>
<p>into a food and then disguise the sugary taste</p>
<p>given that sweet tastes often compel people</p>
<p>to eat more of these things?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a way actually of bypassing</p>
<p>some of the homeostatic mechanisms for sweet.</p>
<p>Even though we might think that the more sweet stuff we eat,</p>
<p>the more sweet stuff we crave,</p>
<p>in general, people have a threshold whereby they say,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;ve had enough sugary stuff.</p>
<p>You can actually experience this.</p>
<p>If you ever feel like something is really, really sweet,</p>
<p>take a little sip of water with a little bit of lemon juice</p>
<p>in it or vinegar, and it will quickly quench</p>
<p>that overly sweet sensation or perception.</p>
<p>It will disappear almost immediately.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a practice in fancy meals</p>
<p>of cleansing the palate through the ingestion</p>
<p>of different foods.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the same idea that you&rsquo;re cleansing the palate.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re actually neutralizing the previous taste</p>
<p>so then they can bring yet another dish</p>
<p>to overindulge you in decadence and so forth.</p>
<p>So these sensory systems interact in this way</p>
<p>by putting sugars into foods</p>
<p>and hiding the sugary taste of those foods.</p>
<p>Those foods, even if they contain artificial sweeteners,</p>
<p>can activate the sorts of neurons that we talked about</p>
<p>at the beginning of the episode, like the neuropod cells</p>
<p>that will then signal to the brain to release more dopamine</p>
<p>and make you crave more of that food.</p>
<p>Whereas had you been able to perceive</p>
<p>the true sweetness of that food,</p>
<p>you might&rsquo;ve consumed less.</p>
<p>And indeed, that&rsquo;s what happens.</p>
<p>So these hidden sugars are kind of diabolical.</p>
<p>Why am I talking about all of this</p>
<p>in the context of an episode on salt?</p>
<p>Well, as many of you have probably noticed,</p>
<p>a lot of foods out there contain a salty-sweet combination.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s that combination of salty and sweet,</p>
<p>which can actually lead you to consume more</p>
<p>of the salty-sweet food than you would have</p>
<p>if it had just been sweet or it had just been salty.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because both sweet taste and salty taste</p>
<p>have a homeostatic balance.</p>
<p>So if you ingest something that&rsquo;s very, very salty,</p>
<p>pretty soon your appetite for salty foods will be reduced.</p>
<p>But if you mask some of that with sweet,</p>
<p>well, because of the interactions</p>
<p>of these parallel pathways,</p>
<p>you somewhat shut down your perception</p>
<p>of how much salt you&rsquo;re ingesting.</p>
<p>Or conversely, by ingesting some salt with sweet foods,</p>
<p>you mask some of the sweetness of the sweet foods</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re tasting,</p>
<p>and you will continue to indulge in those foods.</p>
<p>So salty-sweet interactions can be very diabolical.</p>
<p>They can also be very tasty,</p>
<p>but they can be very diabolical</p>
<p>in terms of inspiring you to eat more of a particular food</p>
<p>than you would otherwise if you were just following</p>
<p>your homeostatic salt</p>
<p>or your homeostatic sugar balance systems.</p>
<p>And the beautiful imaging work that&rsquo;s been done</p>
<p>by the Zucker Lab and other labs</p>
<p>has actually been able to reveal</p>
<p>how some of this might work by showing, for instance,</p>
<p>that a certain ensemble,</p>
<p>meaning a certain group of neurons,</p>
<p>is activated by a sweet taste</p>
<p>and a non-overlapping distinct set of neurons just nearby,</p>
<p>sitting cheek to jowl with those other neurons,</p>
<p>would be activated by salty tastes</p>
<p>and yet others by bitter tastes, et cetera.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a separate map</p>
<p>of these different parallel pathways,</p>
<p>but that when foods or fluids are ingested</p>
<p>that are both salty and sweet,</p>
<p>you get a yet entirely different ensemble</p>
<p>of neurons activated.</p>
<p>So your brain, whether or not it&rsquo;s for your visual system</p>
<p>or your auditory system or your taste system,</p>
<p>has a way of representing the pure form of taste,</p>
<p>salty, sweet, bitter, et cetera,</p>
<p>and has a way of representing their combinations.</p>
<p>And food manufacturers have exploited this to a large degree.</p>
<p>I mention all of this</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s looking to explore</p>
<p>either increasing or decreasing your sodium intake</p>
<p>for health benefits, for performance benefits,</p>
<p>in many ways, it is useful to do that</p>
<p>in the context of a fairly pure,</p>
<p>meaning unprocessed food intake background,</p>
<p>whether or not that&rsquo;s keto, carnivore, omnivore,</p>
<p>intermittent fasting or what have you,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>But the closer that foods are to their basic form and taste,</p>
<p>meaning not large combinations</p>
<p>of large amounts of ingredients</p>
<p>and certainly avoiding highly processed foods,</p>
<p>the more quickly you&rsquo;re going to be able to hone in</p>
<p>on your specific salt appetite and salt needs,</p>
<p>which as I&rsquo;ve pointed out numerous times</p>
<p>throughout this episode</p>
<p>are going to vary from person to person,</p>
<p>depending on nutrition, depending on activity,</p>
<p>depending on hormone status</p>
<p>or even portion of your menstrual cycle for that matter.</p>
<p>So if you want to hone in</p>
<p>on the appropriate amount of sodium for you,</p>
<p>yes, blood pressure is going to be an important metric</p>
<p>to pay attention to as you go along.</p>
<p>And the parameters for healthy blood pressure ranges</p>
<p>are readily available online.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll let you refer to those</p>
<p>in order to determine those for yourself.</p>
<p>But in determining whether or not</p>
<p>increasing your salt intake might be beneficial</p>
<p>for instance, for reducing anxiety a bit</p>
<p>or for increasing blood pressure</p>
<p>to offset some of these postural syndromes</p>
<p>where you get dizzy, et cetera,</p>
<p>for improving sports performance or cognitive performance,</p>
<p>I can only recommend that you do this</p>
<p>in a fairly clean context</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re not trying to do this</p>
<p>by ingesting a bunch of salty foods</p>
<p>or salty sweet foods, et cetera.</p>
<p>And indeed many people find, and it&rsquo;s reviewed a bit</p>
<p>and some of the data are reviewed in the book,</p>
<p>the salt fix, that when people increase their salt intake</p>
<p>in a backdrop of relatively unprocessed foods</p>
<p>that sugar cravings can indeed be vastly reduced.</p>
<p>And that makes sense given the way</p>
<p>that these neural pathways for salty and sweet interact.</p>
<p>Now thus far, I&rsquo;ve already covered quite a lot of material</p>
<p>but I would be completely remiss</p>
<p>if I didn&rsquo;t emphasize the crucial role</p>
<p>that sodium plays in the way that neurons function.</p>
<p>In fact, sodium is one of the key elements</p>
<p>that allows neurons to function at all.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s by way of engaging</p>
<p>what we call the action potential.</p>
<p>The action potential is the firing</p>
<p>of electrical activity by neurons.</p>
<p>Neurons can engage electrical activity</p>
<p>in a number of different ways.</p>
<p>They have graded potentials, they have gap junctions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole landscape</p>
<p>of different electrophysiologies of neurons</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t want to go into just yet.</p>
<p>At least not in this episode.</p>
<p>But the action potential is the fundamental way</p>
<p>in which neurons communicate with one another.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sometimes called spikes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just kind of nomenclature that neuroscientists use.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to briefly describe the action potential</p>
<p>and the role that sodium plays.</p>
<p>And this will involve a little bit of chemistry</p>
<p>but I promise it will be accessible to anyone</p>
<p>even if you don&rsquo;t have a chemistry or a physics background</p>
<p>or electrophysiology background.</p>
<p>Neurons have an inside and an outside</p>
<p>and inside are things like your genetic material.</p>
<p>They have a bunch of things floating around in there</p>
<p>that allow those cells to function.</p>
<p>And they tend to have this wire extending out of them.</p>
<p>Sometimes a very long wire,</p>
<p>sometimes a short one that we call the axon.</p>
<p>And at the end of that wire, that axon,</p>
<p>they release little packets of chemicals</p>
<p>that either cause the next neuron to fire action potentials</p>
<p>or prevent the next neuron from firing action potential.</p>
<p>So they kind of vomit out these little packets of chemicals</p>
<p>that either inspire or suppress action potentials</p>
<p>in other neurons.</p>
<p>The way that that whole process occurs</p>
<p>is that a given neuron needs to</p>
<p>change its electrical activity.</p>
<p>So normally neurons are hanging out</p>
<p>and they have what we call a negative charge.</p>
<p>And the reason they have a negative charge</p>
<p>is that the inside of the cell</p>
<p>has things floating around in it</p>
<p>like potassium, a little bit of sodium,</p>
<p>and some stuff like chloride.</p>
<p>These are literally just,</p>
<p>just imagine these as little balls of stuff.</p>
<p>And if they have a negative charge on them,</p>
<p>then the inside of the cell</p>
<p>is going to tend to be more negative.</p>
<p>And outside of the cell, it turns out,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have a bunch of stuff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s positively charged.</p>
<p>And one of the main factors</p>
<p>in creating that positive charge is sodium.</p>
<p>Sodium carries a positive charge.</p>
<p>So you have neurons that you can just imagine,</p>
<p>for sake of this discussion,</p>
<p>you can just imagine as a sphere</p>
<p>with a little wire sticking out of it.</p>
<p>They, you can put a little minus on the inside for negative.</p>
<p>You can put a little plus on the outside for positive.</p>
<p>And when that neuron is stimulated by another neuron,</p>
<p>if the stimulation, the electrical stimulation,</p>
<p>is sufficiently high,</p>
<p>meaning enough little packets of neurotransmitter</p>
<p>have been vomited onto its surface</p>
<p>at sufficient concentration,</p>
<p>what happens is little pores, little spaces,</p>
<p>little gaps open up in the membrane of that cell</p>
<p>that separates the inside from the outside.</p>
<p>And because it&rsquo;s positive,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of positive charge outside</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of negative inside.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a boulder running downhill.</p>
<p>All this stuff tends to rush downhill.</p>
<p>It tries to create even amounts of charge.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s negative on the inside, positive on the outside.</p>
<p>And what happens is sodium rushes into the cell,</p>
<p>carrying a lot of charge into the cell.</p>
<p>And as a consequence, the charge of that cell</p>
<p>goes from negative, actually very negative,</p>
<p>to quite positive.</p>
<p>And if it hits a certain threshold of positive charge</p>
<p>because of all the sodium ions going into the cell,</p>
<p>then it fires what&rsquo;s called an action potential.</p>
<p>And it vomits out its own set of chemicals</p>
<p>onto the next neuron.</p>
<p>And so it sets off a chain of,</p>
<p>one neuron goes from negative to positive,</p>
<p>vomits out chemicals onto the next one.</p>
<p>The next one, the next neuron that binds to receptors</p>
<p>or enters the cell,</p>
<p>and that cell goes from negative to positive charge,</p>
<p>vomits its contents onto the next cell,</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Sodium rushing into the cell, therefore,</p>
<p>is the way that the action potential is stimulated.</p>
<p>In other words, sodium is the way</p>
<p>that neurons communicate with one another.</p>
<p>Now, the neurons don&rsquo;t stay in a positive charge.</p>
<p>Otherwise they would just keep vomiting out their contents.</p>
<p>Blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>But they need to maintain some of that,</p>
<p>and they need to go back to preparing to do it</p>
<p>the next time and the next time by resting a bit.</p>
<p>And it turns out that the way they restore their charge</p>
<p>is by pushing that sodium back out of the cell.</p>
<p>There are mechanisms in place to do that,</p>
<p>things like the so-called sodium-potassium pump.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a change in the levels of potassium</p>
<p>across the cell membrane, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>If you want to look at a demonstration of this,</p>
<p>you can put into a web browser the action potential.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find some beautiful descriptions there</p>
<p>on YouTube and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Maybe sometime on Instagram,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do a description with a diagram,</p>
<p>because I realize a number of people</p>
<p>are just listening to this.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t do that here.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t do that here,</p>
<p>because I want everyone to be able</p>
<p>to get the same amount of material,</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not they&rsquo;re watching</p>
<p>and or listening to this.</p>
<p>But the point I&rsquo;d like to make,</p>
<p>at least as it relates to this episode on salt,</p>
<p>is that having sufficient levels of salt in your system</p>
<p>allows your brain to function,</p>
<p>allows your nervous system to function at all.</p>
<p>Again, this is the most basic aspect</p>
<p>of nervous system function.</p>
<p>And there are cases where this whole system gets disrupted.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the topic of sodium and water balance.</p>
<p>As many of you have probably heard,</p>
<p>but hopefully if you haven&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll take this message seriously.</p>
<p>If you drink too much water,</p>
<p>especially in a short amount of time,</p>
<p>you can actually kill yourself, right?</p>
<p>And we certainly don&rsquo;t want that to happen.</p>
<p>If you ingest a lot of water in a very short period of time,</p>
<p>something called hypernatremia,</p>
<p>you will excrete a lot of sodium very quickly</p>
<p>and your ability to regulate kidney function</p>
<p>will be disrupted.</p>
<p>But in addition to that,</p>
<p>your brain can actually stop functioning.</p>
<p>So people have actually consumed water to excess,</p>
<p>especially after sports events and so forth.</p>
<p>And if that water doesn&rsquo;t contain sufficient electrolytes,</p>
<p>you can actually shut down neurons ability</p>
<p>to function at all by disrupting this balance</p>
<p>of sodium and potassium</p>
<p>and the amount of extracellular sodium</p>
<p>and neurons ability to signal to one another</p>
<p>through action potentials.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t emphasize the importance</p>
<p>of action potentials enough.</p>
<p>They are the way that I can lift my pen right now.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the way that I can speak.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the way that you breathe.</p>
<p>They literally control all aspects</p>
<p>of your nervous system function.</p>
<p>Now it takes quite a lot of water intake</p>
<p>before you excrete enough sodium</p>
<p>that your nervous system is going to shut down.</p>
<p>And I certainly don&rsquo;t want to give the impression</p>
<p>that simply by ingesting more sodium,</p>
<p>your neurons will work better.</p>
<p>But it absolutely is the case</p>
<p>that if you don&rsquo;t ingest enough sodium,</p>
<p>that your neurons won&rsquo;t function as well as they could.</p>
<p>And that if your sodium levels are made too low</p>
<p>by hemorrhage or by ingesting so much water fluid</p>
<p>that you excrete excess amounts of sodium</p>
<p>or through any other mechanism that is,</p>
<p>then indeed your neurons won&rsquo;t be able</p>
<p>to fire action potentials</p>
<p>and your brain and nervous system simply won&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the primary reasons</p>
<p>why dehydration leads to confusion</p>
<p>and dizziness and lack of coordination.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve talked about this a bit</p>
<p>in the episode on endurance,</p>
<p>but there are instances in which, you know,</p>
<p>competitive athletes have come into the stadium</p>
<p>to finish a final lap of a long endurance race</p>
<p>and are completely disoriented</p>
<p>and actually can&rsquo;t find their way to the finish line.</p>
<p>You know, it might sound like kind of a silly,</p>
<p>kind of crazy example,</p>
<p>but there are examples of people having severe mental issues</p>
<p>and physical issues post exercise</p>
<p>when that exercise involved a ton of sweating</p>
<p>or hot environments or insufficient ingestion of fluids</p>
<p>and electrolytes,</p>
<p>because included in that electrolyte formula,</p>
<p>of course, is sodium.</p>
<p>And as you just learned,</p>
<p>sodium is absolutely crucial for neurons to function.</p>
<p>So to briefly recap some of what I&rsquo;ve talked about today,</p>
<p>we talked about how the brain monitors</p>
<p>the amount of salt in your brain and body</p>
<p>and how that relates to thirst</p>
<p>and the drive to consume more fluid and or salty fluids.</p>
<p>We also talked a little bit about the hormones</p>
<p>that come from the brain</p>
<p>and operate at the level of the kidney</p>
<p>in order to either retain</p>
<p>or allow water to leave your system.</p>
<p>Talked a little bit about the function of the kidney itself,</p>
<p>a beautiful organ.</p>
<p>We talked about the relationship between salt intake</p>
<p>and various health parameters</p>
<p>and how a particular range of salt intake might be optimal,</p>
<p>depending on the context</p>
<p>in which that range is being consumed.</p>
<p>Meaning, depending on whether or not you&rsquo;re hypertensive,</p>
<p>prehypertensive or normal tension.</p>
<p>We talked about fluid intake and electrolyte intake.</p>
<p>So sodium, potassium and magnesium</p>
<p>in the context of athletic or sports performance,</p>
<p>but also in terms of maintaining cognitive function.</p>
<p>Talked about the Galpin equation,</p>
<p>which you could easily adapt to your body weight</p>
<p>and to your circumstances.</p>
<p>Of course, adjusting the amount of fluid</p>
<p>and electrolyte intake upwards,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re exercising or working in very hot environments.</p>
<p>Downwards, maybe if you&rsquo;re in less hot environments</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re sweating less and so on.</p>
<p>We also talked about the relationship</p>
<p>between the stress system and the salt craving system</p>
<p>and why those two systems interact</p>
<p>and why for some people who may suffer a bit from anxiety</p>
<p>or under conditions of stress,</p>
<p>increasing salt intake,</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s done through healthy means,</p>
<p>might actually be beneficial.</p>
<p>We also talked about conditions</p>
<p>in which increasing salt intake might be beneficial</p>
<p>for offsetting low blood pressure</p>
<p>and some of these postural syndromes</p>
<p>that can lead people to dizziness and so forth.</p>
<p>These are things that have to be explored</p>
<p>on an individual basis.</p>
<p>And of course, have to be explored</p>
<p>with the support of your doctor.</p>
<p>I mentioned the salt fix,</p>
<p>which I think is an interesting read,</p>
<p>keeping in mind that a lot of the information in there</p>
<p>runs counter to the typical narrative</p>
<p>that you hear around salt,</p>
<p>but nonetheless has some very interesting points</p>
<p>that you might want to consider</p>
<p>and certainly will broaden your view of the history of</p>
<p>and the applications of salt</p>
<p>as it relates to a great number</p>
<p>of health and performance metrics.</p>
<p>We also talked about the perception of salt,</p>
<p>meaning the perception of salty tastes</p>
<p>and how the perception of salty tastes</p>
<p>and the perception of other tastes like sweet</p>
<p>can interact with one another</p>
<p>to drive things like increased sugar intake</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re not even aware of it.</p>
<p>And indeed, how the combination of salty and sweet tastes</p>
<p>can bias you towards craving more,</p>
<p>for instance, processed foods</p>
<p>and why that might be a good thing to avoid.</p>
<p>And of course, we talked about salt</p>
<p>and its critical role in the action potential,</p>
<p>the fundamental way in which the nervous system</p>
<p>functions at all.</p>
<p>So my hope for you in listening to this episode</p>
<p>is that you consider a question.</p>
<p>And that question is, what salt intake is best for you?</p>
<p>And that you place that question</p>
<p>in the context of your fluid intake.</p>
<p>You place that in the context of the diet you&rsquo;re following,</p>
<p>the amount of caffeine you might be ingesting</p>
<p>and the diuretic effects of caffeine.</p>
<p>And crucially, that you place that in the context</p>
<p>of the electrolytes more generally,</p>
<p>meaning sodium, potassium, and magnesium.</p>
<p>Someday there will be an online program or an app,</p>
<p>I imagine, where one could put</p>
<p>a bunch of different parameters in about,</p>
<p>their particular health status, their particular diet,</p>
<p>their particular exercise, et cetera.</p>
<p>Maybe it would all be run by AI algorithm or something</p>
<p>where it would monitor all of that for us.</p>
<p>And then it would spit out for us a precise amount</p>
<p>of sodium that we should take in each day.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no such tool or device exists right now.</p>
<p>And so all of us have to figure out</p>
<p>the appropriate amount of sodium intake for ourselves.</p>
<p>And that has to be done</p>
<p>under these contextual considerations.</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>Maybe one of you will design such an app or such a device.</p>
<p>I think it would be very useful.</p>
<p>If nothing else, today&rsquo;s discussion ought to</p>
<p>illuminate the fact that some strict recommendation</p>
<p>of salt intake cannot be made universally</p>
<p>across the board for everybody.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just simply no way that could be done.</p>
<p>And yet, I think most of what we&rsquo;ve learned about salt</p>
<p>in the general discussions around health</p>
<p>are that it&rsquo;s this evil substance.</p>
<p>Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredible substance.</p>
<p>Our physiology is dependent on it.</p>
<p>Our cognition is dependent on it.</p>
<p>Indeed, our mental and physical health</p>
<p>and our performance in essentially all aspects of life</p>
<p>is dependent on it.</p>
<p>And I hope I&rsquo;ve been able to illuminate</p>
<p>some of the beautiful ways in which the brain</p>
<p>and the bodily organs interact</p>
<p>in order to help us regulate this thing</p>
<p>that we call sodium balance.</p>
<p>And the fact that we have neurons in our brain</p>
<p>that are both tuned to the levels of salt in our body</p>
<p>and positioned in a location in the brain</p>
<p>that allows them to detect the levels of salt in our body</p>
<p>and to drive the intake of more or less salt</p>
<p>and more or less fluid and other electrolytes</p>
<p>really just points to the beauty of the system</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve all evolved</p>
<p>that allows us to interact with our environment</p>
<p>and make adjustments according to the context</p>
<p>of our daily and ongoing life.</p>
