important things when you&amp;rsquo;re on a ketogenic diet is to really understand how to read a label and to read labels on a regular basis because if you&amp;rsquo;re not there&amp;rsquo;s all sorts of hidden carbs that can creep into this so i wanted to give you some basics on what you should look at on a label the most important things so you&amp;rsquo;ll see this little thing on the back called nutritional facts there&amp;rsquo;s two things at the top it says serving size and servings per container or per unit so let&amp;rsquo;s say for example you&amp;rsquo;re buying chocolate of course the only chocolate you should be buying would be the keto friendly but let&amp;rsquo;s say for example it&amp;rsquo;s just a chocolate bar and let&amp;rsquo;s say the serving size is one of those little cubes right those little tiny cubes and there&amp;rsquo;s 12 of those cubes in a whole bar so this entire label as far as the carbohydrates and the sugars and the proteins and the fats are based on the serving size not the servings for the entire container or the entire chocolate bar and the reason i&amp;rsquo;m bringing that up is because if you&amp;rsquo;re eating more than one serving size which most people do let&amp;rsquo;s say you ate the whole chocolate bar you have to multiply 12 times the number of sugars to really see how much sugar or multiplied by the carbohydrates to see how much carbohydrate you&amp;rsquo;re getting and you&amp;rsquo;re going to find out it&amp;rsquo;s a massive amount okay so just pay attention to that all right so then you have the total carbs which is very important and then you have the fiber you minus the fiber and you get the net carbs okay so why because even though fiber is a carbohydrate it doesn&amp;rsquo;t increase insulin it doesn&amp;rsquo;t get digested by you it gets digested by your microbes in your gut but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t spike insulin and then you get to sugars right we want to keep those as low as possible so when i read a label i&amp;rsquo;m focusing on carbs fiber and sugar now the next point is very important when you do keto you should have a net carb of between 20 and 50 grams of carbs you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have more than 50 grams right but what&amp;rsquo;s also very very important is the type of carbs the quality of carbohydrate because if you&amp;rsquo;re getting your carbohydrates from pure sugar or high fructose corn syrup or something that&amp;rsquo;s high in the glycemic index then that is going to make it a lot less keto friendly and so we have the limit of carbs and then we have the type of carbs we want low glycemic carbohydrates when you&amp;rsquo;re doing dirty keto for example you&amp;rsquo;re not really looking at the ingredients so i don&amp;rsquo;t recommend doing dirty keto so even though that like a substance called maltodextrin might be in the ingredients and they might say it&amp;rsquo;s keto friendly because they&amp;rsquo;re saying it&amp;rsquo;s well it&amp;rsquo;s just small amounts yeah but on a glycemic index it&amp;rsquo;s higher than glucose it&amp;rsquo;s like one of the highest glycemic substances i wouldn&amp;rsquo;t call it a food ever okay so it&amp;rsquo;s very very high so it&amp;rsquo;s going to create more problems with your blood sugar then we have other ones like dextrose which is a synthetic sugar which you want to avoid and then we have other things that are i consider not very high in the on the quality list of healthy corn fiber okay is it is it gmo does it have residues of glyphosate how is it processed not excited about corn fiber tapioca not excited about that one and then some products even keto friendly breads have wheat in there now why would you put wheat in there that&amp;rsquo;s that&amp;rsquo;s not keto friendly or they might have gluten which is the protein in the wheat which a lot of people have allergies to in sensitivities to or they&amp;rsquo;re intolerant as in gluten intolerance okay so it&amp;rsquo;s a little bit different than analogy but they can rip up their stomach so you don&amp;rsquo;t want to use wheat or gluten and any products that you consume and even some keto products have sugar in them which is kind of crazy so when it says keto friendly read the ingredients and you&amp;rsquo;ll find that a lot of times it&amp;rsquo;s not really keto friendly it may fit within the certain carbohydrate amounts but they&amp;rsquo;re not the type of carbohydrates that you want to be putting in your body now moving right along when you get to the ingredients at the bottom part usually the first ingredient is the majority of the product and this is interesting when you buy multivitamins if it has calcium carbonate as the first ingredient then you know the majority of that product is calcium carbonate and that&amp;rsquo;s limestone and it&amp;rsquo;s like a rock first of all it&amp;rsquo;s not very well digested in your body you don&amp;rsquo;t really absorb it too well and they&amp;rsquo;re basically selling you a bunch of vitamins as a paperweight because it&amp;rsquo;s just basically a rock with some other synthetic vitamins and minerals and they&amp;rsquo;re making a tremendous a profit yet the quality is terrible and so a lot of other products their first ingredient is soy and so then you know the other ingredients in addition to that soy are just small amounts and i&amp;rsquo;m talking about salad dressings and mayonnaise i mean they&amp;rsquo;re basically just soy oil products now sometimes we&amp;rsquo;ll say it&amp;rsquo;s organic soy but it&amp;rsquo;s still soy it&amp;rsquo;s estrogenic so i recommend you don&amp;rsquo;t consume any soy sometimes they&amp;rsquo;ll say your salad dressing is made with olive oil right and then you look at the back label and it says it has soy with the olive oil so you want salad dressing just with olive oil without any soy another little thing they&amp;rsquo;ll do is they&amp;rsquo;ll instead of putting msg or monosodium glutamate they&amp;rsquo;ll put modified food starch okay modified food starch is msg and then the other thing they might put is they might put a certain oil they may even say olive oil and then in parentheses or soy canola coconut safflower or cottonseed oil so now they have an option to use whatever oil that they want and so you probably could have guessed that they&amp;rsquo;re going to use the cheapest one they can find so just be aware of that so i always read labels and it&amp;rsquo;s amazing how people are surprised after they buy the product and they&amp;rsquo;re like oh my gosh now i got to shoot this out so read labels always"><title>Stop Being Tricked Reading Food Labels ｜ DrEricBergDC |

a ketogenic diet is to really understand how to  </p><p>read a label and to read labels on a regular basis 
because if you&rsquo;re not there&rsquo;s all sorts of hidden  </p><p>carbs that can creep into this so i wanted to 
give you some basics on what you should look at  </p><p>on a label the most important things so 
you&rsquo;ll see this little thing on the back  </p><p>called nutritional facts there&rsquo;s two 
things at the top it says serving size  </p><p>and servings per container or per unit so let&rsquo;s 
say for example you&rsquo;re buying chocolate of course  </p><p>the only chocolate you should be buying 
would be the keto friendly but let&rsquo;s say  </p><p>for example it&rsquo;s just a chocolate bar and let&rsquo;s 
say the serving size is one of those little  </p><p>cubes right those little tiny cubes and 
there&rsquo;s 12 of those cubes in a whole bar so  </p><p>this entire label as far as the carbohydrates 
and the sugars and the proteins and the fats  </p><p>are based on the serving size not the servings for 
the entire container or the entire chocolate bar  </p><p>and the reason i&rsquo;m bringing that up is because 
if you&rsquo;re eating more than one serving size  </p><p>which most people do let&rsquo;s say you ate the whole 
chocolate bar you have to multiply 12 times  </p><p>the number of sugars to really see how much 
sugar or multiplied by the carbohydrates to see  </p><p>how much carbohydrate you&rsquo;re getting and you&rsquo;re 
going to find out it&rsquo;s a massive amount okay so  </p><p>just pay attention to that all right so then you 
have the total carbs which is very important and  </p><p>then you have the fiber you minus the fiber 
and you get the net carbs okay so why because  </p><p>even though fiber is a carbohydrate it doesn&rsquo;t 
increase insulin it doesn&rsquo;t get digested by you  </p><p>it gets digested by your microbes in your gut 
but it doesn&rsquo;t spike insulin and then you get  </p><p>to sugars right we want to keep those as low as 
possible so when i read a label i&rsquo;m focusing on  </p><p>carbs fiber and sugar now the next point is very 
important when you do keto you should have a  </p><p>net carb of between 20 and 50 grams of carbs 
you shouldn&rsquo;t have more than 50 grams right  </p><p>but what&rsquo;s also very very important is the 
type of carbs the quality of carbohydrate  </p><p>because if you&rsquo;re getting your carbohydrates 
from pure sugar or high fructose corn syrup or  </p><p>something that&rsquo;s high in the glycemic index 
then that is going to make it a lot less  </p><p>keto friendly and so we have the limit of carbs 
and then we have the type of carbs we want low  </p><p>glycemic carbohydrates when you&rsquo;re doing dirty 
keto for example you&rsquo;re not really looking at  </p><p>the ingredients so i don&rsquo;t recommend doing dirty 
keto so even though that like a substance called  </p><p>maltodextrin might be in the ingredients and 
they might say it&rsquo;s keto friendly because  </p><p>they&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s well it&rsquo;s just small 
amounts yeah but on a glycemic index it&rsquo;s  </p><p>higher than glucose it&rsquo;s like one of the highest 
glycemic substances i wouldn&rsquo;t call it a food  </p><p>ever okay so it&rsquo;s very very high so it&rsquo;s going 
to create more problems with your blood sugar  </p><p>then we have other ones like dextrose which 
is a synthetic sugar which you want to avoid  </p><p>and then we have other things that are i consider 
not very high in the on the quality list of  </p><p>healthy corn fiber okay is it is it gmo does it 
have residues of glyphosate how is it processed  </p><p>not excited about corn fiber tapioca not excited 
about that one and then some products even  </p><p>keto friendly breads have wheat in there now 
why would you put wheat in there that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s  </p><p>not keto friendly or they might have gluten which 
is the protein in the wheat which a lot of people  </p><p>have allergies to in sensitivities to or they&rsquo;re 
intolerant as in gluten intolerance okay so it&rsquo;s  </p><p>a little bit different than analogy but they can 
rip up their stomach so you don&rsquo;t want to use  </p><p>wheat or gluten and any products that you consume 
and even some keto products have sugar in them  </p><p>which is kind of crazy so when it says keto 
friendly read the ingredients and you&rsquo;ll find  </p><p>that a lot of times it&rsquo;s not really keto friendly 
it may fit within the certain carbohydrate amounts  </p><p>but they&rsquo;re not the type of carbohydrates 
that you want to be putting in your body  </p><p>now moving right along when you get 
to the ingredients at the bottom part  </p><p>usually the first ingredient is the majority of 
the product and this is interesting when you buy  </p><p>multivitamins if it has calcium carbonate as the 
first ingredient then you know the majority of  </p><p>that product is calcium carbonate and that&rsquo;s 
limestone and it&rsquo;s like a rock first of all  </p><p>it&rsquo;s not very well digested in your body you 
don&rsquo;t really absorb it too well and they&rsquo;re  </p><p>basically selling you a bunch of vitamins 
as a paperweight because it&rsquo;s just basically  </p><p>a rock with some other synthetic vitamins and 
minerals and they&rsquo;re making a tremendous a profit  </p><p>yet the quality is terrible and so a lot 
of other products their first ingredient is  </p><p>soy and so then you know the other ingredients in 
addition to that soy are just small amounts and  </p><p>i&rsquo;m talking about salad dressings and mayonnaise 
i mean they&rsquo;re basically just soy oil products  </p><p>now sometimes we&rsquo;ll say it&rsquo;s organic soy but 
it&rsquo;s still soy it&rsquo;s estrogenic so i recommend  </p><p>you don&rsquo;t consume any soy sometimes they&rsquo;ll say 
your salad dressing is made with olive oil right  </p><p>and then you look at the back label and 
it says it has soy with the olive oil so  </p><p>you want salad dressing just with olive 
oil without any soy another little thing  </p><p>they&rsquo;ll do is they&rsquo;ll instead of putting msg 
or monosodium glutamate they&rsquo;ll put modified  </p><p>food starch okay modified food starch is msg and 
then the other thing they might put is they might  </p><p>put a certain oil they may even say olive oil 
and then in parentheses or soy canola coconut  </p><p>safflower or cottonseed oil so now they have an 
option to use whatever oil that they want and so  </p><p>you probably could have guessed that they&rsquo;re 
going to use the cheapest one they can find  </p><p>so just be aware of that so i always read labels 
and it&rsquo;s amazing how people are surprised after  </p><p>they buy the product and they&rsquo;re like oh my gosh 
now i got to shoot this out so read labels always</p><p>hey before you go real quick i have a course 
entitled how to bulletproof your immune system  </p><p>it&rsquo;s a free course i want you to take it and 
here&rsquo;s why here&rsquo;s you here is your environment</p><p>everyone is focused on this over here 
avoiding your environment but what about here  </p><p>what about strengthening your immune system
