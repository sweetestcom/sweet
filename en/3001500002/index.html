    <p>[Music]</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling over there</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>please welcome president digital experience Anil chakravarthy</p>
<p>[Music] morning everybody good morning hope</p>
<p>everybody is doing great and welcome to day two of Summer it&rsquo;s great to have all</p>
<p>of you back and I really hope yesterday I left you inspired about the</p>
<p>opportunity in front of all of us when it comes to driving growth from</p>
<p>experiences I&rsquo;m really truly excited by The</p>
<p>Innovation we discussed around the Adobe experience cloud and how we will really</p>
<p>power experience LED growth over the next few years working with all of you</p>
<p>we also heard some great examples yesterday of what this looks like from</p>
<p>forward-thinking leaders how they differentiate their brands how they</p>
<p>build trust and loyalty with their customers and how they maximize their</p>
<p>business outcomes by really meeting their own customers where they are</p>
<p>we heard from Eli Lilly we heard from T-Mobile we heard from Prudential</p>
<p>Financial and I&rsquo;m sure in the Innovation super sessions you had the opportunity</p>
<p>to listen to a lot more of your peers and your customers a huge round of</p>
<p>thanks to all of them for doing this I really appreciate it</p>
<p>[Applause] we&rsquo;ll shine a light on leaders in other</p>
<p>fields their Journeys their lessons are equally instructive to us as we look</p>
<p>forward and take out think about the next few years ahead in this Dynamic</p>
<p>environment but before we dive into those sessions</p>
<p>we want to just dive deeper into generative AI yesterday our</p>
<p>announcements in generative AI generated a lot of Buzz and today we want to go</p>
<p>deeper and talk about generative AI when when we talked about generative AIS</p>
<p>today we said look along with data and with content we know that Ai and</p>
<p>generative AI is foundational for achieving experience-led growth</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll reshape every aspect of what marketers do and creatives do in</p>
<p>marketing we ighing Banning execution analysis it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not just marketing content that&rsquo;s a big piece of it but Journeys audiences</p>
<p>campaigns experiences generative AI has the potential to</p>
<p>transform every aspect of marketing so now at Adobe we have a decade plus</p>
<p>track record of pioneering AI Innovation we call it Adobe Sensei and here&rsquo;s you</p>
<p>know some of the features that we have done hundreds of features introduced</p>
<p>across our products delivered to you by the products and applications of the</p>
<p>Adobe experience cloud each of them focused on helping you work</p>
<p>and collaborate and transform what you do in new ways</p>
<p>we see generative AI as the next Natural Evolution of what we have been doing</p>
<p>with sensei we made significant announcements Summit</p>
<p>just to recap a few of those we talked about fireflys today with uh Adobe</p>
<p>Creative Cloud David introduced Firefly we also talked about the Sensei</p>
<p>generative AI services in the Adobe experience cloud</p>
<p>including our comprehensive Vision to really help you build the co-pilot for</p>
<p>you as marketers and creatives to increase your productivity to amplify</p>
<p>what you do from the first Spark of creativity all the way through your</p>
<p>customer Journey and we are putting it to work across all</p>
<p>of our clouds today</p>
<p>question the power the speed the ease to generate high quality images and</p>
<p>stunning text effects we saw a lot of those visuals yesterday</p>
<p>and which is safe for commercial use the new Sensei Jane AI services that are</p>
<p>natively integrated in the experienced cloud and into the workflows that are in</p>
<p>the applications that you always already already use today</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s marketing copy generation conversational experiences audience and</p>
<p>journey creation caption generation these were some of the services that we</p>
<p>announced that are already going to be available in the next couple of quarters</p>
<p>but that is the framework for the next few years</p>
<p>so what we want to do today is really go into how we&rsquo;re going to do</p>
<p>this but I wanted to put it in the framework of what we call our AI ethics</p>
<p>how do we responsibly bring AI to you so that when you use our AI Sensei AI</p>
<p>generative AI built into our applications built into our workflows it</p>
<p>really reflects the trust and data governance and the overall principles</p>
<p>that that adobe carries so there are three key areas we focus on</p>
<p>we call it accountability responsibility and transparency art the art of AI</p>
<p>ethics and let me touch on each one of them</p>
<p>with accountability we are committed to taking ownership of the impact of our</p>
<p>work by having processes in place and making sure that there are resources</p>
<p>dedicated to receiving and responding to your feedback or concerns and feedback</p>
<p>and concerns from your customers ultimately we are committed to advancing</p>
<p>AI in an ethical responsible and inclusive manner</p>
<p>with responsibility we will be responsible during every</p>
<p>phase of Designing developing deploying and maintaining our AI systems through</p>
<p>thoughtful evaluation and careful due diligence you&rsquo;ll see that as you go</p>
<p>through any of our sessions as you go through all of these demos</p>
<p>and we are committed to making these experiences with adobe&rsquo;s AI productive</p>
<p>and efficient for you with control and trusted governance capabilities in the</p>
<p>hands of marketers and creatives</p>
<p>finally transparency we are committed to being open about how</p>
<p>we use AI we talked yesterday during the announcement about how we have built it</p>
<p>to be commercially safe and we want to bring our customers into the journey</p>
<p>that was the idea of opening this up with beta and really work with you our</p>
<p>community to design and Implement AI that respects our customers preferences</p>
<p>and your interests and this is exactly how we view the future of generative AI</p>
<p>when it comes to the entire marketing process</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m excited for us to give you a deeper look at all of that so what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to do now is to turn it over to Gina Casa Grande for a great demo of the</p>
<p>potential of where this could go for marketers over the next couple of years</p>
<p>Gina take it away</p>
<p>thanks annel</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to share the future of adobe experience Cloud where Adobe Sensei gen</p>
<p>AI is integrated into each stage of the customer experience workflow</p>
<p>actionable insights audiences content campaigns and Journeys are all</p>
<p>automatically generated helping teams to deliver personalized experiences I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to share this through the lens of a travel and hospitality company let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>get started Adobe Sensei gen AI identifies and</p>
<p>alerts the team to a new travel Trend it&rsquo;s always on sifting through mounds of</p>
<p>internal and external data and it&rsquo;s trained on the context of the company&rsquo;s</p>
<p>industry it surfaces relevant Trends and insights</p>
<p>in the experience Cloud as they become predictive</p>
<p>this trend summary indicates that one of the core audiences is beginning to take</p>
<p>more trips alone and these data stories are automatically created by Sensei gen</p>
<p>AI detailing insights around the audience</p>
<p>and making the data easy to understand the marketer is guided along as they ask</p>
<p>how they can best leverage this emerging trend</p>
<p>Sensei gen AI is like a co-pilot highlighting opportunities that drive</p>
<p>more bookings acquire new customers and even guides product decisions based on</p>
<p>usage the factors driving these predictions</p>
<p>take into account the company&rsquo;s context and key business goals</p>
<p>and once a selection is made a new campaign plan is generated it</p>
<p>leverages the breadth of adobe experience Cloud end to end turning</p>
<p>insights into action</p>
<p>this bird&rsquo;s eye campaign view is created in the moment along with the content and</p>
<p>journey opportunities for this audience it includes a tagline and a look at the</p>
<p>interconnected programs for the booking on trip and post-trip experiences</p>
<p>Sensei gen AI provides a inspirational foundation for the marketing and</p>
<p>creative teams and it accelerates the overall campaign</p>
<p>process going from months to minutes the marketer is guided has a great start</p>
<p>and wants to explore what other audiences travel solo</p>
<p>in response they see these overlapping audiences and digging deeper they want</p>
<p>to understand How likely they are to book</p>
<p>and the data is right at their fingertips so they can make an informed</p>
<p>decision quickly wanting to extend their uh their</p>
<p>marketing reach with these audiences they make these selections and generate</p>
<p>a new plan now all of this is happening on the fly</p>
<p>with AI a newly generated campaign plan</p>
<p>content and Journeys for this audiences I just want to pause for a moment here</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s take this all in because this is going to be a game changer</p>
<p>Adobe Sensei gen AI will fundamentally transform how we do work and for the</p>
<p>better it will help make teams more productive</p>
<p>by giving them a head start now that we have our campaign plan let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dig into the creative production and have a little fun</p>
<p>here in Adobe Creative Cloud this AI generated content</p>
<p>with Adobe Firefly gives the creatives an inspirational starting point and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>served up with compliance checks for brand ethics accessibility and</p>
<p>intellectual property with Adobe generative AI is powerful and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also reliable and on-brand and accessible to all audiences with</p>
<p>Enterprise grade Trust the marketer can play around with the</p>
<p>designs and explore different remixes for additional inspiration</p>
<p>this is truly unlocking creativity for all here</p>
<p>the designer can wants to better capture the spirit of</p>
<p>this campaign and make it more inspirational and based on this change</p>
<p>new headlines and content are generated</p>
<p>the designer can make their necessary edits and send it for approval and then</p>
<p>we head to the next stage of the workflow</p>
<p>now the marketer wants to understand how this is all going to come together for</p>
<p>their customers and Prospects Sensei gen AI creates a snapshot of the</p>
<p>recommended Journey and clicking into more details the</p>
<p>marketer can visualize the engagement touch points and see where the content</p>
<p>will be mapped across channels they can even simulate a journey</p>
<p>and and fine-tune it based on predicted performance</p>
<p>this gives marketers the confidence to know</p>
<p>that this campaign is going to reach their targeted business goals</p>
<p>once they&rsquo;ve made their tweaks they can set it live and once the campaign is</p>
<p>launched it&rsquo;ll be delivered across touch points and personalized to each</p>
<p>individual as they engage with the brand and real-time data will start flowing in</p>
<p>and based on that real-time data of the campaign coming in the results will fuel</p>
<p>the model for continuous training and to fuel future optimizations and insights</p>
<p>and the team is super excited about the positive results of this campaign but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re always on the hunt for the next big thing so when they see a new alert</p>
<p>around sustainability well they&rsquo;re ready to dig right in</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;ve just shared is how Adobe Sensei gen AI will fundamentally</p>
<p>transform the customer experience workflow</p>
<p>by making recommendations that are accessible and actionable by providing</p>
<p>an inspirational starting point for Creative campaigns Journeys and</p>
<p>experiences and by increasing productivity and</p>
<p>efficiencies for teams throughout the Enterprise</p>

<p>thanks for the great demo really good representation of what would be possible</p>
<p>across the Adobe experience Cloud leveraging sensation eye gen AI Services</p>
<p>as well as Firefly so I want to quickly build on what Gina</p>
<p>shared to accomplish an end-to-end customer</p>
<p>experience like you just saw you need reliable scale and accuracy of data that</p>
<p>fuels the generative AI so with Adobe across the experience</p>
<p>cloud with the applications you&rsquo;re using today with the Adobe experience platform</p>
<p>you have access to that signal-rich data sets that are required for generative AI</p>
<p>and as a customer of experience Cloud you can not only leverage all the</p>
<p>goodness that she just shared when you you&rsquo;ll also benefit from</p>
<p>everything that we will build as the potential of generative AI takes hold</p>
<p>over the next couple of years okay to go deeper on Adobe and</p>
<p>generative Ai and to take a look behind the scenes how does this all work today</p>
<p>what is a little bit more about the technology I&rsquo;m happy to welcome Amit</p>
<p>Ahuja who&rsquo;s senior vice president of products for Adobe experience cloud and</p>
<p>Amit will be in conversation with two of our foremost technical experts anjal</p>
<p>bamry who is a senior vice president of engineering for Adobe experience cloud</p>
<p>and Eli Greenfield who is the chief technology officer for our digital media</p>
<p>business Amit over to you [Applause]</p>
<p>[Music] thank you</p>
<p>[Applause]</p>
<p>[Music] this is awesome all right well thank you</p>
<p>Anil and thank you Gina hopefully everyone enjoyed that demo</p>
<p>um it was absolutely fantastic so thank you</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m privileged I&rsquo;m honored to be with the two of you who are largely leading a</p>
<p>lot of the technical efforts around what we&rsquo;ve been discussing</p>
<p>um so super excited to dive into how we&rsquo;re thinking about this go a little</p>
<p>bit deeper on what&rsquo;s been shared um Eli maybe I start with you</p>
<p>we talked a lot about Firefly with David shot new and nil this room is full of</p>
<p>marketers as you look around I think they are very interested to hear</p>
<p>what does Firefly mean to them how do you how do you think about that sure</p>
<p>um thanks Amit you know I mean in short it comes down to from what the</p>
<p>conversations we&rsquo;ve had is around content supply chain right what word</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been using um to go a little bit deeper than that</p>
<p>because you know we&rsquo;re the technical people</p>
<p>um you know from the conversations we&rsquo;ve had with marketers as we&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>developing this technology and looking what&rsquo;s out there on the market what we</p>
<p>hear and you all know this of course is is it&rsquo;s all about</p>
<p>um about more granular approach to audience segmentation into</p>
<p>personalization right that&rsquo;s the name of the game right now but from what we hear</p>
<p>you know everyone is limited essentially by the by the speed at which you can</p>
<p>create the content to support that work and so what&rsquo;s exciting about gen AI for</p>
<p>everyone that we&rsquo;ve you know we&rsquo;ve talked to is</p>
<p>it promises to be a massive productivity boost to creatives and to marketers in</p>
<p>both content creation but also content personalization and adaptation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the excitement of it right but the fear or at least the problem that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve heard from all the conversations is</p>
<p>great but everybody out there has concerns right now about you know the</p>
<p>state of the technology today the state of the market and and whether it&rsquo;s an IP</p>
<p>concern or a licensing concern or a legal concern or you know you name it so</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s excited about it but they can&rsquo;t really dig in yet so when we look</p>
<p>at the way the Market&rsquo;s going we think that this is how it has to go it has to</p>
<p>evolve to to address these concerns for all of these people to be able to use it</p>
<p>and deliver in that promise and that&rsquo;s essentially what we&rsquo;ve done with firefly</p>
<p>is primarily focused on this question of Designing it to be safe for commercial</p>
<p>use I I love that and I love how you linked it we spent a lot of time</p>
<p>yesterday talking about content supply chain I think the fit there is is very</p>
<p>very clear so thank you thank you for that angel maybe I&rsquo;ll come to you so Eli</p>
<p>talked a bit about Firefly and the the marketing aspect we&rsquo;ve also highlighted</p>
<p>so much around the broader experience side of what Gina just showed maybe you</p>
<p>can talk a little bit about how you think about gen AI more broadly in the</p>
<p>context of experience sure thank you um obviously jnai is a very</p>
<p>transformational technology and we are going to see the impact of these</p>
<p>Innovations everywhere and including like you said in how customers are going</p>
<p>to interact with Brands so maybe I&rsquo;ll start with a personal uh anecdote this</p>
<p>is my experience with the chat GPT which which you know I&rsquo;m sharing here because</p>
<p>it highlights the benefits of jnai as well as you know where we still have to</p>
<p>have work to do and things have to be beefed up</p>
<p>so my husband and I are trying to remodel our kitchen</p>
<p>and you know when I was given a task to come up with a plan I thought I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to use chat GPT as my virtual assistant so I asked chat GPT to pretend to be a</p>
<p>design consultant and you know strangely artificial intelligence is very good</p>
<p>about pretending right so there&rsquo;s a Inception kind of a thing going on here</p>
<p>sorry for the for the drift but let me get back to my example so um you know we</p>
<p>had very good back and forth conversation</p>
<p>and for the most part right chat GPT really understood my preferences I</p>
<p>wanted a two-tone kitchen so it recommended you know the right cabinet</p>
<p>colors uh the lighting on the island the flooring that goes with it appliances</p>
<p>where should they be placed so it got me like part of the way there</p>
<p>right I think in the ideation part it helped</p>
<p>but then I also realized during this experience that</p>
<p>there were Parts where it was like Jenny I was missing that debt and</p>
<p>what I mean by that is that even though like you know I had maybe 20 such</p>
<p>conversation that interactions yeah um it never really connected every</p>
<p>interaction about me or any of my touch points any of those transactions so the</p>
<p>the personal context about me was missing yeah</p>
<p>and um it it recommended like appliances and</p>
<p>things like that but the brand specific products and recommendations were not</p>
<p>weaved into that conversation so the so the brand specific context was missing</p>
<p>and the entire conversation was pretty textual so you know I couldn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>upload the picture of my kitchen there were no 2D 3D maps no colors</p>
<p>so it was all very texture and I think that&rsquo;s where lies the</p>
<p>opportunity that you know we can make gen AI a really very context</p>
<p>rich and multimodal so and that I think will really help supercharge these</p>
<p>experiences even more and I know you know Eli is on the multimodal thing so</p>
<p>he is on the multimodal no I think I think Angela your comments on</p>
<p>hey it&rsquo;s providing a huge amount of value but there&rsquo;s still the notion of</p>
<p>personalization about making it more contextually aware I think that</p>
<p>resonates very very well so thank and thank you for the personal story we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>all gone through remodels and know how that is</p>
<p>um uh Eli maybe coming back to you again going back to um the Firefly police in a</p>
<p>little bit we discussed yesterday a little bit around differentiation right</p>
<p>and how we&rsquo;re thinking about it how we&rsquo;re unique it was interesting</p>
<p>following up with us yesterday I was lucky enough to be with a lot of</p>
<p>customers that question keeps coming up a little bit right just around hey how</p>
<p>are you Adobe and unique in what you&rsquo;re doing given there&rsquo;s so many other models</p>
<p>Etc maybe you can spend just another couple minutes on that sure yeah so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple couple points on there I&rsquo;ll start with the one that I think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve said a couple times and I referenced it earlier which is it starts</p>
<p>with what we&rsquo;re training on right and that&rsquo;s where a lot of the questions come</p>
<p>in about these models which is where does the training data come from what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in there and that affects what is this thing going to spit out so because we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>trained on Adobe stock on openly license content on public domain content where</p>
<p>the license is expired we have high degree of confidence of what&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be spitting out and what it&rsquo;s not going to be spinning out because of</p>
<p>the moderation process that content goes through so if you&rsquo;re a consumer goods</p>
<p>company you don&rsquo;t want uh your generated content that&rsquo;s coming through a fast</p>
<p>generation pipeline accidentally spitting out content uh from your</p>
<p>competitor or somebody else using and accidentally spinning out your content</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve designed uh Firefly so it won&rsquo;t do that right</p>
<p>um but of course when you&rsquo;re using it you do want it to be able to generate</p>
<p>content with your brand your IP your look your product in it and so one of</p>
<p>the things that we&rsquo;ll be doing as we roll out Firefly you know going getting</p>
<p>deeper into the products is we&rsquo;ll be focusing on customization and on taking</p>
<p>Firefly and using your own data your own content to be able to customize it for</p>
<p>generating exactly the content you want now obviously that&rsquo;s exciting it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>a little scary because now you&rsquo;re putting your data into this stuff and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re wondering where that&rsquo;s going you know where where your trusted partner</p>
<p>already through the digital experience cloud and so we already you know have</p>
<p>strong principles of data governance and that will go into how we allow</p>
<p>customization to make sure that when you customize a firefly you it&rsquo;ll be for</p>
<p>your use and your use only and there&rsquo;s a bunch of different technologies that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re working on to be able to drive that the third thing I&rsquo;ll say I&rsquo;ll touch</p>
<p>back to what you were saying on Joel which is</p>
<p>um these Technologies are amazing there&rsquo;s a lot of great versions of it</p>
<p>out there we think the benefit is going to come in when we bring it directly</p>
<p>into the workflows so we&rsquo;ll take the core models that we&rsquo;re building the core</p>
<p>technology we&rsquo;re building and we will be integrating that directly into our</p>
<p>creative products our digital experience products to be able to get away from the</p>
<p>the rolling the dice process that you have to go through today of like try a</p>
<p>prompt try a prompt try a prompt to really allow multimodal inputs to allow</p>
<p>iterative higher control processes that allow you to to really get the content</p>
<p>you want and the other thing I&rsquo;ll say is we&rsquo;ll look Beyond images right we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>starting on images here but we&rsquo;ve already got technology that you know</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re developing in-house to take this Beyond images to other content types</p>
<p>also to entire templates so imagine you&rsquo;re you know you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re creating a</p>
<p>social campaign using Express and you want to use generated value to</p>
<p>personalize and to segment and adapt entire Assemblies of time not just the</p>
<p>image but also the text also the content that goes in there also the layout we</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s a lot of of runway for this technology to be able to drive a</p>
<p>wide range of the types of content that you&rsquo;re creating so all right no it makes</p>
<p>it makes perfect sense and it actually was the perfect segue because I think</p>
<p>you alluded to hey one of the things we&rsquo;re really focused on is bringing this</p>
<p>power directly into the workflows and you mentioned the Creative Cloud side</p>
<p>but you also mentioned the experience Cloud side</p>
<p>Angel may be back to you um Gina showed this demo right</p>
<p>showcasing how we&rsquo;re thinking about gen AI much more broadly to your point Eli</p>
<p>than just text copy right we&rsquo;re thinking about audience Etc I think the question</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably top of mind for a lot of folks</p>
<p>when does that show up how does that show up and again I know you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>leading a lot of that so maybe you can just speak to that for a couple minutes</p>
<p>sure and you know Ahmed and I are obviously partnering on on all of this</p>
<p>right so you heard from Anil and and shantanu yesterday that we are</p>
<p>inexperienced Cloud going to be lining up releasing a series of co-pilots</p>
<p>and what I mean by that is that think of it as it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a large language model</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s like a virtual assistant a productivity tool which is</p>
<p>um you know really you know pre-trained on</p>
<p>all the customer data that you have about your customers right so it&rsquo;s it is</p>
<p>very rich from a context standpoint um and sensage Nai as well as Firefly</p>
<p>will definitely be the backbone of of this</p>
<p>um and it&rsquo;ll be pre-trained like I said on the data that you already have</p>
<p>collected about your customers and it could also be pre-trained if you know if</p>
<p>if you like on your brand specific information right it could be products</p>
<p>it could be documentation something that is unique it could be</p>
<p>brand content right it is which is specific to your brand</p>
<p>so with that like we are going to deploy this in kind of two two modes if you</p>
<p>mean there&rsquo;s an external facing co-pilot which is what is going to help with you</p>
<p>know how customers will interact with Brands right so it&rsquo;s going to kind of</p>
<p>sit in the middle of that interaction then they&rsquo;re going to be internal</p>
<p>co-pilots which like you mentioned Amit and like Eli you said that they are</p>
<p>really going to guide the marketing team they&rsquo;ll they&rsquo;ll be the assistance for</p>
<p>the marketers their teams to help them really design experiences you know</p>
<p>Target the right audiences and really amplify those personalized experiences</p>
<p>um maybe if he you know click down one level specifically in the products I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t resist saying that in a real-time customer data platform uh</p>
<p>think of this marketer as um you know it&rsquo;s going to leverage as</p>
<p>well as extend the 360 degree view of the customer via the unified profiles</p>
<p>and the conversations will be powered by the profile</p>
<p>and the you know when you have the conversation the insights the attributes</p>
<p>what was learned during that conversation will feed it back into the</p>
<p>profile so remember like in my example I was</p>
<p>saying that the personal context was missing now the personal context comes</p>
<p>back into the picture with that unified profile and if brand specific</p>
<p>information was added to this then that profile plus that brand information is</p>
<p>making that conversation even richer so so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the uh you know the the</p>
<p>co-pilot that&rsquo;s helping with the conversation now for the marketers it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to help generate audiences right because from the conversation you may</p>
<p>learn that hey I&rsquo;ll stick with my example the kitchen remodeler right now</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a new new segment new audience that gets generated which it didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>before so that&rsquo;s in the real-time customer data platform in Journey</p>
<p>optimizer it&rsquo;s going to help generate Journeys</p>
<p>emails campaigns you know Channel content very quickly so that the</p>
<p>marketers really can iterate test optimize they still have to approve all</p>
<p>of that right so there&rsquo;s always a human in the middle</p>
<p>to make sure that you know it&rsquo;s everything that is being generated</p>
<p>the brand ultimately has to put their kind of their seal of approval that you</p>
<p>know this is good but but since it&rsquo;s everything is generated it&rsquo;s easy to hit</p>
<p>that approve button yeah um in customer Journey analytics</p>
<p>um the the co-pilot will really provide that natural language it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>intuitive natural language interface to analytics for both Visual and text yeah</p>
<p>um and if you look at everything here for Marketo</p>
<p>we pre-trained the co-pilot with the B2B context right with account information</p>
<p>and you get everything now with the context of When a business is talking to</p>
<p>another business yeah so uh you know so that that&rsquo;s and then of course like uh</p>
<p>uh partnering with uh with Eli and team in uh Adobe experience manager right for</p>
<p>Firefly is just a natural I think that&rsquo;s where that&rsquo;s where we showcase the</p>
<p>integration with Express exactly leveraging Firefly I think we showed</p>
<p>that as well which I think there&rsquo;s a lot of there&rsquo;s a lot of excitement there no</p>
<p>it makes yeah I think so for for there for Content generation layout generation</p>
<p>and then last but not the least and that&rsquo;s where I would invite all of you</p>
<p>to partner with us that working with with you we can really generate brand</p>
<p>specific co-pilots I mean I think that&rsquo;s the game changer right because otherwise</p>
<p>the conversations are very generic so those deep insights that deep</p>
<p>understanding is going to come from the brand specific information and yeah I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s how we can collectively wow all of you and wow all of our</p>
<p>customers awesome no thank you I I honestly wish we could go on and on the</p>
<p>light is blinking at me that we cannot go on and on</p>
<p>um so we will not but Eli thank you uh very much anjal thank you very much very</p>
<p>exciting and back to stage thank you so much thank you</p>
<p>foreign [Music]</p>
<p>thank you Ahmed thanks Angel and Eli excited for the possibilities ahead as</p>
<p>you build this generative AI technology integrate them into our applications and</p>
<p>workflows and I love the idea of this brand specific co-pilots or business</p>
<p>specific co-pilots for your business that are really aware of the context of</p>
<p>your customers your principles of how you want to apply the AI and make sure</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s used in a very responsible and transparent way specific to your brand</p>
<p>and specific to your business okay so next up I&rsquo;m really excited about</p>
<p>the next discussion I want to welcome our chairman and CEO shantanu Narayan to</p>
<p>the stage for a conversation with Lisa sue the chair and CEO of AMD I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>really looking forward to this shantanu welcome on stage</p>
<p>[Music] [Applause]</p>
<p>[Music] [Applause]</p>
<p>good morning it&rsquo;s so good to see all of you uh back today but I&rsquo;m delighted to</p>
<p>have Dr Lisa Sue chair and CEO of AMD joining us today at Adobe Summit</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s led the company through this absolutely incredible transformation</p>
<p>over the course of Lisa&rsquo;s career she has received numerous honors</p>
<p>including being named a fellow of The Institute of electronics and electrical</p>
<p>engineers elected through the National Academy</p>
<p>of engineering and I think most impressive recognized</p>
<p>by the IEEE with its highest semiconductor on the Robert and noise</p>
<p>medal and she was recently appointed by President Biden to the president&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Council of advisors on science and technology and from a numbers</p>
<p>perspective yes thank you</p>
<p>from a numbers perspective when you took over as CEO of AMD the revenue is about</p>
<p>4 billion it&rsquo;s approaching 24 billion the market cap was in single-digit</p>
<p>billions and today it&rsquo;s a hundred and sixty billion so just an amazing amazing</p>
<p>accomplishment thank you welcome Lisa and thank you for joining us at Summit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s wonderful to be here and crowd</p>
<p>well since taking over you know the helm in AMD you&rsquo;ve done this amazing</p>
<p>transformation so maybe you can talk a little bit about the turnaround and you</p>
<p>know uh AMD for us well absolutely again thank you so much for being here it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really uh my honor and you know if I just tell you a little bit about</p>
<p>um AMD first of all I&rsquo;m an engineer like you so we like to build things and at</p>
<p>AMD we&rsquo;re all about high performance Computing you know how can we push the</p>
<p>envelope on Computing how can we do more how can we help all of you as creators</p>
<p>and as business people and as marketers you know do more faster better and you</p>
<p>know in technology it&rsquo;s all about making long-term bets and so it has been a</p>
<p>wonderful journey and it&rsquo;s all about how do we get more technology out there to</p>
<p>solve some of the world&rsquo;s most important uh problems</p>
<p>you know till a few years ago if people were talking about chips they would</p>
<p>probably have baked or fried you know as sort of the question but</p>
<p>after uh you know what happened with the global chip shortage everybody is</p>
<p>wondering you know what is it that caused this Global chip shortage so</p>
<p>maybe you can touch on what really happened and how do we address this I</p>
<p>think shronto new is saying that chips were not sexy is that what he was saying</p>
<p>uh look I&rsquo;ve been in the trip business for 30 years you know it&rsquo;s always been</p>
<p>these little things that are under the covers you didn&rsquo;t have to care about it</p>
<p>and then you know sort of you know one day in in a Flash we decided we need to</p>
<p>live and do business and communicate a different way and so it was you know how</p>
<p>do you work from anywhere how do you school from anywhere how do you</p>
<p>communicate when you can&rsquo;t travel how do you get all of this technology and we</p>
<p>had this incredible surge in demand and finally everybody understand wow you</p>
<p>know chips are not just important they&rsquo;re actually essential and they can</p>
<p>really change the way we do things but also</p>
<p>um you know really uh you know they&rsquo;re critical for all the services that we</p>
<p>need and so yeah it&rsquo;s been an amazing ride I think the most important thing</p>
<p>now is that I think we&rsquo;re much more aware of how important it is to have you</p>
<p>know access and resiliency to all of critical Technologies including</p>
<p>semiconductors you know what&rsquo;s absolutely fascinating</p>
<p>to me when you&rsquo;re at a company that&rsquo;s creating something that&rsquo;s at the heart</p>
<p>of everything that people are doing you know how we work how we live uh how we</p>
<p>entertain how do you continuously innovate and how do you think about you</p>
<p>know how the world is going to continue to engage with chips well you know I I</p>
<p>love being in this audience because I know there are so many creators here and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re always thinking about you know what&rsquo;s the next big thing I think um in</p>
<p>our industry it&rsquo;s about uh really long-term bets so somehow we have to</p>
<p>look into the crystal ball and say hey what do we need five years from now you</p>
<p>know what does the world need how can how can technology you know really you</p>
<p>know change the way we do things and um and then make some of those bets and</p>
<p>frankly you know the technology that we&rsquo;re building today we decided uh you</p>
<p>know the the elements of it three to five years ago and now I&rsquo;ll just give</p>
<p>you one example shots new of some of the work that we&rsquo;re doing together when you</p>
<p>think about you know sort of what our creative professionals have to work on</p>
<p>and the technology that they&rsquo;re working with you know if our Computing</p>
<p>technology with your software you know can take the time to render something</p>
<p>you know down from you know 30 minutes to five minutes like just how much more</p>
<p>productive can we be and those are the types of Technology bets that that we</p>
<p>make with the idea of you know we can really you know just change the the rate</p>
<p>and pace of innovation this is a Adobe Summit an adobe Summit</p>
<p>for us has been Lisa all about customer experience management and you know how</p>
<p>people are engaging with their customers you know AMD is at the heart of as we</p>
<p>said this entire Computing Revolution but maybe a little bit about how you</p>
<p>think about marketing you know what AMD does you&rsquo;re an ingredient of every</p>
<p>Computing experience and how do you think about B2B marketing and how is</p>
<p>that evolving yeah though it&rsquo;s a great Point actually I think about it all the</p>
<p>time because we want to reach uh you know broader and broader you know groups</p>
<p>to understand the power of technology and what it can do you know the way I</p>
<p>think about marketing shantanu is it&rsquo;s all about authenticity right we have to</p>
<p>have product truth like what are we really trying to do with the company</p>
<p>what are we trying to do with the products and then that&rsquo;s what you do</p>
<p>with the brand so you know we just recently actually given how broad our</p>
<p>portfolio has become over the last four or five years we actually just recently</p>
<p>introduced a new brand campaign and our campaign is around the thought of you</p>
<p>know together we advance because there&rsquo;s kind of two key principles for us one is</p>
<p>innovation and so as I said it&rsquo;s about Technology Innovation and then the other</p>
<p>is collaboration you know I think I you know we believe that you can&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>anything yourself in this world everything is too complicated you have</p>
<p>experts in each field whether you know Hardware software you know Market</p>
<p>professionals business analytics all of that and you need to figure out how you</p>
<p>bring those together so I think the um the authenticity of the brand is how do</p>
<p>we innovate and collaborate uh together and by the way I use a lot of your</p>
<p>products in my uh in my marketing back end so it certainly we we appreciate</p>
<p>um you know the Deep partnership but I think the overarching thing is you know</p>
<p>how do we translate um you know what is perhaps an esoteric</p>
<p>you know concept into something that everyone can Digest</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;ve been uh spending some time talking about some of the new</p>
<p>things that adobe announced uh generative AI but you know for the</p>
<p>audience there&rsquo;s clearly so many buzzwords that are out there right now</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s crypto or metaverse or AI or generative AI or chat GPT autonomous</p>
<p>cars just to name maybe a few I I&rsquo;d love your perspective on you know how you</p>
<p>think about you know how these Trends are going to impact the future and maybe</p>
<p>a second question is there one that we&rsquo;re not talking about enough that you</p>
<p>feel like is going to become the next buzzword well um I think this is the</p>
<p>week the month maybe the year of AI I think you can&rsquo;t go anywhere and uh and</p>
<p>not talk about Ai and congratulations on the Firefly announcements since I</p>
<p>um announcements you know when I think about AI I think about it in kind of two</p>
<p>pieces right one is the AI That&rsquo;s under the covers uh which is the data</p>
<p>analytics how do we become smarter with all of this tons of data that we are</p>
<p>generating um how do we get make most use of it but</p>
<p>I think the piece that has you know really unlocked potential and I know you</p>
<p>guys have talked about it uh here over the last day or two as well you know the</p>
<p>generative AI concept of you know you can actually have it&rsquo;s sort of like your</p>
<p>little personal assistant or your co-pilot helping you you know solve of</p>
<p>whatever your you know your problem set is I mean that&rsquo;s just incredibly</p>
<p>powerful now the technology that we&rsquo;re doing around AI is training these</p>
<p>incredibly large data sets and then allowing people to access that data</p>
<p>right you need an incredible amount of computing power tens of thousands of you</p>
<p>know gpus and CPUs but that capability I think just unlocks new</p>
<p>things and when I think about like when even my dad is talking about chat GPT I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know how many of uh how many of your uh everywhere you go it&rsquo;s like what</p>
<p>can you do with that I I think you can see that it&rsquo;s capturing people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>imaginations and the key is you know how are we going to use it for business</p>
<p>Advantage right how are each of us in our world going to use it for business</p>
<p>advantage to make us a bit more productive I think you know we were</p>
<p>talking a bit about how uh it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s so early right I mean you&rsquo;re in beta phase</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of of work to really see how AI can unlock the power but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you can see how it can make us 50 more productive or 80 more productive</p>
<p>and think about how we can use those Cycles now to do so many other things</p>
<p>so um your second question what what has it not done</p>
<p>um I think we&rsquo;re just at the very beginning I think we&rsquo;re at the very</p>
<p>beginning now you know for my team you know we we build chips that are</p>
<p>um our largest ship now is like a hundred billion transistors</p>
<p>and it takes us about you know three years uh from start to finish now if I</p>
<p>could cut that in half or if I can make sure that it&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>right on day one it has just tremendous business value</p>
<p>um in that so all of us are learning together it&rsquo;s a complete race I would</p>
<p>you agree shots knew that this is the one place where I see everyone kind of</p>
<p>leaning forward and leaning in and willing to experiment</p>
<p>uh I would I would and I think you know it&rsquo;s uh we&rsquo;re all also tackling with the</p>
<p>responsibility of what AI ethics means and I you know just maybe your thoughts</p>
<p>because one of the concerns is that I I did want to check on whether your father</p>
<p>dad&rsquo;s checking up on you know how Lisa is doing on chat GPT but I maybe a</p>
<p>little bit on the ethics and the concerns about does this replace humans</p>
<p>versus augmented just your perspective yeah I</p>
<p>need for let&rsquo;s call it safe Ai and uh again I think you guys have been very</p>
<p>thoughtful in how you&rsquo;ve thought about it we&rsquo;re also thinking about it you know</p>
<p>how do you ensure that the data that&rsquo;s being trained is is not biased in some</p>
<p>way or is not leading us down the wrong path but my view of the world is there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a replacement at all uh you know the creative genius of you know</p>
<p>everyone um in this room can can actually just be</p>
<p>even a little bit faster a little bit better a little bit more capable uh</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not talking about replacement but we&rsquo;re really talking about augmentation</p>
<p>and and productivity so it is it is going to be a fascinating error over the</p>
<p>next uh 10 years I would say if there are two themes here uh Lisa one</p>
<p>is about how technology is going to uh you know change the other one is about</p>
<p>leadership and culture and so I I know you&rsquo;ve talked a lot uh throughout your</p>
<p>career and even after you took over the Helm of AMD about this adage of run</p>
<p>towards problems so maybe you can talk a little bit about you know change and how</p>
<p>do you accomplish change in organizations well it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>wonderful thing I mean we we all work so hard by the way you know I think we wake</p>
<p>up every day and we say we love what we do we might as well work on something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really important and so you know running towards problems um using a</p>
<p>technology for good finding a way to partner to solve something that you</p>
<p>never thought possible you know those are the things that have guided me and</p>
<p>then you know when I think about um you know what we do at AMD and how we</p>
<p>bring people together under this notion of joint collaboration it&rsquo;s how can we</p>
<p>take one plus one and make it you know greater than three and and uh you know</p>
<p>really use that to motivate so it&rsquo;s not about what are you doing with the</p>
<p>technology it&rsquo;s what what problem are we solving for society you know with the</p>
<p>technology you know you&rsquo;ve been an incredible role</p>
<p>model for so many folks Lisa and maybe you know just a little on uh championing</p>
<p>you know championing diversity being a role model and and how you think about</p>
<p>that in today&rsquo;s work culture well I you know the the one thing that I would say</p>
<p>is you know as we you know go through life it&rsquo;s all about the opportunities</p>
<p>that people give us um I was very very fortunate you know I</p>
<p>grew up um in an environment where you know you</p>
<p>know people were very open it didn&rsquo;t matter you know how old you are how</p>
<p>young you were where did you come from you know male female all of that you</p>
<p>wanted the best ideas and at the end of the day that&rsquo;s the most important thing</p>
<p>about diversity is how do you get the best diversity of ideas so you can make</p>
<p>that one plus one uh be uh greater than three and</p>
<p>um you know what uh what I try to do and I think what we&rsquo;re all trying to do as</p>
<p>CEOs of large companies is to create the opportunities and the pipeline so that</p>
<p>people get a chance to learn and experiment and fail and make mistakes</p>
<p>and really have that diversity of ideas uh come together</p>
<p>one of the things that struck me about what you talk about the purpose of AMD</p>
<p>is together we advance so I two questions there maybe one of our purpose</p>
<p>and the role that purpose plays in an organization and maybe second about</p>
<p>Partnerships when because you use the word together and I assume it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>employees and Partnerships so a little bit on both yeah so when you think about</p>
<p>purpose and let&rsquo;s talk about technology for good uh there you know people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t realize how much you can accelerate if you really take technology</p>
<p>to its limits and I&rsquo;ll give you another example you know during the pandemic I</p>
<p>think those first few months we were all figuring out how are we going to run our</p>
<p>businesses and then we were also going to figure out you know how do we help</p>
<p>how do we you know come and help the uh you know sort of the global ecosystem</p>
<p>kind of solve this problem and um you know we did things like we came together</p>
<p>across the industry ecosystem and said hey let&rsquo;s donate a ton of computing</p>
<p>power such that we can accelerate the rate and pace of uh you know vaccine</p>
<p>research and all of the uh the Therapeutics and and the learning around</p>
<p>that like we did that in like you know a week in normal weight and Pace that</p>
<p>might take like a year with all of these various things but it was the purpose of</p>
<p>we had a common goal of trying to solve um you know problems I mean some of the</p>
<p>my most in interesting technology projects are you know things like how do</p>
<p>we use Tech in healthcare and I know you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re also a very uh very</p>
<p>personally involved in healthcare but I mean there&rsquo;s so much more we can do Sean</p>
<p>new if we really took the uh the best of you know technology capability the best</p>
<p>uh medical professionals The Best of You Know systems and software folks and put</p>
<p>them together and say how can I do this much faster and much more efficiently</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what I believe you know purpose is I mean there&rsquo;s lots of things</p>
<p>that we do to uh you know for our business but there&rsquo;s so much more we can</p>
<p>do when we come together in Partnership across various disciplines to um to</p>
<p>learn and make the world a a better place</p>
<p>as a giant technology company I don&rsquo;t know about Giants</p>
<p>yeah how do you think about you know when you&rsquo;re both</p>
<p>partnering as well as potentially competing with some of the companies</p>
<p>just maybe you know how that&rsquo;s evolving for you yeah it&rsquo;s a great question I</p>
<p>think I better than ever you know partnership is</p>
<p>King and partnership is King meaning um you know we&rsquo;re all specialists in</p>
<p>certain areas like when we can put the power of adobe engineers and AMD</p>
<p>Engineers together we will create um you know better content creation</p>
<p>capability we&rsquo;ll create better marketing capability we&rsquo;ll create better platforms</p>
<p>if we have our teams operating uh together versus operating in silos like</p>
<p>we each do our things and sure there&rsquo;s you know there&rsquo;s you know we&rsquo;re also</p>
<p>large enough that there&rsquo;s a lot of competition out there but more than</p>
<p>anything I think you know open platforms will really help us become uh you know</p>
<p>really take the best of breed and we&rsquo;re getting to a place where you know what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to do is bend the curve of what&rsquo;s capable and I like to say that</p>
<p>because you know people used to say you know why do you even need the Next</p>
<p>Generation anything like isn&rsquo;t it good enough and uh the truth is no like it</p>
<p>can be so much better it can be 10 times better it can be 100 times better I mean</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the that&rsquo;s the power of partnership and and deep deep</p>
<p>collaboration you know I&rsquo;m sure I speak for everybody</p>
<p>when I say that nobody&rsquo;s ever said my PC is fast enough of my networks fast</p>
<p>enough and so we&rsquo;re all willing to consume whatever power you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to provide maybe one question on you know we all have our pet projects at</p>
<p>the company where we feel like there&rsquo;s going to be something anything exciting</p>
<p>that you want to share with us in terms of you know what&rsquo;s going to happen in</p>
<p>Computing probably uh the most um exciting you know we all have our</p>
<p>favorite you know things but uh one of my most favorite projects is uh we&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>the middle of building the fastest supercomputer in the world so can I wear</p>
<p>it on my hand it will um it will take a very large</p>
<p>building uh right now so the current fastest supercomputer in the world is at</p>
<p>Oak Ridge National Labs um it&rsquo;s uh you know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s based on</p>
<p>AMD technology there&rsquo;s another one that&rsquo;s coming in uh this coming year</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re in the middle of building and why are these things fascinating because</p>
<p>you get to break every problem right you get to you break everything when you</p>
<p>have to um you know kind of aim at the top and what it&rsquo;s being used for is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be used for um you know significant uh you know government as</p>
<p>well as private research and um you know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s one of those fun</p>
<p>things that you get to do and now my goal is to take that and make sure you</p>
<p>have it in a few years and you know run run your stuff on it too</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s awesome we can&rsquo;t wait uh as I&rsquo;ve always told you we&rsquo;ll consume as</p>
<p>much power and as much chip capacity as you give us I&rsquo;m counting on that yes</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to end with sometimes with the word association so I&rsquo;ll just give you a</p>
<p>word and whatever one word comes to mind Lisa maybe you can uh you know respond</p>
<p>with that okay I have no idea what words you&rsquo;re gonna tell me so okay let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>semiconductors</p>
<p>essential New York home</p>
<p>MIT lots of geeky people</p>
<p>for those of you who don&rsquo;t know Lisa has three degrees from MIT including a PhD</p>
<p>which is yeah very geeky High geek Factor yes</p>
<p>culture humble</p>
<p>artificial intelligence the most important thing over the next</p>
<p>10 years impact</p>
<p>impact I think it&rsquo;s personal what is our</p>
<p>personal impact and lastly Lisa sue your friend thank you so much please thank</p>
<p>Lisa thank you thank you</p>
<p>[Music] thank you thank you Lisa and shantana</p>
<p>really appreciate what Lisa shared about authentic Brands very important</p>
<p>importance of Partnerships in collaboration and for her personally</p>
<p>about running towards problems throughout her career and the success</p>
<p>that he has brought for her and for AMD lots of lessons for all of us</p>
<p>all right next I&rsquo;m really excited to introduce our</p>
<p>next speaker Academy award-winning writer director and playwright Aaron</p>
<p>Sorkin Aaron yes a lot of applause</p>
<p>huge fan I&rsquo;m a huge fan Aaron is a master at storytelling from</p>
<p>his Broadway playwriting debut at the age of 28 with the military courtroom</p>
<p>drama A Few Good Men to the scripts of feature films</p>
<p>including Moneyball social network the TV series The West Wing and Newsroom and</p>
<p>so many more he&rsquo;s won countless Awards Critics Choice</p>
<p>sag Emmy Peabody to name just a few and to say that he&rsquo;s a master when it comes</p>
<p>to content I think that would be an understatement a vast understatement so</p>
<p>in fact I understand that Aaron wrote A Few Good Men on a series of cocktail</p>
<p>napkins please join me in welcoming adobe&rsquo;s own</p>
<p>VP of marketing and communication Stacy martinay in conversation with Aaron Sir</p>
<p>Ken Stacy</p>
<p>welcome Aaron to Adobe Summit it&rsquo;s great to be here holy cow are there</p>
<p>a lot of you the seats are packed for you there&rsquo;s people online from around</p>
<p>the world and we&rsquo;ve been talking a lot about and I know you don&rsquo;t love this</p>
<p>word content the last few days and so who better to talk about the enduring</p>
<p>power of Storytelling than you yeah uh when I started doing this I I</p>
<p>was uh a playwright and a and a screenwriter and somehow my job title</p>
<p>changed a little just the last few years I&rsquo;m a content creator now we all are</p>
<p>well then</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s my first question did you always want to be a writer slash content</p>
<p>creator did I always want to be a content creator no yeah</p>
<p>um uh uh I I</p>
<p>thought what I wanted to be was an actor uh and when I was little when I was in</p>
<p>school I was in all the school plays I was in the community theater Productions</p>
<p>I went to college and got a degree in uh theater in fact I got a degree in</p>
<p>musical theater okay and it wasn&rsquo;t until the day after I graduated from college</p>
<p>that for the first time ever I tried writing</p>
<p>I I asked for something to be uh I tried writing for pleasure I tried writing for</p>
<p>a reason other than a chore to be gotten through for a school assignment and I</p>
<p>tried writing dialogue and uh I just was suddenly felt much more</p>
<p>confident uh with than I&rsquo;ve ever felt as an actor and I was a pretty cocky actor</p>
<p>um but uh I I fell in love with storytelling and it turned out all those</p>
<p>years when my friends were learning how to act I was kind of learning what a</p>
<p>play was and learning what a story was so I have to ask if it&rsquo;s true then</p>
<p>did you write a Few Good Men on a napkin I wrote A Few Good Men well I had a ton</p>
<p>of survival jobs after I graduated from college I moved to New York uh to start</p>
<p>my career as a struggling artist I had a bunch of survival jobs and one of them</p>
<p>was bartending at Broadway theaters and when you have that job you don&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>during the first act right you get there and you&rsquo;re working the walk-in that half</p>
<p>hour when people are coming into the theater you&rsquo;re working intermission</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s not much that you&rsquo;re doing during the First Act and so I wrote A</p>
<p>Few Good Men on cocktail Atkins the play A Few Good Men on cocktail napkins</p>
<p>during the First Act of La Casa fall I would go home with my pockets stuffed</p>
<p>with these cocktails um spilled them out on a desk and I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>start typing it on my my two roommates and I had gone in on uh</p>
<p>but it was just called a Macintosh</p>
<p>it was 128k uh which is if you get a birthday card</p>
<p>that sings happy birthday when you open it that thing has more memory than</p>
<p>than that Macintosh but I I thought that this was uh an incredible invention</p>
<p>and I couldn&rsquo;t imagine though who was going to use this except for a</p>
<p>playwright uh I I found it useful because it had a delete key so you</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have to use whiteout um uh and and you could copy a paste you</p>
<p>could move scenes around uh but I couldn&rsquo;t think of a reason why anyone</p>
<p>else would uh would need this you&rsquo;re an early adopter it was an early adopter</p>
<p>later I would write a movie about the invention of a a website of Facebook and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d write a movie about Steve Jobs that&rsquo;s right so speaking of Technology</p>
<p>this is a conference about technology and Innovation and how it&rsquo;s changing how</p>
<p>Industries interact with customers consumers viewers so I wonder for you</p>
<p>and more broadly the entertainment industry at large how should you Embrace</p>
<p>these Technologies or not okay</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get down to it this is a conference about technology</p>
<p>what in hell am I doing here</p>
<p>okay honestly I I don&rsquo;t know how to use Adobe that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>true nope we have an app for you uh you have an app yeah it&rsquo;s called Adobe</p>
<p>Express and we have a new a new technology called Adobe Firefly that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to help you make things with generative AI but the reason that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>here is because you tell stories and so no matter the channel or the platform</p>
<p>great stories stand out so talk to us about that yeah listen uh</p>
<p>movies uh in particular movies are where you know Art and Science mean in a</p>
<p>number of places uh when you&rsquo;re making a movie and uh and the fact of the matter</p>
<p>is especially since I&rsquo;ve started directing as well I directed the last</p>
<p>three movies that I wrote uh and I have found that technology</p>
<p>is not only helpful it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s necessary uh it in in making the film that uh for</p>
<p>instance uh the trial of the Chicago seven uh</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re staging a scene that has thousands of protesters in in a riot</p>
<p>with hundreds of uh police officers you&rsquo;re someone like me isn&rsquo;t going to</p>
<p>get a budget for thousands of extras and hundreds of police officers so crowd</p>
<p>duplication uh is incredibly helpful also that movie takes place in 1968 and</p>
<p>1969 and we&rsquo;re shooting it in Chicago in 2020 so I&rsquo;m going to have to take out</p>
<p>erase certain architecture put certain architecture uh uh in their technology</p>
<p>can help me with that that&rsquo;s those are you very rudimentary uses of</p>
<p>of technology and filmmaking on the other end of the spectrum you know as</p>
<p>Avatar which is is made almost entirely uh by</p>
<p>uh technological Minds meeting a great storytelling mine in uh in James Cameron</p>
<p>where I get nervous about technology where where I don&rsquo;t think technology is</p>
<p>as useful as we&rsquo;re celebrating it to be is when I&rsquo;ll hear about</p>
<p>software or AI that can write a screenplay for you</p>
<p>um I you don&rsquo;t think it could write The West</p>
<p>Wing uh</p>
<p>no uh I don&rsquo;t either I I don&rsquo;t because</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what I assume has happened and again I&rsquo;m the wrong guy to I&rsquo;m the wrong</p>
<p>guy to be talking to you I&rsquo;m sorry but um</p>
<p>but whether it whether it&rsquo;s that or there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s roughly the same kind of</p>
<p>software for for writing a hit song um I assume that they have loaded into a</p>
<p>machine uh a</p>
<p>zillion very successful screenplays whether they&rsquo;re very Thrillers or</p>
<p>westerns or romantic comedies um uh and uh</p>
<p>and and a computer can can then turn out something similar</p>
<p>but a computer didn&rsquo;t write those screenplays that are being fed into the</p>
<p>machine in the first place um uh and</p>
<p>I I I I think you&rsquo;re going to enjoy things done by humans more I agree I</p>
<p>agree I also if I can say one more thing yes</p>
<p>uh and I&rsquo;m not I&rsquo;m not trying to put everyone here out of business and and</p>
<p>like I said the uh uh technology that&rsquo;s been developed has has allowed people</p>
<p>like me to make movies that I wouldn&rsquo;t have been allowed to make 10 or 20 years</p>
<p>ago uh</p>
<p>but I find that</p>
<p>computerize a computerized battle scene with thousands of people I was shooting</p>
<p>a scene this was several years ago and I was shooting the scene I was very proud</p>
<p>that we had built this Set uh that was two stories it was entirely cool what</p>
<p>was this for it was for a TV series I did called Studio 60 on the sunset</p>
<p>Studio 6 only lasted a season but we built inside a Sound Stage we built uh</p>
<p>an old theater that was two stories that had all kinds of offices and you could</p>
<p>it was like built for for what I write you you could take a a Steadicam walk</p>
<p>around this whole thing um and uh we were shooting the third</p>
<p>episode of the fourth episode and uh we were about to start rehearsing and I</p>
<p>remember saying to one of the producers this is going to be great because this</p>
<p>is going to be the shot thought that proves to the audience that we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>faking it that this isn&rsquo;t on two different sound stages that this is one</p>
<p>whole set that we built uh and he said yeah the problem is we could also have a</p>
<p>dinosaur walking around uh of the set and he was right</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found that uh the the more technology advances in filmmaking the</p>
<p>less impressive those scenes are um I&rsquo;m more impressed by Lawrence of</p>
<p>Arabia uh you know knowing that it was all done with with humans yes</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s okay our business is fine okay yeah so</p>
<p>um we think that we think technology can be a co-pilot but we still need human</p>
<p>creativity and Ingenuity yes and listen I think technology could be a co-pilot</p>
<p>too and part of my attitude comes from the fact that I duh I have to sit in a</p>
<p>room with people who are experts at it and not know anything</p>
<p>um you know and they&rsquo;ll turn and say you know what what</p>
<p>do you think if we throw an a30 on there it&rsquo;ll it&rsquo;ll be nice a 30 a 31 whatever</p>
<p>it takes um I I</p>
<p>I I feel left behind</p>
<p>well you&rsquo;re here you made it um okay The West Wing The Social Network</p>
<p>yeah Moneyball Charlie Wilson&rsquo;s War your work looks at transformative moments in</p>
<p>history and culture and brings them to life so vividly through characters so</p>
<p>what inspires you what&rsquo;s your process I mean how do you come up how do you come</p>
<p>up with these amazing pieces of work well that&rsquo;s really nice of you to say</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>drama is intention and obstacle okay somebody wants something something</p>
<p>standing in their way of getting it they want the money they want the girl they</p>
<p>want to get to Philadelphia uh it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>as as long as they want it badly if they needed that that&rsquo;s even better the</p>
<p>obstacle that&rsquo;s standing in their way has to be formidable and the tactics</p>
<p>that they that they use to try to overcome that obstacle</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the story uh unless you&rsquo;re telling doesn&rsquo;t matter if the</p>
<p>protagonist your hero if your hero uh succeeds or fails at overcoming the</p>
<p>obstacle um that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s for you to decide</p>
<p>in my case uh that conflict uh that friction it&rsquo;s generally it&rsquo;s a conflict</p>
<p>of ideas uh that that&rsquo;s what I like writing about</p>
<p>um generally I like writing people in rooms</p>
<p>talking and walking and I&rsquo;m not in charge of the walking part</p>
<p>unless I&rsquo;m unless I&rsquo;m directing it but yes uh and and walking just to give a</p>
<p>little visual interest to what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>um I I uh I have there are exceptions to</p>
<p>this but I uh um I like writing romantically and</p>
<p>idealistically uh aspirationally I like it</p>
<p>if the audience just can feel two inches taller when the lights come up at the</p>
<p>end than they did at the beginning get taller here</p>
<p>all right who is your favorite character that you&rsquo;ve written and why</p>
<p>you know this sounds silly and it sounds trite when you say they&rsquo;re like my</p>
<p>children so I don&rsquo;t wanna but they&rsquo;re like my children so I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna um I&rsquo;ll tell you that most of the</p>
<p>characters that I&rsquo;ve written the protagonists</p>
<p>uh in one form or another that have have been a version of my father</p>
<p>um uh my father passed away a few years ago</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry so oh no no that&rsquo;s he was 95. uh so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s generally my favorite character that I&rsquo;ve written is the most recent one</p>
<p>uh that I&rsquo;ve read so uh I have I have written a new version of Camelot yes</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written a new version of the of the King Arthur Legend uh that&rsquo;s uh opening</p>
<p>night is April 13th at Lincoln Center and we&rsquo;re in previews right now so I</p>
<p>guess that well congratulations thank you thank you uh so at the moment my</p>
<p>favorite character is King Arthur not a bad character to have no okay so we love</p>
<p>all of our children but some of them are more of a problem</p>
<p>than others I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m glad you mentioned that okay</p>
<p>uh were you referring to the inventor of Facebook no I was gonna see where you</p>
<p>were going you&rsquo;ve got to tell okay</p>
<p>um okay damn say more</p>
<p>look when you&rsquo;re writing uh</p>
<p>a problematic character um</p>
<p>an anti-hero and in in the in The Social Network Mark Zuckerberg is</p>
<p>an anti-hero uh as the writer you can&rsquo;t judge that character uh okay</p>
<p>um you you have to be able to identify with</p>
<p>that character and you have to write the character as if that character is making</p>
<p>their case to God why they should be allowed into heaven</p>
<p>um same thing with uh you know Nicholson&rsquo;s character uh and A Few Good</p>
<p>Men that&rsquo;s why he gets the big speech in the courtroom he gets to make his case</p>
<p>uh to God why she should be allowed to Heaven if I&rsquo;ve been successful that</p>
<p>speech will be over and people will say he&rsquo;s got a point</p>
<p>how many times has someone even said you can&rsquo;t handle the truth</p>
<p>it caught on</p>
<p>surprised as anyone um I didn&rsquo;t write it and think</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna hang my hat on on that line uh I just one day was driving down the</p>
<p>street and saw a giant billboard for Burger King and it said you can&rsquo;t handle</p>
<p>this Whopper [Laughter]</p>
<p>I thought there&rsquo;s my parents tuition money</p>
<p>okay well speaking of hits I mean you&rsquo;re a hit maker and one of the things</p>
<p>content creators struggle with is is the breaking through especially in you know</p>
<p>all these social media channels and apps and so</p>
<p>how do you know do you feel it when you&rsquo;re writing a hit</p>
<p>I mean how what are the ingredients</p>
<p>I suppose that if I knew what the ingredients were for a hit that I would</p>
<p>try to to do that uh it&rsquo;s fun having a hit but</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t and neither is anyone else uh and</p>
<p>I think that trying to figure out what it is everybody wants or what it is the</p>
<p>most people want and giving it to them is a bad recipe for storytelling</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>you know uh there are dozens there are hundreds of</p>
<p>ways to prepare beef right if you were a chef there are hundreds of ways to</p>
<p>prepare beef but if you prepared beef the way that you were sure would appeal</p>
<p>to the most people it would be a McDonald&rsquo;s hamburger every time</p>
<p>um there I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve now zached to McDonald&rsquo;s and Burger</p>
<p>King in one their marketing line really in one</p>
<p>session storytellers content creators</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re leaders okay we&rsquo;re not followers uh uh we&rsquo;re leaders</p>
<p>I writing is hard at least it is for me uh</p>
<p>and uh I I try to write what I like</p>
<p>what I think my friends would like and then I keep my fingers crossed that</p>
<p>enough other people like it that I I get to keep doing it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s worked out so far so far Okay so but it wouldn&rsquo;t be an Aaron Sorkin piece</p>
<p>if we didn&rsquo;t have an iconic quotable line</p>
<p>so Erin</p>
<p>what is your favorite line</p>
<p>oh gosh um</p>
<p>I I</p>
<p>think</p>
<p>not I I feel like it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not for me to say</p>
<p>uh there there listen there have been moments uh where I&rsquo;ve been in my office</p>
<p>you know late at night writing a scene and yeah I best but boy that that was</p>
<p>good I&rsquo;m gonna like it tomorrow too uh I can tell this isn&rsquo;t just right now I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna like it tomorrow too the I</p>
<p>uh there are many more times that I&rsquo;m frustrated and it&rsquo;s just coming out like</p>
<p>ketchup out of a bottle um and it&rsquo;s not working uh but I just</p>
<p>just like a you know a golfer lives for that moment where for some reason</p>
<p>he or she can hit a golf shot um uh I a writer lives for that</p>
<p>when they uh when they write a good scene</p>
<p>um so</p>
<p>that was a deeply unsatisfying answer to your question I know it&rsquo;s okay I&rsquo;m in</p>
<p>communication so I understand well congratulations with Camelot thank you I</p>
<p>hope some folks will be able to see it when it opens and thank you for spending</p>

<p>six months so I thank you thank you</p>
<p>glad to be here</p>
<p>the last six months wow just tell us how you&rsquo;re doing right now I&rsquo;m doing fine</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking it day by day I found out that that&rsquo;s the best to do it&rsquo;s been a</p>
<p>roller coaster of emotions each and every day so I&rsquo;m just taking it day by</p>
<p>day whatever I got that day I&rsquo;m giving it 100 I like it let&rsquo;s go back to your</p>
<p>youth why football you know football for me it was</p>
<p>something I found the love from from my father he played</p>
<p>um he played semi-pro football so I was a young I was young going to his games</p>
<p>and just watching him play and I probably barely ever watched him play I</p>
<p>was probably somewhere playing in a creek or playing under the bridge trying</p>
<p>to find some frogs or something but um you know I kind of found the love of</p>
<p>the game from him and adopted the number three from him and it just it just been</p>
<p>there it&rsquo;s just been up from sin and did you always know that you wanted to play</p>
<p>in the NFL yeah I always knew I think it was about high school when I figured out</p>
<p>that I actually could have a chance to have a shot if I stayed true to what I</p>
<p>knew was right so um once I got to high school I knew this</p>
<p>was what I wanted to do what&rsquo;s the best piece of advice you received while you</p>
<p>were pursuing your career in football that helped you motivate helped motivate</p>
<p>you and helps you stay on track it&rsquo;s a quote actually from my father</p>
<p>when I was young it&rsquo;s go hard you never know who&rsquo;s watching and you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not like the fanciest quote it&rsquo;s not like the flashiest but it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that stuck with me no matter what no matter what room I was in no matter what</p>
<p>no matter where I was I always kept that quote with me like I had to do my best</p>
<p>you never know who&rsquo;s watching you never know who&rsquo;s over there in the corner you</p>
<p>know evaluating you so during the process that was that&rsquo;s what stuck with</p>
<p>me you&rsquo;re a highly recruited High School</p>
<p>defensive player attended the University of Pittsburgh drafted by the Buffalo</p>
<p>Bills tell us what makes the bills organization and the fans so special</p>
<p>there we go hey got some bills Mafia out there I love it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a unique place all the vets that walk through the building since day one</p>
<p>I got in there they say cherish this place it&rsquo;s not like this everywhere</p>
<p>across the league so you know hearing that and then going through the process</p>
<p>of my situation and seeing how personal that it was from top to bottom for</p>
<p>everyone and how much love that they showed me in-house that&rsquo;s just one thing</p>
<p>that stood out to me that that it&rsquo;s a special place in Buffalo there&rsquo;s nowhere</p>
<p>like it yeah tomorrow I had a terrible uh rookie NFL season I</p>
<p>threw 28 interceptions which is still an NFL rookie record that I hold today 3</p>
<p>and 13 3 and 13 right 3 and 13. thank you yeah</p>
<p>maybe you can help me with that resume uh if you could help one of the rookie</p>
<p>quarterbacks this year throw a lot of interceptions that would help me out a</p>
<p>lot but uh what do you love most about playing</p>
<p>defense um you know it&rsquo;s something that came</p>
<p>natural to me which is kind of crazy I was at a youth All-Star game when I was</p>
<p>I think 11 and my dad kept wanting me to go on offense and like you know score</p>
<p>touchdowns but I kept migrating into the defensive line and he was just like</p>
<p>getting so upset but it&rsquo;s just what came natural I don&rsquo;t know what it is but it</p>
<p>takes a different mindset to be able to react to someone who knows what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing and um it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s just like a mentality thing I think for me that I</p>
<p>really love and enjoy favorite player growing up Troy Polamalu big big</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Steeler fan yeah yeah big big Pittsburgh Steeler fans so Troy Polamalu</p>
<p>was definitely one of my favorite players but also um Darrell Rivas him</p>
<p>being from Pittsburgh area and you know I just seen him at a Super Bowl when he</p>
<p>got inducted in the Hall of Fame so it was pretty cool yeah I&rsquo;ve thrown a lot</p>
<p>of interceptions to both of those guys as well so</p>
<p>Role Models mentors especially coaches Demar they&rsquo;ve been so important to me on</p>
<p>and off the field during my career even after my career tell us how important</p>
<p>coaches have been to you and can you share a few stories yeah coaches have</p>
<p>played an important role in my growth as an athlete and also as a man</p>
<p>my first coach that I was speaking on Rick capretta he was my high school</p>
<p>defensive back coach and I went to a big high school from a small town in in</p>
<p>Pittsburgh McKees Rocks and it was like going from being a big fish in a little</p>
<p>Pond to a little fish in a big pond and I I believed in myself but he put that</p>
<p>he put that belief in me that I was special that that I didn&rsquo;t have to worry</p>
<p>about fitting in because I was special and I had a special gift so you know</p>
<p>that belief in me that that um it took me a long way anytime I still speak to</p>
<p>him till this day he&rsquo;s still giving me that same type of love that same belief</p>
<p>and it just fuels me as a as a as a man yeah College you know my coach is</p>
<p>showing trust showing trust in me that to lead the way and you know same thing</p>
<p>to the NFL you know coach McDermott you know him showing me the love the trust</p>
<p>the care like I can remember it specifically we were playing the Ravens</p>
<p>my second start this season I think game four and um</p>
<p>I had it was a double call where you know you run one call this this</p>
<p>information one more calls this information and being a young player</p>
<p>looking at the wrong things probably I I missed the adjustment so I could hear my</p>
<p>other coaches screaming from the sideline that um I was supposed to go I</p>
<p>was supposed to Blitz and I was late missed the tackle bounced outside of me</p>
<p>for about like 17 yards late in the fourth quarter I think it&rsquo;s a tie ball</p>
<p>game too late in the fourth quarter they&rsquo;re in like the red zone now so you</p>
<p>know we end up calling the time out and like coach McDermott just calls me over</p>
<p>with so much Poise and calmness and just breaks the whole situation down to me</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re right like we&rsquo;re gonna need you you&rsquo;re gonna make a big play</p>
<p>for us uh down this stretch you know and I happen to make a big tackle for us on</p>
<p>third down we got an interceptional fourth down and went on to win the game</p>
<p>um so you know just situations like that it it um it really touches me and it</p>
<p>really makes me want to play for people like that and you said that coach</p>
<p>McDermott actually turned to you uh this past year about being more of a leader</p>
<p>on the field even though you&rsquo;re still technically a young player yeah just</p>
<p>being a leader just I think you know just playing with passion being</p>
<p>consistent in my role in just developing that trust on the field towards down the</p>
<p>stretch you know I definitely felt like he was calling on me to to raise the bar</p>
<p>and step up as a leader of our defense like the favorite quarterback to play</p>
<p>against and why favorite quarterback to play against I</p>
<p>would say Kenny Pickett at your college team yeah yeah just because that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>college teammate yeah that&rsquo;s my college teammate I love playing against you know</p>
<p>people that I was you know on The Chase Wood and in the process with because you</p>
<p>know just being here it just it gives you that old feeling of like</p>
<p>when you wanted to to be where you&rsquo;re at now so anytime I can play against any</p>
<p>guys like that uh but if you had a chance to intercept Kenny in an NFL game</p>
<p>I mean you wouldn&rsquo;t drop it on purpose right</p>
<p>not a chance in the world I&rsquo;m gonna take it and I&rsquo;m gonna rub it in but he knows</p>
<p>that I just he knows that too and he&rsquo;s probably trying to get me as much as he</p>
<p>can as well toughest Stadium to play in</p>
<p>arrowhead&rsquo;s a tough place [Applause]</p>
<p>all right calm down Chiefs fans peace yeah</p>
<p>arrowhead&rsquo;s a tough place for some reason there&rsquo;s something about going</p>
<p>there that I just don&rsquo;t like I don&rsquo;t know why but</p>
<p>I gotta say Arrowhead I actually agree I think it&rsquo;s I think it&rsquo;s the loudest the</p>
<p>loudest place to play I really do so tomorrow I am uh often asked about what</p>
<p>I miss most about playing and my answer since I retired has really never changed</p>
<p>I miss my teammates let&rsquo;s talk about teamwork you talk a lot about your team</p>
<p>your team on the field your team off the field your team of doctors what makes a</p>
<p>good teammate in all three of those categories</p>
<p>um what makes a good teammate in my eyes would be just selflessness not caring</p>
<p>what role that you have just all in for a greater cause or a greater good um you</p>
<p>know that&rsquo;s what it takes to win everybody on the same Mission going to</p>
<p>one goal um and something I said even before or</p>
<p>even right after I got drafted for the bills I said I don&rsquo;t care if I had to be</p>
<p>the the mascot or the water board you know I just want to help the team win</p>
<p>and I meant that my first year just having a small role of playing special</p>
<p>teams in the second year being called upon to be a starter and ultimately</p>
<p>ended up being the leader of the defense um you know no matter what it was I just</p>
<p>want to help the team win I&rsquo;ve always been like that since youth football</p>
<p>league yeah you know in football the quarterback the running back is going to</p>
<p>get a lot of the attention the behind the scenes support staff are so integral</p>
<p>on an NFL team the equipment managers the video directors the athletic</p>
<p>training staff talk about how the Bill&rsquo;s athletic training staff has been so</p>
<p>important you man they have a special place in my heart now for Life they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been so good to me even before my events on the field they just show so</p>
<p>much love so much passion care just the genuineness that they show which is</p>
<p>probably the biggest piece yeah because that&rsquo;s what you can feel in a</p>
<p>relationship from someone when they&rsquo;re really being themselves and they you can</p>
<p>see that they really care about you so um they have a special place in my heart</p>
<p>and I have a lot a lot a lot of giving back to do to them of uh you&rsquo;ve long</p>
<p>served as a pillar of servant leadership always giving back to your community</p>
<p>dating back to your early days as an NFL prospect why is giving back so important</p>
<p>to you you know it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s been in me since I was little</p>
<p>you know just coming from like an underprivileged area not having the most</p>
<p>resources or accessibility to things um you know I&rsquo;ve always wanted to make</p>
<p>it to somewhere to give kids behind me that opportunity and just also watching</p>
<p>my father grow up you know he started AAU leagues for us he started</p>
<p>Community Days for us you know just things to show us that there&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>opportunities in life and you could do you know you could you could do whatever</p>
<p>you want to do um so you know just giving you Limitless opportunities I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s the biggest thing for me yeah and during some of your tough days</p>
<p>you receive love absolutely thank you</p>
<p>during some of your tough times tomorrow you received love and prayers from</p>
<p>millions of people all over the world lots of strangers talk about what that</p>
<p>kind of support means to you you know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a feeling I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even describe it&rsquo;s something I wasn&rsquo;t expecting but you know just getting up</p>
<p>getting that love and the time of need from the world and just seeing the world</p>
<p>having the world see the love that I was given you know from my heart without</p>
<p>without wanting any recognition just trying to do my part it was it was a</p>
<p>good feeling it was a good feeling to have and it just it was like extra</p>
<p>battery charge to to keep going and to do more amen and what do you think you</p>
<p>have learned about yourself through all this</p>
<p>one thing I&rsquo;ve learned is that you know I feel like I&rsquo;ve been doing the right</p>
<p>things I&rsquo;ve been I&rsquo;ve been living the right way</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;ve been standing on the right morals</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>I miss been standing on the right morals and</p>
<p>just you know um that just allows me to just trust my gut trust my heart and</p>
<p>just I don&rsquo;t really have to worry stress or or feel like you know I have to</p>
<p>figure anything out I just I go with whatever my heart tells me and it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>working so far outside of football you&rsquo;re also an</p>
<p>entrepreneur creative director for your brand chasing Millions tell us about</p>
<p>your role on that and what creativity means to you creativity has been</p>
<p>everything to me I think it was something when I was young where I just</p>
<p>everything I did I just wanted to be you know setting a trend or I just didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to be doing something that someone else was doing so and as I got older</p>
<p>into college you know it was kind of like my piece away from the game to</p>
<p>where I can be a normal person I guess you you could</p>
<p>say um so my role I play in that I&rsquo;ve been running the brand since about 2017</p>
<p>I actually had three surgeries my freshman year of college wow yeah sports</p>
<p>hernia surgery so it was like a I didn&rsquo;t know if I was actually going to ever get</p>
<p>my opportunity to to make it to the league because some people don&rsquo;t so I</p>
<p>was it was just being entrepreneurial I Was preparing for that and like okay I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna just start my brand and it was kind of a slogan I was using on the way</p>
<p>all along from high school so I just kind of started the brand there and then</p>
<p>as I got back and started playing I just kept it going</p>
<p>you talked earlier to us about the best piece of advice you received while</p>
<p>pursuing your career in football after this past season what was the best piece</p>
<p>of advice you received that you think helped you out the most during the</p>
<p>season I don&rsquo;t know if I can particularly</p>
<p>specify one thing um but I know it was definitely</p>
<p>um coach McDermott something from coach McDermott</p>
<p>um him just taking the time out of his day personal meetings after</p>
<p>um after practice to just help me develop and help me grow and just him</p>
<p>showing that like he cares and that he trusted me that honestly is bigger than</p>
<p>most things in the world to me yeah yeah it makes you want to play for somebody</p>
<p>like that absolutely</p>
<p>next one all from my congratulations on being named the 2023 NFL PA Allen page</p>
