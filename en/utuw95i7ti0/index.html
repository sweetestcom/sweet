<p>put a towel on when you got other pool</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>the doctor burgers not enough time</p>
<p>obviously in your show for the immense</p>
<p>gratitude that I have and I&rsquo;m sure your</p>
<p>fans care for this incredible show and</p>
<p>all the great work that you and Karen</p>
<p>and your team do so thank you for that</p>
<p>very much</p>
<p>and just so really quick I&rsquo;m 36 a mom</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been starting about Thanksgiving I</p>
<p>was 170 to 170</p>
<p>tinkering you know with intermittent</p>
<p>fasting and my keto diet come today I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>156 pounds since Thanksgiving</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so happy I do have a little bit of a</p>
<p>history of hypertension um I did have</p>
<p>preeclampsia gave birth to a beautiful</p>
<p>Micro preemies super healthy now um no</p>
<p>allergies no medications except for five</p>
<p>milligrams of nor the facts so like I</p>
<p>said I&rsquo;ve been tinkering with it right</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m on 23 one I feel incredible I</p>
<p>have so much energy I feel like I could</p>
<p>you know get home and keep going with</p>
<p>the baby and do everything or just I</p>
<p>feel really great so this is my annual</p>
<p>today about dough like 30 minutes ago I</p>
<p>left my annual with my cardiologist and</p>
<p>you know I thought he&rsquo;d be so happy and</p>
<p>impressed and he was completely against</p>
<p>everything that I&rsquo;m doing that I was</p>
<p>starving myself that this wasn&rsquo;t gonna</p>
<p>work long term thought the sodium to</p>
<p>increase you know continual low-carb</p>
<p>diet but you know some measurement</p>
<p>sodium and then he upped my medication</p>
<p>so I think this is not a long-term</p>
<p>solution to my problem right I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just walk away here with a prescription</p>
<p>right well let me let me respond to that</p>
<p>let me respond to that a couple things</p>
<p>doctors they treat they treat symptoms</p>
<p>they treat disease that&rsquo;s what they do I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t treat disease what I do is I help</p>
<p>people all right shows them how to</p>
<p>create more health</p>
<p>honestly I personally would find another</p>
<p>doctor that actually would work with you</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not so antagonistic s&ndash; is</p>
<p>something that is helping you</p>
<p>unfortunately a lot of doctors are our</p>
<p>fed data from the American Heart</p>
<p>Association which recommends using the -</p>
<p>diet which is very carb heavy low fat</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the same old information</p>
<p>recycled so they just don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>data so you&rsquo;re trying to get information</p>
<p>about health but they&rsquo;re specialized in</p>
<p>medications so what&rsquo;s really missing in</p>
<p>healthcare is the health part they just</p>
<p>not trained on how to get healthy in</p>
<p>fact go to your doctor and ask them come</p>
<p>here I just want to know how can I</p>
<p>improve my health and see what they say</p>
<p>now to be interesting conversation but</p>
<p>as far as blood pressure it sounds like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing great I think you just need</p>
<p>to give it more time because what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen as you reduce insulin by</p>
<p>lowering the carbs and doing in a minute</p>
<p>fasting a lot of things are gonna happen</p>
<p>to the arteries they&rsquo;re gonna become</p>
<p>softer they&rsquo;re not going to be as rigid</p>
<p>because insulin and high sugar makes</p>
<p>them rigid and stiff and</p>
<p>the other thing the couple things you</p>
<p>could do nutrition wise is vitamin k2</p>
<p>and d3 is going to be very beneficial to</p>
<p>help if there&rsquo;s any calcium in the</p>
<p>arteries but the main is going to be</p>
<p>supporting insulin resistance improving</p>
<p>lead sugars and give it more time</p>
<p>because it takes a while for that to</p>
<p>really self correct and so you&rsquo;re giving</p>
<p>the body a chance to really heal so</p>
<p>increase the vegetables you can actually</p>
<p>add a lot more potassium to the diet</p>
<p>because if you calculate on what you</p>
<p>need is like 4700 you might want to go</p>
<p>up to 5,000 maybe 6,000 because and</p>
<p>mostly from food because that potassium</p>
<p>is really great for blood pressure okay</p>
<p>so those are the two things that I would</p>
<p>recommend thanks for calling navel we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go to Derrick from New York where</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s nice and warm up there hi Derrick</p>
<p>how you doing</p>
<p>good morning dr. Burke how are you good</p>
<p>morning</p>
<p>and dr. Burke thank you for all the all</p>
<p>the insight that you you know give</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands of people we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>all very grateful I know there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of people so I&rsquo;m just gonna dive right</p>
<p>in into it dr. Berg you&rsquo;ve been helping</p>
<p>me actually with a lot of things that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been going through I had sludge it</p>
<p>I have sludge in the gallbladder I</p>
<p>mentioned this last time a height of</p>
<p>skin that was 49% ejection fraction that</p>
<p>was just two and a half weeks ago you</p>
<p>told me to go on if&rsquo; but I do have Jill</p>
<p>bear syndrome and my bilirubin is now</p>
<p>much higher than it was</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking acid I&rsquo;ll 300 milligrams</p>
<p>twice a day I have acute gastritis and</p>
<p>basically minimal erosive nasaw</p>
<p>minimally Rozsival the duodenum as well</p>
<p>as my esophagus I stopped doing I have</p>
<p>some GERD so uh based on your videos I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>pretty sure that I&rsquo;m I lack</p>
<p>stomach acid and bile</p>
<p>so I stopped doing the apple cider</p>
<p>vinegar because and lemon because I kind</p>
<p>of I don&rsquo;t know how that&rsquo;s gonna be on</p>
<p>my stomach with inflammation</p>
<p>also have apt gas and low ayran ayran is</p>
<p>like 46 low b12</p>
<p>low vitamin D and I&rsquo;m assuming low</p>
<p>vitamin A and low vitamin K okay and I</p>
<p>also don&rsquo;t know what eat throughout the</p>
<p>day I&rsquo;ve been eating just a lot of salad</p>
<p>but I steamed it due to the do to do so</p>
<p>the inflammation of the stomach because</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want it to be raw and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m just eating some olive oil on it</p>
<p>and some and some meat whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>organic chicken meat</p>
<p>organic salmon but I&rsquo;m not trying to do</p>
<p>the salmon all the time but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really my go-to food I don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>else to do okay so let me just kind of</p>
<p>give you some tips on this Derek</p>
<p>or something like that you have a</p>
<p>corrosion of your stomach you have a lot</p>
<p>of irritation so you can&rsquo;t really put</p>
<p>the acid down there to help you absorb</p>
<p>the iron and the b12 and you need the</p>
<p>assets release the bile salts which I</p>
<p>think you said you&rsquo;re taking by</p>
<p>ourselves so all that&rsquo;s going to help</p>
<p>you so you&rsquo;re kind of in this transition</p>
<p>of getting your body healed intimate of</p>
<p>fasting it&rsquo;s going to it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>eventually help you but it you have a</p>
<p>condition where it&rsquo;s going to be a long</p>
<p>term process to get your body go through</p>
<p>the process of healing but as far as</p>
<p>what to eat you&rsquo;re going to have to kind</p>
<p>of cope right now because you&rsquo;re stuck</p>
<p>between a rock and a hard place you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t dump the acid in there now so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to steam your</p>
<p>vegetables have a little fat and then</p>
<p>just give it more time</p>
<p>the other thing that I would recommend</p>
<p>is cabbage different types of cabbage</p>
<p>things like fermented cabbage try that</p>
<p>steamed cabbage maybe even a little bit</p>
<p>of raw cabbage cabbage has a unique</p>
<p>factor something natural in there that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really good for ulcers in gastritis and</p>
<p>inflammation of the stomach</p>
<p>it sounds to me that you had a pretty</p>
<p>bad</p>
<p>blood sugar issue at one time and that</p>
<p>can also create a problem with the</p>
<p>nervous system in the stomach it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called the autonomic nervous system I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s called their autonomic</p>
<p>neuropathy basically where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting this nerve damage to the organs</p>
<p>too so you might have some of that so</p>
<p>the solution is try keep doing in a</p>
<p>minute fasting and because gonna let</p>
<p>your body go through a process of etapa</p>
<p>G and that&rsquo;s going to actually start</p>
<p>healing your inside of your skin</p>
<p>wheatgrass juice is essential because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really good to actually support</p>
<p>the lining on the internal part of your</p>
<p>body so I think I&rsquo;m just you think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing everything right you just</p>
<p>got to give it more time and until</p>
<p>eventually you can add the acid back in</p>
<p>okay all right do we have a question</p>
<p>Karen yes good okay so um there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>question here from someone that is</p>
<p>wondering what a nicotine supplement</p>
<p>will do to intermittent fasting</p>
<p>okay so you talked about the patch it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just a supplement that I assume I mean</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gum there&rsquo;s a patch yeah good</p>
<p>question so nicotine</p>
<p>you know it but what it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>stimulate something called the</p>
<p>sympathetic nervous system and if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>too much it can actually raise</p>
<p>epinephrine adrenaline and that can</p>
<p>release some sugar in the system and</p>
<p>then increase the insulin okay so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of what you&rsquo;re looking at so what</p>
<p>you could do is just try to do it the</p>
<p>minimal amount possible but I like the</p>
<p>fact that you&rsquo;re doing nicotine instead</p>
<p>of the actual smoking because then you</p>
<p>can avoid all the chemicals so it can</p>
<p>depending on how much you&rsquo;re exposed to</p>
<p>yeah good okay I have another one okay</p>
<p>okay so I have Elena from Facebook and</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s saying that she knows she has an</p>
<p>awful lot of stress in her life that her</p>
<p>adrenals are probably trashed she&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>on the program since September she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>lost a few pounds but she wants to know</p>
<p>how long can it take for her adrenals to</p>
<p>heal and to see more weight loss it</p>
<p>really depends on how chronic it is or</p>
<p>how bad it is and it&rsquo;s hard to tell I</p>
<p>excuse me I think one of the best</p>
<p>indicators for adrenal is that climbing</p>
<p>up stairs or going up a incline because</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not if you climb up an incline</p>
<p>and you feel like completely out of</p>
<p>breath real fast then we know the</p>
<p>adrenals are are kind of weak so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>several things that you&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>to do on a regular basis overall maybe</p>
<p>several months to start healing the</p>
<p>adrenal the biggest thing is to do</p>
<p>everything possible nutrient wise food</p>
<p>acupressure you can find on my website</p>
<p>to help your sleep because the sleep is</p>
<p>really really key into helping the</p>
<p>adrenals there&rsquo;s some great things that</p>
<p>you can take nutritionally one is called</p>
<p>cortisol adrenal course all relief I</p>
<p>think that gives you the nutrients for</p>
<p>the adrenals and then the acupressure</p>
<p>those two I think will be helpful but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to you know give it</p>
<p>some months to actually reverse that</p>
<p>okay hey real quick I wanted to tell you</p>
<p>guys we have a really cool new community</p>
<p>group on Facebook it&rsquo;s called ketogenic</p>
<p>M and fasting a lab where we actually do</p>
<p>testing on people no I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>we do different experiments and share</p>
<p>our results with each other so</p>
<p>you can go to Facebook and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a link I think on the top of the</p>
<p>page somewhere on the page and you can</p>
<p>sign up and if the close group will</p>
<p>invite you in but there&rsquo;s a couple</p>
<p>guidelines in and mainly this group is</p>
<p>to help us share with each other</p>
<p>successful actions so we can learn</p>
<p>things from each other and help each</p>
<p>other it&rsquo;s not meant for promotional</p>
<p>actions or affiliate links so if you</p>
<p>have that you can&rsquo;t do that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>against the rules or if you&rsquo;re promoting</p>
<p>product or go to this page or some other</p>
<p>diet</p>
<p>got to be nice no a bad language okay</p>
<p>Charles no trolls welcome we delete you</p>
<p>and we just want to know what&rsquo;s working</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s not working and we can share</p>
<p>experiences I&rsquo;ll be posting some really</p>
<p>cool little tests that we can do just</p>
<p>like if you have a blood sugar</p>
<p>testing thing or a keto testing maybe</p>
<p>you can help us to see how your blood</p>
<p>Sugar&rsquo;s or ketones are affected after</p>
<p>you eat like I don&rsquo;t know a pound of ice</p>
<p>cream or or whatever or avocados will</p>
<p>present some really cool tests and then</p>
<p>we can see the results and I&rsquo;ll be doing</p>
<p>a periodic live events as well and I</p>
<p>want to mention if you wanted to sign up</p>
<p>on that you can go to the Facebook okay</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go take a question from Raj I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s raw Raja from</p>
<p>Carolina yes</p>
<p>yes sir well hello dr. Berg I thank you</p>
<p>for taking my call I&rsquo;m a really fan of</p>
<p>your content you really provide a great</p>
<p>insight that is very useful and</p>
<p>effective I&rsquo;m a vegetarian I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>160 pounds I&rsquo;m a 56 year old I am a</p>
<p>renal body type so I&rsquo;ve taken your night</p>
<p>time formula and that is up quite a bit</p>
<p>I also hyperlipidemia diabetes</p>
<p>hypertension</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using diet and intermittent fasting</p>
<p>this year and it does have quite a bit</p>
<p>in I&rsquo;m not taking diabetic meds anymore</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s under control my even see is</p>
<p>five point four and so I&rsquo;m really happy</p>
<p>about that</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d like to find out cause of</p>
<p>hypertension so I&rsquo;m kind of</p>
<p>going about the looking as though I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not taking any salt I&rsquo;ve taken salt</p>
<p>substitutes I&rsquo;m taking potassium like</p>
<p>you said I&rsquo;m balancing between</p>
<p>potassium and</p>
<p>sodium ratio always but I&rsquo;m more leaning</p>
<p>towards potassium so but my hypertension</p>
<p>causes is not so I&rsquo;ve been into</p>
<p>nutrition deficiency and all that and I</p>
<p>found that I&rsquo;m b12 you know so when I</p>
<p>take nutrition East that you strongly</p>
<p>recommend in the past years but I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>taken it my won&rsquo;t my eyes sink in like</p>
<p>this shrink to pull it and then the</p>
<p>outside of the eyes a pure little black</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I should be concerned</p>
<p>about that they&rsquo;re not paying for</p>
<p>anything but they&rsquo;re noticeably make me</p>
<p>look like an ni person</p>
<p>so a you know I&rsquo;m but so but I but that</p>
<p>does happen if I take</p>
<p>the b12 tablets but I don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>well I&rsquo;m absorbing b12 okay right now</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s and my other question was about</p>
<p>okay yeah let&rsquo;s talk about that because</p>
<p>I have a lot of questions so probably</p>
<p>one question per person that would be</p>
<p>wonderful if you get an actual</p>
<p>nutritional yeast powder</p>
<p>unfortunately it doesn&rsquo;t come with b12</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s added in that&rsquo;s and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>added them sometimes add in</p>
<p>synthetically that&rsquo;s one of the reasons</p>
<p>why I created the nutritional yeast</p>
<p>tablets because I added some natural b12</p>
<p>in there so that way of the whole thing</p>
<p>so when you take</p>
<p>nutritional yeast with all those B</p>
<p>vitamins without the b12 potentially it</p>
<p>can create more of an exaggerated effect</p>
<p>of b12 deficiency which could affect</p>
<p>those eyes so what I would do is I would</p>
<p>either get the powder add some natural</p>
<p>b12 and that should Hamlet or you can</p>
<p>get the tablets that I have it&rsquo;s up to</p>
<p>you but with you I think you need to add</p>
<p>a little bit more apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>with water and lemon to drink that</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;ll start to help the</p>
<p>absorption of b12 to the stomach because</p>
<p>you need acid so especially if you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>vegetarian</p>
<p>the challenge with being a vegetarian is</p>
<p>getting the b12 believe it or not the</p>
<p>wheatgrass juice powder I have</p>
<p>has it in it we tested it which is</p>
<p>surprising because normally we</p>
<p>Crestridge doesn&rsquo;t have it but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>added with the microbes head then it</p>
<p>comes with it&rsquo;s actually double the RDAs</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s really what you&rsquo;re running</p>
<p>into the key vitamins that you need to</p>
<p>focus on being a vegetarian are the iron</p>
<p>the b12 and the vitamin A because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard to get that in being a vegan but</p>
<p>good question hey Gerald you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>Chicago you had a question about pH</p>
<p>testing</p>
<p>yes sir</p>
<p>and related questions about evaluation</p>
<p>first of all I want to thank you for the</p>
<p>great explanations you provide I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>everyone appreciates what you do my</p>
<p>question is is it a good idea to use</p>
<p>hydrogen pH test strips to know your pH</p>
<p>level good awesome great question</p>
<p>because pH is a huge confusing topic</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna measure your saliva and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna check your urine that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty much all you can tell a test your</p>
<p>body has all different PHS then what it</p>
<p>centers around is your blood pH when you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t test it with a pH paper you have</p>
<p>to go get it injected pulled out and</p>
<p>then the objective it pulled it out and</p>
<p>then quickly test it but it turns it</p>
<p>oxidizes so fast so it&rsquo;s really hard to</p>
<p>test your blood pH but you can go by</p>
<p>symptoms however there is some benefit</p>
<p>to checking the urine pH and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>couple things you have to realize though</p>
<p>the urine pH does not really tell you</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on with the rest of the</p>
<p>body for example if you&rsquo;re losing</p>
<p>stomach acid your pH of your urine might</p>
<p>initially be very high in acids so it</p>
<p>could be more acid so you really have to</p>
<p>kind of look at the whole body but what</p>
<p>I like to use the pH strips are for its</p>
<p>checking the urine especially when when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing keto to</p>
<p>evaluate maybe if you&rsquo;re too alkaline</p>
<p>for example you need to certify the body</p>
<p>and that could be from an adrenal issue</p>
<p>or even diabetes however if your pH is</p>
<p>the opposite Institute acid because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing keto and you&rsquo;re dumping a</p>
<p>lot of ketones through the urine and you</p>
<p>have gout for example gout symptoms</p>
<p>which is high uric acid then you better</p>
<p>start taking some calcium or some maybe</p>
<p>potassium citrate to kind of chill that</p>
<p>out and so I would use it mainly to kind</p>
<p>of get an idea of what&rsquo;s going on with</p>
<p>your</p>
<p>maybe kidney stones or gout because both</p>
<p>of those conditions are usually</p>
<p>especially we&rsquo;re doing keto too much</p>
<p>uric acid so that pH should be more</p>
<p>acidic so that&rsquo;s I think that would be</p>
<p>the most useful thing that would use pH</p>
<p>strips but good questions your hell</p>
<p>thanks for asking that now let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>Karen hey good okay so over YouTube here</p>
<p>I have</p>
<p>mark who is asking</p>
<p>he says how do you get seven hundred</p>
<p>forty seven hundred milligrams of</p>
<p>potassium</p>
<p>when potassium tablets are only</p>
<p>100 milligrams okay mark another good</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s how they sell it but you it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re gonna get this from</p>
<p>a supplement you want to try to get it</p>
<p>from your foods that&rsquo;s the whole goal</p>
<p>in my book which most of you have I have</p>
<p>a chart on potassium on page 122 okay</p>
<p>and I list all the foods that have high</p>
<p>potassium and low potassium and I wanted</p>
<p>to I wanted to explain something because</p>
<p>he if for example</p>
<p>banana has 400 maybe 3 to 400 milligrams</p>
<p>of potassium but you need a lot of those</p>
<p>potassium so a lot of bananas to get</p>
<p>your daily requirements but if we come</p>
<p>down here to</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say Brussels sprouts it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>500 avocados are almost 900 milligrams</p>
<p>so this basically tells us that we</p>
<p>naturally our diet needs to be high and</p>
<p>vegetable but also protein for other but</p>
<p>nutrients but if you try to get your</p>
<p>potassium from supplements you&rsquo;re only</p>
<p>looking at one nutrient out of a whole</p>
<p>bunch of them and it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>throw something else out you want to use</p>
<p>extra calcium from supplements as an</p>
<p>enhancement but not as a way to get to</p>
<p>your IDE your ideal seen with potassium</p>
<p>and this is one of the problems that</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t like eating vegetables so</p>
<p>they I&rsquo;m just gonna get it from a pill</p>
<p>now I do have electrolyte powder for</p>
<p>some enhancement but it has all the</p>
<p>electrolytes and trace minerals with no</p>
<p>sugar so that couldn&rsquo;t be a little bit</p>
<p>better than just taking a pill the</p>
<p>problem with buying potassium citrate</p>
<p>from a powder is it&rsquo;s very hard to get</p>
<p>down unless you put some some other</p>
<p>things in it so it&rsquo;s like you probably</p>
<p>start gagging so I would start consuming</p>
<p>more salads to get your potassium and</p>
<p>not trying to take the pill 299</p>
<p>milligram pill hey let&rsquo;s go to Lisa from</p>
<p>Pennsylvania you had a question about</p>
<p>magnesium go ahead</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if from he</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t hear me right but my question was</p>
<p>about a nickel and aluminum toxicity on</p>
<p>hair analysis boy okay so so like hot I</p>
<p>had a couple I had a couple other</p>
<p>questions I mentioned numbness in the</p>
<p>extremities with magnesium citrate to</p>
<p>help increase or not my medium I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably where the confusion came</p>
<p>in the tascam citrate I&rsquo;m trying to</p>
<p>supplement with potassium citrate to</p>
<p>increase my potassium and when I do I</p>
<p>get numbness in the extremities</p>
<p>when I add to b12 in there it seems to</p>
<p>help but I</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t sure if that was the root of the</p>
<p>problem with that okay</p>
<p>okay so let&rsquo;s just answer that list I</p>
<p>think if you have like heavy metals in</p>
<p>your hair you got to find out what is</p>
<p>causing that what didn&rsquo;t you what are</p>
<p>you eating that&rsquo;s causing that there are</p>
<p>natural things you can get to help the</p>
<p>store that are called key leaders</p>
<p>incubator it means like to hook</p>
<p>something you can take them like one is</p>
<p>chlorella for example and you take it</p>
<p>and it starts pulling out some of the</p>
<p>heavy metals you want to get the lead</p>
<p>out I&rsquo;m sorry the copper out and and</p>
<p>nickel and whatever you have in your</p>
<p>body so you want to pull it out that way</p>
<p>and trying to find out what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>that could be exposing your body to that</p>
<p>and then you also had a question that I</p>
<p>completely and utterly forgot so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna ask you again</p>
<p>you were asking</p>
<p>just to help you out with your nickel</p>
<p>toxicity I believe it&rsquo;s coming from</p>
<p>dental capsules okay another question</p>
<p>right after that</p>
<p>yes numbness in the extremities with</p>
<p>potassium citrate supplement yeah you</p>
<p>said you said potassium not calcium</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>correct okay alright so here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some interesting things about</p>
<p>numbness and your extremities you can</p>
<p>have numbness if your pH is too far one</p>
<p>way or the other you can have numbness</p>
<p>if you have too much calcium in your</p>
<p>body so if you take too much minerals as</p>
<p>an individual mineral and you get</p>
<p>numbness it could probably be throwing</p>
<p>something else out</p>
<p>but typically numbness is a blood sugar</p>
<p>thing when you have insulin resistance</p>
<p>pre-diabetes and also and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>diabetic gets peripheral neuropathy so</p>
<p>what I would do is i if you&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>something else and you get some symptom</p>
<p>I would back up and go okay how can I</p>
<p>take this more in a complex or how</p>
<p>nature has provided it versus one</p>
<p>specific nutrient because even when you</p>
<p>get a nutrition anytime you take one of</p>
<p>something out of the natural complex</p>
<p>that normally doesn&rsquo;t come in nature you</p>
<p>might throw something out and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even know why you&rsquo;re getting that but I</p>
<p>would just start getting</p>
<p>more food based type minerals or</p>
<p>elements or vitamins okay but take a key</p>
<p>later I think that&rsquo;ll be important and</p>
<p>as far as the dental stuff you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>probably gonna have to take chlorella</p>
<p>for a period of time thanks Lisa all</p>
<p>right Karen</p>
<p>yeah we got to represent here on social</p>
<p>media I have two good questions from</p>
<p>YouTube I have Ollie who&rsquo;s asking what</p>
<p>causes a lot of burping okay okay so</p>
<p>burping is usually gallbladder and the</p>
<p>gallbladder is</p>
<p>you know backing up with some gas so</p>
<p>anytime you burp belch or bloat that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>gallbladder symptoms so you want to find</p>
<p>out what you&rsquo;re eating you want to do is</p>
<p>maybe some acupressure on the</p>
<p>gallbladder possibly some nutrition I</p>
<p>have a lot of videos in the gallbladder</p>
<p>you could probably watch that okay okay</p>
<p>good another one is from and I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>if I mispronounce this Carice on</p>
<p>YouTube and she says she&rsquo;s having a</p>
<p>difficult time digesting fats and carbs</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m not sure what kind of carbs</p>
<p>since we&rsquo;re trying to avoid carbs but</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s asking that liquids do a lot</p>
<p>better could she do just liquids</p>
<p>and the fasting doing intermittent</p>
<p>fasting yeah well if you&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>problems is probably some sluggishness</p>
<p>with the gallbladder and yes you can do</p>
<p>liquid stuff but you don&rsquo;t want to do</p>
<p>carbs with fats you don&rsquo;t want to do</p>
<p>carbs with protein unless it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>vegetable carbohydrate but yeah if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re having digestive issues do the at</p>
<p>the end of the day you just have to make</p>
<p>sure that you get all your nutrients so</p>
<p>you can liquefy your salad you can</p>
<p>liquefy your fats you can liquefy your</p>
<p>hamburger for example just put into a</p>
<p>shake and drink it down hey I want to go</p>
<p>to a call because someone&rsquo;s been on the</p>
<p>line for 47 minutes Aalto you&rsquo;re on the</p>
<p>line from Salt Lake City you go ahead</p>
<p>hi how are you greetings from Utah great</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t eat vegetables so I</p>
<p>cannot go on a keto diet as others</p>
<p>normally would but I have started doing</p>
<p>intermittent fasting</p>
<p>with eating only twice a day my calorie</p>
<p>count has decreased drastically so what</p>
<p>I want to know is is it a good idea to</p>
<p>do intermittent fasting seven days a</p>
<p>week and what should I do in order to</p>
<p>have this lifestyle to be sustainable</p>
<p>and what to do to avoid slowing my</p>
<p>metabolism when my body adapted to my</p>
<p>meals okay good so there&rsquo;s a couple</p>
<p>things yes you can do in a minute</p>
<p>fasting every single day I think I would</p>
<p>recommend it but if you don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>vegetables there is one food that you</p>
<p>could eat one category of food that</p>
<p>actually has</p>
<p>almost the equivalent of nutrients to</p>
<p>vegetables and if anyone can actually</p>
<p>take a wild guess right now and type it</p>
<p>in I would like to see your opinion of</p>
<p>what do you think has more nutrients</p>
<p>than vegetables go ahead type it in oh I</p>
<p>know and I know you know but what about</p>
<p>is anyone can you tell me if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>anyone that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>typing anything in that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s even close to being correct no</p>

<p>things like wheatgrass juice powder eggs</p>
<p>red meat but it seems like sorry</p>
<p>Facebook the YouTube guys</p>
<p>getting a lot more of the correct answer</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you like that when you ask a</p>
<p>question and the teacher asking good no</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong are</p>
<p>you half right you let me just tell you</p>
<p>what it is</p>
<p>basically organ meats yeah</p>
<p>okay there we have it that was no little</p>
<p>anticlimactic no say more about that</p>
<p>yeah I&rsquo;m gonna yeah you want to get</p>
<p>grass-fed there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a website</p>
<p>that has grass-fed I can&rsquo;t remember the</p>
<p>name of it but the point is you can find</p>
<p>online you can get this but you can</p>
<p>grasp it liverwurst you can gret grasp</p>
<p>it and their organ meats</p>
<p>personally I have a hard time consuming</p>
<p>them but if you wanted to if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like vegetables you then you&rsquo;re stuck</p>
<p>with organ meats make sure it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>grass-fed make sure it&rsquo;s organic but</p>
<p>that Believe It or Not has all the fat</p>
<p>soluble vitamins tons of minerals tons</p>
<p>of potassium vitamin C</p>
<p>so basically that&rsquo;s your other option if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t like vegetables you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have to have organ meats and you can and</p>
<p>fast put it in your blender yes and you</p>
<p>can take it with a stroll the organ</p>
<p>ematic thanks Ulta hey done you&rsquo;re from</p>

<p>dr. Berg thank you Happy New Year</p>
<p>December Happy New Year on December</p>
<p>little pipe out of surgery I&rsquo;m a retired</p>
<p>firefighter paramedic in Miami been</p>
<p>retired 15 months love fire president</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>firefighters</p>
<p>definitely a wonderful bunch of guys and</p>
<p>girls doing first responder work with</p>
<p>wonderful sensitivity I&rsquo;m presently</p>
<p>taking your apple cider vinegar kale</p>
<p>parsley and beet top shake with</p>
<p>wheatgrass</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lost 32 pounds since my October 4th</p>
<p>journey into</p>
<p>quadruple bypass surgery and you can</p>
<p>imagine how I feel about I was a</p>
<p>marathon or triathlon or a</p>
<p>chicken</p>
<p>fish and Turkey all the time so you can</p>
<p>imagine how I feel about putting fat</p>
<p>into my body right now after having this</p>
<p>kind of background so my question for</p>
<p>you today is my wife is on a ketogenic</p>
<p>diet and I can&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ve been on a</p>
<p>plant-based diet since really the</p>
<p>operation but how does a keto check and</p>
<p>also I&rsquo;m type two diabetic that is why</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get off a meta Foreman so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve lost 32 pounds and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going down further how will a ketogenic</p>
<p>diet reduce my cholesterol and blood</p>
<p>sugar levels as opposed to the</p>
<p>plant-based diet yeah okay so very good</p>
<p>question down there&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m trying to give</p>
<p>you the short version of that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of videos I have on this one topic</p>
<p>the truth is that the cholesterol that</p>
<p>is in your arteries</p>
<p>only 10% comes from the diet 90% of it</p>
<p>is coming from your own body your body&rsquo;s</p>
<p>making cholesterol so it&rsquo;s really not</p>
<p>the villain it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s at the crime</p>
<p>scene which is in the arteries but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>trying to heal something else going on</p>
<p>now if you have insulin resistance you</p>
<p>have</p>
<p>pre-diabetic you have higher levels of</p>
<p>insulin and that&rsquo;s one thing you should</p>
<p>probably check go get a fasting insulin</p>
<p>test it&rsquo;s going to be a little higher</p>
<p>but and that&rsquo;s really what&rsquo;s corroding</p>
<p>and attacking the lining the epithelial</p>
<p>lining of your arteries and creating a</p>
<p>cascade of effects of the cholesterol in</p>
<p>the protein coming in the calcium coming</p>
<p>in and then forming a plaque or a clot</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really what&rsquo;s going on so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not the fat that is going to heal you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really the low carbs I love the</p>
<p>fact that Ewing a plant-based diet I</p>
<p>think you should consume actual plants</p>
<p>vegetation like like a whole bunch of it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I recommend but I think I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be afraid also to add some high</p>
<p>quality protein in there with that comes</p>
<p>naturally with that that that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going to be a problem for your arteries</p>
<p>at all in fact them they found that when</p>
<p>you go low-fat protein it spikes insulin</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re trying to get insulin down so I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be afraid of doing that</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s like let&rsquo;s say five</p>
<p>ounces per meal and you do in a minute</p>
<p>fasting you&rsquo;re gonna find very quickly</p>
<p>that your insulin is gonna come down</p>
<p>your your heart&rsquo;s gonna heal your blood</p>
<p>blood sugar is gonna heal a lot better</p>
<p>so really it&rsquo;s kind of like shifting</p>
<p>your attention that what really messes</p>
<p>people up is the refined carbs and the</p>
<p>sugars and that type of thing so again</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t absolutely don&rsquo;t want to do</p>
<p>animal products well then you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have to really find some other proteins</p>
<p>and fats that can give you the nutrients</p>
<p>that you need it&rsquo;s very hard to intimate</p>
<p>of fasting on a low-fat diet because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re gonna be really hungry</p>
<p>and and it&rsquo;s really hard so and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also nutrients that you need like</p>
<p>vitamin A vitamin D vitamin E that</p>
<p>naturally come from fats so but study</p>
<p>some more videos on that I have a lot of</p>
<p>data online about that but thanks done</p>
<p>for being a firefighter and and</p>
<p>answering the question okay Karen we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go to you for a question okay good</p>
<p>and thanks again for the firefighters</p>
<p>dr. Berg knows I love him he like if I</p>
<p>see a firefighter in full uniform</p>
<p>there are my gosh you&rsquo;re hero I yeah</p>
<p>okay okay focus focus okay coming back</p>
<p>to the question right so a two-part</p>
<p>question here from Rosa on Facebook and</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s saying she took the the quiz the</p>
<p>body type quiz and she&rsquo;s 62 percent</p>
<p>adrenal and she&rsquo;s sixteen percent</p>
<p>thyroid she wants to know how to</p>
<p>approach that with regard to supplements</p>
<p>or the diet and also she&rsquo;s wondering</p>
<p>should she could she continued her</p>
<p>multivitamin that she&rsquo;s been taking</p>
<p>okay so it really depends on</p>
<p>multivitamin if it&rsquo;s in synthetic</p>
<p>vitamin or it&rsquo;s a food base you want to</p>
<p>go with food base now the complexities</p>
<p>of the body types in my first book</p>
<p>called the seven fat burning which this</p>
<p>is an upgrade really had people in the</p>
<p>confusion of because we&rsquo;re like well I</p>
<p>have a little combination of this</p>
<p>combination of that in this book which</p>
<p>you may want to consider getting there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a everyone goes on a basic eating plan</p>
<p>okay and that&rsquo;s in chapter I think 11 or</p>
<p>yeah 11 so you basically get on this</p>
<p>plan for a couple weeks then what you do</p>
<p>is you there&rsquo;s a little quiz in there</p>
<p>that tells you let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re more</p>
<p>adrenal or more thyroid or you&rsquo;re tied</p>
<p>it tells you what to do to enhance your</p>
<p>basic eating plan with adjusting the</p>
<p>fats and the</p>
<p>the proteins and the carbs but here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the thing if you&rsquo;re a complete split tie</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know what to do just pick the</p>
<p>adrenals first and go with that and then</p>
<p>what you can do is see how you feel by</p>
<p>adjusting your eating plan if you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>really winning go to the thyroid and try</p>
<p>those recommendations but the way that</p>
<p>you got to look at this is that all</p>
<p>these glands are connected the entire</p>
<p>endocrine system you could almost look</p>
<p>like it at a as a one organism that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>connected on a chain and when one goes</p>
<p>down they all tend to go down so just by</p>
<p>supporting one part of the endocrine</p>
<p>system you&rsquo;re going to support the whole</p>
<p>thing but if you have a little more</p>
<p>Authority you need a little bit more of</p>
<p>this if you&rsquo;re more adrenal you need a</p>
<p>little bit more of that but I think if</p>
<p>you give me a choice between adrenal</p>
<p>thyroid I ought to go with the adrenal</p>
<p>okay Anita you&rsquo;re from Syracuse you two</p>
<p>question go ahead</p>
<p>yes hi happy new year</p>
<p>my question is I keep hearing about lazy</p>
<p>keto carb cycling and carb up days and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of confusing me yeah I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>doing the ketogenic diet for five months</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lost 45 pounds Wow I want to keep</p>
<p>going but I feel like I feel like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>losing gas I feel like I&rsquo;m losing not</p>
<p>interest but I feel like can I keep</p>
<p>doing this I mean I have 50 more pounds</p>
<p>to go I&rsquo;m feel very happy where I&rsquo;m at</p>
<p>right now I have more energy I workout</p>
<p>three days a week I&rsquo;m doing some of the</p>
<p>suggestions that you said about</p>
<p>exercises but I just want to know is</p>
<p>this something that I should explore or</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your thought okay good question</p>
<p>of the whole carb cycling honestly I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;ll slow you down because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s minute that you start adding the</p>
<p>carbs the insulin goes up so now you</p>
<p>bumps you out of ketosis you you&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s very successful the</p>
<p>last thing you want to do is change it</p>
<p>now the thing is like you feel like well</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like how long could I do this it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of could be boring or a routine and</p>
<p>very structured well if you have more</p>
<p>weight to lose keep doing the things</p>
<p>that got you there don&rsquo;t change anything</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna violate the rule that it</p>
<p>something&rsquo;s working you stick with it so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my recommendation on that add</p>
<p>some more interesting recipes or yeah</p>
<p>you can make it more interesting we have</p>
<p>desserts recipes on the site but let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say you hit your goal and you really are</p>
<p>happy with your weight and you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>strengthened and you&rsquo;ve eliminated the</p>
<p>insulin resistance and now you got a</p>
<p>greater level of health you have more</p>
<p>flexibility of going off and doing</p>
<p>different things</p>
<p>because you know that you can go right</p>
<p>back on because you&rsquo;re your insulin is a</p>
<p>lot better so when you build up your</p>
<p>health to a state of a higher level you</p>
<p>have the capacity and the luxury of not</p>
<p>being perfect and</p>
<p>but right now I think I&rsquo;ll stick with it</p>
<p>the other thing about on that on the</p>
<p>internet there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>suggestions I know this might be hard to</p>
<p>believe about every possible viewpoint</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t even know if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting the right thing anyone can say</p>
<p>anything about practically anything and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the problem with the internet</p>
<p>like right now there&rsquo;s some if you type</p>
<p>on and the internet what&rsquo;s the number</p>
<p>one ranked diet it&rsquo;ll say the - diet by</p>
<p>the US News and World Report which is</p>
<p>the media group which I don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>how they&rsquo;re rating this good - diet</p>
<p>because if you take a look at the - diet</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s like between 6 &amp; 8 servings</p>
<p>of grains okay now how is that gonna</p>
<p>actually help you by adding more grains</p>
<p>in there low fat proteins it&rsquo;s just the</p>
<p>same old same old recycled they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>allowing hidden sugars in there they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>allowing a little small amount of candy</p>
<p>but low fat it&rsquo;s just the same thing we</p>
<p>cycled</p>
<p>unfortunately you know you read that and</p>
<p>you go wow is that true well if you know</p>
<p>the basics you&rsquo;re not gonna fall for it</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d like to know how they are</p>
<p>evaluating that diet is it based on</p>
<p>results or how many advertising they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>advertising they have I mean it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>a it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not an independent study</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s very it&rsquo;s been very political</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>Karen do you have another question Oh</p>
<p>someone here&rsquo;s asking if we would do a</p>
<p>food vlog I like that look not just the</p>
<p>recipes because we do the recipes but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re saying hey what about just doing</p>
<p>you know talking about food I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>is it boring we just hear and talk about</p>
<p>food but maybe not maybe we&rsquo;ll look at</p>
<p>that but</p>
<p>thank you for that suggestion and also</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re recommending dr. Berg that you</p>
<p>buy fireman outfit and I think that that</p>
<p>also is a very good suggestion but you</p>
<p>want to tell people about the cheat or</p>
<p>should I why don&rsquo;t you tell me about the</p>
<p>cheat sheet so</p>
<p>Jay you just broke the illusion that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in like two different countries or</p>
<p>something</p>
<p>anyway yeah you can get this if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on YouTube there&rsquo;s a link you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to type in cheat there&rsquo;s actually a link</p>
<p>on youtube if you look below for the</p>
<p>facebook messenger folks type in the</p>
<p>word cheat see h-e-a-t and you will</p>
<p>automatically get that okay so if you</p>
<p>missed that early on that&rsquo;s what you do</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a neat little cheat sheet</p>
<p>okay and</p>
<p>okay good and that was my commercial</p>
<p>okay all right let&rsquo;s go to Leah she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>from Chicago she&rsquo;s been waiting for 24</p>
<p>hours a minute I&rsquo;m just kidding Ilia</p>
<p>hi I&rsquo;m dr. Boyd can you hear me yeah I</p>
<p>can hear you fine I</p>
<p>thank you so much for sharing your</p>
<p>information with us you have helped me</p>
<p>get rid of my insulin resistance I&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>experiment and a couple of other</p>
<p>medically medications are after your</p>
<p>suggestion I even I took them off so I</p>
<p>had PCOS and long hair fall so when I</p>
<p>did my last ultrasound</p>
<p>I still have twisting my left ovaries</p>
<p>and there is some regrowth after I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing intermittent fasting and low to</p>
<p>moderate cards</p>
<p>so low to moderate carb so I still have</p>
<p>cysts in my ovaries and I do see like I</p>
<p>need to regrow my hair a lot you know I</p>
<p>lost like 60 70 percent of my hair so</p>
<p>the thinking which obvious up lemons can</p>
<p>I take I was looking at actual estrogen</p>
<p>balance here formula</p>
<p>wheatgrass and electrolyte you know so</p>
<p>do I need trace minerals as well or</p>
<p>these should be good good question Lea</p>
<p>yeah so let&rsquo;s talk about that I think</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re doing great and by the way</p>
<p>if anyone wants to get off the</p>
<p>medication or get rid of the diseases</p>
<p>realize that all I&rsquo;m doing is I&rsquo;m trying</p>
<p>to build up your health so you can avoid</p>
<p>those things but I&rsquo;m not making any</p>
<p>claims to cure your disease go to the</p>
<p>medical doctor for that but that being</p>
<p>said I think the best thing for cysts to</p>
<p>improve the nutrition of the of the body</p>
<p>and help with that would be the seek</p>
<p>help the icelandic seek help because the</p>
<p>iodine in there is great for cysts on</p>
<p>the ovaries and cysts and the breast the</p>
<p>estrogen balance that I have is really</p>
<p>good for estrogen dominance which also</p>
<p>will help that but it but you if you</p>
<p>have a very specific thing like that I</p>
<p>think all you need is some iodine but</p>
<p>but then the question would be why do</p>
<p>you have in the first place and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very hard to find iodine in</p>
<p>our food nowadays in fact we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>getting the trace minerals we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>getting zinc anymore and that sets us up</p>
<p>for all sorts of problems with</p>
<p>detoxification</p>
<p>especially zinc because that actually is</p>
<p>that supports the detoxification in the</p>
<p>body and not to mention that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>exposed to a thousand new chemicals</p>
<p>every year we don&rsquo;t have these trace</p>
<p>minerals it&rsquo;s hard for our body to</p>
<p>eliminate that so trace mineral would be</p>
<p>a good thing but also the sea kelp which</p>
<p>has a lot of the trace minerals in it so</p>
<p>hey thanks for your question hey Lisa</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the line you had questions</p>
<p>about getting dizzy and I think dark</p>
<p>circles go ahead oh my goodness first of</p>
<p>all I wanted to compliment you hello if</p>
<p>the question is about my husband however</p>
<p>I want to say thank you thank you thank</p>
<p>you so much for caring because I&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>devout religious person in my faith and</p>
<p>I always said to myself why can&rsquo;t I</p>
<p>master this gluttony problem I have and</p>
<p>I thought that I that there was</p>
<p>something wrong with me and then when I</p>
<p>listened to you I found out that I was</p>
<p>addicted mmm sugar because and then when</p>
<p>I dumped everything out and they looked</p>
<p>at every ingredient everything when I</p>
<p>went shopping it was in the meets it was</p>
<p>in everything practically so I just want</p>
<p>to say God bless you and you set me free</p>
<p>I am no longer a slave to food</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so excited to watch you guys I</p>
<p>really know that you are my hero and I</p>
<p>know that sounds really corny but it is</p>
<p>so true I am free I am free I&rsquo;m not a</p>
<p>slave anymore you&rsquo;re going to make me</p>
<p>cry</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m shaking it this is just amazing I</p>
<p>watch you all the time every night until</p>
<p>like 3:00 in the morning I&rsquo;m trying to</p>
<p>get so educated because I mentioned you</p>
<p>on my channel as well and I&rsquo;m gonna send</p>
<p>you a plaque to call you my hero and yes</p>
<p>you should get that fireman outfit</p>
<p>uniform ia&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because you are saving lives okay you</p>
<p>have to where I work Oh</p>
<p>everywhere you go I am gonna see it from</p>
<p>now on all right but I know you have</p>
<p>other Carles but my husband he is doing</p>
<p>this too and he has I guess dizziness a</p>
<p>little bit of a headache he&rsquo;s looking at</p>
<p>my saying why do you have all those</p>
<p>black circles under your eyes and and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s kind of low on energy so I oh I</p>
<p>love you guys</p>
<p>so I need help he&rsquo;s listening to you</p>
<p>right now in the living room and he</p>
<p>wants to feel strong again okay all</p>
<p>right good good question thanks Lisa it</p>
<p>sounds to me that your husband&rsquo;s</p>
<p>symptoms are classic</p>
<p>hypoglycemia which is insulin resistance</p>
<p>now check this out here the person</p>
<p>consumes all these carbs right and the</p>
<p>sugar over a period of time then your</p>
<p>body starts forming a resistance to that</p>
<p>and says oh it&rsquo;s poison it&rsquo;s toxic get</p>
<p>it out there so the cells start to close</p>
<p>down so they don&rsquo;t absorb this stuff any</p>
<p>more right now what happens after that</p>
<p>you have instant resistance is</p>
<p>devices hey we need to feed the cells so</p>
<p>it starts increasing insulin so you have</p>
<p>high insulin right it&rsquo;s gonna push the</p>
<p>blood sugars down hypoglycemia low blood</p>
<p>sugars at first that&rsquo;s like a precursor</p>
<p>to eventually and then it can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>compensate now we get high sugar we get</p>
<p>become a diabetic so it sounds like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that more of a hypoglycemic and the</p>
<p>symptoms for that I think are you know</p>
<p>heart palpitations dizziness</p>
<p>irritability</p>
<p>dark circles all these all these</p>
<p>symptoms that so many people have</p>
<p>so that goes on and on and on so the</p>
<p>symptoms for insulin resistance could be</p>
<p>identical to hypoglycemia or</p>
<p>hyperglycemia</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a little confusing I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>have to create a video on that so I</p>
<p>would get him on the same program you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing and that should handle it but</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s interesting is when you consume</p>
<p>sugar your receptors for sugar shut down</p>
<p>and you need more and more so become</p>
<p>addicting so you need more sugar to</p>
<p>create the same pleasure and that throws</p>
<p>off your whole chemistry and then you</p>
<p>can insert a resistance now you&rsquo;ve got a</p>
<p>serious problem you know pulling and all</p>
<p>these things like serotonin and dopamine</p>
<p>and now you really want sugar to get</p>
<p>that pleasure so now you&rsquo;re addicted</p>
<p>so really addictions are a side effect</p>
<p>unfortunately in medicine right now</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to make addictions of</p>
<p>everything a disease that must be</p>
<p>treated with medication it&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to see more and more of</p>
<p>that but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not the truth the</p>
<p>truth is that addictions are a symptom</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>something else and that&rsquo;s what you need</p>
<p>to fix not this thing over here thanks</p>
<p>Lisa all right Karen okay so I just I</p>
<p>just got word that for the YouTube users</p>
<p>it is true the the cheat sheet link is</p>
<p>blocked by some third party blah blah</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t get the whole thing but you will</p>
<p>receive it later in the day so okay cool</p>
<p>stay tuned okay and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I was working on while you</p>
<p>were doing something else like a call</p>
<p>from Cynthia&rsquo;s she&rsquo;s from Los Angeles</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s been waiting 23 minutes and 49</p>
<p>seconds go ahead Cynthia</p>
<p>hi guys</p>
<p>yeah I love you both and I&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>excited about your success and what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing for people all over the</p>
<p>world I&rsquo;m so excited about that and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>in tears to talking to you because I</p>
<p>just love you guys to death anyway</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m calling because dr. Berg I have been</p>
<p>in doing intermittent fasting for</p>
<p>probably four or five months and I</p>
<p>started losing weight and then I could</p>
<p>not like each eye I was I was not being</p>
<p>a good girl and I would like drink some</p>
<p>a little bit of alcohol and have some</p>
<p>wine and you know and then I would have</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t really cheating a lot but it</p>
<p>was enough to throw me off but I decided</p>
<p>to really be ethical about it and start</p>
<p>doing this full-time you know a hundred</p>
<p>percent what what happened is I started</p>
<p>breaking out in my face now I have</p>
<p>psoriasis which I talked to you about</p>
<p>before but this is different this</p>
<p>breakout on my face is it&rsquo;s red and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>under my eye and it&rsquo;s on my cheek and</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;m a little vain so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>freaking me out and I don&rsquo;t know what to</p>
<p>do look so Cynthia I have you really</p>
<p>cleaned up the diet and gone back or are</p>
<p>you still a little bit off the</p>
<p>only thing I&rsquo;m doing because I am doing</p>
<p>intermittent fasting I&rsquo;m only eating</p>
<p>twice a day if anything the only thing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m eating is this because I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>been able to get your ice cream yet is</p>
<p>this certain ice cream in it the only</p>
<p>thing it has in it is agave but other</p>
<p>than that I&rsquo;m pretty a hundred percent</p>
<p>okay good so I think it&rsquo;s the agave</p>
<p>agave is very very interesting it has</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s considered a low glycemic but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just because 98% of its fructose</p>
<p>which means it infects the it goes after</p>
<p>the liver not the blood sugars right</p>
<p>away so it&rsquo;ll go right to the liver and</p>
<p>it creates insulin resistance and a</p>
<p>whole bunch of other problems try an</p>
<p>experiment and I I&rsquo;m almost 100%</p>
<p>positive this will work cut out that ice</p>
<p>cream okay don&rsquo;t eat any ice cream right</p>
<p>now and then within a week see if your</p>
<p>skin doesn&rsquo;t clear out I think it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>fructose there&rsquo;s always something in the</p>
<p>diet in the diet that&rsquo;s doing that the</p>
<p>other thing that&rsquo;s good for the skin is</p>
<p>that like trace mcplantz trace minerals</p>
<p>that also helps the skin iodine is good</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>or cyst</p>
<p>but the other thing that&rsquo;ll be good is</p>
<p>the B vitamins especially if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing keto and Aulus and you get like</p>
<p>rashes and stuff the B vitamins from</p>
<p>nutritional yeast help but I think I</p>
<p>would get off the agava nectar and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be totally fine your skin will</p>
<p>come back really nicely alright Cynthia</p>
<p>thanks for calling okay Karen okay so I</p>
<p>have Eunice here from Facebook and she</p>
<p>wants to know how long can you do one</p>
<p>meal a day</p>
<p>you can do it for 23 hours and then go</p>
<p>right back for the next meal yeah no you</p>
<p>could do one meal a day believe it or</p>
<p>not if you want to check and you</p>
<p>probably won&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>this happen but when you go into one</p>
<p>meal a day you got a serious amount of</p>
<p>called etapa G which is the body</p>
<p>recycling itself cleaning itself out</p>
<p>anti-aging and it&rsquo;s really awesome I</p>
<p>have this book that I just got I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>into it hardcore I have to use the</p>
<p>dictionary because there&rsquo;s a lot of big</p>
<p>words but what happens is you start</p>
<p>doing that the need for the absolute</p>
<p>high end of like your RDAs go down</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re conserving and recycling</p>
<p>your nutrients your protein your fatty</p>
<p>acids so in other words you can do it</p>
<p>for a long term now if you start finding</p>
<p>that your hair is falling out you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting tired and you don&rsquo;t feel very</p>
<p>good which by the way is really really</p>
<p>rare then you might need to add enhance</p>
<p>that with more nutrients externally but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m finding that people are doing it</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re loving it they&rsquo;re not hungry and</p>
<p>it kind of throws off this whole myth</p>
<p>that you know if you don&rsquo;t eat you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna starve yourself you like people</p>
<p>freaked out that&rsquo;s not really what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening you&rsquo;re not starving what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating is your own fat the meal</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re eating is your fat and that</p>
<p>has a lot of energy and so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not starving when you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>eating the meal is your own body just</p>
<p>happens to be on your midsection green</p>
<p>lips or your hips yeah so yeah was that</p>
<p>a long answer to a short question yeah</p>
<p>but I have another question okay okay so</p>
<p>Adrian on YouTube is is asking so</p>
<p>adrenal body types should not fast or</p>
<p>can fast no they need to fast okay the</p>
<p>only thing is they a lot of adrenal</p>
<p>cases have hypoglycemia and if you fast</p>
<p>too quickly you&rsquo;re gonna crash and burn</p>
<p>because what happens the blood sugars go</p>
<p>down and then what kicks in there is the</p>
<p>adrenal the adrenal has a natural</p>
<p>counter thing where raised the sugar and</p>
<p>especially adrenaline and then there</p>
<p>goes the cortisol so that&rsquo;s really what</p>
<p>happens so as long as you do it</p>
<p>gradually with may be supporting be</p>
<p>vitamins and minerals you&rsquo;re gonna be</p>
<p>totally fine it&rsquo;ll take the stress off</p>
<p>the Drina &rsquo;ls and you actually help heal</p>
<p>of the adrenals but I did want to</p>
<p>mention Karen we have a little</p>
<p>Facebook group that we just started yes</p>
<p>and this is called the doctor burst Kido</p>
<p>an eminent lab so we&rsquo;re doing all sorts</p>
<p>of experiments and it&rsquo;s people like what</p>
<p>what are you gonna do on me well we</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t really do anything to you because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all online so it&rsquo;s just basically a</p>
<p>community that we can share successful</p>
<p>actions it&rsquo;s pure so don&rsquo;t bring</p>
<p>your affiliate Lakes don&rsquo;t try to</p>
<p>promote stuff it&rsquo;s not meant to hey try</p>
<p>this other diet the - diet no no we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not going to talk about these things</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t work we&rsquo;re gonna talk about</p>
<p>what we found that seems to be</p>
<p>successful so you can actually go to</p>
<p>Facebook and sign up for that and we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>let you in and just don&rsquo;t use any swear</p>
<p>words be nice yeah be friendly that</p>
<p>99.99% are super super nice yeah you do</p>
<p>have occasional troll but we can do it</p>
<p>oh yeah and if you actually if you see a</p>
<p>troll saying something like that just</p>
<p>let us know anything Sasa well nixon</p>
<p>okay we&rsquo;ll take them in the back and</p>
<p>okay now I want to go to a question</p>
<p>magic from Sedona Arizona wow that must</p>
<p>be a nice place to live go ahead oh</p>
<p>hey thanks dr. Byrd for all you&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>in Terran - you&rsquo;ve made a great</p>
<p>difference in my life and my stepdads</p>
<p>got pancreatic</p>
<p>cancer and he&rsquo;s having trouble keeping</p>
<p>anything down I was wondering if there</p>
<p>was any diet or supplements or anything</p>
<p>you would recommend for that yeah good</p>
<p>question sorry to hear that magic but</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s some here&rsquo;s some things that you</p>
<p>can do</p>
<p>one of the one of the probably right off</p>
<p>the bat the thing that I would do with</p>
<p>him and he&rsquo;s probably already doing this</p>
<p>is in a minute fasting because he can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>keep anything down I would do a</p>
<p>combination of in a minute fasting with</p>
<p>that something that&rsquo;s easy to digest</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really really really high in</p>
<p>nutrients probably like a bone broth</p>
<p>type thing like a soup with garlic and</p>
<p>onions in there that would be great</p>
<p>this is the case where I&rsquo;d probably do</p>
<p>pure vegetable juices you can juice it</p>
<p>and get it down but not with an apple in</p>
<p>there and not with any fruit at all just</p>
<p>pure vegetable juice okay that you juice</p>
<p>you by hand all organic and and start</p>
<p>doing that a few times a day the protein</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to need is going to be</p>
<p>important because</p>
<p>maybe you might have to do just maybe a</p>
<p>little bit of high-quality egg or</p>
<p>something like that to get his amino</p>
<p>acids broccoli sprouts are really hot in</p>
<p>fact all the sprouts I would be</p>
<p>sprouting and trying to do as much</p>
<p>sprout as I can and just really avoid</p>
<p>anything GMO soy things like that any</p>
<p>sugar and let him heal but Dean Amanda</p>
<p>fasting is gonna be very very beneficial</p>
<p>though that&rsquo;s what I would recommend</p>
<p>okay magic thanks for calling all right</p>
<p>Karen we&rsquo;re going to you okay me a</p>
<p>really good question this time</p>
<p>[Laughter]</p>
<p>I was I was still working a little bit</p>
<p>on the cheat form here I know you guys</p>
<p>are trying to get it and anybody that</p>
<p>types it in to Facebook you will</p>
<p>eventually get it and we&rsquo;re gonna figure</p>
<p>out a link the link on YouTube don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worry we&rsquo;ll be promoting it all over the</p>
<p>place the other thing I wanted to ask</p>
<p>about dr. Berg is</p>
<p>this</p>
<p>audio</p>
<p>book thing you have going the cool USB</p>
<p>did you want to mention that this is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a new thing I just put and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna create a video in this I just put</p>
<p>this entire book in 7:19 seminars okay</p>
<p>that was some serious work to actually</p>
<p>have to read my book again which I</p>
<p>actually I found it&rsquo;s pretty cool it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a lot of great information</p>
<p>in that book so I did a video in every</p>
<p>single chapter and it just I&rsquo;ll be able</p>
<p>to put it on a link that you can go and</p>
<p>watch the videos but we also put the</p>
<p>audio version on a USB and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little adapter you can download it to</p>
<p>your cell phone so that&rsquo;s on the site</p>
<p>right now that&rsquo;s available you can check</p>
<p>that out it&rsquo;s just going to really help</p>
<p>you get the full breadth of all the data</p>
<p>in here and you know driving your car or</p>
<p>basically when you&rsquo;re jogging or walking</p>
<p>you could listen to this data dr. Burke</p>
<p>I hear music</p>
<p>could it could it really be 12 o&rsquo;clock</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 12 o&rsquo;clock and hey guys I really</p>
<p>appreciate your questions your wonderful</p>
<p>comments I&rsquo;m glad that it&rsquo;s helping you</p>
<p>stay tuned next week will be the same</p>
