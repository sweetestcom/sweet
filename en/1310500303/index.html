    <p>The following is a conversation with Demis Hassabis,</p>
<p>CEO and co founder of DeepMind,</p>
<p>a company that has published and built</p>
<p>some of the most incredible artificial intelligence systems</p>
<p>in the history of computing,</p>
<p>including AlphaZero that learned all by itself</p>
<p>to play the game of go better than any human in the world</p>
<p>and AlphaFold2 that solved protein folding.</p>
<p>Both tasks considered nearly impossible</p>
<p>for a very long time.</p>
<p>Demis is widely considered to be</p>
<p>one of the most brilliant and impactful humans</p>
<p>in the history of artificial intelligence</p>
<p>and science and engineering in general.</p>
<p>This was truly an honor and a pleasure for me</p>
<p>to finally sit down with him for this conversation.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure we will talk many times again in the future.</p>
<p>This is the Lux Readman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Demis Hassabis.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a bit of a personal question.</p>
<p>Am I an AI program you wrote to interview people</p>
<p>until I get good enough to interview you?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;d be impressed if you were.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be impressed by myself if you were.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re quite up to that yet,</p>
<p>but maybe you&rsquo;re from the future, Lex.</p>
<p>If you did, would you tell me?</p>
<p>Is that a good thing to tell a language model</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s tasked with interviewing</p>
<p>that it is, in fact, AI?</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;re in a kind of meta Turing test.</p>
<p>Probably it would be a good idea not to tell you,</p>
<p>so it doesn&rsquo;t change your behavior, right?</p>
<p>This is a kind of link.</p>
<p>Heisenberg uncertainty principle situation.</p>
<p>If I told you, you&rsquo;d behave differently.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening with us, of course.</p>
<p>This is a benchmark from the future</p>
<p>where they replay 2022 as a year</p>
<p>before AIs were good enough yet,</p>
<p>and now we want to see, is it gonna pass?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>If I was such a program,</p>
<p>would you be able to tell, do you think?</p>
<p>So to the Turing test question,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve talked about the benchmark for solving intelligence.</p>
<p>What would be the impressive thing?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked about winning a Nobel Prize</p>
<p>and AIS system winning a Nobel Prize,</p>
<p>but I still return to the Turing test as a compelling test,</p>
<p>the spirit of the Turing test as a compelling test.</p>
<p>Yeah, the Turing test, of course,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been unbelievably influential,</p>
<p>and Turing&rsquo;s one of my all time heroes,</p>
<p>but I think if you look back at the 1950 paper,</p>
<p>his original paper and read the original,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see, I don&rsquo;t think he meant it</p>
<p>to be a rigorous formal test.</p>
<p>I think it was more like a thought experiment,</p>
<p>almost a bit of philosophy he was writing</p>
<p>if you look at the style of the paper,</p>
<p>and you can see he didn&rsquo;t specify it very rigorously.</p>
<p>So for example, he didn&rsquo;t specify the knowledge</p>
<p>that the expert or judge would have.</p>
<p>How much time would they have to investigate this?</p>
<p>So these are important parameters</p>
<p>if you were gonna make it a true sort of formal test.</p>
<p>And by some measures, people claim the Turing test passed</p>
<p>several, a decade ago, I remember someone claiming that</p>
<p>with a kind of very bog standard, normal logic model,</p>
<p>because they pretended it was a kid.</p>
<p>So the judges thought that the machine was a child.</p>
<p>So that would be very different</p>
<p>from an expert AI person interrogating a machine</p>
<p>and knowing how it was built and so on.</p>
<p>So I think we should probably move away from that</p>
<p>as a formal test and move more towards a general test</p>
<p>where we test the AI capabilities on a range of tasks</p>
<p>and see if it reaches human level or above performance</p>
<p>on maybe thousands, perhaps even millions of tasks</p>
<p>eventually and cover the entire sort of cognitive space.</p>
<p>So I think for its time,</p>
<p>it was an amazing thought experiment.</p>
<p>And also 1950s, obviously there&rsquo;s barely the dawn</p>
<p>of the computer age.</p>
<p>So of course he only thought about text</p>
<p>and now we have a lot more different inputs.</p>
<p>So yeah, maybe the better thing to test</p>
<p>is the generalizability, so across multiple tasks.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s also possible as systems like Gato show</p>
<p>that eventually that might map right back to language.</p>
<p>So you might be able to demonstrate your ability</p>
<p>to generalize across tasks by then communicating</p>
<p>your ability to generalize across tasks,</p>
<p>which is kind of what we do through conversation anyway</p>
<p>when we jump around.</p>
<p>Ultimately what&rsquo;s in there in that conversation</p>
<p>is not just you moving around knowledge,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you moving around like these entirely different</p>
<p>modalities of understanding that ultimately map</p>
<p>to your ability to operate successfully</p>
<p>in all of these domains, which you can think of as tasks.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think certainly we as humans use language</p>
<p>as our main generalization communication tool.</p>
<p>So I think we end up thinking in language</p>
<p>and expressing our solutions in language.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going to be a very powerful mode in which</p>
<p>to explain the system, to explain what it&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the only modality that matters.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s going to be a lot of different ways</p>
<p>to express capabilities other than just language.</p>
<p>Yeah, visual, robotics, body language,</p>
<p>yeah, actions, the interactive aspect of all that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all part of it.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s interesting with Gato is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of pushing prediction to the maximum</p>
<p>in terms of like mapping arbitrary sequences</p>
<p>to other sequences and sort of just predicting</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to happen next.</p>
<p>So prediction seems to be fundamental to intelligence.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;re predicting doesn&rsquo;t so much matter.</p>
<p>Yeah, it seems like you can generalize that quite well.</p>
<p>So obviously language models predict the next word,</p>
<p>Gato predicts potentially any action or any token.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just the beginning really.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s our most general agent one could call it so far,</p>
<p>but that itself can be scaled up massively more</p>
<p>than we&rsquo;ve done so far.</p>
<p>And obviously we&rsquo;re in the middle of doing that.</p>
<p>But the big part of solving AGI is creating benchmarks</p>
<p>that help us get closer and closer,</p>
<p>sort of creating benchmarks that test the generalizability.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just still interesting that this fella,</p>
<p>Alan Turing, was one of the first</p>
<p>and probably still one of the only people</p>
<p>that was trying, maybe philosophically,</p>
<p>but was trying to formulate a benchmark</p>
<p>that could be followed.</p>
<p>It is, even though it&rsquo;s fuzzy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still sufficiently rigorous</p>
<p>to where you can run that test.</p>
<p>And I still think something like the Turing test</p>
<p>will, at the end of the day,</p>
<p>be the thing that truly impresses other humans</p>
<p>so that you can have a close friend who&rsquo;s an AI system.</p>
<p>And for that friend to be a good friend,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to have to be able to play StarCraft</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna have to do all of these tasks,</p>
<p>get you a beer, so the robotics tasks,</p>
<p>play games with you, use language,</p>
<p>humor, all of those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But that ultimately can boil down to language.</p>
<p>It feels like, not in terms of the AI community,</p>
<p>but in terms of the actual impact</p>
<p>of general intelligence on the world,</p>
<p>it feels like language will be the place</p>
<p>where it truly shines.</p>
<p>I think so, because it&rsquo;s such an important</p>
<p>kind of input output for us.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I think the Turing test,</p>
<p>the kind of the philosophy behind it,</p>
<p>which is the idea of can a machine mimic</p>
<p>the behaviors of a human?</p>
<p>And I would say wider than just language and text,</p>
<p>then in terms of actions and everything else,</p>
<p>creativity, all these things,</p>
<p>then if it can sort of match or exceed</p>
<p>human cognitive capabilities,</p>
<p>then I think we have a true intelligence.</p>
<p>So from that perspective, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I think he did formulate the right kind of setup.</p>
<p>I just, I think there&rsquo;ll be a kind of humor</p>
<p>in the AI systems of the future looking back</p>
<p>to this conversation and thinking about the Turing test</p>
<p>and also thinking about by that time,</p>
<p>they would know which year they were finally able</p>
<p>to sort of cross the threshold of human level intelligence</p>
<p>and think how funny it is that we humans</p>
<p>were still confused about this whole problem</p>
<p>that has been long ago been solved.</p>
<p>Well, hello to the AI agents of the future.</p>
<p>Anyway, so going back to your journey,</p>
<p>when did you fall in love with programming first?</p>
<p>Well, I was pretty young age actually.</p>
<p>So, I started off, actually games was my first love.</p>
<p>So starting to play chess when I was around four years old</p>
<p>and then it was actually with winnings</p>
<p>from a chess competition that I managed</p>
<p>to buy my first chess computer</p>
<p>when I was about eight years old.</p>
<p>It was a ZX Spectrum, which was hugely popular</p>
<p>in the UK at the time.</p>
<p>And it was amazing machine because I think it trained</p>
<p>a whole generation of programmers in the UK</p>
<p>because it was so accessible.</p>
<p>You know, you literally switched it on</p>
<p>and there was the basic prompt</p>
<p>and you could just get going.</p>
<p>And my parents didn&rsquo;t really know anything about computers.</p>
<p>So, but because it was my money from a chess competition,</p>
<p>I could say I wanted to buy it.</p>
<p>And then, you know, I just went to bookstores,</p>
<p>got books on programming and started typing in,</p>
<p>you know, the programming code.</p>
<p>And then of course, once you start doing that,</p>
<p>you start adjusting it and then making your own games.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when I fell in love with computers</p>
<p>and realized that they were a very magical device.</p>
<p>In a way, I kind of, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able</p>
<p>to explain this at the time,</p>
<p>but I felt that they were sort of almost</p>
<p>a magical extension of your mind.</p>
<p>I always had this feeling and I&rsquo;ve always loved this</p>
<p>about computers that you can set them off doing something,</p>
<p>some task for you, you can go to sleep,</p>
<p>come back the next day and it&rsquo;s solved.</p>
<p>You know, that feels magical to me.</p>
<p>So, I mean, all machines do that to some extent.</p>
<p>They all enhance our natural capabilities.</p>
<p>Obviously cars make us, allow us to move faster</p>
<p>than we can run, but this was a machine to extend the mind.</p>
<p>And then of course, AI is the ultimate expression</p>
<p>of what a machine may be able to do or learn.</p>
<p>So very naturally for me, that thought extended</p>
<p>into AI quite quickly.</p>
<p>Do you remember the programming language</p>
<p>that was first started and was it special to the machine?</p>
<p>No, I think it was just basic on the ZX Spectrum.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what specific form it was.</p>
<p>And then later on I got a Commodore Amiga,</p>
<p>which was a fantastic machine.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re just showing off.</p>
<p>So yeah, well, lots of my friends had Atari STs</p>
<p>and I managed to get Amigas, it was a bit more powerful</p>
<p>and that was incredible and used to do programming</p>
<p>in assembler and also Amos basic,</p>
<p>this specific form of basic, it was incredible actually.</p>
<p>So I learned all my coding skills.</p>
<p>And when did you fall in love with AI?</p>
<p>So when did you first start to gain an understanding</p>
<p>that you can not just write programs</p>
<p>that do some mathematical operations for you</p>
<p>while you sleep, but something that&rsquo;s akin</p>
<p>to bringing an entity to life,</p>
<p>sort of a thing that can figure out something</p>
<p>more complicated than a simple mathematical operation.</p>
<p>Yeah, so there was a few stages for me</p>
<p>all while I was very young.</p>
<p>So first of all, as I was trying to improve</p>
<p>at playing chess, I was captaining</p>
<p>various England junior chess teams.</p>
<p>And at the time when I was about maybe 10, 11 years old,</p>
<p>I was gonna become a professional chess player.</p>
<p>That was my first thought.</p>
<p>So that dream was there to try to get</p>
<p>to the highest levels of chess.</p>
<p>Yeah, so when I was about 12 years old,</p>
<p>I got to master standard and I was second highest rated</p>
<p>player in the world to Judith Polgar,</p>
<p>who obviously ended up being an amazing chess player</p>
<p>and a world women&rsquo;s champion.</p>
<p>And when I was trying to improve at chess,</p>
<p>where what you do is you obviously, first of all,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to improve your own thinking processes.</p>
<p>So that leads you to thinking about thinking,</p>
<p>how is your brain coming up with these ideas?</p>
<p>Why is it making mistakes?</p>
<p>How can you improve that thought process?</p>
<p>But the second thing is that you,</p>
<p>it was just the beginning, this was like in the early 80s,</p>
<p>mid 80s of chess computers.</p>
<p>If you remember, they were physical balls</p>
<p>like the one we have in front of us.</p>
<p>And you press down the squares.</p>
<p>And I think Kasparov had a branded version of it</p>
<p>that I got.</p>
<p>And you used to, they&rsquo;re not as strong as they are today,</p>
<p>but they were pretty strong and you used to practice</p>
<p>against them to try and improve your openings</p>
<p>and other things.</p>
<p>And so I remember, I think I probably got my first one,</p>
<p>I was around 11 or 12.</p>
<p>And I remember thinking, this is amazing,</p>
<p>how has someone programmed this chess board to play chess?</p>
<p>And it was very formative book I bought,</p>
<p>which was called The Chess Computer Handbook</p>
<p>by David Levy.</p>
<p>This thing came out in 1984 or something.</p>
<p>So I must&rsquo;ve got it when I was about 11, 12.</p>
<p>And it explained fully how these chess programs were made.</p>
<p>And I remember my first AI program</p>
<p>being programming my Amiga.</p>
<p>It couldn&rsquo;t, it wasn&rsquo;t powerful enough to play chess.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t write a whole chess program,</p>
<p>but I wrote a program for it to play Othello or reverse it,</p>
<p>sometimes called I think in the US.</p>
<p>And so a slightly simpler game than chess,</p>
<p>but I used all of the principles that chess programs had,</p>
<p>alpha, beta, search, all of that.</p>
<p>And that was my first AI program.</p>
<p>I remember that very well, I was around 12 years old.</p>
<p>So that brought me into AI.</p>
<p>And then the second part was later on,</p>
<p>when I was around 16, 17,</p>
<p>and I was writing games professionally, designing games,</p>
<p>writing a game called Theme Park,</p>
<p>which had AI as a core gameplay component</p>
<p>as part of the simulation.</p>
<p>And it sold millions of copies around the world.</p>
<p>And people loved the way that the AI,</p>
<p>even though it was relatively simple</p>
<p>by today&rsquo;s AI standards,</p>
<p>was reacting to the way you as the player played it.</p>
<p>So it was called a sandbox game.</p>
<p>So it was one of the first types of games like that,</p>
<p>along with SimCity.</p>
<p>And it meant that every game you played was unique.</p>
<p>Is there something you could say just on a small tangent</p>
<p>about really impressive AI</p>
<p>from a game design, human enjoyment perspective,</p>
<p>really impressive AI that you&rsquo;ve seen in games</p>
<p>and maybe what does it take to create an AI system?</p>
<p>And how hard of a problem is that?</p>
<p>So a million questions just as a brief tangent.</p>
<p>Well, look, I think games have been significant in my life</p>
<p>for three reasons.</p>
<p>So first of all, I was playing them</p>
<p>and training myself on games when I was a kid.</p>
<p>Then I went through a phase of designing games</p>
<p>and writing AI for games.</p>
<p>So all the games I professionally wrote</p>
<p>had AI as a core component.</p>
<p>And that was mostly in the 90s.</p>
<p>And the reason I was doing that in games industry</p>
<p>was at the time the games industry,</p>
<p>I think was the cutting edge of technology.</p>
<p>So whether it was graphics with people like John Carmack</p>
<p>and Quake and those kinds of things or AI,</p>
<p>I think actually all the action was going on in games.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re still reaping the benefits of that</p>
<p>even with things like GPUs, which I find ironic</p>
<p>was obviously invented for graphics, computer graphics,</p>
<p>but then turns out to be amazingly useful for AI.</p>
<p>It just turns out everything&rsquo;s a matrix multiplication</p>
<p>it appears in the whole world.</p>
<p>So I think games at the time had the most cutting edge AI.</p>
<p>And a lot of the games, I was involved in writing.</p>
<p>So there was a game called Black and White,</p>
<p>which was one game I was involved with</p>
<p>in the early stages of,</p>
<p>which I still think is the most impressive example</p>
<p>of reinforcement learning in a computer game.</p>
<p>So in that game, you trained a little pet animal and&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a brilliant game.</p>
<p>And it sort of learned from how you were treating it.</p>
<p>So if you treated it badly, then it became mean.</p>
<p>And then it would be mean to your villagers</p>
<p>and your population, the sort of the little tribe</p>
<p>that you were running.</p>
<p>But if you were kind to it, then it would be kind.</p>
<p>And people were fascinated by how that works.</p>
<p>And so was I to be honest with the way it kind of developed.</p>
<p>And&hellip;</p>
<p>Especially the mapping to good and evil.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Made you realize, made me realize that you can sort of</p>
<p>in the choices you make can define where you end up.</p>
<p>And that means all of us are capable of the good, evil.</p>
<p>It all matters in the different choices</p>
<p>along the trajectory to those places that you make.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>I mean, games can do that philosophically to you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s rare.</p>
<p>It seems rare.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, games are, I think, a unique medium</p>
<p>because you as the player,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not just passively consuming the entertainment,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re actually actively involved as an agent.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s what makes it in some ways</p>
<p>can be more visceral than other mediums</p>
<p>like films and books.</p>
<p>So the second, so that was designing AI in games.</p>
<p>And then the third use we&rsquo;ve used of AI</p>
<p>is in DeepMind from the beginning,</p>
<p>which is using games as a testing ground</p>
<p>for proving out AI algorithms and developing AI algorithms.</p>
<p>And that was a sort of a core component</p>
<p>of our vision at the start of DeepMind</p>
<p>was that we would use games very heavily</p>
<p>as our main testing ground, certainly to begin with,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s super efficient to use games.</p>
<p>And also, it&rsquo;s very easy to have metrics</p>
<p>to see how well your systems are improving</p>
<p>and what direction your ideas are going in</p>
<p>and whether you&rsquo;re making incremental improvements.</p>
<p>And because those games are often rooted</p>
<p>in something that humans did for a long time beforehand,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s already a strong set of rules.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s already a damn good benchmark.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s really good for so many reasons</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve got clear measures</p>
<p>of how good humans can be at these things.</p>
<p>And in some cases like Go,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been playing it for thousands of years</p>
<p>and often they have scores or at least win conditions.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very easy for reward learning systems</p>
<p>to get a reward.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to specify what that reward is.</p>
<p>And also at the end, it&rsquo;s easy to test externally</p>
<p>at how strong is your system by of course,</p>
<p>playing against the world&rsquo;s strongest players at those games.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s so good for so many reasons</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s also very efficient to run potentially millions</p>
<p>of simulations in parallel on the cloud.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a huge reason why we were so successful</p>
<p>back in starting out 2010,</p>
<p>how come we were able to progress so quickly</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve utilized games.</p>
<p>And at the beginning of DeepMind,</p>
<p>we also hired some amazing game engineers</p>
<p>who I knew from my previous lives in the games industry.</p>
<p>And that helped to bootstrap us very quickly.</p>
<p>And plus it&rsquo;s somehow super compelling</p>
<p>almost at a philosophical level of man versus machine</p>
<p>over a chess board or a Go board.</p>
<p>And especially given that the entire history of AI</p>
<p>is defined by people saying it&rsquo;s gonna be impossible</p>
<p>to make a machine that beats a human being in chess.</p>
<p>And then once that happened,</p>
<p>people were certain when I was coming up in AI</p>
<p>that Go is not a game that can be solved</p>
<p>because of the combinatorial complexity is just too,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s no matter how much Moore&rsquo;s law you have,</p>
<p>compute is just never going to be able</p>
<p>to crack the game of Go.</p>
<p>And so then there&rsquo;s something compelling about facing,</p>
<p>sort of taking on the impossibility of that task</p>
<p>from the AI researcher perspective,</p>
<p>engineer perspective, and then as a human being,</p>
<p>just observing this whole thing.</p>
<p>Your beliefs about what you thought was impossible</p>
<p>being broken apart,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s humbling to realize we&rsquo;re not as smart as we thought.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s humbling to realize that the things we think</p>
<p>are impossible now perhaps will be done in the future.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something really powerful about a game,</p>
<p>AI system beating human being in a game</p>
<p>that drives that message home</p>
<p>for like millions, billions of people,</p>
<p>especially in the case of Go.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Well, look, I think it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I mean, it has been a fascinating journey</p>
<p>and especially as I think about it from,</p>
<p>I can understand it from both sides,</p>
<p>both as the AI, creators of the AI,</p>
<p>but also as a games player originally.</p>
<p>So, it was a really interesting,</p>
<p>I mean, it was a fantastic, but also somewhat</p>
<p>bittersweet moment, the AlphaGo match for me,</p>
<p>seeing that and being obviously heavily involved in that.</p>
<p>But as you say, chess has been the,</p>
<p>I mean, Kasparov, I think rightly called it</p>
<p>the Drosophila of intelligence, right?</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s sort of, I love that phrase</p>
<p>and I think he&rsquo;s right because chess has been</p>
<p>hand in hand with AI from the beginning</p>
<p>of the whole field, right?</p>
<p>So, I think every AI practitioner,</p>
<p>starting with Turing and Claude Shannon and all those,</p>
<p>the sort of forefathers of the field,</p>
<p>tried their hand at writing a chess program.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got original edition of Claude Shannon&rsquo;s</p>
<p>first chess program, I think it was 1949,</p>
<p>the original sort of paper.</p>
<p>And they all did that and Turing famously wrote</p>
<p>a chess program, but all the computers around them</p>
<p>were obviously too slow to run it.</p>
<p>So, he had to run, he had to be the computer, right?</p>
<p>So, he literally, I think spent two or three days</p>
<p>running his own program by hand with pencil and paper</p>
<p>and playing a friend of his with his chess program.</p>
<p>So, of course, Deep Blue was a huge moment,</p>
<p>beating Kasparov, but actually when that happened,</p>
<p>I remember that very vividly, of course,</p>
<p>because it was chess and computers and AI,</p>
<p>all the things I loved and I was at college at the time.</p>
<p>But I remember coming away from that,</p>
<p>being more impressed by Kasparov&rsquo;s mind</p>
<p>than I was by Deep Blue.</p>
<p>Because here was Kasparov with his human mind,</p>
<p>not only could he play chess more or less</p>
<p>to the same level as this brute of a calculation machine,</p>
<p>but of course, Kasparov can do everything else</p>
<p>humans can do, ride a bike, talk many languages,</p>
<p>do politics, all the rest of the amazing things</p>
<p>that Kasparov does.</p>
<p>And so, with the same brain.</p>
<p>And yet Deep Blue, brilliant as it was at chess,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d been hand coded for chess and actually had distilled</p>
<p>the knowledge of chess grandmasters into a cool program,</p>
<p>but it couldn&rsquo;t do anything else.</p>
<p>It couldn&rsquo;t even play a strictly simpler game</p>
<p>like tic tac toe.</p>
<p>So, something to me was missing from intelligence</p>
<p>from that system that we would regard as intelligence.</p>
<p>And I think it was this idea of generality</p>
<p>and also learning.</p>
<p>So, and that&rsquo;s obviously what we tried to do with AlphaGo.</p>
<p>Yeah, with AlphaGo and AlphaZero, MuZero,</p>
<p>and then God and all the things that we&rsquo;ll get into</p>
<p>some parts of, there&rsquo;s just a fascinating trajectory here.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s just stick on chess briefly.</p>
<p>On the human side of chess, you&rsquo;ve proposed that</p>
<p>from a game design perspective,</p>
<p>the thing that makes chess compelling as a game</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a creative tension between a bishop</p>
<p>and the knight.</p>
<p>Can you explain this?</p>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s really interesting to think about</p>
<p>what makes a game compelling,</p>
<p>makes it stick across centuries.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was sort of thinking about this,</p>
<p>and actually a lot of even amazing chess players</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think about it necessarily</p>
<p>from a game&rsquo;s designer point of view.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s with my game design hat on</p>
<p>that I was thinking about this, why is chess so compelling?</p>
<p>And I think a critical reason is the dynamicness</p>
<p>of the different kind of chess positions you can have,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re closed or open and other things,</p>
<p>comes from the bishop and the knight.</p>
<p>So, if you think about how different</p>
<p>the capabilities of the bishop and knight are</p>
<p>in terms of the way they move,</p>
<p>and then somehow chess has evolved</p>
<p>to balance those two capabilities more or less equally.</p>
<p>So, they&rsquo;re both roughly worth three points each.</p>
<p>So, you think that dynamics is always there</p>
<p>and then the rest of the rules</p>
<p>are kind of trying to stabilize the game.</p>
<p>Well, maybe, I mean, it&rsquo;s sort of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s chicken and egg situation,</p>
<p>probably both came together.</p>
<p>But the fact that it&rsquo;s got to this beautiful equilibrium</p>
<p>where you can have the bishop and knight</p>
<p>that are so different in power,</p>
<p>but so equal in value across the set</p>
<p>of the universe of all positions, right?</p>
<p>Somehow they&rsquo;ve been balanced by humanity</p>
<p>over hundreds of years,</p>
<p>I think gives the game the creative tension</p>
<p>that you can swap the bishop and knights</p>
<p>for a bishop for a knight,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re more or less worth the same,</p>
<p>but now you aim for a different type of position.</p>
<p>If you have the knight, you want a closed position.</p>
<p>If you have the bishop, you want an open position.</p>
<p>So, I think that creates</p>
<p>a lot of the creative tension in chess.</p>
<p>So, some kind of controlled creative tension.</p>
<p>From an AI perspective,</p>
<p>do you think AI systems could eventually design games</p>
<p>that are optimally compelling to humans?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>Sometimes I get asked about AI and creativity,</p>
<p>and the way I answered that is relevant to that question,</p>
<p>which is that I think there are different levels</p>
<p>of creativity, one could say.</p>
<p>So, I think if we define creativity</p>
<p>as coming up with something original, right,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s useful for a purpose,</p>
<p>then I think the kind of lowest level of creativity</p>
<p>is like an interpolation.</p>
<p>So, an averaging of all the examples you see.</p>
<p>So, maybe a very basic AI system could say</p>
<p>you could have that.</p>
<p>So, you show it millions of pictures of cats,</p>
<p>and then you say, give me an average looking cat, right?</p>
<p>Generate me an average looking cat.</p>
<p>I would call that interpolation.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s extrapolation,</p>
<p>which something like AlphaGo showed.</p>
<p>So, AlphaGo played millions of games of Go against itself,</p>
<p>and then it came up with brilliant new ideas</p>
<p>like Move 37 in game two, brilliant motif strategies in Go</p>
<p>that no humans had ever thought of,</p>
<p>even though we&rsquo;ve played it for thousands of years</p>
<p>and professionally for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>So, that I call that extrapolation,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s still a level above that,</p>
<p>which is, you could call out of the box thinking</p>
<p>or true innovation, which is, could you invent Go, right?</p>
<p>Could you invent chess and not just come up</p>
<p>with a brilliant chess move or brilliant Go move,</p>
<p>but can you actually invent chess</p>
<p>or something as good as chess or Go?</p>
<p>And I think one day AI could, but then what&rsquo;s missing</p>
<p>is how would you even specify that task</p>
<p>to a program right now?</p>
<p>And the way I would do it if I was telling a human to do it</p>
<p>or a human games designer to do it is I would say,</p>
<p>something like Go, I would say, come up with a game</p>
<p>that only takes five minutes to learn,</p>
<p>which Go does because it&rsquo;s got simple rules,</p>
<p>but many lifetimes to master, right?</p>
<p>Or impossible to master in one lifetime</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so deep and so complex.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s aesthetically beautiful.</p>
<p>And also it can be completed in three or four hours</p>
<p>of gameplay time, which is useful for us in a human day.</p>
<p>And so you might specify these sort of high level concepts</p>
<p>like that, and then with that</p>
<p>and then maybe a few other things,</p>
<p>one could imagine that Go satisfies those constraints.</p>
<p>But the problem is that we&rsquo;re not able</p>
<p>to specify abstract notions like that,</p>
<p>high level abstract notions like that yet to our AI systems.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s still something missing there</p>
<p>in terms of high level concepts or abstractions</p>
<p>that they truly understand</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re combinable and compositional.</p>
<p>So for the moment, I think AI is capable</p>
<p>of doing interpolation and extrapolation,</p>
<p>but not true invention.</p>
<p>So coming up with rule sets and optimizing</p>
<p>with complicated objectives around those rule sets,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t currently do.</p>
<p>But you could take a specific rule set</p>
<p>and then run a kind of self play experiment</p>
<p>to see how long, just observe how an AI system</p>
<p>from scratch learns, how long is that journey of learning?</p>
<p>And maybe if it satisfies some of those other things</p>
<p>you mentioned in terms of quickness to learn and so on,</p>
<p>and you could see a long journey to master</p>
<p>for even an AI system, then you could say</p>
<p>that this is a promising game.</p>
<p>But it would be nice to do almost like AlphaCode</p>
<p>so programming rules.</p>
<p>So generating rules that automate even that part</p>
<p>of the generation of rules.</p>
<p>So I have thought about systems actually</p>
<p>that I think would be amazing for a games designer.</p>
<p>If you could have a system that takes your game,</p>
<p>plays it tens of millions of times, maybe overnight,</p>
<p>and then self balances the rules better.</p>
<p>So it tweaks the rules and maybe the equations</p>
<p>and the parameters so that the game is more balanced,</p>
<p>the units in the game or some of the rules could be tweaked.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a bit of like giving a base set</p>
<p>and then allowing Monte Carlo Tree Search</p>
<p>or something like that to sort of explore it.</p>
<p>And I think that would be super powerful tool actually</p>
<p>for balancing, auto balancing a game,</p>
<p>which usually takes thousands of hours</p>
<p>from hundreds of human games testers normally</p>
<p>to balance a game like StarCraft,</p>
<p>which is Blizzard are amazing at balancing their games,</p>
<p>but it takes them years and years and years.</p>
<p>So one could imagine at some point</p>
<p>when this stuff becomes efficient enough</p>
<p>to you might be able to do that like overnight.</p>
<p>Do you think a game that is optimal designed by an AI system</p>
<p>would look very much like a planet earth?</p>
<p>Maybe, maybe it&rsquo;s only the sort of game</p>
<p>I would love to make is, and I&rsquo;ve tried in my games career,</p>
<p>the games design career, my first big game</p>
<p>was designing a theme park, an amusement park.</p>
<p>Then with games like Republic, I tried to have games</p>
<p>where we designed whole cities and allowed you to play in.</p>
<p>So, and of course people like Will Wright</p>
<p>have written games like SimEarth,</p>
<p>trying to simulate the whole of earth, pretty tricky,</p>
<p>but I think.</p>
<p>SimEarth, I haven&rsquo;t actually played that one.</p>
<p>So what is it?</p>
<p>Does it incorporate of evolution or?</p>
<p>Yeah, it has evolution and it sort of tries to,</p>
<p>it sort of treats it as an entire biosphere,</p>
<p>but from quite high level.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be nice to be able to sort of zoom in,</p>
<p>zoom out and zoom in.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>So obviously it couldn&rsquo;t do, that was in the 90s.</p>
<p>I think he wrote that in the 90s.</p>
<p>So it couldn&rsquo;t, it wasn&rsquo;t able to do that,</p>
<p>but that would be obviously the ultimate sandbox game.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>On that topic, do you think we&rsquo;re living in a simulation?</p>
<p>Yes, well, so, okay.</p>
<p>So I.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna jump around from the absurdly philosophical</p>
<p>to the technical.</p>
<p>Sure, sure, very, very happy to.</p>
<p>So I think my answer to that question</p>
<p>is a little bit complex because there is simulation theory,</p>
<p>which obviously Nick Bostrom,</p>
<p>I think famously first proposed.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t quite believe it in that sense.</p>
<p>So in the sense that are we in some sort of computer game</p>
<p>or have our descendants somehow recreated earth</p>
<p>in the 21st century and some,</p>
<p>for some kind of experimental reason.</p>
<p>I think that, but I do think that we,</p>
<p>that we might be, that the best way to understand physics</p>
<p>and the universe is from a computational perspective.</p>
<p>So understanding it as an information universe</p>
<p>and actually information being the most fundamental unit</p>
<p>of reality rather than matter or energy.</p>
<p>So a physicist would say, you know, matter or energy,</p>
<p>you know, E equals MC squared.</p>
<p>These are the things that are the fundamentals</p>
<p>of the universe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d actually say information,</p>
<p>which of course itself can be,</p>
<p>can specify energy or matter, right?</p>
<p>Matter is actually just, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just out the way our bodies</p>
<p>and the molecules in our body are arranged as information.</p>
<p>So I think information may be the most fundamental way</p>
<p>to describe the universe.</p>
<p>And therefore you could say we&rsquo;re in some sort of simulation</p>
<p>because of that.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t, I do, I&rsquo;m not,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really a subscriber to the idea that, you know,</p>
<p>these are sort of throw away billions of simulations around.</p>
<p>I think this is actually very critical and possibly unique,</p>
<p>this simulation.</p>
<p>This particular one.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And you just mean treating the universe as a computer</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s processing and modifying information</p>
<p>is a good way to solve the problems of physics,</p>
<p>of chemistry, of biology,</p>
<p>and perhaps of humanity and so on.</p>
<p>Yes, I think understanding physics</p>
<p>in terms of information theory</p>
<p>might be the best way to really understand</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on here.</p>
<p>From our understanding of a universal Turing machine,</p>
<p>from our understanding of a computer,</p>
<p>do you think there&rsquo;s something outside</p>
<p>of the capabilities of a computer</p>
<p>that is present in our universe?</p>
<p>You have a disagreement with Roger Penrose</p>
<p>about the nature of consciousness.</p>
<p>He thinks that consciousness is more</p>
<p>than just a computation.</p>
<p>Do you think all of it, the whole shebangs,</p>
<p>can be a computation?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve had many fascinating debates</p>
<p>with Sir Roger Penrose,</p>
<p>and obviously he&rsquo;s famously,</p>
<p>and I read, you know, Emperors of the New Mind</p>
<p>and his books, his classical books,</p>
<p>and they were pretty influential in the 90s.</p>
<p>And he believes that there&rsquo;s something more,</p>
<p>something quantum that is needed</p>
<p>to explain consciousness in the brain.</p>
<p>I think about what we&rsquo;re doing actually at DeepMind</p>
<p>and what my career is being,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re almost like Turing&rsquo;s champion.</p>
<p>So we are pushing Turing machines or classical computation</p>
<p>to the limits.</p>
<p>What are the limits of what classical computing can do?</p>
<p>Now, and at the same time,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also studied neuroscience to see,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why I did my PhD in,</p>
<p>was to see, also to look at, you know,</p>
<p>is there anything quantum in the brain</p>
<p>from a neuroscience or biological perspective?</p>
<p>And so far, I think most neuroscientists</p>
<p>and most mainstream biologists and neuroscientists</p>
<p>would say there&rsquo;s no evidence of any quantum systems</p>
<p>or effects in the brain.</p>
<p>As far as we can see, it can be mostly explained</p>
<p>by classical theories.</p>
<p>So, and then, so there&rsquo;s sort of the search</p>
<p>from the biology side.</p>
<p>And then at the same time,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the raising of the water, the bar,</p>
<p>from what classical Turing machines can do.</p>
<p>And, you know, including our new AI systems.</p>
<p>And as you alluded to earlier, you know,</p>
<p>I think AI, especially in the last decade plus,</p>
<p>has been a continual story now of surprising events</p>
<p>and surprising successes,</p>
<p>knocking over one theory after another</p>
<p>of what was thought to be impossible, you know,</p>
<p>from Go to protein folding and so on.</p>
<p>And so I think I would be very hesitant</p>
<p>to bet against how far the universal Turing machine</p>
<p>and classical computation paradigm can go.</p>
<p>And my betting would be that all of,</p>
<p>certainly what&rsquo;s going on in our brain,</p>
<p>can probably be mimicked or approximated</p>
<p>on a classical machine,</p>
<p>not requiring something metaphysical or quantum.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll get there with some of the work with AlphaFold,</p>
<p>which I think begins the journey of modeling</p>
<p>this beautiful and complex world of biology.</p>
<p>So you think all the magic of the human mind</p>
<p>comes from this, just a few pounds of mush,</p>
<p>of biological computational mush,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s akin to some of the neural networks,</p>
<p>not directly, but in spirit</p>
<p>that DeepMind has been working with.</p>
<p>Well, look, I think it&rsquo;s, you say it&rsquo;s a few, you know,</p>
<p>of course it&rsquo;s, this is the,</p>
<p>I think the biggest miracle of the universe</p>
<p>is that it is just a few pounds of mush in our skulls.</p>
<p>And yet it&rsquo;s also our brains are the most complex objects</p>
<p>that we know of in the universe.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something profoundly beautiful</p>
<p>and amazing about our brains.</p>
<p>And I think that it&rsquo;s an incredibly,</p>
<p>incredible efficient machine.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, you know, phenomenon basically.</p>
<p>And I think that building AI,</p>
<p>one of the reasons I wanna build AI,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve always wanted to is,</p>
<p>I think by building an intelligent artifact like AI,</p>
<p>and then comparing it to the human mind,</p>
<p>that will help us unlock the uniqueness</p>
<p>and the true secrets of the mind</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve always wondered about since the dawn of history,</p>
<p>like consciousness, dreaming, creativity, emotions,</p>
<p>what are all these things, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve wondered about them since the dawn of humanity.</p>
<p>And I think one of the reasons,</p>
<p>and, you know, I love philosophy and philosophy of mind is,</p>
<p>we found it difficult is there haven&rsquo;t been the tools</p>
<p>for us to really, other than introspection,</p>
<p>from very clever people in history,</p>
<p>very clever philosophers,</p>
<p>to really investigate this scientifically.</p>
<p>But now suddenly we have a plethora of tools.</p>
<p>Firstly, we have all of the neuroscience tools,</p>
<p>fMRI machines, single cell recording, all of this stuff,</p>
<p>but we also have the ability, computers and AI,</p>
<p>to build intelligent systems.</p>
<p>So I think that, you know,</p>
<p>I think it is amazing what the human mind does.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m kind of in awe of it really.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s amazing that with our human minds,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re able to build things like computers</p>
<p>and actually even, you know,</p>
<p>think and investigate about these questions.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s also a testament to the human mind.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The universe built the human mind</p>
<p>that now is building computers that help us understand</p>
<p>both the universe and our own human mind.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>This is actually it.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that&rsquo;s one, you know,</p>
<p>one could say we are,</p>
<p>maybe we&rsquo;re the mechanism by which the universe</p>
<p>is going to try and understand itself.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go to the basic building blocks of biology</p>
<p>that I think is another angle at which you can start</p>
<p>to understand the human mind, the human body,</p>
<p>which is quite fascinating,</p>
<p>which is from the basic building blocks,</p>
<p>start to simulate, start to model</p>
<p>how from those building blocks,</p>
<p>you can construct bigger and bigger, more complex systems,</p>
<p>maybe one day the entirety of the human biology.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s another problem that thought</p>
<p>to be impossible to solve, which is protein folding.</p>
<p>And Alpha Fold or specifically Alpha Fold 2 did just that.</p>
<p>It solved protein folding.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s one of the biggest breakthroughs,</p>
<p>certainly in the history of structural biology,</p>
<p>but in general in science,</p>
<p>maybe from a high level, what is it and how does it work?</p>
<p>And then we can ask some fascinating questions after.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So maybe to explain it to people not familiar</p>
<p>with protein folding is, you know,</p>
<p>first of all, explain proteins, which is, you know,</p>
<p>proteins are essential to all life.</p>
<p>Every function in your body depends on proteins.</p>
<p>Sometimes they&rsquo;re called the workhorses of biology.</p>
<p>And if you look into them and I&rsquo;ve, you know,</p>
<p>obviously as part of Alpha Fold,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been researching proteins and structural biology</p>
<p>for the last few years, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re amazing little bio nano machines proteins.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re incredible if you actually watch little videos</p>
<p>of how they work, animations of how they work.</p>
<p>And proteins are specified by their genetic sequence</p>
<p>called the amino acid sequence.</p>
<p>So you can think of it as their genetic makeup.</p>
<p>And then in the body in nature,</p>
<p>they fold up into a 3D structure.</p>
<p>So you can think of it as a string of beads</p>
<p>and then they fold up into a ball.</p>
<p>Now, the key thing is you want to know</p>
<p>what that 3D structure is because the structure,</p>
<p>the 3D structure of a protein is what helps to determine</p>
<p>what does it do, the function it does in your body.</p>
<p>And also if you&rsquo;re interested in drugs or disease,</p>
<p>you need to understand that 3D structure</p>
<p>because if you want to target something</p>
<p>with a drug compound about to block something</p>
<p>the protein&rsquo;s doing, you need to understand</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s gonna bind on the surface of the protein.</p>
<p>So obviously in order to do that,</p>
<p>you need to understand the 3D structure.</p>
<p>So the structure is mapped to the function.</p>
<p>The structure is mapped to the function</p>
<p>and the structure is obviously somehow specified</p>
<p>by the amino acid sequence.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the, in essence, the protein folding problem is,</p>
<p>can you just from the amino acid sequence,</p>
<p>the one dimensional string of letters,</p>
<p>can you immediately computationally predict</p>
<p>the 3D structure?</p>
<p>And this has been a grand challenge in biology</p>
<p>for over 50 years.</p>
<p>So I think it was first articulated by Christian Anfinsen,</p>
<p>a Nobel prize winner in 1972,</p>
<p>as part of his Nobel prize winning lecture.</p>
<p>And he just speculated this should be possible</p>
<p>to go from the amino acid sequence to the 3D structure,</p>
<p>but he didn&rsquo;t say how.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s been described to me as equivalent</p>
<p>to Fermat&rsquo;s last theorem, but for biology.</p>
<p>You should, as somebody that very well might win</p>
<p>the Nobel prize in the future.</p>
<p>But outside of that, you should do more</p>
<p>of that kind of thing.</p>
<p>In the margin, just put random things</p>
<p>that will take like 200 years to solve.</p>
<p>Set people off for 200 years.</p>
<p>It should be possible.</p>
<p>And just don&rsquo;t give any details.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I think everyone exactly should be,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to remember that for future.</p>
<p>So yeah, so he set off, you know,</p>
<p>with this one throwaway remark, just like Fermat,</p>
<p>you know, he set off this whole 50 year field really</p>
<p>of computational biology.</p>
<p>And they had, you know, they got stuck.</p>
<p>They hadn&rsquo;t really got very far with doing this.</p>
<p>And until now, until AlphaFold came along,</p>
<p>this is done experimentally, right?</p>
<p>Very painstakingly.</p>
<p>So the rule of thumb is, and you have to like</p>
<p>crystallize the protein, which is really difficult.</p>
<p>Some proteins can&rsquo;t be crystallized like membrane proteins.</p>
<p>And then you have to use very expensive electron microscopes</p>
<p>or X ray crystallography machines.</p>
<p>Really painstaking work to get the 3D structure</p>
<p>and visualize the 3D structure.</p>
<p>So the rule of thumb in experimental biology</p>
<p>is that it takes one PhD student,</p>
<p>their entire PhD to do one protein.</p>
<p>And with AlphaFold 2, we were able to predict</p>
<p>the 3D structure in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>And so we were, you know, over Christmas,</p>
<p>we did the whole human proteome</p>
<p>or every protein in the human body or 20,000 proteins.</p>
<p>So the human proteomes like the equivalent</p>
<p>of the human genome, but on protein space.</p>
<p>And sort of revolutionized really</p>
<p>what a structural biologist can do.</p>
<p>Because now they don&rsquo;t have to worry</p>
<p>about these painstaking experimental,</p>
<p>should they put all of that effort in or not?</p>
<p>They can almost just look up the structure</p>
<p>of their proteins like a Google search.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a data set on which it&rsquo;s trained</p>
<p>and how to map this amino acid sequence.</p>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s incredible that a protein,</p>
<p>this little chemical computer is able to do</p>
<p>that computation itself in some kind of distributed way</p>
<p>and do it very quickly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a weird thing.</p>
<p>And they evolve that way because, you know,</p>
<p>in the beginning, I mean, that&rsquo;s a great invention,</p>
<p>just the protein itself.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s, I think, probably a history</p>
<p>of like they evolved to have many of these proteins</p>
<p>and those proteins figure out how to be computers themselves</p>
<p>in such a way that you can create structures</p>
<p>that can interact in complexes with each other</p>
<p>in order to form high level functions.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a weird system that they figured it out.</p>
<p>Well, for sure.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, maybe we should talk</p>
<p>about the origins of life too,</p>
<p>but proteins themselves, I think are magical</p>
<p>and incredible, as I said, little bio nano machines.</p>
<p>And actually Leventhal, who was another scientist,</p>
<p>a contemporary of Amphinson, he coined this Leventhal,</p>
<p>what became known as Leventhal&rsquo;s paradox,</p>
<p>which is exactly what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>He calculated roughly an average protein,</p>
<p>which is maybe 2000 amino acids base as long,</p>
<p>is can fold in maybe 10 to the power 300</p>
<p>different confirmations.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s 10 to the power 300 different ways</p>
<p>that protein could fold up.</p>
<p>And yet somehow in nature, physics solves this,</p>
<p>solves this in a matter of milliseconds.</p>
<p>So proteins fold up in your body in, you know,</p>
<p>sometimes in fractions of a second.</p>
<p>So physics is somehow solving that search problem.</p>
<p>And just to be clear, in many of these cases,</p>
<p>maybe you can correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s often a unique way for that sequence to form itself.</p>
<p>So among that huge number of possibilities,</p>
<p>it figures out a way how to stably,</p>
<p>in some cases there might be a misfunction, so on,</p>
<p>which leads to a lot of the disorders and stuff like that.</p>
<p>But most of the time it&rsquo;s a unique mapping</p>
<p>and that unique mapping is not obvious.</p>
<p>No, exactly.</p>
<p>Which is what the problem is.</p>
<p>Exactly, so there&rsquo;s a unique mapping usually in a healthy,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s healthy, and as you say in disease,</p>
<p>so for example, Alzheimer&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>one conjecture is that it&rsquo;s because of misfolded protein,</p>
<p>a protein that folds in the wrong way, amyloid beta protein.</p>
<p>So, and then because it folds in the wrong way,</p>
<p>it gets tangled up, right, in your neurons.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s super important to understand</p>
<p>both healthy functioning and also disease</p>
<p>is to understand, you know, what these things are doing</p>
<p>and how they&rsquo;re structuring.</p>
<p>Of course, the next step is sometimes proteins change shape</p>
<p>when they interact with something.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not just static necessarily in biology.</p>
<p>Maybe you can give some interesting,</p>
<p>so beautiful things to you about these early days</p>
<p>of AlphaFold, of solving this problem,</p>
<p>because unlike games, this is real physical systems</p>
<p>that are less amenable to self play type of mechanisms.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>The size of the data set is smaller</p>
<p>than you might otherwise like,</p>
<p>so you have to be very clever about certain things.</p>
<p>Is there something you could speak to</p>
<p>what was very hard to solve</p>
<p>and what are some beautiful aspects about the solution?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say AlphaFold is the most complex</p>
<p>and also probably most meaningful system</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve built so far.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s been an amazing time actually in the last,</p>
<p>you know, two, three years to see that come through</p>
<p>because as we talked about earlier, you know,</p>
<p>games is what we started on</p>
<p>building things like AlphaGo and AlphaZero,</p>
<p>but really the ultimate goal was to,</p>
<p>not just to crack games,</p>
<p>it was just to build,</p>
<p>use them to bootstrap general learning systems</p>
<p>we could then apply to real world challenges.</p>
<p>Specifically, my passion is scientific challenges</p>
<p>like protein folding.</p>
<p>And then AlphaFold of course</p>
<p>is our first big proof point of that.</p>
<p>And so, you know, in terms of the data</p>
<p>and the amount of innovations that had to go into it,</p>
<p>we, you know, it was like</p>
<p>more than 30 different component algorithms</p>
<p>needed to be put together to crack the protein folding.</p>
<p>I think some of the big innovations were that</p>
<p>kind of building in some hard coded constraints</p>
<p>around physics and evolutionary biology</p>
<p>to constrain sort of things like the bond angles</p>
<p>in the protein and things like that,</p>
<p>a lot, but not to impact the learning system.</p>
<p>So still allowing the system to be able to learn</p>
<p>the physics itself from the examples that we had.</p>
<p>And the examples, as you say,</p>
<p>there are only about 150,000 proteins,</p>
<p>even after 40 years of experimental biology,</p>
<p>only around 150,000 proteins have been,</p>
<p>the structures have been found out about.</p>
<p>So that was our training set,</p>
<p>which is much less than normally we would like to use,</p>
<p>but using various tricks, things like self distillation.</p>
<p>So actually using AlphaFold predictions,</p>
<p>some of the best predictions</p>
<p>that it thought was highly confident in,</p>
<p>we put them back into the training set, right?</p>
<p>To make the training set bigger,</p>
<p>that was critical to AlphaFold working.</p>
<p>So there was actually a huge number</p>
<p>of different innovations like that,</p>
<p>that were required to ultimately crack the problem.</p>
<p>AlphaFold one, what it produced was a distrogram.</p>
<p>So a kind of a matrix of the pairwise distances</p>
<p>between all of the molecules in the protein.</p>
<p>And then there had to be a separate optimization process</p>
<p>to create the 3D structure.</p>
<p>And what we did for AlphaFold two</p>
<p>is make it truly end to end.</p>
<p>So we went straight from the amino acid sequence of bases</p>
<p>to the 3D structure directly</p>
<p>without going through this intermediate step.</p>
<p>And in machine learning, what we&rsquo;ve always found is</p>
<p>that the more end to end you can make it,</p>
<p>the better the system.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably because in the end,</p>
<p>the system&rsquo;s better at learning what the constraints are</p>
<p>than we are as the human designers of specifying it.</p>
<p>So anytime you can let it flow end to end</p>
<p>and actually just generate what it is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really looking for, in this case, the 3D structure,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re better off than having this intermediate step,</p>
<p>which you then have to handcraft the next step for.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s better to let the gradients and the learning</p>
<p>flow all the way through the system from the end point,</p>
<p>the end output you want to the inputs.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a good way to start on a new problem.</p>
<p>Handcraft a bunch of stuff,</p>
<p>add a bunch of manual constraints</p>
<p>with a small end to end learning piece</p>
<p>or a small learning piece and grow that learning piece</p>
<p>until it consumes the whole thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And so you can also see,</p>
<p>this is a bit of a method we&rsquo;ve developed</p>
<p>over doing many sort of successful alpha,</p>
<p>we call them alpha X projects, right?</p>
<p>And the easiest way to see that is the evolution</p>
<p>of alpha go to alpha zero.</p>
<p>So alpha go was a learning system,</p>
<p>but it was specifically trained to only play go, right?</p>
<p>So, and what we wanted to do with first version of alpha go</p>
<p>is just get to world champion performance</p>
<p>no matter how we did it, right?</p>
<p>And then of course, alpha go zero,</p>
<p>we remove the need to use human games as a starting point,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>So it could just play against itself</p>
<p>from random starting point from the beginning.</p>
<p>So that removed the need for human knowledge about go.</p>
<p>And then finally alpha zero then generalized it</p>
<p>so that any things we had in there, the system,</p>
<p>including things like symmetry of the go board were removed.</p>
<p>So the alpha zero could play from scratch</p>
<p>any two player game and then mu zero,</p>
<p>which is the final, our latest version</p>
<p>of that set of things was then extending it</p>
<p>so that you didn&rsquo;t even have to give it</p>
<p>the rules of the game.</p>
<p>It would learn that for itself.</p>
<p>So it could also deal with computer games</p>
<p>as well as board games.</p>
<p>So that line of alpha go, alpha go zero, alpha zero,</p>
<p>mu zero, that&rsquo;s the full trajectory</p>
<p>of what you can take from imitation learning</p>
<p>to full self supervised learning.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And learning the entire structure</p>
<p>of the environment you&rsquo;re put in from scratch, right?</p>
<p>And bootstrapping it through self play yourself.</p>
<p>But the thing is it would have been impossible, I think,</p>
<p>or very hard for us to build alpha zero</p>
<p>or mu zero first out of the box.</p>
<p>Even psychologically, because you have to believe</p>
<p>in yourself for a very long time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re constantly dealing with doubt</p>
<p>because a lot of people say that it&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
<p>Exactly, so it&rsquo;s hard enough just to do go.</p>
<p>As you were saying, everyone thought that was impossible</p>
<p>or at least a decade away from when we did it</p>
<p>back in 2015, 2016.</p>
<p>And so yes, it would have been psychologically</p>
<p>probably very difficult as well as the fact</p>
<p>that of course we learn a lot by building alpha go first.</p>
<p>Right, so I think this is why I call AI</p>
<p>an engineering science.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the most fascinating science disciplines,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also an engineering science in the sense</p>
<p>that unlike natural sciences, the phenomenon you&rsquo;re studying</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t exist out in nature.</p>
<p>You have to build it first.</p>
<p>So you have to build the artifact first,</p>
<p>and then you can study and pull it apart and how it works.</p>
<p>This is tough to ask you this question</p>
<p>because you probably will say it&rsquo;s everything,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s try to think through this</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re in a very interesting position</p>
<p>where DeepMind is a place of some of the most brilliant</p>
<p>ideas in the history of AI,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also a place of brilliant engineering.</p>
<p>So how much of solving intelligence,</p>
<p>this big goal for DeepMind,</p>
<p>how much of it is science?</p>
<p>How much is engineering?</p>
<p>So how much is the algorithms?</p>
<p>How much is the data?</p>
<p>How much is the hardware compute infrastructure?</p>
<p>How much is it the software compute infrastructure?</p>
<p>What else is there?</p>
<p>How much is the human infrastructure?</p>
<p>And like just the humans interacting certain kinds of ways</p>
<p>in all the space of all those ideas.</p>
<p>And how much is maybe like philosophy?</p>
<p>How much, what&rsquo;s the key?</p>
<p>If you were to sort of look back,</p>
<p>like if we go forward 200 years and look back,</p>
<p>what was the key thing that solved intelligence?</p>
<p>Is it the ideas or the engineering?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a combination.</p>
<p>First of all, of course,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a combination of all those things,</p>
<p>but the ratios of them changed over time.</p>
<p>So even in the last 12 years,</p>
<p>so we started DeepMind in 2010,</p>
<p>which is hard to imagine now because 2010,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only 12 short years ago,</p>
<p>but nobody was talking about AI.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you remember back to your MIT days,</p>
<p>no one was talking about it.</p>
<p>I did a postdoc at MIT back around then.</p>
<p>And it was sort of thought of as a,</p>
<p>well, look, we know AI doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>We tried this hard in the 90s at places like MIT,</p>
<p>mostly using logic systems and old fashioned,</p>
<p>sort of good old fashioned AI, we would call it now.</p>
<p>People like Minsky and Patrick Winston,</p>
<p>and you know all these characters, right?</p>
<p>And used to debate a few of them.</p>
<p>And they used to think I was mad thinking about</p>
<p>that some new advance could be done with learning systems.</p>
<p>And I was actually pleased to hear that</p>
<p>because at least you know you&rsquo;re on a unique track</p>
<p>at that point, right?</p>
<p>Even if all of your professors are telling you you&rsquo;re mad.</p>
<p>And of course in industry,</p>
<p>we couldn&rsquo;t get, it was difficult to get two cents together,</p>
<p>which is hard to imagine now as well,</p>
<p>given that it&rsquo;s the biggest sort of buzzword in VCs</p>
<p>and fundraisings easy and all these kinds of things today.</p>
<p>So back in 2010, it was very difficult.</p>
<p>And the reason we started then,</p>
<p>and Shane and I used to discuss</p>
<p>what were the sort of founding tenants of DeepMind.</p>
<p>And it was various things.</p>
<p>One was algorithmic advances.</p>
<p>So deep learning, you know,</p>
<p>Jeff Hinton and Co had just sort of invented that</p>
<p>in academia, but no one in industry knew about it.</p>
<p>We love reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>We thought that could be scaled up.</p>
<p>But also understanding about the human brain</p>
<p>had advanced quite a lot in the decade prior</p>
<p>with fMRI machines and other things.</p>
<p>So we could get some good hints about architectures</p>
<p>and algorithms and sort of representations maybe</p>
<p>that the brain uses.</p>
<p>So at a systems level, not at a implementation level.</p>
<p>And then the other big things were compute and GPUs, right?</p>
<p>So we could see a compute was going to be really useful</p>
<p>and had got to a place where it become commoditized</p>
<p>mostly through the games industry</p>
<p>and that could be taken advantage of.</p>
<p>And then the final thing was also mathematical</p>
<p>and theoretical definitions of intelligence.</p>
<p>So things like AIXI, AIXE,</p>
<p>which Shane worked on with his supervisor, Marcus Hutter,</p>
<p>which is this sort of theoretical proof really</p>
<p>of universal intelligence,</p>
<p>which is actually a reinforcement learning system</p>
<p>in the limit.</p>
<p>I mean, it assumes infinite compute and infinite memory</p>
<p>in the way, you know, like a Turing machine proves.</p>
<p>But I was also waiting to see something like that too,</p>
<p>to, you know, like Turing machines and computation theory</p>
<p>that people like Turing and Shannon came up with</p>
<p>underpins modern computer science.</p>
<p>You know, I was waiting for a theory like that</p>
<p>to sort of underpin AGI research.</p>
<p>So when I, you know, met Shane</p>
<p>and saw he was working on something like that,</p>
<p>you know, that to me was a sort of final piece</p>
<p>of the jigsaw.</p>
<p>So in the early days, I would say that ideas</p>
<p>were the most important.</p>
<p>You know, for us, it was deep reinforcement learning,</p>
<p>scaling up deep learning.</p>
<p>Of course, we&rsquo;ve seen transformers.</p>
<p>So huge leaps, I would say, you know, three or four</p>
<p>from, if you think from 2010 till now,</p>
<p>huge evolutions, things like AlphaGo.</p>
<p>And maybe there&rsquo;s a few more still needed.</p>
<p>But as we get closer to AI, AGI,</p>
<p>I think engineering becomes more and more important</p>
<p>and data because scale and of course the recent,</p>
<p>you know, results of GPT3 and all the big language models</p>
<p>and large models, including our ones,</p>
<p>has shown that scale and large models</p>
<p>are clearly gonna be a necessary,</p>
<p>but perhaps not sufficient part of an AGI solution.</p>
<p>And throughout that, like you said,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d like to give you a big thank you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of the pioneers in this is sticking by ideas</p>
<p>like reinforcement learning, that this can actually work</p>
<p>given actually limited success in the past.</p>
<p>And also, which we still don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but proudly having the best researchers in the world</p>
<p>and talking about solving intelligence.</p>
<p>So talking about whatever you call it,</p>
<p>AGI or something like this, speaking of MIT,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just something you wouldn&rsquo;t bring up.</p>
<p>Not maybe you did in like 40, 50 years ago,</p>
<p>but that was, AI was a place where you do tinkering,</p>
<p>very small scale, not very ambitious projects.</p>
<p>And maybe the biggest ambitious projects</p>
<p>were in the space of robotics</p>
<p>and doing like the DARPA challenge.</p>
<p>But the task of solving intelligence and believing you can,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really, really powerful.</p>
<p>So in order for engineering to do its work,</p>
<p>to have great engineers, build great systems,</p>
<p>you have to have that belief,</p>
<p>that threads throughout the whole thing</p>
<p>that you can actually solve</p>
<p>some of these impossible challenges.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And back in 2010, our mission statement and still is today,</p>
<p>it was used to be solving step one, solve intelligence,</p>
<p>step two, use it to solve everything else.</p>
<p>So if you can imagine pitching that to a VC in 2010,</p>
<p>the kind of looks we got,</p>
<p>we managed to find a few kooky people to back us,</p>
<p>but it was tricky.</p>
<p>And it got to the point where we wouldn&rsquo;t mention it</p>
<p>to any of our professors because they would just eye roll</p>
<p>and think we committed career suicide.</p>
<p>And so it was, there&rsquo;s a lot of things that we had to do,</p>
<p>but we always believed it.</p>
<p>And one reason, by the way,</p>
<p>one reason I&rsquo;ve always believed in reinforcement learning</p>
<p>is that if you look at neuroscience,</p>
<p>that is the way that the primate brain learns.</p>
<p>One of the main mechanisms is the dopamine system</p>
<p>implements some form of TD learning.</p>
<p>It was a very famous result in the late 90s</p>
<p>where they saw this in monkeys</p>
<p>and as a propagating prediction error.</p>
<p>So again, in the limit,</p>
<p>this is what I think you can use neuroscience for is,</p>
<p>at mathematics, when you&rsquo;re doing something as ambitious</p>
<p>as trying to solve intelligence</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s blue sky research, no one knows how to do it,</p>
<p>you need to use any evidence</p>
<p>or any source of information you can</p>
<p>to help guide you in the right direction</p>
<p>or give you confidence you&rsquo;re going in the right direction.</p>
<p>So that was one reason we pushed so hard on that.</p>
<p>And just going back to your earlier question</p>
<p>about organization, the other big thing</p>
<p>that I think we innovated with at DeepMind</p>
<p>to encourage invention and innovation</p>
<p>was the multidisciplinary organization we built</p>
<p>and we still have today.</p>
<p>So DeepMind originally was a confluence</p>
<p>of the most cutting edge knowledge in neuroscience</p>
<p>with machine learning, engineering and mathematics, right?</p>
<p>And gaming.</p>
<p>And then since then we&rsquo;ve built that out even further.</p>
<p>So we have philosophers here and ethicists,</p>
<p>but also other types of scientists, physicists and so on.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what brings together,</p>
<p>I tried to build a sort of new type of Bell Labs,</p>
<p>but in its golden era, right?</p>
<p>And a new expression of that to try and foster</p>
<p>this incredible sort of innovation machine.</p>
<p>So talking about the humans in the machine,</p>
<p>DeepMind itself is a learning machine</p>
<p>with lots of amazing human minds in it</p>
<p>coming together to try and build these learning systems.</p>
<p>If we return to the big ambitious dream of AlphaFold,</p>
<p>that may be the early steps on a very long journey</p>
<p>in biology, do you think the same kind of approach</p>
<p>can use to predict the structure and function</p>
<p>of more complex biological systems?</p>
<p>So multi protein interaction,</p>
<p>and then, I mean, you can go out from there,</p>
<p>just simulating bigger and bigger systems</p>
<p>that eventually simulate something like the human brain</p>
<p>or the human body, just the big mush,</p>
<p>the mess of the beautiful, resilient mess of biology.</p>
<p>Do you see that as a long term vision?</p>
<p>I do, and I think, if you think about</p>
<p>what are the top things I wanted to apply AI to</p>
<p>once we had powerful enough systems,</p>
<p>biology and curing diseases and understanding biology</p>
<p>was right up there, top of my list.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the reasons I personally pushed that myself</p>
<p>and with AlphaFold, but I think AlphaFold,</p>
<p>amazing as it is, is just the beginning.</p>
<p>And I hope it&rsquo;s evidence of what could be done</p>
<p>with computational methods.</p>
<p>So AlphaFold solved this huge problem</p>
<p>of the structure of proteins, but biology is dynamic.</p>
<p>So really what I imagine from here,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re working on all these things now,</p>
<p>is protein, protein interaction, protein ligand binding,</p>
<p>so reacting with molecules,</p>
<p>then you wanna build up to pathways,</p>
<p>and then eventually a virtual cell.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my dream, maybe in the next 10 years.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been talking actually</p>
<p>to a lot of biologists, friends of mine,</p>
<p>Paul Nurse, who runs the Crick Institute,</p>
<p>amazing biologists, Nobel Prize winning biologists.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been discussing for 20 years now, virtual cells.</p>
<p>Could you build a virtual simulation of a cell?</p>
<p>And if you could, that would be incredible</p>
<p>for biology and disease discovery,</p>
<p>because you could do loads of experiments</p>
<p>on the virtual cell, and then only at the last stage,</p>
<p>validate it in the wet lab.</p>
<p>So you could, in terms of the search space</p>
<p>of discovering new drugs, it takes 10 years roughly</p>
<p>to go from identifying a target,</p>
<p>to having a drug candidate.</p>
<p>Maybe that could be shortened by an order of magnitude,</p>
<p>if you could do most of that work in silico.</p>
<p>So in order to get to a virtual cell,</p>
<p>we have to build up understanding</p>
<p>of different parts of biology and the interactions.</p>
<p>And so every few years we talk about this,</p>
<p>I talked about this with Paul.</p>
<p>And then finally, last year after AlphaFold,</p>
<p>I said, now&rsquo;s the time we can finally go for it.</p>
<p>And AlphaFold is the first proof point</p>
<p>that this might be possible.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s very excited, and we have some collaborations</p>
<p>with his lab, they&rsquo;re just across the road actually</p>
<p>from us, it&rsquo;s wonderful being here in King&rsquo;s Cross</p>
<p>with the Crick Institute across the road.</p>
<p>And I think the next steps,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s gonna be some amazing advances</p>
<p>in biology built on top of things like AlphaFold.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re already seeing that with the community doing that</p>
<p>after we&rsquo;ve open sourced it and released it.</p>
<p>And I often say that I think if you think of mathematics</p>
<p>is the perfect description language for physics,</p>
<p>I think AI might be end up being</p>
<p>the perfect description language for biology</p>
<p>because biology is so messy, it&rsquo;s so emergent,</p>
<p>so dynamic and complex.</p>
<p>I think I find it very hard to believe</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll ever get to something as elegant</p>
<p>as Newton&rsquo;s laws of motions to describe a cell, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just too complicated.</p>
<p>So I think AI is the right tool for that.</p>
<p>So you have to start at the basic building blocks</p>
<p>and use AI to run the simulation</p>
<p>for all those building blocks.</p>
<p>So have a very strong way to do prediction</p>
<p>of what given these building blocks,</p>
<p>what kind of biology, how the function</p>
<p>and the evolution of that biological system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a cellular automata,</p>
<p>you have to run it, you can&rsquo;t analyze it from a high level.</p>
<p>You have to take the basic ingredients,</p>
<p>figure out the rules and let it run.</p>
<p>But in this case, the rules are very difficult</p>
<p>to figure out, you have to learn them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly it.</p>
<p>So the biology is too complicated to figure out the rules.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too emergent, too dynamic,</p>
<p>say compared to a physics system,</p>
<p>like the motion of a planet, right?</p>
<p>And so you have to learn the rules</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s exactly the type of systems that we&rsquo;re building.</p>
<p>So you mentioned you&rsquo;ve open sourced AlphaFold</p>
<p>and even the data involved.</p>
<p>To me personally, also really happy</p>
<p>and a big thank you for open sourcing Mojoko,</p>
<p>the physics simulation engine that&rsquo;s often used</p>
<p>for robotics research and so on.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s a pretty gangster move.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the, I mean, very few companies</p>
<p>or people do that kind of thing.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the philosophy behind that?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a case by case basis.</p>
<p>And in both of those cases,</p>
<p>we felt that was the maximum benefit to humanity to do that.</p>
<p>And the scientific community, in one case,</p>
<p>the robotics physics community with Mojoko, so.</p>
<p>We purchased it.</p>
<p>We purchased it for, yes,</p>
<p>we purchased it for the express principle to open source it.</p>
<p>So, you know, I hope people appreciate that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great to hear that you do.</p>
<p>And then the second thing was,</p>
<p>and mostly we did it because the person building it</p>
<p>was not able to cope with supporting it anymore</p>
<p>because it got too big for him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an amazing professor who built it in the first place.</p>
<p>So we helped him out with that.</p>
<p>And then with AlphaFold is even bigger, I would say.</p>
<p>And I think in that case,</p>
<p>we decided that there were so many downstream applications</p>
<p>of AlphaFold that we couldn&rsquo;t possibly even imagine</p>
<p>what they all were.</p>
<p>So the best way to accelerate drug discovery</p>
<p>and also fundamental research would be to give all</p>
<p>that data away and the system itself.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s been so gratifying to see</p>
<p>what people have done that within just one year,</p>
<p>which is a short amount of time in science.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been used by over 500,000 researchers have used it.</p>
<p>We think that&rsquo;s almost every biologist in the world.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s roughly 500,000 biologists in the world,</p>
<p>professional biologists,</p>
<p>have used it to look at their proteins of interest.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen amazing fundamental research done.</p>
<p>So a couple of weeks ago, front cover,</p>
<p>there was a whole special issue of science,</p>
<p>including the front cover,</p>
<p>which had the nuclear pore complex on it,</p>
<p>which is one of the biggest proteins in the body.</p>
<p>The nuclear pore complex is a protein that governs</p>
<p>all the nutrients going in and out of your cell nucleus.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re like little gateways that open and close</p>
<p>to let things go in and out of your cell nucleus.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re really important, but they&rsquo;re huge</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re massive donut ring shaped things.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve been looking to try and figure out</p>
<p>that structure for decades.</p>
<p>And they have lots of experimental data,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s too low resolution, there&rsquo;s bits missing.</p>
<p>And they were able to, like a giant Lego jigsaw puzzle,</p>
<p>use alpha fold predictions plus experimental data</p>
<p>and combined those two independent sources of information,</p>
<p>actually four different groups around the world</p>
<p>were able to put it together more or less simultaneously</p>
<p>using alpha fold predictions.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s been amazing to see.</p>
<p>And pretty much every pharma company,</p>
<p>every drug company executive I&rsquo;ve spoken to</p>
<p>has said that their teams are using alpha fold</p>
<p>to accelerate whatever drugs they&rsquo;re trying to discover.</p>
<p>So I think the knock on effect has been enormous</p>
<p>in terms of the impact that alpha fold has made.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably bringing in, it&rsquo;s creating biologists,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s bringing more people into the field,</p>
<p>both on the excitement and both on the technical skills</p>
<p>involved in, it&rsquo;s almost like a gateway drug to biology.</p>
<p>Yes, it is.</p>
<p>And to get more computational people involved too, hopefully.</p>
<p>And I think for us, the next stage, as I said,</p>
<p>in future we have to have other considerations too.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re building on top of alpha fold</p>
<p>and these other ideas I discussed with you</p>
<p>about protein interactions and genomics and other things.</p>
<p>And not everything will be open source.</p>
<p>Some of it we&rsquo;ll do commercially</p>
<p>because that will be the best way</p>
<p>to actually get the most resources and impact behind it.</p>
<p>In other ways, some other projects</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll do nonprofit style.</p>
<p>And also we have to consider for future things as well,</p>
<p>safety and ethics as well.</p>
<p>Like synthetic biology, there is dual use.</p>
<p>And we have to think about that as well.</p>
<p>With alpha fold, we consulted with 30 different bioethicists</p>
<p>and other people expert in this field</p>
<p>to make sure it was safe before we released it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;ll be other considerations in future.</p>
<p>But for right now, I think alpha fold</p>
<p>is a kind of a gift from us to the scientific community.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m pretty sure that something like alpha fold</p>
<p>will be part of Nobel prizes in the future.</p>
<p>But us humans, of course,</p>
<p>are horrible with credit assignment.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll of course give it to the humans.</p>
<p>Do you think there will be a day</p>
<p>when AI system can&rsquo;t be denied</p>
<p>that it earned that Nobel prize?</p>
<p>Do you think we will see that in 21st century?</p>
<p>It depends what type of AIs we end up building, right?</p>
<p>Whether they&rsquo;re goal seeking agents</p>
<p>who specifies the goals, who comes up with the hypotheses,</p>
<p>who determines which problems to tackle, right?</p>
<p>So I think&hellip;</p>
<p>And tweets about it, announcement of the results.</p>
<p>Yes, and tweets about results exactly as part of it.</p>
<p>So I think right now, of course,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing human ingenuity that&rsquo;s behind these systems.</p>
<p>And then the system, in my opinion, is just a tool.</p>
<p>Be a bit like saying with Galileo and his telescope,</p>
<p>the ingenuity that the credit should go to the telescope.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s clearly Galileo building the tool</p>
<p>which he then uses.</p>
<p>So I still see that in the same way today,</p>
<p>even though these tools learn for themselves.</p>
<p>There, I think of things like alpha fold</p>
<p>and the things we&rsquo;re building as the ultimate tools</p>
<p>for science and for acquiring new knowledge</p>
<p>to help us as scientists acquire new knowledge.</p>
<p>I think one day there will come a point</p>
<p>where an AI system may solve</p>
<p>or come up with something like general relativity</p>
<p>of its own bat, not just by averaging everything</p>
<p>on the internet or averaging everything on PubMed,</p>
<p>although that would be interesting to see</p>
<p>what that would come up with.</p>
<p>So that to me is a bit like our earlier debate</p>
<p>about creativity, you know, inventing go</p>
<p>rather than just coming up with a good go move.</p>
<p>And so I think solving, I think to, you know,</p>
<p>if we wanted to give it the credit</p>
<p>of like a Nobel type of thing,</p>
<p>then it would need to invent go</p>
<p>and sort of invent that new conjecture out of the blue</p>
<p>rather than being specified by the human scientists</p>
<p>or the human creators.</p>
<p>So I think right now it&rsquo;s definitely just a tool.</p>
<p>Although it is interesting how far you get</p>
<p>by averaging everything on the internet, like you said,</p>
<p>because, you know, a lot of people do see science</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re always standing on the shoulders of giants.</p>
<p>And the question is how much are you really reaching</p>
<p>up above the shoulders of giants?</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just simulating different kinds</p>
<p>of results of the past with ultimately this new perspective</p>
<p>that gives you this breakthrough idea.</p>
<p>But that idea may not be novel in the way</p>
<p>that it can&rsquo;t be already discovered on the internet.</p>
<p>Maybe the Nobel prizes of the next 100 years</p>
<p>are already all there on the internet to be discovered.</p>
<p>They could be, they could be.</p>
<p>I mean, I think this is one of the big mysteries,</p>
<p>I think is that I, first of all,</p>
<p>I believe a lot of the big new breakthroughs</p>
<p>that are gonna come in the next few decades</p>
<p>and even in the last decade are gonna come</p>
<p>at the intersection between different subject areas</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;ll be some new connection that&rsquo;s found</p>
<p>between what seemingly were disparate areas.</p>
<p>And one can even think of DeepMind, as I said earlier,</p>
<p>as a sort of interdisciplinary between neuroscience ideas</p>
<p>and AI engineering ideas originally.</p>
<p>And so I think there&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>And then one of the things we can&rsquo;t imagine today is,</p>
<p>and one of the reasons I think people,</p>
<p>we were so surprised by how well large models worked</p>
<p>is that actually it&rsquo;s very hard for our human minds,</p>
<p>our limited human minds to understand</p>
<p>what it would be like to read the whole internet, right?</p>
<p>I think we can do a thought experiment</p>
<p>and I used to do this of like,</p>
<p>well, what if I read the whole of Wikipedia?</p>
<p>What would I know?</p>
<p>And I think our minds can just about comprehend</p>
<p>maybe what that would be like,</p>
<p>but the whole internet is beyond comprehension.</p>
<p>So I think we just don&rsquo;t understand what it would be like</p>
<p>to be able to hold all of that in mind potentially, right?</p>
<p>And then active at once,</p>
<p>and then maybe what are the connections</p>
<p>that are available there?</p>
<p>So I think no doubt there are huge things</p>
<p>to be discovered just like that.</p>
<p>But I do think there is this other type of creativity</p>
<p>of true spark of new knowledge, new idea,</p>
<p>never thought before about,</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be averaged from things that are known,</p>
<p>that really, of course, everything come,</p>
<p>nobody creates in a vacuum,</p>
<p>so there must be clues somewhere,</p>
<p>but just a unique way of putting those things together.</p>
<p>I think some of the greatest scientists in history</p>
<p>have displayed that I would say,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s very hard to know going back to their time,</p>
<p>what was exactly known when they came up with those things.</p>
<p>Although you&rsquo;re making me really think because just a thought</p>
<p>experiment of deeply knowing a hundred Wikipedia pages.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I can,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been really impressed by Wikipedia for technical topics.</p>
<p>So if you know a hundred pages or a thousand pages,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we can truly comprehend</p>
<p>what kind of intelligence that is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty powerful intelligence.</p>
<p>If you know how to use that</p>
<p>and integrate that information correctly,</p>
<p>I think you can go really far.</p>
<p>You can probably construct thought experiments</p>
<p>based on that, like simulate different ideas.</p>
<p>So if this is true, let me run this thought experiment</p>
<p>that maybe this is true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really invention.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like just taking literally the knowledge</p>
<p>and using it to construct the very basic simulation</p>
<p>of the world.</p>
<p>I mean, some argue it&rsquo;s romantic in part,</p>
<p>but Einstein would do the same kind of things</p>
<p>with a thought experiment.</p>
<p>Yeah, one could imagine doing that systematically</p>
<p>across millions of Wikipedia pages,</p>
<p>plus PubMed, all these things.</p>
<p>I think there are many, many things to be discovered</p>
<p>like that that are hugely useful.</p>
<p>You could imagine,</p>
<p>and I want us to do some of these things in material science</p>
<p>like room temperature superconductors</p>
<p>is something on my list one day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to have an AI system to help build</p>
<p>better optimized batteries,</p>
<p>all of these sort of mechanical things.</p>
<p>I think a systematic sort of search</p>
<p>could be guided by a model,</p>
<p>could be extremely powerful.</p>
<p>So speaking of which,</p>
<p>you have a paper on nuclear fusion,</p>
<p>magnetic control of tachymic plasmas</p>
<p>through deep reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re seeking to solve nuclear fusion with deep RL.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s doing control of high temperature plasmas.</p>
<p>Can you explain this work</p>
<p>and can AI eventually solve nuclear fusion?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been very fun last year or two and very productive</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve been taking off a lot of my dream projects,</p>
<p>if you like, of things that I&rsquo;ve collected</p>
<p>over the years of areas of science</p>
<p>that I would like to,</p>
<p>I think could be very transformative if we helped accelerate</p>
<p>and really interesting problems,</p>
<p>scientific challenges in of themselves.</p>
<p>So this is energy.</p>
<p>So energy, yes, exactly.</p>
<p>So energy and climate.</p>
<p>So we talked about disease and biology</p>
<p>as being one of the biggest places I think AI can help with.</p>
<p>I think energy and climate is another one.</p>
<p>So maybe they would be my top two.</p>
<p>And fusion is one area I think AI can help with.</p>
<p>Now, fusion has many challenges,</p>
<p>mostly physics and material science</p>
<p>and engineering challenges as well</p>
<p>to build these massive fusion reactors</p>
<p>and contain the plasma.</p>
<p>And what we try to do,</p>
<p>and whenever we go into a new field to apply our systems,</p>
<p>is we look for, we talk to domain experts.</p>
<p>We try and find the best people in the world</p>
<p>to collaborate with.</p>
<p>In this case, in fusion,</p>
<p>we collaborated with EPFL in Switzerland,</p>
<p>the Swiss Technical Institute, who are amazing.</p>
<p>They have a test reactor.</p>
<p>They were willing to let us use,</p>
<p>which I double checked with the team</p>
<p>we were gonna use carefully and safely.</p>
<p>I was impressed they managed to persuade them</p>
<p>to let us use it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an amazing test reactor they have there.</p>
<p>And they try all sorts of pretty crazy experiments on it.</p>
<p>And what we tend to look at is,</p>
<p>if we go into a new domain like fusion,</p>
<p>what are all the bottleneck problems?</p>
<p>Like thinking from first principles,</p>
<p>what are all the bottleneck problems</p>
<p>that are still stopping fusion working today?</p>
<p>And then we look at, we get a fusion expert to tell us,</p>
<p>and then we look at those bottlenecks</p>
<p>and we look at the ones,</p>
<p>which ones are amenable to our AI methods today, right?</p>
<p>And would be interesting from a research perspective,</p>
<p>from our point of view, from an AI point of view,</p>
<p>and that would address one of their bottlenecks.</p>
<p>And in this case, plasma control was perfect.</p>
<p>So, the plasma, it&rsquo;s a million degrees Celsius,</p>
<p>something like that, it&rsquo;s hotter than the sun.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s obviously no material that can contain it.</p>
<p>So, they have to be containing these magnetic,</p>
<p>very powerful and superconducting magnetic fields.</p>
<p>But the problem is plasma,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty unstable as you imagine,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind of holding a mini sun, mini star in a reactor.</p>
<p>So, you kind of want to predict ahead of time,</p>
<p>what the plasma is gonna do.</p>
<p>So, you can move the magnetic field</p>
<p>within a few milliseconds,</p>
<p>to basically contain what it&rsquo;s gonna do next.</p>
<p>So, it seems like a perfect problem if you think of it</p>
<p>for like a reinforcement learning prediction problem.</p>
<p>So, you got controller, you&rsquo;re gonna move the magnetic field.</p>
<p>And until we came along, they were doing it</p>
<p>with traditional operational research type of controllers,</p>
<p>which are kind of handcrafted.</p>
<p>And the problem is, of course,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t react in the moment</p>
<p>to something the plasma is doing,</p>
<p>they have to be hard coded.</p>
<p>And again, knowing that that&rsquo;s normally our go to solution</p>
<p>is we would like to learn that instead.</p>
<p>And they also had a simulator of these plasma.</p>
<p>So, there were lots of criteria</p>
<p>that matched what we like to use.</p>
<p>So, can AI eventually solve nuclear fusion?</p>
<p>Well, so with this problem,</p>
<p>and we published it in a nature paper last year,</p>
<p>we held the fusion, we held the plasma in a specific shapes.</p>
<p>So, actually, it&rsquo;s almost like carving the plasma</p>
<p>into different shapes and hold it there</p>
<p>for a record amount of time.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s one of the problems of fusion sort of solved.</p>
<p>So, have a controller that&rsquo;s able to,</p>
<p>no matter the shape.</p>
<p>Contain it. Contain it.</p>
<p>Yeah, contain it and hold it in structure.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s different shapes that are better</p>
<p>for the energy productions called droplets and so on.</p>
<p>So, that was huge.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re looking,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking to lots of fusion startups</p>
<p>to see what&rsquo;s the next problem we can tackle</p>
<p>in the fusion area.</p>
<p>So, another fascinating place in a paper titled,</p>
<p>Pushing the Frontiers of Density Functionals</p>
<p>by Solving the Fractional Electron Problem.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;re taking on modeling and simulating</p>
<p>the quantum mechanical behavior of electrons.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Can you explain this work and can AI model</p>
<p>and simulate arbitrary quantum mechanical systems</p>
<p>in the future?</p>
<p>Yeah, so this is another problem I&rsquo;ve had my eye on</p>
<p>for a decade or more,</p>
<p>which is sort of simulating the properties of electrons.</p>
<p>If you can do that, you can basically describe</p>
<p>how elements and materials and substances work.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s kind of like fundamental</p>
<p>if you want to advance material science.</p>
<p>And we have Schrodinger&rsquo;s equation</p>
<p>and then we have approximations</p>
<p>to that density functional theory.</p>
<p>These things are famous.</p>
<p>And people try and write approximations</p>
<p>to these functionals and kind of come up</p>
<p>with descriptions of the electron clouds,</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re going to go,</p>
<p>how they&rsquo;re going to interact</p>
<p>when you put two elements together.</p>
<p>And what we try to do is learn a simulation,</p>
<p>learn a functional that will describe more chemistry,</p>
<p>types of chemistry.</p>
<p>So, until now, you can run expensive simulations,</p>
<p>but then you can only simulate very small molecules,</p>
<p>very simple molecules.</p>
<p>We would like to simulate large materials.</p>
<p>And so, today there&rsquo;s no way of doing that.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re building up towards building functionals</p>
<p>that approximate Schrodinger&rsquo;s equation</p>
<p>and then allow you to describe what the electrons are doing.</p>
<p>And all material sort of science</p>
<p>and material properties are governed by the electrons</p>
<p>and how they interact.</p>
<p>So, have a good summarization of the simulation</p>
<p>through the functional,</p>
<p>but one that is still close</p>
<p>to what the actual simulation would come out with.</p>
<p>So, how difficult is that task?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s involved in that task?</p>
<p>Is it running those complicated simulations</p>
<p>and learning the task of mapping</p>
<p>from the initial conditions</p>
<p>and the parameters of the simulation,</p>
<p>learning what the functional would be?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s pretty tricky.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve done it with,</p>
<p>the nice thing is we can run a lot of the simulations,</p>
<p>the molecular dynamic simulations on our compute clusters.</p>
<p>And so, that generates a lot of data.</p>
<p>So, in this case, the data is generated.</p>
<p>So, we like those sort of systems and that&rsquo;s why we use games.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simulated, generated data.</p>
<p>And we can kind of create as much of it as we want, really.</p>
<p>And just let&rsquo;s leave some,</p>
<p>if any computers are free in the cloud,</p>
<p>we just run, we run some of these calculations, right?</p>
<p>Compute cluster calculation.</p>
<p>I like how the free compute time</p>
<p>is used up on quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Yeah, quantum mechanics, exactly.</p>
<p>Simulations and protein simulations and other things.</p>
<p>And so, when you&rsquo;re not searching on YouTube</p>
<p>for free video, cat videos,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re using those computers usefully in quantum chemistry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the idea.</p>
<p>Finally.</p>
<p>And putting them to good use.</p>
<p>And then, yeah, and then all of that computational data</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s generated,</p>
<p>we can then try and learn the functionals from that,</p>
<p>which of course are way more efficient</p>
<p>once we learn the functional</p>
<p>than running those simulations would be.</p>
<p>Do you think one day AI may allow us</p>
<p>to do something like basically crack open physics?</p>
<p>So, do something like travel faster than the speed of light?</p>
<p>My ultimate aim is always being with AI</p>
<p>is the reason I am personally working on AI</p>
<p>for my whole life, it was to build a tool</p>
<p>to help us understand the universe.</p>
<p>So, I wanted to, and that means physics, really,</p>
<p>and the nature of reality.</p>
<p>So, I don&rsquo;t think we have systems</p>
<p>that are capable of doing that yet,</p>
<p>but when we get towards AGI,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s one of the first things</p>
<p>I think we should apply AGI to.</p>
<p>I would like to test the limits of physics</p>
<p>and our knowledge of physics.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many things we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>This is one thing I find fascinating about science.</p>
<p>And as a huge proponent of the scientific method</p>
<p>as being one of the greatest ideas humanity has ever had</p>
<p>and allowed us to progress with our knowledge,</p>
<p>but I think as a true scientist,</p>
<p>I think what you find is the more you find out,</p>
<p>the more you realize we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And I always think that it&rsquo;s surprising</p>
<p>that more people aren&rsquo;t troubled.</p>
<p>Every night I think about all these things</p>
<p>we interact with all the time,</p>
<p>that we have no idea how they work.</p>
<p>Time, consciousness, gravity, life, we can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I mean, these are all the fundamental things of nature.</p>
<p>I think the way we don&rsquo;t really know what they are.</p>
<p>To live life, we pin certain assumptions on them</p>
<p>and kind of treat our assumptions as if they&rsquo;re a fact.</p>
<p>That allows us to sort of box them off somehow.</p>
<p>Yeah, box them off somehow.</p>
<p>But the reality is when you think of time,</p>
<p>you should remind yourself,</p>
<p>you should take it off the shelf</p>
<p>and realize like, no, we have a bunch of assumptions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a lot of, there&rsquo;s even now a lot of debate.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of uncertainty about exactly what is time.</p>
<p>Is there an error of time?</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a lot of fundamental questions</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t just make assumptions about.</p>
<p>And maybe AI allows you to not put anything on the shelf.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Not make any hard assumptions</p>
<p>and really open it up and see what&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Exactly, I think we should be truly open minded about that.</p>
<p>And exactly that, not be dogmatic to a particular theory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll also allow us to build better tools,</p>
<p>experimental tools eventually,</p>
<p>that can then test certain theories</p>
<p>that may not be testable today.</p>
<p>Things about like what we spoke about at the beginning</p>
<p>about the computational nature of the universe.</p>
<p>How one might, if that was true,</p>
<p>how one might go about testing that, right?</p>
<p>And how much, you know, there are people</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve conjectured people like Scott Aaronson and others</p>
<p>about, you know, how much information</p>
<p>can a specific plank unit of space and time</p>
<p>contain, right?</p>
<p>So one might be able to think about testing those ideas</p>
<p>if you had AI helping you build</p>
<p>some new exquisite experimental tools.</p>
<p>This is what I imagine that, you know,</p>
<p>many decades from now we&rsquo;ll be able to do.</p>
<p>And what kind of questions can be answered</p>
<p>through running a simulation of them?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a bunch of physics simulations</p>
<p>you can imagine that could be run</p>
<p>in some kind of efficient way,</p>
<p>much like you&rsquo;re doing in the quantum simulation work.</p>
<p>And perhaps even the origin of life.</p>
<p>So figuring out how going even back</p>
<p>before the work of AlphaFold begins</p>
<p>of how this whole thing emerges from a rock.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>From a static thing.</p>
<p>What do you think AI will allow us to,</p>
<p>is that something you have your eye on?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trying to understand the origin of life.</p>
<p>First of all, yourself, what do you think,</p>
<p>how the heck did life originate on Earth?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, maybe I&rsquo;ll come to that in a second,</p>
<p>but I think the ultimate use of AI</p>
<p>is to kind of use it to accelerate science to the maximum.</p>
<p>So I think of it a little bit</p>
<p>like the tree of all knowledge.</p>
<p>If you imagine that&rsquo;s all the knowledge there is</p>
<p>in the universe to attain.</p>
<p>And we sort of barely scratched the surface of that so far.</p>
<p>And even though we&rsquo;ve done pretty well</p>
<p>since the enlightenment, right, as humanity.</p>
<p>And I think AI will turbocharge all of that,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;ve seen with AlphaFold.</p>
<p>And I want to explore as much of that tree of knowledge</p>
<p>as is possible to do.</p>
<p>And I think that involves AI helping us</p>
<p>with understanding or finding patterns,</p>
<p>but also potentially designing and building new tools,</p>
<p>experimental tools.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s all,</p>
<p>and also running simulations and learning simulations,</p>
<p>all of that we&rsquo;re sort of doing at a baby steps level here.</p>
<p>But I can imagine that in the decades to come</p>
<p>as what&rsquo;s the full flourishing of that line of thinking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be truly incredible, I would say.</p>
<p>If I visualized this tree of knowledge,</p>
<p>something tells me that that tree of knowledge for humans</p>
<p>is much smaller in the set of all possible trees</p>
<p>of knowledge, it&rsquo;s actually quite small</p>
<p>given our cognitive limitations,</p>
<p>limited cognitive capabilities,</p>
<p>that even with the tools we build,</p>
<p>we still won&rsquo;t be able to understand a lot of things.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s perhaps what nonhuman systems</p>
<p>might be able to reach farther, not just as tools,</p>
<p>but in themselves understanding something</p>
<p>that they can bring back.</p>
<p>Yeah, it could well be.</p>
<p>So, I mean, there&rsquo;s so many things</p>
<p>that are sort of encapsulated in what you just said there.</p>
<p>I think first of all, there&rsquo;s two different things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like, what do we understand today?</p>
<p>What could the human mind understand?</p>
<p>And what is the totality of what is there to be understood?</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s three concentric,</p>
<p>you can think of them as three larger and larger trees</p>
<p>or exploring more branches of that tree.</p>
<p>And I think with AI, we&rsquo;re gonna explore that whole lot.</p>
<p>Now, the question is, if you think about</p>
<p>what is the totality of what could be understood,</p>
<p>there may be some fundamental physics reasons</p>
<p>why certain things can&rsquo;t be understood,</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s outside a simulation or outside the universe.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s not understandable from within the universe.</p>
<p>So there may be some hard constraints like that.</p>
<p>It could be smaller constraints,</p>
<p>like we think of space time as fundamental.</p>
<p>Our human brains are really used to this idea</p>
<p>of a three dimensional world with time, maybe.</p>
<p>But our tools could go beyond that.</p>
<p>They wouldn&rsquo;t have that limitation necessarily.</p>
<p>They could think in 11 dimensions, 12 dimensions,</p>
<p>whatever is needed.</p>
<p>But we could still maybe understand that</p>
<p>in several different ways.</p>
<p>The example I always give is,</p>
<p>when I play Garry Kasparov for speed chess,</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;ve talked about chess and these kinds of things,</p>
<p>you know, if you&rsquo;re reasonably good at chess,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t come up with the move Garry comes up with</p>
<p>in his move, but he can explain it to you.</p>
<p>And you can understand.</p>
<p>And you can understand post hoc the reasoning.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s an even further level of like,</p>
<p>well, maybe you couldn&rsquo;t have invented that thing,</p>
<p>but going back to using language again,</p>
<p>perhaps you can understand and appreciate that.</p>
<p>Same way that you can appreciate, you know,</p>
<p>Vivaldi or Mozart or something without,</p>
<p>you can appreciate the beauty of that</p>
<p>without being able to construct it yourself, right?</p>
<p>Invent the music yourself.</p>
<p>So I think we see this in all forms of life.</p>
<p>So it will be that times, you know, a million,</p>
<p>but you can imagine also one sign of intelligence</p>
<p>is the ability to explain things clearly and simply, right?</p>
<p>You know, people like Richard Feynman,</p>
<p>another one of my old time heroes used to say that, right?</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t, you know, if you can explain it</p>
<p>something simply, then that&rsquo;s the best sign,</p>
<p>a complex topic simply,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s one of the best signs of you understanding it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I can see myself talking trash in the AI system in that way.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It gets frustrated how dumb I am</p>
<p>and trying to explain something to me.</p>
<p>I was like, well, that means you&rsquo;re not intelligent</p>
<p>because if you were intelligent,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be able to explain it simply.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course, you know, there&rsquo;s also the other option.</p>
<p>Of course, we could enhance ourselves and with our devices,</p>
<p>we are already sort of symbiotic with our compute devices,</p>
<p>right, with our phones and other things.</p>
<p>And, you know, there&rsquo;s stuff like Neuralink and Xceptra</p>
<p>that could advance that further.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s lots of really amazing possibilities</p>
<p>that I could foresee from here.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you some wild questions.</p>
<p>So out there looking for friends,</p>
<p>do you think there&rsquo;s a lot of alien civilizations out there?</p>
<p>So I guess this also goes back</p>
<p>to your origin of life question too,</p>
<p>because I think that that&rsquo;s key.</p>
<p>My personal opinion, looking at all this,</p>
<p>and, you know, it&rsquo;s one of my hobbies, physics, I guess.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s something I think about a lot</p>
<p>and talk to a lot of experts on and read a lot of books on.</p>
<p>And I think my feeling currently is that we are alone.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the most likely scenario</p>
<p>given what evidence we have.</p>
<p>So, and the reasoning is I think that, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve tried since things like SETI program</p>
<p>and I guess since the dawning of the space age,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve, you know, had telescopes,</p>
<p>open radio telescopes and other things.</p>
<p>And if you think about and try to detect signals,</p>
<p>now, if you think about the evolution of humans on earth,</p>
<p>we could have easily been a million years ahead</p>
<p>of our time now or million years behind,</p>
<p>right, easily with just some slightly different quirk</p>
<p>thing happening hundreds of thousands of years ago.</p>
<p>You know, things could have been slightly different</p>
<p>if the meteor would hit the dinosaurs a million years earlier,</p>
<p>maybe things would have evolved.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d be a million years ahead of where we are now.</p>
<p>So what that means is if you imagine where humanity will be</p>
<p>in a few hundred years, let alone a million years,</p>
<p>especially if we hopefully, you know,</p>
<p>solve things like climate change and other things,</p>
<p>and we continue to flourish and we build things like AI</p>
<p>and we do space traveling and all of the stuff</p>
<p>that humans have dreamed of forever, right?</p>
<p>And sci fi is talked about forever.</p>
<p>We will be spreading across the stars, right?</p>
<p>And von Neumann famously calculated, you know,</p>
<p>it would only take about a million years</p>
<p>if you sent out von Neumann probes to the nearest,</p>
<p>you know, the nearest other solar systems.</p>
<p>And then all they did was build two more versions</p>
<p>of themselves and sent those two out</p>
<p>to the next nearest systems.</p>
<p>You know, within a million years,</p>
<p>I think you would have one of these probes</p>
<p>in every system in the galaxy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not actually in cosmological time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually a very short amount of time.</p>
<p>So, and you know, people like Dyson have thought</p>
<p>about constructing Dyson spheres around stars</p>
<p>to collect all the energy coming out of the star.</p>
<p>You know, there would be constructions like that</p>
<p>would be visible across space,</p>
<p>probably even across a galaxy.</p>
<p>So, and then, you know, if you think about</p>
<p>all of our radio, television emissions</p>
<p>that have gone out since the, you know, 30s and 40s,</p>
<p>imagine a million years of that.</p>
<p>And now hundreds of civilizations doing that.</p>
<p>When we opened our ears at the point</p>
<p>we got technologically sophisticated enough</p>
<p>in the space age,</p>
<p>we should have heard a cacophony of voices.</p>
<p>We should have joined that cacophony of voices.</p>
<p>And what we did, we opened our ears and we heard nothing.</p>
<p>And many people who argue that there are aliens</p>
<p>would say, well, we haven&rsquo;t really done</p>
<p>exhaustive search yet.</p>
<p>And maybe we&rsquo;re looking in the wrong bands</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve got the wrong devices</p>
<p>and we wouldn&rsquo;t notice what an alien form was like</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;d be so different to what we&rsquo;re used to.</p>
<p>But, you know, I don&rsquo;t really buy that,</p>
<p>that it shouldn&rsquo;t be as difficult as that.</p>
<p>Like, I think we&rsquo;ve searched enough.</p>
<p>There should be everywhere.</p>
<p>If it was, yeah, it should be everywhere.</p>
<p>We should see Dyson spheres being put up,</p>
<p>sun&rsquo;s blinking in and out.</p>
<p>You know, there should be a lot of evidence</p>
<p>for those things.</p>
<p>And then there are other people who argue,</p>
<p>well, the sort of safari view of like,</p>
<p>well, we&rsquo;re a primitive species still</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re not space faring yet.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re, you know, there&rsquo;s some kind of global,</p>
<p>like universal rule not to interfere,</p>
<p>you know, Star Trek rule.</p>
<p>But like, look, we can&rsquo;t even coordinate humans</p>
<p>to deal with climate change and we&rsquo;re one species.</p>
<p>What is the chance that of all of these different</p>
<p>human civilization, you know, alien civilizations,</p>
<p>they would have the same priorities</p>
<p>and agree across these kinds of matters.</p>
<p>And even if that was true</p>
<p>and we were in some sort of safari for our own good,</p>
<p>to me, that&rsquo;s not much different</p>
<p>from the simulation hypothesis</p>
<p>because what does it mean, the simulation hypothesis?</p>
<p>I think in its most fundamental level,</p>
<p>it means what we&rsquo;re seeing is not quite reality, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something, there&rsquo;s something more deeper underlying it,</p>
<p>maybe computational.</p>
<p>Now, if we were in a sort of safari park</p>
<p>and everything we were seeing was a hologram</p>
<p>and it was projected by the aliens or whatever,</p>
<p>that to me is not much different</p>
<p>than thinking we&rsquo;re inside of another universe</p>
<p>because we still can&rsquo;t see true reality, right?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s other explanations.</p>
<p>It could be that the way they&rsquo;re communicating</p>
<p>is just fundamentally different,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re too dumb to understand the much better methods</p>
<p>of communication they have.</p>
<p>It could be, I mean, it&rsquo;s silly to say,</p>
<p>but our own thoughts could be the methods</p>
<p>by which they&rsquo;re communicating.</p>
<p>Like the place from which our ideas,</p>
<p>writers talk about this, like the muse.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it sounds like very kind of wild,</p>
<p>but it could be thoughts.</p>
<p>It could be some interactions with our mind</p>
<p>that we think are originating from us</p>
<p>is actually something that is coming</p>
<p>from other life forms elsewhere.</p>
<p>Consciousness itself might be that.</p>
<p>It could be, but I don&rsquo;t see any sensible argument</p>
<p>to the why would all of the alien species</p>
<p>behave in this way?</p>
<p>Yeah, some of them will be more primitive.</p>
<p>They will be close to our level.</p>
<p>There should be a whole sort of normal distribution</p>
<p>of these things, right?</p>
<p>Some would be aggressive.</p>
<p>Some would be curious.</p>
<p>Others would be very historical and philosophical</p>
<p>because maybe they&rsquo;re a million years older than us,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not, it shouldn&rsquo;t be like,</p>
<p>I mean, one alien civilization might be like that,</p>
<p>communicating thoughts and others,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t see why potentially the hundreds there should be</p>
<p>would be uniform in this way, right?</p>
<p>It could be a violent dictatorship that the people,</p>
<p>the alien civilizations that become successful</p>
<p>gain the ability to be destructive,</p>
<p>an order of magnitude more destructive,</p>
<p>but of course the sad thought,</p>
<p>well, either humans are very special.</p>
<p>We took a lot of leaps that arrived</p>
<p>at what it means to be human.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a question there, which was the hardest,</p>
<p>which was the most special,</p>
<p>but also if others have reached this level</p>
<p>and maybe many others have reached this level,</p>
<p>the great filter that prevented them from going farther</p>
<p>to becoming a multi planetary species</p>
<p>or reaching out into the stars.</p>
<p>And those are really important questions for us,</p>
<p>whether there&rsquo;s other alien civilizations out there or not,</p>
<p>this is very useful for us to think about.</p>
<p>If we destroy ourselves, how will we do it?</p>
<p>And how easy is it to do?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, these are big questions</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve thought about these a lot,</p>
<p>but the interesting thing is that if we&rsquo;re alone,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s somewhat comforting from the great filter perspective</p>
<p>because it probably means the great filters were passed us.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m pretty sure they are.</p>
<p>So going back to your origin of life question,</p>
<p>there are some incredible things</p>
<p>that no one knows how happened,</p>
<p>like obviously the first life form from chemical soup,</p>
<p>that seems pretty hard,</p>
<p>but I would guess the multicellular,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be that surprised if we saw single cell</p>
<p>sort of life forms elsewhere, bacteria type things,</p>
<p>but multicellular life seems incredibly hard,</p>
<p>that step of capturing mitochondria</p>
<p>and then sort of using that as part of yourself,</p>
<p>you know, when you&rsquo;ve just eaten it.</p>
<p>Would you say that&rsquo;s the biggest, the most,</p>
<p>like if you had to choose one sort of,</p>
<p>Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Galaxy, one sentence summary of like,</p>
<p>oh, those clever creatures did this,</p>
<p>that would be the multicellular.</p>
<p>I think that was probably the one that&rsquo;s the biggest.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a great book</p>
<p>called The 10 Great Inventions of Evolution by Nick Lane,</p>
<p>and he speculates on 10 of these, you know,</p>
<p>what could be great filters.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>I think the advent of intelligence</p>
<p>and conscious intelligence and in order, you know,</p>
<p>to us to be able to do science and things like that</p>
<p>is huge as well.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s only evolved once as far as, you know,</p>
<p>in Earth history.</p>
<p>So that would be a later candidate,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s certainly for the early candidates,</p>
<p>I think multicellular life forms is huge.</p>
<p>By the way, what it&rsquo;s interesting to ask you,</p>
<p>if you can hypothesize about</p>
<p>what is the origin of intelligence?</p>
<p>Is it that we started cooking meat over fire?</p>
<p>Is it that we somehow figured out</p>
<p>that we could be very powerful when we started collaborating?</p>
<p>So cooperation between our ancestors</p>
<p>so that we can overthrow the alpha male.</p>
<p>What is it, Richard?</p>
<p>I talked to Richard Ranham,</p>
<p>who thinks we&rsquo;re all just beta males</p>
<p>who figured out how to collaborate to defeat the one,</p>
<p>the dictator, the authoritarian alpha male</p>
<p>that controlled the tribe.</p>
<p>Is there other explanation?</p>
<p>Was there 2001 Space Odyssey type of monolith</p>
<p>that came down to Earth?</p>
<p>Well, I think all of those things</p>
<p>you suggested are good candidates,</p>
<p>fire and cooking, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s clearly important for energy efficiency,</p>
<p>cooking our meat and then being able to be more efficient</p>
<p>about eating it and consuming the energy.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s huge and then utilizing fire and tools</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right about the tribal cooperation aspects</p>
<p>and probably language is part of that</p>
<p>because probably that&rsquo;s what allowed us</p>
<p>to outcompete Neanderthals</p>
<p>and perhaps less cooperative species.</p>
<p>So that may be the case.</p>
<p>Tool making, spears, axes, I think that let us,</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s pretty clear now</p>
<p>that humans were responsible</p>
<p>for a lot of the extinctions of megafauna,</p>
<p>especially in the Americas when humans arrived.</p>
<p>So you can imagine once you discover tool usage</p>
<p>how powerful that would have been</p>
<p>and how scary for animals.</p>
<p>So I think all of those could have been explanations for it.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that it&rsquo;s a bit</p>
<p>like general intelligence too,</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s very costly to begin with to have a brain</p>
<p>and especially a general purpose brain</p>
<p>rather than a special purpose one</p>
<p>because the amount of energy our brains use,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like 20% of the body&rsquo;s energy</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s massive and even your thinking chest,</p>
<p>one of the funny things that we used to say</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s as much as a racing driver uses</p>
<p>for a whole Formula One race,</p>
<p>just playing a game of serious high level chess,</p>
<p>which you wouldn&rsquo;t think just sitting there</p>
<p>because the brain&rsquo;s using so much energy.</p>
<p>So in order for an animal, an organism to justify that,</p>
<p>there has to be a huge payoff.</p>
<p>And the problem with half a brain</p>
<p>or half intelligence, say an IQs of like a monkey brain,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not clear you can justify that evolutionary</p>
<p>until you get to the human level brain.</p>
<p>And so, but how do you do that jump?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult,</p>
<p>which is why I think it has only been done once</p>
<p>from the sort of specialized brains that you see in animals</p>
<p>to this sort of general purpose,</p>
<p>chewing powerful brains that humans have</p>
<p>and which allows us to invent the modern world.</p>
<p>And it takes a lot to cross that barrier.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;ve seen the same with AI systems,</p>
<p>which is that maybe until very recently,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always been easier to craft a specific solution</p>
<p>to a problem like chess than it has been</p>
<p>to build a general learning system</p>
<p>that could potentially do many things.</p>
<p>Cause initially that system will be way worse</p>
<p>than less efficient than the specialized system.</p>
<p>So one of the interesting quirks of the human mind</p>
<p>of this evolved system is that it appears to be conscious.</p>
<p>This thing that we don&rsquo;t quite understand,</p>
<p>but it seems very special is ability</p>
<p>to have a subjective experience</p>
<p>that it feels like something to eat a cookie,</p>
<p>the deliciousness of it or see a color</p>
<p>and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Do you think in order to solve intelligence,</p>
<p>we also need to solve consciousness along the way?</p>
<p>Do you think AGI systems need to have consciousness</p>
<p>in order to be truly intelligent?</p>
<p>Yeah, we thought about this a lot actually.</p>
<p>And I think that my guess is that consciousness</p>
<p>and intelligence are double dissociable.</p>
<p>So you can have one without the other both ways.</p>
<p>And I think you can see that with consciousness</p>
<p>in that I think some animals and pets,</p>
<p>if you have a pet dog or something like that,</p>
<p>you can see some of the higher animals and dolphins,</p>
<p>things like that have self awareness</p>
<p>and are very sociable, seem to dream.</p>
<p>A lot of the traits one would regard</p>
<p>as being kind of conscious and self aware,</p>
<p>but yet they&rsquo;re not that smart, right?</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not that intelligent</p>
<p>by say IQ standards or something like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s also possible that our understanding</p>
<p>of intelligence is flawed, like putting an IQ to it.</p>
<p>Maybe the thing that a dog can do</p>
<p>is actually gone very far along the path of intelligence</p>
<p>and we humans are just able to play chess</p>
<p>and maybe write poems.</p>
<p>Right, but if we go back to the idea of AGI</p>
<p>and general intelligence, dogs are very specialized, right?</p>
<p>Most animals are pretty specialized.</p>
<p>They can be amazing at what they do,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re like kind of elite sports people or something,</p>
<p>right, so they do one thing extremely well</p>
<p>because their entire brain is optimized.</p>
<p>They have somehow convinced the entirety</p>
<p>of the human population to feed them and service them.</p>
<p>So in some way they&rsquo;re controlling.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Well, we co evolved to some crazy degree, right?</p>
<p>Including the way the dogs even wag their tails</p>
<p>and twitch their noses, right?</p>
<p>We find inextricably cute.</p>
<p>But I think you can also see intelligence on the other side.</p>
<p>So systems like artificial systems</p>
<p>that are amazingly smart at certain things</p>
<p>like maybe playing go and chess and other things,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t feel at all in any shape or form conscious</p>
<p>in the way that you do to me or I do to you.</p>
<p>And I think actually building AI</p>
<p>is these intelligent constructs</p>
<p>is one of the best ways to explore</p>
<p>the mystery of consciousness, to break it down</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re gonna have devices</p>
<p>that are pretty smart at certain things</p>
<p>or capable at certain things,</p>
<p>but potentially won&rsquo;t have any semblance</p>
<p>of self awareness or other things.</p>
<p>And in fact, I would advocate if there&rsquo;s a choice,</p>
<p>building systems in the first place,</p>
<p>AI systems that are not conscious to begin with</p>
<p>are just tools until we understand them better</p>
<p>and the capabilities better.</p>
<p>So on that topic, just not as the CEO of DeepMind,</p>
<p>just as a human being, let me ask you</p>
<p>about this one particular anecdotal evidence</p>
<p>of the Google engineer who made a comment</p>
<p>or believed that there&rsquo;s some aspect of a language model,</p>
<p>the Lambda language model that exhibited sentience.</p>
<p>So you said you believe there might be a responsibility</p>
<p>to build systems that are not sentient.</p>
<p>And this experience of a particular engineer,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;d love to get your general opinion</p>
<p>on this kind of thing, but I think it will happen</p>
<p>more and more and more, which not when engineers,</p>
<p>but when people out there that don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>an engineering background start interacting</p>
<p>with increasingly intelligent systems,</p>
<p>we anthropomorphize them.</p>
<p>They start to have deep, impactful interactions with us</p>
<p>in a way that we miss them when they&rsquo;re gone.</p>
<p>And we sure as heck feel like they&rsquo;re living entities,</p>
<p>self aware entities, and maybe even</p>
<p>we project sentience onto them.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your thought about this particular system?</p>
<p>Have you ever met a language model that&rsquo;s sentient?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>What do you make of the case of when you kind of feel</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s some elements of sentience to the system?</p>
<p>Yeah, so this is an interesting question</p>
<p>and obviously a very fundamental one.</p>
<p>So the first thing to say is I think that none</p>
<p>of the systems we have today, I would say,</p>
<p>even have one iota of semblance</p>
<p>of consciousness or sentience.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my personal feeling interacting with them every day.</p>
<p>So I think this way premature to be discussing</p>
<p>what that engineer talked about.</p>
<p>I think at the moment it&rsquo;s more of a projection</p>
<p>of the way our own minds work,</p>
<p>which is to see sort of purpose and direction</p>
<p>in almost anything that we, you know,</p>
<p>our brains are trained to interpret agency,</p>
<p>basically in things, even inanimate things sometimes.</p>
<p>And of course with a language system,</p>
<p>because language is so fundamental to intelligence,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be easy for us to anthropomorphize that.</p>
<p>I mean, back in the day, even the first, you know,</p>
<p>the dumbest sort of template chatbots ever,</p>
<p>Eliza and the ilk of the original chatbots</p>
<p>back in the sixties fooled some people</p>
<p>under certain circumstances, right?</p>
<p>It pretended to be a psychologist.</p>
<p>So just basically rabbit back to you</p>
<p>the same question you asked it back to you.</p>
<p>And some people believe that.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think we can, this is why I think</p>
<p>the Turing test is a little bit flawed as a formal test</p>
<p>because it depends on the sophistication of the judge,</p>
<p>whether or not they are qualified to make that distinction.</p>
<p>So I think we should talk to, you know,</p>
<p>the top philosophers about this,</p>
<p>people like Daniel Dennett and David Chalmers and others</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve obviously thought deeply about consciousness.</p>
<p>Of course, consciousness itself hasn&rsquo;t been well,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no agreed definition.</p>
<p>If I was to, you know, speculate about that, you know,</p>
<p>I kind of, the working definition I like is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the way information feels when it gets processed.</p>
<p>I think maybe Max Tegmark came up with that.</p>
<p>I like that idea.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it helps us get towards</p>
<p>any more operational thing,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s a nice way of viewing it.</p>
<p>I think we can obviously see from neuroscience</p>
<p>certain prerequisites that are required,</p>
<p>like self awareness, I think is necessary,</p>
<p>but not sufficient component.</p>
<p>This idea of a self and other</p>
<p>and set of coherent preferences</p>
<p>that are coherent over time.</p>
<p>You know, these things are maybe memory.</p>
<p>These things are probably needed</p>
<p>for a sentient or conscious being.</p>
<p>But the reason, the difficult thing,</p>
<p>I think for us when we get,</p>
<p>and I think this is a really interesting</p>
<p>philosophical debate is when we get closer to AGI</p>
<p>and, you know, and much more powerful systems</p>
<p>than we have today,</p>
<p>how are we going to make this judgment?</p>
<p>And one way, which is the Turing test</p>
<p>is sort of a behavioral judgment,</p>
<p>is the system exhibiting all the behaviors</p>
<p>that a human sentient or a sentient being would exhibit?</p>
<p>Is it answering the right questions?</p>
<p>Is it saying the right things?</p>
<p>Is it indistinguishable from a human?</p>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s a second thing</p>
<p>that makes us as humans regard each other as sentient,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Why do we think this?</p>
<p>And I debated this with Daniel Dennett.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a second reason</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s often overlooked,</p>
<p>which is that we&rsquo;re running on the same substrate, right?</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re exhibiting the same behavior,</p>
<p>more or less as humans,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re running on the same, you know,</p>
<p>carbon based biological substrate,</p>
<p>the squishy, you know, few pounds of flesh in our skulls,</p>
<p>then the most parsimonious, I think, explanation</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re feeling the same thing as I&rsquo;m feeling, right?</p>
<p>But we will never have that second part,</p>
<p>the substrate equivalence with a machine, right?</p>
<p>So we will have to only judge based on the behavior.</p>
<p>And I think the substrate equivalence</p>
<p>is a critical part of why we make assumptions</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re conscious.</p>
<p>And in fact, even with animals, high level animals,</p>
<p>why we think they might be,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re exhibiting some of the behaviors</p>
<p>we would expect from a sentient animal.</p>
<p>And we know they&rsquo;re made of the same things,</p>
<p>biological neurons.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna have to come up with explanations</p>
<p>or models of the gap between substrate differences,</p>
<p>between machines and humans</p>
<p>to get anywhere beyond the behavioral.</p>
<p>But to me, sort of the practical question</p>
<p>is very interesting and very important.</p>
<p>When you have millions, perhaps billions of people</p>
<p>believing that you have a sentient AI,</p>
<p>believing what that Google engineer believed,</p>
<p>which I just see as an obvious, very near term future thing,</p>
<p>certainly on the path to AGI,</p>
<p>how does that change the world?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the responsibility of the AI system</p>
<p>to help those millions of people?</p>
<p>And also what&rsquo;s the ethical thing?</p>
<p>Because you can make a lot of people happy</p>
<p>by creating a meaningful, deep experience</p>
<p>with a system that&rsquo;s faking it before it makes it.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t, are we the right,</p>
<p>who is to say what&rsquo;s the right thing to do?</p>
<p>Should AI always be tools?</p>
<p>Why are we constraining AI to always be tools</p>
<p>as opposed to friends?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think, well, I mean, these are fantastic questions</p>
<p>and also critical ones.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve been thinking about this</p>
<p>since the start of DeepMind and before that,</p>
<p>because we plan for success</p>
<p>and however remote that looked like back in 2010.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve always had sort of these ethical considerations</p>
<p>as fundamental at DeepMind.</p>
<p>And my current thinking on the language models</p>
<p>and large models is they&rsquo;re not ready,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t understand them well enough yet.</p>
<p>And in terms of analysis tools and guard rails,</p>
<p>what they can and can&rsquo;t do and so on,</p>
<p>to deploy them at scale, because I think,</p>
<p>there are big, still ethical questions</p>
<p>like should an AI system always announce</p>
<p>that it is an AI system to begin with?</p>
<p>Probably yes.</p>
<p>What do you do about answering those philosophical questions</p>
<p>about the feelings people may have about AI systems,</p>
<p>perhaps incorrectly attributed?</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of research</p>
<p>that needs to be done first to responsibly,</p>
<p>before you can responsibly deploy these systems at scale.</p>
<p>That will be at least be my current position.</p>
<p>Over time, I&rsquo;m very confident we&rsquo;ll have those tools</p>
<p>like interpretability questions and analysis questions.</p>
<p>And then with the ethical quandary,</p>
<p>I think there it&rsquo;s important to look beyond just science.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I think philosophy, social sciences,</p>
<p>even theology, other things like that come into it,</p>
<p>where arts and humanities,</p>
<p>what does it mean to be human and the spirit of being human</p>
<p>and to enhance that and the human condition, right?</p>
<p>And allow us to experience things</p>
<p>we could never experience before</p>
<p>and improve the overall human condition</p>
<p>and humanity overall, get radical abundance,</p>
<p>solve many scientific problems, solve disease.</p>
<p>So this is the era I think, this is the amazing era</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re heading into if we do it right.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve got to be careful.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already seen with things like social media,</p>
<p>how dual use technologies can be misused by,</p>
<p>firstly, by bad actors or naive actors or crazy actors,</p>
<p>right, so there&rsquo;s that set of just the common</p>
<p>or garden misuse of existing dual use technology.</p>
<p>And then of course, there&rsquo;s an additional thing</p>
<p>that has to be overcome with AI</p>
<p>that eventually it may have its own agency.</p>
<p>So it could be good or bad in and of itself.</p>
<p>So I think these questions have to be approached</p>
<p>very carefully using the scientific method, I would say,</p>
<p>in terms of hypothesis generation, careful control testing,</p>
<p>not live A, B testing out in the world,</p>
<p>because with powerful technologies like AI,</p>
<p>if something goes wrong, it may cause a lot of harm</p>
<p>before you can fix it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like an imaging app or game app</p>
<p>where if something goes wrong, it&rsquo;s relatively easy to fix</p>
<p>and the harm is relatively small.</p>
<p>So I think it comes with the usual cliche of,</p>
<p>like with a lot of power comes a lot of responsibility.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the case here with things like AI,</p>
<p>given the enormous opportunity in front of us.</p>
<p>And I think we need a lot of voices</p>
<p>and as many inputs into things like the design</p>
<p>of the systems and the values they should have</p>
<p>and what goals should they be put to.</p>
<p>I think as wide a group of voices as possible</p>
<p>beyond just the technologists is needed to input into that</p>
<p>and to have a say in that,</p>
<p>especially when it comes to deployment of these systems,</p>
<p>which is when the rubber really hits the road,</p>
<p>it really affects the general person in the street</p>
<p>rather than fundamental research.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I say, I think as a first step,</p>
<p>it would be better if we have the choice</p>
<p>to build these systems as tools to give,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not saying that they should never go beyond tools</p>
<p>because of course the potential is there</p>
<p>for it to go way beyond just tools.</p>
<p>But I think that would be a good first step</p>
<p>in order for us to allow us to carefully experiment</p>
<p>and understand what these things can do.</p>
<p>So the leap between tool, the sentient entity being</p>
<p>is one we should take very careful of.</p>
<p>Let me ask a dark personal question.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re one of the most brilliant people</p>
<p>in the AI community, you&rsquo;re also one of the most kind</p>
<p>and if I may say sort of loved people in the community.</p>
<p>That said, creation of a super intelligent AI system</p>
<p>would be one of the most powerful things in the world,</p>
<p>tools or otherwise.</p>
<p>And again, as the old saying goes, power corrupts</p>
<p>and absolute power corrupts absolutely.</p>
<p>You are likely to be one of the people,</p>
<p>I would say probably the most likely person</p>
<p>to be in the control of such a system.</p>
<p>Do you think about the corrupting nature of power</p>
<p>when you talk about these kinds of systems</p>
<p>that as all dictators and people have caused atrocities</p>
<p>in the past, always think they&rsquo;re doing good,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t do good because the power</p>
<p>has polluted their mind about what is good</p>
<p>and what is evil.</p>
<p>Do you think about this stuff</p>
<p>or are we just focused on language model?</p>
<p>No, I think about them all the time</p>
<p>and I think what are the defenses against that?</p>
<p>I think one thing is to remain very grounded</p>
<p>and sort of humble, no matter what you do or achieve.</p>
<p>And I try to do that, my best friends</p>
<p>are still my set of friends</p>
<p>from my undergraduate Cambridge days,</p>
<p>my family&rsquo;s and friends are very important.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always, I think trying to be a multidisciplinary person,</p>
<p>it helps to keep you humble</p>
<p>because no matter how good you are at one topic,</p>
<p>someone will be better than you at that.</p>
<p>And always relearning a new topic again from scratch</p>
<p>is a new field is very humbling, right?</p>
<p>So for me, that&rsquo;s been biology over the last five years,</p>
<p>huge area topic and I just love doing that,</p>
<p>but it helps to keep you grounded</p>
<p>like it keeps you open minded.</p>
<p>And then the other important thing</p>
<p>is to have a really good, amazing set of people around you</p>
<p>at your company or your organization</p>
<p>who are also very ethical and grounded themselves</p>
<p>and help to keep you that way.</p>
<p>And then ultimately just to answer your question,</p>
<p>I hope we&rsquo;re gonna be a big part of birthing AI</p>
<p>and that being the greatest benefit to humanity</p>
<p>of any tool or technology ever,</p>
<p>and getting us into a world of radical abundance</p>
<p>and curing diseases and solving many of the big challenges</p>
<p>we have in front of us.</p>
<p>And then ultimately help the ultimate flourishing</p>
<p>of humanity to travel the stars</p>
<p>and find those aliens if they are there.</p>
<p>And if they&rsquo;re not there, find out why they&rsquo;re not there,</p>
<p>what is going on here in the universe.</p>
<p>This is all to come.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve always dreamed about.</p>
<p>But I think AI is too big an idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to be,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be a certain set of pioneers who get there first.</p>
<p>I hope we&rsquo;re in the vanguard</p>
<p>so we can influence how that goes.</p>
<p>And I think it matters who builds,</p>
<p>which cultures they come from and what values they have,</p>
<p>the builders of AI systems.</p>
<p>Cause I think even though the AI system</p>
<p>is gonna learn for itself most of its knowledge,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be a residue in the system of the culture</p>
<p>and the values of the creators of that system.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s interesting questions</p>
<p>to discuss about that geopolitically.</p>
<p>Different cultures,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in a more fragmented world than ever, unfortunately.</p>
<p>I think in terms of global cooperation,</p>
<p>we see that in things like climate</p>
<p>where we can&rsquo;t seem to get our act together globally</p>
<p>to cooperate on these pressing matters.</p>
<p>I hope that will change over time.</p>
<p>Perhaps if we get to an era of radical abundance,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have to be so competitive anymore.</p>
<p>Maybe we can be more cooperative</p>
<p>if resources aren&rsquo;t so scarce.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that in terms of power corrupting</p>
<p>and leading to destructive things,</p>
<p>it seems that some of the atrocities of the past happen</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a significant constraint on resources.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the first thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<p>I think scarcity is one thing that&rsquo;s led to competition,</p>
<p>sort of zero sum game thinking.</p>
<p>I would like us to all be in a positive sum world.</p>
<p>And I think for that, you have to remove scarcity.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s enough, unfortunately,</p>
<p>to get world peace</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s also other corrupting things</p>
<p>like wanting power over people and this kind of stuff,</p>
<p>which is not necessarily satisfied by just abundance.</p>
<p>But I think it will help.</p>
<p>But I think ultimately, AI is not gonna be run</p>
<p>by any one person or one organization.</p>
<p>I think it should belong to the world, belong to humanity.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;ll be many ways this will happen.</p>
<p>And ultimately, everybody should have a say in that.</p>
<p>Do you have advice for young people in high school,</p>
<p>in college, maybe if they&rsquo;re interested in AI</p>
<p>or interested in having a big impact on the world,</p>
<p>what they should do to have a career they can be proud of</p>
<p>or to have a life they can be proud of?</p>
<p>I love giving talks to the next generation.</p>
<p>What I say to them is actually two things.</p>
<p>I think the most important things to learn about</p>
<p>and to find out about when you&rsquo;re young</p>
<p>is what are your true passions is first of all,</p>
<p>as two things.</p>
<p>One is find your true passions.</p>
<p>And I think you can do that by,</p>
<p>the way to do that is to explore as many things as possible</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re young and you have the time</p>
<p>and you can take those risks.</p>
<p>I would also encourage people to look at</p>
<p>finding the connections between things in a unique way.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a really great way to find a passion.</p>
<p>Second thing I would say, advise is know yourself.</p>
<p>So spend a lot of time understanding</p>
<p>how you work best.</p>
<p>Like what are the optimal times to work?</p>
<p>What are the optimal ways that you study?</p>
<p>What are your, how do you deal with pressure?</p>
<p>Sort of test yourself in various scenarios</p>
<p>and try and improve your weaknesses,</p>
<p>but also find out what your unique skills and strengths are</p>
<p>and then hone those.</p>
<p>So then that&rsquo;s what will be your super value</p>
<p>in the world later on.</p>
<p>And if you can then combine those two things</p>
<p>and find passions that you&rsquo;re genuinely excited about</p>
<p>that intersect with what your unique strong skills are,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re onto something incredible</p>
<p>and I think you can make a huge difference in the world.</p>
<p>So let me ask about know yourself.</p>
<p>This is fun.</p>
<p>Quick questions about day in the life, the perfect day,</p>
<p>the perfect productive day in the life of Demis&rsquo;s Hub.</p>
<p>Maybe these days you&rsquo;re, there&rsquo;s a lot involved.</p>
<p>So maybe a slightly younger Demis&rsquo;s Hub</p>
<p>where you could focus on a single project maybe.</p>
<p>How early do you wake up?</p>
<p>Are you a night owl?</p>
<p>Do you wake up early in the morning?</p>
<p>What are some interesting habits?</p>
<p>How many dozens of cups of coffees do you drink a day?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the computer that you use?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the setup?</p>
<p>How many screens?</p>
<p>What kind of keyboard?</p>
<p>Are we talking Emacs Vim</p>
<p>or are we talking something more modern?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a bunch of those questions.</p>
<p>So maybe day in the life, what&rsquo;s the perfect day involved?</p>
<p>Well, these days it&rsquo;s quite different</p>
<p>from say 10, 20 years ago.</p>
<p>Back 10, 20 years ago, it would have been</p>
<p>a whole day of research, individual research or programming,</p>
<p>doing some experiment, neuroscience,</p>
<p>computer science experiment,</p>
<p>reading lots of research papers.</p>
<p>And then perhaps at nighttime,</p>
<p>reading science fiction books or playing some games.</p>
<p>But lots of focus, so like deep focused work</p>
<p>on whether it&rsquo;s programming or reading research papers.</p>
<p>Yes, so that would be lots of deep focus work.</p>
<p>These days for the last sort of, I guess, five to 10 years,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually got quite a structure</p>
<p>that works very well for me now,</p>
<p>which is that I&rsquo;m a complete night owl, always have been.</p>
<p>So I optimize for that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll basically do a normal day&rsquo;s work,</p>
<p>get into work about 11 o clock</p>
<p>and sort of do work to about seven in the office.</p>
<p>And I will arrange back to back meetings</p>
<p>for the entire time of that.</p>
<p>And with as many, meet as many people as possible.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my collaboration management part of the day.</p>
<p>Then I go home, spend time with the family and friends,</p>
<p>have dinner, relax a little bit.</p>
<p>And then I start a second day of work.</p>
<p>I call it my second day of work around 10 p.m., 11 p.m.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the time to about the small hours of the morning,</p>
<p>four or five in the morning, where I will do my thinking</p>
<p>and reading and research, writing research papers.</p>
<p>Sadly, I don&rsquo;t have time to code anymore,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not efficient to do that these days,</p>
<p>given the amount of time I have.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s when I do, you know,</p>
<p>maybe do the long kind of stretches</p>
<p>of thinking and planning.</p>
<p>And then probably, you know, using email, other things,</p>
<p>I would set, I would fire off a lot of things to my team</p>
<p>to deal with the next morning.</p>
<p>But actually thinking about this overnight,</p>
<p>we should go for this project</p>
<p>or arrange this meeting the next day.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re thinking through a problem,</p>
<p>are you talking about a sheet of paper with a pen?</p>
<p>Is there some structured process?</p>
<p>I still like pencil and paper best for working out things,</p>
<p>but these days it&rsquo;s just so efficient</p>
<p>to read research papers just on the screen.</p>
<p>I still often print them out, actually.</p>
<p>I still prefer to mark out things.</p>
<p>And I find it goes into the brain better</p>
<p>and sticks in the brain better</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re still using physical pen and pencil and paper.</p>
<p>So you take notes with the&hellip;</p>
<p>I have lots of notes, electronic ones,</p>
<p>and also whole stacks of notebooks that I use at home, yeah.</p>
<p>On some of these most challenging next steps, for example,</p>
<p>stuff none of us know about that you&rsquo;re working on,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re thinking,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some deep thinking required there, right?</p>
<p>Like what is the right problem?</p>
<p>What is the right approach?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re gonna have to invest a huge amount of time</p>
<p>for the whole team.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to have to pursue this thing.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the right way to do it?</p>
<p>Is RL gonna work here or not?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the right thing to try?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the right benchmark to use?</p>
<p>Do we need to construct a benchmark from scratch?</p>
<p>All those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So I think of all those kinds of things</p>
<p>in the nighttime phase, but also much more,</p>
<p>I find I&rsquo;ve always found the quiet hours of the morning</p>
<p>when everyone&rsquo;s asleep, it&rsquo;s super quiet outside.</p>
<p>I love that time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the golden hours,</p>
<p>like between one and three in the morning.</p>
<p>Put some music on, some inspiring music on,</p>
<p>and then think these deep thoughts.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s when I would read my philosophy books</p>
<p>and Spinoza&rsquo;s, my recent favorite can, all these things.</p>
<p>And I read about a great scientist of history,</p>
<p>how they did things, how they thought things.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s when you do all your creative,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when I do all my creative thinking.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s good, I think people recommend</p>
<p>you do your sort of creative thinking in one block.</p>
<p>And the way I organize the day,</p>
<p>that way I don&rsquo;t get interrupted.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s obviously no one else is up at those times.</p>
<p>So I can go, I can sort of get super deep</p>
<p>and super into flow.</p>
<p>The other nice thing about doing it nighttime wise</p>
<p>is if I&rsquo;m really onto something</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ve got really deep into something,</p>
<p>I can choose to extend it</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll go into six in the morning, whatever.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll just pay for it the next day.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll be a bit tired and I won&rsquo;t be my best,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I can decide looking at my schedule the next day</p>
<p>and given where I&rsquo;m at with this particular thought</p>
<p>or creative idea that I&rsquo;m gonna pay that cost the next day.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s more flexible than morning people</p>
<p>who do that, they get up at four in the morning.</p>
<p>They can also do those golden hours then,</p>
<p>but then their start of their scheduled day</p>
<p>starts at breakfast, 8 a.m.,</p>
<p>whatever they have their first meeting.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s hard, you have to reschedule a day</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in flow.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t have to do that.</p>
<p>So that could be a true special thread of thoughts</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re too passionate about.</p>
<p>This is where some of the greatest ideas</p>
<p>could potentially come is when you just lose yourself</p>
<p>late into the night.</p>
<p>And for the meetings, I mean, you&rsquo;re loading in</p>
<p>really hard problems in a very short amount of time.</p>
<p>So you have to do some kind of first principles thinking</p>
<p>here, it&rsquo;s like, what&rsquo;s the problem?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the state of things?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the right next steps?</p>
<p>You have to get really good at context switching,</p>
<p>which is one of the hardest things,</p>
<p>because especially as we do so many things,</p>
<p>if you include all the scientific things we do,</p>
<p>scientific fields we&rsquo;re working in,</p>
<p>these are complex fields in themselves.</p>
<p>And you have to sort of keep abreast of that.</p>
<p>But I enjoy it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a sort of generalist in a way.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually what happened in my games career</p>
<p>after chess.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I stopped playing chess</p>
<p>was because I got into computers,</p>
<p>but also I started realizing there were many other</p>
<p>great games out there to play too.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve always been that way inclined, multidisciplinary.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s too many interesting things in the world</p>
<p>to spend all your time just on one thing.</p>
<p>So you mentioned Spinoza, gotta ask the big, ridiculously</p>
<p>big question about life.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?</p>
<p>Why are we humans here?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve already mentioned that perhaps the universe</p>
<p>created us.</p>
<p>Is that why you think we&rsquo;re here?</p>
<p>To understand how the universe works?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think my answer to that would be,</p>
<p>and at least the life I&rsquo;m living,</p>
<p>is to gain and understand the knowledge,</p>
<p>to gain knowledge and understand the universe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I think, I can&rsquo;t see any higher purpose</p>
<p>than that if you think back to the classical Greeks,</p>
<p>the virtue of gaining knowledge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I think it&rsquo;s one of the few true virtues</p>
<p>is to understand the world around us</p>
<p>and the context and humanity better.</p>
<p>And I think if you do that, you become more compassionate</p>
<p>and more understanding yourself and more tolerant</p>
<p>and all these, I think all these other things</p>
<p>may flow from that.</p>
<p>And to me, understanding the nature of reality,</p>
<p>that is the biggest question.</p>
<p>What is going on here is sometimes the colloquial way I say.</p>
<p>What is really going on here?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so mysterious.</p>
<p>I feel like we&rsquo;re in some huge puzzle.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, but the world is also seems to be,</p>
<p>the universe seems to be structured in a way.</p>
<p>You know, why is it structured in a way</p>
<p>that science is even possible?</p>
<p>That, you know, methods, the scientific method works,</p>
<p>things are repeatable.</p>
<p>It feels like it&rsquo;s almost structured in a way</p>
<p>to be conducive to gaining knowledge.</p>
<p>So I feel like, and you know,</p>
<p>why should computers be even possible?</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t that amazing that computational electronic devices</p>
<p>can be possible, and they&rsquo;re made of sand,</p>
<p>our most common element that we have,</p>
<p>you know, silicon on the Earth&rsquo;s crust.</p>
<p>It could have been made of diamond or something,</p>
<p>then we would have only had one computer.</p>
<p>So a lot of things are kind of slightly suspicious to me.</p>
<p>It sure as heck sounds, this puzzle sure as heck sounds</p>
<p>like something we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>what it takes to design a game that&rsquo;s really fun to play</p>
<p>for prolonged periods of time.</p>
<p>And it does seem like this puzzle, like you mentioned,</p>
<p>the more you learn about it,</p>
<p>the more you realize how little you know.</p>
<p>So it humbles you, but excites you</p>
<p>by the possibility of learning more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one heck of a puzzle we got going on here.</p>
<p>So like I mentioned, of all the people in the world,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re very likely to be the one who creates the AGI system</p>
<p>that achieves human level intelligence and goes beyond it.</p>
<p>So if you got a chance and very well,</p>
<p>you could be the person that goes into the room</p>
<p>with the system and have a conversation.</p>
<p>Maybe you only get to ask one question.</p>
<p>If you do, what question would you ask her?</p>
<p>I would probably ask, what is the true nature of reality?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the question.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d understand the answer</p>
<p>because maybe it would be 42 or something like that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the question I would ask.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;ll be a deep sigh from the systems,</p>
<p>like, all right, how do I explain to this human?</p>
<p>All right, let me, I don&rsquo;t have time to explain.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll draw you a picture that it is.</p>
<p>I mean, how do you even begin to answer that question?</p>
<p>Well, I think it would.</p>
<p>What would you think the answer could possibly look like?</p>
<p>I think it could start looking like</p>
<p>more fundamental explanations of physics</p>
<p>would be the beginning.</p>
<p>More careful specification of that,</p>
<p>taking you, walking us through by the hand</p>
<p>as to what one would do to maybe prove those things out.</p>
<p>Maybe giving you glimpses of what things</p>
<p>you totally miss in the physics of today.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>Just here&rsquo;s glimpses of, no, like there&rsquo;s a much,</p>
<p>a much more elaborate world</p>
<p>or a much simpler world or something.</p>
<p>A much deeper, maybe simpler explanation of things,</p>
<p>right, than the standard model of physics,</p>
<p>which we know doesn&rsquo;t work, but we still keep adding to.</p>
<p>So, and that&rsquo;s how I think the beginning</p>
<p>of an explanation would look.</p>
<p>And it would start encompassing many of the mysteries</p>
<p>that we have wondered about for thousands of years,</p>
<p>like consciousness, dreaming, life, and gravity,</p>
<p>all of these things.</p>
<p>Yeah, giving us glimpses of explanations for those things.</p>
<p>Well, Damasir, one of the special human beings</p>
<p>in this giant puzzle of ours,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a huge honor that you would take a pause</p>
<p>from the bigger puzzle to solve this small puzzle</p>
<p>of a conversation with me today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s truly an honor and a pleasure.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thank you, I really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Thanks, Lex.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Damas Ashabis.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Edgar Dykstra.</p>
<p>Computer science is no more about computers</p>
<p>than astronomy is about telescopes.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
