    <p>The following is a conversation with Yoram Brook and Yoram Hazoni.</p>
<p>This is Yoram&rsquo;s third time on this podcast and Yoram&rsquo;s first time.</p>
<p>Yoram Brook is an Objectivist Philosopher, Chairman of the Ayn Rand Institute, host of</p>
<p>the Yoram Brook Show, and the coauthor of Free Market Revolution and Equal is Unfair.</p>
<p>Yoram Hazoni is a National Conservatism thinker, Chairman of the Edmund Burke Foundation that</p>
<p>hosted the National Conservatism Conference.</p>
<p>He is also the host of the NatCon Talk and author of The Virtue of Nationalism and an</p>
<p>upcoming book called Conservatism, A Rediscovery.</p>
<p>Allow me to say a few words about each part of the two word title of this episode, Nationalism</p>
<p>Debate.</p>
<p>First Debate, I would like to have a few conversations this year that are a kind of debate with two</p>
<p>or three people that hold differing views on a particular topic but come to the table</p>
<p>with respect for each other and a desire to learn and discover something interesting together</p>
<p>through the empathetic exploration of the tension between their ideas.</p>
<p>This is not strictly a debate, it is simply a conversation.</p>
<p>There is no structure, there is no winners, except of course just a bit of trash talking</p>
<p>to keep it fun.</p>
<p>Some of these topics will be very difficult and I hope you can keep an open mind and have</p>
<p>patience with me as the kind of moderator who tries to bring out the best in each person</p>
<p>and the ideas discussed.</p>
<p>Okay that&rsquo;s my comment on the word Debate.</p>
<p>Now onto the word Nationalism.</p>
<p>This debate could have been called Nationalism versus Individualism or National Conservatism</p>
<p>versus Individualism or just Conservatism versus Individualism.</p>
<p>As we discussed in this episode, these words have slightly different meanings depending</p>
<p>on who you ask.</p>
<p>This is especially true, I think, for any word that ends in &ldquo;-ism&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I personally enjoy the discussion of the meaning of such philosophical words.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible to arrive at a perfect definition that everybody agrees with,</p>
<p>but the process of trying to do so for a bit is interesting and productive, at least to</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>As long as we don&rsquo;t get stuck there, as some folks sometimes do in these conversations.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Readman Podcast, to support it please check out our sponsors in the description</p>
<p>and now here&rsquo;s my conversation with Yoram Brooke and Yoram Hosoni.</p>
<p>I attended the excellent debate between the two of you yesterday at UT Austin.</p>
<p>The debate was between ideas of Conservatism, represented by Yoram Hosoni, and ideas of</p>
<p>Individualism, represented by Yoram Brooke.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the topics of the debate.</p>
<p>Yoram, how do you define Conservatism, maybe in the way you were thinking about it yesterday?</p>
<p>What to you are some principles of Conservatism?</p>
<p>Let me define it and then we can get into principles if you want.</p>
<p>When I talk about political Conservatism, I&rsquo;m talking about a political standpoint that</p>
<p>regards the recovery, elaboration, and restoration of tradition as the key to maintaining a nation</p>
<p>and strengthening it through time.</p>
<p>This is something that if you have time to talk about it like we do on the show, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worth emphasizing that Conservatism is not like Liberalism or Marxism.</p>
<p>Liberalism and Marxism are both kind of universal theories and they claim to be able to tell</p>
<p>you what&rsquo;s good for human beings at all times in all places.</p>
<p>And Conservatism is a little bit different because it&rsquo;s going to carry different values</p>
<p>in every nation, in every tribe.</p>
<p>Even every family, you can say, has somewhat different values and these loyalty groups,</p>
<p>they compete with one another.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way human beings work.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s deeply rooted in history of that particular area of land.</p>
<p>Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily say land, you&rsquo;re right that many forms of Conservatism are</p>
<p>tied to a particular place.</p>
<p>So how does the implementation of Conservatism to you differ from the ideal of Conservatism,</p>
<p>the implementations you&rsquo;ve seen of political Conservatism in the United States and the</p>
<p>rest of the world?</p>
<p>Just to give some context, because it&rsquo;s a loaded term, like most political terms.</p>
<p>So when people think about conservative in the United States, they think about the Republican</p>
<p>Party, what, can you kind of disambiguate some of this, what are we supposed to think</p>
<p>about?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a really important question.</p>
<p>Usually the word conservative is associated with Edmund Burke and with the English common</p>
<p>law tradition.</p>
<p>Going back centuries and centuries, there&rsquo;s kind of a classical English conservative tradition</p>
<p>that goes Fortescue, Hooker, Coke, Seldon, Hale, Burke, Blackstone before Burke.</p>
<p>If you take that kind of as a benchmark and you compare it, then you can compare it to</p>
<p>things like the American Federalist Party at the time of the American founding is in</p>
<p>many respects very much in keeping with that tradition.</p>
<p>As you go forward, there&rsquo;s an increasing mix of liberalism into conservatism.</p>
<p>I think by the time you get to the 1960s with William Buckley and Frank Meyer, the jargon</p>
<p>term is fusionism.</p>
<p>By the time you get there, it&rsquo;s arguable that their conservatism isn&rsquo;t very conservative</p>
<p>anymore, that it&rsquo;s kind of a public liberalism mixed with a private conservatism.</p>
<p>So a lot of the debate that we have today about what does the word conservatism actually</p>
<p>mean, a lot of the confusion comes from that, comes from the fact that on the one hand,</p>
<p>we have people who use the term, I think properly historically to refer to this common law tradition</p>
<p>of which Burke was a spokesman, but there are lots of other people who when they say</p>
<p>conservative, they just mean liberal.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a big problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a problem just to have an intelligent debate is difficult when people are using</p>
<p>the word almost too antithetical.</p>
<p>What would you say the essential idea of conservatism is time?</p>
<p>You mentioned your father&rsquo;s a physicist.</p>
<p>So a lot of physicists when they form models of the universe, they don&rsquo;t consider time.</p>
<p>So everything is dealt with instantaneously.</p>
<p>A particle is represented fully by its current state, velocity and position.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying, so you&rsquo;re arguing with all of physics and your father, as we always do,</p>
<p>that their time matters in conservatism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the fundamental element is the full history matters and you cannot separate the</p>
<p>individual from the history, from the roots that they come from.</p>
<p>The parallel in political theory is what&rsquo;s called rationalism.</p>
<p>I guess we&rsquo;ll probably talk about that some.</p>
<p>Rationalism is kind of an instantaneous, timeless thing.</p>
<p>Before I mentioned that liberalism and various enlightenment theories, they don&rsquo;t include</p>
<p>time at all.</p>
<p>Their goal is to say, look, there&rsquo;s such a thing as universal human reason.</p>
<p>All human beings, if they reason properly, will come to the same conclusions.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s true, then it removes the time consideration.</p>
<p>It removes tradition and context because everywhere where you are at any time, you ought to be</p>
<p>able to use reason and come to the same conclusions about politics or morals.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a theory like Immanuel Kant or John Locke is an example, Hobbes is an example.</p>
<p>That kind of political theorizing really does say at a given instant, we can know pretty</p>
<p>much everything that we need to know, at least the big things.</p>
<p>And conservatism is the opposite.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a traditionalist view, exactly as you say, that says that history is crucial.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re on, you say that history is interesting, but perhaps not crucial if in the context</p>
<p>of individualism.</p>
<p>No, I mean, I think there&rsquo;s a false dichotomy he presented here, and that is that one view</p>
<p>holds that you can derive anything from a particular historical path and kind of an</p>
<p>empirical view.</p>
<p>And if we know the history, we know where we should be tomorrow.</p>
<p>We know where we should stand today.</p>
<p>And the other path is we ignore history, we ignore facts, we ignore what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>We can derive from some a priori axioms, we can derive a truth right now.</p>
<p>And both are false.</p>
<p>Both of those views, in my view, are false.</p>
<p>And you know, Ayn Rand and I reject both of those views.</p>
<p>And I think the better thinkers of the Enlightenment did as well, although they sometimes fall</p>
<p>into the trap of appearing like rationalists.</p>
<p>And Jorm and I agree on one thing, and that is that Kant is one of, you know, we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about this in the past, Alex, but we both hate Kant.</p>
<p>We both think Kant is, I at least think Kant is probably the most destructive philosopher</p>
<p>since Plato, who was pretty destructive himself.</p>
<p>And part of the problem is that Kant divorces reason from reality.</p>
<p>That is, he divorces reason from history.</p>
<p>He divorces reason from experience, because we don&rsquo;t have direct experience of reality</p>
<p>according to Kant, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re removed from that direct experience.</p>
<p>But I view Kant as the anti Enlightenment, that is, I view Kant as the destroyer of good</p>
<p>Enlightenment thinking.</p>
<p>And I acknowledge a lot of history of philosophy, people who do history of philosophy view Kant</p>
<p>as the embodiment of the Enlightenment, that is the ultimate.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s a mistake.</p>
<p>I think both Rousseau and Kant are fundamentally the goal, the mission in life is to destroy</p>
<p>the Enlightenment.</p>
<p>So my view is neither of those options are the right option.</p>
<p>That is, the true reason based, reason is not divorced from reality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite the opposite.</p>
<p>Reason is a tool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a faculty of identifying and integrating what?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s identifying and integrating the facts of reality as we know them through sense perception</p>
<p>or through the study of history, through what actually happened.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the integration of those facts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the knowledge of that history.</p>
<p>And then what we do is we abstract away principles based on what&rsquo;s worked in the past, what hasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worked in the past, the consequences of different ideas, different past, different actions.</p>
<p>We abstract away principles that then can be universal.</p>
<p>Not always.</p>
<p>We make mistakes, right?</p>
<p>We can come up with a universal principle, it turns out it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>But if we have the whole scope of human history, we can derive principles as we do in life,</p>
<p>as individuals, we derive principles that are then truths that we can live by, but you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do that by ignoring history.</p>
<p>You do that by learning history, by understanding history, by understanding in a sense tradition</p>
<p>and where it leads to, and then trying to do better.</p>
<p>And I think good thinkers are constantly trying to do better based on what they know about</p>
<p>the past and what they know about the present.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between studying history on a journey of reason and tradition?</p>
<p>So you mentioned that Burke understood that reason begins with an inherited tradition</p>
<p>yesterday.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the difference between studying history, but then being free to go any way</p>
<p>you want and tradition where it feels more, I don&rsquo;t want to say a negative term like burden,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s more of a momentum that forces you to go the same way as your ancestors.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the recognition that people are wrong, often are wrong.</p>
<p>Including parents?</p>
<p>Including your parents, including your teachers, including everybody.</p>
<p>Everybody is potentially wrong, and that you can&rsquo;t accept anybody just because they happen</p>
<p>to come before you.</p>
<p>That is, you have to evaluate and judge, and you have to have a standard by which to evaluate</p>
<p>and judge the actions of those who came before you, whether they are your parents, whether</p>
<p>they are the state in which you happen to be born, whether they are somebody on the</p>
<p>other side of planet Earth.</p>
<p>You can judge them if you have a standard.</p>
<p>And my standard, and I think the right standard, is human well being.</p>
<p>That which is good for human beings, qua human beings, is the standard by which we judge.</p>
<p>I can say that certain periods of history were bad.</p>
<p>They happened.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to study them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand what they did that made them bad so we cannot do that again.</p>
<p>And I can say certain cultures, certain periods in time were good.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because they promoted human well being and human flourishing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the standard.</p>
<p>To derive from that, okay, what is it that made a particular culture good?</p>
<p>What is it that made that particular culture positive in terms of human well being and</p>
<p>human flourishing?</p>
<p>What made this bad?</p>
<p>And hopefully from that, I can derive a principle.</p>
<p>Okay, if I want human flourishing and human well being in the future, I want to be more</p>
<p>like these guys and less like those guys.</p>
<p>I want to derive what is the principle that will guide me in the future.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s I think how human knowledge ultimately develops.</p>
<p>I think people often make a mistake, I&rsquo;m not saying your own, but lots of people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>actually read the original sources and so what happens is people will attack conservatives</p>
<p>assuming that conservatives think that whatever comes from the past is right.</p>
<p>And actually, it&rsquo;s very difficult to find a thinker who actually says something like</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>Seldon or Burke, the big conservative theorists hooker, they&rsquo;re all people who understand</p>
<p>that the tradition carries with it mistakes that were made in the past.</p>
<p>And this is actually I think an important part of their empiricism is that they see</p>
<p>the search for truth as something a society does by trial and error.</p>
<p>And what that means is that in any given moment, you have to be aware of the possibility that</p>
<p>things that you&rsquo;ve inherited are actually false.</p>
<p>And the job of the political thinker or the jurist or the philosopher is not to dig in</p>
<p>and say whatever it is that we&rsquo;ve inherited is right.</p>
<p>The job is to look at the society as a whole and say, look, we have this job of first of</p>
<p>all conservation, just making sure that we don&rsquo;t lose good things that we&rsquo;ve had.</p>
<p>And second, seeing if we can repair things in order to improve them where it&rsquo;s necessary</p>
<p>or where it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>And that process is actually a creative process.</p>
<p>This is a way in which I think it is similar to Jeroen&rsquo;s philosophy that you take the</p>
<p>inherited tradition and you look for a way that you can shape it in order to make it</p>
<p>something better than it was.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a baseline for what we call conservatism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, yeah.</p>
<p>Just a comment.</p>
<p>So the trial and error, the errors is, you&rsquo;re proud of the errors.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>So you mentioned trial and error a few times yesterday, it&rsquo;s a really interesting kind</p>
<p>of idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically accepting that the journey is going to have flaws as opposed to saying,</p>
<p>I mean, the conclusion there is the current system is flawed and it will always be flawed</p>
<p>and you try to improve it.</p>
<p>When you listen to your on talk, there&rsquo;s much more of an optimism for the system being perfect</p>
<p>now or potentially soon, or it could be perfect.</p>
<p>And to me, the way I heard it is almost like accepting that the system is flawed and through</p>
<p>trial and error will improve and Jeroen says, no, we can have a perfection now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way it sounds to me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I think the difference is that at some point, just like in science, I think one can stop</p>
<p>the trial and error and say, I can now see a pattern here.</p>
<p>I can see that certain actions lead to bad consequences, certain actions lead to good</p>
<p>consequences.</p>
<p>Let me try to abstract away what is it that is good and what is it that is bad and build</p>
<p>a system around what is good and reject what is bad.</p>
<p>I think ultimately, if you read the founding fathers and whether we call them conservatives</p>
<p>or individuals, what the founding fathers actually did, all of them, I think, is study</p>
<p>history.</p>
<p>They all did.</p>
<p>They all talk about history.</p>
<p>They all talk about examples of other cultures, whether they go back to the Republic in Venice</p>
<p>or back to the ancient Greeks.</p>
<p>They studied these.</p>
<p>They learned lessons from them.</p>
<p>They try to figure out what has worked in the past and what hasn&rsquo;t and try to derive</p>
<p>principles.</p>
<p>They got pretty close to what I would consider kind of an ideal, but they didn&rsquo;t get it</p>
<p>completely right.</p>
<p>Here we sit 200 and something years after the Declaration and after the Constitution.</p>
<p>I think we can look back and say, okay, well, what did they get right?</p>
<p>What did they get wrong based on how is it done and where are the flaws and we can improve</p>
<p>on it.</p>
<p>I think we can get closer to perfection based on those kind of observations, based on that</p>
<p>kind of abstraction, that kind of discovery of what is true.</p>
<p>Just like at some point, you do the experiments, you do the trial and error, and now you come</p>
<p>up with a scientific principle.</p>
<p>It is true that 100 years later, you might discover that, hey, I missed something, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something, but to not take the full lesson, to insist on incrementalism, to insist on</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just going to tinker with the system instead of saying, no, there&rsquo;s something really</p>
<p>wrong with having a king, there&rsquo;s something really wrong with not having any representation,</p>
<p>whatever the standard needs to be in the name of we don&rsquo;t want to move too fast, I think</p>
<p>is a mistake.</p>
<p>The problem with trial and error in politics is that we&rsquo;re talking about human life, right?</p>
<p>So there was a big trial around communism, and 100 million people paid the price for</p>
<p>the trial.</p>
<p>I could have told them in advance, as did many people, that it would not work.</p>
<p>There are principles of human nature, principles that we can study from history, principles</p>
<p>about economics and other aspects.</p>
<p>Well, we know it&rsquo;s not going to work.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to try it again.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had communal arrangements throughout history.</p>
<p>There was an experiment with fascism, and there have been experiments with all kinds</p>
<p>of political systems.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;ve done them.</p>
<p>Sad that we did them, because many of us knew they wouldn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>We should learn the lesson, and I think that all of history now converges on one lesson,</p>
<p>and that is what we need to do is build systems that protect individual freedom.</p>
<p>That is the core.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what ultimately leads to human flourishing and human success and human achievement, and</p>
<p>to the extent that we place anything above that individual, whether it&rsquo;s the state, whether</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the ethnicity, whether it&rsquo;s the race, whether it&rsquo;s the bourgeois, whatever it happens</p>
<p>to be, class or whatever, whenever we place something above the individual, the consequence</p>
<p>is negative.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of these principles that I think we can derive from studying 3,000 years of</p>
<p>civilization.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tragic, I think, because we&rsquo;re going to keep experimenting, sadly.</p>
<p>I see it, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not winning this battle.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m losing the battle.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to keep experimenting with different forms of collectivism, and we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>keep paying the price in human life and in missed opportunities for human flourishing</p>
<p>and human success and human wealth and prosperity.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take communism as a good example.</p>
<p>None of the major conservative thinkers would say, you know what&rsquo;s a good idea?</p>
<p>A good idea would be to experiment by raising everything that we&rsquo;ve inherited and starting</p>
<p>from scratch.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the conservative complaint or accusation against rationalists as opposed</p>
<p>to empiricists.</p>
<p>I mean, using rationalism, let&rsquo;s take Descartes kind of as a benchmark.</p>
<p>Can you also maybe define rationalism?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>These are two terms that are in philosophy, especially in epistemology.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re often compared to one another.</p>
<p>Jeroen said that it&rsquo;s a false dichotomy, and maybe it is a bit exaggerated, but that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mean it&rsquo;s not useful for conceptualizing the domain.</p>
<p>So a rationalist is somebody like Descartes who says, I&rsquo;m going to set aside, I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to try to set aside everything I know, everything I&rsquo;ve inherited, I&rsquo;m going to start from scratch.</p>
<p>And he explicitly says, in evaluating the inheritance of the past, he explicitly says,</p>
<p>you take a look at the histories that we have, they&rsquo;re not reliable.</p>
<p>You take a look at the moral and the scientific writings that we receive, they&rsquo;re not very</p>
<p>good.</p>
<p>His baseline is to look very critically at the past and say, look, I&rsquo;m evaluating it.</p>
<p>I think all in all, it&rsquo;s just not worth very much.</p>
<p>And so whatever I do, beginning from scratch, is going to be better as long as, and here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>his caveat, as long as I&rsquo;m proceeding from self evident assumptions, from self evident</p>
<p>premises, things that you can&rsquo;t argue against.</p>
<p>I think, therefore, I am.</p>
<p>And then from there, deducing what he calls infallible conclusions.</p>
<p>So that model of self evident premises to infallible conclusions, I&rsquo;m calling that rationalism,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s kind of a standard academic jargon term.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s opposed to empiricism, which is a thinker, I think in universities, usually</p>
<p>the empiricist is David Hume.</p>
<p>And David Hume will say, we can&rsquo;t learn anything the way that Descartes said.</p>
<p>There is nothing that&rsquo;s that self evident and that infallible.</p>
<p>So Hume proposes, based on Newton and Boyle and the new physical sciences.</p>
<p>So Hume proposes a science of man.</p>
<p>And the science of man sounds an awful lot like what Yaron just said, which is we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to take a look at human nature, at the nature of societies.</p>
<p>Human nature, we&rsquo;re going to try to abstract towards fixed principles for describing it.</p>
<p>Human societies, we&rsquo;re going to try to do the same thing.</p>
<p>And from there, we get, for example, contemporary economics.</p>
<p>But we also get sociology and anthropology, which cut in a different direction.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s rationalism versus empiricism.</p>
<p>Can I just say?</p>
<p>Yeah, go ahead, please.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree with that.</p>
<p>I think empiricism, the one thing I disagree is I think empiricism rarely comes to these</p>
<p>abstractions.</p>
<p>I mean, they want more facts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always about collecting more evidence.</p>
<p>But this is where I think Ayn Rand is so unusual and where I think there&rsquo;s something new here.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a bold statement given the history of philosophy.</p>
<p>But I think Ayn Rand is something new.</p>
<p>And so she says, yes, we agree about rationalism and that it&rsquo;s inherently wrong.</p>
<p>Empiricism has the problem of, OK, where does it lead?</p>
<p>You never come to a conclusion.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just accumulating evidence.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something in addition.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a third alternative, which she is positing, which is using empirical evidence,</p>
<p>not denying empirical evidence, recognizing that there are some axioms, there are some</p>
<p>axioms that we all, at the base of all of our knowledge, that are starting points.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not rejecting axiomatic knowledge.</p>
<p>And integrating those two and identifying the fact that based on these axioms and based</p>
<p>on these empirical evidence, we can come to truths.</p>
<p>Just again, like we do in science, we have certain axioms, scientific axioms, we have</p>
<p>certain experiments that we run, and then we can come to some identification of a truth.</p>
<p>And that truth is always going to be challenged by new information, by new knowledge.</p>
<p>But as long as that&rsquo;s what we know, that is what truth is.</p>
<p>So truth is contextual in the sense that it&rsquo;s contextual, it&rsquo;s based on that knowledge that</p>
<p>surrounds it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always available to change if you get new facts.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always available to change if the facts that you get, and they really are, I mean,</p>
<p>the burden of changing what you&rsquo;ve come to a conclusion of truth is high, so you&rsquo;d have</p>
<p>to have real evidence that it&rsquo;s not true, but that happens all the time.</p>
<p>So it happens in science, right?</p>
<p>We discovered that what we thought was true is not true, and it can happen in politics</p>
<p>and ethics even more so than in science because they&rsquo;re much messier fields.</p>
<p>But the idea is that you can come to a truth, but it&rsquo;s not just deductive.</p>
<p>Most truths are inductive.</p>
<p>We learn from observing reality and, again, coming to principles about what works and</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>And here I think this is‚ÄîAyn Rand is different.</p>
<p>She doesn&rsquo;t fall into the‚Äîand she&rsquo;s different in her politics, and she&rsquo;s different in</p>
<p>her epistemology.</p>
<p>She doesn&rsquo;t fall into the conventional view.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s an opponent of Hume, and she&rsquo;s an opponent of Descartes, and she&rsquo;s certainly</p>
<p>an opponent of Kant.</p>
<p>And I think she&rsquo;s right, right?</p>
<p>So‚Äî</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s okay, can we walk back to criticism of communism?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re both critics of communism and socialism.</p>
<p>Why did communism fail?</p>
<p>You started to say that conservatives criticize it on the basis of rationalism, that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>throwing away the past.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re starting from scratch.</p>
<p>Is that the fundamental description of why communism failed?</p>
<p>I think the fundamental difference between rationalists and empiricists is the question</p>
<p>of whether you&rsquo;re throwing away the past.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the argument.</p>
<p>And it cashes out as a distinction between abstract, universal, rationalist political</p>
<p>theories and empirical political theories.</p>
<p>Artificial political theories, they&rsquo;re always going to say something like, look, there are</p>
<p>many different societies.</p>
<p>We can say that some are better and some are worse, but the problem is that there are many</p>
<p>different ways in which a society can be better or worse.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an ongoing competition, and we&rsquo;re learning on an ongoing basis what are the</p>
<p>ways in which societies can be better and worse.</p>
<p>That creates a kind of, I&rsquo;d say, a mild skepticism, a moderate skepticism among conservatives.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think too many conservatives have a problem looking at the Soviet Union, which</p>
<p>is brutal and murderous, ineffective in its economics, totally ineffective spiritually,</p>
<p>and then collapsed.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s easier for us to look at a system like that and say, what on earth?</p>
<p>What should we learn from that?</p>
<p>But the main conservative tradition is pretty tolerant of a diversity of different kinds</p>
<p>of society and is slow to insist that France is so tyrannical, it just needs a revolution</p>
<p>because what&rsquo;s going to come after the revolution is going to be much better.</p>
<p>The assumption is that there&rsquo;s lots of things that are good about most societies and that</p>
<p>a clean slate leads you to throw out all of the inherited things that you don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>how to notice until they&rsquo;re gone.</p>
<p>LW.</p>
<p>Could I actually play devil&rsquo;s advocate here and address something you also said?</p>
<p>Can we, as opposed to knowing the empirical data of the 20th century that communism presented,</p>
<p>can we go back to the beginning of the 20th century?</p>
<p>Can you empathize or steel man or put yourself in a place of the Soviet Union where the workers</p>
<p>are being disrespected?</p>
<p>And can you not see that the conservatives could be pro communism?</p>
<p>Communism is such a strongly negative word in modern day political discourse that you</p>
<p>have to put yourself in the mind of people who like red colors, it&rsquo;s all about the branding,</p>
<p>I think, but also like the ideas of solidarity, of nation, of togetherness, of respect for</p>
<p>fellow man.</p>
<p>I mean, all of these things that communism represents, can you not see that this idea</p>
<p>is actually going along with conservatism?</p>
<p>It is in some ways respecting the deep ideals of the past, but proposing a new way to raise</p>
<p>those ideals, implement those ideals in the system.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m going to try to do what you&rsquo;re suggesting, but historically we actually have a more</p>
<p>useful option, I think, for both of our positions.</p>
<p>Instead of pretending that we like the actual communists, we have conservative statesmen</p>
<p>like Disraeli and Bismarck who initiated social legislation.</p>
<p>The first step towards saying, look, we&rsquo;re one nation, we&rsquo;re undergoing industrialization,</p>
<p>that industrialization is important and positive, but it&rsquo;s also doing a lot of damage to a lot</p>
<p>of people.</p>
<p>And in particular, it&rsquo;s doing damage not just to individuals and families, but it&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>damage to the social fabric, the capacity of Britain or German to remain cohesive societies</p>
<p>is being harmed.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s these two conservative statesmen, Disraeli and Bismarck, who actually take the</p>
<p>first steps in order to legislate for what today we would consider to be minimal social</p>
<p>programs, pensions and disability insurance and those kinds of things.</p>
<p>So for sure, conservatives do look at industrialization as a rapid change and they say, we do have</p>
<p>to care about the nation as a whole and we have to care about it as a unit.</p>
<p>And I assume that your own will say, look, that&rsquo;s the first step towards the catastrophe</p>
<p>of communism.</p>
<p>But before your own drives that nail into the coffin, let me try to make a distinction</p>
<p>because when you read Marx, you&rsquo;re reading an intellectual descendant of Descartes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re reading somebody who says, look, every society consists of oppressors and oppressed.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an improvement in some ways over liberal thinking because at least he&rsquo;s seeing</p>
<p>groups as a real social phenomenon.</p>
<p>But he says, every society has an oppressor class and oppressed class.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re different classes, they&rsquo;re different groups, and whenever one is stronger, it exploits</p>
<p>the ones that are weaker.</p>
<p>That is the foundation of a revolutionary political theory.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because the moment that you say that the only relationship between the stronger and the</p>
<p>weaker is exploitation.</p>
<p>The moment that you say that, then you&rsquo;re pushed into the position and Marx and Engels</p>
<p>say this explicitly, you&rsquo;re pushed into the position.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re saying, when will the exploitation end?</p>
<p>Never until there&rsquo;s a revolution.</p>
<p>What happens when there&rsquo;s a revolution?</p>
<p>You eliminate the oppressor class.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s annihilationist.</p>
<p>I mean, you can immediately when you read it, see why it&rsquo;s different from Descartes</p>
<p>or Bismarck because they&rsquo;re trying to keep everybody somehow at peace with one another.</p>
<p>And Marx is saying, there is no peace.</p>
<p>That oppressor class has to be annihilated.</p>
<p>And then they go ahead and do it, and they kill 100 million people.</p>
<p>So I do think that despite the fact your question is good and right, there are certain similarities</p>
<p>and concern, but still I think you can tell the difference.</p>
<p>That extra step of revolution to you is where the problem comes.</p>
<p>That extra step of let&rsquo;s kill all the oppressors, that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>And then to you, the whole step one is the problem.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s all a problem.</p>
<p>First I don&rsquo;t view communism as something that radical in a sense that I think it comes</p>
<p>from a tradition of collectivism.</p>
<p>I think it comes from a tradition of looking at groups and measuring things in terms of</p>
<p>groups.</p>
<p>It comes from tradition where you expect some people to be sacrificed for the greater good</p>
<p>of the whole.</p>
<p>I think it comes from a tradition where mysticism or revelation as the source of truth is accepted.</p>
<p>I view Marx as in some sense very Christian.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s this radical rejecting, I think he&rsquo;s just reformatting Christianity</p>
<p>in a sense.</p>
<p>In a sense he&rsquo;s replacing God with the proletarian.</p>
<p>Knowledge you have to get knowledge from somewhere, so you need the dictatorship of the proletarian,</p>
<p>you need somebody, the Stalin, the Lenin who somehow communes with the spirit, the spirit</p>
<p>of the proletarian.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no rationality, not rationalism, there&rsquo;s no rationality in Marx.</p>
<p>There is a lot of mysticism and there is a lot of hand waving and there&rsquo;s a lot of sacrifice</p>
<p>and a lot of original sin in the way he views humanity.</p>
<p>So I view Marx as one more collectivist in a whole string of collectivists.</p>
<p>And I think the Bismarckian response, I know less about Disraeli so I&rsquo;ll focus on Bismarck,</p>
<p>and Bismarck is really responding to political pressures from the left and he&rsquo;s responding</p>
<p>to the rise of communism, socialism, but what Bismarck is doing, he&rsquo;s putting something</p>
<p>alternative, he&rsquo;s presenting an alternative to the proletarian as the standard by which</p>
<p>we should measure the good.</p>
<p>And what he&rsquo;s replacing it as the state, he&rsquo;s replacing the proletarian with the state,</p>
<p>and that has exactly the same problems.</p>
<p>That is first it requires sacrificing some to others, which is what the welfare state</p>
<p>basically legitimizes.</p>
<p>It places the state above all, so the state now becomes I think the biggest evil of Bismarck</p>
<p>and I definitely view him as a negative force in history, is public education.</p>
<p>I mean the Germans really dig in on public education, really develop it, and really the</p>
<p>American model of public education is copying the German, the Prussian Bismarckian public</p>
<p>education.</p>
<p>Can you speak to that real quick, why the public education is such a root of moral evil</p>
<p>for you?</p>
<p>Well because it now says that there&rsquo;s one standard and that standard is determined by</p>
<p>government, by a bureaucracy, by whatever the government deems is in the national interest,</p>
<p>and Bismarck is very explicit about this.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s training the workers of the future, they need to catch up with England and other places</p>
<p>and they need to train the workers and he&rsquo;s going to train some people to be the managerial</p>
<p>classes, he&rsquo;s going to train other people to be ‚Äì and he decides, right, the government,</p>
<p>the bureaucracy is going to decide who&rsquo;s who and where they go.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no individual choice, there&rsquo;s no individual showing an ability to break out of what the</p>
<p>government has decided is their little box, there&rsquo;s very little freedom, there&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>little ‚Äì you know, ultimately there&rsquo;s very little competition, there&rsquo;s very little</p>
<p>innovation, and this is the problem we have today in American education, which we can</p>
<p>get to, is there&rsquo;s no competition and no innovation.</p>
<p>We have one standard, fit all, and then we have conflicts about what should be taught,</p>
<p>and the conflicts now are not pedagogical, they&rsquo;re not about what works and what doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Nobody cares about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about political agendas, right, it&rsquo;s about what my group wants to be taught and</p>
<p>what that group wants to be taught, rather than actually discovering how do we get kids</p>
<p>to read?</p>
<p>I mean, we all know how to get kids to read, but there&rsquo;s a political agenda around not</p>
<p>teaching phonics, for example.</p>
<p>So a lot of schools don&rsquo;t teach phonics, even though the kids will never learn how</p>
<p>to read properly.</p>
<p>So it becomes politics, and I don&rsquo;t believe politics belongs in education.</p>
<p>I think education is a product, it&rsquo;s a service, and we know how to deliver products and services</p>
<p>really, really efficiently at a really, really low price at a really, really high quality,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s leaving it to the market to do.</p>
<p>But your fundamental criticism is that the state can use education to further its authoritarian</p>
<p>aims.</p>
<p>Well, or whatever the aims ‚Äì I mean, think about the conservative today critique of American</p>
<p>educational system, right, it&rsquo;s dominated by the left.</p>
<p>Yeah, what did you expect, right?</p>
<p>If you leave it up to the state to fund, they&rsquo;re going to fund the things that promote state</p>
<p>growth and state intervention, and the left is better at that.</p>
<p>It has been better at that than the right, and they now dominate our educational institutions.</p>
<p>But look, if we go back to Bismarck, my problem is placing the state above the individual.</p>
<p>So if communism places the class above the individual, what matters is class, individuals,</p>
<p>and nothing, they&rsquo;re cogs in a machine.</p>
<p>Bismarck, certainly the German tradition much more than the British tradition or the American</p>
<p>tradition, the German tradition is to place the state above the individual.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s equally evil, and the outcome is fascism, and the outcome is the same.</p>
<p>The outcome is the deaths of tens of millions of people when taken to its ultimate conclusion.</p>
<p>Just like socialism, the ultimate conclusion of it is communism, you know, nationalism</p>
<p>in that form, kind of the Bismarckian form, the ultimate conclusion is Nazism or some</p>
<p>form of fascism.</p>
<p>Because you don&rsquo;t care about the individual, the individual doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>I think this is one of the differences in the Anglo, you know, Anglo American tradition</p>
<p>where the Anglo American tradition, even the conservatives, have always acknowledged and</p>
<p>it goes back to&hellip;</p>
<p>Especially the conservatives.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well&hellip;</p>
<p>The conservatives were there first.</p>
<p>They acknowledged.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ve defined conservatives to include all the good thinkers of the distant past,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all good thinkers.</p>
<p>We agree on that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m defining conservatism the way that Burke does.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just&hellip;</p>
<p>Look, this is a very simple observation.</p>
<p>Burke thinks, when you open Burke and you actually read him, he starts naming all of</p>
<p>these people who he&rsquo;s defending.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s bizarre, I&rsquo;m sorry, it&rsquo;s just intellectual sloppiness for people to be publishing books</p>
<p>called Burke, The First Conservative, The Founding Conservative, The Found&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, this is nonstop, it&rsquo;s a view that says Burke reacts to the French Revolution,</p>
<p>so conservatism has no prior tradition, it&rsquo;s just reacting to the French Revolution.</p>
<p>And this is&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, this is just absurd.</p>
<p>Can I ask a quick question on conservatism?</p>
<p>Are there any conservatives that are embracing of revolutions?</p>
<p>So are they ultimately against the concept of revolution?</p>
<p>Yes, Burke himself embraces the Polish Revolution, which takes place almost exactly at the same</p>
<p>time as the French Revolution.</p>
<p>And the argument is really interesting because there&rsquo;s a common mistake is assuming that</p>
<p>Burke and conservative thinkers are always in favor of slow change.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s also just factually mistaken.</p>
<p>Burke is against the French Revolution because he thinks that there are actually tried and</p>
<p>true things that work, things that work for human flourishing and freedom included as</p>
<p>a very important part of human flourishing.</p>
<p>He like many others takes the English constitution to be a model of something that works.</p>
<p>So it has a king, it has various other things that maybe your own will say, well, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a mistake, but still for centuries, it&rsquo;s the leader in many things that I think we can</p>
<p>easily agree are human flourishing.</p>
<p>And Burke says, look, what&rsquo;s wrong with the French Revolution?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s wrong with the French Revolution is that they have a system that has all sorts</p>
<p>of problems, but they could be repairing it.</p>
<p>And instead what they&rsquo;re doing by overthrowing everything is they&rsquo;re moving away from what</p>
<p>we know is good for human beings.</p>
<p>Then he looks at the Polish Revolution and he says, the Poles do the opposite.</p>
<p>The Poles have a nonfunctioning traditional constitution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too democratic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible to raise armies and to defend the country because of the fact that every</p>
<p>nobleman has a veto.</p>
<p>So the Polish Revolution moves in the direction of the British constitution.</p>
<p>They repair their constitution through a quick, a rapid revolution.</p>
<p>They install a king along the model that looks a lot like Britain and Burke supports it.</p>
<p>He says, this is a good revolution.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not the need to quickly make a change in order to save yourself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what conservatives are objecting to.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;re objecting to is instead of looking at experience in order to try to make a slow</p>
<p>or quick improvement, a measured improvement to achieve a particular goal, instead of doing</p>
<p>that, you say, look, the whole thing has just been wrong.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;ve really got to do is annihilate a certain part of the population and then</p>
<p>make completely new laws and a completely new theory.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s objecting to.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the French Revolution.</p>
<p>And that then becomes the model for communist revolutions.</p>
<p>And for me, I mean, the French Revolution is clearly a real evil and wrong, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not that it was a revolution and it&rsquo;s not that it tried to change everything.</p>
<p>I mean, let&rsquo;s remember what was going on in France at the time and people were starving</p>
<p>and the monarchy in particular was completely detached, completely detached from the suffering</p>
<p>of the people and something needed to change.</p>
<p>The unfortunate thing is that the change was motivated by an egalitarian philosophy, not</p>
<p>egalitarian in the sense that I think the Fauny Fathers talked about, but egalitarian</p>
<p>in the sense of real equality, equality of outcome, motivated by a philosophy, by Rousseau&rsquo;s</p>
<p>philosophy, and inevitably led, you could tell that the ideas were going to lead to</p>
<p>this, to massive destruction and death and the annihilation of a class.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, annihilation is never an option.</p>
<p>That is, it&rsquo;s not true that a good revolution never leads to mass death of just whole groups</p>
<p>of people because a good revolution is about the sanctity of the individual.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about preservation, liberty of the individual.</p>
<p>And again, that goes back to, and the French Revolution denies and Rousseau denies really</p>
<p>that in civilization there is a value in a thing called the individual.</p>
<p>I think this is a good place to have this discussion.</p>
<p>The Fauny Fathers of the United States, are they individualists or are they conservatives?</p>
<p>So in this particular revolution that founded this country, at the core of which are some</p>
<p>fascinating, some powerful ideas, were those founding fathers, were those ideas coming</p>
<p>from a place of conservatism or did they put primary value into the freedom and the power</p>
<p>of the individual?</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>There were both.</p>
<p>I mean, this is something that&rsquo;s a little bit difficult sometimes for Americans, I mean,</p>
<p>very educated Americans, they talk about the founding fathers as though it&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>this collective entity with a single brain and a single value system.</p>
<p>But I think at the time that&rsquo;s not the way any of them saw it.</p>
<p>So roughly there&rsquo;s two camps and they map onto the rationalist versus traditionalist</p>
<p>empiricist dichotomy that I proposed earlier.</p>
<p>So on the one hand, you have real revolutionaries like Jefferson and Paine.</p>
<p>These are the people who Burke was writing against.</p>
<p>These are the people who supported the French Revolution.</p>
<p>So when you say real, so when you say Paine, you&rsquo;re referring to revolutionaries in a bad</p>
<p>way, like this is a problem.</p>
<p>These are people who will say history up until now has been, with Descartes, but applied</p>
<p>to politics.</p>
<p>History up until now has been just a story of ugliness, foolishness, stupidity, and evil.</p>
<p>And if you apply reason, we&rsquo;ll all come to the same conclusions.</p>
<p>Paine writes a book called The Age of Reason, and The Age of Reason is a manifesto for here</p>
<p>is the answer to political and moral problems throughout history.</p>
<p>We have the answers.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s in the same school as Rousseau&rsquo;s The Social Continent.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t like that?</p>
<p>Not at all.</p>
<p>Well, I thought it was the opposite.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re the opposite.</p>
<p>Okay, so let me&hellip;</p>
<p>Just to throw in a quick question on Jefferson and Paine, do you think America would exist</p>
<p>without those two figures?</p>
<p>So like how important is spice in the flavor of the dish you&rsquo;re making?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to try to run the counterfactual, I don&rsquo;t have confidence that I know the answer</p>
<p>to the question.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s so much fun.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to offer something that I think is more fun.</p>
<p>More fun than the counterfactual is America had two revolutions, not one, okay?</p>
<p>At first, there is a revolution that is strongly spiced with this kind of rationalism.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a 10 year period after the Declaration of Independence.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a 10 year period under which America has a constitution.</p>
<p>This first constitution, which today they call the Articles of the Confederation, but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a constitution from 1777.</p>
<p>And that constitution is based on, in a lot of ways, on the hottest new ideas.</p>
<p>It has, instead of the traditional British system with a division of powers between an</p>
<p>executive and a bicameral legislature, instead of that traditional English model, which most</p>
<p>of the states had as their governments, instead of that, they say, no, we&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>one elected body, okay, and that body, that Congress, it&rsquo;s going to be the executive,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be the legislative, it&rsquo;s going to be everything, and it&rsquo;s going to run as</p>
<p>a big committee.</p>
<p>These are the ideas of the French Revolution.</p>
<p>You get to actually see them implemented in Pennsylvania, in the Pennsylvania Constitution,</p>
<p>and then later in the National Assembly in France.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a disaster.</p>
<p>The thing doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely made up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s neither based on historical experience, nor is it based on historical custom, on what</p>
<p>people are used to.</p>
<p>And what they succeed in creating with this first constitution is it&rsquo;s wonderfully rational,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a complete disaster.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t allow the raising of taxes.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t allow the mustering of troops.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t allow giving orders to soldiers to fight a war.</p>
<p>And if that had continued, if that had continued to be the American Constitution, America never</p>
<p>would have been an independent country.</p>
<p>There I&rsquo;m willing to do that counterfactual.</p>
<p>What happens during those years where Washington and Jay and Knox and Hamilton and Morris,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like this group of conservatives, they&rsquo;re mostly soldiers and lawyers.</p>
<p>This is in Washington, most of them are from northern cities.</p>
<p>And this group is much more conservative than the Tom Paine and Jefferson School.</p>
<p>Some historians call them the Nationalist Party.</p>
<p>Historically, they give up the word nationalism and they call themselves the Federalists,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re basically the Nationalist Party.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>It means on the one hand that their goal is to create an independent nation, independent</p>
<p>from Britain.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, they believe that they already have national legal traditions, the</p>
<p>common law, the forms of government that have been imported from Britain, and of course</p>
<p>Christianity, which they consider to be part of their inheritance.</p>
<p>This Federalist Party is the conservative party.</p>
<p>These are people who are extremely close in ideas to Burke.</p>
<p>And these are people who wrote the Constitution of the United States, the second constitution,</p>
<p>the second revolution in 1787, when Washington leads the establishment of a new constitution,</p>
<p>which maybe technically legally, it wasn&rsquo;t even legal under the old constitution, but</p>
<p>it was democratic.</p>
<p>And what it did is it said, we&rsquo;re going to take what we know about English government,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;ve learned by applying English government in the states, we&rsquo;re going to create a national</p>
<p>government, a unified national government, that&rsquo;s going to muster power in its hands,</p>
<p>enough power to be able to do things like fighting wars to defend a unified people.</p>
<p>Those are conservatives.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s reasonable to say, well, look, there was no king, so how conservative could they</p>
<p>be?</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s a reasonable question.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t forget that the American colonies, the English colonies in America by that point</p>
<p>had been around for 150 years.</p>
<p>They had written constitutions, they had already adapted for an entire century, adapted the</p>
<p>English constitution to local conditions where there&rsquo;s no aristocracy and there&rsquo;s no king.</p>
<p>I think you can see that as a positive thing.</p>
<p>On the other hand, they have slavery, that&rsquo;s an innovation, that&rsquo;s not English.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a little bit different from the English constitution, but those men are conservatives.</p>
<p>They make the minimum changes that they need to the English constitution and they largely</p>
<p>replicate it, which is why the Jeffersonians hated them so much.</p>
<p>They call them apostates.</p>
<p>They say they&rsquo;ve betrayed equality and liberty and fraternity by adopting an English style</p>
<p>constitution.</p>
<p>So I would imagine, Yaron, you would put emphasis of the success of the key ideas at the founding</p>
<p>of this country elsewhere, at the freedom of the individual as opposed to the tradition</p>
<p>of the British empire.</p>
<p>The one thing I agree with, Yaron, is the fact that yes, the founding fathers were not</p>
<p>a monolith.</p>
<p>They argued, they debated, they disagreed, they wrote against each other.</p>
<p>Jefferson and Adams for decades didn&rsquo;t even speak to each other, though they did make</p>
<p>up and had a fascinating relationship after.</p>
<p>You and I are making up too.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the founding fathers.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s this massive debate and discussion, but I don&rsquo;t agree with the characterization</p>
<p>of Paine and Jefferson.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s just to call them rationalists because I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re rationalists.</p>
<p>People who&rsquo;ve looked at history, at the problems in history, and remember this is the 18th</p>
<p>century and they were coming out of a hundred years earlier, some of the bloodiest wars</p>
<p>in all of human history were happening in Europe, many of them over religion.</p>
<p>You know, they had seen what was going on in France and other countries where people</p>
<p>were starving and where kings were frolicking in palaces in spite of that.</p>
<p>They were very aware of the relative freedom that the British tradition had given Englishmen.</p>
<p>I think they knew that, they understood that, and I think they were building on that.</p>
<p>They were taking the observation of the past and trying to come up with a more perfect</p>
<p>system, and I think they did.</p>
<p>In that sense, I&rsquo;m a huge fan of Jefferson.</p>
<p>You know, there are two things that I think are unfortunate about Jefferson.</p>
<p>One is that he continued to hold slaves, which is very unfortunate.</p>
<p>The second is early support for the French Revolution, which I think is a massive mistake</p>
<p>and I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if he regretted it later in life, given the consequences.</p>
<p>But they were trying to derive principles by which they could establish a new state,</p>
<p>and yes, there was pushback by some and there was disagreement, and the Constitution in</p>
<p>the end is to some extent a form of compromise, it&rsquo;s still one of the great documents of</p>
<p>all of human history, political documents, the Constitution, although I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>inferior to the Declaration.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of the Declaration and I think one of the mistakes the conservatives makes,</p>
<p>one of the mistakes the Supreme Court makes and American judiciary makes is assuming the</p>
<p>two documents are separate.</p>
<p>I think Lincoln is absolutely right, you can&rsquo;t understand the Constitution without understanding</p>
<p>the Declaration, the Declaration of what set the context and what sets everything up for</p>
<p>the Constitution.</p>
<p>Individual rights are the key concept there, and one of the challenges was that some of</p>
<p>the compromises, and compromise is not necessarily between groups, but compromises that even</p>
<p>Jefferson made and others made regarding individual rights, set America on a path that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>suffering from today.</p>
<p>I mentioned three last night, one was slavery, obviously that was a horrific compromise,</p>
<p>one that America not just paid for with the Civil War, 600,000 young men died because</p>
<p>of it, but the suffering of black slaves for all those years.</p>
<p>But then the whole issue of racial tensions in this country for a century and to this</p>
<p>day really is a consequence of that initial compromise, who knows what the counterfactual</p>
<p>is in America if there&rsquo;s a Civil War right at the founding, because there would have</p>
<p>been a war no matter what, but if it had happened in the late 18th century, early 19th century,</p>
<p>rather than waiting till 1860s, but then second was Jefferson&rsquo;s embrace of public education,</p>
<p>his founding of the University of Virginia, which I think is a great tragedy, which nobody</p>
<p>agrees with me on, so that&rsquo;s one of the areas where I&rsquo;m pretty radical.</p>
<p>And then they embrace, both by Jefferson and by Hamilton, for different reasons, but an</p>
<p>embrace by both of them of government role in the economy.</p>
<p>And I do finance, so I know a little bit about finance, and the debate between Jefferson</p>
<p>and Hamilton about banking is fascinating, but at the end of the day, both wanted a role</p>
<p>for government in banking, they both didn&rsquo;t trust, Jefferson didn&rsquo;t trust big financial</p>
<p>interests, Hamilton wanted to capture some of those financial interests for the state,</p>
<p>and as a consequence, we set America on a path where, in my view, regulation always</p>
<p>leads to more regulation, there&rsquo;s never a case where regulation decreases, and we started</p>
<p>out with a certain regulatory body around banks, and a recognition that it was okay</p>
<p>to regulate the economy, so once we get into the late 19th century, it&rsquo;s fine to regulate</p>
<p>the railroads, it&rsquo;s fine to pass antitrust laws, it&rsquo;s fine to then continue on the path</p>
<p>of where we are today, which is heavy, heavy, heavy, massive involvement of government in</p>
<p>every aspect of our economy, and really in every aspect of our life, because of education.</p>
<p>So I think the country was founded on certain mistakes, and we haven&rsquo;t been willing to</p>
<p>question those mistakes, and in a sense that we&rsquo;ve only moved in the opposite direction,</p>
<p>and now America&rsquo;s become, whereas I think it was founded on the idea of the primacy</p>
<p>of the individual, the sanctity of the individual, at least as an idea, even if not fully implemented,</p>
<p>I think now that&rsquo;s completely lost, I don&rsquo;t think anybody really is an advocate out there</p>
<p>for individualism in politics, or for true freedom in politics.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get to individualism, but let me ask the Beatles and the Rolling Stones question</p>
<p>about the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.</p>
<p>Rolling Stones.</p>
<p>Well, because it&rsquo;s like which document, Beatles or Rolling Stones, which document is more</p>
<p>important?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obviously the Beatles, right?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Is there a question here?</p>
<p>Is there even a question?</p>
<p>But let me then even zoom in further and ask you to pick your favorite song.</p>
<p>So what ideas in the Constitution or the Declaration of Independence do you think are the most</p>
<p>important to the success of the United States of America?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll answer the question, but before answering the question, I want to register a dissent</p>
<p>from your own.</p>
<p>Is it the public education?</p>
<p>Is it which?</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Actually, look, we&rsquo;re not so far apart on public education.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually kind of surprised that you&rsquo;re so anti Bismarck because his public school</p>
<p>system, his national public school system was created in order to stick it to the church.</p>
<p>It was the church that ran the schools before then, and so that&rsquo;s a different&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all for sticking it to the church, any opportunity, but not when the alternative</p>
<p>is the nation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather see a free educational system where freedom is in education.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I want to register a dissent about Lincoln.</p>
<p>Look, Lincoln is an important figure and a great man, and he was presiding over a country,</p>
<p>which at that point was pretty Jeffersonian in terms of its self perception.</p>
<p>He said what he needed to say.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to criticize him, but I don&rsquo;t accept the idea that the Declaration of Independence,</p>
<p>which starts one revolution, is of a piece with the second constitution, the constitution</p>
<p>of 1787, the nationalist constitution, which is effectively a counter revolution.</p>
<p>What happens is there is a revolution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s based on certain principles.</p>
<p>There are a lot&hellip;</p>
<p>Not exactly, but in many ways resembles the later ideas of the French Revolution.</p>
<p>And what the Federalist Party does, the Nationalist Conservative Party does, is a counter revolution</p>
<p>to reinstate the Old English Constitution.</p>
<p>So these documents are, if you&rsquo;re willing to accept the evidence of history, they are</p>
<p>in many respects contrary to one another.</p>
<p>And so if I&rsquo;m asked what&rsquo;s the most important values that are handed down by these documents,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have an objection to life, liberty, and property, all of which are really important</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>I do have an objection to the pompous overreach of these are self evident, which is absurd.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t be self evident.</p>
<p>If they were self evident, then somebody would have come up with them like 2,000 years before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not self evident.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s damaging.</p>
<p>I like the conservative preamble of the constitution, which describes the purposes of the national</p>
<p>government that&rsquo;s being established.</p>
<p>There are seven purposes, a more perfect union, which is the principle of cohesion, justice,</p>
<p>domestic peace, common defense, the general welfare, which is the welfare of the public</p>
<p>as a thing that&rsquo;s not only individuals, but there is such a thing as a general welfare,</p>
<p>liberty, which we agree is absolutely crucial, and posterity, the idea that the purpose of</p>
<p>the government is to be able to sustain and grow this independent nation, and not only</p>
<p>to guarantee rights no matter what happens.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t like the, we hold these truths to be self evident, so you&rsquo;re definitely a Beatles</p>
<p>guy.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want the pompous, you don&rsquo;t need that revolutionary strength.</p>
<p>Look, I think that that expression, self evident truths, it does tremendous damage because instead</p>
<p>of a moderate skepticism, which says, look, we may not know everything, it says, look,</p>
<p>we know everything.</p>
<p>Here it is.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what we know.</p>
<p>We know.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what we think.</p>
<p>So, you know, I&rsquo;ll agree with you all.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like self evident.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like self evident because he&rsquo;s absolutely right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not self evident.</p>
<p>These are massive achievements.</p>
<p>These are massive achievements of enlightened thinking, of studying history, of understanding</p>
<p>human nature, of deriving a truth from 3,000 years of historical knowledge and a better</p>
<p>understanding of human nature and a capacity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s using reason in some ways better than any human beings have.</p>
<p>I mean, the founding fathers are giants historically, in my view, because they came up with these</p>
<p>truths.</p>
<p>I do think they&rsquo;re truths, but they&rsquo;re certainly not self evident.</p>
<p>I mean, if they were, your arm is right.</p>
<p>They would have discovered them thousands of years earlier or everybody would accept</p>
<p>them, right?</p>
<p>I mean, how many people today think that those, what they state in that document is true?</p>
<p>Pretty much, you know, five people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, it&rsquo;s very, your criticism of modern society, yes, we&rsquo;ll get there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very few people recognize that if they were self evident, bam, everybody</p>
<p>would have become, you know, would have accepted the American Revolution as truth and that</p>
<p>was it.</p>
<p>A lot of work has to go into understanding and describing and convincing people about</p>
<p>those truths.</p>
<p>But I completely disagree with your arm about this idea or I&rsquo;ll voice my dissent, as we</p>
<p>said.</p>
<p>I disagree with your official dissent.</p>
<p>About A, that this being two different revolutions and B, that the American Revolution had any</p>
<p>similarity to the French Revolution.</p>
<p>You know that Jefferson and Payne, they were in France running a different revolution.</p>
<p>I know, but they were waiting constantly.</p>
<p>I mean, they were in communication with Madison, there was a lot of input going on.</p>
<p>I know, and Jefferson&rsquo;s sitting there in Paris pulling his hair out because Madison has come</p>
<p>under the influence of these nationalists and he can&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>The reality is that the difference between the French Revolution and the American Revolution</p>
<p>is vast and it is a deep philosophical difference and it&rsquo;s a difference that expressed, I think,</p>
<p>between the differences.</p>
<p>You know, Joram, in his writings, lumps Rousseau with Locke and with Voltaire and with others</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>I think Rousseau is very different than the others.</p>
<p>I think, again, Rousseau is an anti enlightenment figure, Rousseau is in many respects hearkening</p>
<p>back to a past, an ancient past and I think a completely distorted view of human nature,</p>
<p>of human mind.</p>
<p>He rejects reason.</p>
<p>I mean, Rousseau is on the premise that reason is the end of humanity, reason is the destruction</p>
<p>of humanity, reason is how we get civilization and civilization is awful because ‚Äì</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t disagree.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re only talking about different texts.</p>
<p>When I say Rousseau, I&rsquo;m just talking about the social contract.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the social contract, there&rsquo;s similarity between others, but he takes it in a completely</p>
<p>different direction and we agree social contract is a bad idea, but you can&rsquo;t have a contract</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t actually voluntarily accept, but Rousseau is the French Revolution.</p>
<p>Rousseau is about destruction and mayhem and chaos and anarchy.</p>
<p>He is the spirit behind the French Revolution.</p>
<p>I think the American Revolution is a complete rejection of Rousseau.</p>
<p>I think Jefferson is a complete rejection of Rousseau.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Jefferson is a fan of Rousseau.</p>
<p>He is of Voltaire and he certainly is of Montesquieu.</p>
<p>If you look at the Federalist Papers, the intellectual most cited in the Federalist</p>
<p>Papers I think in terms of just the number of times it&rsquo;s cited is Montesquieu.</p>
<p>So I think that the American Revolution is an individualistic revolution.</p>
<p>It is a revolution about the rights of the individual.</p>
<p>The French Revolution is a negation of the rights of the individual.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a collectivistic revolution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not quite the Marxist revolution of the proletarian, but it&rsquo;s defining people in classes</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a rebellion against a certain class and yeah, kill them all, right?</p>
<p>Off with their heads.</p>
<p>It is a negation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about egalitarianism in the sense of equality of outcome, not in a sense of equality</p>
<p>before the law or equality of rights, which is the Jeffersonian sense.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s wrong to lump Jefferson in to the fraternity egalitarian notion of the French,</p>
<p>which is far more similar to what ultimately became socialism and Marxism and that tradition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s anti individualistic, the French Revolution is, whereas the American Revolution, the first</p>
<p>one, is individualistic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about individual rights and while there&rsquo;s certain phrases in the Declaration</p>
<p>of Independence that I don&rsquo;t agree with, it&rsquo;s beautifully written and it&rsquo;s a magnificent</p>
<p>document, so it&rsquo;s hard for me to say I don&rsquo;t agree, but who am I?</p>
<p>These were giants, self evident is one of them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not particularly crazy about Endowed by the Creator, but I like the fact that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>creator and not God or not a specific creator, but just a more general thing.</p>
<p>But putting those two ashes aside, it&rsquo;s the greatest political document in all of human</p>
<p>history in my view by far.</p>
<p>Nothing comes close.</p>
<p>It is a document that identifies the core principles of political truism, of truth.</p>
<p>That is, the role of government is to preserve and to protect these rights, these inalienable</p>
<p>rights and that is so crucial that these rights are inalienable.</p>
<p>That is, a majority can&rsquo;t vote them out, a revelation can&rsquo;t vote them out.</p>
<p>This is what is required for human liberty and human freedom, the right that is the sanction,</p>
<p>the freedom to act on your own behalf, to act based on your own judgment and as long</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re not interfering with other people&rsquo;s rights, you are free to do so.</p>
<p>That is such a profound truth and that to me is the essence of political philosophy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the beginning and it&rsquo;s based on, just not to fall into, Yolam&rsquo;s going to say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a rationalist, it&rsquo;s based on a whole history of what happens when we negate that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s based on looking at England and seeing to the extent that they practiced a respect</p>
<p>for individual liberty, of property, of freedom, good things happened.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take that all the way.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not compromise on that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be consistent with the good and reject the bad and when England goes away, distance</p>
<p>itself from the rights of man, from the idea of a right to property and so on, bad things</p>
<p>happen and when they go to it, let&rsquo;s go all in and I&rsquo;m all in on the right to life, liberty,</p>
<p>property and the pursuit of happiness.</p>
<p>And I think the idea of pursuit of happiness is profound because it&rsquo;s a moral statement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a statement that says that sanctions and says that ultimately people should be</p>
<p>allowed to make their own judgments and live their lives as they see fit based on how they</p>
<p>view happiness.</p>
<p>They might be right, they might be wrong, but we&rsquo;re not going to dictate what happiness</p>
<p>entails and dictate to people how they should live their lives.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to let them figure that out.</p>
<p>So it has this self interested moral code kind of embedded in it.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s a beautiful statement.</p>
<p>So I think the declaration is key and I think there was an experiment.</p>
<p>An experiment was proposed in that period before the Constitution where the experiment</p>
<p>was let&rsquo;s let the states, let&rsquo;s have a kind of a loose confederation, let&rsquo;s let the states</p>
<p>experiment with setting up their own constitutions and rule of government and we won&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>kind of unity.</p>
<p>And I think what they realized, and I think even Jefferson realized, is that that was</p>
<p>not workable because many of the states were starting to significantly violate rights.</p>
<p>There was nothing to unify, there was nothing to really protect the vision of the declaration.</p>
<p>You needed to establish a nation, which is what the Constitution does, it establishes</p>
<p>a nation.</p>
<p>But the purpose of that was to put everybody under one set of laws that protected rights.</p>
<p>The focus was still on the protection of rights and I agree with six of the seven of the principles.</p>
<p>Which did this group?</p>
<p>The common welfare, the general welfare, which I&rsquo;m worried about, right?</p>
<p>I think in the way the founders understood it, I think I probably agreed with it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s such an ambiguous‚Äî</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you don&rsquo;t agree.</p>
<p>Maybe I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Can you state the general welfare principle?</p>
<p>Well the idea that part of the role of government is to secure the general welfare is something‚Äî</p>
<p>This is something we didn&rsquo;t get to in the debate, we really should have, is the question</p>
<p>of whether there is such a thing as a common good or a public interest or a national interest</p>
<p>or a general welfare, do these words, do these terms mean anything other than the good of</p>
<p>all of the individuals in the country?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an important‚Äî</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s right, so that&rsquo;s why I object to it because I think it&rsquo;s too easy</p>
<p>to interpret it as.</p>
<p>So I interpret it as, well, what&rsquo;s good for a general, a group, a common people, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a good collection of individuals, so what&rsquo;s good for the individual is good for the common</p>
<p>welfare, but I understand that that&rsquo;s something that is hard for people to grasp and not the</p>
<p>common understanding.</p>
<p>So I would have skipped the general welfare in order to avoid the fact that now the general</p>
<p>welfare includes the government telling you what gender you should be assigned, so I would</p>
<p>have wanted to have skipped that completely.</p>
<p>So I think the Constitution is completely consistent with the Declaration with a few</p>
<p>exceptions of general welfare, but perfection is a difficult thing to find, particularly</p>
<p>for me politically, but it&rsquo;s a magnificent document, the Constitution.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t quite rise to the level, I think, of the Declaration, but it&rsquo;s a magnificent</p>
<p>document because‚Äîand this is the difference, I think, between the English Constitution.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I see as the difference.</p>
<p>The difference is that the Constitution is written in the context of why do we have a</p>
<p>separation of powers, for example?</p>
<p>We have a separation of powers in order to make sure that the government only does what</p>
<p>the government is supposed to do, and what is the government supposed to do?</p>
<p>Well, fundamentally, it&rsquo;s supposed to protect rights.</p>
<p>I mean, all of those seven, or at least six of the seven, are about protecting rights.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re about protecting us from foreign invaders.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re about protecting peace within the country.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re about preserving this protection of rights, and why do we have this separation</p>
<p>so that we make sure that no one of those entities, the executive or the legislature,</p>
<p>the judicial, can violate rights because there&rsquo;s always somebody looking over their shoulder.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always somebody who can veto their power, but there&rsquo;s a purpose to it, and that</p>
<p>purpose is clearly signified and characterized, and that&rsquo;s why I think the Bill of Rights</p>
<p>was written, in order to add to the clarification of what exactly we mean.</p>
<p>What is the purpose?</p>
<p>The purpose is to preserve rights, and that&rsquo;s why we need to elaborate what those rights</p>
<p>are.</p>
<p>And Madison&rsquo;s objection to the Bill of Rights was to say not that he objected to having</p>
<p>protection of rights, but to listing them because he was worried that other rights that</p>
<p>were not listed would not be, and his worry was completely justified because it&rsquo;s exactly</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happened.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, the only reason we have free speech in America is because we&rsquo;ve got it in writing</p>
<p>as a First Amendment.</p>
<p>If we didn&rsquo;t have it in writing, it would have been gone a long time ago, and the reason</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have, for example, the freedom to negotiate a contract, you know, independent</p>
<p>government regulation, that was not listed as a right in the Bill, even though I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s clearly covered under the Constitution and certainly under the Declaration.</p>
<p>So there was a massive mistake done in the Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>They tried to cover it with the Ninth Amendment, but it never really stuck, this idea that</p>
<p>nonenumerated rights that are still in place.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t see it as a second revolution.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a fix to a flaw that happened.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fix that allowed the expansion of the protection of rights to all states by creating</p>
<p>a national entity to protect those rights, and that&rsquo;s what ultimately led to slavery</p>
<p>going away.</p>
<p>You know, under the initial agreement, slavery would have been there in perpetuity because</p>
<p>states were sovereign in a way that under the new Constitution they were not, and in</p>
<p>a sense, the Constitution sets in motion, the Declaration and then the Constitution</p>
<p>set in motion, the Civil War.</p>
<p>The Civil War has to happen because at the end of the day, you cannot have some states</p>
<p>with a massive violation of rights, what&rsquo;s more of a violation of rights than slavery,</p>
<p>and some states that recognize it&rsquo;s not, it inevitably leads to the Civil War.</p>
<p>Yaron was just saying that, you know, other than the general welfare, these principles</p>
<p>are about individual liberties.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t think you can read it that way.</p>
<p>The first stated purpose of the Constitution of 1787 is in order to form a more perfect</p>
<p>union.</p>
<p>A more perfect union, it&rsquo;s describing a characteristic of the whole, it is not a characteristic of</p>
<p>any individual.</p>
<p>If you look at how the individuals are doing, you don&rsquo;t know whether their union is more</p>
<p>or less perfect.</p>
<p>So what they&rsquo;re doing is they&rsquo;re looking at the condition in which in order to be able</p>
<p>to fight the battle of Yorktown, somebody has to write a personal check in order to</p>
<p>be able to move armies.</p>
<p>A more perfect union is a more cohesive union, it&rsquo;s the ability to get all of these different</p>
<p>individuals to do one focused thing when it&rsquo;s necessary to do it.</p>
<p>Well it&rsquo;s more than that, right, so I agree with that, but for what purpose?</p>
<p>That is, and this is why, you know, this is why it&rsquo;s so hard with these historical documents</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a context and there&rsquo;s a thinking that they can&rsquo;t write everything down, right,</p>
<p>which is sad because I wish they had.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the purpose of a more perfect union?</p>
<p>The purpose of the more perfect union is to preserve the liberty of the individuals within</p>
<p>that union.</p>
<p>Well how do you know?</p>
<p>Because if you look, what&rsquo;s the rest?</p>
<p>So what is the common defense?</p>
<p>The common defense is to protect us from foreign invaders who would now disrupt what the rest</p>
<p>of the Constitution is all about.</p>
<p>All of the Constitution is written in a way as to preserve, find ways to limit the ability</p>
<p>of government to violate the rights of individuals.</p>
<p>The beauty of this Constitution, and again, it&rsquo;s connection to the Declaration and tradition,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>What came before it?</p>
<p>What came before it was a document, which they all respected, which was the Declaration,</p>
<p>which set the context for this.</p>
<p>And now the union is there in order to provide for the common defense, great, because we</p>
<p>know that foreign invaders can violate our rights, that&rsquo;s what war is about.</p>
<p>To protect us from peace, to establish peace and justice within the country, that&rsquo;s based</p>
<p>on law, the rule of law, and again, individual liberty.</p>
<p>So to me, when you read the Founders, when you read the Federalist Papers, when you read</p>
<p>what they wrote, what they&rsquo;re trying to do is figure out the right kind of political</p>
<p>system, the right kind of structure to be able to preserve these liberties, and not</p>
<p>all of them had, from my perspective, a perfect understanding of what those liberties entailed,</p>
<p>but they were all, even the conservatives that you call conservatives, were all in generally</p>
<p>in agreement about the importance of individual liberty and the importance of individual liberty.</p>
<p>Of course, because almost all of these rights are traditional English rights, they exist</p>
<p>in the English Bill of Rights, in the English Petition of Rights, they exist in force.</p>
<p>All of these are traditional.</p>
<p>And what they&rsquo;re trying to do is perfect that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to take the British system and perfect it.</p>
<p>But you keep leaving out that they want to be like England in that they want to have</p>
<p>an independent nation.</p>
<p>An independent nation is not a collection of individual liberties.</p>
<p>An independent nation, the first sentence of the Declaration of Independence is the</p>
<p>declaration that there is a collective right, that we as a people are breaking the bonds</p>
<p>with another people, and we&rsquo;re going to take our place, our equal station, among the nations</p>
<p>of the earth.</p>
<p>But for what purpose?</p>
<p>The purpose is to protect individual rights.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no collective right.</p>
<p>Your argument is completely circular.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not allowing the possibility that there could be great and decent men that you and</p>
<p>I both admire who wanted the independence of their nation, not because that would give</p>
<p>individuals liberty, but because the independence of their nation was itself a great good.</p>
<p>So we clearly disagree on this, because I don&rsquo;t think the independence of the nation</p>
<p>is a good in and of itself, because it&rsquo;s ‚Äì</p>
<p>But did they think it was?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they did.</p>
<p>And this is why they tried so hard not to break from England, and why many of them struggled,</p>
<p>really, really struggled with having a revolution, because England was pretty good, right?</p>
<p>England was the best.</p>
<p>And this is where we should get to the universality of these things, because I do think England</p>
<p>was the best, and universally and absolutely was the best system out there.</p>
<p>And they struggled to break from England, because they didn&rsquo;t view the value of having</p>
<p>a nation as the primary.</p>
<p>But what they identified in England is certain flaws in the system that created situations</p>
<p>in which their rights were being violated.</p>
<p>So they figured the only option in order to secure these rights is to break away from</p>
<p>England and secure a nation.</p>
<p>Now, I am not an anarchist, as Michael Malice is, because we&rsquo;ve discussed it.</p>
<p>I believe you need nations.</p>
<p>You need nations to secure those rights.</p>
<p>That is, the rights are not ‚Äì you can&rsquo;t secure those rights without having a nation.</p>
<p>But the nation is just a means to an end.</p>
<p>The end is the rights, and I think that&rsquo;s how the founders understood it, and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why they created this kind of country.</p>
<p>I think this is a good place to ask about common welfare and cohesion.</p>
<p>Let me say what John Donne wrote that, quote, no man is an island entire of itself.</p>
<p>Every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main.</p>
<p>He went on, any man&rsquo;s death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and therefore</p>
<p>never sent to know for whom the bell tolls.</p>
<p>It tolls for thee.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about individualism and cohesion, not just at the political level, but at a</p>
<p>philosophical level for the human condition.</p>
<p>What is central?</p>
<p>What is the role of other humans in our lives?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the importance of cohesion?</p>
<p>This is something you&rsquo;ve talked about.</p>
<p>So Aaron said that the beauty of the founding documents is that they create a cohesive union</p>
<p>that protects the individual freedoms, but you have spoken about the value of the union,</p>
<p>the common welfare, the cohesion in itself.</p>
<p>So can you maybe elaborate on what is the role of cohesion and the collective, not to</p>
<p>use that term, but multiple humans together connected in the human condition?</p>
<p>Sure, I keep getting the feeling that Yaron and I are actually having a disagreement about</p>
<p>empirical reality, because I think that enlightenment rationalist political thought features the</p>
<p>individual, it features the state.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t really a nation other than the nation, the people as a collective is created</p>
<p>by the state, and when the state disappears, then the collective disappears.</p>
<p>Now, I think that when conservatives of all stripes look at this kind of thinking, that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the individuals and then there&rsquo;s the state, and there really isn&rsquo;t anything else.</p>
<p>When they look at that, they say, even before you get to consequences, it&rsquo;s a terrible theory</p>
<p>because when we try to understand any field of inquiry, any domain, any subject area,</p>
<p>when you try to understand it, we try to come up with a small number of concepts and of</p>
<p>relations among the concepts, which is supposed to be able to explain, to illuminate as much</p>
<p>as possible the important things that are taking place in the domain.</p>
<p>And conservatives look at this, individuals and the state, and they say, you&rsquo;re missing</p>
<p>most of what&rsquo;s going on in politics, also in personal human relations as well.</p>
<p>But it just doesn&rsquo;t look like a description of human beings, it looks like a completely</p>
<p>artificial thing.</p>
<p>And then conservatives say, well, look, once you adopt this artificial thing, then the</p>
<p>consequences are horrific because you&rsquo;re not describing reality.</p>
<p>So a conservative reality begins with an empirical view of what are human beings like, and the</p>
<p>first thing you notice about human beings, or at least the first thing I think conservatives</p>
<p>notice is that they&rsquo;re sticky, is that they clump, they turn into groups.</p>
<p>And you take any arbitrary collection of human beings and set them to a task, or even just</p>
<p>leave them alone, and they quickly form into groups and those groups are always structured</p>
<p>as hierarchies.</p>
<p>This is this competition within the hierarchy, who&rsquo;s going to be the leader, who&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be number two.</p>
<p>But everywhere you look in human societies, universally, there are groups, the groups</p>
<p>compete and they&rsquo;re structured internally as hierarchies, and then there are internal</p>
<p>competitions for who leads the different groups.</p>
<p>And when we think about scientific explanation, we allow that there are different levels of</p>
<p>explanation that a macroscopic object like a table, it doesn&rsquo;t have properties that can</p>
<p>be directly derived from the properties of the atoms or the molecules or the microfibers</p>
<p>that make up the table.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s understood, that there&rsquo;s what academic philosophers call emergent properties,</p>
<p>that when you get up to the level of the table, it has properties like that you can&rsquo;t put</p>
<p>your fist through it, which you can&rsquo;t necessarily know just by looking at the atoms alone.</p>
<p>And I think conservatives say the same thing is true for political theory, for social theory,</p>
<p>that looking at an individual human being and thinking about what does that individual</p>
<p>human being need, which Jeroen does very eloquently in his writings.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t tell you what the characteristics are of this hierarchically structured group.</p>
<p>As soon as you have that, it has its own qualities.</p>
<p>So an example, the question of what holds these groups together, and we need to answer</p>
<p>that question.</p>
<p>I try to answer it by saying there&rsquo;s such a thing as mutual loyalty.</p>
<p>Mutual loyalty is shorthand for human beings, individuals have the capacity to include another</p>
<p>individual within their self, within their conception of their self.</p>
<p>When two people do it, it creates a bond, like a bond between two atoms creates a molecule.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that they lose their individuality.</p>
<p>Within the group, they may still continue competing with one another.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that there isn&rsquo;t, in reality, a bond, and that real bond is the</p>
<p>stuff of which political events and political history are made, is the coming together,</p>
<p>the cohesion and the dissolution of these bonded loyalty groups.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reality of politics.</p>
<p>And so when I hear these discussions about individuals in the state, I feel like we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>missing most of the reality, and in order to understand the political reality, we need</p>
<p>to understand what makes human beings coherent to groups, what makes them dissolve, what</p>
<p>makes the groups come apart and end up creating civil wars and that kind of thing.</p>
<p>I think we also need to know, in practice, rival groups do come together and bond.</p>
<p>I mean, basically, when we think about democratic society, we&rsquo;re talking about different groups,</p>
<p>we can call them tribes, or you can come up with a different name, but different tribal</p>
<p>groupings with different views, they come together to form a nation, and they&rsquo;re able</p>
<p>to do that, even though often they hate each other, like we were talking about the American</p>
<p>Revolution, and often they hate each other, and nevertheless, they&rsquo;re able to come together.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>And that leads us into questions like, how does honor, the giving of honor by one group</p>
<p>to another, how does that increase the mutual loyalty between groups that are still competing</p>
<p>with one another?</p>
<p>All of these questions, I think we have to answer them in order to be able to talk about</p>
<p>politics.</p>
<p>And I think the reason, the first reason why one should approach politics as a conservative</p>
<p>rather than as an individualist is because it gives us these theoretical tools to be</p>
<p>able to talk about reality, which we don&rsquo;t have as long as we keep within the individualist</p>
<p>framework.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;re talking, the metaphor that&rsquo;s popping up into my mind, and this is also something</p>
<p>that bothers me with theoretical physics, the metaphor is there&rsquo;s some sense in which</p>
<p>this thing&rsquo;s called theories of everything, where you try to describe the basic laws of</p>
<p>physics, how they interact together, and once you do, you have a sense that you understand</p>
<p>all of reality.</p>
<p>In a sense, you do.</p>
<p>And that to me, that to me is understanding the individual, like how the individual behaves</p>
<p>in this world.</p>
<p>But then you&rsquo;re saying that they&rsquo;re, hey, hey, you&rsquo;re also forgetting chemistry, biology,</p>
<p>how all of that actually comes together, the stickiness, the stickiness of molecules and</p>
<p>how they build different systems and they, some systems can kill each other, some systems</p>
<p>can flourish, some can make pancakes and bananas and some can make poison and all those kinds</p>
<p>of things that we need to be able to, we need to consider the full stack of things that</p>
<p>are constructed from the fundamental basics.</p>
<p>And I guess, Yaron, you&rsquo;re saying that, no, you&rsquo;re just like the theoretical physicist,</p>
<p>it all starts at the bottom, like if you need to preserve the fundamentals of reality, which</p>
<p>is the individual, like the basic atom of human society is the individual, do you?</p>
<p>So yes, so the basic unit, the basic moral unit, the basic ethical unit in society is</p>
<p>the individual.</p>
<p>And yeah, of course we form groups and you can&rsquo;t understand history unless you understand</p>
<p>group formation and group motivation and I have a view about what kind of groups should</p>
<p>be formed and politically, from a political perspective, voluntary ones, ones in which</p>
<p>we join when we want to join and we can leave when we want to leave and ones that help us</p>
<p>and clearly groups help us pursue whatever it is a goal is ultimately.</p>
<p>So in the pursuit of happiness, there are lots of groups that one wants to form, whether</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s marriage, whether it&rsquo;s businesses, whether it&rsquo;s sports teams, there are lots of different</p>
<p>groups one wants to form, but the question is what is the standard of well being?</p>
<p>Is it the standard of well being some algorithm that maximizes the well being of a group,</p>
<p>some utilitarian function?</p>
<p>Is it something that&rsquo;s inherent in the group that we can measure as goodness and to help</p>
<p>with individuals within as long as we can get the group to function well, we don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>care about where the individuals are.</p>
<p>So to me, the goal of creating groups is the well being of the individual and that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>it needs to be voluntary and that&rsquo;s why there has to be a way out of those.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s costly, it&rsquo;s not a cheap out, that&rsquo;s why you should really think about what</p>
<p>groups you and this on an issue that&rsquo;s very controversial, maybe we can discuss, maybe</p>
<p>not.</p>
<p>To me, immigration is so important, open immigration or free immigration is because that&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>group that I would like people to be able to voluntarily choose both in and out and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to see people be able to go and join that group that they believe will allow for</p>
<p>the pursuit of happiness.</p>
<p>But let me say that that&rsquo;s a description of an ideal, what I&rsquo;m just saying.</p>
<p>I recognize that that&rsquo;s not the reality in which we live.</p>
<p>I recognize that that&rsquo;s not the reality in which history.</p>
<p>Recognizing that the individual exists in a sense, philosophically, is a massive achievement.</p>
<p>Human beings, however they evolved, clearly we started out in a tribal context in which</p>
<p>the individual didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>We followed the leader, the competition was for power, power over the group and dictates</p>
<p>how the group should work.</p>
<p>The history of human beings is a history of gaining knowledge and part of the knowledge</p>
<p>is the value of an individual.</p>
<p>You can see that in religion, you can see that in philosophy, you can see that through</p>
<p>the evolution.</p>
<p>We evolved from tribes into nations and then empires and conflicts between nations and</p>
<p>conflicts between empires.</p>
<p>We tried a lot of different things, if you will.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we always did it on purpose, but different philosophies, different sets</p>
<p>of ideas drove us towards different collectives, different groupings, and different ways in</p>
<p>which to structure.</p>
<p>After 3,000 years of known history, there&rsquo;s history before that, but we don&rsquo;t know much</p>
<p>about it, 3,000 years of known history, you can sit back and evaluate.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what is done in the Enlightenment.</p>
<p>You sit back, and certainly we can do it today, we can sit back and evaluate.</p>
<p>What promotes human flourishing and what doesn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>What do we mean by human flourishing?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s flourishing?</p>
<p>Well, individual human beings.</p>
<p>Now, since I don&rsquo;t believe in a zero sum world, and the world is not zero sum, we can see</p>
<p>that, it&rsquo;s empirically possible to show that the world is not a zero sum game, my flourishing</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t come at your expense, so I can show that a system that promotes my flourishing</p>
<p>probably promotes your flourishing as well and promotes the general welfare in that sense</p>
<p>because it promotes individuals flourishing, and we can look at all these examples of how</p>
<p>we evolved and what leads to bloodshed and what doesn&rsquo;t and what promotes this ability</p>
<p>to flourish as an individual, again, an achievement, the idea of individual flourishing, and then</p>
<p>we can think about how to create a political system around that, a political system that</p>
<p>recognizes and allows for the formation of groups, but just under the principle of voluntary.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t be forced to join a group, you can&rsquo;t be coerced into forming a group other than</p>
<p>the fact that you&rsquo;re born in a particular place, in a particular, you know, that in</p>
<p>a sense, but that&rsquo;s not forced, there&rsquo;s a difference between metaphysics and between</p>
<p>choices.</p>
<p>So this is something that came up in the debate that Yoram said that not all human relations</p>
<p>are voluntary, and you kind of emphasized that a lot of where we are is not voluntary.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re grounded, we&rsquo;re connected in so much.</p>
<p>So how can a human be free in the way you&rsquo;re describing, individual be free if some part</p>
<p>of who we are is not voluntary, some part of who we are is other people?</p>
<p>Well because what do we mean by freedom?</p>
<p>Freedom doesn&rsquo;t mean the negation of the laws of physics, right?</p>
<p>Freedom doesn&rsquo;t mean ignoring, freedom means the ability within the scope of what&rsquo;s available</p>
<p>for you to choose, being able to choose those things.</p>
<p>So in a political context, freedom means, you know, the absence of coercion.</p>
<p>So once you&rsquo;re an adult, you know, Yoram says you&rsquo;re born into a particular religious</p>
<p>context, absolutely, but once you&rsquo;re an adult, I think it&rsquo;s incumbent on you to evaluate</p>
<p>that religious context and look at different religions or nonreligion or whatever and choose</p>
<p>your philosophy of life, choose your values, choose how you want to live your life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the freedom.</p>
<p>The freedom is, one system says you&rsquo;re either coerced by the state or coerced by the group</p>
<p>or coerced by society around you to follow a particular path, or the expectation is,</p>
<p>the demand is, the pressure is to conform to a particular path, and my view is, no,</p>
<p>you should be in a position to be able to choose your path, and that choice means you</p>
<p>look around, you evaluate, you evaluate based on history, based on knowledge, based on all</p>
<p>of these things, and you choose what that path would be.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fundamentally what freedom means.</p>
<p>Yes, you cannot choose your parents, but of course not.</p>
<p>Nobody would claim that that&rsquo;s within the scope of what is possible.</p>
<p>I think the coercion freedom dichotomy, these are too few concepts, coercion and freedom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too simplistic to be able to describe what we&rsquo;re actually dealing with.</p>
<p>The traditional Anglo conservative view is that society has to be, it has to be ordered,</p>
<p>it has to be disciplined, and there are two choices for how it can be ordered.</p>
<p>One is that a people is, by its own traditions, you would say voluntarily, but these are mostly</p>
<p>inherited traditions, by its own traditions, it is ordered.</p>
<p>For example, people just in general will not go into somebody else&rsquo;s yard, because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the custom here, is we don&rsquo;t go into somebody else&rsquo;s yard without their permission.</p>
<p>Fortescue, we&rsquo;re talking about 500 years ago already, Fortescue says that the genius of</p>
<p>the English people is that our government can be mild and apply very little coercion,</p>
<p>because the people are so disciplined.</p>
<p>When he says the people are so disciplined, what he&rsquo;s saying is that our nation, our tribes,</p>
<p>we have strong traditions which channel people through tools of being honored and dishonored.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a reality that exists in every society, and it&rsquo;s not captured by your distinction</p>
<p>between coercion and lack of coercion.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m going to be dishonored if I don&rsquo;t care for my aging mother, I&rsquo;m not being coerced</p>
<p>like the state comes and puts a gun to my head, but I am being pressured and given guidelines.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying that&rsquo;s wrong, and I&rsquo;m saying that&rsquo;s dangerous, because that could easily be used</p>
<p>for bad traditions.</p>
<p>No, of course it is.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the standard by which we evaluate what a good tradition is and what a bad tradition</p>
<p>is?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the English.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting to the standard too fast.</p>
<p>Wait, wait.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting to the standard too fast.</p>
<p>But first I want to know, factually, is it true that all societies work like this?</p>
<p>Because if it&rsquo;s true that all societies work like this, then saying we should be free from</p>
<p>it is just a fantasy.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>A, I don&rsquo;t think all societies work like this.</p>
<p>I think much of what happened in America post founding in the 19th century didn&rsquo;t work like</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the genius of America, and I think what happened during the 19th century</p>
<p>in the Industrial Revolution, what happened in the 19th century to some extent globally</p>
<p>but certainly in the United States didn&rsquo;t work that way.</p>
<p>It broke tradition.</p>
<p>I think all innovation breaks tradition, and I think that&rsquo;s what the genius of this country</p>
<p>is and the post enlightenment world is.</p>
<p>I think pre that tradition, they work that way.</p>
<p>And then the question is, do people understand why they do what they do?</p>
<p>That is, I don&rsquo;t want people doing what I think is right just because I think it&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve created a society in which somebody founded this country in a particular way,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re just going to follow.</p>
<p>I want people to understand what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So I want people to have a respect for property, not because it&rsquo;s a tradition, but because</p>
<p>they understand the value of a respect for property.</p>
<p>I want people not to murder one another, not because there&rsquo;s a commandment, thou shall</p>
<p>not murder, but because they have an understanding of why murdering is bad and wrong and bad</p>
<p>for them and bad for the kind of world that they want to live in.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what we achieve through enlightenment, through education, and where</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t treat people just as a blob, a tribe that just follows orders, but we now treat</p>
<p>individuals as capable of thinking for themselves, capable for discovering truth, capable of</p>
<p>figuring out their own values, and that&rsquo;s the big break between.</p>
<p>And this is the break, I think, that the Declaration represents, the break between society that</p>
<p>is based on tradition, following commandments, following rules, because they are the rules,</p>
<p>because they are the commandments, and a society where individuals understand those rules,</p>
<p>understand.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s now become a tradition, let&rsquo;s say, to respect individual rights, to respect</p>
<p>property rights, but they&rsquo;re not following it because it&rsquo;s a tradition.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re following it because they understand what it is about it that makes it good.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the world, I think, that we were on the process of evolving towards, and that</p>
<p>is what got destroyed in the 20th century and has certainly disappeared today.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the great tragedy, is that we&rsquo;re evolving to a place where people understood</p>
<p>the values that represent it.</p>
<p>Of course, the danger with tradition is, I mean, we&rsquo;ll agree, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s okay to kill the Jew, right?</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s okay to steal people&rsquo;s property if they&rsquo;re of a certain color, or it&rsquo;s okay to</p>
<p>enslave.</p>
<p>Those are all traditions.</p>
<p>And yet, once you stop and say, but what are they based on?</p>
<p>Is this right?</p>
<p>Is this just, based on some moral law?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something wrong here.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t achieve happiness and success if we follow these rules.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about reason and tradition, but I think I would love to sort of linger</p>
<p>on the stickiness of humans that you describe.</p>
<p>So you kind of said this primary, the individuals, is primary and that was a great invention.</p>
<p>But to me, it&rsquo;s not at all obvious that somehow, that the invention that humans have been practicing</p>
<p>for a very long time of the stickiness of community, of family, of love, that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>obvious to me, that&rsquo;s not also fundamental to human flourishing and should be celebrated</p>
<p>and protected.</p>
<p>Of course it is.</p>
<p>Now, I suppose the argument you&rsquo;re making is when you start to let the state define</p>
<p>what the stickiness, how the stickiness looks between humans, so you&rsquo;re really like the</p>
<p>voluntary aspect.</p>
<p>But I just want to sort of, the observation is, humans seem to be pretty happy when they</p>
<p>form communities, however you define that.</p>
<p>So romantic partnership, family.</p>
<p>Some communities.</p>
<p>People are miserable in other communities.</p>
<p>So the nature of the community matters, right?</p>
<p>We know this.</p>
<p>We know that some bondings are not healthy and not good for the individuals involved</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t thrive.</p>
<p>So I absolutely, I mean, I&rsquo;m a lover, not a fighter, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge believer in love.</p>
<p>The whole philosophy I think is a love based philosophy.</p>
<p>I fight in order to love, right?</p>
<p>So love is at the core of all of this and it&rsquo;s a love of life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a love of the world out there and it&rsquo;s a love of other people because they represent</p>
<p>a value to you.</p>
<p>So the stickiness is there, it&rsquo;s, you know, my point is A, it should be chosen.</p>
<p>It should be consciously chosen and this is, put aside the state.</p>
<p>Forget the state for a minute.</p>
<p>Forget coercion.</p>
<p>Forget all that.</p>
<p>What I would encourage individuals to do, and this is where, you know, I&rsquo;m not primarily</p>
<p>a political, you know, interested in politics, although I tend to talk most about that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m primarily interested in human beings and how they live in a sense in morality.</p>
<p>And what I would urge individuals to do is to think about their relationships, to choose</p>
<p>the best relationships possible, but to seek out great relationships because other human</p>
<p>beings are an immense value to us.</p>
<p>And you know, when I write, you know, maybe you won&rsquo;t quote this or not, but when I write</p>
<p>that, you know, about the trade of principle and trading, you know, it&rsquo;s easy and obvious</p>
<p>to think of it as a materialistic kind of thing.</p>
<p>You know, I get, you know, I do the chores this day and my wife does the chores the other</p>
<p>day and we&rsquo;re trading.</p>
<p>But trading is much more subtle than that and much more, can be much more spiritual</p>
<p>than that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the trading in emotions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the way one sees each other, it&rsquo;s what one gets from one another.</p>
<p>I think friendship is a form of trade.</p>
<p>Now I know that that seems to make it material, but I don&rsquo;t think of trade as a material</p>
<p>thing.</p>
<p>Friendship is incredibly important in life.</p>
<p>Love is incredibly important in life.</p>
<p>You know, having a group of friends is incredibly important in life.</p>
<p>All of these are sticky and important.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>How can I try to be eloquent on this?</p>
<p>So if you give people freedom, if you give people, well, not politics, relations, relationships.</p>
<p>So this is interesting because we have an interesting dynamic going on here in terms</p>
<p>of beliefs, they&rsquo;re differing and there was interesting overlaps, but there&rsquo;s a worry.</p>
<p>If you look at human history and you study the lessons of history and you look at modern</p>
<p>society, if you give people freedom in terms of stickiness and human relations and so on</p>
<p>full, like if you not give people freedom, emphasize freedom as the highest ideal.</p>
<p>You start getting more tender online dating, the stickiness dissolves just like in chemistry.</p>
<p>You start to have a gas versus a liquid, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the worry.</p>
<p>So you have to study what actually happens.</p>
<p>If you emphasize that the stickiness, the bonds of humans is holding you back, the exercise</p>
<p>of voluntary choice is the highest ideal, the danger of that is for that to be implemented</p>
<p>or interpreted in certain kinds of ways by us flawed humans that are not, I mean, you</p>
<p>could say we&rsquo;re perfectly reasonable and rational, we can think through all of our decisions,</p>
<p>but really, I mean, especially you&rsquo;re young, you get horny, you make decisions that are</p>
<p>suboptimal perhaps.</p>
<p>So the point is you have to look at reality of when you emphasize different things.</p>
<p>So when you talk about what is the ideal life, what is the ideal relations, you have to also</p>
<p>think like, what are you emphasizing?</p>
<p>I think you both agree on what&rsquo;s important, that community can be important, that freedom</p>
<p>is important, but what are you emphasizing and you&rsquo;re really emphasizing the individual</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re emphasizing, Yoram, you&rsquo;re emphasizing more of the community, of the family, of the</p>
<p>stickiness of the nation.</p>
<p>Well, look, I don&rsquo;t want to deny the place of the individual.</p>
<p>I think that there really is a very great change in civilization when the books of Moses</p>
<p>announce that the individual is created in the image of God.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a step that&rsquo;s, as far as we know, without precedent before that in history, and to a</p>
<p>very large degree, I mean, one of the kind of unspoken things going on is that Yoram</p>
<p>and I really do agree on all sorts of things, I think in part because we&rsquo;re both Jewish.</p>
<p>You did say Yoram is basically Moses, yes sir.</p>
<p>No, I said he was channeling Moses, but that&rsquo;s still, in my book, that&rsquo;s still pretty impressive.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s a compliment, I took it as one.</p>
<p>For me, that&rsquo;s a compliment.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about this a little bit just for the listeners, just so they know, Yoram,</p>
<p>amongst many things, we&rsquo;ll talk about the virtue of nationalism, but you&rsquo;re also a religious</p>
<p>scholar of sorts, or at least leverage the Bible for much, not much, but some of the</p>
<p>wisdom in your life.</p>
<p>Look, the way that Yoram looks at enlightenment, or maybe at Ayn Rand, that&rsquo;s the way that</p>
<p>I see the Hebrew scripture and the tradition that comes from it.</p>
<p>It has the same kind of place in my life, and I just, I don&rsquo;t know how much we want</p>
<p>to explore it, but I think that the agreement that we do have about the positive value of</p>
<p>the creative individual, the positive value of the individual&rsquo;s desire to improve the</p>
<p>world, and in my book that means including his or her desire to improve his family, his</p>
<p>tribe, his congregation, his nation, but it still comes from this kind of, what Yoram</p>
<p>calls selfishness, the desire to make things better for yourself.</p>
<p>In Hebrew Bible and in Judaism, that just is a positive thing.</p>
<p>Of course, it can be taken too far, but it just is positive, and it doesn&rsquo;t carry these</p>
<p>kinds of, you should turn the other cheek, you should give away your cloak, you should</p>
<p>love your enemy, these kinds of Christian tropes do not exist in Judaism, and so it</p>
<p>just, I like listening to Yoram, I do feel like he goes too far on various things, but</p>
<p>I also hear underneath it, I can sort of hear the Jewish current and the resistance to things</p>
<p>about Christianity that Jews often find.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ll ask you a question there.</p>
<p>Can you make an argument for turn the other cheek?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I tend to, I guess you would equate that with altruism.</p>
<p>I tend to.</p>
<p>Unjustice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unjust to turn the other cheek.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t love yourself if you&rsquo;re turning the other cheek, it&rsquo;s a lack of love, lack</p>
<p>of self respect.</p>
<p>Well, let me push back on that, because I like turn the other cheek, especially on Twitter.</p>
<p>So I like block the offender on Twitter.</p>
<p>No, so Twitter aside is more like you&rsquo;re investing in the long term version of yourself versus</p>
<p>the short term.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the way I think about it, is like the energy you put onto the world.</p>
<p>The turn the other cheek philosophy allows you to walk through the fire gracefully.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s some sense.</p>
<p>I mean, perhaps you would reframe that as not, then that&rsquo;s not being altruistic or whatever,</p>
<p>but there is something pragmatic about that kind of approach to life.</p>
<p>Disciplining yourself so that you become a better version of yourself.</p>
<p>I mean, not only do we agree, but I think every religious and philosophical tradition</p>
<p>probably has a version of that, even Kant, who we joined together in finding to be terrible.</p>
<p>Even Kant makes that distinction between the short term interest and the long term interest.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s universal.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know of anybody who&rsquo;s really disagreeing about that.</p>
<p>The thing that we were talking about a couple of minutes ago before we got onto this tangent</p>
<p>is the relationship between the individual who is in the image of God and is of value</p>
<p>as an individual.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there&rsquo;s this question about what is good for that person and also what</p>
<p>makes him happy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that those are exactly the same things, but they&rsquo;re both certainly relevant</p>
<p>and important.</p>
<p>And I feel like, I mean, I think we&rsquo;re beginning to uncover this empirical disagreement about</p>
<p>what it is that&rsquo;s good for the individual and what it is that makes them happy.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll go back to something I raised in the debate, which is this theory of Durkheim</p>
<p>that now has been popularized by Jordan Peterson.</p>
<p>Durkheim argues that he&rsquo;s writing a book on suicide, he&rsquo;s trying to understand what</p>
<p>brings individuals to suicide, and he coins this term, anomie, lack of law.</p>
<p>And the argument is that individuals basically are healthy and happy when they find their</p>
<p>place in a hierarchy.</p>
<p>Within a loyalty group in a certain place in a hierarchy, they compete and struggle</p>
<p>in order to rise in the hierarchy, but they know where they are.</p>
<p>They know who they are.</p>
<p>The kids today like to say they know what their identity is because they associate themselves.</p>
<p>Their self expands to take on the leadership, the different layers, the past and the future</p>
<p>of this particular hierarchy.</p>
<p>And I completely agree with you, Ron, that some of these hierarchies are pernicious and</p>
<p>oppressive and terrible, and some of them are better.</p>
<p>What we might disagree about is that you can find human beings who are capable of becoming</p>
<p>healthy and happy off by themselves without participating in this kind of structure.</p>
<p>The minute that you accept, if you accept, that this is empirical reality about human</p>
<p>beings, it&rsquo;s an iron law, you can&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>You can tell human beings that they can be free of all constraints, all you want, and</p>
<p>you can get them to do things that, as you say, they can have contempt for hierarchies.</p>
<p>They can say, I&rsquo;m not going to serve the man, I&rsquo;m just going to burn them all down.</p>
<p>You can get kids to say all of these things.</p>
<p>You can get them either to be Marxists who are actively trying to overthrow and destroy</p>
<p>the existing hierarchies, or you can make them some kind of liberal where they basically</p>
<p>pretend the hierarchies don&rsquo;t exist, they just act like they&rsquo;re not there.</p>
<p>In both cases, and it&rsquo;s not a coincidence that that&rsquo;s what universities teach is your</p>
<p>choice is either Marxist revolution or liberal ignoring of the hierarchies.</p>
<p>In both cases, what you&rsquo;ve done is you&rsquo;ve eliminated the possibility that the young</p>
<p>person will be able to find his or her place in a way that allows them to grow and exercise</p>
<p>their love, their drive, their creativity in order to advance something constructive.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve eliminated it and you&rsquo;ve put the burden on them, a kind of a Nietzschean burden, to</p>
<p>just be the fountain of all values yourself, which maybe some people can do it, but almost</p>
<p>no one can do it.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s empirically true.</p>
<p>And so I think by telling them about their freedom rather than telling them about the</p>
<p>need to join into some traditionalist hierarchy that can be good and healthy for them, I think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re destroying them.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re destroying this generation and the last one and the next.</p>
<p>Yaron, is the burden of freedom destroying mankind?</p>
<p>What freedom?</p>
<p>I mean, how many people are indeed free?</p>
<p>Look, the problem is that we&rsquo;re caught up on political concepts and we&rsquo;re moving into</p>
<p>ethical issues.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s right to tell people, you&rsquo;re free, go do whatever the hell you want.</p>
<p>Just use your emotions.</p>
<p>Just go where you want to go in the spur of the moment.</p>
<p>Think short term.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think long term.</p>
<p>Well, don&rsquo;t think.</p>
<p>Why think?</p>
<p>One has to provide moral guidance and morality here is crucial and crucially important.</p>
<p>And part of taking responsibility for your own life is establishing a moral framework</p>
<p>for your life.</p>
<p>And what does it mean to live a good life?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s much more important in a sense of a question.</p>
<p>And it is my belief that people can do that.</p>
<p>They can find and choose the values necessary to achieve a good life, but they need guidance.</p>
<p>They need guidance.</p>
<p>This is why religion evolved in my view, because people need guidance.</p>
<p>So I had called religion a primitive form of philosophy.</p>
<p>It was the original philosophy that provided people with some guidance about what to do</p>
<p>and what not to do.</p>
<p>And secular philosophy is supposed to do the same.</p>
<p>And the problem is that I think religion and 99% of secular philosophy give people bad</p>
<p>advice about what to do, and therefore they do bad stuff.</p>
<p>And sometimes because when they do good stuff, it gets reinforced, we survive in spite of</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>But ideas like Kant and Hegel and Marx and so on give young people awful advice about</p>
<p>how to live and what to do, and as a consequence, really bad stuff happens.</p>
<p>And the world in which we exist today, which we agree there are a lot of pathologies to</p>
<p>it, a lot of bad stuff going on, in my view is going the wrong way.</p>
<p>In my view, a product of a set of ideas, on the one hand I think Christian ideas, on the</p>
<p>other hand I think secular philosophical ideas that have driven this country and the world</p>
<p>more generally in a really, really bad direction.</p>
<p>And this is why I do what I do, because I think at the core of it, the only way to change</p>
<p>it is not to impose a new set of ideas from the top, because I worry about who&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be doing the imposition.</p>
<p>Plus, I don&rsquo;t believe you can force people to be good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to challenge the ideas, it&rsquo;s to question the ideas, it&rsquo;s to present an alternative</p>
<p>view of morality, an alternative set of moral principles, ultimately an alternative view</p>
<p>of political principles.</p>
<p>But it has to start with morality.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t ‚Äì and my morality is centered on the individual and what the individual</p>
<p>should do with his life in order to attain a good life, I believe that leads to happiness,</p>
<p>the good life, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s good, right?</p>
<p>The goal is survival and thriving and flourishing and happiness, ultimately.</p>
<p>But politics is a servant of that in the end.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an end in itself.</p>
<p>So the real issue is, you know, you asked before what is the value of relationship.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an enormous value in relationship because we get values from other people.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t produce all our values.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t produce all our spiritual values, and we don&rsquo;t produce all our material values.</p>
<p>Other people are a massive benefit to us because they produce values we can&rsquo;t ‚Äì there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a massive division of labor in terms of values, not just in economics, but also in philosophy</p>
<p>and elsewhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why we have teachers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why we have moral teachers.</p>
<p>Moral teachers are important to help guide us towards a good life.</p>
<p>Not all of us are philosophers.</p>
<p>But what I do demand, if you all are individuals ‚Äì this is where I put a burden on people,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Understand what you&rsquo;re doing, right?</p>
<p>You know, don&rsquo;t embrace a moral teaching because it was tradition.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t embrace a moral teaching because your parents embraced it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t embrace a moral teaching just because your teachers are teaching it.</p>
<p>Challenge it.</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<p>Embrace it because you ‚Äì embrace it.</p>
<p>You might be wrong.</p>
<p>You might embrace the wrong one, but take moral responsibility.</p>
<p>Take responsibility over your life by evaluating, testing, challenging what you have received</p>
<p>and choosing what you&rsquo;re going to pursue.</p>
<p>And I acknowledge empirically that most people don&rsquo;t do that, and this is why intellectual</p>
<p>leadership is so important.</p>
<p>This is why you want to get ‚Äì you want the voices in a culture to be good voices so that</p>
<p>those people who don&rsquo;t think for themselves end up being followers, but they end up being</p>
<p>followers of somebody good versus followers of somebody bad.</p>
<p>But for the thinkers in the world out there, who I think are the people who count, who</p>
<p>are the people who shape society ‚Äì</p>
<p>Oh, boy.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Shape society.</p>
<p>Wait a minute.</p>
<p>Not count in a sense that you can dismiss the lives of others and, you know, because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ‚Äì you know, obviously I&rsquo;m anti coercion and anti violence, but ‚Äì</p>
<p>They sound like Plato.</p>
<p>But ‚Äì yes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to sound like Plato.</p>
<p>But in a sense that they&rsquo;re the ones who shape ‚Äì who end up shaping the world.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the ones who end up shaping how the world is.</p>
<p>I want those people to make choices about their values and not to just accept them based</p>
<p>on tradition or based on the commandment or based on where they happen to grow up.</p>
<p>And in that sense, again, you know, I do ‚Äì and this is an interesting point where we disagree,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what Jerome&rsquo;s position is.</p>
<p>I do believe in universal values.</p>
<p>That is, there are things that are good, and there are things that are evil.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;d agree on that.</p>
<p>When there are systems, we agree that communism and fascism are evil.</p>
<p>Well, I think we should be able to agree that some things ‚Äì some political systems are</p>
<p>good.</p>
<p>And maybe there&rsquo;s this middle ground where we both think that they&rsquo;re not particularly</p>
<p>bad but not particularly good, and you all might think they&rsquo;re better than I think</p>
<p>they are.</p>
<p>But if we can agree on this is good and this is evil, right, then the systems that tend</p>
<p>towards the good are good, and the systems that tend towards the evil are evil.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s universal, right?</p>
<p>You know, I look at places like South Korea, Japan, Asia ‚Äì you know, cultures that are</p>
<p>very, very different in many respects in the West.</p>
<p>And yet when they adopt certain Western ideas about freedom, about liberty, about individualism</p>
<p>‚Äì I mean, the Japanese Constitution, because MacArthur forced it in there, has the pursuit</p>
<p>of happiness in the Constitution, not because they chose it because he put it in there.</p>
<p>But they, to some extent, adopted that, and they&rsquo;re successful places today.</p>
<p>Those societies in Asia that didn&rsquo;t adopt these values are not successful societies</p>
<p>today.</p>
<p>Yaron, Japan has a birth rate of, what is it, 1.1, 1.2 children per woman?</p>
<p>I mean, look, there are some things ‚Äì there are some places where you give people freedom</p>
<p>‚Äì this is also biblical, right?</p>
<p>The idea that everyone did what&rsquo;s right in his own eyes, okay?</p>
<p>This is a refrain in the Book of Judges.</p>
<p>And the Bible is not an anti‚Äìfreedom book.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s many, many ‚Äì look, I ‚Äì</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s talk ‚Äì</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re not ‚Äì fine.</p>
<p>Well, we ‚Äì</p>
<p>Oh, we&rsquo;ll get there.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Oh, he&rsquo;s going to guide us.</p>
<p>Okay, look, just as an asterisk, I&rsquo;m not asking you because the Bible is such a great</p>
<p>authoritarian book ‚Äì it&rsquo;s not that at all.</p>
<p>In my view, if you want to know where this ‚Äì what you call the sanctity of property,</p>
<p>where does the sanctity of property comes from?</p>
<p>It comes from the Ten Commandments.</p>
<p>It comes from Moses saying, I haven&rsquo;t taken anything from anyone.</p>
<p>It comes from Samuel saying, I haven&rsquo;t taken anything from anyone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the condemnation of Ahab, of the unjust kings who steal the property of their subjects.</p>
<p>So, property and freedom, I think there&rsquo;s a great basis for it in the Bible.</p>
<p>But right now, I&rsquo;m focusing on this other question, which is what happens when everyone</p>
<p>does what&rsquo;s right in his own eyes?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the Book of Judges, and that&rsquo;s this civil war, moral corruption, theft, idolatry,</p>
<p>murder, rape ‚Äì I mean, that&rsquo;s what happens when everyone does whatever is right in his</p>
<p>own eyes.</p>
<p>Well, no, that&rsquo;s what it says in the text.</p>
<p>Okay, so when I look at ‚Äì you&rsquo;re right, there are things that I think are objectively</p>
<p>true.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really hard to get people to agree to them, almost impossible.</p>
<p>But when I look at a country which is approaching one birth per woman ‚Äì in other words, half</p>
<p>of the minimum necessary for replacement ‚Äì you can say whatever you want.</p>
<p>Whatever you want about immigration, we can have that discussion.</p>
<p>But the point is that when your values are such that you&rsquo;re not even capable of doing</p>
<p>the most basic techniques that human beings need in order to be able to propagate themselves</p>
<p>and their values and the way they see things, then I ‚Äì look, you&rsquo;re finished.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t say that ‚Äì</p>
<p>So if I implied that Japan is an ideal society, I take that back.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s think about Japan for a minute.</p>
<p>I just think we&rsquo;re in trouble, and we&rsquo;re in trouble ‚Äì</p>
<p>I agree with ‚Äì</p>
<p>All right, all right.</p>
<p>Give me a second.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll hold you to that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s being a tutorial.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s his show, man.</p>
<p>It is his show.</p>
<p>We enter into his hierarchy and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>We should talk about hierarchy.</p>
<p>Just to clarify, how do you explain the situation in Japan?</p>
<p>Is it the decrease in value in family, like some of the ‚Äì just expand on that.</p>
<p>How do you explain that situation?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying that that society is in trouble in a certain way.</p>
<p>Can you kind of describe the nature of that trouble?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying that when the individual is part of a social group ‚Äì this can be a family,</p>
<p>a congregation, a community, a tribe, a nation ‚Äì when the individual feels that the things</p>
<p>that are happening to the society are things that are happening to him or to her.</p>
<p>And I want to emphasize, this is not the standard view of collectivism that Mussolini will say,</p>
<p>the glory of the individual is in totally immersing himself in the organic whole.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying that human beings have and are both.</p>
<p>They enter into a society to which they are loyal and they compete with one another in</p>
<p>the terms that that society allows competition, but also sometimes by bending the rules and</p>
<p>by shaping them and by changing them.</p>
<p>What you see in many societies, certainly throughout the liberal West, but also in countries</p>
<p>that have been affected by the liberal West, by industrialization and ideas of individualism,</p>
<p>what you see is a collapse of a willingness of the individual to look at what is needed</p>
<p>by the whole and to make choices that are, as Jorn would call them, selfish because the</p>
<p>purpose of them is self expression, competition, self assertion, moving up in the hierarchy,</p>
<p>achieving honor or wealth in order to do those things.</p>
<p>But when you stop being able to look at the framework of a particular society and identify</p>
<p>with it, you cease to understand what it is that you need to do, not every single person,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m talking about society wide.</p>
<p>So there are a few individuals who are just going to have a fantastic time and live the</p>
<p>kind of life that Jorn is describing, and the great majority, they stop being willing</p>
<p>to take risks.</p>
<p>They stop being willing to get married.</p>
<p>They stop being willing to have children.</p>
<p>They stop being willing to start companies.</p>
<p>They stop being willing to put themselves out to do great things because the guide rails</p>
<p>that told them what kinds of things and the social feedback that honored them when they</p>
<p>did things like getting married and having children, they&rsquo;ve been crushed.</p>
<p>And what have they been crushed by?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been crushed by the false view that if you tell the individual, be free, make</p>
<p>all your own decisions, that they will then be free and make all their own decisions.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They just stop.</p>
<p>They stop being human.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s powerful.</p>
<p>So do you want to respond to that?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think anybody should have children.</p>
<p>If the goal, there&rsquo;s a good tweet clip that you can make.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anybody should have children for the goal of perpetuating their nation</p>
<p>or expanding their society or for some, I think they&rsquo;d make horrible parents if that</p>
<p>was the goal, the purpose of doing it.</p>
<p>I think people should have children because they want to embrace that challenge, that</p>
<p>beauty, that experience, that amazing, very, very hard, very, very difficult experience</p>
<p>in life.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s about being able to project a long term, but also being able to enjoy and love</p>
<p>the creation of another human being, that process of creation.</p>
<p>It is a beautiful, self interested thing.</p>
<p>And by the way, not everybody should have children.</p>
<p>I think way too many people have children.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some awful parents out there that I wish would stop.</p>
<p>I mean, there are.</p>
<p>Life is precious and life of suffering is sad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad to see people suffer and a lot of people are born into situations and are born</p>
<p>into parents that destroy their capacity to ever live a good life.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a tragic and sad thing.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t measure the health of a society in how many children they&rsquo;re having or health</p>
<p>of a couple of whether they have children or not.</p>
<p>Those are individual choices.</p>
<p>Some people make a choice not to have children, which is completely rational and consistent</p>
<p>with their values.</p>
<p>Now when you look at a society overall, I do think having children and not having children</p>
<p>is a reflection of something.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a reflection of a certain optimism about the future.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a reflection of thinking long term versus short term.</p>
<p>I think a short term society doesn&rsquo;t have children.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t have children there because children are a long term investment.</p>
<p>They require real planning and real effort and real thinking about the long term.</p>
<p>But those are moral issues.</p>
<p>And again, we&rsquo;re confusing or mixing.</p>
<p>When I say Japan, look how well Japan has done.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean the specific Japanese people and how many kids they&rsquo;re having and what</p>
<p>kind of life they&rsquo;re having in terms of these kind of particulars.</p>
<p>But think about the alternatives Japan faces if you look around the options that they face.</p>
<p>They tried empire.</p>
<p>They tried nationalistic empire.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t turn out too well for them or anybody who they interacted with.</p>
<p>They could have become North Korea.</p>
<p>We know how that turned out.</p>
<p>We know what that is.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen Cambodia, if you&rsquo;ve ever been to Cambodia and seen the kind of poverty.</p>
<p>And yes, maybe Cambodians have lots of children, but God, I&rsquo;d rather be in Japan any day than</p>
<p>have children in the kind of poverty and horrific circumstances they have.</p>
<p>But in the context of the available regimes that were possible post World War II for the</p>
<p>Japanese to embrace, they embraced one that generally led to prosperity, to freedom, to</p>
<p>individuals pursuing values, not perfectly because they didn&rsquo;t implement the philosophical</p>
<p>foundation, the moral foundation that I would like them to have.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still being impacted by Kantian, Hegelian, whatever philosophy that&rsquo;s out there in the</p>
<p>West that&rsquo;s destroying the better part.</p>
<p>So you give people freedom, now what do they do with it?</p>
<p>And if they have a bad philosophy, they&rsquo;re going to do bad things with that freedom.</p>
<p>You tell people to do whatever they choose to do.</p>
<p>But if they have bad ideas, they will choose to do bad things.</p>
<p>So it is true that the primacy of morality and the primacy of philosophy has to be recognized.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the primacy of politics.</p>
<p>And indeed, you don&rsquo;t get free societies unless you have some elements of decent philosophy.</p>
<p>But you can get free societies with a rotten philosophy, but they don&rsquo;t stay free for very</p>
<p>long.</p>
<p>So how can it be a decent philosophy if it doesn&rsquo;t care about posterity?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re willing to say, I&rsquo;m offering guidance, I think you should live as a traitor, all</p>
<p>relationships should be voluntary, those are interesting things.</p>
<p>But the moment that it comes to posterity, to the future, to there being a future, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say that there were a society that lived the way, in general, according to your view.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say there was such a society.</p>
<p>How can you not care whether that society is capable of passing it on to the next generation</p>
<p>or not?</p>
<p>But the way to pass it on to the next generation is through ideas and not through having children.</p>
<p>Having children is an individual choice that some people are going to make and some people</p>
<p>are not, but the fundamental that preserves the good life.</p>
<p>What does that even mean?</p>
<p>If every generation from now on, your society that was good at a certain point has half</p>
<p>as many people in it, it&rsquo;s going to very quickly, it&rsquo;s just going to be overrun.</p>
<p>Overrun by whom?</p>
<p>What do you mean overrun by whom?</p>
<p>Are we just totally ahistorical?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re the Spartans and you have all of these warrior values, but you stop having</p>
<p>children, you get overrun, you get defeated.</p>
<p>Well, in the case of Sparta, that&rsquo;s a good thing, not a bad thing.</p>
<p>But I get it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not my point.</p>
<p>You have to have the ability to have enough children to create enough wealth and enough</p>
<p>power, enough strength.</p>
<p>Who makes these kind of conclusions, the decisions about how many you make it as an individual</p>
<p>and you decide that in order to&hellip;</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re not talking about&hellip;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about what kind of intellectual, cultural, religious inheritance you give your</p>
<p>children.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And those are the ideas that I give my children and those ideas are going to perpetuate because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re good ideas.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re bad ideas&hellip;</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re not going to perpetuate.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t be good ideas if they don&rsquo;t produce future generations.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>Why would they not produce future generations?</p>
<p>Because look at every liberal society on earth is in democratic collapse.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a single liberal society on earth today that I&rsquo;m willing to defend.</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re not living by my philosophy, they&rsquo;ve not accepted my ideas.</p>
<p>They have a semblance, they have a semblance of a political system that is a little bit</p>
<p>like what I would like, far from what I would ideal, but they certainly don&rsquo;t have a moral</p>
<p>foundation.</p>
<p>I believe that people who have the right moral foundation, most of them, not all of them,</p>
<p>but most of them will have children, most of them will continue into the future, most</p>
<p>of them will fight for a future, but not because they care what happens in 200 years, but because</p>
<p>they care about their lifetime and part of having fun and enjoying one&rsquo;s lifetime is</p>
<p>having kids, is projecting into the future.</p>
<p>Are you really going to tell me that people have children because it&rsquo;s fun?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re fun when they&rsquo;re four years old.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not fun when they&rsquo;re 15.</p>
<p>When they&rsquo;re 15, they&rsquo;re not fun.</p>
<p>I agree with that.</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re just not fun.</p>
<p>Look, you don&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m learning so much today.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t do this for fun.</p>
<p>Marriage also you don&rsquo;t do for fun.</p>
<p>There are times that are fun and there are times that are not fun.</p>
<p>Fun is not exactly the right word, but you certainly do it for happiness.</p>
<p>You do it for fulfillment.</p>
<p>You do it as a challenge.</p>
<p>You do it for making your life better, for making your life interesting, for making your</p>
<p>life challenging, for embracing.</p>
<p>Part of it is fun, part of it is hard work, but you do it because it makes your life a</p>
<p>better life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting, empirically speaking, if you dissolve the cultural backbone where</p>
<p>everybody comes up, like the background, the moral ideas that everybody is raised with,</p>
<p>if you dissolve that and if you truly emphasize the individual, I think Yoram is saying it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to naturally lead to the dissolution of marriage and all of these concepts.</p>
<p>So basically saying you&rsquo;re not going to choose some of these things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to more and more choose the short term optimization versus the long term optimization</p>
<p>beyond your own life, like posterity.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think about posterity.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what posterity means.</p>
<p>I can project into my children&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Maybe when I have grandchildren, it&rsquo;s the grandchildren&rsquo;s life, but it ends there.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t project 300 years into the future.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ridiculous to try to think about 300 years into the future.</p>
<p>Things change so much.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the founding fathers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the conservative founding fathers.</p>
<p>Well, no, I don&rsquo;t think.</p>
<p>I think they set up a system.</p>
<p>I think the whole idea was to set up a system that was self perpetuating that would if people</p>
<p>lived up to it, right?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Would perpetuate itself into 300 years.</p>
<p>No systems are self perpetuating.</p>
<p>Things rise and fall and it&rsquo;s the&hellip;</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t necessarily rise and fall.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in that.</p>
<p>Let me speak to your heart for a second.</p>
<p>The great individuals in societies are the people who have seen the decline, understood</p>
<p>it and provided resources in order to redirect and bring it back up.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t agree to that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see it that way at all.</p>
<p>Yes, I want people out there to rebel against conventional morality.</p>
<p>I think conventional morality is destructive to their own lives and broadly to posterity</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s unsustainable, it&rsquo;s not good and this goes to&hellip;</p>
<p>I think conventional morality is Christian morality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a morality that&rsquo;s been secularized through Christian lens and I think it&rsquo;s destructive,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t want them to dump that and not replace it with something.</p>
<p>I want and I think it&rsquo;s necessary and essential for people to have a moral code and to have</p>
<p>a moral code.</p>
<p>Morality is a set of guidelines to live your life.</p>
<p>It is a set of values to guide you, to help you identify what is good for you and what</p>
<p>is bad for you.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>Let me argue against it.</p>
<p>Let me&hellip;</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying central to this morality that people should have is reason.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not saying other things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re basically saying reason will arrive a lot of things.</p>
<p>Why are you so sure that reason is so important?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing else.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>But it seems like obvious to you.</p>
<p>So first of all, humans have limited cognitive capacity.</p>
<p>So even to assume the reason could actually function that well from an artificial intelligence</p>
<p>researcher perspective.</p>
<p>It seems&hellip;</p>
<p>The whole discussion about whether there is such a thing as artificial intelligence, whether</p>
<p>that is what it is.</p>
<p>But&hellip;</p>
<p>But see, here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re very confident about this particular thing, but not about other aspects of human</p>
<p>nature that seems to be obviously present.</p>
<p>So yes, human relations, love, connection between us.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very possible to argue that all of the accomplishments of reason would not exist</p>
<p>without the connection of other humans.</p>
<p>But of course that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not obvious though.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that reason is a property of the collective of multiple people interacting</p>
<p>with each other.</p>
<p>When you look at the greatest inventions of human history, some people tell that story</p>
<p>by individual inventors.</p>
<p>You could argue that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Some people say that it&rsquo;s a bunch of people in a room together.</p>
<p>The idea is bubbling.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re saying individual is primary and they have the full power and the capacity</p>
<p>to make choices, I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s necessarily obviously true.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a straw manning going on here of my position, right?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>My favorite thing to do.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t do it and you do it more politely than anybody else I know when you do it.</p>
<p>Of course we all stand on the shoulders of giants.</p>
<p>Of course, invention and science is collaborative.</p>
<p>Not always, not a hundred percent.</p>
<p>Newton stood on the shoulders of giants.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how collaborative he was.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t exactly known as a bubbling up and testing ideas out with other people.</p>
<p>But this is a metaphysical fact.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t eat for me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no collective stomach.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t eat for me.</p>
<p>You know, you can provide me with food, but I need to do the eating.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t think for me.</p>
<p>You can help stimulate my thought.</p>
<p>You can challenge my thinking.</p>
<p>You can add to it.</p>
<p>But in the end of the day, only I can either do my thinking or not do my thinking, but</p>
<p>I need to think.</p>
<p>But you can think all by yourself alone.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>All by yourself.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Can I think on a desert island?</p>
<p>Yes, I can think on a desert island.</p>
<p>Can I think as big and as broad and as deep as I can in Aristotle&rsquo;s Lyceum?</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a much better thinker in Aristotle&rsquo;s Lyceum or in any kind of situation like this</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re going to challenge me and I have to come back and I have to think deeply about</p>
<p>what it is you said and why I&rsquo;m not communicating very effectively and why you&rsquo;re not understanding</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>Of course, now you&rsquo;re causing me to think much more deeply and to challenge me.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still true that I have to think.</p>
<p>And if I don&rsquo;t think for myself, who&rsquo;s going to think for me?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So this is why I&rsquo;m not a philosopher.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly not an original thinker in that sense.</p>
<p>I recognize the fact that there are geniuses that are much smarter than me, whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Aristotle or Ayn Rand or people that inspire me.</p>
<p>I study their work.</p>
<p>I try to understand it to the best of my ability.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t take it as gospel.</p>
<p>I take it as this is something I need to figure out.</p>
<p>I need to learn it.</p>
<p>I need to understand it because it&rsquo;s good for my life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to me.</p>
<p>But I have to do the thinking.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t be mine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be Ayn Rand&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But it won&rsquo;t be mine unless I&rsquo;ve done the thinking to integrate it into my soul, into</p>
<p>my consciousness, into my mind.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still true that I have to think for myself, not on a desert island.</p>
<p>I now regret ever using a desert island in the book as an example, because ‚Ä¶</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve achieved something.</p>
<p>There is progress.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re moving ‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Progress towards truth is taking place.</p>
<p>Because clearly, it was misunderstood.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t make myself clear.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t make myself clear enough in the book in terms of what I meant.</p>
<p>But I do not advocate for thinking alone in a dark room, not engaging with reality, not</p>
<p>studying history, not knowing about the world, or on a desert island, not interacting with</p>
<p>other people.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a collectivist?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a trader.</p>
<p>So I enjoy what we&rsquo;re doing right now because you&rsquo;re challenging me.</p>
<p>You make me a better thinker.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>The fact that a lot of people are going to watch this plays into it as well.</p>
<p>But I would probably enjoy engaging with you in conversation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even recording, so ‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>I would enjoy engaging with you in conversation even if it wasn&rsquo;t being recorded, and even</p>
<p>if it was because that kind of conversation makes me a better ‚Ä¶ There are some people</p>
<p>who I wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>There are some people who make it worse, that you walk away from the conversation because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re harmful to you.</p>
<p>And this is where choice comes in.</p>
<p>I want to be able to choose who I engage with.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t always have that choice because, as a public intellectual, you go in front</p>
<p>of audiences.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t always choose who it is, but you want to choose who you engage with and who</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You want to choose the forum in which you engage and how you engage.</p>
<p>And the standard for me is reason.</p>
<p>There is no other standard.</p>
<p>So you asked a deep question to start off.</p>
<p>Why reason?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s where the values come from.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only tool we have to discover truth.</p>
<p>Yes, you know, reason is something that it doesn&rsquo;t guarantee truth.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t guarantee the world is right, it&rsquo;s fallible.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s all we have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the tool in which we evaluate the world around us and we come to conclusions about</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>There just isn&rsquo;t other tools.</p>
<p>Emotions are not tools of cognition.</p>
<p>Consciousness is a tool.</p>
<p>Emotion like love, all of these things are ways to experience the world to say that reason</p>
<p>is the best tool.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a difference between experiencing the world and evaluating the world in terms</p>
<p>of what is truth or what is not.</p>
<p>As a scientist, I appreciate the value of reason.</p>
<p>And emotions and love are consequences.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not primary.</p>
<p>Emotions are consequences of conclusions you&rsquo;ve come to.</p>
<p>Your emotions will change very quickly, relatively speaking, when your evaluations of a situation</p>
<p>will change.</p>
<p>Different people can see exactly the same scene and have completely different emotions</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re bringing different value systems and they&rsquo;re bringing different thoughts to</p>
<p>the process.</p>
<p>Maybe love is primary.</p>
<p>But let me ask.</p>
<p>Love is the same thing.</p>
<p>You can fall out of love with somebody.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because you learn something new.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ve discovered something new about the person.</p>
<p>Now you don&rsquo;t love them anymore.</p>
<p>This is the wrong podcast to bring up love.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk forever about it.</p>
<p>So, Yoram, you wrote the book, The Virtue of Nationalism, contrasting nation states with</p>
<p>empires and with global governance like United Nations and so on.</p>
<p>So you argue that nationalism uniquely provides the, quote, the collective right of a free</p>
<p>people to rule themselves.</p>
<p>So continuing our conversation, why is this particular collection of humans we call a</p>
<p>nation a uniquely powerful way to preserve the freedom of a people, to have people rule</p>
<p>themselves?</p>
<p>Before I say anything on the subject, I should emphasize that I&rsquo;m not a rationalist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an empiricist and I&rsquo;m offering what I think is a valid observation of human history.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have some kind of deductive framework for proving that the nation is the best.</p>
<p>And empirically, we know something about the way systems of national states work and about</p>
<p>the way empires work and the way tribal societies work.</p>
<p>What we don&rsquo;t know is, you know, is it possible to invent something else?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of things we don&rsquo;t know here.</p>
<p>So with the caveat that I&rsquo;m making an empirical observation, the basic argument is human beings</p>
<p>form collectives naturally, loyalty groups, and for most of human history and prehistory,</p>
<p>as far as we know, human beings lived in tribal societies.</p>
<p>Tribal societies are societies in which there&rsquo;s constant friction and constant warfare among</p>
<p>very small groups, among families and clans.</p>
<p>And we reach a turning point in human history with the invention of large scale agriculture,</p>
<p>which allows the creation of vast wealth.</p>
<p>It allows the establishment of standing armies instead of militias.</p>
<p>You know, Sargon of Akkad says, I can pay 5,000 men to do nothing other than to drill</p>
<p>in the arts of war and then I&rsquo;m gonna send them out to conquer the neighboring city states</p>
<p>and there you have empire.</p>
<p>The Bible, which is the source of our image, our conception of a world of independent nations</p>
<p>that are not constantly trying to conquer one another, the source of that is the Bible.</p>
<p>And the biblical world is one in which Israel and various other small nations are trying</p>
<p>to fight for their independence against world empires, against empires Babylonian, Assyrian,</p>
<p>Persian, Egyptian, which aspire to rule the world.</p>
<p>My claim is fundamentally twofold, it&rsquo;s moral that whenever you conquer a foreign nation,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re murdering and you&rsquo;re stealing, you&rsquo;re destroying.</p>
<p>As your own would say, you&rsquo;re using force to cause people to submit.</p>
<p>So there is something in the prophets that rebels against this ongoing atrocity and carnage</p>
<p>of trying to take over the whole world.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a prudential practical argument, which is that the world is governed best when</p>
<p>there are multiple nations, when they&rsquo;re free to experiment and chart their own courses.</p>
<p>That means they have their own route to God, they have their own moralities, they have</p>
<p>their own forms of economy and government.</p>
<p>And what tends to happen in history is that when something is successful, when something</p>
<p>looks like, when a different nation looks at it and say, well, those people are flourishing,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re succeeding, then it&rsquo;s imitated in the way that the Dutch invented the stock</p>
<p>market and the English said, look, that makes them powerful, so we&rsquo;ll adopt it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s endless examples of that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the argument for it.</p>
<p>The argument is since we don&rsquo;t know a priori deductively from self evident principles what</p>
<p>is best, it&rsquo;s best to have a world in which people are trying different things.</p>
<p>So quick question, because the word nationalism sometimes is presented in negative light in</p>
<p>connection to the nationalism of Nazi Germany, for example.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re looking empirically at a world of nations that respect each other.</p>
<p>I use the word nationalism the way that I inherited it in my tradition, which is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a principled standpoint that says that the world is governed best when many nations are</p>
<p>able to be independent and chart their own course.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nationalism.</p>
<p>As far as the Nazis, Hitler&rsquo;s an imperialist.</p>
<p>He hated nation states.</p>
<p>His whole theory, if you pick up, I don&rsquo;t recommend doing this, but if you do&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually reading it right now, Mein Kampf?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>If you do read Mein Kampf, then you&rsquo;ll see that he says explicitly that the goal is for</p>
<p>Germany to be the lord of the earth and mistress of the globe, and he detests the idea of the</p>
<p>independent nation state because he sees it as weak and defeat.</p>
<p>He might as well have said it&rsquo;s Jewish.</p>
<p>So let me ask from the individual perspective, for nationalism, what do you make of the value</p>
<p>of the love of country?</p>
<p>The reason I connect that&hellip; So I personally, what would you say, a patriot?</p>
<p>I love the love of country.</p>
<p>Or I am susceptible&hellip; Or how should&hellip; In a Randian way, I enjoy&hellip; I in a self interest</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t run away from it.</p>
<p>Well, I love a lot of things, but I&rsquo;m saying this particular love is a little bit contentious,</p>
<p>which is loving your country.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting love that some people are a little uncomfortable with, especially</p>
<p>when that love&hellip; I grew up in the Soviet Union to say you just love the country.</p>
<p>It represents a certain thing to you, and you don&rsquo;t think philosophically like I was</p>
<p>marching around with marks under my arm or something like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just loving community at the level of nation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s an artifact of the past that we&rsquo;re going to have to strip away.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I was just raised in that kind of community, but I appreciate that.</p>
<p>I guess the thing I&rsquo;m torn about is that love of country that I have in my heart that I</p>
<p>now love America and I consider myself an American, that would have easily, if I was</p>
<p>born earlier, been used by Stalin, and I would have proudly died on the battlefield.</p>
<p>I would have proudly died if I was in Nazi Germany as a German, and I would proudly die</p>
<p>as an American.</p>
<p>Are you sure about these things?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I think about this a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to run a radical counterfactual and be sure of the answer.</p>
<p>I mean&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>I think about this a lot because, obviously, I&rsquo;m really interested in history.</p>
<p>This is the way I think about most situations is I empathize.</p>
<p>I really try to do hard work of placing myself in that moment and thinking through it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just&hellip; Okay, I just know myself psychologically.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m susceptible to, that&rsquo;s a negative way to phrase it, but what I would love doing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying, my question is, is the love of nation a useful or a powerful moral, from</p>
<p>a moral philosophy perspective, a good thing?</p>
<p>I think it is a good thing, but before we ask whether it&rsquo;s a good thing, I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worth asking whether there&rsquo;s any way to live without it.</p>
<p>The idea of national independence of a world or a continent which politically is governed</p>
<p>by multiple independent national states, that is a political theory.</p>
<p>Somebody came up with that in the Bible or elsewhere.</p>
<p>Someone came up with this idea and sold it, and a lot of people like it, but the nation</p>
<p>is not an invention.</p>
<p>Every place in human history that we have any record of, there are nations.</p>
<p>The fact of people creating families, families creating an alliance of clans, clans creating</p>
<p>alliances of tribes, tribes creating an alliance that becomes the nation, we see that everywhere</p>
<p>in human history, everywhere we look.</p>
<p>The love of a group of tribes that have come together in order to fight opponents that</p>
<p>are trying to destroy your way of life and steal your land and harm your women and children,</p>
<p>the love of the leadership that brings it together.</p>
<p>This is a George Washington type figure or an Alfred the Great type figure or Saul, the</p>
<p>biblical Saul, somebody who has the wisdom, the daring to unite the tribes, overcome their</p>
<p>internal, mutual hatreds and grievances and rally them around a set of ideas, a language,</p>
<p>a tradition, an identity as people say today.</p>
<p>That love is irradicable from human beings.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll have a brave new world, people will take drugs in order to get rid of it.</p>
<p>The problem is that could be leveraged by authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>Yes, but that&rsquo;s true of everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like saying you can have children and you can teach them to be evil.</p>
<p>You can make a lot of money, you can use it for evil.</p>
<p>You can have a gun for self defense, but you can use it for evil.</p>
<p>Come on, that&rsquo;s human.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s being human.</p>
<p>You guys are making love this primary, which I don&rsquo;t think it is.</p>
<p>How dare you, your honor.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>There are lots of people in the world out there who don&rsquo;t love their nation because</p>
<p>the nation is not worth loving.</p>
<p>That is love is conditional.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not unconditional.</p>
<p>Love is conditioned on the value that&rsquo;s presented to you.</p>
<p>I lived through this experience in my own life.</p>
<p>I grew up in Israel at a time of everything was geared towards patriotism and the state.</p>
<p>I would say I was trained to, when I saw a grenade, to jump on it because that was every</p>
<p>song and every story and everything was about the state is everything and you should sacrifice.</p>
<p>When the flag went up, I got teary eyed.</p>
<p>I bought into it completely and at some point, I rejected that and I changed and I changed</p>
<p>my alliance and I rejected my love of Israel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t love it anymore, but it&rsquo;s certainly not my top love and I&rsquo;m certainly</p>
<p>not looking for the grenade to jump on and I&rsquo;m not volunteering to go fight the war there.</p>
<p>I fell in love from a distance with the idea of America.</p>
<p>I love the idea of America more than I love America.</p>
<p>I could see myself falling out of love with America given where it&rsquo;s heading.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not automatic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s conditioned on what it is that it represents and what value it represents for me.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s always the case with love.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not true that children have to love their parents.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the ideal and hopefully most children love their parents, but some children fall</p>
<p>out of love with their parents because their parents don&rsquo;t deserve their love.</p>
<p>The same with the other way around.</p>
<p>I think parents are capable of not loving their children.</p>
<p>Love is a conditional thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not automatic.</p>
<p>Let me point out an agreement.</p>
<p>Let me say something about an agreement.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to bribe me with an agreement.</p>
<p>To soften the blow, mostly I like to talk to Yaron about his ideas and I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to talk about Ayn Rand, but I want to say something.</p>
<p>Just one thing about Ayn Rand.</p>
<p>All my kids read Ayn Rand&rsquo;s books.</p>
<p>My father read The Fountainhead.</p>
<p>We know Ayn Rand.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you it is incredibly difficult reading for me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s painful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s painful to read.</p>
<p>Why is it painful?</p>
<p>Not because I disagree with the view of trading and business and the creativity of it and</p>
<p>Reardon Metal.</p>
<p>That stuff moves me and I do admire it, but to read a book that&rsquo;s a thousand pages long</p>
<p>in which nobody is having children, nobody is having a stable marriage, no one is running</p>
<p>an admirable government that&rsquo;s fighting for a just cause, anywhere, anywhere.</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s focusing on one aspect of what it is to be human and to flourish and</p>
<p>that everything else is just erased and thrown out as though it&rsquo;s just not part of reality</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m scared.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m scared of what happens to teenagers who hormonally are in any case.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re programmed to pull away from their parents and experiment with things.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re biologically programmed to do that and you give them a book which says, look,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to have a family.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to raise children.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to have a country.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to fight for anything.</p>
<p>All you have to do is assert yourself and trade.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s destructive because it&rsquo;s not realistic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not real.</p>
<p>But I got none of that from Ayn Rand.</p>
<p>I got none of that from Ayn Rand.</p>
<p>The books were not about a family.</p>
<p>You could write a book in Ayn Rand style where people have a family, but the goal, the purpose,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a novel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a novel which is delimited with a particular story.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one family in Gulch Gulch and there&rsquo;s a little passage about raising children and</p>
<p>the value of that because it&rsquo;s not core to what she is writing about, but that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exclude it.</p>
<p>When I read Ayn Rand, I read Atlas Shrugged when I was 16, and I read it over the years</p>
<p>several times more.</p>
<p>It never occurred to me, oh, Ayn Rand&rsquo;s anti family, I shouldn&rsquo;t have a family.</p>
<p>That thought never came into my mind.</p>
<p>I always wanted to have children.</p>
<p>I continue to want to have children.</p>
<p>I thought of it a little differently.</p>
<p>I thought of how I would find a partner a little bit differently.</p>
<p>I thought about what I would look for in a partner differently, but not that I wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to get married.</p>
<p>One question I have is what effect it has on society, so outside of you.</p>
<p>So for example, you mentioned love should be conditional.</p>
<p>I think&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, it is.</p>
<p>Whether you like it or not, it is.</p>
<p>You might pretend that it isn&rsquo;t, but it&rsquo;s always conditional.</p>
<p>Well, let me try to say something and see if it makes any sense.</p>
<p>So could there be things that are true, like love is conditional, is always conditional,</p>
<p>but if you say it often, it has a negative effect on society.</p>
<p>So for example, I mean, so maybe I&rsquo;m just a romantic, but good luck saying love is conditional</p>
<p>to a romantic partner.</p>
<p>I mean, you could, I would argue, en masse, that would deteriorate the quality of relationships.</p>
<p>If you remind the partner of that truth that is universal, like you have to, I mean, okay,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s just me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just speak to myself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like there is a certain romantic notion of unconditional love.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of why you have so many destructive marriages.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of why&hellip;</p>
<p>So you would say that&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s a real problem because, yes, there is a, you talked about honoring your spouse</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a real truth there and I respect that.</p>
<p>Yes, you have to do certain things.</p>
<p>Love is not, you marry somebody and there&rsquo;s a real attitude out there in the culture.</p>
<p>You marry somebody and okay, now we&rsquo;re going to, we&rsquo;re just going to cruise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just&hellip;</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Hollywood.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the Hollywood marriage.</p>
<p>You know, marriage is work.</p>
<p>Like all values, it&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something you have to reignite every day.</p>
<p>You have to, the challenges, the real disagreements, the things you fight about, you disagree</p>
<p>about and there&rsquo;s real, if it&rsquo;s a value, you work it out, you struggle through it.</p>
<p>And sometimes you struggle through it and you come to a conclusion, no, this is not</p>
<p>going to work and you dissolve a marriage and I&rsquo;m all for dissolving after really, really</p>
<p>fighting for it because if it&rsquo;s an important value and if you fell in love with this person</p>
<p>for a reason, then that&rsquo;s something worth fighting for.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that Hollywood goes the other way, but it&rsquo;s not this cruising along and</p>
<p>everything is easy, no human relationship is like that.</p>
<p>Not friendship, not love, not raising children, not being a child.</p>
<p>You know, they require work and they require thinking and they require creating the conditions</p>
<p>to thrive and that&rsquo;s the sense in which it&rsquo;s conditional.</p>
<p>You have to work at it and it&rsquo;s very easy not to do the work and it&rsquo;s very easy to drift</p>
<p>away and I think most people don&rsquo;t do the work, most people take it and generally in</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>The only place people seem to work is at work and then they take the rest of their life</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m going to cruise and yet every aspect of your life, the art you choose, the friends</p>
<p>you choose, the lovers you choose, all require real thinking and real work to be successful</p>
<p>at them.</p>
<p>None of them are just there because there is no such thing as just the intrinsic.</p>
<p>Right, I agree with all of that.</p>
<p>I was going to say before that the rabbis have this sort of shocking expression, tzargidul</p>
<p>banim, the pain of raising children.</p>
<p>And I find when I speak to audiences about relationships, I find that in general and</p>
<p>this is cross cultural, it&rsquo;s different countries, different religious backgrounds, that in general</p>
<p>young people do not know that the only way to make a marriage work is through a lot of</p>
<p>pain and overcoming.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know that raising children involves a great deal of pain.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know that caring for and helping your parents approach the end of their lives</p>
<p>causes a great deal of pain and everything is kind of this sketchy, very sketchy, glimpsy</p>
<p>kind of, and I mentioned Hollywood just because everything is made to look easy except there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of a funny breakdown of something but then maybe there&rsquo;s a divorce, they shoot</p>
<p>one another so then they should get divorced.</p>
<p>But the reality of how hard it is to do and how heroic it is to do it and then overcome</p>
<p>and then actually in the end achieve something, create something that was really, it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>not discussed and so to me it&rsquo;s just not surprising that if there&rsquo;s no parallel to</p>
<p>Ayn Rand about the heroic saving of a marriage that was on the rocks, how does it actually</p>
<p>happen?</p>
<p>So‚Ä¶</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a good point you&rsquo;re making but something just came to me that I&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>thought of before so that&rsquo;s always good.</p>
<p>This is where conversation is good.</p>
<p>Look, take the Talmud and I can&rsquo;t remember how many years after the Bible the Talmud</p>
<p>is written, over how long of a period it&rsquo;s written, how many people participating in</p>
<p>writing it.</p>
<p>Ayn Rand was one individual.</p>
<p>She wrote a series of books on philosophy which I think are true but they&rsquo;re the beginning.</p>
<p>There is a lot of work to be done to apply this.</p>
<p>So hopefully there will be one of her students who writes a book on relationships and there&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be somebody who writes a book on developing a political theory in greater detail and develop</p>
<p>her ethics.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s got a few writings on ethics and it&rsquo;s in the novels but there&rsquo;s a lot of work</p>
<p>to be done, fleshing it out, what does it mean, how do you‚Ä¶</p>
<p>So to say Ayn Rand didn&rsquo;t do everything is a truism.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t do everything.</p>
<p>Okay, so what?</p>
<p>But she laid this amazing philosophical foundation that allows us to take those principles and</p>
<p>to apply them to all these realms of human life and she does it on a scope that few philosophers</p>
<p>in human history have done because she goes from metaphysics all the way to aesthetics,</p>
<p>hitting the key, and she&rsquo;s an original thinker on each one of those things.</p>
<p>And she might be right, she might be wrong on certain aspects of it, always happy to</p>
<p>have a debate about where she&rsquo;s wrong or where she&rsquo;s not, but there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>work to be done, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like ‚Äì and if there were objectivists out there who present it as, okay, human knowledge</p>
<p>is over because Ayn Rand wrote these books, that&rsquo;s absurd, right?</p>
<p>This huge amount of work to be done in applying these particular ideas just like there was</p>
<p>for any philosophy, take these ideas and now apply them to all these realms in human experience</p>
<p>that flesh it out and make it ‚Äì and one of the reasons I don&rsquo;t think objectivism</p>
<p>is taken off is because there&rsquo;s all this work still to be done that allows it to be</p>
<p>relatable to people in every aspect of them.</p>
<p>Let me ask a hard question here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got ‚Äì</p>
<p>Can I say what I agreed with you, Omar?</p>
<p>Sure, sure.</p>
<p>This is good.</p>
<p>This will be a good transition.</p>
<p>Here, this is the clip.</p>
<p>This is the clip.</p>
<p>I agree about nations.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t like the term nationalism because I fear what happens when you put an ism at</p>
<p>the end of any word.</p>
<p>Anything, yes.</p>
<p>But the nation is a good thing.</p>
<p>And having a diversity of nations in a sense is a good thing.</p>
<p>And in this sense, I don&rsquo;t think one can come up ‚Äì so look, I said and I hold that</p>
<p>the ideal nation is a nation that protects individual rights.</p>
<p>How do you do that?</p>
<p>What are the details?</p>
<p>How do we define property rights exactly in an internet world?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be disagreement, rational, reasonable disagreement.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to be ‚Äì in my future, in the 300 years from now, in my ideas of one</p>
<p>finally, right, there will be multiple nations trying to apply the principle of applying</p>
<p>individual rights, and they&rsquo;ll do it differently.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of federalism is that while you have a national government, there</p>
<p>are certain issues that you relegate to states, and they can try different things and learn</p>
<p>because there is a huge value in empirical knowledge comes there.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just deduce it all and figure it all out.</p>
<p>You have to experiment.</p>
<p>So I do ‚Äì I hate the idea of a one world government because experimentation is gone,</p>
<p>and if you make a mistake, everybody suffers.</p>
<p>I like the idea, and then I like the idea of people being able to choose where they</p>
<p>live.</p>
<p>But this notion of experimentation I think is crucial, but you need a principle.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t like the idea of nations if all the nations are going to be bad, right?</p>
<p>If all the nations are going to be horrible, then I don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>What I like is a variety of nations all practicing basically good ideas, and then we try to</p>
<p>figure out, okay, what works better than other things, and what is sustainable and what is</p>
<p>not.</p>
<p>Given how many difficult aspects of history and society we talked about, let me ask a</p>
<p>hard question of both of you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to breeze up until now.</p>
<p>What gives you hope about the future?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve been describing reasons to maybe not have hope.</p>
<p>What gives you hope?</p>
<p>When you look at the world, what gives you hope that in 200 years, in 300 years, in 500</p>
<p>years, like the founders look into the future, that human civilization will be all right,</p>
<p>and more than that, it will flourish?</p>
<p>Two things for me.</p>
<p>One is history.</p>
<p>So in the very long run, good ideas win out.</p>
<p>I think in the very long run, you can go through a dark ages, but you come out of a dark ages.</p>
<p>The good and the just does win in the end, even if it is bloody and difficult and hard</p>
<p>to get there.</p>
<p>So while I am quite pessimistic, unfortunately, about the short run, I&rsquo;m ultimately optimistic</p>
<p>that in the long run, good ideas win and they&rsquo;re justified.</p>
<p>And I think the fundamental behind that is I think is that I&rsquo;m fundamentally positive</p>
<p>about human nature.</p>
<p>I think human beings can think, they&rsquo;re capable of reasoning, they&rsquo;re capable of figuring</p>
<p>out the truth, they&rsquo;re capable of learning from experience.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t always do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an achievement to do it, but over time, they do.</p>
<p>If you create the right circumstances, they will, and when things get bad enough, they</p>
<p>look for a way out.</p>
<p>They look maybe at history, if the history is available to them, maybe at just learning</p>
<p>from what&rsquo;s around them to find better ways of doing things, and that reinforces itself.</p>
<p>But human beings are an amazing creature.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just amazing in our capacity to be creative, in our capacity to think, in our capacity</p>
<p>to love, in our capacity to change our environment to fit our needs and to fit our requirements</p>
<p>for survival and to learn and to grow and to progress.</p>
<p>So again, long term, I think all that wins out.</p>
<p>Short term, in any point in history, short term, right now, it doesn&rsquo;t look too good.</p>
<p>What about you, Yaron?</p>
<p>The source for Yaron&rsquo;s hope is the book of Exodus, which is the first place in human</p>
<p>history where we are presented with the possibility that an enslaved people that&rsquo;s being persecuted</p>
<p>and murdered and living under the worst possible regime can free itself and have a shot at</p>
<p>a life of independence and worth, and it&rsquo;s another inherited Jewish idea in the tradition.</p>
<p>The way that we express this is by saying that there is a God who judges.</p>
<p>The Israelis in Egypt were enslaved for hundreds of years, according to the Exodus story, hundreds</p>
<p>of years before God wakes up and hears them.</p>
<p>And he doesn&rsquo;t do anything until Moses kills the oppressor and goes out into the desert.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s pretty realistic that there is a God that God judges and acts, but probably</p>
<p>often not for a very, very long time and not until there&rsquo;s a human being who gets up and</p>
<p>says enough.</p>
<p>I know that today people don&rsquo;t want to read the Bible.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t like reading the Bible.</p>
<p>But I always hear in my ear this cry of the prophet Jeremiah who saw his nation destroyed</p>
<p>and his people exiled.</p>
<p>And he says, in God&rsquo;s name, he says, he&rsquo;s not my word like fire, like the hammer that</p>
<p>shatters rock, a petition, a petzela.</p>
<p>My word is like fire, like the hammer that shatters rock.</p>
<p>And this is actually the traditional way of saying something like what Yaron is saying</p>
<p>that it may take a long, long time, but there is a truth and it has its own strength and</p>
<p>it will, in the end, shatter the things that are opposing it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our traditional hope.</p>
<p>We grow up like that.</p>
<p>So I do have hope.</p>
<p>I see the trends.</p>
<p>The trends are terrible right now and it&rsquo;s frightening and it&rsquo;s hard, but we are terrible</p>
<p>at seeing the future.</p>
<p>And it is very possible that an unexpected turn of events is going to appear maybe soon,</p>
<p>maybe much later, and the possibility of a redemption is there.</p>
<p>Let me ask, given that long arc of history, given that you do study the Bible, what is</p>
<p>the meaning of this whole thing?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>I think that the meaning of life is in part what Yaron touches on when he says that productive</p>
<p>work, labor, creativity is at the heart of what it is to be human.</p>
<p>I just think that there are some more arenas and maybe we even agree on a lot of them.</p>
<p>To be human is to inherit a world which is imperfect, terribly imperfect, imperfect in</p>
<p>many ways.</p>
<p>And God created it that way.</p>
<p>He created a world which is terribly lacking and he created us with the ability to stand</p>
<p>up and to say, I can change the direction of this.</p>
<p>I can do something to change the direction of this.</p>
<p>I can take the time and the abilities that are given to me to be a partner with God in</p>
<p>creating the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to stay the way it was before me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be something different, maybe a little bit, maybe a lot.</p>
<p>But that is the heart.</p>
<p>That is the key.</p>
<p>That is the meaningful life is to be a partner with God in creating the world so that it</p>
<p>is moving that much more in the right direction rather than the way we found it.</p>
<p>So nudge, even if a little bit, the direction of the world.</p>
<p>Well, Yaron, you&rsquo;ve actually been talking in your program about life quite a bit.</p>
<p>So let me ask the same question and I never tire you of asking this question.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I don&rsquo;t believe in God, so God doesn&rsquo;t play a role in my view of the meaning</p>
<p>of life.</p>
<p>I think the meaning of life is to live.</p>
<p>I like to say to live with a capital L. It&rsquo;s to embrace it and I agree with you on in a</p>
<p>sense we&rsquo;re born into a world and as human beings, one of the things that makes us very</p>
<p>different than other animals is our capacity to change that world.</p>
<p>We can actually go out there and change the world around us.</p>
<p>We can change it materially through production and through, we can change it spiritually</p>
<p>through changing the ideas of people.</p>
<p>We can change the direction to which humanity works.</p>
<p>We can create a little universe.</p>
<p>I think part of the joy of creating a family is to create a little universe.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re creating a little world around us that&rsquo;s part of the joy.</p>
<p>And there is joy in family, let&rsquo;s not make it all about difficulty and hard work.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Part of the idea of getting married is to create a little world in which you and your</p>
<p>spouse are creating something that didn&rsquo;t exist before and building something, building</p>
<p>a universe.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really to live.</p>
<p>And one of the things that I see and it saddens me is wasted lives, is people who just cruise</p>
<p>through life.</p>
<p>They get born in a particular place, they never challenge it, they never question.</p>
<p>They just, you know, they live, die and nothing really happened.</p>
<p>Nothing really changed.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t produce, they didn&rsquo;t make anything of their life.</p>
<p>And produce here, again, in the largest sense.</p>
<p>So to me it&rsquo;s, in every aspect of life, as you know because you&rsquo;ve listened to my show,</p>
<p>I love art, I love aesthetics, I love the experience of great art.</p>
<p>I love relationships, I love producing, I like business, I like that aspect of it.</p>
<p>And I think people are shallow in so many parts of their lives, which saddens me.</p>
<p>If you had eight billion people on this planet, even if it never grew, even if we just stayed</p>
<p>at eight billion, but the eight billion all lived fully, wow.</p>
<p>I mean, what an amazing place this would be, what an amazing experience we would have.</p>
<p>So to me that is, the meaning is just make the most that you have a short period of time</p>
<p>on earth.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>This is it.</p>
<p>And live it, experience it fully and challenge yourself and push yourself.</p>
<p>And let me just say something about optimism.</p>
<p>One source of hope for me in the world in which we live right now is that there are</p>
<p>people who do that, at least in certain realms of their lives.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m inspired, and I know a lot of people don&rsquo;t like me for this, but I&rsquo;m inspired for</p>
<p>example by Silicon Valley, in spite of all the political disagreements I have with them</p>
<p>and all of that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m inspired by people inventing new technologies and building, I&rsquo;m inspired by the people you</p>
<p>talk to about artificial intelligence and about new ideas and about pushing the boundaries</p>
<p>of science.</p>
<p>Those things are exciting and it&rsquo;s terrific to see a world that I think generally is in</p>
<p>decline.</p>
<p>Yet there are these pockets in which people are still creating new ventures and new ideas</p>
<p>and new things.</p>
<p>That inspires me and it gives me hope that that is not dead, that in spite of the decay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in our culture, there&rsquo;s still pockets where that spirit of being human is still</p>
<p>alive and well.</p>
<p>Yeah, they inspire me as well.</p>
<p>Yeah, and they truly live with a capital L, and maybe I can do a star, maybe you can also</p>
<p>put a little bit of love with a capital L out there as well.</p>
<p>Yaron, you knew I would end it that way, wouldn&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>Yaron, thank you so much, this is a huge honor.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the debate yesterday, I really enjoyed the conversation today that you spent</p>
<p>your valuable time with me, it just means a lot.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, this was amazing.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Yaron Brook and Yaron Hosoni.</p>

<p>And now, let me leave you with some words from Edmund Burke.</p>
<p>The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
