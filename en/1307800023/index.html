    <p>Welcome to the History of English podcast, a podcast about the history of the English</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>This is episode 21, Early Germanic Words.</p>
<p>In this episode, we&rsquo;re going to look at the first evidence of Germanic writing, and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to begin looking at the original Germanic language by focusing on the vocabulary</p>
<p>which they used.</p>
<p>But before I begin, let me remind you that the History of the Alphabet series or audiobook</p>
<p>is still available.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s now available through iTunes and Amazon.com and some other online retailers</p>
<p>as well.</p>
<p>I should note that those retailers have also made the series available as individual chapters</p>
<p>also.</p>
<p>So, if you just want to buy a particular chapter, you can do that now.</p>
<p>Most of those retailers are charging 99 cents per chapter, but they set their own prices</p>
<p>for the entire series, so I think the price at iTunes is $9.99 for the entire series,</p>
<p>and Amazon, I believe, is $8.99.</p>
<p>Again, those are their prices, but if you find that those sites are more compatible</p>
<p>with your particular media device, then that&rsquo;s an option.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you can still get the series through my website, historyofenglishpodcast.com.</p>
<p>The series is $6 through my site, so those are some options for you if you&rsquo;re interested</p>
<p>in that series or if you&rsquo;re just interested in supporting the podcast.</p>
<p>So, with that out of the way, let&rsquo;s turn to this episode.</p>
<p>Now last time, we looked at the emergence of the first Germanic-speaking tribes in Northern</p>
<p>Europe, and we tried to establish some of the links between those tribes and the original</p>
<p>Indo-European tribes of the Black Sea region.</p>
<p>And we looked at the expansion of those tribes from their Scandinavian homeland into the</p>
<p>heart of Central Europe, where they gradually replaced the native Celtic tribes in that</p>
<p>region.</p>
<p>And eventually, these tribes met the Roman Empire, which was expanding northward from</p>
<p>the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>And ultimately, the Rhine and the Danube rivers became the de facto border between the Germanic</p>
<p>tribes to the north and east, and the Romans to the south and west.</p>
<p>The time frame for most of these events was between around 600 BC and the first century</p>
<p>AD.</p>
<p>And during this same time frame, it&rsquo;s believed that these Germanic tribes spoke a common</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>There were likely regional and tribal dialects, but overall, these people would have been</p>
<p>able to communicate with each other without any difficulty in a more or less common tongue.</p>
<p>This was the original Germanic language, which linguists call Proto-Germanic.</p>
<p>It was the immediate ancestor of Old English, and it was also the ancestor of modern German,</p>
<p>modern Dutch, and the modern languages of Scandinavia.</p>
<p>So this original Germanic language is analogous in many respects to Latin.</p>
<p>It was spoken around the same time as early Latin, and just as Latin fractured and gave</p>
<p>birth to the modern Romance languages, this Germanic language fractured and gave birth</p>
<p>to many of the modern languages of Northern Europe.</p>
<p>So rather than the many different languages of Western Europe that we have today, things</p>
<p>were much simpler during this earlier period.</p>
<p>Latin was the common lingua franca to the south and west, and this original Germanic</p>
<p>language was the dominant language to the east and the north.</p>
<p>And since this language was the immediate ancestor of English, it&rsquo;s important to take</p>
<p>a closer look at that language.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s do that.</p>
<p>And again, the time frame we&rsquo;re looking at is the period from the time when the Germanic</p>
<p>tribes were still in and around Scandinavia until around the time they met the Romans</p>
<p>around the Rhine and the Danube.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that these early Germanic tribes were illiterate at this</p>
<p>point.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have a written language.</p>
<p>So that means we don&rsquo;t have texts to review.</p>
<p>And also keep in mind that the illiterate Celtic tribes initially occupied Central Europe</p>
<p>between the Germanic tribes to the north and the literate Romans and Greeks to the south.</p>
<p>So among those people who could read and write, like the Romans and the Greeks, there</p>
<p>was very little direct contact with these people of Scandinavia.</p>
<p>So no one can say for sure when this original Germanic language first emerged.</p>
<p>But it was sometime before around 500 BC.</p>
<p>Because by that date, 500 BC, the language was almost certainly being spoken in Scandinavia.</p>
<p>And this would have been shortly before the southern migrations began.</p>
<p>So these people were still confined to this region of northern Europe.</p>
<p>And this language probably began to fracture into distinct dialects around the 1st century</p>
<p>AD.</p>
<p>So for our purposes, the period of this original Germanic language was sometime prior to 500</p>
<p>BC until around the 1st century AD.</p>
<p>Again, this is a very general time frame, but it at least gives us some tangible dates</p>
<p>to work with.</p>
<p>And again, this period roughly corresponds to the period I covered in the last episode.</p>
<p>Now I mentioned that the original Germanic language was not written down, and therefore</p>
<p>there are no texts written in the language.</p>
<p>So you may wonder how we know very much about it at all.</p>
<p>Well the answer is the same way we know about the original Indo-European language, through</p>
<p>reconstruction.</p>
<p>But linguists know even more about this original Germanic language, because they have lots</p>
<p>of texts written in the various Germanic languages shortly after the original language</p>
<p>began to fracture.</p>
<p>For example, they can look at the early Gothic translation of the Bible from the 4th century</p>
<p>AD.</p>
<p>They also have lots of texts in Old English, which began around the 7th century AD.</p>
<p>And after that, they have texts from Scandinavia written in Old Norse.</p>
<p>And they also start to have various texts in other Germanic languages.</p>
<p>So they primarily rely on these sources to reconstruct the earlier common version of</p>
<p>the language.</p>
<p>And these various Germanic languages, like Gothic and Old English and Old Norse, they</p>
<p>were still very very similar at this early date.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s relatively easy to compare those languages and to identify the similarities and common</p>
<p>features between those languages.</p>
<p>And from those sources, linguists can reconstruct a lot of the original vocabulary and</p>
<p>grammar of that earlier common Germanic language.</p>
<p>Now linguists also have a few inscriptions from these early Germanic tribes, which were</p>
<p>written down during the period of that original common language.</p>
<p>Again, these were just inscriptions, not full text, so their usefulness is limited.</p>
<p>But they do provide some additional insight into the language and the culture of these</p>
<p>early tribes.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s begin our look at the beginning.</p>
<p>The earliest known writing which has been discovered in the original Germanic language.</p>
<p>And of course, we don&rsquo;t have text to look at, but we do have an early inscription.</p>
<p>A couple of centuries ago, in the year 1811, 23 bronze helmets were unearthed in modern</p>
<p>day Slovenia, just south of Austria and east of northern Italy.</p>
<p>The helmets were Etruscan style helmets which were probably created in the 4th or 5th century</p>
<p>BC.</p>
<p>And this would have been a time when the Etruscans were still the dominant power in northern</p>
<p>Italy, before the Romans took over there.</p>
<p>But one of those helmets contained an inscription which had been engraved on it, apparently</p>
<p>at some earlier date.</p>
<p>The inscription dated from the 2nd century BC, and it was written in an early version</p>
<p>of the Germanic language.</p>
<p>So this time frame, the 2nd century BC, would have been a time in which the Germanic tribes</p>
<p>were advancing southward from northern Europe.</p>
<p>In fact, that time frame would have corresponded to the time when the Romans were in charge</p>
<p>of northern Italy and the Teutons and the Cimbri were migrating southward and were threatening</p>
<p>the Romans.</p>
<p>Now the key here is that this inscription is very short, but it contains a clearly Germanic</p>
<p>name.</p>
<p>That makes it the first known writing in a Germanic language.</p>
<p>This would have been about a century before the Romans invaded Gaul and set their sights</p>
<p>on western Europe.</p>
<p>So this would have been a period when Europe north of Italy was still primarily Celtic.</p>
<p>But more and more Germanic tribes were advancing southward into the region.</p>
<p>So that may have been the source of the inscription, but no one really knows for certain.</p>
<p>All they know is that this inscription contains a Germanic name and an inscription in the</p>
<p>early Germanic language.</p>
<p>So what did the inscription say?</p>
<p>Well that&rsquo;s actually a difficult question to answer.</p>
<p>The inscription actually contains only 16 letters.</p>
<p>The first eight letters spell a Germanic name, Haragast, and it&rsquo;s spelled H-A-R-I-G-A-S-T.</p>
<p>The rest of the inscription is I-T-E-I-V-A followed by a few markings and then the letters</p>
<p>I and P.</p>
<p>As I said, the first part of that inscription contains the word Haragast, which has been</p>
<p>interpreted as a Germanic name.</p>
<p>There seems to be a general consensus among scholars that this is in fact a Germanic name,</p>
<p>but the rest continues to be the subject of debate.</p>
<p>Some think Haragast is the name of a god and the inscription reads, Dedicated to the God</p>
<p>Haragast.</p>
<p>Others think the name refers to the owner of the helmet and it means, Dedicated to the</p>
<p>God Tieva by Haragast.</p>
<p>There are still others who think Haragast means Army Guest or Army Host.</p>
<p>Anyway, regardless of the actual meaning of the inscription, it does appear to be the</p>
<p>first documented Germanic writing.</p>
<p>Since the inscription is so short, it doesn&rsquo;t provide any significant insight into the language</p>
<p>itself, but it is notable given its timing and location.</p>
<p>It confirms that the original Germanic language had reached parts of southern Europe by the</p>
<p>second century BC.</p>
<p>But the inscription is also significant because of the way it was written.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve noted, these original Germanic speakers didn&rsquo;t have a written language, so there</p>
<p>was no Germanic alphabet or script at this early date.</p>
<p>Now these Germanic tribes did develop an alphabetic script using runic symbols, but that runic</p>
<p>writing wasn&rsquo;t in use among the Germanic tribes until a couple of centuries after this</p>
<p>inscription would have been written.</p>
<p>Now initially, scholars thought the writing on the helmet was a very early form of the</p>
<p>later Germanic runic symbols.</p>
<p>But it turns out the symbols were an alphabetic script used by the Etruscans.</p>
<p>In the years after the helmet was discovered, scholars began to learn much more about the</p>
<p>Etruscan language and its alphabetic script, which remember was borrowed from the Greeks</p>
<p>and was later borrowed by the Romans.</p>
<p>But after the Romans borrowed it around 600 BC, the Etruscan script continued to evolve</p>
<p>within the Etruscan language.</p>
<p>So the Etruscan script and the Roman script became more and more distinct from each other.</p>
<p>And this was just like the Greek alphabet, which continued to evolve within Greece after</p>
<p>it was borrowed by the Etruscans.</p>
<p>So the later Etruscan script of the 2nd century BC was different from the version which had</p>
<p>been borrowed by the Romans about 400 years earlier.</p>
<p>And so later scholars have concluded that this writing wasn&rsquo;t an early form of runic</p>
<p>writing, it was just the later Etruscan writing.</p>
<p>But this is still an important point because scholars believe that the runic symbols used</p>
<p>by the later Germanic tribes originated with the Etruscan script of northern Italy.</p>
<p>They know that the early Germanic tribes who migrated southward actively traded with the</p>
<p>Etruscans in and around northern Italy and the areas north of Italy.</p>
<p>And in the process, it&rsquo;s believed that the early Germans encountered the Etruscan alphabet.</p>
<p>And the discovery of this helmet in Slovenia seems to confirm that.</p>
<p>We have a Germanic inscription on a helmet found in Slovenia, which is just east of northern</p>
<p>Italy, but it&rsquo;s written in the Etruscan script.</p>
<p>So that all seems to make sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s believed that over time this Etruscan script traveled northward among the Germanic</p>
<p>tribes and was modified along the way so that it eventually produced the runic symbols which</p>
<p>were in common use among the Germanic tribes in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD.</p>
<p>Now since runic writing wasn&rsquo;t in common use among the Germanic tribes for a couple</p>
<p>more centuries, I&rsquo;m not going to discuss it in detail here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll save it for the next episode when we begin to look at the period after the 1st</p>
<p>century when the original Germanic language began to fracture into the various regional</p>
<p>and tribal languages.</p>
<p>And it was really at that point that we start to see runic inscriptions popping up in these</p>
<p>regions.</p>
<p>But at this earlier date, during the period of the original Germanic language, we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really have runic symbols yet.</p>
<p>But again, we&rsquo;re starting to see some of the possible links between the Etruscan script</p>
<p>and the Germanic language.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll leave the topic of the runic symbols there for now.</p>
<p>So back to the original Germanic language itself.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve established, archaeology can help determine the overall spread of the language,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t help us very much with the language itself.</p>
<p>Again, most of what&rsquo;s known about the original common Germanic language comes from reconstructions</p>
<p>based on later writings in the various languages which developed from that original language.</p>
<p>And those reconstructions reveal quite a bit about the vocabulary and the grammar and the</p>
<p>syntax of that original language.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a look at the vocabulary, or words, of these original Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>As we begin our look at Germanic words, I should note that you probably know more about</p>
<p>the original Germanic language than you might realize, especially if you&rsquo;ve listened to</p>
<p>earlier episodes of the podcast.</p>
<p>You probably remember the earlier discussions about Jacob Grimm and the specific sound changes</p>
<p>which he identified.</p>
<p>If you recall, he noted that the sounds of specific consonants changed between the time</p>
<p>of the original Indo-European language and the first Germanic languages.</p>
<p>This is what we call Grimm&rsquo;s Law today, and I went through all of those changes back in</p>
<p>episode 4.</p>
<p>Well since these changes are common throughout the Germanic languages, it means that they</p>
<p>occurred very early on, and they&rsquo;re a feature of the original Germanic language.</p>
<p>So at some point, while these early Germanic tribes were still in Scandinavia, or perhaps</p>
<p>before while they were still migrating into that region, the sound shifts that we know</p>
<p>today as Grimm&rsquo;s Law occurred.</p>
<p>So by the time we get to the original Germanic language, the Indo-European P sound was being</p>
<p>pronounced as an F sound, and the Indo-European K sound was being pronounced as an H sound,</p>
<p>and all of the other sounds were being pronounced in the manner I discussed back in episode</p>
<p>4.</p>
<p>Now let me explore that a little bit further before we move on.</p>
<p>When I looked at all of those sound changes back in episode 4, they probably seemed very</p>
<p>random, but linguists who study these types of things will note that the changes were</p>
<p>actually very orderly.</p>
<p>First, all of the original Indo-European sounds which changed fell into a class of sounds</p>
<p>which linguists call stops.</p>
<p>This basically refers to sounds which occur when your breath is briefly stopped and then</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s released to create the sound.</p>
<p>So stops include sounds like the B sound, and the D sound, and the G sound.</p>
<p>These three sounds also involve the vocal cords when the breath is released, so linguists</p>
<p>call these three sounds voiced stops.</p>
<p>And these were three of the sounds which changed under Grimm&rsquo;s Law.</p>
<p>And those same three sounds which are voiced with the vocal cords have corresponding sounds</p>
<p>which are made the same way without the vocal cords.</p>
<p>And these are called voiceless stops.</p>
<p>The voiceless version of the B sound is the P sound, p.</p>
<p>And the voiceless version of the D sound is the T sound, t.</p>
<p>And the voiceless version of the G sound is the K sound, k.</p>
<p>And if you have a really good memory, you&rsquo;ll notice a connection there.</p>
<p>All three of the voiced stops, B, D, and G, shifted to the voiceless stops, P, T, and</p>
<p>K.</p>
<p>So in other words, for some reason, the early Germanic tribes stopped using their vocal</p>
<p>cords when they pronounced those three voiced sounds, b, d, and g.</p>
<p>And as a result, without the vocal cords, the sounds became p, t, and k.</p>
<p>And that may be a little tough for you to hear because I actually have to use my vocal</p>
<p>cords to pronounce those later, unvoiced sounds, so you can hear them on the podcast.</p>
<p>But the point here is that this was actually a very subtle change which was made, but it</p>
<p>had a significant impact on the language.</p>
<p>Now what about those three voiceless sounds which were created, the P, and the T, and</p>
<p>the K sounds?</p>
<p>Well, those were the other three sounds that shifted between the original Indo-European</p>
<p>period and the early Germanic period.</p>
<p>And I discussed those three changes back in episode 4 as well.</p>
<p>Remember, the P sound became an F sound, and the T sound became a TH sound, and the K sound</p>
<p>became an H sound.</p>
<p>Well, those three new sounds, the F sound, the TH sound, and the H sound, those are all</p>
<p>called fricatives.</p>
<p>And unlike stops where the breath is interrupted briefly before the sound is produced, a fricative</p>
<p>flows smoothly without interruption.</p>
<p>So TH, or TH, or H, those sounds flow without stopping.</p>
<p>So again, for some reason, these early Germanic speakers stopped stopping those three specific</p>
<p>voiceless stops, and they converted them into sounds which are called voiceless fricatives.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s a lot of technical stuff, which you don&rsquo;t really need to know.</p>
<p>But I mention it because I want you to see that these changes were not completely random.</p>
<p>As is often the case, these sound changes reflect different patterns of pronunciation.</p>
<p>Over time, people tend to slur certain sounds, or they make subtle changes in the way certain</p>
<p>sounds are pronounced.</p>
<p>And this has a ripple effect.</p>
<p>These subtle changes sometimes affect a single sound, but often they affect a series of related</p>
<p>sounds.</p>
<p>In this case, all of the sounds which changed under Grimm&rsquo;s Law were sounds called stops,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a brief interruption of the breath, like I said.</p>
<p>And for some reason, the Germanic tribes had issues with these sounds, and they started</p>
<p>to pronounce them in slightly different ways.</p>
<p>And those pronunciation changes are still reflected in all of the modern Germanic languages,</p>
<p>including English.</p>
<p>And in fact, those changes are part of what distinguishes the Germanic languages from</p>
<p>the other Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>And it all goes back to these original Germanic-speaking tribes in and around Scandinavia who started</p>
<p>pronouncing those sounds differently.</p>
<p>So that covers six specific sound changes identified by Jacob Grimm, and those were</p>
<p>the six that I focused on back in Episode 4, because those are the sounds which we still</p>
<p>have in modern English.</p>
<p>But you might remember from that episode that there were actually three other sounds which</p>
<p>shifted under Grimm&rsquo;s Law during this period.</p>
<p>And I only mentioned them briefly in that episode.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re actually important for this episode.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look at those other three sound shifts now.</p>
<p>These were the three very aspirated or breathy sounds which existed in the original Indo-European</p>
<p>language, but which lost their aspiration or breathiness in the early Germanic language.</p>
<p>So there was originally a very aspirated B sound, bah, which became just a regular B</p>
<p>sound, bah.</p>
<p>And there was a very aspirated D sound, dah, which became just a regular D sound, dah.</p>
<p>And there was a very aspirated G sound, guh, which became a regular G sound, guh.</p>
<p>So again, these changes were very subtle.</p>
<p>They basically remained the same, but they just lost the aspiration or breathiness.</p>
<p>But notice those three sounds again.</p>
<p>The B sound, the D sound, the G sound.</p>
<p>Those are the same three voice stops that eventually shifted to the voiceless stops,</p>
<p>P, T, and K.</p>
<p>So again, we&rsquo;re looking at the same group of basic sounds here.</p>
<p>Again, there was a very subtle change here where the early Germanic tribes had inherited</p>
<p>aspirated versions of these three sounds, but for some reason they simply got rid of</p>
<p>the aspiration.</p>
<p>They just started pronouncing the sounds like we do today, without all of that air or breath</p>
<p>involved.</p>
<p>So you may be saying, fine, what&rsquo;s the big deal about that?</p>
<p>Well, the big deal is that these three aspirated sounds changed very subtly in the Germanic</p>
<p>languages, but they changed much more radically in the other Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>And this makes for some great etymology.</p>
<p>So again, let&rsquo;s go back to the first six sounds I discussed.</p>
<p>The B sound, the D sound, the G sound, the P sound, the T sound, and the K sound.</p>
<p>As we know, all of those sounds changed to new sounds among those very early Germanic</p>
<p>speaking tribes.</p>
<p>But these sounds didn&rsquo;t really change in Latin or Greek.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I was able to use Latin and Greek words to illustrate those changes back</p>
<p>in episode four.</p>
<p>Since Latin and Greek retained the original Indo-European sounds, I could simply put an</p>
<p>English word up against a Latin or Greek word and you could see how the sound shifted.</p>
<p>But in these last three sounds I just mentioned, the aspirated sounds, the tables are reversed.</p>
<p>Other than losing their aspiration, they remain basically the same in the Germanic languages,</p>
<p>but the sounds shifted in Greek and Latin.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a look at a few examples.</p>
<p>Remember that among the early Germanic speakers, the aspirated B sound, ba, became a regular</p>
<p>B sound, ba.</p>
<p>But within Latin, that aspirated B sound became an F sound in many contexts.</p>
<p>So the original Indo-European word, brotar, led to the modern English word, brother.</p>
<p>But it also created the Latin word, frotar.</p>
<p>And frotar is the root of Latin-derived words like fraternal and fraternity.</p>
<p>Both of those terms mean brotherly or brotherhood in modern English.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re both cognate with the word brother thanks to that Latin sound shift.</p>
<p>And among the early Germanic speakers, that aspirated D sound, da, became a regular D</p>
<p>sound, da.</p>
<p>But within Latin, that aspirated D sound also became an F sound in many contexts.</p>
<p>So an original Indo-European word like, dwar, led to the modern English word, door.</p>
<p>But within Latin, that aspirated D sound became an F sound and produced the Latin word, forest,</p>
<p>which also originally meant door, but came to mean outside of the door or simply outside.</p>
<p>And that word, forest, gave us words like forum, originally referring to the Roman marketplace,</p>
<p>which was outside in the open.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve mentioned in earlier episodes that the word, forum, also gave us words like forensic.</p>
<p>And that same Latin word, forest, also gave us the word, foreign, meaning not domestic</p>
<p>or inside the house, but beyond the door from far away.</p>
<p>It also gave us the word, forest, which originally meant trees outside of the house.</p>
<p>And it even gave us the word, foreclose, which basically means to shut the door or</p>
<p>to shut someone outside of the house so they can&rsquo;t get in.</p>
<p>So, forum, forensic, foreign, forest, and foreclose are all cognate with the English</p>
<p>word, door, thanks to that early Latin sound shift.</p>
<p>And lastly, among the early Germanic speakers, that aspirated G sound, ga, became a regular</p>
<p>G sound, ga.</p>
<p>But within Latin, the aspirated G sound became an H sound in many contexts.</p>
<p>Since the H sound is basically just a breathy sound or an aspirated sound, the Latin speakers</p>
<p>dropped the G part of the sound and held on to the H part of the sound, or the aspirated</p>
<p>part of the sound.</p>
<p>The net result of this change is that when we look at very old English words and very</p>
<p>old Latin words, we should expect to see a G in the English words, where an H appears</p>
<p>in Latin words.</p>
<p>And that is in fact what we often see.</p>
<p>I mentioned in an earlier episode about Indo-European words, that the original Indo-European word</p>
<p>ghasti, produced both the words guest and host in modern English.</p>
<p>Well, this is how that happened.</p>
<p>Within the Germanic languages, the aspirated G became a normal G, so the word guest comes</p>
<p>from the Germanic speakers.</p>
<p>Specifically, it came into English as a borrowing from Old Norse, the language of the Vikings</p>
<p>and a related Germanic language.</p>
<p>But host comes into English via Latin.</p>
<p>The Indo-European word ghasti became hostus in Latin, and that produced later words like</p>
<p>host and hostel and hotel and hospital.</p>
<p>So we see that Latin sound shift there.</p>
<p>Another good example of this same sound shift occurs in certain words related to gardens.</p>
<p>The original Indo-European language had a word which was something like cordo.</p>
<p>In the Germanic language, this aspirated G at the beginning became a regular G, and it</p>
<p>produced the original Germanic word gardas.</p>
<p>That word produced the word gardo among the Germanic Frankish tribes.</p>
<p>And the Franks later conquered Gaul, and their Germanic language became mixed with Old French.</p>
<p>So that Frankish word gardo passed through Old North French and then later into English</p>
<p>as garden.</p>
<p>The same original Germanic word passed into modern German as garten as in kindergarten,</p>
<p>which literally means child&rsquo;s garden.</p>
<p>That same original Germanic word passed into Old English as guard.</p>
<p>But another sound shift occurred in Old English which converted the initial G sound to a Y</p>
<p>sound in many Old English words.</p>
<p>So the word eventually came to be pronounced as yard.</p>
<p>So the modern English word yard comes from the same Germanic root as the word garden.</p>
<p>But what about Latin?</p>
<p>Well remember, the aspirated G sound shifted to an H sound in Latin.</p>
<p>And in Latin, that original Indo-European word gordo became hortus.</p>
<p>And of course that word gave us the modern English word horticulture.</p>
<p>So garden, yard, and horticulture are all cognate thanks to those sound shifts within</p>
<p>early Latin and Old English.</p>
<p>Now the major point of all this is twofold.</p>
<p>First, sound shifts were not unique to the Germanic speakers.</p>
<p>Sounds also shifted in the other Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>And remember that the process of reconstructing the original Indo-European language involves</p>
<p>identifying these specific sound changes within each language family and applying those sound</p>
<p>shift rules in reverse to create an original form of the word in the common Indo-European</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>So hopefully you already knew that.</p>
<p>The other point is that some sounds shifted in the Germanic languages while they remained</p>
<p>the same in other languages.</p>
<p>But the reverse also happened.</p>
<p>Sometimes the Germanic languages held on to the original Indo-European sounds, or at least</p>
<p>very similar versions of those sounds, while other languages shifted those sounds around</p>
<p>and created new sounds.</p>
<p>But the bottom line here is that we can identify the specific sound changes which occurred</p>
<p>among these original Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>Now everything I just discussed, and everything I discussed with respect to Grimslaw back</p>
<p>in episode 4, only applies to words which passed from the original Indo-European language</p>
<p>into the original Germanic language.</p>
<p>But this brings us to the next major point, which is that only a portion of the original</p>
<p>Germanic vocabulary was inherited from the Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>In fact, a very large portion of the core vocabulary of the original Germanic language</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t Indo-European at all.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s consider that very important fact.</p>
<p>In one of the earlier episodes of the podcast, I talked about the core vocabulary of modern</p>
<p>English.</p>
<p>I noted that there are relatively few Germanic words overall in modern English in comparison</p>
<p>to Latin, Greek, and other borrowed words.</p>
<p>But even though there are relatively few Germanic words, they dominate our core vocabulary.</p>
<p>49 of the 50 most commonly used words in English are Germanic, and 183 out of the 200 most</p>
<p>commonly used words are also Germanic.</p>
<p>These Germanic words tend to be the first words children learn, and they&rsquo;re the words</p>
<p>we still tend to use the most often.</p>
<p>So our numbers, our body parts, our basic verbs and pronouns, and our close family relations</p>
<p>like mother-father, brother-sister, child-husband-wife, all of these ultimately come from Old English.</p>
<p>I used the oak tree analogy, and I pointed out that these are the roots and the trunk</p>
<p>of the English oak tree.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re our core vocabulary, so they&rsquo;re very old words, and they don&rsquo;t change very</p>
<p>much over time.</p>
<p>Now I mention all this because we should expect that the core vocabulary of modern English</p>
<p>can be traced back to Middle English, and back from there to Old English, and back from</p>
<p>there to the original Germanic language.</p>
<p>And in fact, that&rsquo;s generally the case.</p>
<p>We can do that.</p>
<p>But by the same token, we should be able to trace those same words back to the original</p>
<p>Indo-European language.</p>
<p>After all, it&rsquo;s our core vocabulary.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s where things start to fall apart.</p>
<p>While there are many words that we can trace back to that original Indo-European language,</p>
<p>there are a lot of those words that can&rsquo;t be traced back to that original language.</p>
<p>Back in the episodes where I discussed some of the words of the original Indo-European</p>
<p>language, I noted that many of the words we use in modern English don&rsquo;t come from that</p>
<p>original language.</p>
<p>Remember that?</p>
<p>For example, a word like horse goes back to the original Germanic language, but it can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be definitively traced back further than that.</p>
<p>The Indo-European word for horse was the word that ultimately gives us words like equine</p>
<p>and equestrian.</p>
<p>But the early Germanic tribes apparently got the original version of the word horse from</p>
<p>somewhere else.</p>
<p>The same is true for a word like pig.</p>
<p>It goes back to the original Germanic language.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no evidence of it prior to that.</p>
<p>The Indo-European word ultimately gave us the word pork via Latin, but pig is not cognate</p>
<p>with pork.</p>
<p>The early Germans got the word pig from somewhere else.</p>
<p>Sheep is another example.</p>
<p>The word originated within the original Germanic tribes, but the Indo-European word for the</p>
<p>same animal gave us the word ue, e-w-e.</p>
<p>So again, the early Germans borrowed the word sheep from somewhere else.</p>
<p>I also noted the word house back in those episodes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very basic word, and it&rsquo;s the type of word that we would expect to have</p>
<p>very strong Indo-European roots.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Again, it can clearly be traced back to the original Germanic language, but no one knows</p>
<p>where they got that basic word from.</p>
<p>Again, there&rsquo;s no evidence of it in the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>The original Indo-European word gives us words like domicile and domestic via Latin.</p>
<p>But again, the Germanic tribes got the word house from somewhere else.</p>
<p>And we can also look at the word sea, s-c-a, meaning ocean.</p>
<p>Again, it has very strong Germanic roots, but it doesn&rsquo;t have any roots within the</p>
<p>original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>The Indo-European word gave us the word mare, as in mermaid.</p>
<p>Again, we would expect a basic word like sea to have even deeper roots in the Indo-European</p>
<p>language, but it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Now, there are a ton of these words.</p>
<p>But let me just mention a few others that I haven&rsquo;t mentioned before, or at least</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I have.</p>
<p>For example, body parts like blood, bone, hand, leg, shoulder, womb, those all go back</p>
<p>to the original Germanic language, but they&rsquo;re not Indo-European.</p>
<p>Even the word body can be traced back to that original Germanic language, but really not</p>
<p>beyond that.</p>
<p>The same is true for certain close family relations, words like child, wife, and bride.</p>
<p>Again, very common words which are part of our core vocabulary, but we can&rsquo;t trace</p>
<p>them beyond the Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>And here are just a few others.</p>
<p>Basic words like all, back, drink, drive, eel, e-e-l, foul, f-o-w-l, game, gate, ground,</p>
<p>hold, leap, like, meet, near, rain, rat, rise, ship, sick, theft.</p>
<p>Again, these are incredibly common words, but we can&rsquo;t trace them beyond the early</p>
<p>Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re Germanic words, they come from the original Germanic language, but again, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no evidence of the words beyond that point.</p>
<p>And again, this is just a tiny sampling of the very common core words that the early</p>
<p>Germanic tribes apparently got from somewhere other than their Indo-European ancestors.</p>
<p>So what happened here?</p>
<p>Well, no one knows for certain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly possible that some of these words do in fact have Indo-European origins.</p>
<p>No one really believes that the entire original Indo-European language has been reconstructed,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s possible that some of these words passed from the original Indo-European language</p>
<p>to the early Germans, but for some reason those words died out in all the other Indo-European</p>
<p>languages.</p>
<p>And therefore, these words can&rsquo;t be reconstructed back to the original Indo-European language</p>
<p>since we don&rsquo;t have existing cognates in the other Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>Now again, this could account for a few words here and there, but most of the words I mentioned</p>
<p>appear to have originated elsewhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that the Germanic tribes simply made up some words, but again, historical</p>
<p>linguists note that completely made up words are actually pretty rare.</p>
<p>I mean, people will borrow words and combine them and split them up and change them around,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t tend to just make up words from nothing.</p>
<p>And again, when they do, it doesn&rsquo;t tend to be part of the core vocabulary.</p>
<p>So most modern linguists assume that the early Germanic tribes borrowed these core words</p>
<p>from other people who they encountered in Scandinavia, or perhaps at earlier points</p>
<p>during their migrations from the Indo-European homeland to the Germanic homeland in Scandinavia.</p>
<p>Last time I mentioned the Corded Ware people who occupied northern Europe at a time when</p>
<p>the Indo-Europeans were moving northward.</p>
<p>So perhaps these words came from some of these Corded Ware people.</p>
<p>But the more accepted theory is that these words came from the native people who occupied</p>
<p>Scandinavia before the Indo-Europeans settled there.</p>
<p>This is partly because these words are unique to the Germanic languages.</p>
<p>So that suggests that these words were borrowed later, after the Germanic tribes were in place</p>
<p>in northern Europe.</p>
<p>But the big clue is the nature of these words.</p>
<p>Again, these words are part of the core vocabulary of the original Germanic language, and in</p>
<p>fact they&rsquo;re still part of our core vocabulary in modern English over 2,500 years later.</p>
<p>That suggests that these words were not casually borrowed from some other existing non-Indo-European</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more likely that what we have is a blending of languages, or at least a blending of vocabularies.</p>
<p>One popular theory is that a dominant Indo-European tribal culture settled in Scandinavia.</p>
<p>They encountered native peoples who they ruled over and who eventually they began to marry.</p>
<p>And they produced children who spoke both languages and were familiar with the core</p>
<p>words of both languages.</p>
<p>And over time the core vocabulary of the Indo-European language began to mix with the core vocabulary</p>
<p>of the native peoples.</p>
<p>The result was the language which we know today as the original Germanic language.</p>
<p>Now this theory has some support when we look at other events in history.</p>
<p>For example, in the midst of the Viking invasions of Britain, a large number of these Scandinavian</p>
<p>invaders conquered and settled in a large portion of central and northern England which</p>
<p>was called the Danelaw.</p>
<p>Now over time, these Old Norse speakers began to interact with and began to marry Old English</p>
<p>speakers.</p>
<p>And over the next few generations, Old English began to adopt a large number of these Old</p>
<p>Norse words.</p>
<p>But unlike what happened when the Norman French invaded a little later, the Old Norse words</p>
<p>actually became part of the core vocabulary of English.</p>
<p>French really didn&rsquo;t do that, at least not as much.</p>
<p>French gave English an incredible number of words, but they tended to supplement the core</p>
<p>vocabulary, not replace it.</p>
<p>For example, English kept Germanic words like pig and cow and chicken.</p>
<p>And they supplemented the language with French words like pork and beef and poultry.</p>
<p>The words referring to the cooked versions came from French, but the words for the animals</p>
<p>themselves remained the original Germanic words.</p>
<p>And French was imposed from the top down.</p>
<p>But the interaction with the Norse speakers was different.</p>
<p>Old Norse and Old English were really just different versions of a common language.</p>
<p>And they were on a more equal footing at this point in time.</p>
<p>And Old Norse words actually began to replace Old English words within the core vocabulary</p>
<p>itself.</p>
<p>So, basic pronouns like they, them, and their came from Old Norse.</p>
<p>And even a basic pronoun like she came from Old Norse, it&rsquo;s not Old English.</p>
<p>Those are basic words.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t just wake up one day and decide to start using completely different pronouns.</p>
<p>That type of borrowing comes from a mixing of languages, where both versions of the word</p>
<p>exist side by side for a while, and then one version of the word eventually wins out over</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>And so, as we go back to the original Germanic language, a large number of non-Indo-European</p>
<p>words in the core vocabulary of that original Germanic language suggest that there was this</p>
<p>same mixing of peoples in and around Scandinavia.</p>
<p>Over time, the native, non-Indo-Europeans were assimilated into the Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>And the Germanic vocabulary which resulted was really a mixture of these two languages,</p>
<p>or maybe more than two languages.</p>
<p>At least that&rsquo;s a theory.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s true, it means that a very large percentage of the basic words which we use</p>
<p>every day came from these native Scandinavians, whoever they were.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to conclude my look at the original Germanic vocabulary on that note.</p>
<p>Next time, I&rsquo;m going to focus a bit on the grammar of the original Germanic language.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m also going to look at the early division of the language into basic Northern, Eastern,</p>
<p>and Western dialects.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m going to look in more detail at the early runic writing which developed</p>
<p>within these early Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>So until next time, thanks for listening to the History of English podcast.</p>
