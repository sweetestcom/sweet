    <p>Our card this week is Darwin Vest, the King of Hearts from Idaho.</p>
<p>On a summer night in 1999, Darwin, a quirky intellectual</p>
<p>who was obsessed with studying spiders,</p>
<p>decided to go out to the bars with some friends</p>
<p>because he had just gotten some amazing news.</p>
<p>But after his final nightcap, Darwin wandered out the side door of a bar</p>
<p>and into a dark alley, triggering a mystery</p>
<p>that no one in 23 years has been able to solve.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>It was late on Friday, June 4th, 1999,</p>
<p>and Eric Seneff had just gotten back to his house in Idaho Falls, Idaho,</p>
<p>when he saw a red light blinking,</p>
<p>indicating a new message on his answering machine.</p>
<p>Eric had been gone all day because he and his wife</p>
<p>had went to Salt Lake City, Utah,</p>
<p>to see The Phantom of the Opera on Broadway,</p>
<p>and instead of staying overnight in the city,</p>
<p>they drove the three hours back home to Idaho after the performance.</p>
<p>They hadn&rsquo;t been expecting any calls that day,</p>
<p>so even though it was late, Eric went ahead and played the message,</p>
<p>which was from his friend Darwin&rsquo;s mom, Margaret Vest.</p>
<p>She was frantic, and so, you know,</p>
<p>she was hoping that Darwin was with us, you know,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;d oftentimes go with us on different outings and things, you know.</p>
<p>So I did call her back and said, no, he was, he&rsquo;s not with us.</p>
<p>Margaret told Eric that her 48-year-old son, Darwin,</p>
<p>had not been home in nearly two days, and she was sick with worry.</p>
<p>You see, Darwin still lived at home,</p>
<p>so he saw his mother nearly every day.</p>
<p>This whole time, she&rsquo;d been holding out hope</p>
<p>that Darwin had gone to Utah with Eric</p>
<p>and had just forgotten to mention it to her,</p>
<p>but Eric told Margaret that he hadn&rsquo;t seen Darwin since Wednesday night,</p>
<p>when they had played trivia together at a local bar called The Frosty Gator.</p>
<p>The Frosty Gator was their usual weekly meetup spot for trivia,</p>
<p>and Eric said nothing weird happened.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it just seemed like an ordinary night.</p>
<p>It was, you know, it wasn&rsquo;t that busy in there.</p>
<p>I mean, there were probably 20, 30 people in there, you know.</p>
<p>It was a Wednesday night, and that night,</p>
<p>we had, you know, just a fun evening with playing trivia.</p>
<p>On the phone, Eric explained to Margaret</p>
<p>that when he left The Frosty Gator Wednesday night at around 11.30,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d offered Darwin a ride home because it was raining outside,</p>
<p>but that Darwin had declined</p>
<p>and said he was gonna hang out a little while longer.</p>
<p>From what he knew, Darwin had stayed behind</p>
<p>for another round of drinks with their other friend,</p>
<p>this guy named Lee Curtis, and that was that.</p>
<p>Margaret told Eric that Darwin&rsquo;s car was home,</p>
<p>which made her even more concerned</p>
<p>because she was sure he hadn&rsquo;t gone far,</p>
<p>and she knew his regular routine.</p>
<p>Nothing local would keep him away from the house for days at a time.</p>
<p>Before hanging up, Eric told Margaret he would call around</p>
<p>and see if anyone had seen Darwin,</p>
<p>and if not, he would start looking for him first thing the next day.</p>
<p>The first person Eric tried to get in touch with was Lee Curtis,</p>
<p>but he wasn&rsquo;t having any luck reaching him.</p>
<p>And so, immediately, the next morning, I went looking,</p>
<p>and I drove downtown, and I was looking around the back alleys.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know. I didn&rsquo;t know what else to do.</p>
<p>By 1999, Darwin and Eric had been best friends for almost a decade,</p>
<p>so Eric knew this was out of character for his friend.</p>
<p>Darwin was smart and independent, but also really social.</p>
<p>He would never skip town without telling people.</p>
<p>As Eric searched the streets, riverbanks,</p>
<p>and back alleys of Idaho Falls, a pit grew in his stomach.</p>
<p>His mind kept wandering to worst-case scenarios,</p>
<p>and he would try to force them out of his head,</p>
<p>convincing himself that Darwin would show up at home</p>
<p>and explain where he&rsquo;d been.</p>
<p>Now, Eric knew Darwin had walked to the bar Wednesday night for trivia,</p>
<p>leaving his car at his mom&rsquo;s house,</p>
<p>but that wasn&rsquo;t unusual for him.</p>
<p>Eric told our reporting team during an interview</p>
<p>that Darwin preferred to walk everywhere.</p>
<p>I mean, I was always kind of concerned that,</p>
<p>you know, Darwin would walk around.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a safe town, but, you know, still, you know,</p>
<p>that late at night, you never know.</p>
<p>He would insist on walking.</p>
<p>Of course, he&rsquo;d been doing this for years.</p>
<p>But on trivia night, it had been storming,</p>
<p>and Eric remembered being concerned for his friend</p>
<p>walking home in the rain after declining his offer for a ride.</p>
<p>They had been drinking during trivia.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t, like, downing shots or anything,</p>
<p>but they were sharing pictures of beer.</p>
<p>So when Eric left, Darwin was definitely buzzed.</p>
<p>But he wasn&rsquo;t too drunk to walk or anything like that.</p>
<p>Eric was coming up with nothing in his search for Darwin.</p>
<p>The panic really settled in when Eric went to Margaret&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>and saw what Darwin had left in his car.</p>
<p>He always kept his snakes in the trunk of his car.</p>
<p>He wouldn&rsquo;t have left without doing something with them,</p>
<p>and we knew that immediately</p>
<p>that there was something terribly wrong.</p>
<p>Yeah, no need to rewind.</p>
<p>You heard the man.</p>
<p>He kept those mother-f***** snakes in his mother-f***** trunk,</p>
<p>which was a total what-the-f***** moment for me</p>
<p>when I heard it, but Darwin was a scientist.</p>
<p>And it was explained to us that he studied snakes and spiders,</p>
<p>so it actually was totally normal for him</p>
<p>to have creepy critters in cages in his bedroom</p>
<p>and in his car.</p>
<p>People around town even called him the Spider-Man.</p>
<p>He just loved talking about all his toxinology,</p>
<p>his experiences with snakes, scorpions,</p>
<p>and other poisonous critters.</p>
<p>People were always fascinated with him.</p>
<p>Margaret couldn&rsquo;t shake the feeling</p>
<p>that something was wrong,</p>
<p>so she decided to go ahead and report Darwin missing</p>
<p>to the Idaho Falls Police Department.</p>
<p>When our team was in Idaho</p>
<p>doing the reporting for this episode,</p>
<p>they met with IFPD Captain Jeremy Galbraith</p>
<p>and Public Information Officer Jessica Clements</p>
<p>to discuss Darwin&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>They said Margaret Vest showed up in person</p>
<p>to report her son missing.</p>
<p>She was very concerned because this was so,</p>
<p>so far out of Darwin&rsquo;s usual behavior.</p>
<p>Darwin&rsquo;s routine was that he would go home.</p>
<p>They lived together and they had a pretty,</p>
<p>pretty solid relationship,</p>
<p>so this was just way out of character.</p>
<p>She knew that Darwin was leaving that night</p>
<p>to go to trivia with Eric,</p>
<p>and she referenced that.</p>
<p>She made a comment, we&rsquo;ve got a note in here</p>
<p>that she talked about Darwin knew that she worried,</p>
<p>so he would come home and actually wake her up</p>
<p>and say, Mom, I&rsquo;m home, and that didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>Captain Galbraith oversees investigations</p>
<p>for Idaho Falls PD today,</p>
<p>but back in 1999, he was a brand new patrol officer.</p>
<p>At the time, I didn&rsquo;t think much of it.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know Darwin Vest better than anybody else,</p>
<p>but I just figured he was around somewhere</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;d show back up.</p>
<p>Darwin was never in trouble with the law,</p>
<p>so officers had no reason to think he&rsquo;d gotten mixed up</p>
<p>with the wrong crowd or would be targeted</p>
<p>by anyone in that way.</p>
<p>So the beginning of the investigation</p>
<p>into his whereabouts focused on interviews.</p>
<p>Bartenders, patrons inside the bar,</p>
<p>good close friends, family, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>It jumped almost immediately</p>
<p>to the detective division from patrol.</p>
<p>Detectives immediately started getting statements</p>
<p>from people while also trying to retrace Darwin&rsquo;s steps</p>
<p>on the route that he most likely would have walked</p>
<p>from his house to the Frosty Gator.</p>
<p>Through interviews with Darwin&rsquo;s sister, Rebecca,</p>
<p>and his business manager,</p>
<p>detectives learned that the day Darwin went missing,</p>
<p>before he went out to the bar,</p>
<p>he had just gotten news that he&rsquo;d been awarded a contract</p>
<p>for a spider trap that he invented.</p>
<p>He designed these traps and they were,</p>
<p>there was different companies</p>
<p>that were bringing them on board to sell.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;d signed a contract with Anderson Lumber</p>
<p>and they were going to carry them in his stores.</p>
<p>And it was, I wanted to say it was a $6,000 contract</p>
<p>that he was going to receive $6,000 of profit,</p>
<p>which was awesome.</p>
<p>And then there was another potential contract</p>
<p>in the works with Fred Meyer</p>
<p>and a couple other things that they had working.</p>
<p>But it was the Anderson contract that was signed that day,</p>
<p>according to the business manager.</p>
<p>Darwin had been working on this trap for a long time.</p>
<p>So it was a big deal</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;d struck a lucrative deal to sell them.</p>
<p>They were a trap for the hobo spider,</p>
<p>a variant of the brown recluse spider</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s prone to getting in people&rsquo;s houses.</p>
<p>Darwin was a national expert on the hobo spider.</p>
<p>And he was so excited about the contract</p>
<p>that he shared the news with his sister via a fax message</p>
<p>that he sent around 3.30 PM on June 2nd.</p>
<p>According to Darwin&rsquo;s mom, he was ecstatic about the deal.</p>
<p>And while going out to trivia</p>
<p>was part of his weekly routine,</p>
<p>that night was also a celebration of sorts.</p>
<p>Bartenders who&rsquo;d been working that night told police</p>
<p>Darwin was his normal self at the Frosty Gator.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d been wearing his usual outfit,</p>
<p>Levi&rsquo;s, a black leather jacket,</p>
<p>a belt with a buckle that had a snake design</p>
<p>and a watch that had a spiderweb design on its face.</p>
<p>Everyone they&rsquo;d talked to so far</p>
<p>made it seem like it was a normal night for Darwin.</p>
<p>But there was one person they hadn&rsquo;t talked to yet</p>
<p>and he could be their most important witness.</p>
<p>And that was Lee Curtis,</p>
<p>the other man Eric and Darwin had been with</p>
<p>at the Frosty Gator.</p>
<p>But again, Lee was kind of hard to get in touch with.</p>
<p>Pretty soon, officers found out</p>
<p>that Lee had actually gone home</p>
<p>to his permanent residence in Utah.</p>
<p>Turns out he was just in Idaho Falls visiting his dad.</p>
<p>Finding out that Lee left town soon after Darwin went missing</p>
<p>made Eric suspicious.</p>
<p>He was an interesting character too,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t know him real well,</p>
<p>but Darwin always kind of seemed,</p>
<p>you know, leery of Lee, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Darwin never would speak negatively about anybody,</p>
<p>you know, but I had the impression that, you know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I just kind of had a feeling</p>
<p>that, you know, somehow Darwin and him</p>
<p>had some sort of issue or something.</p>
<p>Police did eventually get in touch with Lee</p>
<p>who said that he wasn&rsquo;t avoiding police,</p>
<p>but he had a military assignment</p>
<p>that he had to get back for.</p>
<p>Lee agreed to be interviewed</p>
<p>and said that that night when he was out with Darwin,</p>
<p>after Eric left, he and Darwin had one more round of drinks</p>
<p>and then walked a few blocks to another bar</p>
<p>called the Golden Crown for a nightcap.</p>
<p>It would have been around 1 a.m. on June 3rd by this point</p>
<p>because the bar was about to have last call.</p>
<p>But Lee said they each ordered a beer there</p>
<p>and he said that he actually ordered a coffee for Darwin too</p>
<p>so he could sober up a little before his walk home,</p>
<p>but Darwin had rejected the coffee.</p>
<p>According to Lee&rsquo;s statement in police reports,</p>
<p>Lee went to the ATM to get some cash</p>
<p>in order to take a cab home.</p>
<p>And he says when he came back, Darwin was just gone.</p>
<p>Detectives interviewed a bartender at the Golden Crown</p>
<p>who filled in some of the gaps in Lee&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>You see, he said that before Lee went to the ATM,</p>
<p>Darwin had gotten up to use the restroom.</p>
<p>So when he came back and didn&rsquo;t see Lee,</p>
<p>Darwin walked towards the exit.</p>
<p>The bartender said that when Lee came back,</p>
<p>he asked where Darwin had gone</p>
<p>and the bartender told him it looked like he&rsquo;d gone home.</p>
<p>So Lee said he got a taxi and went to his dad&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>So Lee left in a cab, is that confirmed?</p>
<p>Yes, yep, we interviewed the cab driver</p>
<p>and there was another female in the cab as well.</p>
<p>According to police, Lee was also seen arriving home</p>
<p>by roommates who were still awake when he got there.</p>
<p>But there was one major discrepancy with Lee&rsquo;s alibi.</p>
<p>According to Idaho Falls Police,</p>
<p>when officers went to the taxi companies</p>
<p>to confirm Lee&rsquo;s ride home, there was no log of it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s still like this today</p>
<p>since we have all these ride share apps,</p>
<p>but back then, if you hailed a cab,</p>
<p>the driver was supposed to make a log of the ride,</p>
<p>basically the time, the destination, and cost</p>
<p>because the cab company took a percentage of the fare.</p>
<p>So obviously not being able to corroborate this</p>
<p>made police pause because either Lee was lying</p>
<p>or the cab driver was.</p>
<p>So they re-interviewed the cab driver</p>
<p>who finally admitted that he didn&rsquo;t log the ride</p>
<p>because he wanted to keep all the money from the fare.</p>
<p>Despite that discrepancy</p>
<p>and Lee having been the last known person to see Darwin,</p>
<p>he was pretty much cleared of any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Aside from having an alibi,</p>
<p>detectives couldn&rsquo;t find any motive</p>
<p>for why Lee would have wanted to do something to Darwin.</p>
<p>But some people, like Eric, remained suspicious of Lee,</p>
<p>still to this day.</p>
<p>By June 6th, four days since Darwin disappeared,</p>
<p>police were starting to wonder</p>
<p>if something sinister had happened to Darwin</p>
<p>because there was still no sign of him.</p>
<p>So they decided to put out a press bulletin</p>
<p>for the news stations to share his photo</p>
<p>and clothing description on TV.</p>
<p>They also entered his information into NCIC,</p>
<p>the National Crime Information Center,</p>
<p>in case he turned up somewhere else.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when police realized</p>
<p>that a strange call had been made to 911 back on June 3rd.</p>
<p>And they started to wonder</p>
<p>if it could have been about Darwin.</p>
<p>On Thursday afternoon, June 3rd,</p>
<p>a local woman named Dolores called police</p>
<p>and said she&rsquo;d been driving across a bridge</p>
<p>just south of Idaho Falls</p>
<p>when she saw someone in the Snake River.</p>
<p>She said she saw a body floating face down through the river.</p>
<p>The Bingham County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office went out there</p>
<p>and they found a 55-gallon drum, but no body.</p>
<p>They recontacted her and she was adamant.</p>
<p>It was not a 55-gallon drum.</p>
<p>I saw a body.</p>
<p>Where Dolores reportedly saw the body</p>
<p>was near the Shelley Bridge,</p>
<p>which is just downstream from Idaho Falls.</p>
<p>But the thing is, when Dolores made that phone call,</p>
<p>Darwin had not been reported missing yet.</p>
<p>So when there wasn&rsquo;t a body recovered,</p>
<p>police didn&rsquo;t think much of Dolores&rsquo;s report.</p>
<p>The Snake River runs right through downtown Idaho Falls.</p>
<p>Captain Galbraith took our reporting team to the riverbank.</p>
<p>So you can actually see photos of the area</p>
<p>on our website, thedeckpodcast.com,</p>
<p>and on our Instagram, which I&rsquo;ll link to in the show notes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a walkway downtown that hugs the riverbank</p>
<p>and a steep grass hill on either side</p>
<p>without any safety railings.</p>
<p>And the water is within just a few blocks</p>
<p>of the Frosty Gator and the Golden Crown,</p>
<p>which, by the way, both bars are still open today.</p>
<p>So we also have photos of where Darwin spent his last night.</p>
<p>But long story short, the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>went out in boats to retrieve the drum from the water</p>
<p>and they still didn&rsquo;t see a body.</p>
<p>But at some point after days of Darwin not showing up,</p>
<p>they started to wonder if what Dolores saw</p>
<p>could have been him.</p>
<p>They even followed up with her</p>
<p>and she was just as certain as the day she reported it.</p>
<p>What she&rsquo;d seen was a body,</p>
<p>a man&rsquo;s body with dark hair and a plaid shirt.</p>
<p>Now, Darwin did have brown hair,</p>
<p>but he had not been wearing a plaid shirt</p>
<p>the night he vanished.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing, if that was Darwin,</p>
<p>Eric said there&rsquo;s zero chance he fell into the water.</p>
<p>Darwin wouldn&rsquo;t have fallen into the river.</p>
<p>I can tell you that.</p>
<p>I mean, he was around that river his entire life, you know?</p>
<p>But Eric can&rsquo;t say for sure that someone didn&rsquo;t hurt Darwin</p>
<p>and dispose of him in the river or push him in on purpose.</p>
<p>And he felt suspicious of one person in particular</p>
<p>and it was a name that police had heard too.</p>
<p>After the news reports, police had gotten some tips</p>
<p>and one of them was about how Darwin had been the victim</p>
<p>of a brutal assault several years prior.</p>
<p>Darwin Vest had been the victim of a robbery</p>
<p>a couple of years before.</p>
<p>He had been out drinking that night,</p>
<p>was robbed and thrown in a dumpster.</p>
<p>Captain Galbraith asked us to censor the man&rsquo;s name,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ll call him Dane.</p>
<p>According to Eric, back in 1996,</p>
<p>Dane and some other guys had been driving around</p>
<p>and saw Darwin walking home.</p>
<p>They tried to take Darwin&rsquo;s money,</p>
<p>but Darwin stood up for himself.</p>
<p>So they beat him unconscious and stole his money</p>
<p>before throwing him in a dumpster.</p>
<p>Darwin was seriously hurt and ended up pressing charges</p>
<p>and Dane was convicted and went to prison</p>
<p>for the robbery and assault.</p>
<p>So that was one of the theories was that</p>
<p>he had come after Darwin again.</p>
<p>By 1999, Dane had long been out of jail.</p>
<p>So detectives set out to find out where he&rsquo;d been</p>
<p>on June 2nd and 3rd.</p>
<p>Turns out, Dane was living</p>
<p>at the Idaho Falls Community Work Center.</p>
<p>So he was in town,</p>
<p>but the work center was like a halfway house.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t technically locked up,</p>
<p>so he could leave during the day for work,</p>
<p>but he had to return at night</p>
<p>and there were bed check logs that confirmed</p>
<p>Dane had been at the work center late on June 2nd.</p>
<p>It was a structured thing.</p>
<p>Windows were locked and bolted shut,</p>
<p>the front door alarmed, there were regular bed checks,</p>
<p>and he was accounted for all night.</p>
<p>There was no sign he&rsquo;d left his room,</p>
<p>no sign that the window had been hampered with.</p>
<p>Jessica pulled the reports for us</p>
<p>that detailed Dane&rsquo;s alibi,</p>
<p>which were those bed check logs from the work center.</p>
<p>And she said that Dane was accounted for</p>
<p>in bed on June 2nd at 9.45 p.m.,</p>
<p>then 2.15 a.m. and 4.15 a.m.</p>
<p>So if Darwin was last seen leaving the Golden Crown</p>
<p>at 1 a.m. and Dane was accounted for in bed at 2.15 a.m.,</p>
<p>it left a pretty small window</p>
<p>for the two to have crossed paths,</p>
<p>even if Dane had successfully snuck out of the center</p>
<p>in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Detectives had to move on.</p>
<p>And when they did, they explored the theory</p>
<p>that someone could have targeted Darwin</p>
<p>if they found out that he had just landed</p>
<p>a lucrative deal with his spider trap kits.</p>
<p>The issue with that theory, though,</p>
<p>is Darwin hadn&rsquo;t actually gotten his payout yet,</p>
<p>so it didn&rsquo;t make much sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like he was walking around town</p>
<p>with the six grand on him.</p>
<p>As tips stopped coming in,</p>
<p>police dug more into Darwin&rsquo;s background.</p>
<p>They learned that he&rsquo;d gone off to college</p>
<p>and lived in Washington for about a decade</p>
<p>before returning to Idaho Falls to be close to his family</p>
<p>and focus on his spider work, which wasn&rsquo;t just a hobby.</p>
<p>Darwin was an expert on spiders,</p>
<p>snakes, and poisonous plants.</p>
<p>And he was often called upon to testify in court</p>
<p>about spider and scorpion bites.</p>
<p>According to reporting in the Lewiston Tribune,</p>
<p>Darwin worked at a local movie theater to make income.</p>
<p>In all his spare time, he&rsquo;d be out looking for spiderwebs</p>
<p>or out in the forest or desert</p>
<p>looking for snakes or scorpions.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Eric Seneff again.</p>
<p>Every year, he would set up a booth</p>
<p>at the Idaho State Fair.</p>
<p>You could always tell where his booth was</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;d be a huge crowd of people there.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d have specimens, he&rsquo;d have scorpions.</p>
<p>Of course, he was always trying to inform people</p>
<p>about the hobo spider and the dangers</p>
<p>of being bitten by them.</p>
<p>Because a lot of people didn&rsquo;t know that much</p>
<p>about the hobo spider.</p>
<p>It was an introduced species</p>
<p>and it was relatively new to the area.</p>
<p>He was an amazing man.</p>
<p>He really was.</p>
<p>And he was extremely knowledgeable.</p>
<p>We would go on field trips and we&rsquo;d go out in the desert</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d turn over like a piece of plywood</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;d be like a scorpion in there</p>
<p>or a centipede.</p>
<p>And he would rattle off the Latin names for these.</p>
<p>He knew a lot of Latin and he would&hellip;</p>
<p>So he was a fascinating guy to be around.</p>
<p>He was really just a very rare individual,</p>
<p>very much one of a kind.</p>
<p>The more police learned about Darwin,</p>
<p>the less they could find that would make him</p>
<p>the target of a violent crime.</p>
<p>Everyone said he was amazing.</p>
<p>Wonderfully weird was a term people like to use</p>
<p>to describe him.</p>
<p>Darwin&rsquo;s case went nowhere for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>And in June, 2000,</p>
<p>the one year anniversary of his disappearance,</p>
<p>his friends and family held a candlelight vigil.</p>
<p>The lack of new leads made police consider</p>
<p>that maybe Darwin just drank too much</p>
<p>and accidentally fell into the river.</p>
<p>A detective tracked down what the water levels were</p>
<p>the night Darwin vanished.</p>
<p>And it was swollen, nearly at flood stage.</p>
<p>And that matters because when the Snake River</p>
<p>is that high near Idaho Falls,</p>
<p>grates are removed in order to avoid flooding.</p>
<p>In the past, people had fallen in the river</p>
<p>and tragically wound up in those grates.</p>
<p>But they wouldn&rsquo;t have been in place</p>
<p>the night that Darwin went missing.</p>
<p>The Snake River ends up dumping out into the Columbia,</p>
<p>which ends up dumping out into the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>I mean, the Snake River goes along Southeast Idaho</p>
<p>over to Boise, and then crosses into Oregon</p>
<p>and Washington via the Columbia.</p>
<p>With the water level being that high,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of hard to tell exactly</p>
<p>where that could have gone.</p>
<p>If that theory is correct,</p>
<p>where he would have ended up is hard to say.</p>
<p>In 2001, a detective re-interviewed Dolores</p>
<p>about what she saw floating in the river.</p>
<p>Even two years later, she was adamant</p>
<p>that what she saw was a body with dark matted hair</p>
<p>wearing a plaid shirt.</p>
<p>But police weren&rsquo;t able to make any determinations</p>
<p>from her fresh statement.</p>
<p>And Darwin&rsquo;s body hadn&rsquo;t turned up downstream.</p>
<p>So Darwin&rsquo;s case went cold,</p>
<p>and barely any new information came in</p>
<p>over the next few years.</p>
<p>In 2004, Darwin was declared legally dead</p>
<p>with his date of death listed as June 2nd, 1999.</p>
<p>By then, his family had lost most hope</p>
<p>that he was still alive.</p>
<p>But that didn&rsquo;t make it any easier.</p>
<p>They still missed him,</p>
<p>and they still wanted to know what happened.</p>
<p>In 2005, through family members&rsquo; swabs,</p>
<p>Darwin&rsquo;s DNA was put into CODIS,</p>
<p>just in case his body ever turned up somewhere.</p>
<p>A big feature ran in the Times News in July 2006.</p>
<p>The headline read,</p>
<p>Idaho&rsquo;s Spider-Man Still Missing Seven Years After Last Seen.</p>
<p>In that story, police called Darwin&rsquo;s case inactive.</p>
<p>A lieutenant was quoted saying,</p>
<p>until they have reason to believe otherwise,</p>
<p>they lean toward the theory that he fell in the river.</p>
<p>Two more years went by without much talk of Darwin.</p>
<p>But then, out of nowhere in 2008,</p>
<p>police got a strange letter from an inmate</p>
<p>who said that Darwin had been killed.</p>
<p>And he not only knew who did it,</p>
<p>but he knew why, too.</p>
<p>Detectives immediately packed up</p>
<p>and drove the four hours from Idaho Falls to Boise, Idaho,</p>
<p>where the state prison is to interview the inmate.</p>
<p>And he told police another prisoner he knew,</p>
<p>named Todd Briggs,</p>
<p>claimed that Darwin once grabbed his genitals,</p>
<p>and Todd was offended by it</p>
<p>and wanted Darwin dead.</p>
<p>So detectives interviewed this Todd Briggs guy,</p>
<p>who was incarcerated at the same prison.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>Todd didn&rsquo;t exactly have an alibi.</p>
<p>Did Briggs offer up his whereabouts for June 99?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about June 99 exactly,</p>
<p>but he lived in the area, right?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;d mentioned Darwin.</p>
<p>He said that he met Darwin one time in a bar.</p>
<p>It was, you know, Darwin was a fixture.</p>
<p>People knew Darwin.</p>
<p>So he said, yeah, I knew of Darwin,</p>
<p>but I spoke with him for 10 minutes one time,</p>
<p>and that was the only time we ever talked.</p>
<p>It was end of 97, somewhere in 98.</p>
<p>And other people that knew Briggs</p>
<p>and knew them at the time kind of, you know, confirmed that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I remember him mentioning this,</p>
<p>or I remember being around that conversation,</p>
<p>but no, they didn&rsquo;t hang out together.</p>
<p>No, they didn&rsquo;t spend time together.</p>
<p>So Todd basically said the other informant was full of BS</p>
<p>and just wanted time shaved off his sentence,</p>
<p>and he was lying in order to do it.</p>
<p>Todd denied ever hurting Darwin</p>
<p>and said he knew nothing about what happened to him.</p>
<p>Then Todd kind of pointed the finger</p>
<p>back at the other inmate saying,</p>
<p>oh, well, that guy talked about Darwin all the time.</p>
<p>Maybe you should see why he&rsquo;s so obsessed with the case.</p>
<p>By the way, while Todd Briggs</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t exactly ruled out in Darwin&rsquo;s case,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s never been considered a suspect.</p>
<p>But according to court records,</p>
<p>he is in prison for first-degree murder,</p>
<p>two counts of aggravated battery,</p>
<p>attempted escape, and aggravated assault.</p>
<p>And get this, the murder happened in Idaho Falls.</p>
<p>According to a 2002 Time News article,</p>
<p>Todd Briggs was convicted in the murder of Melissa Garcia,</p>
<p>a 25-year-old mother of four.</p>
<p>That article says that he killed Melissa</p>
<p>after she broke off their engagement.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s actually eligible for parole in 2035.</p>
<p>The other inmate,</p>
<p>who was the original letter-writing informant,</p>
<p>is in prison for attempted strangulation,</p>
<p>escape, aggravated assault, and attempted murder.</p>
<p>But police said his statements were all over the place</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t really make any sense.</p>
<p>Plus, his crimes took place much further north in Idaho,</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t have any real ties to Idaho Falls,</p>
<p>so they moved on.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, later that same year, this is 2008,</p>
<p>Dane&rsquo;s name came back up on police&rsquo;s radar.</p>
<p>A woman told police that one of Dane&rsquo;s relatives</p>
<p>had one of Darwin&rsquo;s rings,</p>
<p>and that one time the man had gotten drunk</p>
<p>and said that he and Dane killed Darwin.</p>
<p>Police put both Dane and his relative</p>
<p>through polygraph tests, and they both passed.</p>
<p>But then, around the same exact time,</p>
<p>Eric had someone contact him,</p>
<p>saying something similar about Dane.</p>
<p>I also had some gal in my store.</p>
<p>This has been quite a few years later.</p>
<p>She told me that she had been talking to,</p>
<p>you know, somebody that knew,</p>
<p>but that she had heard from firsthand, you know,</p>
<p>that friends of hers had kidnapped Darwin,</p>
<p>killed him, and buried him out by Caps Crossing, you know?</p>
<p>And, of course, I reported this to police,</p>
<p>and they said, oh, no, she&rsquo;s not credible.</p>
<p>So, I mean, there was all, you know,</p>
<p>there was all kinds of speculations.</p>
<p>Eric was familiar with the area she mentioned,</p>
<p>Caps Crossing, which is just southeast of Idaho Falls,</p>
<p>way out in the sticks.</p>
<p>So, he decided to go look for Darwin&rsquo;s body himself.</p>
<p>I actually went and drove out to Caps Crossing</p>
<p>and kind of just looked around.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Of course, this was, like I say,</p>
<p>this was a decade later, you know,</p>
<p>but I actually did drive out there</p>
<p>and just kind of, you know, poke around.</p>
<p>Did you see anything suspicious?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of, you know, sort of a wide-open area there.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a creek, and I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I just was looking around.</p>
<p>Of course, I don&rsquo;t likely see any bones or anything,</p>
<p>but, I mean, there&rsquo;s deer bones and cow bones,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t see anything that seemed, you know, relevant.</p>
<p>Speculations quieted down after that,</p>
<p>and a few more years went by without any real developments,</p>
<p>except for one wild rumor</p>
<p>that Darwin had packed up and moved to Mexico,</p>
<p>but there was nothing to back that up.</p>
<p>In summer 2011,</p>
<p>Idaho Falls police got another letter about Darwin,</p>
<p>this time from a different inmate</p>
<p>claiming to have information,</p>
<p>but Jessica and Captain Galbraith said</p>
<p>detectives tried to set up an interview with the inmate,</p>
<p>and he never responded after that.</p>
<p>They aren&rsquo;t sure if he changed his mind</p>
<p>about giving a statement,</p>
<p>but all efforts to talk to him since have been unsuccessful.</p>
<p>At the end of 2017, a new police chief in Idaho Falls</p>
<p>assigned Darwin&rsquo;s case to a new detective,</p>
<p>Rome Stifler, and he wanted him to give it a fresh look.</p>
<p>Detective Stifler re-interviewed Dane</p>
<p>and other people who&rsquo;d been possible witnesses.</p>
<p>One interesting thing Detective Stifler discovered</p>
<p>was that on June 3rd, 1999,</p>
<p>an inmate at the work center where Dane was living</p>
<p>actually had escaped the facility</p>
<p>and wasn&rsquo;t found until a year later,</p>
<p>but as far as we know,</p>
<p>nothing ever came of that really in relation to Darwin&rsquo;s case,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not sure if police couldn&rsquo;t track him down</p>
<p>for an interview,</p>
<p>or again, if he just didn&rsquo;t have any ties to Darwin or what,</p>
<p>but either way, it proved to police</p>
<p>that it was in fact possible to escape</p>
<p>from the so-called secure facility</p>
<p>where Dane had been staying,</p>
<p>but it still didn&rsquo;t prove anything about Dane specifically.</p>
<p>There have been some theories in other media</p>
<p>that Dane and Lee Curtis and the other escaped inmate</p>
<p>worked together to set Darwin up for some reason,</p>
<p>but police said that they have no information whatsoever</p>
<p>to back up that rumor.</p>
<p>Police truly have no idea what happened to Darwin,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll admit that they&rsquo;re not really any closer</p>
<p>to solving the case today as they were decades ago,</p>
<p>but they have worked to rule out a lot of different theories,</p>
<p>which sometimes, until the right person comes forward,</p>
<p>is all they can do.</p>
<p>These missing person cases are especially difficult</p>
<p>because if you have a homicide cold case,</p>
<p>you have a crime scene,</p>
<p>you know that they met a tragic end,</p>
<p>a criminal end, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s some kind of nefarious ending that is heartbreaking,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s answers there.</p>
<p>You have something to go back to</p>
<p>to try and connect something to,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s answers in a crime scene, right?</p>
<p>As technology develops,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something more you can do.</p>
<p>With a missing person, you know, it is entirely possible</p>
<p>that nothing nefarious happened,</p>
<p>that it was a tragic accident,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t give you real closure,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t give you answers,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s so you can&rsquo;t just say,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s likely, so we&rsquo;ll sign off on that.</p>
<p>You have to entertain every possibility,</p>
<p>and when you get tips</p>
<p>that maybe something nefarious happened,</p>
<p>you have to look into that.</p>
<p>Family wants answers, life wants answers,</p>
<p>like anyone would.</p>
<p>If it was my brother, if it was my son, my dad,</p>
<p>I would want answers as well,</p>
<p>and we, as a police department,</p>
<p>I look to these families to, you know,</p>
<p>keep it open and follow up on everything we can.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of those tough ones,</p>
<p>especially where, you know, 1951 was when Darwin was born,</p>
<p>so you think about people in that timeframe.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re starting to lose people</p>
<p>that were his peers.</p>
<p>His mother&rsquo;s passed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting tougher and tougher</p>
<p>to find people who were around at that time</p>
<p>who may have remembered Darwin, who may have seen him.</p>
<p>We sure hope that there&rsquo;s answers in this lifetime.</p>
<p>Eric lost hope years ago of ever seeing Darwin again.</p>
<p>It was a big loss.</p>
<p>He was such an exceptional and, you know,</p>
<p>one-of-a-kind person.</p>
<p>I mean, nobody would ever, would be like him again,</p>
<p>you know, so he was, it was a great loss, you know.</p>
<p>I think his devotion to his research</p>
<p>and his love of people and, you know,</p>
<p>just, you know, he touched a lot of lives.</p>
<p>If you know anything about the June 1999 disappearance</p>
