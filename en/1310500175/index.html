    <p>The following is a conversation with Anthony Pompliano, entrepreneur, technology</p>
<p>investor, prolific writer, podcaster, and Twitter user on topics of finance,</p>
<p>cryptocurrency, technology, and economics.</p>
<p>I highly recommend his popular podcast and daily letter called The Pump</p>
<p>Podcast and The Pump Letter.</p>
<p>Quick thank you to our sponsors, Theragun Muscle Recovery Device, Sun Basket Meal</p>
<p>Delivery Service, ExpressVPN, and Indeed Hiring website.</p>
<p>Click their links to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that I&rsquo;ll be having many conversations in the coming</p>
<p>months about cryptocurrency with people of all kinds of backgrounds and worldviews.</p>
<p>Those who are proponents of Bitcoin, like Anthony, Nick Carter, Robert</p>
<p>Breedlove, Alex Glastine, and many others.</p>
<p>And those who are proponents of other cryptocurrency technologies, like Vitalik</p>
<p>Buterin, Charles Hoskinson, Richard Hart, Sergey Nazarov, Silvia</p>
<p>Macaulay, and many others as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not framing this as a debate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m simply looking to explore exciting ideas in the space of technologies that</p>
<p>could very well change human civilization and AGI civilization as well.</p>
<p>I appreciate that some communities are a bit more intense in their style</p>
<p>of communication and others, but I personally am only interested in open</p>
<p>minded, respectful collaboration in exploring ideas.</p>
<p>I personally try to like to approach conversations by considering that I may</p>
<p>be wrong about everything and I&rsquo;m looking to learn.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t engage in groupthink, social signaling, outrage mobs, mocking,</p>
<p>and derision. If you do, I understand, it&rsquo;s just not my thing.</p>
<p>I send you my love either way and hope to meet you in person or some drinks, some</p>
<p>good laughs, and a good conversation one day.</p>
<p>No matter the difference in style or substance, we&rsquo;re all just human after all.</p>
<p>This is an amazing ride we&rsquo;re all on together.</p>
<p>Buy the ticket, take the ride, as Hunter S.</p>
<p>Thompson said, whether you pay for that ticket with Bitcoin, Ethereum, or</p>
<p>the dollar, gold, seashells, a beer, or just a good old smile.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>And here is my conversation with Anthony Pampliano.</p>
<p>You served in the US Army for six years and spent 13 months in Iraq in 2008 and</p>
<ol start="2009">
<li>Can you tell the story of why you joined the army and what were some of</li>
</ol>
<p>the moving difficulties, maybe lasting experiences from the time you served?</p>
<p>Sure. I joined when I was 17 years old, needed my parents to basically sign in</p>
<p>order to join. And I graduated a semester early from high school and thought I was</p>
<p>going to go play football in college and kind of enroll in the spring semester.</p>
<p>And when that didn&rsquo;t happen, basically was working at Chick Fil A and Quiznos.</p>
<p>And I had in my mind, look, this is probably not the path in life that I want.</p>
<p>And so I knew I was going to go to college.</p>
<p>I knew I was going to go play football in the fall, but I had this window of time</p>
<p>and so I walked into a recruiting office and just basically was like, I&rsquo;m assuming</p>
<p>you guys need some help.</p>
<p>And, uh, you know, they gave me the whole pitch and, uh, you know, give you a signing</p>
<p>bonus, you can go jump out of planes and go do all this crazy stuff.</p>
<p>I just said, okay, let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>This was, this was close to the 9 11.</p>
<p>This was in 2006, about five years after.</p>
<p>So what impact, I mean, do you remember 9 11?</p>
<p>What impact did that have on your thinking about this?</p>
<p>So I was, uh, in eighth grade, um, if I remember correctly.</p>
<p>And, uh, I remember, uh, being in school when it happened and, uh, I walked into a</p>
<p>classroom and the entire class, uh, somebody else&rsquo;s class, they were all talking to the</p>
<p>teacher about something.</p>
<p>The second that me and a couple other kids walked in and we got real quiet and the</p>
<p>teacher was like, Hey, go back to your like, homeroom.</p>
<p>And so it was just kind of a weird, like what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Uh, and then next thing I know, they called all the students into the cafeteria.</p>
<p>And this is back before, you know, every classroom really had a television in it and,</p>
<p>you know, cable and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And so when we were there, they basically just said, listen, there&rsquo;s been this, uh,</p>
<p>event that&rsquo;s occurred.</p>
<p>All of your parents are going to come pick you guys up and, uh, they&rsquo;ll explain it to</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>And so to, you know, a kid in eighth grade, you&rsquo;re basically like, what happened?</p>
<p>And so I got home and, uh, and I remember talking to my dad about it and my dad</p>
<p>basically gave me, you know, the, uh, the core American kind of talking points.</p>
<p>Right. Look, somebody from another country came here and tried to kill Americans and</p>
<p>was successful in doing that.</p>
<p>Um, and to some extent he just said, and I&rsquo;m willing to bet, you know, we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to go back after them.</p>
<p>Did that wake you up a little bit to the idea that there&rsquo;s evil out there that, you</p>
<p>know, even just the idea of terrorism for many people that was, um, when it hits you</p>
<p>on your own land, it&rsquo;s a, it really shakes up your mind in some sense, world war two.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why world war two was fundamentally different for Americans than it is for the</p>
<p>people like in Russia and England and France and, uh, in Europe in general is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something about when there&rsquo;s a families, women, children dying on your own</p>
<p>land, that&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>And that was one of the first times in America where like on your, uh, of course</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s Pearl Harbor, but like, this is like in recent history, it&rsquo;s like, they hit us</p>
<p>here, that was like a profound idea.</p>
<p>I think America was very, very good at exporting the violence</p>
<p>elsewhere for a long time.</p>
<p>And, uh, there was this element of, uh, complacency, but also this element of,</p>
<p>uh, um, you know, really just American superiority that doesn&rsquo;t happen here.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And, uh, I think that that woke people up, not only to, uh, you know, to the</p>
<p>idea that other places around the world may not like the American ideals, may not</p>
<p>like democracy and capitalism and, and that, but also, uh, maybe we aren&rsquo;t as</p>
<p>big, tough and secure as we thought we were.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so obviously I think you see the kind of the over rotation with a lot of the</p>
<p>kind of security theater that came after that of almost psychologically, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>make our citizens feel like they&rsquo;re safe, even if the things that we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t necessarily, you know, kind of change that apparatus.</p>
<p>Uh, but on top of that, I think it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>I think that it really woke people up to, uh, extremism around the world.</p>
<p>And, uh, I don&rsquo;t know if necessarily there was a change in the extremism as</p>
<p>much as it just was an awareness thing, right.</p>
<p>How, how many people, you know, kind of drew a line from, was it 92 or 93 with</p>
<p>the world trade center bombing to, you know, deep levels of extremism and hatred</p>
<p>of, uh, kind of the American industrial complex, probably not that many, 2001,</p>
<p>a lot of people.</p>
<p>And so I think that was, you know, again, as a, as a young kid, you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand a lot of this stuff.</p>
<p>You basically just, Hey, somebody came here and tried to kill Americans.</p>
<p>And so, you know, we should go fight back, right.</p>
<p>Was kind of the, uh, the, the response I think that I had.</p>
<p>What role did that have psychologically for you when you then in 2006 join the</p>
<p>army, I mean, this is a very different joining the army than in the time when</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s more peaceful here, you&rsquo;re essentially facing, I mean, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if you see it that way, but you know, there is a war on terror.</p>
<p>And I know that people kind of, uh, criticize that whole formulation</p>
<p>framework of thinking, but nevertheless, you are going to Iraq.</p>
<p>You are going to Afghanistan, you&rsquo;re going to these places and are</p>
<p>fighting these complicated, like, I mean, it&rsquo;s not even clear what you&rsquo;re fighting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I think that there&rsquo;s a couple of key pieces, right?</p>
<p>So one, like what the actual most impactful data points, if you were, or</p>
<p>kind of stories for me, uh, was the Pat Tillman story.</p>
<p>So I played football, uh, in high school and it was going to go play in college.</p>
<p>Um, and seeing, you know, this NFL player who basically just one day said, Hey, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to go and do this instead, uh, and walk away.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know necessarily if it was a, uh, I want to pursue the same story right now.</p>
<p>So he ended up dying.</p>
<p>And so not exactly the, uh, the end result that you want, but I think it</p>
<p>was almost like, uh, he made it okay.</p>
<p>If you were on a certain trajectory in life to go take this detour and,</p>
<p>and to go do it.</p>
<p>Um, but the second thing is I was 17.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re pretty stupid when you&rsquo;re 17, you&rsquo;re pretty naive when you&rsquo;re 17.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so, uh, I almost, um, kind of backed into the deployment because</p>
<p>I signed up, uh, as a, uh, a reserve member.</p>
<p>And so basically the plan was to sign up for the reserves.</p>
<p>I was going to go to basic training, get all the, you know, kind of education</p>
<p>and qualification, I was going to go to college and then after college,</p>
<p>you know, maybe there&rsquo;s a chance that you will go and serve or do whatever.</p>
<p>For me, I ended up getting deployed when I was a junior in college</p>
<p>and we got pulled out of school.</p>
<p>And so at 20 years old, uh, it&rsquo;s not exactly what you thought you were</p>
<p>signing up for, right.</p>
<p>Especially to kind of leave school to go do it.</p>
<p>And then on top of that, uh, I probably had an advantage over most people, both</p>
<p>on the entry to combat and the exit to, uh, kind of a combat situation, which</p>
<p>that was football.</p>
<p>So I always explain that, um, in hindsight, you&rsquo;re in a male dominated</p>
<p>testosterone driven kind of combative sport where it&rsquo;s us first them.</p>
<p>And, and, uh, there&rsquo;s training and, and, uh, you know, injuries and just kind of</p>
<p>all of the things that go into playing a combat sport like football to now they</p>
<p>give you guns, but you still have a uniform on still male dominated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a little bit, you know, more serious in terms of the injuries and,</p>
<p>and, uh, potential deaths and things like that, but also on the exit from that</p>
<p>deployment, most guys I was there with, they&rsquo;re going back to being, you know,</p>
<p>prison guards, police officers working at the lumber yard, you know, just kind</p>
<p>of every day Americans.</p>
<p>And so I had the fortunate ability to go back into, uh, kind of that combative</p>
<p>environment, go back to play football.</p>
<p>And so it was almost this like deescalation on the way out, uh, where</p>
<p>they take your guns away.</p>
<p>We still got a uniform, still male dominated, uh, still combative.</p>
<p>And then eventually you&rsquo;re just a normal citizen.</p>
<p>And so I think that in some weird way, I was, you know, very fortunate</p>
<p>to kind of on the entry and exit, have that experience where other guys did.</p>
<p>So what you were deployed to Iraq, were there any memories, experiences</p>
<p>that changed you or in general, like you&rsquo;re probably a different</p>
<p>man on the other side of it?</p>
<p>How did that time change you?</p>
<p>I think there, there was two main takeaways that I took, right?</p>
<p>So one was, um, not a specific moment, but on multiple occasions, uh, I remember</p>
<p>we were driving down the road and I would look and there would be a 10, 12,</p>
<p>14 year old kid.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ve never seen somebody who literally has hate and disdain in their</p>
<p>eyes, just not necessarily to you personally, just to the uniform, to what</p>
<p>you stand for, it&rsquo;s all this stuff.</p>
<p>When you see it, you see it right.</p>
<p>And I always think of, um, if you&rsquo;ve ever, uh, watched the movie, uh, 12 strong and</p>
<p>in it, uh, they&rsquo;ve got this Afghan, uh, Afghanistan warlord, and he&rsquo;s talking</p>
<p>to a bunch of soldiers and he says, you know, you don&rsquo;t have killer eyes.</p>
<p>You do, you do.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s just like, he can just tell, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s seen so many soldiers.</p>
<p>And so I think that that was a, a memory on a number of occasions where I just saw</p>
<p>young kids and I just said, they hate us.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And, and it&rsquo;s not you personally, it&rsquo;s what you stand for.</p>
<p>But the really big event was, um, when you first get to these combat zones, a lot of</p>
<p>times what will happen is, uh, you basically, your unit teams up with a unit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s leaving and there&rsquo;s a handoff and happens over a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>And so you can imagine almost, you know, 1% of our team goes out with 99% of their</p>
<p>team, then five, 95, 10, 90, all the way till it&rsquo;s 50, 50.</p>
<p>And then eventually it rotates.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s majority of our team and a small number of their team.</p>
<p>And so what a lot of people will explain is the two most dangerous times in war</p>
<p>are actually the first two or three weeks and the last two or three weeks.</p>
<p>When you first get there, you don&rsquo;t know who the people are.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know the terrain, you don&rsquo;t know, you know, kind of the local cultures</p>
<p>and, and, uh, who to look out for, what signs, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And the last two or three weeks is you basically think you survived the</p>
<p>deployment, you&rsquo;re looking forward to going home.</p>
<p>So you become complacent, things like that.</p>
<p>And so we made it through that transition period with no issues.</p>
<p>Uh, but the literally the very first mission, uh, that we went out as a team,</p>
<p>ourselves, a hundred percent, um, there was two separate incidents.</p>
<p>Uh, one was we were driving in the middle of the night and, uh, what we think was a</p>
<p>sniper shot at a truck that I was in, I was standing up outside of it, uh, along</p>
<p>with a, uh, another guy.</p>
<p>And that was kind of just a wake up call again of never been shot at before.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ll never forget, uh, you kind of heard this whiz go by and the guy next to</p>
<p>me was from a rural Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>And he just said, you know, look, I&rsquo;ve never been shot at before either, but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a lot of hunting, get the fuck down.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And so, uh, we kept driving that night.</p>
<p>Um, and, uh, later on in the night, uh, an IED went off, a guy ran over an IED,</p>
<p>uh, who was at the front of the convoy.</p>
<p>And when that IED went off, uh, again, I had never been in a convoy that had been</p>
<p>blown up before, but the training kicks in.</p>
<p>And so immediately every single person starts screaming out IED, IED, and they</p>
<p>started looking and trying to figure it out.</p>
<p>And you realize the United States military did a fantastic job training us before we</p>
<p>went, because in that moment, nobody thought about anything.</p>
<p>You just did what you had been programmed to do.</p>
<p>Um, and so ultimately kind of through the end of that event, uh, there was a US</p>
<p>soldier that ended up dying.</p>
<p>He was, uh, shot in the head.</p>
<p>And, um, when we got back to the base, uh, kind of after that entire event,</p>
<p>I think it just hit us.</p>
<p>We are at war.</p>
<p>And if we make mistakes here, that is the cost of, you know, kind of those mistakes.</p>
<p>And this was somebody who I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Uh, it was somebody who literally showed up, uh, kind of as secondary</p>
<p>support, uh, for our unit and basically, uh, was there to help us.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so it was one of those weird situations where, uh, you have this emotional connection</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s somebody who, uh, shared an event with you, but you didn&rsquo;t know them.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And you learn their name later and you understand that they have a family and</p>
<p>they have young kids and all this stuff.</p>
<p>And so again, as a 20 year old kid, you&rsquo;re kind of processing all this and</p>
<p>you just realize like the gun I have in my arm, my hands, it&rsquo;s real for a reason.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And we better take this seriously.</p>
<p>This is not, you know, let&rsquo;s joking around in kind of the barracks and, you</p>
<p>know, all the things that you would expect, you know, guys you&rsquo;re doing in the army.</p>
<p>So I think that was like the moment where I said, Hey, I&rsquo;m going to learn a lot here.</p>
<p>Uh, and I got to make sure I get home.</p>
<p>And you snap it into the training, but nevertheless, I mean, you&rsquo;re somebody</p>
<p>who thinks philosophically about this world now, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re, uh, very intelligent and things deeply about the world.</p>
<p>So looking back, you mentioned hatred in the 14 year old kids eyes, there&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>So the way you kind of described this whole story is like training kicks in.</p>
<p>This, this shit is serious.</p>
<p>Like this is, uh, you know, there&rsquo;s a reason there&rsquo;s a gun in, in your hand.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a strategic element.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like, you have to get the job done.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a task at hand, but at the same time, if you zoom out, there&rsquo;s a kid who</p>
<p>has hate for you, uh, some of those kids would probably, if they could, would kill</p>
<p>you for the thing you stand for in the uniform.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s bullets flying at you.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s people that some of them you might already care for deeply are dying.</p>
<p>What the hell do you make of that?</p>
<p>Do you think about that?</p>
<p>Does any of that haunt you?</p>
<p>How do you think about the world having witnessed that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>A lot of times when we would talk about it, we were there.</p>
<p>If I was that kid, I would want to kill that person too.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I would have hatred as well.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Imagine if in the United States tomorrow, you and I woke up and there was tanks</p>
<p>rolling down the street from another country and they were basically imposing</p>
<p>their rules on us, whether they thought it was the right thing to do or not, the</p>
<p>soldiers were there and they were doing this, we would probably feel not so great</p>
<p>about it, right.</p>
<p>At kind of a minimum and at a maximum, we&rsquo;d be really, really pissed off.</p>
<p>We would fight back.</p>
<p>And so what you don&rsquo;t understand when you&rsquo;re in the heat of the moment is why</p>
<p>does this person feel this way?</p>
<p>And so what&rsquo;s very weird is, well, what happens if a year ago, US soldiers came</p>
<p>through, they got shot at, they returned fire and they killed that kid&rsquo;s uncle.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be pissed off.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so you just start to understand, like we look at war very black and white.</p>
<p>We look at it very much from a clinical perspective.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to go, we&rsquo;re going to go kind of invade somewhere.</p>
<p>We are the most dominant military in the world.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very good at invading.</p>
<p>And we will crush wherever we invade, but when you&rsquo;re actually on the ground, what</p>
<p>you understand is the humanity of it all.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so what becomes very interesting is pretty much every veteran I know that</p>
<p>comes back, they&rsquo;re some of the largest pacifists in the world.</p>
<p>And I always revert back to Marcus Luttrell, who was a famous Navy SEAL, and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a movie made about him and his story.</p>
<p>He gave a speech one time that I saw and he basically said, listen, if you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>politician, your job is to be the diplomat, do everything you possibly can, not to</p>
<p>send me and my friends anywhere, because when you send us, we&rsquo;re going to bring</p>
<p>hell with us, right.</p>
<p>And understand that is the business that we are in, but every single other person</p>
<p>up until we get sent has a job to do to prevent having to send us.</p>
<p>And I think that ultimately that&rsquo;s where you see a lot of kind of this generation</p>
<p>that has fought in Iraq and Afghanistan that says, listen, maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>running around the world being the police, maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t be going and invading</p>
<p>all these different countries, because when you actually get to see firsthand</p>
<p>what happens, it&rsquo;s just something that we should avoid at all costs.</p>
<p>But if we have to go, or we have to actually send soldiers somewhere, understand</p>
<p>what happens when that occurs.</p>
<p>And you know, the United States is the best in the world at doing it.</p>
<p>Do you think, I&rsquo;m thinking about that kid with the hatred.</p>
<p>Do you think there will always be hatred in the world?</p>
<p>Do you think there will always be hatred?</p>
<p>In the world, do you think, uh, from another perspective, do you think there&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be war always, is that a fundamental aspect of human nature or is that</p>
<p>something we can escape?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So war, I think has like very negative connotations in terms of bullets and</p>
<p>bombs and death and kind of just very morbid type, um, um, understanding.</p>
<p>Conflict on the other hand, I think people look at and say, of course</p>
<p>there will always be conflict, right.</p>
<p>You just can&rsquo;t have billions of people all on the same planet without some</p>
<p>level of disagreement, whether that&rsquo;s a disagreement of ideas, disagreement</p>
<p>over physical, you know, geography, uh, or something else.</p>
<p>And so I think conflict will always exist.</p>
<p>The question is what form does war take moving forward?</p>
<p>And so in my mind, you know, it&rsquo;s starting to look a lot more clinical,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>A lot more drones, a lot less soldiers on the ground, a lot more use of special</p>
<p>forces and kind of these small, highly specialized teams rather than kind of big</p>
<p>mechanical armies.</p>
<p>Um, and then you get into like the information warfare and kind of cyber</p>
<p>warfare and you start to understand that we&rsquo;re at war with a lot of people right</p>
<p>now, right?</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;re necessarily dropping bombs, uh, on their countries.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean we&rsquo;re sending soldiers there, but on a daily basis, we</p>
<p>are engaged in these kind of, you know, cyber battlefields.</p>
<p>And so if that&rsquo;s where war starts to play out, um, it, one changes the tools</p>
<p>and tactics and techniques that, uh, we need to arm our country and other</p>
<p>countries will arm themselves with.</p>
<p>But it also changes the way that we think about war, right?</p>
<p>It seems, it sounds a lot less worrisome if I say, Hey, we&rsquo;re going to go to war</p>
<p>with a country, but by the way, there&rsquo;s going to be no death.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Like that doesn&rsquo;t sound nearly as bad as, Hey, we&rsquo;re going to go send 10,000</p>
<p>soldiers and you know, some percentage of them are going to die on the battlefield.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re going to, you know, basically pipe back videos and articles</p>
<p>saying that American soldiers are dying.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It does seem to be a fundamental difference between the, the Genghis Khan</p>
<p>style, like if I would feel differently if somebody like hand to hand with a knife</p>
<p>murdered my family versus cyber security, why I stole all their data, stole all</p>
<p>their money, stole everything they own, falsified their identity, all that kind</p>
<p>of stuff that those are both traumatic events, but they do seem to be</p>
<p>fundamentally different, but maybe that&rsquo;s actually very narrow style thinking,</p>
<p>because ultimately you have to think about what is life and what&rsquo;s happiness.</p>
<p>And, um, it&rsquo;s like the samurai thinking, I&rsquo;m not sure what&rsquo;s more painful.</p>
<p>If I take it to myself, like, I&rsquo;m not sure what I would rather live through</p>
<p>being stabbed, like to death, or having my identity stolen, all my money stolen,</p>
<p>or maybe reputation destroyed, like with lies or something like that.</p>
<p>That that&rsquo;s very interesting to think about.</p>
<p>If you think about quality of life and all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>well, one&rsquo;s finite, right?</p>
<p>One&rsquo;s the pain ends and the other is kind of a long prolonged, almost torture.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s physical pain versus psychological pain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting to, it&rsquo;s really interesting to think about.</p>
<p>And I think another key piece to this, which I don&rsquo;t have answers to, but,</p>
<p>but there is an element of emotion and rage in the physical violence versus</p>
<p>again, more of that clinical, you know, information warfare.</p>
<p>And so, um, it&rsquo;s really easy to show a battlefield where there&rsquo;s death on both</p>
<p>sides and bombs being dropped and buildings destroyed, um, it fits very</p>
<p>well into propaganda for everyone involved, right, regardless of what side</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re on, when you start talking about cyber warfare, how many times have</p>
<p>we seen a big company get data hacked or information hacked and we all, you</p>
<p>know, read the headlines, maybe throw a tweet out and then move on with our day</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t remember it anymore.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s just very, very different.</p>
<p>I think, uh, in, in the, uh, motion and response that it invokes and people</p>
<p>when they hear about it as well.</p>
<p>Given the conflict, do you think people are fundamentally good?</p>
<p>Are we all sort of like blank slates that could be evil given the environment</p>
<p>or good given the environment, or can we kind of, is there some base that we can</p>
<p>rely on that people, if left to their own devices will be good and trustworthy and</p>
<p>honest, I think you have to separate out intention from action.</p>
<p>So if you talk to some of the most heinous criminals in the world, they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>rationalized their actions, and so you&rsquo;ve got to ask yourself, what is the level</p>
<p>of which they understood what they were doing, that they intended to be malicious,</p>
<p>nefarious, um, and kind of do bad things versus the actual actions themselves.</p>
<p>And so, um, even as a society, you know, if let&rsquo;s say, for example, you were to</p>
<p>walk down the street and you were to murder somebody on the sidewalk, completely</p>
<p>unprovoked, we would look at you and say, you are a, you know, a sociopath, uh, you</p>
<p>have everything wrong with you and that is somebody that we do not want in our</p>
<p>society, and therefore we will levy, you know, the extent of rule of law against</p>
<p>you in order to protect society from you, right?</p>
<p>And you become that monster, that beast, if in the same situation, somebody walks</p>
<p>in your house with a knife and you murder them or you kill them, now we put you up</p>
<p>on a pedestal as a hero, and those are two very, very different responses.</p>
<p>They may be just as morbid, they may be just as violent, uh, in terms of the</p>
<p>actual actions, the intentions, the way it&rsquo;s perceived is very, very different.</p>
<p>And so I think that, uh, as a world, we like a very black and white, clean cut,</p>
<p>you know, good, bad, uh, I think the world&rsquo;s a lot more messy than that.</p>
<p>And I think that, uh, a lot of times when you look at intention, it&rsquo;s hard for us</p>
<p>to tell what somebody&rsquo;s intention is, but I&rsquo;ve looked at a lot of, you know, people</p>
<p>who are both considered very good and also a lot of people are considered very</p>
<p>bad and they sound very similar in terms of the motivations for their actions.</p>
<p>And so I think that it&rsquo;s just a really hard problem that probably doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a perfect solution or an answer.</p>
<p>Do you give much value to the intention or do you think it&rsquo;s better to look at</p>
<p>the results of the behavior, uh, as opposed to the, the underlying ideology?</p>
<p>Underlying ideology, the underlying intention of, of the behavior.</p>
<p>I think that intention gets at the question of like, are people inherently</p>
<p>good or bad, right?</p>
<p>Is I think that they&rsquo;re generally inherently good and the intention is</p>
<p>driving towards the thing that they believe is the best outcome or the best</p>
<p>thing for them to pursue the action.</p>
<p>I think is where we spend most of our time focused on.</p>
<p>Um, and frankly, we actually may be a better society or, uh, kind of kinder</p>
<p>as a humanity to each other if we spent more time looking at</p>
<p>intention rather than action.</p>
<p>Um, but again, you know, if somebody walks down the street and murders</p>
<p>somebody, uh, it&rsquo;s really hard to have a conversation and it may be inappropriate</p>
<p>for us to have a conversation about intention versus, uh, any level of,</p>
<p>of action, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re one of the prominent, I would say even the faces of the, the world</p>
<p>of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, that whole entire world was dive straight in and</p>
<p>ask, uh, do you think, do you consider yourself a Bitcoin maximalist?</p>
<p>I think that the way I really look at it is, uh, I work backwards off of what</p>
<p>is the maximalism that I believe in and the world that I believe in is, uh, kind</p>
<p>of an automated world that is run on these open decentralized protocols.</p>
<p>Uh, and what we ultimately do is we return sovereignty and individualism</p>
<p>and, and kind of, uh, personal responsibility and liberty, uh,</p>
<p>to people over institutions.</p>
<p>And what we end up doing is we end up, uh, kind of taking what has historically</p>
<p>been a very analog or physical world economy and, uh, geographic rule.</p>
<p>And we then kind of put it in the cloud and this digital economy becomes the</p>
<p>prevalent way that we all, uh, conduct commerce, communicate, uh, et cetera.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s less about any one single technology to me, right?</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;s pretty stupid for people to, um, almost in a way, uh, put</p>
<p>an inanimate object up for, uh, you know, some sort of obsession, uh, to me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s much more about the ideals, the ethos, uh, and the most rational, uh,</p>
<p>and likely path to that kind of end result or that world that I think, you</p>
<p>know, is at this point, just a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>So the distinction there, and maybe people don&rsquo;t know the terminology,</p>
<p>maximalism is basically saying, I really think this is a good idea.</p>
<p>Like, uh, you know, if you prefer a certain kind of diet, it could be a</p>
<p>keto maximalist saying like, this is probably, maybe it&rsquo;s not a hundred</p>
<p>percent, but probably the diet that&rsquo;s healthiest for humans kind of thing.</p>
<p>In the same sense, Bitcoin maximalism is saying, you know, of course we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know, there&rsquo;s a lot of uncertainty, but this particular technology seems</p>
<p>to be the best representations of some set of ideals that defines progress</p>
<p>in the future, but you&rsquo;re drawing a distinction between sort of, um, cult</p>
<p>like obsession about an object of any kind, whether it&rsquo;s keto, uh, or, uh,</p>
<p>Bitcoin, and just sort of believing that a technology is the best representation</p>
<p>of a particular set of ideals.</p>
<p>And you believe that sort of, uh, this moving into the cloud, uh, both</p>
<p>the distributed nature of it, but also just the digital nature of it is</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s going to, uh, be a positive step for humanity.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I would even take maximalism a step further, and it&rsquo;s not just the kind</p>
<p>of singular viewpoint of this is the best, it&rsquo;s also, uh, an element</p>
<p>of it&rsquo;s anti everything else.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So, you know, take keto, for example, uh, the keto diet is not only the best diet.</p>
<p>All the other diets are bad.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a very binary view of the world.</p>
<p>Um, I think that what&rsquo;s probably most misunderstood about, uh, let&rsquo;s take</p>
<p>Bitcoin, uh, as a specific example, is that most of the people who are labeled</p>
<p>Bitcoin maximalist, they would be open minded if they believe that something</p>
<p>else came along that was a superior technology or had a, a better, um, kind</p>
<p>of probability of achieving again, that ultimate vision, I think where, uh,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this controversy and kind of clashing of, uh, ideas is that the</p>
<p>Bitcoin community believes Bitcoin is the best way to do that and has very</p>
<p>specific arguments as to why the other things are not right.</p>
<p>And so what ultimately ends up happening, which is very weird in the investing</p>
<p>world, right, it&rsquo;s unlikely that you and I are going to sit down and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to like Apple stock is the best stock and there&rsquo;s no other stock.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s worth anything.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And, uh, and then also it&rsquo;s very weird if you said to me, um, you know, this</p>
<p>stock is worth zero and that&rsquo;s where everything that I own, I&rsquo;ve put on a</p>
<p>short on one single company, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s diversification.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a much more kind of probabilistic thinking in finance in general.</p>
<p>Uh, when it comes to this specific world of cryptocurrency and kind of digital</p>
<p>assets, if you will, uh, is there&rsquo;s two main groups of people who are trying to</p>
<p>build two very, very different things at the onset, but when you unpack it and you</p>
<p>start to spend more and more time on it, you rise, they&rsquo;re actually trying to</p>
<p>accomplish the same thing in two different ways.</p>
<p>So Bitcoin is seen, I think, as a, uh, a digital currency, right?</p>
<p>Kind of the idea that this is going to ascend to become the next global</p>
<p>reserve currency, it&rsquo;s a programmatic kind of digital currency, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also a programmatic kind of transparent, um, money.</p>
<p>And, uh, it&rsquo;s essentially just 180 degrees difference than the inflationary,</p>
<p>you know, non transparent, uh, fiat currencies that exist in the world.</p>
<p>You then look at kind of everything else, right?</p>
<p>And you have a lot of smart contract platforms and various things that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all going after at Ethereum with kind of the world computer</p>
<p>approach, and you can kind of go down the line with all their other</p>
<p>arguments as to what they&rsquo;re trying to build.</p>
<p>I think the big difference just comes down to, uh, innovation versus security.</p>
<p>And when you simplistically look at it via that lens, you actually understand</p>
<p>where both people are coming from.</p>
<p>When you say security, sorry to interrupt, do you mean financial</p>
<p>security or do you mean like literally the, the, the security of the,</p>
<p>of the particular cryptocurrency?</p>
<p>The, the technical security of a blockchain.</p>
<p>So when you look at, let&rsquo;s say, um, Bitcoin versus Ethereum, right?</p>
<p>Bitcoin has decided in that community has decided security is the number</p>
<p>one thing that you have to optimize for.</p>
<p>So decentralization, um, over everything else in terms of transaction</p>
<p>speeds, uh, cost, anything that you could come up with, that is, uh, something</p>
<p>that would be important for a currency.</p>
<p>The number one thing to optimize for is security.</p>
<p>And as we have seen, uh, with a lot of technologies, right?</p>
<p>Facebook&rsquo;s, uh, Libra or now what&rsquo;s known as DiEM is a great example.</p>
<p>Uh, not having decentralization is susceptible to the nation state.</p>
<p>And so a lot of these other platforms and blockchains, uh, they say security</p>
<p>is important, but it&rsquo;s not the most important thing we believe there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>trade off between, you know, a little less security and transaction speed or</p>
<p>composability or whatever it is.</p>
<p>And so take a theorem as kind of the second, uh, largest, uh, community</p>
<p>and blockchain by market cap.</p>
<p>It was created because somebody wanted to, or a group of people</p>
<p>wanted to do something on Bitcoin.</p>
<p>They felt like they couldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>And so they said, Hey, we&rsquo;re going to go create something that has the smart</p>
<p>contracts that we can then go do here.</p>
<p>Again, this is technology, right?</p>
<p>And so the tribalism of like, you&rsquo;re right, you&rsquo;re wrong to me is a little</p>
<p>childish, just in the sense of like the market is going to decide what is most</p>
<p>valuable.</p>
<p>And then when you go inside of that community, like there&rsquo;s a lot of dumb</p>
<p>ideas, people are trying to build around Bitcoin, but there&rsquo;s also a lot of really,</p>
<p>really great ideas that people are trying to build around Bitcoin, same thing in</p>
<p>the Ethereum world. And so what you end up getting, I think, is the tribalism</p>
<p>really comes out of the idea that there&rsquo;s a ticker price that is attached</p>
<p>to all of this, right?</p>
<p>If you go back in history of technology, venture capitalists didn&rsquo;t sit around</p>
<p>the table and yell and scream at each other in this like religious zealot way,</p>
<p>right? Because you bet on one type of cloud computing platform.</p>
<p>And I bet on another one, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the market&rsquo;s going to decide, we&rsquo;re both going to work on and try to</p>
<p>make our successful, uh, here in the world.</p>
<p>I think that the sensitivity and mainly it comes out of the Bitcoin community is</p>
<p>that a lot of this is being funded, not only by venture capitalists and kind of</p>
<p>professional money managers and asset allocators.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also this element of including the retail investor and the public.</p>
<p>And so it, whether it&rsquo;s through ICOs or some other forms of capital raising,</p>
<p>um, there&rsquo;s arguments for it saying, Hey, look, uh, this now gives kind of the</p>
<p>little guy, some sort of access and an ability to do it.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also arguments against it. Some people say, Hey, it&rsquo;s easier to dupe</p>
<p>them and it&rsquo;s easier to run scams and kind of all this stuff.</p>
<p>And so ultimately I think that, uh, crypto is this like arena of ideas.</p>
<p>It is literally the war of attrition and, uh, what will end up happening is 10</p>
<p>years from now, you and I will talk and we&rsquo;re going to say, well, the market said</p>
<p>X was valuable and Y wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And so all of the tribalism from between, you know, here and there, uh, it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, engaging.</p>
<p>Whatever, but ultimately it doesn&rsquo;t really matter because the public is involved.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of personalities.</p>
<p>And so a lot of times we focus on the extreme personalities that do a lot of</p>
<p>maybe, uh, pardon the French shit talking.</p>
<p>And, and so we kind of focus on that, but that&rsquo;s not necessarily a representative</p>
<p>of the communities involved.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about Bitcoin first, and then it&rsquo;ll help us use as a kind of comparison</p>
<p>to Ethereum or whatever else.</p>
<p>So when you think about what is money, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of the first question.</p>
<p>People really kind of go down the rabbit hole on, and ultimately today,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a belief system, right?</p>
<p>And you may believe that one currency has more value over another because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s backed by a certain military or a certain government has a monetary policy</p>
<p>that you believe in or don&rsquo;t believe in.</p>
<p>Um, but ultimately it&rsquo;s a belief system that there&rsquo;s nothing backing this, uh,</p>
<p>other than, uh, a government asks you to pay your taxes in it, right?</p>
<p>And they can have a monopoly on violence, uh, in terms of they can put you in jail.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t pay your taxes, uh, they can, uh, they can, uh, they can</p>
<p>go to other countries and they can invade and do all this stuff.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t always like that, right?</p>
<p>It was historically a layer one technology was gold.</p>
<p>And so gold was a fantastic store of value.</p>
<p>You knew that if you held gold, it wasn&rsquo;t going to be inflated away.</p>
<p>It was sound money was outside the system and no one could create more of it.</p>
<p>And the reason why that&rsquo;s important is because that optimization for store</p>
<p>of value served as the bedrock of the entire stack of, uh, money.</p>
<p>Uh, for 5,000 years. And so the problem with that though, again, trade off between</p>
<p>store of value is it was really hard to transact with, right?</p>
<p>If I came in here and I, and you said, Hey, I want a couple of ounces of gold and I</p>
<p>had a whole bar, I&rsquo;d have to literally shave off the ounces of gold.</p>
<p>Uh, it&rsquo;s heavy to carry around.</p>
<p>If you said to me, Hey, you&rsquo;re in one city, mail it to me, really expensive.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s all these issues with it.</p>
<p>And so ultimately what people said was, well, let&rsquo;s create a second layer on top</p>
<p>of that gold in order to make it easier to transact with it.</p>
<p>That gold in order to make it easier to transact.</p>
<p>And so we created paper claims on the gold.</p>
<p>So, Hey, don&rsquo;t carry around the gold in your pocket anymore.</p>
<p>Put it in a vault or a bank.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to issue a paper claim.</p>
<p>Now you and I can trade these paper claims around.</p>
<p>And at any point, if you want the gold, you just show up and you say, Hey, give</p>
<p>me three ounces of gold or two bars or whatever.</p>
<p>And so that actually made the store of value.</p>
<p>It was allowed that to be the anchor and kind of the most important part, the</p>
<p>security of your, of your purchasing power, but now it became easier to transact.</p>
<p>And then eventually we built layers even on top of that.</p>
<p>So everything from electronic money, uh, kind of electronic UCIPS, all the way</p>
<p>to credit and other systems on top of that gold 1971 comes around and obviously</p>
<p>we D peg from that gold, right?</p>
<p>And it was a temporary measure at the time.</p>
<p>We ended up not going back to it.</p>
<p>And so what you moved or transitioned from was sound money, which was outside</p>
<p>the system, no one could create more to now the government had full control.</p>
<p>They could create as much as they wanted to.</p>
<p>They tried to be responsible and disciplined, but obviously hard to do.</p>
<p>Sometimes we&rsquo;ve been really good at it.</p>
<p>Sometimes we&rsquo;ve been less good at it.</p>
<p>And then you go around the world and some countries have absolutely sucked</p>
<p>at it and some have been good at it.</p>
<p>And so when you look into the Bitcoin world, I think that when you look at</p>
<p>this optimization for security, similar to gold store value, people hold it.</p>
<p>Purchasing power has gone up a lot year over year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a 200% year over year compound annual growth for over a decade.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And so you measure this in kind of the us dollar exchange price, et cetera.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s still a lot of people who will yell and scream about it&rsquo;s slow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s costly, right?</p>
<p>All the things around those transactions that are obstacles or challenges.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s basically two schools of thought, and this is where we</p>
<p>kind of get into the bifurcation.</p>
<p>Some people just said, Hey, this technology is antiquated.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t use it.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>Uh, and so what we&rsquo;re going to do is we&rsquo;re going to go build something new.</p>
<p>And so you go get, you know, kind of all of the various versions there.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin community says, no, just like gold had paper claims and other</p>
<p>things built on top and layer two, three, four, five, we&rsquo;re going to do that here.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;ve already started to build kind of this layer two where</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easier to transact.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cheaper, it&rsquo;s faster, et cetera.</p>
<p>And so I actually think that both of those worlds are going</p>
<p>to coexist in the future.</p>
<p>The big question is just which one has more importance, right?</p>
<p>So again, get out of binary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just probabilistically.</p>
<p>And so my personal belief is that the security that the store of value</p>
<p>component as the bedrock for a monetary system is essential, right?</p>
<p>Like that is the most important thing because you can always improve</p>
<p>the other components, but you can&rsquo;t go back and fix that kind of core piece.</p>
<p>So money, money&rsquo;s a, an idea that we all it&rsquo;s like an emergent</p>
<p>idea that we believe in.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying that security is one of the most fundamental catalysts or fuels</p>
<p>for that idea to sort of take hold and be stable and sort of take over the world.</p>
<p>The other stuff is really nice to have, but if you don&rsquo;t have the security,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to, like, it&rsquo;s not going to spread in the viral</p>
<p>sense in, in our human brains.</p>
<p>Well, and especially in light of the kind of the macro economy, right?</p>
<p>So like, what&rsquo;s so fascinating about the last 12 months is, um, in</p>
<p>investing in general, the best returns, right?</p>
<p>I kind of put that in air quotes a little bit is something that is different</p>
<p>than everything else and right.</p>
<p>So being different and wrong just means you&rsquo;re an idiot, right?</p>
<p>Being different and right means that that&rsquo;s where kind of the outsize returns</p>
<p>are. And so if you look around the world at currencies today, they&rsquo;re all the same.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all inflationary, unlimited supply controlled by a government done and</p>
<p>decisions made in a very non transparent process.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;ve watched is the manipulation of all of those currencies</p>
<p>over the last 12 months in direct contrast to that is this thing, Bitcoin,</p>
<p>which is outside of the system, has a finite supply, transparent and programmatic</p>
<p>monetary policy. And so when you see those two systems kind of, um, in comparison</p>
<p>to each other in the United States, there&rsquo;s a lot of people who say the dollar</p>
<p>works great for me. I can go to the ATM, I can get out physical cash.</p>
<p>If I want to swipe a card, I could do that.</p>
<p>My money in my bank doesn&rsquo;t lose 50% of its value in a day in terms of</p>
<p>purchasing power. Like the dollar&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>When you go to other countries, that might not be the case.</p>
<p>And so I do think that there&rsquo;s a kind of a relative analysis that goes on here.</p>
<p>If you compare Bitcoin to the dollar, there&rsquo;s all kinds of arguments to make</p>
<p>that the dollar is better as a medium of exchange today.</p>
<p>But if I go and I tell you, well, what about in these kind of extreme examples</p>
<p>of Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Turkey, et cetera.</p>
<p>And so I think that that&rsquo;s kind of one perspective to view this through is</p>
<p>security versus all of the innovative components of a medium of exchange, et</p>
<p>cetera. The second thing, though, that I think is really important is</p>
<p>around censorship.</p>
<p>And so when you look at, again, every currency in the world today, every</p>
<p>single financial service, they&rsquo;re highly susceptible to censorship.</p>
<p>And actually, I would argue the United States is in the business of</p>
<p>censorship in terms of how many countries around the world do we sanction</p>
<p>and cut them off in either a minimal or a very material way from the global</p>
<p>financial system. So when you define it, when you talk about censorship,</p>
<p>do you mean just the censoring your ability to operate freely in the world?</p>
<p>Well, look at it a little bit differently, which is that the United</p>
<p>States has kind of the American superiority because we have the bombs,</p>
<p>the bullets, the soldiers and that military might.</p>
<p>We basically impose our will around the world.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a very strong argument to be made that there are certain</p>
<p>countries around the world that are being sanctioned, that the people</p>
<p>of those countries did nothing wrong. Now, the governments are bad, right?</p>
<p>In terms of the way that you and I would look at democratic rule or</p>
<p>communism or whatever it is, but the people are being hurt as well.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a whole group of people who would just argue, listen, we</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t hurt anyone at the expense of punishing one person or a group</p>
<p>of people. There&rsquo;s other people argue against that. But I do think that</p>
<p>if you really kind of zoom out and you say, I&rsquo;m going to take myself out</p>
<p>of the Western worldview, and I&rsquo;m simply going to look at this as we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>all part of the human race, it&rsquo;s censorship. And there might be an</p>
<p>argument for censorship, but there also might be an argument against</p>
<p>the censorship. And so what Bitcoin does, as that specific kind of</p>
<p>payment network is it says anyone in the world with an internet connection,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care where you were born, what language you speak, what</p>
<p>religion you are, your wealth status, your education status, none of it</p>
<p>matters. If you have an internet connection, you&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>care. If you have an internet connection, you can plug into this</p>
<p>monetary system. And you can move value around the world to anyone</p>
<p>else without asking for permission. And in the United States, we</p>
<p>basically have that ability in the US dollar kind of traditional</p>
<p>banking system, I can pretty much send money to almost anyone I want</p>
<p>unless they&rsquo;re a really bad person that&rsquo;s on some list or something.</p>
<p>Most people in the world don&rsquo;t have that capability. And so what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re essentially doing is you&rsquo;re democratizing access to a true store</p>
<p>value, and a medium of exchange, right. And so what you see in many</p>
<p>of these countries is that when their currency starts to fail, the</p>
<p>first thing that a government or a group of people in power and</p>
<p>influence do is they lock the citizens into the currency with</p>
<p>capital controls. Why? Because if you let them out, it exasperates</p>
<p>the problem. And so now what we&rsquo;re seeing is we basically are giving</p>
<p>a tool to billions of people around the world that is a peaceful</p>
<p>protest. Right? You and I had no say at all. When not only the</p>
<p>Federal Reserve and elected officials here in the United</p>
<p>States, but central banks around the world over the last 12 months</p>
<p>decided to create trillions of dollars and injected into the</p>
<p>monetary system. Right? They have arguments, and some of them are</p>
<p>very good arguments as to why they should do that. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to mitigate short term pain. Long term, they&rsquo;ll figure</p>
<p>out the other issues, right? They have very kind of elaborate and</p>
<p>well articulated kind of viewpoint as to why they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing it. But you and I had no say. And so when you start to</p>
<p>look at, we have a very small group of people in this world,</p>
<p>both in our country and in countries around the world that</p>
<p>make these decisions that have very, very far reaching kind of</p>
<p>impact. And on top of that, in many cases, there&rsquo;s actually not</p>
<p>that much kind of accountability. Because usually</p>
<p>these are not elected officials who are making some of these</p>
<p>decisions, these are appointed. And you can argue that, hey, we</p>
<p>elected somebody who appointed them. But at the same time, that</p>
<p>accountability isn&rsquo;t quite there. And so I think ultimately,</p>
<p>when you just back out, you say, you know, what is Bitcoin? Why</p>
<p>is it important to the world? It is giving access to anyone in</p>
<p>the world with an internet connection to a store of value</p>
<p>and a monitoring network that allows them to peacefully</p>
<p>protest and to opt out of a system that pretty much is not</p>
<p>working for majority of people in the world.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s moving the power from these centralized places,</p>
<p>sometimes unelected to the individuals and to the people.</p>
<p>So the dollar does seem to work for Americans and for many</p>
<p>people in the world. But you kind of have a vision, you paint</p>
<p>a picture of a future where potentially we move to</p>
<p>cryptocurrency. So what kind of trajectory do you see where</p>
<p>Bitcoin can become the main currency in the world, or at</p>
<p>least cryptocurrency become the main way of storing value in the</p>
<p>world and basically overtake the dollar?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I always go first to we don&rsquo;t need to have competition</p>
<p>like in terms of like a direct competition between the dollar</p>
<p>and Bitcoin, right? If you look at most technologies in the</p>
<p>world, the really valuable ones are actually market expanding</p>
<p>technologies, rather than simply just market share stealing</p>
<p>technologies, right. So if you look at Uber, for example, Uber</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t just say, Hey, I&rsquo;m gonna go take out all the taxis,</p>
<p>right? It actually drastically expanded the market for people</p>
<p>now there&rsquo;s literally millions of people in the United States</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t have cars because they use Uber, right. And so I think</p>
<p>that Bitcoin is very similar in that, yes, there is a component</p>
<p>of medium of exchange, in terms of the dollar. But also there is</p>
<p>this component of just store value assets in general. And so</p>
<p>when you start to look at Bitcoin, specifically, I think</p>
<p>that what you&rsquo;re seeing is you&rsquo;re seeing a generational gap,</p>
<p>where young people say, I grew up with a phone in my hand, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>digitally native, the whole idea of going to the bank and</p>
<p>sending a wire, or going to an ATM and getting physical cash is</p>
<p>an antiquated idea in their mind, right? I one time asked my</p>
<p>brother, he&rsquo;s 24 years old. And I said, Hey, how do you send</p>
<p>money to your friends? And he gave me one answer, which I</p>
<p>expected, which was Venmo. And the second answer, I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>expect he said Uber. I said, How do you send money via Uber? He</p>
<p>said, Well, we get in a car together. And at the end, we</p>
<p>split the ride. And so again, you and I have probably both</p>
<p>done that. But I never thought of it as a way to send money to</p>
<p>each other. And so it is a psychological difference between</p>
<p>even me, who&rsquo;s only, you know, a decade older than him or so,</p>
<p>and his peer group. And so I think as we&rsquo;re watching kind of</p>
<p>Bitcoin continue this ascent, ultimately, what we&rsquo;re seeing is</p>
<p>an entire generation of kids are saying, Listen, if I look at</p>
<p>financial assets across the board, I have stocks, I have</p>
<p>bonds, I have currencies, and I have commodities, I know that</p>
<p>bonds, from a real rate return perspective, is flat to</p>
<p>negative, right? I&rsquo;m gonna make no money on this, because I have</p>
<p>a belief that my dollar is being devalued. And actually, what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re starting to see is, again, the internet has broken down</p>
<p>these walled gardens and kind of these centralized hubs of</p>
<p>information, in that if you were to look at, let&rsquo;s say the stock</p>
<p>market, from 1971 to today, in dollar terms, it&rsquo;s a 45 degree</p>
<p>angle right up into the right, right, you know, it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>seven, 810% growth, every year, it&rsquo;s amazing, just get invested</p>
<p>in the stock market, and you&rsquo;ll make money over a long period of</p>
<p>time, regardless of the dips along the way. If you do not</p>
<p>make that same stock market in gold, the stock market is down</p>
<p>since 1971. And so is it so much that the stock market is accruing</p>
<p>true value? Or is it that the underlying currency in which it</p>
<p>is denominated in is being devalued? Right? And I was being</p>
<p>devalued in a very disciplined way, right, in terms of it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>like it went 50% devaluation in a short period of time, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still being devalued. And so I think that people are waking up</p>
<p>to this idea that a traditional 6040 type global portfolio</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work anymore, right? 40% of it in bonds is just not going</p>
<p>to get it done. And so when you start to look at this, people</p>
<p>first look at Bitcoin via two main ways, in my opinion, they</p>
<p>look at it one as a store value, should I actually go and put</p>
<p>some of my wealth there use it as a savings technology, right?</p>
<p>We ask people in the traditional world, if you&rsquo;re a teacher, a</p>
<p>fireman, an accounting, you know, mid level manager, we say,</p>
<p>hey, go do your job, be best in class as a fireman or as a</p>
<p>teacher. And then Oh, by the way, you have to be a</p>
<p>professional investor as well. Because if you just put your</p>
<p>dollars in your bank account, you&rsquo;re literally going to have</p>
<p>your wealth devalued away over time. So you can&rsquo;t just save you</p>
<p>have to invest. That is a really tall task for people, they have</p>
<p>a hard enough time just doing their job, right? Taking care of</p>
<p>their family, right? Now they got to go be an investor. So I</p>
<p>think savings technology for Bitcoin standpoint is, if you</p>
<p>buy satoshis or Bitcoin, over time, it will increase from a</p>
<p>purchasing power standpoint, because there&rsquo;s a fixed supply</p>
<p>and demand continues to rise. But then you start to look at</p>
<p>well, what other assets do people put in their portfolios,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s art, it&rsquo;s real estate, precious metals, or</p>
<p>something else. Most of those assets are not because people</p>
<p>actually think that they&rsquo;re going to go up in value over</p>
<p>time, they&rsquo;re using the store of value. Right? The reason why</p>
<p>somebody buys gold is because the store of value, right</p>
<p>historically, that&rsquo;s a narrative driven type asset, though,</p>
<p>right? We tell people it&rsquo;s scarce, we tell people that it</p>
<p>is a store of value. When you look at it, though, we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know how much gold exists in the world, we have a good estimate,</p>
<p>right? But we don&rsquo;t actually we can&rsquo;t prove how much there is.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know how much is coming out of the ground every day.</p>
<p>Again, great, fantastic estimate. But we can&rsquo;t prove it.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know what the total supply and that&rsquo;s what you mean</p>
<p>by narrative driven, we can&rsquo;t really prove it, like</p>
<p>mathematically, we you I and everyone else in the world has</p>
<p>lived in a narrative driven world for the last couple of</p>
<p>decades, right? And what the internet and digital technologies</p>
<p>have done is it opened up the possibility and the desire from</p>
<p>people to have a world now where I can validate things. So when I</p>
<p>see that headline, I want to see you say whatever happened to the</p>
<p>news, if you&rsquo;re the subject of the news, rather than have</p>
<p>somebody else tell me the story. If I see that you say something</p>
<p>is scarce, prove to me that it is scarce. And so I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of a psychological shift, the younger generation is</p>
<p>starting to understand because ultimately, you and I probably</p>
<p>grew up in a world where parents could tell us the story. And we</p>
<p>just believed it. You know, dad or mom says it must be true. If</p>
<p>my brother heard a story, what does he do? He goes to Google</p>
<p>and he looks it up. Randy comes back and usually tells my</p>
<p>parents, oh, you got the story wrong, right. And so I think</p>
<p>that that that provability or that that validation ends up</p>
<p>becoming really, really important. And so, you know,</p>
<p>look at something like gold, I think that people are</p>
<p>drastically underestimating the shift that&rsquo;s underway right now.</p>
<p>Gold is one down in value since April, or I&rsquo;m sorry, August of</p>
<ol start="2020">
<li>And so in a timeframe where central banks have had</li>
</ol>
<p>historic quantitative using literally $6 trillion in the</p>
<p>United States, the one asset that historically has been the</p>
<p>best store of value and has, you know, in 2008 financial crisis</p>
<p>hit an all time high based on the government response has</p>
<p>actually suffered for a main part of this financial crisis.</p>
<p>You then look at central banks around the world who have been</p>
<p>very large holders of gold for a long time and net buyers on a</p>
<p>monthly basis. For multiple months, over the last six</p>
<p>months, they&rsquo;ve been net sellers of gold. And then you</p>
<p>start to look at jewelry demand. So the actual non</p>
<p>monetary value of gold, and that demand for gold jewelry peaked</p>
<p>in 2013, and has continued to fall since. And so what you</p>
<p>start to say to yourself is take just the asset of gold, which</p>
<p>about $10 trillion market cap, and you say, Okay, well,</p>
<p>jewelry demand continues to fall, even if it&rsquo;s at a slight</p>
<p>rate, but it&rsquo;s continues to contract. You have central</p>
<p>banks that now at some times are net sellers and sometimes net</p>
<p>buyers, right? So okay, again, contraction there. And then from</p>
<p>the investment standpoint, the actual price, the daily price of</p>
<p>this continues to fall, which is a signal that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>contracting demand from an investment perspective. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>93% of all use of gold, only 7% of it&rsquo;s used for actual</p>
<p>technology and metal conduction and things like that. And so</p>
<p>you have a $10 trillion asset that it appears and again, maybe</p>
<p>data changes, and I&rsquo;ll change my mind and other people change</p>
<p>their mind, but it appears is on the decline. And so if that</p>
<p>happens, you&rsquo;re going to get the contraction of a $10 trillion</p>
<p>asset, where&rsquo;s all that value go. And what you&rsquo;re seeing is at</p>
<p>the same time that that asset is contracting, you&rsquo;re also seeing</p>
<p>a massive influx from not only retail investors, not only kind</p>
<p>of the wealthy and the elite, but also from financial</p>
<p>institutions, corporations, pension funds, etc. into this</p>
<p>kind of digital sound money.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying that there&rsquo;s a kind of shift from gold to</p>
<p>Bitcoin, because they have a lot of the same properties, except</p>
<p>one is in the physical space, the other is in the digital</p>
<p>space. So do you see like central banks, quietly</p>
<p>potentially switching out from sort of gold to Bitcoin, like</p>
<p>naturally just doing is seeing a pattern that you&rsquo;re referring</p>
<p>to now, but more drastically into the future, where there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a complete shift,</p>
<p>if you line up the gold community and the Bitcoin</p>
<p>community next to each other, they&rsquo;ll agree on all the</p>
<p>problems that they that they see in the world, right? They&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>actually agree on the solution that sound money is the solution</p>
<p>where they differentiate is the gold communities believes that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the analog application of sound money, right? The physical</p>
<p>gold, that is the solution. The Bitcoin community believes the</p>
<p>digital application of sound money, Bitcoin, can you define</p>
<p>sound money, by the way, someone is just outside the system, and</p>
<p>no one can create more of it. So nobody controls it. This is</p>
<p>scarcity is fundamental. Exactly why scarcity important in money?</p>
<p>I think scarcity just has this very high correlation to value</p>
<p>across all assets, not just money, right? Money happens to</p>
<p>be the unit of account that we use in terms of daily commerce.</p>
<p>But whether it is, you know, as we&rsquo;re seeing now, sneakers, or</p>
<p>you know, whatever it is, scarcity, ultimately, is that</p>
<p>signal of value, I think, and that&rsquo;s just been the way that</p>
<p>humans derive value for literally, you know, thousands</p>
<p>and thousands of years. Yeah, I gotta say, that&rsquo;s my view on</p>
<p>life and love in general, is scarcity is what makes it</p>
<p>valuable. People talk about immortality.</p>
<p>You know, I would like to be immortal, but it does, it does</p>
<p>seem that when you let go of the finiteness of life, I feel like</p>
<p>that meals and the experiences you have get devalued</p>
<p>significantly, like, the longer you live, the less value there</p>
<p>are in infinity, if you live forever, I worry that all the</p>
<p>meaning will dissipate. And the same thing with love, I think</p>
<p>criticism of sort of dating culture and all that kind of</p>
<p>stuff. Like I haven&rsquo;t had shocking revelation that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never been on a tinder date or any of those things. I believe</p>
<p>that scarcity in dating and interaction is like, intensifies</p>
<p>the value of when the interactions do happen. So, when</p>
<p>they like when love does happen. And so in that sense, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something magical about scarcity in the more subjective</p>
<p>psychological social world, as well. And perhaps money is just</p>
<p>another version of that, right? It&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s all about the</p>
<p>stories and ideas we tell ourselves.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re actually more interconnected than you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>giving it credit for, right? Which is, what is money? Money</p>
<p>is time, ultimately, right? The pursuit of the acquisition of</p>
<p>money, right, of whether it&rsquo;s a currency or true money, is</p>
<p>because that should give you more time, right? And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what would give you more time. And so one of my favorite</p>
<p>movies ever is, and it&rsquo;s funny, because Justin Timberlake is in</p>
<p>it, is this movie in a lot of me, I lose most people at that</p>
<p>point, in time, in time. And basically, the premise of the</p>
<p>movie is that everyone has a clock that is embedded into</p>
<p>their arm. And so if you go to work, you basically put your</p>
<p>arm underneath when you leave, and there&rsquo;s time that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>deposited into your clock. And if your clock ever hits all</p>
<p>the arrows, you&rsquo;re dead, you die on the spot. And so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a number of scenes where people are basically running, you know,</p>
<p>to get to you, and I give you a little bit more time so that</p>
<p>you can get to work on Monday, and then you work to acquire</p>
<p>time. And so basically, time becomes this currency. But what</p>
<p>becomes very fascinating about it is there are sections in</p>
<p>society, where literally, there&rsquo;s physical places, if you</p>
<p>only have, let&rsquo;s say, 72 hours or less, you&rsquo;re allowed to go to</p>
<p>Section One. Section Five, though, is because you have</p>
<p>years and years and years on your clock. And in this movie,</p>
<p>everyone at the age of 25 freezes from a biological aging</p>
<p>standpoint. So everyone stays the same, but you may have lived</p>
<p>for 1000 years. And so what becomes so fascinating about it</p>
<p>is that rich people have time, poor people do not have time.</p>
<p>And so in it, Justin Timberlake, the main character at one</p>
<p>point, essentially acquires a bunch of time, and he&rsquo;s able to</p>
<p>go to one of the higher levels. And now he&rsquo;s attending all these</p>
<p>galas and, you know, poker nights and all this stuff. And</p>
<p>one of the first things that he learns is that in the lower end</p>
<p>of society, everyone is running everywhere at all times in the</p>
<p>movie, because time is so finite, and it is so scarce.</p>
<p>And so therefore, why would I walk down the street, I must run</p>
<p>down the street. In the highest level of society, no one runs</p>
<p>anywhere. And in fact, if you run, you are seen as lower</p>
<p>class. Yeah, because wealth is time. And so that movie is, you</p>
<p>know, it&rsquo;s got a ton of kind of things that you can pull out of</p>
<p>it, but to me is the perfect epitome of money is time. And so</p>
<p>when you start to think about the acquisition of money, right,</p>
<p>it goes to this whole idea of time billionaire. And I know</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s probably a lot of people who&rsquo;ve heard about this</p>
<p>already. But if you think of a million seconds, it&rsquo;s about 11</p>
<p>days, a billion seconds is 31 years. And so if I said to</p>
<p>somebody, you have to switch lives with Warren Buffett,</p>
<p>would you do it? Some people would say, Sure, that&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>their initial reaction. But you got have to be you know, 92</p>
<p>years old, is the money worth the lack of time? Most people</p>
<p>would say no, right? And there&rsquo;s this guy, Graham Duncan, who</p>
<p>really articulated this well. And ultimately, what ends up</p>
<p>happening is you rest time is more valuable than the money.</p>
<p>But the you acquire the money to gain more time. And the reason</p>
<p>is valuable is because of the scarcity of time. We currently</p>
<p>have the by the biology, the physics means that this is not</p>
<p>just the narrative we tell ourselves, maybe it is, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know, but it feels like pretty sure we&rsquo;re mortal. And in that</p>
<p>sense, the scarcity there gives value to time, it&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>to think about all the thought experiments here of if that</p>
<p>could actually be on the economy, if you can actually</p>
<p>convert time in a frictionless way to money.</p>
<p>Well, and if you start to pull on this a little bit and say,</p>
<p>okay, a young person today, let&rsquo;s say somebody in their</p>
<p>20s, has about 2 billion seconds left in their life, right, kind</p>
<p>of 60 years, give or take, based on life expectancy. They</p>
<p>usually, until they start to understand this concept, think</p>
<p>of wealth in dollar terms. But dollars are being devalued. And</p>
<p>so you know, a million dollars doesn&rsquo;t get you what it used to</p>
<p>get, right is kind of an old adage. And so what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re pursuing something that ends up losing value. And</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s the constant rat race, it&rsquo;s how do I constantly try to</p>
<p>get more? How do I get more dollars? How do I get more</p>
<p>dollars? Because even if I say to myself, you know, I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to retire when I get $100,000. When I get the $100,000, the</p>
<p>$100,000 five years from now doesn&rsquo;t buy me what I thought it</p>
<p>did. So now I need 500,000 or 200,000 or a million or whatever</p>
<p>the number is. And so ultimately, what ends up</p>
<p>occurring is that the Bitcoin community and many people in</p>
<p>kind of this idea of sound money is you want to be able to</p>
<p>acquire an asset that not only will hold the value, right, the</p>
<p>store of value over time, but it will actually appreciate over</p>
<p>time. And so when you look at something like Bitcoin against</p>
<p>the dollar against other types of assets, all of these assets</p>
<p>are down compared to Bitcoin, right? Now, some of that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>in the early days of kind of the pricing of an asset, you go from</p>
<p>very small to something much larger. But now what you start</p>
<p>to look at is well, if you have a finite supply of something,</p>
<p>what ends up happening is people begin to value it more. And so</p>
<p>in a world where dollars are infinite, and other fiat</p>
<p>currencies are infinite, Bitcoin becomes very, very interesting,</p>
<p>very special, and something that is very aspirational. And so I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re starting to see people say,</p>
<p>wait a second, this is something where that finite, secure store</p>
<p>of value is essential to wealth generation and preservation over</p>
<p>a long period of time.</p>
<p>And if Sam Harris is right, that free will is an illusion. This</p>
<p>is really interesting to think about. Maybe time is a kind of</p>
<p>blockchain, because you can&rsquo;t change anything. And then the</p>
<p>physical space time of the universe is a ledger. So maybe</p>
<p>it won&rsquo;t be Bitcoin that replaces gold, maybe it&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>time, once we crack open that, in fact, the universe is fully</p>
<p>deterministic. So maybe that&rsquo;s what like Eric Weinstein is</p>
<p>afraid of, once you figure out the theories of everything of</p>
<p>physics, we&rsquo;ll be able to then start trading, create a market</p>
<p>out of like the very fabric of reality. And that way break it.</p>
<p>Well, if you look at infinite inflationary type currencies,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do that, right? Because it constantly is losing</p>
<p>value. When you look at a finite asset, again, that has the</p>
<p>provability of the actual finite element to it. Ultimately, the</p>
<p>wealth is that marketplace. Yeah. And so, you know, I always</p>
<p>kind of try to highlight for people, the top 55% of Americans</p>
<p>understand something that the bottom 45% don&rsquo;t, they invest,</p>
<p>right, the bottom 45% consume the top 55% invest. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why we have a wealth inequality gap. And it continues to get</p>
<p>wider and wider and wider is because the people who are</p>
<p>holding the devaluing assets, and saving are watching their</p>
<p>wealth be devalued away. And there&rsquo;s arguments and</p>
<p>controversy over how fast that&rsquo;s happening, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening. The people who are holding the assets that have any</p>
<p>level of scarcity, right, real estate may not be finite, but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s scarce, right? Art may not be finite, but it&rsquo;s scarce. Gold</p>
<p>may not be finite, but it&rsquo;s scarce. Those assets continue to</p>
<p>appreciate against the devaluing currency. And so when</p>
<p>you then say, No, I have complete finite supply, with</p>
<p>provability, and this transparency around it, where</p>
<p>everyone knows how much is there and what where it&rsquo;s going. And</p>
<p>now all of a sudden, you and I can transact back and forth that</p>
<p>value. And it is a representation of time. Because</p>
<p>what I can essentially do is if I gather or acquire more of</p>
<p>that wealth, I then can apply leverage to my life. I can use</p>
<p>machines, humans, or some other resources. And basically now</p>
<p>free up my time.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s not fun about the way you are trading time.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a little bit indirect, but maybe not. So just</p>
<p>because I brought up Eric and you&rsquo;re on Twitter, I&rsquo;d love to</p>
<p>hear your opinions. I talk to him a lot. He seems to have</p>
<p>stepped into the beautiful dance of human communication and the</p>
<p>social dynamics that is the Bitcoin cryptocurrency</p>
<p>community. Do you have thoughts on gauge, theoretic concepts,</p>
<p>conceptualization of the world, or just Eric in general? He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got a lot of love in his heart, and he&rsquo;s got a grace in the way</p>
<p>he communicates. But he&rsquo;s also loves to play with ideas and</p>
<p>seems to have touched a sensitive point with the Bitcoin</p>
<p>community. Is there anything you could say that&rsquo;s hopeful,</p>
<p>inspiring about that whole dynamic that went down?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know all the details. But what I will say is I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>listened to a number of his podcasts, and him and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>whole bunch of people like him. I basically put them in the</p>
<p>bucket of they&rsquo;re an independent thinker who are courageous</p>
<p>enough to speak their truth, whatever that may be. They are</p>
<p>humble enough to revisit their ideas and say, I got this right,</p>
<p>I got this wrong information change, I&rsquo;ll change my mind.</p>
<p>Obviously, a sign of intelligence to be able to do</p>
<p>that type of stuff. And I actually think that one of the</p>
<p>most scarce things in our society are those independent</p>
<p>thinkers who are able to do all this. Right? Speaking of</p>
<p>scarcity. Yeah. And so to me, I put Eric and the whole host of</p>
<p>other people kind of, if you look at like the intellectual</p>
<p>dark web is kind of a label that&rsquo;s been used. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually some of the most important people in our society,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re the people who are willing to stand up against</p>
<p>the mass kind of thought process. They&rsquo;re willing to talk</p>
<p>about things that others may think are taboo, right? They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>willing to change their mind, which all of a sudden has become</p>
<p>a bad thing rather than a good thing. And so when I see the</p>
<p>exploration of ideas in public, I actually think that those are</p>
<p>the people who are most open to the kind of VM it blowback as</p>
<p>well. Right? Because that&rsquo;s part of what they&rsquo;re doing is that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re eliciting, hey, I&rsquo;m going to throw an idea into the</p>
<p>arena. If it doesn&rsquo;t get attacked, they actually may be</p>
<p>more nervous than if there is some level of, you know, kind of</p>
<p>war of attrition, if you will. And so what I&rsquo;ve seen with a</p>
<p>number of the people who have done this, everyone from some of</p>
<p>the best, you know, hedge fund managers and kind of money</p>
<p>managers in the world, all the way to what I&rsquo;ll consider some</p>
<p>of the most intellectual people in the world is they play with</p>
<p>these ideas. And they play with the ideas and they play with</p>
<p>them and they put them and they all arrive at the same</p>
<p>conclusion. And sometimes it takes a month, sometimes it</p>
<p>takes years, but they arrive at this Bitcoin thesis. And what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so interesting about it is it highlights something that many</p>
<p>people view as a bug. But I think people in the Bitcoin</p>
<p>community view as a feature, which is that community. And so</p>
<p>what ends up happening is when you have something that is as</p>
<p>ambitious as creating a global reserve currency doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>needs to unseat any of the existing ones, but become the</p>
<p>global reserve currency of the internet, right, this digital</p>
<p>economy, you need shepherds of it. And so just like a</p>
<p>technology company wants to find those loyal fans that are</p>
<p>willing to go out and market and word of mouth and, and kind of</p>
<p>not only promote it, but also protect it. This technology</p>
<p>that is this decentralized thing, which uses a financial</p>
<p>incentive in order to elicit the buy in, not from a financial</p>
<p>perspective, but from a mental energy standpoint, has built one</p>
<p>of the most rabid, powerful and engaged communities on the</p>
<p>internet. And what ends up happening is those people have</p>
<p>thought more about these ideas, and actually challenged those</p>
<p>ideas more than anyone else in the world. And so I&rsquo;ve got a lot</p>
<p>of folks who will just say, there&rsquo;s this guy Marty Bent, who</p>
<p>will talk all the time about the Bitcoin critics haven&rsquo;t done</p>
<p>their homework in a lot of cases. So they show up and</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s super intellectual, lazy arguments,</p>
<p>sometimes actually very well thought out arguments, you know,</p>
<p>on the counter to the Bitcoin thesis. But ultimately, what</p>
<p>ends up happening is you&rsquo;re talking to somebody who&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>expert, they&rsquo;ve been thinking about for five, seven, eight, 10</p>
<p>years, right? They&rsquo;ve gone through every simulation you</p>
<p>possibly can. And they show up with data, examples, and</p>
<p>responses. Now, they&rsquo;re not always right. But they&rsquo;ve just</p>
<p>done the work. And so what I actually like about folks like</p>
<p>Eric and others is as they&rsquo;re kind of going through this</p>
<p>journey, they&rsquo;re incredibly smart, right? And they provide,</p>
<p>or they apply a lot of intellectual rigor to some of</p>
<p>these arguments. And so what it does is what does it do? It&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>marketplace. It keeps people honest. Let me sort of make a</p>
<p>few comments. It&rsquo;s kind of interesting. So you&rsquo;re exactly</p>
<p>right. Maybe the blowback is part of the mechanism that</p>
<p>actually develops these ideas and so on. I do want to kind of</p>
<p>speak to a little bit of the toxicity that I&rsquo;ve experienced</p>
<p>in the Bitcoin community. I kind of see it, the Bitcoin</p>
<p>community, I think you paint a really nice picture, which I</p>
<p>kind of see it as an immune system that protects against</p>
<p>sort of the viruses that are bad ideas. That said, the immune</p>
<p>system can destroy a body, right? And the thing you</p>
<p>mentioned about Eric and maybe about myself, and in general,</p>
<p>just people exploring ideas, is there is a Dunning Kruger</p>
<p>effect, which is when you first start exploring ideas deeply,</p>
<p>you have an overblown level of confidence about like how much</p>
<p>you understand. And that&rsquo;s actually the process about</p>
<p>learning, then you realize you don&rsquo;t understand much. What</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed with the Bitcoin community is they&rsquo;re not as</p>
<p>patient with the basics of the Dunning Kruger effect. Like if</p>
<p>I step in and make declarative statements about Bitcoin, like</p>
<p>I, you know, I read a long time ago, the white paper, like at</p>
<p>the cursory level, I felt that I understand the technology,</p>
<p>this is basic intuitions. You know, I didn&rsquo;t think about the</p>
<p>social dynamics. I didn&rsquo;t think about any like financial</p>
<p>implications and a lot of the deep, actually the ongoing</p>
<p>innovations and all that kind of stuff. But I thought I</p>
<p>understood that technology. And so I step in and make</p>
<p>declarative statements. I think those are the first time you</p>
<p>say, okay, what&rsquo;s the role of Bitcoin in the world? You start</p>
<p>thinking about it deeply. And then you make statements. The</p>
<p>toxicity that you get in those first few statements is really</p>
<p>off putting to me. I&rsquo;m somebody that tries to communicate love</p>
<p>and live that with everything I do. And there is a level of</p>
<p>disrespect that I&rsquo;ve experienced, not directly just</p>
<p>observing others, people have been mostly kind to me. And I</p>
<p>appreciate that. But if you&rsquo;re going to criticize me about my</p>
<p>exploration of ideas in Bitcoin, you have to also</p>
<p>acknowledge that I&rsquo;m a human being that got like a PhD in</p>
<p>stuff. Like I did some hard shit that it could be in farming or</p>
<p>it could be in whatever. Like I&rsquo;ve lived life and I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>really thought deeply and I really care. Like I know a lot</p>
<p>of shit. And it&rsquo;s possible that I actually have a lot of ideas</p>
<p>that you can learn from. Now, if it&rsquo;s agriculture, fine. Or if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s artificial intelligence, fine. Like I know what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking about, about certain things. And I could be wrong</p>
<p>about a lot of things. And there&rsquo;s like an exchange of</p>
<p>ideas that makes that mechanism that you talked about more</p>
<p>efficient. Sometimes when the blowback is too strong too</p>
<p>early on, the development of ideas is just inefficient. And</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if there&rsquo;s a, you know, the way it was explained</p>
<p>to me is that for so long, that community was like bombarded</p>
<p>with just like bad ideas, like criticisms. They&rsquo;re just overly</p>
<p>sensitive now to bullshit. They&rsquo;re like triggered by</p>
<p>statements. They&rsquo;ve heard it all before and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh, there they go again with the same old arguments. But</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you have to sort of, I guess, develop</p>
<p>patience and so on. Especially when you feel like in my case</p>
<p>that the person is coming from a good place, right? I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if there&rsquo;s something you could say that&rsquo;s positive about</p>
<p>the future of this kind of overcoming this toxicity.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a couple of trends that are all kind of</p>
<p>coalescing here in these types of experiences. So one is when</p>
<p>you look at a community, there&rsquo;s always a spectrum in</p>
<p>terms of there&rsquo;s some people who over index on kindness and</p>
<p>stupidity. And there&rsquo;s some people who over index on</p>
<p>intelligence and basically just being an asshole. And then you</p>
<p>get everyone in between. And so naturally, as we know, the</p>
<p>extremist ends of any community end up being the loudest</p>
<p>usually. The second thing is there is from the outsider</p>
<p>view, like at the beginning of the exploration of ideas, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very much a learning process. I don&rsquo;t know if I understand</p>
<p>this or not, but here&rsquo;s ideas A, B, and C. From the internal</p>
<p>perspective, there&rsquo;s a trillion dollars of value at stake and</p>
<p>we must protect it with our lives. The truth is probably</p>
<p>somewhere in between there. And again, the world&rsquo;s not black</p>
<p>and white. There&rsquo;s this kind of more gray area that I think</p>
<p>actually is where most people exist. The other thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>at play here is I think the Bitcoin community understands</p>
<p>the internet and internet culture and narratives better</p>
<p>than almost anyone. And so you see this with kind of the just</p>
<p>complete destruction of narratives with memes and just</p>
<p>the visceral reaction and the use of things like Reddit and</p>
<p>Twitter and YouTube, podcasts, just areas where I think a lot</p>
<p>about if you are an upstart and you are going to go challenge</p>
<p>the most well respected elite kind of establishment</p>
<p>institutions in the world, if you walk in in a suit and tie</p>
<p>and you say, I&rsquo;m here to debate you with ideas, you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>get your clock cleaned because they&rsquo;re going to trot out their</p>
<p>lawyers, their regulators, their lobbyists, right? Like all this</p>
<p>stuff. If you instead say, I&rsquo;m going to meme you to death on</p>
<p>the internet and I&rsquo;m going to control the public narrative.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve shifted the power. The asymmetry of power is more</p>
<p>symmetrical now. It&rsquo;s the ultimate insurgency, right? If</p>
<p>you bring it back to the the conflict. Yes. And so when you</p>
<p>think about this, you have to lean into the advantage that</p>
<p>you have. And so what ends up happening is you and I would</p>
<p>absolutely lose it if we saw JP Morgan or Goldman Sachs or the</p>
<p>Federal Reserve start tweeting memes. Yeah, right. It it would</p>
<p>almost the the validation that would give to the medium and</p>
<p>the even playing field that it would provide would pull these</p>
<p>establishments down to the level of what is this upstart?</p>
<p>But now what you&rsquo;re starting to see is that the Bitcoin</p>
<p>community, even though there&rsquo;s some level of toxicity at</p>
<p>times, even though there&rsquo;s this visceral reaction, sometimes</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s even what I would call bullying or or or kind of</p>
<p>outward projection of things, right? Even though it may be a</p>
<p>small percentage, it&rsquo;ll happen every once in a while. What</p>
<p>they do understand, though, is that these establishments are</p>
<p>made up of humans. And what you can actually do, one of the</p>
<p>best ways to pick apart an institution is to recruit from</p>
<p>inside of them one by one. Yes. And so what you&rsquo;re starting</p>
<p>to see now is I mean, I get the messages on Twitter and</p>
<p>LinkedIn all the time. Hey, I&rsquo;m a banker by trade, but I&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>bitcoiner at heart, right? And so what you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>essentially infiltrating the organizations, not in in</p>
<p>physical, you know, population. Yeah. But with the ideas and</p>
<p>with the philosophies, banker in the streets, bitcoiner in the</p>
<p>sheets. Yeah. Okay. I like it. With that said, in terms of</p>
<p>shitposting and memes, I gotta say like bring it on because I</p>
<p>believe in terms of asymmetry of power, I believe in that</p>
<p>love will save the world, not memes. Or at least good vibe</p>
<p>memes as opposed to shitposting. It&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>battleground, though. It&rsquo;s an interesting battleground to</p>
<p>think about. The other thing I would say, too, is one of the</p>
<p>elements that&rsquo;s always kind of funny to me is how much of the</p>
<p>entertainment is love, right? So, when you start to think</p>
<p>about how many of the memes that are posted, for example,</p>
<p>are for outsiders versus insiders. Yes. Laser eyes,</p>
<p>right? Which seems absolutely ridiculous, elementary, and</p>
<p>frankly, beneath anyone in any level of power or influence in</p>
<p>the world somehow has congressmen and senators who</p>
<p>have done it. Yeah. They&rsquo;re not trying to convince their</p>
<p>colleagues in elected positions to become bitcoiners. Yeah.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re speaking directly internally to the Bitcoin</p>
<p>community. Yeah, there&rsquo;s some sense in which, yes, memes is</p>
<p>love. Even I keep hearing Bitcoin is love. They&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to convert me. The one that you have to laugh at, right?</p>
<p>Probably my favorite one out of all of it is I&rsquo;ve seen on</p>
<p>multiple occasions, you know, Mark Cuban a couple of years</p>
<p>ago, Kevin O Leary, whoever, you know, wealthy people,</p>
<p>billionaires, etcetera, and you have people on anonymous</p>
<p>accounts who who knows who they are telling them have fun</p>
<p>staying poor, right? It&rsquo;s just, you know, it&rsquo;s just, again,</p>
<p>part of a community and I think it&rsquo;s a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s bad aspects to it at times but I do think it&rsquo;s a net</p>
<p>positive. Yeah, just like the immune system. It does a lot of</p>
<p>crappy stuff but overall, it&rsquo;s a major net positive. Maybe</p>
<p>this is a bit of a personal question for me. It just added</p>
<p>my own curiosity but I&rsquo;ve talked to Ray Dalio a few</p>
<p>times. So, Ray Dalio, I think was one of those people that</p>
<p>took that journey, the Bitcoin journey. Do you have thoughts</p>
<p>about him specifically about that whole world and about the</p>
<p>journey maybe of others that are going through the same</p>
<p>process because Ray is, at least from my perspective, I&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>bit of an outsider. He&rsquo;s one of the most insightful and deep</p>
<p>thinkers about investment, about finance, about economics</p>
<p>in general. Actually, about life. So, it&rsquo;s interesting to</p>
<p>see him go on that journey. Do you have something to comment</p>
<p>about Ray or just those kinds of people in general? So, if we</p>
<p>look at what I&rsquo;ll just consider the legends of Wall Street in</p>
<p>general. Yeah. Right? There&rsquo;s no denying that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>incredibly intelligent. There&rsquo;s no denying that actually,</p>
<p>especially in the hedge fund world, they&rsquo;re some of the most</p>
<p>open minded people in terms of they&rsquo;re willing to change their</p>
<p>mind when they get new information. There&rsquo;s no doubt</p>
<p>that they are historians in the sense of having studied</p>
<p>financial markets and cycles over time. And also, one of the</p>
<p>things that I really respect about all those guys is almost</p>
<p>all of them are willing to put ideas out via various writings</p>
<p>that they do and accept the public criticism, right?</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s Howard Marks, Ray or others, they will put this</p>
<p>stuff out in public. And sure, there&rsquo;s a lot of people who are</p>
<p>supportive and kind of are part of a fan base, if you will. But</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people who also think that sometimes they</p>
<p>say stupid things. And so, putting that out takes kind of</p>
<p>courage, right? I think Ray&rsquo;s actually the most fascinating</p>
<p>though out of all of these kind of legends of Wall Street in</p>
<p>that he understands debt cycles. He understands</p>
<p>currencies. He, for a while now, has been all over and</p>
<p>famously said, you know, cash is trash, investible assets,</p>
<p>right? He kind of like just knew all of it. And for a long</p>
<p>time, Bitcoiners have said, Ray, you understand the Bitcoin</p>
<p>argument, you&rsquo;re just missing the last part, which is Bitcoin</p>
<p>is the solution, right? And so, he was gold and some other</p>
<p>ideas. But I think that he&rsquo;s a perfect example of when you are</p>
<p>part of the establishment, people view you in a very</p>
<p>static way as the leader of a part of establishment. But</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s Bill Gates, Ray Dalio, or somebody else, each</p>
<p>one of these people were innovators and challengers to a</p>
<p>system. They were upstarts at one point. And so, it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>this idea that like if you live long enough, you eventually</p>
<p>become the man, right? And so, you know, Gates is a good</p>
<p>example, right? Warren Buffett is a good example. Ray Dalio is</p>
<p>a good example, etc. And so, you have to give credit, I think,</p>
<p>to Dalio in the sense of he kept an open mind about all of</p>
<p>this and more so than many of his peers has continued to do</p>
<p>the work and come around to this idea. And now, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to know if I wanted to say that he&rsquo;s a Bitcoin</p>
<p>proponent as much as he believes it is one of a portion</p>
<p>of assets that can be a solution. And so, to me, when</p>
<p>you start to convince those types of people, when it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Paul Tudor Jones, a Stanley Druckenmiller, Ray Dalio,</p>
<p>Howard Marks now even writing about it saying, hey, I was</p>
<p>anti Bitcoin and put a ton of intellectual rigor into it.</p>
<p>But thank God my son bought a bunch for our family, right?</p>
<p>And kind of we&rsquo;ve had exposure to it. I think what it does is</p>
<p>more than anything, it&rsquo;s not going to convince somebody to</p>
<p>go and take it seriously or go ahead and make an allocation.</p>
<p>It reduces career risk. And so, if all of a sudden when Paul</p>
<p>Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller come out and</p>
<p>say, hey, I own Bitcoin and here&rsquo;s why, every other</p>
<p>investor on Wall Street now can say to an investment</p>
<p>committee, well, it&rsquo;s good enough for Paul Tudor Jones,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good enough for Stanley Druckenmiller. And so, I think</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s very interesting because Ray doesn&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>represent Wall Street. I think Ray in some weird way</p>
<p>represents this like macro economic investor. And so,</p>
<p>some of those are in hedge funds and some of those people</p>
<p>would be like CIOs at organizations. Some of them</p>
<p>would be at corporations and some of them are just kind of</p>
<p>retail investors. And so, you can see this kind of inflection</p>
<p>point throughout the adoption of Bitcoin, right? There was</p>
<p>infrastructure that got built. Okay, that kind of led to more</p>
<p>adoption. There was certain individuals, right? Usually</p>
<p>they were kind of technology oriented, entrepreneurial</p>
<p>billionaires. They would buy it and come out and say it. Okay,</p>
<p>that led to inflection points. You started to have some of</p>
<p>these kind of Wall Street legends come out, sort of</p>
<p>financial institutions started. And now, you&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>corporations start to do it, right? Eventually, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be a central bank that does it. And so, you kind of</p>
<p>walk through that line and what you understand is like, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the same thing every time. It&rsquo;s just somebody new, right? That</p>
<p>path, right? That Bitcoiners journey, if you will. And I</p>
<p>think that that is almost the beauty of it is if you</p>
<p>short circuit the journey, it&rsquo;s almost like somebody doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>appreciate it, right? If you take, let&rsquo;s say, somebody who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a young kid and you just give them a bunch of money and they</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have to work hard for it. They don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>appreciate it. Well, and Ray actually has a book</p>
<p>principles, right? And he talks about the hero&rsquo;s journey. So,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like living it in some sense in terms of, you know,</p>
<p>thinking about digital currency in general, like digital</p>
<p>finance. It&rsquo;s one of the big transitions, transformations of</p>
<p>our world in some sense. It&rsquo;s not just about money. Or you</p>
<p>could argue that money is everything. I mean, it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>money isn&rsquo;t just the narrow definition of money. Money is</p>
<p>really everything. And so, where you could argue that sort</p>
<p>of cryptocurrency is like the base layer of this</p>
<p>transformation to the digital space and everything else would</p>
<p>just be built on top of it. I use a different word that I</p>
<p>think is kind of closer to your world, which is it&rsquo;s ultimately</p>
<p>automation. And what I mean by that is, you know, before 1970</p>
<p>or 1980, all the assets were analog. And so, when you have</p>
<p>analog assets, physical stock certificates, physical bonds,</p>
<p>right, physical deed to a home, you have to physically exchange</p>
<p>them. When we wanted to increase transactions and</p>
<p>increase kind of global finance and access, we took those</p>
<p>physical assets and we created electronic QCIP assets. So, now</p>
<p>we have in centralized databases kind of a file, represents the</p>
<p>asset that&rsquo;s sitting somewhere in custody. And you and I can</p>
<p>transact them a little bit easier, but still centralized.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still some bureaucracy and, you know, maybe it takes</p>
<p>two days to transact rather than actually mailing it across</p>
<p>the world. Now, what we&rsquo;re seeing is a transition from</p>
<p>those electronic QCIPs to these digital assets. And so, if you</p>
<p>look at, again, just let&rsquo;s say money or currency, every</p>
<p>currency in the world is going to be digital. You&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have a digital dollar, a digital euro, yen, RMB. You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have decentralized kind of open source money like</p>
<p>Bitcoin. You&rsquo;re also going to have private currencies like</p>
<p>Facebook&rsquo;s attempt at DiEM and there will be others that will</p>
<p>try to do this. And so, when you get everything digital, right,</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s the kind of the first step that everyone</p>
<p>focuses on, the competition at the technology layer</p>
<p>essentially goes away. You get some level of feature parity</p>
<p>and sure, there&rsquo;s bells and whistles on each kind of</p>
<p>implementation of a digital currency, but at the end of the</p>
<p>day, the technology is relatively the same. And</p>
<p>ultimately, what it will do is it will facilitate the adoption</p>
<p>of digital wallets. So, you have to have a digital wallet</p>
<p>regardless of what digital currency you have. Same with me,</p>
<p>same with everybody else in the world. But what it does do is</p>
<p>when you kind of push away and reduce the friction of</p>
<p>competition at the technology layer, it moves the competition</p>
<p>to the monetary policy layer. And so, when you get to that</p>
<p>layer, now it becomes interesting because all of the</p>
<p>currencies are the same except for this one right now and maybe</p>
<p>there will be others in the future. But for sure, Bitcoin</p>
<p>today and people may try to replicate in a private manner</p>
<p>or something, but Bitcoin is kind of the only finite scarce</p>
<p>digital somebody. And so, when you then have that pretty big</p>
<p>difference in that competition at the monetary policy layer,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually not going to matter where you get paid.</p>
<p>Right? And what I mean by that is like you and I both live in</p>
<p>a single currency environment. I get paid in dollars. I</p>
<p>historically have saved in dollars. All of the assets in</p>
<p>my life are denominated in dollars and I owe my debts in</p>
<p>dollars, whether it&rsquo;s taxes or in the private market. And I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to worry about foreign currencies. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exchange anything. The only time I would ever think about</p>
<p>another currency is if I&rsquo;m going to another country in</p>
<p>their single currency environment. And in order to</p>
<p>change or exchange my currency, I go to the bank or I go get</p>
<p>ripped off at the airport. Right? Those are my two options.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s high friction to change between currencies. When</p>
<p>the competition of technology is kind of innovated away, now</p>
<p>I can get paid in dollars, these digital dollars, and with</p>
<p>a click of a button, switch into any other currency in the</p>
<p>world. And so, what ultimately happens is value and liquidity</p>
<p>is going to coalesce around the best monetary policy. And so,</p>
<p>you get in this very weird world where even if the United</p>
<p>States says, hey, you&rsquo;re going to get paid in dollars, you have</p>
<p>to pay your taxes in dollars. You&rsquo;re going to start to see</p>
<p>people operate in a multi currency environment where they</p>
<p>say, okay, I got paid in my digital dollar, click a button,</p>
<p>I save in Bitcoin. It stays there or grows my purchasing</p>
<p>power. Oh, I need to pay my taxes. Let me switch back into</p>
<p>dollars with click of a button and pay. When you go to a</p>
<p>multi currency world, it&rsquo;s not just about currency. It&rsquo;s now</p>
<p>multi asset world. Because not only is the currency</p>
<p>digitized, but that same technology is used to digitize</p>
<p>stocks, bonds, and commodities as well. And so, today we live</p>
<p>in a very fragmented financial world where basically I have a</p>
<p>brokerage account, I have a bank account, I may have an</p>
<p>alternative asset account, etc. When I can put all those assets</p>
<p>in a single digital wallet, and I can then go from asset to</p>
<p>asset without having to go back to a single unit of account.</p>
<p>Like frictionless going from asset to asset. Yeah. So now</p>
<p>what you end up doing is you start to open up the</p>
<p>possibility for machine to machine transactions. Yeah. So</p>
<p>today, if you and I write software code for two machines</p>
<p>to transact with each other, they can&rsquo;t transact physical</p>
<p>currency. And in many cases, they can&rsquo;t actually transact</p>
<p>the electronic QCIP currencies or assets either because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s too long of a settlement time. So you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get true automation, right? So the whole idea of the car&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to drive over a strip in the road and it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>pay the toll, right? Well, that can&rsquo;t happen right now</p>
<p>because literally the transaction won&rsquo;t go through,</p>
<p>right? And so I always joke that in an automated world,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a CD ROM, but we&rsquo;re trying to take cassette tape</p>
<p>player assets and put it in the CD ROM. It&rsquo;s just incompatible</p>
<p>technology. Reference is nobody understands at this point.</p>
<p>By the way, you need to update your reference. I probably</p>
<p>do. It&rsquo;s like taking a CD ROM and trying to put an MP3</p>
<p>player into a streaming. But I think that the reason why</p>
<p>that becomes really interesting is when you start to create</p>
<p>these digital assets, now you open up the world of</p>
<p>possibilities. So when new technology is created, you can</p>
<p>do two things. You can either create new things the world&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never seen before, or you can use it to improve the old</p>
<p>world. Most people, because it&rsquo;s the easiest thing to</p>
<p>think about, want to improve the old world. So an equivalent</p>
<p>of this would be when the internet came along, a media</p>
<p>company that had newspapers would say, hey, we should take</p>
<p>a PDF of the newspaper and we should put it on a website. And</p>
<p>now anyone in the world can go to this website and they can</p>
<p>read the newspaper today. That was valuable, but it missed out</p>
<p>on the ability to change headlines, to test, to put</p>
<p>multimedia, to distribute it differently, to do all kinds of</p>
<p>things that today we understand the internet really empowered.</p>
<p>And so what I think we&rsquo;re about to watch happen is we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to digitize the assets. We&rsquo;re going to put them all into</p>
<p>these digital wallets. You&rsquo;re going to get automated</p>
<p>technologies where machines can now transact with each other.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to do simple things like why do we pay</p>
<p>people once every two weeks? Why don&rsquo;t we just pay them at</p>
<p>the end of every day? Or why don&rsquo;t I literally stream</p>
<p>payments to you on an hour by hour basis based on the work</p>
<p>you do? It would solve incredible economic issues in</p>
<p>our country and in countries around the world. But</p>
<p>historically businesses can&rsquo;t do this because of the</p>
<p>technology problem. They can&rsquo;t keep track of it all. How do</p>
<p>they pay everyone every day? How do they pay everyone every</p>
<p>hour? You just can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s funny. The vision of the future you&rsquo;re painting,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of an exciting one. And it almost makes me sad</p>
<p>looking into the future when we&rsquo;ll look back at this time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like how incredibly inefficient financial</p>
<p>transactions were. Like the transaction of value of any</p>
<p>kind. Like how to pay each other. Like there has to be</p>
<p>processes. There&rsquo;s like payroll and all this kind of just the</p>
<p>entirety of the transactions is just like painful. Almost</p>
<p>all transactions are painful. And the companies that</p>
<p>innovate to make the transactions a little bit more</p>
<p>frictionless like Amazon with the one click purchase button</p>
<p>like went out huge. But even that&rsquo;s really painful. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually really interesting especially when you start to</p>
<p>move that into the space of data. There&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>thinking about privacy and data and like can we put, can</p>
<p>we like convert data into like money so that you can pay for</p>
<p>how much you reveal to the companies about your own</p>
<p>private data that can then be used to assign value to you so</p>
<p>you can use the service for free if you hand over the data</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s like explicit transaction going on. So you</p>
<p>can empower all those kinds of things that will just like</p>
<p>fundamentally change our world. That&rsquo;s really, really,</p>
<p>really exciting.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting things to me is I invested in</p>
<p>a company called Bridget and what they told me was they said</p>
<p>$8 billion was paid to the top four banks last year on</p>
<p>overdraft fees. So literally they took $8 billion from</p>
<p>people who didn&rsquo;t have money in their bank account, right?</p>
<p>And so when you dig into why is that a lot of times it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>that the people don&rsquo;t have the money. It&rsquo;s actually a</p>
<p>mismatch of the payments. So what ends up happening is you</p>
<p>get paid on the 1st and the 15th but on the 12th your</p>
<p>Netflix bill hits, on the 13th you went grocery shopping, and</p>
<p>on the 14th your car payments hit, you overdraft, and then</p>
<p>on the 15th you actually get the check and then you&rsquo;re able</p>
<p>to pay not only the overdraft but for the expenses that you</p>
<p>have. And so something as simple as just getting paid at</p>
<p>the end of every day immediately would eliminate</p>
<p>some big percentage of those $8 billion of value that flows</p>
<p>to large institutions on overdraft fees.</p>
<p>Yeah and also I mean this whole process with overdraft fees</p>
<p>and just many of the financial transactions we have to live</p>
<p>through today forces many of us to be like accountants, like</p>
<p>to understand the different mechanism of financial like</p>
<p>the movement of money as opposed to you which is what we</p>
<p>want to do as human beings operating in high layers of</p>
<p>like providing services for others, of like following your</p>
<p>passions and like working for others, like doing cool shit</p>
<p>or you know basically providing value, exchanging value</p>
<p>in the world and not thinking about the money. The money</p>
<p>takes care of itself and then you see the results of it.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re able to think in terms of money but not have to</p>
<p>know how like the accounting works.</p>
<p>Automation simply frees humans up to do more creative</p>
<p>work.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And what we</p>
<p>Which is why you use the term automation which I think is</p>
<p>kind of brilliant reframing of all of this.</p>
<p>Yeah because ultimately digital technologies are merely</p>
<p>the conduit to ushers into that world and I think the most</p>
<p>fascinating part of this entire industry is people who are</p>
<p>trying to figure out now that we&rsquo;re going to have these</p>
<p>digital technologies how do we usher in that automated world</p>
<p>faster and so there&rsquo;s people who are building all kinds of</p>
<p>incredible things right there&rsquo;s literally some technologies</p>
<p>where you can stream for paying for consumption of content.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right there&rsquo;s I saw somebody recently who they basically</p>
<p>said hey I have created something but it&rsquo;s not going to</p>
<p>be released until everyone and almost like a GoFundMe type</p>
<p>situation pays for it in combination then it gets</p>
<p>unlocked and so when you start to think about this it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>only innovation on the technology front it&rsquo;s innovation</p>
<p>around the way that we form capital it&rsquo;s the way that we</p>
<p>organize resources it&rsquo;s the way that we build companies it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the business models right it&rsquo;s the application of those</p>
<p>technologies all that stuff starts to change and go back to</p>
<p>a 2007 that&rsquo;s when the iPhone came out Uber wasn&rsquo;t possible</p>
<p>right I&rsquo;m just going to lie like all these companies that</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t possible before when the digital technologies are</p>
<p>kind of adopted on a global scale I think that we all myself</p>
<p>included drastically underestimate how fast and how</p>
<p>big innovation can be because it&rsquo;s just hard right like like</p>
<p>we like to think linearly and that&rsquo;s not how the world works.</p>
<p>Yeah I do find it kind of interesting it is NFT based but</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it has to be this this idea of I think big clout</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called or whatever the idea of sort of investing in</p>
<p>individuals it makes me immediately think about</p>
<p>investing in ideas so even just the words you speak having</p>
<p>value and sort of if you have a frictionless like automated</p>
<p>financial system then you could do a bunch of interesting</p>
<p>things about what it means to add value to the world I mean</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if big cloud is currently an efficient</p>
<p>representation of that but I am truly happy that however that</p>
<p>thing works I&rsquo;m just one notch above Vladimir Putin which is</p>
<p>one of the that&rsquo;s like one of the bucket list items for me to</p>
<p>to have a list where I&rsquo;m one notch above Putin well what I</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re talking about here is important because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>historical examples you could invest in a patent in some</p>
<p>situations you could invest in an organization that has an</p>
<p>idea right so these are super inefficient given kind of the</p>
<p>vision that you&rsquo;re painting in terms of like investing directly</p>
<p>in an idea in a super efficient automated fashion yeah but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how the technology evolution works right is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really hard to do at first and then slowly kind of becomes</p>
<p>easier and easier as technology is more prevalent the other</p>
<p>thing that I think is interesting is this whole idea</p>
<p>of investing in people if you really think about the</p>
<p>origination of that is I would hire somebody right I pay you</p>
<p>money and then you&rsquo;re going to create production but I take</p>
<p>the lion&rsquo;s share and you don&rsquo;t now there&rsquo;s things like these</p>
<p>ISAs these income sharing agreements where basically I</p>
<p>will educate you on something train you on something I&rsquo;ll put</p>
<p>up capital right and then over time you&rsquo;ll pay me back plus</p>
<p>profits as some version eventually I don&rsquo;t know what it</p>
<p>looks like but being able to get upside in somebody&rsquo;s success</p>
<p>for having risk capital early on doesn&rsquo;t seem that far off</p>
<p>see it in professional sports you see it in you know a lot of</p>
<p>these things and so I just think that a lot of the focus</p>
<p>right now is on the technology but ultimately these are ideas</p>
<p>that are very old and have had lots of success and traction</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just merely standing in the way of the evolution of</p>
<p>these ideas with new technology and so it&rsquo;s easy to get caught</p>
<p>up in the technology but when you really zoom out and look at</p>
<p>it from the ideological standpoint and kind of the</p>
<p>progress of humanity it&rsquo;s a foregone conclusion this stuff&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to happen it&rsquo;s just how I think the world is waiting and</p>
<p>some of us are trying to create that future world which is like</p>
<p>what are the applications of this technology that will</p>
<p>transform the world and then you know I hate the term but</p>
<p>killer apps like cool ideas that are implemented effectively at</p>
<p>scale that transform the world and there&rsquo;s been a there&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>a lot of different ideas popping up like the there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of ideas about social networks that are built on top</p>
<p>of the technology and all that kind of stuff so but let me</p>
<p>actually drag this back down to something basic if a person</p>
<p>wanted to buy Bitcoin store Bitcoin how do they actually do</p>
<p>it yeah so there&rsquo;s a couple of different ways to kind of</p>
<p>acquire Bitcoin and in every way you&rsquo;ve got to exchange</p>
<p>some form of value for Bitcoin right which is part of why it</p>
<p>has values because you&rsquo;re giving up value so in one way is</p>
<p>to exchange energy and computational power for Bitcoin</p>
<p>so you can mine it you can literally take computer power</p>
<p>that you have you can rent it to the network and run that</p>
<p>software and then it will pay you a portion of the kind of</p>
<p>daily revenue off that system and you can acquire Bitcoin in</p>
<p>exchange for your power and your computational kind of</p>
<p>contribution and that&rsquo;s the fundamental principle behind</p>
<p>Bitcoin is the proof of work so I got a hundred bucks like I</p>
<p>use cash app the you know they there&rsquo;s Coinbase there&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>these exchanges like how do I convert my $100 to Bitcoin is</p>
<p>there something disclaimer this is not financial advice and</p>
<p>this is just us talking and just your opinions this do not</p>
<p>use this to invest or take as financial expertise that said</p>
<p>like is there something you recommend that&rsquo;s an easy entry</p>
<p>point for somebody that&rsquo;s like hmm I wonder if I can convert</p>
<p>this hundred dollars into whatever amount of Bitcoin what</p>
<p>do you recommend what are the options so there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>options I&rsquo;m heavily biased I went out and I scoured the</p>
<p>market looked at all of them I&rsquo;ve invested a lot of money in</p>
<p>a company called BlockFi that basically basically has</p>
<p>financial products for crypto investors so you can go you can</p>
<p>take dollars or other currency you have you can convert it</p>
<p>through an exchange you can leave it on these interest</p>
<p>bearing accounts you can earn interest just like you would</p>
<p>earn in a traditional account but higher levels of interest</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s this new thing or you can withdraw it and you can</p>
<p>put it into cold storage on a hardware device you can leave</p>
<p>it in a software wallet there&rsquo;s kind of all these storage</p>
<p>options so BlockFi is you know kind of the one that I&rsquo;m biased</p>
<p>towards because I&rsquo;m sorry to interrupt so BlockFi is Bitcoin</p>
<p>only or is it an exchange with other crypto it&rsquo;s got a bunch</p>
<p>of different ones yeah they basically are agnostic to what</p>
<p>it is but they provide kind of financial you know products to</p>
<p>crypto investors okay so you mentioned a few interesting</p>
<p>ideas that&rsquo;d be nice for people who would not be familiar with</p>
<p>it cold storage hot storage what does that mean so like I go to</p>
<p>a website and I convert dollars to Bitcoin that&rsquo;s a kind of</p>
<p>storage that&rsquo;s like online banking right what else is</p>
<p>there so there&rsquo;s a couple of different things that you can</p>
<p>do right and let&rsquo;s use the legacy system as kind of an</p>
<p>example so if I want to get currency and I put in my bank</p>
<p>account it sits there I have to trust that the bank doesn&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>under nobody steals it all this kind of stuff there&rsquo;s insurance</p>
<p>for it right there&rsquo;s all these kind of benefits in the legacy</p>
<p>system to make sure that as long as I don&rsquo;t have you know</p>
<p>millions and millions of dollars there I&rsquo;m going to be</p>
<p>protected pretty much if anything happens through FDIC</p>
<p>insurance if I want to do that I&rsquo;m taking that counterparty</p>
<p>risk though so it&rsquo;s mitigated but there&rsquo;s still counterparty</p>
<p>risk I&rsquo;m counting on that bank but it is easier to move it</p>
<p>around right if all of a sudden you call me up and say hey send</p>
<p>me some money I can press a couple buttons on my computer</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll send it to you if I want deeper level of security I</p>
<p>can go and I can get the physical dollars and I can go</p>
<p>and I can you know put under my mattress right and I can say</p>
<p>you know what it&rsquo;s not gonna be as easy to send it to you</p>
<p>immediately but if I really want to I can go underneath my</p>
<p>mattress pretty quickly I can grab it I can get it back to</p>
<p>the bank and then I can send you the money the third thing I</p>
<p>could do is I could basically take those physical dollars out</p>
<p>of the bank and I could go and I could go put it literally you</p>
<p>know in a vault somewhere that I don&rsquo;t have control over that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>behind 10 passwords and biometric scanning and like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really difficult to even get to it right so if you can almost</p>
<p>look at it it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s three stages of security that</p>
<p>you could have in the traditional world the same thing</p>
<p>is true in Bitcoin so you could buy Bitcoin on any exchange you</p>
<p>can do it on BlockFi but you also can do it on places like</p>
<p>Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken, etc. Also Cash App. Cash App. You can</p>
<p>do it on Cash App. I think I think they&rsquo;re still sponsoring</p>
<p>this podcast. I&rsquo;m not biased at all. So once you get Bitcoin</p>
<p>on any of these venues you can leave it there on that venue.</p>
<p>Now the trade off is you&rsquo;re taking counterparty risk so</p>
<p>somebody else is responsible for the security and the</p>
<p>protection of it in many cases big well known companies who</p>
<p>have billions of billions of dollars of assets they have</p>
<p>higher levels of security that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re well known</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why people trust them whatever but you are taking</p>
<p>counterparty risk it is easier to quickly send to somebody so</p>
<p>that so the trade off of like ease of use but counterparty</p>
<p>risk is big and in the Bitcoin community specifically there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a huge thing of they really really have a keep for not</p>
<p>leaving the Bitcoin there right for the obvious counterparty</p>
<p>the second thing you can do is you can basically get it off of</p>
<p>an exchange and you can put it in some level of kind of what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll call a second layer of storage that second layer</p>
<p>storage could be a hardware device that you can quickly</p>
<p>just you know grab off your desk and plug into your</p>
<p>computer and immediately use that&rsquo;s what they call like a</p>
<p>hardware wallet or you can have some sort of software wallet</p>
<p>right where it&rsquo;s not on an exchange but there is some</p>
<p>level of in between between the hardware wallet and the</p>
<p>exchange and the software wallet but the software wallet</p>
<p>is connected to the internet yeah and so if you kind of</p>
<p>think of it as like the exchange software wallet</p>
<p>hardware wallet and then there&rsquo;s something called deep</p>
<p>storage right or cold storage and this is you know</p>
<p>literally there was a company called Zappo that would put</p>
<p>things in deep cold storage and it was literally buried in</p>
<p>a mountain right so like the odds that somebody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>physically going to go there there&rsquo;s armed guards there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know kind of all this type of stuff but again you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking some level of counterparty risk because they</p>
<p>have your Bitcoin and so the saying or the phrase is not</p>
<p>your keys not your coins whereas my buddy Isaiah Jackson</p>
<p>came up with he said not your keys not your cheese right in</p>
<p>terms of sovereignty is important right and ultimately</p>
<p>this goes back to kind of the beginning of our conversation</p>
<p>around Bitcoin&rsquo;s ethos sovereignty right giving the</p>
<p>power back to people you don&rsquo;t have to rely on this</p>
<p>infrastructure in order to be able to participate in this</p>
<p>monetary kind of economy what you are now able to do is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re able to use digital sound money you&rsquo;re able to</p>
<p>keep control of it you and you alone are responsible for it</p>
<p>so the idea of personal responsibility and then also</p>
<p>you and you alone make the decisions as to whether you</p>
<p>hold on to it or you use it without censorship right no</p>
<p>one can tell you what you can do with it or can&rsquo;t do with it</p>
<p>and so the purchase and the storage what I find is</p>
<p>depending on who you are there&rsquo;s varying degrees of kind</p>
<p>of concern or decisions that get made there and a lot of it</p>
<p>comes down to personal preference the Bitcoin</p>
<p>community though absolutely will over optimize for</p>
<p>sovereignty and kind of hardware or cold storage I</p>
<p>wonder if you can sort of comment on that because you</p>
<p>have both sort of cash app and the BlockFi and Coinbase like</p>
<p>you can store it that you can purchase and trade it there</p>
<p>and store it there and so on but ultimately they&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>you wanna you know keep some of it there but you wanna move</p>
<p>it to the hardware wallet and the cold storage of the</p>
<p>hardware wallet is like you can disconnect this from the</p>
<p>computer because ultimately stuff that&rsquo;s connected to the</p>
<p>internet can be compromised can be controlled by governments</p>
<p>and other parties and so on what are your thoughts about</p>
<p>sort of practically speaking for maybe like a regular</p>
<p>citizen what&rsquo;s what should be the role of the hardware wallet</p>
<p>in their lives yeah so at the highest level I just think</p>
<p>that like learning about it is important right so even if you</p>
<p>only have five dollars equivalent of Bitcoin going and</p>
<p>understanding here&rsquo;s how it works here&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s how I would actually withdraw from an exchange under</p>
<p>the hardware wall like that alone just as an intellectual</p>
<p>exercise is a worthwhile pursuit I think people should</p>
<p>go do that actually go through the process of the steps so</p>
<p>you feel like you can you can do it yeah yeah it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>like if I said to you you know hey we&rsquo;re gonna go buy an</p>
<p>asset and you never went and you looked at it you never went</p>
<p>and you know made a decision like sure maybe I did it or I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t do it but like you didn&rsquo;t actually experience it</p>
<p>right and so I think that that&rsquo;s important part the</p>
<p>second thing is each person is different from a how they view</p>
<p>this asset so there are some people who are speculating</p>
<p>right there&rsquo;s three use cases for Bitcoin their store value</p>
<p>medium of exchange and speculation and the people who</p>
<p>are speculating they can&rsquo;t put it in deep cold storage because</p>
<p>they need to be able to trade it right so what ends up</p>
<p>happening is they fall in the bucket of like high risk high</p>
<p>reward they&rsquo;re trying to trade they&rsquo;re trying to do all these</p>
<p>things and sure maybe there are profits that they can generate</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re good at it but also they&rsquo;re introducing a lot of</p>
<p>risk and so that person is very different than the person who</p>
<p>says hey you know I bought one Bitcoin and I&rsquo;m gonna save it</p>
<p>for my child right and I&rsquo;m gonna give it to them on their</p>
<p>18th birthday yeah and so when you start to look at this what</p>
<p>you end up saying is what are you actually purchasing this</p>
<p>for kind of like why are you doing it and then what&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>time horizon and what ends up happening is more and more</p>
<p>people in the Bitcoin community have longer time horizons one</p>
<p>of the advantages to this community right if you look at</p>
<p>the on chain metrics 60% of Bitcoin haven&rsquo;t moved from the</p>
<p>digital wallet in which they sit in the last 12 months so</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s appreciated hundreds of percent on the</p>
<p>upside there&rsquo;s been lots of volatility a 50% drop in a</p>
<p>single day in terms of US dollar price still doesn&rsquo;t move</p>
<p>and so these are the kind of long term holders right these</p>
<p>are the the iron fist or or as recently has become popular the</p>
<p>diamond hands right they just they&rsquo;re not going anywhere and</p>
<p>so I think that those people are much more likely to not have</p>
<p>their Bitcoin on exchanges or in software walls they&rsquo;ve got it</p>
<p>in some sort of like highly secure environment and what and</p>
<p>one in which they have deep sovereignty or kind of prevalent</p>
<p>sovereignty and the reason for that is because they have that</p>
<p>long time horizon they don&rsquo;t want to be kind of convicted</p>
<p>around Bitcoin sound money macro environment all stuff and</p>
<p>then they make a mistake because they trusted you know</p>
<p>ABCD company and that counterparty risk ends up</p>
<p>actually being you know fatal or or detrimental so again this</p>
<p>is not financial advice disclaimer but let me ask so</p>
<p>in terms of investment advice on Bitcoin so you see Bitcoin</p>
<p>potentially not just the thing that you speculate over like</p>
<p>buy and sell buy and sell buy and sell but it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that you can just buy only and I believe I&rsquo;ve heard that you</p>
<p>own quite a large percentage of of your wealth in in Bitcoin</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re basically buying only and storing long term so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s a legitimate way to approach</p>
<p>Bitcoin in your recommendation go to other cultures so if we</p>
<p>remove ourselves from the Western world culture of</p>
<p>investing in gamification of financial markets and the</p>
<p>financialization of everything let&rsquo;s say we go to the culture</p>
<p>of India for hundreds if not thousands of years families</p>
<p>basically saved their wealth in gold and in jewelry and in</p>
<p>these hard assets with the expectation to pass it on to</p>
<p>the next generation and so it would be blasphemous to sell</p>
<p>the family&rsquo;s gold in that culture right you know your</p>
<p>great grandfather gave to your grandfather your grandfather</p>
<p>gave to your father your father gave it to you right and</p>
<p>so in that culture the long term kind of holding is the</p>
<p>default I think that what Bitcoin has presented again is</p>
<p>a digital application of the exact same thing which is that</p>
<p>while everything else in the world is being devalued that is</p>
<p>denominated in a currency that is being inflated away whether</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s quickly or not this finite supply this scarce asset ends</p>
<p>up accruing more and more value over time right and so I think</p>
<p>that for me personally I&rsquo;ve got you know over 95% of my net</p>
<p>worth that&rsquo;s in this 90 over 95% of your net worth there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>two important caveats to this one is I didn&rsquo;t you know buy</p>
<p>some Bitcoin in 2011 or 12 right and then all of a sudden it</p>
<p>appreciated a bunch and it grew into that but from a cost</p>
<p>basis perspective you know put $100 and now it&rsquo;s a ton of</p>
<p>money instead what I did was I basically in 2018 saw Bitcoin</p>
<p>from a US dollar price standpoint was falling and</p>
<p>falling and falling and in December 2018 as I take about</p>
<p>50% of my net worth and convert it from dollar denominated</p>
<p>assets into Bitcoin so it&rsquo;s a very kind of intentional</p>
<p>decision with a very specific view on the world as to like</p>
<p>why I was doing it I then essentially just let it sit</p>
<p>there grow whatever until the spring of 2020 and when I saw</p>
<p>the government step in and start to say hey we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>really be aggressive in terms of interest rate manipulation</p>
<p>and quantitative easing I then decided to go ahead and take</p>
<p>basically the remainder and start to convert it as well so</p>
<p>became very aggressive in doing that and so the way that I look</p>
<p>at it is that&rsquo;s actually my savings right and so in some</p>
<p>weird way if I said to you know what&rsquo;s the dollar worth you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>say well a one dollar bill is worth one dollar right Bitcoin</p>
<p>to me I denominate my wealth in Bitcoin so I think of one</p>
<p>Bitcoin is worth one Bitcoin not one Bitcoin is worth 60,000</p>
<p>or 55,000 or 70,000 right I denominated everything in</p>
<p>Bitcoin when I make a purchase in my head I&rsquo;m calculating how</p>
<p>much Bitcoin am I spending right now right well guess what</p>
<p>happens when you have a devaluing currency as the</p>
<p>denominator doesn&rsquo;t matter right like your financial</p>
<p>incentivize to spend or invest right to consume when you have</p>
<p>an appreciating currency all of a sudden you become much less</p>
<p>consumptive in your behavior yeah because you&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>trading off future purchasing power for the consumption today</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fascinating to think that if if when you move about this</p>
<p>world you think in Bitcoin you behave differently is if you</p>
<p>think in dollars that&rsquo;s really fascinating people but here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the thing is the last 50 years or so is actually the outlier</p>
<p>in history most people used to think this way yeah it&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>when a fiat currency got introduced that one argument the</p>
<p>positive argument or perspective is there was an</p>
<p>explosion in growth but really it&rsquo;s because there was a</p>
<p>financial incentive to consume yeah right and there&rsquo;s nobody</p>
<p>better in the world than the United States at consuming and</p>
<p>we consume anything and everything and if you want to</p>
<p>see a great example look at how big the coca colas are at</p>
<p>McDonald&rsquo;s right you know you go to other places they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>serve them that big and so the other example though or the</p>
<p>negative argument is we have to consume because if not you end</p>
<p>up being the bottom 45% of Americans that help no</p>
<p>investable assets and actually are just having their wealth</p>
<p>devalued away so holding the dollars end up being a very bad</p>
<p>economic decision and so when you then switch to this sound</p>
<p>money you say wait a second why would I if today I can trade</p>
<p>one Bitcoin you know back in October of last year one Bitcoin</p>
<p>for 10 thousand US dollars why would I spend that if at some</p>
<p>point in the future whether it&rsquo;s a month from now or 10</p>
<p>years from now I could trade it for something much much more</p>
<p>than that you just become much more of a anti consumer and</p>
<p>much more of a long term thinker yeah from the individual</p>
<p>perspective that&rsquo;s pretty powerful I wonder I mean I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s a interesting debate what&rsquo;s better for the</p>
<p>long term economy no better for the growth of the civilization</p>
<p>because capitalism is fascinating it seems to it seems</p>
<p>to work pretty well there&rsquo;s this kind of like Eric Weinstein</p>
<p>says that one of the problems is for the past several decades</p>
<p>this whole economy society is built on the idea that we have</p>
<p>to keep growing like it depends on that idea and it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good question whether that&rsquo;s going to result in huge</p>
<p>problems or if like a college student on a deadline the</p>
<p>the dependence on growth will mean that we&rsquo;ll have to grow</p>
<p>like the fear of death will force us to grow but I think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a false equivalency between we&rsquo;re dependent on</p>
<p>growth and then if the world was denominated in sound money</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t grow what I think ends up happening is we remove a</p>
<p>lot of the society&rsquo;s bullshit yeah because right now when the</p>
<p>money is free or the currency is free you come with all kinds</p>
<p>of crazy stuff and people will give it to you right when all</p>
<p>of a sudden it&rsquo;s really really valued by the population the</p>
<p>decisions are better yeah you you have to provide real value</p>
<p>in the goods and services you provide in order to get them to</p>
<p>give it to you there&rsquo;s less room for corruption less room</p>
<p>for manipulation that&rsquo;s and like that&rsquo;s not actually</p>
<p>productive yeah definitely so you said you moved a lot of</p>
<p>your investment into bitcoin is there when you look so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a special human being in many ways so you&rsquo;re like a strategic</p>
<p>thinker but you&rsquo;re also like a deep thinker about this whole</p>
<p>thing but when you look at a regular club like me in terms</p>
<p>of just investing and moving into thinking about</p>
<p>cryptocurrency is there a strategy that you recommend</p>
<p>what are the different options about investing into bitcoin</p>
<p>yeah so i think that there&rsquo;s just uh kind of timeless advice</p>
<p>when it comes to uh investing or or acquiring an asset in</p>
<p>general uh dollar cost averaging is usually the the</p>
<p>best way to think about it and what i mean by that is um most</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t just have a pile of uh currency sitting there</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s not like they have a million dollars sitting in</p>
<p>their bank like what do i do with it uh that situation aside</p>
<p>what happens is they trade their hours and their effort for</p>
<p>currency and so as they get paid every two weeks let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>um the best way to acquire bitcoin without having to worry about timing</p>
<p>markets and being a professional trader is to simply take whatever the</p>
<p>percentages that you want and to buy bitcoin when you get your</p>
<p>paycheck so if you get paid on the first and 15th of every month</p>
<p>on that day you should go take you know let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s three percent of your</p>
<p>paycheck take three percent go buy bitcoin don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worry about what the price is you should do that over time and the</p>
<p>reason why that&rsquo;s important is um if in december of 2017 when bitcoin</p>
<p>is at twenty thousand dollars it was the height of kind of this last</p>
<p>uh big upwards movement you had taken all of your money</p>
<p>and you had put it into bitcoin you would have had to wait almost three</p>
<p>years just to get back to quote unquote break even</p>
<p>in us dollar terms if at the same time you had simply bought then and over the</p>
<p>next three years bought every two weeks you would have been up hundreds of</p>
<p>percent three years later because what ended up</p>
<p>happening was you bought a bunch of bitcoin when it was at</p>
<p>15 12 10 9 8 3 4 5 5 5 you know all the way back up on the</p>
<p>other side and so dollar cost averaging is one of</p>
<p>these weird things that uh it almost sounds too easy but what we</p>
<p>find is in america we have a lack of financial education</p>
<p>and so rather than try to be smarter than markets what most people are better</p>
<p>off doing is just saying hey set your what&rsquo;s called an asset</p>
<p>allocation plan i want 30 in stocks i want 10 in real</p>
<p>estate i want this this whatever and every time you get your paycheck</p>
<p>just think of it as a savings account right just put it in</p>
<p>based on those percentages and don&rsquo;t think about it</p>
<p>and over a long enough period of time what we find is</p>
<p>almost anyone in the united states right there&rsquo;s exceptions but almost anyone in</p>
<p>the united states can become a millionaire in their</p>
<p>lifetime if they follow these plans and have that long term view and they allow</p>
<p>compounding to work for them and so don&rsquo;t look at the price of</p>
<p>bitcoin and all that kind of stuff just pick a</p>
<p>specific time specific day that you just buy</p>
<p>and you just keep buying that&rsquo;s probably good investment advice across any kind</p>
<p>of assets it&rsquo;s like if you don&rsquo;t believe in</p>
<p>bitcoin and you just want to let&rsquo;s say you just want to do the s&amp;p 500</p>
<p>yeah you shouldn&rsquo;t try to time the market of the s&amp;p 500 either right you</p>
<p>should just every two weeks you should just buy some</p>
<p>and over a 20 year period you&rsquo;re gonna end up buying it at all kinds</p>
<p>of different prices but you&rsquo;re gonna get kind of a blended average</p>
<p>and the more important thing is the compounding and the time in the market</p>
<p>then did you buy it at you know two percent higher or lower than where you</p>
<p>bought it doesn&rsquo;t really matter and buying often makes you i guess</p>
<p>uh resistant robust to the uh to the volatility of the market or the</p>
<p>volatility of bitcoin price and so on that said uh you know bitcoin price</p>
<p>is volatile and you know again the argument i&rsquo;ve heard</p>
<p>is like everything that&rsquo;s going to be a lot more valuable in the future</p>
<p>like if you look at the history like companies like apple like teslas</p>
<p>now i mean but let&rsquo;s look at companies that</p>
<p>have now stabilized right uh apple is a good example</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like volatile in the beginning and so the argument for bitcoin is like</p>
<p>yeah this is the early stages because it&rsquo;s going to be a lot more valuable</p>
<p>right now it&rsquo;s volatile and this is why you have to have these kinds of</p>
<p>strategies to ride out the volatility of course everything that goes to zero is</p>
<p>also volatile like the early days are volatile uh</p>
<p>do you see like this volatility as like a feature or a bug</p>
<p>or is this just like a way of life so amazon is the one that i know the</p>
<p>numbers on in terms of early volatility uh every year since it has gone public</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s had a double digit drawdown in that year uh the average</p>
<p>is over 30 percent and one time it drew down over 95 percent</p>
<p>sounds a lot like bitcoin right like oh wow this is crazy</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s one of the best performing stocks in the last 20 years if not the</p>
<p>best performing stock and so volatility is not positive or</p>
<p>negative it&rsquo;s positive or negative compared to the</p>
<p>position you&rsquo;re in so if you&rsquo;re long and it&rsquo;s volatile to the</p>
<p>upside it&rsquo;s positive if you&rsquo;re long holding something and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s volatile to the downside you see it as a negative it&rsquo;s all about</p>
<p>perspective with that said um another way that i</p>
<p>look at this is every asset priced in bitcoin</p>
<p>is down significantly so over the last one</p>
<p>three five years the dollar priced in bitcoin</p>
<p>has crashed 99 percent if you denominate stocks it&rsquo;s down like</p>
<p>80 85 if you denominate gold if you</p>
<p>denominate bonds if you just go down the line real estate etc</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all down massively against bitcoin now you could argue that that&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>bitcoin is appreciating in us dollar terms</p>
<p>or you could actually argue that the world is</p>
<p>repricing this asset it&rsquo;s doing price discovery on this asset</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s essentially comparing it&rsquo;s saying hey bitcoin verse</p>
<p>this stock or bitcoin verse this ounce of gold or bitcoin verse</p>
<p>you know this dollar which is more valuable and it continues to move up in</p>
<p>the rankings in terms of the value that the world</p>
<p>ascribes to this some of that&rsquo;s based on lindy effect just</p>
<p>the longer it persists the more likely it is to survive some of that&rsquo;s based on</p>
<p>like the underlying fundamentals of how much computing power the usage</p>
<p>transaction volume things like that but some of it also is that as more</p>
<p>and more people wake up to the fact that it&rsquo;s a finite supply asset that has a</p>
<p>place in the world and demand increases people just naturally</p>
<p>compete and ascribe more value to it and so the</p>
<p>volatility i think all comes back to like what do you</p>
<p>price your life in for majority people that&rsquo;s dollars</p>
<p>and so you look at the us dollar price you get all this volatility</p>
<p>the beauty of this is that 60 that doesn&rsquo;t move regardless of</p>
<p>price upward or downward and movement those people aren&rsquo;t looking at the day</p>
<p>to day price what they&rsquo;ve basically said is i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>acquired x amount of bitcoin and i&rsquo;m just going to hold it for years</p>
<p>and every time somebody&rsquo;s done that right if if uh you bought bitcoin at any point</p>
<p>in the last 12 years and you held it till today you are up in us dollar terms</p>
<p>now if we had this conversation 18 months ago couldn&rsquo;t say that</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s all about not only the acquisition</p>
<p>price if you will it&rsquo;s also when are you looking at it</p>
<p>right because there was a point in 2017 you could have said the same thing but</p>
<p>in 18 you couldn&rsquo;t and so i tend to think a lot about um</p>
<p>humans are really really bad at short term</p>
<p>uh decision making because we&rsquo;re so emotional</p>
<p>especially when something has a price tied to it and so it&rsquo;s in terms of our</p>
<p>strategies and decision making we should be long term and have like a</p>
<p>regular almost think like an algorithm that</p>
<p>in that in that kind of way so i think you&rsquo;ve tweeted that</p>
<p>you believe that bitcoin has a chance of reaching 1 million i don&rsquo;t know what it</p>
<p>is currently i think it&rsquo;s five the 60s which is incredible</p>
<p>i think i remember when it was at least in the double digits i think i remember</p>
<p>it was in the signal digits of a dollar so the fact that it&rsquo;s cross 50 is crazy</p>
<p>uh but uh you&rsquo;re even crazier apparently thinking that it can reach a million</p>
<p>so do you think it&rsquo;s possible for it to reach a million is there some kind of</p>
<p>transformative effects we have to see first</p>
<p>when might it reach a million like what are the signs that we would look for</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s required for it to reach a million so let&rsquo;s just look at it from a macro</p>
<p>perspective uh gold is a 10 trillion dollar asset</p>
<p>and when you compare the technology of gold to the technology of bitcoin</p>
<p>bitcoin is superior in every single way right it&rsquo;s more portable it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>divisible uh it&rsquo;s more verifiable it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>scarce on everything and so some people would argue it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>10x improvement some people argue it&rsquo;s 100x improvement from a technology</p>
<p>standpoint and so we don&rsquo;t need bitcoin to</p>
<p>actually kind of um capture the full 10x or 100x</p>
<p>improvement from a market cap standpoint if bitcoin simply captures</p>
<p>2x the value be a 20 trillion dollar market cap</p>
<p>which would put bitcoin at about a million dollars</p>
<p>right so kind of just from a macro perspective if you have a 10x or 100x</p>
<p>improvement from a technology standpoint and you directionally get some value</p>
<p>capture in that direction you&rsquo;re hitting around a million or more</p>
<p>uh dollar price point can ask a quick question which is uh</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the current market cap for bitcoin uh the current market cap is</p>
<p>right around a trillion just over a trillion dollars and you&rsquo;re saying gold</p>
<p>is 10 trillion and uh sorry where did you get the 20</p>
<p>trillion 20 trillion would just be 2x gold market cap</p>
<p>got it right so if it&rsquo;s a 10x technology improvement let&rsquo;s just say it only</p>
<p>captures 2x the market cap got it right and so again if it was to</p>
<p>capture just gold market cap kind of the equivalent</p>
<p>puts you around 500 000 right so you can kind of see there&rsquo;s bitcoin</p>
<p>so if you capture the entirety of the gold market</p>
<p>uh then it would be value of a single bitcoin uh the price of a single bitcoin</p>
<p>would be five hundred thousand dollars okay</p>
<p>to reach a million it would be double that that&rsquo;s what the 20 trillion comes</p>
<p>from correct got it so if you then say to yourself</p>
<p>okay how does the uh the pricing um kind of cycles work right or the</p>
<p>boom and bust cycles gold is a very um</p>
<p>kind of linear type supply schedule meaning that</p>
<p>uh there is a certain amount of gold that comes out of the ground each year</p>
<p>the interyear variation in that incoming supply is not much</p>
<p>right maybe there&rsquo;s an extra mining company that gets set up or a couple of</p>
<p>them maybe one goes out of business but for the</p>
<p>most part the kind of inflationary uh increase to the supply of gold</p>
<p>is pretty stagnant uh year over year bitcoin has a very unique feature which</p>
<p>every four years there is a programmatic supply shock</p>
<p>meaning that uh in the beginning 50 bitcoin every 10 minutes was introduced</p>
<p>into the supply after four years of that happening every</p>
<p>10 minutes it was cut in half so on a in a single</p>
<p>moment it went from 50 to now it was 25 four years every 10 minutes 25 got cut</p>
<p>in half again to 12 and a half and then recently in may 2020 got cut to 6.25</p>
<p>when you have an asset that is determined the price</p>
<p>based on supply and demand you normally have</p>
<p>two inputs to the equation what is the supply and what is the demand</p>
<p>in an asset like gold or a stock or anything else</p>
<p>we have to do our best guess at the supply</p>
<p>both the existing supply and the incoming supply and do our best guess at</p>
<p>the demand and we&rsquo;re actually pretty good at this a lot of times in terms of</p>
<p>directionally saying it&rsquo;s going to go up or down and here&rsquo;s kind of some price</p>
<p>point milestones bitcoin&rsquo;s unique in that there&rsquo;s 100</p>
<p>verifiable proof of the existing supply</p>
<p>the total supply and the incoming daily supply</p>
<p>so we know 100 i can show you on the actual blockchain</p>
<p>or in the code that there&rsquo;s 21 million bitcoin and that&rsquo;s all there will ever</p>
<p>be i can show you that there&rsquo;s 18.6 million</p>
<p>give or take bitcoin that actually are in circulation</p>
<p>today right and i can go all the way back to every single transaction that&rsquo;s ever</p>
<p>occurred since january 2009 and then i can show you on a daily</p>
<p>basis that 900 bitcoin a day are coming into the circulating supply</p>
<p>and so when you have 100 confidence because you can prove</p>
<p>the supply side of this equation you can hold it constant</p>
<p>i know with 100 accuracy the supply side so now i&rsquo;ve reduced the mathematical</p>
<p>equation that i need to do to determine price movements</p>
<p>to a 50 reduction i only have to worry about demand i don&rsquo;t have to worry about</p>
<p>supply and so when i look at demand i can do</p>
<p>all kinds of things i can take the demand over the last 10 years and</p>
<p>the growth and just extrapolate it out i can increase it i can decrease it</p>
<p>whatever but what you find is that these supply</p>
<p>shocks lead to significant price appreciation</p>
<p>as the asset gets repriced because there there&rsquo;s a supply shock to</p>
<p>and so probably the best thing that i&rsquo;ve done over the last couple of years</p>
<p>was in 2019 i started to talk about the idea that we were going to have both a</p>
<p>supply shock and the demand shock in 2021</p>
<p>or i&rsquo;m sorry in 2020 i didn&rsquo;t know when this bull market that we were in was</p>
<p>going to end nobody knows right it&rsquo;s impossible to time</p>
<p>these things but you could tell that we were kind of at late stages of a cycle</p>
<p>there was inverted yield curves there was rep uh gyrations in the repo markets</p>
<p>a lot of ceos leaving their jobs you know all this kind of stuff</p>
<p>and all i said was at some point when the market turns over</p>
<p>the government&rsquo;s gonna have to step in we were addicted to stimulus they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to manipulate interest rates down and they&rsquo;re gonna have to print</p>
<p>money i had no clue that there was going to be a global</p>
<p>pandemic that they were going to have to step in</p>
<p>in such an aggressive way and move rates not down but down to zero</p>
<p>and that they not only were going to print hundreds of billions but they could</p>
<p>print trillions of dollars but the framework that i used to think</p>
<p>about this was when they do that everyone is going to</p>
<p>run to store value assets they&rsquo;re going to run the gold they&rsquo;re going to run the</p>
<p>bitcoin etc and right as they do that it appears at</p>
<p>the same time there&rsquo;s going to be this supply shock</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re gonna get a supply shock and a demand shock that are both positive for</p>
<p>the the price i called it rocket fuel for bitcoin</p>
<p>well it happened and here we are i now look forward and i say okay we are</p>
<p>likely going to see a hundred thousand bitcoin</p>
<p>a hundred thousand dollar bitcoin this year or at some point i don&rsquo;t know when</p>
<p>it happens but we&rsquo;re moving in that so you think in 2021 we&rsquo;ll see a hundred</p>
<p>thousand that would be uh my most conservative</p>
<p>view uh i i&rsquo;ve said a hundred thousand dollars</p>
<p>since 2019 and people thought that was insane and</p>
<p>crazy and all stuff now i&rsquo;m the conservative guy in the room</p>
<p>because i stick with a hundred thousand dollars and people are saying</p>
<p>you know multiples of that number here uh so we&rsquo;ll see what happens but</p>
<p>but i think that there&rsquo;s still a lot of room kind of to run from a us dollar</p>
<p>price standpoint what is on the horizon is in 2024 we</p>
<p>will have another supply shock and so that&rsquo;s what i think will carry</p>
<p>us to the million dollar bitcoin from 6 to 5 to whatever 50 reduction yeah</p>
<p>yeah and so that&rsquo;s what i think uh well</p>
<p>basically when we get that that next supply shock that&rsquo;ll carry us up over a</p>
<p>hundred or over a one million dollar bitcoin price which if historical</p>
<p>examples persist and again sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to use historical examples to</p>
<p>look at future events um but if that happens we would see</p>
<p>a million dollars of bitcoin by the end of 2026</p>
<p>after that wave so 2024 basically is the supply shock and within</p>
<p>you know 18 to 24 months you would see the uh</p>
<p>the kind of top of the next market hopefully without a coupling to the net</p>
<p>to another pandemic yes we we would like to do all of this without a</p>
<p>public health crisis so that would take it to</p>
<p>20 trillion you don&rsquo;t have to compare it to the dollar</p>
<p>essentially in some sense that the dollar could also lose value i mean</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of kind of dynamics at play here</p>
<p>now but like fundamentally there&rsquo;s going to be a huge</p>
<p>move uh in your prediction of uh value into into bitcoin</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s a fascinating world uh to think about</p>
<p>uh i mean but i do have to kind of ask you about the whole space of</p>
<p>technology there because we&rsquo;re talking about the value of security we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about the the future which bitcoin will be at the</p>
<p>center of but from my perspective of</p>
<p>thinking how like i and others can build technologies on top of</p>
<p>this kind of decentralized world i&rsquo;m thinking about different</p>
<p>different technologies out there different cryptocurrencies out there</p>
<p>ethereum being one but there&rsquo;s a lot of others</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;d love to get your sort of ideas about some of these but</p>
<p>so first let me ask you about what the hell is shit coin</p>
<p>is this connected to uh to our previous discussion of the meme</p>
<p>uh this shit coin cover basically all coins that are not</p>
<p>bitcoin is it uh uh mean is it a beautiful is it&rsquo;s a mixture of</p>
<p>both as with most things in life uh depends</p>
<p>who you ask um the uh most um</p>
<p>kind of enthusiastic and uh uh parts of the bitcoin community shit</p>
<p>coin is anything else right kind of if you ascribe to kind</p>
<p>of a maximalistic view of the world shit crime be anything if you look at</p>
<p>people who i would say are bitcoin proponents uh yet</p>
<p>see value in other things shit coin may be the bottom half</p>
<p>of the other things right so i think again it&rsquo;s really important kind of who</p>
<p>you ask is how you&rsquo;ll get that answer so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s tiers and the way you divide those tiers might be different depending</p>
<p>who you ask ultimately what it is is it&rsquo;s a meme yeah</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s used to uh articulate the idea that whatever you want to put in</p>
<p>that bucket has no value so shit coin right are coins that have</p>
<p>no value yeah uh what is fascinating about it and i</p>
<p>think that again speaks to the power of the bitcoin community</p>
<p>is uh there was congressional hearings a couple years ago</p>
<p>oh no and at one point uh a congressman from ohio warren davidson who uh</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s definitely uh open minded and excited about bitcoin</p>
<p>asked a an individual on the congress floor</p>
<p>uh during testimony to uh talk about these other coins and at one point</p>
<p>basically read into the record the terminology of shit coin</p>
<p>he said the word shit coin uh i can&rsquo;t remember if he said it first</p>
<p>somebody else did or if uh the other person did and then he uh um</p>
<p>you know repeated it that&rsquo;s awesome but he definitely he was trying to get that</p>
<p>read into the record yes uh for sure and so uh you know you</p>
<p>can imagine one again the meme speaking insolently to</p>
<p>the bitcoin community was you know made him very uh very well</p>
<p>liked uh but also too was um it does go back to this idea almost of</p>
<p>uh if you and i sat down with 10 ceos and we interviewed each one of them and</p>
<p>then we went in a room and we deliberated and we said we have to pick</p>
<p>the person who&rsquo;s going to be the most successful</p>
<p>one of the inputs not all the inputs but one of the inputs would be</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the person who we believe has the best ability to</p>
<p>raise capital recruit people and tell a story</p>
<p>to the world that will get them to follow and so somebody like elon would</p>
<p>probably be the best example of this when you have decentralized products you</p>
<p>have no kind of leader right in the sense of somebody who is</p>
<p>financially ascribed to be that leader and kind of the</p>
<p>executive decision maker so what you have to do is you have to</p>
<p>look at these technologies in these communities and say</p>
<p>well which volunteer teams or which technologies have been able to coalesce</p>
<p>these groups around it and in some way build the same level of</p>
<p>engagement and protection and things like that and so</p>
<p>you actually get tribalism but you also get things like</p>
<p>shitcoin because what it does is it&rsquo;s not only a um</p>
<p>kind of verbal attack towards uh others it&rsquo;s a rallying cry for</p>
<p>internal what&rsquo;s so funny is that it was started with the bitcoin community</p>
<p>talking about everybody but now you&rsquo;ve seen adoption in other communities who</p>
<p>use it you know basically say well we&rsquo;re not a</p>
<p>shitcoin it&rsquo;s the it&rsquo;s the next guy yeah i mean the meaning to be honest</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s one it&rsquo;s off it&rsquo;s sometimes</p>
<p>misused i think like with anything it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>people adopt memes that used to be brilliant or still brilliant</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just not good at using them so they become</p>
<p>mean uh but when you do with with grace it can tear down an</p>
<p>argument and at the same time have like love and</p>
<p>respect underneath it i mean it&rsquo;s a beautiful dance they have to be good at</p>
<p>like you know people just can suck at communication and even</p>
<p>uh like even a powerful weapon like a meme in the wrong hands</p>
<p>just uh fires in a way that doesn&rsquo;t get anything done but this is like a war</p>
<p>of humor and memes it&rsquo;s kind of fascinating exactly like you formulated</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a symmetry of power so you have to</p>
<p>have guerrilla warfare in this internet game especially when there&rsquo;s no leader</p>
<p>like you said in a distributed culture i would say here that is um</p>
<p>is really important i think is from a society standpoint</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve become very soft and very kind of coddling and not in um</p>
<p>not in a way that&rsquo;s like i think people take this argument like too far</p>
<p>sometimes but what i mean by that is um it&rsquo;s almost like if you&rsquo;re the person</p>
<p>who holds somebody accountable you become the bad person right if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the person who um says hey you know that&rsquo;s wrong you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the bad person right and so in a world where i think in um</p>
<p>this kind of influencery you know all positive if you have any negative</p>
<p>you know feedback or constructive criticism like you&rsquo;re the bad person</p>
<p>uh it&rsquo;s the ultimate echo chamber right and so i think that what the bitcoin</p>
<p>world does in in some crazy crazy way to look</p>
<p>at it is bitcoin is ultimately about truth</p>
<p>not about narrative not about feelings or emotion it&rsquo;s math yeah</p>
<p>you look at a blockchain and you can prove something</p>
<p>or you can&rsquo;t and so naturally people who are attracted to that</p>
<p>have a very similar approach in life yeah right they say hey</p>
<p>you made x claim prove it and as you can imagine</p>
<p>you know a great example is like the financial media meets bitcoiners</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a bloodbath right in kind of the the arena of ideas because</p>
<p>what do they do the financial media is used to the soft</p>
<p>you know opinion pieces etc and bitcoiners show up and they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>uh here&rsquo;s data point a b and c here&rsquo;s example one two and three</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re wrong and then all they yell and scream about is like</p>
<p>uh i&rsquo;m wrong i&rsquo;m wrong i&rsquo;m wrong like you can&rsquo;t say i&rsquo;m wrong and they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>nerd like disprove what i just said and so you get in this like very very weird</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fascinating it&rsquo;s a fascinating battlefield but</p>
<p>i i do want to say it&rsquo;s i&rsquo;ve been watching this</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of interesting i think that the pursuit of truth</p>
<p>like tearing down bad ideas can be done with grace and to do it with</p>
<p>grace requires a lot of skill like what people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t realize about disagreement they think that disagreement is easy</p>
<p>like they they see the the the lies or the inaccuracies in the</p>
<p>statement and and they just think they can say</p>
<p>wrong uh yes you can say that but if you want</p>
<p>to be effective it requires great skill like you look at</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know um a beautiful uh verbal shit poster which is Christopher</p>
<p>Hitchens right it requires a lot of skill</p>
<p>through your words to tear down an argument</p>
<p>to criticize and to take a step towards truth</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;m disheartened by internet culture like the negative side</p>
<p>is people don&rsquo;t put a lot of effort in their tear downs</p>
<p>like into your shit posting into your memes</p>
<p>you should put effort and see it as a skill that you want to if you want to be</p>
<p>a part of this culture you want to uh get good at it</p>
<p>like any skill it&rsquo;s the 10 000 hours like get improve deliberate practice</p>
<p>self criticism all of those things uh just because you&rsquo;re anonymous</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean you won&rsquo;t get deep joy and actually have an impact on the world if</p>
<p>you get good at shitposting but but i think this is really really</p>
<p>important right because you&rsquo;re right in that</p>
<p>uh it&rsquo;s all about intention versus action if your intention is to</p>
<p>uh tell somebody that they are wrong in an effort to get them to</p>
<p>see the truth yes that&rsquo;s very different than if your intention is to tell</p>
<p>someone they&rsquo;re wrong and hurt their feelings yes</p>
<p>right and so when you can unpack intention and action</p>
<p>you really quickly can tell what somebody ultimately is trying to</p>
<p>accomplish i also think that one of the craziest</p>
<p>things that i&rsquo;ve seen play out is uh memes when i use that term i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>just talking about like a static photo right when i&rsquo;m talking about these</p>
<p>elaborate uh kind of edited videos and kind of</p>
<p>all this stuff um when done right it is</p>
<p>uh the most articulate way to deliver a blunt message and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>done in such a way that is humorous and entertaining</p>
<p>yet really hammers the point home and so it&rsquo;s a skill set that many people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have i don&rsquo;t make those i&rsquo;m assuming you don&rsquo;t make them either</p>
<p>right i see them i share the ones that i like right</p>
<p>uh but it does take practice and you can tell</p>
<p>look there&rsquo;s people who are fantastic meme lords right and there are</p>
<p>people who absolutely suck at it and it&rsquo;s like anything it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>how good are you at communicating and uh i&rsquo;ve heard the idea a bunch of times so</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know who to kind of credit for it but uh whether it&rsquo;s emojis</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gifs it&rsquo;s memes whatever this is the extension and evolution of</p>
<p>just hieroglyphics right yeah like like we have been doing</p>
<p>this for literally centuries it&rsquo;s just that now we&rsquo;re doing it on</p>
<p>the internet you can press a button and go to</p>
<p>millions and millions of people immediately uh but speaking of memes</p>
<p>what the heck do you think is up with elon musk talking about dogecoin a lot</p>
<p>sort of uh from the cryptocurrency community i</p>
<p>from i&rsquo;ve been talking to a lot of sort of technologists i guess</p>
<p>and reading papers on cryptocurrency it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>nobody really sees dogecoin as a revolutionary</p>
<p>crypto technology a lot of people talk about it&rsquo;s security issues there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of issues it has nevertheless you did say that money is the</p>
<p>kind of social construct right and uh elon musk&rsquo;s</p>
<p>combination of humor and brilliant engineering in the various</p>
<p>companies he runs combines to create a kind of value</p>
<p>and excitement behind dogecoin it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>um what is it he says uh that the most amusing outcome is the most likely</p>
<p>kind of idea which sounds silly but there could be like profound truth to it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like what do you make of dogecoin philosophically or technically is is it</p>
<p>possible that dogecoin will overtake bitcoin and run the</p>
<p>run the entire world i can&rsquo;t even because it could happen</p>
<p>it could happen but what uh if there&rsquo;s any serious way to answer that question</p>
<p>well we have to start with uh techno king of tesla yeah and master of coin</p>
<p>as they are so articulately called in the latest scc filing</p>
<p>he officially changed his title techno king yes no king of tesla</p>
<p>and the cfo&rsquo;s new uh title is a master of coin</p>
<p>and so uh when you have a sense of humor yeah and frankly uh a level of uh</p>
<p>self confidence and uh an element of uh an appreciation for irony in the world</p>
<p>dogecoin is actually one of the least crazy things that you could talk about</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re willing to go to techno king of tesla master of coin</p>
<p>uh and all this stuff and so i think that</p>
<p>elon uh doesn&rsquo;t get enough credit frankly for his understanding of internet</p>
<p>culture understanding of memes and understanding</p>
<p>of frankly human psychology and marketing and so</p>
<p>in some crazy way every time he talks about dogecoin</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a rallying cry for an entire generation of kids</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a rallying cry for an entire industry uh in terms of cryptocurrencies</p>
<p>and digital technologies but this is the flag yeah</p>
<p>and this is the thing that he can yell and scream about</p>
<p>and tweet about without worry of punishment</p>
<p>so he could be talking about bitcoin he could be talking about cryptocurrency</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not going to be uh as beautifully</p>
<p>humorous and whatever the hell internet culture is as dogecoin</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s finding the right language he&rsquo;s speaking the language of the people</p>
<p>of the of the in the digital age if you want to reach weird people</p>
<p>yeah you can&rsquo;t be serious and most people are weird</p>
<p>the masses are weird so he&rsquo;s speaking to the masses</p>
<p>yeah and the techno king and even further than that i think is</p>
<p>he essentially is um he&rsquo;s using dogecoin as a way to say</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m doing this because i can yeah he couldn&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>with securities he couldn&rsquo;t do it with certain types of other assets right</p>
<p>like i almost look at it as like a venn diagram what&rsquo;s the thing that a bunch of</p>
<p>people know about care about thinkers funny whatever and</p>
<p>also overlay that with the things that like he</p>
<p>could actually talk about they won&rsquo;t get in trouble for</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a big f you to the sec i could see the</p>
<p>the people just freaking out i i mean i love it</p>
<p>but um i i don&rsquo;t know if i would have the guts to do it myself</p>
<p>but i i think he&rsquo;s an inspiration to a lot of us</p>
<p>to be like well maybe you should grow the guts</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re the techno king you can do whatever you want right</p>
<p>and i mean that&rsquo;s something to aspire to is to be the techno king in your own</p>
<p>little world if you also think about it in the sense</p>
<p>of uh when you&rsquo;re somebody on a mission to create interplanetary</p>
<p>life yeah when you&rsquo;re trying to solve a or put a dent in the climate crisis</p>
<p>or create electric vehicles and be the first american company and you know</p>
<p>however long frankly the sec</p>
<p>or other things in your life that just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t ascribe that much importance to compared to those things</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re almost uh nuisances and that&rsquo;s scary i think for shareholders</p>
<p>of a company when the person that you&rsquo;re trusting to lead</p>
<p>you to the promised land and create shareholder value</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t put value on certain things but at the same time</p>
<p>i always look at it as a tug of war how much of the actions of what he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>and calling attention to actually change the way</p>
<p>that regulators lawmakers politicians countries whatever act he may not be</p>
<p>able to say do acts i&rsquo;m the techno king and they go do it</p>
<p>but with every step he makes he changes some of their behavior and so i</p>
<p>think that it&rsquo;s um a really kind of game of like 3d chess</p>
<p>that frankly i&rsquo;m not privy to right i&rsquo;m kind of watching from the sidelines and</p>
<p>uh figuring out alongside everybody else but i also don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>elon uh bought a bunch of dogecoin and tweets about it because he thinks he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to a dollar and he&rsquo;s gonna you know make money right like i don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s an economic argument as to why he&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>interested in i think it&rsquo;s much more uh it&rsquo;s almost like meta message</p>
<p>for a lot of other stuff yeah he&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>trying to break apart internet communication from first principles like</p>
<p>it does so many other problems it&rsquo;s kind of fascinating to watch i know he&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>uh he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s taught me quite a bit about communication</p>
<p>and uh at least for me it&rsquo;s been liberating to not give a fuck</p>
<p>about the old school way of things i&rsquo;ve been always bothered by</p>
<p>a place i deeply admire which is mit but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>problems the bureaucracies and hierarchies that hold back innovation</p>
<p>brilliant minds and in that sense doge is a kind of fu to</p>
<p>the system that&rsquo;s kind of positive but also</p>
<p>uh kind of uh but it was also an fu so in that sense i think</p>
<p>elon has a perspective on the world that&rsquo;s similar to bitcoin folks</p>
<p>which i really like which is like thinking long term</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s how visionaries think is like how will if i take these ideas</p>
<p>what and the ideas hold true what will the world look like in 20 30</p>
<p>50 years and think about everything in that way</p>
<p>yeah i like uh bezos&rsquo;s view which is uh is essentially how do you minimize</p>
<p>regret how do you accelerate your life mentally</p>
<p>and go to 80 90 100 150 years whatever we end up</p>
<p>being you know fortunate enough to live to and then look backwards</p>
<p>yes and say this decision that i&rsquo;m going to make i have two</p>
<p>options which one is going to be the one that i least regret</p>
<p>and if you continue to make decisions that way</p>
<p>one you have that long term view kind of built in because you&rsquo;re working</p>
<p>backwards uh two you are ultimately going to optimize</p>
<p>for uh minimal regret but also three is</p>
<p>even if you only look forward 10 years that&rsquo;s much much further than most</p>
<p>people do and so it gives you a significant</p>
<p>advantage and i think that um bitcoin has kind of this like um</p>
<p>you know proxy for time as we talked about uh</p>
<p>interplant uh planetary travel where there&rsquo;s multiple steps from creating a</p>
<p>reusable rocket to landing it to you know all this stuff all the way</p>
<p>to simple things just like if you&rsquo;re simply trying to figure out</p>
<p>where the world&rsquo;s going to be 30 years from now</p>
<p>you know bill gates says that we overestimate what we can do in one year</p>
<p>underestimate what we can do in 10 well to me it&rsquo;s a um kind of degree of</p>
<p>uh mistake if you will 10 years maybe you&rsquo;re off by 10 percent</p>
<p>well if that line of progress continues 20 years you may be off by</p>
<p>100 and 30 years you may be off by a thousand percent</p>
<p>right like almost the further you go out the more inaccurate you become</p>
<p>and so i think that people who want to iterate their way to success right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a common thing in like the startup world</p>
<p>end up actually following kind of the breadcrumbs to where the</p>
<p>world is taking them but people like an elon musk a jeff</p>
<p>bezos a jack dorsey all the way down the line all these</p>
<p>innovators they actually say to themselves there is</p>
<p>a point in time in the future where there&rsquo;s a world i want to</p>
<p>construct and then they go and they construct it</p>
<p>regardless of the short term iterations and incentives</p>
<p>it is just they&rsquo;re driving towards that point and i think that it&rsquo;s this whole</p>
<p>idea of having this like you know kind of set vision and this</p>
<p>uh refusal to kind of move or budge off of that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what makes them special one of the</p>
<p>things that garnered a lot of excitement in the crypto</p>
<p>community is nfts i i have no idea really the depths the</p>
<p>fundamental technological philosophical depths of the second of this technology</p>
<p>whether this is just like a little bit of a fad or there&rsquo;s some deep lessons to</p>
<p>learn whether it&rsquo;s bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general about it</p>
<p>do you have thoughts about like the long lasting fundamental aspects of nfts</p>
<p>i think there&rsquo;s probably both things happening fad</p>
<p>and things to learn right and um if we just start with like what is an</p>
<p>nft it&rsquo;s a non fungible token meaning that um there&rsquo;s no fungibility</p>
<p>and fungibility is a fancy word um i always describe it as</p>
<p>if i took a hundred dollar bill and i put it on the table with a bunch of the</p>
<p>hundred dollar bills and we mixed them up and i just grabbed a hundred dollar</p>
<p>bill and left i&rsquo;m no worse as long as they&rsquo;re all you</p>
<p>know uh official hundred dollar bills because as long as i have a hundred</p>
<p>dollars i have hundred dollars i don&rsquo;t need that exact same bill back</p>
<p>so that means that those hundred dollar bills are fungible</p>
<p>non fungible would be like art if i took a picasso and i put it down on the table</p>
<p>and you brought three artists that no one&rsquo;s ever heard of before and we mixed</p>
<p>them up and i just took any random piece of art</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t the picasso i lose because the picasso is really</p>
<p>important there right so non fungibility is important in art</p>
<p>what these non fungible tokens essentially are doing is they are uh</p>
<p>creating scarcity and originality in a digital environment and what i mean by</p>
<p>that is um take a music file if i had a music</p>
<p>file and you wanted it you said send it to me</p>
<p>i press send it essentially creates a copy and you get one music file i get</p>
<p>another we don&rsquo;t care you can listen to music i</p>
<p>can listen to music we&rsquo;re super happy if i instead though have a digital file</p>
<p>that entire premise is based on scarcity and i hit send and you get a copy and i</p>
<p>keep the original or you get the original i get a copy</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a problem and so ultimately what i think is playing out with nfts is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a technology regardless of where it plays out from</p>
<p>blockchains or uh what in communities or environments</p>
<p>that just brings true digital scarcity to the internet and so naturally what</p>
<p>people do they look at the legacy world and they</p>
<p>say well what&rsquo;s scarce there that has value</p>
<p>how do we bring that to the digital world so art is a perfect example right</p>
<p>and you know frankly last year i started to</p>
<p>look at this because it felt like this was going to be really really big</p>
<p>and the conclusion i came to was just as bitcoin is going to be bigger</p>
<p>than gold right the digital application of</p>
<p>something is going to be bigger than the analog application</p>
<p>the same thing&rsquo;s going to be true in art the digital art world is going to be</p>
<p>bigger than the traditional art world people think that sounds crazy at first</p>
<p>until you start to realize it&rsquo;s very very similar the art is more</p>
<p>portable it can be divisible right it&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>larger demand market in terms of the internet rather than an auction right</p>
<p>all this kind of stuff when you display it it can have motion</p>
<p>and music and all of these aspects to it that are better than the traditional</p>
<p>art what the traditional art market has that</p>
<p>the digital art market has not had is the narrative narrative based world</p>
<p>scarcity kind of in digital sense and so what i think the entire world is</p>
<p>going through right now is an exploration of how do we use this</p>
<p>technology to create new things frankly</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not going to be good at it for a while</p>
<p>and so the only place i&rsquo;ve really focused on is</p>
<p>digital art itself and i&rsquo;ve always been interested in art but i wasn&rsquo;t going to</p>
<p>go buy a painting and hang it on the wall</p>
<p>right in the sense of uh that&rsquo;s how i was going to store value</p>
<p>what i find fascinating though is that i now can take</p>
<p>that concept which most of the wealthiest people in the world</p>
<p>have a significant portion some you know some people have 20 percent in terms of</p>
<p>you know number of billionaires 20 percent of their wealth is in art</p>
<p>and you can bring to this digital realm which is much more um</p>
<p>kind of natural to a digital native and so the best way to describe the</p>
<p>importance is imagine a serial number being placed on</p>
<p>something take the eiffel tower the only eiffel</p>
<p>tower that has value is the first one every replica of it regardless of size</p>
<p>location you know who made it where they sent it</p>
<p>they have no value eiffel tower 001 is the most important</p>
<p>and so i think that&rsquo;s ultimately what we&rsquo;re starting to see here</p>
<p>and what we&rsquo;re looking at is probably one percent of what it&rsquo;s going to grow</p>
<p>into so you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re bullish you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>it could grow into something for one percent it could grow into something</p>
<p>significant like all the kinds of different applications</p>
<p>strip away all the applications right now and just think about</p>
<p>is digital scarcity going to be important on the internet moving all the things</p>
<p>that are scarce in the physical world into digital space</p>
<p>us trying to figure out which things can be moved and not</p>
<p>and also there&rsquo;s things in the digital space just like you&rsquo;re saying that</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t exist in the physical world that might also</p>
<p>benefit from gaining scarcity like you know people are i guess creating</p>
<p>nfts out of like tweets or whatever so like you&rsquo;re you have you</p>
<p>have a fun twitter account you know you could say like you</p>
<p>could put value to a single tweet and then be</p>
<p>able to invest in it and trade it and buy parts of it and all those kinds of</p>
<p>things you know you can invest in people you</p>
<p>can invest in you know art can be defined broadly as</p>
<p>any kind of creation right and in some sense</p>
<p>this whole idea of scarcity can overtake the entirety</p>
<p>of the digital world it can like consume the</p>
<p>all of the markets we see as financial markets and just turn</p>
<p>everything into a market well so if i take you on like a i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>10 year fast forward yeah and i paint a picture of uh something today that seems</p>
<p>absolutely insane but there&rsquo;s early signs that people are</p>
<p>building this and let&rsquo;s just give them the benefit of the doubt that</p>
<p>some of the early iterations will work and some of or most of them won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a world where you and i are participating in a digital economy</p>
<p>in a virtual world where uh whether it is a piece of art</p>
<p>it is a digital sculpture it is a digital</p>
<p>skin from a video game it is a digital good that we purchased somewhere online</p>
<p>and we bring it and we display it in a digital museum or a virtual museum</p>
<p>and so now all of a sudden you can charge people for entry</p>
<p>you can consign digital goods it&rsquo;s the replication of what happens in the</p>
<p>analog world now just in digital and when you do that</p>
<p>what you do is you take the addressable markets</p>
<p>of these assets or these mechanisms and they explode</p>
<p>in the digital realm and so now all of a sudden</p>
<p>how fast does the human race accelerate when it comes to human</p>
<p>production intelligence learning all in the digital</p>
<p>output it&rsquo;s just if i said to you 20 years ago i&rsquo;m going to give you a</p>
<p>global education that means i&rsquo;m going to take you and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to physically move you to geography after geography after</p>
<p>geography it&rsquo;s going to take time it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>take resources and ultimately it&rsquo;s going to take lots of effort</p>
<p>if i now said to you hey i&rsquo;m going to transport you</p>
<p>in this virtual world to multiple geographies</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re going to experience it in this virtual</p>
<p>world and you&rsquo;re going to have digital goods that you can take</p>
<p>from economy to economy or from location to location</p>
<p>all of a sudden you may get maybe you get 90 of the value you don&rsquo;t get 100</p>
<p>of the same value we get 90 of the value but you can</p>
<p>do it at a much faster pace and so in the six month period</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve actually made three times the progress</p>
<p>than you would have if you had to do in the physical world so that&rsquo;s where i</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;re heading so there&rsquo;s digital art being displayed</p>
<p>in the digital museum and people are being charged for access</p>
<p>and perhaps we plug in our senses which means we start to operate more and more</p>
<p>in a virtual reality augmented reality virtual reality way</p>
<p>with this digital world and increasingly going to this world</p>
<p>basically lived most of our productive and uh</p>
<p>social lives in this digital world uh and increasingly essentially create a</p>
<p>simulation where the biological basis is just there</p>
<p>to say sustain the brain that&rsquo;s used to operate in the in the virtual world</p>
<p>uh taking us back to the original when we started talking about war</p>
<p>i wonder what conflict looks like in that world</p>
<p>that uh the people who are born today maybe will be fighting wars</p>
<p>in the space in in that museum world in that digital world remember what i said</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re moving from a world of conflict surrounded</p>
<p>and determined by bombs bullets and soldiers</p>
<p>to a battlefield that is determined by war of information</p>
<p>and cyber capabilities and so in that virtual world</p>
<p>is it about death and destruction of human life in the physical analog world</p>
<p>or will it become more important to attack or defend</p>
<p>virtual property and virtual life and you know some level of virtual</p>
<p>sovereignty in my opinion the latter is more likely</p>
<p>and so what you start to understand is well</p>
<p>what do you truly value in your life is it the physical analog materialistic</p>
<p>consumptive goods or is it virtual</p>
<p>and in many cases something as simple as the ability to connect</p>
<p>with somebody it&rsquo;s really important and so one of the most disruptive</p>
<p>combative violent things that a country may do to another country in the future</p>
<p>simply take down the internet</p>
<p>and put people in isolation yeah i don&rsquo;t need to physically harm you if i can</p>
<p>psychologically harm you i don&rsquo;t need to it&rsquo;s terrifying yeah i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need to uh actually convince you</p>
<p>through a monopoly on violence on physical violence</p>
<p>what if i can psychologically change the way you see the world</p>
<p>through misinformation through all sorts of</p>
<p>nefarious activities and i think that you know the united states has been</p>
<p>struggling with this idea over the last couple of years in the political arena</p>
<p>but what happens when it starts to come to other aspects of our life</p>
<p>and i think it&rsquo;s very likely it&rsquo;s almost obviously likely that we&rsquo;re moving into</p>
<p>the digital world</p>
<p>the one of the features of the digital world</p>
<p>is that artificial intelligence systems can operate with much more power in a</p>
<p>in a frictionless way in that world currently as we understand it it&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to build robots that operate at scale and do like</p>
<p>arbitrary large amount of impact damage or positive</p>
<p>in the physical world it&rsquo;s much easier to do in the digital world</p>
<p>do you have do you ever think about ai systems</p>
<p>just swimming about uh doing extraordinarily powerful destructive</p>
<p>things in the digital world is that something of a concern to you</p>
<p>or is this something into a very distant future</p>
<p>i think a lot of artificial intelligence is</p>
<p>uh in the name it&rsquo;s simply the replication of human intelligence</p>
<p>at scale automated and program uh programmatic meaning</p>
<p>that in the analog world you could go hire a</p>
<p>thousand employees or in you know an amazon case hire</p>
<p>millions of employees and set a mission or a goal and push</p>
<p>them to go do that that requires recruiting retention</p>
<p>training resources all that stuff in the virtual world or in this digital</p>
<p>economy what if you can just program the resources</p>
<p>and gain the same leverage and do it at scale and do it in a very</p>
<p>programmatic way and then have them actually make decisions</p>
<p>in a way that doesn&rsquo;t require you to have thought of every single</p>
<p>potential scenario or edge case that&rsquo;s ultimately what we&rsquo;re talking about when</p>
<p>we talk about artificial intelligence right</p>
<p>and so when you look at that when technology is created</p>
<p>everyone uses it for good or bad but both get used</p>
<p>right and so whether we&rsquo;re talking about cell phones beepers the internet</p>
<p>uh guns whatever it&rsquo;s always used for good and bad</p>
<p>the big question is and i think that you know yourself and many other people have</p>
<p>rightfully said this is the question really becomes</p>
<p>is the negative and nefarious uses of this inadvertent potentially</p>
<p>or does it actually come from a malicious person it&rsquo;s the intention</p>
<p>malicious and to me that&rsquo;s what i i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>enough you know much more about this and there&rsquo;s plenty of other people who do as</p>
<p>well but i do think that there will be</p>
<p>nefarious actors and malicious people but we&rsquo;re going to treat them the same</p>
<p>way we&rsquo;ve always treated people who use technology poorly right we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>understand it we&rsquo;re going to identify it we&rsquo;re going to control it and then we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to end up reversing it or preventing that from doing them it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>inadvertent things that i think are actually the most dangerous</p>
<p>because when you have something that can think for itself</p>
<p>and there is no way to leverage a monopoly on violence</p>
<p>for control it&rsquo;s a very scary thing and it can i mean the the thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>scary to me is this it can scale arbitrarily so it can outnumber humans</p>
<p>very quickly even if it&rsquo;s dumber than humans and so</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;re able to reason about a world</p>
<p>like let&rsquo;s look at the physical analog where all of a sudden</p>
<p>uh let&rsquo;s talk about something kind of like humans but dumber than humans like</p>
<p>chimps okay imagine that all of a sudden chimps</p>
<p>could multiply arbitrarily quickly and you could have</p>
<p>like a trillion chimps the next day when you</p>
<p>when you only had maybe a million the day before</p>
<p>like how does that world look different where the fuck all these chimps come</p>
<p>from and they like and then we can we can</p>
<p>pretend to be like well let&rsquo;s hope the chimps like don&rsquo;t get violent because</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t seem to get violent when the resources aren&rsquo;t constrained</p>
<p>but like we don&rsquo;t know and the problem is</p>
<p>it all starts by building that first chip multiplier</p>
<p>device and everyone&rsquo;s like okay yeah there&rsquo;s a lot of good applications you</p>
<p>want you know uh you can make all kinds of</p>
<p>arguments for why you have more chimps maybe they can help you out around the</p>
<p>house or something like that in the physical space uh but</p>
<p>ultimately it&rsquo;s the unintended consequences that you&rsquo;re referring to is</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen i&rsquo;m really worried about</p>
<p>dumb ai agents uh like having impact when they&rsquo;re multiplied</p>
<p>to a million to a billion and are allowed to operate in the digital space</p>
<p>especially as we clearly are moving more and more</p>
<p>of our lives into the digital space so it&rsquo;s kind of terrifying because we you</p>
<p>know a lot of people are terrified or like concerned about super</p>
<p>intelligence systems i think i&rsquo;m definitely much more</p>
<p>concerned about super dumb systems at scale that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrifying i always think about um the inadvertent</p>
<p>but as you were talking what it made me think of is</p>
<p>also the irreversible irreversible that&rsquo;s right so it&rsquo;s one thing if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your inadvertent negative impact but we have</p>
<p>reversibility built into a system and we can fix our mistakes yeah i think</p>
<p>the really scary part is when you overlay inadvertent mistakes with the</p>
<p>irreversible aspect of it and therefore humans have no control</p>
<p>yeah if you if you have the trillion chimps you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not gonna like it when you try to start killing them off</p>
<p>uh all right but back to bitcoin those chimps in the bitcoin community</p>
<p>anytime you bring up chimps some people say joe rogan entered the chat</p>
<p>can i ask you about sort of learning about bitcoin books and resources you</p>
<p>have an amazing podcast that&rsquo;s not just about</p>
<p>bitcoin or cryptocurrency it&rsquo;s about everything including life but you do</p>
<p>have a lot of really amazing conversations about this whole</p>
<p>digital world but you obviously you also have a newsletter</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s incredible on substack and and um</p>
<p>but do you have recommendations maybe it would be great if you could talk about</p>
<p>first of all your podcast and the newsletter but also other</p>
<p>resources that you recommend people should check out in order to learn</p>
<p>about bitcoin yeah so the podcast and uh email are like the two most selfish</p>
<p>things i do because the podcast is a way for me to</p>
<p>learn from other people so i get them to come on and tell me all</p>
<p>the things they&rsquo;re thinking about and i could ask some questions what&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>called by the way uh just the pomp podcast</p>
<p>and so in doing that um it really is informative for me and i think that my</p>
<p>whole goal is just like if i&rsquo;m learning other people will be learning</p>
<p>and then the email uh i read it every morning because it forces me to</p>
<p>collect my thoughts and actually articulate them in somewhat of a</p>
<p>coherent way and so it&rsquo;s just something that um is</p>
<p>like a practice that i probably would do even if no one read it</p>
<p>and then by being able to publish it uh what does it do it elicits you know</p>
<p>both the good and bad responses and so people will let me know if they think</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m an idiot and they&rsquo;ll usually not respond if they think that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something smart and so um those two things are really um</p>
<p>educational for me and i think kind of forced me to uh to be able to</p>
<p>articulate a lot of ideas but a lot of what i share or learn on</p>
<p>those things come from these other resources</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m definitely subscribing people should subscribe but</p>
<p>what are bitcoin resources books that you recommend</p>
<p>i think you got to start with bitcoin standard uh that one to me feels like</p>
<p>uh it really lays out the picture nicely um</p>
<p>there is uh bitcoin uh money you can&rsquo;t fuck with</p>
<p>i was written by our friend jason williams uh as you can imagine it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically what it talks about uh there&rsquo;s another book layered money</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s written by nick who uh who&rsquo;s done a great uh great job</p>
<p>kind of laying it out um there&rsquo;s a book uh called bitcoin in black america</p>
<p>written by a guy isaiah jackson and he basically lays out the argument for</p>
<p>why the black community um can benefit in a</p>
<p>asymmetric way from something like bitcoin um and there&rsquo;s a whole bunch</p>
<p>more i&rsquo;m gonna forget them all um there&rsquo;s the uh i think it&rsquo;s called the</p>
<p>cost of tomorrow a guy jeff booth uh jeff booth wrote it</p>
<p>um and just if you get on twitter basically you&rsquo;re gonna see all these</p>
<p>books flying around um but i do have to say that uh from a</p>
<p>psychological concept uh or philosophical</p>
<p>concept the number one book that i&rsquo;ve ever read uh that aligns with bitcoin</p>
<p>ethos but doesn&rsquo;t say a word about bitcoin</p>
<p>is a book called the dow of capital by mark spitznagel</p>
<p>and so what he essentially does is he just reiterates over and over and over</p>
<p>again long term thinking outliers disruption</p>
<p>all the stuff and so he&rsquo;s a guy who he runs a fund</p>
<p>uh that essentially they just do uh tail risk hedging</p>
<p>and so in you know march or february of 2020</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re up like four thousand percent right</p>
<p>by the way they pretty much lose money you know</p>
<p>for eight nine years then that happens and so</p>
<p>uh but they&rsquo;re still one of the best performing funds if you look at it over</p>
<p>you know years and years and so it&rsquo;s just this mindset of</p>
<p>uh everyone is so short term focused and so i think it&rsquo;s just a great reminder</p>
<p>to long term thinking uh and also i mean i&rsquo;ve gotten quite a</p>
<p>bit of value just reading the papers and that&rsquo;s perhaps more</p>
<p>like for technical folks there&rsquo;s quite an active research community</p>
<p>and also going back to the original white paper and just</p>
<p>original documents old school old school is still</p>
<p>what uh like what a few years ago still really interesting</p>
<p>to think about to look at what people were thinking about</p>
<p>because the the principles are carried through</p>
<p>with uh other cryptocurrencies as well like it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all there even in the early documents so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of fascinating to see that whole history from if you&rsquo;re more</p>
<p>like tech savvy and like you said twitter is actually an interesting place</p>
<p>if you can look past all the shit coin talk</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a fascinating place for news and resources</p>
<p>is there books outside of all this cryptocurrency sort of</p>
<p>technical fiction philosophical that impact on your life</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve you have interests that are all over the place is there</p>
<p>something that um you would recommend to others so</p>
<p>doubt capital is definitely probably my favorite book</p>
<p>um books that have been impactful i read uh when i was 20 actually sitting in the</p>
<p>desert of iraq um rich dad poor dad thinking grow rich</p>
<p>and the richest man in babble on and i don&rsquo;t think i took a single thing</p>
<p>and like implemented it from like an execution</p>
<p>standpoint uh but it was a complete shift in mentality</p>
<p>and understanding a relationship with money and um</p>
<p>just kind of what i wanted to do with my life and stuff like that so i think</p>
<p>those three books i read them in succession</p>
<p>were really impactful um and then i think one of the best books probably</p>
<p>ever written is uh i think it&rsquo;s called uh when breath becomes air</p>
<p>um or air becomes breath i can&rsquo;t remember uh but it&rsquo;s basically a</p>
<p>doctor or a medical professional who&rsquo;s dying</p>
<p>and he essentially writes about the experience and thoughts and kind of all</p>
<p>the stuff and i think that it&rsquo;s just uh one of these</p>
<p>things where if you said to me you know what&rsquo;s the number one thing i took out</p>
<p>of my experience in iraq that&rsquo;s a book like that also gives you is</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all gonna die right and you and i can want to be as</p>
<p>immortal as we want but at some point we&rsquo;re gonna die</p>
<p>and so it really does kind of focus you on</p>
<p>time being that scarce asset and use it for</p>
<p>enjoyment and happiness uh more so than anything else and i think that&rsquo;s part of</p>
<p>your message and it&rsquo;s a great one do you think do you like literally</p>
<p>meditate on your own mortality i necessarily think i uh meditate on it</p>
<p>as much as um are you afraid of death were you afraid of</p>
<p>death when you&rsquo;re in iraq i mean if you&rsquo;re coming face to face with it</p>
<p>are you afraid of death today no i i think that it was just one of these</p>
<p>things where like if you fixate on something and you</p>
<p>worry about it then at least to me like you become</p>
<p>uneasy about it and so after an experience like going to war</p>
<p>i think that everything is just so not important compared to that</p>
<p>right like when i came back i remember uh going back into</p>
<p>the college environment and like things people worried about i was like</p>
<p>listen let me explain to you you know what the real world is like right</p>
<p>but i think even today right if you talk to people who know me really well</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t get worked up about a lot of stuff i don&rsquo;t get you know in either</p>
<p>direction good or bad uh anything because ultimately it just</p>
<p>comes down to if that&rsquo;s the final result</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s enjoy it it&rsquo;s fascinating to ask you</p>
<p>because this reformulation of money essentially buying time</p>
<p>and uh you know there&rsquo;s the old question of does money buy happiness</p>
<p>do you think money can buy happiness in the context of money being able to buy</p>
<p>time or is happiness something else that is</p>
<p>beyond all of this when people talk about this question i</p>
<p>think that they really focus on money as a means to getting materialistic</p>
<p>things so they want a big house they want a boat they want a fast car they</p>
<p>want you know whatever they think that&rsquo;s the stuff that will</p>
<p>make them happy what i think about it is if you have</p>
<p>resources you can have time and if you have time and</p>
<p>you spend it the way that you want to spend it then that&rsquo;s ultimately</p>
<p>happiness so i always say to people if you think that money doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>buy you happiness what if i told you that if you had more money you could</p>
<p>spend more time with your family it reframes it yeah and now is all</p>
<p>about i want to do certain things in life but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people who spend their life</p>
<p>not doing those things because they feel the need to pursue economic</p>
<p>means as a way to provide a living or</p>
<p>whatever and so i explain this listen in my opinion again it&rsquo;s my opinion it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what makes me happy if i can leverage financial resources to</p>
<p>create more time to do the things i like i&rsquo;m happier</p>
<p>might not work for everybody but like that&rsquo;s what works for me and so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this element of like i don&rsquo;t care what other people think if</p>
<p>they like that or not because they&rsquo;re not me right like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>almost this element of like you gotta figure out what works for you and if it</p>
<p>works for me then like no i think that resonate that that will</p>
<p>resonate with a lot of people i think that&rsquo;s a brilliant reframing of it</p>
<p>uh that said uh you kind of imply there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a reason behind this whole existence of ours there&rsquo;s a meaning to it</p>
<p>so let me ask what is the meaning of life</p>
<p>anthony do you think about these ridiculous big questions</p>
<p>that have no answer every once in a while or do you just enjoy the shit out</p>
<p>of every day i answer it in a way that um isn&rsquo;t meant</p>
<p>to be accurate it&rsquo;s meant to um</p>
<p>be the right answer for me which is ultimately you know and i talk to a lot</p>
<p>of people who always ask like what&rsquo;s the what are you doing why are you doing this</p>
<p>i say it&rsquo;s to be happy and the reason why i think of it that</p>
<p>way is i&rsquo;ve got a friend jonathan galler who talks about uh</p>
<p>you know enough being enough and recently he talked about it in the</p>
<p>um context of bitcoin and so bitcoiners are have two things any</p>
<p>bitcoiner if you talk to them they believe the same two things one</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want the us dollar price to go up because they actually want to</p>
<p>acquire more bitcoin right and then let it go once they feel like they&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>enough but two is no matter how much they own they think that they don&rsquo;t own</p>
<p>enough and they want to acquire more and so at some point you say to yourself</p>
<p>what is enough and and i think that the whole meaning of life</p>
<p>is to understand kind of what your level of satisfaction is and for</p>
<p>some people that&rsquo;s a monetary thing some people that&rsquo;s a freedom of time thing</p>
<p>for some people it&rsquo;s an impact thing whatever but just</p>
<p>understanding that&rsquo;s important and then going and accomplishing it</p>
<p>and what i&rsquo;ve found is that the people who i know who have done this and been</p>
<p>intentional about it they accomplish it on a much shorter</p>
<p>timeline than people who don&rsquo;t right there&rsquo;s some people who start thinking</p>
<p>about this when they&rsquo;re 60 naturally you&rsquo;re not going to accomplish</p>
<p>before you&rsquo;re 60 if you just start thinking about it 60</p>
<p>people who are thinking about it earlier can do it and so i think that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>it for me it&rsquo;s just like the meaning of life is to enjoy it</p>
<p>the way i think about it that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s a really nice formulation i i</p>
<p>almost like to sort of oscillate back and forth so</p>
<p>majority of the time is spent at the moment of enough is enough</p>
<p>of gratitude of basically being content with where you&rsquo;re at like deeply</p>
<p>appreciative of every moment and all the bitcoin whatever bitcoin you</p>
<p>have being deeply appreciative of it and that being enough and then some</p>
<p>fraction of time perhaps it shrinks as you get older that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s an optimal trajectory there but</p>
<p>some fraction of time is spent being yeah like deeply self critical</p>
<p>and nothing is enough nothing you&rsquo;ve ever done is worth anything it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>marvin minsky said like the secret to success</p>
<p>is hating everything you&rsquo;ve ever done so like that mode of just hating</p>
<p>everything you&rsquo;ve ever done and just like trying to improve trying to make</p>
<p>stuff better nothing is enough it&rsquo;s never enough that</p>
<p>kind of stuff and then oscillating back and forth like</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to have the same algorithm operating throughout the day</p>
<p>you could just like oscillate back and forth</p>
<p>and maybe reserve that gratitude part the chill part to when you&rsquo;re hanging</p>
<p>out with family and friends and loved ones</p>
<p>and then when you&rsquo;re like alone or maybe at work</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the madman comes out kind of thing i also think it&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>kind of purpose driven in the sense of there&rsquo;s a lot of people who have the</p>
<p>uh i need to do more but in a somewhat altruistic way</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re you know take elon as an example</p>
<p>the idea of colonizing mars sure if he is successful he will be very</p>
<p>rich i don&rsquo;t think you or i or many people</p>
<p>believe he&rsquo;s doing it for the money right there&rsquo;s a lot of other things he</p>
<p>could do that would be much easier that would make him tons of money</p>
<p>and so in some weird way he has enough because he&rsquo;s able to free himself from</p>
<p>the constraints of i need to acquire more resources</p>
<p>and he can focus on what is the thing that i want to work on regardless of</p>
<p>money and so in that pursuit that is</p>
<p>non economic you can be as selfish as you want</p>
<p>because ultimately you&rsquo;re not tied back to</p>
<p>this like measurement tool and so it&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>uh again like altruistic non monetary purpose and i think that there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of people who spend their whole life looking for that and they don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what it is and so again some people may not think</p>
