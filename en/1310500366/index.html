    <p>The following is a conversation with Jeannie Vermetti,</p>
<p>who was a longtime CEO, president, and chairman of IBM.</p>
<p>And for many years, she was widely considered</p>
<p>to be one of the most powerful women in the world.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s the author of a new book on power, leadership,</p>
<p>and her life story called Good Power,</p>
<p>coming out on March 7th.</p>
<p>She is an incredible leader and human being,</p>
<p>both fearless and compassionate.</p>
<p>It was a huge honor and pleasure for me</p>
<p>to sit down and have this chat with her.</p>
<p>And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We got Athletic Greens for health,</p>
<p>ExpressVPN for privacy and security,</p>
<p>and InsideTracker for biological monitoring.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>Also, if you want to work with our team,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re always hiring.</p>
<p>Go to lexfriedman.com slash hiring.</p>
<p>And now, onto the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make this interesting,</p>
<p>but if you skip them, please still check our sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe you will too.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the AG1 Drink, which is an all-in-one daily drink</p>
<p>to support better health and peak performance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve drank it twice today already.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s delicious, and it&rsquo;s a refreshing start</p>
<p>for usually the second work session of the day.</p>
<p>I start the day with a cup of coffee</p>
<p>and just deep, deep, deep focus</p>
<p>on the hardest task of the day.</p>
<p>And then I break the fast with Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>either with a workout before</p>
<p>or if I&rsquo;m not working out that day,</p>
<p>just with a kind of mental break.</p>
<p>A friend of mine has recently been pushing me to meditate,</p>
<p>and so I&rsquo;ve been taking that midday point</p>
<p>as a kind of another opportunity to return</p>
<p>to what I usually do in the morning,</p>
<p>which is repeat the mantra for the day.</p>
<p>But I do it less mantra-like</p>
<p>and more just calming my mind</p>
<p>and thinking about all the things I&rsquo;m grateful for,</p>
<p>really focusing on the gratitude part.</p>
<p>Anyway, so that&rsquo;s associated with Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>and also later on in the day,</p>
<p>usually I&rsquo;ll take another Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll do the same when I&rsquo;m traveling.</p>
<p>I got the travel packs,</p>
<p>and I got, I guess, the non-travel pack version at home.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you one month&rsquo;s supply of fish oil</p>
<p>when you sign up at athleticgreens.com slash lex.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by ExpressVPN.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used them for many years</p>
<p>to protect my privacy on the internet.</p>
<p>It actually takes me back</p>
<p>to the early days of the internet for me,</p>
<p>my own personal experience,</p>
<p>and it was shadier and darker and more dangerous,</p>
<p>but also more exciting,</p>
<p>and it was unclear what the internet was going to become.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s that hacker, I guess, ethic.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a kind of deep sense of freedom.</p>
<p>Before big companies came in</p>
<p>and tried to figure out how to make a lot of money,</p>
<p>and really through that process of capitalism,</p>
<p>able to get kind of control,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m actually very, very happy</p>
<p>to a degree that internet has maintained its freedom,</p>
<p>but still I think some of the initial days</p>
<p>of the real kind of almost anarchic freedom</p>
<p>has dissipated somewhat.</p>
<p>I think about that sometimes,</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s what a VPN represents to me,</p>
<p>is a kind of statement of freedom,</p>
<p>of protecting your identity,</p>
<p>of respecting your privacy.</p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s a powerful statement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an important one to remember,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s one I&rsquo;ll probably return to time and time again.</p>
<p>Anyway, go to expressvpn.com slash LexPod</p>
<p>for an extra three months free.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by InsideTracker,</p>
<p>a service I use to track biological data.</p>
<p>They take a blood test from you,</p>
<p>and that blood test gives you a bunch of information</p>
<p>about your body,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s all kinds of information you can get</p>
<p>from blood data, DNA data, fitness tracker data,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>and basically analyze what can be optimized about your body.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of interesting approaches</p>
<p>to the way you optimize your body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to have that data,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s important to make the right decisions</p>
<p>based on that data, but not over-obsess about the data,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a really nice balance.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re just completely blind</p>
<p>and just kinda hope everything&rsquo;s gonna turn out okay</p>
<p>until you end up in a hospital, that&rsquo;s not the way to go.</p>
<p>So the balance there for me is</p>
<p>you should be taking blood tests like with InsideTracker</p>
<p>and getting information about your body</p>
<p>that you can get from that data,</p>
<p>and then make decisions based on that, and then that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Pick the low-hanging fruit of that fruit tree</p>
<p>that represents the problems of life.</p>
<p>I guess what that horrible metaphor means</p>
<p>is that you should fix the easy problems,</p>
<p>and that means the things that are obviously wrong</p>
<p>based on the data you collect from your blood.</p>
<p>Okay, get special savings for a limited time</p>
<p>when you go to InsideTracker.com slash Lex.</p>

<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Jeanne Rometty.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>You worked at IBM for over 40 years,</p>
<p>starting as a systems engineer,</p>
<p>and you ran the company as chairman, president,</p>
<p>and CEO from 2011 to 2020.</p>
<p>IBM is one of the largest tech companies in the world,</p>
<p>maybe you can correct me on this,</p>
<p>with about 280,000 employees.</p>
<p>What are the biggest challenges</p>
<p>running the company of that size?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a sort of big overview question.</p>
<p>The biggest challenges I think are not in running them,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in changing them.</p>
<p>And that idea to know what you should change</p>
<p>and what you should not change.</p>
<p>Actually, people don&rsquo;t always ask that question.</p>
<p>What should endure, even if it has to be modernized,</p>
<p>but what should endure?</p>
<p>And then I found the hardest part</p>
<p>was changing how work got done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a big company.</p>
<p>What was the parts that you thought should endure?</p>
<p>The core of the company that was beautiful and powerful</p>
<p>and could persist through time,</p>
<p>that should persist through time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be interested, do you have a perception</p>
<p>of what you think it would be?</p>
<p>Do I have a perception?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m a romantic for a history of long-running companies</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s kind of a tradition as a AI person.</p>
<p>To me, IBM has some epic sort of research accomplishments</p>
<p>where you show off Deep Blue and Watson,</p>
<p>just impressive big moonshot challenges</p>
<p>and accomplishing those.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s, I think, probably a small part of what IBM is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s mostly like the sexy public-facing part.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, certainly the research part itself</p>
<p>is over 3,000, so it&rsquo;s not that small.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty big research group.</p>
<p>But the part that should endure ends up being</p>
<p>a company that does things that are essential to the world,</p>
<p>meaning, think back, you said you&rsquo;re a romantic.</p>
<p>It was the 30s, the social security system.</p>
<p>It was putting the man on the moon.</p>
<p>It was, to this day, banks don&rsquo;t run, railroads don&rsquo;t run.</p>
<p>That is at its core, it&rsquo;s doing mission-critical work.</p>
<p>And so that part, I think, is at its core,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a business-to-business company.</p>
<p>And at its core, it&rsquo;s about doing things</p>
<p>that are really important to the world</p>
<p>becoming running and being better.</p>
<p>Running the infrastructure of the world,</p>
<p>so doing it at scale, doing it reliably.</p>
<p>Yes, secure in this world, that&rsquo;s like everything.</p>
<p>And in fact, when I started,</p>
<p>I almost felt people were looking for what that was.</p>
<p>And together, we sort of, in a word, was to be essential.</p>
<p>And the reason I loved that word was,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t call myself essential.</p>
<p>You have to determine I am, right?</p>
<p>So it was to be essential.</p>
<p>Even though some of what we did</p>
<p>is exactly what you said, it&rsquo;s below the surface.</p>
<p>So many people, because people say to me,</p>
<p>well, what does IBM do now, right?</p>
<p>And over the years, it&rsquo;s changed so much.</p>
<p>And today, it&rsquo;s really a software and consulting company.</p>
<p>Consulting is a third of it.</p>
<p>And the software is all hybrid cloud and AI.</p>
<p>That would not have been true, as you well know,</p>
<p>back even two decades ago, right?</p>
<p>So it changes.</p>
<p>But I think at its core, it&rsquo;s that be essential.</p>
<p>You said moonshot, can&rsquo;t all be moonshots,</p>
<p>because moonshots don&rsquo;t always work.</p>
<p>But mission-critical work.</p>
<p>So given the size, though, when you started running it,</p>
<p>did you feel the sort of thing</p>
<p>that people usually associate with size,</p>
<p>which is bureaucracy, and maybe the aspect of size</p>
<p>that hinder progress or hinder pivoting,</p>
<p>did you feel that?</p>
<p>You would, for lots of reasons.</p>
<p>I think when you&rsquo;re a big company,</p>
<p>sometimes people think of process as the client themselves,</p>
<p>you know, I always say to people,</p>
<p>your process is not your customer.</p>
<p>There is a real customer here that you exist for.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really easy to fall into,</p>
<p>because people are a master to this process.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not right.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re big, the other thing,</p>
<p>boy, there&rsquo;s a premium on it, is speed, right?</p>
<p>That in our industry, you gotta be fast.</p>
<p>And go back, like when I took over, and it was 2012,</p>
<p>you know, we had a lot of catching up to do</p>
<p>and a lot of things to do, and it was moving so fast.</p>
<p>And as you well know,</p>
<p>all those trends were happening at once,</p>
<p>which made them go even faster.</p>
<p>And so pretty unprecedented, actually,</p>
<p>for that many trends to be at one time.</p>
<p>And I used to say to people,</p>
<p>go faster, go faster, go faster.</p>
<p>And honestly, I&rsquo;ve tired them out.</p>
<p>I mean, it kind of dawned on me that when you&rsquo;re that big,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really valuable lesson.</p>
<p>And it taught me like the hows,</p>
<p>perhaps more important than the what.</p>
<p>Because if I didn&rsquo;t do something</p>
<p>to change how work was done,</p>
<p>like change those processes or give them new tools,</p>
<p>help them with skills, they couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just like, do the same thing faster.</p>
<p>If someone tells you, you know, you&rsquo;ve got hiking boots,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, no, go run a marathon.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, I can&rsquo;t do it in those boots.</p>
<p>But so you&rsquo;ve gotta do something.</p>
<p>And at first, I think the ways for big companies,</p>
<p>I would call them like blunt clubs.</p>
<p>You do what everyone does.</p>
<p>You reduce layers.</p>
<p>Because if you reduce layers, decisions go faster.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s math.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s less decision points, things go faster.</p>
<p>You do the blunt club thing.</p>
<p>And then after that, though,</p>
<p>it did lead me down a long journey</p>
<p>of they sound like buzzwords,</p>
<p>but if you really do them at scale, they&rsquo;re hard,</p>
<p>around things like agile.</p>
<p>And because you&rsquo;ve really gotta change</p>
<p>the way work gets done.</p>
<p>And we ended up training, God,</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands of people on that stuff</p>
<p>to really change it.</p>
<p>On how to do it correctly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, versus,</p>
<p>because everybody talks about it.</p>
<p>But the idea that you would really have</p>
<p>small multidisciplinary teams work from the outside in,</p>
<p>set those sort of interim steps,</p>
<p>you know, take the feedback pivot,</p>
<p>and then do it on not just products,</p>
<p>do it on lots of things,</p>
<p>was, it&rsquo;s hard to do at scale.</p>
<p>People always say, oh, I got this agile group over here,</p>
<p>40 people.</p>
<p>But not when you&rsquo;re a couple hundred thousand people.</p>
<p>You gotta get a lot of people to work that way.</p>
<p>The blonde club thing you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>So flatten the organization as much as possible.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I probably reduced</p>
<p>the layers of management by half.</p>
<p>And so, that has lots of benefits, right?</p>
<p>Time to a decision.</p>
<p>More autonomy to people.</p>
<p>And then the idea of like faster clarity</p>
<p>of where you&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re not just filtered</p>
<p>through so many different layers.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s the kind of thing a lot of companies,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re big, have to just keep going through.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like grass grows, you know?</p>
<p>It just comes back.</p>
<p>And you gotta go back town and work on it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a natural thing.</p>
<p>But I hear so many people talk about it, Lex,</p>
<p>this idea of like, okay, who makes a decision?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve often heard nobody can say yes</p>
<p>and everybody can say no.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually what you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to get out of a system like that.</p>
<p>So, I mean, your book in general,</p>
<p>the way you lead is very much about we and us,</p>
<p>you know, the power of we.</p>
<p>But is there times when a leader has to step in</p>
<p>and be almost autocratic, take control</p>
<p>and make hard, unpopular decisions?</p>
<p>Oh, I am sure you know the answer to that.</p>
<p>And it is, of course, yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just fun to hear you say it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun to say it, yeah.</p>
<p>You know, because I actually,</p>
<p>A, there&rsquo;s a leader for a time,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s a leader for a situation, right?</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve had to do plenty of unpopular things.</p>
<p>I think anytime you have to run a company</p>
<p>that endures a century and has to endure another century,</p>
<p>you will do unpopular things.</p>
<p>You have no choice.</p>
<p>And I often felt I had to sacrifice things</p>
<p>for the long term.</p>
<p>And whether that would have been, you know,</p>
<p>really difficult things like, you know,</p>
<p>job changes or reductions,</p>
<p>or whether it would be things like,</p>
<p>hey, you know, we&rsquo;re gonna change</p>
<p>the way we do our semiconductors,</p>
<p>and a whole different philosophy.</p>
<p>You have no choice.</p>
<p>I mean, and in times of crisis as well,</p>
<p>you gotta be, I always said it&rsquo;s not a popularity contest.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, none of these jobs are popularity contests.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if your company&rsquo;s got one person</p>
<p>or half a million.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not popularity contests.</p>
<p>But psychologically, is it difficult</p>
<p>to just sort of step in as a new CEO and,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re fighting against tradition</p>
<p>and against all these people</p>
<p>that act like experts of their thing,</p>
<p>and they are experts of their thing,</p>
<p>to step in and say, we have to do it differently.</p>
<p>When you gotta change a company,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really tempting to say, throw everything else out,</p>
<p>back to that what must endure, right?</p>
<p>But I know when I took over to start,</p>
<p>I knew how much had to change.</p>
<p>The more I got into it, I could see, wow,</p>
<p>a lot more had to change, right?</p>
<p>Because we needed a platform.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d always done our best when we had a platform,</p>
<p>a technology platform.</p>
<p>You will go back in time</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll think of the mainframe systems.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll think of the PC.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll think of perhaps middleware.</p>
<p>You could even call services a platform.</p>
<p>We needed a platform, the next platform here to be there.</p>
<p>Skills, when I took over, if I,</p>
<p>we inventoried who had modern skills for the future,</p>
<p>it was two out of 10 people.</p>
<p>Not that they didn&rsquo;t have relevant skills today,</p>
<p>but for the future, two out of 10, yikes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big problem, right?</p>
<p>The speed at which things were getting done,</p>
<p>that has to, so you got so much to do.</p>
<p>And you say, is that a scary thing?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Do you have to sometimes dictate?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But I did find, and it is worth it.</p>
<p>I know every big company I know,</p>
<p>my good friend that runs General Motors,</p>
<p>as she&rsquo;s had to change, go back to what is them, them.</p>
<p>And when you do that, that back to be essential,</p>
<p>we kind of started with, hey, it&rsquo;s be essential.</p>
<p>Then the next thing I did with the team was say,</p>
<p>okay, now this means new era of computing,</p>
<p>new buyers are out there,</p>
<p>and hey, we better have new skills.</p>
<p>Okay, now the next thing, how do you operationalize it?</p>
<p>And it just takes some time,</p>
<p>but you can engineer that and get people to build belief.</p>
<p>And for the skills, that means hiring,</p>
<p>and it means training?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Oh boy, that&rsquo;s a long,</p>
<p>skills is a really long topic in and of itself.</p>
<p>I try to put my view in it.</p>
<p>I learned a lot, and I changed my view on this a lot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go back at my very beginning, say 40 years ago.</p>
<p>I would have said at that point,</p>
<p>okay, I was always in a hurry.</p>
<p>I was interviewing to hire people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how you hire people.</p>
<p>40 years ago, I&rsquo;d be like,</p>
<p>okay, I gotta fit in these interviews.</p>
<p>I gotta hire someone to get this done.</p>
<p>Okay, then time would go on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh, that&rsquo;s not very good.</p>
<p>In fact, someone once said to me,</p>
<p>hey, hire the best people to work for you,</p>
<p>and your job gets a lot easier.</p>
<p>Okay, I should spend more time on this topic,</p>
<p>spend more time on it.</p>
<p>Then it was like, okay, hire experts, okay?</p>
<p>Okay, hired a lot of experts over my life.</p>
<p>And then I was really like an epiphany,</p>
<p>and it really happened over my tenure</p>
<p>running the company and having to change skills.</p>
<p>If someone&rsquo;s an expert at something</p>
<p>and has just done that for 30 years,</p>
<p>the odds of them really wanting to change a lot</p>
<p>are pretty low.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re in a really dynamic industry,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>And so, okay, that was kind of my first revelation on this.</p>
<p>And then when I looked to hiring,</p>
<p>I can remember when I started my job,</p>
<p>and we needed cyber people.</p>
<p>And I go out there and I look.</p>
<p>Unemployment in the US was almost 10%.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t find them.</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s 10%, and I can&rsquo;t find the people.</p>
<p>Okay, what&rsquo;s the issue?</p>
<p>Okay, they&rsquo;re not teaching the right things.</p>
<p>That led me down a path, and it was serendipity</p>
<p>that I happened to do a review</p>
<p>of corporate social responsibility.</p>
<p>We had this one little fledgling school</p>
<p>in a low-income area, and high school,</p>
<p>with a community college, we gave them internships,</p>
<p>direction on curriculum.</p>
<p>Lo and behold, we could hire these kids.</p>
<p>I said, hmm, this is not CSR.</p>
<p>I just found a new talent pool,</p>
<p>which takes me to now what I&rsquo;m doing in my post-retirement.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, this idea that don&rsquo;t hire</p>
<p>just for a college degree,</p>
<p>we had 99% of our hires were college and PhDs,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m all for it, so you&rsquo;re very, don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m deeply offended.</p>
<p>No, you should not be, and I&rsquo;m vice chair at Northwestern,</p>
<p>one of the vice chairs, but I said,</p>
<p>I just really like aptitude does not equal access.</p>
<p>These people didn&rsquo;t have access, but they had aptitude.</p>
<p>It changed my whole view to skills first.</p>
<p>And so now for hiring, that&rsquo;s kind of a long story</p>
<p>to tell you, the number one thing I would hire for now</p>
<p>is somebody&rsquo;s willingness to learn.</p>
<p>You know, and you can test, you can try different ways,</p>
<p>but their curiosity and willingness to learn,</p>
<p>hands down, I will take that trait</p>
<p>over anything else they have.</p>
<p>So the interview process, the questions you ask.</p>
<p>Changed, everything changed.</p>
<p>The kind of things you talk to them about</p>
<p>is try to get at how curious they are about the work.</p>
<p>And you can do testing, and I mean,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s what we triangulated around it lots of ways.</p>
<p>And now look, at the heart of it,</p>
<p>what it would do is change.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think of buying skills,</p>
<p>you think of building skills.</p>
<p>And when you think that way, with so many people,</p>
<p>and I think this country, many developed countries</p>
<p>being disenfranchised, you gotta bring them back</p>
<p>into the workforce somehow.</p>
<p>And they gotta get some kind of contemporary skills.</p>
<p>And if you took that approach,</p>
<p>you can bring them back into the workforce.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think some interesting combination</p>
<p>of humility and passion.</p>
<p>Because like you said, experts sometimes lack humility</p>
<p>if they call themselves an expert for a few too many years.</p>
<p>So you have to have that beginner&rsquo;s mind</p>
<p>and a passion to be able to aggressively constantly</p>
<p>be a beginner at everything and learn and learn and learn.</p>
<p>You know, I saw it firsthand</p>
<p>when we were beginning this path down the cloud in AI,</p>
<p>and people would say, oh, IBM, it&rsquo;s existential,</p>
<p>they gotta change, and all these things.</p>
<p>And I did hire a lot of people from outside,</p>
<p>very willing to learn new things.</p>
<p>Come on in, come on in.</p>
<p>And I sometimes say, shiny objects,</p>
<p>trained in shiny objects, come on in.</p>
<p>But I saw something, it was another one of these,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not a shiny object, I&rsquo;m not saying that.</p>
<p>But I learned something.</p>
<p>Okay, some of them did fantastic.</p>
<p>And others, they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>well, let me school you on everything.</p>
<p>But they didn&rsquo;t realize like we did</p>
<p>really mission critical work, and they&rsquo;d break a bank.</p>
<p>I mean, they would not understand</p>
<p>the certain kind of security and the auditability</p>
<p>and everything they had to go on.</p>
<p>And then I watched IBM people say,</p>
<p>oh, I actually could learn something.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, I don&rsquo;t know how to do,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really good thing I could learn.</p>
<p>And in the end, there was not like one group</p>
<p>was a winner and one was a loser.</p>
<p>The winners were the people who were willing</p>
<p>to learn from each other.</p>
<p>I mean, to me, it was very stark example of that point.</p>
<p>And I saw it firsthand.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so committed to this idea</p>
<p>about skills first.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how people should be hired,</p>
<p>promoted, paid, you name it.</p>
<p>Yeah, the AI in general,</p>
<p>it seems like nobody really understands now</p>
<p>what the future will look like.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all trying to figure it out.</p>
<p>So like what IBM will look like in 50 years</p>
<p>in relation to the software business to AI is unknown.</p>
<p>What Google will look like, what all these companies,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to figure it out.</p>
<p>And that means constantly learning,</p>
<p>taking risks, all of those things.</p>
<p>And nobody&rsquo;s really skilled in AI.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, because you have to keep up all the time, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely right, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t agree more with you on that.</p>
<p>You wrote in the book, so speaking of hiring,</p>
<p>quote, my drive for perfection often meant</p>
<p>I only focused on what needed to change</p>
<p>without acknowledging the positive.</p>
<p>This could keep people from trusting themselves.</p>
<p>It could take me a while to learn</p>
<p>that just because I could point something out</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t mean I should.</p>
<p>I still spotted errors, but I became more deliberate</p>
<p>about what I mentioned and sent back to get fixed.</p>
<p>I also tried to curtail my tendency to micromanage</p>
<p>and let people execute.</p>
<p>I had to stop assuming my way was the best or only way.</p>
<p>I was learning that giving other people control</p>
<p>builds their confidence and that constantly trying</p>
<p>to control people destroys it.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the right balance between showing the way</p>
<p>and helping people find the way?</p>
<p>That is a good question,</p>
<p>because like a really flip answer would be</p>
<p>as it gets bigger, you have no choice,</p>
<p>but to just, you can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>You have to tell or show, I mean,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to let people find their way</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so big, you can&rsquo;t, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an obvious answer.</p>
<p>Scope of work, bigger it gets,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;ve got to let more stuff go.</p>
<p>But I have always believed</p>
<p>that a leader&rsquo;s job is to do as well.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s like a few areas</p>
<p>that are really important that you always do.</p>
<p>Now it doesn&rsquo;t, meaning you&rsquo;re showing.</p>
<p>So like when it has to do with values</p>
<p>and value-based decisions,</p>
<p>like I think it&rsquo;s really important to constantly</p>
<p>show people that you walk your talk</p>
<p>on that kind of thing is super important.</p>
<p>And I actually think it&rsquo;s a struggle young companies have</p>
<p>because those values aren&rsquo;t deeply rooted.</p>
<p>And when a storm comes, it&rsquo;s easy to uproot.</p>
<p>And so I always felt like when it was that time,</p>
<p>I showed it.</p>
<p>I got taught that so young at IBM and even General Motors</p>
<p>that, in fact, I do write about that in the book.</p>
<p>First time I was a manager,</p>
<p>I had a gentleman telling dirty jokes</p>
<p>and not to me, but to other people.</p>
<p>And it really offended people and some of the women.</p>
<p>And this is the very early 80s.</p>
<p>And they came, said something.</p>
<p>I talked to my boss.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a first time manager.</p>
<p>And he was unequivocal with what I should do.</p>
<p>He said, and this was a top performer.</p>
<p>It stops immediately or you fire him.</p>
<p>So there are a few areas like that,</p>
<p>that I actually think you have to always continue</p>
<p>to role model and show, right?</p>
<p>That to me, isn&rsquo;t the kind that like</p>
<p>when do you let go of stuff, right?</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>The values and relationships with clients.</p>
<p>Yeah, whatever you&rsquo;re in service of.</p>
<p>And the other thing was,</p>
<p>I really felt it was really important</p>
<p>to role model learning, right?</p>
<p>So, I can remember when we started down the journey</p>
<p>and we went on to this thing called the Think Academy,</p>
<p>IBM&rsquo;s longtime motto had been Think.</p>
<p>And we said, okay, I&rsquo;m gonna make the first Friday</p>
<p>of every month compulsory education.</p>
<p>And, okay, I mean everybody, like everybody,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what your job is, okay?</p>
<p>When the whole company has to transform,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s gotta have some skin in this game</p>
<p>and understand it.</p>
<p>I taught the first hour of every month for four years.</p>
<p>Now-</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Okay, I had to learn something.</p>
<p>So, but it made me learn.</p>
<p>But I was like, okay, if I can teach this,</p>
<p>you can do it, right?</p>
<p>I mean, you know, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>So it was a compulsory Thursday night education for you.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m a little bit better preparer than that.</p>
<p>But yes, you&rsquo;re so right, yes.</p>
<p>So you prepare?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So like personality-wise, you like to prepare?</p>
<p>Yeah, but there&rsquo;s roots in that go back deeply.</p>
<p>Deeply, deeply, deeply.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s an interesting reason.</p>
<p>So why do, why, you&rsquo;re a preparer, my friend.</p>
<p>Yes, you are, you prepare for your interviews.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>The rest you wing?</p>
<p>Yeah, I wing most of it.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>I mean, you don&rsquo;t have to prepare everything.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t prepare everything either.</p>
<p>No, but I unfortunately wing stuff.</p>
<p>I save it till last minute.</p>
<p>I push everything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always almost late.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know why that is.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s some deep psychological thing</p>
<p>we should probably investigate.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s probably the anxiety brings out the performance.</p>
<p>That can be.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very true with some people.</p>
<p>I mean, so I&rsquo;m a programmer and engineer at heart.</p>
<p>And so programmers famously overestimate,</p>
<p>or underestimate, sorry,</p>
<p>how long that something&rsquo;s going to take.</p>
<p>And so I just, everything, I always underestimate.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost as if I want to feel this chaos</p>
<p>of anxiety of a deadline or something like this.</p>
<p>Otherwise I&rsquo;ll be lazy sitting on a beach</p>
<p>with a pina colada and relaxing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So we have to know ourselves.</p>
<p>But for you, you like to prepare.</p>
<p>Yeah, it came from a few different places.</p>
<p>I mean, one would have been as a kid,</p>
<p>I think I was not a memorizer and my brother is brilliant.</p>
<p>He can read it once, boom, done.</p>
<p>And so I always wanted to understand</p>
<p>like how something happened.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t matter what it was I was doing.</p>
<p>Whether it was algebra, theorems,</p>
<p>I always wanted, don&rsquo;t give me the answer.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t give me the answer.</p>
<p>You know, I want to figure it out, figure it out.</p>
<p>So I could reproduce it again and didn&rsquo;t have to memorize.</p>
<p>So it started with that.</p>
<p>And then over time, okay,</p>
<p>so I was in university in the seventies.</p>
<p>When I was in engineering school, I was the only woman.</p>
<p>You know, I meet people still to this day</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, oh, I remember you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yeah, sorry, I don&rsquo;t remember you.</p>
<p>There were 30 of you, one of me.</p>
<p>And I think you already get that feeling of,</p>
<p>okay, I better really study hard</p>
<p>because whatever I say is going to be remembered</p>
<p>in this class, good or bad.</p>
<p>And it started there.</p>
<p>So in some ways I did it for two reasons.</p>
<p>Early on, I think it was a shield for confidence.</p>
<p>The more I studied, the more prepared I was,</p>
<p>the more confident.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably still true to this day.</p>
<p>The second reason I did it evolved over time</p>
<p>and became different to prepare.</p>
<p>If I was really prepared, then when we&rsquo;re in the moment,</p>
<p>I can really listen to you.</p>
<p>See, because I don&rsquo;t have to be doing all this stuff</p>
<p>on the fly in my head.</p>
<p>And I could actually take things I know</p>
<p>and maybe help the situation.</p>
<p>So it really became a way that I could be present</p>
<p>in the moment.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s something a lot of people,</p>
<p>that in the moment, I learned it from my husband.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t prepare by the way at all.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not it.</p>
<p>But I watched the in the moment part.</p>
<p>The negative example.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not going to change that.</p>
<p>As he says, he&rsquo;s a type Z, I&rsquo;m an A, okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how love works, yeah.</p>
<p>And I have been married 43 years and that seems to work.</p>
<p>But that idea that you could be in the moment with people</p>
<p>is a really important thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the preparation gives you the freedom</p>
<p>to really be present.</p>
<p>So just to linger on, you mentioned your brother.</p>
<p>And it seems like in the book that you really had</p>
<p>to work hard when you studied to sort of,</p>
<p>given that you weren&rsquo;t good at memorization,</p>
<p>you really, truly, deeply wanted to understand the stuff</p>
<p>and you put in the hard work.</p>
<p>And that seems to persist throughout your career.</p>
<p>So, you know, hard work is often associated with,</p>
<p>sort of has negative associations.</p>
<p>Well, maybe with burnout, with dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Is there some aspect of hard work at the core of who you are</p>
<p>that led to happiness for you?</p>
<p>Did you enjoy it?</p>
<p>I enjoyed it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll be the first.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m really careful to say that to people</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think everyone should associate,</p>
<p>gee, to do what you did, you have to,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only one route there, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just not true.</p>
<p>And I do it because I like it.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m careful.</p>
<p>And as time goes on, you have to be careful</p>
<p>as more and more people watch you,</p>
<p>whether you like it, you&rsquo;re a role model or not,</p>
<p>you are a role model for people,</p>
<p>whether you know it, like it, want it, does not matter.</p>
<p>I learned that the hard way.</p>
<p>And I would have to say to people,</p>
<p>hey, just because I do this does not mean,</p>
<p>I do it for these reasons, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to be really explicit.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d come to believe,</p>
<p>usually when people say the word power,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, do you have a positive or negative notion</p>
<p>when I say the word power?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll just do it.</p>
<p>Probably negative one, yeah.</p>
<p>For some stereotype or some view</p>
<p>that somebody&rsquo;s abused it in some way.</p>
<p>You can read the newspaper, somebody&rsquo;s doing something.</p>
<p>Personal people, like I&rsquo;ll ask people, do you want power?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, oh no, I&rsquo;d rather do good.</p>
<p>And I think the irony is you need power to do good.</p>
<p>And so that sort of led me down to,</p>
<p>and it was, I thought about my own life, right?</p>
<p>Because it starts in a, like many of us,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have a lot, but you don&rsquo;t know that</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re like everybody else around you at that time.</p>
<p>And on one end, tragedy, right?</p>
<p>My father leaves my mother homeless,</p>
<p>no money, no food, nothing, four kids.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s never worked a day in her life outside of a home.</p>
<p>And I, the irony of that here,</p>
<p>I would end up as the ninth CEO</p>
<p>of one of America&rsquo;s iconic companies.</p>
<p>And now I co-chair this group 110.</p>
<p>And that journey, I said, the biggest thing I learned was</p>
<p>you could do really hard, meaningful things</p>
<p>in a positive way.</p>
<p>So now you asked me about why do I work so hard?</p>
<p>I ended up writing the book in three pieces for this reason.</p>
<p>When you really think of your life and power,</p>
<p>I thought it kind of fell like a pebble in water.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a ring about,</p>
<p>you really care about yourself</p>
<p>and like the power of yourself, power of me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a time it transcends</p>
<p>to that you are working within for others</p>
<p>and another moment when it becomes like about society.</p>
<p>So my hard work, I&rsquo;d ask you,</p>
<p>one day sit really hard and think about</p>
<p>when you close your eyes,</p>
<p>who do you see from your early life, right?</p>
<p>And what did you learn?</p>
<p>And maybe it&rsquo;s not that hard for you.</p>
<p>I mean, it was, it&rsquo;s funny the things then,</p>
<p>if I really looked at it, it&rsquo;s no surprise what I do today.</p>
<p>And that hard work part, my great grandma,</p>
<p>as you and I were comparing notes on Russia, right?</p>
<p>And never spoke English, spoke Russian,</p>
<p>came here to this country, was a cleaning person</p>
<p>at the Wrigley Building in Chicago.</p>
<p>Yet, if she hadn&rsquo;t saved every dime she made,</p>
<p>my mother wouldn&rsquo;t have a home</p>
<p>and wouldn&rsquo;t have had a car, right?</p>
<p>What did I learn from that?</p>
<p>Hard work.</p>
<p>In fact, actually, when I went to college,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like, you know, you really should be on a farm.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re so big and strong.</p>
<p>You know, that was her view.</p>
<p>And then my grandmother, another tragic life.</p>
<p>What did she do though?</p>
<p>And think how long, that&rsquo;s in the 40s, the 50s.</p>
<p>She made lampshades and she taught me how to sew, right?</p>
<p>So I could sew clothes when we couldn&rsquo;t afford them.</p>
<p>But my memory of my grandma is working seven days a week,</p>
<p>sewing lampshades.</p>
<p>And then here comes my mom in her situation</p>
<p>who climbs her way out of it.</p>
<p>So I associate that with, well, strong women, by the way,</p>
<p>all strong women.</p>
<p>And I associate hard work with how you are sure</p>
<p>you can always take care of yourself.</p>
<p>And so I think that the roots go way back there.</p>
<p>And they were always teaching something, right?</p>
<p>My great grandma was teaching me how to cook,</p>
<p>how to work a farm, even though I didn&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>to be on a farm.</p>
<p>My grandma taught me, you know, here&rsquo;s how to sew,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s how to run a business.</p>
<p>And then my mother would teach us that, look,</p>
<p>with just a little bit of education,</p>
<p>look at the difference it could make, right?</p>
<p>So anyways, that&rsquo;s a long answer to,</p>
<p>I think that hard work thing is really deeply rooted</p>
<p>from that background.</p>
<p>And it gives you a way out from hard times.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, I think I&rsquo;ve seen you on other podcasts</p>
<p>say, I thought I did, do you want a plan B?</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t you say, no, you would not like a plan B?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t want a plan B.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re like, I would prefer my back up against,</p>
<p>am I remembering?</p>
<p>You have a story like that.</p>
<p>You seem to like, at least certain moments in your life</p>
<p>seem to do well in desperate times.</p>
<p>True enough, true enough, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I learned that very well.</p>
<p>But I also think that maybe this isn&rsquo;t the same kind</p>
<p>of plan B.</p>
<p>I think of it as, like I was taught,</p>
<p>always be able to take care of yourself.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t have to rely on someone else.</p>
<p>And I think that to me, so that&rsquo;s my plan B,</p>
<p>I can take care of myself.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s even after what I lived through with my father,</p>
<p>I thought, well, this is at a bar for bad.</p>
<p>After this, nothing&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>And that is a very freeing thought.</p>
<p>The being able to take care of yourself,</p>
<p>is that, you mean practically,</p>
<p>or do you mean just a self-belief that I&rsquo;ll figure it out?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll figure it out, and practically both, right?</p>
<p>So you wrote, quote,</p>
<p>I vividly remember the last two weeks of my freshman year,</p>
<p>when I only had 25 cents left.</p>
<p>I put the quarter in a clear plastic box on my desk</p>
<p>and just stared at it.</p>
<p>This is it, I thought, no more money.</p>
<p>So do you think there&rsquo;s some aspect of that financial stress,</p>
<p>even desperation, just being hungry?</p>
<p>Did that play a role in that drive that led to your success</p>
<p>to be the CEO of one of the great companies ever?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really interesting question,</p>
<p>because I was just talking to another colleague</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s CEO of another great American company this weekend.</p>
<p>And he mentioned to me about all this adversity,</p>
<p>and he said, or I said to him, I said,</p>
<p>do you think part of your success</p>
<p>is because you had bad stuff happen?</p>
<p>And he said, yes, you know?</p>
<p>And so I guess I&rsquo;d be lying if I didn&rsquo;t say,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you have to have tragedy,</p>
<p>but it does teach you one really important thing</p>
<p>is that there is always a way forward, always,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s in your control.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s probably wisdom for mentorship there,</p>
<p>or whether you&rsquo;re a parent or a mentor,</p>
<p>that easy times don&rsquo;t result in growth.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve heard a lot of my friends,</p>
<p>and they worry, they say,</p>
<p>gee, my kids have never had bad times.</p>
<p>And so what happens here?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, is it required?</p>
<p>And why you end up, not required, but it sure doesn&rsquo;t hurt.</p>
<p>You had this good line about advice you were given,</p>
<p>that growth and comfort never coexist.</p>
<p>Growth and comfort never coexist.</p>
<p>And you have to get used to that thought.</p>
<p>If someone said that they think of me</p>
<p>like one of the more profound sort of lessons I had,</p>
<p>and the irony is, it&rsquo;s from my husband,</p>
<p>which is even more funny, actually.</p>
<p>You could just steal it.</p>
<p>Oh, I have, I have, shamelessly, as he&rsquo;ll tell you.</p>
<p>Okay, so the story behind growth and comfort never coexist.</p>
<p>But honestly, I think it&rsquo;s been a really freeing thought</p>
<p>for me, and it&rsquo;s helped me immensely since.</p>
<p>Mid-career, and as I write about it in the book,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m mid-career, and I&rsquo;ve been running</p>
<p>a pretty big business, actually.</p>
<p>And the fella I work for is gonna get a new job.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gonna get promoted.</p>
<p>He calls me, and he says, hey, you&rsquo;re gonna get my job.</p>
<p>I really want you to have it.</p>
<p>And I said to him, no way.</p>
<p>I said, I&rsquo;m not ready for that job.</p>
<p>I got a lot more things I gotta learn.</p>
<p>That is like a huge job.</p>
<p>Round the world, every product line, development,</p>
<p>you name it, every function, I can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>He looked at me.</p>
<p>He says, well, I think you should go to the interview.</p>
<p>I went to the interview the next day.</p>
<p>Blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Guy says to me, looks at me, and he says,</p>
<p>I wanna offer you that job.</p>
<p>And I said, I would like to think about it.</p>
<p>I said, I wanna go home and talk to my husband about it.</p>
<p>Kinda looked at me, okay.</p>
<p>I went home.</p>
<p>My husband is sitting there, and he says to me,</p>
<p>I went on and on about the story, et cetera.</p>
<p>And he says, do you think a man</p>
<p>would have answered it that way?</p>
<p>And I said, hmm.</p>
<p>He says, I know you.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, six months, you&rsquo;re gonna be bored.</p>
<p>And all you can think of is what you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And he said, and I know these other people.</p>
<p>You have way more skill than them,</p>
<p>and they think they could do it.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, why?</p>
<p>And for me, it internalized this feeling that,</p>
<p>I am gonna say something that&rsquo;s a bit stereotyped,</p>
<p>that it resonates with many, many women,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll ask you if it does after,</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;re the most harsh critic of themselves.</p>
<p>And so this idea that I won&rsquo;t grow</p>
<p>unless I can feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean I always have to show it, by the way.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I meant growth and comfort can never coexist.</p>
<p>So I got, I was like, he&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>Now, the end of that story is I went in and I took the job.</p>
<p>When I went back to the man who was really my mentor</p>
<p>looking out for me, and he looked at me and he said,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t ever do that again.</p>
<p>And I said, I understand.</p>
<p>Because it was okay to be uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have to use it.</p>
<p>I mean, now I would take stock of the things I can do,</p>
<p>right, and really think,</p>
<p>or I look for times to be uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Because I know if I am nervous,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re ever nervous to meet me.</p>
<p>We never met in real person.</p>
<p>No, 100%.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still terrified.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>But then it means you&rsquo;re learning something, right?</p>
<p>Holding it together.</p>
<p>So that, to me, matters.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Maybe you could speak to that,</p>
<p>the sort of the self-critical thing inside your brain.</p>
<p>Because I think sometimes it&rsquo;s talked about</p>
<p>that women have that.</p>
<p>But I have that, definitely.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s not just solely a property</p>
<p>of women in the workplace.</p>
<p>But I also want to sort of push back on the idea</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s a bad thing that you should silence.</p>
<p>Because I think that anxiety,</p>
<p>that leads to growth also.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like this discomfort.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this weird balance you have to have</p>
<p>between that self-critical engine and confidence.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s a good point.</p>
<p>You have to kind of dance.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re super confident,</p>
<p>people will value you higher.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re way too confident,</p>
<p>maybe in the short term you&rsquo;ll gain,</p>
<p>but in the long term you won&rsquo;t grow.</p>
<p>Very good point.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t really disagree with that.</p>
<p>And to me, even when I took on jobs,</p>
<p>I always felt people say,</p>
<p>well, is it, what point are you confident enough?</p>
<p>And I came to sort of believe,</p>
<p>again, a theme of my beliefs,</p>
<p>that if I was willing to ask lots of questions</p>
<p>and understood enough, that&rsquo;s all I needed to know.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about your husband a little bit.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>So you write in the book.</p>
<p>You write in the book.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just jumping around.</p>
<p>Like I said, I&rsquo;m a bit of a romantic.</p>
<p>So how did you meet your husband?</p>
<p>I met my husband when I was 19 years old.</p>
<p>So I was a young kid.</p>
<p>And I met him when I had a General Motors scholarship.</p>
<p>So I was at Northwestern University</p>
<p>through my first two years.</p>
<p>Had a lot of loans, financial aid.</p>
<p>And a professor said,</p>
<p>hey, you should sign up for this interview.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re looking to bring forward diverse candidates</p>
<p>through their management track.</p>
<p>Now these programs don&rsquo;t exist anymore like that.</p>
<p>They will pay your tuition, your room and board,</p>
<p>your expenses at Northwestern, other Ivy League schools,</p>
<p>these very expensive schools.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;d be a good fit.</p>
<p>I am eternally thankful for that advice.</p>
<p>I went and I interviewed.</p>
<p>I actually got the scholarship.</p>
<p>I mean, without it, I&rsquo;d have graduated</p>
<p>with hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt.</p>
<p>So part of that was in the summer,</p>
<p>I had to work in Detroit.</p>
<p>I lived in a little room by a cement plant.</p>
<p>Not theirs, but I mean, that&rsquo;s all I could afford.</p>
<p>Very romantic.</p>
<p>Very, very romantic.</p>
<p>And the person who owned the house said,</p>
<p>hey, I&rsquo;m having a party, you&rsquo;re not invited.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to fix you up with someone tonight.</p>
<p>And that turned out to be my husband.</p>
<p>And so it was a blind date is how we very first met.</p>
<p>And then it was over.</p>
<p>It was, the story was written.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s, if it&rsquo;s okay, just zoom out to,</p>
<p>you mentioned power and good power a few times.</p>
<p>So if we can just even talk about it.</p>
<p>Your book is called Good Power,</p>
<p>Leading Positive Change in Our Lives, Work, and World.</p>
<p>What is good power?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the essence of good power?</p>
<p>So the essence of it would be doing something hard</p>
<p>or meaningful, but in a positive way.</p>
<p>I would also tell you, I hope one day I&rsquo;m remembered</p>
<p>for how I did things, not just for what I did.</p>
<p>I think that could almost be more important.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s a choice we can all make.</p>
<p>So the essence to me of good power,</p>
<p>if I had to contrast good to bad, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>would be that first off,</p>
<p>you have to embrace and navigate tension.</p>
<p>This is the world we live in.</p>
<p>And by embracing tension, not running from it,</p>
<p>you would bridge divides that unites people,</p>
<p>not divides them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hard thing to do, but you can do it.</p>
<p>You do it with respect, which is the opposite of fear.</p>
<p>A lot of people think the way to get things done is fear.</p>
<p>And then the third thing would be,</p>
<p>you gotta celebrate some progress versus perfection.</p>
<p>Because I also think that&rsquo;s what stops</p>
<p>a lot of things from happening.</p>
<p>Because if you go for whatever your definition</p>
<p>of perfect is, it&rsquo;s either polarization or paralyzation.</p>
<p>I mean, something happens in there.</p>
<p>Versus, no, no, no, I can,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry about getting to that actual exact endpoint.</p>
<p>If I keep taking a step forward of progress,</p>
<p>really tough stuff can get done.</p>
<p>And so my view of that is like, honestly,</p>
<p>I hope it can, you know,</p>
<p>I said it&rsquo;s like a memoir with purpose.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only doing it, it was a really hard thing for me to do,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t actually talk about all these things.</p>
<p>And I had to, nobody cares about your like,</p>
<p>scientific description of this.</p>
<p>They want the stories in your life to bring it alive.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a memoir with purpose.</p>
<p>And in the writing of it, it became the power of me,</p>
<p>the power of we, and the power of us.</p>
<p>The idea that you build a foundation when you&rsquo;re young.</p>
<p>Mostly from my work life, the power of we,</p>
<p>which says, I kind of, in retrospect,</p>
<p>could see five principles on how to really drive change</p>
<p>that would be done in a good way.</p>
<p>And then eventually you could scale that,</p>
<p>the power really of us,</p>
<p>which is what I&rsquo;m doing about finding better jobs</p>
<p>for more people now that I co-chair an organization</p>
<p>called 110.</p>
<p>So that essence of navigate tensions,</p>
<p>do it respectfully, celebrate progress,</p>
<p>and indulge me one more minute,</p>
<p>these sort of, again, it&rsquo;s retrospect that I,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know this in the moment.</p>
<p>I had to learn it.</p>
<p>I learned it.</p>
<p>I am blessed by a lot of people I worked with and around.</p>
<p>But some of the principles, like the first one is,</p>
<p>says if you&rsquo;re gonna do something, change something,</p>
<p>do something, you gotta be in service of something.</p>
<p>Being in service of is really different than serving.</p>
<p>Super different.</p>
<p>And like, I just had my knee replaced.</p>
<p>And I interviewed all these doctors.</p>
<p>You can tell the difference</p>
<p>between the guy who&rsquo;s gonna do a surgery.</p>
<p>Hey, my surgery&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t care whether you can walk</p>
<p>and do the stuff you wanted to do again,</p>
<p>but because my surgery is fine.</p>
<p>Your hardware is good.</p>
<p>I actually had some trouble.</p>
<p>And I had a doctor who was like,</p>
<p>you know, this doesn&rsquo;t sound right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m coming to you.</p>
<p>The surgery was fine.</p>
<p>It was me that was reacting wrong to it.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t care until I could walk again.</p>
<p>Okay, there&rsquo;s a big difference in those two things.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s true in any business you have.</p>
<p>A waiter serves you food.</p>
<p>Okay, he serves his food, he did his job.</p>
<p>Or did he care, he had a good time.</p>
<p>So that thought to be in service of,</p>
<p>it took me a while to get that,</p>
<p>like to try to write it, to get that across,</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s like so fundamental.</p>
<p>If people were really in service of something,</p>
<p>you gotta believe that if I fulfill your needs,</p>
<p>at the end of the day, mine will be fulfilled.</p>
<p>And that is that essence that makes it so different.</p>
<p>And then the second part,</p>
<p>second principle is about building belief,</p>
<p>which is I gotta hope you&rsquo;ll voluntarily believe</p>
<p>in a new future or in some alternate reality,</p>
<p>and you will use your discretionary energy</p>
<p>versus me ordering you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll get so much more done.</p>
<p>Then the third, change and endure.</p>
<p>We kind of talked about that earlier.</p>
<p>Focus more on the how and the skills.</p>
<p>And then the part on good tech and being resilient.</p>
<p>So anyways, I just felt that like good tech,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s a tech company.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what you do today.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some fundamental things you gotta do.</p>
<p>In fact, pick up today&rsquo;s any newspaper, right?</p>
<p>Chat GPT, you&rsquo;re an AI guy.</p>
<p>All right?</p>
<p>I believe one of the tenants of good tech is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like responsibility for the longterm.</p>
<p>It says, so if you&rsquo;re gonna invent something,</p>
<p>you better look at its upside and its downside.</p>
<p>Like we did quantum computing.</p>
<p>Great, a lot of great stuff, right?</p>
<p>Materials development, risk management calculations,</p>
<p>endless lists one day.</p>
<p>On the other side, it can break encryption.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a bad thing.</p>
<p>So we work equally hard on all the algorithms</p>
<p>that would sustain quantum.</p>
<p>I think with chat, okay, great.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s equal, and there are people working on it,</p>
<p>but like, okay, the things that say,</p>
<p>hey, I can tell this was written with that, right?</p>
<p>Because the implications on how people learn, right?</p>
<p>If this is not a great thing,</p>
<p>if all it does is do your homework,</p>
<p>that is not the idea of homework</p>
<p>as someone who liked to study so hard.</p>
<p>But anyways, you get my point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the upside and the downside.</p>
<p>And that there could be much larger implications</p>
<p>that are much more difficult to predict,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s our responsibility to really work hard</p>
<p>to figure that out.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was talking to AI ethics a decade ago,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, why won&rsquo;t anybody listen to us?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another one of those values things</p>
<p>that you realize, hey, if I&rsquo;m gonna bring technology</p>
<p>in the world, I better bring it safely, right?</p>
<p>And that to me comes with,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re an older company that&rsquo;s been around,</p>
<p>you realize that society gave you a license to operate,</p>
<p>and it can take it away.</p>
<p>And we see that happen to companies.</p>
<p>And therefore, you&rsquo;re like, okay,</p>
<p>like why I feel so strong about skills.</p>
<p>Hey, if I&rsquo;m gonna bring in,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna create all these new jobs, job dislocation,</p>
<p>then I should help.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to help people get new skills.</p>
<p>Anyways, that&rsquo;s a long answer to a good tech,</p>
<p>but the idea that there&rsquo;s kind of, in retrospect,</p>
<p>a set of principles you could look at</p>
<p>and maybe learn something</p>
<p>from my sort of rocky road through there.</p>
<p>But it started with the power of we,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s that big leap, I think,</p>
<p>that propagates through the things you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>which is the leap from focusing on yourself</p>
<p>to the focusing on others, so that having that empathy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve said, at some point in our lives and careers,</p>
<p>our attention turns from ourselves to others.</p>
<p>We still have our own goals,</p>
<p>but we recognize that our actions affect many,</p>
<p>that it is impossible to achieve anything</p>
<p>truly meaningful alone.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, to you, I think, maybe you can correct me,</p>
<p>but ultimate good power is about collaboration</p>
<p>and maybe, in large companies,</p>
<p>like delegation on great teams.</p>
<p>The ultimate good power</p>
<p>is actually doing something for society.</p>
<p>That would be my ultimate definition of good power,</p>
<p>by the way.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s about the results of those things.</p>
<p>Yeah, but how it&rsquo;s done, right?</p>
<p>The how it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>And so, you know, when you said a leap,</p>
<p>do you think people make a leap</p>
<p>when they go from thinking about themselves to others?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s a leap,</p>
<p>or do you think it kind of just is a sort of slow point?</p>
<p>I think the leap is in deciding that this is a,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like deciding that you will care about others,</p>
<p>that this is, it&rsquo;s like a leap</p>
<p>of going to the gym for the first time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, yes, it takes a long time to develop that</p>
<p>and to actually care,</p>
<p>but that decision that I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>actually care about other human beings, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think, or at least, like, yeah,</p>
<p>it just feels like a deliberate action you take of empathy.</p>
<p>Yeah, because sometimes I think it happens a little,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s maybe not as deliberate.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a little bit more gradual</p>
<p>because it might happen because you realize that,</p>
<p>jeez, I can&rsquo;t get this done alone,</p>
<p>so I got to have other people with me,</p>
<p>but how do I get them to help me do something?</p>
<p>So I think it does happen a little bit more gradually,</p>
<p>and as you get more confident,</p>
<p>you start to not think so much that it&rsquo;s about you,</p>
<p>and you start to think about this other thing</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why I felt it was a little more gradual.</p>
<p>I also felt like, I can remember so well,</p>
<p>this idea that, again, now we&rsquo;re in the 80s, 90s,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a woman, I&rsquo;m in technology,</p>
<p>and I was down in Australia at a conference,</p>
<p>and I gave this great speech, again,</p>
<p>me, power of me, I&rsquo;m thinking I gave this great speech,</p>
<p>financial services, this man walks up to me after,</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s gonna ask me some great question,</p>
<p>and he said to me,</p>
<p>I wish my daughter could have been here.</p>
<p>And in that moment,</p>
<p>and at that point, up to then,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d always been about, look,</p>
<p>please don&rsquo;t notice I&rsquo;m a woman, do not notice that.</p>
<p>I just want to be recognized for my work.</p>
<p>Crossing over from me to we, like it or not,</p>
<p>I was a role model for some number of people.</p>
<p>And maybe I didn&rsquo;t want to be,</p>
<p>but that didn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>So I could either accept that and embrace it or not.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a good example of that transition.</p>
<p>I did have a little epiphany with that happening.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m like, okay,</p>
<p>because I would always be like,</p>
<p>no, I won&rsquo;t go on a women&rsquo;s conference.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t talk here.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t, no, no, no.</p>
<p>But then I sort of realized, wait a second,</p>
<p>that old saying, you cannot be what you cannot see.</p>
<p>And I said to myself, wait a second, okay,</p>
<p>I am in these positions I have a responsibility to,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s to others.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I meant.</p>
<p>I felt like it can be somewhat gradual that you come,</p>
<p>and you may have these like pivotal moments</p>
<p>that you see it, but then you feel it,</p>
<p>and you sort of move over that transom</p>
<p>into the power of we.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of the most powerful tech leaders ever.</p>
<p>And as you mentioned the word power,</p>
<p>the old saying goes,</p>
<p>power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.</p>
<p>Was there an aspect of power that was,</p>
<p>that you had to resist its ability to corrupt your mind,</p>
<p>to sort of delude you into thinking</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re smarter than you are, that kind of,</p>
<p>all the ways that power corrupts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very dangerous, I agree with that.</p>
<p>I mean, I think you gotta be careful</p>
<p>who you surround yourself with.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I would answer that question, right?</p>
<p>And people who will hold the mirror up to you</p>
<p>can be done in a very positive way, by the way.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean, you know, but that we&rsquo;re sycophants,</p>
<p>you cannot have that, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like, I always say to someone like,</p>
<p>hey, listen to me, tell me what would make me better,</p>
<p>or do something, or I have a husband</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll do that for me quite easily, by the way.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll always tell me.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s the one that can give you some criticism sometimes?</p>
<p>I have been surrounded myself</p>
<p>with a number of people that will do that,</p>
<p>and I think you have to have that.</p>
<p>I had a woman that worked with me for a very long time,</p>
<p>and at one time we were competitors,</p>
<p>and then at some point she started to work for me,</p>
<p>and stayed with me for quite a while,</p>
<p>and she was one of the few people</p>
<p>that would tell me the truth,</p>
<p>and you know, sometimes I&rsquo;m like, enough already.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;d be like, do not roll your eyes at this,</p>
<p>and you absolutely have got to have that,</p>
<p>and I think it also comes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll go back to my complete commitment</p>
<p>to inclusion and diversity,</p>
<p>because you gotta have that variety around you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll get a better product,</p>
<p>and a better answer at the end of the day,</p>
<p>and so that, to resist that allure,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s about who you surround yourself with.</p>
<p>Current politics would say that, too.</p>
<p>So you write about, and in general,</p>
<p>you value diversity a lot,</p>
<p>so can you speak to almost like philosophically,</p>
<p>what does diversity mean to you?</p>
<p>Diversity to me means I&rsquo;m gonna get a better product,</p>
<p>a better answer, I value different views,</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s inclusion.</p>
<p>So I always say inclusion,</p>
<p>diversity&rsquo;s a number, inclusion&rsquo;s a choice,</p>
<p>and you can make that choice every single day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good line.</p>
<p>I really believe, and I&rsquo;ve witnessed it,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve had, when my teams are diverse,</p>
<p>I get a better answer.</p>
<p>My friends are diverse, I have a better life.</p>
<p>I mean, all these kinds of things,</p>
<p>and so I also believe it&rsquo;s like no silver thread.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no easy way.</p>
<p>You have to authentically believe it.</p>
<p>I mean, do you authentically believe</p>
<p>that diversity&rsquo;s a good thing?</p>
<p>Yeah, but I believe that diversity, like broadly,</p>
<p>A thought, I very broadly define it.</p>
<p>Yeah, so like there&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>sometimes the way diversity&rsquo;s looked at,</p>
<p>or the way diversity&rsquo;s used today</p>
<p>is like surface-level characteristics,</p>
<p>which are also important,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re usually reflective of something else,</p>
<p>which is a diversity of background,</p>
<p>a diversity of thought, a diversity of struggle.</p>
<p>Some people that grew up middle-class versus poor,</p>
<p>different countries, different motivations, all of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s beautiful when different people</p>
<p>from very different walks of life get together.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s beautiful to see.</p>
<p>But like sometimes it&rsquo;s very difficult to get at that</p>
<p>on a sheet of paper of the characteristics</p>
<p>that defines the diversity.</p>
<p>I know, so it is, and it&rsquo;s just like,</p>
<p>oh, I can&rsquo;t hire exactly, or if I&rsquo;m trying to,</p>
<p>and, but I do know one thing, that when people say,</p>
<p>well, I can&rsquo;t find these kind of people I&rsquo;m looking for,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you&rsquo;re just not looking in the right places.</p>
<p>Right, you have to open up, like just like you said.</p>
<p>You gotta really open up new pools, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, you have to think, like everybody,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to have a PhD, just like you said, yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to say it, you know, I know it&rsquo;s very valuable,</p>
<p>but you have, trust me, but.</p>
<p>Well, it could, just like you said,</p>
<p>it could even be a negative.</p>
<p>So you mentioned, like for good power,</p>
<p>you are a CEO, you were a CEO for a long time</p>
<p>of a public company.</p>
<p>Were there times when there was pressure to sacrifice</p>
<p>what is good for the world, for the bottom line,</p>
<p>in order to do what&rsquo;s good for the company?</p>
<p>Yeah, there were probably,</p>
<p>there were a lot of times for that.</p>
<p>I mean, I think every company faces that today,</p>
<p>in that I always felt like there&rsquo;s so much discussion</p>
<p>about stakeholder capitalism, right?</p>
<p>Do you just serve a shareholder, or do you have multiple?</p>
<p>I have always found, and I&rsquo;ve been very vocal</p>
<p>about that topic, that, and I participated,</p>
<p>the Business Roundtable wrote up a new purpose statement</p>
<p>that had multiple stakeholders.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s common sense.</p>
<p>Like, if you&rsquo;re gonna be 100 years old,</p>
<p>you only get there because you actually do, at some time,</p>
<p>balance all these different stakeholders</p>
<p>in what it is that you do, and short-term, long-term,</p>
<p>all these trade-offs.</p>
<p>And I always say, people who write about it,</p>
<p>they write about it black and white,</p>
<p>but I have to live in a gray world.</p>
<p>Nothing I&rsquo;ve ever done has been in a black and white world,</p>
<p>hardly, maybe things of values that I had to answer,</p>
<p>but most of it is gray.</p>
<p>And so, I think back, lots of different decisions.</p>
<p>I think back, as you would well remember,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a student of history,</p>
<p>IBM was one of the, really, the originators</p>
<p>of the semiconductor industry,</p>
<p>and certainly of commercializing the semiconductor industry.</p>
<p>Great R&amp;D and manufacturing, but it is a game of volume.</p>
<p>And so, when I came on, we were still manufacturing R&amp;D</p>
<p>and manufacturing our own chips.</p>
<p>We were losing a lot of money.</p>
<p>Yet here, we had to fight a war on cloud and AI.</p>
<p>And so, okay, now shareholders would say,</p>
<p>fine, shut it down.</p>
<p>Okay, those chips also power</p>
<p>some of the most important systems</p>
<p>that power the banks of today.</p>
<p>If I just shut it down, well, what would that do?</p>
<p>And so, okay, the answer wasn&rsquo;t just stop it.</p>
<p>The answer wasn&rsquo;t just keep putting money into it.</p>
<p>The answer wasn&rsquo;t, we had to kind of sit</p>
<p>in an uncomfortable spot till we found a way.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s gonna sound so basic,</p>
<p>but you, as an engineer, understand it.</p>
<p>We had to separate.</p>
<p>It was a very integrated process</p>
<p>of research, development, and manufacturing.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d also, you&rsquo;d be perfecting things</p>
<p>in manufacturing, and these were</p>
<p>our very high-performance chips.</p>
<p>We had to be able to separate those.</p>
<p>We eventually found a way to do that</p>
<p>so that we could take the manufacturing elsewhere,</p>
<p>and we would maintain the R&amp;D.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a great example of the question you just asked,</p>
<p>because people would have applauded.</p>
<p>Others would have been, this was horrible.</p>
<p>Or we had a financial roadmap that had been put in place</p>
<p>that said, I&rsquo;ll make this amount of EPS by this date.</p>
<p>There came a time we couldn&rsquo;t honor it</p>
<p>because we had to invest.</p>
<p>And so, there&rsquo;s a million of these decisions.</p>
<p>I think most people that run firms, any size firm,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just one right after another like that.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re always making that short and long tension</p>
<p>of what am I giving up?</p>
<p>Well, what is that partnership like with the clients?</p>
<p>Because you work with gigantic businesses.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s it like sort of really forming</p>
<p>a great relationship with them,</p>
<p>understanding what their needs are,</p>
<p>being in service of their needs?</p>
<p>Yeah, very simple.</p>
<p>Honor your promises.</p>
<p>And that happens over time.</p>
<p>I mean, in service of, which is often why</p>
<p>you can work with competitors,</p>
<p>because if you are really in service of you</p>
<p>and you need something, it takes two of us to do it,</p>
<p>that becomes easier to do.</p>
<p>Because I really, we both care, you get what you needed.</p>
<p>And so, I can remember during one of the times</p>
<p>I was on a European trip.</p>
<p>And at the time, a lot of, and this is still true,</p>
<p>about views about technology and national technology giants</p>
<p>and global ones and the pros and the cons.</p>
<p>And countries want their own national champions,</p>
<p>quite obvious.</p>
<p>I mean, if I&rsquo;m France or Germany.</p>
<p>And there was a lot of discussion about security and data</p>
<p>and who was getting access to what.</p>
<p>And I can remember being in one of the,</p>
<p>I was with Chancellor Merkel, had met her many times.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s very well prepared, very well prepared.</p>
<p>Every time she would know.</p>
<p>And I started to explain all these things about why,</p>
<p>how we don&rsquo;t share data, who it belongs to.</p>
<p>Our systems never had backdoors.</p>
<p>And she sort of stopped me.</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re one of the good guys, like, stop.</p>
<p>Now, that wasn&rsquo;t about me personally.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s talking about a company that&rsquo;s acted consistent</p>
<p>with values for decades, right?</p>
<p>So to me, how you work with those big kind of clients</p>
<p>is you honor your promises.</p>
<p>You say what you do and you do what you say.</p>
<p>And you act with values over a long period of time.</p>
<p>And that, to me, people say we&rsquo;re valued.</p>
<p>It is not a fluffy thing.</p>
<p>It is not a fluffy thing.</p>
<p>I mean, if I was starting a company now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d spend a lot of time on that.</p>
<p>On, you know, why we do what we do</p>
<p>and why some things are tolerable and some things,</p>
<p>you know, what your fundamental beliefs are.</p>
<p>And many people sort of zoom past that stage, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay for a while.</p>
<p>And never sacrifice that.</p>
<p>You would never sacrifice that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you can.</p>
<p>So there was a lot of pressure when you took over as CEO</p>
<p>and there was 22 consecutive quarters of revenue decline</p>
<p>between 2012 and the summer of 2017.</p>
<p>So it was a stressful time.</p>
<p>Maybe not.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can correct me on that.</p>
<p>So as a CEO, what was it like going through that time</p>
<p>with the decisions, the tensions in terms of investing</p>
<p>versus making a profit?</p>
<p>I always felt that.</p>
<p>That sense of urgency was so high.</p>
<p>And even if I was calm on the outside.</p>
<p>Because you have one of the world&rsquo;s largest pensions.</p>
<p>So so many people depend on you.</p>
<p>You have a huge workforce.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re depending on you.</p>
<p>You have clients whose businesses don&rsquo;t run</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t perform, et cetera.</p>
<p>And shareholders, of course, right?</p>
<p>And so, but I also am really clear.</p>
<p>This was perhaps the largest reinvention</p>
<p>IBM ever had to undertake.</p>
<p>Had a board that understood that.</p>
<p>In fact, some of the headlines were like,</p>
<p>this is existential, right?</p>
<p>I mean, nobody gives you a right to exist forever.</p>
<p>And there aren&rsquo;t many techs.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the student of it.</p>
<p>They are gone.</p>
<p>They are all gone.</p>
<p>And so if we didn&rsquo;t reinvent ourselves,</p>
<p>we were gonna be extinct.</p>
<p>And so now, but you&rsquo;re big.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like changing.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that old saying?</p>
<p>Can I change the wheels while the train&rsquo;s running</p>
<p>or something like that?</p>
<p>Or the engines while the plane&rsquo;s flying?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what you have to do.</p>
<p>And that took time.</p>
<p>And so, you know,</p>
<p>Lex, do I wish it would have been faster?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>But the team worked so hard.</p>
<p>And in that timeframe, 50% of the portfolio was changed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very large company.</p>
<p>And I also divested $10 billion of businesses.</p>
<p>So if you would look at that growth rate</p>
<p>without divestitures and currency,</p>
<p>which now today everyone talks about currency.</p>
<p>Back then, we were the only international guy.</p>
<p>Net of divestitures and currency, the growth was flat.</p>
<p>Is flat great?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>But flat for a big transformation?</p>
<p>I was really proud of the team for what they did.</p>
<p>That is actually pretty miraculous</p>
<p>to have made it through that.</p>
<p>I have my little nephew one day</p>
<p>and he would see it on TV occasionally</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;d be criticism.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;d say, you know,</p>
<p>auntie, does it make you mad when they talk mean?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I just looked at him and I said,</p>
<p>you know, he says, how do you feel?</p>
<p>I said, look, I&rsquo;m doing what has to be done.</p>
<p>And I happened to be the one there.</p>
<p>And if you have great conviction, and I did,</p>
<p>a great conviction, I knew it was the right thing.</p>
<p>I knew it would be needed for IBM to live its second century.</p>
<p>And so, and my successor, they have picked up, gone forward.</p>
<p>You go back, we did the acquisition of Red Hat.</p>
<p>I mean, we had to find our way on cloud, right?</p>
<p>We were late to it.</p>
<p>So we had to find our way.</p>
<p>And eventually that led us to hybrid cloud.</p>
<p>We did a lot of work with Red Hat back in 2017.</p>
<p>Oh, we&rsquo;d always done a lot of work with them.</p>
<p>We actually were one of the first investors</p>
<p>when they were first formed.</p>
<p>But that was 2018.</p>
<p>We took quite a hit for even,</p>
<p>oh, it was the largest to then software acquisition ever.</p>
<p>But it is the foundation, right?</p>
<p>Of what is our hybrid cloud play today</p>
<p>and doing very, very well.</p>
<p>So, but I had to take a short-term hit for that, right?</p>
<p>Short-term hit for a very large $34 billion acquisition.</p>
<p>But it was, for all of us, it was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>So I think when you get really centered on,</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s the right thing to do,</p>
<p>you just keep going, right?</p>
<p>So the team had the vision, they had the belief,</p>
<p>and everything else, the criticism doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t, we didn&rsquo;t always have exactly the right,</p>
<p>you know, this wasn&rsquo;t a straight arrow,</p>
<p>but stay down, you know you&rsquo;re right, keep going.</p>
<p>Okay, made a mistake, you know there&rsquo;s no bad mistake</p>
<p>as long as you learn from it, right?</p>
<p>And keep moving.</p>
<p>So yes, did it take longer,</p>
<p>but we are the largest that was there.</p>
<p>Could you maybe just, on a small tangent,</p>
<p>educate me a little bit?</p>
<p>So Red Hat originally is Linux,</p>
<p>open-source distribution of Linux,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also consulting, well, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>A little bit of consulting,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s mostly software distri, it&rsquo;s mostly Linux.</p>
<p>It was mostly software, yeah, absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p>So, but today IBM is very much, there&rsquo;s, you know.</p>
<p>Services.</p>
<p>IT services in the world is done by IBM.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many, so many varied,</p>
<p>so basically if you have issues,</p>
<p>problems to solve in, in business,</p>
<p>in the software space, IBM can help.</p>
<p>Yes, and so in, in that my last year,</p>
<p>our services business, we broke it into two pieces.</p>
<p>And one piece was spun off into a company called Kindrel,</p>
<p>which is managed outsourcing.</p>
<p>Keeping things running,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re off creating their own company.</p>
<p>What IBM then retained is really the part I built with PWCC,</p>
<p>the big consulting arm.</p>
<p>And so today, the IBM of today in 2023 is,</p>
<p>you know, at least ending 2022,</p>
<p>was 30% consulting, and the other 70% would be,</p>
<p>what would you consider software cloud AI?</p>
<p>So hybrid cloud and AI is the other,</p>
<p>and some hardware, obviously.</p>
<p>Still, the mainframe is modernized, alive, and kicking,</p>
<p>and still running some of the most important things</p>
<p>of every bank you can think of, practically.</p>
<p>And so that is the IBM of today,</p>
<p>versus perhaps, you know,</p>
<p>and Red Hat is a big piece</p>
<p>and an important part of that software portfolio.</p>
<p>And they had some services with them for implementation,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t a very, a very large part.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s grown by leaps and bounds, you know,</p>
<p>because originally the belief was everything</p>
<p>was going to go to the public cloud.</p>
<p>And at least many people thought that way.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t, in fact, we, I mean, we tried.</p>
<p>We procured a public cloud company.</p>
<p>We really tried to work it,</p>
<p>but what we found was a lot of the mission-critical work,</p>
<p>it was tuned for consumer world.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t tuned for the enterprise.</p>
<p>So then time is elapsing here, though,</p>
<p>and you gotta be upscale.</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t have any application.</p>
<p>Remember, we&rsquo;re not an application company.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t like we had an office.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have anything</p>
<p>that like pulled things out to the cloud.</p>
<p>And so as we looked for what our best,</p>
<p>what we really, back to who you are,</p>
<p>we really know mission-critical work.</p>
<p>We know where it lives today,</p>
<p>and we know how to make it live on the cloud,</p>
<p>which led us down hybrid cloud.</p>
<p>You know, that belief that the real world would turn into,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be things on traditional</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll, you&rsquo;ll never move,</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be private clouds for,</p>
<p>you know, have all the benefit of the cloud,</p>
<p>but they just don&rsquo;t have, you know, infinite expansion.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;ll be public clouds,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to have to connect them and be secure.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what took us down the path</p>
<p>with Red Hat, that belief.</p>
<p>The structure of that is fundamentally different</p>
<p>than something that&rsquo;s consumer-facing.</p>
<p>So the lesson you learn there</p>
<p>is you can&rsquo;t just reuse something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for consumers.</p>
<p>Very interesting point.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean consumer companies</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t move up into the enterprise,</p>
<p>because obviously they have, right?</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s very hard to take something</p>
<p>from the enterprise and come on down.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s got to be simple, consumable,</p>
<p>all the things we talked about already.</p>
<p>Plus you have to have the relationships</p>
<p>with the enterprise.</p>
<p>Yeah, very different.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you know our history, right?</p>
<p>At one time we had the PC business.</p>
<p>And, you know, the short answer</p>
<p>to why we would not do that</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s a consumer-facing business.</p>
<p>We were good at the enterprise.</p>
<p>And that consumer business, A, highly competitive,</p>
<p>got to be low cost, all the things</p>
<p>that are not the same muscles necessarily</p>
<p>of being in an innovation-driven, you know,</p>
<p>technology business.</p>
<p>Yeah, but what is now Lenovo, I guess,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s just been told.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, Lenovo acquired it.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re extremely good at that.</p>
<p>So, but not as good as you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>is at an enterprise.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s not, it was a-</p>
<p>Yeah, Lenovo&rsquo;s very good at their PC world, yes.</p>
<p>But I wouldn&rsquo;t, and they can sell</p>
<p>into the enterprise, right?</p>
<p>But you as a consumer can go buy a Lenovo too.</p>
<p>So look in China, right?</p>
<p>Look in other places.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I mean by a consumer,</p>
<p>you know, an end device.</p>
<p>And that was a big decision</p>
<p>because it would have been one of the last things</p>
<p>that had our logo on it that sits in your hands, right?</p>
<p>So when a new generation says,</p>
<p>well, what does IBM do, right?</p>
<p>Was that a difficult decision, do you remember?</p>
<p>This is a long time ago now, it&rsquo;s like 2005.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re all difficult</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not only things, it&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s back to knowing who you are</p>
<p>is how I would sum that up as, right?</p>
<p>And we were never great at making a lot of money at that.</p>
<p>And you can remember, originally it was IBM PC,</p>
<p>then there were IBM clones,</p>
<p>or they weren&rsquo;t called IBM clones back then</p>
<p>as the field became highly, highly competitive.</p>
<p>And as things commoditized,</p>
<p>we often, as they commoditized,</p>
<p>we would move them out</p>
<p>and move on to the next innovation level.</p>
<p>But because of that, it&rsquo;s not as public facing,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s one of the most recognizable logos ever.</p>
<p>Yeah, isn&rsquo;t it true?</p>
<p>That is very true.</p>
<p>That is actually a very important point.</p>
<p>And that is, you know, branding, as you say,</p>
<p>one of the most recognizable</p>
<p>and a very highly ranked brand strength around the world.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a trade-off.</p>
<p>I mean, I can&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>because there was a time you&rsquo;d have something</p>
<p>of IBM in your home, right?</p>
<p>Or a cash register, as an example.</p>
<p>Actually, they&rsquo;re still in places.</p>
<p>That went to Toshiba.</p>
<p>Can you speak to consulting a little bit?</p>
<p>What does that entail, to train up,</p>
<p>to hire a workforce that can be of service</p>
<p>to all kinds of different problems</p>
<p>in the software space, in the tech space?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s entailed in that?</p>
<p>I mean, you have to value a different set of things, right?</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;ve got to always stay ahead.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about hiring people who are willing to learn.</p>
<p>It is about, at the same time,</p>
<p>in my view, it&rsquo;s what really drives you</p>
<p>to be customer-centric.</p>
<p>Maybe you can educate me.</p>
<p>I think consulting is a kind of,</p>
<p>you roll in and you try to solve problems</p>
<p>that businesses have, like with expertise, right?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Is that the process of consulting?</p>
<p>Somewhat, right?</p>
<p>So there, okay, so fair enough.</p>
<p>When you say that we&rsquo;re consulting,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really broad spectrum.</p>
<p>I mean, I think people could be sitting here</p>
<p>thinking it does any, it could be,</p>
<p>I just give advice and I leave,</p>
<p>to all the way to I run your systems, right?</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s generally,</p>
<p>people use the word to cover everything in that space.</p>
<p>So we sort of fit in the spot,</p>
<p>which is we would come in and live at that intersection</p>
<p>of business and technology.</p>
<p>So yeah, we could give you recommendations</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;d implement them and see them through</p>
<p>because we had the technology</p>
<p>to go to the implementation and see them through.</p>
<p>And at the time back then, that&rsquo;s what,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;d been five of those that had failed,</p>
<p>that the companies had bought other consulting firms.</p>
<p>And so we were, okay, that was the great thing about,</p>
<p>I mean, the harrowing thing about it was,</p>
<p>here, please go work on this.</p>
<p>None of the others have ever succeeded before.</p>
<p>And yet on the other hand, the great promise was</p>
<p>you could really, clients were dying at that time</p>
<p>when we were doing that,</p>
<p>to get more value out of their technology</p>
<p>and have it really change the way the business worked.</p>
<p>So I think of it as how to improve business</p>
<p>and apply technology and see it all the way through.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we do today still.</p>
<p>Yeah, to see it all the way through, yes.</p>
<p>So let me say, it&rsquo;s almost like a personal question.</p>
<p>So that was a big thing you were a part of</p>
<p>that you led in 2002, that you championed and helped,</p>
<p>I should say, negotiate the purchase of Monday,</p>
<p>the consulting arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers</p>
<p>for $3.5 billion.</p>
<p>So what were some of the challenges of that</p>
<p>that you remember, personal and business?</p>
<p>At that time, PW really had to divest.</p>
<p>And so they were in peril of going to IPO, right?</p>
<p>So we sort of swept in at that point and said,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d been thinking about it a long time</p>
<p>and started to work on that as an acquisition.</p>
<p>So, you know, kind of balancing</p>
<p>which way would they go IPO or acquisition?</p>
<p>And so the challenges are obvious</p>
<p>and part of it&rsquo;s why they went with us as an acquisition.</p>
<p>Big difference to be a private firm than a public firm.</p>
<p>Very big.</p>
<p>I can remember one of the guys, you know,</p>
<p>he asked somebody how long you&rsquo;ve been with IBM</p>
<p>and the person answered 143 quarters.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s a little enlightening</p>
<p>about a business model, right?</p>
<p>So we had the challenges of being private versus public.</p>
<p>You have the challenge of when you acquire something</p>
<p>like that, as I say, you acquire hearts, not parts.</p>
<p>They could leave.</p>
<p>I mean, you could destroy your value by them leaving.</p>
<p>They can walk right out the door.</p>
<p>I mean, yes, you can put, you know,</p>
<p>lots of restraints, but still, that you have there.</p>
<p>And then we had to really build a new business model</p>
<p>that people and clients would, you know,</p>
<p>see as valuable and be willing to pay for.</p>
<p>And so we had to do something that lived</p>
<p>at that intersection and say that how this was unique</p>
<p>is what we were doing.</p>
<p>So you had the people aspect,</p>
<p>you had that they were gonna be private or public</p>
<p>and they had always been private their whole life.</p>
<p>And then you had the business model.</p>
<p>So, and the others had all failed that had tried to do this.</p>
<p>So yeah, it was a tough thing to do.</p>
<p>What about the personal side of that?</p>
<p>That was a big leap step up for you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been at IBM for a long time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is a big sort of leadership,</p>
<p>like very impactful, large-scale leadership decisions.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What was that like?</p>
<p>So, you know, unlike in my career earlier</p>
<p>where I said I was changing jobs,</p>
<p>I said I wasn&rsquo;t comfortable, et cetera.</p>
<p>So now here, fast forward 10 years and I&rsquo;m like, okay.</p>
<p>Honestly, how I felt inside, on one hand,</p>
<p>I did what I learned.</p>
<p>Inventory what you know how to do.</p>
<p>You have some good strengths that could work here.</p>
<p>The other part of me said, boy, this is really high profile.</p>
<p>And I felt, and I can remember saying to someone,</p>
<p>this is gonna kill me or catapult.</p>
<p>Probably nothing in between.</p>
<p>And that wasn&rsquo;t terrifying to you?</p>
<p>That was okay?</p>
<p>You were okay with that kind of pressure?</p>
<p>I was okay with that because I felt I knew enough.</p>
<p>Like these things I had,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll tell you the one thing I felt I knew the best.</p>
<p>Consultants of any, worth their weight,</p>
<p>they really do care that they deliver for an end client.</p>
<p>And I felt I understood service to a client so well</p>
<p>that what it meant to really provide value.</p>
<p>So I knew we would have like something that,</p>
<p>I knew the PwC people, more than anything,</p>
<p>wanted to deliver value to those clients they had</p>
<p>next to then developing their people.</p>
<p>That those were like the really two things.</p>
<p>And that I could.</p>
<p>And I also knew they felt they could do better</p>
<p>if they had more technology.</p>
<p>And we did.</p>
<p>So there really was a reason that I could really believe in.</p>
<p>So I authentically believed back to that point.</p>
<p>And I also felt I had built some of those skills</p>
<p>to be able to do that.</p>
<p>But I wouldn&rsquo;t call it terrifying,</p>
<p>but make no mistake, Lex, it was very hard.</p>
<p>And it turned out to be extremely successful.</p>
<p>By the time we ended, it was worth 19 and a half,</p>
<p>by the time I stepped, I ran it for,</p>
<p>oh goodness gracious, quite a long time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna say seven or eight, nine years.</p>
<p>And we were 19 and a half billion dollars.</p>
<p>It made 2.7 billion in profit.</p>
<p>It was very consequential to IBM.</p>
<p>But the fact that it was consequential is also very,</p>
<p>I mean, there was a time as we moved through it,</p>
<p>I can even remember it.</p>
<p>We just weren&rsquo;t meeting the goals as fast as we should.</p>
<p>And some of it was clients were like, oh, now you&rsquo;re IBM.</p>
<p>So, I mean, some things I knew would happen,</p>
<p>but they happened so much faster.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be things like clients would say,</p>
<p>oh, IBM cares about a quarter,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s negotiate every quarter on these prices.</p>
<p>And when they were private, they didn&rsquo;t have these issues.</p>
<p>Well, that had an impact on margins really fast.</p>
<p>And so that ability-</p>
<p>So you picked up a lot of challenges.</p>
<p>You pick them up right away.</p>
<p>And I thought, oh boy, I mean,</p>
<p>if I don&rsquo;t get this turned around, this is really a problem.</p>
<p>And the team learned a lot of lessons.</p>
<p>I mean, I learned people I had to move out</p>
<p>that I learned that when people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t believe they can do something,</p>
<p>they probably won&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>So we wanted to run the business at a certain level.</p>
<p>I really did have some great leaders,</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t really believe it could do that.</p>
<p>And I finally had to come to terms with,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t really believe in something,</p>
<p>you really aren&rsquo;t gonna probably make it happen</p>
<p>at the end of the day.</p>
<p>And so we would change that.</p>
<p>We would have to actually get some more help</p>
<p>to help us on doing so.</p>
<p>But then it turned.</p>
<p>And I can remember the day that we started</p>
<p>really getting the business to hum</p>
<p>and it was almost like, finally.</p>
<p>And I gave the team this little plaque,</p>
<p>this little kind of corny paperweight thing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna believe, I remember it was Thomas Edison.</p>
<p>And he said, many of life&rsquo;s greatest failures</p>
<p>are people who gave up right before</p>
<p>they were going to be successful.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so true.</p>
<p>I mean, there was also a governor of Texas who&rsquo;s passed,</p>
<p>but she had said, someone said,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the secret of your success?</p>
<p>And she said, it&rsquo;s passion and perseverance</p>
<p>when everyone else would have given up.</p>
<p>And I feel that&rsquo;s what that taught me.</p>
<p>That taught me like, no matter how bad this gets,</p>
<p>you are not giving up.</p>
<p>And this, now you can&rsquo;t keep doing the same thing</p>
<p>like the doctor, this hurts, oh, then stop doing it.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t keep doing the same thing.</p>
<p>We had to keep changing till we found our right way</p>
<p>to get the model to work right.</p>
<p>And client work, we never had an issue</p>
<p>and kept so many of the people.</p>
<p>And now we are 25 years almost later,</p>
<p>and a number of them run parts</p>
<p>of the IBM business still today.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s that old Maya Angelou saying,</p>
<p>when you say, what do I remember?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll say, you won&rsquo;t remember the specifics of this,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ll remember how you felt.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of how I feel.</p>
<p>And I think they do too, the whole team does of that.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ll get anniversary notes still on that,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;ve been through something like that</p>
<p>together with people.</p>
<p>So during the acquisition, the way you knew</p>
<p>that people, it&rsquo;s the right team,</p>
<p>are the ones that could believe that this consulting business</p>
<p>can grow, can integrate with IBM and all of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was lucky, look, I did things that helped that.</p>
<p>I mean, I knew that people joining us</p>
<p>would feel more comfortable if they had people leading it,</p>
<p>that they recognized, et cetera.</p>
<p>But again, I learned, those that didn&rsquo;t then,</p>
<p>I eventually had to take some action out.</p>
<p>But PWCC had a lot of really dedicated leaders to it,</p>
<p>and I give them a lot of credit.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s amazing to see a thing that kind of start</p>
<p>at that very stressful time,</p>
<p>and then it turns out to be a success.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just beautiful to see.</p>
<p>So what about the acquisition itself?</p>
<p>Is there something interesting to say about the,</p>
<p>like what you learned about maybe negotiation?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s a lot of money involved too.</p>
<p>To me, it was a win-win,</p>
<p>and we both actually cared that customers got value.</p>
<p>So there was this third thing that had a benefit.</p>
<p>Not them, not us, there was this third thing.</p>
<p>And then next to that.</p>
<p>I like how you think that people would have the wisdom</p>
<p>or what it takes to have great negotiation.</p>
<p>But yeah, so it&rsquo;s a win-win is one of the ways</p>
<p>you can have successful negotiations.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like obvious to even say that, right?</p>
<p>I mean, if you can, back to being in service of something,</p>
<p>we were both in service of clients.</p>
<p>So in and then, you know, I always say,</p>
<p>when you have a negotiation with someone,</p>
<p>okay, both parties always kind of walk away a little bit.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>If they both walk away going,</p>
<p>yeah, I should have got a little bit more.</p>
<p>Okay, but it&rsquo;s okay if I should have got.</p>
<p>Okay, they&rsquo;re both a little fussy.</p>
<p>When one walks away and thinks they did great</p>
<p>and the other one did horrible,</p>
<p>they usually is like born bad.</p>
<p>I mean, because they never worked that way.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve always felt that way with negotiations</p>
<p>that you push too far down,</p>
<p>you usually will be sorry you did that, you know?</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t push too far.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s ultimately what collaboration</p>
<p>and empathy means is you&rsquo;re interested</p>
<p>in the long-term success of everybody together</p>
<p>versus like your short-term success.</p>
<p>And then you get the discretionary energy from them</p>
<p>versus like, okay, you screwed me here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m done, right?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s even rewind even back.</p>
<p>Oh no, oh no.</p>
<p>Do you feel like this is a nostalgia interview?</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>Let me just ask the romantic question.</p>
<p>What did you love most about engineering?</p>
<p>Computer science, electrical engineering.</p>
<p>So in those early days,</p>
<p>from your degree to the early work.</p>
<p>I love that logic part of it, right?</p>
<p>And you do get a sense of completion at some point</p>
<p>when you reach certain milestones.</p>
<p>You know, like yes, it worked.</p>
<p>Or yes, you know, that finite answer to that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I loved about it.</p>
<p>I loved the problem-solving of it.</p>
<p>Computing, what led you down that path?</p>
<p>Computing in general, what made you fall in love</p>
<p>with computing, with engineering?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably that back to that desire</p>
<p>wanting to know how things work, right?</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s like a natural thing.</p>
<p>You know, math, I loved math for that reason.</p>
<p>I always wanted to study how did that, you know,</p>
<p>how did it get that to work kind of thing?</p>
<p>So it goes back in that time.</p>
<p>But I did start, when I started at Northwestern,</p>
<p>I was already in the engineering school.</p>
<p>But my first thought was to be a doctor.</p>
<p>That was far more noble, that I should be a medical doctor.</p>
<p>Until I could not pass human reproduction as a course.</p>
<p>And I thought the irony that I could not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I got all these colored pencils.</p>
<p>I got all these pictures.</p>
<p>This is not working out for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna stick to math.</p>
<p>That was the only course in my four-year college education</p>
<p>I had to take pass-fail.</p>
<p>Because otherwise I risked impairing my grade point average.</p>
<p>Engineering it is.</p>
<p>So, but after about 10 years,</p>
<p>you jumped from the technical role of systems engineer</p>
<p>to management, to a leadership role.</p>
<p>Did you miss at that time</p>
<p>the sort of the technical direct contribution</p>
<p>versus being a leader, a manager?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting point.</p>
<p>Like I said, I&rsquo;ve always been sort of a doer leader,</p>
<p>you know, so.</p>
<p>So you never lost that.</p>
<p>I never really did.</p>
<p>Even, you know, and I think this is like</p>
<p>really important for today.</p>
<p>The best way people learn is experientially, I think.</p>
<p>Now you may, that&rsquo;s being a generalization</p>
<p>because there are people can learn all different ways, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve done things like with my whole team.</p>
<p>They all had to learn how to build cloud applications.</p>
<p>We called it code off.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I don&rsquo;t care what your job is,</p>
<p>write code, you know?</p>
<p>And I remember when we were trying</p>
<p>to get the company to understand AI,</p>
<p>we did something called a cognitive jam.</p>
<p>Okay, there&rsquo;s a reason we picked the word cognitive,</p>
<p>by the way, instead of AI.</p>
<p>Today we use the word AI.</p>
<p>It was really symbolic.</p>
<p>It was to mean this is to help you think,</p>
<p>not replace your thinking.</p>
<p>There was so much in the zeitgeist</p>
<p>about AI being a bad thing at that time.</p>
<p>So that was why we picked a mouthful of a word</p>
<p>like cognitive.</p>
<p>And it was like, no, no, this is to help you actually.</p>
<p>So do what, you know, do what you do better</p>
<p>or do something you haven&rsquo;t yet learned.</p>
<p>We did something called the cognitive jam,</p>
<p>but the whole point was everybody in the company</p>
<p>could volunteer, get on a team.</p>
<p>You either had to build something</p>
<p>that improved one of our products</p>
<p>or did something for a client</p>
<p>or did a social, solved a social issue with AI.</p>
<p>And again, this goes back now 10 years.</p>
<p>And people did things from bullying applications</p>
<p>to, you know, railroad stuff to whatever it was.</p>
<p>But it got like 100,000 people to understand,</p>
<p>you know, viscerally, what is AI?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a long answer to my belief around experiential.</p>
<p>So do you ever give it up?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>Cause I actually think that&rsquo;s pretty good</p>
<p>to get your hands dirty in something.</p>
<p>You know, you can&rsquo;t do it, you know,</p>
<p>depending what you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>your effort to do that will be less, but.</p>
<p>So even a CEO, you try to get your hands dirty a little bit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve played, I mean, you still,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying I&rsquo;m any good at any of it anymore, but.</p>
<p>But to build up intuition.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s that really understand, right?</p>
<p>And not be afraid of.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like we mentioned at the beginning,</p>
<p>IBM research has helped catalyze</p>
<p>some of the biggest accomplishments</p>
<p>in computing and artificial intelligence history.</p>
<p>So D-Blue, IBM D-Blue versus Kasparov chess match</p>
<p>in 96 and 97.</p>
<p>Just to ask kind of like what your perception is,</p>
<p>what your memory is of it, what is that moment?</p>
<p>Like this seminal moment.</p>
<p>I believe probably one of the greatest moments</p>
<p>in AI history.</p>
<p>When the machine first beat a human</p>
<p>at a thing that humans thought.</p>
<p>You make a very interesting point,</p>
<p>because it is like one of the first demonstrations</p>
<p>of using a game to like bring something</p>
<p>to people&rsquo;s consciousness, right?</p>
<p>And to this day, people use games, right,</p>
<p>to demonstrate different things.</p>
<p>But at the time, it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t necessarily think of it so much as AI,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll tell you why.</p>
<p>I was, and I&rsquo;m not a chess player.</p>
<p>You might be a chess player, so I&rsquo;m not expert at it.</p>
<p>But I think I understand properly of chess</p>
<p>that chess has got a finite number of moves</p>
<p>that can be made.</p>
<p>Therefore, if it&rsquo;s finite, really what&rsquo;s a demonstration</p>
<p>of a supercomputing, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the amount of time and how fast</p>
<p>it can crunch through to find the right move.</p>
<p>So in some ways, I thought of it</p>
<p>as almost a bigger demonstration of that.</p>
<p>But it is absolutely, as you said,</p>
<p>it was a motivator, one of the big milestones of AI.</p>
<p>Because it put in your consciousness</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s man in this other machine, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing something.</p>
<p>So you saw it as just a challenging computation problem,</p>
<p>and this is a way to demonstrate hardware</p>
<p>and software computation at its best.</p>
<p>Yes, I did.</p>
<p>But the thing is, there is a romantic notion</p>
<p>that chess is the embodiment of human intellect,</p>
<p>I mean, intelligence, that you can&rsquo;t build a machine</p>
<p>that can beat a chess champion in chess.</p>
<p>And the fact that it did.</p>
<p>See, and I was blessed by not being a chess expert,</p>
<p>so it wasn&rsquo;t like college.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just a computation problem, I like it.</p>
<p>It was a computation problem to me.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s probably required to not be paralyzed</p>
<p>by the immensity of the task.</p>
<p>So that this is just solvable.</p>
<p>But it was a very, I think that was a powerful moment,</p>
<p>so speaking just as an AI person,</p>
<p>that reinvigorated the dream.</p>
<p>You were a little kid back then, though, right, at 95?</p>
<p>Or you have to be, like, were you,</p>
<p>do you remember it, actually, at the moment?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>What did you think at the moment about it?</p>
<p>It was awe-inspiring, because,</p>
<p>especially sort of growing up in the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>you think, especially of Garry Kasparov and chess,</p>
<p>like, your intuition is weak about those things.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see it as computation.</p>
<p>I thought of it as intelligence,</p>
<p>because chess, for a human being,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t feel like computation.</p>
<p>It feels like some complicated relationship</p>
<p>between memory and patterns and intuition</p>
<p>and guts and instinct and all of those, like, some-</p>
<p>You watch someone play,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you would conclude, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, and so to see a machine be able to beat a human,</p>
<p>I mean, you get a little bit of that with Chagy-Petey now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, language was to us humans</p>
<p>the thing that we kinda,</p>
<p>surely the poetry of language</p>
<p>is something only humans can really have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be very difficult</p>
<p>to replicate the magic of a natural language</p>
<p>without deeply understanding language.</p>
<p>But it seems like Chagy-Petey</p>
<p>can do some incredible things with language</p>
<p>in natural language dialogue.</p>
<p>But that was the first moment in AI.</p>
<p>Through all the AI winters from the 60s,</p>
<p>the promise of the-</p>
<p>It was, wow, this is possible</p>
<p>for a simple set of algorithms</p>
<p>to accomplish something that we think of as intelligence.</p>
<p>So that was truly inspiring,</p>
<p>that maybe intelligence,</p>
<p>maybe the human mind is just algorithms.</p>
<p>That was the thought at the time.</p>
<p>And of course, now, the funny thing,</p>
<p>what happens is the moment you accomplish it,</p>
<p>everyone says, oh, it&rsquo;s just brute force algorithms.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s silly.</p>
<p>And this continues.</p>
<p>Every single time you pass a benchmark,</p>
<p>a threshold to win a game,</p>
<p>people say, oh, well-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just this, it&rsquo;s just this.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s going to be a moment</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re going to have to contend with AI systems</p>
<p>that exhibit human-like emotions and feelings.</p>
<p>And you have to start to have some difficult discussions</p>
<p>about, well, how do we treat those beings?</p>
<p>And what role do they have in society?</p>
<p>What are the rules around that?</p>
<p>And this is really exciting</p>
<p>because that also puts a mirror to ourselves</p>
<p>to see, okay, what&rsquo;s the right way</p>
<p>to treat each other as human beings?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a good test for that.</p>
<p>It is, because I always say it&rsquo;s a reflection of humanity.</p>
<p>But I mean, it&rsquo;s taught by what man,</p>
<p>you know, bad stuff in the past,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll teach it bad stuff for the future.</p>
<p>Which is why I think, you know,</p>
<p>like efforts to regulate it are a fool&rsquo;s errand.</p>
<p>You need to regulate uses not, you know,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not the technology itself</p>
<p>is not inherently good or bad,</p>
<p>but how it&rsquo;s used or taught can be good or bad,</p>
<p>for sure, right?</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s, to me, will unveil now</p>
<p>a whole different way of having to look at technology.</p>
<p>Well, what about another magical leap</p>
<p>with the early days of Watson</p>
<p>with beating the Jeopardy challenge?</p>
<p>What was your experience like with Watson?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your vision for Watson in general?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it was really inspired by first chess, right,</p>
<p>and Kasparov, and then you come forward in time.</p>
<p>And, you know, I think what Watson did,</p>
<p>because you used a really important word,</p>
<p>AI had kind of waxed and waned in these winters, right?</p>
<p>In and out, in and out, popular or not,</p>
<p>more money, less money, you know, in and out,</p>
<p>confidence, no confidence.</p>
<p>And so I think that was one of the first times</p>
<p>it brought to the forefront of people like,</p>
<p>whoa, like it humanized it.</p>
<p>Because here it is playing against these two gentlemen,</p>
<p>and as you did lose at first, you know,</p>
<p>and then finally won at the end of the day.</p>
<p>And what it was doing is making you say,</p>
<p>hey, natural language,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually understanding natural language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the first demonstrations</p>
<p>of natural language support,</p>
<p>and a bit of reasoning over lots of data, right?</p>
<p>And so that it could have access to a lot of things,</p>
<p>come up with a conclusion on it.</p>
<p>And to me, that was a really big moment.</p>
<p>And I do think it brought to the conscious of the public,</p>
<p>and in good ways and bad,</p>
<p>because it probably set expectations very high,</p>
<p>of like, whoa, what this could be.</p>
<p>But, and I still do believe that it has got the ability</p>
<p>to change and help us, man, make better decisions.</p>
<p>That so many decisions are not optimal in this world.</p>
<p>You know, even medical decisions,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s right or wrong what took us down a path</p>
<p>of healthcare first with our AI.</p>
<p>And we took many pivots,</p>
<p>and I think there&rsquo;s a really valuable lesson</p>
<p>in what we learned.</p>
<p>One is that,</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t think the challenges are the technology.</p>
<p>Yes, those are challenges,</p>
<p>but the challenges are the people challenges around this,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Do people trust it?</p>
<p>How will they use it?</p>
<p>I mean, I saw that straight up with doctors and like,</p>
<p>meaning they&rsquo;re so busy</p>
<p>in the way they&rsquo;ve been taught to do something.</p>
<p>Do they really have time to learn another way?</p>
<p>I saw it was a mistake when you put it on top of processes</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t change, kind of like paving a cow path,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>I mean, it was all human change management around it</p>
<p>that were really its biggest challenges.</p>
<p>And another valuable lesson we picked back to usage,</p>
<p>if you think of IBM as moonshops,</p>
<p>we picked really hard problems to start with.</p>
<p>I think you see a lot of technology now starts</p>
<p>with really simple problems.</p>
<p>And by that, it probably starts to build trust</p>
<p>because I start little.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, I&rsquo;m not ready to outsource my diagnosis</p>
<p>to you, but I&rsquo;ll get some information here</p>
<p>about a test question.</p>
<p>So very different thinking.</p>
<p>So a lot of things to learn.</p>
<p>We were making a market at the time.</p>
<p>And when you make a market,</p>
<p>choice of problem you work on gets to be very important.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re catching up, well, then it&rsquo;s a scale game.</p>
<p>So very different thing.</p>
<p>And so, but Watson proved, I think,</p>
<p>I mean, I hope I&rsquo;m not being too,</p>
<p>I think Watson brought AI back out a winner for the world.</p>
<p>And that since then, there&rsquo;s just been,</p>
<p>one company after another and innovations</p>
<p>and people working on it.</p>
<p>And I have no regrets of anything that we did.</p>
<p>We learned so much.</p>
<p>I mean, we probably rebuilt it many times over.</p>
<p>It made it more modular.</p>
<p>And today to IBM, a Watson is more about AI</p>
<p>inside of a lot of things.</p>
<p>If you think of it that way,</p>
<p>which is more like an ingredient</p>
<p>versus it&rsquo;s a thing in and of itself.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;ll bring its real value.</p>
<p>You know, more as an ingredient and it&rsquo;s so badly needed.</p>
<p>And even back then the issue was so much data.</p>
<p>Like, what do you ever do it?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t get through it.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t use it for anything.</p>
<p>You know this well, it&rsquo;s your profession.</p>
<p>So we have to have it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s gonna propel it forward.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s part of the suite of tools that you use</p>
<p>when you go to enterprise and you try to solve problems.</p>
<p>AI for security, AI in automated operations,</p>
<p>AI in your robotics, AI on your factory floor.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all part of, and I think,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why even to this day,</p>
<p>thousands, I mean thousands and thousands of clients</p>
<p>of IBM still have the Watson components</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s the AI being used.</p>
<p>So it became a platform is how I would say it, right?</p>
<p>And an ingredient that went inside</p>
<p>and consultants, like you said, had to learn.</p>
<p>I had, they had to learn, don&rsquo;t just put it on something.</p>
<p>You gotta rethink how that thing should work</p>
<p>because with the AI, it could work entirely differently.</p>
<p>And so I also felt it could open up</p>
<p>and still will open up jobs to a lot of people</p>
<p>because more like an assistant</p>
<p>and it could help me be qualified to do something.</p>
<p>And we even years ago saw this with the French banks,</p>
<p>very unionized, but that idea that you could,</p>
<p>in this case, the unions voted for it</p>
<p>because it felt people did a better job.</p>
<p>And so, and that&rsquo;s just part about being really dedicated</p>
<p>to help it help humanity, not destroy it.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, a funny side note.</p>
<p>So Kubrick&rsquo;s 2001 Space Odyssey,</p>
<p>what do you think about the fact that Hal 9000</p>
<p>was named after IBM?</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t think it was.</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s, I really don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It could be more fake news.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more fake news.</p>
<p>I have done, I&rsquo;ve like researched this,</p>
<p>tried to find any evidence and people have talked to,</p>
<p>was it really one letter?</p>
<p>It was one letter off, right?</p>
<p>So people don&rsquo;t know H is one letter off of I,</p>
<p>A is one letter off of B, and then L is one letter off of M.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a solution found afterwards.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s what I think it more was.</p>
<p>I do think it&rsquo;s one of the early demonstrations of evil AI.</p>
<p>Like can be taught bad.</p>
<p>I could push back on that</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s presented as evil in the movie</p>
<p>because it hurts, the AI hurts people.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a really interesting ethical question</p>
<p>because the role of Hal 9000</p>
<p>is to carry out a successful mission.</p>
<p>And so the question that is a human question,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not an AI question, at what price?</p>
<p>Humans wage war.</p>
<p>They pay very heavy costs for a vision,</p>
<p>for a goal of a future that creates a better world.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the question certainly in space.</p>
<p>Doctors ask that question all the time.</p>
<p>I have limited resources,</p>
<p>who do I allocate my time and money and efforts?</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Like I said, I&rsquo;ve spent a decade</p>
<p>talking about this question of AI ethics, right?</p>
<p>And that it needs really considerable, not just attention,</p>
<p>because otherwise it will mirror everything we love</p>
<p>and everything we don&rsquo;t love.</p>
<p>And again, and that&rsquo;s the beauty in the eye of the beholder,</p>
<p>depending on your culture and everything else.</p>
<p>With what you&rsquo;re doing and what you&rsquo;re gonna do,</p>
<p>how do you think about it?</p>
<p>Do you think about the AI you&rsquo;re going to develop</p>
<p>as having guardrails dictated by some of your beliefs or?</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s so many interesting ways to do this</p>
<p>the right way, and I don&rsquo;t think anyone has an answer.</p>
<p>I tend to believe that transparency is really important.</p>
<p>So I think some aspect of your work should be open sourced,</p>
<p>or at least have an open source competitor</p>
<p>that creates kind of forcing function for transparency</p>
<p>of how you do things.</p>
<p>So the other is, I tend to believe,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s because of the podcast</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve just talked to a lot of people,</p>
<p>you should know the people involved.</p>
<p>I agree, a hundred percent.</p>
<p>As opposed to hide behind a company wall.</p>
<p>Sometimes there&rsquo;s a pressure, you have a PR team</p>
<p>and you have to care for investors and discussions,</p>
<p>so on, let&rsquo;s protect, let&rsquo;s surely not tweet,</p>
<p>like, and you form this bubble</p>
<p>where you have incredible engineers doing fascinating work</p>
<p>and also doing work that&rsquo;s difficult,</p>
<p>complex human questions being answered.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know about any of them as a society,</p>
<p>and so we can&rsquo;t really have that conversation.</p>
<p>Even though that conversation would be great for hiring,</p>
<p>it would be great for revealing the complexities</p>
<p>of what the company is facing,</p>
<p>so when the company makes mistakes,</p>
<p>you understand that it wasn&rsquo;t malevolence or half-assedness</p>
<p>and the decision-making is just a really hard problem.</p>
<p>And so I think transparency is just good for everybody.</p>
<p>And I mean, in general,</p>
<p>just having a lot of public conversations</p>
<p>about this is serious stuff,</p>
<p>that AI will have a transformative impact on our society</p>
<p>and it might do so very, very quickly</p>
<p>through all kinds of ways we&rsquo;re not expecting,</p>
<p>which is social media recommendation systems.</p>
<p>They, at scale, have impact on the way we think,</p>
<p>on the way we consume news,</p>
<p>and our growth, like the kind of stuff we consume</p>
<p>to grow and learn and become better human beings,</p>
<p>all of that, that&rsquo;s all AI.</p>
<p>And then, obviously, the tools that run companies</p>
<p>on which we depend, the infrastructure on which we depend,</p>
<p>we need to know all about those AI decisions.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not as simple as,</p>
<p>well, we don&rsquo;t want the AI to say</p>
<p>these specific set of bad things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s possible to-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Prevent evil or bad things</p>
<p>by creating a set of cold mathematical rules.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s all fuzzy and gray areas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all a giant mess.</p>
<p>It is, I mean, you think about it like a knife.</p>
<p>A knife can do good and a knife can do bad, okay?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s very hard.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t ban knives.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t ban knives.</p>
<p>And that, this is, I think back, it was probably 20,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, 15, 16,</p>
<p>we did principles of trust and transparency.</p>
<p>Notice the word transparency.</p>
<p>That belief that with AI, it should be explainable.</p>
<p>You should know who taught it.</p>
<p>You should know the data that went into training it.</p>
<p>You should know how it was written.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s being used, you have a right to know these things.</p>
<p>And I think those are pretty, to this day,</p>
<p>really powerful principles to be followed, right?</p>
<p>And part of it, we ended up writing,</p>
<p>because here we were,</p>
<p>when we were working on particularly healthcare,</p>
<p>like, okay, you care who trained it and what,</p>
<p>and where did, and that&rsquo;s sort of,</p>
<p>that comes to your mind and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>yeah, that makes a lot of sense</p>
<p>for something important like that.</p>
<p>But it just, in general,</p>
<p>people won&rsquo;t trust the technologies, I don&rsquo;t think,</p>
<p>unless they have transparency into those things.</p>
<p>In the end, they won&rsquo;t really trust it.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people would like to know,</p>
<p>sort of, because a lot of us,</p>
<p>I certainly do suffer from imposter syndrome,</p>
<p>that self-critical brain.</p>
<p>So, you know, taking that big step into leadership,</p>
<p>did you at times suffer from imposter syndrome?</p>
<p>Like, how did I get here?</p>
<p>Do I really belong here?</p>
<p>Or were you able to summon the courage</p>
<p>and sort of the confidence to really step up?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s very natural for someone.</p>
<p>Like, no matter, like, the bigger the job gets,</p>
<p>you turn and you look to the left and the right</p>
<p>and you see people around you and you think,</p>
<p>what am I doing here, right?</p>
<p>But then you remember what you do</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no one else doing it.</p>
<p>And so, you get that confidence.</p>
<p>So, I do hear a lot of people talk</p>
<p>about imposter syndrome, right?</p>
<p>And I kind of, actually, this past year,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent some time helping people on that topic.</p>
<p>And part of the stress, you have to believe</p>
<p>you have a right to be there like anyone else does</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve prepared for that moment, you know?</p>
<p>And so, it&rsquo;s a bit more of a,</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s hard to say it,</p>
<p>like a confidence thing more than anything else.</p>
<p>So, yes, there are times I look around,</p>
<p>but then I think, wow, I&rsquo;m in a position</p>
<p>to make something change.</p>
<p>So, I can&rsquo;t say I have ever really dwelled</p>
<p>on that feeling for long.</p>
<p>Okay, so you just focus on the work.</p>
<p>I have an opportunity, I&rsquo;m gonna step up.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s good or bad, I just focus on the work.</p>
<p>Yeah, good or bad, yeah.</p>
<p>One important lesson you said you learned from your mom</p>
<p>is never let anyone else define you.</p>
<p>Only you define who you are.</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s the trajectory, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>of your self-definition journey,</p>
<p>of you discovering who you are</p>
<p>from having that very difficult upbringing?</p>
<p>You know, they say pivotal moments happen</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t realize it when they&rsquo;re happening.</p>
<p>So, most of my, I feel like most of my self-discovery,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been like something happens in a year or two</p>
<p>or some number later, I look back on it and say,</p>
<p>you know, I learned this from that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like not in the moment always with me.</p>
<p>That could just be how I am.</p>
<p>So, I feel like it&rsquo;s been,</p>
<p>know yourself, it&rsquo;s a good thing, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually heard you say that on different podcasts</p>
<p>when you ask people questions.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, well, it depends, you know,</p>
<p>like know yourself a bit, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know who you are, though.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things, like you said,</p>
<p>like for me, there&rsquo;s moods when you&rsquo;re super self-critical,</p>
<p>sometimes you&rsquo;re super confident,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s many, sometimes you&rsquo;re emotional,</p>
<p>sometimes you&rsquo;re cool under pressure,</p>
<p>and all those are the same human being.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Self-awareness, that&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>Was there societal expectations and norms</p>
<p>regarding gender that you felt in your career?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve spoken to that a little bit,</p>
<p>but was there some aspect of that</p>
<p>that was constraining, empowering, or both?</p>
<p>You know, I chose to never look at it, okay?</p>
<p>Now, whether that is right or wrong,</p>
<p>and again, I&rsquo;m a product of the 70s,</p>
<p>and 70s and the 80s, where I think I was surrounded,</p>
<p>all the other women around me,</p>
<p>viewed our way to get ahead was just to work hard.</p>
<p>Work hard, work hard,</p>
<p>and that was the way you differentiated yourself.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s obvious, it did help.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no doubt about it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re always, you know, you learned a lot of things,</p>
<p>which qualified opened up another door,</p>
<p>opened up another door.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very remindful that I have worked for companies</p>
<p>that are very steeped in those values of equal opportunity.</p>
<p>And so nothing remarkable about that.</p>
<p>And I mean, when I was a wee kid,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taught hire a diverse team.</p>
<p>I get evaluated for it.</p>
<p>I get evaluated if my team has built up their skills.</p>
<p>So this is, you know, when you&rsquo;re really formative,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a culture that that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s valuing, right?</p>
<p>So it becomes part of you.</p>
<p>So I say sometimes to chagrin,</p>
<p>did I ever feel I was held back for that reason?</p>
<p>Now, were there plenty of times when,</p>
<p>you know, I write about a few of the stories in the book,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m laying cables at night and the guys are at the bar.</p>
<p>Now, I didn&rsquo;t really wanna go with them to the bar anyways.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d be like, we&rsquo;ll be back to get you, you know, bye.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, okay.</p>
<p>I mean, I learned a lot, so it didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Now, all that said,</p>
<p>back to my earlier story about being a role model,</p>
<p>you know, it would be foolish to not believe</p>
<p>that there were times that that mattered.</p>
<p>And I would say two things, even not that long ago,</p>
<p>you know, a colleague called me</p>
<p>and I was talking about media and about women CEOs</p>
<p>and said, do you notice that sometimes</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s a woman CEO, they call the person by name.</p>
<p>And when it&rsquo;s a man, they call the company out,</p>
<p>not the person&rsquo;s name exactly associated with the issue.</p>
<p>And I said, yeah, well, I think you have to just understand</p>
<p>much of what you do, it will be magnified</p>
<p>because there are so few of you.</p>
<p>And sometimes it will be, you know,</p>
<p>really can be blown out of proportion, right?</p>
<p>And so that can happen and you get to learn in which way.</p>
<p>Now, all that said, on gender,</p>
<p>it is an interesting thing with the book</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;ve talked to, you know, having a book,</p>
<p>even some of my best friends, the first reaction is,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait for my daughter to read it.</p>
<p>I say, well, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Do you think you could read it?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting reaction.</p>
<p>And here I am 40 years later,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an interesting reaction, right?</p>
<p>And I say, no, the book,</p>
<p>I really worked hard to write it for everyone.</p>
<p>I just happened to be a woman, right?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s still that there.</p>
<p>And so look, until I think people see</p>
<p>and never feel that they have a,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t even matter whether there&rsquo;s a woman,</p>
<p>could be another diverse group that feels it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay to ask those questions.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why actually I&rsquo;m okay talking about it</p>
<p>because there were times I felt it, right?</p>
<p>There were times in my life on my looks or my weight</p>
<p>or my clothing or endless numbers of things</p>
<p>that people would comment on</p>
<p>that they would not have commented on</p>
<p>if it was someone else.</p>
<p>Now, on the other hand, when there&rsquo;s so few of you</p>
<p>and you know, there&rsquo;s good and bad.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s benefit to that too, right?</p>
<p>If you do good work, it&rsquo;s easier to be recognized.</p>
<p>And so a pro and a con,</p>
<p>and I think I&rsquo;ve just grown up believing</p>
<p>like my advice to young women going to engineering,</p>
<p>not because you&rsquo;re gonna be an engineer.</p>
<p>It teaches you to solve problems</p>
<p>and anything you job you do is gonna be solving problems.</p>
<p>Things like that are what I take away from that</p>
<p>in that journey.</p>
<p>It is interesting that I hear from women</p>
<p>that even on this podcast,</p>
<p>when I talk to incredible women like yourself,</p>
<p>it is inspiring to young women to hear.</p>
<p>I mean, you like to see,</p>
<p>you talk to somebody from Turkey</p>
<p>and then Turkish people all get excited.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so true.</p>
<p>So you get like somebody that looks like you,</p>
<p>somebody that, and the category could be tiny</p>
<p>or it can be huge.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the reality of the world.</p>
<p>It is the reality of the world.</p>
<p>And the work I do now to put this group called 110,</p>
<p>put 1 million black employees into the middle class</p>
<p>without college degrees,</p>
<p>get them the right skills, upwardly mobile jobs.</p>
<p>So one of my last years we had been working on,</p>
<p>it just did regular leadership session at IBM</p>
<p>and had our black colleagues.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about what did it feel like</p>
<p>to be a black leader?</p>
<p>And here, these are extremely accomplished people.</p>
<p>And I can remember very well when telling a story about,</p>
<p>look, I felt if I failed or succeeded, it&rsquo;s not just me.</p>
<p>It came from a country in Africa.</p>
<p>I feel like the whole country is on my shoulder,</p>
<p>my success or failure.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a burden.</p>
<p>I mean, like, I don&rsquo;t feel that burden.</p>
<p>Not true.</p>
<p>As a woman CEO, I did feel like,</p>
<p>even the headlines when I was named said,</p>
<p>her appointment will either, her success or failure</p>
<p>will be a statement for the whole gender kind of thing.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t dwell on it, but I meant that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>but I could see how people, like you said,</p>
<p>it could be a small group, could be whatever.</p>
<p>And so that is a lot of pressure on people</p>
<p>and they need role models.</p>
<p>You are a role model for people.</p>
<p>Look at what you&rsquo;re able to do.</p>
<p>You do these podcasts,</p>
<p>you understand your science very well.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very well prepared.</p>
<p>Your ability to translate it to people,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not an insignificant thing.</p>
<p>And you may think, oh, is that about the power of me?</p>
<p>Not really, right?</p>
<p>And you obviously believe,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t do this because</p>
<p>you just like sitting at a microphone.</p>
<p>You do it because you think, okay,</p>
<p>if I can get people to say things</p>
<p>that are really valuable to other people,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna learn something.</p>
<p>I assume that is, I mean, you ever told me</p>
<p>my interpretation is that&rsquo;s why you do this podcast,</p>
<p>that you feel like in service of other people</p>
<p>that you can bring them something unique</p>
<p>by the way you do this.</p>
<p>Now, I should ask you, why do you do it?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my impression.</p>
<p>By the way, can I just comment on the fact</p>
<p>that you keep asking me really hard questions?</p>
<p>I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a neuromedicine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really honored by it.</p>
<p>As a fan of a podcast myself,</p>
<p>what I hope is to talk to people like you</p>
<p>and to show that you are a fascinating</p>
<p>and beautiful human being</p>
<p>outside of your actual accomplishments also.</p>
<p>So sometimes people are very focused</p>
<p>on very specific things about, like you said, science,</p>
<p>like what the actual work is,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s nuclear fusion or it&rsquo;s GIGPT.</p>
<p>I just wanna show that it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>because I see it at MIT and everywhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just human beings trying their best.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re flawed, but just realizing</p>
<p>that all of these very well-accomplished people</p>
<p>are all the same.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a very good, well said.</p>
<p>So then regular people and young people,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re able to see, I can do this too.</p>
<p>I can have a very big impact.</p>
<p>No imposter syndrome, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re all kind of imposters.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all trying to figure it out.</p>
<p>To a certain degree.</p>
<p>To a certain degree.</p>
<p>So let me just ask you about family.</p>
<p>You wrote that my family still jokes</p>
<p>that the reason I never had children on my own</p>
<p>was because I had already raised my family.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>So this is talking to your upbringing.</p>
<p>But in general, what was your,</p>
<p>you know, leading a giant company,</p>
<p>what was the right place to find a work-life balance for you</p>
<p>to have time for family,</p>
<p>have time for away from work and be successful?</p>
<p>So I had to learn that.</p>
<p>And I might&rsquo;ve said, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the only one that can determine</p>
<p>your own work-life balance.</p>
<p>Companies are innate things.</p>
<p>I mean, they will take everything they can from you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not a bad thing.</p>
<p>They just will, as will bosses.</p>
<p>I mean, you give it, they&rsquo;ll take it.</p>
<p>And when people ask for, you know, I need a roof,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay.</p>
<p>I had to come with terms with the criminal was me</p>
<p>if I needed that balance.</p>
<p>I had to set those boundaries.</p>
<p>And so when I comment about a family,</p>
<p>because I am in extreme awe of people with children</p>
<p>who work, it is a extremely hard thing to do.</p>
<p>I watch my siblings.</p>
<p>I love my nieces and nephews.</p>
<p>And whew, you know, A, the emotional,</p>
<p>their pain is your pain every minute of the day.</p>
<p>And then you still have a job on top of it.</p>
<p>And so when my mom had to go back to school</p>
<p>and had to work, I was the one.</p>
<p>And so when she couldn&rsquo;t go to the teacher meeting,</p>
<p>I went to the teacher meeting.</p>
<p>And so in some ways, and there&rsquo;s an age gap</p>
<p>between my brother and I and my other two sisters.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m still, they still call me mama bear even.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m extremely protective of all of them.</p>
<p>And it is as if I had raised them</p>
<p>and my mom did a great job raising them.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t, but I was there.</p>
<p>And so when it came time to have children,</p>
<p>and my husband came from a family where his father died</p>
<p>and was raised by a single mother,</p>
<p>very similar endpoint, different reasons why he ended up,</p>
<p>you know, his father did not abandon them.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want people to believe to do my job,</p>
<p>you can have no children.</p>
<p>That is not right.</p>
<p>I know other great women CEOs,</p>
<p>Marilyn Houston, who ran Lockheed Martin,</p>
<p>extremely technical company,</p>
<p>Mary Barra, who runs General Motors,</p>
<p>Ellen Coleman, who run DuPont.</p>
<p>These are all my friends to this day.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve been fantastic mothers</p>
<p>and husbands, good parents, right?</p>
<p>And so I talk about it because it was a choice we made.</p>
<p>And so, you know, we both felt, look,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d reached a point where for his reasons,</p>
<p>what he had to do, I&rsquo;d already felt that way.</p>
<p>And that we were comfortable</p>
<p>just being great aunts and uncles.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a great aunt, you know?</p>
<p>Well, I like to think that for my little guys</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re older now, but lots of them.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no doubt though, the choices we made,</p>
<p>Mark and I, that that made it easier</p>
<p>for me to focus on work.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just math, you know,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;ve got less people to have to take care of.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m very considerate of that.</p>
<p>And I think much of it informed many of the policies</p>
<p>I put into because I had such great empathy</p>
<p>for those who then still had these other responsibilities.</p>
<p>And I desperately wanted them all to stay in the workforce.</p>
<p>So I can remember, and my siblings have been</p>
<p>more successful than I, by the way,</p>
<p>I mean, to my mother&rsquo;s credit.</p>
<p>And my one sister who, you know, went to Northwestern,</p>
<p>has an MBA, built some of the most sophisticated systems.</p>
<p>She spent her whole career at Accenture</p>
<p>and just recently retired as a chief executive</p>
<p>of all of consulting.</p>
<p>But at one point she took off time</p>
<p>to spend with her family.</p>
<p>And then went to go back to work.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s talking to me and she&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I should go back to work.</p>
<p>You know, maybe life&rsquo;s path, you know,</p>
<p>technology goes so fast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a few years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sitting there like, what are you talking about?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you know, look at her credentials.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re far outstanding.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, and I thought to myself, like, ding,</p>
<p>one of those moments, if my own sister feels that way</p>
<p>with all her credentials,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet I went back to work the next day</p>
<p>and I said, hey, pull for me,</p>
<p>all the people who&rsquo;ve left for parental reasons</p>
<p>or whatever, family reasons, didn&rsquo;t come back.</p>
<p>And it began a program of returnships.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t tell you how many,</p>
<p>in men and women,</p>
<p>was because they didn&rsquo;t feel confident to come back.</p>
<p>They thought technology passed them by.</p>
<p>Okay, we said, it&rsquo;s three months.</p>
<p>You could stay one month, three months, doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Well, a lot of people, like one day,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, you&rsquo;re right, not that much happened.</p>
<p>It happened, but I caught up.</p>
<p>I actually know more than I think, you know?</p>
<p>And I, so it was a long answer to your question about,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t, but I am so empathetic.</p>
<p>And I am in awe of what they are able to do.</p>
<p>So, and it made me then, I think,</p>
<p>more empathetic to the policies and the like</p>
<p>around that topic,</p>
<p>so you could keep great people in the workforce.</p>
<p>So you mentioned your friends with Mary Barra,</p>
<p>the CEO of GM.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t mean to name drop.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t, I didn&rsquo;t mean it that way.</p>
<p>No, I love her.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>So I just wanted to, I&rsquo;m just curious.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell Mary she should do your podcast.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll make it happen.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a great leader.</p>
<p>I always, I tell Mary what I think of her</p>
<p>is I think she&rsquo;s one of the most authentic leaders</p>
<p>out there, most authentic.</p>
<p>I mean, just very different companies, huge challenges.</p>
<p>I worked there first, I remember, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m very, you know, in some ways I&rsquo;m very beholden,</p>
<p>right, you know, I&rsquo;m very appreciative of what they did.</p>
<p>I mean, Mary and I are circa the same,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m a bit older, so, but circa that genre.</p>
<p>Do you exchange wisdoms?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>When you do anything hard,</p>
<p>it takes time and perseverance, like we talked about.</p>
<p>And you can get that,</p>
<p>where do you get the fuel for it?</p>
<p>You can either get it from your attitude</p>
<p>or you can get it from your network or your relationships.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a firm believer relationships are from what you give</p>
<p>not what you get, meaning you give, trust me,</p>
<p>they will come back at the time they need to come back to you</p>
<p>at these moments in life.</p>
<p>If you focus on how can I bring Lex value?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be a day I need Lex and he will be back.</p>
<p>And so to those women,</p>
<p>to me, relationships are not transactional.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a proof that to this day,</p>
<p>even though I&rsquo;m no longer still active as a CEO,</p>
<p>these are all still my friends.</p>
<p>And we are friends, all of us.</p>
<p>And I can remember some of them</p>
<p>when I first became a CEO calling me and saying,</p>
<p>hey, it&rsquo;s a little lonely here, so let me talk to you.</p>
<p>And then when they became, I did the same for them.</p>
<p>And then they remember and they do for the next generation.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a very supportive,</p>
<p>almost to a T, any of the women you could name</p>
<p>who have been CEOs, I would say,</p>
<p>almost to a T, have all been very supportive.</p>
<p>In fact, a number of us work on a little,</p>
<p>another non-for-profit right now called Journey,</p>
<p>which some women who had started</p>
<p>the Fortune&rsquo;s Most Powerful Women had started,</p>
<p>which was, could we get more women,</p>
<p>particularly diverse women, but women in general,</p>
<p>to more quickly be into positions of leadership and power.</p>
<p>And so many of the women you named and more,</p>
<p>we all dedicate time mentoring</p>
<p>and kind of creating this little group of fellows</p>
<p>every year to do this.</p>
<p>Friendship and love is core to this whole thing,</p>
<p>not just the success, but just the whole human condition.</p>
<p>Let me ask one last question, advice for young people.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve had a difficult upbringing, a difficult life,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve become one of the most successful</p>
<p>human beings in history.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to young people,</p>
<p>or just people in general who are struggling a bit,</p>
<p>trying to figure out how they can have a career</p>
<p>they can be proud of, or maybe a life they can be proud of?</p>
<p>I feel like a life you can be proud of</p>
<p>is just one if you leave something a little bit better.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be big, you know?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a life well-lived, right?</p>
<p>It was Churchill who said,</p>
<p>you might remember it better than I.</p>
<p>You make a living by what you get,</p>
<p>and you live a life by what you give,</p>
<p>something to that effect.</p>
<p>But my advice would probably, when I&rsquo;m asked this,</p>
<p>I would tell them to ask more questions than give answers.</p>
<p>Just focus on being a sponge.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s funny, I asked my husband the same question</p>
<p>the other day, I said, hey, we&rsquo;re talking to somebody,</p>
<p>and people were asking this,</p>
<p>and he sort of paused for a while,</p>
<p>and he said, I&rsquo;d tell them, patience.</p>
<p>I said, what do you mean?</p>
<p>And he said, I see so many young people,</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re in such a hurry to somewhere,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where, and that if they just had patience</p>
<p>and let life unfold, I think they may be surprised</p>
<p>where they ended up.</p>
<p>And actually, I think that&rsquo;s a really good answer,</p>
<p>to be honest.</p>
<p>Along the way, keep asking questions,</p>
<p>keep that childlike curiosity.</p>
<p>I know, it sounds so easy to say, it&rsquo;s just so, you know.</p>
<p>Yeah, like you said, the obvious things,</p>
<p>I think they tend to be the most profound.</p>
<p>Jeanne, you&rsquo;re an incredible human being,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re an inspiration to so many.</p>
<p>Thank you for helping run and contribute</p>
<p>to one of the great companies</p>
<p>that brings so much good power to the world,</p>
<p>and thank you for putting in the hard work</p>
<p>of putting it all in the great book.</p>
<p>And thank you for talking today, this was a huge honor.</p>
<p>Thank you for doing it.</p>
<p>You did a lovely job.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>

<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Eleanor Roosevelt.</p>
<p>Do what you feel in your heart to be right,</p>
<p>for you&rsquo;ll be criticized either way.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening.</p>
