Berg show live from the</p><p>nation&rsquo;s capital it&rsquo;s time to get</p><p>healthy lose weight and feel great call</p><p>now to speak with dr. Berg at eight six</p><p>six five six one four two nine two and</p><p>now dr. Eric Berg</p><p>hey guys welcome back it&rsquo;s Friday</p><p>morning Eastern Standard Time in</p><p>Northern Virginia and I&rsquo;m here to take</p><p>your calls they have a lot of colors</p><p>already and waiting for like a half hour</p><p>so let&rsquo;s just get right into it and</p><p>again try to keep your questions to one</p><p>question because there&rsquo;s so many people</p><p>that want to call in and by the way if</p><p>you want to call in the number is 866</p><p>five six one four to nine - Kaelyn</p><p>you&rsquo;re from Atlanta go ahead you two</p><p>question hey dr. Burke thank you very</p><p>much I&rsquo;m very big a simple question what</p><p>are fasting or intermittent fasting</p><p>thank you so much for the simple</p><p>questions I like those okay so let&rsquo;s</p><p>just talk about that there&rsquo;s a lot of</p><p>research on fasting there&rsquo;s not a lot as</p><p>much research on intermittent fasting so</p><p>that being said here&rsquo;s my opinion on it</p><p>I think in order to do a water fasting</p><p>you know you&rsquo;re you have to work up to</p><p>it</p><p>because it&rsquo;s such a shock to the body</p><p>sometimes people can&rsquo;t handle it they go</p><p>into a hypoglycemic reaction where they</p><p>have blood sugar problems so if you&rsquo;re</p><p>doing a water fast and versus</p><p>intermittent fasting I would use a</p><p>couple indicators to know if this is</p><p>right for you</p><p>one is if you have extreme hunger and</p><p>you have blood sugar problems like</p><p>dizziness feeling cold lightheadedness</p><p>brain fog and any of these other</p><p>symptoms other than just a little bit of</p><p>hunger then I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re ready</p><p>for it I think you should start with</p><p>intermittent fasting intermittent</p><p>fasting is kind of like a gradient</p><p>approach you can start like just by</p><p>doing three meals a day then you could</p><p>switch to two meals a day then you could</p><p>switch to two meals for a four hour</p><p>period and fast for 20 hours and but you</p><p>got to work up to it so again my whole</p><p>view point is I think it&rsquo;s good if you</p><p>can do it but I&rsquo;m recommending in a</p><p>minute fasting for the majority of the</p><p>people because you get your nutrients</p><p>it&rsquo;s easier to go into you get lots of</p><p>benefits again we don&rsquo;t know a hundred</p><p>percent</p><p>all of the benefits but we know it&rsquo;s</p><p>like it protects the brain</p><p>it helps cardiovascular lowers</p><p>cholesterol it helps the heart</p><p>it helps memory and helps reverse</p><p>insulin resistance other than that it</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t do anything but those are the</p><p>points so good question hey Jessica</p><p>you are on the air from New Jersey go</p><p>ahead you two question Thank You dr.</p><p>Berg it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;ve been a tremendous help</p><p>to me and such a pleasure to speak with</p><p>you let me get right to it I just wanted</p><p>you to know that I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;ve been on a</p><p>Whole Foods diet for nine years I&rsquo;ve</p><p>been really working on my health it&rsquo;s</p><p>come back from all better issues I&rsquo;ve</p><p>kept my gallbladder my liver and</p><p>adrenals have been affected but um</p><p>you&rsquo;ve helped me lose about 25 pounds in</p><p>six weeks just by bringing me to the</p><p>realization of insulin resistance I just</p><p>never knew that so my issue right now is</p><p>I&rsquo;ve come back from a lot of it like a</p><p>allergy issues and just having problems</p><p>digestion in general so right now I love</p><p>nuts I&rsquo;ve come to the point where I can</p><p>actually eat them again I&rsquo;m severely</p><p>allergic was but now that I&rsquo;m eating</p><p>them more often of course I&rsquo;m developing</p><p>more issues with them and I&rsquo;m have such</p><p>a hard time a digestive meats only thing</p><p>I see MS Riley digest well is raw salmon</p><p>and I just was wondering if you could</p><p>suggest anything else as far as higher</p><p>fat foods that I could try or or maybe a</p><p>product that you would have that would</p><p>help me digest fats and proteins better</p><p>yeah well it sounds like Jessica that it</p><p>may be a simple problem you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re</p><p>doing everything good but now we still</p><p>have this allergy issue have a hard time</p><p>digesting meats which is an indication</p><p>there&rsquo;s one thing that kind of pops out</p><p>when you said that the common</p><p>denominator is a pH allergies almost I</p><p>mean it can&rsquo;t even exist in the body if</p><p>your pH is correct people develop</p><p>allergies when the pH become becomes</p><p>excessively alkaline in the blood okay</p><p>excessively it&rsquo;s normally should be</p><p>Auckland but excessively alkaline you</p><p>start developing allergies so the</p><p>biggest tip that I would give you is I</p><p>would drop your pH in your stomach since</p><p>that&rsquo;s like the only primary acid ever</p><p>all the other acids are secondary so</p><p>that means that if you took</p><p>cleric acid in the form of 1800 chloride</p><p>or upsetted vinegar I I do have</p><p>something called outside of vinegar plus</p><p>which has betaine hydrochloride and</p><p>opposite of vinegar in a pill form but</p><p>as a intermediate thing you can start</p><p>adding more apple cider vinegar in the</p><p>water table spoon with with water drink</p><p>that before the meals because if we can</p><p>drop the pH and you may need to also</p><p>adds an acidifier to the point where all</p><p>of a sudden now you&rsquo;re digesting</p><p>proteins then we know your allergies are</p><p>going to get a lot better</p><p>because it&rsquo;s the undigested proteins</p><p>that then go through the the body</p><p>mistakenly and you start developing</p><p>allergies that&rsquo;s how you get an allergy</p><p>so we want to drop the pH make you more</p><p>acidic and that will actually help you</p><p>it also will help release bile because</p><p>it in order to release bile you need a</p><p>pH between 1 & 3 which is very acidic</p><p>and thereby releasing the bile so you</p><p>may not have to take bile salts but if</p><p>you just drop that pH it should kill two</p><p>birds with one stone the ability to</p><p>digest fats digests proteins and reduce</p><p>allergies so anything you can do to</p><p>acidify the body will help allergies</p><p>there&rsquo;s one more thing if you if you</p><p>have seasonal allergies or you can also</p><p>certify the body with something called</p><p>ammonium chloride so you can write that</p><p>down it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not toxic or it&rsquo;s kind of</p><p>a gnat it could be kind of a safe thing</p><p>to take it&rsquo;s called ammonium chloride</p><p>but that&rsquo;s in a natural acidifier and</p><p>then I also the other said if I would be</p><p>like phosphorus as a supplement but</p><p>stick with the up the betaine</p><p>hydrochloride right now on the upside of</p><p>integrating could be fine Hey Nydia</p><p>you&rsquo;re on the air you&rsquo;re from Florida go</p><p>ahead you had a question yes sir my</p><p>question is that because I had breast</p><p>cancer I stopped having any sugar and</p><p>therefore I&rsquo;m very soon now so I&rsquo;ve</p><p>listed your fats on recipe and I&rsquo;ve been</p><p>eating it and adding a lot of milk fats</p><p>into my diet and now I&rsquo;m concerned about</p><p>my liver if it&rsquo;s not going to affect my</p><p>liver and</p><p>so what you&rsquo;re saying is that you&rsquo;re a</p><p>little concern about adding this fat and</p><p>destruction the liver is that the</p><p>question right okay good let&rsquo;s talk</p><p>about that and I&rsquo;m creating a whole</p><p>series of videos on this because people</p><p>are fat phobia I mean they&rsquo;re like what</p><p>happened like and then I guess 50s 60s</p><p>and 70s there&rsquo;s been this transition</p><p>against fat fats the bad guy and 80s</p><p>everything all the big food companies</p><p>went low-fat and low fat doesn&rsquo;t taste</p><p>good so they replaced they added more</p><p>sugar</p><p>next next knack will cookies Alison has</p><p>low fat high carbs right so everyone</p><p>started getting fat fat has gotten a bad</p><p>rap because it you know people associate</p><p>well if I have fat then if I eat fat</p><p>that&rsquo;s going to create a problem there&rsquo;s</p><p>a couple pointers on that if we take</p><p>cholesterol for example you got LDLs</p><p>it&rsquo;s so called bad cholesterol right</p><p>it&rsquo;s not even cholesterol</p><p>it&rsquo;s low-density lipoproteins it&rsquo;s a</p><p>protein that carries cholesterol through</p><p>the body and there&rsquo;s two types of LDL</p><p>and I&rsquo;m going to create a video on this</p><p>so you can really get it but this is the</p><p>thumbnail sketch you have one LDL that</p><p>is not a problem at all it&rsquo;s very fluffy</p><p>it&rsquo;s very big and it kind of floats it</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t go into the lining of the</p><p>arteries to clog it and then there is a</p><p>bad higher density type LDL which goes</p><p>into the lining and starts causing or</p><p>plaquing when you get your cholesterol</p><p>tested they don&rsquo;t separate those two out</p><p>it&rsquo;s just one LDL so how do you know if</p><p>if even if it&rsquo;s high if it&rsquo;s bad or good</p><p>you have to look at your triglycerides</p><p>okay triglycerides those are blood fats</p><p>if the triglycerides are high and and</p><p>you have high LDL then that&rsquo;s a problem</p><p>but here&rsquo;s the interesting information</p><p>when you want to lose one of the LDLs</p><p>that&rsquo;s okay the big one the fluff you</p><p>want</p><p>when you eat fat that will increase that</p><p>okay LDL the one that doesn&rsquo;t cause</p><p>destruction the bad cholesterol the LDL</p><p>the bad one which is the high-density</p><p>one is only increase through</p><p>carbohydrates refined carbohydrates so</p><p>basically it&rsquo;s kind of a technical</p><p>answer to this eating fat is not going</p><p>to in any shape of form destroy your</p><p>liver or create a problem unless you&rsquo;re</p><p>doing carbs at the same time okay so as</p><p>long as you cut the carbs out there&rsquo;s</p><p>not going to be a problem with saturated</p><p>fats and I know there&rsquo;s a lot of them</p><p>you know</p><p>vegans too that are going to say oh my</p><p>gosh no no it&rsquo;s all the fats really bad</p><p>but I&rsquo;m going to I&rsquo;m going to put a</p><p>series of videos out that will give you</p><p>the the other viewpoint the other side I</p><p>consume a tremendous amount of fat like</p><p>my breakfast which right now I think</p><p>it&rsquo;s ten nine ten I didn&rsquo;t have</p><p>breakfast I&rsquo;m going to probably have a</p><p>breakfast at eleven but I&rsquo;m going to do</p><p>four eggs I&rsquo;m gonna do a lot of cheese</p><p>I&rsquo;m going to do no sugar high quality</p><p>bacon and I&rsquo;ve been doing that for a</p><p>long long time and I put a lot of people</p><p>on it and actually improves their</p><p>cholesterol so I guess that&rsquo;s a long</p><p>answer to no it&rsquo;s not going to be a</p><p>problem it&rsquo;s not going to harm the liver</p><p>what it&rsquo;s going to harm your liver is</p><p>there carbs but you looks like you got</p><p>that out of the diet so you&rsquo;re going to</p><p>be totally fine Achim you&rsquo;re on the air</p><p>San Diego</p><p>go ahead hi dr. Budd thank you for</p><p>taking my call I have two quick question</p><p>for you my first one is I have a problem</p><p>with like pee grinding I grind my pee a</p><p>lot at night is there something I can do</p><p>about it and my second question is I&rsquo;m</p><p>about your incident support and um I</p><p>know it stays take with meal since I&rsquo;m</p><p>doing intermittent fasting and I only</p><p>eat once a day so can I take it you know</p><p>without food like in the morning because</p><p>I want to take it more than just one</p><p>peel at night because um that&rsquo;s when the</p><p>time I&rsquo;m eating very very good like any</p><p>okay so let&rsquo;s answer the first question</p><p>grinding a bruxism that&rsquo;s really a</p><p>vitamin b1 deficiency so you just need</p><p>more b1 I would take</p><p>nutritional yeast maybe a teaspoon of</p><p>that and the part the hard part about</p><p>the nutritional yeast is trying to</p><p>figure out how to consume it because of</p><p>the powder I mean what I do is I just</p><p>take the teaspoon and put it in my mouth</p><p>and try to it gets all sticky and</p><p>eventually kind of gets out of my teeth</p><p>but anyway that would give you the b12</p><p>handle that symptom on a rare case you</p><p>might need specifically just be one but</p><p>make sure it&rsquo;s a natural version okay so</p><p>that should handle that the insulin</p><p>support formula that she&rsquo;s talking about</p><p>is mainly to help dysfunctional insulin</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t have to be taken with food at</p><p>all you can have an empty stomach you</p><p>can even take all of at the same time</p><p>it&rsquo;s not going to be a problem okay all</p><p>right so hey Laurie you are on the air</p><p>you&rsquo;re from Rhode Island go ahead hi</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been suffering with some for about</p><p>15 months with stiff and painful knees</p><p>had an x-ray at the orthopedic it&rsquo;s fine</p><p>as they said everything looks normal but</p><p>your massage tool it really helped but</p><p>it didn&rsquo;t fix it all the way some</p><p>noticing a lot of your videos you&rsquo;re</p><p>talking about too much calcium and</p><p>taking apple cider vinegar so I&rsquo;m</p><p>wondering first question is could joint</p><p>pain knee pain be due to too much</p><p>calcium and if you say yes is there</p><p>anything else plus to do with the apple</p><p>cider vinegar and then the other thing</p><p>is these cherry hemangiomas I&rsquo;m getting</p><p>them on my skin and a lot of spot and a</p><p>lot of places and I&rsquo;m wondering if what</p><p>what what&rsquo;s what is that cause I read</p><p>once a long time ago it was related to</p><p>liver but that&rsquo;s all it said in this</p><p>certain book that it&rsquo;s related to liver</p><p>and I don&rsquo;t know if you agree with that</p><p>or you could tell me how to stop um work</p><p>yeah I think where they come from you&rsquo;re</p><p>talking about that condition we have</p><p>these little spider veins that are kind</p><p>of coming out in little bit different</p><p>spots right no they&rsquo;re like they&rsquo;re like</p><p>little red circular and they rise up</p><p>they rate their rays they get bigger and</p><p>bigger right but the tiny little red</p><p>things right yeah yeah so question Lorie</p><p>have you done the like the eating plan</p><p>that I suggested with low carbs and</p><p>ketogenic and fasting have you tried</p><p>that yet yes yes I&rsquo;m doing that and that</p><p>is helping okay all right good so let&rsquo;s</p><p>just talk about that for a second so oh</p><p>let me ask question are you taking</p><p>calcium right now no I stopped taking it</p><p>because I I was taking the one you said</p><p>not to okay yeah so if you&rsquo;ve had a</p><p>history of taking calcium carbonate</p><p>which people don&rsquo;t realize is like</p><p>eating a rock chewing on cement</p><p>I don&rsquo;t even recommend taking calcium</p><p>unless you have bone loss osteopenia or</p><p>cramps in the calf I mean you could take</p><p>some occasionally but don&rsquo;t get in a</p><p>habit of taking a lot of it because the</p><p>calcium is it&rsquo;s much better to get it in</p><p>a food source with some high-quality</p><p>cheese I&rsquo;m from Wisconsin so of course</p><p>I&rsquo;m going to plug that but the the thing</p><p>is that if you have stiffness in the</p><p>knee that tells us that either you&rsquo;re</p><p>lacking vitamin k2 that has a purpose of</p><p>driving the calcium out of the joints</p><p>and the arteries so that&rsquo;s one thing k2</p><p>or your pH needs to be more acidic so</p><p>yes so I would recommend to the upside</p><p>of vinegar to drop the pH to allow</p><p>calcium to be mobilized when your pH is</p><p>not correct when your blood pH is</p><p>slightly too alkaline you get allergies</p><p>but you also get calcium in the soft</p><p>tissue on the eyes as cataracts on the</p><p>teeth is tartar on the joints as</p><p>arthritis bursitis tendinitis on the</p><p>kidney is kidney stones so what you can</p><p>do is drop the pH there&rsquo;s a couple</p><p>things that you can do to drop the pH</p><p>you can take betaine hydrochloride</p><p>outside of vinegar another one that</p><p>works really good for stiff hands and</p><p>stiff knees is ammonium chloride that&rsquo;s</p><p>an acidifier they use that back I think</p><p>in the 40s in in some of the arthritis</p><p>medications</p><p>they used as a as kind of a extra I</p><p>think a extra product that was like</p><p>inert or a binder</p><p>it&rsquo;s called ammonium chloride in some of</p><p>these medications but when they took it</p><p>out the medication stopped working and</p><p>they realized wow you can actually help</p><p>arthritis stiffness with ammonium</p><p>chloride I think you could get it maybe</p><p>online find somewhere where you can find</p><p>it that&rsquo;s a good acidifier it just drops</p><p>the pH and it&rsquo;s pretty safe and then you</p><p>can also do fast food or phosphorous</p><p>liquid standard process has a good</p><p>faster than liquid these are all this</p><p>things that you you could try but again</p><p>it&rsquo;s one of those things where I don&rsquo;t</p><p>know exactly I just know we need to drop</p><p>your pH and we need to add the k2 and</p><p>there&rsquo;s several ways to do it okay so</p><p>and also well as you drop insulin over</p><p>time and you&rsquo;re stopped taking the wrong</p><p>kind of calcium you should improve over</p><p>time</p><p>okay so Arlene go ahead you&rsquo;re on the</p><p>air you&rsquo;re from Delaware how are you</p><p>today great how are you um I&rsquo;m okay I</p><p>have a couple questions for you one is</p><p>I&rsquo;m on the ketogenic diet and I&rsquo;ve been</p><p>getting like a like a twitch feeling and</p><p>maybe even a jittery feeling throughout</p><p>my whole body and I was wondering if</p><p>that is that one of the side effects and</p><p>also I wanted to know about what is the</p><p>maximum of carbs I should have to lose</p><p>weight and you had also suggested that</p><p>when I talked to you last week you said</p><p>for a white tongue that kefir is good</p><p>for it but I&rsquo;ve been looking at the</p><p>kefir and on the grocery stores and they</p><p>have like 12 carbs so is that high fat</p><p>low carb is that good for that for that</p><p>program very good question okay so let&rsquo;s</p><p>just kind of go through it first</p><p>question is the twitch and the jittery</p><p>feeling it sounds like you need to need</p><p>more electrolytes as you do the</p><p>ketogenic diet you drop sugar there boy</p><p>you&rsquo;re going to lose water weight and</p><p>you&rsquo;re going to</p><p>is electrolyzed specially potassium so</p><p>you can put that back in you need a good</p><p>electrolyte powder to do that so that&rsquo;s</p><p>one thing and then also the other thing</p><p>if you have especially like the keto flu</p><p>you might need the B vitamins so</p><p>nutritional yeast so electrolytes and</p><p>nutritional yeast are essential when you</p><p>do when you start getting into this</p><p>situation because people just need more</p><p>that should handle that and sometimes</p><p>you need sodium a little more salt so</p><p>again it could need a combination the</p><p>maximum carbs you want is 50 grams per</p><p>day I&rsquo;m going to recommend that you</p><p>don&rsquo;t worry about vegetable</p><p>carbohydrates okay</p><p>the lower the carb you do if you get</p><p>down to 20 the faster the weight loss</p><p>okay if you have a ruined metabolism you</p><p>need to stick with 20 but don&rsquo;t worry</p><p>about the vegetable carbohydrates the</p><p>white tongue is a completely separate</p><p>problem and yes</p><p>Kiefer does have some sugar so it&rsquo;s</p><p>almost like it&rsquo;s kind of conflicting so</p><p>you may want to just do a little bit of</p><p>kefir make sure it&rsquo;s a I like the</p><p>grass-fed plain not little fat the whole</p><p>fat so just have a little bit and that</p><p>should over time improve that situation</p><p>and of course there&rsquo;s other things you</p><p>can do probiotics but I think that</p><p>should that should be enough all right</p><p>good question alright so Patricia you&rsquo;re</p><p>on the line you have a question you&rsquo;re</p><p>in the Bronx New York yes yes hi dr.</p><p>Berg um I wanted to thank you for all</p><p>your videos and say hello to Karen</p><p>because I love her too and I have a</p><p>question regarding dietary guidelines</p><p>that I should follow I have my a one C</p><p>last a1c was six point six I&rsquo;m not on</p><p>any medication but I&rsquo;d like to get it</p><p>into non-diabetic range I also have golf</p><p>stones so I want to be able to find out</p><p>what sort of ratios and the macros that</p><p>I should be eating that&rsquo;s going to get</p><p>me into that sort of ketosis that will</p><p>lower my insulin levels would also not</p><p>be so high fat that I&rsquo;m having a</p><p>gallstone problem okay good so the first</p><p>question is a 1 C is 6.6 so it sounds</p><p>like you&rsquo;re doing you&rsquo;re doing the right</p><p>thing it probably came down we want to</p><p>get it down to the low fives a1c is an</p><p>average of blood sugars for three months</p><p>so it&rsquo;s a really good indicator of if</p><p>you are a diabetic or not okay so you&rsquo;re</p><p>on the right program for that I would</p><p>suggest supporting even more with</p><p>certain nutrients you may want to try a</p><p>product I have called insulin and</p><p>glucose support which kind of supports</p><p>insulin excess and blood sugars and it</p><p>has 10 different nutrients in it that</p><p>will also help you a lot but as you</p><p>actually fix insulin the gall stones</p><p>will improve because high insulin will</p><p>cause gall stones the other thing is</p><p>like to dissolve gall stones there&rsquo;s a</p><p>product I have called gall bladder</p><p>formula which has bile salts in it as</p><p>you do a ketogenic diet obviously it</p><p>requires more fat so some people have</p><p>been bile deficient so that&rsquo;s why they</p><p>have stones so we might have to add</p><p>actual bile salts it&rsquo;s called gall</p><p>bladder formula to start dissolving</p><p>those stones to keep the gall bladder</p><p>clean however there&rsquo;s one more thing I</p><p>think is the most important thing to</p><p>focus on this in a minute fasting in a</p><p>minute of fasting and I just released a</p><p>video on that will cause the gall</p><p>bladder to rest between meals thereby</p><p>concentrating bile thereby resolving the</p><p>stone and that will really help you</p><p>because you have kit you have kids on a</p><p>diet and you have intermittent fasting</p><p>two different separate things or not</p><p>they&rsquo;re not the same so people actually</p><p>think that unit minute fasting is part</p><p>of a ketogenic diet it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s</p><p>something that I&rsquo;m recommending to add</p><p>on top of everything which you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re</p><p>doing this meal planning and then you&rsquo;re</p><p>not eating and you&rsquo;re eating back and</p><p>forth so that&rsquo;s one thing the other</p><p>thing is to stimulate bile you have to</p><p>add fat to the diet if you&rsquo;re going to</p><p>low-fat diet you could end up with gall</p><p>stones because you&rsquo;re not producing a</p><p>file so it all has to do with bile watch</p><p>some more videos on the bile but I think</p><p>that will give you a head start</p><p>okay Patricia alright so Danielle you&rsquo;re</p><p>from Brooklyn as well go ahead you&rsquo;re on</p><p>the air yes yes yes another New Yorker</p><p>thanks for taking my call I really</p><p>appreciate it</p><p>my question has to do with weight gain</p><p>due to the cortisone or - cortisone</p><p>shots so let me just give you a little</p><p>background first</p><p>up until three years ago I never had an</p><p>issue with weight gain of 118 pounds</p><p>five five feet four inches or pretty</p><p>petite then I got to cortisone shots and</p><p>after the second one I gained ten pounds</p><p>I have belly fat now I have fat on my</p><p>arms which I never had before and I&rsquo;m</p><p>consistently gaining weight and I can&rsquo;t</p><p>lose it for the life of me and I don&rsquo;t</p><p>know what to do</p><p>what I did do was try the giving up</p><p>snacks in between meals because I also</p><p>had bloating thanks to you and that</p><p>resolved the bloating but it didn&rsquo;t get</p><p>rid of any of the fat now what I also</p><p>discovered is that I have five fatty</p><p>liver highest cholesterol I&rsquo;ve got low</p><p>energy you know just walking up a flight</p><p>of stairs I&rsquo;m exhausted after that so I</p><p>don&rsquo;t know what the issue is is it</p><p>insulin resistance is it divert issues</p><p>like what is going on with my body I</p><p>never had any problems before okay you</p><p>know it&rsquo;s a similar thing happened to me</p><p>I was doing fine well I wasn&rsquo;t doing</p><p>fine what kicked me is that cortisone</p><p>shot back when I was late 20s I&rsquo;d poison</p><p>ivy and these cortisone and then I got</p><p>it again in his cortisone and all this</p><p>and every Uros doing cortisone for five</p><p>years in a row that is some nasty stuff</p><p>cortisone is adrenal hormone and so when</p><p>you take it it actually shuts down your</p><p>adrenals and we can see adrenals so you</p><p>are an adrenal fatigue issue so that&rsquo;s</p><p>that&rsquo;s probably what&rsquo;s going on the</p><p>adrenals are kind of inactivated in</p><p>there now now they&rsquo;re not working like</p><p>they should and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to</p><p>then cause a rebound effect to add more</p><p>cortisol and that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s why</p><p>you&rsquo;re getting more fat so here&rsquo;s what</p><p>you need to do you need to support the</p><p>adrenal gland and have a lot of data</p><p>videos on that</p><p>a lot of nutritional things for that you</p><p>can research that on your own but as far</p><p>as eating goes you definitely need to do</p><p>the ketogenic diet you need to do get a</p><p>minute of fasting follow it to a tee</p><p>because that will start to fix the fatty</p><p>liver keep the vegetables high to keep</p><p>the fat coming through the liver and so</p><p>that will take the pressure off the</p><p>adrenals too because you&rsquo;ll be dropping</p><p>insulin when you drop insulin you drop</p><p>stress to the adrenals it doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>increase stress it decreases stress the</p><p>other thing is that to repair the damage</p><p>from cortisone shots you need to get a</p><p>high quality thing called colostrum get</p><p>into powder get the good stuff</p><p>it&rsquo;s a little bit pricey you take before</p><p>bed start off with a half a teaspoon in</p><p>some water drink it and then gradually</p><p>go up to a teaspoon and a heaping</p><p>teaspoon why because apparently that is</p><p>a lot of properties to repair damage</p><p>from cortisone it helps the gut it helps</p><p>the liver and you would take that helps</p><p>the immune system you would take it over</p><p>a period of probably six months I&rsquo;ve</p><p>seen credible success with that I&rsquo;ve</p><p>taken it before so that&rsquo;s really what</p><p>you need to do sorted renals continue to</p><p>support the insulin resistance through</p><p>the diet and then add the colostrum all</p><p>right great</p><p>hey George you&rsquo;re on the air from</p><p>Toronto go ahead hey doctor how are ya</p><p>thanks for doing the live show this is</p><p>great sure so first of all I actually</p><p>came up with a couple other questions</p><p>but my first question is in regards to</p><p>the fat intake I know you talked a lot</p><p>about calories but what I don&rsquo;t know is</p><p>the total amount of grams for fat and</p><p>protein maximum or minimum per day so I</p><p>was wondering if you could shed some</p><p>light on that okay and then I had</p><p>another couple questions just in regards</p><p>to the keto you know how when you first</p><p>do a keto you use a lot of weight but</p><p>when you do second or third attempts at</p><p>it your body doesn&rsquo;t adapt and I just</p><p>wanted to find out you know am I still</p><p>going to be okay if I just keep to it</p><p>you know what there&rsquo;s just some more</p><p>information on why the</p><p>while it does that and what I need to be</p><p>doing okay so question George do you do</p><p>ketogenic you lose some weight and then</p><p>you go off the program I get it years</p><p>ago okay so yeah but this time around</p><p>now I just started actually on Sunday I</p><p>saw I found your side you online and I</p><p>and I started doing it again and it&rsquo;s</p><p>just not coming off estas as it was yeah</p><p>so I just wanted to get some information</p><p>on that but I&rsquo;m afraid that I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m</p><p>worried about the grams because I&rsquo;m not</p><p>sure how many grams of fat and protein I</p><p>need per day okay I&rsquo;m good another</p><p>question on that is calories per day I&rsquo;m</p><p>not sure how many I actually need to</p><p>have yeah okay alright George so let&rsquo;s</p><p>just talk about that in general I have a</p><p>video on that it&rsquo;s really a variable</p><p>thing I can&rsquo;t not even knowing your size</p><p>your shape your bone density or high I</p><p>can&rsquo;t tell you how many grams and</p><p>calories exactly but but here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s</p><p>the rule of thumb that is the fat grams</p><p>is the wild variable that can go from</p><p>very small to very high if you take an</p><p>athlete they need to seriously do some</p><p>mass amount of fat to be able to to</p><p>function you take someone sedentary they</p><p>can&rsquo;t do very much so I always like to</p><p>start off by not adding fat to the diet</p><p>just consume your normal food in a whole</p><p>fat form</p><p>don&rsquo;t go low fat proteins like even if</p><p>you&rsquo;re going to have hamburger do the</p><p>fattiest kind you have don&rsquo;t go lean</p><p>okay so so you&rsquo;re just not adding the</p><p>coconut you&rsquo;re not adding the oil and</p><p>that type of thing so you&rsquo;re just going</p><p>through like that and then you can start</p><p>to play around by adding a little bit</p><p>more like a keto bomb but here&rsquo;s the</p><p>thing George if your metabolism is very</p><p>slow which it sounds like it is and you</p><p>start adding a certain amount of grams</p><p>like too much it is you&rsquo;re just going to</p><p>burn the poquito bomb the dietary fat</p><p>but not your own fat a much more</p><p>important principle would be to do the</p><p>in a minute fasting with the ketogenic</p><p>and so you can start healing your</p><p>metabolism through healing insulin and</p><p>then you&rsquo;ll be able to tolerate more fat</p><p>but</p><p>that&rsquo;s a kind of a question that is it&rsquo;s</p><p>really hard to do on the air because I</p><p>don&rsquo;t even know what you look like I</p><p>don&rsquo;t of your size but it sounds like</p><p>you&rsquo;re going to be the kind of case that</p><p>you you&rsquo;re not going to be able to do a</p><p>lot of fat right off the bat and you</p><p>just want to play around as far as</p><p>calories the same thing I would shoot</p><p>for not worrying about calories but</p><p>going based on satisfying your body with</p><p>the recommend recommended eating plan</p><p>that I recommend and then do three meals</p><p>no snacks and then go to two meals no</p><p>snacks because that way even though</p><p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re really satisfied you&rsquo;re</p><p>going without calories between the meal</p><p>longer and longer longer longer that</p><p>alone will allow you to heal metabolism</p><p>and speed up your metabolism that but</p><p>that&rsquo;s my answer I&rsquo;m sticking to it</p><p>hey listen guys I&rsquo;m going to take a</p><p>quick little commercial break right here</p><p>and I just wanted a last time minute a</p><p>flash sale there&rsquo;s a whole bunch people</p><p>who didn&rsquo;t get in on that so they said</p><p>can you do it one more time I will do it</p><p>one more time so this flash sale is</p><p>basically for my new products you can go</p><p>to Amazon I put some links down below of</p><p>five products and there&rsquo;s 25% off for</p><p>one hour between 9:30 now and 10:30</p><p>Eastern Standard Time today tomorrow and</p><p>the next day so I&rsquo;ll just really kind of</p><p>quickly just give you summarize of what</p><p>these flash sales are so this is raw</p><p>wheatgrass juice powder it&rsquo;s lemon this</p><p>is awesome stuff because it&rsquo;s not a</p><p>grass powder it&rsquo;s a wheatgrass juice</p><p>powder or organic completely raw nothing</p><p>heated over 106 degrees grown on an</p><p>ancient seabed so it has the trace</p><p>minerals one teaspoon is equivalent to</p><p>about a tray of wheatgrass so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p><p>like 50 cents per teaspoon so you&rsquo;re</p><p>getting this tray wheatgrass so I take</p><p>it on my fasting period of time I mix</p><p>with water drink it down I put kamut in</p><p>there which is an ancient grain which</p><p>actually adds more selenium and so it&rsquo;ll</p><p>definitely increase your energy and it</p><p>tastes good I put some</p><p>I&rsquo;m in no sugar in there stevia this is</p><p>an awesome one that&rsquo;s on Amazon this one</p><p>joint pain relief formula I basically</p><p>created this for myself because I have a</p><p>lot of old injuries and what&rsquo;s in here</p><p>is not just the standard glucosamine and</p><p>MSM and all that but it has adrenal</p><p>extracts because the adrenal gland is</p><p>one of the most powerful anti</p><p>inflammatory glands that because it</p><p>produces hormones</p><p>it also has actual collagen that&rsquo;s</p><p>called Tendo guard which actually</p><p>supports and regenerates tendons and</p><p>ligaments okay</p><p>and it has some of the other most</p><p>powerful anti-inflammatory so I take</p><p>this for myself and I created it so if</p><p>you have any inflammation that would be</p><p>a good thing this one estrogen balance</p><p>getting a lot of good feedback this for</p><p>estrogen dominance for women hot flashes</p><p>cysts act like cystic acne hot flashes</p><p>just too much estrogen and menopausal</p><p>it&rsquo;s great for men it will help raise</p><p>testosterone because it lowers estrogen</p><p>it&rsquo;s a natural form of a concentrated</p><p>cruciferous called dim di M and with a</p><p>lot of other cool things okay so that&rsquo;s</p><p>that&rsquo;s that insulin and glucose support</p><p>some some person just called I just</p><p>mentioned that this is 10 different</p><p>powerful nutrients to support insulin</p><p>directly it&rsquo;s good for insulin</p><p>resistance but mainly weight loss not</p><p>directly but indirectly by supporting</p><p>insulin you can take this with meals</p><p>without meals but this will help the a</p><p>ones help balance a one C blood sugars</p><p>so it gives you the edge and you know we</p><p>talked about high levels of cortisol and</p><p>insulin but what about cortisol and</p><p>estrogen but what about insulin so this</p><p>is the one that handles the insulin</p><p>which is probably one of the most big</p><p>dominating hormones that are creating</p><p>all sorts of problems with everyone and</p><p>then lastly the hair formula this has a</p><p>combination of nutrients trace minerals</p><p>natural B vitamins biotin silica and it</p><p>also has a protein that builds the hair</p><p>with one other additional thing</p><p>decreases something called DHT which is</p><p>a powerful form of testosterone that can</p><p>lead to alopecia so it handles a lot of</p><p>different causes of hair problems but</p><p>getting a lot of good feedback on this</p><p>so if you have any hair problems you</p><p>might want to try it so again this is a</p><p>flat cell it&rsquo;s only for an hour and I&rsquo;m</p><p>doing this in exchange for an unbiased</p><p>review so if you wouldn&rsquo;t mind on Amazon</p><p>give me a review when you feel like</p><p>you&rsquo;ve got some feedback and so yeah so</p><p>thank you very much for that commercial</p><p>let&rsquo;s get back to the next caller and</p><p>Tamara you&rsquo;re on the air you&rsquo;re from</p><p>Houston go ahead hi dr. woogie hi hi I</p><p>mean I&rsquo;ve been doing a keto diet since</p><p>last Wednesday and I am getting really</p><p>discouraged because I am craving sugar I</p><p>mean I want to rip into a chocolate and</p><p>it is just really I&rsquo;m really feeling</p><p>defeated because I&rsquo;m crazy sugar well</p><p>I&rsquo;m glad that you can I mean up or sugar</p><p>but you know I&rsquo;ve been living on this</p><p>all my life and I&rsquo;m 39 years old and I</p><p>just I&rsquo;m really disturbed well I&rsquo;m glad</p><p>you called because now we can dissect</p><p>why you&rsquo;re craving sugar so can I ask</p><p>you a couple quick questions yes when</p><p>did you start it I started last</p><p>Wednesday okay last Wednesday so we know</p><p>right there you&rsquo;re not adapted yet so</p><p>that&rsquo;s one thing so can you tell me</p><p>roughly in like fastest time possible</p><p>like what you eat in a given day okay</p><p>this I probably eat some eggs with olive</p><p>oil and some bacon and then from lunch I</p><p>might eat um some ground beef with</p><p>cabbage with mushrooms and bell peppers</p><p>and onions and for dinner I might eat</p><p>some steak with broccoli and sauce sauce</p><p>i saute onions and mushrooms and salt I</p><p>use Himalayan pink salt and some cumin</p><p>powder and oregano seasoning okay and</p><p>basically tell me</p><p>what time you have breakfast I&rsquo;m sorry</p><p>what time do you eat breakfast in</p><p>morning um I eat breakfast this morning</p><p>about 6:30 okay are you hungry that</p><p>early in the morning ah not really okay</p><p>really okay and then next question when</p><p>you crave is it in the later part of the</p><p>day or after a meal or when it&rsquo;s after a</p><p>meal okay all right so there&rsquo;s a couple</p><p>things that you can do number one the</p><p>first thing you want to do since all</p><p>night long you fasted you&rsquo;re breaking</p><p>the fast by the breakfast when you&rsquo;re</p><p>not even hungry I would not eat</p><p>breakfast until you are hungry go as</p><p>long as possible and you want to keep</p><p>doing that until you can go in for hours</p><p>after you wake up then you eat your</p><p>first meal why is that because every</p><p>time you eat you spike insulin and then</p><p>now it&rsquo;s going to create low blood sugar</p><p>now you&rsquo;re going to be craving okay the</p><p>other thing is that I would recommend</p><p>going to my channel and make what&rsquo;s</p><p>called the keto bomb there are little</p><p>cookies there&rsquo;s different kinds and use</p><p>that as your substitute you freeze them</p><p>they&rsquo;re delicious I mean these chocolate</p><p>cookies like it&rsquo;s almost like you&rsquo;re</p><p>eating sugar but you&rsquo;re doing xylitol so</p><p>that&rsquo;s one thing you want to have but</p><p>have those after the meal that you&rsquo;re</p><p>craving the sweets okay now if you</p><p>started this less Wednesday you lived on</p><p>your sugar whole life it&rsquo;s going to take</p><p>honestly probably a couple more weeks</p><p>before you can really get into this</p><p>adaptation but in the meantime we want</p><p>to get rid of cravings and so that&rsquo;s</p><p>what I want you to do add a little more</p><p>potassium you might want to get that as</p><p>a supplement I have my electrolyte</p><p>powder but I won&rsquo;t get that in until the</p><p>end of next week because I ran out but</p><p>so that&rsquo;s one thing and then the last</p><p>thing has increased more actual salads</p><p>and I think you&rsquo;ll just hang in there</p><p>it&rsquo;s going to happen so those are the</p><p>things I would do and then once the</p><p>cravings go away that means that your</p><p>cells have adapted completely now they</p><p>can run in fat don&rsquo;t give up</p><p>okay so just keep going</p><p>so LV you&rsquo;re from Utah go ahead you&rsquo;re</p><p>on the air</p><p>yeah hi dr. Burge I am loving your</p><p>videos and loving your program since be</p><p>on your program two months ago or</p><p>starting two months ago then I&rsquo;m down 23</p><p>pounds and I can&rsquo;t wait to send in my</p><p>before and after pictures to you when</p><p>I&rsquo;m all done um and I want to say hello</p><p>to Karen as well we love her okay and</p><p>the question I have for you is about</p><p>intermittent fasting so there&rsquo;s three</p><p>things I&rsquo;m wondering if I&rsquo;m breaking my</p><p>fast with so the first thing is juice</p><p>from a whole lemon in the morning the</p><p>second scene is kombucha and the third</p><p>scene is a magnesium its natural calm</p><p>magnesium supplement before I go to bed</p><p>tonight or excuse me at night every</p><p>night and I was just wondering if those</p><p>three themes might be breaking like that</p><p>okay great so know the lemon juice is</p><p>not going to be a problem you can do a</p><p>whole lemon not going to be a problem</p><p>kombucha there&rsquo;s different kinds the one</p><p>that you want to probably get is the one</p><p>with two grams of sugar don&rsquo;t get the</p><p>one more than that now kombucha actually</p><p>is interesting because it even though it</p><p>has it&rsquo;s made from sugar and it has a</p><p>little bit of sugar the lactic acid</p><p>yeast actually helps in some resistance</p><p>so it&rsquo;s kind of like a balancing and</p><p>most people can do 1/2 of a cup of</p><p>kombucha without any problem on a rare</p><p>occasion if the metabones really stopped</p><p>you might want to not do it but I think</p><p>you&rsquo;ll get away with that if you do that</p><p>once a day</p><p>now the calcium magnesium not a problem</p><p>that&rsquo;s me no I think it&rsquo;s a cal-mag I</p><p>think it&rsquo;s just a magnesium product I</p><p>think that&rsquo;s going to be fine I would</p><p>continue to take that before going to</p><p>sleep because that&rsquo;s just magnesium and</p><p>I think I don&rsquo;t think you have anything</p><p>to worry about I think I would just ride</p><p>the wave and I think you&rsquo;re doing fine</p><p>and those three things are not a problem</p><p>hey Carmen you&rsquo;re from Florida go ahead</p><p>you&rsquo;re on the air hi doctor it&rsquo;s a</p><p>pleasure to speak with you um I have a</p><p>a problem all the way around I&rsquo;m almost</p><p>44 years old</p><p>in the last three years I gained so much</p><p>weight do I think it is I&rsquo;m not sure and</p><p>they remove my bathwater</p><p>and ever since then I just feel like</p><p>that need to eat the world and it</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t matter interested what what did</p><p>you say you just said some after</p><p>something you didn&rsquo;t Oh</p><p>they remove my got bladder God you</p><p>remove the gallbladder okay got him</p><p>mm-hmm</p><p>and after that I gained like 60 pounds</p><p>and I feel like I need to eat everything</p><p>in the world and I cannot have any dairy</p><p>products and I just see not stay away</p><p>from them um and of course my joints</p><p>hurt now and another thing that I notice</p><p>is that I mean I&rsquo;m forgetting things</p><p>like I can do something and five minutes</p><p>later I&rsquo;m like wait that I did that</p><p>where did I put that card okay</p><p>which I know that right before that I</p><p>know where I put it but then I don&rsquo;t</p><p>remember where I put it Wow okay come</p><p>and do you have right shoulder pain or</p><p>next stuff um I have uh yeah my shoulder</p><p>hurts but isn&rsquo;t hurting for I would say</p><p>at least 20 years but it doesn&rsquo;t hurt</p><p>all the time</p><p>it hurts once in a while on the right</p><p>side yeah okay that&rsquo;s a gallbladder you</p><p>need to get the massage tools start</p><p>working on your gallbladder it&rsquo;s</p><p>underneath the right rib cage and you</p><p>massage that so in fact let me just show</p><p>you something really quick on the board</p><p>okay so basically here&rsquo;s my here&rsquo;s your</p><p>belly button right here here&rsquo;s the chest</p><p>here&rsquo;s the arms</p><p>there&rsquo;s your gallbladder which is right</p><p>there okay now they removed that thing</p><p>so what you wanted what&rsquo;s happening now</p><p>you have one little tube that connects</p><p>from your liver to the intestines so</p><p>that means that you did not you do not</p><p>have you have low bile low bile means</p><p>that you can&rsquo;t absorb the</p><p>that size of vitamins vitamin A D e k2</p><p>and some of the other essential fatty</p><p>acids that you need to get healthy lose</p><p>weight or tableaus all these other</p><p>things so now what you need to do is you</p><p>need to basically it&rsquo;s very simple you</p><p>need to add the gallbladder formula I</p><p>have which has the bile salts it has</p><p>stuff to lubricate the bile it will</p><p>start to put back in which you&rsquo;re</p><p>missing but there&rsquo;s a nerve that goes</p><p>right up here to the right shoulder so</p><p>you&rsquo;re going to have to get the massage</p><p>tool come to work on rubbing and</p><p>massaging underneath the right ribcage</p><p>but also on the left side because now</p><p>your pancreas your pancreas is</p><p>compensating by making more enzymes</p><p>that&rsquo;s called lipase so when you don&rsquo;t</p><p>have enough bile the pancreas has to</p><p>make more of this well guess what else</p><p>is going to happen when you strain the</p><p>pancreas you&rsquo;re going to increase more</p><p>insulin so it&rsquo;s going to create more</p><p>problems people that have insulin</p><p>resistance and insulin problems have low</p><p>enzymes people have enzyme problems have</p><p>higher insulin because of the pancreas</p><p>has to work harder so those are the</p><p>things that you can do to the point</p><p>where you don&rsquo;t have any pain down right</p><p>there the intermittent fasting is going</p><p>to be very important for you the</p><p>ketogenic diet is going to be very</p><p>important but over time but I would add</p><p>the gall butter formula you may need to</p><p>add some acidophiles like patanè how to</p><p>chloride to your stomach because that</p><p>will also help to gall better work if</p><p>you take the gall bladder formula and</p><p>you get any reactions at all that just</p><p>means you need more stomach acid from</p><p>apple cider vinegar in the pill or the</p><p>actual solution and then do the</p><p>acupressure on both sides you&rsquo;re going</p><p>to find that then that will start</p><p>releasing more bile and you&rsquo;ll start</p><p>losing weight the pains will go away the</p><p>symptoms go away so that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m</p><p>going to recommend what about my blood</p><p>back in here okay does that make sense</p><p>Carmen or my memory well just just to</p><p>actually handle the reason why your</p><p>memory is the problem because depression</p><p>is an essential fatty acid deficiency</p><p>and also your your brain is mostly fat</p><p>so you&rsquo;re not getting the new</p><p>trician to the brain you&rsquo;re probably</p><p>having instant resistance to the brain</p><p>and there goes the memory in the in the</p><p>brain when you have insulin resistance</p><p>it destroys something called the</p><p>hippocampus hippocampus is like the</p><p>relay switch between your database</p><p>memories and you accessing them so this</p><p>the relay switch is broken so now you&rsquo;re</p><p>like going somewhere where did I park</p><p>rather lose my keys that type of thing</p><p>that can be improved by improving the</p><p>insulin resistance of the brain and also</p><p>the goal better because it&rsquo;s date</p><p>coincidence that you had that out and</p><p>things went downhill just simply because</p><p>you&rsquo;re starving the brand of nutrition</p><p>and forcing the pancreas to work harder</p><p>thus the spiking the insulin okay this</p><p>is what that torture device I mean</p><p>treatment device looks like and you&rsquo;d</p><p>work on the gall bladder you I have a</p><p>whole technique I&rsquo;ll show you how to do</p><p>it alright great question Georgia you&rsquo;re</p><p>on the line from Florida both Gloria</p><p>sorry hi hello hello hello hi you two</p><p>question yes I do have a question I</p><p>watched your video on intermittent</p><p>fasting and what to drink and you said</p><p>no coconut water yes so I am like milk</p><p>intolerant I was doing the full fat</p><p>heavy cream in my coffee but it was</p><p>irritating me so I switched over to</p><p>coconut milk and the question is can I</p><p>drink coconut milk yeah good good</p><p>question sorry</p><p>I&rsquo;m on the keto diet yeah ah two months</p><p>go ahead okay good so yeah my suggestion</p><p>was not to drink the coconut water you</p><p>can do the coconut milk but now the</p><p>coconut water why because if coconut</p><p>water has a lot of sugar in it or sugar</p><p>grams</p><p>coconut milk does not so since your milk</p><p>intolerant you can do the coconut milk</p><p>not a problem okay</p><p>so Miriam you&rsquo;re from southern Virginia</p><p>go ahead you&rsquo;re on the air yes hi dr.</p><p>Berg thank you so much for you Jersey</p><p>youtube I wish help of all of them their</p><p>fault me and yes I have question two</p><p>questions as I&rsquo;d like to ask one it&rsquo;s</p><p>regarding fasting I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m a Muslim I&rsquo;ll</p><p>be starting the first in a week or so</p><p>I&rsquo;m doing the ketogenic diet so like it</p><p>make if you have any advice on what to</p><p>do because I will not be drinking any</p><p>like water we&rsquo;re not allowed to drink</p><p>water throughout the fast so it&rsquo;s going</p><p>to be like from Sun like in the morning</p><p>till sunset at night so my other</p><p>questions is since I&rsquo;ve been on the</p><p>ketogenic diet I&rsquo;m having back pain like</p><p>on my side I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s related</p><p>to my gallbladder so I ordered your</p><p>gallbladder formula I&rsquo;ll be getting that</p><p>tomorrow from Amazon so we&rsquo;ll try that</p><p>see double if that will help</p><p>okay great thank you so much you&rsquo;re</p><p>welcome okay so so the good thing is</p><p>that you can do Ramadan you can do the</p><p>eating the meal in the early morning or</p><p>late at night okay when the sun goes</p><p>down and completely have the whole day</p><p>where you&rsquo;re fasting just make sure that</p><p>you don&rsquo;t add carbs make sure that the</p><p>quality of eating is is good and you can</p><p>do that I think that&rsquo;s perfect it&rsquo;s like</p><p>you&rsquo;re fast right there you&rsquo;re in a</p><p>minute fasting right there so you do</p><p>right before the Sun goes up early</p><p>morning and then when the sun goes down</p><p>go ahead and eat again so you get two</p><p>meals so I think you&rsquo;re going to be fine</p><p>than that now that pain that you have it</p><p>definitely could be either gallbladder</p><p>or a kidney stone okay so I don&rsquo;t know</p><p>which one it is but just to make sure</p><p>because when you do a ketogenic diet</p><p>sometimes you start to you could have a</p><p>tendency to get</p><p>more of a stone especially if you&rsquo;re</p><p>doing spinach and nuts and things like</p><p>that that&rsquo;s high in oxide stones so</p><p>here&rsquo;s what you need to do if you have</p><p>back pain like that one thing is to</p><p>drink more water with with potassium</p><p>chloride that&rsquo;s in my electrolyte powder</p><p>you can do that or just get potassium</p><p>citrate not don&rsquo;t do chloride do</p><p>potassium citrate so you can either get</p><p>it or in a supplement war you can get it</p><p>in the electrolytes but you take that at</p><p>least a thousand milligrams twice a day</p><p>because the citrate split off and that</p><p>will dissolve the oxalate stones in</p><p>addition to that drink add lemon</p><p>okay so lemon juice you can have it in a</p><p>bottle or just actual lemons and you</p><p>start drinking more water with more</p><p>lemon which is going to give you citrate</p><p>and the potassium citrate so you drink</p><p>that that will help two types of stones</p><p>the uric acid stones or the oxalate</p><p>stones which are the most common and</p><p>then that way</p><p>that pain should go away but the pain in</p><p>your back could be either kidney or gall</p><p>bladder and we don&rsquo;t know what it is but</p><p>I would just do both of those in the</p><p>pain should go away if it doesn&rsquo;t go you</p><p>might get an ultrasound and see what&rsquo;s</p><p>going on if there&rsquo;s little stone there</p><p>because if there&rsquo;s a kidney stone</p><p>obviously you want to handle it but you</p><p>can handle it with diet okay I think I</p><p>answered your question okay so then we</p><p>have ROG beer from Toronto yes hi hi</p><p>actually the question is I have so many</p><p>questions I am a really big fan of you</p><p>so the my daughter she&rsquo;s 16 years old</p><p>and she has the last time periods in</p><p>December and if you don&rsquo;t have the</p><p>periods so if I go to the doctor they&rsquo;re</p><p>going to give her the blood control pack</p><p>right so that she can use your estrogen</p><p>balance or formula that one she can use</p><p>yeah yeah that&rsquo;s gonna that&rsquo;s good</p><p>because when you have estrogen dominant</p><p>you become infertile</p><p>so that would be the first thing I would</p><p>do to clean that up especially if</p><p>someone is younger like that that&rsquo;s an</p><p>estrogen dominant thing and even if</p><p>there&rsquo;s some pesticides or things that</p><p>are mimicking that that&rsquo;s what I would</p><p>recommend the estrogen balance with dim</p><p>in addition to that what you might want</p><p>to do is make sure that she gets on the</p><p>eating plan that I&rsquo;m recommending</p><p>especially a little bit more fat and</p><p>cholesterol which basically is a</p><p>precursor for building up those hormones</p><p>especially after are like progesterone</p><p>and some of the other hormones so just</p><p>to make sure she has that and there&rsquo;s a</p><p>there&rsquo;s a couple other things but those</p><p>that would be like the the first thing I</p><p>would do and also royal jelly is another</p><p>supplement that you can get to kick in</p><p>the fertility and the other cycle to</p><p>make it work better I recommend that as</p><p>well did you have another question I can</p><p>get that the royal jelly any health food</p><p>store online and the one would think</p><p>that my husband he has the high-class</p><p>droid yes but we try so many things and</p><p>now he&rsquo;s taking the 5 milligram the</p><p>Crestron and that is helping her but</p><p>before we check is the his hormones is</p><p>really lower side so she he can use that</p><p>test Rosen okay so does he is the UH</p><p>needing plan that we&rsquo;re recommending</p><p>yeah because before is the five years</p><p>ago I am doing the same thing here in</p><p>Toronto one doctor is I follow him and</p><p>that time I lose weight he lose weight</p><p>too but he check do things but not to</p><p>really have so he can using that plan</p><p>Jackie - Janet yeah yeah he needs to do</p><p>the the ketogenic plan one thing for</p><p>cholesterol would be the k2 d3 with red</p><p>yeast that&rsquo;s very powerful lower</p><p>cholesterol but here here&rsquo;s the point I</p><p>want to make</p><p>excuse me when you have people that do</p><p>the ketogenic diet intermittent fasting</p><p>sometimes their cholesterol will go up</p><p>okay even the LDL and I want to explain</p><p>that first of all your cells your fat</p><p>cells are composed of triglycerides and</p><p>cholesterol people don&rsquo;t realize that</p><p>like in your cells and your fat cells</p><p>there&rsquo;s store cholesterol in there so</p><p>when you lose weight these cells are</p><p>going to shrink right so you&rsquo;re going to</p><p>release this fat the fats going to be</p><p>burned the triglycerides are going to be</p><p>burned but not the cholesterol</p><p>cholesterol is never burned as fuel in</p><p>the body it&rsquo;s used as a structural</p><p>material to build cell membranes so</p><p>naturally your cholesterol is going to</p><p>go up for a period of time but as long</p><p>as your triglycerides are down you&rsquo;re</p><p>totally safe because then we know it&rsquo;s</p><p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s not the bad type of</p><p>cholesterol</p><p>it&rsquo;s basically an LDL which is just</p><p>coming out of the fat cells going to the</p><p>liver going through the bile as long as</p><p>you have a healthy liver and you have</p><p>good bile release and there&rsquo;s no backup</p><p>there you&rsquo;re totally in fine fact I will</p><p>create a video on that but that&rsquo;s why</p><p>it&rsquo;s high and then if someone goes on a</p><p>statin drug and lower is it it&rsquo;s just</p><p>like now they have all these other</p><p>symptoms so I got to do a video on that</p><p>because that&rsquo;s a common question hey</p><p>Whitney you&rsquo;re on the air you&rsquo;re from</p><p>Southern Maryland go ahead hi there dr.</p><p>Byrd all right</p><p>hi I caught a little bit of the caller</p><p>earlier that talked about not having a</p><p>gallbladder and they health problems</p><p>that ensues after um and I&rsquo;ve had all</p><p>kinds of problems since since the</p><p>removal my gallbladder</p><p>um now I&rsquo;ve been on key to Jan and I&rsquo;m</p><p>about I don&rsquo;t know maybe about 40 to 45</p><p>pounds overweight</p><p>or I was so I started kita Janet about</p><p>three about three months ago on down 25</p><p>pounds I I feel fantastic</p><p>but I tell you what it made a huge</p><p>difference on a side note is that</p><p>electrolyte powder I started using that</p><p>about a month ago and I would not be</p><p>able to do ketogenic without it</p><p>um now is there I just started last week</p><p>doing a bulletproof coffee with the</p><p>butter I and the MCT oil and I can go</p><p>all day long without eating I&rsquo;m just not</p><p>hungry and and eat my dinner and I try</p><p>and stay within an eight-hour window I</p><p>is that okay for me to be doing without</p><p>a gall bladder good question okay as</p><p>long as you&rsquo;re absorbing all of the fat</p><p>soluble vitamins because without a goal</p><p>better you can&rsquo;t concentrate bile but</p><p>because you&rsquo;re only eating like real one</p><p>meal and then you&rsquo;re doing the</p><p>bulletproof coffee the other other meal</p><p>you&rsquo;re not going to need as much bile so</p><p>you may be okay with that</p><p>but the thing that we want to find out</p><p>is you got to try to get as much</p><p>nutrition from that one meal as possible</p><p>because there&rsquo;s not a lot of nutrition</p><p>in MCTS other than that fat there&rsquo;s not</p><p>enough vitamins and minerals there&rsquo;s a</p><p>couple but there&rsquo;s not the whole</p><p>complete complex so you&rsquo;re going to have</p><p>that one meal is going to have to be</p><p>pretty darn concentrated with nutrients</p><p>so you might want to have instead of</p><p>like a salad do a kale salad instead of</p><p>like regular I don&rsquo;t know chicken you</p><p>would do more salmon wild-caught just do</p><p>real high quality foods and then you&rsquo;re</p><p>probably and you&rsquo;re doing the</p><p>electrolyte balance which is going to</p><p>give you that and then you might need to</p><p>enhance the B vitamins a little bit</p><p>maybe with nutritional yeast and I think</p><p>you&rsquo;re going to be okay I don&rsquo;t think</p><p>you&rsquo;re having a problem with this</p><p>bulletproof coffee because it&rsquo;s able to</p><p>sustain you so until you start seeing</p><p>other problems I would ride the wave and</p><p>do it but at some point if you start</p><p>having problems that are gallbladder</p><p>related I would take</p><p>gall bladder Formula One after that one</p><p>meal and that will just put the icing on</p><p>the cake well maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t talk</p><p>about icing on the cake all right</p><p>hey Jenny you&rsquo;re on the air here from</p><p>Missouri go ahead yes hi I first want to</p><p>thank you so much for being there for us</p><p>you&rsquo;re saving lives giving hope to</p><p>people who have none I also wanted to</p><p>ask you about multivitamin mineral that</p><p>you might recommend and I also have</p><p>another question okay good so thank you</p><p>I appreciate that I&rsquo;m getting these</p><p>before-and-afters and I&rsquo;m posting them</p><p>on dr. Berg for its last review I am</p><p>literally blown away people over the</p><p>world showing them sending the before</p><p>and after pictures I&rsquo;m just like wow</p><p>it&rsquo;s amazing okay so the best</p><p>multivitamin I would get a food based</p><p>complex not a multivitamin at the</p><p>wheatgrass is what I use as my multi but</p><p>I don&rsquo;t have any other specific</p><p>recommendations for other other</p><p>companies because even though they use</p><p>natural vitamins they&rsquo;re still out of</p><p>the complex so in nature vitamins always</p><p>come in complexes so with vitamin C you</p><p>have bioflavonoids you have tyrosinase</p><p>an enzyme that&rsquo;s copper you have the P</p><p>factor the K factor the score pick acid</p><p>the whole thing versus just like one</p><p>individual scorebook acid so I would get</p><p>a food base concentrate like the</p><p>wheatgrass juice powder that would be</p><p>something maybe add the B there&rsquo;s</p><p>nutritional yeast as a complex because</p><p>it has all the B&rsquo;s in it versus just one</p><p>individual one that&rsquo;s what I would do</p><p>and then you had one more another</p><p>question oh yes I&rsquo;m about to start the</p><p>keto diet and in the past I went through</p><p>an acute renal failure and I&rsquo;ll need to</p><p>know if the keto would be harmful for</p><p>someone like me what kind of failure I</p><p>went through acute renal failure kidney</p><p>failure years ago when when you went on</p><p>the ketogenic diet yeah no no I</p><p>then on the cheat okay before you know I</p><p>I was just wondering if my kidney and</p><p>liver would be healthy enough for</p><p>starting the diet well I think the diet</p><p>is a necessary thing for a damaged</p><p>kidney it&rsquo;s absolutely an S it&rsquo;s a</p><p>requirement to start to protect the</p><p>kidney when you do in a minute fasting</p><p>there are certain factors that actually</p><p>protect the kidney you probably be</p><p>really uh you&rsquo;d probably really benefit</p><p>from the electrolyte powder that I have</p><p>because the potassium actually in there</p><p>protects the kidney as well now someone</p><p>will say wait a second I thought a</p><p>damaged kiddin you can&rsquo;t do a lot of</p><p>potassium that&rsquo;s only that&rsquo;s only if</p><p>you&rsquo;re on a kidney dialysis but you&rsquo;re</p><p>not a good amount of potassium is very</p><p>kidney protective so I would do that I</p><p>would totally do the ketogenic diet I</p><p>would cut down the insulin which</p><p>destroys the kidney think about what is</p><p>the number one killer to kidney it&rsquo;s</p><p>insulin look at a diabetic they always</p><p>end up with renal failure so that&rsquo;s</p><p>exactly like people say well as my hell</p><p>is my liver and kidney healthy enough no</p><p>the diet is a necessary thing to reverse</p><p>the damage it&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s your only</p><p>option is to go on that eating plan to</p><p>fix the real cause yeah definitely do it</p><p>so we have a call from Michael you&rsquo;re</p><p>from Sacramento go ahead you&rsquo;re on the</p><p>air hi dr. Burke I recently found your</p><p>site and I&rsquo;m really enjoying all of the</p><p>information I had I had two questions</p><p>for you the first is about intermittent</p><p>fasting I&rsquo;ve only been on a peanut jinuk</p><p>diet for going on about three weeks and</p><p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m that adapted yet</p><p>because I still get hungry at about meal</p><p>time for every meal and I wake up</p><p>ravenous so as far as you know skipping</p><p>skipping breakfast and having that be</p><p>the intermittent fast part of my day the</p><p>majority of my workday is in the morning</p><p>I&rsquo;m wondering if you have any</p><p>suggestions about how to make that work</p><p>yeah what time you wake up um about 6:30</p><p>okay and then you eat right right at</p><p>that point I usually eat a</p><p>at about 7:15 or so okay what do we what</p><p>do you eat</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been eating usually three or four</p><p>eggs and some little beef sausages I</p><p>don&rsquo;t eat pork so I can&rsquo;t do bacon but</p><p>the beef sausages have a decent fat</p><p>content to them good and I&rsquo;m and then</p><p>you can and that&rsquo;s usually about okay go</p><p>ahead you&rsquo;re saying I don&rsquo;t know that</p><p>was it okay and then the next time you</p><p>eat is that lunch and that&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re</p><p>really really hungry right yeah I&rsquo;m</p><p>usually pretty hungry it&rsquo;s not</p><p>intolerable though I just</p><p>I know I&rsquo;m I know I&rsquo;m hungry for lunch</p><p>usually by about 11:00 or 12:00 okay</p><p>so you&rsquo;re just really in this transition</p><p>phase right now and let me give you some</p><p>tips on how to improve it if you are</p><p>waking up and you&rsquo;re Ravis ly hungry</p><p>like I was you want to eat you&rsquo;re eating</p><p>your protein your fat but you want to</p><p>also add potassium for that breakfast</p><p>and I would take a kale shake do the</p><p>kale in there maybe just a little stevia</p><p>to sweeten it you know I have the kale</p><p>shake recipe you can go ahead and do</p><p>that and then drink the kale or do an</p><p>avocado why because the potassium is</p><p>going to start healing you of the</p><p>insulin resistance that you have now the</p><p>fact that you&rsquo;re you able to get through</p><p>lunch you&rsquo;re hungry but you doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>sound like your blood sugar problems</p><p>then that&rsquo;s good that&rsquo;s fine so eat that</p><p>meal and then you&rsquo;re going to have to go</p><p>until dinner now you have to do that</p><p>over a period of time that&rsquo;s going to</p><p>get better and better and better and</p><p>then what you do as you graduate into</p><p>adaptation is that you wait longer and</p><p>longer so so you wait an hour and then</p><p>two hours and three hours and four hours</p><p>in the morning before you eat that first</p><p>meal that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re going to have to</p><p>do but I think what you&rsquo;re missing is</p><p>the potassium and then add the outside</p><p>of vinegar to that as well and that that</p><p>should actually help you but I would</p><p>recommend like three meals a day okay</p><p>and if you can&rsquo;t go from lunch to dinner</p><p>add a little bit more fat to that meal</p><p>and make sure your potassium</p><p>is high okay great so with the last</p><p>caller Vicki you&rsquo;re from Arizona go</p><p>ahead good morning boy um first of all</p><p>thank you for all of your information</p><p>it&rsquo;s just amazing</p><p>my pleasure i started the ketogenic diet</p><p>but kind of related to it I have been</p><p>having this itching in a left breast</p><p>that&rsquo;s gotten worse gradually with over</p><p>a year and I noticed it with food is</p><p>when it started it would be like if I</p><p>ate something I would sweat and I</p><p>thought it was having allergic reactions</p><p>to certain foods I was on hormones for</p><p>over thirty years and they the doctor</p><p>took me off of it last year because of</p><p>the itching and he said just in case</p><p>well it&rsquo;s within the past year it&rsquo;s just</p><p>gradually gotten worse and worse they</p><p>did just the regular mammogram and they</p><p>did an ultrasound and have found nothing</p><p>but the more I&rsquo;ve researched and studied</p><p>the more I&rsquo;ve read that there is</p><p>something called inflammatory breast</p><p>cancer I don&rsquo;t know if this is in your</p><p>realm I was just wondering anything</p><p>about it and the more I&rsquo;ve read the more</p><p>the strangest thing is to eat apricot</p><p>seeds if there is a chance of that</p><p>so isn&rsquo;t he heard any is it the right</p><p>right breast and it is the left breast</p><p>left okay</p><p>yes sure okay yeah um okay so I&rsquo;ll just</p><p>give you a couple tips that that I know</p><p>I have not heard of inflammatory breast</p><p>cancer so I don&rsquo;t have any data on that</p><p>I don&rsquo;t have a lot of data in apricot</p><p>pits but I will say this that if you you</p><p>have an itching that is usually</p><p>something going on with the liver you</p><p>you might be doing a little detox from</p><p>all the estrogen from the liver so</p><p>there&rsquo;s a couple things that you can do</p><p>for eating one would be</p><p>to do the estrogen balance with dim</p><p>since you had a history of that that</p><p>cleans up all the bad estrogen and do</p><p>some type of shakes with kale beet tops</p><p>and parsley maybe put a little bit of</p><p>berries in there to start to really</p><p>flesh out the liver which basically you</p><p>have a lot of lymphatics in your liver</p><p>so that will flush out the liver and</p><p>keep your lymphatics clean which will</p><p>then stop backing up to the breast</p><p>tissue because there is lymphatics</p><p>through the breast tissue so go ahead</p><p>and do that and milk thistle is one more</p><p>thing that I&rsquo;d probably add to it for</p><p>the liver and let us know how you do</p><p>thanks Vicki hey guys I just want to say</p><p>thank you so much for your wonderful</p><p>questions until next week watch the</p><p>videos I&rsquo;ll be sending out daily and</p><p>I&rsquo;ll talk to you real soon</p><p>you</p><p>you</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
