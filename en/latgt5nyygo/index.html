show you how to avoid all the keto side effects okay in this one simple video there&amp;rsquo;s many things that happen but can be prevented if you know what to do in the healthy keto program that i have which i&amp;rsquo;m going to put a link down below which will explain everything if you do the correct eating plan from the very beginning you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have any of these side effects it&amp;rsquo;s when people try to do sort of keto and they don&amp;rsquo;t do it correctly that they end up having issues let&amp;rsquo;s start at the top here brain fog that can be a deficiency of b vitamins especially vitamin b1 and also ketones in the transition phase when you&amp;rsquo;re starting keto it takes like three days and sometimes there&amp;rsquo;s this transition period where your your brain doesn&amp;rsquo;t have enough fuel it can&amp;rsquo;t generate the ketones it&amp;rsquo;s fast enough and so you might want to increase your ketones by taking mct oil okay and that can give you the ketones right away and the brain fog goes completely bye-bye now also nutritional yeast can also help all right uric acid okay that&amp;rsquo;s involved in gout when you start fasting certain people start having higher levels of uric acid uric acid is an antioxidant so it&amp;rsquo;s trying to help you but if you&amp;rsquo;re prone to gout you can notice pain in your big toe okay so a simple solution is to take a green drink like wheatgrass juice powder in your water which will alkalize you and alter the ph to the point where your immune system doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to create this inflammatory reaction anymore really simple solution you can also do potassium citrate that works but a green drink also works like magic all right next one is high cholesterol i&amp;rsquo;ve done a separate video on this but just so you know this might mean that you need some more bile salt some more help with the gallbladder to help to break down this cholesterol but normally it&amp;rsquo;s not a problem all right kidney stone if you&amp;rsquo;re prone to kidney stones the most important thing to do is to drink no less than two and a half liters of fluid a day that will keep things diluted you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to form a stone because kidney stones are a super saturated situation okay so if you drink enough fluid you just can&amp;rsquo;t form stones anymore also potassium citrate is really good because first of all potassium is a protective to the kidney and it actually helps decrease the risk of kidney stones and the citrate also binds with oxalates which are the most common form of kidney stones calcium oxalates so the citrate will kind of prevent that and also from your diet you want to make sure you&amp;rsquo;re not consuming foods high in oxalates that would be almond and almond flour and almond butter spinach chocolate which are all common foods on keto there&amp;rsquo;s a lot more data to know about this watch my videos if you&amp;rsquo;re interested okay digestive problems if you get constipation or diarrhea that&amp;rsquo;s new for you you start the keto program all of a sudden you become constipated or diarrhea most likely you need to adjust the vegetables you&amp;rsquo;re either not having enough or you&amp;rsquo;re consuming too many so it&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of comparing what you did before to now and if you&amp;rsquo;re eating a ton of vegetables it could mean that you need to cut cut it down because your microbes in your gut can&amp;rsquo;t digest and deal with all that fiber or it could mean that you need to increase the amount of vegetables so just make some adjustments and that should help now if you get bloating typically it means you&amp;rsquo;re lacking bile now that could come for many reasons maybe you don&amp;rsquo;t have a gallbladder maybe you&amp;rsquo;re just your liver is fatty maybe you&amp;rsquo;re just sluggish but more bio will help bloating now if you get abdominal pain that usually is lectins lectins are in vegetables they&amp;rsquo;re in beans they&amp;rsquo;re in peanuts they&amp;rsquo;re a lot of different foods so you may even need to cut out your vegetables for a while and go carnivore just to get rid of that pain because you&amp;rsquo;re you might have leaky gut or some inflammatory situation that now you&amp;rsquo;re sensitive to plants so that&amp;rsquo;s one point and then also if you have acid reflux that just means you need more acidifiers so betaine hydrochloride is a good one apple cider vinegar is another good thing you can take that will actually help keep that valve nice and close sometimes you need more b1 to help close the valve on an occasion if you have like an ulcer which is not a side effect of gout but if you have an ulcer zinc is probably one of the best remedies for that let&amp;rsquo;s say you start getting acne that usually is because you&amp;rsquo;re you&amp;rsquo;re sensitive to dairy i would just avoid the dairy and your skin should clear up also dairy can enlarge either a fibroid in women or men can enlarge the prostate so if you are a guy and have prostate issues or urination problems you might need to cut out the dairy for a bit okay muscle cramps or heart palpitations same remedy you need electrolytes magnesium potassium and sea salt all right next one you&amp;rsquo;re irritable or you have headaches you need vitamin b1 nutritional yeast is wonderful it should make you feel nice and calm within about three minutes now you have gallbladder pain pain underneath the right rib cage that can refer to the right shoulder up through here or the back that usually means that you need to cut down the nuts and especially peanut butter why because most nuts are high in omega-6 which is inflammatory and plus there are certain type of enzyme inhibitors which make them difficult to digest in peanuts you have high levels of a certain toxin that comes from a fungus that can irritate the gallbladder and create a lot of issues this is why you always want to do organic nuts and valencia peanut or valencia peanut butter very very important because here&amp;rsquo;s the thing you might say well it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if they spray these nuts because the shell is really really hard right like walnuts it won&amp;rsquo;t penetrate but what happens is when they crack the shell open they spray after it&amp;rsquo;s open so you want to do organic nuts and that should help you but i think cutting out nuts would be good and you may need to cut out some of the extra oils that you&amp;rsquo;re consuming that you might not have enough bile to actually digest some of that fat so taking a purified bile salts or a gallbladder formula very helpful in this situation but usually when you take out the nuts problem solved all right bad breath this is a temporary problem usually because you&amp;rsquo;re not offsetting the high level of ketones with something to neutralize that like leafy greens like large salads sometimes you&amp;rsquo;re doing too much protein so you want to make your protein moderate because too much protein can give off too much ammonia and that can come off in the breath a rash keto rash that is usually a b vitamin deficiency take nutritional yeast it&amp;rsquo;s usually vitamin b2 and b3 that&amp;rsquo;s deficient when you start burning more fat and you&amp;rsquo;re running off your ketones the metabolic pathways are slightly different and you need certain nutrients and higher levels definitely more b vitamins then we get the keto fatigue and keto flu that is usually just upping the sea salt himalayan sea salt is the best and or taking potassium in a good electrolyte powder that should handle that so sometimes if you have this blood pressure fluctuation that happens when you start keto try increasing sea salt and then try decreasing and one of them usually will handle it and you might need to also add potassium with even some vitamin d and that should should handle it also the low salt can trigger more adrenaline which can then keep you up at night and you can have insomnia which leads us to this point right here so you might need more sea salt if you&amp;rsquo;re not sleeping and sometimes a little calcium a good source of calcium would be of course calcium citrate or lactate those are the two that i recommend all right there you go keto side effects in a nutshell hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it&amp;rsquo;s a free course i want you to take it and here&amp;rsquo;s why here&amp;rsquo;s you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system

the keto side effects okay in this one  </p><p>simple video there&rsquo;s many things that happen 
but can be prevented if you know what to do  </p><p>in the healthy keto program that i have 
which i&rsquo;m going to put a link down below  </p><p>which will explain everything if you do the 
correct eating plan from the very beginning  </p><p>you shouldn&rsquo;t have any of these 
side effects it&rsquo;s when people try to  </p><p>do sort of keto and they don&rsquo;t do it correctly 
that they end up having issues let&rsquo;s start at the  </p><p>top here brain fog that can be a deficiency of b 
vitamins especially vitamin b1 and also ketones in  </p><p>the transition phase when you&rsquo;re starting keto it 
takes like three days and sometimes there&rsquo;s this  </p><p>transition period where your your brain doesn&rsquo;t 
have enough fuel it can&rsquo;t generate the ketones  </p><p>it&rsquo;s fast enough and so you might want to 
increase your ketones by taking mct oil  </p><p>okay and that can give you the ketones right 
away and the brain fog goes completely bye-bye  </p><p>now also nutritional yeast can also help all 
right uric acid okay that&rsquo;s involved in gout  </p><p>when you start fasting certain people start 
having higher levels of uric acid uric acid is  </p><p>an antioxidant so it&rsquo;s trying to help you but if 
you&rsquo;re prone to gout you can notice pain in your  </p><p>big toe okay so a simple solution is to take a 
green drink like wheatgrass juice powder in your  </p><p>water which will alkalize you and alter the ph to 
the point where your immune system doesn&rsquo;t have to  </p><p>create this inflammatory reaction anymore really 
simple solution you can also do potassium citrate  </p><p>that works but a green drink also works like magic 
all right next one is high cholesterol i&rsquo;ve done  </p><p>a separate video on this but just so you know 
this might mean that you need some more bile salt  </p><p>some more help with the gallbladder to help 
to break down this cholesterol but normally  </p><p>it&rsquo;s not a problem all right kidney 
stone if you&rsquo;re prone to kidney stones  </p><p>the most important thing to do is to drink no 
less than two and a half liters of fluid a day  </p><p>that will keep things diluted you won&rsquo;t be able 
to form a stone because kidney stones are a  </p><p>super saturated situation okay so if you drink 
enough fluid you just can&rsquo;t form stones anymore  </p><p>also potassium citrate is really good because 
first of all potassium is a protective to the  </p><p>kidney and it actually helps decrease the risk 
of kidney stones and the citrate also binds  </p><p>with oxalates which are the most common form of 
kidney stones calcium oxalates so the citrate will  </p><p>kind of prevent that and also from your diet 
you want to make sure you&rsquo;re not consuming  </p><p>foods high in oxalates that would be almond 
and almond flour and almond butter spinach  </p><p>chocolate which are all common foods on keto 
there&rsquo;s a lot more data to know about this  </p><p>watch my videos if you&rsquo;re interested okay 
digestive problems if you get constipation or  </p><p>diarrhea that&rsquo;s new for you you start the keto 
program all of a sudden you become constipated  </p><p>or diarrhea most likely you need to adjust the 
vegetables you&rsquo;re either not having enough or  </p><p>you&rsquo;re consuming too many so it&rsquo;s just a matter of 
comparing what you did before to now and if you&rsquo;re  </p><p>eating a ton of vegetables it could mean that you 
need to cut cut it down because your microbes in  </p><p>your gut can&rsquo;t digest and deal with all that fiber 
or it could mean that you need to increase the  </p><p>amount of vegetables so just make some adjustments 
and that should help now if you get bloating  </p><p>typically it means you&rsquo;re lacking bile now that 
could come for many reasons maybe you don&rsquo;t have  </p><p>a gallbladder maybe you&rsquo;re just your liver is 
fatty maybe you&rsquo;re just sluggish but more bio  </p><p>will help bloating now if you get abdominal pain 
that usually is lectins lectins are in vegetables  </p><p>they&rsquo;re in beans they&rsquo;re in peanuts they&rsquo;re a lot 
of different foods so you may even need to cut out  </p><p>your vegetables for a while and go carnivore 
just to get rid of that pain because you&rsquo;re  </p><p>you might have leaky gut or some inflammatory 
situation that now you&rsquo;re sensitive to plants  </p><p>so that&rsquo;s one point and then also if you have acid 
reflux that just means you need more acidifiers so  </p><p>betaine hydrochloride is a good one apple cider 
vinegar is another good thing you can take that  </p><p>will actually help keep that valve nice and close 
sometimes you need more b1 to help close the valve  </p><p>on an occasion if you have like an ulcer which is 
not a side effect of gout but if you have an ulcer  </p><p>zinc is probably one of the best remedies for that 
let&rsquo;s say you start getting acne that usually is  </p><p>because you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re sensitive to dairy i would 
just avoid the dairy and your skin should clear  </p><p>up also dairy can enlarge either a fibroid 
in women or men can enlarge the prostate so  </p><p>if you are a guy and have prostate issues or 
urination problems you might need to cut out  </p><p>the dairy for a bit okay muscle cramps or heart 
palpitations same remedy you need electrolytes  </p><p>magnesium potassium and sea salt all right 
next one you&rsquo;re irritable or you have headaches  </p><p>you need vitamin b1 nutritional yeast is wonderful 
it should make you feel nice and calm within about  </p><p>three minutes now you have gallbladder pain pain 
underneath the right rib cage that can refer to  </p><p>the right shoulder up through here or the back 
that usually means that you need to cut down the  </p><p>nuts and especially peanut butter why because most 
nuts are high in omega-6 which is inflammatory  </p><p>and plus there are certain type of enzyme 
inhibitors which make them difficult to digest  </p><p>in peanuts you have high levels of a certain 
toxin that comes from a fungus that can irritate  </p><p>the gallbladder and create a lot of issues 
this is why you always want to do organic nuts  </p><p>and valencia peanut or valencia peanut butter 
very very important because here&rsquo;s the thing  </p><p>you might say well it doesn&rsquo;t matter if they spray 
these nuts because the shell is really really hard  </p><p>right like walnuts it won&rsquo;t penetrate but 
what happens is when they crack the shell open  </p><p>they spray after it&rsquo;s open so you want to 
do organic nuts and that should help you  </p><p>but i think cutting out nuts would be good and 
you may need to cut out some of the extra oils  </p><p>that you&rsquo;re consuming that you might not have 
enough bile to actually digest some of that fat  </p><p>so taking a purified bile salts or a gallbladder 
formula very helpful in this situation  </p><p>but usually when you take out the nuts 
problem solved all right bad breath this  </p><p>is a temporary problem usually because you&rsquo;re 
not offsetting the high level of ketones with  </p><p>something to neutralize that like leafy greens 
like large salads sometimes you&rsquo;re doing too much  </p><p>protein so you want to make your protein moderate 
because too much protein can give off too much  </p><p>ammonia and that can come off in the breath a rash 
keto rash that is usually a b vitamin deficiency  </p><p>take nutritional yeast it&rsquo;s usually 
vitamin b2 and b3 that&rsquo;s deficient  </p><p>when you start burning more fat 
and you&rsquo;re running off your ketones  </p><p>the metabolic pathways are slightly different 
and you need certain nutrients and higher levels  </p><p>definitely more b vitamins then we get the keto 
fatigue and keto flu that is usually just upping  </p><p>the sea salt himalayan sea salt is the best and 
or taking potassium in a good electrolyte powder  </p><p>that should handle that so sometimes if you have 
this blood pressure fluctuation that happens when  </p><p>you start keto try increasing sea salt and then 
try decreasing and one of them usually will handle  </p><p>it and you might need to also add potassium with 
even some vitamin d and that should should handle  </p><p>it also the low salt can trigger more adrenaline 
which can then keep you up at night and you can  </p><p>have insomnia which leads us to this point right 
here so you might need more sea salt if you&rsquo;re not  </p><p>sleeping and sometimes a little calcium a good 
source of calcium would be of course calcium  </p><p>citrate or lactate those are the two that i 
recommend all right there you go keto side  </p><p>effects in a nutshell hey before you go 
real quick i have a course entitled how  </p><p>to bulletproof your immune system it&rsquo;s a free 
course i want you to take it and here&rsquo;s why  </p><p>here&rsquo;s you here is your environment everyone 
is focused on this over here avoiding  </p><p>your environment but what about here what about 
strengthening your immune system that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s  </p><p>missing this course will show you how to 
bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate  </p><p>and resist your environment much better by 
strengthening your own immune system i put  </p><p>a link down in the description right down
