<p>that I want to talk about is it&rsquo;s and</p>
<p>this is something I kind of just</p>
<p>stumbled on and I had a lightbulb go off</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not lose weight and get healthy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s get healthy to lose weight that</p>
<p>might sound like a real simple little</p>
<p>principle but it&rsquo;s very very vital</p>
<p>because if you try to lose weight to get</p>
<p>healthy you may not end up being healthy</p>
<p>people try to lose weight unhealthy you</p>
<p>lose muscle mass and you feel like crap</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re trying to lose weight and</p>
<p>you you feel like crap you&rsquo;re not doing</p>
<p>it healthy so what does this mean</p>
<p>getting healthy well you&rsquo;re going from</p>
<p>an unhealthy state to a healthy state so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually repairing certain things</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a repair mode when your body</p>
<p>repairs it fixes structural part of the</p>
<p>cell the cell membrane and what does it</p>
<p>use it uses protein to repair if you</p>
<p>have a if you&rsquo;re a hoarder and you have</p>
<p>this house filled with stuff and the</p>
<p>walls are caving down the smartest thing</p>
<p>to do would be to make sure your</p>
<p>structure is stabilized first before you</p>
<p>move everything out and sometimes with</p>
<p>the body</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t just mobilize fat as a first</p>
<p>priority it tends to go into healing a</p>
<p>repair mode and it fixes the structure</p>
<p>of the body but when that happens</p>
<p>protein comes in which is heavier than</p>
<p>fat per volume I know one time I did a</p>
<p>video and I said well one pound of fat</p>
<p>one pound of fat is lighter than one</p>
<p>kind of mile so I&rsquo;m like now one pound</p>
<p>is equal to one so we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>per volume that&rsquo;s a whole different</p>
<p>thing so when I get this thing we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like oh I&rsquo;m not losing weight well your</p>
<p>body&rsquo;s probably in repair mode so we</p>
<p>want to look at other factors like your</p>
<p>energy your strength your fight</p>
<p>tality is your cravings go away are you</p>
<p>less hungry those are the things that</p>
<p>you want to focus on more than the</p>
<p>weight the weight is this one indicator</p>
<p>the way there&rsquo;s a side effect of getting</p>
<p>healthy so it&rsquo;s a real simple principle</p>
<p>but a lot of people don&rsquo;t really know</p>
<p>about that and then when you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to solve a problem you have to evaluate</p>
<p>you have to need more data because if</p>
<p>you just said oh I can&rsquo;t lose weight</p>
<p>what do I do I mean like I don&rsquo;t know I</p>
<p>have to find out from you a lot of data</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just to sort this out one of the</p>
<p>most important questions that you can</p>
<p>ask that I wish was asked more is</p>
<p>perfect on cue I just wanted that</p>
<p>leading the best question is okay when</p>
<p>did you start gaining weight what</p>
<p>happened just before that I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about a stubborn metabolism like let me</p>
<p>just ask you how many of you started</p>
<p>gaining weight after a pregnancy that</p>
<p>you had boom right there right how many</p>
<p>of you gained weight maybe as a child</p>
<p>you were just always overweight well</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not really necessarily born that</p>
<p>way there&rsquo;s something that happens maybe</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re five you had a surgery or</p>
<p>something or asthma and then you took</p>
<p>steroids boom that that gives us great</p>
<p>data or let&rsquo;s say you had a stress event</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s not any of you but if</p>
<p>you had a severe loss of a loved one all</p>
<p>these things are behind and you have to</p>
<p>pull and find out what happened just</p>
<p>before that problem started it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>simple question no one asks it and you</p>
<p>need to to get well so the first barrier</p>
<p>is to make sure that you&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>healthily and the last thing I want to</p>
<p>do is give up when it actually is</p>
<p>working so all people that are like</p>
<p>there yeah it&rsquo;s not working but it</p>
<p>really was and they give up and I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>boy you just you should have just gave</p>
<p>it given more time the next point I want</p>
<p>to bring up is you also have to look at</p>
<p>the duration of how long you have this</p>
<p>problem insulin resistance doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>happen overnight it takes years to</p>
<p>develop into diabetes by the time it</p>
<p>shows up it&rsquo;s already been brewing in</p>
<p>the oven ami was talking about</p>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s it takes</p>
<p>how many years like 30 years before it</p>
<p>even shows up yeah years I mean it</p>
<p>starts here and then it develops and all</p>
<p>of a sudden you end you don&rsquo;t just end</p>
<p>up overnight so these things take years</p>
<p>to develop so it&rsquo;s brewing in the oven</p>
<p>cancer takes a long time by Roy problems</p>
<p>take a long time dream will gland</p>
<p>problems there&rsquo;s one piece of data that</p>
<p>I talk about it&rsquo;s like night almost 95%</p>
<p>of the adrenal gland has to be</p>
<p>unresponsive before even shows up</p>
<p>clinically in some cases so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dealing with problems that develop over</p>
<p>a long period of time a fatty liver</p>
<p>takes a long time before it even shows</p>
<p>up on enzyme tests you&rsquo;re you in your</p>
<p>mind you&rsquo;re going hey my friend lost 20</p>
<p>pounds I&rsquo;m not losing 20 pounds and all</p>
<p>of a sudden it doesn&rsquo;t work and you get</p>
<p>frustrated so the duration of time you</p>
<p>have the problem you need to actually</p>
<p>increase your estimation of how long</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to take and that could be off</p>
<p>by a big factor so some people to really</p>
<p>get over the insulin resistance could</p>
<p>take a year or two years so just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>give up have patience that&rsquo;s why we call</p>
<p>you a patient and that&rsquo;s why you sit in</p>
<p>a waiting room the other thing I want to</p>
<p>differentiate is the difference between</p>
<p>fat and atrophy how many of you have are</p>
<p>going through or been through this thing</p>
<p>called menopause okay so you may find</p>
<p>that things start shifting it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>wait a second what is going off my body</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had people come in and there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>their whole body just falls apart right</p>
<p>after menopause so with the adrenal</p>
<p>glands there they kind of act as a back</p>
<p>up to the ovaries so they produce the</p>
<p>same hormones so if the adrenal glands</p>
<p>are going into menopause fatigue then</p>
<p>everything is exaggerated and then you</p>
<p>end up with all sorts of problems</p>
<p>especially atrophy which is a loss of a</p>
<p>muscle you lose your muscle and so it</p>
<p>looks like fat but it&rsquo;s just a loss of</p>
<p>muscle it&rsquo;s flabby its loss of collagen</p>
<p>and then you do the keto in a minute</p>
<p>fasting and it doesn&rsquo;t get you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>lose the weight right away it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on so you may have to build</p>
<p>up those muscles and that takes a good</p>
<p>amount of time it could take months even</p>
<p>a couple years FYI and you do have to</p>
<p>add extra</p>
<p>sighs to that you have to work those and</p>
<p>give it a long time just realize if it</p>
<p>is atrophy it&rsquo;s going to take some time</p>
<p>but you can undo that also you have to</p>
<p>work on the adrenal glands I will touch</p>
<p>on that a little bit but I have a lot of</p>
<p>videos on adrenal gland but atrophy is a</p>
<p>real key thing okay we have this thing</p>
<p>called stress one thing you need to know</p>
<p>is that a lot of stress accumulates</p>
<p>pretty much all stress accumulates in</p>
<p>your body you&rsquo;re one big bucket of</p>
<p>stress and so it builds up and then it</p>
<p>it wears down the ability of your</p>
<p>adrenals to handle and tolerate stress</p>
<p>how do you know if you have an adrenal</p>
<p>problem well one way is how is your</p>
<p>tolerance to stress</p>
<p>can you handle babysitting a lot of</p>
<p>small children and a day care center</p>
<p>over 8 hours without wigging it out if</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t handle that we know you have a</p>
<p>problem with your drain holes it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically the adrenal strength well is a</p>
<p>good indicator of like how much stress</p>
<p>you have in your body</p>
<p>now there&rsquo;s a couple things that you may</p>
<p>not associate with why you&rsquo;re not losing</p>
<p>weight one is old injuries the</p>
<p>accumulation of old injuries and I have</p>
<p>videos on this but it&rsquo;s something a lot</p>
<p>of people don&rsquo;t talk about I talked to</p>
<p>some people I talked to you last night</p>
<p>and there was a couple of the people one</p>
<p>lady had a whiplash where is she ok</p>
<p>great I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that can you</p>
<p>come up here can you come up here and</p>
<p>can someone bring that chair up here I</p>
<p>want to do a little demonstration of</p>
<p>what we can do for an old injury one of</p>
<p>the things that I did my clinic is I did</p>
<p>a lot of manual work on people and want</p>
<p>to give you some pointers on what to do</p>
<p>so you had an injury a car accident</p>
<p>right and it was a whiplash right and so</p>
<p>what happened someone hit you from</p>
<p>behind and so the first thing that</p>
<p>happens when you get hit from behind is</p>
<p>a your neck goes back and that tears the</p>
<p>ligaments in the front part ok so if I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing acupressure or any type of</p>
<p>manipulation I don&rsquo;t want to be doing</p>
<p>this motion to put her into the injury I</p>
<p>want to go the opposite way so and then</p>
<p>you have some sleeping problems right so</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t sleep then you&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to lose weight because it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>increase stress so there&rsquo;s a couple</p>
<p>little things that you can do and you</p>
<p>can actually I show this in the webinar</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s on webinar and stress but I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>going to give you some tips ok so if if</p>
<p>someone has a whiplash from behind you</p>
<p>can basically do a stretch and reverse</p>
<p>it by pressing up this way and I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>going to just stretch underneath here a</p>
<p>little bit forward I&rsquo;m just reversing</p>
<p>the whiplash and again I just wanted to</p>
<p>show you a couple little things because</p>
<p>last night when I was talking to people</p>
<p>there are so many people that how cold</p>
<p>injury is especially to the head and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some cool things that you can do</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m just pulling up it&rsquo;s called the</p>
<p>occiput and I would normally do this you</p>
<p>know a couple minutes but what happens</p>
<p>it actually gives the person a sense of</p>
<p>relief I don&rsquo;t know what do you feel</p>
<p>like right now feel a little better</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s something there&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>tool that I have that you can do this on</p>
<p>yourself you could have someone do this</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ll find that just a little bit</p>
<p>of work like that will actually just</p>
<p>relax the body because when you go to</p>
<p>sleep at night there&rsquo;s certain parts of</p>
<p>your body that won&rsquo;t turn off like</p>
<p>either your Nexis stiff your head&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stiff or energetic or your your head is</p>
<p>your chest is like energetic or your</p>
<p>legs are restless and you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>go to sleep and you&rsquo;re trying it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>working</p>
<p>like Saturday no Friday night I&rsquo;m trying</p>
<p>to sleep I wake up at 2 o&rsquo;clock in the</p>
<p>morning going through and my mind is</p>
<p>like going through what I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>talk about right from 2:00 to 6:00 but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s different this but old injuries</p>
<p>can actually keep your body in a state</p>
<p>of tension and stress and heaviness and</p>
<p>it can prevent you from going to sleep</p>
<p>so I have people write out all your old</p>
<p>injuries and then we kind of do some</p>
<p>work on them so that would be one thing</p>
<p>have you ever had any head injuries yeah</p>
<p>now okay so here&rsquo;s the principle of what</p>
<p>to do with old injuries it&rsquo;s really cool</p>
<p>like let&rsquo;s say she one of the gals I</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t bring her out but she got hit with</p>
<p>a baseball right here well guess what I</p>
<p>found over the years that can really</p>
<p>keep people from relaxing and sleeping</p>
<p>old head injuries to the skull injuries</p>
<p>so like hit by a baseball that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>traumatic so what you do is there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>principle you work on the opposite some</p>
<p>of you already know this because you saw</p>
<p>my videos but you work on the opposite</p>
<p>you can actually release it I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna get into why it works you just</p>
<p>need to try it so if she got hit right</p>
<p>here with a baseball I will press on the</p>
<p>mirror image side right here and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna massage it what&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>about this is when you press on this</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll hurt twice as much so go light and</p>
<p>like what is this side here this is the</p>
<p>good side but you would massage it and</p>
<p>maybe a couple minutes each day and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna find that it releases the</p>
<p>tension in the head just have to try it</p>
<p>it does work so I just want to show you</p>
<p>that little thing thank you for coming</p>
<p>up okay and then another thing and I</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t spend too much time but I want to</p>
<p>I want to see who is it does anyone have</p>
<p>any pain okay you a pain where where</p>
<p>what what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>okay come up here alright so I just want</p>
<p>to show you a really cool very cool</p>
<p>technique on pain and you can do this to</p>
<p>yourself if you like to put yourself in</p>
<p>to more pain</p>
<p>I have a lot of videos I probably have a</p>
<p>video in every part of the body and how</p>
<p>to do this you can just search it but I</p>
<p>just want to show you a really cool</p>
<p>thing that is not taught in school but</p>
<p>it works and yeah take your boots off</p>
<p>make yourself comfortable so what kind</p>
<p>of injury did you have how ok so does</p>
<p>that kind of affect your ability to walk</p>
<p>yeah so that will stop exercise so this</p>
<p>is a really easy one because what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do is we&rsquo;re gonna press on the</p>
<p>opposite side ok so if I grab her foot</p>
<p>here and I press right here now I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna press really light because this is</p>
<p>gonna be very tender the more damages on</p>
<p>this side the more tender is gonna work</p>
<p>on that side tell me when I find you</p>
<p>find it good morning I&rsquo;m barely touching</p>
<p>I try to get a job as an interrogator</p>
<p>but I press too hard so I became a</p>
<p>health care practitioner now one of the</p>
<p>things that you would do is I would just</p>
<p>work on this to her tolerance I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>watching the eyeballs make sure it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t pop out and just work this out</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just like this is just something</p>
<p>you can do to start stripping down like</p>
<p>old injuries and kind of clearing those</p>
<p>out now the other thing is you want to</p>
<p>do is I know that she&rsquo;s been limping</p>
<p>probably on the opposite side so she has</p>
<p>a lot of tension in the calf on this</p>
<p>side here so you&rsquo;d also relax you want</p>
<p>to really work on the calf and this is</p>
<p>going to be like like that so I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>going to very gently just kind of work</p>
<p>through that for about an hour just tell</p>
<p>me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m standing over here since</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t kick me on that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;d work on the calf so anytime you</p>
<p>have like a foot problem you work on</p>
<p>that the calf on the opposite side it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a great little trick but it works like</p>
<p>magic if you have a knee problem you</p>
<p>work on the opposite muscle on the up</p>
<p>cycle that&rsquo;s limping so any problem here</p>
<p>you can work on this these are all the</p>
<p>videos but it&rsquo;s a great technique to</p>
<p>quickly give the person relief so I just</p>
<p>did a tiny little bit I don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll feel better but we&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>good thank you</p>
<p>you are healed so you got you a pain you</p>
<p>have old injuries and a lot of people</p>
<p>had old injuries I&rsquo;ve had old injuries</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why I developed a technique</p>
<p>what about what about people can people</p>
<p>stress you out occasionally people</p>
<p>stressed out especially the one that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called the like the passive aggressive</p>
<p>they call them under miners they&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>person that gave you a compliment but</p>
<p>they followed up with a sharp critical</p>
<p>comment how many of you know anyone like</p>
<p>that these guys everyone knows these</p>
<p>guys really jack up your adrenals okay</p>
<p>they really get you they&rsquo;ll say hey you</p>
<p>got a haircut that&rsquo;s really nice did you</p>
<p>get to that cheap cuts</p>
<p>they bring you up and they bring you</p>
<p>down oh that&rsquo;s a nice sweater it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>on sale my ID this guy who said oh you</p>
<p>graduated congratulations why didn&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>want to become a real doctor I was like</p>
<p>ooh so what these peoples they try to</p>
<p>make nothing of you they try to make you</p>
<p>feel like you&rsquo;re a criminal so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just realized is the two types people</p>
<p>bring you up and the other people bring</p>
<p>you down those guys you seem to avoid</p>
<p>them but there is a technique that I</p>
<p>used to get even get revenge you guys</p>
<p>want to know it okay it&rsquo;s a great just</p>
<p>makes me feel better so if they start</p>
<p>going in onto that because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>usually kind of critical and then they</p>
<p>think oh now I&rsquo;m your best friend right</p>
<p>so that that whole thing so I will</p>
<p>quickly want to get them out of my space</p>
<p>so what you do is you just don&rsquo;t respond</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t answer them just look closely on</p>
<p>their face and go</p>
<p>is that been growing is that how long</p>
<p>how long have you had that that little</p>
<p>blemish there yeah you should get that</p>
<p>checked out to be the liver so they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be in the bathroom for hours looking at</p>
<p>this and you get them out of your space</p>
<p>it works like a charm</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done it many times</p>
<p>[Applause]</p>
<p>when people have losses for example they</p>
<p>actually can gain weight ooh it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>sad fat and in Germany they call it</p>
<p>grief fat I don&rsquo;t know the word for it</p>
<p>but grief fat I don&rsquo;t if you&rsquo;ve heard of</p>
<p>that but you have losses right and loss</p>
<p>of loved one don&rsquo;t you start gaining on</p>
<p>this way because the spike in cortisol</p>
<p>so if someone is stuck in a a loss or</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re basically stuck on a problem a</p>
<p>chronic problem it&rsquo;s worried about it oh</p>
<p>my gosh that&rsquo;s gonna raise cortisol so</p>
<p>the best thing to do is go for long</p>
<p>walks like I&rsquo;m talking an hour and a</p>
<p>half because walking is increases oxygen</p>
<p>with low stress and you get space don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like have your friend here that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>Underminer with you walking was there</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re being constantly being chopped</p>
<p>down chopped liver so be by yourself</p>
<p>just walk and just get space it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the best thing because when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re stuck in that trauma it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just kind of like your space kind</p>
<p>of goes in so that&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>the other thing is um there&rsquo;s a couple</p>
<p>places in your body where you tend to</p>
<p>hold stress and I need to find someone</p>
<p>who just can&rsquo;t sleep okay let&rsquo;s bring</p>
<p>you up don&rsquo;t worry I&rsquo;m going to show you</p>
<p>this and you can do it in the person</p>
<p>next to you when we&rsquo;re done</p>
<p>this is a technique that looks really</p>
<p>simple but it&rsquo;s really effective for</p>
<p>sleep Wow can we have an easier case now</p>
<p>let me just take these so I can see what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do to you</p>
<p>now what happens there&rsquo;s two parts of</p>
<p>the nervous system it&rsquo;s called the</p>
<p>autonomic nervous system you have the</p>
<p>sympathetic and the parasympathetic the</p>
<p>flight-or-fight or the rest rest and</p>
<p>digest okay so the parasympathetic</p>
<p>nervous system is controls rest and the</p>
<p>sleep centers are located in the</p>
<p>brainstem so there&rsquo;s some cool little</p>
<p>pressure points that you can work on to</p>
<p>just kind of relax those points okay and</p>
<p>so what you do is you take your hand I</p>
<p>like to take the thumb and my middle</p>
<p>finger I&rsquo;m not flipping you off right</p>
<p>here and there&rsquo;s a tool that I have that</p>
<p>is I built that looks like my hand it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a little tripod a lot of you have it and</p>
<p>you can use that to lay back on a tall</p>
<p>back chair I wish I would have brought</p>
<p>one and that&rsquo;s just that&rsquo;s why I use</p>
<p>that every night don&rsquo;t I care yeah I</p>
<p>pretty much use that thing and I go to</p>
<p>sleep like within like 30 seconds I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>out you know so what you do is you got</p>
<p>the back of the skull you take your two</p>
<p>fingers and take these two fingers and</p>
<p>just drop them below the skull you can</p>
<p>do this as someone or you can use that</p>
<p>device and then you apply pressure</p>
<p>symmetrically right underneath the skull</p>
<p>without messing up their hair and then</p>
<p>what you do is you just yeah you just</p>
<p>hold this these points for like a minute</p>
<p>and the person will feel really relaxed</p>
<p>the only time you wouldn&rsquo;t want to do</p>
<p>this is if they have a like a whiplash</p>
<p>injury from behind like you you want to</p>
<p>go the other way so if you had a</p>
<p>rear-end collision this is the one that</p>
<p>you probably don&rsquo;t want to do have you</p>
<p>ever had a rear-end collision</p>
<p>okay so I&rsquo;m just holding this</p>
<p>and I used to do this all the time in my</p>
<p>clinic and people just like literally</p>
<p>start snoring and I&rsquo;m just relaxing the</p>
<p>muscles underneath the top of the the</p>
<p>top of the neck underneath the skull and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about kind of needs someone that is</p>
<p>kind of bold so I can show you back here</p>
<p>yeah I just want to show people the</p>
<p>location of this because they need to</p>
<p>see this now is this feeling any any</p>
<p>different yeah you&rsquo;re gonna feel like a</p>
<p>wave through the whole body this is what</p>
<p>this is great right before you go to</p>
<p>sleep okay thank you thank you so much</p>
<p>so you didn&rsquo;t need them we can kill two</p>
<p>birds one stone handled okay this one</p>
<p>right here look at my thumb and my</p>
<p>fingers coming right underneath here and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pressing this way I&rsquo;m just holding</p>
<p>the forehead and pressing in this way</p>
<p>this is all on video guys so you can</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called a stress webinar but you</p>
<p>press this and you hold that so let me</p>
<p>just have you sit right here and I just</p>
<p>kind of come in here and I just hold</p>
<p>this for two minutes but it kind of</p>
<p>takes the tension I mean a lot of people</p>
<p>have stress in their upper part of their</p>
<p>neck but this is great for sleep it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great sleep technique</p>
<p>also the breathing centers are there too</p>
<p>does it feel any different</p>
<p>good okay I just want to do a little bit</p>
<p>cuz of time but thank you for coming up</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s that technique</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s you would also you can work on</p>
<p>the abdomen through these points there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some techniques there there&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>seven different things you can do I do</p>
<p>them every night before I go to bed</p>
<p>Karen might be watching TV I&rsquo;m already</p>
<p>out I&rsquo;m just and she does massage my</p>
<p>shoulders and by the time I start I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like oh so stress is a really key point</p>
<p>to overcome so you want to do various</p>
<p>things you want to do handle any cause</p>
<p>for the stress if it&rsquo;s a that</p>
<p>personality for people some problem you</p>
<p>have to improve that somehow also</p>
<p>physical old injuries pain inflammation</p>
<p>one of the best remedies for</p>
<p>inflammation is intermittent fasting but</p>
<p>as a coping mechanism stinging nettle</p>
<p>root is one of the best herbs for</p>
<p>inflammation fYI I&rsquo;ve given you guys a</p>
<p>chart on some good remedies and a</p>
<p>checklist as well you can look at that</p>
<p>later</p>
<p>now also people that had like severe</p>
<p>losses and things you have a 21 times</p>
<p>increase of getting a risk of getting a</p>
<p>heart attack so it really affects the</p>
<p>body it increases the risk of getting an</p>
<p>infection and the gain weight and then</p>
<p>develop insulin resistance virus has</p>
<p>come out of remission when you go</p>
<p>through stresses I interviewed a lot of</p>
<p>people that autoimmune diseases and I</p>
<p>said what happened just before it nearly</p>
<p>most of the time it&rsquo;s either some stress</p>
<p>loss divorce or some traumatic thing so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s that huge connection that no</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s really addressing so here you are</p>
<p>trying to fix it nutritionally when it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really a stress trigger you got to work</p>
<p>on the Drina &rsquo;ls so I&rsquo;m trying to expand</p>
<p>your viewpoint there&rsquo;s other other</p>
<p>things</p>
<p>to look at what happens when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>stressed what do people eat when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>under stress this stuff right well so</p>
<p>they eat sugar right because stress</p>
<p>sugar makes you feel better</p>
<p>sugar actually increases beta endorphins</p>
<p>beta endorphins are 30 times stronger</p>
<p>than morphine for pain relief and they</p>
<p>reduce stress sugar also increases</p>
<p>dopamine maybe for just a minute but it</p>
<p>makes you feel better so the combination</p>
<p>of eating sugar for a beta endorphin and</p>
<p>bilk mean will increase make you feel</p>
<p>confident decrease pain stress socially</p>
<p>connected you&rsquo;re going to feel hopeful</p>
<p>and you can have a pleasure sensation</p>
<p>and feel a little motivated this is why</p>
<p>people are eating sugar they&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to solve a problem with a certain</p>
<p>sensation but it&rsquo;s kind of crazy because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re out you&rsquo;re gonna add sugar for a</p>
<p>solution like it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m gonna put</p>
<p>gasoline on a fire</p>
<p>to get rid of the fire because the</p>
<p>problem is the rebound effect you feel</p>
<p>temporarily better and then you feel a</p>
<p>lot worse and the longer you do it the</p>
<p>more that these effects go away so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a bit of a trap so again we want to use</p>
<p>the tools keto and then fasting to</p>
<p>overcome these problems vitamin b1 will</p>
<p>really help especially if you&rsquo;re kind of</p>
<p>in that trap because you&rsquo;re depleting b1</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re eating the sugar and you put</p>
<p>that in there it gives you some nice</p>
<p>relief pretty quick there&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>great book Kindle it&rsquo;s very expensive</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like $79 Kindle book but it&rsquo;s worth</p>
<p>it dr. Derek long snail MD Derek long</p>
<p>snail and this whole book is on thymine</p>
<p>unbelievable book fascinating if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>into by me which I&rsquo;m into so I knew you</p>
<p>can ask the name just go under Amazon</p>
<p>and type his name and you&rsquo;ll find it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s under thymine time</p>
<p>deficiencies that&rsquo;s b1 Derek long still</p>
<p>Derek yeah now a higher fat diet will</p>
<p>also help with stress reduction it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna feed the hormones it&rsquo;ll help give</p>
<p>you DHA omega-3 fatty acids so this is</p>
<p>why keto is great this there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>other techniques with acupressure that</p>
<p>you can just watch us online but if you</p>
<p>actually go through this you are going</p>
<p>to sleep really good there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>else that I also have done that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never talked about until now because I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t want to create a video and just</p>
<p>tell everyone all the secrets but let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see who there was a diabetic there was a</p>
<p>type one there was where was she okay</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s come up here I wanted to show you</p>
<p>this technique if you take someone that</p>
<p>has like a known blood sugar problem I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to show you what I&rsquo;ve done with</p>
<p>great success but I&rsquo;m gonna have you</p>
<p>experiment yourself and I&rsquo;m just gonna</p>
<p>have you sit right here don&rsquo;t try this</p>
<p>at home</p>
<p>no so if you think about it and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to show you something about</p>
<p>visceral massage you know you work on</p>
<p>your muscles but really rarely anyone</p>
<p>works on the organs right yeah you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>massage your pancreas every day do you</p>
<p>so I had a just a crazy idea I said what</p>
<p>would happen let&rsquo;s just check your blood</p>
<p>sugar so the scale comes in this is many</p>
<p>years ago and I said let&rsquo;s check your</p>
<p>blood Sugar&rsquo;s is well over 200 I said</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna massage your pancreas</p>
<p>which is under the left ribcage</p>
<p>I just later down I just started</p>
<p>massaging it for like two minutes i</p>
<p>rechecked the blood sugars it came down</p>
<p>to 120 and I&rsquo;m like what I try their gun</p>
<p>now there&rsquo;s not any Studies on this that</p>
<p>I know of but it&rsquo;s just something if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a diabetic or a blood sugar</p>
<p>problems experiment yourself with your</p>
<p>keto mojo testing strips and you just go</p>
<p>on there and see if it doesn&rsquo;t help you</p>
<p>it kind of activates that plan you can</p>
<p>do the same thing with</p>
<ul>
<li>but you would basically take your hand</li>
</ul>
<p>and just kind of press through here and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that the person has this</p>
<p>great sense of like their doing and also</p>
<p>they just so get this Wow I just feel</p>
<p>really relaxing so I&rsquo;m like why not the</p>
<p>pancreas is like working like crazy</p>
<p>because it has 150 pounds of sugar per</p>
<p>year to deal with you just work on that</p>
<p>and it actually gives the body a sense</p>
<p>of relief it&rsquo;s just something I would</p>
<p>recommend to try out an experiment and</p>
<p>to see if it helps you but you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>increasing the communication into that</p>
<p>organ that&rsquo;s what massages this you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting the getting more circulation</p>
<p>into the area it&rsquo;s real simple it might</p>
<p>sound weird but it works so try it the</p>
<p>other thing you can do for pain a lot of</p>
<p>people have pain that&rsquo;s referred from</p>
<p>something else I found the top thing is</p>
<p>the gallbladder I&rsquo;m not talking about a</p>
<p>stone in the ball but are just a</p>
<p>irritated gallbladder that&rsquo;s congested</p>
<p>where is the pain gonna go on the right</p>
<p>side right through here and the back of</p>
<p>the scapula how many of you have tension</p>
<p>right here yeah look at that let&rsquo;s use</p>
<p>the gallbladder when you do health</p>
<p>Aikido and intimate fasting that should</p>
<p>go away but you&rsquo;d want a massage on the</p>
<p>right side underneath the right ribcage</p>
<p>I have a ton of videos on this if you</p>
<p>hold pressure cuz I had a gallbladder</p>
<p>for 12 years I didn&rsquo;t know I called</p>
<p>about a problem I didn&rsquo;t know what it</p>
<p>was so I would get this thing hammered</p>
<p>and because there was a chiropractor I</p>
<p>would have that thing adjusted probably</p>
<p>over adjusted everything everyone and</p>
<p>just would keep coming back because the</p>
<p>pain was referred so once I of course</p>
<p>then I years later I changed the diet</p>
<p>and then it totally solved but you could</p>
<p>massage the gallbladder points and give</p>
<p>a lot of relief up through here so very</p>
<p>important point for pain especially</p>
<p>people that say I have fibromyalgia but</p>
<p>you ask them is it on the right side</p>
<p>only they go yeah how did you know</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have fibromyalgia it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the gallbladder so the problem is people</p>
<p>eat six times a day and they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not giving in the gallbladder a chance</p>
<p>to reset</p>
<p>so I just wanted to show you that just</p>
<p>to kind of give you a little tip thank</p>
<p>you very much also thank you</p>
<p>[Applause]</p>
<p>especially headaches on the right side</p>
<p>too that&rsquo;s all gallbladder even stuff</p>
<p>that shoots down here I actually invited</p>
<p>like six people from my city to do a</p>
<p>video and I&rsquo;m gonna I&rsquo;m gonna do a video</p>
<p>in pain I think it was like five out of</p>
<p>six it came from the gallbladder cuz I</p>
<p>was working on the pain it didn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>and I work on the gallbladder and bam</p>
<p>completely went away so very common all</p>
<p>right so sleep how many of you have a</p>
<p>sleep problem Wow sleeping is a barrier</p>
<p>to a lot of problems especially recovery</p>
<p>and healing</p>
<p>what causes sleep problems well it could</p>
<p>be your bladder and that&rsquo;s insulin</p>
<p>resistance because diabetics usually</p>
<p>have problems with fluids at night and</p>
<p>they pee a lot more frequent so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another issue that&rsquo;s going to be solved</p>
<p>when you do healthy keto and in fasting</p>
<p>stress all the techniques that I said</p>
<p>from stress aerobic exercise walking b1</p>
<p>the manual type work massage all are</p>
<p>great for sleeping because they get rid</p>
<p>of that issue and also the acupressure</p>
<p>point in the back of the neck you should</p>
<p>sleep like a baby when you do that</p>
<p>of course babies are crying all night</p>
<p>but now as far as sleep goes I found</p>
<p>that you may want to try sleeping on</p>
<p>your right side that seems to work</p>
<p>better for a lot of people why because</p>
<p>the liver is on the right side and if</p>
<p>you have a fatty liver it may just be</p>
<p>heavier than it should be so if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sleeping on the left side with a fatty</p>
<p>liver that&rsquo;s compressing the heart</p>
<p>you might feel uncomfortable so try to</p>
<p>sleep on the right side so the heart can</p>
<p>sit on the liver and it seems people</p>
<p>seem to do better on the right side when</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re sleeping</p>
<p>not everyone avoiding excess protein</p>
<p>how many find that when you eat a</p>
<p>texas-style steak before you go to bed</p>
<p>that may interfere with your sleep yeah</p>
<p>too much protein can act as a stimulant</p>
<p>and you might just want to adjust that</p>
<p>as well because you know sometimes if</p>
<p>you that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;d like to consume the</p>
<p>vegetables first then the protein</p>
<p>because if you have the chicken wings</p>
<p>first like my son will just eat like a</p>
<p>whole egg like a ton of them and then</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no room roof room left for the</p>
<p>salad so you want the salad and then the</p>
<p>chicken wings but the too much protein</p>
<p>will act as a stimulant I also found</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a technique that you can do</p>
<p>breathing when you&rsquo;re when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sleeping so let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re laying</p>
<p>there and you&rsquo;re not able to sleep and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just thinking about stuff focus</p>
<p>on your breathing and I&rsquo;m going to show</p>
<p>you how to do that you can actively</p>
<p>affect the autonomic nervous system by</p>
<p>breathing consciously was five seconds</p>
<p>slowly in and five select seconds slowly</p>
<p>out people that have stress they tend to</p>
<p>breathe like this the exhalation is a</p>
<p>lot shorter than inhalation so if you</p>
<p>slow that down just by focusing on the</p>
<p>breathing slowly in through the nose and</p>
<p>then slowly out and keep those even I</p>
<p>find that works for sleeping you&rsquo;ll next</p>
<p>thing you know you&rsquo;ll be waking up in</p>
<p>the morning it&rsquo;s just another little</p>
<p>thing that you can do</p>
<p>Oh also avoid watching the news before</p>
<p>you go to bed or in general actually</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even watch the news I like to dim</p>
<p>the lights before I go to bed so I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have all those lights around the best</p>
<p>light actually is candlelight I mean</p>
<p>this that the yellow and orange that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really good for the receptors and also</p>
<p>the melatonin stimulation which it</p>
<p>actually stimulates sleep so darkness</p>
<p>stimulates that so if you&rsquo;re in a bright</p>
<p>light and then you try to go to bed like</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t give you a chance your</p>
<p>melatonin to kick in there also</p>
<p>EMF like keeping this when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sleeping right here is bad so all these</p>
<p>electrical devices get them out of the</p>
<p>area of your body when you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>sleep because they can affect you how</p>
<p>many of you do a lot of computer work</p>
<p>yeah so do I so if you&rsquo;re sitting for</p>
<p>them computer and then you try to go to</p>
<p>bed it&rsquo;s like it doesn&rsquo;t work so you</p>
<p>need to break it up and go outside and</p>
<p>go just get some space sometimes I have</p>
<p>a really good sleep aid that a lot of</p>
<p>you are on that works good that works on</p>
<p>the adrenal but sometimes you need a</p>
<p>little extra calcium so if you&rsquo;re a head</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t always turn off you might want</p>
<p>to add a little calcium I like calcium</p>
<p>or at 8 that&rsquo;s a really good one I take</p>
<p>it only you know a few times a week if I</p>
<p>need it but it tends to help you go to</p>
<p>sleep I don&rsquo;t normally recommend calcium</p>
<p>supplements but for that one</p>
<p>occasionally I do also caffeine if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing too much caffeine or tea</p>
<p>that is going to keep you up at night so</p>
<p>try to cut down if you have sleep and</p>
<p>see if it doesn&rsquo;t help you</p>
<p>I do coffee but just a small one one I</p>
<p>do one because I abused it in college I</p>
<p>used to have Cuban coffee</p>
<p>lots of it this is why I&rsquo;m doing this</p>
<p>Eman right now because I got I got burnt</p>
<p>out I think most of you probably have</p>
<p>had experienced we you you had a health</p>
<p>problem that actually motivated you do</p>
<p>keto it in a minute fasting right yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s something that</p>
<p>you just didn&rsquo;t you just weren&rsquo;t feeling</p>
<p>great and decided to do it something</p>
<p>like I was very very sick myself if you</p>
<p>were a past athlete how many of her past</p>
<p>athletes athletic okay and then all of a</p>
<p>sudden you you do this intense with</p>
<p>exercise I was a wrestler and then you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t work out in your 30s 40s and 50s</p>
<p>then you decided to work out when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>60 right the the mitochondria generate</p>
<p>this huge machine and then you stop</p>
<p>depleting the energy so for you athletes</p>
<p>you need to continue to exercise to get</p>
<p>that energy out you can&rsquo;t just like work</p>
<p>at the computer and try to go to bed you</p>
<p>have to workout to get the energy</p>
<p>extracted from your body</p>
<p>macros hidden carbs yogurt 10 grams of</p>
<p>sugar that&rsquo;s some plain that&rsquo;s too high</p>
<p>alcohol could definitely provide too</p>
<p>much sugar and carb for your your liver</p>
<p>coconut water way too much sugar fruit</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry and sugar alcohols could</p>
<p>interfere with your ability to really</p>
<p>get in ketosis especially maltitol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the worst it is a glycemic index</p>
<p>of like 55 that&rsquo;s just underneath sugar</p>
<p>you want to play with your vegetables</p>
<p>sometimes if you have too much</p>
<p>vegetables you don&rsquo;t have enough</p>
<p>microbes that&rsquo;s gonna create fluid</p>
<p>retention and bloating and that&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>figure with your sleep and also you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna feel like you&rsquo;re just bloated all</p>
<p>the time so adjust them lower or higher</p>
<p>depending on your ability to digest them</p>
<p>but I do consume I find the days that I</p>
<p>consume enough vegetables I sleep better</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s I think it&rsquo;s the potassium and</p>
<p>magnesium so potassium is a</p>
<p>physiological tranquilizer it relaxes</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>so does magnate magnesium as far as your</p>
<p>protein you have to try experiment if</p>
<p>you do too much you can affect your</p>
<p>sleep if you do too little you can might</p>
<p>feel weak and tired so personally I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>180 pounds I need about 8 ounces per day</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s my optimum number you got to</p>
<p>play around that until experiment could</p>
<p>be a little less a little bit more but</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s a little different fat macros</p>
<p>when you would get into keto and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>adapting to fat burning for a period of</p>
<p>time and you&rsquo;re not losing weight if you</p>
<p>plateau it&rsquo;s probably because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing too much dietary fat and your body</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have to burn its own fat because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re turning the ketones from the</p>
<p>dietary fat so you may want to just cut</p>
<p>down the fat so we can force your body</p>
<p>to burn its own fat and that includes</p>
<p>the the exogenous ketones because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna kind of replace what your body</p>
<p>should be burning if you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>lose weight and so I found a good number</p>
<p>to go below as 75 gram</p>
<p>maybe 60 to 75 grams if you cut it down</p>
<p>right around there you&rsquo;re gonna find</p>
<p>your weight loss will kick in there the</p>
<p>transit time for your digestion the time</p>
<p>that the food goes all the way through</p>
<p>your system is between 36 and 40 hours</p>
<p>so by the time your stomach takes 4 to 5</p>
<p>hours to get the food through so no one</p>
<p>will very few the average person does</p>
<p>not they don&rsquo;t give their stomach a</p>
<p>chance to let the food go through so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re crammed and food down there down</p>
<p>the pipe when the food doesn&rsquo;t even get</p>
<p>through the stomach right so we never</p>
<p>get a system the system to reboot that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why in a minute fasting is so helpful</p>
<p>for the digestive system so there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>thing called prolonged fasting and then</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll I know I&rsquo;m going a little bit too</p>
<p>long but this is important prolonged</p>
<p>fasting is a really important tool to</p>
<p>jumpstart not just weight loss but</p>
<p>health problems I&rsquo;m talking about going</p>
<p>48 hours 72 hours or 21 hours right or</p>
<p>21 days so what&rsquo;s that 23 days yeah so</p>
<p>you can create some really cool effects</p>
<p>on your body with stem cell with healing</p>
<p>with weight loss with metabolism with</p>
<p>growth hormone but here&rsquo;s the thing I</p>
<p>would recommend letting your body tell</p>
<p>you when you&rsquo;re ready for that just kind</p>
<p>of go as long as you can and just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>going there thinking I&rsquo;m gonna go 21</p>
<p>days when you&rsquo;re dying at the day -</p>
<p>because you have to work up to it</p>
<p>so you gradually work this out maybe</p>
<p>once a month or once every other month</p>
<p>you do a prolonged fast and you keep</p>
<p>working in that because you want to</p>
<p>build up your your nutrient reserve</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re drawing from your</p>
<p>nutrient reserve and I do recommend not</p>
<p>just doing water I do recommend</p>
<p>supplements electrolytes when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing fasting because I&rsquo;ve had a couple</p>
<p>people just pass out and hit their head</p>
<p>on something because they didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>enough electrolytes so we want the</p>
<p>potassium we want the sea salt I would</p>
<p>recommend that when you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>prolonged fasting and when you come off</p>
<p>prolonged fasting you want to do</p>
<p>refeeding slowly so you want it you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to just eat a big huge meal</p>
<p>after 21 days have a little bit of</p>
<p>food wait a little bit a little bit of</p>
<p>food wait a little bit and then</p>
<p>gradually introduced the food or you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>feel that you&rsquo;ll be sick because your</p>
<p>system is not ready for that if you have</p>
<p>a fatty liver that can prevent your</p>
<p>ability to get rid of insulin resistance</p>
<p>so choline is a really good supplement</p>
<p>to handle fatty liver I mean you can</p>
<p>actually pull the fat off within a</p>
<p>couple months with choline some other</p>
<p>things that are good for insulin</p>
<p>resistance apple cider vinegar is really</p>
<p>good cinnamon</p>
<p>vitamin D all this is in your notes by</p>
<p>the way I&rsquo;ve given you guys a checklist</p>
<p>to follow so you don&rsquo;t even need to</p>
<p>write it down a couple last things and</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;ll be quiet</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had people add a probiotic and also</p>
<p>they started losing weight because they</p>
<p>need to they that was people that are</p>
<p>actually overweight and thin they have</p>
<p>different microbial balances they have</p>
<p>different types of microbes in their gut</p>
<p>but adding a good-enough microbe and I</p>
<p>like the one that I like is it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>effective microbes I&rsquo;m gonna be doing a</p>
<p>video on it so I can give you more data</p>
<p>but the effective microbes is kind of a</p>
<p>unique non-dairy type of flora that</p>
<p>really fortifies the intestines and I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>had many people lose weight just by</p>
<p>adding a probiotic some people you have</p>
<p>to add a prebiotic like the sauerkraut</p>
<p>fermented that gives you the probiotic</p>
<p>and the prebiotic at the same exact time</p>
<p>last thing and then I&rsquo;m done</p>
<p>hidden antibiotics they find that when</p>
<p>you when you&rsquo;re at an antibiotic that</p>
<p>kills out the bacteria you gain weight</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why it farmers give antibiotics</p>
<p>to help fatten up the chickens and the</p>
<p>cattle things like that so you want to</p>
<p>consume organic foods or animals that</p>
<p>have not been given antibiotics but one</p>
<p>of the biggest hidden antibiotics is</p>
<p>glyphosate which is the Roundup Ready</p>
<p>from GMO it&rsquo;s patented as an antibiotic</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ve all been exposed to that so</p>
<p>again organic food because the GMO stuff</p>
<p>is like you just taking antibiotics and</p>
<p>that could be the reason why a lot of</p>
<p>people are getting fat</p>
<p>and then one last thing because I must</p>
<p>forgot dr. Berg app I just released it</p>
<p>you can download it it&rsquo;s if you haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>downloaded and then one no thank you so</p>
<p>much you know and we&rsquo;ll be doing a Q&amp;A</p>
<p>after the next two speakers thank you</p>
<p>[Applause]</p>
