<p>[upbeat music]</p>
<p>Uno, dos, tres, quatro.</p>
<p>Tim: The new iPhone SE!</p>
<p>From the very beginning, we designed iPhone SE to include</p>
<p>some of our most advanced features and technologies,</p>
<p>while delivering the iPhone experience at an incredible price.</p>
<p>This is important for our existing users who want a smaller iPhone</p>
<p>and a great value.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also been an incredibly popular model with new iPhone users.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re continuing to add new users to iPhone</p>
<p>at a faster pace.</p>
<p>In fact, this past fall, we&rsquo;ve added more new users to the iPhone 13 lineup</p>
<p>than in each of the previous five launches.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re excited for the iPhone SE to build on this momentum.</p>
<p>Now here&rsquo;s Francesca to tell you more.</p>
<p>[exciting electronic music]</p>
<p>Francesca: At the heart of iPhone SE is A15 Bionic,</p>
<p>the same chip as in iPhone 13.</p>
<p>Bringing this level of performance to our most affordable phone</p>
<p>is something only Apple can do.</p>
<p>A15 Bionic makes nearly every experience better,</p>
<p>from simple things like launching apps and scrolling through photos,</p>
<p>to intense workloads like processing depth information on the fly.</p>
<p>A15 Bionic packs a powerful 6-core CPU to handle demanding tasks</p>
<p>smoothly and efficiently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s up to 1.8 times faster than iPhone 8,</p>
<p>and even faster compared to older models.</p>
<p>This CPU is faster than all the competition at any price.</p>
<p>The 4-core GPU is great for graphics intensive use cases</p>
<p>and delivers a monumental improvement for people upgrading.</p>
<p>That means when you buckle up for a race in Apple Arcade&rsquo;s next big release,</p>
<p>Gear.Club Stradale,</p>
<p>the realistic graphics make you feel just like you&rsquo;re on the roads of Tuscany</p>
<p>behind the wheel of your dream car.</p>
<p>Apps can take advantage of the 16-core Neural Engine,</p>
<p>perfect for machine learning tasks</p>
<p>and capable of 15.8 trillion operations per second,</p>
<p>which is 26 times faster than iPhone 8.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re upgrading from a phone without a Neural Engine,</p>
<p>it unlocks new ways to use your iPhone that make your life easier,</p>
<p>like Live Text.</p>
<p>Point your camera at text, and with a tap you can copy it,</p>
<p>translate it, make a call, or send an email.</p>
<p>iPhone SE isn&rsquo;t just powerful. It&rsquo;s beautiful, too.</p>
<p>It features our iconic glass and aluminum design in three fantastic colors,</p>
<p>Midnight, Starlight, and (PRODUCT)Red.</p>
<p>It has a 4.7&quot; Retina HD display with incredible color accuracy.</p>
<p>The display is even more protected by the durable design,</p>
<p>which now includes the toughest glass in a smartphone</p>
<p>on both the front and back.</p>
<p>This is the same glass as the back of iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro.</p>
<p>And with IP67 water and dust resistance,</p>
<p>iPhone SE is designed to last.</p>
<p>iPhone SE has the Home Button with Touch ID</p>
<p>for a secure, private, and easy way to unlock your iPhone,</p>
<p>fill in passcodes, and make purchases with Apple Pay.</p>
<p>iPhone SE has even better battery life</p>
<p>with the efficiency of A15 Bionic, integration with iOS,</p>
<p>our latest battery chemistry, and internal design updates.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re bringing 5G to our most affordable iPhone,</p>
<p>so iPhone SE is can take advantage of the latest generation of technology.</p>
<p>You get super fast downloads and uploads, lower latency,</p>
<p>and better experiences in more places.</p>
<p>Like seeing family with higher-quality HD FaceTime calls,</p>
<p>even when you aren&rsquo;t on Wi-Fi,</p>
<p>or enjoying your favorite movies with friends using SharePlay,</p>
<p>or playing multi-player online games.</p>
<p>iPhone SE also has some of our latest camera innovations.</p>
<p>The 12 megapixel camera and A15 Bionic create a new camera system</p>
<p>that enables powerful computational photography.</p>
<p>Deep Fusion optimizes for texture and detail in every part of the photo.</p>
<p>Smart HDR 4 applies individual adjustments for color,</p>
<p>contrast, and noise to subjects and the background.</p>
<p>Photographic Styles brings your preferred style</p>
<p>automatically to the image pipeline</p>
<p>during capture, while preserving skin tones.</p>
<p>The ISP in A15 Bionic improves video quality</p>
<p>for truer skin tones and reduced noise, especially in lower light.</p>
<p>iPhone SE comes with all the incredible benefits of iOS 15,</p>
<p>including new features like Focus to help reduce distraction to be in the moment</p>
<p>and an all-new Maps experience.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll get intelligent capabilities that protect your privacy</p>
<p>like on-device Siri and on-device dictation</p>
<p>that just weren&rsquo;t possible with older phones.</p>
<p>IPhone SE will get the latest iOS updates for years to come.</p>
<p>iPhone SE continues our commitment to minimize impact on the environment.</p>
<p>Like we did with iPhone 13,</p>
<p>we eliminated the outer plastic wrap from our packaging.</p>
<p>And we use recycled materials in the design of iPhone SE,</p>
<p>like in the Taptic Engine, where we use 100% recycled rare earth elements</p>
<p>and 100% recycled tungsten.</p>
<p>iPhone SE is a fantastic new iPhone</p>
<p>that brings the performance of A15 Bionic, the speed of 5G,</p>
<p>better durability, better battery life,</p>
<p>and advanced new camera capabilities.</p>
<p>And it starts at just $429.</p>
<p>Pre-orders start this Friday.</p>
<p>And iPhone SE will be available on March 18.</p>
<p>Now, back to Tim.</p>
<p>[exciting music]</p>
<p>Tim: The new iPhone SE brings the advanced features</p>
<p>and exceptional performance of A15 to our most affordable iPhone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be great for existing iPhone users</p>
<p>who want a highly capable and compact iPhone and for new users</p>
<p>who want to experience iPhone for the first time.</p>
<p>Apple silicon is a huge part of the success</p>
<p>of another remarkable product, and that&rsquo;s iPad.</p>
<p>The unmatched performance and efficiency of Apple silicon</p>
<p>enables iPad&rsquo;s magical experience,</p>
<p>from its versatility and portability,</p>
<p>to its exceptionally long battery life.</p>
<p>It makes iPad the most powerful device of its kind</p>
<p>and even faster than the vast majority of PC notebooks.</p>
<p>We have a fantastic iPad lineup,</p>
<p>and today I&rsquo;m excited to talk about iPad Air.</p>
<p>We love iPad Air for being incredibly thin, light, and powerful.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re taking its performance to the next level.</p>
<p>[dramatic music]</p>
<p>This is the new, even more amazing iPad Air.</p>
<p>And to tell you all about it, here&rsquo;s Angellina.</p>
<p>[dramatic music]</p>
<p>Angellina: The incredibly popular design of iPad Air</p>
<p>is super-charged with the power of Apple silicon,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s jump right in and talk about performance.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re a college student taking elaborate notes,</p>
<p>a content creator working on your latest project,</p>
<p>or a gamer playing the hottest titles,</p>
<p>great performance is a key reason users choose iPad Air.</p>
<p>So the new Air takes a massive leap in performance,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re bringing the breakthrough M1 Chip to iPad Air.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, this is the same M1 chip that we brought to iPad Pro.</p>
<p>The 8-core design of the CPU delivers up to 60% faster performance</p>
<p>over the A14 in the previous generation of iPad Air.</p>
<p>And M1&rsquo;s 8-core GPU delivers amazing graphics performance,</p>
<p>which is up to twice as fast.</p>
<p>In fact, M1 in the new iPad Air</p>
<p>makes it faster than the fastest competitive tablet.</p>
<p>And the new Air is also up to 2 times faster</p>
<p>than the best selling Windows laptop in its price range,</p>
<p>a device that is 3 times thicker and 4 times heavier than iPad Air.</p>
<p>So for users doing things like</p>
<p>drawing a filter for a social media post with Procreate,</p>
<p>or designing the ultimate kid&rsquo;s bedroom in SketchUP,</p>
<p>the new Air will fly right through it.</p>
<p>And with M1, the new Air becomes a mobile gaming powerhouse.</p>
<p>And machine learning workflows are enhanced</p>
<p>by the incredible 16-core Neural Engine,</p>
<p>enabling powerful and intuitive experiences.</p>
<p>Like using Adobe Lightroom to intelligently select the sky</p>
<p>from the foreground with just a tap so you can edit seamlessly.</p>
<p>And these experiences really come to life</p>
<p>on the Air&rsquo;s gorgeous Liquid Retina display</p>
<p>with its P3 wide color, True Tone,</p>
<p>500 nits of brightness, and anti-reflective coating.</p>
<p>Another big update for iPad Air is the front camera,</p>
<p>because it will now feature a 12 megapixel Ultra Wide camera,</p>
<p>which means it supports Center Stage!</p>
<p>This has been hugely popular for connecting with friends,</p>
<p>colleagues, and loved ones.</p>
<p>And this means that now, all iPad models feature Center Stage.</p>
<p>Next, with its ultra portable design,</p>
<p>we know users need fast wireless connectivity when they&rsquo;re on the go.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re bringing ultra-fast 5G to iPad Air.</p>
<p>Perfect for when you&rsquo;re doing things like using SharePlay</p>
<p>to watch movies with your friends wherever you are.</p>
<p>And to support fast connection to drives, docks, and cameras,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re increasing the performance of the USB-C port.</p>
<p>It is now twice as fast,</p>
<p>so transferring large photos or videos is even quicker.</p>
<p>And iPad Air is compatible with amazing accessories</p>
<p>that make it even more versatile.</p>
<p>Like the Smart Keyboard Folio and Magic Keyboard,</p>
<p>which delivers a fantastic trackpad and typing experience.</p>
<p>iPad Air also supports Apple Pencil 2nd generation,</p>
<p>which users absolutely love for drawing and taking notes.</p>
<p>And of course, driving the entire iPad experience is iPadOS.</p>
<p>iPadOS 15 is packed with powerful new features</p>
<p>like enhanced multi-tasking,</p>
<p>Quick Note, and SharePlay, which make iPad even more capable.</p>
<p>And with the new version of Swift Playgrounds,</p>
<p>users can build and submit apps to the App Store right on iPad.</p>
<p>A new release of iMovie is perfect for aspiring filmmakers</p>
<p>working on their latest masterpiece</p>
<p>or for users who are just getting started.</p>
<p>The new storyboards feature helps users create finished videos</p>
<p>by using curated shot lists, transitions, and music for a polished result.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great new release that will be available next month.</p>
<p>And we continue our commitment to the environment.</p>
<p>The new Air has a number of components with 100% recycled materials,</p>
<p>like the aluminum in the enclosure,</p>
<p>tin in the solder of the main logic board,</p>

<p>With the supercharged performance of M1,</p>
<p>ultrafast 5G, and Center Stage,</p>
<p>we think you&rsquo;re going to love the new iPad Air.</p>
<p>Back to Tim.</p>
<p>[hip-hop music]</p>
<p>Tim: With the addition of M1, iPad Air is now more powerful,</p>
<p>more capable, and simply more fun than ever.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s talk about the Mac.</p>
<p>Apple silicon has transformed the Mac over this past year.</p>
<p>Its incredible performance, custom technologies,</p>
<p>and cutting-edge power efficiency have ushered in a new era for the Mac.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve transitioned nearly every product in the Mac lineup to Apple silicon.</p>
<p>And each of these products has blown away users</p>
<p>and shocked the PC industry.</p>
<p>When we introduced the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air with M1,</p>
<p>our customers no longer had to choose</p>
<p>between incredible performance and amazing battery life.</p>
<p>They could have it all.</p>
<p>And Apple silicon has enabled us to design products</p>
<p>we never could have imagined before,</p>
<p>like the remarkably thin and powerful new iMac</p>
<p>made possible by M1.</p>
<p>And the newest MacBook Pro with M1 Pro and M1 Max has completely redefined</p>
<p>what pros expect from a notebook.</p>
<p>It simply has no equal.</p>
<p>Customers are absolutely loving these systems.</p>
<p>In fact, every quarter since we started shipping M1-based Macs</p>
<p>has been record-breaking</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve outpaced the industry growth during this time.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not stopping there.</p>
<p>To tell you how we&rsquo;re going to take Mac even further, here&rsquo;s John.</p>
<p>[exciting electronic music]</p>
<p>John: Apple silicon has had a profound impact on the Mac.</p>
<p>Every chip in the M1 family has been groundbreaking,</p>
<p>allowing us to make the world&rsquo;s best personal computers for our users.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re going to take the next giant leap.</p>
<p>Because today we&rsquo;re bringing Apple silicon to users</p>
<p>who need even more extreme levels of performance</p>
<p>to unleash their creativity.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re adding one last chip to the M1 family, and it&rsquo;s gonna blow your mind.</p>
<p>Here it is.</p>
<p>[dramatic electronic music]</p>
<p>Introducing M1 Ultra.</p>
<p>It is a monster of a chip.</p>
<p>And it brings breathtaking levels of performance to the Mac desktop.</p>
<p>So let me hand it over to Johny to tell you more</p>
<p>about its incredible architecture.</p>
<p>[exciting electronic music]</p>
<p>Johny: M1 Ultra is the next breakthrough for Apple silicon.</p>
<p>So far, we&rsquo;ve scaled Apple silicon for the Mac from M1 to M1 Pro to M1 Max.</p>
<p>And with each chip, we&rsquo;ve extended the architecture</p>
<p>to deliver phenomenal performance,</p>
<p>while maintaining remarkable power efficiency,</p>
<p>and scaling the unified memory architecture.</p>
<p>This approach has also provided a consistent developer programming model</p>
<p>across the M1 family.</p>
<p>And now we want to take Apple silicon even further</p>
<p>to achieve more extreme levels of performance for the desktop.</p>
<p>The challenge is that there are physical limitations</p>
<p>in creating a larger die than M1 Max.</p>
<p>The leading approach is to use two chips and connect them via the motherboard.</p>
<p>However, that approach has significant tradeoffs,</p>
<p>including increased latency,</p>
<p>reduced bandwidth and much higher power consumption.</p>
<p>This also burdens developers with the need to change their code</p>
<p>for this architecture.</p>
<p>So with M1 Ultra, we did something truly groundbreaking.</p>
<p>And it actually starts with M1 Max, the most powerful SoC we’ve built to date.</p>
<p>With its high-performance CPU, massive GPU,</p>
<p>and tremendous unified memory bandwidth, M1 Max is incredibly capable,</p>
<p>and its amazing performance is delivered</p>
<p>while maintaining industry-leading power efficiency.</p>
<p>Yet it&rsquo;s even more capable than what we’ve shared.</p>
<p>You see, M1 Max has a secret.</p>
<p>A hidden feature we haven’t talked about until now.</p>
<p>It has a groundbreaking die to die interconnect technology</p>
<p>that allows us to scale even further by building M1 Ultra from two M1 Max die,</p>
<p>which doubles performance.</p>
<p>And we connect the two die</p>
<p>with our innovative, custom-built packaging architecture.</p>
<p>This multi-die architecture is way ahead of anything else in the industry,</p>
<p>and we call it UltraFusion.</p>
<p>The UltraFusion architecture uses a silicon interposer</p>
<p>that has twice the connection density of any technology available.</p>
<p>It connects over 10,000 signals</p>
<p>and provides an enormous 2.5TB/s</p>
<p>of low latency, inter-processor bandwidth</p>
<p>between the two die using very little power.</p>
<p>That’s more than 4 times the bandwidth</p>
<p>of the leading multi-chip interconnect technology.</p>
<p>The result is an SoC with blazing performance</p>
<p>due to low latency, massive bandwidth, and incredible power efficiency.</p>
<p>And thanks to the magic of the UltraFusion architecture,</p>
<p>it behaves like a single chip to software</p>
<p>and preserves the benefits of the unified memory.</p>
<p>M1 Ultra has 114 billion transistors.</p>
<p>That’s 7 times more than M1.</p>
<p>It’s the most ever in a personal computer chip.</p>
<p>And when you add it to the M1 family,</p>
<p>you can see the huge difference in area between M1 and M1 Ultra.</p>
<p>This multi-die architecture also supports a higher bandwidth memory subsystem.</p>
<p>In fact, with two die, the memory bandwidth</p>
<p>is increased to a massive 800GB/s.</p>
<p>That’s more than 10 times the latest PC desktop chip.</p>
<p>And doubling the memory channels also means M1 Ultra supports</p>
<p>up to a staggering 128GB of unified memory</p>
<p>for enormous workloads.</p>
<p>M1 Ultra also offers an unbelievable amount of compute performance.</p>
<p>It has a powerful 20-core CPU</p>
<p>with 16 high-performance cores</p>
<p>and 4 high-efficiency cores</p>
<p>to crush CPU intensive tasks.</p>
<p>It also features a huge 64-core GPU,</p>
<p>so it can speed through the most intense graphic tasks.</p>
<p>It’s nearly 8 times M1.</p>
<p>M1 Ultra has 32 powerful Neural Engine cores</p>
<p>that can run up to 22 trillion operations per second</p>
<p>to accelerate the most formidable machine learning tasks.</p>
<p>And it has twice the capabilities of the amazing Media Engine in M1 Max</p>
<p>for unprecedented ProRes video encode and decode throughput.</p>
<p>Power efficiency affects the entire system,</p>
<p>including enclosure design, thermals, acoustics, and, ultimately, performance.</p>
<p>So the industry leading performance per watt of M1 Max and M1 Ultra</p>
<p>is a huge advantage for a desktop.</p>
<p>M1 Max delivers similar multithreaded CPU performance</p>
<p>to the latest 10-core PC desktop chip</p>
<p>while using 65% less power.</p>
<p>And when we compare M1 Ultra</p>
<p>to the fastest 16-core PC desktop chip available,</p>
<p>it delivers 90% higher performance in the same power envelope.</p>
<p>And M1 Ultra can deliver the PC chip’s peak performance</p>
<p>while using an astounding 100W less power.</p>
<p>When we look at GPU performance and power,</p>
<p>M1 Max delivers similar performance to one of the most popular GPUs</p>
<p>while using 1/3 the power.</p>
<p>And M1 Ultra delivers faster performance than the highest-end GPU available</p>
<p>while using 200W less power.</p>
<p>M1 Ultra provides industry-leading desktop class performance</p>
<p>and power efficiency,</p>
<p>allowing us to deliver incredible performance</p>
<p>in a much smaller, more efficient design.</p>
<p>So that’s the groundbreaking M1 Ultra.</p>
<p>It’s the most powerful and capable chip ever for a personal computer.</p>
<p>Now, back to John.</p>
<p>John: M1 Ultra takes Apple silicon further than ever.</p>
<p>It’s another game-changing chip for our pro users.</p>
<p>Now, one of the things that makes Apple silicon so unique</p>
<p>is how tightly it integrates with the operating system.</p>
<p>This integration enables macOS to scale with M1 Ultra,</p>
<p>allowing it to automatically benefit from M1 Ultra’s immense capabilities,</p>
<p>delivering another big step forward in performance.</p>
<p>It also enables us to deliver an amazing experience for our users.</p>
<p>Everything is super fast and incredibly responsive,</p>
<p>and the system and user data are protected with industry-leading security.</p>
<p>The transition to Apple silicon</p>
<p>has delivered the largest collection of apps ever for Mac,</p>
<p>including iPhone and iPad apps, which can now run on Mac,</p>
<p>and universal apps</p>
<p>that unlock the full power of the M1 family.</p>
<p>And new apps with unbelievable performance continue to be released every week.</p>
<p>We’re thrilled with how well this transition is going.</p>
<p>And because M1 Ultra looks like a single piece of silicon to software,</p>
<p>apps will benefit from its extraordinary capabilities</p>
<p>without any additional work.</p>
<p>Let’s hear what some of our developers have to say about it.</p>
<p>Anna: What? 128 gigs of RAM?</p>
<p>Joy: There is no delay. It’s just a toggle. Like a light switch.</p>
<p>Ruby: You don’t actually have that time to stir your coffee</p>
<p>because the file just opens.</p>
<p>And you’re like &ldquo;Oh, okay. Let’s get to work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anna: Hi, I’m Anna, and I work at Ableton as a software developer.</p>
<p>Victoria: Principal product manager at Adobe for motion graphics.</p>
<p>Ruby: I’m Ruby at Vectorworks.</p>
<p>Elly: I’m Elly Wade, and I work at Maxon.</p>
<p>Larissa: Larissa Supnik. I’m the lead Sapphire developer.</p>
<p>Joy: 3D designer, and I specialize in fabric simulation.</p>
<p>Victoria: What we’re really seeing with the M1 Ultra is a faster workflow</p>
<p>from very first launch all the way through the final export.</p>
<p>The UI is more fluid.</p>
<p>Previewing is faster.</p>
<p>If you can speed up every one of those loops,</p>
<p>you keep people in their creative flow.</p>
<p>Larissa: Getting that kind of performance change</p>
<p>between generations is pretty amazing.</p>
<p>Joy: Now a designer can say,</p>
<p>“I want this change and I want to do this,” and do that instantly.</p>
<p>Elly: Scene rendering is up to 4 times faster.</p>
<p>And now with these new performance speeds, I can take it to the next level.</p>
<p>You’re only limited by your own imagination.</p>
<p>Whether it is photo realistic renders</p>
<p>or whether it is millions of objects flying everywhere.</p>
<p>Ruby: Everything just flows.</p>
<p>One of the things that you’ll really notice</p>
<p>is the navigation in the 3D environment.</p>
<p>It’s all very responsive and it creates this uninterrupted experience.</p>
<p>Larissa: With the 270S Sapphire effect,</p>
<p>being able to get effects that users love using</p>
<p>so much of the time faster is phenomenal.</p>
<p>Anna: You could just keep putting layers on top of layers and more layers.</p>
<p>Joy: The fabric simulation is faster now.</p>
<p>So I’m able to see little subtle details.</p>
<p>Little things like puckering, gathering, pulling of the fabric,</p>
<p>when I wasn’t able to see that before.</p>
<p>Victoria: Does it feel buttery smooth? There’s an emotional component to it.</p>
<p>Anna: M1 Ultra seems very unimpressed with the load I ask it to handle.</p>
<p>Now, you could add more wave table synthesizers together</p>
<p>and that contributes to the richness of your sound.</p>
<p>There’s more room for improvisation. DJ sets become more expressive.</p>
<p>Ruby: People are going to be able</p>
<p>to really push the bounds of their creativity.</p>
<p>Victoria: You can actually trust that your stuff’s going to get done on a deadline.</p>
<p>Joy: Now we’re going to have designers from different backgrounds,</p>
<p>different voices, different experiences,</p>
<p>being able to have a seat at the table.</p>
<p>Anna: The answer to “what’s going to happen” is,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don’t know,&rdquo; and that’s exciting.</p>
<p>[dramatic music]</p>
<p>John: The combination of M1 Ultra and macOS</p>
<p>cranks up the performance of Mac yet again.</p>
<p>So now let’s talk about</p>
<p>where we’re going to use this incredible new chip.</p>
<p>Today, we’re going to focus on the place</p>
<p>where so many people create their life’s best work, the studio.</p>
<p>A studio is where creators like designers, scientists, and developers</p>
<p>change the world.</p>
<p>Whether it’s in a home or an office,</p>
<p>each studio is unique,</p>
<p>customized with the tools that complete the user’s workflow,</p>
<p>and for many, the Mac plays a pivotal role in this space.</p>
<p>With the transition to M1, we’ve provided these users</p>
<p>with two great desktops, iMac and Mac mini,</p>
<p>which have remarkable performance and entirely new capabilities.</p>
<p>Yet there are some users who want even more</p>
<p>so they can push the limits of their creativity.</p>

<p>This is Mac Studio and Studio Display.</p>
<p>Mac Studio is an entirely new Mac</p>
<p>with the unbelievable performance of our most powerful Apple silicon,</p>
<p>M1 Max and M1 Ultra.</p>
<p>And the Studio Display is the perfect complement to Mac Studio,</p>
<p>with a phenomenal set of features</p>
<p>and that integrated experience Mac users love.</p>
<p>So let’s dive in, starting with Mac Studio.</p>
<p>And to tell you all about it, here’s Colleen.</p>
<p>Colleen: Mac Studio is a breakthrough in personal computing.</p>
<p>It’s unlike anything you’ve ever seen before.</p>
<p>It’s the first computer to put outrageous performance,</p>
<p>extensive connectivity, and entirely new capabilities</p>
<p>into an unbelievably compact form that lives right on your desk,</p>
<p>where it’s always within easy reach.</p>
<p>Mac Studio is going to completely transform studio workflows everywhere.</p>
<p>Let’s start with its design.</p>
<p>With the power and efficiency of Apple silicon,</p>
<p>we were able to totally reimagine</p>
<p>what a high-performance desktop could look like.</p>
<p>The exterior is machined from a single aluminum extrusion,</p>
<p>with a footprint of just 7.7 inches square</p>
<p>and height of only 3.7-inches,</p>
<p>so it takes up very little space and fits perfectly under most displays.</p>
<p>Inside, every element was designed to produce</p>
<p>an unprecedented amount of performance in such a small form factor.</p>
<p>The innovative thermal system begins with a unique double-sided blower</p>
<p>pulling air into the system, across the entire circumference</p>
<p>of the perforated aluminum base.</p>
<p>The air moves over the custom circular power supply and through channels</p>
<p>precisely placed to guide it to the chip’s thermal module.</p>
<p>Finally, the air is propelled through a low-impedance rear exhaust</p>
<p>containing over 2,000 precisely-machined perforations.</p>
<p>And due to the efficiency of M1 Max and M1 Ultra, the sound is so minimal.</p>
<p>For most workloads, you’ll barely even hear it.</p>
<p>With this remarkably compact and quiet system within arm&rsquo;s reach,</p>
<p>you get easy access to essential connectivity throughout the day.</p>
<p>So next, let&rsquo;s take a look at the high-performance I/O Mac Studio provides.</p>
<p>On the back, there are four Thunderbolt 4 ports</p>
<p>to connect displays and high-performance devices,</p>
<p>a 10 Gigabit Ethernet port, two USB-A ports, an HDMI port,</p>
<p>and a pro audio jack for high-impedance headphones</p>
<p>or external amplified speakers.</p>
<p>WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5 are built in as well.</p>
<p>And since many users frequently connect and disconnect devices,</p>
<p>like portable storage,</p>
<p>we also put connectivity on the front, for even easier access.</p>
<p>Systems with M1 Max have two USB-C ports,</p>
<p>providing 10 gigabits per second USB-3 data transfer.</p>
<p>And with M1 Ultra, these ports are Thunderbolt 4,</p>
<p>with up to 40 gigabits per second data transfer speeds.</p>
<p>There’s also an SD card slot to easily import photos or video.</p>
<p>And Mac Studio offers extensive display support,</p>
<p>for up to four Pro Display XDRs, plus a 4K TV,</p>
<p>driving nearly 90 million pixels.</p>
<p>With this wide array of advanced connectivity,</p>
<p>you can configure your studio to your exact needs.</p>
<p>Now let’s take a look</p>
<p>at the unprecedented performance Mac Studio will deliver.</p>
<p>When you compare Mac Studio to our most powerful Mac desktops,</p>
<p>the 27-inch iMac and Mac Pro,</p>
<p>it takes performance to astonishing new heights.</p>
<p>Let’s start with Mac Studio with M1 Max.</p>
<p>For CPU performance, Mac Studio with M1 Max is up to 2.5 times faster</p>
<p>than the fastest 27-inch iMac,</p>
<p>and its 50% faster than Mac Pro with a 16-core Xeon processor,</p>
<p>our most popular configuration.</p>
<p>Graphics performance on Mac Studio with M1 Max is also tremendous.</p>
<p>It’s up to 3.4x faster</p>
<p>than the fastest graphics on the 27-inch iMac.</p>
<p>And it even outperforms Mac Pro with its most popular graphics card.</p>
<p>Mac Studio is over 3x faster.</p>
<p>Mac Studio with M1 Max is the high-performance machine</p>
<p>many of our users have been waiting for to take their workflows to the next level.</p>
<p>And Mac Studio with M1 Ultra</p>
<p>takes performance to a whole other dimension.</p>
<p>The CPU performance on Mac Studio with M1 Ultra is up to 3.8x faster</p>
<p>than the fastest 27-inch iMac.</p>
<p>And it’s up to 90% faster than Mac Pro with 16-cores.</p>
<p>We can even compare Mac Studio with M1 Ultra</p>
<p>to Mac Pro with 28-cores.</p>
<p>It’s up to 60% faster.</p>
<p>That is incredible.</p>
<p>And graphics performance on Mac Studio with M1 Ultra just crushes 27-inch iMac.</p>
<p>It’s up to a remarkable 4.5x faster.</p>
<p>It even exceeds Mac Pro with its fastest graphics card.</p>
<p>Mac Studio is up to 80% faster.</p>
<p>Now, in the same way that MacBook Pro</p>
<p>shattered the limits of graphics memory in a laptop,</p>
<p>Mac Studio will do the same for the desktop.</p>
<p>The most powerful workstation graphics card available today</p>
<p>offers 48GB of video memory.</p>
<p>With M1 Max, you can access up to 64GB of unified memory.</p>
<p>And with M1 Ultra, you get up to 128GB of unified memory</p>
<p>for enormous graphics tasks.</p>
<p>No other graphics card comes close.</p>
<p>And when it comes to storage,</p>
<p>the SSD in Mac Studio delivers up to a super fast 7.4GB per second</p>
<p>of performance and up to 8TB capacity.</p>
<p>Today, more and more cameras are capturing ProRes video,</p>
<p>from the iPhone 13 Pro to the Sony Venice cinema camera.</p>
<p>With M1 Ultra’s extraordinarily powerful Media Engine,</p>
<p>Mac Studio can play an unprecedented 18 streams</p>
<p>of 8K ProRes 422 video.</p>
<p>There is no other computer in the world that can do this.</p>
<p>To sum up this game-changing performance,</p>
<p>Mac Studio with M1 Max is up to 3.4x faster than our fastest iMac.</p>
<p>It’s a huge upgrade for 27-inch iMac users</p>
<p>looking to move to more powerful Apple silicon.</p>
<p>And for those looking for the most extreme performance,</p>
<p>Mac Studio with M1 Ultra is up to 80% faster</p>
<p>than our top of the line Mac Pro.</p>
<p>So now let’s take a look at how this unprecedented performance</p>
<p>is going to transform the studio.</p>
<p>With the breakthrough capabilities of Mac Studio,</p>
<p>users can completely reimagine their workflows</p>
<p>and push their creativity further than ever.</p>
<p>For musicians, Mac Studio powers the digital audio workstation</p>
<p>they’ve been dreaming of.</p>
<p>They can bring their most complex compositions to life</p>
<p>with hundreds of tracks, plug-ins, and virtual instruments</p>
<p>all played in real-time.</p>
<p>3D studios have new, breakthrough capabilities with Mac Studio.</p>
<p>Artists can now interact fluidly with more extreme geometry</p>
<p>and run complex particle simulations in a fraction of the time.</p>
<p>They can even work with massive environments</p>
<p>that were previously impossible to render.</p>
<p>For software development studios, Mac Studio is an absolute monster.</p>
<p>Engineers can now build new versions of their code in warp speed</p>
<p>and run more automated integration and testing than ever.</p>
<p>Mac Studio brings staggering performance to the photo studio.</p>
<p>Photographers can capture and edit huge gigapixel images</p>
<p>composited with hundreds of layers,</p>
<p>and export final images for publish in a flash.</p>
<p>And Mac Studio is a powerhouse system for video studios.</p>
<p>Colorists can add more corrections to their project</p>
<p>while maintaining fluid playback.</p>
<p>Editors working on multi-cam projects</p>
<p>can play more streams of 8K video than ever before.</p>
<p>And encoding video for final delivery is faster than ever.</p>
<p>The performance and capability that Mac Studio brings</p>
<p>to so many studios is going to change everything.</p>
<p>There’s never been a desktop like it.</p>
<p>And when it comes to the environment, Mac Studio raises the bar yet again.</p>
<p>It uses far less energy than competitors to deliver its extraordinary performance.</p>
<p>Over the course of a year, Mac Studio will use</p>
<p>up to 1,000 kilowatt-hours less energy than a high-end PC desktop.</p>
<p>Mac Studio is also free of numerous harmful substances.</p>
<p>It uses 100% recycled rare earth elements in the magnets</p>
<p>and recycled tin in the solder of the main logic board.</p>
<p>So that’s Mac Studio,</p>
<p>featuring M1 Max and the new M1 Ultra,</p>
<p>the most powerful chip ever built for a personal computer.</p>
<p>Mac Studio will supercharge the workspace with breathtaking performance,</p>
<p>unleashing your creativity like never before.</p>
<p>Now, we designed Mac Studio together with the Studio Display,</p>
<p>to complete the ultimate studio experience.</p>
<p>And to tell you more, here’s Nicole.</p>
<p>[exciting music]</p>
<p>Nicole: The Studio Display is in a class of its own.</p>
<p>Along with a gorgeous screen, it’s loaded with incredible features</p>
<p>that no other desktop display can deliver.</p>
<p>And it provides that integrated experience Mac users love.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the design.</p>
<p>Studio Display has an all-screen design with narrow borders.</p>
<p>Its all-aluminum enclosure</p>
<p>houses an advanced set of features in a slim profile,</p>
<p>and the stand allows you to tilt the display up to 30 degrees.</p>
<p>To customize Studio Display for your workspace,</p>
<p>you can also choose a tilt- and height-adjustable stand option,</p>
<p>which has a counterbalancing arm</p>
<p>that makes the display feel weightless.</p>
<p>There’s also a VESA adapter option</p>
<p>that lets you mount the display in landscape or portrait orientation.</p>
<p>Studio Display features an expansive screen</p>
<p>that has a 27-inch active area</p>
<p>with a total of 14.7 million pixels at 218 pixels per inch,</p>
<p>making it a 5K Retina display.</p>
<p>And with 600 nits of brightness, P3 wide color,</p>
<p>and support for over a billion colors,</p>
<p>it brings images to life with spectacular detail.</p>
<p>It also has True Tone for a more natural viewing experience,</p>
<p>plus an industry-leading anti-reflective coating,</p>
<p>for better comfort and readability.</p>
<p>And for studios with bright light sources,</p>
<p>there’s an innovative nano-texture glass option</p>
<p>that scatters light to further minimize glare,</p>
<p>while delivering outstanding image quality.</p>
<p>Another thing that makes Studio Display unique</p>
<p>is the fact that it actually has an A13 Bionic chip inside,</p>
<p>which enables it to deliver amazing experiences</p>
<p>with a highly advanced camera and audio system.</p>
<p>There’s a 12-megapixel Ultra Wide camera,</p>
<p>which is the same sensational camera that&rsquo;s been a huge hit on iPad.</p>
<p>And powered by the incredible technology in Apple silicon,</p>
<p>it supports Center Stage,</p>
<p>which comes to the Mac for the very first time,</p>
<p>so video calls are so much more engaging.</p>
<p>And to make this the ultimate video conferencing display,</p>
<p>it also includes an array of studio-quality mics.</p>
<p>They have an especially low noise floor for crystal-clear calls.</p>
<p>Studio Display also features a high-fidelity six-speaker sound system</p>
<p>that delivers an unbelievable listening experience.</p>
<p>It has four force-cancelling woofers that minimize distortion</p>
<p>and produce bold, articulate bass</p>
<p>and two high-performance tweeters that create accurate mids and crisp highs.</p>
<p>And because Apple silicon can process multi-channel surround sound,</p>
<p>the speakers also support Spatial Audio</p>
<p>for music and video with Dolby Atmos,</p>
<p>creating a truly cinematic viewing experience.</p>
<p>Simply put, these are, by far, the highest fidelity speakers</p>
<p>we’ve ever created for the Mac.</p>
<p>And this is the best combination of camera and audio</p>
<p>ever in a desktop display.</p>
<p>Next, let’s talk about how Studio Display connects with your other devices.</p>
<p>It has three USB-C ports that deliver speeds up to 10 gigabits per second.</p>
<p>So you can connect peripherals, storage, and networking right into the display.</p>
<p>And there’s a Thunderbolt port, which allows you to connect Studio Display</p>
<p>and any plugged in peripherals to your Mac with a single cable.</p>
<p>That same cable delivers 96W of power,</p>
<p>which allows you to charge any Mac notebook,</p>
<p>and it can even fast charge a 14-inch MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>And you can connect up to three Studio Displays to your MacBook Pro,</p>
<p>creating an incredible edit bay or 3D animation studio.</p>
<p>Finally, to complete your setup,</p>
<p>we’ve added a new silver and black color option</p>
<p>to the Magic Keyboard with Touch ID,</p>
<p>the Magic Trackpad,</p>
<p>and the Magic Mouse,</p>
<p>which beautifully complement the design of the display.</p>
<p>Studio Display has also been designed to minimize its environmental impact.</p>
<p>It uses 100% recycled rare earth elements in all magnets</p>
<p>and is free of numerous harmful substances.</p>
<p>It also meets our high standards for energy efficiency.</p>
<p>So that’s the all-new Studio Display.</p>
<p>No other display has this unique offering of 5K Retina resolution</p>
<p>and advanced camera with Center Stage</p>
<p>and incredibly high fidelity audio,</p>
<p>all in a refined, aluminum design.</p>
<p>And it’s a great display to pair with any Mac,</p>
<p>like MacBook Pro, MacBook Air,</p>
