    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Jocko Willink.</p>
<p>Jocko Willink is a retired Navy SEAL,</p>
<p>an author of numerous important books</p>
<p>on leadership and team dynamics,</p>
<p>and the host of the Jocko Podcast.</p>
<p>During his 20-year career with the US Navy,</p>
<p>Jocko served with SEAL Team 3</p>
<p>as commander of Task Unit Bruiser in Ramadi, Iraq,</p>
<p>and elsewhere in the Middle East,</p>
<p>as well as deployments in Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>After retiring from the Navy,</p>
<p>Jocko used his experience and knowledge</p>
<p>gleaned from his time in the SEAL teams</p>
<p>as a way to develop tools that anybody can use</p>
<p>to develop their leadership skills,</p>
<p>both for leading themselves and for leading others.</p>
<p>That took the form of several important books,</p>
<p>the first of which was published in 2015</p>
<p>and is entitled,</p>
<p>Extreme Ownership, How US Navy SEALs Lead and Win.</p>
<p>He has also authored several books for kids</p>
<p>about leadership, personal development,</p>
<p>and how to navigate various aspects of life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read both Extreme Ownership</p>
<p>and The Way of the Warrior Kid,</p>
<p>and I found them to be immensely useful</p>
<p>in terms of actionable information</p>
<p>and understanding of oneself</p>
<p>and different kinds of relationships,</p>
<p>both in and out of the workplace.</p>
<p>Typically guests on the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>are scientists and or clinicians.</p>
<p>It was some time ago that I was a guest</p>
<p>on the Jocko Podcast,</p>
<p>and during the course of our conversation on his podcast,</p>
<p>we quickly realized that many of the science-based tools</p>
<p>that my laboratory has focused on</p>
<p>and that I&rsquo;ve used over the years</p>
<p>and shared on the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>had direct overlap and parallel with many of the tools</p>
<p>that Jocko and other members of the SEAL teams</p>
<p>had arrived at independently,</p>
<p>that is without knowledge of the underlying science.</p>
<p>And in fact, he had many more tools</p>
<p>that he had incorporated during his years in the SEAL teams,</p>
<p>as well as in business leadership,</p>
<p>in family and elsewhere in life,</p>
<p>that I quickly realized</p>
<p>it would be an enormously valuable conversation</p>
<p>to have him on this podcast</p>
<p>in order to share those tools with the general public.</p>
<p>During today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>we discussed numerous tools that Jocko has taught</p>
<p>and used over the years in a number of different contexts,</p>
<p>including tools for generating more physical energy</p>
<p>and for generating more focus and cognitive energy,</p>
<p>and for navigating sticking points,</p>
<p>that is how to deal with lack of motivation,</p>
<p>how to deal with difficult relationships</p>
<p>in the workplace and elsewhere,</p>
<p>and perhaps most importantly,</p>
<p>how to think about and navigate the self.</p>
<p>In fact, we spend quite a bit of time</p>
<p>talking about this notion of the self and one&rsquo;s self-identity</p>
<p>and how self-identity plays into our ability</p>
<p>to engage in actions of specific types</p>
<p>consistently over time, where it can hold us back,</p>
<p>how to gain better perspective,</p>
<p>and how to help others gain better perspective</p>
<p>so that we can work better with them and them with us.</p>
<p>We also go deep into the likely scientific mechanisms</p>
<p>underlying why the tools that Jocko teaches and uses</p>
<p>are so effective.</p>
<p>In fact, one thing that you&rsquo;ll immediately notice</p>
<p>is that Jocko was writing things down</p>
<p>and I was writing things down throughout the conversation.</p>
<p>And that just reflects the fact</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s not just an immensely powerful teacher,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s also a practitioner and an avid learner.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s always seeking knowledge.</p>
<p>So we kick back and forth our ideas about what likely does</p>
<p>and does not underlie different tools and techniques,</p>
<p>focusing of course,</p>
<p>mostly on what works in the practical sense in the world.</p>
<p>What I can assure you is that by the end of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>thanks to Jocko&rsquo;s immense generosity and curiosity,</p>
<p>you will come away with a large number of tools</p>
<p>and much richer understanding of how to navigate</p>
<p>and enhance mental health, physical health,</p>
<p>and performance in all aspects of life.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Maui Nui.</p>
<p>Maui Nui is venison that is by far the most nutrient dense</p>
<p>and delicious red meat commercially available.</p>
<p>Maui Nui spent nearly a decade</p>
<p>building a USDA certified wild harvesting system</p>
<p>to help balance invasive deer populations</p>
<p>on the Island of Maui.</p>
<p>The solution they built turns the proliferation</p>
<p>of an otherwise invasive species</p>
<p>into a wide range of nutrient dense products,</p>
<p>from fresh butcher cuts and organ meats,</p>
<p>to bone broth, jerky, and even pet treats.</p>
<p>The quality and nutrient value Maui Nui meets</p>
<p>is extraordinary.</p>
<p>For instance, their bone broth has an unmatched</p>
<p>25 grams of protein per a hundred calories.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve talked about with guests</p>
<p>and in solo episodes of this podcast,</p>
<p>getting adequate protein intake,</p>
<p>and in particular high quality protein intake,</p>
<p>is extremely important.</p>
<p>Current research suggests that most people</p>
<p>should be getting about one gram per pound of body weight</p>
<p>of quality protein per day.</p>
<p>And Maui Nui meats are of the absolute highest quality</p>
<p>in terms of the amino acid profile</p>
<p>and other nutrients contained in their venison.</p>
<p>If you would like to try Maui Nui venison,</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.</p>
<p>Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers</p>
<p>with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve discussed many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key importance of temperature</p>
<p>in regulating the quality of your sleep.</p>
<p>Put simply, in order to fall asleep</p>
<p>and stay deeply asleep throughout the night,</p>
<p>your body temperature has to drop</p>
<p>by about one to three degrees.</p>
<p>And waking up, conversely,</p>
<p>involves your body temperature increasing</p>
<p>by about one to three degrees.</p>
<p>Now, people vary in their core body temperature</p>
<p>and whether or not they tend to run hot or cold</p>
<p>throughout the night,</p>
<p>but with Eight Sleep mattresses and mattress covers,</p>
<p>you can literally program in the exact temperature</p>
<p>that you want to sleep in.</p>
<p>And that allows you to fall deeply asleep,</p>
<p>go into slow-wave sleep and REM sleep,</p>
<p>that is rapid eye movement sleep,</p>
<p>in the exact sequence that you need to</p>
<p>in order to have the best quality sleep,</p>
<p>and it will even track your sleep for you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been sleeping with an Eight Sleep mattress cover</p>
<p>on my mattress for about eight months now,</p>
<p>and it is incredible.</p>
<p>My sleep was already pretty good,</p>
<p>and now it is fantastic,</p>
<p>and I feel so much more alert and focused.</p>
<p>My mood is far better throughout the day.</p>
<p>I thought I was optimized,</p>
<p>and with Eight Sleep, now I realize I had a lot more room</p>
<p>to improve my sleep and my daytime wakefulness.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Eight Sleep,</p>
<p>you can go to eightsleep.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and check out their Pod Pro cover</p>
<p>and save $150 at checkout.</p>
<p>Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,</p>
<p>and selected countries in the EU and Australia.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s eightsleep.com slash Huberman</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength,</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>And right now, Element has two special flavors</p>
<p>for the holidays, chocolate caramel and mint chocolate.</p>
<p>By the way, both of those taste extremely good cold</p>
<p>and even better, I find, heated up.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, you can have them as kind of a tea,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re delicious,</p>
<p>and all of their flavors are delicious.</p>
<p>For the ones that you drink typically cold,</p>
<p>I like the raspberry flavor, the watermelon flavor,</p>
<p>and frankly, I like the citrus flavor as well.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to element, lmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentous Supplements.</p>
<p>To find the supplements we discuss</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,</p>
<p>livemomentous.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And I should just mention that the library</p>
<p>of those supplements is constantly expanding.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentous.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now for my discussion with Jocko Willink.</p>
<p>Jocko Willink, welcome.</p>
<p>Thanks for having me, man.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m super excited and super happy to have you here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad to be here.</p>
<p>I know that you and I did five and a half hours</p>
<p>on my podcast, so schedule is clear.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>And actually, and people will see the Jocko Go drinks.</p>
<p>This is not some sort of promotional by me,</p>
<p>but these are the energy drinks I drink.</p>
<p>So this could be called the Bring Your Own Go podcast.</p>
<p>It is the energy drink I drink.</p>
<p>And no, I&rsquo;m not told to promote that</p>
<p>or paid to promote that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the one that I drink.</p>
<p>So there you go.</p>
<p>No pun intended.</p>
<p>I was just saying to our producer a moment ago</p>
<p>that rarely do I sit down and do a podcast</p>
<p>with somebody that&rsquo;s skilled in podcasting.</p>
<p>Lex Friedman would be the only person</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve had on this podcast, I believe,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s also a podcaster.</p>
<p>Since you&rsquo;re a podcaster and many other things,</p>
<p>I confess I&rsquo;m a little bit intimidated.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a weird thing to actually call a skill</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s something that I just kind of started doing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that you just kind of started doing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that Lex just kind of started doing.</p>
<p>And I never practiced it.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t sit down before my first podcast</p>
<p>and think about how I should deliver things.</p>
<p>I just kind of did it.</p>
<p>So maybe it&rsquo;s just luck more than skill.</p>
<p>Well, you and I actually go back further</p>
<p>than that conversation that we had on your podcast.</p>
<p>I think it might&rsquo;ve been 2014, 2015,</p>
<p>and you were on the Tim Ferriss podcast.</p>
<p>And the time I was living with my girlfriend,</p>
<p>we had moved from San Diego to the Bay Area.</p>
<p>We were living in this little tiny apartment</p>
<p>in a basement in Oakland,</p>
<p>trying to save up to buy a place</p>
<p>or rent a place that was decent to live in.</p>
<p>And we both knew a lot of team guys.</p>
<p>She knew more team guys than I did in San Diego.</p>
<p>I dated a few, just to be direct.</p>
<p>Great woman.</p>
<p>Those guys were cool to me, mostly.</p>
<p>And I remember when I saw the photo</p>
<p>on the top card for Tim&rsquo;s podcast, it was your face.</p>
<p>I said, do you know this guy from San Diego?</p>
<p>And she goes, nope.</p>
<p>But if you had to draw a Navy SEAL, that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;d draw.</p>
<p>So I think for a lot of people,</p>
<p>you embody their notion of a number of different things.</p>
<p>Some of which you talk about,</p>
<p>but some of which when you open up a bit</p>
<p>and really get specific about work in the military</p>
<p>and work in daily life and what it is to be you,</p>
<p>but really what it is to be a human being,</p>
<p>some important contradictions also emerge, right?</p>
<p>Obviously, discipline is a theme</p>
<p>that people associate with you, right?</p>
<p>In my view, and I think in the view of a lot of people,</p>
<p>you embody discipline.</p>
<p>So today I definitely want to talk about routines,</p>
<p>but also mindsets, but also things that you do</p>
<p>and ways that you approach things</p>
<p>that might not contradict, but not be so obvious to people,</p>
<p>might be a little bit counterintuitive.</p>
<p>And in addition to that,</p>
<p>you have a lot of different aspects to your life.</p>
<p>In addition to running businesses, you&rsquo;re a family man,</p>
<p>you have children and married a long time.</p>
<p>And so you have a lot of knowledge</p>
<p>from different domains of life.</p>
<p>So with your permission,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to dive into all of them over the next 26 hours.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s dive.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated by this idea of sense of self.</p>
<p>I feel like all of us can look back</p>
<p>to a time early in life when we first had some experience,</p>
<p>could be in art class, could be fishing, could be sport,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really matter what the exact experience was,</p>
<p>but where we first realized</p>
<p>that there are really cool things in the world,</p>
<p>like something that turned us on at the level of excitement</p>
<p>or maybe scared us or something like that.</p>
<p>Do you have any recollection of such an event?</p>
<p>Maybe not the first one,</p>
<p>but do you ever remember hearing</p>
<p>or seeing something as a young kid</p>
<p>and maybe you could tell us how young</p>
<p>and just thinking like, yeah, more of that, please.</p>
<p>A lot of times when people ask questions</p>
<p>along this line of like, when was there a moment, right?</p>
<p>When was there a moment that you realized discipline</p>
<p>or when was there a moment you realized leadership</p>
<p>or when was there a moment you realized detachment?</p>
<p>Kind of like the question here,</p>
<p>when was there a moment you realized,</p>
<p>for lack of a better way of saying it, I&rsquo;m a person, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a person with my own thoughts</p>
<p>and I can make things happen.</p>
<p>And for me, all those answers are usually fairly gradual.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a little thing that indicates</p>
<p>and you get a clue</p>
<p>and then you move a little bit further down that road,</p>
<p>then you get another clue</p>
<p>and you move a little bit further down that road</p>
<p>and you get another clue.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I would say for me,</p>
<p>life was like when I was a little kid,</p>
<p>I was kind of slowly discovering that I was a person,</p>
<p>I was a human.</p>
<p>I remember my mom took me shopping.</p>
<p>I was probably about 10 years old</p>
<p>and I needed to get pants for school.</p>
<p>And my mom took me shopping.</p>
<p>And when I went into the store,</p>
<p>there was a girl that was,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re called in a store,</p>
<p>a retail sales girl.</p>
<p>She was probably about 16.</p>
<p>And I started chatting her up, right?</p>
<p>And I kind of recognized it a little bit,</p>
<p>but I sort of didn&rsquo;t too.</p>
<p>And I just was chatting to this girl</p>
<p>and I was making her laugh.</p>
<p>I was having a good time with the whole thing</p>
<p>and putting on the pants and spinning around</p>
<p>and she was laughing.</p>
<p>And I remember when we left the store with the pants</p>
<p>and my mom was sort of talking to me</p>
<p>about the fact that,</p>
<p>well, what were you trying to do to that girl?</p>
<p>And I was thinking to myself,</p>
<p>well, I kind of liked that girl.</p>
<p>She was pretty.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know why that popped into my head,</p>
<p>but I just remember thinking,</p>
<p>hey man, there&rsquo;s a whole world out there</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s go make it happen.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a great story.</p>
<p>Cause I think it really speaks to this thing</p>
<p>that you mentioned,</p>
<p>which is that when we first start to realize</p>
<p>we have a sense of self,</p>
<p>it has something to do with cause and effect on the world.</p>
<p>Like we can have an impact in some way</p>
<p>on things outside of us, outside of our home.</p>
<p>Lately, I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot of psychology</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been listening to some of your content</p>
<p>and I definitely want to talk to you about</p>
<p>a study that you covered related to these.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a brutal experiment with these kids</p>
<p>that either had stutter or didn&rsquo;t have stutter.</p>
<p>I want to get into that a little bit later,</p>
<p>but what we do and how we treat people</p>
<p>and how we receive feedback and give feedback</p>
<p>has a big impact.</p>
<p>But I think some of that happens</p>
<p>just in our own relationship to things in the world.</p>
<p>The old Hungarian psychologist I&rsquo;m learning</p>
<p>had this idea of two kinds of people.</p>
<p>They literally thought there were two kinds of people.</p>
<p>There are generators and projectors.</p>
<p>And generators are people that are just</p>
<p>from a very young age,</p>
<p>they realize they can impact other people</p>
<p>positively, negatively,</p>
<p>and they want to create things in the world.</p>
<p>They want to generate stuff.</p>
<p>And I go, wow, I can actually like build stuff</p>
<p>and break stuff and blow stuff up maybe,</p>
<p>but also help things.</p>
<p>And then there are these projectors</p>
<p>that like to just kind of reflect on what they see.</p>
<p>And they made the really important point, I think,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not the generators are good</p>
<p>and projectors are bad.</p>
<p>The world needs both,</p>
<p>that they really work in a kind of symbiotic way.</p>
<p>But your story captures the essence</p>
<p>of what it is to be a generator,</p>
<p>which is that by doing certain things,</p>
<p>you can have an impact and it feeds back to you,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s likely that they receive something</p>
<p>from it as well.</p>
<p>Yeah, and where this all came to fruition</p>
<p>as I now piece together</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re talking through this stuff,</p>
<p>look, when I joined the military,</p>
<p>you join the military and you get a blank slate.</p>
<p>So no one cares where you came from.</p>
<p>No one cares what you did.</p>
<p>You were the captain of the football team,</p>
<p>captain of the soccer team.</p>
<p>No one cares.</p>
<p>No one cares what your grades were.</p>
<p>No one cares what you got on the SATs.</p>
<p>No one cares about anything.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a blank slate.</p>
<p>And then with that blank slate,</p>
<p>it is, hey, if you do this thing,</p>
<p>if you perform this task and you perform it well,</p>
<p>you will get recognition.</p>
<p>You will get,</p>
<p>you will hopefully get more control over your own destiny,</p>
<p>which is the ultimate in compensation for human beings</p>
<p>to have more control over your own destiny</p>
<p>is the ultimate compensation.</p>
<p>You know, you and I were talking before we hit record,</p>
<p>like you can have all the money in the world,</p>
<p>but if you don&rsquo;t control what you&rsquo;re doing every day,</p>
<p>or at least you don&rsquo;t control most of what you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s not worth it.</p>
<p>The reason people try and make money</p>
<p>is so they can have more autonomy in their life.</p>
<p>And so in the military, it becomes very clear.</p>
<p>And it became very clear to me very quickly</p>
<p>that if I performed well,</p>
<p>I actually got a lot more freedom with what I did,</p>
<p>even in bootcamp.</p>
<p>You know, if you pass an inspection in bootcamp,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to redo your locker</p>
<p>or you don&rsquo;t have to make your bed again</p>
<p>because you did it right the first time.</p>
<p>And so you have an extra 15 minutes.</p>
<p>And so for me, really, that&rsquo;s when I started to realize,</p>
<p>oh, what I&rsquo;m doing right now is gonna impact</p>
<p>not only what&rsquo;s gonna happen to me in the next hour,</p>
<p>but in the next two years, three years, five years.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the biggest miss that we have</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re growing up.</p>
<p>And I know you had your challenges and tribulations</p>
<p>as you were growing up because you didn&rsquo;t realize,</p>
<p>oh, what I&rsquo;m doing right now</p>
<p>is gonna affect where I&rsquo;m gonna be in the future.</p>
<p>And it didn&rsquo;t happen until you were out of high school</p>
<p>and you went to junior college and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh, wait a second.</p>
<p>I can actually put my life together in a positive way.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re 14, you&rsquo;re thinking,</p>
<p>hey, what am I gonna do tomorrow?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically future operations</p>
<p>or what am I gonna do tomorrow?</p>
<p>I would&rsquo;ve been far ahead for me at 14.</p>
<p>I was like, where am I gonna get the slurpee?</p>
<p>Which curves am I gonna hit skateboarding?</p>
<p>And where are we gonna play video games tonight?</p>
<p>Or what girls are we gonna hang out with?</p>
<p>That was kind of the mindset at 14.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then at some point you learned and so did I,</p>
<p>oh, the actions that I take now</p>
<p>are either gonna positively impact my future</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re gonna negatively impact my future.</p>
<p>And the more I focused on doing things</p>
<p>that are gonna positively impact my future,</p>
<p>the better my life became.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a very huge lesson to learn</p>
<p>that I know I didn&rsquo;t figure out for quite some time.</p>
<p>Yeah, the idea of investments and withdrawals</p>
<p>or understanding that early in life</p>
<p>in terms of health behaviors and intellectual behaviors.</p>
<p>And your point about the military</p>
<p>is a really interesting one.</p>
<p>I never thought about the military that way,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s this blank slate when you get in there.</p>
<p>And before we started, we were talking a little bit</p>
<p>about the kinds of mindsets and people</p>
<p>that the military attracts.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d love for you to elaborate on that again.</p>
<p>You mentioned something interesting,</p>
<p>this notion of garrison,</p>
<p>interesting word in its own right.</p>
<p>What kind of people do you think the military attracts?</p>
<p>And then within the military,</p>
<p>do you start to see some kind of predictable bifurcations</p>
<p>where certain people go down one track</p>
<p>and other people go down another?</p>
<p>I have a few friends from the SEAL teams, as we both know.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve heard sometimes about the distinction</p>
<p>between officers and enlisted guys, this kind of thing.</p>
<p>But maybe the question I&rsquo;m asking</p>
<p>is more across the board for all of military</p>
<p>and really for people listening,</p>
<p>whether or not they are interested in military or not</p>
<p>for their own life.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s an interesting lesson,</p>
<p>this idea of who is attracted to the military.</p>
<p>Is it like people who want to instill order on themselves</p>
<p>or is it people who want to instill order on other people</p>
<p>or both?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a really good book.</p>
<p>And I ended up doing about four podcasts on this book,</p>
<p>which is called The Psychology of Military Incompetence.</p>
<p>And when I first saw that title-</p>
<p>What an amazing title.</p>
<p>I know, and when I first saw that title,</p>
<p>I thought to myself, oh, this is some academic</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna look at the military and bash it.</p>
<p>But I did a little research</p>
<p>and it turned out that the guy that had written the book,</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t think of his name right now,</p>
<p>he was a guy that had served in World War II, was wounded.</p>
<p>I mean, this guy understood what he was talking about.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really an obvious concept once you think about it.</p>
<p>And the basic premise is this,</p>
<p>the military, when you look at it from the outside,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s this orderly place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a place where everything has a place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a place where if you have a certain rank</p>
<p>on your shoulder, you will command respect</p>
<p>and people have to listen to you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it looks like.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an attractive place for people</p>
<p>that have an authoritarian mindset,</p>
<p>for people that wanna just, hey,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t question what I&rsquo;m saying,</p>
<p>just shut up and do what I tell you to do.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people that love that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people that wanna live like that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve worked for them, I&rsquo;ve worked for them.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve experienced those type of people throughout our lives.</p>
<p>That authoritarian mindset that just want to bark orders</p>
<p>and have people listen to them.</p>
<p>And so when they, when those people are 14 years old</p>
<p>or 16 years old or 18 years old,</p>
<p>and they look at the military and they see a uniform</p>
<p>and they see people saluting</p>
<p>and they see orders being carried out</p>
<p>and they think that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m gonna go</p>
<p>and I can get the respect that I deserve.</p>
<p>And the military certainly attracts people like that.</p>
<p>And those people that have that highly disciplined</p>
<p>and orderly mindset can do well inside the military,</p>
<p>especially in garrison.</p>
<p>And I had to, again, we were talking about this earlier,</p>
<p>the word garrison.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a civilian equivalent to this word,</p>
<p>but it basically means the non-combat situation.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re out on the parade field,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re going through schooling</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s no combat involved,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re marching, like those kinds of things,</p>
<p>we call that garrison.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the rear, it&rsquo;s not in combat.</p>
<p>And the people with an authoritarian mindset</p>
<p>actually do pretty well in garrison situations.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because things are orderly</p>
<p>and you can predict what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>And you do get a certain issue of gear</p>
<p>and that gear is gonna be delivered on time.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re gonna shoot this number of rounds</p>
<p>down at the range.</p>
<p>And everything is going to go according to plan.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what garrison is.</p>
<p>And so those people join the military,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re attracted to that,</p>
<p>and they end up doing well in peacetime.</p>
<p>Now, unfortunately for them, combat is a lot different.</p>
<p>Nothing goes the way it&rsquo;s supposed to go.</p>
<p>The bullets don&rsquo;t get delivered on time.</p>
<p>The enemy has a vote on the way things are going to unfold.</p>
<p>And you end up in combat</p>
<p>in being in very chaotic situations.</p>
<p>So the type of person that thrives in combat</p>
<p>has a more open mind, has a more flexible mind,</p>
<p>is paying more attention to the input</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re receiving.</p>
<p>As opposed to someone with an authoritarian mindset,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t listen to anybody else.</p>
<p>They make up their own mind, they bark orders.</p>
<p>With someone that has a more open mindset,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re listening, they&rsquo;re taking input,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re evolving their plan.</p>
<p>And those type of people excel in a combat situation.</p>
<p>Now, unfortunately, and this is sort of the stereotype too,</p>
<p>you take that dog of war</p>
<p>and you put him back into a garrison environment,</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t do well, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not showing up on time for the inspection.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t have his, he didn&rsquo;t get his hair cut.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t have his weapon clean</p>
<p>the way it&rsquo;s supposed to be cleaned</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s got his weapon ready for combat,</p>
<p>not ready for inspection.</p>
<p>And so you get this,</p>
<p>there are these two different types of people.</p>
<p>And of course, with those two different types of people,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s degrees going one direction or the other.</p>
<p>But what you hope for is someone</p>
<p>that can play the game on the garrison side</p>
<p>and yet when it comes time to go into combat,</p>
<p>they can also open their mind, be flexible, be creative.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what you really want,</p>
<p>is you want someone that is very good at solving problems.</p>
<p>And to do that, you need to have a creative open mind</p>
<p>to figure out how we&rsquo;re gonna deal with something.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s a stereotype.</p>
<p>The stereotype is that everyone in the military</p>
<p>is sort of robotic and falling into the hierarchy</p>
<p>and we bark orders and people follow orders.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just not true.</p>
<p>There is an element of truth to it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the whole truth.</p>
<p>And certainly, if you look at history,</p>
<p>the people that excel in combat</p>
<p>are the people that maybe have</p>
<p>a little bit of a rebellious streak,</p>
<p>people that are just more creative and more open-minded.</p>
<p>Some of my friends from the SEAL teams</p>
<p>will sometimes throw out stereotypes</p>
<p>about the different divisions in the military.</p>
<p>Is there any truth to this idea</p>
<p>that Air Force types are one way and Marines are one way</p>
<p>and Navy is one way, Army is a certain way,</p>
<p>like sort of a general contour of personality?</p>
<p>Or is that just kind of inside ball joking around?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit of both.</p>
<p>I mean, certainly the Marine Corps is steeped in tradition.</p>
<p>And if you make a guess at what a Marine,</p>
<p>when you meet or if you had to guess</p>
<p>what a Marine is gonna be like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably gonna be pretty close.</p>
<p>I mean, Marines have a incredible program</p>
<p>to indoctrinate their people</p>
<p>into the culture of the Marine Corps.</p>
<p>And the Marine Corps has an incredibly strong culture.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a powerful culture.</p>
<p>I love the Marine Corps.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with the Marine Corps a ton</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re outstanding.</p>
<p>As a generality, certainly you could make those assumptions</p>
<p>about the Marines in general.</p>
<p>Now, does that mean that every Marine is the same?</p>
<p>No, absolutely not.</p>
<p>Same thing with the Army.</p>
<p>Same thing with the Air Force.</p>
<p>Same thing with the Navy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got these kind of stereotypes</p>
<p>that exist for a reason.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s interesting too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of my friends named Ben Milligan</p>
<p>wrote an incredible book called</p>
<p>By Water Beneath the Walls,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve given him a huge hassle about</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the worst title of all time.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s certainly the best book written</p>
<p>about the SEAL teams history</p>
<p>and where the SEAL teams came from.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that I had heard from a SEAL officer</p>
<p>that had given a speech years ago</p>
<p>at his change of command.</p>
<p>And what he said was,</p>
<p>hey, listen, he was trying to emphasize</p>
<p>why the SEAL teams were good.</p>
<p>And one of the things he said was,</p>
<p>you know, in the Army,</p>
<p>and he was talking historically,</p>
<p>he goes, hey, in the Army,</p>
<p>if you start to lose a battle,</p>
<p>you can just retreat and run away.</p>
<p>In the Navy, traditionally,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re fighting on board a ship.</p>
<p>And if that ship, if we can&rsquo;t run away,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re fighting, if we lose, we die.</p>
<p>So SEALs can&rsquo;t quit.</p>
<p>It was sort of this, you know,</p>
<p>little over the top expression.</p>
<p>But when you take that a little bit further,</p>
<p>when you look at the history of the Navy,</p>
<p>if we were in the Navy 150 years ago,</p>
<p>you would have to go on deployment.</p>
<p>You would take your ship,</p>
<p>and you would sail somewhere,</p>
<p>and you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to talk to me anymore.</p>
<p>So you would have to understand</p>
<p>what it is you were trying to accomplish,</p>
<p>and then just go out there and make it happen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s decentralized command.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that exists in the SEAL teams</p>
<p>without question, very decentralized command.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the absolute strengths</p>
<p>of the SEAL teams is you&rsquo;ve got leaders</p>
<p>at every level inside the organization</p>
<p>that if they don&rsquo;t know exactly,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re not told what to do,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to go, okay, I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t been told what to do,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to go figure it out.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the strengths of the SEAL teams.</p>
<p>We also, we have more doctrine now,</p>
<p>but when I came in the SEAL teams,</p>
<p>there was no doctrine.</p>
<p>It was all word of mouth.</p>
<p>And so the Army and the Marine Corps,</p>
<p>if you have to conduct an ambush,</p>
<p>you can pull out a manual,</p>
<p>and you can look up how to conduct an ambush,</p>
<p>platoon ambush, how to conduct it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all written very clear,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re great documents.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the FM7, TAC8, Infantry, Platoon, and Squad,</p>
<p>I think is the Army doctrine.</p>
<p>I can see the little neurons in your hippocampus</p>
<p>firing and see it&rsquo;s embedded in there forever.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a great manual.</p>
<p>And you can pull that thing out</p>
<p>and you have a place to start from.</p>
<p>In the SEAL teams, we didn&rsquo;t have that at all.</p>
<p>So you would hear from your platoon chief,</p>
<p>this is how you conduct an ambush.</p>
<p>And he had heard it from his platoon chief</p>
<p>who heard it from his platoon chief</p>
<p>who heard it from his platoon chief,</p>
<p>and that platoon chief was in Vietnam.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s getting passed down,</p>
<p>but you can make adjustments to it.</p>
<p>And you can alter the plan a little bit</p>
<p>because, hey, the terrain is different,</p>
<p>or hey, the night vision we now have.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s changes that we can make</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no doctrine.</p>
<p>So not having any doctrine in many ways is a strength.</p>
<p>Also, it can be a weakness.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;ve got a new platoon commander</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s never done an ambush before,</p>
<p>and he has no idea what he&rsquo;s doing,</p>
<p>this platoon chief has been out of the loop for a long time</p>
<p>and he doesn&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s doing,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way, there&rsquo;s no reference.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses,</p>
<p>just like any characteristic, right?</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s characteristic,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got strength and you&rsquo;ve got weaknesses,</p>
<p>and your weaknesses can be strength</p>
<p>and your strength can be weaknesses.</p>
<p>To get back to your original question,</p>
<p>are there stereotypes inside</p>
<p>of each of the military branches?</p>
<p>Sure, but are there outliers</p>
<p>in each of the military branches?</p>
<p>There are absolutely,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why you can&rsquo;t judge a book by its cover.</p>
<p>For people listening to this who are not in the military,</p>
<p>maybe have some military lineage in their family or not,</p>
<p>but who want to understand a little bit better</p>
<p>about how structure and lack of structure</p>
<p>can both support being effective in life,</p>
<p>in relationships, in daily life,</p>
<p>in fitness, in business, in school,</p>
<p>I think those are the big domains, in creative endeavors.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;d be useful for them to understand</p>
<p>a little bit about how you in particular</p>
<p>balance discipline and structure</p>
<p>with, dare I say, lack of discipline and structure.</p>
<p>You could actually just say the word freedom, right?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s what it turns into.</p>
<p>Or maybe even play.</p>
<p>I bring this up in part</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve seen some posts that you put up</p>
<p>of you playing the guitar with friends or music.</p>
<p>One of them was a tribute to someone</p>
<p>who either was killed in combat or passed away.</p>
<p>So these moments of connection between people</p>
<p>sometimes are working together,</p>
<p>but sometimes are in relaxation and play</p>
<p>and these kinds of things.</p>
<p>And I think it was a really important post</p>
<p>for people to see that,</p>
<p>wow, Jocko Willink kicks back with a guitar,</p>
<p>not trying to take over stages.</p>
<p>Maybe you are, maybe you have a plan.</p>
<p>If anyone could do it, you&rsquo;d probably be the one.</p>
<p>But what is the balance for you</p>
<p>in terms of structure and lack of structure?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not going to ask for your daily routine.</p>
<p>We know that you get up early, you train,</p>
<p>but I do have some specific questions</p>
<p>that I think would be helpful in putting some meat</p>
<p>on the notions about you.</p>
<p>And again, this isn&rsquo;t to pick into your life,</p>
<p>but more to grab, well, it&rsquo;s to pick into your life.</p>
<p>So a question I asked you in the lobby,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s one that having seen your content</p>
<p>for a long time and really benefited from it,</p>
<p>I was curious, you get up early at about 4.30,</p>
<p>you train every morning, how long do you train for?</p>
<p>And is there any global structure to that?</p>
<p>And of course, everyone needs different programs,</p>
<p>but is it like weight training one day,</p>
<p>cardio training the next day?</p>
<p>Are you combining them?</p>
<p>Is it always an hour?</p>
<p>Is it always half an hour?</p>
<p>I think people would benefit</p>
<p>from getting a little bit more understanding</p>
<p>of what that looks like for you with the caveat</p>
<p>that everyone has different needs,</p>
<p>levels of background, et cetera.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m intensely curious about this</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m certain I&rsquo;m not the only one.</p>
<p>So do you want to talk about weightlifting</p>
<p>or rock and roll on the guitar?</p>
<p>I want to talk about,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk about the most structured first part of your day</p>
<p>and then let&rsquo;s talk about</p>
<p>the least structured part of your day,</p>
<p>at least the part that you can share with the world.</p>
<p>Yeah, waking up early and I&rsquo;m going to work out</p>
<p>and depending on what&rsquo;s going on that day,</p>
<p>if I have an early flight,</p>
<p>I might work out for eight minutes, right?</p>
<p>I might go in and do 2000 meters on the roller,</p>
<p>get a sweat going hard as I can,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>And cause I got to go catch a flight.</p>
<p>So that could be happening.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m supposed to go surfing in the morning.</p>
<p>I wake up, the waves are terrible.</p>
<p>And so now I&rsquo;ve got nothing to do.</p>
<p>I planned out, you know,</p>
<p>to be surfing for two or three hours</p>
<p>and now I&rsquo;m not going to go surfing.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to go,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go lift and I&rsquo;m going to go play in the gym</p>
<p>and do a bunch of stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to spend two or three hours in there.</p>
<p>I love doing that.</p>
<p>So the workout could be anywhere between what I just say,</p>
<p>eight minutes and three hours.</p>
<p>And it could be anything in between.</p>
<p>I fully enjoy the physical aspect of working out.</p>
<p>So if I have more time to spend in the gym, I&rsquo;ll spend it.</p>
<p>I remember my dad saying at one point,</p>
<p>if I retired, I wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>And I was thinking to myself, are you serious right now?</p>
<p>You know, if I didn&rsquo;t have anything to do,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d spend six hours a day in the gym.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d spend four hours doing jujitsu.</p>
<p>Like I could fill my day.</p>
<p>I could fill every day with just physical activity,</p>
<p>things that I just like doing.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s, so wake up early, get a sweat going.</p>
<p>And do I lift?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Do I do cardio?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Do I run?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Do I sprint?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Do I lift heavy weights?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Do I swing kettlebells?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I enjoy all of it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not really good at any of it.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m not really good at any one aspect</p>
<p>of physical activity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people that are infinitely better at me</p>
<p>in every aspect of, and I&rsquo;m not just talking about,</p>
<p>oh, this guy&rsquo;s a world-class lift.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s like a guy named Fred down at the gym</p>
<p>that can deadlift more than me.</p>
<p>There was a guy, when I was at SEAL Team Two,</p>
<p>there was a guy who was probably five, seven.</p>
<p>And he looked kind of chubby.</p>
<p>And he was older than me and he could run faster than me</p>
<p>and he could bench more than me.</p>
<p>Those guys are out there.</p>
<p>It was just so bothersome.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re out there.</p>
<p>They got some engine in there related to something.</p>
<p>I mean, I do think there are genetic differences</p>
<p>in terms of people&rsquo;s resilience and workout,</p>
<p>but even just grip strength is highly,</p>
<p>highly subjected to like genetic influences,</p>
<p>maximum grip strength.</p>
<p>But of course there&rsquo;s a huge range</p>
<p>in what people can develop.</p>
<p>But I guarantee your grip strength is greater than mine.</p>
<p>People ask me this all the time,</p>
<p>who would win in arm wrestling between you and Jocko?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, Jocko.</p>
<p>Who would win in Jocko?</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a lot of technique in arm wrestling.</p>
<p>I have to imagine they&rsquo;re putting their body behind it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re putting their back in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just that.</p>
<p>Like there is legitimate technique in arm wrestling.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s hope for me yet.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s no,</p>
<p>like if we could bring a female arm wrestler in here</p>
<p>that knows how to arm wrestle,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know how to arm wrestle either.</p>
<p>And she would be both of us</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot more technique in arm wrestling</p>
<p>than you know, than most people recognize.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all these little games that are going on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all this little arm position that you get.</p>
<p>So just like everything else, it&rsquo;s technique.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of technique in arm wrestling.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good to know.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that about arm wrestling.</p>
<p>I think we all start off with some genetic predispositions,</p>
<p>both good and bad for different things.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s, as far as we know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a huge range based through neuroplasticity</p>
<p>and muscle adaptation, et cetera, in what we can obtain.</p>
<p>So I never want genetic predisposition to serve as a barrier.</p>
<p>No one knows also what the upper limits</p>
<p>of any of these things are.</p>
<p>And some of the best examples we know from sport</p>
<p>and certainly from academia are people</p>
<p>who knew they were at a disadvantage</p>
<p>and just worked 10 times harder than everybody else</p>
<p>because they had an ax to grind</p>
<p>with their genetic disadvantage,</p>
<p>which is really cool at the face of it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a quick break</p>
<p>and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens, now called AG1,</p>
<p>is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink</p>
<p>that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or usually twice a day</p>
<p>is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health.</p>
<p>Our gut is very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s populated by gut microbiota</p>
<p>that communicate with the brain, the immune system,</p>
<p>and basically all the biological systems of our body</p>
<p>to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>And those probiotics in Athletic Greens are optimal</p>
<p>and vital for microbiotic health.</p>
<p>In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens,</p>
<p>vitamins, and minerals that make sure</p>
<p>that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met,</p>
<p>and it tastes great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you a year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>So you get the training,</p>
<p>and do you track your training in a detailed way?</p>
<p>Are you keeping track of lifts and-</p>
<p>So I write down what I do,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll write down what I do every day.</p>
<p>And that way I can go back and say,</p>
<p>you know, what was I doing back then?</p>
<p>Because I might go through some phase</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m trying to do more pull-ups,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m trying to deadlift more,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m trying, or whatever the thing is,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go back into,</p>
<p>because I get bored of deadlifting after a while.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, if you just want to be a good deadlifter,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to be that fast, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be slow on long runs.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t want to go too deep into deadlifting,</p>
<p>and you also don&rsquo;t want to be so good at long runs</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t deadlift, you know, a good amount of weight.</p>
<p>So I kind of go through phases,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll get into something for a while,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll get into something else.</p>
<p>So I do log down what I&rsquo;m doing,</p>
<p>so I can look back and say, oh, dang, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even close to as strong as I used to be.</p>
<p>Need to get back to that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated by the concept of energy.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s one of the most interesting aspects</p>
<p>in all of biology, all of psychology, and all of life.</p>
<p>And when I say energy, I mean the distinction</p>
<p>between being back on your heels,</p>
<p>flat-footed, or forward, center of mass, you know?</p>
<p>And I get the impression,</p>
<p>and I think everyone gets the impression,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re somebody with a lot of energy.</p>
<p>And I wonder whether or not you wake up</p>
<p>with a lot of energy,</p>
<p>and you feel like you have to burn it off</p>
<p>with this physical activity and work</p>
<p>and other demands in your life,</p>
<p>or do you find that you wake up</p>
<p>and your energy is kind of neutral,</p>
<p>and exercise and physical activity gives you energy?</p>
<p>Because I think this is one of the key things out there,</p>
<p>I think, that acts as a barrier</p>
<p>for people doing more with their body,</p>
<p>because maybe they don&rsquo;t want to tire themselves out,</p>
<p>or maybe they don&rsquo;t feel like</p>
<p>they have enough energy to begin with.</p>
<p>It also feeds into this idea that,</p>
<p>oh, you know, some people just have a lot of energy,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really physical, and other people aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just say on most days,</p>
<p>do you wake up feeling like you want to burn off energy,</p>
<p>build energy?</p>
<p>What does exercise mean to you?</p>
<p>And then maybe we can talk about</p>
<p>some of the underlying stuff going on there,</p>
<p>because I think we both might find it interesting.</p>
<p>I would say it&rsquo;s both, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way I could sit here and say,</p>
<p>oh yeah, every day that alarm clock goes off,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, oh yeah, let&rsquo;s rock and roll.</p>
<p>Certainly that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also certainly not the case that every day I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>oh God, not again.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;d say most of the time the alarm clock goes off,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think a bunch.</p>
<p>Like when my alarm clock goes off, I don&rsquo;t think a bunch.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t debate with myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not negotiating.</p>
<p>I just, the thing goes off,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m doing what I&rsquo;m supposed to do.</p>
<p>Sort of robotic.</p>
<p>Now, this much I can say.</p>
<p>When you go and work out, you&rsquo;re going to feel better.</p>
<p>You will get energy from working out.</p>
<p>That is a guarantee.</p>
<p>If you go work out, you&rsquo;re going to feel better.</p>
<p>If you go break a sweat, you&rsquo;re going to feel better.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to get more energy from it.</p>
<p>And look, you got to go really, really hard</p>
<p>to where now you feel more tired when you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>And even that, I mean, you got to go psycho.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do that occasionally,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t do that on a daily basis.</p>
<p>You know, at the end of a day, if I wake up, lift, run,</p>
<p>surf, and then I do jujitsu in the afternoon,</p>
<p>like at the end of that day, I&rsquo;m tired and I feel tired.</p>
<p>But normal day, working out just makes you feel better.</p>
<p>Definitely gives you, definitely gives me energy,</p>
<p>I should say, because I guess I&rsquo;m not everybody.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s a very important point</p>
<p>because one of the things that we are learning</p>
<p>from circadian biology, you know, time of day effects</p>
<p>and sunlight and all that stuff</p>
<p>that we talk about in our podcast</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve done intuitively, right?</p>
<p>This is what we kind of arrived to.</p>
<p>It was kind of crazy.</p>
<p>Last time we had a conversation is that so many of the things</p>
<p>that science is telling us to do</p>
<p>and that we emphasize on the podcast, this podcast,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been doing or are built into military schedules.</p>
<p>And one of them is this notion of waking up early</p>
<p>and getting physical early in the day.</p>
<p>And I suppose if we were to just throw one blanket rule</p>
<p>on the table to encompass the broadest number of themes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that once every 24 hours,</p>
<p>we each and all get a big increase</p>
<p>in this release of the hormone cortisol,</p>
<p>which everyone says, oh, cortisol, it&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s going to burn you out,</p>
<p>adrenal burnout, all that stuff.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a non-negotiable peak.</p>
<p>You want it to arrive early in the day</p>
<p>and viewing sunlight, physical activity, caffeine,</p>
<p>and in particular, intense exercise,</p>
<p>all amplify that cortisol peak.</p>
<p>In fact, I think the numbers I&rsquo;m seeing</p>
<p>is just sunlight viewing gives you a 50% increase</p>
<p>in that cortisol.</p>
<p>Exercise on top of that, another 50 to 75% increase.</p>
<p>So this huge release in this hormone</p>
<p>that everyone thinks is terrible,</p>
<p>but actually sets this huge wave in motion</p>
<p>for the rest of the day, which gives you more energy,</p>
<p>higher levels of immune function, more focus, et cetera.</p>
<p>And does indeed, as you mentioned</p>
<p>in your example of your daily life,</p>
<p>sets a timer so that about 14 to 16 hours later,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sleepy, which is what you want,</p>
<p>14 to 16 hours later, unless of course</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re running vampire shifts in the military</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re on shift work, but most people aren&rsquo;t, of course.</p>
<p>So I think the idea that movement</p>
<p>and exercise gives us energy, I think is an important idea.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something that I was, frankly,</p>
<p>I was hoping your answer would be that,</p>
<p>as opposed to that, you know, you wake up every day</p>
<p>and you just wanna just attack the world</p>
<p>because you have so much energy getting out of bed,</p>
<p>because frankly, I never feel that way.</p>
<p>But I always feel better after I train, always.</p>
<p>And of course there are times when I crash</p>
<p>in the early afternoon, if I train really, really hard,</p>
<p>but usually that&rsquo;s when I over-caffeinate</p>
<p>to an outrageous degree, and then I don&rsquo;t nourish after,</p>
<p>or I over-nourish.</p>
<p>So this is the other thing, that eating,</p>
<p>the whole rest and digesting, the digest word in there</p>
<p>is meant to, it&rsquo;s there for a reason,</p>
<p>which is that when we eat a really big meal,</p>
<p>we actually need to slow down.</p>
<p>So I hate to get into daily schedules</p>
<p>at the level of nitpicking, and nutrition</p>
<p>is about the most controversial topic on the internet.</p>
<p>But do you nourish after you train?</p>
<p>And if you do, do you do it to the point where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind of like, okay, I&rsquo;m mostly full or I&rsquo;m full.</p>
<p>Are you trying to really nourish yourself,</p>
<p>or do you find that eating slows you down?</p>
<p>I find that eating slows me down.</p>
<p>And I would say, again, it&rsquo;s weird how some of this stuff is</p>
<p>like, the main reason I got in the habit of waking up early</p>
<p>and working out is because if you do it before anyone else</p>
<p>is awake, then they can&rsquo;t bother you</p>
<p>and you can get stuff done, right?</p>
<p>You go to the SEAL team and you get there</p>
<p>before anyone else is there, no one can say,</p>
<p>hey, can you help us with this?</p>
<p>Hey, no one sent you an email, so you get that time,</p>
<p>you get it done, and it&rsquo;s yours, right?</p>
<p>I remember when you were on my podcast</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wear sunglasses when I run in the morning</p>
<p>because I sweat and it fills my sunglasses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not because I wanna let the UV light into my eyes,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not why.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not for the cortisol.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that, it&rsquo;s cool that I know it now,</p>
<p>but I just did it because I don&rsquo;t want to sweat</p>
<p>and my sunglasses can&rsquo;t see, so I just run without them</p>
<p>and put a hat on.</p>
<p>As far as eating, I don&rsquo;t like to do physically active</p>
<p>things with food in my stomach.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way it is.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t wanna, and what really keeps that in line</p>
<p>for me is I&rsquo;m doing jujitsu in the afternoon,</p>
<p>and so if I&rsquo;m eating a big lunch,</p>
<p>by the time the afternoon rolls around,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of, I got food in my gut,</p>
<p>and I just don&rsquo;t like that feeling.</p>
<p>So no, I don&rsquo;t eat a big meal until I&rsquo;m kind of done</p>
<p>with the physical stuff for the day,</p>
<p>which is usually at night, six, seven o&rsquo;clock at night,</p>
<p>which I guess there&rsquo;s some bad things about that.</p>
<p>I eat too late.</p>
<p>Well, the data say, if you&rsquo;re, yeah,</p>
<p>we could go down a rabbit hole with this</p>
<p>and then someone&rsquo;s gonna pull up</p>
<p>some little clinical study</p>
<p>and then another one that counters that.</p>
<p>I mean, I think the data essentially say</p>
<p>that having a regular meal schedule</p>
<p>that allows you to sleep well at night,</p>
<p>whatever that means for you,</p>
<p>and that allows you to be active and focused</p>
<p>when you need to be active and focused,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the ideal schedule.</p>
<p>I, when I&rsquo;m working with clients,</p>
<p>like so I have a leadership consulting company,</p>
<p>Echelon Front, when I&rsquo;m going to work with a client,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not eating.</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re gonna be asking me questions.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna be diving into what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>inside their business.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff going on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of cognitive work.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not eating before a podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not eating before a podcast.</p>
<p>Before I&rsquo;m recording a podcast, I&rsquo;m not eating</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t wanna have a bunch of food in my stomach.</p>
<p>I wanna, you get a certain level of mental clarity</p>
<p>when you haven&rsquo;t eaten a bunch of food.</p>
<p>So going out on missions,</p>
<p>I never would eat before I go out on a mission.</p>
<p>I would eat when I come home.</p>
<p>You know, you get home four o&rsquo;clock in the morning,</p>
<p>three o&rsquo;clock in the morning from doing operation,</p>
<p>cool, then I&rsquo;ll eat.</p>
<p>Because then I&rsquo;m gonna do a debrief for 15 minutes,</p>
<p>clean weapons, and then eat a big meal, go to sleep.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t wanna have food in my stomach</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;ve gotta perform or execute anything.</p>
<p>So again, I think that&rsquo;s just kind of a fluke</p>
<p>that I ended up living like that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s kind of how I live.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fortunate fluke for all of us</p>
<p>because so much of what you embody and what you do,</p>
<p>I think centers around this idea of discipline, of course,</p>
<p>but also energy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the intuitive sense I get</p>
<p>about why people are so drawn to your messaging</p>
<p>and what you do and how you do it.</p>
<p>Energy, we know, of course, is caloric energy.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what most people default to.</p>
<p>They go, oh, that, how many calories are energy</p>
<p>and how many calories in that?</p>
<p>And you need calories to fuel things.</p>
<p>But the energy that you&rsquo;re describing,</p>
<p>I think is the one that,</p>
<p>well, it really maps to Eastern traditions more directly,</p>
<p>the whole yin and yang thing.</p>
<p>Yin and yang, I always get that wrong.</p>
<p>So, which is the notion of neural energy.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a particular cluster of chemicals</p>
<p>that has a fancy name called the catecholamines,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s dopamine, epinephrine,</p>
<p>which is adrenaline, and norepinephrine.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got cortisol.</p>
<p>And those four hang out together</p>
<p>and basically give us enough energy</p>
<p>to run our brain and body for 50 days, 50 days.</p>
<p>So, the idea that you have to eat before you train,</p>
<p>sure, for some people that might work better than others.</p>
<p>But I think what people don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>is that anytime we&rsquo;re taking in caloric energy,</p>
<p>it takes neural energy in order to digest that</p>
<p>and put it into storage.</p>
<p>And so the way you describe your day of,</p>
<p>yeah, I also don&rsquo;t eat before I train.</p>
<p>I like to hydrate and caffeinate.</p>
<p>I have been drinking these before I train.</p>
<p>I have to limit myself to two before,</p>
<p>because otherwise I&rsquo;m like picking up,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m already quaking a little bit at the second one.</p>
<p>But I have a pretty high caffeine tolerance.</p>
<p>So, I like to train fasted also.</p>
<p>And then I find it gives me energy.</p>
<p>But then the moment that I eat a meal</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a little too large,</p>
<p>all of a sudden I&rsquo;m out of energy.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the deal?</p>
<p>This calories are energy, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re supposed to have energy in order to think and move.</p>
<p>I think a lot of the world has this backwards</p>
<p>and this isn&rsquo;t a push for intermittent fasting</p>
<p>or any particular style of eating really.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if people are carnivore or vegan,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter to me, whatever works.</p>
<p>I happen to be an omnivore.</p>
<p>But I think once people understand</p>
<p>that energy to do things is neural,</p>
<p>and yet of course it relies on having glycogen</p>
<p>and all this stuff around,</p>
<p>but neural energy is what it&rsquo;s really about.</p>
<p>Then your schedule and the way you function</p>
<p>and the way you describe your schedule</p>
<p>really makes a ton of sense.</p>
<p>You described getting up and lifting,</p>
<p>running, surfing, and jujitsu in the same day.</p>
<p>So on a day like that, you&rsquo;re hydrating, correct?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s vital.</p>
<p>And I know in the SEAL teams,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of discussion about hydration as important,</p>
<p>even though you guys I know are supposed to be able</p>
<p>to eat sand and survive on sunlight and dirt</p>
<p>and drink your own blood.</p>
<p>Not me.</p>
<p>Hydration&rsquo;s taken seriously, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, and different people need</p>
<p>different amount of hydration.</p>
<p>And I, unfortunately, was one of them.</p>
<p>I always needed to bring a lot of water in the field,</p>
<p>which sucked because water&rsquo;s heavy.</p>
<p>And I have friends, one of my friends, Tony,</p>
<p>BTF Tony, he&rsquo;d go in the field</p>
<p>with like a can of Copenhagen and coffee in his canteen</p>
<p>and go like three straight days.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like a desert turtle.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a desert rat, man.</p>
<p>He could just survive.</p>
<p>And I would always have to bring a ton of water.</p>
<p>I sweat a ton when I work out</p>
<p>or when I&rsquo;m doing anything that requires physical output.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna, I sweat a ton.</p>
<p>So I have to drink a lot of water for sure.</p>
<p>But not everyone&rsquo;s the same, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think if most people focused more</p>
<p>on hydration and movement,</p>
<p>they would find they have two,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna venture a guess here,</p>
<p>this is not a scientific study,</p>
<p>but two to four times more energy</p>
<p>than if they focused on caloric energy and what to eat.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think the cool thing about this,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re using the term energy.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s cool about this is you or I,</p>
<p>I create energy, right?</p>
<p>I create energy by, like I said,</p>
<p>by going to the, by going and lifting in the morning,</p>
<p>by going and doing burpees.</p>
<p>You go do burpees, you go do 100 burpees,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re creating energy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be tired, you&rsquo;re gonna be sweating,</p>
<p>but you just created energy.</p>
<p>So that stuff is totally true.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad there&rsquo;s neuroscience to back it up.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m actually thinking about</p>
<p>devoting some of my lab to this.</p>
<p>You know, one of the best examples,</p>
<p>another familiar territory for you is cold water.</p>
<p>You know, nowadays there&rsquo;s a lot about ice baths</p>
<p>and cold baths and showers and all that.</p>
<p>And I always like to just say,</p>
<p>listen, it&rsquo;s all just a reliable source</p>
<p>of inducing adrenaline release.</p>
<p>And you get out of a cold shower, you have more energy.</p>
<p>And that energy couldn&rsquo;t have been caloric energy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s adrenaline.</p>
<p>And I, you know, again, I&rsquo;m,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fair to say I&rsquo;m obsessed by the ideas of identity,</p>
<p>which is a little bit how we started off,</p>
<p>and I wanna get back to it, and energy.</p>
<p>I feel like identity and energy can account for</p>
<p>75% of what it is to, you know, live a good life,</p>
<p>if you can master those.</p>
<p>Because then it all seems to fall into bins.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, of course you need sleep, why?</p>
<p>Well, to restore your neural energy, right?</p>
<p>At some point, you just fade out of neural energy</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t sleep.</p>
<p>So sleep then falls into a particular bin</p>
<p>with a particular purpose.</p>
<p>And then exercise becomes not a way to like burn energy,</p>
<p>but as you said, to create energy.</p>
<p>And we actually are starting to understand why this is.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ll indulge me for a second on some neuroscience,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t talk about this last time.</p>
<p>We have neural circuits that control deliberate action.</p>
<p>We have neural circuits that control deliberate actions</p>
<p>that we forget that we&rsquo;re doing, like walking.</p>
<p>And then we have neural circuits</p>
<p>which are called central pattern generators.</p>
<p>And these are the neural circuits</p>
<p>that love to just work on their own,</p>
<p>and in the background, just kind of hum in the background</p>
<p>and take care of all the stuff like heartbeat, breathing,</p>
<p>and movement that is repetitive.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re just marching</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have to adjust your cadence much,</p>
<p>or maybe you&rsquo;re hiking even,</p>
<p>and step in this rock, that rock.</p>
<p>Once those central pattern generators get going,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very automatic.</p>
<p>And we know that once those central pattern generators</p>
<p>get going, there&rsquo;s the release of those catecholamines,</p>
<p>those three or four molecules</p>
<p>that then feed all the other neural systems.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called neuromodulators for a reason</p>
<p>because they set the gain higher.</p>
<p>So then you go out for a run, or a jog,</p>
<p>or a hike, or something, or you pedal, or you row,</p>
<p>and then your whole system is at a higher RPM.</p>
<p>So when you say create energy,</p>
<p>neuroscientists are starting to understand what that is,</p>
<p>repetitive movement that allows you to forget</p>
<p>the motor commands that are required</p>
<p>to generate that movement.</p>
<p>So you might think about your row stroke</p>
<p>or something like that,</p>
<p>but you can do it without thinking much.</p>
<p>You come off of that and you now are set at a higher RPM</p>
<p>to do more deliberate stuff.</p>
<p>And none of this, again, involved</p>
<p>like eating enough carbohydrates</p>
<p>or making sure you&rsquo;ve had enough ketones</p>
<p>or enough protein, like it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you got plenty of that stuff provided you nourish</p>
<p>at some point every 24 hours or so.</p>
<p>So I think we know a little bit about the science</p>
<p>behind Jocko Willink&rsquo;s schedule now,</p>
<p>but I will ask this,</p>
<p>are there certain forms of exercise</p>
<p>like weightlifting versus cardio that you find</p>
<p>give you an especially big boost</p>
<p>in what we&rsquo;re calling energy?</p>
<p>And here, this could be cognitive energy,</p>
<p>it could be physical energy,</p>
<p>but a readiness for the next thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, first, I got to back you up on this.</p>
<p>I love backing up your science.</p>
<p>So do you ever rock march,</p>
<p>like put on a heavyweight and rock?</p>
<p>Yeah, sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>Yeah, Peter Atiyah got me into this.</p>
<p>He got me into doing a long Sunday,</p>
<p>instead of a long Sunday run,</p>
<p>throwing on a lightweight vest or a rock</p>
<p>and going out for like three hours.</p>
<p>And the first 20 minutes I find,</p>
<p>I always want to go faster and get it over with.</p>
<p>But then I&rsquo;ve learned that the real pain in it</p>
<p>sets in around an hour.</p>
<p>And then the beauty sets in around 90 minutes</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like, I could do this all day, all night,</p>
<p>and I never want to stop.</p>
<p>See, that&rsquo;s when you were describing</p>
<p>how these chemicals get released.</p>
<p>And once you&rsquo;re in that automatic mode,</p>
<p>because in the SEAL teams,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing maritime operations for a month,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re going to do some kill house shooting.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re not carrying a bunch of weight.</p>
<p>And then you go out to the desert</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;re putting on 80 pounds</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going on like day one.</p>
<p>You get out there, you&rsquo;re going on an 80 pound rock march.</p>
<p>And the first freaking 17 minutes,</p>
<p>the first 23 minutes just suck.</p>
<p>They just suck.</p>
<p>And what was beautiful was by the time I was,</p>
<p>23, 24 years old, I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>oh yeah, this is going to suck for 17 minutes.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s going to be, I&rsquo;m going to be a robot</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore.</p>
<p>I can just keep going forever.</p>
<p>So it sounds like what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>is what I experienced basically my whole adult life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be a little break in period mentally</p>
<p>where you think this totally sucks.</p>
<p>And then you just can keep going</p>
<p>for a really, really long time.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not that big of a deal.</p>
<p>To your question of, is there any form of exercise</p>
<p>that gives me that energy boost?</p>
<p>I would have to say like the high intensity</p>
<p>sort of anaerobic blast,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s on the bike or on the rower</p>
<p>or swinging a kettlebell hard, something like that,</p>
<p>that last 10, 15 minutes,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really good way to peak my mentality for the day.</p>
<p>Do you do the cold water thing?</p>
<p>I mean, you certainly do a lot of it in buds.</p>
<p>I mean, do you force yourself into cold water?</p>
<p>I have a cold bath in my house and I get in every day.</p>
<p>How long are you spending in there?</p>
<p>Usually around five minutes.</p>
<p>Five minutes.</p>
<p>Before you train or after?</p>
<p>No, after.</p>
<p>So this is something I haven&rsquo;t played with yet.</p>
<p>And for me, I&rsquo;m like such a,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to make a bunch of effort for something.</p>
<p>So for me, going downstairs, getting in the ice tub,</p>
<p>and I guess you only need to do it before you work out,</p>
<p>you only go a minute, right?</p>
<p>Do a minute to three.</p>
<p>Joe and I have been texting back and forth about this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lab at Stanford, Craig Heller&rsquo;s lab</p>
<p>that works on cold and performance.</p>
<p>And the athletes at Stanford,</p>
<p>mainly the cross-country team and the football players</p>
<p>are doing cold before their training</p>
<p>because of the huge increase,</p>
<p>huge long-lasting increase in dopamine and adrenaline</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s caused by that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re finding it increases performance</p>
<p>mainly by waking people up and getting them focused.</p>
<p>It creates energy, basically.</p>
<p>And students, you know, everyone thinks they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh, athletes are all super motivated.</p>
<p>This is no pick against Stanford athletes in particular.</p>
<p>A lot of athletes are excellent at what they do</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re very lazy when they&rsquo;re not training.</p>
<p>This is true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true for all athletes, but a lot of athletes are.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re really good at resting and recovering</p>
<p>so they can train more.</p>
<p>But a lot of athletes have a hard time</p>
<p>getting into gear to train every day.</p>
<p>And the cold is a great stimulus, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a four shot of espresso kind of stimulus</p>
<p>without all the jitters.</p>
<p>I think maybe going in there for a minute</p>
<p>would be cool before a workout.</p>
<p>I will say this.</p>
<p>So I had like a long workout and it was a Saturday,</p>
<p>which means on Saturday I do jujitsu</p>
<p>kind of in the morning around 10 o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>And I had like a long workout, went for a long run.</p>
<p>It was hot and I just got in the ice bath</p>
<p>and I sat in there for like seven minutes,</p>
<p>like the deep chill.</p>
<p>I got out and then I went right to jujitsu</p>
<p>and I felt awful.</p>
<p>I felt absolutely awful, like tight, cold.</p>
<p>And it took me an extra three rounds</p>
<p>to get warmed up again.</p>
<p>So that kind of left a bad taste in my mouth</p>
<p>for pre-work icing.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m gonna try this short</p>
<p>because I was talking to another friend of mine.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, oh no, only go a minute before.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll give that a try.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s really cold, 30 seconds to a minute</p>
<p>is gonna get you this big release in adrenaline and dopamine.</p>
<p>Actually, one time I did try the chamber</p>
<p>that blasts cold air on you.</p>
<p>The cryo.</p>
<p>Yeah, the cryo.</p>
<p>And I did that for like a minute or whatever.</p>
<p>And that did make me feel pre-workout pretty good.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that the whole notion of cold for metabolism,</p>
<p>people say, well, it&rsquo;s not that big</p>
<p>of an increase in metabolism.</p>
<p>Look, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned,</p>
<p>the main function of the cold for most people</p>
<p>is going to be the discipline of doing it,</p>
<p>the sense of resilience that you can build up over time,</p>
<p>just being familiar with having an adrenaline in your system</p>
<p>and then the fact that the dopamine increases</p>
<p>are huge and long lasting.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re like 2.5X increases.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a colleague of mine at Stanford,</p>
<p>Anna Lemke runs our dual diagnosis addiction clinic.</p>
<p>She had a patient getting off cocaine addiction</p>
<p>who decided to use cold ice baths</p>
<p>as a way to kind of assist himself along the way.</p>
<p>You know, he wasn&rsquo;t getting dopamine from cocaine anymore.</p>
<p>So he decided to get it from the ice bath.</p>
<p>The difference is, is cocaine gives you these sharp increases</p>
<p>and then decreases that drop you way below baseline.</p>
<p>So what do people do?</p>
<p>They go seek more cocaine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really pernicious that way.</p>
<p>Whereas the ice bath and cold showers</p>
<p>will give this long arc lasting two to three hours or more.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really something to treasure.</p>
<p>You know, the idea that you can basically save</p>
<p>on your heating bill, you know,</p>
<p>give yourself this huge dopamine increase.</p>
<p>And I think everything points to the fact</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s healthy and good.</p>
<p>But I mean, obviously it&rsquo;s working for you</p>
<p>to do it after your training.</p>
<p>I think all the gym rats who want more hypertrophy,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to get an extra, you know,</p>
<p>eighth of an inch on their tricep or whatever.</p>
<p>They freak out because they hear</p>
<p>that it can inhibit hypertrophy.</p>
<p>And then for whatever reason, there&rsquo;s this-</p>
<p>So am I doing it wrong?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, yeah, clearly you&rsquo;re doing it right now.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think your hypertrophy is suffering.</p>
<p>I actually am of the mind that</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re training really hard, sure.</p>
<p>Getting in the cold afterwards might blunt some hypertrophy.</p>
<p>That is what the data tell us.</p>
<p>Andy Galpin&rsquo;s kind of the expert on that literature.</p>
<p>But frankly, I don&rsquo;t know anyone</p>
<p>that trains really hard with the weights</p>
<p>and then gets into the cold</p>
<p>that looks like they&rsquo;re suffering from hypertrophy.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people, however,</p>
<p>who love to point fingers at and poke at cold exposure.</p>
<p>This seems to be a big thing on social media.</p>
<p>People who don&rsquo;t like the cold</p>
<p>love to point out the studies</p>
<p>showing that the cold screws up everything.</p>
<p>And most of them look like they need</p>
<p>a few sets in the gym to me.</p>
<p>And I feel comfortable poking at them</p>
<p>because I feel like all of these are just tools, right?</p>
<p>And in any case, I&rsquo;m a big fan of deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>mostly for the neural effects.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m obsessing over this concept of energy.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something that I can&rsquo;t help but ask</p>
<p>is the cognitive side of this</p>
<p>and the effects of winning and losing.</p>
<p>So you obviously have a lot of deployments</p>
<p>and a lot of wins, whatever in the context that meant, right?</p>
<p>Kill the target, capture the hostage, et cetera.</p>
<p>And then as is the case with war,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ve been some cases of losses, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve lost people.</p>
<p>Maybe there were targets that weren&rsquo;t accomplished, right?</p>
<p>This kind of thing.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve posted about these</p>
<p>and these are always things that are hard to see,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>that you post about people that you&rsquo;ve lost, right?</p>
<p>Because first of all, these people served.</p>
<p>But second of all,</p>
<p>that things don&rsquo;t always work out</p>
<p>the way that we want it sometimes</p>
<p>to really catastrophic consequences.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a theory in biology that when we win,</p>
<p>we somehow get more energy to win more</p>
<p>through the release of, no surprise,</p>
<p>dopamine and some related molecules.</p>
<p>And in fact, testosterone in both men and women</p>
<p>is another close cousin of the dopamine system.</p>
<p>Actually released from the same general,</p>
<p>or the patterns of release are from the same general areas</p>
<p>in the brain, believe it or not, and body.</p>
<p>But when we win, we feel like we can keep going, right?</p>
<p>You look at the team that wins and it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll play another game.</p>
<p>The Superbowl winners,</p>
<p>or you imagine they&rsquo;re jumping up and down</p>
<p>and they could probably play another Superbowl.</p>
<p>Losing, we know can,</p>
<p>sure it can drop things like testosterone and dopamine</p>
<p>for some period of time.</p>
<p>But when you were in the teams,</p>
<p>what was your observation about how winning and losing</p>
<p>would impact people in the short and long-term?</p>
<p>In other words, would you observe people</p>
<p>that had a quick reset button?</p>
<p>And could you say that was terrible?</p>
<p>And then transmute, I guess I&rsquo;m getting</p>
<p>into kind of the Eastern language now,</p>
<p>convert that into energy to go do better the next time.</p>
<p>Whereas we also see people, military</p>
<p>and in the civilian world, that a loss,</p>
<p>in particular severe losses,</p>
<p>basically set them down the path of like less energy.</p>
<p>It certainly isn&rsquo;t less calories.</p>
<p>In fact, most of the time it&rsquo;s the other way.</p>
<p>They start consuming more calories</p>
<p>and that doesn&rsquo;t get them going.</p>
<p>So again, this notion of energy,</p>
<p>and now I&rsquo;m asking wins versus losses,</p>
<p>what did you observe?</p>
<p>And from the perspective of leadership</p>
<p>and maybe more importantly,</p>
<p>from the perspective of yourself,</p>
<p>how do you work with that?</p>
<p>How do you calibrate wins and losses?</p>
<p>How do you transmute losses into energy?</p>
<p>Because wins we know convert to energy,</p>
<p>but losses oftentimes can sap our energy way, way down.</p>
<p>I think to start with,</p>
<p>I think that the selection process</p>
<p>to get into the SEAL teams</p>
<p>is going to weed out a bunch of people</p>
<p>that can&rsquo;t recover very quickly from something bad.</p>
<p>So you probably heard these type of stories before,</p>
<p>the kid that was the star of the football team,</p>
<p>the star of the basketball team,</p>
<p>the captain of this, the captain of that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been winning his whole life.</p>
<p>He goes to Bud&rsquo;s and he quits.</p>
<p>Because in Bud&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re not gonna win.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re certainly not gonna win everything.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna find what you&rsquo;re not good at</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna exploit that and you&rsquo;re gonna lose.</p>
<p>This is what happens.</p>
<p>So a lot of guys that may lose</p>
<p>and it disrupts their motivation,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re probably just gonna quit.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why you get this massive attrition rate</p>
<p>with guys that are studs.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re talking division one athletes,</p>
<p>division one athlete, division one wrestlers,</p>
<p>division one football players,</p>
<p>division one runners and swimmers.</p>
<p>They all come to Bud&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>They all quit, not all of them quit,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s plenty of examples</p>
<p>of the highest level of collegiate athlete</p>
<p>in sports that translate very well</p>
<p>to what you&rsquo;re doing in basic SEAL training and they quit.</p>
<p>And sometimes it&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t know how to lose.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know how to recover from a loss.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re just, so I think already,</p>
<p>and once you get to a SEAL team,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got people that are, generally speaking,</p>
<p>gonna be pretty resilient</p>
<p>when it comes to dealing with a loss.</p>
<p>Not only that, I mean, you just get used,</p>
<p>you talk about losing people.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re friends with this guy.</p>
<p>You meet this guy in SEAL training.</p>
<p>Hey, this guy seems like a stud.</p>
<p>Oh, he&rsquo;s just gonna quit.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re gonna lose five, six, seven people, eight people.</p>
<p>People quit so fast, you don&rsquo;t even keep track of them.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re just gonna lose.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just gonna get used to it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>Now, once you&rsquo;re in the teams</p>
<p>and what you&rsquo;re talking about is,</p>
<p>now you start taking much more significant loss.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not losing a race,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re losing one of your friends.</p>
<p>And this is what, from a leadership perspective,</p>
<p>you have to pay attention to.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re a leader in any organization,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically in charge of a mob.</p>
<p>When it comes to what their morale is,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re a mob and they feed off of each other</p>
<p>just like a mob rioting in the streets,</p>
<p>going, oh, we can break this window.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s break all the windows.</p>
<p>They move this mob mentality.</p>
<p>And that happens with morale inside of a team.</p>
<p>And you as a leader can&rsquo;t get caught up with the mob.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t let that happen.</p>
<p>You have to detach yourself from the mob mentally</p>
<p>so that you don&rsquo;t get caught up in their emotions</p>
<p>and their morale.</p>
<p>Because if you get caught up in their emotions</p>
<p>and you get caught up in their morale, you can&rsquo;t correct it.</p>
<p>So we go out on a mission.</p>
<p>The mission goes great.</p>
<p>We get into a gunfight, kill a couple bad guys.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s okay, high fives.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s feeling great.</p>
<p>You come back to base.</p>
<p>Hey, we don&rsquo;t need to debrief.</p>
<p>That was perfect.</p>
<p>Hey, we don&rsquo;t need to get our gear maintained.</p>
<p>We can just go to bed.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re awesome.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when the leader has to say, oh, we&rsquo;ve got the mob</p>
<p>and the mob is becoming slightly arrogant.</p>
<p>Hey guys, real quick, that was a good op,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some things we could improve on.</p>
<p>You got to bring that mob back</p>
<p>and bring them back to center line.</p>
<p>Same thing in the other direction.</p>
<p>You go out on an operation, it doesn&rsquo;t go well.</p>
<p>You go out on an operation, you take casualties.</p>
<p>Now you come back to base.</p>
<p>You see guys moping around.</p>
<p>You see the spirit starting to break and same thing.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re part of that mob, you&rsquo;ll be with them.</p>
<p>Your morale will be breaking.</p>
<p>Your spirit will be breaking.</p>
<p>You got to look at them and say, oh, I see what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Hey guys, listen up.</p>
<p>That was tough.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t go the way we wanted it to go.</p>
<p>We need to learn some lessons.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some things I can do better.</p>
<p>What can we do better to make sure</p>
<p>that that never happens again?</p>
<p>What can we do to make sure we have the opportunity</p>
<p>to go out and avenge our brother on the battlefield?</p>
<p>What can we do to move this thing forward?</p>
<p>So as a leader, when it comes to winning and losing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re generally going to be the person</p>
<p>countering what the mob mentality is.</p>
<p>Because when the mob starts winning,</p>
<p>they want to keep winning and they might get arrogant.</p>
<p>When the mob is losing, they might start to lose more</p>
<p>because their attitude goes down the drain.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what you have to pay attention to</p>
<p>from a leadership perspective.</p>
<p>For me personally, I think,</p>
<p>I know what I did when I lost guys</p>
<p>was focus on, all right, we need to celebrate the life.</p>
<p>We need to mourn the loss.</p>
<p>And then we need to go to work.</p>
<p>We need to get our gear back on.</p>
<p>We need to lock and load our weapons.</p>
<p>We need to get back out there.</p>
<p>I know that that&rsquo;s what we need to do.</p>
<p>You know, so often,</p>
<p>the best way to contend with problems,</p>
<p>with issues, with adversity is action,</p>
<p>is by taking action.</p>
<p>The more you sit and the more you wait</p>
<p>and the more time you spend with that adversity,</p>
<p>with the upper hand inside your head,</p>
<p>the worse it&rsquo;s going to get.</p>
<p>So for me, always taking action, making something happen.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be huge.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be some mammoth triumph</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to go and pursue.</p>
<p>But if you say, hey, listen, this is what happened.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t go the way we wanted it to.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to get our gear back on.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to go back out.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to do this other mission.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I think.</p>
<p>I think taking action,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s in your personal life too.</p>
<p>You know, something doesn&rsquo;t go the way you wanted it to go.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t get the job you wanted.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t get the hire.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t get the promotion.</p>
<p>You can go home and sit there and dwell on it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not getting you any progress.</p>
<p>Or you say, okay, you know what?</p>
<p>Let me do a quick analysis.</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t I get that promotion?</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s because I didn&rsquo;t get this qualification</p>
<p>or I hadn&rsquo;t jumped through this gate.</p>
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
<p>What do I need?</p>
<p>Let me look into how do I get to jump through that gate</p>
<p>so next time I will get the promotion</p>
<p>and you start taking action.</p>
<p>So action for me is a cure</p>
<p>for a lot of problems that we have in life.</p>
<p>I love this because the image that&rsquo;s arising in my mind,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll share it with you and tell me where it agrees with</p>
<p>and maybe violates what you&rsquo;re telling me.</p>
<p>But what I was imagining</p>
<p>when you were talking about leadership and the mob</p>
<p>is, you know, a bunch of candles, but not wax candles.</p>
<p>These are oil candles.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re talking about a win.</p>
<p>So, you know, it could be an op, go out and win.</p>
<p>It could be a team.</p>
<p>It could be an individual taking an exam</p>
<p>and they get an A plus.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter, but they&rsquo;re riding high.</p>
<p>I mean, those wins we know crank up those catecholamines.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s as if the intensity</p>
<p>that flame starts going up as a consequence, that&rsquo;s natural.</p>
<p>But the oil in the candle is continuing to burn down.</p>
<p>Like you need to celebrate wins,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re burning that oil.</p>
<p>And so what we&rsquo;re really talking about here</p>
<p>is how to moderate and then reclaim energy.</p>
<p>And I was imagining you as the leader who&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>okay, guys, great.</p>
<p>But listen, you&rsquo;re burning that oil, right?</p>
<p>That oil is what got you the win.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not just clamp it like we can do a few fist bumps</p>
<p>and maybe celebrate in some other ways,</p>
<p>but then let&rsquo;s take the energy we got</p>
<p>and put it to the next thing rather than just go crazy.</p>
<p>Drugs of abuse, in particular,</p>
<p>drugs that tap into the dopamine system,</p>
<p>namely cocaine and amphetamine.</p>
<p>And just because there&rsquo;s no way to avoid this</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re being true to the biology,</p>
<p>the energy, the dopamine system was designed</p>
<p>for foraging for all sorts of things.</p>
<p>Food, so people that overindulge food or seek out food.</p>
<p>Sex, people that overindulge in these things.</p>
<p>Those things, and again,</p>
<p>this sort of leans to Eastern philosophy a bit,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s Western neuroscience or neuroscience,</p>
<p>we should just say, to support it.</p>
<p>You start to deplete these dopamine systems.</p>
<p>The baseline starts to drop.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m imagining that the leader, you in this case,</p>
<p>is saying like, listen, let&rsquo;s tone it down,</p>
<p>use the energy that we&rsquo;ve gained and put it to good use</p>
<p>rather than just burn it up, enjoying it.</p>
<p>And then of course, after a loss when those,</p>
<p>I sort of think of the candles going dimmer.</p>
<p>But the oil reserve is still there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, how do you start to tap back</p>
<p>into the oil reserve?</p>
<p>Well, you have to actually ramp the candle up again.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just sit there waiting</p>
<p>for the intensity of the flame to come back.</p>
<p>You actually have to do something</p>
<p>in order for that to happen.</p>
<p>So maybe this isn&rsquo;t the best analogy</p>
<p>because it lacks sort of like the,</p>
<p>exactly what is the person turning the intensity</p>
<p>up and down on these candles.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what comes to mind.</p>
<p>And in Eastern traditions, there&rsquo;s this idea of chi,</p>
<p>of energy, energy to fight, energy to seek mates,</p>
<p>energy to seek food, energy for sex,</p>
<p>energy for all of it is the same energy.</p>
<p>And I actually believe that the energy</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re referring to are these catecholamines.</p>
<p>I really do.</p>
<p>Now there are other energy systems too,</p>
<p>relating to child rearing, pair bonding, oxytocin,</p>
<p>all the kind of like fuzzy warm stuff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s super important.</p>
<p>I mean, we wouldn&rsquo;t exist as a species the way we do</p>
<p>if we didn&rsquo;t honor that energy system also.</p>
<p>And that energy system that we normally think of as love,</p>
<p>as opposed to forward center of mass,</p>
<p>synergizes with this system, right?</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re working with and training with</p>
<p>and people that you love, this could be your brothers,</p>
<p>your sisters, whatever, your family,</p>
<p>there is, I think there&rsquo;s an amplifying effect</p>
<p>on this whole thing, right?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s just for more dopamine, just for more money,</p>
<p>just for more wins, just for more trophies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never forget this as an aside,</p>
<p>when I was a kid, I had this weird experience</p>
<p>where Tony Hawk&rsquo;s dad rescued me</p>
<p>from a skateboard contest in Linda Vista,</p>
<p>the Linda Vista Boys Club, everyone else left.</p>
<p>I was left there alone, I was 14</p>
<p>because of my home life at that time, et cetera.</p>
<p>And he was like, where are you going?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m gonna take the bus to Lancaster.</p>
<p>I know this guy.</p>
<p>And he was like, no, no, you&rsquo;re coming to our house.</p>
<p>I was like, okay.</p>
<p>So he took me at Tony&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>and I went into Tony&rsquo;s room that he had grown up in.</p>
<p>Tony lived in Fallbrook at that time.</p>
<p>And the room wasn&rsquo;t filled with trophies.</p>
<p>The room was trophies.</p>
<p>And I remember just thinking like, holy cow.</p>
<p>Like, and when I think about that</p>
<p>and I think about what a healthy person</p>
<p>Tony turned out to be,</p>
<p>because I happened to be blessed to know him a little bit,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing because a lot of people</p>
<p>that had those trophies, whatever domain of life,</p>
<p>they converted all that into ways</p>
<p>to just burn the oil down in their candle.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a guy who&rsquo;s still going in his fifties, right?</p>
<p>So, hey man, that&rsquo;s a little aside story,</p>
<p>but I think this notion of energy to me is so important</p>
<p>because as you said, when we move toward action</p>
<p>and we complete something,</p>
<p>the oil in that candle starts to get replenished</p>
<p>and the flame burns hotter.</p>

<p>that analyzes data from your blood and DNA</p>
<p>to help you better understand your body</p>
<p>and help you reach your health goals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been a believer in getting regular blood work done</p>
<p>for the simple reason that many of the factors</p>
<p>that impact your immediate and long-term health</p>
<p>can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.</p>
<p>The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,</p>
<p>however, is that you get data back about metabolic factors,</p>
<p>lipids and hormones and so forth,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t know what to do with those data.</p>
<p>InsideTracker solves that problem</p>
<p>and makes it very easy for you to understand</p>
<p>what sorts of nutritional, behavioral,</p>
<p>maybe even supplementation-based interventions</p>
<p>you might want to take on</p>
<p>in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors,</p>
<p>hormones, lipids and other things</p>
<p>that impact your immediate and long-term health</p>
<p>to bring those numbers into the ranges</p>

<p>What you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m very interested in this now,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know if this has already been measured or not,</p>
<p>but what essentially we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>is a confidence level, right?</p>
<p>So if I go out and win, I feel good about it.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m doing a jujitsu tournament</p>
<p>and the first match I go out there</p>
<p>and I submit the guy in 30s,</p>
<p>take him down, submit him in 30 seconds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling like confident, right?</p>
<p>So what does that mean?</p>
<p>My dopamine is up because I got that victory.</p>
<p>My testosterone is up because I got that victory.</p>
<p>My confidence is up because I got that victory.</p>
<p>Same thing, other direction.</p>
<p>If I go out first match and I lose to somebody,</p>
<p>my dopamine goes down, that chemical thing goes down,</p>
<p>my confidence goes down.</p>
<p>And what I have to do is I have to learn</p>
<p>how to maintain a level of confidence</p>
<p>because if I get overconfident,</p>
<p>if I win that first match, win the second match,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna kill this next guy</p>
<p>and I go out and I&rsquo;m sloppy and I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I get caught.</p>
<p>If I get totally, if I lack confidence,</p>
<p>I go out there and there&rsquo;s nothing I&rsquo;m able to do</p>
<p>to beat this guy that&rsquo;s gonna be horrible.</p>
<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m gonna get smashed.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a similar thing that we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>I just wonder how much, if you start measuring,</p>
<p>because they say, hey, if you win,</p>
<p>your testosterone goes up, right?</p>
<p>And then if you win more, your testosterone goes up high,</p>
<p>your dopamine goes up high.</p>
<p>Your confidence is going up,</p>
<p>but you can get to a point where your confidence is too high</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;re getting sloppy and now you don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>You mentioned cocaine.</p>
<p>You see like videos of people that are all coked up</p>
<p>and they, hey, I can do this.</p>
<p>They think they can do everything.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re overconfident, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re over, they think they can kick your ass.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like too much dopamine, too much ego,</p>
<p>too much confidence.</p>
<p>The other side of the spectrum is someone</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s on some kind of downer drug</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t feel like they can do anything.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re lethargic, their confidence is low</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just depressed.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an interesting tie-in between dopamine,</p>
<p>ego, confidence, and probably testosterone</p>
<p>that you get from winning and from losing.</p>
<p>And once again, as a leader, from a leadership perspective,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get wrapped up in that.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t get wrapped up in that.</p>
<p>You have to detach from it.</p>
<p>You have to be able to take a step back.</p>
<p>And then if you&rsquo;re good, even as a competitor,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll say, oh yeah, that last match was easy,</p>
<p>but I need to prepare for the next match.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t bring over confidence.</p>
<p>Look, I don&rsquo;t want a lack of confidence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a balance, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that flame on the oil burning lamp</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>You want that steady flame.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want too much getting to burn out of control.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want too little, the flame will go out.</p>
<p>Yeah, earlier we talked about this notion</p>
<p>that some of these older Hungarian psychologists had,</p>
<p>which this notion of generators versus projectors.</p>
<p>And their idea was that people sort of divide</p>
<p>into these different categories and the world needs both.</p>
<p>That one is better than the other,</p>
<p>but the world absolutely needs both.</p>
<p>And there is this idea now based on some neuroscience</p>
<p>and some other psychology that I&rsquo;ve been kind of</p>
<p>lathing into, which is that generators</p>
<p>know how to tap into the system and they love this system.</p>
<p>I think back to your story about being taken</p>
<p>to shop for pants and it turns out to be a trip to shop</p>
<p>for a number of different experiences for you, right?</p>
<p>A really telling experience.</p>
<p>Having an action effect on the world</p>
<p>and something coming back to you</p>
<p>that still sits with you inside.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s a dopamine circuit there</p>
<p>still related to this young woman</p>
<p>or then a young woman at that time.</p>
<p>Some people are generators and I think that they</p>
<p>are more attuned to this dopamine system.</p>
<p>And so as we&rsquo;re having this conversation,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that about the estimate is that</p>
<p>somewhere between 50 and 65% of people are going,</p>
<p>yeah, I get it.</p>
<p>More workouts is gonna give me more energy.</p>
<p>I need to do more of that.</p>
<p>I need to, when I&rsquo;m back on my heels,</p>
<p>I need to think about the things I can complete, et cetera.</p>
<p>And then the other 45% or so or 35% might be saying,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really get it.</p>
<p>Now the idea is that the projectors</p>
<p>can tap into these same circuits.</p>
<p>Everyone has these catecholamine circuits,</p>
<p>dopamine, et cetera,</p>
<p>but that they tend to be more of observers in the world</p>
<p>and they like being partnered with</p>
<p>and symbiotic with these people.</p>
<p>Now this starts to take on kind of like</p>
<p>stereotypical masculine feminine things,</p>
<p>but this exists on both sides.</p>
<p>It really does.</p>
<p>There might be some biases, right, by biological sex.</p>
<p>There may not be, right?</p>
<p>We could argue that it&rsquo;s probably an argument</p>
<p>that will get us into more trouble than to answers.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>The point is that some people are perfectly happy</p>
<p>to be in the company of people winning</p>
<p>because they feel good to see other people winning.</p>
<p>They like to be a support staff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes them feel good.</p>
<p>Other people would rather stick hot forks in their eyes</p>
<p>than not be the person engaged in the activity.</p>
<p>Maybe not every activity, but the activity.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about the generators and the projectors.</p>
<p>I think that in the context of moderating these systems,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so key.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s key to have a long arc in a career path,</p>
<p>military science, or otherwise.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s key in every domain of life.</p>
<p>And I think for me,</p>
<p>one thing that I&rsquo;ve learned both the hard way</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve also benefit from the positive experience of,</p>
<p>I think in relationships,</p>
<p>this could be romantic relationships,</p>
<p>but also friendships and in family,</p>
<p>because there are generators and projectors</p>
<p>almost always in those kind of symbiotic relationship,</p>
<p>romantic couple or a family that,</p>
<p>some kids are more generators,</p>
<p>some are more projectors just by something, who knows?</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s hardwired, maybe not.</p>
<p>As the leader of your family,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to assume one of the two leaders,</p>
<p>but as a leader in your family,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to make any assumptions here,</p>
<p>as the leader of your family,</p>
<p>and also as a father in particular,</p>
<p>how do you apply these same sorts of ideas</p>
<p>when your kid is kind of down</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s hard to be a 14-year-old</p>
<p>or because it was a bad day or when they&rsquo;re up, right?</p>
<p>I think the upstates are as interesting as the downstates.</p>
<p>Like, yes, like got the degree, got the win.</p>
<p>How much do you let them celebrate before you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>hey, listen, you just got yourself</p>
<p>another couple milliliters of oil in your candle.</p>
<p>What are you going to do with that?</p>
<p>You going to burn it or are you going to save it</p>
<p>for the next thing so you can climb the staircase?</p>
<p>Well, clearly it&rsquo;s a very similar thing</p>
<p>to what I just talked about.</p>
<p>You know, if your kid is doing well</p>
<p>and wins the wrestling tournament and is like,</p>
<p>yeah, I won the wrestling tournament</p>
<p>and what do they want to do?</p>
<p>They want to eat a triple cheese pizza, right?</p>
<p>I mean, they want to go crazy.</p>
<p>And you as a leader and as a parent and as a friend</p>
<p>need to say, hey man, I mean, you did good.</p>
<p>That was awesome.</p>
<p>You had a great day.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s start thinking a little bit about next week too.</p>
<p>How about we just have a few slices of pizza, right?</p>
<p>As a reward.</p>
<p>So this is the same in any situation</p>
<p>that you could be in interacting with other human beings.</p>
<p>You want to be the person that kind of modulates</p>
<p>the confidence and the ego or the way you put it,</p>
<p>you know, the dopamine and the celebratory activities.</p>
<p>So no matter who you are,</p>
<p>and this goes with yourself as well.</p>
<p>You know, you do something, you have a success</p>
<p>and you say, oh, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>But all glory is fleeting and I need to get back to work.</p>
<p>And look, and do people go too far with that sometimes?</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>Sometimes people, they don&rsquo;t stop and celebrate at all.</p>
<p>And those are the kinds of people</p>
<p>I think that get burned out eventually</p>
<p>because they never say, hey, that was awesome.</p>
<p>We had a big win.</p>
<p>Cool, high five.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t even say that.</p>
<p>So I think, you know, as a leader, as a friend,</p>
<p>as a parent, as a spouse,</p>
<p>you want to be able to modulate that, help modulate that.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t shut it down.</p>
<p>You know, your kid walks off the wrestling mat</p>
<p>for a high five and you say, you could have won by more.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not talking about that.</p>
<p>Or your kid walks off the mat after losing,</p>
<p>you say, you got what you deserve.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;ve got to be the counter,</p>
<p>the counterweight to the emotions that other people have.</p>
<p>And I think that when you&rsquo;re doing a good job</p>
<p>as a leader, as a friend, as a spouse or whatever,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing a good job as a counterweight.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a good way to look at it.</p>
<p>You want to provide some balance for people</p>
<p>to make sure that they don&rsquo;t get out of control.</p>
<p>And you notice when people have a downfall,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s normally because they&rsquo;ve surrounded themselves</p>
<p>with people that there&rsquo;s no counter to,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no counterbalance.</p>
<p>You know, if you were my best friend</p>
<p>and I went out drinking last night and had a great time</p>
<p>and partied all night and met a girl and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>heck yeah, let&rsquo;s do it again tonight.</p>
<p>Eventually, where are we going to be?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to be in the gutter somewhere.</p>
<p>But if you say, hey, dude, that was awesome.</p>
<p>But hey, remember we got school on Monday, right?</p>
<p>And you kind of pull me back.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, we got to find balance in life and ourselves.</p>
<p>And then we got to, as much as we can,</p>
<p>provide balance for other people</p>
<p>because people are emotional</p>
<p>and they get caught up in what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And you want to keep people balanced.</p>
<p>I think one of the reasons people are really drawn</p>
<p>to your message, and I put myself in that category.</p>
<p>And I remember 2014 was a very different picture for me.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter what the contour was,</p>
<p>but was things were working,</p>
<p>but they weren&rsquo;t working the way I wanted them to.</p>
<p>And I remember arriving at your content first</p>
<p>through the Tim Ferriss podcast,</p>
<p>then eventually the Jocko Willing podcast,</p>
<p>Joe Rogan podcast.</p>
<p>Those are the big two ones that kind of like</p>
<p>introduced me to you and your content.</p>
<p>And it was really a case of,</p>
<p>at the time I didn&rsquo;t have a lot of friends</p>
<p>that were doing similar things to me</p>
<p>or that matched my daily routines in a way that,</p>
<p>I could kind of synergize with in this way.</p>
<p>I think one reason why you are so helpful to people</p>
<p>is that not everybody has these friends.</p>
<p>You can have the friend that&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go out and tie one on again.</p>
<p>A lot of people don&rsquo;t even have that friend</p>
<p>or they have a friend,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not really close with that person.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some ideas nowadays about,</p>
<p>like 80% of males don&rsquo;t have a close friend</p>
<p>that they could call.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m guessing girls and women feel the same too,</p>
<p>that a lot of stuff is superficial</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of communication,</p>
<p>but not a lot of connection, right?</p>
<p>And so I think that you and a few other people</p>
<p>in the, let&rsquo;s call it social media public face,</p>
<p>public facing space,</p>
<p>serve as archetypes of like the friend</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to tell you when you&rsquo;re up, great,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s clamp it after a while</p>
<p>or that when you&rsquo;re down, let&rsquo;s get going.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s how you get going.</p>
<p>And so I do want to highlight that</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s really important and it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>but one reason why people are drawn to your message</p>
<p>and the message of some other people</p>
<p>who are out there trying to do similar things,</p>
<p>but you in particular,</p>
<p>because yes, you have this military background,</p>
<p>very intense military background, wartime background,</p>
<p>but also you bring it into the daily routines</p>
<p>that certainly apply to everybody.</p>
<p>Most everybody can access non-heated water, right?</p>
<p>One would hope.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another dimension to this</p>
<p>that I want to just bring up and get your reflections on</p>
<p>as it relates to military work, school, relationship,</p>
<p>family, et cetera,</p>
<p>which is this somewhat counterintuitive idea,</p>
<p>but then once you hear it, it makes perfect sense,</p>
<p>which is that even though the catecholamines</p>
<p>are responsible for drive</p>
<p>and that that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re really about</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re forward center of mass</p>
<p>and we have to control the level,</p>
<p>the intensity of the candle and the level of the oil.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what those actually map to exactly.</p>
<p>We could probably figure it out if we really parsed it,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the idea here, the analogy.</p>
<p>In a kind of surprising way,</p>
<p>we know that for sure one way to restore levels</p>
<p>of motivation, drive, enthusiasm,</p>
<p>and to some degree confidence that things could be different</p>
<p>is through deep rest, things like sleep, right?</p>
<p>When things are really, really hard,</p>
<p>when kids are just like, they&rsquo;re like falling apart,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s like you put them to sleep,</p>
<p>they wake up and they&rsquo;re like delightful.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like running around in their pajamas</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re little and a teenager wakes up</p>
<p>after a good night&rsquo;s sleep,</p>
<p>they might be a little like surly, but we&rsquo;re back.</p>
<p>Adults are like this.</p>
<p>The world is falling apart.</p>
<p>You go to sleep, wake up, okay,</p>
<p>I might be able to manage this kind of mindset.</p>
<p>So sleep and then the other one is we know that play,</p>
<p>the sort of the kind of physical activity</p>
<p>or mental activity where it might be a little competitive,</p>
<p>but the stakes are low.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really more about connection with the activity</p>
<p>or connection with somebody else.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re gonna play a game of whatever,</p>
<p>you know, I won&rsquo;t play chess with Lex</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;ll kick my ass.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t do jujitsu with either of you</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ll beat me up.</p>
<p>Both of you kindly, but you&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>But, you know, like we were to play a game,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just us, yeah, we might be a little competitive,</p>
<p>but the stakes are low, right?</p>
<p>We know that play and social connection and sleep</p>
<p>are basically the reservoir or the location that you go</p>
<p>to refill the oil in the candle every single time.</p>
<p>And so for you,</p>
<p>where do those things play into your routine?</p>
<p>You know, you mentioned you can go hard all day</p>
<p>and then in the evening,</p>
<p>is it dinner with family typically if you&rsquo;re at home?</p>
<p>And what does that look like?</p>
<p>I know we&rsquo;re kind of parsing it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to carve into your personal life too deeply.</p>
<p>Obviously there are boundaries there,</p>
<p>but what does that look like?</p>
<p>Is it everyone at the table phones away</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re talking about the day or is it, you know,</p>
<p>yeah, share with us a little bit of what that looks like.</p>
<p>Cause I think it is an important contour</p>
<p>to what you&rsquo;re about and what we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>that most people just don&rsquo;t have a window into.</p>
<p>Yeah. So, well, first of all, I mean,</p>
<p>just the refilling the tank with games.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what jujitsu is, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to go and you&rsquo;re going to have social connection</p>
<p>with people.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to talk to people that you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to joke about whatever,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re going to roll.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have a good time rolling.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to get a little sweat on,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to feel good.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;re going to high five.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s huge, that that&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>And your brain is kind of off, you know, when you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re training jujitsu at a certain level,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to be thinking anymore.</p>
<p>Same thing with surfing.</p>
<p>You go surfing and you catch a wave.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re not thinking about,</p>
<p>oh, I need to put my balance over here.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s happening and you&rsquo;re having a good time.</p>
<p>So I would say that restoration for me</p>
<p>comes from those two things for sure.</p>
<p>And then, yeah, I mean, my wife and my kids,</p>
<p>when I get home, my kids are older now</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re out of the house except for one.</p>
<p>And when I was in the Navy, when they were young,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t around at all.</p>
<p>You know, there wasn&rsquo;t any,</p>
<p>like we would rarely have dinner together</p>
<p>because I was gone, coming home late.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re working all the time.</p>
<p>You can never get all your work done.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m training jujitsu.</p>
<p>Like it was, we rarely ate dinner as a family</p>
<p>when I was in the teams.</p>
<p>And now when I&rsquo;m home and we can eat together for sure,</p>
<p>you know, my daughter that&rsquo;s still at home,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s going to, you know,</p>
<p>we sit out there and eat dinner</p>
<p>and talk about just normal things that people talk about,</p>
<p>like, you know, how to conduct a night ambush or,</p>
<p>no, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about normal, you know, daily things</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And, you know, my daughter that&rsquo;s, she&rsquo;s 13 right now.</p>
<p>And she talks to me about all kinds of stuff, you know,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m definitely enjoying that aspect</p>
<p>of being around more than I was when I was in the teams.</p>
<p>And I just, we didn&rsquo;t have dinner.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>So I would take my kids to jujitsu.</p>
<p>I taught jujitsu classes when I could,</p>
<p>when I was in the teams.</p>
<p>Would do like workouts with them in the morning</p>
<p>if I had time, on the weekends for sure.</p>
<p>Stuff like that with my kids.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of what I did.</p>
<p>But now, yeah, we, my wife is awesome.</p>
<p>And she is a great cook now</p>
<p>because when we first got married, it was questionable.</p>
<p>I just was harassing her about this the other day.</p>
<p>Like she got, she&rsquo;s an unbelievable cook now</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>And when we first met, by her own admission,</p>
<p>she will tell you she was not, she&rsquo;s from England, right?</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re just not cooking what we&rsquo;re liking.</p>
<p>No, the food over there, at least when I was growing up</p>
<p>and the few times I made it over there,</p>
<p>the food was pretty dreadful.</p>
<p>I mean, there were some exceptions to that,</p>
<p>but, and they drank a lot over there.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been to some scientific meetings over there</p>
<p>where they would start with like sherry in the afternoon</p>
<p>and then beer after work.</p>
<p>It was outrageous.</p>
<p>I mean, the amount of alcohol intake was just absurd.</p>
<p>Sorry, Brits.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m not trying to, I did an episode on alcohol.</p>
<p>A lot of people were angry about that episode</p>
<p>because it basically said,</p>
<p>once you get past two drinks a week,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re starting to head into territory</p>
<p>that can deplete your health.</p>
<p>So you gotta do a lot of other things to offset it,</p>
<p>but they drink a lot.</p>
<p>Yeah, the Brits drink a lot.</p>
<p>I have spent time over there with my father-in-law,</p>
<p>my brother-in-law, and we definitely drank a lot.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m glad I don&rsquo;t live there and had to drink with them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad I don&rsquo;t have to drink with them all the time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d probably be dead.</p>
<p>You were straight edge growing up, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, when I was a kid</p>
<p>and then when I joined the Navy, I started drinking.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of the culture that I bought into.</p>
<p>And I wanted to be a good SEAL.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m looking around at the guys</p>
<p>that were considered good SEALs.</p>
<p>Oh, so we&rsquo;re drinking?</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I did.</p>
<p>I think my looking back now,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really, I didn&rsquo;t think of it</p>
<p>as a big deal at the time.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t like, well, first of all,</p>
<p>even when I was growing up and I didn&rsquo;t drink</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t smoke, didn&rsquo;t do drugs,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t like a guy putting an X on my hand.</p>
<p>Although my friends and I, we all didn&rsquo;t drink, didn&rsquo;t smoke.</p>
<p>So we definitely, look, I was listening to minor threat</p>
<p>when I was a kid.</p>
<p>I mean, I get it.</p>
<p>But I wasn&rsquo;t a guy running around</p>
<p>telling everyone I was straight edge, you know?</p>
<p>But I was on that path for sure.</p>
<p>And then when I got in the SEAL teams,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, okay, this is a different culture.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not used to it.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really even understand what drinking was.</p>
<p>I mean, I never had been drunk.</p>
<p>So got in the SEAL teams.</p>
<p>I was like, okay, well, you know,</p>
<p>once I turned 21, okay, this is,</p>
<p>hey, these guys, we&rsquo;re gonna have fun.</p>
<p>And I kind of just, okay, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And then I drank a ton while I was in the SEAL teams.</p>
<p>And then as I, man, I retired from the SEAL teams</p>
<p>and went out, we basically went to every bar</p>
<p>that we would normally go to as SEALs.</p>
<p>I think we closed out the night at the Packed Shores in OB.</p>
<p>And went home that morning.</p>
<p>I woke up the next morning, worked out.</p>
<p>And then I just kind of stopped drinking</p>
<p>because, and now I just definitely,</p>
<p>I mean, now I just don&rsquo;t really drink anymore.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>Yeah, when I had my lab in San Diego for five years,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where my lab started.</p>
<p>I definitely saw a lot of team guys in bars.</p>
<p>You guys would come in and take over bars.</p>
<p>These were literal takeovers.</p>
<p>You basically, I wouldn&rsquo;t leave</p>
<p>because I wouldn&rsquo;t like give them the satisfaction</p>
<p>or me the dissatisfaction, but it was a little frustrating.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re in there, you&rsquo;re having a decent time.</p>
<p>And then just this enormous pack of team guys comes in</p>
<p>and sort of like, all right,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s time to close out the night, you know?</p>
<p>Sometimes, I was friends with enough of them that, you know,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re not really a part of it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not really a part of it.</p>
<p>And I always knew that and understood that.</p>
<p>One thing that I think really comes through now,</p>
<p>especially, but throughout our discussion</p>
<p>and all the things I&rsquo;ve seen of you,</p>
<p>and it gets me back to this thing</p>
<p>that came up at the beginning,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d really like to return to,</p>
<p>is that you seem to have a very strong</p>
<p>sense of context and self.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just say it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a psychologist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not here to play one,</p>
<p>but you know, what you just described was that,</p>
<p>okay, in one context, you know,</p>
<p>it made sense to be straight edge.</p>
<p>I mean, you mentioned minor threat, great band,</p>
<p>but when it came time to,</p>
<p>you know, you run around with your friends then,</p>
<p>and it made sense to be, you know,</p>
<p>without alcohol or drugs or anything at that stage.</p>
<p>And then you get into another context.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, I can do this.</p>
<p>I can drink and still perform well</p>
<p>and do all the things I need to do.</p>
<p>And then when that closes out,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do something else.</p>
<p>And some people are like that</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re kind of a chameleon, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re switching themselves depending on the context,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re kind of getting accents</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re in one location or another,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not you at all.</p>
<p>I can tell with certainty that&rsquo;s not you at all,</p>
<p>that there seems to be a very strong sense of self</p>
<p>so that when we have a sense of self that&rsquo;s firm,</p>
<p>we can go into different contexts.</p>
<p>We can even change our behavior,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t lose who we are,</p>
<p>which means we can always return to it.</p>
<p>The image in my mind is like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a little bit of scuba diving, not a lot,</p>
<p>but during some of the more advanced training for us,</p>
<p>sorry, this wasn&rsquo;t SEAL training, of course,</p>
<p>was, you know, following a line in the dark,</p>
<p>like a night dive, and you&rsquo;re following a line.</p>
<p>And, you know, sometimes you&rsquo;re navigating with tools,</p>
<p>but sometimes you&rsquo;re following a line underwater.</p>
<p>And this idea that like, you can let go of that line,</p>
<p>but you remember where it is, you can return to it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of how I imagine the sense of self</p>
<p>because in different contexts,</p>
<p>most healthy people modify themselves a little bit.</p>
<p>We act differently at a wedding or a funeral</p>
<p>than we do in class or out, you know, with our friends.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s an important part of being a human,</p>
<p>a functional human.</p>
<p>So it seems to me that from a pretty early stage,</p>
<p>you had a pretty good sense of self.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know if you sit in your room and meditate</p>
<p>on like, who is Jocko Willink,</p>
<p>and like touch that central cord of self.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But as I say this, I have to ask,</p>
<p>was there something in your upbringing, your parents,</p>
<p>or was it just kind of how you always imagined yourself</p>
<p>as like, yeah, this is who I am.</p>
<p>Like, no matter what happens around me,</p>
<p>like, I kind of know who I am.</p>
<p>Even if I&rsquo;m engaging in some of the behaviors</p>
<p>that I might not do in another context,</p>
<p>I know who I am.</p>
<p>Because I actually think that many people</p>
<p>do not have a very firm sense of self,</p>
<p>or their sense of self is so rigid</p>
<p>that they can only operate in this like narrow trench</p>
<p>of one domain of life, and they end up very, very isolated.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d love for you to kind of share with us</p>
<p>what your recollections are,</p>
<p>kind of like the first time you realized kind of like,</p>
<p>yeah, like I&rsquo;m good in a bunch of different places.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m safe or I&rsquo;m whatever.</p>
<p>Because I think this also relates to confidence.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m glad you are giving me the benefit</p>
<p>of the doubt on going in the teams and being like,</p>
<p>oh, hey, man, it looks like guys are drinking</p>
<p>and I haven&rsquo;t really drank before.</p>
<p>And it seems like these guys are having a good time.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go have a good time with these guys.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of what I did, right?</p>
<p>As far as, and you know, I look at it now,</p>
<p>and unfortunately for me, you know,</p>
<p>I look at alcohol now as just, I&rsquo;ve seen so,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it destroy so many people</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve now kind of look at it and go, man,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think people should drink.</p>
<p>And look, I get it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of an example.</p>
<p>Like I used to drink and go out and have a good time.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t that big of a deal.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t negatively impact me in some dramatic way.</p>
<p>But I have so many friends that it is horrible for,</p>
<p>it is all but ruined their lives.</p>
<p>And you know, it&rsquo;s totally legal,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s totally legal, which is kind of bizarre.</p>
<p>So I think that figuring that out when I look back in it</p>
<p>and the culture in the SEAL teams was very,</p>
<p>there was very alcohol centric.</p>
<p>And part of that is because, you know,</p>
<p>that you got like, it&rsquo;s just like a fraternity</p>
<p>is alcohol centric or a football team is out</p>
<p>because you got a bunch of young dudes</p>
<p>that are gonna drink and have a good time.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just sort of a young dude kind of thing.</p>
<p>And unfortunately it ends up ruining a lot of people&rsquo;s lives</p>
<p>and they make bad decisions and they do stupid things</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just not good.</p>
<p>And I think the culture is moving away from that</p>
<p>a little bit in the SEAL teams.</p>
<p>You know, my alcohol brief used to say,</p>
<p>you know, I used to tell my guys,</p>
<p>if you go out, you get a DUI,</p>
<p>you get put in jail for a fight,</p>
<p>you get hurt because you&rsquo;re doing something drunk,</p>
<p>you just did Al-Qaeda&rsquo;s job for them.</p>
<p>You just did Al-Qaeda&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>They wanna take you off the battlefield</p>
<p>and you just took yourself off the battlefield.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t go on deployment now.</p>
<p>And that would always hit guys.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>the SEAL teams kind of leaning in that direction more,</p>
<p>realizing the negativity of alcohol.</p>
<p>I wish I would have realized that earlier.</p>
<p>I wish I would have been a better leader</p>
<p>and recognize that at an earlier stage</p>
<p>and recognize that just because</p>
<p>I was kind of getting away with it,</p>
<p>meaning it didn&rsquo;t really,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t wake up in the morning going,</p>
<p>man, I can&rsquo;t wait to get drunk.</p>
<p>I never really had that feeling.</p>
<p>I wish I would have realized</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s other guys that do.</p>
<p>And, you know, there&rsquo;s people that can operate</p>
<p>and be functional and it doesn&rsquo;t really impact their lives,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of people that don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s worth the dice roll</p>
<p>to start drinking.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s worth the dice roll.</p>
<p>What do you get out of it?</p>
<p>So I think that overall,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why if when I think about alcohol,</p>
<p>I just think about all the lives that it&rsquo;s ruined</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>And I wish I would have done a better job of saying,</p>
<p>you know what?</p>
<p>This is probably not good and we shouldn&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>And unfortunately I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I try and convey that message as much as I can now.</p>
<p>And it did bring me back to my roots</p>
<p>because when I was a kid,</p>
<p>it was like alcohol is weak.</p>
<p>And you look at these guys,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re acting like idiots.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna be like that.</p>
<p>And so, you know, as I got older,</p>
<p>once I got on the SEAL teams,</p>
<p>I kind of went back to that.</p>
<p>As far as kind of where I became me,</p>
<p>I just actually have to kind of give a lot of credit</p>
<p>to the music that I grew up listening to</p>
<p>and the attitude that we had back then,</p>
<p>listening to hardcore music,</p>
<p>being able to stand up against what other people were saying</p>
<p>which is what you&rsquo;re doing when you&rsquo;re in that scene.</p>
<p>And the whole DIY nature of it,</p>
<p>hey, we can just do this ourselves.</p>
<p>We can just make this happen for ourselves.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need anybody else.</p>
<p>We can do this.</p>
<p>And that hardcore attitude and sticking by your friends</p>
<p>and standing up and getting in fights</p>
<p>and like, that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re gonna do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of my attitude.</p>
<p>And I got interviewed for a documentary</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re making about Harley Flanagan</p>
<p>and the Cro-Mags.</p>
<p>And, you know, when I was a kid</p>
<p>and actually through my whole life,</p>
<p>like that music is the soundtrack to my life.</p>
<p>And so I always would have that music running in my head.</p>
<p>But to your question, I had something in me</p>
<p>that when I heard that music for the first time,</p>
<p>I was like, okay, here it is.</p>
<p>You know, here it is.</p>
<p>This is, you know, I hear the Beatles.</p>
<p>I hear the Grateful Dead.</p>
<p>I hear the Rolling Stones.</p>
<p>I hear the whoever.</p>
<p>And you go, okay, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But when I heard hardcore music for the first time,</p>
<p>when I heard the Cro-Mags, when I heard Agnostic Front,</p>
<p>when I heard the Bad Brains,</p>
<p>I thought that was just like, it was part of me already.</p>
<p>And then it was the attitude.</p>
<p>And again, you can listen to my podcast</p>
<p>with Harley Flanagan.</p>
<p>The way I viewed Harley Flanagan,</p>
<p>the way I viewed the Cro-Mags</p>
<p>was not the way they actually were.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, Harley was doing drugs.</p>
<p>I mean, horrible drugs.</p>
<p>He was on heroin, everything else.</p>
<p>But his image was like straight edge, kind of spiritual.</p>
<p>They had all that stuff going on.</p>
<p>And I thought, okay, well, that&rsquo;s who they are.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like a kid living in the woods in Connecticut.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kind of hearing what I&rsquo;m hearing.</p>
<p>Listen to the lyrics.</p>
<p>Listen to the lyrics of Minor Threat.</p>
<p>Listen to the lyrics.</p>
<p>And you go, okay, this stuff, I agree with this stuff.</p>
<p>And I just think that that kind of set a datum in my head</p>
<p>of being okay with being outside,</p>
<p>being okay with saying no,</p>
<p>being okay with being a rebel,</p>
<p>being okay with not going along</p>
<p>with what everyone else is doing.</p>
<p>And that became very important when I was in the military.</p>
<p>And I looked at what leadership might be telling me to do</p>
<p>and might think to myself,</p>
<p>hey, that doesn&rsquo;t seem like a good idea.</p>
<p>And having the wherewithal to say,</p>
<p>hey boss, I&rsquo;m not sure this is a good idea.</p>
<p>Not to be a jerk about it, but just to say,</p>
<p>there might be a better way to get this done.</p>
<p>What do you think of this?</p>
<p>Or, hey boss, can I ask you a question about that?</p>
<p>So I think if I had to trace it back,</p>
<p>having Black Flag, My War, Side 2 on my record player</p>
<p>for like a year and a half straight,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna leave a mark, man.</p>
<p>And I think it left a mark on me.</p>
<p>I love what you just said.</p>
<p>And when I say love, I really mean it</p>
<p>because as we both know, we share a common love</p>
<p>for certain music, in particular, Minor Threat</p>
<p>and some stuff from the punk rock scene.</p>
<p>In particular, for me, the Northeast punk rock scene,</p>
<p>the Bruisers, Al Bar from the Bruisers.</p>
<p>Now people know him as the lead singer</p>
<p>for the Dropkick Murphys, but before that was the Bruisers.</p>
<p>We run the risk of going deep down a rabbit hole</p>
<p>of music that most people may or may not be familiar with.</p>
<p>Although most people have heard of the Dropkicks,</p>
<p>but yeah, I&rsquo;m right there with you.</p>
<p>I mean, I remember the first time hearing</p>
<p>Stiff Little Fingers or Rancid</p>
<p>and even Bouncing Souls, right, from New Jersey.</p>
<p>Not even Bouncing Souls, sorry, Brian and Greg.</p>
<p>No, the Bouncing Souls and going, yes, that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s me, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>But as you said, it was already kind of in you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a recognition.</p>
<p>And I bring this up and I want to highlight it</p>
<p>not because we share this, although I do find that</p>
<p>to be an amazing kinship that we felt right away</p>
<p>and it was like we&rsquo;d probably riff</p>
<p>for 25 hours just on that.</p>
<p>But it brings me back to this idea</p>
<p>that certainly is not my idea.</p>
<p>Actually, the first time I heard about it</p>
<p>was from Robert Greene, who wrote the book Mastery</p>
<p>and some important writings, various, what was it?</p>
<p>I think it was the, I forget how many laws of power,</p>
<p>but those books, Robert Greene.</p>
<p>Mastery is actually a book that I highly recommend</p>
<p>people read because it talks about mentorship</p>
<p>and finding mentors and the fact that we&rsquo;re supposed</p>
<p>to break up and move on from mentors</p>
<p>and that mentors aren&rsquo;t always people that we know</p>
<p>or that know us, et cetera.</p>
<p>Amazing book, really.</p>
<p>But he was the first person I ever heard</p>
<p>describe this idea that if we think back long enough,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some seed moment, maybe it was shopping</p>
<p>for the pants, it sounds like it was,</p>
<p>but also music where you see something</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, yes, that&rsquo;s me and I&rsquo;m that.</p>
<p>And then that becomes a sort of soundtrack or visual image</p>
<p>or something for your life that you carry forward with you.</p>
<p>The neuroscientist in me wants to say</p>
<p>that that is the first time that we really tap</p>
<p>into this dopamine system in a way that is unique to us</p>
<p>because every child responds to food</p>
<p>with a little bit of dopamine when we&rsquo;re hungry,</p>
<p>responds to warmth when we&rsquo;re cold,</p>
<p>responds to a warm, dry diaper after we just wet ourselves,</p>
<p>which we all did.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, maybe Jocko, you changed your own diapers.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m guessing that someone changed your diaper</p>
<p>at one point, not an image path we need to go down.</p>
<p>But the idea is that we all have these universal sources</p>
<p>of kind of having our needs met,</p>
<p>going from discomfort to comfort and back again,</p>
<p>which is basically childhood.</p>
<p>But at some point, something comes along</p>
<p>that we really feel is unique to us.</p>
<p>And it may be the thing that everyone else likes.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s top 40 or whatever it is.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s the shoe that everyone&rsquo;s wearing</p>
<p>and that seems good.</p>
<p>But I do think that there are certain people</p>
<p>who are kind of 10 or 20 or maybe even 180 degrees off</p>
<p>from what everyone else likes.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, that thing is what&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a felt thing.</p>
<p>And so along the lines of felt things,</p>
<p>as opposed to things that everyone values,</p>
<p>what are your sources of motivation?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to guess that some of them are internal.</p>
<p>We could point to head or we could point to heart,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>But like when you think of sources of motivation,</p>
<p>do you have a palette of them that you can dip into?</p>
<p>Do you even feel the need to dip into them?</p>
<p>Or is it really just all about action steps</p>
<p>throughout your day?</p>
<p>Or if I can even venture into the somewhat harder stories</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve heard you talk about,</p>
<p>do you sometimes think back and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>listen, I&rsquo;m going to do this because there are a bunch</p>
<p>of guys that are dead now that can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m going to do it because I can.</p>
<p>What are the paints on your motivation palette, if you will?</p>
<p>Well, you probably heard me say that motivation</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t something that I am going to count on</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just an emotion that&rsquo;s going to come and go.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like feeling happy.</p>
<p>You feel happy right now.</p>
<p>Maybe you won&rsquo;t feel happy in 15 minutes.</p>
<p>You feel sad now.</p>
<p>Maybe you won&rsquo;t feel sad in 15 minutes.</p>
<p>You feel motivated right now.</p>
<p>You might not feel motivated in 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Therefore, I can&rsquo;t rely on it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not going to put any,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to put any money on just being motivated</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t really matter to me.</p>
<p>So the daily actions that I take aren&rsquo;t from motivation.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just from discipline.</p>
<p>Like I said earlier, I&rsquo;m not going to get up</p>
<p>and go through some big debate about,</p>
<p>well, do I really feel like doing this?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t feel like doing this, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just going to go do it.</p>
<p>Now, if we start to look at sort of a broader</p>
<p>movement through life and continuing to try</p>
<p>and move forward and move on,</p>
<p>my buddy Seth died and he was the Delta platoon commander</p>
<p>in tasking the bruiser.</p>
<p>And he died in 2017 and it was in a parachute accident.</p>
<p>And it was, I mean, it&rsquo;s definitely unexpected.</p>
<p>And also he&rsquo;d already been through multiple deployments,</p>
<p>was with us, with me in the Battle of Ramadi.</p>
<p>He then went back into Sadr City</p>
<p>and led a ton of very dangerous operations.</p>
<p>And then he did other deployments</p>
<p>and was kind of done with his deployments, kind of done.</p>
<p>And now he&rsquo;s just talking about when he&rsquo;s going to retire.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a couple of years away from retirement.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m talking about,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;re going to work together again.</p>
<p>And it all seems like we&rsquo;re on a pretty good path</p>
<p>to just move forward.</p>
<p>And then he ends up dying in a parachute accident.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a guy that was really just kind of,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to be able to replace any,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a uniqueness to him that you&rsquo;re not going to find.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve got some stuff that he wrote.</p>
<p>He was an incredible writer.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll like try and write something like him.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, we can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>Cause he had a bigger vocabulary</p>
<p>and a more articulate way of writing.</p>
<p>And so I can&rsquo;t write anything as well as he wrote it.</p>
<p>He was incredible at guitar.</p>
<p>He played guitar, played ukulele, like sick,</p>
<p>like an incredible at playing guitar.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a total knuckle dragger,</p>
<p>like a total meathead knuckle dragger.</p>
<p>You know, his nickname was unfrozen caveman</p>
<p>because he just, he just, you know,</p>
<p>looked like a big caveman and yet he spoke French</p>
<p>and, you know, could recite French poetry</p>
<p>and was really good at learning languages.</p>
<p>And he was an artist.</p>
<p>And he had, you know what synesthesia is?</p>
<p>Do you know what that is?</p>
<p>Emerging of the senses, so people that can see colors and.</p>
<p>So he didn&rsquo;t know what it was.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, see colors.</p>
<p>I hope most people can see colors.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, that can hear colors</p>
<p>and can associate particular colors with sound</p>
<p>or like particular keys on the piano.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty rare.</p>
<p>Some people think they have it,</p>
<p>but true synesthesics are pretty rare,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t have to fight for this trait.</p>
<p>It just kind of emerges for them.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t know it.</p>
<p>But one day he was talking to me</p>
<p>and he was embarrassed to tell me.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, you know, what&rsquo;s weird is,</p>
<p>when I think of numbers, I have colors in my head.</p>
<p>And I go, what do you mean?</p>
<p>And he says, hollow was zero.</p>
<p>And I remember seven is yellow.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember any of those,</p>
<p>but he just rattled off like one, two, three, four,</p>
<p>five, six, seven, eight, nine.</p>
<p>You know, he says, you know, hollow, white, clear,</p>
<p>all of, you know, just rattled off these colors.</p>
<p>So he had that synesthesia</p>
<p>and it gave him some kind of weird ability</p>
<p>to memorize numbers.</p>
<p>So, you know, he&rsquo;d be in a bar and talk to some girl</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;d say, what&rsquo;s your number?</p>
<p>And he would know it for two years.</p>
<p>He would just know it.</p>
<p>And that also made him incredibly good at playing guitar</p>
<p>because now like the scale and the fret board of a guitar</p>
<p>is this, it&rsquo;s a mathematical thing</p>
<p>that he has all in this weird,</p>
<p>this weird coloration scenario going on.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, so he&rsquo;s this guy and, you know,</p>
<p>and very, a very emotional guy,</p>
<p>a very emotional guy who would, you know,</p>
<p>I was talking earlier about being a balance for someone.</p>
<p>I had to balance this dude out on a daily basis sometimes,</p>
<p>you know, he&rsquo;d be so mad about something, you know,</p>
<p>one day he&rsquo;d be, I hate the teams.</p>
<p>I hate all these guys.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d say, yeah, I get it, man.</p>
<p>And the next day, I&rsquo;m never getting out of the teams.</p>
<p>You know, he would oscillate that bad.</p>
<p>And I would tell him, hey, bro, you&rsquo;re oscillating again.</p>
<p>And just would do anything.</p>
<p>And he loved his guys and would do anything for his guys.</p>
<p>And so when he died,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re at his, we&rsquo;re at his,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not his funeral, it&rsquo;s before the funeral.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the open casket thing, the wake thing.</p>
<p>And myself, his brother, Alex,</p>
<p>Leif Babin, who I wrote Extreme Ownership with,</p>
<p>and JP Donnell, who&rsquo;s one of my brothers</p>
<p>who works with us at Echelon Front now,</p>
<p>is with us in Ramadi and was very close to Seth.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re like, everyone kind of cleared out for us.</p>
<p>And we go in there and I think JP gave him,</p>
<p>JP had one of those memorial bracelets</p>
<p>with guys&rsquo; names on it that had died.</p>
<p>And JP gave that to him.</p>
<p>And I think Leif gave him some surf wax</p>
<p>because also Seth was a surfer.</p>
<p>And I gave Seth his black belt</p>
<p>because he started training jujitsu with me</p>
<p>and he had his purple belt.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d gotten his purple belt, I gave him his black belt.</p>
<p>And everyone was just quiet.</p>
<p>And, you know, JP was telling this story the other day.</p>
<p>And I just said, we will not fail him.</p>
<p>Meaning that him, Mark, Mikey, Chris, Seth,</p>
<p>and countless other guys, they&rsquo;re not here.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have the opportunity to do the things we do.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have the opportunity to get up in the morning.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what it is, man.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t fail those guys.</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think anyone listening to this</p>
<p>feels what I feel right now,</p>
<p>which is it&rsquo;s very clear that the depth of emotion</p>
<p>for people that we care about</p>
<p>and lose has everything to do with our love for them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just no question about it, right?</p>
<p>That grief and love are so intimately tied.</p>
<p>They are a direct reflection of one another.</p>
<p>And I hesitate to kind of stay on hard themes,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s really important for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>Last time we spoke, it was in your office and your podcast.</p>
<p>And after we wrapped up,</p>
<p>we started talking about some people we know</p>
<p>and some things that had happened in your community</p>
<p>and kind of spooled into some discussions</p>
<p>about things that happened in nearby communities</p>
<p>and civilian culture.</p>
<p>And one of the things that&rsquo;s so perplexing,</p>
<p>I think, to people, including me,</p>
<p>but maybe with time less so,</p>
<p>and this actually came up last night in a discussion</p>
<p>at home because of some recent events, not close to me,</p>
<p>but just that some people go through things</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s loss.</p>
<p>They go through life and there&rsquo;s hardship.</p>
<p>I think most people experience some hardship,</p>
<p>certainly some more than others.</p>
<p>And every once in a while and far too often,</p>
<p>and even in the SEAL Team community</p>
<p>and even in the various communities</p>
<p>within the SEAL Team community</p>
<p>where one would never expect it, right?</p>
<p>These are highly trained, tight community, hard guys, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the language we sometimes hear.</p>
<p>But as you pointed out,</p>
<p>these are people often that have tremendous emotional depth.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m so glad that you brought that up</p>
<p>because I think we sometimes think of emotion as weakness,</p>
<p>but there was a time not long ago, 40, 50 years ago,</p>
<p>where emotions like jealousy and intensity,</p>
<p>you think the character Sonny and the Godfather,</p>
<p>like he would get so pissed,</p>
<p>he would fight with his own fist, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty emotional response,</p>
<p>where intensity and emotion</p>
<p>were kind of interchangeable words, right?</p>
<p>At some level, I&rsquo;m going to be direct.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ve been a lot of guys coming out of the SEAL Teams</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been surprised to hear that kill themselves.</p>
<p>And yesterday there was a major suicide.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know this guy in particular,</p>
<p>we actually followed each other on social media,</p>
<p>but I admittedly was not close to him, didn&rsquo;t know him,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know him at all.</p>
<p>In fact, his name was Twitch or something.</p>
<p>I mean, he was this guy, he was a public facing figure.</p>
<p>But listen, happens all too often.</p>
<p>And it even happens in former operators.</p>
<p>And suicide is something that fascinates me</p>
<p>and intrigues me and scares the hell out of me.</p>
<p>Because for the life of me,</p>
<p>I cannot map it to any specific thing</p>
<p>in the brain or body that we&rsquo;re aware of.</p>
<p>And yet I&rsquo;ve had several friends commit suicide,</p>
<p>had my undergrad advisor commit suicide.</p>
<p>The point is not them or their story.</p>
<p>The point is what in the world dictates</p>
<p>whether or not somebody who has a community</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s doing well and then less well</p>
<p>decides to off themselves to end their own life</p>
<p>versus decide I&rsquo;m going to keep going.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m raising this as a question,</p>
<p>I wish I had an answer.</p>
<p>I used to have ideas like, oh, it&rsquo;s time perception.</p>
<p>These people are feeling so miserable</p>
<p>that they feel it&rsquo;s going to go on forever.</p>
<p>But then you start reading the literature on suicide</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve started to go into this.</p>
<p>For those of you that can stomach it,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know that I want to recommend this movie,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just going to say it exists.</p>
<p>The movie, The Bridge,</p>
<p>where they fixed the camera on the Golden Gate Bridge</p>
<p>for a year.</p>
<p>It turns out one person a day on average tries to jump off.</p>
<p>You talk to a guy who survived it.</p>
<p>By the way, he jumped off the moment he went off there.</p>
<p>He thought, I wish I hadn&rsquo;t done that.</p>
<p>He survived.</p>
<p>This kid with bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>especially males 20 to 30 times higher incidents of suicide.</p>
<p>Massive increase.</p>
<p>The point is that there&rsquo;s something that happens</p>
<p>in the brain where somehow people also will get the idea</p>
<p>and you hear this,</p>
<p>that this is like something they&rsquo;re excited to do</p>
<p>or that they&rsquo;re going to right the world somehow</p>
<p>by doing this,</p>
<p>or that somehow it&rsquo;s like a gift to themselves.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not encouraging anybody to do this.</p>
<p>I want to be very clear,</p>
<p>but these are the things that you hear.</p>
<p>And sadly your community has lost a number of people</p>
<p>through suicide.</p>
<p>And yet there are a lot of guys that thrive.</p>
<p>And so more as a template for trying to understand</p>
<p>mental health and depression and suicide,</p>
<p>what are your thoughts on why some people</p>
<p>seem to thrive and some people just go all the way down?</p>
<p>Clearly there&rsquo;s a, that&rsquo;s a very complex question.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s probably a lot of different answers.</p>
<p>And I certainly am not one to be able to answer</p>
<p>that question.</p>
<p>However, probably where my thought has gone on this lately,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve known some guys that have killed themselves</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been totally shocked,</p>
<p>but, and just been completely and totally shocked</p>
<p>that guys that I knew killed themselves.</p>
<p>Guys that you would think,</p>
<p>oh, this guy would never do this in a million years.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the feeling I&rsquo;ve had a lot about a lot of the</p>
<p>guys that I know that have killed themselves.</p>
<p>I had a woman on my podcast named Sarah Wilkinson,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s an awesome woman.</p>
<p>And she was married to a SEAL.</p>
<p>His name was Chad.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know him.</p>
<p>He killed himself.</p>
<p>He, and to hear her describe the story,</p>
<p>the shocking thing about the story is that the guy that she</p>
<p>knew, the guy that she married</p>
<p>was not the same guy that killed himself.</p>
<p>Something happened to him that made him a different person.</p>
<p>And look, they&rsquo;re getting all this information now</p>
<p>about CTE and the brain trauma that you go through.</p>
<p>And people are exposed to that.</p>
<p>And I think, if you&rsquo;ve ever seen George Foreman,</p>
<p>he seems totally normal and good to go, right?</p>
<p>And Muhammad Ali, not so much.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve known fighters and you can look at any number</p>
<p>of boxers that have had a career and some of them are fine.</p>
<p>And some of them have some real significant,</p>
<p>what is it?</p>
<p>Pugilistic, there&rsquo;s a pugilistic syndrome, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been punched too much and they have problems.</p>
<p>So different people, you can expose different people</p>
<p>to blast impact and it&rsquo;s gonna have a different impact</p>
<p>over time.</p>
<p>And I think that, again, to hear Sarah explain that story</p>
<p>and what she saw from her husband and how different he was</p>
<p>when they got married compared to where they ended up,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s totally different, a totally different person.</p>
<p>I had another friend of mine on who named Marcus Capone</p>
<p>and his wife came on with him and she said the same thing.</p>
<p>Like the guy that she married was not the same guy</p>
<p>that was ready to kill himself.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t, thankfully, it was a different person.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not, look, if Fred is married to some woman</p>
<p>and Fred and Jessica grow apart over time</p>
<p>and he ends up with some other girl,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still the same guy, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still the same guy that is now, look, they grew apart,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting divorced, we get it.</p>
<p>But the way that both of them described their husbands</p>
<p>as being different people,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what stuck with me more than anything else.</p>
<p>So I, again, I&rsquo;m throwing this out there</p>
<p>only because it&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve observed</p>
<p>through the people that I know</p>
<p>and seeing and hearing those stories</p>
<p>of people being totally different.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve known a few people.</p>
<p>One of my friends, Dave, killed himself.</p>
<p>I never would have guessed in a million years</p>
<p>that Dave would have killed himself.</p>
<p>It just, it doesn&rsquo;t compute, it doesn&rsquo;t compute.</p>
<p>And so my suspicion is there has to be something going on</p>
<p>mechanically or chemically with the brain</p>
<p>that causes them to get into a mode</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re depressed and they don&rsquo;t see a way out</p>
<p>and that that&rsquo;s the way they feel now.</p>
<p>And again, what&rsquo;s interesting about this</p>
<p>is we already talked about the fact that the selection,</p>
<p>the selection process weeds out guys</p>
<p>that are gonna take a loss</p>
<p>and not be able to get up again.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;ve got SEALs.</p>
<p>SEALs can take a loss and get back up again.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you learn how to do in bed</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s what you, you don&rsquo;t learn how to do it.</p>
<p>You have it.</p>
<p>And if you make it through that training,</p>
<p>you have that ability to take a loss.</p>
<p>All right, cool, shake it off, get back up, keep going.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna do that to you.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;ve got guys that are taking a loss</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t see a way out anymore.</p>
<p>In fact, to such a point</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re gonna take their own lives.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, my suspicion is at some point</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna figure out that this exposure</p>
<p>to the adrenaline, the explosions all the time.</p>
<p>I mean, you go out to a range, just in peace time,</p>
<p>you go out to a range and you shoot a Carl Gustav</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re a range safety officer.</p>
<p>So you go out there with every guy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s shooting a Carl Gustav.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big giant, like bazooka looking weapon.</p>
<p>And every time you shoot it,</p>
<p>it kind of rattles your cage a little bit.</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;re a range safety officer and you&rsquo;re out there</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna watch everyone in the platoon</p>
<p>shoot three of those, it&rsquo;s gonna have an impact.</p>
<p>Then you go overseas and you&rsquo;re a breacher</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re part of a breach team.</p>
<p>I mean, I had a time where one of my guys</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re doing an assault on a compound,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on the ladder, like most buildings in Iraq</p>
<p>have a wall around them.</p>
<p>So the way we would conduct these raids,</p>
<p>put the ladder up, the assault,</p>
<p>the breach team would climb over the ladder</p>
<p>and I would go right behind the breach team</p>
<p>and I would stand on the ladder.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m looking at the building, observing,</p>
<p>making sure there&rsquo;s no one waking up,</p>
<p>make sure there&rsquo;s no threats.</p>
<p>And then as I&rsquo;m watching this guy in particular,</p>
<p>he puts the breach on the door, explosive breach.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s gonna blow the door up.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got his little team with him.</p>
<p>He puts the breach on the door.</p>
<p>He starts to back away and there&rsquo;s like an obstacle.</p>
<p>There was like a freaking table or a lawn chair</p>
<p>or something and he couldn&rsquo;t get around it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sitting there, it&rsquo;s dark.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the middle of the night,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s two o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I wonder what he&rsquo;s gonna do.</p>
<p>I see him kind of stuck for a second.</p>
<p>And then I just see him lay down and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>oh, he&rsquo;s just gonna take this thing.</p>
<p>And sure enough, three or four feet away</p>
<p>from this breach point, he lays down</p>
<p>and just clacks off this explosive charge.</p>
<p>And I jump over the wall and as I&rsquo;m going in,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get the rest of the platoon</p>
<p>to go and commence this assault.</p>
<p>I look at him, he looked like he just got</p>
<p>hit in the head with a baseball bat.</p>
<p>And guess what he did the next night?</p>
<p>Another breach on another target.</p>
<p>Guess what he did the next night?</p>
<p>Another breach on another target.</p>
<p>So you get guys that have that exposure,</p>
<p>which is, I mean, every SEAL is eating a breach.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re eating flashbangs,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating breaches, you&rsquo;re shooting 50 cals.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re eating some traumatic brain injury.</p>
<p>But then you must have some people</p>
<p>that have some sort of genetic propensity</p>
<p>to have this negative thing happen.</p>
<p>And I can only guess, man,</p>
<p>that this has something to do with it.</p>
<p>Because otherwise, we wouldn&rsquo;t be hearing</p>
<p>so many of these stories.</p>
<p>And of course, we&rsquo;re just talking about the SEAL teams.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not talking about the military writ large,</p>
<p>which is in the same exact boat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also nervous about the social contagion of suicide</p>
<p>within the veteran community.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m nervous about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the things that makes me apprehensive</p>
<p>about talking about it.</p>
<p>But obviously I&rsquo;ve talked about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had people on my podcast to discuss these things.</p>
<p>But I am worried about that social contagion of,</p>
<p>man, you know, Fred did it.</p>
<p>You know, he got all this attention</p>
<p>and he doesn&rsquo;t have to deal with anything anymore.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do it too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gotta be some level of that going on as well.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a horrible situation.</p>
<p>Yeah, the social contagion part is one that hits home</p>
<p>from a different dimension.</p>
<p>The high school I went to, which is,</p>
<p>name isn&rsquo;t important, but Gunn High School,</p>
<p>G-U-N-N, Gunn High School,</p>
<p>is famous for being one of the better public high schools.</p>
<p>Not that I attended as much as I should have.</p>
<p>I can tell you more about the curbs in the parking lot</p>
<p>than I could tell you about the classes I took.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just not encouraging people</p>
<p>to not attend high school.</p>
<p>Please do.</p>
<p>It took a lot of really hard work to climb back up</p>
<p>to where I should have been when I graduate.</p>
<p>But it has an infamous reputation,</p>
<p>or I should say a reputation as an infamous school</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s one of the highest suicide rates</p>
<p>in any of the schools in the country</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a train tracks that run through town</p>
<p>and there was a kind of a contagion</p>
<p>of kids throwing themselves on the train tracks.</p>
<p>This was happening a lot.</p>
<p>This was written up in various newspapers, et cetera.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it seems to have died down.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m also hesitant to like talk about this</p>
<p>because no one wants to spark this,</p>
<p>but there does seem to be something about</p>
<p>lack of ability to see into a future, obviously,</p>
<p>or the future that people are seeing into is so dark</p>
<p>that somehow they lose touch with the idea</p>
<p>that emotions come and go.</p>
<p>You said it about emotion, about motivation.</p>
<p>Emotions come and go,</p>
<p>but somehow people lose touch with that.</p>
<p>And then I will venture a guess,</p>
<p>and here I&rsquo;m hoping someone&rsquo;s gonna figure this out</p>
<p>at some point so we can have a more concrete conversation</p>
<p>about the mechanisms and what to do about it.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s also something about identity,</p>
<p>about loss of a place to put one&rsquo;s energy,</p>
<p>something useful in the world.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a generator,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re talking about here are guys</p>
<p>that are generators, right?</p>
<p>They are not projectors.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re generators.</p>
<p>They live to have effective action on the world for good,</p>
<p>and then end up killing themselves.</p>
<p>In youth, it&rsquo;s a little more complicated</p>
<p>to put a finger on, you know,</p>
<p>because what&rsquo;s going on there.</p>
<p>We assume depression,</p>
<p>but then in learning more about suicide,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also this kind of like excitement</p>
<p>for certain people about solving something</p>
<p>that seemed unsolvable any other way.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m certainly not encouraging this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m strongly discouraging people</p>
<p>from taking their own life, obviously.</p>
<p>But something about time</p>
<p>and the loss of perception about time.</p>
<p>And one thing that we know for sure,</p>
<p>here we can really hang our hat on something,</p>
<p>is that if you do the forensics on somebody</p>
<p>that was suicidal, attempted, or took their life,</p>
<p>in the preceding days and weeks,</p>
<p>their sleep-wake schedule was completely whacked.</p>
<p>They exit the normal routine of most people.</p>
<p>They isolate through inversions of time.</p>
<p>And I do wonder sometimes whether or not</p>
<p>the vampire shifts, as they&rsquo;re sometimes called,</p>
<p>the nighttime deployments, and the back and forth.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a lot for a system to take.</p>
<p>Shift workers kill themselves</p>
<p>far more than non-shift workers.</p>
<p>So I do think there&rsquo;s something there.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m not saying everyone needs to be in bed by nine</p>
<p>and up by four, and you know,</p>
<p>although that would be a great schedule for most people.</p>
<p>But I do think that there are some universal laws</p>
<p>of what makes the human body and brain healthy.</p>
<p>And if you violate those laws long enough,</p>
<p>with CTE or with disruption in your schedules,</p>
<p>you run the risk,</p>
<p>especially if there&rsquo;s a predisposition there.</p>
<p>And then other factors start to layer in.</p>
<p>Again, and I have to apologize</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t have any real answers</p>
<p>or more biology or psychology to firmly throw at this,</p>
<p>except the warning for people who are bipolar</p>
<p>or know somebody with bipolar.</p>
<p>They are 20 to 30 times more likely to kill themselves.</p>
<p>And males in particular are more likely to use methods</p>
<p>that will kill them the first time, as opposed to survive.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a big sex difference there.</p>
<p>Yeah, you throw alcohol in there too, you know,</p>
<p>and Marcus has run an organization now</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re taking vets down to do the psychedelic,</p>
<p>what they call it, a journey.</p>
<p>This is Veterans Solutions.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re a great organization.</p>
<p>And I should mention very bipartisan organization.</p>
<p>I attended one event on Coronado</p>
<p>and there were people from the far left,</p>
<p>the far right politicians and everything in between</p>
<p>talking about how critical this is.</p>
<p>So this is not a political issue.</p>
<p>This is a mental health issue.</p>
<p>Yeah, and even when I reflected on Marcus talking to me,</p>
<p>he was talking about how he&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>in this downward spiral.</p>
<p>Part of the downward spiral, he&rsquo;s drinking every day.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m thinking to myself, man,</p>
<p>like I didn&rsquo;t think of it during the show.</p>
<p>I kind of was thinking about it afterwards.</p>
<p>I was thinking, man, like if you&rsquo;re drinking all the time,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on a downward spiral.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s one thing you should just stop.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s stop that immediately.</p>
<p>So I just wanted to throw that out there.</p>
<p>I think when that&rsquo;s another sign from the outside,</p>
<p>looking in, if someone&rsquo;s self-medicating with alcohol,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a good place, not a good place.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not in a good place</p>
<p>and they could probably use some help.</p>
<p>I appreciate you saying it.</p>
<p>Again, we did this episode on alcohol.</p>
<p>I went into it totally open-minded.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been a big drinker.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>I can drink or not drink.</p>
<p>Was never really into drugs at all.</p>
<p>You know, dabbled a little bit when I was younger.</p>
<p>I regret it, frankly.</p>
<p>Brain is plastic early on.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t need that.</p>
<p>Never did hard drugs,</p>
<p>never touched cocaine, amphetamine, or anything like that.</p>
<p>So, and if I had, I would say, right?</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m comfortable enough in my position in life</p>
<p>that if I had, I&rsquo;d certainly say.</p>
<p>But I think that it&rsquo;s pretty clear</p>
<p>that alcohol is bad for us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly past a certain, you know,</p>
<p>to drink, we limit people,</p>
<p>especially with the propensity for alcoholism</p>
<p>or who are dealing with other issues.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s especially the case for not drinking, right?</p>
<p>And I guess, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve gotten into some hard territory here,</p>
<p>but I think if this conversation</p>
<p>cues up an awareness to anybody, which I hope it would,</p>
<p>either people that are in that space</p>
<p>of wondering if they should continue or not,</p>
<p>or that know somebody who might be,</p>
<p>I do think that the takeaway is very clear,</p>
<p>which is that, you know,</p>
<p>there are ways to avoid these traps</p>
<p>and to avoid making these traps worse.</p>
<p>And I think we, regular sleep-wake schedules,</p>
<p>and I wrote this down,</p>
<p>that, you know, you, in particular,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said several times,</p>
<p>rather than looking for sources of things outside you,</p>
<p>like a job or a relationship, which are all great,</p>
<p>but as sources of energy or motivation or inspiration</p>
<p>to use positive action as a source of energy,</p>
<p>I think is just, if I could like put that up</p>
<p>on a billboard in Times Square, I would, right?</p>
<p>And I put your name next to it,</p>
<p>which is that positive action is a source of energy</p>
<p>that then you can recycle into more things.</p>
<p>I think going back to the fundamentals, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, and positive action is</p>
<p>when you have to contend with something,</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s something that you&rsquo;re afraid of, right?</p>
<p>Step into it, move towards it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re gonna solve that problem.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t solve problems by running away from them.</p>
<p>You solve them by moving towards them</p>
<p>and figuring out what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And I mean, alcohol is obviously a clear way</p>
<p>to avoid the problem, at least for the next four hours.</p>
<p>And you wake up and that problem is still there</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not good,</p>
<p>but when you&rsquo;ve got some kind of a problem and listen,</p>
<p>then we could go down the whole path</p>
<p>of talking about the indirect approach,</p>
<p>which is a theory of combat, which I completely believe in,</p>
<p>but it also applies to interacting with other people.</p>
<p>If you have a problem with some other person</p>
<p>to think to myself, well, I got a problem with Andrew,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go confront him on it.</p>
<p>And that might not be the best solution.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s probably not the best solution</p>
<p>for me to go confront you with the problem</p>
<p>because now we&rsquo;re gonna have a confrontation.</p>
<p>It might be better for me to take an indirect approach</p>
<p>and not confront you,</p>
<p>but instead engage in a conversation with you</p>
<p>about something that&rsquo;s maybe adjacent</p>
<p>to the problem that I have.</p>
<p>And then eventually that builds our relationship</p>
<p>to a point where you start to recognize,</p>
<p>oh, I bet Jocko feels something about this thing</p>
<p>and we can move towards a solution</p>
<p>instead of me trying to punch you in the face</p>
<p>with some truth that I believe</p>
<p>versus the truth that you believe.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re engaged in combat and that&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gonna be casualties.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather take an indirect approach</p>
<p>and build a relationship where we can solve problems</p>
<p>in a more positive way.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>And I love it because it really speaks to the power</p>
<p>of thinking carefully and being patient</p>
<p>and a little bit slower at times.</p>
<p>I also heard you say something earlier</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s still flagging in my mind,</p>
<p>which is not thinking too much.</p>
<p>I think it seems to be a time</p>
<p>where thinking too much is very dangerous.</p>
<p>And again, we can keep the discussion</p>
<p>that we were having about mental health</p>
<p>or we could even just call it what it is, mental illness.</p>
<p>I think everyone would agree suicide</p>
<p>is some reflection of an unhealthy state.</p>
<p>We can keep that in the backdrop as we talk about this,</p>
<p>but this isn&rsquo;t necessarily only about that.</p>
<p>You seem to have an ability to engage in things</p>
<p>without thinking too much</p>
<p>and yet also to sit back and be pretty observant.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve talked about third-personing of the self.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to talk a little bit more about this,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s a topic you&rsquo;ve delved into before.</p>
<p>And in particular, the topic of meditation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading more about meditation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve meditated for different stretches in my life,</p>
<p>different amounts of time.</p>
<p>And there are two basic forms of meditation</p>
<p>that I only recently learned about.</p>
<p>One is a focused attention meditation,</p>
<p>sitting, closing your eyes, focusing on your breath,</p>
<p>body, body surface,</p>
<p>or even a visual target in your environment and just focus.</p>
<p>And we know that that enhances one&rsquo;s ability to focus.</p>
<p>If you do it too late in the day,</p>
<p>it also enhance your ability to not fall asleep, right?</p>
<p>A lot of people don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>that meditation too late in the day,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a focused meditation,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just ramping up the activity</p>
<p>in the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great tool for getting better at focusing.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s also this type of meditation</p>
<p>called open observer meditation,</p>
<p>where you purposefully don&rsquo;t include a target in your mind</p>
<p>or in your vision or in your hearing.</p>
<p>And you just sit there, eyes closed, eyes open,</p>
<p>and you go into a place of whatever comes up,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t hover there too long.</p>
<p>The goal is to not hover on any one thing,</p>
<p>which sounds like deliberate attention deficit disorder,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually a pretty cool method, it turns out,</p>
<p>for restoring our ability to engage in focus,</p>
<p>but also for one particular thing</p>
<p>that you mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>which is creativity and creative problem solving,</p>
<p>which of course requires accessing,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say more colors on the palette</p>
<p>than your vision might be on,</p>
<p>realizing, oh, there&rsquo;s also all these other colors</p>
<p>over here in the periphery that I&rsquo;m missing</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m hyper-focused.</p>
<p>Do you meditate?</p>
<p>If you do meditate,</p>
<p>is it more of an open monitoring or a focused meditation?</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t do a kind of standard meditation,</p>
<p>are there times throughout your day</p>
<p>and your routine and your week where,</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m describing in this,</p>
<p>it maps to something that kind of feels like</p>
<p>open monitoring or focused meditation?</p>
<p>Yeah, so no, I don&rsquo;t meditate.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t ever, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>actually meditated for one second in my life, and I&hellip;</p>
<p>And I refuse to.</p>
<p>No, no, it&rsquo;s not that at all.</p>
<p>I know Sam Harris sent me his app,</p>
<p>and we were gonna do a podcast,</p>
<p>and I said, dude, I&rsquo;ll do it for two weeks,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll do a podcast,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll be more enlightened and everything,</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t even give Sam Harris two weeks,</p>
<p>so I still owe Sam Harris two weeks</p>
<p>on his app of meditation so we can see how it impacts me.</p>
<p>But no, I&rsquo;ve never done it before.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never tried to do it.</p>
<p>And that being said,</p>
<p>if the goal is to take a step back</p>
<p>and detach from what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>I do that all day, every day.</p>
<p>So that is something that I&rsquo;ve talked about,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s something that I tried to teach.</p>
<p>I tried to teach the young SEAL leaders</p>
<p>not to get caught up in what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>right in front of them,</p>
<p>but to take a step back,</p>
<p>detach from the situation,</p>
<p>detach from their emotions,</p>
<p>see more of what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>seeing more colors of the palette.</p>
<p>Well, on the battlefield,</p>
<p>I want people to be able to see more angles,</p>
<p>more maneuvers, more opportunities,</p>
<p>more of what the enemy might do,</p>
<p>more perspective.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I always tried to achieve.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m sorry, I apologize.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t give you any good discussion on meditation</p>
<p>because I haven&rsquo;t tried it.</p>
<p>No apology necessary,</p>
<p>but I will ask when you go surfing</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re sitting in the water waiting for a wave,</p>
<p>are you focused on one particular location on the horizon</p>
<p>or are you kind of in kind of a open monitoring,</p>
<p>just enjoying, just bouncing up and down in the water?</p>
<p>Like where is your attention during activities like that?</p>
<p>Yeah, so surfing, oftentimes surfing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a monkey mind</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just not thinking about anything.</p>
<p>Same thing with jujitsu.</p>
<p>Also with surfing, you know,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re waiting for a wave,</p>
<p>your mind is just going.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s in another universe sometimes</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re sitting there waiting</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re just looking out at the horizon</p>
<p>and your mind, I mean, my mind,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking about all kinds,</p>
<p>like I have to come home sometimes and like write notes</p>
<p>because I thought of this.</p>
<p>I thought of an idea.</p>
<p>I thought of a perspective.</p>
<p>That happens to me at jujitsu.</p>
<p>That happens to me talking to people</p>
<p>where someone&rsquo;s talking about something.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh, I got a good idea right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go write that down.</p>
<p>I have to go and write it down.</p>
<p>I have notes in my phone, you know,</p>
<p>like pages and pages and pages of notes in my phone</p>
<p>of ideas that I had and I write them down.</p>
<p>Do you voice memo things?</p>
<p>No, I type them.</p>
<p>I only need to type like seven words on,</p>
<p>and then I have the whole ideas in my head.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Yeah, I put a lot into the notes in my phone as well.</p>
<p>And it probably looks like gibberish to a lot of people,</p>
<p>but I go back through them when I&rsquo;m on the plane,</p>
<p>especially problems I was challenged with 10 years ago</p>
<p>or something.</p>
<p>And I look like, oh my, I&rsquo;m dealing with the same thing,</p>
<p>different situation, same me, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s that, we had a amazing psychiatrist on the show,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d love to hear a conversation between the two of you.</p>
<p>His name is Paul Conti.</p>
<p>He was trained at Stanford and Harvard.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an amazing guy.</p>
<p>Actually talks openly about the tragedy</p>
<p>that his brother killed himself,</p>
<p>which was what drove him into psychiatry.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s an interesting guy</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s obviously highly educated, incredibly smart.</p>
<p>Wrote a book on trauma,</p>
<p>but he has incredible knowledge</p>
<p>about a number of other areas of psychology,</p>
<p>including narcissism, sociopathy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s worked in a lot of really interesting domains</p>
<p>with interesting people</p>
<p>that everyone listening on this podcast would recognize.</p>
<p>Of course, he&rsquo;s not going to reveal who those people are,</p>
<p>but, and he talks about the fact that</p>
<p>you can look at different people, right?</p>
<p>He was actually the one that shared with me</p>
<p>this notion of generators and projectors</p>
<p>and directed me towards that literature.</p>
<p>But when he came on the podcast,</p>
<p>he talked a little bit about that stuff,</p>
<p>but he talked mostly about trauma.</p>
<p>But then we were talking about ways</p>
<p>in which people engage in the world and different archetypes</p>
<p>and how you start looking at stories throughout history</p>
<p>and you start seeing the same themes over and over, right?</p>
<p>Westerns, this idea of a guy rides into town</p>
<p>and does some repair work,</p>
<p>defeats the sinister person</p>
<p>or things that are imposing on the town,</p>
<p>then rides to the next town.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always like it ends with it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to keep continuing.</p>
<p>But then when we got into this discussion of relationship,</p>
<p>he talks about, he said this on the podcast,</p>
<p>of a patient who said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in 10 abusive relationships.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;d say to that patient,</p>
<p>no, you&rsquo;ve been in one relationship 10 times, right?</p>
<p>Which is essentially, it&rsquo;s all about your issue, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, I purposely didn&rsquo;t point at you</p>
<p>for those listening.</p>
<p>And I think that those features of ourselves</p>
<p>that we bring from condition to condition</p>
<p>can be negative or they can be positive.</p>
<p>One thing that&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>and here I&rsquo;m not trying to solve</p>
<p>or understand the SEAL team community per se,</p>
<p>but I think they represent an important archetype</p>
<p>because they are selected for this ability</p>
<p>to take hard conditions and failures</p>
<p>and turn them into wins.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the selection criteria, seems to be.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re finding who has that capability.</p>
<p>I see a lot of, and happen to know a few people</p>
<p>from the SEAL teams who get out and do really well.</p>
<p>You know, the great businesses,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a shining example of this.</p>
<p>And you have a family and you got German Shepherd too.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;ll talk about animals in a little bit.</p>
<p>You got a dog and it&rsquo;s like you surf and you train.</p>
<p>And like, I&rsquo;m sure you have your dark places,</p>
<p>dark moments and challenges like anybody else.</p>
<p>But things look to me like they&rsquo;re going pretty well.</p>
<p>And then I also know people from the SEAL teams.</p>
<p>Okay, they don&rsquo;t go down the path of suicide, fortunately,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s sort of like,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t do as well as I would have thought.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m certainly not picking on this community.</p>
<p>I also see this from people who are professional athletes.</p>
<p>I know kids that were phenomenal in high school.</p>
<p>I mean, these were like early admission</p>
<p>to all the Ivy League schools,</p>
<p>because that was what happened in the town</p>
<p>that I grew up in.</p>
<p>And I look at them now and I&rsquo;m like, wow, like gosh,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t, somehow it&rsquo;s not working out.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s important for people to hear that,</p>
<p>yes, winning creates the propensity for more winning.</p>
<p>But then why do you think it is that</p>
<p>in a community where people are trained to solve problems,</p>
<p>adapt and make things work,</p>
<p>some people flourish outside the military</p>
<p>and some flourish less.</p>
<p>And some we already talked about really,</p>
<p>go down the dark traps.</p>
<p>What do you think is the quality</p>
<p>that allows people to be really adaptable in particular?</p>
<p>Because most of us live in a landscape</p>
<p>where we have to deal with people who are not us,</p>
<p>like people that are not good at what we&rsquo;re good at.</p>
<p>And sometimes that&rsquo;s an asset, sometimes it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>You seem to be particularly good</p>
<p>at like understanding the human animal</p>
<p>and working with that.</p>
<p>So again, this is a broad question.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going very broadband here</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll get narrower again in a little bit,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d love your thoughts on like, why is it,</p>
<p>how is it, what determines whether or not</p>
<p>somebody thrives in novel environments?</p>
<p>I have to start off by just by saying</p>
<p>that I wrote a note as you were talking,</p>
<p>I just put SEAL and then I put the not equals sign,</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t say that a SEAL equals anything.</p>
<p>Excellent point.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s guys that have been in the SEAL teams</p>
<p>that are murderers, like there&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Like real life murderers.</p>
<p>Like murderers, like rapists and murderers</p>
<p>that went through SEAL training, rapist, murderers,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re in prison for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s a thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people that have been in the SEAL teams</p>
<p>that got kicked out of the SEAL teams for drugs.</p>
<p>And I mean, you name it and we&rsquo;ve got that,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve got guys that are just lazy</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve got guys that it just-</p>
<p>And physicians, you could say this about physicians.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ve been sociopathic serial killer physicians</p>
<p>and then there are ones that are in third world countries</p>
<p>right now that would not accept a billion dollars</p>
<p>to stop serving people at the level of the basic medicine</p>
<p>that they deserve.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s the SEALs that get out</p>
<p>and just volunteer to go help</p>
<p>in the worst places in the world.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got a full spectrum of people.</p>
<p>So to say a SEAL equals success in any domain,</p>
<p>the only domain you can say that they&rsquo;re successful</p>
<p>is they made it through basic SEAL training.</p>
<p>Because guys make it through basic SEAL training</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not good SEALs, right?</p>
<p>That happens, you know?</p>
<p>So you get guys that make it through basic SEAL training</p>
<p>and they make it through SEAL qualification training</p>
<p>and they make it to a SEAL team</p>
<p>and they get kicked out of the SEAL teams</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not good SEALs.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t meant to do that job.</p>
<p>That happens.</p>
<p>So all they&rsquo;ve proven by making it</p>
<p>through basic SEAL training</p>
<p>is they can kind of suck it up for a while.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also guys that make it through</p>
<p>basic SEAL training because they learned</p>
<p>how to maneuver through the system.</p>
<p>They learned what to do</p>
<p>and what the minimum requirements were</p>
<p>and how they could skate through this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s guys like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a huge number, but they&rsquo;re absolutely there.</p>
<p>We see them in science.</p>
<p>You know, people that go to a lab,</p>
<p>figure out who the director of the lab</p>
<p>is at the level of psychology.</p>
<p>And this is actually one of the more</p>
<p>dangerous aspects of science.</p>
<p>It actually negatively impacts all of society.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just say it.</p>
<p>And any scientists will know what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>They find the big famous labs.</p>
<p>They figure out who that leader of the lab is</p>
<p>and they get that person the data they want.</p>
<p>They might not make the data up,</p>
<p>but they will certainly discard the data that don&rsquo;t fit.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>That which is one way of making data up by exclusion, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not literally like painting pictures of cells</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t there or something,</p>
<p>but that happens a lot.</p>
<p>And those people often go far.</p>
<p>They rarely go all the way</p>
<p>because pretty soon their reputation, you know,</p>
<p>expands to the point where people go like,</p>
<p>yeah, no one can repeat that result like that.</p>
<p>But these people sit in very high positions,</p>
<p>not at Stanford, right?</p>
<p>I will say, I don&rsquo;t know any of my colleagues at Stanford</p>
<p>that meet those criteria,</p>
<p>but you see them and you see what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re basically solving a social engineering thing.</p>
<p>They just happen to be doing it in science.</p>
<p>Now, why anyone would do that in science, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t get rich in science.</p>
<p>You certainly don&rsquo;t get famous,</p>
<p>but for whatever reason,</p>
<p>they figured it out that that&rsquo;s where they&rsquo;re going to do it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure you see it in law firms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you see it in every single domain of life.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Now you pointed out that there&rsquo;s some people</p>
<p>that make it to the Ivy League schools</p>
<p>and they graduate from an Ivy League school</p>
<p>and then they don&rsquo;t do well.</p>
<p>And to me, that&rsquo;s a very similar to someone</p>
<p>that might make it to the SEAL teams,</p>
<p>do well in the SEAL teams,</p>
<p>and then they get out and they don&rsquo;t do well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably because of what I talked about earlier</p>
<p>when I went to Navy bootcamp.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you got to do.</p>
<p>If you do it well, you&rsquo;ll be rewarded.</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;re in high school and your dad,</p>
<p>your mom and dad say,</p>
<p>hey, if you do good in high school,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get into this Ivy League school</p>
<p>and you get into that Ivy League school.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what you need to do in high school.</p>
<p>You need to get good grades.</p>
<p>You need to be part of the glee club.</p>
<p>You need to, whatever the things are that you got to do,</p>
<p>you got to speak a different language.</p>
<p>You got to go volunteer in Guatemala in the summertime.</p>
<p>You got to do these things</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ll get into the good college.</p>
<p>Once you get in the good college,</p>
<p>you got to get this degree.</p>
<p>Once you get that degree.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve had a path laid out for them of boxes to check</p>
<p>and they go and check the boxes.</p>
<p>And then when they get done,</p>
<p>no one has put any more boxes out in front of them</p>
<p>so they don&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>And that can certainly happen from someone in the SEAL teams</p>
<p>or someone in the military that what they&rsquo;ve been,</p>
<p>hey, this is your mission.</p>
<p>This is what you got to do.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you need to do to do it well.</p>
<p>Check the box, check the box, check the box, check the box.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s time to retire.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no one putting a box in front of them to check.</p>
<p>And so unless someone,</p>
<p>some guys get out of the SEAL teams</p>
<p>and they go into a big corporate structure</p>
<p>and they kick ass</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s someone in the corporate world saying,</p>
<p>hey, here&rsquo;s what you got to do next year.</p>
<p>And they do great.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s super good for them.</p>
<p>And they actually really like it.</p>
<p>I was talking to a guy the other day.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like a full-on in a corporation.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s doing a great job.</p>
<p>He likes what he&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>So, but I think you get some guys</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t really have the open mind</p>
<p>to see where opportunities are.</p>
<p>And they, you know,</p>
<p>one thing that&rsquo;s nice about the SEAL teams is it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of,</p>
<p>you get a lot of freedom of maneuver, right?</p>
<p>You can really do a lot of stuff that you kind of want to do.</p>
<p>And so when they look at the corporate world,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t see that.</p>
<p>And they think, I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m not going to do that.</p>
<p>But then they&rsquo;re not quite sure how to take the next step.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s why you might see some guys</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t super successful</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t really know what to do.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t really have a mind</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s open to look for opportunities.</p>
<p>And also you got some guys that success for them</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re going to hang out with their family</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to, you know, get in good shape.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re going to run some triathlons or competing,</p>
<p>whatever they&rsquo;re going to do, they&rsquo;re going to go do it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re looking to do, you know,</p>
<p>which is also awesome.</p>
<p>Go take time, go enjoy your family, man.</p>
<p>You gave enough to your country.</p>
<p>Go hang out with your kids.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s success as far as I&rsquo;m concerned too.</p>
<p>I agree there.</p>
<p>I know far too many people who are successful</p>
<p>in their professional lives,</p>
<p>but who have very diminished personal lives</p>
<p>and it is not a pretty picture.</p>
<p>You know, you mentioned the parent kind of driving the kid,</p>
<p>do this, do that.</p>
<p>In that scenario, I sense tones of fear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about not being a failure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not actually about love of your craft</p>
<p>or what you enjoy.</p>
<p>Pretty early in my science career,</p>
<p>I learned that there are certain people</p>
<p>who are just ambitious.</p>
<p>They just like to win.</p>
<p>And I used to joke around, it&rsquo;s not polite,</p>
<p>but I used to go, you know,</p>
<p>we should all just tell that person</p>
<p>that like the new cool thing is like</p>
<p>trying to understand the biology of like,</p>
<p>and I would say like feces or something,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d probably work on it.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;d be like, yeah, it&rsquo;s like the greatest thing</p>
<p>because they actually don&rsquo;t care what they&rsquo;re working on.</p>
<p>For them, it&rsquo;s just the hunt.</p>
<p>And I learned that actually people like that</p>
<p>can serve an important role because like,</p>
<p>well, there&rsquo;s actually a whole microbiome.</p>
<p>There are actually labs that do work on feces.</p>
<p>So forgive me, my colleagues that work on microbiomes,</p>
<p>but in all seriousness, you know,</p>
<p>people who are just ambitious can be very effective</p>
<p>because you put a problem in front of them</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like a dog they&rsquo;ll just retrieve.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, they&rsquo;ll just go</p>
<p>as opposed to love of retrieving.</p>
<p>For retrieving sake, it&rsquo;s like you give that same dog,</p>
<p>the analogy here would be give that same dog a high jump</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like into high jumping, right?</p>
<p>Or whatever it is, or diving underwater.</p>
<p>But I think of people more like animals</p>
<p>and more like different dog species.</p>
<p>As your case was with music,</p>
<p>particular music and communities,</p>
<p>or the example of shopping for the pants</p>
<p>and that experience of like the first time</p>
<p>you tap into something that really feels</p>
<p>kind of unique to you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, there&rsquo;s something here.</p>
<p>To be able to find work that includes that,</p>
<p>but also is hard and also allows you to evolve over time.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that&rsquo;s the real gift</p>
<p>that I think most people are seeking.</p>
<p>And of course there&rsquo;s no shortcut to that</p>
<p>except perhaps one, which is to be able to sense</p>
<p>the difference between ambition</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no better word for it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just call it what it is, which is love.</p>
<p>Like I love this.</p>
<p>And the reason I think that love is so powerful</p>
<p>and here I&rsquo;m sounding like Lex Friedman,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t mean interrelational love.</p>
<p>I mean like sort of that being able to sense</p>
<p>what that feels like is that I do believe</p>
<p>that it allows us to tap into an enormous number</p>
<p>of things that fear alone and ambition alone</p>
<p>and just being a hard driving person alone</p>
<p>will not allow us to tap into.</p>
<p>Things like adaptiveness, creativity.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a really obvious reason for it,</p>
<p>which is that the one thing we know about our species</p>
<p>is that we want to make more of ourselves</p>
<p>and to take good care of our young.</p>
<p>Whether or not everyone has kids or not is irrelevant.</p>
<p>The point is that every species not only wants to do that,</p>
<p>but need to do that.</p>
<p>And the feeling of love is really what allows us</p>
<p>to be adaptable.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything that trains up adaptability</p>
<p>as much as being around kids.</p>
<p>You just have to be adaptable, right?</p>
<p>Because one moment they&rsquo;re up, then they&rsquo;re down,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re disappointed.</p>
<p>So, you know, and you shared a really important story</p>
<p>about loss of somebody that clearly you loved</p>
<p>and that clearly loved the community he worked in.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just that you guys loved him,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that he loved you guys.</p>
<p>And I think that being able to tap into these feelings</p>
<p>of love for things, for people and for experiences,</p>
<p>I think is so critical.</p>
<p>And, you know, I don&rsquo;t meditate much these days,</p>
<p>but I have heard of this like love and kindness meditation</p>
<p>and I would sound so soft to me.</p>
<p>I was thinking like, gosh, what am I supposed to do?</p>
<p>Then float, like levitate at the end</p>
<p>and like wear a, you know, a moo moo or whatever it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>But I, my friend who I&rsquo;m fortunate to call a friend,</p>
<p>not trying to name drop here,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m very fortunate to call Rick Rubin,</p>
<p>a music producer, a friend.</p>
<p>And he was the one who started turning me on</p>
<p>to different forms of meditation.</p>
<p>The ones I mentioned before in this idea</p>
<p>that there are forms of meditation,</p>
<p>which put us in touch with what he calls the source.</p>
<p>Now this is really getting a little mystical,</p>
<p>but I think this all maps back to the same thing,</p>
<p>which is that there are sources of dopamine</p>
<p>and the other neurotransmitters in us</p>
<p>that give us kind of a superpower to adapt to anything.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s at least includes love</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the most adaptable emotion by definition,</p>
<p>because of what&rsquo;s required for evolution.</p>
<p>So the question therefore is in yourself</p>
<p>and in your observation of people that you&rsquo;ve worked with,</p>
<p>did you ever sense that just being hard driving</p>
<p>was kind of, it was great, but it was limiting.</p>
<p>Like, did you ever sense that like</p>
<p>by liking the people you work with,</p>
<p>you could perform much better?</p>
<p>Even if they perhaps were not as hard</p>
<p>to kind of borrow the common parlance around this,</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t as hard as everybody else,</p>
<p>that because you like each other so, so much</p>
<p>that you can kind of do anything.</p>
<p>Well, if you have a team of 10 people</p>
<p>and you all have a great relationship and you get along well</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going against my team and we all hate each other</p>
<p>and who&rsquo;s going to win?</p>
<p>The team that loves each other is going to win, I would hope.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even close.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, if you work for me</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t like me,</p>
<p>what kind of performance are you going to give me?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be tough.</p>
<p>What if you love me and I&rsquo;ve looked out for you</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve done everything for you and I&rsquo;ve taken care of you,</p>
<p>what kind of performance are you going to give me?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like a dog, I&rsquo;d die for you.</p>
<p>So yeah, and you know, earlier you asked about</p>
<p>the human animal and human nature.</p>
<p>And this is part of leadership.</p>
<p>I got asked this question the other day by a,</p>
<p>I was working with a company and the guy says, you know,</p>
<p>how do I identify,</p>
<p>what are the characteristics of someone that can execute</p>
<p>and how do I identify those characteristics in a person</p>
<p>so that I can get those people?</p>
<p>And I said, well, first of all,</p>
<p>the characteristics are the characteristics</p>
<p>that everybody&rsquo;s, you know, obviously someone that&rsquo;s driven,</p>
<p>someone that can communicate well,</p>
<p>someone that&rsquo;s going to make things happen.</p>
<p>Those are pretty simple to know.</p>
<p>We know what they are.</p>
<p>How do you identify them?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty simple as well.</p>
<p>I give you a task.</p>
<p>I give Andrew a task.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty simple task.</p>
<p>If you get it done, cool.</p>
<p>Give you a little bit more complex task.</p>
<p>Do you get it done?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I give the same task to Fred.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t get it done.</p>
<p>He comes back with a bunch of questions.</p>
<p>He slow rolls it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got all kinds of excuses and problems.</p>
<p>I give you an even more complex task.</p>
<p>You come back, you get it done.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m going to realize, okay,</p>
<p>Andrew&rsquo;s the guy that makes things happen.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a guy that can actually execute.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a little bit what you said.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s certain breeds of dogs,</p>
<p>but even that is,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not as different as human beings are, right?</p>
<p>And there are some, so now there are some guys,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got Andrew who will make things happen.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the problem with Andrew.</p>
<p>When I say, hey, Andrew,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s this nebulous idea that I have.</p>
<p>Can you turn this into a reality?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, where do I start?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure where you want me to go.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I gave it to the guy</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t make anything happen</p>
<p>with specific tasks that I gave him.</p>
<p>And he comes back and says,</p>
<p>I say, hey, I got this nebulous idea.</p>
<p>Can you see what you, he goes, oh yeah.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden he takes it and he says,</p>
<p>hey, I figured out a way to make this happen.</p>
<p>So you might have someone that&rsquo;s very good at executing,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not very creative.</p>
<p>I might have somebody that&rsquo;s very creative,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not very good at executing.</p>
<p>So what do I do?</p>
<p>I build a team where I&rsquo;ve got Andrew and Fred</p>
<p>and they work together.</p>
<p>And Fred comes up with good ideas</p>
<p>and we bring them to Andrew and Andrew goes and executes him.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing from a leadership perspective</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re letting people&rsquo;s nature execute</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re putting people into roles</p>
<p>where their nature is beneficial.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna take someone that&rsquo;s shy and introverted</p>
<p>and put them out in the lead sales role.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna take somebody that&rsquo;s boisterous</p>
<p>and extroverted and put them into a cubicle</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re gonna be looking at spreadsheets all day.</p>
<p>Clearly, I&rsquo;m not gonna do that.</p>
<p>So what we have to do as leaders</p>
<p>is we have to find the right people for the right role</p>
<p>and we place them into those roles.</p>
<p>Now, does it mean that I abandon all hope</p>
<p>that the guy that&rsquo;s an introvert</p>
<p>will ever develop more communication skills?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m still gonna work with him.</p>
<p>And over time, we&rsquo;ll get him a little bit moving</p>
<p>in the right direction,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not gonna take somebody that&rsquo;s a total introvert</p>
<p>and turn them into a lead sales guy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not going to happen any more</p>
<p>than I&rsquo;m gonna change a tiger stripes.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we have to do</p>
<p>is we have to help people.</p>
<p>As leaders, we have to help people find the role</p>
<p>and find the thing that they&rsquo;re good at.</p>
<p>Now, does that mean if I have someone that loves their job,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna do better at it?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Does it mean that if I have somebody that&rsquo;s driven</p>
<p>just by achievement,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re gonna be good at their job?</p>
<p>No, in fact, well, they can be.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gonna be certain roles I can put them in, right?</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;ve got a sales number I need to hit</p>
<p>and Andrew&rsquo;s super into achievement,</p>
<p>he wants to be the golden child</p>
<p>and wants to have his picture on the magazine</p>
<p>that we put out about our industry,</p>
<p>cool, I can throw this task at you</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna go and get it.</p>
<p>The problem is if there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna take more perseverance</p>
<p>and the reward isn&rsquo;t that high,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s a long-term goal,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably not the right guy for the job.</p>
<p>So liking your job is absolutely critical.</p>
<p>And if you love your job,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be able to most likely excel at it.</p>
<p>Now, you could be an unfortunate person</p>
<p>that loves your job and is not good at it.</p>
<p>That happens occasionally, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like, sure it does, but it seems pretty rare.</p>
<p>It reminds me of your skateboarding career.</p>
<p>You loved skateboarding, but you just weren&rsquo;t that good at it.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t that good at it.</p>
<p>But you know what I loved more than skateboarding?</p>
<p>I loved the community I was in.</p>
<p>I loved the community I was in.</p>
<p>And I probably would have gone to the industry side</p>
<p>or worked on a company side</p>
<p>and not been on the actual skateboard side</p>
<p>or just skateboard for fun.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a guy in the skateboard community,</p>
<p>his name&rsquo;s Jim Thiebaud,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s kind of the not so hidden secret in that community.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an amazing guy.</p>
<p>And he sort of early on left professional skateboarding</p>
<p>to run a company, Real Deluxe,</p>
<p>a bunch of other companies.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an amazing guy.</p>
<p>And he told me, we&rsquo;d become friends recently,</p>
<p>and he said he realized he wasn&rsquo;t gonna be</p>
<p>one of the big guys,</p>
<p>but he knew he wanted to be in this community.</p>
<p>And so he found his place.</p>
<p>And I think everyone in skateboarding looks to Jim</p>
<p>as like the guy who cares,</p>
<p>he truly cares about the sport and about the people.</p>
<p>And so he learned to kind of just wrap his arms</p>
<p>and his heart around the whole thing, and it just works.</p>
<p>And so I do think everyone has a certain place</p>
<p>in a community or in a team.</p>
<p>I think that as you&rsquo;re describing this,</p>
<p>I have to imagine that people are listening and thinking,</p>
<p>like, wow, this team thing is awesome.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s just amazing.</p>
<p>I wish I had that, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fortunate to have that in my podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had that in my lab, certainly in my podcast team.</p>
<p>I always say, these guys go, I go.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s not just people that press buttons</p>
<p>and run equipment, take photos.</p>
<p>Like, they go, I go.</p>
<p>Like, they go, it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m fine with that.</p>
<p>I actually love that because it&rsquo;s, yes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about the podcast and about the information</p>
<p>and getting it out there,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s as much about the team and working together</p>
<p>just like it was with skateboarding.</p>
<p>So hopefully I&rsquo;m better at podcasting</p>
<p>than I was at skateboarding.</p>
<p>I end up getting broke off, as the skateboarders say,</p>
<p>and skateboarding too often.</p>
<p>But I want to ask, like, in your family life,</p>
<p>do you look at that as a team?</p>
<p>Like, do you think like, this is my team</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re different and how can we synergize?</p>
<p>Yeah, and you&rsquo;ve got to look at every team like that.</p>
<p>What are the strengths and weaknesses of the team</p>
<p>and who&rsquo;s going to be good at what?</p>
<p>And how do you put people in positions</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re going to be able to excel?</p>
<p>I mean, what&rsquo;s his name, Thibaut?</p>
<p>Jim Thibaut.</p>
<p>Jim Thibaut.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Imagine if he had a mentor that was only saying,</p>
<p>listen, you got to be a pro skater.</p>
<p>This is your only opportunity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing else.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t have the ability to take a step back</p>
<p>and say, you know what, man?</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m not that, I&rsquo;m not going to be good enough,</p>
<p>but I really love this industry.</p>
<p>So luckily for him, he figured that out.</p>
<p>And you know, you talked about the superpower</p>
<p>of being like loving your job.</p>
<p>The one thing I claim to be a superpower</p>
<p>is the ability to take a step back and detach,</p>
<p>which I guess is going back to your meditation thing.</p>
<p>But being able to take a step back and look at your life</p>
<p>and say, man, I&rsquo;ve been skateboarding longer than that guy</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s better than me.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been skateboarding longer than that other guy</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s better than me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably not going to be,</p>
<p>this is probably not the right job for me.</p>
<p>What could I do where I could use my skillset?</p>
<p>And obviously he had some entrepreneurial spirit</p>
<p>and was able to figure that out.</p>
<p>So being able to be a part of a team,</p>
<p>and it goes to what I was saying earlier about the mob,</p>
<p>being able to be part of a team,</p>
<p>part of the mob, part of the gang,</p>
<p>but still have the ability to take a step back,</p>
<p>detach from that and assess what is the best way</p>
<p>for this team to move forward.</p>
<p>I mean, you could have this brilliant idea</p>
<p>that from now on, you&rsquo;re going to make all of your podcasts</p>
<p>about the molecular structure of whatever.</p>
<p>And you know, the rest of the team</p>
<p>probably need to pull you aside and say,</p>
<p>hey man, like I know you really care about that</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>But everyone really wants to hear about this other stuff.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s tie it in together.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s expand what you,</p>
<p>the specific thing you want to talk about.</p>
<p>So being able to take a step back,</p>
<p>detach and see the bigger picture,</p>
<p>to me is the true superpower of life, of life.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a lot harder than it sounds.</p>
<p>And you know, this goes back to</p>
<p>when you start talking about people that are having,</p>
<p>going through struggles in life, right?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve described this before as,</p>
<p>you know, if I&rsquo;m looking at you</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in a bad state, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re depressed, you&rsquo;re sad, you&rsquo;re moping around,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not getting anything done.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m looking at you from the outside</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m thinking for me,</p>
<p>I see this storm cloud around your head, right?</p>
<p>I see the storm cloud around your head and you&rsquo;re in there.</p>
<p>And all you see,</p>
<p>no matter what direction you look is storm.</p>
<p>All you see is darkness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m outside and I&rsquo;m looking and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>hey man, this guy&rsquo;s got a great education.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s healthy, he&rsquo;s got a good team around him.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s got all these things going for him.</p>
<p>But you in that state,</p>
<p>you literally cannot see anything</p>
<p>but the darkness of the storm.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so scary</p>
<p>about when people enter that mode,</p>
<p>is you can look,</p>
<p>I can look at it from the outside and be like,</p>
<p>Andrew, you just got to move like four feet forward</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to be through this thing.</p>
<p>You might hear me say that and you go,</p>
<p>no, Jocko, I&rsquo;m looking ahead.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing but darkness.</p>
<p>So helping people move forward,</p>
<p>take action and be able to get that perspective,</p>
<p>detach and get outside themselves,</p>
<p>get outside their own heads.</p>
<p>You know, Tim Ferriss said,</p>
<p>get out of your head, get into your body.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one way to do it.</p>
<p>Take action, go do things.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very scary.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve had this experience</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re talking to someone that you know</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re bogged down in whatever problem it is,</p>
<p>whatever stress they&rsquo;re under.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re looking at them going,</p>
<p>hey man, it&rsquo;s going to be okay.</p>
<p>Like you can clearly see that whatever they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>whatever is bothering them and dragging them.</p>
<p>Now you can clearly see,</p>
<p>you know, a lot of times it&rsquo;s a relationship, right?</p>
<p>The girl, the guy, they got dumped.</p>
<p>And you go, hey man, that person was a disaster anyways.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re better off without them.</p>
<p>And they cannot compute that.</p>
<p>They are stuck there.</p>
<p>Or maybe it&rsquo;s the school that they didn&rsquo;t get into</p>
<p>or the job that they didn&rsquo;t get.</p>
<p>And they get so wrapped up in that,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t get out of that storm.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so, it&rsquo;s such a helpless feeling</p>
<p>to sit there and tell someone,</p>
<p>hey, you just move a little bit towards me</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to get out of this storm.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so much easier said than done.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why trying to engage with people</p>
<p>and trying to give people that superpower of detachment</p>
<p>where they can take a step back and say, you know what?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, man.</p>
<p>That girl, she wasn&rsquo;t who I really thought she was.</p>
<p>I should move on.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But easier said than done.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the biggest challenges I think</p>
<p>that we have as friends and in parents and teammates</p>
<p>is helping people learn to detach,</p>
<p>learn to see the bigger picture,</p>
<p>learn to see that the problem that you have,</p>
<p>that your whole world is actually not that big of a deal.</p>
<p>You know what I wrote?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written a bunch of kids&rsquo; books.</p>
<p>And one of the things that triggered me to write kids&rsquo; books</p>
<p>is realizing that, you know, one day my daughter came home.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my oldest daughter.</p>
<p>And she came home from school and she&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>she says, I&rsquo;m stupid.</p>
<p>What do you mean you&rsquo;re stupid?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stupid, I&rsquo;m dumb.</p>
<p>Why do you think that?</p>
<p>No, whatever grade it is</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re supposed to know your times tables.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know my times tables.</p>
<p>I said, oh, well, how much have you studied?</p>
<p>She kind of gave me the confused look.</p>
<p>What do you mean studied?</p>
<p>I said, have you studied yet?</p>
<p>Have you made flashcards to learn them?</p>
<p>And she didn&rsquo;t, she hadn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>She thought she should just know them</p>
<p>from, you know, the teacher went over what they are.</p>
<p>Now she should know them</p>
<p>like some other kids in the class did.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m sitting there going, oh yeah, cool.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll just, you know, we&rsquo;ll make some flashcards.</p>
<p>And she made flashcards</p>
<p>and she learned her times tables in 45 minutes</p>
<p>and we were good.</p>
<p>But what struck me was, to me, I was like, oh, no big deal.</p>
<p>To her, it was her whole life.</p>
<p>And then I got to see that with my other kids.</p>
<p>You know, somebody said something to them in the recess yard</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, oh, screw that kid.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re, don&rsquo;t worry about them.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re, that&rsquo;s their whole world.</p>
<p>And that unfortunately doesn&rsquo;t only apply to kids.</p>
<p>It applies to adults as well.</p>
<p>And they get this problem in their world</p>
<p>that seems so insurmountable and so massive</p>
<p>because that little ecosystem that they&rsquo;re stuck in</p>
<p>is their world.</p>
<p>And they run into this problem in that</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s disruptive in that world</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t know how to get out of it.</p>
<p>You know, I did a podcast talking about these ecosystems</p>
<p>that people get into, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s all these ecosystems.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in an ecosystem.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re both in a shared ecosystem of podcasting.</p>
<p>And we could be like, oh my gosh, you know,</p>
<p>Lex just came out with a new podcast</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been the biggest success.</p>
<p>And what can I do to catch up with Lex?</p>
<p>And all of a sudden I could get really by,</p>
<p>you could get really by, we could be bothered by that</p>
<p>and think, man, I&rsquo;m a failure.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there&rsquo;s people that don&rsquo;t listen to podcasts.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people that don&rsquo;t even know what a podcast is.</p>
<p>And yet it&rsquo;s our whole world.</p>
<p>If we let it be, you&rsquo;re in the academic world.</p>
<p>Hey, you go, you&rsquo;re a professor at Stanford,</p>
<p>which is a big deal in that world.</p>
<p>I know people that don&rsquo;t give a rat&rsquo;s ass.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t, they don&rsquo;t know where Stanford is.</p>
<p>I get that all the time.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know where Stanford is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no big deal.</p>
<p>In the SEAL teams, same thing.</p>
<p>Somebody has a problem in the SEAL teams</p>
<p>and they think this is the whole world and I blew it.</p>
<p>And now what are they gonna do?</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re facing a significant problem in life,</p>
<p>a relationship, a problem with a job,</p>
<p>you gotta remember that you&rsquo;re in one ecosystem.</p>
<p>And if you step outside of that ecosystem,</p>
<p>no one really cares.</p>
<p>And you could go move into a whole</p>
<p>totally different ecosystem and find happiness there.</p>
<p>But at least utilize that to get out of that storm cloud</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re gonna find that there&rsquo;s plenty of light</p>
<p>out there in the world.</p>
<p>Move towards that and it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>a much better situation.</p>
<p>In the spirit of authenticity,</p>
<p>everything you&rsquo;re saying hits directly home for me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what people&rsquo;s perceptions of me are.</p>
<p>I actually try not to spend too much time</p>
<p>thinking about that and just really try</p>
<p>and stay in touch with the source.</p>
<p>And I really do believe in this notion</p>
<p>that our love of things is what can generate energy.</p>
<p>And I try and use action to generate energy.</p>
<p>But I happen to also love exercise.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an easy one there for me.</p>
<p>But I try and stay in that mode.</p>
<p>But to be quite honest, I&rsquo;ve spent much of my adult life</p>
<p>and probably too much of my teenage life in 20s.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not quite an adult, right, in your 20s.</p>
<p>At least I certainly wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>In challenging relationships</p>
<p>that admittedly were challenging</p>
<p>because of my role in them also, of course, right?</p>
<p>And each and every time I remember thinking</p>
<p>moving on from this is like this insurmountable thing.</p>
<p>In part because I&rsquo;m a caretaker and I cared</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t just about me and a selfishness.</p>
<p>It was about wanting to right all the wrongs</p>
<p>of that person&rsquo;s past.</p>
<p>Like I found myself trying to be a time machine for people.</p>
<p>I found myself trying to fix their family lives.</p>
<p>I found myself doing all of that</p>
<p>and also ignoring all the things I needed to focus on</p>
<p>in terms of bettering myself</p>
<p>and making sure I was showing up correct and on and on.</p>
<p>And there are data in the world</p>
<p>in the form of these people that know me very, very well</p>
<p>that I think would say that and a whole lot more, right?</p>
<p>The point isn&rsquo;t those specific relationships,</p>
<p>but each and every time,</p>
<p>someone would come along and say like,</p>
<p>listen, if this isn&rsquo;t good for you, it&rsquo;s not good for them.</p>
<p>Or this is a bad situation</p>
<p>or this isn&rsquo;t serving either of you well.</p>
<p>But I was like myopic, like this big</p>
<p>and not even so distraught view of the world,</p>
<p>like sans spec of the world and trying to solve</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s my nature.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m gonna solve this, I&rsquo;m gonna solve it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna solve it.</p>
<p>And sometimes things were solved for some period of time</p>
<p>and sometimes they weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I think one thing that just as a confessional,</p>
<p>like I will say,</p>
<p>I could really learn the art of detachment.</p>
<p>I could really learn to focus on that more</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s the proper language for it.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m pretty good at adapting.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m pretty good at finding good people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly love my team</p>
<p>and that all feels like natural synergy,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s hard work in lab and in the podcast.</p>
<p>But I think the sort of tendency that I have</p>
<p>as a problem solver is to assume</p>
<p>that every problem can be solved</p>
<p>and therefore staying on this problem</p>
<p>until it is solved is the answer.</p>
<p>And maybe the art of detachment</p>
<p>and getting some perspective would help</p>
<p>because if I look back,</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t regret the experiences that I&rsquo;ve had,</p>
<p>but I wasted far too much time.</p>
<p>And frankly, I probably wasted far too much</p>
<p>of other people&rsquo;s time trying to solve problems</p>
<p>that could not be solved.</p>
<p>And I think without going into this in any more detail</p>
<p>and of course you&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>you can send me a bill at the end, by the way.</p>
<p>I think this is-</p>
<p>Confessions are free, man.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think that being a problem solver is great.</p>
<p>Being forward center of mass is great.</p>
<p>I think learning the systems of the brain and body</p>
<p>and understanding psychology and learning about oneself,</p>
<p>you know, the Oracle had it right,</p>
<p>know thyself in ways that you can maneuver functionally</p>
<p>in your life and career and relationship, et cetera, great.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s also a downside to being overly fixated.</p>
<p>It was like my bulldog Costello</p>
<p>used to be like chewing on something,</p>
<p>chewing on something.</p>
<p>Next thing I know he&rsquo;s chewing on his foot</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, hey,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d have to like rip him off his own foot</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;d be like.</p>
<p>Because that chew reflex was just so strong</p>
<p>that sometimes it would turn on himself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of how it feels.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wrote a book called</p>
<p>Leadership Strategy and Tactics.</p>
<p>And one of the things that I wrote about in that book</p>
<p>is like understanding what&rsquo;s important and what&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>And this is very similar to what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Looking at a problem</p>
<p>and taking a step back and going,</p>
<p>well, A, is this important or not?</p>
<p>And B, is this solvable or is it not?</p>
<p>And C, what&rsquo;s the ROI on getting it solved</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s the effort it&rsquo;s gonna take</p>
<p>to get this problem solved</p>
<p>and how much is it really gonna impact my world</p>
<p>and my life if I focus on it?</p>
<p>So knowing and understanding</p>
<p>when something&rsquo;s important or not is a very good skill.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s a skill that&rsquo;s directly related</p>
<p>to detachment.</p>
<p>Because when you&rsquo;re in that relationship,</p>
<p>this is another thing I&rsquo;ve been telling people lately,</p>
<p>the solution to your problem</p>
<p>is not gonna be found in the problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna be found in there.</p>
<p>You have to get out of the problem</p>
<p>so that you can look at it, make an assessment,</p>
<p>and you can assess how to solve the problem</p>
<p>or whether you need to solve the problem or not.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of things in my life right now</p>
<p>where I shrug my shoulders and go, okay.</p>
<p>Okay, someone&rsquo;s saying this.</p>
<p>Okay, roger that.</p>
<p>But carry on, no factor, move on.</p>
<p>And then occasionally you go,</p>
<p>okay, this is something I need to contend with.</p>
<p>This is something I need to deal with.</p>
<p>This is something I need to shape or adjust or move</p>
<p>or solve, to use your word.</p>
<p>The reason I laugh when I say that is because</p>
<p>problems, you have to get in there.</p>
<p>But if you take a step back, you can usually say,</p>
<p>oh, little adjustment here, a little adjustment there,</p>
<p>and that thing&rsquo;s gonna sort itself out.</p>
<p>Detachment is a superpower, man.</p>
<p>Certainly is, and it&rsquo;s certainly one</p>
<p>that I need to focus on more.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful for you bringing that up.</p>
<p>This is the biologist in me, but what is your process</p>
<p>for engaging detachment or for disengaging?</p>
<p>Is it an active process where you go,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m gonna detach from this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna put myself in a situation that is pulling on me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this gravitational force,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna, I don&rsquo;t know, create some imagery</p>
<p>in my mind of walking away from it.</p>
<p>Do I physically walk away from it?</p>
<p>Do I outsource it to somebody else?</p>
<p>What are some tools for detachment?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is one of those situations</p>
<p>where you and I had a discussion about the science</p>
<p>and the practical application aligned.</p>
<p>So my original experience with detachment was,</p>
<p>and this is one of those moments where, you know,</p>
<p>I said a lot of times things are just small moments</p>
<p>over time and you make a little adjustment.</p>
<p>This is one of those moments in my life.</p>
<p>And I wrote about leadership strategy and tactics</p>
<p>where I recognized like in a moment what detachment was</p>
<p>and how helpful it was.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on an oil rig doing a training mission.</p>
<p>My whole platoon is in a skirmish line</p>
<p>looking at a large area of the oil rig</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re supposed to be clearing.</p>
<p>Again, this is not combat.</p>
<p>This is in the 90s.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing going on.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just doing training.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m standing in this skirmish line.</p>
<p>And by the way,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the youngest and most junior guy in my platoon.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m standing there looking down the sight of my weapon</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m waiting for someone to make a call</p>
<p>and tell us what to do.</p>
<p>And I wait for five seconds and I wait for 10 seconds</p>
<p>and I wait for 20 seconds and no one&rsquo;s saying anything.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re waiting for a leader in my platoon to make a call</p>
<p>to tell us what to do, to tell me what to do.</p>
<p>And finally, after like 30 seconds,</p>
<p>which seems like an eternity, I can&rsquo;t take it anymore.</p>
<p>And so I take a step like a foot, a one foot step,</p>
<p>12 inches, I take a step off the skirmish line.</p>
<p>I look to my left, I look to my right.</p>
<p>And what I see is every other guy in my platoon</p>
<p>is staring down their weapon,</p>
<p>staring down the sight of their weapon,</p>
<p>which means their field of view is tiny.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a 20 degree field of view.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking down the scope of your weapon</p>
<p>or the sight of your weapon.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how big their field of view is.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m looking and I&rsquo;m thinking,</p>
<p>oh, there&rsquo;s my platoon commander.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s looking down the scope, the sight of his weapon.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s my platoon chief.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s looking down the side of his weapon.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s my leading petty officer.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s looking down the side of his weapon.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s my assistant platoon commander.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s looking down.</p>
<p>So everyone in the platoon is looking down the side</p>
<p>of their weapon, which means they all have</p>
<p>a very narrow field of vision.</p>
<p>Well, when I take a step back and look to my left</p>
<p>and look to my right,</p>
<p>guess what kind of field of vision I got?</p>
<p>I got a massive one.</p>
<p>I can see the whole scene</p>
<p>and I can see exactly what it is we need to do.</p>
<p>And at that moment, look, as a new guy,</p>
<p>you need to keep your mouth shut.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m thinking, well, but no one else is saying anything.</p>
<p>So I muster up all the courage I can.</p>
<p>And I open my mouth and I say, hold left, clear right,</p>
<p>which is a basic tactical call.</p>
<p>Nope, nope, nope.</p>
<p>This is not a patent level genius maneuver.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a normal call to make in a situation</p>
<p>that we were in.</p>
<p>And I say, hold left, clear right.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m expecting to get kind of slapped,</p>
<p>told shut up, new guy.</p>
<p>But instead, everyone just repeats the call,</p>
<p>hold left, clear right, hold left, clear right.</p>
<p>And we execute the maneuver</p>
<p>and we finish the clearance of this oil rig</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll get done.</p>
<p>We get to the top of the oil rig,</p>
<p>which means we cleared the whole thing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re on the helo deck at the top and we go into a debrief.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m expecting, okay, now I&rsquo;m gonna get told,</p>
<p>hey, what were you doing?</p>
<p>You need to keep your mouth shut.</p>
<p>And instead the platoon chief goes,</p>
<p>hey, Jonko, good call on the cellar deck down there.</p>
<p>And I was kind of like, yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But then I thought to myself, hold on a second.</p>
<p>Why, if I&rsquo;m the youngest, most junior guy in this platoon,</p>
<p>why was I able to see what we needed to do</p>
<p>and make that call?</p>
<p>Why did that just happen?</p>
<p>And then I realized it was because I took a step back</p>
<p>to use your term.</p>
<p>I broadened my field of view,</p>
<p>which allowed me to think more clearly</p>
<p>because instead of being hyper-focused</p>
<p>and narrowly focused, I broadened my range of vision.</p>
<p>I took a breath before I made my call, right?</p>
<p>I had to take a nice breath to speak clearly.</p>
<p>And I realized that taking a step back and detaching,</p>
<p>I got to see infinitely more</p>
<p>than even the most experienced guys in my platoon.</p>
<p>And I started doing it all the time.</p>
<p>And I started doing it in land warfare.</p>
<p>I started doing it in urban combat.</p>
<p>I started doing it in all these tactical training scenarios.</p>
<p>These are just training.</p>
<p>This is the nineties.</p>
<p>I started doing these training scenarios</p>
<p>and it always allowed me to see what we needed to do.</p>
<p>And then I started doing it</p>
<p>like when I was having conversations with people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having a conversation with my platoon chief</p>
<p>and I can see that he&rsquo;s starting to turn a little red</p>
<p>in the face and we&rsquo;re about to argue about something.</p>
<p>I said, oh, wait a second, I&rsquo;m taking a step back.</p>
<p>Look and vote.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s getting mad right now.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s the platoon chief.</p>
<p>You better just deescalate this thing real quick.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d say, hey, you know what, chief, that sounds good.</p>
<p>Let me go take a relook at the plan or whatever.</p>
<p>And so I started to do this kind of with my normal life</p>
<p>was to not get wrapped up in my own emotions,</p>
<p>not get wrapped up in the gunfight</p>
<p>that was happening right in front of my face,</p>
<p>not to get wrapped up in the details of what was going on,</p>
<p>but instead take a step back, detach, look around,</p>
<p>and then you can make a much, much better decision.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s exponential.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking down the sights of your weapon</p>
<p>and you take a step back and you look around,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s exponential how much more you can see.</p>
<p>Now, listen, if you are the only person in a gunfight,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be harder for you to do that</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve got to be focused</p>
<p>on whatever you&rsquo;re shooting at.</p>
<p>But when you have 16 guys or 20 guys,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all looking in the same direction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to be the guy that goes on</p>
<p>and take a step back, look around, make a call.</p>
<p>So when you talk about the mechanics,</p>
<p>when I teach this to people now,</p>
<p>the mechanics of it, take a step back.</p>
<p>Literally, you&rsquo;re at, you know, you and I are at a meeting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of people</p>
<p>that starts to get heated argument.</p>
<p>I will literally push my chair back away from the table,</p>
<p>change my perspective, open, widen my field of view.</p>
<p>And the other thing, like in the SEAL teams,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t wanna sound panicked on the radio</p>
<p>for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>Number one, because when you panic on the radio,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna cause other people to panic.</p>
<p>Number two, if you panic on the radio</p>
<p>and you sound panicked, everyone&rsquo;s gonna make fun of you.</p>
<p>So, you know, when you get back from the mission,</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s gonna go,</p>
<p>yeah, you sounded like a baby out there.</p>
<p>So what would I do before I would key up my radio?</p>
<p>Take a breath.</p>
<p>And so here I&rsquo;m manually slowing down my breath.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m broadening my field of view.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re in a meeting or you&rsquo;re in a, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re at the supermarket parking lot</p>
<p>and someone starts to yell at you, take a step back,</p>
<p>take a breath, broaden your field of view,</p>
<p>detach from those emotions that you&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>and make some space.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how I go through the mechanics of detachment.</p>
<p>Now, I can tell you right now,</p>
<p>I mean, when you do this all the time,</p>
<p>which I kind of do this all the time,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really have to like step back,</p>
<p>but when you&rsquo;re starting to be able to try and do this,</p>
<p>absolutely, make a mechanic.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s another like weird little nuanced thing.</p>
<p>Lift your chin up and put your hands down.</p>
<p>Now this is not in a combat situation, not in a fight,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the thing, when I get defensive,</p>
<p>what am I gonna do?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna raise my hands up and put my chin down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a fighting mode.</p>
<p>So if you and I are having a discussion</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m starting to get heated and I&rsquo;m starting to like,</p>
<p>oh, he&rsquo;s not listening to me,</p>
<p>instead of me putting my chin down and put my hands</p>
<p>like up to where I can put them in your face a little bit,</p>
<p>no, I&rsquo;m actually gonna take a step back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna say, put my chin up.</p>
<p>It changes my perspective a little bit more,</p>
<p>changes my visual perspective,</p>
<p>just by changing the angle of my head.</p>
<p>Take a step back, put my hands down.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not being in a defensive mood.</p>
<p>I actually wanna hear what you have to say.</p>
<p>And if I start listening to what you have to say</p>
<p>and not talking, it&rsquo;s very hard to be detached</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another key component.</p>
<p>You wanna detach, shut your mouth.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m in meetings in a bunch of different companies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m running, I own a bunch of different companies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in a meeting in my companies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the one that&rsquo;s doing all the talking.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m doing mostly listening.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m in task unit bruiser, my task unit,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sitting there giving the entire brief.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m letting the platoon chief and the platoon</p>
<p>commanders give those briefs.</p>
<p>And that way I&rsquo;m detached.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m listening to what they have to say.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more capable of seeing what holes there are</p>
<p>in their plans by not moving my mouth,</p>
<p>not talking, I&rsquo;m listening.</p>
<p>So those are some of the methodologies that I use</p>
<p>and that I advise people to use in order to effectively</p>
<p>start down the pathway of being able to detach</p>
<p>in various scenarios.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m saying I love it because I do love it.</p>
<p>And thank you.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a wonderful technique.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked before on your podcast and some of my listeners,</p>
<p>maybe not all to this podcast,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be familiar with the fact that when we narrowly</p>
<p>focus our gaze on one target, a number of things happen.</p>
<p>Our visual world becomes constricted, of course,</p>
<p>but also that we start slicing time more finely</p>
<p>and the dopamine system tends to start doing a kind of a</p>
<p>anticipation and trying to guide and direct things</p>
<p>in that narrow tunnel of view.</p>
<p>Whereas when we literally take on panoramic vision,</p>
<p>so not necessarily moving our head around,</p>
<p>although one could, but broadening our field of view</p>
<p>or looking at a horizon, especially if we&rsquo;re walking,</p>
<p>but getting that kind of,</p>
<p>not kind of getting a broader field of view,</p>
<p>we slice time differently.</p>
<p>Things don&rsquo;t feel as imposing on us.</p>
<p>This is the physiological substrate underlying</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re describing.</p>
<p>And I think it goes a step further because in that open</p>
<p>larger aperture of visual understanding,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an open larger window of cognitive understanding</p>
<p>and new options start to surface, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I think this is,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been fascinated by the fact that this actually,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell this real quick story.</p>
<p>In 2015, I was, I went over to Spain</p>
<p>to do some mountaineering with Wim Hof.</p>
<p>Okay, this wasn&rsquo;t because I wanted a podcast.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have any social media.</p>
<p>I just went over there because I&rsquo;d heard this guy, Wim,</p>
<p>contacted him and somehow arranged a trip for myself.</p>
<p>And I went over there and we did some crazy,</p>
<p>dangerous mountaineering that I had no business doing.</p>
<p>Almost ripped my left leg off in a stunt</p>
<p>that was organized by others there</p>
<p>that I never should have done.</p>
<p>In any case, one day, look,</p>
<p>and Wim is like crouched on the ground next to like a curb</p>
<p>in this parking lot before a hike.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s down there on the ground with a little stick.</p>
<p>And I was like, what are you doing?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, look.</p>
<p>And there were ants climbing up this thing.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, they&rsquo;re mountaineering this curb.</p>
<p>And I thought, wow, this guy&rsquo;s different, right?</p>
<p>But then I realized we were about to do the same thing</p>
<p>up this big face.</p>
<p>And I thought, wow, like he&rsquo;s able to think</p>
<p>at these different scales and see similarities.</p>
<p>I thought, that&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>
<p>I would have never stopped to look there.</p>
<p>And I still remember it, right?</p>
<p>And was it profound?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Was it interesting?</p>
<p>Yeah, in the sense that things are happening</p>
<p>at all scales all the time.</p>
<p>We think we know the scale to pay attention to.</p>
<p>And we think that that&rsquo;s the one that matters most.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that in a gunfight,</p>
<p>like there is a scale that matters most,</p>
<p>but new options, new perspectives actually come</p>
<p>from that broader field of view,</p>
<p>which is what you&rsquo;re describing.</p>
<p>And later that day, it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>because this group going up,</p>
<p>some of them were really challenged in the climb.</p>
<p>And Wim went back to this example</p>
<p>of how the ants would stack on top of one another.</p>
<p>And he used an analogy from that</p>
<p>to help people through this climb.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a beautiful pool at the top, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think that these examples are in fact meaningful,</p>
<p>especially the ones that you gave,</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t just relate to military.</p>
<p>I mean, you can imagine around the dinner table,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had this, you know, kids are there and partners there.</p>
<p>And sometimes it&rsquo;s really nice to sit back</p>
<p>and just kind of hear it all and bask in it all.</p>
<p>But oftentimes like new information will surface.</p>
<p>Like you said, you know,</p>
<p>like all I&rsquo;m hearing is worries out of this person,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re not even really here.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all talking about what we&rsquo;re going to do next,</p>
<p>next time, next time, next time.</p>
<p>And kind of like you re-anchor people to like,</p>
<p>hey, like maybe let&rsquo;s focus on what we&rsquo;re doing here.</p>
<p>Or sometimes people are hyper-focused</p>
<p>on what&rsquo;s happening there,</p>
<p>and they need to think about something in the future.</p>
<p>I love this.</p>
<p>I need to practice detachment</p>
<p>in a number of different domains of my life.</p>
<p>One thing that I&rsquo;m realizing</p>
<p>after hearing you describe the process,</p>
<p>I really need to do is I need to start taking</p>
<p>some time away from my work,</p>
<p>maybe even a little bit of time parallel to relationship</p>
<p>to sort of get better perspective on it.</p>
<p>Because I think the problem-solving nature in us</p>
<p>really makes us myopic, really makes us nearsighted.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s, you see this a lot.</p>
<p>I mean, I get to see this a lot.</p>
<p>We do events with companies, businesses,</p>
<p>and we go offsite somewhere where they&rsquo;re detached.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just, they&rsquo;re de facto detached</p>
<p>from their day-to-day business.</p>
<p>You pull someone out of their business for two days,</p>
<p>and all of a sudden they start seeing the solutions.</p>
<p>What they never see them,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot harder for them to see them</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re in the firefight.</p>
<p>You get them out of the firefight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for them to see it</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re in that acquisition that they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>How are we gonna merge these two cultures?</p>
<p>This is gonna be impossible.</p>
<p>Boom, pull them out.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s talk about the two cultures.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s talk about what possible outcomes are.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, when you get them to take a step back,</p>
<p>the solutions will appear.</p>
<p>And it is true in a gunfight.</p>
<p>Now, listen, if it&rsquo;s a one-on-one gunfight,</p>
<p>even then, the ability to take a step back</p>
<p>and look around or use your peripheral vision,</p>
<p>you have to be able to do this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna increase, it&rsquo;s exponential how much it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s like a superpower.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like cheating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like cheating.</p>
<p>You know, I was speaking of Seth Stone.</p>
<p>Seth Stone took over, he became a task unit commander,</p>
<p>a troop commander when we got back from Ramadi.</p>
<p>And so now he&rsquo;s the guy in charge.</p>
<p>And now I was running the training.</p>
<p>And a couple months into his training, he broke his neck,</p>
<p>broke his vertebrae in his neck.</p>
<p>His spinal cord was okay.</p>
<p>So he was, you know, the guy with the big neck brace on</p>
<p>and he couldn&rsquo;t do any arduous training.</p>
<p>And his SEAL task unit, which is two platoons,</p>
<p>was going through their land warfare training.</p>
<p>And he couldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t carry a rucksack, couldn&rsquo;t carry a machine gun.</p>
<p>So he couldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>So I said, hey, I&rsquo;m coming out, let&rsquo;s go out</p>
<p>and you can observe your guys and see how they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And so there we are, we&rsquo;re out in the desert.</p>
<p>His troop is going through field training exercise</p>
<p>or full mission profile.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like a big fake operation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fake target, there&rsquo;s fake bad guys.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re using these laser,</p>
<p>these high-speed laser guns to shoot.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re kind of standing on this little berm.</p>
<p>And at a certain point in the operation,</p>
<p>his whole task unit, like 40 guys,</p>
<p>gets pinned down in this little ravine.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re kind of standing in the ravine with these guys</p>
<p>and no one&rsquo;s making any decisions.</p>
<p>And the enemy with these laser guns</p>
<p>are starting to maneuver and starting to,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re killing guys,</p>
<p>because these laser guns, you can die.</p>
<p>And Seth like hits me on the arm.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, can I tell him what to do?</p>
<p>And I was like, no, let him figure it out.</p>
<p>So another 30 seconds pass,</p>
<p>another guy gets killed with laser.</p>
<p>He hits me again, bro, let me say something to him.</p>
<p>And I was like, no, let him figure it out.</p>
<p>Another minute goes by, two more guys are now dead,</p>
<p>just laser dead, but they&rsquo;re dead.</p>
<p>And he hits me again and he&rsquo;s like, bro, let me tell him.</p>
<p>And I go, all right, go ahead and tell him.</p>
<p>And so he just crouches down next to one of the guys</p>
<p>and bangs him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Peel right.</p>
<p>And which is again, it&rsquo;s just a fundamental basic call.</p>
<p>And the guy shouts it out, peel right.</p>
<p>And they start peeling right.</p>
<p>And another minute later,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all out of the kill zone and everything&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>And then Seth looks at me and he goes,</p>
<p>man, this is so easy way up here.</p>
<p>And I said, bro, look at where we are.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in the ravine with the guys.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re on a knee and the guys are laying down,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not this, we weren&rsquo;t on some elevated position.</p>
<p>And I said, hey, it&rsquo;s not that we&rsquo;re in an elevated position.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that we&rsquo;re detached and looking around.</p>
<p>And he goes, oh my God.</p>
<p>And I said, hey, you remember when you</p>
<p>and I went through this training?</p>
<p>And he goes, yeah.</p>
<p>And I go, this is what it was like for me all the time.</p>
<p>I was constantly just looking around.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why it seems like a magic power, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a superpower.</p>
<p>Cause you know, Seth&rsquo;s down there with his gun</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s shooting.</p>
<p>Hey bro, move your guys over to that,</p>
<p>go to that ridge line right there, set security, boom.</p>
<p>And he, how did Jocko see that?</p>
<p>Jocko must be a tactical genius.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not a tactical genius.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just taking a step back and looking around.</p>
<p>And this, and like you just said,</p>
<p>it applies to everything that we do.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re having a conversation</p>
<p>with your significant other and you start to see</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re getting frustrated about something.</p>
<p>Now look, if you&rsquo;re in the conversation, 100%,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get frustrated too.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re frustrated.</p>
<p>Next thing you know, you&rsquo;ve got a,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got an emotional argument going on.</p>
<p>Whereas if you take a mental step back and say,</p>
<p>wait a minute, why are they frustrated right now?</p>
<p>Oh, because I&rsquo;m trying to solve their problem</p>
<p>when really what they&rsquo;re looking to do is vent.</p>
<p>Okay, got it.</p>
<p>Let them vent.</p>
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
<p>Oh, that sounds horrible.</p>
<p>You know, what do you think you&rsquo;re gonna do?</p>
<p>Instead of saying, well, if that&rsquo;s the problem,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what you should do.</p>
<p>Cause people are always looking for that.</p>
<p>So yeah, this thing, this ability is,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s something that can absolutely be trained.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, what&rsquo;s cool about it.</p>
<p>It can absolutely be trained.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a natural gift.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, some people will be better at it than others,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s something that you can train.</p>
<p>And I used to see guys develop it.</p>
<p>And I see people develop it now in the business world</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;ll report back to me.</p>
<p>You know, we had a meeting with the union today</p>
<p>and the union started escalating what they wanted to do.</p>
<p>And I just took, I detached and we ended up deescalating it.</p>
<p>Now we got a solution.</p>
<p>So this is an absolute skillset that can be learned.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what makes it especially nice</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s some people, look,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re very articulate,</p>
<p>born very, some people are born more articulate</p>
<p>than other people.</p>
<p>Some people are born with an ability to simplify things</p>
<p>more than others.</p>
<p>And you can train, you know, you could become</p>
<p>more articulate.</p>
<p>You can become, you can learn to simplify things more.</p>
<p>And some people are gonna be naturally good at detaching,</p>
<p>but everyone can get better at it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>It is a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m highly incentivized to do this.</p>
<p>I mean, there are areas of my life</p>
<p>that are going really well</p>
<p>that I also want to apply it there.</p>
<p>I think that I&rsquo;ve tended to rely on people close to me</p>
<p>as a way to access this detachment.</p>
<p>I will be very direct in saying that, you know,</p>
<p>I am not the leader of my podcast.</p>
<p>There is a leader.</p>
<p>It is not me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m part of the team, but it is not me.</p>
<p>And I often rely on his input.</p>
<p>And sometimes that input is solicited</p>
<p>and sometimes it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>One place, for instance, where you see people</p>
<p>getting really myopic is on social media, right?</p>
<p>And, you know, and I&rsquo;ve experienced this, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to say that I&rsquo;m always non-reactive.</p>
<p>And I think in general, I take the stance</p>
<p>that I have filters.</p>
<p>So I have filters.</p>
<p>I know why I&rsquo;m there, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in being a teacher and a giver</p>
<p>and informing people about the beauty</p>
<p>and utility of biology.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I say it&rsquo;s not a mission statement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fact.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I care about.</p>
<p>Anything that doesn&rsquo;t fit through that filter,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really have any business doing.</p>
<p>But occasionally I like to, you know, make a joke</p>
<p>or something, but occasionally something comes through</p>
<p>and I find myself thinking, wait a second,</p>
<p>and you get sucked into that tunnel.</p>
<p>And sometimes it&rsquo;s observing other people in tunnels.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re not in the tunnel,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so obvious what&rsquo;s happening, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re watching, in some cases,</p>
<p>people just dragging their lives,</p>
<p>in some cases sinking their entire careers.</p>
<p>I mean, the former chair of psychiatry</p>
<p>at Columbia University in New York</p>
<p>made an absolutely foolish, truly insensitive,</p>
<p>totally inappropriate tweet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my opinion.</p>
<p>And I think it was the opinion of all the people</p>
<p>that fired him from his job.</p>
<p>This person was at the apex of his career,</p>
<p>lost his job for saying something terrible.</p>
<p>And in retrospect was like, said something like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what I was thinking, you know?</p>
<p>And so this guy&rsquo;s a psychiatrist.</p>
<p>So he lives in the study and the treatment of the mind,</p>
<p>which just goes to show that everyone I think</p>
<p>is susceptible to being pulled into these tunnels.</p>
<p>And fortunately everyone is susceptible to learning</p>
<p>to teach themselves how to ratchet themselves out of it.</p>
<p>So I love this idea of a teachable skill.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly gonna practice it in one-on-one</p>
<p>and in group situations and in a variety of situations.</p>
<p>I think that the tunnel has a gravitational pull.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like an allure to that tunnel.</p>
<p>And I always just go right back to the neurochemistry.</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s something about solving a problem</p>
<p>inside of a tunnel, like an animal on a chase, you know?</p>
<p>But at some point, you know,</p>
<p>that animal could get picked off by a, you know,</p>
<p>or run over by a truck because it was,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have enough situational awareness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m definitely gonna practice this through opening the gaze,</p>
<p>you know, and broadening gaze.</p>
<p>And I think I also do for a couple of days off</p>
<p>from things to just walk and think about work.</p>
<p>On these retreats, do people work on work?</p>
<p>Are they just there to do other things?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the ideas surface.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll do a little bit of both.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll do some stuff that is focused on work,</p>
<p>but then we&rsquo;ll pull out and do things</p>
<p>that are completely unrelated to work</p>
<p>to, for that very reason.</p>
<p>Whether we do something physical,</p>
<p>whether we do something, some kind of a mental exercise,</p>
<p>but we do things that are completely unrelated to their work</p>
<p>and take those breaks in order for them to free their mind.</p>
<p>And you know what bothers you about social media?</p>
<p>This is, when you say like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some things that kind of like make you mad.</p>
<p>No, I mean, not me, but you know, could be,</p>
<p>no, of course, of course, like I&rsquo;m a human, you know,</p>
<p>little things, little things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the things that are obvious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually not direct critique of me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when people exploit misunderstandings</p>
<p>to try and create a greater misunderstanding</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what gets me, because to a scientist,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like the most irritating thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the analogy would be in the SEAL teams,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like someone like hijacking something</p>
<p>that like, they didn&rsquo;t mean that,</p>
<p>but then they kind of, they distort the argument.</p>
<p>The word gaslighting gets thrown around a lot now.</p>
<p>A lot of people actually think that anytime</p>
<p>someone states a boundary, like, no,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that&rsquo;s that, that that&rsquo;s gaslighting.</p>
<p>Trust me, the psychiatrists who are all professionally trained</p>
<p>tell me that is not gaslighting.</p>
<p>Gaslighting is a very particular thing</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re trying to alter someone&rsquo;s reality</p>
<p>in a very active, almost like sociopathic way.</p>
<p>So I just want, that&rsquo;s a little editorializing right there.</p>
<p>What bothers me is when people hijack,</p>
<p>you know, sometimes someone in an argument</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t as sophisticated with their language as somebody else.</p>
<p>So someone will hijack that lack of sophistication</p>
<p>and try and flip them on their back.</p>
<p>That sort of thing really gets under my skin</p>
<p>because I feel that creates unnecessary divide.</p>
<p>There are a few other things, but you know,</p>
<p>I always joke in my lab, and I&rsquo;ll say it right now,</p>
<p>you know, I have 3,000 pet peeves,</p>
<p>but I also have like 3,000 flaws</p>
<p>to match each one of those pet peeves, so.</p>
<p>Yeah, I, whenever I&rsquo;m, and this is not just social media,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just life, you know,</p>
<p>when somebody says something about me</p>
<p>or to me that I don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>what I realized years ago is like,</p>
<p>the reason I don&rsquo;t like it is</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s some truth in what they&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>And the best thing to do is to say either to yourself,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re by yourself or to them,</p>
<p>is to say, yeah, yeah, yeah, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I am kind of a knucklehead sometimes,</p>
<p>or yeah, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I sometimes do jump to conclusions,</p>
<p>or yeah, yeah, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I was completely wrong about that.</p>
<p>And that is just so much more liberating and healthy</p>
<p>than saying, you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>or no, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Just going into that defensive mode</p>
<p>and trying to close your mind</p>
<p>instead of opening your mind up</p>
<p>to listen to what somebody else has to say</p>
<p>and say, yeah, that&rsquo;s a good point.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re spot on with that one.</p>
<p>Next question, next comment, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>One thing I appreciate about you on social media</p>
<p>is the limited number of words in each of your responses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great thing,</p>
<p>and forcing you to be efficient and concise</p>
<p>actually is a huge advantage.</p>
<p>It also forces you to be precise,</p>
<p>at least about category, right?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s something to be said for that.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a good example.</p>
<p>So I was on Twitter the other day,</p>
<p>since Twitter&rsquo;s getting a lot of traction right now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of mayhem going on in Twitter.</p>
<p>The other gun fight.</p>
<p>And somebody asked me, somebody said,</p>
<p>hey, I&rsquo;m going to bootcamp soon.</p>
<p>What advice do you have for me?</p>
<p>And I wrote back, enjoy, boom.</p>
<p>And like you said, I mean, it&rsquo;s Twitter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m responding to a bunch of people.</p>
<p>And then somebody else chimed in and said,</p>
<p>might as well not even answer Jocko.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not helping this guy at all.</p>
<p>And look at your face, for those of you that are watching.</p>
<p>Your face just got a little bit mad, right?</p>
<p>You got a little bit defensive for me.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I think that&rsquo;s my nature.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like seeing other people sort of attacked.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s just my nature.</p>
<p>And I had a split second of who the hell is this guy?</p>
<p>And then I said, you know what, he&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And then I tweeted again back.</p>
<p>Like I said, sorry, man, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>What I should have said was,</p>
<p>hey, read the book, Leadership Strategy and Tactics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good book for someone that is going to be</p>
<p>in an environment that&rsquo;s gonna be challenging.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re gonna be faced with leadership challenges.</p>
<p>And enjoy bootcamp, because if your mindset is,</p>
<p>this sucks and this is terrible,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be terrible and it&rsquo;s gonna suck.</p>
<p>And if you go with a mindset of,</p>
<p>hey, this is a cool experience and I should enjoy it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have a much better time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my full answer, I&rsquo;m sorry I didn&rsquo;t give you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s perfectly fine.</p>
<p>That guy was right to critique me.</p>
<p>And he was right in saying that.</p>
<p>And there was a bunch of,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s funny is a bunch of other people</p>
<p>came to my defense and said, this guy, that&rsquo;s really great.</p>
<p>So, but my point is, instead of me getting defensive</p>
<p>and crazy and letting it drive me crazy,</p>
<p>opened my mind a little bit,</p>
<p>listen to what they have to say,</p>
<p>accept that there&rsquo;s gotta be some level of truth in it.</p>
<p>And there was, I gave a guy a very, very terse response.</p>
<p>And I could have expanded on it more.</p>
<p>And I did, no big deal.</p>
<p>Good times.</p>
<p>A few minutes ago, I was thinking to myself,</p>
<p>I wonder where your mind is at,</p>
<p>like in the few moments before you fall asleep.</p>
<p>Like, are you able to make yourself go mind blank</p>
<p>pretty easily?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve been practicing more</p>
<p>because I tend to, again, ruminate.</p>
<p>I like to drill into problems, obviously.</p>
<p>Yesterday I did a solo episode,</p>
<p>which when we do those,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re usually anywhere from five to 20 hours of prep.</p>
<p>And then the recordings, I won&rsquo;t say how long they take,</p>
<p>but I love going into the tunnel, right?</p>
<p>The tunnel is like, that&rsquo;s where the juice is for me.</p>
<p>And finding the structure,</p>
<p>and I have the benefit of an amazing producer</p>
<p>who helps me sort through it.</p>
<p>And when I kind of like came out of this thing</p>
<p>and then went home, couldn&rsquo;t eat.</p>
<p>So I was just like, I don&rsquo;t want dinner.</p>
<p>And then I was explaining a call I had</p>
<p>with a colleague the other day.</p>
<p>And you know, my partner, my girlfriend,</p>
<p>she was just like, you know, like, okay,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m going to sleep.</p>
<p>And I was like up and like texting</p>
<p>and like thinking of writing notes out.</p>
<p>And I thought, oh yeah, I&rsquo;m like Costello,</p>
<p>like chewing on the stick.</p>
<p>And like they chewing into my paw, I need sleep.</p>
<p>I need to go to sleep.</p>
<p>So I think I have a bit of a harder time disengaging clearly</p>
<p>and this is why I never touched cocaine or amphetamine.</p>
<p>Because I think that some of us have a love</p>
<p>of the dopamine circuitry that I always sensed</p>
<p>if I were to have tried drugs like that,</p>
<p>that they might&rsquo;ve been the thing</p>
<p>that would like hit my neural circuits just right.</p>
<p>You know, some people talk about alcohol that way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read books by alcoholics,</p>
<p>like the book Dry and a few other,</p>
<p>Rich Roll talks about this,</p>
<p>that he drank alcohol for the first time in college.</p>
<p>And it was like this elixir that filled his body</p>
<p>that made him feel right for the first time.</p>
<p>Like, that is not how I feel after a couple of drinks.</p>
<p>I feel a little relaxed, but I can do without it.</p>
<p>But this drilling into something is really,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my, I guess maybe that&rsquo;s my,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a superpower,</p>
<p>but I have some strength there.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s also the thing</p>
<p>that can cut on the other side.</p>
<p>Yeah, when you started off this conversation early,</p>
<p>you talked about, you know, getting up in the morning</p>
<p>and do you just get up and you have these,</p>
<p>and I was about to go down the path of like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s at nighttime when I&rsquo;m trying to go to sleep</p>
<p>and I have some random thought about something</p>
<p>that can be a hard, I have a visual thing that&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>It seems like I&rsquo;m on a roller coaster</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going in like a new idea comes</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just like on this awesome ride</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not gonna stop and I can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to stop that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, I think it goes with people who are very driven</p>
<p>and like to master different crafts.</p>
<p>I have a colleague, his name is Karl Deisseroth.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a bioengineer.</p>
<p>He has five children and he&rsquo;s a psychiatrist.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like an incredible,</p>
<p>like one of these people that does a ton,</p>
<p>very likely will win the Nobel prize.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s an amazing scientist, amazing guy.</p>
<p>And he does this practice that he does,</p>
<p>which is not a meditation,</p>
<p>which is he sits for an hour late at night</p>
<p>after his kids have gone to sleep</p>
<p>and he forces himself,</p>
<p>forces himself to think in complete sentences</p>
<p>with punctuation about some problem.</p>
<p>I tried doing that for about five minutes and I fell off,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s something that he&rsquo;s cultivated in himself,</p>
<p>which helps him in his career, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this,</p>
<p>this is certainly not something I recommend.</p>
<p>If I did that at one or two in the morning,</p>
<p>I think that would be bad for my sleep</p>
<p>because falling asleep actually requires</p>
<p>drifting into these kind of liminal states.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the reasons why I&rsquo;m a big proponent</p>
<p>of things like non-sleep deep rest</p>
<p>or these yoga nidra practices,</p>
<p>which are basically body scans</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re trying to learn to detach</p>
<p>from the sensory world.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re very effective.</p>
<p>Certainly for me,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been very effective at teaching me</p>
<p>to kind of turn off thinking,</p>
<p>which is an interesting notion in its own right.</p>
<p>But I like the idea of detachment</p>
<p>by stepping back and getting perspective.</p>
<p>My father is much better at that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a very calm guy in the world of confrontation.</p>
<p>I always knew it when I was a kid,</p>
<p>he would blink, which meant like something was gonna happen.</p>
<p>Like I was gonna get it.</p>
<p>And now, but I&rsquo;ve always noticed he can control</p>
<p>his responses and his behavior.</p>
<p>Others of us in the family,</p>
<p>aside from New Jersey,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re more like go to loggerheads.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>This raises a question.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s one that I and several other people</p>
<p>I talked to in anticipation of this podcast were asking.</p>
<p>I think one reason why people are drawn</p>
<p>to people who have been in the SEAL teams</p>
<p>and you in particular are that,</p>
<p>I think everybody, not just males,</p>
<p>but females too.</p>
<p>I think everybody wants to know</p>
<p>their calibration point on their level of toughness.</p>
<p>I think people wonder.</p>
<p>I think when people talk about buds and all that,</p>
<p>I think a lot of people wonder, would I make it through?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve certainly wondered it.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t spent hours on it.</p>
<p>I went my path.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy for the path I went.</p>
<p>But I think people wonder,</p>
<p>do I have this thing that supposedly buds selects for?</p>
<p>And if I don&rsquo;t, how tough am I or not tough am I?</p>
<p>I think that we all can look at other people physically.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not somebody that does a lot of this.</p>
<p>I know some people are really obsessed by this.</p>
<p>Like, oh, that person has like an eight pack</p>
<p>with a like veins on there.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t understand that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not me.</p>
<p>But I understand some people do that</p>
<p>even to the point of pathology.</p>
<p>But I think most people wonder like, how resilient am I?</p>
<p>And they can look to experiences that they&rsquo;ve survived</p>
<p>and say, whew, I made it through or I&rsquo;m resilient or not.</p>
<p>But is there a way that like we can,</p>
<p>certainly that we can train it by doing hard things,</p>
<p>cold showers, this kind of thing,</p>
<p>or like small examples of those.</p>
<p>But do you think it&rsquo;s even an important question to ask?</p>
<p>And if it is, you know, how does one go about thinking?</p>
<p>Like where, like how resilient am I?</p>
<p>Should we put ourself into situations of discomfort</p>
<p>just to test that?</p>
<p>Because I will say, I think a lot of people look to</p>
<p>SEAL teams and team guys in particular</p>
<p>as kind of a calibration point of like,</p>
<p>okay, they know how to do hard things.</p>
<p>They were selected for the ability to carry logs</p>
<p>and get into cold water over and over and roll in the sand</p>
<p>and go without sleep for a week or so.</p>
<p>Like, but that&rsquo;s probably not what they were doing</p>
<p>when they were on deployment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clearly a pressure test for something else.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a strange, strange thing.</p>
<p>The basic underwater demolition SEAL training.</p>
<p>And quite frankly, going and getting wet and cold</p>
<p>and being miserable is actually nothing</p>
<p>compared to like being on deployment.</p>
<p>And a good example that I use to compare this to</p>
<p>is when I was on deployment in 2006 in Ramadi,</p>
<p>there was, as you were driving off base to go to the city,</p>
<p>to go into the city and conduct operations,</p>
<p>as you drove out of the compound,</p>
<p>on your right was this area</p>
<p>that was called the vehicle graveyard.</p>
<p>And the vehicle graveyard was exactly what it sounds like.</p>
<p>It was probably 75 or 100 vehicles that were blown up,</p>
<p>destroyed, burned in various twisted conditions</p>
<p>that had been dragged back through the city</p>
<p>and put into this vehicle graveyard.</p>
<p>And as you drove by that vehicle graveyard,</p>
<p>you know, without question,</p>
<p>that every one of those twisted vehicles represented</p>
<p>one, two, three, four, five American casualties.</p>
<p>American casualties, wounded, horribly wounded, killed.</p>
<p>And there you are in a vehicle</p>
<p>about to roll out into that city</p>
<p>where what you&rsquo;re looking at can easily be you</p>
<p>in the next three minutes.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re gonna do that today.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna do that tomorrow.</p>
<p>You can do that the next day and the day after that</p>
<p>and the day after that.</p>
<p>That compared to, and by the way,</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t just SEALs that are doing that.</p>
<p>This is Marines.</p>
<p>This is the Army guys that are over there.</p>
<p>This is what everyone is doing.</p>
<p>And they do it.</p>
<p>They do it.</p>
<p>I talk about Mark Lee, who&rsquo;s one of my guys,</p>
<p>first SEAL killed in Iraq.</p>
<p>And he was the lead turret gunner in the lead Humvee.</p>
<p>And like in Vietnam, if you were the point man of Vietnam,</p>
<p>if you were on an infantry patrol,</p>
<p>you were the point man of Vietnam, you were at risk,</p>
<p>booby traps, ambush.</p>
<p>So they rotated you out.</p>
<p>Like you didn&rsquo;t have to stay up there all the time.</p>
<p>You do an hour up as point man,</p>
<p>they get someone else up there.</p>
<p>And that guy, the lead turret gunner in a Humvee column</p>
<p>of four or five or six vehicles,</p>
<p>if you hit an IED, that&rsquo;s the vehicle</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna hit it, right?</p>
<p>If you go into an ambush,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the guy that&rsquo;s gonna get hit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the guy that&rsquo;s standing up in a 50 caliber turret.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the guy that&rsquo;s gonna die.</p>
<p>And Mark was, you know, he was a new guy.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s in that lead turret, 50 cal.</p>
<p>And he never asked to get rotated out.</p>
<p>And I remember, he&rsquo;s a very, like to say very,</p>
<p>he was extremely charismatic, funny, gregarious comedian.</p>
<p>And, you know, we got all kinds of stories about Mark,</p>
<p>but one of them, you know, we were in Vegas</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re all gambling.</p>
<p>And like, I come down from my hotel room</p>
<p>and like, I see Mark across the, he&rsquo;s playing blackjack.</p>
<p>You know, he sees me, he goes,</p>
<p>hey sir, when are the new Cadillacs coming out?</p>
<p>And like, he&rsquo;s just lighting up everybody,</p>
<p>just having a fantastic time.</p>
<p>But I remember one night, you know,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s getting ready to roll out.</p>
<p>And if I wasn&rsquo;t going out with the platoons,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like go out, you know, like see the guys off,</p>
<p>give them a hand salute as they&rsquo;re leaving.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, how are you feeling tomorrow?</p>
<p>How are you doing, Mark?</p>
<p>You good to go?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, feeling lucky, sir.</p>
<p>You know, like that was his attitude.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a guy that&rsquo;s gonna drive by that vehicle graveyard,</p>
<p>drive right out on that city.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s gonna do it the next day</p>
<p>and the day after that and the day after that.</p>
<p>And so, and like I said,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what the Army guys are doing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the Marine Corps guys are doing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>And so as much as the mythology</p>
<p>around basic SEAL training goes,</p>
<p>to me, that experience in combat</p>
<p>and what guys do is infinitely harder</p>
<p>and infinitely more important.</p>
<p>Now, all that being said,</p>
<p>basic SEAL training is a very strange laboratory</p>
<p>for human beings.</p>
<p>It is a very strange laboratory for human beings.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of crazy the way it works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, it&rsquo;s obviously extremely difficult,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no, like, I wouldn&rsquo;t put money,</p>
<p>you could put odds on somebody making it through.</p>
<p>You know, like, hey, that guy seems like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna be good to go.</p>
<p>But I wouldn&rsquo;t put a bunch of money on it, right?</p>
<p>And I wouldn&rsquo;t take like 100%.</p>
<p>I would never take 100% bet on anybody</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no one that&rsquo;s 100%</p>
<p>gonna make it through that training.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s just random, you know,</p>
<p>some people say, well, it&rsquo;s because of your why.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people that make it through SEAL training</p>
<p>because their ex-girlfriend said they couldn&rsquo;t make it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some other guy that makes it through</p>
<p>because they promised God that they would make it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some other guy that made it through</p>
<p>because, you know, their dad said they could never.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like every one of these examples</p>
<p>you can come up with.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s good enough for some random dude</p>
<p>to make it through.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t matter what your pedigree is,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter where you&rsquo;re from.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s guys from Iowa, there&rsquo;s guys from Florida,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s guys from wherever that make it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s guys from Iowa and there&rsquo;s guys from Florida</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s guys from wherever that don&rsquo;t make it.</p>
<p>Guys from farms, guys from Silver Spoon in their mouth,</p>
<p>and you just can&rsquo;t predict it.</p>
<p>And I mean, it has to have something to do with the fact</p>
<p>that how bad you actually wanna do it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a strange thing.</p>
<p>And I wouldn&rsquo;t, you know, I wouldn&rsquo;t try and,</p>
<p>you know, if I was in the world,</p>
<p>if I didn&rsquo;t do that training,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be trying to figure out if I could make it</p>
<p>or not, because you don&rsquo;t know, you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very strange thing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so mythical almost right now, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mythical that how hard it is.</p>
<p>And this is not too many people make it through, man.</p>
<p>15%.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, from all the folks that I&rsquo;ve talked to</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re gone through, been instructors there,</p>
<p>some we both know, seem that that 15% number</p>
<p>is unlikely to change as long</p>
<p>as they keep the process the same.</p>
<p>It just seems like about 15% of people</p>
<p>seem to have something in them</p>
<p>that can perhaps grow during that training,</p>
<p>but that it is being identified</p>
<p>and selected for rather than somehow being built up</p>
<p>across at least that phase of the early phases of training.</p>
<p>And then at some point they build on that capacity.</p>
<p>And, you know, this gets to this really</p>
<p>somewhat controversial issue, frankly,</p>
<p>like are people wired differently?</p>
<p>And listen, I started off in neural development</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll tell you that there are some universal properties</p>
<p>of neural development in all surviving humans,</p>
<p>like that you&rsquo;re going to breathe</p>
<p>without having to think about it.</p>
<p>Your heart&rsquo;s going to beat</p>
<p>without having to think about it.</p>
<p>But beyond that, there&rsquo;s a lot of variation</p>
<p>in natural levels of dopamine and serotonin.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nature, plays a powerful role, and nurture.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting though,</p>
<p>is we can&rsquo;t always predict from parents</p>
<p>what nature is going to do.</p>
<p>Recently we had someone on the podcast,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited for you to listen to it,</p>
<p>perhaps you will if I send it to you,</p>
<p>is a guy who talks about inheritable acquired traits.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t expect that because you work out</p>
<p>that your grandkids will be more muscular</p>
<p>and have better endurance.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s actually some evidence</p>
<p>that that may be the case.</p>
<p>And you go, well, how could that be?</p>
<p>We got two kinds of cells in your body.</p>
<p>It turns out you have what are called somatic cells,</p>
<p>which are all of them,</p>
<p>and then you have the germ cells,</p>
<p>which are your sperm and your wife&rsquo;s eggs.</p>
<p>Well, why wouldn&rsquo;t the DNA of the sperm cells</p>
<p>and the egg cells be modifiable by experience</p>
<p>if all the other cells aren&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>And it turns out there&rsquo;s some evidence</p>
<p>that maybe it&rsquo;s not the DNA, but that the RNA are.</p>
<p>Think about that.</p>
<p>That means that whether,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve known this,</p>
<p>that people that have been in a famine</p>
<p>several generations later,</p>
<p>their implications for blood sugar regulation</p>
<p>in their great-grandkids.</p>
<p>So the idea that experience and acquired traits</p>
<p>can change us actually has some validity.</p>
<p>And this gets into really complicated things</p>
<p>because people go, oh, this is like the giraffe</p>
<p>that had to crane its neck</p>
<p>and then gave birth to longer neck giraffes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, well, not exactly,</p>
<p>but also not entirely untrue either.</p>
<p>So I love the idea that there are inherited traits</p>
<p>and that nature and nurture play a role,</p>
<p>but that hard work may actually transmit</p>
<p>across generations.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s, in SEAL training,</p>
<p>you have kids that come through that they call legacies,</p>
<p>which means that they have a dad,</p>
<p>I think dad, brother, whatever,</p>
<p>and they do have a better chance of making it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not a guaranteed chance at all.</p>
<p>And my personal opinion is like,</p>
<p>I think a legacy kid would have a better chance</p>
<p>of making it just due to the Thanksgiving dinner</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna have to go through</p>
<p>for the rest of your life with your family.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah, if you&rsquo;re even invited,</p>
<p>which you might be on your own.</p>
<p>But yeah, maybe there&rsquo;s something to that as well.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s just more the pressure</p>
<p>that someone must feel like,</p>
<p>hey, there&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m gonna be allowed back in my home</p>
<p>if I don&rsquo;t make it through this training.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna have to just go ahead and suck it up.</p>
<p>But not everyone makes it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a bummer when that does occur.</p>
<p>Well, for people who are not thinking</p>
<p>about going through SEAL training</p>
<p>or who missed the opportunity</p>
<p>or who are not interested in that for whatever reason,</p>
<p>do you think there&rsquo;s value to doing things each day</p>
<p>that suck a little bit,</p>
<p>or from time to time doing something</p>
<p>that puts one into a state of deliberate discomfort?</p>
<p>Yeah, 100%.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, 100%.</p>
<p>I mean, even in order to improve yourself,</p>
<p>you gotta impose some discipline on yourself, right?</p>
<p>If you wanna get stronger,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve gotta do things that require strength.</p>
<p>If you wanna be tougher,</p>
<p>you gotta do things that require you to be tougher.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>Does that mean doing things that are not pleasurable?</p>
<p>So for instance, you and I have done some long podcasts.</p>
<p>And a few weeks ago, I did a series,</p>
<p>we were doing a series with Andy Galpin,</p>
<p>all about exercise and exercise science.</p>
<p>And we did six podcasts in that week,</p>
<p>the most I&rsquo;ve ever done,</p>
<p>which made doing four or five the next week</p>
<p>not so bad, but I loved every second of it.</p>
<p>And I love every second of podcasting.</p>
<p>And so it didn&rsquo;t suck, but it built up a greater capacity.</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;m asking specifically about things</p>
<p>that really feel like a splinter.</p>
<p>Is there any value to that?</p>
<p>Because I have to say there are some people I know,</p>
<p>some of them are former team,</p>
<p>they are team guys,</p>
<p>I guess you don&rsquo;t say former team guys.</p>
<p>They were out, they&rsquo;re out of the teams now,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re team guys forever,</p>
<p>who seem to not be rattled by little things.</p>
<p>Those guys in particular,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t seem to be rattled by little things.</p>
<p>And then I know people that,</p>
<p>they get the wrong size coffee at a coffee shop</p>
<p>and they dissolve into a puddle of tears, right?</p>
<p>So there does seem to be something to this whole</p>
<p>mental resilience thing and flexibility thing.</p>
<p>And I try and do something that&rsquo;s uncomfortable</p>
<p>to me about once a week,</p>
<p>something I really don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what that is,</p>
<p>but I try and do something that&rsquo;s kind of like unpleasant</p>
<p>or do something in a way that&rsquo;s unpleasant.</p>
<p>I guess the example would be getting into the cold water</p>
<p>the first thing in the morning</p>
<p>and making that decision from under the blankets</p>
<p>is a rough one for me.</p>
<p>But then it gets easier.</p>
<p>And then you wondered,</p>
<p>is it still serving the purpose that it&rsquo;s building me up?</p>
<p>So should people seek truly like bad experiences</p>
<p>provided that they&rsquo;re done in a safe way?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I think that you&rsquo;re gonna,</p>
<p>just like you would develop your legs by doing squats</p>
<p>and you would develop your back by doing pull-ups,</p>
<p>I think you would develop your resiliency</p>
<p>by doing repetitions of things</p>
<p>that require you to be tougher.</p>
<p>That actually sucks.</p>
<p>Okay, good.</p>
<p>And the reason I ask this is because I think</p>
<p>a lot of people think, well, I work out every day,</p>
<p>but then you probe them a little bit</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, but I love exercise.</p>
<p>And then, well, then that doesn&rsquo;t quite qualify</p>
<p>as something that makes you tougher, right?</p>
<p>Or they think, oh, the last reps of a set are really tough.</p>
<p>But if you love hitting failure on a set,</p>
<p>cause that&rsquo;s kind of what I seek in the gym.</p>
<p>I love that aspect of the training.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually where I know I&rsquo;m getting better.</p>
<p>It no longer serves as resilience training.</p>
<p>It more just serves as training.</p>
<p>In any case, I think that the point is clear</p>
<p>and I appreciate your answer.</p>
<p>I have to ask about something.</p>
<p>This is gonna seem like a total divergence, but it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>which is animals.</p>
<p>Because first of all, they&rsquo;re a love of mine</p>
<p>in terms of understanding the animal kingdom</p>
<p>and placing humans into the animal kingdom.</p>
<p>Second of all, I know you&rsquo;re a hunter.</p>
<p>And also I know you own dogs.</p>
<p>And the question I have is, do you ever look at people</p>
<p>or did you ever work in teams of guys</p>
<p>when you were on active duty?</p>
<p>Kind of see that the differences, you mentioned before,</p>
<p>this person&rsquo;s really good at problem solving.</p>
<p>This person&rsquo;s a little bit more creative.</p>
<p>Do you ever wonder whether or not people</p>
<p>embody different kind of animal archetypes?</p>
<p>Because I do.</p>
<p>Well, that thing where people say that dogs</p>
<p>or owners look like their dogs,</p>
<p>dogs look like their owners.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;ve seen all kinds of examples.</p>
<p>You can go on the internet and find a bunch of examples</p>
<p>of dogs that look like their owners</p>
<p>and owners that look like their dogs.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, my dog&rsquo;s awesome and-</p>
<p>Tell me about your dog.</p>
<p>Which kind of dog is it?</p>
<p>My dog is a German Shepherd.</p>
<p>His name is Odin and he&rsquo;s an awesome dog.</p>
<p>You know, like, and he&rsquo;s got a personality,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s got an interesting personality.</p>
<p>So like he doesn&rsquo;t like to like cuddle, right?</p>
<p>Like my kids will be like, oh, he doesn&rsquo;t like to cuddle.</p>
<p>No, even, you know, when we go to bed at night,</p>
<p>he goes to, you know, four feet away</p>
<p>from the foot of my bed.</p>
<p>Even if I was like, hey, jump up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve told him, jump up in here.</p>
<p>You know, we want to pet you.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll jump up in there.</p>
<p>And he just like kind of goes in that low crouch position</p>
<p>and then sort of waits until I say free dog.</p>
<p>And then he goes back down and he goes four feet away</p>
<p>from the foot of the bed and sits there.</p>
<p>Cause he&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s his, that&rsquo;s his personality</p>
<p>is to protect and set security and do his job.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>And so, you know, you&rsquo;ve got other dogs that are,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;re not good.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re at a totally different mindset.</p>
<p>So yeah, dogs have definite personalities.</p>
<p>And look, I also have, it&rsquo;s not all genetic.</p>
<p>So two of my friends got dogs that were brothers.</p>
<p>What are they called?</p>
<p>Dogo Argentinos.</p>
<p>Do you know what that is?</p>
<p>Yeah, those are hard to get in the US.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not, they might not even be legal</p>
<p>in the United States.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t tell me who these people are.</p>
<p>Not that I care, but I&rsquo;m not gonna report them.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t tell you who they are.</p>
<p>But these two guys,</p>
<p>and those two guys had different personalities.</p>
<p>The one guy is a very happy-go-lucky,</p>
<p>likes to smoke pot, likes to hang out.</p>
<p>Very, just a chill kind of playful guy.</p>
<p>The other guy&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the opposite in every category.</p>
<p>So, and they both got these dogs.</p>
<p>And you fast forward, fast forward like a year,</p>
<p>the dog that was owned by the playful guy,</p>
<p>his dog was just a big puppy licking it,</p>
<p>just wagging the tail.</p>
<p>The other dog, you had to keep it in a cage</p>
<p>or it would murder everything in sight.</p>
<p>And these dogs were brothers from the same litter</p>
<p>and they were completely opposite.</p>
<p>And so I think it has a lot more to do with,</p>
<p>with nurture than it does to do with nature.</p>
<p>But that being said, when you look at,</p>
<p>when you look at mouse,</p>
<p>I mean, mouse have a personality that is very distinct</p>
<p>compared to a German shepherd.</p>
<p>Now look, there&rsquo;s outlying mouse,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s outlying German shepherds,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s outlying, you name whatever kind of golden retriever</p>
<p>or whatever dog is known for being more playful.</p>
<p>Like you get around a mouse,</p>
<p>mouse are mouse and they&rsquo;re that way.</p>
<p>Have you been around mouse before?</p>
<p>The Belgian Malinois.</p>
<p>Yeah, a few of them.</p>
<p>My neighbor has one and that thing,</p>
<p>that is not terribly friendly, but it&rsquo;s a security dog,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t expect it to be.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know that they use them for work in the teams.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve heard that you have to keep a close eye</p>
<p>on your relationship with them</p>
<p>because if you get lax about it, they&rsquo;ll bite you.</p>
<p>Is that true?</p>
<p>The first time I saw one,</p>
<p>we were doing like a drill with using dogs</p>
<p>for the first time</p>
<p>and one of the team guide dog handlers came out.</p>
<p>And so we hit this target building</p>
<p>and they kind of pre-briefed us like,</p>
<p>hey, you get this target building</p>
<p>and this guy&rsquo;s gonna be a runner, a squirter.</p>
<p>And so we pull up in the Humvees, assault team jumps out,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of staying external,</p>
<p>I kind of want to see what&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>So the squirter goes running off</p>
<p>and the dog handler like, whatever,</p>
<p>tracks his dog on this guy and then releases,</p>
<p>it gives him whatever commands,</p>
<p>you know, whatever the commands are.</p>
<p>That thing is like totally primed,</p>
<p>like unlike anything you&rsquo;ve ever seen in your life,</p>
<p>it is just primed, it&rsquo;s tracking that guy.</p>
<p>He hits that release on that leash</p>
<p>and that thing takes off at a thousand miles an hour.</p>
<p>It jumps like, I&rsquo;m not kidding, 15 feet,</p>
<p>maybe 10 feet in the air away</p>
<p>and just chomps onto this dude, the dude goes down.</p>
<p>It was freaking awesome.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen some videos of those Malinois,</p>
<p>I guess I didn&rsquo;t, forgive me,</p>
<p>because before I didn&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re referring to,</p>
<p>but Belgian Malinois, those dogs like running up trees,</p>
<p>jumping over little rivers.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s crazy, incredibly powerful animals.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, the idea that they mimic their owners</p>
<p>has me a little concerned</p>
<p>because my last dog I had to put him down</p>
<p>was my Bulldog Costello, he&rsquo;s a Bulldog Mastiff.</p>
<p>I got him because I went to pick out a puppy basically</p>
<p>and there were eight of these Bulldogs,</p>
<p>all of them were running around</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s one in the background</p>
<p>just eating out of all of their bowls</p>
<p>and I was like, I want that one,</p>
<p>big Bulldog, biggest one in the litter,</p>
<p>laziest creature, not just dog,</p>
<p>but laziest creature that ever existed,</p>
<p>but if you need to activate, he would.</p>
<p>He was just very efficient with his energy</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think I have a Bulldog personality</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why I got him to kind of balance me out,</p>
<p>never retrieved, never did anything,</p>
<p>stole and destroyed every toy,</p>
<p>every dog park in San Diego, who&rsquo;s kind of famous there.</p>
<p>I had to bring $5 bills to pay people</p>
<p>for all the balls and things he would destroy.</p>
<p>So anyway, my apologies to all the dog owners,</p>
<p>not really, I miss them.</p>
<p>Did you train your dog or did someone else announce?</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>And was he trained to be a security dog</p>
<p>or a kind of family dog or kind of a mixture?</p>
<p>Yep, yep.</p>
<p>I mean, the true working dogs,</p>
<p>unless you have the time and effort to put into them</p>
<p>or you buy them that way,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want one of those dogs</p>
<p>that I was just describing in your house.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not for a house.</p>
<p>Unless there&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s that level,</p>
<p>my dog&rsquo;s not that level.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Did you apply some of the same principles</p>
<p>that you use in leadership of humans with your dog?</p>
<p>Yep, there are a lot of similar principles,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also, you know, there&rsquo;s some differences.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like, they&rsquo;re pack animals, right?</p>
<p>And they respond to, you know, the pack leader.</p>
<p>It is funny, you know, my dog obeys me</p>
<p>as if it&rsquo;s the command of God and my wife,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s kind of like, maybe I&rsquo;ll do what you say.</p>
<p>So they pick up on that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Dogs are very intuitive.</p>
<p>I love this idea that I was told early on</p>
<p>that they can feel your emotions.</p>
<p>I think they actually can sense how we feel,</p>
<p>not just by the intonation of our voice,</p>
<p>but I hope someday someone will figure out</p>
<p>in a non-invasive way,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t like the idea of people doing experiments</p>
<p>on dogs in an invasive way,</p>
<p>kind of like what they&rsquo;re picking up on.</p>
<p>Like for instance, we know that sharks are paying attention</p>
<p>to the amount of activity in the lateral line of fish.</p>
<p>Fish have these stretches of neurons</p>
<p>that they call the lateral line</p>
<p>that allows them to school</p>
<p>and know the distance to different things</p>
<p>and be able to steer around coral.</p>
<p>They feel proximity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be kind of like if you&rsquo;re turning a coin,</p>
<p>and they can even recognize</p>
<p>specific lateral line signatures.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;d be like you and Mark Lee</p>
<p>walking together through the dark,</p>
<p>but maybe people sift around,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re like, you don&rsquo;t have to look at him, that&rsquo;s Mark.</p>
<p>You kind of learn him into like a fish can do that.</p>
<p>Sharks can sense whether or not the lateral line</p>
<p>is I would say vibrating,</p>
<p>but firing at a particular frequency to know,</p>
<p>oh, that fish is like a little bit slower than the rest.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re, you know, hunting animals,</p>
<p>just they develop these incredible senses.</p>
<p>And I think humans have some of these kind of senses</p>
<p>in more rudimentary way.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just not forced to use them</p>
<p>unless of course, you know,</p>
<p>you are become a hunter of animals or a hunter of humans,</p>
<p>and you tap into these neural circuits</p>
<p>that are very primitive and hardwired in everybody.</p>
<p>But of course they&rsquo;re honed in warriors.</p>
<p>Where I could spiral off into animal biology</p>
<p>in ways that truly would take us 26 hours.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to do that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m almost hesitant to ask this question,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to do it anyway.</p>
<p>Many times online, you are asked whether or not</p>
<p>you will run for office.</p>
<p>And I want to say that I think it&rsquo;s a true compliment.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think people are asking</p>
<p>just to kind of entertain themselves.</p>
<p>I think that this country certainly,</p>
<p>and a lot of the world is desperate</p>
<p>for certain kinds of leaders and people to have experience</p>
<p>in high risk, high consequence, chaotic situations,</p>
<p>and have shown prowess at leadership in multiple domains.</p>
<p>And you are certainly one of those individuals.</p>
<p>And so they ask for that reason among others.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve heard you give your answer.</p>
<p>You can repeat it again here,</p>
<p>but as a more broad theme</p>
<p>that I think people are interested in,</p>
<p>do you think it&rsquo;s an important criteria</p>
<p>or it would be great to see people</p>
<p>in positions of leadership who&rsquo;ve had wartime experience?</p>
<p>And do you think that some of the shifts that we&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>in terms of patterns of leadership over the last,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just make it real broad</p>
<p>so that this isn&rsquo;t related to any particular person</p>
<p>or stretch of history,</p>
<p>but over the last, let&rsquo;s just say 25 years,</p>
<p>reflect the fact that we haven&rsquo;t seen a lot of that,</p>
<p>at least at the top tiers of leadership?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;d be excellent if people,</p>
<p>if the president had military experience, for sure.</p>
<p>I think that then they understand</p>
<p>with the way the military works better.</p>
<p>They understand that it&rsquo;s civilians</p>
<p>that control the military,</p>
<p>because a lot of times people that are civilians</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t understand that the civilians control the military.</p>
<p>And I think that you do get to appreciate</p>
<p>what war actually is and what the costs are.</p>
<p>I think that I&rsquo;ve seen in the same vein</p>
<p>of people asking me to run for political office,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen comments saying,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s what we need, a warmonger in office.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve responded to a few of those.</p>
<p>I think if there&rsquo;s any group of people</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t want war, it&rsquo;s people that have seen it,</p>
<p>people that understand what the sacrifices are.</p>
<p>And I think that being in the military,</p>
<p>people understand that better.</p>
<p>So yeah, I think it&rsquo;d be a great qualification.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s mandatory.</p>
<p>I mean, clearly it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had a bunch of presidents</p>
<p>that haven&rsquo;t ever served anything.</p>
<p>Really, we&rsquo;ve had a bunch of presidents</p>
<p>that haven&rsquo;t ever served anything but themselves.</p>
<p>So yeah, hopefully we&rsquo;ll get some more people</p>
<p>that have some experience in the military,</p>
<p>some combat experience would be especially nice.</p>
<p>And that would be good, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m certainly not one to tell people what to do,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m certainly not gonna tell you what to do,</p>
<p>but should you ever choose to run,</p>
<p>I would certainly be very enthusiastic about that.</p>
<p>And I will just say that with that stated,</p>
<p>I hope people do hear what you just said.</p>
<p>I share that sentiment.</p>
<p>People who have led others besides themselves,</p>
<p>I think is the key statement there.</p>
<p>Yeah, and look, I just,</p>
<p>I have friends that are politicians,</p>
<p>and I really appreciate what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And it looks miserable to me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like what I, good for them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy that they&rsquo;re in there</p>
<p>trying to make a difference.</p>
<p>And I guess this is me being selfish</p>
<p>of me saying, look, I don&rsquo;t think I could stomach that.</p>
<p>And I also think that right now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to help out.</p>
<p>Like for instance, we have,</p>
<p>obviously you&rsquo;ve got the leadership consulting</p>
<p>and national on front.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to help businesses grow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got Origin USA,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re bringing manufacturing back to America.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got 400 and 450 employees right now</p>
<p>that are here in America,</p>
<p>working and growing that business.</p>
<p>Obviously the supplements.</p>
<p>So everything that I&rsquo;m doing here right now</p>
<p>is to try and move the needle</p>
<p>with America bringing manufacturing back,</p>
<p>helping the economy as much as I can right now.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of what I&rsquo;m doing right now.</p>
<p>And my standard answer,</p>
<p>which you alluded to is if things got bad enough,</p>
<p>then I would do what I had to do.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think people appreciate my level of bad,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking real bad.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not there yet</p>
<p>and hopefully it never will get there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather surf and hang out with my friends</p>
<p>and hang out with my family than do that.</p>
<p>And hopefully America can find some level of balance.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the problem that we&rsquo;re having right now.</p>
<p>And a lot of these things that you talked about,</p>
<p>specifically the thing you talk about with social media</p>
<p>is not very good for political balance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually horrible for political balance.</p>
<p>And a lot of it has to do with</p>
<p>just the way that those conversations are had.</p>
<p>A lot of it has to do with ego as well,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t ever want to admit</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m wrong about anything.</p>
<p>And if I can find something</p>
<p>that I think you might be wrong about,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so satisfying to my ego</p>
<p>to just call you out on that thing and attack you.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what a lot of people are doing right now.</p>
<p>Now, that being said also,</p>
<p>I also usually say this as well.</p>
<p>I travel around the country all the time.</p>
<p>I work with companies of all sizes,</p>
<p>work with people in every different industry,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not sitting around arguing with each other</p>
<p>about the political scenery.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re talking about, hey, how can we grow our business?</p>
<p>How can we take care of our workers?</p>
<p>How can we take care of our clients?</p>
<p>How can we take care of our customer?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what people are focused on.</p>
<p>And when you jump on social media,</p>
<p>you can get sucked into the political scene very easily.</p>
<p>And that being said also, we do have to pay attention</p>
<p>because we as citizens have to make sure</p>
<p>that America stays on the correct path</p>
<p>within the guardrails of what this country is based on.</p>
<p>So we do have to pay attention,</p>
<p>but I will be doing my part as a civilian</p>
<p>until there&rsquo;s total mayhem and chaos in the streets.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;ll probably just be a benevolent dictator</p>
<p>that takes over.</p>
<p>It should be an interesting one,</p>
<p>but hey, you would be the man to lead under any conditions.</p>
<p>But thank you for stating your threshold.</p>
<p>Certainly you&rsquo;ve earned the right to make</p>
<p>whatever decision is that feels right for you.</p>
<p>And I want to say that I agree.</p>
<p>I feel like we are a country that still includes</p>
<p>a ton of generators and a ton of projectors</p>
<p>that are interested in projecting the good</p>
<p>and growing the good.</p>
<p>I do believe both those phenotypes are important.</p>
<p>I also want to just say thank you for being a generator</p>
<p>of so much useful knowledge.</p>
<p>In science, we have a saying,</p>
<p>which is somebody is an N of one.</p>
<p>This is a rare thing to hear about oneself</p>
<p>or to hear about somebody,</p>
<p>because what it means is that somebody is in a category</p>
<p>in which pretty much everything that they do</p>
<p>and they say matters and serves a purpose,</p>
<p>which is a useful and important building purpose.</p>
<p>And I will look at you and tell you</p>
<p>that you are an N of one.</p>
<p>You certainly would meet that criteria under any conditions.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s evident in the many companies that you&rsquo;re running</p>
<p>and the leadership that you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>and also in your online presence.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s how I initially came to learn about you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now fortunate to have two lengthy conversations with you</p>
<p>and a few interspersed as well.</p>
<p>And I think of myself as a reasonable</p>
<p>to perhaps good observer</p>
<p>of like how people behave in different domains.</p>
<p>And every time you post or every time you speak</p>
<p>or every time you go on a podcast or host a podcast,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s clear that not only are you prepared</p>
<p>and not only are you approaching it</p>
<p>with a spirit of seriousness that it deserves,</p>
<p>but sometimes also lightness that it deserves,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s always an element of give</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re trying to encourage people</p>
<p>to do better for themselves.</p>
<p>So as somebody who&rsquo;s greatly benefited from the knowledge</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve put out there</p>
<p>from the very first Tim Ferriss and Joe Rogan episodes</p>
<p>to your own podcast, I want to extend a personal thanks.</p>
<p>I also want to extend great thanks for coming on here today</p>
<p>talking to a geek scientist,</p>
<p>but who also happens to be a fellow punk rocker</p>
<p>because that spirit and the heart that&rsquo;s behind it,</p>
<p>I think some people think it&rsquo;s all about noise and chaos.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually about being really true to yourself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I think about the punk rock spirit</p>
<p>is really about being true to yourself</p>
<p>and realizing that the thing that you like,</p>
<p>while it might be quite different,</p>
<p>is actually if that&rsquo;s you,</p>
<p>you have to live in that vein and stick with it.</p>
<p>It certainly served me well</p>
<p>and it sounds like it served you well,</p>
<p>but mostly I just want to extend an enormous thank you.</p>
<p>As a civilian, thank you for the work you did</p>
<p>in the military,</p>
<p>but also teaching people about the military.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s about at any level</p>
<p>and learning about your experience there</p>
<p>and what you&rsquo;ve observed,</p>
<p>bringing other people&rsquo;s experiences from the military</p>
<p>more broadly is super important</p>
<p>and sharing this and being able to entertain</p>
<p>some of my scientific riffs.</p>
<p>So thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Well, I appreciate it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of weird.</p>
<p>You say all these nice things to me.</p>
<p>I definitely don&rsquo;t deserve them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of a regular dude that just kind of showed up,</p>
<p>I guess, at the right time</p>
<p>and told some stories about some guys that were true heroes</p>
<p>and just trying to share my perspective,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not just my perspective.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m talking about stories that I lived,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s plenty of people that have done way more</p>
<p>than I&rsquo;ve ever done</p>
<p>and sacrificed infinitely more than I ever sacrificed.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m thankful for being here.</p>
<p>I know that you put all kinds of information</p>
<p>and I the same back at you.</p>
<p>You know, I have greatly benefited from the information</p>
<p>that you put out and so I thank you as well</p>
<p>and appreciate coming on here</p>
<p>and appreciate you spreading the word</p>
<p>about how people can be better yourself.</p>
<p>So thanks for having me.</p>
<p>I appreciate it, man.</p>
<p>Appreciate you and appreciate this time</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s do it again.</p>

<p>we are Huberman Lab on Instagram, Twitter,</p>
<p>Facebook and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>And in particular on Instagram,</p>
<p>I cover science and science-related tools,</p>
<p>some of which overlap with the contents</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>much of which is distinct, however,</p>
<p>from the contents of the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.</p>
<p>And if you haven&rsquo;t already subscribed</p>
<p>to our Neural Network newsletter,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a zero cost monthly newsletter.</p>
<p>You simply sign up with your email</p>
<p>by going to HubermanLab.com.</p>
<p>The newsletter includes summaries of podcast episodes.</p>
<p>We have toolkits for sleep, toolkits for focus,</p>
<p>toolkits related to deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>heat exposure, and much, much more.</p>
<p>Again, all zero cost.</p>
<p>You provide your email to sign up.</p>
<p>We do not share your email with anybody.</p>
<p>There are also sample newsletters there</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t even need to sign up for.</p>
<p>You can just download the PDF or just view them</p>
<p>on your computer or phone screen.</p>
<p>Thank you once again for joining me</p>
<p>for my discussion with Jocko Willink.</p>
<p>And as always, thank you for your interest in science.</p>
