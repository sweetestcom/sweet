I don&amp;rsquo;t just disagree with it.
I don&amp;rsquo;t just think it&amp;rsquo;s against the 14th Amendment.
I hate it.
The hatred comes from an understanding
that it is a bandaid, that it is a substitute
for the actual development of the capacities
of our people to compete.
They wanna tell African Americans to pat us on the head.
We&amp;rsquo;re gonna have a separate program for you.

    <p>I hate affirmative action.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t just disagree with it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t just think it&rsquo;s against the 14th Amendment.</p>
<p>I hate it.</p>
<p>The hatred comes from an understanding</p>
<p>that it is a bandaid, that it is a substitute</p>
<p>for the actual development of the capacities</p>
<p>of our people to compete.</p>
<p>They wanna tell African Americans to pat us on the head.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna have a separate program for you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna give you a side door that you can come into.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t make us any smarter.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make us any more creative</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t make us any more fit</p>
<p>for the actual competition that&rsquo;s unfolding before us.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Glenn Loury,</p>
<p>professor of economics and social sciences</p>
<p>at Brown University.</p>
<p>He is one of the great minds and communicators of our time,</p>
<p>writing and speaking about race and inequality.</p>
<p>I highly encourage you to listen to his show</p>
<p>on YouTube and Substack, simply called The Glenn Show.</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Glenn Loury.</p>
<p>Martin Luther King Jr.&rsquo;s I Have a Dream speech</p>
<p>I think is the greatest speech in American history.</p>
<p>If I may, I&rsquo;d like to read a few words of it.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And ask you a question about this dream.</p>
<p>I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up</p>
<p>and live out the true meaning of its creed.</p>
<p>We hold these truths to be self evident,</p>
<p>that all men are created equal.</p>
<p>I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia,</p>
<p>the sons of former slaves and the sons of former</p>
<p>slave owners will be able to sit down together</p>
<p>at the table of brotherhood.</p>
<p>I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi,</p>
<p>a state sweltering with the heat of injustice,</p>
<p>sweltering with the heat of oppression,</p>
<p>will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.</p>
<p>I have a dream that my four little children</p>
<p>will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged</p>
<p>by the color of their skin,</p>
<p>but by the content of their character.</p>
<p>I have a dream today.</p>
<p>First of all, damn.</p>
<p>I mentioned to you offline I immigrated to America</p>
<p>and this is why I love this country.</p>
<p>This is one of the great speeches that represents</p>
<p>what this country is about.</p>
<p>So what is this ideal of equality</p>
<p>that we should strive for as a nation,</p>
<p>that all men are created equal?</p>
<p>What does that mean to you, this equality?</p>
<p>Well, if we put this in historical context,</p>
<p>King is speaking in 1963 when he gives that speech.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exactly 100 years after Abraham Lincoln signs</p>
<p>the Emancipation Proclamation</p>
<p>declaring the enslaved people to be free.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not yet citizens in 1863,</p>
<p>but the end of slavery has become the position</p>
<p>of the federal government when Lincoln issues</p>
<p>that Emancipation Proclamation.</p>
<p>So putting it in context, enslaved people,</p>
<p>four million or so African descended enslaved people,</p>
<p>how do they become citizens?</p>
<p>How do they become in this status of subjugation</p>
<p>and domination and stigma and exclusion?</p>
<p>How do they become citizens?</p>
<p>It seems to me that that&rsquo;s the heart of it.</p>
<p>The equality that King is talking about</p>
<p>is an equality of status as members of the nation</p>
<p>as free and equal citizens within the republic.</p>
<p>Now, I think it&rsquo;s really important to understand</p>
<p>that slavery was not merely a legal order,</p>
<p>but it was also a social system</p>
<p>that had the symbolism attached to it.</p>
<p>They had a big journey to make</p>
<p>from their subjugated status as serfs, as landless people,</p>
<p>as uneducated, unfit for citizenship really</p>
<p>in the minds of many.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s what in 1963, 100 years later,</p>
<p>that King is appealing to this idea</p>
<p>that when Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence</p>
<p>writes these words, all men are created equal</p>
<p>and endowed by their creator</p>
<p>with certain inalienable rights,</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson, a slave owner, didn&rsquo;t have in mind</p>
<p>when he wrote those words, the people who were slaves.</p>
<p>But by the time you get to 1963,</p>
<p>King is invoking this idea, all men,</p>
<p>and of course he means all persons.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t only mean men.</p>
<p>He means men and women are created equal.</p>
<p>He wants this idea to be embraced by the country</p>
<p>in reference to the descendants of the African slaves.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s his dream.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s his idea.</p>
<p>The legacy of slavery would be erased,</p>
<p>that the position of African Americans would be equalized</p>
<p>within the political community,</p>
<p>which is the United States of America.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my sense of it in any case.</p>
<p>So on a very basic level, the worth of a human being</p>
<p>is equal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just literally the worth of a human being.</p>
<p>So I mentioned to you offline</p>
<p>that I came from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>My grandfather fought in World War II,</p>
<p>and for Hitler, the worth of a Slavic person</p>
<p>as they were captured, there&rsquo;s different numbers,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s in the hundreds to one German</p>
<p>in terms of the value of the person to the great Germany.</p>
<p>So he wanted Germany to expand</p>
<p>and conquer a large part of the world.</p>
<p>And within that future world, that Third Reich,</p>
<p>the worth of a Russian or a Slavic person</p>
<p>is one hundredth or one thousandth of a German person,</p>
<p>of a pure German person.</p>
<p>So that has to do with not some kind of public policy</p>
<p>or politics or all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>It has to do with the basic worth of a human being.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what Dr. King is speaking to,</p>
<p>that all people on some kind of deep level</p>
<p>are worth the same.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somehow weighing the value of a person,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re equal in that basic fundamental worth.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s very well said.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that he had in mind</p>
<p>the position of Slavic people in Central Europe</p>
<p>in the middle of the 20th century,</p>
<p>or the first part of the 20th century, King.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that he had that in mind.</p>
<p>He might well have done.</p>
<p>But certainly that&rsquo;s the idea.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t think he was really thinking</p>
<p>about this particular civil rights struggle</p>
<p>and the particular struggle</p>
<p>against the backdrop of the history of slavery in America</p>
<p>and thinking about African Americans.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t thinking about the basic,</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t speaking to the basic worth of all human beings.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t mean to say that.</p>
<p>The speech in Washington.</p>
<p>The dream.</p>
<p>In 1963 at that march was within the context</p>
<p>of the United States.</p>
<p>And it was within the context of the civil rights movement.</p>
<p>There was a movement that was going on.</p>
<p>He was an actor in a political drama that was American</p>
<p>that had to do with the fight over equal rights</p>
<p>for voting, for housing, for employment,</p>
<p>for citizenship of blacks in America.</p>
<p>But King was informed, I think,</p>
<p>by a much broader Christian ethic of the equality</p>
<p>of all persons.</p>
<p>I mean, he gets killed in 1968.</p>
<p>The five years after that speech in Washington,</p>
<p>he spends developing his worldview</p>
<p>and the things that he had to say, for example,</p>
<p>about the war in Southeast Asia that was going on</p>
<p>at that time made appeals to universal principles</p>
<p>of equality.</p>
<p>He was a pacifist to some degree.</p>
<p>He was against war.</p>
<p>He was a socialist to some degree.</p>
<p>He might not have worn that label publicly,</p>
<p>but he believed in a decent society</p>
<p>where the poor would not go untended,</p>
<p>where healthcare would be available to people who needed it</p>
<p>and this kind of thing.</p>
<p>A humanitarian who saw that the value of a life</p>
<p>was not dependent upon the color of the skin,</p>
<p>upon the native mother tongue that might be spoken,</p>
<p>upon whether male or female.</p>
<p>All persons are created equal.</p>
<p>This is very much the ethic of Martin Luther King,</p>
<p>on my understanding.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, what do you learn about human nature</p>
<p>by looking at the history of slavery in America?</p>
<p>Oh my.</p>
<p>So what does that tell you about people?</p>
<p>Well, I think of two things right off the top of my head.</p>
<p>One is about the capacity of people</p>
<p>for looking the other way in the face of</p>
<p>unethical and morally profoundly problematic practice.</p>
<p>So, I mean, slavery was controversial.</p>
<p>It was controversial going all the way back</p>
<p>to the founding of the United States of America.</p>
<p>The country was founded on a compromise</p>
<p>where half of the country thought that slavery was abhorrent</p>
<p>and would not have had it countenanced in the Constitution.</p>
<p>The other half of the country were steeped</p>
<p>in the dependence on the labor of these African captives</p>
<p>and their descendants.</p>
<p>The economy depended upon it.</p>
<p>They owned them as property.</p>
<p>That was their wealth.</p>
<p>Their wealth was invested to some degree</p>
<p>in the value of these human beings.</p>
<p>And in order for the United States to come together</p>
<p>as a confederation of the several colonies,</p>
<p>there had to be a compromise made.</p>
<p>And it was made where slavery was allowed to persist</p>
<p>and the people who were against it</p>
<p>or who thought it morally problematic</p>
<p>were able to countenance the practice</p>
<p>in the Southern states where slavery flourished.</p>
<p>And that went on for 75 years</p>
<p>after the founding of the country</p>
<p>until the crisis of the late 1850s</p>
<p>that led to the Civil War</p>
<p>and ultimately to the emancipation.</p>
<p>So one thing I think about human nature</p>
<p>from the fact of slavery is that the ability of people</p>
<p>to live with terrible, morally questionable practices</p>
<p>and have that as a part of their institutions.</p>
<p>It took a movement, a massive movement of abolitionists</p>
<p>struggling against slavery for the better part of a century</p>
<p>before that practice could be eradicated.</p>
<p>But the other thing about human nature that I see</p>
<p>is the ability of people to sustain their humanity</p>
<p>under the most awful, oppressive conditions.</p>
<p>The enslaved persons, the slaves and their children,</p>
<p>I mean, they were chattel,</p>
<p>they were bought and sold like horses or cattle.</p>
<p>And yet their humanity was not destroyed by that.</p>
<p>And they were able to sustain their dignity to some degree</p>
<p>in such a manner that once emancipation finally did arrive,</p>
<p>the freedmen and women, the persons who had been enslaved</p>
<p>and who were set free were able to over the following decades</p>
<p>build a foundation for the development of African Americans</p>
<p>within the context of American society</p>
<p>that eventually culminated in the civil rights movement</p>
<p>of the middle of the 20th century</p>
<p>and has led us into the present day.</p>
<p>So, you know, human nature can countenance awful evil</p>
<p>but human nature can also survive</p>
<p>in the face of terrible evil.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I take from slavery.</p>
<p>That survival, that flame can burn even when the world</p>
<p>around it tries to put it out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a little flame of human consciousness,</p>
<p>of spirit, of culture, of whatever the hell that is</p>
<p>that makes humans flourish and makes humans beautiful</p>
<p>that lives on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very well said.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think you put it very well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gotta be some poetic way of expressing that.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Leave it to the poets.</p>
<p>What about the people that look the other way?</p>
<p>How many people do you think, just regular people,</p>
<p>knew that something is, this is wrong?</p>
<p>Or do people through generations convince themselves,</p>
<p>most people, most regular people,</p>
<p>convince themselves that there&rsquo;s nothing wrong?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I ask this question because I wonder</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re looking the other way on today also.</p>
<p>Because you have to ask yourself these difficult questions</p>
<p>of assuming we&rsquo;re the same people we were back then</p>
<p>then we can be flawed in that same kind of way.</p>
<p>We can look the other way just as others have in history.</p>
<p>Yeah, you spoke of the European context</p>
<p>and of the Nazis and certainly a lot of people</p>
<p>had to be looking the other way when the massive crimes</p>
<p>that were committed by that regime were being undertaken.</p>
<p>I mean, railroad cars full of human beings</p>
<p>being taken off to be slaughtered or to be worked to death</p>
<p>in labor camps or to be gassed, et cetera.</p>
<p>A lot of people had to know about what was going on</p>
<p>and look the other way or enthusiastically supported</p>
<p>the persecution of the Jews and the gypsies and so on.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, I wasn&rsquo;t around in 1840.</p>
<p>My sense of the matter is that like many practices</p>
<p>that are unjust, most people thought</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just the way it is.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the world that they inherited.</p>
<p>They were not moralists, they were not revolutionaries.</p>
<p>They just wanted to go along.</p>
<p>Some people might&rsquo;ve been troubled by it</p>
<p>but thought there&rsquo;s nothing that can be done.</p>
<p>Some people might&rsquo;ve thought, well,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re these black Africans, they&rsquo;re not really like us</p>
<p>and they are lucky to be here.</p>
<p>If they were in Africa, they&rsquo;d be worse off still.</p>
<p>Some people might&rsquo;ve thought that.</p>
<p>Some people might&rsquo;ve been disturbed</p>
<p>but not been able to see what it is</p>
<p>that they could do about it.</p>
<p>They might&rsquo;ve thought, oh, this is disgusting.</p>
<p>This is not something I would wanna have anything to do with</p>
<p>but not knowing whether there&rsquo;s any practical way</p>
<p>of opposing it, that&rsquo;s why you need a movement.</p>
<p>You need for the people who are troubled by the practice</p>
<p>to know that there are others like themselves</p>
<p>equally troubled and as they gather together,</p>
<p>collectively, they can exert their influence.</p>
<p>I mean, debates about the wrongness of slavery,</p>
<p>as I say, go all the way back to the founding of the country.</p>
<p>There were abolitionists and there were people</p>
<p>who opposed the compromise that led to the framing documents</p>
<p>and institutions that created the United States of America,</p>
<p>opposed the countenancing of slavery in that situation.</p>
<p>But it took a while before that could come to a head</p>
<p>and produce the crisis which ultimately led</p>
<p>to the eradication of slavery.</p>
<p>I would note that slavery is not unique to the United States.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not unique to the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>The enslavement of people, the trafficking in human chattel</p>
<p>is something that one sees on a global basis,</p>
<p>one sees it going all the way back to antiquity.</p>
<p>So we might ask, how is it that people finally came</p>
<p>to turn their backs and eradicate the practice?</p>
<p>That might be the thing worth really trying to understand</p>
<p>because the practice itself is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a wonderful book by the sociologist</p>
<p>Orlando Patterson called Slavery and Social Death</p>
<p>that was published in 1982, which is a comprehensive history</p>
<p>and social analysis of the institution of slavery</p>
<p>over 2,500 years, going back to the classical Greek</p>
<p>and Roman civilizations, finding slavery in Africa</p>
<p>amongst Africans, finding slavery in the Middle East,</p>
<p>finding slavery in the Far East,</p>
<p>finding slavery in South Asia, the enslavement of people,</p>
<p>the practice of taking someone as a captive in war</p>
<p>and then instead of killing them, which you could do,</p>
<p>making them into your property was very, very widespread</p>
<p>in human culture.</p>
<p>So I mean, I&rsquo;d like to make this point sometimes</p>
<p>when people are talking about how wrong slavery was</p>
<p>and I agree without any question</p>
<p>that the practice was profoundly morally problematic,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d like to make the point that given how wrong it was,</p>
<p>think about how impressive was the accomplishment</p>
<p>of the eradication of slavery.</p>
<p>Now, that was something, I mean, there were 600,000 dead</p>
<p>in the war between the states, 1861 to 1865</p>
<p>in a country of 30 million people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of dead people who gave their lives</p>
<p>not to eradicate slavery in every instance,</p>
<p>probably most of them were just fighting for,</p>
<p>they enlisted or were conscripted into the forces</p>
<p>and they fought and they died,</p>
<p>but the net effect of their having fought and died</p>
<p>was to push along a process</p>
<p>that led to the eradication of slavery.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an amazing achievement.</p>
<p>The slaves themselves were largely uneducated</p>
<p>and backward in their,</p>
<p>of course, what else could they have been?</p>
<p>They were kept in captivity,</p>
<p>they were prevented from developing their human potential</p>
<p>and yet after the end of slavery,</p>
<p>that population, that 4 million plus African descended people</p>
<p>became the foundation for what a century later</p>
<p>leads to Martin Luther King standing in the Washington Mall</p>
<p>and giving that great speech</p>
<p>and now here we are 150 years down the road</p>
<p>and Barack Obama is president of the United States.</p>
<p>Now, he did not descend from slaves,</p>
<p>I think we must not lose track of that,</p>
<p>but he identified as an African American</p>
<p>and was a part of the population</p>
<p>that consisted largely of people who descended from slaves</p>
<p>and we are, we African Americans are</p>
<p>for all practical purposes,</p>
<p>fully equal citizens of this great republic.</p>
<p>That has happened within a century and a half</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know that you can find any parallel</p>
<p>to that kind of transformation in the status of people</p>
<p>from human chattel to full citizens of the republic.</p>
<p>Anywhere in human history,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s certainly worth celebrating the achievement</p>
<p>of the eradication of slavery, I would say.</p>
<p>And it probably started with a few people</p>
<p>that inside their mind dared to rebel.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s interesting to think about how it all started,</p>
<p>how in the state of injustice,</p>
<p>the revolution percolates, like where it starts.</p>
<p>You said people that see something is wrong find each other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the ideas of charismatic individuals</p>
<p>that not only know that something is wrong,</p>
<p>but are able to tell others about it and be convincing</p>
<p>and then together gather and rise up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to make this kind of incredible progress</p>
<p>from slavery to where we are today</p>
<p>to live out the ideal of this all men are created equal.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The power of individual,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know what you think about it,</p>
<p>but I tend to think that a few small individuals</p>
<p>probably originated this.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s the power of the individual,</p>
<p>because sometimes we think there&rsquo;s injustice in the world,</p>
<p>what can I possibly do?</p>
<p>But I tend to think one person can be the seed</p>
<p>of starting to fix the injustice.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>One person here, one person there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>One thinks of course of Frederick Douglass,</p>
<p>this massively significant figure who was born in slavery,</p>
<p>who stole his freedom because he was property</p>
<p>and he decided he was not gonna be property anymore</p>
<p>and he took it unto himself to emancipate himself personally</p>
<p>and who became an educated, a powerfully articulate,</p>
<p>massively influential person in the United States</p>
<p>and in England going around presenting himself</p>
<p>as an embodiment of human dignity</p>
<p>and commitment to ideals of equality.</p>
<p>And I mean, he&rsquo;s just one person,</p>
<p>but there were others like him.</p>
<p>Just one person.</p>
<p>All it takes is just one person.</p>
<p>So here we are on this topic of equality</p>
<p>in the 21st century.</p>
<p>So what does equality mean today?</p>
<p>If you start to think about this idea of equality of outcome</p>
<p>or the injustice of inequality,</p>
<p>at which point does equality of outcome is just,</p>
<p>at which point is it unjust?</p>
<p>Sort of looking at our world today</p>
<p>and looking at inequality,</p>
<p>how do we know that some inequality is a sign of injustice</p>
<p>and some is the way of life?</p>
<p>So what does equality mean when we look at the world today,</p>
<p>different from Dr. King&rsquo;s speech of the basic humanity?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think King&rsquo;s speech, I have a dream</p>
<p>that one day my four little children will be judged</p>
<p>not by the color of their skin,</p>
<p>but by the content of their character</p>
<p>requires equality of outcome.</p>
<p>He says his children will be judged</p>
<p>by the content of their character.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a conditional statement.</p>
<p>That is the judgment will depend upon the content</p>
<p>of their character, not the color of their skin,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t follow from that,</p>
<p>that the outcomes, whatever outcomes we consider wealth</p>
<p>and economic power,</p>
<p>position within the society,</p>
<p>representation in the various professions,</p>
<p>the various measures of social achievement</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t follow from judging by the content of character</p>
<p>and not color of skin,</p>
<p>that when we look at the end of the day</p>
<p>at the social outcomes that they will be equal</p>
<p>across the different groups.</p>
<p>In fact, I think there&rsquo;s a contradiction in the idea</p>
<p>that groups will be equal</p>
<p>in all of the various social outcomes,</p>
<p>that they will be equally successful in business,</p>
<p>that they will be proportionately represented</p>
<p>in the various professions,</p>
<p>that they will have the same educational achievement,</p>
<p>that the occupational profiles will look the same.</p>
<p>If they are, in fact, distinct groups</p>
<p>with their own cultural traditions and practices,</p>
<p>with their own ideals and norms,</p>
<p>various immigrant populations,</p>
<p>people coming to the United States of America</p>
<p>from all corners of the world,</p>
<p>the descendants of the African slaves,</p>
<p>the black Americans here today,</p>
<p>who are ourselves various with different backgrounds,</p>
<p>different origins and so on,</p>
<p>the different religious practices and commitments</p>
<p>that Jewish or Mormon or Christian or whatever,</p>
<p>however we parcel up the total population</p>
<p>into the various groups,</p>
<p>these groups are themselves different from one another.</p>
<p>They have different norms</p>
<p>within their own cultural practice.</p>
<p>How would we expect,</p>
<p>if in fact we recognize</p>
<p>that the groups are different from one another,</p>
<p>that in a world that is fair,</p>
<p>they would all come out equally represented</p>
<p>in every undertaking.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not equally represented,</p>
<p>and that fact, I&rsquo;m arguing,</p>
<p>is in and of itself insufficient</p>
<p>to justify the conclusion</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not somehow being fairly treated.</p>
<p>Fair treatment doesn&rsquo;t imply equal outcomes</p>
<p>in a world in which the populations in question</p>
<p>are themselves different</p>
<p>with respect to their culture, their practices,</p>
<p>their norms, their traditions,</p>
<p>their beliefs, their ideals, and so on.</p>
<p>The fact of those different norms, traditions, beliefs,</p>
<p>cultural orientations, and ideals</p>
<p>will have consequences</p>
<p>in terms of their different social outcomes.</p>
<p>So I just think it&rsquo;s a mistake</p>
<p>that people are making</p>
<p>when they think</p>
<p>fairness of treatment</p>
<p>implies equality of outcomes.</p>
<p>It does not.</p>
<p>Is the process by which we&rsquo;re speaking now</p>
<p>in the midst of the National Basketball Association&rsquo;s</p>
<p>playoffs,</p>
<p>I confess to being a Boston Celtics fan.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very good team, and I&rsquo;m excited about my Celtics.</p>
<p>We defeated</p>
<p>the Brooklyn</p>
<p>Nets.</p>
<p>I mean, we defeated Kevin Durant</p>
<p>and Kyrie Irving and company, okay,</p>
<p>in a playoff series.</p>
<p>We whipped them,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re on our way to</p>
<p>the Eastern Conference Finals,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re on our way to the NBA Finals,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m, you know, if I were a betting man,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d put down a few bucks</p>
<p>that the Boston Celtics, underrated as we are,</p>
<p>have a very good chance of winning the NBA Finals.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s the NBA.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the National Basketball Association.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a sports fan.</p>
<p>I like basketball.</p>
<p>Slightly biased prediction, but yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is somewhat biased.</p>
<p>All I&rsquo;m saying is,</p>
<p>if you take a look at who the star players are</p>
<p>in the National Basketball Association,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna find that there&rsquo;s some Eastern Europeans.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s some really good basketball players</p>
<p>coming out of Eastern Europe,</p>
<p>and more power to them,</p>
<p>and there are a lot of African Americans.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re overrepresented.</p>
<p>There are not that many Jews, as far as I know.</p>
<p>No offense intended there, Lex,</p>
<p>but I mean,</p>
<p>the NBA is not</p>
<p>equally representative</p>
<p>of all of the different populations in the United States.</p>
<p>Now, we could go into the reasons why,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just saying the process</p>
<p>by which you get to be playing in the NBA is fair.</p>
<p>If you can play, you can get on the court.</p>
<p>All they&rsquo;re looking for is people who can play.</p>
<p>I think something like that is true</p>
<p>in many different venues.</p>
<p>I expect, if you&rsquo;re a really good technical engineer,</p>
<p>companies are gonna employ you,</p>
<p>and if you can make money, they&rsquo;re gonna advance you,</p>
<p>and you will be able to rise to the top of that profession.</p>
<p>I expect that the people who are engaged</p>
<p>in financial transactions,</p>
<p>who are actually making bets on the market,</p>
<p>by and large, are the people who are good at that activity,</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re good at that activity in this world,</p>
<p>in this modern world,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna rise to the top.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that there are no barriers of discrimination.</p>
<p>Of course, there are of many different sorts,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m saying that to expect that there would be,</p>
<p>okay, I mean, let&rsquo;s look at who&rsquo;s actually writing code.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at who&rsquo;s actually trading bonds.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at who&rsquo;s actually starting businesses and so on.</p>
<p>To say that in a fair world,</p>
<p>I would expect that if blacks are 10% of the population,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d be 10% of every one of those things,</p>
<p>is to ignore the reality that the differences</p>
<p>in the culture and practices and norms</p>
<p>of the various population groups</p>
<p>will lead to differences in their representation</p>
<p>amongst people who are outstanding performers</p>
<p>in one or another activity.</p>
<p>How do you know if the difference in culture</p>
<p>accounts for the difference in outcomes,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s the existence of barriers,</p>
<p>especially barriers early on in life,</p>
<p>of discrimination that are racially based?</p>
<p>So if you think about affirmative action,</p>
<p>in which ways is affirmative action empowering,</p>
<p>in which way is it limiting</p>
<p>for these early development of different groups,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s just speak to African Americans.</p>
<p>We should say that you went to some no name</p>
<p>Northwestern University at first,</p>
<p>but then you ended up with the great university of MIT.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s your, not early, but middle development.</p>
<p>So speaking of the development,</p>
<p>the opportunities, the equality of opportunity,</p>
<p>how do we know we got that equality right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m glad you put it like that.</p>
<p>We were talking about results,</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re talking about opportunity.</p>
<p>I was taking the position that</p>
<p>when King says, I have a dream and he envisions a world</p>
<p>where his children will not be barred</p>
<p>from the good things in life</p>
<p>because of the color of their skin,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about opportunity, not about results.</p>
<p>But opportunity is not just something</p>
<p>that depends upon what the law is</p>
<p>and what public policies are.</p>
<p>Opportunity also depends upon the social conditions</p>
<p>in which people are raised,</p>
<p>the social and economic conditions.</p>
<p>So the child of a poor family that has no resources,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have the same opportunity</p>
<p>as a child of a wealthy family</p>
<p>to realize their full human potential.</p>
<p>You asked me, how can we tell whether or not</p>
<p>a difference in outcomes is a reflection</p>
<p>of unequal opportunity,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s a reflection of differences in culture</p>
<p>and interest and practice?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s a single answer</p>
<p>to that question,</p>
<p>but I think one wants to look at the data,</p>
<p>one wants to try to measure.</p>
<p>As a social scientist, I would say what you wanna do</p>
<p>is you wanna estimate the significance of various factors</p>
<p>for determining the outcome.</p>
<p>If the outcome is how much money does a person make</p>
<p>when they work in the labor market?</p>
<p>So you look at their wages and you think,</p>
<p>well, that depends upon a number of things.</p>
<p>It depends upon how educated they are,</p>
<p>what kind of skills they have,</p>
<p>what kind of work experience they have, and so on.</p>
<p>And those things are all legitimate factors</p>
<p>that might determine how much they end up making</p>
<p>in the labor market.</p>
<p>But you also wanna perhaps, controlling for those things,</p>
<p>see whether or not the fact that they are black</p>
<p>or they are Latino or whatever,</p>
<p>fact that they are male or that they are female,</p>
<p>the fact that they do or do not speak English</p>
<p>as their native language, this kind of thing,</p>
<p>whether those factors also are implicated</p>
<p>in determining how successful they are in the labor market.</p>
<p>And if you find that after you have controlled</p>
<p>for the things that are legitimately determining success</p>
<p>and failure in the labor market,</p>
<p>like skills and education and experience,</p>
<p>having controlled for those things,</p>
<p>the fact that a person is black or is a woman</p>
<p>or is an immigrant or is of Latino background</p>
<p>also affects their earnings,</p>
<p>then you might conclude that to that extent,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not getting equal opportunity in the labor market,</p>
<p>that kind of idea.</p>
<p>But I wanna focus a little bit more here</p>
<p>on what we mean by opportunity</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not just whether employers treat the worker</p>
<p>on a fair and even basis,</p>
<p>irregardless of the worker&rsquo;s racial or ethnic background.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one opportunity issue,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s at the end of the development process.</p>
<p>They are now presenting themselves to the market,</p>
<p>trying to find work and being employed at this or that wage.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the end of the line.</p>
<p>What about the developmental opportunity,</p>
<p>the opportunity to acquire skills in the first place?</p>
<p>That goes all the way back,</p>
<p>that goes all the way back to birth.</p>
<p>It even goes back to before birth.</p>
<p>Or the mother carrying the infant in the womb,</p>
<p>she has certain nutritional practices</p>
<p>as she might be smoking or drinking alcohol</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying she is, I&rsquo;m not saying she isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying whether she is or she isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that will affect the development of the fetus.</p>
<p>The newborn, now there&rsquo;s a question of environment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a question of the development</p>
<p>of their neurological potential.</p>
<p>Do they learn how to read?</p>
<p>Are they stimulated verbally?</p>
<p>How many words have they heard spoken?</p>
<p>Are they being nurtured in a home environment</p>
<p>so as to maximize the possibility</p>
<p>of them achieving their human potential?</p>
<p>What about the peer group influences?</p>
<p>What about the values and norms of the surrounding</p>
<p>human communities in which they&rsquo;re embedded?</p>
<p>Do they encourage the young person</p>
<p>to apply themselves in a systematic way</p>
<p>to their studies and to their focus</p>
<p>on their acquisition of language command</p>
<p>and of their educational potential?</p>
<p>So development is not only something</p>
<p>that is controlled by the society&rsquo;s practices,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also something that is influenced</p>
<p>by the cultural background of the individual.</p>
<p>And those things are not equal.</p>
<p>Those things vary across groups in a very significant way.</p>
<p>And that too will be a factor</p>
<p>determining disparities of outcome.</p>
<p>So when I see outcomes that are different,</p>
<p>I see wealth holding that&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>I see educational achievement that&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>I see representation in the professional schools</p>
<p>and law school and medical school</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s different between groups.</p>
<p>One question is are the institutions treating people fairly?</p>
<p>But another question is do the background</p>
<p>in social and cultural influences</p>
<p>equip people in the same way?</p>
<p>And we know that the answer to that,</p>
<p>not in every instance do they equip people in the same way.</p>
<p>And so it makes the judgment, the moral judgment</p>
<p>that we make when we see inequality of outcome complicated.</p>
<p>Inequality of outcome is a systemic factor to some degree,</p>
<p>but it is also a cultural factor to some degree,</p>
<p>I wanna say, and that&rsquo;s controversial, I know.</p>
<p>A lot of people, they think of themselves</p>
<p>as being progressive.</p>
<p>They wanna point a finger at society</p>
<p>whenever they see a disparity.</p>
<p>But I think that that&rsquo;s a mistake.</p>
<p>I think it misunderstands the difficulty of the problem.</p>
<p>You think that if you get the right law,</p>
<p>if you have the right public policy,</p>
<p>if the right politicians are elected to office,</p>
<p>suddenly those disparities will go away.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m here to tell you that that&rsquo;s a false hope.</p>
<p>And moreover, it is probably the wrong goal.</p>
<p>But I mean, we could go into that.</p>
<p>You were talking about affirmative action,</p>
<p>which is something else altogether.</p>
<p>And you were talking about me and my education,</p>
<p>which is also something that&rsquo;s a little bit different.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m happy to talk about those things.</p>
<p>Northwestern University, by the way, was a great university.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just joking, it&rsquo;s one of the great universities</p>
<p>of the world, yes.</p>
<p>And I studied mathematics at Northwestern University,</p>
<p>which is how I ended up at MIT in the first place.</p>
<p>And I got a very good technical training in mathematics</p>
<p>when I was at Northwestern, so.</p>
<p>You love both mathematics and human nature.</p>
<p>And so, which is why you ended up going into economics</p>
<p>at one of the great economics programs in the world at MIT</p>
<p>and getting your PhD there.</p>
<p>So one of the many hats you wear is that of an economist,</p>
<p>which allows you to think systematically and rigorously</p>
<p>about the way the world and the way humans work at scale.</p>
<p>Trying to remove the full mushy mess of humans,</p>
<p>like a psychology perspective, economics allows you to do.</p>
<p>Well, economics is one of the social sciences.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s value in psychology and in sociology.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to know that doesn&rsquo;t come up</p>
<p>within the study of economics.</p>
<p>We study markets and the dynamics of economic development</p>
<p>and trade and so on.</p>
<p>But yeah, speaking personally, as I was coming along,</p>
<p>I was fascinated by mathematics.</p>
<p>I was good at it and ended up at Northwestern</p>
<p>and took a lot of courses there in functional analysis</p>
<p>and logic and mathematics and dynamical systems</p>
<p>and stuff that I ended up employing</p>
<p>in my graduate studies in economics.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re right, I was not satisfied simply</p>
<p>to be proving theorems.</p>
<p>I wanted to be addressing issues of social significance</p>
<p>and economics.</p>
<p>I discovered to my delight was a field of study</p>
<p>that allowed me both to develop</p>
<p>rigorous analytical frameworks,</p>
<p>modeling and precision of logical deduction</p>
<p>and inference on the one hand,</p>
<p>satisfying my mathematical interests,</p>
<p>but on the other hand,</p>
<p>could address questions of social significance</p>
<p>like why does racial inequality persist?</p>
<p>Why are some countries prospering and growing</p>
<p>and others less so?</p>
<p>Why do the prices of raw materials fluctuate</p>
<p>in the way that they do over time and so on and so forth?</p>
<p>And I ended up falling in love with the application</p>
<p>of mathematical analysis to the study of social issues.</p>
<p>What do you use beautiful about mathematics,</p>
<p>about mathematical puzzles, about logic,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s still there.</p>
<p>The love for math is still there for you.</p>
<p>So is there something you could speak to?</p>
<p>What is the kernel, the flame of that love?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like magic.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, being able to prove something</p>
<p>and I mean, you know, I think of offhand,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s no largest prime number, okay?</p>
<p>So how would somebody know that?</p>
<p>Okay, what&rsquo;s a prime number?</p>
<p>So a prime number is a number that has a whole number</p>
<p>that has no divisor other than one.</p>
<p>There are no divisors of the number</p>
<p>that makes it a prime number, like 13 or 19 or 37,</p>
<p>whatever, okay.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re prime numbers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no largest prime number.</p>
<p>There are infinite number of prime numbers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no largest prime number, okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an idea.</p>
<p>You can get your mind around it in an instant.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take a whole lot of depth to see the question.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no largest prime number.</p>
<p>I wonder if prime numbers show up in economics.</p>
<p>I mean that.</p>
<p>Oh, they don&rsquo;t show up in economics except cryptography.</p>
<p>I understand that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>For code, you know, in coding stuff.</p>
<p>And that shows up in economics.</p>
<p>But in terms of models, probably not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, so prime numbers are little,</p>
<p>you know, in abstract algebra,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they show up in all these places</p>
<p>that are just like beautiful mathematical puzzles</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t immediately have an application,</p>
<p>but somehow maybe challenge you,</p>
<p>and as a result, push mathematics forward.</p>
<p>Like Fermat&rsquo;s last theorem, you know,</p>
<p>as far as I know, no obvious real world application,</p>
<p>but it has challenged mathematicians</p>
<p>throughout the centuries.</p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>And somehow indirectly progressed the field, but.</p>
<p>That the rational numbers are countable.</p>
<p>They can be put in one to one relationship</p>
<p>with the integers and, you know,</p>
<p>but that the real numbers are not countable</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot more real, quote unquote,</p>
<p>more real numbers.</p>
<p>These are orders of infinity.</p>
<p>This is Cantor, Georg Cantor, and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Or G√∂del&rsquo;s theorem, I studied this as an undergraduate,</p>
<p>you know, the incompleteness theorem</p>
<p>that there are propositions within any logical system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s rich enough to accommodate arithmetic.</p>
<p>There are going to be propositions</p>
<p>that you can formulate that are true,</p>
<p>but that you cannot prove to be true.</p>
<p>So the idea that you could systematically develop</p>
<p>a logical framework for mathematical inquiry</p>
<p>that could demonstrate the truth or falsity</p>
<p>of any proposition is not a feasible goal.</p>
<p>A feasible goal.</p>
<p>This was Hilbert&rsquo;s project as I understand it</p>
<p>and G√∂del showed that there was no hope ever</p>
<p>of being able to demonstrate the closure</p>
<p>of logical systems that were rich enough</p>
<p>to accommodate the real numbers.</p>
<p>They gave an existential crisis to all mathematicians</p>
<p>and scientists alike and humans</p>
<p>because maybe you can&rsquo;t prove everything.</p>
<p>I remember, you know, when I was a junior college,</p>
<p>a community college student</p>
<p>before I transferred to Northwestern</p>
<p>and I took a calculus course and it was a lot of fun</p>
<p>and it was differentiating algebraic expressions</p>
<p>and integrating and using trigonometric substitutions</p>
<p>and it was a lot of simple problem solving.</p>
<p>I get to Northwestern,</p>
<p>I take a course in differential equations.</p>
<p>And again, it was a lot of formulaic applying</p>
<p>if you get a differential equation of this structure</p>
<p>like if it&rsquo;s linear, you got exponentials, et cetera,</p>
<p>you can solve it.</p>
<p>And then I took a course that showed me, you know,</p>
<p>where the question was not how to solve</p>
<p>any particular functional expression,</p>
<p>but it was proving the existence of a solution</p>
<p>to a differential equation where it was like X dot equals</p>
<p>F of X and T and F is just some arbitrary function.</p>
<p>What do I have to assume about the function F</p>
<p>in order to know that there exists a solution</p>
<p>to the differential equation,</p>
<p>dx dt equals F of X and T.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s basically, they called it a Lipschitz condition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a condition about the bounding of the slope</p>
<p>of the function F as a function of X that it doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>that you can sort of uniformly bound the slope</p>
<p>on that function and then you can use a iterative process</p>
<p>to show that the sequence of, you know, partial solutions</p>
<p>to the thing converges to something that&rsquo;s a solution</p>
<p>to the real thing.</p>
<p>Anyway, again, I&rsquo;m not gonna bore you</p>
<p>or pretend that I&rsquo;m a mathematician, I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m saying is the difference</p>
<p>between a specific algebraic formula</p>
<p>that you can manipulate and solve on the one hand</p>
<p>and the abstract question of whether there exists</p>
<p>a solution in the general case is like a huge,</p>
<p>was like a huge step for me in my study of mathematics</p>
<p>and the techniques that you have to employ</p>
<p>to address these larger questions and so on.</p>
<p>So I, you know, when I was an undergraduate,</p>
<p>I took the first year PhD sequence in math analysis</p>
<p>at Northwestern from a brilliant mathematician</p>
<p>named Avner Friedman and learned about measure theory</p>
<p>and learned about some early functional analysis ideas</p>
<p>and when I saw that those ideas were being applied</p>
<p>by advanced study in economics, I was delighted.</p>
<p>I found an intellectual home.</p>
<p>So one of the fascinating challenges in mathematics</p>
<p>is to think how can you, which echoes</p>
<p>the challenge of economics, what are the properties</p>
<p>of an equation that allow you to say something profound</p>
<p>and say it simply?</p>
<p>And so the question of economics is how do you</p>
<p>construct a model where you can generalize nicely</p>
<p>and say something profound and say it simply?</p>
<p>So one of the questions, one of the challenges</p>
<p>of economics is macro versus microeconomics is,</p>
<p>you know, the world is made up of individuals.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a connection to this, our discussion</p>
<p>of race and discrimination and outcomes</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>The world is made up of individuals,</p>
<p>but in order to say something general,</p>
<p>we have to construct groups in order to analyze the data.</p>
<p>We have to aggregate that data somehow.</p>
<p>We have to make an average over some set of people.</p>
<p>So what are the pros and cons of looking at things</p>
<p>like equality of opportunity and equality of outcome</p>
<p>based on groups versus based on individuals</p>
<p>and what are the groups, if there&rsquo;s any pros</p>
<p>to looking at groups that we should be looking at?</p>
<p>Okay, well, those are big questions.</p>
<p>I mean, in economics, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I mean, micro, you have an account of how individuals</p>
<p>make decisions about spending their money</p>
<p>on this consumption side and about how enterprises</p>
<p>make decisions about what to produce, how much of it,</p>
<p>what inputs to use, what techniques of production</p>
<p>and so on, individual firms, individual consumers,</p>
<p>and then you want to aggregate.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a so called theory of general equilibrium</p>
<p>where you think supply and demand in a bunch of markets,</p>
<p>you think prices that move to equilibrate,</p>
<p>but you recognize that the price in one market</p>
<p>affects people&rsquo;s behavior in another,</p>
<p>the markets are interacting with each other.</p>
<p>You realize that the behavior of one individual</p>
<p>affects the supplies and available resources</p>
<p>and for other individuals, so they&rsquo;re knitted together</p>
<p>in some kind of systematic way.</p>
<p>And you want to try to demonstrate the fact</p>
<p>that notwithstanding all these interdependencies,</p>
<p>there exists a solution to the system of equations</p>
<p>that equates demand and supply</p>
<p>across all the different markets.</p>
<p>This is the existence of general equilibrium.</p>
<p>Then you want to try to say something about the properties</p>
<p>of an equilibrium, if it exists, is it efficient?</p>
<p>What do you mean by efficiency?</p>
<p>Well, the idea of so called Pareto efficient outcomes,</p>
<p>these are outcomes that cannot be uniformly improved upon,</p>
<p>everybody can&rsquo;t be made better off</p>
<p>by an alternative outcome.</p>
<p>You want to demonstrate the efficiency</p>
<p>of competitive equilibrium.</p>
<p>What do you mean by competition?</p>
<p>You mean that people take their actions</p>
<p>to do the best for themselves that they can.</p>
<p>Profits of firms, well being of consumers,</p>
<p>they try to do the best for themselves that they can,</p>
<p>but they do so in reference to a set of prices</p>
<p>that they believe they cannot control.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the criterion of competitive market circumstance.</p>
<p>So does a competitive equilibrium exist?</p>
<p>Do there exist a set of prices</p>
<p>which if everybody recognizes them as given</p>
<p>and responds to those prices on behalf of their own interest,</p>
<p>the outcome will be supply equaling demand</p>
<p>in all the markets where people are interacting</p>
<p>with one another, and that requires the use</p>
<p>of some concepts and topology, fixed point theorems</p>
<p>and whatnot that are familiar to mathematics,</p>
<p>not very deep mathematical results,</p>
<p>but important to economics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all about general equilibrium and whatnot.</p>
<p>But you ask about groups.</p>
<p>By the way, amazing whirlwind summary of all of economics,</p>
<p>but yes, go ahead, that was great.</p>
<p>Markets of competition of operator efficiency anyway,</p>
<p>but yes, groups.</p>
<p>And prices. And prices.</p>
<p>And by the way, there are some very beautiful</p>
<p>formalizations of everything that I&rsquo;m saying here.</p>
<p>You end up in vector spaces,</p>
<p>you end up with sets of bundles of consumption</p>
<p>and production, you end up with convexity,</p>
<p>you end up with hyperplanes,</p>
<p>which are in this finite dimensional vector space,</p>
<p>which are all of the bundles that have the same value</p>
<p>at a certain price.</p>
<p>You end up with inner products.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very pretty.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you almost forget that it&rsquo;s just a bunch</p>
<p>of humans transacting with each other.</p>
<p>That markets are made up of individuals.</p>
<p>Markets are made up of individuals.</p>
<p>And in order to carry out this formalization,</p>
<p>you have to make assumptions about the individuals.</p>
<p>And the end result is true in a formal sense,</p>
<p>but may not be true as a representation of the reality,</p>
<p>because it depends upon assumptions</p>
<p>that themselves may not hold.</p>
<p>But at least you know what it is that has to be true</p>
<p>in order for your formal framework to be relevant,</p>
<p>which is already a step in the right direction, I think.</p>
<p>I mean, the formalization is better than the intuition.</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t your intuition where we sit back</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t really know exactly what we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>because we haven&rsquo;t pinned it down in a precise way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in favor of the formalization.</p>
<p>People, they think, what is mathematics</p>
<p>and the social sciences?</p>
<p>After all, we&rsquo;re dealing with people.</p>
<p>People are not automata.</p>
<p>I agree with that.</p>
<p>But the analysis of the interaction of people,</p>
<p>I think, to be rigorous, requires us to be specific</p>
<p>about what we&rsquo;re talking about, about markets,</p>
<p>about consumers, about firms, about profits,</p>
<p>about technology, about preferences.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the language of economics.</p>
<p>But people&rsquo;s behavior depends upon what they seek in life,</p>
<p>depends upon their goals and their objectives.</p>
<p>Those things are at play.</p>
<p>They can be pushed this way or that.</p>
<p>So, I mean, nationalism,</p>
<p>fighting and dying for your country,</p>
<p>religion, sacrificing on behalf of some abstract ideal</p>
<p>of the good or of what is the human situation</p>
<p>and what is the meaning of life.</p>
<p>Economists have to assume that these things</p>
<p>are some particular thing</p>
<p>before they can turn the crank on their machine</p>
<p>to analyze the outcomes of human interaction.</p>
<p>And yet these things, belief in my identity,</p>
<p>but the things that I&rsquo;m willing to sacrifice and die</p>
<p>for purposes of life that I affirm</p>
<p>and pass on to my children are important preconditions</p>
<p>for actually carrying out any economic analysis.</p>
<p>And they are subject to manipulation and to change over time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not something that economics</p>
<p>has a whole lot to say about.</p>
<p>Well, is there some general things</p>
<p>that are really powerful in terms of,</p>
<p>you said nation, religion, those are groups.</p>
<p>Can you group people nicely</p>
<p>in helping you understand human nature?</p>
<p>So group them into nations based on their citizenry.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s geography, right?</p>
<p>The geographic location of your birth</p>
<p>or your long term residence, or maybe religious belief,</p>
<p>what religion you believe over time.</p>
<p>Is there groups like that?</p>
<p>And then race, is that useful?</p>
<p>What are the pros and cons of looking at outcomes</p>
<p>based on these kinds of groups, race in particular?</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re pros and I think they&rsquo;re cons.</p>
<p>I mean, I am myself, Glenn Loury sits before you right now,</p>
<p>a black American, an African American.</p>
<p>I quote unquote, I identify as,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the way they talk about it nowadays.</p>
<p>I identify as a black American.</p>
<p>My skin is brown, my hair is coarse, my nose is broad,</p>
<p>relative to the way other people&rsquo;s noses look.</p>
<p>My lips are thicker.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a consequence of my ancestral descent</p>
<p>from the human population resident in the African continent</p>
<p>in millennia past, my race.</p>
<p>Here in the United States,</p>
<p>we have various quote unquote races defined crudely</p>
<p>in the way that I just tried to define myself.</p>
<p>You could say, and I think there is a very powerful argument</p>
<p>that these are superficial differences.</p>
<p>I mean, really?</p>
<p>Why should it matter that your eye color</p>
<p>or your hair color or the shape of the bones in your face</p>
<p>or the color, the tone of your skin,</p>
<p>the amount of melanin,</p>
<p>how it is that you react to ultraviolet radiation</p>
<p>in terms of your skin, what is that the basis of anything?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s arbitrary, that&rsquo;s not meaningful.</p>
<p>Could there really be meaning</p>
<p>in these superficial differences among human beings?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that a archaic or barbaric way</p>
<p>of thinking about ourselves,</p>
<p>to look at each other&rsquo;s skin color or hair texture</p>
<p>and then to decide, oh, that&rsquo;s a black or that&rsquo;s a white</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s a Latin or that&rsquo;s an Asian or that&rsquo;s a whatever.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that we should outgrow, a person might say.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a relic of a kind of tribal society</p>
<p>of a kind of pre modern society</p>
<p>where we built real structure</p>
<p>on the basis of such superficial difference.</p>
<p>A person could say that.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I am a black American.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s part of my identity,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s part of my heritage,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s part of the stories that I tell myself</p>
<p>about who my people are.</p>
<p>Why do I need a people?</p>
<p>Why do I need a narrative of descent</p>
<p>in which I affiliate with a racially defined people?</p>
<p>Do I really need that?</p>
<p>I mean, I think that&rsquo;s an important question.</p>
<p>In fact, this is a confession, think of myself as black.</p>
<p>I could think of myself as simply human.</p>
<p>I could not identify specifically as black.</p>
<p>I could say, my eyes are brown too, so what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a brown eye?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m gonna invent a group based on my eye color.</p>
<p>I weigh 290 pounds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have a body size group.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a plus 200 and that&rsquo;s quote, who I am, close quote.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>I came from Chicago.</p>
<p>Yes, I do have a certain sense of affinity with my hometown.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Chicago born person,</p>
<p>but frankly, I haven&rsquo;t lived in Chicago since 1979.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a long time.</p>
<p>I wear my Chicago origins very, very lightly.</p>
<p>I would not go to war with someone from Cleveland</p>
<p>or St. Louis and fight to the death</p>
<p>with that St. Louis person or that Cleveland person</p>
<p>based upon the fact that we come from different cities.</p>
<p>And you have even abandoned in your heart</p>
<p>the Chicago Bulls.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some Chicago that&rsquo;s still in me, I suppose,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not very deep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not quote, who I am anymore.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m wondering, here I&rsquo;m trying to pose the question,</p>
<p>why is it that being a descendant of African slaves</p>
<p>should be who I am?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some answers.</p>
<p>One answer is people will look at me</p>
<p>and deal with me differently based upon what they see.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have control over that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be perceived as a member of a group,</p>
<p>whether or not I elect to affiliate myself</p>
<p>with that group or not.</p>
<p>Therefore, I need to be mindful of the fact</p>
<p>that regardless of what my internal orientation is,</p>
<p>the world will perceive me in a particular way</p>
<p>and will perceive me differently</p>
<p>based upon the color of my skin.</p>
<p>So a police officer who stops me at two o clock</p>
<p>in the morning because my tail light is out</p>
<p>and ask me for my automobile registration</p>
<p>and I reach quickly to the glove compartment</p>
<p>to get my registration.</p>
<p>And the police officer says, show me your hands.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t quite hear what he says</p>
<p>or I ignore what he says as I&rsquo;m getting my document</p>
<p>out of my glove compartment.</p>
<p>But the police officer thinks because I have not responded</p>
<p>to his demand to show my hands</p>
<p>that I might be reaching for a weapon.</p>
<p>And the police officer sees that I&rsquo;m black</p>
<p>and fears that the likelihood that I might have a weapon</p>
<p>is higher because in that town at that time,</p>
<p>a lot of the people who get stopped with weapons in their car</p>
<p>happen to be black and male and so on.</p>
<p>And he pulls his weapon and he discharges it</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m bleeding out there and I&rsquo;m dead now.</p>
<p>And all of that is a possibility that&rsquo;s very real</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s based upon the color of my skin.</p>
<p>And therefore, when he stops me,</p>
<p>I keep my hands on the steering wheel</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t go to the glove compartment.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m fearful of the fact that he might mistake me</p>
<p>for a criminal, et cetera.</p>
<p>Or I walk into a high end store, clothing store.</p>
<p>I see you&rsquo;re nicely dressed there, Lex.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, but that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>I do have some good clothes at home.</p>
<p>I just didn&rsquo;t wear them here today.</p>
<p>But you know what I mean.</p>
<p>And the salesman in the clothing store</p>
<p>either treats me like an old friend</p>
<p>and is warm and welcoming.</p>
<p>And what can I do for you, sir?</p>
<p>And let me show you this and that.</p>
<p>And what are you looking for?</p>
<p>Because he thinks I&rsquo;m gonna spend $1,000 there that day</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s gonna get a 5% commission or whatever it is.</p>
<p>And he either does that or he ignores me</p>
<p>and looks at me with suspicion</p>
<p>and thinks I might be trying to shoplift something</p>
<p>or thinks I&rsquo;m only gonna spend $50 and not $500</p>
<p>and therefore I&rsquo;m not worth his time.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m aware of the fact</p>
<p>that when I go into the clothing store,</p>
<p>especially the high end places where I can buy a good suit</p>
<p>or buy some really good dress shirts or slacks</p>
<p>that fit me well and so on,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aware of the fact that I may not be taken seriously</p>
<p>by the salesman based upon the fact</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s looking at me and he sees a black person.</p>
<p>And therefore I dress up</p>
<p>before I go out to buy clothes to get,</p>
<p>cause I wanna present myself</p>
<p>as not someone who just walked in off the street,</p>
<p>but as one of those black people</p>
<p>who is really prepared to spend some money in the store</p>
<p>so that I can be treated with respect.</p>
<p>And I have to carry the burden such as it is</p>
<p>of knowing that I need to earn the being taken seriously</p>
<p>being taken seriously by overcoming the suppositions</p>
<p>that people may have about me</p>
<p>based upon the color of my skin, something like that.</p>
<p>Or I ask myself, what am I gonna teach my children</p>
<p>about who they are and where they come from?</p>
<p>What stories am I gonna tell them about their ancestors?</p>
<p>Who are their ancestors?</p>
<p>Every African American has European ancestors.</p>
<p>Every black person in the United States of America,</p>
<p>I think that I can say that almost without exception.</p>
<p>We could go to 23andMe and look at the DNA.</p>
<p>They have European ancestors, they&rsquo;re not purely African.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fact and that&rsquo;s a consequence</p>
<p>of the experience of African descended people</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a mixed population.</p>
<p>My name is Lowry, spelled L O U R Y</p>
<p>but pronounced as if it were L O W E R Y.</p>
<p>And I gather if you trace the history of that name</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s Scottish.</p>
<p>So somewhere back then.</p>
<p>So you could identify as a Scot.</p>
<p>Well, or I could claim some Scottish descent, but I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who those ancestors are.</p>
<p>And frankly, I don&rsquo;t know who my enslaved ancestors are.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t trace my family history back very far</p>
<p>into the 19th century.</p>
<p>So what stories do I tell my children about who we are,</p>
<p>about who their ancestors are?</p>
<p>I mean, I wanna tell my children some story</p>
<p>and that story is gonna be colored, quote unquote,</p>
<p>by my race.</p>
<p>So even though it is superficial</p>
<p>and in an ideal world, you might think,</p>
<p>why would human beings, I mean, I read science fiction.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this Chinese writer, Chixin Liu is his name.</p>
<p>I might not pronounce it exactly right, C I X I N L I U.</p>
<p>Chixin Liu, he has a trilogy of The Three Body Problem,</p>
<p>The Dark Forest, and Death&rsquo;s End.</p>
<p>Those are the three books of Chixin Liu&rsquo;s trilogy</p>
<p>about how Trisolaris, which is another star system</p>
<p>within a few light years of the solar system,</p>
<p>and Earth get into a conflict.</p>
<p>And when the Trisolaris come down to dominate Earth,</p>
<p>suddenly all of these differences between the Chinese</p>
<p>and the North Americans and the Europeans</p>
<p>and the Africans and the South Asians</p>
<p>become kind of insignificant because after all,</p>
<p>the Trisolaris with their advanced civilization</p>
<p>whose star system is dying,</p>
<p>have their eyes on the solar system,</p>
<p>which has a planet, the third rock from the sun</p>
<p>that is pretty habitable and the difference between us</p>
<p>become pretty insignificant.</p>
<p>So we shouldn&rsquo;t need for an invasion</p>
<p>by extraterrestrial beings to have to happen</p>
<p>before we would recognize the common humanity</p>
<p>that we all share that is profound and is deep.</p>
<p>We all descend in effect from the same ancestral population</p>
<p>of Homo sapiens who walked out of East Africa eons ago</p>
<p>and have survived amongst all of the different possible</p>
<p>variations of species and whatnot,</p>
<p>of humanoid population, the Homo sapiens have flourished,</p>
<p>the others have died out and here we are</p>
<p>and we can just look at the genetic endowments</p>
<p>that characterize our biological essence</p>
<p>and we can see that we are quote unquote</p>
<p>the same beneath the skin</p>
<p>and yet we end up freighting so much weight</p>
<p>onto these superficial differences.</p>
<p>So I can see both sides of the issue is what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>I can see the argument race is an irrelevancy</p>
<p>because at the end of the day, deep down it is.</p>
<p>But I can also see the argument</p>
<p>that I hold on to racial identity because A,</p>
<p>my racial presentation colors how other people deal with me</p>
<p>but B, because everybody needs a story.</p>
<p>Everybody needs an account.</p>
<p>You tell me you&rsquo;re Jewish.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know how deep that is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how genetically profound that is.</p>
<p>I do know that it&rsquo;s a culturally profound identity</p>
<p>for a lot of people based upon maybe some of the same</p>
<p>kind of forces that I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>A, they won&rsquo;t let you not be Jewish.</p>
<p>You could say you&rsquo;re not Jewish</p>
<p>but when Hitler is rounding people up,</p>
<p>what you say doesn&rsquo;t have a whole lot to do</p>
<p>with what the Gestapo was about.</p>
<p>And B, you need to tell your children a story.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the fascinating thing about this tribalism</p>
<p>that you spoke about that we form tribes as humans</p>
<p>throughout human history, form tribes</p>
<p>and have directed hate toward other tribes</p>
<p>and sometimes violence and destruction.</p>
<p>And yet tribalism allows you to tell a story</p>
<p>to your children, allows you to grow a culture.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about defining yourself</p>
<p>within a particular tribe that allows you</p>
<p>to have a tradition.</p>
<p>You have an article that you wrote</p>
<p>called The Case for Black Patriotism.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>So I should also say it&rsquo;s so interesting</p>
<p>because for me personally, I feel, identify as,</p>
<p>believe I am an American.</p>
<p>And yet within the American umbrella,</p>
<p>it feels that there&rsquo;s a longing for other tribes.</p>
<p>You mentioned Jewish but what I honestly feel is,</p>
<p>I mean a lot of it is humor and culture and so on</p>
<p>is Russian and Ukrainian because that&rsquo;s where I come from.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where my family is from.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s like stereotypical things</p>
<p>that are funny, humorous type of thing about Russians</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s showing no emotion, good at chess and math,</p>
<p>into wrestling, drinking vodka.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s literally every single stereotype.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the embodiment of that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a, you celebrate that in certain kinds of ways.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tradition there within the American umbrella</p>
<p>and some of it is humor, some of it is little quirks</p>
<p>of culture but now with the war in Russia and Ukraine,</p>
<p>interestingly enough, even that little thing,</p>
<p>it becomes also a source of negative tribalism.</p>
<p>But anyway, that context aside, what is black patriotism</p>
<p>and why do you feel?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m speaking in an article called</p>
<p>The Case for Black Patriotism in a Particular Context</p>
<p>and what I&rsquo;m saying basically is very simple.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying we are African Americans</p>
<p>and the emphasis should be on the American.</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t even much care</p>
<p>for the framing African American</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not gonna fight with people about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s worth fighting about.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not how, I would just say we&rsquo;re Americans</p>
<p>or if you want, we&rsquo;re black Americans.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re certainly not African.</p>
<p>That is the African American population</p>
<p>is a population of people who come into existence</p>
<p>here in North America through the cauldron of slavery.</p>
<p>There are also immigrants, immigrants from East Africa,</p>
<p>immigrants from West Africa, immigrants from Southern Africa,</p>
<p>immigrants from the Caribbean who descend</p>
<p>from an ancestral population which is African.</p>
<p>The history of the world since 1500 is a history</p>
<p>in which people of African descent are scattered</p>
<p>because of slavery throughout the Western hemisphere.</p>
<p>And so here we are.</p>
<p>But the institution of slavery ended in 1863</p>
<p>in the United States.</p>
<p>The struggle that we started out talking about</p>
<p>which gave rise to Martin Luther King giving that speech</p>
<p>that you say is the greatest speech in American history</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not gonna argue with you about that,</p>
<p>happened right here in the United States.</p>
<p>We are, what is the United States?</p>
<p>The United States is a nation of immigrants.</p>
<p>The population of the North American continent</p>
<p>was sparsely populated by an indigenous population</p>
<p>which was destroyed in conquest by a European population</p>
<p>that settled here in North America and appropriated the land</p>
<p>and have built a civilization here</p>
<p>which has been peopled by a large influx of immigrants</p>
<p>of individuals from Europe, Irish and Italian</p>
<p>and Greek and Slavic and Jewish, Russian Jews</p>
<p>coming in large numbers and so on</p>
<p>and wave after wave after wave of immigration,</p>
<p>Asian, Latin American population of people</p>
<p>who have come to reside here in the United States</p>
<p>and we black Americans who descend from slaves.</p>
<p>We African Americans who descend from slaves.</p>
<p>So here we are.</p>
<p>This is a great nation.</p>
<p>I mean, this is a monumentally significant political force</p>
<p>which is the United States of America founded in 1776, 1787</p>
<p>fought a war of independence from the British,</p>
<p>established a republic which is a confederation</p>
<p>of these independent colonies</p>
<p>which has grown into now the 50 states</p>
<p>of the United States of America, continental nation.</p>
<p>The richest and most powerful nation on the planet</p>
<p>with massive influence throughout the world</p>
<p>for good and for ill.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s who we are, I wanna say to black people.</p>
<p>There is no other home for us.</p>
<p>This fantasy of we being a people apart</p>
<p>back in the day when I was coming along in the 1960s,</p>
<p>there was something called</p>
<p>the Republic of New Africa Movement</p>
<p>and they wanted some states in the South</p>
<p>given over to black people</p>
<p>and we were gonna have our own country.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a joke, it&rsquo;s a fantasy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mythic, unbalanced,</p>
<p>the unrealistic fanciful politics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a serious politics.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re Americans, we&rsquo;re not going anywhere here.</p>
<p>The idea that, and I wanna say this</p>
<p>in a number of different registers,</p>
<p>I wanna say first of all,</p>
<p>we need to make peace with the fact</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s who we are and that&rsquo;s where we are.</p>
<p>So nobody is coming, the world court</p>
<p>is not gonna litigate our disputes.</p>
<p>The United Nations is not gonna set up a desk</p>
<p>for people of African descent who reside in North America.</p>
<p>We have to work out whatever our concerns are</p>
<p>with our fellow Americans right here</p>
<p>within the context of American politics.</p>
<p>That means compromise.</p>
<p>That means looking for a framework for political expression</p>
<p>which is broader than our racial identity, et cetera.</p>
<p>So I wanna say that.</p>
<p>But I also wanna say there&rsquo;s no reason</p>
<p>to apologize for this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something positive to affirm.</p>
<p>I take on this question about slavery in brief,</p>
<p>because in fact, slavery was awful and it was wrong</p>
<p>and it was on the backs of the enslaved Africans</p>
<p>and it had consequences that have endured</p>
<p>long after the termination of the thing.</p>
<p>But I also wanna say, look at what has happened</p>
<p>in the last 150 years for African Americans.</p>
<p>And I wanna say, look at the vitality</p>
<p>of the institutions here in the United States of America,</p>
<p>of the Democratic Republic of the United States of America.</p>
<p>Again, not perfect, which are malleable enough,</p>
<p>these institutions to allow for the transformation</p>
<p>of the status of African Americans</p>
<p>such as has occurred since the end of slavery.</p>
<p>And I wanna say there&rsquo;s a lot to celebrate in that.</p>
<p>So this is our country.</p>
<p>We are full members of the polity.</p>
<p>We have burdens and responsibilities</p>
<p>as well as privileges that are associated</p>
<p>with our membership in this Republic.</p>
<p>That does not mean that we should not fight</p>
<p>for what we believe to be right,</p>
<p>although we are not one voice here, we black Americans.</p>
<p>It does not mean that we should not protest things</p>
<p>that we think are deserving of protest.</p>
<p>But I wanna say, it does mean that we should not reject</p>
<p>the framework that we&rsquo;re operating in</p>
<p>because we basically don&rsquo;t have any alternative.</p>
<p>And because when viewed in full context,</p>
<p>a noble and profoundly significant achievement,</p>
<p>the United States of America and a beacon</p>
<p>to the rest of the world, I don&rsquo;t wanna go off</p>
<p>in some starry eyed kind of jingoistic celebration</p>
<p>of America as the greatest civilization, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>But this great nation is our nation.</p>
<p>And I think we do best by beginning,</p>
<p>we black Americans do best by beginning,</p>
<p>this is my argument in the piece,</p>
<p>by beginning from a framework which accepts that fact</p>
<p>and then builds on it.</p>
<p>So black patriotism is, if not exactly the same,</p>
<p>rhymes, echoes American patriotism.</p>
<p>So a black American is first and foremost an American.</p>
<p>Yeah, a black American is first and foremost an American</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a good thing too.</p>
<p>Let me return to the question of Dr. King</p>
<p>and another powerful, impactful individual, Malcolm X,</p>
<p>to ask you the question.</p>
<p>Well, first, people often perhaps inaccurately portray them</p>
<p>as representing two different ideals, approaches</p>
<p>to the fight for civil rights.</p>
<p>So Martin Luther King for the nonviolent approach,</p>
<p>the peacemaker, and Malcolm X is the by any means necessary.</p>
<p>What do you think about this distinction?</p>
<p>And broadly speaking, in black patriotism,</p>
<p>in the future of black Americans in the 21st century,</p>
<p>what is the role of anger?</p>
<p>What is the role of protest?</p>
<p>Even violence encompasses a lot of things,</p>
<p>but just aggression and the fuck the man,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to have to make change, force change.</p>
<p>Okay, I think you put your finger on something</p>
<p>really important in the context of,</p>
<p>we were just discussing my black patriotism essay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the only story.</p>
<p>There is another story and Malcolm X is someone</p>
<p>you identify and his memory lives on</p>
<p>and is powerfully influential.</p>
<p>And I think you see it in Black Lives Matter,</p>
<p>and I think you see it in the protest and rioting</p>
<p>and so forth that has broken out periodically</p>
<p>going all the way back to the 1960s and before,</p>
<p>but especially since the 1960s.</p>
<p>You saw it in Los Angeles in 1992,</p>
<p>the Rodney King civil disturbances</p>
<p>that broke out there and the balled up fist,</p>
<p>the radical afrocentric rejection</p>
<p>of the American story that Martin Luther King,</p>
<p>he believed in.</p>
<p>He believed in a magnificent promissory note.</p>
<p>And a lot of people are rolling their eyes</p>
<p>and saying, as you say,</p>
<p>fuck the man, magnificent promissory note.</p>
<p>I mean, just get your knee off my neck.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you can do for me.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ask me to believe in your BS</p>
<p>about some magnificent promissory note,</p>
<p>some founding fathers who were all slave owners anyway.</p>
<p>I mean, just get your knee off my neck.</p>
<p>Now, I can relate to that.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, I grew up in Chicago in the 1950s</p>
<p>and the 1960s.</p>
<p>I remember Malcolm X, I mean, literally in real time.</p>
<p>I remember when he was murdered in 1965</p>
<p>in the Audubon Ballroom in Harlem,</p>
<p>in Manhattan, in New York City.</p>
<p>I remember my uncle, I was raised in a house</p>
<p>where my aunt and uncle were the master of the house.</p>
<p>And my mother and my sister and I lived</p>
<p>in a small apartment upstairs in the back</p>
<p>of this big house that my successful aunt and uncle owned.</p>
<p>And my uncle was a small businessman,</p>
<p>a barber and a tradesman.</p>
<p>He was a hustler.</p>
<p>I mean, legally, he did what he had to do to make money.</p>
<p>He was a very enterprising, not especially well educated,</p>
<p>but a very intelligent and disciplined</p>
<p>and resourceful provider for his family,</p>
<p>which included myself, my sister,</p>
<p>and my mother in their household.</p>
<p>And we called him Uncle Mooney</p>
<p>because he had moon shaped eyes</p>
<p>that protruded and were round.</p>
<p>Uncle Mooney, James Ellis was his name.</p>
<p>Uncle Mooney, James Ellis Lee was my Uncle Mooney.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m saying all that to say this.</p>
<p>He admired the nation of Islam.</p>
<p>I mean, King and Malcolm X,</p>
<p>Martin King and Malcolm X differed</p>
<p>along a number of different dimensions.</p>
<p>Malcolm X was a Muslim.</p>
<p>And Martin Luther King Jr. was a Christian minister.</p>
<p>My Uncle Mooney didn&rsquo;t have any time</p>
<p>for these Christian ministers.</p>
<p>He thought that was the white man&rsquo;s religion.</p>
<p>And back in that day, you&rsquo;d go into a black church</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d see a portrait of Jesus</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;d be blonde hair, blue eyed.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t even look like a Mediterranean.</p>
<p>I mean, he didn&rsquo;t look like somebody who came from Palestine.</p>
<p>I mean, he looked like somebody who came</p>
<p>from Northern Europe or something like that,</p>
<p>the picture of Jesus.</p>
<p>And my Uncle Mooney rejected that whole thing.</p>
<p>He would be damned if he was gonna bend his knee</p>
<p>to some white Jesus.</p>
<p>But he was not a Muslim either.</p>
<p>But he respected the Muslims.</p>
<p>He brought home their newspaper.</p>
<p>It was called Muhammad Speaks.</p>
<p>This is the nation of Islam,</p>
<p>which is the black Muslim movement</p>
<p>founded in American cities in Detroit and then Chicago,</p>
<p>going back to the early middle 20th century</p>
<p>and growing into a very significant movement</p>
<p>that had a lot of influence,</p>
<p>Louis Farrakhan and controversial figure</p>
<p>descends from this movement.</p>
<p>It has fractured now</p>
<p>and has the major part of the legacy of the black Muslims</p>
<p>has assimilated itself into Islam proper.</p>
<p>Malcolm X made a famous pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina</p>
<p>and came back with a very different vision</p>
<p>about what it meant to be a Muslim</p>
<p>and understood himself to be a part of the large tradition</p>
<p>and religious culture of Islam that has a global reach.</p>
<p>And he had a different vision when he came back from that.</p>
<p>Some people say that&rsquo;s why he was killed and so on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I certainly find that to be plausible</p>
<p>that he became the constituted threat to the sect,</p>
<p>which was the black Muslims</p>
<p>and had to be dealt with.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;ll ever know the full story on that.</p>
<p>But anyway, what I&rsquo;m trying to say is</p>
<p>the black Muslims were there, Malcolm X was there.</p>
<p>And in my experience,</p>
<p>they constituted a counterpoint to the position of king,</p>
<p>which depended on a kind of respect</p>
<p>for the best of the tradition of American democracy,</p>
<p>appealing to the better nature of our oppressors,</p>
<p>live up to the full meaning of our creed.</p>
<p>I mean, these are words that he would use.</p>
<p>A magnificent promissory note is what he would think of</p>
<p>as the declaration of independence</p>
<p>and the legacy of Abraham Lincoln,</p>
<p>a unfulfilled ideal.</p>
<p>And the black Muslims were like, fuck that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna take care of our own.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna build our own schools.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna build our own businesses.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not waiting for the white man to do anything.</p>
<p>Get your knee off my neck and get out of my way</p>
<p>and let me take care of my own.</p>
<p>And my uncle respected that.</p>
<p>He respected the straight back,</p>
<p>the stand up straight with your shoulders back.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a Jordan Peterson.</p>
<p>But I mean, that was way before Jordan Peterson,</p>
<p>but that was his philosophy.</p>
<p>Stand up straight, but just raise your children.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be depending upon welfare.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re taking welfare from the white man.</p>
<p>You need to get busy.</p>
<p>You need to educate yourself.</p>
<p>You need to clean up your act.</p>
<p>Put down the fried chicken because it&rsquo;s gonna kill you.</p>
<p>My uncle Mooney loved this book that Elijah Muhammad,</p>
<p>they called him the honorable Elijah Muhammad,</p>
<p>who was the founder and the leader of the nation of Islam.</p>
<p>He had a book and all the book said was,</p>
<p>be smart, eat green vegetables, don&rsquo;t eat fried food.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t eat pork.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re Muslims.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t eat pork and take responsibility for your diet</p>
<p>and be healthy.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t be putting a whole lot of pills into your body.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to do that</p>
<p>if you just get control of your diet</p>
<p>and you eat properly.</p>
<p>My uncle loves this idea of responsibility for self</p>
<p>and a determination to build.</p>
<p>He respected that in the Muslims,</p>
<p>even if he didn&rsquo;t buy the religious part of it.</p>
<p>And so, and by the way, when my uncle died in 1983,</p>
<p>he left me a bequest.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t money, unfortunately.</p>
<p>It was his complete collection</p>
<p>of the recorded speeches of Malcolm X.</p>
<p>And I have these albums.</p>
<p>These are 33 and a third LPs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s six of them.</p>
<p>And I have a complete collection,</p>
<p>as best as my uncle could assemble,</p>
<p>of the recorded speeches of Malcolm X.</p>
<p>Now, why did he do that?</p>
<p>He did that because he did not want me to forget.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be dependent upon the white man.</p>
<p>Build your own.</p>
<p>Stand up straight with your shoulders back.</p>
<p>Proud black man, take care of your business.</p>
<p>Take care of your children.</p>
<p>Pick up the trash in front of your house.</p>
<p>Get busy.</p>
<p>This was this philosophy.</p>
<p>So violence now, that&rsquo;s another story.</p>
<p>I mean, Malcolm X would say,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna defend ourselves.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna mess with us,</p>
<p>you racist Ku Klux Klan or whatever.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna arm ourselves and we&rsquo;re gonna fight you back.</p>
<p>You racist police who are oppressing</p>
<p>and persecuting and abusing our people,</p>
<p>well, you better be ready</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re gonna fight you back.</p>
<p>And that too was the spirit that my uncle,</p>
<p>that was a kind of attitude, a kind of posture.</p>
<p>My uncle was not a radical.</p>
<p>He was a businessman, but he respected this idea.</p>
<p>You take your life in your own hands when you mess with us</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re prepared to defend ourselves.</p>
<p>So that blood runs in you too.</p>
<p>That thread is, when you write about black patriotism,</p>
<p>that thread is there too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you embody both the ideal that we&rsquo;re all American,</p>
<p>but also that there is this oppressive history.</p>
<p>There is the powerful that are manipulating you,</p>
<p>that are oppressing you, and you can&rsquo;t just wait around</p>
<p>for things to fix themselves.</p>
<p>You have to take action.</p>
<p>You have to take things into your own hands.</p>
<p>And sometimes that means being angry.</p>
<p>Sometimes that means being violent.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s there too.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s there, but here, and the but is,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, me today, Glenn Loury in 2022,</p>
<p>think that that is the answer.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that violent rebellion gets us anywhere</p>
<p>at the end of the day.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re past that.</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t Knight Rider, Ku Klux Klan,</p>
<p>people breaking down your door and dragging you away.</p>
<p>There are not nooses thrown over a tree limb</p>
<p>where you hang somebody from the tree</p>
<p>because they whistled at a white woman</p>
<p>or they got too much property in your community</p>
<p>and you became, they were uppity Negroes</p>
<p>and whatnot like that.</p>
<p>That is a thing of the past in America</p>
<p>that the situation is no longer the one</p>
<p>that requires that kind of violent reaction</p>
<p>and that there is, if we look at the net effect</p>
<p>of the so called rebellions in American cities,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re negative.</p>
<p>The George Floyd protests, which became violent</p>
<p>and arsonists in the aftermath of civil disturbance</p>
<p>and whatnot in the summer of 2020,</p>
<p>I think set back the program for African Americans.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it advanced it.</p>
<p>I think there are things to be concerned about,</p>
<p>schools that are not working,</p>
<p>police that are not respecting citizens and so forth.</p>
<p>But I think that those are things</p>
<p>that affect white Americans as well</p>
<p>and that the way to ultimately correct those things</p>
<p>is to make alliance and associate oneself</p>
<p>with Americans who are concerned to change these things.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s properly framed</p>
<p>as a racial problem.</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t think that violent rebellion</p>
<p>gets us anywhere.</p>
<p>I get the historical salience of that posture</p>
<p>and it made a lot of sense</p>
<p>in the early and the mid 20th century.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it makes very much sense at all</p>
<p>in the early 21st century.</p>
<p>Well, thank you for allowing me for a brief moment</p>
<p>to try to channel your Uncle Mooney</p>
<p>and maybe Malcolm X in this conversation</p>
<p>as we look forward to the 21st century.</p>
<p>You mentioned that in part,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re troubled by the term African American.</p>
<p>So words are funny things until they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>So let me ask you about what I think</p>
<p>is one of the most powerful and controversial words</p>
<p>in the English language, the N word.</p>
<p>So this is a word that I can&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>that only certain people have the right to say.</p>
<p>I have a friend, Joe Rogan, who has,</p>
<p>what would you say, there was mass pushback</p>
<p>or highlighting of the fact that he didn&rsquo;t just say N word</p>
<p>but said the full word many times</p>
<p>throughout his conversations</p>
<p>when referring to, in a meta way,</p>
<p>about the power of words,</p>
<p>especially when related to certain comedians</p>
<p>using those words.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What do you think about this word?</p>
<p>Is it empowering?</p>
<p>Is it destructive?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>What does it mean for race in America?</p>
<p>What does it mean that people like Joe Rogan</p>
<p>were essentially, there&rsquo;s an attack to cancel him</p>
<p>for using the word?</p>
<p>Just as a scholar of human nature,</p>
<p>what do you think about this whole thing?</p>
<p>This is a phenomenon that interests me.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The N word, nigger, I can say it because I&rsquo;m black.</p>
<p>But I mean, I can also say it because I like hip hop.</p>
<p>And when I listen to hip hop, I hear the word all the time.</p>
<p>These niggas ain&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>you better watch out for these, et cetera.</p>
<p>I heard the word constantly as I was growing up</p>
<p>as a boy and a young man in Chicago.</p>
<p>Niggas ain&rsquo;t shit.</p>
<p>That was said.</p>
<p>That was, you know,</p>
<p>and that could be a reflection of some kind of pathology</p>
<p>within the African American community of self hatred</p>
<p>and so forth.</p>
<p>It could be, or it could just be a colloquial linguistic way.</p>
<p>I mean, I assume other groups also have their various,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how the Irish talk about their Irish brothers</p>
<p>and, you know, whatever.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know how the Jews talk about</p>
<p>the Jewish brothers and whatever.</p>
<p>But black people, when talking about other black people</p>
<p>use the N word all the time.</p>
<p>My nigger, N I G G A, you know, my nigger.</p>
<p>That is a term of endearment.</p>
<p>My friend, Randall Kennedy,</p>
<p>the law professor at Harvard University</p>
<p>has a book called Nigger.</p>
<p>And he uses the word in the title of the book,</p>
<p>the history of a strange history of a provocative word.</p>
<p>At some point there&rsquo;s a subtitle,</p>
<p>but the title of the book is N I G G E R colon.</p>
<p>And then he has a subtitle.</p>
<p>I think, of course, the use of the word as a slur</p>
<p>and an insult, which is a part of the history</p>
<p>of black people in the United States,</p>
<p>the use of the word by the Southern racist segregationist,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t want no niggers up in here.</p>
<p>Yall, you know, niggers have no place in my restaurant,</p>
<p>in my store, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s meant to be an insult.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an insult to people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fighting word.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a way that you say that to somebody.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a invitation for conflict.</p>
<p>That said, what is it that about this particular word</p>
<p>and also the asymmetry of it,</p>
<p>that do you think it&rsquo;s empowering</p>
<p>to the black community to own a word?</p>
<p>My honest answer to you is I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fully understand it.</p>
<p>It has become symbolic in a way.</p>
<p>And the policing of the use of the word,</p>
<p>I can say it, but white people can&rsquo;t say it.</p>
<p>I can say it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a racist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a self hating black.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just speaking the language of colloquial English</p>
<p>that has emerged amongst African Americans</p>
<p>in which that word plays a big role.</p>
<p>But the prohibition on its use by others.</p>
<p>And of course, in the Joe Rogan case,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t as if he was calling anybody an N word.</p>
<p>He was simply pointing out that people had said stuff</p>
<p>in which the N word was a part of what they said.</p>
<p>Now, he did make the statement about,</p>
<p>how did he put it?</p>
<p>The planet of the apes,</p>
<p>that one of the offensive things that he said,</p>
<p>he walked into a room,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of black guys standing around.</p>
<p>He says, like planet of the apes.</p>
<p>He said it&rsquo;s like Africa, planet of the apes.</p>
<p>Yeah, he should have been a little bit more careful.</p>
<p>That was an insult.</p>
<p>That was something that if you say that</p>
<p>and people are offended,</p>
<p>they have a right to be offended.</p>
<p>And if you didn&rsquo;t mean to offend them,</p>
<p>you can apologize.</p>
<p>And he did apologize.</p>
<p>I accept his apology.</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s okay with me as far as that goes.</p>
<p>In fact, John McWhorter and I at the podcast that I do,</p>
<p>The Glenn Show, had a conversation,</p>
<p>part of which touched on the Joe Rogan phenomenon.</p>
<p>And we concluded he didn&rsquo;t really do anything wrong.</p>
<p>I mean, you can like or you can hate him or whatever,</p>
<p>but the idea that he&rsquo;s a racist is kind of ridiculous.</p>
<p>So frankly, I mean, if that&rsquo;s your test</p>
<p>of what constitutes a racist, the utterance of the word,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s kind of silly as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.</p>
<p>What do you think about the rigorous testing of people</p>
<p>to the degree they&rsquo;re racist or not?</p>
<p>The accusation of racism being a way to attack,</p>
<p>to bully, to divide.</p>
<p>So what are the pros and cons of that once again?</p>
<p>Because it does reveal the assholes and the racists,</p>
<p>but it can hurt people who are not.</p>
<p>Well, I think we have a history here in the United States</p>
<p>of blatant racism that goes back a long way.</p>
<p>And that has present day echoes.</p>
<p>So there are racists.</p>
<p>I mean, there are people who will look and see,</p>
<p>oh, those are black people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re patronizing this business.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna patronize this business anymore.</p>
<p>Who if their daughter or their son is dating somebody</p>
<p>that is black, they will say,</p>
<p>I really wish you wouldn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>I mean, why are you hanging out with those people?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you know who they are?</p>
<p>There are people, there are racists, okay?</p>
<p>There are black racists.</p>
<p>That is black people who see somebody who&rsquo;s white</p>
<p>and who then invoke a whole lot of stereotypes or whatever,</p>
<p>or have a visceral dislike based upon nothing</p>
<p>other than the color of the person&rsquo;s skin.</p>
<p>Such people exist.</p>
<p>Racism is a real thing, et cetera.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I think this,</p>
<p>throwing around the accusation of racism,</p>
<p>a college professor is teaching a course.</p>
<p>He says in the context of teaching the course</p>
<p>that the underrepresentation of blacks</p>
<p>in physics program at this university</p>
<p>is because they score lower on the test than other groups</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not qualified.</p>
<p>So say the professor gives a lecture and he says,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have more blacks in the physics department</p>
<p>at this university because there are not enough</p>
<p>qualified blacks.</p>
<p>Somebody in the classroom who hears that,</p>
<p>a black student, objects.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a racist, okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a power move.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a move to try to control the conversation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an argument, it&rsquo;s an epithet.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve said that a person who has a particular idea</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t like, maybe that idea is,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m against affirmative action, I think it&rsquo;s unfair.</p>
<p>I was just with Dorian Abbott.</p>
<p>Dorian Abbott is a scientist at the University of Chicago</p>
<p>who published a piece in Newsweek magazine</p>
<p>in which he said that he thought affirmative action</p>
<p>and racial balancing was unethical.</p>
<p>He was invited to give a lecture at MIT,</p>
<p>a very distinguished lecture in his field</p>
<p>based on planetary science.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly what it is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a scientist.</p>
<p>But in any case, because he had said</p>
<p>that he didn&rsquo;t like affirmative action</p>
<p>and he thought affirmative action was racist,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s basically what he said.</p>
<p>Why are we looking at people based upon their race</p>
<p>and decide we should just do it on the merit?</p>
<p>That was his position.</p>
<p>Now, people protesting at the university</p>
<p>where he was invited, MIT, saying that he&rsquo;s a racist</p>
<p>because he had that opinion.</p>
<p>He gets disinvited.</p>
<p>Charles Murray is a popular social science writer</p>
<p>who is famous for his book about IQ, The Bell Curve,</p>
<p>one chapter of which chronicles the racial differences</p>
<p>between black and white in performance</p>
<p>on mental ability tests and speculates about the extent</p>
<p>to which such differences may be connected</p>
<p>with the genetic inheritance of these racially diverse people.</p>
<p>Now, he could be wrong about everything that he&rsquo;s saying.</p>
<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center calls him a white supremacist</p>
<p>because he observes that there are racial differences</p>
<p>in measured intellectual ability amongst Americans</p>
<p>of different racial descent.</p>
<p>He could be wrong.</p>
<p>Let me stipulate that he is wrong.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t wanna argue about whether he&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>or wrong.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna argue about whether he&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>or about whether he&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s addressing himself to a factual issue.</p>
<p>And now the issue becomes instead of grappling</p>
<p>with the factual questions at hand</p>
<p>and demonstrating his rightness or wrongness</p>
<p>about those questions, the issue becomes his character.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a racist.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, in my mind, a lot like calling him a witch.</p>
<p>And the use of that word now, I think,</p>
<p>has parallels to accusing people of witchcraft</p>
<p>because they have views about substantive questions</p>
<p>that bear on racial inequality or racial difference</p>
<p>that a person finds unacceptable</p>
<p>or that a person disagrees with.</p>
<p>And you think you can shut somebody up.</p>
<p>Crime in the cities of Chicago, St. Louis, Baltimore,</p>
<p>Philadelphia, Washington, DC is out of control,</p>
<p>some person might say.</p>
<p>Murder rate is high.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s committing those crimes?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re mostly black young men who are doing the carjackings</p>
<p>and who are doing the shootings.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re killing each other.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re making our city unlivable.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s a hypothetical statement that I offer.</p>
<p>It might be correct, it might be incorrect.</p>
<p>It might be appropriate, it might be inappropriate.</p>
<p>It may be true, but something that we would be better off</p>
<p>if people didn&rsquo;t focus on, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Responding to someone making that statement,</p>
<p>have you seen what has happened to my city?</p>
<p>It used to be that you could go to North Michigan Avenue</p>
<p>and you could find one after another</p>
<p>after another high end shop.</p>
<p>This is in Chicago, my hometown.</p>
<p>And tourists would come and they&rsquo;d go to the theater</p>
<p>and there were restaurants and they&rsquo;d go out.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t do it anymore.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>Half of those stores are boarded up now.</p>
<p>You know why?</p>
<p>Because when George Floyd was killed,</p>
<p>black people mobbed in the city and they burnt</p>
<p>and they rioted and they looted</p>
<p>and it hasn&rsquo;t been the same ever since.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m moving to the suburbs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be damned if I&rsquo;m gonna send my children</p>
<p>to those schools.</p>
<p>A person could say that.</p>
<p>They might be right, they might be wrong to say it.</p>
<p>Calling them a racist is exactly not</p>
<p>a rebuttal of what they said.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a move.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a move to try to take control of the conversation</p>
<p>by accusing someone of having bad character</p>
<p>because they said something that made you uncomfortable,</p>
<p>which you can&rsquo;t deal with.</p>
<p>So you think you can shut them up by calling them a racist.</p>
<p>You might as well be calling them a witch.</p>
<p>You might as well be calling for their head on a platter</p>
<p>because they believe that Satan is Lord</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the kind of quote argument, close quote,</p>
<p>which is precisely not an argument</p>
<p>that people who invoke that term are using.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what I have to say about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fool&rsquo;s errand to try to refute somebody</p>
<p>by calling them a witch.</p>
<p>Likewise, it&rsquo;s a fool&rsquo;s errand to try to rebut</p>
<p>the contrary forces in American politics</p>
<p>that are a reaction often to real things</p>
<p>that are going on on the ground in black communities</p>
<p>in the cities across this country</p>
<p>by calling people a racist.</p>
<p>You may shut them up, but you won&rsquo;t change their minds.</p>
<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>At the end of the day, they&rsquo;re gonna go to the ballot box</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna vote.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna pick up their store</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna move it to the other side of town</p>
<p>or to another town altogether.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna keep their children away</p>
<p>from places where they think the influences</p>
<p>are harmful to those children.</p>
<p>They may not even talk about it in public.</p>
<p>You can believe that in private</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re talking about it with each other.</p>
<p>You had better find a more effective way</p>
<p>of dealing with the conflicts in this country</p>
<p>that fall along racial fault lines</p>
<p>than calling people witches,</p>
<p>which is what this, you know, anti racist,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a racist because you think</p>
<p>that the out of wedlock birth rate amongst black Americans</p>
<p>is seven babies out of 10 are born</p>
<p>to a woman without a husband.</p>
<p>Their families are falling apart.</p>
<p>Now, no one says that in public</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;d be called a racist</p>
<p>if they said it in public.</p>
<p>But as a matter of fact, the families are falling apart.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t change that in the least</p>
<p>by telling people to shut up about it.</p>
<p>Daniel Patrick Moynihan is called a racist</p>
<p>in the 1960s, the late Senator,</p>
<p>the New York Senator who was a federal employee</p>
<p>and an intellectual writing reports</p>
<p>and he writes a report about the Negro family,</p>
<p>he called it in those years.</p>
<p>If I use the word Negro,</p>
<p>now they&rsquo;re gonna call me a racist if I&rsquo;m a white person.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even use the word Negro,</p>
<p>which is a historically legitimate reference</p>
<p>to the descendants of the enslaved people,</p>
<p>which we were as black Americans proud to use until yesterday.</p>
<p>So all of this linguistic policing is a sign of weakness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s false black power.</p>
<p>People will seed you the ground.</p>
<p>Okay, you don&rsquo;t want me to use that word?</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t use that word anymore.</p>
<p>Okay, you don&rsquo;t want me to talk about that in public?</p>
<p>All right, I won&rsquo;t talk about it in public anymore.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna be called a racist, okay?</p>
<p>So I won&rsquo;t express my opinion.</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t changed anybody&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve also mentioned that for that,</p>
<p>you haven&rsquo;t changed anybody&rsquo;s mind,</p>
<p>but also for things like in universities and institutions,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a diversity inclusion</p>
<p>and equity kind of meetings and education and so on.</p>
<p>And I believe I read somewhere,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been, like I mentioned to you offline,</p>
<p>big fan of your Glenn show, people should listen to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also just interviews of you that I&rsquo;ve listened to.</p>
<p>I believe you mentioned somewhere</p>
<p>that even those kinds of meetings,</p>
<p>people might sit through and nod along,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that&rsquo;s making progress,</p>
<p>that they may actually be bottling up a frustration.</p>
<p>The fear is that that&rsquo;s going to result</p>
<p>in a pendulum sort of push back towards this idea</p>
<p>of forced appreciations, like forced anti racism kind of thing.</p>
<p>I talk about this often in my podcast,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the Glenn show, you can find the Glenn show</p>
<p>on my YouTube channel and also at Substack.</p>
<p>Yeah, you have a great Substack.</p>
<p>You and your friend do Q and As</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff on Patreon.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So yeah, so people should definitely follow you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a brilliant conversation.</p>
<p>Check us out.</p>
<p>But yeah, I mean, one concern is that the policing,</p>
<p>the superficial policing,</p>
<p>this is a part of political correctness,</p>
<p>the insistence that you only use certain words,</p>
<p>that you only talk in a certain way,</p>
<p>is a phony kind of power</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t actually persuade people</p>
<p>about the issues that are at hand.</p>
<p>Instead, it forces them underground</p>
<p>in their talk about these issues,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s problematic.</p>
<p>Much better that we have overt and explicit</p>
<p>and honest disagreement</p>
<p>to the extent that there are disagreement</p>
<p>about things that are going on</p>
<p>than that we have a superficial kind of conversation</p>
<p>that is purged of any real biting,</p>
<p>discomforting confrontation with the realities</p>
<p>of the situation at hand.</p>
<p>And for black Americans,</p>
<p>I think one big part of the reality</p>
<p>of the situation at hand is violent crime, violent crime.</p>
<p>A police officer is afraid when he stops the car</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s an 18 year old driver in the vehicle.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got dreadlocks.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a black person.</p>
<p>The car doesn&rsquo;t have the right license plate.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s afraid to deal with that person.</p>
<p>And one of the reasons he&rsquo;s afraid to deal with them</p>
<p>is because a few who look like him are behaving violently.</p>
<p>Their violence is usually perpetrated</p>
<p>against others who look like themselves, but not always.</p>
<p>And that reality doesn&rsquo;t get changed</p>
<p>by telling a newspaper writer who writes about it</p>
<p>that they are racist or enforcing within a newsroom.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t cover that story in that way</p>
<p>because to do so would be racist.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a monumental mistake</p>
<p>to enforce a closure on public discussion</p>
<p>based upon a calculation that if we allow people,</p>
<p>if Twitter allows this kind of post,</p>
<p>if the Washington Post runs this kind of story, et cetera,</p>
<p>you end up with a superficial politeness,</p>
<p>a superficial politeness,</p>
<p>but a subterranean seething resentment</p>
<p>that only makes matters worse.</p>
<p>If I can get your comment, maybe you have ideas</p>
<p>because it does seem that this kind of attack works</p>
<p>of being called a racist, being called, maybe not sexist,</p>
<p>but somebody, like we&rsquo;re going through a Johnny Depp trial</p>
<p>now, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a defamation trial, and the reason it&rsquo;s a defamation</p>
<p>trial is because all it took is a single accusation</p>
<p>of Johnny Depp being somebody who sexually</p>
<p>and physically abused Amber Heard.</p>
<p>And all it took is just a single article.</p>
<p>No proof was given except the accusation itself,</p>
<p>and the world believed it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s effective.</p>
<p>So how do you fight back if it&rsquo;s so damn effective</p>
<p>that you can just call anybody racist?</p>
<p>And it works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to wash off.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re not proven in the court of law</p>
<p>or anything like that, but we get those articles,</p>
<p>we get that label, and then the world moves on</p>
<p>and just assumes that person is racist.</p>
<p>So how do you, do you have any ideas how to fight back?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t, frankly.</p>
<p>Just highlighting the fact.</p>
<p>Listen, Roseanne Barr, who made this statement</p>
<p>about Valerie Jarrett, she made some kind of ape</p>
<p>like reference to the whatever, and her show</p>
<p>got canceled, and she&rsquo;s a racist.</p>
<p>So first of all, pointing it out, I suppose,</p>
<p>is one of the most powerful things that this,</p>
<p>the hypocrisy of it, the.</p>
<p>You say it works, I guess you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>It used to be that calling someone a communist worked.</p>
<p>I mean, going back to the late 40s, early 50s,</p>
<p>Red Scare, McCarthyism, and whatnot,</p>
<p>and the person might&rsquo;ve belonged to a club</p>
<p>that was pro Soviet Union in the 1930s</p>
<p>when they were in college.</p>
<p>They might&rsquo;ve voted for the socialist candidate,</p>
<p>Henry Wallace, in the presidential election of 1948.</p>
<p>They might belong to the Communist Party.</p>
<p>They might think Karl Marx was right about a whole lot</p>
<p>of stuff about capitalism and whatnot,</p>
<p>and they got called a communist or a Marxist,</p>
<p>and it could&rsquo;ve ruined their career,</p>
<p>could&rsquo;ve ruined their lives.</p>
<p>And a lot of people shut up about it,</p>
<p>and it took, and it went on for a long time.</p>
<p>And in a way, it kind of still is going on.</p>
<p>I mean, you call somebody a Marxist,</p>
<p>if you can make that stick, they&rsquo;re certainly not gonna</p>
<p>get elected president of the United States.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know about this.</p>
<p>I think, you know, I once read this book</p>
<p>by a German political scientist</p>
<p>called Elisabeth Neula Neumann.</p>
<p>That was the writer&rsquo;s name, Elisabeth Neula Neumann.</p>
<p>The book was called The Spiral of Silence.</p>
<p>And the argument was there can be some views,</p>
<p>some issues in society that get defined</p>
<p>in such a way that it&rsquo;s inappropriate to hold those views.</p>
<p>And as a result, people who don&rsquo;t want to be shamed,</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t want to be ostracized don&rsquo;t express those views.</p>
<p>And when they don&rsquo;t express them,</p>
<p>anybody holding the view because they don&rsquo;t hear it</p>
<p>said by others think that they&rsquo;re the only one</p>
<p>and one of the few who hold the view,</p>
<p>and so they don&rsquo;t want to be the only one</p>
<p>out there saying something, so they keep it to themselves.</p>
<p>So now this view, this attitude in society</p>
<p>could be held by a large number of people,</p>
<p>but because of the fear that if they were to express it,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d be ostracized, no one says it.</p>
<p>And since no one is saying it,</p>
<p>the others who hold the view don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not alone,</p>
<p>that they are not the only ones who hold the view.</p>
<p>And hence they keep silent.</p>
<p>That could be an equilibrium.</p>
<p>It could be a relatively stable situation</p>
<p>in which the emperor has no clothes.</p>
<p>Everybody can see that this dude is naked, okay?</p>
<p>But everybody thinks that, you know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be the only one to say it.</p>
<p>And so we all kind of collaborate in this charade</p>
<p>of keeping the view to ourselves.</p>
<p>Then along comes an event that somebody decides</p>
<p>to defy the consensus and to speak out.</p>
<p>It could be a little kid who in the story</p>
<p>about the emperor has no clothes,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t realize that he&rsquo;s not supposed to say</p>
<p>that the emperor is naked.</p>
<p>The thing about the kid in the story</p>
<p>who says that the emperor is naked,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that he&rsquo;s saying it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even that other people hear him saying it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that everybody knows</p>
<p>that everybody else heard him say it, okay?</p>
<p>The kid who speaks out and says the emperor has no clothes</p>
<p>creates a circumstance in which it&rsquo;s common knowledge</p>
<p>that the emperor has no clothes.</p>
<p>Now common knowledge does not just mean knowledge.</p>
<p>It does not even mean widespread knowledge.</p>
<p>It means comprehensive knowledge</p>
<p>of other person&rsquo;s knowledge of the thing, okay?</p>
<p>So the spiral of silence is a equilibrium</p>
<p>that is susceptible to being undermined</p>
<p>by a process of a kind of cumulative process,</p>
<p>a snowballing process of revelation</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not the only one who thinks this way, okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating to think that there&rsquo;s an ocean</p>
<p>of common knowledge that we&rsquo;re waiting for the little kid</p>
<p>to wake us up to, different little parts of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>And the little kid, by the way,</p>
<p>could be somebody like Donald Trump,</p>
<p>only more effective than Donald Trump,</p>
<p>somebody who is smarter than Donald Trump,</p>
<p>somebody who is shrewder than Donald Trump,</p>
<p>somebody who figures out that when Colin Kaepernick</p>
<p>takes a knee at a football game and says,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna stand for this president allegiance,</p>
<p>that a vast number of people are very unhappy about that.</p>
<p>Somebody who understands</p>
<p>that when a Black Lives Matter activist</p>
<p>stands up with his ball of fists and says,</p>
<p>burn this bitch down about a city</p>
<p>in the United States of America,</p>
<p>that a lot of people are upset about that, a lot of them.</p>
<p>A person, a shrewd politician,</p>
<p>a shrewd manager of a public image</p>
<p>could build on and create a circumstance</p>
<p>in which more and more people will feel safe</p>
<p>to express that view.</p>
<p>And the more who express it,</p>
<p>the safer those who have yet to express it but who hold it</p>
<p>will feel in expressing it.</p>
<p>And to the extent that the view is very widespread</p>
<p>but is kept under wraps, an explosion could happen.</p>
<p>And you can look up tomorrow and have a very different</p>
<p>country than you had today</p>
<p>because the conspiracy of silence, the spiral of silence</p>
<p>ends up getting unraveled by somebody who steps out</p>
<p>away from the consensus,</p>
<p>dares to take the slings and arrows</p>
<p>of exposing themselves as a naysayer</p>
<p>but taps into a sentiment that&rsquo;s very widespread.</p>
<p>And I fear that with respect to many racial issues,</p>
<p>this is the situation that we actually confront,</p>
<p>that it could unravel in a very ugly way.</p>
<p>But it could also unravel in a beautiful way.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s depending.</p>
<p>There is a spiral of silence, you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>and it could be, speaking of children,</p>
<p>charismatic children, there&rsquo;s a guy named Elon Musk</p>
<p>who might be a candidate for such an unraveling, right?</p>
<p>You mentioned the person that speaks out</p>
<p>could be a Donald Trump.</p>
<p>But in this current situation that we live in,</p>
<p>like as this week, Elon has purchased Twitter.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I hear.</p>
<p>And is pushing for, in all kinds of ways,</p>
<p>the increase of free speech on Twitter.</p>
<p>And speaking about some of the issues</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been speaking about here with you,</p>
<p>but maybe in broader strokes about just the fact</p>
<p>that you have to, it&rsquo;s okay to point out</p>
<p>that the emperor wears no clothes,</p>
<p>and to do so from all sides in a way</p>
<p>that everybody&rsquo;s a little bit pissed off,</p>
<p>but not too much.</p>
<p>What do you think about this whole effort</p>
<p>of free speech in these public platforms?</p>
<p>Elon in particular, Twitter, your avid Twitter user.</p>
<p>But just public platforms for discourse,</p>
<p>for us as a civilization to figure stuff out.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, the people on the left</p>
<p>are very upset about the possibility</p>
<p>that Elon Musk and Twitter will be open to,</p>
<p>more open to provocative public speech</p>
<p>that has heretofore been banned or suppressed.</p>
<p>And I think they might be right to be concerned</p>
<p>that that could happen.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know enough about the technology</p>
<p>and about the market to really,</p>
<p>I mean, social media and whatnot,</p>
<p>it seems like it&rsquo;s a complicated system</p>
<p>of interactions between people and who the users are</p>
<p>and so forth and so on.</p>
<p>I do know that that New York Post story</p>
<p>about Hunter Biden&rsquo;s laptop was real news</p>
<p>and could have affected the outcome of the election,</p>
<p>and it was suppressed,</p>
<p>and that Twitter had a role in suppressing it.</p>
<p>I do know that the question of where the COVID 19 virus</p>
<p>originated and the role that a lab leak account</p>
<p>could have played in the public processing of that event</p>
<p>was real news, and that it was suppressed</p>
<p>by people who were trying to control misinformation,</p>
<p>disinformation, Russian disinformation campaigns</p>
<p>and whatnot.</p>
<p>So Twitter has users, I&rsquo;m one of them,</p>
<p>and it has a lot of users.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as big as Facebook, I gather.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, but it&rsquo;s important,</p>
<p>the ability to construct counter platforms,</p>
<p>people moving around and whatnot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a kind of network dynamic</p>
<p>that maybe I should understand it better than I do</p>
<p>being a social scientist, but.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone understands it,</p>
<p>even people inside Twitter, which is fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a monster because of just the bandwidth of messaging,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t know who is a bot and who is a human.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fascinating dynamic,</p>
<p>and the viral nature of negativity.</p>
<p>All of those dynamics, of course,</p>
<p>you are probably the right person to understand it</p>
<p>from a social scientist perspective,</p>
<p>from an economics perspective,</p>
<p>but nobody really understands,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s fascinating within that domain,</p>
<p>how do you allow for free speech,</p>
<p>not allow for free speech, encourage free speech,</p>
<p>defend free speech, and at the same time,</p>
<p>manage millions of ongoing conversations</p>
<p>from just becoming insanely chaotic.</p>
<p>Sort of from Twitter perspective,</p>
<p>they want people to be happy, to grow,</p>
<p>to actually have difficult, critical conversations,</p>
<p>and the problem with humans is they think</p>
<p>they know what that is, and they think</p>
<p>they can label things as misinformation,</p>
<p>as counterproductive or healthy conversations, in quotes,</p>
<p>and the problem is, as we are learning,</p>
<p>humans are not able to do that effectively.</p>
<p>First of all, power corrupts.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something delicious about having the power</p>
<p>to label something as misinformation.</p>
<p>You do that once for something</p>
<p>that might be obviously misinformation,</p>
<p>and then you start getting greedy.</p>
<p>You start getting excited.</p>
<p>It feels good.</p>
<p>It feels good to label something</p>
<p>as misinformation or disinformation</p>
<p>that you just don&rsquo;t like, and over time,</p>
<p>especially if there&rsquo;s a culture inside of a company</p>
<p>that leans a certain political direction</p>
<p>or leans, in all the groups that we talked about,</p>
<p>leans a certain way, they&rsquo;ll start</p>
<p>to label as misinformation things they just don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>and that power is delicious, and it corrupts.</p>
<p>You have to construct mechanisms,</p>
<p>like the Founding Fathers did,</p>
<p>for somehow preventing you from allowing</p>
<p>that power to get too delicious.</p>
<p>At least that&rsquo;s my perspective on what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll just tell you personally,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited about the prospect.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad to see Musk making the move that he&rsquo;s making,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll see what happens at Twitter and so forth.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking forward for the, what did he say?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make Twitter more fun.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to the fun.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked about you are at a prestigious university.</p>
<p>Brown University.</p>
<p>Brown University, and you&rsquo;ve mentioned</p>
<p>that universities might be in trouble.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s with Jordan, but everywhere else,</p>
<p>that barbarians are at the gate.</p>
<p>Who are the barbarians at the gate of the university?</p>
<p>So first of all, what is to you beautiful</p>
<p>about the ideal of the university in America, of academia?</p>
<p>And what is a threat?</p>
<p>Well, you know, a university is dedicated</p>
<p>to the pursuit of truth, and to the education</p>
<p>and nurturing of young people as they enter</p>
<p>into the pursuit of truth, to doing research and to teaching</p>
<p>in a environment of free inquiry and civil discourse.</p>
<p>So free inquiry means you go wherever the evidence</p>
<p>and your imagination may lead you.</p>
<p>And civil discourse means that you exchange arguments</p>
<p>with people when you don&rsquo;t agree with them</p>
<p>on behalf of trying to get to the bottom of things.</p>
<p>I think the university is a magnificent institution.</p>
<p>It is a relatively modern institution.</p>
<p>I mean, last 500 years or so.</p>
<p>I mean, there are universities that are older than that,</p>
<p>but the great research universities of the world,</p>
<p>not only here in the United States,</p>
<p>are places where human ingenuity is nurtured,</p>
<p>where new lot knowledge is created,</p>
<p>and where young people are equipped to answer questions</p>
<p>that are open questions about our existence</p>
<p>in the world that we live in.</p>
<p>You can trace to the university much,</p>
<p>if not most, of the advances in technology</p>
<p>and resourcefulness and our understanding</p>
<p>of the origins of the species, of the nature of the universe,</p>
<p>cosmology, et cetera, science,</p>
<p>the pursuit of humanistic understanding,</p>
<p>the nurturing of traditions of inquiry,</p>
<p>so forth, so that&rsquo;s the university.</p>
<p>Barbarians are at the gates.</p>
<p>The people who are trying to shut down open inquiry</p>
<p>at the university on behalf of their particular view</p>
<p>about things are a threat to what the university stands for,</p>
<p>and they should be resisted.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m inquiring about the nature of human intelligence,</p>
<p>and I wanna study differences between human populations</p>
<p>and their acquisition of,</p>
<p>or their expression of cognitive ability,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fair game, it&rsquo;s an open question.</p>
<p>If I wanna know something about the nature</p>
<p>of gender affiliation and identity</p>
<p>and gender dysphoria and whatnot,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fair game to study in a university.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t shut that down, you shouldn&rsquo;t be able to,</p>
<p>by saying, I have a particular position here,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a member of a particular identity group,</p>
<p>suppose I wanna study the history of colonialism,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a narrative on the progressive side,</p>
<p>which is colonialism is about Europeans dominating</p>
<p>and stealing or whatever, whatever,</p>
<p>and I happen to think, well, there&rsquo;s another aspect</p>
<p>to the story about colonialism too,</p>
<p>which is that it&rsquo;s a mechanism for the diffusion</p>
<p>of the best in human civilization to populations</p>
<p>that were significantly lagging behind with respect to that.</p>
<p>It brought literacy to the Southern hemispheric populations</p>
<p>that were dominated in the process of the colonizing thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s complicated.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not taking that position, by the way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying somebody at a university</p>
<p>should be able to take it up and pursue it</p>
<p>and engage in argument with people about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about race and ethnicity,</p>
<p>but this extends to a wide range of things.</p>
<p>Suppose we&rsquo;re talking about race,</p>
<p>a wide range of things, suppose we&rsquo;re talking about climate,</p>
<p>and one person says the earth is endangered</p>
<p>because carbon in global warming, et cetera, et cetera,</p>
<p>and another person says, no, wait, no, wait,</p>
<p>look at where we stand in the 21st century.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re vastly richer than our ancestors just 250 years ago.</p>
<p>We have much more knowledge about that</p>
<p>and so forth and so on.</p>
<p>250 years from now, human ingenuity will have devised</p>
<p>in ways that we can not even begin to anticipate.</p>
<p>All manner of technological means for managing the problem.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason that we should shut down</p>
<p>industrial civilization today</p>
<p>because we fear the consequences of it</p>
<p>when in fact we are vastly richer than our ancestors</p>
<p>and those who come two centuries after us</p>
<p>will be vastly more effective</p>
<p>at dealing with problems than we are now.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s, et cetera.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not actually making that argument.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying the tendency to try to say, oh, no,</p>
<p>that person is a climate denier.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t pursue that area of inquiry</p>
<p>is against the spirit of the university.</p>
<p>I think the barbarians at the gates</p>
<p>has to do with the people who think they know</p>
<p>what the right side of history is</p>
<p>and try to make the university stand</p>
<p>on the right side of history.</p>
<p>My position is you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what the right side of history is.</p>
<p>And the purpose of a university is to equip you</p>
<p>to be able to think about what is the right side of history.</p>
<p>What is the solution to the dilemmas that confront us</p>
<p>as human beings living on this planet</p>
<p>with the billions that we are in the condition that we are.</p>
<p>So the identitarians,</p>
<p>the ones who wanna make the university kowtow</p>
<p>to their particular understandings about their own identity.</p>
<p>We now have at Brown University and various other places,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t do Columbus Day anymore.</p>
<p>We do Indigenous Peoples Day.</p>
<p>When that day comes up in October,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t talk about Columbus.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re taking down statues of Columbus</p>
<p>all across the country and so forth and so on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not arguing anything here other than</p>
<p>that the latter day position</p>
<p>BIPOCs, Black, Indigenous, and other people of color,</p>
<p>the latter day position that the university</p>
<p>has to reflect a particular sensibility</p>
<p>about these identity questions.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a threat to the integrity of the enterprise.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re overstating it.</p>
<p>I tend to be, just from my limited knowledge of MIT,</p>
<p>but perhaps it applies broadly,</p>
<p>I think the beauty of the university, broadly speaking,</p>
<p>is the faculty and the students.</p>
<p>And the problem arises from the overreach</p>
<p>of a overgrowing administration</p>
<p>that gives, again, thinks that it knows enough</p>
<p>to make rules and conclusions based on a set of beliefs,</p>
<p>and then based on that, empowers a certain small selection</p>
<p>of students to be the sort of voices of activism,</p>
<p>of a particular idea.</p>
<p>And not, I think activism is beautiful,</p>
<p>but not just activism, but anybody that disagrees</p>
<p>is shut down, and that, I think,</p>
<p>the blame lies with the administration.</p>
<p>So I think the solution is in lessening,</p>
<p>just like the solution with too big of a government,</p>
<p>too big of a bureaucracy, is there needs to be</p>
<p>redistribution of power to what makes universities beautiful,</p>
<p>which is the old students and the young students,</p>
<p>old students being professors.</p>
<p>So the scholars, the curious minds,</p>
<p>the people that are in this whole thing</p>
<p>to explore the world, to be curious about it,</p>
<p>on a salary that&rsquo;s probably way too low</p>
<p>for the thing they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole point.</p>
<p>And then the administration just gets in the way,</p>
<p>and is the source of this kind of,</p>
<p>I would say that, in your beautiful phrasing,</p>
<p>I would say the administration</p>
<p>is the barbarians at the gate.</p>
<p>So the solution is smaller bureaucracy,</p>
<p>smaller administrations.</p>
<p>I have to, on this point, you had this conversation,</p>
<p>you put on your self stack with Jordan Peterson</p>
<p>about cognitive inequality.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s titled Wrestling with Cognitive Inequality.</p>
<p>This particular topic of just IQ differences</p>
<p>between groups, why is this,</p>
<p>why is it so dangerous to talk about?</p>
<p>Why this particular topic?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re calling black people inferior.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re saying they&rsquo;re genetically inferior.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what people are saying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re rationalizing the disparity of outcomes</p>
<p>by reference to the intrinsic inferiority of black people.</p>
<p>If you say cognitive ability matters for social outcomes,</p>
<p>if you say cognitive ability exists,</p>
<p>people really are different</p>
<p>in terms of their intellectual functioning.</p>
<p>And if you say cognitive ability differences</p>
<p>are substantial between racially defined populations,</p>
<p>the sum of that, there is cognitive ability,</p>
<p>it matters, and the difference by race</p>
<p>is the conclusion that outcome differences by race</p>
<p>are in part due to natural differences</p>
<p>between the populations.</p>
<p>People find that to be completely offensive</p>
<p>and unacceptable.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I think is going on.</p>
<p>Can you steel me on that case</p>
<p>that we should be careful doing that kind of research?</p>
<p>So this has to do with research.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the Nazis used Nietzsche in their propaganda.</p>
<p>You can use, white supremacists could use conclusions,</p>
<p>cherry pick conclusions of studies to push their agenda.</p>
<p>Can you steel me on the case that we should be careful?</p>
<p>Yeah, I could do it at three levels.</p>
<p>One is what do we mean by cognitive ability?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s many different kinds of intelligence</p>
<p>a person might say.</p>
<p>How good are IQ tests at measuring</p>
<p>other kinds of human capacities</p>
<p>that are pertinent to success in life,</p>
<p>like temperament, like emotional intelligence, and so on.</p>
<p>So intelligence is not a one dimensional thing</p>
<p>measured by G.</p>
<p>The cognitive psychologists talk about G,</p>
<p>the general intelligence factor,</p>
<p>which is a statistical construction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a factor analytic resolution</p>
<p>of the correlation across individuals</p>
<p>in their performance on a battery,</p>
<p>a different kind of test.</p>
<p>And they use that to define a general factor of intelligence</p>
<p>that a person could say that is a very narrow view</p>
<p>of what human mental capacities actually are.</p>
<p>And that it&rsquo;s much better to think about</p>
<p>multi dimensional measures of human mental functioning</p>
<p>rather than a single cognitive ability measure,</p>
<p>so called IQ, which is a narrow construction</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t capture all of the subtle nuance</p>
<p>of human difference in functioning.</p>
<p>Functioning is not just the ability</p>
<p>to recite backwards a sequence of numbers.</p>
<p>I say eight, seven, nine, five, three, two.</p>
<p>You say two, three, five, seven, eight, nine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just that.</p>
<p>Intelligence is a complex management</p>
<p>of many different dimensions of human performance,</p>
<p>including things like being able to stick with a task</p>
<p>and not give up, things like being able to discipline</p>
<p>and control your impulses so as to remain focused</p>
<p>and so forth.</p>
<p>That could be one dimension.</p>
<p>I could start by questioning the very foundation</p>
<p>of the argument for racial differences in cognitive ability</p>
<p>by saying that your measure of cognitive ability is flawed.</p>
<p>I could go to a higher level.</p>
<p>I could say what we&rsquo;re really interested in</p>
<p>is social outcomes and the question of what factors</p>
<p>influence social outcomes extends well beyond mental ability</p>
<p>to many other things.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s an example.</p>
<p>Visual acuity, how well do you see?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not wearing glasses, I am.</p>
<p>Visual acuity varies between human beings.</p>
<p>Some people see better than other people do.</p>
<p>Visual acuity can be measured.</p>
<p>I can put you at the chart and you can,</p>
<p>can you identify and read that bottom line</p>
<p>in small print or not?</p>
<p>So we can measure visual acuity</p>
<p>and it varies between human beings.</p>
<p>Visual acuity is partly genetic.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s undoubtedly true.</p>
<p>We inherit genes that influence whether or not</p>
<p>we are nearsighted or farsighted or astigmatic or whatever.</p>
<p>So visual acuity differs between people</p>
<p>and can be measured and is under genetic control.</p>
<p>On the other hand, corrective lenses allow for us</p>
<p>to level the playing field between people</p>
<p>who are differently endowed in terms of visual acuity.</p>
<p>Likewise, social outcomes are what we&rsquo;re really interested in</p>
<p>employment, earnings, whether or not they&rsquo;re law abiding,</p>
<p>how do they conduct themselves and their families</p>
<p>and so forth amongst individuals.</p>
<p>Yes, social outcomes are influenced</p>
<p>by so called cognitive ability,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re influenced by many other things as well.</p>
<p>If there are interventions that can be undertaken in society</p>
<p>that level the playing field between people</p>
<p>who have different natural endowments of cognitive ability,</p>
<p>the fact that people or groups differ in cognitive ability</p>
<p>becomes less significant.</p>
<p>Just like it&rsquo;s less significant that people differ</p>
<p>with respect to how well they see</p>
<p>when corrective lenses allow</p>
<p>for the leveling of that playing field.</p>
<p>There are in fact interventions, educational interventions,</p>
<p>early childhood interventions that have been shown</p>
<p>to level the playing field</p>
<p>to create better life outcomes for people</p>
<p>even if they happen to be endowed with low intelligence.</p>
<p>So a second level of arguing against this whole program</p>
<p>of research on human differences and intelligence</p>
<p>is to observe that yes, human beings</p>
<p>and perhaps racially defined groups</p>
<p>may differ on the average in intellectual endowment,</p>
<p>but there well may be social interventions</p>
<p>that level the playing field,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s in education</p>
<p>or in other kinds of programmatic interventions,</p>
<p>especially for the poor.</p>
<p>A final level of argument is the one that you alluded to,</p>
<p>which is that if you talk like this,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna encourage a kind of politics</p>
<p>which is very ugly.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s best to frame the discussion</p>
<p>in ways that don&rsquo;t put emphasis</p>
<p>on racially defined natural differences between populations.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an argument that I am myself personally</p>
<p>conflicted about.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I think, you know,</p>
<p>those people are just stupid.</p>
<p>It is racist, okay?</p>
<p>On the other hand, I think the calculation,</p>
<p>we shouldn&rsquo;t do this kind of research.</p>
<p>Suppose I&rsquo;m at the National Science Foundation,</p>
<p>a research team submits a proposal.</p>
<p>The proposal proposes to undertake a study.</p>
<p>The study would explore the extent to which people</p>
<p>and racial groups differ with respect</p>
<p>to their intellectual performance</p>
<p>and how that&rsquo;s influenced by their genetic</p>
<p>and environmental interaction.</p>
<p>And I decide not to fund the study</p>
<p>based on a political calculation</p>
<p>that the subject is too sensitive.</p>
<p>And if you explore that subject,</p>
<p>you might get the wrong answer.</p>
<p>And if you get the wrong answer,</p>
<p>the white supremacist will be encouraged.</p>
<p>Well, that is presuming before the research is done</p>
<p>that I know the outcome of the research</p>
<p>and that I can calculate what the political consequence</p>
<p>of the research outcome is gonna be.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s assuming the thing before you even know</p>
<p>what the thing actually is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a kind of omniscience.</p>
<p>It presumes that you as the master of the universe</p>
<p>can tell people what it is</p>
<p>that people are being treated like children,</p>
<p>what it is that they&rsquo;re capable of knowing</p>
<p>and what it is that they&rsquo;re not capable of knowing.</p>
<p>It would be like someone saying to Einstein,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about that special relativity theory.</p>
<p>You know, it could well lead</p>
<p>to the development of technologies</p>
<p>that would allow nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Or someone saying to Oppenheimer,</p>
<p>who is a physicist overseeing the Manhattan Project</p>
<p>where the US developed a nuclear weapons capacity,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t carry out that project</p>
<p>because the results of acquiring that knowledge</p>
<p>may be more than we can deal with.</p>
<p>Or someone saying to someone doing biomedical research</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s interested in exploring the nature of the human genome,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t carry out that experiment,</p>
<p>that cloning, undertaking, whatever,</p>
<p>because the consequences could be deleterious.</p>
<p>Well, the consequences could be deleterious.</p>
<p>The consequences could also be the cure of cancer.</p>
<p>The consequences could also be</p>
<p>being able to generate electric power</p>
<p>without producing carbon effluent.</p>
<p>So who are you to tell me,</p>
<p>you being the person in the political position</p>
<p>to control the research,</p>
<p>what the consequence of doing the research is?</p>
<p>I think I don&rsquo;t want to cede that kind of power</p>
<p>to politicians over the course of human inquiry.</p>
<p>So yes, I would want there to be regulations</p>
<p>governing the use of biologically sensitive</p>
<p>and potentially dangerous pathogens</p>
<p>in a lab in Wuhan or any place else.</p>
<p>I would not want to simply leave that to laissez faire.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I think that the tendency</p>
<p>to try to shut down inquiry</p>
<p>on behalf of supposed adverse political consequences</p>
<p>is the road to ignorance and impoverishment</p>
<p>at the end of the day for humankind,</p>
<p>denying ourselves the potential benefits</p>
<p>of that kind of inquiry.</p>
<p>I think we need to take our chances with inquiry</p>
<p>rather than to try to control it.</p>
<p>And I feel that way about the exploration</p>
<p>of human intelligence as much as anything else.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve asked me to steel man the case</p>
<p>against research on IQ of the sort</p>
<p>that Charles Murray is famous for popularizing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve said A, your measure of intelligence</p>
<p>is single dimensional and it ought to be multi dimensional.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said B, the consequences of people&rsquo;s differing</p>
<p>in intelligence depends not only</p>
<p>on the natural endowments of the people</p>
<p>but also on the environment</p>
<p>and the potential for intervening in that environment</p>
<p>through one or another kind of instrument</p>
<p>as the metaphorical example of the use of corrective lenses</p>
<p>to level the playing field between people</p>
<p>with different visual acuity indicates.</p>
<p>But finally, I&rsquo;ve said, yes,</p>
<p>research on racial differences in IQ can foster</p>
<p>political beliefs that we would regard to be noxious.</p>
<p>On the other hand, to presume that what we don&rsquo;t know yet</p>
<p>and might find out from the research is gonna be harmful</p>
<p>is to assume a kind of presumption</p>
<p>or of knowing what the outcome of unknown processes might be</p>
<p>which we ought to be very slow to embrace</p>
<p>because if we had done so in the past,</p>
<p>we wouldn&rsquo;t have nuclear power.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things that we wouldn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, what were people saying about Darwin</p>
<p>and exploration of the evolution</p>
<p>and origin of the species?</p>
<p>They were afraid that it was gonna, in effect,</p>
<p>disprove the religious based accounts</p>
<p>of what were they saying about Copernicus</p>
<p>and et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>So, you know.</p>
<p>That was a masterful layering of, quote,</p>
<p>wrestling with cognitive inequality.</p>
<p>You dragged in nuclear research,</p>
<p>Copernicus, Darwin, biomedical research with genetics,</p>
<p>even COVID and the lab leak.</p>
<p>I mean, that was just fun to listen to.</p>
<p>Okay. Okay.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about your politics.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve recently said that you&rsquo;re a conservative leaning.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe that&rsquo;s a day to day thing.</p>
<p>Maybe you can push back.</p>
<p>But so you have somebody like your friend, John McWhorter,</p>
<p>who we could say is on your left, to the left of you.</p>
<p>And then you have somebody like Thomas Sowell</p>
<p>who maybe is on to the right of you.</p>
<p>Yeah, probably.</p>
<p>And yet there&rsquo;s a lot of overlap between the three of you.</p>
<p>So to what degree does politics affect your view on race</p>
<p>in America?</p>
<p>And maybe to what degree does your view on race</p>
<p>affect your politics?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And that, for people who don&rsquo;t know, has shifted over time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been on quite a roller coaster,</p>
<p>as anybody who thinks about the world should be.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s begin with the fact that I was trained</p>
<p>as an economist in a tradition of what many people</p>
<p>would call neoliberalism.</p>
<p>I was trained at MIT, which was not a right wing place</p>
<p>by any means, but it was a place where you learned</p>
<p>about markets and about the benefits of capitalism</p>
<p>as a way of organizing society,</p>
<p>the virtues of free enterprise,</p>
<p>the fact that the pursuit of profit</p>
<p>was not necessarily a bad thing,</p>
<p>but it well might be the road to prosperity</p>
<p>and to economic growth.</p>
<p>The idea that private property and individuals seeking</p>
<p>to acquire and succeeding in acquiring wealth</p>
<p>did create inequality, but it also created opportunity.</p>
<p>And it also expanded the ability to do things</p>
<p>and expanded our knowledge and our control</p>
<p>over the physical environment in which we&rsquo;re embedded</p>
<p>and et cetera.</p>
<p>So we were not Marxists at MIT, although we did read Marx.</p>
<p>I mean, those of us who were intellectually curious,</p>
<p>you read Marx.</p>
<p>Marx was an important figure in the history of the West.</p>
<p>And I think Marx should be read in capital three volumes,</p>
<p>et cetera, alienation of labor and whatnot.</p>
<p>The implications of modernization,</p>
<p>the advent of industrial capitalism, et cetera.</p>
<p>That kind of dynamic deserves to be studied</p>
<p>and to come at it in a critical way,</p>
<p>informed by the intellectual inheritance of Marx and Marxism.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a part of a full education</p>
<p>in social philosophy and economic analysis</p>
<p>that an open minded person ought to acquaint themselves with.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day,</p>
<p>I think that the free marketeers have the better of it.</p>
<p>I think the story of the 20th century</p>
<p>as far as economic development is concerned reflects that.</p>
<p>I think that the experiments where centralized control</p>
<p>over economic decisions was the order of the day failed.</p>
<p>I think that the fact of the 21st century rise of China</p>
<p>as a force has a lot to do with the spread of,</p>
<p>in effect, capitalist oriented modes</p>
<p>of entering economic exchange,</p>
<p>freeing up prices, markets, property, and so forth.</p>
<p>Although obviously it&rsquo;s a complicated</p>
<p>political economic system, we&rsquo;re talking about China.</p>
<p>But I think that the story of the 20th century</p>
<p>and the hope for the 21st century</p>
<p>is that prosperity is enhanced through the free exchange</p>
<p>of goods and the pursuit and acquisition of property</p>
<p>by people in a more or less capitalist oriented system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the view that I hold.</p>
<p>I guess that makes me a conservative, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I wanna say that&rsquo;s not to the exclusion</p>
<p>of a social safety net.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that old people in an ideal social system</p>
<p>would be left to their own devices</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not</p>
<p>they had saved for their retirement.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that the ideal of extending decent access</p>
<p>to healthcare to all people regardless</p>
<p>of whether or not they can afford it,</p>
<p>decent access to education to people</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not they can afford it</p>
<p>is standing in the way of prosperity.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that.</p>
<p>I think the mixed economies that we see in Northern Europe</p>
<p>and in North America are a balancing</p>
<p>of the virtues of free enterprise property</p>
<p>and the pursuit of wealth on the one hand</p>
<p>against the needs to have a decent society</p>
<p>in which people who fall between the cracks nevertheless</p>
<p>are bolstered through a sense of social solidarity</p>
<p>that is accommodated by our common membership</p>
<p>within a single nation state,</p>
<p>which is why I think nationalism is important.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s why I think borders are important</p>
<p>because without a coherent polity</p>
<p>who can see themselves as in a common situation</p>
<p>and agree through their politics</p>
<p>to support each other to some extent,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t sustain a safety net.</p>
<p>You cannot have a social safety net for a global population.</p>
<p>You can only have a social safety net</p>
<p>for a bounded population who have a sense</p>
<p>of common membership in an ongoing political enterprise</p>
<p>which they pay their dues through their taxes</p>
<p>in order to sustain it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a balancing that has to go on.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first thing that I would say about my politics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a neoliberal economist.</p>
<p>I believe in markets.</p>
<p>I believe in prices.</p>
<p>I believe in profit.</p>
<p>Corporations are not an incarnation of evil.</p>
<p>Corporations are a legal nexus</p>
<p>through which production gets organized</p>
<p>in which you solicit the cooperation of workers,</p>
<p>of people who provide capital,</p>
<p>of people who provide raw materials</p>
<p>and input of customers and so on.</p>
<p>And that functionality allows for the production of goods</p>
<p>and their distribution and their earning of income</p>
<p>and its distribution,</p>
<p>which at the end of the day is the foundation</p>
<p>of our prosperity.</p>
<p>Corporations are people too.</p>
<p>Mitt Romney got in trouble for saying that in 2012.</p>
<p>But corporations are nothing but a legal fiction.</p>
<p>The corporation is not a person as such,</p>
<p>but the nexus of contracts and relationships</p>
<p>amongst the stakeholders who intersect</p>
<p>in the context of the corporation</p>
<p>is the way in which we organize</p>
<p>the massively complex set of activities</p>
<p>that are necessary in order to produce economic benefits,</p>
<p>in order to feed people,</p>
<p>in order to have everybody with a cell phone in their pocket,</p>
<p>in order to be able to travel from one side of a continent</p>
<p>to another on a device that is with almost absolute certainty</p>
<p>gonna safely take off and land</p>
<p>and in order to be able to build cities and et cetera.</p>
<p>But do the markets, the ideal of the market</p>
<p>collide with the ideal of all men are created equal?</p>
<p>The identity, the struggle that we&rsquo;ve been talking about</p>
<p>of what it means to sort of empower humans</p>
<p>that make up this great country.</p>
<p>Do they collide and where do they collide?</p>
<p>Well, markets are gonna produce inequality</p>
<p>and all men being equal is a statement</p>
<p>about the intrinsic worth of people,</p>
<p>not about the situation that will come about</p>
<p>when people interact with each other through markets</p>
<p>because people are actually different</p>
<p>and because there are factors</p>
<p>that are beyond anybody&rsquo;s control called luck and chance</p>
<p>that you and I both invest.</p>
<p>It looked a priori like your investment and my investment</p>
<p>were equally likely to succeed.</p>
<p>But as a matter of fact, ex post facto,</p>
<p>your investment succeeds, my investment doesn&rsquo;t succeed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have wealth and you have wealth.</p>
<p>That is an inevitable consequence of a environment</p>
<p>in which both of us are free to make our investment choices</p>
<p>and where the consequences of investment</p>
<p>depend in part upon random circumstances</p>
<p>of which no one has control.</p>
<p>But you asked me about my politics</p>
<p>and I was just trying to lay down a foundation</p>
<p>by saying I begin as an economist</p>
<p>in the tradition of liberalism, Adam Smith and so forth,</p>
<p>John Maynard Keynes for that matter and so forth,</p>
<p>that Milton Friedman and so forth,</p>
<p>that Paul Samuelson, Bob Solla, James Tobin and so forth,</p>
<p>Thomas Sowell, yes, that appreciates property,</p>
<p>the virtues of free enterprise,</p>
<p>the set of institutions that allow for security of contract,</p>
<p>a rule of law, things of this kind.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one thing to say about my politics.</p>
<p>Another thing to say about my politics and you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve moved around, is that I began south side of Chicago,</p>
<p>black kid, I was a liberal Democrat.</p>
<p>I encountered the economics curriculum at the MIT</p>
<p>and I became trained in economics</p>
<p>in the tradition that I&rsquo;ve just described.</p>
<p>And I encountered also the Reagan Revolution.</p>
<p>This is the late 70s and early 80s.</p>
<p>These are big debates about economic policy and so on.</p>
<p>And I found a lot to admire in the supply side errors,</p>
<p>the people were saying,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get the government out of the way,</p>
<p>the people who were worried about national debt,</p>
<p>which is a lot more now than it was then,</p>
<p>the people who were worried</p>
<p>that the welfare state could be too big,</p>
<p>that the incentives of transfer programs</p>
<p>could be counterproductive, that you had a war on poverty</p>
<p>and we did have a war on poverty and poverty won.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I found.</p>
<p>And we did have a war on poverty and poverty won.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of evidence that the war on poverty</p>
<p>was lost by the people who were trying to, quote unquote,</p>
<p>eradicate poverty in our time.</p>
<p>That incentives really do matter</p>
<p>and that the state, which is driven by politics,</p>
<p>is often unresponsive to the dictates of incentives.</p>
<p>Whereas markets eliminate people who are inefficient</p>
<p>and who are not cognizant of the consequences of incentives</p>
<p>because they can&rsquo;t cover their bottom line</p>
<p>and they won&rsquo;t persist for very long.</p>
<p>If they can&rsquo;t cover their bottom line,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re forced to respond to the realities of differences</p>
<p>and costs and benefits and so forth</p>
<p>in a way that governments can cover</p>
<p>because they have their hand in our pocket.</p>
<p>They can cover their losses</p>
<p>and they can make accounts balanced,</p>
<p>not withstanding their mistakes</p>
<p>because they can take my property by fiat,</p>
<p>by the power of the state, the tax collector comes,</p>
<p>if I don&rsquo;t pay, he seizes my holdings.</p>
<p>And they can carry on in that way.</p>
<p>They need the corrective influence of markets</p>
<p>in order to be responsive to the realities of life.</p>
<p>I mean, I may not like it that prices are telling me</p>
<p>that something that I wanna do is infeasible.</p>
<p>I may not like it, but what the prices are telling me</p>
<p>is that the costs of doing it exceed the benefits</p>
<p>to be derived from doing it.</p>
<p>And if I persist in doing it not withstanding that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna run losses.</p>
<p>And those losses will accumulate.</p>
<p>And the net effect of that over an entire society</p>
<p>is stagnation and ultimate attenuation</p>
<p>of the economic benefits</p>
<p>that might be available to people.</p>
<p>Again, I think if you look at the developing world</p>
<p>in the postcolonial period,</p>
<p>the second half of the 20th century,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s exactly what you see.</p>
<p>Planning doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Centralized control over resource allocation doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Okay, so I became more conservative in that respect,</p>
<p>but I also, and this has to do with race,</p>
<p>lost the faith in the posture</p>
<p>that what became of the civil rights movement.</p>
<p>I mean, the civil rights movement, you quote King 1963,</p>
<p>the civil rights movement starts out as</p>
<p>we want equal membership in the polity,</p>
<p>but it becomes a systematized cover I&rsquo;m going to argue</p>
<p>for deficiencies that are discernible</p>
<p>within black American society, which only we could correct.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very controversial statement.</p>
<p>I make it with trepidation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t take any pleasure in saying it,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m talking about the family.</p>
<p>So the family is a matter internal to the community</p>
<p>about how men and women relate to each other</p>
<p>and engage in social reproduction, childbearing,</p>
<p>the standing up of households,</p>
<p>the context within which children are developed,</p>
<p>are maturing and so forth and so on.</p>
<p>So the African American family is in trouble.</p>
<p>I think I can demonstrate that</p>
<p>by reference to high rates of marital dissolution,</p>
<p>by high rates of birth to out of wedlock and so forth.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t even say that</p>
<p>the African American family is in trouble.</p>
<p>Violence, homicide is an order of magnitude more prevalent</p>
<p>amongst African Americans than it is</p>
<p>in the society as a whole.</p>
<p>This is behavior, it&rsquo;s behavior of our people.</p>
<p>I speak of black people.</p>
<p>Of course, we&rsquo;re not the only people in society</p>
<p>for whom violence is an issue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an order of magnitude more prevalent in our communities.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about schooling and school failure.</p>
<p>So we have affirmative action as a cover.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bandaid on differences in the development</p>
<p>of intellectual performance,</p>
<p>which is only partly a consequence</p>
<p>of the natural intelligence of people</p>
<p>and largely a consequence of how people spend their time,</p>
<p>what they value, how they discipline themselves,</p>
<p>what they do with their opportunities,</p>
<p>how parents raise their children,</p>
<p>what peer groups value and things of this kind.</p>
<p>The Asian students who are scoring off the charts</p>
<p>on these exams are doing it</p>
<p>not because they&rsquo;re intrinsically more intelligent</p>
<p>to other people, but because they work harder,</p>
<p>because their parents are more insistent</p>
<p>on focusing on their intellectual performance</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re disciplined,</p>
<p>because of the way that they devote their time</p>
<p>and their resources to equipping their children</p>
<p>to function in the 21st century.</p>
<p>This is what I believe.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s demonstrably the case.</p>
<p>And it is a factor in racial disparity.</p>
<p>The way that the civil rights movement has evolved</p>
<p>under the wing of the Democratic Party</p>
<p>into an organized apologia for the failures</p>
<p>of African Americans to seize the opportunities</p>
<p>that exist for us now in the 21st century,</p>
<p>but did not exist in the first half of the 20th century,</p>
<p>the way in which the civil rights movement</p>
<p>has become an avoidance mechanism</p>
<p>for us not taking we African Americans responsible.</p>
<p>This is Glenn Loury.</p>
<p>Not everybody&rsquo;s gonna agree with it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of what makes me a conservative.</p>
<p>I am tired of the bellyaching.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tired of the excuse me, white supremacy.</p>
<p>It is in my mind, a joke.</p>
<p>I lament the fact that that kind of rhetoric</p>
<p>is so seductively attractive to African Americans</p>
<p>and so widely adopted by others.</p>
<p>And as I am fond of saying, at the end of the day,</p>
<p>nobody is coming to save us.</p>
<p>I mean, higher education, MIT, Caltech, Stanford,</p>
<p>where the future is happening,</p>
<p>that is about mastery over the achievements</p>
<p>of human civilization, such as they manifest themselves</p>
<p>in the 21st century.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no substitute for actually acquiring mastery</p>
<p>over the material.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no substitute for that to be patronized,</p>
<p>to have the standards lowered.</p>
<p>They wanna get rid of the test.</p>
<p>They wanna tell African Americans to pat us on the head.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna have a separate program for you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna give you a side door that you can come into.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t make us any smarter.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make us any more creative.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t make us any more fit</p>
<p>for the actual competition that&rsquo;s unfolding before us.</p>
<p>Now, you wanna be 10% of the population</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s carried along for the next 100 years?</p>
<p>You wanna be a ward of the state in the late 21st century?</p>
<p>You go ahead.</p>
<p>Because the Chinese are coming.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna hold them back.</p>
<p>The world is being remade every decade</p>
<p>by new ways of seeing and new ways of doing.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t get on board with the dynamic advancement</p>
<p>of the civilization in which we are embedded,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna end up being dependent on other people</p>
<p>to look kindly upon you.</p>
<p>And this story that you&rsquo;ve got, this bellyache,</p>
<p>this excuse, my ancestors were slaves,</p>
<p>is only gonna work for so long.</p>
<p>So that makes me, I suppose, a kind of conservative.</p>
<p>I hate affirmative action.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t just disagree with it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t just think it&rsquo;s against the 14th amendment.</p>
<p>I hate it.</p>
<p>The hatred comes from an understanding</p>
<p>that it is a bandaid, that it is a substitute</p>
<p>for the actual development of the capacities</p>
<p>of our people to compete.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d much rather be in the position</p>
<p>of having them try to keep me out</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m so damn good,</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re doing with the Asians,</p>
<p>than having them have to beg the Supreme Court</p>
<p>to allow for a special dispensation on my behalf</p>
<p>because they need diversity and inclusion and belonging.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just diversity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s diversity and inclusion and belonging.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m whining because I feel like I don&rsquo;t belong.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a position of weakness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pathetic.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only political correctness</p>
<p>that keeps people who can see this,</p>
<p>and believe me, a lot of people can see it</p>
<p>from saying so out loud.</p>
<p>So you want the black American community</p>
<p>to represent strength.</p>
<p>Correct, and I want us to deal with what it is</p>
<p>that we have to deal with in order to be able</p>
<p>to project strength in an increasingly competitive world.</p>
<p>Let me ask you,</p>
<p>I know you said you&rsquo;re angry</p>
<p>or dislike affirmative action.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about something</p>
<p>that even to my ear cut wrong.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m relatively apolitical.</p>
<p>So President Biden, when he was running for president,</p>
<p>gave a campaign promise that he will nominate</p>
<p>a black woman to the US Supreme Court,</p>
<p>saying, quote, the person I will nominate</p>
<p>will be someone with extraordinary qualifications,</p>
<p>character, experience, and integrity.</p>
<p>First sentence.</p>
<p>Second sentence.</p>
<p>And that person will be the first black woman</p>
<p>ever nominated to the United States Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Do you wish he only said the first sentence</p>
<p>and not the second?</p>
<p>Yes, I wish that he had only said the first sentence,</p>
<p>even if his intention was to do</p>
<p>what he said he was gonna do in the second sentence.</p>
<p>In other words, I wish that he had simply said,</p>
<p>if I have the opportunity to nominate someone</p>
<p>to the Supreme Court, it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>a superbly qualified person to carry out that position.</p>
<p>And he might&rsquo;ve kept to himself his intention</p>
<p>to name an African American woman to that position.</p>
<p>And then going ahead and named an African American woman</p>
<p>to that position.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure that Katanji Brown Jackson,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t doubt that she&rsquo;s exceptionally qualified.</p>
<p>She has a distinguished career.</p>
<p>She served as a judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a graduate at Harvard Law School.</p>
<p>She has a background.</p>
<p>You do not have to be a world class</p>
<p>constitutional legal scholar</p>
<p>to get onto the United States Supreme Court.</p>
<p>A lot of members of the United States Supreme Court</p>
<p>have had different kinds of legal careers</p>
<p>before they were elevated to that position.</p>
<p>Earl Warren of the famed Warren Court of the 1950s and 60s</p>
<p>was a politician as well as a leading jurist and whatnot.</p>
<p>I mean, many kinds of people in the US Supreme Court.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that Judge Katanji Brown Jackson</p>
<p>is a qualified member to be on the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>I wish that Biden had not done what he did.</p>
<p>He could have just appointed a black woman</p>
<p>by saying that he was limiting his considerations</p>
<p>to black women.</p>
<p>And what are black women as a percentage</p>
<p>of all potential appointees to the Supreme Court?</p>
<p>3%, 4%, I don&rsquo;t know, we could look the number up.</p>
<p>By saying that he puts an asterisk on the appointment,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s worse than that</p>
<p>because she will live down the asterisk</p>
<p>if a person is inclined to do that.</p>
<p>She will have the opportunity to show</p>
<p>through her performance exactly what kind of juror she is.</p>
<p>Just as Justice Clarence Thomas has shown</p>
<p>through his performance that he was qualified</p>
<p>and more than qualified to be</p>
<p>on the United States Supreme Court,</p>
<p>what I dislike was the pandering.</p>
<p>He was seeking votes from black people by pandering to us</p>
<p>and then he&rsquo;s treating us like children.</p>
<p>Why should I care what color the person is</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s on the United States Supreme Court?</p>
<p>What I should care about is what kind of opinions</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna write when they&rsquo;re on the United States.</p>
<p>Do I suppose that being a black woman</p>
<p>means that you&rsquo;re gonna write different kinds</p>
<p>of opinions than others?</p>
<p>Well, perhaps, perhaps that kind of identity politics</p>
<p>at the highest level of American legal establishment</p>
<p>is something that rubs me very much the wrong way.</p>
<p>What I should care about is the nature</p>
<p>and the future of the law.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m actually struck by this</p>
<p>because the court is conservative.</p>
<p>It has six conservative members on it</p>
<p>and it has three liberal members on it.</p>
<p>And if I were and I&rsquo;m not a liberal Democrat,</p>
<p>the highest concern that I would have</p>
<p>about an appointment to the Supreme Court is,</p>
<p>is this a person who is going to be effective</p>
<p>in advocating my liberal views</p>
<p>within the highest counsel of American law?</p>
<p>Now, the fact that that person is a woman</p>
<p>or is a black person is way down the list</p>
<p>of the things that I would think are important</p>
<p>to the kinds of opinions that they&rsquo;re going to write.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I think Joe Biden,</p>
<p>this is just a piece of a larger political strategy</p>
<p>to cobble together a coalition</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll be successful at the polls</p>
<p>in sustaining Democrats.</p>
<p>Jim Crow 2.0, this whole characterization</p>
<p>of the conflict in the states</p>
<p>about election security and voting rights</p>
<p>is another part of that strategy.</p>
<p>He is pandering to black voters.</p>
<p>He is trying to frighten us,</p>
<p>thinking that if the Republicans win,</p>
<p>our rights will be taken away.</p>
<p>And I think it is a infantilization</p>
<p>of African American politics.</p>
<p>I think black people are not to be as concerned</p>
<p>about the color of the skin of a person</p>
<p>who is serving in government</p>
<p>as they are about the content of their character</p>
<p>and the focus of their political</p>
<p>and ideological orientation,</p>
<p>which for me would be center or even center right,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s me.</p>
<p>And it should not have a significant impact.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he said she can overcome the asterisks,</p>
<p>but to me it was deeply disrespectful</p>
<p>that anyone would give an extra asterisk</p>
<p>to have to overcome.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have to say it.</p>
<p>All he had to do was do it.</p>
<p>If he wanted to put a black woman on the court,</p>
<p>then he could have gone ahead and done it.</p>
<p>The reason he said it is because he wanted black people</p>
<p>to vote for him by saying it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m saying that treats us like we&rsquo;re children.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a political statement.</p>
<p>I just thought as a leader,</p>
<p>that was kind of disgusting.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about Thomas Sowell.</p>
<p>You mentioned him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a colleague and somebody who was an influence</p>
<p>in the space of ideas.</p>
<p>So what broadly, what impact has he had on your ideas</p>
<p>and how do you think he shaped the landscape of ideas</p>
<p>in our culture in general?</p>
<p>I think Thomas Sowell, he&rsquo;s in his 90s now.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been around for a long time.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s still got it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s still going at it.</p>
<p>Books continue to come out.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s a great man.</p>
<p>I think Thomas Sowell, regardless of his race,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s black, is one of the 100 most significant economists</p>
<p>of the 20th century.</p>
<p>He has chosen as his subject,</p>
<p>a substantial part of his subject,</p>
<p>subject to investigate the deep causes</p>
<p>and consequences of racial disparity of one kind or another.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s written fundamental books about that, many of them.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a social philosopher.</p>
<p>He is a economic historian.</p>
<p>He is a combatant in the conflict of ideas</p>
<p>around how to think about society</p>
<p>and this beyond racial differences,</p>
<p>although race has been a big part</p>
<p>of what he&rsquo;s written about.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been critical of affirmative action</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t just stand back and wag his finger.</p>
<p>He got busy looking at the consequences</p>
<p>of affirmative action in societies all around the world.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s written books about that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been critical of the narrative about civil rights</p>
<p>and racial inequality.</p>
<p>He believes in small government.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t think that efforts to redistribute income</p>
<p>have proved to be the solution</p>
<p>to the problem of racial disparity.</p>
<p>Tom has not been honored by the committee</p>
<p>that hands out Nobel recognition in economic science</p>
<p>and probably won&rsquo;t be because he&rsquo;s controversial.</p>
<p>And I reckon that that committee would be loath to encourage</p>
<p>the blowback that they would be sure to receive</p>
<p>if they were to take a controversial</p>
<p>and politically focus and expressive black conservative</p>
<p>and honor in that way.</p>
<p>So I think another reason is that Tom</p>
<p>as a methodological matter is not especially quantitative.</p>
<p>He pays attention to data</p>
<p>but he doesn&rsquo;t do statistical analysis</p>
<p>and he doesn&rsquo;t do modeling.</p>
<p>So from a methodological point of view,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not a cutting edge kind of person</p>
<p>of mathematically sophisticated,</p>
<p>kind of quantitatively statistically oriented</p>
<p>but he does descriptive stuff.</p>
<p>He writes in a style that is much more</p>
<p>like a social historian than it is</p>
<p>like a mathematically trained analytical economist.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he is an economist in the Chicago school</p>
<p>with Milton Friedman and George Stickler</p>
<p>prominent amongst his teachers who takes price theory</p>
<p>which is the analysis of the interplay of market forces,</p>
<p>mindful of incentives and so on</p>
<p>to implement the basic insights from economic science.</p>
<p>There is no free lunch.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s always gonna be a cost</p>
<p>to anything that you do and so on.</p>
<p>People respond to incentives, demand curves slope downward.</p>
<p>Competition tends to work best</p>
<p>when people are free to enter and not and so on.</p>
<p>I mean, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>But Tom is also a social historian and a philosopher</p>
<p>in the tradition of Friedrich von Hayek.</p>
<p>One of Tom&rsquo;s books I&rsquo;ve deeply admired,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Knowledge and Decisions,&rsquo;</p>
<p>is an extension of the Hayekian arguments</p>
<p>about the limits of central planning and whatnot.</p>
<p>So I think Thomas Sowell, African American,</p>
<p>born as I understand it in Louisiana,</p>
<p>raised in New York City, graduate of Harvard College,</p>
<p>a military veteran, a PhD in economics</p>
<p>from the University of Chicago,</p>
<p>a black conservative social scientist</p>
<p>of very high stature, I think he&rsquo;s a great man.</p>
<p>And one of the great intellectuals of the 20th century.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying implicitly deserves a Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>Yeah, I do think so.</p>
<p>I mean, Hayek was awarded by the committee.</p>
<p>Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist</p>
<p>who wrote about economic development,</p>
<p>wrote a famous two volume work,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;An American Dilemma,&rsquo; about the status of blacks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I mean, I think Tom could be put in that company</p>
<p>very easily without any difficulty.</p>
<p>I agree, Daniel Kahneman, them,</p>
<p>so it doesn&rsquo;t have to be an American.</p>
<p>Psychologist, an economist, Eleonora Ostrom,</p>
<p>the political scientist who was honored in a joint prize</p>
<p>given to her and Oliver Williamson 15 years ago or so.</p>
<p>He could be put in that company really quite easily.</p>
<p>Let me ask you, you mentioned Obama</p>
<p>in the very beginning that we were talking about.</p>
<p>How did it feel, that seems like forever ago,</p>
<p>that in 2008, Barack Obama became president?</p>
<p>Now at that time, perhaps you identify</p>
<p>as conservative already.</p>
<p>So politics aside, just in general,</p>
<p>how did it feel that in 150 years</p>
<p>where this country has come along?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I didn&rsquo;t identify in 2008</p>
<p>as a conservative to the same extent that I do today.</p>
<p>I was kind of in transition yet again.</p>
<p>I was excited by the Obama candidacy.</p>
<p>At first I was skeptical because after all, he&rsquo;s not black.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s father is a Kenyan</p>
<p>and the man&rsquo;s mother is a white American</p>
<p>and he identifies as black.</p>
<p>I find it interesting that the first black president</p>
<p>of the United States,</p>
<p>and I could have put inverted commas around black,</p>
<p>and the first black vice president of the United States,</p>
<p>neither of them descend from American slaves.</p>
<p>Kamala Harris&rsquo;s father is of African ancestry in part.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a Jamaican immigrant</p>
<p>and her mother is an Indian immigrant.</p>
<p>She was Kamala Harris,</p>
<p>raised up largely in Canada,</p>
<p>though born in the United States.</p>
<p>Barack Obama is, as I&rsquo;ve said, of mixed ancestry</p>
<p>and neither of his parents are the descendants</p>
<p>of American descendants of African slaves.</p>
<p>But blackness is flexible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that you can put on</p>
<p>or you can take off to a certain degree for some people</p>
<p>and so be it.</p>
<p>I was excited, our time has come, hope and change.</p>
<p>We are the ones we&rsquo;ve been waiting for.</p>
<p>These are slogans from 2008.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe I bought that crap.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>Let me push back here.</p>
<p>You talked about, I mean, to me a Jew is a Jew.</p>
<p>Skin color is skin color.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, Barack Obama is black when it matters,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking to a white supremacist,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking to, if you&rsquo;re a slave owner,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s black.</p>
<p>Just like you said, when Hitler comes around,</p>
<p>a Jew is a Jew.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter how you identify, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what.</p>
<p>So in that sense, don&rsquo;t you think that Barack Obama</p>
<p>is black in the most powerful of ways,</p>
<p>which is designating how far the MLK, the Dr. King vision?</p>
<p>Oh, sure.</p>
<p>And look, I said it a little bit tongue in cheek.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, of course.</p>
<p>But I think Obama has been very careful</p>
<p>about manufacturing a kind of public persona</p>
<p>that is intended to position him in the most effective way.</p>
<p>You mean like every politician?</p>
<p>Yeah, like every politician, sure.</p>
<p>And that the racial identity piece is an aspect of that.</p>
<p>I mean, anything I say here would only be speculation</p>
<p>because I have no facts about the personal history</p>
<p>of Barack Obama.</p>
<p>And I accept Barack Hussein Obama,</p>
<p>as Hillary Clinton once said, I take him at his word</p>
<p>about whatever she was talking about.</p>
<p>Well, was he a Christian?</p>
<p>I think is what the question was.</p>
<p>And there was some right wing attack on Obama</p>
<p>for having been raised for some years in the Philippines</p>
<p>and all of that, or Indonesia, I beg your pardon,</p>
<p>in Indonesia and his stepfather and all of that.</p>
<p>But she took him at his word and I take him at his word</p>
<p>about his racial identity.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>But you were captivated by the power of his words</p>
<p>and you regret to the degree you were captivated.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I think in retrospect,</p>
<p>that whole campaign looks like a pie in the sky</p>
<p>kind of fairy tale.</p>
<p>We are the ones we&rsquo;ve been waiting for.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t quote exactly that speech that he gave</p>
<p>in Grant Park in Chicago when he was announced</p>
<p>as the winner of the election.</p>
<p>But today is the day that the rise of the ocean</p>
<p>stopped words to this effect.</p>
<p>I mean, those who doubted that we could do it,</p>
<p>that tonight is your answer.</p>
<p>This was gonna be a new day, it was gonna be a new regime.</p>
<p>Well, it wasn&rsquo;t a new day and it wasn&rsquo;t a new regime.</p>
<p>It was American politics more or less as usual.</p>
<p>Barack Obama turns out not to be the Messiah.</p>
<p>Maybe there should be no surprise in that.</p>
<p>Race relations got set back during Obama&rsquo;s tenure.</p>
<p>My beef with Obama is that, okay, you&rsquo;re black.</p>
<p>You say you&rsquo;re black, you&rsquo;re black.</p>
<p>You got elected, now we have a black president.</p>
<p>A black president.</p>
<p>You can do stuff that nobody else could do.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a black president.</p>
<p>You could tell the people burning down the city</p>
<p>to get their butts back in their houses and to stop it.</p>
<p>You could tell the race hustlers,</p>
<p>they all shocked into the world.</p>
<p>Not only has our time come</p>
<p>for those who supported my campaign,</p>
<p>your time is over for those who wanna carry on</p>
<p>a advocacy rooted in racial grievance.</p>
<p>The election of myself to this highest office proves</p>
<p>that the institution of this state are legitimate</p>
<p>and open to all comers.</p>
<p>I think Barack Obama, when the SHIT hit the fan,</p>
<p>if I had a son, he&rsquo;d look like Trayvon.</p>
<p>I deeply regret that he said that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s president of the United States.</p>
<p>The color of his skin and the color of Trayvon&rsquo;s skin,</p>
<p>the correlation between those two things.</p>
<p>If I had a son, he&rsquo;d look like Trayvon.</p>
<p>Now he says, when he said it,</p>
<p>he only meant to sympathize with the parents.</p>
<p>But in fact, when he said it from the highest office</p>
<p>in the land and then sent his attorney general,</p>
<p>Eric Holder out to enforce this narrative,</p>
<p>he doubled down on a racial narrative</p>
<p>that I think is actually false.</p>
<p>I think the story that systemic racism in America</p>
<p>as reflected in policing that terrorizes black people</p>
<p>because of the color of their skin is demonstrably false.</p>
<p>I think that the central threat to black lives</p>
<p>is violent crime perpetrated largely by black people</p>
<p>against other black people.</p>
<p>I think there is such a thing as police brutality</p>
<p>and I think there are reasons to have regulations of police</p>
<p>but I think it is a second order issue</p>
<p>in terms of the quality of life of African Americans.</p>
<p>I think Obama could have told the people</p>
<p>who after Freddie Gray died in police custody</p>
<p>in a van in Baltimore and who undertook</p>
<p>to burn that city down to get their asses off the street</p>
<p>and go back to their apartments and stop it.</p>
<p>I think he could have said in the aftermath</p>
<p>of Michael Brown being shot dead by Darren Wilson</p>
<p>in Ferguson, Missouri and there was a grand jury deliberation</p>
<p>that he elected not to indict Officer Wilson</p>
<p>and people took the streets in that city</p>
<p>and stood on top of vehicles and so forth and so on.</p>
<p>He could have told them we don&rsquo;t mob around courthouses</p>
<p>in this country, we respect the rule of law,</p>
<p>get your butts off the streets</p>
<p>and back into your apartments.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>To push back a little bit.</p>
<p>Yeah, good, push back.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re asking Barack Obama,</p>
<p>the first black president of the United States,</p>
<p>to do the thing that I think should be done</p>
<p>by the second black president of the United States.</p>
<p>I think his very example, given the color of his skin,</p>
<p>was the most powerful thing.</p>
<p>And actually doing some of these hard Thomas Sowell type</p>
<p>of Glen Lurie type of strong words about race,</p>
<p>it may be too much to ask given the nature</p>
<p>of modern day politics.</p>
<p>He is a politician.</p>
<p>And he needed to get elected, he needed to get reelected.</p>
<p>It was in his second term</p>
<p>where most of what I&rsquo;m talking about happened,</p>
<p>so he wasn&rsquo;t facing further election.</p>
<p>But Obama was what, 46 or 47 when he was inaugurated?</p>
<p>He served for eight years, so he&rsquo;s in his mid 50s.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got another half century or 40 years of life,</p>
<p>God willing.</p>
<p>His post presidency, I think,</p>
<p>was what was primarily on his mind.</p>
<p>Not getting elected to anything,</p>
<p>but being enshrined in a certain way.</p>
<p>And the persona that he is now embodying,</p>
<p>which depends upon a racial narrative</p>
<p>that I and Thomas Sowell and others object to,</p>
<p>I think was very much in the forefront of his mind</p>
<p>when he made decisions as the chief executive officer</p>
<p>of the country that we&rsquo;ve all now have to live with.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the fact is, he opened the door</p>
<p>in a way that hasn&rsquo;t been done</p>
<p>in the history of the United States,</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t see there being even a significant discussion</p>
<p>when an African American, a black man or a black woman</p>
<p>runs for president, maybe a black man, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>because there still hasn&rsquo;t been a woman president.</p>
<p>I just see that that broke open the possibility of that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not even a discussion.</p>
<p>And that example by itself, I mean, to me,</p>
<p>the role of the president isn&rsquo;t just policy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to inspire.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to do the Dr. King thing, which is, I have a dream.</p>
<p>And Barack Obama is an example of somebody</p>
<p>that could give one hell of a speech.</p>
<p>It got you to believe.</p>
<p>Obama is a smooth operator without any question.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a master of his craft.</p>
<p>He did the impossible.</p>
<p>I mean, he beat Hillary Clinton in that primary fight,</p>
<p>and he beat John McCain in that general election,</p>
<p>and hats off to him.</p>
<p>And moreover, he remains a iconic figure in American culture.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any doubt about that.</p>
<p>Let me just mention, Clarence Thomas is also black.</p>
<p>Clarence Thomas has a story that is vivid and inspiring,</p>
<p>just like Obama&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>He overcome obstacles just like Obama did.</p>
<p>I mean, extreme poverty and so forth and so on.</p>
<p>Clarence Thomas has served longer than any other member</p>
<p>of the United States Supreme Court.</p>
<p>He is one of nine justices,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s three equal branches of government.</p>
<p>So Clarence Thomas, by my arithmetic,</p>
<p>personifies 1 27th of the American state.</p>
<p>He is an iconic figure.</p>
<p>His example should be an inspiration to Americans</p>
<p>of all races, but especially a black American youngsters.</p>
<p>He happens to be conservative.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very conservative.</p>
<p>So fucking what?</p>
<p>He too deserves to be in that pantheon.</p>
<p>He is not. By the custodians of American education,</p>
<p>Clarence Thomas&rsquo;s name is not on that many schools.</p>
<p>Barack Obama&rsquo;s name will be on many of them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not equating them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re different people.</p>
<p>The offices are very different.</p>
<p>But the same logic that you just used</p>
<p>to extol the significance of Barack Obama&rsquo;s ascendancy</p>
<p>could and should be applied to Clarence Thomas,</p>
<p>in my opinion.</p>
<p>Yes, but it&rsquo;s the office, but also there is a resume</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s accomplishments,</p>
<p>but then there is oratory and charisma</p>
<p>and a number of Twitter followers.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s ability to captivate a large number of people.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a skill.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a skill that correlates,</p>
<p>but is not directly connected to</p>
<p>with how impressive your resume is.</p>
<p>I agree, and moreover, the judicial function,</p>
<p>the judge doesn&rsquo;t go out and give speeches of that sort</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s exactly antithetical to what he&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a custodian of the law,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not a popular feature,</p>
<p>figure in American policy.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t stand for election, and it&rsquo;s a good thing too.</p>
<p>So I take that point.</p>
<p>Here, I want to say something else, though,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s provocative.</p>
<p>The next black president,</p>
<p>you say the first black president</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t have been the one to do that.</p>
<p>The second one should,</p>
<p>is more likely than not gonna be a Republican.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, I don&rsquo;t have a particular person in mind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying.</p>
<p>I agree, I agree, I agree.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s gonna be super fun.</p>
<p>Let me ask you to put on your wise sage hat</p>
<p>and give advice to young people.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re talking to somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s in high school, in college,</p>
<p>what advice would you give them about their career,</p>
<p>about life in general,</p>
<p>how to live a life they can be proud of?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;d say the world is your oyster.</p>
<p>I mean, first order of business, you&rsquo;re not a victim.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what color you are.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care, you&rsquo;re male, female,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gay, straight, whatever.</p>
<p>The world is your oyster.</p>
<p>You are so privileged.</p>
<p>You sit here in the United States of America,</p>
<p>a free country, a rich country,</p>
<p>everything is possible for you.</p>
<p>Believe me, you can do anything, okay?</p>
<p>Secondly, I would say mastery over the medium</p>
<p>in which we&rsquo;re embedded is the key to the future.</p>
<p>So get educated, focus, work hard,</p>
<p>invest in your future by acquiring the skills that you need</p>
<p>to be able to navigate the 21st century.</p>
<p>I would say the Chinese are coming</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t mean anything against China.</p>
<p>I just mean to say the world&rsquo;s a small place</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s getting smaller.</p>
<p>And you better get moving and you better get moving quickly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say your identity, your coloration, your orientation,</p>
<p>your category is not the most important thing about you.</p>
<p>So the temptation to limit yourself,</p>
<p>I give this speech to my kids.</p>
<p>I would say, I quote James Joyce.</p>
<p>He has a passage in Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man</p>
<p>in which he says, do you know what Ireland is?</p>
<p>Ireland is an old sow that eats her pharaoh.</p>
<p>This is Joyce.</p>
<p>He says, Stephan Daedalus is the character</p>
<p>that he has in mind in this Chronicle.</p>
<p>He says, your ethnic inheritance,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s talking about Irish nationalism,</p>
<p>are like nets holding you back.</p>
<p>That your challenge is to learn how to turn those nets</p>
<p>into wings and thereby to fly, okay?</p>
<p>Flying into the open skies of modern society.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be your grandfather, don&rsquo;t be your father.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t wear your things so heavily</p>
<p>that it keeps you from being open</p>
<p>to everything that&rsquo;s new in the world.</p>
<p>Wear it lightly.</p>
<p>Yes, everybody comes from somewhere,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be where you end up.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not your father, you&rsquo;re not your grandfather.</p>
<p>You are this wonderfully blessed human being</p>
<p>in the middle of, going into the middle of the 21st century</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t miss it, don&rsquo;t live blinkeredly,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t live small, live big.</p>
<p>Live big and wear your history lightly.</p>
<p>Yeah, everybody&rsquo;s got a mother tongue,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s got a story, everybody has a people,</p>
<p>but the world is a small place.</p>
<p>I love that you&rsquo;re quoting an Irishman.</p>
<p>One of the greatest writers of the 20th century,</p>
<p>a profound one, but an Irishman nevertheless.</p>
<p>The levels of humor within that is not lost on me.</p>
<p>Let me just mention the great Ralph Ellison,</p>
<p>the African American writer, Invisible Man</p>
<p>is his masterpiece, embodied this spirit.</p>
<p>Okay, we black Americans, we do come from somewhere,</p>
<p>that come in from somewhere is from slavery in America,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s our ancestral heritage.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not what we are, skin and bone,</p>
<p>these are superficial things, the spirit.</p>
<p>And if I were a more religious person,</p>
<p>I could give a whole disposition about that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the spirit, it&rsquo;s that light that&rsquo;s inside,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s who we are and our challenge</p>
<p>is to live in the fullness of it,</p>
<p>as opposed to this blinkered thing</p>
<p>where we don&rsquo;t look left, we don&rsquo;t look right,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just fitting within this template that we inherit.</p>
<p>That is a travesty, really.</p>
<p>Glenn, you&rsquo;ve lived an incredible life, a productive one,</p>
<p>but just representing some powerful ideas,</p>
<p>some powerful ideals, but life comes to an end.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you think about your death?</p>
<p>Are you afraid of it?</p>
<p>Well, it is a really interesting coincidence</p>
<p>that you posed me that question,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m coming from a funeral.</p>
<p>Today is Sunday, on the preceding Tuesday, five days ago,</p>
<p>I was at the funeral of Eugene Wesley Smith,</p>
<p>who was my brother in law, he was my sister&rsquo;s husband.</p>
<p>My sister, Leonette, passed away in August of 2021.</p>
<p>Her husband has died at the age of 68 in April of 2022,</p>
<p>and I was at his funeral.</p>
<p>He died suddenly of a heart attack</p>
<p>that came completely out of the blue.</p>
<p>He seemed to be in perfect health.</p>
<p>He was a magnificent human being.</p>
<p>I could go into the details, but take my word for it.</p>
<p>He was a businessman, a steel trader, metals trader.</p>
<p>He would buy and sell.</p>
<p>He worked mostly from his home office.</p>
<p>He had clients, counterparties,</p>
<p>people he did business with all over the world.</p>
<p>He had three sons, one of whom is in his early 30s,</p>
<p>two of whom are in their late 30s.</p>
<p>These are my sister&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s deceased, now he&rsquo;s deceased.</p>
<p>The older two sons are severely developmentally disabled,</p>
<p>and although they&rsquo;re in their late 30s,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not independently viable.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t function effectively.</p>
<p>They have to be cared for.</p>
<p>That responsibility has now fallen to the family,</p>
<p>but mainly to the surviving son who lives with his wife</p>
<p>and his two young children,</p>
<p>and has assumed the responsibility.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve cared at home, my sister and her husband, Wesley,</p>
<p>Eugene Wesley Smith, cared for their disabled sons at home.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t want to see them institutionalized.</p>
<p>They had some help from programs at the state</p>
<p>and social worker and so on,</p>
<p>but they mainly took on the burden</p>
<p>of caring for them at home.</p>
<p>Anyway, I go on at length here,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know how much of this you will choose</p>
<p>to make use of, and it doesn&rsquo;t matter, really.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to respond to your question.</p>
<p>I was asked to offer some remarks at the funeral,</p>
<p>and I offered them.</p>
<p>And I spoke well of this great man.</p>
<p>He was a great man.</p>
<p>He had a straight back.</p>
<p>He was a standup guy.</p>
<p>He could be counted on.</p>
<p>His word was his bond.</p>
<p>He had broad shoulders.</p>
<p>He carried a lot of people with him,</p>
<p>business associates, family members,</p>
<p>and so forth and so on.</p>
<p>He had a huge heart.</p>
<p>He was a giving and kind person.</p>
<p>He had a great mind.</p>
<p>He was an intellectual, even though as a businessman,</p>
<p>much of his day was taken up with the minutia of contracts</p>
<p>and the details of the order being delivered</p>
<p>and not being delivered,</p>
<p>of the quality of the product,</p>
<p>of the financing, and so forth and so on.</p>
<p>There was still a powerful mind there.</p>
<p>Yeah, he was a powerful mind, and he studied.</p>
<p>He read books.</p>
<p>He was interested in music and art.</p>
<p>He was a spiritual seeker,</p>
<p>had been ordained as a child minister in his youth,</p>
<p>and while he remained a master of the Christian canon,</p>
<p>he also explored Eastern religion and other spiritual paths</p>
<p>and kind of stood above any particular tradition</p>
<p>as a man who believed in God</p>
<p>but thought that God manifests himself in many ways</p>
<p>to human beings and that there was much to learn</p>
<p>from other religious traditions as well.</p>
<p>This is Wesley.</p>
<p>We called him Wesley by his middle name,</p>
<p>Eugene Wesley Smith.</p>
<p>May he rest in peace.</p>
<p>68.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s five years younger than I am right now.</p>
<p>He dropped dead without any warning.</p>
<p>I could, too.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>How did that make you feel?</p>
<p>What were the thoughts in your mind leading up to it,</p>
<p>having to give that speech in the days that followed?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, I wondered,</p>
<p>what would I say, what would I say?</p>
<p>And, you know, there was no way to prepare,</p>
<p>and I decided, you know, I rehearsed in my mind this,</p>
<p>you know, he had straight back, he had broad shoulders,</p>
<p>he had a big heart, he had a great mind,</p>
<p>you know, he had a capacious spirit and whatnot,</p>
<p>and I used that as a template for making my remarks.</p>
<p>But my main thought was, my God,</p>
<p>life is precious and life is fleeting,</p>
<p>and death is a part of life.</p>
<p>My death is a part of my life.</p>
<p>And I thought, you know, well,</p>
<p>I want to take better care of myself than I do,</p>
<p>you know, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>But I also thought, a lot of this is not in my hands at all.</p>
<p>I thought, one should have his affairs in order.</p>
<p>My brother did not have all of his affairs in order,</p>
<p>in the sense that there is a lot of,</p>
<p>you know, things are going to probate,</p>
<p>there was no will, there&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of unsettled.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want that to happen to my surviving family members.</p>
<p>I want to have my affairs such that, should heaven forbid,</p>
<p>I fall over one day and don&rsquo;t get up again.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t have to scramble about</p>
<p>how to take care of things from that point forward.</p>
<p>But as a human, are you afraid?</p>
<p>In your own heart.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid.</p>
<p>Now, I read this wonderful book called The Swerve.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about Lucretius.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the nature of things,</p>
<p>which is this great classical work from the Roman period</p>
<p>by this guy, Lucretius.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m trying to think of the name of the author,</p>
<p>but you could look it up.</p>
<p>The Swerve is the book.</p>
<p>It won like a National Book Award or a Pulitzer Prize.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the history of the recovery of this book</p>
<p>by one of these Italian, Renaissance Italian people</p>
<p>who would go into the monasteries in Central Europe</p>
<p>and look through the scrolls and they discover</p>
<p>these classical works from antiquity,</p>
<p>which had been lost through the dark ages</p>
<p>and they republish and read these works.</p>
<p>And Lucretius&rsquo;s great work on the nature of things</p>
<p>was one of these books, Poggio Broccolini.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember the Italian guy&rsquo;s name,</p>
<p>but this all could be looked up.</p>
<p>Yeah, Poggio Broccolini.</p>
<p>15th century and the name of the author</p>
<p>is Stephen Greenblatt.</p>
<p>Yeah, Stephen Greenblatt, a magnificent book</p>
<p>and a terrific story.</p>
<p>Anyway, one of Lucretius&rsquo;s points, he was an atheist.</p>
<p>I mean, he was a Roman.</p>
<p>I mean, he didn&rsquo;t believe in mysticism.</p>
<p>And he argued it&rsquo;s irrational to be afraid of death.</p>
<p>Why should I fear death?</p>
<p>Death is coming to all of us.</p>
<p>The point of being afraid, I mean, I&rsquo;m wasting my time</p>
<p>fearing something that I have no ultimate control over.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s irrational to be afraid of death.</p>
<p>Yeah, because you can&rsquo;t predict when it happens.</p>
<p>You only know that it happens.</p>
<p>So why be afraid?</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>And therefore live every day fully,</p>
<p>live every day purposefully, you know,</p>
<p>and so on, but these are all just words.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t wanna die.</p>
<p>I wanna live forever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna live forever.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna suffer.</p>
<p>I see people suffering.</p>
<p>I saw my late wife, Linda Datcher Lowry,</p>
<p>Dr. Linda Datcher Lowry, professor of economics</p>
<p>at Tufts University, whom I met in graduate school at MIT,</p>
<p>black woman from Baltimore.</p>
<p>We married, we raised two sons together.</p>
<p>She died at the age of 59 from metastatic breast cancer.</p>
<p>And I watched her suffer and I watched her die.</p>
<p>And it took a while.</p>
<p>And we cared for her at home right up until the very end.</p>
<p>She died in our bed with our sons on either side of her.</p>
<p>And the dog curled up by the door,</p>
<p>the porch door in the bedroom, and she expired.</p>
<p>And I watched her suffer and I watched her die.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t wanna suffer.</p>
<p>Who does?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna die.</p>
<p>I am likely to suffer before I die.</p>
<p>I am likely to see my death coming and to lament it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a book by Richard John Newhouse, the theologian,</p>
<p>called As I Lay Dying,</p>
<p>As I Lay Dying, Richard John Newhouse.</p>
<p>He had stomach cancer and he thought he was dying.</p>
<p>And he wrote this book As I Lay Dying.</p>
<p>And then he recovered, he went into remission</p>
<p>and he had another couple of years.</p>
<p>He thought he was dying and he had another couple of years.</p>
<p>And I can remember meeting him at a bookstore</p>
<p>in suburban Boston when he was on a tour.</p>
<p>He was just a friend of mine,</p>
<p>a theologian and a public intellectual.</p>
<p>He founded the Institute on Religion and Public Life</p>
<p>in New York City, which still exists,</p>
<p>Richard John Newhouse.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s contemplating his own death</p>
<p>from the point of view of a Christian minister.</p>
<p>He was first a Lutheran pastor</p>
<p>and then he converted to Catholicism</p>
<p>or as he would have put it, I returned to the church</p>
<p>because he thought the Renaissance was over.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sorry, the Reformation,</p>
<p>Richard thought was over.</p>
<p>He says there&rsquo;s only one church, et cetera.</p>
<p>Get into theology stuff here.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m saying all that to say,</p>
<p>I read that book aloud to my wife, Linda,</p>
<p>as she lay dying in that bed.</p>
<p>I read that book and it was filled with hope.</p>
<p>I mean, it first acknowledged the dread.</p>
<p>Yes, I lie dying.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna die.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Christian minister.</p>
<p>Christ was raised from the dead.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m supposed to believe in everlasting life</p>
<p>but the fact of the matter is this is me</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m lying here and I&rsquo;m dying.</p>
<p>This is the end of me.</p>
<p>How are you gonna do anything other than dread</p>
<p>the end of me?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s acknowledge that I don&rsquo;t wanna die, okay?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna tell you that upfront.</p>
<p>But that is not the end of,</p>
<p>my death is not the end of life.</p>
<p>I have lived well and fully.</p>
<p>I will go and do my best right up until the end.</p>
<p>I will accept what is inevitable</p>
<p>and I will hold out this belief.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a Christian minister so he holds out this belief.</p>
<p>And he knows that the belief is not rational.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a reasoned deductive scientific conclusion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s spiritual in the most fundamental way.</p>
<p>It is something that people hold on to and they have hope</p>
<p>and he had hope.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I have that hope.</p>
<p>I used to be, but I&rsquo;m no longer a Christian</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m no longer a theist really.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with Lucretius there.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no magic that&rsquo;s going on here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no unseen hand behind the scene</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s arranging things.</p>
<p>What I believe is that when I look at the natural world,</p>
<p>I see the evolution of the species</p>
<p>and I see the organic development of the planets.</p>
<p>I mean, the earth is going to not exist</p>
<p>in a finite number of years.</p>
<p>I think with a very high probability,</p>
<p>the sun is gonna die.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna implode.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna go supernova, whatever is gonna happen.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s not gonna be any there, there.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life, Glen Lowry?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the meaning of life.</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s go, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the why?</p>
<p>Or is that something economists and social scientists</p>
<p>and mathematicians are not equipped to answer?</p>
<p>Surely.</p>
<p>You know, I think we try to live well and meaningfully</p>
<p>within our time.</p>
<p>We bond, we reproduce, we try to pass on</p>
<p>and we accept our limitations and our mortality.</p>
<p>We try to contribute</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s through our children and through our work.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re in this together, we&rsquo;re not in this alone.</p>
<p>We are connected to other people.</p>
<p>I get a lot of gratitude out of teaching.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a teacher.</p>
<p>My students are gonna outlive me.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna have students.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a writer.</p>
<p>My writing is gonna outlive me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna be self important or pretentious here.</p>
<p>I doubt that I&rsquo;m gonna be the James Joyce</p>
<p>of the 21st century.</p>
<p>They may not be reading my stuff in a hundred years</p>
<p>because people will certainly be reading Ulysses</p>
<p>in a hundred years.</p>
<p>But I try to have an impact on the world that I&rsquo;m a part of</p>
<p>and try to leave a legacy that&rsquo;s dignified.</p>
<p>I mean, I could give some flowery words</p>
<p>here, truth seeking and whatnot.</p>
<p>What about love?</p>
<p>Love.</p>
<p>What role does love play in this life thing?</p>
<p>Love makes the world go round.</p>
<p>I mean, without love, I mean, what have we got?</p>
<p>I mean, we don&rsquo;t have family and, you know,</p>
<p>we certainly have missed out if love is not a central part</p>
<p>of our existence.</p>
<p>But stop asking me questions like that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Glenn, thank you for doing everything you do,</p>
<p>for thinking the way you do, for being fearless and bold.</p>
<p>And the Glenn show and your writing and your work</p>
<p>and just being who you are.</p>
<p>Thank you for being you.</p>
<p>And thank you for giving me the huge honor</p>
<p>of spending your extremely valuable time with me today.</p>
<p>This was awesome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been my pleasure, Lex.</p>
<p>I mean, really, and it has been like four hours, man.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re wearing me out for me.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Glenn Lowry.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t fly, then run.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t run, then walk.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t walk, then crawl.</p>
<p>But whatever you do, you have to keep moving forward.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
