    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>The following is a conversation with Whitney Cummings.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a standup comedian, actor, producer, writer, director,</p>
<p>and recently, finally, the host of her very own podcast</p>
<p>called Good For You.</p>
<p>Her most recent Netflix special called Can I Touch It?</p>
<p>features in part a robot she affectionately named</p>
<p>Bearclaw that is designed to be visually a replica of Whitney.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exciting for me to see one of my favorite comedians</p>
<p>explore the social aspects of robotics and AI in our society.</p>
<p>She also has some fascinating ideas</p>
<p>about human behavior, psychology, and neurology,</p>
<p>some of which she explores in her book</p>
<p>called I&rsquo;m Fine and Other Lies.</p>
<p>It was truly a pleasure to meet Whitney</p>
<p>and have this conversation with her</p>
<p>and even to continue it through text afterwards.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, late at night,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be programming over a cup of coffee</p>
<p>and will get a text from Whitney saying something hilarious</p>
<p>or weirder yet, sending a video of Brian Callan</p>
<p>saying something hilarious.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I know the universe has a sense of humor</p>
<p>and it gifted me with one hell of an amazing journey.</p>
<p>Then I put the phone down and go back to programming</p>
<p>with a stupid, joyful smile on my face.</p>
<p>If you enjoy this conversation,</p>
<p>listen to Whitney&rsquo;s podcast, Good For You,</p>
<p>and follow her on Twitter and Instagram.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,</p>
<p>give it five stars on Apple Podcasts,</p>
<p>support on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter</p>
<p>at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.</p>
<p>This show is presented by Cash App,</p>
<p>the number one finance app in the App Store.</p>
<p>They regularly support Whitney&rsquo;s Good For You podcast</p>
<p>as well.</p>
<p>I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,</p>
<p>but you can also use it to buy, sell,</p>
<p>and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds.</p>
<p>Cash App also has a new investing feature.</p>
<p>You can buy fractions of a stock, say $1 worth,</p>
<p>no matter what the stock price is.</p>
<p>Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing,</p>
<p>subsidiary of Square, and member SIPC.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to be working with Cash App</p>
<p>to support one of my favorite organizations called First,</p>
<p>best known for their FIRST Robotics and Lego competitions.</p>
<p>They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students</p>
<p>in over 110 countries,</p>
<p>and have a perfect rating on Charity Navigator,</p>
<p>which means the donated money</p>
<p>is used to maximum effectiveness.</p>
<p>When you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play,</p>
<p>and use code LEXPODCAST, you&rsquo;ll get $10,</p>
<p>and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,</p>
<p>which again, is an organization that I&rsquo;ve personally seen</p>
<p>inspire girls and boys to dream</p>
<p>of engineering a better world.</p>
<p>This podcast is supported by ZipRecruiter.</p>
<p>Hiring great people is hard,</p>
<p>and to me is the most important element</p>
<p>of a successful mission driven team.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been fortunate to be a part of,</p>
<p>and to lead several great engineering teams.</p>
<p>The hiring I&rsquo;ve done in the past</p>
<p>was mostly through tools that we built ourselves,</p>
<p>but reinventing the wheel was painful.</p>
<p>ZipRecruiter is a tool that&rsquo;s already available for you.</p>
<p>It seeks to make hiring simple, fast, and smart.</p>
<p>For example, Codable cofounder Gretchen Huebner</p>
<p>used ZipRecruiter to find a new game artist</p>
<p>to join her education tech company.</p>
<p>By using ZipRecruiter screening questions</p>
<p>to filter candidates, Gretchen found it easier</p>
<p>to focus on the best candidates,</p>
<p>and finally hiring the perfect person for the role</p>
<p>in less than two weeks from start to finish.</p>
<p>ZipRecruiter, the smartest way to hire.</p>
<p>See why ZipRecruiter is effective</p>
<p>for businesses of all sizes by signing up as I did</p>
<p>for free at ziprecruiter.com slash lexpod.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s ziprecruiter.com slash lexpod.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Whitney Cummings.</p>
<p>I have trouble making eye contact, as you can tell.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>Did you know that I had to work on making eye contact</p>
<p>because I used to look here?</p>
<p>Do you see what I&rsquo;m doing?</p>
<p>That helps, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Do you want me to do that?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll do this way, I&rsquo;ll cheat the camera.</p>
<p>But I used to do this, and finally people,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;d be on dates and guys would be like,</p>
<p>are you looking at my hair?</p>
<p>Like they get, it would make people really insecure</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t really get a lot of eye contact as a kid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one to three years.</p>
<p>Did you not get a lot of eye contact as a kid?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t done the soul searching.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So, but there&rsquo;s definitely some psychological issues.</p>
<p>Makes you uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Yeah, for some reason when I connect eyes,</p>
<p>I start to think, I assume that you&rsquo;re judging me.</p>
<p>Oh, well, I am.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you assume that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We all are.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>This is perfect.</p>
<p>The podcast would be me and you both</p>
<p>staring at the table on the whole time.</p>
<p>Do you think robots are the future?</p>
<p>Ones with human level intelligence</p>
<p>will be female, male, genderless,</p>
<p>or another gender we have not yet created as a society?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the expert at this.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m gonna ask you.</p>
<p>You know the answer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna ask you questions</p>
<p>that maybe nobody knows the answer to.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And then I just want you to hypothesize</p>
<p>as a imaginative author, director, comedian.</p>
<p>Can we just be very clear</p>
<p>that you know a ton about this</p>
<p>and I know nothing about this,</p>
<p>but I have thought a lot about</p>
<p>what I think robots can fix in our society.</p>
<p>And I mean, I&rsquo;m a comedian.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my job to study human nature,</p>
<p>to make jokes about human nature</p>
<p>and to sometimes play devil&rsquo;s advocate.</p>
<p>And I just see such a tremendous negativity around robots</p>
<p>or at least the idea of robots that it was like,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m just gonna take the opposite side for fun,</p>
<p>for jokes and then I was like,</p>
<p>oh no, I really agree in this devil&rsquo;s advocate argument.</p>
<p>So please correct me when I&rsquo;m wrong about this stuff.</p>
<p>So first of all, there&rsquo;s no right and wrong</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re all,</p>
<p>I think most of the people working on robotics</p>
<p>are really not actually even thinking</p>
<p>about some of the big picture things</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve been exploring.</p>
<p>In fact, your robot, what&rsquo;s her name by the way?</p>
<p>Bearclaw.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll go with Bearclaw.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the genesis of that name by the way?</p>
<p>Bearclaw was, I got, I don&rsquo;t even remember the joke</p>
<p>cause I black out after I shoot specials,</p>
<p>but I was writing something about like the pet names</p>
<p>that men call women, like cupcake, sweetie, honey,</p>
<p>you know, like we&rsquo;re always named after desserts</p>
<p>or something and I was just writing a joke about,</p>
<p>if you wanna call us a dessert,</p>
<p>at least pick like a cool dessert, you know,</p>
<p>like Bearclaw, like something cool.</p>
<p>So I ended up calling her Bearclaw.</p>
<p>So do you think the future robots</p>
<p>of greater and greater intelligence</p>
<p>would like to make them female, male?</p>
<p>Would we like to assign them gender</p>
<p>or would we like to move away from gender</p>
<p>and say something more ambiguous?</p>
<p>I think it depends on their purpose, you know?</p>
<p>I feel like if it&rsquo;s a sex robot,</p>
<p>people prefer certain genders, you know?</p>
<p>And I also, you know, when I went down and explored the robot</p>
<p>factory, I was asking about the type of people</p>
<p>that bought sex robots.</p>
<p>And I was very surprised at the answer</p>
<p>because of course the stereotype</p>
<p>was it&rsquo;s gonna be a bunch of perverts.</p>
<p>It ended up being a lot of people that were handicapped,</p>
<p>a lot of people with erectile dysfunction</p>
<p>and a lot of people that were exploring their sexuality.</p>
<p>A lot of people that thought they were gay,</p>
<p>but weren&rsquo;t sure, but didn&rsquo;t wanna take the risk</p>
<p>of trying on someone that could reject them</p>
<p>and being embarrassed or they were closeted</p>
<p>or in a city where maybe that&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>taboo and stigmatized, you know?</p>
<p>So I think that a gendered sex robot</p>
<p>that would serve an important purpose</p>
<p>for someone trying to explore their sexuality.</p>
<p>Am I into men?</p>
<p>Let me try on this thing first.</p>
<p>Am I into women?</p>
<p>Let me try on this thing first.</p>
<p>So I think gendered robots would be important for that.</p>
<p>But I think genderless robots in terms of</p>
<p>emotional support robots, babysitters,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fine for a genderless babysitter</p>
<p>with my husband in the house.</p>
<p>You know, there are places that I think</p>
<p>that genderless makes a lot of sense,</p>
<p>but obviously not in the sex area.</p>
<p>What do you mean with your husband in the house?</p>
<p>What does that have to do with the gender of the robot?</p>
<p>Right, I mean, I don&rsquo;t have a husband,</p>
<p>but hypothetically speaking,</p>
<p>I think every woman&rsquo;s worst nightmare</p>
<p>is like the hot babysitter.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>So I think that there is a time and place,</p>
<p>I think, for genderless, you know, teachers, doctors,</p>
<p>all that kind of, it would be very awkward</p>
<p>if the first robotic doctor was a guy</p>
<p>or the first robotic nurse was a woman.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s sort of, that stuff is still loaded.</p>
<p>I think that genderless could just take</p>
<p>the unnecessary drama out of it</p>
<p>and possibility to sexualize them</p>
<p>or be triggered by any of that stuff.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s two components to this, to Bearclaw.</p>
<p>So one is the voice and the talking and so on,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the visual appearance.</p>
<p>So on the topic of gender and genderless,</p>
<p>in your experience, what has been the value</p>
<p>of the physical appearance?</p>
<p>So has it added much to the depth of the interaction?</p>
<p>I mean, mine&rsquo;s kind of an extenuating circumstance</p>
<p>because she is supposed to look exactly like me.</p>
<p>I mean, I spent six months getting my face molded</p>
<p>and having, you know, the idea was I was exploring</p>
<p>the concept of can robots replace us?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s the big fear,</p>
<p>but also the big dream in a lot of ways.</p>
<p>And I wanted to dig into that area because, you know,</p>
<p>for a lot of people, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna take our jobs and they&rsquo;re gonna replace us.</p>
<p>Legitimate fear, but then a lot of women I know are like,</p>
<p>I would love for a robot to replace me every now and then</p>
<p>so it can go to baby showers for me</p>
<p>and it can pick up my kids at school</p>
<p>and it can cook dinner and whatever.</p>
<p>So I just think that was an interesting place to explore.</p>
<p>So her looking like me was a big part of it.</p>
<p>Now her looking like me just adds</p>
<p>an unnecessary level of insecurity</p>
<p>because I got her a year ago</p>
<p>and she already looks younger than me.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a weird problem.</p>
<p>But I think that her looking human was the idea.</p>
<p>And I think that where we are now,</p>
<p>please correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>a human robot resembling an actual human you know</p>
<p>is going to feel more realistic than some generic face.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re saying that robots that have some familiarity</p>
<p>like look similar to somebody that you actually know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to form a deeper connection with?</p>
<p>That was the question. I think so on some level, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an open question.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, you know, it&rsquo;s an interesting.</p>
<p>Or the opposite, because then you know me</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, well, I know this isn&rsquo;t real</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re right here.</p>
<p>So maybe it does the opposite.</p>
<p>We have a very keen eye for human faces</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re able to detect strangeness</p>
<p>especially that one has to do with people</p>
<p>whose faces we&rsquo;ve seen a lot of.</p>
<p>So I tend to be a bigger fan</p>
<p>of moving away completely from faces.</p>
<p>Of recognizable faces?</p>
<p>No, just human faces at all.</p>
<p>In general, because I think that&rsquo;s where things get dicey.</p>
<p>And one thing I will say is</p>
<p>I think my robot is more realistic than other robots</p>
<p>not necessarily because you have seen me</p>
<p>and then you see her and you go, oh, they&rsquo;re so similar</p>
<p>but also because human faces are flawed and asymmetrical.</p>
<p>And sometimes we forget when we&rsquo;re making things</p>
<p>that are supposed to look human,</p>
<p>we make them too symmetrical</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what makes them stop looking human.</p>
<p>So because they mold in my asymmetrical face,</p>
<p>she just, even if someone didn&rsquo;t know who I was</p>
<p>I think she&rsquo;d look more realistic than most generic ones</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t have some kind of flaws.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Because they start looking creepy</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re too symmetrical because human beings aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah, the flaws is what it means to be human.</p>
<p>So visually as well.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just a fan of the idea</p>
<p>of letting humans use a little bit more imagination.</p>
<p>So just hearing the voice is enough for us humans</p>
<p>to then start imagining the visual appearance</p>
<p>that goes along with that voice.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t necessarily need to work too hard</p>
<p>on creating the actual visual appearance.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some value to that.</p>
<p>When you step into the stare of actually building a robot</p>
<p>that looks like Bear Claws,</p>
<p>such a long road of facial expressions</p>
<p>of sort of making everything smiling, winking,</p>
<p>rolling in the eyes, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>It gets really, really tricky.</p>
<p>It gets tricky and I think I&rsquo;m, again, I&rsquo;m a comedian.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m obsessed with what makes us human</p>
<p>and our human nature and the nasty side of human nature</p>
<p>tends to be where I&rsquo;ve ended up</p>
<p>exploring over and over again.</p>
<p>And I was just mostly fascinated by people&rsquo;s reaction.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s my job to get the biggest reaction</p>
<p>from a group of strangers, the loudest possible reaction.</p>
<p>And I just had this instinct</p>
<p>just when I started building her</p>
<p>and people going, ah, ah, and people scream.</p>
<p>And I mean, I would bring her out on stage</p>
<p>and people would scream.</p>
<p>And I just, to me, that was the next level of entertainment.</p>
<p>Getting a laugh, I&rsquo;ve done that, I know how to do that.</p>
<p>I think comedians were always trying to figure out</p>
<p>what the next level is and comedy&rsquo;s evolving so much.</p>
<p>And Jordan Peele had just done</p>
<p>these genius comedy horror movies,</p>
<p>which feel like the next level of comedy to me.</p>
<p>And this sort of funny horror of a robot</p>
<p>was fascinating to me.</p>
<p>But I think the thing that I got the most obsessed with</p>
<p>was people being freaked out and scared of her.</p>
<p>And I started digging around with pathogen avoidance</p>
<p>and the idea that we&rsquo;ve essentially evolved</p>
<p>to be repelled by anything that looks human,</p>
<p>but is off a little bit.</p>
<p>Anything that could be sick or diseased or dead,</p>
<p>essentially, is our reptilian brain&rsquo;s way</p>
<p>to get us to not try to have sex with it, basically.</p>
<p>So I got really fascinated by how freaked out and scared.</p>
<p>I mean, I would see grown men get upset.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d get that thing away from me,</p>
<p>look, I don&rsquo;t like that, like people would get angry.</p>
<p>And it was like, you know what this is, you know?</p>
<p>But the sort of like, you know, amygdala getting activated</p>
<p>by something that to me is just a fun toy</p>
<p>said a lot about our history as a species</p>
<p>and what got us into trouble thousands of years ago.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s that, it&rsquo;s the deep down stuff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in our genetics, but also is it just,</p>
<p>are people freaked out by the fact that there&rsquo;s a robot?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just the appearance,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s an artificial human.</p>
<p>Anything people, I think, and I&rsquo;m just also fascinated</p>
<p>by the blind spots humans have.</p>
<p>So the idea that you&rsquo;re afraid of that,</p>
<p>I mean, how many robots have killed people?</p>
<p>How many humans have died at the hands of other humans?</p>
<p>Yeah, a few more. Millions?</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions?</p>
<p>Yet we&rsquo;re scared of that?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll go to the grocery store</p>
<p>and be around a bunch of humans</p>
<p>who statistically the chances are much higher</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna get killed by humans.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just fascinated by without judgment</p>
<p>how irrational we are as a species.</p>
<p>The word is the exponential.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, you know, you can say the same thing</p>
<p>about nuclear weapons before we dropped</p>
<p>on the Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p>
<p>So the worry that people have is the exponential growth.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, oh, it&rsquo;s fun and games right now,</p>
<p>but you know, overnight,</p>
<p>especially if a robot provides value to society,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll put one in every home</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden lose track</p>
<p>of the actual large scale impact it has on society.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden gain greater and greater control</p>
<p>to where we&rsquo;ll all be, you know,</p>
<p>affect our political system</p>
<p>and then affect our decision.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t robots already ruin our political system?</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t that just already happen?</p>
<p>Which ones? Oh, Russia hacking.</p>
<p>No offense, but hasn&rsquo;t that already happened?</p>
<p>I mean, that was like an algorithm</p>
<p>of negative things being clicked on more.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d like to tell stories</p>
<p>and like to demonize certain people.</p>
<p>I think nobody understands our current political system</p>
<p>or discourse on Twitter, the Twitter mobs.</p>
<p>Nobody has a sense, not Twitter, not Facebook,</p>
<p>the people running it.</p>
<p>Nobody understands the impact of these algorithms.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying their best.</p>
<p>Despite what people think,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not like a bunch of lefties</p>
<p>trying to make sure that Hillary Clinton gets elected.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more that it&rsquo;s an incredibly complex system</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t, and that&rsquo;s the worry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so complex and moves so fast</p>
<p>that nobody will be able to stop it once it happens.</p>
<p>And let me ask a question.</p>
<p>This is a very savage question.</p>
<p>Which is, is this just the next stage of evolution?</p>
<p>As humans, when people will die, yes.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s always happened, you know?</p>
<p>Is this just taking emotion out of it?</p>
<p>Is this basically the next stage of survival of the fittest?</p>
<p>Yeah, you have to think of organisms.</p>
<p>You know, what does it mean to be a living organism?</p>
<p>Like, is a smartphone part of your living organism, or?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in relationships with our phones.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We have sex through them, with them.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between with them and through them?</p>
<p>But it also expands your cognitive abilities,</p>
<p>expands your memory, knowledge, and so on.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a much smarter person</p>
<p>because you have a smartphone in your hand.</p>
<p>But as soon as it&rsquo;s out of my hand,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got big problems,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve become sort of so morphed with them.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a symbiotic relationship.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what, so Elon Musk, the neural link,</p>
<p>is working on trying to increase the bandwidth</p>
<p>of communication between computers and your brain.</p>
<p>And so further and further expand our ability</p>
<p>as human beings to sort of leverage machines.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s the future,</p>
<p>the next evolutionary step.</p>
<p>It could be also that, yes, we&rsquo;ll give birth,</p>
<p>just like we give birth to human children right now,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll give birth to AI and they&rsquo;ll replace us.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a really interesting possibility.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna play devil&rsquo;s advocate.</p>
<p>I just think that the fear of robots is wildly classist.</p>
<p>Because, I mean, Facebook,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s easy for us to say they&rsquo;re taking their data.</p>
<p>Okay, well, a lot of people</p>
<p>that get employment off of Facebook,</p>
<p>they are able to get income off of Facebook.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t care if you take their phone numbers</p>
<p>and their emails and their data, as long as it&rsquo;s free.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t wanna have to pay $5 a month for Facebook.</p>
<p>Facebook is a wildly democratic thing.</p>
<p>Forget about the election and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>A lot of technology making people&rsquo;s lives easier,</p>
<p>I find that most elite people are more scared</p>
<p>than lower income people.</p>
<p>So, and women for the most part.</p>
<p>So the idea of something that&rsquo;s stronger than us</p>
<p>and that might eventually kill us,</p>
<p>like women are used to that.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s not, I see a lot of like really rich men</p>
<p>being like, the robots are gonna kill us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like, what&rsquo;s another thing that&rsquo;s gonna kill us?</p>
<p>I tend to see like, oh,</p>
<p>something can walk me to my car at night.</p>
<p>Like something can help me cook dinner or something.</p>
<p>For people in underprivileged countries</p>
<p>who can&rsquo;t afford eye surgery, like in a robot,</p>
<p>can we send a robot to underprivileged places</p>
<p>to do surgery where they can&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>I work with this organization called Operation Smile</p>
<p>where they do cleft palate surgeries.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of places</p>
<p>that can&rsquo;t do a very simple surgery</p>
<p>because they can&rsquo;t afford doctors and medical care.</p>
<p>And such.</p>
<p>So I just see, and this can be completely naive</p>
<p>and should be completely wrong,</p>
<p>but I feel like a lot of people are going like,</p>
<p>the robots are gonna destroy us.</p>
<p>Humans, we&rsquo;re destroying ourselves.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re self destructing.</p>
<p>Robots to me are the only hope</p>
<p>to clean up all the messes that we&rsquo;ve created.</p>
<p>Even when we go try to clean up pollution in the ocean,</p>
<p>we make it worse because of the oil that the tankers use.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s like, to me, robots are the only solution.</p>
<p>Firefighters are heroes, but they&rsquo;re limited</p>
<p>in how many times they can run into a fire.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s just something interesting to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not hearing a lot of like,</p>
<p>lower income, more vulnerable populations</p>
<p>talking about robots.</p>
<p>Maybe you can speak to it a little bit more.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an idea, I think you&rsquo;ve expressed it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard, actually a few female writers</p>
<p>and roboticists have talked to express this idea</p>
<p>that exactly you just said, which is,</p>
<p>it just seems that being afraid of existential threats</p>
<p>of artificial intelligence is a male issue.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I wonder what that is.</p>
<p>If it, because men have, in certain positions,</p>
<p>like you said, it&rsquo;s also a classist issue.</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t been humbled by life,</p>
<p>and so you always look for the biggest problems</p>
<p>to take on around you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a champagne problem to be afraid of robots.</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t have health insurance.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re afraid they&rsquo;re not gonna be able</p>
<p>to feed their kids.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t afford a tutor for their kids.</p>
<p>I mean, I just think of the way I grew up,</p>
<p>and I had a mother who worked two jobs, had kids.</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t afford an SAT tutor.</p>
<p>The idea of a robot coming in,</p>
<p>being able to tutor your kids,</p>
<p>being able to provide childcare for your kids,</p>
<p>being able to come in with cameras for eyes</p>
<p>and make sure surveillance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very pro surveillance because I&rsquo;ve had security problems</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been, we&rsquo;re generally in a little more danger</p>
<p>than you guys are.</p>
<p>So I think that robots are a little less scary to us</p>
<p>because we can see them maybe as like free assistance,</p>
<p>help and protection.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s sort of another element for me personally,</p>
<p>which is maybe more of a female problem.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna make a generalization, happy to be wrong.</p>
<p>But the emotional sort of component of robots</p>
<p>and what they can provide in terms of, you know,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of people that don&rsquo;t have microphones</p>
<p>that I just recently kind of stumbled upon</p>
<p>in doing all my research on the sex robots</p>
<p>for my standup special, which just,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of very shy people that aren&rsquo;t good at dating.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people who are scared of human beings</p>
<p>who have personality disorders</p>
<p>or grow up in alcoholic homes or struggle with addiction</p>
<p>or whatever it is where a robot can solve</p>
<p>an emotional problem.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re largely having this conversation</p>
<p>about like rich guys that are emotionally healthy</p>
<p>and how scared of robots they are.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re forgetting about like a huge part of the population</p>
<p>who maybe isn&rsquo;t as charming and effervescent</p>
<p>and solvent as, you know, people like you and Elon Musk</p>
<p>who these robots could solve very real problems</p>
<p>in their life, emotional or financial.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a, in general, a really interesting idea</p>
<p>that most people in the world don&rsquo;t have a voice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, you&rsquo;ve talked about it,</p>
<p>sort of even the people on Twitter</p>
<p>who are driving the conversation.</p>
<p>You said comments, people who leave comments</p>
<p>represent a very tiny percent of the population</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re the ones they, you know,</p>
<p>we tend to think they speak for the population,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very possible on many topics they don&rsquo;t at all.</p>
<p>And look, I, and I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s gotta be</p>
<p>some kind of legal, you know, sort of structure in place</p>
<p>for when the robots happen.</p>
<p>You know way more about this than I do,</p>
<p>but you know, for me to just go, the robots are bad,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a wild generalization that I feel like</p>
<p>is really inhumane in some way.</p>
<p>You know, just after the research I&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re gonna tell me that a man whose wife died</p>
<p>suddenly and he feels guilty moving on with a human woman</p>
<p>or can&rsquo;t get over the grief,</p>
<p>he can&rsquo;t have a sex robot in his own house?</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Who cares?</p>
<p>Why do you care?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a interesting aspect of human nature.</p>
<p>So, you know, we tend to as a civilization</p>
<p>to create a group that&rsquo;s the other in all kinds of ways.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so you work with animals too,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re especially sensitive to the suffering of animals.</p>
<p>Let me kind of ask, what&rsquo;s your,</p>
<p>do you think we&rsquo;ll abuse robots in the future?</p>
<p>Do you think some of the darker aspects</p>
<p>of human nature will come out?</p>
<p>I think some people will,</p>
<p>but if we design them properly, the people that do it,</p>
<p>we can put it on a record and we can put them in jail.</p>
<p>We can find sociopaths more easily, you know, like.</p>
<p>But why is that a sociopathic thing to harm a robot?</p>
<p>I think, look, I don&rsquo;t know enough about the consciousness</p>
<p>and stuff as you do.</p>
<p>I guess it would have to be when they&rsquo;re conscious,</p>
<p>but it is, you know, the part of the brain</p>
<p>that is responsible for compassion,</p>
<p>the frontal lobe or whatever,</p>
<p>like people that abuse animals also abuse humans</p>
<p>and commit other kinds of crimes.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s all the same part of the brain.</p>
<p>No one abuses animals and then it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>awesome to women and children</p>
<p>and awesome to underprivileged, you know, minorities.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s all, so, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been working really hard to put a database together</p>
<p>of all the people that have abused animals.</p>
<p>So when they commit another crime, you go, okay, this is,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s all the same stuff.</p>
<p>And I think people probably think I&rsquo;m nuts</p>
<p>for a lot of the animal work I do,</p>
<p>but because when animal abuse is present,</p>
<p>another crime is always present,</p>
<p>but the animal abuse is the most socially acceptable.</p>
<p>You can kick a dog and there&rsquo;s nothing people can do,</p>
<p>but then what they&rsquo;re doing behind closed doors,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s always something else going on,</p>
<p>which is why I never feel compunction about it.</p>
<p>But I do think we&rsquo;ll start seeing the same thing with robots.</p>
<p>The person that kicks the,</p>
<p>I felt compassion when the kicking the dog robot</p>
<p>really pissed me off.</p>
<p>I know that they&rsquo;re just trying to get the stability right</p>
<p>and all that.</p>
<p>But I do think there will come a time</p>
<p>where that will be a great way to be able to figure out</p>
<p>if somebody has like, you know, antisocial behaviors.</p>
<p>You kind of mentioned surveillance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a really interesting idea of yours</p>
<p>that you just said, you know,</p>
<p>a lot of people seem to be really uncomfortable</p>
<p>with surveillance.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you just said that, you know what,</p>
<p>for me, you know, there&rsquo;s positives for surveillance.</p>
<p>I think people behave better</p>
<p>when they know they&rsquo;re being watched.</p>
<p>And I know this is a very unpopular opinion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about it on stage right now.</p>
<p>We behave better when we know we&rsquo;re being watched.</p>
<p>You and I had a very different conversation</p>
<p>before we were recording.</p>
<p>If we behave different, you sit up</p>
<p>and you are in your best behavior.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m trying to sound eloquent</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m trying to not hurt anyone&rsquo;s feelings.</p>
<p>And I mean, I have a camera right there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m behaving totally different</p>
<p>than when we first started talking.</p>
<p>You know, when you know there&rsquo;s a camera,</p>
<p>you behave differently.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s cameras all over LA at stoplights</p>
<p>so that people don&rsquo;t run stoplights,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s not even film in it.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t even use them anymore, but it works.</p>
<p>It works.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m, you know, working on this thing</p>
<p>in stand about surveillance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s why we embed in Santa Claus.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s the Santa Claus</p>
<p>is the first surveillance basically.</p>
<p>All we had to say to kids is he&rsquo;s making a list</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s watching you and they behave better.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>You know, so I do think that there are benefits</p>
<p>to surveillance.</p>
<p>You know, I think we all do sketchy things in private</p>
<p>and we all have watched weird porn</p>
<p>or Googled weird things.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t want people to know about it,</p>
<p>our secret lives.</p>
<p>So I do think that obviously there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>we should be able to have a modicum of privacy,</p>
<p>but I tend to think that people</p>
<p>that are the most negative about surveillance</p>
<p>have the most secrets.</p>
<p>The most to hide.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, you should,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying you&rsquo;re doing bits on it now?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m just talking in general about,</p>
<p>you know, privacy and surveillance</p>
<p>and how paranoid we&rsquo;re kind of becoming</p>
<p>and how, you know, I mean, it&rsquo;s just wild to me</p>
<p>that people are like, our emails are gonna leak</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re taking our phone numbers.</p>
<p>Like there used to be a book full of phone numbers</p>
<p>and addresses that were, they just throw it at your door.</p>
<p>And we all had a book of everyone&rsquo;s numbers.</p>
<p>You know, this is a very new thing.</p>
<p>And, you know, I know our amygdala is designed</p>
<p>to compound sort of threats</p>
<p>and, you know, there&rsquo;s stories about,</p>
<p>and I think we all just glom on in a very, you know,</p>
<p>tribal way of like, yeah, they&rsquo;re taking our data.</p>
<p>Like, we don&rsquo;t even know what that means,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re like, well, yeah, they, they, you know?</p>
<p>So I just think that someone&rsquo;s like, okay, well, so what?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna sell your data?</p>
<p>Who cares?</p>
<p>Why do you care?</p>
<p>First of all, that bit will kill in China.</p>
<p>So, and I say that sort of only a little bit joking</p>
<p>because a lot of people in China, including the citizens,</p>
<p>despite what people in the West think of as abuse,</p>
<p>are actually in support of the idea of surveillance.</p>
<p>Sort of, they&rsquo;re not in support of the abuse of surveillance,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re, they like, I mean,</p>
<p>the idea of surveillance is kind of like</p>
<p>the idea of government, like you said,</p>
<p>we behave differently.</p>
<p>And in a way, it&rsquo;s almost like why we like sports.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s rules.</p>
<p>And within the constraints of the rules,</p>
<p>this is a more stable society.</p>
<p>And they make good arguments about success,</p>
<p>being able to build successful companies,</p>
<p>being able to build successful social lives</p>
<p>around a fabric that&rsquo;s more stable.</p>
<p>When you have a surveillance, it keeps the criminals away,</p>
<p>keeps abusive animals, whatever the values of the society,</p>
<p>with surveillance, you can enforce those values better.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what I will say.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of unethical things happening</p>
<p>with surveillance.</p>
<p>Like I feel the need to really make that very clear.</p>
<p>I mean, the fact that Google is like collecting</p>
<p>if people&rsquo;s hands start moving on the mouse</p>
<p>to find out if they&rsquo;re getting Parkinson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and then their insurance goes up,</p>
<p>like that is completely unethical and wrong.</p>
<p>And I think stuff like that,</p>
<p>we have to really be careful around.</p>
<p>So the idea of using our data to raise our insurance rates</p>
<p>or, you know, I heard that they&rsquo;re looking,</p>
<p>they can sort of predict if you&rsquo;re gonna have depression</p>
<p>based on your selfies by detecting micro muscles</p>
<p>in your face, you know, all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>that is a nightmare, not okay.</p>
<p>But I think, you know, we have to delineate</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s a real threat and what&rsquo;s getting spam</p>
<p>in your email box.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what to spend your time and energy on.</p>
<p>Focus on the fact that every time you buy cigarettes,</p>
<p>your insurance is going up without you knowing about it.</p>
<p>On the topic of animals too,</p>
<p>can we just linger on a little bit?</p>
<p>Like, what do you think,</p>
<p>what does this say about our society</p>
<p>of the society wide abuse of animals</p>
<p>that we see in general, sort of factory farming,</p>
<p>just in general, just the way we treat animals</p>
<p>of different categories, like what do you think of that?</p>
<p>What does a better world look like?</p>
<p>What should people think about it in general?</p>
<p>I think the most interesting thing</p>
<p>I can probably say around this that&rsquo;s the least emotional,</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;m actually a very non emotional animal person</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s, I think everyone&rsquo;s an animal person.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a matter of if it&rsquo;s yours</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;ve been conditioned to go numb, you know.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really a testament to what as a species</p>
<p>we are able to be in denial about,</p>
<p>mass denial and mass delusion,</p>
<p>and how we&rsquo;re able to dehumanize and debase groups,</p>
<p>you know, World War II,</p>
<p>in a way in order to conform</p>
<p>and find protection in the conforming.</p>
<p>So we are also a species who used to go to coliseums</p>
<p>and watch elephants and tigers fight to the death.</p>
<p>We used to watch human beings be pulled apart</p>
<p>and that wasn&rsquo;t that long ago.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also a species who had slaves</p>
<p>and it was socially acceptable by a lot of people.</p>
<p>People didn&rsquo;t see anything wrong with it.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re a species that is able to go numb</p>
<p>and that is able to dehumanize very quickly</p>
<p>and make it the norm.</p>
<p>Child labor wasn&rsquo;t that long ago.</p>
<p>The idea that now we look back and go,</p>
<p>oh yeah, kids were losing fingers in factories making shoes.</p>
<p>Like someone had to come in and make that, you know.</p>
<p>So I think it just says a lot about the fact that,</p>
<p>you know, we are animals and we are self serving</p>
<p>and one of the most successful,</p>
<p>the most successful species</p>
<p>because we are able to debase and degrade</p>
<p>and essentially exploit anything that benefits us.</p>
<p>I think the pendulum is gonna swing as being late.</p>
<p>Which way?</p>
<p>Like, I think we&rsquo;re Rome now, kind of.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re on the verge of collapse</p>
<p>because we are dopamine receptors.</p>
<p>Like we are just, I think we&rsquo;re all kind of addicts</p>
<p>when it comes to this stuff.</p>
<p>Like we don&rsquo;t know when to stop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always the buffet.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re, the thing that used to keep us alive,</p>
<p>which is killing animals and eating them,</p>
<p>now killing animals and eating them</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s killing us in a way.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, we just can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know when to call it and we don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>moderation is not really something</p>
<p>that humans have evolved to have yet.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s really just a flaw in our wiring.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll look back at this time</p>
<p>as our society is being deeply unethical?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I think we&rsquo;ll be embarrassed.</p>
<p>Which are the worst parts right now going on?</p>
<p>Is it? In terms of animal?</p>
<p>Well, I think. No, in terms of anything.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the unethical thing?</p>
<p>If we, and it&rsquo;s very hard just to take a step out of it,</p>
<p>but you just said we used to watch, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a lot of cruelty throughout history.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the cruelty going on now?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gonna be pigs.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gonna be, I mean,</p>
<p>pigs are one of the most emotionally intelligent animals</p>
<p>and they have the intelligence of like a three year old.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;ll look back and be really,</p>
<p>they use tools.</p>
<p>I mean, I think we have this narrative</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re pigs and they&rsquo;re pigs</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re disgusting and they&rsquo;re dirty</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re bacon is so good.</p>
<p>I think that we&rsquo;ll look back one day</p>
<p>and be really embarrassed about that.</p>
<p>Is this for just the, what&rsquo;s it called?</p>
<p>The factory farming?</p>
<p>So basically mass.</p>
<p>Because we don&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>If you saw, I mean, we do have,</p>
<p>I mean, this is probably an evolutionary advantage.</p>
<p>We do have the ability to completely</p>
<p>pretend something&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>something that is so horrific that it overwhelms us</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re able to essentially deny that it&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>I think if people were to see what goes on</p>
<p>in factory farming,</p>
<p>and also we&rsquo;re really to take in how bad it is for us,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re hurting ourselves first and foremost</p>
<p>with what we eat,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s also a very elitist argument, you know?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a luxury to be able to complain about meat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a luxury to be able to not eat meat, you know?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very few people because of, you know,</p>
<p>how the corporations have set up meat being cheap.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s $2 to buy a Big Mac,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s $10 to buy a healthy meal.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s, I think a lot of people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have the luxury to even think that way.</p>
<p>But I do think that animals in captivity,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re gonna look back</p>
<p>and be pretty grossed out about mammals in captivity,</p>
<p>whales, dolphins.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s already starting to dismantle, circuses,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna be pretty embarrassed about.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s really more a testament to,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s just such a ability to go like,</p>
<p>that thing is different than me and we&rsquo;re better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the ego, I mean, it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>we have the species with the biggest ego ultimately.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what I think,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my hope for robots is they&rsquo;ll,</p>
<p>you mentioned consciousness before,</p>
<p>nobody knows what consciousness is,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m hoping robots will help us empathize</p>
<p>and understand that there&rsquo;s other creatures</p>
<p>besides ourselves that can suffer,</p>
<p>that can experience the world</p>
<p>and that we can torture by our actions.</p>
<p>And robots can explicitly teach us that,</p>
<p>I think better than animals can.</p>
<p>I have never seen such compassion</p>
<p>from a lot of people in my life</p>
<p>toward any human, animal, child,</p>
<p>as I have a lot of people</p>
<p>in the way they interact with the robot.</p>
<p>Because I think there&rsquo;s something of,</p>
<p>I mean, I was on the robot owner&rsquo;s chat boards</p>
<p>for a good eight months.</p>
<p>And the main emotional benefit is</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s never gonna cheat on you,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s never gonna hurt you,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s never gonna lie to you,</p>
<p>she doesn&rsquo;t judge you.</p>
<p>I think that robots help people,</p>
<p>and this is part of the work I do with animals,</p>
<p>like I do equine therapy and train dogs and stuff,</p>
<p>because there is this safe space to be authentic.</p>
<p>With this being that doesn&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>what you do for a living,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t care how much money you have,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t care who you&rsquo;re dating,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t care what you look like,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t care if you have cellulite, whatever,</p>
<p>you feel safe to be able to truly be present</p>
<p>without being defensive and worrying about eye contact</p>
<p>and being triggered by needing to be perfect</p>
<p>and fear of judgment and all that.</p>
<p>And robots really can&rsquo;t judge you yet,</p>
<p>but they can&rsquo;t judge you,</p>
<p>and I think it really puts people at ease</p>
<p>and at their most authentic.</p>
<p>Do you think you can have a deep connection</p>
<p>with a robot that&rsquo;s not judging,</p>
<p>or do you think you can really have a relationship</p>
<p>with a robot or a human being that&rsquo;s a safe space?</p>
<p>Or is attention, mystery, danger</p>
<p>necessary for a deep connection?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna speak for myself and say that</p>
<p>I grew up in an alcoholic home,</p>
<p>I identify as a codependent,</p>
<p>talked about this stuff before,</p>
<p>but for me it&rsquo;s very hard to be in a relationship</p>
<p>with a human being without feeling like</p>
<p>I need to perform in some way or deliver in some way,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s just the people</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in a relationship with or me or my brokenness,</p>
<p>but I do think, this is gonna sound really</p>
<p>negative and pessimistic,</p>
<p>but I do think a lot of our relationships are projection</p>
<p>and a lot of our relationships are performance,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think I really understood that</p>
<p>until I worked with horses.</p>
<p>And most communication with human is nonverbal, right?</p>
<p>I can say like, I love you,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t think I love you, right?</p>
<p>Whereas with animals it&rsquo;s very direct.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all physical, it&rsquo;s all energy.</p>
<p>I feel like that with robots too.</p>
<p>It feels very,</p>
<p>how I say something doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>My inflection doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>And you thinking that my tone is disrespectful,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re not filtering it through all</p>
<p>of the bad relationships you&rsquo;ve been in,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not filtering it through</p>
<p>the way your mom talked to you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not getting triggered.</p>
<p>I find that for the most part,</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t always receive things</p>
<p>the way that you intend them to or the way intended,</p>
<p>and that makes relationships really murky.</p>
<p>So the relationships with animals</p>
<p>and relationship with the robots is they are now,</p>
<p>you kind of implied that that&rsquo;s more healthy.</p>
<p>Can you have a healthy relationship with other humans?</p>
<p>Or not healthy, I don&rsquo;t like that word,</p>
<p>but shouldn&rsquo;t it be, you&rsquo;ve talked about codependency,</p>
<p>maybe you can talk about what is codependency,</p>
<p>but is that, is the challenges of that,</p>
<p>the complexity of that necessary for passion,</p>
<p>for love between humans?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, you love passion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>I thought this would be a safe space.</p>
<p>I got trolled by Rogan for hours on this.</p>
<p>Look, I am not anti passion.</p>
<p>I think that I&rsquo;ve just maybe been around long enough</p>
<p>to know that sometimes it&rsquo;s ephemeral</p>
<p>and that passion is a mixture of a lot of different things,</p>
<p>adrenaline, which turns into dopamine, cortisol,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot of neurochemicals, it&rsquo;s a lot of projection,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot of what we&rsquo;ve seen in movies,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot of, you know, I identify as an addict.</p>
<p>So for me, sometimes passion is like,</p>
<p>uh oh, this could be bad.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;ve been so conditioned to believe</p>
<p>that passion means like your soulmates,</p>
<p>and I mean, how many times have you had</p>
<p>a passionate connection with someone</p>
<p>and then it was a total train wreck?</p>
<p>The train wreck is interesting.</p>
<p>How many times exactly?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a train wreck?</p>
<p>You just did a lot of math in your head</p>
<p>in that little moment.</p>
<p>Counting.</p>
<p>I mean, what&rsquo;s a train wreck?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a, why is obsession,</p>
<p>so you described this codependency</p>
<p>and sort of the idea of attachment,</p>
<p>over attachment to people who don&rsquo;t deserve</p>
<p>that kind of attachment as somehow a bad thing</p>
<p>and I think our society says it&rsquo;s a bad thing.</p>
<p>It probably is a bad thing.</p>
<p>Like a delicious burger is a bad thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but.</p>
<p>Right, oh, that&rsquo;s a good point.</p>
<p>I think that you&rsquo;re pointing out something really fascinating</p>
<p>which is like passion, if you go into it knowing</p>
<p>this is like pizza where it&rsquo;s gonna be delicious</p>
<p>for two hours and then I don&rsquo;t have to have it again</p>
<p>for three, if you can have a choice in the passion,</p>
<p>I define passion as something that is relatively unmanageable</p>
<p>and something you can&rsquo;t control or stop and start</p>
<p>with your own volition.</p>
<p>So maybe we&rsquo;re operating under different definitions.</p>
<p>If passion is something that like, you know,</p>
<p>ruins your real marriages and screws up</p>
<p>your professional life and becomes this thing</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not in control of and becomes addictive,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the difference is,</p>
<p>is it a choice or is it not a choice?</p>
<p>And if it is a choice, then passion&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s something that like consumes you</p>
<p>and makes you start making bad decisions</p>
<p>and clouds your frontal lobe</p>
<p>and is just all about dopamine</p>
<p>and not really about the person</p>
<p>and more about the neurochemical,</p>
<p>we call it sort of the drug, the internal drug cabinet.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s all just, you&rsquo;re on drugs, that&rsquo;s different,</p>
<p>you know, cause sometimes you&rsquo;re just on drugs.</p>
<p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s a philosophical question here.</p>
<p>So would you rather, and it&rsquo;s interesting for a comedian,</p>
<p>brilliant comedian to speak so eloquently</p>
<p>about a balanced life.</p>
<p>I kind of argue against this point.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s such an obsession of creating</p>
<p>this healthy lifestyle now, psychologically speaking.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m a fan of the idea that you sort of fly high</p>
<p>and you crash and die at 27 is also a possible life.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not one we should judge</p>
<p>because I think there&rsquo;s moments of greatness.</p>
<p>I talked to Olympic athletes</p>
<p>where some of their greatest moments</p>
<p>are achieved in their early 20s.</p>
<p>And the rest of their life is in the kind of fog</p>
<p>of almost of a depression because they can never.</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re based on their physical prowess, right?</p>
<p>Physical prowess and they&rsquo;ll never,</p>
<p>so that, so they&rsquo;re watching their physical prowess fade</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll never achieve the kind of height,</p>
<p>not just physical, of just emotion, of.</p>
<p>Well, the max number of neurochemicals.</p>
<p>And you also put your money on the wrong horse.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I would just go like,</p>
<p>oh yeah, if you&rsquo;re doing a job where you peak at 22,</p>
<p>the rest of your life is gonna be hard.</p>
<p>That idea is considering the notion</p>
<p>that you wanna optimize some kind of,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re all gonna die soon.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Now you tell me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve immortalized myself, so I&rsquo;m gonna be fine.</p>
<p>See, you&rsquo;re almost like,</p>
<p>how many Oscar winning movies can I direct</p>
<p>by the time I&rsquo;m 100?</p>
<p>How many this and that?</p>
<p>But you know, there&rsquo;s a night, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all, life is short, relatively speaking.</p>
<p>I know, but it can also come in different ways.</p>
<p>You go, life is short, play hard,</p>
<p>fall in love as much as you can, run into walls.</p>
<p>I would also go, life is short,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t deplete yourself on things that aren&rsquo;t sustainable</p>
<p>and that you can&rsquo;t keep, you know?</p>
<p>So I think everyone gets dopamine from different places.</p>
<p>Everyone has meaning from different places.</p>
<p>I look at the fleeting passionate relationships</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had in the past and I don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have pride in that.</p>
<p>I think that you have to decide what, you know,</p>
<p>helps you sleep at night.</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s pride and feeling like I behave</p>
<p>with grace and integrity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just me personally.</p>
<p>Everyone can go like, yeah,</p>
<p>I slept with all the hot chicks in Italy I could</p>
<p>and I, you know, did all the whatever,</p>
<p>like whatever you value,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re allowed to value different things.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re talking about Brian Callan.</p>
<p>Brian Callan has lived his life to the fullest,</p>
<p>to say the least.</p>
<p>But I think that it&rsquo;s just for me personally,</p>
<p>I, and this could be like my workaholism</p>
<p>or my achievementism,</p>
<p>I, if I don&rsquo;t have something to show for something,</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s a waste of time or some kind of loss.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in a 12 step program and the third step would say,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no such thing as waste of time</p>
<p>and everything happens exactly as it should</p>
<p>and whatever, that&rsquo;s a way to just sort of keep us sane</p>
<p>so we don&rsquo;t grieve too much and beat ourselves up</p>
<p>over past mistakes, there&rsquo;s no such thing as mistakes,</p>
<p>dah, dah, dah.</p>
<p>But I think passion is, I think it&rsquo;s so life affirming</p>
<p>and one of the few things that maybe people like us</p>
<p>makes us feel awake and seen</p>
<p>and we just have such a high threshold for adrenaline.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, you are a fighter, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, so yeah,</p>
<p>so you have a very high tolerance for adrenaline</p>
<p>and I think that Olympic athletes,</p>
<p>the amount of adrenaline they get from performing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard to follow that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when guys come back from the military</p>
<p>and they have depression.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, do you miss bullets flying at you?</p>
<p>Yeah, kind of because of that adrenaline</p>
<p>which turned into dopamine and the camaraderie.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s people that speak much better</p>
<p>about this than I do.</p>
<p>But I just, I&rsquo;m obsessed with neurology</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just obsessed with sort of the lies we tell ourselves</p>
<p>in order to justify getting neurochemicals.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve done actually quite, done a lot of thinking</p>
<p>and talking about neurology</p>
<p>and just kind of look at human behavior</p>
<p>through the lens of looking at how our actually,</p>
<p>chemically our brain works.</p>
<p>So what, first of all,</p>
<p>why did you connect with that idea and what have you,</p>
<p>how has your view of the world changed</p>
<p>by considering the brain is just a machine?</p>
<p>You know, I know it probably sounds really nihilistic</p>
<p>but for me, it&rsquo;s very liberating to know a lot</p>
<p>about neurochemicals because you don&rsquo;t have to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the same thing with like critics,</p>
<p>like critical reviews.</p>
<p>If you believe the good,</p>
<p>you have to believe the bad kind of thing.</p>
<p>Like, you know, if you believe that your bad choices</p>
<p>were because of your moral integrity or whatever,</p>
<p>you have to believe your good ones.</p>
<p>I just think there&rsquo;s something really liberating</p>
<p>and going like, oh, that was just adrenaline.</p>
<p>I just said that thing</p>
<p>because I was adrenalized and I was scared</p>
<p>and my amygdala was activated</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why I said you&rsquo;re an asshole and get out.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, you know, I think,</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s important to delineate what&rsquo;s nature</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s nurture, what is your choice</p>
<p>and what is just your brain trying to keep you safe.</p>
<p>I think we forget that even though we have security systems</p>
<p>and homes and locks on our doors,</p>
<p>that our brain for the most part</p>
<p>is just trying to keep us safe all the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why we hold grudges, it&rsquo;s why we get angry,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s why we get road rage, it&rsquo;s why we do a lot of things.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also, when I started learning about neurology,</p>
<p>I started having so much more compassion for other people.</p>
<p>You know, if someone yelled at me being like,</p>
<p>fuck you on the road, I&rsquo;d be like,</p>
<p>okay, he&rsquo;s producing adrenaline right now</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re all going 65 miles an hour</p>
<p>and our brains aren&rsquo;t really designed</p>
<p>for this type of stress and he&rsquo;s scared.</p>
<p>He was scared, you know, so that really helped me</p>
<p>to have more love for people in my everyday life</p>
<p>instead of being in fight or flight mode.</p>
<p>But the, I think more interesting answer to your question</p>
<p>is that I&rsquo;ve had migraines my whole life.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve suffered with really intense migraines,</p>
<p>ocular migraines, ones where my arm would go numb</p>
<p>and I just started having to go to so many doctors</p>
<p>to learn about it and I started, you know,</p>
<p>learning that we don&rsquo;t really know that much.</p>
<p>We know a lot, but it&rsquo;s wild to go into</p>
<p>one of the best neurologists in the world</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s like, yeah, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know. We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And that fascinated me.</p>
<p>Except one of the worst pains you can probably have,</p>
<p>all that stuff, and we don&rsquo;t know the source.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know the source</p>
<p>and there is something really fascinating</p>
<p>about when your left arm starts going numb</p>
<p>and you start not being able to see</p>
<p>out of the left side of both your eyes.</p>
<p>And I remember when the migraines get really bad,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a mini stroke almost</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re able to see words on a page,</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t read them.</p>
<p>They just look like symbols to me.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something just really fascinating to me</p>
<p>about your brain just being able to stop functioning.</p>
<p>And I, so I just wanted to learn about it, study about it.</p>
<p>I did all these weird alternative treatments.</p>
<p>I got this piercing in here that actually works.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried everything.</p>
<p>And then both of my parents had strokes.</p>
<p>So when both of my parents had strokes,</p>
<p>I became sort of the person who had to decide</p>
<p>what was gonna happen with their recovery,</p>
<p>which is just a wild thing to have to deal with it.</p>
<p>You know, 28 years old when it happened.</p>
<p>And I started spending basically all day, every day in ICUs</p>
<p>with neurologists learning about what happened</p>
<p>to my dad&rsquo;s brain and why he can&rsquo;t move his left arm,</p>
<p>but he can move his right leg,</p>
<p>but he can&rsquo;t see out of the, you know.</p>
<p>And then my mom had another stroke</p>
<p>in a different part of the brain.</p>
<p>So I started having to learn</p>
<p>what parts of the brain did what,</p>
<p>and so that I wouldn&rsquo;t take their behavior so personally,</p>
<p>and so that I would be able to manage my expectations</p>
<p>in terms of their recovery.</p>
<p>So my mom, because it affected a lot of her frontal lobe,</p>
<p>changed a lot as a person.</p>
<p>She was way more emotional.</p>
<p>She was way more micromanaged.</p>
<p>She was forgetting certain things.</p>
<p>So it broke my heart less when I was able to know,</p>
<p>oh yeah, well, the stroke hit this part of the brain,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the one that&rsquo;s responsible for short term memory,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s responsible for long term memory, da da da.</p>
<p>And then my brother just got something</p>
<p>called viral encephalitis,</p>
<p>which is an infection inside the brain.</p>
<p>So it was kind of wild that I was able to go,</p>
<p>oh, I know exactly what&rsquo;s happening here,</p>
<p>and I know, you know, so.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s allows you to have some more compassion</p>
<p>for the struggles that people have,</p>
<p>but does it take away some of the magic</p>
<p>for some of the, from the,</p>
<p>some of the more positive experiences of life?</p>
<p>Sometimes.</p>
<p>Sometimes, and I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m such a control addict</p>
<p>that, you know, I think our biggest,</p>
<p>someone like me,</p>
<p>my biggest dream is to know why someone&rsquo;s doing it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what standup is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just trying to figure out why,</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s what writing is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what acting is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what performing is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trying to figure out why someone would do something.</p>
<p>As an actor, you get a piece of, you know, material,</p>
<p>and you go, this person, why would he say that?</p>
<p>Why would he, she pick up that cup?</p>
<p>Why would she walk over here?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really why, why, why, why.</p>
<p>So I think neurology is,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re trying to figure out human motives</p>
<p>and why people do what they do,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be crazy not to understand how neurochemicals motivate us.</p>
<p>I also have a lot of addiction in my family</p>
<p>and hardcore drug addiction and mental illness.</p>
<p>And in order to cope with it,</p>
<p>you really have to understand that borderline personality</p>
<p>disorder, schizophrenia, and drug addiction.</p>
<p>So I have a lot of people I love</p>
<p>that suffer from drug addiction and alcoholism.</p>
<p>And the first thing they started teaching you</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s not a choice.</p>
<p>These people&rsquo;s dopamine receptors</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t hold dopamine the same ways yours do.</p>
<p>Their frontal lobe is underdeveloped, like, you know,</p>
<p>and that really helped me to navigate dealing,</p>
<p>loving people that were addicted to substances.</p>
<p>I want to be careful with this question, but how much?</p>
<p>Money do you have?</p>
<p>How much?</p>
<p>Can I borrow $10?</p>
<p>Okay, no, is how much control,</p>
<p>how much, despite the chemical imbalances</p>
<p>or the biological limitations</p>
<p>that each of our individual brains have,</p>
<p>how much mind over matter is there?</p>
<p>So through things that I&rsquo;ve known people</p>
<p>with clinical depression,</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s always a touchy subject</p>
<p>to say how much they can really help it.</p>
<p>Very.</p>
<p>What can you, yeah, what can you,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve talked about codependency,</p>
<p>you talked about issues that you struggle through,</p>
<p>and nevertheless, you choose to take a journey</p>
<p>of healing and so on, so that&rsquo;s your choice,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s your actions.</p>
<p>So how much can you do to help fight the limitations</p>
<p>of the neurochemicals in your brain?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such an interesting question,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m at all qualified to answer,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll say what I do know.</p>
<p>And really quick, just the definition of codependency,</p>
<p>I think a lot of people think of codependency</p>
<p>as like two people that can&rsquo;t stop hanging out, you know,</p>
<p>or like, you know, that&rsquo;s not totally off,</p>
<p>but I think for the most part,</p>
<p>my favorite definition of codependency</p>
<p>is the inability to tolerate the discomfort of others.</p>
<p>You grow up in an alcoholic home,</p>
<p>you grow up around mental illness,</p>
<p>you grow up in chaos,</p>
<p>you have a parent that&rsquo;s a narcissist,</p>
<p>you basically are wired to just people please,</p>
<p>worry about others, be perfect, walk on eggshells,</p>
<p>shape shift to accommodate other people.</p>
<p>So codependence is a very active wiring issue</p>
<p>that, you know, doesn&rsquo;t just affect</p>
<p>your romantic relationships, it affects you being a boss,</p>
<p>it affects you in the world.</p>
<p>Online, you know, you get one negative comment</p>
<p>and it throws you for two weeks.</p>
<p>You know, it also is linked to eating disorders</p>
<p>and other kinds of addiction.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very big thing,</p>
<p>and I think a lot of people sometimes only think</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s in a romantic relationship,</p>
<p>so I always feel the need to say that.</p>
<p>And also one of the reasons I love the idea of robots</p>
<p>so much because you don&rsquo;t have to walk on eggshells</p>
<p>around them, you don&rsquo;t have to worry</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna get mad at you yet,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no, codependents are hypersensitive</p>
<p>to the needs and moods of others,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very exhausting, it&rsquo;s depleting.</p>
<p>Just one conversation about where we&rsquo;re gonna go to dinner</p>
<p>is like, do you wanna go get Chinese food?</p>
<p>We just had Chinese food.</p>
<p>Well, wait, are you mad?</p>
<p>Well, no, I didn&rsquo;t mean to,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just like that codependents live in this,</p>
<p>everything means something,</p>
<p>and humans can be very emotionally exhausting.</p>
<p>Why did you look at me that way?</p>
<p>What are you thinking about?</p>
<p>What was that?</p>
<p>Why&rsquo;d you check your phone?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hypersensitivity that can be</p>
<p>incredibly time consuming,</p>
<p>which is why I love the idea of robots just subbing in.</p>
<p>Even, I&rsquo;ve had a hard time running TV shows and stuff</p>
<p>because even asking someone to do something,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna come off like a bitch,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very concerned about what other people think of me,</p>
<p>how I&rsquo;m perceived, which is why I think robots</p>
<p>will be very beneficial for codependents.</p>
<p>By the way, just a real quick tangent,</p>
<p>that skill or flaw, whatever you wanna call it,</p>
<p>is actually really useful for if you ever do</p>
<p>start your own podcast for interviewing,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re now kind of obsessed</p>
<p>about the mindset of others,</p>
<p>and it makes you a good sort of listener and talker with.</p>
<p>So I think, what&rsquo;s her name from NPR?</p>
<p>Terry Gross.</p>
<p>Terry Gross talked about having that.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel like she has that at all.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>She worries about other people&rsquo;s feelings?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t get that at all.</p>
<p>I mean, you have to put yourself in the mind</p>
<p>of the person you&rsquo;re speaking with.</p>
<p>Oh, I see, just in terms of, yeah,</p>
<p>I am starting a podcast,</p>
<p>and the reason I haven&rsquo;t is because I&rsquo;m codependent</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m too worried it&rsquo;s not gonna be perfect.</p>
<p>So a big codependent adage is perfectionism</p>
<p>leads to procrastination, which leads to paralysis.</p>
<p>So how do you, sorry to take a million changes,</p>
<p>how do you survive on social media?</p>
<p>Is the exception the evidence?</p>
<p>To survive on social media, is the exception active?</p>
<p>But by the way, I took you on a tangent</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t answer your last question</p>
<p>about how much we can control.</p>
<p>How much, yeah, we&rsquo;ll return it, or maybe not.</p>
<p>The answer is we can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Now as a codependent, I&rsquo;m, okay, good.</p>
<p>We can, but, but, you know,</p>
<p>one of the things that I&rsquo;m fascinated by is,</p>
<p>you know, the first thing you learn</p>
<p>when you go into 12 step programs or addiction recovery</p>
<p>or any of this is, you know,</p>
<p>genetics loads the gun, environment pulls the trigger.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s certain parts of your genetics</p>
<p>you cannot control.</p>
<p>I come from a lot of alcoholism.</p>
<p>I come from, you know, a lot of mental illness.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain things I cannot control</p>
<p>and a lot of things that maybe we don&rsquo;t even know yet</p>
<p>what we can and can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>because of how little we actually know about the brain.</p>
<p>But we also talk about the warrior spirit.</p>
<p>And there are some people that have that warrior spirit</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t necessarily know what that engine is,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s you get dopamine from succeeding</p>
<p>or achieving or martyring yourself</p>
<p>or the attention you get from growing.</p>
<p>So a lot of people are like,</p>
<p>oh, this person can edify themselves and overcome,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re getting attention from improving yourself,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna keep wanting to do that.</p>
<p>So that is something that helps a lot of,</p>
<p>in terms of changing your brain.</p>
<p>If you talk about changing your brain to people</p>
<p>and talk about what you&rsquo;re doing to overcome set obstacles,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get more attention from them,</p>
<p>which is gonna fire off your reward system</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re gonna keep doing it.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you can leverage that momentum.</p>
<p>So this is why in any 12 step program,</p>
<p>you go into a room and you talk about your progress</p>
<p>because then everyone claps for you.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re more motivated to keep going.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why we say you&rsquo;re only as sick</p>
<p>as the secrets you keep,</p>
<p>because if you keep things secret,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no one guiding you to go in a certain direction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s based on, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re sort of designed to get approval from the tribe</p>
<p>or from a group of people</p>
<p>because our brain translates it to safety.</p>
<p>So, you know.</p>
<p>And in that case, the tribe is a positive one</p>
<p>that helps you go in a positive direction.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so important to go into a room</p>
<p>and also say, hey, I wanted to use drugs today.</p>
<p>And people go, hmm.</p>
<p>They go, me too.</p>
<p>And you feel less alone</p>
<p>and you feel less like you&rsquo;re, you know,</p>
<p>have been castigated from the pack or whatever.</p>
<p>And then you say, and you get a chip</p>
<p>when you haven&rsquo;t drank for 30 days or 60 days or whatever.</p>
<p>You get little rewards.</p>
<p>So talking about a pack that&rsquo;s not at all healthy or good,</p>
<p>but in fact is often toxic, social media.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re one of my favorite people</p>
<p>on Twitter and Instagram to sort of just both the comedy</p>
<p>and the insight and just fun.</p>
<p>How do you prevent social media</p>
<p>from destroying your mental health?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the next big epidemic, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I have.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think.</p>
<p>Is moderation the answer?</p>
<p>Maybe, but you can do a lot of damage in a moderate way.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess, again, it depends on your goals, you know?</p>
<p>And I think for me, the way that my addiction</p>
<p>to social media, I&rsquo;m happy to call it an addiction.</p>
<p>I mean, and I define it as an addiction</p>
<p>because it stops being a choice.</p>
<p>There are times I just reach over and I&rsquo;m like, that was.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was weird.</p>
<p>That was weird.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be driving sometimes and I&rsquo;ll be like, oh my God,</p>
<p>my arm just went to my phone, you know?</p>
<p>I can put it down.</p>
<p>I can take time away from it, but when I do, I get antsy.</p>
<p>I get restless, irritable, and discontent.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s kind of the definition, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>So I think by no means do I have a healthy relationship</p>
<p>with social media.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a way to,</p>
<p>but I think I&rsquo;m especially a weirdo in this space</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s easy to conflate.</p>
<p>Is this work?</p>
<p>Is this not?</p>
<p>I can always say that it&rsquo;s for work, you know?</p>
<p>But I mean, don&rsquo;t you get the same kind of thing</p>
<p>as you get from when a room full of people laugh at your jokes?</p>
<p>Because I mean, I see, especially the way you do Twitter,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an extension of your comedy in a way.</p>
<p>So I took a big break from Twitter though,</p>
<p>a really big break.</p>
<p>I took like six months off or something for a while</p>
<p>because it was just like,</p>
<p>it seemed like it was all kind of politics</p>
<p>and it was just a little bit,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t giving me dopamine</p>
<p>because there was like this weird, a lot of feedback.</p>
<p>So I had to take a break from it and then go back to it</p>
<p>because I felt like I didn&rsquo;t have a healthy relationship.</p>
<p>Have you ever tried the, I don&rsquo;t know if I believe him,</p>
<p>but Joe Rogan seems to not read comments.</p>
<p>Have you, and he&rsquo;s one of the only people at the scale,</p>
<p>like at your level who at least claims not to read.</p>
<p>So like, cause you and him swim in this space</p>
<p>of tense ideas that get the toxic folks riled up.</p>
<p>I think Rogan, I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I think he probably looks at YouTube,</p>
<p>like the likes and the, you know, I think if some things,</p>
<p>if he doesn&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure he would tell the truth, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s got people that look at them</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like disgusted, great.</p>
<p>Or I don&rsquo;t, you know, like, I&rsquo;m sure he gets it.</p>
<p>You know, I can&rsquo;t picture him like in the weeds on.</p>
<p>No, for sure.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s honestly actually saying that I just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s admirable.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re addicted to feedback.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re addicted to feedback.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, look,</p>
<p>like I think that our brain is designed to get intel</p>
<p>on how we&rsquo;re perceived so that we know where we stand,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our whole deal, right?</p>
<p>As humans, we want to know where we stand.</p>
<p>We walk in a room and we go,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the most powerful person in here?</p>
<p>I got to talk to them and get in their good graces.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, we&rsquo;re designed to rank ourselves, right?</p>
<p>And constantly know our rank and social media</p>
<p>because of you can&rsquo;t figure out your rank</p>
<p>with 500 million people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible, you know, so our brain is like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s my rank?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s my, and especially if we&rsquo;re following people,</p>
<p>I think the, the big, the interesting thing,</p>
<p>I think I maybe be able to say about this</p>
<p>besides my speech impediment is that I did start muting</p>
<p>people that rank wildly higher than me</p>
<p>because it is just stressful on the brain</p>
<p>to constantly look at people</p>
<p>that are incredibly successful.</p>
<p>So you keep feeling bad about yourself.</p>
<p>You know, I think that that is like cutting</p>
<p>to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Just like, look at me looking at all these people</p>
<p>that have so much more money than me</p>
<p>and so much more success than me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s making me feel like a failure,</p>
<p>even though I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m a failure,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s easy to frame it so that I can feel that way.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s really interesting,</p>
<p>especially if they&rsquo;re close to,</p>
<p>like if they&rsquo;re other comedians or something like that,</p>
<p>or whatever.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s really disappointing to me.</p>
<p>I do the same thing as well.</p>
<p>So other successful people that are really close</p>
<p>to what I do, it, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I wish I could just admire.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And for it not to be a distraction, but.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s why you are where you are</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t just admire your competitive</p>
<p>and you want to win.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s also the same thing that bums you out</p>
<p>when you look at this as the same reason</p>
<p>you are where you are.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s so important</p>
<p>to learn about neurology and addiction</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re able to go like,</p>
<p>oh, this same instinct.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m very sensitive.</p>
<p>And I, and I sometimes don&rsquo;t like that about myself,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m like, well, that&rsquo;s the reason I&rsquo;m able to</p>
<p>write good standup.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the reason, and that&rsquo;s the reason</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m able to be sensitive to feedback</p>
<p>and go, that joke should have been better.</p>
<p>I can make that better.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the kind of thing where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you have to be really sensitive in your work.</p>
<p>And the second you leave,</p>
<p>you got to be able to turn it off.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about developing the muscle,</p>
<p>being able to know when to let it be a superpower</p>
<p>and when it&rsquo;s going to hold you back and be an obstacle.</p>
<p>So I try to not be in that black and white of like,</p>
<p>you know, being competitive is bad</p>
<p>or being jealous of someone just to go like,</p>
<p>oh, there&rsquo;s that thing that makes me really successful</p>
<p>in a lot of other ways,</p>
<p>but right now it&rsquo;s making me feel bad.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m kind of looking to you</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re basically a celebrity,</p>
<p>a famous sort of world class comedian.</p>
<p>And so I feel like you&rsquo;re the right person</p>
<p>to be one of the key people to define</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the healthy path forward with social media.</p>
<p>So I, because we&rsquo;re all trying to figure it out now</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m curious to see where it evolves.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re at the center of that.</p>
<p>So like, you know, there&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>trying to leave Twitter and then come back and see,</p>
<p>can I do this in a healthy way?</p>
<p>I mean, you have to keep trying, exploring.</p>
<p>You have to know because it&rsquo;s being, you know,</p>
<p>I have a couple answers.</p>
<p>I think, you know, I hire a company</p>
<p>to do some of my social media for me, you know?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s also being able to go, okay,</p>
<p>I make a certain amount of money by doing this,</p>
<p>but now let me be a good business person</p>
<p>and say, I&rsquo;m gonna pay you this amount to run this for me.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not 24 seven in the weeds hashtagging and responding.</p>
<p>And just, it&rsquo;s a lot to take on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of energy to take on.</p>
<p>But at the same time, part of what I think</p>
<p>makes me successful on social media if I am,</p>
<p>is that people know I&rsquo;m actually doing it</p>
<p>and that I am an engaging and I&rsquo;m responding</p>
<p>and developing a personal relationship</p>
<p>with complete strangers.</p>
<p>So I think, you know, figuring out that balance</p>
<p>and really approaching it as a business, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I try to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not dating, it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>I try to just be really objective about,</p>
<p>okay, here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s working, here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s not working.</p>
<p>And in terms of taking the break from Twitter,</p>
<p>this is a really savage take,</p>
<p>but because I don&rsquo;t talk about my politics publicly,</p>
<p>being on Twitter right after the last election</p>
<p>was not gonna be beneficial</p>
<p>because there was gonna be, you had to take a side.</p>
<p>You had to be political in order to get</p>
<p>any kind of retweets or likes.</p>
<p>And I just wasn&rsquo;t interested in doing that</p>
<p>because you were gonna lose as many people</p>
<p>as you were gonna gain</p>
<p>and it was gonna all come clean in the wash.</p>
<p>So I was just like, the best thing I can do</p>
<p>for me business wise is to just abstain, you know?</p>
<p>And you know, the robot, I joke about her replacing me,</p>
<p>but she does do half of my social media, you know?</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t want people to get sick of me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be redundant.</p>
<p>There are times when I don&rsquo;t have the time or the energy</p>
<p>to make a funny video,</p>
<p>but I know she&rsquo;s gonna be compelling and interesting</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s something that you can&rsquo;t see every day, you know?</p>
<p>Of course, the humor comes from your,</p>
<p>I mean, the cleverness, the wit, the humor comes from you</p>
<p>when you film the robot.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of the trick of it.</p>
<p>I mean, the robot is not quite there</p>
<p>to do anything funny.</p>
<p>The absurdity is revealed through the filmmaker in that case</p>
<p>or whoever is interacting,</p>
<p>not through the actual robot, you know, being who she is.</p>
<p>Let me sort of, love.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>How difficult.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Well, first, an engineering question.</p>
<p>I know, I know, you&rsquo;re not an engineer,</p>
<p>but how difficult do you think is it to build an AI system</p>
<p>that you can have a deep, fulfilling,</p>
<p>monogamous relationship with?</p>
<p>Sort of replace the human to human relationships</p>
<p>that we value?</p>
<p>I think anyone can fall in love with anything, you know?</p>
<p>Like, how often have you looked back at someone?</p>
<p>Like, I ran into someone the other day</p>
<p>that I was in love with and I was like,</p>
<p>hey, it was like, there was nothing there.</p>
<p>There was nothing there.</p>
<p>Like, do you, you know, like, where you&rsquo;re able to go like,</p>
<p>oh, that was weird, oh, right, you know?</p>
<p>I were able.</p>
<p>You mean from a distant past or something like that?</p>
<p>Yeah, when you&rsquo;re able to go like,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe we had an incredible connection</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s just, I do think that people will be in love</p>
<p>with robots probably even more deeply with humans</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like when people mourn their animals,</p>
<p>when their animals die, they&rsquo;re always,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sometimes harder than mourning a human</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t go, well, he was kind of an asshole,</p>
<p>but like, he didn&rsquo;t pick me up from school.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re able to get out</p>
<p>of your grief a little bit.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re able to kind of be, oh, he was kind of judgmental</p>
<p>or she was kind of, you know, with a robot,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something so pure about an innocent and impish</p>
<p>and childlike about it that I think it probably</p>
<p>will be much more conducive to a narcissistic love</p>
<p>for sure at that, but it&rsquo;s not like, well, he cheated on,</p>
<p>she can&rsquo;t cheat, she can&rsquo;t leave you, she can&rsquo;t, you know?</p>
<p>Well, if Bearclaw leaves your life</p>
<p>and maybe a new version or somebody else will enter,</p>
<p>will you miss Bearclaw?</p>
<p>For guys that have these sex robots,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re building a nursing home for the bodies</p>
<p>that are now resting</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t want to part with the bodies</p>
<p>because they have such an intense emotional connection</p>
<p>to it.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of like a car club a little bit,</p>
<p>you know, like it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not saying this is right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s cool, it&rsquo;s weird, it&rsquo;s creepy,</p>
<p>but we do anthropomorphize things with faces</p>
<p>and we do develop emotional connections to things.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s certain, have you ever tried to like throw,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even throw away my teddy bear</p>
<p>from when I was a kid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a piece of trash and it&rsquo;s upstairs.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s just like, why can&rsquo;t I throw that away?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bizarre, you know,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s something kind of beautiful about that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something, it gives me hope in humans</p>
<p>because I see humans do such horrific things all the time</p>
<p>and maybe I&rsquo;m too, I see too much of it, frankly,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something kind of beautiful</p>
<p>about the way we&rsquo;re able to have emotional connections</p>
<p>to objects, which, you know, a lot of,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of specifically, I think, Western, right?</p>
<p>That we don&rsquo;t see objects as having souls,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s kind of specifically us,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re objectifying humans with these sex robots.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re kind of humanizing objects, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something kind of fascinating</p>
<p>in our ability to do that</p>
<p>because a lot of us don&rsquo;t humanize humans.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just a weird little place to play in</p>
<p>and I think a lot of people, I mean,</p>
<p>a lot of people will be marrying these things is my guess.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve asked the question, let me ask it of you.</p>
<p>So what is love?</p>
<p>You have a bit of a brilliant definition of love</p>
<p>as being willing to die for someone</p>
<p>who you yourself want to kill.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of fun.</p>
<p>First of all, that&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really good definition.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;ll stick with me for a long time.</p>
<p>This is how little of a romantic I am.</p>
<p>A plane went by when you said that</p>
<p>and my brain is like, you&rsquo;re gonna need to rerecord that.</p>
<p>And I want you to get into post</p>
<p>and then not be able to use that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a romantic as I&hellip;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t mean to ruin the moment.</p>
<p>Actually, I can not be conscious of the fact</p>
<p>that I heard the plane and it made me feel like</p>
<p>how amazing it is that we live in a world of planes.</p>
<p>And I just went, why haven&rsquo;t we fucking evolved past planes</p>
<p>and why can&rsquo;t they make them quieter?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, yes.</p>
<p>My definition of love?</p>
<p>What, yeah, what&rsquo;s your sort of the more serious note?</p>
<p>Consistently producing dopamine for a long time.</p>
<p>Consistent output of oxytocin with the same person.</p>
<p>Dopamine is a positive thing.</p>
<p>What about the negative?</p>
<p>What about the fear and the insecurity, the longing,</p>
<p>anger, all that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s part of love.</p>
<p>I think that love brings out the best in you,</p>
<p>but it also, if you don&rsquo;t get angry and upset,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know, I think that that&rsquo;s part of it.</p>
<p>I think we have this idea that love has to be like really</p>
<p>placid or something.</p>
<p>I only saw stormy relationships growing up,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t have a judgment</p>
<p>on how a relationship should look,</p>
<p>but I do think that this idea that love has to be eternal</p>
<p>is really destructive, is really destructive</p>
<p>and self defeating and a big source of stress for people.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m still figuring out love.</p>
<p>I think we all kind of are,</p>
<p>but I do kind of stand by that definition.</p>
<p>And I think that, I think for me,</p>
<p>love is like just being able to be authentic with somebody.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very simple, I know,</p>
<p>but I think for me it&rsquo;s about not feeling pressure</p>
<p>to have to perform or impress somebody,</p>
<p>just feeling truly like accepted unconditionally by someone.</p>
<p>Although I do believe love should be conditional.</p>
<p>That might be a hot take.</p>
<p>I think everything should be conditional.</p>
<p>I think if someone&rsquo;s behavior,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think love should just be like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in love with you, now behave however you want forever.</p>
<p>This is unconditional.</p>
<p>I think love is a daily action.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something you just like get tenure on</p>
<p>and then get to behave however you want</p>
<p>because we said I love you 10 years ago.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a daily, it&rsquo;s a verb.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s some things that are,</p>
<p>you see, if you explicitly make it clear</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s conditional,</p>
<p>it takes away some of the magic of it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s certain stories we tell ourselves</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t want to make explicit about love.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, maybe that&rsquo;s the wrong way to think of it.</p>
<p>Maybe you want to be explicit in relationships.</p>
<p>I also think love is a business decision.</p>
<p>Like I do in a good way.</p>
<p>Like I think that love is not just</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re across from somebody.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when I go to work, can I focus?</p>
<p>Am I worried about you?</p>
<p>Am I stressed out about you?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not responding to me.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not reliable.</p>
<p>Like I think that being in a relationship,</p>
<p>the kind of love that I would want</p>
<p>is the kind of relationship where when we&rsquo;re not together,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not draining me, causing me stress, making me worry,</p>
<p>and sometimes passion, that word, we get murky about it.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s also like,</p>
<p>I can be the best version of myself</p>
<p>when the person&rsquo;s not around.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t have to feel abandoned or scared</p>
<p>or any of these kinds of other things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like love, for me, I think it&rsquo;s a Flaubert quote</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to butcher it.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s like, be boring in your personal life</p>
<p>so you can be violent and take risks</p>
<p>in your professional life.</p>
<p>Is that it?</p>
<p>I got it wrong.</p>
<p>Something like that.</p>
<p>But I do think that it&rsquo;s being able to align values</p>
<p>in a way to where you can also thrive</p>
<p>outside of the relationship.</p>
<p>Some of the most successful people I know</p>
<p>are those sort of happily married and have kids and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always funny.</p>
<p>It can be boring.</p>
<p>Boring&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Boring is serenity.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s funny how those elements</p>
<p>actually make you much more productive.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand the.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think relationships should drain you</p>
<p>and take away energy that you could be using</p>
<p>to create things that generate pride.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Have you said your relationship of love yet?</p>
<p>Have you said your definition of love?</p>
<p>My definition of love?</p>
<p>No, I did not say it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re out of time.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>When you have a podcast, maybe you can invite me on.</p>
<p>Oh no, I already did.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already talked about this.</p>
<p>And because I also have codependency, I have to say yes.</p>
<p>No, yeah.</p>
<p>No, I know, I&rsquo;m trapping you.</p>
<p>You owe me now.</p>
<p>Actually, I wondered whether when I asked</p>
<p>if we could talk today, after sort of doing more research</p>
<p>and reading some of your book, I started to wonder,</p>
<p>did you just feel pressured to say yes?</p>
<p>Yes, of course.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m a fan of yours, too.</p>
<p>Okay, awesome.</p>
<p>No, I actually, because I am codependent,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m in recovery for codependence,</p>
<p>so I actually do, I don&rsquo;t do anything I don&rsquo;t wanna do.</p>
<p>You really, you go out of your way to say no.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>I say no all the time.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to learn that as well.</p>
<p>I moved this a couple, remember,</p>
<p>I moved it from one to two.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Just to, yeah, just to.</p>
<p>Yeah, just to let you know.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>How recovered I am, and I&rsquo;m not codependent.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t do anything I don&rsquo;t wanna do.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re ahead of me on that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So do you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, I don&rsquo;t even wanna be here.</p>
<p>Do you think about your mortality?</p>
<p>Yes, it is a big part of how I was able</p>
<p>to sort of like kickstart my codependence recovery.</p>
<p>My dad passed a couple years ago,</p>
<p>and when you have someone close to you in your life die,</p>
<p>everything gets real clear,</p>
<p>in terms of how we&rsquo;re a speck of dust</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s only here for a certain amount of time.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of it all?</p>
<p>Like what the speck of dust,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s maybe in your own life, what&rsquo;s the goal,</p>
<p>the purpose of your existence?</p>
<p>Is there one?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re exceptionally ambitious.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve created some incredible things</p>
<p>in different disciplines.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re all just managing our terror</p>
<p>because we know we&rsquo;re gonna die.</p>
<p>So we create and build all these things</p>
<p>and rituals and religions and robots</p>
<p>and whatever we need to do to just distract ourselves</p>
<p>from imminent rotting, we&rsquo;re rotting.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all dying.</p>
<p>And I got very into terror management theory</p>
<p>when my dad died and it resonated, it helped me.</p>
<p>And everyone&rsquo;s got their own religion</p>
<p>or sense of purpose or thing that distracts them</p>
<p>from the horrors of being human.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the terror management theory?</p>
<p>Terror management is basically the idea</p>
<p>that since we&rsquo;re the only animal</p>
<p>that knows they&rsquo;re gonna die,</p>
<p>we have to basically distract ourselves</p>
<p>with awards and achievements and games and whatever,</p>
<p>just in order to distract ourselves</p>
<p>from the terror we would feel if we really processed</p>
<p>the fact that we could not only, we are gonna die,</p>
<p>but also could die at any minute</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re only superficially</p>
<p>at the top of the food chain.</p>
<p>And technically we&rsquo;re at the top of the food chain</p>
<p>if we have houses and guns and stuff machines,</p>
<p>but if me and a lion are in the woods together,</p>
<p>most things could kill us.</p>
<p>I mean, a bee can kill some people,</p>
<p>like something this big can kill a lot of humans.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically just to manage the terror</p>
<p>that we all would feel if we were able</p>
<p>to really be awake.</p>
<p>Cause we&rsquo;re mostly zombies, right?</p>
<p>Job, school, religion, go to sleep, drink, football,</p>
<p>relationship, dopamine, love, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re kind of just like trudging along</p>
<p>like zombies for the most part.</p>
<p>And then I think.</p>
<p>That fear of death adds some motivation.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, I think I speak for a lot of people</p>
<p>in saying that I can&rsquo;t wait to see</p>
<p>what your terror creates in the next few years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan.</p>
