<p>stuff that we&rsquo;re going to talk about and</p>
<p>I just like to Dive Right In</p>
<p>Steve who can blame you all right very</p>
<p>good let&rsquo;s go to social media and this</p>
<p>is Paradise Lost five is the handle</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re using and they would like to</p>
<p>know can you explain the benefits of dry</p>
<p>fasting can it make you look younger</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>dry fasting is when you&rsquo;re avoiding all</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>fluids right so you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re um</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not drinking any water you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>um putting any water on your body it</p>
<p>adds more stress uh you can&rsquo;t do it for</p>
<p>as long</p>
<p>and um I think it does produce some</p>
<p>really cool benefits if you can do it</p>
<p>um but the problem is with a lot of</p>
<p>people is that they don&rsquo;t have they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going into it with with maybe lowered</p>
<p>Health maybe lowered electrolytes it</p>
<p>might be too much of a stress so I would</p>
<p>only recommend that after you if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>done water fast for a period of time</p>
<p>then when you want to stop stop drinking</p>
<p>water then at that point</p>
<p>um you know you can try it out for a</p>
<p>short period of time and see how you</p>
<p>feel but it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this thing called epigenetics</p>
<p>which is um kind of a</p>
<p>a dose of stress that causes the body to</p>
<p>to do better it responds with all these</p>
<p>interesting uh genetic things that turn</p>
<p>on that help your survival just like</p>
<p>exercise and fasting and there&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>these things you can add</p>
<p>um cold therapy to make the body</p>
<p>stronger but I think that one&rsquo;s a pretty</p>
<p>extreme one that can work for certain</p>
<p>people if you work up to it but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that would be that would be one thing</p>
<p>you would do all right very good now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got the audience captivated</p>
<p>because last week we heard from Dr Berg</p>
<p>that only five seconds and 39 degree</p>
<p>water have you attempted this again Dr</p>
<p>Berg</p>
<p>oh yeah I&rsquo;m up to two minutes uh in 50</p>
<p>degrees Fahrenheit 10 10 degree uh</p>
<p>Celsius and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s painful but um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s doable it&rsquo;s like um the Pain&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still there but like I have more</p>
<p>tolerance to it so it&rsquo;s working and I</p>
<p>love it in fact you you Steve I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be amazed at what it does to even</p>
<p>your mood and your cognitive function</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like dramatic and uh</p>
<p>um I didn&rsquo;t think I would like it as</p>
<p>much as I do but I I&rsquo;m gonna keep doing</p>
<p>it because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s so darn painful</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so great when you stop doing it but</p>
<p>you know you compared to</p>
<p>um like either a sauna or a</p>
<p>um a Jacuzzi which is really comfortable</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>pain that um</p>
<p>that genetic uh freezing connection that</p>
<p>probably our ancestors developed all</p>
<p>sorts of survival mechanisms that kind</p>
<p>of kick in</p>
<p>um you know out of all the things that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done I haven&rsquo;t really focused too</p>
<p>much on this cold water therapy as much</p>
<p>as I am now and I&rsquo;m like wow it&rsquo;s quite</p>
<p>amazing what it can do to I mean you</p>
<p>could even I&rsquo;m going to release the</p>
<p>video on it as well like what it can do</p>
<p>to your genetics</p>
<p>um and you don&rsquo;t even need to get a tub</p>
<p>you can just do the cold shower or jump</p>
<p>in the pond in your backyard but the</p>
<p>point is that it&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s uh fascinating short bursts of this</p>
<p>ice cold even like 11 minutes per week</p>
<p>it sounds easy but um</p>
<p>you know I like it I like it a lot wow</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s incredible we&rsquo;ve got a couple of</p>
<p>guests in The Green Room Katrina from</p>
<p>Sweden and then Clayton who has the</p>
<p>nerve to live in Wisconsin so they know</p>
<p>about cold I&rsquo;m sure and we&rsquo;ll hear more</p>
<p>about that now whether Clayton jumps in</p>
<p>a lake every morning is another question</p>
<p>but anyway so we&rsquo;ll get to them after a</p>
<p>while let&rsquo;s go back to social media and</p>
<p>find out that in addition to to uh</p>
<p>Sweden and Wisconsin we have other</p>
<p>people watching the show and we&rsquo;d like</p>
<p>to give a shout out to them so we&rsquo;ll say</p>
<p>good morning to all our viewers joining</p>

<p>America what an amazing audience and all</p>
<p>of them are celebrating uh you know</p>
<p>having such a great time on keto and</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see I know we had a wonderful</p>
<p>comment oh here is Kenneth is an example</p>
<p>from YouTube I&rsquo;ve been doing a 20-hour</p>
<p>fast every day since January 19th and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lost 39 pounds thank you Dr Berg so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an example</p>
<p>and of course Dr Burke there are</p>
<p>thousands of testimonials of success</p>
<p>stories where do people find those</p>
<p>at the website we actually have a thick</p>
<p>uh just under 8 000 process stores so um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s uh let&rsquo;s you know that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great start you know we we definitely</p>
<p>want to go to</p>
<p>um ten thousand uh it has a better ring</p>
<p>to it so we&rsquo;re trying to figure out how</p>
<p>to help more people and I know people</p>
<p>know friends and family or even you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>probably watching like</p>
<p>you know you keep running into something</p>
<p>that stops you please please write that</p>
<p>down below I&rsquo;m very interested in any</p>
<p>barriers that you might have in starting</p>
<p>keto or even doing keto successfully I</p>
<p>really want to know</p>
<p>um because</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>my my viewpoint is I&rsquo;m doing a certain</p>
<p>thing well that&rsquo;s because I know it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>cold but other people might not know uh</p>
<p>how to do this or that so</p>
<p>um definitely comment down below all</p>
<p>right very good well I want to help too</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m going to embellish my health</p>
<p>Journey a little bit leave the donuts</p>
<p>out and so on and come up with some</p>
<p>spectacular numbers so stand by for that</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s move along now Judith</p>
<p>from YouTube could you please recommend</p>
<p>the best supplements for uh osteoporosis</p>
<p>I am taking the Prolia shots twice a</p>
<p>year whatever that is</p>
<p>to build</p>
<p>um bone if you have osteoporosis it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a quick thing you can do it it takes</p>
<p>probably six years and but you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have to</p>
<p>feed that part of your body</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>trace minerals a really good trace</p>
<p>mineral blend</p>
<p>um and of course calcium I would</p>
<p>recommend the type of calcium that that</p>
<p>I talk about in my video I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>get too much into the woods but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>just it&rsquo;s not just minerals and calcium</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>um the fat soluble vitamins like vitamin</p>
<p>K2 and vitamin D</p>
<p>A lot of these minerals</p>
<p>that we take especially like calcium you</p>
<p>need like vitamin D to help them be</p>
<p>absorbed and vitamin D helps calcium</p>
<p>absorption by 20x so you imagine if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re low in D and you&rsquo;re trying to get</p>
<p>your bones fixed it&rsquo;s not going to</p>
<p>happen because you don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>transport so you need all the different</p>
<p>things that are connected and it could</p>
<p>also be an estrogen problem it could</p>
<p>also be a high cortisol problem related</p>
<p>to the Bone</p>
<p>um but I just I would just watch my</p>
<p>video that I talk about osteoporosis and</p>
<p>osteopenia but it does take some time</p>
<p>yeah very good here&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to make you cringe Dr Berg Jasmine from</p>
<p>YouTube what do you recommend for</p>
<p>someone with egg intolerance I mean Dr</p>
<p>Berg loves those eggs</p>
<p>well um I&rsquo;m guessing you have an allergy</p>
<p>or just an intolerance</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>I think um</p>
<p>if you</p>
<p>had an early vaccine that had egg in it</p>
<p>um and it created a kind of past the</p>
<p>bypassed the normal immigration to your</p>
<p>stomach it can develop allergies</p>
<p>uh to that you can develop antibodies</p>
<p>the same thing that they have</p>
<p>um peanut particles in vaccines says an</p>
<p>additional supplement all of a sudden</p>
<p>not a supplement but just additional</p>
<p>material then all of a sudden you</p>
<p>develop allergies to so it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>important um</p>
<p>to know that connection because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a a big spike in people with allergies</p>
<p>to certain things after</p>
<p>um this new round of vaccines but the</p>
<p>point is that if you do have an allergy</p>
<p>you can avoid it or an intolerance avoid</p>
<p>it for a period of time and then slowly</p>
<p>introduce it over time because the egg</p>
<p>is is the perfect food if you uh if you</p>
<p>have the uh the quality egg that I</p>
<p>recommend which is the pasture-raised</p>
<p>organic eggs</p>
<p>boy um I&rsquo;m sure uh Steve you have a lot</p>
<p>of eggs I I consume a tremendous amount</p>
<p>of eggs</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>per per week it&rsquo;s crazy because we we</p>
<p>have too many we have uh I think we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>down to 12 chickens I mean we can&rsquo;t keep</p>
<p>up with all these eggs being produced</p>
<p>every day so</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to figure out what to do</p>
<p>with all these extra eggs well when I</p>
<p>was a kid you don&rsquo;t want to put all your</p>
<p>eggs in that one basket Steve no you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t when I was a kid I used to throw</p>
<p>them at cop cars but I don&rsquo;t recommend</p>
<p>that for the rest of the audience</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re much more mature I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>all right very good let&rsquo;s uh move on to</p>
<p>our first question for the day and Dr</p>
<p>Berg this is an exciting true faucer</p>
<p>there you go</p>
<p>okay drifos shift workers</p>
<p>puts you at or shift work puts you at</p>
<p>risk for cardiovascular disease the same</p>
<p>risk for cardiovascular disease as</p>
<p>smoking</p>
<p>all right let me clear that out for you</p>
<p>okay audience jump on that true false of</p>
<p>course 50 50 chance of being brilliant</p>
<p>those are always fun uh let&rsquo;s go back to</p>
<p>um our questions be marchbanks boy why</p>
<p>do they come up with these names is it</p>
<p>okay to be fasting while breastfeeding</p>
<p>it helps with losing the pregnancy</p>
<p>weight how might it affect an infant</p>
<p>um you could have just you&rsquo;ve got to</p>
<p>really make sure um if you&rsquo;re either</p>
<p>pregnant or breastfeeding that you have</p>
<p>all these sufficient nutrients that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like the most important thing and and</p>
<p>you can do that and maybe you just you</p>
<p>know do two big meals a day</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>um but I wouldn&rsquo;t start doing any type</p>
<p>of extreme fasting while you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>breastfeeding just want to make sure</p>
<p>that that child has the key nutrients</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad that you&rsquo;re breastfeeding</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>um that child&rsquo;s going to have a much</p>
<p>greater immune system and probably won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have any allergies down the road too so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what that child is fed in the early</p>
<p>years that is such a crucial thing with</p>
<p>a person&rsquo;s long-term health and</p>
<p>unfortunately we don&rsquo;t emphasize it</p>
<p>enough</p>
<p>all right very good well listen speaking</p>
<p>of cold I think it&rsquo;s only right that we</p>
<p>go to Sweden first and we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have Katrina joining us with news from</p>
<p>Sweden and also about her personal</p>
<p>health challenges</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the air with Dr bird</p>
<p>Katrina</p>
<p>thank you thank you for everything</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing I have a short question</p>
<p>should I be worried that my HDL</p>
<p>cholesterol has been lowered after a</p>
<p>year with healthy ketosis Ketone</p>
<p>intermittent fasting</p>
<p>so so basically it uh it went it went</p>
<p>too low and then they would people</p>
<p>people like oh my gosh that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good thing no no one said it it was too</p>
<p>low but it lowered and my LDL was higher</p>
<p>and but triglycerides were lower than a</p>
<p>year before</p>
<p>and I did omad</p>
<p>four days before I took the test so</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s why dale dale went off but</p>
<p>still I&rsquo;m thinking shouldn&rsquo;t the HDL be</p>
<p>really high as high as possible oh so</p>
<p>you said I thought you said uh okay so</p>
<p>your HDL went lower right yeah yeah</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>and then your L what did your LDL do uh</p>
<p>it went higher</p>
<p>now if we take a look at um what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening internally as you have</p>
<p>these LDL and HCL are just transport</p>
<p>units they&rsquo;re protein that are carrying</p>
<p>information in and out of the cell and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of things happening when</p>
<p>you start keto especially one meal a day</p>
<p>you have you have a release of</p>
<p>cholesterol that your body has to now</p>
<p>deal with</p>
<p>um I would highly recommend that you get</p>
<p>a test</p>
<p>um called the advanced lipid profile</p>
<p>test to to look at the particle size of</p>
<p>that LDL</p>
<p>and chances are you&rsquo;re going to find</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re a large buoyant particle</p>
<p>sizes of LDL because you&rsquo;re you have to</p>
<p>deal with this cholesterol so what is</p>
<p>your body going to do with it you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>burning fat where&rsquo;s it going to go</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably I&rsquo;m guessing</p>
<p>experiencing a lot of other benefits but</p>
<p>then this probably kind of startled you</p>
<p>and this comes up all the time even in</p>
<p>my wife so</p>
<p>um I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about it but if you</p>
<p>are worried about it I would do an</p>
<p>advanced lipid profile test the other</p>
<p>thing too is when you go get a um this</p>
<p>test done</p>
<p>um make sure that you really do the</p>
<p>fasting</p>
<p>um the day before so you go in there</p>
<p>because a lot of people like oh yeah I</p>
<p>had a shake right before I did the test</p>
<p>I did this I&rsquo;m like oh it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>completely invalid so</p>
<p>um the other point I want to bring up</p>
<p>and this is important is that uh your</p>
<p>lipid profiles your cholesterol and all</p>
<p>these other factors are highly</p>
<p>influenced with stress and that day</p>
<p>before you went to get a test anything</p>
<p>stress wise because stress will activate</p>
<p>adrenaline and cortisol and all of a</p>
<p>sudden now you&rsquo;re producing more sugar</p>
<p>and that can alter your entire lipid</p>
<p>profile and that&rsquo;s another thing that</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t talk about so um</p>
<p>yes and um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that that would be my answer yeah</p>
<p>can I just say I&rsquo;m not worried about the</p>
<p>LDL at all I was just worrying about the</p>
<p>HDL going down why do you think that</p>
<p>happens well I think if you think about</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening um you have they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>both</p>
<p>um transport units and when one tends to</p>
<p>go up the other one might go down but it</p>
<p>just tells me that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>your body is um right now emphasizing</p>
<p>um what are we going to do with this</p>
<p>this cholesterol how we&rsquo;re gonna um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the it&rsquo;s the cholesterol</p>
<p>um that has to be dealt with in your</p>
<p>bloodstream so it&rsquo;s like okay let&rsquo;s deal</p>
<p>with this right now versus the other</p>
<p>transport uh system also</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I would repeat that test in four weeks</p>
<p>and I think what happened is your HDL</p>
<p>will start going up</p>
<p>um HDL it&rsquo;s a factor it&rsquo;s not the most</p>
<p>important factor</p>
<p>um what about your triglycerides</p>
<p>really low 0.5 yeah yeah yeah so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like way more important yeah yeah I I</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re doing great um how do you</p>
<p>how do you feel overall oh fantastic</p>
<p>since I started with this Clarity energy</p>
<p>and my mood my sleep so my life has</p>
<p>actually changed a lot so thank you so</p>
<p>much and it&rsquo;s all up it&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s thanks to you and your hard work</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s great Someday I&rsquo;m gonna go I</p>
<p>want to visit Sweden because my</p>
<p>ancestors came from there and I&rsquo;d like</p>
<p>to see more about</p>
<p>um what&rsquo;s going on over there and I I</p>
<p>have no idea I heard it&rsquo;s so beautiful</p>
<p>but of course you know um until you go</p>
<p>there you don&rsquo;t really know no but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re so welcome and I will arrange</p>
<p>everything for you so no problem just</p>
<p>come here and you&rsquo;ll have millions of</p>
<p>people wanting to meet you and then you</p>
<p>can also check out all the great food we</p>
<p>have here and the natural yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m interested in awesome</p>
<p>okay most welcome</p>
<p>okay thank you very much</p>
<p>all right Katrina thanks for being such</p>
<p>a great guest and representing Sweden so</p>
<p>well uh and the audience is representing</p>
<p>uh us well by answering these questions</p>
<p>very quickly and the first question of</p>
<p>the day was a true falser shift work</p>
<p>puts you at the same risk for</p>
<p>cardiovascular disease is smoking that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>alarming</p>
<p>and uh 97 percent of our respondents say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true and three percent are holding</p>
<p>out and say it&rsquo;s false who&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually true now I want to clarify</p>
<p>something if you&rsquo;re doing a third shift</p>
<p>whatever and it&rsquo;s consistent right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a rotational shift that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>completely different because your body</p>
<p>can adapt to it and you can do fine</p>
<p>talking about the person that is</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re rotating their shifts right and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like I think even as some</p>
<p>um people that do like um</p>
<p>um certain work where they they&rsquo;re I</p>
<p>guess I can&rsquo;t think of an example right</p>
<p>now other than um</p>
<p>certain people to hospital they rotate</p>
<p>and they work third shift oh my goodness</p>
<p>does it really create a lot of oxidative</p>
<p>stress oxidative stress is um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something to do with something that</p>
<p>happens in the mitochondria where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>creating all these reactive things that</p>
<p>are damaging the body and then all night</p>
<p>long</p>
<p>the Sleep actually helps get rid of</p>
<p>those oxidative stress particles or</p>
<p>oxygen related reactive molecules so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s getting rid of those so if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have that sleep it builds up and</p>
<p>starts destroying things and creates</p>
<p>inflammation just means that you need a</p>
<p>lot more antioxidants to counter that</p>
<p>so um just another importance for sleep</p>
<p>and that rest but um</p>
<p>yeah so if you have to do the rotational</p>
<p>shifts you better</p>
<p>do other things to counter that</p>
<p>um as much as possible</p>
<p>all right very good random piano from</p>
<p>YouTube can I mix methylene blue with</p>
<p>spring water or does it have to be</p>
<p>purified</p>
<p>no no it could be with any water</p>
<p>um not a problem I put the electrolytes</p>
<p>in there because</p>
<p>um it doesn&rsquo;t taste that great and I use</p>
<p>a straw I had it this morning and uh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really interesting it&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>added cool thing for your cells and it</p>
<p>soaks up a lot of the</p>
<p>extra electrons that could be</p>
<p>generated from like oxidative stress</p>
<p>um and um</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>it you&rsquo;ll find that you&rsquo;ll probably have</p>
<p>more energy from it more oxygen and so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a lot of research on that</p>
<p>topic as well I did a video on it and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very interesting</p>
<p>actual medicine that&rsquo;s over the counter</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the first medications</p>
<p>that was in the medical</p>
<p>field so of course you can&rsquo;t patent it</p>
<p>now so they&rsquo;re not probably going to</p>
<p>recommend it but</p>
<p>they use it in all the emergency rooms</p>
<p>if someone has carbon monoxide poisoning</p>
<p>or cyanide poisoning because it helps</p>
<p>get oxygen to the cells</p>
<p>wow okay let&rsquo;s try getting a quiz</p>
<p>question to the audience and here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>number two for the day doc</p>
<p>okay how can someone eat whatever they</p>
<p>want and still lose weight</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure everyone wants to know that</p>
<p>Roman from YouTube I eat an avocado</p>
<p>every day but my cholesterol remains</p>
<p>High help</p>
<p>you know uh cholesterol um you realize</p>
<p>that your body makes cholesterol your</p>
<p>body actually makes 75 all the</p>
<p>cholesterol</p>
<p>um for a reason because it uh</p>
<p>it supports your brain function and it</p>
<p>helps as a precursor to make bile salts</p>
<p>and vitamin D so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re not eating the carbs</p>
<p>which generate more of the pathogenic</p>
<p>LDL I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about it um I would</p>
<p>I would just learn more about it so then</p>
<p>that way you&rsquo;re not freaking out but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know a lot of times your cholesterol</p>
<p>will increase because you&rsquo;re mobilizing</p>
<p>fat cells by losing weight and in that</p>
<p>fat cell you have a certain amount of</p>
<p>cholesterol that has to come out so your</p>
<p>cholesterol make may go up one of the</p>
<p>big Regulators of cholesterol is bile</p>
<p>salts so if you do have a problem with</p>
<p>your bile because maybe you have liver</p>
<p>fat or you you had your gallbladder</p>
<p>removed or it&rsquo;s sluggish that alone can</p>
<p>raise your cholesterol because now you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>the the thing that helps you eliminate</p>
<p>the excess cholesterol it&rsquo;s another area</p>
<p>that again A lot of people are not</p>
<p>focusing on</p>
<p>all right very good let&rsquo;s see um</p>
<p>poor Daisy from YouTube what would be</p>
<p>your recommendation for a six-year-old</p>
<p>with constipation she has been given</p>
<p>Miralax regularly but it&rsquo;s not working</p>
<p>please help a desperate grandma</p>
<p>yeah uh that medication has a lot of</p>
<p>side effects and for some of that young</p>
<p>to put someone on the medication instead</p>
<p>of like what what what is that child</p>
<p>missing you know do they have enough</p>
<p>potassium in the diet potassium is very</p>
<p>important B1 stimulates the peristalsis</p>
<p>I would first get them on the correct</p>
<p>diet I would also make sure part of that</p>
<p>diet includes maybe some fermented foods</p>
<p>like maybe pickles you know that would</p>
<p>be good or maybe a probiotic and it that</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>um after fixing the diet you know</p>
<p>getting rid of the refined grains and</p>
<p>sugars and stuff like that I would</p>
<p>um give them a very gentle maybe herbal</p>
<p>laxative maybe something like a smooth</p>
<p>move Smooth Move tea or something like</p>
<p>that just enough to keep things going</p>
<p>um not like a real strong one but just a</p>
<p>mild one in a tea form and keep working</p>
<p>with that but typically this problem is</p>
<p>Diet related and and um</p>
<p>you got to get the child on the right</p>
<p>basic eating plan</p>
<p>all right very good good luck Grandma</p>
<p>okay I&rsquo;m asking this next question only</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m challenging my pronunciation</p>
<p>skills and here we go Mimi from YouTube</p>
<p>can I treat seborrheic keratosis</p>
<p>internally it&rsquo;s starting to pop up all</p>
<p>over my body help did I say it right doc</p>
<p>yeah um again</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>check with your doctor before treating</p>
<p>any diseases</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a couple things related to</p>
<p>that condition that relate to a vitamin</p>
<p>A deficiency</p>
<p>which usually is not food related it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more gallbladder or liver you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>producing the bile to extract the</p>
<p>vitamin A as well as Vitamin D those two</p>
<p>vitamins right there also it could be a</p>
<p>vitamin B2 deficiency as well so the B</p>
<p>vitamins are important</p>
<p>um so the last point I would look at is</p>
<p>what about your ratios of omega-6 to</p>
<p>omega-3 more omega-3 fatty acids and</p>
<p>getting rid of the soy oil and the corn</p>
<p>oil and the cottonseed oil can greatly</p>
<p>help</p>
<p>um all skin problems and if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>deficient in omega-3 you definitely will</p>
<p>notice um</p>
<p>scaly dry flaky skin</p>
<p>and abnormal skin but vitamin A is</p>
<p>really the vitamin that helps you</p>
<p>differentiate the skin cells</p>
<p>the Keratin sites current carotocytes</p>
<p>and basically if you if you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>enough of that they tend to develop like</p>
<p>a abnormal cell</p>
<p>that looks kind of rough and dry</p>
<p>all right average guy what a humble</p>
<p>moniker for him average guy from YouTube</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started taking niacin and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>helped my blood pressure</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve read that too much can be bad</p>
<p>for the liver can you elaborate</p>
<p>the the research on that of course</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re scaring people because it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>very natural thing and it competes with</p>
<p>a lot of the cholesterol medications</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very potent at lowering</p>
<p>cholesterol</p>
<p>um and there&rsquo;s a lot of research on like</p>
<p>the positive but of course they have to</p>
<p>emphasize some of the negative which is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have to have large amounts of it</p>
<p>um but even then it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s fairly rare</p>
<p>to cause a liver problem but if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking the normal amounts of niacin</p>
<p>um even under 500 milligrams I highly</p>
<p>doubt you&rsquo;re ever going to have liver</p>
<p>problems I mean look at the look at the</p>
<p>benefits of niacin</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>niacin</p>
<p>for for schizophrenia for blood pressure</p>
<p>take a look at even the mitochondria the</p>
<p>the inside there you have this Krebs</p>
<p>cycle this whole biochemical pathway</p>
<p>um B3 is an necessary nutrient for that</p>
<p>cycle to work</p>
<p>um so it has a lot of important</p>
<p>functions and um</p>
<p>watch my video on us and because you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>learn a lot more about that</p>
<p>okay here&rsquo;s a follow-up question uh from</p>
<p>something you mentioned about shifts</p>
<p>Lita from YouTube my husband has been</p>
<p>working rotating shifts at a power plant</p>
<p>for 30 years he&rsquo;s working 12-hour shifts</p>
<p>a day and then nights how can we protect</p>
<p>him from the stress the schedule creates</p>
<p>the more that you do those shifts the</p>
<p>the better the diet has to be the the</p>
<p>more things you have to do to reduce</p>
<p>stress the more exercise you&rsquo;ll have to</p>
<p>do the more maybe recovery with other</p>
<p>naps the more nutrition you need to take</p>
<p>especially in the area of antioxidants</p>
<p>to counter this oxidative stress</p>
<p>um so vitamin C vitamin E things like</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>all right well good luck to you and</p>
<p>thanks for working so hard</p>
<p>to keep the lights on for all of us</p>
<p>all right Matthew from YouTube any tips</p>
<p>for getting young kids into a healthy</p>
<p>keto or should it be in a healthy keto</p>
<p>dog</p>
<p>you start them off very young before</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re teenagers because after that</p>
<p>point is too late</p>
<p>um but uh I don&rsquo;t know I think the best</p>
<p>thing too is to educate them early on as</p>
<p>much as possible and then also use a lot</p>
<p>of the substitute keto Foods so that way</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not deprived they have the</p>
<p>they can have these so-called pleasure</p>
<p>foods but in a healthy form I would do</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>um but I mean think about teenagers now</p>
<p>or even young kids they&rsquo;re on the ultra</p>
<p>processed Pathway to health problems I</p>
<p>mean there&rsquo;s so many they&rsquo;re consuming</p>
<p>drinking so much fructose and</p>
<p>garbage out there it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just headed for problems now</p>
<p>they might not notice any anything at</p>
<p>first and people often say well</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have a weight problem why</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t they eat that I&rsquo;m like it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>just about weight</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about health so more and more kids</p>
<p>are having younger kids are developing</p>
<p>fatty livers</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s becoming a problem and um</p>
<p>but I would suggest maybe starting over</p>
<p>having more kids and then starting them</p>
<p>off healthy early on so that way you can</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>experience that after I just give the</p>
<p>other kids away and let&rsquo;s start fresh</p>
<p>anyway</p>
<p>absolutely I had a a couple Russian wife</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that has any correlation</p>
<p>in this guy but they did that with their</p>
<p>children this one little girl would sit</p>
<p>excitedly by the oven waiting for the</p>
<p>roasted brussels sprouts to be ready and</p>
<p>just joyously gobble them down so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>amazing it really is a learned addiction</p>
<p>to Sugar you know it appears because she</p>
<p>was really excited about that like they</p>
<p>were cookies so let&rsquo;s move along here</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>where did that go anyway Matthew uh</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see Carill excuse me from YouTube</p>
<p>what can be causing low iron and</p>
<p>ferritin levels and low tbic whatever</p>
<p>that is</p>
<p>well the most common reason in females</p>
<p>is menstruation</p>
<p>um but um it could also be diet you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re a vegan and you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>consuming enough of um the the</p>
<p>biovaluable iron foods which is animal</p>
<p>meats and liver</p>
<p>um so I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t have that data in</p>
<p>front of me but a really good supplement</p>
<p>to help you with these problems which</p>
<p>have to do with problems with iron and</p>
<p>also things that transport iron and</p>
<p>things that help saturate your</p>
<p>hemoglobin with iron</p>
<p>um would be like</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>liver pills so like supplements that are</p>
<p>grass-fed liver freeze-dried or even</p>
<p>spleen spleen um pills animals that come</p>
<p>from animals and it&rsquo;s uh it&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>way to help someone with anemia the</p>
<p>other reason</p>
<p>um they might be deficient in iron is</p>
<p>that they have some small intestinal</p>
<p>issues for example</p>
<p>um a small intestinal overgrowth or</p>
<p>maybe even a gastric bypass or they have</p>
<p>stomach acid issues they don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>enough acid because you need that acid</p>
<p>to absorb the iron these are all other</p>
<p>common reasons why you might be</p>
<p>deficient in Iron all right</p>
<p>very good well let&rsquo;s get back to our</p>
<p>quiz questions and the second question</p>
<p>of the day asked how can someone eat</p>
<p>whatever they want and still lose weight</p>
<p>and our audience</p>
<p>popped away from me for a second just a</p>
<p>moment</p>
<p>sorry the audience 65 of them</p>
<p>respondents say that it&rsquo;s possible with</p>
<p>a high metabolism and regular exercise</p>
<p>20 say it&rsquo;s possible with omad and</p>
<p>fasting and the remaining 15 say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>possible with an under active thyroid</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an interesting answer</p>
<p>okay so to make this really simple</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you have typically people will tell you</p>
<p>that diet and exercise is the way to</p>
<p>lose weight right</p>
<p>um and diet is responsible for like 85</p>
<p>percent of the results and then exercise</p>
<p>is responsible for 15 of the results but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another variable that&rsquo;s I think</p>
<p>even more more important</p>
<p>um and it has to do with</p>
<p>what happens to insulin because if you</p>
<p>can keep your insulin low you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to lose more weight and carbs from the</p>
<p>diet are one way but what about the</p>
<p>frequency of eating if you&rsquo;re eating a</p>
<p>lot of frequent meals and snacks guess</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re gonna you&rsquo;re just gonna be</p>
<p>bathed in so much insulin you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to lose weight so</p>
<p>I have known people that can eat</p>
<p>whatever they want and just do the one</p>
<p>meal a day and they can be successful at</p>
<p>weight loss and I think I&rsquo;m probably</p>
<p>talking to the person right now with</p>
<p>with Steve being on the other line but</p>
<p>um yeah but the point is that um those</p>
<p>people who do keto low carb and they cut</p>
<p>out the sugars</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t lose weight</p>
<p>um they have to do the add the one</p>
<p>additional thing which is the uh</p>
<p>the fasting because they have really bad</p>
<p>insulin resistance and I would even</p>
<p>venture to say the price 70 of the</p>
<p>population has that problem with insulin</p>
<p>resistance so they have to do a lot more</p>
<p>work those people that can just lower</p>
<p>some of the carbs the refined carbs and</p>
<p>lose weight</p>
<p>that represents a very smaller group of</p>
<p>people</p>
<p>um and they just you just cut the carbs</p>
<p>and Bam they just start losing weight</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t even have to new do</p>
<p>um this um intermittent fasting and all</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>anyway I wanted to bring it up because I</p>
<p>think um</p>
<p>um some people can get away with things</p>
<p>and other people can&rsquo;t it really comes</p>
<p>down to insulin resistance</p>
<p>um but if we compare just compare the</p>
<p>magnitude of changing your diet versus</p>
<p>changing the frequency of eating and</p>
<p>having less frequent meals</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s you&rsquo;ll lose way more weight if</p>
<p>you focus on that second option there</p>
<p>not that I&rsquo;m recommending it but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just telling you</p>
<p>that that intermittent fasting is hands</p>
<p>down the most important thing and that</p>
<p>relates to giving up all the snacking</p>
<p>that people just love to do it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>deadly on your</p>
<p>on your weight yeah well I will concur</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my magic intermittent fasting</p>
<p>allows me to be a little naughty in some</p>
<p>ways but I don&rsquo;t eat a three hour window</p>
<p>every day and what a joyous transition</p>
<p>from struggling my life that has been so</p>
<p>get on it audience and let&rsquo;s toss</p>
<p>another question Adam Doc and this is an</p>
<p>interesting one</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>being fatty</p>
<p>fatty help reduce plaquing in the</p>
<p>arteries</p>
<p>all right that seems counterintuitive as</p>
<p>so many things do</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m sure the audience will have an</p>
<p>answer and now let&rsquo;s go back to our</p>
<p>green room and I know you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>like Clayton a great deal because he is</p>
<p>from Wisconsin and Clayton if you will</p>
<p>unmute yourself you&rsquo;re on with Dr Burke</p>
<p>one question please 30 seconds</p>
<p>um thank you again for all the</p>
<p>information online I&rsquo;ve been really um</p>
<p>enjoying it it&rsquo;s covered it about two</p>
<p>weeks ago started the program of Keto</p>
<p>and intermittent intermittent fasting</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been helping a lot</p>
<p>um right but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so what I&rsquo;ve been struggling with is</p>
<p>gastritis and I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>no one has pointed it out I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really figure it out until watching your</p>
<p>videos</p>
<p>um on it and I&rsquo;m you know kind of going</p>
<p>through those things there I have a</p>
<p>history of you know all serve gerd IBS</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve kind of had it all</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>I guess I just wanted to ask</p>
<p>um you know should I you know I think</p>
<p>this is leading towards reacidifying my</p>
<p>gut which you have a great video on</p>
<p>um but until I get there I guess like</p>
<p>what advice do you have you know is it</p>
<p>eating smaller portions</p>
<p>um avoiding coffee avoiding spicy foods</p>
<p>avoiding medication I&rsquo;m curious how long</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll take to heal</p>
<p>um if I&rsquo;m doing the right nutritional</p>
<p>stuff that I&rsquo;m doing the keto and the</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and no stress and</p>
<p>then I guess I also wonder too well well</p>
<p>I always have an overly sensitive gut</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>issues there so any advice yeah</p>
<p>absolutely what part of Wisconsin are</p>
<p>you from</p>
<p>Eau Claire</p>
<p>okay okay good it&rsquo;s beautiful</p>
<p>um so um you&rsquo;re doing all the right</p>
<p>things it does take it could take</p>
<p>um several months</p>
<p>before you want to start introducing</p>
<p>betaine hydrochloride or apple cider</p>
<p>vinegar if you have gastritis because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s inflammation in that stomach so</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t want to stir anything up</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lining of mucus that protects</p>
<p>your cells</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>from this acid this really strong acid</p>
<p>um and so what&rsquo;s happening probably with</p>
<p>you is that that lining is kind of</p>
<p>breaking down to some degree and the one</p>
<p>of the biggest triggers</p>
<p>is stress</p>
<p>but what happens in a stressed state</p>
<p>that breaks it down is that it lowers</p>
<p>your immune system and it causes this H</p>
<p>pylori little guy to come out and start</p>
<p>to um</p>
<p>erode the um</p>
<p>the mucous membrane because there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>immune reaction</p>
<p>it has to do with stress</p>
<p>um the it&rsquo;s a couple good remedies I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if you caught this on my</p>
<p>videos would be zinc carnal sign that is</p>
<p>a a really good remedy for building up</p>
<p>that mucous layer back on your stomach</p>
<p>as well as sulforaphane</p>
<p>um from broccoli Sprouts or you can get</p>
<p>it from cabbage juice uh you juice</p>
<p>cabbage so you start doing that and now</p>
<p>it puts this H pylori microbe back in</p>
<p>remission because it&rsquo;s a sneaky little</p>
<p>critter because it it has this enzyme</p>
<p>uh urease that uh</p>
<p>um generates more</p>
<p>urea and generates more ammonia which is</p>
<p>very alkaline so now your Patriot</p>
<p>stomach gets worse and the body</p>
<p>compensates by producing more acid so it</p>
<p>gets all</p>
<p>messed up so you have to kind of um</p>
<p>do everything you can to handle the</p>
<p>stress that&rsquo;s the biggest Factor long</p>
<p>walks</p>
<p>get the rid of the source of the stress</p>
<p>take take those things I mentioned and</p>
<p>then intermittent fasting will be very</p>
<p>helpful too because every time you eat</p>
<p>you kind of like stirring it more acid</p>
<p>and it could be irritating that lining</p>
<p>but your goal should be to build up that</p>
<p>mucous layer that muconal mucosal layer</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s protecting</p>
<p>um the surface of your stomach</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other remedies out there too to</p>
<p>help with that but I think</p>
<p>those ones I just mentioned probably</p>
<p>enough</p>
<p>um so</p>
<p>that would be my advice</p>
<p>yeah I I just started doing all three</p>
<p>based on your videos</p>
<p>um so I&rsquo;m on the right track there</p>
<p>thoughts on like</p>
<p>smaller portions avoiding coffee</p>
<p>avoiding spicy food</p>
<p>yeah yeah because you got to keep um you</p>
<p>want to keep the system from having to</p>
<p>overwork too hard so every time you eat</p>
<p>it kind of like puts more stress in the</p>
<p>system and activates the system so like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why the fasting is really really</p>
<p>important and then coffee could be</p>
<p>acidic and spicy foods can be more</p>
<p>acidic to that can irritate it</p>
<p>um this is the</p>
<p>this is probably a case where</p>
<p>what I would recommend if it gets too</p>
<p>bad in certain situations is to take a</p>
<p>little bit of baking soda and water</p>
<p>um just to kind of give you some relief</p>
<p>at least that&rsquo;s different than an</p>
<p>antacid it&rsquo;s not going to be nearly as</p>
<p>bad and it&rsquo;s a bicarbonate and I mean</p>
<p>your pancreas makes it anyway naturally</p>
<p>so sodium bicarbonate</p>
<p>um might be beneficial for you and then</p>
<p>maybe</p>
<p>um the water that you drink I know in</p>
<p>Wisconsin there&rsquo;s a lot of great</p>
<p>um calcium rich water well water spring</p>
<p>water or even some of the bottled water</p>
<p>that is very high in the bicarbonates</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s even alkaline water</p>
<p>naturally alkaline alkalinized so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not like from a machine</p>
<p>all right well Clayton listen thanks so</p>
<p>thanks so much and I know Dr Berg always</p>
<p>is a little partial to those from</p>
<p>Wisconsin and so you&rsquo;re part of the club</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for sure of course yeah and good</p>
<p>luck with that and please as we asked I</p>
<p>had I</p>
<p>I had that exact same thing developed an</p>
<p>ulcer and I know what that feels like it</p>
<p>was miserable but uh yeah you can get</p>
<p>better fully and then look back on this</p>
<p>and like wow remember when I had that</p>
<p>bad gastritis</p>
<p>that was a it&rsquo;s all gone now so yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great thanks Clayton so much okay</p>
<p>so the audience dug in immediately to</p>
<p>question number three the</p>
<p>counter-intuitive one that says how can</p>
<p>eating fatty cheese help reducing plaque</p>
<p>in the arteries and uh 82 percent of the</p>
<p>respondents say it&rsquo;s because of the K2</p>
<p>and vitamin D and cheese ten percent say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the protein and calcium and the</p>
<p>final eight percent say it&rsquo;s the Cassian</p>
<p>did I say that right now</p>
<p>casein potassium no it&rsquo;s with a c</p>
<p>calcium</p>
<p>casein excuse me okay</p>
<p>all right</p>
<p>um anyway so here&rsquo;s the answer uh the</p>
<p>answer is vitamin K2</p>
<p>uh vitamin K2 um keeps the calcium out</p>
<p>of the arteries it drives the calcium</p>
<p>into the bone and um if you have a part</p>
<p>of plaquing as calcium so there&rsquo;s even a</p>
<p>test called the CAC test the coronary</p>
<p>artery calcification test which is a</p>
<p>great predictor mortality</p>
<p>um you want it zero so it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>important to keep calcium on the</p>
<p>arteries and it gets it starts occurring</p>
<p>when you have inflammation</p>
<p>so um just so happens that vitamin K2 is</p>
<p>in these fatty foods especially</p>
<p>fermented fatty foods as in the um very</p>
<p>fatty cheese in the um so if you can um</p>
<p>brie cheese would be a good source</p>
<p>um but there&rsquo;s other types of cheeses</p>
<p>well like monster cheese and</p>
<p>some of the other</p>
<p>hard cheeses</p>
<p>um which might not be as fatty but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of different good cheeses</p>
<p>especially in Europe that are loaded</p>
<p>with vitamin K2</p>
<p>this goes completely against what they</p>
<p>say to do you know oh you have to avoid</p>
<p>you know these fatty foods to clean out</p>
<p>your arteries have your whole grains and</p>
<p>limit the sugars</p>
<p>um so</p>
<p>again it&rsquo;s uh like I always said you</p>
<p>know find out what they are telling you</p>
<p>to do and maybe look in the exact</p>
<p>opposite direction because</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;ll probably be more successful</p>
<p>all right very good why don&rsquo;t we clean</p>
<p>out the Green Room by bringing on a</p>
<p>Christie from Colton California and</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s near the beautiful San Bernardino</p>
<p>Mountains I think that I used to go up</p>
<p>and have fun in so uh Christy one</p>
<p>question in 30 seconds as we get close</p>
<p>to the top of the hour</p>
<p>I will certainly try to keep it um short</p>
<p>so I am looking for a natural way of</p>
<p>treating various</p>
<p>various conditions</p>
<p>um that I have and I&rsquo;m taking a lot of</p>
<p>medications in order to control those</p>
<p>conditions blood pressure high</p>
<p>cholesterol and sugar my</p>
<p>my my blood pressure and my sugar</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>were horribly horribly uh High</p>
<p>um but I&rsquo;m having</p>
<p>contraindications between those</p>
<p>medications and then</p>
<p>um side effects now that I see</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>I got it okay good so um here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I would recommend um it sounds to</p>
<p>me like a classic metabolic syndrome</p>
<p>where you have the blood pressure and</p>
<p>the cholesterol and</p>
<p>um so what I would recommend is uh watch</p>
<p>my videos on insulin we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>reducing insulin get on my basic eating</p>
<p>plan because that way you could reduce</p>
<p>the insulin part of this puzzle and</p>
<p>these things will probably be improved</p>
<p>the other great remedies if you want a</p>
<p>remedy</p>
<p>a natural remedy would be berberine</p>
<p>berberine is a probably one of the best</p>
<p>natural things that to mimic metformin</p>
<p>for insulin resistance so it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>natural version of Metformin without the</p>
<p>side effects</p>
<p>um with the blood pressure</p>
<p>um you know</p>
<p>it should improve when you start cutting</p>
<p>out sugars and taking berberine but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two other things that are</p>
<p>involved with blood pressure you have um</p>
<p>um vitamin D and then you have also</p>
<p>potassium so I think those two would be</p>
<p>really really key as well but</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve started keto yet</p>
<p>but I would get on keto immediately and</p>
<p>then it may be probably the most</p>
<p>important thing you&rsquo;ve ever done</p>
<p>especially for your arteries and what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re dealing with but I do understand</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>these medications I mean it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bizarre to me that</p>
<p>um the emphasis is like oh yeah let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s control your cholesterol let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>control your blood pressure but okay</p>
<p>what are we going to do to eliminate the</p>
<p>problem what can we do to fix the cause</p>
<p>of the problem that is not addressed at</p>
<p>all it&rsquo;s like well we don&rsquo;t know yet but</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just keep your blood sugars low</p>
<p>and uh like okay well what about the</p>
<p>diet</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s not important right now</p>
<p>so yeah wow</p>
<p>well Christy listen thank you so much</p>
<p>and we sure would appreciate hearing</p>
<p>backwards did you have one more quick</p>
<p>question it seems as though you had</p>
<p>something to say I I do uh I know a lot</p>
<p>of my blood pressure has to do with the</p>
<p>stress at work</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>very toxic environment very very toxic</p>
<p>and I was off actually for a number of</p>
<p>months for another medical condition and</p>
<p>all of my levels my sugar my VP</p>
<p>everything was like completely normal uh</p>
<p>it I went back and everything went up</p>
<p>high uh skyrocketed so I know that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something that I need to do in</p>
<p>terms of the my diet I really try to be</p>
<p>careful and do many of the things I</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t started the keto which I will</p>
<p>look at seriously but</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s I know that a lot of it is</p>
<p>stress related</p>
<p>okay so um this is very brings up the</p>
<p>omitted information that I needed</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>stress activates adrenaline cortisol</p>
<p>both adrenaline and cortisol mobilize</p>
<p>glucose from your body your body starts</p>
<p>making glucose for quick energy now</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to happen next is a lot of</p>
<p>other problems like um</p>
<p>hypoxia</p>
<p>which is basically a lack of oxygen in</p>
<p>your heart muscle itself this is why the</p>
<p>stress heart connection with heart</p>
<p>attacks is so high you basically starve</p>
<p>off the tissues and you create fibrosis</p>
<p>and necrosis and so yes stress is</p>
<p>equivalent to eating sugar uh you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you need to get on keto even more the</p>
<p>more stress you have to eliminate every</p>
<p>bit of it but I would um</p>
<p>find another job for sure in the</p>
<p>meantime I would counter the stress by</p>
<p>doing a lot of exercise and physical</p>
<p>work around the house</p>
<p>to mentally kind of extract yourself but</p>
<p>yeah this this I mean think about stress</p>
<p>um paralyzes your immune system and</p>
<p>causes that H pylori which creates</p>
<p>gastritis and ulcers stress uh</p>
<p>can produce high cholesterol uh issues</p>
<p>stress destroys the heart</p>
<p>and stress also destroys the</p>
<p>mitochondria</p>
<p>which leads to all sorts of other issues</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m going to release an another video</p>
<p>this next week which I think is very</p>
<p>interesting relating to what stress does</p>
<p>to your microbe your microbes in your</p>
<p>gut this will blow you away it causes</p>
<p>one of the things it does is cause your</p>
<p>microbes to go into a biofilm</p>
<p>um shift from</p>
<p>friendly to pathogenic bacteria so to</p>
<p>your entire digestive system and the</p>
<p>micros itself I mean it&rsquo;s just amazing</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just glad the majority of the</p>
<p>population is not going through stress</p>
<p>now and that&rsquo;s just a great thing right</p>
<p>now and I&rsquo;m being very sarcastic but um</p>
<p>yeah so I have a lot of videos and</p>
<p>stress</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and then isolating you already know</p>
<p>where your stress is coming from but uh</p>
<p>do what you can to keep it down as low</p>
<p>as possible all right well thank you</p>
<p>Christy so much we appreciate that and</p>
<p>the audience knows that I&rsquo;m under</p>
<p>tremendous stress with the Dr Berg</p>
<p>constantly chastising me and putting me</p>
<p>under great pressure you can tell that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the sort of fella he is but that&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that deserve stress Steve that&rsquo;s beside</p>
<p>the point for goodness sakes everyone</p>
<p>can make a mistake all right all right</p>
<p>so anyway here we go with the fourth</p>
<p>question an audience I need your help</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re a little behind but I want</p>
<p>to make sure that we get to all this one</p>
<p>and then one out of one so doc read that</p>
<p>out to them please what is the best food</p>
<p>for your eyes</p>
<p>hmm right what&rsquo;s the best food for the</p>
<p>eyes audience and let&rsquo;s see Adriana from</p>
<p>uh Facebook I have an overgrowth of</p>
<p>yeast in my GI tract what can I do to</p>
<p>fix it</p>
<p>that is um you&rsquo;re lacking the bacteria</p>
<p>to keep the the candida in check and so</p>
<p>um usually that comes from either one</p>
<p>after taking an antibiotic or things</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>mimic antibiotics like</p>
<p>um drinking um chlorine water you know</p>
<p>from your tap water will do it um a lot</p>
<p>of diet sodas will do it eating</p>
<p>sterilized food will do it eating animal</p>
<p>products that have been had antibiotics</p>
<p>will do it</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>even GMO foods that are loaded with</p>
<p>glyphosate which is a antibiotic can</p>
<p>actually influence that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but the other Factor if you want to get</p>
<p>rid of candida is realize this one thing</p>
<p>that candida is a type of yeast that can</p>
<p>only live on sugar</p>
<p>so if you eliminate the sugar out of</p>
<p>your diet you will literally starve off</p>
<p>this candida and they have nothing to</p>
<p>live on and they will go bye-bye really</p>
<p>quick so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>on one hand they cause the increase</p>
<p>craving for sweets sometimes like ice</p>
<p>cream things like that on the flip side</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t give in and you restrict</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll eliminate your Candida all right</p>
<p>very good WK from YouTube does citrus</p>
<p>bergmot uh lower cholesterol</p>
<p>yes yes it does well that&rsquo;s a quick</p>
<p>there you go WK</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;re wondering is over JD from</p>
<p>excuse me JD the welder from YouTube I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>freaking out I&rsquo;m a 54 year old male my</p>
<p>triglycerides have doubled to 360. I</p>
<p>guess that is I recently uh what should</p>
<p>I be doing to immediately bring down the</p>
<p>levels of course doesn&rsquo;t discuss his</p>
<p>diet or anything</p>
<p>well the first thing that is that we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>raise those is your carbs are too high</p>
<p>or eating desserts but let&rsquo;s say for</p>
<p>example you tell me oh no I went on keto</p>
<p>and my triglycerides went up</p>
<p>um realize you&rsquo;re mobilizing the fat</p>
<p>okay and that can come out fat cells are</p>
<p>loaded with triglycerides as well as</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>cholesterol</p>
<p>um cholesterol triglycerides are used</p>
<p>for energy too so if you are on the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet and you&rsquo;re also eating a</p>
<p>lot of fat okay and you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>exercising you&rsquo;re triglycerides probably</p>
<p>will go up because you&rsquo;re not burning</p>
<p>them off so just maybe cut down some of</p>
<p>the fat and start exercising but</p>
<p>exercise in general keeping your carbs</p>
<p>low will keep these triglycerides in</p>
<p>check unless you are experiencing a lot</p>
<p>of stress like I just said the the</p>
<p>stress can really throw off all the</p>
<p>lipids and it&rsquo;s a big factor it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably just as bad as eating sugar</p>
<p>all right very good</p>
<p>Runa from YouTube what are your</p>
<p>recommendations for treating fibroids</p>
<p>fibroids are a growth it&rsquo;s like a benign</p>
<p>tumor that&rsquo;s growing and you&rsquo;d want to</p>
<p>do things that are not so anabolic which</p>
<p>means it&rsquo;s like building things up like</p>
<p>if you were to consume milk for example</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very Ana box so it&rsquo;ll stimulate</p>
<p>growth of certain things so um what you</p>
<p>have to do is eliminate the dairy</p>
<p>products number one and number two start</p>
<p>doing intermittent fasting and number</p>
<p>three uh there&rsquo;s something else that can</p>
<p>you can start consuming to help lower</p>
<p>the other anabolic</p>
<p>hormone which is estrogen and that would</p>
<p>be</p>
<p>um cruciferous vegetables and another</p>
<p>concentrated cruciferous vegetable</p>
<p>called dim that&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s like an</p>
<p>anti-astrogenic</p>
<p>supplement that you can take that works</p>
<p>really good on that condition wonderful</p>
<p>okay here we go what is the best food</p>
<p>for your eyes the audience did help me</p>
<p>out with a rapid response 75 percent of</p>
<p>our respondents say it&rsquo;s fatty fish 15</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s carrots five percent say eggs</p>
<p>which you and I love doc five percent</p>
<p>say blueberries or beef liver</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>everyone is correct on this</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I was going to say egg yolk but probably</p>
<p>eggyo combined with uh salmon or fish</p>
<p>because you have the DHA which is part</p>
<p>of that retina like certain part of the</p>
<p>retina the macula is like 50</p>
<p>um DHA but on the flip side</p>
<p>um you have DHA also in egg yolks too</p>
<p>um and you also have an in the egg yolk</p>
<p>you have something else you have um two</p>
<p>carotenoids one is lutein the other one</p>
<p>is zeaxanthin which are specific</p>
<p>pigments naturally in your eyeball</p>
<p>that have to come from the diet</p>
<p>that I act like natural sunscreen and</p>
<p>they protect the UV radiation so this is</p>
<p>why if you&rsquo;re not eating healthily in</p>
<p>your diet</p>
<p>then what happens is you lose those and</p>
<p>you start you could potentially get</p>
<p>age-related macular degeneration</p>
<p>so um the point is that I think egg</p>
<p>yolks and fish should be at the top of</p>
<p>the list but egg yolks have both</p>
<p>um things that you need so</p>
<p>so eggs are one of the best things for</p>
<p>the eye that&rsquo;s terrific let&rsquo;s see if we</p>
<p>can do this last question doc</p>
<p>okay how can stress cause</p>
<p>ulcers so this is a question</p>
<p>that I probably already just told you</p>
<p>but I want to see if you guys were</p>
<p>listening all right this is the uh this</p>
<p>spot quiz to see how many people love Dr</p>
<p>bird and take his counsel seriously all</p>
<p>right let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um we already talked about the bergmot</p>
<p>we talked about that</p>
<p>um oh Cheryl from Facebook which</p>
<p>vitamins do you recommend to improve</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s circulation</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know if we&rsquo;re talking excuse me</p>
<p>about the heart</p>
<p>um I would say the tocatrinals the</p>
<p>vitamin E</p>
<p>um but in the in the form of tocotrenals</p>
<p>which by the way has a tendency to thin</p>
<p>the blood if there&rsquo;s a kind of like a</p>
<p>thicker clotting going on but not to the</p>
<p>point where it&rsquo;s dangerous but just to a</p>
<p>normal level</p>
<p>um garlic also is another thing for</p>
<p>great circulation</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so vitamin C is good for the entire</p>
<p>inner lining of your vascular system</p>
<p>um so those are some really key things</p>
<p>for circulation that I would recommend</p>
<p>but it would be helpful if you can tell</p>
<p>me what specific um</p>
<p>problems you&rsquo;re having because if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to tell me you have</p>
<p>gangrene because you&rsquo;re diabetic then</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to shift my answer to uh B1</p>
<p>benphotamine</p>
<p>because you need to be those B vitamins</p>
<p>to counter the sugar toxicity to your</p>
<p>circulation so on one hand yeah you want</p>
<p>to take the nutrition for your</p>
<p>circulation but on the other hand you</p>
<p>want to fix what&rsquo;s causing the problem</p>
<p>the first place which is just high</p>
<p>levels of sugar which destroy the tiny</p>
<p>little micro vascular vascular</p>
<p>capillars that are just being destroyed</p>
<p>right now from the high sugar</p>
<p>right all right and here&rsquo;s a terribly</p>
<p>prevalent problem Deborah from Facebook</p>
<p>uh what are the best practices to treat</p>
<p>rheumatoid arthritis and by the way doc</p>
<p>after that we have an answer for the</p>
<p>final question</p>
<p>I think rheumatoid arthritis there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>several things that are related to this</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re actually just talking about</p>
<p>um one is there&rsquo;s higher levels of</p>
<p>adrenaline involved with</p>
<p>um with rheumatoid arthritis which</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a connection with that hypoxia</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve talked about in the heart</p>
<p>so um there&rsquo;s a stress factor related to</p>
<p>this also there&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>um higher levels of lactic acid too that</p>
<p>are are</p>
<p>present in people with rheumatoid</p>
<p>arthritis which tells me that the</p>
<p>pathway that they&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>is more the glycolysis pathway which</p>
<p>means that they&rsquo;re eating more sugar</p>
<p>than they should so if anyone&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>rheumatoid arthritis the most important</p>
<p>thing to do is to</p>
<p>get off the sugars and refined carbs do</p>
<p>keto that&rsquo;ll probably give them</p>
<p>tremendous relief cut down the stress</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the adrenaline part and</p>
<p>then the last thing is the potassium</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also low potassium and um in</p>
<p>rheumatoid cases as well as low vitamin</p>
<p>D</p>
<p>so I would start to beef up that</p>
<p>potassium and vitamin D I think that&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>put someone in really good shape but um</p>
<p>yeah so many people have rheumatoid</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re taking medications but they</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t changed the diet they don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>these basic key nutrients have a huge</p>
<p>influence on their joints so</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what I would recommend</p>
<p>all right very good will our producer</p>
<p>Terry is a terrible grammarian and he</p>
<p>hates it when I butcher his question</p>
<p>that that was not Deborah it was Deidra</p>
<p>as he pointed out to me with an</p>
<p>exclamation mark So Deidra sorry for</p>
<p>stepping on your name like that and uh</p>
<p>sorry for that but I&rsquo;m very grateful for</p>
<p>the audience leaping through these</p>
<p>questions when I was running late so the</p>
<p>final question today is how can stress</p>
<p>cause</p>
<p>ulcers and 90 say it&rsquo;s due to elevated</p>
<p>cortisol levels uh it sounds like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re listening and 10 say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because of increased levels of stomach</p>
<p>acid</p>
<p>so what happens</p>
<p>um is when you go through stress there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a kind of a paralysis of your immune</p>
<p>system so now the thing that&rsquo;s supposed</p>
<p>to be regulating that H pylori is no</p>
<p>longer regulating the H pylori so it</p>
<p>gets out of control it creates an immune</p>
<p>reaction that starts to destroy that</p>
<p>mucosal layer that then leads to an</p>
<p>ulcer</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s the that&rsquo;s the mechanism</p>
<p>um and it&rsquo;s uh it&rsquo;s a big problem for a</p>
<p>lot of people that are going through</p>
<p>stress and they have ulcers but on that</p>
<p>note I really appreciate everyone that</p>
<p>was stuck around this long that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>watching the next two weeks we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to be doing a show we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>take a little break and then we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to come back on the third week so stay</p>
<p>tuned for that but we will be releasing</p>
<p>quite a few videos coming up so thank</p>
<p>you so much for your attention and have</p>
<p>a wonderful next two weeks</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>thank you</p>
