    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>This podcast is separate from my teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now</p>
<p>showing that vitamin D3 is essential</p>
<p>for various aspects of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s element.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a new month, which means it&rsquo;s a new topic</p>
<p>here at the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>For the next four or so episodes,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to be talking all about hormone effects</p>
<p>on the brain and body.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a huge number of different topics.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about sex.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about reproduction.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about puberty a little bit more.</p>
<p>We talked about that in the previous episode.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about menopause.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about birth control,</p>
<p>where you are going to talk about aggression,</p>
<p>competition, winning, losing.</p>
<p>Basically, we&rsquo;re going to cover as much about hormones</p>
<p>as we possibly can in this month.</p>
<p>And in doing so,</p>
<p>we are going to go deep into tools and protocols.</p>
<p>We are also going to talk about a lot of tools</p>
<p>that relate to things that you might not want to do</p>
<p>in order to optimize hormone health,</p>
<p>regardless of stage of life or your goals, et cetera.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sure to be a month rich with discussion,</p>
<p>rich with tools,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to learn a lot of neuroscience</p>
<p>and endocrinology.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a field of neuroendocrinology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually where I started my graduate work.</p>
<p>I did a master&rsquo;s in it,</p>
<p>which is only to say that I love the topic.</p>
<p>I have a lot of friends that work on this topic,</p>
<p>many of whom I&rsquo;ve consulted for these episodes,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m really excited to share the information with you.</p>
<p>Before we dive into today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>all about emotions and sex,</p>
<p>I want to just have a few announcements</p>
<p>that are designed to point you to some useful resources.</p>
<p>Last episode,</p>
<p>talking about the science of emotions and relationships,</p>
<p>I mentioned the Mood Meter app.</p>
<p>The Mood Meter app was developed</p>
<p>by people out at Yale University</p>
<p>who study the biology and psychology of emotions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really wonderful app.</p>
<p>However, many of you quickly told me</p>
<p>that the Mood Meter app isn&rsquo;t available in your area.</p>
<p>You went to the link we posted,</p>
<p>and it just was saying not available in your area.</p>
<p>The situation was actually a lot worse than that.</p>
<p>The situation was that when we recorded the episode,</p>
<p>the Mood Meter app was working, I know,</p>
<p>because I downloaded a fresh copy of it to my phone,</p>
<p>and then in the ensuing weekend,</p>
<p>they took the Mood Meter app down for some repairs.</p>
<p>The Mood Meter app is now up.</p>
<p>It is available.</p>
<p>I want to be really clear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an app I&rsquo;m affiliated with.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just mentioning it to you.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know me.</p>
<p>I know them, but they don&rsquo;t know me.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t have any kind of business relationship.</p>
<p>They do charge 99 cents for the app.</p>
<p>I think the free version has disappeared</p>
<p>in the last year or so.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s Mood Meter app.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll provide the link again,</p>
<p>and the link should be working.</p>
<p>Hopefully they won&rsquo;t take it down again</p>
<p>in between this announcement</p>
<p>and the release of this episode.</p>
<p>Also just want to take a step back for a moment</p>
<p>and talk a little bit about the logic</p>
<p>of how to make the most of the information</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>I tend to throw out a lot of information</p>
<p>about a given topic.</p>
<p>Many of you have pointed out, however,</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t cover certain things.</p>
<p>And once again, I&rsquo;ll just say,</p>
<p>the goal is always to be accurate,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no way I can be exhaustive.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way I can cover everything</p>
<p>for a particular topic.</p>
<p>The good news is we have time.</p>
<p>My goal, at least in the first year</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>is to give you a basis, a foundation</p>
<p>in these different topics of neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>focus, sleep, hormones, et cetera.</p>
<p>And of course, to provide tools along the way.</p>
<p>We are going to host guests.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually started recording</p>
<p>with some of these guests already.</p>
<p>And even those episodes will include</p>
<p>a little what we call primer,</p>
<p>a little description of the basics of a given topic</p>
<p>so that you can get more information from those topics.</p>
<p>My goal really is to educate you in these topics,</p>
<p>give you a foundation in these topics,</p>
<p>and allow you to start exploring them here</p>
<p>in the episodes with our future guests,</p>
<p>but also in other podcasts and books</p>
<p>and other sources of information.</p>
<p>So for those of you that are saying</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too much information,</p>
<p>I just encourage you to remind yourself</p>
<p>that you have a pause button.</p>
<p>You can return to it.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s timestamped.</p>
<p>For those of you who feel it&rsquo;s not enough information,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not covering enough,</p>
<p>just know that this is just the beginning.</p>
<p>We intend to do this for a very long time</p>
<p>and we will be thorough over time.</p>
<p>So thanks for your patience</p>
<p>and please be patient with yourselves.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason why you have to digest</p>
<p>all the information in one swoop.</p>
<p>The other thing is that I&rsquo;ve been told</p>
<p>both that I speak too fast and speak too slow.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a wonderful solution to this.</p>
<p>If I speak too fast or too slow,</p>
<p>you can adjust the speed in YouTube.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re listening in a different format,</p>
<p>I think you also can adjust the speed of playback.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s something that wouldn&rsquo;t be possible</p>
<p>in the classroom, but you may find useful.</p>
<p>And then last but not least,</p>
<p>I want to point people again to this NSDR,</p>
<p>non-sleep deep rest protocol</p>
<p>that the folks over at Made For</p>
<p>have put out as a free resource.</p>
<p>It does, as many of you pointed out,</p>
<p>bear resemblance to things like yoga nidra,</p>
<p>other forms of meditation.</p>
<p>But what we&rsquo;ve done is we&rsquo;ve stripped out intentions</p>
<p>or any kind of the verbiage related</p>
<p>to what some people might perceive</p>
<p>as kind of related to the yoga community</p>
<p>or specific to kind of new agey type techniques,</p>
<p>not because we don&rsquo;t like yoga nidra.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;ve done yoga nidra daily</p>
<p>for almost the last, goodness, eight years of my life.</p>
<p>I love yoga nidra,</p>
<p>but sometimes the complicated language can be a separator</p>
<p>and can discourage people from taking on these protocols</p>
<p>that are extremely useful.</p>
<p>So NSDR is intentionally generic,</p>
<p>is designed to bring you into a state of deep relaxation</p>
<p>through a combination of breathing and body scan.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the YouTube script over at Made For,</p>
<p>which is linked in the caption.</p>
<p>And many people find that they prefer that</p>
<p>to scripts like yoga nidra scripts,</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re doing intentions</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re hearing a lot of kind of unusual language</p>
<p>around the process.</p>
<p>This is just very basic and I hope you&rsquo;ll enjoy it.</p>
<p>And if you prefer the more typical yoga nidra scripts,</p>
<p>then go with those.</p>
<p>There are many of them available</p>
<p>on the internet and elsewhere.</p>
<p>And last but not least,</p>
<p>I want to point out that all our episodes now</p>
<p>are subtitled both in English and in Spanish.</p>
<p>So for those of you that prefer</p>
<p>to digest this information in Spanish,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s now available to you in the subtitles.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to talk about the science of sex,</p>
<p>in particular, sexual differentiation.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s a complicated topic</p>
<p>because sex is both a adjective, a noun, and a verb,</p>
<p>depending on the context.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to talk about the hormonal effects</p>
<p>and the neural effects of particular events</p>
<p>that happen during development</p>
<p>and how those guide adolescent and adult behavior,</p>
<p>including sexual preference.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an area that&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>and for which there are actually</p>
<p>very solid textbook findings.</p>
<p>So textbook findings means that there are many studies</p>
<p>that have been aggregated over decades</p>
<p>that point to what we now know to be absolute truths</p>
<p>in terms of how hormones affect brain development,</p>
<p>how the brain impacts hormonal development</p>
<p>and how those interact to control behavior, for instance.</p>
<p>We are also going to talk about reproduction, the verb sex.</p>
<p>And of course, sex, the verb,</p>
<p>can also be carried out independent of reproduction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always, in particular in humans,</p>
<p>just to produce offspring.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to be covered in the next episode,</p>
<p>but you absolutely need to understand</p>
<p>the information in this episode</p>
<p>in order to make sense of the information</p>
<p>in the next episode.</p>
<p>So today we&rsquo;re going to explore hormones,</p>
<p>what they are, how they work,</p>
<p>what leads to masculinization or feminization</p>
<p>of the brain and body.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just throw out one really interesting fact</p>
<p>that perhaps most of you didn&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>that hormones have direct effects on the body.</p>
<p>Most people know that because there are hormone differences</p>
<p>and sex differences in bodies</p>
<p>in terms of genitalia and body hair,</p>
<p>distribution of body hair, et cetera.</p>
<p>But there are also effects of hormones on the brain directly</p>
<p>and believe it or not,</p>
<p>there are also effects on the spinal cord,</p>
<p>on the neurons and structures within the spinal cord</p>
<p>that impact in a very direct way</p>
<p>what sorts of behaviors are possible.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a fascinating area.</p>
<p>You might notice I&rsquo;m going to go a little bit more slowly</p>
<p>through this topic than I normally do.</p>
<p>I want to be extremely careful with my language.</p>
<p>Some of these topics,</p>
<p>some of you may be thinking are extremely sensitive, right?</p>
<p>And of course, any discussion about sex and reproduction</p>
<p>is a sensitive one,</p>
<p>but today we&rsquo;re just talking about the biology.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not getting into the cultural constraints</p>
<p>or the cultural dialogue.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re trying to do today is really get to the biology,</p>
<p>the physiology, the endocrinology and the behavior.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start by talking about what hormones are,</p>
<p>just to remind you, and what they do.</p>
<p>Hormones by definition are a substance,</p>
<p>a chemical that&rsquo;s released in one area of the body,</p>
<p>typically from something we call a gland,</p>
<p>although they can also be released from neurons,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re released often from glands</p>
<p>that travel and have effects both on that gland,</p>
<p>but also on other organs and tissues in the body.</p>
<p>And that differentiates hormones</p>
<p>from things like neurotransmitters,</p>
<p>which tend to act more locally.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>A hormone is a substance secreted</p>
<p>at one location in the body,</p>
<p>travels and has impact on things elsewhere in the body.</p>
<p>Examples of tissues that produce hormones</p>
<p>would be the thyroid, the testes, the ovaries, et cetera.</p>
<p>And then of course, there are areas of the brain</p>
<p>like the hypothalamus and the pituitary,</p>
<p>which are closely related to one another</p>
<p>and release hormones that cause the release</p>
<p>of yet other hormones out in the body.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to cover all this.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know anything about endocrinology,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still going to be able</p>
<p>to understand today&rsquo;s discussion.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to start with a discussion</p>
<p>about what hormones actually do</p>
<p>to create this thing that we call masculinization</p>
<p>or feminization.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start with development.</p>
<p>Sperm meets egg.</p>
<p>Everything that happens before that</p>
<p>is a topic of the next episode,</p>
<p>but sperm meets egg.</p>
<p>This is mammalian reproduction.</p>
<p>And that egg starts to duplicate.</p>
<p>It starts to make more of itself.</p>
<p>It makes more cells.</p>
<p>And eventually some of those cells become skin.</p>
<p>Some of those cells become brain.</p>
<p>Some of those cells become muscle.</p>
<p>Some of those cells become fingers.</p>
<p>All the stuff that makes up the brain and body plan.</p>
<p>In addition, there are hormones</p>
<p>that come both from the mother</p>
<p>and from the developing baby, the developing fetus</p>
<p>that impact whether or not the brain will be</p>
<p>what they call organized masculine or organized feminine.</p>
<p>And as I say this,</p>
<p>I want you to try and discard with the cultural connotations</p>
<p>or your psychological connotations</p>
<p>of what masculinization and feminization are</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re only centering on the biology.</p>
<p>So typically people have either two X chromosomes</p>
<p>and the traditional language around that</p>
<p>is that person is female, right?</p>
<p>Or an X chromosome and a Y chromosome.</p>
<p>And that person will become male.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s not always the case.</p>
<p>There are cases where it&rsquo;s XXY,</p>
<p>where there are two X chromosomes plus a Y chromosome.</p>
<p>There are also cases where it&rsquo;s XYY,</p>
<p>where there are two Y chromosomes.</p>
<p>And these have important biological</p>
<p>and psychological impacts.</p>
<p>So the first thing we need to establish</p>
<p>is that there is something called chromosomal sex.</p>
<p>Whether or not they&rsquo;re two X chromosomes</p>
<p>or an X and Y chromosome is what we call chromosomal sex.</p>
<p>But the next stage of separating out the sexes</p>
<p>is what we call gonadal sex.</p>
<p>Typically, not always, but typically,</p>
<p>if somebody has testes for their gonads,</p>
<p>we think of them as male.</p>
<p>And if somebody has ovaries, we think of them as female.</p>
<p>Although that&rsquo;s not always the case either.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s just explore the transition</p>
<p>from chromosomal sex to gonadal sex</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a fascinating one</p>
<p>that we all went through in some form or another.</p>
<p>So this XY that we typically think of</p>
<p>as promoting masculinization of the fetus.</p>
<p>We say that because on the Y chromosome, there are genes</p>
<p>and those genes have particular functions</p>
<p>that suppress female reproductive organs.</p>
<p>So on the Y chromosome, there&rsquo;s a gene</p>
<p>which encodes for something called</p>
<p>the Mullerian inhibiting hormone.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s actually a hormone that&rsquo;s programmed</p>
<p>by the Y chromosome that inhibits the formation</p>
<p>of Mullerian ducts, which are an important part</p>
<p>of the female reproductive apparatus.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s critical because already we&rsquo;re seeing the transition</p>
<p>between chromosome, Y chromosome and gonad.</p>
<p>And other genes on the Y chromosome</p>
<p>promote the formation of testes.</p>
<p>So there are genes like the SRY gene</p>
<p>and other genes that promote the formation of testes</p>
<p>while they also inhibit the formation of the Mullerian ducts.</p>
<p>So the transition from chromosomal sex</p>
<p>to gonadal sex is a very important distinction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a fork in the road</p>
<p>that happens very early in development</p>
<p>while fetuses are still in the embryo.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s interesting as well is that just</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a Y chromosome</p>
<p>that can suppress Mullerian duct formation</p>
<p>and there are other genes on the Y chromosome</p>
<p>that promote teste development,</p>
<p>the placenta itself is an endocrine organ.</p>
<p>I think most people don&rsquo;t know this,</p>
<p>but the placenta is an endocrine organ.</p>
<p>As well, the mother, which of course is carrying the fetus,</p>
<p>has an adrenal gland, which can produce testosterone.</p>
<p>There are instances, for example,</p>
<p>where a mother has either a tumor</p>
<p>or for some other reason is secreting large levels</p>
<p>of testosterone while carrying a fetus that is XX.</p>
<p>And that leads to what we would call masculinization</p>
<p>of certain aspects of the fetus.</p>
<p>Typically, that would be enlarged clitoris.</p>
<p>There are also some examples of other phenotypes</p>
<p>on the body that are created,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s a purely XX chromosomal baby.</p>
<p>So we have to distinguish</p>
<p>between chromosomal sex, gonadal sex,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s what we call hormonal sex,</p>
<p>which is the effects of the steroid hormones,</p>
<p>estrogen and testosterone and their derivatives,</p>
<p>on what we call morphological sex,</p>
<p>or the shape of the baby and the human and the genitalia</p>
<p>and the jaw and all these other things.</p>
<p>And so it actually is quite complicated.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s a long distance</p>
<p>from chromosomes to gender identity,</p>
<p>and gender identity has a lot of social influences</p>
<p>and roles.</p>
<p>This is an area that right now is very dynamic</p>
<p>and in the discussion out there, as you know.</p>
<p>But just getting from chromosomal sex</p>
<p>to what we would call gonadal sex and hormonal sex</p>
<p>and morphological sex involves a number of steps.</p>
<p>So today we&rsquo;re going to talk about those steps.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some fascinating things</p>
<p>that do indeed relate to tools,</p>
<p>do indeed relate to some important behavioral choices,</p>
<p>important choices about things to avoid while pregnant.</p>
<p>And for those of you that are not pregnant,</p>
<p>things to avoid if you&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>about eventually having children.</p>
<p>And that is not to drive development</p>
<p>in one direction or another,</p>
<p>but there are examples where there are some</p>
<p>deleterious things in our environment</p>
<p>that can actually negatively impact</p>
<p>what we call sexual development overall,</p>
<p>regardless of chromosomal background.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s get started with that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk a little bit more about what hormones do.</p>
<p>Hormones generally have two categories of effects.</p>
<p>They can either be very fast or they can be very slow.</p>
<p>There are hormones like cortisol and adrenaline,</p>
<p>which act very fast.</p>
<p>Adrenaline can increase your heart rate very fast</p>
<p>when secreted into the body.</p>
<p>Cortisol can be a little bit slower,</p>
<p>but it also can have some very fast effects.</p>
<p>And then there are hormones like testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>which we refer to as the sex steroid hormones.</p>
<p>The sex steroid hormones can have quick effects</p>
<p>through signaling, meaning they can attach to cells</p>
<p>and make those cells do different things.</p>
<p>They can have actually quite quick effects on the brain.</p>
<p>A lot of people don&rsquo;t know this,</p>
<p>but there are some very fast effects</p>
<p>of estrogen and testosterone, as well as long-term effects.</p>
<p>These molecules, for those of you that are interested,</p>
<p>are what are called lipophilic,</p>
<p>which just means that they like fatty stuff.</p>
<p>They can actually pass through fatty membranes.</p>
<p>And because the outside of cells,</p>
<p>as well as what&rsquo;s called the nuclear envelope,</p>
<p>where all the DNA contents and stuff are stuffed inside,</p>
<p>are made of lipid, of fat,</p>
<p>these steroid hormones can actually travel into cells</p>
<p>and then get into the DNA,</p>
<p>basically interact with the DNA of cells</p>
<p>in order to control gene expression.</p>
<p>So they can change the sorts of things</p>
<p>that cells will become,</p>
<p>and they can change the way that cells function</p>
<p>in a long-term way.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually how the presence of these genes,</p>
<p>like SRY and mullerian inhibiting hormone,</p>
<p>lead to reductions or elimination, I should say,</p>
<p>of things like the mullerian ducts,</p>
<p>and promote instead what&rsquo;s called in males,</p>
<p>the Wolfian ducts,</p>
<p>or promote the development of testes rather than ovaries.</p>
<p>So all you need to know is that hormones</p>
<p>have short-term and long-term effects.</p>
<p>And the long-term effects are actually related</p>
<p>to their effects on genes</p>
<p>and how those genes are expressed or repressed,</p>
<p>not in order to prevent them</p>
<p>from having particular proteins made.</p>
<p>So these hormones, these steroid hormones,</p>
<p>are exceedingly powerful.</p>
<p>And if we&rsquo;re going to have a discussion</p>
<p>about masculinization or feminization, et cetera,</p>
<p>you also need to think about the counterpart.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about masculinizing the body</p>
<p>or feminizing the body and brain,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also about demasculinizing the brain in many cases</p>
<p>as a normal biological function</p>
<p>typically of XX females,</p>
<p>and defeminization, the suppression of certain pathways</p>
<p>that are related to feminization of the body and brain.</p>
<p>But there are some really fascinating twists in this story.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve just thrown a lot of biology at you,</p>
<p>but this is where it all starts</p>
<p>to get incredibly surprising.</p>
<p>You would think that it&rsquo;s straightforward, right?</p>
<p>You have a Y chromosome,</p>
<p>you suppress the female reproductive pathway</p>
<p>like the mullerian ducts,</p>
<p>you promote the development of testes,</p>
<p>and then testes make testosterone,</p>
<p>and then it organizes the brain male,</p>
<p>and it wants to do male-like things.</p>
<p>And then in females, you get estrogen,</p>
<p>and it wants to do female-like things,</p>
<p>and air quotes here for all of this.</p>
<p>And it turns out that isn&rsquo;t how it works at all.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>We have to understand that there are effects</p>
<p>of these hormones, testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>on what are called primary sexual characteristics,</p>
<p>which are the ones that you&rsquo;re born with,</p>
<p>secondary sexual characteristics,</p>
<p>which are the ones that show up in puberty,</p>
<p>and these are happening in the brain</p>
<p>and body and spinal cord.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m going to disentangle all this for you</p>
<p>by giving you some examples.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s talk about the development</p>
<p>of primary sexual characteristics,</p>
<p>the ones that show up at birth.</p>
<p>And one of the more dramatic examples of this</p>
<p>comes from the role of testosterone</p>
<p>in creating the external genitalia.</p>
<p>Now, you might think it&rsquo;s just straightforward.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s testes, because there&rsquo;s a Y chromosome,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got a gene that codes</p>
<p>for the development of testes,</p>
<p>you get testosterone, and the penis grows,</p>
<p>and the baby is born with a penis.</p>
<p>One of the first things that happens</p>
<p>when the baby comes out is they look at the genitalia,</p>
<p>and they try and make an assessment</p>
<p>of whether or not it&rsquo;s a, quote, boy,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s a, quote, girl, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been done for a very, very long time</p>
<p>in throughout human history.</p>
<p>It turns out that it&rsquo;s not testosterone</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s responsible for the development of the penis</p>
<p>in a baby that has an X chromosome and a Y chromosome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different androgen.</p>
<p>Androgen is just a category of hormones</p>
<p>that includes testosterone,</p>
<p>but testosterone is converted in the fetus</p>
<p>to something called dihydrotestosterone,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s accomplished through an enzyme</p>
<p>called 5-alpha reductase.</p>
<p>Now, dihydrotestosterone has important effects</p>
<p>later in life, too.</p>
<p>We will talk about those.</p>
<p>In fact, if you just want to know,</p>
<p>dihydrotestosterone is what we would call</p>
<p>the dominant androgen in males.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s responsible for aggression.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s responsible for a lot of muscular strength.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s involved in beard growth and male pattern baldness.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about all of that,</p>
<p>but dihydrotestosterone has powerful effects</p>
<p>in determining the genitalia</p>
<p>while the baby is still in the embryo.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s testosterone that&rsquo;s made,</p>
<p>and that testosterone gets converted</p>
<p>by this enzyme, 5-alpha reductase,</p>
<p>in a little structure called the tubercle.</p>
<p>That tubercle will eventually become the penis.</p>
<p>So you say, okay, straightforward.</p>
<p>This testosterone&rsquo;s converted to dihydrotestosterone,</p>
<p>and then if there&rsquo;s dihydrotestosterone,</p>
<p>it controls penis growth.</p>
<p>And indeed, that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a primary sexual characteristic.</p>
<p>That baby will then grow up,</p>
<p>and later, during puberty,</p>
<p>there will be the release of a molecule.</p>
<p>I talked about this last episode called kisspeptin,</p>
<p>K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N, kisspeptin,</p>
<p>which will cause the release of some other hormones,</p>
<p>gonadotropin-releasing hormone,</p>
<p>luteinizing hormone will stimulate the testes</p>
<p>to make testosterone.</p>
<p>So in puberty, testosterone leads to further growth</p>
<p>and development of the penis,</p>
<p>as well as the accumulation or growth of pubic hair,</p>
<p>deepening of the voice,</p>
<p>all the secondary sexual characteristics, okay?</p>
<p>So dihydrotestosterone creates what we would call</p>
<p>the typical masculine phenotype</p>
<p>for primary sexual characteristics,</p>
<p>and produces, testosterone, excuse me,</p>
<p>produces secondary sexual characteristics during puberty.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very interesting phenomenon</p>
<p>that was published in the journal Science in the 1970s,</p>
<p>which now there&rsquo;s a wealth of scientific data,</p>
<p>and this relates to a genetic mutation</p>
<p>where 5-alpha-reductase,</p>
<p>the enzyme that converts testosterone</p>
<p>to dihydrotestosterone, doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mutated in a way in a genome that it doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>And this actually was first identified</p>
<p>in the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>It has shown up elsewhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite rare, but where it shows up, it&rsquo;s robust.</p>
<p>What happens is, baby is born.</p>
<p>Typically, when a baby is born,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t measure chromosomes.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t look at chromosomal sex, XX or XY.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not typically done nowadays.</p>
<p>Baby is born.</p>
<p>If you were to look at that baby, it would look female.</p>
<p>There would be very little or no external penis.</p>
<p>And so people would say, it&rsquo;s a girl,</p>
<p>and they might have the celebration, it&rsquo;s a girl.</p>
<p>And I guess now they call them gender reveal parties</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about this.</p>
<p>But anyway, the baby would reveal its external genitalia</p>
<p>simply by being there and being naked when it&rsquo;s born.</p>
<p>Has nothing to do with gender.</p>
<p>It has to do with genitalia and sex.</p>
<p>That baby would be born.</p>
<p>And what was observed is that from time to time,</p>
<p>that baby, after being raised as a girl,</p>
<p>perfectly happy as a girl,</p>
<p>would, around the age of 11 or 12 or 13,</p>
<p>would suddenly start to sprout a penis.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a name for this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called huevidosis,</p>
<p>which the translation is more or less penis at 12.</p>
<p>And as strange as this might sound,</p>
<p>it makes sense if you understand the underlying mutation.</p>
<p>What happens in these children, these huevidosis,</p>
<p>is that the child is born.</p>
<p>It has testes, which are not descended, so up in the body.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not making a lot of testosterone early on.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t able to convert testosterone</p>
<p>to dihydrotestosterone</p>
<p>because they lack this enzyme, 5-alpha reductase.</p>
<p>As a consequence, the primary sexual characteristic</p>
<p>of external male genitalia, penis, doesn&rsquo;t develop.</p>
<p>And then what happens is the baby grows up</p>
<p>as a young child, essentially is treated as a girl.</p>
<p>Generally, they report being pretty comfortable as girls,</p>
<p>although not always.</p>
<p>And then testosterone starts getting secreted</p>
<p>from the testes because cispeptin in the brain</p>
<p>signals through gonadotropin and luteinizing hormone,</p>
<p>travels down to the testes.</p>
<p>The testes start churning out testosterone,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a secondary growth of the penis.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, there&rsquo;s a penis.</p>
<p>And this leads to some very complicated situations</p>
<p>in families and culturally.</p>
<p>And actually, the outcomes in terms of whether or not</p>
<p>these children decide to self-identify as males or females</p>
<p>and how people treat them actually varies quite a lot.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually been a kind of an adopting</p>
<p>of a third category of sex and gender in the suavidosis</p>
<p>in order to just offer them the opportunity to explore</p>
<p>not just what would be a typical kind of girl or woman</p>
<p>or boy or man phenotype, but something in between,</p>
<p>something that some people call intersex,</p>
<p>although intersex and pseudohermaphroditism</p>
<p>is actually a separate thing altogether.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s fascinating, and the point here</p>
<p>is that dihydrotestosterone, not testosterone,</p>
<p>is responsible for this primary growth of the penis,</p>
<p>and that testosterone later is involved</p>
<p>in the secondary sexual characteristics,</p>
<p>deepening in the voice, et cetera.</p>
<p>Now, this is where the information</p>
<p>gets even more interesting</p>
<p>and applies to essentially everybody.</p>
<p>You might think that testosterone,</p>
<p>because it masculinizes the body</p>
<p>in the secondary sexual characteristic way,</p>
<p>and because dihydrotestosterone, another androgen,</p>
<p>masculinizes the primary sexual characteristics,</p>
<p>the growth of the penis early on,</p>
<p>that testosterone must masculinize the brain.</p>
<p>And there are, in fact, aspects of masculinization</p>
<p>of the brain and body that are independent of genitalia.</p>
<p>Now, it might be obvious to some of you,</p>
<p>but some people probably don&rsquo;t realize that.</p>
<p>Yes, indeed, the brain has receptors for testosterone.</p>
<p>It also has receptors for estrogen.</p>
<p>But the fascinating thing is that</p>
<p>if you look at the brains of people that have Y chromosomes</p>
<p>and that have testes and that make testosterone,</p>
<p>and you look at the brains of people</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have Y chromosomes or testes</p>
<p>and therefore make far less testosterone in general,</p>
<p>what you realize is that the cells in the brain</p>
<p>that differ between what I&rsquo;ll call males and females,</p>
<p>but between XY and XX,</p>
<p>have receptors for testosterone,</p>
<p>but the masculinization of the brain</p>
<p>is not accomplished by testosterone.</p>
<p>I want to repeat this.</p>
<p>The masculinization of the brain</p>
<p>is not accomplished by testosterone.</p>
<p>It is accomplished by estrogen.</p>
<p>Testosterone can be converted into estrogen</p>
<p>by an enzyme called aromatase.</p>
<p>This is vitally important to understand.</p>
<p>Testosterone can be converted into estrogen</p>
<p>by something called aromatase.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give an example of where this happens later in life</p>
<p>to just illustrate the principle</p>
<p>and really embed it in your mind.</p>
<p>During puberty in boys, XY chromosome individuals,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not uncommon for there to be transient</p>
<p>or sometimes long-lasting breast bud development.</p>
<p>Testosterone goes up during puberty,</p>
<p>the reasons we talked about before,</p>
<p>and some of that testosterone gets converted into estrogen</p>
<p>by an enzyme called aromatase.</p>
<p>Aromatase is made by several sources in the body.</p>
<p>One of the main sources is body fat,</p>
<p>so it can make a lot of aromatase.</p>
<p>Sometimes you&rsquo;ll even see a fairly dramatic</p>
<p>breast development in males during puberty.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s transient, sometimes it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>The other place where you see this</p>
<p>is in athletes and bodybuilders</p>
<p>that take a lot of anabolic steroids,</p>
<p>that take high levels of androgens,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;ll be taking testosterone</p>
<p>at super physiological doses.</p>
<p>Sometimes, not always,</p>
<p>they will convert some of that testosterone into estrogen,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll get what&rsquo;s called gynecomastia,</p>
<p>which is the development of male breast tissue.</p>
<p>Sometimes they&rsquo;ll get it cut out surgically.</p>
<p>Other times they&rsquo;ll start trying to take estrogen blockers</p>
<p>in order to try and suppress it,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ll try and block prolactin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a topic that we&rsquo;re going to get into in more detail,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s important here is to understand</p>
<p>that testosterone can be converted</p>
<p>into the estrogen by aromatase.</p>
<p>Aromatase is not just made in body fat.</p>
<p>There are neurons in the brain that make aromatase</p>
<p>and convert testosterone into estrogen,</p>
<p>and it is testosterone converted into estrogen.</p>
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s estrogen that masculinizes</p>
<p>the XY individual, that masculinizes the brain,</p>
<p>and this has profound effects on all sorts of things,</p>
<p>on behavior, on outlook in the world, et cetera,</p>
<p>but I think most people don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s estrogen that comes from testosterone</p>
<p>that masculinizes the male brain, the XY brain,</p>
<p>not testosterone nor dihydrotestosterone.</p>
<p>So I just want to mention some tools.</p>
<p>You might be asking yourself,</p>
<p>how could tools possibly come up</p>
<p>at this stage of the conversation</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re talking about sexual development</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re talking about the differentiation</p>
<p>of tissues in the body?</p>
<p>Well, this is true both for children and parents and adults.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that there are things</p>
<p>that are environmental,</p>
<p>and there are things that people use</p>
<p>in their homes sometimes</p>
<p>that actually can impact hormone levels</p>
<p>and can impact sexual development in fairly profound ways,</p>
<p>and I want to be very clear.</p>
<p>This is not me pulling from some rare journal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard of it.</p>
<p>This is pulling from textbooks.</p>
<p>In particular, today I&rsquo;m guiding a lot of the conversation</p>
<p>on work on behavioral endocrinology.</p>
<p>This is a book by Randy Nelson and Lance Crigfield,</p>
<p>true experts in the field.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to talk about some of the work from Tyrone Hayes</p>
<p>from UC Berkeley about environmental toxins</p>
<p>and their impacts on some of these things</p>
<p>like testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to touch into them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to give some anecdotal evidence</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s grounded in studies,</p>
<p>which we will provide in the caption</p>
<p>or that I&rsquo;ll reference here.</p>
<p>One of those that&rsquo;s actually really interesting</p>
<p>but helps illustrate the principle</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been talking about is a few years ago,</p>
<p>there was a lot of excitement about evening primrose oil,</p>
<p>evening primrose oil is in a lot of products</p>
<p>that typically are associated with skin beauty</p>
<p>and skin health.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m generalizing here,</p>
<p>but typically it was mothers or sisters that were using it.</p>
<p>And there were actually examples starting to crop up</p>
<p>of young boys getting accelerated breast bud development</p>
<p>from skin contact with women</p>
<p>who were using evening primrose oil.</p>
<p>So evening primrose oil is chemically</p>
<p>a lot like estrogen</p>
<p>and it has a lot of estrogenic compounds.</p>
<p>There are a number of things out there like this.</p>
<p>So believe it or not,</p>
<p>things like pine pollen look very much like testosterone.</p>
<p>Structurally, they are more or less are testosterone.</p>
<p>Their bioavailability in humans isn&rsquo;t as clear.</p>
<p>Evening primrose oil has a lot of estrogenic elements</p>
<p>to it, just structurally how it&rsquo;s built.</p>
<p>And so there were cases where boys were understandably,</p>
<p>you know, being hugged by their mom</p>
<p>or maybe even like showering and taking a,</p>
<p>you know, using the evening primrose oil solution.</p>
<p>Those things will actually change levels of estrogens</p>
<p>in boys and girls.</p>
<p>And so this wasn&rsquo;t just an issue for young boys.</p>
<p>This was also an issue for young girls.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that evening primrose oil is bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that many of you have probably heard</p>
<p>about the dangers of soys and isoflavones</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>The impact of soy on estrogen levels is,</p>
<p>there are some decent evidence to support that.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s a lot of other factors</p>
<p>that are more severe.</p>
<p>And one of those is this evening primrose oil.</p>
<p>So regardless of age, if, let&rsquo;s just put it this way,</p>
<p>because people might be wanting to drive their hormones</p>
<p>more estrogenic or more androgenic.</p>
<p>How could I know what your preference is?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But in any case, things like evening primrose oil</p>
<p>can actually promote estrogenic pathways in the body.</p>
<p>And some of it can go transdermal.</p>
<p>Likewise, because testosterone replacement therapy</p>
<p>is fairly widespread nowadays.</p>
<p>And some people accomplish that through cream.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty well understood that if someone&rsquo;s taking that,</p>
<p>that they want to avoid contact with anyone,</p>
<p>skin contact with anyone that is trying to promote</p>
<p>more estrogenic activity in their body.</p>
<p>And especially in children.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>The other is this issue of environmental factors.</p>
<p>Now this, again, I&rsquo;m just going to highlight</p>
<p>when one starts talking about environmental factors</p>
<p>and how they&rsquo;re poisoning us or disrupting growth</p>
<p>or fertility rates, it can start to sound a little bit crazy</p>
<p>except when you start to actually look at</p>
<p>some of the real data.</p>
<p>Data from quality research labs</p>
<p>funded by federal government,</p>
<p>funded not from companies or other sources</p>
<p>that are really aimed at understanding</p>
<p>what the underlying biology is.</p>
<p>And for that, I really, we should all be grateful</p>
<p>to Tyrone Hayes at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>I remember way back when I was a graduate student</p>
<p>in the late nineties, goodness, at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>And I remember him, he was studying frogs.</p>
<p>He was talking about developmental defects in these frogs</p>
<p>that live in different waters around.</p>
<p>It was California, but also elsewhere.</p>
<p>And he identified a substance,</p>
<p>which is present in a lot of waterways</p>
<p>throughout this country and other countries.</p>
<p>So U.S. and beyond,</p>
<p>certainly not just restricted to California,</p>
<p>which is atrazine.</p>
<p>This is A-T-R-A-Z-I-N-E.</p>
<p>Again, this is the stuff of textbooks</p>
<p>and it causes severe testicular malformations.</p>
<p>So again, atrazine exposure is serious.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting is if you look at the data,</p>
<p>what you find is that at sites in Western</p>
<p>and Midwestern sections of the United States,</p>
<p>10 to 92% of male frogs, these were frogs, mind you,</p>
<p>had testicular abnormalities.</p>
<p>And the most severe testicular malformations</p>
<p>were in the testes rather than in the sperm.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s actually the organ itself, the gonad itself.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s very well known now</p>
<p>that atrazine is in many herbicides.</p>
<p>And so, whereas I would say in the 80s and 90s,</p>
<p>the discussion around herbicides and their negative effects</p>
<p>was considered kind of like hippy-dippy stuff</p>
<p>or the stuff you hear about at your local community markets</p>
<p>and these kind of new agey communities.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s very solid data from federally funded labs</p>
<p>at major universities that have been peer-reviewed</p>
<p>and published in excellent journals</p>
<p>showing that indeed many of these herbicides</p>
<p>can have negative effects</p>
<p>primarily by impacting the ratios of these hormones</p>
<p>in either the mothers or in the testes,</p>
<p>altering the testes of the fathers</p>
<p>or direct effects on developing young animals.</p>
<p>And potentially humans.</p>
<p>And so you ask, well, what about humans?</p>
<p>Frogs are wonderful, but what about humans?</p>
<p>So here are the data on what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>And this isn&rsquo;t all going to be scary stuff.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also going to talk about tools to ameliorate</p>
<p>and offset some of these effects.</p>
<p>One would be, be cautious with evening primrose</p>
<p>as well as testosterone creams,</p>
<p>depending on whether or not you want to be more androgenic</p>
<p>or estrogenic, depending on your needs.</p>
<p>But across human populations,</p>
<p>sperm counts are indeed declining, okay?</p>
<p>So in 1940, the average density of human sperm</p>
<p>was 113 million per milliliter of semen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s measured.</p>
<p>How many sperm per milliliter of semen?</p>
<p>In 1990, this figure has dropped to 66.</p>
<p>So it went from 113 million per milliliter</p>
<p>to 66 million per milliliter</p>
<p>in the United States and Western Europe.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just a US thing.</p>
<p>Researchers also estimated that the volume of semen</p>
<p>produced by men has dropped 20% in that time,</p>
<p>reduced sperm count per ejaculation even further.</p>
<p>So between 1981 and 1991,</p>
<p>the ratio of normal spermatogenesis has decreased</p>
<p>from 56.4% to 26.9%.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot that&rsquo;s happening primarily</p>
<p>because of these herbicides that are in widespread use</p>
<p>to reduce sperm counts.</p>
<p>And these are going to have profound effects,</p>
<p>not just on sperm counts, but on development,</p>
<p>sexual development at the level of the gonads and the brain,</p>
<p>because you need testosterone to get dihydrotestosterone</p>
<p>for primary sexual characteristics.</p>
<p>You need estrogen that&rsquo;s come from testosterone</p>
<p>to masculinize the brain.</p>
<p>And of course, we&rsquo;re not just focusing</p>
<p>on sperm and testosterone.</p>
<p>You, of course, also know that many of these herbicides</p>
<p>are disrupting estrogens in a similar way</p>
<p>or are leading to hyperestrogenic, excuse me, states,</p>
<p>which might explain why puberty is happening</p>
<p>so much earlier in young girls these days.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of things that are happening.</p>
<p>Now, does this mean that you have to run around</p>
<p>and neurotically avoid anything</p>
<p>that includes things like atrazine?</p>
<p>And should you be avoiding all kinds of herbicides?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s up to you.</p>
<p>But it does seem that these have pretty marked effects</p>
<p>in both the animal studies and in the human studies.</p>
<p>You know, you can open up a textbook</p>
<p>like the endocrinology textbook</p>
<p>and find things like vinclozolin.</p>
<p>This is V-I-N-C-L-O-Z-O-L-I-N,</p>
<p>which is a fungicide and it&rsquo;s an antiandrogen.</p>
<p>You give it to animals, to rats,</p>
<p>and instead of forming a penis, they don&rsquo;t form a penis.</p>
<p>They basically, it&rsquo;s not that they form a clitoris,</p>
<p>they just don&rsquo;t form a penis.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about female sexual development.</p>
<p>And as always, what we&rsquo;ll do</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;ll talk about the normal biology.</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;ll talk a little bit about a kind of extraordinary</p>
<p>or unusual set of cases, but we&rsquo;ll talk about them</p>
<p>because they illustrate an important principle</p>
<p>about how things work under typical circumstances.</p>
<p>So there is a mutation</p>
<p>called androgen insensitivity syndrome.</p>
<p>And understanding how androgen insensitivity syndrome works</p>
<p>can help you really understand</p>
<p>how hormones impact sexual development.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>There are individuals who are XY,</p>
<p>so they have a Y chromosome,</p>
<p>that are born, that make testosterone.</p>
<p>They have testes and they don&rsquo;t have Mullerian ducts</p>
<p>because on the Y chromosome</p>
<p>is this Mullerian inhibiting hormone.</p>
<p>However, these individuals look completely female.</p>
<p>And in general, they report feeling like girls</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re young, women when they&rsquo;re older.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something unusual that&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in these individuals because they have an XY chromosomal</p>
<p>type and not XX.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s happening?</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s happening is the testes are making testosterone,</p>
<p>but the receptor for testosterone is mutated.</p>
<p>And therefore the testes never descend.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have ovaries, they have testes,</p>
<p>but the testes are internal.</p>
<p>And so typically these individuals find out</p>
<p>that they are actually XY chromosomes</p>
<p>so that their chromosomal sex is male, if you will,</p>
<p>and their gonadal sex is male,</p>
<p>but the gonads, the testes are inside the body.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t actually develop a scrotum.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t make ovaries.</p>
<p>And when they don&rsquo;t menstruate around the time of puberty,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a sign that something is different.</p>
<p>And so they never menstruate around puberty.</p>
<p>And if they look into this deeply enough,</p>
<p>what you find is that they are actually XY,</p>
<p>they make testosterone,</p>
<p>but their body can&rsquo;t make use of the testosterone</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t have the receptors.</p>
<p>And the receptors are vitally important</p>
<p>for most all of the secondary sexual characteristics</p>
<p>that we talked about, body hair,</p>
<p>penis growth during puberty, et cetera.</p>
<p>They live fairly happy lives as females,</p>
<p>although of course they can&rsquo;t conceive, right?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have a uterus.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have ovaries.</p>
<p>They also in general don&rsquo;t produce sperm</p>
<p>in quantities enough that they could actually reproduce</p>
<p>with somebody else, although sometimes they can.</p>
<p>And believe it or not, and I&rsquo;m not going to name names,</p>
<p>but there are actually reports of several people,</p>
<p>fairly prominent people throughout history</p>
<p>who have had this androgen insensitivity syndrome</p>
<p>or people suspected they did.</p>
<p>And the reason to not name names</p>
<p>is that it gets right to the heart</p>
<p>of whether or not they are male or female.</p>
<p>How could you say, right?</p>
<p>They have XY chromosomes,</p>
<p>but gonadally they have testes that are inside.</p>
<p>And yet, if you looked at their bodies,</p>
<p>if you looked at their faces,</p>
<p>you would say almost with certainty</p>
<p>that they appeared female.</p>
<p>And that naturally occurring experiment</p>
<p>points to the fact that testosterone</p>
<p>that shows up in the body and impacts the things</p>
<p>at the levels of the receptor</p>
<p>has a profound effect on phenotype,</p>
<p>on the external or body plan.</p>
<p>So again, we&rsquo;re talking about this</p>
<p>in order to illustrate the principle</p>
<p>that in order to have its effects,</p>
<p>a hormone doesn&rsquo;t just have to be present,</p>
<p>that hormone actually has to be able to bind its receptor</p>
<p>and take action on the target cells.</p>
<p>And once again, I&rsquo;ll just throw out the example</p>
<p>of where people are using performance enhancing drugs,</p>
<p>although that&rsquo;s a pretty broad statement.</p>
<p>Nowadays, there&rsquo;s a lot of excitement</p>
<p>about the so-called SARMs,</p>
<p>which are more on the receptor side.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ll talk about this in a future episode.</p>
<p>And I just say that as a teaser</p>
<p>because the SARMs and what&rsquo;s happening right now</p>
<p>in augmenting sports performance,</p>
<p>both with testosterone directly,</p>
<p>but also testosterone derivatives,</p>
<p>and then also altering things at the level of the receptor</p>
<p>is exceedingly interesting</p>
<p>and is revealing to us the many ways</p>
<p>in which hormones can impact brain and body</p>
<p>in ways that we didn&rsquo;t suspect.</p>
<p>Perhaps the simplest way to understand</p>
<p>how estrogen and testosterone impact masculinization</p>
<p>or feminization of the brain and behavior</p>
<p>is from a statement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually the closing sentence of an abstract</p>
<p>that my colleague Niral Shah</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine published,</p>
<p>which is that estrogen,</p>
<p>again, it&rsquo;s estrogen that is aromatized from testosterone</p>
<p>by aromatase,</p>
<p>sets up the masculine repertoire of sexual</p>
<p>and in animals and in humans, territorial behaviors.</p>
<p>So it sets up the circuitry in the brain.</p>
<p>Estrogen does that.</p>
<p>Estrogen sets up the masculine circuitry in the brain.</p>
<p>And testosterone is then what controls</p>
<p>the display of those behaviors later in life.</p>
<p>And I find that incredibly interesting.</p>
<p>You would think it was just testosterone did one thing</p>
<p>and estrogen did another,</p>
<p>but it turns out that nature</p>
<p>is far more interesting than that.</p>
<p>Okay, so what are some things</p>
<p>that impact sexual development early in life</p>
<p>and later in life?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about cannabis.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about alcohol.</p>
<p>And dare I say, let&rsquo;s talk about cell phones,</p>
<p>something that I never thought I would ever do</p>
<p>either in this podcast or in the classroom,</p>
<p>but these days there are really interesting data</p>
<p>and I think you should be aware of them.</p>
<p>First of all, cannabis, marijuana, THC.</p>
<p>I realize that there are now</p>
<p>a lot of different variants on this.</p>
<p>There are a lot of different strains of cannabis.</p>
<p>I personally am not a pot smoker.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about the moral or legal implications.</p>
<p>You know, in some states it&rsquo;s decriminalized,</p>
<p>in other places it&rsquo;s really illegal,</p>
<p>in other places it&rsquo;s basically legal.</p>
<p>You have to check, you know,</p>
<p>where you live and understand the laws.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what this is about.</p>
<p>What we do know, however,</p>
<p>is that with the exception of one study,</p>
<p>there are many studies that point to the fact</p>
<p>that THC and other things in cannabis</p>
<p>promote significant increases in aromatase activity.</p>
<p>Now, pot smokers aren&rsquo;t going to like this,</p>
<p>especially male pot smokers aren&rsquo;t going to like this,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the reality.</p>
<p>Remember, what you&rsquo;re hearing in the background</p>
<p>is Costello snoring really loud.</p>
<p>Should we put him on screen?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not a cannabis smoker, but you can imagine why.</p>
<p>Here, come here, Costello.</p>
<p>Come here, buddy, come here.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s asleep.</p>
<p>Come here.</p>
<p>He might come here.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>This dog definitely does not need cannabis.</p>
<p>This is his state for most of the time.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s highly paranoid.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s asleep still.</p>
<p>So some of you have asked to see Costello.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re just listening on audio,</p>
<p>maybe he&rsquo;ll give us some, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, we&rsquo;re going to let him get back to sleep.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s always here.</p>
<p>Some of you have asked to see him.</p>
<p>Costello&rsquo;s not a pot smoker either.</p>
<p>He did have a dog sitter that was a pot smoker years ago.</p>
<p>It was his favorite dog sitter, but I&rsquo;m not a pot smoker.</p>
<p>Again, no judgment, but here&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>That cannabis, and it&rsquo;s not clear if it&rsquo;s THC itself</p>
<p>or other elements in the marijuana plant</p>
<p>promote aromatase activity.</p>
<p>Now, this has been observed anecdotally</p>
<p>where pot smokers have a higher incidence</p>
<p>of developing something I mentioned before,</p>
<p>gynecomastia, breast bud development</p>
<p>or full-blown breast development in males.</p>
<p>There may be some women who want to increase</p>
<p>their estrogenic activity.</p>
<p>Remember, females make testosterone.</p>
<p>It comes from the adrenals, right?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have testes, so it comes from the adrenals.</p>
<p>And that testosterone can also be aromatized.</p>
<p>Although typically most of the aromatase activity</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re referring to in these examples is in males.</p>
<p>So testosterone can increase estrogenic activity.</p>
<p>So you might say, oh, you know,</p>
<p>therefore does testosterone reduce sexual behavior?</p>
<p>Does it create all sorts of things that are related</p>
<p>to low testosterone?</p>
<p>Not necessarily, not necessarily.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>Estrogen itself in males and females is important</p>
<p>for things like libido and sexual behavior.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to repeat that.</p>
<p>If estrogen is too low in males,</p>
<p>it can actually inhibit libido and sexual behavior.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t want estrogen too high or too low,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re male or female.</p>
<p>Now, of course, in females,</p>
<p>estrogen levels tend to be higher than in males.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speaking very generally here.</p>
<p>You just think back to the chromosomal sex.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m referring to when I say male or female,</p>
<p>although there&rsquo;s nuance there, of course.</p>
<p>In females, the testosterone that comes from the adrenals</p>
<p>has a powerful effect on libido and desire to reproduce.</p>
<p>And in the next episode,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to talk about how that works</p>
<p>in its relationship to birth control,</p>
<p>its relationship to menopause.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also going to talk about</p>
<p>how that whole thing works in males as well.</p>
<p>But cannabis and other aspects of the marijuana plant</p>
<p>can impact levels of testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>by increasing aromatase.</p>
<p>And so people should be aware of that.</p>
<p>As well, there are good data.</p>
<p>I was able to find several studies on PubMed</p>
<p>pointing to the fact that smoking marijuana</p>
<p>during pregnancy can shift the pattern of hormones</p>
<p>in the developing fetus,</p>
<p>such that it promotes more estrogenic outcomes.</p>
<p>Now, earlier I said that estrogen</p>
<p>is what masculinizes the male brain.</p>
<p>In utero, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>But the way that cannabis seems to work,</p>
<p>at least from the studies I was able to identify,</p>
<p>is that it promotes circulating estrogen in the body</p>
<p>and therefore can counteract</p>
<p>some of the masculinizing effects of things like testosterone</p>
<p>and dihydrotestosterone</p>
<p>on primary and secondary sexual characteristics.</p>
<p>So I mentioned this because I think nowadays</p>
<p>marijuana use is far more widespread.</p>
<p>And certainly during puberty,</p>
<p>it can have profound effects on these hormonal systems.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ll do another episode</p>
<p>that goes really deep into this.</p>
<p>But yes, cannabis promotes estrogenic activity</p>
<p>by increasing aromatase.</p>
<p>Most everyone can appreciate that drinking during pregnancy</p>
<p>is not good for the developing fetus.</p>
<p>Fetal alcohol syndrome</p>
<p>is a well-established negative outcome of pregnancy.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something that there are cognitive effects</p>
<p>that are really bad.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually physical malformation, et cetera.</p>
<p>So drinking during pregnancy, not good.</p>
<p>Probably drinking during puberty, not good either,</p>
<p>because alcohol, in particular, certain things like beer,</p>
<p>but other grain alcohols can increase estrogenic activity.</p>
<p>Now, this isn&rsquo;t just about protecting young boys</p>
<p>from estrogenic activity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also protecting girls from excessive</p>
<p>or even hypoestrogenic effects of alcohol in puberty.</p>
<p>Now, many teenagers drink, college students drink,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s important to point out</p>
<p>that puberty doesn&rsquo;t start on one day</p>
<p>and end on another day.</p>
<p>Puberty has a beginning, a middle, and an end,</p>
<p>but development is really our entire lifespan.</p>
<p>This idea that puberty has us open and close,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just false.</p>
<p>Okay, so we talked about cannabis.</p>
<p>We talked about alcohol.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about cell phones.</p>
<p>First of all, I use a cell phone.</p>
<p>I use it very often,</p>
<p>and I do not think they are evil devices.</p>
<p>I think that they require some discipline</p>
<p>in order to make sure</p>
<p>that it does not become a negative force in one&rsquo;s life,</p>
<p>so I personally restrict the number of hours</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m on the phone, and in particular, on social media.</p>
<p>I only answer email at particular times of day,</p>
<p>but what about the cell phone itself?</p>
<p>When I was a junior professor,</p>
<p>so pre-tenure, early professor,</p>
<p>I taught this class on neural circuits</p>
<p>and health and disease,</p>
<p>and one of the students asked me,</p>
<p>are cell phones safe for the brain?</p>
<p>And all the data point to the fact that they were,</p>
<p>or at least there were no data showing that it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t have the answer on that, frankly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see a lot of studies about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not personally aware of any evidence</p>
<p>in quality peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>showing that cell phones are bad for the brain</p>
<p>or that holding the phone to the ear is bad</p>
<p>or that Bluetooth is bad or any of that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not aware of any quality studies.</p>
<p>If you are aware of quality studies, peer-reviewed studies,</p>
<p>please reference them, put them in the comment section,</p>
<p>send them to me, however you like.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not aware of them.</p>
<p>However, I was very interested in a particular study</p>
<p>that was published back in 2013 on rats.</p>
<p>It was basically took a cell phone</p>
<p>and put it under a cage of rats</p>
<p>and looked at basically testicular</p>
<p>and ovarian development in rats</p>
<p>and saw minor but still statistically significant defects</p>
<p>in ovarian and testicular development.</p>
<p>Since then, and now returning to the literature,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a absolute explosion of studies,</p>
<p>some of which are in quality journals,</p>
<p>some of which are in what I would call</p>
<p>not blue ribbon journals,</p>
<p>identifying defects in testicular</p>
<p>and or ovarian development by mere exposure</p>
<p>to cell phone emitted waves.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just call that.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what they are.</p>
<p>And this sounds almost crazy, right?</p>
<p>Anytime somebody starts talking about EMFs</p>
<p>and things like that, you kind of worry like,</p>
<p>is this person okay?</p>
<p>But look, the literature are pointing in a direction</p>
<p>where chronic exposure of the gonads to cell phones</p>
<p>could be creating serious issues in terms of the health</p>
<p>at the cellular level and in terms of the output.</p>
<p>So the output for the testes would be sperm production,</p>
<p>swimming speed in sperm is an important feature</p>
<p>of sperm health.</p>
<p>In the ovaries, it would be estrogenic output,</p>
<p>how regular the cycles are.</p>
<p>So in animals, the cycles are a little bit different</p>
<p>than in humans.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have a menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>They have an estrous cycle,</p>
<p>which is generally around four days.</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;s fair to say, based on the literature,</p>
<p>that there are effects of cell phone emitted waves</p>
<p>on gonadal development.</p>
<p>The question is, what is the proximity of the cell phone</p>
<p>to the gonads?</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve taken the literature as I observe it,</p>
<p>and then of course, we&rsquo;ll point you to in the captions.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t like to have my cell phone on and in my pocket.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m well past puberty, but nonetheless,</p>
<p>some of these effects were seen in adult animals.</p>
<p>There are effects now that have been demonstrated in humans.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just talk about a couple of those effects.</p>
<p>So a paper published in the journal,</p>
<p>Clinical Biochemistry from Eskander et al,</p>
<p>looked at hormone profiles in people</p>
<p>based on proximity to their phone</p>
<p>and frequency of phone use,</p>
<p>where they stored their phone on their body,</p>
<p>as well as proximity of where they lived to,</p>
<p>I guess they&rsquo;re called these radio frequency towers,</p>
<p>so the base stations.</p>
<p>And they were looking at effects of radio frequency,</p>
<p>radiation, RFR, on human hormone profiles.</p>
<p>And they show significant decreases in cortisol.</p>
<p>You might say, well, that might be good,</p>
<p>but you need that morning cortisol bump</p>
<p>in order to wake up.</p>
<p>Morning cortisol is good.</p>
<p>But also thyroid hormones were significantly reduced.</p>
<p>Prolactin in young females, that&rsquo;s definitely concerning.</p>
<p>And testosterone levels in males and females.</p>
<p>And so there are now quite good data showing</p>
<p>that being close to the phone too much of the day,</p>
<p>and how close is an interesting question,</p>
<p>or living near one of these base stations,</p>
<p>apparently can have effects on hormone profiles.</p>
<p>And when you see a study like this,</p>
<p>one should always ask, well, what are the other things</p>
<p>that could also have effects on these hormone profiles?</p>
<p>Because you could imagine that if you ran the same study</p>
<p>of people that live close to a waterway</p>
<p>or close to a highway,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a lot of exhaust from buses and cars,</p>
<p>you might see similar effects.</p>
<p>So you have to take these sorts of studies</p>
<p>with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>And given that the last time I looked into these data,</p>
<p>where way back when I was a junior professor,</p>
<p>and there was like one or two studies that I could find,</p>
<p>one of the studies pointed to increases in testosterone</p>
<p>in rats where they had close proximity</p>
<p>to these radio frequency radiation waves.</p>
<p>And then in the other case,</p>
<p>it showed decreases in testosterone.</p>
<p>So there really wasn&rsquo;t any conclusion to take away from that.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s pretty impressive amount of data</p>
<p>pointing to the fact that there are effects</p>
<p>of these things on hormones.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to do with that information.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to stop using my phone,</p>
<p>but in light of the work from Tyrone Hayes and others</p>
<p>looking at sperm counts and looking at the decrease</p>
<p>in testosterone levels and sperm counts and fertility</p>
<p>over the last 20, 30 years,</p>
<p>perhaps it&rsquo;s not surprising.</p>
<p>Although there again, cell phones and smartphones</p>
<p>have really been in prominent use</p>
<p>mostly within the last 10 or 11 years.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s hard to explain all of those declines</p>
<p>simply on the basis of cell phone use.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some interesting effects of hormones</p>
<p>that actually you can observe on the outside of people</p>
<p>that tell you something about</p>
<p>not just their level of hormones,</p>
<p>but also about their underlying genetics.</p>
<p>And these relate to beard growth and baldness.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>The molecule, the hormone, dihydrotestosterone</p>
<p>made from testosterone is the hormone</p>
<p>primarily responsible for facial hair, for beard growth.</p>
<p>As well, it&rsquo;s the molecule,</p>
<p>the hormone primarily responsible for lack of hair</p>
<p>on the head for hair loss.</p>
<p>So how does that work?</p>
<p>Well, DHT circulates in the body</p>
<p>and it binds to DHT receptors in the face</p>
<p>to promote hair growth,</p>
<p>but it binds to DHT receptors on the scalp</p>
<p>to promote hair loss.</p>
<p>Not incidentally,</p>
<p>the drugs that are designed to prevent hair loss</p>
<p>are 5-alpha reductase inhibitors.</p>
<p>So remember 5-alpha reductase from the huevidosis?</p>
<p>Well, the people that discovered the huevidosis</p>
<p>went on to do a lot of research</p>
<p>on the underlying biochemistry</p>
<p>of this really interesting molecule, dihydrotestosterone,</p>
<p>the identified 5-alpha reductase.</p>
<p>And 5-alpha reductase inhibitors</p>
<p>are the basis of most of the anti-hair loss treatments</p>
<p>that are out there.</p>
<p>And so there are some interesting things here.</p>
<p>First of all, the side effect profiles</p>
<p>of those treatments for hair loss</p>
<p>are quite severe in many individuals.</p>
<p>Remember, DHT is the primary androgen for libido,</p>
<p>for strength and connective tissue repair,</p>
<p>for aggression, even if that aggression, of course,</p>
<p>is held in check,</p>
<p>but just sort of ambition and aggression</p>
<p>is related to dopamine,</p>
<p>but within the testosterone pathway,</p>
<p>less so pure testosterone,</p>
<p>although pure testosterone has its effects,</p>
<p>but DHT is, at least in primate species, including humans,</p>
<p>is the dominant androgen</p>
<p>for most of those sorts of effects.</p>
<p>And if you look at somebody,</p>
<p>everyone can predict whether or not they&rsquo;re going to go bald</p>
<p>based on looking at their,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re always taught, our mother&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>So if your mother&rsquo;s father was bald,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a higher probability that you&rsquo;re going to go bald.</p>
<p>The pattern of DHT receptors on the scalp</p>
<p>will dictate whether or not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to go bald everywhere</p>
<p>or just in the front or crown-type baldness.</p>
<p>And the density of the beard</p>
<p>tells you about the density of DHT receptors.</p>
<p>Now, this varies by background, by genetic background.</p>
<p>And actually, around the world nowadays,</p>
<p>because people travel and people form couples</p>
<p>and have kids with so many different people</p>
<p>of different mixed cultures,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re seeing this starting to disappear,</p>
<p>but there are areas of the world</p>
<p>where all the men seem to be,</p>
<p>have the same pattern of baldness,</p>
<p>like a strip of baldness down the center</p>
<p>with hair still on the sides and full beards.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because these patterns of DHT receptors</p>
<p>are genetically determined.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, testosterone levels can still be very high.</p>
<p>DHT levels in the blood can be very high,</p>
<p>and yet people will have very light beards or no beards,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a lot of DHT receptors in the face.</p>
<p>And still other cultures,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see people with huge beards,</p>
<p>tons of beard,</p>
<p>like their beards are growing all the way up to their eyes,</p>
<p>and they have huge heads of hair,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because they have a lot of DHT receptors</p>
<p>on the face and not on the scalp.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of effects of DHT</p>
<p>that you can just see in male phenotypes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting that these hair loss drugs</p>
<p>that are to prevent hair loss drugs</p>
<p>are directly aimed at preventing</p>
<p>the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why they, to some extent, prevent hair loss,</p>
<p>but also to some extent have a bunch of side effects</p>
<p>that are associated with low DHT.</p>
<p>Along these lines,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a particular sports supplement</p>
<p>that a lot of people use called creatine.</p>
<p>Creatine, now there&rsquo;s a lot of research</p>
<p>showing that creatine can bring more water into the muscle.</p>
<p>It can support strength.</p>
<p>It does a number of other things.</p>
<p>Might even have some important cognitive enhancement effects,</p>
<p>although mild.</p>
<p>The studies there show that it can be significant.</p>
<p>Some people, not all, it&rsquo;s more anecdotal,</p>
<p>report that creatine promotes hair loss.</p>
<p>It differs by individual.</p>
<p>For some people, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>For others, no.</p>
<p>But yes, it does appear,</p>
<p>based on the studies I was able to find on PubMed,</p>
<p>that creatine does promote 5-alpha-reductase activity,</p>
<p>and therefore the conversion of testosterone</p>
<p>into dihydrotestosterone,</p>
<p>and so it makes sense that it might promote</p>
<p>some degree of hair loss, as well as beard growth,</p>
<p>as well as the other effects of DHT.</p>
<p>I recall in junior high school and middle school,</p>
<p>going home one summer, it was seventh grade,</p>
<p>coming back in the eighth grade,</p>
<p>and a kid that I knew that I was friends with</p>
<p>went from being like a young kid to,</p>
<p>he was like a grown man, he had a full beard.</p>
<p>It was amazing.</p>
<p>It was like he would completely transform.</p>
<p>I mean, puberty, as I&rsquo;ve said before,</p>
<p>is without a doubt the most accelerated rate of development</p>
<p>that we will go through at any point in our lives,</p>
<p>even faster than infancy,</p>
<p>just in terms of the huge number of different</p>
<p>cognitive changes and physical changes.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, that same individual</p>
<p>was mostly, or balled, by his early 20s,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because he must have had</p>
<p>just exceedingly high levels of DHT.</p>
<p>I also played soccer with this kid</p>
<p>and he was basically like dribbling past everybody.</p>
<p>He was like a grown man playing soccer</p>
<p>with a bunch of little kids.</p>
<p>Full beard, balled at 20.</p>
<p>And so the rate of maturation, the rate of aging,</p>
<p>is very interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know rate of aging.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some genetic tests that now can allow you to do that,</p>
<p>things like Horvath clocks and things of that sort.</p>
<p>Beautiful work of David Sinclair at Harvard and others</p>
<p>has pointed to this.</p>
<p>The speed of entry and exit from puberty might be,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m putting it out there as a hypothesis,</p>
<p>might be an interesting window</p>
<p>into how fast one is going through</p>
<p>their aging or developmental arc,</p>
<p>because development, of course,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t just start at birth and end after puberty.</p>
<p>It continues your entire life.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>You will often see that people, boys and girls,</p>
<p>I should say boys or girls,</p>
<p>will develop secondary sexual characteristics</p>
<p>at different rates, and sometimes it&rsquo;s sequential.</p>
<p>You might see a kid will, she&rsquo;ll grow very tall</p>
<p>or she&rsquo;ll have a big growth spurt,</p>
<p>but then breast development will come a little bit later.</p>
<p>And then other features will come a little bit later.</p>
<p>You can also see this in boys.</p>
<p>The person that I referred to earlier,</p>
<p>my friend that developed full beard, went bald.</p>
<p>He was also quite muscular.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a great athlete.</p>
<p>So he went through puberty exceedingly fast.</p>
<p>Other people go through it more slowly.</p>
<p>Some people will go through puberty at age 14,</p>
<p>but they won&rsquo;t start to accumulate facial hair</p>
<p>until much, much later,</p>
<p>or their voice will change first very early,</p>
<p>and then they won&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>the other secondary sexual characteristics until much later.</p>
<p>And so we don&rsquo;t really know how that impacts</p>
<p>or relates to overall trajectory or rate of aging,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an interesting thing to think about</p>
<p>for each and every one of us.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to offer you the opportunity</p>
<p>to do an experiment today while listening to the podcast.</p>
<p>But first I want to tell you a story</p>
<p>about hyenas, professional baseball,</p>
<p>and clitorises, the size of penises.</p>
<p>So when I was a graduate student at UC Berkeley,</p>
<p>we had a professor in our department,</p>
<p>phenomenal scientist named Steve Glickman.</p>
<p>Steve Glickman had a colony of hyenas, spotted hyenas,</p>
<p>that lived within caged enclosures, of course,</p>
<p>in Tilden Park behind the UC Berkeley campus.</p>
<p>The enclosures are actually still there.</p>
<p>I run past there fairly often.</p>
<p>The hyenas are no longer there.</p>
<p>This was a federally funded field station.</p>
<p>These animals were brought over from Africa</p>
<p>or were bred there.</p>
<p>And the reason why there were hyenas in Tilden Park,</p>
<p>enclosed in Tilden Park,</p>
<p>was because hyenas exhibit an incredible feature</p>
<p>to their body, their hormones, and their social structure.</p>
<p>Hyenas, unlike many species,</p>
<p>have a situation with their genitalia</p>
<p>where the male penis is actually smaller</p>
<p>than the female clitoris.</p>
<p>And I should say that the male penis itself,</p>
<p>having seen a fair number of hyena penises,</p>
<p>is not particularly small,</p>
<p>which means that the hyena clitorises are extremely large.</p>
<p>This was well-known for some time.</p>
<p>It turns out that in the spotted hyenas,</p>
<p>the females are dominant.</p>
<p>So after a kill, the females will eat,</p>
<p>then their young will eat,</p>
<p>and then the male hyenas will eat.</p>
<p>As well, when the female hyena gives birth,</p>
<p>she gives birth not through the vaginal canal</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re accustomed to seeing,</p>
<p>but through a very enlarged clitoris-like phallus,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s not a phallus, it&rsquo;s a clitoris,</p>
<p>and it literally splits open.</p>
<p>So many fetuses die</p>
<p>during the course of hyena development and birth.</p>
<p>These animals have this,</p>
<p>what could only be described</p>
<p>as a very large or giant clitoris,</p>
<p>although for a hyena, it&rsquo;s not giant, it&rsquo;s normal.</p>
<p>And it splits open, and the baby actually comes through,</p>
<p>the baby hyena actually comes through the tissue,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a very traumatic birth.</p>
<p>A lot of tissue is torn away, et cetera.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned, a lot of baby hyenas die.</p>
<p>It was a mystery as to how the female hyenas have this,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll call it masculinization,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really a androgenization of the periphery</p>
<p>of the genitalia.</p>
<p>And it turns out through a lot of careful research</p>
<p>done by Steve Glickman, Christine Dre, and others,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s androstenedione,</p>
<p>what is essentially a pro-hormone to testosterone,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s androstenedione at very high levels</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s produced in female hyenas</p>
<p>that creates this enlargement of their genitalia.</p>
<p>So if you want to read up on androstenedione,</p>
<p>androstenedione is made into testosterone</p>
<p>through this enzyme 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complicated pathway to pronounce,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fairly straightforward pathway biochemically.</p>
<p>You may recall during the 90s and 2000s,</p>
<p>there were a lot of performance-enhancing drug scandals,</p>
<p>in particular in Major League Baseball.</p>
<p>And it was purported,</p>
<p>although I don&rsquo;t know that it was ever verified,</p>
<p>but it was purported that the major</p>
<p>performance-enhancing drug of abuse at that time,</p>
<p>in particular players whose names we won&rsquo;t mention,</p>
<p>but you can Google it if you want to find out,</p>
<p>was androstenedione.</p>
<p>And I actually recall long ago</p>
<p>when you could buy androstenedione in the health food stores</p>
<p>and so it was sold over the counter.</p>
<p>So a lot&rsquo;s changed since then,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s interesting that these hyenas</p>
<p>with these highly androgenized genitalia</p>
<p>accomplish that through high levels</p>
<p>of androstenedione in the females.</p>
<p>Now, if that&rsquo;s unusual,</p>
<p>what might be even more unusual</p>
<p>is that a graduate student that I was working with</p>
<p>at the time, alongside, we didn&rsquo;t share research,</p>
<p>her name was Nikola Osipka.</p>
<p>She is actually a trained animal behavioral expert.</p>
<p>She had trained ferrets for that show,</p>
<p>The Beastmaster,</p>
<p>and she would train wolves for television shows</p>
<p>and was a dog trainer.</p>
<p>She had these two large dogs that,</p>
<p>unlike my dog, would actually listen to her</p>
<p>when she would give them commands.</p>
<p>A remarkable scientist.</p>
<p>She was studying a species of mole</p>
<p>that also lived in Tilden Park.</p>
<p>People are gonna start to wonder about Tilden Park.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s in Tilden Park?</p>
<p>But this particular mole that lived there</p>
<p>had testes for part of the year</p>
<p>and had the capacity to transdifferentiate its testes</p>
<p>into ovaries in order to balance out the ratio</p>
<p>of males and females in the population</p>
<p>to keep reproduction at appropriate levels</p>
<p>for that certain population.</p>
<p>So some animals are actually able to adjust</p>
<p>whether or not they have androgenized</p>
<p>or estrogenized gonads</p>
<p>in order to adjust the ratios of offspring</p>
<p>or the males and females and therefore promote offspring.</p>
<p>And the last little anecdote about this,</p>
<p>which is also published in the scientific literature,</p>
<p>which is weird, but I do find interesting.</p>
<p>Hormones are so fascinating.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just incredible to me,</p>
<p>is going back to the marijuana plant.</p>
<p>The marijuana plant has these estrogenic properties.</p>
<p>And I asked a plant biologist</p>
<p>whether or not this was unusual.</p>
<p>And I asked because there&rsquo;s all this stuff out there</p>
<p>about, oh, soy does this,</p>
<p>and these plants are highly estrogenic, et cetera.</p>
<p>Although we should probably point out</p>
<p>that a lot of factory meats are also estrogenic.</p>
<p>So this isn&rsquo;t a meat versus plants thing.</p>
<p>But this plant biologist told me, oh yeah,</p>
<p>there are plants that make</p>
<p>what is essentially the equivalent of testosterone,</p>
<p>like pine pollen, it looks a lot like testosterone.</p>
<p>And there are other plants that make</p>
<p>what is essentially estrogen.</p>
<p>And I said, well, why would they do that?</p>
<p>And plants, at least as far as I know,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a consciousness.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have a brain.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have neurons even.</p>
<p>But his answer was fascinating.</p>
<p>He said that one of the reasons</p>
<p>why some plants have evolved this capacity</p>
<p>to increase estrogen levels in animals that smoke,</p>
<p>not smoke it, but then animals that consume them,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that animals aren&rsquo;t smoking marijuana,</p>
<p>although, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>send me the paper if you&rsquo;ve heard of this,</p>
<p>is that plants have figured out ways,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve adapted ways to push back on populations</p>
<p>of rodents and other species of animals that eat them.</p>
<p>So plants are engaged in a kind of plant to animal warfare</p>
<p>where they increase the estrogen</p>
<p>of the males in that population to lower the sperm counts</p>
<p>to keep those populations clamped at certain levels</p>
<p>so that those plants can continue to flourish</p>
<p>even if those animals are reproducing very robustly.</p>
<p>And I find this just fascinating.</p>
<p>And hormones, therefore, aren&rsquo;t just impacting tissue growth</p>
<p>and development within the individual</p>
<p>and between the mother.</p>
<p>Remember, the placenta is an endocrine organ</p>
<p>and the offspring,</p>
<p>but plants and animals are in this communication.</p>
<p>And today we&rsquo;re in this communication.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you that there are certain herbicides</p>
<p>that humans are using for which there&rsquo;s very good data</p>
<p>are disrupting the endocrine pathways.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s fascinating that humans and other animals</p>
<p>were always in this interplay with plants</p>
<p>and the other things in our environment.</p>
<p>And hormones and adjusting the hormone levels</p>
<p>of animals and plants is one way</p>
<p>in which the environment kind of pushes back</p>
<p>or pushes forward, if you will,</p>
<p>in terms of promoting their wellbeing and longevity,</p>
<p>as well as you trying to promote</p>
<p>your wellbeing and longevity.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to see the incredible paper</p>
<p>by Steve Glickman and colleagues,</p>
<p>it was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy</p>
<p>first in 1987.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Glickman et al.</p>
<p>That was the hypothesis that it was androstenedione.</p>
<p>And then if you just Google</p>
<p>Glickman Hyenas Science Magazine,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a beautiful cover article</p>
<p>and feature all about that important discovery.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating one.</p>
<p>And I should mention also that those discoveries,</p>
<p>both the moles and the hyenas,</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t just impactful for the world of animal behavior</p>
<p>and endocrinology.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve also strongly impacted understanding</p>
<p>of conditions that show up in the clinic,</p>
<p>which we haven&rsquo;t talked about today,</p>
<p>which is actually pseudo hermaphroditism.</p>
<p>Occasionally babies will be born where it is unclear</p>
<p>if they are boys or girls based on the genitalia.</p>
<p>And this has a very important ethical and other issues.</p>
<p>Do you raise them as a boy or a girl?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not super uncommon for this to happen.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;ve been terrible cases</p>
<p>where people have gone against the chromosomal sex</p>
<p>and the person was very unhappy with the choice</p>
<p>that their parents had made for them.</p>
<p>There were also cases where they&rsquo;ve gone</p>
<p>with the chromosomal sex and the person was very happy</p>
<p>about the outcome.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ve been cases where they&rsquo;ve been treated with hormones</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;ve been cases</p>
<p>where they have not been treated with hormones.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complicated literature</p>
<p>and it has to be sorted out on kind of a case-by-case basis,</p>
<p>but it is something that does happen.</p>
<p>And the studies on androstenedione in hyenas</p>
<p>and in these very interesting moles,</p>
<p>pseudo hermaphroditic moles that live in Tilden Park</p>
<p>have impacted not just the science,</p>
<p>but the therapeutics around those important issues.</p>
<p>So now last but not least,</p>
<p>I want to discuss the effects of hormones</p>
<p>while you and I were separately in utero</p>
<p>and the effects that that had on who we are,</p>
<p>who we select as mates, so mate choice, sexual preference,</p>
<p>and all other aspects</p>
<p>of what you would call sexual development.</p>
<p>Now, this is something that&rsquo;s gotten a lot of popular press</p>
<p>and it has to do with how exposure to androgens</p>
<p>in particular while we were in utero</p>
<p>impacted whether or not people report as homosexual,</p>
<p>heterosexual, identify as male or female.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very familiar with this work</p>
<p>because I was a graduate student in the department</p>
<p>that first published this work</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m an author on the paper.</p>
<p>I was not the main driver of the work,</p>
<p>but I was involved in the work</p>
<p>and I certainly know the people that did this work.</p>
<p>First, it starts with a story.</p>
<p>There was a researcher who&rsquo;s still going now.</p>
<p>His name is Dennis McFadden.</p>
<p>I believe he was at UT Austin back then</p>
<p>and he was studying the auditory system</p>
<p>and people would come into his clinic or his laboratory</p>
<p>and he would look at hearing</p>
<p>and he would explore different aspects</p>
<p>of what they call the psychophysics of hearing</p>
<p>and understanding hearing thresholds</p>
<p>and frequency thresholds.</p>
<p>And he made several observations</p>
<p>and those observations were</p>
<p>that young males</p>
<p>tended to have what are called autoacoustic emissions</p>
<p>more often than young females did.</p>
<p>Autoacoustic emissions, as the name suggests,</p>
<p>are the ears actually making sounds.</p>
<p>Now these sounds have to be picked up by a special apparatus</p>
<p>because they can hear into that frequency,</p>
<p>but it turns out that your ears</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t just take sound waves</p>
<p>and convert them into this thing we call hearing,</p>
<p>but they also, in some cases, make sounds.</p>
<p>So your ears are making sounds.</p>
<p>Strange, right?</p>
<p>So it turns out that there&rsquo;s a sex difference</p>
<p>in autoacoustic emissions.</p>
<p>Turns out also that people that self-report as lesbians,</p>
<p>they also have autoacoustic emissions</p>
<p>significantly more than females</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t self-report as lesbian.</p>
<p>And Dennis noticed this and published this</p>
<p>and it was an important discovery</p>
<p>because it was one of the first discoveries</p>
<p>that pointed to the fact that there are sex differences</p>
<p>in biology that are independent of sex.</p>
<p>I mean, this is hearing in autoacoustic emissions.</p>
<p>And just to really illustrate what the former problem was</p>
<p>and why this study was so important,</p>
<p>a lot of people had explored, for instance,</p>
<p>whether or not homosexuals had lower testosterone,</p>
<p>for instance, in males.</p>
<p>And actually the result often was the opposite,</p>
<p>that gay men or men that self-report as gay</p>
<p>often had much higher testosterone.</p>
<p>And those studies then became controversial</p>
<p>because people said,</p>
<p>well, sexual behavior can relate to testosterone, et cetera.</p>
<p>And so it became very controversial.</p>
<p>And then there were some studies</p>
<p>that attempted to look at the equivalent phenomenon</p>
<p>in people that self-report as lesbian</p>
<p>or self-report as heterosexual.</p>
<p>And so it became very complicated.</p>
<p>But this was an identification of a phenomenon,</p>
<p>autoacoustic emissions,</p>
<p>that was independent of anything that had to do</p>
<p>with sexual or even social behavior.</p>
<p>1998 rolls around and I&rsquo;m a graduate student at UC Berkeley</p>
<p>and a guy by the name of Mark Breedlove,</p>
<p>kind of an ironic name,</p>
<p>given that he worked and still works on sexual dimorphism</p>
<p>in the brain and in the spinal cord and nervous system.</p>
<p>And Mark, who&rsquo;s a phenomenal scientist,</p>
<p>comes running down the hall, I&rsquo;ll never forget this.</p>
<p>And he said, give me your hands.</p>
<p>I was like, give me your hands.</p>
<p>And he pulls out a ruler</p>
<p>and he starts measuring my fingers</p>
<p>and he takes down a couple of measurements</p>
<p>and then he goes away.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, what was that?</p>
<p>Well, I was in a course that Mark was teaching</p>
<p>at that point.</p>
<p>And soon after, we did a study that Mark directed</p>
<p>exploring the finger length ratios,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll explain what those are,</p>
<p>of males and females</p>
<p>and people that self-reported</p>
<p>as homosexual or heterosexual.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just get to the basic,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;ll call sex differences first.</p>
<p>These are averages.</p>
<p>I want to point out,</p>
<p>anytime you get into this kind of topic,</p>
<p>people assume it&rsquo;s causal, but it&rsquo;s not causal.</p>
<p>These are averages that I&rsquo;m about to report.</p>
<p>It is the case that the ratio</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s called the D2 to D4 digits.</p>
<p>So the D2 is your index finger.</p>
<p>So your thumb is D1,</p>
<p>then D2 would be your index finger</p>
<p>that you would point with.</p>
<p>Middle finger is D3, which you whatever with.</p>
<p>And then D4 is the so-called ring finger.</p>
<p>Okay, and D5 is the pinky.</p>
<p>It is the case that the D2 to D4 ratio</p>
<p>is greater in self-reported females than it is in males.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>It means that digit D2 and D4 are more similar in length</p>
<p>in females than in males.</p>
<p>And the effect is particularly, excuse me,</p>
<p>pronounced on the right hand, although not always, okay?</p>
<p>And it does not have to do with handedness.</p>
<p>This D2 to D4 difference has to be measured correctly.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just look at somebody&rsquo;s hands and say,</p>
<p>oh, you know, their ring finger and index finger</p>
<p>are very similar, and therefore they are female in,</p>
<p>you know, or they were exposed</p>
<p>to very little testosterone in utero.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t look at somebody</p>
<p>and see that their index finger is much shorter</p>
<p>than their ring finger and say, oh, you know,</p>
<p>they must&rsquo;ve been exposed to a lot of androgen.</p>
<p>You have to actually measure it,</p>
<p>and you have to measure it correctly.</p>
<p>You have to measure it from the base of the finger</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s that first crease all the way to the tip,</p>
<p>past the, you can&rsquo;t include the fingernails</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re growing fingernails.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be logical here, folks.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t normally see it from the back of the hand.</p>
<p>Although, I don&rsquo;t know if this&rsquo;ll show up here,</p>
<p>but if you look at the back of the hand,</p>
<p>sometimes you can see it.</p>
<p>You know, in my case, for instance,</p>
<p>let me see if I can do this.</p>
<p>So my D4 is a little bit longer than my D2.</p>
<p>In some people, it&rsquo;s more pronounced,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s on my right hand.</p>
<p>On the other hand,</p>
<p>the difference actually is far less pronounced.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit pronounced there, but not so much, okay?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s sort of the typical ratio that you would see.</p>
<p>Turns out that in mice and in humans,</p>
<p>the more androgen that you were exposed to in utero,</p>
<p>the smaller the D4, D2 ratio,</p>
<p>meaning that the ring finger tends to be slightly longer</p>
<p>than the pointer finger.</p>
<p>And in females, because they&rsquo;re exposed to less androgen</p>
<p>in utero, typically,</p>
<p>then those fingers tend to be more equal in length.</p>
<p>And these are subtle differences, and these are averages.</p>
<p>I invite you to look up the paper.</p>
<p>This was published in Nature in 2000,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been replicated six times.</p>
<p>Now, here&rsquo;s where it gets even more interesting</p>
<p>and potentially precarious.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to step cautiously here.</p>
<p>If you look at the finger length ratios</p>
<p>of men that self-report as homosexual,</p>
<p>they have either the typical male pattern</p>
<p>of D2 to D4 ratio,</p>
<p>or a hyper-masculinized D4 to D2 ratio.</p>
<p>Now, this can&rsquo;t be something that&rsquo;s established</p>
<p>or modified by behavior.</p>
<p>This has to be something that was established in utero.</p>
<p>And in fact, it&rsquo;s present at birth, okay?</p>
<p>So it completely divorces the interactions</p>
<p>between hormones and behavior.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an important theme that we&rsquo;ve been talking about,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to talk about even more next episode,</p>
<p>is that hormones impact behavior,</p>
<p>but behavior also impact hormones.</p>
<p>But this is a case of hormones impacting</p>
<p>what really should be considered</p>
<p>a primary sexual characteristic,</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t show up in puberty.</p>
<p>It shows up before puberty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually established in utero.</p>
<p>And in people that self-reported lesbians,</p>
<p>and I remember going out there and collecting these data</p>
<p>with the collaborators on this work.</p>
<p>Again, I wasn&rsquo;t the main driver on the work,</p>
<p>but I participated in some of the analysis.</p>
<p>People that self-report as lesbians</p>
<p>also tend to have a smaller D2 to D4 ratio.</p>
<p>So this is consistent with the autoacoustic emission study</p>
<p>that Dennis McFadden had published.</p>
<p>And it points to the fact that early exposure to androgens</p>
<p>may have an impact,</p>
<p>not just on androgenization of the body plan,</p>
<p>but also separately on sexual preference.</p>
<p>Now, this raises all sorts of interesting questions</p>
<p>about biological basis of sexual preference.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you about another study,</p>
<p>a guy named Simon LeVay, who was at UCLA,</p>
<p>who trained under Hubel and Wiesel.</p>
<p>If any of you remember early episodes on plasticity,</p>
<p>David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel,</p>
<p>my scientific great-grandparents,</p>
<p>won the Nobel Prize for discovery</p>
<p>of critical periods for brain plasticity.</p>
<p>They defined some of the most important aspects</p>
<p>of how we see and brain plasticity.</p>
<p>Simon LeVay trained with them.</p>
<p>And then Simon went on to discover</p>
<p>that in the brains of people that self-report homosexual,</p>
<p>there is a brain difference.</p>
<p>And the brain differences in an area</p>
<p>called the interstitial nucleus</p>
<p>of the anterior hypothalamus.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the I-N-A-H.</p>
<p>And so there are published reports</p>
<p>that was published in Science.</p>
<p>The other work I refer to as published in Nature,</p>
<p>and then replicated no fewer than six times,</p>
<p>and the McFadden results that point</p>
<p>to strong biological correlates</p>
<p>of mate choice, of sexual preference.</p>
<p>And these tie directly to things</p>
<p>like androgenization or estrogenization,</p>
<p>meaning we could call it maleness or femaleness,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s sort of tricky territory</p>
<p>because of the way that we described the huge range</p>
<p>in which sex can be defined earlier.</p>
<p>So if you want to measure D2, D4 ratio, you&rsquo;re welcome to,</p>
<p>but you also have to understand</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not predictive of anything, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a window into the possible androgen exposure</p>
<p>that you had early in life.</p>
<p>There are plenty of men who report themselves</p>
<p>as heterosexual who are out there,</p>
<p>who have similar or have D2, D4 ratios to females.</p>
<p>And there are plenty of females whose index fingers</p>
<p>are shorter than their ring fingers,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re perfectly happy,</p>
<p>or they say they&rsquo;re perfectly happy,</p>
<p>and we are inclined to believe them being heterosexual.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s variation.</p>
<p>In fact, Mark tells a really good joke.</p>
<p>If you want to know whether or not somebody is homosexual</p>
<p>or heterosexual, simply look at their hands,</p>
<p>look at their D2, D4 ratio, and guess heterosexual,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll be right 96% of the time.</p>
<p>Because 96% of the time,</p>
<p>people report themselves as heterosexual on average.</p>
<p>Those numbers might be changing.</p>
<p>So the joke really is a joke on science</p>
<p>because that falls within the realm</p>
<p>of statistical significance,</p>
<p>and yet it really illustrates the fact</p>
<p>that none of this is causal.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s nonetheless very interesting</p>
<p>because it means that hormones are organizing</p>
<p>the brain early in development</p>
<p>in ways that can potentially impact</p>
<p>same or opposite sex partner choice later in life.</p>
<p>Now, of course, there are other things</p>
<p>that can impact opposite sex</p>
<p>or same sex partner choice later in life.</p>
<p>The study did not look at people who reported bisexual.</p>
<p>There hasn&rsquo;t been a lot of studies on that yet.</p>
<p>One thing that&rsquo;s very interesting,</p>
<p>for which there are some good scientific data,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also some controversy,</p>
<p>is that it appears that the probability</p>
<p>of a male human self-reporting as homosexual</p>
<p>increases with the number of older brothers that he has.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn&rsquo;t mean if you have an older brother,</p>
<p>even if you have 10 older brothers,</p>
<p>that you are sure to self-report as homosexual.</p>
<p>But statistically, it becomes more likely</p>
<p>that somebody will with each successive older brother</p>
<p>that they have.</p>
<p>And the idea that&rsquo;s starting to emerge</p>
<p>in the developmental neuroendocrinology landscape</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a record within the mother</p>
<p>of how many male fetuses she&rsquo;s carried,</p>
<p>because male fetuses are secreting certain things,</p>
<p>dihydrotestosterone, other things,</p>
<p>that can feed back onto the genome,</p>
<p>so these could be epigenomic effects,</p>
<p>or onto the placenta itself,</p>
<p>so that there&rsquo;s a higher probability</p>
<p>in subsequent pregnancies</p>
<p>that offspring will self-report as homosexual.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a fascinating area of biology.</p>
<p>And as you&rsquo;ve noticed today,</p>
<p>none of this deals with the current controversies</p>
<p>around gender, and how many genders, and sex, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a separate conversation that is, by definition,</p>
<p>grounded in the kind of concepts</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking about today,</p>
<p>and needs to take place,</p>
<p>taking into consideration all of the aspects of sex</p>
<p>and the effects of hormones,</p>
<p>both on the body, on the brain.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t talk a lot about spinal cord,</p>
<p>but we will in the next episode,</p>
<p>but we can just say on the brain and the periphery,</p>
<p>early effects, late effects,</p>
<p>acute effects, meaning effects that are very fast,</p>
<p>of levels of hormones going up or down,</p>
<p>something that absolutely happens</p>
<p>during and across the menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>as well as long-term effects,</p>
<p>like the effects of these hormones on gene expression.</p>
<p>So today, as always,</p>
<p>we weren&rsquo;t able to cover all things related</p>
<p>to sex, and hormones, and sexual differentiation,</p>
<p>or development.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way we could,</p>
<p>but we have covered a lot of material.</p>
<p>We talked about some effects of environmental toxins.</p>
<p>We talked about potential effects of cell phone radiation,</p>
<p>something I never thought that I would be talking about,</p>
<p>especially not in a podcast,</p>
<p>but for which there are interesting emerging data.</p>
<p>We talked about considerations about evening primrose oil,</p>
<p>and its estrogenic effects,</p>
<p>about creatine and its pro-DHT effects,</p>
<p>about cannabis, alcohol,</p>
<p>about plants exerting warfare on animals</p>
<p>by increasing aromatase,</p>
<p>the conversion of testosterone to estrogen.</p>
<p>We talked about hyenas with giant clitorises,</p>
<p>and we talked about moles</p>
<p>that can convert from having ovaries to testicles.</p>
<p>And throughout this, Costello has been snoring nonstop.</p>
<p>He missed all of it,</p>
<p>although he might be learning it in his sleep,</p>
<p>for all I know.</p>
<p>And I do understand it&rsquo;s a lot of information,</p>
<p>a lot of detail.</p>
<p>As always, I just want to remind you,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to absorb all the information at once.</p>
<p>Next episode, we are going to be talking about</p>
<p>the science of sex, the verb, actual reproduction.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also going to be talking about effects of hormones</p>
<p>on various aspects of behavior</p>
<p>and ways to modulate hormones</p>
<p>through the use of behavior, supplementation.</p>
<p>Also, we&rsquo;ll touch on diet and nutrition a bit,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to talk about interactions</p>
<p>between those things and behavior</p>
<p>as they relate to important themes,</p>
<p>like sex and reproduction, like workplace performance,</p>
<p>like motivation and drive, and even anxiety.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very interesting relationship</p>
<p>between hormones and anxiety</p>
<p>and the desire to explore novelty.</p>
<p>So just remember as we go forward</p>
<p>that hormones affect behavior and behavior affects hormones,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that cutting off your index finger</p>
<p>will increase your testosterone.</p>
