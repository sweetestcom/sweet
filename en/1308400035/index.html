    <p>hi friends I&rsquo;m in a happy mood today like I&rsquo;m a happy fucking dick right now</p>
<p>so here I am to talk my shit and I&rsquo;m gonna tell you all the things you need</p>
<p>to know about drinking alcohol these are my requirements these are my rules bitch</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s so much more that goes into drinking then you realize and I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>tell you all the shit you need to know because the main thing you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>do is feel like ass the next day like you don&rsquo;t want to feel like hell so</p>
<p>these are all of my tips to help you one not gain weight from drinking that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>coming at the end though and then to how to not feel like shit like how to not be</p>
<p>hungover how to beat it okay and also I&rsquo;m gonna tell you a couple little tips</p>
<p>and little tricks to take care of your body some do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts you know cuz</p>
<p>we want to take care of that liver I really wish I could say just kidding but</p>
<p>this is all the shit that I wish someone would have told me like I saw I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna tell y&rsquo;all y&rsquo;all my friends and I&rsquo;m gonna give it to you straight so</p>
<p>first thing I want to talk about is like the main things for beating a</p>
<p>hangover that you can do when it comes to sleep because that&rsquo;s the main reason</p>
<p>you feel like fucking hell the day after drinking alcohol is because your quality</p>
<p>of sleep is so bad like alcohol will fuck with it but there&rsquo;s so many other</p>
<p>things that ruin your quality of sleep so I&rsquo;m gonna hit on a couple of things</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m gonna give you tips about actually drinking what to do and then</p>
<p>what to do the next day okay so first things first let&rsquo;s talk about sleep a</p>
<p>lot of people don&rsquo;t know you have to stop drinking three hours before you go</p>
<p>to bed I like to say like two to three cuz bitch you know when it&rsquo;s just real</p>
<p>late and you just want like a little extra shot like don&rsquo;t take it okay don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fucking take it stop drinking at least two hours before you&rsquo;re gonna go to bed</p>
<p>put the shot down put the drink down toss it out and switch it for some water</p>
<p>babe it takes around two hours for your liver to get rid of and filter out one</p>
<p>drink or one shot so your livers already be working overtime bitch cuz we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>drinking a whole bunch we&rsquo;re drinking to get drunk you&rsquo;re gonna be processing all</p>
<p>night but you don&rsquo;t want alcohol still like in your system it&rsquo;s gonna be in</p>
<p>your system but you don&rsquo;t want your liver filtering out the most of it like</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re still trying to go to bed cuz it&rsquo;s not gonna you&rsquo;re not gonna</p>
<p>sleep good you&rsquo;re gonna sleep like ass and then you&rsquo;re gonna feel like ass the</p>
<p>next day so next thing is no caffeine after 2 p.m. oh my god Leo how the fuck</p>
<p>could you say that like you really shouldn&rsquo;t be drinking caffeine past 2</p>
<p>p.m. on any fucking day because it ruins your sleep so the half-life of caffeine</p>
<p>is 5 hours so that means caffeine is in your system for 10 hours so if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to go to sleep and you still have caffeine active in your system guess what</p>
<p>bitch 2 &amp; 2 is 4 you&rsquo;re not gonna fucking sleep good so try to limit</p>
<p>caffeine you could drink it after like 3 p.m. 4 p.m. fine but like you best go to</p>
<p>bed late so that&rsquo;s just a really really big tip is no caffeine cuz I love you</p>
<p>just pop a 5-hour energy or like a lot of bitches drink like espresso martinis</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never had one I will let you know how they are once I do try one but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll never catch me at night drinking one because I want to go to sleep and I</p>
<p>want to sleep great because I have shit to do the next day like every time I</p>
<p>drink I have things to do like I&rsquo;m busy now like I don&rsquo;t have a day to just like</p>
<p>fuck off so these are my things that like keep me in check so next we know we</p>
<p>want to stay away from the stimulants and that also means no coke bitch</p>
<p>fucking put the coke down sorry like I know a lot of people don&rsquo;t like to talk</p>
<p>about that but it&rsquo;s so prevalent in the going-out scene stop shoving shit in</p>
<p>your nose okay I know it&rsquo;s fun Z&rsquo;s I know you&rsquo;re like oh my god it&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just do a little bad but a couple bad it&rsquo;s like no you&rsquo;re gonna sleep like</p>
<p>ass the next day like if you&rsquo;re gonna go out and party and drink and have fun</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t fuck yourself up okay like unless you&rsquo;re on vacation and you have like</p>
<p>free time go ape shit okay go have fun be safe god damn it but like go have fun</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re on a vacation but like don&rsquo;t go out like downtown in your city and be</p>
<p>doing coke that&rsquo;s not cute don&rsquo;t do that it&rsquo;s not worth it the next day you know</p>
<p>what I mean but you&rsquo;re gonna be chemically imbalanced one but two you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna sleep like ass so no blow keep that fucking shit away from you okay</p>
<p>next thing we&rsquo;re gonna talk about is nicotine and a lot of people be talking</p>
<p>shit on the fact that I like to have a little cigarette here and there until</p>
<p>they get some alcohol in them and then it&rsquo;s oh can I hit it can I take a drag</p>
<p>oh funny how the tables turn how can I hit that vape well bitch weren&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>just talking shit on me for having a vape and now you want to hit it look at</p>
<p>you cook it out I see you but yeah nicotine is a good stimulant good bitch</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t let me say it&rsquo;s a good stimulant don&rsquo;t listen to me if you are under 21</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t listen to this episode nicotine is a stimulant but it&rsquo;s not gonna fuck</p>
<p>your shit up that bad so I&rsquo;d say cut that shit out like two hours before</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna go to bed I want to say three to four hours but let&rsquo;s be</p>
<p>realistic okay just fucking stop hitting your vape like as soon as you can before</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna go to sleep and just trust me on that one cuz it is a stimulant</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like as bad as caffeine where it&rsquo;s gonna like keep you up and fuck</p>
<p>with your sleep but it still will fuck with your sleep a little bit but I know</p>
<p>sometimes when you&rsquo;re trying to get ready to go out or you&rsquo;re like on the</p>
<p>way you&rsquo;re feeling a little tired you want something to like a pick-me-up but</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to do no caffeine you need something so like I can&rsquo;t take</p>
<p>everything away from you all right like I&rsquo;ll give you at least a little fucking</p>
<p>vape all right fine I&rsquo;m not talking to you personally this is just how I talk</p>
<p>to myself like I baby myself I&rsquo;m like okay all right fine you whiny ass you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>tired hit your little vape here you can have that like I have to give myself</p>
<p>things to keep me going cuz like if I can&rsquo;t have a five-hour energy then you</p>
<p>think I&rsquo;m just gonna raw dog it that&rsquo;s a little difficult like unless there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really really good song on or you&rsquo;re with really fun people that&rsquo;ll like get</p>
<p>you boosted back up but I totally get it but those are my tips on stimulants so</p>
<p>now let&rsquo;s move into drinks and the first thing I&rsquo;m gonna say is sugar stay the</p>
<p>fuck away from it it is gonna make you hung over as a bitch anything with</p>
<p>sugar in it don&rsquo;t do it oh my god okay I can&rsquo;t explain to you how much that</p>
<p>will fuck you up like anything with sugar in it you have to watch out for so</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna do sodas do diet sodas if you&rsquo;re gonna do mixers don&rsquo;t add</p>
<p>anything with fucking sugar diet soda is fine grow up and just drink it I know a</p>
<p>lot of people that drink regular soda like diet doesn&rsquo;t taste this good bitch</p>
<p>shut up and just drink the fucking liquor do you want to be hung over or</p>
<p>not okay great so listen the good thing about diet sodas I don&rsquo;t want to say</p>
<p>the good thing cuz y&rsquo;all are gonna misconstrue everything I fucking say but</p>
<p>the thing that I like about diet sodas is aspartame makes you drunker faster</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s scientifically proven like I posted a tick-tock saying that a while</p>
<p>ago and people were like no the fuck it doesn&rsquo;t shut up you&rsquo;re a liar and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like you dumb shit fucking pull up Google and it will be right there in</p>
<p>front of your face there&rsquo;s plenty of studies that have been done that prove</p>
<p>that aspartame makes you drunker faster so just shut up and just drink the</p>
<p>fucking diet soda okay but my main point with all this is stay away from sugar</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t drink anything with sugar in it if you&rsquo;re gonna get a margarita say a</p>
<p>skinny margarita so they don&rsquo;t put the agave and the extra fucking shitty near</p>
<p>all right but just switch to diet trust me on that just trust me on it and stay</p>
<p>away from any sugary shots so like a green seat a white seat a lemon drop a</p>
<p>fucking what is the blue one what&rsquo;s the blue like the snicker not snickerdoodle</p>
<p>dumbass the pixie sick shot oh my god those are so fucking good but don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>drink them don&rsquo;t drink anything with sugar I&rsquo;m telling you I know how hard it</p>
<p>is to have to be the picky one of the friend group but trust me when you wake</p>
<p>up in the morning you&rsquo;re gonna thank God oh you&rsquo;re really gonna thank me for not</p>
<p>letting you drink the sugary shit like when I go to the bar everyone&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>what do you want and I&rsquo;m like shot of tequila I don&rsquo;t like a drink we know</p>
<p>that but I don&rsquo;t like a lot of liquid cuz I don&rsquo;t want to have to fucking pee</p>
<p>but also like I don&rsquo;t want sugar I don&rsquo;t want mixers I don&rsquo;t want anything that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna make me more hungover than I&rsquo;m already gonna be so just remember me</p>
<p>saying no sugar okay stay the fuck away from it like the plague another little</p>
<p>tip that a lot of people talk about is drink a glass of water between each</p>
<p>drink or shot but for me personally that&rsquo;s too goddamn much every other shot</p>
<p>every other drink I&rsquo;ll have some water I feel like that&rsquo;s more feasible because</p>
<p>like I said I don&rsquo;t like to have to pee while I&rsquo;m out cuz like once you break</p>
<p>the seal you&rsquo;re fucked you know so I try to keep my liquid intake low I&rsquo;d never</p>
<p>just take a shot take it to the face and like keep walking I don&rsquo;t need a fucking</p>
<p>like whole drink I&rsquo;m grown I can handle a shot you know my little tip for not</p>
<p>getting too drunk too fast or not getting too drunk is get drinks that</p>
<p>taste like shit and I&rsquo;m talking like a tequila soda lime that&rsquo;s my go-to but I</p>
<p>weirdly I&rsquo;m getting a taste for it but get drinks that are not easy to drink</p>
<p>because if I have something that tastes good it&rsquo;s gone in three seconds like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gulping the shit I can&rsquo;t handle something like that like I can&rsquo;t handle</p>
<p>things that taste good I&rsquo;m gonna finish them so you want a drink that&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>bite you back like when you drink it or sip it it&rsquo;s gonna make you make that</p>
<p>fucking face of like yeah you want that you want that so you drink it real slow</p>
<p>okay and you will get your money&rsquo;s worth and you&rsquo;ll be able to taste that you get</p>
<p>your money&rsquo;s worth of like I taste that fucking liquor it&rsquo;s there cuz I hate</p>
<p>when you get a drink and you&rsquo;re like where&rsquo;s the fucking alcohol I hate</p>
<p>drinks like that like if I have to question if there&rsquo;s alcohol and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>the drink for me like I like that shit to hit me in the face and also that will</p>
<p>help you stay away from sugar but also this is the biggest tip I have for</p>
<p>anybody that&rsquo;s gonna drink like a soda drink do not ever fucking order tonic</p>
<p>water tonic water has sugar in it it tastes the same as club soda but it has</p>
<p>sugar and calories in it bitch I thought for so long I was so healthy being like</p>
<p>oh can I get a tequila tonic and I thought I was like doing something like</p>
<p>oh I&rsquo;m so skinny bitch no I&rsquo;m a fat ass I&rsquo;m fucking over here drinking a cup of</p>
<p>sugar like I just thought cuz it tasted bad that it was healthy no you have to</p>
<p>watch out do not drink tonic water always soda always club soda always soda</p>
<p>water never tonic if you ever take anything away from this take that</p>
<p>because the night that I was drinking my drink and one of my friends was like oh</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s sugar and tonic water right I said shut the fuck up I said</p>
<p>shut your mouth and you&rsquo;re talking to me what the fuck did you just say and I</p>
<p>literally googled it and I was like traumatized and I put my drink down and</p>
<p>never ordered it again so I&rsquo;m here to share like learn from my mistake my</p>
<p>headass mistake of ordering tonic water and don&rsquo;t okay so when it comes to</p>
<p>liquor stick with one okay pick and stick for the night so I only drink</p>
<p>tequila but there&rsquo;s some nights where I will like if someone comes up to me and</p>
<p>like tries to pour a shot in my mouth like cuz they bought a bottle I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>okay and it&rsquo;s vodka I&rsquo;ve noticed when I mix liquors I&rsquo;m hungover as fuck the</p>
<p>next day and also when I have vodka I want to fight tequila makes me horny a</p>
<p>little bit and it makes me want to dance and have fun like I just have a good</p>
<p>time on tequila she&rsquo;s my friend she tastes good she&rsquo;s an activity to do a</p>
<p>tequila shot it&rsquo;s like con limonisa like you have it with some fucking lime it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cutesy it&rsquo;s fun but vodka like that&rsquo;s not an event like you just take a shot</p>
<p>of vodka there&rsquo;s no nothing to go with it like it&rsquo;s not dressed it&rsquo;s not cute</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like a shot of shit to your face but not me judging vodka drinkers</p>
<p>okay anyway I&rsquo;ve noticed when I mix liquors I feel more like fucked up the</p>
<p>next day so just pick one and stick with it so if you&rsquo;re gonna do tequila stick</p>
<p>with tequila if you&rsquo;re gonna do vodka stick with vodka if you&rsquo;re gonna do</p>
<p>whiskey stick with whiskey if someone drinks whiskey red flag I&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about this and my red flags podcast episode but what the fuck happened to</p>
<p>you as a child that you prefer whiskey that&rsquo;s your drink of choice what the</p>
<p>fuck I will say when I drink tequila and I mix it with beer like I don&rsquo;t mix</p>
<p>them together but like if I drink a shot of tequila and then I drink a beer and</p>
<p>then I have some shots and have some beers like I have an iron stomach I can</p>
<p>handle that shit but a lot of people are pussies and they&rsquo;ll be like throwing up</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll be like all upset and crying and like sick I can&rsquo;t relate so a lot of</p>
<p>people will say to stay away from mixing beer with liquor there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>sayings of like liquor before beer you&rsquo;re in the clear beer before liquor</p>
<p>and never been sicker like there&rsquo;s sayings like that but like I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>believe that shit it&rsquo;s all going to the same spot so what does it matter who you</p>
<p>did first you don&rsquo;t I mean whatever I don&rsquo;t mind it I can handle it but a lot</p>
<p>of people will say it makes you more hungover and feel like hell if you mix</p>
<p>liquor and beer so just stay away from that if and try it and see if it works</p>
<p>but one thing I will throw in one thing I couldn&rsquo;t handle yo one time me and a</p>
<p>friend drank shots of tequila then we had some beers you know like it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just kind of how it goes and then this bitch pulls out wine and we drank two</p>
<p>bottles of wine and I have never been more sick wanting to die like you know</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re on the toilet and you&rsquo;re like pulling your hair because your</p>
<p>stomach is cramping so bad that&rsquo;s the type of sick I was okay so that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing I will never recommend is wine tequila and beer do not do that to</p>
<p>yourself honestly I don&rsquo;t like wine I&rsquo;m not a</p>
<p>wine person I&rsquo;ll drink it if it&rsquo;s there but I just don&rsquo;t get it like I maybe I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>too young to understand wine right now but it&rsquo;s just not for me like I&rsquo;m just I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like I I&rsquo;m okay I&rsquo;m fine like I&rsquo;ll just have a shot don&rsquo;t mind me okay so</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re gonna talk about the quality of alcohol do not ever in your fucking</p>
<p>life drink Jose Cuervo if you&rsquo;re gonna drink tequila do not ever drink Jose</p>
<p>Cuervo I will say that until the day I die it is not a hundred percent blue</p>
<p>agave like you want tequilas that are a hundred percent Jose Cuervo is some</p>
<p>other shit okay that&rsquo;s why you feel like hell after you drink it and just in</p>
<p>general buy the little bit nicer bottle like I understand and I know like you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to pay for it but your body will like your body doesn&rsquo;t want to have</p>
<p>to pay for the cheap shit so like just get the nicer bottle you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>get the one that&rsquo;s like 50 60 bucks but like step it up a little get a liquor</p>
<p>that is not bottom shelf like just do that for your body be nice to your body</p>
<p>money will come and go okay pregame in the fucking car off the bottle you bought</p>
<p>because you can go buy a bottle of fucking liquor for 30 bucks that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>not the worst shit in the world and you can pregame with it and have fun on it</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s cute or you can go to the club and get two fucking drinks and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s your 30 bucks you know like you can get a bottle or two drinks be smart</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my version of couponing so just take notes from me I&rsquo;m able to buy</p>
<p>expensive shit because I know where to penny pinch okay okay so my next one is a</p>
<p>little weird tip but a lot of people don&rsquo;t know it you have a three-hour</p>
<p>window to get alcohol in you because after three hours your body prioritizes</p>
<p>sobering up so when you start drinking you start having those euphoric effects</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re cutesy it&rsquo;s fun it&rsquo;s like yay it&rsquo;s go go go and then all of a sudden</p>
<p>you start feeling fucking tired after a few hours that&rsquo;s because your body&rsquo;s</p>
<p>prioritizing sobering up you have about three hours to get the alcohol in you</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re gonna start sobering up so if you drink after that it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna hit like it would before it will still hit but like it&rsquo;s not gonna be as</p>
<p>euphoric and funsy as if you took it within three hours and it&rsquo;s not gonna</p>
<p>make the tired go away once it hits if you keep drinking you&rsquo;re just gonna keep</p>
<p>getting more tired you&rsquo;re just gonna get a lot more like dizzy but that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>something to keep in mind so remember me saying that like you got three hours to</p>
<p>get that shit in you and then start drinking water to like help your body</p>
<p>start sobering up because it&rsquo;s gonna do it regardless okay so now let&rsquo;s get into</p>
<p>other random little tips you need to know a couple of them are diet related</p>
<p>so you need to understand each shot of alcohol is around a hundred calories and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just straight liquor so if you get a drink and you just get soda water</p>
<p>and a shot of tequila that drink is a hundred calories if you get a tequila in</p>
<p>Sprite it&rsquo;s most likely 200 calories because there&rsquo;s real Sprite in it now so</p>
<p>the calories will stack a lot of people don&rsquo;t understand how calorie dense</p>
<p>alcohol is so watch your ass with that so just keep that in mind that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>important to know is each shot is around 100 calories some alcohol might be more</p>
<p>tequila has the least amount of calories though so that&rsquo;s just something to keep</p>
<p>in mind depending on the drinks that you get or the shots that you order if you</p>
<p>order a shot with something sugary mixed in it it&rsquo;s like calorie overload so it</p>
<p>will fuck your diet up okay so since we&rsquo;re on the fitness route might as well</p>
<p>go that one don&rsquo;t eat shitty food okay when you&rsquo;re drunk a lot of people will</p>
<p>say greasy food like coats your stomach and it absorbs the alcohol no the fuck</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t oh my god that is the stupidest shit I&rsquo;ve ever heard I have</p>
<p>heard people say eat a bread eat like a piece of bread and it&rsquo;ll absorb the</p>
<p>alcohol that I swear to God it&rsquo;d be doing something like cuz I be like a</p>
<p>piece of toast and I feel better but eating some greasy ass food don&rsquo;t fuck</p>
<p>up your diet like that so like when you&rsquo;re out you know when you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>leaving the bars and there&rsquo;s like hot dog stands and tacos and shit like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>with you like it smells so great but like self-control babe don&rsquo;t fucking eat</p>
<p>it don&rsquo;t eat the greasy food don&rsquo;t eat the shitty food especially when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>hungover too because a lot of people say like oh if you eat greasy food it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>help you feel less hungover no it&rsquo;s not fucking true you might emotionally feel</p>
<p>better but you&rsquo;re not gonna feel better like physically and I&rsquo;ll probably do a</p>
<p>whole other episode about hangover anxiety and like dealing with a</p>
<p>comedown cuz I got you on that bitch there&rsquo;s a lot to know but my trick for</p>
<p>this is prep food like take care of drunk you so this is something that I do</p>
<p>my rising Virgo this is something I do every time I drink I will have food ready</p>
<p>for me when I get home and I&rsquo;m talking like I&rsquo;ll prep something so I can walk</p>
<p>in the house and just fucking eat it like in the fridge I&rsquo;ll either have to</p>
<p>just heat it up in the microwave real quick or I&rsquo;ll just like grab a burger</p>
<p>cold out the fridge and just fucking chow down like I love a cold food when</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m drunk have something prepped and easy cuz like you don&rsquo;t want to come</p>
<p>home and have to fucking meal prep or like cook some food like bitch a box of</p>
<p>cheese it&rsquo;s in the diet 7up that&rsquo;s what I fucking go to when I don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>anything prepped a cheese it there&rsquo;s just something about it ask anyone I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>friends with they know I chat on on some fucking cheese it&rsquo;s okay especially when</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m drinking but yeah that&rsquo;s a really big tip for not fucking your diet is</p>
<p>just have something easy and ready for a drunk you also hydration so I take</p>
<p>care of a drunk me like I said I will make a pitcher of water and I&rsquo;ll put a</p>
<p>packet of Pedialyte in it you can use Pedialyte you can use liquid IV any kind</p>
<p>of electrolyte replacement I&rsquo;ll pour a packet of it into like a gallon of water</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll mix it up and I&rsquo;ll have it in the fridge for when I get home I&rsquo;ll drink a</p>
<p>little bit like not even a glass before I go to bed and then when I wake up in</p>
<p>the morning I have the whole fucking pitcher just sitting there I can just</p>
<p>start chugging because you&rsquo;re gonna be dehydrated as shit and you don&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>want to throw water in yourself you want to have a little bit of electrolytes in</p>
<p>there too I drink the full gallon within like an hour of being awake and I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>being dramatic like you will literally feel like brand fucking new once you</p>
<p>hydrate but that&rsquo;s something that I do also do not take Tylenol before or after</p>
<p>drinking especially the day after like you have a headache do not reach for the</p>
<p>Tylenol get ibuprofen instead or some other shit but like Tylenol is too hard</p>
<p>on your liver you can look it up if you don&rsquo;t fucking trust me I&rsquo;m a goddamn</p>
<p>nurse I know this shit okay so ibuprofen if you need it but stay away from</p>
<p>aspirin too because alcohol thins your blood so you don&rsquo;t want to take aspirin</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s gonna thin it even more so don&rsquo;t fuck around with that just stick</p>
<p>with ibuprofen make sure you have that if you need it try not to take it but</p>
<p>just remember me saying do not take Tylenol when you&rsquo;re drinking also one</p>
<p>more thing I needed to note about the sugar do not eat sugar like a few hours</p>
<p>before you start drinking either like during the day like don&rsquo;t fucking eat</p>
<p>sugar like five hours before you start drinking because you don&rsquo;t want it in</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t mean that you want to avoid the hangover I just remember that so I</p>
<p>want to throw that in but now I want to tell you about vitamins okay I am the</p>
<p>fucking most annoying human being okay I literally take vitamins before and</p>
<p>after I drink and I put them in little ziplock baggies like people think that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fucking drugs all the time I&rsquo;m like no bitch it&rsquo;s vitamins you&rsquo;re fine</p>
<p>you want some but no deadass I have two packs of vitamins that I take and I name</p>
<p>them bitch oh my god it&rsquo;s so embarrassing I have a pregame vitamin</p>
<p>pack for before I go out and then I make an after-party vitamin pack for</p>
<p>when I get home I&rsquo;ll pop the vitamins before I go to bed and then I also have</p>
<p>a couple of vitamins that I take in the morning when I wake up after I drink</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m hydrating so if you want to know what the vitamins are I&rsquo;ll put them</p>
<p>in the description of this podcast like I&rsquo;ll just list them out I&rsquo;ll also post</p>
<p>them on my Instagram I&rsquo;ll make a highlight reel and I&rsquo;ll post the</p>
<p>vitamins that I take the pregame the after-party and I&rsquo;ll also post what I</p>
<p>take after I roll or do should I say that out loud like should I do you know</p>
<p>what it fucking is okay I&rsquo;ll put the vitamins that will help get you back</p>
<p>chemically balanced if you&rsquo;re dealing with a come down to or like just the</p>
<p>shit that I take that I think helps I&rsquo;ll put it in the description of this</p>
<p>podcast you can look at it and I&rsquo;ll also post it on my Instagram as a highlight</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just make it vitamins like I&rsquo;ll just title it vitamins so like the</p>
<p>people that know know so like if you ever need it just go to my Instagram and</p>
<p>see it but I just buy the different vitamins and then I&rsquo;ll just put them</p>
<p>together for myself in the little bags and then I&rsquo;ll take them before and after</p>
<p>I drink and then the day after but the vitamins that I take help my body filter</p>
<p>out the alcohol and get back to like functioning normal after you drink so</p>
<p>the vitamins I take before like preparing my body for the alcohol and</p>
<p>then the vitamins after like helping my body get rid of all the shit and then</p>
<p>the shit in the morning is too it&rsquo;s like just it&rsquo;s best to damage control like I</p>
<p>understand alcohol is a toxin and it&rsquo;s gonna hurt my body so if I&rsquo;m gonna do it</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m gonna like put alcohol into me I&rsquo;m gonna at least do damage control and</p>
<p>take care of my body yeah now like if I&rsquo;m gonna hurt it I&rsquo;ll at least help it</p>
<p>but when I&rsquo;m telling you sleep is so important like you&rsquo;re never gonna sleep</p>
<p>that well after drinking alcohol like it&rsquo;s never you&rsquo;re never gonna get a</p>
<p>fresh night&rsquo;s sleep like you would if you didn&rsquo;t drink but a lot of a shit</p>
<p>that I mentioned at the beginning of this is gonna help with sleeping better</p>
<p>so like none of a stimulants none of that stay the fuck away from it no</p>
<p>fucking sugar and your vitamins they&rsquo;ll definitely help you too also before you</p>
<p>go popping vitamins like I do research them and understand the dosages</p>
<p>understand any conditions that you have like I&rsquo;m just sharing what I take I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not telling you to fucking take them I gotta say this to cover my own ass but</p>
<p>definitely research what I&rsquo;m listing if you don&rsquo;t want to take any of it don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>take it if you only want to take a couple take a couple some is better than</p>
<p>none that&rsquo;s my opinion on it so even if I run out of a certain vitamin I&rsquo;m still</p>
<p>taking the rest but seriously check into medications you&rsquo;re already on check into</p>
<p>your height and weight and what you can handle in the correct dosages for you</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m a big motherfucker all right I take what I take and that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>business but I will share it with you if you want to look into it for yourself</p>
<p>okay so now that I&rsquo;m done with all my tips a lot of you guys asked me the</p>
<p>alcohol that I drink a lot so I&rsquo;m gonna give you a couple of my recommendations</p>
<p>cuz when I said don&rsquo;t get like the expensive bottle so I mainly drink</p>
<p>tequila but I do like a vodka martini here and there at dinner I&rsquo;m not going</p>
<p>out on vodka please I&rsquo;ll go to a dinner and have a vodka but for vodka I&rsquo;ll do</p>
<p>Grey Goose just because the bottle is so cute like I love the frosted but</p>
<p>Belvedere is another common one it&rsquo;s like a little bit better than Grey Goose</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not cute I don&rsquo;t like the tree I don&rsquo;t like the tree on the bottle like</p>
<p>alcohol has to look a certain vibe or I&rsquo;m not drinking it and when I say</p>
<p>Belvedere is a little bit better than Grey Goose I&rsquo;m not talking the taste I</p>
<p>like the taste of Grey Goose the most but I think Belvedere costs a little bit</p>
<p>more a couple more that I know that I don&rsquo;t like are the skull vodka that</p>
<p>shit&rsquo;s awful Tito&rsquo;s is too ugly for me to drink the bottle is disgusting I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like the way it looks I don&rsquo;t like the way it tastes either but like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just ugly like it doesn&rsquo;t taste that bad it&rsquo;s doable but Tito&rsquo;s is hideous</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m not fucking drinking that Ciroc though Ciroc summer watermelon that one</p>
<p>is good it&rsquo;s hard to find it&rsquo;s a little expensive but it&rsquo;s worth it trust me but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really all I know with vodka when it comes to tequila my go-to&rsquo;s like if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to be a cheap-ass 1800 that one is fine you can&rsquo;t go wrong with</p>
<p>it the Coralejo I think that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s called that bottle looks like a</p>
<p>carnival it&rsquo;s so fucking cute it gives New Orleans like I fucking love the</p>
<p>Coralejo bottle I hope that&rsquo;s the right name of it if it&rsquo;s not I&rsquo;m so sorry like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s real cute Casamigos duh like that&rsquo;s like a really</p>
<p>fucking good one Patron I love Patron cuz I just think it has like a nice</p>
<p>taste to it but a lot of people say it&rsquo;s not like the best kind I don&rsquo;t give a</p>
<p>fuck you know like it&rsquo;s fucking tequila the bottles cute it tastes is great leave</p>
<p>me alone but 1800 and Coralejo will be your cheaper options Espalon is really</p>
<p>good too oh my god that&rsquo;s like a happy medium between 1800 and Casamigos and</p>
<p>Patron I feel is it I don&rsquo;t fucking know y&rsquo;all I don&rsquo;t be looking at the price</p>
<p>that much I just know when I was like bumming it and trying to save money I</p>
<p>was rocking the 1800 and I&rsquo;ll be drinking Casamigos and Patron because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s cute and I can afford it but oh my god my favorite tequila of all time it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so hard to find but it is the bougiest fucking bottle I&rsquo;ve ever seen in my life</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s not expensive it&rsquo;s like 60 bucks but I was at a party one time why</p>
<p>am I hanging out with y&rsquo;all and just talking you like we&rsquo;re best friends on</p>
<p>the phone that&rsquo;s how it feels so I was at this party one time and it was like</p>
<p>booze just fuck it was my old party group I used to have when I live the</p>
<p>Pensacola it&rsquo;s like a bunch of doctors and engineers and like high up there</p>
<p>people that are like too big for their fucking britches and I love them but</p>
<p>there was this bottle sitting on the counter and it was Corzo C-O-R-Z-O bitch</p>
<p>this fucking bottle is it&rsquo;s like a brick it&rsquo;s like a square rectangle I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know shapes bitch I know psychology but it was the cutest bottle</p>
<p>and I was like yo that&rsquo;s booze and the guy said it was like a $300 bottle and I</p>
<p>was like oh get it the fuck away from me then like I don&rsquo;t want that like don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it was brand new and I had the seal on it he was like open it and I was like no</p>
<p>like if I drop it like I don&rsquo;t wanna fucking have that pressure like fuck you</p>
<p>you you play with it so he was like no just do it so I fucking opened it I</p>
<p>poured everybody shots and we all took it it was the smoothest shit I&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>tasted I really believed him that it was $300 and when I looked it up online it</p>
<p>was like 60 something and I was like you lying sack of shit you were just trying</p>
<p>to look bougie I ain&rsquo;t mad at you for it because then I started buying it but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so fucking hard to find but I just had to tell you guys like if you can</p>
<p>find Corzo tequila like bitch that&rsquo;s the one it&rsquo;s good like and it looks booze</p>
<p>and I believed it was 300 bucks y&rsquo;all like I have good taste I could spot</p>
<p>money and I really believed it I wholeheartedly was like that&rsquo;s 300 oh my</p>
<p>god better than Don Julio oh that&rsquo;s another good tequila is Don Julio the</p>
<p>silver that one&rsquo;s cutesy that&rsquo;s like a nice um I think it&rsquo;s the same as Patron</p>
<p>same price range but it&rsquo;s cute I like it but the Don Julio 1942 that shit&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>150 160 a bottle that&rsquo;s the tall skinny brown bottle you see all the insta</p>
<p>thotties posting with I posted with it the other night cuz I bought my friend a</p>
<p>bottle when he moved into his new place so I very much was one of the insta</p>
<p>thotties with the fucking Don Julio but that&rsquo;s the tall skinny brown one like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just the bottle everybody knows like you just know that&rsquo;s Don Julio</p>
<p>1942 and if you don&rsquo;t know look it up and I just cultured you you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>honest review it&rsquo;s fucking good okay like I hate that it&rsquo;s good it has like a</p>
<p>little sweetness to it but it&rsquo;s like too fucking ridiculously expensive to like</p>
<p>even play with like get that for special occasion but don&rsquo;t even worry about it</p>
<p>for a night out like that&rsquo;s what this whole podcast was for if you ask me</p>
<p>about whiskey go fuck yourself I don&rsquo;t know I don&rsquo;t play with that I don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>that what other alcohols is there like gin what my fucking best friend</p>
<p>Genevieve she was a Hendrix bitch she liked Hendrix gin like she would just</p>
<p>drink it straight like we were the most chaotic fucking two like I would show up</p>
<p>with a bottle of tequila and she would show up with a bottle of Hendrix and we</p>
<p>would just run around the town like and we would just shoot it straight that was</p>
