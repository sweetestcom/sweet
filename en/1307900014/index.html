    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>It&rsquo;s Hardcore History.</p>
<p>Attention.</p>
<p>I imagine given the subject matter</p>
<p>that I talk about on this program,</p>
<p>that there are quite a few people in the audience</p>
<p>that have played strategy and tactic wargaming type, um,</p>
<p>games on their computer or video console</p>
<p>or what have you over the years.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s a subject that interests you,</p>
<p>gonna have an interview on this program</p>
<p>where we talk to one of the founders of a company</p>
<p>who makes the most up-to-date, modern types of games,</p>
<p>um, you know, with a historical theme and all that.</p>
<p>I found by having the conversation with him</p>
<p>that a lot of the same sorts of, uh, decisions</p>
<p>and trade-offs and questions and quandaries</p>
<p>came up in their development meetings</p>
<p>that we had in the development meetings</p>
<p>for War Remains, the virtual reality project I worked on.</p>
<p>Um, and that&rsquo;s at the World War I Museum</p>
<p>in Kansas City, by the way, if you want to see that.</p>
<p>So, if you like that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>a fascinating interview with Maximilian Rhea,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s, um, uh, game is Hell Let Loose.</p>
<p>And, um, it&rsquo;s a fascinating concept.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;ll talk to him a little bit later.</p>
<p>Uh, it was, if there is a Ben, Ben&rsquo;s idea that we talk about,</p>
<p>we sort of set up the context of that</p>
<p>with a little personal stuff, which I don&rsquo;t like to do.</p>
<p>Uh, and I told Ben, I said,</p>
<p>uh, who cares, it&rsquo;s not very interesting.</p>
<p>And, you know, just me talking about my life,</p>
<p>and Ben said, well, it&rsquo;s not very interesting.</p>
<p>Whose fault is that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hard one to have a pithy comeback for, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>But the reason he brought it up is he said,</p>
<p>you know, you talk about war games</p>
<p>on the program all the time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be talking about something like that</p>
<p>later in the program, why don&rsquo;t you talk about,</p>
<p>you know, war games as you knew them, kind of, or war games.</p>
<p>Now, if this sounds like Grandpa Carlin</p>
<p>on the front porch in the rocking chair,</p>
<p>whittling, telling stories to the young&rsquo;uns,</p>
<p>and falling asleep about every ten minutes,</p>
<p>I apologize.</p>
<p>The good old days, right?</p>
<p>But, um, it might be worth just bringing it up,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s little things about war gaming</p>
<p>that your general member of the general public doesn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the really seminal early rule sets</p>
<p>for the war gaming genre that people played</p>
<p>when I was growing up was written by H.G. Wells,</p>
<p>the War of the Worlds author.</p>
<p>Another thing a lot of people don&rsquo;t know is Wells actually wrote a&hellip;</p>
<p>I think, I know the modern version is in two volumes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember if the original was.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ve ever seen the original.</p>
<p>He wrote a history of the world, too,</p>
<p>from, like, caveman times to his era,</p>
<p>which, um, no matter how it turns out,</p>
<p>think about what a task you set yourself there, right?</p>
<p>My two-volume history of everything that&rsquo;s ever happened.</p>
<p>You know how many podcasts we would have</p>
<p>in that podcast series, given my long-windedness?</p>
<p>But Robert Louis Stevenson, I guess, had an early set of rules.</p>
<p>Um, if you don&rsquo;t know the long history of war games,</p>
<p>some of it has to be sort of imagined,</p>
<p>because you can kind of infer that general staffs</p>
<p>from militaries, you know, of the long lost past,</p>
<p>I mean, the Assyrians had a general staff, right?</p>
<p>Just like the German army had a general staff</p>
<p>in the Second World War, with all the generals</p>
<p>who would, you know, go over.</p>
<p>They would war game by then, certainly.</p>
<p>And one can imagine the great general staffs of all time</p>
<p>trying to figure out, you know, tactics and strategy,</p>
<p>maybe a little sand pit, maybe on a map,</p>
<p>or what passed for a map.</p>
<p>Then there are games that people argue about</p>
<p>whether or not they should be classified as war games.</p>
<p>Games like chess, which is, of course, very old.</p>
<p>The Chinese game of Go, which is also very old.</p>
<p>But without different battlefields</p>
<p>and different terrain and random factors</p>
<p>and all these kinds of things, people sometimes argue,</p>
<p>although they&rsquo;re usually lumped in with the war,</p>
<p>general war gaming sort of genre.</p>
<p>I was reading something just for this discussion just now,</p>
<p>and it was talking about the German version of this,</p>
<p>because the modern history is always thought to begin,</p>
<p>people will talk about Kriegsspiele,</p>
<p>the German name for war game,</p>
<p>because in the late 19th century,</p>
<p>they were clearly playing a sort of mock battle,</p>
<p>setting up battles that they were planning to have,</p>
<p>and then working out all sorts of contingencies</p>
<p>and approaches and trying stuff out.</p>
<p>And I read, and I hadn&rsquo;t heard this before,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s not true, how about that for a disclaimer?</p>
<p>But that the French, there was an element in France</p>
<p>that blamed that as a factor that led to their loss</p>
<p>in the Franco-Prussian War.</p>
<p>I would think maybe railroad timetables</p>
<p>and mobilization and all that might have had more to do with it,</p>
<p>but it was an interesting thing to read, right?</p>
<p>The secret weapon of the 19th century,</p>
<p>you know, Prussians or early German state, war gaming.</p>
<p>I first was, um, exposed to this, I guess you could say.</p>
<p>My mom was doing some work, and we had to live,</p>
<p>had to live, I mean, I have great memories of this,</p>
<p>but I mean, I had to live in London for several months.</p>
<p>And I had my toy soldiers with me,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m about, what, 1972, so I&rsquo;m gonna be six or seven.</p>
<p>Um, always had the toy soldiers,</p>
<p>because for some reason from birth, I&rsquo;m into that stuff,</p>
<p>and I have no explanation for why that might be.</p>
<p>My mother&rsquo;s been trying to figure that out forever,</p>
<p>and her theories border on the fantastic, right?</p>
<p>Bermuda Triangle type stuff.</p>
<p>But, uh, always had the toy soldiers with me.</p>
<p>And in London, I remember having them out on the floor one day,</p>
<p>and a guy arrived, he may have been the son</p>
<p>of one of my mom&rsquo;s guests or something, college student age.</p>
<p>And he brought his soldiers, because my mom had said,</p>
<p>oh, you know, Dan&rsquo;s really into soldiers.</p>
<p>And so he brought his own, went up to see me playing with mine,</p>
<p>and, uh, and sat down and said, you know,</p>
<p>basically sat down and showed me his soldiers,</p>
<p>and I was blown away, because you know the difference</p>
<p>between what you could have bought in a store.</p>
<p>Although what they sold in the store in those days</p>
<p>was pretty damn fantastic.</p>
<p>Uh, you didn&rsquo;t paint them yourself,</p>
<p>they were called, um, Britons.</p>
<p>Uh, Britons Limited, I think.</p>
<p>And they were so fantastic, that I looked them up</p>
<p>and they still make them today, they&rsquo;re hand-painted.</p>
<p>In those days, he had basically a whole army</p>
<p>of hundreds of these things.</p>
<p>Each single figure today sells for like $40 U.S.</p>
<p>And you just sit there and go, holy cow,</p>
<p>you gotta be Elon Musk to have an army of these things today.</p>
<p>Fifty-four millimeters tall.</p>
<p>Um, but he pulls out these troops,</p>
<p>and then he pulls out rules.</p>
<p>And that was the part I&rsquo;d never seen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the part that makes it a war game, right?</p>
<p>Otherwise, you&rsquo;re playing toy soldiers.</p>
<p>And he sat down, he started talking to the six</p>
<p>or seven-year-old version of me,</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t like this one bit, I can tell you right now.</p>
<p>Because for me, it was all imagination,</p>
<p>and anything I wanted, and I didn&rsquo;t have time</p>
<p>to worry about anything, and this guy was basically</p>
<p>giving me stuff like math to do.</p>
<p>And lots of calculations and figuring out,</p>
<p>and I mean, it ruined the spontaneity</p>
<p>and the creativity of it all for me.</p>
<p>But as you get older, you see the value</p>
<p>in something like that, right?</p>
<p>So, fast forward to right around the era</p>
<p>where Dungeons and Dragons started.</p>
<p>So about 1976, I&rsquo;m going from memory here.</p>
<p>A rule set comes out called Chainmail.</p>
<p>Chainmail actually came out in the very early 70s,</p>
<p>I want to say like 1971.</p>
<p>And I discovered all this stuff later,</p>
<p>so when I say 1976, that&rsquo;s when I got into it.</p>
<p>It happened to be written by two people,</p>
<p>one of whom was Gary Gyjax,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s probably the lead figure in Dungeons and Dragons.</p>
<p>I think of other guys like Dave Arneson and whatnot,</p>
<p>but Gary Gyjax is sort of the lead D&amp;D guy.</p>
<p>And Dungeons and Dragons, I think, came out in 1974.</p>
<p>Again, I discovered all this stuff in about 1976.</p>
<p>Now, in the early Dungeons and Dragons rule sets,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t even tell you how to do certain things</p>
<p>like how you would handle, you know, groups of people</p>
<p>fighting other groups of people if there were large numbers.</p>
<p>They would simply refer you in the rule set to Chainmail.</p>
<p>So you had to go pick up Chainmail</p>
<p>if you wanted to do those sorts of calculations.</p>
<p>So I went out and got Chainmail,</p>
<p>which was my first exposure since London in the early 1970s</p>
<p>to war games rules, right?</p>
<p>Meant to be played with miniature figures.</p>
<p>And I was older then and could appreciate</p>
<p>and understand and all this sort of stuff.</p>
<p>And so I started experimenting with that.</p>
<p>So then what you do is you realize,</p>
<p>oh, I need to build an army,</p>
<p>which was not that easy to do in the middle 1970s.</p>
<p>You gotta go find a place that sells this stuff.</p>
<p>And the funny thing about it is this was a place, I believe,</p>
<p>that Britain was way ahead of the United States.</p>
<p>It was hard in the United States.</p>
<p>There was a guy named Jack Scrooby</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s famous in the American war game circles</p>
<p>who became one of these early people</p>
<p>that started to just crank out figures for people,</p>
<p>not because he wanted to make a lot of money,</p>
<p>but because everybody needed figures</p>
<p>or there was not gonna be a hobby, right?</p>
<p>But you would gravitate towards places</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know what you would do</p>
<p>if you lived in some small town,</p>
<p>but this is like New York and Seattle,</p>
<p>San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston,</p>
<p>places where these, they&rsquo;re almost like clubs.</p>
<p>The people that ran these stores</p>
<p>could not have been in it to get rich.</p>
<p>But not only would they sell the materials,</p>
<p>oftentimes they would have big tables in the back</p>
<p>where people could come and fight battles and have,</p>
<p>I mean, it became, these were little communities.</p>
<p>I mean, if you were where I was from,</p>
<p>in the San Fernando Valley, 1970s, 1980s,</p>
<p>you would have remembered places like Competitor&rsquo;s Castle</p>
<p>with Skip Gardella, and I wonder what Skip&rsquo;s doing today.</p>
<p>Hope he&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>The Last Grenadier, Les Mis√©rables de Guerre,</p>
<p>every community of large size had these places.</p>
<p>And you didn&rsquo;t do a lot of cross-pollinating.</p>
<p>I mean, I felt like it was almost a school</p>
<p>or a fraternity or something like that</p>
<p>where, you know, you had your place</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;d meet up with all these other people</p>
<p>at some convention down by the airport,</p>
<p>you know, a couple of times a year,</p>
<p>have big battles, competitions.</p>
<p>The thing about wargaming with miniature figures,</p>
<p>which is how I did it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s different from what we have today,</p>
<p>is there was a lot of elements to the hobby</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t need with a computer game,</p>
<p>but that I find that I like more than I thought I did.</p>
<p>I mean, the painting of the figures.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a railroad, you know, a model railroad side of this too,</p>
<p>where people are building terrain</p>
<p>and laying out battlefields.</p>
<p>And, I mean, there&rsquo;s many different creative elements</p>
<p>involved in this before you even get to fighting it all out.</p>
<p>Now, fighting it all out, I have to say,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t miss that stuff at all.</p>
<p>Let the computer handle the calculations.</p>
<p>Let it automatically just take away</p>
<p>what was a huge aspect of wargaming and miniatures</p>
<p>back in the day, which is arguing.</p>
<p>Fighting over what a rule interpretation meant,</p>
<p>or did you really move this way,</p>
<p>or is this unit gonna hit the forest and be disordered?</p>
<p>I mean, nobody really liked that</p>
<p>unless you were what was known as a rules lawyer,</p>
<p>where part of the way you won</p>
<p>was not your great tactical expertise, right?</p>
<p>And you outthink the other guy.</p>
<p>No, you just have these little rule things that you noticed,</p>
<p>or maybe you know it backwards or forwards.</p>
<p>You have ways of basically arguing</p>
<p>that you should get some sort of benefit</p>
<p>that ends up leading to, well, if not a victory</p>
<p>for the rules lawyer, then a less drastic defeat.</p>
<p>I pulled out a bunch of my old books on the hobby.</p>
<p>And some of them date from before my era.</p>
<p>I went back and picked up some classics</p>
<p>by people like Donald Featherstone,</p>
<p>Joseph Morshauser, lots of stuff from Phil Barker,</p>
<p>even in the modern era.</p>
<p>Phil&rsquo;s still involved. I&rsquo;m not sure, but I think he is.</p>
<p>Tony Bath, people like that with the classics</p>
<p>on the other side of the pond.</p>
<p>And it was so clubby even then</p>
<p>that when you would buy a set of rules,</p>
<p>in the back, it would be like,</p>
<p>hey, if you want to get a hold of us, here&rsquo;s our address.</p>
<p>You can call us at this hour, but we might be gone during&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, it was so informal and clubbish</p>
<p>that you felt like the guys that wrote this</p>
<p>were just your buddy down the street.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s how insular and small some of these things were.</p>
<p>If you think about it, there&rsquo;s quite an entry-level amount</p>
<p>of stuff that&rsquo;s required to get into it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a barrier, right?</p>
<p>I mean, this is not easy stuff to do.</p>
<p>The time commitment alone is onerous.</p>
<p>You have to be a bit of a fanatic.</p>
<p>But I certainly was one of those people.</p>
<p>And so when computer games first showed up,</p>
<p>I was so excited because, I mean,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t need an opponent, you didn&rsquo;t need to spend all day</p>
<p>if you didn&rsquo;t have a whole day.</p>
<p>There were a lot of things that were very attractive about it.</p>
<p>And even in the very early games,</p>
<p>you could see without being any kind of a technology expert,</p>
<p>oh, my God, give this ten years,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be in fabulously interesting places.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s funny about me is the game</p>
<p>that I play the most these days</p>
<p>is a game that simply tries to replicate</p>
<p>the miniatures version of the games</p>
<p>that I played in the 1970s on a computer screen.</p>
<p>I mean, graphically speaking, it&rsquo;s Stone Age.</p>
<p>And everything moves, just, I mean, it&rsquo;s hilarious</p>
<p>because instead of having their more modern games</p>
<p>where everyone moves sort of like individually</p>
<p>and takes advantage of all the computer&rsquo;s power</p>
<p>and yet something in my, you know,</p>
<p>maybe this is an elderly thing, you know,</p>
<p>when you get nostalgic and you&rsquo;d rather have</p>
<p>the computer game play like Pong for you</p>
<p>because you grew up with Pong.</p>
<p>It brings back memories.</p>
<p>One thing I should mention,</p>
<p>and I only thought about this</p>
<p>in preparation for this conversation,</p>
<p>there was no blood.</p>
<p>There was no violence,</p>
<p>unless it was between two players arguing with each other.</p>
<p>I mean, these games had miniature figures,</p>
<p>whether it was in the pre-Gunpowder era,</p>
<p>which I often played,</p>
<p>or the Second World War era, which I also played.</p>
<p>And if somebody died, when you had casualties,</p>
<p>you wrote it down on a piece of paper.</p>
<p>You know, you do the math, you come up with your figures,</p>
<p>you say, okay, you suffered 17 casualties in that charge.</p>
<p>Okay, that doesn&rsquo;t even tell you how many are wounded</p>
<p>versus how many are dead.</p>
<p>You write it down on a piece of paper.</p>
<p>Every time we got 20 or 25 casualties,</p>
<p>you took a miniature figure off.</p>
<p>That is the extent, though,</p>
<p>of the connection between what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and the violence that you&rsquo;re basically abstracting</p>
<p>on the ground that would be there in the real-time situation.</p>
<p>In the Second World War games we used to play,</p>
<p>it was mostly vehicles.</p>
<p>A tank would be hit, you&rsquo;d say, that tank is destroyed.</p>
<p>Maybe somebody creative puts a little puff of black cotton</p>
<p>on it to represent smoke, and there you go.</p>
<p>A little bit different, though,</p>
<p>from some of the things you see nowadays,</p>
<p>and that brings up interesting questions all its own, right?</p>
<p>I mean, all of these developments,</p>
<p>just like Dungeons &amp; Dragons back in the old days,</p>
<p>by the way, people forget how controversial that was</p>
<p>for a time, always come with societal sort of quandaries</p>
<p>that one can talk about.</p>
<p>The difference between the violence involved</p>
<p>in the wargaming I grew up with</p>
<p>and some of the games today is significant.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk a little about that in the upcoming conversation.</p>
<p>In any case, I&rsquo;ve had a long history</p>
<p>with these sorts of games.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been the sort of guy, I think in my head,</p>
<p>whatever Bermuda Triangle my mother thinks I sprang from,</p>
<p>interested in this stuff from birth.</p>
<p>I always wanted to be at like the Napoleon level of things,</p>
<p>you know, in control of the battlefield.</p>
<p>Or like Hearts of Iron, the Hearts of Iron franchise</p>
<p>basically makes you the head of the government,</p>
<p>and you get to decide what sort of scientific experiments</p>
<p>you want to take part in to develop, you know, things along.</p>
<p>I mean, you get to be like a demigod.</p>
<p>I like those levels, you know, surprise, surprise,</p>
<p>rather than the Sergeant York, you know, on the battlefield</p>
<p>with the squad sort of level.</p>
<p>But the guest that I&rsquo;m gonna speak to in just a minute,</p>
<p>Maximilian Rhea, he&rsquo;s developed the kind of game</p>
<p>where when I was playing the Pong version of wargames</p>
<p>on the very early personal computers,</p>
<p>you could see in your mind&rsquo;s eye coming.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>The game in question is called Hell Let Loose,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s part of a genre that many of you</p>
<p>will have a lot of experience with.</p>
<p>And there are all sorts of interesting questions</p>
<p>that these games sort of prompt and have connected to them.</p>
<p>And those are the sorts of things</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna talk about right now.</p>
<p>With me right now is Maximilian Rhea.</p>
<p>He is one of the founders and also the project director</p>
<p>and art director over at Black Matter Studios,</p>
<p>the developers of Hell Let Loose.</p>
<p>Tell me a little bit about your game here,</p>
<p>so that the public understands just how far things have gone</p>
<p>in terms of development in the wargaming space.</p>
<p>Sure thing. So, our game, Hell Let Loose,</p>
<p>pits 50 players versus 50 other human players.</p>
<p>So, 100 human players in total against each other</p>
<p>in combat on a World War II battlefield</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve sort of recreated from lots of satellite imagery</p>
<p>to map out the landscape and then copious amounts</p>
<p>of reference photography and aerial photography.</p>
<p>And basically, these two forces,</p>
<p>so initially it&rsquo;s US forces versus German forces,</p>
<p>fight over this piece of land much like they did in World War II</p>
<p>using the iconic weaponry of the day and the vehicles of the day.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve kind of tried to match that as much as possible</p>
<p>to the historical record with some flex where we need it,</p>
<p>just due to the nature of games as a medium.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s kind of where we&rsquo;re at now</p>
<p>in so much as video games are concerned as a digital art form.</p>
<p>So, in terms of what people&rsquo;s expectations are, right?</p>
<p>So, everything is built on top of what came before.</p>
<p>Is this a new level?</p>
<p>Because, you know, you had sent me a screenshot</p>
<p>of a particular defensive position,</p>
<p>Pavlov&rsquo;s house at the Battle of Stalingrad.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re talking to me about how,</p>
<p>until you actually saw it portrayed and rendered</p>
<p>in a form that made it visual and three-dimensional,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t even realize how tough a position this was.</p>
<p>I can remember first-person shooter games.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t play them, but I remember the graphics and stuff</p>
<p>way back in the mid-1990s.</p>
<p>How much of a step up is this in terms of a faithful rendering</p>
<p>of what people at the time would have seen</p>
<p>in that place and in that sphere?</p>
<p>So, I think something that kind of modern computing power</p>
<p>is enabling us to do is, I mean, first of all,</p>
<p>video games are always representative.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re always symbolic of, obviously, something that&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>We can never quite capture the full historical reality</p>
<p>of any conflict, I mean, mainly because it might not be</p>
<p>something that players would be willing to put their time into playing.</p>
<p>You know, a lot of combat, as we both know,</p>
<p>was huge amounts of waiting around or doing very, very menial, difficult tasks.</p>
<p>However, where we are able to symbolize things,</p>
<p>what modern computing power lets us do is represent them at a larger scale.</p>
<p>So, for instance, as you said, Dan, Pavlov&rsquo;s House,</p>
<p>this famous Soviet apartment building in Stalingrad,</p>
<p>previously, when it&rsquo;s been portrayed in games,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been being portrayed at a compressed size,</p>
<p>almost everything at half or a third scale.</p>
<p>And something that we&rsquo;ve done in our particular game</p>
<p>is just modern computing power has enabled us</p>
<p>to render this at the actual real scale that it is in real life,</p>
<p>including sort of measurements for the apartment building and the square.</p>
<p>So, I think what modern computing power is enabling us to do</p>
<p>is increase the size of our representation of these historic conflicts.</p>
<p>And obviously, something else that&rsquo;s quite novel</p>
<p>and is growing by really the year is the player count.</p>
<p>Modern networking power,</p>
<p>the amount of information you can send over the internet,</p>
<p>is increasing as players get better access to better internet,</p>
<p>and the systems also become more sophisticated.</p>
<p>And so, something we were quite quick on was doing 100 players.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn&rsquo;t seem like a lot of players,</p>
<p>a lot of soldiers on a battlefield, and it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a step up from 64, and 64 is a step up from 32,</p>
<p>and 32 is a step up from 16,</p>
<p>and 16 was obviously a step up from only being single player,</p>
<p>that is, not playing with other players around the world.</p>
<p>And so, what we&rsquo;re kind of looking into the future at</p>
<p>is the scale just getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>And obviously, then the mind starts to wonder about how big could you go,</p>
<p>and what would that representation be like of these different battles</p>
<p>and just broader experiences generally.</p>
<p>So, other than the increasing number of players</p>
<p>that can be incorporated into a game,</p>
<p>what sort of feedback are you getting from users</p>
<p>in terms of what they like and what they&rsquo;d like to see more of?</p>
<p>In other words, when they give you a wish list for the next version,</p>
<p>what are they asking for?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s always a mixture.</p>
<p>It always depends on the player.</p>
<p>But I think for our title, or at least any title</p>
<p>trying to capture historical reality</p>
<p>or what people&rsquo;s idea of historical reality is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always to expand it to offer more fronts, more battlefields.</p>
<p>But then it&rsquo;s obviously also to deepen the fidelity.</p>
<p>And what that can mean is it could mean having realistic flamethrowers</p>
<p>that project liquid fuel in the same way they did on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Or it might mean very, very complex simulations of armor penetration</p>
<p>and the way that different rounds and projectiles</p>
<p>struck different armor platings and thicknesses.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of where we&rsquo;re being pushed within our kind of subgenre</p>
<p>of this sort of hardcore military historical shooter.</p>
<p>But obviously across gaming,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re expanding out in many, many different ways.</p>
<p>And obviously, you know, very exciting</p>
<p>and obviously also with some trepidation as well.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s talk about that part of it,</p>
<p>because as a guy who&rsquo;s been wargaming since the early 1970s,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an abstraction to the traditional wargaming</p>
<p>that sort of does away with the very thing</p>
<p>that is the focus of the fidelity first-person shooter games.</p>
<p>I mean, when I&rsquo;m playing a tank battle in the 1970s,</p>
<p>I might have 30 or 40 figures representing tanks,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no real human beings there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no one burning up.</p>
<p>When a tank destroys another tank,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost as though it&rsquo;s an inanimate object.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re playing a form of chess, kind of, that divorces you from&hellip;</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s strategy and tactics</p>
<p>more than there&rsquo;s any sense of realism.</p>
<p>It seems to me that it is both the attraction</p>
<p>and also, like you said, sort of the dicey,</p>
<p>interesting moral quandary area</p>
<p>where the fidelity of the game,</p>
<p>especially at the ground level, creates challenges.</p>
<p>And listen, this has nothing to do specifically with your game.</p>
<p>I mean, this goes&hellip; Since first-person shooters started,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been a question of how much of this is&hellip;</p>
<p>is all of the fun and adrenaline and action</p>
<p>with none of the consequences.</p>
<p>But, for example, I&hellip;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the problem I have with this,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s that I don&rsquo;t do this personally,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s hard for me to put myself in the shoes</p>
<p>of what people get out of this.</p>
<p>But this is a hugely and fabulously lucrative area</p>
<p>of video games. People love doing this,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re shooting at zombies or trolls</p>
<p>or vampires or other people.</p>
<p>How do you, as a designer, walk this fine line</p>
<p>between something that is intended to be both fun</p>
<p>and potentially teach people about history</p>
<p>and make them understand better</p>
<p>what people were dealing with historically</p>
<p>versus simply the enjoyment that comes</p>
<p>with shooting another human being in a virtual world</p>
<p>and watching their head explode?</p>
<p>Look, I think it&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very&hellip; I&rsquo;m sorry to make the question</p>
<p>so damn long.</p>
<p>No, no, no. I know.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s a fantastic question.</p>
<p>And I think it needs, you know&hellip;</p>
<p>And in return, it needs a relatively detailed answer.</p>
<p>And I think&hellip;</p>
<p>Look, I think for better or worse,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re doing with video games</p>
<p>is largely what we&rsquo;ve done with war gaming</p>
<p>insomuch as, as I sort of touched on,</p>
<p>we know that everything is representative,</p>
<p>everything is symbolic.</p>
<p>Now, obviously, we are getting far closer</p>
<p>within our symbolism,</p>
<p>insomuch as within our game, for instance,</p>
<p>and many other games, obviously,</p>
<p>first-person shooters, the entire game loop</p>
<p>which is sort of what we call the experience</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re repeating in the game</p>
<p>over and over and over again.</p>
<p>So, sort of dribbling the ball</p>
<p>and putting it in the goal</p>
<p>and in football and in soccer</p>
<p>would be the gameplay loop of soccer.</p>
<p>In our gameplay loop, you are using a gun,</p>
<p>depending on what role you play,</p>
<p>to shoot another, you know, another represented human</p>
<p>with the aim of taking a position</p>
<p>in order to win the game.</p>
<p>Taking a trench network</p>
<p>or taking an artillery position.</p>
<p>The thing is, though, it is representative</p>
<p>insomuch as all the players within the game know</p>
<p>that failure means that they are to respawn,</p>
<p>so come back into the game</p>
<p>further back from the front line.</p>
<p>The way that we sort of represent this</p>
<p>is that the player over the course of the game</p>
<p>is representing many, many a weight of number</p>
<p>than just themselves.</p>
<p>And fundamentally, the kind of endgame conversations</p>
<p>that you have in a game like ours</p>
<p>and other first-person shooters</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t actually touch on the idea of</p>
<p>or the joy of the actual shooting another person.</p>
<p>And what it largely focuses on,</p>
<p>and I would almost say in the majority,</p>
<p>is the tactics and the strategy,</p>
<p>much like wargaming,</p>
<p>in achieving a success over the enemy</p>
<p>in the broader context of the battle.</p>
<p>So in the same way that with wargaming</p>
<p>you might move a panzer unit into position</p>
<p>in a way that your opponent didn&rsquo;t expect</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re able to defeat the opposing formation</p>
<p>or the opposing unit,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing a very, very similar thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of the hook to the player</p>
<p>on the ground level in the game.</p>
<p>So I think, look,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to give a mealy-mouthed answer,</p>
<p>but I think that the more that I&rsquo;ve thought about it,</p>
<p>the more we&rsquo;re trying to set up</p>
<p>these sort of strategic and tactical questions</p>
<p>in the game.</p>
<p>And obviously in doing so at an infantry level</p>
<p>and within an individualistic way</p>
<p>for players who choose to play</p>
<p>as kind of frontline infantry roles,</p>
<p>that does involve, obviously, firing a weapon</p>
<p>and firing it in anger at an enemy human target.</p>
<p>However, I would say that it is,</p>
<p>and it sounds funny to say this,</p>
<p>but a very small part of,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d almost argue almost an insignificant part</p>
<p>of what makes this genre tick.</p>
<p>And I think you can kind of see that</p>
<p>in other first-person shooter genres</p>
<p>where you may not even, you know,</p>
<p>shooting a player may not even result in their death.</p>
<p>The way it&rsquo;s represented on screen won&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>them blood pouring out and shot and falling over.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll just be their removal from the battlefield</p>
<p>for them to come back later.</p>
<p>So much more of a sort of a very obviously gamified version.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s kind of the thing</p>
<p>in so much as players don&rsquo;t have much of an attention span</p>
<p>if the sole object, the sole pleasure, the sole purpose</p>
<p>is just to try and experience</p>
<p>that visceral idea of killing someone.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s far more about</p>
<p>the strategical and tactical maneuvering</p>
<p>that sees sort of long-term victory.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that&rsquo;s the best sort of explanation</p>
<p>I can give of the genre</p>
<p>because I understand from the outset looking at it,</p>
<p>it is, you know, it seems like that is the sole object.</p>
<p>Whereas I think the thing that hooks most players</p>
<p>is that greater strategic and tactical layer.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s certainly what we see</p>
<p>in sort of the communities of people who follow these games.</p>
<p>A lot of the conversation does drill down</p>
<p>to very, very, very esoteric topics,</p>
<p>like, you know, the gear speed of particular vehicles,</p>
<p>enabling them to get to a certain point</p>
<p>of the battlefield faster than the other people,</p>
<p>that sort of thing,</p>
<p>and less on the designed experience</p>
<p>of simulated killing of the enemy,</p>
<p>if that makes sense.</p>
<p>It does, because a lot of that follows</p>
<p>from the earlier war games we used to play</p>
<p>where you would talk about tank specifications</p>
<p>and speeds and turning radiuses</p>
<p>and how quickly the turret would move, things like&hellip;</p>
<p>So I totally get all that.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t decide,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d like to get your opinion on it,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been swaying back and forth,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve certainly not thought about it</p>
<p>for one bazillionth of the amount of time</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve thought about it.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t decide how I feel about the fidelity</p>
<p>of the human damage, right?</p>
<p>So when a gun or a grenade or anything</p>
<p>does damage to a human being in the game,</p>
<p>a virtual human being,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t decide if you want to make it more graphic</p>
<p>because that actually helps bring a reality into this</p>
<p>that makes people think.</p>
<p>In other words, the more graphic you make it,</p>
<p>the more you go,</p>
<p>oh, this is a really nasty thing to get hit with.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be involved with this in real life.</p>
<p>Or I sometimes go to the other extreme</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m thinking, okay,</p>
<p>the bigger the splat of red ink</p>
<p>that layers on the ground,</p>
<p>the more I&rsquo;m getting a kick out of that.</p>
<p>How do we deal with the fidelity question</p>
<p>and the way that that impacts the player?</p>
<p>I mean, one could argue, I think,</p>
<p>that the more brutal you make it,</p>
<p>the more you help compensate</p>
<p>for some of these other things we&rsquo;ve been talking about.</p>
<p>The other side of it is the more brutal you make it,</p>
<p>maybe more of a kick to people</p>
<p>who like that are getting out of it.</p>
<p>How do you guys measure that</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re trying to design this thing</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re talking about representations,</p>
<p>for example, of what a grenade does</p>
<p>if it explodes in your midsection and whatnot?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s got to be an interesting</p>
<p>fly-on-the-wall sort of moment in the room</p>
<p>when you guys are designing these things.</p>
<p>It definitely is.</p>
<p>I mean, I think, and interestingly,</p>
<p>I think it actually comes down to sort of your philosophy</p>
<p>about the preservation of history,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t want to give a sort of politician&rsquo;s answer,</p>
<p>but for us, the way that we&rsquo;ve approached this</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;re trying to, as best as possible,</p>
<p>display to you, to the best of our knowledge,</p>
<p>what would happen in real life</p>
<p>in kind of nearly every instance</p>
<p>of what you encounter in the game.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re making any piece of media,</p>
<p>and video games obviously being no exception,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re always making decisions about what you include</p>
<p>because sort of nothing&rsquo;s there existing before you start.</p>
<p>So we have to build all the systems,</p>
<p>we have to create all the character models,</p>
<p>all of our soldiers,</p>
<p>we have to create even the look of the dirt on the ground</p>
<p>and the way the trees sway and everything like that.</p>
<p>And I think you reach this really interesting conundrum,</p>
<p>as you have touched on, where historically,</p>
<p>and I think depiction of the German forces,</p>
<p>Nazism, things like that,</p>
<p>very, very contentious and extremely difficult topics</p>
<p>can be approached in many different ways.</p>
<p>And I think something we&rsquo;ve tried to do</p>
<p>is to present the recorded history</p>
<p>without softening or doing anyone any favours</p>
<p>by deciding to curate in a particular way,</p>
<p>one way or another.</p>
<p>And what I mean by that is</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t want to soften the violence of war,</p>
<p>because we feel that it would do a disrespect</p>
<p>to the memories of those people who fought and died.</p>
<p>And we obviously don&rsquo;t want to encourage killing either.</p>
<p>But we felt that it&rsquo;s very important to depict here</p>
<p>what happened when these people were given this weaponry</p>
<p>and they fought each other.</p>
<p>As a way, I think, of preserving this.</p>
<p>And you see this done in films,</p>
<p>which obviously have a much stronger narrative presence</p>
<p>and have a much greater ability</p>
<p>to inform your moral take on the events that are unfolding.</p>
<p>And obviously, video games have a harder time with that,</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re making a multiplayer game, as we are,</p>
<p>it becomes extremely difficult to have any narrative voice.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s simply no part in the game.</p>
<p>Just as you would be watching a game of football,</p>
<p>really, you would need a commentator to give colour</p>
<p>and story to the actions unfolding on the screen</p>
<p>in a way that lets you morally connect with it</p>
<p>and not just understand the plays as they were happening.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s extremely fraught.</p>
<p>And the way that we&rsquo;ve approached this attempt</p>
<p>at preserving history is to do justice</p>
<p>to the violence of war, the violence of this conflict,</p>
<p>to not reward it.</p>
<p>But then also, we do know that there is some element</p>
<p>of people&rsquo;s reaction that is out of our control.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a caveat.</p>
<p>But what we&rsquo;ve found with our community</p>
<p>and the people who play the game</p>
<p>is that conversations about the violence within the game</p>
<p>are actually almost the last thing they comment on</p>
<p>and more what takes centre stage</p>
<p>is an appreciation of the minutia and the detail</p>
<p>on different weapons and different uniforms, on vehicles,</p>
<p>the layout of maps and things like that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an extremely fraught topic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely difficult.</p>
<p>But I think for us, our perspective of the history</p>
<p>is to present it as it was and then let the players decide</p>
<p>whether this is horrendous or whatever</p>
<p>and not try and soften it for them</p>
<p>because we feel that the violence of this</p>
<p>needs to be understood.</p>
<p>I think in the same way that someone like Spielberg</p>
<p>made very, very concerted decisions</p>
<p>within his portrayal in Saving Private Ryan</p>
<p>of the violence of war to show the human impact,</p>
<p>the impact of the violence on the civilian population of France</p>
<p>and that really heartbreaking scene</p>
<p>where Vin Diesel&rsquo;s character is shot by the German sniper.</p>
<p>And then we also see the returning fire</p>
<p>on the German sniper as well.</p>
<p>And I think that it was interesting</p>
<p>that Spielberg decided to show the horrendousness of that</p>
<p>to the audience.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s sort of our approach to this.</p>
<p>It may not be a perfect one,</p>
<p>but we are really approaching it in good faith</p>
<p>from a historical perspective</p>
<p>and trying not to, you know,</p>
<p>trying not to curate away from the nastier side of it.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s interesting you went right where I was going to go</p>
<p>to the Spielberg type stuff because I was&hellip;</p>
<p>See, and that&rsquo;s a perfect example of the artistic trade-offs</p>
<p>because it was always my contention</p>
<p>because that movie garnered such attention</p>
<p>when it first came out for being so realistic</p>
<p>and my critique was that it wasn&rsquo;t realistic enough</p>
<p>and the fact that the media thought</p>
<p>that that was what war looked like</p>
<p>when it was realistic was an example right there</p>
<p>that it didn&rsquo;t have a real idea of what real war was like.</p>
<p>And so I thought it should have been more vicious,</p>
<p>more graphic and the whole thing.</p>
<p>And yet Spielberg, in the same way, you know,</p>
<p>we did a virtual reality First World War exhibit.</p>
<p>I did it with a bunch of other people</p>
<p>and we had these meetings where we had the same kinds</p>
<p>of questions coming up, which is,</p>
<p>do you really want to make it as graphic and horrible as it was?</p>
<p>And if you did, would anybody go to take part in it?</p>
<p>If Spielberg shows you what war really looks like,</p>
<p>does anybody go to the movie, right?</p>
<p>Or does it get an X rating so nobody can go to the movie?</p>
<p>I also want to point out that your game</p>
<p>is part of a long history of a genre</p>
<p>that people are very comfortable with right now,</p>
<p>so you shouldn&rsquo;t have to answer all these basic questions</p>
<p>about first-person shooter things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in the idea, though,</p>
<p>of taking this to the next level</p>
<p>and one of the things that your game does</p>
<p>is push the boundaries of realism,</p>
<p>the feeling of a three-dimensional space</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re cooperating with other people.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s elements in this which are new, I would think.</p>
<p>Am I right in saying that?</p>
<p>Would you say that this game pushes certain boundaries</p>
<p>in terms of directions in the genre?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it does, definitely.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d say, you know, like everyone,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re always standing on the shoulders of giants</p>
<p>and the people who came before us.</p>
<p>And I think in the context of video gaming,</p>
<p>I mean, video games,</p>
<p>to blow the trumpet of the video game industry for a moment,</p>
<p>is an art form.</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s a very young art form as well.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s only really existed, you could argue,</p>
<p>sort of for 40 or 50 years, at best, at a big stretch,</p>
<p>and only really becoming popular</p>
<p>to a sort of majoritarian context,</p>
<p>I think, in the last 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p>It certainly changed hugely from when I was young to now,</p>
<p>the number of people who play them and engage with them.</p>
<p>And like all art forms,</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;s always evolving on itself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always trying to develop on itself.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re one in a long line of people</p>
<p>who have been doing that.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re definitely right in so much as,</p>
<p>I think, we&rsquo;re evolving towards teamwork.</p>
<p>I think our game, in particular,</p>
<p>is appealing more towards an older player base,</p>
<p>one who&rsquo;s not just interested in being very, very good at aiming,</p>
<p>but is also really interested in communication,</p>
<p>in community itself,</p>
<p>in working with larger and larger groups of players</p>
<p>and coordinating and finding success in that coordination.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re kind of seeing this across</p>
<p>the whole video game genre.</p>
<p>Games that, you know, 10, 15 years ago,</p>
<p>you would think were completely commercially non-viable,</p>
<p>I would argue we would be in that category as well,</p>
<p>have started to take a greater portion of the market,</p>
<p>you know, an ever-growing market.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been very, very interesting</p>
<p>to kind of see that happen.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very, very interesting also</p>
<p>to think about the future and where it might go.</p>
<p>And I think the best guess anyone has</p>
<p>is to look at what we have now</p>
<p>and just to imagine what happens</p>
<p>if it gets bigger and pushes further in that direction,</p>
<p>pushes further in the direction of teamwork,</p>
<p>pushes further in the direction of scale, strategy, planning.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just for our genre.</p>
<p>You know, I think that the same can be said</p>
<p>of every genre within video gaming,</p>
<p>that it will find new ways to iterate on itself.</p>
<p>I mean, virtual reality alone,</p>
<p>I think is going to have an extremely significant impact</p>
<p>I mean, dare I say it, on humanity</p>
<p>once they solve sort of the issues</p>
<p>around getting one into every household.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s going to be extremely interesting</p>
<p>to see where it goes.</p>
<p>So, yeah, the video game genre</p>
<p>just seems to continue to iterate</p>
<p>at an absolutely breakneck pace.</p>
<p>And so something, I guess, that we were doing that was new,</p>
<p>you know, now may no longer be new</p>
<p>as of, you know, a year ago, a week ago, a day ago.</p>
<p>So I brought up some of the traditional</p>
<p>and maybe almost stereotypical downsides of the genre.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s talk about some of the upsides.</p>
<p>Wargaming was something that helped deepen</p>
<p>and amplified and accelerated my enjoyment</p>
<p>and interest in history.</p>
<p>I can only imagine,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to know so much more about this than I,</p>
<p>I can only imagine the same effect</p>
<p>that this is having with young people coming up today</p>
<p>who might never think of cracking a book</p>
<p>or going down and doing any research themselves on history</p>
<p>until something like this prompted</p>
<p>the spark in them of interest.</p>
<p>Do you see this as, I mean,</p>
<p>if old-fashioned wargaming with miniature figures</p>
<p>that you hand-painted yourself could have that effect on me,</p>
<p>do you think that this is something</p>
<p>that becomes an introductory path</p>
<p>for people to become more interested</p>
<p>in the period being displayed</p>
<p>and that they&rsquo;re learning about as they go through these things?</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>I mean, this is actually something extremely close to home for me.</p>
<p>So during the 90s,</p>
<p>the early 90s when I was growing up,</p>
<p>my father would spend nights relaxing</p>
<p>after he got home from work</p>
<p>by painting little figurines</p>
<p>of the Scots Grey Cavalry at Waterloo.</p>
<p>And he had basically a tabletop of Waterloo set up.</p>
<p>And I would watch him paint these small figurines</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think he ever got around to actually wargaming them.</p>
<p>He just really enjoyed the catharsis</p>
<p>of painting these tiny miniatures.</p>
<p>And from there, he then, you know, sort of Age of Empires,</p>
<p>I think, came out in 1997 or 1998.</p>
<p>Age of Empires was really one of the first</p>
<p>sort of very accessible historical games.</p>
<p>It was an extremely vibrant game.</p>
<p>It told the story of Genghis Khan,</p>
<p>of Joan of Arc,</p>
<p>of&hellip;</p>
<p>His name escapes me, the Holy Roman Emperor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doing a very good job of it right now, but&hellip;</p>
<p>Charlemagne.</p>
<p>Charlemagne, Charlemagne, excuse me.</p>
<p>But this game, my dad showed me this game</p>
<p>and he took an interest in it, obviously,</p>
<p>because of his love of history.</p>
<p>And he introduced me to this game</p>
<p>and this game introduced me</p>
<p>to the stories of these extremely iconic,</p>
<p>but very dispersed historical figures.</p>
<p>And I would have been only kind of 8, 9 or 10.</p>
<p>And it just gripped me entirely.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s an interesting microcosm of my dad</p>
<p>going from wargaming,</p>
<p>or at least painting and appreciating all the miniatures,</p>
<p>to video games,</p>
<p>and then that being directly given to me.</p>
<p>And I also should say that, you know,</p>
<p>he still paints these figurines to this day</p>
<p>and I love working with him on them.</p>
<p>And I myself have done some wargaming.</p>
<p>I was a big sort of Warhammer fan as well.</p>
<p>And so it is interesting how that sort of transmitted through.</p>
<p>And then from Age of Empires,</p>
<p>I learned the stories of these key figures,</p>
<p>some better than others, as we both know,</p>
<p>with regards to Charlemagne.</p>
<p>But I then started playing other historical games</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s actually the first first-person shooter game</p>
<p>I started playing.</p>
<p>It was a game called Battlefield 1942,</p>
<p>obviously a World War II game,</p>
<p>not dissimilar to our own.</p>
<p>And then Call of Duty, which was a World War II game as well.</p>
<p>And in those games,</p>
<p>I just picked up this extreme interest in World War II</p>
<p>as a period, as an historical period,</p>
<p>and all the interesting things that took place within it,</p>
<p>obviously, and all the tragedy within it as well.</p>
<p>But it was this direct transmission</p>
<p>from wargaming to video gaming.</p>
<p>And then a lot of that has then shaped</p>
<p>and directly inspired what we&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>at my company with our game.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also inspired the way</p>
<p>that we try and capture these events as well.</p>
<p>Because just as I learned something,</p>
<p>approximating the historical record</p>
<p>through the games that came before,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to kind of pay that service</p>
<p>to the people who end up engaging with our game.</p>
<p>So I definitely think there&rsquo;s a direct transmission through there.</p>
<p>And I think as well, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re seeing war movies and historical movies</p>
<p>particularly take a backseat to other genres of films.</p>
<p>I think the superhero genre</p>
<p>has sort of become the new war movie genre, if you like.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s obviously exceptions to that rule.</p>
<p>But I think more and more so now,</p>
<p>young people especially are engaging</p>
<p>with history through games.</p>
<p>And so we see ourselves in a small way</p>
<p>able to contribute to some kind of understanding</p>
<p>of these conflicts.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, I must be closer to your dad&rsquo;s age</p>
<p>because I also have thousands of those miniature figures</p>
<p>that I painted myself from the old days that I still have.</p>
<p>I also remember the very first computer I ever bought,</p>
<p>I bought for only one reason,</p>
<p>and that was there was a game called</p>
<p>The Ancient Art of War that I had to play.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re talking about the mid-1980s here.</p>
<p>So as a guy who had been in the,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call it the analog world of war gaming,</p>
<p>the potential to take that into the realm of computer games</p>
<p>was absolutely, I mean,</p>
<p>probably the first 15 computer games I ever owned</p>
<p>were all war games or variations of war games.</p>
<p>And in fact, one of my favorite ones to play right now,</p>
<p>the Field of Glory games,</p>
<p>are all nothing more than an attempt</p>
<p>by somebody who certainly played those same games</p>
<p>with miniature figures like I did to take that game</p>
<p>and turn it into an actual computer game</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t need to worry about finding opponents.</p>
<p>As you know from your dad&rsquo;s experience,</p>
<p>the hobby itself is an, it&rsquo;s a hardcore hobby</p>
<p>in the sense that there&rsquo;s almost an obsession to it.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re a young person,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an extremely expensive hobby to break into.</p>
<p>The entry level requirements are huge.</p>
<p>Whereas with a computer game,</p>
<p>it is, you know, maybe under the Christmas tree,</p>
<p>you can have it there and then all of a sudden</p>
<p>without any more investment than that,</p>
<p>you can become somebody who&rsquo;s learning about the past</p>
<p>through an immersive sort of an experience.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I definitely do see the similarities.</p>
<p>Can you talk to me a little bit, not shifting gears here,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m interested in the game</p>
<p>and trying to figure out how you deal with,</p>
<p>you know, the Second World War</p>
<p>is famously more of a good guy, bad guy war.</p>
<p>If you go to the First World War,</p>
<p>you can do a much better, I think, example</p>
<p>where anybody could potentially be the good guys</p>
<p>depending on the point of view you have.</p>
<p>How does one incorporate, especially since, as you said,</p>
<p>you lack the ability to incorporate</p>
<p>a heavy-duty narrative to the whole thing?</p>
<p>I mean, I guess I&rsquo;m just thinking</p>
<p>I would not be the kind of guy to play the German forces</p>
<p>just because of my own inherent biases.</p>
<p>How does that&hellip; I mean, and if you&rsquo;re doing Stalingrad,</p>
<p>some might make a case, and I think we did in a podcast once,</p>
<p>that from the American or the British point of view,</p>
<p>both those sides are necessarily fraught with&hellip;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the word I&rsquo;m looking for here?</p>
<p>Moral quandaries might be a good way to put it.</p>
<p>And I know that in Germany,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t show things like swastikas and all that.</p>
<p>How does one navigate the difficult terrain</p>
<p>of the morality in a war</p>
<p>that is so dominated by the moral questions?</p>
<p>That is&hellip;</p>
<p>You know, look, that&rsquo;s the key question</p>
<p>in so much as us coming to this subject matter.</p>
<p>It is certainly difficult,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s certainly one that we constantly think deeply about.</p>
<p>And obviously, I mean, so at a baseline,</p>
<p>we have removed all of the Nazi iconography within the game.</p>
<p>That means obscuring swastikas</p>
<p>and other imagery like that on uniforms and things.</p>
<p>So we have this incredibly difficult balance</p>
<p>of trying to give these soldiers the actual uniform they fought in,</p>
<p>which often is not what you would think it would look like.</p>
<p>I think everyone has an opinion of German soldiers</p>
<p>as wearing a red armband, obviously,</p>
<p>almost like a ceremonial outfit.</p>
<p>But a lot of them were wearing</p>
<p>sort of the equivalent of a wool jacket,</p>
<p>some pretty rough boots and obviously wool pants.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, we&rsquo;re trying to portray them</p>
<p>as they were ideally within the theatre that they were fighting</p>
<p>and as accurately as possible,</p>
<p>while also making sure that we don&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>You know, obviously, we abide by German law.</p>
<p>And then just out of sensitivity,</p>
<p>also obscure the swastika more generally.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also currently made the decision</p>
<p>that we won&rsquo;t be including the ability to dress as the SS in the game,</p>
<p>which you would think would be a very easy decision to make.</p>
<p>But for a lot of sort of the historical purists,</p>
<p>people get into all sorts of difficult conversations about,</p>
<p>well, what do you do about the NKVD?</p>
<p>You know, obviously, Stalin&rsquo;s secret police.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>As you said, they themselves did not have clean hands.</p>
<p>And then obviously, you then have another portion of people</p>
<p>who might say, okay, they agree that both the Nazis</p>
<p>and some elements of the Soviet forces engaged in this stuff,</p>
<p>but what about the British in this location</p>
<p>or the Americans in this location or so on and so forth?</p>
<p>So it does become an extremely, again,</p>
<p>a very difficult kind of landscape to manoeuvre through.</p>
<p>We try to do it with sensitivity</p>
<p>by obviously removing specific imagery</p>
<p>alongside also wanting to do that to comply with German law.</p>
<p>We try, I think we&rsquo;ve avoided thus far,</p>
<p>including other types of imagery, the hammer and sickle and things like that.</p>
<p>When it comes to the actual in-field,</p>
<p>the on-the-battlefield type experience,</p>
<p>I mean, no part of the game is set up</p>
<p>to enable you to do anything other</p>
<p>than just sort of play the game against another force.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have any civilians on the battlefield.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have anything that could add or give players an opportunity</p>
<p>to have questionable elements, let&rsquo;s just say.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just very keen to focus you</p>
<p>on the frontline combat experience of those soldiers.</p>
<p>And I think the kind of conundrum we&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>is that if you didn&rsquo;t want to portray any morally questionable people,</p>
<p>I mean, morally questionable people within war,</p>
<p>you really can&rsquo;t portray it at all.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to give a sort of cop-out answer there, but I mean&hellip;</p>
<p>No, no, I actually agree. I agree with that, actually.</p>
<p>Yeah. And so obviously, well, okay,</p>
<p>so if we either can&rsquo;t portray it at all or we can portray it,</p>
<p>then how sensitively do we try to portray it?</p>
<p>And for us, as I kind of touched on earlier,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really about the strategic and tactical competitive elements of this</p>
<p>rather than any of the ideology associated with it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not present anywhere in the game.</p>
<p>I think the strongest thing that we&rsquo;ve got in the game</p>
<p>is some of the writing on the wall,</p>
<p>the graffiti that some of the Soviet soldiers wrote in Stalingrad</p>
<p>that was sort of denouncing fascists.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s about as political as we&rsquo;ve got in the game.</p>
<p>And that was largely as set dressing</p>
<p>because it was so iconic within Stalingrad</p>
<p>you just saw tonnes of posters everywhere</p>
<p>and tonnes of graffiti everywhere</p>
<p>of these soldiers trading insults back and forth.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s kind of as close as we&rsquo;ve got to depicting anything,</p>
<p>especially ideological, within the game.</p>
<p>Obviously, one could argue that depicting them at all is ideological,</p>
<p>but as we&rsquo;ve said, you know, we would really&hellip;</p>
<p>You would then create a situation</p>
<p>where you really could never depict historical events to some degree.</p>
<p>I think it becomes very difficult.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m of two minds about this, though,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the same thing with the violence.</p>
<p>And I haven&rsquo;t thought about it anywhere near as long as you have,</p>
<p>but the same side of me that suggests that maybe uber-violence</p>
<p>and treating this as realistic as possible</p>
<p>helps eliminate some of the downside.</p>
<p>I feel the same way about, like,</p>
<p>when we would have World War II&hellip;</p>
<p>Second World War is always the way I&hellip;</p>
<p>When we were having Second World War tank battles back in the 1970s,</p>
<p>I guarantee you people painted swastikas on the top of their tanks</p>
<p>for aircraft recognition, as was done.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a part of me that thinks that&hellip;</p>
<p>And I understand from a corporate standpoint</p>
<p>and German law and all those other things, you have really no choice.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a part of me that thinks that perhaps&hellip;</p>
<p>And I can go both ways, because most people, you could say,</p>
<p>would not be affected negatively</p>
<p>by incorporating hammer and sickles or swastikas or all those things.</p>
<p>But the same small group of people</p>
<p>that might be negatively affected by being able to go around</p>
<p>shooting other virtual human beings</p>
<p>might be affected by having swastikas and playing the SS.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know if you can create whole game systems</p>
<p>based on what two or three or four percent of the users might react,</p>
<p>you know, in opposition to the way everybody else reacts.</p>
<p>I think most people would be fine with all those other things.</p>
<p>And I think it might be a more faithful example of history</p>
<p>I mean, to incorporate a Nazi German army</p>
<p>and not show swastikas seems weird, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I understand why it doesn&rsquo;t happen,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a part of you that goes,</p>
<p>well, if we&rsquo;re trying to teach about the war</p>
<p>and if we&rsquo;re trying to make this an introduction</p>
<p>to a fascinating period in human history,</p>
<p>which involves some of these extreme ideologies,</p>
<p>if you take the extreme ideologies out,</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t you left this giant black hole</p>
<p>that is a huge part of the reason</p>
<p>that this fighting is happening to begin with?</p>
<p>I mean, it is a really tough thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen similar discussions when it came to the immersive</p>
<p>virtual reality experience connected to realism,</p>
<p>whereas as a certain point it becomes</p>
<p>how do you create a faithful reproduction</p>
<p>of a negative human experience,</p>
<p>but not so much that it turns people off</p>
<p>from wanting to participate in it?</p>
<p>And so I think there&rsquo;s this fine line you guys have to walk</p>
<p>and then you add the corporate thing</p>
<p>and then you add the German law kind of thing.</p>
<p>But it does seem like there would be something inherently missing</p>
<p>in an ideological war if you take out the ideology.</p>
<p>It seems like you guys would have to design around&hellip;</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;m having a real admiration</p>
<p>for your ability to design around those issues.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re 100% correct, though,</p>
<p>in so much as if we are trying to portray things</p>
<p>as best we can according to the historical record.</p>
<p>I mean, I come at it in two minds</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure you do the same.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve already just said that you do.</p>
<p>The swastika is, I would argue,</p>
<p>one of the most powerful icons in human history,</p>
<p>at least modern human history.</p>
<p>Nearly everyone in the world knows what that symbol means</p>
<p>and the suffering it caused</p>
<p>and the suffering that it continues to cause</p>
<p>and the echoes of it through history.</p>
<p>And so to show it is&hellip;</p>
<p>To show it will evoke a response either way</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d be concerned if someone didn&rsquo;t have a response to seeing it.</p>
<p>And the same can be said for other symbols, of course,</p>
<p>but the swastika is a uniquely&hellip;</p>
<p>or a near uniquely powerful one</p>
<p>within the time and history that we find ourselves.</p>
<p>From our perspective,</p>
<p>the way that we&rsquo;ve sort of felt about it</p>
<p>is that our purpose as the type of game that we are,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not a single-player game, we&rsquo;re unable to tell a story,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re unable to guide the player through narrative,</p>
<p>means that we don&rsquo;t have the ability</p>
<p>to kind of give it the proper context that we think it needs.</p>
<p>And as a result, we are happy to slightly obscure it within our game</p>
<p>because we are focused, at the end of the day,</p>
<p>the object of the game is to manoeuvre across the battlefield</p>
<p>using all the weaponry in the same uniforms,</p>
<p>both Allied and Axis forces,</p>
<p>in order to achieve a tactical strategic victory over the other force.</p>
<p>And so we felt that, you know, look, this isn&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re not going to attempt to tell the story at all,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re best to err on the side of caution.</p>
<p>And maybe we might be wrong in that, you know.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure as well that many people will know</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s always a line where you can draw that.</p>
<p>I mean, you could say, well, why have them dressed up as German soldiers at all?</p>
<p>Or, you know, there&rsquo;s always a line,</p>
<p>and that is 100%, I think, subjective.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no objective rule to this, and that&rsquo;s extremely tough for us</p>
<p>because, boy, would life be easier if there was an objective rule?</p>
<p>But, yeah, it is subjective,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of the approach that we&rsquo;ve taken,</p>
<p>is that if our object is not to tell the full story of this,</p>
<p>you know, of this conflict ideologically,</p>
<p>then, you know, I think we&rsquo;re better to err on the side of caution with this.</p>
<p>How does the user base feel?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s one thing for the people in the corporate side of things</p>
<p>to worry about all these things, because that&rsquo;s your job.</p>
<p>But the people who are only concerned with either the fun element</p>
<p>or the competitive element or the historical element</p>
<p>or all of those wrapped up together</p>
<p>who give you the feedback on things you can change</p>
<p>or things they&rsquo;re not happy with or what should be in the next version,</p>
<p>do they have an opinion one way or the other?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure swastikas and hammers and sickles</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things have been raised before.</p>
<p>Is there an opinion out there one way or the other from them?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, I wouldn&rsquo;t say there&rsquo;s a majority opinion.</p>
<p>I would actually say that the historical, the more historical,</p>
<p>or more historically oriented people, I should say,</p>
<p>or the purists within our particular community</p>
<p>tend to focus much more on battlefield history</p>
<p>rather than ideological history.</p>
<p>There are some people, I would say it&rsquo;s probably less than 1%,</p>
<p>who would really like to see it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very important to them that you capture the full picture</p>
<p>with the inclusion of swastikas or the SS.</p>
<p>But I would say, actually, that more of the historical feedback</p>
<p>that we get is more around some of the concessions</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had to make due to it being a video game</p>
<p>rather than any kind of ideological censorship.</p>
<p>So the things that they&rsquo;re concerned with are more like,</p>
<p>exactly as you said, the turret rotation speed on particular tanks.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re concerned about, within our game,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had a preponderance of automatic weapons.</p>
<p>Sorry, we&rsquo;ve had probably a few too many automatic weapons</p>
<p>on the side of the Germans at the unit level,</p>
<p>which they would love us to kind of dial back,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to make a move to dial back</p>
<p>and keep it more focused around the Kar98k,</p>
<p>which is the German bolt-action rifle,</p>
<p>which was the weapon the majority of soldiers used.</p>
<p>So a lot of the sort of historical-oriented criticism,</p>
<p>I think, comes down to more of the battlefield</p>
<p>and the strategic and the tactical elements</p>
<p>rather than anything kind of ideological,</p>
<p>which is interesting, but I suppose,</p>
<p>now that I think about it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s suiting to what we&rsquo;re actually trying to capture as an end outcome.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is you wouldn&rsquo;t have any of these problems</p>
<p>in the majority of conflicts in human history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the nature of the Second World War</p>
<p>and maybe some of the conflicts during the Cold War</p>
<p>that happened after that.</p>
<p>Those are the only ones I can think of</p>
<p>that would give you any trouble at all.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re going back to Genghis Khan&rsquo;s conquest,</p>
<p>none of this enters into the equation at all.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re actually getting trapped in the creases</p>
<p>of the leftover ideological and moral fumes</p>
<p>of that conflict itself, aren&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly right.</p>
<p>And I never want to be insensitive,</p>
<p>I mean, in so much as you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>like there aren&rsquo;t a lot of sort of,</p>
<p>I think it was ancient Mesopotamia</p>
<p>or the location of modern-day Iraq</p>
<p>that Genghis Khan sacked.</p>
<p>He sacked a lot of places.</p>
<p>He sacked a lot of places.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>If there was one thing he was very good at,</p>
<p>it was death and destruction.</p>
<p>But no, I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the proximity to this.</p>
<p>And I think also, I mean,</p>
<p>even just in diving so much into the history,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve really been so saturated in World War II history,</p>
<p>there is something unique about the forces at play.</p>
<p>I mean, all of them are ideologically very different,</p>
<p>roughly sort of capitalist, communist, fascist.</p>
<p>And, I mean, there&rsquo;s just something</p>
<p>extremely, not outlandish,</p>
<p>but eccentric about them,</p>
<p>and particularly the German forces,</p>
<p>naming their vehicles after sort of predatory animals.</p>
<p>It just, the fact that this terrifying tank</p>
<p>was called the Tiger Tank,</p>
<p>whereas sort of the Americans obviously</p>
<p>named them after generals.</p>
<p>There were these decisions</p>
<p>that heightened that ideological difference.</p>
<p>And then obviously, you know,</p>
<p>the extremity of the Nazi ideology,</p>
<p>and the extremity, obviously,</p>
<p>you look at sort of Holodomor</p>
<p>and the famines within Soviet Russia,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just such a huge scale of human suffering,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s such a recent event, really,</p>
<p>relative, obviously, to Khan,</p>
<p>that I think, yeah, we are,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still, you know,</p>
<p>sensitivity is required to handle these issues.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re right, I mean,</p>
<p>I think obviously people have political differences</p>
<p>about the US involvement in Vietnam,</p>
<p>and depicting a Vietnam War conflict,</p>
<p>but far, far, far less fraught,</p>
<p>and far, far, far less clear-cut on the surface</p>
<p>than obviously World War II.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tough one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an extremely tough one.</p>
<p>And obviously all war to some degree,</p>
<p>you know, and the way that we view them</p>
<p>is written by the victors.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s very difficult to say that,</p>
<p>yeah, it&rsquo;s very difficult to inject more nuance</p>
<p>into a conversation about World War II.</p>
<p>I think some people might say</p>
<p>that those very questions are what makes it so compelling.</p>
<p>So I think that it&rsquo;s all wrapped up</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;s all wrapped up into this package</p>
<p>that is the Second World War,</p>
<p>and the fact that I had somebody say to me</p>
<p>that they thought that the Second World War</p>
<p>was more interesting than the First World War,</p>
<p>specifically because of the ideological questions</p>
<p>that we were just discussing.</p>
<p>So before I let you go,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;d like to know,</p>
<p>just as a guy who&rsquo;s an expert in the field,</p>
<p>I remember playing the ancient art of war in the 1980s,</p>
<p>and the difference between that</p>
<p>and what you&rsquo;re putting out is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not one generation, it&rsquo;s multi-generations.</p>
<p>Where do you see this going in like 10 years,</p>
<p>15 years?</p>
<p>Any clues on what lies around the development bend?</p>
<p>Look, this is, I wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s a million dollar question,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably a trillion dollar question for the industry.</p>
<p>And I think that depending on your outlook,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s either utopian or dystopian to some degree.</p>
<p>And obviously the truth nearly always lies</p>
<p>somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>I think that we&rsquo;ll start to see virtual reality</p>
<p>come into play, as I said earlier,</p>
<p>if they solve sort of the delivery issue,</p>
<p>the ability for people to play it</p>
<p>without having to pay a huge amount of money.</p>
<p>We will very quickly start to see</p>
<p>people playing our type of game in VR space,</p>
<p>in 3D, moving your body around,</p>
<p>actually having to hold a weapon up.</p>
<p>I mean, I think more generally and more broadly,</p>
<p>video games is in an explosion of growth at the moment</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re seeing a generation</p>
<p>that grew up with them age through the population.</p>
<p>So obviously, many generations currently</p>
<p>never ever had games when they were younger.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re seeing this,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re seeing what it looks like for the first time,</p>
<p>for instance, for people of all ages,</p>
<p>for instance, to read books.</p>
<p>And so much as there was a time a long time ago</p>
<p>where books were the new thing,</p>
<p>or television was a new thing,</p>
<p>or film was the new thing.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;re seeing with video games</p>
<p>is an advancing generation of people</p>
<p>who grew up with them.</p>
<p>And so I think that it&rsquo;s only going to get bigger.</p>
<p>But I also think that it places huge burden</p>
<p>of responsibility on people making</p>
<p>these sort of digital environments</p>
<p>to safeguard or try and build systems</p>
<p>that people enjoy, that don&rsquo;t exploit them,</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>trying to present the best form of entertainment that we can</p>
<p>in as ethical a way as we can</p>
<p>and try and figure out what that looks like</p>
<p>when more and more people&rsquo;s time is spent</p>
<p>in these digital environments.</p>
<p>So I know that sounds sort of very kind of doomsaying</p>
<p>if you think about it from the perspective</p>
<p>of everyone spending tons and tons of hours</p>
<p>playing video games.</p>
<p>But I also think that, you know,</p>
<p>video games have amazing potential</p>
<p>to connect people who might be struggling,</p>
<p>you know, perhaps to make friends</p>
<p>in their physical surroundings.</p>
<p>People connect with each other online.</p>
<p>They share great memories online.</p>
<p>They get to know each other more and more and more.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing virtual reality experiences</p>
<p>enable people to exercise within VR.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s not uncommon now</p>
<p>for people to meet their future husband</p>
<p>and wife or partner online in games.</p>
<p>So it is extremely varied.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s all moving faster</p>
<p>than anyone can really keep up with.</p>
<p>But I definitely think that VR is probably</p>
<p>the place to watch because as soon as,</p>
<p>if anyone&rsquo;s ever tried that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s quite an experience.</p>
<p>And it can often trick you psychologically.</p>
<p>Your eyes can kind of deceive you, obviously.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll be very, very interesting</p>
<p>to see what kind of experiences move into VR,</p>
<p>whether, you know, it&rsquo;s shooting games</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s strategy games.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;ll be all of them,</p>
<p>but which really pick up with the players.</p>
<p>So, look, it&rsquo;s, yeah, it&rsquo;s a big road ahead.</p>
<p>And I just, you know, I&rsquo;ll be working</p>
<p>and I think many people will to try</p>
<p>and make it the best experience possible,</p>
<p>whatever that looks like.</p>
<p>I think this blends nicely into the overall question</p>
<p>of the development of war games in the modern era.</p>
<p>And if you could have told me in the mid 1970s</p>
<p>that someday this would be,</p>
<p>I mean, like I said, I went and bought a computer</p>
<p>just so I could play a game</p>
<p>that looks like it&rsquo;s tic-tac-toe</p>
<p>compared to the games out there now.</p>
<p>So, I appreciate you taking the time</p>
<p>to answer these really tough questions</p>
<p>and to bring us sort of into the development room</p>
<p>a little bit and help us understand</p>
<p>the kinds of things that you guys were talking over.</p>
<p>And I can speak from experience</p>
<p>that that was exact same kinds of conversations</p>
<p>we had designing the first World War game</p>
<p>is these trade-offs, these morally ambiguous areas,</p>
<p>how you portray negative things</p>
<p>and how faithful you have to be to stuff</p>
<p>so that you&rsquo;re not giving a fake or imprecise</p>
<p>or something that&rsquo;s a fantasy of a reality,</p>
<p>if that makes sense,</p>
<p>showing something that&rsquo;s actually a fantasy game</p>
<p>portraying itself as history.</p>
<p>And I think trying to get it right</p>
<p>is actually the key to the whole thing.</p>
<p>The one thing we didn&rsquo;t talk about,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s worth just bringing up here at the very end,</p>
<p>is the interplay between all of the other people.</p>
<p>One of the things you&rsquo;d mentioned to me</p>
<p>was the fact that a lot of people in this game</p>
<p>are actually not tip-of-the-spear people,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re actually showing how many people are involved</p>
<p>in keeping the logistics going.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d mentioned teamwork,</p>
<p>and I think that conjures up this idea of,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;ll go around this hill,</p>
<p>you go around this other side,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve actually got people</p>
<p>sort of operating in the supply chain, too, don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>I think, as I sort of said a little bit earlier</p>
<p>about this sort of ageing generation of gamers,</p>
<p>myself being right there,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re younger,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re extremely good at the twitch mechanics</p>
<p>of your twitch fibers, the muscles,</p>
<p>enable you to track things</p>
<p>with your hand-to-eye coordination</p>
<p>at incredible rates.</p>
<p>And so a lot of video games</p>
<p>were thought to be sort of the fare of young people,</p>
<p>and then you sort of grow out of them.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;ve kind of seen</p>
<p>is that as gamers have aged,</p>
<p>the types of things that stimulate us</p>
<p>and interest us sort of age with us, obviously,</p>
<p>which seems obvious now,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think it has been, really.</p>
<p>And so as a result of this,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve started to see an uptick in games like ours</p>
<p>in so much as we move the experience away</p>
<p>from just the hand-to-eye coordination,</p>
<p>the success of that,</p>
<p>to sort of strategy, planning,</p>
<p>talking to one another, communicating,</p>
<p>and really weighting success more towards that.</p>
<p>So, yeah, for instance, in our game,</p>
<p>you can sort of drive supplies around.</p>
<p>Most of the game drops supplies off.</p>
<p>People can build infrastructure.</p>
<p>And as we know, all wars are fought</p>
<p>by the people in the rear echelon,</p>
<p>by the supply chain.</p>
<p>The Red Bull Express, I think, was the famous</p>
<p>U.S. supply chain with the GMC trucks.</p>
<p>And so, I mean, also, I mean,</p>
<p>it ties nicely into sort of where we think this will go.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be shocked to see these systems expand.</p>
<p>So you may end up, you know,</p>
<p>delivering ammunition or driving supplies</p>
<p>or giving ranges to the artillery</p>
<p>and never even firing your weapon.</p>
<p>You might use a binoculars to spot targets for the artillery.</p>
<p>And so this is sort of the way</p>
<p>the genre is expanding as well.</p>
<p>In so much as people really using</p>
<p>sort of their gray matter instead of just</p>
<p>sort of muscle and reflex and reaction.</p>
<p>Which I think is, you know, I think is really exciting.</p>
<p>I mean, as you know, so few people in war</p>
<p>actually proportionally fired their weapon</p>
<p>in anger at the enemy.</p>
<p>And so I think it&rsquo;s kind of interesting</p>
<p>from a historical perspective to&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly a far more realistic picture</p>
<p>to show that people actually had to deliver the ammo</p>
<p>to the frontline troops.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember what the stat was.</p>
<p>I think it was something like 15% of frontline&hellip;</p>
<p>of troops made up the frontline.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different in every army.</p>
<p>Yeah, 17 to one in the US in the Second World War,</p>
<p>I think it was.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, though.</p>
<p>You got me thinking of things I never thought about,</p>
<p>which is, for example, that my generation probably,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably a good age, I&rsquo;m 55.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the first generation who ever grew up with video games.</p>
<p>And so how do you write video games</p>
<p>to intrigue 55-year-olds, you know?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a whole different thing</p>
<p>than anyone had to worry about in the old days</p>
<p>when nobody over a certain age played computer games.</p>
<p>So, well, fascinating future in the offing for that.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>For the design for geriatric video game fun.</p>
<p>Well, you say that, but I mean,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really what I&rsquo;m thinking about.</p>
<p>I mean, I think it could be&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to say it too soon,</p>
<p>but it could be a very bright future for people, you know?</p>
<p>I think, you know, you look at sort of elderly people</p>
<p>and obviously isolation is tragic</p>
<p>and is really difficult for elderly people.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s difficult for everyone</p>
<p>and obviously even more so for elderly people.</p>
<p>And I do wonder what the experience</p>
<p>of being an elderly person would be like</p>
<p>if I was in constant communication with a group of friends.</p>
<p>A buddy of mine once said,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re never going to be the isolated older people</p>
<p>in the rest home.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to have much more to do</p>
<p>than people who just stared out the window all day.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>but certainly with things like this,</p>
<p>you could see that this doesn&rsquo;t have to be anything</p>
<p>that you ever have to give up entirely, necessarily.</p>
<p>If your health will let you do it.</p>
<p>Exactly. Yeah.</p>
<p>Max, thank you so much for coming on the program.</p>
<p>I wish you continued success with this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a heck of an achievement just to see visually</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re talking about here</p>
<p>and certainly to work through all of the ins and outs</p>
<p>of the questions we&rsquo;ve been discussing here.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for coming on the show.</p>
<p>Oh, thanks so much, Dan.</p>
<p>And I mean, just a huge, huge fan.</p>
<p>So this is just a wonderful, wonderful chance</p>
<p>and fantastic questions and a great chat.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me on.</p>
<p>Anytime. Take care, buddy.</p>
<p>That was a fun trip sort of down wargaming memory lane for me.</p>
<p>If you were interested, by the way, in Hell Let Loose,</p>
<p>want to know more about it,</p>
<p>you can go to hellletloose.com.</p>
<p>And I said when we started the Hardcore History Addendum feed</p>
<p>that we were going to be able to use it as a way</p>
<p>to try to explore some more of these history-related tangents</p>
<p>at times or very sort of niche history.</p>
<p>For example, I am going to do a boxing show someday.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do a punk rock show someday.</p>
<p>And I realize that&rsquo;s not sort of an appeal</p>
<p>to the entire audience,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m hoping that when we someday have an archive,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how old I&rsquo;ll have to be given my release pace,</p>
<p>but an archive of a bunch of Hardcore History Addendum shows,</p>
<p>some will be crowd-pleasers across the board</p>
<p>and others will be these ones where,</p>
<p>you know, you probably would skip by,</p>
<p>but a person who&rsquo;s really interested in that subject</p>
<p>would be really jacked to have a conversation.</p>
<p>You know, we always used to joke</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no place in broadcasting</p>
<p>for people who are interested in 1950s Spanish language</p>
<p>science fiction comic books.</p>
<p>But if somebody did a podcast or a show about that,</p>
<p>you know how jacked they&rsquo;d be to have something</p>
<p>so narrowly targeted to their interest.</p>
<p>So, I kind of feel like I want to throw some of those shows</p>
<p>into the addendum feed.</p>
<p>In any case,</p>
<p>if you want to stay on top of</p>
<p>whenever we manage to get something out,</p>
<p>make sure you follow us on Twitter at AtHardcoreHistory,</p>
<p>and I hope to be talking to you all again soon.</p>
<p>Stay safe, everyone.</p>
