    <p>This is an incredible fashion disaster.</p>
<p>We have to be David Sachs is dressed like where&rsquo;s Waldo.</p>
<p>OK, Friedberg, Friedberg is dressed like</p>
<p>driving a fucking Subaru Outback.</p>
<p>Oh, God. Unbelievable.</p>
<p>I mean, this is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride</p>
<p>Rain Man, David Sachs.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s said we open source it to the fans</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>And I mean, we know</p>
<p>everybody, everybody.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another episode of the all in podcast.</p>
<p>Episode 31 with us today from.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s just rolled out of bed.</p>
<p>The queen of Kenwa himself, David Friedberg is here.</p>
<p>Let me do my only get that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to help.</p>
<p>Have you been studying the homeless problem by by yourself</p>
<p>going out on the streets or what?</p>
<p>The Friedberg.</p>
<p>Do we need to do an intervention?</p>
<p>All right. I&rsquo;m going to go change.</p>
<p>Give me a five minute.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>The Friedberg minutes up.</p>
<p>We have to keep the Friedberg ratio up.</p>
<p>I had somebody stop me in Miami and say, keep the Friedberg ratio high.</p>
<p>Also with us chiming in is where&rsquo;s Waldo himself.</p>
<p>The skipper David Sachs, the Rain Man is here.</p>
<p>The skipper is here.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t change my name.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t change my nickname.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m comfortable with Rain Man. Don&rsquo;t throw me off.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>Definitely OK with Rain Man.</p>
<p>Of course, not the skipper, not the skipper.</p>
<p>And the dictator himself got a full night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>I hope this time I did.</p>
<p>Jamal Khaliha Patea.</p>
<p>And of course, I&rsquo;m Jake, how the baby seal here.</p>
<p>In Miami, look at the view, how beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been an incredible, incredible week.</p>
<p>The tiger has been unleashed.</p>
<p>I went to Austin.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m in Miami.</p>
<p>Jake, you&rsquo;re more like you&rsquo;re more you&rsquo;re more like a pudgy hyena.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not really a tiger.</p>
<p>The quarantine 15 big announcement.</p>
<p>10 pounds are gone. Five to go.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m lifting weights outside in Miami.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been amazing.</p>
<p>Field report. I get to Austin.</p>
<p>I kid you not.</p>
<p>I got my mask on.</p>
<p>10 people, first of all, 10 people say I love the all in podcast.</p>
<p>Every like 15 feet walking in Austin and in Miami.</p>
<p>But somebody looks at me with my mask and says, are you OK, son?</p>
<p>And I was like, what?</p>
<p>I kid you not.</p>
<p>And he said, are you vaccinated?</p>
<p>And I said, yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, why are you wearing a mask?</p>
<p>And I realized it&rsquo;s time for independent critical thinking.</p>
<p>Sax, I got to give it to you.</p>
<p>Another great, great tweet for me to copy and adapt to steal your deal.</p>
<p>But I love this tweet that you had where you said early in the pandemic,</p>
<p>explain the tweet or maybe read the tweet.</p>
<p>This is well, which one?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been blasting masks about one group of people wouldn&rsquo;t wear masks.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, at the beginning, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I mean, the the dysfunction of our politics is that half the country</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t wear a mask at the beginning of the pandemic.</p>
<p>And now the other half of the country won&rsquo;t take them off at its end.</p>
<p>This is the problem, is that the mask has become</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the equivalent of the red MAGA hat for Team Blue.</p>
<p>This has become some sort of virtue signaling,</p>
<p>even when it&rsquo;s not necessary.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s actually destructive because it&rsquo;s performatively</p>
<p>sending the signal to people that the vaccines don&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And we have a third of the country today is still vaccine hesitant.</p>
<p>And this is not helping.</p>
<p>What we need to be sending the message to them is, look, get vaccinated</p>
<p>so life can get back to normal so you don&rsquo;t have to wear a mask.</p>
<p>And, you know, we still have the CDC putting out this ridiculously</p>
<p>conservative and timid guidance saying that, well,</p>
<p>if you get vaccinated, you can take off your mask outdoors</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re not with too many people.</p>
<p>Well, like what?</p>
<p>No. I mean, look, once you get vaccinated,</p>
<p>you should need to wear a mask outdoors or indoors.</p>
<p>And, you know, we had the state, this sort of mini</p>
<p>State of the Union this past week with Biden.</p>
<p>And it was this really like nobody was there.</p>
<p>No, it was like an empty room.</p>
<p>Empty room because of social distancing.</p>
<p>And they were all wearing masks, even though, you know,</p>
<p>every single one of them is vaccinated.</p>
<p>And so I think Biden really missed an opportunity in that speech.</p>
<p>Yes, he said that everyone should get vaccinated, but show not tell.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, he walks up to the microphone in a mask</p>
<p>saying that we should all get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Well, what is the mask for?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you tell people that if you get vaccinated,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need a mask anymore?</p>
<p>And so, you know, we have this sort of contrast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually really it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s really incredible, because to your point,</p>
<p>he was trying to make some very important points in that speech, David.</p>
<p>And when the camera would actually pan from behind him.</p>
<p>So instead of looking at him and Kamala and Nancy Pelosi, it would look</p>
<p>there was nine people.</p>
<p>And you thought another sold out crowd for.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, because because no, no, no, because typically</p>
<p>when when you give these sort of State of the Union or, you know,</p>
<p>these kind of like a hundred day addresses, it is packed</p>
<p>because you have everybody in Congress.</p>
<p>You have everybody in the Senate.</p>
<p>You know, you have you have typically like a bunch of other officials.</p>
<p>You have a Supreme Court judge, like in a State of the Union address.</p>
<p>And there was nobody.</p>
<p>And it felt really striking to watch that.</p>
<p>If Trump&rsquo;s mistake was not wearing a mask in April of 2020,</p>
<p>I think Biden&rsquo;s mistake is not taking it off in April of 2021.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t we get a political leader</p>
<p>who is willing to put on masks at the right time and take them off?</p>
<p>Or do risk assessment?</p>
<p>Just we need a political leader who&rsquo;s reasonably scientific</p>
<p>and will actually say, here&rsquo;s the intersection of science</p>
<p>and common sense that everybody can map to and copy me,</p>
<p>because it is to your point, David, you know, the leader of the free world</p>
<p>is given that title for a reason.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not complete, completely ignore what I say.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been put in this position because I am, you know, on some dimension.</p>
<p>expected to be the most thoughtful person in the room and set the example for everybody.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just talk like the important consequence of this.</p>
<p>And I agree with sex.</p>
<p>The important consequence of this, however, is the economic effect it has.</p>
<p>So for example, in San Francisco, restaurants are only allowed to be at a quarter capacity.</p>
<p>So there are restaurant owners that want to get back to business that want to generate income</p>
<p>again, that want to get off of the PPP loan program and all of the government support.</p>
<p>And they should be able to because most people in San Francisco at this point,</p>
<p>the vast majority, in fact, are vaccinated.</p>
<p>And the restaurants, for no scientific reason, are shut down or limited to a quarter capacity.</p>
<p>And this is the case across a lot of cities and a lot of states in the country right now,</p>
<p>where the conservatism with respect to coming out of the, you know,</p>
<p>the major part of this kind of pandemic is what&rsquo;s now keeping the economy or</p>
<p>not just keeping the economy because we&rsquo;re fueling the economy with stimulus,</p>
<p>but is keeping business owners and keeping people that want to participate actively</p>
<p>in building and running their businesses from getting back to work,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re so conservative about this.</p>
<p>And you know what, sex is totally right.</p>
<p>Yeah, like, take the masks off, let people go into restaurants and let people go have</p>
<p>dinner in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Let these places get back to work.</p>
<p>By the way, we have a we have an A B test.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually nobody&rsquo;s talking about, which is that</p>
<p>the more conservative version of America&rsquo;s posture, right?</p>
<p>America is sort of like half we don&rsquo;t care and half we care too much.</p>
<p>But in Europe, you could see a more, you know, homogeneous approach to the problem.</p>
<p>And we printed a negative 0.6% GDP growth in Europe.</p>
<p>So to your point, with all the vaccines that are out there with all of the logic and all</p>
<p>of the science, not being able to just take the mask off and get back to life as normal was</p>
<p>negative 0.6% GDP growth in a quarter, where they also printed hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>
<p>And now you come into the United States last year, I don&rsquo;t know if you guys remember this,</p>
<p>but every forecast I saw had GD from the smartest folks saying q1 GDP would be on a run rate to be</p>
<p>around 10%.</p>
<p>It would be one of the best in history.</p>
<p>It was only 1.6%.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re on a 6.4% GDP growth run rate.</p>
<p>Guys, that&rsquo;s not 10%.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s still a lot.</p>
<p>But the point is, we got to get back to life as normal, we have to show that these vaccines</p>
<p>work, we have to tell people that you can have a normal life, you should be going out</p>
<p>spending money going back to the office live normally.</p>
<p>Yeah, and we should we should we should just cover the data.</p>
<p>I mean, we should I mean, it&rsquo;d be great to put up the latest CDC data on the screen.</p>
<p>Yeah, if you use the CDC as a source for the data, as opposed to listening to their</p>
<p>interpretations of it, their policy interpretation, it&rsquo;s actually pretty illuminating.</p>
<p>So out of 87 million people who&rsquo;ve been vaccinated, there have only been 408 serious cases,</p>
<p>which would be count as hospitalization or death related to COVID.</p>
<p>So those are odds of one in 213,000.</p>
<p>The odds of being hit by lightning are one in 180,000.</p>
<p>So your odds of being struck by lightning are greater than your risk of getting seriously</p>
<p>sick.</p>
<p>What are the odds of a royal flush?</p>
<p>I need this in poker terms.</p>
<p>I think this sounds like hitting a royal flush twice.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>How many royal flushes have we each hit?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put it I&rsquo;ll put this article up and you guys can share it in the show notes.</p>
<p>The technology review one.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And I think it it does a good job of speaking to sexist statistic.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think sex I think this represents the CDC data in the first paragraph in this</p>
<p>article, but it goes on to kind of speak about the statistical likelihood of these events.</p>
<p>So, you know, basically, you know, it opens up by saying, you know, as of April 20 87</p>
<p>million people in the United States have been vaccinated and only 7157 or point</p>
<p>008% went on to become infected with SARS-CoV-2, 330 of whom were hospitalized and 77 of whom</p>
<p>died from the disease.</p>
<p>And I would guess that that of those people, there is likely some immune dysfunction,</p>
<p>which is a, you know, a likely reason why it doesn&rsquo;t mean that every individual has</p>
<p>that risk.</p>
<p>It means that there are certain people out there that are going to have immune dysfunction</p>
<p>and won&rsquo;t react well to won&rsquo;t develop the appropriate kind of protection from the vaccine.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, you know, that that&rsquo;s small, small, small, small, small percent of people</p>
<p>are the are where we&rsquo;re kind of seeing, you know, actual risk like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where I get the 408 number is it&rsquo;s the number of hospitalizations plus deaths</p>
<p>minus the ones that they say in the footnote were not related to COVID.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some other like cause.</p>
<p>So 408 out of 87 million.</p>
<p>And by the way, I think it&rsquo;s worth just highlighting, you know, just think about the</p>
<p>rationale for why there is conservatism here still, right.</p>
<p>So if there are still pockets where people have not been vaccinated in the country,</p>
<p>and there are still areas where people are hesitant to get vaccinated, and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>large unvaccinated population, the official guidance, the official kind of reasoning,</p>
<p>I believe, is that we need to be conservative to get all of those people to behave in a</p>
<p>conservative enough way to keep a, you know, a surge from occurring regionally around the</p>
<p>country, and the loss, the downside is very negligible, where people still have to wear</p>
<p>masks.</p>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t think that that calculus accounts for is that the loss is actually not negligible.</p>
<p>The loss of telling people broadly to keep wearing masks is a hesitancy to go back to</p>
<p>work a hesitancy and a conservancy to engage in normal economic activity.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I think that we&rsquo;re kind of missing that point in the kind of officiating</p>
<p>of this, of this exit strategy here.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s certainly I&rsquo;m aligned with sax on this, I certainly think it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s biting</p>
<p>us more than it&rsquo;s helping us to give you an idea, just like experience wise, when I was</p>
<p>in Austin, every restaurant is that 110 capacity, the locals, they were like, I can&rsquo;t get a</p>
<p>reservation for a week or two, the town is packed, everybody in the country is going</p>
<p>to Austin and Miami, because they&rsquo;ve just learned that Austin and Miami have officially</p>
<p>declared if you have the vaccine, you can go have your life.</p>
<p>But there is still a little bit of theater on the margins.</p>
<p>When you go into a restaurant, I went in to get a meal.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t have my mask on.</p>
<p>I kid you not 110 capacity, 100 people sitting at the bar, 200 people at tables.</p>
<p>She hands me a mask.</p>
<p>And I said, I&rsquo;ll have one I put it on.</p>
<p>I said, Can I ask you a question?</p>
<p>And she says, Why should you wear a mask when there&rsquo;s 300 people in here without a mask</p>
<p>and the doors are closed?</p>
<p>I was like, that&rsquo;s the exact question.</p>
<p>She goes, it makes no sense.</p>
<p>The governor wants no mess, the mayor wants masks.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re having their own little version of the national conversation in Austin, which</p>
<p>is locally scared, or at least the politicians are and then reasonable otherwise.</p>
<p>So you literally put your little mask on, you walk 10 feet to your table and then take</p>
<p>it off for the rest of the time in Miami.</p>
<p>I go to Miami, I walk into I you know, it was I haven&rsquo;t been out in 14 months.</p>
<p>So I decided I would check out a club.</p>
<p>And I went to a nightlife club.</p>
<p>And people were dancing and having a great time.</p>
<p>People were also popping bottles.</p>
<p>And I was like, Oh, my God, it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>Like, and nightlife club.</p>
<p>It was a nightlife club.</p>
<p>And no, it was not a Yes.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was a legitimate club, you know, here in South Beach.</p>
<p>And so I took a little Insta.</p>
<p>And I share I fed the Insta.</p>
<p>And immediately I got three comments from friends who are like, What are you doing in</p>
<p>that club?</p>
<p>And I wrote back to all three.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m vaccinated.</p>
<p>And they were like, Okay, I was like, is this obvious?</p>
<p>But I think this was the point I made a few months ago, which is I do think that the</p>
<p>subconscious training, the fear factor that&rsquo;s been kind of, you know, built into us over</p>
<p>the last year, year and a half.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna take a while to kind of train our way out of, you know, people aren&rsquo;t going</p>
<p>to be that rational and that conscious about Oh, I&rsquo;ve been vaccinated, people are basically</p>
<p>the default is fear, the what ifs, the buts, but oh, my God, people are still getting COVID,</p>
<p>even though they&rsquo;re vaccinated, but there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s variants, but and everyone looks for</p>
<p>a conscious or, you know, a kind of conscious reason why they&rsquo;re rationalizing their subconscious</p>
<p>fear.</p>
<p>And everyone&rsquo;s got this fear to go and do things and this fear to go back in the world,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve literally been trained and beaten into a corner for the last year.</p>
<p>Now, the conscious reality is, you don&rsquo;t need to be fearful, but I&rsquo;m fearful.</p>
<p>Therefore, I&rsquo;m looking for reasons to maintain my fear.</p>
<p>And I think this, this, this is like what I get, I say that I said it like four times</p>
<p>before, but this is what happened after 911.</p>
<p>And it lasted for years.</p>
<p>And you know, we still have ridiculous TSA processes, we need our leaders to take their</p>
<p>masks off, get tell everybody they&rsquo;re vaccinated, take their masks off, go back to normal life</p>
<p>so that everybody else will feel that it&rsquo;s okay, too.</p>
<p>Because even if you&rsquo;re, even if you&rsquo;re, if you&rsquo;re not fearful, David, the other thing</p>
<p>that you are is just guilty.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right, totally.</p>
<p>And you got to, you got to get rid of that as well.</p>
<p>And the only way you&rsquo;ll do it is if highly visible people are now actually going back</p>
<p>to life as normal.</p>
<p>Yeah, like the peer pressure element of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I feel bad, I feel bad going into a store when everyone else is wearing a mask.</p>
<p>And like, I&rsquo;m this crazy, this crazy MSNBC moment, one of the hosts of one of their shows</p>
<p>said, I&rsquo;ve been fully vaccinated, but I went running in Central Park.</p>
<p>So I double masked.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, the virtue signaling was so insane.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, wait a second, you&rsquo;re outdoors.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s insane.</p>
<p>This is the, this is the Joy Reid thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to say the person&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>Because then if you mention who it is, then you might be attacking a person of color or</p>
<p>a woman host.</p>
<p>So I just said.</p>
<p>Well, now you&rsquo;re avoiding it, which makes it think that you are.</p>
<p>So who is it?</p>
<p>How am I supposed to say it without being?</p>
<p>Does anybody want, I mean,</p>
<p>Nobody watches MSNBC.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>MSNBC was the Trump derangement syndrome therapy was MSNBC.</p>
<p>The ratings go.</p>
<p>I want to have a question for the three of you.</p>
<p>Knowing what we&rsquo;ve seen here, between the logic of both sides and the media and the</p>
<p>insanity, what do you take away from the year of the pandemic as it comes to a close in</p>
<p>how you personally look at the world?</p>
<p>Sachs, you want to start like,</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ll tell you.</p>
<p>I feel like the American people are constantly being propagandized.</p>
<p>And there is almost like an information war being perpetrated on the American people where</p>
<p>we cannot get the data, the facts and the truth.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s true now in terms of people not taking off their masks, even though we have</p>
<p>the CDC data that basically shows the lightning strike probability of getting COVID.</p>
<p>But we saw at the very beginning of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Remember, I have all these people on Twitter telling me every time I tweet about this.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you just listen to the experts, right?</p>
<p>They want me to shut off my brain and just do whatever the CDC says.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, well, do you realize the CDC was against masks at the beginning of the pandemic</p>
<p>back in March of 2000?</p>
<p>Last year, when I was saying we need to wear masks, because I was looking at the success</p>
<p>of the Asian countries and some of the data coming out of that.</p>
<p>The CDC was very, very slow in adopting masks.</p>
<p>They were against it.</p>
<p>They were telling us we didn&rsquo;t need to do it.</p>
<p>And that was the historical CDC, like, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been around for a long time.</p>
<p>And then also Trump was anti-mask.</p>
<p>And so you had</p>
<p>Trump was slow to adopt masks, too.</p>
<p>And yeah, and absolutely.</p>
<p>And so, yes, I mean, I&rsquo;ve said that there&rsquo;s like a Venn diagram of American politics,</p>
<p>where, you know, one circle is favored mask wearing one year ago, and then wants to get</p>
<p>rid of mask mandates today.</p>
<p>The Venn diagram of overlap between those two groups is very small.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in that overlap.</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m in like a very lonely part of the political graph.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Chamath, how has your thinking, you know, now that we&rsquo;ve had to process this event in</p>
<p>our lifetime, that is probably the most consequential, you know, moment?</p>
<p>Yeah, I have, I have, I&rsquo;ve thought about this a lot.</p>
<p>Jason, you asked a really important question.</p>
<p>And I think everybody should probably try to take five minutes and actually write this</p>
<p>down.</p>
<p>Because I think I&rsquo;ll tell you what I learned.</p>
<p>I learned, I learned three things.</p>
<p>The first thing I learned is intellectual.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s exactly the same thing that David Sachs said, it is completely shocking to me</p>
<p>how much disinformation there is, and also how we are so prone to turning off our brains</p>
<p>and not thinking for ourselves.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really shocking.</p>
<p>And I think 2020 was the year that that was laid bare, that the institutions that feed</p>
<p>you information can&rsquo;t really be trusted, that you can&rsquo;t really trust the interpretation</p>
<p>of actual simple data, that nobody wants to think in first principle.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first one, we have stopped thinking for ourselves.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s an intellectual thing that I&rsquo;ve realized, and I don&rsquo;t want to do it.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ll think for myself, and I&rsquo;ll take the consequences.</p>
<p>The second was economic, which is, wow, we have really over rotated to this crazy form</p>
<p>of globalism that is going to get undone over the next 30 years.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to have a lot of implications.</p>
<p>And it can be done in a way that can rejuvenate the United States, which I think can fix a</p>
<p>lot of the stuff that was created.</p>
<p>And we should talk about that later today.</p>
<p>And then the third is physiological, which is if you didn&rsquo;t know before, I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>tell you now, and it&rsquo;s this three letter word that we make into a four letter word in America,</p>
<p>which is the letters f at, we have a fat epidemic in the United States, almost 80%</p>
<p>of every single person that was hospitalized, because of COVID was clinically obese.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t say it, and you&rsquo;re not allowed to say it, if you say that somebody is fat,</p>
<p>or if you say that somebody is obese, it&rsquo;s all of a sudden, like, you know, you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to get virtue signal canceled.</p>
<p>And instead, what we&rsquo;re doing is we&rsquo;re leaving an entire generation of people</p>
<p>completely abandoning them, because we&rsquo;re not confronting the problem, that by a combination</p>
<p>of food, and the lack of movement, we are setting them up to either die acutely of something</p>
<p>like COVID, or chronically by heart disease and diabetes.</p>
<p>And that it was like, it is now so obvious.</p>
<p>And by the way, that&rsquo;s the other thing where these healthy fit people were running around</p>
<p>double vaxxing and or double masking in Central Park, and they don&rsquo;t even know the basic data.</p>
<p>Like, even if you thought you were going to go to the hospital, the 80% of all of those</p>
<p>millions and millions of hospitalizations were from people that were obese, they had</p>
<p>physiologically, completely taken their body to a place that it wasn&rsquo;t able to fight.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So those are my three takeaways, intellectual, economic and physiological.</p>
<p>Insert one thing on that is because I agree with with everything to Martha said is this</p>
<p>idea of laying bare that laying bare the sort of corruption of these like institutions that</p>
<p>are supposed to be coming up with good policies and educating us and it turns out they, you</p>
<p>know, keep giving us this foolish guidance.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also another institution, I think that was laid bare, which are these education</p>
<p>unions, right?</p>
<p>We had school closures for a year, the learning loss and the isolation that kids are have</p>
<p>experienced.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even know what the results of this are going to be.</p>
<p>This could be a generational consequence.</p>
<p>And what we see from the education unions, they didn&rsquo;t want to go back to school.</p>
<p>They fought it.</p>
<p>You know, we had the whole Oakley school board resign because they just said, well, they</p>
<p>want us to go back to work to be babysitters for their kids so we could smoke pot.</p>
<p>These are people who don&rsquo;t care about the kids.</p>
<p>And after this year, I don&rsquo;t know how anyone can be against school choice or charter schools</p>
<p>or giving parents more involvement in their kids educations.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>Freeberg, coming out of the pandemic, and looking at your own psychology and your own</p>
<p>life, what have you learned?</p>
<p>And what do you take forward in terms of lessons and how you&rsquo;re going to approach post pandemic</p>
<p>life?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll kind of flip it a little bit.</p>
<p>One of the first experiences I had with how broadly people could be influenced in a way</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t have grounding or rooting in facts and reality is when I sold my company</p>
<p>to Monsanto in 2013.</p>
<p>And J. Cal, I think you came with me on one of these trips that I took.</p>
<p>Yeah, I visited Monsanto with you.</p>
<p>And, you know, there was an incredible bias by my team and by me personally, prior to</p>
<p>even engaging in conversations with Monsanto against that company, because they were deemed</p>
<p>to be evil.</p>
<p>And as I spent a lot of time personally kind of digging into the facts and the history</p>
<p>of the business and kind of how we got here, it was surprising to me like how much of the</p>
<p>bias against Monsanto was not rooted in fact, and was in fact, you know, a series of claims</p>
<p>that then became truth and reality, because of the perception, and it just became it,</p>
<p>things got stuck that way.</p>
<p>GMOs are bad, GMOs are evil, that the science of how they work, what they do, why they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>useful, was never contemplated, never became part of the dialogue.</p>
<p>It was just this assumed fact that this is an evil company that this stuff is bad.</p>
<p>And, you know, this is a long, long topic, we can talk about this, I&rsquo;m sure for an entire</p>
<p>hour and a half about the science and technology behind GMOs and how we make food and all that</p>
<p>sort of stuff.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d be happy to do that another time.</p>
<p>But like, for me, I was just so surprised when I engaged with thoughtful friends of</p>
<p>mine who were scientists, even, and they had this bias.</p>
<p>And then when you engage them in a dialogue about like, why, where does that come from?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the rooting?</p>
<p>It just wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>And I got and I mentioned this to you guys, when I was an executive at the management</p>
<p>team in Monsanto, we had a WHO ruling, where a guy got himself elected to the IRC, the</p>
<p>this is the cancer research group within WHO.</p>
<p>He was this liberal guy, who was very anti technology who got himself elected to the</p>
<p>IRC board, and got a ruling made that Roundup is a possible carcinogen.</p>
<p>And that ruling led to a $10 billion lawsuit that Monsanto or now Bayer is settling, which</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t rooted in the science or the facts that the other scientists on the committee had kind of</p>
<p>previously kind of previewed and gone through and said, this isn&rsquo;t cancerous.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s incredible the implications it&rsquo;s had.</p>
<p>And so, I&rsquo;ve always, you know, for several years now, I&rsquo;ve had this kind of belief that</p>
<p>like people can be led to believe things that aren&rsquo;t necessarily rooted in objective truth,</p>
<p>or in fact, or have empirical evidence to behind them.</p>
<p>And this goes back to the origins of religion and monarchies and like, you know, these myths</p>
<p>and these, these, these, these tales we tell ourselves, where we all end up believing something</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some influencing factor that drives that.</p>
<p>I think this has just been an incredible manifestation of that, the misinformation</p>
<p>on both sides, from the beginning to the end of the pandemic.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just been extraordinary to watch.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you change it.</p>
<p>I think social networks amplify it.</p>
<p>You know, I think that the rate at which information or misinformation flows back and forth is</p>
<p>making it easier and quicker to kind of adopt this, you know, systemic, inaccurate belief</p>
<p>system that people might adopt.</p>
<p>And so, you know, it&rsquo;s a big question mark for me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, you know, how we as a people kind of move forward with like objective fact</p>
<p>based decision making and belief systems.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if we ever will.</p>
<p>But well, yeah, it&rsquo;s just how humans are wired, maybe, you know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been giving it a lot of thought.</p>
<p>I really like all of your answers, because mine is very similar.</p>
<p>Number one, I feel like I was always an independent critical thinker in my life, and that I think</p>
<p>I kind of started to pick sides because of Trump that like I just found him so offensive.</p>
<p>And I realized I have to go back to being just an independent critical thinker.</p>
<p>I affiliate with no party.</p>
<p>I assume all news stories are fake news.</p>
<p>I assume all data is being manipulated.</p>
<p>I assume everybody&rsquo;s got an agenda.</p>
<p>I believe everybody&rsquo;s virtue signaling now.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m making the decisions for myself.</p>
<p>And I in the one of the things dovetails exactly what you said, Chamath, which is,</p>
<p>this was a disease of a of, you know, old people, and fat people, obese people,</p>
<p>of which I have been one for far too long.</p>
<p>And this is my commitment is just I got to take my health 100% seriously.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;m 50 years old, I got a trainer, I got a masseuse.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working out and doing weights.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing everything.</p>
<p>I changed my diet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking supplements, the stuff we talked about here.</p>
<p>I went right to my doctor after that episode.</p>
<p>We did, Chamath.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting that body scan for four fucking grand or whatever it costs.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just doing it all.</p>
<p>Are you saying a masseuse is going to help you lose weight?</p>
<p>No, but I&rsquo;ve had a, I&rsquo;ve had shoulders.</p>
<p>Maybe the a**.</p>
<p>Maybe the a**.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Beep that out, beep that out.</p>
<p>No, I just realized I don&rsquo;t stretch.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t stretch.</p>
<p>And my shoulders were getting very tight and being on the computer and everything.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just functionally.</p>
<p>What a man of the people.</p>
<p>What a man of the people.</p>
<p>Oh, look at you.</p>
<p>Which house are you in?</p>
<p>Trader.</p>
<p>I got a masseuse.</p>
<p>Sex every week.</p>
<p>I got to figure out.</p>
<p>No, I got a person.</p>
<p>I got to afford that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m spending my money on making myself healthy.</p>
<p>The third thing, and this is heartfelt and sincere, is that friendship and our loved ones</p>
<p>are really with, along with health is so important.</p>
<p>And I am cherishing every moment, every experience with every friend, knowing that the world can</p>
<p>shut down and whatever, and we have to take advantage of every moment.</p>
<p>And that, for me, is the takeaways.</p>
<p>Just to build on something.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really proud of what you&rsquo;re trying to do, Jason, for your health.</p>
<p>When I, I remember I, you know, you know how we, you all have these high grade school pictures.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like you go to like picture day or whatever.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And there was this crazy contrast that I had in my grade school pictures.</p>
<p>There was like two of them when I was in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>So, I was like, you know, five and six.</p>
<p>And then great, you know, then I was seven or eight.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden, this crazy, hey, what&rsquo;s up, Antonio?</p>
<p>Antonio, I see you.</p>
<p>Miami, Miami, mucho caliente.</p>
<p>Does Antonio realize he&rsquo;s on an international podcast?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re on a podcast that goes out to 500,000 people.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re on YouTube, you&rsquo;re international.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s going international.</p>
<p>Nobody even knows who he is.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like one of the most powerful guys in our industry.</p>
<p>What I was going to say is like, by like, I think when I was like nine or 10, I had</p>
<p>gotten really fat.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Because, because when we moved to Canada, it was a very different food supply.</p>
<p>And then economically, we were in a different place.</p>
<p>We ate what we could afford.</p>
<p>And I put on a lot of weight.</p>
<p>And that weight carried with me until college.</p>
<p>And then after college, and that&rsquo;s when I said, I got to get in shape exactly for the</p>
<p>same reason, Jason, because like, my dad was getting dialyzed, he was constantly, you</p>
<p>know, dealing with these health issues.</p>
<p>And I said, I don&rsquo;t deal with this shit.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a rare thing that happens.</p>
<p>If you think about the number of people that are put in this predicament of like, not even</p>
<p>forget, you&rsquo;re able to get a trainer or whatever.</p>
<p>But there are a ton of people that can only eat what they can afford.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And the reality is, it is just meaningfully cheaper to eat at McDonald&rsquo;s than it is to</p>
<p>go to Whole Foods and be able to buy organic food.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s just not even on the agenda for people.</p>
<p>So this is what I mean by you, we have to be able to say that it&rsquo;s not that people are</p>
<p>fat, because they choose to be that there are these systemic imbalances that make people</p>
<p>sick.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Education and health.</p>
<p>These are the education that we need to work on in America.</p>
<p>Like Sachs, you said it was it last week, Sachs, you said, you know, the I think this</p>
<p>is a great bargain that could happen in America with all this polarization.</p>
<p>If even a republican conservative like Sachs can say, everybody should get a great education,</p>
<p>and everybody should be healthy.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Like, and Sachs isn&rsquo;t a socialist, but this, this is important.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so easy to just get a happy meal, then to eat a salad, you know, or whatever.</p>
<p>I was in Washington, DC this week.</p>
<p>And I met with this organization, which anybody who is interested in this should check out</p>
<p>called Third Way.</p>
<p>And what Third Way is, is a centrist organization, right?</p>
<p>So, they largely work with Dems to try to pull them here.</p>
<p>And I think the republican version is called the Niskansen, I guess, center.</p>
<p>But the idea is I sat with these guys, and I was like, just teach me something.</p>
<p>And they taught me the most incredible thing.</p>
<p>You guys know who Pew is?</p>
<p>Pew goes out and does all these surveys.</p>
<p>The Pew Research Center.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been doing it for decades.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the most respected, I think, in surveys.</p>
<p>Pew does this incredible thing where they go to like a whole bunch of countries in the world.</p>
<p>And they ask this basically very simple question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to ask you guys what you think the answer is.</p>
<p>On a zero to 10 scale, where 10 is important.</p>
<p>What do you think Americans think to the following question?</p>
<p>How important is hard work to get ahead in life?</p>
<p>Meaning, right, so it&rsquo;s a proxy for how Americans think about hard work.</p>
<p>How important is hard work to get ahead in life?</p>
<p>Friedberg, what percentage of Americans do you think that say that hard work</p>
<p>is important to get ahead in life?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll give you a couple of data points in 80%.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But the setup is Indonesia 28% India 38% Germany.</p>
<p>50% Go ahead.</p>
<p>What do you think the answer is?</p>
<p>Well, it should be 100%.</p>
<p>But what do I think it is in the US?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping it&rsquo;s above 60.</p>
<p>I agree with you, sax 100% is the right answer.</p>
<p>And I believe Americans don&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna put Americans at 35%.</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;ve seen so many people get lucky and get rich.</p>
<p>Or just people think the system is rigged, or the victim culture where people tell everybody</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t bother trying because it&rsquo;s rigged.</p>
<p>And you just it&rsquo;s the argument.</p>
<p>Sorry, tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll let you give us the answer in a second.</p>
<p>But I think the argument is that like entrepreneurism</p>
<p>fuels these moments of extraordinary success, but the perception creates the opposite effect,</p>
<p>which is someone can get rich very quickly.</p>
<p>And therefore, there&rsquo;s this luck factor or this unfairness factor</p>
<p>that is inherent in the system, right?</p>
<p>And so, while it does enable hard work to drive tremendous outcomes,</p>
<p>the perception is that holy crap, in three years,</p>
<p>Kylie Jenner went on Instagram and became a billionaire or whatever, right?</p>
<p>And people get really kind of blown away by that.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s discouraging and or one person&rsquo;s success</p>
<p>makes it such that other people can&rsquo;t that it&rsquo;s zero sum when in fact,</p>
<p>a company, what&rsquo;s your what&rsquo;s your number for America?</p>
<p>80%.</p>
<p>The number is 73%.</p>
<p>And we are the third highest ranking country.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Now, if you if you ask then Americans, who better represents the interests of hardworking people,</p>
<p>among Republicans and Democrats, the overwhelming answer is now Republicans,</p>
<p>which is really interesting.</p>
<p>Democrats, even in exit polling basically voted for Biden,</p>
<p>because they just really found Trump distasteful.</p>
<p>And a lot of the people that, you know, basically said,</p>
<p>you know, he&rsquo;s an ass.</p>
<p>And so they voted him out.</p>
<p>But it was not because they believed that Democrats could do the job of actually</p>
<p>reinforcing the values of hard work.</p>
<p>And this goes back to</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want handouts.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t want handouts.</p>
<p>People want a fair shot.</p>
<p>They want an even starting line.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want an even finishing line.</p>
<p>Yeah, they don&rsquo;t they don&rsquo;t no one wants paternalism.</p>
<p>And everyone wants opportunity.</p>
<p>You know, but you take what you&rsquo;re given, when it&rsquo;s available to you.</p>
<p>No one says no, you know, I spent a lot of time with farmers in the Midwest in the United States,</p>
<p>very diehard conservative, generally, right.</p>
<p>And, and farmers benefit greatly from significant government,</p>
<p>federal government support programs,</p>
<p>primarily a crop insurance program and some commodity price support programs.</p>
<p>But, but they are very anti government.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this tremendous irony there, right?</p>
<p>Because they don&rsquo;t want to hand out, they want to kind of be left alone,</p>
<p>they want to be able to run their business they want and I&rsquo;m generalizing, right,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just speaking broadly to kind of the theme of things I hear when I when I meet with farmers.</p>
<p>But when the crop insurance program shows up and direct support payments show up, you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;ll take the check.</p>
<p>You know, and so it&rsquo;s hard to say no.</p>
<p>But I think the motivation for everyone is universally the same, which is right,</p>
<p>I want to have the opportunity to be successful independently.</p>
<p>Are we creating policies that reinforce this?</p>
<p>And are we creating the condition that makes people feel less like a victim,</p>
<p>less looking for handouts?</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s reduce I have a concern about the stimulus checks.</p>
<p>I do think it was a smart thing to do to get us out of this.</p>
<p>But do you guys wonder if this generation which is not going back to work,</p>
<p>we have a shortage of Uber drivers, we have a shortage of bartenders, waiters,</p>
<p>nobody was a lot of people are just choosing not to go to work because they have their stimmies.</p>
<p>America is a place where you come to, because you want to grind, you want to find your own</p>
<p>little engine room. And you want to be in there and you want to put in the hours</p>
<p>and the people that it attracts from around the world.</p>
<p>Speak to that, you know, the way that you can explain,</p>
<p>you know, why Indonesia and India are so far to the left on that same question</p>
<p>is because it&rsquo;s an extremely homogeneous population with zero immigration.</p>
<p>No immigration. Yeah.</p>
<p>I actually think the reason why America so far to the right is it itself selects,</p>
<p>not by, you know, some kind of gender, age or religion or color of skin.</p>
<p>By motivation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s motivation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, if you&rsquo;re motivated to crush you come to the United States.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all we&rsquo;re all what are we like, you know, one generation away,</p>
<p>except Jason, you&rsquo;re two generation American.</p>
<p>My Irish side is sixth generation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all first generation, except for Jason, right? We all moved here</p>
<p>to the United States as immigrants.</p>
<p>As immigrants.</p>
<p>With motivated family. Yeah.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m the least successful of the group.</p>
<p>Is that what you&rsquo;re saying?</p>
<p>Yeah. You&rsquo;re the lazy,</p>
<p>complacent American, whereas we&rsquo;re the hungry immigrants.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying. I&rsquo;m trying. Hey, listen, you&rsquo;re the Daniel Day-Lewis character.</p>
<p>I got too off to do the podcast, so I&rsquo;m doing something right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the Daniel Day-Lewis character in Gangs in New York. You know,</p>
<p>you hate the immigrants, you sit at the boat, you throw eggs at everyone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting you bring that up.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you know where my Irish</p>
<p>forbearers came from and where they immigrated to?</p>
<p>Ireland?</p>
<p>The five points.</p>
<p>Oh, the five points.</p>
<p>We were in the five points.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exactly accurate.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Of course I was. It makes total sense.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not Daniel Day-Lewis. You&rsquo;re the heavier, shorter guy, though.</p>
<p>That was kind of the second.</p>
<p>Not for long. You know what?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I dropped 10 on my quarantine 15 and I gave it to Saks.</p>
<p>Yeah, you did.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking good, Jacob.</p>
<p>You look good in Miami. Miami suits you.</p>
<p>In a weird way, I got to give J-Cal as much credit for where he came from as Chamath,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know, those parts of Brooklyn are maybe as tough as Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Kids with guns. Kids with guns.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, child warriors.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to get chopped.</p>
<p>Always roll with a posse.</p>
<p>By the way, you know, on immigration, I don&rsquo;t know if you guys saw this, you know, George</p>
<p>W. Bush paints now and he paints immigrants.</p>
<p>So I bought his book, I bought a signed copy of it.</p>
<p>I should have brought it to the podcast today, but it&rsquo;s a great book.</p>
<p>I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>Trigger warning.</p>
<p>No, but he actually has some writings in there that talks about the power of immigration and</p>
<p>how immigration is so core to the success of the United States, just to our point.</p>
<p>So this conversation made me think of the book that I just bought this week.</p>
<p>Really cool book, by the way, George W. Bush.</p>
<p>Amazingly great artist really captures the personality of immigrants in his work.</p>
<p>I think the thing is, like, everybody wants to come here to work hard.</p>
<p>Everybody that&rsquo;s here is willing to work hard, right?</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re first generation or not.</p>
<p>And then the question is, can government create policies that allow us to do that and actually</p>
<p>just create a safety net to catch us if we fall?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s what we also all want.</p>
<p>So there are parts of Biden&rsquo;s bill that I think made a ton of sense, like, you know,</p>
<p>making community college free.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really disruptive idea because it&rsquo;ll put a ton of pressure on for profit colleges,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>To like, get their act together or not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good idea.</p>
<p>The child tax credit so that you can actually have subsidized, you know, child care for</p>
<p>your kids.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good idea.</p>
<p>But then where you kind of go astray is then when you start to figure out, you know, the</p>
<p>levels of taxation.</p>
<p>Again, we talked about this last time.</p>
<p>But, you know, I just think that that&rsquo;s where you can kind of demotivate people to not then</p>
<p>put in the hours.</p>
<p>I think this is a good segue also into immigration through our southern border and this incredibly</p>
<p>polarizing issue and how the media is polarizing it, how the parties are polarizing it.</p>
<p>Just to ask a question to see if we even understand the data, how many people do you think are</p>
<p>illegal immigrants in the United States right now?</p>
<p>20 million.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Friedberg, Sachs?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a guess.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess I guess 18 million.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take a slight under to Chamath, but about the right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about the right.</p>
<p>The last number I heard was like 12 million, but that was a few years ago.</p>
<p>Bingo, it&rsquo;s 12.</p>
<p>Now, how many people are apprehended at the southern border a year since 2010 every year?</p>
<p>Half a million.</p>
<p>Anybody else want to take a guess?</p>
<p>50,000.</p>
<p>All right, it&rsquo;s 350,000.</p>
<p>So we literally are tearing the country apart.</p>
<p>And I know that because I watched the movie Sicario, and I&rsquo;m estimating based on the scene</p>
<p>where they ran everyone up at the border and took them away.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my terrifying film.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And awesome.</p>
<p>Like, incredible film.</p>
<p>Just bring his annex because you might have a panic attack.</p>
<p>My favorite modern director, Dennis Villanueva.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>But yes, we digress.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That scene when they&rsquo;re racing the cars into the border crossing border checkpoint.</p>
<p>What it is, it&rsquo;s so intense.</p>
<p>So if you guys are into sci fi, that guy directed The Arrival, which is one of my favorite films.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a fabulous beautiful film.</p>
<p>Yeah, beautiful film.</p>
<p>So literally, the country&rsquo;s being torn apart, a country of 330 million, over 3 million would</p>
<p>be 1%, 0.1% coming into the border.</p>
<p>And we just said, immigration is all these amazing people coming here to who want to</p>
<p>strive and who want great things.</p>
<p>Why are we tearing the country up over this issue?</p>
<p>This is a tough topic.</p>
<p>Well, I think, I think, Jason, I think your point of view on immigration really depends</p>
<p>on where you&rsquo;re sitting in the economy.</p>
<p>So I think for all of us who are in Silicon Valley, we know that something like half of</p>
<p>startups have an immigrant co-founder.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve seen, you know, like PayPal, I think, you know, there were like three or four immigrants</p>
<p>on the founding team.</p>
<p>You know, Peter was born in Germany.</p>
<p>Elon was born in South Africa.</p>
<p>Max was born in Russia.</p>
<p>You know, I was born in South Africa, and then you go down the list.</p>
<p>Same thing with Google, you know, Sergey Brin came from Russia, and just on and on it goes.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re sitting in Silicon Valley as a tech worker, you see that these immigrants</p>
<p>bring tremendous dynamism to the economy.</p>
<p>However, if you&rsquo;re in a low wage job, maybe low skill service, then the, you know, a lot</p>
<p>of this immigration is competition, and it creates wage pressure for you.</p>
<p>So this is why historically, the unions have not been in favor of, you know, of immigration.</p>
<p>You have, you know, a lot of service workers in the minority communities, you know, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of animosity towards immigrants because of that.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, it creates job competition and wage competition.</p>
<p>And I do think, well, so look, it&rsquo;s easy for us to sit here in Silicon Valley, where we</p>
<p>sit in the economy and say, oh, well, let&rsquo;s just have unlimited immigration.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, it doesn&rsquo;t matter to us.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re in the low skill part of the economy, it does matter a lot to let in a</p>
<p>flood of immigrants who are in that low skill category.</p>
<p>And by the way, we&rsquo;re worried about these jobs getting automated away as well.</p>
<p>So, you know, I think you have to have a sensible policy.</p>
<p>I mean, yes to immigration, but I think you have to think about how much sort of low skill</p>
<p>immigration can we assimilate and absorb.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But aren&rsquo;t a lot of those people who are coming in also then taking lower wages because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>off the books and they&rsquo;re illegal.</p>
<p>Whereas if we had a more reasonable policy of letting whatever percentage in, like we</p>
<p>could just pick a number.</p>
<p>And if that actually worked, and they were getting paid on the books, then it would remove</p>
<p>some of that downside pressure.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not paying somebody under the books to be a delivery person or a dishwasher or</p>
<p>whatever the entry level job is, they have to get paid that minimum wage.</p>
<p>Jason, I think this speaks to the broader kind of set of political topics, which relates</p>
<p>to the enablement of competition.</p>
<p>And it speaks to some of the trade policy points that I think the last administration</p>
<p>made, which is to limit trade and to limit access to global markets to provide services</p>
<p>and products to the United States and to tax them.</p>
<p>Because the lower cost labor ultimately outcompetes with higher cost labor in the United States.</p>
<p>And so, you know, you get lower cost goods.</p>
<p>But the balance is, is it worth having lower cost goods and services, where you could actually</p>
<p>see too much of a decline in the employability or in the wages of people that are currently</p>
<p>producing those goods and services in the United States.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the tricky balance, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no blue or red right way to do this.</p>
<p>We want to enable competition, we want to enable progress, we want to enable lower cost</p>
<p>of production, lower cost goods and services.</p>
<p>But we also don&rsquo;t want to have the economic impact and the social impact of people being</p>
<p>underemployed and unemployed.</p>
<p>And balancing those two, one of the tricky pieces of that balancing puzzle is immigration,</p>
<p>another one is trade, another one is regulation, and etc, etc, right?</p>
<p>So, a lot of these things kind of drive that tricky balance.</p>
<p>I really bounce around on this.</p>
<p>I, of all of the four of us, I was the only one that immigrated myself.</p>
<p>So, I didn&rsquo;t, you know, it&rsquo;s not that my parents did it.</p>
<p>Oh, you did it, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.</p>
<p>I did it myself.</p>
<p>I drove to the border, I got a TN visa stamp, you know, I crossed the border into Buffalo,</p>
<p>I stood in line, I got my own social security number.</p>
<p>And I started a life in America in the year 2000.</p>
<p>How old were you?</p>
<p>22, I guess, or 23.</p>
<p>You had a job lined up already?</p>
<p>I had a job, I had a job offer, I had my offer letter, I did the whole thing.</p>
<p>Then I transferred on to an H1B visa, I had to go through all of that, then I had to,</p>
<p>you know, wait in line, I got delayed, I had to refile.</p>
<p>So, as a person that went through the immigration system and finally got their green card in</p>
<p>2007 or 8, and then my, my citizenship in 2011 or 2012, I bounce around on how I feel,</p>
<p>because I remember the insecurity I felt in not wanting to lose my visa and have to</p>
<p>leave and go back to Canada.</p>
<p>And so, if somebody was in that situation, I could see why, you know, they would get</p>
<p>very agitated if they saw a lot of immigration being lumped into one broad brush, right?</p>
<p>And because if you if you look at it, actually, there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a really interesting conundrum,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not like immigration is a thing where all immigrants are pro immigration.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually not that at all.</p>
<p>It tends to be sort of cultural elites are pro immigration, because it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a synthetic</p>
<p>way of showing openness and open mindedness.</p>
<p>But then, you know, inside.</p>
<p>No, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because it doesn&rsquo;t get affected by doesn&rsquo;t get affected by it.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>If anything, it makes it easier for them to maybe find people to hire.</p>
<p>Well, as someone that lived through it, what I would say is it, you know, if I was still</p>
<p>waiting for my green card and waiting in line and having the idea that there was some amnesty</p>
<p>program would have made me feel very insecure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how I would have reacted to it.</p>
<p>But in that moment, I would have felt insecure.</p>
<p>So the broad solution to immigration is you have to separate the two problems and say,</p>
<p>this part of the problem can be solved almost like a professional sports team, which is</p>
<p>to say we have the ability to draft every year, the smartest and most interesting capable</p>
<p>people that want to come here and work hard.</p>
<p>That will probably, you know, it&rsquo;d be a rising tide.</p>
<p>Then there are these two other buckets bucket in the middle is just compassionate openness,</p>
<p>you know, family members and other people refugees, you know, because I was emigrated</p>
<p>into Canada, not in the first bucket, because we didn&rsquo;t have much to contribute economically,</p>
<p>but in the second bucket, which is for social justice and refugees.</p>
<p>And then there is a third bucket, which is there are people that are not going to be</p>
<p>in a position to wait in line, they are going to come to the border.</p>
<p>And we have to have a mechanism of saying, okay, you shouldn&rsquo;t have done it, but you</p>
<p>did.</p>
<p>And now here&rsquo;s a pathway where you can earn the right to prove that you should be here.</p>
<p>And I think that there there&rsquo;s a but we can&rsquo;t have that nuance, because nobody wants to</p>
<p>hear it, you want to lump it into one, you know, this is where, for example, like last</p>
<p>year, when Trump, you know, decapitated the h1 b program, I thought this is just so dumb.</p>
<p>Yeah, no nuance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically telling, you know, like, it&rsquo;s forcing a star athlete, you know, to go and</p>
<p>play a different sport.</p>
<p>Why would you do that?</p>
<p>You know, and it&rsquo;s so artificial, it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s such a reasonable, there&rsquo;s such a reasonable discussion to had to be had here,</p>
<p>because other countries have solved this exact thing with the point based system, Australia,</p>
<p>Canada, New Zealand, and others have all worked on a system like this, which is you get points</p>
<p>for each of the qualities that you bring, and then you put some numbers on it.</p>
<p>But there is no</p>
<p>Jake out those countries are much, much harder to get into the United States.</p>
<p>Well, getting into New Zealand, you better buy a property or something like that.</p>
<p>It might be that the point based system is letting in the people that make the society</p>
<p>stronger.</p>
<p>No, Canada has a really progressive view on this.</p>
<p>I mean, they have a point based system, but they do a lot.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really compassionate about, you know, the folk, they&rsquo;ll take in a lot more refugees</p>
<p>than most other countries.</p>
<p>And I think that that they&rsquo;ve never lost that spirit.</p>
<p>And I think that the point is, I think I agree with Jason, it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s logical.</p>
<p>The problem is, it&rsquo;s too logical.</p>
<p>And, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the free bird made an interesting connection to the issue of free trade.</p>
<p>So, you know, look, you know, I majored in economics in college, you know, I was like</p>
<p>a believer in free trade, like sort of completely ardent free trade, because why it creates</p>
<p>economic efficiency.</p>
<p>And so, you know, it&rsquo;s logical.</p>
<p>And if people lose their jobs, their factory closes, because we&rsquo;re not as good, then yes,</p>
<p>you let the chips fall where they may.</p>
<p>I think what we&rsquo;ve learned over the last 20 or 30 years is that we have to consider the</p>
<p>distributional consequences of a policy like free trade, because it&rsquo;s about, well, who</p>
<p>benefits and who loses?</p>
<p>And yes, American consumers have benefited from the flow of cheap goods from China and</p>
<p>other places.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve seen our manufacturing&hellip;</p>
<p>American producers have lost.</p>
<p>Have lost, yeah.</p>
<p>And so, throughout the Midwest and the Rust Belt, you&rsquo;ve got these empty factories, they</p>
<p>just line up like tombstones up in, you know, places like Detroit.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve got these towns that used to be factory towns are now just kind of empty,</p>
<p>and the people are like hooked on fentanyl, and it&rsquo;s a social disaster.</p>
<p>And so, I think, you know, what I&rsquo;ve kind of learned about this is you have to take</p>
<p>into account the consequences of these policies.</p>
<p>And it can&rsquo;t just be about&hellip;</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;ve evolved your position?</p>
<p>I have.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t just be about a Darwinian economic efficiency anymore.</p>
<p>You have to think about who wins and who loses.</p>
<p>And by the way, what&rsquo;s ironic&hellip;</p>
<p>Can I give you a little history?</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s got feedback on this one.</p>
<p>A lot of the current globalization policy that the United States embraced over the last</p>
<p>two or three decades, I think, Sax, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but a lot of this originated</p>
<p>during the Clinton era, which was, you know, a democratic president.</p>
<p>And then ironically, the free trade Republicans are the ones who have flipped over the last</p>
<p>couple of years to realize the economic consequence on the production side of the United States is so</p>
<p>severe that we need to now limit free trade.</p>
<p>And if you remember, Paul Ryan, you know, who was the House Speaker a few years ago,</p>
<p>had this six-point plan for the Republicans going into the primaries.</p>
<p>And one of the key points was to, you know, enable the Trans-Pacific Partnership.</p>
<p>They were trying to continue to push free trade.</p>
<p>And I think that the policy shift is ironic, because it&rsquo;s always been kind of a red issue,</p>
<p>then it became a blue issue, then it became a red issue.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, like everything, we are evolving our points of view as we</p>
<p>experience and learn more things and get more data.</p>
<p>And perhaps the rate of progress isn&rsquo;t the thing to optimize for, but the rate of progress</p>
<p>balanced against the equality of progress seems to be where the United States is at right now.</p>
<p>To respond to what Freeberg said about how this happens.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an old saying in Washington that the best,</p>
<p>sorry, that the worst ideas are bipartisan.</p>
<p>And the idea of bringing China into the World Trade Organization and giving them</p>
<p>sort of MFN trading status, that happened under Clinton, but it was absolutely a bipartisan</p>
<p>decision.</p>
<p>And part of the reason why our politics are so royal today-</p>
<p>Well, no, it was proposed.</p>
<p>It was proposed, Clinton.</p>
<p>It was passed in Bush.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But they both supported it.</p>
<p>It was a bipartisan sort of disaster.</p>
<p>And I think one of the reasons why our politics are so royal today, you&rsquo;ve got this populism</p>
<p>on the right, and you&rsquo;ve got a populism of the left, and that where they both agree</p>
<p>is in restraining, is having a more protectionist trade policy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So I think a little bit of history here is important.</p>
<p>I think you got most of it right.</p>
<p>But if you go even one step back under Clinton, there was nothing that they actually did.</p>
<p>But it was something that Deng Xiaoping did, which was that, you know, for a large time,</p>
<p>I think until the mid-90s, 94, the renminbi was firmly pegged to the US dollar.</p>
<p>And, you know, it was like, you know, 5.8 renminbi to the US dollar.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, they basically said, well, look, we have this hapless economy.</p>
<p>We have to do something about it.</p>
<p>And we have this enormous bulge of young people.</p>
<p>And so they did this brilliant thing.</p>
<p>And China said, you know, we&rsquo;re going to basically devalue our currency.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re going to basically make it essentially float.</p>
<p>And instantly, you re-rated the currency by 40%.</p>
<p>And over time, it re-rated by almost 60%.</p>
<p>And what it did was all of a sudden, it unleashed, as you said,</p>
<p>all of these subsidies into the United States.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because now Chinese goods became 30% cheaper, right?</p>
<p>And then the Thai goods became 30% cheaper.</p>
<p>Indonesian goods became 80% cheaper, right?</p>
<p>Vietnamese goods became 50% cheaper.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that entire contagion in Eastern Asia that we went through in the late 90s.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like China devalues their currency.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, you have all these young people in China who can make things for 30% cheaper.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re able to flood the American market with goods.</p>
<p>We were like, wow, this is incredible.</p>
<p>My jeans that cost $10 now cost $7.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just using it as a representative example.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to buy more jeans.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re consuming, consuming, consuming.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, Bush comes along and says, well, this seems to be working out well.</p>
<p>I want to go to war with Iraq.</p>
<p>I need to basically get China to vote yes in the Security Council.</p>
<p>OK, what&rsquo;s it going to take?</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s like, admit me to the WTO.</p>
<p>Because even during all of this, they were still not part of the WTO, to David&rsquo;s point.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when the nuclear bomb went off in 2004.</p>
<p>The minute that they were involved and they could actually have bilateral trade</p>
<p>relationships and normalize trade relationships, then all of a sudden, the next wave happens</p>
<p>because instead of just buying cheap Chinese jeans, every American company was like, wait a</p>
<p>minute, I can drive up earnings by just exporting this factory to China writ large.</p>
<p>And the Chinese had all this capital that they had built up all these US dollars to</p>
<p>then support it and subsidize it.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma, right?</p>
<p>Shamoff, because if you don&rsquo;t do it as an American company, and you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>move your manufacturing there, and everybody else does your shareholders, your shareholders</p>
<p>will decapitate your stock prices, you know, as a CEO, you get fired.</p>
<p>And so, so then that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s when David that what you said happened.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you hollow out from 2014 to 2016.</p>
<p>You hollow out the middle class, you hollowed out the inside the Rust Belt.</p>
<p>And then basically, you de industrialized the West, you saw the rise of populism,</p>
<p>you saw the rise of opioids as essentially a coping mechanism</p>
<p>for people&rsquo;s inability to even work hard, right?</p>
<p>To talk back to the first thing to have purpose, Shamoff,</p>
<p>Americans are wired to work hard, right?</p>
<p>So they need to self medicate.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t let them work hard.</p>
<p>Yeah, they turn to fentanyl and opioids to do it.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden, Donald Trump gets elected in 2016.</p>
<p>So what have we learned without hope is the man without fear, you know, you give people</p>
<p>no job and no purpose in the morning, what happens and the Democratic Party&rsquo;s turn to</p>
<p>socialism, I think that&rsquo;s like part of it as well.</p>
<p>So this is really interesting, because we&rsquo;re talking about second, the set that I think</p>
<p>everybody who was doing this was considering the second order problems.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;re experiencing now is the third order problem,</p>
<p>which is things that people couldn&rsquo;t predict.</p>
<p>Like, we now have a communist country that is not changing its human rights record and</p>
<p>is not changing its behavior, and might even be getting worse.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve enabled China, but but Jason, China,</p>
<p>China will actually self regulate, I actually think now,</p>
<p>the China issue is a little overblown the way we take it.</p>
<p>Meaning, I think China&rsquo;s central planners are frankly, just much, much smarter than</p>
<p>ours.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>They just are.</p>
<p>Well, they have several planning.</p>
<p>And better tools.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have a limbic system that&rsquo;s just reactionary to the current</p>
<p>or any legal system.</p>
<p>They have no legal system.</p>
<p>That should scare us that they&rsquo;re more effective planners than our our politicians.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing that smart policy can&rsquo;t outrun, though.</p>
<p>It cannot outrun demographics.</p>
<p>And the most important takeaway that I learned over the last few weeks when I was studying</p>
<p>this problem, because I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot just currently, like, okay, inflation,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the 10 year view?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s just going to happen?</p>
<p>Like, what&rsquo;s my macro view of the world?</p>
<p>And I saw the most interesting stat, which is the median age in China.</p>
<p>And the median age in South Asia is greater now than the median age in America.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s in the mid 40s versus the mid 30s.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an enormously important thing.</p>
<p>Because now you have an aging population in China.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve had this one child policy that&rsquo;s really has worked against them for a very long time.</p>
<p>So they have they have an underrepresentation of these young people.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re flexing now to managing a demographic shift where folks are older.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not going to work in a factory.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not making goods the same way they used to.</p>
<p>Economic growth is tapering.</p>
<p>And so that whole China situation, in fact, demographically is going to solve itself.</p>
<p>But the implications for America are not good.</p>
<p>Meaning, I think inflation goes up, commodity prices go up, prices of everything go up.</p>
<p>But it allows us to actually reestablish and rejuvenate the industrialized Rust Belt of</p>
<p>America.</p>
<p>We just have to spend the money.</p>
<p>And this is where I think, like, when you look at Biden&rsquo;s plan, this is where I wonder,</p>
<p>like, didn&rsquo;t anybody do this simple macroeconomic, you know, trace route to actually come up</p>
<p>with this?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s pretty obvious what to do.</p>
<p>And then you wonder, which is why I mean, have have literally a trillion dollars allocated</p>
<p>to reestablishing entire supply chains across critical industries that we want to own,</p>
<p>which I think Friedberg, you brought up what 15 episodes ago that this is an incredible</p>
<p>opportunity for us to bring manufacturing here and bring the next generation and reinvent</p>
<p>manufacturing.</p>
<p>I still think biomanufacturing represents this complete, great domain where the United</p>
<p>States could build and lead.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ll just give you some statistics.</p>
<p>Globally, there&rsquo;s about 25 million liters of fermentation capacity or biomanufacturing</p>
<p>capacity.</p>
<p>Of that about 20 million is used to make beer and wine and pharmaceutical drugs today in</p>
<p>an enclosed system.</p>
<p>5 million is available for rent.</p>
<p>And of that 4 million is already rented out.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s only a million liters of capacity really available for rent.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 100 synthetic biology companies that are looking to produce fermentation based</p>
<p>products from materials for clothing, to food to animal protein to new drugs, and they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get the capacity to make this stuff and every one of them is scrambling around Silicon Valley</p>
<p>looking to raise hundreds of millions of dollars of venture funding to go build friggin manufacturing</p>
<p>capacity for biomanufacturing.</p>
<p>This is where the United States can lead.</p>
<p>Because we can make every material, every drug and every consumable that the entire</p>
<p>world would use using biomanufacturing.</p>
<p>And just to be clear, biomanufacturing-</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s roll, let&rsquo;s effing go.</p>
<p>So you edit the DNA of an organism and it can be programmed to make a molecule for you.</p>
<p>And so we can use large fermenter tanks to make this stuff.</p>
<p>I did the math recently, and you would need about 10 to 50 billion liters of capacity</p>
<p>to make all the animal protein for the entire world.</p>
<p>And using 45,000 liter tanks, which are three meters wide each, it would take about 30 to</p>
<p>40 square miles of fermentation tanks to make all the protein for the whole world.</p>
<p>We could build that in the United States for about-</p>
<p>In Nebraska.</p>
<p>For about $300 to $400 billion.</p>
<p>And we could build it in a couple of years.</p>
<p>I mean, that is like a moonshot.</p>
<p>You could also make materials for clothing.</p>
<p>You could make-</p>
<p>Detroit.</p>
<p>You could make bioplastics-</p>
<p>Go to the Rust Belt.</p>
<p>Put it there.</p>
<p>And this is like this, because today the science exists.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like go back to like the internet era.</p>
<p>We now have this ability to program organisms to make stuff for us.</p>
<p>This did not exist 10 years ago, 15 years ago, 20 years ago.</p>
<p>Today is the moment it exists.</p>
<p>So, if we don&rsquo;t capitalize on this huge budget to build infrastructure to go after this massive</p>
<p>opportunity to make everything that the world consumes, we&rsquo;re going to miss out and free</p>
<p>markets will compete us away.</p>
<p>This is the one time that big check can be written and that big check can enable this</p>
<p>new industry.</p>
<p>And instead of making cars and making, you know, all the stuff that maybe we don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>to be making anymore-</p>
<p>You really think that all this trillions of infrastructure spending is going to what you</p>
<p>just described?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my point.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my point.</p>
<p>And I think that, but that&rsquo;s what I mean is we&rsquo;re missing this opportunity.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re rebranding the same old social programs as infrastructure because the politicians</p>
<p>know that&rsquo;s one of the last categories of spending that&rsquo;s still popular.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not going to go to the right things.</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>Those labels, those labels pull well.</p>
<p>When you say jobs, like for example, one of the things I learned, which is insane, is</p>
<p>that for whatever reason, people think fixing climate change is a net negative because it</p>
<p>will restrict one&rsquo;s way of life and destroy jobs.</p>
<p>Whereas in fact, it&rsquo;s the exact opposite.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It should actually allow you to do more, live healthier, and there should be an entire</p>
<p>renaissance of industries and jobs.</p>
<p>And so it goes back to the disinformation just makes a rational conversation almost</p>
<p>impossible.</p>
<p>Speaking of politics, can we just shift to Caitlyn Jenner real quick before we wrap because</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re almost out of time.</p>
<p>Caitlyn Jenner is officially running for governor.</p>
<p>And I guess people are making light of it.</p>
<p>But Sachs, you actually wrote a considered post on it.</p>
<p>So unpack it for us.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was defending Caitlyn Jenner.</p>
<p>I mean, look, I mean, what Caitlyn Jenner came out and said is that Gavin Newsom&rsquo;s DAs,</p>
<p>Chesa Boudin and George Gaskin in LA are presiding, I&rsquo;m putting words in her mouth,</p>
<p>presiding over a crime wave.</p>
<p>And she was calling him out on that.</p>
<p>And what you then immediately saw was all of Gavin&rsquo;s people come out and criticize her</p>
<p>for being stupid because supposedly, she didn&rsquo;t know that DAs were locally elected.</p>
<p>Well, I think a couple of points there.</p>
<p>First of all, why hasn&rsquo;t Gavin Newsom come out and distance himself from Chesa Boudin</p>
<p>and George Gaskin and what they&rsquo;re doing in those cities?</p>
<p>He hasn&rsquo;t done that because he&rsquo;s been cozying up to their side, the sort of progressive</p>
<p>extreme radical decarcerationist wing of the party.</p>
<p>And the reason we know that is because he recently had a job to fill, the attorney general</p>
<p>spot in California.</p>
<p>He could have chosen anybody for that job.</p>
<p>And he chose an East Bay Assemblyman named Rob Bonta for it, who is an ally of Chesa</p>
<p>Boudin and Gaskin and this progressive DA alliance.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, it&rsquo;s true that Newsom didn&rsquo;t appoint these DAs, but he&rsquo;s appointing their</p>
<p>allies to posts that are even more important, the attorney general of all of California.</p>
<p>And so, I think it was a very legitimate issue for Caitlyn Jenner to come out and call out</p>
<p>Gavin Newsom on.</p>
<p>And I think she&rsquo;s onto something here, which is there&rsquo;s a lot of issues in California.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things that are wrong from homelessness to unemployment and these crazy</p>
<p>COVID restrictions.</p>
<p>But the number one issue, I think, has to be crime.</p>
<p>We are seeing an explosion of crime in our streets.</p>
<p>We all know there are large parts of LA and San Francisco that we do not feel comfortable</p>
<p>walking around in anymore.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be crazy to walk down the street with a child.</p>
<p>The livable area where you feel safe living or opening a business or walking around has</p>
<p>drastically shrunk in the last few years.</p>
<p>And if you do not feel safe in your city, nothing else politically matters.</p>
<p>The government&rsquo;s first responsibility is to protect its people.</p>
<p>And I think if Caitlyn Jenner can keep speaking out on issues like this, I think maybe she</p>
<p>has a shot.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that she&rsquo;s got a credible shot if she has a reasonable economic policy behind</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And, you know, this, the school voucher thing on education.</p>
<p>Those are the things that will carry California voters because I do think and by the way,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s where I think we should take some credit.</p>
<p>The best thing about this podcast, other than the fact that we used ourselves to keep us</p>
<p>sane, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s made it it&rsquo;s made it fashionable, fashionable to think independently again.</p>
<p>And eventually what becomes fashionable becomes the rigor.</p>
<p>And what that means is I think that there will be more and more people that will think</p>
<p>for themselves.</p>
<p>And if she has reasonable policies and a platform that&rsquo;s understandable, she can win.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an incredible testament, I think, to people making their own decisions.</p>
<p>And being able to have a reasonable conversation with people with different opinions, I think</p>
<p>is the other takeaway from the podcast that people always give me that feedback when they</p>
<p>see me on the street or whatever, and talk to me about it.</p>
<p>And as a point, going to Austin, they are now dealing with tent city problems like LA</p>
<p>and the same problems that they&rsquo;re dealing with, we&rsquo;re dealing with in San Francisco.</p>
<p>So I went for a walk around the lake a couple of times, it was great.</p>
<p>And, you know, there were a lot of tents.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re literally taking the most beautiful lake in the entire beautiful part of the city.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s becoming camp central, they&rsquo;re basically ruining it for the, the actual</p>
<p>citizens who are not homeless.</p>
<p>Austin lifted the tent ban they had in Texas.</p>
<p>Now Texas is voting now the entire conversation when I was in Austin, all conversations did</p>
<p>not go to NFTs, crypto, the border or anything, it went to tent city.</p>
<p>And people in Austin who are very liberal, we&rsquo;re saying, I&rsquo;m voting to ban tent city.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m voting, I&rsquo;m voting against, you know, this insanity, because it&rsquo;s we don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to become San Francisco, we don&rsquo;t want to become LA.</p>
<p>So the and these are liberal people.</p>
<p>And the the concept that a city would allow people to camp in the center of the city and</p>
<p>ruin it for everybody else is insane.</p>
<p>Portland&rsquo;s version of Amsterdam is still up and running.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a year.</p>
<p>I mean, if people want to camp, we have campgrounds for that send the campers to the campgrounds.</p>
<p>Can I tell you the secret origin story of Miami and why Miami is now a tech hub?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because of this issue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because a tech entrepreneur got punched in the face by a homeless person in San Francisco.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;d want me to tell the story.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll find out afterwards.</p>
<p>And you can beep out his name, but basically, who is a prolific tech founder, he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;d want me to tell the story, but he was out just would you do beeps?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll do two beeps.</p>
<p>Anyway, he was out walking around San Francisco.</p>
<p>And a crazy homeless person just walked up and punched him in the face for no reason.</p>
<p>And this is something this homeless person has done many times.</p>
<p>The cops were there just kind of shrugged.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t want to prosecute it.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t want to write up a ticket.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, No, I really want to press charges.</p>
<p>So the cops like, Okay, fine.</p>
<p>So then, you know, he presses charges.</p>
<p>Nothing happens.</p>
<p>The DA office basically keeps, you know, giving him the run around until he basically says,</p>
<p>Fine, forget it.</p>
<p>He drops charges.</p>
<p>He just moves.</p>
<p>He just votes with his feet.</p>
<p>So he moves to Miami.</p>
<p>He was the first one from that sort of like the sort of the core, like Silicon Valley</p>
<p>plugged in ecosystem to move out to Miami.</p>
<p>He says he did the seed round.</p>
<p>Then he talked to Keith Raboy.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s the one who convinced Keith Raboy to move to Miami.</p>
<p>So Keith Raboy then did the Series A.</p>
<p>He did the Series A. So Keith was the seed investor of Miami, and he got Raboy to do</p>
<p>the Series A. And then Raboy, you know, he&rsquo;s very, you know, prominent and loud on social</p>
<p>media.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been evangelizing the whole thing.</p>
<p>And then he got Delian and Founders Fund and their whole noise machine to move, you know,</p>
<p>their circus to Miami.</p>
<p>And now look at it.</p>
<p>Look at it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here.</p>
<p>Now, it took it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got a mayor of Miami, Francis Suarez, who actually said, We want tech here, right?</p>
<p>You know, and they don&rsquo;t have a homeless problem.</p>
<p>The city has a lot of cops.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s well managed.</p>
<p>So look, he&rsquo;s got the right environment.</p>
<p>And most of all, the city of Miami is welcoming to the tech ecosystem, where San Francisco,</p>
<p>the politicians seem to can&rsquo;t wait to get rid of it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s all comes back to this homeless issue.</p>
<p>I think if hadn&rsquo;t gotten punched in the face by the homeless person, I think this all would</p>
<p>have played out very differently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very true.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s wrap on a quick fang.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t you must have seen every single major tech company had a massive blowout quarter.</p>
<p>And when I say massive, I mean, unbelievable.</p>
<p>And the five, the five tech companies now collectively this year will make more than</p>
<p>$1.2 trillion trillion with a T of revenue.</p>
<p>If those five companies were a country, it would be the 14th largest country in the world.</p>
<p>Wow, we&rsquo;re not talking market cap here, folks, we&rsquo;re talking cash in the bank account,</p>
<p>just revenue, no, no, just revenue, revenue, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not talking profits, which is which, which I think is a good proxy for GDP.</p>
<p>And so the point is, you know, if these companies were countries, collectively fang would be</p>
<p>a top 15 country.</p>
<p>And, and if you and so I guess really, what we&rsquo;ve learned is what we&rsquo;ve known, which is,</p>
<p>okay, these are monopolies.</p>
<p>They have pricing power.</p>
<p>You know, unfortunately, Facebook had to actually even disclose that, you know, inventory only</p>
<p>grew by 12%.</p>
<p>But prices grew by 35%.</p>
<p>You know, Google basically showed the same thing.</p>
<p>And if you go back to sort of like the pillar of antitrust law, which is that 1970 odd Supreme</p>
<p>Court case, it defined what&rsquo;s called the consumer welfare test, right?</p>
<p>So, so, you know, the FTC and DOJ, they&rsquo;re relatively toothless in the face of companies</p>
<p>cutting prices, but they can really act when companies raise prices.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s where their definition of a monopoly, which is brittle, it doesn&rsquo;t account for 20.</p>
<p>You know, 2021 tech companies does come into play, because now you can see that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re winding up their pricing power if they can raise prices.</p>
<p>Number one, the second thing that I&rsquo;ll say is the Apple Facebook thing is a very important</p>
<p>canary in the coal mine as well.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not as if the five of them can actually work together.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s infighting, right?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>Well, with this new update to iOS, you know, what those dialogues will essentially do,</p>
<p>in my opinion, if I had to guess is limit inventory, right?</p>
<p>So Facebook and Google will have fewer ads that they can actually run in a targeted way.</p>
<p>And so the only way that they can keep then growing revenue with fewer impressions is</p>
<p>by raising prices even more.</p>
<p>And then the last thing I&rsquo;ll say is, you know, this complicated dynamic between Apple, Facebook</p>
<p>and Google is that Google still pays Apple almost 70 or $80 billion for search, whereas</p>
<p>Facebook pays them nothing.</p>
<p>So if you put all these things in a box, I think you&rsquo;re going to see the beginning of</p>
<p>the end.</p>
<p>This is where now you can see the end game come into focus, which is wedding.</p>
<p>Well, you don&rsquo;t need necessarily new laws and section 230.</p>
<p>Although we&rsquo;ll have that you now see Fang M moving into the line of sight of the traditional</p>
<p>antitrust framework, because now they can use very traditional, you know, anti competitive</p>
<p>pricing law to go after these guys.</p>
<p>I am going to I am going to strongly disagree with Chamath.</p>
<p>Okay, and I&rsquo;ve not disagreed with Chamath this strongly since we&rsquo;ve done the podcast.</p>
<p>But the reason I strongly disagree is because this is not inventory that is being sold at</p>
<p>a fixed price where the price is set by the company.</p>
<p>Facebook and Google, in particular, run an auction model, they are a marketplace business,</p>
<p>they have advertisers who show up, and they bid on ads, which is the inventory that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>able to get based on the data that they&rsquo;re able to match to that particular ad slot.</p>
<p>If the advertisers can get more value by bidding a higher price, because of the data that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting that shows that this customer is more likely to click on the ad and ultimately buy</p>
<p>something, they will bid more for the ads.</p>
<p>What has been such an incredible juggernaut of a business for both Google and then Facebook,</p>
<p>which was effectively a mimic of Google system was this auction model.</p>
<p>And the innovation has been in getting more data, as you as you track consumers around</p>
<p>the internet.</p>
<p>And secondly, is in the smart ad targeting, which is where the algorithm figures out which</p>
<p>ad to show the consumer based on whether that consumer is likely to click on the ad or not.</p>
<p>And the more consumers click on the ads, the more advertisers are willing to pay for an</p>
<p>impression, because that ad is now going to come that ad is now going to convert to more</p>
<p>revenue for them.</p>
<p>That is why this is not a monopolistic approach to pricing.</p>
<p>It is an auction approach.</p>
<p>And I think and it&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;ve won in the past over this argument.</p>
<p>But yeah, go ahead, I could go ahead at Facebook, my team was the one that built it.</p>
<p>So I oversaw those guys back in 2008 and nine, when we did the first version of it,</p>
<p>obviously, it&rsquo;s gotten much more sophisticated.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right, it&rsquo;s a victory auction.</p>
<p>And literally, my mandate to the team was, I don&rsquo;t want your innovations, copy Google,</p>
<p>and give me a version of what Google looks like.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to implement it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not exclusively that ads are not sold entirely based on that system.</p>
<p>Ads are sold direct via a team.</p>
<p>So for example, when Budweiser writes $100 million check or Procter and Gamble, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not necessarily stepping in the auction the same way as a small and medium sized business.</p>
<p>And if you look at how Facebook and Google have oriented their policy, they&rsquo;ve only highlighted</p>
<p>those people because David, to those people, you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very legitimate market clearing price argument for them.</p>
<p>But there are an entire class of advertisers that come in over the top saying brand advertisers,</p>
<p>yeah, that gets structured deals that get structured API&rsquo;s, they get structured access</p>
<p>and Facebook is and Google is setting price.</p>
<p>And Microsoft is setting price.</p>
<p>And so this is where that&rsquo;s the entry point, because at the end of the day, an impression</p>
<p>to David Friedberg, whether it&rsquo;s seen by the local taco shop, or Procter and Gamble,</p>
<p>some of it will be a victory auction, some of it will be structured inventory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a convoluted mess of the two.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t tease it out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right at the end.</p>
<p>At the end, it&rsquo;s about getting CPM higher, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about cost per 1000 impressions.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a long I think this is a good conversation.</p>
<p>Episode 31.</p>
<p>I would love to talk about some of my early days at Google and how we made some of those</p>
<p>decisions.</p>
<p>Because I think it&rsquo;s instrumental to how this is designed to be ultimately a system of commerce</p>
<p>efficiency.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>Not just a system of selling ads.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s talk let&rsquo;s talk about it later.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, as we wrap most impressive observation from these quarterly reports that just came</p>
<p>out for me, Amazon&rsquo;s ad business, 24 billion, growing at 77% year over year, on top of their</p>
<p>Amazon Web Services business.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be bigger than AWS in three years at this rate.</p>
<p>Yeah, what&rsquo;s everyone else&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s everyone else&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>That to me was like, whoa.</p>
<p>What was the most impressive thing for the rest of you guys on all the earnings?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of impressive things here.</p>
<p>I have a second, but go ahead.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was unbelievably impressive.</p>
<p>But we have, we have four enormous monopolies on our hands.</p>
<p>And if I was a betting man, end of decade, these four monopolies will not exist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make that bet.</p>
<p>Oh, broken up.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>By the end by the end of this decade.</p>
<p>So 2030.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Long bet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to bet you dollars to donuts.</p>
<p>That what they face breakup.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet a couple donuts.</p>
<p>You bet a couple dollars.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll give the donuts to sacks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m left donuts.</p>
<p>Sacks.</p>
<p>What was your sacks?</p>
<p>What was your takeaway?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I would up level it slightly in antitrust.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s historically two schools.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the Bork school and the Brandeis school.</p>
<p>Bork was narrowly focused just on consumer harm and would be closer to like the Freeberg position.</p>
<p>The Brandeis school is more about concentrations of power.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And would be more concerned about, you know,</p>
<p>not letting people get too powerful in this American democracy.</p>
<p>And I think the interesting thing is now that there&rsquo;s folks on the right</p>
<p>who definitely are buying into the Brandeis school because of the restrictions on free speech</p>
<p>and access to the marketplace of ideas that companies like Amazon, actually all of them,</p>
<p>Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook have all imposed.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re limiting people&rsquo;s access to the marketplace of ideas.</p>
<p>So I think now it&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re seeing a combination of both the right and the left get together saying these companies</p>
<p>are too big.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re too powerful.</p>
<p>I think the Republicans are saying, well, let you keep the money.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to take your wealth.</p>
<p>The Democrats are saying, we&rsquo;re going to take your power and your wealth.</p>
<p>The Republicans are saying, we want to level your power a little bit.</p>
<p>But I think, you know, these forces are going to come together.</p>
<p>And I agree with Chamath.</p>
<p>I think, I don&rsquo;t know exactly when, but I think these companies are going to get broken up and</p>
<p>knocked down because they are too powerful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good counter argument, Sax.</p>
<p>I mean, the other, that more important point of view of power</p>
<p>versus, you know, economic harm to consumers is an important one.</p>
<p>Clearly, there&rsquo;s no accounting for that quantitatively and politics will drive it.</p>
<p>I think like, it&rsquo;s just incredible.</p>
<p>I mean, if you guys think about it as a consumer, I mean, how incredible are the</p>
<p>products that Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple have made?</p>
<p>And free, and all free.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll still exist if they get broken.</p>
<p>I mean, even the iPhone, like ordering stuff on Amazon.</p>
<p>Every day I&rsquo;m amazed and marvel at the world we live in, at the shit that we can do with</p>
<p>the click of a button.</p>
<p>I mean, it is such an incredible world we live in because of these businesses.</p>
<p>So, as much as we can hound them for all the wealth and monopoly power.</p>
<p>But David, here&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the problem is that Apple and Google in particular have a monopoly on the applications</p>
<p>that can exist on these incredible phones.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And if you can&rsquo;t get access to the App Store, you can&rsquo;t exist as an app, and frankly, you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t even have a business in the modern world if these guys cut you off.</p>
<p>And so, we already saw a congressional hearing very recently in which Spotify and some other</p>
<p>apps were testifying against Google and Apple because&hellip;</p>
<p>And the Apple tax.</p>
<p>Because, yes, because these platforms were discriminating against those applications</p>
<p>in order to benefit themselves.</p>
<p>And I think that in particular has to be looked at, and I think eventually stopped.</p>
<p>Two things.</p>
<p>Two things.</p>
<p>Apple just got sued by the EU today.</p>
<p>So, they got slapped with antitrust for their App Store.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s going to sort itself out as well.</p>
<p>So, you have all this, as Jason said, Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>I wanted to read to you guys something.</p>
<p>Justin just put it in the chat.</p>
<p>This is something I said to Brad Gerstner in 2019 when he was interviewing me for something.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s even more true today than it was in 2019.</p>
<p>I said the following.</p>
<p>I said, my perspective on Facebook is the reason why the market gives it a small multiple.</p>
<p>Because by the way, you hear this all the time.</p>
<p>Like, my gosh, these companies are so cheap.</p>
<p>Why are they so cheap?</p>
<p>I said, the reason why the market gives it such a small multiple is because they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>believe, the market, the market doesn&rsquo;t believe that their earnings potential is durable.</p>
<p>Because the market is sure that in the next 10 or so years, governments will start to act</p>
<p>because they care about their own self-preservation.</p>
<p>So, if you get very reductionist, at the end of the day, that&rsquo;s what governments care about.</p>
<p>And so, they&rsquo;re going to legislate to protect their monopoly, which is the ability to have</p>
<p>power.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>There it is, folks.</p>
<p>A shout-out from Chamath to Chamath in 2019.</p>
<p>Shout-out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to give a shout-out to myself.</p>
<p>Jason, I would like to do this.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t hurt your arm patting yourself on the back.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t hurt you.</p>
<p>You got to stretch that out with your functional stretching on Sundays.</p>
<p>I get my functional stretch on.</p>
<p>Love you, besties.</p>
<p>Bestie, when are you guys coming back, please?</p>
<p>Can we play poker now that we&rsquo;re all vaccinated?</p>
<p>I might have to go to New York next week to just round out my three-city tour.</p>
<p>Can we book the Miami trip, Chamath?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go out there.</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re doing a live show.</p>
<p>Oh, big news is coming, everybody.</p>
<p>We are going to be putting up a voting mechanism.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be able to vote with your dollar with a tiny donation to see all in live,</p>
<p>whichever city gets the most donations.</p>
<p>No, no, let&rsquo;s just go to Miami.</p>
<p>All right, fine, we&rsquo;re going to Miami.</p>
<p>But where are we going to donate the money to?</p>
<p>Have we decided that, or?</p>
<p>I mean, I think it should be something in relation.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s play poker and the winner or, you know, do a single hand payload.</p>
<p>And the winner gets to decide the charity of their choice.</p>
<p>Oh, I like that.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>That could be fun.</p>
<p>I mean, I think something that we&rsquo;ve all agreed on.</p>
<p>Can we just decide to sell tickets in Miami, New York and be done with the show?</p>
<p>Miami, Miami.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I think Miami and New York.</p>
<p>We could just do a one-two.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a quick jump.</p>
<p>Chamath, you decide the date.</p>
<p>The rest of us will make it work.</p>
<p>These guys are already there.</p>
<p>End of May, we&rsquo;re going to pick a date.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to go to Miami.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to do the first taped live all in.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to sell.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to sell tickets for like five or ten bucks.</p>
<p>Yum, yum.</p>
<p>All the proceeds go to charity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got to be more like 50 or 25 because of the venue.</p>
<p>Because we have to, the venue&rsquo;s got to get their vig.</p>
<p>But anyway, love you, besties.</p>
<p>Love you guys.</p>
<p>Love you, Freeberg.</p>
<p>Love you, Chamath.</p>
<p>Back at you.</p>
<p>Most of all, everybody.</p>
<p>Love you, Jacob.</p>
<p>Love you, Sax.</p>
<p>Love you, Sax.</p>
<p>Back at you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see you all next time on the All In podcast.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Rain man David Sacks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>And it said we open sourced it to the fans, and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you, Weston.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the queen of Kinhoan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>What your winners lie.</p>
<p>What your winners lie.</p>
<p>What your winners lie.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>Go 13.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my dog taking a shit on your driveway seat.</p>
<p>Sax.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>My avid Asher will meet me at the place for the shoot.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they&rsquo;re all just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension, but they just need to release it out.</p>
<p>What about B?</p>
<p>What about B?</p>
<p>B?</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
