<p>gonna entertain everyone let&rsquo;s kick it</p>
<p>off with social media we want to show</p>
<p>equal love to them we&rsquo;re going to give</p>
<p>them top building starting off with this</p>
<p>show Andrew from YouTube is it possible</p>
<p>to do healthy raw vegan keto</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s more difficult because when you</p>
<p>do vegan you have um a lot of carbs and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to get enough fat</p>
<p>and the type of complete protein that</p>
<p>you need but it&rsquo;s possible just takes a</p>
<p>little bit more work and you got to make</p>
<p>sure that you um get enough zinc because</p>
<p>normally zinc comes from like animal</p>
<p>products but you can still get it from</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>other sources as well and then you have</p>
<p>the active form of vitamin A which is</p>
<p>difficult like retinol that&rsquo;s hard to</p>
<p>get DHA is hard to get so you can do it</p>
<p>but it takes a little bit more work</p>
<p>all right well good luck on that when</p>
<p>Jeanette also from YouTube I&rsquo;m allergic</p>
<p>to lemons no lemonade for her what can I</p>
<p>drink as an alternative to lemon water</p>
<p>well you can do the apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>water that would give you a different</p>
<p>um angle and that really helps your</p>
<p>blood sugars and it&rsquo;s good for</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>insulin resistance it&rsquo;s good for your</p>
<p>liver so I would do the outside of</p>
<p>vinegar do like a tablespoon and a glass</p>
<p>of water drink that thing down and uh</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re good to go</p>
<p>okay one more from uh from uh social</p>
<p>media Southern Bella as she calls</p>
<p>herself I&rsquo;ve had acne the past three</p>
<p>years after taking an antibiotic that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting what are your five biggest</p>
<p>steps she wants five biggest tips to get</p>
<p>rid of it</p>
<p>all right number one you need a</p>
<p>probiotic</p>
<p>number two you need a Prebiotic so just</p>
<p>combine those in sauerkraut just start</p>
<p>consuming sauerkraut on a regular basis</p>
<p>because if you you know there&rsquo;s when you</p>
<p>start uh destroying your microbiome in</p>
<p>your gut oh my gosh not only can it mess</p>
<p>up your skin because there&rsquo;s microbes on</p>
<p>your skin as well that get uh altered</p>
<p>but also</p>
<p>um it affects people&rsquo;s mood I mean they</p>
<p>can actually get depressed from doing</p>
<p>that antibiotics also have a side effect</p>
<p>of increasing um</p>
<p>um like blood sugars and uh</p>
<p>um also throw off your mineral balance</p>
<p>because you know you&rsquo;re not making</p>
<p>enough lactic acid from the</p>
<p>lactobacillus so it just it just creates</p>
<p>a huge huge problem so we got Prebiotic</p>
<p>we have a probiotic in the Prebiotic</p>
<p>okay and then</p>
<p>um as far as acne goes that&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>androgen problem so you wouldn&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>um if you&rsquo;re female you want to make</p>
<p>sure you don&rsquo;t have PCOS and the way to</p>
<p>do that is just to start avoiding these</p>
<p>things called carbohydrates so number</p>
<p>three reduce carbs number four start</p>
<p>doing fasting there&rsquo;s nothing better</p>
<p>than your skin than a nice glowing skin</p>
<p>than doing regular fasting I mean take a</p>
<p>look at steep I mean it&rsquo;s amazing his</p>
<p>skin and the last thing</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>for acne is to take enough vitamin d</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s the Sun that would be the</p>
<p>ideal situation or just take it as a</p>
<p>supplement</p>
<p>so there we have our five my goodness we</p>
<p>could actually go to six zinc is also</p>
<p>really important too</p>
<p>wow bonus bonus advice well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>terrific well good luck to you that&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>an agonizing problem to have that most</p>
<p>of us suffer with from sometimes so I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t wait for you to report back in</p>
<p>with a nice clear face and why don&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>kick off with one of our highly popular</p>
<p>quiz questions doc there it is</p>
<p>all right what do Americas eat more of</p>
<p>hamburgers or hot dogs</p>
<p>I have an opinion but we&rsquo;ll leave that</p>
<p>to the audience and then why don&rsquo;t we uh</p>
<p>now go uh to our our guests and we just</p>
<p>got Greg</p>
<p>Horseman back he had sort of disappeared</p>
<p>for a while and Greg we&rsquo;re going to put</p>
<p>you on uh with Dr Berg please unmute</p>
<p>yourself and you&rsquo;re wrong with Dr Berg</p>
<p>okay I think I&rsquo;m unmuted is is that good</p>
<p>you sound terrific that&rsquo;s great great</p>
<p>well I appreciate the uh the opportunity</p>
<p>Dr berga I&rsquo;ve been actually uh onto your</p>
<p>program really since Christmas day uh</p>
<p>last year and uh I&rsquo;ve lost a</p>
<p>considerable amount of body fat and</p>
<p>weight uh and I&rsquo;m really pleased with</p>
<p>the results I&rsquo;m actually feeling really</p>
<p>good these days</p>
<p>and uh but I&rsquo;ve got a few issues that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to share with you and I&rsquo;d like</p>
<p>to get your thoughts on them to tell me</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m missing the boat first off I</p>
<p>want to mention instead of doing omad I</p>
<p>do om EOD most of the time which is one</p>
<p>meal every other day and so that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>a pretty consistent Trend that I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>on really since December uh but I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>also experimented with longer fasting</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve said in some of your</p>
<p>videos that hey if you&rsquo;re not hungry and</p>
<p>you can push this out go ahead and push</p>
<p>it out so I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve really tried to push</p>
<p>the limit I&rsquo;ve gone as many as four days</p>
<p>in a row without eating anything and no</p>
<p>issue but then I think maybe I should</p>
<p>eat something just to be safe so anyway</p>
<p>the the symptoms that I&rsquo;ve experienced</p>
<p>since I&rsquo;ve started this path that are</p>
<p>not real favorable is I have experienced</p>
<p>extreme leg cramps from really the knee</p>
<p>down and it wakes me up from a dead</p>
<p>sleep and I have to stand up to get it</p>
<p>to ease up and then once it eases up I</p>
<p>can lay back down and and it follows the</p>
<p>cycle it&rsquo;s about every two hours and</p>
<p>usually when I wake up I end up going</p>
<p>and urinating too but I was sleeping</p>
<p>through the night before when I was</p>
<p>heavier which don&rsquo;t get me wrong I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>trade off the heavy for uh not sleeping</p>
<p>well but but uh I I&rsquo;ve gotten so much</p>
<p>energy that I don&rsquo;t want to stop and</p>
<p>sometimes even lay down and sleep and I</p>
<p>know you say seven or eight hours is</p>
<p>good but I find I don&rsquo;t really need that</p>
<p>so what part of that process might be</p>
<p>contributing I mean potassium I&rsquo;m eating</p>
<p>I got took I got the Magnesium uh things</p>
<p>that you offer on your website so anyway</p>
<p>okay so I think I think if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>already taking you&rsquo;re probably taking my</p>
<p>electrolytes I&rsquo;m guessing so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting a lot of potassium</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re getting also magnesium which</p>
<p>is important but there&rsquo;s one more</p>
<p>mineral that you&rsquo;re probably going to</p>
<p>take in addition which is calcium I</p>
<p>would probably find a good maybe a</p>
<p>calcium lactate and take that before bed</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>um if you&rsquo;re lacking calcium and I</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t really talked a lot about this</p>
<p>that specifically can create some tetany</p>
<p>and tightness in the lower part of your</p>
<p>legs especially when you&rsquo;re sleeping</p>
<p>nocturnal and</p>
<p>um cramping</p>
<p>um so I think that is what&rsquo;s missing</p>
<p>with you</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>um I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s potassium I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s magnesium which could be a</p>
<p>cause but especially when you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>this fasting you&rsquo;re only eating once</p>
<p>every other day</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just going to be a balance of</p>
<p>trying to figure out what mineral</p>
<p>vitamin and so</p>
<p>you know calcium</p>
<p>is not something that is uh</p>
<p>easy to get from unless you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>some Dairy and a lot of vegetables but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating once every other day so I</p>
<p>think what&rsquo;ll happen if you right before</p>
<p>bed if you took like a good calcium</p>
<p>lactate that cramping would go away</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so the other thing too would be vitamin</p>
<p>D to increase the absorption of calcium</p>
<p>so the combination of both of those I</p>
<p>think you might already be taking</p>
<p>vitamin D but calcium is probably the</p>
<p>missing</p>
<p>before I started I was drinking</p>
<p>generally three to four glasses of milk</p>
<p>and when I read the milk carton that</p>
<p>said sugar I said well that&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m done</p>
<p>with that so I did stop drinking the</p>
<p>milk uh you know when I started the</p>
<p>program so calcium might be might be</p>
<p>right up my alley I think that I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re missing you know</p>
<p>even from a cardiovascular standpoint</p>
<p>you have the heart muscle itself if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have enough calcium</p>
<p>um boy do you have a problem with the</p>
<p>heart I mean and if you have too much</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the problem too that&rsquo;s why you</p>
<p>have calcium channel blockers but um</p>
<p>I think even one of the side effects</p>
<p>from a calcium channel blocker which</p>
<p>actually creates a deficiency would be</p>
<p>leg cramps so</p>
<p>um I think it&rsquo;s a real simple answer for</p>
<p>you so go ahead and try that take some</p>
<p>calcium before bed and let us know if</p>
<p>that helped I think that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>what you need to do</p>
<p>and then maybe on the days that you eat</p>
<p>have some consume some cheese some high</p>
<p>quality cheese and see if that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>help you but I think any symptoms that</p>
<p>occur with um more of a prolonged fast</p>
<p>gives us a clue on what your body might</p>
<p>be having a subclinical deficiency</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re putting the body into a</p>
<p>state where</p>
<p>All These Little Things show up now that</p>
<p>might maybe didn&rsquo;t show up before</p>
<p>well I got to tell you in terms of the</p>
<p>way I feel I&rsquo;m energetic I don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>nearly the brain fog that I felt was</p>
<p>beginning to grow uh for me and I got to</p>
<p>tell you I mean like I said I wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>trade it any of these little symptoms</p>
<p>for what I had before but I thought</p>
<p>maybe you could help me out I appreciate</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>this is awesome great</p>
<p>appreciate your success awesome that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great thanks so much Greg and uh uh what</p>
<p>a wonderful success story uh pruned off</p>
<p>all that weight uh why don&rsquo;t we discuss</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s watching us around the world so a</p>
<p>good morning to all our viewers joining</p>
<p>us from the UK Canada Jordan Yugoslavia</p>
<p>hang on I just jumped up for me uh I ran</p>
<p>Kuwait Algeria France Greece Italy India</p>
<p>Japan Pakistan Germany Cameroon Chile</p>
<p>Trinidad Tobago the Netherlands Scotland</p>
<p>Taiwan Iraq Lebanon Uzbekistan uh</p>
<p>Istanbul Egypt Kurdistan Mexico and by</p>
<p>the way we&rsquo;ve got a guest coming up</p>
<p>later in the show Daniel representing</p>
<p>Mexico City so we&rsquo;re excited about that</p>
<p>uh Suriname haven&rsquo;t heard of them before</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s a great place Israel</p>
<p>Sweden Zambia Norway the Philippines</p>
<p>Brazil Peru Switzerland Thailand and all</p>
<p>the costs of course these United States</p>
<p>and did he say Canada if he didn&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>throw that in so that is fantastic and</p>
<p>all of these people have cumulatively</p>
<p>worked on the quiz question and the quiz</p>
<p>question asks what do Americans eat more</p>
<p>of uh hamburgers and hot dogs I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>guessing hamburgers maybe because I slam</p>
<p>a lot of them down and let&rsquo;s see um</p>
<p>so 65 say the boyger 35 say hot dogs are</p>
<p>they onto something doc</p>
<p>well they are on to something it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about 14 billion now honestly I I uh</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s conflicting data on that but I</p>
<p>will say that there&rsquo;s like a 14 billion</p>
<p>to a 9 billion but again</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s conflicting data down there but</p>
<p>we do know Steve and this is such an</p>
<p>important question that people in the</p>
<p>U.S eat more hamburgers and this relates</p>
<p>to the video that I did I released</p>
<p>yesterday on</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>incredible if you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re consuming</p>
<p>burgers at a fast food uh restaurant</p>
<p>like I did Growing Up Until I was like</p>
<p>28 years old which was about five years</p>
<p>ago</p>
<p>um I</p>
<p>basically accumulated so much corn in My</p>
<p>DNA I mean even the burger itself is</p>
<p>like 93 corn derived because of the the</p>
<p>corn fed</p>
<p>um cows so um and then of course it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>GMO so we&rsquo;re putting all this stuff into</p>
<p>our bodies</p>
<p>um at a foundational</p>
<p>DNA level which um I don&rsquo;t know I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s the best thing to uh</p>
<p>to build our bodies out of corn uh Steve</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the best foundation</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>um the point is that uh</p>
<p>if you if you can do it make your</p>
<p>Burgers grass-fed at home without the</p>
<p>bun because there&rsquo;s a lot of additional</p>
<p>things in there that come from corn too</p>
<p>like the high fructose corn syrup</p>
<p>so-called ketchup</p>
<p>and then of course the soda and the corn</p>
<p>oil that they fry the fries and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>incredible there&rsquo;s a great um</p>
<p>documentary I think it&rsquo;s called King</p>
<p>Corn</p>
<p>fascinating you got to check that out</p>
<p>very interesting let&rsquo;s go to Facebook</p>
<p>Iona says please share she&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>personal here please share what</p>
<p>supplements you take every day Dr bird</p>
<p>um you know I I rotate and depending on</p>
<p>what I need but I I right now the sun&rsquo;s</p>
<p>coming out so I don&rsquo;t take my D3 anymore</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m getting enough Sun but I</p>
<p>usually take the D3 and K2</p>
<p>um I also in the morning I take a whole</p>
<p>lemon and stick it in the blender with a</p>
<p>glass of water a big glass of water and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put a scoop of my um electrolyte</p>
<p>powder in there uh with another scoop of</p>
<p>wheatgrass juice powder so now I have</p>
<p>the chlorophyll</p>
<p>phytonutrients and and then I take my</p>
<p>trace minerals because I actually spiked</p>
<p>it recently with a little bit more zinc</p>
<p>copper malignant manganese things like</p>
<p>that and so that&rsquo;s pretty much what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing lately it seems to work out real</p>
<p>good but then you know other times I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go to my probiotic I&rsquo;ll start</p>
<p>taking a probiotic a little bit of that</p>
<p>and uh I might rotate sometimes to a</p>
<p>sleep a before bed but I don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>need that anymore I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>just go right out and and sometimes I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>take my nutritional yeast before bed as</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>and then when I&rsquo;m exercising not lightly</p>
<p>but I used to take the the keto energy</p>
<p>which used to be called the</p>
<p>mitochondrial support just because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a real high quality B1 product with in a</p>
<p>blend of all the nutrients that</p>
<p>definitely increases your energy if you</p>
<p>need more energy when you&rsquo;re working out</p>
<p>um the latest workout that I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>be recommending I&rsquo;ll be doing videos on</p>
<p>it you know I kind of rotate I find some</p>
<p>new workout and I&rsquo;m like wow this is</p>
<p>awesome the sled</p>
<p>the sled</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s a really great uh guy out</p>
<p>there that I I&rsquo;m going to interview at</p>
<p>the end of this month it&rsquo;s called the</p>
<p>toes over knee guy and he recommends a</p>
<p>sled I got a little sled you&rsquo;re not that</p>
<p>expensive and boy you want a workout</p>
<p>the sled for your knees you go backwards</p>
<p>incredible cardiovascular and leg</p>
<p>workout and that&rsquo;s the one that I&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>doing a video on very soon but uh</p>
<p>um definitely want to check that out</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty pretty cool stuff very</p>
<p>interesting I can see Karen on there</p>
<p>with a whistle yelling at you as you</p>
<p>shove her across the field hey I got her</p>
<p>to do it too because um it&rsquo;s especially</p>
<p>good for people that have knee problems</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling it for your back because it</p>
<p>kind of reverses the whole flow like</p>
<p>instead of doing like this squats</p>
<p>um it blows out your discs um this this</p>
<p>works on your</p>
<p>the different different muscles that</p>
<p>strengthen your back and so if you do it</p>
<p>like if you have back pain and you have</p>
<p>a lumbar support maybe even a rolled</p>
<p>towel or something like this if you do a</p>
<p>lot of sitting</p>
<p>a little</p>
<p>thing you can get from</p>
<p>Kmart or Walmart whatever and you keep</p>
<p>that in your lower back keep the curve</p>
<p>in the lower back and then you do the</p>
<p>backward pull with that sled you will</p>
<p>not have back pain because the</p>
<p>foundation of your feet your knees your</p>
<p>quads your hip</p>
<p>um all will support that nice curve in</p>
<p>your lower back versus</p>
<p>sitting all day which just loses the</p>
<p>curb and then you get back pain</p>
<p>wow I can&rsquo;t wait to see that video</p>
<p>ambreen from Facebook my mom is a</p>
<p>diabetic and her feet get painful</p>
<p>especially at night time can you explain</p>
<p>what I can do to make her feel better</p>
<p>you can immediately you know for</p>
<p>immediately relief you can get something</p>
<p>called benphotamine it&rsquo;s a fat soluble B</p>
<p>vitamin take just four of those a day</p>
<p>spread them out and within probably a</p>
<p>few days you&rsquo;ll start feeling relief but</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening is she needs to reduce</p>
<p>her blood sugars she needs to get off</p>
<p>these things called what do they call</p>
<p>them carbohydrates and then go on keto</p>
<p>intermittent fasting because it&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>high sugar that&rsquo;s creating</p>
<p>damage to her vascular system</p>
<p>that then feed the nerves to the lower</p>
<p>part of the feet so her nerves are</p>
<p>basically</p>
<p>dying because they don&rsquo;t have enough</p>
<p>blood flow</p>
<p>because what sugar does to the vascular</p>
<p>system and nasty and it destroys your</p>
<p>eyes your heart your kidneys and your</p>
<p>nerves</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s a bummer Todd from YouTube</p>
<p>is a good question would any of your</p>
<p>products break a fast my friend is in</p>
<p>menopause asking for a friend and is</p>
<p>struggling to lose weight and she takes</p>
<p>a lot of your products</p>
<p>uh the only product that we break fast</p>
<p>is the meal replacement or the keto</p>
<p>Shake because it has protein all the</p>
<p>other ones won&rsquo;t break the fast at all</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re very very low</p>
<p>calories and they don&rsquo;t have carbs and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not I do have an amino acid product</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s different than the branch amino</p>
<p>acids that you would get that turn in</p>
<p>the sugar</p>
<p>this blend of amino acids is a very</p>
<p>unique blend that replaces your protein</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t turn in the sugar maybe one</p>
<p>percent of it does but it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>insignificant compared to all other</p>
<p>proteins out there okay how about</p>
<p>another question</p>
<p>all right good what&rsquo;s the primary side</p>
<p>effect</p>
<p>of electrolytes on the heart</p>
<p>so what&rsquo;s the number one symptom you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to get within your cardiovascular</p>
<p>system if you&rsquo;re deficient in</p>
<p>electrolytes</p>
<p>all right terrific well we spoke of</p>
<p>Mexico before and we have Daniel</p>
<p>Dominguez standing by to represent the</p>
<p>city and ask a question of Dr Byrd</p>
<p>Daniel you&rsquo;re on with Dr Berg</p>
<p>go ahead sir</p>
<p>hey doctor a pleasure following</p>
<p>following work from Mexico City and well</p>
<p>my question is this uh three months ago</p>
<p>I started keto and uh fasting because I</p>
<p>developed this thing called leaky God</p>
<p>and back in December the</p>
<p>neuroinflammation and the brain fog was</p>
<p>10 out of 10 I was feeling drugged and</p>
<p>high all the time my wife and I got</p>
<p>really scared I couldn&rsquo;t drive couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>go to the mall by myself because I was</p>
<p>all foggy all the time and well after a</p>
<p>doctor told me keto fasting and natural</p>
<p>supplements three months later so far so</p>
<p>good I&rsquo;m coming back being myself but</p>
<p>every now and then</p>
<p>um I get after a meal or after working</p>
<p>out I get the brain fog back</p>
<p>and migraines on the right side of my</p>
<p>head so my wife and I are wondering like</p>
<p>which is that last step I&rsquo;m missing for</p>
<p>my total healing</p>
<p>uh should I Target you know the</p>
<p>digestive system should I Target the</p>
<p>brain</p>
<p>um basically that&rsquo;s my question because</p>
<p>so far you know thyroid</p>
<p>uh blood tests hormone test everything</p>
<p>looks fine and the doctors are like okay</p>
<p>we have no idea what else to do with you</p>
<p>right and this relates to exercise right</p>
<p>yeah every time I exercise or or every</p>
<p>time I finish a meal let&rsquo;s say the</p>
<p>breakfast the brain fog tries to come</p>
<p>back and the migraines just show up</p>
<p>yeah I think here&rsquo;s the thing that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re running up against you you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>fully adapted to fat</p>
<p>like you should yet and that does take</p>
<p>it takes time it takes between one and</p>
<p>three months especially if you&rsquo;re work</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re an athlete</p>
<p>um sometimes it could take up to eight</p>
<p>months because these athletes</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that are relying on so much sugar over a</p>
<p>period of time and all of a sudden you</p>
<p>switch to a keto it&rsquo;s like what your</p>
<p>body&rsquo;s like wait a second those enzymes</p>
<p>that have to develop within the muscles</p>
<p>and the tissues</p>
<p>um have to adapt and it takes a good</p>
<p>amount of time so without that uh</p>
<p>instant sugar that your body is supposed</p>
<p>to be making you and you stress the body</p>
<p>by exercising and it can show up as a</p>
<p>blood sugar issue just because you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t adapted so how do we fix that</p>
<p>well number one we have patience we wait</p>
<p>but we also do longer fast so you want</p>
<p>to not have a breakfast so you want to</p>
<p>just do two meals and try to squish them</p>
<p>so if you could work up to 18 hour fast</p>
<p>or even 20 hour fasting you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>get there a lot faster now in the</p>
<p>meantime</p>
<p>what you should do is you should um when</p>
<p>you work out just take a little bit of a</p>
<p>maybe a teaspoon of MCT oil before the</p>
<p>workout that will give your brain</p>
<p>ketones and probably minimize the side</p>
<p>effect</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s all you have to do is just</p>
<p>kind of keep working on lowering your</p>
<p>carbs fast longer give it more time and</p>
<p>then make sure you&rsquo;re doing some sea</p>
<p>salt too because the sea salts if</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re deficient can cause a bit of a</p>
<p>headache</p>
<p>um but I think it&rsquo;s really just you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t adapted to 100 fat burning yet</p>
<p>perfect so basically uh patience another</p>
<p>warning about my brain just blowing up</p>
<p>correct and then just fast longer too</p>
<p>and definitely skip your breakfast</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the way you know you&rsquo;re fat adapted is</p>
<p>like wow I don&rsquo;t really even need to eat</p>
<p>I can keep going for long periods of</p>
<p>time without any hunger then then you</p>
<p>know your body&rsquo;s working</p>
<p>sounds great thank you so much I</p>
<p>appreciate your work and thank you for</p>
<p>the help and thank you for making me</p>
<p>um appear today here thank you so much</p>
<p>hey you&rsquo;re welcome and I do know that um</p>
<p>I think that you can get higher quality</p>
<p>avocados in Mexico as compared to here</p>
<p>and I think uh even some of your food is</p>
<p>higher quality so I think you have a</p>
<p>unfair Advantage those people in the US</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s good I would ride the wave</p>
<p>and uh</p>
<p>after your meals just stick another</p>
<p>avocado in there and you&rsquo;re good to go</p>
<p>perfect sounds great thank you so much</p>
<p>okay well they might have good avocados</p>
<p>but apparently they don&rsquo;t have as good</p>
<p>weather today it&rsquo;s actually warmer in</p>
<p>Wilmington North Carolina than it is</p>
<p>Mexico City they&rsquo;ve got some little cold</p>
<p>front so I&rsquo;m feeling sort of</p>
<p>um you know proud of that effect usually</p>
<p>is so gorgeous down there and I tell you</p>
<p>what we have the answer to the second</p>
<p>quiz question which asks what is the</p>
<p>primary effect of electrolytes on the</p>
<p>heart and 80 percent said heart</p>
<p>palpitations 20 say lower blood pressure</p>
<p>Okay so</p>
<p>80 palpitations that would be a heart</p>
<p>arrhythmia symptom and yes heart</p>
<p>arrhythmias is the is the first thing to</p>
<p>show up with a lack of electrolytes but</p>
<p>you can also have blood pressure as well</p>
<p>but um the big one is the um Electro</p>
<p>arrhythmias</p>
<p>um so the heart goes out of balance when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re lacking electrolytes which you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s really bizarre to me is that</p>
<p>if you go to the doctor</p>
<p>um do they ever recommend electrolytes</p>
<p>no</p>
<p>they recommend medication for the</p>
<p>rhythmia and what would that be that</p>
<p>well first of all it might be a diuretic</p>
<p>possibly and what is the side effect of</p>
<p>diuretics</p>
<p>deficiency of potassium magnesium</p>
<p>and the retention of calcium which then</p>
<p>causes arrhythmias and then they might</p>
<p>also put you on um</p>
<p>a calcium channel blocker which has a</p>
<p>similar effect so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>that the solution</p>
<p>ends up creating the problem you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to solve</p>
<p>I mean it just doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me</p>
<p>so I will be releasing the video maybe</p>
<p>in two days on that topic maybe tomorrow</p>
<p>um but uh</p>
<p>this fascinating</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>cardiovascular electrolyte connection</p>
<p>and when you really understand it it</p>
<p>really becomes simple it&rsquo;s like wow</p>
<p>no wonder I have arrhythmias</p>
<p>I need more of this food whatever so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>unfortunately</p>
<p>everything is designed not to correct</p>
<p>the root issue</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s unfortunate now this one&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little earthy walking Mall uh as they</p>
<p>call themselves from Facebook I have</p>
<p>PCOS and have been having recurring</p>
<p>boils in my armpits and groin area what</p>
<p>could be the cause help</p>
<p>polycystic ovarian syndrome females</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s an androgen problem it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>excess androgens which is a testosterone</p>
<p>one of them is testosterone and the</p>
<p>solution is to lower the the key hormone</p>
<p>that raises androgens and that would be</p>
<p>insulin so you want to reduce insulin if</p>
<p>you have too much insulin guess what</p>
<p>else you get boils so</p>
<p>um if you get on healthy keto and do the</p>
<p>fasting</p>
<p>um you can kill two birds with one stone</p>
<p>both of these conditions</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s the solution I have a lot of</p>
<p>videos on PCOS but um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how you do it terrific I think</p>
<p>this is an oft asked question Aries from</p>
<p>Facebook what are your thoughts on the</p>
<p>carnivore carnivore excuse me Diet</p>
<p>well I honestly I think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>for especially those digestive problems</p>
<p>that people have that have got</p>
<p>inflammation</p>
<p>um personally I&rsquo;m not changing my</p>
<p>program to a carnivore because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of benefits to vegetables</p>
<p>that I I that I had found to be helpful</p>
<p>for people and so</p>
<p>um to cut out all vegetables you have</p>
<p>the fiber the feed the microbes you have</p>
<p>the vitamin C the potassium and not only</p>
<p>that but all the phytonutrients the</p>
<p>carotenoids the phenols polyphenols</p>
<p>indol-3 for anti-cancer there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>benefits I feel better when I consume</p>
<p>vegetables but also I need my protein</p>
<p>um so I I&rsquo;m not in any shape where form</p>
<p>a vegan or even a vegetarian I have a</p>
<p>lot of protein enough not excessive but</p>
<p>I also have a lot of vegetables so I</p>
<p>have the best of both worlds but if you</p>
<p>feel worse from vegetables then try the</p>
<p>carnivore and see if it doesn&rsquo;t help you</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s great I hope we can help</p>
<p>Victoria because she&rsquo;s had diarrhea for</p>
<p>three years and his diarrhea and has</p>
<p>been on keto for three years what&rsquo;s she</p>
<p>doing wrong</p>
<p>well I don&rsquo;t know but it&rsquo;s dangerous to</p>
<p>have diarrhea um that long</p>
<p>um especially with the deficiency of</p>
<p>zinc and electrolytes</p>
<p>um so obviously she needs to get a stool</p>
<p>sample she needs to take the right</p>
<p>probiotic and evaluate what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>and you might want to quickly radically</p>
<p>change different things in your diet</p>
<p>sometimes even</p>
<p>vegetables can create diarrhea or</p>
<p>sometimes um other foods can create</p>
<p>diarrhea but there&rsquo;s definitely</p>
<p>something odd going on a good simple</p>
<p>remedy that I use for diarrhea I</p>
<p>recommend would be</p>
<p>non-um sweetened</p>
<p>kefir with some blackberries you blend</p>
<p>that up</p>
<p>Slug it down and that usually helps to</p>
<p>reduce</p>
<p>um diarrhea</p>
<p>well we wish you all the best Victorian</p>
<p>that does sound serious so let&rsquo;s see uh</p>
<p>Catalina from Facebook what is the what</p>
<p>is good to treat restless leg syndrome</p>
<p>that is usually a buildup of something</p>
<p>called lactic acid or you might have a</p>
<p>version of what&rsquo;s called lactic acidosis</p>
<p>so the the remedy is to take more B1</p>
<p>thiamine so you would get it in a</p>
<p>nutritional yeast I used to have that</p>
<p>problem too and it usually comes from</p>
<p>consuming too many carbs like I did so I</p>
<p>would have to get up in the middle of</p>
<p>night and literally pound my legs they</p>
<p>had so much energy I couldn&rsquo;t sleep they</p>
<p>were restless I would literally go</p>
<p>running at five o&rsquo;clock in the morning</p>
<p>um when I was I should have been</p>
<p>sleeping of course now I wake up a lot</p>
<p>earlier because I don&rsquo;t need as much</p>
<p>sleep but yeah that restless leg is a is</p>
<p>a B1 deficiency and you have too much</p>
<p>lactic acid generation and um</p>
<p>uh simple remedy is just take some B1</p>
<p>through nutritional yeast</p>
<p>wonderful well all those folks in United</p>
<p>States enjoy getting your products with</p>
<p>ease and affordably and I understand doc</p>
<p>that you have available all around the</p>
<p>world you want to talk about your new</p>
<p>sort of product availability yeah if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re from from other parts</p>
<p>of the country other than other parts of</p>
<p>the world</p>
<p>excluding U.S we now have we&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>different places so we&rsquo;ll put those</p>
<p>links down below so you can definitely</p>
<p>save on shipping costs so and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>working on that more and more so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the costs will be coming down as time</p>
<p>goes on</p>
<p>all right well James from YouTube back</p>
<p>to YouTube uh do you believe ionizers</p>
<p>are good what are the benefits of using</p>
<p>one</p>
<p>the Inez is a really good because they</p>
<p>um they can really help certain uh</p>
<p>particles pollution in the air</p>
<p>um especially if like let&rsquo;s say you work</p>
<p>at a nail salon and you have all these</p>
<p>chemicals a good ionizer will just kind</p>
<p>of purify the air it purifies uh things</p>
<p>in the air and also</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know in certain concentrations I</p>
<p>think it can help you but if it&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>concentrated it definitely can irritate</p>
<p>your throat and things like that so the</p>
<p>right concentration I think is a good</p>
<p>way to uh kill off things in the air if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a mold growing in the air you</p>
<p>know or what are chemicals or you live</p>
<p>in a polluted area pollution is one one</p>
<p>trigger for blood sugar issues too which</p>
<p>is wild so depending on your air quality</p>
<p>you may want to get an ionizer</p>
<p>well I love all these names people come</p>
<p>up with for social media next up</p>
<p>destined to play from YouTube I have</p>
<p>Cushing syndrome and I need to lose</p>
<p>belly fat and build muscle I also have a</p>
<p>moon face not sure what that is what</p>
<p>should I do now</p>
<p>well I just happened to have</p>
<p>this book right here Steve</p>
<p>Frank Netter encyclopedia and</p>
<p>endocrinology here&rsquo;s Cushing&rsquo;s syndrome</p>
<p>right here wow okay that&rsquo;s uh highlight</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s high level of cortisol and I have</p>
<p>a whole</p>
<p>recommendation on that if you look don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t try to search for um</p>
<p>Cushing search for adrenal body type we</p>
<p>need to help you reduce stress and a</p>
<p>couple things right off the bat would be</p>
<p>for you know even better than exercise</p>
<p>is physical work around the house</p>
<p>outside not in the in the house but</p>
<p>outside being in nature going for long</p>
<p>walks gets your mind off the problems of</p>
<p>the of</p>
<p>in your life and then also the</p>
<p>nutritional yeast is essential potassium</p>
<p>foods are essential</p>
<p>um and vitamin D is really important</p>
<p>because that can act to help reduce</p>
<p>stress and bring your mood up so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I would do there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>more to that so watch my videos on the</p>
<p>adrenal body type</p>
<p>wow that&rsquo;s unbelievable doc I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>believe you had that at your fingers</p>
<p>tips uh audience I promise we did not</p>
<p>preemptively tell him what this question</p>
<p>was it just popped up</p>
<p>and uh by the way this is interesting I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what I can show here but uh</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole Cadre of people that</p>
<p>feel that our show is not live and they</p>
<p>talked about that last week and they</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;re pre-recorded and let me see</p>
<p>if I can show them today&rsquo;s questions I</p>
<p>want them to know that I mean we</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t mind producing it non-live or</p>
<p>live to tape as they call it but we</p>
<p>really are coming to you live and we are</p>
<p>watching your questions live and asking</p>
<p>them so for those of you who have date</p>
<p>he was hard proof of the fact that the</p>
<p>show is live I don&rsquo;t have a newspaper to</p>
<p>hold up but this is the second best</p>
<p>thing</p>
<p>Steve why don&rsquo;t you just tell them these</p>
<p>are paid actors that we have coming on</p>
<p>asking questions in the in the green</p>
<p>room and this is all pre-recorded and</p>
<p>rehearsed</p>
<p>um you can tell by</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>the polished answers right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right I&rsquo;m a a Japanese robot that</p>
<p>has been imported to mimic Steve and</p>
<p>anyway so that&rsquo;s how we fool all you</p>
<p>folks but no the Dr Burke Show is indeed</p>
<p>live and sometimes I hate to tell you</p>
<p>can tow because all of a sudden</p>
<p>something will happen we go off the air</p>
<p>for a second and that would never happen</p>
<p>with a pre-recorded show so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>further proof all right let&rsquo;s get back</p>
<p>to business here with the next question</p>
<p>this is a true falser</p>
<p>okay whole grains are high in fibers</p>
<p>that true or false</p>
<p>All Right audience digging it I tell you</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re lightning fast they come back</p>
<p>with the answer uh just immediately all</p>
<p>right why don&rsquo;t we go back to</p>
<p>um our green room and Eric is coming to</p>
<p>us from Fort Myer Florida also a place</p>
<p>with terrific weather and Eric you are</p>
<p>on with Dr bird</p>
<p>Dr Berg uh thanks for having me on your</p>
<p>show uh first off uh long time listener</p>
<p>uh was introduced to this over two years</p>
<p>ago I&rsquo;ve lost over 40 pounds on uh you</p>
<p>know one meal a day and keto and</p>
<p>following a lot of your recommendations</p>
<p>and all the supplements and everything</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re talking about I use on a</p>
<p>regular basis so big fan and so thank</p>
<p>you it&rsquo;s changed my life dramatically uh</p>
<p>and in the process there&rsquo;s two things</p>
<p>that um are persisting with me that are</p>
<p>unusual uh and I wanted to get your</p>
<p>opinion on this number one is uh</p>
<p>genetically unpredisposed to gout uh as</p>
<p>part of my DNA and it&rsquo;s been re</p>
<p>recurring more as a part of the program</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m on than I have ever had before</p>
<p>in my life and besides abstinence of all</p>
<p>the key things that cause you know uh</p>
<p>gout you know and I&rsquo;m I like alcohol I</p>
<p>you know I still partake in those types</p>
<p>of things I&rsquo;m curious of your point of</p>
<p>view on that so I&rsquo;d like to get that the</p>
<p>second part of my question is on another</p>
<p>piece too it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;ve also had</p>
<p>intermittent constipation as a part of</p>
<p>this program as well and you know I do a</p>
<p>lot of the you know vegetables combined</p>
<p>with uh proteins and pretty consistent</p>
<p>very drink a lot of water every day as</p>
<p>well so you know something&rsquo;s causing</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not quite sure what might</p>
<p>be the root of that so there&rsquo;s my two</p>
<p>questions and I&rsquo;d love to hear your</p>
<p>point of view okay with the constipation</p>
<p>do you um</p>
<p>are you consuming enough vegetables you</p>
<p>feel</p>
<p>mostly yes I mean I&rsquo;ll eat a huge salad</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve had people look at me when they</p>
<p>see the salad you can go I can&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating a whole salad right so</p>
<p>right I do a lot and perhaps you know uh</p>
<p>at some point when I don&rsquo;t or when I do</p>
<p>have the constipation there might you</p>
<p>know be lulls in the uh you know what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually eating so I can&rsquo;t quite</p>
<p>pinpoint it</p>
<p>okay so a couple things um that help</p>
<p>constipation</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>one is uh maybe a try a different</p>
<p>probiotic that would be one thing</p>
<p>um maybe have more fermented vegetables</p>
<p>as part of your salad the other thing is</p>
<p>uh the purified bile salts</p>
<p>um that that tends to um</p>
<p>a lot of times replace the bile that you</p>
<p>might not you might be missing in the</p>
<p>liver and that helps lubricate the colon</p>
<p>so these are just things I would look at</p>
<p>now shifting gears to gout</p>
<p>um yeah you&rsquo;re right alcohol is a</p>
<p>trigger I don&rsquo;t know if you consume</p>
<p>chocolate whether it&rsquo;s keto friendly or</p>
<p>not okay good</p>
<p>um purines are a problem but when you do</p>
<p>fasting you know your your your gas to</p>
<p>just go up one thing</p>
<p>two things you can do if you could get</p>
<p>your pH maybe get a a pH tester you</p>
<p>could probably buy them on Amazon</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re little</p>
<p>actually just get it it&rsquo;s like their</p>
<p>little urine sticks and they tell you</p>
<p>various things about your urine and one</p>
<p>of those things would be pH and</p>
<p>see what your pH is if your pH is um</p>
<p>like five which it probably is then</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably why you&rsquo;re getting gout</p>
<p>we want to bring up to a six maybe a 6.5</p>
<p>um and so how do we do that</p>
<p>um you might need to alkalize with</p>
<p>potassium citrate like through the day</p>
<p>have a little bit more potassium citrate</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an alkalizer that&rsquo;s what the</p>
<p>vegetables will help as well</p>
<p>um the other remedy that&rsquo;s good for gout</p>
<p>is tart cherries I think that is a</p>
<p>supplement</p>
<p>okay good you might want to try to</p>
<p>find</p>
<p>um and not go crazy with them but to</p>
<p>find</p>
<p>freeze-dried tart cherries</p>
<p>and have those after your dinner</p>
<p>especially if you get gout late at night</p>
<p>or just during the day or does it come</p>
<p>and go or it comes and goes and when it</p>
<p>hits you know it persists and all the</p>
<p>you know symptoms that come with it and</p>
<p>then it fades over time</p>
<p>um but you know I&rsquo;d like to figure out</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m actually doing that causes it</p>
<p>and then stop doing that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely I will say there&rsquo;s a genetic</p>
<p>uh part of this and it&rsquo;s unfortunate</p>
<p>like you might if you&rsquo;re predisposed it</p>
<p>can kind of just turn on it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not even honestly the uric acid</p>
<p>crystals that are causing the pain it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the uric acid crystals that are</p>
<p>stirring up your immune system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s causing the problem so it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>immune issue</p>
<p>um you know people have tried the celery</p>
<p>seed and the um the different remedies</p>
<p>and some of those work right and some of</p>
<p>them don&rsquo;t I think the the best thing</p>
<p>that I recommend that seems to work the</p>
<p>best is just to alter the pH of your</p>
<p>urine to keep it from getting too acid</p>
<p>and not you don&rsquo;t want to alkalize it</p>
<p>too much but you may need to just bring</p>
<p>up the ph and and sometimes even when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fasting it takes some baking soda</p>
<p>a little bit like an eighth of a</p>
<p>teaspoon of water drink that down in the</p>
<p>middle of your fast</p>
<p>alkalize it so it reduces some of that</p>
<p>acidity that that might help</p>
<p>um reduce the pain but I think it&rsquo;s time</p>
<p>for me to do like more of an in-depth</p>
<p>video on gout because it is definitely a</p>
<p>popular problem with a lot of people so</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;ll do more of a complete video on</p>
<p>that soon</p>
<p>all right appreciate the input thank you</p>
<p>very much thanks Eric well best of luck</p>
<p>Eric that is a very painful and gruesome</p>
<p>problem I understand yeah especially</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re trying to exercise</p>
<p>and uh you&rsquo;re doing the the sled if you</p>
<p>have a toe pain and you&rsquo;re like you know</p>
<p>doing anything with exercise it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it throws off your gate so now your</p>
<p>pressure is on a certain part of your</p>
<p>foot and then now it messes up your knee</p>
<p>and your back so what can you really</p>
<p>throw off the whole Foundation of your</p>
<p>body wow your Eric&rsquo;s shaking his head on</p>
<p>that one okay so the audience is right</p>
<p>on it and our last uh question was a</p>
<p>true false whole grains are high in</p>
<p>fiber and sixty percent of the audience</p>
<p>say that it&rsquo;s false and forty percent</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>I mean they wherever they is promote</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s high in fiber these healthy</p>
<p>whole grains get your fiber well guess</p>
<p>what</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s roughly between</p>
<p>four</p>
<p>to ten percent it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s extremely low</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s extremely low even the whole I mean</p>
<p>not 100 Health grain is very very low</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a high fiber thing let&rsquo;s take</p>
<p>vegetables for example let&rsquo;s take celery</p>
<p>in or spinach it&rsquo;s a 50 fiber with only</p>
<p>like a per cup it&rsquo;s like a four grams of</p>
<p>carbs</p>
<p>whereas you have with the grain</p>
<p>you got this four percent fiber with</p>
<p>40 carbs</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s not a high fiber</p>
<p>food and don&rsquo;t if you want to get fiber</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get it from your grains</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;ll be releasing a video on grains</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s I think um</p>
<p>yeah so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just a lot of myths about that</p>
<p>so that would be a big fat false</p>
<p>all right well uh real quickly at one of</p>
<p>our former guests here Greg Horsemen was</p>
<p>on uh the TV so to speak he wants to</p>
<p>know if there&rsquo;s an amount of calcium</p>
<p>lactate to take each day to help his</p>
<p>issues</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have an exact amount</p>
<p>um if if you could find a lactate in</p>
<p>whatever normally comes and I would take</p>
<p>that because</p>
<p>normally the um I haven&rsquo;t tested out</p>
<p>exactly how much you need but I would</p>
<p>just try try one or two tablets but the</p>
<p>one I would not take if I were going to</p>
<p>take calcium is calcium carbonate but</p>
<p>get like a lactate or even a citrate and</p>
<p>whatever comes in if it&rsquo;s 250 milligram</p>
<p>300 milligrams gray for great that would</p>
<p>be perfect but</p>
<p>um I probably wouldn&rsquo;t go up over 300</p>
<p>but take it right before bed</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s the best time to take calcium</p>
<p>because calcium relaxes you and um also</p>
<p>um You probably get the cramps at night</p>
<p>so taking it at bed will actually help</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrific okay on to the next Quiz</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>all right so which key mineral</p>
<p>helps convert the thyroid hormone from a</p>
<p>T4 to a T3</p>
<p>okay get on that and let&rsquo;s see and by</p>
<p>the way Greg said awesome thank you and</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go on to someone that&rsquo;s on the</p>
<p>phone with us and that would be uh Ruby</p>
<p>from New York City Ruby are you</p>
<p>listening</p>
<p>hi Dr Burke thank you Stephen</p>
<p>hello how are you I&rsquo;m so sorry about my</p>
<p>camera I&rsquo;m on campus so I couldn&rsquo;t find</p>
<p>the best way to turn it on so happy</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m so happy to be on the show my</p>
<p>mom inspired me to speak with you today</p>
<p>because she is a keto follower because</p>
<p>of you</p>
<p>and so I wanted to come on today and</p>
<p>talk about my thyroid because</p>
<p>um I was recently told that I have</p>
<p>Hashimoto&rsquo;s and hyperthyroidism</p>
<p>so um I wanted to first start with</p>
<p>saying that two and a half years ago is</p>
<p>when I first started to experience</p>
<p>symptoms of like having a thyroid</p>
<p>disorder I had hair loss and heartbeats</p>
<p>and weight gain but my endocrinologist</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t like didn&rsquo;t treat me she said</p>
<p>everything was normal so I went to about</p>
<p>two years untreated so last year in 2021</p>
<p>I was told that I have hyperthyroidism</p>
<p>so I took</p>
<p>um supplements on and off and I was told</p>
<p>to stick to a diet which I didn&rsquo;t stick</p>
<p>to strictly and my stress levels and my</p>
<p>cortisol was through</p>
<p>through the roof</p>
<p>so now in February I recently took</p>
<p>another blood test and my cortisol and</p>
<p>all of my thyroid panel was doubled so</p>
<p>my red blood cell was even increased and</p>
<p>so was my my ALT so now I have a TSH of</p>
<p>0.01 the T4 of 17.5 my cortisol is 26.8</p>
<p>in the morning and my thyroid peroxide</p>
<p>antibodies is 221.</p>
<p>but I thought from my original diagnosis</p>
<p>of hypothyroidism I was feeling better</p>
<p>so in the meantime of these past three</p>
<p>two and a half weeks I went on keto I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>on a strict diet of no sugar no gluten</p>
<p>two quarts of water one cup of</p>
<p>cruciferous vegetables no carbs</p>
<p>nutritional yeast and I&rsquo;m on a bunch of</p>
<p>some new supplements now but I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>sure if these supplements are</p>
<p>like I wanted to make sure these are</p>
<p>working for me so my nutritionist told</p>
<p>me to take paba 500 milligrams thyrocom</p>
<p>cortisol manager and a liver detox</p>
<p>but I just want to make sure that</p>
<p>through this strict diet and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and through these</p>
<p>supplements that I could kind of sort of</p>
<p>bring my thyroid back to normal or</p>
<p>stabilize it just because I&rsquo;m young I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>20 and I don&rsquo;t want to go on synthetic</p>
<p>medication so I wanted your opinion</p>
<p>I got it</p>
<p>um do you do you presently go through a</p>
<p>lot of stress at school and things yes</p>
<p>yes stress at home stress at school</p>
<p>yeah so that&rsquo;s great that you&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>the supplements you&rsquo;re taking the right</p>
<p>things the the uh the the nutritional</p>
<p>yeast has the B1 which is great for a</p>
<p>hyperthyroid if you went from a hypo</p>
<p>Hashimoto&rsquo;s to then a hyper the chances</p>
<p>are it&rsquo;s really just a autoimmune issue</p>
<p>more than a thyroid issue</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so I and that can be triggered by stress</p>
<p>for sure so</p>
<p>um I think you&rsquo;re on the right path as</p>
<p>far as you&rsquo;re eating and your nutrition</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re doing a good job I think</p>
<p>the big thing that I would put attention</p>
<p>on is doing whatever you can to um</p>
<p>eliminate sources of stress in your life</p>
<p>and and um counter some of the stress by</p>
<p>the like I said previously</p>
<p>doing physical work outside you should</p>
<p>get a job where you&rsquo;re doing physical</p>
<p>work manual labor I&rsquo;m not kidding I mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like such a great therapy</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re a student sit</p>
<p>behind a computer all day like you get</p>
<p>out there in nature and do something</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s so good for your adrenals it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good for stress and if you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>something outside like start cleaning</p>
<p>something inside but</p>
<p>the stress is um what that does is it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it lower it suppresses the immune</p>
<p>system and allows these autoimmune</p>
<p>things to kick in so I think yeah take</p>
<p>the nutrition do these other things but</p>
<p>probably watch my videos on stress</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>because that is what I see is like a</p>
<p>what you need help with most uh mostly</p>
<p>and hopefully you can get through the</p>
<p>schooling fast so you can then because</p>
<p>going through school is extremely</p>
<p>stressful as I remember so um you know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to cope as well as</p>
<p>you can as you get through and then when</p>
<p>you graduate you can do other things</p>
<p>that hopefully will reduce your stress</p>
<p>okay and so but the news supplements</p>
<p>that my nutritionist told me to take the</p>
<p>paba and the liver detox and the</p>
<p>cortisol manager is that are those all</p>
<p>supplements that you think will help</p>
<p>over time I I think they&rsquo;re fine I think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fine they might help you</p>
<p>um I just don&rsquo;t have enough data to tell</p>
<p>you for sure but you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>supporting the adrenal you&rsquo;re supporting</p>
<p>the liver</p>
<p>uh paba is is also good as a B vitamin</p>
<p>so all those are are beneficial but um I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t I couldn&rsquo;t tell you because I</p>
<p>I I don&rsquo;t know those brands</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>yeah because I can&rsquo;t really give you an</p>
<p>opinion if I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have that data but I will say that</p>
<p>um going on that low carb doing them in</p>
<p>the fasting</p>
<p>is very very important</p>
<p>um another good thing</p>
<p>like lemon balm tea drinking that</p>
<p>through the day is really good for</p>
<p>cortisol to low up lower cortisol</p>
<p>vitamin D is good to lower cortisol</p>
<p>magnesium is it&rsquo;s very important for</p>
<p>cortisol because even a magnesium</p>
<p>deficiency</p>
<p>um usually occurs before you get</p>
<p>Hashimoto&rsquo;s and even other types of</p>
<p>autoimmune problems so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>consider a good magnesium</p>
<p>product as well</p>
<p>okay all right thank you so much</p>
<p>yeah good luck Ruby yeah she&rsquo;s got the</p>
<p>World by the short hair is it 20 years</p>
<p>old got a nice long life ahead of her</p>
<p>and by the way you talked about exercise</p>
<p>and and you use the example of the</p>
<p>jethros that work around your farm you</p>
<p>know they eat a moon pie and an RC Cola</p>
<p>for lunch but they&rsquo;re chucking bales of</p>
<p>hay all day and they&rsquo;re just super</p>
<p>healthy right because they just sort of</p>
<p>overcome maybe their nasty diet which is</p>
<p>constant movement</p>
<p>you know if you just weigh out the</p>
<p>different things to improve your health</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of factors to look at you</p>
<p>have diet and um there&rsquo;s other things</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s like physical activity</p>
<p>outside not on a treadmill the physical</p>
<p>activity outside I mean people tend to</p>
<p>live longer if you take a look at the um</p>
<p>the countries where people live for very</p>
<p>long they usually hang outside they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not inside playing the video games all</p>
<p>day they&rsquo;re not on the treadmill at the</p>
<p>gym they&rsquo;re outside doing physical work</p>
<p>which is such a great therapy I mean</p>
<p>just try it just try it and see if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t um you know because it affects it</p>
<p>takes your attention off the problems of</p>
<p>life when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re doing other types of work</p>
<p>that um you know you don&rsquo;t have time to</p>
<p>focus on so that shift in that shift in</p>
<p>mental focus is a very huge benefit of</p>
<p>doing physical work and cleaning</p>
<p>something or whatever</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrific all right great advice</p>
<p>uh and our audience is nailed uh answers</p>
<p>again I think quiz question number four</p>
<p>asks which key mineral helps convert T4</p>
<p>to T3 and the audience 45 percent of</p>
<p>them claim uh that it&rsquo;s selenium 35</p>
<p>percent say iodine and 20 say zinc</p>
<p>okay so this relates to the last person</p>
<p>I was just talking about which I was</p>
<p>withholding this answer which is because</p>
<p>for Hashimoto&rsquo;s you want the conversion</p>
<p>mineral and the answer is selenium</p>
<p>um one</p>
<p>um Brazilian nut per day will give you a</p>
<p>good amount of uh selenium that you</p>
<p>would need like the rdas I mean you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>get enough by having one nut a day but</p>
<p>selenium is also good in high in Seafood</p>
<p>oysters other other things clams things</p>
<p>like that but selenium is the the key</p>
<p>mineral to help convert the T4 to the T3</p>
<p>fantastic our final contestant so to</p>
<p>speak in the green room is Mia Franklin</p>
<p>by the way thank you folks because these</p>
<p>poor people have to have their faces</p>
<p>pressed to the camera for an hour</p>
<p>straight and they&rsquo;re such good sports</p>
<p>about it me is coming to us on the phone</p>
<p>so to speak Mia are you with us</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>go ahead with your question Mia</p>
<p>okay thank you Dr Berg</p>
<p>having me and um I&rsquo;ve been watching uh</p>
<p>YouTube you YouTube about you know</p>
<p>gallbladder problems and you recommend</p>
<p>um take a vile pure biosart and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to find it on uh</p>
<p>you know online but I couldn&rsquo;t find the</p>
<p>you know pure bio salt and I mean I took</p>
<p>your uh gallbladder formula for uh three</p>
<p>months straight and my</p>
<p>pain</p>
<p>oh it&rsquo;s gone and uh I don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>should I keep taking your gallbladder</p>
<p>formula</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t have a pain but I do have a</p>
<p>bio going into my stomach that cause</p>
<p>sociable uh biogastritis and the a</p>
<p>little better also</p>
<p>so did you did you say that you have a</p>
<p>fibroid</p>
<p>gastro</p>
<p>biogastritis oh okay okay so so yes the</p>
<p>gallbladder formula that you&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>the one that I have is the purified bile</p>
<p>salts that is the one that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>correct one I&rsquo;m glad it helped you</p>
<p>um so now we&rsquo;re dealing with gastritis</p>
<p>right so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I think that um the other thing that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re missing is you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>search out a good source but it&rsquo;s a zinc</p>
<p>kernel sign is good for inflammation in</p>
<p>your stomach gastritis and that will be</p>
<p>a really good remedy for you and as far</p>
<p>as vegetables go I probably would stick</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>different forms of cabbage</p>
<p>cabbage seems to be really good for</p>
<p>gastritis heartburn gerd acid reflux and</p>
<p>you can do it in different forms like</p>
<p>coleslaw without the sugar</p>
<p>uh even um cabbage shredded in your</p>
<p>salad uh or even</p>
<p>um sauerkraut so that&rsquo;s a really uh it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a unique vegetable that helps the gut</p>
<p>tremendously</p>
<p>so I think you&rsquo;re on the right track I</p>
<p>would also then</p>
<p>um work on the manual remember I have</p>
<p>the I don&rsquo;t know if you saw the video</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s I think it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>gallbladder flushing but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>actually it&rsquo;s a physical it&rsquo;s a Hands-On</p>
<p>massage of your gallbladder and your</p>
<p>pancreas and that should be on my</p>
<p>website or if you do a search on it but</p>
<p>I would be doing that through the day as</p>
<p>your digestive system calms down even</p>
<p>more because it&rsquo;s gonna you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>allow more drainage through that those</p>
<p>ducks and of course</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;re on the</p>
<p>healthy version of Keto as you&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>these supplements because the point is</p>
<p>that we want to eventually get your</p>
<p>basic eating corrected that&rsquo;s with</p>
<p>everyone because you don&rsquo;t want to be</p>
<p>dependent on anything the rest of your</p>
<p>life so the key is see-through food have</p>
<p>the right um combinations of food the</p>
<p>right timing of eating to um so your</p>
<p>body can heal</p>
<p>thank you so much but my doctor suggest</p>
<p>me to have a removable gallbladder</p>
<p>good thing it was an extra organ that</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t really need</p>
<p>yeah but uh</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m doing a lot of cabbage and the</p>
<p>only time uh bottom is when I&rsquo;m sleeping</p>
<p>at night it wakes me up because I think</p>
<p>about a while going into stomach</p>
<p>I got it okay so then that uh then I</p>
<p>would add one more thing</p>
<p>um during the day uh take with tadka</p>
<p>t-u-d-c-a I think yes I saw that video</p>
<p>you made and uh I do have a um</p>
<p>autoimmune hepatitis but this you said</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t recommend if I have a</p>
<p>label problems</p>
<p>oh no no you you want to take it</p>
<p>especially if you have a liver problem</p>
<p>is really amazing uh uh what it does to</p>
<p>the liver and it takes the stress off</p>
<p>the liver takes the inflammation off the</p>
<p>liver so so what will happen is that</p>
<p>sludge that&rsquo;s backing up into your</p>
<p>stomach causing gastritis which is from</p>
<p>bile salt more than acid</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>can Now drain properly so</p>
<p>um you take it during the day empty</p>
<p>stomach maybe once or twice with two</p>
<p>different tablets and then um</p>
<p>I bet you you would sleep and not have</p>
<p>that problem anymore</p>
<p>I would definitely know I would take a</p>
<p>tataka</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>video many times okay thank you so much</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s great thanks Mia and thanks</p>
<p>everybody for participating why don&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>try we&rsquo;ve got a few seconds left uh for</p>
<p>go to social media wrap it up there</p>
<p>Karina from YouTube will drinking raw</p>
<p>lemon juice break a fast</p>
<p>no no it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s such a small amount</p>
<p>of uh carbs that I mean you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about maybe breaking a fast for a few</p>
<p>minutes it&rsquo;s not going to be a big deal</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about it because the</p>
<p>benefit of the citrate is very good when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fasting uh especially to reduce</p>
<p>kidney stones and and oxalates in the</p>
<p>body</p>
<p>um from certain vegetables that you have</p>
<p>um one little thing I want to mention</p>
<p>instead of sauerkraut you can do kimchi</p>
<p>which also is a cabbage pepper and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really good vegetable I mean</p>
<p>not it&rsquo;s a fermented blend of really</p>
<p>good vegetables and if that&rsquo;s good for</p>
<p>sinus issues as well but um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of spicy so</p>
<p>anyway I want to just say thanks for</p>
<p>everyone for having their attention this</p>
<p>long on this video you made it to the</p>
<p>end I appreciate you</p>
<p>um stay tuned for additional videos</p>
<p>coming up every single day and um</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>um also next Friday we&rsquo;ll be back but um</p>
<p>thanks for your successes stay tuned</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk to you real soon</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>thank you</p>
