    <p>Okay, hi friends. I&rsquo;m gonna get myself in trouble with this episode maybe a little but fuck it</p>
<p>so one of you guys DM to me and asked me to do an episode about my hot takes and</p>
<p>Everything that everybody else loves that I hate and a little elaboration. So I thought it&rsquo;d be fun</p>
<p>I do want to say these are all of my opinions and you&rsquo;re allowed to have different ones</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re allowed to be wrong, but you&rsquo;re allowed to have your own opinion</p>
<p>But these are just gonna be some things that I just don&rsquo;t understand the hype around or that I just flat-out don&rsquo;t fucking like</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna start off with life things. We&rsquo;re just gonna talk about random shit that has to do with life then</p>
<p>media like TV</p>
<p>Itself shows all shit like that style and then decor and a little bit with cars</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have fun with this episode and I hope you enjoy listening to it</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s jump into this shit with just life things</p>
<p>But the first thing that I fucking hate that everybody else loves is the idea of marriage</p>
<p>No, thank you, and I kind of have two reasons why I don&rsquo;t like it one</p>
<p>Y&rsquo;all have fucked up what it means to get married</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve ruined it so many people get married now just cuz they feel like they have to</p>
<p>Like everybody feels like they have to get fucking married like two people fuck and they get pregnant by accident and they&rsquo;re like, oh my god</p>
<p>We have to get married now bitch too late too fucking late</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re supposed to get married before you fuck if you&rsquo;re trying to go but like the little Christian Bible rules girl</p>
<p>We all know what happened. We all see you. You&rsquo;re a few months late</p>
<p>But shit like that and then couples where it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>We know you aren&rsquo;t happy and we have to go and attend your wedding</p>
<p>You look a fool you look a joke and that&rsquo;s what a lot of people fucking do they get married and behind closed doors</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a shitshow like they fight they cheer on each other like everybody in the audience like out there wedding knows what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all like there to celebrate your love. You ain&rsquo;t found real love like the idea of</p>
<p>Marriage is tainted and like spoiled now people get married for the benefits that I understand</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s a lot of good benefits of getting married but like military people y&rsquo;all fucked it up</p>
<p>You just want to get married so you can be with a little person and take them wherever you want to go</p>
<p>Like marriage has become so fucked up</p>
<p>It was supposed to be a thing where like two people who are truly in love</p>
<p>found each other</p>
<p>Not two people who are like painting an image that I love each other and then are cheating on each other and then like cussing each</p>
<p>Other out like dogs the whole thing just don&rsquo;t stay right with me</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a sour taste in my mouth and I just don&rsquo;t enjoy it</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t like to go to weddings unless I&rsquo;m getting fucked up. They won&rsquo;t have fun</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go be supportive. Like I&rsquo;m gonna have my friends back. Even if I know she&rsquo;s cheating on you homeboy. Sorry</p>
<p>Sorry, you didn&rsquo;t go through her phone and catch her. You just go to my texts. We&rsquo;re fucking gossiping about it</p>
<p>But I have my friends back. So you my loyalty lies with my friend if I have a friend my loyalty lies with them</p>
<p>Sorry, bitch, but the whole idea of marriage and like the whole like stigma around it&rsquo;s a moneymaker</p>
<p>So many brands so many companies so many everything makes so much money off marriage and selling that shit to you and people just fall</p>
<p>Into it. But like I said, it&rsquo;s like the whole idea of celebrating two people who finally found true</p>
<p>Love is gone</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dead</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve never seen two people be genuinely happy that are married and not saying that marriage is supposed to be easy or that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Supposed to be happy all the time</p>
<p>But y&rsquo;all get my point a lot of people just should not be getting married and my other opinion about marriage is why the fuck</p>
<p>Am I gonna legally bind myself to somebody?</p>
<p>What the hell I understand the benefits I understand all that but it just makes it so much more messy to leave</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re your own individual person. You came into this life alone. You&rsquo;re gonna leave alone. You&rsquo;re gonna die alone</p>
<p>Why the fuck you&rsquo;re gonna go tie yourself to somebody? I don&rsquo;t like that. You can&rsquo;t control other people&rsquo;s behavior</p>
<p>So if they do something and you want to leave them for it, bitch</p>
<p>They make it so much harder like it&rsquo;s like a trap kind of and I know I&rsquo;m a little jaded and I&rsquo;m like very trust</p>
<p>No one, you know</p>
<p>Speaking to trust no one my hoodie. This is one of the designs gonna be releasing</p>
<p>It says trust no one like I have it tattooed on my wrist, but that&rsquo;s besides the point. It&rsquo;s just messy to me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good. I have no desire for marriage like the more aware you become the more</p>
<p>complex and like detailed and</p>
<p>Difficult you realize things are like there&rsquo;s so much more to shit</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the idea of like, oh, we&rsquo;ll get married</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot more to it than that, but do what you want to fucking do</p>
<p>Invite me if you have tequila</p>
<p>Okay, next thing that everybody loves that I fucking hate is how accessible and fast everything is now you can&rsquo;t see my jewelry</p>
<p>These hoodies are like the perfect length because you can still see Judy</p>
<p>It was just tucked up on my arms, but how fast things are and how readily available things are</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like it</p>
<p>like you remember when you were a kid and</p>
<p>You knew that you had like a certain TV show was like 8 7 central like you had to be home and have your ass</p>
<p>In front of a TV at 8 because your show was coming on like me with Disney Channel</p>
<p>Like whatever the fuck was coming on. I&rsquo;d like look forward to it all week</p>
<p>My show was coming like you got the anticipation. You got the excitement. You got the fun</p>
<p>You got to make it a little event like hang out with your friends watch it with your family</p>
<p>Whatever that&rsquo;s gone because you can fucking pull up Netflix or Amazon Prime or whatever buy the shit and just watch it whenever you want</p>
<p>it like the whole</p>
<p>Things being slow and not just given to you immediately like delayed gratification</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like that because that sounds like hustle culture</p>
<p>But delaying gratification with shit like it&rsquo;s it takes the excitement out of life. Like I don&rsquo;t watch TV</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t watch TV shows anymore. Like why the fuck I can do it anytime</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll get to it when I get to it</p>
<p>But you know if you have it like every week at this time you have to do it</p>
<p>Did you best catch it while you can you know?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just one example like there&rsquo;s a lot of things where everything&rsquo;s just so fast now and I don&rsquo;t like it</p>
<p>I miss like having to wait for things and for things to be exciting and to be in a little event</p>
<p>Okay, the next thing y&rsquo;all gonna get mad. I know it. I already know it pets bitch. Why the fuck do so many people?</p>
<p>Have pets like I understand you want to protect them and help them and like give them a good life cute</p>
<p>Sure, but like I don&rsquo;t like the responsibility of it like for where I am right now. I&rsquo;m 24</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people that got like pets at 18 when they went to college</p>
<p>Why the fuck are you getting a pet when you&rsquo;re going to college half of them are neglected?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re fucking half drunk all the time. You&rsquo;re not taking care of the goddamn dog</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s cute for you to have like the dog and something to look after sure</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t travel can&rsquo;t go nowhere</p>
<p>You can it&rsquo;s just like another thing to take into consideration to make shit difficult</p>
<p>Like I understand pets love pets love animals</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t understand the hype around having pets at such a young age and then people you see them</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not gonna say no more descriptive details because you know, the motherfuckers I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>They get a puppy just to parade it around like they hold the puppy when they go out in public</p>
<p>They take it every fucking where they post pictures of it and they don&rsquo;t want it when it gets old</p>
<p>Like and it gets like grown</p>
<p>They like the idea of having a puppy and having something to tote around because it gives them like attention from people people like oh</p>
<p>My god, it&rsquo;s so cute</p>
<p>Yeah, like I don&rsquo;t understand using puppies and using small animals and like young animals for attention</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fuck with that shit. If you&rsquo;re not actually gonna take the best interest of something into consideration. Don&rsquo;t fucking get it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a living thing, but I&rsquo;m gonna I&rsquo;m getting mad on that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of off track but like just the the hype around pets. I don&rsquo;t get it</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get I want a black leopard like when I have like millions of dollars once I&rsquo;ve like made it big</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get a black leopard and I have that at my house</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t tell nobody cuz I&rsquo;m not getting the certifications for it</p>
<p>But like I get pets at an older age, but like young that&rsquo;s the part I don&rsquo;t get next up</p>
<p>We got Zaxby&rsquo;s the restaurant. I don&rsquo;t get it. I don&rsquo;t understand the hype around no goddamn Zaxby&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s not good</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the Zaxby&rsquo;s sauce. I don&rsquo;t like shit from Zaxby&rsquo;s and I just wanted to put that in here</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand people are so excited. Oh my god. We&rsquo;re hungry. What do you want to go eat? And motherfucker says Zaxby&rsquo;s</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t like them. I don&rsquo;t trust them no more. I&rsquo;m putting five feet of distance between me and that person</p>
<p>Your judgment is flawed. I&rsquo;m scared of you now who the fuck likes Zaxby&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s not terrible</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s like I wouldn&rsquo;t eat it if I was starving to death. I&rsquo;d eat it but like people that prefer it. I</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t like that</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>So next thing I don&rsquo;t understand the hype around is greens powders and like greens</p>
<p>Things that like you mix into a glass of water and it&rsquo;s like a glass of shit</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s like dark green look like fucking sewer water</p>
<p>People be drinking that all the time like the flat tummy teas the detox teas the greens and you&rsquo;re like water</p>
<p>What the fuck eat a salad eat a vegetable?</p>
<p>Why the fuck are you making a glass of shitty fucking dirt water to chug it?</p>
<p>Cuz it looks aesthetic and it like looks healthy</p>
<p>Okay, I had a company send them to me and I tried them once and they taste like shit. I&rsquo;m really okay</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not investing money into it. I&rsquo;m not buying it. There&rsquo;s nothing enticing about a glass of swamp water</p>
<p>Especially in the morning. Alright, I&rsquo;m already getting a little hot because I get agitated with this shit</p>
<p>Sports that is something I do not understand for the life of me</p>
<p>What the fuck are people so into sports about like I genuinely don&rsquo;t get it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most gay shit</p>
<p>I ever seen like men so excited about other men and buy jerseys and clothes of like other men</p>
<p>What the fuck is going on? I don&rsquo;t understand. I genuinely don&rsquo;t understand sports and like people&rsquo;s addiction to it like their</p>
<p>Investment they are so emotionally invested like I wish I had something I cared about that much like how straight men care about sports</p>
<p>Ah, I wish I loved something that much maybe love your girlfriend that much</p>
<p>Things would get better but genuinely I don&rsquo;t understand it. Like if I go to a sports game of any kind, I&rsquo;ll be very into it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m invested like I&rsquo;ll be excited about like I&rsquo;m with it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like happy to be there having a good time drinking eating the pretzel or something like I&rsquo;m down for the experience</p>
<p>But like to sit at home and like fiend over like what&rsquo;s the score?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the score like people that be checking their fucking shit and like you go to dinner like I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>I have to watch the game and they like set their phone up to watch the game</p>
<p>Are you a fucking three-year-old at the restaurant with your fucking Looney Tunes on why do you need to watch the game?</p>
<p>Why are you sitting there stalking it seeing who won like I don&rsquo;t understand people&rsquo;s obsession with it</p>
<p>I genuinely have tried to understand it. I don&rsquo;t get it. I wish I cared about something that much</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t care and it&rsquo;s so pointless like there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>Nothing, like there&rsquo;s nothing to it. It&rsquo;s just watching a little game. I don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>I love when I see people get excited for them</p>
<p>No</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like when they inconvenience me</p>
<p>But I like when I see my friends like watching the game and they get happy they get excited</p>
<p>I like I&rsquo;m happy for them when I see people I care about expressing joy and having a good time</p>
<p>Makes me happy for them. I like to see it. I just don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get it. All right, next up. I&rsquo;m gonna piss a lot of you little investment bros off but investing</p>
<p>Why the fuck do I want to be a millionaire when I&rsquo;m goddamn 60 I want to be millionaire now</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t tell me to go take my money every month and go put it in this little fucking fund the S&amp;P 500</p>
<p>your fucking little stocks and shit, whatever it is</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t tell me to go put money into that and sit here and cross my fingers and hope it turns into like millions of dollars</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s when I&rsquo;m 60 who the fuck wants money when they&rsquo;re 60. I want it when I&rsquo;m 30</p>
<p>Okay, I don&rsquo;t want to be too old. I don&rsquo;t want to be some old fucking geezer with money</p>
<p>I want to enjoy it when I&rsquo;m young and you never know if it&rsquo;s actually gonna increase sure</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a track record of people putting money in a certain like bond stock. Whatever the fuck you want to call it</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know shit about investing cuz I&rsquo;m not doing it. I can make money other ways. I can make money to have it now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not putting it in some little account and being like Oh wishing for the best. Hope it grows</p>
<p>Hope I get rich like that&rsquo;s a passive way to get rich. I&rsquo;m not fucking doing it</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;d rather put my money and effort and time into like building shit making shit now so I can have the benefits now</p>
<p>I want to be 30 rolling around in a Rolls Royce not 60. What the fuck are you good for by 60?</p>
<p>Like you can&rsquo;t even walk barely. What am I gonna have a gold cane?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still gonna be on the cigarettes. But what the fuck is that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be rich like that when I&rsquo;m I don&rsquo;t want to live past 55</p>
<p>Why the fuck don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll be rich at 50, you know, and I know it&rsquo;s the safe route</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t resonate with people like living their life safe. Why are you trying to arrive at death safely?</p>
<p>I like taking risks. I like saying fuck it. You only live once like I</p>
<p>Hate to bring back YOLO, but it&rsquo;s true bitch. Like why are you gonna play the safe route?</p>
<p>Gamble investing is just a longer form of gambling. Just gamble now fast. You know, I mean, I</p>
<p>Just don&rsquo;t understand investing and people like get their fucking dick off for it. I don&rsquo;t understand truly genuinely I</p>
<p>Can make money other ways?</p>
<p>All right. Next up. We got cruises. That&rsquo;s something else. I don&rsquo;t get I</p>
<p>Would never be caught dead on a fucking cruise</p>
<p>No, bitch</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen Titanic you&rsquo;re gonna put me on a fucking floating little thing that could pop at like any minute or like hit an iceberg</p>
<p>And we all fucking go under no bitch cuz I&rsquo;m a male and I&rsquo;m very big women and children got to get on the float</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fucking dying, you know, cuz I am gonna get the women and children on the boat. I&rsquo;m gonna prioritize them putting me on a raft</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna take up the whole fucking thing. I&rsquo;m six foot seven. I&rsquo;m like 235 pounds</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna sink the bitch like I gotta save for other people instead of just me but like I know I&rsquo;m not putting myself in</p>
<p>That position to have to do that cuz I will handle it correctly, but fuck that I&rsquo;m not getting on no boat</p>
<p>What to look out and see nothing but water I know I&rsquo;m a Pisces but fuck no, no</p>
<p>I genuinely don&rsquo;t understand people&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>Obsession with cruises and don&rsquo;t fucking tell me you you don&rsquo;t feel like you&rsquo;re on a cruise like it feels like a hotel</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a fuck. I know what I&rsquo;m on a floating fucking piece of metal with a lot of other people and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not willing to take that risk. I just don&rsquo;t understand the hype around a cruise like</p>
<p>Go fucking to a bar if you want to go party</p>
<p>Go to a resort all-inclusive</p>
<p>You can stay in the one spot like cruise get fucking shit-faced dirty ugly walk to one side</p>
<p>You feel like you&rsquo;re in one country walk to the other you feel like you&rsquo;re in the next you know</p>
<p>I mean, I just don&rsquo;t get cruises. I&rsquo;m scared shitless. No</p>
<p>This last one is my last one for like life and just general things then we&rsquo;re gonna get it to media but</p>
<p>brunch</p>
<p>Everybody pops their little pussy for brunch. I don&rsquo;t get it</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like brunch because typically you have brunch after you&rsquo;ve been drinking all night</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to wake up early for it to be considered brunch</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll see you at fucking dinner if that but like people that go to brunch</p>
<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t drink that night before you&rsquo;re not hungover. Why the fuck you going to brunch?</p>
<p>You like you go to brunch people like to get shit-faced. They like to get like fucking drunk off champagne</p>
<p>I get a headache on champagne and I don&rsquo;t like to be drunk during the day</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to be seen you know, I like to be in the dark when I&rsquo;m drunk. I like to be at night</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know bro like brunches does not appeal to me to go have like breakfast food and then be drunk</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to drink a lot and then feel like I&rsquo;m nauseous with like eggs and bacon in my stomach</p>
<p>What the fuck? I don&rsquo;t know dude. I just don&rsquo;t understand brunch. Like it&rsquo;s cute. It&rsquo;s a fun idea</p>
<p>Maybe when I&rsquo;m like older, I&rsquo;ll be into it. But right now I&rsquo;ll be fucked over some brunch. No, I don&rsquo;t like it</p>
<p>Alright, let&rsquo;s talk about shows and movies and things number one anime</p>
<p>Why the fuck do so many people grown-ass adults like anime</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d be getting off to that shit like how straight men get off the sports people be getting off to anime</p>
<p>What the fuck is the deal with anime your little Naruto, whatever the hell it&rsquo;s called like your little sushi roll</p>
<p>I get the Naruto roll when I go to get sushi</p>
<p>But like what the fuck a little cartoon. I</p>
<p>Feel like that shows flawed judgment if you spend your time watching fucking anime like if y&rsquo;all like it</p>
<p>Please explain it to me because I genuinely don&rsquo;t get it and I&rsquo;m not gonna fucking watch it</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care like I do. I genuinely don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>To even try it. Do I sound like an ass a little cuz I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t like this thing</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not even gonna try it. I don&rsquo;t have to fucking try it to know I don&rsquo;t like it. It&rsquo;s a fucking cartoon</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like that. I like to live in real life reality. Not some little like</p>
<p>Fanfic shit. That&rsquo;s what I really get is</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s a fucking like, you know those little tumblr stories people used to write like a little fanfic</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I feel like anime is just like cartoonized and I know a lot of them are like with like violence not violence</p>
<p>But like fighting and shit and it&rsquo;s like they got little powers. What the fuck we&rsquo;re grown</p>
<p>grown adults</p>
<p>next up is the news and</p>
<p>Politics. I don&rsquo;t watch the news. I don&rsquo;t give a flying fuck cuz what they say is a lie big fat lie</p>
<p>They are the biggest clickbaity ass bitches</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t know where they get the information from they spew what sounds good and they&rsquo;re like, I don&rsquo;t like the news</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna waste my time. I&rsquo;m very greedy with my time. I&rsquo;m not gonna waste it on the news</p>
<p>Okay, I hate commercials on TV. I&rsquo;m not watching no guy them commercials and I&rsquo;m not watching the news. The next thing was politics. I</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know a fuck thing about politics barely know who the president is Biden. I</p>
<p>Had to think on it. Yes, who&rsquo;s the vice president?</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t tell you don&rsquo;t give a fuck. I don&rsquo;t fucking vote</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a shit about politics cuz like what for like what the fuck for what am I gonna change?</p>
<p>What am I gonna control and I know some people are gonna be like, well if everybody has that attitude, that&rsquo;s a thousand missed votes</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a fuck you can go spend your time and dedicate your life to learning about</p>
<p>politics and all these pieces, let me not all these people who are like corrupt by fucking money and</p>
<p>Feed you a bunch of horse shit. You can go learn about it. I don&rsquo;t care. I don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>I know how corrupt the system is. I&rsquo;ve experienced a little judicial system</p>
<p>Firsthand many a time and I don&rsquo;t fuck with nothing to do with court. I don&rsquo;t fuck with nothing to do with politics</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like it. I have no interest. I never have and I never will cuz like I said, what am I gonna do about it?</p>
<p>Y&rsquo;all watch the news and you watch all this shit about politics just and you get all riled up and all fussy and it fucks</p>
<p>Up your whole day. Why am I gonna do that? I&rsquo;m gonna go do something productive make some money or something. Oh</p>
<p>My god, I&rsquo;m gonna breeze past this one real quick</p>
<p>Country music. I don&rsquo;t get it. I don&rsquo;t like it. I don&rsquo;t get it. I truly don&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s so fucking whiny</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most like that southern fucking twang. I don&rsquo;t like it. It&rsquo;s just annoying to my ears and</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so fucking whiny like I don&rsquo;t like Bruno Mars cuz he&rsquo;s whiny</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like country music cuz it&rsquo;s so whiny like it&rsquo;s like the straight country man&rsquo;s fucking like</p>
<p>Way to get in touch with his feelings my dad has a joke if you play any country</p>
<p>He says if you play any country song backwards he gets his wife back he gets his dog back he gets his house</p>
<p>Cuz all country music is like men complaining about their fucking shit and their little heartbreaks and whatever like girl</p>
<p>Go fucking shoot a deer or something</p>
<p>Okay. Now I want to talk about a couple of shows. I don&rsquo;t understand the hype about I don&rsquo;t watch</p>
<p>Shows I barely watch movies. I don&rsquo;t even own a TV and this new place</p>
<p>I moved into it&rsquo;s like booze like I have to buy one cuz it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a giant hole in the wall</p>
<p>Like what the fuck am I gonna put there and there&rsquo;s like a place for a TV stand</p>
<p>So I gotta buy a TV stand and a TV. I&rsquo;m not gonna fucking turn it on</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just for looks and for when company comes over. They can watch it. I don&rsquo;t give two fucks about TV</p>
<p>I have other things to learn. Like I said, I&rsquo;m greedy with my time. I&rsquo;m not spending it watching some fucking show</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s American Horror Story. I love an American Horror Story</p>
<p>And charmed the old one charmed a show with the witches. I ate that shit up as a kid</p>
<p>I was raised on it. Me and my aunt would watch it every fucking day. I loved that shit</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen every season like ten times. I haven&rsquo;t watched the new one. I don&rsquo;t give it to fucks charmed</p>
<p>Already has like a good memory and place in my heart</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not watching a little remake because it&rsquo;s gonna tarnish it go fuck yourself</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like when people do remakes cuz they always fuck it up</p>
<p>But with certain shows I don&rsquo;t get the hype behind the office</p>
<p>Who dropped you on your head as a baby for you to find that shit funny</p>
<p>What the fuck is funny about the office that show is just the type of sense of humor</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get and I don&rsquo;t like like it&rsquo;s the most generic shit. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>You want to see something funny watch a fucking drag queen?</p>
<p>Those are the bitches with the smarts to make actual jokes that it like</p>
<p>Takes you putting two or three pieces together to get the joke and then when you get it you fucking belly laugh</p>
<p>You know what? I mean? I don&rsquo;t understand that dry humor shit. I&rsquo;d like the office. I think the office is for straight people</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get it. But the other one is Breaking Bad never got into it</p>
<p>Never gave a fuck Game of Thrones walking dead. Ozark criminal minds Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t give a flying fuck about none of them. There&rsquo;s so many shows</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t get the hype around and I&rsquo;m sure I missed a lot</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t know what shows are out the show you I like the first season the second one</p>
<p>They did too fucking much. The third one haven&rsquo;t watched it. Is there a third one?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but there&rsquo;s certain shows. I&rsquo;ll like give a chance</p>
<p>But it takes a lot to impress me to watch something but with a lot of shows</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t get it. And now I want to talk about movies like any of the superhero movies</p>
<p>Star Wars</p>
<p>Harry Potter what else we got Hallmark movies? Oh fuck. We got to talk about that Hallmark movies are all the same thing</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a little town with one girl and two guys and she got a pick between one of them</p>
<p>What the fuck like we get it girl we get it it&rsquo;s the same fucking shit every time it&rsquo;s the most white-ass shit</p>
<p>Oh, I do like Madea movies</p>
<p>Those are funny, but really any of the Star Wars movies any of like the superhero movies any of the Disney movies?</p>
<p>I never really watched as a kid. Like I saw Finding Nemo</p>
<p>I like Nemo a lot, but I haven&rsquo;t really seen any other movie like all the movies people care about so much</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care scream is a good movie and a good series</p>
<p>I like that like the horror movie scream like one two, three, four and five. I like all of those</p>
<p>I grew up on those but there&rsquo;s so much hype around certain movies. I don&rsquo;t understand like Harry Potter</p>
<p>That one bothers the fuck out of me, why do people like that?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s giving knockoff Wizards of Waverly place, but like Star Wars and shit like that like, huh?</p>
<p>Like be fucking for real BFF are and the superhero movies</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same shit with the same little villain and they always get them</p>
<p>Can we make one where the villain is hot and gay please and he wins?</p>
<p>Can we rewrite the narrative? Can we rewrite it, please?</p>
<p>I just want one that is gay and hot somebody get the fuck on that</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t like anything cookie cutter and the cookie cutter stories and other type of movie</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like is the Avatar shit with the blue people. I don&rsquo;t get it. There&rsquo;s just a lot of movies. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Watch or give a fuck about and now it was just a few if you&rsquo;re thinking of a movie right now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna fuck about it. But one movie I really do like is peppermint because it&rsquo;s fucked up</p>
<p>It shows the reality of like situations and it&rsquo;s not the typical</p>
<p>Ending with the good and the bad guy and I fucking loved it</p>
<p>There is no being the bigger person in that movie and I like that. They killed her daughter</p>
<p>What do you think she&rsquo;s gonna fucking do?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a burn the whole world down and I wouldn&rsquo;t be mad at her but her daughter dies in the first five minutes</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the fucking trailer. Okay, I didn&rsquo;t ruin nothing for you</p>
<p>But peppermint really good movie. I like that a lot</p>
<p>Okay. Now I want to step into style and I y&rsquo;all know a lot of my opinions about style and things people wear</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just gonna bust through these real quick</p>
<p>But a couple I am gonna like elaborate on things. I don&rsquo;t understand the hype about</p>
<p>Silver jewelry, we know we know and white gold too. It looks the fucking same Crocs</p>
<p>Birkenstocks</p>
<p>vans</p>
<p>Jordan ones the shoes that are very popular right now every motherfucker and their mom has</p>
<p>Jordan ones and they be rocking them like did the coolest thing ever and one thing about me</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be that motherfucker. That&rsquo;s like all before the trends</p>
<p>I liked it before you liked it, but I am like back in 2019. I was rocking Jordan ones</p>
<p>I was having trouble finding any in my size because I&rsquo;m size 16 and Jordans. I&rsquo;m size 17 and Yeezys and</p>
<p>Finding shoes in my size was hard, but I found some I was rocking the fuck out of those</p>
<p>I was over them by</p>
<p>2020 really like the end of 2019 like I started wanting it and then at the end of 2019 I was over it</p>
<p>But now in 2022 and 2023, they&rsquo;re fucking booming. Everybody&rsquo;s wearing everybody&rsquo;s got him</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m already over them been over them for a few years and now just seeing them is like</p>
<p>Y&rsquo;all think that&rsquo;s a serve. I know that&rsquo;s judgment. I know that&rsquo;s kind of rude</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just like I don&rsquo;t get the hype behind those like and that also ties into my whole</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand people who like to look like everyone else</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand wanting to fit in and that&rsquo;s partly because I&rsquo;ve never fit in I&rsquo;ve never felt like I had a sense of belonging</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>If I like something that everybody else likes, okay, that&rsquo;s fine. I like it</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a fuck that everybody else likes it</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t like things just because everybody else likes them like I don&rsquo;t dress like everybody</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wear things just because other people wear them like I have my own</p>
<p>Sense of style that makes sense. Like I&rsquo;m very aware. You can&rsquo;t try and clock me on all this shit girl</p>
<p>I already assessed it in myself. Okay. Next is a couple of brands. I want to talk about Louis Vuitton</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dead. It&rsquo;s over with I have a couple things from Louis Vuitton and I&rsquo;m like over it</p>
<p>Like I do have a wallet and I love it, but it&rsquo;s all black</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the epi leather pocket organizer and you can&rsquo;t tell what it is</p>
<p>Like it just has a tiny little logo</p>
<p>But like on the corner and it&rsquo;s just black leather</p>
<p>The monogram shit is so over with like everybody has a fucking Louis Vuitton something. Everybody has a fucking Louis Vuitton bag</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just sick of Louis Vuitton like as a whole</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s very like</p>
<p>Overdone and not in a cute way like a lot of their shit is bad since Virgil came in</p>
<p>He fucked Louis Vuitton up</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t want to get too deep into that because a lot of people don&rsquo;t know like the designer fashion world like I do</p>
<p>But y&rsquo;all do know Michael Kors and I don&rsquo;t like that fucking brand at all. Genuinely. I don&rsquo;t like Michael Kors</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry. There&rsquo;s just something about it. Like I&rsquo;d rather buy coach to Michael Kors</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather buy Kate Spade than Michael Kors like Michael Kors is just a little rat</p>
<p>Like he just fucking steals everybody&rsquo;s ideas like Steve Madden. I like Steve Madden though</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d be having good shit, but like</p>
<p>Michael Kors is just like the little wannabe. I don&rsquo;t know explain it like Michael Kors is just not it</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. Next is Tiffany like the jewelry company</p>
<p>Cartier I get Cartier love bracelets</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever own one because like Michael Kors is over fucking done</p>
<p>I know Cartier love bracelets are like very popular</p>
<p>everybody has them but like</p>
<p>They lost the meaning of what they were supposed to be and people just get them now as like a status symbol like look at</p>
<p>Me look look. I have Cartier. I&rsquo;m important like people that&rsquo;s how people fucking behave now with it and I don&rsquo;t like it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just you know, it&rsquo;s $7,000 when you see it and people harp on that. So like I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not big into the flexi shit, but my whole point with that was saying Tiffany. I don&rsquo;t like Tiffany at all</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t get that hype and then watches that&rsquo;s another thing</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll grow into watches when I get older, but I have a Rolex</p>
<p>I have a couple of nice watches and I don&rsquo;t fucking wear them because I don&rsquo;t like watches</p>
<p>My Rolex was a makeup gift from getting cheated on</p>
<p>Bitch if they fuck you over you best make them shell out some shit</p>
<p>Okay, but I don&rsquo;t wear it haven&rsquo;t worn it in like a year. I genuinely just don&rsquo;t like watches</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a watch person</p>
<p>I was for a minute when I was all big into like</p>
<p>Trying to be flashy and look like oh I have all this designer shit. I&rsquo;ve outgrown that I&rsquo;ll do a podcast episode about like the</p>
<p>Psychology of designer fashion. I still appreciate it a lot. I still love it. But there&rsquo;s a lot of shit</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t touch now and</p>
<p>Watches are just one of those things. I don&rsquo;t understand like</p>
<p>People have they&rsquo;re like status symbols and I look at more of like who is the person wearing it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t look at what watch you have like I was sitting next to this dude on a plane like a couple of months ago</p>
<p>And we were in first class</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re sitting there both minding our fucking business and my brain just wants to have some kind of realization</p>
<p>I look over and I see he has a Rolex on and I&rsquo;m just looking at him and the person he is</p>
<p>not the watch and I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a waste of someone to wear that watch because you absolutely have nothing going the fuck for you</p>
<p>Like he was bad hygiene very out of shape</p>
<p>Low confidence very insecure like the watch doesn&rsquo;t make you look</p>
<p>Cooler it&rsquo;s a sign to people that you have money</p>
<p>Potentially because a lot of people with all this designer shit don&rsquo;t actually have fucking money like you have this status symbol</p>
<p>But if you look past the symbols, who&rsquo;s the motherfucker wearing it?</p>
<p>I assess that now like I don&rsquo;t think people are cool anymore just because they spent two hundred thousand dollars on a watch like</p>
<p>Okay, who&rsquo;s the motherfucker that it&rsquo;s on? You know, I&rsquo;m gonna assess you</p>
<p>I want to see you as a person. What else do you have to contribute?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s great about you not just your wrist game, you know, that one kind of like derailed, but I</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t like watches. I just don&rsquo;t fuck with them. They&rsquo;re not me. I haven&rsquo;t found one. I love I guess that&rsquo;s the problem</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>But I like square faced watches like old vintage II looking ones like Cartier has some but they&rsquo;re still kind of like me like nothing</p>
<p>Speaks to me. I don&rsquo;t have no interest in a watch maybe because I&rsquo;m 24. Maybe I&rsquo;ll grow into it</p>
<p>But yeah watches or something else I just don&rsquo;t get the hype around like it&rsquo;s a status symbol cool, but what else</p>
<p>Okay, my last couple of things are about decor and furniture. I don&rsquo;t like none of the furniture out now</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the style</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ugly like everything out is so ugly and shit quality all of my stuff that I have is from the 70s and 80s</p>
<p>Most of everything that I own my beds from Wayfair because I didn&rsquo;t want to buy a bed</p>
<p>I wanted to just leave my mattress on the floor</p>
<p>But I moved into this bougie ass fucking place and I was like, you can&rsquo;t just have you mattress on the floor</p>
<p>You know what? You need to like get it up. So it&rsquo;s like on a</p>
<p>Frame that&rsquo;s like that big I got to do something because my side tables are two mirrored cubes</p>
<p>So I needed something low enough. I could still go with shut up Leo. What&rsquo;s not the point vintage shit?</p>
<p>I like vintage shit like the style of it like the style of like postmodern 70s and then like the 80s</p>
<p>Furniture was that bitch back then like the quality of it</p>
<p>My fucking dining table is 50 years old 50 50. It&rsquo;s from the 70s. It&rsquo;s so fucking sturdy</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still in great condition you buy a table now</p>
<p>It ain&rsquo;t lasting you three fucking years without looking mad fucked up</p>
<p>like the quality of everything made now is so ass and</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just one part but to the look of it like everything&rsquo;s very generic basic Joe Schmo</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like it. Like nothing is like a vibe. Nothing is cute</p>
<p>It looks like a fucking catalog like everything&rsquo;s the same, you know, or everything&rsquo;s from restoration hardware</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s cool. And it&rsquo;s fucking $40,000 for a couch. Hmm. But yeah, I&rsquo;m just very unimpressed with like</p>
<p>Furniture because our generation has nothing to show for like what the fuck we&rsquo;ve done like you have 70s 80s 90s</p>
<p>2000s you got like the little like what&rsquo;s it called?</p>
<p>Why 2k shit and then after that what decor style is there?</p>
<p>Ikea what the fuck is the style now, you know, like there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>style or trend for</p>
<p>These last couple generations like girl. What the hell are we doing?</p>
<p>What y&rsquo;all got going on cuz whoever&rsquo;s designing all this shit</p>
<p>Oh, like I know you have to buy certain things. Like I can&rsquo;t have all my shit be vintage, but</p>
<p>Certain things are not but most of my big pieces are like my leather couch is vintage in my bedroom</p>
<p>My bed is not my side tables are my big dresser is it&rsquo;s coming. I just ordered it</p>
<p>It was so fucking expensive. That&rsquo;s one bad thing about vintage furniture is it&rsquo;s so goddamn expensive one because I like the cool shit</p>
<p>I like the shit that&rsquo;s like when you see it, but my dining room table my coffee table</p>
<p>All my shit is like vintage to an extent</p>
<p>There are certain things that you have to like just buy cheap like the bed fuck the bed</p>
<p>But you get what I mean?</p>
<p>Like if you can pull in the vibe by having a lot of vintage stuff you can find things here and there that aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just not impressed with none of the furniture nowadays like it&rsquo;s ass</p>
<p>Okay, next thing with like my little category of decor and cars we&rsquo;re gonna get to that is</p>
<p>chevron print</p>
<p>like the little</p>
<p>People that like that what the fuck are you okay? I</p>
<p>Just don&rsquo;t understand that that&rsquo;s it was such a trend before I still see it here and there</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the ugliest shit ever. Like I hate anything Chevron. I like herringbone print</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like these two bracelets here where to go</p>
<p>there it is like these two bracelets are herringbone style, which is like it&rsquo;s not Chevron, but it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>Dumbass would not know the difference but Chevron. I just don&rsquo;t like it and I&rsquo;m gonna leave it there next is silk pillowcases</p>
<p>Everybody be going on about their silk pillowcases. Oh my god. I love them. They help from an acne motherfucker</p>
<p>Just get a regular pillowcase and wash it flip it over, you know, but silk pillowcases be sliding everywhere</p>
<p>How do y&rsquo;all stay propped up on them? I be hoop sliding right the fuck off. I don&rsquo;t like silk pillowcases</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get the hype behind them people love them. I hate them. They&rsquo;re so inconvenient</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just not they&rsquo;re pretty sure. I&rsquo;ll give you that if you get black ones, that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>Maybe like a white but you bitches wear makeup. You can&rsquo;t have white ones, but silk pillowcases just be flying everywhere</p>
<p>They just slide all over the fucking place. I don&rsquo;t like it. I don&rsquo;t get the hype</p>
<p>All right</p>
<p>last thing</p>
<p>loud</p>
<p>cars</p>
<p>That shit gripes my ass, oh my god, like not loud cars where it&rsquo;s like, oh, okay</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s just built loud</p>
<p>Motherfuckers that do mods to it like cut the exhaust and do shit to make it loud</p>
<p>Why you obnoxious bitch and I am very jaded about that because I do have a past that</p>
<p>Made me very paranoid. So anytime I hear a sudden loud noise</p>
<p>I like jump or like flinch or like I&rsquo;m like on guard and my fight-or-flight kicks on so it&rsquo;s like every time I hear some</p>
<p>Obnoxiously loud fucking shit, like all you driving your little car is 20 miles an hour</p>
<p>Which I don&rsquo;t get your little fucking rice rockets why it&rsquo;s so loud and you don&rsquo;t drive it fast</p>
<p>Oh that pisses me off</p>
<p>This is not a pet peeve video, but y&rsquo;all like that shit and I don&rsquo;t that&rsquo;s what this video is about</p>
<p>If you got a loud car drive the motherfucker so fast. I only hear it for two seconds</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just very jumpy. So y&rsquo;all enjoy your little cars. Just don&rsquo;t fucking do it near me if they&rsquo;re loud and obnoxious</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Genuinely, why like that just gives me the vibe of like look at me. Look at me like</p>
<p>Look at me. Look at me like</p>
<p>Girl, and typically they&rsquo;re a colored car</p>
<p>Can you not just have a normal ass car or like be able to turn on the loud and turn it off?</p>
<p>Cuz what the fuck like do you want that bitch like screeching and like roaring every time you start it</p>
<p>I know when you wake up at 6 30 in the morning to go to work</p>
<p>You just fucking sit in that bitch like like what is it necessary?</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not as cool as you think it is and</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m just a little triggered because I&rsquo;m like jumpy and I don&rsquo;t like that shit</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t get the hype behind it. If the car is not over a hundred and twenty thousand dollars</p>
<p>It should be quiet as fuck. I shouldn&rsquo;t hear it like a Tesla Tesla sound like little bees</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so fucking funny</p>
<p>But one thing to know about Tesla&rsquo;s if you pull out in front of one of them it emergency brakes itself</p>
<p>So you can pull out and cut off Tesla&rsquo;s and they&rsquo;ll stop theirself</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t be scared to pull out in front of one, but if you get in a wreck, you didn&rsquo;t hear from me</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I love when Tesla&rsquo;s are like in traffic cuz I&rsquo;m like, oh free slot. I just</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s all the yelling and bitching I&rsquo;m gonna do for this episode</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed this my little hot take on things that people love that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t if you agreed with some things leave me a comment and tell me which ones cuz I&rsquo;d like to know and if you</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t agree</p>
<p>Be nice</p>
<p>If you want to follow me on tik-tok and Instagram and keep up with me all my social medias</p>
<p>The link is in the description</p>
<p>You could download my app positive focus and get positive notifications all day link for that&rsquo;s in the description</p>
<p>The link for everything you need will be down below and the clothing will be coming out and like two weeks ish</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still deciding on a date, but I did make a Instagram account for the clothing brand. It&rsquo;s called Leo Skeppy collection</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll have the link in the description and I&rsquo;ll be posting on there and everywhere else that I am when the clothing goes live</p>
<p>But get excited cuz it&rsquo;s so fucking cool. Like oh my god</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the shit that I wish everybody else would make but they don&rsquo;t they don&rsquo;t have the balls</p>
<p>So this is one design trust</p>
<p>No one right very me very weak if you get it</p>
<p>And then I have one that says not above violence</p>
<p>And then I have some that say aware and aggravated and then on the aware and aggravated one</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s old English font with white and then right here in white. It says trust. No one like my tattoo</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m so excited to release all of that</p>
