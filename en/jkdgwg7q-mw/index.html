be hard to believe but certain people once they start carbs they cannot stop so recently i had a person who reached out and wanted some help because they were slightly addicted to carbs they wanted to start keto but they had this addiction how do they go about it so i decided to create a video for this person all right we&amp;rsquo;ve been trained since birth to consume sugar okay it&amp;rsquo;s in baby food it&amp;rsquo;s in all of our foods and uh you know go trick-or-treating and you get all this candy and every holiday and cookies etc etc and what happens inside our body every time we do this is we start to develop um an addiction um and that involves two neurotransmitters one is dopamine which is involved with pleasure sensation and then we have serotonin which is involved with the happiness sensation now i used to have an addiction i mean a periodic craving for ben and jerry&amp;rsquo;s ice cream i got caught up in this uh eating a pint every night before i went to bed type situation over i would say a year i would be obsessed about it i would be thinking about it all day long and eventually if i didn&amp;rsquo;t consume it i had this pressure or stress build up that may be physically uncomfortable but as soon as i started consuming this delicious ice cream i felt satisfied happy i felt like i was surviving i could finally breathe again for about about a minute now of course this was artificially making me satisfied happy and feeling like i was surviving when i actually was feeling very miserable the rest of the day and not really surviving health-wise so what you have to realize is that every time you give in to this craving you&amp;rsquo;re going to get more cravings over time it&amp;rsquo;s going to happen it&amp;rsquo;s going to become stronger and stronger over time and it&amp;rsquo;s very interesting to me that your body can get into a state physically where it demands this sugar this addiction is real and it will literally control you to a point where you&amp;rsquo;re completely out of control so what can you do at this point number one you need to stop eating completely you need to start fasting immediately because what&amp;rsquo;s gonna happen instead of eating food you&amp;rsquo;re gonna eat no food and your body is gonna have to switch over there&amp;rsquo;s gonna be a little uncomfortable transition period but it won&amp;rsquo;t be too bad or your body will start to switch to ketosis and then when you start burning fat for fuel your brain actually starts to heal and reset because the receptors for these neurotransmitters are so messed up they need to be reset the absolute best way to do it is simply start fasting i would recommend minimally 24 hours to 48 hours and if you can actually do exercise light exercise walking that would be even better because you can burn off that sugar that you just consumed so just get it out of the system get your body into ketosis and then your brain will feel better the interesting thing about the brain is that if given the choice the brain will prefer ketones over sugar any day it&amp;rsquo;s very therapeutic and as soon as that happens you start to shift to be more in control over this addiction all right number three you have to be very careful to avoid the triggers get all the junk food out of the house including those chips that you have up in the cupboard that you&amp;rsquo;ve been hiding make it difficult for you to get this junk food especially late at night when you&amp;rsquo;re kind of bored so many people at night they&amp;rsquo;re not even hungry they&amp;rsquo;re just going through the cupboards looking for something they don&amp;rsquo;t even know what they&amp;rsquo;re looking for but maybe something salty and crunchy maybe something sweet but you need to get the junk out of your house very important when you&amp;rsquo;re fasting don&amp;rsquo;t read cookbooks okay especially for desserts you want to avoid any type of trigger including pictures of recipes or desserts because dopamine is all about anticipating pleasure as soon as you eat this food you don&amp;rsquo;t continue to increase dopamine dopamine is kind of a precursor to actual eating it so as soon as you look at a picture or smell food you instantly start increasing the dopamine and that is going to create a controlling factor over your body let&amp;rsquo;s say for example you&amp;rsquo;re driving your bike down your neighborhood and it&amp;rsquo;s dinner time and you can smell spaghetti cooking in the from someone&amp;rsquo;s house that would be bad don&amp;rsquo;t do that so smells are very powerful kentucky fried chicken they pump out all these different smells so they can lure you into that facility avoid any and all environments that can tempt you and lastly b vitamins are are crucial vitamin b1 will completely handle this right here okay so use that through nutritional yeast to help curb your addictions i&amp;rsquo;m sorry your cravings hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it&amp;rsquo;s a free course i want you to take it and here&amp;rsquo;s why here&amp;rsquo;s you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right

certain people once they start carbs they cannot  </p><p>stop so recently i had a person who reached 
out and wanted some help because they were  </p><p>slightly addicted to carbs they wanted to start 
keto but they had this addiction how do they  </p><p>go about it so i decided to create a video 
for this person all right we&rsquo;ve been trained  </p><p>since birth to consume sugar okay it&rsquo;s in baby 
food it&rsquo;s in all of our foods and uh you know go  </p><p>trick-or-treating and you get all this candy and 
every holiday and cookies etc etc and what happens  </p><p>inside our body every time we do this is we start 
to develop um an addiction um and that involves  </p><p>two neurotransmitters one is dopamine which is 
involved with pleasure sensation and then we have  </p><p>serotonin which is involved with the happiness 
sensation now i used to have an addiction i mean a  </p><p>periodic craving for ben and jerry&rsquo;s ice 
cream i got caught up in this uh eating a pint  </p><p>every night before i went to bed type situation 
over i would say a year i would be obsessed about  </p><p>it i would be thinking about it all day long 
and eventually if i didn&rsquo;t consume it i had this  </p><p>pressure or stress build up that may be physically 
uncomfortable but as soon as i started consuming  </p><p>this delicious ice cream i felt satisfied happy i 
felt like i was surviving i could finally breathe  </p><p>again for about about a minute now of course this 
was artificially making me satisfied happy and  </p><p>feeling like i was surviving when i actually 
was feeling very miserable the rest of the day  </p><p>and not really surviving health-wise so what you 
have to realize is that every time you give in to  </p><p>this craving you&rsquo;re going to get more cravings 
over time it&rsquo;s going to happen it&rsquo;s going to  </p><p>become stronger and stronger over time and it&rsquo;s 
very interesting to me that your body can get into  </p><p>a state physically where it demands this sugar 
this addiction is real and it will literally  </p><p>control you to a point where you&rsquo;re completely 
out of control so what can you do at this point  </p><p>number one you need to stop eating completely you 
need to start fasting immediately because what&rsquo;s  </p><p>gonna happen instead of eating food you&rsquo;re gonna 
eat no food and your body is gonna have to switch  </p><p>over there&rsquo;s gonna be a little uncomfortable 
transition period but it won&rsquo;t be too bad or your  </p><p>body will start to switch to ketosis and then when 
you start burning fat for fuel your brain actually  </p><p>starts to heal and reset because the receptors 
for these neurotransmitters are so messed up they  </p><p>need to be reset the absolute best way to do it is 
simply start fasting i would recommend minimally  </p><p>24 hours to 48 hours and if you can actually do 
exercise light exercise walking that would be even  </p><p>better because you can burn off that sugar that 
you just consumed so just get it out of the system  </p><p>get your body into ketosis and then your brain 
will feel better the interesting thing about  </p><p>the brain is that if given the choice the 
brain will prefer ketones over sugar any  </p><p>day it&rsquo;s very therapeutic and as soon as that 
happens you start to shift to be more in control  </p><p>over this addiction all right number three you 
have to be very careful to avoid the triggers  </p><p>get all the junk food out of the house including 
those chips that you have up in the cupboard that  </p><p>you&rsquo;ve been hiding make it difficult for you to 
get this junk food especially late at night when  </p><p>you&rsquo;re kind of bored so many people at night 
they&rsquo;re not even hungry they&rsquo;re just going  </p><p>through the cupboards looking for something they 
don&rsquo;t even know what they&rsquo;re looking for but maybe  </p><p>something salty and crunchy maybe something sweet 
but you need to get the junk out of your house  </p><p>very important when you&rsquo;re fasting don&rsquo;t 
read cookbooks okay especially for desserts  </p><p>you want to avoid any type of trigger 
including pictures of recipes or desserts  </p><p>because dopamine is all about anticipating 
pleasure as soon as you eat this food  </p><p>you don&rsquo;t continue to increase dopamine dopamine 
is kind of a precursor to actual eating it so  </p><p>as soon as you look at a picture or smell food 
you instantly start increasing the dopamine and  </p><p>that is going to create a controlling factor over 
your body let&rsquo;s say for example you&rsquo;re driving  </p><p>your bike down your neighborhood and it&rsquo;s dinner 
time and you can smell spaghetti cooking in the  </p><p>from someone&rsquo;s house that would be bad don&rsquo;t 
do that so smells are very powerful kentucky  </p><p>fried chicken they pump out all these different 
smells so they can lure you into that facility  </p><p>avoid any and all environments that can tempt you 
and lastly b vitamins are are crucial vitamin b1  </p><p>will completely handle this right here okay so use 
that through nutritional yeast to help curb your  </p><p>addictions i&rsquo;m sorry your cravings hey before 
you go real quick i have a course entitled how  </p><p>to bulletproof your immune system it&rsquo;s a free 
course i want you to take it and here&rsquo;s why  </p><p>here&rsquo;s you here is your environment everyone 
is focused on this over here avoiding  </p><p>your environment but what about here what about 
strengthening your immune system that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s  </p><p>missing this course will show you how to 
bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate  </p><p>and resist your environment much better by 
strengthening your own immune system i put  </p><p>a link down in the description right down
