    <p>It&rsquo;s Hardcore History.</p>
<p>Attentum.</p>
<p>Which military was superior?</p>
<p>The First World War military of the German Imperial State or the Second World War military</p>
<p>of Nazi Germany?</p>
<p>I know that sounds like a random question, but it&rsquo;s actually something that I get asked</p>
<p>about all the time.</p>
<p>All the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not so random either because these people are not just asking me that question out of</p>
<p>thin air.</p>
<p>They are asking me to elaborate on a statement that I once made, kind of a throwaway line</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m remembering it correctly, where I had pointed out that I thought that the First</p>
<p>World War German military, and when we say that we mean the entire defense apparatus,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>The entire structure, not the Army per se, not the Navy per se, but all of it put together</p>
<p>with the industry, the grand strategy, the, you know, states and armies are intertwined</p>
<p>in ways that are key.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s understand that.</p>
<p>But when we compare, or when I do compare the two, I was comparing the entire structure</p>
<p>against the entire structure.</p>
<p>First World War Germany&rsquo;s military against Second World War Germany&rsquo;s military.</p>
<p>Now what I was not prepared for was the fact that this would be so surprising to so many</p>
<p>people and interesting to them, to be honest.</p>
<p>I mean, like I said, I&rsquo;ve, I&rsquo;ve been asked to elaborate on that question many times and</p>
<p>no one is argumentative, by the way, or upset.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re interested.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re curious.</p>
<p>And it took me a while to realize why, but I think I&rsquo;ve figured out that it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s counterintuitive.</p>
<p>Most people out there who are not World War II buffs just assume, because my goodness,</p>
<p>who hasn&rsquo;t heard, seen hours of black and white footage or what have you, you know,</p>
<p>all the stuff that Nazi Germany was working on from ballistic missiles to panzer divisions</p>
<p>to jet aircraft.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, there&rsquo;s Nazi scientists are such great fodder even today that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why you have them in all the comic books and the Red Skull and the Captain American.</p>
<p>I mean, Odessa, the boys from Brazil, I mean, it goes on and on.</p>
<p>This Nazi science thing is fascinating.</p>
<p>And so, so mid, you know, it&rsquo;s not steampunk because it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s whatever the mid 20th century version of steampunk is.</p>
<p>First World War Germany really is steampunk.</p>
<p>I guess what I&rsquo;m trying to say is I think there&rsquo;s been a lot of hype for Second World</p>
<p>War Germany.</p>
<p>The First World War Germany doesn&rsquo;t get, and that&rsquo;s what makes it compelling to hear a</p>
<p>different opinion to some people.</p>
<p>Now, why the heck am I talking about this now and what, what are we even doing here?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth a little explanation since this is the first new podcast we started in more</p>
<p>than a decade.</p>
<p>And really the first thing we were going to do is just throw all this on the history</p>
<p>feed, figuring that it&rsquo;s history, but you people have taught me a valuable lesson over</p>
<p>time and that&rsquo;s that you don&rsquo;t want anything that isn&rsquo;t what you&rsquo;re expecting on that feed.</p>
<p>You may be okay with me interviewing people, but you don&rsquo;t want it on your hardcore history</p>
<p>feed when you think you&rsquo;re getting a hardcore history episode downloaded and it turns out</p>
<p>to be an interview.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve learned you want something very specific on the hardcore history proper feed.</p>
<p>The problem for us, of course, and maybe you too, is that we&rsquo;re averaging about 2.5</p>
<p>new shows a year on that feed, which is a long time to be out of touch with your audience.</p>
<p>So for a very long time, we have been looking for some sort of content, I guess you could</p>
<p>call short form content.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m obviously a long form guy, takes me 20 minutes to clear my throat, as you all know.</p>
<p>Originally a long time ago, the idea of blitz additions, which was supposed to mean short,</p>
<p>but now it just means a completely different kind of focus on the show.</p>
<p>That was supposed to fill this gap, didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>We are cutting back and that might be an optimistic way of even putting it on the common sense</p>
<p>stuff right now.</p>
<p>So how do you better use the time that that would free up?</p>
<p>Well, how about touching base with the hardcore history audience more than 2.5 times a year?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re trying to do here.</p>
<p>And just so you know, I couldn&rsquo;t decide on a format because I liked all of them to a</p>
<p>degree, but I didn&rsquo;t want to get locked into anything.</p>
<p>I mean, I like interviews, but I don&rsquo;t want to have to do them all the time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to do an interview show per se.</p>
<p>I like doing, you know, short little history things if I can manage to do anything short</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t turn into a hardcore history show, but I don&rsquo;t want to be responsible for doing</p>
<p>that every time.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>The last thing we want to do is do a new show that takes away from the old show that already</p>
<p>takes too long to do.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So we understand the parameters with which we&rsquo;re working here.</p>
<p>Led Zeppelin once said that their format for their music was tight, but loose.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way I like to operate too.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have a format where, you know, it&rsquo;s our stuff, right?</p>
<p>We are recognizably us, but what you&rsquo;re going to get, that&rsquo;s anybody&rsquo;s guess.</p>
<p>This is for lack of a better word, and I still don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re going to call this.</p>
<p>This is the hardcore history overflow feed.</p>
<p>This is everything we&rsquo;re not putting in the regular feed, whether it&rsquo;s interviews with</p>
<p>historians, biographers, or maybe historical participants from time to time.</p>
<p>Love to do some primary source work where we could record somebody&rsquo;s memories in digital</p>
<p>stone, and then maybe somewhere down the line a historian can mine that for useful info</p>
<p>someday.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be great to contribute to the storehouse of personal experiences and knowledge.</p>
<p>I do have weird things I&rsquo;d like to throw out there sometimes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to have a recurring segment that I call the worst place to be in the world.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s self-explanatory, but I have a bunch of little things like that.</p>
<p>Nothing that I think you could base a whole podcast series on forever, but enough so maybe</p>
<p>we can throw some stuff out there.</p>
<p>You know, we couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to make it anything but meh to you when you&rsquo;re expecting</p>
<p>five hours of hardcore history depth, and you get 20 minutes of scampering over the</p>
<p>thin ice.</p>
<p>I mean, is there anything we could do in 20 minutes where you would go, yeah, that was</p>
<p>great, when you&rsquo;re expecting five hours?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but we feel like, if nothing else, I would love to say hi to you more often,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what this is.</p>
<p>So the reason we&rsquo;re talking about the two World War militaries of Germany and comparing</p>
<p>them is because after the thousandth person asked me recently to elaborate on that question,</p>
<p>I was walking away from the discussion, and a person who may or may not be real who was</p>
<p>with me turned to me and said, why don&rsquo;t you make that a podcast?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you just do a whole show on answering that question?</p>
<p>Which military was better, First or Second World War Germany?</p>
<p>He goes, you get asked about it enough, there&rsquo;s obviously an interest out there.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t that just be a show?</p>
<p>Answer that question, 20 minutes, 25 minutes, whatever it is, boom, throw an ad on the end.</p>
<p>Done, right?</p>
<p>Said hi to the audience and everything.</p>
<p>Think if we could get one of those out a month, wouldn&rsquo;t that fill in the gap a little bit</p>
<p>between epic hardcore history shows?</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s going to provide anything of interest.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re experimenting here a little bit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to answer that question if I can.</p>
<p>And maybe this will be one of the recurring segments where I essentially stand up amongst</p>
<p>all of you and I make my case.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying I&rsquo;m right.</p>
<p>I certainly am coming at this from an angle of this is my opinion, but let me throw out</p>
<p>my viewpoint and then you can talk amongst yourselves and decide whether you give it</p>
<p>any validity or not.</p>
<p>And of course, me being me, I had planned to come in here and just do it off the cuff</p>
<p>so it didn&rsquo;t take any hardcore history recording time, but I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So I had to pull out the books, look up some stuff.</p>
<p>I figured who wants to just hear my opinion?</p>
<p>You got to have a few supports, Carlin.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t walk in there and just, you know, you got to, if you&rsquo;re going to be a lawyer,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to cite some things.</p>
<p>So I have a few things to cite.</p>
<p>Obviously this whole question is a bit silly and war gamey, if you will, but I like my</p>
<p>silly war gamey questions to be as scientific, hardheaded, realistic, and logical as possible.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s lay out some parameters.</p>
<p>The first thing we have to point out is we are not talking about these two armies fighting</p>
<p>each other.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>We all understand how silly that would be.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t always silly.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve always found that interesting up until a certain point in history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not wild to imagine armies that existed, you know, in very different time periods successfully</p>
<p>fighting one another.</p>
<p>If you said Alexander the Great&rsquo;s army is going to take on Julius Caesar&rsquo;s Romans, which</p>
<p>were about 250 years later.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t automatically say Alexander&rsquo;s doomed.</p>
<p>You bet your money on Caesar and the Romans.</p>
<p>But if you said Alexander had a 25% chance of winning, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s 250 years difference in time.</p>
<p>By about, what would you say, the mid-19th century somewhere?</p>
<p>That all changes when the pace of change speeds up.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, if you&rsquo;re a great power and you find your battlefield technology 30,</p>
<p>35 years out of date, you&rsquo;re in big trouble.</p>
<p>And by the 20th century, you can see this pace of change acceleration going so fast</p>
<p>that the innovations that occur inside of a war can win or lose you the war.</p>
<p>I think you most clearly see this for the first time in the air war, in the First World</p>
<p>War, where if you get a leap in terms of a technological innovation for airplanes ahead</p>
<p>of the other side, and you get your planes in the air, it could be six months of owning</p>
<p>the sky before the other side catches up.</p>
<p>And in certain circumstances, that could cost you the war.</p>
<p>So this technological race is getting so fast, we end up certainly by the early 20th century</p>
<p>with a dynamic that we see all the time now and that we&rsquo;re very comfortable with, the</p>
<p>idea of innovations happening all the time during the war.</p>
<p>In the Second World War, all you Second World War buffs, I mean, how often do you think</p>
<p>of which particular variant of this particular plane?</p>
<p>Is this an ME-109E or G?</p>
<p>Because it makes a huge difference, right?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because this race of change will literally win you or lose you the war by about the First</p>
<p>or Second World War.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not comparing these two armies against each other, because even the 1918 version</p>
<p>of the German army, which is really an alpha or a beta version of the Wehrmacht, and yet</p>
<p>it ain&rsquo;t facing the Wehrmacht successfully at all, and it&rsquo;s only a 20-year difference</p>
<p>between the two.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not pitting them against each other.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re pitting them on a curve based on their historical enemies.</p>
<p>And that point I made a second ago I think is very relevant.</p>
<p>Only 20 years between each other.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re 20 years old, that seems like a long time, but when you get to 50, like</p>
<p>I am, 51, 20 years looks short.</p>
<p>As one historian said, 20 years is not peace, it&rsquo;s an intermission.</p>
<p>I had an Air Force colonel I grew up next door to, he always said it was the equivalent</p>
<p>of reloading.</p>
<p>It always boggles the mind a little bit to realize how quickly the Germans were moving</p>
<p>to get around the treaty restrictions.</p>
<p>I mean, some historians have pushed it all the way back to like 1919, which if true would</p>
<p>mean that the seeds of rearmament were already being sown as the agreement to end the First</p>
<p>World War was being concluded.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s wild.</p>
<p>You all know that there were things going on in the Soviet Union where they had hidden</p>
<p>deals to develop weapons systems and tactics and factories and all that stuff on Russian</p>
<p>soil hidden from the prying eyes of the people who would enforce these treaties.</p>
<p>The German attitude would probably be that the treaties were forced upon Germany under</p>
<p>false pretenses.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of criticism you can make against those Versailles Treaty restrictions.</p>
<p>In fact, the allies, you know, before Hitler came to power, there were lots of negotiations</p>
<p>about cutting slack on some of this stuff later.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the point is, is that long before Hitler was in anybody&rsquo;s rear view mirror,</p>
<p>even in the Weimar Republic&rsquo;s early days, you know, you already had an attempt to rearm</p>
<p>Germany or set the groundwork, lay the groundwork for rearmament.</p>
<p>And it provides an interesting what if scenario to wonder if Hitler had never come to power,</p>
<p>how much of his early agenda happens under any German government.</p>
<p>I mean, in my mind, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine any German government not eventually re-militarizing</p>
<p>the Rhineland, you know, even if you&rsquo;re a Weimar Republic democratic one.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting to wonder about the early stuff that Hitler did and whether a Weimar</p>
<p>Republic might have done it too.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also intriguing to note, you know, that long before Hitler, the foundation was</p>
<p>being laid for the rebuilding of the German military.</p>
<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know, the German military at the end of the First World War was essentially</p>
<p>torn apart.</p>
<p>An army that had numbered in the several millions at one point in the field was reduced to 100,000</p>
<p>men.</p>
<p>One person at the time called them a police force.</p>
<p>Paramilitary is the way they&rsquo;re somehow described now, which basically means something between</p>
<p>a police force and a soldier, 100,000 men.</p>
<p>Their neighbors all had many more.</p>
<p>All kinds of weapon systems are prohibited.</p>
<p>The reason all this stuff matters is because in this short period of time between the two</p>
<p>world wars, the Germans have to recreate an army from scratch and they can&rsquo;t even really</p>
<p>get going until the middle 1930s.</p>
<p>So how deep do the roots of this thing go?</p>
<p>Even if you attach it to the earlier military traditions, when you compare it to the First</p>
<p>World War German state, which has these deep old roots and they can trace it to before</p>
<p>Germany was a state with the histories of several different individual German states</p>
<p>like Prussia and Bavaria and all these places.</p>
<p>The First World War German state is one, is like a bodybuilder who&rsquo;s been eating right</p>
<p>and building themselves up slowly but surely.</p>
<p>The one in the Second World War is somebody who had to go heavily into steroids because</p>
<p>of a terrible injury.</p>
<p>And they come into the war looking pumped up and initially doing good.</p>
<p>But when, you know, something that was supposed to be an easy knockout turns into a slugfest,</p>
<p>you have the legs to weather the storm into the later rounds.</p>
<p>You know, I can&rsquo;t help but use the boxing analogies, can I?</p>
<p>And in that sense, you&rsquo;d have to say that both of these armies, the First and Second</p>
<p>World War German armies, are big punchers, knockout artists.</p>
<p>But the Second World War one is like Mike Tyson, malevolent, intimidating, awesome,</p>
<p>throws these knockout blows, knocks out people spectacularly, can&rsquo;t take your eyes off him,</p>
<p>but foundationally weak, maybe, psyche, stamina, all those things.</p>
<p>First World War Germany, a little bit more controlled, although they&rsquo;re a big gambling</p>
<p>army too, they remind me a lot more of a boxer like Joe Louis, the heavyweight champion</p>
<p>of the world in the 1930s, 1940s, and into the 1950s.</p>
<p>Louis was a fantastic puncher too, a killer, but a little bit more defensive, more careful,</p>
<p>plodding was the way Muhammad Ali described him, but that&rsquo;s a little unfair.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re not as wild as the Second World War Tyson-esque one.</p>
<p>They too can knock out opponents, and they do with regularity in the First World War.</p>
<p>But the difference is, is that their foundation is much more solid.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re much more stable, and they can take you into the later rounds and knock you out.</p>
<p>Remember, the Second World War was essentially over in terms of knowing the outcome by about</p>
<p>mid-1943.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s two years before the war against Germany ended, but everyone knew the Germans weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>winning anything two years earlier.</p>
<p>So Tyson is defeated, it just is uncertain which round he will actually be knocked out</p>
<p>in, whereas in the First World War, you know, the Joe Louis First World War German military</p>
<p>is still throwing potential knockout blows in the last year of the war.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what value I put on this, but let&rsquo;s note that the German army that went</p>
<p>to war in 1914 is an undefeated force.</p>
<p>And going back almost to Napoleon, they trace an almost unbroken string of victories, whereas</p>
<p>the army in the Second World War is literally and figuratively the child of defeat.</p>
<p>The rank-and-file soldiers likely to have had a father who fought, maybe died, maybe</p>
<p>grievously wounded in the First World War, the upper echelons of the officer corps, almost</p>
<p>to a man, First World War veterans, and of course, the totalitarian leader at the apex</p>
<p>of the leadership pyramid, Hitler himself, was a corporal in the trenches.</p>
<p>How much did that defeat and seeing what they saw in that war change them?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that you could ever put a number on it.</p>
<p>I would just say if you have two boxing champions facing each other and one is undefeated and</p>
<p>the other isn&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s something that helps the undefeated fighter.</p>
<p>It may be different person to person, and I couldn&rsquo;t tell you how much and in what way,</p>
<p>but everyone notices it and acknowledges it.</p>
<p>I would say the same is true here.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s hard to make a case if I&rsquo;m standing up here as a lawyer representing this point</p>
<p>of view.</p>
<p>So let me represent it in a way that maybe I can pull some evidence together and convince</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the armies themselves, as opposed to the navies, the air forces, and</p>
<p>the rest.</p>
<p>Both these armies were very similar to each other, so you have to kind of compare the</p>
<p>things that are different about them.</p>
<p>Both of these armies have at their core the magnificent German fighting soldier at the</p>
<p>squad level, trying to figure out what makes them as good as they are.</p>
<p>Very hard to measure.</p>
<p>I remember Neil Ferguson in his book, A Pity of War, tries to break it down to some sort</p>
<p>of chart.</p>
<p>You know, how much more deadly are the German soldiers than, you know, soldiery of other</p>
<p>countries?</p>
<p>But remember, it&rsquo;s a lot of things working together, and a lot of things that the German</p>
<p>military have been good at for a long time, discipline, drill, obedience, tactical efficiency,</p>
<p>coordination between various arms, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>The same adjectives that are used about the German soldiery in both world wars are adjectives</p>
<p>that are used to describe Frederick the Great&rsquo;s mid-18th century Prussian troops.</p>
<p>And the German military tradition of both world wars is one that can be traced back</p>
<p>easily to Frederick the Great&rsquo;s Prussia.</p>
<p>Some people like to go a lot earlier than that, but it&rsquo;s easy to look at the military</p>
<p>traditions of 18th century Prussia and see those infused into 20th century German armies.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re comparable at the soldier level.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re also comparable in terms of their tactical equipment.</p>
<p>I mean, you look at like, okay, what were their rifles like?</p>
<p>What were the machine gun?</p>
<p>All this stuff is predictably very good in the German army.</p>
<p>The artillery was good.</p>
<p>All these things are pretty much the same.</p>
<p>So when you try to figure out what would make one less strong than the other, you look at</p>
<p>the underpinnings.</p>
<p>And in this case, I try to imagine the German army in the Second World War without Nazis.</p>
<p>If you take the Nazis out of the Second World War German army, it instantly gets better.</p>
<p>Then I think you could compare the two.</p>
<p>I still think I&rsquo;d go First World War better because of the underpinnings of the state</p>
<p>being much more old and strong, like a well-constructed building.</p>
<p>You know, whatever happens, the Second World War German military is a rickety, hastily</p>
<p>thrown up structure if you&rsquo;re talking about the economy that supports it.</p>
<p>Every World War II buff knows that the people who were trying to build up the stockpile</p>
<p>of weaponry and whatnot did not want to go to war as early as 1939.</p>
<p>Adam Tooze points out the economic realities that made Hitler decide not to wait until</p>
<p>the equipment and all that was ready.</p>
<p>So the good reasoning on both sides, believe it or not.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m going to hang my hat on the idea that the fact that the Second World War German</p>
<p>military is infested and run by Nazis is what makes it inferior to the First World</p>
<p>War military.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start with why this would matter at all.</p>
<p>And the basic answer that covers most of these bases is that the ideological question now</p>
<p>becomes at least as important, and I think you can easily make the argument more important</p>
<p>than the question of merit or technical expertise.</p>
<p>Merit&rsquo;s ideology becomes more important than merit.</p>
<p>And once the Nazis begin to, you know, place people in positions all up and down the leadership</p>
<p>tree from top to bottom, just like Stalin did in his system, then you begin to see the</p>
<p>impact of people that are less competent on the system.</p>
<p>People that never would have gotten jobs in First World War Germany because there would</p>
<p>have been people much better than they to occupy those positions are getting work in</p>
<p>Second World War Germany.</p>
<p>And it degrades everything.</p>
<p>In fact, let&rsquo;s look at the guy.</p>
<p>To me, this is the person who proves the rule.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just maybe the highest ranking incompetent official, unless, of course, you include Hitler</p>
<p>himself.</p>
<p>There are still, by the way, those people who consider Hitler some sort of military</p>
<p>genius.</p>
<p>I would make the case, and maybe this is a question for another show, that if you had</p>
<p>Hitler transported back to the deliberations of the First World War German general staff,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s only 20 people that can fit in the room they&rsquo;re having this discussion in,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re only going to let the 20 best strategists in the room, I don&rsquo;t think Hitler</p>
<p>gets anywhere near the front of the line to even get in the room.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s not talk about him.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about his second in command, a guy who is&hellip;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in charge of maybe you could say the most disappointing, underperforming wing of</p>
<p>the German military, and the one that probably was most responsible for a lot of the problems</p>
<p>because they put a lot of weight and a lot of resources into the German Air Force.</p>
<p>And then they handed those resources, that responsibility, and the weight of the war</p>
<p>in so many areas, and put it on the shoulders of Hermann Goering, a guy who was so incompetent</p>
<p>his job at one point, that if you were sending out commandos from the Allied side, hit teams</p>
<p>to take out German leadership, you would specifically want to make sure you did not shoot Hermann</p>
<p>Goering, because he&rsquo;s one of the best things that ever happened to the Allied war effort,</p>
<p>because he was incompetent, and he would not have had that job in the First World War system.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s understand something.</p>
<p>The First World War system had its own problem with nepotism.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not forgiving them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re part of that tradition of blue-blooded aristocracy, right?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll look at the nominal commanders of a lot of the First World War armies on</p>
<p>the German side, and they&rsquo;re prince this, and crown prince that.</p>
<p>And some of those guys were decent generals, by the way.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ll notice that for the ones who weren&rsquo;t, the German military was extremely adept at</p>
<p>walling off their ability to negatively impact things too much, and the best example of that,</p>
<p>of course, at all, is how the military dictatorship of Germany were able to sort of isolate and</p>
<p>quarantine the Kaiser himself, the imperial warlord of Germany, you know, sit in the corner,</p>
<p>play with your maps and your ships, we have a war to conduct, and they did.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s going to do that in the Second World War?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s going to cordon off Hitler and quarantine Hitler from his bad decisions being transmitted</p>
<p>to the military?</p>
<p>Nobody.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very ideological state, and the ideology plays as larger role or a larger role in everything.</p>
<p>And ideology, by the way, is absolutely key for understanding the Second World War at all.</p>
<p>Adam Tooze, the wonderful economic historian, makes these wonderful points in his book,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll have to quote a little bit of it, but he points out essentially, and it occurred</p>
<p>to me when I read the lines, I&rsquo;m like, oh, this is wild.</p>
<p>Basically, my words put into his mouth, you know, the question is, what would happen if</p>
<p>a major nation state got taken over by a leader who was a fanatical conspiracy theorist</p>
<p>and saw the world strictly through their conspiracy lens and then acted upon, you know, what they</p>
<p>thought they saw?</p>
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s imagine that the person running a major nation state believes that</p>
<p>aliens from outer space have been controlling nations and world leaders for 100 years, and</p>
<p>when they get into power, they start acting, you know, as if that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really going</p>
<p>on, right?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t base our decisions on what these countries say.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re puppets for the aliens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kooky, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>But you know, Tooze reminded me of something we all know, but we tend to forget, especially</p>
<p>we war gamers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll sit down there and we&rsquo;re thinking about this tank and that gun, and you forget the</p>
<p>ideology that&rsquo;s pushing these armies forward to begin with.</p>
<p>Hitler is a fanatical conspiracy theorist, but he&rsquo;s not thinking of space aliens, he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>thinking of Jews running the world.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a tendency to think, yes, yes, yes, but, you know, these other things matter</p>
<p>until you realize that, and this is what Tooze was so good at in his 2006 work, The Wages</p>
<p>of Destruction.</p>
<p>I mean, you have to understand that it explains so much of the crazy stuff that they did.</p>
<p>Because when I was growing up, this was still the end of the era where in the United States,</p>
<p>the classic thing to say about Hitler was that he was crazy.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;d read about what they would do and they would go, yeah, that&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Only a crazy man would do that.</p>
<p>Well, Tooze points out that only if you consider these fanatical conspiracy theorists to be</p>
<p>crazy would that work, because Hitler&rsquo;s got a logical plan and is actually acting logically.</p>
<p>But only if you&rsquo;re able to see things through that same fanatical conspiracy theorist lens</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s looking at.</p>
<p>For example, the classic stupid maneuver of the Hitlerian regime in the Second World War.</p>
<p>Was there anything worse?</p>
<p>Everybody always likes to say attacking Russia, which was bad.</p>
<p>But remember, when Hitler was already at war with Britain and Russia, he then declared</p>
<p>war on the United States.</p>
<p>The United States didn&rsquo;t declare war on Germany first.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a great what-if scenario that some people play with about what would have</p>
<p>happened if Hitler hadn&rsquo;t declared war on the United States at all.</p>
<p>Because there was still a lot of isolationists in the U.S., a lot of people that would not</p>
<p>have wanted to go to war with Germany would have been able to say, hey, they didn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>anything to us.</p>
<p>The Japanese bombed us, but the Germans didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Interesting counterfactual to play with there.</p>
<p>Hitler takes it right out of everyone&rsquo;s hands and declares war on the United States.</p>
<p>And when I was younger, you just thought, crazy.</p>
<p>But Tews points out, Adam Tews points out, that not if you see the world controlled by</p>
<p>a cabal of Jews who use whole nation states as their puppets to do their bidding.</p>
<p>One of the great weird ironies of Nazism is that Hitler saw Stalin-Soviet Union as</p>
<p>a Jewish Bolshevist communism.</p>
<p>In his mind, communism is Judaism.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re mixed up.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s all the same, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a main Jewish stronghold to Hitler.</p>
<p>But Hitler also thinks that the United States, because it&rsquo;s democracy and freedom and capitalism</p>
<p>is also somehow a sign of Jewishness, that that&rsquo;s also another one of these Jewish puppets.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re fighting Jews and not nation states, well, then declaring war on the United States,</p>
<p>if you think they&rsquo;re this Jewish puppet, all of a sudden makes sense.</p>
<p>And what Tews kind of woke me up to is that if you&rsquo;re operating with this conspiracy theory</p>
<p>as your guide, yeah, the United States is just another one of these alien-controlled</p>
<p>countries that the space aliens are using against us.</p>
<p>You might as well go after them now.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the way Adam Tews encourages us to think about the way that these Nazis&rsquo; worldview</p>
<p>explains a lot.</p>
<p>Quote, President Roosevelt was identified as the chief agent of a worldwide Jewish conspiracy</p>
<p>bent on the destruction of National Socialist Germany.</p>
<p>It was no coincidence that Hitler&rsquo;s famous threat of annihilation of 30th January 1939</p>
<p>came as a direct response to Roosevelt&rsquo;s State of the Union address.</p>
<p>The United States, as everyone understood, was the key to deciding the balance of the</p>
<p>arms race.</p>
<p>If Britain and France could count firmly on American aid, their position would be well-nigh</p>
<p>unassailable.</p>
<p>But the position of the United States was precariously balanced.</p>
<p>Whilst Roosevelt led the rhetorical assault against Hitler and encouraged Britain, France,</p>
<p>and Poland in their resistance to Nazi expansionism, isolationist currents in the United States</p>
<p>were still strong.</p>
<p>Hitler and the rest of the Nazi leadership, he writes, could not help but interpret this</p>
<p>complex situation through the dark haze of Manichean anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>For them, it was obvious that it was Jewish elements in Washington, London, and Paris</p>
<p>bent implacably on the destruction of Nazi Germany that were tightening the international</p>
<p>encirclement.</p>
<p>And it was this paranoid sense of menace that precipitated Hitler&rsquo;s decision to launch</p>
<p>his strike against Poland and then against the Western coalition that continued to stand</p>
<p>obstinately in his way.&quot;</p>
<p>If you wanted to say, you know, what the Germans in both world wars did poorly, because they</p>
<p>were tactically brilliant most of the time, it was the grand strategy stuff.</p>
<p>It was deciding, for example, which countries to go to war with and which wars to fight</p>
<p>or not to fight that they really screwed up in.</p>
<p>And in the Second World War, the reason for declaring wars and accruing more and more</p>
<p>enemies was ideologically based, right?</p>
<p>So the doom of the German military, no matter how good it might have been on the battlefield,</p>
<p>was sealed by the politicians who put them in wars that no one could hope to win.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s getting a little off the subject.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about how the Nazis made the German army weaker in the Second World War and the</p>
<p>difference that you would have had in a system like the First World War Germany that was</p>
<p>more merit-based.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t say it was merit-based, but more merit-based.</p>
<p>Start with the idea that you have all these Nazis in key positions that are incompetent</p>
<p>or untrained or non-expert.</p>
<p>This is not, by the way, a bug.</p>
<p>This is a feature as Hitler sees it.</p>
<p>There are lots of critiques one could pull off the shelf.</p>
<p>And again, all of these people have axes to grind.</p>
<p>So take everything that these ex-Nazi people write with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>But in his famous book, Inside the Third Reich, which may be, I&rsquo;m not sure, it may be the</p>
<p>closest account you&rsquo;ll ever get of the Nazi situation.</p>
<p>Originally his architect, but then the minister of armaments, Albert Speer, wrote his memoirs</p>
<p>after the war.</p>
<p>And when you read them, he&rsquo;ll say things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like reading Churchill&rsquo;s stuff, because instead of saying, they said, and then they</p>
<p>said, it&rsquo;s I said, and then he said, and a lot of the he saids is Hitler.</p>
<p>So in Albert Speer&rsquo;s book, he talks about Hitler&rsquo;s tendency to put people in positions</p>
<p>of authority and great importance in the survival of the state who had never done anything like</p>
<p>what their jobs were going to require in the past, including Speer himself, right?</p>
<p>A guy who had become Hitler&rsquo;s friend because he was an architect who was going to design</p>
<p>Hitler&rsquo;s new Berlin.</p>
<p>And Hitler takes a liking to him and all of a sudden tells the architect, yeah, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be the armaments minister with no experience at all.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the way Speer described it, quote, one can only wonder at the recklessness and</p>
<p>the frivolity with which Hitler appointed me to one of those three or four ministries</p>
<p>on which the existence of his state depended.</p>
<p>I was a complete outsider to the army, to the party, and to industry.</p>
<p>Never in my life had I anything to do with military weapons, for I&rsquo;d never been a soldier.</p>
<p>And up to the time of my appointment, had never even used a rifle as a hunter.</p>
<p>To be sure, it was in keeping with Hitler&rsquo;s dilettantism that he preferred to choose non-specialists</p>
<p>as his associates.</p>
<p>After all, he&rsquo;d already appointed a wine salesman as his foreign minister, his party philosopher</p>
<p>as his minister for eastern affairs, and an erstwhile fighter pilot as overseer of the</p>
<p>entire economy.</p>
<p>Now he was picking an architect of all people to be his minister of armaments.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Hitler preferred to fill positions of leadership with laymen, all his life he&rsquo;d</p>
<p>respected but distrusted professionals, end quote.</p>
<p>And he names a professional, Halmar Schlacht, who was fantastic, and a perfect example of</p>
<p>the kind of people that were merit-based.</p>
<p>Now the perfect example that should prove the rule of what Speer was just saying was</p>
<p>the guy who was second in command in the Nazi regime, the famous Hermann Goring, head of</p>
<p>the Luftwaffe, right?</p>
<p>Arguably the most underperforming branch of the German military?</p>
<p>Goring&rsquo;s story, of course, is fascinating.</p>
<p>He was a dashing, handsome fighter pilot in the First World War, shall we say gone to</p>
<p>seed by the second?</p>
<p>During the wars, he was one of Hitler&rsquo;s comrades, took a bullet in the groin area during the</p>
<p>early Nazi marches.</p>
<p>The pain of that was what was blamed on him becoming a morphine, opioid addict.</p>
<p>And I love the way the great tank general, Heinz Guderian, describes Goring.</p>
<p>You have to understand, another thing that made the Nazi state so much weaker, I think,</p>
<p>than the First World War state, is the Nazi state was full of the most, I mean, it was</p>
<p>like, you know, if Hitler is Taylor Swift, sorry, Taylor Swift, his little gang, his</p>
<p>entourage were a bunch of backbiting.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t even describe the drama.</p>
<p>But Heinz Guderian describes Goring, and it&rsquo;s just the most, the Nazis are the most, in</p>
<p>the 20th century, perverse, wonderful, colorful, awful.</p>
<p>I mean, you can&rsquo;t even, the adjectives are not even there.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what Heinz Guderian writes about Goring, who&rsquo;s in charge of the German Air Force, the</p>
<p>arm that is receiving an inordinate amount of the state&rsquo;s resources because it&rsquo;s seen</p>
<p>as this cutting-edge thing that can win you the war, and then it&rsquo;s going to underperform</p>
<p>time and time again.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what one of the great tank theorists of all time, General Heinz Guderian, wrote</p>
<p>in his post-war memoirs of Goring, and you can just feel, well, I&rsquo;m not even sure what</p>
<p>the emotion is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dripping off the page.</p>
<p>You tell me, he writes, quote,</p>
<p>Once, however, Goring had seen the young German Air Force through its teething troubles.</p>
<p>He surrendered more and more to the charms of newly won power.</p>
<p>He adopted a feudal manner of life, collecting decorations, precious stones, and antiques,</p>
<p>building his famous country seat, Cairn Hall, concentrating with visible results on the</p>
<p>joys of the table.</p>
<p>That just means he&rsquo;s getting fat.</p>
<p>He continues,</p>
<p>On one occasion, while sunk in contemplation of old pictures in an East Prussian castle,</p>
<p>he suddenly cried out, this is Goring,</p>
<p>Magnificent!</p>
<p>I, too, am a man of the Renaissance.</p>
<p>I adore splendor.</p>
<p>Guderian continues, quote,</p>
<p>His style of dress grew ever more eccentric.</p>
<p>At Cairn Hall, or while hunting, he adopted the costume of the ancient Teutons, and when</p>
<p>on duty his uniform was always unorthodox.</p>
<p>He either wore red boots of Russian leather with golden spurs, an item of dress scarcely</p>
<p>essential to an aviator, or else he would appear at Hitler&rsquo;s conferences in long trousers</p>
<p>and black patent leather pumps.</p>
<p>He was strongly scented, and he painted his face.</p>
<p>His fingers were covered with heavy rings in which were set the many large gems that</p>
<p>he loved to display, end quote.</p>
<p>And taking a shot at Goring there for perhaps a little cross-dressing goes a little beyond</p>
<p>the metrosexual, probably.</p>
<p>But at the same time, you know, that&rsquo;s just one of the wonderful hypocrisies of the Nazis</p>
<p>is that they always had a strain of people doing things like that, and there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>wrong with that, unless, of course, you hypocritically make them one of the top targets that you</p>
<p>send to your concentration camps.</p>
<p>The Nazis were extremely hard on sexual minorities, and the fact that they have people in them</p>
<p>that probably could have passed for some just makes it extra, as I said, hypocritical.</p>
<p>Now once again, you think, well, what does this have to do with the army, right?</p>
<p>I mean, this isn&rsquo;t a guy in the field with the weapons, but it is.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all interconnected in ways that you can&rsquo;t separate.</p>
<p>So for example, when Albert Speer gives an account of Hermann Goring shouting down a</p>
<p>German general who&rsquo;s explaining to him really important things that will affect what happens</p>
<p>to the German army, which will affect what happens on the battlefield, Speer writes,</p>
<p>quote, I took part in a session with Goring in the course of which General Thomas expressed</p>
<p>his anxieties about the vast demands the leadership was making upon the economy.</p>
<p>Goring answered the respected general by roaring at him, quote, What business is that of yours?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m handling that.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>Do you hear?</p>
<p>Or are you by any chance in charge of the four-year plan?</p>
<p>You have nothing to say in this matter.</p>
<p>The Fuhrer has entrusted all those questions to me alone, end quote.</p>
<p>Speer says, quote, In such disputes, General Thomas could expect no support from his chief,</p>
<p>General Keitel, who was only too glad to escape being bullied by Goring.</p>
<p>The well-conceived economic plan of the armaments office of the high command of the armed forces</p>
<p>was never carried out.</p>
<p>But as I had already realized by then, Goring did nothing about these problems.</p>
<p>Whenever he did do anything, he usually created total confusion, since he never took the trouble</p>
<p>to work through the problems, but made his decisions on the basis of impulsive inspirations,</p>
<p>end quote.</p>
<p>Goring&rsquo;s one of these guys, and you see this amongst a lot of the Nazi officials, where</p>
<p>theoretically on paper, Goring is not a bad guy to run the Air Force, I mean, with his</p>
<p>qualifications.</p>
<p>The problem is, is those qualifications were created at a time when Goring was a different</p>
<p>guy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a hardcore addict by this time, and his decisions concerning the Luftwaffe are catastrophic</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re German.</p>
<p>Mixed in with these Nazi officials put in place, even in the army, for ideological reasons,</p>
<p>are hardcore professional merit-based people in all these services who are horrified.</p>
<p>One of his generals, Helmut Forster, said of Goring, quote, I&rsquo;ve seen the Reichsmarschall</p>
<p>nod off in mid-conference, for instance, if the conferences went on too long and the morphine</p>
<p>wore off.</p>
<p>That was the commander-in-chief of our Air Force, exclamation point, end quote.</p>
<p>So imagine this Goring question up and down the chain of command and how much that affects</p>
<p>everything.</p>
<p>If you took those Nazi officials out and put people that were more merit-based, let&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>get utopian here, from the First World War sort of standards, you&rsquo;d have a better army</p>
<p>in the Second World War, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s discuss some of the other things besides the merit question that play into this.</p>
<p>In my opinion, as I&rsquo;m making my case here, the Nazi ideology of racial exclusion and</p>
<p>superiority makes the army weaker.</p>
<p>If you go tour some of the German graveyards from the First World War in France, you will</p>
<p>come across, every now and then, but with regularity, a German grave that has a Star</p>
<p>of David on it.</p>
<p>The reasons are obvious, right?</p>
<p>That is a German Jew who fell in service to his country, a patriotic German Jew of the</p>
<p>time period.</p>
<p>They were everywhere, from the rank-and-file soldiery to the scientists, bankers, industrialists,</p>
<p>business people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long list of people who helped the German war effort in the First World War as</p>
<p>loyal Germans to the Kaiser.</p>
<p>The Nazi ideology, of course, turns the state against those people.</p>
<p>And whereas you had good Germans helping the state, now you have an enemy within.</p>
<p>The first thing that happens, of course, is you see a brain drain, and Albert Einstein</p>
<p>will be just one of the people who leaves Germany as times get tough.</p>
<p>He will famously come over to the United States, send that letter to President Roosevelt saying</p>
<p>it might be possible to harness the power of the atom, blah, blah, blah, right?</p>
<p>In the First World War, Albert Einstein stays in Germany and works his physics calculations</p>
<p>for the Kaiser&rsquo;s regime, likely, anyway.</p>
<p>Not only that, but now you have this people who would have been helping the war effort</p>
<p>that now you have to figure out how to, at first, get rid of, and there was a balance</p>
<p>of payment problems, it was complicating matters, but by and large, it just basically means</p>
<p>at some point in the war, you look at a Germany that really, really, really needs to allocate</p>
<p>its resources carefully and wisely, and yet, because of their ideology, have to apportion</p>
<p>a certain amount to wiping out this ethnic group, well, one of many, but the Jews most</p>
<p>prominently, and you had your Gypsies, and you had your Poles, and you had your Russians,</p>
<p>and you had your, I mean, the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>You had your homosexuals, you had your priests, and all of them have to be, you know, warehoused</p>
<p>and exploited and then killed, and I mean, that takes resources from the war effort,</p>
<p>and why are they doing that again?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, ideology.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s switch to what the ideology means in terms of your commanders.</p>
<p>Both World Wars saw the traditional high standards of German generalship upheld, great generals</p>
<p>in both wars, but in the First World War, once again, if you did a good job commanding</p>
<p>troops and you were a winner, you were commanding troops.</p>
<p>In the Second World War, how much the Nazis like you or feel that you are loyal to them</p>
<p>plays a part in whether or not you get an important role.</p>
<p>There were guys like Guderian, who we just quoted, that were sometimes sidelined because</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t ideologically supportive or pure enough, and of course, I mean, we all know</p>
<p>that a decent number of German generals were killed by the regime.</p>
<p>The Desert Fox, Erwin Rommel, one of their great ones, right?</p>
<p>Patton thought he was one of the best, ever.</p>
<p>What did they do to him?</p>
<p>They forced him to commit suicide, why?</p>
<p>Ideological problems.</p>
<p>Again, so not only is it not merit-based in some ways, but if the people who do deserve</p>
<p>those jobs don&rsquo;t conform to the ideology enough, they&rsquo;re gone too.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another thing that&rsquo;s going to make the First World War German military better</p>
<p>than the second.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk economics for a second without getting too deeply into it.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t want me to anyway.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ll start making some mistakes.</p>
<p>But by and large, the Nazis had their own theories on economics, and this is well understood.</p>
<p>In the First World War, they were more, shall we say, orthodox on their economics.</p>
<p>The Germans were very much in the Second World War, and we described steroids earlier.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a bad way to put it.</p>
<p>Leveraging their economy for the short term is another way to put it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another reason why they were more like Mike Tyson, and they&rsquo;re front-loading</p>
<p>their power, and if the fight goes into the later rounds, they&rsquo;re in trouble, and it did,</p>
<p>and they were.</p>
<p>In the First World War, with a better understanding of economics, smarter people at the helm who</p>
<p>were not blinded by ideology, they did better with what they had longer.</p>
<p>Finally, you look at how the ideology boxed the German government in the Second World</p>
<p>War from any sort of outcome that wasn&rsquo;t a total catastrophe.</p>
<p>Take a look at the performances of the two armies and what they did, right?</p>
<p>The German army from the First World War, from the Kaiserreich, those guys are fighting</p>
<p>a two-front war from day one, the worst nightmare of any central continental state, right?</p>
<p>You have Russians in the east, French and British in the west.</p>
<p>How do you deal with that?</p>
<p>Year by year, the Germans in the First World War went around knocking out their enemies.</p>
<p>I mean, they knocked Russia out of the war.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;d they do that?</p>
<p>Well, their plan was to hurt them and then go and get a settlement with them and take</p>
<p>as much of a deal as they could get, right?</p>
<p>They got one of the great treaties of all time, Brest-Litovsk, right?</p>
<p>Famously in Germany&rsquo;s favor.</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t Germany in the Second World War do that?</p>
<p>I mean, they had a lot more going for them.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have to fight a two-front war until 1943.</p>
<p>You knock France out, which they did with a Mike Tyson-like spectacular knockout.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not fighting in any front war for a while.</p>
<p>Then you fight the Soviet Union without having to worry about anyone on your western flank</p>
<p>there on the continent.</p>
<p>Perfect situation.</p>
<p>But by 1942, perhaps, maybe 1943, you&rsquo;ve lost on the eastern front and the second front</p>
<p>is just opening up in Europe and Italy.</p>
<p>So you say, well, why didn&rsquo;t the Germans cut their losses?</p>
<p>When you have all this territory in the Soviet Union, well, in the First World War, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when you make a deal, right?</p>
<p>You go to the Russians and you go, listen, we got all this territory of yours and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to stay here.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll tell you what, you give us a good peace deal, we&rsquo;ll pull back a little.</p>
<p>You know, you can negotiate from that, right?</p>
<p>But the Nazis were hemmed in by their ideology.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t make a deal here.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a battle, you know, for the best deal we can get.</p>
<p>This is, in Hitler&rsquo;s mind, a life or death struggle.</p>
<p>The plans that the Nazi leaders have for this area in the east requires them to move millions</p>
<p>of people eastward, maybe have a starvation plan to start culling the numbers and then</p>
<p>inserting German farmers into this whole, I mean, the entire thing.</p>
<p>There is no plan B here.</p>
<p>There is no place for compromise.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s more, the extreme brutality that Nazi racial superiority and the ideology</p>
<p>that pushed for a brutal campaign in the east pretty much made the people on the other side</p>
<p>in no mood to be cutting any deals with anyone.</p>
<p>Once again, didn&rsquo;t have to be that way.</p>
<p>The German military is always tough on people throughout history, right?</p>
<p>Remember Belgium in 1914?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not a lightweight army when it comes to justice ever, but the crimes of the Nazis</p>
<p>because of the ideological question were so much greater that there was nobody willing</p>
<p>to compromise.</p>
<p>So my opinion, you take the Nazis, you pry the infestation out of the German military</p>
<p>and all the influence that it had over the equipment, tactics, doctrine, strategy and</p>
<p>approach of the German military, and you instantly get stronger.</p>
<p>You put the first world war leadership and ideology, you know, what there was, it was</p>
<p>an aristocratic kind of an ideology, a 19th century ideology.</p>
<p>But you put that in charge of the second world war German army and I bet it&rsquo;s better.</p>
<p>Let me end my attempt at making a case here by once again turning to General Heinz Guderian,</p>
<p>who was not afraid to go up to Hitler and ask the kind of questions that might get some</p>
<p>people, you know, hanging from the end of a meat hook.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s pretty gutsy, but of course, we don&rsquo;t know if this really happened or not.</p>
<p>This is a man&rsquo;s memoirs.</p>
<p>But he says that after he watched Hitler basically, you know, yell in the face of Goring that</p>
<p>he was a disaster, Guderian walks up to him and says, so why is he still here?</p>
<p>He writes, quote, as a result of this conversation, meaning the dressing down of Hermann Goring,</p>
<p>I urged Hitler to act according to what he now realized and to appoint some competent</p>
<p>air force general to succeed the Reichsmarschall.</p>
<p>I told him that we dare not risk losing the whole war on account of the incompetence of</p>
<p>one man like Goring.</p>
<p>But Hitler replied, and this is Hitler talking, and he&rsquo;s showing why the ideology trumps merit.</p>
<p>Hitler, according to Guderian, said, quote, for political reasons, I cannot do as you</p>
<p>suggest.</p>
<p>The party would never understand my motives, end quote.</p>
<p>So if you can&rsquo;t fire Hermann Goring in 1944, near the end of the war, for political reasons,</p>
<p>well that might explain why your military is less formidable than the First World War</p>
<p>military right there.</p>
<p>Remember, we didn&rsquo;t even mention that Goring isn&rsquo;t just in charge of the German air force,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s in charge of the German economy when the four-year plan&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>You could make an argument that at least Goring has a background in fighter aircraft and all</p>
<p>that stuff, because he did, but why would you put that guy in charge of the German economy?</p>
<p>And who is good enough, even among the uber-competent, to be in charge of both?</p>
<p>And of course, we only chose Hermann Goring because he&rsquo;s the most obvious target, the</p>
<p>tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>The Nazis had people like this up and down, as we said, the leadership chain.</p>
<p>Mixed with a lot of uber-competent people, we should point that out, otherwise the Germans</p>
<p>are not as formidable as they were in the Second World War, lots of traditional German</p>
<p>competency.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I compare these Nazis to their war effort, like some sort of parasite, an</p>
<p>infestation, sucking some of the blood of competency out of them, leaving them still</p>
<p>very competent, but weaker than they otherwise would be compared, for example, in my opinion,</p>
<p>to their First World War version.</p>
<p>Now in my account, for brevity&rsquo;s sake, not really my strong point, as you know, I left</p>
<p>out a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t even deal with things like the Navy, you know, in comparison.</p>
<p>First World War German Navy, second most powerful Navy in the world.</p>
<p>Second World War German Navy, nowhere near that, I mean, there&rsquo;s no comparison there.</p>
<p>And in the Air Force, I mean, let&rsquo;s remember, to get back to Goring again, this is an Air</p>
<p>Force that continually delayed the influx of new equipment in terms of new designs,</p>
<p>which as we pointed out earlier, is critical, right?</p>
<p>The technology changes during the war itself, because they&rsquo;re changing things like, well,</p>
<p>do we want this new jet to be a fighter or a bomber or a fighter bomber?</p>
<p>I mean, back and forth, and every time they change their minds, they lose months and months</p>
<p>of production time.</p>
<p>Could have had jet aircraft years earlier, perhaps.</p>
<p>Goring&rsquo;s the guy who told Hitler to have his army stop and not annihilate the British who</p>
<p>were trapped at Dunkirk in 1940, because the Luftwaffe would finish them off, they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Goring&rsquo;s the guy that said he could supply the encircled German troops at Stalingrad,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll do it by air, couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And yet you can&rsquo;t fire him in 1944?</p>
<p>Well, to me, in my opinion, as I said, that is exhibit A right there, that the German</p>
<p>First World War military would have been a more formidable opponent to face in its day</p>
<p>than the Second World War German military was in its day.</p>
