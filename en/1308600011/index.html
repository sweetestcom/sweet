    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>This podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs,</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now</p>
<p>showing that vitamin D3 is essential</p>
<p>for various aspects of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is going to be all about</p>
<p>the science of emotions.</p>
<p>The first month of the podcast,</p>
<p>we talked about sleep and wakefulness.</p>
<p>Last month, we were talking about neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>the brain&rsquo;s ability to change in response to experience.</p>
<p>And this month, we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>these things that we call emotions.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to decipher what they are,</p>
<p>how they work, how we can control them,</p>
<p>when we might not want to control them.</p>
<p>There are going to be four episodes on emotions.</p>
<p>And today, we&rsquo;re going to talk in particular</p>
<p>about something that most often is called stress.</p>
<p>You might be thinking, wait, stress isn&rsquo;t an emotion,</p>
<p>but stress really lies at the heart</p>
<p>of whether or not our internal experience</p>
<p>is matched well or not to our external experience</p>
<p>or the events that are happening to us and around us.</p>
<p>And as you&rsquo;ll soon see, those converge or combine</p>
<p>to create what we call emotions.</p>
<p>Now, I want to be very clear</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to talk about the biology of emotions.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk a little bit</p>
<p>about some psychological concepts related to emotion.</p>
<p>And we are definitely going to talk about tools</p>
<p>to control what we call stress</p>
<p>or commonly think of as stress.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also going to clean up some common myths about stress.</p>
<p>For instance, that stress impairs your immune system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true in certain contexts.</p>
<p>And in other contexts,</p>
<p>stress actually enhances your immune system</p>
<p>and makes it function better.</p>
<p>There is going to be a lot of discussion</p>
<p>about whether or not our internal state,</p>
<p>whether or not we are alert or calm,</p>
<p>is good or bad depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p>So where we&rsquo;re headed here</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;d like you to come away from today&rsquo;s episode</p>
<p>with what I call an organizational logic,</p>
<p>a framework for thinking about these things</p>
<p>that typically we just call happy or sad</p>
<p>or depressed or anxious.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to make sure that you have tools</p>
<p>that are grounded in physiology and neuroscience</p>
<p>that will allow you to navigate</p>
<p>this otherwise complex space that we call emotions</p>
<p>that will allow you to ground yourself better</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re feeling like life is weighing on you</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re kind of being pulled by the currents of life,</p>
<p>as well as to support other people,</p>
<p>whether or not that&rsquo;s in a psychological practice,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a practitioner,</p>
<p>or you have clients or children or spouses,</p>
<p>really to be able to support other people</p>
<p>in your environment better.</p>
<p>And the tools that I&rsquo;m going to focus on today</p>
<p>range from behavioral tools.</p>
<p>We will talk about some of the more valuable</p>
<p>supplementation tools that are out there.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to talk a little bit</p>
<p>about things like depression, PTSD,</p>
<p>but we will be devoting entire episodes</p>
<p>to things like depression, PTSD,</p>
<p>and even attention deficit</p>
<p>and obsessive compulsive disorder,</p>
<p>which believe it or not,</p>
<p>although this might not surprise many of you,</p>
<p>have a very strong emotional component.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about compulsive behaviors</p>
<p>and intrusive thoughts,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also about the emotional load of being in that state.</p>
<p>So I promise that today we&rsquo;re going to clean up</p>
<p>a lot of misunderstanding.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to give you a lot of tools</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to learn a lot about the biology</p>
<p>of how your body and brain work together.</p>
<p>Because if ever there was a topic</p>
<p>that brought together the brain and body</p>
<p>or mind-body relationship,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s stress and emotions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the positive emotions.</p>
<p>When we feel something, whether or not we&rsquo;re super happy</p>
<p>or just feeling kind of pleasant,</p>
<p>or we are feeling stressed, anxious, and overwhelmed,</p>
<p>it isn&rsquo;t just in our head, it&rsquo;s also in our body.</p>
<p>And as you may recall, the nervous system,</p>
<p>which includes the brain and the eyes and the spinal cord,</p>
<p>but also all the connections with the organs of the body,</p>
<p>includes the brain and body.</p>
<p>And those organs of the body,</p>
<p>your gut and your liver and your spleen,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re also communicating with the brain.</p>
<p>So I look forward to a day, in fact,</p>
<p>when we no longer think about neuroscience</p>
<p>as just the brain.</p>
<p>And many neuroscientists now also think about the body,</p>
<p>of course, the brain controls the body,</p>
<p>but the body is also having a very profound</p>
<p>and concrete influence on the brain.</p>
<p>I think up until recently,</p>
<p>people would hear about kind of brain-body</p>
<p>and always think about mindfulness.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re actually not going to talk that much</p>
<p>about mindfulness at all today.</p>
<p>Mindfulness is kind of a vague concept, in fact.</p>
<p>When you think about mindfulness,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good to take the opposite.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the opposite of mindfulness would be mindlessness?</p>
<p>Well, all of a sudden we&rsquo;re into territory</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t really easy for one person</p>
<p>to describe their experience</p>
<p>or to help others with their experience.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to talk about objective tools</p>
<p>that match the brain-body experience</p>
<p>or separate the brain-body experience</p>
<p>in ways that leverage your ability</p>
<p>to lean into life better, to feel better,</p>
<p>literally to just feel better about what you&rsquo;re experiencing</p>
<p>and believe it or not,</p>
<p>to be able to control your emotions when that&rsquo;s appropriate.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t about becoming robotic.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t about trying not to feel human.</p>
<p>This is actually about being able to lean into life better</p>
<p>as a consequence of being able to control</p>
<p>some of your inner real estate.</p>
<p>This nervous system that includes the brain and body</p>
<p>and how that nervous system is interacting</p>
<p>with the outside world.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s to place you in a greater position of power.</p>
<p>And so let&rsquo;s get started in deciphering what is stress?</p>
<p>What are emotions?</p>
<p>And why did I batch stress and emotions</p>
<p>into one discussion today?</p>
<p>Okay, so what is stress?</p>
<p>We hear all the time that stress is bad.</p>
<p>We hear people saying they&rsquo;re really stressed out.</p>
<p>What is stress?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve all presumably heard the arguments or the framework</p>
<p>that stress is this horrible ancient carryover</p>
<p>from times in which humans were pursued by animals</p>
<p>or other human predators.</p>
<p>And that whenever we feel what we call stress</p>
<p>or feel stressed out,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s just this unfortunate invasion</p>
<p>of something that we no longer need in modern life,</p>
<p>that this was designed for when we were being attacked</p>
<p>by bears or tigers or lions or whatever it is.</p>
<p>And gosh, what an unfortunate thing.</p>
<p>And we have so many creature comforts nowadays,</p>
<p>but we have not eliminated this stress.</p>
<p>Almost as if it was like an organ or a system in our body</p>
<p>that was bad for us,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re stuck with just because of the species</p>
<p>that we are.</p>
<p>But first of all, all species experience stress.</p>
<p>And I think that it&rsquo;s fair to say,</p>
<p>even though I wasn&rsquo;t there,</p>
<p>that yes, in fact, throughout our evolutionary history,</p>
<p>we were vulnerable to animal attack</p>
<p>and other human attacks on a regular basis</p>
<p>up until points where we started developing</p>
<p>weapons and structures and fire</p>
<p>and other things that allow us to protect ourselves better</p>
<p>from those animals and invaders of various kinds.</p>
<p>But it is entirely naive for us to think</p>
<p>that in ancient times,</p>
<p>ancient times being a kind of loose term</p>
<p>for previous time, medieval times,</p>
<p>100 years ago, 1,000 years ago, 10,000 years ago,</p>
<p>of course there were infidelities, right?</p>
<p>Partners cheated, people died.</p>
<p>In fact, before the advent of phones,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;re going to talk about today,</p>
<p>you can imagine that someone might head off on a hunt</p>
<p>or to go visit a relative and never come back</p>
<p>and you would never know why.</p>
<p>That would be very stressful.</p>
<p>So there was psychosocial stress.</p>
<p>There was the stress of losing loved ones.</p>
<p>There was the stress of cold, of famine.</p>
<p>There was the stress probably also of just worry.</p>
<p>This idea that ancient versions of humans,</p>
<p>1,000 years ago, 100 years ago, didn&rsquo;t worry,</p>
<p>I think that is entirely inconsistent</p>
<p>with everything we know about the structure</p>
<p>of the human brain 100 years, 1,000 years ago.</p>
<p>So all the problems that we&rsquo;re struggling with</p>
<p>existed forever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that stress at its core is a generalized system.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t designed for tigers attacking us</p>
<p>or people attacking us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a system to mobilize other systems</p>
<p>in the brain and body.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what stress really is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s designed to be generic.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the most important thing</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d like you to understand today</p>
<p>is that the system that governs what we call stress</p>
<p>is generic.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t designed for one thing.</p>
<p>And that gives it a certain advantage</p>
<p>in taking over the state of our brain and body,</p>
<p>but it also gives you, all of us,</p>
<p>an advantage in controlling it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s based on hardwired biological mechanisms.</p>
<p>And there are hardwired biological mechanisms,</p>
<p>meaning cells and chemicals and pathways and tissues</p>
<p>that exist in you right now</p>
<p>that require no neuroplasticity</p>
<p>that allow you to put a brake on stress.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re gonna talk about those.</p>
<p>So you have a system for stress</p>
<p>and you have a system for de-stress</p>
<p>that are baked into you.</p>
<p>They were genetically encoded</p>
<p>and you were born with them and you still have them now.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re alive and listening,</p>
<p>you have the capacity to control your stress.</p>
<p>And today I&rsquo;m gonna talk about ways</p>
<p>that you can control your stress,</p>
<p>not just by doing some offline practice of meditation</p>
<p>or breath work or something like that,</p>
<p>but real-time tools,</p>
<p>tools that allow you to push back on stress</p>
<p>when stress hits in real time.</p>
<p>This is something that my lab works actively on</p>
<p>in developing and testing these tools</p>
<p>and evolving these tools.</p>
<p>And there are other laboratories that do this as well.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about the stress response.</p>
<p>And by doing that,</p>
<p>you will understand exactly why the tools</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna give you work.</p>
<p>For those of you that are saying,</p>
<p>wait, I just want the tools, just give me a summary.</p>
<p>Trust me, if you understand mechanism,</p>
<p>you are going to be in a far better position</p>
<p>to incorporate these tools,</p>
<p>to teach these tools to others,</p>
<p>and to modify them as your life circumstances change.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like the cheat sheet</p>
<p>or you just want the one-page PDF,</p>
<p>eventually we&rsquo;ll get that stuff out to people,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>to understand the underlying mechanism.</p>
<p>Okay, so what is stress?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s just distinguish between stressors,</p>
<p>which are the things that stress us out,</p>
<p>and stress, which is the psychological</p>
<p>and physiological response to stressors.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m mainly gonna talk about stress,</p>
<p>which is your response to things.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be clear about what we already know,</p>
<p>which is that stressors can be psychological</p>
<p>or they can be physical, okay?</p>
<p>If I put you outside on a cold day</p>
<p>without a jacket for a very long time, that is stressful.</p>
<p>If I have you prepare for too many exams at once</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t balance it all with your sleep schedule</p>
<p>and your other needs for comfort and wellbeing,</p>
<p>like food, rest, sleep, and social connection,</p>
<p>that is stressful.</p>
<p>So stress, and as I mentioned before, is generic.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t distinguish between physical</p>
<p>and emotional stress.</p>
<p>So what happens when the stress response hits?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the immediate</p>
<p>or what we call the acute stress response.</p>
<p>We could also think of this as short-term stress.</p>
<p>So you have a collection of neurons.</p>
<p>They have a name.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the sympathetic chain ganglia,</p>
<p>and it has nothing to do with sympathy.</p>
<p>Sympa means together, and there&rsquo;s a group of neurons</p>
<p>that start right about at your neck</p>
<p>and run down to about your navel, a little bit lower,</p>
<p>and those are called the sympathetic chain ganglia.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to memorize that name.</p>
<p>There will not be a quiz,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s important to know that in the middle of your body,</p>
<p>you have a chain of neurons</p>
<p>that when something stresses us out,</p>
<p>either in our mind or because something</p>
<p>enters our environment and we see something</p>
<p>that stresses us out, that we don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>heights if you&rsquo;re afraid of heights,</p>
<p>somebody you dislike walks into the room, et cetera,</p>
<p>that chain of neurons becomes activated</p>
<p>like a bunch of dominoes falling all at once.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very fast.</p>
<p>When that happens, those neurons release a neuromodulator,</p>
<p>neurochemical that I&rsquo;ve talked about before</p>
<p>on this podcast called acetylcholine.</p>
<p>They release that at various sites within the body.</p>
<p>Now, this is important because normally acetylcholine</p>
<p>would be used to move muscles.</p>
<p>Actually, every time we move a muscle,</p>
<p>pick up a cup of coffee, write with a pen,</p>
<p>walk down the street, it&rsquo;s spinal neurons</p>
<p>connecting to muscle and releasing acetylcholine.</p>
<p>So in the brain, it&rsquo;s involved in focus,</p>
<p>and at muscles, it&rsquo;s involved in making muscles twitch.</p>
<p>But if we were stressed,</p>
<p>we wouldn&rsquo;t want all our muscles to contract at once</p>
<p>because we would just be kind of like paralyzed like this,</p>
<p>in what tonic activation as it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>Something called tetanus, believe it or not,</p>
<p>because the tetanus toxin will cause</p>
<p>that kind of rigor of the entire body.</p>
<p>You do not want that.</p>
<p>When those neurons are activated, acetylcholine is released,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some other neurons</p>
<p>for the aficionados out there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called the postganglionic neurons.</p>
<p>Those ones respond to that acetylcholine,</p>
<p>and then they release epinephrine,</p>
<p>which is the equivalent to adrenaline.</p>
<p>So we have this system where very fast,</p>
<p>whenever we&rsquo;re stressed, the core of our body,</p>
<p>these neurons down the middle of our body,</p>
<p>release these chemicals,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s adrenaline or epinephrine</p>
<p>released at particular organs and acts in particular ways.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going down into the weeds here,</p>
<p>so just stay with me</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to make a lot of sense,</p>
<p>and you will appreciate having this knowledge in hand.</p>
<p>That epinephrine acts in two different ways.</p>
<p>Some things like the muscles of your legs and your heart</p>
<p>and other things that need to be active</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re stressed,</p>
<p>they have a certain kind of receptor,</p>
<p>which is called the beta receptor,</p>
<p>and that beta receptor responds to epinephrine</p>
<p>and blood vessels dilate.</p>
<p>They get bigger and blood rushes in to our legs.</p>
<p>The heart rate speeds up.</p>
<p>Lots of things happen that get activated,</p>
<p>and at the same time,</p>
<p>that epinephrine activates other receptors</p>
<p>on certain tissues that we don&rsquo;t need,</p>
<p>the ones involved in digestion, reproduction,</p>
<p>and things of that sort that are luxuries</p>
<p>for when things are going well,</p>
<p>not things to pay attention to when we&rsquo;re stressed,</p>
<p>and that binds to other receptors</p>
<p>that contract the blood vessels.</p>
<p>So basically, the stress response,</p>
<p>this is the key phrase here,</p>
<p>the stress response, A, is generic.</p>
<p>I said that before,</p>
<p>and B, it basically pushes certain systems to be activated</p>
<p>and other systems to not be activated.</p>
<p>So the stress response is two-pronged.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a yes for certain things,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a no, you may not right now for other things.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the key thing to understand</p>
<p>about the stress response.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why your heart speeds up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you feel blood in certain organs</p>
<p>and tissues of your body, but not in others.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why your throat goes dry,</p>
<p>because it turns out that when you get stressed,</p>
<p>the salivary glands are shut down.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot less blood flow to the neurons</p>
<p>that control salivation,</p>
<p>and so you&rsquo;re going to start swallowing.</p>
<p>You feel like your throat is getting dry.</p>
<p>There are a lot of different effects.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to list them all off,</p>
<p>but basically you are activated</p>
<p>in ways that support you moving.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the third thing.</p>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s generic.</p>
<p>Second of all, the stress response activates certain things</p>
<p>and shuts down other features of our body,</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s a sense of agitation</p>
<p>that makes you want to move,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because fundamentally,</p>
<p>the stress response is just this generic thing</p>
<p>that says do something,</p>
<p>and movement in this case can either be the bias</p>
<p>to move in terms of action,</p>
<p>or it can be the bias to say something.</p>
<p>When we are stressed, we are more likely to say something</p>
<p>that probably we shouldn&rsquo;t say.</p>
<p>We are more likely to move,</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re trying to suppress movement,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll feel that as a tremor.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to feel agitated,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because it was designed to move you.</p>
<p>So this is important,</p>
<p>because if you want to control stress,</p>
<p>you need to learn how to work with that agitation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to give you a tool at this point,</p>
<p>because I think if we go any further</p>
<p>with a lot more science,</p>
<p>people are going to begin to wonder</p>
<p>if this is just going to be</p>
<p>a kind of standard university lecture</p>
<p>about the stress response.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to give you more science about the stress response,</p>
<p>but I want to take what we now already know</p>
<p>about the stress response and use that</p>
<p>as a framework for thinking about how one might reduce</p>
<p>or even eliminate the stress response quickly in real time</p>
<p>should it arise when we don&rsquo;t want it.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re taking the podium</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re sitting down at a Zoom call,</p>
<p>and all of a sudden we&rsquo;re feeling flushed.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re feeling like our heart is racing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re feeling a little too alert.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re feeling a little worked up and we want to calm down.</p>
<p>As far as I am aware of,</p>
<p>the best tools to reduce stress quickly,</p>
<p>so-called real-time tools,</p>
<p>are going to be tools that have a direct line</p>
<p>to the so-called autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>The autonomic nervous system is a name</p>
<p>given to the kind of general features of alertness</p>
<p>or calmness in the body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s typically, it means automatic,</p>
<p>although we do have some control over it</p>
<p>at certain so-called levers or entry points.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what doesn&rsquo;t work to control stress.</p>
<p>Telling yourself to calm down.</p>
<p>In fact, that tends to just exacerbate stress.</p>
<p>Telling someone else to calm down</p>
<p>also tends to exacerbate their stress.</p>
<p>If you want to reduce the magnitude of the stress response,</p>
<p>the best thing you can do is activate</p>
<p>the other system in the body,</p>
<p>which is designed for calming and relaxation.</p>
<p>And that system is called the parasympathetic nervous system</p>
<p>because as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>the neurons that control stress</p>
<p>run from about your neck to your navel.</p>
<p>The parasympathetic neurons, para just means near,</p>
<p>exist in, they are some of the cranial nerves.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of neck and lower brain stem,</p>
<p>kind of back of the brain and in the neck,</p>
<p>and in the pelvic area.</p>
<p>And the parasympathetic nervous system</p>
<p>is really interesting</p>
<p>because especially the cranial nerves,</p>
<p>the ones that are up in the brainstem and in the neck area,</p>
<p>those have a direct line to various features of your face,</p>
<p>in particular, the eyes.</p>
<p>They control things like eye movements,</p>
<p>pupil dilation, things of that sort,</p>
<p>as well as the tongue, the facial muscles, et cetera.</p>
<p>The parasympathetic nervous system,</p>
<p>many people don&rsquo;t realize this,</p>
<p>is the system by which we control the face and the eyes,</p>
<p>and to some extent, our airway, the trachea.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s these neurons that reside within the pelvic area.</p>
<p>Now, the neurons within the pelvic area</p>
<p>are involved in control of the genitals,</p>
<p>the bladder, and the rectum.</p>
<p>And those don&rsquo;t have a direct line.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have a direct way to control those.</p>
<p>It actually has to go from brain to spinal cord</p>
<p>and then out to those organs.</p>
<p>Whereas the parasympathetic nervous system</p>
<p>has certain entry points or what I&rsquo;ll call levers, right,</p>
<p>that will allow you to push back on the stress response</p>
<p>in real time and diminish it</p>
<p>and feel more relaxed really quickly.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to teach you the first tool now</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t overwhelm you with all this academic knowledge</p>
<p>without giving you something useful.</p>
<p>And the tool that, at least to my knowledge,</p>
<p>is the fastest and most thoroughly grounded</p>
<p>in physiology and neuroscience</p>
<p>for calming down in a self-directed way</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s called the physiological psi, S-I-G-H.</p>
<p>Now, some of you might&rsquo;ve heard me talk about this</p>
<p>on previous podcasts, but I&rsquo;m going to explain this</p>
<p>in the context of how respiration in general</p>
<p>is used to calm us down.</p>
<p>And it turns out you&rsquo;re all doing this all the time,</p>
<p>but you are doing it involuntarily.</p>
<p>And when you stress, you tend to forget</p>
<p>that you can also activate these systems voluntarily.</p>
<p>This is an extremely powerful set of techniques</p>
<p>that we know from scientific studies</p>
<p>that are being done in my lab,</p>
<p>Jack Feldman&rsquo;s lab at UCLA and others now,</p>
<p>that are very, very useful</p>
<p>for reducing your stress response in real time.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s how they work.</p>
<p>These days, there seems to be a lot of interest</p>
<p>in breathwork.</p>
<p>Breathwork typically is when you go and you sit down</p>
<p>or you lie down and you deliberately breathe</p>
<p>in a particular way for a series of minutes</p>
<p>in order to shift your physiology, access some states.</p>
<p>And it does have some utility that we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>that is not what I&rsquo;m talking about now.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m talking about when I refer to physiological size</p>
<p>is the very real medical school textbook relationship</p>
<p>between the brain, the body,</p>
<p>and the body as it relates to the breathing apparati,</p>
<p>meaning the diaphragm and lungs, and the heart.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take the hallmark of the stress response.</p>
<p>The heart starts beating faster.</p>
<p>Blood is shuttled to the big muscles of the body</p>
<p>to move you away from whatever it is the stressor is</p>
<p>or just make you feel like you need to move or talk,</p>
<p>your face goes flushed, et cetera.</p>
<p>Heart rate, many of us feel is involuntary,</p>
<p>just kind of functions,</p>
<p>whether or not we&rsquo;re moving fast or moving slow.</p>
<p>If you think about it, it&rsquo;s not really purely autonomic</p>
<p>because you can speed up your heart rate by running</p>
<p>or you can slow it down by slowing down, by your run.</p>
<p>You can move to a walk or lie down,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s indirect control.</p>
<p>There is, however, a way in which you can breathe</p>
<p>that directly controls your heart rate</p>
<p>through the interactions between the sympathetic</p>
<p>and the parasympathetic nervous system.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>When you inhale,</p>
<p>so whether or not it&rsquo;s through the nose or through the mouth,</p>
<p>this skeletal muscle that&rsquo;s inside your body</p>
<p>called the diaphragm, it moves down,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because the lungs expand,</p>
<p>the diaphragm moves down.</p>
<p>Your heart actually gets a little bit bigger</p>
<p>in that expanded space.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more space for the heart.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not talking about your emotional heart getting bigger,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about your actual physical heart</p>
<p>getting a little bit bigger, the volume grows.</p>
<p>And as a consequence, whatever blood is in there</p>
<p>is now at a lower volume</p>
<p>or moving a little bit more slowly in that larger volume</p>
<p>than it was before you inhaled, okay?</p>
<p>So more space, heart gets bigger, blood moves more slowly,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a little group of neurons</p>
<p>called the sinoatrial node in the heart</p>
<p>that registers, believe it or not,</p>
<p>those neurons pay attention</p>
<p>to the rate of blood flow through the heart</p>
<p>and send a signal up to the brain</p>
<p>that blood is moving more slowly through the heart.</p>
<p>The brain then sends a signal back to the heart</p>
<p>to speed the heart up.</p>
<p>So what this means is if you want your heart to beat faster,</p>
<p>inhale longer, inhale more vigorously than your exhales.</p>
<p>Now, there are a variety of ways that one could do that,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s through the nose</p>
<p>or through the mouth.</p>
<p>If your inhales are longer than your exhales,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re speeding up your heart.</p>
<p>If your inhales are more vigorous,</p>
<p>so even if your inhales are shorter than your exhales,</p>
<p>you are speeding up your heart rate.</p>
<p>Now, the opposite is also true.</p>
<p>If you want to slow your heart rate down,</p>
<p>so stress response hits,</p>
<p>you want to slow your heart rate down,</p>
<p>what you want to do is, again,</p>
<p>capitalize on this relationship between the body,</p>
<p>meaning the diaphragm and the heart and the brain.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>When you exhale, the diaphragm moves up,</p>
<p>which makes the heart a little bit smaller.</p>
<p>It actually gets a little more compact.</p>
<p>Blood flows more quickly through that compact space,</p>
<p>sort of like just a pipe getting smaller.</p>
<p>The sinoatrial node registers</p>
<p>that blood is going more quickly,</p>
<p>sends a signal up to the brain</p>
<p>and the parasympathetic nervous system,</p>
<p>some neurons in your brainstem,</p>
<p>send a signal back to the heart to slow the heart down.</p>
<p>So if you want to calm down quickly,</p>
<p>you need to make your exhales longer</p>
<p>and or more vigorous than your inhales.</p>
<p>Now, the reason this is so attractive</p>
<p>as a tool for controlling stress</p>
<p>is that it works in real time.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t involve a practice</p>
<p>that you have to go and sit there</p>
<p>and do anything separate from life.</p>
<p>And we are going to get to emotion.</p>
<p>Emotions and stress happen in real time.</p>
<p>And so while it&rsquo;s wonderful to have a breathwork practice</p>
<p>or to have the opportunity to get a massage</p>
<p>or sit in a sauna or do whatever it is that you do</p>
<p>in order to set your stress controls in the right direction,</p>
<p>having tools that you can reach to in real time</p>
<p>that require no learning.</p>
<p>I mean, I had to teach it to you.</p>
<p>You had to learn that,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t require any plasticity</p>
<p>to activate these pathways.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re feeling stressed,</p>
<p>you still need to inhale, of course,</p>
<p>but you need to lengthen your exhales.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a tool that capitalizes on this</p>
<p>in a kind of unique way, a kind of a twist,</p>
<p>which is the physiological sigh.</p>
<p>The physiological sigh was discovered in the 30s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now been explored at the neurobiological level</p>
<p>and mechanistically in far more detail</p>
<p>by Jack Feldman&rsquo;s lab at UCLA,</p>
<p>also Mark Krasno&rsquo;s lab at Stanford.</p>
<p>And the physiological sigh is something</p>
<p>that humans and animals do</p>
<p>anytime they are about to fall asleep.</p>
<p>You also do it throughout sleep from time to time</p>
<p>when carbon dioxide, which we&rsquo;ll talk about in a moment,</p>
<p>builds up too much in your system.</p>
<p>And the physiological sigh is something</p>
<p>that people naturally start doing</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;ve been crying</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re trying to recover some air or calm down,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;ve been sobbing very hard,</p>
<p>or when they are in claustrophobic environments.</p>
<p>However, the amazing thing about this thing</p>
<p>that we call the diaphragm, the skeletal muscle,</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s an internal organ</p>
<p>that you can control voluntarily,</p>
<p>unlike your spleen or your heart or your pancreas,</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t just say,</p>
<p>oh, I want to make my pancreas</p>
<p>churn out a little more insulin right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to do that with my mind directly.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>You could do that by smelling</p>
<p>a really good donut or something,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t just do it directly.</p>
<p>You can move your diaphragm intentionally, right?</p>
<p>You can do it anytime you want,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll run in the background</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not thinking about it.</p>
<p>So this incredible pathway that goes from brain to diaphragm</p>
<p>through what&rsquo;s called the phrenic nerve,</p>
<p>P-H-R-E-N-I-C, phrenic.</p>
<p>The phrenic nerve innervates the diaphragm.</p>
<p>You can control it anytime you want.</p>
<p>You can double up your inhales or triple up your inhales.</p>
<p>You can exhale more than your inhales,</p>
<p>whatever you want to do.</p>
<p>Such an incredible organ.</p>
<p>And the physiological sigh</p>
<p>is something that we do spontaneously,</p>
<p>but when you&rsquo;re feeling stressed,</p>
<p>you can do a double inhale.</p>
<p>Long exhale.</p>
<p>Now, I just told you a minute ago</p>
<p>that if you inhale more than you exhale,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to speed the heart rate up,</p>
<p>which would promote more stress and activation.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m telling you to do a double inhale exhale</p>
<p>in order to calm down.</p>
<p>And the reason is the double inhale exhale,</p>
<p>which is the physiological sigh,</p>
<p>takes advantage of the fact</p>
<p>that when we do a double inhale,</p>
<p>even if the second inhale is sneaking</p>
<p>in just a tiny bit more air,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s kind of hard to get</p>
<p>two deep inhales back to back.</p>
<p>You do big, deep inhale,</p>
<p>and then another little one sneaking it in.</p>
<p>The little sacs in your lungs,</p>
<p>the alveoli of the lungs,</p>
<p>your lungs aren&rsquo;t just two big bags,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve got millions of little sacs</p>
<p>throughout the lungs</p>
<p>that actually make the surface area of your lungs</p>
<p>as big as a tennis court.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>If we were to just spread that out.</p>
<p>Those tend to collapse as we get stressed,</p>
<p>and carbon dioxide builds up in our bloodstream,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s one of the reasons we feel agitated as well.</p>
<p>So, and it makes us very jittery.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s some other effects of carbon dioxide</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get into,</p>
<p>but when you do the double inhale, exhale,</p>
<p>the double inhale reinflates</p>
<p>those little sacs of the lungs,</p>
<p>and then when you do the long exhale,</p>
<p>that long exhale is now much more effective</p>
<p>at ridding your body and bloodstream of carbon dioxide,</p>
<p>which relaxes you very quickly.</p>
<p>My lab, in collaboration with David Spiegel&rsquo;s lab,</p>
<p>David&rsquo;s the Associate Chair of Psychiatry at Stanford,</p>
<p>are doing a study right now,</p>
<p>exploring how physiological size</p>
<p>and other patterns of breathing done deliberately</p>
<p>can modulate the stress response</p>
<p>and other things related to emotionality.</p>
<p>Those work are ongoing.</p>
<p>I want to be clear, those studies aren&rsquo;t done,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very clear from work in our labs,</p>
<p>from work in Jack Feldman&rsquo;s lab and others,</p>
<p>that the physiological sigh is the fastest hardwired way</p>
<p>for us to eliminate this stressful response in our body</p>
<p>quickly in real time.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m excited to give you this tool</p>
<p>because I think most people have heard</p>
<p>that mindfulness and meditation is good,</p>
<p>exercise is good for us,</p>
<p>we all need to be getting enough sleep, et cetera,</p>
<p>but life happens.</p>
<p>And when you find yourself in a position</p>
<p>where you are more alert and activated</p>
<p>than you would like to be,</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not the stressor</p>
<p>is relationship-based or it&rsquo;s financial or it&rsquo;s physical</p>
<p>or anything like that,</p>
<p>you can look to the physiological side</p>
<p>because it bypasses a very important feature</p>
<p>of how we function, which is that it&rsquo;s very hard</p>
<p>to control the mind with the mind,</p>
<p>especially when we are in heightened states of activation.</p>
<p>When we are very alert or very sleepy,</p>
<p>it is very hard to use these so-called top-down mechanisms</p>
<p>of intention and gratitude and all these things</p>
<p>that are really powerful tools</p>
<p>when we are not super activated and stressed</p>
<p>or not super tired.</p>
<p>But when we are anywhere in the range of very alert</p>
<p>and stressed to very sleepy,</p>
<p>physiological sides are a powerful way</p>
<p>of bringing our level of so-called autonomic activation,</p>
<p>which just means our level of alertness down.</p>
<p>And so whether or not it&rsquo;s in line at the bank</p>
<p>or whether or not you&rsquo;re wearing a mask nowadays</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re not, whatever the conditions may be</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re at and your needs,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re feeling stressed,</p>
<p>the physiological side done just one to three times,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;d be double inhale, exhale, double inhale, exhale,</p>
<p>maybe just two times,</p>
<p>will bring down your level of stress very, very fast.</p>
<p>And as far as I know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the fastest way to accomplish that.</p>
<p>An important note about the physiological side</p>
<p>or exhale-emphasized breathing</p>
<p>for lowering the stress response.</p>
<p>Many people worry that their heart rate</p>
<p>does not come down fast enough.</p>
<p>I want to tell you,</p>
<p>you do not want your heart rate to reduce very fast.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually something called the vasovagal response</p>
<p>where people will stand up</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ll get up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>to use the bathroom,</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden they&rsquo;ll collapse, they&rsquo;ll faint.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because the heart rate was reduced too much.</p>
<p>Some people will see blood</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ll see something really troubling and stressful</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll pass out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an over-activation</p>
<p>or an acceleration of the calming response.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not so stressed</p>
<p>that they kind of fall off the cliff of stress.</p>
<p>They get so stressed that the rebound mechanism</p>
<p>for calming themselves down goes too high, too fast.</p>
<p>They calm down too fast and they collapse and faint.</p>
<p>And so be aware that if you&rsquo;re going to use</p>
<p>the physiological side</p>
<p>or exhale-emphasized breathing to calm down</p>
<p>that your heart rate will take about 20 to 30 seconds</p>
<p>to come down to baseline.</p>
<p>And you may need to repeat the physiological side</p>
<p>a few times.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an important note about the use of breathing</p>
<p>to control levels of stress.</p>
<p>The other thing is that when you decide to look to the body</p>
<p>to control the mind,</p>
<p>it does something else that&rsquo;s very powerful.</p>
<p>When you are stressed in your mind and body,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re feeling really agitated, activated, and worried,</p>
<p>and you use a tool like the physiological side</p>
<p>or exhale-emphasized breathing,</p>
<p>you will notice that then your brain and your mind</p>
<p>becomes more available</p>
<p>for controlling the stress response and reacting to it,</p>
<p>which is great because the sweet spot in life</p>
<p>is to be, provided you&rsquo;re not trying to sleep,</p>
<p>is to be alert and calm.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the idea is to be alert and calm</p>
<p>and to bring you back into that sort of plane of alertness.</p>
<p>For those of you that have trouble sleeping</p>
<p>or just relaxing through the day,</p>
<p>the physiological side can be repeated</p>
<p>for 10, 15 cycles if you like.</p>
<p>Some people find that it actually puts them to sleep.</p>
<p>So if they lie down and they&rsquo;re reading</p>
<p>and they do too many of these,</p>
<p>that actually can put them to sleep.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;ll find is that most breath work protocols,</p>
<p>the kind of stuff that&rsquo;s done away from real life</p>
<p>that you set aside time</p>
<p>and decide to do quote-unquote breath work,</p>
<p>most of that works such that if you&rsquo;re doing inhales</p>
<p>that are longer and more vigorous than exhales,</p>
<p>it tends to be activating and alert you.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re doing exhales</p>
<p>that are longer and more vigorous than the inhales,</p>
<p>it tends to put you to sleep.</p>
<p>And many of the protocols that are out there</p>
<p>from laboratories and that populate the internet</p>
<p>and wellness sites and whatnot,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s exhale-emphasized breathing,</p>
<p>oftentimes it&rsquo;s been used as a tool</p>
<p>for trying to teach people to fall asleep.</p>
<p>Physiological size, a little different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s designed to be used in real time.</p>
<p>Just think of it as just kind of in your kit of things</p>
<p>that you can do as life happens</p>
<p>and as you need to react to life.</p>
<p>A note about nasal versus mouth breathing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a plethora of information out there now</p>
<p>because of James Nestor&rsquo;s book,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Breath, the New Science of a Lost Art,&rdquo;</p>
<p>which came out this last year, excellent book,</p>
<p>as well as JAWS, which is from Sandra Kahn, Paul Ehrlich,</p>
<p>with a forward by Jared Diamond and Robert Sapolsky.</p>
<p>So a collection of people from Stanford.</p>
<p>Jared Diamond&rsquo;s not at Stanford, but the rest are.</p>
<p>And some heavy hitters on that book,</p>
<p>which is about the benefits of nasal breathing.</p>
<p>And in many cases,</p>
<p>nasal breathing is more advantageous than mouth breathing</p>
<p>for all sorts of things,</p>
<p>cosmetic features of the face, especially in kids,</p>
<p>warding off infection, et cetera.</p>
<p>With the physiological sigh,</p>
<p>the best way to do it would be double inhale</p>
<p>through the nose, exhale through the mouth.</p>
<p>But if you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and you can only do that through your mouth,</p>
<p>just do it through your mouth.</p>
<p>If you want to do all through your nose,</p>
<p>do it through your nose.</p>
<p>This anchors back to some underlying neurology</p>
<p>or neuroscience.</p>
<p>So for those of you that want to know,</p>
<p>you have two breathing centers,</p>
<p>one that&rsquo;s involved in rhythmic breathing for inhales,</p>
<p>followed by exhales, followed by inhales, followed by exhales</p>
<p>the so-called pre-Botzinger nucleus</p>
<p>named after a bottle of wine</p>
<p>and discovered by Jack Feldman at UCLA.</p>
<p>And a nearby nucleus called the parafacial nucleus</p>
<p>also discovered by Jack Feldman at UCLA.</p>
<p>And the parafacial nucleus is involved</p>
<p>in anytime you double up the inhales</p>
<p>or double up the exhales.</p>
<p>It was designed so that you could breathe</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re speaking</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t always go inhale, exhale,</p>
<p>inhale, exhale when you&rsquo;re speaking.</p>
<p>So I tell you this not to overwhelm you with knowledge,</p>
<p>but just know that when you double up your inhales</p>
<p>or you double up your exhales,</p>
<p>you are activating this parafacial nucleus</p>
<p>and it has other cool effects</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s located near the neurons that control the face.</p>
<p>It also has a tendency to relax the jaw.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some interplay between the neurons</p>
<p>that control the speaking stuff</p>
<p>and the stuff for your tongue.</p>
<p>So all of a sudden when we do this physiological sigh,</p>
<p>we tap into neural circuitry</p>
<p>that allows us to speak more clearly,</p>
<p>to control the muscles of the face and jaw.</p>
<p>Maybe that means not saying certain things</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re stressed and just generally to relax.</p>
<p>And so this brings us back to the neuroscience</p>
<p>of this parasympathetic nervous system,</p>
<p>this calming system that&rsquo;s been genetically encoded into us</p>
<p>that we all have, regardless of who our parents are,</p>
<p>which is that the neurons that control all this stuff,</p>
<p>the face, the eyes, et cetera, are all working together.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why when we get stressed,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard for us to speak</p>
<p>or we tend to jitter and these kinds of things,</p>
<p>just like all the neurons that cause stress</p>
<p>in the center of the spinal cord</p>
<p>are working together to get our body activated.</p>
<p>Okay, a lot of science today.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve now got the physiological sigh as a tool.</p>
<p>You know that exhale-emphasized breathing</p>
<p>will slow your heart down</p>
<p>and inhale-emphasized breathing will speed your heart up.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s think about something now.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s think about stress</p>
<p>from not whether or not it&rsquo;s acute or chronic,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s good for us or bad for us,</p>
<p>but on three different timescales,</p>
<p>because then we can arrive at what this is all about</p>
<p>as it relates to emotions.</p>
<p>Because trust me, this has everything to do with emotions</p>
<p>and whether or not you&rsquo;re functioning well emotionally</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re not functioning well emotionally,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re coping or not coping.</p>
<p>So those are typically psychological terms</p>
<p>and psychological discussions.</p>
<p>We are entering this through the portal of physiology,</p>
<p>the stuff of medical textbooks,</p>
<p>and we will arrive at the psychology soon,</p>
<p>but I really want you to understand the difference</p>
<p>between the three kinds of stress</p>
<p>on three different timescales,</p>
<p>short-term, medium-term, and long-term,</p>
<p>and what it&rsquo;s good for and what it&rsquo;s bad for.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve all heard that stress is bad for us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen these pictures intended to frighten us,</p>
<p>and indeed they are frightening.</p>
<p>You see the nice, really plump brain on the left</p>
<p>that says healthy or control,</p>
<p>and then you see the brain that says stressed</p>
<p>above it on the right, and it&rsquo;s like withered,</p>
<p>or we see that the hippocampus,</p>
<p>an area involved in memory, is smaller.</p>
<p>People there are stressed.</p>
<p>We see that the Alzheimer&rsquo;s brain is made worse by stress,</p>
<p>that people who have a predisposition to schizophrenia,</p>
<p>when they get stressed,</p>
<p>higher incidence of schizophrenic episodes.</p>
<p>You hear that addicts will relapse when they&rsquo;re stressed.</p>
<p>I mean, okay, we get it, and it&rsquo;s very important,</p>
<p>but I think we&rsquo;ve all heard now so many times</p>
<p>that stress is bad,</p>
<p>but in that conversation, unfortunately,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s eclipsed some of the really positive things</p>
<p>that stress does for us in the short-term.</p>
<p>So stress can be short-term, medium-term, or long-term.</p>
<p>Long-term stress is indeed bad</p>
<p>for all the reasons I just mentioned and many others,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s never actually been discussed</p>
<p>is what stress is so terrific for,</p>
<p>positive for in the short-term,</p>
<p>and I think we tend to overlook the important question,</p>
<p>which is what is short-term and what is long-term?</p>
<p>No one ever bothers to tell us what is chronic,</p>
<p>what is acute, right?</p>
<p>Is it five minutes?</p>
<p>Is it five days?</p>
<p>Is it for the duration of final exams,</p>
<p>or is it for the duration of a senior thesis in college?</p>
<p>No one actually draws boundaries around this stuff,</p>
<p>or even general guidelines,</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s become a bit of a mess, frankly,</p>
<p>to try and decipher this whole space around stress,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m going to try and clean some of this up for you</p>
<p>based on what we know from the scientific data.</p>
<p>First of all, acute stress, when the stress response hits,</p>
<p>that is good for your immune system.</p>
<p>I know that might be a tough pill to swallow,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s absolutely true.</p>
<p>In fact, stress often comes in the form</p>
<p>of bacterial or viral infection,</p>
<p>and the stress response is, in part,</p>
<p>organized to combat bacterial and viral infection.</p>
<p>There are pathways from the same brain centers</p>
<p>that activate these neurons in your spinal cord</p>
<p>to make you feel like you want to move.</p>
<p>There are other neurons in your brain</p>
<p>that activate things like your spleen,</p>
<p>which will deploy killer cells to go out</p>
<p>and scavenge for incoming bacteria and viruses</p>
<p>and try and eat them up and kill them.</p>
<p>So short-term stress</p>
<p>and the release of adrenaline in particular, or epinephrine,</p>
<p>same thing, adrenaline, epinephrine,</p>
<p>is good for combating infection,</p>
<p>and this, to me, is just not discussed enough,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m discussing it here,</p>
<p>and it relates to a particular tool</p>
<p>that many of you ask about,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t often get the opportunity to talk about</p>
<p>in such an appropriate context.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s ever inappropriate to talk about,</p>
<p>but what I&rsquo;m about to talk about now</p>
<p>is the use of, again, respiration, breathing,</p>
<p>to somewhat artificially activate the stress response,</p>
<p>and that will accomplish two things, okay?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll return to medium and long-term stress,</p>
<p>but I want to say short-term stress is good</p>
<p>because the dilation of the pupils,</p>
<p>the changes in the optics of the eyes,</p>
<p>the quickening of the heart rate,</p>
<p>the sharpening of your cognition,</p>
<p>and in fact, that short-term stress</p>
<p>brings certain elements of the brain online</p>
<p>that allow you to focus.</p>
<p>Now, it narrows your focus.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not good at seeing the so-called big picture,</p>
<p>but it narrows your focus.</p>
<p>It allows you to do these,</p>
<p>what I call duration path outcome types of analysis.</p>
<p>It allows you to evaluate your environment,</p>
<p>evaluate what you need to do.</p>
<p>It primes your whole system for better cognition.</p>
<p>It primes your immune system to combat infection,</p>
<p>and that all makes sense when you think about the fact</p>
<p>that famine, thirst, bacterial infections,</p>
<p>viral infections, invaders, all of this stuff</p>
<p>liberates a response in the body</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s designed to get you to fight back</p>
<p>against whatever stressor that happens to be,</p>
<p>psychological, physical, bacterial, viral.</p>
<p>Again, the stress response is generic.</p>
<p>The tool takes advantage of the fact</p>
<p>that when adrenaline is released in the body</p>
<p>from the adrenals,</p>
<p>it has the effect of also liberating</p>
<p>a lot of these killer cells from the immune organs,</p>
<p>in particular from the spleen,</p>
<p>but from elsewhere as well,</p>
<p>and interactions with the lymphatic system</p>
<p>that combat infection.</p>
<p>The way this works in the real world</p>
<p>is best captured by a study</p>
<p>that can be mapped back to so-called Wim Hof breathing.</p>
<p>Now, Wim Hof breathing is so named</p>
<p>after the so-called Iceman Wim Hof.</p>
<p>Wim, of course, being this Dutch,</p>
<p>I think his self-titled daredevil,</p>
<p>and indeed he has many, many Guinness Book of World Records</p>
<p>for things like swimming under icebergs</p>
<p>and going up Kilimanjaro in his shorts</p>
<p>and crossing the desert without water, et cetera,</p>
<p>things that are quite dangerous</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And Wim obviously survived,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m telling you he survived.</p>
<p>But there are two components</p>
<p>to a sort of breathing protocol that he developed</p>
<p>that was based also on what&rsquo;s called TUMO breathing,</p>
<p>T-U-M-M-O.</p>
<p>So before Wim, there was TUMO breathing.</p>
<p>And many people call this now super oxygenation breathing,</p>
<p>although the breath work aficionados will probably say,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s not super oxygenation</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re also blowing off a lot of carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m talking about here,</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not it&rsquo;s called Wim Hof, TUMO,</p>
<p>or super oxygenation is rapid deliberate breathing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s deliberate hyperventilation.</p>
<p>Why would somebody want to do this?</p>
<p>Well, deliberate hyperventilation done for maybe 25 cycles.</p>
<p>So inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale.</p>
<p>Typically it&rsquo;s done in through the nose,</p>
<p>out through the mouth,</p>
<p>although sometimes it&rsquo;s just through the mouth.</p>
<p>If you do that for 15 breaths, 20 breaths, 25 breaths,</p>
<p>you will feel very alert.</p>
<p>People who have anxiety will feel anxious.</p>
<p>They might even have an anxiety attack.</p>
<p>However, we need to ask why that kind of breathing</p>
<p>feels that way.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because that pattern of breathing,</p>
<p>rapid movements of the diaphragm</p>
<p>will liberate adrenaline from the adrenals.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the release of adrenaline.</p>
<p>I mentioned that Wim is also called the Iceman.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s because he actually discovered</p>
<p>this pattern of breathing somewhat.</p>
<p>And again, it maps back to TUMO breathing</p>
<p>by going into cold water.</p>
<p>When you go into cold water, that too is a stressor</p>
<p>and you liberate adrenaline in response to cold water.</p>
<p>So if you get into an ice bath or a cold shower,</p>
<p>you will immediately release adrenaline from your adrenals.</p>
<p>Now, there are all sorts of things related to this</p>
<p>about psychological control and stress thresholds</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll talk about.</p>
<p>But I really want people to understand</p>
<p>that when adrenaline is released in the body,</p>
<p>you are in a better position to combat infections.</p>
<p>And so whether or not you breathe very quickly</p>
<p>in these cycles of 25 breaths,</p>
<p>and regardless of what you call it, doesn&rsquo;t matter,</p>
<p>adrenaline is released.</p>
<p>If you take a cold shower, adrenaline is released.</p>
<p>If you go into an ice bath deliberately,</p>
<p>and even if you do it non-deliberately,</p>
<p>adrenaline is released.</p>
<p>You are mimicking the stress response.</p>
<p>And that adrenaline serves to suppress</p>
<p>or combat incoming infections.</p>
<p>And this was beautifully shown in a study</p>
<p>that was published in a very fine journal,</p>
<p>the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</p>
<p>for the US, it&rsquo;s literally called</p>
<p>Proceedings of the National Academy of USA</p>
<p>to distinguish it from other proceedings</p>
<p>of other national academies in other countries.</p>
<p>The way the experiment went is that people</p>
<p>were injected with endotoxin,</p>
<p>or in some cases they were injected</p>
<p>with a bacterial wall that mimics infection.</p>
<p>It gives you a fever.</p>
<p>It makes you feel nauseous.</p>
<p>It makes you feel sick.</p>
<p>It is not pleasant.</p>
<p>Half of the people did a particular pattern of breathing</p>
<p>that looked very much like the pattern of breathing</p>
<p>I described a moment ago</p>
<p>of doing 25 deep inhales and exhales</p>
<p>followed by an exhale, holding their breath,</p>
<p>then repeating, 25 inhales, exhales, holding their breath.</p>
<p>So this would look something like this,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re listening, it sounds like,</p>
<p>ah, ah, ah, 25, 30 times, you&rsquo;ll start feeling heated up.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll start feeling the adrenaline response.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re liberating adrenaline in your body.</p>
<p>Then exhale, hold your breath for 15 seconds,</p>
<p>and then repeat.</p>
<p>And then typically after doing three or four rounds of that,</p>
<p>they would inhale very deeply and hold their breath.</p>
<p>Now, I want to emphasize,</p>
<p>never, ever, ever do this anywhere near water.</p>
<p>People have passed out, so-called shallow water breath out.</p>
<p>People have died.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do it in the bathtub, do it in the hot tub.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do it before swimming.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t do it anywhere near water.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t do it at all</p>
<p>unless you get clearance to do it from your doctor</p>
<p>because there are some pulmonary effects and whatnot.</p>
<p>And the breath holds should definitely not be done</p>
<p>by anyone that has glaucoma or pressure,</p>
<p>you know, concerns for the eyes.</p>
<p>But these repeated cycles of breathing</p>
<p>that liberate adrenaline allowed the group</p>
<p>that did that protocol to essentially experience</p>
<p>zero symptoms from the injection of this E.coli,</p>
<p>which is remarkable.</p>
<p>They had much reduced or no symptoms.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t feel feverish.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t feel sick.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t vomiting, no diarrhea, which is remarkable,</p>
<p>but makes total sense when you think about the fact</p>
<p>that the short-term stress response,</p>
<p>that what&rsquo;s typically called the acute stress response</p>
<p>is designed to combat all stressors.</p>
<p>In fact, were you to cut yourself very deeply</p>
<p>while out on a hike in the woods,</p>
<p>the other thing that would happen</p>
<p>is that there would be a rapid inflammation response.</p>
<p>And we always hear inflammation is bad.</p>
<p>Inflammation gives us Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Inflammation is the worst thing,</p>
<p>but the swelling is associated,</p>
<p>the inflammation is associated with the recruitment</p>
<p>of things like macrophages or microglia,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a neural tissue, cells in our brain and body</p>
<p>whose job is to act like little ambulances</p>
<p>and rush to that site and clean it up</p>
<p>and indeed the inflammation response looks horrible.</p>
<p>It sounds horrible, but it&rsquo;s a great thing</p>
<p>in the short term.</p>
<p>You want to have that tissue marked as in trouble</p>
<p>and you want the body and brain to react to it.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re getting peaks in stress from time to time</p>
<p>throughout your day or throughout your week,</p>
<p>you are in a better position to combat infection.</p>
<p>You are in a better position to heal your wounds,</p>
<p>physical wounds.</p>
<p>Many great things happen in the stress response.</p>
<p>Now, of course, the stress response</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t always super intense.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s milder.</p>
<p>Sometimes it allows us to just focus on something</p>
<p>because we have a deadline that can feel stressful,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s one of the reasons</p>
<p>you procrastinators out there,</p>
<p>people are always asking me,</p>
<p>what can be done for procrastination?</p>
<p>What can be done for procrastination</p>
<p>is you can understand what&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>which is that you are self-imposing stress</p>
<p>because stress acts like a drug.</p>
<p>It is a powerful nootropic.</p>
<p>I get asked about nootropics.</p>
<p>The most powerful nootropic or smart drug is stress.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the concern of failure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the desire to do well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the impending deadline.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the, oh my gosh, I have to do this thing now</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m going to fail.</p>
<p>That is the best nootropic you will ever find.</p>
<p>That combined with a good night&rsquo;s sleep,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll talk about,</p>
<p>but we spent a whole month on sleep,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t want to backtrack too much, okay?</p>
<p>So short-term stress, great.</p>
<p>The key is to be able to turn the stress response off</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re done, when you don&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>In fact, let&rsquo;s just really tamp down the relationship</p>
<p>between the short-term or acute stress response</p>
<p>and infection.</p>
<p>Many of us are familiar with the experience</p>
<p>of work, work, work, work, work,</p>
<p>or taking care of a loved one,</p>
<p>or stress, stress, stress, stress, stress.</p>
<p>Then we finally relax.</p>
<p>Maybe we even go on vacation.</p>
<p>Like, oh, now I&rsquo;m finally going to get the break.</p>
<p>And then we get sick.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because the adrenaline response crashed</p>
<p>and your immune system crashed with it.</p>
<p>So please understand this.</p>
<p>Now, many of you might say, well, how long is it?</p>
<p>Two hours, is it three hours?</p>
<p>A lot of you out there that really like specificity.</p>
<p>It will vary for everybody.</p>
<p>I would just kind of use a rule of thumb.</p>
<p>When you are no longer able to achieve good sleep,</p>
<p>what good sleep means to you,</p>
<p>and please see the episodes on sleep</p>
<p>if you want more about tools to sleep.</p>
<p>When you are no longer able to achieve good sleep,</p>
<p>you are now moving from acute stress to chronic stress.</p>
<p>You need to be able to turn the stress response off.</p>
<p>If I have one wish, well, I have many wishes</p>
<p>for this lifetime, but if I have one wish today</p>
<p>that I hope will permeate and spread out there</p>
<p>is this idea that we need from a young age,</p>
<p>but even as adults and forever,</p>
<p>we need to learn how to turn off our stress response.</p>
<p>Physiological sigh is one.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re going to activate our stress response intentionally</p>
<p>by ice baths, cold showers,</p>
<p>cyclic hyperoxygenated breathing,</p>
<p>aka Tumo breathing or Wim Hof breathing,</p>
<p>we also need to learn how to press the break, okay?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s think about the stress system.</p>
<p>It knows how to activate itself.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re talking about a way</p>
<p>of deliberately activating your stress system</p>
<p>in order to combat infection.</p>
<p>I do this from time to time.</p>
<p>I might feel a tickle in my throat</p>
<p>or like I&rsquo;m getting kind of run down.</p>
<p>I will do this kind of breathing, I do.</p>
<p>I will take 25 or 30 breaths, exhale, hold my breath.</p>
<p>25, 30 breaths again, exhale,</p>
<p>hold my breath for about 15 seconds.</p>
<p>25, 30 breaths again, exhale,</p>
<p>hold my breath for 25 or 30 seconds,</p>
<p>then a big inhale and I hold my breath</p>
<p>until I feel the impulse to breathe.</p>
<p>Again, I feel it safe for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve run it by my doctor, so it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>You should not do this unless it&rsquo;s right for you,</p>
<p>but I do this.</p>
<p>Some people like the ice bath.</p>
<p>I rarely do the ice bath.</p>
<p>Some people like cold showers.</p>
<p>I like hot showers.</p>
<p>So I take hot showers, but I do this kind of breathing.</p>
<p>Again, they are all having more or less the same effect</p>
<p>of increasing adrenaline,</p>
<p>which allows you to combat the infection</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re activating the immune response.</p>
<p>Okay, so now let&rsquo;s talk about medium-term stress.</p>
<p>Medium-term stress is going to be stress</p>
<p>that lasts anywhere from several days to several weeks.</p>
<p>Okay, we might think of that as long-term stress.</p>
<p>There are times in life</p>
<p>when we are just dealing with a lot, okay?</p>
<p>This particular quarter I happen to be directing a course,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing the lab, I&rsquo;m doing this.</p>
<p>I enjoy all these things immensely,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m kind of near my threshold.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m near the point where any additional thing,</p>
<p>like I couldn&rsquo;t log onto a website the other day</p>
<p>and it felt like the most intense thing</p>
<p>in the world at that moment,</p>
<p>and I kind of laughed at myself.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I caught it,</p>
<p>but that typically wouldn&rsquo;t be my response</p>
<p>under conditions where I wasn&rsquo;t pushed to threshold.</p>
<p>What is this medium-term stress?</p>
<p>What is stress threshold?</p>
<p>Well, stress threshold is actually our ability</p>
<p>to cognitively regulate what&rsquo;s going on in our body.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve all hear so much about,</p>
<p>we need to unify our mind and body.</p>
<p>We need to be at one with our mind and body,</p>
<p>or now I realize I&rsquo;m kind of poking fun</p>
<p>at some of the new agey language,</p>
<p>but the reason I poke fun is</p>
<p>not because I don&rsquo;t think it has value,</p>
<p>but it has no specificity.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>I mean, I think I&rsquo;m always in my body.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never fortunately looked across the room</p>
<p>and seen my arm over there or my leg over there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m connected to my body.</p>
<p>There actually is a syndrome</p>
<p>where people feel disconnected from their limbs.</p>
<p>This is a real clinical condition.</p>
<p>These people actually will seek out amputation.</p>
<p>They will try and convince doctors</p>
<p>to amputate certain portions of their body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really terrible thing for people to have.</p>
<p>And it relates to a change in central maps in the brain,</p>
<p>believe it or not.</p>
<p>Most of us want to keep our limbs,</p>
<p>whichever ones we happen to have.</p>
<p>And most of us feel one in mind and body,</p>
<p>so much so that when stress hits,</p>
<p>we feel it in our mind and body.</p>
<p>A lot of stress inoculation,</p>
<p>a lot of managing medium term stress</p>
<p>on the timescale of weeks or maybe even a couple months.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not talking about years of stress.</p>
<p>A lot of that has to do with raising our stress threshold.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about capacity.</p>
<p>And there are very simple tools,</p>
<p>excellent tools that will allow us</p>
<p>to modulate our capacity for stress.</p>
<p>And they look a lot like the tools I just described.</p>
<p>They involve placing oneself deliberately</p>
<p>into a situation where our adrenaline is increased somewhat,</p>
<p>not to the extreme.</p>
<p>And then when we feel flooded with adrenaline,</p>
<p>and normally we would panic,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about cognitively, mentally, emotionally,</p>
<p>calming ourselves and being comfortable</p>
<p>with that response in our body.</p>
<p>So unlike trying to unify the mind and body</p>
<p>and make it all calm or make it all alert,</p>
<p>this is about dissociating mind and body in a healthy way.</p>
<p>And what would this look like?</p>
<p>Well, this is something I actually do as a practice</p>
<p>because I mentioned before, you can use physiological size.</p>
<p>In real time, you can use</p>
<p>the cyclic hyperoxygenation breathing to combat infection</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re feeling kind of run down.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also a way in which you can use things</p>
<p>like cold showers, or if you exercise</p>
<p>and you bring your heart rate up very high,</p>
<p>you kind of go into that high intensity realm</p>
<p>where your heart is beating a little bit harder</p>
<p>than you&rsquo;re comfortable with</p>
<p>or just you feel, some people think it&rsquo;s lactic acid,</p>
<p>no one can agree on this, what the burn is,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s lactic acid or it&rsquo;s buildup of hydrogen</p>
<p>or whatever, I don&rsquo;t want to get into that,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re all familiar with the intense feeling</p>
<p>of your muscles kind of burning</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re working very hard physically.</p>
<p>The key in those moments is to learn to relax the mind</p>
<p>while the body is very activated.</p>
<p>And what that tends to do,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a limited amount of research on this,</p>
<p>but what that tends to do is it tends to create a situation</p>
<p>where what once felt like a lot feels manageable.</p>
<p>Okay, you&rsquo;ve raised your stress threshold</p>
<p>or your stress capacity.</p>
<p>One way that you can do this, and this is kind of fun,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s approved by your physician</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re able to do this,</p>
<p>you can bring your heart rate up.</p>
<p>You could do this through an ice bath,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s your thing, or a cold shower</p>
<p>or cyclic oxygenation breathing,</p>
<p>or you could sprint or you could go hard on the bike,</p>
<p>whatever it is that brings your heart rate up.</p>
<p>And then what you want to do</p>
<p>is you want to actually try and calm the mind</p>
<p>while your body is in this heightened state of activation.</p>
<p>And the best way that I&rsquo;m aware to do that,</p>
<p>again, goes back to physiology, not psychology.</p>
<p>When we are stressed, our pupils dilate.</p>
<p>The effect of that pupil dilation</p>
<p>is to create tunnel vision.</p>
<p>It literally narrows our view of the visual world.</p>
<p>We no longer see in panorama.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some other effects as well,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s because the visual system</p>
<p>through this cranial nerve system that I described before</p>
<p>is tethered and is part of this autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>By deliberately dilating your gaze,</p>
<p>meaning not moving your head and eyes around,</p>
<p>but by deliberately going from tunnel vision</p>
<p>to broader panoramic vision,</p>
<p>literally seeing more of your environment all at once.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to do what I&rsquo;m doing, which is not blinking.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome to blink.</p>
<p>But it means deliberately dilating your gaze</p>
<p>so that you can see yourself in the environment you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>It creates a calming effect on the mind</p>
<p>because it releases a particular circuit in the brainstem</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s associated with alertness, aka stress.</p>
<p>Now, this is very powerful.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re running, for instance,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re at max capacity or close to it,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re kind of hitting like 80, 90% of maximum</p>
<p>on the bike and you dilate your gaze,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll find is the mind can relax</p>
<p>while the body is in full output.</p>
<p>And this relates to work that in various communities,</p>
<p>people are working with this in the sports community,</p>
<p>military communities, et cetera.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a form, not really of stress inoculation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more about raising stress threshold</p>
<p>so that the body is going to continue</p>
<p>to be in a high alertness, high reactivity mode,</p>
<p>high output, but the mind is calm.</p>
<p>And so this isn&rsquo;t about unifying mind and body.</p>
<p>This is actually about using body</p>
<p>to bring up your level of activation,</p>
<p>then dissociating,</p>
<p>not the clinical dissociation kind of disorders,</p>
<p>but dissociating the mental or emotional response</p>
<p>from what&rsquo;s going on in your body.</p>
<p>And over time, so if you do this, you know,</p>
<p>a couple of times, you don&rsquo;t have to do this every workout,</p>
<p>but if you do this every, maybe once a week or so,</p>
<p>you start being comfortable</p>
<p>at these higher activation states.</p>
<p>What once felt overwhelming and like a lot of work</p>
<p>now is manageable.</p>
<p>It feels tolerable.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s for navigating medium term stress.</p>
<p>Now there are other tools as well,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t want to go over 90 minutes</p>
<p>because 90 minutes is one ultradian cycle.</p>
<p>I always try and keep these podcasts</p>
<p>at one ultradian cycle in case you haven&rsquo;t noticed,</p>
<p>so you can derive maximum benefit from them</p>
<p>based on ultradian cycle principles of learning.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want to go into every little bit of this</p>
<p>and I want to make sure we get to emotions,</p>
<p>but I want to emphasize that these medium term stressors</p>
<p>of, oh, there&rsquo;s been a hard month or hard week</p>
<p>or Stanford&rsquo;s on the quarter system,</p>
<p>so 10 weeks or semester,</p>
<p>that becomes more manageable when we train ourselves</p>
<p>to be calm of mind when our body is activated.</p>
<p>And if you haven&rsquo;t noticed,</p>
<p>most of the tools I&rsquo;m describing today</p>
<p>are nothing like the sort of, okay, sit and do meditation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m actively avoiding saying the words NSDR,</p>
<p>non-sleep deep rest.</p>
<p>I talked a lot about those tools</p>
<p>during the months on sleep and neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>And of course they&rsquo;re wonderful</p>
<p>for replenishing your ability to lean into effort,</p>
<p>to learn, to focus.</p>
<p>Please do try and check out NSDR protocols,</p>
<p>see if they&rsquo;re right for you.</p>
<p>The margins for safety I think are enormous.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re basically just listening to a script.</p>
<p>We have links to them in previous captions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked on them on various podcasts before.</p>
<p>We can provide them again,</p>
<p>but today I&rsquo;m really talking about tools</p>
<p>so that you can learn to dance with stress,</p>
<p>to in the short term,</p>
<p>reduce that stress response a little bit</p>
<p>if he feels too uncomfortable.</p>
<p>In the medium term,</p>
<p>to be comfortable at these heightened levels of activation,</p>
<p>because life is going to continue to come at you.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t pick the stressors,</p>
<p>but we need to be able to function</p>
<p>at a higher capacity often.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s long-term stress.</p>
<p>Now, long-term stress is bad.</p>
<p>You do not want adrenaline up in your system</p>
<p>for a very long time.</p>
<p>In fact, ideally you would have your stress go up</p>
<p>various times throughout the day,</p>
<p>but it would never stay elevated</p>
<p>and it would never prevent you</p>
<p>from getting a good night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>Now that isn&rsquo;t realistic, okay?</p>
<p>I would say for me,</p>
<p>three, four nights out of the month,</p>
<p>no matter what I do,</p>
<p>I take on too much or something happens and life is life</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t get the best night&rsquo;s sleep</p>
<p>that I would like to get.</p>
<p>For many of you, it&rsquo;s 30 nights per month.</p>
<p>For some of you, it&rsquo;s zero nights per month.</p>
<p>And congratulations to you zero nights per month people.</p>
<p>If you are managing your sleep really well every night,</p>
<p>that is fantastic.</p>
<p>You really want to be able to fall asleep at night,</p>
<p>stay asleep for most of the night.</p>
<p>And if you get up, go back to sleep</p>
<p>for as long as you need to in order to feel rested.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I define as a healthy relationship to sleep.</p>
<p>Check out the episodes on sleep</p>
<p>if you want tools to be able to accomplish that.</p>
<p>We can all accomplish that, it can be done.</p>
<p>And there are tools to do it, zero cost tools.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s talk about long-term stress.</p>
<p>Earlier, I talked about how breathing</p>
<p>can modulate heart rate through this loop</p>
<p>that includes the brain</p>
<p>and the parasympathetic nervous system.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I mentioned this</p>
<p>and I want to make sure that I mentioned</p>
<p>that breathing controlling heart rate</p>
<p>through the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system</p>
<p>is the basis of what&rsquo;s called HRV, heart rate variability.</p>
<p>And we know that heart rate variability is good.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want your heart rate chronically elevated</p>
<p>or chronically low.</p>
<p>A lot of people think,</p>
<p>oh, I want a really nice low heart rate.</p>
<p>And indeed, if you&rsquo;re in shape,</p>
<p>the stroke volume of your heart will be greater</p>
<p>and you can have a nice, slow heart rate.</p>
<p>Years ago when I was running regularly,</p>
<p>I think my heart rate was down to like 50 or 60</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great, but, and now it&rsquo;s higher than that</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m running a little bit less,</p>
<p>but everyone needs to determine what&rsquo;s right for them.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t really want your heart rate</p>
<p>to be chronically low or chronically high.</p>
<p>Both are bad.</p>
<p>We know that chronic stress, elevated stress,</p>
<p>and especially in the so-called type A personalities</p>
<p>creates heart disease,</p>
<p>leading killer for in most every country,</p>
<p>but in particular in the US.</p>
<p>Because of the way that adrenaline impacts</p>
<p>those blood vessels are constricting and some</p>
<p>and dilating others,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just that kind of hypertension,</p>
<p>chronic hypertension is just bad.</p>
<p>And so chronic stress truly is bad.</p>
<p>I want to really make that clear</p>
<p>because I emphasized a lot of what some of the positive</p>
<p>effects of stress,</p>
<p>but you want to be able to tamp down your stress</p>
<p>in real time.</p>
<p>You also want to be able to modulate your stress</p>
<p>and your emotional relationship to stress in the body</p>
<p>in the medium term.</p>
<p>But by no means do you want to be stressed out</p>
<p>all the time chronically for months and months and months</p>
<p>and years on end.</p>
<p>The best tools,</p>
<p>the best mechanisms that we know to modulate</p>
<p>long-term stress might surprise you a little bit.</p>
<p>First of all,</p>
<p>there are going to be the things that don&rsquo;t surprise you,</p>
<p>which is everyone knows getting regular exercise,</p>
<p>getting good sleep,</p>
<p>using real-time tools to try and tamp down the stress</p>
<p>response, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all going to be really useful.</p>
<p>The data really point to the fact that social connection</p>
<p>and certain types of social connection in particular</p>
<p>are what are going to mitigate or reduce long-term stress.</p>
<p>And this is a particularly important issue nowadays</p>
<p>where we have all these proxies or surrogates</p>
<p>for social connection.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re online and texting with people a lot.</p>
<p>So we can feel connected.</p>
<p>You know, people are like the plane&rsquo;s about to take off</p>
<p>and everyone&rsquo;s texting each other, you know,</p>
<p>whether or not they have fear of flying or not,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, okay, you know, see you, love you, hate you,</p>
<p>whatever it is that they&rsquo;re trying to communicate to people.</p>
<p>Then, you know, plane lands, everyone phones out,</p>
<p>see you, love you, hate you.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope it&rsquo;s fewer hate you&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But everyone has this kind of need to stay connected</p>
<p>to one another.</p>
<p>Humans are incredibly social creatures.</p>
<p>Now there is a way to look at this whole business</p>
<p>of social connection,</p>
<p>not from just the kind of wishy-washy new agey perspective.</p>
<p>And I want to point out that sometimes</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say wishy-washy new agey.</p>
<p>I have nothing against that.</p>
<p>I just, my goal here is always to put scientific data</p>
<p>and some neurochemistry on things</p>
<p>so that for those of you that are into</p>
<p>wishy-washy new agey stuff,</p>
<p>you also can arm yourself with some arguments</p>
<p>for those of you, the members of your family</p>
<p>and your life that maybe aren&rsquo;t so tuned</p>
<p>into the typical language around those practices.</p>
<p>Like, oh, connection is really key.</p>
<p>We all get oxytocin.</p>
<p>Actually, did you know that connection</p>
<p>between individuals rarely causes the release of oxytocin?</p>
<p>Oxytocin is released in very particular circumstances</p>
<p>like post-orgasm, baby and mother, milk let down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s associated with kind of really intense</p>
<p>kinds of pair bonding things of mother and child.</p>
<p>Also father and child, but especially mother and child</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s relationship to the lactation system.</p>
<p>Couples post-sex, these kinds of things</p>
<p>that reflect deep kind of layers of our biology.</p>
<p>And oxytocin is not just released when we, you know,</p>
<p>walk in and, you know, pat the dog on the head</p>
<p>or we see somebody and we give them a hug</p>
<p>and, hey, great to see you, you know, fist bump.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a situation for oxytocin.</p>
<p>The way to think about social connection</p>
<p>and how it can mitigate</p>
<p>some of the long-term effects of stress</p>
<p>is really through the systems of neuromodulation</p>
<p>like serotonin and through blocking certain things</p>
<p>that are really bad for us when we feel socially isolated,</p>
<p>things like tachykinins.</p>
<p>So let me explain what these are.</p>
<p>Serotonin, again, is a neuromodulator.</p>
<p>Neuromodulators are a little bit like playlists in the brain.</p>
<p>They tend to amplify or bias the likelihood</p>
<p>that certain brain circuits and body circuits</p>
<p>are going to be activated and that others will not.</p>
<p>Serotonin generally, and I realize</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speaking very generally here,</p>
<p>but it generally gives us feelings of wellbeing</p>
<p>at very high levels.</p>
<p>It makes us feel blissed and it tends to make us feel</p>
<p>like we have enough in our immediate environment.</p>
<p>This is why some of the side effects of antidepressants</p>
<p>that elevate serotonin and actually can help a lot of people</p>
<p>with depressive symptoms,</p>
<p>but the side effects associated with drugs</p>
<p>that increase serotonin tend to be reduced affect.</p>
<p>They tend to kind of blunt affect</p>
<p>or make people feel like their libido is lower.</p>
<p>The desire goes down because the body</p>
<p>has so much serotonin and the brain has so much serotonin</p>
<p>that one feels like they have enough.</p>
<p>But serotonin, pharmacology aside,</p>
<p>or taking antidepressants aside,</p>
<p>a topic for another time,</p>
<p>serotonin tends to make us feel good.</p>
<p>When we see somebody that we recognize and trust,</p>
<p>serotonin is released in the brain.</p>
<p>And that has certain positive effects on the immune system</p>
<p>and on other systems of neural repair and synapses</p>
<p>and things that really reinforce connections in the brain</p>
<p>and prevent that long-term withering of connections.</p>
<p>So serotonin is tied to social connection.</p>
<p>Now, social connection can take many forms.</p>
<p>As many of you know, I am very attached to my dog.</p>
<p>I hope he&rsquo;s attached to me.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s asleep most of the time, so I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And even if he was awake,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know what I would ask him,</p>
<p>but he seems more or less to be attached to me as well.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no scientific evidence</p>
<p>that it has to be human-human attachment.</p>
<p>I do have attachments to humans as well,</p>
<p>but you can have attachments to other people.</p>
<p>Some of those can be romantic attachments.</p>
<p>Those could be familial attachments</p>
<p>that are non-romantic, friendship, pets,</p>
<p>even attachments to things that just delight us.</p>
<p>One of the things that really can mitigate</p>
<p>against the long-term negative effects</p>
<p>of chronic long-term stress isn&rsquo;t just having fun.</p>
<p>We hear all this stuff, you need to play and have fun.</p>
<p>That can be a little bit of a tough concept,</p>
<p>especially for the hard driving people</p>
<p>or people that are stressed.</p>
<p>But having a sense of delight,</p>
<p>a sense of really enjoying something that you see</p>
<p>and engage in, witness, or participate in,</p>
<p>that is associated with the serotonin system.</p>
<p>And certainly play is one of those things,</p>
<p>social connection of various forms.</p>
<p>Those are things to invest in.</p>
<p>Some people might say, well, you know,</p>
<p>nobody wants to be my friend</p>
<p>or nobody wants to engage socially anymore.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be the first to admit,</p>
<p>social connection and friendship</p>
<p>and relationships of all kinds to animals or humans</p>
<p>or inanimate objects takes work.</p>
<p>It takes investment.</p>
<p>It takes time in not needing everything</p>
<p>to be exactly the way you want it to be.</p>
<p>I have a friend who struggles with this</p>
<p>and oftentimes the conversations just circle back</p>
<p>to the fact that when you want social connection,</p>
<p>you often have to be more flexible.</p>
<p>You have to eat on other people&rsquo;s schedules.</p>
<p>Sometimes you have to eat things</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t necessarily want to eat the most in that moment</p>
<p>or stay up a little later or wake up a little earlier.</p>
<p>Social connection is something that we work for,</p>
<p>but it is incredibly powerful.</p>
<p>I want to, of course, tip my hat to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only appropriate to call him the great Robert Sapolsky,</p>
<p>my colleague who I&rsquo;m fortunate to know at Stanford,</p>
<p>of course, has talked about this quite a lot.</p>
<p>So I want to acknowledge Robert&rsquo;s incredible work</p>
<p>and discussions around this.</p>
<p>You can look up those materials online</p>
<p>and his wonderful books.</p>
<p>But primates, and we are primates, we&rsquo;re social species.</p>
<p>And as Robert has said many times before,</p>
<p>never before in any primate history,</p>
<p>but in particular in human history,</p>
<p>have we interacted with so many strangers at a distance</p>
<p>when we are not really connected to them.</p>
<p>So finding just a few people, even one,</p>
<p>or an animal or something that you delight in,</p>
<p>believe it or not, has very positive effects</p>
<p>on mitigating this long-term stress,</p>
<p>on improving various aspects of our life</p>
<p>as it relates to stress and emotionality.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the social connection part.</p>
<p>The other thing is that social isolation</p>
<p>that goes too long is associated in everything from flies,</p>
<p>believe it or not, to mice and humans</p>
<p>with this molecule tachykinin.</p>
<p>Tachykinin is a molecule that makes us more fearful,</p>
<p>paranoid, and impairs our immune system.</p>
<p>And so tachykinin is like this internal punishment signal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like our body and our brain telling us</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not spending enough time</p>
<p>with people that you really trust.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not spending time doing things that you really enjoy.</p>
<p>And I often think about tachykinin for myself</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m pretty hard driving.</p>
<p>I have a lot of pursuits.</p>
<p>I also have a lot of wonderful people</p>
<p>and an incredibly wonderful bulldog in my life.</p>
<p>But there are times when I can be so goal-directed</p>
<p>and so in motion and trying to accomplish everything</p>
<p>that I sometimes forget about tachykinin.</p>
<p>And I like to remind myself so much</p>
<p>so that I actually have a little post-it above my desk</p>
<p>that says tachykinin to remind me</p>
<p>that tachykinin is this very sinister molecule</p>
<p>that starts being secreted</p>
<p>when we are not socially connected enough.</p>
<p>And this is why long meals with friends or family,</p>
<p>where there are, we&rsquo;ll talk about phones in a moment,</p>
<p>but where there&rsquo;s no intrusions, or even if there are,</p>
<p>just feeling like we are connected suppresses tachykinin.</p>
<p>And tachykinin is something you really want to avoid</p>
<p>because chronic isolation, chronically high tachykinin,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s associated with long-term stress,</p>
<p>really depletes so many good functions of our brain and body</p>
<p>and promote so many bad ones,</p>
<p>including irritability, paranoia, fear, et cetera,</p>
<p>that is really something to avoid.</p>
<p>And so I want to highlight tachykinin</p>
<p>as something to avoid.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to completely disregard oxytocin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that oxytocin has been built up a lot in the media</p>
<p>and really serotonin works on much faster timescales.</p>
<p>Now, how do you know if you&rsquo;re making serotonin?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know in the moment,</p>
<p>but you can learn if you pay attention</p>
<p>to kind of recognize these feelings of comfort,</p>
<p>trust, bliss, delight, and those are not weak terms.</p>
<p>Those are not associated just with psychological terms.</p>
<p>They are every bit as physiological</p>
<p>as the movement of your muscles</p>
<p>or the secretion of adrenaline.</p>
<p>And many people focus now on gratitude.</p>
<p>Gratitude is a little bit subjective,</p>
<p>and here we&rsquo;re moving from some objective</p>
<p>to kind of subjective things,</p>
<p>but recognizing, and in particular,</p>
<p>writing down things that you&rsquo;re thankful for,</p>
<p>however small they may seem,</p>
<p>does seem to have a positive effect</p>
<p>on the serotonin system.</p>
<p>Now, there are a plethora of things</p>
<p>that will also impact wellbeing</p>
<p>and allow you to modulate your long-term stress,</p>
<p>reduce the likelihood that you&rsquo;ll engage in long-term stress.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t have time to go into all of these,</p>
<p>but of course, finding the diet and nutrition</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right for you, the exercise schedule</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right for you, the sleep schedule, all that.</p>
<p>But do not underemphasize the social connection part,</p>
<p>please.</p>
<p>As well, there are some compounds</p>
<p>that are not antidepressants,</p>
<p>although if you need antidepressants</p>
<p>and a clinician prescribes them to you,</p>
<p>please follow their advice if that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s right for you.</p>
<p>There are compounds that are not prescription compounds</p>
<p>that can modulate the stress system.</p>
<p>And sometimes because of the way that life is,</p>
<p>we just don&rsquo;t have the opportunity to control life</p>
<p>and to control our response to stress.</p>
<p>And at least for myself,</p>
<p>I can only talk about my own experience.</p>
<p>I found it useful in times of chronic stress</p>
<p>to start modulating some of the neurochemistry</p>
<p>related to the stress response in order to help.</p>
<p>Now, if a doctor prescribes you Pregnizone</p>
<p>or prescribes you some other hormone or something,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m talking about now are non-prescription things.</p>
<p>You should check out examine.com, this free website,</p>
<p>which will allow you to put in any supplement</p>
<p>and evaluate that supplement.</p>
<p>They provide links in the so-called human effect matrix</p>
<p>to PubMed.</p>
<p>It tells you the exact subjects they were done in.</p>
<p>It was a post-menopausal women.</p>
<p>Was it kids?</p>
<p>Was it normal adults?</p>
<p>Was it people with autism, et cetera?</p>
<p>Check out that site for any and all supplements</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re considering or taking.</p>
<p>I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>I have no relationship to them.</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s a wonderful site</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s curated all this important information.</p>
<p>But some of these compounds are effective enough,</p>
<p>they can kind of take the edge off.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll use them periodically myself.</p>
<p>And so I just thought I&rsquo;d mention them</p>
<p>since there are a number of you that are interested in them.</p>
<p>The three I want to focus on,</p>
<p>and one that I think you need to be cautious about</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve mentioned before, include ashwagandha,</p>
<p>funny name, but that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>L-theanine or theanine, it&rsquo;s often called, and melatonin.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about melatonin first.</p>
<p>Melatonin I talked about during the month on sleep.</p>
<p>Melatonin is a hormone secreted from the pineal</p>
<p>in direct relationship to how much darkness you are in,</p>
<p>not emotional darkness, but light suppresses melatonin.</p>
<p>Melatonin helps you fall asleep,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t help you stay asleep.</p>
<p>I personally do not recommend supplementing melatonin</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s supplemented typically at very high levels,</p>
<p>you know, one to three milligrams or even more.</p>
<p>That is an outrageously high dose.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s supra-supra physiological</p>
<p>compared to what you normally would make.</p>
<p>It also has a number of potentially negative effects</p>
<p>on the reproductive axis and hormones there.</p>
<p>Some people can take it without problems.</p>
<p>If you like it and that&rsquo;s your thing, fine.</p>
<p>I just want to cue to the fact that there can be issues.</p>
<p>You should check on examine.com, talk to your doctor,</p>
<p>especially in kids because melatonin</p>
<p>suppresses the puberty response in a number of species.</p>
<p>Enough about the negative things in melatonin,</p>
<p>except that people who take too much melatonin chronically,</p>
<p>oftentimes when they&rsquo;re taking it to sleep</p>
<p>or for whatever reason,</p>
<p>yes, it can reduce anxiety and stress,</p>
<p>but it also can reduce the output of the adrenals</p>
<p>to the point where it can become problematic.</p>
<p>Now, a note about adrenal burnout.</p>
<p>There is actually no such thing as adrenal burnout</p>
<p>under normal conditions.</p>
<p>The adrenals have enough adrenaline</p>
<p>to support 200 years of stress, for better or for worse.</p>
<p>The concept of adrenal burnout has origins</p>
<p>in the work of Nobel prize winner, Hans Selye,</p>
<p>who actually discovered</p>
<p>what he called the general adaptation syndrome.</p>
<p>He discovered a lot of things about stress.</p>
<p>He did some phenomenal work that turned out to be true,</p>
<p>that we have stressors, there&rsquo;s something called distress.</p>
<p>He talked about eustress, which is positive stress.</p>
<p>Eustress has never really caught on</p>
<p>in the kind of more general discussion,</p>
<p>but he had this theory that if stress went on long enough</p>
<p>that you would eventually reach a phase called exhaustion.</p>
<p>And that turned out to be wrong.</p>
<p>Although many of you may feel exhausted after chronic stress,</p>
<p>there isn&rsquo;t really a physiological exhaustion that happens.</p>
<p>And that eventually got picked up</p>
<p>and ran with the general public.</p>
<p>And they talk about adrenal burnout,</p>
<p>too much coffee, adrenal burnout.</p>
<p>You hear all this stuff.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as adrenal burnout.</p>
<p>The adrenals don&rsquo;t burn out.</p>
<p>There is something, however,</p>
<p>called adrenal insufficiency syndrome,</p>
<p>which is a real physiological problem</p>
<p>where some people have very impaired adrenals</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t produce adrenaline.</p>
<p>And melatonin taken at very high levels</p>
<p>for periods of time that are too long</p>
<p>can cause suppression of the cortisol</p>
<p>and epinephrine release from the adrenals</p>
<p>and can create a kind of pseudo</p>
<p>adrenal insufficiency syndrome.</p>
<p>So beware melatonin for that reason.</p>
<p>Please, I&rsquo;m trying,</p>
<p>I alone can&rsquo;t get rid of the phrase adrenal burnout.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to give a hard time</p>
<p>to anyone who feels burnt out or exhausted,</p>
<p>but it is for other reasons.</p>
<p>It is not because the adrenals are burnt out</p>
<p>unless you happen to have adrenal insufficiency syndrome.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not a fan of melatonin for a lot of reasons.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ve mentioned several.</p>
<p>The other is L-theanine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about L-theanine,</p>
<p>which provided it&rsquo;s safe for you,</p>
<p>can be taken 100 milligrams or 200 milligrams</p>
<p>about 30 minutes or 60 minutes before sleep.</p>
<p>It can enhance the transition to sleep</p>
<p>and depth of sleep for many people.</p>
<p>It increases GABA, this inhibitory neurotransmitter</p>
<p>in the brain.</p>
<p>It tends to turn off our forebrain a little bit</p>
<p>or reduce the activity of our kind of thinking systems</p>
<p>and ruminating systems help people fall asleep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for sleep.</p>
<p>But theanine has also been shown</p>
<p>for people that are chronically anxious</p>
<p>or chronically stressed to,</p>
<p>if you look at the studies,</p>
<p>I have a large collection of studies</p>
<p>in front of me right now.</p>
<p>If you want to see those links,</p>
<p>I know if you want those,</p>
<p>go to examine.com, put in theanine.</p>
<p>They linked, for instance,</p>
<p>it is known to significantly increase relaxation.</p>
<p>There are four studies listed there with PubMed links.</p>
<p>It is known to have a minor effect on anxiety,</p>
<p>but eight studies have shown that,</p>
<p>which I think is a fairly large set of studies.</p>
<p>Some of them in great journals.</p>
<p>It also can reduce task completion anxiety.</p>
<p>So anxiety related to task completion,</p>
<p>not good for the procrastinators perhaps,</p>
<p>but for those of you that are chronically stressed,</p>
<p>it can increase attention a little bit,</p>
<p>it can reduce blood pressure a little bit,</p>
<p>improve sleep quality, et cetera.</p>
<p>It definitely has a notable effect on stress,</p>
<p>two studies in particular,</p>
<p>that it can notably reduce the effects of stress.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot there.</p>
<p>It also has effects on insomnia,</p>
<p>on some blood lipid profiles.</p>
<p>And so go to examine.com and check it out.</p>
<p>This is one reason why I supplement theanine for sleep.</p>
<p>But if I&rsquo;m feeling like I&rsquo;ve been under a lot of stress</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not managing my stress very well</p>
<p>with the short-term and medium-term tools</p>
<p>that I talked about earlier,</p>
<p>I might start taking a little bit of theanine,</p>
<p>especially in the late afternoon,</p>
<p>which is when I tend to start to feel</p>
<p>like I haven&rsquo;t gotten enough done</p>
<p>and the day is kind of carrying on.</p>
<p>And so you can blunt the response to stress a little bit,</p>
<p>which is why a lot of companies</p>
<p>are now putting theanine into energy drinks.</p>
<p>I am not a big fan of most energy drinks.</p>
<p>Most of them have taurine,</p>
<p>which I know some of you wrote to me and said,</p>
<p>oh, taurine&rsquo;s great for all these reasons.</p>
<p>Taurine also has effects on the microvasculature</p>
<p>that at least for me were not good.</p>
<p>It caused bursting of microvasculature</p>
<p>in my sclera, in my eyes,</p>
<p>which is why I&rsquo;m not a fan of any energy drink</p>
<p>that has taurine or taurine generally.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just me.</p>
<p>You have to decide for you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the comment section,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be a couple taurinistas out there that will say,</p>
<p>but I love taurine.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Keep the taurine companies in business.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not for me.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like people to know</p>
<p>that it may or may not be for them.</p>
<p>The other supplement that can be very useful is ashwagandha.</p>
<p>Ashwagandha is known to lower anxiety and cortisol.</p>
<p>There is six, there are, excuse me,</p>
<p>six studies that collectively show reductions in cortisol,</p>
<p>which is cortisol is typically associated</p>
<p>with waking up in the morning, which is good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy brief cortisol bump that goes away</p>
<p>provided you&rsquo;re getting your light at the right time of days</p>
<p>at right, correct times of day,</p>
<p>like morning and evening.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t want cortisol chronically elevated.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s associated with all the bad stuff about stress.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very strong effect of ashwagandha.</p>
<p>You can find dosages at examine.com.</p>
<p>They report in across six studies,</p>
<p>14.5 to 27.9 reduction in cortisol</p>
<p>in otherwise healthy, but stressed individuals.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know about kids.</p>
<p>You have to look at what it says on various supplements.</p>
<p>Most things here are being done in adults.</p>
<p>So please check carefully, but this is great.</p>
<p>I mean, the opportunity for me anyway,</p>
<p>to be able to take something</p>
<p>that can help me reduce my cortisol</p>
<p>so that I don&rsquo;t get some of the long-term effects of stress.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not going to take ashwagandha year round.</p>
<p>I would only do this if I was feeling like</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t managing my short and medium-term stress well.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t take it on a regular basis.</p>
<p>I do take it when I&rsquo;m in these times</p>
<p>when things are particularly stressful.</p>
<p>It has, there are five other studies that show</p>
<p>reduced stress.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not cortisol measurements,</p>
<p>but things like fatigue, cognitive impairment, et cetera.</p>
<p>It does lower total cholesterol,</p>
<p>which may or may not be good or bad for you up to 10%.</p>
<p>So some people don&rsquo;t want their cholesterol lowered.</p>
<p>Some people might.</p>
<p>Cholesterol, we&rsquo;ll talk about this in a month on hormones,</p>
<p>but cholesterol is the molecule</p>
<p>from which testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>and cortisol for that matter are synthesized.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t want to get your cholesterol so low,</p>
<p>there are all sorts of negative effects,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t want it too high either.</p>
<p>Mild effects in good clinical studies</p>
<p>on reducing depression,</p>
<p>probably associated with the effects on stress,</p>
<p>and some other things as well.</p>
<p>So ashwagandha is something I use from time to time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of interesting.</p>
<p>L-theanine, I rarely will use those during the daytime,</p>
<p>except under conditions</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m feeling chronically stressed.</p>
<p>So check out the Human Effect Matrix on examine.com.</p>
<p>Again, a phenomenal website.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve sent them a few emails before.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only exchanges I&rsquo;ve ever had with them,</p>
<p>but I just think it&rsquo;s wonderful</p>
<p>that they put together this resource.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we&rsquo;d be stuck mining PubMed.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve collated the papers from PubMed</p>
<p>with links to PubMed.</p>
<p>So terrific resource.</p>
<p>So social connection and some supplementation,</p>
<p>of course, diet, exercise, sleep for long-term stress.</p>
<p>And now we are finally in a position</p>
<p>to talk about what we have set out to do from the beginning,</p>
<p>which is spend the month on emotions.</p>
<p>It was very important that we discuss stress,</p>
<p>and we discuss it in the context</p>
<p>of short, medium, and long-term stress,</p>
<p>that we discuss tools for short-term,</p>
<p>medium-term, and long-term control.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really want to say mitigation of stress.</p>
<p>Stress is going to happen,</p>
<p>but our ability to modulate and control stress</p>
<p>in real time, offline, using tools such as respiration,</p>
<p>using tools such as dilation of gaze,</p>
<p>using tools like social connection, maybe some supplements,</p>
<p>certainly take care of your sleep</p>
<p>and nutrition and exercise.</p>
<p>Again, tons of resources and information</p>
<p>in the sleep episodes.</p>
<p>So you can look there.</p>
<p>We will do a month on hormones, on exercise, et cetera.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s talk about emotions</p>
<p>because in subsequent episodes,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to talk about OCD.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about depression.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about mania.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to be talking about dopamine</p>
<p>and all sorts of things.</p>
<p>But at the core of emotions is this question,</p>
<p>what is an emotion?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s complex.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t a single brain area</p>
<p>for any one of these things that we call emotions.</p>
<p>My framework, and I think the modern science,</p>
<p>both psychology and neuroscience,</p>
<p>is pretty well aligned with what</p>
<p>Lisa Feldman Barrett has talked about.</p>
<p>Now, Lisa&rsquo;s at Northeastern University.</p>
<p>She runs a big lab there.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a world expert in emotions.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s written two books that are really wonderful.</p>
<p>One is, How Emotions Are Made, which was her first book.</p>
<p>The second one is, Seven and a Half Facts About the Brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wonderful book as well.</p>
<p>It came out more recently.</p>
<p>I hosted Lisa on an Instagram Live once.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll get her here on the podcast if we&rsquo;re lucky.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t agree on everything</p>
<p>about the neuroscience of emotions,</p>
<p>but I subscribe to most everything</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve heard Lisa say.</p>
<p>In particular, the fact that emotions are context dependent.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a cultural dependence, et cetera.</p>
<p>I look at things mainly through the lens</p>
<p>of physiology and neuroscience</p>
<p>at kind of low level circuitry.</p>
<p>And one way to think about emotions</p>
<p>that I think is consistent,</p>
<p>and I think Lisa would generally approve,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t speak for her,</p>
<p>but I would hope she would generally approve</p>
<p>of this description, is that when our internal state</p>
<p>of stress or calm matches the demands on us</p>
<p>or is mismatched from the demands on us,</p>
<p>we tend to interpret those as good or bad.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example.</p>
<p>If I am feeling very anxious, very stressed inside,</p>
<p>and I have a lot to do, that doesn&rsquo;t feel good,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really no different than if I&rsquo;m very tired</p>
<p>and I have a lot to do because there&rsquo;s this mismatch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not in the right internal state.</p>
<p>My internal state isn&rsquo;t correct, rather,</p>
<p>to meet the demands that are being placed upon me.</p>
<p>So in both cases, whether I&rsquo;m too tired</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m too stressed to do what I need to do,</p>
<p>the valence, meaning the value that I assign to that,</p>
<p>is I don&rsquo;t feel good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a good situation and I don&rsquo;t feel good.</p>
<p>Now, I might call it stressed.</p>
<p>I might call it anxious.</p>
<p>I might call it worried.</p>
<p>Might call it a number of things, but it&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>However, when I&rsquo;m tired and I want to fall asleep,</p>
<p>well, then I feel good because that&rsquo;s what the demand is.</p>
<p>I need to go to sleep and I&rsquo;m tired.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m wide awake and I need to fall asleep,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>And then the brain tends to go down the direction</p>
<p>of interpreting the situation as a bad one.</p>
<p>So while the discussion around emotions</p>
<p>is far more nuanced and more elaborate than this,</p>
<p>one way to think about your relationship to emotions</p>
<p>is whether or not your internal state</p>
<p>is matching the demands that are upon you.</p>
<p>So in that way, we don&rsquo;t really place so much value</p>
<p>on whether or not we&rsquo;re feeling alert or sleepy.</p>
<p>We only place value on whether or not that alertness,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s full-blown stress or not,</p>
<p>or our sleepiness, whether or not we&rsquo;re falling asleep</p>
<p>or just a little bit drowsy,</p>
<p>whether or not that matches the conditions that we face.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a useful framework to have,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the reason in part</p>
<p>why I spent this last hour and a half or so</p>
<p>talking about stress and how to control stress.</p>
<p>One reason we did that</p>
<p>is because I think it&rsquo;s a valuable opportunity</p>
<p>to learn some tools and understand stress</p>
<p>and really learn how to take control of stress,</p>
<p>which I think we could all benefit from doing</p>
<p>regardless of age.</p>
<p>The other reason is that when you start to understand</p>
<p>that you have this kind of seesaw system in your body,</p>
<p>this autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>that takes you from alert and calm to stressed</p>
<p>to full-blown panic, it has that capacity,</p>
<p>or from sleepy and drowsy to passing out tired</p>
<p>to, you know, God forbid, let&rsquo;s hope never,</p>
<p>but a coma, right?</p>
<p>That you&rsquo;re basically on this seesaw all the time</p>
<p>and where you are on that seesaw of alertness or calmness</p>
<p>positions you to be in better reaction</p>
<p>to the demands that you face,</p>
<p>whether or not the thing that you face</p>
<p>is a need to fall asleep or to listen quietly and not react.</p>
<p>You now know, for instance,</p>
<p>that if your job is to take feedback,</p>
<p>well, maybe you&rsquo;re going in for a job evaluation</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re in a relationship where you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>there was a call for a discussion</p>
<p>and somebody needs to talk to you about something</p>
<p>and we need to talk about something.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going into there like,</p>
<p>oh, goodness, this is going to be rough.</p>
<p>Learning to reduce that stress response a little bit</p>
<p>so that you are in a position</p>
<p>to hear the information better.</p>
<p>And remember from a previous episode,</p>
<p>if you close your eyes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to actually focus on the information better.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s your permission to not look someone directly</p>
<p>in the eye while they talk to you</p>
<p>if you really want to hear what they have to say.</p>
<p>You will be able to modulate that stress response</p>
<p>and lean into life better.</p>
<p>You will be able to react to things in a more effective way</p>
<p>and to not be reactive.</p>
<p>And this is really one of the important things to me anyway,</p>
<p>is that so much of the language around psychology,</p>
<p>which I think is a wonderful field,</p>
<p>but pop psychology in particular is be responsive,</p>
<p>not reactive.</p>
<p>Well, great, but then how does one do that?</p>
<p>Well, one does that by modulating</p>
<p>their short-term stress response in real time.</p>
<p>Not by saying, hold on, I need to meditate,</p>
<p>hold on, I need a massage</p>
<p>and then I can have this conversation</p>
<p>by modulating the reactivity in real time.</p>
<p>How does one, for instance, be mindful,</p>
<p>which is a beautiful concept, but how are you mindful?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know, when I&rsquo;m moving through my day,</p>
<p>a lot of times I&rsquo;m just trying to get things done.</p>
<p>And as soon as I start monitoring and seeing what I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>and kind of third-personing what I&rsquo;m doing,</p>
<p>it actually takes me out of the effectiveness</p>
<p>and experience of what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>So for me, sometimes that mindfulness,</p>
<p>that observer as they call it,</p>
<p>is something that doesn&rsquo;t help me, it actually hinders me.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s important to me is to be able to work and focus</p>
<p>and then to be able to disengage,</p>
<p>to be able to do a non-sleep depressed</p>
<p>or to be able to still fall asleep</p>
<p>even though I&rsquo;ve been working hard until 9.30</p>
<p>to put my head down at 10 o&rsquo;clock</p>
<p>and be out cold sleeping by 10.02.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s possible if you can learn</p>
<p>to control this stress response.</p>
<p>And to do that, we can&rsquo;t use the mind to control the mind,</p>
<p>we need tools.</p>
<p>And so a lot of the people being grumpy</p>
<p>or anxious or depressed, a lot of that,</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s not for some underlying neurochemical reason</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s chronic, a lot of that comes from being poorly rested</p>
<p>from overworked, from feeling like the world</p>
<p>is bearing down on us.</p>
<p>And so rather than take a subjective view of this,</p>
<p>I take the view of objective physiology.</p>
<p>What can we do that&rsquo;s anchored to these neuronal systems</p>
<p>in our body, in our brain, in our eyes,</p>
<p>in our diaphragm, et cetera,</p>
<p>and look to those as tools,</p>
<p>levers that we can pull on and push</p>
<p>and maneuver through life in a way</p>
<p>where we start to feel like we have some agency,</p>
<p>we actually have some real control</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re controlling the internal landscape.</p>
<p>So I think that ought to set the stage</p>
<p>for where we&rsquo;re headed next,</p>
<p>which is to talk about all the things</p>
<p>that you normally think of when you think of emotions,</p>
<p>like happiness, like awe, like joy.</p>
<p>And we will get into some of that,</p>
<p>but all of that rests firmly on the foundation</p>
<p>of this thing we call the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>this stress modulation, this calming modulation system.</p>
<p>And again, whether or not you&rsquo;re activated or you&rsquo;re calm</p>
<p>is not good or bad, it depends on the situation.</p>
<p>Certainly when you want to fall asleep,</p>
<p>being activated isn&rsquo;t good.</p>
<p>When you have work to do, being activated is great.</p>
<p>So I hope today you were able to take</p>
<p>a slightly different view of this thing that we call stress,</p>
<p>not just see it as evil,</p>
<p>but see it as powerful and useful in certain contexts,</p>
<p>great for us in certain contexts,</p>
<p>and problematic in other contexts,</p>
<p>and as well to think about the various tools</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve presented that can allow you to adjust</p>
<p>and modulate your internal levels of alertness or calmness</p>
<p>so that you can lean more effectively into life,</p>
<p>which includes sleep and social connection,</p>
<p>and the work you have to do.</p>
<p>And of course, acknowledges that the events in the world</p>
<p>are beyond our control.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s in our control is how we react to them,</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s commonly said in the wellness</p>
<p>and self-help and psychology world,</p>
<p>but for which there often aren&rsquo;t as many concrete tools</p>
<p>that we can really look to and trust in real time.</p>
<p>And of course, there are other tools out there.</p>
<p>As always, I&rsquo;ll say it, I strive to be accurate,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll never be exhaustive.</p>
<p>I might have exhausted you.</p>
<p>I might&rsquo;ve cured your insomnia with this discussion today,</p>
<p>but in all seriousness,</p>
<p>my goal is to bring you tools and information</p>
<p>so that you can manage better through life.</p>
