<h2 id="transcript">Transcript</h2>
<p>Ôªøeveryone if you can hear me go ahead and
let me know we&rsquo;re going to start in just</p>
<p>about 30 seconds</p>
<p>great okay good so it does work awesome
last webinar I did I didn&rsquo;t put it on</p>
<p>private and we had all sorts of
confusion so today it&rsquo;s going to be a</p>
<p>lot more organized I can see all the
comments over to the right we have 1700</p>
<p>people on this webinar and so we&rsquo;re
going to get started on time we do have</p>
<p>a kind of a guest coming in I&rsquo;ll wait
for her to log on hopefully that will</p>
<p>work but I wanted to use her as a
demonstration of what we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>talk about so in this webinar we are
going to talk about the digestive system</p>
<p>nutrient absorption this is a topic that
needs to be covered first before you get</p>
<p>in anything else potentially because if
you can&rsquo;t digest you can&rsquo;t heal so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very important understand the basics I
want to cover a tremendous amount</p>
<p>information hopefully I&rsquo;ll won&rsquo;t
overload you but if there&rsquo;s anything as</p>
<p>we go through that is confusing stop me
and we&rsquo;ll clarify it but I will give you</p>
<p>some answers to your questions as we go
through this the purpose of food is to</p>
<p>observe to extract nutrients the purpose
of eating is to extract nutrients from</p>
<p>our food and we have two problems
knowing how to get our nutrients and</p>
<p>number two being able to digest the
nutrients so when that occurs we want to</p>
<p>make sure that you understand any type
of indicators or symptoms of the</p>
<p>digestive system and what those mean so
we&rsquo;re going to really talk about the</p>
<p>cause and effect relationship between
what heartburn means GERD means bloating</p>
<p>and all these things so then you can
understand what what it means and what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re deficient in and what is blocking
your nutrients so and there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>questions about leaky gut we&rsquo;ll talk
about that and flat inflammatory</p>
<p>conditions of the bow we&rsquo;ll get into a
lot of things so I just happen to have</p>
<p>my friendly PowerPoint slide so let me
just</p>
<p>let me just pop this in there should
work and it does work awesome</p>
<p>okay so the first thing I want to talk
about it&rsquo;s kind of weird because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>looking at the screen I should be
looking at the video camera at you but</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m always looking down so I&rsquo;m just
trying to look at what I&rsquo;m doing here</p>
<p>okay digestion absorption of nutrients
so there&rsquo;s four main areas that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to talk about we&rsquo;re going to start
about this stop I start at the stomach</p>
<p>level the stomach
basically the simplicity of it it does</p>
<p>several things primarily it helps break
down proteins so that&rsquo;s where most of</p>
<p>the protein is digested it has a unique
function of breaking down collagen yeah</p>
<p>collagen so when you eat meat and it has
those little layers of tendons and</p>
<p>things like that
well collagen is absorbed and broken</p>
<p>down in the stomach if your pH is
between one and three which is very very</p>
<p>very acid but that&rsquo;s normal you need the
pH to be one two three and as we age get</p>
<p>into a 50 60 70 s 80s 90s we lose our
stomach acids and our ability to digest</p>
<p>collagen so you see a lot of people with
all sorts of problems with their joints</p>
<p>ten I mean the ligaments I mean think
about what your body is made out of as</p>
<p>far as college and you have the skin you
have tone of the skin you have um all</p>
<p>the joints connective tissue that holds
everything together you have ligaments</p>
<p>around your bladder and you have the
arteries that are all made of collagen</p>
<p>so the elasticity is controlled by that
so the stomach</p>
<p>due to its strong acids triggers a very
powerful enzyme called pepsin and that</p>
<p>enzyme helps you digest protein it&rsquo;s a
serious seriously powerful enzyme that</p>
<p>helps digest the protein and but it&rsquo;s
only triggered if the pH is between one</p>
<p>and three
so you can see the problem with a lot of</p>
<p>people if they cannot digest proteins um
the biggest symptom would be gas um now</p>
<p>I could see if you eat beans or you need
something like fruit and you could guess</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about that I&rsquo;m talking
about if you have protein meat and you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t digest it you get gas that would
mean you don&rsquo;t have enough acid okay so</p>
<p>the stomach produces acid to break down
proteins it also helps us to absorb</p>
<p>minerals these proteins that are broken
down turn into with what&rsquo;s called amino</p>
<p>acids those are the small building
blocks of protein but if you think about</p>
<p>what Mino acids I mean that pretty much
builds your entire body but I want to</p>
<p>talk mainly about building up certain
hormones and these hormone-like</p>
<p>substances that travel through the
nervous system called neurotransmitters</p>
<p>so in other words those
neurotransmitters are Veronica&rsquo;s here</p>
<p>great hi Veronica so okay so we wanted
so neurotransmitters are basically those</p>
<p>proteins that go through the nervous
system and they&rsquo;re made by the adrenal</p>
<p>gland or made by the brain and I&rsquo;m
talking about specifically um okay just</p>
<p>have tomato okay yes I can hear you
someone says I can&rsquo;t hear you but they</p>
<p>can hear me okay good so
neurotransmitters we have serotonin</p>
<p>serotonin without serotonin guess what
you get depressed you get anxiety think</p>
<p>about how many people are on psych drugs
and they have a lot of digestive</p>
<p>problems there are more nerve endings in
your digestive system there are then</p>
<p>there are in your spinal column so you
have tremendous connection between your</p>
<p>brain and your stomach alright so so we
need a very strong acid to break down</p>
<p>proteins to absorb minerals calcium iron
if you&rsquo;re not absorbing iron you get</p>
<p>anemic and so those are the two big
things that the stomach does it kind of</p>
<p>just incinerates everything
gets the stomach the intestines ready to</p>
<p>do the next level so now here&rsquo;s the
thing there&rsquo;s a myth about the stomach</p>
<p>okay now before I get into this myth I
want to UM talk to Monica can you hear</p>
<p>me Veronica yes I can
okay so um your voice is a little bit</p>
<p>quiet as are you by a mic okay
now Veronica for four years you&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>heartburn and it&rsquo;s been debilitating uh
you started having problems with acid</p>
<p>reflux and then the doctors kept giving
you any assets over and over and they I</p>
<p>think they told you that you had too
much acid right yes exactly yeah</p>
<p>so she had too much acid which that&rsquo;s
the myth right there acid reflux is not</p>
<p>too much acid it&rsquo;s not enough acid and
so um so they told you that and then</p>
<p>what kind of what trigger that was it
stress or did you take antibiotics would</p>
<p>trigger this heartburn um I&rsquo;m gonna say
stress um I&rsquo;ve I do customer service so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been pretty stressful and so most
um I mean I&rsquo;ve noticed that as soon as</p>
<p>some I&rsquo;m stressed I started feeling you
know like I&rsquo;m getting acid so stress and</p>
<p>then just um I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m eating
you know um I probably ate something</p>
<p>that I was not supposed to like
something spicy or something acidic so</p>
<p>collision so you started to go to the
doctor and I started giving any assets</p>
<p>and if this is this went on for four
years right yes okay now um you started</p>
<p>basically losing weight because you
couldn&rsquo;t eat yeah I lost like seven</p>
<p>pounds did you have it huh did you have
any other symptoms</p>
<p>I know you have you had a severe dry
esophagus um was there any other</p>
<p>symptoms like I don&rsquo;t know fatigue
sleeping problems cramps in your your</p>
<p>calf&rsquo;s twitching on your eyelid any of
those um I had one of them was um I was</p>
<p>extremely dizzy every single day I would
wake up dizzy and then um even if I was</p>
<p>just standing up I felt like I was in a
boat um painting on my back like you</p>
<p>know just on my throat and um back being
and back um being on my shoulders and</p>
<p>not being able to sleep cuz my throat
was extremely dried and I would eat</p>
<p>anything and I can barely swallow it
because I can I can feel the food</p>
<p>getting stuck on my esophagus okay so
now that thank you for that introduction</p>
<p>because now I can go into the next part
because what I want to cover is this</p>
<p>right here let me just pop back in here
we&rsquo;ll come back to that is that um you</p>
<p>have break down a protein college and
now you&rsquo;re pretty young so you probably</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t noticed a lot of collagen
breakdown but absorbing absorbing</p>
<p>minerals like electrolytes so if you
don&rsquo;t have electrolytes you could feel</p>
<p>dizzy you can have salt cravings you can
have cramps in your muscles and also</p>
<p>well let me just hold off what I don&rsquo;t
want to jump into that but now check</p>
<p>this out we have a pH scale between 0
and 14 right in the middle 7 is neutral</p>
<p>the higher you go with the numbers the
more your alkaline the lower the acid so</p>
<p>every number whole number you go from 7
to 6 that&rsquo;s by a factor of 10 times so 6</p>
<p>is 10 times more acid than 7 ok so it
kind of compounds alright now here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>interesting thing that I really want to
teach you guys so if you have some paper</p>
<p>and notes just take notes I&rsquo;m kind of
summarizing summarizing all the most</p>
<p>common problems that I run into 25 years
and I&rsquo;m just going to summarize it in</p>
<p>about 40 minutes
get ready so the valve on top of your</p>
<p>stomach that little valve that closes
the acid so let me pop to this this</p>
<p>little valve right here that stops the
acid from going into the soffits is</p>
<p>controlled by your pH that&rsquo;s right
so that valve if that pH goes a little</p>
<p>too alkaline it will not close well if
you ever hear of GERD gastroesophageal</p>
<p>reflux disorder that&rsquo;s basically a valve
that doesn&rsquo;t close so the acid splashes</p>
<p>up into the esophagus so in reality acid
reflux is not enough acid so here they</p>
<p>were giving veronika all this anti-acids
this thing called a proton inhibitor</p>
<p>which basically if you take hydrochloric
acid the HCL the H is a hydrogen ion</p>
<p>well
they block that from being absorbed so</p>
<p>they block the acids so I can imagine
Veronica you probably just kept getting</p>
<p>worse and worse and worse and worse now
as we go down the list we have this</p>
<p>thing right here it&rsquo;s called the release
of bile bi le I want to just spend a</p>
<p>second talking about that bile is the
kind of like the detergent that breaks</p>
<p>down the grease it&rsquo;s the thing to how to
digest fats it helps you absorb healthy</p>
<p>things from fats and when we get into
the gallbladder section we&rsquo;ll cover more</p>
<p>on that but here&rsquo;s the thing you should
know your pH being very acid is the</p>
<p>trigger for bile so guess what
Veronica when you took these any assets</p>
<p>I could imagine your pH probably went up
to about a four five six and you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>release bile and so one of the symptoms
that Veronica had was severe dry mouth I</p>
<p>think its esophagus was it dry eyes too
or just the throat um it was just on my</p>
<p>throat and I can film I mean I would
fill my esophagus extremely dry coz my</p>
<p>food would get stuck yeah and that&rsquo;s a
deficiency of the fat soluble vitamins</p>
<p>anytime you have dry eyes dry skin dry
throats dry mouth that&rsquo;s not dehydration</p>
<p>that is a lack of
oils like fat soluble vitamins</p>
<p>specifically vitamin A so I told you to
consume what did I tell you to eat</p>
<p>um you asked me to eat um butter um
water yes yeah okay Kerry Kerry gold</p>
<p>butter because that it&rsquo;s loaded with
vitamin A um the other things that are</p>
<p>really good was vitamin A our liver
which I know I can&rsquo;t stand it but you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s one thing you can get
your vitamin A the problem with</p>
<p>vegetables even kale has a lot of
vitamin A it&rsquo;s a pre vitamin A so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>only really like 4% of its absorbs so if
you are a vegetarian you&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>in trouble with that unless you can have
maybe some grass-fed ghee which is a</p>
<p>type of butter to get your vitamin A but
vitamin A which we&rsquo;ll get into in the</p>
<p>next section is important in a lot of
lot of things okay so we have the pH</p>
<p>needed being strong to make sure the
valve closes make sure you release bile</p>
<p>and release of those pancreatic enzymes
an enzyme is something that helps you do</p>
<p>the work and breaking down food and
converting it into body tissue so</p>
<p>enzymes either break stuff down or they
build stuff up so they break down your</p>
<p>food and then they build back up the
food into body tissue that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>enzymes do it&rsquo;s like the powerhouse
there they&rsquo;re quite magical because they</p>
<p>seem to they can be recycled but they&rsquo;re
triggered by certain things especially</p>
<p>pH and and hormones okay so we need the
pancreas like like when you have certain</p>
<p>foods in your mouth as soon as you put
in your mouth your pancreas picks up</p>
<p>what food that is and it&rsquo;s automatically
generating a lot of enzymes for you to</p>
<p>break down that food so I mean you hear
you eat meals with carbohydrates</p>
<p>proteins fats fibers your body is
generating enzymes ready so when that</p>
<p>food gets through the stomach it&rsquo;s ready
to break all that down and it has all</p>
<p>the enzymes but if you&rsquo;re eating a lot
of cook foods huh you don&rsquo;t have enzymes</p>
<p>so your pancreas has to work even harder
um people that like eat a lot of cooked</p>
<p>foods like roasted nuts they don&rsquo;t eat
raw enough raw foods especially like the</p>
<p>roasted nuts al
the raw nuts what happens is that their</p>
<p>pancreas starts working harder in it can
enlarge by three times its size and you</p>
<p>can feel like a full sensation and eat
the left ribcage alright the next thing</p>
<p>is the full absorption of minerals
calcium iron all the minerals need to be</p>
<p>in an acid pH so if you&rsquo;re like
everyone&rsquo;s so focused on alkalizing the</p>
<p>body well all they&rsquo;re doing is blocking
the absorption of minerals so guess what</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to notice the first sign
of a calcium deficiency is cramps in</p>
<p>your lower calves yeah okay also the
last function of acid pH is to kill all</p>
<p>potential microbes if these microbes are
not killed in the stomach level they can</p>
<p>enter the rest of intestine and infect
you okay yeah lovely so the myth of acid</p>
<p>reflux indigestion heartburn GERD is a
problem of too much acid no it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually not enough fasted if you look
up acid reflux on Google oh my goodness</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s filled with all types of false
information that you need to handle your</p>
<p>take an antacid get rid of your acid you
know change your foods but they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>looking at the pH even when they do a
test they don&rsquo;t ever take for a pH so I</p>
<p>mean you could check for a pH or you
could simply acidify your body and solve</p>
<p>the problem and not have to even do the
test okay so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s some basic</p>
<p>data on the stomach okay so acid reflux
means too little acid now it ulcer means</p>
<p>too little acid for too long period of
time and then you get a chronic</p>
<p>irritation and it just eats a hole
through your your esophagus or stomach</p>
<p>or even small intestine so that&rsquo;s what
an ulcer and it also could be triggered</p>
<p>by stress as well GERD too little acid
gases too little acid so you think about</p>
<p>this if the stomach is not right absorb
minerals</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t absorb amino acids you can&rsquo;t
absorb b12 yeah a lot of problems</p>
<p>okay what is that one of the root causes
now I want to ask Veronica um did you</p>
<p>ever crave salt uh my exes did because
oh my mouth was extremely dry so I was</p>
<p>just reading um tons of salt but I was
not eating salt thinking maybe that was</p>
<p>gonna irritate my my esophagus yeah
interesting so um so here&rsquo;s the thing um</p>
<p>one of the one of the things that if
you&rsquo;re deficient in salt you can create</p>
<p>a lost you can actually not make your
HDL your hydrochloric acid so low salt</p>
<p>diet scan create an alkaline stomach or
a low stomach acid so what does the</p>
<p>doctors tell you to do avoid salt big
problem especially as you age your body</p>
<p>actually requires at least at minimum a
thousand milligrams of salt a day I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry a thousand milligrams of sodium
but you need chloride as well so that</p>
<p>sodium about say about maybe an eighth
almost 1/4 of a teaspoon of salt that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how much we need of course we have other
minerals that require to balance that</p>
<p>off so that salt is necessary to build
up your hydrochloric acid okay so I want</p>
<p>to answer just a couple little questions
as we go here because I&rsquo;m rattling off</p>
<p>some people are losing me some people
are not okay</p>
<p>well but if you don&rsquo;t have a pancreas
Wow huh then you have to take enzymes on</p>
<p>a regular basis that&rsquo;s a pretty serious
situation because that pancreas is very</p>
<p>very vital so you have to take enzymes
and one of the things that you&rsquo;ll take</p>
<p>is called pancreatic which is a bunch of
pancreatic enzymes that&rsquo;s what you need</p>
<p>to take okay next question Rachel
cooking food too long kills off the</p>
<p>valuable nutrients yes it does Rachel so
when you roast you</p>
<p>you microwave you kill off enzymes
because enzymes are sensitive to heat</p>
<p>how can stomach acid be so strong and
that it&rsquo;s okay for the food I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>I answer that question but it&rsquo;s normal
for your stomach to be extremely acid</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a normal process okay all right
so I answered two questions I can go</p>
<p>back to the webinar okay so what causes
a low salt dial aging anti-acids now in</p>
<p>a college oh my gosh did I have a
problem I had a problem with them let me</p>
<p>just pop me back in here stop screen
sharing okay so I had heartburn so bad</p>
<p>in college I would take the mega packs
of Rolaids just over and over and over</p>
<p>and over I didn&rsquo;t know what to do but I
was taking all the rights to wrong</p>
<p>things and I started getting worse and
worse and worse and worse and worse as</p>
<p>going to the doctor he says take any
acids that I kept getting worse I always</p>
<p>had pain in my stomach little did I know
and that&rsquo;s when my gallbladder problem</p>
<p>started because you need the acid to
trigger the gallbladder or else you</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t release the bile and you start
getting pain right here and I had all</p>
<p>this pain of course I was in
Chiropractic College so I actually had a</p>
<p>million adjustments to my neck and
everyone and their brother tried to get</p>
<p>in there and work on me and adjust me
and just me the right way the wrong way</p>
<p>and it was I was like a human guinea pig
alright someone who has a problem with</p>
<p>sodium causing edema and high blood
pressure okay so here&rsquo;s the thing when</p>
<p>when you have a dimmi edema or you have
too much sodium or whatever high blood</p>
<p>pressure the thing to do is not to
decrease the salt it&rsquo;s to increase the</p>
<p>opposing mineral and that opposing
mineral does anyone know what the</p>
<p>opposing mineral or the counter mineral
to sodium is go ahead and tell me right</p>
<p>now I want to see if anyone get it right</p>
<p>okay you guys are smart
yeah it&rsquo;s potassium potassium is the</p>
<p>mineral that you need to balance out the
sodium so normally we need about 4700</p>
<p>milligrams of potassium every single day
and only a thousand milligrams of sodium</p>
<p>so all you have to do is increase yeah
you guys yes you&rsquo;re sure all you have to</p>
<p>do is increase the potassium and the
sodium will not repeat the fluid comes</p>
<p>out because when you lower sodium you&rsquo;re
going to get dizzy like Veronica and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to feel dizzy because you
need sodium for the adrenals to recharge</p>
<p>those electrolytes are important in
maintaining normal blood glucose why do</p>
<p>you think when you get home at night
when your stress you need a little sweet</p>
<p>and then you little salt and a seat
sweet salt you&rsquo;re trying to get the</p>
<p>sodium and the glucose balanced um so
yeah Cindy says we&rsquo;re going to start</p>
<p>soon oh yeah we already started we
already started the webinar okay so now</p>
<p>the next slide I&rsquo;m going to cover okay
alright we talked about pepsin you need</p>
<p>that to digest collagen very important
oh yeah check this out now the medical</p>
<p>term for a claw hide Rhea that&rsquo;s the
name for low stomach acids a</p>
<p>chlorohydrate you finally look it up
Wikipedia dictionary whatever so I mean</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why they can&rsquo;t just say low
stomach acid so it sounds very</p>
<p>scientific a chloride Rhea we&rsquo;ll check
this out if you look that up one of the</p>
<p>symptoms of a claw Hydra low stomach
acid is gases the gastro esophageal</p>
<p>reflux disease what does that mean it
means one of symptoms is Girt hello it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the cause of GERD it&rsquo;s not the symptom
so I mean and then of course if you look</p>
<p>up GERD as far as a treatment they say
take anti acids it doesn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a big business and
unfortunately a lot of people just they</p>
<p>assume that too much acid they take the
wrong thing so what they need to do is</p>
<p>acidify the body okay and I&rsquo;m getting
two other</p>
<p>dissolution coming up here so there&rsquo;s a
there&rsquo;s a remedy it&rsquo;s called betaine</p>
<p>hydrochloride petain how to chloride is
the natural thing it&rsquo;s made from beets</p>
<p>and that it splits off with the hydrogen
ion and the chlorides and helps you</p>
<p>build stomach acid that&rsquo;s a really good
way to acidify your stomach and then</p>
<p>taking pepsin too at the same time that
will really help acid reflux now with</p>
<p>Veronica it was so bad we had to heal
her stomach with chlorophyll first right</p>
<p>Veronica yes that&rsquo;s correct
so that gave her finally some relief</p>
<p>there for a couple of days so if there&rsquo;s
an also or severe irritation chlorophyll</p>
<p>now wheatgrass juice in water is like
pure chlorophyll you could sip that and</p>
<p>that will soothe and heal that&rsquo;s what I
use for any type of chlorophyll type</p>
<p>things and then the other thing is you
never ever ever ever want to take</p>
<p>calcium with meals so if you&rsquo;re taking
calcium only take it before bed do not</p>
<p>take it with a meal like three times a
day because that will dilute the stomach</p>
<p>acids how do you know if you don&rsquo;t have
enough acid you have heartburn</p>
<p>indigestion gas so these three things
are good solutions for that okay so um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to answer a couple questions
and then go right back to it my dad has</p>
<p>edema I gave him the task of supplements
but his doctor was horrified and warned</p>
<p>him not to take it due to his low
functioning kidneys oh brother okay so</p>
<p>um here&rsquo;s the thing I had a guy come up
to see me from Alabama he was on kidney</p>
<p>dialysis and what we did he wasn&rsquo;t
supposed to take potassium I&rsquo;m like fine</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just get it from the food let&rsquo;s
get it from the food so he started</p>
<p>eating a lot of vegetables and avocados
and he went back home and his port was</p>
<p>dry and I actually have a recording of
the successor output on the website and</p>
<p>he basically he was a veterinarian he no
longer needed that to go to kitty Dallas</p>
<p>and he and potassium was a key thing of
course you don&rsquo;t want to take potassium</p>
<p>if you have kidney disease as a
supplement but you can get it from the</p>
<p>foods and small amounts and start to
build a person up I mean that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>the I mean I don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;re going
to heal these guys with like if their</p>
<p>have kidney disease and there are
medication how what is your options what</p>
<p>are you going to do not eat vegetables
and just go down now I mean that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>problem
okay so apple cider vinegar that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>very good idea to acidify the body I
really think that&rsquo;s a very smart idea</p>
<p>now can we
calcium rich foods with Emil sure that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a problem mainly I&rsquo;m talking about
calcium supplements okay I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>getting pain in my stomach
two hours uh before eating but only when</p>
<p>I consume alkaline foods bingo ding ding
ding you need to acidify your stomach</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll solve that um what if I&rsquo;m
allergic to wheat well first of all you</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t be eating wheat in the first
place so um because wheat is turns into</p>
<p>sugar and it has gluten okay good so I&rsquo;m
going to go back to the seminar here or</p>
<p>the webinar now we&rsquo;re going to get into
my favorite topic called the gall</p>
<p>bladder
okay now I&rsquo;m covering you know the gall</p>
<p>bladder liver are kind of connected they
are connected actually and they work as</p>
<p>a unit but I want to talk about the most
common problems that you&rsquo;re going to run</p>
<p>into so here&rsquo;s the symptoms of the gall
bladder um number one you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>get bloating when you eat now Veronica
did you have any bloating when you ate</p>
<p>lots of blue yeah did you have burping
um burping not so much okay good then</p>
<p>okay so burping bloating belching the
need for sweets after a meal like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not satisfied why because you&rsquo;re not
pulling in the fat</p>
<p>to satisfy the brain constipation why
because the bile lubricates the colon</p>
<p>see the gallbladder is a sac that hangs
underneath your liver and it stores bile</p>
<p>bile is made by the liver it&rsquo;s stored by
the gallbladder and then every time you</p>
<p>eat the gallbladder squeezes the bile
into the small intestine to help you</p>
<p>break down food mainly fats okay so it
helps you extract nutrients from fats</p>
<p>well other other nutrients and fats yes
essential fatty acids those are things</p>
<p>that like in fish oils I mean flax oil
all those really healthy oils that are</p>
<p>anti-inflammatory you also have fat
Seibel vitamins extraction of those but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an ad and K if you&rsquo;re low in vitamin
D could be your gallbladder now right</p>
<p>shoulder pain oh my gosh that&rsquo;s classic
gallbladder sore headaches so anything</p>
<p>on the right side like the jaw headache
on the right side the scapula on the</p>
<p>right side that&rsquo;s all gallbladder and
then the other thing that&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>is low thyroid function did you know
that the thyroid converts t4 to t3</p>
<p>through the gallbladder and liver so
without a good gallbladder you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>convert those hormones and you&rsquo;re going
to have style right symptoms and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>take the thyroid medication you will not
feel any more energetic you won&rsquo;t lose</p>
<p>weight because your thyroid problem is
secondary to a lack of bile Veronica did</p>
<p>you ever have coffee did I ever have
hematite cold feet cold feet cold okay</p>
<p>yes yeah that&rsquo;s probably because your
thyroid is not converting I&rsquo;m sorry your</p>
<p>gallbladder is not converting the
thyroid 80% of the thyroid function is</p>
<p>controlled by the gallbladder and then
deliver and then 20% is controlled by</p>
<p>the kidneys now high cholesterol
cholesterol is broken down by bile so if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have enough file your
cholesterol can go higher but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>other things that can cause high
cholesterol in some of the other</p>
<p>webinars we&rsquo;re going to cover
cholesterol extensively</p>
<p>gall stones gall stones purely our lack
of bile what are the doctors do take out</p>
<p>the gallbladder oh my gosh now you&rsquo;re
really going to get stones in your liver</p>
<p>so the way to dissolve gall stones is to
take some purified bile salts floating</p>
<p>stool floating stool is a symptom of
lack of I&rsquo;ll why because your stool is</p>
<p>filled with fat and fat floats okay so
that&rsquo;s a good indication to know if uh</p>
<p>you need bio
another indication is light-colored</p>
<p>stool and craving for fatty foods um I
don&rsquo;t know about Branca did you ever</p>
<p>crave for deep fried catfish or any type
of fried anything yes ding ding what a</p>
<p>coincidence
um I used to have gallbladder problems</p>
<p>so bad my grandmother before she died
she gave me a not just she gave me um</p>
<p>this recipe for her famous meatloaf um
that was back in college I don&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>meat look like they make it back then so
you actually added white bread to me</p>
<p>love it&rsquo;s crazy and then I didn&rsquo;t I
didn&rsquo;t read the directions fully I just</p>
<p>scanned it and I missed the last little
sentence where she said make sure you</p>
<p>drain all the grease from the pound of
meat loaf well let me tell you what</p>
<p>happened I consumed a pound of meatloaf
with all of the grease soaked up it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>the bread that could you imagine waking
up in the middle of the night to try to</p>
<p>um I mean with this pain in your stomach
I didn&rsquo;t know what it was I thought I</p>
<p>was having heart attack I had no I had I
had the absence of information knowledge</p>
<p>on health back then and that was the
start of my gallbladder problems ok so</p>
<p>let me just see if there&rsquo;s any questions
is it possible to have stones in your</p>
<p>liver
after the gallbladder removed absolutely</p>
<p>because the stones a lot of times are
made by the liver and then they drop</p>
<p>down into the gallbladder
please elaborate on the need for sweets</p>
<p>after meals what that means is that your
body is not satisfying the brain to</p>
<p>balance the blood sugars because your
digestion is faulty what you should do</p>
<p>is take a little purified bile salts and
that will help you absorb more the fat</p>
<p>see fat is what satisfies you stops the
brain stops the hunger if you go on</p>
<p>low-fat diets it can really create a
serious hunger craving problem okay so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see I&rsquo;ve been a ketogenic diet for
over a year but these symptoms still but</p>
<p>these symptoms still persist I fear
taking betaine hydrochloride as I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to be knocked out of ketosis oh wow
guess what p√©tain how to chloride will</p>
<p>not knock you out of ketosis no it&rsquo;s not
a carbohydrate it&rsquo;s not sugar even</p>
<p>though it&rsquo;s made from beets it&rsquo;s not
beets so you can do betaine</p>
<p>hydrochloride all day long it will not
be a problem okay so now the next thing</p>
<p>I want to talk about is itching you just
make sure that um okay it she let me go</p>
<p>back to the screenshare right here okay
Veronica I never asked you this but you</p>
<p>ever have itching in your body yes okay
you had so many symptoms of this gall</p>
<p>bladder we&rsquo;ve been we&rsquo;ve probably been
working on your stomach we should</p>
<p>probably now work on your gall bladder
because the itching is a classic sign of</p>
<p>a gall a gall bladder um basically bile
deficiency now we get to the gall stones</p>
<p>gall stones basically cumin because
you&rsquo;re in a file because bio helps you</p>
<p>break down the stones and then they get
stuck in the duct and they can create a</p>
<p>lot of pain a lot of problems for you
right shoulder pain it can be very</p>
<p>miserable um there&rsquo;s an herb called
stone root that&rsquo;s very very effective</p>
<p>against stones very no side effects it&rsquo;s
wonderful</p>
<p>here are some gall butter symptoms
constipation right shoulder pain</p>
<p>specifically the muscle right if you
could see this</p>
<p>right here I think you can see it yeah
it&rsquo;s the muscle on the right upper trap</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a muscle called the levator
angulas scapular muscles from your neck</p>
<p>to your little scapula right here and
that thing will be like a rope you</p>
<p>massage it it never goes away
that is gallbladder you should be</p>
<p>pressing on the gallbladder now Veronica
I I never asked you this question did</p>
<p>you have you have any um like ropey neck
muscles tight upper back locks that was</p>
<p>one of the biggest issue I have still um
that pain is just um and I&rsquo;ve been going</p>
<p>to get a massages but it&rsquo;s just I get it
a lot yeah because the problem is not in</p>
<p>your upper trap it sends you a cold
letter so you&rsquo;ll get also you get</p>
<p>bloating over the gallbladder and you
get belching those are my images so you</p>
<p>could memorize them so what is bio bio
is a fluid that helps you break down</p>
<p>fats and extract nutrients from the fat
that you eat there are healthy types of</p>
<p>fats that you should eat but you need
the bile to be able to pull it in so you</p>
<p>know coconut oil
um grass-fed cheese and butter and meats</p>
<p>and eggs they&rsquo;re all healthy fats yolk
it&rsquo;s very healthy</p>
<p>um but if you have a bile you&rsquo;ll get
deficiencies of certain nutrients okay</p>
<p>so the bile helps to extract the healthy
fats to pull up the essential fatty</p>
<p>acids and also to help you extract the
fat soluble vitamins and that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>what I want to spend a little time on
because this right here is so common yet</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not a lot of information out
there correct information so what is a</p>
<p>fat soluble vitamin it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a vitamin
that gets stored in your body in your</p>
<p>fat cells so you can retain it a lot
longer and vitamin A for example here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a symptom you get poor vision especially
at night</p>
<p>dry skin acne why do you think they use
accutane that&rsquo;s a synthetic vitamin A</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very toxic this has a lot of
side effects um sinusitis because</p>
<p>vitamin-a works to heal all the inner
skin of the sinuses of the throat of the</p>
<p>bronchial tissue the inner skin and on
the eye as well and the outer skin so</p>
<p>anything wrong with the inner and outer
skin is a vitamin A deficiency but you</p>
<p>know what it could be just you just
don&rsquo;t have the bottle</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s vitamin A vitamin d3 check
this out bone pain loss of bone</p>
<p>depression especially seasonal asthma
kids that go outside in the Sun to get</p>
<p>vitamin D miraculously get rid of their
asthma symptoms interesting if I had</p>
<p>asthma I would take high levels of
vitamin D and k2</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll get into that in a second vitamin
D is also helping with calcium</p>
<p>metabolism and that vitamin D helps
increase the absorption of calcium by 20</p>
<p>times in the intestine so without a
minute you don&rsquo;t really absorb calcium</p>
<p>okay vitamin E vitamin E is pretty much
sleek muscle cramp vitamin and that</p>
<p>includes not just your muscles but your
heart people that have angina if they</p>
<p>took a good whole food vitamin E complex
it&rsquo;s like taking nitroglycerin it helps</p>
<p>helps chest pain and angina that&rsquo;s chest
pain or the heart cramps if you think</p>
<p>about um
what causes a vitamin E deficiency is by</p>
<p>consuming a lot of refined wheat or
grains as in bread pasta cereal crackers</p>
<p>viscous waffles pancakes muffin sodas
not so does not a wheat but you know I</p>
<p>mean so if you if you were taking like
calcium magnesium potassium and you</p>
<p>still have muscle cramps take vitamin a
that will get rid of it if you go into</p>
<p>high altitude mountain climbing if you
look at the peak of every mountain top</p>
<p>you will see empty bottles of vitamin E
why because it increases oxygen</p>
<p>saturation of the heart muscle and that
the brain and the oxygen they and the</p>
<p>blood so it&rsquo;s really important
in increasing oxygen-carrying capacity</p>
<p>also the sex hormones women that men go
through menopause a lot of times they</p>
<p>lose the libido because the pituitary is
where you store all the vitamin E so if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re have you suddenly don&rsquo;t need the
ovaries anymore and they stopped working</p>
<p>then the pituitary doesn&rsquo;t have to work
as hard and you dry up your vitamin E</p>
<p>Reserve that&rsquo;s are supposed to build up
those hormones and so you therefore can</p>
<p>have like no libido that&rsquo;s about any
deficiency I mean it can be other things</p>
<p>too but that&rsquo;s one now vitamin k2 people
know I&rsquo;m sorry vitamin k1 people know</p>
<p>that is like clotting and they&rsquo;re
concerned because they don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>take vitamin K because they don&rsquo;t want
to get a stroke well guess what by the</p>
<p>min k has about eight different
categories or proteins that it uses to</p>
<p>help balance clotting and thinning of
the blood so it&rsquo;s not just for clotting</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a medication committin which is
rat poison that helps block vitamin K</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t consume vegetables well
the problem is that you need vitamin K</p>
<p>to help regulate the consistency so
again I&rsquo;m not going to go down that road</p>
<p>right now because I don&rsquo;t want to get in
trouble but I&rsquo;m just telling you if you</p>
<p>are put on coumadin you better do your
research and then decide for yourself</p>
<p>but I want to talk about this vitamin k2
k2 this is kind of a new thing for</p>
<p>people but vitamin k2 is probably will
be the one of most important vitamins in</p>
<p>the next five years if people start
learning about and start taking why</p>
<p>because it controls calcium it controls
and regulates the soft tissue calcium it</p>
<p>transports the calcium from the wrong
place in the arteries in the brain and</p>
<p>the joints and it puts it into the bone
vitamin k2 will make your arteries</p>
<p>elastic I&rsquo;ll come back to that in a
little bit</p>
<p>so here&rsquo;s vitamin A acne dry skin sinus
can&rsquo;t see in the dark</p>
<p>vitamin D own pain depression asthma
osteoporosis or osteopenia vitamin E</p>
<p>deficiency heart cramps cramps in your
calves and low oxygen so you run out of</p>
<p>gas real fast if you&rsquo;re exercising so
you have low recovery vitamin k2 I want</p>
<p>to spend a little more time on this
there&rsquo;s a great website it&rsquo;s called bite</p>
<p>it it&rsquo;s called vitamin k2 org has a lot
of research that you can go into when</p>
<p>your spare time learn about k2 in the
research on elasticity if you have these</p>
<p>Spurs in your joints like I do from
trauma injuries and accidents falling</p>
<p>off my bike ins and on the cement having
surgeries for my arms and all that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have a lot of spurring
and you&rsquo;re gonna have a lot of arthritis</p>
<p>and a little type of calcium deposit so
guess what will help that k2 and the</p>
<p>combination of III and K two together
and what k2 will do is it prevents bone</p>
<p>spurs it prevents bunions why do you
think people get this these bunions</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like a calcium deposit on your
big toe there&rsquo;s also a condition called</p>
<p>stenosis that&rsquo;s when the spinal column
is suddenly gets smaller well guess what</p>
<p>that is that&rsquo;s calcium plugging up the
spinal column so you have kidney stones</p>
<p>gall stones plaquing in the arteries
stiffness in the joints arthritis</p>
<p>bursitis tendinitis all that is a lack
of vitamin k2 if you don&rsquo;t have vitamin</p>
<p>k2 you body basically turns into a stone</p>
<p>let me get more into that there&rsquo;s a a
way better test for heart risk</p>
<p>then kallab didn&rsquo;t cholesterol 50% of
all people who have heart attacks have</p>
<p>normal cholesterol it&rsquo;s really the
calcium buildup on the arteries that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why the arteries become stiff and then
you will have a problem with high blood</p>
<p>pressure and then eventually a stroke
but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a test that can be done called
the coronary artery calcium scoring and</p>
<p>you do this test and they can look
inside and see if your arteries are</p>
<p>calcified so this is a way better
predictor of heart attacks than</p>
<p>cholesterol a lot of the doctors don&rsquo;t
want to you know they&rsquo;re not really</p>
<p>flexible in their thinking so they&rsquo;re
they&rsquo;re kind of it&rsquo;s going to take a</p>
<p>while before they accept this but I&rsquo;m
not going to wait that long</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s another Time magazine so
we know it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>it says predicting heart attack risks a
calcium test may help and just for some</p>
<p>of you that don&rsquo;t know me have a very
dry sense of humor says right here</p>
<p>researchers looked at 950 patients with
no symptoms of heart disease and found</p>
<p>that patients with the presence of
calcium even with those at low</p>
<p>cholesterol had twice the risk of heart
attacks or stroke and four times the</p>
<p>risk of heart disease because the
calcium is when you take calcium without</p>
<p>the right things without vitamin k2 you
can increase your chance of getting</p>
<p>heart attacks here&rsquo;s another one use
users of calcium supplements had</p>
<p>significantly statistically significant
increase in myocardium risk which is</p>
<p>heart attack amazing well guess me now
let&rsquo;s uh let&rsquo;s see what you guys if you</p>
<p>can get this right um go ahead and
answer this question because I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>rambling on a long time um tell me what
where do you get vitamin k2 what foods</p>
<p>have vitamin k2 I&rsquo;m gonna see if you
guys get this right and as you&rsquo;re typing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to answer some questions can K
to help a aortic stenosis absolutely</p>
<p>check out the website and look into that
era you&rsquo;re going to find that it</p>
<p>absolutely will help that is k2 bad when
your arteries are already too elastic</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s not going to make it worse okay
you need to take board much more vitamin</p>
<p>A but reluctant to try carrot juice well
I wouldn&rsquo;t get my vitamin A from carrots</p>
<p>I would get my vitamin A
from animal fat I would consume</p>
<p>grass-fed butter things like that okay
so some of you it&rsquo;s kind of a mix some</p>
<p>of you are saying kale there is no K 2
in PL you&rsquo;re thinking of K 1 ok vitamin</p>
<p>K 2 is different in k1 but some of you
had this correct so let&rsquo;s go back and</p>
<p>show you my slide let me find my
powerpoint but okay there it is right</p>
<p>there okay check this out we get it from
grass-fed products okay and see the k1</p>
<p>is in the grass the cows eat the grass
they convert the K 1 into K 2 you may</p>
<p>eat the milk the key for the yogurt the
cheese the beef the eggs from the</p>
<p>chicken who hopefully eat some grass and
then that&rsquo;s how you get it that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>you get K 2 you can have a vegetarian
source through it&rsquo;s called NATO and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the supplement I use so it&rsquo;s a
type of them non GMO fermented soy</p>
<p>product in Japan
it&rsquo;s called NATO and that&rsquo;s what I use</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a version MK 7 which
is a natural version I like it better</p>
<p>than synthetic but the point is that you
get it from the grass-fed animal</p>
<p>products but you might say well I eat
cheese ate milk yeah but you probably</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t realize that most it when you buy
beef or or any type of yogurt or cheese</p>
<p>or butter you have to read the labor has
to say grass-fed because if it&rsquo;s not man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s some soy in corn-fed I just did an
interview of a farmer who is a patient</p>
<p>and he said most the farmers nowadays
plant koi corn and soy and 90% of its</p>
<p>shipped off to the animals so that&rsquo;s
what they get to eat and unfortunately</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all GMO and it really destroys the
digestive system of these animals so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really really bad I wanted to show
you real quick on a lot of the problems</p>
<p>that happen with too much
I&rsquo;ll see em soft-tissue calcium one you</p>
<p>get calcification of the arteries so
you&rsquo;re going to get arrhythmias why do</p>
<p>you think some of the medications they
use for the heart and high blood</p>
<p>pressure are called calcium channel
blockers it&rsquo;s because you have too much</p>
<p>calcium in the heart and therefore you
have to take this drug that pull it up</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not looking at the whole
scene so we have anxiety bone pain</p>
<p>insomnia soft tissue calcium and the
kidneys gallstones arteries eyes well</p>
<p>what do you think cataracts are that&rsquo;s
calcium constipation oh yeah check this</p>
<p>out increase urination yeah it&rsquo;s too
much calcium</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the condition if you want to
know the name of the condition is called</p>
<p>hypercalcemia too much calcium in the
blood and you can get it also by taking</p>
<p>too much vitamin D because vitamin D
will increase in the blood and not</p>
<p>taking vitamin k2 so I always recommend
taking vitamin k2 with vitamin d3 and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be safe cramps asthma bronchial
spasm that chronic cough that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a calcium issue um high blood pressure
but again you have to look at do you not</p>
<p>have enough bile to even digest the fat
soluble vitamins what I&rsquo;m trying to do</p>
<p>is expand your knowledge of the
digestive system the absorption of</p>
<p>nutrients and all the deficiencies that
can occur and then if you have a symptom</p>
<p>you know what it means
gall bladder the causes of gall bladder</p>
<p>issue highest region from heavy periods
giving birth will increase estrogen</p>
<p>birth control pills estrogen therapy
environmental estrogens excessive soy</p>
<p>soy protein isolates and a lot of the
diet things that are there like for</p>
<p>example thick Medifast ideal protein
it&rsquo;s all soy based it&rsquo;s genetically</p>
<p>modified story and even if it&rsquo;s not
generally modified it&rsquo;s still estrogenic</p>
<p>high cortisol that&rsquo;s stress so the
gallbladder um when you get stressed</p>
<p>that can that can mess with the
gallbladder high estrogen and also low</p>
<p>amounts of vegetables and college I
think I never ate a vegetable i</p>
<p>justified I said I&rsquo;ll eat vessels when I
graduate that nine years later I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>eat them I didn&rsquo;t like them and now I
probably more vegetables than any</p>
<p>vegetarians that I know and do I like
them I don&rsquo;t even know if I like them I</p>
<p>eat them because I&rsquo;m such an Abbott now
but I just consume them because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>good for me and they make me feel good
that&rsquo;s why I eat them low fat diets</p>
<p>check this out vegetarians have
gallbladder problems because and I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>saying stopping the deter and I&rsquo;m just
telling you some of the things that if</p>
<p>you do it incorrectly could be a problem
because I think some people do very well</p>
<p>on a vegetarian diet but other people
don&rsquo;t so I&rsquo;m very flexible with what</p>
<p>diet I put someone on but guess what
stimulates the bile release not just the</p>
<p>acid stomach but actual saturated fats I
guess where that comes from animal</p>
<p>products so if you get that other diet
then also your goal butter dries out and</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have enough biome so then you
start getting your skin gets dry and</p>
<p>your vision goes been dry here all sorts
of things</p>
<p>Oh lands of nuts will irritate the
gallbladder two or underman ated nuts</p>
<p>now what you should do if you buy raw
nuts and you soak them in water and</p>
<p>overnight and then rinse them out and
then dry them in maybe a low temperature</p>
<p>in your oven or a dehydrator that&rsquo;s
called germinating and that will</p>
<p>actually help you digest those nuts
because that process helps to get rid of</p>
<p>certain types of things that block
digestion are called enzyme inhibitors I</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s a pain in the butt but um you
know I will guarantee if you don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>that and you eat nuts you probably
notice your right shoulder start hurting</p>
<p>solutions take purified bile salts now
the next question is where does it come</p>
<p>from I knew you can ask that it comes
from an ox called ox bottle but we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not giving you ox bile we&rsquo;re giving you
just two purified salts of the bile and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what your body needs to help
build up your own bow why because bile</p>
<p>is recycled and once you lose it it&rsquo;s
really hard to get it back so the liver</p>
<p>in the gall bladder love vegetables and
they love the kale kale juice kale</p>
<p>blended lg&rsquo;s so why do you think I
recommend kale because it&rsquo;s really good</p>
<p>for the gall bladder in the liver and I
drink it on a regular basis that I feel</p>
<p>really good so that&rsquo;s some simple
solutions for the gall bladder okay so</p>
<p>what I want to do right now is I just
want to see I&rsquo;ll answer some questions</p>
<p>our raw nut butters okay absolutely
those are totally fun how do I feel</p>
<p>about using ox bile I love it I think
it&rsquo;s a really beneficial thing you speak</p>
<p>of is eating vegetarian bad whoever
eating animals in the way that grows</p>
<p>them okay yeah I totally understand that
viewpoint that the animals are treated</p>
<p>terribly and that&rsquo;s a good reason not to
consume them but I found that personally</p>
<p>with my body and a lot of patients if
they don&rsquo;t do animal products their</p>
<p>health suffers so again it&rsquo;s just a
viewpoint what foods are good sources of</p>
<p>vitamin E all of the vegetables peas by
the way are very high in vitamin E if</p>
<p>you have some frozen peas and you eat
those that would be a high in vitamin E</p>
<p>also certain nuts certain seeds that are
not rancid are high in vitamin E what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the maximum level of d3 now realize the
international units come in our</p>
<p>different form so on my vitamin D I use
the 10,000 IU&rsquo;s and you</p>
<p>might say wow that&rsquo;s too much yeah but
it&rsquo;s only it&rsquo;s only like ten milligrams</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that much and I don&rsquo;t know why
they used international units cuz they</p>
<p>make it sound like it&rsquo;s a lot if you
take a forty thousand I use a d3 and</p>
<p>then four hundred units of cake k2
together you will get some serious</p>
<p>improvement in your joints and your
arteries so here&rsquo;s the thing if you have</p>
<p>symptoms of calcium to shoot calcium you
want to take a little bit more like I</p>
<p>take if you don&rsquo;t then you can take a
little less like maybe take one of each</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll get into the dosing and a
little bit can you do a keto without a</p>
<p>gall bladder absolutely you just might
need to take some Sembach for your five</p>
<p>bile salts is epsom salts good for you
well epsom salts is magnesium sulfate</p>
<p>and that will also help with a gall
bladder issue because magnesium does</p>
<p>relax the battle duct but it&rsquo;s only
temporary and so I like the bio um does</p>
<p>low stomach acid affect your double
bowel syndrome yeah because it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be undigested food that&rsquo;s going to
end up in your small intestine so</p>
<p>anything I always like to start with the
stomach and work down what if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a gall bladder then you definitely
need to do bile salts um yeah you want</p>
<p>to check your blood levels of d3 to make
sure it doesn&rsquo;t get out of control but</p>
<p>if you take somehow if you have if your
gall bladder is working in your you</p>
<p>support that and you take K two you can
get away with taking a little bit more</p>
<p>d3 and and you need D three to help help
transport to work with the k2 to</p>
<p>transport the calcium um should can a
cancer patient supplement with calcium</p>
<p>only if they have a deficiency really I
like to get my calcium from food um</p>
<p>certain dairy I like grass-fed cheese I
like grass-fed um I like certain types</p>
<p>of kefir but mainly with cheese that&rsquo;s
how I get it</p>
<p>um I let&rsquo;s see here okay so we trim oil
wonderful for vitamin E and we trim oil</p>
<p>does not have does not contain gluten
okay so um all right now let me just get</p>
<p>back to the slide presentation okay
let&rsquo;s get to the pancreas the pancreas</p>
<p>Wow
I really plan to going 30 minutes so I</p>
<p>have to go a little faster sorry guys I
don&rsquo;t have that much longer ago but the</p>
<p>pancreas is an organ that&rsquo;s underneath
the left ribcage it does two things it</p>
<p>makes all the enzymes to help you digest
but it also helps you balance blood</p>
<p>sugars because it makes insulin so
enzymes are those proteins that</p>
<p>basically transform food into your body
and break down the body into waste it</p>
<p>works with the bile so in other words
bio only breaks down food to a certain</p>
<p>level and then it&rsquo;s the pancreas enzymes
to take it all the way down to the</p>
<p>smallest particle and then so we need
both of those things working together</p>
<p>some of the symptoms from the pancreas
are identical to the gallbladder um</p>
<p>symptoms steadily up that&rsquo;s oily sticky
stool that sticks to the toilet like the</p>
<p>skid marks on the toilet on the bottom
of the toilet that means that you have a</p>
<p>pancreas problem because you&rsquo;re
deficient in the pancreatic enzyme</p>
<p>special specifically lipase or lipase
okay under adjusted food which causes</p>
<p>constipation slugger spells that can be
a symptom you see how you can have like</p>
<p>you really have to look at if you have
one symptom I can&rsquo;t tell you what to</p>
<p>take unless I get the whole picture of
what&rsquo;s going on I have certain</p>
<p>infographics that I&rsquo;ll be putting out
this week to help you guys kind of</p>
<p>organize all these things easily okay
stomach pain bloating irritation gas</p>
<p>similar to the gallbladder similar to
the stomach</p>
<p>pancreatitis you could have that if if
there&rsquo;s a blockage of the duct what do</p>
<p>you do what do you do to kind of prevent
pancreas problems you need us to having</p>
<p>some raw foods I like to have my
vegetables mostly raw when I eat a salad</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do the salad lettuce stuff but I
will always chop up some like red</p>
<p>cabbage in there I&rsquo;ll do some kale um I
will I might do some cauliflower I</p>
<p>always do these additional vegetables
and my salads to really just take it to</p>
<p>the next level I don&rsquo;t go I don&rsquo;t like
have the whole thing like that but I</p>
<p>have probably a good like a good couple
cups avoid sugar okay that will help</p>
<p>your pancreas I guarantee avoiding
roasted nuts germinate your silkier nuts</p>
<p>and seeds because the squirrels bury
their nuts in the in the dirt and then</p>
<p>they eat them after a while that sounds
really weird doesn&rsquo;t it okay so the</p>
<p>enzymes for the pancreas are called pate
pancreatic that would be pancreatic</p>
<p>enzymes that you could take if you had a
pancreas issue okay we&rsquo;re going right to</p>
<p>the colon your colon it has it&rsquo;s like 33
feet of intestine so we have the small</p>
<p>intestine and we have a large intestine
90% of all the digestion occurs in the</p>
<p>small intestine this is where you have a
lot of friendly bacteria that make</p>
<p>enzymes to help you break down a lot of
food so we we have about a hundred</p>
<p>trillion microbes living on an inside
our body ten times the amount that you</p>
<p>have a cells so you only have like ten
thousand ten trillion cells you have a</p>
<p>hundred trillion microbes living on your
body Veronica do you know that only</p>
<p>ninety percent of you has really micro
microbes yeah that&rsquo;s pretty gross isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it so microbes are growing right now all
over you and inside you but guess what</p>
<p>they help you they work with you you
provide a house and they take care</p>
<p>they take the garbage out
and also help make vitamins and they</p>
<p>help your immune system as well um okay
so let&rsquo;s see here function 90% all the</p>
<p>digestion I just talked about that they
help their microbes are mini recyclers</p>
<p>there are garbage disposals when you
don&rsquo;t have enough microbes and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>deficient in the bacteria you get
unfriendly bacteria that that grows too</p>
<p>much and this might be a personal
question</p>
<p>Veronica because there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s only
1,700 people on this webinar but um do</p>
<p>you have any yeast problems yeast
infections um actually I did okay so</p>
<p>what happens toenail yeast chronic
halitosis all this is a deficiency of</p>
<p>the good bacteria and an excess of the
bad bacteria in your gut you have all</p>
<p>the 400 different types of strains you
have from the bacteria from the yeast</p>
<p>friendly mold friendly fungus and that
you need in your body and without these</p>
<p>things especially if you take
antibiotics you are going to get</p>
<p>bloating constipation or diarrhea
bad breath abdominal pain cramps</p>
<p>diarrhea and gas other than that you&rsquo;re
going to be totally fine solution what</p>
<p>is the solution the solution is
probiotics I always like the soil based</p>
<p>organisms microorganisms because the
soil based probiotics are the microbes</p>
<p>that will help kind of deodorize you
like good plant base or I&rsquo;m sorry soil</p>
<p>based organisms which are called
effective microbes they&rsquo;re liquid if you</p>
<p>take them when you wake up in the
morning there&rsquo;s no bad breath even when</p>
<p>you go to the bathroom there&rsquo;s no
there&rsquo;s no bad odor fact we should have</p>
<p>a bottle list in the airports when
before you go in the bathroom because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like every single person with a
digestive problem there so probiotics</p>
<p>are very important and you can even take
these liquid probiotics</p>
<p>spray them on your sewage and it just
cleans everything up so it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>microbes that are in our body that are
in the soil yogurt is a bit too weak to</p>
<p>get your bacteria from but kefir is way
better make sure it&rsquo;s plain and then</p>
<p>fermented foods very very important
fermented foods and that would be like</p>
<p>kief like kefir pickles sauerkraut um
what else</p>
<p>kombucha those are all fermented drinks
those are really good no I know I</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t not been answering some
questions do you recommend the probiotic</p>
<p>yes I will in a second let&rsquo;s see toenail
yeast yeah what happens when you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have enough good bacteria you get
overgrowth of bacteria and fungus that</p>
<p>can grow on the outside your body is toe
on your skin that&rsquo;s what I mean is that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re deficient in the good bacteria um</p>
<p>yes I will have this on replay yes and
let&rsquo;s see here I had my colon cut room a</p>
<p>part of my colon well then you
definitely need to support the digestive</p>
<p>system because if you ever colon
resected you&rsquo;re going to be always</p>
<p>deficient in the surface area which then
you&rsquo;re going to have less microbes</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why we need like a long digestive
tract to be able to get a full digestion</p>
<p>my daughter is having problems with
breakouts with weight I would do vitamin</p>
<p>A and vitamin E but just make sure that
her diet has those fast Laden vitamins</p>
<p>but you might need help with some bile
rashes on the skin well that would be a</p>
<p>vitamin A I would look for the vitamin A
and gallbladder when you actually</p>
<p>support the gallbladder you really help
the skin with so many things because</p>
<p>think about all these these creams that
women buy for their skin they&rsquo;re all fat</p>
<p>Seibel vitamins vitamin E vitamin A oils
the putting on the outside the skin but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not taking from the inside out
if you took like my daughter for example</p>
<p>Veronica I sent you a picture of my
daughter right you</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t really see her skin but her
skin is like an angel skin and that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s because you know she&rsquo;s her
gallbladder is working good and she can</p>
<p>pull these nutrients into the skin and
for women I mean why put it on the</p>
<p>outside when you can take it from the
inside out good let&rsquo;s see if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another question here
okay please explain soil base there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>different types of microbes out there
there&rsquo;s probiotics there&rsquo;s acidophilus</p>
<p>the type of microbes that I always use
recommend and have are called effective</p>
<p>microbes because they can be used in
your garden that can use in your body</p>
<p>and Japan has done a lot of studies over
the last few hundred years on these</p>
<p>microbes and they have these blends that
work synergistically that are for</p>
<p>spraying in gardens and different soils
to be able to convert them from</p>
<p>herbicides to an organic free or an
organic soil because they can eat up the</p>
<p>chemicals so they actually help recycle
chemicals in soil so these microbes the</p>
<p>soil based microbes are doing all the
wonderful things are breaking down</p>
<p>minerals and then helping to plant
absorb it so our soils are filled with</p>
<p>microbes well the same microbes are on
the soil or in our body so there are</p>
<p>microbes that you can take they&rsquo;re not
going to be called soil based because</p>
<p>the FDA is freaked out about that
they&rsquo;re called effective microbes okay</p>
<p>good so now I want to show you so I&rsquo;m
going to show you something let me get</p>
<p>back here yeah so there&rsquo;s been some
questions what do I take for this how do</p>
<p>I take that where do I get this I&rsquo;m
going to give you an option of getting a</p>
<p>little kit that I put together starting
with the gall bladder formula and then</p>
<p>you can just get the gall bladder
formula it&rsquo;s fine but there&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>kit that I&rsquo;m going to show you I
recently upgraded my gall bladder</p>
<p>formula
to made it make it very very complete</p>
<p>because not only did I put the purified
bile salts in oh that&rsquo;s already been in</p>
<p>there but I just recently put the
pancreatic enzymes all it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>pancreatic 4x which has all those
enzymes for the pancreas like it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>ultimate digestive supplement because it
handles the pancreas it handles the</p>
<p>gallbladder it handles the stomach I put
betaine hydrochloride in there and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also stone root in there there&rsquo;s
a Spanish black radish for the liver</p>
<p>it has slippery elm bark to help
lubricate the bile duct so it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>wonderful product that you take more
like a short-term product unless you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a gall bladder you need to
take it long-term but you take it as</p>
<p>needed and I always start out with one
with breakfast and just see how you do</p>
<p>um don&rsquo;t take it on an empty stomach
mmm tea stomach take it with food and</p>
<p>then if it helps you then take one for
lunch and one for dinner you you might</p>
<p>not need it for three meals you might
just need it for the breakfast so start</p>
<p>small work up but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s really a
complete supplement for the gall bladder</p>
<p>but this is a webinar discount that I&rsquo;m
going to give you off this little kit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of a fat soluble vitamin
optimization kit if you want to call it</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s start with the gallbladders
talked about that I have the natural k2</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s several versions of k2 this
is the natural one it&rsquo;s called a mk7 is</p>
<p>from nato
so it&rsquo;s not from animal products so k2</p>
<p>is the one we talked about the calcium
transportation and then we have vitamin</p>
<p>d3 this is 10,000 IU&rsquo;s so what I did is
I have the right ratio so it&rsquo;s always a</p>
<p>one to one ratio between K 2 and D 3 the
only thing I would recommend though if</p>
<p>you have some major major major calcium
problems you may want to take like 2 to</p>
<p>1 like twice as much k2 is d3 so if it&rsquo;s
a mild problem I take take one of these</p>
<p>and one of these in the morning
with either some butter or your</p>
<p>breakfast if you have symptoms like I
don&rsquo;t know high blood pressure</p>
<p>calcium issues stiffness or even have a
stroke I would take 4 K 2 &amp; 4 D 3</p>
<p>personally I take 4 of each in the
morning and you&rsquo;ll find that the it will</p>
<p>help transport the calcium out of the
wrong places then we have the probiotic</p>
<p>this is live probiotic flora and
basically this is the effective microbes</p>
<p>I talked about because I got this from
Japan it&rsquo;s a liquid it doesn&rsquo;t go bad</p>
<p>you keep it outside the frigerator you
take a half a capful before bed and I</p>
<p>like to put it with a little bit of
kefir and slug it before bed and all</p>
<p>night bomb it grows on your digestive
tract and it&rsquo;ll start to build up your</p>
<p>flora that&rsquo;s the friendly bacteria that
is in the in the microbes so I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to also try it I don&rsquo;t know if I can
this works</p>
<p>yeah okay so if you if anyone wanted to
get this they can click this and you</p>
<p>would get the 20% off automatically so
that&rsquo;s just a link that you can click</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s on the shopping cart but if
you&rsquo;re not in the webinar you don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>the discount so you&rsquo;d have to click that
to get it but it&rsquo;s a kid and then we</p>
<p>also if you get the kit I&rsquo;m going to
give you this little bonus which is my</p>
<p>mouse pad which is pretty cool so I&rsquo;m
going to show you I have it right here</p>
<p>this is what it looks like right here
this is your kale mouse pad it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>pretty cool so so anyway if you wanted
to get something if you wanted to get</p>
<p>some fat soluble a whole kit you can get
it or just get it individual if you want</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s on my website but here&rsquo;s the thing
the probiotic that that is something I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t take long term I&rsquo;ll take it for a
couple months and then I won&rsquo;t take it</p>
<p>for a month or two I&rsquo;ll take it for a
couple months and I won&rsquo;t take it</p>
<p>because once you fortify your body with
the microbes</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need it anymore and you know
it&rsquo;s interesting you will just go you</p>
<p>know what I&rsquo;m done I have enough so
almost like your body will tell you the</p>
<p>microbes will tell you I had enough and
if it&rsquo;s really if you have like a lot of</p>
<p>antibiotic stuff you probably take a
whole capsule if you have a little child</p>
<p>maybe take a little half a teaspoon and
just a little bit in the water but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s little white specks on there
that is not a bad thing those are</p>
<p>microbes that are clumped together there
are little colonies so don&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>contaminated so you take half a capful
before bed you can take it in water a</p>
<p>little kefir and it grows the intestine
and then in the morning it&rsquo;ll um like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have people that will take it for
like a week and they&rsquo;ll notice that</p>
<p>their their breath is different they no
longer have chronic halitosis their</p>
<p>energy is better and even their
digestive system down here is better</p>
<p>unfortunately the water now has
antibiotics if you do tap water which I</p>
<p>hopefully you don&rsquo;t do that
and we&rsquo;re just bombarded by chemicals so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a high quality liquid
probiotic um</p>
<p>the d3 is natural and that&rsquo;s in a 10,000
IU&rsquo;s so it&rsquo;s only actually it&rsquo;s only one</p>
<p>milligram okay it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not ten
milligrams it&rsquo;s one of the gram so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not that much and you take the k2 and
then the gallbladder and you can take</p>
<p>them together to start to help absorb it
so that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to recommend</p>
<p>tonight if you have any problems with
the digestive system so as you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>looking at that I&rsquo;m going to continue to
answer some questions here can I call</p>
<p>your office with the code and get it
tomorrow yes of course you can what I</p>
<p>can do is I can i&rsquo;ll send people the
code actually I don&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>see if I can give you the code right now
because let me just see if I can do that</p>
<p>copy let&rsquo;s try that right now chat um
see if I could do this</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that worked yes there is
it there yeah FN 20 does it give you the</p>
<p>actual code yeah isn&rsquo;t it a 20
oh okay so what I&rsquo;m going to do is I</p>
<p>will just create a this is the code
right here alright so let me just do</p>
<p>this here your backspace alright so I&rsquo;m
just gonna show people to code if you</p>
<p>want to write it down screen share
alright so it&rsquo;s F s and K 203 D off so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s Oh F F okay so that&rsquo;s the
code that you can use if there&rsquo;s any</p>
<p>questions you can call my office but
that is the code that you can use all</p>
<p>right um let me see here all right so
all right so now let&rsquo;s see here</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s asking about water the best
water to take would be mineral water</p>
<p>with ionized calcium and magnesium
I like the Pellegrino I like the I like</p>
<p>to read labels and just get me out like
unique waters even if they&rsquo;ll do Fuji</p>
<p>even because it&rsquo;s like a good mineral
water and it&rsquo;s almost sweet to me and so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fun water that I love that&rsquo;s the
best you can also you know filled your</p>
<p>own water and then take electrolytes if
you want I&rsquo;m going to be doing this</p>
<p>seminar different seminars for the next
month every Tuesday on different topics</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why this one is the digestive
system but there will be other seminars</p>
<p>but
I&rsquo;m going to have you sign up for the</p>
<p>additional ones but because you sign up
for this one</p>
<p>you will be able to automatically just
click a button when I send you the link</p>
<p>and it will it&rsquo;ll enter your information
so it&rsquo;ll be a real simple way to sign up</p>
<p>for next Tuesday but I wanted to get
this step out because a lot of</p>
<p>information is based on some new books
that I&rsquo;m writing a book series that I</p>
<p>wanted to you know see how people like
the information see if it can help them</p>
<p>alright says why do I get acid reflux
with apple cider vinegar I try to take</p>
<p>cranberry juice well what happens is
that there is a condition where you have</p>
<p>too much lactic acid that&rsquo;s a waste ask
that comes from the small intestine so</p>
<p>if you have a situation where you do not
do well with fermented like episode of</p>
<p>vinegar and you get like a sour then
what you need is you need to fix the the</p>
<p>waste acid in a lower bottle so that&rsquo;s
what you need the probiotic that I</p>
<p>recommended to take in a liquid form to
start building up the good bacteria that</p>
<p>make lactic acid the good microbes make
acids to help you protect you against</p>
<p>the unfriendly microbes that my
unfriendly microbes can&rsquo;t live in that</p>
<p>acidic environment your intestines
especially the large intestine is very</p>
<p>acidic so you and that&rsquo;s because the
microbes make lactic acid to help you</p>
<p>digest and also to help kill off
microbes so we need that nice balance of</p>
<p>acid and that&rsquo;s why you need sometimes
need to take microbes because it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>start to counter that um so there are
people that don&rsquo;t do well with that and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s because the problem is coming
from the lower bowel do you ship to</p>
<p>Australia yes I do
what about alkaline water absolutely not</p>
<p>only if it&rsquo;s naturally made alkaline
water but the machines I don&rsquo;t recommend</p>
<p>it because I&rsquo;ll check people with a pH
of a nine it&rsquo;s like way way too high of</p>
<p>the urine and that&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re
drinking all this alkaline water um I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if I could show you this this
is a</p>
<p>this is a book I keep these in my office
this is an endocrine book I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>turn to the adrenal right here and you
can see that the adrenal you can see</p>
<p>that causes alkalosis so stress makes
you too alkaline in your blood your</p>
<p>urine might be too acid because you&rsquo;re
losing assets you&rsquo;re losing assets from</p>
<p>your stomach so when you check the year
and you&rsquo;re like highly acidic but you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>really generating an alkaline internal
blood and that&rsquo;s alkalosis and so as</p>
<p>soon as you start doing alkaline water
you start remember we talked about pH</p>
<p>you start destroying the stomach you up
lies the stomach so now you can&rsquo;t pull</p>
<p>the minerals now you don&rsquo;t have the
electrolytes now you feel dizzy now the</p>
<p>adrenals go down it um now you get
cramps and then you can&rsquo;t sleep so if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re feeling very hyped up and you
can&rsquo;t wind out easily it&rsquo;s a like</p>
<p>electrolyte problem what is the symptom
of gallbladder polyps</p>
<p>well polyps are like a mini tumor in
tumors are triggered by things that are</p>
<p>causing anabolic effect and that would
mainly be there&rsquo;s couple hormones are</p>
<p>anabolic one is estrogen number two is
insulin so the most common cause for</p>
<p>polyps is usually an insulin polyp and
that&rsquo;s coming from eating a little too</p>
<p>much sugar if you want to get rid of
polyps just avoid all sugars and read</p>
<p>the labels oh yeah someone asked is does
my probiotic um does it go through the</p>
<p>stomach yes it does none of that none of
those microbes are destroyed at the</p>
<p>stomach level one of the microbes in my
probiotic is called called Pseudomonas</p>
<p>sunomono Paul serious that microbe can
grow in lava isn&rsquo;t that wild it can grow</p>
<p>in lava it doesn&rsquo;t get kill I mean like
it&rsquo;ll survive anything</p>
<p>so there are microbes that live in the
cloud</p>
<p>I mean live in the bottom of the ocean
so it&rsquo;s a very complete there&rsquo;s 400</p>
<p>strains in that probiotic so when you
take it and it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>slowly over time balance out your your
flora at town I mean there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>different effects that will create for
joints for less waste in your gut more</p>
<p>regular bowel movements lubricates the
colon does a lot of things um baking</p>
<p>soda for stomach problems absolutely not
because that&rsquo;s going to alkalize your</p>
<p>stomach and you don&rsquo;t want to take
baking soda it&rsquo;ll give you a little bit</p>
<p>of relief but then it could create a lot
of problems down the road</p>
<p>just like you Veronica when you took the
any assets you probably noticed that you</p>
<p>felt good for a second and then it got
worse is that true yes that&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s completely correct yeah yeah
because just alkalize your stomach you</p>
<p>feel better and then you feel worse and
then you&rsquo;re like oh my gosh my stomach</p>
<p>is killing me right so I just finally
got through all my slides and I want to</p>
<p>know if you guys liked the webinar did
you learn anything oh sorry the ratio of</p>
<p>k2 it&rsquo;s a 1 to 1 ratio K 1 to K 2
okay so how many do you need</p>
<p>personally I take for K 2 in 4 d 3 in
the morning</p>
<p>every single day why because I have a
history of a lot of spurring I&rsquo;m trying</p>
<p>to find my bed my x-rays renhill show
you I have spurring all of my neck back</p>
<p>from injuries from motorcycle accidents
and things like that and but other</p>
<p>people take it maybe further blood
pressure so be four to four if for</p>
<p>example you might have you just want to
prevent issues just take one in one but</p>
<p>the k2 is really good for creating
elasticity into the arteries in the</p>
<p>joints and also if anyone of you take
any of my vitamins or anything you have</p>
<p>a question about
how many I should take you could always</p>
<p>call my office and ask me personally I
will leave a message and tell you what</p>
<p>to take based on your history but I&rsquo;ll
probably need you to give a little</p>
<p>history on what&rsquo;s going on I don&rsquo;t like
the alkaline water machines now I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>honey now you don&rsquo;t want to take honey
because it&rsquo;s basically too many too many</p>
<p>sugars unless you don&rsquo;t want to lose
weight if you don&rsquo;t want to lose weight</p>
<p>a little bit of Tupelo Honey is not a
bad thing</p>
<p>Organic coffee I&rsquo;m not against a small
amount of coffee that&rsquo;s the worst of</p>
<p>your problems it&rsquo;s like if you want to
do that just make sure the cream is</p>
<p>organic and make sure that the the sugar
is xylitol and not regular sugar or if</p>
