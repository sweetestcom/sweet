    <p>Welcome everybody to Episode 101. David Sachs is on vacation sitting in Brad Gershner from Altimeter</p>
<p>Group. Welcome back to the pod. Brad, how you doing? Good to be back. Good to be back. I mean,</p>
<p>first you first you guys, you know, tilted Friedberg and now a little bit on Sachs is</p>
<p>getting attacked on Twitter. And so you roll me back in when Yeah, we got a little problem.</p>
<p>Whenever the Brigadoons come out, Brad Gershner.</p>
<p>I think Sachs will be okay. But shout out to Sachs, you know, who probably hates the term</p>
<p>Brigadoons. The nitwits that are in the Brigadoons. The Brigadoons. It&rsquo;s all going to</p>
<p>end at some point. Because I think the Brigadoons. New ownership at Twitter is going to change like</p>
<p>the whole span. That&rsquo;s a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, right? Brigadoon. Yeah. Yeah. But now I</p>
<p>think Brigadoons could stick. I don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ve never heard anybody use that for the Brigadiers.</p>
<p>Calling the Twitter mob the Brigadoons is a good new thing. I like it. It&rsquo;s pejorative. It&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>It softens everything a little bit tones it down. I like it. It feels goofy. It completely</p>
<p>disempowers them. They really want to be taken seriously. But they&rsquo;re just a Brigadoon.</p>
<p>I mean, to be a Brigadoon, though, you have to have four or more accounts. And you have to reply</p>
<p>to each of those accounts as if it&rsquo;s an actual conversation. So low Brigadoon. Yeah, when you</p>
<p>retweet something as a social justice warrior, as an example, you&rsquo;re trying to join the Brigadoon.</p>
<p>Ah, got it. It&rsquo;s just a different Brigadoon. It&rsquo;s a Brigadoon. Jekyll,</p>
<p>are you&rsquo;re sometimes a Brigadoon, right? You&rsquo;re part of Brigadoons, Jekyll. No,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not part of any Brigadoon. You&rsquo;re totally Brigadoon. Come on. I do not know.</p>
<p>Brigadoon. I never I&rsquo;ve never done. I mean, I may have done once or twice for my burner.</p>
<p>We open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy.</p>
<p>Well, anyway, Kanye West can&rsquo;t leave an amazing career alone, and he is going to buy Parler,</p>
<p>which apparently Candace Owens&rsquo; husband, George Farmer, had created. So he&rsquo;s going to buy his own</p>
<p>social network. If you don&rsquo;t remember, Parler is like a really shitty version of</p>
<p>Twitter that never seems to have worked or been stable. It crashed the first 10 times I used it.</p>
<p>Miraculously, this steaming pile of garbage had raised 56 million in funding.</p>
<p>And Kanye is on a social media slash media tour saying horrific anti-Semitic stuff. He seems to</p>
<p>be having a mental breakdown again. There&rsquo;s a big discussion now, I guess. Should people be</p>
<p>platforming them to the point that he&rsquo;s doing three, four or five hour interviews with people?</p>
<p>And it does seem like it&rsquo;s acute mental illness slash breakdown. I don&rsquo;t want to like,</p>
<p>diagnose anybody from afar here. And I&rsquo;m not qualified.</p>
<p>But you just did.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, he has been public about his struggles with mental illness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a huge leap for any of us that have had family members.</p>
<p>Have manic episodes. I mean, this is clearly a manic.</p>
<p>Pretty much right out of the textbook.</p>
<p>So my question for you guys is what you have somebody with great wealth, great creativity,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s obviously a savant in so many different categories. With a huge social media following</p>
<p>plus money plus fame. And then you add social media to the mix, which is an accelerant. And</p>
<p>then all of these, you know, Tucker Carlson and every other publication, every podcast using this</p>
<p>moment, I think in a way to kind of, I don&rsquo;t know, get ratings off of this trainwreck. I find</p>
<p>it abhorrent to interview somebody when they&rsquo;re in a manic episode like this. I&rsquo;ll be totally</p>
<p>honest, I wouldn&rsquo;t do it. What is your take on this?</p>
<p>I have a family member, a blood relative that is in severe mental health crisis.</p>
<p>If the emails and the text messages that this person sent were public,</p>
<p>you I read these things, and they&rsquo;ve severely, severely impacted me</p>
<p>to the point now where I have like a rule that when they&rsquo;re in a manic episode,</p>
<p>I just kind of harvest them and archive them just in case something bad happens.</p>
<p>But I can&rsquo;t even take the effort to read it and because it takes such a toll. And then I feel</p>
<p>really guilty because I think maybe there&rsquo;s a something in there where I could be missing</p>
<p>something. So this is what when you&rsquo;re in the middle of a of a severe episode, this is what</p>
<p>the family and the loved ones of that person is also dealing with. So I have I have no idea what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening with Kanye. But what I would tell you is, when you&rsquo;re in a manic episode, the more the</p>
<p>thing that you need is for the people around you to try to step in to help you. And it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>freaking hard. And I can tell you that in I&rsquo;ve seen this person in my family say and say things</p>
<p>and do things that are just so beyond the pale. Yeah. And it&rsquo;s part of when they&rsquo;re in that</p>
<p>moment. And the whole goal is to try to get them out, get them back on their meds,</p>
<p>get them rebalanced. It&rsquo;s a really, really complicated thing to deal with.</p>
<p>Well, look, I mean, the guy, the guy&rsquo;s buying a social media platform.</p>
<p>I think it continues to support the point that I&rsquo;ve made a few times, which is I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that anyone has a monopoly in social media networks. We&rsquo;ve seen every couple of years,</p>
<p>competitors emerge, people proclaim monopoly, those monopolies get destroyed by the next thing,</p>
<p>you know, from Friendster to Myspace, to Facebook, to Instagram, to Snapchat, to TikTok.</p>
<p>And I think that the reality is the users of those platforms ultimately coalesce around a set</p>
<p>of standards they want to see happen on that platform. And those standards become kind of</p>
<p>the editorialized or produced model for how that platform should operate. Because that&rsquo;s what the</p>
<p>users say. They don&rsquo;t want anti semitism, they don&rsquo;t want what they would call kind of challenging</p>
<p>an institution, they don&rsquo;t want fake news, whatever the classification is, there is an</p>
<p>editor or an editorial board that editorializes what is and isn&rsquo;t allowed to be said on that</p>
<p>platform. And ultimately, there is a fringe voice or a voice that feels unheard or feels like it</p>
<p>cannot speak on that platform. And what we&rsquo;re seeing now with I think Elon acquiring Twitter</p>
<p>and Kanye acquiring Parler, and generally a number of kind of emerging networks, like what&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>called rumbler as an alternative to YouTube is a really good indication. Maybe what&rsquo;s it called</p>
<p>rumble? I think rumble? Yeah, there&rsquo;s no, I think it&rsquo;s a really clear supporting fact that</p>
<p>there are going to be alternatives. And that these what we thought were monopolies and what</p>
<p>kind of became digital town squares, and almost infrastructure are really just application layers,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re editorialized, and there are going to be competitors. And I think there are folks that want</p>
<p>to have a voice that feel like they&rsquo;ve been editorialized out of the existing networks,</p>
<p>like Kanye, like Trump, like Elon to some degree. And they&rsquo;re, you know, those that have resources</p>
<p>are changing that. And I think that speaks to a really healthy, competitive market. So having</p>
<p>folks like Kanye step in and try and create a new platform that has alternative voices.</p>
<p>Long term, I believe in freedom of speech, I believe that we should have alternative voices.</p>
<p>But I also believe that consumers and customers should be able to choose what platform they want</p>
<p>to be on, based on the editorialization that happens on those platforms. And I do believe</p>
<p>that the owners of those platforms should have their own rules, because it creates a different</p>
<p>differentiated product. Jason, is that what you were hoping to get comment on? Or this idea of</p>
<p>the media frenzy, feeding on Kanye&rsquo;s mental breakdown? Yeah, I was talking about the media</p>
<p>frenzy. That&rsquo;s the thing that I think is pretty important here. In fact, YouTube just pulled a</p>
<p>bunch of the interviews he did recently, because there&rsquo;s so much anti semitic stuff in it. And,</p>
<p>you know, when somebody is in a mental breakdown like this, which I think it&rsquo;s pretty clear he&rsquo;s in,</p>
<p>you know, they do this behavior. And of course, it&rsquo;s hurting them. It&rsquo;s to your point, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s hurting his kids or ex wives, or ex wife. And, you know, can I ask? What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>Can I ask who do you think is to decide that? Because he&rsquo;s done interviews where he said,</p>
<p>I have episodes and those episodes actually provide me with creativity and brilliance.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s up to the person, the person who is the host of that show,</p>
<p>who has to make an editorial decision. And so Tucker Carlson is going for ratings,</p>
<p>where if somebody else does it, and they want the ratings, because Kanye is a big name.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, you know, I get it. He&rsquo;s a he&rsquo;s a great get right. And if you&rsquo;re somebody who likes to</p>
<p>interview people, that&rsquo;s like a lifetime get that could be the get that you know, makes people learn</p>
<p>about your podcast. I just think it&rsquo;s unethical to do that when somebody is suffering like that,</p>
<p>to then feature them and to platform them in order to get your own ratings. That&rsquo;s a personal</p>
<p>decision. I mean, let me ask you a different question, though. So I wouldn&rsquo;t do it. Would you</p>
<p>hold them accountable for what he said? Well, this and this is the nuance, you know,</p>
<p>and I think we do have to think about that because anti semitism exists in the world,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got a big fan base. That means if he&rsquo;s got people in his fan base, who are also having a</p>
<p>manic episode, they could then be inspired by what he&rsquo;s saying to do something horrific and</p>
<p>cause real world harm. And this is where, you know, the accelerant of social media, I think</p>
<p>is particularly dangerous to mouth, you know, in the old days, if somebody said this stuff on a</p>
<p>talk show, maybe they don&rsquo;t air it, where they say it, it&rsquo;s in the newspapers. But when he can</p>
<p>have a continuing dialogue across many podcasts a week, he&rsquo;s done like 10 podcasts in the last week,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll go on air with anybody. And then he has whatever 10s of millions of followers,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s reaching hundreds of millions of people, all you need is one person who&rsquo;s mentally ill,</p>
<p>to then go do some horrible thing in the world that we&rsquo;ve seen happen many times. And that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m concerned about. You have to understand your that it&rsquo;s the law of big numbers. Basically,</p>
<p>tomorrow, there&rsquo;s a large number of people, you know, just to give you a sense of it, you know,</p>
<p>when this family member of mine, you know, we&rsquo;ve had, we&rsquo;ve had to have interventions, we&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>police, we&rsquo;ve had the government get involved in Canada, we had had their driver&rsquo;s license taken</p>
<p>away, then I mean, it is an unbelievably complicated set of interventions. And I am so</p>
<p>thankful that she doesn&rsquo;t have massive social media awareness, because it would just be chaos.</p>
<p>And I would hate that, you know, because of their association to me that this person gets</p>
<p>more attention than they should in a moment where what they really need is help.</p>
<p>And I think that that is should be the governing principle in moments like this,</p>
<p>where if a bunch of your family members or your healthcare providers or whatever,</p>
<p>can raise their hand and say, Hey, hold on a second, this is completely off the rails.</p>
<p>You know, freeberg to your point, I don&rsquo;t think that editorial freedom matters. In that point,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s just a more humane idea around, get this person off the airwaves and like,</p>
<p>allow themselves to get out of get out of that loop.</p>
<p>Settle down.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And and typically, what happens is that, you know, these folks, and again, and just in my experience,</p>
<p>will have titrated a medicine well, and then when that titration fails,</p>
<p>their ability to regulate their emotions fail. And this is the loop that they enter. And,</p>
<p>you know, you really have to find a way of like taking all of these mechanisms off the table,</p>
<p>so that they can re regulate themselves. And I think that as a society, we have to sort of move</p>
<p>towards that so that if, you know, family members can call Twitter or Facebook or Instagram or</p>
<p>whatever, and say, Listen, you&rsquo;re the doctor, you know, here&rsquo;s a here&rsquo;s the doctor&rsquo;s note, like,</p>
<p>you have to be able to shut this stuff down, because you have to mute all of these other</p>
<p>things. So that this person can then get back into a mode where they re regulate,</p>
<p>that should be the priority.</p>
<p>Yeah, compassion for the person. Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not forgiving what they say. But it is having maybe a little bit more</p>
<p>compassion that moment to get them back to their, to their true self.</p>
<p>This one&rsquo;s a little easy to say, Hey, Kanye is having a mental breakdown,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s talked about mental illness in the past, it&rsquo;s a lot harder to make these,</p>
<p>you know, supposed determinations as a reporter or podcast host. If someone says something crazy,</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s easy to raise your hand and say, Hey, they&rsquo;re crazy, cut it out.</p>
<p>Or there&rsquo;s some mental health issue going on here.</p>
<p>But Freeberg, if he&rsquo;s not, if he&rsquo;s not having a mental issue right now,</p>
<p>then he is a horrible human being who is an anti Semite, who is spreading just the most</p>
<p>vitriolic, horrible things you can tropes you could ever imagine, at a time when you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s enough division in the country and somebody could get hurt, you know.</p>
<p>So either in either case, his accounts have to get paused if he&rsquo;s going to say</p>
<p>anti Semitic stuff on them.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the I mean, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s really clear guidelines across all these</p>
<p>platforms on what&rsquo;s inappropriate. And certainly, I think folks will start to adhere to it.</p>
<p>I guess if I had anything to contribute, I mean, I think Chema said this well,</p>
<p>about a mental health angle. But what I would say is, I actually think that the social platforms</p>
<p>have done a reasonably good job. The fact that he&rsquo;s buying parlor, I think, is evidence of the</p>
<p>fact that there actually is an editorial layer. Yeah, that&rsquo;s doing a reasonable job. It&rsquo;s a tough</p>
<p>decision. There&rsquo;s always going to be a long tail a podcast, somebody will, you know, somebody will</p>
<p>go grift off of, you know, an episode or whatever. But I think, you know, a few years ago, we were</p>
<p>talking about no editorial standards. And I think today, you know, across these platforms, obviously,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a tension, there&rsquo;s a tension that&rsquo;s existed for 100 years plus around free speech.</p>
<p>On these platforms, I get that tension. But I think a little credit where credits do we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>seeing, we&rsquo;re not seeing these memes spread like wildfire, in part, because the platforms with the</p>
<p>most reach are doing their job, snaps down 30%. Today, you guys see this, I think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s related</p>
<p>in the sense that everyone historically talked about social networks as being these, you know,</p>
<p>the network effect where, you know, multiple people get on and they link up with you with each</p>
<p>other, it&rsquo;s harder and harder to break the network, and it gets bigger and more valuable</p>
<p>and can generate more revenue. Clearly not happened over the years with Twitter, to the degree that</p>
<p>people thought it should have. And now clearly, it&rsquo;s not happening with snap. I think it also</p>
<p>speaks to this idea of fragmentation. I don&rsquo;t know if you guys want to talk about snap, but</p>
<p>pretty significant decline from, well, here&rsquo;s the 160, they were 160 billion market cap.</p>
<p>And today, they&rsquo;re trading at 12. They&rsquo;re down 91% from peak to track 91%.</p>
<p>Yeah, here&rsquo;s the important thing to note, which is that if you look at the</p>
<p>ma you growth of snap, it&rsquo;s actually been extremely steady. And they&rsquo;ve had an incredible</p>
<p>march forward. And I think that they&rsquo;re roughly around 350 million. Nick, I&rsquo;ll send you the</p>
<p>da yes, right. I&rsquo;ll send you the link. Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s like the Dow is</p>
<p>count is incredible. It&rsquo;s incredible. So it&rsquo;s, yeah, it&rsquo;s a service that is incrementally</p>
<p>every day more relied upon than the day before. And it&rsquo;s a service that&rsquo;s providing a set of</p>
<p>features that is incrementally more important to a larger and larger group of people. So how do you</p>
<p>then square that with its stock performance? And in my opinion, I&rsquo;ll just be really honest</p>
<p>with you. And I don&rsquo;t know, Evan Spiegel, and I&rsquo;ve never trafficked in Snapchat at all, okay.</p>
<p>But it is the most glaring example of corporate misgovernance that has ever happened on the</p>
<p>internet. And the reason is, when you look at what happened in the IPO, it basically created</p>
<p>a governance structure where the common shareholder had all voting power taken away.</p>
<p>So 100% effectively, the de facto voting power stayed with the class that was held by the</p>
<p>founders. And so you you do not have a normal check and balance. And it was egregious. Other</p>
<p>companies would have voting programs where it was 20 to one. And you would sometimes say, Oh,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only should be 10 to one, or it should be 50 to one, this was like 100 to zero.</p>
<p>And what you have now is no real feedback loop, because there is no person who can own enough</p>
<p>equity with enough say, to sit across the table from that CEO and say, here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>seeing. And here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re getting wrong. And I think you&rsquo;re always better off by having those</p>
<p>kinds of people be able to get a meeting with you in the first place, and have a vested interest</p>
<p>where you take them seriously. But how would you receive a meeting? When you&rsquo;re sitting across the</p>
<p>table from somebody in the back of mind, you&rsquo;re like, wow, this person has literally no say in</p>
<p>what I do after this meeting ends, literally none, you can&rsquo;t vote even to even different than alphabet</p>
<p>and meta at 10 to one, because they I think they both have dual class, right? Yeah, Brad.</p>
<p>I think zero is, in my opinion, a deep sign of disrespect.</p>
<p>I think you can, I think you can agree. You know, that there is a separation between, you know, the</p>
<p>voice of the common shareholder in these companies and and the direction of the companies, but I</p>
<p>think it obscures what&rsquo;s going on. Chamath, I totally agree with you. If you look at usage,</p>
<p>the number of customers walking into the store, snaps gone from 265 to 360 million da use Twitter</p>
<p>190 to 240 meta from 1.8 to two over the course of the last three years, they&rsquo;re all growing,</p>
<p>more people are walking into the store and using the service. The story here is all about pricing.</p>
<p>How much is each of those users worth? I mean, Apple is the apex predator of this entire market,</p>
<p>we wouldn&rsquo;t be having this conversation. But for the fact that Apple&rsquo;s changes with IDFA,</p>
<p>literally pickpocketed the industry $2 billion this year, under the auspices of privacy. And so</p>
<p>if you look at these companies usage up, pricing or are poo down. Okay, recently,</p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s come under a bunch of pressure. So now they&rsquo;re out with scab four, which is their update</p>
<p>to the ad policy post IDFA, that allows you to target advertisers or individuals with 10,000</p>
<p>attributes instead of 100 attributes. So we&rsquo;re going to see some realignment, I expect that</p>
<p>the real question is what happens to our poo next year. But to me, the story here is that</p>
<p>the usage and the health of these core platforms is remarkably sticky. Yeah, for all the things we</p>
<p>say about Instagram, I mean, tick tock has had explosive growth, 30% growth each of the last</p>
<p>three years. But even the incumbent platforms are really sticky usage. This is about how they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>monetizing those users. And the real story is Apple. Yeah. And if you for people don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>IDFA is the identifier for advertisers. Some people refer to it as made mobile ID,</p>
<p>ad ID, I&rsquo;m sorry. And so what that does is it lets you track a user anonymously,</p>
<p>of course, have you ever have you ever owned any clicks to a sale? Right? Have you ever owned</p>
<p>Snapchat stock? No. Why not? I&rsquo;m certainly governance is a key component of it. But the</p>
<p>second thing is, do you have do you have any belief that you could even get a meeting with</p>
<p>the CEO and management where they would listen to you appropriately? We&rsquo;ve certainly got meetings</p>
<p>with management before. So yes, I believe we could, whether or not that impacts, you know,</p>
<p>how they build product, how they how they run the business, you know, the influence, etc.</p>
<p>But again, I think that&rsquo;s not really the problem here. But the point I would</p>
<p>totally agree with you on Shama. We&rsquo;ve had 10 years of where the cost of capital was zero,</p>
<p>10 years of hyper growth for these social networks. Right? In each of the last five years,</p>
<p>Facebook has hired more people in each of the last five years than they had 10 years after the</p>
<p>company was founded. Okay, so as we&rsquo;ve seen this growth begin to turn over, I have seen the</p>
<p>companies really slow to react to right size their behavior that they had over the course of the last</p>
<p>decade, to put themselves in a position to compete for the next decade. So it&rsquo;s one thing just to</p>
<p>throw your hands in the air and say, Well, this is all Apple, we couldn&rsquo;t do anything about it.</p>
<p>But we we really haven&rsquo;t seen leadership in terms of cost control. We really have we all know these</p>
<p>companies could run with you. Yeah, of the of the major companies, Brad snap did do a 20% riff that</p>
<p>had 6000 employees or so and they cut 20%. Facebook is the one that&rsquo;s perplexing because</p>
<p>they seem to be massively over set up staffed, as you talked about, and they have been massively</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve had a massive decline in their stock price, and they are the one who is affected most by</p>
<p>what Apple did in terms of app tracking transparency is, I think that there&rsquo;s a perception</p>
<p>though, I mean, I&rsquo;m still stuck on this issue. I really think that stock prices tend to ebb and</p>
<p>flow based on sort of like friction or momentum. And when there&rsquo;s momentum, more and more people</p>
<p>can easily underwrite it. And when there&rsquo;s friction, fewer and fewer people can underwrite</p>
<p>it. And so I think that if you are a CEO of a public company, you have to think about how many</p>
<p>headwinds do I have? And how many tailwinds do I have all the time, and some of them are in your</p>
<p>control, and some of them are not, at least in the case of meta. As with Apple and Google,</p>
<p>they meta is forced to copy the best decisions of these bigger companies. Why? Because they were one</p>
<p>of those biggest now they may have been the smallest of the biggest, but it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>very hard for meta eventually to not converge on those same set of decisions. And the most important</p>
<p>one is what Brad just alluded to, which is that there was a point in 2016 and 2017, where you</p>
<p>literally could not give away Apple stock. And the big turn of the dial, and you know, some say it</p>
<p>was Carl Icahn, who knows, was this, theoretically, this famous dinner that Carl Icahn had with Tim</p>
<p>Cook, where he laid out a plan. And it&rsquo;s like, listen, you need to start managing costs better,</p>
<p>managing opex better, return a ton of cash, buy back the stock, and you&rsquo;ll be a darling. And Tim</p>
<p>Cook was rewarded. And he&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s been rewarded with an incredibly performant company. And so,</p>
<p>you know, Google is slowly inching towards that plan. Microsoft is in that plan. And so the only</p>
<p>big four horsemen that hasn&rsquo;t really gotten the script yet is meta, but they will, it&rsquo;s just we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just debating when. And so there&rsquo;s a perception that, you know, meta will copy what the rest of</p>
<p>these big guys do. But these other long tail companies, the headwinds are just greater.</p>
<p>And so when you, you know, don&rsquo;t have a company that can be broadly owned by intelligent,</p>
<p>thoughtful investors, that&rsquo;s a headwind, right? When you give nobody votes, that&rsquo;s a headwind.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why you see a company that&rsquo;s continuing to grow impact, not being able to</p>
<p>translate that into economics. And if I were the board of that company, that should be a wake up</p>
<p>call, because eventually that will flow into the morale of the employees and the ability to retain,</p>
<p>and then the ability to invest in the future. And I think the simple answer is enough with all these,</p>
<p>you know, gymnastics around control. You know, if you looked at Elon, the most incredible thing</p>
<p>from day one was, there&rsquo;s common stock, you know, and his whole thing was like, I&rsquo;m just going to</p>
<p>do the best. And you know what, if I&rsquo;m not the best, I&rsquo;m going to be out. He literally said he</p>
<p>is you guys want to ever vote me out, vote me out. He&rsquo;s never ever played these games. So in this</p>
<p>funny way, control is a symbol of a lack of ability to run the business. masterful mastery of</p>
<p>a business, you can translate that to being I&rsquo;m just going to have common stock. Well, I mean,</p>
<p>historical argument, by the way, I&rsquo;m tracking back to the high voting class for founders was</p>
<p>that they would be challenged by the investors in the market. And you can see the things that</p>
<p>Carl Icahn and others asked for. They say, we want to see you cut op ex, we want to see you</p>
<p>pay dividends, we want to see you buy back stock. And we want to see you grow. And so the trade off</p>
<p>then in the mind of a founder that that started this business and scaled it to billions in revenue</p>
<p>is well, that means I&rsquo;ve got to make short term decisions over long term decisions. I&rsquo;ve got to</p>
<p>make the I got to give up some of my long term opportunities to trade for my short term</p>
<p>opportunities. That&rsquo;s the that that was the argument I think originally, for the voting</p>
<p>class. And you can read this in Google&rsquo;s founders letter as well. Does that not apply any founders</p>
<p>at Google don&rsquo;t even show up at the company? Why do they have to have super voting control,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t probably even know what&rsquo;s going on inside the company. It might be an argument like</p>
<p>I just want to hit on Zuck&rsquo;s point, because Zuck has said, Look, you know, this, this VR,</p>
<p>AR metaverse stuff in the future is everything. This is where I want to invest our resources.</p>
<p>But look what happened. They made a missive. They said, we&rsquo;re going in this direction.</p>
<p>Investors really smart, thoughtful, supportive investors, including Brad, were like,</p>
<p>hold on, we&rsquo;re gonna check your roll. And they capitulated. Now, to your point,</p>
<p>did super voting control come into play there? No, of course, he could have said, you know what,</p>
<p>guys, pound sand, I&rsquo;m going to do what I want. Instead, he&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m a smart guy. These guys</p>
<p>are smart guys. So I&rsquo;m going to make the smart decision. So in my opinion, all of these things</p>
<p>are red herrings. These are indirections. Right? So this idea of I&rsquo;m just going to take my toys</p>
<p>out of the sandbox like a crying baby is what super voting control means to me as a shareholder.</p>
<p>Brad, I think the era of super voting control for founders taking companies public is over.</p>
<p>Nope. Should it be? You know, I think it&rsquo;s, again, when Facebook was doing really great,</p>
<p>and Snapchat was doing great, nobody complained about super voting stock. Okay. So I think that,</p>
<p>you know, my preference would be that I partner with a company where I know the founder,</p>
<p>whether irrespective of their votes, right, listens, cares, and has the mental flexibility</p>
<p>to make course corrections. Right. And the reality what I&rsquo;m trying to point to,</p>
<p>we have lived through a decade of excess, everybody knows all these companies could do</p>
<p>exactly the same revenue. David, this is the pushback to your point, unlike what the Google</p>
<p>argument was exactly the same revenue, with vastly less investment in terms of people,</p>
<p>etc. Right. A 20% riff at meta would literally only take them back to where their</p>
<p>personnel expense was in 2021. Yeah, nobody argued in 2021. And they said they were going to do this</p>
<p>to Brad, right. And just hasn&rsquo;t happened yet. This is this is part of the problem. J. Cal,</p>
<p>everybody. So why 10%? Why 10%? You&rsquo;ve doubled the number of people working in the business over</p>
<p>the last few years. Right. There&rsquo;s nothing magical about 10%. The real question is,</p>
<p>what is the optimal number of employees to produce the best outcome for our customers</p>
<p>and our advertisers? And what Bill Gurley has pounded on, and we&rsquo;ve all talked a lot about,</p>
<p>there has been in a zero cost of capital world, a unilateral march to more, more of everything,</p>
<p>invest in everything, hire more people. Silicon Valley would do itself a favor. These big</p>
<p>companies vacuumed up every single engineer in Silicon Valley, they ought to return that pool</p>
<p>to the startups that are actually inventing the future. They don&rsquo;t need this money in place. I</p>
<p>mean, last night, I read a report came across Bloomberg that the Elon&rsquo;s talking about 75%</p>
<p>reduction at Twitter. Yeah. So that would leave Twitter just to give people some context here.</p>
<p>That was that originated in the Washington Post that would take them from around 7500 workers to</p>
<p>maybe 2000 1800. So he&rsquo;s starting from first principles, how many people do I need to build</p>
<p>the next generation of Twitter? That&rsquo;s the question. Start with a blank sheet of paper</p>
<p>and ask that question. You&rsquo;ll come up with very different answers.</p>
<p>Back to the governance question. I think that you can correlate these kinds of governance</p>
<p>overreaches with zero interest rates. That dog doesn&rsquo;t hunt when rates are at four or 5%. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>care who you think you are. But when you try to go public in over the next four or five years,</p>
<p>if rates are sustained, you know, three, four or 5%, that will be the check on all of these people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>overreach because you will have, you know, liquid alternatives that on a risk adjusted basis seem</p>
<p>better. And when rates are zero, and everybody was forced to own tech, we all gave up our</p>
<p>standards. We all stopped saying, you know, oh, you know, the things that we used to think were</p>
<p>important before, like one person, one vote, you know, a check between the board and the CEO,</p>
<p>a check between the executives and the shareholders, they&rsquo;d all went out the window,</p>
<p>no discipline, no hygiene, right? Because when interest rates are at zero percent,</p>
<p>you have to remember, right, how does the structural basics of the financial markets work?</p>
<p>It is meant to make money on behalf of every single entity and person and thing in the world,</p>
<p>from a pension fund to a university to a research lab to a government to an individual. But in that</p>
<p>ability to make money, when we took interest rates to zero, 40% of what we all used to own</p>
<p>bonds yielded nothing. And so we just completely whipsaw to the other side and said we need to own</p>
<p>anything that grows. So tech got a disproportionate amount of attention. But in that we lost our</p>
<p>standards. And we are now going to go through the hangover of dealing with it. And so, you know,</p>
<p>snap will be an example of where investors are going to abandon that company. Because, because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just there&rsquo;s no point, there&rsquo;s no governance, there&rsquo;s no ability to have a conversation. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in the too hard bucket. So people will just leave it, it&rsquo;ll be stranded, and it&rsquo;ll be a refugee in</p>
<p>the public markets. I think meta will be fine eventually, because I think that they will revert</p>
<p>to the mean. And the mean is Microsoft, Google and Apple. And we already know what that playbook</p>
<p>looks like. So I think what Brad predicts is more likely than unlikely. And I think in the future,</p>
<p>to David Friedberg&rsquo;s point, I think it&rsquo;ll be very hard to justify these things. You know,</p>
<p>bankers will be able to push back, because the buy side, ultimately, guys like us who have to</p>
<p>buy the stock when these things go public will say, Nope, you want to have these? You want to</p>
<p>have these dumb governance games? Nope, not for me. I&rsquo;ll just go buy something else. I&rsquo;ll go buy</p>
<p>more Tesla, where it&rsquo;s one person, one vote. Why, you know, so it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s hard when the best CEO in</p>
<p>the world is like, judge me, keep me fire me on an equal basis. And everybody else is like, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>smarter than this guy. And so you know what, let me make sure that whenever I feel like it, I can</p>
<p>throw a temper tantrum and take my toys out of the sandbox. And let&rsquo;s use it. There&rsquo;s an analogy</p>
<p>here doesn&rsquo;t work. Look at look at Steve Jobs ousted from his own company. Company made a huge</p>
<p>mistake asking him some people argue was a learning experience for Steve to get better at his job, he</p>
<p>comes back, and he absolutely turns the company around. So there&rsquo;s an example. Thus far, you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>proven that the two most impactful and important CEOs of the last 50 years had the courage to</p>
<p>basically say, let my performance do the talking, not my protective nanny control. Correct. And</p>
<p>Steve&rsquo;s performance was light in that first period, he had some problems, and he learned,</p>
<p>and he still won. But this is what the greats do the greats know how to perform not, you know,</p>
<p>use some no trade clause to make sure that you can just sit there and underperform forever.</p>
<p>Do we think Brad, when we get to the sort of macro look at this, let&rsquo;s assume we&rsquo;re in this</p>
<p>four or five or 345% interest rate for some extended period of time, let&rsquo;s call it a decade.</p>
<p>What does the tech industry look like? Because it does seem if Elon does with Twitter, what</p>
<p>seems to have been leaked here correctly, according to all reports. And there&rsquo;s a 20%</p>
<p>riff at Facebook, and we start to see people take the medicine. Is that the ultimate setup for now?</p>
<p>Hey, these companies are being run to throw off cash. And we have some way out of this,</p>
<p>what people think is going to be a very hard landing?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, you know, first, just let&rsquo;s talk about, you know, where rates are, you know, today,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re at four, three on the on the 10 year, I mean, technologies performed incredibly</p>
<p>well for a long period of time with rates in this, in this range. So the adjustment period</p>
<p>is very difficult. Right. And so when you when you look at the convexity,</p>
<p>and going from 0% interest rates to four and a half, like that has been a shock to the system,</p>
<p>it has been destabilizing to multiples, multiples were basically infinite last year. And now</p>
<p>multiples have come back to reality. And so I don&rsquo;t question In fact, I actually think</p>
<p>free capital was a weapon of economic destruction. Right? free capital hurt good companies from being</p>
<p>great companies. They hired too many people, their margins were too low, you know, SoftBank funding,</p>
<p>all of these rideshare companies around the world to compete with Uber meant that Uber,</p>
<p>even though they&rsquo;re a market leader, did not have market leadership economics. And so the</p>
<p>ringing out of the system of that excess, that grift, that stupidity, that&rsquo;s going to be good</p>
<p>for the fundamentals of these business. But the transition from, you know, that low rate environment</p>
<p>to the high rate of our it&rsquo;s dislocating for investors. It&rsquo;s dislocating for management at</p>
<p>these companies, and it&rsquo;s going to be just what this is not, you know, a six month phenomenon,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to have two years of ringing out, right? Because there&rsquo;s no bailout here by the</p>
<p>Fed. There&rsquo;s no v shape recovery for these companies. This is now going to be I heard</p>
<p>somebody say this week, if the last 10 years was about beta, the next 10 years is about alpha.</p>
<p>Not all companies are going to do well, not all companies are going to bounce back.</p>
<p>This is going to be about what companies have the courage to build great products and to drive a</p>
<p>great business model that allows them to compete and continue to invest at high rates in the next</p>
<p>wave of innovation, whether it&rsquo;s AI, etc. And so, you know, to me, the markets J Cal have largely</p>
<p>put in a box at this point, inflation and rates, right rates have come up 65%. And, you know,</p>
<p>from 2.7 to four, three in the last 60 days, and the market&rsquo;s basically sideways, it&rsquo;s down five</p>
<p>to 10%. rates are up another 10% in the last two weeks, and Google and Apple are up. That tells me</p>
<p>that the market&rsquo;s gotten, you know, gotten its arms around rates and inflation, what the market</p>
<p>really is worried about now are two things. Number one is earnings. And number two is the long tail</p>
<p>of risk. On earnings, there&rsquo;s kind of a conventional wisdom emerging from from many folks that 3200</p>
<p>the bottom or maybe 2700 the bottom that we&rsquo;re going to go from 225. And in S&amp;P earnings back</p>
<p>to 200. That seems to me to be, you know, again, a lot of people making that bet. I don&rsquo;t see any</p>
<p>evidence in q3 earnings, United Healthcare, United Airlines, Schlumberger, Tesla, etc. Their earnings</p>
<p>are up on a year over year basis. They&rsquo;ve guided now to q4, their earnings are going to be up on a</p>
<p>year over year basis. And the consensus expectations in q1 are that earnings are going to be up on a</p>
<p>year over year basis to go from 225 down to 200. We it can&rsquo;t just be a slowing of the rate of growth</p>
<p>of earnings, you have to reverse course entirely. So we have to see something we&rsquo;re not seeing yet.</p>
<p>So on an earnings growth, that&rsquo;s where the market there&rsquo;s some tension in the market.</p>
<p>Then finally, what I would say is there are a lot of big brains in the world who look at this</p>
<p>level of dislocation rates going on the two year or on the front end of the curve from zero to four</p>
<p>and a half. And Druckenmiller or Soros would say negative reflexivity. Shit breaks when you have</p>
<p>this much volatility in the world, the world is not equipped to deal with these exponential moves.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a lot of concern in the world, whether it&rsquo;s about Ukraine, Taiwan, UK bonds,</p>
<p>the Japanese yen, nobody knows what it will be. But they&rsquo;re just saying demand a higher margin</p>
<p>of safety, because the propensity, the likelihood that shit breaks when you have this much dislocation</p>
<p>is higher. So the preferable black swan could come any minute, and another downdraft.</p>
<p>But last year, we were all sitting here and said asymmetry to the downside,</p>
<p>multiples at all time high interest rates at all time low, we saw that starting to roll over,</p>
<p>we saw smart people, Elon basis, etc, start to sell into it. As I sit here today, yes,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to have harder times ahead economically, but it feels to me like a lot</p>
<p>of it is priced in. I don&rsquo;t think we have huge asymmetry and skewed to the downside. I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like fighting the last battle. It&rsquo;s not to say in this distribution of probabilities,</p>
<p>one of those events can&rsquo;t occur. But from my vantage when stocks, the average stock down 20%,</p>
<p>stocks like Meta down 50 to 60%, a lot of stocks down 70, 80, 90. That doesn&rsquo;t seem like the time</p>
<p>to call the big short. That seems like a time to be like neutral to positive.</p>
<p>Should we go to TV pi dpi and talk about the privates? I just want to say one thing about</p>
<p>your prior question, which kind of ties into some of what Brad said, but you asked the question</p>
<p>about does this mean that these companies are now going to kind of cut costs and start spitting out</p>
<p>cash? I think there is certainly a market incentive to do that to keep share prices up.</p>
<p>And the companies that can do that are certainly taking action with the headcount reduction</p>
<p>across some of the big guys. What I think is going to be interesting and what a lot of people</p>
<p>are watching is how many of the small and mid cap guys can actually do that. And those that can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>will it will become pretty evident pretty fast. And they&rsquo;re going to end up in the shitter.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking to a palatine or something like that.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter across SAS across consumer across DTC across hardware. Everyone is now saying can</p>
<p>you actually earn and at this point, you should have enough scale that you should be able to earn</p>
<p>and if you cannot, the market will punish you for it. And that&rsquo;s certainly what seems to be the</p>
<p>incentive and the pressure in the on the buy side to the executives across all these organizations</p>
<p>today. So I think that&rsquo;s a big trend of what&rsquo;s happening right now is everyone&rsquo;s going through</p>
<p>their portfolio, spending time with management and asking, can you earn? Can you actually get</p>
<p>this business to generate cash? What is the path? Show it to me, prove it to me in the quarterly</p>
<p>results. And if you can&rsquo;t, then you&rsquo;re not fitting in a bucket that I can own you.</p>
<p>The only irony there, Friedberg, is that that comes as a surprise. God forbid,</p>
<p>we should actually expect companies to prove unit economics and to make profit.</p>
<p>Yeah, but when you when when your interest rate zero, you divide by zero, you get infinity. So</p>
<p>you know, you were able to kind of explain everything away into the future. Now you</p>
<p>actually have an interest rate at 5%. I got to be you know, making I&rsquo;m not going to pay a lot more</p>
<p>than 20 times earnings. And I want to see that that&rsquo;s really my earnings. You know, I want to</p>
<p>see that you can actually earn there was a person at Brad&rsquo;s investor day who Brad interviewed. And</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t say his name, but he&rsquo;s a star of stars. He&rsquo;s a bit of a goat. And he had I&rsquo;ll just say</p>
<p>the generalized version of believe it out. And said the following, which is so true. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve gone through an entire decade of under training an entire generation of people in</p>
<p>Silicon Valley. You know, we have under under trained and under mentored the product managers,</p>
<p>the engineers, the senior executive management, the CEOs, many of these people, unfortunately,</p>
<p>are not they don&rsquo;t have the skill set to execute at a high level at any point in the cycle, except</p>
<p>when rates were zero, like many business models. And now that rates are not at zero, these people</p>
<p>are turning out to be extremely underdeveloped and unable to run these businesses. And when he</p>
<p>said that it really struck a chord because he&rsquo;s right. And you know, he was also saying it just</p>
<p>got even more exacerbated in this era of remote work. Because now there is even less opportunity</p>
<p>to mentor and to coach and to talk one on one. And people think, you know, that this is a boon,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not. So, you know, we&rsquo;re going to deal with also the aftermath of an entire generation</p>
<p>of highly underskilled companies. Because the executive and senior leadership and CEO ranks of</p>
<p>many of these companies are not in a position to win. If I may, there was an interesting moment</p>
<p>this week when we talk about this discipline that has been lacking the last couple years</p>
<p>$101 million funding led by CO2 Lightspeed Venture Partners at a $1 billion valuation</p>
<p>for stability AI. This is a for profit company built off the backs of the open source</p>
<p>project, stable diffusion, they have no revenue, they have no product, they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been around for, you know, a millisecond. Any thoughts on this type of funding happening pre</p>
<p>product pre revenue on an open source project? And there&rsquo;s still there&rsquo;s always going to be</p>
<p>Yeah, pretty well. It&rsquo;s not my money is going to be these, these asymmetric bets that people</p>
<p>think if it works, it&rsquo;s worth 100. And they&rsquo;ll price it as they price it. I think that I think</p>
<p>what we were just talking about is a little different, which is how do public markets</p>
<p>rationalize evaluation. These businesses need to start earning for the public investors to be able</p>
<p>to represent to their investors, that they&rsquo;re doing their job and making sure that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>holding management accountable to demonstrating earnings potential. But these early stage bets,</p>
<p>you can see valuations range depending on the asymmetric outcome potential of the and you know</p>
<p>what the upper and you know what the upper bound is, the upper bound is that when rates were zero,</p>
<p>and governments were printing money more than they could get their hands on,</p>
<p>the top five tech companies represented a quarter of the S&amp;P 500. But there was a pretty steep</p>
<p>fall off. And everybody else represented the next, you know, about 10% of the market cap.</p>
<p>So the point is that we had bounded outcomes. When rates were zero, the average market cap</p>
<p>of a successful company was around three or $4 billion. So I&rsquo;m not going to judge this company</p>
<p>at all. And those investors are very smart investors, Lightspeed and CO2. What I will say</p>
<p>is at the end of the day, there&rsquo;s a terminal buyer of these companies. And we had a period of time</p>
<p>that we can look back on to understand that when the party is absolutely rip roaring,</p>
<p>the alcohol is free, you know, everything, everything is going well. Yeah, we know what</p>
<p>the upper bound is, which is the average company, if you were able to get out would be worth about</p>
<p>three to $4 billion. And then there was a very, very steep dispersion, where then there was four</p>
<p>companies that were, you know, a quarter of the market cap and a few in between. So if you do a</p>
<p>deal at a billion, the overwhelming odds is that the terminal exit multiple is going to be somewhere</p>
<p>between a 3x and a 4x x of dilution, and x of all of the other capital that comes in and all of</p>
<p>those features that may be attached. So I think everybody should be allowed to make different</p>
<p>kinds of bets. And you&rsquo;ll see over time, which kind of deal can generate which kind of return,</p>
<p>Brad, it&rsquo;ll be it, this will be a really interesting data point.</p>
<p>The common thinking was, these kind of deals were not going to happen</p>
<p>in this kind of a market. So when you saw this kind of deal happen, or some other that we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>talked about privately, what do you think is happening in terms of discipline, private markets,</p>
<p>I think, I think, I think maybe you should tee this up with Brad, because I think that</p>
<p>what I have to say follows on, okay, with him, but there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a macro view of</p>
<p>the venture industry, that, again, it&rsquo;s like, everybody wants to never look at the past.</p>
<p>Everybody wants to assume that this time is different. And there&rsquo;s some work that he did,</p>
<p>which is really instructive, J Cal, to help answer this question, I think. So maybe you</p>
<p>should ask him, and then I&rsquo;ll jump in afterwards. This is the TV, TV pi study. Yeah. So I mean,</p>
<p>Brad, in relation to my stable diffusion, and yeah, DPI, maybe you can tell you know,</p>
<p>we shared this with our investors at our investor day that you guys are at this week,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a modern industry, it&rsquo;s only been around since the mid 90s. Right? So the history</p>
<p>of venture, you know, is, you got to look at when you look at returns, it&rsquo;s to say,</p>
<p>by the way, what an incredible chart you guys put, this is so good.</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s describe the chart for people who the truth hurts.</p>
<p>So break down, let&rsquo;s go ahead, J Cal, do you want to just so if just for people who know we on</p>
<p>Spotify, and on YouTube, you can search for all in episode 101. And you could see this chart,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re watching the video, if you&rsquo;re listening, the video describes 1997 to 2020,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an orange line across it with the DPI average. So why don&rsquo;t you define DPI?</p>
<p>What we did is we took the top quartile data from Cambridge Associates, who</p>
<p>invest in all across the entire venture industry is widely used as kind of industry data. And we</p>
<p>just asked a simple question of the top quartile top 25% of venture capital firms, right? What were</p>
<p>in those vintage years of the funds, so funds raised in 97 9899? What were the average</p>
<p>cash on cash returns, right? TVPI is what your mark is, that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re carrying</p>
<p>the marks total value to paid in capital.</p>
<p>So this could be just so we&rsquo;re clear, because it&rsquo;s a little confusing to people,</p>
<p>you have a company on your books that on paper is worth 10 billion, you had put in at a billion.</p>
<p>And on paper, you&rsquo;ve got this 10x return, right?</p>
<p>Correct. DPI is actually cash distributed to your investors. So that&rsquo;s cash on the barrelhead.</p>
<p>So the reason if you look on this chart,</p>
<p>sorry, just to just to build just to be very clear for everybody, the whole goal is to be</p>
<p>able to convert your TVPI. So what your theoretical book is worth into DPI, which is here&rsquo;s money back</p>
<p>to my investors. And what you want on this chart is the blue line to catch up to the gray line.</p>
<p>So you want the gray line to be as high as possible. And eventually, over time,</p>
<p>you want the blue line to come up. Correct, right. So the blue line here,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re looking at 2010, just for one example, you have a four x for the TVPI,</p>
<p>you four x everybody&rsquo;s money, but the blue line only got up to it looks like 3.5 x,</p>
<p>maybe or something in that right. Let me just point out because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an interesting year, Jason. Yeah, we were coming out of the 2008 2009</p>
<p>period. Everybody was despondent. They said, I&rsquo;m sure they said what you just said about stable</p>
<p>diffusion. Don&rsquo;t invest in anything. Everybody&rsquo;s stupid. But there were incredible companies</p>
<p>that were invested out of that vintage, right? Snowflake and Mongo out of our vintage shortly</p>
<p>thereafter. So maintaining this duality that, yes, the world sucks, but the secular curve of</p>
<p>innovation continues. So that is a vintage where people actually got things sold, got them public,</p>
<p>distributed the cash back to investors. The real question is this. On the vintages between 2011,</p>
<p>2012, and now. How how much of those gray lines, how much of those marks? Look,</p>
<p>those are historical marks. Marks have never been this high. How much of those marks will</p>
<p>actually return turn into cash on the barrelhead? And how much of those will actually just be mean</p>
<p>reversion? It&rsquo;ll all get marked down and the returns at the top quartile will look much like</p>
<p>the returns did in the period between 2000 and 2007. My hunch is that by the time the cash is</p>
<p>actually distributed, the returns are going to revert to that orange line mean, which means</p>
<p>there are hundreds of billions of dollars in markdowns sitting in LP&rsquo;s and GP&rsquo;s portfolios</p>
<p>that are likely to come because nobody really thinks that the deals done in 1516 1718 are going</p>
<p>to be that far above the mean return. And so people also understand this. These are vintage</p>
<p>years. So these are funds formed in that year. And so this trails a venture fund takes about 10 years,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re formed without concept in mind to become realized. So if you&rsquo;re looking at you know, the</p>
<p>year 2016 and 17. These are but five year old funds at this point, right? Correct. Yeah. So</p>
<p>they do need time for these companies to grow. How much of this Chamath and Freeberg do you think is</p>
<p>attributable to entry price? Because entry price during 2017 1819 20 is going to be extraordinarily</p>
<p>high entry price, ie the value of the company when investors invested in 28 2008 to 2011 when I had a</p>
<p>lot of my hits was pretty low. I invested in Uber, thumbtack. And you invest in Uber calm.</p>
<p>Those three were $15 million combined revaluations. Yeah, you you invest in Uber?</p>
<p>I yeah, maybe third or fourth investor. I can&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>I did get in there. I got in there slightly before you did like maybe you should years</p>
<p>you you should write a book on angel invest. I should. Yeah. You should call it an angel.</p>
<p>You should call it a very good, very good. But let&rsquo;s talk about entry price because entry price</p>
<p>does matter, Brad, or maybe Chamath you want to take entry price for freeberg?</p>
<p>Well, look, there&rsquo;s this, I think I think what that setup is, that&rsquo;s probably a chart that most</p>
<p>VC organizations don&rsquo;t even look at. Because if you looked at that chart, you&rsquo;d have to take a</p>
<p>real investing approach to things. So if you were looking at that chart as a GP, there are two</p>
<p>takeaways. The first takeaway is, Oh, my gosh, what is the sum of the invested dollars above</p>
<p>this orange line since 2012? 2011? Right? Because all of that stuff could just get basically get</p>
<p>whacked if we mean revert. And the answer is about five or $600 billion of paid in capital.</p>
<p>So then you would say, Oh, my gosh, well, if there&rsquo;s five or $600 billion of impairment,</p>
<p>coming down the pipe, maybe more, maybe it&rsquo;s going to be 750 million. Because the other thing</p>
<p>to keep in mind is, over time, the the orange line has a tendency to go down, not up, right?</p>
<p>Because as you add more and more of these things, and some slight performers,</p>
<p>you have a general decay function in every asset class as it scales in size.</p>
<p>So this this orange line theoretically goes down, which means more of those gray bars get destroyed.</p>
<p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s just call it 600 billion or 700 billion. The most important thing you would</p>
<p>want to do is now look inside your portfolio and try to answer the question. Oh, how likely am I</p>
<p>to see that impairment? And Jason, this is a proxy of answering your question,</p>
<p>the important question for a venture fund, which then has a downstream implication to the to the</p>
<p>entrepreneur is, now, what do I do knowing that all of these gray bars could get destroyed? And</p>
<p>Nick, go to the next chart? Well, I calculated it for you guys. So I&rsquo;ll give you the answer.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a simple thing. And you know, this is publicly available data.</p>
<p>Now, why did I do this? Because when Brad showed me that chart, my immediate mind went to how do I</p>
<p>make sure I&rsquo;m not susceptible to losing a ton of money? Well, what happens in markets is that when</p>
<p>things go down, the things that are highly correlated go down the most. Because they are</p>
<p>the things that are the most highly trafficked, which means that they are the things that have</p>
<p>the most investors, which means that in an up market, they have the propensity to have the</p>
<p>highest prices. So we put we, you know, pulled all this data from PitchBook. And we just started to I</p>
<p>just took a smattering of firms here. And recent index, Greylock, benchmark, Sequoia, GC, Founders</p>
<p>Fund, Tiger, Excel, Kleiner, Koestler, and us, you could pick anybody because this data is publicly</p>
<p>available. And I started to calculate the overlap coefficient. So how, how correlated are you with</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s portfolios, trying to estimate at the upper bound and at the lower bound, what will</p>
<p>happen? So Jason, this is a proxy of answering your question. What about entry price? Well,</p>
<p>if you have a very low correlation, which touch wood, we have, you&rsquo;re less, you&rsquo;re less exposed</p>
<p>to bad entry price, because it wouldn&rsquo;t have been a bidding war to get into these companies.</p>
<p>Exactly. You picked your right spot, you went into areas that were earlier, so you were able to risk</p>
<p>manage a little bit better. But if you have a highly correlated portfolio, now your marks become</p>
<p>very susceptible. So my guess is, if you take the $700 billion, and you calculate it for all the VCs,</p>
<p>and you look at their correlations, and their overlaps, you can probably guesstimate where that</p>
<p>$700 billion of impairment will come to. And you can you can lay it out across any organization that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re interested in trying to find a solution for by just stack ranking them. And by looking at the</p>
<p>at the at these correlations. And this is, by the way, to be clear, nothing about the quality of the</p>
<p>organization or the people. But this is just simple portfolio mathematics and how portfolios tend to</p>
<p>play itself out in moments like this. Well, and there&rsquo;s some interesting data in here as well.</p>
<p>Freeberg, you probably are aware of, where some fund like let&rsquo;s say, Founders Fund and Koestler</p>
<p>have a close relationship because Keith Reboy was at Koestler and then he moved to Founders Fund. So</p>
<p>you see that nice dark purple there where they have a high correlation investments. Interestingly,</p>
<p>index seems to just follow benchmark and Bill Gurley&rsquo;s investments and plow into them. That seems</p>
<p>to be the highest correlation. Here&rsquo;s the thing, if you had to steel man the defense of that strategy,</p>
<p>Jason, I would say in an up market, benchmark is a $500 million fund where I get no allocation. If</p>
<p>I was a smart LP, and I did this work, I&rsquo;d be immediately knocking on indexes door saying,</p>
<p>can I put money in you? Because in the back of my mind, it&rsquo;s basically getting leverage on</p>
<p>benchmarks portfolio. Yeah, you figured out how to follow them. Yeah, yeah. But when the cycle</p>
<p>reverts, you know, you&rsquo;re not the only one that wants to copy benchmarks portfolio, everybody does.</p>
<p>And if these correlations are too high, and the overlaps are too high, then you start to get into</p>
<p>a cycle where you put yourself in a position to actually suffer from the market beta much more,</p>
<p>even when you can benefit from the market beta and upcycle.</p>
<p>Freeberg, you want to analyze this chart and Chamath&rsquo;s thinking here his theory?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. I mean, I just think this has become a pretty competitive market and a lot</p>
<p>of the value has been competed away. Well, I mean, I think for a for a layperson, please.</p>
<p>Yeah, the long term value creation of technology of new technology is going to remain high,</p>
<p>the market&rsquo;s going to pay for that. So you know, new market value creation,</p>
<p>new market cap is going to continue to be built every year. What&rsquo;s happening when venture has a</p>
<p>low multiple is that number one, the good companies end up the founders end up owning more</p>
<p>of the company. And they end up, you know, having a higher percentage ownership when the company</p>
<p>ultimately gets sold or goes public, because they were able to get VCs to compete against one</p>
<p>another. And as a result, pay a higher valuation and as a result, buy less of the company.</p>
<p>And then number two is that because the VCs that couldn&rsquo;t get into that company still had a bunch</p>
<p>of money to manage, they wouldn&rsquo;t put money into crappy companies. So you know, it&rsquo;s a lucrative</p>
<p>business. You guys, everyone&rsquo;s in that business, because it&rsquo;s a lucrative business. And that</p>
<p>certainly it takes a decade to realize whether or not you&rsquo;re good at it. So you know, you have this</p>
<p>period of time as Brad shows that maybe a decade before the LP market learns who is and who isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>bad. And meanwhile, those folks who got competed out of the good deals, you know, they don&rsquo;t look</p>
<p>very good. And the folks that are left in the good deals own less of the company, and their</p>
<p>returns get diminished. And, you know, I think ultimately, this market is probably going to end</p>
<p>up being a multi decade cycle of capital in and capital out, we&rsquo;re probably at peak capital being</p>
<p>managed in venture funds right now, and will likely decline for the next decade.</p>
<p>Brad, how would Yeah, Brad, how would LPS look at</p>
<p>Chamath analysis there? And how do they look at the clubby nature and overlap,</p>
<p>you know, writ large in our industry, and then whatever other insights you have?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I mean, I think I very much disagree with David that all the returns are getting</p>
<p>competed away. The huge difference between the venture market and the private equity market or</p>
<p>the public market is that the venture market is unquestionably a power law market. Okay,</p>
<p>90% of the gross profits and the returns go to 10% of the deals and 10% of the investors,</p>
<p>right. So we just show the average of the top quartile. But if we show benchmark one or two,</p>
<p>or benchmark six or seven, it&rsquo;s ridiculous, right? The cash on cash returns over 20.</p>
<p>On those funds. Let&rsquo;s just pause and explain that to folks.</p>
<p>Most venture firms here are getting two x on average, that&rsquo;s the average. And is that average</p>
<p>for the top quartile or all VC firms? It&rsquo;s the top quartile of VC firms,</p>
<p>their average is two x. Yeah, this is the upper 20 to 25%. So if you were to include the 75 bottom,</p>
<p>what would the trash? Brad, let me ask you a question. What if instead of looking at the top</p>
<p>quartile, you just looked at the top 10 venture firms? Yeah, because the number of venture firms</p>
<p>has exploded over the last decade and a half. But so I think the point that you&rsquo;re not getting is</p>
<p>the top 10 changes every vintage. And the problem is if you are aping the wrong portfolio in that</p>
<p>vintage, you&rsquo;ll get run over. Right. And so the real goal of this, and I also tend to disagree</p>
<p>freebrook with what you say, I don&rsquo;t think the returns are getting competed away. I actually</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s more alpha than ever. Correct. And you got to be a good picker. And if you&rsquo;re a momentum</p>
<p>investor, you just need to be aware on the way in that you are going to put your portfolio under</p>
<p>tremendous pressure in drawdowns. I think the other thing the other thing it does.</p>
<p>This idea of the industrialization of venture, the soft banks, the tigers, like, like, it&rsquo;s a myth.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t industrialize that you can industry, you can build an index fund to the public market,</p>
<p>because you can buy every company, you might even be able to build an index like fund in</p>
<p>private equity, because everybody can go bid for every company. But in venture, the founder chooses</p>
<p>you. That early GP chooses you. And so if you try to build an index fund that misses the best deals,</p>
<p>and I think there&rsquo;s adverse selection, the bigger you get, the less likely you&rsquo;re to convert the</p>
<p>best deals. Now you&rsquo;re really in trouble. Brad, do you think an index of first time</p>
<p>VCs outperforms kind of that, you know, top quartile index. So you know, there&rsquo;s some LPs</p>
<p>that select in to just solo GP, first time fund manager, first time fund, or, you know,</p>
<p>maybe second time, but solo GP, but it&rsquo;s kind of like, you know, first into the market before you</p>
<p>really scale up. That&rsquo;s where so many of the returns are found a lot of funds like MIT.</p>
<p>They look for emerging managers, because you tend to be younger, hungrier, you have experience,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got a lot on the line. But certainly, if you look at the hundreds of startups in VC land</p>
<p>over the course of the last several years, 99% of them are probably garbage and will fail and</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t work. So the all stars will be all stars and the rest won&rsquo;t. Somebody asked me, I use this</p>
<p>analog. They said hundreds of new people have come into venture. And I said, Yeah, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like a marathon. You&rsquo;re right. We had 500 runners, and now we have 1000 runners.</p>
<p>But from my vantage, it&rsquo;s the same five to 10 runners competing for the podium</p>
<p>week in and week out. In that top 10 in that power law, it doesn&rsquo;t change a lot. Yes,</p>
<p>there have been people break in. We know how hard it is to break in to Silicon Valley. Nobody invited</p>
<p>altimeter to the dance. Nobody invited social capital to the dance. Nobody invited Jason</p>
<p>Calacanis to the dance. It was the opposite. They lock the doors. Trust me, because it&rsquo;s a highly</p>
<p>lucrative business, dominated by some incumbents that had huge brands, they didn&rsquo;t want to share</p>
<p>the fruits of that we showed up, we worked hard, we build incredible teams, we had conviction.</p>
<p>Right. And we were we also had good fortune. Right? Yes, we were smart. We were we play some</p>
<p>good bets. But you also have to get lucky in this business. We were lucky to be born at this point</p>
<p>in time lucky to start when we did in Silicon Valley. I&rsquo;m going to finish just with this one</p>
<p>point. This whole experiment of venture capital is less than 30 years old. The modern age of</p>
<p>venture capital is 30 less than 30 years old. We&rsquo;re going through this period where everybody</p>
<p>wants to shit all over the industry, you know, TVP is going to come down all this other stuff.</p>
<p>I think that venture my dad when he went to start a business had to borrow money mortgage the house.</p>
<p>Think about the friction for somebody with a young family. If the cost of failure was losing your</p>
<p>house, putting your family in harm&rsquo;s way, versus some young startup in Silicon Valley today, where</p>
<p>the consequence of failure, particularly if you if you conduct yourself with integrity, is that</p>
<p>you learn a lot. Right? There&rsquo;s no losing a house, there&rsquo;s no cataclysmic outcome for your family.</p>
<p>So to me, when you look at the economic unlock that we have in this country, by reducing friction</p>
<p>to invention, by reducing friction to experimentation, I am incredibly bullish on the</p>
<p>future of venture. I think founders are the engine that drives the world forward. Right? That&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>we get electric cars. That&rsquo;s where we get rockets that land themselves. That&rsquo;s where we get mRNA</p>
<p>vaccines. And so there will be cyclicality, there will be industrialization, there will be big funds</p>
<p>and small funds. But the reality is that this ecosystem is a massive competitive advantage for</p>
<p>this country. I think when we look forward at the information age over the next 30 years, the power</p>
<p>of this ecosystem is more strategic advantage to this country, even the natural resources.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say I&rsquo;ll say something orthogonal to this, which is in order for that to happen.</p>
<p>Just to build on the point, Brad, of your guests that you&rsquo;re saying, we have an entire generation</p>
<p>of financially innumerate general partners at venture firms. And venture needs to be a pillar</p>
<p>of growth in society. And I think people need to have more financial tools and underpinnings to</p>
<p>do their job. Why? Because over these next 10 years, when maybe you have 500 to three quarters</p>
<p>of a trillion dollars of value destruction, and it&rsquo;s because you didn&rsquo;t think about portfolio</p>
<p>construction properly, that entrepreneur that needs your money, you will have to say no to them,</p>
<p>or renege on a deal, or let them down. And the reason is that you didn&rsquo;t think about that on</p>
<p>the way in. And so these are practical skills that every other part of the financial asset</p>
<p>infrastructure has to learn, we are taught the hard way. You know, we are taught in the public</p>
<p>markets how to think about dispersion, correlation, alpha, beta, you&rsquo;re taught in private equity,</p>
<p>how to do it, you&rsquo;re taught in every other asset class, and we romanticize venture to think that</p>
<p>none of that matters. But in a moment like this, you will see how much or how much it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>matter. And if you&rsquo;re going to live up to the to the actual commitment you make to an entrepreneur,</p>
<p>you better get financially smarter is what I would say.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s move on. Do you want to go to stock picking or lift versus Newsom on this prop</p>
<p>30? I want to hear that Freebird diatribe. Let&rsquo;s talk. You do? Okay, I want to hear it.</p>
<p>Well, anyway, there&rsquo;s a bunch of people talking about index funds versus buying individual shares</p>
<p>and being a stock picker. Elon and Cathie Wood got into this on Twitter. And we all know the</p>
<p>arguments for passive versus active. And there&rsquo;s large active funds out there that are just</p>
<p>programmatically buying and Elon and many think that active would be better for society or a bit</p>
<p>more active. Freebird, what&rsquo;s your take? A business is a over time. It&rsquo;s supposed to be a machine that</p>
<p>takes money in and puts money out. And then there&rsquo;s money left in the machine. It&rsquo;s like a box</p>
<p>money comes in money goes out. And over time, the objective of the money coming in, which is sales or</p>
<p>revenue exceeds the money going out and the box grows, right, the assets grow. And the best way</p>
<p>to look at that is in the financial statements of that business, you know, the income statement,</p>
<p>the balance sheet, the cash flow statement. But we and then there&rsquo;s this narrative that can be</p>
<p>layered on top of those metrics, that measurement of how well that business is performing over time.</p>
<p>And that narrative is what drives a lot of investment decisions. Today, right, I see whether</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an analyst, writing an analyst report, or portfolio manager, or an individual picking a</p>
<p>stock, everyone&rsquo;s got a reason why they&rsquo;re buying the stock. And they say, here&rsquo;s my thesis. And</p>
<p>what happens is everyone looks at that box, looks at that business looks at that thesis from a</p>
<p>different angle. And there&rsquo;s always something you&rsquo;re missing. So there you know, there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>element that is driven by imperfect information. And in some cases, it&rsquo;s just heavy bias. You know,</p>
<p>you look at a stock, you&rsquo;re like, hey, I really like Disney Plus, I really like the subscriber</p>
<p>growth. But the question fundamentally is over time, what is the revenue generation and the</p>
<p>profit generation potential of that one thing you&rsquo;re looking at? And what are the 100 other</p>
<p>things that are going to contribute to that business, that box, taking in more money or</p>
<p>spending more money? Is that box going to run into a regulatory problem? Is it going to run</p>
<p>into a customer problem? Is it going to run into a content problem? Is it going to run into</p>
<p>competition? The number of issues and opportunities that any one of these businesses can and will face</p>
<p>is infinite. And every participant in a market is looking at some different set of those opportunities</p>
<p>or threats. And every participant in that market is making a different value judgment.</p>
<p>And so very often, people will buy a stock because they see their sliver, they convince</p>
<p>themselves that based on the sliver of the perspective that they have, that this is something</p>
<p>I want to own. They don&rsquo;t do the work on what&rsquo;s the income statement balance sheet cash flow</p>
<p>going to tell me over time about the quality of that business. And they don&rsquo;t do the work on what</p>
<p>the valuation of the business is relative to comparables relative to future earning potential.</p>
<p>And I just wanted to have this diatribe because I see so many individuals doing stock picking.</p>
<p>And over time, because of this myriad of things that could go wrong and will go wrong,</p>
<p>or may go right or won&rsquo;t go right, or the regulatory thing or the market thing,</p>
<p>or whatever interest rate thing hits that stock and the stock price goes down.</p>
<p>Eventually, everyone gets hit on the head. And everyone reverts to mean or below mean,</p>
<p>meaning the average of the index over time, or underperforms that index over time.</p>
<p>And so, I mean, for me, I spent two years, I know, we all went through some sort of</p>
<p>investment banking training, I spent two years out of college without a I had no finance econ</p>
<p>or business background. I worked in investment banking, learned how to read an income statement</p>
<p>balance sheet cash flow, learn to understand how business performance ultimately translates into</p>
<p>financial outcomes, and spent a lot of time on valuation. And figuring out just because you like</p>
<p>the story of a stock, you like the story that the CEO is telling you doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re paying a fair price. So if you if everything they do goes right, this price could still drop.</p>
<p>And I think that this is a really important set of lessons for people that are individuals that</p>
<p>are doing stock picking, which is the number one message and this diatribe is specifically</p>
<p>targeted towards day traders retail, correct? I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s just them. I think it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>generally like make sure you understand how to read an income statement balance sheet and cash</p>
<p>flow statement. Number two, make sure you know how to assess valuation. Make sure you know that when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re buying a stock, you know what the total value of the company is based on the price you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>paying. And how do you justify that that total value makes sense relative to your model of the</p>
<p>future outcomes for that business. And then number three, recognize and be cognizant of the fact</p>
<p>that whatever one thing you&rsquo;re seeing that you think you&rsquo;ve got some edge or some advantage on</p>
<p>because no one else is seeing it. There&rsquo;s 99 other things that you&rsquo;re not seeing.</p>
<p>And this is where everyone learns this lesson over time, and everyone gets bonked on the head</p>
<p>at some point in making these decisions. And it&rsquo;s why every stock picker or nearly every we can talk</p>
<p>about the greats at some point here, and where alpha can be generated and so on. But generally,</p>
<p>most stock pickers over time, underperform the index. And it&rsquo;s just particularly with the retail</p>
<p>movement over the last couple of years, I see a lot of thesis, here&rsquo;s my reason for buying the</p>
<p>stock that excludes understanding the financials, understanding the valuation metrics, and also</p>
<p>excludes the whole litany of things and all the diligence that goes into thinking about all the</p>
<p>other angles you might be missing. So that was my bottle or feedback generally, it turns out that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to be good at anything. Insert the blank takes 10s of 1000s of years of practice.</p>
<p>In investing, I think what I have learned is that it&rsquo;s very easy to get caught up in the mania.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also learned in the last decade that, you know, we really benefited from zero interest rates,</p>
<p>it was a tide that lifted all boats. And I have learned how to think about correlation,</p>
<p>and the difference between alpha and beta, and how to construct portfolios that I think can</p>
<p>be all weather portfolios. To Friedberg&rsquo;s point, those are nuanced, long tail skills that you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>only take up if you&rsquo;re really passionate about the craft. It&rsquo;s not dissimilar to a person,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to use golf as an example, who learns how to hit a fade versus a draw and who</p>
<p>learns how to really manipulate, you know, their wedges in very specific ways. And these are all</p>
<p>long tail skills that come in when you decide you want to master something.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just important to note that that mastery is required to be really good.</p>
<p>Because otherwise, there&rsquo;ll be times where you&rsquo;ll go out on the golf course, and you&rsquo;ll crush it.</p>
<p>But then, you know, there&rsquo;ll be other times and most other times where you can go and get run</p>
<p>over because it&rsquo;s hard. So that&rsquo;s my only comment is that this is like everything else. It&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>nearly as easy as it looks like Brad, you pick stocks for a living should retail, how involved</p>
<p>should retail investors be? Should they just buy an index? I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair to say retail,</p>
<p>what I think my point was really about. No, his point is everybody. Okay, sure, everybody.</p>
<p>My point is saying a thesis, and excluding all these other factors that are critical in making</p>
<p>a decision about what you&rsquo;re buying and whether you&rsquo;re paying the right price means that you have</p>
<p>to make sure that you&rsquo;re expanding your point of view on whether or not a stock is worth buying</p>
<p>at the market price today. And I think having that broader perspective is what I see missing</p>
<p>in 99% of the chatter on Twitter, 99% of, you know, folks talking about what thing to buy,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re buying it. And I think it&rsquo;s critically important. You&rsquo;re saying that most investing</p>
<p>that you see, is very narrative driven. And that narrative can sometimes be so powerful,</p>
<p>that it overpowers all the other elements that one should be doing to get a full picture of why you</p>
<p>should be buying something is that I think that&rsquo;s a fair summary to math. Yeah, yeah. And I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s just about how so much of what goes on on CNBC, on a lot of Reddit</p>
<p>boards, not all of them, there&rsquo;s some very sophisticated folks, they&rsquo;re doing very sophisticated</p>
<p>financial analysis and looking at all the angles of a stock assessing the valuation. But so much</p>
<p>of these conversations exclude what you&rsquo;re paying and what you&rsquo;re getting, and exclude the broader</p>
<p>context of all the things that could and may not happen with a particular business. And as a result,</p>
<p>at some point, one of those things bonks you on the head, you lose 50%. And you&rsquo;re like, Oh, my gosh,</p>
<p>my sometimes. And sometimes if you try to inject that logic into those channels, you&rsquo;ll get</p>
<p>brigadooned. It&rsquo;ll be absolutely brigadooned. Brad, what do you what do you think, in terms of</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s access to markets, I guess would be another way to look at this and people&rsquo;s propensity</p>
<p>to just, you know, gamble, let&rsquo;s call it or maybe not make thoughtful decisions. I kind of think if</p>
<p>our friend Bill Gurley was here, he&rsquo;d be like, this is a five minute conversation about the</p>
<p>statement of the fucking obvious. Yeah, you know, this is stock picking is hard. Really? Is that the</p>
<p>theme of this section? Yeah. Stock picking is hard. Very little alpha has ever been generated</p>
<p>in a sustainable way, even by the greatest people of all time. I think, you know, maybe something</p>
<p>that is a little bit useful to add two things. Not all good companies are good investments.</p>
<p>Price of entry matters. Okay, so I hear a lot of people saying, well, I&rsquo;m gonna buy that because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a good company that I don&rsquo;t even know what that means. Right? Exactly. Right. Good, good,</p>
<p>good relative to the price of entry. But the second thing is the single greatest power</p>
<p>we have as investors, the greatest single source of alpha, right? Other than stock selection. So</p>
<p>choosing the right company, time arbitrage. Okay, so do you have the ability to own something that</p>
<p>is a growing asset over a long period of time so that if you got number one wrong, you bought it</p>
<p>at the wrong time, shit happened in the world, they miss a quarter, et cetera, that you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>forced to lock in those losses because you over allocated to that. So this idea around portfolio</p>
<p>management is a principal component of overall stock picking is just absolutely critical.</p>
<p>So I think, you know, I don&rsquo;t really, I love the fact I put myself through college,</p>
<p>I put myself through law school, through business school, day trading stocks out of the back of the</p>
<p>classroom. I&rsquo;m grateful I live in a country that let me feel like I had some alpha and that I</p>
<p>could do that. And I could go read the newspaper and sort it out. And I wasn&rsquo;t building sophisticated</p>
<p>financial models. So like, you know, I think there are ways that folks can do this. There are a lot</p>
<p>more ways to lose money than there are to make money in a sustainable and durable way. Right.</p>
<p>And so as an investor, what we try to do, you know, we&rsquo;ve got 90% of our portfolio in our top</p>
<p>five or 10 companies. I&rsquo;m not an index. And the deal I have with our LPs is I&rsquo;m very transparent</p>
<p>with them. They know that we&rsquo;re going to own companies in size. And it&rsquo;s that portfolio</p>
<p>concentration and our time arbitrage, holding companies for three years or longer, that is a</p>
<p>strategy they choose to believe in and sign up to. But I know a lot of greats who would never</p>
<p>subscribe to that strategy. So know your strategy, execute it, allocate a reasonable amount of</p>
<p>capital. So when all of these unknowns that Freeberg talks about come along, you can react</p>
<p>accordingly. And the final thing is, if it&rsquo;s not fun for you, right, like, if you&rsquo;re actually not</p>
<p>passionate and curious about like studying this stuff and learning about it, not everybody is,</p>
<p>then don&rsquo;t do it. Right, then don&rsquo;t do it, then just put your money in.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna be good at it.</p>
<p>The analytical depth and rigor that the greats employ to be successful at picking stocks and</p>
<p>picking businesses and investing in them, and selling them at the right time over time,</p>
<p>is does not make for good TikTok content. It does not make for good short form content.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve seen this dumbing down and this kind of short form thesis driven</p>
<p>narrative approach to content creation around markets and stocks, that ends up causing a lot</p>
<p>of people a lot of harm. You know, you watch the Jim Cramers of the world, I don&rsquo;t mean to</p>
<p>disparage any one individual, but that sort of content that&rsquo;s like, this is a great company,</p>
<p>we should buy it, like, let&rsquo;s go. And the depth and rigor takes a lot of time and a lot of effort</p>
<p>to really do right. And then you get hit in the head, you know, when we and that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve observed lately, and in a really kind of flurried way, particularly across social media,</p>
<p>and so on. That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s why I just wanted to talk about this topic today.</p>
<p>Just to build on top of what you&rsquo;re saying, Warren Buffett made this very famous bet in 2000.</p>
<p>It was him versus a bunch of hedge fund managers, and they were able to pick a basket of hedge funds.</p>
<p>And he said, I&rsquo;m not even gonna pick myself, I&rsquo;m going to pick the S&amp;P 500. And the low cost ETF,</p>
<p>the Vanguard ETF, and he said, we&rsquo;ll check in like 20 years later. Anyways, you know, the punchline</p>
<p>of the story, Buffett one, he won like a million bucks that he donated to charity, and these hedge</p>
<p>fund folks lost. And so to build on your point, Jason, time and time again, the smartest investors</p>
<p>in the world, ie guys like him have shown us that the most predictable way to make money,</p>
<p>if that is your goal is to own the S&amp;P 500, which is, you know, a dynamic index of the 500 best</p>
<p>companies in the world. So there are these people doing all the hard work for you. And they have</p>
<p>very strict criteria of who&rsquo;s an S&amp;P 500 company or not. Now, yes, if you cherry pick other companies</p>
<p>that are not, or you concentrate in some, will you generate better returns? Absolutely. But</p>
<p>systematically, over time, that thing has lurched forward at 8% a year, you know, 9% a year,</p>
<p>if you invest dividends, you can approach 10% a year. And so if, if you really want to just grow</p>
<p>your wealth, that&rsquo;s a very simple, steady, eddy way to do it. And to take a small amount and then</p>
<p>go and, you know, experiment with it to learn makes sense. But I think it&rsquo;s important to make</p>
<p>sure you&rsquo;re going there eyes wide open to try to actually learn. Buffett, of course, says the index</p>
<p>works really well. But then he&rsquo;s got 50% of his public portfolio in Apple over the last few years.</p>
<p>So he clearly believes in alpha as well. But you know, back to Friedberg&rsquo;s point, since we brought</p>
<p>up Buffett, you know, somebody asked Munger, why can&rsquo;t why can&rsquo;t people just copy what Buffett does?</p>
<p>And he said, because nobody likes to get rich slow. Nobody likes to get rich slow. If you want</p>
<p>to what it is 0% rate environment remind us all over the course of the last few years,</p>
<p>everybody had a grift, everybody had to get rich quick scheme. I don&rsquo;t care whether it was NFT</p>
<p>crypto flipping, or whether it was house flipping, or whatever it was, everybody thought, you know,</p>
<p>this was easy. And frankly, looked at guys like us, oftentimes, I said, you&rsquo;re the dumb ones.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re playing the game that&rsquo;s really hard. Why don&rsquo;t you just, you know, flip some crypto. And</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re back to a world that if you really want to, you know, by the way, yourself,</p>
<p>how dumb did you feel? I felt so stupid, all these tokens, minting, minting, billionaire,</p>
<p>billionaire, billionaire, billionaire, billionaire. And I just, I just sat on the sideline.</p>
<p>To your point, right? It just made you it made me feel so stupid.</p>
<p>I felt super nice. It&rsquo;s like, I what who&rsquo;s the customer? And how much do you charge him? And</p>
<p>when you can&rsquo;t get that basic answer of who the customer is, and how much it costs for them to</p>
<p>buy the product or service, it was like Brad&rsquo;s the Brad&rsquo;s point, I think the punchline is,</p>
<p>and then you know, at the 11th hour, it&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s a tendency to just capitulate and say,</p>
<p>okay, forget it, I&rsquo;m in. And that&rsquo;s when all the money gets torched real quick.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a proposition here in California, where we vote on specific ballot measures. Not every</p>
<p>state has this, but we have prop 30 coming out, this is a 1.75% tax on income earned incomes</p>
<p>earned over 2 million for the next 20 years in California, which by the way, had $100 billion</p>
<p>surplus that would go towards clean energy. This was proposed originally by environmental groups,</p>
<p>but Newsom has come out to battle against this, which would seem counter intuitive,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s so pro environment, what this would do is spend about 80% of this 100 billion in new</p>
<p>tax revenue over the next 20 years, 80% would go towards charging stations for EVs and motivating</p>
<p>customers to buy EVs 20% would go tour to combat the crazy amount of wildfires we&rsquo;re having here.</p>
<p>He Gavin Newsom that is called this a cynical scheme devised by a single corporation lift</p>
<p>to funnel state income tax revenue to their company lift has provided almost all of the 40</p>
<p>almost 48 million in funding for this prop 30. And the reason is because California is going to</p>
<p>require 90% of ride sharing miles to be traveled by zero emission vehicles in 2030. You know,</p>
<p>on top of that, that California is going to not let you sell anything other than EVs in 2035.</p>
<p>If this continues, now you&rsquo;ve got a bunch of people on the other side of this doing anti prop</p>
<p>30, including the California Teachers Association because they want the money.</p>
<p>Reed Hastings over at Netflix, Moritz over at Sequoia, Sam Altman over at open AI.</p>
<p>Well, what do you think of this? Freeberg? I&rsquo;m curious. Sorry, what side are they on Jacob?</p>
<p>The side of lift Altman? No, they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re saying don&rsquo;t do this because they are trying</p>
<p>to control taxes in Carolina. They&rsquo;re on Newsom side, Newsom side. Hey, this is a grift by lift,</p>
<p>because lift is concerned that they&rsquo;re going to have to, you know, bear the brunt of 90%</p>
<p>of miles. So I guess the I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s original sin, but the the one of the levers here</p>
<p>is lift is got the majority of their rides are in California. Uber has stayed out of this because</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have as much exposure because the number of rides in California is a smaller</p>
<p>percentage of their overall revenue. Brad, Brad, you have some thoughts to hear. I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a free burger, Brad. I&rsquo;m just looking at the board of directors and left and thinking to</p>
<p>myself, good God, what are these people thinking? Spending 40 to 50 million dollars on this. It</p>
<p>just seems that they&rsquo;ve totally lost the script. The company has way bigger problems, way bigger</p>
<p>problems to focus on. Right. Then, you know, this measure have a little faith in the system that</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t get to a place where this is reasonably practical over the next 10 years,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m sure we will evolve. Right. The legislation around this, you know, kudos to</p>
<p>Dar and the team at Uber for not running scared on this. Right. For not trying to push this through</p>
<p>these corporate governance initiatives guised as referendums in this state. I mean, this is just</p>
<p>bad politics, bad policy. I mean, we got Valerie Jarrett on the board of this company. You got</p>
<p>political sophistication on the board of this company. I want to be I wish I was a fly on the</p>
<p>wall. I want to know the conversation that went down and who raised their hand and said this is</p>
<p>the highest and best use of $40 million of our money. Crazy. Yeah, right. It makes no sense.</p>
<p>Freeberg have thoughts on if I mean, you&rsquo;ve talked before about how you think the free</p>
<p>market should solve. What is the what is the governance structure at lift guys?</p>
<p>I knew that was coming. I knew it was coming.</p>
<p>Did they have super voting shares? Anybody look? I don&rsquo;t know the answer to that.</p>
<p>So I think that the tax rate in California is high enough now that we all have friends,</p>
<p>friends in our poker group who have left for the state of Texas or the state of Florida,</p>
<p>where there are lower tax rates and where they feel like they&rsquo;re getting more value</p>
<p>for their tax dollars. There&rsquo;s certainly a calculus going on with Newsom, I believe in,</p>
<p>you know, the impact that having higher tax rates would have on what is clearly not just a</p>
<p>theoretical, but an actual evidenced, you know, exodus from the state of wealthy and high income</p>
<p>earners. This could be like, you know, at some point, there&rsquo;s a tipping point that looks a lot</p>
<p>like France, where you raise the rates high enough enough wealthy people leave and the net</p>
<p>tax dollars actually go down, like what happened in France when they introduced their wealth tax,</p>
<p>then they reversed it and everyone came back. I will say I don&rsquo;t more important long term point,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see a world where we don&rsquo;t have over 60% tax rates on the wealthiest people in this country</p>
<p>at a federal level. If you look at if you assume a 5% long range, call it 1520 year horizon for</p>
<p>for interest rates, even 4% on $30 trillion of outstanding debt. And you assume that the</p>
<p>voter base will never vote to reduce Social Security or Medicare entitlement programs.</p>
<p>And obviously, the defense budget won&rsquo;t get cut, we are not going to see a situation in this</p>
<p>country on a federal basis, where we can actually meet all of our fiscal obligations</p>
<p>without incremental tax revenue. And I think it is much more likely that you know, look,</p>
<p>whatever happens with the state initiative happens. But I think it&rsquo;s very likely that over</p>
<p>time, the only way for the United States to bridge its fiscal gap is going to be to raise income</p>
<p>to increase the tax rates. I don&rsquo;t see another solution because I don&rsquo;t think that the federal</p>
<p>government or in our kind of democratically elected Congress, we&rsquo;re going to see a system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to say, hey, let&rsquo;s go for austerity measures, let&rsquo;s reduce entitlement programs,</p>
<p>both sides will say that it&rsquo;s just not going to happen. So tax rates, higher tax rates,</p>
<p>I think are coming. Well, you know, maybe California will skip over this particular</p>
<p>generation. But I don&rsquo;t see how the United States continues to thrive over the next 15 to 20 years</p>
<p>without tax rates that will today seem exorbitant. Well, in the last 20 years, we blew through</p>
<p>a debt to GDP that was I think, 57%. And it basically doubled. And so David, to your point,</p>
<p>when we wanted to feel prosperous, what we did was we financed it. We went out and we, you know,</p>
<p>put out a ton of debt in order to make sure that our entitlement spending or defense spending or</p>
<p>whatever the things were that we needed as a population to feel like we were growing and</p>
<p>moving forward as a society we had. So that is the practical nature of what happens. And look,</p>
<p>a lot of people think that there is some upper bound to debt to GDP. And I&rsquo;m actually of the</p>
<p>opposite view, which is I think that, you know, the quote unquote, invisible hand justifies us</p>
<p>moving debt to GDP to higher and higher rates. So the first time the United States went past 100%,</p>
<p>we thought it was the end of the world, it turned out it wasn&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;ll eventually go past 200,</p>
<p>somebody will clamor and, you know, be anxiety riddled, but they&rsquo;ll take some SSRIs,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll be okay, we&rsquo;ll keep moving forward. Then we&rsquo;ll get to 300%, we&rsquo;ll keep moving forward. So</p>
<p>we are in a debt spiral that is a feature, not a bug of how democratic societies work.</p>
<p>As a companion to that, I do agree with you that taxation kind of is a pendulum, it,</p>
<p>it ebbs and flows. And you know, we&rsquo;re in the part where it&rsquo;s going to go higher before it goes</p>
<p>lower. But I want to tell you a story, which is that in the beginning of this summer, or sorry,</p>
<p>this fall, I was in the Middle East, and then I was in Asia. And they have very different</p>
<p>taxation schemes, right. And many of them have zero corporate gains tax, and, you know, sometimes</p>
<p>zero income tax. But then the opportunities for them to be able to invest and drive returns</p>
<p>is also commensurately lower, meaning there&rsquo;s not as much alpha in most of the opportunities that</p>
<p>they see. Whereas if you go to California, you have to pay 60% tax, but then you know,</p>
<p>you could be an angel investor in Uber, you know, and all of a sudden take 25,000 and turn it into</p>
<p>100 million, which is un ungodly, it&rsquo;s incredible. So I think that, in my opinion, actually, like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s actually this beautiful symmetry where even if taxes are high, your earnings potential</p>
<p>is commensurately higher, such that the net that you&rsquo;re left with is the same as if you were in</p>
<p>another place where taxes may be zero, but you&rsquo;re just not going to get exposed to the same ways to</p>
<p>make money. And I think obviously, there&rsquo;s corner cases where that&rsquo;s not true. But I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>sweating taxes is a really important waste. It&rsquo;s important way to spend somebody&rsquo;s time. I just</p>
<p>think it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Brad funnel work, I would just say, the beautiful thing about federalism</p>
<p>is we get to a B test in real time, different points of view. And so we&rsquo;re seeing the biggest</p>
<p>AB test, maybe in the history of federalism between the state of California, the state of</p>
<p>Texas and the state of Florida. And it&rsquo;s not just tax rates, right? When when Elon leaves to go to</p>
<p>Texas, we have the head of the California General Assembly, right changing her Twitter profile to</p>
<p>say good riddance and flipping the book flipping the bird to Elon, right? There is a hostility</p>
<p>toward business that has emerged in California that I think is commensurate and related to the</p>
<p>tax rate, but also separate. At the same time, we have the mayor of Miami texting us,</p>
<p>asking us to come down for a visit. We have friends in Texas who are literally politicians</p>
<p>who are marketing their state to people in California. And we&rsquo;re going to be able to</p>
<p>political scientists will look back in five or 10 years. And they&rsquo;ll be able to answer those</p>
<p>questions for you. But I suspect that that makes us a much stronger place for experimentation</p>
<p>than countries like France, where it&rsquo;s all or none.</p>
<p>And just to give people an idea to transport about point about debt to GDP. Here&rsquo;s the chart</p>
<p>early part of our lifetimes 50% 1990s 6070% after the Great Recession, the pandemic 120%</p>
<p>Japan&rsquo;s at 200%, I think. So there&rsquo;s obviously doesn&rsquo;t, it doesn&rsquo;t mean anything. I know that</p>
<p>your payments might at some point, yeah, I really don&rsquo;t think so. Because I think what will happen</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;ll just move the yield, you know, the yield to maturity will move out. And, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll issue again, you know, this is the funny thing. We talked about this last night at poker,</p>
<p>like, you know, Trump&rsquo;s ideas, some of them were actually very brilliant. They were just packaged</p>
<p>through this lens of being a total goofball. So you could take it seriously. But 100 year</p>
<p>bonds, when rates were zero, now looks like, oh my god, what a brilliant move.</p>
<p>I mean, if you could take a 50 year worldview about climate about nuclear energy about semis,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t get to semiconductors again this week, we got so much good stuff. But, you know, we do</p>
<p>need to take very long multi decade looks at investment. And so why not make a 25 or 50 year</p>
<p>bond for semiconductors? Can I actually just do a small PSA? Sure, quickly. Public Service</p>
<p>announcement from trauma, the more you know, go, I went to blue bottle coffee today, and I asked</p>
<p>for a latte. And they gave me a latte with oat milk. That&rsquo;s their default, which is disgusting.</p>
<p>And I find out, I find out that is now their default and brutal. And I said,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of normal people that don&rsquo;t want to ingest that chemical spew into their body.</p>
<p>And so this is just a shout out, like just a comment to blue bottle, like,</p>
<p>can you please realize that a lot of us are normal, we want to come to your store,</p>
<p>and then you know, not have to ask for the long tail alternative. Can you just serve the thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s first you&rsquo;re signaling it most of the people drink coffee shop? Yeah, most of the</p>
<p>people still drink milk. Okay, I&rsquo;m not trying to bring a doing you blue bottle, but I&rsquo;m not going</p>
<p>to go to you anymore as a customer because I find this stuff really dumb. Like, can you just have</p>
<p>milk so that I can ask for the oat milk if I want to versus giving me chemical stuff that I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want? I don&rsquo;t want that. Yeah, that&rsquo;s and and complaining about oat milk. Is that what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on? No, it&rsquo;s this is where this is where we are moment. It&rsquo;s just like, I just want milk. I want</p>
<p>a latte. I mean, I want to go and support you guys. I want to maybe maybe the cow doesn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to make that milk for you after its baby was ripped away from it. Oh, boy, here we go. You</p>
<p>know, here we go. It&rsquo;s a we and we survive 90 minutes. And here it comes point. You know,</p>
<p>did the cow agree to be in service to you to make your milk? You think I need to have a verbal</p>
<p>contract with cows? I mean, well, yeah, I mean, are we going to do the olive fed beef next week</p>
<p>or not? Let&rsquo;s just get down to translator of the cow human protocol. Who is it? You people? Is it</p>
<p>one of your friends? Like what? I don&rsquo;t know. Actually, I am working on a neural link. I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>sure that the default assumption that the cow should be there to do whatever you want it to do</p>
<p>is a fair assumption. I think that&rsquo;ll change over time, but it&rsquo;ll take some time.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s completely fair and reasonable. But what I&rsquo;m saying is right</p>
<p>now while there&rsquo;s an entire, you know, he said that economy of my well, there&rsquo;s an entire entire</p>
<p>economy of people that shouldn&rsquo;t get rolled over because you want to impute the emotions of cows.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m allowing you your freedom to want to impute those emotions of cows. Well, I would like to</p>
<p>support the dairy industry and buy milk. So can I please do that? No, I want to impute the freedom</p>
<p>and rights of the cows. But that&rsquo;s going to take some time. But sure, go ahead, have your milk for</p>
<p>now. And you&rsquo;re allowed but I right now will take the side of the dairy farmer. I just want to get</p>
<p>your chick Karen outrage your trim off Karen outrage or Karen on tape. Is this trending on</p>
<p>Tick Tock yet? When you admonished the barista? It&rsquo;s not his fault. I just think it&rsquo;s I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>make a scene or anything. I just got I tasted because I just said, Can I please have a latte,</p>
<p>assuming that it would come with milk like most most normal places? Yes. And now I have to actually</p>
<p>ask for milk because they think that this chemical composite stuff that&rsquo;s called Oh, have you looked</p>
<p>at the ingredients? And we had this conversation? Yes, we as anybody listen, we didn&rsquo;t even get to</p>
<p>MailChimp CEO, Ben chestnut, who is, you know, like one of the kind great CEOs of our generation.</p>
<p>Getting Yeah, his memo. Is his last name really chestnut? I believe it is. Yeah, it&rsquo;s just there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a tennis chess. That&rsquo;s a great guy. I met him so many times incredible human and he&rsquo;s been ousted.</p>
<p>Should we do outros? Because you didn&rsquo;t do intros? Jekyll? Did you have? All right,</p>
<p>so here&rsquo;s the actual Yeah, for for the Sultan of science, the Queen of quinoa himself,</p>
<p>climbing the stray cat leaderboard as we speak. David Friedberg, follow him on his Twitter handle</p>
<p>where you can get all kinds of hot takes from science to Ukraine. At Friedberg is talking about</p>
<p>I never tweet. I know that&rsquo;s the joke. Also with with us again, the anchor he&rsquo;ll be doing a Twitch</p>
<p>streaming where he translates the emotions I&rsquo;m actually doing various animals, my cooking show,</p>
<p>which has a base of oat milk. It&rsquo;s my oat milk top 10 beverages tonight on Twitch. Just follow</p>
<p>stray Friedberg. Get it. I don&rsquo;t want to get brigadooned by the oat milk lovers. But they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>coming. Milk stands are coming for you, man. You listen, I don&rsquo;t want that chemical stuff in my</p>
<p>body. But I&rsquo;m not going to stop you from doing it. I&rsquo;ll do a diatribe on chemicals in oat milk next</p>
<p>week. What should we drink? If you did have a choice? Friedberg? If you didn&rsquo;t want to drink</p>
<p>the chemicals and only what would you drink? What would you what do you drink? Soy milk,</p>
<p>oat milk, whatever. Okay. But you Okay, but you&rsquo;re okay. And bringing that namaste tasted milk.</p>
<p>I drink the beautiful glass jar. No, I&rsquo;m asking Friedberg stuff. Straw milk. Yes.</p>
<p>$3 returns for each glass bottle. I return them. I get them good. Have you tried? Have you tried?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what is going to happen in the next he&rsquo;s never had milk in the next 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p>Most of the milk you buy at the store will be identical to cow&rsquo;s milk, same protein composition,</p>
<p>it will be built in a slurry. I mean, you can make fun of it. But you do work in the tech industry.</p>
<p>But yeah, I mean, precision fermentation is the future of making animal proteins. And it is how</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna hide you Friedberg. I like it. It&rsquo;s telling you there is an economic model that will</p>
<p>work where we&rsquo;re gonna that&rsquo;s great. You know, but I&rsquo;m saying, but wait, between now and then</p>
<p>can I just two things. Number one is, there&rsquo;s a taste and a flavor profile I&rsquo;ve grown up with</p>
<p>that I would like and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m a bad person. So I just like to have that and not be</p>
<p>made to feel guilty about it. Okay. And, and and number two, I don&rsquo;t want to put chemicals in my</p>
<p>body. Okay. So if I can find a natural thing that I like, can I please just drink that? Can I just</p>
<p>please blue bottle have that in my coffee without having to explicitly ask for it? Yes, you will</p>
<p>get that. And number two bottles are short is owned by Nestle. And they&rsquo;re the largest dairy</p>
<p>but Chamath has still has a short on Oatly. So let&rsquo;s just keep this going for just two more</p>
<p>weeks. Okay, let me ask you an ethical moral question. It&rsquo;s not joking. He does not have a</p>
<p>short I don&rsquo;t even know if at least public. I&rsquo;d rather you ask me an ethical moral question than</p>
<p>a political one. So I&rsquo;m going to Yeah, I mean, we got a break from Ukraine this week. Would you</p>
<p>have if the synthetic version of milk or steak was made? Like and is a protein that is exactly</p>
<p>the same to a cow? Would you have a problem morally with eating and or drinking it?</p>
<p>No. So the objective of what&rsquo;s called precision fermentation, or some people call it</p>
<p>biomanufacturing, you take the DNA from the cow, or from the chicken, you put it in a yeast cell,</p>
<p>or a bacterial cell, and you put in a fermenter tank, you put sugar water in the tank,</p>
<p>and the yeast cell or bacterial cell eats that sugar water, and it spits out that protein.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;ve programmed that organism to make that protein. And instead of growing a whole cow</p>
<p>or growing a whole friggin chicken, you&rsquo;re growing the protein. No moral issue. No moral issue. No,</p>
<p>because no animal died in the making of the process. You know, you&rsquo;re not king.</p>
<p>Can I quote Dave Chappelle here? Go ahead. Yuck.</p>
<p>All right. It&rsquo;s gonna it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s identical to the protein you&rsquo;d be eating. Otherwise,</p>
<p>it tastes the same. It&rsquo;s the exact same compound. There&rsquo;s nothing about it that&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>Thanks to the dictator. Thanks to the salt of science. And for the fifth bestie coming in and</p>
<p>doing a great job today on behalf of our friend, the Sasol David Sachs, who is busy in a secret</p>
<p>clandestine peace-making junket to Ukraine. I am the world&rsquo;s greatest moderator, Jason</p>
<p>Kalkanis. We&rsquo;ll see you next time on All In. Love you, boys.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my dog taking a notice in your driveway.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they&rsquo;re all just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>What? You&rsquo;re a B.</p>
<p>What? You&rsquo;re a B.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a B.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
