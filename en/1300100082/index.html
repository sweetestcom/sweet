<p>i don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>utilized one of these masturbatory devices</p>
<p>no i haven&rsquo;t can i try that</p>
<p>during this interview sure sure touch</p>
<p>it is it a that&rsquo;s the butthole version</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the butthole</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t recommend you jump right into deep end</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like trying heroin before you try pot</p>
<p>yeah but it&rsquo;s tighter</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s well yeah but i usually</p>
<p>with a butthole i like</p>
<p>i like someone to apologize to</p>
<p>so i don&rsquo;t know if this is really</p>
<p>good for me</p>
<p>yeah it might</p>
<p>develop some bad social habits just</p>
<p>force yourself on it just</p>
<p>baby i know baby just let me get through this</p>
<p>what a terrible</p>
<p>terrible thing</p>
<p>what is that what is the</p>
<p>instinct that i don&rsquo;t know but anal sex is so popular</p>
<p>with the young people</p>
<p>these days i</p>
<p>think that is because of the porn</p>
<p>i think the porn has fucked the kids heads up i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s two</p>
<p>things is the porn and it&rsquo;s the bush administration</p>
<p>really because</p>
<p>there was actually this study</p>
<p>done they said like</p>
<p>eight years of</p>
<p>of abstinence</p>
<p>only education in the us they got rid of anything</p>
<p>other than abstinence only education</p>
<p>in the schools</p>
<p>so all these kids have</p>
<p>grown up thinking</p>
<p>alright well if they take it in the ass they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still virgins</p>
<p>whoa really</p>
<p>yeah so all</p>
<p>these like christian kids in the</p>
<p>bible belt are all having anal sex</p>
<p>because of this it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s blowback it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>unintentional blowback there was</p>
<p>always a few girls like that when we were young that</p>
<p>did you know</p>
<p>think that they were</p>
<p>still virgins if they took</p>
<p>in the ass there was like one or two girls that you had</p>
<p>heard about but they were always like a joke yeah i</p>
<p>never i never met a girl</p>
<p>in you know before both my two</p>
<p>marriages not</p>
<p>until after not till i became single</p>
<p>again this third time</p>
<p>have i ever met girls that that</p>
<p>that were into anal sex really</p>
<p>ever you can find them</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re out there i know but i you know</p>
<p>people that are allergic to peanut butter</p>

<p>yeah but you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna meet them</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna meet them yeah</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re out there on the hunt</p>
<p>yes if you&rsquo;re out there getting</p>
<p>crazy looking to</p>
<p>stick things in people&rsquo;s butts</p>

<p>i love fucking me some peanut allergy people yeah</p>
<p>yeah they don&rsquo;t have a lot of resistance no no</p>
<p>they give up easy mmm hmm</p>
<p>so um dave and i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>known each other</p>
<p>since 1994 when i</p>
<p>first started doing</p>
<p>when i first started acting really</p>
<p>news radio was one of the</p>
<p>first acting things i&rsquo;d ever done</p>
<p>we had done one of the sitcom before that yeah your</p>
<p>own did this</p>
<p>thing cardboard balls</p>
<p>yeah absolutely terrible</p>
<p>terrible and</p>
<p>i think terrible</p>
<p>is a good good</p>
<p>word you invented</p>
<p>yeah you should</p>
<p>throw a couple</p>
<p>other fs in there yeah</p>
<p>it was you and mike starr</p>
<p>right yeah and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another guy</p>
<p>bruce guy i</p>
<p>think his name is</p>
<p>greenwood he&rsquo;s always in a bun he was like in star trek</p>
<p>he played captain</p>
<p>kirk&rsquo;s dad you know he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s always doing a</p>
<p>bunch of different</p>
<p>things there&rsquo;s a few</p>
<p>an alley god</p>
<p>was her name</p>
<p>oh fuck i forgot her name</p>
<p>but she&rsquo;s married to</p>
<p>george stephanopoulos</p>
<p>oh yeah i know i know</p>
<p>what you mean</p>
<p>yeah i know what you mean very nice</p>
<p>girl i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>remember her name either alexandra wentworth yes</p>
<p>and yeah it was a terrible show it was really</p>
<p>funny premise and it was written by</p>
<p>these guys who</p>
<p>had written the simpsons and they worked on</p>
<p>married with children</p>
<p>kevin kern and jeff martin really</p>
<p>funny guys but they were very much writers</p>
<p>they were very</p>
<p>quiet guys they were a little socially awkward</p>
<p>and the network just did not</p>
<p>think that they</p>
<p>would be able to handle</p>
<p>producing a show</p>
<p>so they brought in this</p>
<p>ultimate hack</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t even remember</p>
<p>his name was bill something or another but he was death</p>
<p>every joke was</p>
<p>death all of his</p>
<p>instincts were terrible it was just the</p>
<p>worst most hacky shit the guy had</p>
<p>never said a</p>
<p>funny thing in his life</p>
<p>so i got to see the worst</p>
<p>aspect of hollywood</p>
<p>and then i was totally</p>
<p>ready to bail</p>
<p>and go back to new york and just go back to doing</p>
<p>stand up but unfortunately i&rsquo;d</p>
<p>leased a fucking apartment</p>
<p>because i was convinced this show was</p>
<p>gonna be successful like</p>
<p>every idiot yeah</p>
<p>so i stayed around and then next</p>
<p>thing you know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m saying news</p>
<p>radio literally</p>
<p>thanks to ray</p>
<p>romano being</p>
<p>fired in rehearsals yeah</p>
<p>so what was that like you were there in the</p>
<p>pilot i was not</p>
<p>what just didn&rsquo;t work out was just the</p>
<p>wrong character it was weird</p>
<p>i mean cause i</p>
<p>guess ray knew</p>
<p>things weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>going well i didn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>perceive that he was having any real problems you know</p>
<p>except but he he</p>
<p>would get break</p>
<p>would come up to me like</p>
<p>he man you gotta help me out here you kind of</p>
<p>know i got i</p>
<p>gotta get a joke in here i gotta</p>
<p>i gotta make this</p>
<p>funny somehow</p>
<p>maybe it was just a stench</p>
<p>of nervousness yeah he was like</p>
<p>i panicked i</p>
<p>guess he was</p>
<p>you know and then</p>
<p>knows then i</p>
<p>got the call yeah i got that call from paul</p>
<p>you know saying oh</p>
<p>well we&rsquo;re gonna let ray go and well</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ray though all the time</p>
<p>thinking that something&rsquo;s going terrible</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s like one of those guys</p>
<p>always thinks that</p>
<p>things are going wrong there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>recent he did an interview on the</p>
<p>green room that paul prevents a show</p>
<p>oh yeah where he said that</p>
<p>still to this day he goes on</p>
<p>stage and the audience cheers and he feels like a fraud</p>
<p>you know he steps out there they love him you</p>
<p>know fucking ten years of a</p>
<p>great sitcom a</p>
<p>great stand up</p>
<p>comic all these people love him</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like girl</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t even like me this is fake</p>
<p>he gets out there and he just weirds out</p>
<p>weirds out the fact that all</p>
<p>these people actually like him</p>
<p>you know and then there was the guy that did</p>
<p>the part during the pilot and then just</p>
<p>that was it for him they just didn&rsquo;t use him</p>
<p>after that yeah</p>
<p>i forget his name now bill</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t even think they considered this poor fuck</p>
<p>no he was just there as an</p>
<p>interim filler yeah</p>
<p>which is horrible</p>
<p>his position to be in</p>
<p>yeah so i was in my</p>
<p>apartment and i had a deal</p>
<p>with nbc some sort of a development deal</p>
<p>and they said well there&rsquo;s a show that we</p>
<p>would like you to read for if you&rsquo;re interested</p>
<p>and then they gave me the tape</p>
<p>and i remember</p>
<p>thinking holy shit this is fucking good like</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>way i can get on the show like this is like a real show</p>
<p>like the other hardball show at</p>
<p>least it sort of made sense</p>
<p>like why did they</p>
<p>picked me with zero acting ever</p>
<p>to be on this sitcom oh because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>idiots and they don&rsquo;t know what the fuck to doing</p>
<p>you know but all the</p>
<p>sudden this</p>
<p>was like this real npc show and i was like holy shit</p>
<p>you know i can</p>
<p>still remember being there on the</p>
<p>first day of set and like that i&rsquo;m fucking sitting</p>
<p>right next to phil hartman like how</p>
<p>weird is this</p>
<p>you know i mean i</p>
<p>literally had</p>
<p>when i got my</p>
<p>development deal they made me take some acting</p>
<p>classes so i took some one on one acting</p>
<p>classes with some</p>
<p>crazy failed actress</p>
<p>woman in new york who was</p>
<p>unbelievably bitter</p>
<p>yeah you know and play like weird</p>
<p>psychological games with you they won&rsquo;t give your</p>
<p>teaching certificate</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re unbelievably bitter i think</p>
<p>she was brutal</p>
<p>and then she was trying to</p>
<p>angle a job she kept trying to</p>
<p>angle a job to play my mother</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s a mom in this fucking</p>
<p>script you know</p>
<p>crazy bitch well if there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>thing that comes up to play your mom you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna use right</p>
<p>oh god yeah</p>
<p>and all of a</p>
<p>sudden we&rsquo;re on news</p>
<p>radio it&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>yeah yeah that was</p>
<p>because we had well we had a different because it was</p>
<p>the joe character was different and also the catherine</p>
<p>character was</p>
<p>different different actor playing catherine</p>
<p>oh we all that too</p>
<p>yeah so you forgot</p>
<p>about that you and</p>
<p>candy both came in</p>
<p>at the same time wow that&rsquo;s crazy yeah</p>
<p>i just ran out of</p>
<p>candy recently at the airport she</p>

<p>she&rsquo;s famous for leaving shows</p>
<p>yeah she is gorgeous</p>
<p>yeah she&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s a wild bitch</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>candy alexander is awesome i love her but she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>legitimately wild like</p>
<p>she doesn&rsquo;t take any shit</p>
<p>she quit news</p>
<p>radio because</p>
<p>she wasn&rsquo;t getting enough jokes</p>
<p>i mean she just decided there&rsquo;s a tv show</p>
<p>in the air and it&rsquo;s doing really well and she&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>you know some</p>
<p>silly amount of money</p>
<p>every week and she&rsquo;s like no</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not they&rsquo;re not appreciating me i&rsquo;m gone yeah</p>
<p>and the writers were</p>
<p>completely in denial</p>
<p>about it it was the weirdest</p>
<p>thing you know when it came up</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re like well that&rsquo;s not true</p>
<p>right like what</p>
<p>the fuck are you talking</p>
<p>about man yeah</p>
<p>no a bunch of</p>
<p>white guys from harvard</p>
<p>were not able to</p>
<p>write for a</p>
<p>black woman a black</p>
<p>woman well it didn&rsquo;t even seem like</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s almost seemed like they just didn&rsquo;t bother</p>
<p>yeah they didn&rsquo;t even try</p>
<p>it just you know</p>
<p>they had her there and if it fit in they</p>
<p>could use her but</p>
<p>occasionally they put the word</p>
<p>honey at the</p>
<p>start of a sentence</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re on a show and there&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>eight people</p>
<p>sitcom is such a weird environment you know and</p>
<p>eight people are struggling to get their own little</p>
<p>thing in you know yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a weird little tense environment</p>
<p>yeah it could be very strange and for her i</p>
<p>guess it was just</p>
<p>disappointing over and over and over again yeah</p>
<p>a lot of people who like that show</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know this and this is</p>
<p>a very odd part in history but dave foley literally</p>
<p>wrote half of that show</p>
<p>and half of it on the set</p>
<p>like you were</p>
<p>like an uncredited producer</p>
<p>i mean it would have</p>
<p>never worked the way it worked without you</p>
<p>wow i guess it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll say it&rsquo;s a generous over overstatement i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it is i really don&rsquo;t you went over</p>
<p>every scene</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t just rehearse the scene</p>
<p>you went over every scene and you went over the beats</p>
<p>and you came up with alternatives</p>
<p>every single time i mean i don&rsquo;t think we ever</p>
<p>unless the scene was absolutely perfect</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think there was ever a time</p>
<p>where we didn&rsquo;t dabble with things</p>
<p>yeah i know we all and</p>
<p>again i can</p>
<p>say everyone did i mean a lot of it was i mean</p>
<p>a lot of the cast you had</p>
<p>you and me and phil and andy</p>
<p>were all used to creating</p>
<p>their own stuff</p>
<p>right so we i</p>
<p>think everyone came into it with that</p>
<p>the ability to</p>
<p>to think on</p>
<p>their feet and change</p>
<p>stuff it was amazing that paul let us</p>
<p>as much as he did</p>
<p>yeah you know he</p>
<p>paul sims who</p>
<p>was a producer of it who also worked on the</p>
<p>larry sander show before that was</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>young guy at the time and just really bright and really</p>
<p>great writer a</p>
<p>great writer and</p>
<p>and just knew</p>
<p>that you know</p>
<p>we could fuck around and make</p>
<p>different things up and</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>on the set and you&rsquo;re acting it out sometimes it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t come off as the same</p>
<p>as it is on a written page and sometimes there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>obvious or not so obvious alternative</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just amazing that he let us do it</p>
<p>yeah well they let</p>
<p>us because yeah we&rsquo;d rework</p>
<p>stuff during rehearsals and find different</p>
<p>things we thought were funnier</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d run it for paul and the</p>
<p>other writers</p>
<p>at the end of the day and if they liked it</p>
<p>it would show up in the</p>
<p>script the next day yeah</p>
<p>it seemed like both of your characters were pretty much</p>
<p>really well written for you guys because</p>
<p>like you two at</p>
<p>least i know</p>
<p>phil hartman</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t really seem like that you know in real life i</p>
<p>would imagine but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s seemed like you were you and you were you</p>
<p>on that show</p>
<p>which sort of</p>
<p>i mean dave was more innocent and i was more retarded</p>
<p>yeah yeah but you had your theories</p>
<p>and stuff like that well they</p>
<p>incorporated</p>
<p>aspects of our</p>
<p>personalities</p>
<p>definitely i mean</p>
<p>i mean i was</p>
<p>dave nelson&rsquo;s probably a real mix of me and phil</p>
<p>me and phil</p>
<p>me and paul sims</p>
<p>you know so be</p>
<p>depending on</p>
<p>who the writers felt like mocking more that day</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>yeah yeah i was</p>
<p>just a more retarded version of me with special gifts</p>
<p>that i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>possess yes</p>
<p>yeah you were yeah you were</p>
<p>a conspiracy theorist with a bit of the fawns yeah</p>
<p>it was a fun gig though a lot of fun</p>
<p>the last year was odd as fuck</p>
<p>yeah but other than that it was it was a lot</p>
<p>of fun yeah</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m glad we did the last year because i</p>
<p>would have hated to not see everyone that yeah</p>
<p>that would have been terrified</p>
<p>yeah i always assumed we</p>
<p>would be hanging out all the time from now on from that</p>
<p>point on but it really didn&rsquo;t work out that way</p>
<p>no no it never does you know</p>
<p>no yeah it&rsquo;s true cause everybody goes in</p>
<p>such different directions yeah i ran into maura once or</p>
<p>twice i know i ran into her once we had a good time at</p>
<p>one of those nbc functions</p>
<p>yeah and i was on</p>
<p>a news radio</p>
<p>or fear factor and she was on</p>
<p>er and we got drunk together it was a great time</p>
<p>yeah it was like the old days yeah reminded me</p>
<p>ours always fun to get drunk</p>
<p>oh yeah she&rsquo;s one of the best ever you know</p>
<p>she was the one who convinced me to kick in the</p>
<p>craft service door</p>
<p>because we were all hungry</p>
<p>yeah we had some good times on that set</p>
<p>after the set</p>
<p>after filming we would basically just</p>
<p>drink all night you know</p>
<p>that filming would be done at whatever and</p>
<p>we all have our mini fridges</p>
<p>stocked in our</p>
<p>guest rooms</p>
<p>coolers and we just get hammered</p>
<p>and just shoot the shit and have fun and</p>
<p>laugh and go over dave&rsquo;s room and listen to some</p>
<p>weird music</p>
<p>a voice had some weird chicks that made you</p>
<p>wanna cry playing</p>
<p>a few of them that you dated</p>
<p>yeah just you know strange</p>
<p>somber women</p>
<p>voices mm hmm</p>
<p>and and then we yeah somebody</p>
<p>would be there till it was time to go to denny&rsquo;s yeah</p>
<p>right or we would go to</p>
<p>down the street when we were at</p>
<p>sunset gower we would go down to that bar and</p>
<p>what was it</p>
<p>called there was like a like an industry bar like</p>
<p>really catered to people that were leaving the set oh</p>
<p>well right next to the next door</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>it was pinot was that what it was yeah</p>
<p>used to be a bar and</p>
<p>grill yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>yeah be like</p>
<p>all the people from fraser</p>
<p>and that was</p>
<p>weird to be there yeah we</p>
<p>go and it would be</p>
<p>stiff as fuck we</p>
<p>would be hammered</p>
<p>and they would be all</p>
<p>still like doing</p>
<p>their actor</p>
<p>thing you know i thought it was a</p>
<p>marvelous performance i</p>
<p>think he was</p>
<p>quite lovely</p>
<p>did you know that it&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>broadway now oh</p>
<p>amazing i&rsquo;ve got to see it</p>
<p>you know they were just all</p>
<p>completely full of shit</p>
<p>and and he would</p>
<p>come in trying to grab everybody&rsquo;s dick and you know</p>
<p>dave and i would be hammered more be</p>
<p>hammered yeah</p>
<p>julie bean and</p>
<p>julie b yeah we&rsquo;d all be</p>
<p>laughing and joking around</p>
<p>yeah it was a great</p>
<p>great group of humans</p>
<p>it was one of</p>
<p>the most fun times of my entire life those</p>
<p>it was amazing there was one time i remember we were</p>
<p>about to go</p>
<p>and do it there</p>
<p>was a live audience there and everybody was getting</p>
<p>ready and we were</p>
<p>standing in that little back hallway</p>
<p>where they would introduce us</p>
<p>and i said you know</p>
<p>that this is</p>
<p>gonna be one of</p>
<p>those days where we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna look back</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re older and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go i can&rsquo;t believe i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>enjoy this more</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t believe i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>appreciate how</p>
<p>crazy this is more yeah</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>what a random</p>
<p>stroke of luck</p>
<p>it is to get so many cool people all together in one</p>
<p>group yeah the fact that yeah we all wanted to</p>
<p>spend time together</p>
<p>like when work was done nobody</p>
<p>wanted to go everyone wanted to stay</p>
<p>we all had fun</p>
<p>it was a really</p>
<p>weird environment it was a</p>
<p>weird environment too creatively</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so rare that a sitcom works</p>
<p>yeah you know i&rsquo;ve been given</p>
<p>scripts to sitcoms and</p>
<p>fuck i couldn&rsquo;t get into them i</p>
<p>fucked up at some recent audition</p>
<p>about a year ago i</p>
<p>guess it was</p>
<p>i just i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even i read it a little bit and then i looked at</p>
<p>him like what the fuck am i</p>
<p>gonna do with this you know it&rsquo;s just yeah</p>
<p>you just you feel like</p>
<p>like you were there when</p>
<p>lightning hit the ground you know you don&rsquo;t want to be</p>
<p>you know you know yeah</p>
<p>well with that it was like we were</p>
<p>from the very</p>
<p>first time i</p>
<p>think we were all together on</p>
<p>state it felt like</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been there for years</p>
<p>yeah like it felt like a</p>
<p>group of people have been working together for</p>
<p>for a long time</p>
<p>it was so weird it was such a</p>
<p>weird environment such a</p>
<p>weird experience for me</p>
<p>yeah like i said i had no acting</p>
<p>experience nor aspirations to act</p>
<p>yeah it was</p>
<p>strictly by greed</p>
<p>alone that i</p>
<p>wound up in hollywood because they offered me all this</p>
<p>money to be on a sitcom i was like</p>
<p>fuck really</p>
<p>and all of a</p>
<p>sudden i&rsquo;m here and then</p>
<p>literally less than you know six</p>
<p>months after that show was canceled i&rsquo;m on this radio</p>
<p>yeah it was so bizarre</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t you kind</p>
<p>of have the same kind of like thrown into it</p>
<p>you were young when you</p>
<p>started kids in the hall</p>
<p>you i was 20 well i was</p>
<p>i was 19 when i</p>
<p>started working with</p>
<p>kevin mcdonald</p>
<p>wow but i was 20 i was 25 when the series</p>
<p>started were you a</p>
<p>comic before or were you doing any kind of improv</p>
<p>before yeah well i</p>
<p>started doing i</p>
<p>quit high school and</p>
<p>started doing</p>
<p>stand up when i was like 17 wow</p>
<p>and then how long did you do it for</p>
<p>just for like just</p>
<p>not even two years</p>
<p>about a year and a half i quit when i was</p>
<p>just around my nineteenth birthday and</p>
<p>that is exactly when you were getting into kids at all</p>
<p>yeah i quit</p>
<p>after when i met</p>
<p>kevin mcdonald and</p>
<p>started doing</p>
<p>stuff with him i stopped doing</p>
<p>stand up so just</p>
<p>focused all your time on sketches and</p>
<p>stuff yeah yeah we&rsquo;re doing i joined his improv group</p>
<p>um and then</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re like well theater</p>
<p>sports and it&rsquo;s taken like</p>
<p>second city workshops and</p>
<p>you know that led pretty</p>
<p>i guess fairly</p>
<p>quickly like within a few years to the</p>
<p>the whole the five men</p>
<p>version of the kids in the hall</p>
<p>that became the tv show</p>
<p>but which they played</p>
<p>non stop in the united</p>
<p>states on comedy central all</p>
<p>the time back in the day yeah</p>
<p>i think we were all they had for a while yeah</p>
<p>that weekend at bernie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that was pre south park</p>
<p>yeah oh yeah wrap your</p>
<p>head around that yeah comedy central pre</p>
<p>south park yeah we were pre comedy central i</p>
<p>think we were back when there was</p>
<p>there was the ha</p>
<p>network and the comedy network</p>
<p>is like the jurassic era</p>
<p>yeah and then they</p>
<p>merged and became</p>
<p>comedy central yeah my</p>
<p>first deal with them was on the comedy channel they did</p>
<p>little profiles of comedians and they</p>
<p>would have you do like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s where i met</p>
<p>sharon levy who&rsquo;s the head of</p>
<p>spike she&rsquo;s one of the heads of programming at spike</p>
<p>she was a pa</p>
<p>and we were in a field</p>
<p>that was on a farm</p>
<p>for handicapped animals</p>
<p>like literally animals that were like like</p>
<p>they had a problem</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to</p>
<p>laugh at handicapping</p>
<p>yeah you can laugh</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna eat them</p>
<p>when they die</p>
<p>but it was like you know like blind</p>
<p>sheep and you know</p>
<p>a cow with a limp and we were and she was holding the</p>
<p>microphone and i was doing like</p>
<p>stand up to</p>
<p>these animals that was like a campaign</p>
<p>program that they put together yeah</p>
<p>the comedy channel it was</p>
<p>yes god it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>funny our time</p>
<p>just fucking</p>
<p>flies by now let&rsquo;s history</p>
<p>remember alan</p>
<p>yeah sure yeah</p>
<p>allenhave used to</p>
<p>he would be at pino</p>
<p>every now and then or whatever that bar was called</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true yeah we</p>
<p>would run yeah he was there</p>
<p>he was doing some show that was nearby</p>
<p>yeah that was the</p>
<p>other thing you&rsquo;d be like</p>
<p>close by and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d also get the feeds from</p>
<p>other other</p>
<p>oh yeah the</p>
<p>other shows</p>
<p>other sets we get to</p>
<p>watch other</p>
<p>horrible sitcoms that was</p>
<p>great geraldo</p>
<p>had a show yeah</p>
<p>that was a good one actually yeah</p>
<p>and so did joey lawrence do you remember that oh i</p>
<p>mostly just remember him sitting in his convertible</p>
<p>playing his own cds really loud</p>
<p>he always had badass cars like</p>
<p>joey lawrence</p>
<p>always had like the newest ferrari or the newest</p>
<p>bentley or whatever</p>
<p>the hell it was but he sit there playing his own</p>
<p>music loud super loud</p>
<p>with a bandana on yeah</p>
<p>okay where is he now man intentionally ripped jeans</p>
<p>he was just in dancing with the stars recently</p>
<p>well i think dave said it best even back then</p>
<p>was that someone needs to tell that</p>
<p>young man that he&rsquo;s gay</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s exactly how you said it too</p>
<p>we stopped and we were looking there</p>
<p>and there was a couple of them</p>
<p>and you just</p>
<p>stopped and paused and said someone needs to tell that</p>
<p>young man he&rsquo;s gay that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>we went into work</p>
<p>i mean he would be right you don&rsquo;t know where</p>
<p>these cars were parked</p>
<p>right directly in front of the building</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;d open up the door and</p>
<p>you basically be on the set and</p>
<p>right behind that is this fucking guy in his car</p>
<p>blaring his own music from</p>
<p>some insane</p>
<p>stereo system that&rsquo;s like and if your</p>
<p>music is great</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s wrong to sit there and listen to your own</p>
<p>music in the car</p>
<p>yeah robert</p>
<p>plant is in his car fucking</p>
<p>beating you know the drums to his</p>
<p>steering wheel yeah they still</p>
<p>be like what the fuck robert really yeah</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get enough attention</p>
<p>yeah yeah but when you joey lawrence yeah</p>
<p>how did you get hooked up with the</p>
<p>south park guys weren&rsquo;t you the baldwin brothers on the</p>
<p>south park movie i was i met</p>
<p>well i met matt and trey um</p>
<p>before there&rsquo;s before south park went on the air</p>
<p>i met him they&rsquo;d done there that the little christmas</p>
<p>thing that was going around yeah</p>
<p>right barnett</p>
<p>yeah brian and santa</p>
<p>and and and jesus which was amazing</p>
<p>and and then</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;d seen that and then they got their deal with with</p>
<p>comedy central</p>
<p>i was at a comedy central</p>
<p>party somewhere in like</p>
<p>one of the good</p>
<p>parties like the rave parties or no it was pretty</p>
<p>quiet it was in a</p>
<p>small bar it was like a tiny</p>
<p>but they were there i remember because i remember</p>
<p>trey was wearing</p>
<p>a shiny silver jumpsuit</p>
<p>sort of a jumpsuit yeah it was like really shiny</p>
<p>you know it was like super dave but in silver</p>
<p>i fucking love those guys i love that they exist</p>

<p>at the time i don&rsquo;t know what the fuck a</p>
<p>south park movie is i don&rsquo;t know what how</p>
<p>how they&rsquo;re gonna do this</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>that they got away with it when they had saddam hussein</p>
<p>and the devil</p>
<p>and that whole</p>
<p>thing yeah penis</p>
<p>just when they first cut</p>
<p>remember when you</p>
<p>first heard like cartman</p>

<p>took it in another direction which</p>
<p>which is fucking</p>
<p>incredible another one of my favorite all time</p>
<p>movies it&rsquo;s hilarious i mean</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just the funniest</p>
<p>that movie for whatever</p>
<p>weird reason</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make me</p>
<p>laugh the second and</p>
<p>third time i don&rsquo;t know why</p>
<p>team america</p>
<p>oh yeah i watched it the</p>
<p>other day it was</p>
<p>fucking maybe i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>watching it</p>
<p>alone maybe i need to</p>
<p>watch it with friends</p>
<p>the first time i</p>
<p>watched it i thought it was the funniest</p>
<p>thing i&rsquo;ve ever seen in my life by a long shot</p>
<p>the scene where the guy</p>
<p>throws up all over himself and the</p>
<p>throw up just won&rsquo;t stop and it goes on forever</p>
<p>i was like these</p>
<p>guys are animals like they don&rsquo;t fuck around</p>
<p>they go so deep</p>
<p>yeah well that was the</p>
<p>scene in the car is going</p>
<p>well first you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to blow me yeah</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kidding no i&rsquo;m serious you&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>gonna have to blow me</p>
<p>did you ever</p>
<p>see the uncut version when they take a shit</p>
<p>the you know</p>
<p>the girl takes a shit on his</p>
<p>chest and pisses</p>
<p>in his face</p>
<p>no no no the</p>
<p>crazy sex scene between</p>
<p>the two dolls oh that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i never saw the</p>
<p>uncut version yeah she shits on his chest</p>
<p>and the sensors were like enough already dude</p>
<p>the fuck wasn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>about censorship it</p>
<p>was yeah it was just that it was just oh come on well i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s also they&rsquo;re very savvy and they</p>
<p>understand the</p>
<p>system that you have to put so many</p>
<p>things in in</p>
<p>order to get what you actually want</p>
<p>so yeah so they feel so the</p>
<p>sensors feel like they&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>their job there was an episode of newsradio</p>
<p>about the word</p>
<p>penis and because this episode</p>
<p>this episode had like you know 30 uses of the word</p>
<p>penis in and they</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t air it one season</p>
<p>and we had to wait</p>
<p>until the subsequent</p>
<p>season before they</p>
<p>started airing it remember that oh</p>
<p>right i forget</p>
<p>and yeah they kept</p>
<p>and then there was</p>
<p>still a negotiation they wanted</p>
<p>the number of</p>
<p>penises removed yeah and</p>
<p>the premise of the</p>
<p>story was bill saying</p>
<p>that you have to say a</p>
<p>bunch of penises in</p>
<p>order to be able to say one or two</p>
<p>you have to compromise</p>
<p>i mean literally they&rsquo;re like letting</p>
<p>everyone in on the goof</p>
<p>and these fuckers</p>
<p>still do it you know</p>
<p>these network people are</p>
<p>still well you&rsquo;re saying it too many times</p>
<p>if you can say penis once</p>
<p>why can&rsquo;t you say it a thousand times what the</p>
<p>fuck is the difference if it&rsquo;s relevant</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s not like what are</p>
<p>you trying to pull off by saying it over and over again</p>
<p>i know well</p>
<p>see i have a problem</p>
<p>cause you know</p>
<p>well you have children and i have children</p>
<p>and my daughter will say well</p>
<p>why is it okay to say poo but not shit</p>
<p>right and my only answer is</p>
<p>cause most of the people in the</p>
<p>world are stupid</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no other explanation for it</p>
<p>there is no</p>
<p>other explanation</p>
<p>because they mean the same thing</p>
<p>you know so i&rsquo;d say like</p>
<p>you know language</p>
<p>you know all words are supposed to just convey</p>
<p>a meaning and if the meanings the</p>
<p>same the words are the same exactly you know we have a</p>
<p>weird really</p>
<p>weird thing</p>
<p>in this country</p>
<p>in this country in this culture</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re sensitive to</p>
<p>secret words you know</p>
<p>secret special words we&rsquo;re very sensitive to yeah</p>
<p>yeah you know whether it&rsquo;s faggot or nigger</p>
<p>or shit or pits it&rsquo;s all shit</p>
<p>there should be no</p>
<p>magical words that have you</p>
<p>know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>completely imprisoned</p>
<p>of superpower</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>yeah and then</p>
<p>the fuck word</p>
<p>you know which is like this sort of like</p>
<p>sort of acceptable like not even that bad anymore in</p>
<p>casual conversation you know</p>
<p>this fucking guy or you know</p>
<p>as long as you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t use it too much people don&rsquo;t really seem to care</p>
<p>businessmen</p>
<p>will say it in meetings yeah</p>
<p>absolutely sure but children</p>
<p>children yeah but we</p>
<p>still send them to</p>
<p>school and tell them</p>
<p>pretend this</p>
<p>still exists</p>
<p>there was a</p>
<p>yeah that these words are bad</p>
<p>there was a</p>
<p>photo that i talked</p>
<p>about on the podcast the</p>
<p>other day i&rsquo;ve been talking</p>
<p>about this on</p>
<p>stage because it&rsquo;s so ridiculous</p>
<p>it was a mexican drug killing</p>
<p>they chopped this guy up into a</p>
<p>bunch of pieces</p>
<p>skinned him took</p>
<p>his skin off of his face like a mask hung it on a stick</p>
<p>all of this is on the air</p>
<p>and then they cut his hands off inside one of his</p>
<p>hands was his dick and his balls and it was blurred out</p>
<p>see that all i can</p>
<p>think is that</p>
<p>and people say mexicans are lazy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot of work</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t see a white killer taking the time it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>he sent a very clear message</p>
<p>and so did the owners of the website that</p>
<p>balls are scary yeah</p>
<p>not skin skulls and no</p>
<p>hands you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s like what is</p>
<p>wrong with us why do we look at things that way like</p>
<p>the other day my daughter she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>taken to saying shit when things don&rsquo;t go well</p>
<p>which is what happens when she hears it you know they</p>
<p>imitate their</p>
<p>atmosphere my wife</p>
<p>is horrified she&rsquo;s like if we stop now she&rsquo;ll stop to</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like and then what</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re just taking a break</p>
<p>just taking a</p>
<p>break for 10 years then she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna start saying shit</p>
<p>again like everybody else</p>
<p>why can&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s cute as hell man i know i&rsquo;ve just told my</p>
<p>daughter just don&rsquo;t do it at</p>
<p>school it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no reason</p>
<p>i keep saying it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s any reason for you not to do it it&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>other than the fact that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get grief from people it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>truly amazing that we grew up knowing they were silly</p>
<p>and now we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>adults and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still silly and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>teaching children and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>this meme takes forever to get out of our</p>
<p>system this forbidden word meme</p>
<p>like why is it still here</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s absolutely</p>
<p>ridiculous we</p>
<p>could eliminate so much and</p>
<p>still convey the</p>
<p>exact same thoughts</p>
<p>if we had no bad words</p>
<p>yeah you could have cunt on</p>
<p>television and everyone</p>
<p>would just get used to it</p>
<p>and it would</p>
<p>be fun it wouldn&rsquo;t change the</p>
<p>world you know it</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t wouldn&rsquo;t make people</p>
<p>angry it wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>cause crime</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re allowed to</p>
<p>bring the word cunt across the border into the united</p>
<p>states i think they will</p>
<p>confiscate the word cunt from your lexicon</p>
<p>if you write in the</p>
<p>work you have to have</p>
<p>three different pages right yeah</p>
<p>sir are you carrying the word cunt in your brain</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;ve just started to do</p>
<p>stand up recently which is</p>
<p>a fascinating</p>
<p>thing to me because i always thought you</p>
<p>would be a brilliant</p>
<p>stand up because you&rsquo;re a great rider</p>
<p>and when we used to do</p>
<p>those little things in the audience remember when</p>
<p>we would talk to the audience before</p>
<p>you would fuck around with them</p>
<p>every now and then and you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t like do</p>
<p>it like phil had a routine that he was doing like phil</p>
<p>actually started doing stand up</p>
<p>because of you know wanting to</p>
<p>entertain the audience so he had a</p>
<p>bunch of bits that he would do</p>
<p>yeah clinton</p>
<p>impressions</p>
<p>were really good and it was like</p>
<p>i was like holy shit dude you know like a real</p>
<p>comic like you&rsquo;re a standup</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>thinking about do it</p>
<p>feels like this really</p>
<p>unusual human being</p>
<p>very very fascinating guy yeah you know</p>
<p>he was the world he was like a</p>
<p>great hobbyist</p>
<p>yeah he would go so deep</p>
<p>he got into flying</p>
<p>and which is actually how i</p>
<p>found out about this neighborhood</p>
<p>yeah phil was taking me out into the valley looking for</p>
<p>different places</p>
<p>where he could</p>
<p>go and have a nice view</p>
<p>we went up in his little single engine</p>
<p>plane but i remember when he first</p>
<p>started getting into the flying</p>
<p>boy he was reading book after book</p>
<p>in between rehearsals he&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>studying his</p>
<p>pilot&rsquo;s book like</p>
<p>the dude was up in the little fake broadcast booth yeah</p>
<p>very he was very very disciplined</p>
<p>i always said phil was like a big league</p>
<p>version of mark mckinney from kids in the hall because</p>
<p>martin mckinney was really into his flight simulator</p>
<p>where phil learned to fly a</p>
<p>plane yeah he</p>
<p>loved it he</p>
<p>learned to fly a</p>
<p>plane he learned to sail a boat</p>
<p>he was one of</p>
<p>those guys you know</p>
<p>if only had</p>
<p>learned to duck</p>
<p>yeah well not even if you had</p>
<p>learned to just separate from fucking</p>
<p>crazy people i know had some</p>
<p>we you know we all did i</p>
<p>think had talks with him many times</p>
<p>about divorce</p>
<p>you know like you got to get out of that man</p>
<p>it was one of</p>
<p>those things</p>
<p>where we would have</p>
<p>these parties i mean paul had one</p>
<p>party once and i remember we were all at this</p>
<p>bar somewhere and</p>
<p>phil showed up with the wife and she just</p>
<p>was saying the</p>
<p>creepiest shit and</p>
<p>insulting him and you</p>
<p>know talking</p>
<p>about how she likes pickup</p>
<p>trucks because they remind her of</p>
<p>you know boys</p>
<p>that she used to bang back when she was younger</p>
<p>and just just</p>
<p>torturing him</p>
<p>just torture</p>
<p>talking about oh well you&rsquo;re not phil you</p>
<p>know phil&rsquo;s too old and he&rsquo;s just didn&rsquo;t he have like</p>
<p>women thrown on him all</p>
<p>the time it seems like if he was that miserable that he</p>
<p>would have just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter man when you have children with somebody</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re inexorably attached forever phil was yeah</p>
<p>the thought of being separated from his kids</p>
<p>and i understand because</p>
<p>at the time i was separated from my kids yeah</p>
<p>yeah i know you know i</p>
<p>completely see</p>
<p>where he was coming from he didn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>a divorce he thought his wife is with all her flaws was</p>
<p>still very good to the kids and</p>
<p>you know and he</p>
<p>felt like he</p>
<p>could work it out</p>
<p>and then he really got in a pot</p>
<p>no that was his</p>
<p>thing he would just get his laser</p>
<p>yeah i was like</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;d be sitting in his mercedes in his parking</p>
<p>space with this one hitter yeah</p>
<p>baked baked</p>
<p>to the gills getting</p>
<p>stoned and you</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t smoking weed at the</p>
<p>time imagine</p>
<p>smoking weed with phil</p>
<p>harvey that</p>
<p>would barely you</p>
<p>yeah yeah you didn&rsquo;t do any any drugs i</p>
<p>would just drunk</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all i would do</p>
<p>yeah i was this is</p>
<p>my old thinking i had a lot of</p>
<p>thinking left</p>
<p>over from my martial arts competition days</p>
<p>and it came to drugs</p>
<p>yeah you know and i thought pot was like one of the</p>
<p>worst for motivation i was like</p>
<p>the last thing i wanted in life was to be a</p>
<p>loser the last</p>
<p>thing i wanted to be was someone who just</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>their shit together was lazy</p>
<p>and i knew so many people that</p>
<p>were like that with marijuana</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;d always</p>
<p>associated it with</p>
<p>losers yeah</p>
<p>you needed your</p>
<p>focus dealt a little i did you</p>
<p>helped me yeah honestly yeah</p>
<p>marijuana is here to calm the</p>
<p>savage instincts of man you know</p>
<p>especially certain</p>
<p>men you know it&rsquo;s very good to me it&rsquo;s yeah</p>
<p>the best self</p>
<p>medication i&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>found yeah i</p>
<p>guess that&rsquo;s why me just turns me into a sponge</p>
<p>makes you extra relaxed</p>
<p>we were talking</p>
<p>about this before the show though you really</p>
<p>should try it when you write</p>
<p>you know i should i haven&rsquo;t like</p>

<p>the ideas just come</p>
<p>yeah the sensor shuts down</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re drunk yeah</p>
<p>yeah oh yeah yeah of course that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>so many great writers are</p>
<p>drunks you know from hemingway the hunter s thompson</p>
<p>so many of them just wanted to escape</p>
<p>or get to it escape from</p>
<p>themselves and get to whatever the ideas were whatever</p>
<p>the words were it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it gives you that window</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t hate yourself long enough</p>
<p>you know before the</p>
<p>depression of the</p>
<p>drinking sets</p>
<p>in but that moment</p>
<p>where you think i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>brilliant and i&rsquo;m beautiful</p>
<p>yeah and before the</p>
<p>depression sets in that was always</p>
<p>the news radio set like you wanted to</p>
<p>leave after</p>
<p>three hours</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t want to be there on the fourth and</p>
<p>fifth hour yeah</p>
<p>when all the irish</p>
<p>blood comes to the floor</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of irish</p>
<p>blood in that</p>
<p>cast so much</p>
<p>she me and mora and you and all of us</p>
<p>mora was mad at me once for a</p>
<p>whole year for</p>

<p>yeah she could hold a grudge</p>
<p>you know and she&rsquo;s so you know you love her you only</p>
<p>want to make up to her so the grudge hurts i know</p>

<p>underneath my apartment</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s oh really yes yes</p>
<p>pete&rsquo;s cafe and i live</p>

<p>crazy fucks go find you</p>
<p>girls with white makeup on and black lipstick</p>
<p>waiting for you yeah</p>
<p>i sorry i started shooting</p>
<p>and she over there short hair</p>
<p>her hair was</p>
<p>going back in it&rsquo;s a single woman now right</p>
<p>yes yeah as she</p>
<p>still i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know i don&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t know i&rsquo;m talking all the time</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re listening</p>
<p>mora pick up a</p>
<p>phone come on yeah holla at your boy make a call</p>
<p>follow me on twitter</p>
<p>call my agent that&rsquo;s the easiest way</p>
<p>i know you&rsquo;re legit</p>
<p>you know how to get ahold of people</p>
<p>so you and you were married at the time</p>
<p>and you were</p>
<p>getting divorced</p>
<p>while we were doing the show</p>
<p>and it was one of the craziest</p>
<p>things i&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>seen in my life and not just the phil hartman divorce</p>
<p>thing you know scared me but dave</p>
<p>things scared me</p>
<p>and one of the reasons why dave&rsquo;s</p>
<p>things scared me was</p>
<p>you do not want to get fucking</p>
<p>married in canada no</p>
<p>because when you</p>
<p>break up in canada</p>
<p>say you decide you want to get a divorce</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t legally get divorced</p>
<p>until you&rsquo;re separate for a year</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s correct</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not sure i can&rsquo;t even remember</p>
<p>i believe it was a year it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tattooed in my brain</p>
<p>because i remember</p>
<p>thinking how</p>
<p>crazy this was that you were fucked</p>
<p>and what was happening was</p>
<p>his first wife was</p>
<p>an eccentric character</p>
<p>and she decided to</p>
<p>start taking the children</p>
<p>all over fucking</p>
<p>world her content</p>
<p>on the radio i</p>
<p>would have gone with that yeah so you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>great guy and i want to say that</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s a cunt yeah</p>
<p>well she&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>mother of your children so</p>
<p>yeah that doesn&rsquo;t excuse it</p>
<p>that is not a get out of get out of cunt freeze</p>
<p>well she was very odd</p>
<p>and the first</p>
<p>season the guys were together and i believe by the</p>
<p>second season it was over</p>
<p>yeah yeah we split up yeah and</p>
<p>so she started</p>
<p>what she would do is</p>
<p>spend all dave&rsquo;s money</p>
<p>so dave would be working and she would</p>
<p>spend all dave&rsquo;s money</p>
<p>i mean by crazy expensive furniture</p>
<p>fly all around the</p>
<p>world all the time</p>
<p>so whenever dave wanted to see his kids</p>
<p>he used to have to get fucking malaria shots yeah okay</p>
<p>so one time we&rsquo;re at one of these nbc</p>
<p>things and dave&rsquo;s fucked up on malaria medication</p>
<p>and gin and tonics or whatever the fuck you were</p>
<p>drinking yeah and you get like</p>
<p>like crazy i had to stop dave from beating a guy up</p>
<p>i had a step in between do you remember</p>
<p>the big guy with the long hair with the fucking don</p>
<p>joe over here tony i</p>
<p>quite like yeah</p>
<p>tony carrie</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t i really like</p>
<p>him it wasn&rsquo;t that the guy had done anything</p>
<p>wrong it was just the malaria</p>
<p>medication you become a psychotic</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very common</p>
<p>effect especially</p>
<p>apparently when you mix it with alcohol yeah</p>
<p>well and you and then you</p>
<p>added that having made two trips to africa</p>
<p>in a month yes</p>
<p>africa to see his fucking</p>
<p>kids like i had to fly to i had to fly to morocco</p>

<p>well at the</p>
<p>time when i like when i made her get into therapy she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like i forced her to get</p>
<p>us to get into couples therapy because i was miserable</p>
<p>and and so since we got</p>
<p>i said let&rsquo;s go to therapy she said well i</p>
<p>gotta go first</p>
<p>and all right you can go see the therapist</p>
<p>at the traps yeah so she goes and</p>
<p>explains to the therapist that i&rsquo;m an abusive husband</p>
<p>uh you know and then she starts phoning</p>
<p>she actually excuse me being physically abusive whoa</p>
<p>and then she starts like phoning my family</p>
<p>and friends</p>
<p>and saying that i&rsquo;m physically abusive</p>
<p>okay complete fabrications right so she&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>creating stories a good friend of mine</p>
<p>steve hibbert when he heard this</p>
<p>said that&rsquo;s crazy if dave was abusive</p>
<p>she would be dead yeah</p>
<p>you know but</p>
<p>no then i go into therapy and the therapist goes</p>
<p>you know who</p>
<p>is prepared for this abusive husband to walk in</p>
<p>and she goes</p>
<p>it was and she explained me</p>
<p>later that was very</p>
<p>weird because you walked in and</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t match the description of you at all</p>
<p>and she said</p>
<p>when you walked in you and i saw you two together</p>
<p>i immediately</p>
<p>realized that if anyone in this couple was abused it</p>
<p>was it was me</p>
<p>did the therapist</p>
<p>say this to her</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if she ever said it to her in therapy</p>
<p>did you have a one on one with the therapist i had</p>
<p>one on one with</p>
<p>it we both saw her individually and together</p>
<p>and then after</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s six months of therapy</p>
<p>my wife when i thought</p>
<p>things were</p>
<p>starting to get better because i was</p>
<p>you know i was able to do</p>
<p>things like go cd</p>
<p>shopping with steve</p>
<p>without get without that being a huge</p>
<p>fight when i got home</p>
<p>you know you know</p>
<p>so that was i got that</p>
<p>oh i&rsquo;m a little</p>
<p>bit of freedom here i can go out and hang out with</p>
<p>hang out with my friends</p>
<p>for a little bit without there being a huge fight and</p>
<p>but then you like she was diagnosed as</p>
<p>having borderline personality disorder</p>
<p>what is that exactly mean why is</p>
<p>it borderline personality disorder well it&rsquo;s a misnomer</p>
<p>really i don&rsquo;t like it</p>
<p>they used to</p>
<p>they used to</p>
<p>think it was because</p>
<p>it was a condition that bordered on being psychotic</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s they</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s they know</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t the condition it&rsquo;s not anything to do with</p>
<p>psychosis but</p>
<p>the name is stuck</p>
<p>the problem with my problem with the</p>
<p>name is when you say borderline personality disorder</p>
<p>do you have a fucking personality disorder or not yeah</p>
<p>what is borderline you&rsquo;re kind of</p>
<p>weird kind of yeah and in fact</p>
<p>cause in fact borderlines</p>
<p>a lot of therapists won&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>treat them cause they</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re just impossible to</p>
<p>treat another horrible people to deal with</p>
<p>you know that they&rsquo;re incredibly</p>
<p>dishonest the pathological</p>
<p>liars how do you</p>
<p>define it though</p>
<p>how can you define</p>
<p>certain sets of mental illness i mean yeah they</p>
<p>do is it a judgment call there&rsquo;s like that</p>
<p>was the dsm is that what it&rsquo;s called the diagnostic</p>
<p>standards manual</p>
<p>something that and it&rsquo;s got like a</p>
<p>checklist and if you</p>
<p>score a certain number on the</p>
<p>checklist they go that&rsquo;s a diagnosis</p>
<p>and i think</p>
<p>she had like nine out of ten</p>
<p>on the checklist</p>
<p>for borderline was she always this</p>
<p>way did she change no she was always that way she was</p>
<p>yeah like basically as soon as we became</p>
<p>a couple like before we were couple she was like my um</p>
<p>before she did she was my best friend&rsquo;s</p>
<p>girlfriend oh shit you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>karma son yeah that&rsquo;s what happened you know</p>
<p>you got hooked up with karma yeah</p>
<p>so it was like one of the</p>
<p>things were</p>
<p>like did she</p>
<p>break up with him</p>
<p>first and then go out with you or you oh</p>
<p>no no it&rsquo;s like one of</p>
<p>these things</p>
<p>where i sort of said look i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>we should stop hanging out so much</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;m you know</p>
<p>right i was like</p>
<p>feeling bad</p>
<p>about it again i was like 20</p>
<p>years old and at that</p>
<p>point kind of lonely and desperate</p>
<p>and said look i&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>these feelings and we</p>
<p>should stop hanging out together</p>
<p>alone really you actually said i have</p>
<p>these feelings and we</p>
<p>should stop hanging out</p>
<p>how many guys</p>
<p>would do that</p>
<p>very few yeah and her reaction that was the</p>
<p>she just showed me her tits and</p>
<p>started kissing me so</p>
<p>oh all right</p>
<p>well i tried you did give it your best</p>
<p>so um so what happens then you go to the</p>
<p>buddy and go hey bro uh i</p>
<p>fucked your girlfriend</p>
<p>again well i</p>
<p>tried to cool it</p>
<p>tried to get out of it and i even was out of town for a</p>
<p>while and tried to stay away from it but</p>
<p>you know he was probably like thank god</p>
<p>thank god yeah well that&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t realize at the time</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;ve gone</p>
<p>alright i thought</p>
<p>things were okay with them and</p>
<p>and you know it wasn&rsquo;t till</p>
<p>she and i hooked up like because</p>
<p>again as soon as we hook</p>
<p>because borderlines when they love you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the most beautiful perfect</p>
<p>thing in the world</p>
<p>but then but then</p>
<p>after that like if anything is</p>
<p>wrong then you</p>
<p>suddenly become the most evil dark horrible</p>
<p>thing in the world</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>the two at the same time they can&rsquo;t see your flaws</p>
<p>and your and your virtues</p>
<p>how do they treat it</p>
<p>wow i think i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>dated somebody</p>
<p>every girl you&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>dated like man i need to</p>
<p>write this fucking</p>
<p>guy you don&rsquo;t even know he just got</p>
<p>out of a relationship with a penthouse pet of the year</p>
<p>oh real and it was</p>
<p>wonderful for me it was like i had my own soap</p>
<p>opera going on</p>
<p>yeah but it was also just like this</p>
<p>where when shit went down it was</p>
<p>it was on or off it was no like</p>
<p>shits down maybe we can work through this it</p>
<p>was just that&rsquo;s one of the key signals of a borderline</p>
<p>is that they say it&rsquo;s an inability</p>
<p>to recognize the good and bad in the same person</p>
<p>wow you know</p>
<p>you can shift from being the most evil person to the</p>
<p>greatest person 100 percent</p>
<p>exactly so with my</p>
<p>first wife before we were a couple</p>
<p>when it was just</p>
<p>illicit you know when it was like these secret feelings</p>
<p>you know when we were friends i was the</p>
<p>greatest guys and she made me feel like i was the</p>
<p>greatest guy on earth</p>
<p>so you thought this is the perfect</p>
<p>woman for me yeah she&rsquo;s with my friend you know</p>
<p>we have to be</p>
<p>they do right you know</p>
<p>yeah you know and then</p>
<p>but as soon as we became a couple</p>
<p>first thing that like sex gone immediately</p>
<p>whoa we didn&rsquo;t have sex for eleven years</p>
<p>wow we were together 11 years and we&rsquo;d have sex</p>
<p>maybe once a year oh my god how did you have two kids</p>
<p>once a year wow</p>
<p>really i have very motile sperm</p>
<p>holy shit we had kids cause she decided she wanted to</p>
<p>get pregnant</p>
<p>and even at that</p>
<p>point i thought</p>
<p>well at least we&rsquo;ll get laid</p>
<p>you know oh god</p>
<p>but dave where were your friends while this was all</p>
<p>going on well what do men friends always do</p>
<p>it depends on the men friends they</p>
<p>never say anything they just sit there and</p>
<p>quietly hate</p>
<p>and hate her not me man</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve learned from the phil hartman</p>
<p>experience i tell people yeah</p>
<p>whenever i think that</p>
<p>my friends in a bad situation i will pull them aside</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve offered</p>
<p>which is on risk you</p>
<p>should take for a friend yeah i&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>friends stay at my</p>
<p>house duncan stayed at my</p>
<p>house for a few</p>
<p>months after he got out yeah</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>gotta tell people like bro</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re stuck and you</p>
<p>think for some reason</p>
<p>that this person is a part of your life</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>this is a show that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>tuning into that you can shut off yeah</p>
<p>and for me it was like this a lot of</p>
<p>guilt about how we</p>
<p>started of course</p>
<p>and then eventually eventually you know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m almost as</p>
<p>crazy as she is</p>
<p>after 11 years of no fucking</p>
<p>your brain doesn&rsquo;t function properly</p>
<p>you know and it&rsquo;s also 11 years of like</p>
<p>twice a month suicide threats oh</p>
<p>god you know oh my god</p>
<p>you know and then you know that you know i got to the</p>
<p>point where i was so</p>
<p>crazy i thought</p>
<p>well man at</p>
<p>least if we have a kid you know</p>
<p>if we have a kid she won&rsquo;t kill herself when i leave</p>
<p>you know and look</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how crazy i</p>
<p>and look oh my</p>
<p>god within a</p>
<p>less than a</p>
<p>month after</p>
<p>my son was born uh</p>
<p>out of nowhere she goes you know i&rsquo;ve been thinking</p>
<p>about it and i think</p>
<p>if you left me even with</p>
<p>a baby i would</p>
<p>still kill myself</p>
<p>like you could read my mind</p>
<p>whoa i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>thinking about it</p>
<p>yeah holy shit it&rsquo;s like really</p>
<p>you make me feel better</p>
<p>about myself dave yeah</p>
<p>it was some really</p>
<p>eye opening moments on that set i</p>
<p>learned so much</p>
<p>about all sorts</p>
<p>of different types of relationships hanging out with</p>
<p>you guys oh yeah well everyone was pretty fucked up in</p>
<p>those days the shower</p>
<p>marriages were in bad</p>
<p>shape yeah yeah</p>
<p>yeah the only one that wasn&rsquo;t well i guess andy</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t really married</p>
<p>right yeah the</p>
<p>kids sort of</p>
<p>married wasn&rsquo;t he</p>
<p>with forgotten her name now</p>
<p>lena lena yes</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sort of</p>
<p>married sort of i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>whatever was they</p>
<p>might have jumped over</p>
<p>a fucking broom like on roots</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if andy actually made it to the</p>
<p>courtroom in time to sign</p>
<p>papers yeah</p>
<p>but yeah well</p>
<p>you know how many relationships are right</p>
<p>yeah of him are together but i remember being</p>
<p>startled when</p>
<p>we all came back from hiatus</p>
<p>and the only one who was divorced was steve root</p>
<p>that right it was</p>
<p>like what we thought you were happy</p>
<p>i know he got fucked hard too here&rsquo;s another one that i</p>
<p>learned from when</p>
<p>steve saved his entire life as a working actor who&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really an actor but had done like a lot of very</p>
<p>small things and</p>
<p>never gotten any notoriety</p>
<p>until newsradio i mean hebrew is really struggling</p>
<p>i believe he said he had</p>
<p>never made more than 50 or 60 000</p>
<p>an entire year ever</p>
<p>before newsradio</p>
<p>then all of a</p>
<p>sudden he does news</p>
<p>radio and he&rsquo;s making really good money</p>
<p>and then his wife gets a divorce and</p>
<p>expects to be paid</p>
<p>for half the length of the relationship the</p>
<p>money he&rsquo;s making now</p>
<p>so she just got instantly used</p>
<p>within a couple</p>
<p>months of this new lifestyle</p>
<p>and he was giving her 10 000</p>
<p>a month and</p>
<p>going fucking crazy</p>
<p>you know i remember just seeing him just</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>pay for you know</p>
<p>lived in a small</p>
<p>apartment was</p>
<p>fucking struggling was trying to put it together</p>
<p>i had a look at that time i was like</p>
<p>when tabs and i</p>
<p>split up she was</p>
<p>going through</p>
<p>about 50 grand a month god</p>
<p>damn it and</p>
<p>that was before we had that was before we had</p>
<p>like a separation agreement</p>
<p>half a million a year yeah</p>
<p>my god running</p>
<p>spending it and you have to make a million to</p>
<p>spend a half a million yeah yeah</p>
<p>jesus christ it</p>
<p>would have been so fun though she was</p>
<p>renovating the</p>
<p>house constantly what</p>
<p>to be her to be her yeah</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s crazy though</p>
<p>she rescape</p>
<p>had the backyard re landscaped</p>
<p>twice because she decided she didn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>where the koi pond was</p>
<p>oh my god you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know queer</p>
<p>pons are pretty awesome though yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the one</p>
<p>thing i&rsquo;ve always thought</p>
<p>about kelly it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>to eat that&rsquo;s nice you know what you can&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>raise a child in a healthy home</p>
<p>without a collective</p>
<p>is that was that her argument you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s her argument</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all for the kids</p>
<p>yeah the kids need a koi</p>
<p>pond kids need to go to morocco and</p>
<p>worry about getting bitten by poisonous insects yeah</p>
<p>she turned like the</p>
<p>third she kept</p>
<p>renovating this</p>
<p>house like least</p>
<p>spent like another like a half a million dollars</p>
<p>renovating a</p>
<p>fully renovated house yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just so</p>
<p>i mean like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>married now</p>
<p>and you know i</p>
<p>think about the</p>
<p>legal ramifications of that and</p>
<p>i do have a prenuptial and all that</p>
<p>stuff and i</p>
<p>absolutely think that</p>
<p>marriage is retarded i</p>
<p>still think it&rsquo;s retarded</p>
<p>but mrs rogan doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>and i love her so i was willing to do it for her</p>
<p>and think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy but god</p>
<p>everywhere around me is just</p>
<p>people with</p>
<p>bullet holes in</p>
<p>their heads</p>
<p>and then i&rsquo;m saying i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i should put this gun in my</p>
<p>mouth it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>trust me it&rsquo;ll be fine</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just like i just see the remnants of divorce</p>
<p>everywhere just constantly</p>
<p>the legal idea of it is just so it seems so</p>
<p>ridiculous that you</p>
<p>would get two people in a relationship and</p>
<p>force them either to be together</p>
<p>or to distribute money</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s fucking it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>crazy yeah i&rsquo;m terrified to get</p>
<p>married just because my own parents getting a divorce</p>
<p>and just stories like this it&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m scared as</p>
<p>fuck my parents</p>
<p>not getting a divorce was equally terrifying yeah</p>
<p>it was like sometimes more yeah</p>
<p>you know but no</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true i mean i&rsquo;ve been i&rsquo;m divorced</p>
<p>twice now you know yeah</p>
<p>you went back</p>
<p>on both ends</p>
<p>right you went back into it</p>
<p>after all that you went back yeah</p>
<p>yeah well you know love is a</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>and again i don&rsquo;t really i don&rsquo;t really believe in</p>
<p>marriage either</p>
<p>but the us is not set up for you not to be married</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re canadian</p>
<p>or no even i</p>
<p>think even for americans there&rsquo;s no like real</p>
<p>civil union</p>
<p>no like you know okay so you</p>
<p>worried about</p>
<p>like if you had to go to the hospital she couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>visit you that&rsquo;s what actually came like</p>
<p>she almost died in an emergency ward once</p>
<p>and i couldn&rsquo;t get any information</p>
<p>about her and i couldn&rsquo;t see her</p>
<p>because you</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t married yeah</p>
<p>oh fuck you know</p>
<p>and as i after that</p>
<p>this country&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>weird because how</p>
<p>would they know if she&rsquo;s in a coma</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not just some creepy fuck that put her in the coma</p>
<p>i mean you could be some weird</p>
<p>stalker i mean</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re actually the husband</p>
<p>prove that you&rsquo;re the current boyfriend you</p>
<p>could be the ex boyfriend and</p>
<p>still trying to get her back yeah</p>
<p>yeah but you can see why in this circumstance</p>
<p>why why if you&rsquo;re gay you really want gay</p>
<p>marriage not</p>
<p>sure not just some</p>
<p>something similar</p>
<p>to marriage</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s to me</p>
<p>one of the most fascinating arguments and immediately</p>
<p>labels you a retard</p>
<p>in my book if you</p>
<p>think that it&rsquo;s a bad idea</p>
<p>gay people shouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>married i think all</p>
<p>marriage is a bad idea</p>
<p>yeah i agree but gay</p>
<p>marriage is no</p>
<p>worse than straight</p>
<p>marriage like why</p>
<p>would you not want and</p>
<p>people will</p>
<p>start talking about</p>
<p>taxes and not</p>
<p>all i hear is</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gay and i&rsquo;m hiding it or i&rsquo;m scared of being gay</p>
<p>or i&rsquo;m humble</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all i hear yeah</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s a couple of</p>
<p>things that somehow gay</p>
<p>marriage is</p>
<p>gonna hurt their</p>
<p>marriage yeah exactly</p>
<p>no that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>to value like like you know like well</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>flood the market with marriages yeah</p>
<p>not that fox show who wants to</p>
<p>marry a millionaire or anything i mean come on</p>
<p>stories like this yeah</p>
<p>housewives of beverly</p>
<p>hills you know if anything devalues</p>
<p>marriage i mean fucking</p>
<p>they had a reality show about flava</p>
<p>flave getting married you know what i mean it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you know nobody nobody protested it this is devalued</p>
<p>married i&rsquo;d show up at that route</p>
<p>but there was two guy</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two guys that i know that live</p>
<p>down the street and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gay and they have kid they have they to</p>
<p>adopt they actually didn&rsquo;t adopt a kid</p>
<p>they have stopped combined their</p>
<p>sperm together and hired someone to carry their baby</p>
<p>and the first woman</p>
<p>changed her mind</p>
<p>right after they had paid for</p>
<p>everything and took care of her for nine</p>
<p>months and gave her a salary</p>
<p>and the baby comes out she goes i</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;m gonna keep it and they&rsquo;re like what</p>
<p>and like they had</p>
<p>spent like hundreds of thousands of dollars they had</p>
<p>given her a</p>
<p>salary for the entire year</p>
<p>and then they had</p>
<p>spent all this</p>
<p>money on medical procedures and taking</p>
<p>care of all of her medical bills and all that stuff</p>
<p>and then at the end she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>psych it&rsquo;s my kid</p>
<p>yeah she just took it and so</p>
<p>they went through the</p>
<p>whole process again</p>
<p>and then had a kid so there wasn&rsquo;t any kind of like</p>
<p>court thing they</p>
<p>could have done</p>
<p>or contracts or</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing you can do it&rsquo;s her baby</p>
<p>it comes out of her body you can&rsquo;t take her baby</p>
<p>you cannot tell yeah but there</p>
<p>should be like hey we&rsquo;re giving you this</p>
<p>money shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be really you don&rsquo;t have to pay it back and the sperm</p>
<p>yeah shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be yeah you know</p>
<p>you know what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i think what she did was</p>
<p>you know i mean probably</p>
<p>deceptive maybe</p>
<p>but who knows</p>
<p>maybe she just</p>
<p>changed her mind</p>
<p>she was overwhelmed by emotions and couldn&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>the idea that she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna leave this kid behind in the world and</p>
<p>and just go</p>
<p>about she wouldn&rsquo;t be able to deal with it i see her</p>
<p>point of view more than i see</p>
<p>their point of view well definitely</p>

<p>i don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>well for the longest</p>
<p>time you did that poker show</p>
<p>yeah and then so</p>
<p>after news radio what did you do after news</p>
<p>radio did you try to develop something else i had like</p>
<p>three or four development deals after that</p>
<p>wrote like about i</p>
<p>wrote like about five</p>
<p>pilots for different</p>
<p>networks and different studios</p>
<p>and none of them sold and</p>
<p>that was it then yeah then just</p>
<p>doing a bunch of</p>
<p>movies brain</p>
<p>candy yeah well</p>
<p>brain candy was</p>
<p>shot while we were doing this radio</p>
<p>is another lesson i</p>
<p>learned that i have to remember before i forget</p>
<p>that i learned</p>
<p>about the movie business dave had a fucking</p>
<p>great movie called the wrong guy</p>
<p>and it was a</p>
<p>great movie and we went to see it i</p>
<p>think brian callan went to see it with me</p>
<p>and we were fucking howling and i was like holy shit</p>
<p>david&rsquo;s gonna be a huge</p>
<p>movie star this is</p>
<p>gonna be a huge movie</p>
<p>and i remember</p>
<p>watching it</p>
<p>going like this is</p>
<p>one of the best comedies</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve seen in years</p>
<p>and then nothing</p>
<p>yeah disney shelved it</p>
<p>yeah well what happened was how hollywood</p>
<p>pictures was our distributor at disney then</p>
<p>they shut hollywood</p>
<p>pictures down in the middle of</p>
<p>production and then</p>
<p>when we were done they reopened hollywood</p>
<p>pictures but with a new president of hollywood pictures</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>touch any of the</p>
<p>stuff that the</p>
<p>other guy had started</p>
<p>they always</p>
<p>there like that</p>
<p>because if it&rsquo;s there if it&rsquo;s a failure it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>their failure yeah but if it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>success it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>other guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>success yeah</p>
<p>so they just don&rsquo;t deal with it</p>
<p>so they so got shelves</p>
<p>for like five years</p>
<p>like they would even</p>
<p>admit they had it and</p>
<p>so it never had a theatrical release</p>
<p>never got theatrical release</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s available on dvd</p>

<p>this business is</p>
<p>crazy like this business</p>

<p>clear because we had you know the big</p>
<p>thing was always well</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>an independent film can you get distribution</p>
<p>and we went into it with distribution we had disney</p>
<p>lined up in the script</p>
<p>phase you know</p>
<p>so we had distribution</p>
<p>lined up we had</p>
<p>we even had</p>
<p>we were even in profit in foreign sales</p>
<p>while we were</p>

<p>taken to can</p>
<p>so we had advanced sales</p>

<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have anything to do with it now</p>
<p>wow there were</p>
<p>other people even</p>
<p>tried to buy it from disney and they</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t sell</p>

<p>success then they fucked up yeah</p>

<p>bunch of fucking</p>
<p>satanists yeah yeah</p>
<p>very very odd that was a weird</p>
<p>phase that duncan our friend duncan went through</p>
<p>cause for a</p>
<p>while he was taking me to like</p>
<p>graveyards to like</p>
<p>hang out with that antoine</p>
<p>guy it was like doing all yeah</p>

<p>houses and they</p>
<p>would have like</p>
<p>and like the dolls with like the</p>
<p>whatever we put needles in them and</p>
<p>stuff and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>i was really kind of getting it for a</p>
<p>while i was like oh i get it now it&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>it almost as a joke almost like you know well duncan</p>
<p>was well duncan</p>
<p>was yeah but</p>
<p>well satanism to</p>
<p>a lot of people</p>
<p>is just a hedonism</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just living life</p>
<p>with pleasure and</p>
<p>enjoying all</p>
<p>the rebellion</p>
<p>against christian</p>
<p>you know morality</p>
<p>yeah i mean it&rsquo;s not really like sacrificing</p>
<p>babies or killing goats or anything</p>
<p>stupid like that yeah</p>
<p>so you have</p>
<p>to put well this is why i brought this up so</p>
<p>i ran into you</p>
<p>on twitter i saw you on twitter and one of the</p>
<p>first things i saw you on twitter</p>
<p>was you talking</p>
<p>about how you had just gotten</p>
<p>the court had just told you you have to pay</p>
<p>three times your</p>
<p>monthly salary</p>
<p>in alimony yeah and i</p>
<p>guess two times left but i</p>
<p>would say is an average</p>
<p>because a lot of</p>
<p>months i don&rsquo;t have a salary</p>
<p>no yeah they ordered</p>
<p>i have to pay</p>
<p>seventeen thousand</p>
<p>seven hundred dollars a month</p>
<p>or go to jail for ten days</p>
<p>every any month that i&rsquo;m late</p>
<p>without warning</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that was the</p>
<p>the judges ruling jail for ten days so do you have to</p>
<p>bet be exported to canada is that what well that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing i&rsquo;m here so</p>
<p>do you know say fuck you i</p>
<p>live here now i just stay here but i yeah i can&rsquo;t risk</p>
<p>going back to canada</p>
<p>you go to jail yeah whoa</p>
<p>so unless i&rsquo;ve come up with</p>
<p>seventeen thousand</p>
<p>seven hundred dollars</p>
<p>which in a month where i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t earned anything is a little hard to do fuck</p>
<p>that so how much are</p>
<p>you sending over there you trying to like whatever i</p>
<p>can yeah like i said five</p>
<p>grand this past</p>
<p>month and they</p>
<p>should go crazy</p>
<p>twenty grand</p>
<p>a few in november</p>
<p>they should go</p>
<p>crazy and yell at you like you need more and</p>
<p>she hasn&rsquo;t talked to me directly</p>
<p>you know really sorry</p>
<p>through lawyers but again</p>
<p>they were trying</p>
<p>through this organization called</p>
<p>the fro the family responsibility office in ontario</p>
<p>that and this this</p>
<p>legal office</p>
<p>is really responsible for hounding</p>
<p>a lot of men to</p>
<p>their death</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a real problem with like people committing suicide um</p>
<p>after being</p>
<p>prosecuted by</p>
<p>these people and</p>
<p>they they were trying to get me</p>
<p>like in november i was sitting in a</p>
<p>court in like november twentieth i guess</p>
<p>sitting in court and</p>
<p>thinking at the end of that day i</p>
<p>might go to jail for six months</p>
<p>they were pushing for me to go to jail for six</p>
<p>months this is what the fro was asking</p>
<p>six month jail sentence if</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t come up with half a million dollars that day</p>
<p>and an additional 30 days for</p>
<p>every month i didn&rsquo;t come up with the money</p>
<p>all right oh my god so and i was sitting there</p>
<p>going well the judge if he goes for it i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>in jail for life they&rsquo;ll cuff me there</p>
<p>that day take me to</p>
<p>jail oh my god and i&rsquo;ll go to jail for six</p>
<p>months the end of six months they&rsquo;ll say you know</p>
<p>well do you have the half million dollars</p>
<p>and plus the ongoing</p>
<p>money that would a crew over the six months</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;d say no i&rsquo;ve been in jail for six</p>
<p>months how was i supposed to earn any money all</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s another 30 days the end of that 30 days</p>
<p>yeah the money no i&rsquo;ve been in jail so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>essentially a life sentence unless someone gives you</p>
<p>500 000 yeah</p>
<p>how long how much longer do you have for this</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s really unending</p>
<p>until i pay off the rears</p>
<p>that i owe right</p>
<p>you know and that&rsquo;s crazy and then till the kids are</p>
<p>twenty two if they stay in school</p>
<p>so and again and so then the</p>
<p>money just keeps adding up and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m chopping my dick off tonight yeah like i mean</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you know just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>marry a canadian chick yeah i mean in order to pay 17</p>
<p>700 i have to earn</p>
<p>about 40 000 in a month just to pay that just you know</p>
<p>you know with</p>
<p>you know twenty percent commission</p>
<p>thirty five percent tax bracket</p>
<p>you know so i got to earn forty thousand</p>
<p>just to have zero dollars fuck</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s someone you hate</p>
<p>yeah yeah and you didn&rsquo;t fuck me for eleven years</p>
<p>tell what crazy ass laws</p>
<p>now when you tell them that you don&rsquo;t make that much</p>
<p>money anymore what do they</p>
<p>say the judge who pat who made this ruling</p>
<p>because they were</p>
<p>asking for the six</p>
<p>months right</p>
<p>and the judge kept saying to the fro attorney</p>
<p>you know give me another option</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;m looking at i&rsquo;m looking at the</p>
<p>the the financial documents</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m seeing</p>
<p>where all the money</p>
<p>all the money that has come in i&rsquo;m seeing</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s all gone</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all here in this documents</p>
<p>all the money that&rsquo;s come in and</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s all gone i can see it all in these documents</p>
<p>so i am convinced that there isn&rsquo;t a half</p>
<p>a million dollars for mr foley to come up with today</p>
<p>so if you insist on that ruling</p>
<p>then i would</p>
<p>send him to jail and your client will</p>
<p>never see another</p>
<p>dime because mr foley&rsquo;s career will be over</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>and he kept saying</p>
<p>give me an option that will get your client some money</p>
<p>and the fro</p>
<p>refused to say well</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have the authority from our client my ex wife</p>
<p>to make any</p>
<p>other offer um</p>
<p>so for about two hours the</p>
<p>judge kept asking them to come up with another</p>
<p>so all this time when you&rsquo;re sitting there you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going i&rsquo;m going to jail yeah and i</p>
<p>might be going to jail</p>
<p>essentially forever yeah yeah</p>
<p>what happened</p>
<p>going to jail for being for the</p>
<p>crime of not earning a million</p>
<p>dollars oh my god so what happens if that actually does</p>
<p>happen i mean we have guys gone in jail with an alarm</p>
<p>some like that and</p>
<p>never come out</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know but people have</p>
<p>definitely gone to jail and</p>
<p>and definitely there&rsquo;s a lot of people who have</p>
<p>been looking at jail time have just killed themselves</p>
<p>now can you</p>
<p>get the kids and have them stay with</p>
<p>you so that she has to tell you it&rsquo;s alimony bro it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>alimony no this is</p>
<p>child support it&rsquo;s all</p>

<p>what&rsquo;s the solution so you cannot go to canada</p>
<p>and you just send whatever</p>
<p>you have and then you have to constantly deal with</p>
<p>legal payments</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re constantly trying to fuck you and i</p>
<p>spent like a year and a half</p>
<p>literally going to</p>
<p>court every single month</p>
<p>with lawyers just</p>
<p>basically go having to go to court</p>
<p>every month just</p>
<p>just stay out of jail</p>
<p>to go and have them put it over till the next month</p>
<p>and the lawyers</p>
<p>you know the lawyers</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>you know people that do family law</p>
<p>a lot of them are really horrible people</p>
<p>and they just make</p>
<p>money off misery</p>
<p>and even my own lawyers</p>
<p>were just you know extending this as far as they could</p>
<p>until i ran out of money</p>
<p>and like and then quit so when i went to court</p>
<p>for this ruling</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t have a lawyer and</p>
<p>because i couldn&rsquo;t afford one so you</p>
<p>went by yourself i was there by myself not only was i</p>
<p>there by myself but all of the documents that had been</p>
<p>piled up all of the evidence that had been piled up</p>
<p>over the course of a year</p>
<p>and a half was sitting in my lawyer&rsquo;s office oh my god</p>
<p>you know so you had no evidence and no lawyer yeah</p>
<p>did you have</p>
<p>records did you have anything i had nothing i</p>
<p>had nothing god so you&rsquo;re just going</p>
<p>i have nothing i have no</p>
<p>money i this is all i can do yeah and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>asked me questions</p>
<p>about files</p>
<p>that have been</p>
<p>piling up over a year and a half</p>
<p>you know but how do they just</p>
<p>think i don&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t recall i don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>know cause i don&rsquo;t you know</p>
<p>how do they justify such an exorbitant amount of money</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the the</p>
<p>as it was explained to me by my lawyers was that the</p>
<p>court&rsquo;s assumption is that the children</p>
<p>should continue to live</p>
<p>at the level they were at</p>
<p>at the time of the dissolution of the marriage</p>
<p>so which is</p>
<p>crazy because if</p>
<p>we were still</p>
<p>married and my income dropped</p>
<p>their lifestyle</p>
<p>would change</p>
<p>right but because we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>married anymore</p>
<p>their lifestyle</p>
<p>should never change no matter what i&rsquo;m earning</p>
<p>well i said the</p>
<p>judge the ruling that was enforced was by another</p>
<p>judge named</p>
<p>justice backhouse</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s the one who ruled</p>
<p>about three four years ago</p>
<p>when i went back to try and get it adjusted i went to</p>
<p>have a hearing to have it adjusted to</p>
<p>meet my income</p>
<p>um and she ruled</p>
<p>against me and in her ruling she said my ability to pay</p>
<p>was not relevant to my obligation</p>
<p>so it didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>matter to her what i proved my income to be</p>
<p>if my income was zero</p>
<p>she said i was still</p>
<p>obligated to pay</p>
<p>as though i was earning a million dollars</p>
<p>i know a lot of people saying joe rogan this day</p>
<p>fully guys bumming me the fuck out i</p>
<p>feel like yeah</p>
<p>well listen</p>
<p>this some important shit this was my education in</p>
<p>in relationships and the law</p>
<p>regarding relationships as i was growing up literally</p>
<p>i mean when i was on newsrady i was a</p>
<p>fresh faced boy didn&rsquo;t know jack shit</p>
<p>about the world</p>
<p>and this is how i learned</p>
<p>about relationships this is how i</p>
<p>learned about</p>
<p>the whole gamut</p>
<p>from divorce</p>
<p>to fucking murder suicide</p>
<p>and i learned that all</p>
<p>you are happily</p>
<p>married yeah</p>
<p>crazy what are the odds figured it out</p>
<p>who no no yeah</p>
<p>got lucky yeah</p>
<p>could go ugly for me too</p>
<p>i would do in your podcast</p>
<p>i would probably</p>
<p>seriously just move somewhere like live on a</p>
<p>beach in jeb</p>
<p>loves his kids you</p>
<p>get to see your kids</p>
<p>not now i can&rsquo;t go to canada so i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t see him at all</p>
<p>no when was the last time you saw them i was in</p>
<p>november wow</p>
<p>that would drive me</p>
<p>nuts last time i saw i</p>
<p>went to see my son&rsquo;s play at</p>
<p>school as last time i saw</p>
<p>and was the chick there the wife no no she was</p>
<p>there thank god</p>
<p>so you have no communication with her at all</p>
<p>no not no not in you don&rsquo;t have to pay any more alimony</p>
<p>no she didn&rsquo;t seek</p>
<p>alimony she saw it</p>
<p>child support</p>
<p>because yeah but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>none of it got to the kids</p>
<p>you know it all goes to her</p>
<p>yeah she was getting you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all this</p>
<p>money and then on top of the</p>
<p>child support payment which is</p>
<p>she was also getting something called section</p>
<p>seven expenses which is</p>
<p>basically anything she</p>
<p>chose to any bills she</p>
<p>chose to run up</p>
<p>what you know so be like</p>
<p>twenty thousand dollars for summer camp</p>
<p>things like</p>
<p>that anything that was for the kids that she chose</p>
<p>yeah so not just</p>
<p>alimony not or not just</p>
<p>child support but</p>
<p>child support</p>
<p>plus and then</p>
<p>all of her living expenses you know like the</p>
<p>the mortgage and</p>
<p>you know everything medical expenses everything</p>
<p>this makes me sick</p>
<p>it should make you sick</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so strange and i don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a way around it i don&rsquo;t know how to fix it but</p>
<p>it certainly</p>
<p>should not apply to something as</p>
<p>crazy and transient as a hollywood job</p>
<p>the greatest job ever a sitcom job cause</p>
<p>those only last</p>
<p>a few years and you usually get one of them your</p>
<p>whole life yeah you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just rare as fuck how could you</p>
<p>i mean in the</p>
<p>stephen root situation was the same situation i mean</p>
<p>he got fucked</p>
<p>based on you know</p>
<p>the fact that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you know he was making the most</p>
<p>money and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when she decided to get and was good yeah</p>
<p>find the whole assumption that</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>based on an assumption that&rsquo;s 50 years old that women</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t take care of themselves they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>you know they can&rsquo;t all right</p>
<p>just pray for</p>
<p>just pray for breast cancer believe</p>
<p>it or not i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>covering this in my</p>
<p>stand up but</p>
<p>humorously wow</p>
<p>there are jokes to be</p>
<p>made good luck with that</p>
<p>yeah i mean</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s much more difficult for</p>
<p>women to take care of themselves</p>
<p>especially women who have children</p>
<p>fucking hard to shit man</p>
<p>how raising</p>
<p>kids you know</p>
<p>people who don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that it&rsquo;s a job to</p>
<p>raise kids you</p>
<p>never tried to</p>
<p>raise kids you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about i am amazed that kids</p>
<p>are a lot of work did</p>
<p>so many people</p>
<p>think that it&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>or that it&rsquo;s no big deal to</p>
<p>have a full time job and have children</p>
<p>like i have a friend of mine who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>thirty six who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still wanting to have kids and she&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>thinking that it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna interrupt her job</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like you work eight ten</p>
<p>hours a day you&rsquo;re fucking</p>
<p>crazy you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have a new</p>
<p>human being</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s talking all this craziness about</p>
<p>childcare i&rsquo;m like listen</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an immense</p>
<p>immense amount of work beyond your comprehension yeah</p>
<p>and especially if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>traveling through italy</p>
<p>or africa right</p>
<p>with just the one nanny</p>
<p>just one nanny</p>
<p>yeah wow how</p>
<p>could you do that i don&rsquo;t know she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>roughing it yep wow</p>
<p>so i don&rsquo;t mean to bum anybody out and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry the order went</p>
<p>so in depth</p>
<p>so in depth</p>
<p>about this we can cut it down yeah no we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to this</p>
<p>is live and we don&rsquo;t edit it</p>
<p>no everyone just go by kids in the hall on dvd support</p>
<p>daily does that</p>
<p>money go to you shows</p>
<p>does that money go to you</p>
<p>ah small percentage what</p>
<p>about the wrong guy does that go to you yeah</p>
<p>really well yeah</p>
<p>almost nothing almost no i</p>
<p>think i just gave you almost nothing there</p>
<p>you go yeah</p>
<p>well almost i mean</p>
<p>that rarely ever sells a copy</p>
<p>so tell me this how did you go from doing</p>
<p>newsradium you had a</p>
<p>bunch of pilots that didn&rsquo;t take off</p>
<p>how the fuck does that not</p>
<p>how do you not</p>
<p>wind up on something else how does that not happen</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i mean i did a</p>
<p>you know i was in a</p>
<p>bunch of pilots</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pilots that i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>write none of</p>
<p>those shows went</p>
<p>and then you know then i also like</p>
<p>was it was the judge on</p>
<p>thank god you&rsquo;re here with on nbc</p>
<p>which would have been a good money gig</p>
<p>what is that it was an improv show</p>
<p>based on australian improv show</p>
<p>oh did like</p>
<p>seven episodes on on nbc but then it got canceled</p>
<p>this is like during the writer strike</p>
<p>um so you know</p>
<p>you know and you know</p>
<p>and then they just becomes you know</p>
<p>the industry is all</p>
<p>about perception then the perception is just oh</p>
<p>well he&rsquo;s cold oh</p>
<p>you know how weird is that huh you know</p>
<p>and i kind of kind of thought there would be a problem</p>
<p>i mean i remember</p>
<p>talking to vicki</p>
<p>and saying like when news i kept saying when</p>
<p>well when newsradio gets cancelled</p>
<p>i said i&rsquo;ll probably</p>
<p>be the hardest for me to get work of anyone else</p>
<p>why&rsquo;d you think that because i was</p>
<p>first in the credits and the show was</p>
<p>never a hit</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s how they do that yeah so everyone else was</p>
<p>a supporting</p>
<p>player on a critically acclaimed show</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>but i was the</p>
<p>you know supposedly the lead character</p>
<p>on a show that</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t a hit so it&rsquo;d be well he couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>carry a show</p>
<p>wow what a weird way to look at it yeah</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know a lot of people that don&rsquo;t even realize news</p>
<p>radio wasn&rsquo;t a hit but</p>
<p>while we were on the air</p>
<p>we were on the air we</p>
<p>moved nine times</p>
<p>nine times over the course of five</p>
<p>seasons and oh yeah</p>
<p>the guy had the head of programming it it it</p>
<p>of scheduling and nbc hated us</p>
<p>why was that</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know remember there was that</p>
<p>whole thing with</p>
<p>the rolling</p>
<p>stone article yes</p>
<p>but that was</p>
<p>when we were already floundering yeah</p>
<p>but it was also but the guy</p>
<p>this guy but we</p>
<p>should tell people what that means yeah what&rsquo;s rolling</p>
<p>the rolling star down a girl</p>
<p>paul stanley or paul stanley</p>
<p>yeah kiss paul simms</p>
<p>who was the</p>
<p>creator of the show called</p>
<p>nbc&rsquo;s thursday</p>
<p>night lineup</p>
<p>which was their big friends lineup</p>
<p>they called it a shit sandwich</p>
<p>called it was really it</p>
<p>should have been</p>
<p>shit was the bun</p>
<p>because the real sandwich was friends</p>
<p>and then you</p>
<p>would have friends on and then you</p>
<p>would have this terrible show</p>
<p>you know that was always on</p>
<p>after friends yeah</p>
<p>and you know obviously nbc was very</p>
<p>upset that paul</p>
<p>was calling sex in the city or the single guy two</p>
<p>pieces of shit</p>
<p>but you know they were they were terrible</p>
<p>shows and then friends</p>
<p>was this brilliant show that everybody tuned into</p>
<p>so they sort of</p>
<p>watched those</p>
<p>other shows just because they were on</p>
<p>but i guess</p>
<p>the guy in terms of the guy</p>
<p>guessing preston</p>
<p>beckman hated our show even when we did the</p>
<p>pilot he didn&rsquo;t want it picked up</p>
<p>because we were originally supposed to get a</p>
<p>thursday slot ourselves</p>
<p>but this guy who was in charge of the nbc</p>
<p>schedule wouldn&rsquo;t let us have a</p>
<p>thursday slot</p>
<p>so then he basically kept trying to find a slot that</p>
<p>would kill us</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why they put us on</p>
<p>what we were the leading</p>
<p>we were on with wings and fraser</p>
<p>and those shows were both doing poorly when we came</p>
<p>along he put us on with</p>
<p>those shows and we our show we</p>
<p>boosted the ratings of both shows</p>
<p>well all sudden became like a decent lineup</p>
<p>for for commies but it</p>
<p>it was a different time then man there was no dvrs and</p>
<p>shows couldn&rsquo;t exist in</p>
<p>a non popular spot it had to be a spot</p>
<p>where people were</p>
<p>already looking well the ratings we were getting in</p>
<p>those we were getting like 10 million people</p>
<p>tuning in yeah</p>
<p>and those ratings in</p>
<p>those days were considered</p>
<p>a ratings failure</p>
<p>like today if you got</p>
<p>those ratings you&rsquo;re the number one show on tv</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s weird isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>cause there&rsquo;s so many channels now at one</p>
<p>point in time</p>
<p>lou morton used</p>
<p>to show up at our writer&rsquo;s meetings at the</p>
<p>rather at the runtime oh</p>
<p>yeah the table reads with a</p>
<p>t shirt on with the number of whatever we were in</p>
<p>would place we&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>and he showed up and it was 84</p>
<p>yes we were in 84th place</p>
<p>and we were like what the was it 84 or</p>
<p>88 it was that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when they finally when</p>
<p>they put us up</p>
<p>against drew carey</p>
<p>yeah and then we had</p>
<p>warren littlefield actually came down to a</p>
<p>table read to let</p>
<p>us know that they</p>
<p>still loved us</p>
<p>where they serve</p>
<p>as turkey dinner</p>
<p>oh yeah remember lauren lauren</p>
<p>like it was there carving turkey and</p>
<p>warren littlefield whatever yeah</p>
<p>yeah he was a nice guy he was a nice guy</p>
<p>or a network head yeah he was very nice to us</p>
<p>i always remember 95</p>
<p>warren littlefield dancing on the bar in new york</p>
<p>when we went for the upfronts</p>
<p>and it was like jay leno</p>
<p>had just hit</p>
<p>was the number one late night show</p>
<p>wow and when warren was</p>
<p>standing on this bar doing shots and shouting 1995</p>
<p>oh wow that&rsquo;s hilarious</p>
<p>was that the one</p>
<p>which one did you guys get</p>
<p>drunk at i didn&rsquo;t go and you guys get</p>
<p>drunk at every event</p>
<p>but we got kicked out where we</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t allowed to go was it the sag awards yeah</p>
<p>these motherfuckers got so hammered</p>
<p>they caused so much damage at the sag awards</p>
<p>we couldn&rsquo;t go anymore</p>
<p>we weren&rsquo;t allowed to go i&rsquo;ve still never been back</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a great one</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re at the emmys and this is</p>
<p>after phil had been murdered</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re sitting</p>
<p>there and you know phil was nominated for something and</p>
<p>the nominations go and i</p>
<p>think the guy from frasier</p>
<p>got it david</p>
<p>hay pierce yeah</p>
<p>and dave turns to me and goes</p>
<p>what does phil have to do to win</p>
<p>like oh no you know it was so i know</p>
<p>it was in david</p>
<p>david i pierce</p>
<p>looks so embarrassed to be winning yeah he was</p>
<p>literally up there like his</p>
<p>all the blood</p>
<p>drained out of his face and he was just going um</p>
<p>well obviously</p>
<p>phil hartman</p>
<p>you know he</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t even like put a sentence together he was</p>
<p>yeah i wonder what the choice behind that was that was</p>
<p>weird you know</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t kill someone and then you know</p>
<p>expect them to win</p>
<p>so the message yeah</p>
<p>setting out to</p>
<p>murder is cheating</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s cheating</p>
<p>being murdered is a</p>
<p>cheat oh what a</p>
<p>strange strange times so what did you guys do at the</p>
<p>sag awards that got us kicked out forever i</p>
<p>know i think</p>
<p>most you&rsquo;re just uh</p>
<p>at the time i guess</p>
<p>cause we all thought what a</p>
<p>stupid award show</p>
<p>you know this is the</p>
<p>first year of the sag awards</p>
<p>we said this is</p>
<p>ridiculous why actors</p>
<p>voting about each</p>
<p>other and giving awards</p>
<p>gross saying who&rsquo;s best</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the you know our</p>
<p>union is deciding who is best</p>
<p>and it creates this weird</p>
<p>culture of ass kissing and fakery</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>all like what a wonderful project you know and amazing</p>
<p>and i think what we do i</p>
<p>think moore and i found</p>
<p>where the service bar was</p>
<p>and they had like the big industrial corkscrew and</p>
<p>everything so we were</p>
<p>going back there just opening up bottles of wine</p>
<p>and bringing them up to the table and i think you know</p>
<p>and then you know we had andy with this too yeah</p>
<p>which was so who did what</p>
<p>did anybody do anything notable that got us kicked out</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t really remember i</p>
<p>think we were just noisy and rude</p>
<p>and stealing we were applauding inappropriately</p>
<p>like there was no malaria</p>
<p>medicine back then was there no this</p>
<p>was just a drink</p>
<p>the malaria medicine when he took a reporter</p>
<p>a reporter came up to him with a tape recorder</p>
<p>and asked him some questions dave took his microphone</p>
<p>stuck it in his drink</p>
<p>and then pushed him no way</p>
<p>yes and that&rsquo;s when we realized like dave was off the</p>
<p>tracks in the woods</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t dave anymore</p>
<p>and then dave was fucking</p>
<p>screaming at this tony guy</p>
<p>fucking up my show and my fucking people i fucking were</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like oh my god i think dave&rsquo;s gonna hit him</p>
<p>and i had to get in between him i had</p>
<p>to corner him</p>
<p>in a bar like physically i had a physically cornered</p>
<p>dave to keep him from attacking this</p>
<p>other guy yeah</p>
<p>but we were always the ones to last to leave the bar</p>
<p>the news radio crew was always last to leave the bar</p>
<p>yeah i think we had this idea</p>
<p>felt like we were like the punks</p>
<p>of primetime comedy</p>
<p>well we were the</p>
<p>least bullshitty</p>
<p>of that you know there&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>whole culture this actor culture</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>of the reasons why i was willing to do newsradio</p>
<p>afterwards like the</p>
<p>thought of working with actual actors for five years</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like somehow or another i had managed to see the</p>
<p>worst case scenario with this hardball</p>
<p>and then slip</p>
<p>into the best case scenario for five years in newsradio</p>
<p>and then it</p>
<p>was like auditions and being around real actors</p>
<p>again i&rsquo;m like fuck this man what is there</p>
<p>other shit i can do</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s ready</p>
<p>it was a cast</p>
<p>where you regularly hear people say</p>
<p>you know what my joke</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work we</p>
<p>should cut my joke that his joke</p>
<p>is the better joke yes</p>
<p>all the time</p>
<p>you know it was really an amazing environment and you</p>
<p>would also hear don&rsquo;t put that pencil in my cunt</p>
<p>you would hear things like that i mean people</p>
<p>would just say the most fucked up shit ever i mean</p>
<p>do you remember the time we had the</p>
<p>we actually had to sit down and</p>
<p>they played that presentation for us oh</p>
<p>the sexual harassment</p>
<p>oh i felt so badly for that person what was that</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know the</p>
<p>group of people you&rsquo;ve just walked in front of</p>
<p>it was so ridiculous</p>
<p>they have to go over this whole</p>
<p>thing of what&rsquo;s appropriate and what&rsquo;s not appropriate</p>
<p>yeah it would have</p>
<p>meant basically</p>
<p>would have cut down</p>
<p>about 98 of all conversation on our set</p>
<p>i mean we all just sort of</p>
<p>you know just made an</p>
<p>agreement that we wouldn&rsquo;t sue each other yeah</p>
<p>yeah like okay</p>
<p>this doesn&rsquo;t this</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t apply right but if anybody</p>
<p>wanted to i mean there&rsquo;s been many times on sets where</p>
<p>you know especially</p>
<p>women actresses</p>
<p>feel like there&rsquo;s too much of that shit going on</p>
<p>and they just fucking fuck this i&rsquo;m getting a lawyer</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s payouts man it becomes like a big</p>
<p>issue yeah you make a lot of</p>
<p>money i know</p>
<p>cause i remember</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;d have andy</p>
<p>andy would be sitting there to vicky going</p>
<p>they got us want to</p>
<p>stuff your pussy for</p>
<p>leaves and twigs and mud</p>
<p>you know vicky</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>vicky would be laughing</p>
<p>i remember the very</p>
<p>first time i met andy i mean</p>
<p>again i&rsquo;d been acting for a fucking</p>
<p>month right i</p>
<p>knew no one like that i grew up with</p>
<p>fighters and pool hustlers</p>
<p>those are the two</p>
<p>worlds that i was most</p>
<p>entrenched in and</p>
<p>crazy stand up comedians they&rsquo;re all nuts right</p>
<p>and then all of a</p>
<p>sudden i&rsquo;m in this</p>
<p>dressing room with andy</p>
<p>and andy is sitting</p>
<p>cross legged</p>
<p>and he has clogs on</p>
<p>okay and he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>these weird</p>
<p>brown corduroy</p>
<p>pants and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>flipping his foot back and forth he goes</p>
<p>do you think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be famous</p>
<p>and i was like i don&rsquo;t know what do you</p>
<p>think oh yes</p>
<p>i know i&rsquo;m gonna be</p>
<p>i know i&rsquo;m gonna be</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve already decided</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna be so</p>
<p>famous i can&rsquo;t wait</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t wait to be really really</p>
<p>famous do you</p>
<p>think this is</p>
<p>gonna be the show for you or</p>
<p>maybe not yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like i don&rsquo;t know man i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>you gonna be</p>
<p>famous oh i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna be so</p>
<p>famous from this show yeah</p>
<p>i think you</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s already happening yeah i</p>
<p>think the arc of your friendship</p>
<p>with andy was the most interesting of the whole cast</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d only wish i had marijuana back then</p>
<p>yeah yeah i</p>
<p>would have found him so much more</p>
<p>fascinating because i had testosterone and adrenaline</p>
<p>and that was just</p>
<p>every day was just don&rsquo;t kill andy</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t kill him</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t fucking</p>
<p>kill him because he was just so out of control i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never met someone so out of control but on set nobody</p>
<p>enjoyed andy more than you did</p>
<p>love them like doing scenes</p>
<p>like joe had so much</p>
<p>trouble getting through</p>
<p>scenes with andy</p>
<p>because they</p>
<p>would laugh you</p>
<p>bust you up constantly</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s hilarious</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s one of the funniest</p>
<p>human beings i&rsquo;ve ever met in my life</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s only been there&rsquo;s been a few</p>
<p>human beings that i&rsquo;ve ever met in my life</p>
<p>where i was like wow</p>
<p>what a fucking original</p>
<p>joey diaz is one of them and andy dick is one of them</p>
<p>joey&rsquo;s funnier than andy but he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>stand up but andy</p>
<p>fucking christ he was</p>
<p>funny and he&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>doubt he&rsquo;s talented</p>
<p>so weird but</p>
<p>he needs to be handled</p>
<p>andy&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those guys that needs a paul sims and crew behind him</p>
<p>or you write for</p>
<p>him and you put him in yeah and he&rsquo;s goddamn gold and</p>
<p>after that was over i was like how is no one</p>
<p>grabbing him</p>
<p>and doing another one of these yeah</p>
<p>instead he went and done did that</p>
<p>mtv show which was so</p>
<p>and he was on</p>
<p>for a few years on</p>
<p>was it less than perfect</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t he&rsquo;s on that for</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t even been as long as news radio that</p>
<p>now he&rsquo;s like living in a garage somewhere</p>
<p>in a shack on his own property</p>
<p>with his ex</p>
<p>wives god i</p>
<p>heard a story</p>
<p>about him the other day</p>
<p>where he went to</p>
<p>like my friend lives in this</p>
<p>apartment building</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s just like you know like the</p>
<p>courtyards in the middle</p>
<p>and they heard all</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>yelling at like 1 am they look outside and i guess</p>
<p>andy was just like</p>
<p>screaming like i need a beer</p>
<p>and some guy upstairs is like hey</p>
<p>are you a hindi</p>
<p>dick and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like yeah and he&rsquo;s like we got beer up here man</p>
<p>and so he just came up there and</p>
<p>party till like 4 am</p>
<p>with these strangers in his apartment</p>
<p>sounds like</p>
<p>an ending well i got a text recently i was like</p>
<p>asleep thank god</p>
<p>but then i woke</p>
<p>up and i just got this text from a friend that said</p>
<p>that andy was in the bar downstairs from where my</p>
<p>apartment is</p>
<p>and he said</p>
<p>andy dick is</p>
<p>here and he&rsquo;s making a complete ass of himself</p>
<p>and yeah he was like running through the restaurant</p>
<p>he was like</p>
<p>grabbing the waitresses</p>
<p>tits and he was like</p>
<p>like stealing food off people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>plates and at one</p>
<p>point he apparently</p>
<p>crawled under all the</p>
<p>tables and was knocking</p>
<p>tables over</p>
<p>and then he went into the</p>
<p>kitchen and</p>
<p>tried to make out with</p>
<p>you know the dishwasher</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>how is he gonna</p>
<p>get arrested</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s been arrested a lot yeah</p>
<p>well but i do a joke</p>
<p>about it in my act</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>ridiculous people</p>
<p>go can you believe andy did get arrested</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like i can&rsquo;t believe he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t get arrested</p>
<p>every day a day that goes by</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s not arrested</p>
<p>you could have a tv show</p>
<p>called let&rsquo;s get any dick arrested and that&rsquo;s what it</p>
<p>would be just</p>
<p>every day you show up yeah</p>
<p>cause he is</p>
<p>committing a felony</p>
<p>every day probably yeah</p>
<p>you know poor fucking guy</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>he needs to be handled but even if he&rsquo;s handled he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna go out of control no i mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>again i think newsradio is such a good</p>
<p>place for him because none of us</p>
<p>really would take any shit from him that yes and also</p>
<p>because he never</p>
<p>became famous from that show</p>
<p>yeah you know it was always floundering and it</p>
<p>never really it became a hit</p>
<p>after it was in syndication that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>it became a hit</p>
<p>but there were some moments there were some moments</p>
<p>where andy tried to get</p>
<p>crazy you know and yeah</p>
<p>especially you know he would</p>
<p>try not to pay attention or try to you know</p>
<p>force extra attention on himself</p>
<p>rehearsals delaying</p>
<p>things or fucking up rehearsals or</p>
<p>forgetting to show up yeah</p>
<p>yeah leaving his son on the set when he left</p>
<p>drove home and forgot his fucking kid</p>
<p>he sent this comedy now</p>
<p>right yeah lucas</p>
<p>i saw i think i saw him the</p>
<p>other day at open mic oh</p>
<p>yeah give the poor kid a hug</p>
<p>yeah i saw some</p>
<p>i actually did improv</p>
<p>with andy it</p>
<p>improve olympic</p>
<p>wow io they call it out back with</p>
<p>respect when he had the</p>
<p>ankle bracelet on so he was sober</p>
<p>and i was like i you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s gone wow</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weird andy i don&rsquo;t you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird to be around you when you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>when he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>fucked up yeah last time i saw him he was sober</p>
<p>he came up to the comedy or to the improv rather</p>
<p>yeah took a</p>
<p>picture of him</p>
<p>cause really i&rsquo;ve always said</p>
<p>about any of those</p>
<p>i never really</p>
<p>understood why</p>
<p>he needs so much like drugs and booze cause</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what inhibitions he&rsquo;s trying to release</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s not what it is he&rsquo;s trying to</p>
<p>quell the demons of his past memories</p>
<p>andy and i had a long conversation</p>
<p>about it once</p>
<p>where he told me he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t remember anything from age like</p>
<p>eight or nine on</p>
<p>anything earlier than that yeah</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t remember it he</p>
<p>literally doesn&rsquo;t remember his</p>
<p>childhood why</p>
<p>his no recollection</p>
<p>cause it was a horribly traumatic</p>
<p>all right he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know his parents i mean</p>
<p>i think he met them</p>
<p>after he became famous</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s met them</p>
<p>in the last few years it</p>
<p>was ugly whatever the fuck happened to him you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna get the straight</p>
<p>story from him</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t make an andy dick</p>
<p>with love and attention and you</p>
<p>know you only</p>
<p>make one of</p>
<p>those with fucking horrible amounts of neglect</p>
<p>yeah yeah unfortunately</p>
<p>it was an evil geppetto that made</p>
<p>andy dick but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny how it works that way</p>
<p>well you have to have some sort of a fucked up life</p>
<p>to make a really</p>
<p>truly brilliantly</p>
<p>funny person</p>
<p>yeah like everyone that i know joe</p>
<p>yeah well i was</p>
<p>gonna say i usually say that the childhood</p>
<p>background for comedians</p>
<p>is basically the same as porn stars because</p>
<p>those comedians don&rsquo;t usually have the abs for porn</p>
<p>you of course go against</p>
<p>that rule i fuck up the</p>
<p>whole rule see you</p>
<p>could do porn</p>
<p>you wanted to</p>
<p>too thanks bro really</p>
<p>appreciate that yeah</p>
<p>back when there was</p>
<p>money in and i thought</p>
<p>about it yeah</p>
<p>i know now this</p>
<p>would be my way out of hollywood</p>
<p>just fucking do a porno and make millions</p>
<p>yeah jeff thought</p>
<p>about directing porn really</p>
<p>yeah do you remember the guy on newsradio</p>
<p>i do not remember his name</p>
<p>but he was a writer that also</p>
<p>wrote for porn</p>
<p>do you know i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>season one because i was living in</p>
<p>north hollywood</p>
<p>at the time</p>
<p>and he took me to a set</p>
<p>and it was i remember you telling you jill</p>
<p>kelly and janine yeah we went to a</p>
<p>lesbian shoot and it was</p>
<p>back in the vivid days when they were making a ton of</p>
<p>money because they were selling vhs tapes okay they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t even selling dvds back then yeah</p>
<p>was 94 right so we went to the set and it was so</p>
<p>oddly clinical</p>
<p>and weird and</p>
<p>girl janine who</p>
<p>wound up marrying jesse</p>
<p>james and having</p>
<p>kids with them</p>
<p>that was the woman</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;d kept</p>
<p>going i love my job</p>
<p>i love my job</p>
<p>and her job is you</p>
<p>know eating</p>
<p>pussy it was just so weird</p>
<p>no wait a minute i</p>
<p>would love that i</p>
<p>would love that job yeah you</p>
<p>think so apparently</p>
<p>causes cancer that&rsquo;s what just that yeah</p>
<p>if you get cancer</p>
<p>from eating</p>
<p>pussy you&rsquo;re a pussy</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>annoying though but</p>
<p>if i&rsquo;m gonna get</p>
<p>mouth cancer rather yet from</p>
<p>from from you know looking pussy</p>
<p>from back and</p>
<p>spitting in a cup what they&rsquo;re also saying now that the</p>
<p>coloring and coca cola</p>
<p>is causing cancer now</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>about why do they need to color coke</p>
<p>can it just be</p>
<p>clear and taste like that well</p>
<p>they really give a fuck</p>
<p>what it looks like great</p>
<p>and my favorite</p>
<p>thing is to</p>
<p>drink coca cola out of a pussy</p>
<p>right so i&rsquo;m fucked now</p>
<p>why do i even get out of bed yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s over yeah</p>

<p>that&rsquo;s crazy shit dude yeah</p>
<p>i had a wart on my lip</p>
<p>i got a wart on my lip from the comedy store</p>
<p>because the</p>
<p>microphone of the calming storm i</p>
<p>know this is what it&rsquo;s from from talking to people that</p>
<p>all these different</p>
<p>guys use it because there&rsquo;s a certain spot</p>
<p>where the microphone</p>
<p>would always</p>
<p>touch my lip i&rsquo;d always have the</p>
<p>microphone right here on my lip</p>
<p>and all of a sudden i</p>
<p>started getting</p>
<p>this fucking growth on my lip i&rsquo;m like what is this</p>
<p>and i went to a dermatologist</p>
<p>and they said</p>
<p>it was a wart and they burned a fucking wart off my lip</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s disgusting</p>
<p>disgusting from the fucking comedy</p>
<p>store thank god it</p>
<p>never came back yeah but</p>
<p>in that spot the</p>
<p>exact spot right here do you take up wipes now</p>
<p>wipes no i should</p>
<p>wipe i know</p>
<p>you know what i really got into probiotics i really</p>
<p>got into probiotics and i eat a lot of acidophilus and</p>
<p>i drink a lot of kombucha</p>
<p>tea yeah and</p>
<p>i started reading</p>
<p>about it that acidophilus is one of the most</p>
<p>aggressive bacterias healthy bacterias</p>
<p>and that it really is an excellent aid and it kills</p>
<p>other bacteria that it comes in contact with so</p>
<p>it literally coats your skin</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s on top of your skin so if any</p>
<p>cold bacteria or any</p>
<p>virus bacteria tries to</p>
<p>fuck with you it attacks it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really like having</p>
<p>your own healthy soldiers that live in your body yeah</p>
<p>and when i was not doing that</p>
<p>cause it sounds</p>
<p>gay when you</p>
<p>say it like that</p>
<p>soldiers yeah</p>
<p>in a good way</p>
<p>but when i wasn&rsquo;t doing it when i was</p>
<p>traveling a lot for the ufc</p>
<p>and for comedy i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>traveling all the time i was getting sick all the</p>
<p>time yeah and as soon as i really got on the kombucha</p>
<p>tea it killed it i</p>
<p>stopped i stopped getting sick</p>
<p>yeah i should learn to</p>
<p>stomach that stuff</p>
<p>kombucha yeah you don&rsquo;t like it</p>
<p>it just tastes like vinegar</p>
<p>yeah i think it</p>
<p>tastes good i enjoy it</p>
<p>well remember it was the and he was into kombucha</p>
<p>yeah yeah and they got</p>
<p>me into it yeah then he was also that</p>
<p>weird garlic diet</p>
<p>remember he</p>
<p>would eat them</p>
<p>yeah whole cloves of garlic yeah</p>
<p>and just smell so bad</p>

<p>about andy was he</p>
<p>would do massive amounts of drugs but he</p>
<p>would also take like</p>
<p>every herb known to man yeah</p>
<p>he would have like this</p>
<p>sorting his vitamins all day</p>

<p>to me everyone from news radio&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>family to me</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>yeah no doubt it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a very unusual bond that we all have you know</p>
<p>i steven root called me</p>
<p>a while back for some</p>
<p>party that he was thrown</p>
<p>and i couldn&rsquo;t make it i was</p>
<p>going out of town</p>

<p>other for years you know</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like but it</p>
<p>never feels like</p>
<p>but whenever i see anyone from news</p>
<p>radio it doesn&rsquo;t feel like any time has passed</p>
<p>you know dude you</p>
<p>should fucking</p>
<p>write something man put it together</p>

<p>even andy maybe</p>
<p>rescue andy</p>
<p>yeah dude news</p>
<p>radio by podcasting</p>
<p>yeah well there was one time we were</p>
<p>we were talking</p>
<p>about doing something we were on the set was when</p>
<p>brian callan played my brother</p>
<p>and we were talking</p>
<p>about doing something and you doing it we actually had</p>
<p>we talked about it&rsquo;s been over the yeah</p>
<p>the gorelli brothers yeah but we</p>
<p>never wind up doing anything yeah</p>
<p>which is always how</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like joey</p>
<p>yes i would like doing</p>
<p>using the i remember with brad</p>
<p>isaacs talking about</p>
<p>using the news radio cast</p>
<p>as like the</p>
<p>mercury theater players you know like a repertory</p>
<p>acting ensemble that you</p>
<p>would just like do like</p>
<p>you know just do like</p>
<p>independent</p>
<p>movies but it</p>
<p>would only be the cast of news</p>
<p>radio and all</p>
<p>these different</p>
<p>movies that</p>
<p>would be cool you know that</p>
<p>would have been a lot of fun we totally</p>
<p>should have done a newsradio</p>
<p>movie though</p>
<p>but it was never like</p>
<p>as i said it really wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>successful we</p>
<p>thought we were</p>
<p>canceled every</p>
<p>season every</p>
<p>season and that&rsquo;s why we</p>
<p>kept doing season finale</p>
<p>we kept doing serious</p>
<p>finals at the end of</p>
<p>every season</p>
<p>yeah they were they were so</p>
<p>crazy like the space one</p>
<p>yeah we do these the</p>
<p>titanic one we did a</p>
<p>titanic one</p>
<p>yeah the whole episode of the show</p>
<p>took place in a boat</p>

<p>great 3d photo of you</p>
<p>in the break room set that was in the</p>
<p>swimming pool</p>
<p>like with water up to here and that&rsquo;s the water</p>
<p>spraying past you</p>
<p>this is you trying to fix this</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great really cool</p>
<p>photo oh wow 3d</p>
<p>yeah to me man</p>
<p>can you email to me does it work like</p>
<p>that yeah i can</p>
<p>probably yeah i can probably scan it and you&rsquo;d have</p>
<p>i could scan it is like to</p>
<p>side by side images</p>
<p>so you went from that you you</p>
<p>start doing the poker show</p>
<p>you know and you did a</p>
<p>try to do a bunch of</p>
<p>pilots and then you decided</p>
<p>recently to</p>
<p>start doing</p>
<p>stand up again</p>
<p>yeah well actually</p>
<p>right after i</p>
<p>got the court rolling</p>
<p>i thought oh</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t have any you know i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m not making much</p>
<p>money these days</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>still making like</p>
<p>a decent living</p>
<p>but but not when you have to</p>
<p>pay 17 000 a</p>
<p>month i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about a quarter of what i need to earn to be broke um</p>
<p>so i figured well you know</p>
<p>maybe stand up</p>
<p>at least i can go out and you know</p>
<p>and if i can put an act together and</p>
<p>you know if somebody</p>
<p>told me said well if you got some tv if you got if you</p>
<p>got some name</p>
<p>recognition from being on tv you can go out and</p>
<p>do stand up and make money</p>
<p>you know and i said well you know</p>
<p>i guess you can you</p>
<p>said you don&rsquo;t even have to be good you just you know</p>
<p>people will come</p>
<p>after a little</p>
<p>while people will stop showing up but true</p>
<p>but i thought well all</p>
<p>right well i&rsquo;ll see if i can</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d get the word gets out of you</p>
<p>sought quicker</p>
<p>today than it ever has before</p>
<p>screech really couldn&rsquo;t have pulled it off if he</p>
<p>started out</p>
<p>today yeah yeah</p>
<p>now back in the day yeah we got the tour bit</p>
<p>steve i was</p>
<p>doing pretty good though he&rsquo;s just got thrown on</p>
<p>stage but i bet he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy did you</p>
<p>throw yourself</p>
<p>right on stage or did you kind of do like a</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know like</p>
<p>small places</p>
<p>first i&rsquo;m still doing that now i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>still like working up the act i&rsquo;m not like</p>
<p>going out and playing how long you been doing that</p>
<p>just since before christmas</p>
<p>and you told me friday</p>
<p>night when i talked to you that you were</p>
<p>gonna do 40 minutes i did</p>
<p>yeah i did set it</p>
<p>ucb i did i</p>
<p>guess i did almost</p>
<p>fifty minutes wow and</p>
<p>for how long you&rsquo;ve been doing comedy</p>
<p>since december before christmas yeah so just a few</p>
<p>months yeah a few</p>
<p>months and you did</p>
<p>forty fucking minutes or an hour</p>
<p>almost but forty</p>
<p>did about i</p>
<p>think they said between</p>
<p>forty five and</p>
<p>fifty minutes holy shit dude that&rsquo;s incredible yeah</p>
<p>so are you just</p>
<p>doing math and writing constantly no it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just like i kept just</p>
<p>going down and</p>
<p>doing like doing some sets of</p>
<p>place near my my</p>
<p>apartment and</p>
<p>bunch of other like</p>
<p>these sort of</p>
<p>alternative comedy shows downtown</p>
<p>and just sort of saying well you know</p>
<p>every time i get up i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>do like 20 minutes of new</p>
<p>stuff wow wow</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;ll try and</p>
<p>write 20 minutes of new</p>
<p>stuff for each time i get up</p>
<p>now when you write do</p>
<p>you sit down and go okay</p>
<p>today i&rsquo;m gonna write</p>
<p>stand up and do you just like go through the newspaper</p>
<p>or do you have some ideas that you&rsquo;ve already</p>
<p>developed or you already</p>
<p>considered rather</p>
<p>it be kinda like just i i actually</p>
<p>started like make keeping a few notes as i was like</p>
<p>going through the day or also just keeping</p>
<p>ideas in my head for something that i thought might be</p>
<p>funny sometimes</p>
<p>would be something that came up on the news you know</p>
<p>you know it was</p>
<p>weird but i wouldn&rsquo;t i kind of</p>
<p>decided that i wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>gonna do what i did when i was a kid i was gonna</p>
<p>write stuff out word for word i was just gonna like</p>
<p>have ideas about things that i</p>
<p>areas that i thought were funny</p>
<p>think it through my head</p>
<p>about what what i would want to cover</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d have some jokes in my head</p>
<p>and i make notes or</p>
<p>point form notes i wouldn&rsquo;t let myself write</p>
<p>out the jokes in</p>
<p>whole just point form</p>
<p>and to try and keep it from feeling like i was</p>
<p>like reading a monologue</p>
<p>right yeah like doing a theat</p>
<p>doing like you</p>
<p>know i didn&rsquo;t want it to feel like acting</p>
<p>yeah that is the</p>
<p>trick of comedy</p>
<p>i very rarely</p>
<p>write out jokes in like you</p>
<p>know so the</p>
<p>other day i&rsquo;m at the zoo</p>
<p>i very rarely do that i mean i&rsquo;m almost</p>
<p>never every now</p>
<p>and then i do it as a goof like as a practice</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;ll sit</p>
<p>instead of right just writing</p>
<p>just random</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll sit and go okay i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna try to</p>
<p>write a bit and i&rsquo;ve done it i&rsquo;ve done it a few times</p>
<p>but most of the time i just</p>
<p>write i just sit down</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ll write for</p>
<p>and a lot of it might be</p>
<p>depressing and</p>
<p>apocalyptic and then it&rsquo;ll be one</p>
<p>fucking one paragraph</p>
<p>chunk and i&rsquo;m like holy shit that&rsquo;s a bit you know</p>
<p>3 000 words or</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s this one paragraph that i bet that&rsquo;s a bit</p>
<p>know so do you do you do that do you just</p>
<p>write randomly or do you</p>
<p>write like specific</p>
<p>like how do you like when you sit down to write</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s i guess</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m weird because that just</p>
<p>lot of times the</p>
<p>the german fit will be just something that i&rsquo;ve said</p>
<p>like in conversation all the time you know i did it too</p>
<p>like something</p>
<p>you know something</p>
<p>says man i&rsquo;ll just like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll go off and i&rsquo;ll go off</p>
<p>for a few minutes on something and i go that&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>yeah i can work that into something and</p>
<p>you just have to remember it</p>
<p>worse is when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in the middle of a conversation like stop</p>
<p>please don&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna write this</p>
<p>down before i forget it you know yeah</p>
<p>now i have to pee can i do that</p>
<p>sure yeah can</p>
<p>i get right in there should i</p>
<p>bring this with me no</p>
<p>go right ahead okay just walk</p>
<p>right down there</p>
<p>you guys go</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna fill the time</p>
<p>brian actually</p>
<p>has recently</p>
<p>started doing</p>
<p>stand up comedy as well and</p>
<p>our fucking feed</p>
<p>froze on ustream</p>
<p>but what else is new</p>
<p>people are constantly complaining about that</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think you stream</p>
<p>is designed for a couple thousand people at a time</p>
<p>right yeah i don&rsquo;t know what it is</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t really know well we have</p>
<p>brian anyway what i was saying</p>
<p>brian fucking killed it this weekend in brea</p>
<p>you hit a new milestone this weekend new</p>
<p>step give me</p>
<p>some new step up and</p>
<p>definitely figured something out the</p>
<p>saturday show on</p>
<p>we were talking</p>
<p>about how interesting it is that he gets this</p>
<p>weird opportunity to do stand up</p>
<p>where he did</p>
<p>stand up a bunch of years ago and</p>
<p>did the bob hope joke</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve all talked</p>
<p>about on the podcast before</p>
<p>if you haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>heard the joke he got up in</p>
<p>front of a room full of old people and said do you</p>
<p>think when bob hope died they flew out his body to</p>
<p>entertain all the dead</p>
<p>troops to iraq</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>it bombed so bad he stopped doing</p>
<p>stand up for</p>
<p>like five years more than that actually i was thinking</p>
<p>about that the timing i</p>
<p>think was more</p>
<p>because it was when bob hoped i was was like 200</p>
<p>three i don&rsquo;t remember but then i didn&rsquo;t get back</p>
<p>until like this</p>
<p>year so well you did a little bit at one</p>
<p>point in time remember i mean i</p>
<p>threw you up in atlanta</p>
<p>you went up oh</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>right yeah you got a new</p>
<p>girlfriend and you quit</p>
<p>again yeah that was like for like a</p>
<p>month or two i did it</p>
<p>relationships</p>
<p>would get you yeah relationships</p>
<p>would get you and then you just</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have the time yeah well</p>
<p>right now i can&rsquo;t even imagine</p>
<p>being in that same relationship</p>
<p>cause i pretty much do</p>
<p>stand up once or</p>
<p>twice a night now and i</p>
<p>have podcast on top of it like i&rsquo;ve been up this is my</p>
<p>second podcast</p>
<p>today i have another one</p>
<p>right after this you seem so much happier too</p>
<p>but not just</p>
<p>yeah not just</p>
<p>being out of the relationship but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting a chance to express yourself</p>
<p>now in a way that you didn&rsquo;t get a chance to do before</p>
<p>back then all you</p>
<p>could do is make your</p>
<p>funny videos</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>and that you know</p>
<p>making those videos</p>
<p>to killed me</p>
<p>i mean that</p>
<p>sitting in front of by yourself editing for</p>
<p>you know till five in the morning every</p>
<p>night just and then you did that all week that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>as creative as that is it&rsquo;s such a slow process</p>
<p>and it makes you just</p>
<p>like i was not talking to anybody i think</p>
<p>part of the problem is that you&rsquo;re a real</p>
<p>perfectionist you know we just took like some of these</p>
<p>things and edit them together sort of like the way dana</p>
<p>white guy does it for his</p>
<p>video blogs</p>
<p>like we should put a</p>
<p>video together of something like i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if you saw on twitter i put up</p>
<p>on twitter i put a tweet</p>
<p>video of you going on</p>
<p>stage last night</p>
<p>i think we just need to keep on doing that shit</p>
<p>you know what i</p>
<p>mean at all</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll find it and i&rsquo;ll retweet</p>
<p>it yeah we need to do more videos</p>
<p>when i originally hired</p>
<p>brian that&rsquo;s what his job was right</p>
<p>a video guy yeah</p>
<p>podcast co host</p>
<p>slash stand up comedian</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re getting more listeners with podcasts than the</p>
<p>videos way more</p>
<p>but i think you have an immense</p>
<p>talent when it comes to editing</p>
<p>video that you know i mean just not being served</p>
<p>brian has actually</p>
<p>just started doing</p>
<p>stand up himself</p>
<p>he did it a long time ago and took a</p>
<p>bunch of years off and then</p>
<p>got back into it again so</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s why i thought this</p>
<p>subject is very fascinating to me that the</p>
<p>starting of the routine</p>
<p>do you feel comfortable on stage yeah</p>
<p>as i said it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird because</p>
<p>i took 30 years off</p>
<p>doing stand up</p>
<p>you know how</p>
<p>and it is feeling comfortable because</p>
<p>i know in the past when i&rsquo;ve liked done hosting gigs</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve always felt a little phony</p>
<p>you know right</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>impersonating someone doing</p>
<p>stand up yeah</p>
<p>and so i think coming at it with a looser format</p>
<p>like going on</p>
<p>stage and just</p>
<p>trusting myself to have</p>
<p>areas that i want to go into and</p>
<p>trusting myself to be funny</p>
<p>uh is has been fun</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s been fun</p>
<p>to go up and like find out what the bits are on stage</p>
<p>yeah in a lot of ways</p>
<p>yeah and that is the</p>
<p>thing about</p>
<p>stand up is like there&rsquo;s a totally different</p>
<p>thing when it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>front of a live audience and you&rsquo;re trying to get</p>
<p>laughs and your</p>
<p>voice is amplified</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all there you feel</p>
<p>their energy looking</p>
<p>at you and you know different synapses fire yeah</p>
<p>well if you were in a social setting</p>
<p>and someone talked for 45 minutes straight without</p>
<p>letting anyone else talk you</p>
<p>would just think even no matter how</p>
<p>entertaining they were</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be like what an asshole</p>
<p>you know i talk</p>
<p>about this on</p>
<p>stage it&rsquo;s the most</p>
<p>ridiculous i say that</p>
<p>stand up is the most</p>
<p>ridiculous job you</p>
<p>could ever want to have i</p>
<p>wanna be the only one who talks for an hour</p>
<p>and i wanna have my</p>
<p>voice amplified way</p>
<p>above everyone else&rsquo;s and i</p>
<p>wanna be lit</p>
<p>yeah it would be well lit</p>
<p>while everyone else is in the dark</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also weird just</p>
<p>cause like growing</p>
<p>up i was always the person trying to make everyone</p>
<p>laugh though i was like</p>
<p>the you know</p>
<p>that was what i love doing is trying to make people</p>
<p>laugh like in my high</p>
<p>school and middle</p>
<p>school and stuff like that so i kind of see like</p>
<p>class clown</p>
<p>comedian type</p>
<p>thing i see that also it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s not like trying to</p>
<p>take over everybody and be on a</p>
<p>microphone stand you&rsquo;re just trying to make people</p>
<p>happy there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>most certainly a</p>
<p>bunch of different types of people that become</p>
<p>stand up comedians you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know i mean to say that it always comes from one</p>
<p>place that&rsquo;s not really true like yeah</p>
<p>i had felt it</p>
<p>just never comes from a good</p>
<p>place no exactly</p>
<p>because you</p>
<p>never a huge</p>
<p>vista of bad</p>
<p>places i had always</p>
<p>felt like for a long time like there was something</p>
<p>about me that wasn&rsquo;t legitimate</p>
<p>that i wasn&rsquo;t a</p>
<p>legitimate comic</p>
<p>because i wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>the same guy as everybody else i wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>afraid of people i</p>
<p>grew up doing martial arts and fighting</p>
<p>and i went from</p>
<p>fighting you know</p>
<p>to stand up and then it was like this weird</p>
<p>thing like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>what am i this weird jock</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s doing comic</p>
<p>who the fuck am i</p>
<p>what is but</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t just life has to suck</p>
<p>and then you have to make</p>
<p>funny out of the suck</p>
<p>you know your life</p>
<p>could suck in all kinds of</p>
<p>weird ways you know</p>
<p>like joe pete johansson&rsquo;s life suck was</p>
<p>his father used to beat the fuck out of him you know</p>
<p>and everybody&rsquo;s as different mine was you know being</p>
<p>abandoned by my father you know everybody does have</p>
<p>their own little</p>
<p>weird thing that you&rsquo;re trying to make up for with that</p>
<p>exorbitant amount of attention you request on stage</p>
<p>you know yeah</p>
<p>but if you don&rsquo;t do if you don&rsquo;t have some fucking</p>
<p>weird need you</p>
<p>never really get there</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t know anyone</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and i shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>say this because of course it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>for someone to be a</p>
<p>great comedian with a happy</p>
<p>childhood it must be</p>
<p>i mean if you&rsquo;re just really</p>
<p>smart and figure it out</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;ve never met that i just don&rsquo;t know um</p>
<p>yeah today&rsquo;s my name</p>
<p>my childhood is pretty good</p>
<p>i mean my biggest problem is bullies and just</p>
<p>shit like that</p>
<p>but even that</p>
<p>is a big issue</p>
<p>family wise yeah dude that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>only reason why i got into martial arts i didn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>into martial arts because i wanted to risk my fucking</p>
<p>brain cells and go out there i was terrified of</p>
<p>other kids i</p>
<p>moved around a lot when i was a kid and we</p>
<p>moved everywhere</p>
<p>basically every</p>
<p>three years we move to a new place yeah</p>
<p>i did that too yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>thing i mean</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have a stability</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>stable so you feel this need to</p>
<p>express yourself exorbitantly you know you have to</p>
<p>you know get more attention than you deserve you know</p>
<p>yeah i had a</p>
<p>drunk dad who</p>
<p>was also diagnosed as borderline personality disorder</p>
<p>jesus yeah fuck</p>
<p>dude i found that</p>
<p>when my wife has play with</p>
<p>that told my mom</p>
<p>well she&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>diagnosed with borderline personality disorder</p>
<p>mom goes oh that&rsquo;s what they said your dad had</p>
<p>oh my god really must</p>
<p>so you breach all</p>
<p>these subjects on stage</p>
<p>yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>about maybe 25</p>
<p>of it&rsquo;s like about</p>
<p>my personal life and</p>
<p>stuff another</p>
<p>and then maybe more</p>
<p>maybe maybe 35</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re free</p>
<p>and then the rest is about</p>
<p>you know life</p>
<p>about life yeah</p>
<p>that other thing your free wednesday</p>

<p>happy when someone said they love news radio</p>
<p>yeah yeah it&rsquo;s like you know</p>
<p>i hate you and your prostitution gig but</p>
<p>you were awesome when you were doing that</p>
<p>other thing no</p>
<p>fear fact it was always just</p>
<p>funny to me because it was all the way through news</p>
<p>radio you always said</p>
<p>next gig i do is just</p>
<p>called joe gets paid i don&rsquo;t give a fuck what it is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just me blowing it dude i don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>as long as it&rsquo;s just joe gets paid</p>
<p>i was recruiting everyone i was like yeah</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just gonna</p>
<p>drink coffee</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>gonna run the cameras and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be called joe gets paid</p>
<p>yeah yeah just</p>
<p>ridiculous it really</p>
<p>wound up happening it&rsquo;s like the secret man</p>
<p>i manifested it</p>
<p>you sent the message out to the universe i did</p>
<p>dude i believe in that man</p>
<p>yeah i believe you can do that</p>
<p>did you have any</p>
<p>experience with people who were hooked on the</p>
<p>secret do you remember when i</p>
<p>became a huge</p>
<p>yeah and not so much it was like</p>
<p>i remember mostly i remember it was like</p>
<p>my well my ex wife chrissy</p>
<p>she went she was like wanted to see the the film and i</p>
<p>said well all right but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and people talk you know people talk about the</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s scientific</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;d have</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing fucking scientific about it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s complete bullshit it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like rodney allen</p>
<p>rippy fucking</p>
<p>power positive thinking bullshit it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know and it&rsquo;s like if you really think that so</p>
<p>yeah so every</p>
<p>child dies of starvation</p>
<p>just wasn&rsquo;t putting out enough positive energy</p>
<p>you know i had an argument with a friend of mine</p>
<p>that was so</p>
<p>into it so into it i go okay you ready for this</p>
<p>babies die in drive bys</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on there yeah are they manifesting the</p>
<p>wrong reality that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>sending a positive energy to the universe they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not they&rsquo;re not you know what they&rsquo;re not really</p>
<p>thinking about what they want out of life</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so ridiculous and so culty but the fascinating</p>
<p>thing is you know that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s confirmation bias like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>only looking at what you what what supports your case</p>
<p>yeah and there&rsquo;s a bunch of people that are</p>
<p>successful and they&rsquo;re saying well</p>
<p>i envisioned it and that&rsquo;s how i became</p>
<p>successful yeah</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re the fucking people</p>
<p>that envisioned it and they&rsquo;re poor as shit right now</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going i don&rsquo;t get it what&rsquo;s happening it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re only</p>
<p>using the people that are</p>
<p>successful yeah</p>
<p>you got to show me a dude who&rsquo;s fucking starving</p>
<p>and then you</p>
<p>apply it to him and then he goes out in the</p>
<p>world and then you come back</p>
<p>in 15 years and go okay well look the guys are</p>
<p>successful and</p>
<p>you got to show me at</p>
<p>least a thousand</p>
<p>people more yeah you</p>
<p>got if you take a hundred you got to have at</p>
<p>least more than 50 of them</p>
<p>yeah succeed</p>
<p>for it to be</p>
<p>you know statistically meaning one out of a thousand</p>
<p>you know and that one is wants to let you know the</p>
<p>secret that it&rsquo;s all simple</p>
<p>you just gotta</p>
<p>think positive</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like any religion</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like any religion</p>
<p>where people want to believe</p>
<p>that they can do something</p>
<p>that will give them</p>
<p>power over the rest of</p>
<p>creation yeah</p>
<p>you know the rest of creation is</p>
<p>gonna somehow fall into line with</p>
<p>their wishes</p>
<p>because they prayed to god</p>
<p>or they sent out positive energy</p>
<p>you know i think it&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>though and it&rsquo;s very unfortunate that this craze</p>
<p>is so discredited and so</p>
<p>the place where they&rsquo;re coming from is so illogical</p>
<p>because the concept of</p>
<p>thinking healthy</p>
<p>and positive is very important for formulating</p>
<p>a good life for</p>
<p>figuring out</p>
<p>how to be connected to the</p>
<p>right kind of people and how to send the</p>
<p>right kind of energy out</p>
<p>so that you you foster</p>
<p>healthy relationships and</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing and</p>
<p>pursuing in life is something that you get</p>
<p>motivation out</p>
<p>of or rather that you get satisfaction out of</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m feeling</p>
<p>yeah having a positive outlook</p>
<p>is healthy it</p>
<p>is better for you</p>
<p>you know i mean you know</p>
<p>jesus i mean</p>
<p>i think living with my</p>
<p>first wife you know</p>
<p>it was just negative</p>
<p>about everything</p>
<p>everything was negative</p>
<p>it is horrible for you yes</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve been there i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>there many times in relationships and in friendships</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve had friendships</p>
<p>where the people were negative and you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>you get away from them it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>catching your breath you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>what is this person doing to me they&rsquo;re fucking they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>draining me they&rsquo;re doing something to me</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s definitely positive</p>
<p>yeah being positive that part is</p>
<p>great yeah and</p>
<p>there is science</p>
<p>behind that yes they&rsquo;re keeping a positive attitude</p>
<p>keeps you healthier keeps your immune</p>
<p>system functioning better</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve seen it i&rsquo;ve seen positive and negative</p>
<p>thinking during a dmt trip</p>
<p>i had a during a</p>
<p>psychedelic trip i had this</p>
<p>weird moment</p>
<p>where i was</p>
<p>thinking all</p>
<p>these negative</p>
<p>things because</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>trips are just so out of control they&rsquo;re so beyond</p>
<p>bizarre and they&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>incredibly like</p>
<p>like self examinatory</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s not even a word but you know you&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>introspective you&rsquo;re looking at</p>
<p>so many different</p>
<p>aspects of your life like at a million</p>
<p>miles an hour that</p>
<p>you can you can get like</p>
<p>a negative thought and they can blow away and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where bad trips come from</p>
<p>yeah so in the middle of this negative thought this</p>
<p>i saw this dmt is a very visionary</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>experience and you have a</p>
<p>weird black</p>
<p>dark fucking</p>
<p>nasty dark green and dark</p>
<p>black patterns and</p>
<p>colors and then</p>
<p>in the middle of it i realized</p>
<p>what i was doing i realized that i was being negative</p>
<p>and i took a deep breath and i let go and</p>
<p>i became positive decided to</p>
<p>think positive and</p>
<p>it blossomed like flowers in</p>
<p>front of me and</p>
<p>the colors changed</p>
<p>and they all became bright and beautiful</p>
<p>and vibrant</p>
<p>and it became</p>
<p>light and the patterns became beautiful</p>
<p>and i was like wow this is like a lesson i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>learning from a</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>experience about</p>
<p>the real physical manifestation of negative</p>
<p>and positive thoughts that they actually have a real</p>
<p>effect well</p>
<p>fact they said</p>
<p>that if you just</p>
<p>force yourself to smile</p>
<p>you can reduce</p>
<p>depression yeah</p>
<p>like your depression will fade a little not</p>
<p>all the way if you&rsquo;re really depressed but if you can</p>
<p>force yourself to smile</p>
<p>yeah i really like put on a big demo like</p>
<p>you just keep it there long enough</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll help your</p>
<p>brain reacts as though you&rsquo;re happy</p>
<p>yeah your brain</p>
<p>starts to release the same chemicals it</p>
<p>would if you were actually</p>
<p>happy it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like so it&rsquo;s like you know</p>
<p>the mind body</p>
<p>connection is true it really is real</p>
<p>what we are is the most fascinating organic</p>
<p>computer that&rsquo;s ever been created</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t have a fucking single book</p>
<p>on how to use the operating</p>
<p>system correctly</p>
<p>just the bible joe just the</p>
<p>bible yes i mean</p>
<p>we are all we are all raised by people who are</p>
<p>completely clueless as to how to</p>
<p>raise someone</p>
<p>i mean almost</p>
<p>every one of us</p>
<p>yeah and so we develop and you can get in</p>
<p>these patterns of</p>
<p>thinking that your parents have you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know if you grow up around like</p>
<p>mrs rogan has a very negative parents</p>
<p>especially her mom her mom had a very hard life</p>
<p>and her mom is one of</p>
<p>those that you can&rsquo;t tell her a good</p>
<p>thing well this is just</p>
<p>gonna happen it&rsquo;s just gonna fall</p>
<p>apart and what happens here</p>
<p>and then what happens there</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>and jessica</p>
<p>whoops her name</p>
<p>has managed to avoid it</p>
<p>but for the most part it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like if you if you develop in a family a</p>
<p>household that a</p>
<p>bunch of negative</p>
<p>motherfuckers</p>
<p>like that shit can</p>
<p>it becomes like a</p>
<p>like a path that you get on it becomes a</p>
<p>track you know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on this</p>
<p>track i grew up in family</p>
<p>where everyone else might like</p>
<p>actually my</p>
<p>older brother&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>that way but the rest of my family they&rsquo;re always like</p>
<p>well whatever you do the</p>
<p>system&rsquo;s gonna get you</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stacked against you this you can&rsquo;t win</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s you know i</p>
<p>think part of that is my</p>
<p>mother was working</p>
<p>class english</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s way that</p>
<p>you know all working</p>
<p>class english</p>
<p>are raised you know</p>
<p>so you know well</p>
<p>try what you</p>
<p>will but you really can&rsquo;t get away from it you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all stacked</p>
<p>against you so</p>
<p>goddamn difficult to manufacture an awesome environment</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s been one of my main</p>
<p>focuses as a</p>
<p>grown up as an adult</p>
<p>is to try to manufacture</p>
<p>the most positive</p>
<p>atmosphere possible both</p>
<p>in work and friendships and relationships and</p>
<p>everything that i do</p>
<p>try to like</p>
<p>steer it towards the most positive</p>
<p>place possible</p>
<p>you know and so you can your life</p>
<p>can be really fucking awesome if you do that correctly</p>
<p>and it can suck real bad if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>yeah yeah you know but the secret</p>
<p>not too much is</p>
<p>bullshit well it</p>
<p>sounds i mean i</p>
<p>believe that</p>
<p>anything that makes you feel like you have</p>
<p>any control over your destiny is an illusion because</p>
<p>you know people</p>
<p>think well i you know i make good choices so good</p>
<p>things happen</p>
<p>and i go well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still just pure luck because</p>
<p>every single day you are tied up in a</p>
<p>chain reaction of millions</p>
<p>of choices that are being made all around you every day</p>
<p>and all it has to be is one of</p>
<p>those choices be</p>
<p>someone wants to</p>
<p>shoot you in the head</p>
<p>right and that&rsquo;s the choice that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna shape your destiny</p>
<p>yeah so and any day that someone doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>shoot you in the head</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s just luck</p>
<p>or a guy with a vest wants to blow up a cafe</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re writing your novel yeah</p>
<p>or somebody</p>
<p>sneezes while dry</p>
<p>thing and goes over the</p>
<p>curve yeah or texas</p>
<p>slams into you and you die</p>
<p>yeah for sure yeah i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been considering this idea over the last few years</p>
<p>especially that the entire</p>
<p>life that we</p>
<p>live is sort of like a mathematical program</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like this</p>
<p>giant algorithm that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>far too complex</p>
<p>for us to really wrap our heads around it</p>
<p>but that all</p>
<p>these different motions and all these</p>
<p>emotions and actions and all</p>
<p>these different</p>
<p>things and circumstances</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>really like integers that it&rsquo;s already</p>
<p>a part of something that&rsquo;s creating</p>
<p>something else it&rsquo;s like information theory yeah</p>
<p>yeah it was the idea</p>
<p>that the universe is nothing but information it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>that the universe the entire universe is just</p>
<p>an information storage device</p>
<p>it makes sense i mean</p>
<p>when you look at the direction that</p>
<p>humanity is in is another</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>absolutely fascinating to me i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>completely fascinated with the idea of the singularity</p>
<p>and with the idea of you know i mean even</p>
<p>the idea of end times</p>
<p>the idea of an</p>
<p>apocalyptic scenario you know</p>
<p>you look at like what</p>
<p>human beings are doing i equate</p>
<p>human beings to being some</p>
<p>weird sort of a caterpillar</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna turn into a butterfly</p>
<p>so we are absolutely obsessed with the newest</p>
<p>greatest technological</p>
<p>innovations and</p>
<p>eventually that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pushing to a certain direction and that direction is</p>
<p>some sort of a redefinition of life as we know it</p>
<p>yeah i think i was thought that eventually the</p>
<p>earth itself</p>
<p>would develop its own consciousness if it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t already have you know</p>
<p>yeah it may already there&rsquo;s actually a theory called</p>
<p>the theory of the noosphere</p>
<p>which is that the</p>
<p>earth is enveloped in a</p>
<p>just like the stratosphere that there&rsquo;s a noosphere</p>
<p>which is a sphere of knowledge</p>
<p>of information</p>
<p>and that this noosphere</p>
<p>exists around the</p>
<p>earth and that</p>
<p>people can tap into it</p>
<p>yeah well not even</p>
<p>just around the</p>
<p>earth that it&rsquo;s a dimension around you all the time yes</p>
<p>the idea of the</p>
<p>muse is that what you&rsquo;re really doing when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re being</p>
<p>completely creative is that you are just an antenna</p>
<p>to pull in all this information that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>tesla had said</p>
<p>tesla who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the greatest inventor ever</p>
<p>was believed that he was receiving signals from</p>
<p>other life forms that were</p>
<p>giving him this information and now of course the weird</p>
<p>thing is that</p>
<p>physicists are</p>
<p>starting to toy with</p>
<p>these ideas yeah</p>
<p>the idea of</p>
<p>entanglement and the idea of</p>
<p>sure the idea</p>
<p>of consciousness being non local</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>that your entire body is actually a sort of some</p>
<p>weird sort of an antenna</p>
<p>and that you know the hormones and</p>
<p>you know adrenaline and all</p>
<p>these different</p>
<p>things and you run</p>
<p>all the biological instincts</p>
<p>that are there to keep the physical body alive</p>
<p>are no it&rsquo;s no more than like maintenance</p>
<p>cycles that you have to run on a bmw yeah</p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s a lot have you read</p>
<p>about the princeton did this huge</p>
<p>multi year study of</p>
<p>mine machine interface</p>
<p>no but basically that attention affects machines</p>
<p>and they did</p>
<p>these studies where</p>
<p>they used a</p>
<p>random number generator oh okay i did hear</p>
<p>about those yeah and they just</p>
<p>had a random number generator and they had people just</p>
<p>focus not anything specific just</p>
<p>focus on the machine itself</p>
<p>the more and the more people</p>
<p>focused on the machine</p>
<p>the less random the machine became it became really</p>
<p>started having non</p>
<p>random patterns</p>
<p>human consciousness is something we</p>
<p>completely don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s energy that comes out of people sometimes</p>
<p>that is absolutely</p>
<p>tangible we just don&rsquo;t have a device to measure it well</p>
<p>the other thing they did they set up</p>
<p>these random number</p>
<p>generators all around the world</p>
<p>and so they set them all around the</p>
<p>world and then just coincidentally</p>
<p>9 11 happened</p>
<p>because they had a theory that if</p>
<p>large numbers of people were</p>
<p>thinking about the same event</p>
<p>that that would have a larger impact on</p>
<p>these machines</p>
<p>and they found</p>
<p>the correlation they found that</p>
<p>at the time of 9 11</p>
<p>when you know the</p>
<p>towers fell</p>
<p>these machines all around the</p>
<p>world started</p>
<p>generating non</p>
<p>random sequences of numbers</p>
<p>wow and what does that mean just that</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>the only know is this is like the men that</p>
<p>their attention</p>
<p>is that just the</p>
<p>effect of everyone</p>
<p>paying attention to the same event</p>
<p>affected these machines</p>
<p>okay so what you&rsquo;re saying is that all</p>
<p>these people were supposed to be</p>
<p>paying attention to the machines and then the event</p>
<p>of 9 11 happened and because it was such a huge event</p>
<p>all these people were</p>
<p>focusing on that and then the numbers</p>
<p>stopped being</p>
<p>random the event</p>
<p>yeah just all the fact that people were all</p>
<p>focused on the same event</p>
<p>affected these machines</p>
<p>wow it&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s a fascinating shit yeah and they</p>
<p>found it the same</p>
<p>thing they actually also</p>
<p>found out that</p>
<p>in canada was in canada the</p>
<p>prime minister</p>
<p>trudeau&rsquo;s funeral</p>
<p>from canada</p>
<p>that when his son was giving the eulogy that there was</p>
<p>an effect cause</p>
<p>you had almost</p>
<p>every single person in canada</p>
<p>listening to the</p>
<p>speech you know</p>
<p>you know the idea</p>
<p>is really fascinating to me</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re familiar with</p>
<p>ray kurzweil</p>
<p>do you know that yeah</p>
<p>yeah similarities near</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the number one proponent of the</p>
<p>idea of the intelligent computer eventually taking over</p>
<p>yeah and that&rsquo;s what he</p>
<p>deems a singularity to be and what he</p>
<p>thinks is that</p>
<p>what immortality is</p>
<p>gonna be is you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be able to download your</p>
<p>consciousness into some sort of a computer yeah and</p>
<p>you know it</p>
<p>sounds completely ridiculous</p>
<p>until you start</p>
<p>thinking about the</p>
<p>what the fuck</p>
<p>is consciousness and what if they can recreate it</p>
<p>you know what if you can recreate</p>
<p>and create an artificial version</p>
<p>of consciousness</p>
<p>down to the</p>
<p>point of it being non</p>
<p>local down to the</p>
<p>point of this</p>
<p>computer that you&rsquo;ve created being</p>
<p>an antenna to tune in</p>
<p>this new sort of consciousness yeah</p>
<p>well it was</p>
<p>i remember once</p>
<p>they were talking about</p>
<p>that if computers continue to advance to the</p>
<p>right they&rsquo;re doing i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if it was chris well</p>
<p>it puts forward to it the idea that</p>
<p>that eventually they&rsquo;ll be a computer</p>
<p>powerful enough to have</p>
<p>stored in its memory banks</p>
<p>every single event</p>
<p>that has occurred</p>
<p>since the big bang</p>
<p>which mean like</p>
<p>every event in</p>
<p>every human being&rsquo;s life every</p>
<p>every interaction of matter</p>
<p>throughout the universe</p>
<p>could be stored on a single computer</p>
<p>and could be</p>
<p>extrapolated</p>
<p>based on the current events and</p>
<p>and he said that the program itself</p>
<p>would not be able to distinguish itself</p>
<p>from the original</p>
<p>wow so each of us</p>
<p>would be programmed into this computer&rsquo;s memory bank</p>
<p>and the program</p>
<p>of us would not be able to distinguish itself</p>
<p>from the original</p>
<p>which means that</p>
<p>right now we</p>
<p>might already be that program</p>
<p>a billion years in the future</p>
<p>so we may very well be some sort of a parallel</p>
<p>reality but we</p>
<p>may have lived our actual</p>
<p>carbon based life</p>
<p>a billion years ago</p>
<p>and right now we</p>
<p>might just be</p>
<p>the computer program being run a billion years later</p>
<p>whoa what a mind fuck</p>
<p>i saw a trip yeah</p>
<p>i saw a glitch in the</p>
<p>matrix the other day and this is kind of like this</p>
<p>i was outside and it was the moon and there was</p>
<p>these clouds</p>
<p>going over it</p>
<p>after a rainstorm right</p>
<p>and have you ever seen like on</p>
<p>satellite tv</p>
<p>where darker</p>
<p>scenes like</p>
<p>blacks and grays they&rsquo;re not just</p>
<p>black or gray that&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>blocky like boxes</p>
<p>i was looking at that</p>
<p>and it was doing that</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>why am i seeing blocky</p>
<p>your eyes are programmed</p>
<p>to see that i don&rsquo;t know yeah</p>
<p>do i see so much computer and tv that i</p>
<p>was doing but it was really like i was staring at going</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no reason</p>
<p>those are squares</p>
<p>those are blocks</p>
<p>like the shadowing was off</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m thinking wait a</p>
<p>second this</p>
<p>is some kind of glitch my friend</p>
<p>my friend duncan hit me with the</p>
<p>ultimate mind fuck once and that is the theory that you</p>
<p>that your life like as the</p>
<p>world gets more</p>
<p>and more fucked up and more more chaotic and you worry</p>
<p>about the future of the world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really your own mortality that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>tripping on that you have created this entire</p>
<p>universe around you</p>
<p>and even though</p>
<p>it seems real because there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of people in your life that also seem real</p>
<p>they exist in your</p>
<p>dream as much as you exist in</p>
<p>theirs and it&rsquo;s all some sort of a</p>
<p>symbiotic connection</p>
<p>but that you live and are reborn constantly and then</p>
<p>every time something happens to you whether it&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>sort of a fucking</p>
<p>car accident</p>
<p>some you die in a</p>
<p>building collapse anything that happens</p>
<p>you immediately</p>
<p>forget on forget it and you are</p>
<p>transported into another situation</p>
<p>where you already have this life going on</p>
<p>and you just step in</p>
<p>and just keep</p>
<p>going and then it never ends</p>
<p>and there is no death</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just a constant cycle</p>
<p>until you get your shit together</p>
<p>until you completely and totally evolve and</p>
<p>and that this illusion</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve been around for</p>
<p>you know 40 years or 50 years it&rsquo;s all nonsense</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been around forever</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been around forever that&rsquo;s the old soul</p>
<p>notion yeah</p>
<p>we have a very</p>
<p>limited amount of memories that we can access</p>
<p>about this life that we&rsquo;re pretty sure happened</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>yeah and none of them that we can</p>
<p>access during the sleep time</p>
<p>just imagine if someone came up with a drug</p>
<p>that would allow you to remember your</p>
<p>sleep and details</p>
<p>remember your</p>
<p>dreams in absolute i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t want to see half the</p>
<p>show i went</p>
<p>fucking all</p>
<p>ari was talking</p>
<p>today how he had a</p>
<p>dream the other day</p>
<p>about having sex with his</p>
<p>sister and i&rsquo;m like oh</p>
<p>see that&rsquo;s the kind</p>
<p>of shit i don&rsquo;t want to even know that i&rsquo;m dreaming</p>
<p>about you know yeah</p>
<p>did he say it was good yeah</p>
<p>he said it came a couple of times</p>
<p>nice so dave if anybody wants to go see you perform</p>
<p>where can they how</p>
<p>can they get a hold of you i know your twitter is dave</p>
<p>s foley f o l e y</p>
<p>yeah and how can</p>
<p>they get a hold of you do you have a website no i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>well i&rsquo;ve got facebook but that&rsquo;s kind of useless we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to get a day</p>
<p>fully website if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do stand up</p>
<p>right now just the twitter and</p>
<p>and so the plan is to</p>
<p>do some gigs put together</p>
<p>a set and then</p>
<p>go touring and then yeah and then actually</p>
<p>start playing actual comedy clubs</p>
<p>are you ready i mean do you felt like you did this</p>
<p>thing the other</p>
<p>night how it had to go</p>
<p>it went well it was like</p>
<p>i underestimated</p>
<p>the amount of</p>
<p>stuff that i had in my notes</p>
<p>so i was like</p>
<p>about 15 minutes shy</p>
<p>when i got you know then i went all</p>
<p>right and so i</p>
<p>just sort of pulled out some</p>
<p>other stuff</p>
<p>i was working on okay</p>
<p>but i had like notes</p>
<p>that i hadn&rsquo;t timed out so i decided</p>
<p>well i think this is gonna be</p>
<p>about 45 minutes of</p>
<p>stuff right in</p>
<p>these notes it turned out to be half an hour</p>
<p>yeah yeah and</p>
<p>so then i had to</p>
<p>quickly just</p>
<p>grab another bit that i hadn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>planned to do as well as i</p>
<p>could remember it</p>
<p>and then improvise a little did you record your set</p>
<p>yeah yeah so</p>
<p>your main motivation</p>
<p>initially was just financial</p>
<p>but now you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>enjoying it</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m enjoying it it feels good to</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never been a person</p>
<p>who really craves performing</p>
<p>you know you know i can</p>
<p>enjoy it but i</p>
<p>never like i</p>
<p>never get this</p>
<p>thing oh i got to be on stage</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;ve been yeah it&rsquo;s been really fun</p>
<p>especially because it&rsquo;s been such a dark horrible</p>
<p>year and a half this past year and a half</p>
<p>fuck is you know it&rsquo;s amazing you saying that because</p>
<p>it was dark and horrible when i knew you in ninety four</p>
<p>and this is</p>
<p>yeah and that</p>
<p>was nothing like this last year and a half has been the</p>
<p>worst year and a half of my life</p>
<p>fuck like really i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s you know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not exactly</p>
<p>gonna say i</p>
<p>if i hadn&rsquo;t gotten through it i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have been surprised you know</p>
<p>wow you know</p>
<p>it was that so you thought</p>
<p>about oh yeah suicide</p>
<p>oh tons tons times</p>
<p>fuck most of the time</p>
<p>you know well you have my number now yeah</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do that oh no i wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>why couldn&rsquo;t do it you know the main</p>
<p>thing was and it wasn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>like not like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna prevent</p>
<p>your suicide</p>
<p>what a ridiculous</p>
<p>you have my number now we</p>
<p>have no more concerns yeah</p>

<p>eight soon right</p>

<p>thing i&rsquo;ve gone</p>
<p>hurt her so badly oh god</p>
<p>you know and that was that was the only</p>
<p>thing you know my</p>
<p>teenagers i figured they really</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t care too much</p>
<p>you know do you</p>
<p>do you exercise at all</p>
<p>huh do you exercise obviously not well</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna start</p>
<p>yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>well actually</p>
<p>cause i just</p>
<p>you know now i&rsquo;m actually feeling pretty good</p>
<p>stand up is making me feel better</p>
<p>sure like so</p>
<p>so huge rush</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>great just being on</p>
<p>stage and being</p>
<p>funny remembering</p>
<p>the reason i</p>
<p>started doing this the reason that i like doing it is</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s fun</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fun and it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re creating positive energy and</p>
<p>a positive environment you&rsquo;re giving someone something</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re changing their</p>
<p>state yes and i just booked a</p>
<p>pilot which</p>
<p>is nice nice with a show called how to be a gentleman</p>
<p>nice which is</p>
<p>a good script and</p>
<p>funny and so obviously</p>
<p>the secret does work</p>
<p>i put out some positive energy</p>
<p>and now i gotta show well</p>
<p>maintaining your body is so important your body can</p>
<p>trick you and</p>
<p>your body can</p>
<p>betray you whenever there&rsquo;s times of stress</p>
<p>all those chemicals</p>
<p>they think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to</p>
<p>fight off a cheetah or something</p>
<p>you know what i mean</p>
<p>your chemicals</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t realize that oh you&rsquo;re just dealing with a</p>
<p>legal entanglement so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like and i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>spent most of my life</p>
<p>going okay buddy can you take this you know</p>
<p>if i neglect you and</p>
<p>abuse you this way yeah right</p>
<p>so what do you plan</p>
<p>on doing like yoga or something like that what do you</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the idea for working out</p>
<p>just getting on</p>
<p>getting on an exercise like</p>
<p>i actually joined the gym i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t been</p>
<p>you know but i actually have joined like you know</p>
<p>a gym downtown</p>
<p>iphones make</p>
<p>it so fucking fascinating it makes it so much better</p>
<p>put on a podcast and</p>
<p>know a lot of people listen to this podcast</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>people ironically at the gym struggling through it</p>
<p>right now listening to you</p>
<p>on their iphone i know there are then i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry about the middle part of this conversation</p>
<p>that helps to</p>
<p>pump harder</p>
<p>i get probably</p>
<p>listen man other people&rsquo;s trauma</p>
<p>and struggles it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>beneficial you can</p>
<p>learn from that</p>
<p>yeah you can</p>
<p>learn a lot of</p>
<p>stuff just drink a lot like i did</p>
<p>and hide it</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t go through</p>
<p>nothing man</p>
<p>you have a couple fucking cats and a dog you have no</p>
<p>entanglements you have no worries</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a single mom what are you talking</p>
<p>about i have to fucking take my</p>
<p>last night i got</p>
<p>pretty drunk and i</p>
<p>had to wake up at 8 am to let my dog out and sit</p>
<p>there with the</p>
<p>worst hangar i felt like puking</p>
<p>and go back to bed</p>
<p>for a while</p>
<p>baby this motherfucker took malaria</p>
<p>medication and went to morocco no</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m saying i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m a full time single mom man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>annoying that&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>little baby</p>
<p>and you need</p>
<p>to join the marines</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a baby and you need to join the fucking marines</p>
<p>right you need to</p>
<p>learn some discipline</p>
<p>yeah i got up at 8 am and i had</p>
<p>to open the</p>
<p>doors my dog can pee</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s set up there anyone</p>
<p>anyone yeah</p>
<p>no having pets</p>
<p>it really is nothing like having children yeah it is</p>
<p>absolutely nothing like i leave my</p>
<p>dogs outside all the time i don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t leave that</p>
<p>kid anywhere</p>
<p>no that&rsquo;s the thing you</p>
<p>learn when you do have kids is like you know</p>
<p>you really realize oh my pets</p>
<p>i love them</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re disposable they can die</p>
<p>they can die now and</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ll feel bad for a day</p>
<p>you know for that you know</p>
<p>at least it wasn&rsquo;t me</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>at least it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>me or my family yeah but it&rsquo;s amazing when i see women</p>
<p>just suppressing</p>
<p>that maternal instinct with children but they have a</p>
<p>bunch of fucking cats or dogs or something</p>
<p>like that yeah they</p>
<p>are my children no they aren&rsquo;t your children they don&rsquo;t</p>
