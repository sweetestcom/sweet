    <p>The following is a conversation with Michael I. Jordan, a professor at Berkeley and one</p>
<p>of the most influential people in the history of machine learning, statistics, and artificial</p>
<p>intelligence.</p>
<p>He has been cited over 170,000 times and he has mentored many of the world class researchers</p>
<p>defining the field of AI today, including Andrew Ng, Zubin Garamani, Ben Taskar, and</p>
<p>Yoshua Bengio.</p>
<p>All this, to me, is as impressive as the over 32,000 points in the six NBA championships</p>
<p>of the Michael J. Jordan of basketball fame.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a nonzero probability that I talked to the other Michael Jordan given my connection</p>
<p>to and love of the Chicago Bulls of the 90s, but if I had to pick one, I&rsquo;m going with</p>
<p>the Michael Jordan of statistics and computer science, or as Yann LeCun calls him, the Miles</p>
<p>Davis of machine learning.</p>
<p>In his blog post titled Artificial Intelligence, the Revolution Hasn&rsquo;t Happened Yet, Michael</p>
<p>argues for broadening the scope of the artificial intelligence field.</p>
<p>In many ways, the underlying spirit of this podcast is the same, to see artificial intelligence</p>
<p>as a deeply human endeavor, to not only engineer algorithms and robots, but to understand and</p>
<p>empower human beings at all levels of abstraction, from the individual to our civilization as</p>
<p>a whole.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it, subscribe and YouTube, give it five stars at Apple Podcast, support it</p>
<p>on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman spelled F R I D M A N.</p>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;ll do one or two minutes of ads now and never any ads in the middle that</p>
<p>can break the flow of the conversation.</p>
<p>I hope that works for you and doesn&rsquo;t hurt the listening experience.</p>
<p>This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store.</p>
<p>When you get it, use code LEX PODCAST.</p>
<p>Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with</p>
<p>as little as $1.</p>
<p>Since Cash App does fractional share trading, let me mention that the order execution algorithm</p>
<p>that worked behind the scenes to create the abstraction of the fractional orders is to</p>
<p>me an algorithmic marvel.</p>
<p>Great props for the Cash App engineers for solving a hard problem that in the end provides</p>
<p>an easy interface that takes a step up to the next layer of abstraction over the stock</p>
<p>market, making trading more accessible for new investors and diversification much easier.</p>
<p>So once again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play and use the code</p>
<p>LEX PODCAST, you&rsquo;ll get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to First, one of my favorite</p>
<p>organizations that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education for young people around</p>
<p>the world.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Michael I. Jordan.</p>
<p>Given that you&rsquo;re one of the greats in the field of AI, machine learning, computer science,</p>
<p>and so on, you&rsquo;re trivially called the Michael Jordan of machine learning, although as you</p>
<p>know, you were born first, so technically MJ is the Michael I. Jordan of basketball.</p>
<p>But anyway, my favorite is Yann LeCun calling you the Miles Davis of machine learning because</p>
<p>as he says, you reinvent yourself periodically and sometimes leave fans scratching their</p>
<p>heads after you change direction.</p>
<p>So can you put at first your historian hat on and give a history of computer science</p>
<p>and AI as you saw it, as you experienced it, including the four generations of AI successes</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve seen you talk about?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, first of all, I much prefer Yann&rsquo;s metaphor.</p>
<p>Miles Davis was a real explorer in jazz and he had a coherent story.</p>
<p>So I think I have one, but it&rsquo;s not just the one you lived, it&rsquo;s the one you think about</p>
<p>later.</p>
<p>What the historian does is they look back and they revisit.</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s happening right now is not AI, that was an intellectual aspiration that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still alive today as an aspiration.</p>
<p>But I think this is akin to the development of chemical engineering from chemistry or</p>
<p>electrical engineering from electromagnetism.</p>
<p>So if you go back to the 30s or 40s, there wasn&rsquo;t yet chemical engineering.</p>
<p>There was chemistry, there was fluid flow, there was mechanics and so on.</p>
<p>But people pretty clearly viewed interesting goals to try to build factories that make</p>
<p>chemicals products and do it viably, safely, make good ones, do it at scale.</p>
<p>So people started to try to do that, of course, and some factories worked, some didn&rsquo;t, some</p>
<p>were not viable, some exploded, but in parallel, developed a whole field called chemical engineering.</p>
<p>Electrical engineering is a field, it&rsquo;s no bones about it, it has theoretical aspects</p>
<p>to it, it has practical aspects.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just engineering, quote unquote, it&rsquo;s the real thing, real concepts are needed.</p>
<p>Same thing with electrical engineering.</p>
<p>There was Maxwell&rsquo;s equations, which in some sense were everything you know about electromagnetism,</p>
<p>but you needed to figure out how to build circuits, how to build modules, how to put</p>
<p>them together, how to bring electricity from one point to another safely and so on and</p>
<p>so forth.</p>
<p>So a whole field that developed called electrical engineering.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening right now, is that we have a proto field, which is statistics,</p>
<p>more of the theoretical side of it, algorithmic side of computer science, that was enough</p>
<p>to start to build things, but what things?</p>
<p>Systems that bring value to human beings and use human data and mix in human decisions.</p>
<p>The engineering side of that is all ad hoc.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s emerging.</p>
<p>In fact, if you wanna call machine learning a field, I think that&rsquo;s what it is, that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a proto form of engineering based on statistical and computational ideas of previous generations.</p>
<p>But do you think there&rsquo;s something deeper about AI in his dreams and aspirations as</p>
<p>compared to chemical engineering and electrical engineering?</p>
<p>Well the dreams and aspirations maybe, but those are 500 years from now.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s like the Greeks sitting there and saying, it would be neat to get</p>
<p>to the moon someday.</p>
<p>I think we have no clue how the brain does computation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just a clueless.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re even worse than the Greeks on most anything interesting scientifically of our era.</p>
<p>Can you linger on that just for a moment because you stand not completely unique, but a little</p>
<p>bit unique in the clarity of that.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate your intuition of why we&rsquo;re, like where we stand in our understanding of</p>
<p>the human brain?</p>
<p>And a lot of people say, you know, scientists say we&rsquo;re not very far in understanding human</p>
<p>brain, but you&rsquo;re like, you&rsquo;re saying we&rsquo;re in the dark here.</p>
<p>Well, I know I&rsquo;m not unique.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even think in the clarity, but if you talk to real neuroscientists that really</p>
<p>study real synapses or real neurons, they agree, they agree.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hundreds of year task and they&rsquo;re building it up slowly and surely.</p>
<p>What the signal is there is not clear.</p>
<p>We think we have all of our metaphors.</p>
<p>We think it&rsquo;s electrical, maybe it&rsquo;s chemical, it&rsquo;s a whole soup, it&rsquo;s ions and proteins</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a cell.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s even around like a single synapse.</p>
<p>If you look at a electron micrograph of a single synapse, it&rsquo;s a city of its own.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one little thing on a dendritic tree, which is extremely complicated electrochemical</p>
<p>thing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s doing these spikes and voltages are flying around and then proteins are taking</p>
<p>that and taking it down into the DNA and who knows what.</p>
<p>So it is the problem of the next few centuries.</p>
<p>It is fantastic.</p>
<p>But we have our metaphors about it.</p>
<p>Is it an economic device?</p>
<p>Is it like the immune system or is it like a layered set of, you know, arithmetic computations?</p>
<p>We have all these metaphors and they&rsquo;re fun.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not real science per se.</p>
<p>There is neuroscience.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not neuroscience.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the Greek speculating about how to get to the moon, fun, right?</p>
<p>And I think that I like to say this fairly strongly because I think a lot of young people</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;re on the verge because a lot of people who don&rsquo;t talk about it clearly let</p>
<p>it be understood that, yes, we kind of, this is a brain inspired, we&rsquo;re kind of close,</p>
<p>you know, breakthroughs are on the horizon.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s scrupulous people sometimes who need money for their labs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying, scrupulous, but people will oversell, I need money for my lab, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>studying computational neuroscience, I&rsquo;m going to oversell it.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s been too much of that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll step into the gray area between metaphor and engineering with, I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>familiar with brain computer interfaces.</p>
<p>So a company like Elon Musk has Neuralink that&rsquo;s working on putting electrodes into</p>
<p>the brain and trying to be able to read, both read and send electrical signals.</p>
<p>Just as you said, even the basic mechanism of communication in the brain is not something</p>
<p>we understand.</p>
<p>But do you hope without understanding the fundamental principles of how the brain works,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be able to do something interesting at that gray area of metaphor?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not my area.</p>
<p>So I hope in the sense, like anybody else hopes for some interesting things to happen</p>
<p>from research, I would expect more something like Alzheimer&rsquo;s will get figured out from</p>
<p>modern neuroscience.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of human suffering based on brain disease and we throw things like lithium</p>
<p>at the brain, it kind of works, no one has a clue why.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not quite true, but mostly we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s even just about the biochemistry of the brain and how it leads to mood swings</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>How thought emerges from that, we were really, really completely dim.</p>
<p>So that you might want to hook up electrodes and try to do some signal processing on that</p>
<p>and try to find patterns, fine, by all means, go for it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not scientific at this point.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like kind of sitting in a satellite and watching the emissions from a city and</p>
<p>trying to infer things about the microeconomy, even though you don&rsquo;t have microeconomic concepts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really that kind of thing.</p>
<p>And so yes, can you find some signals that do something interesting or useful?</p>
<p>Can you control a cursor or mouse with your brain?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely, and then I can imagine business models based on that and even medical applications</p>
<p>of that.</p>
<p>But from there to understanding algorithms that allow us to really tie in deeply from</p>
<p>the brain to computer, I just, no, I don&rsquo;t agree with Elon Musk.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s even, that&rsquo;s not for our generations, not even for the century.</p>
<p>So just in hopes of getting you to dream, you&rsquo;ve mentioned Kolmogorov and Turing might</p>
<p>pop up, do you think that there might be breakthroughs that will get you to sit back in five, 10</p>
<p>years and say, wow?</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m sure there will be, but I don&rsquo;t think that there&rsquo;ll be demos that impress me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that having a computer call a restaurant and pretend to be a human is</p>
<p>a breakthrough.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And people, you know, some people present it as such.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s imitating human intelligence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even putting coughs in the thing to make a bit of a PR stunt.</p>
<p>And so fine that the world runs on those things too.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to diminish all the hard work and engineering that goes behind things</p>
<p>like that and the ultimate value to the human race.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not scientific understanding.</p>
<p>And I know the people that work on these things, they are after scientific understanding.</p>
<p>In the meantime, they&rsquo;ve got to kind of, you know, the trains got to run and they got mouths</p>
<p>to feed and they got things to do and there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with all that.</p>
<p>I would call that though, just engineering.</p>
<p>And I want to distinguish that between an engineering field, like electrical engineering</p>
<p>and chemical engineering that originally emerged, that had real principles and you really know</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing and you had a little scientific understanding, maybe not even complete.</p>
<p>So it became more predictable and it really gave value to human life because it was understood.</p>
<p>And so we don&rsquo;t want to muddle too much these waters of, you know, what we&rsquo;re able to do</p>
<p>versus what we really can&rsquo;t do in a way that&rsquo;s going to impress the next.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t need to be wowed, but I think that someone comes along in 20 years, a younger</p>
<p>person who&rsquo;s absorbed all the technology and for them to be wowed, I think they have to</p>
<p>be more deeply impressed.</p>
<p>A young Kolmogorov would not be wowed by some of the stunts that you see right now coming</p>
<p>from the big companies.</p>
<p>The demos, but do you think the breakthroughs from Kolmogorov would be, and give this question</p>
<p>a chance, do you think there&rsquo;ll be in the scientific fundamental principles arena or</p>
<p>do you think it&rsquo;s possible to have fundamental breakthroughs in engineering?</p>
<p>Meaning, you know, I would say some of the things that Elon Musk is working with SpaceX</p>
<p>and then others sort of trying to revolutionize the fundamentals of engineering, of manufacturing,</p>
<p>of saying, here&rsquo;s a problem we know how to do a demo of and actually taking it to scale.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s going to be all kinds of breakthroughs.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t like that terminology.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a scientist and I work on things day in and day out and things move along and eventually</p>
<p>you say, wow, something happened, but I don&rsquo;t like that language very much.</p>
<p>Also I don&rsquo;t like to prize theoretical breakthroughs over practical ones.</p>
<p>I tend to be more of a theoretician and I think there&rsquo;s lots to do in that arena right</p>
<p>now.</p>
<p>And so I wouldn&rsquo;t point to the Kolmogorovs, I might point to the Edisons of the era and</p>
<p>maybe Musk is a bit more like that.</p>
<p>But you know, Musk, God bless him, also will say things about AI that he knows very little</p>
<p>about and he leads people astray when he talks about things he doesn&rsquo;t know anything about.</p>
<p>Trying to program a computer to understand natural language, to be involved in a dialogue</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re having right now, that ain&rsquo;t going to happen in our lifetime.</p>
<p>You could fake it, you can mimic, sort of take old sentences that humans use and retread</p>
<p>them, but the deep understanding of language, no, it&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p>
<p>And so from that, I hope you can perceive that the deeper, yet deeper kind of aspects</p>
<p>and intelligence are not going to happen.</p>
<p>Now will there be breakthroughs?</p>
<p>No, I think that Google was a breakthrough, I think Amazon is a breakthrough, you know,</p>
<p>I think Uber is a breakthrough, you know, that bring value to human beings at scale</p>
<p>in new, brand new ways based on data flows and so on.</p>
<p>A lot of these things are slightly broken because there&rsquo;s not kind of an engineering</p>
<p>field that takes economic value in context of data and, you know, planetary scale and</p>
<p>worries about all the externalities, the privacy, you know, we don&rsquo;t have that field so we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think these things through very well.</p>
<p>I see that as emerging and that will be, you know, looking back from 100 years, that will</p>
<p>be a constituted breakthrough in this era, just like electrical engineering was a breakthrough</p>
<p>in the early part of the last century and chemical engineering was a breakthrough.</p>
<p>So the scale, the markets that you talk about and we&rsquo;ll get to will be seen as sort of breakthrough</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re in the very early days of really doing interesting stuff there and we&rsquo;ll get</p>
<p>to that, but just taking a quick step back, can you give, kind of throw off the historian</p>
<p>hat.</p>
<p>I mean, you briefly said that the history of AI kind of mimics the history of chemical</p>
<p>engineering, but&hellip;</p>
<p>I keep saying machine learning.</p>
<p>You keep wanting to say AI, just to let you know, I don&rsquo;t, you know, I resist that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is about AI really was John McCarthy as almost a philosopher saying,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool if we could put thought in a computer?</p>
<p>If we could mimic the human capability to think or put intelligence in, in some sense</p>
<p>into a computer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting philosophical question and he wanted to make it more than philosophy.</p>
<p>He wanted to actually write down a logical formula and algorithms that would do that.</p>
<p>And that is a perfectly valid, reasonable thing to do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s happening in this era.</p>
<p>So the reason I keep saying AI actually, and I&rsquo;d love to hear what you think about it.</p>
<p>Machine learning has a very particular set of methods and tools.</p>
<p>Maybe your version of it is that mine doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s very, very open.</p>
<p>It does optimization, it does sampling, it does&hellip;</p>
<p>So systems that learn is what machine learning is.</p>
<p>Systems that learn and make decisions.</p>
<p>And make decisions.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just pattern recognition and, you know, finding patterns, it&rsquo;s all about</p>
<p>making decisions in real worlds and having close feedback loops.</p>
<p>So something like symbolic AI, expert systems, reasoning systems, knowledge based representation,</p>
<p>all of those kinds of things, search, does that neighbor fit into what you think of as</p>
<p>machine learning?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t even like the word machine learning, I think that what the field you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about is all about making large collections of decisions under uncertainty by large collections</p>
<p>of entities.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And there are principles for that, at that scale.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to say the principles are for a single entity that&rsquo;s making decisions, single</p>
<p>agent or single human.</p>
<p>It really immediately goes to the network of decisions.</p>
<p>Is a good word for that or no?</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s no good words for any of this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of part of the problem.</p>
<p>So we can continue the conversation to use AI for all that.</p>
<p>I just want to kind of raise the flag here that this is not about, we don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>intelligence is and real intelligence.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know much about abstraction and reasoning at the level of humans.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a clue.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not trying to build that because we don&rsquo;t have a clue.</p>
<p>Eventually it may emerge.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll make, I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;ll be breakthroughs, but eventually we&rsquo;ll start</p>
<p>to get glimmers of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s happening right now.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re taking data.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to make good decisions based on that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to scale.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to economically viably, we&rsquo;re trying to build markets.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to keep value at that scale and aspects of this will look intelligent.</p>
<p>Computers were so dumb before, they will seem more intelligent.</p>
<p>We will use that buzzword of intelligence so we can use it in that sense.</p>
<p>So machine learning, you can scope it narrowly as just learning from data and pattern recognition.</p>
<p>But when I talk about these topics, maybe data science is another word you could throw</p>
<p>in the mix, it really is important that the decisions are as part of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s consequential decisions in the real world.</p>
<p>Am I going to have a medical operation?</p>
<p>Am I going to drive down the street?</p>
<p>Things where there&rsquo;s scarcity, things that impact other human beings or other environments</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>How do I do that based on data?</p>
<p>How do I do that adaptively?</p>
<p>How do I use computers to help those kinds of things go forward?</p>
<p>Whatever you want to call that.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s call it AI.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s agree to call it AI, but let&rsquo;s not say that the goal of that is intelligence.</p>
<p>The goal of that is really good working systems at planetary scale that we&rsquo;ve never seen before.</p>
<p>So reclaim the word AI from the Dartmouth conference from many decades ago of the dream</p>
<p>of humans.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to reclaim it.</p>
<p>I want a new word.</p>
<p>I think it was a bad choice.</p>
<p>I mean, if you read one of my little things, the history was basically that McCarthy needed</p>
<p>a new name because cybernetics already existed and he didn&rsquo;t like, no one really liked Norbert</p>
<p>Wiener.</p>
<p>Norbert Wiener was kind of an island to himself and he felt that he had encompassed all this</p>
<p>and in some sense he did.</p>
<p>You look at the language of cybernetics, it was everything we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>It was control theory and signal processing and some notions of intelligence and closed</p>
<p>feedback loops and data.</p>
<p>It was all there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not a word that lived on partly because of the maybe the personalities.</p>
<p>But McCarthy needed a new word to say, I&rsquo;m different from you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not part of your show.</p>
<p>I got my own.</p>
<p>Invented this word and again, thinking forward about the movies that would be made about</p>
<p>it, it was a great choice.</p>
<p>But thinking forward about creating a sober academic and real world discipline, it was</p>
<p>a terrible choice because it led to promises that are not true that we understand.</p>
<p>We understand artificial perhaps, but we don&rsquo;t understand intelligence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a small tangent because you&rsquo;re one of the great personalities of machine learning,</p>
<p>whatever the heck you call the field.</p>
<p>Do you think science progresses by personalities or by the fundamental principles and theories</p>
<p>and research that&rsquo;s outside of personalities?</p>
<p>Both.</p>
<p>And I wouldn&rsquo;t say there should be one kind of personality.</p>
<p>I have mine and I have my preferences and I have a kind of network around me that feeds</p>
<p>me and some of them agree with me and some of them disagree, but all kinds of personalities</p>
<p>are needed.</p>
<p>Right now, I think the personality that it&rsquo;s a little too exuberant, a little bit too ready</p>
<p>to promise the moon is a little bit too much in ascendance.</p>
<p>And I do think that there&rsquo;s some good to that.</p>
<p>It certainly attracts lots of young people to our field, but a lot of those people come</p>
<p>in with strong misconceptions and they have to then unlearn those and then find something</p>
<p>to do.</p>
<p>And so I think there&rsquo;s just got to be some multiple voices and I wasn&rsquo;t hearing enough</p>
<p>of the more sober voice.</p>
<p>So as a continuation of a fun tangent and speaking of vibrant personalities, what would</p>
<p>you say is the most interesting disagreement you have with Jan Lacune?</p>
<p>So Jan&rsquo;s an old friend and I just say that I don&rsquo;t think we disagree about very much</p>
<p>really.</p>
<p>He and I both kind of have a let&rsquo;s build it kind of mentality and does it work kind of</p>
<p>mentality and kind of concrete.</p>
<p>We both speak French and we speak French more together and we have a lot in common.</p>
<p>And so if one wanted to highlight a disagreement, it&rsquo;s not really a fundamental one.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just kind of what we&rsquo;re emphasizing.</p>
<p>Jan has emphasized pattern recognition and has emphasized prediction.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting to try to take that as far as you can.</p>
<p>If you could do perfect prediction, what would that give you kind of as a thought experiment?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s way too limited.</p>
<p>We cannot do perfect prediction.</p>
<p>We will never have the data sets that allow me to figure out what you&rsquo;re about ready to</p>
<p>do, what question you&rsquo;re going to ask next.</p>
<p>I have no clue.</p>
<p>I will never know such things.</p>
<p>Moreover, most of us find ourselves during the day in all kinds of situations we had</p>
<p>no anticipation of that are kind of very, very novel in various ways.</p>
<p>And in that moment, we want to think through what we want.</p>
<p>And also there&rsquo;s going to be market forces acting on us.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to go down that street, but now it&rsquo;s full because there&rsquo;s a crane in the street.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>I got to think about that.</p>
<p>I got to think about what I might really want here.</p>
<p>And I got to sort of think about how much it costs me to do this action versus this</p>
<p>action.</p>
<p>I got to think about the risks involved.</p>
<p>A lot of our current pattern recognition and prediction systems don&rsquo;t do any risk evaluations.</p>
<p>They have no error bars, right?</p>
<p>I got to think about other people&rsquo;s decisions around me.</p>
<p>I got to think about a collection of my decisions, even just thinking about like a medical treatment,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m not going to take a, the prediction of a neural net about my health, about something</p>
<p>consequential.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not about ready to have a heart attack because some number is over 0.7.</p>
<p>Even if you had all the data in the world that ever been collected about heart attacks</p>
<p>better than any doctor ever had, I&rsquo;m not going to trust the output of that neural net to</p>
<p>predict my heart attack.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to want to ask what if questions around that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to want to look at some us or other possible data I didn&rsquo;t have, causal things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to want to have a dialogue with a doctor about things we didn&rsquo;t think about</p>
<p>when he gathered the data.</p>
<p>You know, I could go on and on.</p>
<p>I hope you can see.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t, I think that if you say predictions, everything that, that, that you&rsquo;re missing</p>
<p>all of this stuff.</p>
<p>And so prediction plus decision making is everything, but both of them are equally important.</p>
<p>And so the field has emphasized prediction, Jan rightly so has seen how powerful that</p>
<p>is.</p>
<p>But at the cost of people not being aware that decision making is where the rubber really</p>
<p>hits the road, where human lives are at stake, where risks are being taken, where you got</p>
<p>to gather more data.</p>
<p>You got to think about the error bars.</p>
<p>You got to think about the consequences of your decisions on others.</p>
<p>You got to think about the economy around your decisions, blah, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the only one working on those, but we&rsquo;re a smaller tribe.</p>
<p>And right now we&rsquo;re not the one that people talk about the most.</p>
<p>But you know, if you go out in the real world and industry, you know, at Amazon, I&rsquo;d say</p>
<p>half the people there are working on decision making and the other half are doing, you know,</p>
<p>the pattern recognition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>And the words of pattern recognition and prediction, I think the distinction there, not to linger</p>
<p>on words, but the distinction there is more a constrained sort of in the lab data set</p>
<p>versus decision making is talking about consequential decisions in the real world, under the messiness</p>
<p>and the uncertainty of the real world.</p>
<p>And just the whole of it, the whole mess of it that actually touches human beings and</p>
<p>scale.</p>
<p>And the forces, that&rsquo;s the distinction.</p>
<p>It helps add those, that perspective, that broader perspective.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I totally agree.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you&rsquo;re a real prediction person, of course, you want it to be in the</p>
<p>real world.</p>
<p>You want to predict real world events.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying that&rsquo;s not possible with just data sets.</p>
<p>That it has to be in the context of, you know, strategic things that someone&rsquo;s doing, data</p>
<p>they might gather, things they could have gathered, the reasoning process around data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just taking data and making predictions based on the data.</p>
<p>So one of the things that you&rsquo;re working on, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s others working on it, but</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hear often it talked about, especially in the clarity that you talk about it, and</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s both the most exciting and the most concerning area of AI in terms of decision</p>
<p>making.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve talked about AI systems that help make decisions that scale in a distributed</p>
<p>way, millions, billions decisions, sort of markets of decisions.</p>
<p>Can you, as a starting point, sort of give an example of a system that you think about</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re thinking about these kinds of systems?</p>
<p>Yeah, so first of all, you&rsquo;re absolutely getting into some territory, which I will be beyond</p>
<p>my expertise.</p>
<p>And there are lots of things that are going to be very not obvious to think about.</p>
<p>Just like, again, I like to think about history a little bit, but think about put yourself</p>
<p>back in the sixties.</p>
<p>There was kind of a banking system that wasn&rsquo;t computerized really.</p>
<p>There was database theory emerging and database people had to think about how do I actually</p>
<p>not just move data around, but actual money and have it be, you know, valid and have transactions</p>
<p>that ATMs happen that are actually, you know, all valid and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the kind of issues you get into when you start to get serious about sorts</p>
<p>of things like this.</p>
<p>I like to think about as kind of almost a thought experiment to help me think something</p>
<p>simpler, which is the music market.</p>
<p>And because there is, to first order, there is no music market in the world right now</p>
<p>and in our country, for sure.</p>
<p>There are something called things called record companies and they make money and they prop</p>
<p>up a few really good musicians and make them superstars and they all make huge amounts</p>
<p>of money.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a long tail of huge numbers of people that make lots and lots of really good</p>
<p>music that is actually listened to by more people than the famous people.</p>
<p>They are not in a market.</p>
<p>They cannot have a career.</p>
<p>They do not make money.</p>
<p>The creators, the creators, the creators, the so called influencers or whatever that</p>
<p>diminishes who they are.</p>
<p>So there are people who make extremely good music, especially in the hip hop or Latin</p>
<p>world these days.</p>
<p>They do it on their laptop.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they do on the weekend and they have another job during the week and they</p>
<p>put it up on SoundCloud or other sites.</p>
<p>Eventually it gets streamed.</p>
<p>It now gets turned into bits.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not economically valuable.</p>
<p>The information is lost.</p>
<p>It gets put up there.</p>
<p>People stream it.</p>
<p>You walk around in a big city, you see people with headphones, especially young kids listening</p>
<p>to music all the time.</p>
<p>If you look at the data, very little of the music they are listening to is the famous</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s music and none of it&rsquo;s old music.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all the latest stuff.</p>
<p>But the people who made that latest stuff are like some 16 year old somewhere who will</p>
<p>never make a career out of this, who will never make money.</p>
<p>Of course there will be a few counter examples.</p>
<p>The record companies incentivize to pick out a few and highlight them.</p>
<p>Long story short, there&rsquo;s a missing market there.</p>
<p>There is not a consumer producer relationship at the level of the actual creative acts.</p>
<p>The pipelines and Spotify&rsquo;s of the world that take this stuff and stream it along, they</p>
<p>make money off of subscriptions or advertising and those things.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re making the money.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>And then they will offer bits and pieces of it to a few people again to highlight that</p>
<p>they simulate a market.</p>
<p>Anyway, a real market would be if you&rsquo;re a creator of music that you actually are somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s good enough that people want to listen to you, you should have the data available</p>
<p>to you.</p>
<p>There should be a dashboard showing a map of the United States.</p>
<p>So in last week, here&rsquo;s all the places your songs were listened to.</p>
<p>It should be transparent, vetable, so that if someone down in Providence sees that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>being listened to 10,000 times in Providence, that they know that&rsquo;s real data.</p>
<p>You know it&rsquo;s real data.</p>
<p>They will have you come give a show down there.</p>
<p>They will broadcast to the people who&rsquo;ve been listening to you that you&rsquo;re coming.</p>
<p>If you do this right, you could go down there and make $20,000.</p>
<p>You do that three times a year, you start to have a career.</p>
<p>So in this sense, AI creates jobs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about taking away human jobs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s creating new jobs because it creates a new market.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve created a market, you&rsquo;ve now connected up producers and consumers.</p>
<p>The person who&rsquo;s making the music can say to someone who comes to their shows a lot,</p>
<p>hey, I&rsquo;ll play at your daughter&rsquo;s wedding for $10,000.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll say 8,000.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll say 9,000.</p>
<p>Then again, you can now get an income up to $100,000.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to be a millionaire.</p>
<p>And now even think about really the value of music is in these personal connections,</p>
<p>even so much so that a young kid wants to wear a tshirt with their favorite musician&rsquo;s</p>
<p>signature on it.</p>
<p>So if they listen to the music on the internet, the internet should be able to provide them</p>
<p>with a button that they push and the merchandise arrives the next day.</p>
<p>We can do that.</p>
<p>And now why should we do that?</p>
<p>Well, because the kid who bought the shirt will be happy, but more the person who made</p>
<p>the music will get the money.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no advertising needed.</p>
<p>So you can create markets between producers and consumers, take 5% cut.</p>
<p>Your company will be perfectly sound.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll go forward into the future and it will create new markets and that raises human happiness.</p>
<p>Now this seems like, well, this is easy, just create this dashboard, kind of create some</p>
<p>connections and all that.</p>
<p>But if you think about Uber or whatever, you think about the challenges in the real world</p>
<p>of doing things like this, and there are actually new principles going to be needed.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to create a new kind of two way market at a different scale that&rsquo;s ever</p>
<p>been done before.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be unwanted aspects of the market.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be bad people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be the data will get used in the wrong ways, it&rsquo;ll fail in some ways, it won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>deliver about.</p>
<p>You have to think that through.</p>
<p>Just like anyone who ran a big auction or ran a big matching service in economics will</p>
<p>think these things through.</p>
<p>And so that maybe doesn&rsquo;t get at all the huge issues that can arise when you start to create</p>
<p>markets, but it starts to, at least for me, solidify my thoughts and allow me to move</p>
<p>forward in my own thinking.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I talked to the head of research at Spotify actually, and I think their longterm goal,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve said, is to have at least one million creators make a comfortable living putting</p>
<p>on Spotify.</p>
<p>So I think you articulate a really nice vision of the world and the digital and the cyberspace</p>
<p>of markets.</p>
<p>What do you think companies like Spotify or YouTube or Netflix can do to create such markets?</p>
<p>Is it an AI problem?</p>
<p>Is it an interface problem for interface design?</p>
<p>Is it some other kind of, is it an economics problem?</p>
<p>Who should they hire to solve these problems?</p>
<p>Well, part of it&rsquo;s not just top down.</p>
<p>So the Silicon Valley has this attitude that they know how to do it.</p>
<p>They will create the system just like Google did with the search box that will be so good</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ll just, everyone will adopt that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s everything you said, but really I think missing that kind of culture.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s literally that 16 year old who&rsquo;s able to create the songs.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t create that as a Silicon Valley entity.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t hire them per se.</p>
<p>You have to create an ecosystem in which they are wanted and that they belong.</p>
<p>And so you have to have some cultural credibility to do things like this.</p>
<p>Netflix, to their credit, wanted some of that credibility and they created shows, content.</p>
<p>They call it content.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a terrible word, but it&rsquo;s culture.</p>
<p>And so with movies, you can kind of go give a large sum of money to somebody graduating</p>
<p>from the USC film school.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a whole thing of its own, but it&rsquo;s kind of like rich white people&rsquo;s thing to do.</p>
<p>And American culture has not been so much about rich white people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been about all the immigrants, all the Africans who came and brought that culture</p>
<p>and those rhythms to this world and created this whole new thing.</p>
<p>American culture.</p>
<p>And so companies can&rsquo;t artificially create that.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t just say, hey, we&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to buy it up.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got a partner.</p>
<p>And so anyway, not to denigrate, these companies are all trying and they should, and I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re asking these questions and some of them are even making an effort.</p>
<p>But it is partly a respect the culture as a technology person.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to blend your technology with cultural meaning.</p>
<p>How much of a role do you think the algorithm, so machine learning has in connecting the</p>
<p>consumer to the creator, sort of the recommender system aspect of this?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>I think pretty high.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no magic in the algorithms, but a good recommender system is way better than</p>
<p>a bad recommender system.</p>
<p>And recommender systems is a billion dollar industry back even 10, 20 years ago.</p>
<p>And it continues to be extremely important going forward.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your favorite recommender system, just so we can put something, well, just historically</p>
<p>I was one of the, when I first went to Amazon, I first didn&rsquo;t like Amazon because they put</p>
<p>the book people out of business or the library, the local booksellers went out of business.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come to accept that there probably are more books being sold now and poor people</p>
<p>reading them than ever before.</p>
<p>And then local book stores are coming back.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how economics sometimes work.</p>
<p>You go up and you go down.</p>
<p>But anyway, when I finally started going there and I bought a few books, I was really pleased</p>
<p>to see another few books being recommended to me that I never would have thought of.</p>
<p>And I bought a bunch of them.</p>
<p>So they obviously had a good business model.</p>
<p>But I learned things and I still to this day kind of browse using that service.</p>
<p>And I think lots of people get a lot, that is a good aspect of a recommendation system.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m learning from my peers in an indirect way.</p>
<p>And their algorithms are not meant to have them impose what we learn.</p>
<p>It really is trying to find out what&rsquo;s in the data.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t work so well for other kinds of entities, but that&rsquo;s just the complexity of</p>
<p>human life.</p>
<p>Like shirts, I&rsquo;m not going to get recommendations on shirts, but that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>If you try to recommend restaurants, it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to do it at scale.</p>
<p>But a blend of recommendation systems with other economic ideas, matchings and so on</p>
<p>is really, really still very open research wise.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s new companies that are going to emerge that do that well.</p>
<p>What do you think is going to the messy, difficult land of say politics and things like that,</p>
<p>that YouTube and Twitter have to deal with in terms of recommendation systems?</p>
<p>Being able to suggest, I think Facebook just launched Facebook news.</p>
<p>So recommend the kind of news that are most likely for you to be interesting.</p>
<p>Do you think this is AI solvable, again, whatever term we want to use, do you think it&rsquo;s a solvable</p>
<p>problem for machines or is it a deeply human problem that&rsquo;s unsolvable?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t even think about it at that level.</p>
<p>I think that what&rsquo;s broken with some of these companies, it&rsquo;s all monetization by advertising.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not, at least Facebook, I want to critique them, but they didn&rsquo;t really try</p>
<p>to connect a producer and a consumer in an economic way, right?</p>
<p>No one wants to pay for anything.</p>
<p>And so they all, you know, starting with Google and Facebook, they went back to the playbook</p>
<p>of, you know, the television companies back in the day.</p>
<p>No one wanted to pay for this signal.</p>
<p>They will pay for the TV box, but not for the signal, at least back in the day.</p>
<p>And so advertising kind of filled that gap and advertising was new and interesting and</p>
<p>it somehow didn&rsquo;t take over our lives quite, right?</p>
<p>Fast forward, Google provides a service that people don&rsquo;t want to pay for.</p>
<p>And so somewhat surprisingly in the nineties, they made, they ended up making huge amounts</p>
<p>so they cornered the advertising market.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t seem like that was going to happen, at least to me.</p>
<p>These little things on the right hand side of the screen just did not seem all that economically</p>
<p>interesting, but that companies had maybe no other choice.</p>
<p>The TV market was going away and billboards and so on.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve, they got it.</p>
<p>And I think that sadly that Google just has, it was doing so well with that at making such</p>
<p>money.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t think much more about how, wait a minute, is there a producer consumer relationship</p>
<p>to be set up here?</p>
<p>Not just between us and the advertisers market to be created.</p>
<p>Is there an actual market between the producer consumer?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the producers, the person who created that video clip, the person that made that</p>
<p>website, the person who could make more such things, the person who could adjust it as</p>
<p>a function of demand, the person on the other side who&rsquo;s asking for different kinds of things,</p>
<p>you know?</p>
<p>So you see glimmers of that now there&rsquo;s influencers and there&rsquo;s kind of a little glimmering of</p>
<p>a market, but it should have been done 20 years ago.</p>
<p>It should have been thought about.</p>
<p>It should have been created in parallel with the advertising ecosystem.</p>
<p>And then Facebook inherited that.</p>
<p>And I think they also didn&rsquo;t think very much about that.</p>
<p>So fast forward and now they are making huge amounts of money off of advertising.</p>
<p>And the news thing and all these clicks is just feeding the advertising.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all connected up to the advertiser.</p>
<p>So you want more people to click on certain things because that money flows to you, Facebook.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very much incentivized to do that.</p>
<p>And when you start to find it&rsquo;s breaking, people are telling you, well, we&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>into some troubles.</p>
<p>You try to adjust it with your smart AI algorithms, right?</p>
<p>And figure out what are bad clicks.</p>
<p>So maybe it shouldn&rsquo;t be click through rate, it should be something else.</p>
<p>I find that pretty much hopeless.</p>
<p>It does get into all the complexity of human life and you can try to fix it.</p>
<p>You should, but you could also fix the whole business model.</p>
<p>And the business model is that really, what are, are there some human producers and consumers</p>
<p>out there?</p>
<p>Is there some economic value to be liberated by connecting them directly?</p>
<p>Is it such that it&rsquo;s so valuable that people will be able to pay for it?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>And micro payments, like small payments.</p>
<p>Micro, but even have to be micro.</p>
<p>So I like the example, suppose I&rsquo;m going, next week I&rsquo;m going to India.</p>
<p>Never been to India before.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I have a couple of days in Mumbai, I have no idea what to do there.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And I could go on the web right now and search.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be kind of hopeless.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to find, you know, I have lots of advertisers in my face.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>What I really want to do is broadcast to the world that I am going to Mumbai and have someone</p>
<p>on the other side of a market look at me and, and there&rsquo;s a recommendation system there.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not looking at all possible people coming to Mumbai.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re looking at the people who are relevant to them.</p>
<p>So someone in my age group, someone who kind of knows me in some level, I give up a little</p>
<p>privacy by that, but I&rsquo;m happy because what I&rsquo;m going to get back is this person can make</p>
<p>a little video for me, or they&rsquo;re going to write a little two page paper on here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>cool things that you want to do and move by this week, especially, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to look at that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to pay a micro payment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to pay, you know, a hundred dollars or whatever for that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s real value.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like journalism.</p>
<p>Um, and as an honest subscription, it&rsquo;s that I&rsquo;m going to pay that person in that moment.</p>
<p>Company&rsquo;s going to take 5% of that.</p>
<p>And that person has now got it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a gig economy, if you will, but you know, done for it, you know, thinking about a little</p>
<p>bit behind YouTube, there was actually people who could make more of those things.</p>
<p>If they were connected to a market, they would make more of those things independently.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to tell them what to do.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to incentivize them any other way.</p>
<p>Um, and so, yeah, these companies, I don&rsquo;t think have thought long and hard about that.</p>
<p>So I do distinguish on Facebook on the one side, who just not thought about these things</p>
<p>at all.</p>
<p>I think, uh, thinking that AI will fix everything, uh, and Amazon thinks about them all the time</p>
<p>because they were already out in the real world.</p>
<p>They were delivering packages, people&rsquo;s doors.</p>
<p>They were, they were worried about a market.</p>
<p>They were worried about sellers and, you know, they worry and some things they do are great.</p>
<p>Some things maybe not so great, but you know, they&rsquo;re in that business model.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;d say Google sort of hovers somewhere in between.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t think for a long, long time they got it.</p>
<p>I think they probably see that YouTube is more pregnant with possibility than, than,</p>
<p>than they might&rsquo;ve thought and that they&rsquo;re probably heading that direction.</p>
<p>Um, but uh, you know, Silicon Valley has been dominated by the Google Facebook kind of mentality</p>
<p>and the subscription and advertising and that is, that&rsquo;s the core problem, right?</p>
<p>The fake news actually rides on top of that because it means that you&rsquo;re monetizing with</p>
<p>clip through rate and that is the core problem.</p>
<p>You got to remove that.</p>
<p>So advertisement, if we&rsquo;re going to linger on that, I mean, that&rsquo;s an interesting thesis.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if everyone really deeply thinks about that.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>The thought is the advertising model is the only thing we have, the only thing we&rsquo;ll ever</p>
<p>have.</p>
<p>We have to fix, we have to build algorithms that despite that business model, you know,</p>
<p>find the better angels of our nature and do good by society and by the individual.</p>
<p>But you think we can slowly, you think, first of all, there&rsquo;s a difference between should</p>
<p>and could.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying we should slowly move away from the advertising model and have a direct</p>
<p>connection between the consumer and the creator.</p>
<p>The question I also have is, can we, because the advertising model is so successful now</p>
<p>in terms of just making a huge amount of money and therefore being able to build a big company</p>
<p>that provides, has really smart people working that create a good service.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible?</p>
<p>And just to clarify, you think we should move away?</p>
<p>Well, I think we should.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But we is the, you know, me.</p>
<p>So society.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, the companies, I mean, so first of all, full disclosure, I&rsquo;m doing a day a week at</p>
<p>Amazon because I kind of want to learn more about how they do things.</p>
<p>So, you know, I&rsquo;m not speaking for Amazon in any way, but, you know, I did go there</p>
<p>because I actually believe they get a little bit of this or trying to create these markets.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t really use, advertising is not a crucial part of it.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>So it has become not crucial, but it&rsquo;s become more and more present if you go to Amazon</p>
<p>website.</p>
<p>And, you know, without revealing too many deep secrets about Amazon, I can tell you</p>
<p>that, you know, a lot of people in the company question this and there&rsquo;s a huge questioning</p>
<p>going on.</p>
<p>You do not want a world where there&rsquo;s zero advertising.</p>
<p>That actually is a bad world.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a way to think about it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a company that like Amazon is trying to bring products to customers, right?</p>
<p>And the customer, at any given moment, you want to buy a vacuum cleaner, say, you want</p>
<p>to know what&rsquo;s available for me.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s not going to be that obvious.</p>
<p>You have to do a little bit of work at it.</p>
<p>The recommendation system will sort of help, right?</p>
<p>But now suppose this other person over here has just made the world, you know, they spent</p>
<p>a huge amount of energy.</p>
<p>They had a great idea.</p>
<p>They made a great vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p>They know they really did it.</p>
<p>They nailed it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an MIT, you know, whiz kid that made a great new vacuum cleaner, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to be in the recommendation system.</p>
<p>No one will know about it.</p>
<p>The algorithms will not find it and AI will not fix that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>At all.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>How do you allow that vacuum cleaner to start to get in front of people, be sold well advertising.</p>
<p>And here, what advertising is, it&rsquo;s a signal that you&rsquo;re, you believe in your product enough</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re willing to pay some real money for it.</p>
<p>And to me as a consumer, I look at that signal.</p>
<p>I say, well, first of all, I know these are not just cheap little ads cause we have now</p>
<p>right now there.</p>
<p>I know that, you know, these are super cheap, you know, pennies.</p>
<p>If I see an ad where it&rsquo;s actually, I know the company is only doing a few of these and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re making, you know, real money is kind of flowing and I see an ad, I may pay more</p>
<p>attention to it.</p>
<p>And I actually might want that because I see, Hey, that guy spent money on his vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s something good there.</p>
<p>So I will look at it.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s part of the overall information flow in a good market.</p>
<p>So advertising has a role, but the problem is of course that that signal is now completely</p>
<p>gone because it just, you know, dominant by these tiny little things that add up to big</p>
<p>money for the company, you know?</p>
<p>So I think it will just, I think it will change because the societies just don&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>stick with things that annoy a lot of people and advertising currently annoys people more</p>
<p>than it provides information.</p>
<p>And I think that a Google probably is smart enough to figure out that this is a dead,</p>
<p>this is a bad model, even though it&rsquo;s a hard, huge amount of money and they&rsquo;ll have to figure</p>
<p>out how to pull it away from it slowly.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure the CEO there will figure it out, but they need to do it.</p>
<p>And they needed it to, so if you reduce advertising, not to zero, but you reduce it at the same</p>
<p>time you bring up producer, consumer, actual real value being delivered.</p>
<p>So real money is being paid and they take a 5% cut that 5% could start to get big enough</p>
<p>to cancel out the lost revenue from the kind of the poor kind of advertising.</p>
<p>And I think that a good company will do that, will realize that.</p>
<p>And Facebook, you know, again, God bless them.</p>
<p>They bring, you know, grandmothers, they bring children&rsquo;s pictures into grandmothers lives.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>But they need to think of a new business model and that&rsquo;s the core problem there.</p>
<p>Until they start to connect producer consumer, I think they will just continue to make money</p>
<p>and then buy the next social network company and then buy the next one and the innovation</p>
<p>level will not be high and the health issues will not go away.</p>
<p>So I apologize that we kind of returned to words, I don&rsquo;t think the exact terms matter,</p>
<p>but in sort of defense of advertisement, don&rsquo;t you think the kind of direct connection between</p>
<p>consumer and creator producer is what advertisement strives to do, right?</p>
<p>So that is best advertisement is literally now Facebook is listening to our conversation</p>
<p>and heard that you&rsquo;re going to India and will be able to actually start automatically for</p>
<p>you making these connections and start giving this offer.</p>
<p>So like, I apologize if it&rsquo;s just a matter of terms, but just to draw a distinction,</p>
<p>is it possible to make advertisements just better and better and better algorithmically</p>
<p>to where it actually becomes a connection, almost a direct connection?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s component on that.</p>
<p>First of all, what we just talked about, I was defending advertising.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I was defending it as a way to get signals into a market that don&rsquo;t come any other way,</p>
<p>especially algorithmically.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sign that someone spent money on it, it&rsquo;s a sign they think it&rsquo;s valuable.</p>
<p>And if I think that if other things, someone else thinks it&rsquo;s valuable, and if I trust</p>
<p>other people, I might be willing to listen.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t trust that Facebook though, who&rsquo;s an intermediary between this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they care about me.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they do.</p>
<p>And I find it creepy that they know I&rsquo;m going to India next week because of our conversation.</p>
<p>Why do you think that is?</p>
<p>So what, could you just put your PR hat on?</p>
<p>Why do you think you find Facebook creepy and not trust them as do majority of the population?</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re out of the Silicon Valley companies, I saw like not approval rate, but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ranking of how much people trust companies and Facebook is in the gutter.</p>
<p>In the gutter, including people inside of Facebook.</p>
<p>So what do you attribute that to?</p>
<p>Because when I&hellip;</p>
<p>Come on, you don&rsquo;t find it creepy that right now we&rsquo;re talking that I might walk out on</p>
<p>the street right now that some unknown person who I don&rsquo;t know kind of comes up to me and</p>
<p>says, I hear you&rsquo;re going to India.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s not even Facebook.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just, I want transparency in human society.</p>
<p>I want to have, if you know something about me, there&rsquo;s actually some reason you know</p>
<p>something about me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that if I look at it later and audit it kind of, I approve.</p>
<p>You know something about me because you care in some way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a caring relationship even, or an economic one or something.</p>
<p>Not just that you&rsquo;re someone who could exploit it in ways I don&rsquo;t know about or care about</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m troubled by or whatever.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in a world right now where that happens way too much and that Facebook knows things</p>
<p>about a lot of people and could exploit it and does exploit it at times.</p>
<p>I think most people do find that creepy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not for them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that Facebook is not doing it because they care about them in a real sense.</p>
<p>And they shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They should not be a big brother caring about us.</p>
<p>That is not the role of a company like that.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Wait, not the big brother part, but the caring, the trusting.</p>
<p>I mean, don&rsquo;t those companies, just to link on it because a lot of companies have a lot</p>
<p>of information about us.</p>
<p>I would argue that there&rsquo;s companies like Microsoft that has more information about</p>
<p>us than Facebook does and yet we trust Microsoft more.</p>
<p>Well, Microsoft is pivoting.</p>
<p>Microsoft, you know, under Satya Nadella has decided this is really important.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to do creepy things.</p>
<p>Really want people to trust us to actually only use information in ways that they really</p>
<p>would approve of, that we don&rsquo;t decide, right?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just kind of adding that the health of a market is that when I connect to someone</p>
<p>who produces a consumer, it&rsquo;s not just a random producer or consumer, it&rsquo;s people who see</p>
<p>each other.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t like each other, but they sense that if they transact, some happiness will</p>
<p>go up on both sides.</p>
<p>If a company helps me to do that in moments that I choose of my choosing, then fine.</p>
<p>So, and also think about the difference between, you know, browsing versus buying, right?</p>
<p>There are moments in my life I just want to buy, you know, a gadget or something.</p>
<p>I need something for that moment.</p>
<p>I need some ammonia for my house or something because I got a problem with a spill.</p>
<p>I want to just go in.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be advertised at that moment.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be led down various, you know, that&rsquo;s annoying.</p>
<p>I want to just go and have it be extremely easy to do what I want.</p>
<p>Other moments I might say, no, it&rsquo;s like today I&rsquo;m going to the shopping mall.</p>
<p>I want to walk around and see things and see people and be exposed to stuff.</p>
<p>So I want control over that though.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want the company&rsquo;s algorithms to decide for me, right?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a total loss of control if Facebook thinks they should take the control from us</p>
<p>of deciding when we want to have certain kinds of information, when we don&rsquo;t, what information</p>
<p>that is, how much it relates to what they know about us that we didn&rsquo;t really want them</p>
<p>to know about us.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want them to be helping me in that way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want them to be helping them by they decide they have control over what I want</p>
<p>and when.</p>
<p>I totally agree.</p>
<p>Facebook, by the way, I have this optimistic thing where I think Facebook has the kind</p>
<p>of personal information about us that could create a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m really optimistic of what Facebook could do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not what it&rsquo;s doing, but what it could do.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t see that.</p>
<p>I think that optimism is misplaced because there&rsquo;s not a bit, you have to have a business</p>
<p>model behind these things.</p>
<p>Create a beautiful thing is really, let&rsquo;s be, let&rsquo;s be clear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about something that people would value.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think they have that business model and I don&rsquo;t think they will suddenly</p>
<p>discover it by what, you know, a long hot shower.</p>
<p>I disagree.</p>
<p>I disagree in terms of, you can discover a lot of amazing things in a shower.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t say that.</p>
<p>I said, they won&rsquo;t come, they won&rsquo;t do it, but in the shower, I think a lot of other</p>
<p>people will discover it.</p>
<p>I think that this guy, so I should also, full disclosure, there&rsquo;s a company called United</p>
<p>Masters, which I&rsquo;m on their board and they&rsquo;ve created this music market and I have a hundred</p>
<p>thousand artists now signed on and they&rsquo;ve done things like gone to the NBA and the NBA,</p>
<p>the music you find behind NBA clips right now is their music, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a company that had the right business model in mind from the get go, right?</p>
<p>Executed on that.</p>
<p>And from day one, there was value brought to, so here you have a kid who made some songs</p>
<p>who suddenly their songs are on the NBA website, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s real economic value to people.</p>
<p>And so, you know, so you and I differ on the optimism of being able to sort of change the</p>
<p>direction of the Titanic, right?</p>
<p>So I, yeah, I&rsquo;m older than you, so I&rsquo;ve seen some Titanic&rsquo;s crash, got it.</p>
<p>But and just to elaborate, cause I totally agree with you and I just want to know how</p>
<p>difficult you think this problem is of, so for example, I want to read some news and</p>
<p>I would, there&rsquo;s a lot of times in the day where something makes me either smile or think</p>
<p>in a way where I like consciously think this really gave me value.</p>
<p>Like I sometimes listen to the daily podcasts in the New York times, way better than the</p>
<p>New York times themselves, by the way, for people listening.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like real journalism is happening for some reason in the podcast space.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me, but often I listen to it 20 minutes and I would be willing to</p>
<p>pay for that, like $5, $10 for that experience.</p>
<p>And how difficult, that&rsquo;s kind of what you&rsquo;re getting at is that little transaction.</p>
<p>How difficult is it to create a frictionless system like Uber has, for example, for other</p>
<p>things?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your intuition there?</p>
<p>So I, first of all, I pay little bits of money to, you know, to send, there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>called courts that does financial things.</p>
<p>I like medium as a site, I don&rsquo;t pay there, but I would.</p>
<p>You had a great post on medium.</p>
<p>I would have loved to pay you a dollar and not others.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted it per se because there should be also sites where that&rsquo;s not actually</p>
<p>the goal.</p>
<p>The goal is to actually have a broadcast channel that I monetize in some other way if I chose</p>
<p>to.</p>
<p>I mean, I could now people know about it.</p>
<p>I could, I&rsquo;m not doing it, but that&rsquo;s fine with me.</p>
<p>Also the musicians who are making all this music, I don&rsquo;t think the right model is that</p>
<p>you pay a little subscription fee to them, right?</p>
<p>Because people can copy the bits too easily and it&rsquo;s just not that somewhere the value</p>
<p>is.</p>
<p>The value is that a connection was made between real human beings, then you can follow up</p>
<p>on that.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>And create yet more value.</p>
<p>So no, I think there&rsquo;s a lot of open questions here, hot open questions, but also, yeah,</p>
<p>I do want good recommendation systems that recommend cool stuff to me.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s pretty hard, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like them to recommend stuff just based on my browsing history.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the based on stuff they know about me, quote unquote.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s unknown about me is the most interesting.</p>
<p>So this is the, this is the really interesting question.</p>
<p>We may disagree, maybe not.</p>
<p>I think that I love recommender systems and I want to give them everything about me in</p>
<p>a way that I trust.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But you, but you don&rsquo;t, because, so for example, this morning I clicked on a, you know, I was</p>
<p>pretty sleepy this morning.</p>
<p>I clicked on a story about the queen of England.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I do not give a damn about the queen of England.</p>
<p>I really do not.</p>
<p>But it was clickbait.</p>
<p>It kind of looked funny and I had to say, what the heck are they talking about?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to have my life, you know, heading that direction.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s in my browsing history.</p>
<p>The system in any reasonable system will think that I care about the queen of England.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s browsing history.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But, but you&rsquo;re saying all the trace, all the digital exhaust or whatever, that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>kind of the models.</p>
<p>If you collect all this stuff, you&rsquo;re going to figure all of us out.</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;re trying to figure out like kind of one person like Trump or something,</p>
<p>maybe you could figure him out.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re trying to figure out, you know, 500 million people, you know, no way, no way.</p>
<p>You think so?</p>
<p>No, I do.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>I think we are, humans are just amazingly rich and complicated.</p>
<p>Every one of us has our little quirks, every one of us has our little things that could</p>
<p>intrigue us that we don&rsquo;t even know it will intrigue us.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no sign of it in our past, but by God, there it comes and you know, you fall</p>
<p>in love with it.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want a company trying to figure that out for me and anticipate that I want</p>
<p>them to provide a forum, a market, a place that I kind of go and by hook or by crook,</p>
<p>this happens, you know, I I&rsquo;m walking down the street and I hear some Chilean music being</p>
<p>played and I never knew I liked Chilean music, but wow.</p>
<p>So there is that side and I want them to provide a limited, but you know, interesting place</p>
<p>to go.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so don&rsquo;t try to use your AI to kind of, you know, figure me out and then put me in</p>
<p>a world where you figured me out, you know, no, create huge spaces for human beings where</p>
<p>our creativity and our style will be enriched and come forward and it&rsquo;ll be a lot of more</p>
<p>transparency.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t have people randomly, anonymously putting comments up and I&rsquo;ll special based</p>
<p>on stuff they know about me, facts that, you know, we are so broken right now.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re, you know, especially if you&rsquo;re a celebrity, but you know, it&rsquo;s about anybody</p>
<p>that anonymous people are hurting lots and lots of people right now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of this thing that Silicon Valley is thinking that, you know, just collect all</p>
<p>this information and use it in a great way.</p>
<p>So no, I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m not a pessimist, I&rsquo;m very much an optimist by nature, but I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just been the wrong path for the whole technology to take.</p>
<p>Be more limited, create, let humans rise up.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to replace them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the AI mantra.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to anticipate them.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to predict them because you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re not going to, you&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to be able to do those things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to make things worse.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So right now, just give this a chance.</p>
<p>Right now, the recommender systems are the creepy people in the shadow watching your</p>
<p>every move.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re looking at traces of you.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not directly interacting with you, sort of the, your close friends and family,</p>
<p>the way they know you is by having conversation, by actually having interactions back and forth.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a place for recommender systems sort of to step, cause you, you just</p>
<p>emphasize the value of human to human connection, but yeah, just give it a chance, AI human</p>
<p>connection.</p>
<p>Is there a role for an AI system to have conversations with you in terms of, to try to figure out</p>
<p>what kind of music you like, not by just watching what you listening to, but actually having</p>
<p>a conversation, natural language or otherwise.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m, so I&rsquo;m not against it.</p>
<p>I just wanted to push back against the, maybe you&rsquo;re saying you have options for Facebook.</p>
<p>So there I think it&rsquo;s misplaced, but, but I think that distributing, yeah, no, so good</p>
<p>for you.</p>
<p>Go for it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hard spot to be in.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, good.</p>
<p>Human interaction, like on our daily, the context around me in my own home is something</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t want some big company to know about at all, but I would be more than happy</p>
<p>to have technology help me with it.</p>
<p>Which kind of technology?</p>
<p>Well, you know, just, Alexa, Amazon, well, a good, Alexa&rsquo;s done right.</p>
<p>And I think Alexa is a research platform right now more than anything else.</p>
<p>But Alexa done right, you know, could do things like I, I leave the water running in my garden</p>
<p>and I say, Hey, Alexa, the water&rsquo;s running in my garden.</p>
<p>And even have Alexa figure out that that means when my wife comes home, that she should be</p>
<p>told about that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a little bit of a reasoning.</p>
<p>I would call that AI and by any kind of stretch, it&rsquo;s a little bit of reasoning and it actually</p>
<p>kind of would make my life a little easier and better.</p>
<p>And you know, I don&rsquo;t, I wouldn&rsquo;t call this a wow moment, but I kind of think that overall</p>
<p>rises human happiness up to have that kind of thing.</p>
<p>But not when you&rsquo;re lonely, Alexa, knowing loneliness.</p>
<p>No, no, I don&rsquo;t want Alexa to be, feel intrusive.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want just the designer of the system to kind of work all this out.</p>
<p>I really want to have a lot of control and I want transparency and control.</p>
<p>And if a company can stand up and give me that in the context of new technology, I think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>First of all, be way more successful than our current generation.</p>
<p>And like I said, I was mentioning Microsoft, I really think they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re pivoting to</p>
<p>kind of be the trusted old uncle, but you know, I think that they get that this is a</p>
<p>way to go, that if you let people find technology, empowers them to have more control and have</p>
<p>and have control, not just over privacy, but over this rich set of interactions, that that</p>
<p>people are going to like that a lot more.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s the right business model going forward.</p>
<p>What does control over privacy look like?</p>
<p>Do you think you should be able to just view all the data that?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s much more than that.</p>
<p>I mean, first of all, it should be an individual decision.</p>
<p>Some people don&rsquo;t want privacy.</p>
<p>They want their whole life out there.</p>
<p>Other people&rsquo;s want it.</p>
<p>Privacy is not a zero one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a legal thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about which data is available, which is not.</p>
<p>I like to recall to people that, you know, a couple hundred years ago, everyone, there</p>
<p>was not really big cities, everyone lived in on the countryside and villages and villages.</p>
<p>Everybody knew everything about you.</p>
<p>Very, you didn&rsquo;t have any privacy.</p>
<p>Is that bad?</p>
<p>Are we better off now?</p>
<p>Well, you know, arguably no, because what did you get for that loss of certain kinds</p>
<p>of privacy?</p>
<p>Well, people help each other if they, because they know everything about you.</p>
<p>They know something&rsquo;s bad&rsquo;s happening, they will help you with that.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And now you live in a big city, no one knows about that.</p>
<p>You get no help.</p>
<p>So it kind of depends the answer.</p>
<p>I want certain people who I trust and there should be relationships.</p>
<p>I should kind of manage all those, but who knows what about me?</p>
<p>I should have some agency there.</p>
<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t, I shouldn&rsquo;t be a drift in a sea of technology where I have no agency.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to go reading things and checking boxes.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know how to do that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not a privacy researcher per se.</p>
<p>I just, I recognize the vast complexity of this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just technology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just legal scholars meeting technologists.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gotta be kind of a whole layers around it.</p>
<p>And so I, when I alluded to this emerging engineering field, this is a big part of it.</p>
<p>When electrical engineering came, I&rsquo;m not one around at the time, but you just didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>plug electricity into walls and all kinds of work.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to have like underwriters laboratory that reassured you that that plug&rsquo;s not going</p>
<p>to burn up your house and that that machine will do this and that and everything.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be whole people who can install things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be people who can watch the installers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be a whole layers, you know, an onion of these kinds of things.</p>
<p>And for things as deep and interesting as privacy, which is as least as interesting</p>
<p>as electricity, that&rsquo;s going to take decades to kind of work out, but it&rsquo;s going to require</p>
<p>a lot of new structures that we don&rsquo;t have right now.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of hard to talk about it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying there&rsquo;s a lot of money to be made if you get it right.</p>
<p>So something you should look at.</p>
<p>A lot of money to be made in all these things that provide human services and people recognize</p>
<p>them as useful parts of their lives.</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<p>So yeah, the dialogue sometimes goes from the exuberant technologists to the no technology</p>
<p>is good, kind of.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, you know, in our public discourse, you know, and as far as you see too much of</p>
<p>this kind of thing and the sober discussions in the middle, which are the challenge he</p>
<p>wants to have or where we need to be having our conversations.</p>
<p>And you know, there&rsquo;s just not actually, there&rsquo;s not many forum fora for those.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s kind of what I would look for.</p>
<p>Maybe I could go and I could read a comment section of something and it would actually</p>
<p>be this kind of dialogue going back and forth.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see much of this, right?</p>
<p>Which is why actually there&rsquo;s a resurgence of podcasts out of all, because people are</p>
<p>really hungry for conversation, but there&rsquo;s technology is not helping much.</p>
<p>So comment sections of anything, including YouTube is not hurting and not helping.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you think technically speaking, it&rsquo;s possible to help.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the answers, but it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a less anonymity, a little more locality,</p>
<p>you know, worlds that you kind of enter in and you trust the people there in those worlds</p>
<p>so that when you start having a discussion, you know, not only is that people are not</p>
<p>going to hurt you, but it&rsquo;s not going to be a total waste of your time because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of wasting of time that, you know, a lot of us, I pulled out of Facebook early</p>
<p>on cause it was clearly going to waste a lot of my time even though there was some value.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, worlds that are somehow you enter in and you know what you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of appeals to you and you might, new things might happen, but you kind of have</p>
<p>some, some trust in that world.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some deep, interesting, complex psychological aspects around anonymity, how</p>
<p>that changes human behavior that&rsquo;s quite dark.</p>
<p>Quite dark.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think a lot of us are, especially those of us who really loved the advent of technology.</p>
<p>I love social networks when they came out.</p>
<p>I was just, I didn&rsquo;t see any negatives there at all.</p>
<p>But then I started seeing comment sections.</p>
<p>I think it was maybe, you know, with the CNN or something.</p>
<p>And I started to go, wow, this, this darkness I just did not know about and, and our technology</p>
<p>is now amplifying it.</p>
<p>So sorry for the big philosophical question, but on that topic, do you think human beings,</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;ve also, out of all things, had a foot in psychology too, the, do you think</p>
<p>human beings are fundamentally good?</p>
<p>Like all of us have good intent that could be mind or is it depending on context and</p>
<p>environment, everybody could be evil.</p>
<p>So my answer is fundamentally good.</p>
<p>But fundamentally limited.</p>
<p>All of us have very, you know, blinkers on.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t see the other person&rsquo;s pain that easily.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t see the other person&rsquo;s point of view that easily.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very much in our own head, in our own world.</p>
<p>And on my good days, I think the technology could open us up to, you know, more perspectives</p>
<p>and more less blinkered and more understanding, you know, a lot of wars in human history happened</p>
<p>because of just ignorance.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t, they, they thought the other person was doing this while their person wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>doing this.</p>
<p>And we have a huge amounts of that.</p>
<p>But in my lifetime, I&rsquo;ve not seen technology really help in that way yet.</p>
<p>And I do, I do, I do believe in that, but you know, no, I think fundamentally humans</p>
<p>are good.</p>
<p>The people suffer, people have grievances because you have grudges and those things</p>
<p>cause them to do things they probably wouldn&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p>They regret it often.</p>
<p>So no, I, I think it&rsquo;s a, you know, part of the progress of technology is to indeed allow</p>
<p>it to be a little easier to be the real good person you actually are.</p>
<p>Well, but do you think individual human life or society could be modeled as an optimization</p>
<p>problem?</p>
<p>Not the way I think typically, I mean, that&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re talking about one of the most complex</p>
<p>phenomenon in the whole, you know, in all of which the individual human life or society</p>
<p>as a whole.</p>
<p>Both, both.</p>
<p>I mean, individual human life is amazingly complex.</p>
<p>And so you know, optimization is kind of just one branch of mathematics that talks about</p>
<p>certain kinds of things.</p>
<p>And it just feels way too limited for the complexity of such things.</p>
<p>What properties of optimization problems do you think, so do you think most interesting</p>
<p>problems that could be solved through optimization, what kind of properties does that surface</p>
<p>have non convexity, convexity, linearity, all those kinds of things, saddle points?</p>
<p>Well, so optimization is just one piece of mathematics.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s like, you just, even in our era, we&rsquo;re aware that say sampling is</p>
<p>coming up, examples of something coming up with a distribution.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s optimization?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s sampling?</p>
<p>Well, they, you can, if you&rsquo;re a kind of a certain kind of mathematician, you can try</p>
<p>to blend them and make them seem to be sort of the same thing.</p>
<p>But optimization is roughly speaking, trying to find a point that, a single point that</p>
<p>is the optimum of a criterion function of some kind.</p>
<p>And sampling is trying to, from that same surface, treat that as a distribution or density</p>
<p>and find points that have high density.</p>
<p>So I want the entire distribution in a sampling paradigm and I want the, you know, the single</p>
<p>point, that&rsquo;s the best point in the optimization paradigm.</p>
<p>Now if you were optimizing in the space of probability measures, the output of that could</p>
<p>be a whole probability distribution.</p>
<p>So you can start to make these things the same.</p>
<p>But in mathematics, if you go too high up that kind of abstraction hierarchy, you start</p>
<p>to lose the, you know, the ability to do the interesting theorems.</p>
<p>So you kind of don&rsquo;t try that.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t try to overly over abstract.</p>
<p>So as a small tangent, what kind of worldview do you find more appealing?</p>
<p>One that is deterministic or stochastic?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m a statistician.</p>
<p>You know, the world is highly stochastic.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen in the next five minutes, right?</p>
<p>Because what you&rsquo;re going to ask, what we&rsquo;re going to do, what I&rsquo;ll say.</p>
<p>Due to the uncertainty.</p>
<p>Due to the&hellip;</p>
<p>Massive uncertainty.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, massive uncertainty.</p>
<p>And so the best I can do is have come rough sense or probability distribution on things</p>
<p>and somehow use that in my reasoning about what to do now.</p>
<p>So how does the distributed at scale when you have multi agent systems look like?</p>
<p>So optimization can optimize sort of, it makes a lot more sense, sort of at least from my</p>
<p>from robotics perspective, for a single robot, for a single agent, trying to optimize some</p>
<p>objective function.</p>
<p>When you start to enter the real world, this game theoretic concept starts popping up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how do you see optimization in this?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ve talked about markets in a scale.</p>
<p>What does that look like?</p>
<p>Do you see it as optimization?</p>
<p>Do you see it as sampling?</p>
<p>Do you see like, how should you mark?</p>
<p>These all blend together.</p>
<p>And a system designer thinking about how to build an incentivized system will have a blend</p>
<p>of all these things.</p>
<p>So, you know, a particle in a potential well is optimizing a functional called a Lagrangian,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>The particle doesn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no algorithm running that does that.</p>
<p>It just happens.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a description mathematically of something that helps us understand as analysts</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening, right?</p>
<p>And so the same thing will happen when we talk about, you know, mixtures of humans and</p>
<p>computers and markets and so on and so forth, there&rsquo;ll be certain principles that allow</p>
<p>us to understand what&rsquo;s happening, whether or not the actual algorithms are being used</p>
<p>by any sense is not clear.</p>
<p>Now at some point, I may have set up a multi agent or market kind of system.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m now thinking about an individual agent in that system.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re asked to do some task and they&rsquo;re incentivized in some way, they get certain</p>
<p>signals and they have some utility.</p>
<p>What they will do at that point is they just won&rsquo;t know the answer, they may have to optimize</p>
<p>to find an answer.</p>
<p>Okay, so an artist could be embedded inside of an overall market.</p>
<p>You know, and game theory is very, very broad.</p>
<p>It is often studied very narrowly for certain kinds of problems.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s roughly speaking, this is just the, I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re going to do.</p>
<p>So I kind of anticipate that a little bit, and you anticipate what I&rsquo;m anticipating.</p>
<p>And we kind of go back and forth in our own minds.</p>
<p>We run kind of thought experiments.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked about this interesting point in terms of game theory, you know, most optimization</p>
<p>problems really hate saddle points, maybe you can describe what saddle points are.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve heard you kind of mentioned that there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a branch of optimization</p>
<p>that you could try to explicitly look for saddle points as a good thing.</p>
<p>Oh, not optimization.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just game theory that that so there&rsquo;s all kinds of different equilibria in game</p>
<p>theory.</p>
<p>And some of them are highly explanatory behavior.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not attempting to be algorithmic.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just trying to say, if you happen to be at this equilibrium, you would see certain</p>
<p>kind of behavior.</p>
<p>And we see that in real life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what an economist wants to do, especially behavioral economists in continuous differential</p>
<p>game theory, you&rsquo;re in continuous spaces, a some of the simplest equilibria are saddle</p>
<p>points and Nash equilibrium as a saddle point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a special kind of saddle point.</p>
<p>So classically, in game theory, you were trying to find Nash equilibria and an algorithmic</p>
<p>game theory, you&rsquo;re trying to find algorithms that would find them.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re trying to find saddle points.</p>
<p>I mean, so that&rsquo;s literally what you&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>But you know, any economist knows that Nash equilibria have their limitations.</p>
<p>They are definitely not that explanatory in many situations.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not what you really want.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other kind of equilibria.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s names associated with these because they came from history with certain people</p>
<p>working on them, but there will be new ones emerging.</p>
<p>So you know, one example is a Stackelberg equilibrium.</p>
<p>So you know, Nash, you and I are both playing this game against each other or for each other,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s cooperative, and we&rsquo;re both going to think it through and then we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>decide and we&rsquo;re going to do our thing simultaneously.</p>
<p>You know, in a Stackelberg, no, I&rsquo;m going to be the first mover.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to make a move.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to look at my move and then you&rsquo;re going to make yours.</p>
<p>Now since I know you&rsquo;re going to look at my move, I anticipate what you&rsquo;re going to do.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t do something stupid, but then I know that you are also anticipating me.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re kind of going back and forth on why, but there is then a first mover thing.</p>
<p>And so those are different equilibria, right?</p>
<p>And so just mathematically, yeah, these things have certain topologies and certain shapes</p>
<p>that are like, what&rsquo;s it, algorithmically or dynamically, how do you move towards them?</p>
<p>How do you move away from things?</p>
<p>You know, so some of these questions have answers, they&rsquo;ve been studied, others do not.</p>
<p>And especially if it becomes stochastic, especially if there&rsquo;s large numbers of decentralized</p>
<p>things, there&rsquo;s just, you know, young people get in this field who kind of think it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>done because we have, you know, TensorFlow.</p>
<p>Well, no, these are all open problems and they&rsquo;re really important and interesting.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s about strategic settings.</p>
<p>How do I collect data?</p>
<p>Suppose I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re going to do because I don&rsquo;t know you very well, right?</p>
<p>Well, I got to collect data about you.</p>
<p>So maybe I want to push you into a part of the space where I don&rsquo;t know much about you</p>
<p>so I can get data.</p>
<p>Cause, and then later I&rsquo;ll realize that you&rsquo;ll never, you&rsquo;ll never go there because of the</p>
<p>way the game is set up.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s part of the overall, you know, data analysis context is that.</p>
<p>Even the game of poker is fascinating space, whenever there&rsquo;s any uncertainty, a lack of</p>
<p>information, it&rsquo;s a super exciting space.</p>
<p>Just to linger on optimization for a second.</p>
<p>So when we look at deep learning, it&rsquo;s essentially minimization of a complicated loss function.</p>
<p>So is there something insightful or hopeful that you see in the kinds of function surface</p>
<p>that loss functions, the deep learning and in the real world is trying to optimize over?</p>
<p>Is there something interesting as it&rsquo;s just the usual kind of problems of optimization?</p>
<p>I think from an optimization point of view, that surface, first of all, it&rsquo;s pretty smooth.</p>
<p>And secondly, if there&rsquo;s over, if it&rsquo;s over parameterized, there&rsquo;s kind of lots of paths</p>
<p>down to reasonable Optima.</p>
<p>And so kind of the getting downhill to the, to an optimum is viewed as not as hard as</p>
<p>you might&rsquo;ve expected in high dimensions.</p>
<p>The fact that some Optima tend to be really good ones and others not so good.</p>
<p>And you tend to, it&rsquo;s not, sometimes you find the good ones is sort of still needs explanation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But, but the particular surface is coming from the particular generation of neural nets.</p>
<p>I kind of suspect those will, those will change in 10 years.</p>
<p>It will not be exactly those surfaces.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be some others that are an optimization theory will help contribute to why other surfaces</p>
<p>or why other algorithms.</p>
<p>Years of arithmetic operations with a little bit of nonlinearity, that&rsquo;s not, that didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>come from neuroscience per se.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe in the minds of some of the people working on it, they were thinking about</p>
<p>brains, but they were arithmetic circuits in all kinds of fields, computer science control</p>
<p>theory and so on.</p>
<p>And that layers of these could transform things in certain ways.</p>
<p>And that if it&rsquo;s smooth, maybe you could find parameter values is a sort of big discovery</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s working, it&rsquo;s able to work at this scale.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think that we&rsquo;re stuck with that and we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re certainly not stuck with</p>
<p>that cause we&rsquo;re understanding the brain.</p>
<p>So in terms of on the algorithm side sort of gradient descent, do you think we&rsquo;re stuck</p>
<p>with gradient descent as a variance of it?</p>
<p>What variance do you find interesting or do you think there&rsquo;ll be something else invented</p>
<p>that is able to walk all over these optimization spaces in more interesting ways?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a co design of the surface and the, or the architecture and the algorithm.</p>
<p>So if you just ask if we stay with the kind of architectures that we have now and not</p>
<p>just neural nets, but you know, phase retrieval architectures or matrix completion architectures</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>You know, I think we&rsquo;ve kind of come to a place where yeah, a stochastic gradient algorithms</p>
<p>are dominant and there are versions that are a little better than others.</p>
<p>They have more guarantees, they&rsquo;re more robust and so on.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s ongoing research to kind of figure out which is the best arm for which situation.</p>
<p>But I think that that&rsquo;ll start to co evolve, that that&rsquo;ll put pressure on the actual architecture.</p>
<p>And so we shouldn&rsquo;t do it in this particular way, we should do it in a different way because</p>
<p>this other algorithm is now available if you do it in a different way.</p>
<p>So that I can&rsquo;t really anticipate that co evolution process, but you know, gradients</p>
<p>are amazing mathematical objects.</p>
<p>They have a lot of people who start to study them more deeply mathematically are kind of</p>
<p>shocked about what they are and what they can do.</p>
<p>Think about it this way, suppose that I tell you if you move along the x axis, you go uphill</p>
<p>in some objective by three units, whereas if you move along the y axis, you go uphill</p>
<p>by seven units, right?</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m going to only allow you to move a certain unit distance, right?</p>
<p>What are you going to do?</p>
<p>Well, most people will say that I&rsquo;m going to go along the y axis, I&rsquo;m getting the biggest</p>
<p>bang for my buck, you know, and my buck is only one unit, so I&rsquo;m going to put all of</p>
<p>it in the y axis, right?</p>
<p>And why should I even take any of my strength, my step size and put any of it in the x axis</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m getting less bang for my buck.</p>
<p>That seems like a completely clear argument and it&rsquo;s wrong because the gradient direction</p>
<p>is not to go along the y axis, it&rsquo;s to take a little bit of the x axis.</p>
<p>And to understand that, you have to know some math and so even a trivial so called operator</p>
<p>like gradient is not trivial and so, you know, exploiting its properties is still very important.</p>
<p>Now we know that just pervading descent has got all kinds of problems, it gets stuck in</p>
<p>many ways and it had never, you know, good dimension dependence and so on.</p>
<p>So my own line of work recently has been about what kinds of stochasticity, how can we get</p>
<p>dimension dependence, how can we do the theory of that and we&rsquo;ve come up pretty favorable</p>
<p>results with certain kinds of stochasticity.</p>
<p>We have sufficient conditions generally.</p>
<p>We know if you do this, we will give you a good guarantee.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have necessary conditions that it must be done a certain way in general.</p>
<p>So stochasticity, how much randomness to inject into the walking along the gradient?</p>
<p>And what kind of randomness?</p>
<p>Why is randomness good in this process?</p>
<p>Why is stochasticity good?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I can give you simple answers but in some sense again, it&rsquo;s kind of amazing.</p>
<p>Stochasticity just, you know, particular features of a surface that could have hurt you if you</p>
<p>were doing one thing deterministically won&rsquo;t hurt you because by chance, there&rsquo;s very little</p>
<p>chance that you would get hurt.</p>
<p>So here stochasticity, it just kind of saves you from some of the particular features of</p>
<p>surfaces.</p>
<p>In fact, if you think about surfaces that are discontinuous in our first derivative,</p>
<p>like an absolute value function, you will go down and hit that point where there&rsquo;s nondifferentiability.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re running a deterministic algorithm at that point, you can really do something</p>
<p>bad.</p>
<p>Whereas stochasticity just means it&rsquo;s pretty unlikely that&rsquo;s going to happen, that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to hit that point.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s again, nontrivial to analyze but especially in higher dimensions, also stochasticity,</p>
<p>our intuition isn&rsquo;t very good about it but it has properties that kind of are very appealing</p>
<p>in high dimensions for a lot of large number of reasons.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all part of the mathematics to kind of, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s fun to work in the field</p>
<p>is that you get to try to understand this mathematics.</p>
<p>But long story short, you know, partly empirically, it was discovered stochastic gradient is very</p>
<p>effective and theory kind of followed, I&rsquo;d say, that but I don&rsquo;t see that we&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>clearly out of that.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the most beautiful, mysterious, a profound idea to you in optimization?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the most.</p>
<p>But let me just say that Nesterov&rsquo;s work on Nesterov acceleration to me is pretty surprising</p>
<p>and pretty deep.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate?</p>
<p>Well Nesterov acceleration is just that, suppose that we are going to use gradients</p>
<p>to move around in a space.</p>
<p>For the reasons I&rsquo;ve alluded to, they&rsquo;re nice directions to move.</p>
<p>And suppose that I tell you that you&rsquo;re only allowed to use gradients, you&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to be allowed to use this local person that can only sense kind of the change in the surface.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m going to give you kind of a computer that&rsquo;s able to store all your previous gradients.</p>
<p>And so you start to learn some something about the surface.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to restrict you to maybe move in the direction of like a linear span of</p>
<p>all the gradients.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t kind of just move in some arbitrary direction, right?</p>
<p>So now we have a well defined mathematical complexity model.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain classes of algorithms that can do that and others that can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And we can ask for certain kinds of surfaces, how fast can you get down to the optimum?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s answers to these.</p>
<p>So for a smooth convex function, there&rsquo;s an answer, which is one over the number of steps</p>
<p>squared.</p>
<p>You will be within a ball of that size after k steps.</p>
<p>Gradient descent in particular has a slower rate, it&rsquo;s one over k.</p>
<p>So you could ask, is gradient descent actually, even though we know it&rsquo;s a good algorithm,</p>
<p>is it the best algorithm?</p>
<p>And the answer is no.</p>
<p>Well, not clear yet, because one over k squared is a lower bound.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably the best you can do.</p>
<p>Gradient is one over k, but is there something better?</p>
<p>And so I think as a surprise to most, Nesterov discovered a new algorithm that has got two</p>
<p>pieces to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s two gradients and puts those together in a certain kind of obscure way.</p>
<p>And the thing doesn&rsquo;t even move downhill all the time.</p>
<p>It sometimes goes back uphill.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re a physicist, that kind of makes some sense.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re building up some momentum and that is kind of the right intuition, but that intuition</p>
<p>is not enough to understand kind of how to do it and why it works.</p>
<p>But it does.</p>
<p>It achieves one over k squared and it has a mathematical structure and it&rsquo;s still kind</p>
<p>of to this day, a lot of us are writing papers and trying to explore that and understand</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>So there are lots of cool ideas and optimization, but just kind of using gradients, I think</p>
<p>is number one that goes back, you know, 150 years.</p>
<p>And then Nesterov, I think has made a major contribution with this idea.</p>
<p>So like you said, gradients themselves are in some sense, mysterious.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not as trivial as&hellip;</p>
<p>Not as trivial.</p>
<p>Coordinate descent is more of a trivial one.</p>
<p>You just pick one of the coordinates.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we think.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how our human mind thinks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how our human minds think.</p>
<p>And gradients are not that easy for our human mind to grapple with.</p>
<p>An absurd question, but what is statistics?</p>
<p>So here it&rsquo;s a little bit, it&rsquo;s somewhere between math and science and technology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s somewhere in that convex hole.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a set of principles that allow you to make inferences that have got some reason</p>
<p>to be believed and also principles that allow you to make decisions where you can have some</p>
<p>reason to believe you&rsquo;re not going to make errors.</p>
<p>So all of that requires some assumptions about what do you mean by an error?</p>
<p>What do you mean by the probabilities?</p>
<p>But after you start making some of those assumptions, you&rsquo;re led to conclusions that, yes, I can</p>
<p>guarantee that if you do this in this way, your probability of making an error will be</p>
<p>small.</p>
<p>Your probability of continuing to not make errors over time will be small.</p>
<p>And the probability that you found something that&rsquo;s real will be small, will be high.</p>
<p>So decision making is a big part of that.</p>
<p>Decision making is a big part.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So statistics, short history was that, it goes back as a formal discipline, 250 years</p>
<p>or so.</p>
<p>It was called inverse probability because around that era, probability was developed</p>
<p>sort of especially to explain gambling situations.</p>
<p>Of course, interesting.</p>
<p>So you would say, well, given the state of nature is this, there&rsquo;s a certain roulette</p>
<p>board that has a certain mechanism and what kind of outcomes do I expect to see?</p>
<p>And especially if I do things long amounts of time, what outcomes will I see?</p>
<p>And the physicists started to pay attention to this.</p>
<p>And then people said, well, let&rsquo;s turn the problem around.</p>
<p>What if I saw certain outcomes, could I infer what the underlying mechanism was?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an inverse problem.</p>
<p>And in fact, for quite a while, statistics was called inverse probability.</p>
<p>That was the name of the field.</p>
<p>And I believe that it was Laplace who was working in Napoleon&rsquo;s government who needed</p>
<p>to do a census of France, learn about the people there.</p>
<p>So he went and gathered data and he analyzed that data to determine policy and said, well,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call this field that does this kind of thing statistics because the word state</p>
<p>is in there.</p>
<p>In French, that&rsquo;s etat, but it&rsquo;s the study of data for the state.</p>
<p>So anyway, that caught on and it&rsquo;s been called statistics ever since.</p>
<p>But by the time it got formalized, it was sort of in the 30s.</p>
<p>And around that time, there was game theory and decision theory developed nearby.</p>
<p>People in that era didn&rsquo;t think of themselves as either computer science or statistics or</p>
<p>control or econ.</p>
<p>They were all the above.</p>
<p>And so Von Neumann is developing game theory, but also thinking of that as decision theory.</p>
<p>Wald is an econometrician developing decision theory and then turning that into statistics.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s all about, here&rsquo;s not just data and you analyze it, here&rsquo;s a loss function.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you care about.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the question you&rsquo;re trying to ask.</p>
<p>Here is a probability model and here&rsquo;s the risk you will face if you make certain decisions.</p>
<p>And to this day, in most advanced statistical curricula, you teach decision theory as the</p>
<p>starting point and then it branches out into the two branches of Bayesian and frequentist.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s all about decisions.</p>
<p>In statistics, what is the most beautiful, mysterious, maybe surprising idea that you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>come across?</p>
<p>Yeah, good question.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a bunch of surprising ones.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s way too technical for this thing, but something called James</p>
<p>Stein estimation, which is kind of surprising and really takes time to wrap your head around.</p>
<p>Can you try to maybe&hellip;</p>
<p>I think I don&rsquo;t want to even want to try.</p>
<p>Let me just say a colleague at Steven Stigler at University of Chicago wrote a really beautiful</p>
<p>paper on James Stein estimation, which helps to&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s views a paradox.</p>
<p>It kind of defeats the mind&rsquo;s attempts to understand it, but you can and Steve has a</p>
<p>nice perspective on that.</p>
<p>So one of the troubles with statistics is that it&rsquo;s like in physics that are in quantum</p>
<p>physics, you have multiple interpretations.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a wave and particle duality in physics and you get used to that over time, but it</p>
<p>still kind of haunts you that you don&rsquo;t really quite understand the relationship.</p>
<p>The electron&rsquo;s a wave and electron&rsquo;s a particle.</p>
<p>Well the same thing happens here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Bayesian ways of thinking and frequentist, and they are different.</p>
<p>They sometimes become sort of the same in practice, but they are physically different.</p>
<p>And then in some practice, they are not the same at all.</p>
<p>They give you rather different answers.</p>
<p>And so it is very much like wave and particle duality, and that is something that you have</p>
<p>to kind of get used to in the field.</p>
<p>Can you define Bayesian and frequentist?</p>
<p>Yeah in decision theory you can make, I have a video that people could see.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called are you a Bayesian or a frequentist and kind of help try to make it really clear.</p>
<p>It comes from decision theory.</p>
<p>So you know, decision theory, you&rsquo;re talking about loss functions, which are a function</p>
<p>of data X and parameter theta.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a function of two arguments.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Neither one of those arguments is known.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know the data a priori.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s random and the parameters unknown.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So you have a function of two things you don&rsquo;t know, and you&rsquo;re trying to say, I want that</p>
<p>function to be small.</p>
<p>I want small loss, right?</p>
<p>Well what are you going to do?</p>
<p>So you sort of say, well, I&rsquo;m going to average over these quantities or maximize over them</p>
<p>or something so that, you know, I turn that uncertainty into something certain.</p>
<p>So you could look at the first argument and average over it, or you could look at the</p>
<p>second argument and average over it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Bayesian and frequentist.</p>
<p>So the frequentist says, I&rsquo;m going to look at the X, the data, and I&rsquo;m going to take</p>
<p>that as random and I&rsquo;m going to average over the distribution.</p>
<p>So I take the expectation loss under X. Theta is held fixed, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called the risk.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s looking at other, all the data sets you could get, right?</p>
<p>And say, how well will a certain procedure do under all those data sets?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called a frequentist guarantee, right?</p>
<p>So I think it is very appropriate when like you&rsquo;re building a piece of software and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>shipping it out there and people are using it on all kinds of data sets.</p>
<p>You want to have a stamp, a guarantee on it that as people run it on many, many data sets</p>
<p>that you never even thought about that 95% of the time it will do the right thing.</p>
<p>Perfectly reasonable.</p>
<p>The Bayesian perspective says, well, no, I&rsquo;m going to look at the other argument of the</p>
<p>loss function, the theta part, okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s unknown and I&rsquo;m uncertain about it.</p>
<p>So I could have my own personal probability for what it is, you know, how many tall people</p>
<p>are there out there?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to infer the average height of the population while I have an idea roughly</p>
<p>what the height is.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to average over the theta.</p>
<p>So now that loss function as only now, again, one argument&rsquo;s gone, now it&rsquo;s a function of</p>
<p>X and that&rsquo;s what a Bayesian does is they say, well, let&rsquo;s just focus on the particular</p>
<p>X we got, the data set we got, we condition on that.</p>
<p>Conditional on the X, I say something about my loss.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a Bayesian approach to things.</p>
<p>And the Bayesian will argue that it&rsquo;s not relevant to look at all the other data sets</p>
<p>you could have gotten and average over them, the frequentist approach.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really only the data sets you got, right?</p>
<p>And I do agree with that, especially in situations where you&rsquo;re working with a scientist, you</p>
<p>can learn a lot about the domain and you&rsquo;re really only focused on certain kinds of data</p>
<p>and you gathered your data and you make inferences.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with it though, that, you know, in the sense that there are needs for frequentist</p>
<p>guarantees, you&rsquo;re writing software, people are using it out there, you want to say something.</p>
<p>So these two things have to got to fight each other a little bit, but they have to blend.</p>
<p>So long story short, there&rsquo;s a set of ideas that are right in the middle that are called</p>
<p>empirical Bayes.</p>
<p>And empirical Bayes sort of starts with the Bayesian framework.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of arguably philosophically more, you know, reasonable and kosher.</p>
<p>Write down a bunch of the math that kind of flows from that, and then realize there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a bunch of things you don&rsquo;t know because it&rsquo;s the real world and you don&rsquo;t know everything.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re uncertain about certain quantities.</p>
<p>At that point, ask, is there a reasonable way to plug in an estimate for those things?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And in some cases, there&rsquo;s quite a reasonable thing to do, to plug in, there&rsquo;s a natural</p>
<p>thing you can observe in the world that you can plug in and then do a little bit more</p>
<p>mathematics and assure yourself it&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>So based on math or based on human expertise, what&rsquo;s, what, what are good?</p>
<p>Oh, they&rsquo;re both going in.</p>
<p>The Bayesian framework allows you to put a lot of human expertise in, but the math kind</p>
<p>of guides you along that path and then kind of reassures you the end, you could put that</p>
<p>stamp of approval under certain assumptions, this thing will work.</p>
<p>So you asked the question, what&rsquo;s my favorite, you know, or what&rsquo;s the most surprising, nice</p>
<p>idea.</p>
<p>So one that is more accessible is something called false discovery rate, which is, you</p>
<p>know, you&rsquo;re making not just one hypothesis test or making one decision, you&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>a whole bag of them.</p>
<p>And in that bag of decisions, you look at the ones where you made a discovery, you announced</p>
<p>that something interesting had happened.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be some subset of your big bag.</p>
<p>In the ones you made a discovery, which subset of those are bad?</p>
<p>Or false, false discoveries.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d like the fraction of your false discoveries among your discoveries to be small.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a different criterion than accuracy or precision or recall or sensitivity and</p>
<p>specificity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different quantity.</p>
<p>Those latter ones are almost all of them have more of a frequentist flavor.</p>
<p>They say, given the truth is that the null hypothesis is true.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what accuracy I would get, or given that the alternative is true, here&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>I would get.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of going forward from the state of nature to the data.</p>
<p>The Bayesian goes the other direction from the data back to the state of nature.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually what false discovery rate is.</p>
<p>It says, given you made a discovery, okay, that&rsquo;s conditioned on your data.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the probability of the hypothesis?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going the other direction.</p>
<p>And so the classical frequency look at that, well, I can&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s some priors</p>
<p>needed in that.</p>
<p>And the empirical Bayesian goes ahead and plows forward and starts writing down these formulas</p>
<p>and realizes at some point, some of those things can actually be estimated in a reasonable</p>
<p>way.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s kind of, it&rsquo;s a beautiful set of ideas.</p>
<p>So I, this kind of line of argument has come out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not certainly mine, but it sort of came out from Robbins around 1960.</p>
<p>Brad Efron has written beautifully about this in various papers and books.</p>
<p>And the FDR is, you know, Benjamin in Israel, John Story did this Bayesian interpretation</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>And he used to absorb these things over the years and find it a very healthy way to think</p>
<p>about statistics.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about intelligence to jump slightly back out into philosophy, perhaps.</p>
<p>You said that maybe you can elaborate, but you said that defining just even the question</p>
<p>of what is intelligence is a very difficult question.</p>
<p>Is it a useful question?</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll one day understand the fundamentals of human intelligence and what</p>
<p>it means, you know, have good benchmarks for general intelligence that we put before our</p>
<p>machines?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t work on these topics so much that you&rsquo;re really asking the question for a psychologist</p>
<p>really.</p>
<p>And I studied some, but I don&rsquo;t consider myself at least an expert at this point.</p>
<p>You know, a psychologist aims to understand human intelligence, right?</p>
<p>And I think many psychologists I know are fairly humble about this.</p>
<p>They might try to understand how a baby understands, you know, whether something&rsquo;s a solid or liquid</p>
<p>or whether something&rsquo;s hidden or not.</p>
<p>And maybe how a child starts to learn the meaning of certain words, what&rsquo;s a verb, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a noun and also, you know, slowly but surely trying to figure out things.</p>
<p>But humans ability to take a really complicated environment, reason about it, abstract about</p>
<p>it, find the right abstractions, communicate about it, interact and so on is just, you</p>
<p>know, really staggeringly rich and complicated.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I think in all humility, we don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re kind of aiming for that</p>
<p>in the near future.</p>
<p>A certain psychologist doing experiments with babies in the lab or with people talking has</p>
<p>a much more limited aspiration.</p>
<p>And you know, Kahneman and Tversky would look at our reasoning patterns and they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>deeply understanding all the how we do our reasoning, but they&rsquo;re sort of saying, hey,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s some oddities about the reasoning and some things you should think about it.</p>
<p>But also, as I emphasize in some things I&rsquo;ve been writing about, you know, AI, the revolution</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t happened yet.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Great blog post.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been emphasizing that, you know, if you step back and look at intelligent systems</p>
<p>of any kind and whatever you mean by intelligence, it&rsquo;s not just the humans or the animals or,</p>
<p>you know, the plants or whatever, you know, so a market that brings goods into a city,</p>
<p>you know, food to restaurants or something every day is a system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a decentralized set of decisions.</p>
<p>Looking at it from far enough away, it&rsquo;s just like a collection of neurons.</p>
<p>Every neuron is making its own little decisions, presumably in some way.</p>
<p>And if you step back enough, every little part of an economic system is making all of</p>
<p>its decisions.</p>
<p>And just like with the brain, who knows what an individual neuron does and what the overall</p>
<p>goal is, right?</p>
<p>But something happens at some aggregate level, same thing with the economy.</p>
<p>People eat in a city and it&rsquo;s robust.</p>
<p>It works at all scales, small villages to big cities.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been working for thousands of years.</p>
<p>It works rain or shine, so it&rsquo;s adaptive.</p>
<p>So all the kind of, you know, those are adjectives one tends to apply to intelligent systems.</p>
<p>Robust, adaptive, you know, you don&rsquo;t need to keep adjusting it, self healing, whatever.</p>
<p>Plus not perfect.</p>
<p>You know, intelligences are never perfect and markets are not perfect.</p>
<p>But I do not believe in this era that you cannot, that you can say, well, our computers</p>
<p>are, our humans are smart, but you know, no markets are not, more markets are.</p>
<p>So they are intelligent.</p>
<p>Now we humans didn&rsquo;t evolve to be markets.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been participating in them, right?</p>
<p>But we are not ourselves a market per se.</p>
<p>The neurons could be viewed as the market.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s economic, you know, neuroscience kind of perspective.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting to pursue all that.</p>
<p>The point though is, is that if you were to study humans and really be the world&rsquo;s best</p>
<p>psychologist studied for thousands of years and come up with the theory of human intelligence,</p>
<p>you might have never discovered principles of markets, you know, supply demand curves</p>
<p>and you know, matching and auctions and all that.</p>
<p>Those are real principles and they lead to a form of intelligence that&rsquo;s not maybe human</p>
<p>intelligence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s arguably another kind of intelligence.</p>
<p>There probably are third kinds of intelligence or fourth that none of us are really thinking</p>
<p>too much about right now.</p>
<p>So if you really, and then all of those are relevant to computer systems in the future.</p>
<p>Certainly the market one is relevant right now.</p>
<p>Whereas the understanding of human intelligence is not so clear that it&rsquo;s relevant right now.</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>So if you want general intelligence, whatever one means by that, or, you know, understanding</p>
<p>intelligence in a deep sense and all that, it is definitely has to be not just human</p>
<p>intelligence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotta be this broader thing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not a mystery.</p>
<p>Markets are intelligent.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s definitely not just a philosophical stance to say we&rsquo;ve got to move beyond intelligence.</p>
<p>That sounds ridiculous.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>And in that blog post, you define different kinds of like intelligent infrastructure,</p>
<p>AI, which I really like is some of the concepts you&rsquo;ve just been describing.</p>
<p>Do you see ourselves, if we see earth, human civilization as a single organism, do you</p>
<p>think the intelligence of that organism, when you think from the perspective of markets</p>
<p>and intelligence infrastructure is increasing, is it increasing linearly?</p>
<p>Is it increasing exponentially?</p>
<p>What do you think the future of that intelligence?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t tend to think, I don&rsquo;t tend to answer questions like that because you know, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>science fiction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping to catch you off guard.</p>
<p>Well again, because you said it&rsquo;s so far in the future, it&rsquo;s fun to ask and you&rsquo;ll probably,</p>
<p>you know, like you said, predicting the future is really nearly impossible.</p>
<p>But say as an axiom, one day we create a human level, a superhuman level intelligent, not</p>
<p>the scale of markets, but the scale of an individual.</p>
<p>What do you think it is, what do you think it would take to do that?</p>
<p>Or maybe to ask another question is how would that system be different than the biological</p>
<p>human beings that we see around us today?</p>
<p>Is it possible to say anything interesting to that question or is it just a stupid question?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a stupid question, but it&rsquo;s science fiction.</p>
<p>Science fiction.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m totally happy to read science fiction and think about it from time in my own life.</p>
<p>I loved, there was this like brain in a vat kind of, you know, little thing that people</p>
<p>were talking about when I was a student, I remember, you know, imagine that, you know,</p>
<p>between your brain and your body, there&rsquo;s a, you know, there&rsquo;s a bunch of wires, right?</p>
<p>And suppose that every one of them was replaced with a literal wire.</p>
<p>And then suppose that wire was turned in actually a little wireless, you know, there&rsquo;s a receiver</p>
<p>and sender.</p>
<p>So the brain has got all the senders and receiver, you know, on all of its exiting, you know,</p>
<p>axons and all the dendrites down to the body have replaced with senders and receivers.</p>
<p>Now you could move the body off somewhere and put the brain in a vat, right?</p>
<p>And then you could do things like start killing off those senders and receivers one by one.</p>
<p>And after you&rsquo;ve killed off all of them, where is that person?</p>
<p>You know, they thought they were out in the body walking around the world and they moved</p>
<p>on.</p>
<p>So those are science fiction things.</p>
<p>Those are fun to think about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just intriguing about where is, what is thought, where is it and all that.</p>
<p>And I think every 18 year old should take philosophy classes and think about these things.</p>
<p>And I think that everyone should think about what could happen in society that&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>bad and all that.</p>
<p>But I really don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the right thing for most of us that are my age group</p>
<p>to be doing and thinking about.</p>
<p>I really think that we have so many more present, you know, first challenges and dangers and</p>
<p>real things to build and all that such that, you know, spending too much time on science</p>
<p>fiction, at least in public for like this, I think is not what we should be doing.</p>
<p>Maybe over beers in private.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not going to broadcast where I have beers because this is going to go on Facebook</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t want a lot of people showing up there.</p>
<p>But yeah, I&rsquo;ll, I love Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, YouTube.</p>
<p>I have I&rsquo;m optimistic and hopeful, but maybe, maybe I don&rsquo;t have grounds for such optimism</p>
<p>and hope.</p>
<p>But let me ask, you&rsquo;ve mentored some of the brightest sort of some of the seminal figures</p>
<p>in the field.</p>
<p>Can you give advice to people who are undergraduates today?</p>
<p>What does it take to take, you know, advice on their journey if they&rsquo;re interested in</p>
<p>machine learning and in the ideas of markets from economics and psychology and all the</p>
<p>kinds of things that you&rsquo;ve exploring?</p>
<p>What steps should they take on that journey?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, first of all, the door is open and second, it&rsquo;s a journey.</p>
<p>I like your language there.</p>
<p>It is not that you&rsquo;re so brilliant and you have great, brilliant ideas and therefore</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just, you know, that&rsquo;s how you have success or that&rsquo;s how you enter into the field.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that you apprentice yourself, you spend a lot of time, you work on hard things, you</p>
<p>try and pull back and you be as broad as you can, you talk to lots of people.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like entering in any kind of a creative community.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s years that are needed and human connections are critical to it.</p>
<p>So, you know, I think about, you know, being a musician or being an artist or something,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t just, you know, immediately from day one, you know, you&rsquo;re a genius and therefore</p>
<p>you do it.</p>
<p>No, you, you know, practice really, really hard on basics and you be humble about where</p>
<p>you are and then, and you realize you&rsquo;ll never be an expert on everything.</p>
<p>So you kind of pick and there&rsquo;s a lot of randomness and a lot of kind of luck, but luck just kind</p>
<p>of picks out which branch of the tree you go down, but you&rsquo;ll go down some branch.</p>
<p>So yeah, it&rsquo;s a community.</p>
<p>So the graduate school is, I still think is one of the wonderful phenomena that we have</p>
<p>in our, in our world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very much about apprenticeship with an advisor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very much about a group of people you belong to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a four or five year process.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s plenty of time to start from kind of nothing to come up to something, you know,</p>
<p>more, more expertise, and then to start to have your own creativity start to flower,</p>
<p>even surprising your own self.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very cooperative endeavor.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people think of science as highly competitive and I think in some other</p>
<p>fields it might be more so.</p>
<p>Here it&rsquo;s way more cooperative than you might imagine.</p>
<p>And people are always teaching each other something and people are always more than</p>
<p>happy to be clear that, so I feel I&rsquo;m an expert on certain kinds of things, but I&rsquo;m very much</p>
<p>not expert on lots of other things and a lot of them are relevant and a lot of them are,</p>
<p>I should know, but should in some society, you know, you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m always willing to reveal my ignorance to people around me so they can teach me things.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of us feel that way about our field.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very cooperative.</p>
<p>I might add it&rsquo;s also very international because it&rsquo;s so cooperative.</p>
<p>We see no barriers.</p>
<p>And so that the nationalism that you see, especially in the current era and everything</p>
<p>is just at odds with the way that most of us think about what we&rsquo;re doing here, where</p>
<p>this is a human endeavor and we cooperate and are very much trying to do it together</p>
<p>for the, you know, the benefit of everybody.</p>
<p>So last question, where and how and why did you learn French and which language is more</p>
<p>beautiful English or French?</p>
<p>Great question.</p>
<p>So first of all, I think Italian is actually more beautiful than French and English.</p>
<p>And I also speak that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m married to an Italian and I have kids and we speak Italian.</p>
<p>Anyway, all kidding aside, every language allows you to express things a bit differently.</p>
<p>And it is one of the great fun things to do in life is to explore those things.</p>
<p>So in fact, when I kids or teens or college students ask me what they study, I say, well,</p>
<p>do what your heart, where your heart is, certainly do a lot of math.</p>
<p>Math is good for everybody, but do some poetry and do some history and do some language too.</p>
<p>You know, throughout your life, you&rsquo;ll want to be a thinking person.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll want to have done that.</p>
<p>For me, French I learned when I was, I&rsquo;d say a late teen, I was living in the middle of</p>
<p>the country in Kansas and not much was going on in Kansas with all due respect to Kansas.</p>
<p>And so my parents happened to have some French books on the shelf and just in my boredom,</p>
<p>I pulled them down and I found this is fun.</p>
<p>And I kind of learned the language by reading.</p>
<p>And when I first heard it spoken, I had no idea what was being spoken, but I realized</p>
<p>I had somehow knew it from some previous life and so I made the connection.</p>
<p>But then I traveled and just I love to go beyond my own barriers and my own comfort</p>
<p>or whatever.</p>
<p>And I found myself on trains in France next to say older people who had lived a whole</p>
<p>life of their own.</p>
<p>And the ability to communicate with them was special and the ability to also see myself</p>
<p>in other people&rsquo;s shoes and have empathy and kind of work on that language as part of that.</p>
<p>So after that kind of experience and also embedding myself in French culture, which</p>
<p>is quite amazing, languages are rich, not just because there&rsquo;s something inherently</p>
<p>beautiful about it, but it&rsquo;s all the creativity that went into it.</p>
<p>So I learned a lot of songs, read poems, read books.</p>
<p>And then I was here actually at MIT where we&rsquo;re doing the podcast today and a young</p>
<p>professor not yet married and not having a lot of friends in the area.</p>
<p>So I just didn&rsquo;t have, I was kind of a bored person.</p>
<p>I said, I heard a lot of Italians around.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s happened to be a lot of Italians at MIT, an Italian professor for some reason.</p>
<p>And so I was kind of vaguely understanding what they were talking about.</p>
<p>I said, well, I should learn this language too.</p>
<p>So I did.</p>
<p>And then later met my spouse and Italian became a part of my life.</p>
<p>But I go to China a lot these days.</p>
<p>I go to Asia, I go to Europe and every time I go, I kind of am amazed by the richness</p>
<p>of human experience and the people don&rsquo;t have any idea if you haven&rsquo;t traveled, kind of</p>
<p>how amazingly rich and I love the diversity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a buzzword to me.</p>
<p>It really means something.</p>
<p>I love to embed myself with other people&rsquo;s experiences.</p>
<p>And so yeah, learning language is a big part of that.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve said in some interview at some point that if I had millions of dollars and</p>
<p>infinite time or whatever, what would you really work on if you really wanted to do</p>
<p>AI?</p>
<p>And for me, that is natural language and really done right.</p>
<p>Deep understanding of language.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s to me, an amazingly interesting scientific challenge.</p>
<p>One we&rsquo;re very far away on.</p>
<p>One we&rsquo;re very far away, but good natural language.</p>
<p>People are kind of really invested then.</p>
<p>I think a lot of them see that&rsquo;s where the core of AI is that if you understand that</p>
<p>you really help human communication, you understand something about the human mind, the semantics</p>
<p>that come out of the human mind and I agree, I think that will be such a long time.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t do that in my career just cause I kind of, I was behind in the early days.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t kind of know enough of that stuff.</p>
<p>I was at MIT, I didn&rsquo;t learn much language and it was too late at some point to kind</p>
<p>of spend a whole career doing that, but I admire that field and so in my little way</p>
<p>by learning language, you know, kind of that part of my brain has been trained up.</p>
<p>Jan was right.</p>
<p>You truly are the Miles Davis of machine learning.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better place than it.</p>
<p>Mike it was a huge honor talking to you today.</p>

<p>And now let me leave you with some words of wisdom from Michael I. Jordan from his blog</p>
<p>post titled Artificial Intelligence, the revolution hasn&rsquo;t happened yet, calling for broadening</p>
<p>the scope of the AI field.</p>
<p>We should embrace the fact that what we are witnessing is the creation of a new branch</p>
<p>of engineering.</p>
<p>The term engineering is often invoked in a narrow sense in academia and beyond with overtones</p>
<p>of cold, effectless machinery and negative connotations of loss of control by humans.</p>
<p>But an engineering discipline can be what we want it to be.</p>
<p>In the current era, we have a real opportunity to conceive of something historically new,</p>
<p>a human centric engineering discipline.</p>
<p>I will resist giving this emerging discipline a name, but if the acronym AI continues to</p>
<p>be used, let&rsquo;s be aware of the very real limitations of this placeholder.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s broaden our scope, tone down the hype, and recognize the serious challenges ahead.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
