    <p>What difference between biological neural networks and artificial neural networks</p>
<p>is most mysterious, captivating, and profound for you?</p>
<p>First of all, there&rsquo;s so much we don&rsquo;t know about biological neural networks,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s very mysterious and captivating because maybe it holds the key to improving</p>
<p>artificial neural networks. One of the things I studied recently is something</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t know how biological neural networks do but would be really useful for artificial ones</p>
<p>is the ability to do credit assignment through very long time spans. There are things that</p>
<p>we can in principle do with artificial neural nets, but it&rsquo;s not very convenient and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not biologically plausible. And this mismatch, I think this kind of mismatch</p>
<p>may be an interesting thing to study to, A, understand better how brains might do these</p>
<p>things because we don&rsquo;t have good corresponding theories with artificial neural nets, and B,</p>
<p>maybe provide new ideas that we could explore about things that brain do differently and that</p>
<p>we could incorporate in artificial neural nets. So let&rsquo;s break credit assignment up a little bit.</p>
<p>Yes. So what, it&rsquo;s a beautifully technical term, but it could incorporate so many things. So is it</p>
<p>more on the RNN memory side, that thinking like that, or is it something about knowledge, building</p>
<p>up common sense knowledge over time? Or is it more in the reinforcement learning sense that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>picking up rewards over time for a particular, to achieve a certain kind of goal? So I was thinking</p>
<p>more about the first two meanings whereby we store all kinds of memories, episodic memories</p>
<p>in our brain, which we can access later in order to help us both infer causes of things that we</p>
<p>are observing now and assign credit to decisions or interpretations we came up with a while ago</p>
<p>when those memories were stored. And then we can change the way we would have reacted or interpreted</p>
<p>things in the past, and now that&rsquo;s credit assignment used for learning.</p>
<p>So in which way do you think artificial neural networks, the current LSTM, the current architectures</p>
<p>are not able to capture the, presumably you&rsquo;re thinking of very long term?</p>
<p>Yes. So current, the current nets are doing a fairly good jobs for sequences with dozens or</p>
<p>say hundreds of time steps. And then it gets harder and harder and depending on what you have</p>
<p>to remember and so on, as you consider longer durations. Whereas humans seem to be able to</p>
<p>do credit assignment through essentially arbitrary times, like I could remember something I did last</p>
<p>year. And then now because I see some new evidence, I&rsquo;m going to change my mind about the way I was</p>
<p>thinking last year. And hopefully not do the same mistake again.</p>
<p>I think a big part of that is probably forgetting. You&rsquo;re only remembering the really important</p>
<p>things. It&rsquo;s very efficient forgetting.</p>
<p>Yes. So there&rsquo;s a selection of what we remember. And I think there are really cool connection to</p>
<p>higher level cognition here regarding consciousness, deciding and emotions,</p>
<p>so deciding what comes to consciousness and what gets stored in memory, which are not trivial either.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve been at the forefront there all along, showing some of the amazing things that neural</p>
<p>networks, deep neural networks can do in the field of artificial intelligence is just broadly</p>
<p>in all kinds of applications. But we can talk about that forever. But what, in your view,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re thinking towards the future, is the weakest aspect of the way deep neural networks</p>
<p>represent the world? What is that? What is in your view is missing?</p>
<p>So current state of the art neural nets trained on large quantities of images or texts</p>
<p>have some level of understanding of, you know, what explains those data sets, but it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>basic, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s very low level. And it&rsquo;s not nearly as robust and abstract and general</p>
<p>as our understanding. Okay, so that doesn&rsquo;t tell us how to fix things. But I think it encourages</p>
<p>us to think about how we can maybe train our neural nets differently, so that they would</p>
<p>focus, for example, on causal explanation, something that we don&rsquo;t do currently with neural</p>
<p>net training. Also, one thing I&rsquo;ll talk about in my talk this afternoon is the fact that</p>
<p>instead of learning separately from images and videos on one hand and from texts on the other</p>
<p>hand, we need to do a better job of jointly learning about language and about the world</p>
<p>to which it refers. So that, you know, both sides can help each other. We need to have good world</p>
<p>models in our neural nets for them to really understand sentences, which talk about what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on in the world. And I think we need language input to help provide clues about</p>
<p>what high level concepts like semantic concepts should be represented at the top levels of our</p>
<p>neural nets. In fact, there is evidence that the purely unsupervised learning of representations</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t give rise to high level representations that are as powerful as the ones we&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>from supervised learning. And so the clues we&rsquo;re getting just with the labels, not even sentences,</p>
<p>is already very, very high level. And I think that&rsquo;s a very important thing to keep in mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already very powerful. Do you think that&rsquo;s an architecture challenge or is it a data set challenge?</p>
<p>Neither. I&rsquo;m tempted to just end it there. Can you elaborate slightly?</p>
<p>Of course, data sets and architectures are something you want to always play with. But</p>
<p>I think the crucial thing is more the training objectives, the training frameworks. For example,</p>
<p>going from passive observation of data to more active agents, which</p>
<p>learn by intervening in the world, the relationships between causes and effects,</p>
<p>the sort of objective functions, which could be important to allow the highest level explanations</p>
<p>to rise from the learning, which I don&rsquo;t think we have now, the kinds of objective functions,</p>
<p>which could be used to reward exploration, the right kind of exploration. So these kinds of</p>
<p>questions are neither in the data set nor in the architecture, but more in how we learn,</p>
<p>under what objectives and so on. Yeah, I&rsquo;ve heard you mention in several contexts, the idea of sort</p>
<p>of the way children learn, they interact with objects in the world. And it seems fascinating</p>
<p>because in some sense, except with some cases in reinforcement learning, that idea</p>
<p>is not part of the learning process in artificial neural networks. So it&rsquo;s almost like,</p>
<p>do you envision something like an objective function saying, you know what, if you</p>
<p>poke this object in this kind of way, it would be really helpful for me to further learn.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>Sort of almost guiding some aspect of the learning.</p>
<p>Right, right, right. So I was talking to Rebecca Sacks just a few minutes ago,</p>
<p>and she was talking about lots and lots of evidence from infants seem to clearly pick</p>
<p>what interests them in a directed way. And so they&rsquo;re not passive learners, they focus their</p>
<p>attention on aspects of the world, which are most interesting, surprising in a non trivial way.</p>
<p>That makes them change their theories of the world.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a fascinating view of the future progress. But on a more maybe boring question,</p>
<p>do you think going deeper and larger, so do you think just increasing the size of the things that</p>
<p>have been increasing a lot in the past few years, is going to be a big thing?</p>
<p>I think increasing the size of the things that have been increasing a lot in the past few years</p>
<p>will also make significant progress. So some of the representational issues that you mentioned,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re kind of shallow, in some sense.</p>
<p>Oh, shallow in the sense of abstraction.</p>
<p>In the sense of abstraction, they&rsquo;re not getting some&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that having more depth in the network in the sense of instead of 100 layers,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have more layers. I don&rsquo;t think so. Is that obvious to you?</p>
<p>Yes. What is clear to me is that engineers and companies and labs and grad students will continue</p>
<p>to tune architectures and explore all kinds of tweaks to make the current state of the art</p>
<p>slightly ever slightly better. But I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s going to be nearly enough. I think we need</p>
<p>changes in the way that we&rsquo;re considering learning to achieve the goal that these learners actually</p>
<p>understand in a deep way the environment in which they are, you know, observing and acting.</p>
<p>But I guess I was trying to ask a question that&rsquo;s more interesting than just more layers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically, once you figure out a way to learn through interacting, how many parameters</p>
<p>it takes to store that information. So I think our brain is quite bigger than most neural networks.</p>
<p>Right, right. Oh, I see what you mean. Oh, I&rsquo;m with you there. So I agree that in order to</p>
<p>build neural nets with the kind of broad knowledge of the world that typical adult humans have,</p>
<p>probably the kind of computing power we have now is going to be insufficient.</p>
<p>So the good news is there are hardware companies building neural net chips. And so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to get better. However, the good news in a way, which is also a bad news,</p>
<p>is that even our state of the art, deep learning methods fail to learn models that understand</p>
<p>even very simple environments, like some grid worlds that we have built.</p>
<p>Even these fairly simple environments, I mean, of course, if you train them with enough examples,</p>
<p>eventually they get it. But it&rsquo;s just like, instead of what humans might need just</p>
<p>dozens of examples, these things will need millions for very, very, very simple tasks.</p>
<p>And so I think there&rsquo;s an opportunity for academics who don&rsquo;t have the kind of computing</p>
<p>power that, say, Google has to do really important and exciting research to advance</p>
<p>the state of the art in training frameworks, learning models, agent learning in even simple</p>
<p>environments that are synthetic, that seem trivial, but yet current machine learning fails on.</p>
<p>We talked about priors and common sense knowledge. It seems like</p>
<p>we humans take a lot of knowledge for granted. So what&rsquo;s your view of these priors of forming</p>
<p>this broad view of the world, this accumulation of information and how we can teach neural networks</p>
<p>or learning systems to pick that knowledge up? So knowledge, for a while, the artificial</p>
<p>intelligence was maybe in the 80s, like there&rsquo;s a time where knowledge representation, knowledge,</p>
<p>acquisition, expert systems, I mean, the symbolic AI was a view, was an interesting problem set to</p>
<p>solve and it was kind of put on hold a little bit, it seems like. Because it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t work. That&rsquo;s right. But that&rsquo;s right. But the goals of that remain important.</p>
<p>Yes. Remain important. And how do you think those goals can be addressed?</p>
<p>Right. So first of all, I believe that one reason why the classical expert systems approach failed</p>
<p>is because a lot of the knowledge we have, so you talked about common sense intuition,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of knowledge like this, which is not consciously accessible.</p>
<p>There are lots of decisions we&rsquo;re taking that we can&rsquo;t really explain, even if sometimes we make</p>
<p>up a story. And that knowledge is also necessary for machines to take good decisions. And that</p>
<p>knowledge is hard to codify in expert systems, rule based systems and classical AI formalism.</p>
<p>And there are other issues, of course, with the old AI, like not really good ways of handling</p>
<p>uncertainty, I would say something more subtle, which we understand better now, but I think still</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t enough in the minds of people. There&rsquo;s something really powerful that comes from</p>
<p>distributed representations, the thing that really makes neural nets work so well.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to replicate that kind of power in a symbolic world. The knowledge in expert systems</p>
<p>and so on is nicely decomposed into like a bunch of rules. Whereas if you think about a neural net,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the opposite. You have this big blob of parameters which work intensely together to</p>
<p>represent everything the network knows. And it&rsquo;s not sufficiently factorized. It&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>sufficiently factorized. And so I think this is one of the weaknesses of current neural nets,</p>
<p>that we have to take lessons from classical AI in order to bring in another kind of compositionality,</p>
<p>which is common in language, for example, and in these rules, but that isn&rsquo;t so native to neural</p>
<p>nets. And on that line of thinking, disentangled representations. Yes. So let me connect with</p>
<p>disentangled representations, if you might, if you don&rsquo;t mind. So for many years, I&rsquo;ve thought,</p>
<p>and I still believe that it&rsquo;s really important that we come up with learning algorithms,</p>
<p>either unsupervised or supervised, but reinforcement, whatever, that build representations</p>
<p>in which the important factors, hopefully causal factors are nicely separated and easy to pick up</p>
<p>from the representation. So that&rsquo;s the idea of disentangled representations. It says transform</p>
<p>the data into a space where everything becomes easy. We can maybe just learn with linear models</p>
<p>about the things we care about. And I still think this is important, but I think this is missing out</p>
<p>on a very important ingredient, which classical AI systems can remind us of.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say we have these disentangled representations. You still need to learn about</p>
<p>the relationships between the variables, those high level semantic variables. They&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to be independent. I mean, this is like too much of an assumption. They&rsquo;re going to have some</p>
<p>interesting relationships that allow to predict things in the future, to explain what happened</p>
<p>in the past. The kind of knowledge about those relationships in a classical AI system</p>
<p>is encoded in the rules. Like a rule is just like a little piece of knowledge that says,</p>
<p>oh, I have these two, three, four variables that are linked in this interesting way,</p>
<p>then I can say something about one or two of them given a couple of others, right?</p>
<p>In addition to disentangling the elements of the representation, which are like the variables</p>
<p>in a rule based system, you also need to disentangle the mechanisms that relate those</p>
<p>variables to each other. So like the rules. So the rules are neatly separated. Like each rule is,</p>
<p>you know, living on its own. And when I change a rule because I&rsquo;m learning, it doesn&rsquo;t need to</p>
<p>break other rules. Whereas current neural nets, for example, are very sensitive to what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>catastrophic forgetting, where after I&rsquo;ve learned some things and then I learn new things,</p>
<p>they can destroy the old things that I had learned, right? If the knowledge was better</p>
<p>factorized and separated, disentangled, then you would avoid a lot of that.</p>
<p>Now, you can&rsquo;t do this in the sensory domain.</p>
<p>What do you mean by sensory domain?</p>
<p>Like in pixel space. But my idea is that when you project the data in the right semantic space,</p>
<p>it becomes possible to now represent this extra knowledge beyond the transformation from inputs</p>
<p>to representations, which is how representations act on each other and predict the future and so on</p>
<p>in a way that can be neatly disentangled. So now it&rsquo;s the rules that are disentangled from each</p>
<p>other and not just the variables that are disentangled from each other.</p>
<p>And you draw a distinction between semantic space and pixel, like does there need to be</p>
<p>an architectural difference?</p>
<p>Well, yeah. So there&rsquo;s the sensory space like pixels, which where everything is entangled.</p>
<p>The information, like the variables are completely interdependent in very complicated ways.</p>
<p>And also computation, like it&rsquo;s not just the variables, it&rsquo;s also how they are related to</p>
<p>each other is all intertwined. But I&rsquo;m hypothesizing that in the right high level</p>
<p>representation space, both the variables and how they relate to each other can be</p>
<p>disentangled. And that will provide a lot of generalization power.</p>
<p>Generalization power.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Distribution of the test set is assumed to be the same as the distribution of the training set.</p>
<p>Right. This is where current machine learning is too weak. It doesn&rsquo;t tell us anything,</p>
<p>is not able to tell us anything about how our neural nets, say, are going to generalize to</p>
<p>a new distribution. And, you know, people may think, well, but there&rsquo;s nothing we can say</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t know what the new distribution will be. The truth is humans are able to generalize</p>
<p>to new distributions.</p>
<p>Yeah. How are we able to do that?</p>
<p>Yeah. Because there is something, these new distributions, even though they could look</p>
<p>very different from the training distributions, they have things in common. So let me give you</p>
<p>a concrete example. You read a science fiction novel. The science fiction novel, maybe, you</p>
<p>know, brings you in some other planet where things look very different on the surface,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still the same laws of physics. And so you can read the book and you understand</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on. So the distribution is very different. But because you can transport</p>
<p>a lot of the knowledge you had from Earth about the underlying cause and effect relationships</p>
<p>and physical mechanisms and all that, and maybe even social interactions, you can now</p>
<p>make sense of what is going on on this planet where, like, visually, for example,</p>
<p>things are totally different.</p>
<p>Taking that analogy further and distorting it, let&rsquo;s enter a science fiction world of,</p>
<p>say, Space Odyssey, 2001, with Hal. Or maybe, which is probably one of my favorite AI movies.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s another one that a lot of people love that may be a little bit outside</p>
<p>of the AI community is Ex Machina. I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve seen it.</p>
<p>Yes. Yes.</p>
<p>By the way, what are your views on that movie? Are you able to enjoy it?</p>
<p>Are there things I like and things I hate?</p>
<p>So you could talk about that in the context of a question I want to ask, which is, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>quite a large community of people from different backgrounds, often outside of AI, who are concerned</p>
<p>about existential threat of artificial intelligence. You&rsquo;ve seen this community</p>
<p>develop over time. You&rsquo;ve seen you have a perspective. So what do you think is the best</p>
<p>way to talk about AI safety, to think about it, to have discourse about it within AI community</p>
<p>and outside and grounded in the fact that Ex Machina is one of the main sources of information</p>
<p>for the general public about AI?</p>
<p>So I think you&rsquo;re putting it right. There&rsquo;s a big difference between the sort of discussion</p>
<p>we ought to have within the AI community and the sort of discussion that really matter</p>
<p>in the general public. So I think the picture of Terminator and AI loose and killing people</p>
<p>and super intelligence that&rsquo;s going to destroy us, whatever we try, isn&rsquo;t really so useful</p>
<p>for the public discussion. Because for the public discussion, the things I believe really</p>
<p>matter are the short term and medium term, very likely negative impacts of AI on society,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s from security, like, you know, big brother scenarios with face recognition</p>
<p>or killer robots, or the impact on the job market, or concentration of power and discrimination,</p>
<p>all kinds of social issues, which could actually, some of them could really threaten democracy,</p>
<p>for example.</p>
<p>Just to clarify, when you said killer robots, you mean autonomous weapon, weapon systems.</p>
<p>Yes, I don&rsquo;t mean that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So I think these short and medium term concerns should be important parts of the public debate.</p>
<p>Now, existential risk, for me is a very unlikely consideration, but still worth academic investigation</p>
<p>in the same way that you could say, should we study what could happen if meteorite, you</p>
<p>know, came to earth and destroyed it. So I think it&rsquo;s very unlikely that this is going</p>
<p>to happen in or happen in a reasonable future. The sort of scenario of an AI getting loose</p>
<p>goes against my understanding of at least current machine learning and current neural</p>
<p>nets and so on. It&rsquo;s not plausible to me. But of course, I don&rsquo;t have a crystal ball</p>
<p>and who knows what AI will be in 50 years from now. So I think it is worth that scientists</p>
<p>study those problems. It&rsquo;s just not a pressing question as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.</p>
<p>So before I continue down that line, I have a few questions there. But what do you like</p>
<p>and not like about Ex Machina as a movie? Because I actually watched it for the second</p>
<p>time and enjoyed it. I hated it the first time, and I enjoyed it quite a bit more the</p>
<p>second time when I sort of learned to accept certain pieces of it, see it as a concept</p>
<p>movie. What was your experience? What were your thoughts?</p>
<p>So the negative is the picture it paints of science is totally wrong. Science in general</p>
<p>and AI in particular. Science is not happening in some hidden place by some, you know, really</p>
<p>smart guy, one person. This is totally unrealistic. This is not how it happens. Even a team of</p>
<p>people in some isolated place will not make it. Science moves by small steps, thanks to</p>
<p>the collaboration and community of a large number of people interacting. And all the</p>
<p>scientists who are expert in their field kind of know what is going on, even in the industrial</p>
<p>labs. It&rsquo;s information flows and leaks and so on. And the spirit of it is very different</p>
<p>from the way science is painted in this movie.</p>
<p>Yeah, let me ask on that point. It&rsquo;s been the case to this point that kind of even if</p>
<p>the research happens inside Google or Facebook, inside companies, it still kind of comes out,</p>
<p>ideas come out. Do you think that will always be the case with AI? Is it possible to bottle</p>
<p>ideas to the point where there&rsquo;s a set of breakthroughs that go completely undiscovered</p>
<p>by the general research community? Do you think that&rsquo;s even possible?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible, but it&rsquo;s unlikely. It&rsquo;s not how it is done now. It&rsquo;s not how I can foresee</p>
<p>it in the foreseeable future. But of course, I don&rsquo;t have a crystal ball and science is</p>
<p>a crystal ball. And so who knows? This is science fiction after all.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s ominous that the lights went off during that discussion.</p>
<p>So the problem, again, there&rsquo;s one thing is the movie and you could imagine all kinds</p>
<p>of science fiction. The problem for me, maybe similar to the question about existential</p>
<p>risk, is that this kind of movie paints such a wrong picture of what is the actual science</p>
<p>and how it&rsquo;s going on that it can have unfortunate effects on people&rsquo;s understanding of current</p>
<p>science. And so that&rsquo;s kind of sad.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an important principle in research, which is diversity. So in other words, research</p>
<p>is exploration. Research is exploration in the space of ideas. And different people will</p>
<p>focus on different directions. And this is not just good, it&rsquo;s essential. So I&rsquo;m totally</p>
<p>fine with people exploring directions that are contrary to mine or look orthogonal to</p>
<p>mine. I am more than fine. I think it&rsquo;s important. I and my friends don&rsquo;t claim we have universal</p>
<p>truth about what will, especially about what will happen in the future. Now that being</p>
<p>said, we have our intuitions and then we act accordingly according to where we think we</p>
<p>can be most useful and where society has the most to gain or to lose. We should have those</p>
<p>debates and not end up in a society where there&rsquo;s only one voice and one way of thinking</p>
<p>and research money is spread out.</p>
<p>So disagreement is a sign of good research, good science.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The idea of bias in the human sense of bias. How do you think about instilling in machine</p>
<p>learning something that&rsquo;s aligned with human values in terms of bias? We intuitively as</p>
<p>human beings have a concept of what bias means, of what fundamental respect for other human</p>
<p>beings means. But how do we instill that into machine learning systems, do you think?</p>
<p>So I think there are short term things that are already happening and then there are long</p>
<p>term things that we need to do. In the short term, there are techniques that have been</p>
<p>proposed and I think will continue to be improved and maybe alternatives will come up to take</p>
<p>data sets in which we know there is bias, we can measure it. Pretty much any data set</p>
<p>where humans are being observed taking decisions will have some sort of bias, discrimination</p>
<p>against particular groups and so on.</p>
<p>And we can use machine learning techniques to try to build predictors, classifiers that</p>
<p>are going to be less biased. We can do it, for example, using adversarial methods to</p>
<p>make our systems less sensitive to these variables we should not be sensitive to.</p>
<p>So these are clear, well defined ways of trying to address the problem. Maybe they have weaknesses</p>
<p>and more research is needed and so on. But I think in fact they are sufficiently mature</p>
<p>that governments should start regulating companies where it matters, say like insurance companies,</p>
<p>so that they use those techniques. Because those techniques will probably reduce the</p>
<p>bias but at a cost. For example, maybe their predictions will be less accurate and so companies</p>
<p>will not do it until you force them.</p>
<p>All right, so this is short term. Long term, I&rsquo;m really interested in thinking how we can</p>
<p>instill moral values into computers. Obviously, this is not something we&rsquo;ll achieve in the</p>
<p>next five or 10 years. How can we, you know, there&rsquo;s already work in detecting emotions,</p>
<p>for example, in images, in sounds, in texts, and also studying how different agents interacting</p>
<p>in different ways may correspond to patterns of, say, injustice, which could trigger anger.</p>
<p>So these are things we can do in the medium term and eventually train computers to model,</p>
<p>for example, how humans react emotionally. I would say the simplest thing is unfair situations</p>
<p>which trigger anger. This is one of the most basic emotions that we share with other animals.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s quite feasible within the next few years that we can build systems that can</p>
<p>detect these kinds of things to the extent, unfortunately, that they understand enough</p>
<p>about the world around us, which is a long time away. But maybe we can initially do this</p>
<p>in virtual environments. So you can imagine a video game where agents interact in some</p>
<p>ways and then some situations trigger an emotion. I think we could train machines to detect</p>
<p>those situations and predict that the particular emotion will likely be felt if a human was</p>
<p>playing one of the characters.</p>
<p>You have shown excitement and done a lot of excellent work with unsupervised learning.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s been a lot of success on the supervised learning side.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>And one of the things I&rsquo;m really passionate about is how humans and robots work together.</p>
<p>And in the context of supervised learning, that means the process of annotation. Do you</p>
<p>think about the problem of annotation put in a more interesting way as humans teaching</p>
<p>machines?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Is there?</p>
<p>Yes. I think it&rsquo;s an important subject. Reducing it to annotation may be useful for somebody</p>
<p>building a system tomorrow. But longer term, the process of teaching, I think, is something</p>
<p>that deserves a lot more attention from the machine learning community. So there are people</p>
<p>who have coined the term machine teaching. So what are good strategies for teaching a</p>
<p>learning agent? And can we design and train a system that is going to be a good teacher?</p>
<p>So in my group, we have a project called BBI or BBI game, where there is a game or scenario</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a learning agent and a teaching agent. Presumably, the teaching agent would</p>
<p>eventually be a human. But we&rsquo;re not there yet. And the role of the teacher is to use</p>
<p>its knowledge of the environment, which it can acquire using whatever way brute force</p>
<p>to help the learner learn as quickly as possible. So the learner is going to try to learn by</p>
<p>itself, maybe using some exploration and whatever. But the teacher can choose, can have an influence</p>
<p>on the interaction with the learner, so as to guide the learner, maybe teach it the things</p>
<p>that the learner has most trouble with, or just add the boundary between what it knows</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t know, and so on. So there&rsquo;s a tradition of these kind of ideas from other</p>
<p>fields and like tutorial systems, for example, and AI. And of course, people in the humanities</p>
<p>have been thinking about these questions. But I think it&rsquo;s time that machine learning</p>
<p>people look at this, because in the future, we&rsquo;ll have more and more human machine interaction</p>
<p>with the human in the loop. And I think understanding how to make this work better, all the problems</p>
<p>around that are very interesting and not sufficiently addressed. You&rsquo;ve done a lot of work with</p>
<p>language, too. What aspect of the traditionally formulated Turing test, a test of natural</p>
<p>language understanding and generation in your eyes is the most difficult of conversation?</p>
<p>What in your eyes is the hardest part of conversation to solve for machines? So I would say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>everything having to do with the non linguistic knowledge, which implicitly you need in order</p>
<p>to make sense of sentences, things like the Winograd schema. So these sentences that are</p>
<p>semantically ambiguous. In other words, you need to understand enough about the world</p>
<p>in order to really interpret properly those sentences. I think these are interesting challenges</p>
<p>for machine learning, because they point in the direction of building systems that both</p>
<p>understand how the world works and this causal relationships in the world and associate that</p>
<p>knowledge with how to express it in language, either for reading or writing.</p>
<p>You speak French?</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s my mother tongue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the romance languages. Do you think passing the Turing test and all the</p>
<p>underlying challenges we just mentioned depend on language? Do you think it might be easier</p>
<p>in French than it is in English, or is independent of language?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s independent of language. I would like to build systems that can use the same</p>
<p>principles, the same learning mechanisms to learn from human agents, whatever their language.</p>
<p>Well, certainly us humans can talk more beautifully and smoothly in poetry, some Russian originally.</p>
<p>I know poetry in Russian is maybe easier to convey complex ideas than it is in English.</p>
<p>But maybe I&rsquo;m showing my bias and some people could say that about French. But of course,</p>
<p>the goal ultimately is our human brain is able to utilize any kind of those languages</p>
<p>to use them as tools to convey meaning.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course, there are differences between languages, and maybe some are slightly better</p>
<p>at some things, but in the grand scheme of things, where we&rsquo;re trying to understand how</p>
<p>the brain works and language and so on, I think these differences are minute.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve lived perhaps through an AI winter of sorts?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>How did you stay warm and continue your research?</p>
<p>Stay warm with friends.</p>
<p>With friends. Okay, so it&rsquo;s important to have friends. And what have you learned from the</p>
<p>experience?</p>
<p>Listen to your inner voice. Don&rsquo;t, you know, be trying to just please the crowds and the</p>
<p>fashion. And if you have a strong intuition about something that is not contradicted by</p>
<p>actual evidence, go for it. I mean, it could be contradicted by people.</p>
<p>Not your own instinct of based on everything you&rsquo;ve learned?</p>
<p>Of course, you have to adapt your beliefs when your experiments contradict those beliefs.</p>
<p>But you have to stick to your beliefs. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s what allowed me to go through those years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what allowed me to persist in directions that, you know, took time, whatever other</p>
<p>people think, took time to mature and bring fruits.</p>
<p>So history of AI is marked with these, of course, it&rsquo;s marked with technical breakthroughs,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also marked with these seminal events that capture the imagination of the community.</p>
<p>Most recent, I would say, AlphaGo beating the world champion human Go player was one</p>
<p>of those moments. What do you think the next such moment might be?</p>
<p>Okay, so first of all, I think that these so called seminal events are overrated. As</p>
<p>I said, science really moves by small steps. Now what happens is you make one more small</p>
<p>step and it&rsquo;s like the drop that, you know, that fills the bucket and then you have drastic</p>
<p>consequences because now you&rsquo;re able to do something you were not able to do before.</p>
<p>Or now, say, the cost of building some device or solving a problem becomes cheaper than</p>
<p>what existed and you have a new market that opens up, right? So especially in the world</p>
<p>of commerce and applications, the impact of a small scientific progress could be huge.</p>
<p>But in the science itself, I think it&rsquo;s very, very gradual.</p>
<p>And where are these steps being taken now? So there&rsquo;s unsupervised learning.</p>
<p>So if I look at one trend that I like in my community, so for example, at Milan, my institute,</p>
<p>what are the two hardest topics? GANs and reinforcement learning. Even though in Montreal</p>
<p>in particular, reinforcement learning was something pretty much absent just two or three</p>
<p>years ago. So there&rsquo;s really a big interest from students and there&rsquo;s a big interest from</p>
<p>people like me. So I would say this is something where we&rsquo;re going to see more progress, even</p>
<p>though it hasn&rsquo;t yet provided much in terms of actual industrial fallout. Like even though</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s AlphaGo, there&rsquo;s no, like Google is not making money on this right now. But I</p>
<p>think over the long term, this is really, really important for many reasons.</p>
<p>So in other words, I would say reinforcement learning may be more generally agent learning</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t have to be with rewards. It could be in all kinds of ways that an agent</p>
<p>is learning about its environment.</p>
<p>Now reinforcement learning you&rsquo;re excited about, do you think GANs could provide something,</p>
<p>at the moment? Well, GANs or other generative models, I believe, will be crucial ingredients</p>
<p>in building agents that can understand the world. A lot of the successes in reinforcement</p>
<p>learning in the past has been with policy gradient, where you just learn a policy, you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t actually learn a model of the world. But there are lots of issues with that. And</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know how to do model based RL right now. But I think this is where we have to</p>
<p>go in order to build models that can generalize faster and better like to new distributions</p>
<p>that capture to some extent, at least the underlying causal mechanisms in the world.</p>
<p>Last question. What made you fall in love with artificial intelligence? If you look</p>
<p>back, what was the first moment in your life when you were fascinated by either the human</p>
<p>mind or the artificial mind?</p>
<p>You know, when I was an adolescent, I was reading a lot. And then I started reading</p>
<p>science fiction.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s where I got hooked. And then, you know, I had one of the first personal</p>
<p>computers and I got hooked in programming. And so it just, you know,</p>
<p>Start with fiction and then make it a reality.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Yoshua, thank you so much for talking to me.</p>
<p>My pleasure.</p>
