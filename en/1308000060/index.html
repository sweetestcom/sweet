    <p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the sweaters. Okay. Let David, let&rsquo;s start with you because I love it.</p>
<p>I love it, David. I love it. I decided to up my sweater game for Chamath. This is Tom Ford.</p>
<p>Love it. Tom Ford. Tom Ford. The buttons are made out of endangered rhino horn.</p>
<p>We just lost a third of the audience.</p>
<p>So my sweater is a very light Italian cashmere made by a company called Doriani. Doriani cashmere.</p>
<p>I thought we weren&rsquo;t doing plugs for our startups.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re monetizing the all-in pod.</p>
<p>Here we go. Doriani cashmere just got a free.</p>
<p>This right here, this right here is a little young calf leather. Very soft, very soft.</p>
<p>And the buttons, like David&rsquo;s, are made from shark fin.</p>
<p>And for those of you at home who would like to spend $150 and stay warm,</p>
<p>may I recommend the marine layer? You can find it on Union Street Jacket.</p>
<p>You can also find that jacket on Turk Street.</p>
<p>How tilted is Sweater Karen listening to this? Sweater Karen, if you&rsquo;re listening,</p>
<p>I mean, you must never reveal.</p>
<p>Sweater Karen got back to me and she was like, oh my God, he&rsquo;s so tilted.</p>
<p>I think I know who she is.</p>
<p>Sweater Karen can kiss my brown ass.</p>
<p>So Jade comes home last night. I kid you not. She&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t like you in the t-shirts.</p>
<p>I got you some sweaters because we&rsquo;re going to the mountains for the holiday.</p>
<p>And I was like, did you watch the podcast about the sweater?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, no, I don&rsquo;t listen to your podcast.</p>
<p>I was like, okay, fair enough.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m looking at these things.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all in these boxes.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s got this bunch of sweaters.</p>
<p>I started, I was like, what did you spend on this?</p>
<p>She said $3,000.</p>
<p>I was like, I&rsquo;m not comfortable spending $3,000 on a sweater.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s half a sweater.</p>
<p>Let alone eight of them.</p>
<p>But she was like, no, no, it&rsquo;s $3,000 for all eight.</p>
<p>Yeah, Chamath is like, is that a sleeve?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s $3,000 for all eight sweaters.</p>
<p>Four buttons and a waistband?</p>
<p>That might be a vest for Chamath.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the box the sweater came in was $3,000.</p>
<p>So I got my three quarter zip and I&rsquo;m feeling good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling really good.</p>
<p>I feel pretty sexy in it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest.</p>
<p>I love you guys.</p>
<p>I love you guys.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody.</p>

<p>The dictator himself in a amazing sweater.</p>
<p>Light, light cashmere gilet.</p>
<p>The sultan of science.</p>
<p>I found out from his mom.</p>
<p>She much prefers the sultan of science to queen of quinoa.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going with going forward.</p>
<p>David Friedberg, who had a great party up in Beep.</p>
<p>And I really enjoyed going.</p>
<p>And Sachs, who didn&rsquo;t go to Beep&rsquo;s party or to Friedberg&rsquo;s party.</p>
<p>He stayed home and played chess on his iPhone.</p>
<p>The rain man himself, David Sachs.</p>
<p>Welcome to the pod, everybody.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You want my two New York stories?</p>
<p>My one true bestie, Jason Calacanis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>I really wanted to come, but Nat&rsquo;s breastfeeding.</p>
<p>And so I couldn&rsquo;t come.</p>
<p>The helipad was shut down.</p>
<p>Chamath couldn&rsquo;t land.</p>
<p>You were getting breastfed?</p>
<p>Oh, jeez.</p>
<p>Was there a Curb Your Enthusiasm?</p>
<p>Oh, no, it was this great show called Afterlife from Ricky Gervais.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s literally a scene in it where a woman.</p>
<p>They work for a local newspaper that&rsquo;s going out of business,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to do local stories.</p>
<p>And the big story in town is a woman is making</p>
<p>pudding, incredibly delicious pudding, and it&rsquo;s from her breast milk.</p>
<p>And they go and cover the story.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ll just leave it at that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty amazing story.</p>
<p>Do you want to know my two New York stories or not?</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s hear it.</p>
<p>Well, you said you had a helicopter story.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>A helicopter story.</p>
<p>Helicopter is also a New York story.</p>
<p>So I went to Deepdale to play golf with a certain well-known individual.</p>
<p>And we chop her back.</p>
<p>A finance individual?</p>
<p>Politics.</p>
<p>Well-known political individual.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>So this is not a rock and roller.</p>
<p>You do not want to step foot in a helicopter with a rock and roll star.</p>
<p>No, but so here&rsquo;s my story, which is why I totally freaked out about helicopters.</p>
<p>This was eight years ago.</p>
<p>We played Deepdale, which is just outside New York.</p>
<p>The chopper lands in the middle of the thing.</p>
<p>I was like, okay, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going, and I&rsquo;m already feeling kind of skittish.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like helicopters.</p>
<p>Get to the Eastside Heliport.</p>
<p>And the Eastside Heliport is basically right by the East River.</p>
<p>And so the helicopter descends.</p>
<p>And one of the skis doesn&rsquo;t actually land on the fucking thing.</p>
<p>And so he does a little tilty poops.</p>
<p>And then the guy comes back up, and then he lands.</p>
<p>Honestly, like I have never been more scared in my life.</p>
<p>All right, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And I was like, that&rsquo;s it, never again.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want any besties.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bestie band for life.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re making a pact here.</p>
<p>Nobody in fucking South Africa.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m on New York.</p>
<p>Last New York story was I was there two days ago.</p>
<p>Or for the last couple of days.</p>
<p>For SantaCon?</p>
<p>In the middle of this Omicron breakout.</p>
<p>By the way, had a beautiful dinner.</p>
<p>After the game, Draymond, Kevin, Dread, me, bunch of friends.</p>
<p>Did you go to the game?</p>
<p>No, we went to the private room at Carbone.</p>
<p>It was so brutal, though, I have to tell you.</p>
<p>I feel so disgusting with myself.</p>
<p>I had a work dinner.</p>
<p>And I have sushi at the work dinner.</p>
<p>And then, you know, Dray texts after the game.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, hey, we&rsquo;re all having dinner at Carbone.</p>
<p>I said, okay, I&rsquo;ll head through.</p>
<p>I went to the hotel.</p>
<p>I called Nat and I said, I&rsquo;m brushing my teeth.</p>
<p>And she said, but you&rsquo;re going out.</p>
<p>And I said, yes, but if I brush my teeth,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to eat a second dinner.</p>
<p>And I thought, you know, and then,</p>
<p>but I made the key mistake, but I didn&rsquo;t floss.</p>
<p>So I was unflossed, but I brushed my teeth.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I show up and fucking, I lose it.</p>
<p>And wine and dessert and bread and pasta, pasta, pasta.</p>
<p>Oh, rigatoni, alabaca, uh-oh.</p>
<p>It was really brutal.</p>
<p>And by 3 a.m., I stumble home.</p>
<p>And I felt so bad because I had to wake up at like, you know,</p>
<p>eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>
<p>No, my first meeting was at 745.</p>
<p>Well, congratulations to Seth Curry, by the way.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>No, he&rsquo;s a shooter of all time.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a virtuoso.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Anyways, that was my, that was my New York story.</p>
<p>I gained, you know, here&rsquo;s my, here&rsquo;s my, I gained one kilo,</p>
<p>2.2 pounds.</p>
<p>I gained in two days.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my carbone story.</p>
<p>Hardest thing to the hardest reservation to get in New York.</p>
<p>Saks is like, Jake, I&rsquo;ll need to help me a favor.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the best place in New York to do a closing dinner?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I got you.</p>
<p>I got my guy, get my guy on the horn.</p>
<p>My guy&rsquo;s like, okay, I got you.</p>
<p>Carbone Friday, fucking night, eight o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>Hardest ticket in New York.</p>
<p>You know what Saks does?</p>
<p>It goes dark.</p>
<p>Friday afternoon, 1pm.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, yeah, we&rsquo;re not going to make it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, my friend is like, J Kyle, your guy burned the carbone res.</p>
<p>That was the bird IPO.</p>
<p>I was going to take the founder out to dinner that night at carbone.</p>
<p>And then it turned into like the big group dinner with like 30 people.</p>
<p>So it moved over to,</p>
<p>well, by the way, the, the, the, the private room, which is like, you know,</p>
<p>not in the restaurant, but it&rsquo;s like a little bit on the side.</p>
<p>It only fits like 15, 20 people.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like you, you can, and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s then it&rsquo;s really tight.</p>
<p>How, what was Steph&rsquo;s, uh, how did Steph feel?</p>
<p>No, Steph wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>Draymond, Kevin, me, Benny Fowler, Morrell, but just a bunch of us.</p>
<p>You said Kevin, Kevin Durant?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Kevin Durant still, huh?</p>
<p>Friendly with, uh.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s honestly, he&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s such a great guy.</p>
<p>I love Kevin.</p>
<p>He really, he is really, really, really great.</p>
<p>Wish he had stayed.</p>
<p>Super, super sensitive.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s friends again with, uh, he&rsquo;s always, he&rsquo;s always, he was always.</p>
<p>I think that when they had their blow up, it was more like their brothers.</p>
<p>And it was just a little bit like when you started talking like Joe Pesci.</p>
<p>Did, did Kevin Durant ever start talking like Joe Pesci?</p>
<p>Inside baseball.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>It was an eventful week on Twitter.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re only one week into the new Twitter CEO&rsquo;s reign.</p>
<p>Jack is gone.</p>
<p>And already David Sachs has been flagged.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a guy.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t be a coincidence that you were talking about them flagging accounts at the end of free</p>
<p>speech and then pull it up on the screen.</p>
<p>Everybody.</p>
<p>Investors should be spending their time finding good investments, not endlessly debating interest</p>
<p>rates, inflation and tax policy.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the uncertainty Washington has created.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great tweet.</p>
<p>I like that tweet, actually.</p>
<p>And then the flag, the conversation from Sachs has been flagged.</p>
<p>Some conversations can get heavy.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget the human behind the screen.</p>
<p>Do you think that this is that&rsquo;s machine learned?</p>
<p>Or do you think that that&rsquo;s an editor that goes in there and actually manually flags</p>
<p>machine learned?</p>
<p>No, I think it&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>But what is, but what is in there that actually triggers debating?</p>
<p>Washington.</p>
<p>Interest rates, tax policy, Washington.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that you could build.</p>
<p>Or maybe it&rsquo;s the ratio.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how you would build a function that would weight this in a way where this</p>
<p>could get flagged of all the things you could say with those words.</p>
<p>This is so benign.</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s the kind of it seems to be this thing&rsquo;s kind of ward off bullying</p>
<p>attacks on Sachs, which I don&rsquo;t think Sachs needs to be too worried about.</p>
<p>All right, because you&rsquo;re telling this to people who would reply.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s there to protect me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to protect you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of those things where they&rsquo;re like trying to get people to not insult you in</p>
<p>the comments.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re talking about that.</p>
<p>Maybe you get a lot.</p>
<p>Do you get it?</p>
<p>Do you get a lot of insults and comments on your tweets?</p>
<p>Oh, undoubtedly.</p>
<p>But so it could just be a blanket.</p>
<p>This this tweets comments section was pretty benign.</p>
<p>Oh, right.</p>
<p>It may not be about the tweet.</p>
<p>It might be about the replies.</p>
<p>So it might be that this wasn&rsquo;t that hot.</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t that hot.</p>
<p>I think your mouth might be onto something.</p>
<p>You know, Michelle Tandler got the same label around the same day for a tweet that seemed</p>
<p>totally innocuous too.</p>
<p>So what I wonder about is, you know, is this label to protect us or is it a way?</p>
<p>Is it sort of a passive aggressive way for snowflakes at Twitter to like label people</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t like and sort of suggest they&rsquo;re vaguely disreputable?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a left wing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the it&rsquo;s the libs going after the right sacks.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re paranoid.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen any liberals getting.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen any left wing people.</p>
<p>There seems to be a blanket attempt at trying to kind of mute the tone a little bit across</p>
<p>the debating that happens in the comments that come across in the replies.</p>
<p>And I think they&rsquo;re just trying to like get everyone to tone it down a bit before you</p>
<p>tweet it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be really interesting to know whether this was algorithmic or is editorial because</p>
<p>I think if it&rsquo;s editorial, it does actually I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s as extreme as what David</p>
<p>just said, but it skews more in the realm of like people with an axe to grind can flag</p>
<p>one thing over another or not.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s algorithmic, I think that that algorithm probably just needs a lot of tweaking</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Well, anyway, this doesn&rsquo;t it say that there&rsquo;s a person behind the tweet?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like trying to get people to not say.</p>
<p>Something wrong with the warning.</p>
<p>The warning is charming.</p>
<p>The warning is charming.</p>
<p>Charming.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trying to get you to be nice to each other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like your mom inserting herself and being like, now, remember.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s there to suggest that there might be something wrong with the content that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>being posted.</p>
<p>Well, you know, in other words, in other words, the content is so triggering that, you know,</p>
<p>it needs warning labels.</p>
<p>Do you guys think that paternalism has a role on social networks to try and</p>
<p>mullify the the kind of discourse being too acrimonious?</p>
<p>Like, I think we need some of the transparency that Jack Dorsey repeatedly promised at all</p>
<p>the congressional hearings.</p>
<p>Remember when he got hauled up there, he promised that they would give more transparency about</p>
<p>the way that their algorithms worked.</p>
<p>Where is that?</p>
<p>And it hasn&rsquo;t been delivered up.</p>
<p>They promised it.</p>
<p>Now, Jack Dorsey&rsquo;s skipped out of town and there&rsquo;s a new guy in charge.</p>
<p>Well, we need to know how these algorithms work because they are pressing their thumb</p>
<p>on the scale, you know, of debate in the marketplace of ideas by suggesting that some</p>
<p>ideas are sketchier than others.</p>
<p>They should just put here.</p>
<p>This was algorithmically done based on they should explain it underneath or there should</p>
<p>be a little question mark over the question mark based on the words in the thread.</p>
<p>It feels like things are getting heated here.</p>
<p>We did this with an algorithm or.</p>
<p>Users reported this as a heated thread.</p>
<p>So we put this here or a human decided no, we decided Yeah,</p>
<p>but you want it to be an open marketplace of ideas.</p>
<p>But the fact is, it&rsquo;s Twitter&rsquo;s marketplace of ideas.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And Facebook&rsquo;s is Facebook&rsquo;s marketplace of ideas.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re going to get away from any of these</p>
<p>centralized social networks, having anything but some degree of moderation to play a role</p>
<p>in a related thing.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t just target sacks.</p>
<p>Also, Chamath, you didn&rsquo;t see this, but they flagged one of your tweets just this afternoon.</p>
<p>Pull it up.</p>
<p>As you can see here, it&rsquo;s a slightly different one.</p>
<p>It says layers are for players.</p>
<p>This conversation will drift to $5,000 sweaters.</p>
<p>So a big warning for Chamath to just end for the people replying.</p>
<p>Be careful.</p>
<p>This must be that must be then that must have been human.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>And this one came in for Prof G.</p>
<p>Another one came in for Prof G.</p>
<p>And in this case, I think they&rsquo;re actually trying to think about the public good.</p>
<p>This guy is full of shit.</p>
<p>He thought JCPenney would beat Amazon.</p>
<p>How many hours of masterclass Adobe Photoshop did you take to get this?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t make these.</p>
<p>My meme team did.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m convinced that there&rsquo;s two ways to raise your next fund in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>One, have one of the top 50 podcasts in the world, or two, have a strong meme game.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going for both.</p>
<p>Sax now has a warning on his.</p>
<p>And they put it on your profile page.</p>
<p>This was crazy warning.</p>
<p>This person is interesting things to say.</p>
<p>If you if you&rsquo;re too interesting, you get labeled now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really crazy.</p>
<p>No, I saw Jake.</p>
<p>I saw Jake having too much fun with this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I gotta get it on this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, I need a meme team.</p>
<p>If anybody out there, I don&rsquo;t care if you&rsquo;re I need a comedian.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to pay on a paper meme, a paper viral, whatever it takes.</p>
<p>Okay, in a related story, Democrats want racial equity audits at tech companies,</p>
<p>according to the Washington Free Beacon, which sacks correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s some sort of wacky right wing publication.</p>
<p>Never heard of it.</p>
<p>Okay, Washington Free Beacon, if instituted orders would have veto power over</p>
<p>every product or initiative.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not an exaggeration is what the story says.</p>
<p>One proposal from House Democrats would fine companies 20,000 a day for not</p>
<p>completing by annual independent racial equity audits.</p>
<p>A left wing nonprofit called color of change is pushing for these audits.</p>
<p>Last week, their president called for independent auditors to vet new products</p>
<p>from tech companies before they&rsquo;re released in front of Congress.</p>
<p>2018 color of change successfully pushed Facebook into completing an audit.</p>
<p>They call for more restrictions on Trump&rsquo;s post.</p>
<p>Co change itself pushed for Trump to be permanently banned from the platform.</p>
<p>Just so you know, this is exactly the the rough version of what happened to Microsoft</p>
<p>in their DOJ settlement, their antitrust settlement was effectively an oversight</p>
<p>where lawyers at the DOJ were the product managers and had not effectively veto right,</p>
<p>but you had to approve product features before you could push them for 10 years.</p>
<p>You know, this is essentially what caused bombers rain.</p>
<p>Just be so you know, in ominous is like you couldn&rsquo;t do anything because like you had you</p>
<p>had a plan to do something.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d have to go to these random folks who didn&rsquo;t really have the context to make a</p>
<p>decision.</p>
<p>One way or the other on feature.</p>
<p>So I mean, the idea that they would do this is a pretty it&rsquo;s pretty crazy.</p>
<p>I need a point of clarification here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard the term racial audits or racial equity audits.</p>
<p>My understanding of those were to understand the composure of the company in terms of,</p>
<p>you know, the diversity in the company, but this is something different.</p>
<p>This is in the product to make sure the product isn&rsquo;t racist.</p>
<p>Can products be racist?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s an example of a product being racist?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand what they would find.</p>
<p>Let me unpack this for you.</p>
<p>Okay, what they are basically saying is that these big companies and the for example,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve called on Google to conduct one of these audits.</p>
<p>They want all these big companies conduct these audits.</p>
<p>These so called auditors are actually political consultants who are members of the Democratic</p>
<p>Party who are friends of the senators are pushing for this.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re political activists.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a grift.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s partly a grift, but it&rsquo;s more than that.</p>
<p>Because, you know, when you conduct an audit, let&rsquo;s just take this word audit for a second,</p>
<p>okay?</p>
<p>You bring in a big five accounting firm, and they will check your numbers according to</p>
<p>generally accepted accounting principles gap and make sure that the numbers are what you</p>
<p>reported them to be.</p>
<p>That is the purpose of an audit.</p>
<p>And if the auditor ever says that you&rsquo;ve done anything wrong, like you have to fix it, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no choice.</p>
<p>Or you can appeal to some other auditor and have them redo the work, okay, according to</p>
<p>these generally accepted principles.</p>
<p>With an equity audit, what exactly are the principles that are being enforced or checked</p>
<p>here?</p>
<p>There is no generally accepted list of equity principles that must be enforced these companies.</p>
<p>Basically, you have to do whatever this political activist tells you to do.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s essentially like bringing in a party commissar to now take over the company</p>
<p>or at least be inside the company telling the executives and officer of the company</p>
<p>what to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that frankly, the CCP would do.</p>
<p>It does feel a little like, yeah, Stasi.</p>
<p>Like, didn&rsquo;t we have all of the companies on their own from Twitter to Google to Facebook</p>
<p>release their own diversity stats years ago?</p>
<p>I think this is about diversity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about equity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about equity.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s explain the difference in what that means.</p>
<p>This is somehow how the companies run like the day to day life of the employees.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not just the composure and the breakdown of the employees.</p>
<p>Look, equity, equity means anything that progressives say it means.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen on this program before how equity has dumped the shark.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s now there&rsquo;s a provision in the infrastructure bill for tree equity.</p>
<p>So I mean, really, any disparity that occurs that progressives don&rsquo;t like can now be called</p>
<p>a violation of equity.</p>
<p>And this gives them the authorization to come in there and start giving orders.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very weird that I don&rsquo;t understand how the product then review gets</p>
<p>stopped to throttle you from a leasing product as a punitive.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example.</p>
<p>So recently, you know, I wrote a piece called the no buy list where I basically you had</p>
<p>companies like PayPal and some of these other financial firms were starting to deny service</p>
<p>to customers to users based on their political affiliations.</p>
<p>And not just like people who are in, you know, well known hate groups that like everybody</p>
<p>sort of, you know, issues and wants to stay away from.</p>
<p>But these are people with relatively down the middle conservative, you know, conservative</p>
<p>groups, and they were being denied service by, you know, fintech firms.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m not saying that this is what this means.</p>
<p>But if this equity auditors tells you, well, look, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s equitable to allow</p>
<p>these conservative groups to, you know, be a user of your product.</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s the company going to do?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna have to listen to that.</p>
<p>And that that is a plausible scenario, given that it&rsquo;s already occurred.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all we&rsquo;ve we&rsquo;ve said this so many times on the pod, but I just want to say it again,</p>
<p>for because I guess a lot of folks are new and listening.</p>
<p>Whenever you hear equity used by a politician, it usually means there&rsquo;s a power grab involved.</p>
<p>Yeah, because if you really want things to be fair, you want things to be equal,</p>
<p>meritocracy, you want equality.</p>
<p>But whenever you start throwing the word equity around and say we want racial equity,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a bunch of, you know, a small number of people</p>
<p>who, you know, basically have and live by what I, you know, what&rsquo;s often called luxury beliefs,</p>
<p>who want to judge other people who want to be morally absolutist, and then who want to</p>
<p>basically, like, you know, exercise a power grab.</p>
<p>And we have to push back on that stuff, because it&rsquo;s just a slippery, slippery slope.</p>
<p>Well, this also seems like overbearing red tape for companies.</p>
<p>I mean, if the company has no problems, no complaints against it,</p>
<p>you know, releases their diversity numbers, like, what is the point of going?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s use let&rsquo;s use an example that builds on what David said, let&rsquo;s take square,</p>
<p>okay, one of the one of the most incredible things that square did</p>
<p>was in a hackathon, essentially, build a cash app.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And one of the most incredible things that happened in the cash app was that it</p>
<p>really started to blow up in urban communities.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And it starts to normalize banking, opening up bank accounts, having more savings,</p>
<p>understanding, you know, an on ramp into crypto, you know, cash app has probably done more to get</p>
<p>black and brown people into crypto and to save money and to understand their cash than almost</p>
<p>anybody else as as like, almost explicit strategy.</p>
<p>And so if somebody&rsquo;s supposed to go in there and just, you know, arbitrarily judge whether</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s too many white people that work at square or not enough black people, and so</p>
<p>XYZ thing has to change, or such and such a feature doesn&rsquo;t actually speak to folks,</p>
<p>so you can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s insanity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like also to your point, Saks is what, what are the, what do these people know?</p>
<p>Like, what is their qualification?</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the goal?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And to build on Jamal&rsquo;s point, if these senators, so I think Cory Booker was the one who proposed</p>
<p>this.</p>
<p>If these senators want those specific policies implemented in the fortune 500, let them pass</p>
<p>a bill to do it and let all of our elected representatives vote on that bill.</p>
<p>And then we can see if it&rsquo;ll really if it&rsquo;s popular enough to pass, and whether it passes</p>
<p>constitutional muster, they won&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Because these bills, if they were directly concretized for</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have legs.</p>
<p>Would be very unpopular.</p>
<p>So instead, what they do is tell you, well, we&rsquo;re not going to do this directly, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to put pressure on these big companies to hire one of our political friends, again,</p>
<p>this like commissar like person, and empower them to tell these companies what to do.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really kind of insidious what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re kind of covering it all up with these nice sounding names.</p>
<p>I mean, who could be against a racial equity audit?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Because this, yes, if you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re against it, you must be a racist, and you must not</p>
<p>believe in auditing companies.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>You have to you just it&rsquo;s a word game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s using words that are really loaded and mean a lot to a lot of us, right?</p>
<p>If I hear racism and race, my ears are triggering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not triggering, but my ears perk up.</p>
<p>And I have, I have a lot of inbuilt opinions on it that have been governed by 45 years</p>
<p>as living as a, as a brown man.</p>
<p>And so, okay, it stands to reason that I&rsquo;m going to pay attention.</p>
<p>But on the surface, if you say racial equity audit, it also doesn&rsquo;t seem actually all that</p>
<p>bad.</p>
<p>It seems like reasonably benign.</p>
<p>And that seems like an okay thing to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that most of us then stop at that point and move on.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But if you actually look at the rules, again, I would just say whenever political frameworks</p>
<p>use the word we need to create more equity, the outcomes are horrible.</p>
<p>For example, look in healthcare.</p>
<p>You know, if we have used this idea of healthcare equity, health equity, and we&rsquo;ve misused it</p>
<p>to such a degree.</p>
<p>And all we see is that now the system is so perverted.</p>
<p>It also doesn&rsquo;t work for the majority of people that have actually had the healthcare system</p>
<p>work for it, right?</p>
<p>Like at the top of the pecking order has always been white men have always gotten the best</p>
<p>care.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve always measured our healthcare progress in America based on the longevity of men,</p>
<p>white men, you know, 78, 79, 80 years old, and then it started to degrade.</p>
<p>And people were curious what was happening.</p>
<p>And underneath it all was just a bunch of power grabs under the realm of equity.</p>
<p>We passed all these crazy laws, we basically didn&rsquo;t do anything to really create more</p>
<p>accountability and a cost based system.</p>
<p>And here we are.</p>
<p>So at some point, when the citizenry hears that word, you&rsquo;re going to have to put your</p>
<p>thinking cap on and actually take the opposite view, which is hold on, this is a really nice</p>
<p>sounding word.</p>
<p>It may not be what I think it is.</p>
<p>And I got to pay attention because more than if I didn&rsquo;t hear the word at all,</p>
<p>anything you have on race, Friedberg, representing</p>
<p>South Africans,</p>
<p>fundamentally, I don&rsquo;t think this is about race, Jake, I think this is about power,</p>
<p>power.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about it feels like a power grip.</p>
<p>Also, it feels like a little grip.</p>
<p>It feels like a little bit of a grift.</p>
<p>I know I had heard on the back channel that a lot of the people who are criticizing some</p>
<p>big tech companies who were getting, you know, I&rsquo;m not gonna say who or under what</p>
<p>moniker sweater Karen, Karen, but there was a group of people who are like attacking</p>
<p>big Karen, if she has an opinion on sweater, she must have an opinion on racial equity.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Okay, leave sweater Karen has the issue is, they would complain and create these, you</p>
<p>know, basically, you know, Twitter mobs.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;d say, Oh, yeah, and hire us for $20,000.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll come in and fix the problem for you.</p>
<p>So they were creating the Twitter mob to come in and solve the problem.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so it was like, Oh, wow, that is</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so brutal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so dirty.</p>
<p>No, I mean, these HR consultants who&rsquo;ve written these books, like on the was it</p>
<p>D&rsquo;Angelo or whatever on white fragility, and, you know, how to be an anti racist.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re all making a fortune in corporate fees, you know, charging</p>
<p>20 $30,000 per, per gig.</p>
<p>I mean, it is absolutely a racket.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of equality of outcome.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more a fan of equality of opportunity.</p>
<p>And I think many, many of these sorts of folks, I try and identify methods to drive equality</p>
<p>of outcome.</p>
<p>And it inhibits the competitive forces that cause the best person, the best idea, the</p>
<p>best business, the best market model to win.</p>
<p>And, you know, I think it&rsquo;s easy to conflate the two when you don&rsquo;t really think through</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>But it is certainly appropriate and reasonable to make sure that folks aren&rsquo;t discriminated</p>
<p>against when they apply for a job.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s appropriate to then apply considerations of race and other factors when</p>
<p>people are equally in the same job on who gets to have the chance at the bonus, it is</p>
<p>the best performer that should have the chance at the bonus.</p>
<p>And the same should be true in marketplaces and the same should be true at business.</p>
<p>And I think that what we&rsquo;re really seeing is this fundamental effort to try and generate</p>
<p>equality and outcomes in lots of different manifestations.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re seeing it more frequently and more severely than we&rsquo;ve seen it historically.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the right model.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only going to lead to the demise of marketplace dynamics and the things that</p>
<p>cause forces for success and progress to win.</p>
<p>You know, we mentioned this a couple of times, I&rsquo;ll just say it again.</p>
<p>But we are about to have probably the most significant movement and questioning of equity</p>
<p>versus equality.</p>
<p>Because I think in the next month, maybe in the next two months, we&rsquo;re going to sort of</p>
<p>see a pretty strict opinion on affirmative action.</p>
<p>And if you talk to legal scholars, the overwhelming consensus is this is gone.</p>
<p>And, you know, we&rsquo;re going to have to figure out how to rebuild, you know, what was a really</p>
<p>important system that tried to give folks at least, you know, getting to the starting</p>
<p>line in the same way.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not gonna it&rsquo;s not really gonna exist in this in the same way shape or form.</p>
<p>Speaking of Karens, Elizabeth Warren was bashing Elon over taxes.</p>
<p>And Elon has a Twitter handle with some followers, and he responded.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Warren says, let&rsquo;s change the rigged tax code.</p>
<p>So the person the year will actually pay taxes and stop freeloading off everyone else.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Elizabeth Warren, Elon Musk is pretty good at Twitter, he replied.</p>
<p>And if you opened your eyes for two seconds, you would realize I pay more taxes than any</p>
<p>American in history this year, he paid, which is, I guess, true, he paid more in taxes now</p>
<p>than any American in history.</p>
<p>As a side note, Elizabeth Warren has a $12 million net worth, and I saw that she paid</p>
<p>no taxes on her equity holdings because she didn&rsquo;t sell anything, which is how the tax</p>
<p>code works.</p>
<p>And Elon then responded.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t spend it all at once.</p>
<p>Oh, wait, you already did.</p>
<p>And then, you know, after the warm up replies, Elon really, you know, got in the zone and</p>
<p>like Steph Curry, just started draining half court shots.</p>
<p>He ratioed her every single time.</p>
<p>Ratioed her with 50,000 replies.</p>
<p>Yeah, you remind me of when I was a kid, and my friend&rsquo;s angry mom would just randomly</p>
<p>yell at everyone for no reason.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t call the manager on me, Senator Karen, you want also responded to Bernie Sanders</p>
<p>tweet today about climate change.</p>
<p>Bernie Sanders said, when future generations ask us, what do we do to stop the climate</p>
<p>crisis?</p>
<p>How will they answer?</p>
<p>And Elon said, and so great tweets.</p>
<p>But to the bigger picture, did these people even know what&rsquo;s going on in the world?</p>
<p>No, they woke up, they woke up on the wrong side of the tilt bed.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because in like a 24 hour period, he was the time person of the year, the FT person of</p>
<p>the year.</p>
<p>And they just went into super mega tilt mode.</p>
<p>And the Build Back Better Act got shelved.</p>
<p>And he and then build back better got shelved and well, I mean, you know, I think we talked</p>
<p>about this last week, but that bill is dead now.</p>
<p>I mean, they pushed it to March to basically avoid a downvote.</p>
<p>Nothing&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>David, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>We said last week, wouldn&rsquo;t it be hilarious if Elon said kill it, and then it got killed?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t think that that&rsquo;s why the bill is dying.</p>
<p>I think the real reason is that we now see a Fed posture, which is actually pretty reasonable,</p>
<p>which actually says, Oh, wait, there&rsquo;s way too much money in the system as it is.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, the Fed two days ago basically said, we&rsquo;re going to see up to three rate hikes</p>
<p>next year, probably 50 basis points each.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s basically acknowledging that these these last, you know, several years,</p>
<p>we have printed way too much money, and they&rsquo;re trying to fix the problem that they created.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, I think, the real reason.</p>
<p>And then the CBO comes out and basically says the Congressional Budget Office and says,</p>
<p>this thing is a white albatross that&rsquo;s going to cost way more than you guys think it will.</p>
<p>And so it puts Biden in this very awkward situation, which is, you know, on the one</p>
<p>hand, he supports Powell.</p>
<p>And, you know, he supports institutions or has historically like the CBO.</p>
<p>But he effectively then has to push back on both of them all in one fall swoop to try to</p>
<p>ram this bill down people&rsquo;s throats.</p>
<p>And the support is, I think it&rsquo;s crumbling.</p>
<p>And so, you know, to save face, they basically said, Well, we&rsquo;ll put a pin on this, and we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>revisit it in March.</p>
<p>But you guys know what&rsquo;s going to happen in the next three months, there&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>some other crisis, most folks will forget, and it may just allow them to move on without</p>
<p>having to actually deal with the potential of this thing getting defeated, which would</p>
<p>just be, I think, cataclysmically bad for sex for Democrats,</p>
<p>you were on CNBC today, I thought you said something really important where you said,</p>
<p>Listen, maybe if we just calm things down for a year, we can, you know, get through</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what the exact quote was, but maybe you could unpack that sentiment you</p>
<p>had on CNBC today, because I thought that was pretty important.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I mean, I agree with what Chamath said, this, I mean, this, this BBB bill was</p>
<p>particularly anachronistic once the 6.8%, you know, inflation print came out.</p>
<p>In other words, we&rsquo;re in a hyperinflationary environment.</p>
<p>And here comes this bill that the CBO says, if, you know, over 10 years would cost $5</p>
<p>trillion, that&rsquo;s the last thing we need is more money printing when you know, we&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>this inflationary fire out of control.</p>
<p>So I think that is why the bill is being shelved, probably not to return.</p>
<p>I think that the larger problem that we have in the markets is that there&rsquo;s a tremendous</p>
<p>amount of uncertainty being created right now by Washington, we&rsquo;ve had tremendous uncertainty</p>
<p>over spending, over taxes, over interest rates.</p>
<p>And the conversations that I&rsquo;m having with friends who are investors in really every</p>
<p>asset class, real estate, VC, crypto, the conversations are all the same, what&rsquo;s interest</p>
<p>rates going to do?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the macro picture going to be?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen investors who should be focused on, hey, do I invest this company or buy this</p>
<p>building, whatever.</p>
<p>Those aren&rsquo;t the conversations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all everyone&rsquo;s a macroeconomist now.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re also distracted by this.</p>
<p>And so now the Fed a couple of days ago finally gave us clarity.</p>
<p>I mean, what they basically said is they&rsquo;re going to accelerate the taper, they&rsquo;ll, they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>end quantitative easing at the end of Q1.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re basically going to get</p>
<p>explain what that means to people who don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;ve been purchasing and why.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, quantitative easing is kind of a weird term.</p>
<p>What it means is the Fed has been going into the bond market and buying bonds.</p>
<p>I think basically mortgage-backed securities and treasuries.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve been buying, I think, about $90 billion a month.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to cut that back to $60 billion a month.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;ll continue.</p>
<p>Just to explain it a little bit more, when you do that, what you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re giving</p>
<p>somebody that owns those bonds money.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So the Fed prints money.</p>
<p>The government prints $100, takes that $100, steps into the market, and takes something</p>
<p>from you, in this case, it&rsquo;s a bond, and gives you that freshly printed $100.</p>
<p>What are you going to do?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re probably going to go and spend that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to buy other things.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the cycle of inflation that quantitative easing basically creates.</p>
<p>And so when you talk about tapering, what that means is slowing down the money printing</p>
<p>machine and slowing down you stepping in the market and buying assets with money that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve created out of thin air.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s up to other people to buy those assets.</p>
<p>If other people see value in them, you then are forced to find the real market clearing</p>
<p>price.</p>
<p>Yeah, those bonds are now on the Fed&rsquo;s balance sheet.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a very interesting chart showing assets that are owned by the Fed.</p>
<p>And it went up by something like $3 trillion during COVID.</p>
<p>So that is the sort of monetary stimulus that&rsquo;s been pumped into the market over the last</p>
<p>couple of years.</p>
<p>Separately, we&rsquo;ve had something like six or $7 trillion of just spending by the government.</p>
<p>So, you know, tremendous amount of</p>
<p>$3 trillion is not thrown away.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re clear, we&rsquo;re going to get interest on that.</p>
<p>And people, some number will default, some of them will get paid back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a way of stimulating the economy.</p>
<p>But we now know after this stimmy checks, and all the stimulus we did during the pandemic,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t need to put more fire or oxygen or kerosene on what we got going in this economy.</p>
<p>Correct, David?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, we should show that chart about how much the Fed&rsquo;s balance sheet has grown over</p>
<p>the last couple of years.</p>
<p>But, you know, the argument I think would be the reason why they buy these assets is if</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re buying bonds, it basically means that it keeps the yield down, right?</p>
<p>Because if they weren&rsquo;t the ones buying them, someone else would have to buy these bonds to</p>
<p>keep the government funded.</p>
<p>And they might demand a higher interest rate, a higher yield on the bonds.</p>
<p>So this by having the Fed come in and increase the demand for the government&rsquo;s debt, it means</p>
<p>that the government can sell its debt more cheaply.</p>
<p>So when they stop doing that, I think you can expect that, you know, interest rates</p>
<p>are going to need to rise in order to make our debt attractive to, you know, to bond buyers.</p>
<p>The other thing, the other thing, by the way, that the Fed did when they did that was it</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t just government bonds that they were buying.</p>
<p>They decided completely arbitrarily at one point to start buying certain corporate debt.</p>
<p>So they own like Ford debt, GM debt, United Airlines.</p>
<p>Commercial paper, that&rsquo;s called, yeah.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, commercial paper is sort of more very fast term, short term duration.</p>
<p>But like, how do you make a decision to start buying corporate bonds?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like buying corporate equities.</p>
<p>Do you buy Google versus Facebook?</p>
<p>Do you have a view?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the capital allocator making that decision?</p>
<p>So more importantly, who&rsquo;s setting the price?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s setting the price?</p>
<p>So, you know, these guys have been off the reservation for a long time.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that they were forced into action without a playbook in the middle of</p>
<p>a once in a lifetime, once a century pandemic.</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>And I think they actually did a pretty reasonable job.</p>
<p>But we just kept the tap on for so long.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re like dealing with this stuff, trying to figure out how do we actually compensate?</p>
<p>So the idea that we would add knowing all of this.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s one thing, I think, if Biden passed the bill, five months ago, six months ago,</p>
<p>because we didn&rsquo;t know any of this stuff.</p>
<p>But to do it now, knowing that, I think that it&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>And I bet you that it&rsquo;s not just Manchin on the Democrats that are having a little bit</p>
<p>of heartburn and second thoughts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably more because I suspect that they could have forced his hand, really,</p>
<p>if it was just up to him.</p>
<p>But I suspect there are other Democrats who are now teetering on the fence thinking,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want my legacy to be tied to this.</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re printing six, seven, 8% inflation, for me to basically keep the money printing</p>
<p>machine on because it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s insane.</p>
<p>This is like the Sopranos episode where he gave them like, he fronted the guy like 45</p>
<p>boxes of ziti.</p>
<p>And like, you wake up and this guy can&rsquo;t pay the bill on the poker game.</p>
<p>Like, where can we even afford to pay this back at some point?</p>
<p>Yeah, look, I think when when March comes around, and this bill supposedly going to</p>
<p>be brought back off the table, we&rsquo;re going to be into the election season in 2022.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know that Democrats are gonna want to defend this.</p>
<p>I think there is a view on the democratic side that if they deliver enough goodies to</p>
<p>their base, then that will help them win elections.</p>
<p>But I think what helps you win elections more than delivering goodies to your special interest</p>
<p>is for the economy to be healthy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And if they are sort of pressurizing this inflation situation, that is, I think, ultimately,</p>
<p>that could backfire.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s going to be worse for the economy.</p>
<p>Frankly, I think Manchin is doing Biden a favor, because if the economy does grow by</p>
<p>4% next year, as the Fed is predicting it is, and if inflation comes down, because you</p>
<p>stop printing money the way they&rsquo;re doing, then, you know, I think the Democrats will</p>
<p>do better in the election if the economy is good.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the reasons why they did so poorly, you know, in the off year election</p>
<p>a month ago, is that there&rsquo;s tremendous economic anxiety out there.</p>
<p>People are seeing the inflation at the gas tank when they go to buy food.</p>
<p>And, you know, if that continues, I think they&rsquo;re going to do very poorly next year.</p>
<p>I wanted to like bring up this chart from Fred on total assets on the Fed balance sheet.</p>
<p>I think it is really interesting to look at this thing.</p>
<p>Because so the Fed had about a trillion of assets until 2008.</p>
<p>Okay, then we had the financial crisis, and they doubled it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when the quantitative easing began.</p>
<p>I went to 2 trillion.</p>
<p>But then from roughly 2009, to about 2020, before COVID, somehow the balance sheet grew</p>
<p>from 2 trillion to 4 trillion.</p>
<p>So and it had gone to four and a half, and they were starting to shed assets.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re starting to get off drugs.</p>
<p>But it was still from two to 4 trillion between this like 2009 and 2020 period when supposedly</p>
<p>we weren&rsquo;t in a crisis.</p>
<p>So, you know, they&rsquo;ve continued this quantitative easing, then COVID hits.</p>
<p>And the amount grows from four to 7 trillion, just in 2020.</p>
<p>And since then, it&rsquo;s gone from seven to a little under 9 trillion.</p>
<p>Just in the last, you know, well, they</p>
<p>How do we get these things off our books ever?</p>
<p>I mean, these are 20 year bonds.</p>
<p>Eventually, you got to sell them.</p>
<p>Well, either they&rsquo;re gonna have to sell the assets.</p>
<p>Or they can&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s not like that they basically are the are the Fed is the one who bought</p>
<p>the government debt.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re buying is call it a 10 year Treasury.</p>
<p>So yeah, I guess they could just wait till the bond gets paid off.</p>
<p>But but I guess they could do that.</p>
<p>But but now that Fed has an incentive not to let the assets get toxic, right?</p>
<p>So if you know, the assets would get toxic, if you know, if interest rates go up too high,</p>
<p>that drives bond prices down.</p>
<p>And now all the assets in their books are worth a lot less.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is this is like the point where we have to just call it and say,</p>
<p>Okay, you know what, let&rsquo;s move on.</p>
<p>Meaning in the sense that, like, we have to go to these root causes, because the</p>
<p>money is more money is not going to fix what we&rsquo;re dealing with.</p>
<p>So I just put something in the group chat.</p>
<p>And I just want to get your guys&rsquo;s reaction to it.</p>
<p>Because when I saw it, it blew my mind.</p>
<p>There was a study, okay, that was just published a few days ago.</p>
<p>And it said the following thing.</p>
<p>Children born during the pandemic have experienced a catastrophic drop</p>
<p>in cognitive development of 22 IQ points.</p>
<p>And when you look at it, the people that were the most affected were</p>
<p>male children, and children of lower socioeconomic families.</p>
<p>But everybody was affected.</p>
<p>Yet you see the amount of money that we&rsquo;re spending already.</p>
<p>So adding more money to something is not going to make it better.</p>
<p>If what we&rsquo;re spending today is basically just getting flushed down the toilet.</p>
<p>And these are the kinds of things that really matter.</p>
<p>How do you allow an entire generation of kids to see to suffer?</p>
<p>By the way, what does that show?</p>
<p>That means that teachers actually are unbelievably important.</p>
<p>So number one, they should get paid a lot more.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s just put it out.</p>
<p>There should be more of them and smaller class sizes.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But if you if you have, you know, these completely screwed up incentives</p>
<p>between, you know, the organizations, the unions that represent these teachers,</p>
<p>and then the parents who have completely different incentives.</p>
<p>And they basically fight to never be in classroom and to not really teach.</p>
<p>This is the measurable outcome.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The IQ of our children.</p>
<p>I mean, we are pushing ability, their executive function, their scores are going down.</p>
<p>How do they recover from that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be a lot of tutoring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be a lot of summer school.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean,</p>
<p>Zoom&rsquo;s not gonna do it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think more Fortnite and Roblox fixes this problem.</p>
<p>No, definitely not.</p>
<p>And I feel terrible because like, you know, as a parent, that&rsquo;s that was my solution.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I was struggling with the zooms, like every other parent.</p>
<p>And then in the evenings, I was just so burnt and just feeling so</p>
<p>beside myself in the middle of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Whereas I had a no iPad rule for my kids that I broke down.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>You know, everybody did.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re home with your kids all day long.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not how it&rsquo;s supposed to work.</p>
<p>And so the point is, like, this is where the government should step in and actually say,</p>
<p>Okay, here, let me take leadership on this topic.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And talk to the unions, fix whatever needs to be fixed,</p>
<p>amp up the money into charter schools, do whatever you need to do.</p>
<p>But please fix the problem.</p>
<p>But randomly spending money to try to buy votes.</p>
<p>I think people see through that.</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And related to that Omicron is spreading like crazy.</p>
<p>New York City.</p>
<p>Omicron.</p>
<p>Omicron.</p>
<p>There is no N.</p>
<p>Omicron.</p>
<p>Omicron.</p>
<p>Omicron.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;ll learn how to pronounce it when it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>Omicron is spreading like crazy.</p>
<p>In New York City, and in the UK, amongst other places, the NBA and the NFL are seeing surges.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a ton of people I know test positive this week.</p>
<p>You guys had that?</p>
<p>Family, friends?</p>
<p>Crazy.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s insane how many people are.</p>
<p>I know so many people.</p>
<p>Related?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And a lot of people that don&rsquo;t have any symptoms.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the chart of cases, cases spiking, but hospitalizations and deaths.</p>
<p>Are flat or going down in places where these outbreaks are occurring.</p>
<p>The UK charts are even starker.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of anecdotal evidence.</p>
<p>Everybody on TikTok and Instagram and Twitter.</p>
<p>Young people in New York who went to SantaCon are saying they all got it.</p>
<p>But if you look at this chart.</p>
<p>What is SantaCon?</p>
<p>SantaCon is the worst holiday of the year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a time when a bunch of young people dress as Santa Claus and get drunk.</p>
<p>And you have 10,000 people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bar crawl.</p>
<p>Sexy Santa?</p>
<p>You see this?</p>
<p>You see how Monty&rsquo;s wearing his Santa outfit?</p>
<p>Oh, Monty Claus.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what goes on.</p>
<p>Everyone wears their little Santa outfit and they go bar crawling.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not Sexy Santa?</p>
<p>Well, actually, I have a story about that.</p>
<p>I was in San Francisco when I first moved up here.</p>
<p>You were Sexy Santa?</p>
<p>No, I literally took my daughters out for pizza.</p>
<p>Tony&rsquo;s in North Beach.</p>
<p>And, you know, I got my three daughters.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s all these people walking around.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Santa Claus.</p>
<p>Like a lot of them.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s 1,000 Santa Claus descend on North Beach.</p>
<p>And I turn around and I kid you not.</p>
<p>There are two old guys.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking 70 years old.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re wearing a baseball, a Santa hat.</p>
<p>Santa boots.</p>
<p>And nothing in between.</p>
<p>Literally buck naked on the street.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Bro, you&rsquo;re so demented, okay?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like this, like, unky perv.</p>
<p>Like, every time I get those text messages, I don&rsquo;t know what to think.</p>
<p>Did you guys click on the Twitter link when Jason was like,</p>
<p>guys, search for the Folsom Street Fair on Twitter?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t unsee what I saw.</p>
<p>I was like, why is Folsom Street trending?</p>
<p>I was like, I thought there was a terrorist attack.</p>
<p>Bro, that was so brutal.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t send that shit around.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s so brutal.</p>
<p>I was like, don&rsquo;t click on Folsom.</p>
<p>I was like, oh, this is a Twitter link.</p>
<p>What is it about?</p>
<p>Web 3.0?</p>
<p>Not exactly.</p>
<p>The Folsom Street Fair.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go ahead and say, don&rsquo;t search for that.</p>
<p>If you have kids around, it&rsquo;s a little bit intense.</p>
<p>But anyway, the SantaCon was on Saturday, December 11th.</p>
<p>And so here we are five days later, you know, four or five days later, and the stuff</p>
<p>hitting, if that&rsquo;s true, it almost perfectly mirrors the original outbreak</p>
<p>after St. Patty&rsquo;s Day in March 2020.</p>
<p>And if you look on social media, all the city MD lines,</p>
<p>where people get tested are around the block.</p>
<p>And 30 NBA players have entered the COVID protocol in the last two weeks,</p>
<p>about 7% of the league.</p>
<p>And we had a big question mark of would this be less, more contagious?</p>
<p>It obviously is, check.</p>
<p>Less deadly.</p>
<p>It apparently is.</p>
<p>Some studies show as much as 40 times more infectious than Delta.</p>
<p>Highly contagious, extreme, very much airborne.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going everywhere.</p>
<p>Like I said last time, if it does end up having low severity and low</p>
<p>hospitalization rate and low death rate for vaccinated or vaccinated plus boosted populations,</p>
<p>this could end up being a massive immunizing event,</p>
<p>meaning like a lot of people will develop new antibodies and resistance.</p>
<p>And that could be a net good thing.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s certainly the case that this is not a one strain, one shot and done pandemic.</p>
<p>This is an endemic kind of circumstance.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to be in this for a while.</p>
<p>And the circumstances are one that may require an adaptation in terms of</p>
<p>how we live and operate.</p>
<p>And especially as it relates to things that are so important,</p>
<p>like keeping businesses open in schools.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re going to use recent memory to guide future decision making,</p>
<p>or at least politicians and lawmakers will.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll say,</p>
<p>Hey, this is what we did last time this happened.</p>
<p>And we just saw this in California where they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>last time, like we told everyone going to lockdown or wear masks indoors again,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re seeing that behavior again.</p>
<p>Certainly, it may have an impact in terms of the spread,</p>
<p>but this is highly contagious, and it&rsquo;s going to spread everywhere.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s just some adaptation that maybe</p>
<p>is going to be needed here over the long run.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no end, there&rsquo;s no end in sight.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no end in sight, but it is less deadly.</p>
<p>And so it could be mass immunizing.</p>
<p>And that has led people to think of this herd immunity,</p>
<p>potentially, if there&rsquo;s not another variant,</p>
<p>sacks, if the NBA and the NFL are learning to live with COVID.</p>
<p>And obviously, when we were in Miami, there&rsquo;s no COVID.</p>
<p>And Austin, there&rsquo;s no COVID.</p>
<p>Yeah, is everybody now just go because it seems like the politicians now,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s in Europe, we&rsquo;re seeing the protests.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;ll see them here in the United States.</p>
<p>If this keeps up, Australia, obviously having protests as well.</p>
<p>The public has decided, I think, we&rsquo;re willing to have 1000 people die a day</p>
<p>or a certain number of people die today to get back to normal.</p>
<p>So what do you think the end game here is going into 2022?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make a prediction for 2022.</p>
<p>Okay, I will predict that even the blue areas of the country</p>
<p>are going to have fatigue with all these COVID restrictions.</p>
<p>And so even the blue state governors who are addicted to their state of emergencies</p>
<p>and their restrictions and lockdowns and closures and mask mandates,</p>
<p>even they are going to have to give them up in 2022</p>
<p>because the country is sick and tired of this.</p>
<p>Peter Pham had a really good tweet just the other day,</p>
<p>maybe you guys can dig it up, where he had a friend visit him from Texas.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve been living normally there since like July of 2020, roughly.</p>
<p>Kids in school, occasionally someone gets sick,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve been living normally, okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a manageable problem.</p>
<p>And he couldn&rsquo;t believe, Peter&rsquo;s friend could not believe how they&rsquo;re living in LA,</p>
<p>where still everyone&rsquo;s living in fear.</p>
<p>We now have a new one-month indoor mask mandate,</p>
<p>thanks to Governor Newsom, who still is ruling the state of emergency.</p>
<p>What good is that going to do?</p>
<p>But I think that some of these blue areas, people are so petrified still of the virus.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s just because of,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the ones who have been ingesting all this fear porn coming from the media.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s going to break.</p>
<p>I think finally this hysteria and panic will break,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll crest over the blue parts of the country in 2022.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re already back to normal in the red parts.</p>
<p>And especially Omicron, you can&rsquo;t stop this, okay?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the salient point here.</p>
<p>Nothing works.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re all going to get it.</p>
<p>Look, the little stupid vax card that you have to</p>
<p>show everywhere to get like popcorn at a movie theater, like in San Francisco,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t do anything because vaccinated people can spread it too.</p>
<p>So that doesn&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>And the mask mandate doesn&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>You know, and so none of this stuff does anything except</p>
<p>getting a vaccine reduces the severity of the illness.</p>
<p>And losing weight.</p>
<p>And we can&rsquo;t have that conversation.</p>
<p>Those consequences are mainly on the person who decides to do it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we have to say is we have to tell everybody, you know, listen,</p>
<p>lose weight, get in shape, eat healthy, get vaccinated, get back to life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best you can do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m I believe everybody&rsquo;s going to get it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re starting to see like a real divergence in American life where and I think Omicron,</p>
<p>if we have lockdowns under Omicron, and really the big issue is school closures.</p>
<p>If we go back to school closures in blue states and have more of the learning loss</p>
<p>that Chamath was talking about, and I bet we do, whereas in red states,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re still out there learning normally and they&rsquo;re dealing with it,</p>
<p>just like they deal with the outbreak of a flu season or cold season.</p>
<p>But they, you know, they&rsquo;re just managing it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna there&rsquo;s gonna be we&rsquo;re gonna be living in two different Americas.</p>
<p>But I but I don&rsquo;t believe this is sustainable.</p>
<p>I think eventually, these governors who are holding on to their power,</p>
<p>and their restrictions are going to lose in 2022.</p>
<p>The ones who haven&rsquo;t given it up are gonna are gonna basically fall to a red wave in November</p>
<p>22.</p>
<p>I think NUSA might be the only one left.</p>
<p>Any schools closed?</p>
<p>I see everybody&rsquo;s cancelling their Christmas parties.</p>
<p>JP Morgan cancelled that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re close.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re close.</p>
<p>Every Christmas party has been getting cancelled.</p>
<p>And I wonder if schools, I mean, teachers unions, they got to be having a meeting right now.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t even the teachers don&rsquo;t even acknowledge that learning loss exists.</p>
<p>I mean, this is why I decided to homeschool for the year of the pandemic.</p>
<p>And I kept my homeschool teacher for, you know, a couple of hours a day.</p>
<p>And my kids have done wonderfully.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s great to have the ability to afford to be able to do that.</p>
<p>But not everybody can have an after school tutor.</p>
<p>Let me uplevel this for a second.</p>
<p>Okay, so I&rsquo;m spilling the beans on one of my predictions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make it the predictions episode we do.</p>
<p>But first, we had COVID.</p>
<p>Okay, then we had the overreaction to COVID, both politically and economically.</p>
<p>Economically, we pumped 10 trillion plus of spending and monetary and QE and all this sort</p>
<p>of stuff.</p>
<p>Politically, we had these restrictions, school closures, lockdowns, mandates.</p>
<p>Okay, I think we&rsquo;re about to enter a new phase, which is the correction to the overreaction.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re already in the correction.</p>
<p>So the market&rsquo;s been correcting, gross stocks been correcting for the last five or six weeks.</p>
<p>I now think that there was a bit of a political correction with Youngkin winning in Virginia.</p>
<p>Remember, that state swung 10 points relative to a year ago.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;ll see a further correction, both political and economic in 2022.</p>
<p>So we may not be completely past COVID.</p>
<p>But I think we are going to be past this sort of overreaction to COVID.</p>
<p>What do you guys think about Succession?</p>
<p>Oh, no, I haven&rsquo;t seen it.</p>
<p>Jeremy Strong.</p>
<p>Jeremy Strong.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the Jeremy Strong thing.</p>
<p>Jeremy Strong.</p>
<p>Okay, Jeremy Strong is a weirdo, according to a New Yorker profile.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s been a huge response to it.</p>
<p>This profile came out.</p>
<p>This is Kendall.</p>
<p>Kendall Roy on Succession.</p>
<p>Kendall Roy, who is woke, and dumb, and ineffective as an executive.</p>
<p>And obviously, the show is modeled after Rupert Murdoch and Fox and the kids there who are not</p>
<p>dopey, actually.</p>
<p>In the article, it hinted that most of Succession&rsquo;s co workers dislike him due to his intensity</p>
<p>and method acting rituals.</p>
<p>He won&rsquo;t rehearse with anybody.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in character all the time, like Daniel Day-Lewis.</p>
<p>He won&rsquo;t get makeup whenever anybody else does, because he doesn&rsquo;t want to reduce the</p>
<p>energy and the buildup.</p>
<p>The article notes, there is a fine line that Strong walks between being a legendary method</p>
<p>actor and just a completely awesome networker.</p>
<p>Wait, can I tell you why this story was interesting to me and why I sent this to you guys?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so here&rsquo;s a guy who, in many ways, is a virtuoso.</p>
<p>And the reason, I mean, he&rsquo;s a really good actor, because I despise Kendall Roy on that</p>
<p>show.</p>
<p>And I was wondering, like, is this guy just a terrible actor?</p>
<p>Or is he such a good actor that I hate them?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I hate him.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I was attracted to this article and in it or after it.</p>
<p>So basically, what happens is, he&rsquo;s a virtuoso, just and I&rsquo;ll come back to it in a second.</p>
<p>These people at the New Yorker, who I guess are just jealous or want to write clickbait,</p>
<p>try to destroy this guy.</p>
<p>But what they didn&rsquo;t factor is that when they publish this article, all these other actors</p>
<p>would come to his defense and do it really publicly.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Aaron Sorkin wrote a letter.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That Jessica Chastain published to Twitter, because Aaron Sorkin doesn&rsquo;t have access to</p>
<p>social media by design.</p>
<p>And in all of it, they said, this is the most incredible person we&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>Aaron Sorkin says this guy is as good as Dustin Hoffman, which is like, this is&hellip;</p>
<p>As good as it gets.</p>
<p>So why was it interesting to me?</p>
<p>You have these people who are grinding and trying to perfect their craft, be a virtuoso.</p>
<p>You talked about Steph Curry grinding, try to perfect his craft.</p>
<p>Just a little Steph Curry story as a tangent.</p>
<p>He brought in this team where they basically started to map out all of the circumferences</p>
<p>of the ring, of the net.</p>
<p>And he practiced this summer, literally trying to get it perfectly in to create this very</p>
<p>specific kind of swish.</p>
<p>And he just kept shooting and shooting and shooting and shooting, not all the time, but</p>
<p>every day for some number of shots, trying to get the ball perfectly into the basket.</p>
<p>That is a level of perfectionism.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s being a virtuoso that none of us can really appreciate, but you see the output</p>
<p>and we all love it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s already the GOAT and he&rsquo;s trying to outdo himself.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a different guy in a completely different theater, in this case, acting, trying to also</p>
<p>be really legendary and putting himself through all kinds of stuff and still not lose himself</p>
<p>in it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So much so that all of these other people will really appreciate how amazing he is.</p>
<p>And to me, what I don&rsquo;t like is that then these critics who don&rsquo;t do anything, who&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never accomplished anything at all in their lives, feel so triggered that they have to</p>
<p>judge them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to not have that skill.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never be as good of an actor as Jeremy Strong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never be as good of a basketball player as Steph, but I don&rsquo;t hate these people for</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so happy that people like this exist, but there&rsquo;s a strain of people that exist.</p>
<p>And then you also have a, and then you also have a platform.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was about to connect the dots for you is like, look at, yeah.</p>
<p>Look at how the politicians feel the same way about private market.</p>
<p>Politicians, social media.</p>
<p>Who decide to try to destroy people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So instead what these people do is they take a shortcut.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the critics.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not in the arena.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The folks in the arena are booking wins and losses constantly.</p>
<p>But you have this, you have this strain of impotent critic that doesn&rsquo;t actually know</p>
<p>how to do for themselves.</p>
<p>And they somehow have a platform.</p>
<p>And then what they end up doing is cutting corners.</p>
<p>And then some subset of those start to cheat.</p>
<p>Cue David.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, it&rsquo;s a story that Congress back in 2012 passed a bill called the stock act</p>
<p>to prohibit members of Congress from trading on their insider knowledge based on, you know,</p>
<p>based on legislative actions are about to take.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been widely flouted by dozens of, you know, representatives and senators.</p>
<p>And the problem is there&rsquo;s no punishment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something like a $200 fine or something like that, that gets waived in most of these</p>
<p>cases.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s completely hypocritical because these are the, these politicians like Senator Karen,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re constantly demonizing and attacking other people to make themselves look better.</p>
<p>And then here they are, they&rsquo;ve got dirty hands.</p>
<p>And they asked Pelosi, they said to Pelosi, well, don&rsquo;t you think that members of Congress</p>
<p>should be prohibited from trading stocks, right?</p>
<p>Because their actions have such a huge consequence on them.</p>
<p>And Pelosi said, no, it&rsquo;s a free market.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a free market.</p>
<p>We should be free to do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, huh?</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t remember that being a defense.</p>
<p>Every time you&rsquo;ve wanted to regulate some, you know, industry that doesn&rsquo;t the president</p>
<p>have to divest when they take the presidential office?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that a divest?</p>
<p>Or they put they put their assets in a blind trust.</p>
<p>Yeah, so they&rsquo;re blind.</p>
<p>So why would senators, Congress, totally people be any different?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absurd that elected officials should be able to engage in insider trading.</p>
<p>It makes no sense.</p>
<p>The Fed actually had this issue as well.</p>
<p>Two folks on the Federal Reserve Board resigned.</p>
<p>And then Powell issued a whole bunch of, I think, new laws or regulations inside the Fed</p>
<p>to try to fix it.</p>
<p>And the same issue occurs with federal judges.</p>
<p>And there are federal judges that are consistently trading</p>
<p>in the equities of the companies that are in front of them.</p>
<p>And so how can you adjudicate a case?</p>
<p>There was one judge that had 130 plus conflicts, trading conflicts.</p>
<p>130 plus, and he is the one that&rsquo;s there where AT&amp;T or Facebook or Google has an issue.</p>
<p>I mean, how can you actually assume that these folks are being impartial if that&rsquo;s the case?</p>
<p>And there are no consequences for this.</p>
<p>And yet, you know, if you&rsquo;re again, going back to where we started,</p>
<p>somebody in the arena trying to do something, you just got to think yourself like you have</p>
<p>critics that are bashing you, you have folks that are basically flouting the law because</p>
<p>they can.</p>
<p>And then you put these two together.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, this is so it&rsquo;s kind of depressing, to be honest with you, you start to lose a</p>
<p>little bit of faith.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest.</p>
<p>I mean, this, these politicians are grifters.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And full stop.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re just grifting.</p>
<p>And I mean, except for apparently, except for Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren,</p>
<p>they should just buy the companies they hate.</p>
<p>Why aren&rsquo;t they buying Amazon and Tesla, they would be total proponents of Jeff Bezos and</p>
<p>Elon Musk if they did.</p>
<p>Yeah, in fairness to Warren, I&rsquo;ve seen her tweet that she supports the banning of the</p>
<p>insider trading by congressional representatives.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t exactly see her fighting for it.</p>
<p>You know, as hard as she&rsquo;s denouncing people like Elon.</p>
<p>So, look, I mean, it&rsquo;s characteristic of elected officials that they, what is it they see the</p>
<p>splinter, you know, in somebody, you know, in somebody else&rsquo;s eye, but not the log in</p>
<p>their own or something like that.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that the expression?</p>
<p>But you know, who&rsquo;s taking advantage of this issue is Blake Masters, who&rsquo;s running for</p>
<p>Senate in Arizona just tweeted about that this would be the first thing he would fix</p>
<p>if he gets elected, which is to ban insider trading by elected officials.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s remarkable that, you know, politicians as shrewd as Nancy Pelosi are</p>
<p>just ceding this issue to Republicans.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know why Republicans wouldn&rsquo;t make this a major plank of their platform</p>
<p>for 2022.</p>
<p>Nancy Pelosi is, I think, the third or fourth richest person in Congress.</p>
<p>Her husband is a very sophisticated private equity investor.</p>
<p>There are these meme stocks that follow Nancy Pelosi&rsquo;s stock trading account or pretend</p>
<p>to that were, you know, recently, by the way, banned by Twitter, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Protecting her.</p>
<p>Protecting her effectively.</p>
<p>So, you know, she has an incentive to not.</p>
<p>Her seat of power is not necessarily the salary that she earns by being house leader, but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s by translating that in a bunch of different ways.</p>
<p>And one way, apparently, it turns out is being an active equity investor in the market.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s allowed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how this isn&rsquo;t just like an A plus fantastic issue for Republicans.</p>
<p>They should make it an absolute plank of their platform.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Florida Republican Brian Mast was late in disclosing purchase of up to 100,000 in stock</p>
<p>at an aerospace company, which had just testified before our committee.</p>
<p>He said Kentucky Republican Rand Paul was 16 months late disclosing that he bought</p>
<p>his wife bought stock in a pharma company that manufactures an antiviral COVID-19 treatment.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Nevada Democrat Susie Lee failed to probably disclose more than 200 trades.</p>
<p>Yeah, just as much as three million.</p>
<p>I mean, this is just to be clear.</p>
<p>The violations have been on both sides of the aisle.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not at all trying to say that Republicans are better on this than Democrats.</p>
<p>However, this is good bipartisan cooperation.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>This is the political class in Washington engaging in bad behavior.</p>
<p>But the difference is this, which is that Pelosi, the only leader of a party I&rsquo;ve heard</p>
<p>defend this is Pelosi.</p>
<p>And I think this is a fantastic issue for outsider candidates, really on both sides</p>
<p>to run on.</p>
<p>This is also something that Biden can take because Biden has never tried to do this stuff.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Biden&rsquo;s got so many shady dealings and concepts.</p>
<p>Are you talking about his kid?</p>
<p>Selling paintings to China?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of rich Bidens out there.</p>
<p>Apparently, he&rsquo;s got a rich brother.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a hunter who&rsquo;s been paid a lot of money.</p>
<p>No, maybe that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>But Joe Biden has been really down the middle.</p>
<p>Come on, be fair.</p>
<p>Hunter&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s selling paintings.</p>
<p>Yeah, but why are they buying Hunter Biden paintings for five hundred thousand dollars?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, he&rsquo;s a great artist.</p>
<p>I mean, why do people buy?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you saw Melania&rsquo;s coming out with NFTs today.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s a lot of security.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s securing the bag now.</p>
<p>I mean, and by the way, the presidential grift is always the best.</p>
<p>Just as a case in point, Trump&rsquo;s SPAC is worth over two billion.</p>
<p>And BuzzFeed, which makes three hundred sixty million a year,</p>
<p>and I think has one hundred, two hundred million in cash.</p>
<p>Yeah, but he&rsquo;s not in office.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not in office.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s misstated, Jason.</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s SPAC, his shares that he&rsquo;s going to be receiving are worth close to 20 billion.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>20 billion.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s not in office anymore.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>The shares that he&rsquo;s going to receive.</p>
<p>Oh, in the future.</p>
<p>Yeah, what you&rsquo;re counting is the market cap of the cash and trust</p>
<p>the value of the shares that are already public in the SPAC.</p>
<p>The Trump, the value of the Trump entity is going to be closer to 20 billion.</p>
<p>Oh, is that right?</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s even crazier with no revenue.</p>
<p>These poor media people.</p>
<p>Well, the SEC, apparently the DOJ sent a bunch of inquiries on this asking</p>
<p>for background on the transaction because there&rsquo;s no business,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no contracts, there&rsquo;s no employees.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a whole idea.</p>
<p>But by the way, just to make sure that everybody understands this,</p>
<p>this is a bipartisan thing as well.</p>
<p>The ultimate bag secures, the Obamas got, I think, 50 million plus each for their book deals.</p>
<p>And they got supposedly high eight figures like 50, 60, 70, $80 million from Netflix.</p>
<p>Sorry, hold on a second.</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>When you said when you call them bag secures, I was really triggered there for a second.</p>
<p>So am I supposed to take that offensively that you&rsquo;re saying Michelle Obama and</p>
<p>Barack Obama secured the bag?</p>
<p>Secured the bag is a term for getting the money.</p>
<p>The Obamas are doing it, the Clintons did it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a thing.</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s doing it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a thing.</p>
<p>Secure the bag.</p>
<p>But Jason, we&rsquo;re not against everybody not being able to make money.</p>
<p>The issue is trading on your office in a way that where you are trading on your insider</p>
<p>information that your office has given you.</p>
<p>Sure, but I mean, here-</p>
<p>Or if you&rsquo;re selling influence.</p>
<p>If you sell a book, hold on a second, if you sell a book when you&rsquo;re out of office,</p>
<p>is that really a problem?</p>
<p>Is that the same thing?</p>
<p>I wanted to point out the Netflix one.</p>
<p>What was Netflix&rsquo;s existential crisis for the eight years Obama was in office?</p>
<p>Anybody remember?</p>
<p>Nobody remembers?</p>
<p>Net neutrality.</p>
<p>Nobody cares.</p>
<p>Could they get, would they have to pay Verizon?</p>
<p>What was the Obamas position on net neutrality?</p>
<p>They were for net neutrality.</p>
<p>Netflix stock went up 40, 50x under Obama.</p>
<p>It could all be a coincidence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying.</p>
<p>What the fuck?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s a disguised lobbying payment to Obama?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like, are you serious?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like-</p>
<p>You are out of your mind.</p>
<p>I mean, listen, the Clintons were doing speaking gigs for Goldman Sachs at half a million dollars.</p>
<p>This is kind of my cue to go to dinner now.</p>
<p>Okay, here&rsquo;s the MRA.</p>
<p>You know, the main way that Winston Churchill supported himself was writing books.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s okay for politicians to write books and if, because ultimately the public</p>
<p>buys them and that&rsquo;s how they make money.</p>
<p>What about when the book is 50 million and the normal price would be 10?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I guess you might have a point.</p>
<p>If the advance was so in excess of the expected sales that it raises a question of what the</p>
<p>real motive is for the payment.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But is that what happened?</p>
<p>Nobody gets paid a 50 million dollar advance.</p>
<p>Nobody gets an eight-figure deal who&rsquo;s never made a documentary before.</p>
<p>I mean, if this book sold 5 million copies, it still wouldn&rsquo;t be worth it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move on to MRNA so we keep our Friedberg factor high.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so ready to go to dinner.</p>
<p>Rick Thompson gave me a wonderful bottle of wine, by the way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go drink it tonight.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so super tilted that you like, it&rsquo;s like, I mean, I criticize the Obamas.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t deal with it.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t deal with it.</p>
<p>No fly zone for you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m super tilted.</p>
<p>I mean, this is worse than sweater care.</p>
<p>Well, what about the Clintons?</p>
<p>Can I, can I go after their 500 days speaking gigs from Goldman Sachs?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, fine.</p>
<p>Just don&rsquo;t touch the Obamas.</p>
<p>But I mean, Jason, are you, are you doing exactly what Senator Karen did to Elon,</p>
<p>which is by virtue of the fact that they&rsquo;re making money that you are now imputing evil</p>
<p>motives to it?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s just a disproportionate to what they should get by your assessment.</p>
<p>Their assessment&rsquo;s the same about Elon.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d pay a lot of money for Michelle Obama to do much of any.</p>
<p>I think she&rsquo;s just a figure for somebody who&rsquo;s never made a film on for Netflix.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it makes sense.</p>
<p>You said the same thing about Rivian.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, man.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re projecting a little bit.</p>
<p>I totally agree.</p>
<p>This is on the second floor.</p>
<p>I jump out the window right now.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let winners be winners.</p>
<p>I think we should differentiate between insider trading.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Bad and should not be allowed.</p>
<p>Influence peddling.</p>
<p>Bad should not be allowed.</p>
<p>And somebody out of office making money.</p>
<p>Monetizing their influence?</p>
<p>Well, no, no, no, not monetizing their influence.</p>
<p>And if they did that, that&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>Getting paid for services is fine.</p>
<p>Getting paid to sell tickets or books.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s if that&rsquo;s what it is, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Unless it&rsquo;s disproportionate to the reality.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put it in, put it in, put it in, put it in, MRNA.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Jason, say you like the Obamas.</p>
<p>I would vote Obama in for a third term.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t you get paid a $50,000 speaking fee recently to speak at a conference?</p>
<p>He did.</p>
<p>I get paid all the time, but not worth that.</p>
<p>Overpaid, overpaid, overpaid.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re worth $8.50 in a fucking Subway sandwich.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re worth like $2,500.</p>
<p>I just got paid $15,000 to do a 15-minute speaking gig.</p>
<p>Who are you trying to influence?</p>
<p>Who are they paying you to influence, J. Cal?</p>
<p>I mean, honestly, J. Cal.</p>
<p>I have no influence.</p>
<p>Jason, Jason, you&rsquo;re worth like 30% less than a high-end escort.</p>
<p>Okay, no offense.</p>
<p>Oh, man, that&rsquo;s expensive.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, what&rsquo;s 30% more than 50?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s saying it&rsquo;s like 80 grand.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, 60, 70 grand.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize that.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Talk to us about the MRNA news for cancer, Freiberg.</p>
<p>That came out this past week.</p>
<p>So I think the article that you guys sent around was one related to</p>
<p>an oncology treatment that uses MRNA tech, but I think it&rsquo;s what I wanted to kind of,</p>
<p>what I thought would be interesting to talk about for a second is just zooming out</p>
<p>on MRNA technology as a whole, which has been theorized for&hellip;</p>
<p>The potential of it has been talked about for 50 years.</p>
<p>If we talk about, real quick, what RNA is&hellip;</p>
<p>Remember, your DNA, your genetic code defines the printing of proteins in your cells.</p>
<p>And so, every three letters of DNA is an amino acid, a bunch of amino acids in a row,</p>
<p>form a protein, and that protein has some function in your body.</p>
<p>The way that the DNA gets translated into protein is through these MRNA snippets.</p>
<p>So, a little snippet of RNA is a copy of DNA, which floats over from the DNA strand,</p>
<p>and it floats into what&rsquo;s called the ribosome.</p>
<p>And the ribosome is the protein printer in the cell.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s lots of ribosomes, and there&rsquo;s lots of RNA floating around all the time,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s being copied over.</p>
<p>So, some chemical triggers the expression of that gene, of that sequence of DNA into RNA</p>
<p>that then turns into protein.</p>
<p>And so, a chemical induces the protein.</p>
<p>Then the protein does something interesting.</p>
<p>And the protein has a function in your body.</p>
<p>And some of those proteins in human body can do bad things and some of them can do good things.</p>
<p>And so, the idea has always been that we can actually use proteins as a way to modulate</p>
<p>our health and modulate disease.</p>
<p>For example, creating a protein that can attach to cancer cells and signal immune</p>
<p>cells to come and kill those cancer cells, as an example.</p>
<p>And some people have genetic problems where their DNA prints the wrong protein.</p>
<p>And then that protein is malformed or causes some harm to your health.</p>
<p>And so, the idea for RNA technology has always been that instead of</p>
<p>having DNA be the source of truth for the proteins that get expressed in your body,</p>
<p>can we stick RNA directly into cells and use that RNA to trigger the production of</p>
<p>proteins that can do specific things in your body?</p>
<p>And remember, the biggest segment of the pharma market or a huge segment of the pharma market</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s called biologic drugs, which are largely antibodies, which are a type of protein</p>
<p>that have some specific function.</p>
<p>But very many of these proteins are hard to get into the body and get them into the right</p>
<p>place and get them to do the things we want them to do.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;d be a lot easier if we could get RNA into the right cells to get those cells to</p>
<p>make the right protein to do that thing that we want them to do.</p>
<p>So, everything from cancer treatment to genetic diseases and there&rsquo;s RNA interference and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s RNA or what are called oligonucleotides that can be used to block specific bad proteins</p>
<p>from being produced in your cells or it&rsquo;s kind of another kind of course of treatment.</p>
<p>So, making proteins that we think are therapeutic and blocking the production of bad proteins</p>
<p>are kind of the mainstay of this idea behind RNA technology.</p>
<p>And Moderna was started to pursue this effort at a flagship pioneering, which is an incubation</p>
<p>shop in Boston.</p>
<p>And they really kind of struggled for years to find the right footing of what&rsquo;s the right</p>
<p>business model and the right product and the FDA kind of struggled with approving this</p>
<p>stuff.</p>
<p>And then boom, COVID hit.</p>
<p>And when COVID hit, it was like, holy crap, let&rsquo;s accelerate this RNA technology, use</p>
<p>it for vaccines, which had been in development for years.</p>
<p>And the protein that&rsquo;s being produced is the same protein you find on the SARS-CoV-2 virus,</p>
<p>which triggers an immune response and builds up your immunity to that virus.</p>
<p>And now, the floodgates are open.</p>
<p>And this is incredible because the frontiers in RNA over the next decade could change the</p>
<p>course of how we treat disease and change the course of outcomes for many diseases from</p>
<p>genetic diseases all the way through to cancers.</p>
<p>And so, we&rsquo;re starting to see those floodgates open.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s now a few, a handful of these, you know, RNA interference products that have</p>
<p>been approved by the FDA.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re now starting to see many more of these cancer and immunotherapy drugs start</p>
<p>to get approved as RNA therapies.</p>
<p>But it really, I think, was lit by the breakthrough with COVID and everyone kind of seeing the</p>
<p>benefit of this and the lack of side effects.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve now got, I think, a validation in the market and acceptance from consumers that</p>
<p>this technology could transform the industry in the same way that Genentech transformed</p>
<p>the pharma industry with biologic drugs in the 80s and 90s.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s super exciting.</p>
<p>And, you know, we can do updates regularly on our show if you guys want to talk about</p>
<p>more of the cool stuff that&rsquo;s coming out.</p>
<p>But man, this is going to transform how medicine is delivered and the potential of things that</p>
<p>we can kind of treat.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a question.</p>
<p>Would the, if we looked at the total number of deaths from COVID, and then the potential</p>
<p>death, you know, deaths avoided or early deaths or more life days added, however you want</p>
<p>to do it, from mRNA and the impact on cancer over the next, say, 30 or 40 years, in other</p>
<p>words, the impact it would have on the people living today who live through COVID, do you</p>
<p>think net net, we&rsquo;ll see that the prevention of cancers through this new technology could</p>
<p>actually make, you know, basically the silver lining to what happened during COVID?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>Let me give you the counterpoint.</p>
<p>In the late 90s, there was a gene editing clinical trial that took place.</p>
<p>And they tried to, and a patient and they delivered the gene editing technology via</p>
<p>virus.</p>
<p>And so, the virus goes in, it spreads around and it has this molecule that would edit the</p>
<p>gene and it was for genetic disease.</p>
<p>And a patient that they gave it to, a young guy, got this virus and he actually died from</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And they shut down all clinical trials for years.</p>
<p>And it was like, boom, that&rsquo;s the end.</p>
<p>So, there are a lot of scientists, a lot of doctors have argued for years that that particular</p>
<p>case caused so many lives to be lost because we lost years of progress in being able to</p>
<p>run clinical trials during that time and get drugs to market that could treat people.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right, maybe the opposite has happened here.</p>
<p>That while these clinical trials may have taken years and years and years to get through</p>
<p>in a normal setting, perhaps the pandemic was the accelerant we needed to get more of</p>
<p>these to market faster and millions of people whose lives would have been lost or would</p>
<p>be lost otherwise to cancer and other genetic diseases and so on over the years to come</p>
<p>will be saved because these therapies will get to market faster.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, it&rsquo;s a great point.</p>
<p>And maybe I don&rsquo;t know what the calculus is between the lives lost in the pandemic versus</p>
<p>the lives gained via these treatments coming to market faster, but it&rsquo;s certainly a good</p>
<p>way to think about it.</p>
<p>The way to look at it, we can look at the days of life lost, right?</p>
<p>And if we actually could actually predict how long someone&rsquo;s gonna live.</p>
<p>And that, you know, extension of life, I think we can come out of this ahead.</p>
<p>Finally, on our docket, London Bree calls for better policing in San Francisco after</p>
<p>this insane surge in crime.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the video.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s time that the reign of criminals who are destroying our city, it is time for</p>
<p>it to come to an end.</p>
<p>And it comes to an end when we take the steps to be more aggressive with law enforcement,</p>
<p>more aggressive with the changes in our policies and less tolerant of all the bullshit that</p>
<p>has destroyed our city.</p>
<p>We are going to turn this around.</p>
<p>This is a city that has a population of less than 1 million people with an over $12 billion</p>
<p>budget.</p>
<p>The residents of this city have been extremely generous in providing us with the resources</p>
<p>we need to make a difference.</p>
<p>And now the priorities we need to make must be to protect them, must be to turn things</p>
<p>around in their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>When you are in a room full of people, I would say probably anywhere between 90 and</p>
<p>95 percent of folks could raise their hand and say that either their car has been breaking</p>
<p>into broken into or they&rsquo;ve been a victim in some capacity or another.</p>
<p>That is not OK.</p>
<p>That is not acceptable.</p>
<p>Saks, I thought crime was down and that everything was great and that we were going to defund</p>
<p>the police.</p>
<p>What is happening here?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the big turnaround?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s exactly what I was saying, that first of all, I loved it.</p>
<p>I love what she said.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;ve been saying for the last year.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really great to hear her say the same types of things.</p>
<p>I started this campaign back in January after New Year&rsquo;s Eve.</p>
<p>You had those two women get killed by a repeat offender who was released by Chase Boudin.</p>
<p>And then as I dug into it, I saw that he was doing this all the time as part of his agenda</p>
<p>of decarceration.</p>
<p>So and, you know, a year later, like we&rsquo;ve talked about throughout this whole time, the</p>
<p>city is totally degenerated into some sort of dystopian Gotham-like city.</p>
<p>This did feel like the beginning of a Batman movie.</p>
<p>I mean, it was a strong statement.</p>
<p>I thought it was great.</p>
<p>This is just the beginning of what needs to be done.</p>
<p>I predict that London Breed is going to eventually butt heads with Chase Boudin.</p>
<p>There is no way that he will support this agenda of fixing the city.</p>
<p>She wants to increase the police presence.</p>
<p>So like you said, she is going to refund the police, not defund the police.</p>
<p>Chase Boudin is, I mean, the only people he&rsquo;s passionate about prosecuting are police officers.</p>
<p>So we have a huge problem that the police department is actually, we have too few of</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re understaffed.</p>
<p>We take that job.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just because of budget.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also because they&rsquo;re demoralized and they&rsquo;ve got, you know, they&rsquo;ve got this prosecutor.</p>
<p>By the way, there was a case just recently where a repeat offender bashed a vodka ball</p>
<p>over the head of a cop.</p>
<p>And Chase just announced that he&rsquo;s getting sent to mental health diversion instead of</p>
<p>being prosecuted.</p>
<p>I want to post this.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You can attack a cop and not go to jail in the city of San Francisco?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>This is why the cops are demoralized.</p>
<p>So in order for London Breed to fix the problem, she is going, and I think she&rsquo;s on the right</p>
<p>track here.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got to go.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s my prediction.</p>
<p>On February 15th, they are having the recall election for the education board.</p>
<p>And I predict that that board, at least two of the three are going to be recalled.</p>
<p>The parents are sick and tired of it.</p>
<p>They are going to be out.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s going to embolden London Breed to then support the recall of Jason Boudin</p>
<p>in the June election.</p>
<p>And, and I think between that,</p>
<p>And she gets to pick as a replacement.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what she&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>She basically flipped.</p>
<p>She was quiet up until this point.</p>
<p>And now the progressive left are slowly eating themselves.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think this is self preservation, right?</p>
<p>Chamath.</p>
<p>I mean, if she didn&rsquo;t make a change here, she&rsquo;s going to be out of office, too.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;ll get recalled.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not self preservation.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re realizing that these policies don&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Moral absolutism didn&rsquo;t work on the left or the right.</p>
<p>These guys have tried in a small scale to do what a certain fraction of the Democratic</p>
<p>Party has been trying to do at a national level.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Overspending, under policing, under educating.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t do anything there.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s going to be a schism.</p>
<p>I think it started after the young convictory in Virginia.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s going to accelerate throughout for the next year.</p>
<p>And especially after the red wave in November 2022, there&rsquo;s going to be a schism between</p>
<p>liberal pragmatists and these extreme radical progressives.</p>
<p>I think London Breed represents.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s obviously very liberal, but I think she&rsquo;s pragmatic.</p>
<p>I think she wants to find solutions that work.</p>
<p>Whereas Chasen Boudin is a radical ideologue who will never change, no matter how much</p>
<p>evidence is presented to him, those policies don&rsquo;t work and are backfiring.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a simple formula.</p>
<p>The person who gets you into the mess is likely not the right person to get you out of the</p>
<p>mess.</p>
<p>And she talks about San Francisco having a $12 billion a year budget.</p>
<p>Can you guys imagine if she was the CEO of a tech company that had $12 billion a year</p>
<p>in OPEX, and she ran the business into the ground, would the board say, go ahead, turn</p>
<p>it around?</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>The board would step in.</p>
<p>And in this case, the board is the citizens of San Francisco.</p>
<p>And they would say, let&rsquo;s find the right person to turn this thing around.</p>
<p>And while she stood up and said the right things, and maybe it would echo.</p>
<p>And I think even if it echoes within David Sachs&rsquo;s heart, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s echoing in a</p>
<p>lot of hearts of more liberal San Franciscans.</p>
<p>But I think that the apathy, being asleep at the wheel, and allowing the disorganization</p>
<p>across the departments within that city is ultimately her responsibility.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that any amount of, you know, verbiage or action she might take at</p>
<p>this point justifies the damage she has caused while being the leader of that city.</p>
<p>And I think that you&rsquo;ll&hellip;</p>
<p>And by the way, I think you&rsquo;ll see to Sachs&rsquo;s point earlier, I think you&rsquo;ll see the same</p>
<p>response across the nation, where folks feel like the leaders that got them into the mess</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re in locally, in cities and elsewhere around this country, are going to vote those</p>
<p>folks out of office, because they want to change.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the same reason we saw folks vote Trump into office and the same reason we saw</p>
<p>folks vote Trump out of office.</p>
<p>The more you want to see a change, the more you&rsquo;re going to make a change with your political</p>
<p>electorate.</p>
<p>Friedberg is so, so right.</p>
<p>There is a phenomenal Twitter account.</p>
<p>His name is Rob Henderson.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like a PhD student right now.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s in Europe on scholarship.</p>
<p>You know, this guy has an incredible background, which you can talk about later.</p>
<p>But Rob Henderson has this thing, which I love, which is that, you know, a lot of this</p>
<p>stuff is born out of what he calls luxury beliefs, right?</p>
<p>Like defunding the police is a luxury belief.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like this rich, middle class, cloistered person that can sit behind a gate, have armed</p>
<p>security, yada, yada, yada, because you&rsquo;re not living in the ghetto where the byproducts</p>
<p>of the byproduct of defunding the police are born out or decarceration are born out.</p>
<p>Or, you know, if you send your kid to a private school, you can completely be for all these</p>
<p>crazy radical ideas like defunding, you know, advanced placement, defunding the gifted program,</p>
<p>because if your kid&rsquo;s smart, you&rsquo;ll just pay for a tutor and you can do whatever you want.</p>
<p>Those luxury beliefs exist more in the progressive left in such a small cohort of people than in any</p>
<p>other political class that we have in America.</p>
<p>And when they get a hold of power, they&rsquo;ve now had the right to show whether those luxury</p>
<p>beliefs can actually work.</p>
<p>The data says it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Okay, with competence.</p>
<p>I mean, how about that?</p>
<p>Like, just keep people safe and make the education luxury beliefs belong in</p>
<p>sociology textbooks in anthropological articles.</p>
<p>They they they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re better off and like we&rsquo;re beat Nick smoke pot and talk about it</p>
<p>over a glass of wine.</p>
<p>Let me clean up something.</p>
<p>Just so look, I have no special desire to defend London breed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are many.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are many better people.</p>
<p>Are you wearing a London breed brand sweater?</p>
<p>Is that London breed?</p>
<p>Tom Ford.</p>
<p>Tom Ford.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry.</p>
<p>Tom Ford.</p>
<p>Tom Ford.</p>
<p>Tom Ford.</p>
<p>Tom Ford.</p>
<p>Look, I&rsquo;m sure there are better mayors.</p>
<p>But just I think I think we have to sort of temper what you said based on the realities</p>
<p>of politics in San Francisco, which are which are this.</p>
<p>We actually have a weak mayor.</p>
<p>The mayor can&rsquo;t do anything without the vote of the board of supervisors.</p>
<p>And the suits are controlled right now by a bunch of crazies who are basically allies,</p>
<p>Dean Preston and Matt Haney, Hillary Rodin, who are who are allies of Chesa Boudin.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So London breed, I think, wants to do some good things.</p>
<p>I think that she is more pragmatic than these ideologues.</p>
<p>I think that she could have been more aggressive and more outspoken about standing up to them.</p>
<p>However, earlier.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But I think she is now doing the right thing in terms of the speech she just gave,</p>
<p>basically calling for refunding the police.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re sick of the bullshit and we&rsquo;re going to take action.</p>
<p>Those are the right things to be saying right now.</p>
<p>She did the right thing in terms of supporting the recall of the school board.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m saying is, let&rsquo;s give her a chance to see if she does come out</p>
<p>of the recall of Chesa Boudin, because I think that&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s headed.</p>
<p>And if she gets on board with that, and she shows she&rsquo;s pragmatic,</p>
<p>she may actually survive.</p>
<p>You said fundraiser.</p>
<p>If she gets out, it&rsquo;s happening all around the country, right?</p>
<p>We saw Bill de Blasio, who was the first real progressive leftist elected to a major city</p>
<p>company, completely ran New York City into the ground.</p>
<p>Now, Eric Adams is going to go clean it up, right?</p>
<p>We had Glenn Young, who basically ran a centrist campaign, take over Virginia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s over, Johnny.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>Centrism, pragmatism, enough of these extreme polar opposites.</p>
<p>Okay, right.</p>
<p>Let let Antifa and the Proud Boys go and make love to each other in some deserted island.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>I heard somebody said to me, like Proud Boys.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the other group?</p>
<p>Oath Keepers or something?</p>
<p>This woman who&rsquo;s gay.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, Oh, you know, it was Rachel Maddow.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, I think these are like gay activist groups, aren&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>Like Proud Boys?</p>
<p>It sounds like a gay activist group.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re seeing the the correction of the overreaction, the pandemic cause what</p>
<p>Neil Ferguson calls pandemic politics that we that the pandemic bred a strain of radical</p>
<p>politics that we saw all over the country.</p>
<p>And I think on both sides, and I think the country is going to come out of that.</p>
<p>Did you see these idiots go to Cheesecake Factory and do a sit in without their masks</p>
<p>on?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s their form of protest is like, we&rsquo;re going to go into the Cheesecake Factory.</p>
<p>Who are you talking about?</p>
<p>It was a Cheesecake Factory protest.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s going national with people who are anti mask, anti vax.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re don&rsquo;t want to have to show their cards or wear a mask when they walk to their</p>
<p>seat.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re literally doing sit ins at Cheesecake Factory.</p>
<p>I would protest going to a Cheesecake Factory.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to protest in a Cheesecake Factory.</p>
<p>Well, some people aren&rsquo;t on a diet like you, Jake, and they enjoy cheesecake.</p>
<p>Ah, well, where are you at?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the number?</p>
<p>Just give us the number.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your weight?</p>
<p>Around 170.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 174.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m coming right up behind you.</p>
<p>You hear the steps.</p>
<p>Sexy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to tell you, bro.</p>
<p>I love your sweater.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to drive to the city, come to the mausoleum and make love to you with that</p>
<p>sweater on.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>All right, everybody.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see you next week on the podcast.</p>
<p>Love you, besties.</p>
<p>Love you, Saks.</p>
<p>Love you, Saks.</p>
<p>Back at you.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
