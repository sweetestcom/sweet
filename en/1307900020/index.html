    <p>It&rsquo;s Hardcore History.</p>
<p>Attention.</p>
<p>So, like most of you, I have my historical pet peeves.</p>
<p>And one of them is when sort of the lightweight media program here or there, I&rsquo;ll be listening</p>
<p>and they will confuse the Roman Empire and the Roman Republic.</p>
<p>They mean the Roman Republic, but they say the Roman Empire, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the fall of the Roman Empire or whatever.</p>
<p>So, you know, that gets under my skin in a way that is totally out of proportion to the</p>
<p>seriousness of the crime, but, you know, like I said, we all have our little things.</p>
<p>But as many of you know, and we did an exhaustive long series on this, there was a Republican</p>
<p>period and then an empire.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s so fascinating in the history books is that hinge point during the transition</p>
<p>when it becomes an empire out of a republic.</p>
<p>And this is traditional, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s Caesar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Shakespeare.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, everybody understands this is a very interesting spot here.</p>
<p>And our entire long series, Death Rose of the Republic, was supposed to be a not very</p>
<p>long show about this fabulously interesting person from the ancient world, Cleopatra.</p>
<p>And as is, you know, I have problems, but one of those problems is the need to try to</p>
<p>go back earlier in the story to set up, you know, the way things are by the time you get</p>
<p>to the story.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t ever find a logical beginning point because every time I get to something</p>
<p>earlier that has a history of its own, right?</p>
<p>That explains how that.</p>
<p>So, you know, we ended up covering centuries, I believe, and barely got to Cleopatra, ended</p>
<p>the story kind of at the hinge point area that is so fascinating.</p>
<p>The author I want to talk to today, the historian Barry Strauss, he&rsquo;s a Cornell University professor.</p>
<p>He is an expert on this period.</p>
<p>And he just finished a book, and it&rsquo;s a very military history book for people who like</p>
<p>naval warfare from this period, which is, if you ever want to have your mind blown about</p>
<p>what our ancestors were able to do in terms of achievements and, well, I mean, in these</p>
<p>naval battles, there&rsquo;s like 600 ships, right?</p>
<p>Wooden ships, big ships, and the mind has a hard time grasping that, right?</p>
<p>But this is, so the book is fascinating.</p>
<p>You want to know about naval warfare, you want to know about one of the most famous</p>
<p>naval encounters in all human history.</p>
<p>Well, he&rsquo;s just finished a book on the Battle of Actium, 31 BCE, right?</p>
<p>And the people who fought it out after Julius Caesar is assassinated have their climactic</p>
<p>encounter and the reason that the Cleopatra story plays into this is she&rsquo;s on one side</p>
<p>of this affair, right, with Mark Antony.</p>
<p>This is just like Shakespeare, right?</p>
<p>These are these famous figures we&rsquo;ve come to know.</p>
<p>And on the other side is Octavian, the guy who will become Augustus Caesar, really the</p>
<p>transition figure from the Republican era to the empire.</p>
<p>And this battle sort of determines how that hinge point is going to go.</p>
<p>Obviously, if Octavian wins, which he did, it goes the way it went.</p>
<p>If the other side wins, Mark Antony and Cleopatra together, united, if that wins, nobody knows</p>
<p>how it goes.</p>
<p>Right, maybe you go back to a republic, which I guess seems pretty doubtful after my talk</p>
<p>with Professor Strauss, or maybe the empire goes in a different direction with a focus</p>
<p>more in the East, as Professor Strauss is going to say in the interview we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to conduct right now.</p>
<p>Barry Strauss with his brand new book, The War That Made the Roman Empire, Antony, Cleopatra</p>
<p>and Octavian at Actium.</p>
<p>With me, Professor Barry Strauss to talk about his brand new book on the Battle of</p>
<p>Actium, The War That Made the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>And I just want to tell you, Professor Strauss, that I tried to do a show on Cleopatra once</p>
<p>upon a time, and I started trying to figure out where a program like that should start.</p>
<p>And I kept moving the timeline farther and farther back, because first you go to Julius</p>
<p>Caesar, and then how do you explain Julius Caesar without explaining, you know, this</p>
<p>and that?</p>
<p>And then, I mean, it eventually goes all the way back to the end of the Punic Wars and</p>
<p>barely even touches upon Cleopatra when we get to 20 some hours.</p>
<p>So how does one tell a story like this without going back almost to when the Republic starts</p>
<p>to fray?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, it&rsquo;s a tough question.</p>
<p>I had some trouble myself when I first started writing the book.</p>
<p>I wanted to start it in the spring of 32 B.C. with the gathering of the Roman fleet or Antony</p>
<p>and Cleopatra&rsquo;s fleet at Ephesus.</p>
<p>And my editor wisely said, no, you&rsquo;ve got to start the story with the assassination</p>
<p>of Julius Caesar.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where it has to begin, because you can&rsquo;t really explain what it&rsquo;s all about without</p>
<p>doing that.</p>
<p>And I realized his wisdom and that he was right.</p>
<p>So that is where I start the story.</p>
<p>But as you know, Cleopatra has a whole life and career well before that, and even before</p>
<p>she meets Caesar.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something artificial no matter where you start it.</p>
<p>Well, in her dynasty, you know, the Ptolemaic dynasty is itself, as you point out, three</p>
<p>centuries of history dating back to, you know, the ultimate royalty in ancient Western heritage,</p>
<p>the Alexandrian folk.</p>
<p>Talk about.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s set this up maybe by talking about Cleopatra herself a little bit, because she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an unusual person in the ancient world.</p>
<p>You know, as we all know, powerful women did not get the sort of historical press that</p>
<p>they deserve.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s precious few of them.</p>
<p>And when they are in the sources, you kind of get this bias like you get with Alexander&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother, where she&rsquo;s somewhat nefarious and tricky and, you know, conniving.</p>
<p>Talk a little bit about this background that the Ptolemaic dynasty is and that that imparts</p>
<p>into Cleopatra&rsquo;s sense of who she is and what she represents.</p>
<p>Well, great question.</p>
<p>Cleopatra as a Ptolemy has a built-in sense of grandeur.</p>
<p>The founder of the dynasty was one of Alexander&rsquo;s friends and one of his generals.</p>
<p>And he is the guy who takes over Egypt and turns it into a kingdom.</p>
<p>And he hijacks Alexander&rsquo;s funeral train and brings his mummified corpse to Alexandria.</p>
<p>You know, tradition says that Alexander is the one who founded and laid out the city</p>
<p>of Alexandria.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s reason to doubt that and reason to suspect that it&rsquo;s actually Ptolemy who</p>
<p>does that.</p>
<p>But he takes the aura of the great Alexander.</p>
<p>He wants to borrow it to say that this is Alexander&rsquo;s city and he&rsquo;s following the footsteps</p>
<p>of the founder.</p>
<p>And in either case, he creates what becomes in its day, and for many, many centuries,</p>
<p>the greatest city in the Mediterranean world.</p>
<p>It is the great cultural center.</p>
<p>And I think we underestimate even today the importance and influence of Alexandria.</p>
<p>For a Roman who visited it in Caesar&rsquo;s day, I think it would have been overwhelming in</p>
<p>some way.</p>
<p>It really is like going from the farm and seeing Paris.</p>
<p>Rome was the great military and naval power, but it was not an impressive urban center.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t have the monuments yet.</p>
<p>Alexandria had the monuments and Alexandria had the culture and the science.</p>
<p>It really was a glittering capital.</p>
<p>And Cleopatra was raised in the glory of this dynasty.</p>
<p>They had ruled an empire in the Eastern Mediterranean for centuries, and it had its ups and downs.</p>
<p>But at its height, it had been a great naval power and a great land power, stretching to</p>
<p>Greece, to Asia Minor, as far west as Syracuse, which was an ally of the Ptolemies, and certainly</p>
<p>around the Levant in Egypt and Libya, and down to the Red Sea, where the Egyptians had</p>
<p>trade with India.</p>
<p>So it was a great center with a tremendous heritage.</p>
<p>The hijacking of Alexander the Great&rsquo;s body is one of my favorite stories, and maybe the</p>
<p>best example of that phrase, that possession is nine-tenths of the law, right?</p>
<p>And I love the visits to Alexander&rsquo;s mummified corpse.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s one in your story, and then there&rsquo;s, was it Caligula or Nero that also went and</p>
<p>maybe supposedly stole the armor later?</p>
<p>I love that story, but I also love the fact that you can tell that this is a conquest</p>
<p>dynasty, the Ptolemies, because they&rsquo;re there for three centuries or something, and their</p>
<p>last ruler, Cleopatra, is the only one to speak Egyptian in the whole group.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know, it really is.</p>
<p>It is kind of amazing.</p>
<p>Some people think it&rsquo;s more evidence for what might be possible, that her mother and maybe</p>
<p>her grandmother were Egyptian, or at least partly Egyptian.</p>
<p>You said Persian, maybe, too.</p>
<p>Yes, there is definitely some Persian in there, because the Ptolemies intermarried.</p>
<p>But yeah, I mean, they really kept themselves apart from the Egyptians.</p>
<p>They used Egyptians increasingly as the dynasty, in the later years of the dynasty, they used</p>
<p>Egyptians.</p>
<p>And they kept themselves quite aloof from Egyptians.</p>
<p>And some ancient texts refer to Alexandria as Alexandria at Egypt, Alexandria by Egypt,</p>
<p>we might say, rather than Alexandria in Egypt.</p>
<p>It saw itself as separate from Egypt.</p>
<p>And yeah, they are conquerors, and Cleopatra is, as far as we know, the only one who could</p>
<p>speak Egyptian.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s money, right?</p>
<p>I mean, the Ptolemies and Egypt represent, in this period, when one talks about the balance</p>
<p>sheet and what each side has as its strong point, the Ptolemies and Egypt have money,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>They have money, yes.</p>
<p>This is the wealthiest place in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>They are sitting on a lot of money.</p>
<p>And the Romans know it.</p>
<p>The Romans could have conquered Egypt before this, but probably the reason they don&rsquo;t is</p>
<p>that the various men in the Roman elite are all too jealous of each other and too suspicious</p>
<p>of each other.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want anyone to have control of this place.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about those people then.</p>
<p>So this is where, if you are trying to argue against the great man theory of history, right,</p>
<p>the ancient or even Churchillian way of looking at these things, it&rsquo;s so hard when you get</p>
<p>to this era because the individual personalities seem to be defying any rules about trends</p>
<p>and forces or Marxist economic theory.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, you say Octavian, Julius Caesar, Cleopatra, Antony.</p>
<p>How do you get?</p>
<p>How does one integrate that with the fact that there are obviously massive trends and</p>
<p>forces being exerted during this time period?</p>
<p>And yet these individuals, even in modern histories that are trained to maybe not put</p>
<p>individuals out there so front and center, it&rsquo;s hard to avoid in this case, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s one of the reasons I find the period so attractive because I&rsquo;m an old fashioned</p>
<p>historian.</p>
<p>I mean, of course, I think trends are important.</p>
<p>And one of the overriding trends of this era was figuring out how to bring the elites and</p>
<p>the conquered of the Roman Empire into the tent of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the old Roman nobility had so much trouble doing.</p>
<p>That being said, there&rsquo;s all the difference in the world between someone like Antony,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s very talented, and someone like Octavian, who&rsquo;s just a supernova when it comes to what</p>
<p>it takes to be a strategist and to to win a war.</p>
<p>Personality really does make a difference.</p>
<p>OK, well, let&rsquo;s talk about that then, because one often wonders how some of these people</p>
<p>come to the fore.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And often one thinks of self-made people or pseudo self-made people.</p>
<p>And maybe a guy like Julius Caesar falls into that category.</p>
<p>But his adopted son, Octavian, or his adopted nephew, I mean, his successor here, who is</p>
<p>handpicked, is not a person that had to go through that period of the self-made pull</p>
<p>yourself up from the bottom, although Caesar wasn&rsquo;t from the bottom either.</p>
<p>But you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>In other words, somebody looked at this kid and kid he was at the time, and maybe it was</p>
<p>Julius himself and said, you&rsquo;re destined for great things.</p>
<p>You have these specific qualities.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to make you my heir.</p>
<p>So it seems like this is this is almost like, in my weird way of thinking, Julius Caesar&rsquo;s</p>
<p>last will and testament that allows his kind of his disruptive force.</p>
<p>Maybe he would have thought about it as as something more positive than that, but but</p>
<p>allowing it to live on.</p>
<p>How does this Octavian guy make his way to the historical stage?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>I think there are three people in particular who who are important.</p>
<p>First of all, there&rsquo;s his mother.</p>
<p>The Romans really thought the mother-son relationship was tremendously important.</p>
<p>When Octavian&rsquo;s four years old, his father dies, probably of a stroke or a heart attack.</p>
<p>And so he and his older sisters no longer have a father.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s his mother, Atia, she remarries.</p>
<p>She marries a prominent Roman politician named, golly, I&rsquo;m blanking on his name, excuse me.</p>
<p>But she marries a prominent Roman politician.</p>
<p>And she looks after her son, her young son.</p>
<p>She hands him over at a certain point to her mother, Julia.</p>
<p>And Julia is a pure Roman member of the nobility.</p>
<p>And she happens to be the sister of Julius Caesar.</p>
<p>And we can be sure that Julia is whispering in her brother&rsquo;s ear, I got this grandson.</p>
<p>You got to see this kid.</p>
<p>He is so talented.</p>
<p>And Caesar, when he comes to Rome, which isn&rsquo;t all that often, but from time to time, he</p>
<p>does see young Gaius Octavius.</p>
<p>And he does get a sense of just how talented, how precocious he is.</p>
<p>And Caesar gives him certain offices.</p>
<p>He holds minor offices, even as a teenager.</p>
<p>And he plays a role in Caesar&rsquo;s triumphs as well.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of these people who Caesar is clearly marking out for an important role.</p>
<p>Caesar doesn&rsquo;t have a legitimate son of his own.</p>
<p>And his daughter, who he was hoping would bring him grandchildren, she dies in childbirth.</p>
<p>So he doesn&rsquo;t have that either.</p>
<p>So he looks to members of his extended family.</p>
<p>Then in the last battle of the Roman Civil War, so the campaign in Spain in 45 BC in</p>
<p>the Battle of Munda, Octavius goes to Spain.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t arrive in time for the battle, but he arrives shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>And he spends about six months traveling around Spain with his great uncle, Julius Caesar,</p>
<p>the two of them together.</p>
<p>Octavius is sitting at the foot of the master and learning from him.</p>
<p>And Caesar is getting really impressed with this kid and realizing, you know, the guy</p>
<p>really has, the guy really has something.</p>
<p>So I think that helps Octavius a lot to be recognized.</p>
<p>Now we all know that trying to draw lessons or conclusions about modern times from times</p>
<p>in the past is a silly endeavor.</p>
<p>Yet there are things, there&rsquo;s precious few examples from the ancient world of when you</p>
<p>look at governments like republics and try to figure out what the heck went wrong in</p>
<p>that situation, then try to figure out if you have any of the same potential downsides</p>
<p>in your own situation.</p>
<p>If you look at something like the Roman Republic and as the founders of the United States used</p>
<p>as one of the examples of things we might take lessons from, what was going wrong by</p>
<p>Caesar&rsquo;s time, Julius Caesar&rsquo;s time that led to the conditions where you have, I mean,</p>
<p>as I look at it, I almost see everybody seems to be fighting on the side of Rome and the</p>
<p>Senate and the Republic traditions and all that side, but nobody actually really seems</p>
<p>to be fighting on the side of Rome and the Senate and the Republic.</p>
<p>I mean, this is a culture that so hated the idea of the return of the ancient kings that</p>
<p>that became almost a terrible word.</p>
<p>But when you look at it in this time period, maybe Julius Caesar, certainly Octavian, certainly</p>
<p>Mark Antony, you&rsquo;re seeing a bunch of people who, as you point out, are looking in one</p>
<p>shape or another to create a monarchy out of the Republic, the most hated thing that</p>
<p>the Republic ever, I mean, there&rsquo;s almost a visceral knee-jerk reaction to the idea</p>
<p>of a king coming to the fore.</p>
<p>And yet somehow the Senate rolls over and by the end of Octavian&rsquo;s reign, we&rsquo;ve come</p>
<p>to a time where the Roman Republic, at least in terms of the way it really functions, as</p>
<p>opposed to the way it maybe presents itself, you know, to the rest of the world or to its</p>
<p>own people, I mean, is gone.</p>
<p>And as you correctly point out, we transition from an era that really represents the ancient</p>
<p>world into something that is starting almost the timeline of the modern world from the</p>
<p>very beginning.</p>
<p>What happens to an anti-monarchal society like Rome that gets it to a place where they</p>
<p>have their own version of the equivalent of a king?</p>
<p>Great question.</p>
<p>A long question.</p>
<p>I apologize for that.</p>
<p>No, not at all.</p>
<p>Revolution happens.</p>
<p>A century of revolution, a century of violence and upheaval and war and, you know, tearing</p>
<p>each other to pieces to get to the point where the Romans say, anything is better than this.</p>
<p>Anything is better than this.</p>
<p>And they get, luckily for them, they get a politician who&rsquo;s incredibly shrewd and knows</p>
<p>how to package things.</p>
<p>I mean, Caesar offends people by his arrogance, by the way he-</p>
<p>You mean Julius, right?</p>
<p>Julius.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Julius Caesar.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Julius Caesar offends people by his arrogance and he makes people beg his pardon.</p>
<p>Even though he grants his pardon, it hurts them, these nobles, to have to ask another</p>
<p>Roman noble for pardon.</p>
<p>Then he takes the term of dictator perpetuo, dictator in perpetuity, just as to the Romans,</p>
<p>them&rsquo;s fighting words.</p>
<p>He also experiments with wearing the boots, the red boots of a king.</p>
<p>And he sits on a, I think it is a gold and ivory folding chair, which is reminiscent</p>
<p>of a king.</p>
<p>And he ostentatiously turns down a crown when it&rsquo;s offered to him by his lieutenant, Mark</p>
<p>Antony, who&rsquo;s pretty close to him, so people suspect it&rsquo;s a put-up job.</p>
<p>Octavian is much smarter than that.</p>
<p>He says, actually, the term dictator had been abolished by Antony of all people after Caesar&rsquo;s</p>
<p>death.</p>
<p>Octavian says, I&rsquo;m no dictator, I&rsquo;m no king, I&rsquo;m just the first citizen.</p>
<p>And I govern by having the power of tribunes and I have the power of a consul.</p>
<p>But the republic has been restored, or the Latin can also mean the republic has been</p>
<p>renovated, so it&rsquo;s nicely ambiguous.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just going to take an honorary title.</p>
<p>I want you to call me the reverend, which is more or less, yeah, that&rsquo;s what Augustus</p>
<p>means more or less, the reverend, the revered one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a quasi-religious title.</p>
<p>The Romans said that their city had been founded by an august augury, Augusto Augurio.</p>
<p>So it seems traditionalist, sort of.</p>
<p>And it allows some people to say, well, nothing much has really changed.</p>
<p>And yet everything has changed.</p>
<p>So then you get the obvious knee-jerk response of a group of people that are concerned about</p>
<p>their own position in society, right?</p>
<p>All these senators, all these Roman knights, these Roman nobles.</p>
<p>And the natural reaction is an assassination.</p>
<p>So the Ides of March happen, 44 BC, you see the assassination of Julius Caesar.</p>
<p>And then all hell breaks loose in a different way than the earlier hell that had broken</p>
<p>loose.</p>
<p>So describe a little bit, because this is the setup to this major battle that your book</p>
<p>focuses on.</p>
<p>So explain the second version of all hell breaking loose after Julius Caesar is killed.</p>
<p>So the second version of all hell breaking loose is the assassins think that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be able to get away with it and in some sense restore the republic, by which</p>
<p>they meant an oligarchy of what they saw as the few best and most patriotic and intelligent</p>
<p>men in Rome.</p>
<p>But they fail, I think, in large part because they don&rsquo;t understand that you need to pay</p>
<p>the soldiers and give them a raise if you expect to get away with something like this.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re forced out of Rome and then they regroup.</p>
<p>And Antony, who is one of the two consuls, one of the two leading magistrates in Rome</p>
<p>at the time, thinks he&rsquo;s going to inherit the mantle of Julius Caesar.</p>
<p>But the problem is that Caesar has left this will in which to many people&rsquo;s surprise, he</p>
<p>names his 18-year-old great nephew Octavius as his heir and he offers him posthumous adoption.</p>
<p>By the way, there&rsquo;s no such thing as posthumous adoption in Rome.</p>
<p>It exists because Julius Caesar says, because I say so.</p>
<p>And then Octavian, who happened to be abroad at the time because Caesar was planning a</p>
<p>great new military expedition against Parthia, the Persian Empire, Octavian was a part of</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>He works his way back to Italy and works his way back to Rome.</p>
<p>And he shows that Caesar&rsquo;s faith in him was very well placed because he gets himself introduced</p>
<p>to Caesar&rsquo;s faction, to the leading men in it, and persuades them that he is an alternative</p>
<p>to Antony.</p>
<p>And then he has his agents negotiate with Antony&rsquo;s troops.</p>
<p>Once again, Antony makes the mistake of stiffing the soldiers, of not offering them enough</p>
<p>money.</p>
<p>Octavian offers them a big raise.</p>
<p>And he, in effect, he steals some of Antony&rsquo;s legions from him and creates a private army</p>
<p>and then turns around and says, you know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on the side of the assassins.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on the side of the Republic.</p>
<p>And I want to help you fight Antony and drive Antony out of Italy, which he proceeds to</p>
<p>do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long and juicy story, and I won&rsquo;t bore you with all the details, but he drives Antony</p>
<p>out of Italy.</p>
<p>Antony crosses the Alps, goes to Gaul, regroups, makes new allies, builds a new army of his</p>
<p>own.</p>
<p>And then Octavian says, on second thought, I&rsquo;m friends with Antony.</p>
<p>He turns around and double crosses the Senate.</p>
<p>And Antony and Octavius and a third general of Caesar&rsquo;s, Marcus Lepidus, they form a conspiracy</p>
<p>outside of the city of Bologna in November of 43 BC.</p>
<p>And they create what&rsquo;s called the Second Triumvirate.</p>
<p>The three of them are going to govern Rome.</p>
<p>They march on Rome.</p>
<p>And this time, no more Mr. Nice Guy.</p>
<p>Caesar pardoned most of his enemies in the First Civil War.</p>
<p>They do not pardon them.</p>
<p>They put their names up in prescriptions like Sulla.</p>
<p>Many of them flee.</p>
<p>These are public execution lists, right?</p>
<p>Yes, these are public execution lists, public execution lists.</p>
<p>So many of the names on the list flee.</p>
<p>Their property gets confiscated because Antony and Octavian and Lepidus need money.</p>
<p>They need money because the surviving assassins, led by Brutus and Cassius, are in the east.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re in the process of squeezing the east until the pipsqueak, raising taxes everywhere,</p>
<p>because they figured out you have to pay the soldiers and create a great army if you want</p>
<p>to save the republic.</p>
<p>So the most famous victim of these prescriptions is Cicero, who does not escape.</p>
<p>And Cicero is assassinated, executed, killed on the order of his great enemy, Marc Antony.</p>
<p>And Octavian later says, well, I tried to stop it.</p>
<p>But if he did, he didn&rsquo;t try.</p>
<p>Supposedly had a needle put through his tongue.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>A needle put through his tongue and his hands were cut off and tied up, posted to the roster</p>
<p>in Rome.</p>
<p>Speaker&rsquo;s platform.</p>
<p>So let me interrupt you for a second so that people understand how weird this all is, though.</p>
<p>Imagine the U.S. Civil War and imagine that the North and South generals controlled the</p>
<p>armies instead of the state.</p>
<p>And imagine that they could get defections from the other side.</p>
<p>So if General Lee was able to get some of Ulysses S. Grant&rsquo;s units to come over to his</p>
<p>side if he just promised them a better deal or something, I mean, that&rsquo;s part of it.</p>
<p>And then this goes back.</p>
<p>And this is why I had such a hard time figuring out where to start that story on Cleopatra.</p>
<p>But at some point, you know, Rome goes from the state and the Senate controlling the armies</p>
<p>and their loyalty to individual generals doing so, you know, from the from the Marius reforms</p>
<p>and all that.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;re in a period where, you know, these these troops are beholden to Mark Antony</p>
<p>or to Octavian and not necessarily to the state.</p>
<p>And if somebody offers them a better deal or doesn&rsquo;t pay them or follow through on the</p>
<p>deal they thought they had, you&rsquo;re in danger of having mass defections.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like having an army that you can&rsquo;t trust yourself as a commander.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s absolutely right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s absolutely right.</p>
<p>The whole nature of the Roman military changes and it changes because of just the enormous</p>
<p>dislocations and changes that Rome underwent in the process of winning an empire, conquering</p>
<p>an empire, using the manpower of Italy to conquer the empire.</p>
<p>Enormous new wealth poured into Italy and it wasn&rsquo;t distributed equitably.</p>
<p>It ended up in a few hands and they used this power unfairly to hurt some of the ordinary</p>
<p>people of of Rome.</p>
<p>You know, I think like many societies, the Republic was faced with the challenge of what</p>
<p>to do about change because things do change.</p>
<p>And in the case of Rome, they changed in an enormous, dramatic, explosive way.</p>
<p>And the Romans didn&rsquo;t really know what to do with it.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t handle it very well.</p>
<p>Oh, one is one is tempted to ask who would, you know, when you when you look at, you</p>
<p>know, a society and a governmental system designed for a small, you know, city, state</p>
<p>or regional power that has to deal with after the third Punic War, this this massive</p>
<p>world juggernaut and all the money coming in and all the the accruing of individual.</p>
<p>I mean, I think of Marcus Licinius Crassus and the amount of money he&rsquo;s bringing.</p>
<p>I mean, that kind of money warps systems.</p>
<p>And then when you have the private army and the armies can be built up through that</p>
<p>money, it just seems like a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s talk about how the heck a descendant of one of Alexander&rsquo;s generals, 300</p>
<p>years later, a queen running Egypt ends up into this story.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you know, the Ptolemies were already part of this story.</p>
<p>The Romans had essentially made it clear that they were going to call the ultimate</p>
<p>shots shots in Egypt already in the middle of the second century B.C.</p>
<p>By the time of Cleopatra, her father, Ptolemy, a late Ptolemy, the flute player, as he</p>
<p>was called, for reasons that that&rsquo;s when, you know, the empire is in decline.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to say, yeah, that&rsquo;s when, you know, it&rsquo;s in decline.</p>
<p>Not not kind of the name you want to have.</p>
<p>Nobody called Alexander the Great the flute player to his face, not to his face.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, this guy, you know, to save his kingdom, he had to borrow a huge amount of</p>
<p>money from Rome. And then he had to basically mortgage his kingdom to to to pay it</p>
<p>back. So he was in hock to the Romans.</p>
<p>And Egypt was essentially belonged to Rome already.</p>
<p>It was only semi independent.</p>
<p>And Cleopatra was raised knowing that Egypt could do nothing without paying attention</p>
<p>to its relationship with Rome.</p>
<p>OK, and so she comes to the fore, she&rsquo;s got a brother that she&rsquo;s that she&rsquo;s forced to</p>
<p>rule. How would you describe the relationship?</p>
<p>The Ptolemies had a brother sister thing that went back maybe to maybe even before that</p>
<p>time, maybe ancient Egypt.</p>
<p>Explain the brother sister deal here.</p>
<p>And then how the heck does Julius Caesar get his hands in this situation?</p>
<p>Well, the Ptolemies, like like Egyptians, many people in Egypt before that engaged in</p>
<p>brother sister marriage, you know, you know, it&rsquo;s going to lead to a decline right there</p>
<p>over time, maybe that could it could.</p>
<p>But they didn&rsquo;t only engage in brother sister marriage.</p>
<p>I mean, that was one of the things they did.</p>
<p>But the siblings sibling rivalry was a big part of the story.</p>
<p>And Cleopatra and her siblings did not get along.</p>
<p>They had murderous relationships with each other.</p>
<p>She was at war with her older brother and she she possibly poisoned her younger brother</p>
<p>and probably ordered the murder of her sister.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not a pretty picture.</p>
<p>And then the famous story, true or not, I keep wondering what would have happened had</p>
<p>Shakespeare not not talked about these things, had they not become such great stories for</p>
<p>for entertainment value.</p>
<p>But the story about her being unrolled in a bedroll or a rolled up carpet for for you</p>
<p>know who. Tell me a little about that.</p>
<p>Well, in order to you know, Cleopatra had been pushed off her throne by her brother and</p>
<p>she wanted to get it back.</p>
<p>Caesar had come to Egypt hoping to catch up with Pompey, who he defeated.</p>
<p>And he had defeated in a great battle in Greece.</p>
<p>Earlier that year, but when Pompey landed in Egypt, he was assassinated on the order</p>
<p>of one of the king&rsquo;s ministers.</p>
<p>So he was dead by the time Caesar got there.</p>
<p>Caesar wanted to arrange things in Egypt to his liking because Egypt had been friendly</p>
<p>with Pompey beforehand.</p>
<p>But Caesar didn&rsquo;t have many troops with him and he was effectively a prisoner.</p>
<p>He had to fight his way out of Alexandria and he does so successfully eventually.</p>
<p>But while he&rsquo;s there, Cleopatra sussing up the situation, realizes I can make a deal</p>
<p>with this guy. We each need something and we each need to fight my brother.</p>
<p>And so she sneaks into the palace.</p>
<p>Her brother would never let her get into the palace.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s camouflaged in some way.</p>
<p>And we get the story from Plutarch that she was rolled.</p>
<p>She was carried by a servant, rolled up in a bedroll or a rug, and then unrolled in</p>
<p>front of Julius Caesar.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an entrance for you.</p>
<p>Yeah, that she knew how to make an entrance.</p>
<p>And if it wasn&rsquo;t love at first sight, it didn&rsquo;t take long between the two of them were</p>
<p>lovers. And she was young at the time, right?</p>
<p>Yes, she was young.</p>
<p>He was decades older.</p>
<p>Well, he&rsquo;s 55 or something by then, probably.</p>
<p>Yeah. And she&rsquo;s she&rsquo;s in her 20s.</p>
<p>OK, so there you go.</p>
<p>And now we have.</p>
<p>So this is interesting.</p>
<p>You have one of the examples and I think you make the case multiple times in your book.</p>
<p>You have one of the examples of a truly august, clever politician slash world leader who</p>
<p>because of the way media&rsquo;s portrayed her ever since becomes more of a femme fatale sort</p>
<p>of figure. Can we describe the difference between the romantic image of this person</p>
<p>versus the reality of one of the one of the few justifiably powerful women controlling</p>
<p>things in the Western ancient world?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I mean, part of it, frankly, is Shakespeare.</p>
<p>I mean, Shakespeare&rsquo;s play is called Antony and Cleopatra, and the focus of the play is</p>
<p>the love affair between the two of them and the relationship between the two of them and</p>
<p>the interplay of love and Paul Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton and</p>
<p>Elizabeth Taylor. Yes, the legend that was better than the movie, but certainly added</p>
<p>to the aura around Cleopatra.</p>
<p>But even without them, just the play itself and the various actresses who&rsquo;ve played</p>
<p>Cleopatra, the real Cleopatra, we don&rsquo;t really know what she looked like.</p>
<p>But as you know, the coins give her a hook nose and make her look kind of masculine,</p>
<p>not very no one&rsquo;s idea of feminine beauty.</p>
<p>The the bust that may be Cleopatra, and there&rsquo;s only one that scholars agree probably</p>
<p>really was Cleopatra.</p>
<p>They make her much better looking.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know if the coins are the real Cleopatra or the image that she wanted to</p>
<p>put out. So she was effectively ruling alone.</p>
<p>She wanted people to think she was as tough as a man and might have wanted to look,</p>
<p>excuse me, might have wanted to look like a man.</p>
<p>But I think if we want to think who Cleopatra really was, we ought to think of Catherine</p>
<p>the Great or Elizabeth the first of England.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah. Indira Gandhi, someone like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Golda Meir.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Cleopatra, in effect, or Maggie Thatcher.</p>
<p>I like that if you look at what she&rsquo;s doing here from a gambling standpoint, right,</p>
<p>taking take I mean, here you have the Ptolemaic Empire.</p>
<p>If things just go the way they&rsquo;re going in terms of the the momentum and the impetus</p>
<p>when she&rsquo;s, you know, first meeting Julius Caesar, it doesn&rsquo;t look good.</p>
<p>So she takes a roll of the dice here and tries to get the best outcome for her</p>
<p>country. And the best outcome is aligning with one side of the Roman Civil War here</p>
<p>and hoping she turns out victorious.</p>
<p>If Mark Antony wins this thing instead of Octavian, how does that change?</p>
<p>In other words, if if she rolls the dice here and wins, what does that look like?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>I mean, how different things would have been if Antony had won.</p>
<p>Then the Roman Empire would, in effect, have had two capitals, Rome and Alexandria.</p>
<p>The empire would inevitably have turned eastward instead of what we did with Augustus,</p>
<p>which is an attempt to conquer Germany that fails and then his successors who succeed</p>
<p>in conquering Britain.</p>
<p>I think Antony would have gone back to his attempt to conquer at least part of the</p>
<p>Parthian Empire, probably too much to imagine him conquering all of it.</p>
<p>I think Rome would have turned eastward.</p>
<p>You know, the Roman Empire, even as it was, was really a Greco-Roman empire with</p>
<p>increasingly as much Greek culture as there was Roman culture.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to say that the two best sellers of the Roman Empire today are the New</p>
<p>Testament and the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius, and they&rsquo;re both written in Greek,</p>
<p>not in Latin.</p>
<p>Well, if Alexandria had remained as a cultural and political capital, then the culture</p>
<p>that would have developed in the Roman Empire would have even been more eastern, more</p>
<p>Greek, more looking towards the east than what develops in Rome.</p>
<p>And that would have had a big impact on Western culture as well.</p>
<p>Would have extended the Alexandrian generals&rsquo; empires even longer, too.</p>
<p>And I mean, when you think about what&rsquo;s going to come in the 500s and the 600s, and</p>
<p>you wonder, had Alexandria been this major world locus of power at the time?</p>
<p>I mean, does that impact Islam&rsquo;s rise or the power of the Sassanids?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s going to be the Sassanids and the Byzantines for so long.</p>
<p>I mean, the change in the balance of power over the next several centuries would have</p>
<p>been fascinating.</p>
<p>It really would have.</p>
<p>It would have been absolutely fascinating.</p>
<p>I think you would have seen something more like the Byzantine Empire earlier, and it</p>
<p>might have even taken an even bigger bite of the apple than it actually does.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m totally fascinated by the power of Greek culture, you know, in general, but</p>
<p>especially in the eastern Mediterranean and the Near East.</p>
<p>And I think we would have seen even more of it than than we do.</p>
<p>OK, let&rsquo;s talk about the specific battle that your book discusses, because naval</p>
<p>battles in the ancient world don&rsquo;t, naval battles particularly anywhere, but in the</p>
<p>ancient world don&rsquo;t often get their due.</p>
<p>And this is more of a of a land sea combined operation here where the sea power</p>
<p>ended up being the outmaneuvering force.</p>
<p>But because I&rsquo;m fascinated and always have been with the fact that the ancients are</p>
<p>able to pull off the things they&rsquo;re able to pull off without computers, you know,</p>
<p>without without I mean, all of the stuff we would require today, Xerxes trying to put</p>
<p>together a massive invasion of Greece, you know, without without word documents, I</p>
<p>mean, whatever, whatever it might be.</p>
<p>So so I&rsquo;m thinking about the naval capacity here, and it boggles the mind when you try</p>
<p>to think of the creation of these 400 and 500 ship fleets, including these massive,</p>
<p>massive, you know, you call them the you know, they&rsquo;re not the triremes, they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>the quincri, they&rsquo;re the ten row.</p>
<p>Right. What&rsquo;s the word for that?</p>
<p>So describe the because to me, nothing says that our ancients were so clever and so</p>
<p>amazing than the raising and operating of these massive fleets.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it is amazing that they they build these ships, that they have the</p>
<p>technology to build them and then the technology to row with them and to fight</p>
<p>battles with navigate to now that navigation is really fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been great work done on the question of how did the ancients navigate?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a whole art of navigation for pre-modern societies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mostly not written down, but get lots of hints of it from ancient sources.</p>
<p>And you can learn a lot talking to fishermen in the Mediterranean even today.</p>
<p>But they they could do a lot.</p>
<p>They really could do a lot.</p>
<p>Well, and you point out the difference between the way we would do things now,</p>
<p>which you might plot a course over the waves as the crow flies, whereas back then</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t generally if you especially if you had any options, the way it was done</p>
<p>was that they sort of did a point to point thing with land bases.</p>
<p>And the part that blows my mind and I&rsquo;m sorry if I focus on on insignificant</p>
<p>things sometimes, but when you talk about them going to the isthmus of Corinth and</p>
<p>having to I assume it&rsquo;s carrying maybe you can describe this to me, the ships</p>
<p>across the isthmus so that they don&rsquo;t have to go around the dangerous storm</p>
<p>filled, you know, Peloponnesian area.</p>
<p>I mean, how do they even do that?</p>
<p>Is that like moving houses?</p>
<p>I mean, what do you know?</p>
<p>They have a rollway.</p>
<p>I mean, they can put them on rollers.</p>
<p>But that being said, the sad truth is the answer is slavery, slave labor.</p>
<p>I mean, the ancient world is this horrendous exploitation of human labor as slaves.</p>
<p>And a lot of what the Greeks and Romans do, at least on the purely mechanical</p>
<p>level, has to do with the exploitation of slave labor.</p>
<p>So that is really part of it.</p>
<p>I should have thought of that myself.</p>
<p>Having a slave show, it should have occurred to me.</p>
<p>Okay, so then let&rsquo;s get to then the battle itself.</p>
<p>So we have a situation where these two generals, Octavian, and Octavian&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to have generals working with him and a fantastic Admiral Agrippa that you talk</p>
<p>about quite a bit, and he&rsquo;s dealing with Mark Antony, who has plenty of military</p>
<p>experience himself.</p>
<p>Both of them have a lot of troops.</p>
<p>Both of them have big fleets.</p>
<p>But the one thing about your book that sort of, I guess, caught me by surprise.</p>
<p>And then I did some more information and found out it was something I probably</p>
<p>should have known better anyway, which is how sort of one-sided this thing became</p>
<p>as it progressed onward.</p>
<p>It seemed a lot less equal after a while than I had assumed it was.</p>
<p>It looks to me like Mark Antony was kind of outmaneuvered.</p>
<p>And by the time, you know, there&rsquo;s that old military adage that if you do the</p>
<p>strategy right, the tactics don&rsquo;t matter that much.</p>
<p>And I feel like that&rsquo;s what happened in this case.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>It makes total sense.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, I I&rsquo;m a big fan of Sun Tzu and his art of war.</p>
<p>And this strikes me almost as if Octavian had read Sun Tzu, which I know he hadn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But just setting things up strategically so that the enemy has very few options and</p>
<p>the enemy chances of winning.</p>
<p>I mean, Antony would have had to play to an inside straight and then some in order</p>
<p>to win this battle.</p>
<p>And it shouldn&rsquo;t have been the case.</p>
<p>He starts out with more ships and better ships and more money and lots of political</p>
<p>support. And yet he loses.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a tribute to to Octavian and Agrippa and their strategic acumen.</p>
<p>And of course, their operational ability as well.</p>
<p>OK, so both sides at one time, nobody&rsquo;s got the guts or the willingness or it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>politically untenable to say, yes, I&rsquo;m fighting for the monarchy.</p>
<p>And if I win, you know, you&rsquo;re going to have a king.</p>
<p>So both sides, neither side actually can can say that if Mark Antony wins this thing,</p>
<p>do we still have a Roman empire?</p>
<p>I mean, or are any of these people actually thinking about reestablishing anything like</p>
<p>a functioning republic?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I mean, I think Antony is a full blooded Roman noble.</p>
<p>Octavian isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a noble on his mother&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>The other members of his family come from wealthy but upper middle class types, not</p>
<p>from the Roman nobility.</p>
<p>It may be because of that, that he is much he doesn&rsquo;t much care about the old Roman way</p>
<p>of government. He has much less respect for it than Antony does.</p>
<p>Much more willing to come up with something new.</p>
<p>If Antony had won, I think he would have given the Senate more.</p>
<p>He would have given them more respect.</p>
<p>He would have deferred to them more.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know if Antony would have lived in Italy because Antony cares about the East.</p>
<p>I think he would have gone back to the East.</p>
<p>So perhaps in a way there would have been more of a republic in Italy.</p>
<p>But I think a lot of the power in the brains would have drained eastward.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated by the people who are born in history with almost no chance of reaching</p>
<p>adulthood because they&rsquo;re so dangerous.</p>
<p>So you think of like Alexander the Great&rsquo;s potential children.</p>
<p>Right. These are people whose chance.</p>
<p>I mean, they remind me of like the the little turtles that are born on the sand and then</p>
<p>have to make it to the ocean with all the predators in between them.</p>
<p>In this case, Julius Caesar, who slept with everybody and you would think would have</p>
<p>children all over the place, seemingly doesn&rsquo;t until allegedly there&rsquo;s a child with</p>
<p>Cleopatra, you know, right before he dies, Caesarean.</p>
<p>And this kid looks to me like one of those turtles with this giant stretch of sand</p>
<p>between them and the ocean, like he&rsquo;s born to die and he&rsquo;s never going to make it.</p>
<p>Did Caesarean ever have a chance or was this kid never going to make?</p>
<p>I mean, if Mark Antony wins, does this kid somehow still die?</p>
<p>No. If Mark Antony wins, I think Caesarean becomes the he becomes the pharaoh of</p>
<p>Egypt. I think in some ways he&rsquo;s Antony&rsquo;s ticket to legitimacy because the name of</p>
<p>Caesar is still magical to to many people around the Roman world.</p>
<p>And one of the reasons why Octavian is so threatened by Antony and Cleopatra is that</p>
<p>he knows that they have the real Caesar.</p>
<p>I really do think Caesarean was Caesar&rsquo;s Caesar&rsquo;s son, though I can&rsquo;t prove it.</p>
<p>You said he walked like him, you know, those kinds of that had his sort of gait.</p>
<p>He had his gait and, you know, I think if there was any and Caesar, remember, Caesar</p>
<p>allows Cleopatra to name the kid Caesar.</p>
<p>Yes, he doesn&rsquo;t recognize him officially, but the guys in Egypt and Caesars in Rome,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some reason to think it&rsquo;s not crazy that Caesar allows a stat.</p>
<p>We know that Caesar puts up a statue of Cleopatra outside of his forum in the forum of</p>
<p>Caesar outside the temple of Venus, the founder of the Julian dynasty.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some reason to think that she&rsquo;s holding the kid in her arms, holding</p>
<p>Caesarean in her arms.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a painting from Pompeii that has plausibly been described as Cleopatra</p>
<p>holding Caesarean as in the statue.</p>
<p>He comes awfully close to saying this is my son.</p>
<p>And. Allies of of Octavian go to great lengths to say, no, no, no way, no, no way.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t be true. You know, I think they did protest too much.</p>
<p>I think it was Caesar&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>And I think that that Octavian is very threatened by this, that that suddenly his</p>
<p>claim, you know, he doesn&rsquo;t call himself Octavian.</p>
<p>We call him Octavian, but he called himself Caesar.</p>
<p>He said, I&rsquo;m Caesar, as as ludicrous as that might have seemed to some.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not fair. It&rsquo;s not ludicrous, but questionable as it might have seemed to some.</p>
<p>And there there are here are these people in Egypt saying, no, no, we&rsquo;ve got the real</p>
<p>Caesar. You&rsquo;re just an imposter.</p>
<p>This is tremendously dangerous to Octavian.</p>
<p>OK, pulling on a little Sherlock Holmes here and ask for some speculation on your part.</p>
<p>But Caesar, Julius Caesar, is a guy that knows the game better than anyone.</p>
<p>Right. The backstabbing interior Roman political.</p>
<p>So so so he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s he has no illusions at all.</p>
<p>Yet this is a guy who in his supposed last will and testament makes Octavian his heir,</p>
<p>knowing full well that he probably has a child, though, in Egypt with with Cleopatra,</p>
<p>also understanding full well that this will set up a situation where either his heir is</p>
<p>probably going to die or his kid is probably going to die, probably at the hands of one</p>
<p>and other. How does this even make sense when you&rsquo;re looking at this?</p>
<p>I mean, it argues, I would suggest, for something being wrong, maybe for like the</p>
<p>original will that Octavian cites not being right.</p>
<p>Or I mean, something seems amiss here in the Sherlock, the dog that didn&rsquo;t bark type</p>
<p>situation. What do you make of this?</p>
<p>What a great question.</p>
<p>Thank you for that great question.</p>
<p>So I would say possibly Caesar just made a mistake or possibly Caesar did the best that</p>
<p>he could under the situation.</p>
<p>And, you know, he thought if Octavian is as talented as I think he is, he&rsquo;ll figure it</p>
<p>out. But, yeah, he did figure it out.</p>
<p>He did figure it out.</p>
<p>But it does raise the question, well, how is his how is his birth son going to survive?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s prescribing his son in advance.</p>
<p>Kind of. But what&rsquo;s he going to do?</p>
<p>What should he say?</p>
<p>He wants look, he does care about Rome and he cares about his family.</p>
<p>He wants Romans to not like to adopt people outside of their family.</p>
<p>Romans were cool about adoption, but it generally had to be within the family.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t have to be within the nuclear family, but someone who is a relatively close</p>
<p>relative, that&rsquo;s what they liked to do.</p>
<p>So there are only three guys who would fit the bill.</p>
<p>And the other two are kind of also rants.</p>
<p>They are not they&rsquo;ve nowhere near Octavian&rsquo;s talent.</p>
<p>Caesar&rsquo;s not a healthy man.</p>
<p>He had epilepsy.</p>
<p>Right. Either epilepsy or a series of mini strokes.</p>
<p>The the the medical Sherlock Holmes who&rsquo;ve looked at it disagree.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not entirely clear.</p>
<p>But, yeah, he had problems.</p>
<p>It had occurred to him, I&rsquo;m sure, that he might not last that much longer.</p>
<p>But also think about this.</p>
<p>You know, where&rsquo;s Cleopatra when Caesar&rsquo;s assassinated?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s in Rome.</p>
<p>Oh, she&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t think about it because it&rsquo;s not in Shakespeare,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s in all the ancient sources.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s there. And so where is she living?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s living in Caesar&rsquo;s palace.</p>
<p>Actually, he calls it Caesar&rsquo;s villa.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s across the Tiber.</p>
<p>She can&rsquo;t live in Rome because foreign monarchs are not allowed to enter</p>
<p>the sacred space of the city of Rome.</p>
<p>But she&rsquo;s living across the Tiber.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s good evidence that she was pregnant at the time.</p>
<p>So she and Julia Caesar are still having their affair.</p>
<p>Even though Caesar&rsquo;s wife, Calpurnia, is in Rome.</p>
<p>Apparently, she she miscarries.</p>
<p>But she&rsquo;s going to have another child by her.</p>
<p>And just just to be fun, it should have been a boy also.</p>
<p>And then we could have had all kinds of weirdness breakout.</p>
<p>So we could have all kinds of weirdness.</p>
<p>OK, so we can&rsquo;t stop this conversation, though,</p>
<p>without getting into the military stuff a little bit,</p>
<p>because ancient naval warfare has never made complete sense to me.</p>
<p>Because, you know, when one thinks of the I mean, let&rsquo;s imagine a 400</p>
<p>ship fleet in trying to operate without,</p>
<p>you know, communications in the sort of sense that we would think or I mean, how</p>
<p>this this goes back to the Xerxes not having word document type stuff.</p>
<p>But I mean, I can&rsquo;t I try to imagine how something like this</p>
<p>even is coordinated in a leadership kind of sense.</p>
<p>I mean, and how I mean, we understand Rams because Rams</p>
<p>have always been in my mind as part of the end.</p>
<p>But the thing that I can&rsquo;t make sense of is all of the the missile</p>
<p>weapons involved, right?</p>
<p>The catapult.</p>
<p>Talk to us a little bit about how ancient naval warfare might have functioned.</p>
<p>Well, you know, it depends who, where and when there are there are fleets</p>
<p>that are elegant and they fight elegantly and with maneuverability.</p>
<p>So the Athenian fleet in the classical period, the example of that par excellence.</p>
<p>And there are other navies that don&rsquo;t have this good seamanship.</p>
<p>They go for a heft.</p>
<p>And the Roman navies are generally the latter sort.</p>
<p>The Romans like to basically use their ships</p>
<p>as floating manpower platforms, and they would send in the Marines</p>
<p>from ship to ship, but they would do ramming as well.</p>
<p>The Egyptian navy is a Greek navy, and they&rsquo;re much better at ramming.</p>
<p>And Antony and Cleopatra ships have reinforced prowess,</p>
<p>which means that they can do if they do head on ramming,</p>
<p>they have an advantage.</p>
<p>So if they can ram into the enemy&rsquo;s fleet at first,</p>
<p>they can do very serious damage.</p>
<p>For Octavian and Agrippa&rsquo;s fleet, they can do some ramming,</p>
<p>but for them, missile weapons and boarding are,</p>
<p>I think, are going to be more likely tactics.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;ve had a lot of experience, so they can do some ramming as well</p>
<p>by this point.</p>
<p>To your earlier question of how when you have 400 ships,</p>
<p>how do you coordinate this?</p>
<p>It has to be done in segments.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re not going to be it&rsquo;s very difficult to have the entire battle</p>
<p>line working in coordination.</p>
<p>As you say, the communications ability was quite primitive.</p>
<p>And yet they did communicate with flags,</p>
<p>with trumpet blasts, with shields and swords that had,</p>
<p>you know, they use flashing shield and swords for signals.</p>
<p>And they had small ships that went from ship to ship to send signals.</p>
<p>So they weren&rsquo;t totally in the dark in one of these battles.</p>
<p>But yeah, it&rsquo;s really difficult and really loud.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s going to have to be a lot.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be a lot of chaos in a naval battle.</p>
<p>So help me understand this better,</p>
<p>because one of the things that fascinates me about the pre-modern era</p>
<p>are these questions about whether or not early.</p>
<p>So if I said to you to set up the question, if I said to you,</p>
<p>how would an army from the Franco-Prussian War</p>
<p>in the in the 1870s fare against a Second World War army?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a ludicrous question for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not so ludicrous when you go to the pre-modern era, right?</p>
<p>I mean, could Alexander&rsquo;s army have defeated a Viking force?</p>
<p>Yeah, probably.</p>
<p>So my question is, is how was this going in naval warfare?</p>
<p>If we had a battle, if you could bring back the Athenian fleet</p>
<p>from Salamis or something from that era to fight a Roman fleet</p>
<p>in the era of Augustus Caesar, is that something that is a thing</p>
<p>or is that going to be an outrageously one sided thing?</p>
<p>And if so, why?</p>
<p>Well, it depends. It&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>And it depends where the battle is fought.</p>
<p>The Athenians went at Salamis, remember, because they set up the battle.</p>
<p>Again, Sun Tzu setting up the battle in the perfect place for them</p>
<p>geographically in the narrow Salamis Straits.</p>
<p>With the island there and everything. Yes.</p>
<p>Yes. With the Persians who have outnumbered them and have faster ships</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t use that advantage.</p>
<p>So if the I think if it&rsquo;s a battle is going to be fought on open water,</p>
<p>that the Romans are going to have an advantage against the Athenians,</p>
<p>particularly if they have in general, their ships had reinforced</p>
<p>prows compared to what they were like in the age of the triremes.</p>
<p>So they will have that advantage.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re better at ramming.</p>
<p>And they have missile technology that the Athenians don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They have they have much bigger ships.</p>
<p>Their ships are clunkier.</p>
<p>But as long as they can get in there and ram, I think they are</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re likely to win.</p>
<p>But that being said, so, you know, earlier when Agrippa and Octavian</p>
<p>were fighting Sextus Pompey in the decade before Actium,</p>
<p>they had to build a navy from scratch.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t really have a navy.</p>
<p>Rome would have these great navies, which is what used against Carthage.</p>
<p>And then it would let naval technology go down.</p>
<p>And then you get someone like Pompey and he and his family</p>
<p>specialized in building new navies.</p>
<p>Pompey&rsquo;s ships, fleets were very maneuverable.</p>
<p>And at first, Octavian and Agrippa&rsquo;s fleets weren&rsquo;t maneuverable.</p>
<p>They had to reinvent the navy.</p>
<p>They had to come up with new technology.</p>
<p>They had a kind of harpoon that they used to attach themselves to the enemy ship.</p>
<p>And they got enemy admirals to defect to their fleet to give away</p>
<p>the enemy&rsquo;s secrets and also to help them improve their maneuverability.</p>
<p>But remember, the other thing to remember about Octavian and Agrippa is,</p>
<p>as you said earlier, they win these naval battles partly on land.</p>
<p>They always attack the enemy&rsquo;s land bases and the enemy&rsquo;s logistics</p>
<p>so that the enemy is left with a fleet that can can&rsquo;t fight very well</p>
<p>because they can&rsquo;t feed the men very well.</p>
<p>And Anthony actually has to burn some of his ships,</p>
<p>a lot of his ships before before the Battle of Actium.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this this really great strategic vision and the ability to to cut off</p>
<p>the enemy before the enemy can actually fight.</p>
<p>That contributes so much to their success.</p>
<p>All right. Let&rsquo;s talk about getting back to our Shakespeare</p>
<p>romantic parts of the story or romantic is a weird word</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking about suicide.</p>
<p>But but Cleopatra&rsquo;s famous death</p>
<p>by the bite of the asp, supposedly, or whatnot.</p>
<p>First of all, why did she have to die?</p>
<p>Why was this a setup situation where this was perceived as the necessary step?</p>
<p>And then let&rsquo;s talk about what we know about the reality or lack</p>
<p>thereof of the actual event itself.</p>
<p>Sure. So I think that Cleopatra was a problem for Octavian</p>
<p>as long as she was around.</p>
<p>First of all, he declared war on Cleopatra.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t declare a war on Antony.</p>
<p>And generally you not you often march the enemy general in the triumph.</p>
<p>And then you had him kill the Caesar did with Ferus and Gatorix.</p>
<p>The problem with that is that Octavian knew that Cleopatra would win</p>
<p>the sympathy of the Roman public as a mother, as a woman</p>
<p>that already had this problem with her sister, that the Romans did not want</p>
<p>to have have killed, killed earlier.</p>
<p>So he feared that she would live.</p>
<p>And as long as she lived, she is dangerous.</p>
<p>This is one dangerous person.</p>
<p>I mean, she&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s cunning. She&rsquo;s charming. She&rsquo;s seductive.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not great for Antony to have around.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the problem of her son.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s he going to do?</p>
<p>You know, Antony can&rsquo;t allow Tolomei Caesar, Caesarean to live.</p>
<p>You mean Octavian can&rsquo;t allow that?</p>
<p>Excuse me. Octavian can&rsquo;t allow Tolomei Caesar to to live.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s he going to do?</p>
<p>Kill him and then say to Cleopatra, no hard feelings.</p>
<p>You know, just just come to Rome.</p>
<p>No, she&rsquo;s she is a major, major problem.</p>
<p>She also was Caesar&rsquo;s lover.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not great for him, you know, because he wants to be Caesar.</p>
<p>Nobody else can have a piece of Caesar.</p>
<p>So there are all sorts of reasons why he wants her off the stage.</p>
<p>And he most definitely wants her oldest son off the stage.</p>
<p>And explain what happens to him.</p>
<p>Caesarean, yes.</p>
<p>So so Cleopatra understands that he&rsquo;s not long for this world.</p>
<p>Once Octavian enters Alexandria, she sends him south</p>
<p>with a trusted aide, his his tutor.</p>
<p>And they are on their way to India.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to go to the Red Sea coast, take ship and go to India.</p>
<p>And earlier, Cleopatra and Antony had hoped that they could go to India as well.</p>
<p>But their enemies burned their fleets.</p>
<p>And there are and there we should say there are successor Greek states in in parts of</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s now Pakistan.</p>
<p>But there are there are places to go with with a cultural affinity</p>
<p>for for Cleopatra&rsquo;s background, kind of.</p>
<p>Excellent point. Excellent point.</p>
<p>That is true. Yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, his tutor betrays Caesarean.</p>
<p>He wants to be on the side of the winners.</p>
<p>So he either kills Caesarean or brings him back to Alexandria and says, you know,</p>
<p>Gaius Julius Caesar, Octavian is your brother.</p>
<p>He wants to welcome you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re both the sons of Julius Caesar.</p>
<p>And then he is executed.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s executed in Alexandria.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s again, it&rsquo;s interesting to think of the of the murderous.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a godfather sort of feel to some of this, where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the heir and and kin of Julius Caesar that snuffs out the true heir of.</p>
<p>I mean, the end of the Roman Republic and the beginning of the empire is so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a Sopranos kind of a vibe to the whole thing.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s definitely so.</p>
<p>So what? And we&rsquo;ll leave it with this.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ll actually leave it with me asking you if I left anything out.</p>
<p>But I would love to find out what you think the average well-educated, well-informed</p>
<p>person should know about these events 2000 years later.</p>
<p>Well, that is a great question.</p>
<p>I think they should know, first of all, that battles and wars really do matter.</p>
<p>If this had gone the other way, we would be speaking the language today.</p>
<p>We might well be speaking a language today with a Greek base rather than a Latin base</p>
<p>to the extent that Western culture is a Christian culture, be more like Orthodox Christianity</p>
<p>than Western Christian.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating. Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>And I think that Western civilization would look eastward in many ways.</p>
<p>It would be more like Islamic civilization than the civilization that develops in in</p>
<p>Europe later. And the Roman heritage would have been much even more.</p>
<p>It was a Greco-Roman heritage, but it would have been even more of a Greco-Roman</p>
<p>heritage. So that&rsquo;s one thing.</p>
<p>Another thing is that, as you said, strategy is the most important thing in a war.</p>
<p>And you can have the best weapons and the most money and you still lose because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>exactly what happened to Antony and Cleopatra.</p>
<p>And of course, there are some more recent examples as well.</p>
<p>So this, I think, is a permanent lesson.</p>
<p>And then something you said earlier, just the fascinating importance of character and</p>
<p>personality. And, you know, Antony said when Octavian was first starting, he said, oh,</p>
<p>that guy, he&rsquo;s nothing but a name.</p>
<p>He has nothing but Caesar.</p>
<p>The name is Caesar. But that wasn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>The guy was just immensely talented.</p>
<p>He was just a genius when it came to the art of politics and strategy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the ultimate reason why he succeeds.</p>
<p>What haven&rsquo;t I asked you about that&rsquo;s worth talking about in this?</p>
<p>Your book had so many different, wonderful little avenues, and I just touched upon some</p>
<p>of them. Maybe you can give me an idea of the question that I didn&rsquo;t ask you.</p>
<p>Did you want to know about the Asp?</p>
<p>Sure. I always want to know about the Asp.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s foremost in my mind most of the time.</p>
<p>You did mention it before.</p>
<p>Are we talking cobra here or is this something else?</p>
<p>Multiple cobras, baby cobras.</p>
<p>What are we talking about?</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re talking baby cobras.</p>
<p>First of all, there are some scholars who say this is all made up.</p>
<p>Octavian had her assassinated and he makes up this fairy story about the.</p>
<p>That could be true.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe I just I find that really hard to believe because all the ancient sources</p>
<p>buy it. And there are people there at the time in Cleopatra&rsquo;s court who write memoirs.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;re so scared of Antony, of Octavian, that they aren&rsquo;t going to say,</p>
<p>oh, by the way, she didn&rsquo;t commit suicide.</p>
<p>I actually think that she and Octavian made a deal that if she committed suicide, he would</p>
<p>let her three children by Antony live and he kept his side of the bargain.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of my guess.</p>
<p>So I see it as a scene in The Godfather when Tommy Hagen tells Frankie Fantangeli, you</p>
<p>know, to commit suicide in the bath like the old Roman emperors.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t worry about your family.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a General Rommel situation.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s kind of how I see it with Cleopatra.</p>
<p>I was very skeptical of the asp because the ancient sources say we don&rsquo;t know if it was</p>
<p>an if it was an asp, a snake.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a generic word for a snake or if it was poison.</p>
<p>And I consulted a colleague of mine, a herpetologist, and he said there&rsquo;s no problem.</p>
<p>It could have been it could have been a baby cobra.</p>
<p>It could easily have been a baby cobra that would have done the job just fine.</p>
<p>So I came away a believer thinking sometimes weird things happen in history.</p>
<p>And this is just one of those weird things.</p>
<p>And you pointed out the connection between the cobra and the ancient, even by then,</p>
<p>pharaonic Egypt connection to the snake and her being the last in this line and the</p>
<p>first one to speak Egypt, Egyptian.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a whole there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s so much symbolism that that makes me</p>
<p>question the the the history, historicity of it.</p>
<p>But, you know, and maybe we&rsquo;ll leave it at this because I don&rsquo;t want to open up a whole</p>
<p>other can of worms. But I love the fact and you just alluded to it, how much an ancient</p>
<p>person or a person, you know, in in a hundred A.D.</p>
<p>would have had in a library sense in terms of research materials from primary sources</p>
<p>that have been gone for two thousand years to find out.</p>
<p>I mean, like you said, Octavian&rsquo;s got memoirs.</p>
<p>A lot of the people involved in this thing wrote stories.</p>
<p>I mean, if they find a buried library someday from the ancient world where we can</p>
<p>translate the documents, those are the kind of things weirdos like yours truly dream</p>
<p>about. Professor Strauss, this is wonderful.</p>
<p>The book is wonderful. And thank you for illuminating a bunch of this stuff that&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>to imagine without some guidance.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very welcome. Thanks for the conversation.</p>
<p>My thanks to Professor Barry Strauss for coming on the program today and talking about</p>
<p>this absolutely critical naval battle at this hinge point between two important periods in</p>
<p>human history, the transition from the Roman Republic to what we&rsquo;ll call later the Roman</p>
<p>Empire. His new book is called The War That Made the Roman Empire, Antony Cleopatra and</p>
<p>Octavian at Actium.</p>
<p>He is an expert in ancient naval warfare, by the way.</p>
<p>And if that is something you like, he&rsquo;s got a great book on the Battle of Salamis and the</p>
<p>Greek and Persian Wars.</p>
<p>Also, he wrote one on the death of Julius Caesar called The Death of Caesar.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s got several books you may want to check out.</p>
<p>This one on Actium is a wonderful reminder for me as I read it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a deep dive on this stuff about what it signifies for these ancient societies.</p>
<p>I mean, to be able to put 600 giant wooden ships on the waves, coordinate their activities,</p>
<p>feed their crews.</p>
<p>I mean, the number of things involved to me without any of our modern tools just reminds</p>
<p>me that our ancestors were very clever and these societies were more sophisticated and</p>
<p>capable than we commonly think they were.</p>
<p>I also and we&rsquo;ve talked about this before, there&rsquo;s nobody who&rsquo;s seen anything like what</p>
<p>the Battle of Actium looked like.</p>
<p>I feel the same way about land battles in the ancient world.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve talked about how I would love to have, although it would probably give me PTSD</p>
<p>later, a hot air balloon hovering over one of these ancient land battles to see what</p>
<p>it looked like, because nobody knows.</p>
<p>And the ancient writers left out key points because, well, if people 500 years from now</p>
<p>were reading about one of our wars, we&rsquo;re not going to explain common things like what</p>
<p>a gun is and how a bullet fires and what that looks like and how, you know, we assume that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re aware of certain realities, but eventually they won&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>And so no one knows really what ancient warfare looked like on land or at sea.</p>
<p>All I can say is this.</p>
<p>If you study naval history, you&rsquo;ll notice that there are lots of naval battles that</p>
<p>have lots of ships in history.</p>
<p>So the Battle of Leyte Gulf in the Second World War, a naval battle famously with</p>
<p>hundreds and hundreds of ships, right?</p>
<p>Just like the Battle of Actium.</p>
<p>The difference, though, is at the Battle of Leyte Gulf, these ships are spread out over</p>
<p>hundreds and hundreds of miles of ocean, a huge area.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not all congregated in a small space, but at Actium they are and at Salamis</p>
<p>they are. I mean, what do 600 ships on the waves at the same time in one place that can</p>
<p>all see each other?</p>
<p>I mean, what does that look like?</p>
<p>And when they start hurling bolts and stones at each other from a distance and then</p>
<p>javelins and arrows as they get closer and the Marines start boarding hull to hull, I</p>
<p>just visually I can&rsquo;t picture it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I need a time machine and my hot air balloon, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to spend all my money on a hot air balloon, as I&rsquo;ve said, to hover over an</p>
<p>ancient land battle so that I can get an idea of what it really looks like, right?</p>
<p>The physics of ancient warfare, as I always call it.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a physics of ancient naval warfare, too.</p>
<p>And I have just as much of a hard time imagining what the heck that&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>Thanks to Barry Strauss for helping clear some of that up in the war that made the</p>
<p>Roman Empire. Now, the semi-legendary pseudo-mythical producer of this program is</p>
<p>once again on my case about not pushing merchandise hard enough to you folks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not much of a self-promoter.</p>
<p>He says, is it too much trouble to just say we have hats and T-shirts available?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not. So we do.</p>
<p>And if you want those, they&rsquo;re available from DanCarlin.com.</p>
<p>Also, as you probably know, we also have, in addition to the free shows that are always</p>
<p>available, after a couple of years, we cycle those things into the paid archives and we</p>
<p>charge what we hope you think is a fair price for those programs.</p>
<p>I, of course, would want to redo every one of those programs, but I am told by listeners</p>
<p>that they appreciate watching the evolution of this show, which was going at the time</p>
<p>hand in hand with the evolution of the podcasting medium.</p>
<p>Standards were different in 2006, for example, but there&rsquo;s something interesting about</p>
<p>watch, just like watching old television shows, I guess.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to see, you know, how they did things back in the old days compared to</p>
<p>how we do things now.</p>
<p>Hey, was certainly shorter and sweeter back then, wasn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>In any case, if you&rsquo;re interested in that, that&rsquo;s available from the website, too.</p>
<p>We live in interesting times, as always, everyone.</p>
<p>Please stay safe.</p>
<p>If you think the show you just heard is worth a dollar, Dan and Ben would love to have it.</p>
