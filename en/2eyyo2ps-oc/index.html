<p>because i wasn&rsquo;t sure about the other</p>
<p>one um so my question is last summer i</p>
<p>was doing some extended fasting i had</p>
<p>worked my way up and i was coming off of</p>
<p>a 55-hour fast and um in the efforts to</p>
<p>maintain ketosis as much as i could i um</p>
<p>broke the fast with a relatively high</p>
<p>fat meal i think i ate olives and eggs</p>
<p>and avocado</p>
<p>and shortly after eating i ended up</p>
<p>having</p>
<p>a lot of like heart palpitations and it</p>
<p>was really fast and really hot beating</p>
<p>really hard and so um that kind of</p>
<p>scared me off from fasting i really</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t done extended fasting since then</p>
<p>and so i&rsquo;m wondering if you could kind</p>
<p>of help me out and tell me what i did</p>
<p>wrong and um kind of give me the</p>
<p>confidence to get back on the horse so</p>
<p>to speak</p>
<p>hey listen i did the same exact thing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like you fast forward</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called that&rsquo;s definitely a</p>
<p>definition of prolonged fasting so what</p>
<p>happens when you fast for that long is</p>
<p>your insulin um</p>
<p>receptors get very receptive i mean</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just like wide open and so when</p>
<p>you eat that meal wow you&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>shift in</p>
<p>electrolytes</p>
<p>and certain nutrients um won&rsquo;t get into</p>
<p>too much detail with that but i will say</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>you got to ease into it very very</p>
<p>gradually</p>
<p>because you can end up with</p>
<p>what happens is like you need a certain</p>
<p>amount of potassium</p>
<p>inside the cell</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>if your body sucks in too much potassium</p>
<p>too fast you can end up with low</p>
<p>potassium in the in the blood and that</p>
<p>can create um pulse rate going up heart</p>
<p>rate going up</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>the best way to do it</p>
<p>is to have uh</p>
<p>just a little bit of food maybe like one</p>
<p>olive maybe a little uh and one</p>
<p>one egg</p>
<p>wait for a couple hours</p>
<p>maybe a little bit of salad</p>
<p>wait for a couple hours have some nuts</p>
<p>something like that because um</p>
<p>because what i did is i</p>
<p>i ate just a ton of food and i end up</p>
<p>getting really sick so it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>something i i have videos on all the</p>
<p>details you can watch that but</p>
<p>i think you should get back right back</p>
<p>on it because you probably experienced</p>
<p>some cool benefits it&rsquo;s just that</p>
<p>you got to go really really uh slow into</p>
<p>that first meal</p>
<p>thank you that&rsquo;s great well thanks</p>
<p>thanks so much melanie for a great</p>
<p>kickoff to our green room participants</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see and the worst and the</p>
<p>worst thing and the worst thing you</p>
<p>could do</p>
<p>is um have uh refined carbs like when</p>
<p>you come off a long</p>
<p>long term fast which i don&rsquo;t think you</p>
<p>did that but you had i think you had</p>
<p>some other things but</p>
<p>yeah so</p>
<p>one thing not to consume</p>
<p>is too much of any one macro especially</p>
<p>carbs</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s fantastic well i&rsquo;d hear it</p>

<p>years that&rsquo;s a pretty good track record</p>
<p>and especially since um</p>
<p>um they&rsquo;re only</p>
<p>70 years old so i&rsquo;m trying to figure</p>
<p>that out</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>yeah yeah well that&rsquo;s wonderful</p>

<p>that&rsquo;s fantastic and look at your look</p>
<p>at your progeny go and what a proud</p>
<p>moment that is all right let&rsquo;s see uh</p>
<p>wasp from youtube i have had two kids by</p>
<p>cesarean section i&rsquo;m having problems</p>
<p>with my bones my mood and energy what</p>
<p>should i do to stay fit and active</p>
<p>did they did they give us any</p>
<p>description of what what they&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>or not</p>
<p>no unfortunately not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just one of those things that you</p>
<p>can have those symptoms from</p>
<p>any number of things it&rsquo;s really hard to</p>
<p>tell you what to do</p>
<p>other than get on the basic plan to try</p>
<p>to see what you&rsquo;re eating because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard to evaluate</p>
<p>all those symptoms with if i don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>other data especially with what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating so i&rsquo;m going to recommend that</p>
<p>you ask the question again but just give</p>
<p>me a little background of what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating just so i can have that idea</p>
<p>okay devry from youtube isn&rsquo;t having a</p>
<p>lot of fun i&rsquo;ve been on keto for a few</p>
<p>months and a lot only lost 10 pounds</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t feel very energetic feels kind</p>
<p>of crappy only eats two small meals and</p>
<p>drinks a bottle of water a day what else</p>
<p>should</p>
<p>i be doing she asks</p>
<p>if if you&rsquo;re struggling and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to lose weight and that&rsquo;s the and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing keto the first thing out of</p>
<p>all the things you should change is just</p>
<p>go to one meal a day</p>
<p>one meal a day in fact that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing right now um</p>
<p>and um i just just recently started just</p>
<p>doing one me i&rsquo;m like what am i eating</p>
<p>two meals a day for i&rsquo;m not even at all</p>
<p>hungry for it so uh one meal a day and</p>
<p>one little tip on that just to</p>
<p>as the icing on the cake to make it a</p>
<p>little bit better</p>
<p>if you could have that one meal</p>
<p>no later than three o&rsquo;clock in the</p>
<p>afternoon you&rsquo;ll be aligning</p>
<p>with your um</p>
<p>natural rhythms in the body and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>probably end up having better blood</p>
<p>sugars better weight loss</p>
<p>better sleep</p>
<p>versus eating that one meal later in the</p>
<p>day so even if you have two meals</p>
<p>shipped it more in the morning the</p>
<p>second thing i would look at would be</p>
<p>making bring your carbs down to as close</p>
<p>to zero as possible i have a video on</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s um if i&rsquo;m not mistaken it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s either called keto on steroids or</p>
<p>extreme</p>
<p>weight loss</p>
<p>or screen extreme fat burning so you</p>
<p>look up those videos on how to bring</p>
<p>your</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>your carbs as close to zero as possible</p>
<p>the third thing</p>
<p>is uh your fat um the more fat you have</p>
<p>the more your body is going to burn that</p>
<p>is energy and not your own fat so at</p>
<p>this stage if you really need to lose</p>
<p>weight</p>
<p>cut back some of that fat not in low fat</p>
<p>but about 75 grams</p>
<p>and then the other thing is exercise so</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what your exercise routine</p>
<p>is but we will be chatting a little bit</p>
<p>on that so stay tuned for a little bit</p>
<p>more information on that but i think we</p>
<p>get this question every single week so i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s an important one and guess</p>
<p>what um</p>
<p>if you are on our list if you sign up</p>
<p>for my email list i&rsquo;m going to be doing</p>
<p>actually probably next week or the week</p>
<p>following i will be doing a</p>
<p>two different webinars and they&rsquo;re both</p>
<p>on keto the first webinar is going to be</p>
<p>for people starting keto the second one</p>
<p>is people that want to</p>
<p>bust through their plateau and these</p>
<p>webinars are just q a</p>
<p>for an hour</p>
<p>so that way you can have the full</p>
<p>information they&rsquo;re not going to be</p>
<p>recorded so you won&rsquo;t see them on</p>
<p>youtube they&rsquo;re all they&rsquo;re just live</p>
<p>events so we&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>trying it out and see how see how that</p>
<p>helps people second one is through</p>
<p>people that want to</p>
<p>bust through them</p>
<p>hang on just a moment let me someone is</p>
<p>going through there we go oh we got our</p>
<p>viewer from india back so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>terrific we&rsquo;ll get to her shortly and by</p>
<p>the way folks all that dr berg described</p>
<p>is available to you at dr berg.com so go</p>
<p>there and from there you&rsquo;ll be able to</p>
<p>find out everything about live</p>
<p>broadcasts and great videos etc dr</p>
<p>berg.com</p>
<p>if i if i can add one thing to that</p>
<p>steve i um there is another place where</p>
<p>you could find all these videos and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a it&rsquo;s actually my new app it&rsquo;s a free</p>
<p>app you can download it off you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>searching on your cell phone and it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>dr berg app and we have all the videos</p>
<p>on there we have quizzes we have some</p>
<p>really cool stuff but we just had a new</p>
<p>redesign i think you guys will like it</p>
<p>so definitely go download that just in</p>
<p>case something happens with youtube you</p>
<p>have a backup of all my videos okay so</p>
<p>you never know when you might need a</p>
<p>video wonderful</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrific all right our first</p>
<p>question today asks why are diabetics</p>
<p>always so thirsty</p>
<p>and 85 of her respondents say that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>body trying to eliminate excess sugar</p>
<p>through frequent urination</p>
<p>and then the other 15 say is because of</p>
<p>low potassium levels</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>so what happens in the body is that</p>
<p>water flows</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>glucose so</p>
<p>a diabetic is losing sugar okay for the</p>
<p>urine it&rsquo;s going right through the</p>
<p>kidneys and so with that sugar comes the</p>
<p>water to follow</p>
<p>and that also applies to</p>
<p>the more carbs that you eat the more</p>
<p>water you&rsquo;re going to retain</p>
<p>and this is why when you go on keto and</p>
<p>you go low carb you lose all this water</p>
<p>so you no longer are a fluid-filled</p>
<p>sponge and how much water roughly on</p>
<p>average probably about 13 pounds but if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a bigger person it could be more</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>a person that&rsquo;s carboned out all the</p>
<p>time they&rsquo;re carrying a lot of extra uh</p>
<p>glycogen and that&rsquo;s stored sugar with a</p>
<p>lot of extra</p>
<p>water that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so i guess one molecule one gram of um</p>
<p>of glucose stores</p>
<p>up to three grams of water</p>
<p>so you can imagine</p>
<p>uh how much water most people are</p>
<p>carrying around it&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>wow that&rsquo;s incredible and by the way</p>
<p>whenever we do the shout out for people</p>
<p>that seems to spur other people into</p>
<p>action so in addition to those that we</p>
<p>spoke of earlier we also have viewers</p>
<p>from poland serbia bolivia hong kong the</p>
<p>congo egypt kenya turkey albania and</p>
<p>costa rica so welcome you folks to as</p>
<p>rounds out the globe i think so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see and before i lose uh delicia again i</p>
<p>want to try to get her on the air and</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s our visitor and respondent from</p>
<p>india and alicia if you&rsquo;ll unmute</p>
<p>yourself you&rsquo;re on with dr bird</p>
<p>hello</p>
<p>good hello</p>
<p>good morning</p>
<p>yes so i have this one question that no</p>
<p>since i&rsquo;m in india and here we are more</p>
<p>prone to eating a lot of carbohydrates</p>
<p>i would like to know what exactly would</p>
<p>be a diet of an indian in terms of going</p>
<p>low carb or doing intermittent fasting</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>a lot of people also here do not eat</p>
<p>beef you know like you&rsquo;ve suggested in</p>
<p>your videos</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not really convenient to find</p>
<p>the beef</p>
<p>said</p>
<p>wild caught fish</p>
<p>in our diet so what would you suggest as</p>
<p>an alternative</p>
<p>well i just have to say that</p>
<p>indian is one of my favorite foods i</p>
<p>mean it&rsquo;s incredible the taste of the</p>
<p>spices are just off the charts so i&rsquo;d</p>
<p>like to</p>
<p>congratulate you on that and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>probably it&rsquo;s wonderful living there to</p>
<p>get all these wonderful spices but it</p>
<p>comes with a package because</p>
<p>um out of all the foods um india</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>in their jeans in their culture in the</p>
<p>ceremonies and all the different parties</p>
<p>and rituals and things like that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of</p>
<p>sugar going on and uh i&rsquo;m sure at social</p>
<p>activities it&rsquo;s like if you don&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>the sugar you&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>you know shunted away from the group but</p>
<p>i i would you&rsquo;re gonna have to start a</p>
<p>new trend unfortunately because</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>we do have an indian channel and i do</p>
<p>have some indian recipes</p>
<p>if you look under dr berg&rsquo;s channel</p>
<p>under different channels because we have</p>
<p>a recipe a lot of different recipes for</p>
<p>indian food but let me let me tell you</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a um even a local</p>
<p>guy that i have that um</p>
<p>he does indian dishes without all the</p>
<p>sugar and so for example the rice would</p>
<p>be cauliflower</p>
<p>he uses all the spices</p>
<p>but he uses stevia instead of sugar so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a matter of reformulating some</p>
<p>of these recipes because i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>why they need to add the sugar with it i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think it adds</p>
<p>a better flavor um</p>
<p>but i will say that even like in local</p>
<p>eating restaurants around america you</p>
<p>have</p>
<p>they dump so much sugar in the sauces</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t know why in the curries like</p>
<p>why can&rsquo;t you just have the spices boy</p>
<p>if you could just um</p>
<p>someone i&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s you could</p>
<p>probably even come up with</p>
<p>um some recipes of traditional indian</p>
<p>foods and just</p>
<p>substitute the sugars</p>
<p>to play around with that i think a lot</p>
<p>of people would go for these recipes</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that is a</p>
<p>a delicious food with that comes with a</p>
<p>package</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t have uh</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t have a an easy answer other than</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to start a new</p>
<p>trend</p>
<p>be a trendsetter</p>
<p>yes i think i totally take</p>
<p>it here also another thing that i wanted</p>
<p>to ask you is that is intermittent</p>
<p>fasting suitable for women physiology</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of also there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of research there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>information around which states that if</p>
<p>you have a hormonal imbalance or if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re somebody who has any kind of</p>
<p>issues with your hormones then and also</p>
<p>since you&rsquo;re a woman and you go around</p>
<p>this 30 days spiritual cycle</p>
<p>you cannot go off carbs because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to just</p>
<p>you know be a disaster</p>
<p>is that true and to what extent is that</p>
<p>true</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d like to find the person who started</p>
<p>those rumors because it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>like the question you have to ask is</p>
<p>this um</p>
<p>why</p>
<p>in what way</p>
<p>would adding carbs help your hormones</p>
<p>i mean that doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me</p>
<p>like okay so</p>
<p>in what way does adding more insulin to</p>
<p>your bloodstream improve your female</p>
<p>hormones</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t it doesn&rsquo;t help you in any</p>
<p>way shape or form so all we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>with keto is we&rsquo;re reducing that insulin</p>
<p>excess</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re bringing things back to normal</p>
<p>fertility issues may occur if you</p>
<p>do long prolonged fasting but then</p>
<p>things come back</p>
<p>also</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re eating dirty keto and not</p>
<p>nutrient dense healthy keto which one i</p>
<p>recommend that can create problems but</p>
<p>it is true that</p>
<p>your thyroid hormone may go down a bit</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s only it&rsquo;s still within the</p>
<p>normal range but it&rsquo;s not classified as</p>
<p>hypogly uh hypothyroidism because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no change that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>occur with your</p>
<p>your thyroid stimulating hormone but the</p>
<p>the factor that um</p>
<p>diet helps you</p>
<p>you know diagnose hypothyroidism there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a change there it&rsquo;s going to be just</p>
<p>with maybe t4 or t3</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s just because you&rsquo;re running</p>
<p>on a different</p>
<p>more efficient system that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>as far as fertility issues</p>
<p>i think you&rsquo;ll become more fertile if</p>
<p>you do</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>um keto and in a version of intermittent</p>
<p>fasting because you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re healing</p>
<p>the endocrine system you&rsquo;re taking a</p>
<p>person out of the sympathetic</p>
<p>mode</p>
<p>um and then also if you ever hear</p>
<p>someone tell you that</p>
<p>um get a reference right and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna give you a reference</p>
<p>involving a mice study or a mouse study</p>
<p>or a rat study whatever and then when</p>
<p>you read this study you&rsquo;re like wait a</p>
<p>second</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not even on keto they&rsquo;re on a</p>
<p>high fat diet with a high sugar diet so</p>
<p>again it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a little bit of bad information goes a</p>
<p>long way it&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>we know that tomatoes reduce your risk</p>
<p>of prostate cancer so then start eating</p>
<p>more pizza that&rsquo;s the logic</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re using there</p>
<p>yes that&rsquo;s very clear</p>
<p>thank you very much for that</p>
<p>and also to relieve</p>
<p>gut health and what would you say about</p>
<p>coffee on a keto</p>
<p>will it not affect your gut health is it</p>
<p>okay to have coffee on an empty stomach</p>
<p>when you go on fasting</p>
<p>99 of the time it&rsquo;s going to be fine</p>
<p>especially if you do organic coffee</p>
<p>if you do regular coffee there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of pesticides and who knows what that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to create</p>
<p>also the water that you use to make the</p>
<p>coffee if that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tap water that could be a problem</p>
<p>because the chlorine but typically</p>
<p>coffee has some benefits in small doses</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>i have not found a lot of problems with</p>
<p>coffee even a little caffeine</p>
<p>is going to be fine but</p>
<p>my cup is very small</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>simply because i used to do a lot of</p>
<p>coffee and now i don&rsquo;t because uh i</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just uh it affects my body but the</p>
<p>point is that just coffee is not going</p>
<p>to be a problem at all it can actually</p>
<p>even help you in various ways i did a</p>
<p>video you can search out on the benefits</p>
<p>of coffee</p>
<p>great well delisha thank you so much for</p>
<p>joining us uh from india that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fantastic</p>
<p>and uh we&rsquo;d love to hear back from you</p>
<p>on your progress</p>
<p>with your various eating habits and so</p>
<p>on all right dr</p>
<p>berg let&rsquo;s go to the next question and</p>
<p>here it is</p>
<p>all right true or false</p>
<p>protein triggers</p>
<p>insulin</p>
<p>if i can&rsquo;t i can&rsquo;t even release</p>
<p>police yeah is it true or false protein</p>
<p>triggers insulin release</p>
<p>all right dig into that audience okay</p>

<p>yeah our kids are being</p>
<p>bathed in an environment that is very</p>
<p>estrogenic</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>of the amount of plastics</p>
<p>in the environment that we&rsquo;re eating in</p>
<p>our foods in the water and also</p>
<p>chemicals</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>any anything like like pesticides</p>
<p>insecticides herbicides uh heavy metals</p>
<p>you know that they&rsquo;re they actually are</p>
<p>estrogenic they actually can</p>
<p>you know start creating too much</p>
<p>estrogen as well</p>
<p>as consuming a lot of the foods</p>
<p>especially like the soy protein isolates</p>
<p>and that type of thing so</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re gonna have to do is um watch</p>
<p>my videos on that start consuming</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>foods that will help clean that up like</p>
<p>cruciferous</p>
<p>like fermented um</p>
<p>like sauerkraut things like that that</p>
<p>your gut health will help</p>
<p>dismantle some of that estrogen and then</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the other thing</p>
<p>especially for um</p>
<p>kids is that uh um</p>
<p>you know you can do a level of fasting</p>
<p>but but don&rsquo;t go too too crazy if</p>
<p>someone is that young</p>
<p>unfortunately right now</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of new chemicals like</p>
<p>glyphosate which is in gml foods that</p>
<p>then disrupts the gut and that creates</p>
<p>other problems but</p>
<p>i think with estrogen dominance</p>
<p>you can you can clean it up if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>now aware of what you&rsquo;re putting in your</p>
<p>body so there&rsquo;s so many things that</p>
<p>trigger estrogen</p>
<p>unfortunately</p>
<p>all right very good noel uh noel from</p>
<p>youtube my blood work indicates i&rsquo;m low</p>
<p>in magnesium so i ordered your lemon</p>
<p>electrolyte powder i love that and trace</p>
<p>minerals is that is that too much to</p>
<p>take</p>
<p>and how much should i take each day</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s not too much i do have a</p>
<p>separate magnesium product but i think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get enough magnesium and</p>
<p>electrolyte powder and the cool thing</p>
<p>about magnesium and also other</p>
<p>electrolytes like potassium is if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>if you have too much your body gets rid</p>
<p>of the excess versus other minerals like</p>
<p>iron that&rsquo;s uh that one that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exit</p>
<p>but also the trace minerals are are</p>
<p>really good and they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>plant-based so they are ancient</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>ancient plants that we take the trace</p>
<p>minerals from so they&rsquo;re in a type of</p>
<p>bond that is really easy for our bodies</p>
<p>to digest and absorb and utilize so</p>
<p>as far as how many if you just do a</p>
<p>minimum of one scoop of electrolytes and</p>
<p>then maybe two of the trace minerals i</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re going to be fine with that</p>
<p>uh if you exercise or you um</p>
<p>sweat you can take more electrolytes but</p>
<p>also take the sea salt with that just to</p>
<p>make sure you don&rsquo;t omit sea salt in the</p>
<p>diet and that way you&rsquo;ll have the</p>
<p>electrolytes you need</p>
<p>all right you know salt is considered</p>
<p>such a</p>
<p>bad thing</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>really</p>
<p>the data is is so mixed on that because</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re not looking at is</p>
<p>any time you look at one thing</p>
<p>one nutrient right yeah</p>
<p>our bodies don&rsquo;t metabolize one one</p>
<p>nutrient as is there&rsquo;s always this</p>
<p>combination of factors</p>
<p>and usually with minerals it comes in</p>
<p>two so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why you need</p>
<p>the ratio of more twice at least twice</p>
<p>as much potassium to sodium so if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>high in sodium and you&rsquo;re having any</p>
<p>symptoms take more</p>
<p>potassium to balance it out and all of a</p>
<p>sudden those symptoms will go away</p>
<p>all right well speaking more about</p>
<p>electrolyte powder uh shrey from youtube</p>
<p>is it okay to have dextrose in my</p>
<p>electrolyte powder</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think you should because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating sugar it&rsquo;s a synthetic sugar too</p>
<p>and unfortunately they um</p>
<p>a lot of electrolyte powders and i won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mention any names gatorade uh but um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just a lot of sugar and just a</p>
<p>few electrolytes and</p>
<p>you know the idea is to exercise deplete</p>
<p>your glycogen and then replace it with</p>
<p>new sugar but</p>
<p>first of all when you exercise</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t lose</p>
<p>a tremendous amount of</p>
<p>glycogen maybe at the very most with the</p>
<p>hardcore workout you lose 30 but your</p>
<p>body is just going to make it right back</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s why we have a thing</p>
<p>called gluconeogenesis</p>
<p>neo meaning new genesis mean the</p>
<p>creation of so</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to replace your glycogen</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to help you recover it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to actually make you worse over</p>
<p>time</p>
<p>all right very good we got some more</p>
<p>answers and the latest one was a true</p>
<p>falsehood protein triggers insulin</p>
<p>release</p>
<p>68 percent of our respondents say false</p>
<p>and about a third of them say it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re counting carbs on keto</p>
<p>the biggest mistake is not realizing</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other things that can also</p>
<p>trigger your insulin because the really</p>
<p>the whole goal of keto is to lower</p>
<p>insulin and carbs will increase insulin</p>
<p>but guess what unfortunately</p>
<p>protein will also do it not to the</p>
<p>degree carbs will but protein will do it</p>
<p>so if</p>
<p>if you took even like uh checked your</p>
<p>blood sugars and you had</p>
<p>especially if you have insulin</p>
<p>resistance or you&rsquo;re pre-diabetic or</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re diabetic</p>
<p>and you eat this huge steak in the</p>
<p>evening you&rsquo;ll wake up your blood sugar</p>
<p>will be higher um even</p>
<p>significantly higher</p>
<p>and so you&rsquo;re wondering wait a second i</p>
<p>had no carbs well it&rsquo;s because the</p>
<p>protein</p>
<p>um a much better uh thing to look at in</p>
<p>relationship to</p>
<p>making sure that you&rsquo;re doing it correct</p>
<p>is the insulin index let&rsquo;s see if i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even have my book here but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an insulin index in my book</p>
<p>that measures</p>
<p>all the things that</p>
<p>react to insulin not just a spike of</p>
<p>blood sugar with the glycemic index so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only two things that don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>trigger insulin fat and fiber</p>
<p>and both of those things can buffer</p>
<p>the other foods that you eat</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>if you just ate for example</p>
<p>low-fat protein like in egg whites right</p>
<p>that would be that would create a higher</p>
<p>insulin spike than if you had the whole</p>
<p>egg</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>the point is that</p>
<p>this is why</p>
<p>lean</p>
<p>you know lean or low fat this or that is</p>
<p>can create more of a problem with</p>
<p>insulin</p>
<p>knowing that you can then do better with</p>
<p>your keto because</p>
<p>you can have a moderate amount of</p>
<p>protein and you can</p>
<p>realize why your blood sugars are higher</p>
<p>i will release the video on that shortly</p>
<p>so you can get more information because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot more to know you know you</p>
<p>know one of my um fascinations is sort</p>
<p>of a quasi dessert it&rsquo;s blueberries with</p>
<p>heavy cream on it and it just looks so</p>
<p>guilty but i don&rsquo;t get twitchy after i</p>
<p>eat that i do not get uptight like i do</p>
<p>with sugar</p>
<p>steve um i don&rsquo;t know if you can get</p>
<p>this but</p>
<p>in my area you can actually get raw milk</p>
<p>okay you have to sign a contract</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>sign over your firstborn but what</p>
<p>happens is that</p>
<p>they ship you this raw cream which we</p>
<p>get right</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s nothing better i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing raw cream with uh</p>
<p>blueberries but that is quite a dessert</p>
<p>and i i mainly with nuts and things but</p>
<p>uh i agree with you 100 it&rsquo;s uh it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>quite good</p>
<p>and uh you&rsquo;re making me hungry steve i</p>
<p>know kind of your cake and eat it too</p>
<p>when you when you look at keto and low</p>
<p>carb stuff you can have fun</p>
<p>all right let&rsquo;s see uh deangelo is</p>
<p>gallbladder removal by surgery necessary</p>
<p>of course i can&rsquo;t give you the medical</p>
<p>advice i don&rsquo;t know your situation but i</p>
<p>can tell you that the gallbladder is not</p>
<p>an extra gland that&rsquo;s not needed the</p>
<p>gallbladder does have a purpose</p>
<p>and it stores and it concentrates bile</p>
<p>by a factor of at least seven times so</p>
<p>why do we need concentrated bile because</p>
<p>when we eat that bile is</p>
<p>released into the small intestine</p>
<p>and it helps break down</p>
<p>all of our fatty foods so that we can</p>
<p>extract</p>
<p>vitamin a d e k omega 3 fatty acids all</p>
<p>these key fats</p>
<p>without that concentration you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to absorb nearly the amount of</p>
<p>fat</p>
<p>fat soluble nutrients so</p>
<p>the gallbladder is</p>
<p>necessary and when you remove it you end</p>
<p>up with a bile deficiency</p>
<p>and that creates a whole bunch of</p>
<p>problems too if if bile was not needed</p>
<p>then why do even our microbes make it</p>
<p>they actually help you make make a good</p>
<p>amount of your bile but so does the</p>
<p>liver</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not an extra thing and</p>
<p>try to keep it is as long as you can</p>
<p>keep that gallbladder as long as you can</p>
<p>all right very good andre from facebook</p>
<p>andre excuse me from facebook i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>learned so much from your videos i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>having no health issues to speak of i</p>
<p>just wanted to say thank you and god</p>
<p>bless there&rsquo;s a lot of that going on and</p>
<p>so thank you andrew for your positive</p>
<p>comments and dr berg&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>you know just incredible growth</p>
<p>i suspect is because of uh you know the</p>
<p>great results people are getting as dr</p>
<p>burke said before he doesn&rsquo;t say smash</p>
<p>that whatever button and</p>
<p>click on this and yet people do it like</p>
<p>crazy anyway because they are getting a</p>
<p>return on their investment of time and i</p>
<p>sure am too</p>
<p>all of my blueberries in heavy cream</p>
<p>what fun all right let&rsquo;s see um loretta</p>
<p>from facebook is it true that stevia can</p>
<p>spike blood sugars in some people</p>
<p>um it could i think it could in some</p>
<p>people but not in the great majority of</p>
<p>people um</p>
<p>what you have to realize with stevia is</p>
<p>a lot of times it doesn&rsquo;t just come with</p>
<p>stevia</p>
<p>so many different</p>
<p>packages and products of stevia come</p>
<p>with maltodextrin</p>
<p>to when they make this powder</p>
<p>they have to use a spray a drying agent</p>
<p>and maltodextrin is the one of choice</p>
<p>because it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s uh it&rsquo;s just something they use</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s cheap and it&rsquo;s from corn starch so</p>
<p>here you are trying to do this</p>
<p>great low carb and then end up you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>consuming all this maltodextrin which by</p>
<p>the way they also use it a lot of</p>
<p>supplements</p>
<p>especially in electrolyte powders</p>
<p>and this is</p>
<p>one reason why</p>
<p>some of the copycats that</p>
<p>are able to charge like</p>
<p>very small uh fees for the electrolytes</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting it from china they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting their powders from china and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s loaded with maltodextrin and so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you have to actually</p>
<p>pay more of the raw ingredients to get</p>
<p>it without the maltodextrin and so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we do</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;d rather</p>
<p>deliver a quality product without the</p>
<p>hidden sugar and</p>
<p>then something that has something hidden</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>had to do have it go off on a little</p>
<p>rant there steve but um</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s a problem a much appreciated</p>
<p>one i&rsquo;m sure here&rsquo;s a question our next</p>
<p>one number three</p>
<p>all right</p>
<p>number three which um</p>
<p>factor of exercise triggers</p>
<p>growth muscle growth more than any other</p>
<p>factor</p>
<p>dig into that audience and let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go back to our green room and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got a</p>
<p>adorable uh uh daughter mother team</p>
<p>coming up here now we can only see uh</p>
<p>tokoa but her mom because of our little</p>
<p>box her mom is right next to it so mom</p>
<p>maybe you can lean in sometimes but</p>
<p>takoya go ahead with your question about</p>
<p>your mom</p>
<p>hi dr bird</p>
<p>hi</p>
<p>so my mother has</p>
<p>had type 2 diabetes for a number of</p>
<p>years but it started</p>
<p>she was in a car accident</p>
<p>and part of her pancreas was removed</p>
<p>so over the years she&rsquo;s been controlling</p>
<p>her um blood sugar you know through her</p>
<p>diet and her</p>
<p>eating habits uh she small meals uh</p>
<p>usually starts later in the day about</p>
<p>maybe 10 or 11</p>
<p>a.m</p>
<p>um but she&rsquo;s lost a lot of weight and</p>
<p>just looking to either maintain or pick</p>
<p>up a little more weight but not continue</p>
<p>to lose weight</p>
<p>got it and is she type 1 or type 2</p>
<p>diabetic</p>
<p>type 2</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>is she doing actual keto as well with</p>
<p>like with intermittent fasting two meals</p>
<p>or is she kind of having multiple meals</p>
<p>for the day</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>most of the times it ends up about two</p>
<p>meals a day but sometimes it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>two or more</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>got it so here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s a couple little</p>
<p>tips if you&rsquo;re a diabetic and she&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>missing part of the pancreas</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the good news is that your body</p>
<p>will compensate and um</p>
<p>i think she can still do fine but</p>
<p>one really important product that might</p>
<p>benefit her it&rsquo;s from a company i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>affiliated with called standard process</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called pancreatrophene pmg</p>
<p>pancreatotrophin pmg</p>
<p>i would if i were her just take one of</p>
<p>those before bed</p>
<p>for like three months because that could</p>
<p>be</p>
<p>something that could um just support</p>
<p>that pancreas</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>the other than that um</p>
<p>i would get a bit</p>
<p>stricter on the um just the two meals a</p>
<p>day but increase the calories if</p>
<p>possible and make sure the quality of</p>
<p>food is there and i would start to</p>
<p>introduce</p>
<p>a very specific type of exercise</p>
<p>which i&rsquo;m going to be discussing in the</p>
<p>next section when we answer this</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>when people</p>
<p>age they kind of lose muscle so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like a very important factor to maintain</p>
<p>muscle and or else they start getting</p>
<p>atrophy and uh so people think of weight</p>
<p>loss of being just like oh i&rsquo;m losing</p>
<p>too much fat well you&rsquo;re losing muscle</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s we need to work on i mean</p>
<p>do we want to gain more weight with fat</p>
<p>no we want to gain more weight with</p>
<p>muscle so the muscle uh is going to be</p>
<p>stimulated with exercise but a very</p>
<p>specific type of exercise</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to kind of like</p>
<p>watch my new video release on that</p>
<p>because i want you to get the full</p>
<p>understanding</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk a little bit about it later</p>
<p>but i would include more calories</p>
<p>two meals only</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>that product pancreatrophen pmg</p>
<p>and add the exercise not frequent</p>
<p>but a good workout maybe once a week i</p>
<p>would recommend that to maintain the</p>
<p>weight</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>thank you ladies good luck and uh please</p>
<p>get back in touch with us with the great</p>
<p>results that you get after the fact it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great to see mom and daughter together</p>
<p>there let&rsquo;s see we&rsquo;ve already got answer</p>
<p>for quiz question number three let me</p>
<p>bring that up</p>
<p>i should have three hands to do this but</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>and before you answer that you know i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna be doing a video on a type one</p>
<p>diabetes i&rsquo;ll do an interview with uh</p>
<p>a person i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>back and forth with through the email</p>
<p>line and it&rsquo;s fascinating fascinating uh</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening with him because he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on</p>
<p>um he&rsquo;s doing hardcore keto with</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and the</p>
<p>amount of insulin he needs i mean i</p>
<p>think about this he has virtually</p>
<p>no insulin left</p>
<p>but the amount of insulin he needs is so</p>
<p>small right now i mean it would just</p>
<p>like defy</p>
<p>nature it&rsquo;s just like well you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>live on that low amount of insulin but</p>
<p>he is because if he has any more his</p>
<p>blood sugars go too low</p>
<p>so i think</p>
<p>the keto plan and intermittent fasting</p>
<p>for a type 1 diabetic</p>
<p>just as much as a type 2 is</p>
<p>going to be a lifesaver</p>
<p>because the more insulin you take the</p>
<p>more medication</p>
<p>the higher the risk of getting all sorts</p>
<p>of complications and side effects</p>
<p>so go ahead steve give me the the answer</p>
<p>to that all right so which factor of</p>
<p>exercise triggers muscle growth more</p>
<p>than any other</p>
<p>and 75 percent of our respondents say</p>
<p>resistance or weight training will</p>
<p>develop the most muscle 20 say high</p>
<p>intensity reps and 5 see using your own</p>
<p>body weight like walking running or</p>
<p>isometrics</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>so the answer is intensity intensity um</p>
<p>and what i mean by intensity is um</p>
<p>is uh effort</p>
<p>a maximum effort to the point where um</p>
<p>the muscles are exhausted</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not just fatigued they can&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>anymore like um of course</p>
<p>not everyone could just jump right into</p>
<p>that you have to kind of build up to it</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re interested in</p>
<p>strengthening your muscle growing muscle</p>
<p>you want to focus on your intensity and</p>
<p>really working doing a workout weight</p>
<p>training</p>
<p>you can achieve it probably better than</p>
<p>other things because you can</p>
<p>do types of weights to the point where</p>
<p>you just can&rsquo;t go anymore there&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>no more you&rsquo;ve completely exhausted that</p>
<p>muscle and if let&rsquo;s say you want to do</p>
<p>enough</p>
<p>enough workout to be able to go up to at</p>
<p>least</p>
<p>six reps but no longer than nine reps</p>
<p>until you get like there&rsquo;s no more</p>
<p>more energy to do even one more even if</p>
<p>someone put a gun to your head that</p>
<p>means you hit that maximum effort and</p>
<p>that intensity that you need to create</p>
<p>the stimulus necessary to cause your</p>
<p>body to adapt and recover but here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>secret of the universe steve are you</p>
<p>ready for this i</p>
<p>am you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t make the mistake that i made</p>
<p>exercising over soreness exercising</p>
<p>prematurely not letting your body fully</p>
<p>a hundred percent recover before you do</p>
<p>that again i&rsquo;m talking about the type of</p>
<p>exercise that&rsquo;s more intense so it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>principle that&rsquo;s very very important but</p>
<p>neglected so many people are going to</p>
<p>the gym three times a week and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not like paying attention to</p>
<p>their recovery</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re exercising when they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really even feel like it</p>
<p>the good the best thing to do is to wait</p>
<p>for your body to fully recover so you</p>
<p>feel good energy no more soreness then</p>
<p>do it again and it might take</p>
<p>one to two weeks that would be way way</p>
<p>better than</p>
<p>to try to force this</p>
<p>three times a week mentality now on the</p>
<p>other days you can do</p>
<p>light stuff you can do cardiovascular</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a problem but anything</p>
<p>involving intensity even high intensity</p>
<p>interval training</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going high you want to do that</p>
<p>less frequent and more intense</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>short duration</p>
<p>i will be releasing two videos on it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really simple very important and uh</p>
<p>um i want you to give you i want you to</p>
<p>think with the data so you can actually</p>
<p>grow your muscles back</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>based on your level of recovery which</p>
<p>you have age you have</p>
<p>other factors like your joints can they</p>
<p>handle that intensity there&rsquo;s a lot to</p>
<p>it but</p>
<p>very important</p>
<p>factor with exercise wow interesting</p>
<p>okay speaking of intense</p>
<p>rose from huntsville alabama says that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s intensely hot down there but she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>surviving and she has a question for you</p>
<p>dr berg go ahead rose</p>
<p>well um i i started following you my</p>
<p>husband and i started following you like</p>
<p>three and a half years ago um he&rsquo;s cuban</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m puerto rican so we love our rice and</p>
<p>beans so we gave all that up just for</p>
<p>you followed your ways my husband lost</p>
<p>110 pounds in 11 months</p>
<p>i lost</p>
<p>40 and then i kind of been stuck but i</p>
<p>have other uh issues i have sjogren&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fibro um nash and lipedema helps um</p>
<p>makes it the lip edema i have it makes</p>
<p>it hard for me to lose weight and i do</p>
<p>not have a gallbladder i&rsquo;ve been i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing what you said the tucker</p>
<p>the milk thistle the nac the tocotrinols</p>
<p>i get a mre</p>
<p>once a year it&rsquo;s a magnetic renaissance</p>
<p>elastography</p>
<p>and thanks to you my liver has improved</p>
<p>because everybody in my dad&rsquo;s side of</p>
<p>the family has died from uh liver camps</p>
<p>cancer so they monitor me</p>
<p>and so my one question to you</p>
<p>is um</p>
<p>i was thinking about getting getting</p>
<p>glutathione injections</p>
<p>if you thought that would benefit me in</p>
<p>any way</p>
<p>my stiffness has improved 50 percent</p>
<p>my fibroids have improved 50 but my</p>
<p>fatty liver</p>
<p>is still</p>
<p>uh you know</p>
<p>fatty and then i love you and your wife</p>
<p>and uh you mentioned that you were going</p>
<p>to do a homesteading channel i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>find that did you start that or</p>
<p>um i did not yeah i&rsquo;m still working that</p>
<p>out it&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s taking a bit longer but that&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>the agenda too</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>okay so um</p>
<p>ion if you think i should take it how</p>
<p>much</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>i i&rsquo;m not a fan of the injections of</p>
<p>glutathione because it&rsquo;s a one-shot deal</p>
<p>then you have to keep doing it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s giving you one of a powerful</p>
<p>antioxidant</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>how can we get your body to make more</p>
<p>glutathione that is a bigger question</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know like for example i think from</p>
<p>you you have an autoimmune disease you</p>
<p>have a fatty liver</p>
<p>you have lipoedema there&rsquo;s a lot going</p>
<p>on so and you&rsquo;ve done really good so far</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i like</p>
<p>i like what you said like let&rsquo;s focus on</p>
<p>the liver because that fatty liver is</p>
<p>gonna once the liver is better</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna do better overall so i</p>
<p>think</p>
<p>this is what i would do if i were you</p>
<p>every two weeks i would do a 48 hour</p>
<p>fast</p>
<p>and and then also i would do on the</p>
<p>regular days i would do one meal a day</p>
<p>and only have water and supplements</p>
<p>between there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to start to force your body</p>
<p>to dump a lot of this fat on your liver</p>
<p>the other key nutrient for pulling fat</p>
<p>off the liver other than the one you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking like the tuck cut is the um</p>
<p>is choline</p>
<p>choline choline is</p>
<p>very powerful to pull the liver off pull</p>
<p>the fat out of the liver</p>
<p>what i think i would also do is find a</p>
<p>functional medic functional nutritional</p>
<p>doc that can</p>
<p>look at your dna there&rsquo;s dna tests now</p>
<p>and just see where your weaknesses are</p>
<p>genetically to see if there&rsquo;s a some</p>
<p>type of um</p>
<p>mutation for</p>
<p>something it could be i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>vitamin d it could be a problem with</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called methylation</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know but</p>
<p>i have to stay</p>
<p>away from that i do have a methylation</p>
<p>problem</p>
<p>vitamin d3 i do have to take vitamin d3</p>
<p>because if i don&rsquo;t i&rsquo;m um</p>
<p>low and that&rsquo;s another thing you help me</p>
<p>on on those high doses i don&rsquo;t get my</p>
<p>asthma</p>
<p>wheezing or anything like that when that</p>
<p>happens i take high doses it&rsquo;s gone</p>
<p>within a day or two so you&rsquo;re awesome so</p>
<p>i think i think there&rsquo;s uh yeah there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely some weaknesses that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing the right thing so uh so in the</p>
<p>case if you have a methylation problem</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to need more of the correct</p>
<p>type of b12</p>
<p>b6</p>
<p>and folate you know there&rsquo;s products</p>
<p>that you can get on that but i would add</p>
<p>the choline in there as well and</p>
<p>and then just give it more time</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re taking the vitamin d</p>
<p>but the the key thing that&rsquo;s missing is</p>
<p>the periodic prolonged fasting</p>
<p>to give you a new immune system and to</p>
<p>drop all the inflammation down and to</p>
<p>also force your body to dump morph out</p>
<p>the liver so i think that would be the</p>
<p>best tip i can give you today</p>
<p>okay i&rsquo;m doing oh man so just continue</p>
<p>on omad and then do the 40 hour every</p>
<p>two weeks</p>
<p>yes yes</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it well terrific rose thank you</p>
<p>so much we&rsquo;re gonna move along here to</p>
<p>uh one of our next quiz questions and</p>
<p>doc here it is it&rsquo;s a true false sir</p>
<p>okay true or false the only</p>
<p>anti-depression factor being</p>
<p>in the sun is getting</p>
<p>vitamin d i&rsquo;m going to rephrase that</p>
<p>because it</p>
<p>looks like someone rephrase it so the</p>
<p>only um there&rsquo;s when you get sun</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know you get vitamin d right</p>
<p>so the question is um</p>
<p>that usually helps you with depression</p>
<p>but is there any other factor in the sun</p>
<p>that is anti-depression and now we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>now i&rsquo;m altering the question because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a true or false question so</p>
<p>i hope you got the concept see if you</p>
<p>can answer that question</p>
<p>and the question is is there anything</p>
<p>else in sun that can help you with</p>
<p>depression beyond vitamin d</p>
<p>and once again these true false</p>
<p>questions are fabulous because you have</p>
<p>a 50 chance of being smart and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not bad odds</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s see why don&rsquo;t we move on here</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s uh see jackie from youtube can</p>
<p>gluconeogenesis alone raise my a1c</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s a really good question and</p>
<p>i think it can but not by a significant</p>
<p>amount</p>
<p>not by a significant amount</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s just so much unknown about</p>
<p>that specific topic</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve looked at it before and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i couldn&rsquo;t find</p>
<p>any research on that</p>
<p>on answering that definitively i so</p>
<p>my answer is i think so by some degree</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t know for a fact</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>if it does raise it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like here you are you&rsquo;re doing keto</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going low carb but then your</p>
<p>a1c is going higher like what&rsquo;s up with</p>
<p>that uh that does happen but um</p>
<p>over time your insulin resistance will</p>
<p>improve if you keep doing it to the</p>
<p>point where you&rsquo;ll have less</p>
<p>liver producing new sugar okay so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to happen but the reason why</p>
<p>people wake up</p>
<p>with all this in high blood sugar and</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t eat anything today before</p>
<p>sugar-wise it&rsquo;s because their liver is</p>
<p>making</p>
<p>new sugar out of fat ketones</p>
<p>and protein</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s just because you&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>insulin resistance for too long and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to take a while for your body to</p>
<p>adjust</p>
<p>okay back to the green room we&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>kadeem from way up north in maine kadem</p>
<p>you are on with dr byrd</p>
<p>um hi dr barger this question is</p>
<p>actually from my wife um</p>
<p>she is actually listening to us through</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>youtube channel right now</p>
<p>um so it&rsquo;s started in her early 20s uh</p>
<p>she had a very bad</p>
<p>pain in her lower back</p>
<p>and all the mris ct scans mri did not</p>
<p>show any physical damage and then</p>
<p>because of the pain she had lack of</p>
<p>sleep uh she sometimes don&rsquo;t sleep for</p>
<p>uh two or three days uh because of the</p>
<p>lack sleep of sleep that led to</p>
<p>getting epilepsy and seizures</p>
<p>in her early 30s so they they put her on</p>
<p>tigrito</p>
<p>for about four years and then they moved</p>
<p>to uh</p>
<p>lyrica</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s been taking larika since then</p>
<p>till last year they finally found out</p>
<p>the shipping diagnosis with uh</p>
<p>endolamism and um</p>
<p>endometriosis sorry</p>
<p>and uh</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>yes and um she did the surgery last year</p>
<p>to remove them and it came back this</p>
<p>year and uh</p>
<p>so um and they need to do another</p>
<p>surgery</p>
<p>uh anyway um</p>
<p>so i just convinced her to uh</p>
<p>get into a keto healthy diet and uh</p>
<p>she started doing that this is her</p>
<p>fourth week right now and uh but the</p>
<p>side effect for the keto i don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a conflict with her medicine or</p>
<p>something</p>
<p>but she&rsquo;s getting like a 24 7 headache</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>she like the headache is very very</p>
<p>strong</p>
<p>and um she&rsquo;s getting a brain fog and</p>
<p>fatigue so</p>
<p>my question is what&rsquo;s the best remedy</p>
<p>for that and</p>
<p>yeah yeah so because when you do keto</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supposed to feel good right um</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s going on with that so there</p>
<p>must be some type of uh complication</p>
<p>going on with the medication</p>
<p>a couple things i would mention about</p>
<p>her</p>
<p>uh make sure to event to prevent</p>
<p>these</p>
<p>side effects from ketos to take more sea</p>
<p>salt</p>
<p>sea salt with the diet make sure she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>taking electrolytes make sure she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>taking the b vitamins because the lack</p>
<p>of sodium alone can create the headaches</p>
<p>and migraines especially</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>so we need this uh</p>
<p>sodium we also need enough potassium to</p>
<p>prevent headaches i think that is going</p>
<p>to create a big change for her um</p>
<p>you mentioned a lot with her history</p>
<p>endometriosis yeah which tells me that</p>
<p>she should have been on keto a long time</p>
<p>ago because</p>
<p>a lot of those carbs including even</p>
<p>dairy can stir up hormonal factors that</p>
<p>can create like tumors in the uterus</p>
<p>you also mentioned</p>
<p>the seizures which guess what keto is</p>
<p>the best</p>
<p>thing for</p>
<p>seizures and so the key is to have</p>
<p>a lot of fat</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>moderate protein make sure it&rsquo;s like on</p>
<p>the low side protein and very low carb</p>
<p>and make sure it&rsquo;s quality</p>
<p>and i think she will</p>
<p>she will come out of this quite nicely</p>
<p>and just give it a little bit more time</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>i think um</p>
<p>because she has a lot of issues i would</p>
<p>come back maybe in a couple weeks</p>
<p>and let us kind of review where she&rsquo;s at</p>
<p>but she needs to be on</p>
<p>the healthy version of keto</p>
<p>i would have i would also go through my</p>
<p>book to make sure you&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>correctly because there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>details and</p>
<p>she might need some tweaking</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>based on her her weaknesses</p>
<p>kadeem thank you so much and please do</p>
<p>get back with us we got to move along</p>
<p>here a little bit but that was a</p>
<p>fascinating question we all wish your</p>
<p>wife uh well and look forward to hearing</p>
<p>the great results in the future okay doc</p>
<p>our</p>
<p>true falser number four the only</p>
<p>anti-depression factor being in the sun</p>
<p>is getting vitamin d or however you</p>
<p>would phrase that and 50 50 this time 50</p>
<p>say</p>
<p>that it is and 50 say it ain&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s not all just about vitamin</p>
<p>d with depression but vitamin e can help</p>
<p>depression um that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>even people use what&rsquo;s called bright</p>
<p>light therapy during the winter to pull</p>
<p>them out of depression and it works like</p>
<p>crazy good for that because um you know</p>
<p>something about being in the dark</p>
<p>that makes you depressed</p>
<p>so um being out in the sun especially um</p>
<p>the actual sun</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain things that uh you will</p>
<p>stimulate number one is serotonin</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>excuse me um</p>
<p>serotonin</p>
<p>again they don&rsquo;t know exactly what</p>
<p>serotonin does but it does affect the</p>
<p>mood in certain ways</p>
<p>and so being out in the nice sunshine</p>
<p>can give you more serotonin and</p>
<p>you also have the benefit of</p>
<p>infrared</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a type of energy from the sun so</p>
<p>you have a huge different spectrum of</p>
<p>different wavelengths coming from the</p>
<p>sun and infrared is one of them in fact</p>
<p>54 of the sun is infrared infrared is a</p>
<p>great therapy for many things</p>
<p>including back pain from the last person</p>
<p>that we just talked about like she could</p>
<p>do infrared</p>
<p>and um but the point is that</p>
<p>when you expose yourself to infrared you</p>
<p>are generating a lot of melatonin that</p>
<p>is uh</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of outside the pineal gland</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a good antioxidant it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good protective</p>
<p>against all sorts of things</p>
<p>so i hope i answered that question and</p>
<p>i want to just shift gears because i</p>
<p>forgot to mention one thing for our last</p>
<p>caller who has the lower back pain</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s really good is that she has no</p>
<p>nothing on x-ray uh to show that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a disc problem or anything like that</p>
<p>so the best thing to do is to get some</p>
<p>type of</p>
<p>low back support</p>
<p>you know you can even go to a store and</p>
<p>get these little uh foam things from</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>you know the dollar store and cut them</p>
<p>and use these as little back supports i</p>
<p>have them in all all over the house and</p>
<p>you sit down you keep that low back</p>
<p>curve going forward because sitting and</p>
<p>driving just a killer for the lower back</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>that will</p>
<p>keep your back in a curved position and</p>
<p>reduce sciatica nerve pain and lower</p>
<p>back pain</p>
<p>because so many people sit way too long</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re wondering why does my back</p>
<p>hurt because you lost a curve</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s time to put that curve back all</p>
<p>right kadeem uh get some of that from</p>
<p>the dollar store and fix your wife up</p>
<p>and waiting very patiently is marcela</p>
<p>she was taking her daughter to uh school</p>
<p>and now she&rsquo;s all set in her house so</p>
<p>thanks for hanging in there with us</p>
<p>marcella you&rsquo;re on with dr burr</p>
<p>oh unmute yourself dear</p>
<p>there we go good morning</p>
<p>so um my question to you is um so i</p>
<p>belong to the navajo tribe and um type</p>
<p>two diabetes is like a major situation</p>
<p>with um a number of tribes and so i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been doing um omad for at least</p>
<p>maybe four four months but i i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>noticing you know the dramatic weight</p>
<p>loss or anything um</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m also confused in regards to like</p>
<p>my body type i seem to fall into</p>
<p>possibly the three categories and um i i</p>
<p>just need some you know um</p>
<p>i guess i just need some assistance in</p>
<p>regards to</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s my real body type</p>
<p>what type of supplements should i take</p>
<p>and also um</p>
<p>what would be the best exercise for me</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;m currently doing a lot of</p>
<p>hiking</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>do i need to switch that up a little too</p>
<p>okay so i&rsquo;m going to try to answer this</p>
<p>pretty quick</p>
<p>do you do one meal a day or two meals a</p>
<p>day</p>
<p>one</p>
<p>okay and</p>
<p>are you taking any medication</p>
<p>no</p>
<p>okay and did you say you you were a</p>
<p>diabetic</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>gestational diabetes so when i was told</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a precursor for type 2 type 2.</p>
<p>i kind of started switching the way i</p>
<p>you know my eating habits but</p>
<p>um i am</p>
<p>you know i can get type 2 diabetes and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m trying to avoid that</p>
<p>do you do you ever check your blood</p>
<p>sugars or ketones and if you do</p>
<p>um is there any problem with your blood</p>
<p>sugars and also like do you have you</p>
<p>ever checked your ketones</p>
<p>um i i&rsquo;ve checked my ketones and they</p>
<p>seem to be in check</p>
<p>um generally after i eat</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not in ketosis but the following</p>
<p>morning i generally am but it just</p>
<p>varies um you know a lot of times i</p>
<p>really watch what i eat and i&rsquo;m thinking</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like in ketosis and i check and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s kind of frustrating</p>
<p>so do you do did you have any benefits</p>
<p>so far from ketosis for example like</p>
<p>your appetite is gone or you have a</p>
<p>little more energy anything like that</p>
<p>no</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still hungry</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>okay so then then it tells me that uh</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something going on with the</p>
<p>actual</p>
<p>meal that you&rsquo;re eating there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something that needs to be evaluated and</p>
<p>i the the good news is that um i&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>a webinar in one to two weeks but i want</p>
<p>you to pop on so we can get a full</p>
<p>detailed thing on what you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing keto</p>
<p>and of course i need to know all the</p>
<p>details of what you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>you should be</p>
<p>you should lose your appetite and you</p>
<p>should be in ketosis so apparently</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not now the fact that you had</p>
<p>gestational diabetes tells me that you</p>
<p>probably have very severe insulin</p>
<p>resistance which is probably hanging you</p>
<p>up and taking causing</p>
<p>it to take longer</p>
<p>so a couple things you can do right now</p>
<p>electrolyte</p>
<p>powder is going to be really key with a</p>
<p>lot of potassium</p>
<p>that potassium can speed things up</p>
<p>tremendously and then the other thing</p>
<p>especially for insulin resistance</p>
<p>and the other thing the two things is</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i would if i were you</p>
<p>if you have the discipline</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>maybe a few times a week go do like a</p>
<p>48-hour fast</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to happen is you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to force your body to adapt to fat</p>
<p>burning and your body has no choice but</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>extract that fat and that will speed up</p>
<p>this healing of insulin resistance</p>
<p>the last thing i would do i&rsquo;d probably</p>
<p>do this around your eating window is do</p>
<p>a workout maybe once a week a really</p>
<p>hardcore</p>
<p>intense workout to the point where you</p>
<p>are definitely sore not just for one day</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re sore</p>
<p>for two or three or four or</p>
<p>the whole week so that would be the</p>
<p>level of intensity because that&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to create um</p>
<p>a huge stimulus for not just</p>
<p>you know to support your muscles but</p>
<p>also for insulin resistance i like the</p>
<p>fact that you&rsquo;re doing walking each day</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s good but we need to add that</p>
<p>anaerobic or</p>
<p>that intense workout somewhere during</p>
<p>the week to speed things up and then</p>
<p>stay tuned for uh if you&rsquo;re at my email</p>
<p>list we&rsquo;ll tell you when we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have this webinar and then you can</p>
<p>we can go into more depth of what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating and to really figure out this be</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re trying to get information</p>
<p>so we can</p>
<p>coach people better and evaluate your</p>
<p>meal</p>
<p>and you would send us pictures of your</p>
<p>meals so we can go</p>
<p>oh</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s exactly what we need to change</p>
<p>because working out the</p>
<p>your meals is not as easy as you think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just not like a quick thing so</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re putting in a program that we can</p>
<p>do more evaluations on your eating so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming up real quick</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s great listen thanks so much</p>

<p>show next week and the following week</p>
<p>but then um</p>
<p>after that</p>
<p>i won&rsquo;t be doing it for probably about</p>
<p>three</p>
<p>three weeks because i&rsquo;m going to be</p>
<p>doing a whole research thing</p>
<p>so just to give you a heads up</p>

<p>research i&rsquo;m going to do that i&rsquo;m going</p>
