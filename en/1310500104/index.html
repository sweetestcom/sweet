    <p>The following is a conversation with David Patterson, touring award winner and professor</p>
<p>of computer science at Berkeley. He&rsquo;s known for pioneering contributions to RISC processor</p>
<p>architecture used by 99% of new chips today and for co creating RAID storage. The impact that</p>
<p>these two lines of research and development have had in our world is immeasurable. He&rsquo;s also one of</p>
<p>the great educators of computer science in the world. His book with John Hennessy is how I first</p>
<p>learned about and was humbled by the inner workings of machines at the lowest level.</p>
<p>This episode is supported by the Jordan Harbinger Show.</p>
<p>Go to Jordan Harbinger.com slash Lex. It&rsquo;s how he knows I sent you on that page. There&rsquo;s links</p>
<p>to subscribe to it on Apple podcast, Spotify, and everywhere else. I&rsquo;ve been binging on this podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing. Jordan is a great human being. He gets the best out of his guests, dives deep,</p>
<p>calls them out when it&rsquo;s needed, and makes the whole thing fun to listen to. He&rsquo;s interviewed</p>
<p>Kobe Bryant, Mark Cuban, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Garry Kasparov, and many more. I recently listened</p>
<p>to his conversation with Frank Abagnale, author of Catch Me If You Can, and one of the world&rsquo;s</p>
<p>most famous con men. Perfect podcast length and topic for a recent long distance run that I did.</p>
<p>Again, go to Jordan Harbinger.com slash Lex to give him my love and to support this podcast.</p>

<p>This show is presented by Cash App, the greatest sponsor of this podcast ever, and the number one</p>
<p>finance app in the App Store. When you get it, use code LEX PODCAST. Cash App lets you send money</p>
<p>to friends, buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with as little as $1. Since Cash App allows</p>
<p>you to buy Bitcoin, let me mention that cryptocurrency in the context of the history</p>
<p>of money is fascinating. I recommend Ascent of Money as a great book on this history.</p>
<p>Also, the audiobook is amazing. Debits and credits on Ledger started around 30,000 years ago.</p>
<p>The US dollar created over 200 years ago, and the first decentralized cryptocurrency released just</p>
<p>over 10 years ago. So given that history, cryptocurrency is still very much in its early</p>
<p>days of development, but it&rsquo;s still aiming to and just might redefine the nature of money.</p>
<p>So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play, and use the code LEX PODCAST,</p>
<p>you get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST, an organization that is helping to</p>
<p>advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world. And now, here&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>conversation with David Patterson. Let&rsquo;s start with the big historical question. How have computers</p>
<p>changed in the past 50 years at both the fundamental architectural level and in general, in your eyes?</p>
<p>David Patterson Well, the biggest thing that happened was the invention of the microprocessor.</p>
<p>So computers that used to fill up several rooms could fit inside your cell phone. And not only</p>
<p>did they get smaller, they got a lot faster. So they&rsquo;re a million times faster than they were</p>
<p>50 years ago, and they&rsquo;re much cheaper, and they&rsquo;re ubiquitous. There&rsquo;s 7.8 billion people</p>
<p>on this planet. Probably half of them have cell phones right now, which is remarkable.</p>
<p>Soterios Johnson That&rsquo;s probably more microprocessors than there are people.</p>
<p>David Patterson Sure. I don&rsquo;t know what the ratio is,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s above one. Maybe it&rsquo;s 10 to 1 or some number like that.</p>
<p>Soterios Johnson What is a microprocessor?</p>
<p>David Patterson So a way to say what a microprocessor is,</p>
<p>is to tell you what&rsquo;s inside a computer. So a computer forever has classically had</p>
<p>five pieces. There&rsquo;s input and output, which kind of naturally, as you&rsquo;d expect, is input is like</p>
<p>speech or typing, and output is displays. There&rsquo;s a memory, and like the name sounds, it remembers</p>
<p>things. So it&rsquo;s integrated circuits whose job is you put information in, then when you ask for it,</p>
<p>it comes back out. That&rsquo;s memory. And the third part is the processor, where the microprocessor</p>
<p>comes from. And that has two pieces as well. And that is the control, which is kind of the brain</p>
<p>of the processor. And what&rsquo;s called the arithmetic unit, it&rsquo;s kind of the brawn of the computer. So</p>
<p>if you think of the, as a human body, the arithmetic unit, the thing that does the</p>
<p>number crunching is the body and the control is the brain. So those five pieces, input, output,</p>
<p>memory, arithmetic unit, and control are, have been in computers since the very dawn. And the</p>
<p>last two are considered the processor. So a microprocessor simply means a processor that</p>
<p>fits on a microchip. And that was invented about, you know, 40 years ago, was the first microprocessor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that you refer to the arithmetic unit as the, like you connected to the body and</p>
<p>the controllers of the brain. So I guess, I never thought of it that way. It&rsquo;s a nice way to think</p>
<p>of it because most of the actions the microprocessor does in terms of literally sort of computation,</p>
<p>but the microprocessor does computation. It processes information. And most of the thing it</p>
<p>does is basic arithmetic operations. What are the operations, by the way?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot like a calculator. So there are add instructions, subtract instructions,</p>
<p>multiply and divide. And kind of the brilliance of the invention of the computer or the processor</p>
<p>is that it performs very trivial operations, but it just performs billions of them per second.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;re capable of doing is writing software that can take these very trivial instructions</p>
<p>and have them create tasks that can do things better than human beings can do today.</p>
<p>Just looking back through your career, did you anticipate the kind of how good we would be able</p>
<p>to get at doing these small, basic operations? How many surprises along the way where you just</p>
<p>kind of sat back and said, wow, I didn&rsquo;t expect it to go this fast, this good?</p>
<p>MG Well, the fundamental driving force is what&rsquo;s called Moore&rsquo;s law, which was named after Gordon</p>
<p>Moore, who&rsquo;s a Berkeley alumnus. And he made this observation very early in what are called</p>
<p>semiconductors. And semiconductors are these ideas, you can build these very simple switches,</p>
<p>and you can put them on these microchips. And he made this observation over 50 years ago.</p>
<p>He looked at a few years and said, I think what&rsquo;s going to happen is the number of these little</p>
<p>switches called transistors is going to double every year for the next decade. And he said this</p>
<p>in 1965. And in 1975, he said, well, maybe it&rsquo;s going to double every two years. And that what</p>
<p>other people since named that Moore&rsquo;s law guided the industry. And when Gordon Moore made that</p>
<p>prediction, he wrote a paper back in, I think, in the 70s and said, not only did this going to happen,</p>
<p>he wrote, what would be the implications of that? And in this article from 1965,</p>
<p>he shows ideas like computers being in cars and computers being in something that you would buy</p>
<p>in the grocery store and stuff like that. So he kind of not only called his shot, he called the</p>
<p>implications of it. So if you were in the computing field, and if you believed Moore&rsquo;s prediction,</p>
<p>he kind of said what would be happening in the future. So it&rsquo;s not kind of, it&rsquo;s at one sense,</p>
<p>this is what was predicted. And you could imagine it was easy to believe that Moore&rsquo;s law was going</p>
<p>to continue. And so this would be the implications. On the other side, there are these kind of</p>
<p>shocking events in your life. Like I remember driving in Marin across the Bay in San Francisco</p>
<p>and seeing a bulletin board at a local civic center and it had a URL on it. And it was like,</p>
<p>for the people at the time, these first URLs and that&rsquo;s the, you know, www select stuff with the</p>
<p>HTTP. People thought it looked like alien writing, right? You&rsquo;d see these advertisements and</p>
<p>commercials or bulletin boards that had this alien writing on it. So for the lay people, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>what the hell is going on here? And for those people in the industry, it was, oh my God,</p>
<p>this stuff is getting so popular, it&rsquo;s actually leaking out of our nerdy world into the real</p>
<p>world. So that, I mean, there was events like that. I think another one was, I remember in the</p>
<p>early days of the personal computer, when we started seeing advertisements in magazines</p>
<p>for personal computers, like it&rsquo;s so popular that it&rsquo;s made the newspapers. So at one hand,</p>
<p>you know, Gordon Moore predicted it and you kind of expected it to happen, but when it really hit</p>
<p>and you saw it affecting society, it was shocking. So maybe taking a step back and looking both</p>
<p>the engineering and philosophical perspective, what do you see as the layers of abstraction</p>
<p>in the computer? Do you see a computer as a set of layers of abstractions?</p>
<p>Dr. Justin Marchegiani Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s one of the things that computer science</p>
<p>fundamentals is the, these things are really complicated in the way we cope with complicated</p>
<p>software and complicated hardware is these layers of abstraction. And that simply means that we,</p>
<p>you know, suspend disbelief and pretend that the only thing you know is that layer,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t know anything about the layer below it. And that&rsquo;s the way we can make very complicated</p>
<p>things. And probably it started with hardware that that&rsquo;s the way it was done, but it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>proven extremely useful. And, you know, I would say in a modern computer today, there might be</p>
<p>10 or 20 layers of abstraction, and they&rsquo;re all trying to kind of enforce this contract is all</p>
<p>you know is this interface. There&rsquo;s a set of commands that you can, are allowed to use,</p>
<p>and you stick to those commands, and we will faithfully execute that. And it&rsquo;s like peeling</p>
<p>the air layers of a London, of an onion, you get down, there&rsquo;s a new set of layers and so forth.</p>
<p>So for people who want to study computer science, the exciting part about it is you can</p>
<p>keep peeling those layers. You take your first course, and you might learn to program in Python,</p>
<p>and then you can take a follow on course, and you can get it down to a lower level language like C,</p>
<p>and you know, you can go and then you can, if you want to, you can start getting into the hardware</p>
<p>layers, and you keep getting down all the way to that transistor that I talked about that Gordon</p>
<p>Moore predicted. And you can understand all those layers all the way up to the highest level</p>
<p>application software. So it&rsquo;s a very kind of magnetic field. If you&rsquo;re interested, you can go</p>
<p>into any depth and keep going. In particular, what&rsquo;s happening right now, or it&rsquo;s happened</p>
<p>in software the last 20 years and recently in hardware, there&rsquo;s getting to be open source</p>
<p>versions of all of these things. So what open source means is what the engineer, the programmer</p>
<p>designs, it&rsquo;s not secret, the belonging to a company, it&rsquo;s out there on the worldwide web,</p>
<p>so you can see it. So you can look at, for lots of pieces of software that you use, you can see</p>
<p>exactly what the programmer does if you want to get involved. That used to stop at the hardware.</p>
<p>Recently, there&rsquo;s been an effort to make open source hardware and those interfaces open,</p>
<p>so you can see that. So instead of before you had to stop at the hardware, you can now start going</p>
<p>layer by layer below that and see what&rsquo;s inside there. So it&rsquo;s a remarkable time that for the</p>
<p>interested individual can really see in great depth what&rsquo;s really going on in the computers</p>
<p>that power everything that we see around us. Are you thinking also when you say open source at</p>
<p>the hardware level, is this going to the design architecture instruction set level or is it going</p>
<p>to literally the manufacturer of the actual hardware, of the actual chips, whether that&rsquo;s ASIC</p>
<p>specialized to a particular domain or the general? Yeah, so let&rsquo;s talk about that a little bit.</p>
<p>So when you get down to the bottom layer of software, the way software talks to hardware</p>
<p>is in a vocabulary. And what we call that vocabulary, we call that, the words of that</p>
<p>vocabulary are called instructions. And the technical term for the vocabulary is instruction</p>
<p>set. So those instructions are like we talked about earlier, that can be instructions like</p>
<p>add, subtract and multiply, divide. There&rsquo;s instructions to put data into memory, which</p>
<p>is called a store instruction and to get data back, which is called the load instructions.</p>
<p>And those simple instructions go back to the very dawn of computing in 1950, the commercial</p>
<p>computer had these instructions. So that&rsquo;s the instruction set that we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>So up until, I&rsquo;d say 10 years ago, these instruction sets were all proprietary. So</p>
<p>a very popular one is owned by Intel, the one that&rsquo;s in the cloud and in all the PCs in the</p>
<p>world. Intel owns that instruction set. It&rsquo;s referred to as the x86. There&rsquo;ve been a sequence</p>
<p>of ones that the first number was called 8086. And since then, there&rsquo;s been a lot of numbers,</p>
<p>but they all end in 86. So there&rsquo;s been that kind of family of instruction sets.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s proprietary.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s proprietary. The other one that&rsquo;s very popular is from ARM. That kind of powers all</p>
<p>the cell phones in the world, all the iPads in the world, and a lot of things that are so called</p>
<p>Internet of Things devices. ARM and that one is also proprietary. ARM will license it to people</p>
<p>for a fee, but they own that. So the new idea that got started at Berkeley kind of unintentionally</p>
<p>10 years ago is early in my career, we pioneered a way to do these vocabularies instruction sets</p>
<p>that was very controversial at the time. At the time in the 1980s, conventional wisdom was these</p>
<p>vocabularies instruction sets should have powerful instructions. So polysyllabic kind of words,</p>
<p>you can think of that. And so instead of just add, subtract, and multiply, they would have</p>
<p>polynomial, divide, or sort a list. And the hope was of those powerful vocabularies,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;d make it easier for software. So we thought that didn&rsquo;t make sense for microprocessors. There</p>
<p>was people at Berkeley and Stanford and IBM who argued the opposite. And what we called that was</p>
<p>a reduced instruction set computer. And the abbreviation was RISC. And typical for computer</p>
<p>people, we use the abbreviation start pronouncing it. So risk was the thing. So we said for</p>
<p>microprocessors, which with Gordon&rsquo;s Moore is changing really fast, we think it&rsquo;s better to have</p>
<p>a pretty simple set of instructions, reduced set of instructions. That that would be a better way</p>
<p>to build microprocessors since they&rsquo;re going to be changing so fast due to Moore&rsquo;s law. And then</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll just use standard software to cover the use, generate more of those simple instructions. And</p>
<p>one of the pieces of software that&rsquo;s in that software stack going between these layers of</p>
<p>abstractions is called a compiler. And it&rsquo;s basically translates, it&rsquo;s a translator between</p>
<p>levels. We said the translator will handle that. So the technical question was, well, since there</p>
<p>are these reduced instructions, you have to execute more of them. Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. But</p>
<p>maybe you could execute them faster. Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. They&rsquo;re simpler so they could go faster,</p>
<p>but you have to do more of them. So what&rsquo;s that trade off look like? And it ended up that we ended</p>
<p>up executing maybe 50% more instructions, maybe a third more instructions, but they ran four times</p>
<p>faster. So this risk, controversial risk ideas proved to be maybe factors of three or four</p>
<p>better. I love that this idea was controversial and almost kind of like rebellious. So that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in the context of what was more conventional is the complex instructional set computing. So</p>
<p>how would you pronounce that? CISC. CISC versus risk. Risk versus CISC. And believe it or not,</p>
<p>this sounds very, who cares about this? It was violently debated at several conferences. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like, what&rsquo;s the right way to go? And people thought risk was a deevolution. We&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>make software worse by making those instructions simpler. And there are fierce debates at several</p>
<p>conferences in the 1980s. And then later in the 80s, it kind of settled to these benefits.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not completely intuitive to me why risk has, for the most part, won.</p>
<p>Yeah. So why did that happen? Yeah. Yeah. And maybe I can sort of say a bunch of dumb things</p>
<p>that could lay the land for further commentary. So to me, this is kind of an interesting thing.</p>
<p>If you look at C++ versus C, with modern compilers, you really could write faster code</p>
<p>with C++. So relying on the compiler to reduce your complicated code into something simple and</p>
<p>fast. So to me, comparing risk, maybe this is a dumb question, but why is it that focusing the</p>
<p>definition of the design of the instruction set on very few simple instructions in the long run</p>
<p>provide faster execution versus coming up with, like you said, a ton of complicated instructions</p>
<p>that over time, you know, years, maybe decades, you come up with compilers that can reduce those</p>
<p>into simple instructions for you. Yeah. So let&rsquo;s try and split that into two pieces.</p>
<p>So if the compiler can do that for you, if the compiler can take, you know, a complicated program</p>
<p>and produce simpler instructions, then the programmer doesn&rsquo;t care, right? I don&rsquo;t care just</p>
<p>how fast is the computer I&rsquo;m using, how much does it cost? And so what happened kind of in the</p>
<p>software industry is right around before the 1980s, critical pieces of software were still written</p>
<p>not in languages like C or C++, they were written in what&rsquo;s called assembly language, where there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this kind of humans writing exactly at the instructions at the level that a computer can</p>
<p>understand. So they were writing add, subtract, multiply, you know, instructions. It&rsquo;s very tedious.</p>
<p>But the belief was to write this lowest level of software that people use, which are called operating</p>
<p>systems, they had to be written in assembly language because these high level languages were just too</p>
<p>inefficient. They were too slow, or the programs would be too big. So that changed with a famous</p>
<p>operating system called Unix, which is kind of the grandfather of all the operating systems today.</p>
<p>So Unix demonstrated that you could write something as complicated as an operating system in a</p>
<p>language like C. So once that was true, then that meant we could hide the instruction set from the</p>
<p>programmer. And so that meant then it didn&rsquo;t really matter. The programmer didn&rsquo;t have to write</p>
<p>lots of these simple instructions, that was up to the compiler. So that was part of our arguments</p>
<p>for risk is, if you were still writing assembly language, there&rsquo;s maybe a better case for CISC</p>
<p>instructions. But if the compiler can do that, it&rsquo;s going to be, you know, that&rsquo;s done once the</p>
<p>computer translates at once. And then every time you run the program, it runs at this potentially</p>
<p>simpler instructions. And so that was the debate, right? And people would acknowledge that the</p>
<p>simpler instructions could lead to a faster computer. You can think of monosyllabic instructions,</p>
<p>you could say them, you know, if you think of reading, you can probably read them faster or say</p>
<p>them faster than long instructions. The same thing, that analogy works pretty well for hardware.</p>
<p>And as long as you didn&rsquo;t have to read a lot more of those instructions, you could win. So that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of, that&rsquo;s the basic idea for risk. But it&rsquo;s interesting that in that discussion of Unix and C,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s only one step of levels of abstraction from the code that&rsquo;s really the closest to the</p>
<p>machine to the code that&rsquo;s written by human. It&rsquo;s, at least to me again, perhaps a dumb intuition,</p>
<p>but it feels like there might&rsquo;ve been more layers, sort of different kinds of humans stacked on top</p>
<p>of each other. So what&rsquo;s true and not true about what you said is several of the layers of software,</p>
<p>like, so the, if you, two layers would be, suppose we just talked about two layers,</p>
<p>that would be the operating system, like you get from Microsoft or from Apple, like iOS,</p>
<p>or the Windows operating system. And let&rsquo;s say applications that run on top of it, like Word</p>
<p>or Excel. So both the operating system could be written in C and the application could be written</p>
<p>in C. But you could construct those two layers and the applications absolutely do call upon the</p>
<p>operating system. And the change was that both of them could be written in higher level languages.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s one step of a translation, but you can still build many layers of abstraction</p>
<p>of software on top of that. And that&rsquo;s how things are done today. So still today,</p>
<p>many of the layers that you&rsquo;ll deal with, you may deal with debuggers, you may deal with linkers,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s libraries. Many of those today will be written in C++, say, even though that language is</p>
<p>pretty ancient. And even the Python interpreter is probably written in C or C++. So lots of</p>
<p>layers there are probably written in these, some old fashioned efficient languages that</p>
<p>still take one step to produce these instructions, produce RISC instructions, but they&rsquo;re composed,</p>
<p>each layer of software invokes one another through these interfaces. And you can get 10 layers of</p>
<p>software that way. So in general, the RISC was developed here at Berkeley? It was kind of the</p>
<p>three places that were these radicals that advocated for this against the rest of community</p>
<p>were IBM, Berkeley, and Stanford. You&rsquo;re one of these radicals. And how radical did you feel?</p>
<p>How confident did you feel? How doubtful were you that RISC might be the right approach? Because</p>
<p>it may, you can also intuit that is kind of taking a step back into simplicity, not forward into</p>
<p>simplicity. Yeah, no, it was easy to make, yeah, it was easy to make the argument against it. Well,</p>
<p>this was my colleague, John Hennessy at Stanford Nine. We were both assistant professors. And</p>
<p>for me, I just believed in the power of our ideas. I thought what we were saying made sense.</p>
<p>Moore&rsquo;s law is going to move fast. The other thing that I didn&rsquo;t mention is one of the surprises of</p>
<p>these complex instruction sets. You could certainly write these complex instructions</p>
<p>if the programmer is writing them themselves. It turned out to be kind of difficult for the</p>
<p>compiler to generate those complex instructions. Kind of ironically, you&rsquo;d have to find the right</p>
<p>circumstances that just exactly fit this complex instruction. It was actually easier for the</p>
<p>compiler to generate these simple instructions. So not only did these complex instructions make</p>
<p>the hardware more difficult to build, often the compiler wouldn&rsquo;t even use them. And so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s harder to build. The compiler doesn&rsquo;t use them that much. The simple instructions go better</p>
<p>with Moore&rsquo;s law. The number of transistors is doubling every two years. So we&rsquo;re going to have,</p>
<p>you want to reduce the time to design the microprocessor, that may be more important</p>
<p>than these number of instructions. So I think we believed that we were right, that this was</p>
<p>the best idea. Then the question became in these debates, well, yeah, that&rsquo;s a good technical idea,</p>
<p>but in the business world, this doesn&rsquo;t matter. There&rsquo;s other things that matter. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>arguing that if there&rsquo;s a standard with the railroad tracks and you&rsquo;ve come up with a better</p>
<p>width, but the whole world is covered in railroad tracks, so your ideas have no chance of success.</p>
<p>Right. Commercial success. It was technically right, but commercially it&rsquo;ll be insignificant.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s kind of sad that this world, the history of human civilization is full of good ideas that</p>
<p>lost because somebody else came along first with a worse idea. And it&rsquo;s good that in the</p>
<p>computing world, at least some of these have, well, you could, I mean, there&rsquo;s probably still</p>
<p>CISC people that say, yeah, there still are. And what happened was, what was interesting, Intel,</p>
<p>a bunch of the CISC companies with CISC instruction sets of vocabulary, they gave up,</p>
<p>but not Intel. What Intel did to its credit, because Intel&rsquo;s vocabulary was in the personal</p>
<p>computer. And so that was a very valuable vocabulary because the way we distribute software</p>
<p>is in those actual instructions. It&rsquo;s in the instructions of that instruction set. So</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get that source code, what the programmers wrote. You get, after it&rsquo;s been translated into</p>
<p>the lowest level, that&rsquo;s if you were to get a floppy disk or download software, it&rsquo;s in the</p>
<p>instructions of that instruction set. So the x86 instruction set was very valuable. So what Intel</p>
<p>did cleverly and amazingly is they had their chips in hardware do a translation step.</p>
<p>They would take these complex instructions and translate them into essentially in RISC instructions</p>
<p>in hardware on the fly, at gigahertz clock speeds. And then any good idea that RISC people had,</p>
<p>they could use, and they could still be compatible with this really valuable PC software base,</p>
<p>which also had very high volumes, 100 million personal computers per year. So the CISC architecture</p>
<p>in the business world was actually won in this PC era. So just going back to the</p>
<p>time of designing RISC, when you design an instruction set architecture, do you think</p>
<p>like a programmer? Do you think like a microprocessor engineer? Do you think like a</p>
<p>artist, a philosopher? Do you think in software and hardware? I mean, is it art? Is it science?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;d say, I think designing a good instruction set is an art. And I think you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>balance the simplicity and speed of execution with how well easy it will be for compilers</p>
<p>to use it. You&rsquo;re trying to create an instruction set that everything in there can be used by</p>
<p>compilers. There&rsquo;s not things that are missing that&rsquo;ll make it difficult for the program to run.</p>
<p>They run efficiently, but you want it to be easy to build as well. So I&rsquo;d say you&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>hardware, trying to find a hardware software compromise that&rsquo;ll work well. And it&rsquo;s a matter</p>
<p>of taste. It&rsquo;s kind of fun to build instruction sets. It&rsquo;s not that hard to build an instruction</p>
<p>set, but to build one that catches on and people use, you have to be fortunate to be</p>
<p>the right place in the right time or have a design that people really like. Are you using metrics?</p>
<p>So is it quantifiable? Because you kind of have to anticipate the kind of programs that people</p>
<p>write ahead of time. So can you use numbers? Can you use metrics? Can you quantify something ahead</p>
<p>of time? Or is this, again, that&rsquo;s the art part where you&rsquo;re kind of anticipating? No, it&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>change. Kind of what happened, I think from Hennessy&rsquo;s and my perspective in the 1980s,</p>
<p>what happened was going from kind of really, you know, taste and hunches to quantifiable. And in</p>
<p>fact, he and I wrote a textbook at the end of the 1980s called Computer Architecture, A Quantitative</p>
<p>Approach. I heard of that. And it&rsquo;s the thing, it had a pretty big impact in the field because we</p>
<p>went from textbooks that kind of listed, so here&rsquo;s what this computer does, and here&rsquo;s the pros and</p>
<p>cons, and here&rsquo;s what this computer does and pros and cons to something where there were formulas</p>
<p>and equations where you could measure things. So specifically for instruction sets, what we do</p>
<p>and some other fields do is we agree upon a set of programs, which we call benchmarks,</p>
<p>and a suite of programs, and then you develop both the hardware and the compiler and you get</p>
<p>numbers on how well your computer does given its instruction set and how well you implemented it in</p>
<p>your microprocessor and how good your compilers are. In computer architecture, you know, using</p>
<p>professor&rsquo;s terms, we grade on a curve rather than grade on an absolute scale. So when you say,</p>
<p>you know, these programs run this fast, well, that&rsquo;s kind of interesting, but how do you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s better? Well, you compare it to other computers at the same time. So the best way we</p>
<p>know how to turn it into a kind of more science and experimental and quantitative is to compare</p>
<p>yourself to other computers of the same era that have the same access to the same kind of technology</p>
<p>on commonly agreed benchmark programs.</p>
<p>So maybe to toss up two possible directions we can go. One is what are the different tradeoffs</p>
<p>in designing architectures? We&rsquo;ve been already talking about SISC and RISC, but maybe a little</p>
<p>bit more detail in terms of specific features that you were thinking about. And the other side is</p>
<p>what are the metrics that you&rsquo;re thinking about when looking at these tradeoffs?</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s talk about the metrics. So during these debates, we actually had kind of a hard</p>
<p>time explaining, convincing people the ideas, and partly we didn&rsquo;t have a formula to explain it.</p>
<p>And a few years into it, we hit upon a formula that helped explain what was going on. And</p>
<p>I think if we can do this, see how it works orally to do this. So if I can do a formula</p>
<p>orally, let&rsquo;s see. So fundamentally, the way you measure performance is how long does it take a</p>
<p>program to run? A program, if you have 10 programs, and typically these benchmarks were sweet because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d want to have 10 programs so they could represent lots of different applications. So for</p>
<p>these 10 programs, how long does it take to run? Well now, when you&rsquo;re trying to explain why it</p>
<p>took so long, you could factor how long it takes a program to run into three factors.</p>
<p>One of the first one is how many instructions did it take to execute? So that&rsquo;s the what we&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>talking about, you know, the instructions of Alchemy. How many did it take? All right. The</p>
<p>next question is how long did each instruction take to run on average? So you multiply the number</p>
<p>of instructions times how long it took to run, and that gets you time. Okay, so that&rsquo;s, but now let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>look at this metric of how long did it take the instruction to run. Well, it turns out,</p>
<p>the way we could build computers today is they all have a clock, and you&rsquo;ve seen this when you,</p>
<p>if you buy a microprocessor, it&rsquo;ll say 3.1 gigahertz or 2.5 gigahertz, and more gigahertz is</p>
<p>good. Well, what that is is the speed of the clock. So 2.5 gigahertz turns out to be 4 billionths of</p>
<p>instruction or 4 nanoseconds. So that&rsquo;s the clock cycle time. But there&rsquo;s another factor, which is</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the average number of clock cycles it takes per instruction? So it&rsquo;s number of instructions,</p>
<p>average number of clock cycles, and the clock cycle time. So in these risk sis debates, they</p>
<p>would concentrate on, but risk needs to take more instructions, and we&rsquo;d argue maybe the clock cycle</p>
<p>is faster, but what the real big difference was was the number of clock cycles per instruction.</p>
<p>Per instruction, that&rsquo;s fascinating. What about the mess of, the beautiful mess of parallelism in the</p>
<p>whole picture? Parallelism, which has to do with, say, how many instructions could execute in parallel</p>
<p>and things like that, you could think of that as affecting the clock cycles per instruction,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the average clock cycles per instruction. So when you&rsquo;re running a program,</p>
<p>if it took 100 billion instructions, and on average it took two clock cycles per instruction,</p>
<p>and they were four nanoseconds, you could multiply that out and see how long it took to run.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s all kinds of tricks to try and reduce the number of clock cycles per instruction.</p>
<p>But it turned out that the way they would do these complex instructions is they would actually</p>
<p>build what we would call an interpreter in a simpler, a very simple hardware interpreter.</p>
<p>But it turned out that for the sis constructions, if you had to use one of those interpreters,</p>
<p>it would be like 10 clock cycles per instruction, where the risk constructions could be two. So</p>
<p>there&rsquo;d be this factor of five advantage in clock cycles per instruction. We have to execute, say,</p>
<p>25 or 50 percent more instructions, so that&rsquo;s where the win would come. And then you could</p>
<p>make an argument whether the clock cycle times are the same or not. But pointing out that we</p>
<p>could divide the benchmark results time per program into three factors, and the biggest</p>
<p>difference between RISC and SIS was the clock cycles per, you execute a few more instructions,</p>
<p>but the clock cycles per instruction is much less. And that was what this debate, once we</p>
<p>made that argument, then people said, oh, okay, I get it. And so we went from, it was outrageously</p>
<p>controversial in, you know, 1982 that maybe probably by 1984 or so, people said, oh, yeah,</p>
<p>technically, they&rsquo;ve got a good argument. What are the instructions in the RISC instruction set,</p>
<p>just to get an intuition? Okay. 1995, I was asked to predict the future of what microprocessor</p>
<p>could future. So I, and I&rsquo;d seen these predictions and usually people predict something outrageous</p>
<p>just to be entertaining, right? And so my prediction for 2020 was, you know, things are</p>
<p>going to be pretty much, they&rsquo;re going to look very familiar to what they are. And they are,</p>
<p>and if you were to read the article, you know, the things I said are pretty much true. The</p>
<p>instructions that have been around forever are kind of the same. And that&rsquo;s the outrageous</p>
<p>prediction, actually. Yeah. Given how fast computers have been going. Well, and you know,</p>
<p>Moore&rsquo;s law was going to go on, we thought for 25 more years, you know, who knows, but kind of the</p>
<p>surprising thing, in fact, you know, Hennessy and I, you know, won the ACM, AM, Turing award for</p>
<p>both the RISC instruction set contributions and for that textbook I mentioned. But, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re surprised that here we are 35, 40 years later after we did our work and the conventionalism</p>
<p>of the best way to do instruction sets is still those RISC instruction sets that looked very</p>
<p>similar to what we looked like, you know, we did in the 1980s. So those, surprisingly, there hasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>been some radical new idea, even though we have, you know, a million times as many transistors as</p>
<p>we had back then. But what are the basic constructions and how do they change over the</p>
<p>years? So we&rsquo;re talking about addition, subtraction, these are the specific. So the things that are in</p>
<p>a calculator are in a computer. So any of the buttons that are in the calculator in the computer,</p>
<p>so the, so if there&rsquo;s a memory function key, and like I said, those are, turns into putting</p>
<p>something in memory is called a store, bring something back to load. Just a quick tangent.</p>
<p>When you say memory, what does memory mean? Well, I told you there were five pieces of a computer.</p>
<p>And if you remember in a calculator, there&rsquo;s a memory key. So you want to have intermediate</p>
<p>calculation and bring it back later. So you&rsquo;d hit the memory plus key M plus maybe, and it would</p>
<p>put that into memory and then you&rsquo;d hit an RM like recurrence section and then bring it back</p>
<p>on the display. So you don&rsquo;t have to type it. You don&rsquo;t have to write it down and bring it back</p>
<p>again. So that&rsquo;s exactly what memory is. You can put things into it as temporary storage and bring</p>
<p>it back when you need it later. So that&rsquo;s memory and loads and stores. But the big thing, the</p>
<p>difference between a computer and a calculator is that the computer can make decisions. And</p>
<p>amazingly, decisions are as simple as, is this value less than zero? Or is this value bigger</p>
<p>than that value? And those instructions, which are called conditional branch instructions,</p>
<p>is what give computers all its power. If you were in the early days of computing before</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called the general purpose microprocessor, people would write these instructions kind of in</p>
<p>hardware, but it couldn&rsquo;t make decisions. It would do the same thing over and over again.</p>
<p>With the power of having branch instructions, it can look at things and make decisions</p>
<p>automatically. And it can make these decisions billions of times per second. And amazingly</p>
<p>enough, we can get, thanks to advanced machine learning, we can create programs that can do</p>
<p>something smarter than human beings can do. But if you go down that very basic level, it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>instructions are the keys on the calculator, plus the ability to make decisions, these conditional</p>
<p>branch instructions. And all decisions fundamentally can be reduced down to these</p>
<p>branch instructions. Yeah. So in fact, and so going way back in the stack back to,</p>
<p>we did four RISC projects at Berkeley in the 1980s. They did a couple at Stanford</p>
<p>in the 1980s. In 2010, we decided we wanted to do a new instruction set learning from the mistakes</p>
<p>of those RISC architectures in the 1980s. And that was done here at Berkeley almost exactly</p>
<p>10 years ago. And the people who did it, I participated, but Krzysztof Sanowicz and others</p>
<p>drove it. They called it RISC 5 to honor those RISC, the four RISC projects of the 1980s.</p>
<p>So what does RISC 5 involve? So RISC 5 is another instruction set of vocabulary. It&rsquo;s learned from</p>
<p>the mistakes of the past, but it still has, if you look at the, there&rsquo;s a core set of instructions</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very similar to the simplest architectures from the 1980s. And the big difference about RISC</p>
<p>5 is it&rsquo;s open. So I talked early about proprietary versus open software. So this is an instruction</p>
<p>set. So it&rsquo;s a vocabulary, it&rsquo;s not hardware, but by having an open instruction set, we can have</p>
<p>open source implementations, open source processors that people can use. Where do you see that</p>
<p>going? It&rsquo;s a really exciting possibility, but you&rsquo;re just like in the scientific American,</p>
<p>if you were to predict 10, 20, 30 years from now, that kind of ability to utilize open source</p>
<p>instruction set architectures like RISC 5, what kind of possibilities might that unlock?</p>
<p>Yeah. And so just to make it clear, because this is confusing, the specification of RISC 5 is</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s like in a textbook, there&rsquo;s books about it. So that&rsquo;s defining an interface.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the way you build hardware is you write it in languages that are kind of like C,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re specialized for hardware that gets translated into hardware. And so these</p>
<p>implementations of this specification are the open source. So they&rsquo;re written in something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called Verilog or VHDL, but it&rsquo;s put up on the web, just like you can see the C++ code for</p>
<p>Linux on the web. So that&rsquo;s the open instruction set enables open source implementations of RISC 5.</p>
<p>So you can literally build a processor using this instruction set.</p>
<p>People are, people are. So what happened to us that the story was this was developed here for</p>
<p>our use to do our research. And we made it, we licensed under the Berkeley Software Distribution</p>
<p>License, like a lot of things get licensed here. So other academics use it, they wouldn&rsquo;t be afraid</p>
<p>to use it. And then about 2014, we started getting complaints that we were using it in our research</p>
<p>and in our courses. And we got complaints from people in industries, why did you change your</p>
<p>instruction set between the fall and the spring semester? And well, we get complaints from</p>
<p>industrial time. Why the hell do you care what we do with our instruction set? And then when we</p>
<p>talked to him, we found out there was this thirst for this idea of an open instruction set</p>
<p>architecture. And they had been looking for one. They stumbled upon ours at Berkeley, thought it</p>
<p>was, boy, this looks great. We should use this one. And so once we realized there is this need</p>
<p>for an open instruction set architecture, we thought that&rsquo;s a great idea. And then we started</p>
<p>supporting it and tried to make it happen. So this was kind of, we accidentally stumbled into this</p>
<p>and to this need and our timing was good. And so it&rsquo;s really taking off. There&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you know, universities are good at starting things, but they&rsquo;re not good at sustaining things. So like</p>
<p>Linux has a Linux foundation, there&rsquo;s a RISC 5 foundation that we started. There&rsquo;s an annual</p>
<p>conferences. And the first one was done, I think, January of 2015. And the one that was just last</p>
<p>December in it, you know, it had 50 people at it. And this one last December had, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>1700 people were at it and the companies excited all over the world. So if predicting into the</p>
<p>future, you know, if we were doing 25 years, I would predict that RISC 5 will be, you know,</p>
<p>possibly the most popular instruction set architecture out there, because it&rsquo;s a pretty</p>
<p>good instruction set architecture and it&rsquo;s open and free. And there&rsquo;s no reason lots of people</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t use it. And there&rsquo;s benefits just like Linux is so popular today compared to 20 years</p>
<p>ago. And, you know, the fact that you can get access to it for free, you can modify it, you can</p>
<p>improve it for all those same arguments. And so people collaborate to make it a better system</p>
<p>for everybody to use. And that works in software. And I expect the same thing will happen in</p>
<p>hardware. So if you look at ARM, Intel, MIPS, if you look at just the lay of the land,</p>
<p>and what do you think, just for me, because I&rsquo;m not familiar how difficult this kind of transition</p>
<p>would, how much challenges this kind of transition would entail, do you see,</p>
<p>let me ask my dumb question in another way.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s, I know where you&rsquo;re headed. Well, there&rsquo;s a bunch, I think the thing you point out,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s these very popular proprietary instruction sets, the x86.</p>
<p>And so how do we move to RISC 5 potentially in sort of in the span of 5, 10, 20 years,</p>
<p>a kind of unification, given that the devices, the kind of way we use devices,</p>
<p>IoT, mobile devices, and the cloud keeps changing?</p>
<p>Well, part of it, a big piece of it is the software stack. And right now, looking forward,</p>
<p>there seem to be three important markets. There&rsquo;s the cloud. And the cloud is simply</p>
<p>companies like Alibaba and Amazon and Google, Microsoft, having these giant data centers with</p>
<p>tens of thousands of servers in maybe a hundred of these data centers all over the world.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what the cloud is. So the computer that dominates the cloud is the x86 instruction set.</p>
<p>So the instruction sets used in the cloud are the x86, almost 100% of that today is x86.</p>
<p>The other big thing are cell phones and laptops. Those are the big things today.</p>
<p>I mean, the PC is also dominated by the x86 instruction set, but those sales are dwindling.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s maybe 200 million PCs a year, and there&rsquo;s one and a half billion phones a year.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s numbers like that. So for the phones, that&rsquo;s dominated by ARM.</p>
<p>And now, and a reason that I talked about the software stacks, and the third category is</p>
<p>Internet of Things, which is basically embedded devices, things in your cars and your microwaves</p>
<p>everywhere. So what&rsquo;s different about those three categories is for the cloud, the software that</p>
<p>runs in the cloud is determined by these companies, Alibaba, Amazon, Google, Microsoft. So they</p>
<p>control that software stack. For the cell phones, there&rsquo;s both for Android and Apple, the software</p>
<p>they supply, but both of them have marketplaces where anybody in the world can build software.</p>
<p>And that software is translated or, you know, compiled down and shipped in the vocabulary of ARM.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s referred to as binary compatible because the actual, it&rsquo;s the instructions are</p>
<p>turned into numbers, binary numbers, and shipped around the world.</p>
<p>And sorry, just a quick interruption. So ARM, what is ARM? ARM is an instruction set, like a risk based&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a risk based instruction set. It&rsquo;s a proprietary one. ARM stands for Advanced Risk</p>
<p>Machine. ARM is the name where the company is. So it&rsquo;s a proprietary risk architecture.</p>
<p>So, and it&rsquo;s been around for a while and it&rsquo;s, you know, the, surely the most popular instruction set</p>
<p>in the world right now. They, every year, billions of chips are using the ARM design in this post PC</p>
<p>era. Was it one of the early risk adopters of the risk idea? Yeah. The first ARM goes back,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, 86 or so. So Berkeley instead did their work in the early 80s. The ARM guys needed</p>
<p>an instruction set and they read our papers and it heavily influenced them. So getting back to my</p>
<p>story, what about Internet of Things? Well, software is not shipped in Internet of Things. It&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>embedded device people control that software stack. So the opportunities for risk five,</p>
<p>everybody thinks, is in the Internet of Things embedded things because there&rsquo;s no dominant</p>
<p>player like there is in the cloud or the smartphones. And, you know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of licenses associated with, and you can enhance the instruction set if you want.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, and people have looked at instruction sets and think it&rsquo;s a very good instruction set.</p>
<p>So it appears to be very popular there. It&rsquo;s possible that in the cloud people,</p>
<p>those companies control their software stacks. So it&rsquo;s possible that they would decide to use</p>
<p>risk five if we&rsquo;re talking about 10 and 20 years in the future. The one that would be harder would</p>
<p>be the cell phones. Since people ship software in the ARM instruction set that you&rsquo;d think be</p>
<p>the more difficult one. But if risk five really catches on and, you know, you could,</p>
<p>in a period of a decade, you can imagine that&rsquo;s changing over too. Do you have a sense why risk</p>
<p>five or ARM has dominated? You mentioned these three categories. Why has, why did ARM dominate,</p>
<p>why does it dominate the mobile device space? And maybe my naive intuition is that there are some</p>
<p>aspects of power efficiency that are important that somehow come along with risk. Well, part of it is</p>
<p>for these old CIS construction sets, like in the x86, it was more expensive to these for, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re older, so they have disadvantages in them because they were designed 40 years ago. But also</p>
<p>they have to translate in hardware from CIS constructions to risk constructions on the fly.</p>
<p>And that costs both silicon area that the chips are bigger to be able to do that.</p>
<p>And it uses more power. So ARM has, which has, you know, followed this risk philosophy is</p>
<p>seen to be much more energy efficient. And in today&rsquo;s computer world, both in the cloud</p>
<p>and the cell phone and, you know, things, it isn&rsquo;t, the limiting resource isn&rsquo;t the number of</p>
<p>transistors you can fit in the chip. It&rsquo;s what, how much power can you dissipate for your</p>
<p>application? So by having a reduced instruction set, that&rsquo;s possible to have a simpler hardware,</p>
<p>which is more energy efficient. And energy efficiency is incredibly important in the cloud.</p>
<p>When you have tens of thousands of computers in a data center, you want to have the most energy</p>
<p>efficient ones there as well. And of course, for embedded things running off of batteries,</p>
<p>you want those to be energy efficient and the cell phones too. So I think it&rsquo;s believed that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a energy disadvantage of using these more complex instruction set architectures.</p>
<p>So the other aspect of this is if we look at Apple, Qualcomm, Samsung, Huawei, all use the</p>
<p>ARM architecture, and yet the performance of the systems varies. I mean, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>whose opinion you take on, but you know, Apple for some reason seems to perform better in terms of</p>
<p>these implementation, these architectures. So where&rsquo;s the magic and show the picture.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that happen? Yeah. So what ARM pioneered was a new business model. As they said, well,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s our proprietary instruction set, and we&rsquo;ll give you two ways to do it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll give you one of these implementations written in things like C called Verilog,</p>
<p>and you can just use ours. Well, you have to pay money for that. Not only you pay,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll give you their, you know, we&rsquo;ll license you to do that, or you could design your own. And so</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about numbers like tens of millions of dollars to have the right to design your own,</p>
<p>since they, it&rsquo;s the instruction set belongs to them. So Apple got one of those, the right to</p>
<p>build their own. Most of the other people who build like Android phones just get one of the designs</p>
<p>from ARM to do it themselves. So Apple developed a really good microprocessor design team. They,</p>
<p>you know, acquired a very good team that had, was building other microprocessors and brought them</p>
<p>into the company to build their designs. So the instruction sets are the same, the specifications</p>
<p>are the same, but their hardware design is much more efficient than I think everybody else&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s given Apple an advantage in the marketplace in that the iPhones tend to be the</p>
<p>faster than most everybody else&rsquo;s phones that are there. It&rsquo;d be nice to be able to jump around and</p>
<p>kind of explore different little sides of this, but let me ask one sort of romanticized question.</p>
<p>What to you is the most beautiful aspect or idea of RISC instruction set?</p>
<p>Most beautiful aspect or idea of RISC instruction set or instruction sets or this work that you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done? You know, I&rsquo;m, you know, I was always attracted to the idea of, you know, small is</p>
<p>beautiful, right? Is that the temptation in engineering, it&rsquo;s kind of easy to make things</p>
<p>more complicated. It&rsquo;s harder to come up with a, it&rsquo;s more difficult, surprisingly, to come up with</p>
<p>a simple, elegant solution. And I think that there&rsquo;s a bunch of small features of RISC in general</p>
<p>that, you know, where you can see this examples of keeping it simpler makes it more elegant.</p>
<p>Specifically in RISC 5, which, you know, I was kind of the mentor in the program, but it was</p>
<p>really driven by Krzysztof Sanoviƒá and two grad students, Andrew Waterman and Yen Tsip Li, is they</p>
<p>hit upon this idea of having a subset of instructions, a nice, simple subset instructions,</p>
<p>like 40ish instructions that all software, the software staff RISC 5 can run just on those 40</p>
<p>instructions. And then they provide optional features that could accelerate the performance</p>
<p>instructions that if you needed them could be very helpful, but you don&rsquo;t need to have them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a new, really a new idea. So RISC 5 has right now maybe five optional subsets that</p>
<p>you can pull in, but the software runs without them. If you just want to build the, just the core</p>
<p>40 instructions, that&rsquo;s fine. You can do that. So this is fantastic educationally is you can</p>
<p>explain computers. You only have to explain 40 instructions and not thousands of them. Also,</p>
<p>if you invent some wild and crazy new technology like, you know, biological computing, you&rsquo;d like</p>
<p>a nice, simple instruction set and you can, RISC 5, if you implement those core instructions, you</p>
<p>can run, you know, really interesting programs on top of that. So this idea of a core set of</p>
<p>instructions that the software stack runs on and then optional features that if you turn them on,</p>
<p>the compilers were used, but you don&rsquo;t have to, I think is a powerful idea. What&rsquo;s happened in</p>
<p>the past for the proprietary instruction sets is when they add new instructions, it becomes</p>
<p>required piece. And so that all microprocessors in the future have to use those instructions. So</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like, for a lot of people as they get older, they gain weight, right? That weight and</p>
<p>age are correlated. And so you can see these instruction sets getting bigger and bigger as</p>
<p>they get older. So RISC 5, you know, lets you be as slim as you as a teenager. And you only have to</p>
<p>add these extra features if you&rsquo;re really going to use them rather than you have no choice. You have</p>
<p>to keep growing with the instruction set. I don&rsquo;t know if the analogy holds up, but that&rsquo;s a beautiful</p>
<p>notion that there&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s almost like a nudge towards here&rsquo;s the simple core. That&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>essential. Yeah. And I think the surprising thing is still if we brought back, you know,</p>
<p>the pioneers from the 1950s and showed them the instruction set architectures, they&rsquo;d understand</p>
<p>it. They&rsquo;d say, wow, that doesn&rsquo;t look that different. Well, you know, I&rsquo;m surprised. And</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s, it may be something, you know, to talk about philosophical things. I mean, there may</p>
<p>be something powerful about those, you know, 40 or 50 instructions that all you need is these</p>
<p>commands like these instructions that we talked about. And that is sufficient to build, to bring</p>
<p>up on, you know, artificial intelligence. And so it&rsquo;s a remarkable, surprising to me that as</p>
<p>complicated as it is to build these things, you know, microprocessors where the line widths are</p>
<p>are narrower than the wavelength of light, you know, is this amazing technologies at some</p>
<p>fundamental level. The commands that software executes are really pretty straightforward and</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t changed that much in decades. What a surprising outcome. So underlying all computation,</p>
<p>all Turing machines, all artificial intelligence systems, perhaps might be a very simple instruction</p>
<p>set like a RISC5 or it&rsquo;s. Yeah. I mean, that&rsquo;s kind of what I said. I was interested to see,</p>
<p>I had another more senior faculty colleague and he had written something in Scientific American</p>
<p>and, you know, his 25 years in the future and his turned out about when I was a young professor and</p>
<p>he said, yep, I checked it. And so I was interested to see how that was going to turn out for me. And</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty held up pretty well, but yeah, so there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s probably, there&rsquo;s some, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s, there must be something fundamental about those instructions that we&rsquo;re capable of</p>
<p>creating, you know, intelligence from pretty primitive operations and just doing them really</p>
<p>fast. You kind of mentioned a different, maybe radical computational medium like biological,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s other ideas. So there&rsquo;s a lot of spaces in ASIC, domain specific, and then there</p>
<p>could be quantum computers. And so we can think of all of those different mediums and types of</p>
<p>computation. What&rsquo;s the connection between swapping out different hardware systems and the</p>
<p>instruction set? Do you see those as disjoint or are they fundamentally coupled? Yeah. So what&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>so kind of, if we go back to the history, you know, when Moore&rsquo;s Law is in full effect and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting twice as many transistors every couple of years, you know, kind of the challenge</p>
<p>for computer designers is how can we take advantage of that? How can we turn those transistors into</p>
<p>better computers faster typically? And so there was an era, I guess in the 80s and 90s where</p>
<p>computers were doubling performance every 18 months. And if you weren&rsquo;t around then,</p>
<p>what would happen is you had your computer and your friend&rsquo;s computer, which was like a year,</p>
<p>a year and a half newer, and it was much faster than your computer. And he or she could get their</p>
<p>work done much faster than your computer because it was newer. So people took their computers,</p>
<p>perfectly good computers, and threw them away to buy a newer computer because the computer</p>
<p>one or two years later was so much faster. So that&rsquo;s what the world was like in the 80s and</p>
<p>90s. Well, with the slowing down of Moore&rsquo;s Law, that&rsquo;s no longer true, right? Now with, you know,</p>
<p>not desk side computers with the laptops, I only get a new desk laptop when it breaks,</p>
<p>right? Oh damn, the disk broke or this display broke, I gotta buy a new computer. But before</p>
<p>you would throw them away because it just, they were just so sluggish compared to the latest</p>
<p>computers. So that&rsquo;s, you know, that&rsquo;s a huge change of what&rsquo;s gone on. So, but since this</p>
<p>lasted for decades, kind of programmers and maybe all of society is used to computers getting faster</p>
<p>regularly. We now believe, those of us who are in computer design, it&rsquo;s called computer</p>
<p>architecture, that the path forward is instead is to add accelerators that only work well for</p>
<p>certain applications. So since Moore&rsquo;s Law is slowing down, we don&rsquo;t think general purpose</p>
<p>computers are going to get a lot faster. So the Intel processors of the world are not going to,</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t been getting a lot faster. They&rsquo;ve been barely improving, like a few percent a year.</p>
<p>It used to be doubling every 18 months and now it&rsquo;s doubling every 20 years. So it was just</p>
<p>shocking. So to be able to deliver on what Moore&rsquo;s Law used to do, we think what&rsquo;s going to happen,</p>
<p>what is happening right now is people adding accelerators to their microprocessors that only</p>
<p>work well for some domains. And by sheer coincidence, at the same time that this is happening,</p>
<p>has been this revolution in artificial intelligence called machine learning. So with,</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m sure your other guests have said, you know, AI had these two competing schools of thought is</p>
<p>that we could figure out artificial intelligence by just writing the rules top down, or that was</p>
<p>wrong. You had to look at data and infer what the rules are, the machine learning, and what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happened in the last decade or eight years as machine learning has won. And it turns out that</p>
<p>machine learning, the hardware you build for machine learning is pretty much multiply. The</p>
<p>matrix multiply is a key feature for the way machine learning is done. So that&rsquo;s a godsend</p>
<p>for computer designers. We know how to make matrix multiply run really fast. So general purpose</p>
<p>microprocessors are slowing down. We&rsquo;re adding accelerators for machine learning that fundamentally</p>
<p>are doing matrix multiplies much more efficiently than general purpose computers have done.</p>
<p>So we have to come up with a new way to accelerate things. The danger of only accelerating one</p>
<p>application is how important is that application. Turns out machine learning gets used for all</p>
<p>kinds of things. So serendipitously, we found something to accelerate that&rsquo;s widely applicable.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t even, we&rsquo;re in the middle of this revolution of machine learning. We&rsquo;re not sure</p>
<p>what the limits of machine learning are. So this has been a kind of a godsend. If you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>be able to excel, deliver on improved performance, as long as people are moving their programs to be</p>
<p>embracing more machine learning, we know how to give them more performance even as Moore&rsquo;s law</p>
<p>is slowing down. And counterintuitively, the machine learning mechanism you can say is domain</p>
<p>specific, but because it&rsquo;s leveraging data, it&rsquo;s actually could be very broad in terms of</p>
<p>in terms of the domains it could be applied in. Yeah, that&rsquo;s exactly right. Sort of, it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>sort of people sometimes talk about the idea of software 2.0. We&rsquo;re almost taking another step</p>
<p>up in the abstraction layer in designing machine learning systems, because now you&rsquo;re programming</p>
<p>in the space of data, in the space of hyperparameters, it&rsquo;s changing fundamentally</p>
<p>the nature of programming. And so the specialized devices that accelerate the performance, especially</p>
<p>neural network based machine learning systems might become the new general. Yeah. So the thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s interesting point out these are not coral, these are not tied together. The enthusiasm about</p>
<p>machine learning about creating programs driven from data that we should figure out the answers</p>
<p>from data rather than kind of top down, which classically the way most programming is done</p>
<p>and the way artificial intelligence used to be done. That&rsquo;s a movement that&rsquo;s going on at the</p>
<p>same time. Coincidentally, and the first word machine learning is machines, right? So that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to increase the demand for computing, because instead of programmers being smart, writing those</p>
<p>those things down, we&rsquo;re going to instead use computers to examine a lot of data to kind of</p>
<p>create the programs. That&rsquo;s the idea. And remarkably, this gets used for all kinds of</p>
<p>things very successfully. The image recognition, the language translation, the game playing,</p>
<p>and you know, it gets into pieces of the software stack like databases and stuff like that. We&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not quite sure how general purpose is, but that&rsquo;s going on independent of this hardware stuff.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happening on the hardware side is Moore&rsquo;s law is slowing down right when we need a lot more</p>
<p>cycles. It&rsquo;s failing us, it&rsquo;s failing us right when we need it because there&rsquo;s going to be a</p>
<p>greater increase in computing. And then this idea that we&rsquo;re going to do so called domain</p>
<p>specific. Here&rsquo;s a domain that your greatest fear is you&rsquo;ll make this one thing work and that&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>help, you know, five percent of the people in the world. Well, this looks like it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>general purpose thing. So the timing is fortuitous that if we can perhaps, if we can keep building</p>
<p>hardware that will accelerate machine learning, the neural networks, that&rsquo;ll beat the timing will</p>
<p>be right. That neural network revolution will transform your software, the so called software</p>
<p>2.0. And the software of the future will be very different from the software of the past. And just</p>
<p>as our microprocessors, even though we&rsquo;re still going to have that same basic RISC instructions</p>
<p>to run a big pieces of the software stack like user interfaces and stuff like that,</p>
<p>we can accelerate the kind of the small piece that&rsquo;s computationally intensive. It&rsquo;s not lots</p>
<p>of lines of code, but it takes a lot of cycles to run that code that that&rsquo;s going to be the</p>
<p>accelerator piece. And so that&rsquo;s what makes this from a computer designers perspective a really</p>
<p>interesting decade. What Hennessy and I talked about in the title of our Turing Warrant speech</p>
<p>is a new golden age. We see this as a very exciting decade, much like when we were assistant</p>
<p>professors and the RISC stuff was going on. That was a very exciting time was where we were changing</p>
<p>what was going on. We see this happening again. Tremendous opportunities of people because we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fundamentally changing how software is built and how we&rsquo;re running it. So which layer of the</p>
<p>abstraction do you think most of the acceleration might be happening? If you look in the next 10</p>
<p>years, Google is working on a lot of exciting stuff with the TPU. Sort of there&rsquo;s a closer to</p>
<p>the hardware that could be optimizations around the closer to the instruction set.</p>
<p>There could be optimization at the compiler level. It could be even at the higher level software</p>
<p>stack. Yeah, it&rsquo;s got to be, I mean, if you think about the old RISC Sys debate, it was both,</p>
<p>it was software hardware. It was the compilers improving as well as the architecture improving.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s likely to be the way things are now. With machine learning, they&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>domain specific languages. The languages like TensorFlow and PyTorch are very popular with</p>
<p>the machine learning people. Those are the raising the level of abstraction. It&rsquo;s easier</p>
<p>for people to write machine learning in these domain specific languages like PyTorch and</p>
<p>TensorFlow. So where the most optimization might be happening. Yeah. And so there&rsquo;ll be both the</p>
<p>compiler piece and the hardware piece underneath it. So as you kind of the fatal flaw for hardware</p>
<p>people is to create really great hardware, but not have brought along the compilers. And what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>seeing right now in the marketplace because of this enthusiasm around hardware for machine</p>
<p>learning is getting, you know, probably billions of dollars invested in startup companies. We&rsquo;re</p>
<p>seeing startup companies go belly up because they focus on the hardware, but didn&rsquo;t bring the</p>
<p>software stack along. We talked about benchmarks earlier. So I participated in machine learning</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t really have a set of benchmarks. I think just two years ago, they didn&rsquo;t have a set of</p>
<p>benchmarks. And we&rsquo;ve created something called ML Perf, which is machine learning benchmark suite.</p>
<p>And pretty much the companies who didn&rsquo;t invest in the software stack couldn&rsquo;t run ML Perf very</p>
<p>well. And the ones who did invest in software stack did. And we&rsquo;re seeing, you know, like kind</p>
<p>of in computer architecture, this is what happens. You have these arguments about risk versus this.</p>
<p>People spend billions of dollars in the marketplace to see who wins. It&rsquo;s not a perfect comparison,</p>
<p>but it kind of sorts things out. And we&rsquo;re seeing companies go out of business and then companies</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a company in Israel called Habana. They came up with machine learning accelerators.</p>
<p>They had good ML Perf scores. Intel had acquired a company earlier called Nirvana a couple of years</p>
<p>ago. They didn&rsquo;t reveal their ML Perf scores, which was suspicious. But a month ago, Intel</p>
<p>announced that they&rsquo;re canceling the Nirvana product line and they&rsquo;ve bought Habana for $2</p>
<p>billion. And Intel&rsquo;s going to be shipping Habana chips, which have hardware and software and run</p>
<p>the ML Perf programs pretty well. And that&rsquo;s going to be their product line in the future.</p>
<p>Brilliant. So maybe just to linger briefly on ML Perf. I love metrics. I love standards that</p>
<p>everyone can gather around. What are some interesting aspects of that portfolio of metrics?</p>
<p>Well, one of the interesting metrics is what we thought. I was involved in the start.</p>
<p>Peter Mattson is leading the effort from Google. Google got it off the ground,</p>
<p>but we had to reach out to competitors and say, there&rsquo;s no benchmarks here. We think this is</p>
<p>bad for the field. It&rsquo;ll be much better if we look at examples like in the risk days,</p>
<p>there was an effort to create a&hellip; For the people in the risk community got together,</p>
<p>competitors got together building risk microprocessors to agree on a set of</p>
<p>benchmarks that were called spec. And that was good for the industry. It&rsquo;s rather before</p>
<p>the different risk architectures were arguing, well, you can believe my performance others,</p>
<p>but those other guys are liars. And that didn&rsquo;t do any good. So we agreed on a set of benchmarks</p>
<p>and then we could figure out who was faster between the various risk architectures. But</p>
<p>it was a little bit faster, but that grew the market rather than people were afraid to buy</p>
<p>anything. So we argued the same thing would happen with MLPerf. Companies like Nvidia were maybe</p>
<p>worried that it was some kind of trap, but eventually we all got together to create a</p>
<p>set of benchmarks and do the right thing. And we agree on the results. And so we can see whether</p>
<p>TPUs or GPUs or CPUs are really faster and how much the faster. And I think from an engineer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>perspective, as long as the results are fair, you can live with it. Okay, you kind of tip your hat</p>
<p>to your colleagues at another institution, boy, they did a better job than us. What you hate is</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s false, right? They&rsquo;re making claims and it&rsquo;s just marketing bullshit and that&rsquo;s affecting</p>
<p>sales. So from an engineer&rsquo;s perspective, as long as it&rsquo;s a fair comparison and we don&rsquo;t come in</p>
<p>first place, that&rsquo;s too bad, but it&rsquo;s fair. So we wanted to create that environment for MLPerf.</p>
<p>And so now there&rsquo;s 10 companies, I mean, 10 universities and 50 companies involved. So pretty</p>
<p>much MLPerf is the way you measure machine learning performance. And it didn&rsquo;t exist even</p>
<p>two years ago. One of the cool things that I enjoy about the internet has a few downsides, but one of</p>
<p>the nice things is people can see through BS a little better with the presence of these kinds</p>
<p>of metrics. So it&rsquo;s really nice companies like Google and Facebook and Twitter. Now, it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>cool thing to do is to put your engineers forward and to actually show off how well you do on these</p>
<p>metrics. There&rsquo;s less of a desire to do marketing, less so. In my sort of naive viewpoint.</p>
<p>I was trying to understand what&rsquo;s changed from the 80s in this era. I think because of things</p>
<p>like social networking, Twitter and stuff like that, if you put up bullshit stuff that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>purposely misleading, you can get a violent reaction in social media pointing out the flaws</p>
<p>in your arguments. And so from a marketing perspective, you have to be careful today that</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t have to be careful that there&rsquo;ll be people who put out the flaw. You can get the</p>
<p>word out about the flaws in what you&rsquo;re saying much more easily today than in the past. It used</p>
<p>to be easier to get away with it. And the other thing that&rsquo;s been happening in terms of showing</p>
<p>off engineers is just in the software side, people have largely embraced open source software.</p>
<p>20 years ago, it was a dirty word at Microsoft. And today Microsoft is one of the big proponents</p>
<p>of open source software. That&rsquo;s the standard way most software gets built, which really shows off</p>
<p>your engineers because you can see if you look at the source code, you can see who are making the</p>
<p>commits, who&rsquo;s making the improvements, who are the engineers at all these companies who are</p>
<p>really great programmers and engineers and making really solid contributions,</p>
<p>which enhances their reputations and the reputation of the companies.</p>
<p>LR But that&rsquo;s, of course, not everywhere. Like in the space that I work more in is autonomous</p>
<p>vehicles. And there&rsquo;s still the machinery of hype and marketing is still very strong there. And</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s less willingness to be open in this kind of open source way and sort of benchmark. So</p>
<p>MLPerf represents the machine learning world is much better being open source about holding</p>
<p>itself to standards of different, the amount of incredible benchmarks in terms of the different</p>
<p>computer vision, natural language processing tasks is incredible.</p>
<p>LR Historically, it wasn&rsquo;t always that way.</p>
<p>I had a graduate student working with me, David Martin. So in computer, in some fields,</p>
<p>benchmarking has been around forever. So computer architecture, databases, maybe operating systems,</p>
<p>benchmarks are the way you measure progress. But he was working with me and then started working</p>
<p>with Jitendra Malik. And Jitendra Malik in computer vision space, I guess you&rsquo;ve interviewed</p>
<p>Jitendra. And David Martin told me, they don&rsquo;t have benchmarks. Everybody has their own vision</p>
<p>algorithm and the way, here&rsquo;s my image, look at how well I do. And everybody had their own image.</p>
<p>So David Martin, back when he did his dissertation, figured out a way to do benchmarks. He had a bunch</p>
<p>of graduate students identify images and then ran benchmarks to see which algorithms run well. And</p>
<p>that was, as far as I know, kind of the first time people did benchmarks in computer vision, which</p>
<p>was predated all the things that eventually led to ImageNet and stuff like that. But then the vision</p>
<p>community got religion. And then once we got as far as ImageNet, then that let the guys in Toronto</p>
<p>be able to win the ImageNet competition. And then that changed the whole world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a scary step actually, because when you enter the world of benchmarks, you actually have to be</p>
<p>good to participate as opposed to&hellip; Yeah, you can just, you just believe you&rsquo;re the best in the</p>
<p>world. I think the people, I think they weren&rsquo;t purposely misleading. I think if you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>benchmarks, I mean, how do you know? Your intuition is kind of like the way we did just</p>
<p>do computer architecture. Your intuition is that this is the right instruction set to do this job.</p>
<p>I believe in my experience, my hunch is that&rsquo;s true. We had to get to make things more quantitative</p>
<p>to make progress. And so I just don&rsquo;t know how, you know, in fields that don&rsquo;t have benchmarks,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand how they figure out how they&rsquo;re making progress.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re kind of in the vacuum tube days of quantum computing. What are your thoughts in this wholly</p>
<p>different kind of space of architectures? You know, I actually, you know, quantum computing</p>
<p>is, idea has been around for a while and I actually thought, well, I sure hope I retire</p>
<p>before I have to start teaching this. I&rsquo;d say because I talk about, give these talks about the</p>
<p>slowing of Moore&rsquo;s law and, you know, when we need to change by doing domain specific accelerators,</p>
<p>common questions say, what about quantum computing? The reason that comes up,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in the news all the time. So I think to keep in, the third thing to keep in mind is</p>
<p>quantum computing is not right around the corner. There&rsquo;ve been two national reports,</p>
<p>one by the National Academy of Engineering and other by the Computing Consortium, where they</p>
<p>did a frank assessment of quantum computing. And both of those reports said, you know,</p>
<p>as far as we can tell, before you get error corrected quantum computing, it&rsquo;s a decade away.</p>
<p>So I think of it like nuclear fusion, right? There&rsquo;ve been people who&rsquo;ve been excited about</p>
<p>nuclear fusion a long time. If we ever get nuclear fusion, it&rsquo;s going to be fantastic</p>
<p>for the world. I&rsquo;m glad people are working on it, but, you know, it&rsquo;s not right around the corner.</p>
<p>Those two reports to me say probably it&rsquo;ll be 2030 before quantum computing is something</p>
<p>that could happen. And when it does happen, you know, this is going to be big science stuff. This</p>
<p>is, you know, micro Kelvin, almost absolute zero things that if they vibrate, if truck goes by,</p>
<p>it won&rsquo;t work, right? So this will be in data center stuff. We&rsquo;re not going to have a quantum</p>
<p>cell phone. And it&rsquo;s probably a 2030 kind of thing. So I&rsquo;m happy that our people are working on it,</p>
<p>but just, you know, it&rsquo;s hard with all the news about it, not to think that it&rsquo;s right around the</p>
<p>corner. And that&rsquo;s why we need to do something as Moore&rsquo;s Law is slowing down to provide the</p>
<p>computing, keep computing getting better for this next decade. And, you know, we shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be betting on quantum computing or expecting quantum computing to deliver in the next few</p>
<p>years. It&rsquo;s probably further off. You know, I&rsquo;d be happy to be wrong. It&rsquo;d be great if quantum</p>
<p>computing is going to commercially viable, but it will be a set of applications. It&rsquo;s not a general</p>
<p>purpose computation. So it&rsquo;s going to do some amazing things, but there&rsquo;ll be a lot of things</p>
<p>that probably, you know, the old fashioned computers are going to keep doing better for</p>
<p>quite a while. And there&rsquo;ll be a teenager 50 years from now watching this video saying,</p>
<p>look how silly David Patterson was saying. No, I just said, I said 2030. I didn&rsquo;t say,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say never. We&rsquo;re not going to have quantum cell phones. So he&rsquo;s going to be watching it.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I think this is such a, you know, given that we&rsquo;ve had Moore&rsquo;s Law, I just, I feel</p>
<p>comfortable trying to do projects that are thinking about the next decade. I admire people who are</p>
<p>trying to do things that are 30 years out, but it&rsquo;s such a fast moving field. I just don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how to, I&rsquo;m not good enough to figure out what&rsquo;s the problem is going to be in 30 years. You know,</p>
<p>10 years is hard enough for me. So maybe if it&rsquo;s possible to untangle your intuition a little bit,</p>
<p>I spoke with Jim Keller. I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar with Jim. And he is trying to sort of</p>
<p>be a little bit rebellious and to try to think that he quotes me as being wrong. Yeah. So this,</p>
<p>this is what you&rsquo;re doing for the record. Jim talks about that. He has an intuition that Moore&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Law is not in fact, in fact dead yet. And then it may continue for some time to come.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about Jim&rsquo;s ideas in this space? Yeah, this is just, this is just marketing.</p>
<p>So what Gordon Moore said is a quantitative prediction. We can check the facts, right? Which</p>
<p>is doubling the number of transistors every two years. So we can look back at Intel for the last</p>
<p>five years and ask him, let&rsquo;s look at DRAM chips six years ago. So that would be three, two year</p>
<p>periods. So then our DRAM chips have eight times as many transistors as they did six years ago.</p>
<p>We can look up Intel microprocessors six years ago. If Moore&rsquo;s Law is continuing, it should have</p>
<p>eight times as many transistors as six years ago. The answer in both those cases is no.</p>
<p>The problem has been because Moore&rsquo;s Law was kind of genuinely embraced by the semiconductor</p>
<p>industry as they would make investments in similar equipment to make Moore&rsquo;s Law come true.</p>
<p>Semiconductor improving and Moore&rsquo;s Law in many people&rsquo;s minds are the same thing. So when I say,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m factually correct, that Moore&rsquo;s Law is no longer holds, we are not doubling transistors</p>
<p>every year&rsquo;s years. The downside for a company like Intel is people think that means it&rsquo;s stopped,</p>
<p>that technology has no longer improved. And so Jim is trying to,</p>
<p>counteract the impression that semiconductors are frozen in 2019 are never going to get better.</p>
<p>So I never said that. All I said was Moore&rsquo;s Law is no more. And I&rsquo;m strictly looking at the number</p>
<p>of transistors. That&rsquo;s what Moore&rsquo;s Law is. There&rsquo;s the, I don&rsquo;t know, there&rsquo;s been this aura</p>
<p>associated with Moore&rsquo;s Law that they&rsquo;ve enjoyed for 50 years about, look at the field we&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doubling transistors every two years. What an amazing field, which is an amazing thing that</p>
<p>they were able to pull off. But even as Gordon Moore said, you know, no exponential can last</p>
<p>forever. It lasted for 50 years, which is amazing. And this is a huge impact on the industry because</p>
<p>of these changes that we&rsquo;ve been talking about. So he claims, and I&rsquo;m not going to go into the</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been talking about. So he claims, because he&rsquo;s trying to act on it, he claims,</p>
<p>you know, Patterson says Moore&rsquo;s Law is no more and look at all, look at it, it&rsquo;s still going.</p>
<p>And TSMC, they say it&rsquo;s no longer, but there&rsquo;s quantitative evidence that Moore&rsquo;s Law is not</p>
<p>continuing. So what I say now to try and, okay, I understand the perception problem when I say</p>
<p>Moore&rsquo;s Law has stopped. Okay. So now I say Moore&rsquo;s Law is slowing down. And I think Jim, which is</p>
<p>another way of, if he&rsquo;s, if it&rsquo;s predicting every two years and I say it&rsquo;s slowing down, then that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another way of saying it doesn&rsquo;t hold anymore. And, and I think Jim wouldn&rsquo;t disagree that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>slowing down because that sounds like it&rsquo;s, things are still getting better and just not as fast,</p>
<p>which is another way of saying Moore&rsquo;s Law isn&rsquo;t working anymore.</p>
<p>TG. It&rsquo;s still good for marketing. But what&rsquo;s your, you&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t like expanding the definition of Moore&rsquo;s Law, sort of naturally.</p>
<p>CM. Well, as an educator, you know, is this like modern politics? Does everybody get their own facts?</p>
<p>Or do we have, you know, Moore&rsquo;s Law was a crisp, you know, it was Carver Mead looked at his</p>
<p>Moore&rsquo;s Conversations drawing on a log log scale, a straight line. And that&rsquo;s what the definition of</p>
<p>Moore&rsquo;s Law is. There&rsquo;s this other, what Intel did for a while, interestingly, before Jim joined</p>
<p>them, they said, oh, no, Moore&rsquo;s Law isn&rsquo;t the number of doubling, isn&rsquo;t really doubling</p>
<p>transistors every two years. Moore&rsquo;s Law is the cost of the individual transistor going down,</p>
<p>cutting in half every two years. Now, that&rsquo;s not what he said, but they reinterpreted it</p>
<p>because they believed that the cost of transistors was continuing to drop,</p>
<p>even if they couldn&rsquo;t get twice as many chips. Many people in industry have told me that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>true anymore, that basically in more recent technologies, they got more complicated,</p>
<p>the actual cost of transistor went up. So even the, a corollary might not be true,</p>
<p>but certainly, you know, Moore&rsquo;s Law, that was the beauty of Moore&rsquo;s Law. It was a very simple,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like E equals MC squared, right? It was like, wow, what an amazing prediction. It&rsquo;s so easy</p>
<p>to understand, the implications are amazing, and that&rsquo;s why it was so famous as a prediction.</p>
<p>And this reinterpretation of what it meant and changing is, you know, is revisionist history.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d be happy, and they&rsquo;re not claiming there&rsquo;s a new Moore&rsquo;s Law. They&rsquo;re not saying,</p>
<p>by the way, instead of every two years, it&rsquo;s every three years. I don&rsquo;t think they want to</p>
<p>say that. I think what&rsquo;s going to happen is new technology generations, each one is going to get</p>
<p>a little bit slower. So it is slowing down, the improvements won&rsquo;t be as great, and that&rsquo;s why we</p>
<p>need to do new things. Yeah, I don&rsquo;t like that the idea of Moore&rsquo;s Law is tied up with marketing.</p>
<p>It would be nice if&hellip; Whether it&rsquo;s marketing or it&rsquo;s, well, it could be affecting business,</p>
<p>but it could also be affecting the imagination of engineers. If Intel employees actually believe</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re frozen in 2019, well, that would be bad for Intel. Not just Intel, but everybody.</p>
<p>Moore&rsquo;s Law is inspiring to everybody. But what&rsquo;s happening right now, talking to people</p>
<p>who have working in national offices and stuff like that, a lot of the computer science community</p>
<p>is unaware that this is going on, that we are in an era that&rsquo;s going to need radical change at lower</p>
<p>levels that could affect the whole software stack. If you&rsquo;re using cloud stuff and the</p>
<p>servers that you get next year are basically only a little bit faster than the servers you got this</p>
<p>year, you need to know that, and we need to start innovating to start delivering on it. If you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>counting on your software going to have a lot more features, assuming the computers are going to get</p>
<p>faster, that&rsquo;s not true. So are you going to have to start making your software stack more efficient?</p>
<p>Are you going to have to start learning about machine learning? So it&rsquo;s a warning or call</p>
<p>for arms that the world is changing right now. And a lot of computer science PhDs are unaware</p>
<p>of that. So a way to try and get their attention is to say that Moore&rsquo;s Law is slowing down and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to affect your assumptions. And we&rsquo;re trying to get the word out. And when companies</p>
<p>like TSMC and Intel say, oh, no, no, no, Moore&rsquo;s Law is fine, then people think, oh, hey, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to change my behavior. I&rsquo;ll just get the next servers. And if they start doing measurements,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll realize what&rsquo;s going on. It&rsquo;d be nice to have some transparency on metrics for the lay</p>
<p>person to be able to know if computers are getting faster and not to forget Moore&rsquo;s Law.</p>
<p>Yeah. There are a bunch of, most people kind of use clock rate as a measure of performance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a perfect one, but if you&rsquo;ve noticed clock rates are more or less the same as they were</p>
<p>five years ago, computers are a little better than they are. They haven&rsquo;t made zero progress,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve made small progress. So there&rsquo;s some indications out there. And then our behavior,</p>
<p>right? Nobody buys the next laptop because it&rsquo;s so much faster than the laptop from the past.</p>
<p>For cell phones, I think, I don&rsquo;t know why people buy new cell phones, you know, because</p>
<p>the new ones announced. The cameras are better, but that&rsquo;s kind of domain specific, right? They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>putting special purpose hardware to make the processing of images go much better. So that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the way they&rsquo;re doing it. They&rsquo;re not particularly, it&rsquo;s not that the ARM processor in there is twice</p>
<p>as fast as much as they&rsquo;ve added accelerators to help the experience of the phone. Can we talk a</p>
<p>little bit about one other exciting space, arguably the same level of impact as your work with RISC</p>
<p>is RAID. In 1988, you coauthored a paper, A Case for Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks, hence</p>
<p>RAID RAID. So that&rsquo;s where you introduced the idea of RAID. Incredible that that little,</p>
<p>I mean little, that paper kind of had this ripple effect and had a really a revolutionary effect.</p>
<p>So first, what is RAID? What is RAID? So this is work I did with my colleague Randy Katz and</p>
<p>a star graduate student, Garth Gibson. So we had just done the fourth generation RISC project</p>
<p>and Randy Katz, which had an early Apple Macintosh computer. At this time, everything was done with</p>
<p>floppy disks, which are old technologies that could store things that didn&rsquo;t have much capacity</p>
<p>and you had to get any work done, you&rsquo;re always sticking your little floppy disk in and out because</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t have much capacity. But they started building what are called hard disk drives, which</p>
<p>is magnetic material that can remember information storage for the Mac. And Randy asked the question</p>
<p>when he saw this disk next to his Mac, gee, these are brand new small things. Before that,</p>
<p>for the big computers, the disk would be the size of washing machines. And here&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>the size of a, kind of the size of a book or so. He says, I wonder what we could do with that? Well,</p>
<p>Randy was involved in the fourth generation RISC project here at Berkeley in the 80s. So we figured</p>
<p>out a way how to make the computation part, the processor part go a lot faster, but what about</p>
<p>the storage part? Can we do something to make it faster? So we hit upon the idea of taking a lot of</p>
<p>these disks developed for personal computers and Macintoshes and putting many of them together</p>
<p>instead of one of these washing machine size things. And so we wrote the first draft of the</p>
<p>paper and we&rsquo;d have 40 of these little PC disks instead of one of these washing machine size</p>
<p>things. And they would be much cheaper because they&rsquo;re made for PCs and they could actually kind</p>
<p>of be faster because there was 40 of them rather than one of them. And so we wrote a paper like</p>
<p>that and sent it to one of our former Berkeley students at IBM. And he said, well, this is all</p>
<p>great and good, but what about the reliability of these things? Now you have 40 of these things</p>
<p>and 40 of these devices, each of which are kind of PC quality. So they&rsquo;re not as good as these</p>
<p>IBM washing machines. IBM dominated the storage businesses. So the reliability is going to be</p>
<p>awful. And so when we calculated it out, instead of it breaking on average once a year, it would</p>
<p>break every two weeks. So we thought about the idea and said, well, we got to address the</p>
<p>reliability. So we did it originally performance, but we had to do reliability. So the name</p>
<p>redundant array of inexpensive disks is array of these disks inexpensive like for PCs, but we have</p>
<p>extra copies. So if one breaks, we won&rsquo;t lose all the information. We&rsquo;ll have enough redundancy that</p>
<p>we could let some break and we can still preserve the information. So the name is an array of</p>
<p>inexpensive disks. This is a collection of these PCs and the R part of the name was the redundancy</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;d be reliable. And it turns out if you put a modest number of extra disks in one of</p>
<p>these arrays, it could actually not only be as faster and cheaper than one of these washing</p>
<p>machine disks, it could be actually more reliable because you could have a couple of breaks even</p>
<p>with these cheap disks. Whereas one failure with the washing machine thing would knock it out.</p>
<p>Did you have a sense just like with risk that in the 30 years that followed,</p>
<p>RAID would take over as a mechanism for storage? I think I&rsquo;m naturally an optimist,</p>
<p>but I thought our ideas were right. I thought kind of like Moore&rsquo;s law, it seemed to me,</p>
<p>if you looked at the history of the disk drives, they went from washing machine size things and</p>
<p>they were getting smaller and smaller and the volumes were with the smaller disk drives because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where the PCs were. So we thought that was a technological trend that the volume of disk</p>
<p>drives was going to be getting smaller and smaller devices, which were true. They were the size of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, eight inches diameter, then five inches, then three inches in diameters.</p>
<p>And so that it made sense to figure out how to deal things with an array of disks. So I think</p>
<p>it was one of those things where logically, we think the technological forces were on our side,</p>
<p>that it made sense. So we expected it to catch on, but there was that same kind of business question.</p>
<p>IBM was the big pusher of these disk drives in the real world where the technical advantage</p>
<p>get turned into a business advantage or not. It proved to be true. And so we thought we were</p>
<p>sound technically and it was unclear whether the business side, but we kind of, as academics,</p>
<p>we believe that technology should win and it did. And if you look at those 30 years,</p>
<p>just from your perspective, are there interesting developments in the space of storage</p>
<p>that have happened in that time? Yeah. The big thing that happened, well, a couple of things</p>
<p>that happened, what we did had a modest amount of storage. So as redundancy, as people built bigger</p>
<p>and bigger storage systems, they&rsquo;ve added more redundancy so they could add more failures. And</p>
<p>the biggest thing that happened in storage is for decades, it was based on things physically spinning</p>
<p>called hard disk drives where you used to turn on your computer and it would make a noise.</p>
<p>What that noise was, was the disk drives spinning and they were rotating at like 60 revolutions per</p>
<p>second. And it&rsquo;s like, if you remember the vinyl records, if you&rsquo;ve ever seen those,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it looked like. And there was like a needle like on a vinyl record that was reading it.</p>
<p>So the big drive change is switching that over to a semiconductor technology called flash.</p>
<p>So within the last, I&rsquo;d say about decade is increasing fraction of all the computers in the</p>
<p>world are using semiconductor for storage, the flash drive, instead of being magnetic,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re optical, well, they&rsquo;re a semiconductor writing of information very densely.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been a huge difference. So all the cell phones in the world use flash.</p>
<p>Most of the laptops use flash. All the embedded devices use flash instead of storage. Still in</p>
<p>the cloud, magnetic disks are more economical than flash, but they use both in the cloud.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s been a huge change in the storage industry, the switching from primarily disk</p>
<p>to being primarily semiconductor. For the individual disk, but still the RAID mechanism</p>
<p>applies to those different kinds of disks. Yes. The people will still use RAID ideas</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s kind of what&rsquo;s different, kind of interesting kind of psychologically,</p>
<p>if you think about it. People have always worried about the reliability of computing since the</p>
<p>earliest days. So kind of, but if we&rsquo;re talking about computation, if your computer makes a</p>
<p>mistake and the computer says, the computer has ways to check and say, Oh, we screwed up.</p>
<p>We made a mistake. What happens is that program that was running, you have to redo it,</p>
<p>which is a hassle for storage. If you&rsquo;ve sent important information away and it loses that</p>
<p>information, you go nuts. This is the worst. Oh my God. So if you have a laptop and you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>backing it up on the cloud or something like this, and your disk drive breaks, which it can do,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll lose all that information and you just go crazy. So the importance of reliability</p>
<p>for storage is tremendously higher than the importance of reliability for computation</p>
<p>because of the consequences of it. So yes, so RAID ideas are still very popular, even with</p>
<p>the switch of the technology. Although flash drives are more reliable, if you&rsquo;re not doing</p>
<p>anything like backing it up to get some redundancy so they handle it, you&rsquo;re taking great risks.</p>
<p>You said that for you and possibly for many others, teaching and research don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>conflict with each other as one might suspect. And in fact, they kind of complement each other. So</p>
<p>maybe a question I have is how has teaching helped you in your research or just in your</p>
<p>entirety as a person who both teaches and does research and just thinks and creates new ideas</p>
<p>in this world? Yes, I think what happens is when you&rsquo;re a college student, you know there&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>kind of tenure system in doing research. So kind of this model that is popular in America, I think</p>
<p>America really made it happen, is we can attract these really great faculty to research universities</p>
<p>because they get to do research as well as teach. And that, especially in fast moving fields,</p>
<p>this means people are up to date and they&rsquo;re teaching those kinds of things. But when you run</p>
<p>into a really bad professor, a really bad teacher, I think the students think, well, this guy must be</p>
<p>a great researcher because why else could he be here? So after 40 years at Berkeley, we had a</p>
<p>retirement party and I got a chance to reflect and I looked back at some things. That is not my</p>
<p>experience. I saw a photograph of five of us in the department who won the Distinguished Teaching</p>
<p>Award from campus, a very high honor. I&rsquo;ve got one of those, one of the highest honors. So there are</p>
<p>five of us on that picture. There&rsquo;s Manuel Blum, Richard Karp, me, Randy Kass, and John Osterhaupt,</p>
<p>contemporaries of mine. I mentioned Randy already. All of us are in the National Academy of</p>
<p>Engineering. We&rsquo;ve all run the Distinguished Teaching Award. Blum, Karp, and I all have</p>
<p>Turing Awards. The highest award in computing. So that&rsquo;s the opposite. What&rsquo;s happened is they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>highly correlated. So the other way to think of it, if you&rsquo;re very successful people or maybe</p>
<p>successful at everything they do, it&rsquo;s not an either or. But it&rsquo;s an interesting question</p>
<p>whether specifically, that&rsquo;s probably true, but specifically for teaching, if there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>in teaching that, it&rsquo;s the Richard Feynman idea, is there something about teaching that actually</p>
<p>makes your research, makes you think deeper and more outside the box and more insightful?</p>
<p>Absolutely. I was going to bring up Feynman. I mean, he criticized the Institute of Advanced</p>
<p>Studies. So the Institute of Advanced Studies was this thing that was created near Princeton</p>
<p>where Einstein and all these smart people went. And when he was invited, he thought it was a</p>
<p>terrible idea. This is a university. It was supposed to be heaven, right? A university</p>
<p>without any teaching. But he thought it was a mistake. It&rsquo;s getting up in the classroom and</p>
<p>having to explain things to students and having them ask questions like, well, why is that true,</p>
<p>makes you stop and think. So he thought, and I agree, I think that interaction between a great</p>
<p>research university and having students with bright young minds asking hard questions the</p>
<p>whole time is synergistic. And a university without teaching wouldn&rsquo;t be as vital and</p>
<p>exciting a place. And I think it helps stimulate the research. Another romanticized question,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s your favorite concept or idea to teach? What inspires you or you see inspire the students?</p>
<p>Is there something that pops to mind or puts the fear of God in them? I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>whichever is most effective. I mean, in general, I think people are surprised.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of people who don&rsquo;t think they like teaching come give guest lectures or teach</p>
<p>a course and get hooked on seeing the lights turn on, right? You can explain something to</p>
<p>people that they don&rsquo;t understand. And suddenly they get something that&rsquo;s important and difficult.</p>
<p>And just seeing the lights turn on is a real satisfaction there. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any</p>
<p>specific example of that. It&rsquo;s just the general joy of seeing them understand.</p>
<p>SL. I have to talk about this because I&rsquo;ve wrestled. I do martial arts. Of course, I love wrestling. I&rsquo;m a huge, I&rsquo;m Russian. So I&rsquo;ve talked to Dan Gable on the podcast.</p>
<p>So you wrestled at UCLA among many other things you&rsquo;ve done in your life, competitively in sports</p>
<p>and science and so on. You&rsquo;ve wrestled. Maybe, again, continue with the romanticized questions,</p>
<p>but what have you learned about life and maybe even science from wrestling or from?</p>
<p>CB. Yeah, in fact, I wrestled at UCLA, but also at El Camino Community College. And just right now,</p>
<p>we were in the state of California, we were state champions at El Camino. And in fact, I was talking</p>
<p>to my mom and I got into UCLA, but I decided to go to the community college, which is, it&rsquo;s much</p>
<p>harder to go to UCLA than the community college. And I asked, why did I make that decision? Because I</p>
<p>thought it was because of my girlfriend. She said, well, it was the girlfriend and you thought the</p>
<p>wrestling team was really good. And we were right. We had a great wrestling team. We actually</p>
<p>wrestled against UCLA at a tournament and we beat UCLA as a community college, which just freshmen</p>
<p>and sophomores. And part of the reason I brought this up is I&rsquo;m going to go, they&rsquo;ve invited me back</p>
<p>at El Camino to give a lecture next month. And so, my friend who was on the wrestling team that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re still together, we&rsquo;re right now reaching out to other members of the wrestling team if we can</p>
<p>get together for a reunion. But in terms of me, it was a huge difference. The age cut off, it was</p>
<p>December 1st. And so, I was almost always the youngest person in my class and I matured later</p>
<p>on, our family matured later. So, I was almost always the smallest guy. So, I took kind of</p>
<p>nerdy courses, but I was wrestling. So, wrestling was huge for my self confidence in high school.</p>
<p>And then, I kind of got bigger at El Camino and in college. And so, I had this kind of physical</p>
<p>self confidence and it&rsquo;s translated into research self confidence. And also kind of, I&rsquo;ve had this</p>
<p>feeling even today in my 70s, if something going on in the streets that is bad physically, I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to ignore it. I&rsquo;m going to stand up and try and straighten that out.</p>
<p>And that kind of confidence just carries through the entirety of your life.</p>
<p>Yeah. And the same things happens intellectually. If there&rsquo;s something going on where people are</p>
<p>saying something that&rsquo;s not true, I feel it&rsquo;s my job to stand up just like I would in the street.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s something going on, somebody attacking some woman or something, I&rsquo;m not standing by and</p>
<p>letting that get away. So, I feel it&rsquo;s my job to stand up. So, it&rsquo;s kind of ironically translates.</p>
<p>The other things that turned out for both, I had really great college and high school coaches and</p>
<p>they believed, even though wrestling is an individual sport, that we would be more successful</p>
<p>as a team if we bonded together, do things that we would support each other rather than everybody,</p>
<p>you know, in wrestling it&rsquo;s a one on one and you could be everybody&rsquo;s on their own, but he felt if</p>
<p>we bonded as a team, we&rsquo;d succeed. So, I kind of picked up those skills of how to form successful</p>
<p>teams and how to, from wrestling. And so, I think one of, most people would say one of my strengths</p>
<p>is I can create teams of faculty, large teams of faculty grad students, pull all together for a</p>
<p>common goal and often be successful at it. But I got both of those things from wrestling. Also,</p>
<p>I think I heard this line about if people are in kind of collision, sports with physical contact</p>
<p>like wrestling or football and stuff like that, people are a little bit more assertive or something.</p>
<p>And so, I think that also comes through as, you know, and I didn&rsquo;t shy away from the</p>
<p>racist debates, you know, I enjoyed taking on the arguments and stuff like that. So,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really glad I did wrestling. I think it was really good for my self image and I learned a lot</p>
<p>from it. So, I think that&rsquo;s, you know, sports done well, you know, there&rsquo;s really lots of positives</p>
<p>you can take about it, of leadership, you know, how to form teams and how to be successful.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;ve talked about metrics a lot. There&rsquo;s a really cool, in terms of bench press and</p>
<p>weightlifting, pound years metric that you&rsquo;ve developed that we don&rsquo;t have time to talk about,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a really cool one that people should look into. It&rsquo;s rethinking the way we think about</p>
<p>metrics and weightlifting. But let me talk about metrics more broadly, since that appeals to you</p>
<p>in all forms. Let&rsquo;s look at the most ridiculous, the biggest question of the meaning of life.</p>
<p>If you were to try to put metrics on a life well lived, what would those metrics be?</p>
<p>Yeah, a friend of mine, Randy Katz, said this. He said, you know, when it&rsquo;s time to sign off,</p>
<p>the measure isn&rsquo;t the number of zeros in your bank account, it&rsquo;s the number of inches</p>
<p>in the obituary in the New York Times, was he said it. I think, you know, having,</p>
<p>and you know, this is a cliche, is that people don&rsquo;t die wishing they&rsquo;d spent more time in the</p>
<p>office, right? As I reflect upon my career, there have been, you know, a half a dozen, a dozen things</p>
<p>say I&rsquo;ve been proud of. A lot of them aren&rsquo;t papers or scientific results. Certainly, my family,</p>
<p>my wife, we&rsquo;ve been married more than 50 years, kids and grandkids, that&rsquo;s really precious.</p>
<p>Education things I&rsquo;ve done, I&rsquo;m very proud of, you know, books and courses. I did some help</p>
<p>with underrepresented groups that was effective. So it was interesting to see what were the things</p>
<p>I reflected. You know, I had hundreds of papers, but some of them were the papers, like the risk</p>
<p>rate stuff that I&rsquo;m proud of, but a lot of them were not those things. So people who are, just</p>
<p>spend their lives, you know, going after the dollars or going after all the papers in the</p>
<p>world, you know, that&rsquo;s probably not the things that are afterwards you&rsquo;re going to care about.</p>
<p>When I was, just when I got the offer from Berkeley before I showed up, I read a book where</p>
<p>they interviewed a lot of people in all works of life. And what I got out of that book was the</p>
<p>people who felt good about what they did was the people who affected people, as opposed to things</p>
<p>that were more transitory. So I came into this job assuming that it wasn&rsquo;t going to be the papers,</p>
<p>it was going to be relationships with the people over time that I would value, and that was a</p>
<p>correct assessment, right? It&rsquo;s the people you work with, the people you can influence, the people</p>
<p>you can help, it&rsquo;s the things that you feel good about towards the end of your career. It&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>the stuff that&rsquo;s more transitory.</p>
<p>Trey Lockerbie I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better way to end it than talking about your family,</p>
<p>the over 50 years of being married to your childhood sweetheart.</p>
<p>Richard Averbeck What I think I can add is,</p>
<p>when you tell people you&rsquo;ve been married 50 years, they want to know why.</p>
<p>Trey Lockerbie How? Why?</p>
<p>Richard Averbeck Yeah, I can tell you the nine</p>
<p>magic words that you need to say to your partner to keep a good relationship. And the nine magic</p>
<p>words are, I was wrong. You were right. I love you. Okay. And you got to say all nine. You can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>say, I was wrong. You were right. You&rsquo;re a jerk. You know, you can&rsquo;t say that. So yeah, freely</p>
<p>acknowledging that you made a mistake, the other person was right, and that you love them really</p>
<p>gets over a lot of bumps in the road. So that&rsquo;s what I pass along.</p>
<p>Trey Lockerbie Beautifully put. David,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a huge honor. Thank you so much for the book you&rsquo;ve written, for the research you&rsquo;ve done,</p>
