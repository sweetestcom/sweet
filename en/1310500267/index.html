    <p>The jury found Pfizer guilty of fraud</p>
<p>and racketeering violations.</p>
<p>How does Big Pharma affect your mind?</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s allowed their own opinion.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think everyone&rsquo;s allowed their own scientific facts.</p>
<p>Does Pfizer play by the rules?</p>
<p>Pfizer isn&rsquo;t battling the FDA.</p>
<p>Pfizer has joined the FDA.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with John Abramson,</p>
<p>faculty at Harvard Medical School,</p>
<p>a family physician for over two decades,</p>
<p>and author of the new book, Sickening,</p>
<p>about how Big Pharma broke American healthcare</p>
<p>and how we can fix it.</p>
<p>This conversation with John Abramson</p>
<p>is a critical exploration of the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p>I wanted to talk to John</p>
<p>in order to provide a countervailing perspective</p>
<p>to the one expressed in my podcast episode</p>
<p>with the CEO of Pfizer, Albert Borla.</p>
<p>And here, please allow me to say a few additional words</p>
<p>about this episode with the Pfizer CEO,</p>
<p>and in general, about why I do these conversations</p>
<p>and how I approach them.</p>
<p>If this is not interesting to you, please skip ahead.</p>
<p>What do I hope to do with this podcast?</p>
<p>I want to understand human nature,</p>
<p>the best and the worst of it.</p>
<p>I want to understand how power, money,</p>
<p>and fame changes people.</p>
<p>I want to understand why atrocities are committed</p>
<p>by crowds that believe they&rsquo;re doing good.</p>
<p>All this, ultimately, because I want to understand</p>
<p>how we can build a better world together,</p>
<p>to find hope for the future,</p>
<p>and to rediscover each time,</p>
<p>through the exploration of ideas,</p>
<p>just how beautiful this life is.</p>
<p>This, our human civilization,</p>
<p>in all of its full complexity,</p>
<p>the forces of good and evil,</p>
<p>of war and peace, of hate and love.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I can do this with a heart and mind</p>
<p>that is not open, fragile, and willing to empathize</p>
<p>with all human beings,</p>
<p>even those in the darkest corners of our world.</p>
<p>To attack is easy.</p>
<p>To understand is hard.</p>
<p>And I choose the hard path.</p>
<p>I have learned over the past few months</p>
<p>that this path involves me getting more and more attacked</p>
<p>from all sides.</p>
<p>I will get attacked when I host people</p>
<p>like Jay Bhattacharya or Francis Collins,</p>
<p>Jamie Merzl or Vincent Ricanello,</p>
<p>when I stand for my friend, Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>when I host tech leaders like Mark Zuckerberg,</p>
<p>Elon Musk, and others,</p>
<p>when I eventually talk to Vladimir Putin, Barack Obama,</p>
<p>and other figures that have turned the tides of history.</p>
<p>I have and I will get called stupid, naive, weak,</p>
<p>and I will take these words</p>
<p>with respect, humility, and love, and I will get better.</p>
<p>I will listen, think, learn, and improve.</p>
<p>One thing I can promise is there&rsquo;s no amount of money</p>
<p>or fame that can buy my opinion</p>
<p>or make me go against my principles.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no amount of pressure that can break my integrity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing in this world I need</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t already have.</p>
<p>Life itself is the fundamental gift.</p>
<p>Everything else is just the bonus.</p>
<p>That is freedom.</p>
<p>That is happiness.</p>
<p>If I die today, I will die a happy man.</p>
<p>Now, a few comments about my approach</p>
<p>and lessons learned from the Albert Bourla conversation.</p>
<p>The goal was to reveal as much as I could</p>
<p>about the human being before me</p>
<p>and to give him the opportunity to contemplate in long form</p>
<p>the complexities of his role,</p>
<p>including the tension between making money</p>
<p>and helping people, the corruption</p>
<p>that so often permeates human institutions,</p>
<p>the crafting of narratives through advertisements,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>I only had one hour,</p>
<p>and so this wasn&rsquo;t the time to address these issues deeply</p>
<p>but to show if Albert struggled with them</p>
<p>in the privacy of his own mind,</p>
<p>and if he would let down the veil of political speak</p>
<p>for a time to let me connect with a man</p>
<p>who decades ago chose to become a veterinarian,</p>
<p>who wanted to help lessen the amount of suffering</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>I had no pressure placed on me.</p>
<p>There were no rules.</p>
<p>The questions I was asking were all mine</p>
<p>and not seen by Pfizer folks.</p>
<p>I had no care whether I ever talked to another CEO again.</p>
<p>None of this was part of the calculation</p>
<p>in my limited brain computer.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to grill him.</p>
<p>The way politicians grill CEOs in Congress,</p>
<p>I thought that this approach is easy,</p>
<p>self serving, dehumanizing, and it reveals nothing.</p>
<p>I wanted to reveal the genuine intellectual struggle,</p>
<p>vision, and motivation of a human being,</p>
<p>and if that fails, I trusted the listener</p>
<p>to draw their own conclusion and insights from the result,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s the words spoken</p>
<p>or the words left unspoken or simply the silence.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just it.</p>
<p>I fundamentally trust the intelligence of the listener, you.</p>
<p>In fact, if I criticize the person too hard</p>
<p>or celebrate the person too much,</p>
<p>I feel I fail to give the listener</p>
<p>a picture of the human being that is uncontaminated</p>
<p>by my opinion or the opinion of the crowd.</p>
<p>I trust that you have the fortitude and the courage</p>
<p>to use your own mind, to empathize, and to think.</p>
<p>Two practical lessons I took away.</p>
<p>First, I will more strongly push</p>
<p>for longer conversations of three, four, or more hours</p>
<p>versus just one hour.</p>
<p>60 minutes is too short for the guest to relax</p>
<p>and to think slowly and deeply,</p>
<p>and for me to ask many follow up questions</p>
<p>or follow interesting tangents.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I think it&rsquo;s in the interest of everyone,</p>
<p>including the guest, that we talk in true long form</p>
<p>for many hours.</p>
<p>Second, these conversations with leaders</p>
<p>can be aided by further conversations</p>
<p>with people who wrote books about those leaders</p>
<p>or their industries.</p>
<p>Those that can steel man each perspective</p>
<p>and attempt to give an objective analysis.</p>
<p>I think of Teddy Roosevelt&rsquo;s speech</p>
<p>about the man in the arena.</p>
<p>I want to talk to both the men and women in the arena</p>
<p>and the critics and the supporters in the stands.</p>
<p>For the former, I lean toward wanting to understand</p>
<p>one human being&rsquo;s struggle with the ideas.</p>
<p>For the latter, I lean towards understanding</p>
<p>the ideas themselves.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I wanted to have this conversation</p>
<p>with John Abramson, who is an outspoken critic</p>
<p>of the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p>I hope it helps add context and depth</p>
<p>to the conversation I had with the Pfizer CEO.</p>
<p>In the end, I may do worse than I could have or should have.</p>
<p>Always, I will listen to the criticisms without ego</p>
<p>and I promise I will work hard to improve.</p>
<p>But let me say finally that cynicism is easy.</p>
<p>Optimism, true optimism is hard.</p>
<p>It is the belief that we can and we will</p>
<p>build a better world and that we can only do it together.</p>
<p>This is the fight worth fighting.</p>
<p>So here we go.</p>
<p>Once more into the breach, dear friends.</p>
<p>I love you all.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with John Abramson.</p>
<p>Your faculty at Harvard Medical School,</p>
<p>your family physician for over two decades,</p>
<p>rated one of the best family physicians in Massachusetts,</p>
<p>you wrote the book, Overdose to America,</p>
<p>and the new book coming out now called Sickening</p>
<p>about how Big Pharma broke American healthcare,</p>
<p>including science and research, and how we can fix it.</p>
<p>First question, what is the biggest problem with Big Pharma</p>
<p>that it fixed would be the most impactful?</p>
<p>So if you can snap your fingers and fix one thing,</p>
<p>what would be the most impactful, you think?</p>
<p>The biggest problem is the way they</p>
<p>determine the content, the accuracy,</p>
<p>and the completeness of what doctors believe</p>
<p>to be the full range of knowledge</p>
<p>that they need to best take care of their patients.</p>
<p>So that with the knowledge having been taken over</p>
<p>by the commercial interests, primarily</p>
<p>the pharmaceutical industry, the purpose of that knowledge</p>
<p>is to maximize the profits that get returned</p>
<p>to investors and shareholders, and not to optimize</p>
<p>the health of the American people.</p>
<p>So rebalancing that equation would be the most important</p>
<p>thing to do to get our healthcare back aimed</p>
<p>in the right direction.</p>
<p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s a tension between helping people</p>
<p>and making money, so if we look at particularly</p>
<p>the task of helping people in medicine, in healthcare,</p>
<p>is it possible if money is the primary sort of mechanism</p>
<p>by which you achieve that as a motivator,</p>
<p>is it possible to get that right?</p>
<p>I think it is, Lex, but I think it is not possible</p>
<p>without guardrails that maintain the integrity</p>
<p>and the balance of the knowledge.</p>
<p>Without those guardrails, it&rsquo;s like trying to play</p>
<p>a professional basketball game without referees</p>
<p>and having players call their own fouls.</p>
<p>But the players are paid to win, and you can&rsquo;t count</p>
<p>on them to call their own fouls, so we have referees</p>
<p>who are in charge.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have those referees in American healthcare.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the biggest way that American healthcare</p>
<p>is distinguished from healthcare in other wealthy nations.</p>
<p>So okay, you mentioned Milton Friedman,</p>
<p>and you mentioned his book called Capitalism and Freedom.</p>
<p>He writes that there are only three legitimate functions</p>
<p>of government to preserve law and order,</p>
<p>to enforce private contracts, and to ensure</p>
<p>that private markets work.</p>
<p>You said that that was a radical idea at the time,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re failing on all three.</p>
<p>How are we failing?</p>
<p>And also maybe the bigger picture is what are the strengths</p>
<p>and weaknesses of capitalism when it comes to medicine</p>
<p>and healthcare?</p>
<p>Can we separate those out?</p>
<p>Because those are two huge questions.</p>
<p>So how we&rsquo;re failing on all three,</p>
<p>and these are the minimal functions that our guru</p>
<p>of free market capitalism said the government</p>
<p>should perform, so this is the absolute baseline.</p>
<p>On preserving law and order, the drug companies</p>
<p>routinely violate the law in terms of their marketing,</p>
<p>and in terms of their presentation</p>
<p>of the results of their trials.</p>
<p>I know this because I was an expert in litigation</p>
<p>for about 10 years.</p>
<p>I presented some of what I learned in civil litigation</p>
<p>to the FBI and the Department of Justice,</p>
<p>and that case led to the biggest criminal fine</p>
<p>in US history as of 2009.</p>
<p>And I testified in a federal trial in 2010,</p>
<p>and the jury found Pfizer guilty of fraud</p>
<p>and racketeering violations.</p>
<p>In terms of violating the law, it&rsquo;s a routine occurrence.</p>
<p>The drug companies have paid $38 billion worth of fines</p>
<p>from I think 1991 to 2017.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never been enough to stop the misrepresentation</p>
<p>of their data, and rarely are the fines greater</p>
<p>than the profits that were made.</p>
<p>Executives have not gone to jail for misrepresenting data</p>
<p>that have involved even tens of thousands of deaths</p>
<p>in the case of Vioxx, OxyContin as well.</p>
<p>And when companies plead guilty to felonies,</p>
<p>which is not an unusual occurrence,</p>
<p>the government usually allows the companies,</p>
<p>the parent companies, to allow subsidiaries to take the plea</p>
<p>so that they are not one step closer</p>
<p>to getting disbarred from Medicare,</p>
<p>not being able to participate in Medicare.</p>
<p>So in that sense, there is a mechanism</p>
<p>that is appearing to impose law and order</p>
<p>on drug company behavior, but it&rsquo;s clearly not enough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not working.</p>
<p>Can you actually speak to human nature here?</p>
<p>Are people corrupt?</p>
<p>Are people malevolent?</p>
<p>Are people ignorant that work at the low level</p>
<p>and at the high level at Pfizer, for example,</p>
<p>at big pharma companies, how is this possible?</p>
<p>So I believe, just on a small tangent,</p>
<p>that most people are good.</p>
<p>And I actually believe if you join big pharma,</p>
<p>so a company like Pfizer, your life trajectory</p>
<p>often involves dreaming and wanting</p>
<p>and enjoying helping people.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And so, and then we look at the outcomes</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re describing, and it looks,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why the narrative takes hold</p>
<p>that Pfizer CEO, Al Bobrola, who I talked to, is malevolent.</p>
<p>The sense is these companies are evil.</p>
<p>So if the different parts, the people, are good</p>
<p>and they want to do good, how are we getting these outcomes?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it has to do with the cultural milieu</p>
<p>that this is unfolding in.</p>
<p>And we need to look at sociology to understand this,</p>
<p>that when the cultural milieu is set up</p>
<p>to maximize the returns on investment</p>
<p>for shareholders and other venture capitalists</p>
<p>and hedge funds and so forth,</p>
<p>when that defines the culture</p>
<p>and the higher up you are in the corporation,</p>
<p>the more you&rsquo;re in on the game of getting rewarded</p>
<p>for maximizing the profits of the investors,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the culture they live in.</p>
<p>And it becomes normative behavior</p>
<p>to do things with science that look normal</p>
<p>in that environment and are shared values</p>
<p>within that environment by good people</p>
<p>whose self evaluation becomes modified</p>
<p>by the goals that are shared by the people around them.</p>
<p>And within that milieu, you have one set of standards,</p>
<p>and then the rest of good American people</p>
<p>have the expectation that the drug companies</p>
<p>are trying to make money, but that they&rsquo;re playing</p>
<p>by rules that aren&rsquo;t part of the insider milieu.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating, the game they&rsquo;re playing</p>
<p>modifies the culture of inside the meetings,</p>
<p>inside the rooms, day to day,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a bubble that forms.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re all in bubbles of different sizes.</p>
<p>And that bubble allows you to drift in terms</p>
<p>of what you see as ethical and unethical.</p>
<p>Because you see the game as just part of the game.</p>
<p>So marketing is just part of the game.</p>
<p>Paying the fines is just part of the game of science.</p>
<p>And without guardrails, it becomes</p>
<p>even more part of the game.</p>
<p>You keep moving in that direction.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not bumping up against guardrails.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;ve gotten</p>
<p>to the extreme situation we&rsquo;re in now.</p>
<p>So, like I mentioned, I spoke with Pfizer CEO,</p>
<p>Albert Berla, and I&rsquo;d like to raise with you</p>
<p>some of the concerns I raised with him.</p>
<p>So one, you already mentioned, I raised the concern</p>
<p>that Pfizer&rsquo;s engaged in aggressive advertising campaigns.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, he said no.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re both right.</p>
<p>I think that the, I agree with you,</p>
<p>that the aggressive advertising campaigns</p>
<p>do not add value to society.</p>
<p>And I agree with him that they&rsquo;re, for the most part, legal.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the way the game is played.</p>
<p>Right, so, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>but oftentimes his responses are,</p>
<p>especially now, he&rsquo;s been CEO for only like two years,</p>
<p>three years, he says Pfizer was a different company,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve made mistakes, right, in the past.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t make mistakes anymore.</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s rules, and we play by the rules.</p>
<p>So like, with every concern raised,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s very, very strict rules, as he says.</p>
<p>In fact, he says sometimes way too strict.</p>
<p>And we play by them.</p>
<p>And so in that sense, advertisement,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t seem like it&rsquo;s too aggressive,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s playing by the rules.</p>
<p>And relative to the other, again, it&rsquo;s the game.</p>
<p>Relative to the other companies,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually not that aggressive.</p>
<p>Relative to the other big pharma companies.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, I hope we can quickly get back</p>
<p>to whether or not they&rsquo;re playing by the rules,</p>
<p>but in general.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s just look at the question</p>
<p>of advertising specifically.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a good example of what it looks like</p>
<p>from within that culture, and from outside that culture.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s saying that we follow the law on our advertising.</p>
<p>We state the side effects,</p>
<p>and we state the FDA approved indications,</p>
<p>and we do what the law says we have to do for advertising.</p>
<p>And I have not, I&rsquo;ve not been an expert in litigation</p>
<p>for a few years, and I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on currently,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s take him at his word.</p>
<p>It could be true, it might not be, but it could be.</p>
<p>But if that&rsquo;s true, in his world, in his culture,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ethical business behavior.</p>
<p>From a common sense person&rsquo;s point of view,</p>
<p>a drug company paying highly skilled media folks</p>
<p>to take the information about the drug</p>
<p>and create the illusion, the emotional impact,</p>
<p>and the takeaway message for viewers of advertisements</p>
<p>that grossly exaggerate the benefit of the drug</p>
<p>and minimize the harms, it&rsquo;s sociopathic behavior</p>
<p>to have viewers of ads leave the ad</p>
<p>with an unrealistic impression</p>
<p>of the benefits and harms of the drug.</p>
<p>And yet he&rsquo;s playing by the rules,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s doing his job as CEO</p>
<p>to maximize the effect of his advertising,</p>
<p>and if he doesn&rsquo;t do it, this is a key point,</p>
<p>if he doesn&rsquo;t do it, he&rsquo;ll get fired and the next guy will.</p>
<p>So the people that survive in the company,</p>
<p>the people that get raises in the company,</p>
<p>move up in the company are the ones that play by the rules,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how the game solidifies itself.</p>
<p>But the game is within the bounds of the law.</p>
<p>Sometimes, most of the time, not always.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll return to that question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually more concerned</p>
<p>about the effect of advertisement</p>
<p>in a kind of much larger scale</p>
<p>on the people that are getting funded</p>
<p>by the advertisement in self censorship,</p>
<p>just like more subtle, more passive pressure</p>
<p>to not say anything negative.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve seen this, and I&rsquo;ve been saddened by it,</p>
<p>that people sacrifice integrity in small ways</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re being funded by a particular company.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t see themselves as doing so,</p>
<p>but you can just clearly see that the space of opinions</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re willing to engage in,</p>
<p>or a space of ideas they&rsquo;re willing to play with,</p>
<p>is one that doesn&rsquo;t include negative,</p>
<p>anything that could possibly be negative about the company.</p>
<p>They just choose not to.</p>
<p>Because, you know, why?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really sad to me,</p>
<p>that if you give me a hundred bucks,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m less likely to say something negative about you.</p>
<p>That makes me sad.</p>
<p>Because the reason I wouldn&rsquo;t say something negative</p>
<p>about you, I prefer, is the pressure of friendship</p>
<p>and human connection, those kinds of things.</p>
<p>So I understand that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also a problem, by the way,</p>
<p>sort of having dinners and shaking hands,</p>
<p>and oh, aren&rsquo;t we friends?</p>
<p>But the fact that money has that effect</p>
<p>is really sad to me.</p>
<p>On the news media, on the journalists, on scientists,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s scary to me.</p>
<p>But of course, the direct advertisement to consumers,</p>
<p>like you said, is a potentially very negative effect.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask if what you think</p>
<p>is the most negative impact of advertisement,</p>
<p>is it that direct to consumer on television?</p>
<p>Is it advertisement of the doctors?</p>
<p>Which I&rsquo;m surprised to learn,</p>
<p>I was vaguely looking at,</p>
<p>is more spent on advertising to doctors than to consumers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really confusing to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating, actually.</p>
<p>And then also, obviously, the law side of things</p>
<p>is the lobbying dollars,</p>
<p>which I think is less than all of those.</p>
<p>But anyway, it&rsquo;s in the ballpark.</p>
<p>What concerns you most?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s the whole nexus of influence.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not one thing, and they don&rsquo;t invest all their,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t put all their eggs in one basket.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a whole surround sound program here.</p>
<p>But in terms of advertisements,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take the advertisement.</p>
<p>Trulicity is a diabetes drug,</p>
<p>for type two diabetes, an injectable drug.</p>
<p>And it lowers blood sugar just about as well</p>
<p>as Metformin does.</p>
<p>Metformin costs about $4 a month.</p>
<p>Trulicity costs, I think, $6,200 a year.</p>
<p>So $48 a year versus $6,200.</p>
<p>Trulicity has distinguished itself</p>
<p>because the manufacturer did a study</p>
<p>that showed that it significantly reduces</p>
<p>the risk of cardiovascular disease in diabetics.</p>
<p>And they got approval on the basis of that study,</p>
<p>that very large study being statistically significant.</p>
<p>So the ads obviously extol the virtues of Trulicity</p>
<p>because it reduces the risk of heart disease and stroke,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s one of the major morbidities,</p>
<p>risks of type two diabetes.</p>
<p>What the ad doesn&rsquo;t say is that you have to treat</p>
<p>323 people to prevent one nonfatal event</p>
<p>at a cost of $2.7 million.</p>
<p>And even more importantly than that,</p>
<p>what the ad doesn&rsquo;t say is that the evidence shows</p>
<p>that engaging in an active, healthy lifestyle program</p>
<p>reduces the risk of heart disease and strokes</p>
<p>far more than Trulicity does.</p>
<p>Now, to be fair to the company, the sponsor,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s never been a study that compared Trulicity</p>
<p>to lifestyle changes.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s part of the problem of our advertising.</p>
<p>You would think in a rational society</p>
<p>that was way out on a limb as a lone country</p>
<p>besides New Zealand that allows</p>
<p>direct to consumer advertising,</p>
<p>that part of allowing direct to consumer advertising</p>
<p>would be to mandate that the companies establish</p>
<p>whether their drug is better than,</p>
<p>say, healthy lifestyle adoption</p>
<p>to prevent the problems that they claim to be preventing.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t require that.</p>
<p>So the companies can afford to do very large studies</p>
<p>so that very small differences</p>
<p>become statistically significant.</p>
<p>And their studies are asking the question,</p>
<p>how can we sell more drug?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not asking the question,</p>
<p>how can we prevent cardiovascular disease</p>
<p>in people with type 2 diabetes?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how we get off in this,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re now in the extreme arm of this distortion</p>
<p>of our medical knowledge of studying</p>
<p>how to sell more drugs than how to make people more healthy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really great thing to compare to,</p>
<p>is lifestyle changes.</p>
<p>Because that should be the bar.</p>
<p>If you do some basic diet, exercise,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>how does this drug compare to that?</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>And that study was done, actually, in the 90s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the Diabetes Prevention Program.</p>
<p>It was federally funded by the NIH</p>
<p>so that there wasn&rsquo;t this drug company imperative</p>
<p>to just try to prove your drug was better than nothing.</p>
<p>And it was a very well designed study,</p>
<p>randomized controlled trial</p>
<p>in people who were at high risk of diabetes,</p>
<p>so called pre diabetics.</p>
<p>And they were randomized to three different groups,</p>
<p>a placebo group, a group that got treated with metformin,</p>
<p>and a group that got treated</p>
<p>with intensive lifestyle counseling.</p>
<p>So this study really tested</p>
<p>whether you can get people in a randomized controlled trial</p>
<p>assigned to intensive lifestyle changes,</p>
<p>whether that works.</p>
<p>Now the common wisdom amongst physicians,</p>
<p>and I think in general,</p>
<p>is that you can&rsquo;t get people to change.</p>
<p>You know, you can do whatever you want,</p>
<p>you can stand on your head,</p>
<p>you can beg and plead, people won&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>So give it up and let&rsquo;s just move on with the drugs</p>
<p>and not waste any time.</p>
<p>Except this study that was published</p>
<p>in the New England Journal, I think in 2002,</p>
<p>shows that&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>That the people who were in the intensive lifestyle group</p>
<p>ended up losing 10 pounds,</p>
<p>exercising five times a week, maintaining it,</p>
<p>and reduced their risk of getting diabetes by 58%,</p>
<p>compared to the metformin group,</p>
<p>which reduced its risk of getting diabetes by 31%.</p>
<p>So that exact study was done</p>
<p>and it showed that lifestyle intervention is the winner.</p>
<p>Who, as a small tangent, is the leader,</p>
<p>who is supposed to fight for the side of lifestyle changes?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the big pharma version of lifestyle changes?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s supposed to have the big bully pulpit,</p>
<p>the big money behind lifestyle changes?</p>
<p>In your sense, because that seems to be missing</p>
<p>in a lot of our discussions about health policy.</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>And the answer is that we assume</p>
<p>that the market has to solve all of these problems.</p>
<p>And the market can&rsquo;t solve all of these problems.</p>
<p>There needs to be some way of protecting the public interest</p>
<p>for things that aren&rsquo;t financially driven.</p>
<p>So that the overriding question has to be</p>
<p>how best to improve Americans health,</p>
<p>not companies funding studies to try and prove</p>
<p>that their new inexpensive drug is better</p>
<p>and should be used.</p>
<p>Well, some of that is also people sort of like yourself.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s funny, you spoke with Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>He constantly espouses lifestyle changes.</p>
<p>So some of it is almost like understanding the problems</p>
<p>that big pharma is creating in society</p>
<p>and then sort of these influential voices</p>
<p>speaking up against it.</p>
<p>So whether they&rsquo;re scientists or just regular communicators.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think you gotta tip your hat to Joe</p>
<p>for getting that message out.</p>
<p>And he clearly believes it and does his best.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not coming out in the legitimate avenues,</p>
<p>in the legitimate channels that are evidence based medicine</p>
<p>and from the sources that the docs are trained to listen to</p>
<p>and modify their patient care on.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s not 100%.</p>
<p>I mean, there are articles in the big journals</p>
<p>about the benefits of lifestyle,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t carry the same gravitas</p>
<p>as the randomized controlled trials</p>
<p>that test this drug against placebo</p>
<p>or this drug against another drug.</p>
<p>So the Joe Rogans of the world keep going.</p>
<p>I tip my hat.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not gonna carry the day for most of the people</p>
<p>until it has the legitimacy of the medical establishment.</p>
<p>Yeah, like something that the doctors</p>
<p>really pay attention to.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s an entire mechanism established</p>
<p>for testing drugs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not an entire mechanism established</p>
<p>in terms of scientific rigor of testing lifestyle changes.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s more difficult.</p>
<p>I mean, everything&rsquo;s difficult in science.</p>
<p>That science that involves humans, especially.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just, these studies are very expensive.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re difficult.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to find conclusions</p>
<p>and to control all the variables.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s very easy to dismiss them</p>
<p>unless you really do a huge study that&rsquo;s very well funded.</p>
<p>And so maybe the doctors just lean</p>
<p>towards the simpler studies over and over,</p>
<p>which is what the drug companies fund.</p>
<p>They can control more variables.</p>
<p>See, but the control there is sometimes</p>
<p>by hiding things too, right?</p>
<p>So sometimes you can just say</p>
<p>that this is a well controlled study</p>
<p>by pretending there&rsquo;s a bunch of other stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just ignoring the stuff that could be correlated.</p>
<p>It could be the real cause of the effects you&rsquo;re seeing,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So money can buy ignorance, I suppose, in science.</p>
<p>It buys the kind of blinders that are on</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t look outside the reductionist model.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s another issue is that we kind of,</p>
<p>nobody says to doctors in training,</p>
<p>only listen to reductionist studies and conclusions</p>
<p>and methods of promoting health.</p>
<p>Nobody says that explicitly.</p>
<p>But the respectable science</p>
<p>has to do with controlling the factors.</p>
<p>And I mean, it just doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna pick on trulicity</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such an obvious example,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not more egregious than many others.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me to allow a drug</p>
<p>to be advertised as preventing cardiovascular disease</p>
<p>when you haven&rsquo;t included lifestyle changes</p>
<p>as an arm in the study.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so crystal clear that the purpose of that study</p>
<p>is to sell trulicity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not to prevent cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>If we were in charge, I would try to convince you</p>
<p>that anywhere that study, the results of that study</p>
<p>were presented to physicians,</p>
<p>it would be stamped in big red letters,</p>
<p>this study did not compare trulicity to lifestyle changes.</p>
<p>They need to know that.</p>
<p>And the docs are kind of trained,</p>
<p>these blinders get put on,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re trained to kind of forget that that&rsquo;s not there.</p>
<p>Do you think, so first of all,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a small or big change to advertisement</p>
<p>that seems obvious to say,</p>
<p>like in force that it should be compared</p>
<p>to lifestyle changes.</p>
<p>Do you think advertisements, period,</p>
<p>in the United States for pharmaceutical drugs</p>
<p>should be banned?</p>
<p>I think they can&rsquo;t be banned.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t matter what I think.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s say you were a dictator,</p>
<p>and two, why can&rsquo;t they be banned?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Answer either one.</p>
<p>I believe, I&rsquo;ve been told by lawyers who I trust,</p>
<p>that the freedom of speech in the U.S. Constitution</p>
<p>is such that you can&rsquo;t ban them,</p>
<p>that you could ban cigarettes and alcohol,</p>
<p>which have no therapeutic use,</p>
<p>but drugs have a therapeutic use,</p>
<p>and advertisements about them can&rsquo;t be banned.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume that they can&rsquo;t be,</p>
<p>because we know they won&rsquo;t be anyway,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s assume they can&rsquo;t be,</p>
<p>and especially our Supreme Court now</p>
<p>would be unlikely to take that seriously.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the issue.</p>
<p>The issue is that if the drug companies</p>
<p>want to spend their money advertising,</p>
<p>they should have to have independent analysis</p>
<p>of the message that the viewers are left with</p>
<p>about the drug, so that it&rsquo;s realistic.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the chance the drug will help them?</p>
<p>Well, in true city, it&rsquo;s one out of 323.</p>
<p>322 people aren&rsquo;t gonna benefit</p>
<p>from the cardiovascular reduction, risk reduction.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the true cost?</p>
<p>When drugs advertise that you may be able to get this</p>
<p>for a $25 copay or something,</p>
<p>tens of thousands of dollars a year drug,</p>
<p>for a $25 copay, what an enormous disservice that is</p>
<p>to misrepresent the cost to society.</p>
<p>That should not be allowed.</p>
<p>So you should have to make it clear to the viewers</p>
<p>how many people are gonna benefit,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your chance of benefiting?</p>
<p>How does it compare to lifestyle changes</p>
<p>or less expensive therapies?</p>
<p>What do you give up if you use a less expensive therapy</p>
<p>or gain, perhaps?</p>
<p>And how much it costs.</p>
<p>How much it costs.</p>
<p>Now, that can go either way,</p>
<p>because if you say Humira costs $72,000</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s no more effective as a first line drug</p>
<p>than methotrexate, which costs $480,</p>
<p>people might say, I want the expensive drug</p>
<p>because I can get it for a $25 copay.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d have to temper that a little bit.</p>
<p>Oh, you mean people are so, they don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Their insurance is gonna cover it and it&rsquo;s a $25 copay,</p>
<p>but we could figure out how to deal with that.</p>
<p>The main point is that if we assume</p>
<p>that advertisements are gonna keep going, and they are,</p>
<p>we could require that there be outside evaluation</p>
<p>of the message that reasonable, unbiased viewers</p>
<p>take away from the ads,</p>
<p>and the ads would have to tell the truth about the drug.</p>
<p>And the truth should have sub truth guardrails,</p>
<p>meaning like the cost that we talked about,</p>
<p>the effects compared to things that actually,</p>
<p>lifestyle changes, just these details,</p>
<p>very strict guardrails of what actually has to be specified.</p>
<p>And I would make it against the law</p>
<p>to have family picnics or dogs catching Frisbees in the ads.</p>
<p>So, you mean 95% of the ads, yes.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s something dark and inauthentic</p>
<p>about those advertisements, but they seem,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re being done</p>
<p>because they work for the target audience.</p>
<p>And then the doctors too.</p>
<p>Can you really buy a doctor&rsquo;s opinion?</p>
<p>Why does it have such an effect on doctors?</p>
<p>Advertisement to doctors, like you as a physician,</p>
<p>again, like from everything I&rsquo;ve seen, people love you.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve just, people should definitely look you up from,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of videos of you giving talks on YouTube,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s so refreshing to hear</p>
<p>just the clarity of thought about health policy,</p>
<p>about healthcare, just the way you think</p>
<p>throughout the years.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>So like, it&rsquo;s easy to think about like,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re criticizing Big Pharma,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one part of the message that you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not like, your brilliance actually shines</p>
<p>in the positive, in the solutions and how to do it.</p>
<p>So as a doctor, what affects your mind?</p>
<p>And how does Big Pharma affect your mind?</p>
<p>Number one, the information that comes through</p>
<p>legitimate sources that doctors have been taught</p>
<p>to rely on, evidence based medicine,</p>
<p>the articles in peer reviewed journals,</p>
<p>the guidelines that are issued.</p>
<p>Now, those are problematic,</p>
<p>because when an article is peer reviewed</p>
<p>and published in a respected journal,</p>
<p>people and doctors obviously assume</p>
<p>that the peer reviewers have had access to the data</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve independently analyzed the data,</p>
<p>and they corroborate the findings in the manuscript</p>
<p>that was submitted, or they give feedback to the authors</p>
<p>and say, we disagree with you on this point,</p>
<p>and would you please check our analysis</p>
<p>and if you agree with us, make it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they assume the peer review process is,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>The peer reviewers don&rsquo;t have the data.</p>
<p>The peer reviewers have the manuscript</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been submitted by the,</p>
<p>usually in conjunction with or by the drug company</p>
<p>that manufactures the drug.</p>
<p>So peer reviewers are unable to perform the job</p>
<p>that doctors think they&rsquo;re performing</p>
<p>to vet the data to assure that it&rsquo;s accurate</p>
<p>and reasonably complete.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>And then we have the clinical practice guidelines,</p>
<p>which are increasingly more important</p>
<p>as the information, the flow of information</p>
<p>keeps getting brisker and brisker,</p>
<p>and docs need to get to the bottom line quickly.</p>
<p>Clinical practice guidelines become much more important.</p>
<p>And we assume that the authors</p>
<p>of those clinical practice guidelines</p>
<p>have independently analyzed the data</p>
<p>from the clinical trials and make their recommendations</p>
<p>that set the standards of care based on their analysis.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what happens.</p>
<p>The experts who write the clinical trials</p>
<p>rely almost entirely on the publications</p>
<p>presenting the results of the clinical trials,</p>
<p>which are peer reviewed,</p>
<p>but the peer reviewers haven&rsquo;t had access to the data.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got a system of the highest level of evidence</p>
<p>that doctors have been trained over and over again</p>
<p>to rely on to practice evidence based medicine</p>
<p>to be good doctors that has not been verified.</p>
<p>Do you think that data that&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>from the pharma companies,</p>
<p>do you think there,</p>
<p>what level of manipulation is going on with that data?</p>
<p>Is it at the study design level?</p>
<p>Is it at literally there&rsquo;s some data</p>
<p>that you just keep off, keep out of the charts,</p>
<p>keep out of the aggregate analysis that you then publish?</p>
<p>Or is it the worst case,</p>
<p>which is just change some of the numbers?</p>
<p>It happened.</p>
<p>All three happened.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know what the denominator is,</p>
<p>but I spent about 10 years in litigation.</p>
<p>And for example, in Vioxx,</p>
<p>which was withdrawn from the market in 2004</p>
<p>in the biggest drug recall in American history,</p>
<p>the problem was that it got recalled</p>
<p>when a study that Merck sponsored</p>
<p>showed that Vioxx doubled the risk,</p>
<p>more than doubled the risk of heart attacks,</p>
<p>strokes, and blood clots, serious blood clots.</p>
<p>It got pulled then.</p>
<p>But there was a study, a bigger study</p>
<p>that had been published in 2000</p>
<p>in the New England Journal of Medicine</p>
<p>that showed that Vioxx was a better drug</p>
<p>for arthritis and pain,</p>
<p>not because it was more effective.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no more effective than Aleve or Advil,</p>
<p>but because it was less likely</p>
<p>to cause serious GI complications,</p>
<p>bleeds and perforations in the gut.</p>
<p>Now, in that study that was published</p>
<p>in the New England Journal that was never corrected,</p>
<p>it was a little bit modified 15 months</p>
<p>after the drug was taken off the market,</p>
<p>but never corrected, Merck left out three heart attacks.</p>
<p>And the FDA knew that Merck left out three heart attacks,</p>
<p>and the FDA&rsquo;s analysis of the data from that study</p>
<p>said that the FDA wasn&rsquo;t gonna do the analysis</p>
<p>without the three heart attacks in it.</p>
<p>And the important part of this story</p>
<p>is that there were 12 authors listed on that study</p>
<p>in the New England Journal.</p>
<p>Two were Merck employees.</p>
<p>They knew about the three heart attacks</p>
<p>that had been omitted.</p>
<p>The other 10 authors, the academic authors,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know about it.</p>
<p>They hadn&rsquo;t seen that data.</p>
<p>So Merck just, they had an excuse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s complicated, and the FDA didn&rsquo;t accept it,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s no reason to go into it.</p>
<p>But Merck just left out the three heart attacks.</p>
<p>And the three heart attacks,</p>
<p>it may seem three heart attacks in a 10,000 person study</p>
<p>may seem like nothing,</p>
<p>except they completely changed the statistics</p>
<p>so that had the three heart attacks been included,</p>
<p>the only conclusion that Merck could have made</p>
<p>was that Vioxx significantly increased</p>
<p>the risk of heart attack.</p>
<p>And they abbreviated their endpoint</p>
<p>from heart attack, strokes, and blood clots</p>
<p>to just heart attacks.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So those are, maybe in their mind,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re also playing by the rules</p>
<p>because of some technical excuse that you mentioned</p>
<p>that was rejected.</p>
<p>How can this, because this is crossing the line.</p>
<p>No, no, let me interrupt.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>The study was completed.</p>
<p>The blind was broken, meaning they looked at the data.</p>
<p>In March of 2000, the article was published</p>
<p>in the New England Journal in November of 2000.</p>
<p>In March of 2000, there was an email by the head scientist</p>
<p>that was published in the Wall Street Journal</p>
<p>that said the day that the data were unblinded,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a shame that the cardiovascular events are there,</p>
<p>but the drug will do well and we will do well.</p>
<p>But removing the three heart attacks,</p>
<p>how does that happen?</p>
<p>Like who has to convince themselves?</p>
<p>Is this pure malevolence?</p>
<p>You have to be the judge of that,</p>
<p>but the person who was in charge of the Data Safety</p>
<p>Monitoring Board issued a letter that said</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll stop counting cardiovascular events</p>
<p>a month before the trial is over</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll continue counting GI events.</p>
<p>And that person got a contract to consult with Merck</p>
<p>for $5,000 a day, I think for 12 days a year,</p>
<p>for one or two years that was signed, that contract</p>
<p>was signed within two weeks of the decision</p>
<p>to stop counting heart attacks.</p>
<p>I wanna understand that man or woman.</p>
<p>I wanna, I want, it&rsquo;s the, I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot</p>
<p>about Nazi Germany and thinking a lot</p>
<p>about the good Germans because I want to understand</p>
<p>so that we can each encourage each other</p>
<p>to take the small heroic actions that prevents that.</p>
<p>Because it feels to me, removing malevolence</p>
<p>from the table where it&rsquo;s just a pure psychopathic person,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s just a momentum created</p>
<p>by the game like you mentioned.</p>
<p>And so it takes reversing the momentum within the company,</p>
<p>I think requires many small acts of heroism.</p>
<p>Not gigantic, I&rsquo;m going to leave and become a whistleblower</p>
<p>and publish a book about it.</p>
<p>But small, quiet acts of pressuring against this.</p>
<p>Like, what are we doing here?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to help people.</p>
<p>Is this the right thing to do?</p>
<p>Looking in the mirror constantly asking,</p>
<p>is this the right thing to do?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s how, that&rsquo;s what integrity is.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the pressures you&rsquo;re under</p>
<p>and then still be able to zoom out</p>
<p>and think what is the right thing to do here.</p>
<p>But the data, hiding the data makes it too easy</p>
<p>to live in ignorance.</p>
<p>So like within those, inside those companies.</p>
<p>So your idea is that the reviewers should see the data.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one step.</p>
<p>So to even push back on that idea is,</p>
<p>I assume you mean the data remains private</p>
<p>except to the peer reviews, reviewers.</p>
<p>The problem with, of course, as you probably know</p>
<p>is the peer review process is not perfect.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s individuals.</p>
<p>It feels like there should be a lot more eyes on the data</p>
<p>than just the peer reviewers.</p>
<p>Yes, this is not a hard problem to solve.</p>
<p>When a study is completed,</p>
<p>a clinical study report is made.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s usually several thousand pages.</p>
<p>And what it does is it takes the raw patient data</p>
<p>and it tabulates it in the ways it&rsquo;s supposedly and usually</p>
<p>in the ways that the company has pre specified.</p>
<p>So that you then end up with a searchable,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say 3000 page document.</p>
<p>As I became more experienced as an expert in litigation,</p>
<p>I could go through those documents pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Quickly may mean 20 hours or 40 hours,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t mean three months of my work.</p>
<p>And see if the companies,</p>
<p>if the way the company has analyzed the data</p>
<p>is consistent with the way,</p>
<p>with their statistical analysis plan</p>
<p>and their pre specified outcome measures.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not hard.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Peer reviewers, I don&rsquo;t peer review clinical trials,</p>
<p>but I peer review other kinds of articles.</p>
<p>I have to do one on the airplane on the way home.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re just ordinary mortal people volunteering to.</p>
<p>Unpaid, the motivation is not clear.</p>
<p>The motivation is to keep,</p>
<p>to be a good citizen in the medical community</p>
<p>and to be on friendly terms with the journals</p>
<p>so that if you wanna get published,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s sort of an unspoken incentive.</p>
<p>As somebody who enjoys game theory,</p>
<p>I feel like that motivation is good,</p>
<p>but it could be a lot better.</p>
<p>Yes, you should get more recognition</p>
<p>or in some way academic credit for it.</p>
<p>It should go to your career advancement.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s an important paper</p>
<p>and you recognize it&rsquo;s an important paper</p>
<p>as a great peer reviewer,</p>
<p>that this is not in that area</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like clearly a piece of crap paper</p>
<p>or clearly an awesome paper</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t have controversial aspects to it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just a beautiful piece of work.</p>
<p>Okay, those are easy.</p>
<p>And then there is like the very difficult gray area,</p>
<p>which may require many, many days of work</p>
<p>on your part as a peer reviewer.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just a couple hours,</p>
<p>but really seriously reading.</p>
<p>Like some papers can take months to really understand.</p>
<p>So if you really wanna struggle,</p>
<p>there has to be an incentive for that struggle.</p>
<p>Yes, and billions of dollars ride on some of these studies.</p>
<p>And lives, right, not to mention.</p>
<p>Right, but it would be easy to have full time statisticians</p>
<p>hired by the journals or shared by the journals</p>
<p>who were independent of any other financial incentive</p>
<p>to go over these kind of methodological issues</p>
<p>and take responsibility for certifying the analyses</p>
<p>that are done and then pass it on</p>
<p>to the volunteer peer reviewers.</p>
<p>See, I believe even in this,</p>
<p>in the sort of capitalism or even social capital,</p>
<p>after watching Twitter in the time of COVID</p>
<p>and just looking at people that investigate themselves,</p>
<p>I believe in the citizenry.</p>
<p>People, if you give them access to the data,</p>
<p>like these like citizen scientists arise.</p>
<p>A lot of them on the, it&rsquo;s kind of funny,</p>
<p>a lot of people that are just really used</p>
<p>to working with data,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know anything about medicine</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t have actually the biases</p>
<p>that a lot of doctors and medical</p>
<p>and a lot of the people that read these papers,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll just go raw into the data</p>
<p>and look at it with like they&rsquo;re bored almost</p>
<p>and they do incredible analysis.</p>
<p>So I, you know, there&rsquo;s some argument to be made</p>
<p>for a lot of this data to become public,</p>
<p>like deanonymized, no, sorry, anonymized,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff, but for a lot of it to be public,</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re talking about things</p>
<p>as impactful as some of these drugs.</p>
<p>I agree 100%, so let&rsquo;s turn the micro,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get a little bit more granular.</p>
<p>On the peer review issue,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about pre publication transparencies</p>
<p>and that is critically important.</p>
<p>Once a paper is published, the horses are out of the barn</p>
<p>and docs are gonna read it,</p>
<p>take it as evidence based medicine.</p>
<p>The economists call what then happens as stickiness</p>
<p>that the docs hold on to their beliefs</p>
<p>and my own voice inside says,</p>
<p>once doctors start doing things to their patients bodies,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really not too enthusiastic</p>
<p>about hearing it was wrong.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the stickiness of human nature.</p>
<p>Wow, so that bar, once it&rsquo;s published,</p>
<p>the doctors, that&rsquo;s when the stickiness emerges, wow.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s hard to put that toothpaste back in the tube.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s pre publication transparency,</p>
<p>which is essential and you could have,</p>
<p>whoever saw that data pre publication</p>
<p>could sign confidentiality agreements</p>
<p>so that the drug companies couldn&rsquo;t argue</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re just opening the spigots of our data</p>
<p>and people can copy it and blah, all the excuses they make.</p>
<p>You could argue that you didn&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s just let them do it.</p>
<p>Let the peer reviewers sign confidentiality agreements</p>
<p>and they won&rsquo;t leak the data</p>
<p>but then you have to go to post publication transparency,</p>
<p>which is what you were just getting at</p>
<p>to let the data free and let citizens</p>
<p>and citizen scientists and other doctors</p>
<p>who are interested have at it.</p>
<p>Kind of like Wiki, Wikipedia, have at it.</p>
<p>Let it out and let people criticize each other.</p>
<p>Okay, so speaking of the data,</p>
<p>the FDA asked 55 years to release Pfizer vaccine data.</p>
<p>This is also something I raised with Albert Bourla.</p>
<p>What did he say?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s several things I didn&rsquo;t like about what he said.</p>
<p>So some things are expected</p>
<p>and some of it is just revealing the human being,</p>
<p>which is what I&rsquo;m interested in doing.</p>
<p>But he said he wasn&rsquo;t aware of the 75 and the 55.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, wait a minute.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t aware of?</p>
<p>The how long, so here I&rsquo;ll explain what he.</p>
<p>Do you know that since you spoke to him,</p>
<p>Pfizer has petitioned the judge to join the suit</p>
<p>in behalf of the FDA&rsquo;s request</p>
<p>to release that data over 55 or 75 years?</p>
<p>Pfizer&rsquo;s fully aware of what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s aware.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s aware in some formulation.</p>
<p>The exact years he might have not been aware.</p>
<p>But the point is that there is,</p>
<p>that is the FDA, the relationship of Pfizer and the FDA</p>
<p>in terms of me being able to read human beings</p>
<p>was the thing he was most uncomfortable with,</p>
<p>that he didn&rsquo;t wanna talk about the FDA.</p>
<p>And that really, it was clear</p>
<p>that there was a relationship there</p>
<p>that if the words you use may do a lot of harm,</p>
<p>potentially because like you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>there might be lawsuits going on, there&rsquo;s litigation,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s legal stuff, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a lot of games being played in this space.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know how to interpret it</p>
<p>if he&rsquo;s actually aware or not,</p>
<p>but the deeper truth is that he&rsquo;s deeply uncomfortable</p>
<p>bringing light to this part of the game.</p>
<p>Yes, and I&rsquo;m gonna read between the lines</p>
<p>and Albert Borla certainly didn&rsquo;t ask me to speak for him.</p>
<p>But I think, but when did you speak to him?</p>
<p>How long ago?</p>
<p>Wow, time flies when you&rsquo;re having fun.</p>
<p>Two months ago.</p>
<p>So that was just recently it&rsquo;s come out,</p>
<p>just in the past week it&rsquo;s come out</p>
<p>that Pfizer isn&rsquo;t battling the FDA.</p>
<p>Pfizer has joined the FDA in the opposition to the request</p>
<p>to release these documents in the same amount of time</p>
<p>that the FDA took to evaluate them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So Pfizer is offering to help the FDA</p>
<p>to petition the judge to not enforce the timeline</p>
<p>that he seems to be moving towards.</p>
<p>So for people who are not familiar,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about the Freedom of Information Act request</p>
<p>to release the Pfizer vaccine data, study data</p>
<p>to release as much of the data as possible,</p>
<p>like the raw data, the details,</p>
<p>or actually not even the raw data,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s data, doesn&rsquo;t matter, there&rsquo;s details to it.</p>
<p>And I think the response from the FDA is that of course,</p>
<p>yes, of course, but we can only publish</p>
<p>we can only publish like some X number of pages a day.</p>
<p>500 pages.</p>
<p>500 pages of data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a day though, it&rsquo;s a week I think.</p>
<p>The point is whatever they&rsquo;re able to publish is ridiculous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like my printer can only print three pages a day</p>
<p>and we cannot afford a second printer.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s some kind of bureaucratic language for,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a process to this, and now you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>that Pfizer is obviously more engaged</p>
<p>in helping this kind of bureaucratic process prosper</p>
<p>in its full absurdity, Kafkaesque absurdity.</p>
<p>So what is this?</p>
<p>This really bothered people.</p>
<p>This really.</p>
<p>This is really troublesome.</p>
<p>And just to put it in just plain English terms,</p>
<p>Pfizer&rsquo;s making the case that it can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>the FDA and Pfizer together are making the case</p>
<p>that they can&rsquo;t go through the documents.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna take them some number of hundredfold,</p>
<p>hundreds of folds more time to go through the documents</p>
<p>than the FDA required to go through the documents</p>
<p>to approve the vaccines,</p>
<p>to give the vaccines full FDA approval.</p>
<p>And the FDA&rsquo;s argument, talk about Kafkaesque,</p>
<p>is that to do it more rapidly</p>
<p>would cost them $3 million.</p>
<p>$3 million equals one hour of vaccine sales over two years.</p>
<p>One hour of sales.</p>
<p>And they can&rsquo;t come up with the money.</p>
<p>And now Pfizer has joined the suit</p>
<p>to help the FDA fight off this judge, this mean judge,</p>
<p>who thinks they ought to release the data.</p>
<p>But evidently Pfizer isn&rsquo;t offering</p>
<p>to come up with the $3 million either.</p>
<p>So, but for $3 million, I mean, maybe,</p>
<p>maybe the FDA should do a GoFundMe campaign.</p>
<p>Well, obviously the money thing,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sure if Elon Musk comes along and says,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you $100 million, publish it now,</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;ll come up with another.</p>
<p>So, I mean, it&rsquo;s clear that there&rsquo;s cautiousness.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the source of it from the FDA.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only one explanation that I can think of,</p>
<p>which is that the FDA and Pfizer</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t wanna release the data.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t wanna release the three</p>
<p>or 500,000 pages of documents.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s in there.</p>
<p>I wanna say one thing very clearly.</p>
<p>I am not an anti faxer.</p>
<p>I believe the vaccines work.</p>
<p>I believe everybody should get vaccinated.</p>
<p>The evidence is clear that if you&rsquo;re vaccinated,</p>
<p>you reduce your risk of dying of COVID by 20 fold.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve got new sub variants coming along.</p>
<p>And I just wanna be very clear about this.</p>
<p>That said, there&rsquo;s something I would give you 10 to one odds</p>
<p>on a bet that there&rsquo;s something in that data</p>
<p>that is gonna be embarrassing to either FDA or Pfizer</p>
<p>or both.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s two options.</p>
<p>I agree with you 100%.</p>
<p>One is they know of embarrassing things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s option one.</p>
<p>And option two, they haven&rsquo;t invested enough</p>
<p>to truly understand the data.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, it&rsquo;s a lot of data</p>
<p>that they have a sense</p>
<p>that might be something embarrassing in there.</p>
<p>And if we release it,</p>
<p>surely the world will discover the embarrassing</p>
<p>and to do a sort of the steel man their argument.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll take the small, the press,</p>
<p>the people will take the small embarrassing things</p>
<p>and blow them up into big things.</p>
<p>Yes, and support the anti vax campaign.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s all possible.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the data are about the original clinical trial.</p>
<p>And the emergency use authorization was based</p>
<p>on the first few months of the data from that trial.</p>
<p>And it was a two year trial.</p>
<p>The rest of that data has not been opened up</p>
<p>and there was not an advisory committee meeting</p>
<p>to look at that data</p>
<p>when the FDA granted full authorization.</p>
<p>Again, I am pro vaccine.</p>
<p>I am not making an anti vax argument here.</p>
<p>But I suspect that there&rsquo;s something pretty serious</p>
<p>in that data.</p>
<p>And the reason why I&rsquo;m not an anti vaxxer,</p>
<p>having not been able to see the data</p>
<p>that the FDA and Pfizer seem to willing</p>
<p>not just to put effort into preventing the release of,</p>
<p>but seem to have quite a bit of energy</p>
<p>into preventing, invest quite a bit of energy</p>
<p>in not releasing that data.</p>
<p>The reason why that doesn&rsquo;t tip me over</p>
<p>into the anti vaxxer side</p>
<p>is because that&rsquo;s clinical trial data,</p>
<p>early clinical trial data</p>
<p>that involved several thousand people.</p>
<p>We now have millions of data points</p>
<p>from people who have had the vaccine.</p>
<p>This is real world data,</p>
<p>showing the efficacy of the vaccines.</p>
<p>And so far, knock on wood,</p>
<p>there aren&rsquo;t side effects</p>
<p>that overcome the benefits of vaccine.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m with you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now, I guess, three shots of the vaccine.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot of people that are kind of saying,</p>
<p>well, even the data on the real world use large scale data</p>
<p>is messy.</p>
<p>The way it&rsquo;s being reported,</p>
<p>the way it&rsquo;s being interpreted.</p>
<p>Well, one thing is clear to me</p>
<p>that it is being politicized.</p>
<p>I mean, if you just look objectively,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to go to at the shallow surface level.</p>
<p>It seems like there&rsquo;s two groups</p>
<p>that I can&rsquo;t even put a term to it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not really pro vaccine versus anti vaccine</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s pro vaccine, triple mask, Democrat, liberal,</p>
<p>and then anti mandate, whatever those groups are.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t quite, cause they&rsquo;re changing.</p>
<p>Anti mask, but not really, but kind of.</p>
<p>So those two groups that feel political in nature,</p>
<p>not scientific in nature, they&rsquo;re bickering.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s clear that this data is being interpreted</p>
<p>by the different groups differently.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very difficult for me as a human being</p>
<p>to understand where the truth lies,</p>
<p>especially given how much money is flying around</p>
<p>on all sides.</p>
<p>So the anti vaxxers can make a lot of money too.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget this.</p>
<p>From the individual perspective,</p>
<p>you can become famous being an anti vaxxer.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a lot of incentives on all sides here.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s real human emotion and fear</p>
<p>and also credibility.</p>
<p>Scientists don&rsquo;t wanna ruin their reputation</p>
<p>if they speak out in whatever, like speak their opinion</p>
<p>or they look at some slice of the data</p>
<p>and begin to interpret it in some kind of way.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very, it&rsquo;s clear that fear is dominating</p>
<p>the discourse here, especially in the scientific community.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know what to make of that.</p>
<p>And the only happy people here is Pfizer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just plowing all ahead.</p>
<p>I mean, with every single variant,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s very, I would say, outside of arguably</p>
<p>a very flawed system, there&rsquo;s a lot of incredible</p>
<p>scientific and engineering work being done</p>
<p>in constantly developing new, like antiviral drugs,</p>
<p>new vaccines to deal with the variants.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re happily being a capitalist machine.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very difficult to know what to do with that.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s just put this in perspective for folks.</p>
<p>The best selling drug in the world has been Humira</p>
<p>for a number of years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis</p>
<p>and eight other indications.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sold about $20 billion globally</p>
<p>over the past few years.</p>
<p>It peaked at that level.</p>
<p>Pfizer expects to sell $65 billion of vaccine</p>
<p>in the first two years of the pandemic.</p>
<p>So this is by far the biggest selling</p>
<p>and most profitable drug that&rsquo;s ever come along.</p>
<p>I can ask you a difficult question here.</p>
<p>In the fog that we&rsquo;re operating in here,</p>
<p>on the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine,</p>
<p>what was done well and what was done badly</p>
<p>that you can see now, it seems like we&rsquo;ll know</p>
<p>more decades from now.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But now in the fog of today with the $65 billion</p>
<p>flying around, where do you land?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna get to what I think is one of the key problems</p>
<p>with the pharmaceutical industry model in the United States</p>
<p>about being profit driven.</p>
<p>So in 2016, the NIH did the key infrastructure work</p>
<p>to make mRNA vaccines.</p>
<p>That gets left out of the discussion a lot.</p>
<p>And Pfizer BioNTech actually paid royalties voluntarily</p>
<p>to the NIH.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much it was.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it was a whole lot of money,</p>
<p>but I think they wanted to avoid the litigation</p>
<p>that Moderna got itself into by just taking that 2016</p>
<p>knowledge and having that be the foundation</p>
<p>of their product.</p>
<p>So Pfizer took that and they did their R&amp;D,</p>
<p>they paid for their R&amp;D having received that technology.</p>
<p>And when they got the genetic code from China</p>
<p>about the virus, they very quickly made a vaccine</p>
<p>and the vaccine works.</p>
<p>And President Trump to his credit launched</p>
<p>Operation Warp Speed and just threw money at the problem.</p>
<p>They just said, we spent five times more per person</p>
<p>than the EU early on, just pay them whatever they want.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just get this going.</p>
<p>And Americans were vaccinated more quickly.</p>
<p>We paid a lot of money.</p>
<p>The one mistake that I think the federal government made</p>
<p>was they were paying these guaranteed fortunes</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t require that the companies participate</p>
<p>in a program to do global vaccinations.</p>
<p>So the companies doing their business model</p>
<p>distributed the vaccines where they would make</p>
<p>the most money.</p>
<p>And obviously they would make the most money</p>
<p>in the first world.</p>
<p>And almost I think 85% of the vaccines early on</p>
<p>went to the first world and very, very few vaccinations</p>
<p>went to the third world.</p>
<p>So what happened is there was such a low vaccination rate</p>
<p>in May of 2021, there was all hands on deck cry for help</p>
<p>from the World Trade Organization,</p>
<p>the World Health Organization, the IMF and the World Bank</p>
<p>made a plea for $50 billion so that we could get</p>
<p>to 40% vaccination rate in the third world</p>
<p>by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>And it was unrequited, nobody answered.</p>
<p>And now Africa has about a 8.9% vaccination rate.</p>
<p>India is coming up, but it&rsquo;s been very low.</p>
<p>The problem with all this is I believe those mRNA vaccines</p>
<p>are excellent vaccines.</p>
<p>But if we leave the third world unvaccinated,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have a constant supply of variants of COVID</p>
<p>that are gonna come back into the United States</p>
<p>and harm Americans exactly like Delta and Omicron have.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve made a great drug, it reduces the risk of mortality</p>
<p>in Americans who get it by a lot.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not doing what we need to do</p>
<p>to protect Americans from Omicron.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be an idealist</p>
<p>and worry about global vaccine equity.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re just ordinary selfish people like most of us are,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re worried about the health of Americans,</p>
<p>you would ensure global vaccine distribution.</p>
<p>Let me just make one more point.</p>
<p>That $50 billion that was requested</p>
<p>by the four organizations back in May of 2021,</p>
<p>32 billionaires made $50 billion</p>
<p>from the vaccines at that point,</p>
<p>took it into their private wealth.</p>
<p>So what had been taken,</p>
<p>this enormous amounts of money that had been taken</p>
<p>into private wealth was enough to do</p>
<p>what those organizations said needed to be done</p>
<p>to prevent the sub variants from coming back</p>
<p>and doing what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So the money was there, but how does the motivation,</p>
<p>the money driven motivation of Big Pharma lead to that,</p>
<p>that kind of allocation of vaccines?</p>
<p>Because they can make more money in the United States.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna distribute their vaccines</p>
<p>where they can make the most money.</p>
<p>Right, is there a malevolent aspect to this</p>
<p>where, boy, I don&rsquo;t like saying this,</p>
<p>but that they don&rsquo;t see it as a huge problem</p>
<p>that variants will come back to the United States.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the issue we were talking about earlier on</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re in a different culture</p>
<p>and their culture is that their moral obligation,</p>
<p>as Milton Friedman would say,</p>
<p>is to maximize the profits</p>
<p>that they return to shareholders.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t think about the bigger picture.</p>
<p>The collateral damage, don&rsquo;t think about the collateral.</p>
<p>And also kind of believe, convince yourself</p>
<p>that if we give into this capitalist machine</p>
<p>in this very narrow sense of capitalism,</p>
<p>that in the end, they&rsquo;ll do the most good.</p>
<p>This kind of belief that like,</p>
<p>if we just maximize profits, we&rsquo;ll do the most good.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s an orthodoxy of several decades ago.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think people can really say that in good faith.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re talking about vaccinating the third world</p>
<p>so we don&rsquo;t get hurt,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit hard to make the argument</p>
<p>that the world&rsquo;s a better place</p>
<p>because the profits of the investors went up.</p>
<p>Yeah, but at the same time,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a belief you can hold.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve interacted with a bunch of folks that kinda,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the, I don&rsquo;t wanna mischaracterize Ayn Rand, okay?</p>
<p>I respect a lot of people,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a belief that can take hold.</p>
<p>If I just focus on this particular maximization,</p>
<p>it will do the most good for the world.</p>
<p>The problem is when you choose what to maximize</p>
<p>and you put blinders on,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too easy to start making gigantic mistakes</p>
<p>that have a big negative impact on society.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really matters what you&rsquo;re maximizing.</p>
<p>Right, and if we had a true democracy</p>
<p>and everybody had one vote,</p>
<p>everybody got decent information and had one vote,</p>
<p>Ayn Rand&rsquo;s position would get some votes, but not many,</p>
<p>and it would be way outvoted by the common people.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about this very difficult topic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking to Mark Zuckerberg of Metta,</p>
<p>the topic of censorship.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve heard,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a guy named Robert Malone and Peter McCullough</p>
<p>that were removed from many platforms</p>
<p>for speaking about the COVID vaccine as being risky.</p>
<p>They were both on Joe Rogan&rsquo;s program.</p>
<p>What do you think about censorship in this space?</p>
<p>In this difficult space where so much is controlled by,</p>
<p>not controlled, but influenced by advertisements</p>
<p>from Big Pharma,</p>
<p>and science can even be influenced by Big Pharma.</p>
<p>Where do you lean on this?</p>
<p>Should we lean towards freedom</p>
<p>and just allow all the voices,</p>
<p>even those that go against the scientific consensus?</p>
<p>Is that one way to fight the science</p>
<p>that is funded by Big Pharma,</p>
<p>or is that do more harm than good,</p>
<p>having too many voices that are contending here?</p>
<p>Should the ultimate battle be fought</p>
<p>in the space of scientific publications?</p>
<p>And particularly in the era of COVID,</p>
<p>where there are large public health ramifications</p>
<p>to this public discourse, the ante is way up.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t have a simple answer to that.</p>
<p>I think everyone&rsquo;s allowed their own opinion.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think everyone&rsquo;s allowed their own scientific facts.</p>
<p>And how we develop a mechanism</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s other than an open internet</p>
<p>where whoever is shouting the loudest gets the most clicks</p>
<p>and rage creates value on the internet,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s not a good mechanism for working this out.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think we have one.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a solution to this.</p>
<p>I mean, ideally, if we had a philosopher king,</p>
<p>we could have a panel of people</p>
<p>who were not conflicted by rigid opinions</p>
<p>decide on what the boundaries of public discourse might be.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it should be fully open.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think people who are making,</p>
<p>who are committed to an anti vaccine position</p>
<p>and will tailor their interpretation</p>
<p>of complex scientific data to support their opinion,</p>
<p>I think that can be harmful.</p>
<p>Constraining their speech can be harmful as well.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t have an answer here.</p>
<p>But yeah.</p>
<p>I tend to believe that it&rsquo;s more dangerous</p>
<p>to censor anti vax messages.</p>
<p>The way to defeat anti vax messages</p>
<p>is by being great communicators,</p>
<p>by being great scientific communicators.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that we need to censor</p>
<p>the things we don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>We need to be better at communicating</p>
<p>the things we do like,</p>
<p>or the things that we do believe represent</p>
<p>the deep scientific truth.</p>
<p>Because I think if you censor,</p>
<p>you get worse at doing science</p>
<p>and you give the wrong people power.</p>
<p>So I tend to believe that you should give power</p>
<p>to the individual scientists</p>
<p>and also give them the responsibility</p>
<p>of being better educators, communicators,</p>
<p>expressers of scientific ideas,</p>
<p>put pressure on them to release data,</p>
<p>to release that data in a way that&rsquo;s easily consumable,</p>
<p>not just like very difficult to understand,</p>
<p>but in a way that can be understood</p>
<p>by a large number of people.</p>
<p>So the battle should be fought</p>
<p>in the open space of ideas</p>
<p>versus in the quiet space of journals.</p>
<p>I think we no longer have that comfort,</p>
<p>especially at the highest of stakes.</p>
<p>So this kind of idea that a couple of peer reviewers</p>
<p>decide the fate of billions</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem to be sustainable,</p>
<p>especially given a very real observation now</p>
<p>that the reason Robert Malone has a large following</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s a deep distrust of institutions,</p>
<p>deep distrust of scientists,</p>
<p>of science as an institution,</p>
<p>of power centers, of companies, of everything,</p>
<p>and perhaps rightfully so.</p>
<p>But the way to defend against that</p>
<p>is not for the powerful to build a bigger wall.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for the powerful to be authentic</p>
<p>and maybe a lot of them to get fired,</p>
<p>and for new minds, for new fresh scientists,</p>
<p>ones who are more authentic, more real,</p>
<p>better communicators to step up.</p>
<p>So I fear censorship</p>
<p>because it feels like censorship</p>
<p>is an even harder job to do it well</p>
<p>than being good communicators.</p>
<p>And it seems like it&rsquo;s always the C students</p>
<p>that end up doing the censorship.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always the incompetent people,</p>
<p>and not just the incompetent, but the biggest whiners.</p>
<p>So what happens is the people</p>
<p>that get the most emotional and the most outraged</p>
<p>will drive the censorship.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t seem like reason drives the censorship.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just objectively observing</p>
<p>how censorship seems to work in this current.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s so many forms of censorship.</p>
<p>You look at the Soviet Union</p>
<p>or the propaganda or Nazi Germany,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very different level of censorship.</p>
<p>People tend to conflate all of these things together.</p>
<p>Social media trying desperately to have trillions</p>
<p>or hundreds of billions of exchanges a day,</p>
<p>and try to make sure that their platform</p>
<p>has some semblance of, quote, healthy conversations.</p>
<p>People just don&rsquo;t go insane.</p>
<p>They actually like using the platform,</p>
<p>and they censor based on that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a different level of censorship.</p>
<p>But even there, you can really run afoul</p>
<p>of the people that get the whiny C students</p>
<p>controlling too much of the censorship.</p>
<p>I believe you should actually put the responsibility</p>
<p>on the self proclaimed holders of truth,</p>
<p>AKA scientists, at being better communicators.</p>
<p>I agree with that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not advocating for any kind of censorship.</p>
<p>But Marshall McLuhan was very influential</p>
<p>when I was in college.</p>
<p>And his, that meme, the medium is the message.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit hard to understand</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re comparing radio to TV</p>
<p>and saying radio&rsquo;s hotter or TV&rsquo;s hotter or something.</p>
<p>But we now have the medium as the message</p>
<p>in a way that we&rsquo;ve never seen,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve never imagined before,</p>
<p>where rage and anger and polarization</p>
<p>are what drives the traffic on the internet.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s a question of building the commons.</p>
<p>Ideally, I don&rsquo;t know how to get there,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not pretending to have a solution.</p>
<p>But the commons of discourse about this particular issue,</p>
<p>about vaccines, has been largely destroyed by the edges,</p>
<p>by the drug companies and the advocates on the one side</p>
<p>and the people who just criticize and think</p>
<p>that even though the data are flawed</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no way vaccines can be beneficial.</p>
<p>And to have those people screaming at each other</p>
<p>does nothing to improve the health</p>
<p>of the 95% of the people in the middle</p>
<p>who want to know what the rational way to go forward is</p>
<p>and protect their families from COVID</p>
<p>and live a good life</p>
<p>and be able to participate in the economy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a solution.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a difficult problem for Spotify and YouTube.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you heard,</p>
<p>this is a thing that Joe Rogan is currently going through.</p>
<p>As a platform, whether to censor the conversation</p>
<p>that, for example, Joe&rsquo;s having.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if you heard,</p>
<p>but Neil Young and other musicians have kind of spoke out</p>
<p>and saying they&rsquo;re going to leave the platform</p>
<p>because Joe Rogan is allowed to be on this platform</p>
<p>having these kinds of conversations</p>
<p>with the likes of Robert Malone.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s clear to me that Spotify and YouTube</p>
<p>are being significantly influenced</p>
<p>by these extreme voices, like you mentioned, on each side.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also clear to me that Facebook is the same</p>
<p>and it was going back and forth.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s why Facebook has been oscillating</p>
<p>on the censorship is like one group gets louder</p>
<p>than the other, depending on whether it&rsquo;s an election year.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s several things to say here.</p>
<p>So one, it does seem, I think you put it really well,</p>
<p>it would be amazing if these platforms</p>
<p>could find mechanisms to listen to the center,</p>
<p>to the big center that&rsquo;s actually going to be affected</p>
<p>by the results of our pursuit of scientific truth.</p>
<p>And listen to those voices.</p>
<p>I also believe that most people are intelligent enough</p>
<p>to process information and to make up their own minds.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re not, in terms of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s complicated, of course,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve just been talking about advertisement</p>
<p>and how people can be influenced.</p>
<p>But I feel like if you have raw, long form podcasts</p>
<p>or programs where people express their mind</p>
<p>and express their argument in full,</p>
<p>I think people can hear it to make up their own mind.</p>
<p>And if those arguments have a platform on which</p>
<p>they can live, then other people could provide</p>
<p>better arguments if they disagree with it.</p>
<p>And now we as human beings, as rational,</p>
<p>as intelligent human beings, can look at both</p>
<p>and make up our own minds.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where social media can be very good</p>
<p>at this collective intelligence.</p>
<p>We together listen to all of these voices</p>
<p>and make up our own mind.</p>
<p>Humble ourselves, actually, often.</p>
<p>You think, you know, like you&rsquo;re an expert,</p>
<p>say you have a PhD in a certain thing,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s this confidence that comes with that.</p>
<p>And the collective intelligence, uncensored,</p>
<p>allows you to humble yourself eventually.</p>
<p>Like as you discover, all it takes is a few times,</p>
<p>you know, looking back five years later,</p>
<p>realizing I was wrong.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really healthy for a scientist.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really healthy for anybody to go through.</p>
<p>And only through having that open discourse</p>
<p>can you really have that.</p>
<p>That said, Spotify also, just like Pfizer is a company,</p>
<p>which is why this podcast,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know what RSS feeds are,</p>
<p>but podcasts can&rsquo;t be censored.</p>
<p>So Joe&rsquo;s in the unfortunate position</p>
<p>he only lives on Spotify.</p>
<p>So Spotify has been actually very good</p>
<p>at saying we&rsquo;re staying out of it for now.</p>
<p>But RSS, this is pirate radio.</p>
<p>Nobody can censor it, it&rsquo;s the internet.</p>
<p>So financially, in terms of platforms,</p>
<p>this cannot be censored,</p>
<p>which is why podcasts are really beautiful.</p>
<p>And so if Spotify or YouTube wants to be</p>
<p>the host of podcasts,</p>
<p>I think where they flourish is free expression,</p>
<p>no matter how crazy.</p>
<p>Yes, but I do wanna push back a little bit on what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>I have anti fax friends who I love.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re dear, cherished friends.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll send me stuff.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll take me an hour to go through what they sent</p>
<p>to see if it is credible.</p>
<p>And usually it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a random sample of the anti fax argument.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying I can disprove the anti fax argument.</p>
<p>But I am saying that it&rsquo;s almost like we were talking about</p>
<p>how medical science clinical trials,</p>
<p>the presentation of clinical trials to physicians</p>
<p>could be improved.</p>
<p>And the first thing we came up with</p>
<p>is to have pre publication transparency</p>
<p>in the peer review process.</p>
<p>So bad information, biased information doesn&rsquo;t get out</p>
<p>as if it&rsquo;s legitimate, and you can&rsquo;t put it back,</p>
<p>recapture it once it gets out.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s an element of that</p>
<p>in the arguments that are going on about vaccines.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re on both sides.</p>
<p>But I think the anti fax side puts out more units</p>
<p>of information claiming to show that the vaccines don&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And I guess in an ideal situation,</p>
<p>there would be real time fact checking by independent people,</p>
<p>not to censor it, but to just say that study was set up</p>
<p>to do this, and this is what the conclusions were.</p>
<p>So the way it was stated is on one side of this argument.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m arguing.</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m arguing is that this big network of humans</p>
<p>that we have, that is the collective intelligence,</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t do that real time if you allow it to,</p>
<p>if you encourage people to do it.</p>
<p>And the scientists, as opposed to, listen,</p>
<p>I interact with a lot of colleagues,</p>
<p>a lot of friends that are scientists,</p>
<p>they roll their eyes.</p>
<p>Their response is like, ugh.</p>
<p>Like they don&rsquo;t want to interact with this.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just not the right response.</p>
<p>When a huge number of people believe this,</p>
<p>it is your job as communicators to defend your ideas.</p>
<p>It is no longer the case that you go to a conference</p>
<p>and defend your ideas to two other nerds</p>
<p>that have been working on the same problem forever.</p>
<p>I mean, sure, you can do that,</p>
<p>but then you&rsquo;re rejecting the responsibility</p>
<p>you have explicitly or implicitly accepted</p>
<p>when you go into this field,</p>
<p>that you will defend the ideas of truth.</p>
<p>And the way to defend them is in the open battlefield</p>
<p>of ideas, and become a better communicator.</p>
<p>And I believe that when you have a lot,</p>
<p>you said you invested one or two hours</p>
<p>in this particular, but that&rsquo;s little ants interacting</p>
<p>at scale, I think that allows us to progress towards truth.</p>
<p>At least, you know, at least I hope so.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re an optimist.</p>
<p>I want to work with you a little bit on this.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say a person like Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>who, by the way, had me on his podcast and let me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an amazing conversation, I really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Well, thank you.</p>
<p>I did too.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t know Joe.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know much about his podcast.</p>
<p>He pushed back on Joe a bunch, which is great.</p>
<p>And he was a gentleman, and we had it out.</p>
<p>In fact, he put one clip, at one point,</p>
<p>he said something that was a little bit wrong,</p>
<p>and I corrected him.</p>
<p>And he had the guy who.</p>
<p>Jamie.</p>
<p>Jamie, he had Jamie check it,</p>
<p>and was very forthright in saying,</p>
<p>yeah, you know, John&rsquo;s got a right here.</p>
<p>We gotta modify this.</p>
<p>In any event, in any event.</p>
<p>You got him.</p>
<p>Well, I wasn&rsquo;t trying to get him,</p>
<p>I was just trying to. No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Totally, it was a beautiful exchange.</p>
<p>There was so much respect in the room,</p>
<p>pushing back and forth, it was great.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I respect him.</p>
<p>And I think when he has somebody on</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a dyed in the wool anti faxer,</p>
<p>the question is, how can you balance,</p>
<p>if it needs balance, in real time?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about afterwards.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking in real time.</p>
<p>Maybe you record, well, he does record it, obviously.</p>
<p>But maybe when there&rsquo;s a statement made</p>
<p>that is made as if it&rsquo;s fact based,</p>
<p>maybe that statement should be checked by</p>
<p>some folks who,</p>
<p>imaginary folks who are trustworthy.</p>
<p>And in real time, as that discussion</p>
<p>is being played on the podcast,</p>
<p>to show what independent experts say about that claim.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really interesting idea.</p>
<p>By the way, for some reason,</p>
<p>this idea popped into my head now.</p>
<p>I think real time is very difficult,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not difficult,</p>
<p>but it kind of ruins the conversation</p>
<p>because you want the idea to breathe.</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s very possible is before it&rsquo;s published,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the pre publication, before it&rsquo;s published,</p>
<p>you let a bunch of people review it,</p>
<p>and they can add their voices in post.</p>
<p>Before it&rsquo;s published, they can add arguments,</p>
<p>arguments against certain parts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very interesting to sort of,</p>
<p>as one podcast, publish addendums.</p>
<p>Publish the peer review together with the publication.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>I might actually do that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve been doing more debates</p>
<p>where at the same time have multiple people,</p>
<p>which has a different dynamic</p>
<p>because both people, I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really nice to have the time to pause</p>
<p>just by yourself to fact check,</p>
<p>to look at the study that was mentioned,</p>
<p>to understand what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>So the peer review process, to have a little bit of time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>I actually would, I&rsquo;d like to try that.</p>
<p>To agree with you on some point in terms of anti vax,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been fascinated by listening to arguments</p>
<p>from this community of folks that&rsquo;s been quite large</p>
<p>called the flat earthers,</p>
<p>the people that believe the earth is flat.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever listened to them</p>
<p>or read their arguments,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s fascinating how consistent</p>
<p>and convincing it all sounds</p>
<p>when you just kind of take it in.</p>
<p>Just like, just take it in like listening normally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all very logical.</p>
<p>Like if you don&rsquo;t think very,</p>
<p>well, no, so the thing is,</p>
<p>the reality is at the very basic human level</p>
<p>with our limited cognitive capabilities,</p>
<p>the earth is pretty flat when you go outside</p>
<p>and you look at flat.</p>
<p>So like when you use common sense reasoning,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very easy to play to that,</p>
<p>to convince you that the earth is flat.</p>
<p>Plus there&rsquo;s powerful organizations</p>
<p>that want to manipulate you and so on.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s the whole progress of science</p>
<p>and physics of the past,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s difficult to integrate into your thought process.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very true that the people</p>
<p>should listen to flat earthers</p>
<p>because it was very revealing to me</p>
<p>how easy it is to be convinced of basically anything</p>
<p>by charismatic arguments.</p>
<p>And if we&rsquo;re arguing about whether the earth is flat or not,</p>
<p>as long as we&rsquo;re not navigating airplanes</p>
<p>and doing other kinds of things,</p>
<p>trying to get satellites to do transmission,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that important what I believe.</p>
<p>But if we&rsquo;re arguing about how we approach</p>
<p>the worst public health crisis in,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re getting worse than the Spanish flu now.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the total global deaths</p>
<p>with Spanish flu were, but in the United States,</p>
<p>we certainly have more deaths than we had from Spanish flu.</p>
<p>Plus the economic pain and suffering.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, and the damage to the kids in school and so forth.</p>
<p>We got a problem and it&rsquo;s not going away, unfortunately.</p>
<p>So when we get a problem like that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just an interesting bar room conversation</p>
<p>about whether the earth is flat.</p>
<p>There are millions of lives involved.</p>
<p>Let me ask you yet another question,</p>
<p>an issue I raised with Pfizer CO, Albert Burla.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the question of revolving doors.</p>
<p>That there seems to be a revolving door</p>
<p>between Pfizer, FDA, and CDC.</p>
<p>People that have worked at the FDA,</p>
<p>now work at Pfizer, and vice versa,</p>
<p>including the CDC and so on.</p>
<p>What do you think about that?</p>
<p>So first of all, his response, once again,</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s rules, there&rsquo;s very strict rules,</p>
<p>and we follow them.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s a problem?</p>
<p>Hoo ha.</p>
<p>And also, maybe this is a good time to talk about</p>
<p>this Pfizer play by the rules.</p>
<p>One at a time?</p>
<p>One at a time.</p>
<p>Okay, and this isn&rsquo;t even about Pfizer,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an answer to the question.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this drug, Ajihelm,</p>
<p>that was approved by the FDA maybe six months ago.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a drug to prevent the progression</p>
<p>of low grade Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>The target for drug development for Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease</p>
<p>has been reducing the amyloid plaques in the brain,</p>
<p>which correlate with the progression of Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And Biogen showed that its drug, Ajihelm,</p>
<p>reduces amyloid plaques in the brain.</p>
<p>They did two clinical trials</p>
<p>to determine the clinical efficacy,</p>
<p>and they found that neither trial showed a meaningful benefit.</p>
<p>And in those two trials,</p>
<p>33% more people in the Ajihelm group</p>
<p>developed symptomatic brain swelling and bleeding</p>
<p>than people in the placebo group.</p>
<p>There was an advisory committee convened</p>
<p>to debate and determine how they felt</p>
<p>about the approvability of Ajihelm, given those facts.</p>
<p>And those facts aren&rsquo;t in dispute.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in Biogen slides, as well as FDA documents.</p>
<p>The advisory committee voted 10 against approval</p>
<p>and one abstain.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s essentially universal,</p>
<p>unanimous vote against approving Ajihelm.</p>
<p>Now, the advisory committees have been pretty much cleansed</p>
<p>of financial conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>So this advisory committee votes 10 no, one abstention,</p>
<p>and the FDA overrules the unanimous opinion</p>
<p>of its advisory committee and approves the drug.</p>
<p>Three of the members of the advisory committee resign.</p>
<p>They say, we&rsquo;re not gonna be part,</p>
<p>if the FDA is not gonna listen to a unanimous vote</p>
<p>against approving this drug,</p>
<p>which shows more harm than benefit, undisputed,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna participate in this.</p>
<p>And the argument against approval</p>
<p>is that the surrogate endpoint,</p>
<p>the reduction of amyloid, the progression of amyloid plaques</p>
<p>is known by the FDA not to be a valid clinical indicator.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t correlate, 27 studies have shown,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t correlate with clinical progression,</p>
<p>interrupting the amyloid plaques</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that your Alzheimer&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t get worse.</p>
<p>So it seems like it&rsquo;s a slam dunk</p>
<p>and the FDA made a mistake and they should do whatever</p>
<p>they do to protect their bureaucratic reputation.</p>
<p>So the head of the Bureau of the FDA,</p>
<p>the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research</p>
<p>that approves new drugs, who had spent 16 years</p>
<p>as an executive in the pharmaceutical industry,</p>
<p>issued a statement and said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What we should do in this situation</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;is to loosen the prohibition of financial ties of interest</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;with the drug companies,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;so we get less emotional responses.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said this, it&rsquo;s in print.</p>
<p>People are just too emotional about this.</p>
<p>People were just too emotional.</p>
<p>The 10 people who voted against it</p>
<p>and the no people who voted for it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all too emotional.</p>
<p>So this gets back,</p>
<p>this is a long answer to your short question.</p>
<p>I think this is a wonderful window</p>
<p>into the thinking of the FDA</p>
<p>that financial conflicts of interest don&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>in a situation when I think it&rsquo;s obvious</p>
<p>that they would matter.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s not a direct financial conflict of interest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kinda, like it&rsquo;s not, like Albert said, there&rsquo;s rules.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re not allowed</p>
<p>to have direct financial conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s indirect.</p>
<p>Right, but what I&rsquo;m saying is,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not denying what he said is true,</p>
<p>but the FDA, a high official in the FDA,</p>
<p>is saying that we need to allow conflicts of interest</p>
<p>in our advisory committee meetings.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And that, she wants to change the rules.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So Albert Borla would still be playing by the rules,</p>
<p>but it just shows how one side of the thinking here is.</p>
<p>But you think that&rsquo;s influenced by the fact</p>
<p>that there were pharmaceutical executives</p>
<p>working at the FDA and vice versa?</p>
<p>And they think that&rsquo;s a great idea.</p>
<p>Who gets to fix this?</p>
<p>Do you think it should be just banned?</p>
<p>Like if you worked.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, two separate questions.</p>
<p>One is should the officials at the FDA come from pharma</p>
<p>and vice versa?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one question.</p>
<p>And the other question is should advisory committee members</p>
<p>be allowed to have financial conflicts of interest?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I think, in my opinion, and people might say I&rsquo;m biased,</p>
<p>I think advisory committee people</p>
<p>should not have conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>I think their only interest ought to be the public interest.</p>
<p>And that was true from my understanding of the situation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the afterword in my book.</p>
<p>I spent some time studying it about Ajihelm.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a slam dunk that there ought to be</p>
<p>no conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>Now the head of CDER, Center for Drug Evaluation Research,</p>
<p>thinks that that&rsquo;s gonna give you a biased result</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t have company influence.</p>
<p>And that, I think, shows how biased their thinking is.</p>
<p>That not having company influence is a bias.</p>
<p>Let me try to load that in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to empathize with the belief</p>
<p>that companies should have a voice at the table.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, it&rsquo;s part of the game.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve convinced themselves</p>
<p>that this is how it should be played.</p>
<p>But they have a voice at the table.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve designed the studies.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s their voice.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole point.</p>
<p>They analyze the data.</p>
<p>I mean, what bigger voice do you deserve?</p>
<p>But I do also think, on the more challenging question,</p>
<p>I do think that there should be a ban.</p>
<p>If you work at a pharmaceutical company,</p>
<p>you should not be allowed to work</p>
<p>at any regulatory agency.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You should not.</p>
<p>I mean, that, going back and forth,</p>
<p>it just, even if it&rsquo;s 30 years later.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>And I have another nomination for a ban.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in this crazy situation</p>
<p>where Medicare is not allowed to negotiate</p>
<p>the price of drugs with the drug companies.</p>
<p>So the drug companies get a patent on a new drug.</p>
<p>Unlike every other developed country,</p>
<p>they can charge whatever they want</p>
<p>so they have a monopoly on a utility</p>
<p>because no one else can make the drug.</p>
<p>Charge whatever they want and Medicare has to pay for it.</p>
<p>And you say, how did we get in this crazy situation?</p>
<p>So how we got here is that in 2003,</p>
<p>when Medicare Part D was passed,</p>
<p>Billy Towson was head of the Ways and Means Committee</p>
<p>in the House, played a key role in ushering this through</p>
<p>with the nonnegotiation clause of it.</p>
<p>And after it was passed,</p>
<p>Billy Towson did not finish out his term in Congress.</p>
<p>He went to pharma for a $2 million a year job.</p>
<p>This is incredible.</p>
<p>You might think that a ban on that would be a good idea.</p>
<p>I spoke with Francis Collins, head of the NIH,</p>
<p>on this podcast.</p>
<p>He and NIH have a lot of power over funding in science.</p>
<p>What are they doing right, what are they doing wrong</p>
<p>in this interplay with big pharma?</p>
<p>How connected are they?</p>
<p>Again, returning to the question,</p>
<p>what are they doing right,</p>
<p>what are they doing wrong in your view?</p>
<p>So my knowledge of the NIH is not as granular</p>
<p>as my knowledge of pharma.</p>
<p>That said, in broad brushstrokes,</p>
<p>the NIH is doing the infrastructure work</p>
<p>for all drug development.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;ve participated in 100% of the drugs</p>
<p>that have been approved by the FDA</p>
<p>over the past 10 years or so.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve done infrastructure work.</p>
<p>And what they do is not work on particular drugs,</p>
<p>but they develop work on drug targets,</p>
<p>on targets in the human body that can be affected by drugs</p>
<p>and might be beneficial to turn on or off.</p>
<p>And then the drug companies, when they find a target</p>
<p>that is mutable and potentially beneficial,</p>
<p>then the drug companies can take the research</p>
<p>and choose to invest in the development of the drugs,</p>
<p>specific drug.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our model.</p>
<p>Now, 96% of the research that&rsquo;s done in clinical trials</p>
<p>in the United States is about drugs and devices.</p>
<p>And only a fraction of the 4% that&rsquo;s left over</p>
<p>is about preventive medicine</p>
<p>and how to make Americans healthier.</p>
<p>I think, again, from the satellite view,</p>
<p>the NIH is investing more in science</p>
<p>that can lead to commercial development</p>
<p>rather than, as you said at the beginning of the podcast,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no big fitness and lifestyle industry</p>
<p>that can counter pharma.</p>
<p>So I think at the NIH level, that countering can be done.</p>
<p>And the diabetes prevention program study</p>
<p>that we talked about before where lifestyle</p>
<p>was part of a randomized trial</p>
<p>and was shown to be more effective than metformin</p>
<p>at preventing the development of diabetes,</p>
<p>that is absolute proof positive</p>
<p>that investing in that kind of science</p>
<p>can produce good results.</p>
<p>So I think that we&rsquo;re aimed at drug development</p>
<p>and what we ought to be aimed at</p>
<p>is an epidemiological approach</p>
<p>to improving the health of all Americans.</p>
<p>We rank 68th in the world in healthy life expectancy</p>
<p>despite spending an extra trillion and a half dollars a year.</p>
<p>And I believe strongly</p>
<p>that the reason why we&rsquo;ve gotten in this crazy position</p>
<p>is because the knowledge that we&rsquo;re producing</p>
<p>is about new drugs and devices</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not about improving population health.</p>
<p>In this problem, the NIH is the perfect institution</p>
<p>to play a role in rebalancing our research agenda.</p>
<p>And some of that is on the leadership side</p>
<p>with Francis Collins and Anthony Fauci,</p>
<p>not just speaking about basically everything</p>
<p>that just leads to drug development, vaccine development,</p>
<p>but also speaking about healthy lifestyles</p>
<p>and speaking about health, not just sickness.</p>
<p>Yes, and investing, investing in health.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like one feeds the other.</p>
<p>One, you have to communicate to the public</p>
<p>the importance of investing in health</p>
<p>and that leads to you getting props for investing in health</p>
<p>and then you can invest in health more and more</p>
<p>and that communicates, I mean,</p>
<p>everything that Anthony Fauci says or Francis Collins says</p>
<p>has an impact on scientists.</p>
<p>I mean, it sets the priorities.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they, it&rsquo;s the sad thing about leaders,</p>
<p>forgive me for saying the word, but mediocre leaders</p>
<p>is they don&rsquo;t see themselves as part of a game.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t see the momentum.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a fish in the water.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t see the water.</p>
<p>Great leaders stand up and reverse the direction</p>
<p>of how things are going.</p>
<p>And I actually put a lot of responsibility,</p>
<p>some people say too much, but whatever.</p>
<p>I think leaders carry the responsibility.</p>
<p>I put a lot of responsibility on Anthony Fauci</p>
<p>and Francis Collins for not actually speaking</p>
<p>a lot more about health, not, and bigger,</p>
<p>inspiring people in the power</p>
<p>and the trustworthiness of science.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s on the shoulders of Anthony Fauci.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna abstain from that</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not expert enough, but.</p>
<p>Neither am I, but I&rsquo;m opinionated.</p>
<p>I am too, but not on camera.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>No, but seriously, the problem is pretty simple,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re investing 96% of our funding</p>
<p>of clinical research in drugs and devices</p>
<p>and 80% of our health is determined</p>
<p>by how we live our lives.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And this is ridiculous.</p>
<p>The United States is going further and further</p>
<p>behind the other wealthy countries in terms of our health.</p>
<p>We ranked 38th in healthy life expectancy in 2000</p>
<p>and now we&rsquo;re spending a trillion and a half dollars extra</p>
<p>and we rank 68th.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gone down.</p>
<p>You have this excellent, there&rsquo;s a few charts</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll overlay that tell this story</p>
<p>in really powerful ways.</p>
<p>So one is the healthcare spending is percentage of GDP</p>
<p>that on the X axis is years and the Y axis is percentage</p>
<p>and the United States as compared to other countries</p>
<p>on average has been much larger and growing.</p>
<p>Right, we are now spending 7% more of our GDP,</p>
<p>17.7% versus 10.7% on healthcare.</p>
<p>7% and I think GDP is the fairest way</p>
<p>to compare healthcare spending.</p>
<p>Where per person in dollars we&rsquo;re spending even,</p>
<p>the difference is even greater</p>
<p>but other costs vary with GDP.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s stick with the conservative way to do it.</p>
<p>17.7 or 18% of GDP, 18% of GDP spent on healthcare,</p>
<p>7% higher than the comparable country average.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>17.7% versus 10.7, 7% higher.</p>
<p>Right and 7% of $23 trillion GDP</p>
<p>is more than $1.5 trillion a year in excess.</p>
<p>And then you have another chart that shows</p>
<p>healthcare system performance compared to spending.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a cloud, a point cloud of different countries.</p>
<p>The X axis being healthcare spending</p>
<p>is a percentage of GDP which we just talked about.</p>
<p>That US is 7% higher than everyone, the average.</p>
<p>And then on the Y axis is performance.</p>
<p>So X axis spending, Y axis performance.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a point cloud, we&rsquo;ll overlay this</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re watching on YouTube,</p>
<p>of a bunch of countries that have high performance</p>
<p>for what they&rsquo;re spending and then US</p>
<p>is all alone on the right bottom side of the chart</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s low performance and high spending.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>So this is a system that is abiding by spending</p>
<p>that is directed by the most profitable ways</p>
<p>to deliver healthcare.</p>
<p>So you put that in the hands of big pharma.</p>
<p>As you maximize for profit, you&rsquo;re going to decrease</p>
<p>performance and increase spending.</p>
<p>Yes, but I wanna qualify that and say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not all big pharma&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not responsible for all the problems</p>
<p>in our healthcare system.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not responsible for the administrative costs</p>
<p>for example.</p>
<p>But they are the largest component of the rising,</p>
<p>our rising healthcare costs.</p>
<p>And it has to do with this knowledge issue.</p>
<p>Controlling the knowledge that doctors have</p>
<p>makes it so that doctors can live with this situation</p>
<p>believing that it&rsquo;s optimal when it&rsquo;s a wreck.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let me ask you the big, so as a physician,</p>
<p>so everything you&rsquo;ve seen, we&rsquo;ve talked about 80%</p>
<p>of the impact on health is lifestyle.</p>
<p>How do we live longer?</p>
<p>What advice would you give to general people?</p>
<p>What space of ideas result in living longer</p>
<p>and higher quality lives?</p>
<p>Right, this is a very simple question to answer.</p>
<p>Exercise for at least a half hour</p>
<p>at least five times a week.</p>
<p>Number one.</p>
<p>Number two, don&rsquo;t smoke.</p>
<p>Number three, maintain a reasonably healthy body weight.</p>
<p>Some people argue that being lower than a BMI of 25</p>
<p>is healthy.</p>
<p>I think that may be true,</p>
<p>but I think getting above 30 is unhealthy</p>
<p>and that ought to be.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s largely impacted by socioeconomic status</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t wanna blame the victims here.</p>
<p>So we gotta understand that when we talk about</p>
<p>all of these things, not cigarettes,</p>
<p>but exercise and a good diet</p>
<p>and maintaining a healthy body weight,</p>
<p>we have to include in doing those things</p>
<p>the impediments to people of lower socioeconomic status</p>
<p>being able to make those changes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got to understand that personal responsibility</p>
<p>accounts for some of this,</p>
<p>but also social circumstances accounts for some of it.</p>
<p>And back to your fish bowl analogy,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re swimming in a fish bowl,</p>
<p>if you live in a fish tank</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not being properly maintained,</p>
<p>the approach wouldn&rsquo;t be to treat individual sick fish,</p>
<p>it would be to fix your fish tank</p>
<p>to get the bacteria out of it</p>
<p>and whatever bad stuff is in there</p>
<p>and make your fish tank healthier.</p>
<p>Well, we invest far less than the other wealthy countries do.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re flipped, we have the mirror image</p>
<p>in the spending on social determinants of health</p>
<p>and medical determinants of health.</p>
<p>We have exactly the wrong order.</p>
<p>And not only does that choke off</p>
<p>social determinants of health, which are very important,</p>
<p>but actually just the ratio,</p>
<p>even if you were spending,</p>
<p>if we raise the social spending</p>
<p>and raise our medical spending in proportion,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the ratio of social spending to medical spending</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>So, and why do we do that?</p>
<p>Well, the answer is perfectly obvious</p>
<p>that the way to transfer money</p>
<p>from working Americans to investors</p>
<p>is through the biomedical model,</p>
<p>not through the social health model.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the problem for,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d like to discuss this</p>
<p>because the market isn&rsquo;t gonna get us</p>
<p>to a reasonable allocation.</p>
<p>All the other wealthy countries</p>
<p>that are so much healthier than we are</p>
<p>and spending so much less than we are</p>
<p>have some form of government intervention</p>
<p>in the quality of the health data that&rsquo;s available,</p>
<p>in the budgeting of health and social factors.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;re kind of the Wild West</p>
<p>and we let the market determine those allocations.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an awful failure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a horrendous failure.</p>
<p>So one argument against government,</p>
<p>or sorry, an alternative to the government intervention</p>
<p>is the market can work better</p>
<p>if the citizenry has better information.</p>
<p>So one argument is that</p>
<p>communicators like podcasts and so on,</p>
<p>but other channels of communication</p>
<p>will be the way to fight big pharma.</p>
<p>Your book is the way to,</p>
<p>by providing information.</p>
<p>The alternative to the government intervention</p>
<p>on every aspect of this,</p>
<p>including communication with the doctors</p>
<p>is to provide them other information</p>
<p>and not allow the market to provide that information</p>
<p>by basically making it exciting</p>
<p>to buy books, to make better and better communicators</p>
<p>on Twitter, through books, through op eds,</p>
<p>through podcasts, through so on.</p>
<p>So basically, cause there&rsquo;s a lot of incentive</p>
<p>to communicate against the messages of big pharma.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s incentive because people want to understand</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s good for their lives</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re willing to listen to charismatic people</p>
<p>that are able to clearly explain what is good for them.</p>
<p>And they do, and more than 80% of people</p>
<p>think that drugs cost too much</p>
<p>and the drug industry is too interested in profits.</p>
<p>But they still get influenced.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t, you can&rsquo;t get the vote through Congress.</p>
<p>You know, Democrats and Republicans alike</p>
<p>are taking money from Congress</p>
<p>and somehow it just doesn&rsquo;t work out</p>
<p>that these even small changes.</p>
<p>I mean, the pared down part of Medicare,</p>
<p>the plan for increasing Medicare negotiation drug costs</p>
<p>in Build Back Better,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s literally gonna reduce the number of new drugs</p>
<p>that are beneficial, uniquely beneficial</p>
<p>by about one new drug or two new drugs over 30 years.</p>
<p>It will have virtually an indecipherable impact.</p>
<p>And yet pharma is talking about the impact on innovation.</p>
<p>And if you vote for this,</p>
<p>if you let your Congressman vote for this,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna severely slow down drug innovation</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s gonna affect the quality of your life.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about over medication</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been talking about from different angles.</p>
<p>But one difficult question for me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just, I&rsquo;ll pick one of the difficult topics,</p>
<p>depression.</p>
<p>So depression is a serious, painful condition</p>
<p>that leads to a lot of people suffering in the world.</p>
<p>And yet it is likely they were over prescribing</p>
<p>antidepressants.</p>
<p>So as a doctor, as a patient, as a healthcare system,</p>
<p>as a society, what do we do with that fact</p>
<p>that people suffer?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people suffering from depression</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s also people suffering</p>
<p>from over prescribing of antidepressants.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So a paper in the New England Journal by Eric Turner</p>
<p>showed that the data,</p>
<p>if you put all the data together from antidepressants,</p>
<p>you find out that antidepressants are not effective</p>
<p>for people who are depressed</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t have a major depression.</p>
<p>Major depression is a serious problem.</p>
<p>People can&rsquo;t function normally.</p>
<p>They have a hard time getting out,</p>
<p>performing their normal social roles.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s happened is that the publicity,</p>
<p>I mean, Prozac Nation was a good example</p>
<p>of making the argument that why should people</p>
<p>settle for normal happiness</p>
<p>when they can have better than normal happiness?</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re not having normal happiness,</p>
<p>you should take a drug.</p>
<p>Well, that concept that serotonin metabolism</p>
<p>is the root cause of depression</p>
<p>is really a destructive one.</p>
<p>We have drugs that change serotonin metabolism</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s why antidepressants</p>
<p>work on major depression.</p>
<p>And they certainly don&rsquo;t work on everybody</p>
<p>with major depression.</p>
<p>I forget what the number needed a treat is.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s around four,</p>
<p>one out of four people have significant improvement.</p>
<p>But the people without major depression don&rsquo;t get better.</p>
<p>And the vast majority of these drugs</p>
<p>are used for people without major depression.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s happened is that the feelings</p>
<p>of life satisfaction of happiness and not sadness</p>
<p>have been medicalized.</p>
<p>The normal range of feelings have been medicalized.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not to say that they shouldn&rsquo;t be attended to.</p>
<p>But the evidence shows that attending to them</p>
<p>by giving somebody a medicine doesn&rsquo;t help</p>
<p>except that they feel like somebody cares about them</p>
<p>and believes that they&rsquo;re suffering.</p>
<p>But there are problems in living</p>
<p>that give rise to much of this symptomatology</p>
<p>of less than major depression.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s call it what it is</p>
<p>and figure out a way to help people</p>
<p>in visual therapy, group therapy.</p>
<p>Maybe lifestyle modification would work.</p>
<p>We gotta try that.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s call it what it is instead of saying,</p>
<p>oh, you&rsquo;re in this vast basket of people who are depressed</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ll give you an antidepressant</p>
<p>even though the evidence shows</p>
<p>that people who are suffering from your level of depression</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get better.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a consequence of not focusing</p>
<p>on preventative medicine, the lifestyle changes,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Well, yes, but it&rsquo;s really a consequence</p>
<p>of the drug companies creating the impression</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;re sad, take a pill.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re nonmajor depression,</p>
<p>how do you overcome depression?</p>
<p>Well, you have to talk about what the problem is.</p>
<p>So talk therapy, lifestyle changes.</p>
<p>Well, no, I&rsquo;m not jumping to that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying that you ought to,</p>
<p>A, the way you feel must be respected.</p>
<p>Yeah, acknowledge that you&rsquo;re suffering.</p>
<p>Acknowledge that you&rsquo;re suffering</p>
<p>and deal with healthcare providers</p>
<p>who acknowledge that you&rsquo;re suffering.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take that first step.</p>
<p>And then. Big first step also.</p>
<p>Big first step, yeah.</p>
<p>Family docs are pretty good at that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of the arena</p>
<p>that caused me to go into family medicine.</p>
<p>The subjective experience of the patient.</p>
<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;re a person</p>
<p>who is not getting the enjoyment out of their life</p>
<p>that they feel they ought to be getting.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s figure out why</p>
<p>and whether that means some time with a social worker,</p>
<p>some time with a psychiatrist,</p>
<p>some time with a psychiatric nurse.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how you&rsquo;d best do that</p>
<p>most effectively and efficiently,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what you need to do.</p>
<p>And it may be that there&rsquo;s a marital problem</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s something going on</p>
<p>and one of the spouses can&rsquo;t find satisfaction</p>
<p>in the life they have to live within their relationship.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s a past history of trauma or abuse</p>
<p>that somebody is projecting onto their current situation.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s socioeconomic circumstances</p>
<p>where they can&rsquo;t find a job</p>
<p>that gives them self respect and enough money to live.</p>
<p>All, you know, an infinite range of things.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s figure out, make a diagnosis first.</p>
<p>The diagnosis isn&rsquo;t that the person feels sadder</p>
<p>than they feel, than they want to feel.</p>
<p>The diagnosis is why does the person feel sadder</p>
<p>than they want to feel?</p>
<p>You mentioned this is what made you want</p>
<p>to get into family medicine.</p>
<p>As a doctor, what do you think about the saying,</p>
<p>save one life, save the world?</p>
<p>This was always moving to me about doctors</p>
<p>because you have like this human in front of you</p>
<p>and your time is worth money.</p>
<p>Your, what you prescribe and your efforts</p>
<p>after the visit are worth money.</p>
<p>And it seems like the task of the doctor</p>
<p>is to not think about any of that.</p>
<p>Or not the task, but it seems like a great doctor,</p>
<p>despite all that, just forgets it all</p>
<p>and just cares about the one human.</p>
<p>And somehow that feels like the love and effort</p>
<p>you put into helping one person</p>
<p>is the thing that will save the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like some economic argument</p>
<p>or some political argument or financial argument.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very human drive that ultimately</p>
<p>is behind all of this that will do good for the world.</p>
<p>Yes, I think that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And at the same time, I think it&rsquo;s equally true</p>
<p>that all physicians need to have a sense of responsibility</p>
<p>about how the common resources are allocated</p>
<p>to serve the whole population&rsquo;s interest best.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a tension that you have as a physician.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take the extreme example.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you had a patient in front of you</p>
<p>who if you gave one $10 billion pill to,</p>
<p>you would save their life.</p>
<p>I would just be tortured by that as a physician</p>
<p>because I know that $10 billion spent properly</p>
<p>in an epidemiologically guided way</p>
<p>is gonna save a whole lot more lives than one life.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s also your responsibility as a physician</p>
<p>to walk away from that patient.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s your responsibility</p>
<p>to be tortured by it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>The human condition.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a tough job, but yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>To maintain your humanity through it all.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you&rsquo;ve been asking at different points</p>
<p>in this conversation, why are doctors so complacent</p>
<p>about the tremendous amount of money we&rsquo;re spending?</p>
<p>Why do they accept knowledge from different sources</p>
<p>that may not pan out when they really know the truth?</p>
<p>And the answer is that they&rsquo;re trying to do their best</p>
<p>for their patients.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this, it&rsquo;s the same kind of torture</p>
<p>to figure out what the hell is going on with the data.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a sort of future project.</p>
<p>And maybe people will read my book</p>
<p>and maybe they&rsquo;ll get a little more excited about it,</p>
<p>become more legitimate in practice.</p>
<p>I would feel like my life was worthwhile if that happened.</p>
<p>But at the same time, they&rsquo;ve got to do something</p>
<p>with the patient in front of them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got to make a decision.</p>
<p>And they probably, there are not many weirdos like me</p>
<p>who invest their life in figuring out</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s behind the data.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to get through the day</p>
<p>and do the right thing for their patient.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re tortured by that decision too.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re not careful,</p>
<p>big pharma can manipulate that drive</p>
<p>to try to help the patient,</p>
<p>that humanity of dealing with the uncertainty of it all.</p>
<p>Like what is the best thing to do?</p>
<p>Big pharma can step in and use money</p>
<p>to manipulate that humanity.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would state it quite differently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of an opt out rather than an opt in.</p>
<p>Big pharma will do that.</p>
<p>And you need to opt out of it.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to a young person today</p>
<p>in high school or college</p>
<p>stepping into this complicated world</p>
<p>full of advertisements, of big powerful institutions,</p>
<p>of big rich companies,</p>
<p>how to have a positive impact in the world,</p>
<p>how to live a life they can be proud of?</p>
<p>I would say should that person</p>
<p>who has only good motives go into medicine.</p>
<p>They have an inclination to go into medicine</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve asked me what I think about that</p>
<p>given what I know about the undermining</p>
<p>of American healthcare at this point.</p>
<p>And my answer is if you&rsquo;ve got the calling,</p>
<p>you should do it.</p>
<p>You should do it because nobody&rsquo;s gonna do it</p>
<p>better than you.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t have the calling</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in it for the money,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna be proud of yourself.</p>
<p>How do you prevent yourself from doing,</p>
<p>from letting the system change you over years and years,</p>
<p>like letting the game of pharmaceutical influence affect you?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very hard question</p>
<p>because the sociologic norms are to be affected</p>
<p>and to trust the sources of information</p>
<p>that are largely controlled by the drug industry.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I wrote Sickening,</p>
<p>is to try and help those people in the medical profession</p>
<p>to understand that what&rsquo;s going on right now looks normal</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>The health of Americans is going downhill.</p>
<p>Our society&rsquo;s getting ruined by the money</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s getting pulled out of other socially beneficial uses</p>
<p>to pay for health care that is not helping us.</p>
<p>So fundamentally, the thing that is normal,</p>
<p>now question the normal, don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If you conform, conform hesitantly.</p>
<p>Well, you have to conform.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t become a doctor without conforming.</p>
<p>I just made it through.</p>
<p>But there aren&rsquo;t many and it&rsquo;s hard work.</p>
<p>But you have to conform.</p>
<p>And even with my colleagues in my own practice,</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t convince them that some of the beliefs they had</p>
<p>about how best to practice weren&rsquo;t accurate.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one scene, a younger physician</p>
<p>had prescribed hormone replacement therapy.</p>
<p>This is back in 2000, 2001.</p>
<p>Had prescribed hormone replacement therapy for one of my patients</p>
<p>who happened to be a really good personal friend.</p>
<p>And I saw that patient covering for my colleague at one point</p>
<p>and I saw that her hormone replacement therapy had been renewed.</p>
<p>And I said, are you having hot flashes or any problem?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>But Dr. So and So said it&rsquo;s better for my health.</p>
<p>And I said, no, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>The research is showing that it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s harmful for your health</p>
<p>and I think you should stop it.</p>
<p>So my colleague approached me when she saw the chart and said,</p>
<p>wait a minute, that&rsquo;s my patient.</p>
<p>Maybe your friend, but it&rsquo;s my patient.</p>
<p>And I went to a conference from my alma mater, medical school,</p>
<p>and they said that healthy people should be given hormone replacement.</p>
<p>And I said, there&rsquo;s got to be a way to get rid of it.</p>
<p>And I said, there&rsquo;s got to be drug companies involved in this.</p>
<p>And she said, no, no, no, it was at my university.</p>
<p>It was not a drug company thing.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t go to a Caribbean island.</p>
<p>I said, do you have the syllabus?</p>
<p>She said, yeah.</p>
<p>And she went and got the syllabus and sure enough,</p>
<p>it was sponsored by a drug company.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re everywhere.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s back to Kuhn that groups of experts</p>
<p>share unspoken assumptions, and in order to be included</p>
<p>in that group of experts, you have</p>
<p>to share those unspoken assumptions.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m hoping to do with my book, Sickening,</p>
<p>and being here having this wonderful conversation with you</p>
<p>is to create an alternative to this normal</p>
<p>that people can pursue and practice better medicine</p>
<p>and also prevent burnout.</p>
<p>I mean, about half the doctors complain that they&rsquo;re burned</p>
<p>out and they&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>And I think that this is subjective.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have data on this.</p>
<p>This is just my opinion.</p>
<p>But I think that a lot of that burnout</p>
<p>is so called moral injury from practicing in a way</p>
<p>that the docs know isn&rsquo;t working.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not actually providing an alternative to the normals,</p>
<p>expanding the normals, shifting the normal,</p>
<p>just like with Kuhn.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re basically looking to shift</p>
<p>the way medicine is done to the original,</p>
<p>to the intent that it represents the ideal of medicine,</p>
<p>of health care.</p>
<p>Yeah, in Kuhnian terms, to have a revolution.</p>
<p>And that revolution would be to practice medicine</p>
<p>in a way that will be epidemiologically most</p>
<p>effective, not most profitable for the people</p>
<p>who are providing you with what&rsquo;s called knowledge.</p>
<p>You helped a lot of people, as a doctor, as an educator,</p>
<p>live better lives, live longer.</p>
<p>But you yourself are a mortal being.</p>
<p>Do you think about your own mortality?</p>
<p>Do you think about your death?</p>
<p>Are you afraid of death?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve faced it, been close.</p>
<p>Yourself?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>How do you think about it?</p>
<p>What wisdom do you gain from having come close to death,</p>
<p>the fact that the whole thing ends?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s liberating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very liberating.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m serious.</p>
<p>I was close, and not too long ago.</p>
<p>And it was a sense of, this may be the way it ends.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve done my best.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not been perfect.</p>
<p>And if it ends here, it ends here.</p>
<p>The people around me are trying to do their best.</p>
<p>And in fact, I got pulled out of it.</p>
<p>But it didn&rsquo;t look like I was going to get pulled out of it.</p>
<p>Are you ultimately grateful for the ride, even though it ends?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a little odd.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>If I know you can&rsquo;t take the ride if you know it&rsquo;s going to end well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the real ride.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a ride.</p>
<p>But having gone through the whole thing,</p>
<p>I definitely freed me of a sense of anxiety about death.</p>
<p>And it said to me, do your best every day,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to end sometime.</p>
<p>I apologize for the ridiculously big question.</p>
<p>But what do you think is the meaning of life,</p>
<p>of our human existence?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s to care about something and do your best with it.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s being a doctor and trying</p>
<p>to make sure that the greatest number of people</p>
<p>get the best health care.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s a gardener who wants to have the most beautiful plants.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s a grandparent who wants to have a good relationship</p>
<p>with their grandchildren.</p>
<p>But whatever it is that gives you a sense of meaning,</p>
<p>as long as it doesn&rsquo;t hurt other people,</p>
<p>to really commit yourself to it.</p>
<p>That commitment, being in that commitment for me</p>
<p>is the meaning of life.</p>
<p>Put your whole heart and soul into the thing.</p>
<p>What is it, the Bukowski poem, go all the way.</p>
<p>John, you&rsquo;re an incredible human being, incredible educator.</p>
<p>Like I said, I recommend people listen to your lectures.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so refreshing to see that clarity</p>
<p>of thought and brilliance.</p>
<p>And obviously, your criticism of Big Pharma</p>
<p>or your illumination of the mechanisms of Big Pharma</p>
<p>is really important at this time.</p>
<p>So I really hope people read your book, Sickening,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s out today, or depending on when this comes out.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for spending your extremely valuable time</p>
<p>with me today.</p>
<p>It was amazing.</p>
<p>Well, Lex, I wanted back to you.</p>
<p>Thanks for engaging in this conversation,</p>
<p>for creating the space to have it,</p>
<p>and creating a listenership that is</p>
<p>interested in understanding serious ideas.</p>
<p>And I really appreciate the conversation.</p>
<p>And I should mention that offline,</p>
<p>you told me you listened to the Gilbert Strang episode.</p>
<p>So for anyone who don&rsquo;t know Gilbert Strang,</p>
<p>another epic human being that you should check out.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know anything about mathematics</p>
<p>or linear algebra, go look him up.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the great mathematics educators of all time.</p>
<p>So of all the people you mentioned to me,</p>
<p>I appreciate that you mentioned him,</p>
<p>because he is a rockstar of mathematics.</p>
<p>John, thank you so much for talking to us, it was awesome.</p>
<p>Great, thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with John Abramson.</p>
