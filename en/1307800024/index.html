    <p>Welcome to the History of English podcast, a podcast about the history of the English</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>This is episode 22, Early Germanic Grammar.</p>
<p>In this episode, we&rsquo;re going to continue our look at the earliest Germanic language.</p>
<p>Specifically, we&rsquo;re going to focus on the grammar of the early Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>But before I begin, let me thank all of you who&rsquo;ve purchased the History of the Alphabet</p>
<p>series.</p>
<p>That series is still available through iTunes and Amazon.com and my website, historyofenglishpodcast.com.</p>
<p>And I also want to thank all of you who&rsquo;ve sent me emails regarding the Alphabet series</p>
<p>or this podcast.</p>
<p>You can always reach me at Kevin at historyofenglishpodcast.com.</p>
<p>And I also want to thank all of you who&rsquo;ve left reviews and ratings on iTunes.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t mentioned that lately, but I appreciate the feedback from all of you who&rsquo;ve taken</p>
<p>the time to do that.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s turn our attention to this episode.</p>
<p>Now last time, we looked at some of the vocabulary of the early Germanic tribes at a time when</p>
<p>there was a common Germanic language, which was the ancestor of English and German and</p>
<p>the Scandinavian languages, among others.</p>
<p>But how did they use those words?</p>
<p>In other words, what was their grammar like?</p>
<p>Well, a good place to start is with the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>The Germanic languages evolved from that original Indo-European language, so the Germanic tribes</p>
<p>inherited their grammar from the first Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>And so you might consider going back and listening to Episode 8 of the podcast where I took a</p>
<p>look at the Indo-European grammar, because this episode will focus on how that original</p>
<p>language began to change in the hands and in the mouths of the early Germans.</p>
<p>And the key to understanding all of this is that concept of inflections, which I discussed</p>
<p>back in Episode 8.</p>
<p>The overall theme here is that the original Indo-European language had lots of those inflections,</p>
<p>but over the centuries, English has lost most of them, but not all of them.</p>
<p>And this process of losing inflections began with the early Germanic speakers.</p>
<p>And some of the basic changes within the early Germanic language is still reflected in modern</p>
<p>English.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s begin by reviewing the concept of inflections.</p>
<p>Inflections are basically changes or variations of a word to indicate something specific about</p>
<p>the word.</p>
<p>And the important thing to understand here is that language allows us to express basic</p>
<p>concepts and ideas, but it also allows us to express subtle variations in those concepts.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a basic sentence like, The horse jumps the fence.</p>
<p>The idea that&rsquo;s being conveyed is very simple.</p>
<p>But I can create subtle variations like, The horses jump the fences.</p>
<p>So instead of one horse and one fence, I&rsquo;m now referring to many horses and many fences.</p>
<p>Or how about this sentence, The horse jumped the fence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now expressing the same idea, but I put it in the past, so I&rsquo;m using past tense.</p>
<p>The point here is that language allows us to make very slight changes to words to alter</p>
<p>the meaning of the words.</p>
<p>So when I put an s or an es at the end of a noun, like horse or fence, that&rsquo;s my way</p>
<p>of telling you that there was more than one of them.</p>
<p>And that may seem incredibly obvious, but not all languages do that.</p>
<p>In Chinese, for example, the word for horse doesn&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>So if I want to indicate multiple horses, I have to insert an extra word to indicate</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>So I would say something like, Two horse jump the fence.</p>
<p>Or many horse jump the fence.</p>
<p>Or several horse jumps the fence.</p>
<p>But in English, I don&rsquo;t have to add an extra word.</p>
<p>I can simply tweak or modify the word horse by adding an es to the end.</p>
<p>That little suffix, es, is an inflection.</p>
<p>And English can make that subtle change to indicate plurality because it&rsquo;s an Indo-European</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>This is a feature of all Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>Rather than having to insert extra words, Indo-European languages tend to use little</p>
<p>variations of the words themselves.</p>
<p>This is why Chinese can be written in characters, but English can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The Chinese words stay the same, but English words have these little variations and can</p>
<p>only really be represented with an alphabet.</p>
<p>Again, these little variations are inflections.</p>
<p>The same rules basically apply for past tense.</p>
<p>In English, I can distinguish something happening now from something which happened yesterday</p>
<p>by simply adding a little ed at the end of the word.</p>
<p>So to change the horse jumps the fence from present tense to past tense, I just change</p>
<p>jump to jumped with an ed.</p>
<p>Again, this little suffix is an inflection.</p>
<p>But Chinese doesn&rsquo;t use inflections, so you would have to say something like yesterday</p>
<p>the horse jumped the fence or last week the horse jumped the fence.</p>
<p>Again, in English, we can just modify the word jump by putting an ending on it like</p>
<p>ed and that does the same trick.</p>
<p>So these little endings or inflections are still a feature of modern English.</p>
<p>But English has relatively few of them today compared to Old English.</p>
<p>And the earlier forms of the language like Germanic and Indo-European, well they had</p>
<p>even more of those inflections.</p>
<p>Those people basically communicated with each other by constantly modifying and changing</p>
<p>basic words to indicate time and case and almost every aspect and variation of the basic</p>
<p>sentence.</p>
<p>But as I&rsquo;ve said, we use relatively few inflections today compared to the earlier versions of</p>
<p>the language.</p>
<p>And the process of losing inflections began with the early Germanic tribes who spoke that</p>
<p>common Germanic language.</p>
<p>And this process is best represented in verbs, where the Germanic tribes got rid of inflections</p>
<p>in most cases.</p>
<p>In fact, these Germanic speakers got rid of inflections for verbs in all tenses except</p>
<p>present tense and past tense.</p>
<p>And this is still the case in modern English.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s still the case in all modern Germanic languages like German, Swedish, Norwegian,</p>
<p>and Dutch.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look at that a little more closely.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s begin with present tense.</p>
<p>The horse jumps the fence.</p>
<p>Like all Germanic languages, we can indicate present tense with an inflection.</p>
<p>In the case of English, it&rsquo;s the s at the end of the word jump.</p>
<p>And that indicates that the action is happening right now.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s take a look at past tense.</p>
<p>The horse jumped the fence.</p>
<p>Again, we usually use that little ending, ed.</p>
<p>But what about the future?</p>
<p>What if I want to indicate that something is going to happen at a later date?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ll notice that there&rsquo;s no ending I can put on the word jump to indicate that</p>
<p>the horse will do it at a later time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because English has lost the ending or inflection which used to do that.</p>
<p>So I can say, the horse will jump the fence, or the horse is going to jump the fence.</p>
<p>But I have to add new words rather than just changing the word jump.</p>
<p>The word jump actually stays the same.</p>
<p>But the original Indo-European language had an ending for future tense.</p>
<p>And it still exists in most other European languages.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ve studied other Indo-European languages, you&rsquo;ll know all the different verb</p>
<p>tenses that you had to learn.</p>
<p>Like for example, the conditional tense.</p>
<p>The horse could jump the fence.</p>
<p>Or the horse would jump the fence.</p>
<p>Many other European languages can stick a different ending on the word jump to indicate that.</p>
<p>But the original Germanic language lost that ending.</p>
<p>Now we have to use words like could or would to indicate that tense.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the subjunctive tense.</p>
<p>The horse may jump the fence.</p>
<p>Again, other European languages can stick a specific ending on the word jump to express</p>
<p>that idea.</p>
<p>But the original Germanic language lost it.</p>
<p>And now we have to use the word may.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the imperfect indicative tense.</p>
<p>The horse was jumping the fence.</p>
<p>Again, the original Indo-European language had a specific ending to indicate that tense.</p>
<p>But the original Germanic language lost it.</p>
<p>And now we have to use the phrase was jumping.</p>
<p>So all of these verb inflections or endings were lost within the original Germanic language.</p>
<p>The only endings which were retained were the ones used for present tense like jumps</p>
<p>and past tense like jumped.</p>
<p>But for all other verb tenses, we have to add new words to express the idea.</p>
<p>In other words, we have to use a verb phrase.</p>
<p>But the major point here is that this is common throughout all Germanic languages.</p>
<p>So it was something that happened very early on among the original Germanic speakers.</p>
<p>And this is something that distinguished the original Germanic language from Latin.</p>
<p>Latin retained most of those endings.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why modern Romance languages like French and Spanish still have all those</p>
<p>different verb forms.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s why English speakers have so much fun learning how to pronounce and spell those</p>
<p>verbs in future tense, perfect tense, pluperfect tense, conditional tense, and so on.</p>
<p>But English largely avoids all of that complication thanks to those early Germanic tribes in northern</p>
<p>and central Europe.</p>
<p>They simplified the verb forms considerably.</p>
<p>And this marks one of the first major steps in simplifying that original Indo-European</p>
<p>inflectional system.</p>
<p>So the early Germans got rid of the different verb forms except, as I mentioned, in present</p>
<p>and past tense.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that they had all of the ways of expressing tense that</p>
<p>we have in modern English.</p>
<p>For example, will jump, is going to jump, could jump, would jump, may jump, was jumping.</p>
<p>Most of these specific verb phrases developed during later periods of English.</p>
<p>The original Germanic language did use some basic verb phrases to express these ideas,</p>
<p>but they were used much more rarely.</p>
<p>Instead, they relied on the basic present and past tenses to do most of the work.</p>
<p>Thus, the present tense of the verb could also be used to express a future meaning,</p>
<p>but the context would indicate exactly how the verb was being used.</p>
<p>So it would have been somewhat awkward early on, but over time the various Germanic languages</p>
<p>developed more sophisticated verb phrases to replace those lost inflections.</p>
<p>But again, the transition from verb inflections to verb phrases began with the early Germanic</p>
<p>tribes.</p>
<p>Now, before we move on from talking about Germanic verbs, I want to mention one other</p>
<p>thing about past tense verbs.</p>
<p>During the period of the original Indo-European language, the verbs tended to be very irregular.</p>
<p>In other words, the verbs changed significantly in various tenses, and it was really the vowels</p>
<p>or the internal structure of the verb that tended to change.</p>
<p>And we still see that in some of the very old basic verbs which have survived into modern</p>
<p>English.</p>
<p>A classic example is the verb to be in modern English, which appears as am, is, are, was,</p>
<p>were, been, being.</p>
<p>The different versions of these words seem random and not related to each other in any</p>
<p>obvious way.</p>
<p>We also see it, to a lesser extent, in a verb like to go.</p>
<p>The past tense of go is went.</p>
<p>We also see it in words like sing, which appear as sing, sang, sung, and a word like bite,</p>
<p>which appears as bite, bit, and bitten.</p>
<p>All of these variations are also inflections, but you&rsquo;ll notice that the verbs tended to</p>
<p>change internally.</p>
<p>blow, blew, blown, catch, caught, drive, drove, driven.</p>
<p>In modern English, we call these strong verbs because they each have their own internal</p>
<p>rules as they change tense.</p>
<p>You just have to learn them.</p>
<p>But during the very early Germanic period, as the early Germans were starting to get</p>
<p>rid of those Indo-European inflections, they developed a new class of verbs.</p>
<p>These are what we know today as weak verbs.</p>
<p>These tended to be newer verbs.</p>
<p>For these verbs, a general rule was adopted.</p>
<p>The internal structure of the verb would stay the same, but past tense would be indicated</p>
<p>by adding a t or a d sound at the end.</p>
<p>You might remember that these sounds are closely related.</p>
<p>The t and the d sounds are both stops, and the t sound is the unvoiced version of the</p>
<p>d sound.</p>
<p>And this is actually still the general rule for verbs in modern English.</p>
<p>The past tense of jump is jumped.</p>
<p>The past tense of sleep is slept.</p>
<p>The past tense of weep is wept.</p>
<p>The past tense of push is pushed.</p>
<p>I noted that the original Germanic language retained an inflexive for past tense.</p>
<p>But this specific inflection, the d or the t sound at the end, it was unique to the Germanic</p>
<p>languages.</p>
<p>And again, this occurred very early on while there was still a common Germanic language</p>
<p>because these features exist throughout the Germanic languages today.</p>
<p>So the generic ed suffix that we use today to indicate past tense, that goes back to</p>
<p>these same original Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>So why did these Germanic tribes create this ed or t ending for past tense verbs?</p>
<p>Well, no one knows for sure.</p>
<p>One theory is that it came from the verb to do, so that walk in past tense became something</p>
<p>akin to walk did, or how we might say today did walk.</p>
<p>The walk did became walked.</p>
<p>But this is just a theory and one that&rsquo;s not accepted by all linguists.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also believed that most of the initial weak verbs that use this ed or t ending were</p>
<p>words that began as other parts of speech and therefore didn&rsquo;t have an established conjugation</p>
<p>under the traditional Indo-European verb system.</p>
<p>So walk was initially a noun as in take a walk, but eventually it began to be used as</p>
<p>a verb.</p>
<p>And the generic t or d suffix was used to indicate past tense.</p>
<p>Again, this is just a theory.</p>
<p>By the way, I talked about Jacob Grimm in the last episode and we&rsquo;ve looked at his</p>
<p>sound changes in some detail.</p>
<p>Well, it was Jacob Grimm who coined the terms strong verb and weak verb to describe these</p>
<p>different types of verbs.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s become the standard terminology which we still use today.</p>
<p>All new verbs are weak verbs because the ed ending is the only way to make those verbs</p>
<p>past tense.</p>
<p>And again, this specific ed or sometimes t ending is unique to all Germanic languages.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve looked at verbs in the original Germanic language.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s look at nouns.</p>
<p>The first thing I should note is that the original Germanic language continued to have</p>
<p>masculine and feminine nouns.</p>
<p>So this goes back to episode 8 about the original Indo-European grammar.</p>
<p>You may remember that the original Indo-Europeans classified all nouns as either masculine,</p>
<p>feminine or neutral.</p>
<p>And most modern European languages still make these distinctions, at least into masculine</p>
<p>and feminine.</p>
<p>Modern German still uses the neutral version as well.</p>
<p>Well, again, the original Germanic tribes didn&rsquo;t change that.</p>
<p>Now modern English is somewhat unique among Indo-European languages in that it no longer</p>
<p>makes those distinctions.</p>
<p>But that change came much later, during the period of Old English.</p>
<p>Now I noted earlier that we still use inflections for nouns to indicate plurality.</p>
<p>But other than that, we no longer use inflections for nouns.</p>
<p>So we have one car and several cars with an S. That&rsquo;s an inflection.</p>
<p>And we have one ox and several oxen, just like we have one child and several children.</p>
<p>Again, these are all inflections because the noun itself changes.</p>
<p>In other words, the noun is pronounced differently to indicate that there&rsquo;s more than one of</p>
<p>something.</p>
<p>Well, the original Germanic language basically did the same thing.</p>
<p>It also had certain inflections to distinguish one of something from several of something.</p>
<p>But again, the Germanic language was much more inflexive than modern English.</p>
<p>So unlike today, the Germanic language used lots of other inflections with nouns.</p>
<p>So for example, they continued to put little endings on nouns to indicate whether a noun</p>
<p>was the subject of a sentence or the object of a sentence.</p>
<p>I covered all of this back in episode 8 with respect to the Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>The early Germans basically continued this aspect of the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>So for example, the dog chased the cat.</p>
<p>Or the cat chased the dog.</p>
<p>The exact same five words appear in both sentences.</p>
<p>The only difference is the order in which they appear.</p>
<p>But the order is essential in modern English.</p>
<p>When the word dog appears before the verb chased, we know the dog is the one doing the</p>
<p>chasing.</p>
<p>In other words, we know that it&rsquo;s the subject.</p>
<p>But when the word dog appears after the verb, we know that it was the one being chased.</p>
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s the object of the sentence.</p>
<p>Now there are occasional exceptions to this strict rule, but the point here is that we</p>
<p>rely on word order to determine these things today.</p>
<p>But during the time of the Germanic tribes, much like the earlier Indo-Europeans, word</p>
<p>order wasn&rsquo;t really all that important because the little endings which they placed on the</p>
<p>end of the nouns told you which was the subject of the sentence and which was the object.</p>
<p>So you may recall from back in episode 8 that the Indo-European word for horse was the root</p>
<p>of the modern English word equine and equestrian.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably figured out by now that I like to use the same examples.</p>
<p>Well when that word for horse was used as the subject of the sentence, like the horse</p>
<p>jumped the fence, the word was equos with an os ending.</p>
<p>But when the horse was the object of the sentence, like I saw the horse, the word was pronounced</p>
<p>as equam with an om ending.</p>
<p>So the ending or inflection told you whether the word was the subject or the object of</p>
<p>the sentence.</p>
<p>And so it really didn&rsquo;t matter where you put the word in the sentence.</p>
<p>So word order was much looser and more flexible in the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>And it was still the same way in the original Germanic language.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s still the case in modern German as well.</p>
<p>And in fact it was the case in Old English.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until the late Old English and early Middle English period that English finally</p>
<p>lost those noun inflections or endings.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s nouns.</p>
<p>What about pronouns?</p>
<p>Well I, me, us, you, he, it, they, and them all derived from earlier versions within the</p>
<p>original Germanic language.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in the last episode, the pronouns they and them were borrowed from the Old Norse</p>
<p>speakers but they originated within the earlier Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>And she came into English around the time of Early Middle English.</p>
<p>Now in the last episode I stated that she also came from Old Norse.</p>
<p>And nobody called me out on that.</p>
<p>But that may actually have been a bit of a misstatement.</p>
<p>The etymology of she is still disputed.</p>
<p>In fact some argue that it actually has Celtic origins because the Celtic word was very similar.</p>
<p>But regardless of its specific origins, we do know that it didn&rsquo;t appear in English</p>
<p>until after the Old English period.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s keep in mind that the Germanic and Old English pronouns were also highly inflexive.</p>
<p>So just like nouns, the actual pronoun that you used depended on how it was being used</p>
<p>in the sentence.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s assume the third person pronoun he, she, or it was being used as the subject</p>
<p>of a sentence.</p>
<p>In Old English, the masculine version was he, just like today, but it was pronounced</p>
<p>more like hey.</p>
<p>The neutral version was h-i-t, pronounced heat.</p>
<p>But over time the h fell away at the beginning and it just became i-t, eventually pronounced</p>
<p>as it.</p>
<p>The loss of the h sound was quite common.</p>
<p>We see it in the modern pronunciation of words like hour, h-o-u-r, and honor.</p>
<p>The h sound in those words has long since disappeared, but the spelling still reflects</p>
<p>the original pronunciation.</p>
<p>By the way, I discussed the loss of the h sound in the alphabet series, so check that</p>
<p>out if you want to learn more about that.</p>
<p>But anyway, heat eventually became pronounced as it in modern English without the h sound</p>
<p>at the beginning.</p>
<p>When used as the subject, the feminine version was he-o.</p>
<p>So hey, heat, and he-o had that initial h sound.</p>
<p>And we still see that in him and her, and his and hers, all of which retain the h sound.</p>
<p>But as I noted, the feminine version, he-o, was eventually replaced by she in early Middle</p>
<p>English.</p>
<p>And no one knows for sure why that happened, but the main point of this discussion about</p>
<p>he, she, and it is to help you see the connections between those pronouns.</p>
<p>During the earlier Germanic period, these various third person pronouns were much more</p>
<p>similar to each other than they are today.</p>
<p>By the way, those are the third person pronouns, but with respect to the first and second person</p>
<p>pronouns, the original Germanic speakers had a singular and plural version just like today,</p>
<p>but they also retained a dual version from the original Indo-Europeans, which referred</p>
<p>to a pair of something.</p>
<p>So they not only had a version of I and us, they also had a pronoun which meant we two</p>
<p>or the two of us.</p>
<p>And they not only had a version of you singular and you plural, like you all, but they also</p>
<p>had a version which meant you two or the two of you.</p>
<p>So again, this goes back to the original Indo-Europeans, and the early Germans retained</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And in fact, those dual pronouns passed into early Gothic and Old Norse.</p>
<p>So the Eastern and Northern dialects retained it for a while, but the Western dialects dropped</p>
<p>the dual version early on.</p>
<p>So Old English never really had a dual version.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve discussed verbs, nouns, and pronouns.</p>
<p>Let me mention something about adjectives.</p>
<p>Like everything else, adjectives also use lots of inflections or endings to convey specific</p>
<p>meanings.</p>
<p>And we still have a few of those in Modern English.</p>
<p>For example, we still use inflections to indicate the comparative and superlative cases.</p>
<p>That sounds very fancy, but it&rsquo;s the difference between large, larger, and largest.</p>
<p>Those are really perfect examples of inflections.</p>
<p>Those little endings convey essential meanings, and again, we get them from the original Germanic</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>I also wanted to note another sound shift which occurred within the early Germanic language.</p>
<p>I discussed the sound changes associated with Grimm&rsquo;s Law in the last episode.</p>
<p>Well, in addition to those changes, there was another subtle change that occurred during</p>
<p>this early period.</p>
<p>The early Germanic language had a sound that was somewhere between an S or Z sound and</p>
<p>an R sound.</p>
<p>It was a unique sound that we don&rsquo;t really have in Modern English.</p>
<p>But it was the product of a sound shift.</p>
<p>There was an earlier Z sound which eventually shifted to an R sound.</p>
<p>And this sound was right in the middle of that change during the early Germanic period.</p>
<p>And we can still see relics of that sound shift in Modern English.</p>
<p>We can see it in was vs. were and most vs. more.</p>
<p>One version retains the original sibilant sound, the S or Z sound, and the other reflects</p>
<p>the newer R sound which developed within the later Germanic languages.</p>
<p>And these differences develop largely due to different stresses in the syllables of</p>
<p>words.</p>
<p>Differences in stress led to certain shifts in the sound.</p>
<p>In fact, this particular sound shift is very common across many different languages.</p>
<p>In fact, it has its own name in linguistics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called rhoticism.</p>
<p>But the point here is that this particular sound shift was still in the process of change</p>
<p>during the early Germanic period.</p>
<p>Now I should note that linguists who have studied Gothic have discovered that Gothic</p>
<p>apparently didn&rsquo;t have this particular sound shift to the R sound.</p>
<p>So linguists used this as evidence to indicate that those Gothic tribes began their eastward</p>
<p>migration very early on and this R sound change occurred shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s the case, that means that this sound shift was not part of the original</p>
<p>common Germanic language.</p>
<p>It must have developed slightly later after the Goths split off.</p>
<p>But this is kind of a technical point because this sound shift is common throughout the</p>
<p>other Germanic languages, including all of the modern Germanic languages.</p>
<p>So that brings me to the final point which I wanted to discuss in regard to Germanic</p>
<p>grammar.</p>
<p>And interestingly, it&rsquo;s one of the easiest aspects of Germanic grammar to understand,</p>
<p>but it may have had the most far-reaching implications as far as modern English is concerned.</p>
<p>And this particular aspect of the original Germanic language was the way multi-syllable</p>
<p>words were stressed when they were pronounced.</p>
<p>And surprisingly enough, this is actually very simple.</p>
<p>In the original Germanic language, the stress was almost always placed on the first syllable</p>
<p>of a word.</p>
<p>Now some words had prefixes and in those cases, the prefixes were not stressed.</p>
<p>So to be a little more accurate, we can say that the base syllable was stressed.</p>
<p>Now in modern English, there is no general rule for stress.</p>
<p>Stress can appear at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end.</p>
<p>And this is actually much like the original Indo-European language where the stress could</p>
<p>appear at various locations.</p>
<p>Now part of the reason why the stress varies a lot in modern English is because English</p>
<p>has so many borrowed words.</p>
<p>And many of those words had the stress in the middle or at the end when they were borrowed.</p>
<p>But despite the lack of consistency in modern English, we can still say that there is a</p>
<p>default tendency to emphasize the first syllable in modern English.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also true of modern German, by the way.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look at this default tendency by comparing modern English words to French words</p>
<p>where the tendency is to emphasize the final syllable.</p>
<p>So in English, we have a word like Paris.</p>
<p>But in French, it&rsquo;s Paris.</p>
<p>In English, we have a word like mansion.</p>
<p>But in French, it&rsquo;s maison.</p>
<p>In English, we have voyage.</p>
<p>In French, you have voyage.</p>
<p>In English, we have difference.</p>
<p>In French, it&rsquo;s diff√©rance, as in vive la diff√©rence.</p>
<p>So English still has this tendency to put the emphasis on the first syllable.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really just a tendency today.</p>
<p>One of my favorite examples of this is American aluminum versus British aluminium.</p>
<p>Each dialect puts the emphasis in a different place.</p>
<p>But neither puts it on the A at the beginning.</p>
<p>But again, if you go through lots of multi-syllable words in English, you&rsquo;ll find that English</p>
<p>tends to put the stress on the first syllable more often than not.</p>
<p>Now modern English is actually much like the original Indo-European language in this respect.</p>
<p>As I noted earlier, the original Indo-European language also put the stress on different</p>
<p>syllables and different words.</p>
<p>So there doesn&rsquo;t appear to be a consistent rule in the original language.</p>
<p>But by the time we get to the Germanic period, the emphasis was consistently put on the first</p>
<p>syllable.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of the reason why we still have that tendency in modern English.</p>
<p>But again, this wasn&rsquo;t a tendency in the original Germanic language.</p>
<p>It was a pretty much universal rule, with very limited exceptions, like prefixes, which</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>And linguists have even determined that this shift of emphasis to the first syllable occurred</p>
<p>after the sound changes associated with Grimm&rsquo;s Law.</p>
<p>And the reason for that conclusion is because sound shifts are actually closely tied to</p>
<p>the way syllables are stressed.</p>
<p>And in fact, the reason why some of those consonants shifted in some words and didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>shift in other words is because of the way syllables in the words were stressed.</p>
<p>You might remember that Jacob Grimm never called the rules he formulated laws, because</p>
<p>there were lots of exceptions which he couldn&rsquo;t explain.</p>
<p>Well, later linguists like Carl Werner explained those exceptions largely based on the way</p>
<p>syllables were stressed.</p>
<p>So sometimes a consonant didn&rsquo;t shift to a new sound because the immediately preceding</p>
<p>syllable was stressed.</p>
<p>Anyway, based on all that research, later linguists concluded that there was more variation</p>
<p>in the way words were stressed early on, but by the later period of the original Germanic</p>
<p>language, the stress had shifted to the first syllable.</p>
<p>So big deal, you say.</p>
<p>Why is it that stress on the first syllable is so important?</p>
<p>Well, the answer has to do with what happens when you emphasize the first part of a word.</p>
<p>You tend to de-emphasize the end of the word.</p>
<p>Take the word syllable.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t normally enunciate every syllable in the word syllable.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t typically say syllable.</p>
<p>We just say syllable.</p>
<p>So the end of the word comes out sounding something like buh or buh.</p>
<p>So in other words, we tend to slur or cut off the end of the word.</p>
<p>And so if the stress is always on the first syllable, then the end of the words routinely</p>
<p>get cut short or they&rsquo;re slurred.</p>
<p>But think about where all of those inflections that I&rsquo;ve talked about are located.</p>
<p>They were typically placed at the end of the words.</p>
<p>So now, within the original Germanic language, many of those inflections were being de-emphasized</p>
<p>and they were often being lost in common speech.</p>
<p>Now many linguists believe that this may have been part of the reason why the early Germanic</p>
<p>language began to lose some of its inflections altogether.</p>
<p>So all of those verb inflections in the Indo-European language were reduced to just two situations</p>
<p>in the Germanic languages, present tense and past tense.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the Germanic language required a verb phrase.</p>
<p>In other words, it required additional words to be added into the sentence.</p>
<p>And the Indo-European language had eight separate cases for nouns, which I discussed back in</p>
<p>episode eight.</p>
<p>But now the Germanic tribes got rid of at least two of those and rarely used a couple</p>
<p>of others.</p>
<p>Of course, some of those various inflections were retained into later versions of the language</p>
<p>like Old English and German.</p>
<p>But some of those lost inflections were likely the result of this syllable stress pattern.</p>
<p>So anyway, I hope you found this episode interesting.</p>
<p>My goal here was to illustrate how the early Germanic language was beginning to change</p>
<p>in certain fundamental ways from the earlier Indo-European language.</p>
<p>Not only were old words being pronounced differently, and new words being adopted from other peoples,</p>
<p>but the early Germans were beginning to use those words in new and unique ways.</p>
<p>So this was really a transitional period for the language.</p>
<p>Now next time, I&rsquo;m going to return to the actual history of the Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll look at the state of the tribes around the first century A.D., or Common Era.</p>
<p>This was the time of the Roman historian Tacitus, and he gives us the first detailed written</p>
<p>account of these people.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll look at certain cultural aspects of these tribes which are reflected in words</p>
<p>from this period, and which are still found in modern English.</p>
<p>So until next time, thanks for listening to the History of English podcast.</p>
