    <p>Welcome to this special I&rsquo;ve Had It podcast bonus episode.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m Jennifer, I&rsquo;m Angie, and we are so happy to see you on this Thursday.</p>
<p>You see you in tees.</p>
<p>Pumps, how do you feel about the situation where you go through an email, okay, I go</p>
<p>through an email that I didn&rsquo;t subscribe for, that&rsquo;s a solicitation that I didn&rsquo;t sign up</p>
<p>for.</p>
<p>So then I click unsubscribe, okay?</p>
<p>And I want it to end there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve broken up to a relationship that was forced upon me.</p>
<p>One could even go as far as to call it email rape.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t consent, okay?</p>
<p>So I unsubscribe, right?</p>
<p>And then I think it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>And then I get a follow-up email confirming that I&rsquo;ve unsubscribed, and then they want</p>
<p>me to click more buttons.</p>
<p>I think, here&rsquo;s what I think about that, because I&rsquo;ve had that many times.</p>
<p>I think they, if you don&rsquo;t do it a couple other times, if you just think you&rsquo;re done,</p>
<p>they can still send you emails.</p>
<p>I think they make it where it&rsquo;s harder to unsubscribe than just hitting one button.</p>
<p>What I want to know is how many people that are solicited via email actually buy shit?</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t know, but I would liken it to, remember that one time we were at Sonic</p>
<p>and they were all, every time we would order, you know, we went two vanilla Cokes, whatever,</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;d say, would you like extra tater tots with that?</p>
<p>Would you like cheese balls with that?</p>
<p>Stuff like that.</p>
<p>And you would just get infuriated.</p>
<p>Sonic have cheese balls?</p>
<p>Or the cheese, I don&rsquo;t know what they are, but there&rsquo;s like cheese in the middle, fried</p>
<p>cheese something.</p>
<p>And one time you were furious and you go, do people actually buy stuff that you suggest</p>
<p>at the end?</p>
<p>I said that to the Sonic person?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And you know what he said?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yes, they do.</p>
<p>Almost all the time.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s the same with the email.</p>
<p>I think people are ordering off the email.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re feeding that stray cat.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re feeding the stray cat.</p>
<p>They are feeding that stray cat and everybody needs to stop.</p>
<p>The email terrorism is out of control and nobody&rsquo;s doing anything about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going on right now, invasions of inboxes without consent and everybody just acts like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not okay.</p>
<p>And everybody just goes on with life and we&rsquo;re all walking around like we&rsquo;re not being violated</p>
<p>and we are.</p>
<p>Right now, I guarantee you, I already have five.</p>
<p>I hate to tell you that I&rsquo;ve kind of cracked the case on this where I just have a separate</p>
<p>email for all the bullshit that I don&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s smart.</p>
<p>I mean, I just-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s smart.</p>
<p>Everything goes in there.</p>
<p>Everything I buy off the internet goes in there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s smart.</p>
<p>All of that.</p>
<p>And then I don&rsquo;t see it, but here&rsquo;s what did fuck me this last Christmas because I&rsquo;m proud</p>
<p>to say I did not go into one store for Christmas shopping.</p>
<p>Did everything online.</p>
<p>Not really big into that shop local thing?</p>
<p>No, not big at shopping at all.</p>
<p>But so for a couple of the discounts, it was like for 15% off, put your cell phone</p>
<p>or email or whatever.</p>
<p>So I put my cell phone in.</p>
<p>I get texts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a rookie mistake.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>And I have three different ones.</p>
<p>Rookie.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know how to stop them.</p>
<p>You never give your phone number.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Ever.</p>
<p>It was bad.</p>
<p>It was really, really bad.</p>
<p>Well, what we want to do today is hear from the listener what they have had it with.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Lead us off.</p>
<p>Who do we have?</p>
<p>First?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got Alyssa S.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with play days for toddlers that are like, you know, under five, under six.</p>
<p>This play date ends up being me forced to hang out with parents.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to hang out at my most recent play date.</p>
<p>I went on, which I really didn&rsquo;t want to go to the mom, bent my arm.</p>
<p>She pulled out a ukulele.</p>
<p>I wanted to do a group sing along.</p>
<p>There is nothing less I want to do.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t get out of there quick enough.</p>
<p>Never once have I wanted to be like, oh my God, I got to shit my pants and actually shit</p>
<p>my pants just to get out of the situation.</p>
<p>The ukulele.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>That is horrible.</p>
<p>I have had it.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what I would do if someone had that ukulele.</p>
<p>That is awful.</p>
<p>That is that positive and that good of a mood all the time that when you&rsquo;re hanging out</p>
<p>with toddlers, you&rsquo;re going to bust out a ukulele, sing along, get the fuck away from</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t with that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too much.</p>
<p>It is interesting, Alyssa.</p>
<p>I had the exact same problem.</p>
<p>So one of my son&rsquo;s play dates around five, six ish, we invited the kid over.</p>
<p>His mother stayed the entire play date with the child&rsquo;s little sister at my house.</p>
<p>In my head, I&rsquo;m thinking, why is she not leaving?</p>
<p>I think she just wanted to visit, blah, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>I was like, so when the kid left, the next time my son asked if so-and-so could come</p>
<p>over, I said, absolutely not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having a play date so that my kid is entertained by your kid.</p>
<p>And at no part of that does that mean I want to take on the mother to entertain.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just unbelievable.</p>
<p>Do you think she was there because she was like a helicopter?</p>
<p>No, I think she was lonely because she did it to another friend of ours, a mutual friend,</p>
<p>the exact same setup.</p>
<p>And I hadn&rsquo;t told her beforehand, but she had the exact same experience.</p>
<p>And then her kid was never allowed to have that kid over again either because nobody</p>
<p>wants the mother?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I had a situation with Dylan, my first, where he was probably in like second or third grade.</p>
<p>And the mom was like, hey, can Dylan come over to our house after school for like two</p>
<p>hours?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you betcha.</p>
<p>Swing for the fences, take him.</p>
<p>And then I started getting these follow-up texts, like an itinerary, like I&rsquo;ve planned</p>
<p>for us to play this from, you know, three to 3.30 and then we&rsquo;re going to do puzzles.</p>
<p>And like three days before the play date, she texted me and told me that she was planning</p>
<p>the snack three days in advance and asked if Dylan had any food allergies.</p>
<p>And I literally just wanted to take my phone and just chunk it and just throw it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like, what on earth?</p>
<p>If Dylan had food allergies, A, I&rsquo;d let you know.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d tell you before you had to ask.</p>
<p>Immediately.</p>
<p>I would take that burden on.</p>
<p>And just, I just thought, good God, this is so pathetic.</p>
<p>Let the kids just get together and do whatever it is that they&rsquo;re going to do and serve them.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, like the planning three days in advance, a toddler snack, I mean,</p>
<p>put a sock in it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That is like, Jesus Christ, that&rsquo;s dumb.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, I feel like that person probably would have done better with like a part-time</p>
<p>job.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Kylie, who&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>Up next, we&rsquo;ve got Rod R.</p>
<p>Rod R.</p>
<p>Hi, y&rsquo;all.</p>
<p>I have had it with the good old boy system at the fucking four-way stop.</p>
<p>If you get there first, fucking go.</p>
<p>If we get there at the same time and you&rsquo;re on the right, fucking go.</p>
<p>I hate this.</p>
<p>I pull up and they&rsquo;re waving you on like, oh no, buddy, go ahead.</p>
<p>No, follow the rules.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s all get to where we&rsquo;re fucking going.</p>
<p>Y&rsquo;all have a good day.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s 100% right.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s 100% right.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s 100% right.</p>
<p>This happens all the time.</p>
<p>I kind of think I might be an offender.</p>
<p>I bet you are.</p>
<p>Rod, I just hate that.</p>
<p>But Rod&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s 100% right.</p>
<p>Do you know, I mean, it is, you can get into this tit for tat.</p>
<p>You go, then everybody like, accelerate, brake.</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>Accelerate, brake.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s 100%.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m not playing it anymore.</p>
<p>I, if that person&rsquo;s on the right and we arrived at the same time, I will remain steadfast with</p>
<p>my foot on the brake.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m not playing it anymore.</p>
<p>I, if that person&rsquo;s on the right and we arrived at the same time, I will remain steadfast with</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s 100%.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m not playing it anymore.</p>
<p>I, if that person&rsquo;s on the right and we arrived at the same time, I will remain steadfast</p>
<p>with my foot on the brake.</p>
<p>Because the minute they wave me on, then they&rsquo;re going to change their mind.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s chaos at the stop sign.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m bad about that.</p>
<p>I need to get better.</p>
<p>I just on the way here today, I had that little issue.</p>
<p>I kind of go through this a little bit at pickleball.</p>
<p>So you have like, when you&rsquo;re on the right side of the court, you know, that would be</p>
<p>considered if you&rsquo;re right-handed, your backhand side.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re on the left side of the court, that&rsquo;s your forehand side.</p>
<p>So any ball that goes down the center, the forehand takes, well, some of these girls</p>
<p>that I play with are poaching over on their backhand on my forehand shot and I have fucking</p>
<p>had it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Linda, you know who you are.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s always coming over and poaching and it&rsquo;s like, let my forehand take it.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s kind of chaos in the pickleball courts, chaos at the stop signs.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re so brave.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an athlete.</p>
<p>I am a fucking athlete.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry that you haven&rsquo;t discovered like midlife athleticism, but the jealousy does</p>
<p>not look good on you.</p>
<p>Kylie, what&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe you were able to weave pickleball into that one.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s never ceases to amaze me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a gift.</p>
<p>We could say, hi, I have to go downstairs to pee and get five minutes of a pickleball</p>
<p>story.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>I mean, I think it just sits on her brain all day.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think that most athletes have their sport on their brain?</p>
<p>Michael Jordan, Rafa Nadal, Roger Federer, Jennifer Welch in pickleball.</p>
<p>I mean, if there&rsquo;s an Olympics for pickleball, I&rsquo;m nowhere near good enough to be in it,</p>
<p>but I train as though and I give as much time commitment as though I&rsquo;m supposed to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not half assed in this thing.</p>
<p>No, you are definitely not half assing it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Up next, we&rsquo;ve got Tammy M.</p>
<p>Here is what I&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with straight women using the term partner for their male boyfriend or male</p>
<p>husband period.</p>
<p>The term partner has been reserved and used by the gay community since existence because</p>
<p>we were not allowed to be legally married.</p>
<p>We used the term partner.</p>
<p>Now, it doesn&rsquo;t bother me so much.</p>
<p>However, my partner, she&rsquo;s what we call a lesbian ninja.</p>
<p>She is super feminine, so she walks amongst the straights completely undetected.</p>
<p>When she meets another female who starts talking about their partner, my ninja lesbian gets</p>
<p>all excited thinking she&rsquo;s met another ninja lesbian only for that woman to whip out a</p>
<p>picture of her boyfriend or husband and totally shatter her dreams.</p>
<p>So straight people, stop using the term partner.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s ours.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all we got.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>A couple of things to unpack here.</p>
<p>First and foremost, she&rsquo;s 100% right.</p>
<p>Straight people have gobbled that up and that&rsquo;s not right.</p>
<p>That is exclusively for gay people, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I agree with that.</p>
<p>Secondly, I&rsquo;ve got to talk about ninja lesbians.</p>
<p>The first time I&rsquo;ve ever heard it, we have got to dissect this shit because that is fucking</p>
<p>10 out of 10.</p>
<p>I had never heard that either and I love it.</p>
<p>So a ninja lesbian is the super feminine that dolls up.</p>
<p>According to Tammy, the ninja lesbian can go about and interact with the straights undetected</p>
<p>as a lesbian.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s out like totally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like stealth lesbianism.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I mean, I play pickleball with a lot of lesbians and there&rsquo;s a couple of them that if I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know that they were gay, they would definitely be ninja lesbians, but of course I know that</p>
<p>they are.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I love this whole ninja.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a new word.</p>
<p>Is that a word that is common amongst the lesbian community?</p>
<p>I had never heard it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So ninja lesbians.</p>
<p>New word from Tammy.</p>
<p>You are welcome here on I&rsquo;ve Had It Podcast.</p>
<p>We want to know what you&rsquo;ve had it with ninja lesbians, our new obsession.</p>
<p>New obsession.</p>
<p>Kylie, how do you feel about ninja lesbians?</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m dating one.</p>
<p>You sure are.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>Anna is 100% a ninja lesbian.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a walking Bratz doll.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You would never know.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Never in a million years.</p>
<p>Anna is 100% the poster child for a ninja lesbian.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>She is.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s next, Kylie?</p>
<p>The last one we&rsquo;ve got is Danielle R.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right, ladies, I have fucking had it with these boutique cycle bar or whatever you want</p>
<p>to call them, classes where they&rsquo;re all pretending that they&rsquo;re working out, but it&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>bunch of sexy people doing a circle jerk to genuine pony and other pop hits.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but if I wanted to do that, I could do that at home for free,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m tired of seeing the videos online.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Love you, ladies.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s had it with, is it spin class?</p>
<p>Spin class is what it sounds like to me.</p>
<p>So like the Peloton, the Pelotoners?</p>
<p>Or is it the class that like the cycle bar?</p>
<p>The Soul Cycles?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I see that on Instagram and it&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s one girl that in particular that I follow</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Hardcore.</p>
<p>First of all, I&rsquo;m just going to say I&rsquo;m kind of, I&rsquo;ve had it with people posting their</p>
<p>exercise videos online.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>Enough.</p>
<p>You can ride a stationary bike.</p>
<p>Congratulations.</p>
<p>You know, I mean&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re so talented.</p>
<p>You can stand up and down on the stationary bike to music.</p>
<p>Fucking awesome.</p>
<p>Good for you.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move on.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you can run.</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>You can lift a weight.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re super proud of you.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Enough.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s like a humble brag, I think.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<p>I mean, we all know, I think I&rsquo;ve brought pickleball into this episode at least 25 times.</p>
<p>At least.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really post fucking pickleball videos, which is kind of surprising now that we think</p>
<p>about it.</p>
<p>Let me just say, if I had one of those little tripods that I could set up&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s too far.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s too far.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think maybe she&rsquo;s talking about Peloton, too.</p>
<p>I just, I think she, yeah, I think she&rsquo;s talking about the people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the stationary bicyclists posting Instagram videos, and they kind of like dance,</p>
<p>bounce up and down on the bike.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve seen that, too, but not, do people, do you get that in your feed, like, on the</p>
<p>reels part?</p>
<p>Because I get mukbang, and you&rsquo;re rolling out with&hellip;</p>
<p>I get a lot of Frenchie travel interior design stuff.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get the mukbang, but there are some people that I follow that have their exercise</p>
<p>workouts day after day after day after day that now I finally muted because I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to see that person exercise anymore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not fresh.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not into it.</p>
<p>Well, and I think there&rsquo;s a narcissism that you think anyone gives a flying fuck what</p>
<p>you did for workout today.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Well, maybe they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the only person that cares.</p>
<p>Now, I will say, I may have been an offender in the past, I did go to Orange Theory every</p>
<p>day.</p>
<p>And at the end of Orange Theory class, you get a little report as to how much time you</p>
<p>spent in each heart rate zone.</p>
<p>And if I had a really good day, I would share my Orange Theory report on my Instagram story.</p>
<p>And as I&rsquo;m telling you this, I acknowledge nobody gave a fuck.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re so lucky that I was not on Instagram until this October.</p>
<p>I acknowledge that it was probably not my best posting.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Jennifer.</p>
<p>But I worked really hard for the calorie burn.</p>
<p>Orange Theory is fucking hard.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>It was a story.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a permanent post.</p>
<p>It expired.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>It was.</p>
<p>It was bad.</p>
<p>It was.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re part of the problem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just so glad I wasn&rsquo;t on Instagram then.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to get a tripod.</p>
<p>Because I would have lit you up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to get a tripod and I&rsquo;m going to start recording my pickleball matches.</p>
<p>Because so many people want to watch you play pickleball.</p>
<p>I think you might be surprised.</p>
<p>I think you might be surprised.</p>
<p>There could be 108 people in the Netherlands that want to watch me play pickleball.</p>
<p>So fuck off.</p>
<p>The Dutch.</p>
<p>A.K.A.</p>
<p>The Dutch.</p>
<p>The Dutch.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
