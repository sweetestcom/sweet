    <ul>
<li>Good afternoon everybody, I&rsquo;m Ann Harrison.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m the Dean at the Haas School of Business.</p>
<p>Welcome everyone to the first Dean&rsquo;s Speaker Series</p>
<p>of our spring semester.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really excited and honored to introduce today&rsquo;s speaker</p>
<p>and Berkeley alum, Vanessa Morrison.</p>
<p>Vanessa graduated with a bachelor&rsquo;s in rhetoric</p>
<p>from UC Berkeley class of &lsquo;90.</p>
<p>Today, Vanessa serves as president streaming</p>
<p>for Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture Production.</p>
<p>In this role, she has the responsibility</p>
<p>for oversight of all Walt Disney Studios</p>
<p>motion picture projects for Disney+.</p>
<p>Current projects of hers include &ldquo;Cheaper by the Dozen&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That was one of my favorite books that I read</p>
<p>as a young adult and a series of projects based on content</p>
<p>from &ldquo;Ice Age&rdquo;, &ldquo;Night at the Museum&rdquo;</p>
<p>and another one of my younger daughter&rsquo;s favorites,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diary of a Wimpy Kid&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Vanessa has held numerous leadership positions</p>
<p>throughout her illustrious career</p>
<p>in the entertainment industry,</p>
<p>including as president of Fox Family</p>
<p>and a decade long tenure as president</p>
<p>of 20th Century Fox Animation.</p>
<p>Her list of accolades includes</p>
<p>overseeing the film &ldquo;Ferdinand&rdquo;, another book that I loved,</p>
<p>which was nominated for both an Academy Award</p>
<p>and a Golden Globe for best animated feature.</p>
<p>Vanessa is a leader who consistently goes beyond herself,</p>
<p>being named to the Women in Film Board of Directors,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s currently serving on the UC Berkeley Chancellor&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Board of Visitors and the Women in Animation Advisory Board.</p>
<p>Vanessa thank you so much for taking the time</p>
<p>to speak with us today.</p>
<p>We are extremely grateful and we really look forward</p>
<p>to a lively and informative discussion.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s conversation will be led</p>
<p>by Mukundha Sastry, MBA &lsquo;22.</p>
<p>Now, if you have questions for Vanessa while she&rsquo;s speaking,</p>
<p>please put them in the YouTube chat</p>
<p>so we can try to get to all of them</p>
<p>after the initial conversation,</p>
<p>Mukundha, take it away.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks Dean Harrison,</li>
</ul>
<p>really excited to be here with you all today</p>
<p>and to have the opportunity to speak with Vanessa.</p>
<p>As Dean Harrison mentioned, my name is Mukundha.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a second year MBA at Haas and I serve</p>
<p>as the co president of the Entertainment Media Club here.</p>
<p>Vanessa, we&rsquo;re so excited to have you here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such an honor to have someone like you</p>
<p>at Haas with us.</p>
<p>We rarely get to have such incredible visionaries</p>
<p>in the entertainment industry here.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re really grateful that you&rsquo;re able</p>
<p>to make the time to speak with us.</p>
<p>So we first wanted to start off just by hearing</p>
<p>a little bit about your Berkeley roots.</p>
<p>Would you mind reflecting back in sharing with us</p>
<p>some of your favorite takeaways from your time at Cal?</p>
<ul>
<li>Sure and thank you for having me.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wish I could be there in person.</p>
<p>I wish we could all be there in person,</p>
<p>but I will be one day.</p>
<p>So as you know I graduated from undergrad at Berkeley,</p>
<p>but my roots run deep in Berkeley.</p>
<p>I grew up in Berkeley in the city, went to Berkeley High</p>
<p>and my father taught at Berkeley.</p>
<p>My father was a physics professor at Berkeley</p>
<p>and an assistant Dean in Letters and Science at Berkeley.</p>
<p>And my mother actually got her master&rsquo;s degree</p>
<p>at Berkeley as well.</p>
<p>So Berkeley was ingrained in my soul</p>
<p>from a very, very young age.</p>
<p>And I think both of my parents valued</p>
<p>and really believed in the UC system.</p>
<p>And when I was coming out of high school,</p>
<p>I think I only applied to UC.</p>
<p>So I think I applied to four UCs, Berkeley, UCLA, Davis.</p>
<p>And there was one other, I can&rsquo;t remember now,</p>
<p>but I only applied to UCs because my family</p>
<p>so believed in the value of the University of California</p>
<p>and Berkeley was our favorite.</p>
<p>So I really grew up on the Berkeley campus as a kid</p>
<p>and as a young person.</p>
<p>And so when I went to Cal I majored in rhetoric</p>
<p>and rhetoric for me was a way of finding a discipline</p>
<p>that kind of braided all the things</p>
<p>that I was interested in together.</p>
<p>It had an emphasis on literature, which I was interested in,</p>
<p>but it also was kind of open enough that I could weave in</p>
<p>my interest in film and my interest in other things</p>
<p>into that discipline.</p>
<p>So I was able to really kind of get through rhetoric</p>
<p>and also through my affiliation</p>
<p>with the Pacific Film Archive which I loved.</p>
<p>I was able to kind of really get a education in film</p>
<p>at Berkeley through classes I put together on my own</p>
<p>and different experiences I had through the PFA.</p>
<p>So Berkeley means a lot to me.</p>
<p>It means a lot to me personally.</p>
<p>It means a lot to me in the sense that my parents came here</p>
<p>in the &rsquo;60s with the spirit of really being a part</p>
<p>of what Berkeley meant both academically</p>
<p>and also in terms of what the social fabric</p>
<p>of Berkeley meant and means.</p>
<p>And it also professionally was where I really got</p>
<p>a background in film and writing and some of the things</p>
<p>that I really love.</p>
<p>So Berkeley means a lot.</p>
<ul>
<li>I love that, I love how much passion</li>
</ul>
<p>you have for this school.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so inspiring to see that you took the initiative</p>
<p>to major in film, even in the undergrad level.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s something that at Haas,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just so inspiring to see someone take</p>
<p>their personal passion and manifest that into a career.</p>
<p>Before we move on from Berkeley, I&rsquo;m curious to know though</p>
<p>your passion for Berkeley has even extended</p>
<p>to now as an executive, you still serve</p>
<p>at the Office of Chancellor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear sort of about how Berkeley&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that fabric has continued even now.</p>
<ul>
<li>Well I think people that have gone to Berkeley</li>
</ul>
<p>or it&rsquo;s my experience that people that have gone to Berkeley</p>
<p>have this kind of rabid dedication to the school.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s our pleasure to still stay connected to the school</p>
<p>in any way that we can.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been serving on the Board of Visitors,</p>
<p>which has been fantastic and help out in any way</p>
<p>that I can at Berkeley.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very interested in just informally and formally</p>
<p>providing any sort of advice or mentorship or connection</p>
<p>to any students or any organization that is</p>
<p>curious about life outside of Berkeley.</p>
<p>And some of the things, the pathways leading</p>
<p>out of the Berkeley education</p>
<p>into kind of professional life.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of opportunity I think,</p>
<p>for people that have kind of made those transitions,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s undergraduate, graduate level, MBA programs,</p>
<p>in terms of kind of what those pathways can be</p>
<p>once you have that all powerful Berkeley degree.</p>
<p>And so I always leap at the opportunity to kind of</p>
<p>participate in anything that I can as an alumni</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s connected to Berkeley.</p>
<ul>
<li>I love that, it&rsquo;s really inspiring.</li>
</ul>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a good note for all of us also</p>
<p>to sort of take that passion with us wherever we go,</p>
<p>and mentorship is huge.</p>
<p>And I love that you&rsquo;re able to offer that</p>
<p>to future students, so thank you for that.</p>
<ul>
<li>And I said, there&rsquo;s one other thing I&rsquo;ll say too,</li>
</ul>
<p>which is that I think I&rsquo;ve learned so much</p>
<p>from my interactions as a professional person</p>
<p>with Berkeley students and Berkeley faculty</p>
<p>and the administration.</p>
<p>I feel like Berkeley&rsquo;s such a dynamic institution.</p>
<p>Every time I come up there, I feel like I learn something</p>
<p>that blows my mind in one way or another.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m very jealous of you guys that get the opportunity</p>
<p>just to be in this environment all the time.</p>
<ul>
<li>I mean, we&rsquo;re learning from each other</li>
</ul>
<p>and we&rsquo;re also learning from the undergrads too.</p>
<p>So I feel that also (laughing).</p>
<p>So I guess, like thinking about your career in film</p>
<p>and also you&rsquo;re at the earliest level in undergrad majoring,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious what was that earliest moment</p>
<p>you can remember in your life where you realized</p>
<p>you wanted to be in film,</p>
<p>you wanted to manifest your career in this industry.</p>
<p>Is there a particular time that you can think of</p>
<p>that really sparked that interest for you?</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s interesting, I think I&rsquo;ve always been interested</li>
</ul>
<p>in storytelling.</p>
<p>I think people in my family have always been good,</p>
<p>kind of natural storytellers.</p>
<p>And also I&rsquo;ve always been interested in literature,</p>
<p>but visual storytelling.</p>
<p>All of those things were always really important to me.</p>
<p>But when I was a kid,</p>
<p>my mother was a part of an organization</p>
<p>that was based out of the Oakland Museum</p>
<p>called Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>And it was an organization that was started</p>
<p>out of different&hellip;</p>
<p>It was a community organization,</p>
<p>although it was kind of housed and based in Oakland</p>
<p>and in Berkeley and had an affiliation with the art museum.</p>
<p>So as a kid, I would see my mother participating</p>
<p>in this organization which held a yearly event</p>
<p>at the Paramount Theater in Oakland.</p>
<p>And what they would do would be,</p>
<p>they would honor African-American filmmakers</p>
<p>and black filmmakers whose contributions</p>
<p>hadn&rsquo;t been acknowledged necessarily in mainstream media.</p>
<p>So through that organization,</p>
<p>I really kind of got both an education</p>
<p>and a spark for film I believe,</p>
<p>and got to meet and see, up close and personal,</p>
<p>all these amazing filmmakers and really kind of got</p>
<p>a deep dive into the history of cinema</p>
<p>from a different perspective.</p>
<p>And so in some ways, I always like to think that it was</p>
<p>that experience had kind of a profound impact on me</p>
<p>in terms of really being able to see myself</p>
<p>as a black woman, as someone who could really</p>
<p>get into the film industry and have a story</p>
<p>with a perspective and get to meet filmmakers</p>
<p>from all around the world.</p>
<p>So that had a huge impact I think on my interest</p>
<p>in film specifically.</p>
<p>As I went to Berkeley, I mentioned it before,</p>
<p>another really impactful thing was the Pacific Film Archive.</p>
<p>And at this time, I don&rsquo;t know if they still have it,</p>
<p>but there was a student committee that was affiliated</p>
<p>with both the art museum and the Pacific Film Archives.</p>
<p>And I was the head of that art museum committee</p>
<p>for a couple of years.</p>
<p>So I was able to kind of really do a deep dive</p>
<p>in terms of film and really kind of got a whole nother</p>
<p>education in film through the marvelous things</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re able to see through that amazing organization.</p>
<p>So that was a big part of my understanding and my education</p>
<p>in film and film history as well.</p>
<p>And another person that I will mention</p>
<p>who used to be a fixture in Berkeley,</p>
<p>there was a professor named Albert Johnson</p>
<p>who taught African-American cinema.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Mukundha] Ah, very coo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through the African-American studies department.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And he was a really important figure I think,</p>
<p>in my understanding of the breadth,</p>
<p>again of motion pictures and television</p>
<p>from a specific perspective.</p>
<p>So all those experiences kind of came together</p>
<p>to really kind of prepare me, I think.</p>
<p>It provided the foundation and still provides the foundation</p>
<p>for the breadth of what I know storytelling to be in film.</p>
<ul>
<li>And there&rsquo;s so many wonderful themes that you&rsquo;ve outlined</li>
</ul>
<p>of storytelling, of just the intersection of representation,</p>
<p>of professional interests, artistic interests.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really fascinating that you&rsquo;re able to weave</p>
<p>all of that into sort of manifesting a career for yourself,</p>
<p>but also having such a really young experience,</p>
<p>as if it was like your playground,</p>
<p>sort of seeing these filmmakers</p>
<p>and discovering your own passion.</p>
<p>Thank you for that.</p>
<p>That was really interesting to sort of hear about</p>
<p>how passions kind of translate to career.</p>
<p>And then I guess from a film perspective,</p>
<p>you watch thousands of films as an executive.</p>
<p>What is that one stand out film for you</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s inspired you or that has made you smile?</p>
<p>Many people would say just a favorite film,</p>
<p>but I guess I&rsquo;d like to know a film that sort of changed</p>
<p>the trajectory of your life.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wow, that&rsquo;s a big question for someone like me</li>
</ul>
<p>that loves film.</p>
<p>I think it would be, they&rsquo;re just a kaleidoscope of films</p>
<p>that I think would.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Mukundha] Let&rsquo;s do three, yeah your top three.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh, I can&rsquo;t stop with three.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s Gotta Have It&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And I would say &ldquo;She&rsquo;s Gotta Have It&rdquo; as being kind of</p>
<p>the first of those, of the career of Spike Lee</p>
<p>that really kind of provided a whole different lens</p>
<p>on film and filmmaking for me.</p>
<p>And I think the interesting thing about that film is</p>
<p>it was the beginning of starting for a whole generation</p>
<p>of people who hadn&rsquo;t been a part</p>
<p>of the film industry necessarily.</p>
<p>It really kind of started the careers</p>
<p>of many different people.</p>
<p>So I think I would say that film for the film</p>
<p>and for the contribution,</p>
<p>but I would also cite it as an example of how</p>
<p>one person came into the film industry</p>
<p>and opened it up for a whole community of people</p>
<p>across the board that may not have seen themselves</p>
<p>doing film or being a part of the film industry</p>
<p>from every level.</p>
<p>My husband works at HBO and his first job</p>
<p>was working for Spike Lee.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Mukundha] Wow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And when you go through the credits of a Spike Lee film,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>you can see a number of people that have gone on</p>
<p>in their own kind of ways to do really interesting things.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an important one for me.</p>
<p>I love French movies.</p>
<p>I love &ldquo;Jules and Jim&rdquo; and &ldquo;400 Blows&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And as a child, the film I remember the most</p>
<p>was &ldquo;The Red Balloon&rdquo;, which was a real kind of</p>
<p>important film for me &lsquo;cause I remember it so vividly.</p>
<p>I mean I still love it to this day,</p>
<p>but part of the reason why I think it was so important</p>
<p>was because it&rsquo;s an exercise in visual storytelling</p>
<p>and just the power of visual storytelling</p>
<p>and the power of film to transport you to a different place.</p>
<p>And so that remains one of my favorite, favorite movies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sleeping Beauty&rdquo; is one of my favorite movies</p>
<p>for the beauty of the art direction.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s certainly one of my favorite animated movies,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s one of my favorite movies in general.</p>
<p>The drama of it and the (laughing).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Mukundha] Totally, there is a lot of drama there yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes and how the visuals kind of support</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>the dramatic filmmaking is really interesting to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apocalypse Now&rdquo; is one of my favorite movies</p>
<p>just for the scope of it and the ambition of it.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s very hard for me to name one.</p>
<ul>
<li>These are good, we&rsquo;re gonna make a playlist</li>
</ul>
<p>and share with everyone so thank you for these.</p>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<p>So now switching gears sort of,</p>
<p>from early days of Vanessa</p>
<p>to corporate executive leader Vanessa.</p>
<p>You most recently served as the president of Fox Family,</p>
<p>and you served as the president of Fox Animation,</p>
<p>where you oversaw development and production</p>
<p>of several films, several films</p>
<p>that Dean Harrison just outlined.</p>
<p>How has that transition been</p>
<p>from that traditional films model</p>
<p>to the world we live in now where everything is on demand</p>
<p>and everything is on streaming.</p>
<p>How has that sort of created an impact on your choices</p>
<p>as an executive, as a developer, and also as someone</p>
<p>who just is interested in this space?</p>
<ul>
<li>I think the common thread through each of the things</li>
</ul>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll go through a little bit of history</p>
<p>in terms of those various jobs and experiences.</p>
<p>First I always think it&rsquo;s important to say that</p>
<p>when I started in the film industry,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know anybody in the film industry.</p>
<p>So I went from Berkeley to getting a master&rsquo;s degree,</p>
<p>an MFA at UCLA.</p>
<p>And through UCLA I wound up as an intern at Fox</p>
<p>in the feature group and worked as an intern</p>
<p>and through being an intern became embedded</p>
<p>in the feature film group.</p>
<p>So my first kind of tour of executive work</p>
<p>was in live action.</p>
<p>So when I first started at Fox, I worked primarily</p>
<p>on family movies actually in live action.</p>
<p>So I worked on movies like &ldquo;Cheaper by the Dozen&rdquo;,</p>
<p>which it&rsquo;s interesting cause we did</p>
<p>Steve Martin in &ldquo;Cheaper by the Dozen&rdquo; in the &rsquo;90s.</p>
<p>And then now we&rsquo;re doing it from another perspective,</p>
<p>Kenya Barris is producing a &ldquo;Cheaper by the Dozen&rdquo;</p>
<p>for this generation on Disney+.</p>
<p>So that was like a full circle moment.</p>
<p>But when I initially started, I started in live action</p>
<p>working on family movies primarily.</p>
<p>And then I worked in live action for 10, some odd years,</p>
<p>I would say, probably give or take.</p>
<p>And then I work and shifted to animation.</p>
<p>And when Chris Meledandri left Fox to go run Illumination,</p>
<p>they asked me if I was interested</p>
<p>in running the animation feature business and I was.</p>
<p>So I learned and grew in that business for 10 years.</p>
<p>And then as you said, wanted to do something</p>
<p>that had a combination of the two,</p>
<p>which is what I started prior to coming to Disney.</p>
<p>And the thing that I think connects my experience</p>
<p>with all the work that I&rsquo;ve done in those various arenas,</p>
<p>first of all, I always loved family movies.</p>
<p>The notion of kind of creating all audience entertainment</p>
<p>was something that always kind of drove me,</p>
<p>whether it was my initial run in live action</p>
<p>or the animated movies it was all kind of my interest</p>
<p>in all audience family movies.</p>
<p>And I guess what I would say is whether it&rsquo;s streaming</p>
<p>or theatrical and that interest in that kind of</p>
<p>dogged pursuit of what the audience wants.</p>
<p>What audience are you trying to serve</p>
<p>I think is an important question that really kind of</p>
<p>services both streaming and theatrical.</p>
<p>So in this case, it&rsquo;s all audience movies.</p>
<p>And I actually think, because I&rsquo;m on the content side,</p>
<p>the things that we looked for</p>
<p>in a successful theatrical movie before streaming,</p>
<p>are still the things that we look for</p>
<p>in a successful movie for streaming.</p>
<p>You look for ideas that are clear, that can be executed</p>
<p>to a high level of quality.</p>
<p>You look for things that appeal,</p>
<p>again I mentioned all audience.</p>
<p>The way I think about things,</p>
<p>you look for things that even if they appeal to kids,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re also of interest to adults as well.</p>
<p>Again, in the animated movies,</p>
<p>you have to have an all audience model</p>
<p>to able to make those movies.</p>
<p>So I really do believe that as we think about kind of,</p>
<p>what content we create, the basic questions are the same.</p>
<p>Where there&rsquo;s huge opportunity though I think,</p>
<p>is just because everyone is making so much more content.</p>
<p>So the increase in volume allows you to do,</p>
<p>you just get more kind of opportunities.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been exciting because while</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking for many of the same things,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking for things that can break out,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking for stories that can connect</p>
<p>with wide audiences.</p>
<p>But at the same time, they&rsquo;re opportunities due to volume</p>
<p>where I think filmmakers and people that create content</p>
<p>have such a huge opportunity to tell stories</p>
<p>and to get their voice out there</p>
<p>in a way that we&rsquo;ve never seen before.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s just an exciting time to kind of be</p>
<p>in this business because of that.</p>
<p>But I also think it&rsquo;s that kind of attentiveness to quality,</p>
<p>attentiveness to consumer,</p>
<p>attentiveness to what audience are you trying to reach</p>
<p>and attentiveness to originality.</p>
<p>All of those things I think are just as important</p>
<p>in streaming as they are in theatrical.</p>
<ul>
<li>Makes total sense because at the end of the day,</li>
</ul>
<p>we&rsquo;re reaching the same people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just in a different format.</p>
<p>So totally. - Exactly.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Makes total sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But one of the things for people that (coughs) excuse me,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>are interested in content.</p>
<p>I look at kind of the slate of things</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve worked on recently.</p>
<p>And one exciting thing is the number of first-time directors</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been able to kind of give a shot to recently.</p>
<p>And that is something that I think</p>
<p>is a important development.</p>
<p>The fact that I see a lot of new voices</p>
<p>and a lot of first-time directors</p>
<p>and a lot of first-time writers getting an opportunity</p>
<p>on a big stage due to the need for content.</p>
<p>So I think in this evolutionary process</p>
<p>in terms of streaming, we&rsquo;re able to see the growth</p>
<p>of new filmmakers and new voices.</p>
<ul>
<li>And I think that&rsquo;s one of the most beautiful parts</li>
</ul>
<p>about streaming is to your point opportunity,</p>
<p>that opportunity may not have existed before.</p>
<p>And now we have a tremendous time and space</p>
<p>to give new filmmakers, new writers a chance</p>
<p>to explore something that they wouldn&rsquo;t have had</p>
<p>the opportunity to have before.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really great that someone like you</p>
<p>is behind the decision power to sort bestow that onto them.</p>
<p>I guess, like dealing with these types</p>
<p>of emerging filmmakers, what are some of the things</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re so excited about when you see them</p>
<p>come into the room to present a pitch to you or a concept?</p>
<p>Are there moments that you sometimes mentor them</p>
<p>or perhaps shared tidbits</p>
<p>of your industry experience with them?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes I mean, I think it&rsquo;s a back and forth.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think one of the important things is just to acknowledge.</p>
<p>Certainly I hope I have things to share with people</p>
<p>that are going through making movies on a studio scale</p>
<p>for the first time.</p>
<p>But the other thing is, I think we have things to learn</p>
<p>from new voices, always.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s a story that we haven&rsquo;t heard before,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a writer that may have written something</p>
<p>in another kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>A novelist writing a screenplay for the first time,</p>
<p>whatever it is.</p>
<p>The exciting thing about this job</p>
<p>and I think about the industry</p>
<p>and especially right now with streaming is just</p>
<p>these new connections that you&rsquo;re able to make</p>
<p>with again, fresh new voices.</p>
<p>And hopefully I&rsquo;m able to kind of provide</p>
<p>some new pathways and mentorship, but it goes both ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>Really important, thank you for sharing that.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you are at Haas, you&rsquo;re talking to a bunch</p>
<p>of business nerds and strategy nerds in the audience.</p>
<p>And you were a part of a very historical merger</p>
<p>a few years ago with Disney&rsquo;s acquisition of Fox.</p>
<p>For those folks in the room and in the audience</p>
<p>that have never experienced an M and A before,</p>
<p>what advice do you have from them from a cultural standpoint</p>
<p>or perhaps just a workforce standpoint?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obviously a massive shift in leadership</p>
<p>and strategy and vision.</p>
<p>What was it like for you on the inside?</p>
<p>And what advice do you have for those</p>
<p>who may have to undergo something similar</p>
<p>in the world we live in right now?</p>
<ul>
<li>That&rsquo;s an interesting question.</li>
</ul>
<p>My advice that I gave myself (laughing)</p>
<p>that I also gave the people around me</p>
<p>while we were going through that</p>
<p>was really to focus on your work.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re there for a reason.</p>
<p>If your mission is clear as far as why you&rsquo;re in your job</p>
<p>or why you&rsquo;re doing the work you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>my advice to them was that there are many things</p>
<p>that are gonna come and that are going to be a part</p>
<p>of something like that, that transition.</p>
<p>But the thing that you have control over</p>
<p>is your passion for your work and your passion</p>
<p>for your projects and your passion for discovering</p>
<p>new talent and bringing new talent in,</p>
<p>your interest in the world and going out and continuing</p>
<p>to meet with new filmmakers and meet with new writers.</p>
<p>And that is what I did and what I focused on.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve always believed that there&rsquo;s a lot of things</p>
<p>in the universe that just ebb and flow,</p>
<p>but the things that you&rsquo;re really, truly passionate about,</p>
<p>is what you have to kind of stay connected to.</p>
<p>So I love movies, I&rsquo;ve always loved movies.</p>
<p>The movies that I talked to you about, I still watch today.</p>
<p>And so I think whether it&rsquo;s going through</p>
<p>an experience like that,</p>
<p>or going through trying to figure out what your path is,</p>
<p>the thing that I have found most helpful for myself</p>
<p>is just to really stay connected to the root</p>
<p>and essential things that you feel strongly about</p>
<p>and passionate about that you love and enjoy.</p>
<p>And what are the reasons that you get into different fields</p>
<p>and to stay curious about those things</p>
<p>and keep discovering new things in whatever the arena is</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re interested in.</p>
<p>And that will be valuable both personally and professionally</p>
<p>and staying true to yourself is important too.</p>
<p>I think people</p>
<p>lead and people kind of grow in different ways,</p>
<p>but really figuring out what&rsquo;s important to you</p>
<p>and figuring out kind of what it is</p>
<p>that you bring to something.</p>
<p>Definitely in terms of the skills level,</p>
<p>but also in terms of kind of an intuitive level,</p>
<p>like what are the strengths that you bring</p>
<p>to an organization or you bring to a job</p>
<p>or you bring as a human being, those things are valuable.</p>
<p>And so acknowledging your value, staying curious,</p>
<p>staying connected to the things that you&rsquo;re passionate about</p>
<p>and really immersing yourselves in those things.</p>
<p>Really, that to me is just an important part</p>
<p>of whatever transitions one goes through</p>
<p>during the course of a professional career.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting because one of the transitions</p>
<p>that was most interesting for me in my profession</p>
<p>was going from live action to animation.</p>
<p>So when I decided to do that,</p>
<p>I had actually never made an animated movie before.</p>
<p>I had made family movies that had CG characters</p>
<p>and really were CG heavy.</p>
<p>So I knew that process in a different way</p>
<p>through live action, but I had actually never made</p>
<p>an animated movie before.</p>
<p>But what I did know was I knew how to tell</p>
<p>those types of stories.</p>
<p>And not only did I know how to tell those types of stories</p>
<p>but I love telling stories that appeal to kids,</p>
<p>but also adults liked.</p>
<p>And some of the stories that I was able to tell in animation</p>
<p>were stories that I had always grown up loving</p>
<p>and wanted to tell myself.</p>
<p>So that was an example of a transition that I went through</p>
<p>that could have been fraught with anxiety.</p>
<p>But I kinda leaned on the things</p>
<p>that I felt strongly about, that I loved.</p>
<p>And equally important and it&rsquo;s another aspect of</p>
<p>going to a new company is I also realized</p>
<p>I needed to learn what I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>If there were parts of the animation process</p>
<p>that I was unfamiliar with,</p>
<p>the most important thing that I did when I hit the ground</p>
<p>was to go to every single department</p>
<p>and get to know what they did and not be embarrassed</p>
<p>or self-conscious about learning.</p>
<p>And the notion of being able to learn,</p>
<p>learning while you lead, I think is something that</p>
<p>is a really exciting thing to be able to do.</p>
<p>Because it allows you to grow in different ways,</p>
<p>but you have to be confident that that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>So entering into a new organization is just the same,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s learning a new structure</p>
<p>or learning new strategy or learning whatever it is.</p>
<p>Going through that process and allowing yourself</p>
<p>to go through that process is really important.</p>
<p>And really understanding and valuing the people</p>
<p>that are there to get to know.</p>
<ul>
<li>I love that.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think there was a lot that you touched on</p>
<p>that is really relevant to sort of us</p>
<p>being the next business leaders of tomorrow,</p>
<p>just in terms of identity, connection, commitment, purpose.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really nice that you were able to sort of show us</p>
<p>how those are all intricately connected</p>
<p>and sort of taking a part of your own leadership style.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a really popular course here at Haas</p>
<p>called Power in Politics, where we really think about</p>
<p>both the topics and sort of how they&rsquo;re closely correlated.</p>
<p>And one of the strong things that we&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>is in the principles of persuasion and influence,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s liking, authority, commitment, social proof,</p>
<p>reciprocity and scarcity.</p>
<p>These are sort of the core tenants</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve learned about persuasion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious as a leader of yourself</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re managing large complex teams,</p>
<p>sort of executing on a really interesting,</p>
<p>get creative outcome, what are some of the styles</p>
<p>of influence that you like to lead</p>
<p>in these types of organizations</p>
<p>and what has worked for you in your career?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, I think curiosity is certainly a big one.</li>
</ul>
<p>And I touched upon that in the last question.</p>
<p>But I also think remembering that organizations</p>
<p>are made up of people and that sounds kind of obvious,</p>
<p>but for me really the value of kind of understanding people</p>
<p>and connecting with people and listening to people</p>
<p>is really, really critical.</p>
<p>And I think that places can be complex</p>
<p>in terms of how they&rsquo;re structured</p>
<p>or strategy can be complex.</p>
<p>But it always starts with me from people</p>
<p>and listening to people and understanding what they do,</p>
<p>what they value, what they think their job is,</p>
<p>what their passion is, what their strengths are,</p>
<p>what their weaknesses are.</p>
<p>So being really focused on the people</p>
<p>within an organization, I think is really important.</p>
<p>The other side to that I think is just the notion</p>
<p>that you have to keep learning and you have to keep growing</p>
<p>and you have to keep learning from the people</p>
<p>who are around you.</p>
<p>And creating structures and creating opportunities</p>
<p>for people to connect and learn from each other</p>
<p>and creating environments where that&rsquo;s not only okay,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an important part of how organizations grow</p>
<p>and stay relevant, I think is really important.</p>
<p>I would say admitting what you don&rsquo;t know is important,</p>
<p>asking questions is important.</p>
<p>And I think because we&rsquo;re in such</p>
<p>a dynamic environment right now,</p>
<p>the notion of learning being a constant thing I think,</p>
<p>is really important to acknowledge</p>
<p>and being able to really kind of wrap your arms</p>
<p>around things very quickly,</p>
<p>that you need to figure out and understand.</p>
<p>So I think one of the interesting parts</p>
<p>about the environment that we&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>that you guys will go out and lead</p>
<p>is just how dynamic it is.</p>
<p>And to me, that&rsquo;s very exciting.</p>
<p>I think throughout the course of one&rsquo;s life,</p>
<p>they will do so many different things,</p>
<p>so many more things than generations have done before now</p>
<p>until just kind of staying nimble and being able</p>
<p>to kind of react to things with curiosity and passion</p>
<p>in real time is both exciting and can be very daunting.</p>
<p>But I think for me staying curious and</p>
<p>trying to stay centered also,</p>
<p>I think is really important.</p>
<ul>
<li>And I guess even thinking about staying centered,</li>
</ul>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of appreciation for sort of bringing</p>
<p>your whole self to work and that sort of</p>
<p>keeps people grounded.</p>
<p>And as a black female and a leader at a massive company,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious to hear how you sort of bring</p>
<p>that whole core identity to work every day.</p>
<p>And what sort of elements do you look for to make sure</p>
<p>you feel supported in every room</p>
<p>and every position that you assume.</p>
<p>What are the factors that make you feel supported</p>
<p>and how do you sort of navigate that intricacy</p>
<p>while bringing your whole self to work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Well it&rsquo;s interesting because I really thank my parents</li>
</ul>
<p>(laughing) first and foremost.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Mukundha] (indistinct) yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My father was I think one of the first African-American</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>tenured physics professor at Cal.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Mukundha] Wow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And so all throughout growing up,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I learned what it meant to kind of often</p>
<p>be the only one in a professional environment</p>
<p>in terms of somebody that looked like us.</p>
<p>And the thing that I learned from him from a very early age</p>
<p>was the importance of just your own self worth,</p>
<p>of acknowledging your own self-worth</p>
<p>and acknowledging your own value and never doubting that.</p>
<p>And never letting an experience or a room</p>
<p>or a person shake that.</p>
<p>And so that is something that I really try to impart</p>
<p>to people that I really try to live by.</p>
<p>And I just think it&rsquo;s important to kind of recognize</p>
<p>what your own value is and what your own self worth is.</p>
<p>When you are able to kind of do that,</p>
<p>and I was blessed with someone for whom</p>
<p>that was very, very important</p>
<p>and important for reason.</p>
<p>I mean my father had come from segregated Virginia</p>
<p>to get a PhD at Catholic University</p>
<p>because it was the only place at that time in his area</p>
<p>that allowed black students to study really.</p>
<p>From him making that journey to being a professor at Cal,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like there wasn&rsquo;t anything I did as far as</p>
<p>things that I might have worried about</p>
<p>or felt self-conscious about, just paled in comparison.</p>
<p>So the thing that I learned and listened to</p>
<p>from that experience that he had had</p>
<p>was just the value of being able to know your own value</p>
<p>to education as being a bedrock and a backbone for things.</p>
<p>And preparation so that when you lead or walk into a room,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a foundation that you have for yourself</p>
<p>that you always can rely upon.</p>
<p>And so when I talk to other people about,</p>
<p>maybe being underrepresented in different workplaces</p>
<p>or communities, I think that&rsquo;s where I start.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that answers the que&hellip;</p>
<p>Then the other thing I just think is</p>
<p>when you come to something with a different perspective</p>
<p>or a unique perspective, all of us have unique perspectives,</p>
<p>whatever that is.</p>
<p>But when you come to, you talk about being your whole self,</p>
<p>like being your whole self has value,</p>
<p>it has value in companies.</p>
<p>It has value in terms of consumer facing companies,</p>
<p>because you bring a perspective that people need to hear.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Totally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So for me, it&rsquo;s always been important to,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>especially if I&rsquo;m the only one in a room,</p>
<p>I feel that it&rsquo;s important for me to speak up</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve always felt that way.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not always been easy as I think,</p>
<p>I started at Fox as an intern, like as a real intern.</p>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<p>And I was able early on in the program that I was in</p>
<p>to sit at the table with the chairman and the president</p>
<p>and all those people.</p>
<p>But very early on I realized that it was,</p>
<p>even as a intern that my voice had meaning,</p>
<p>and that it was important for me to find ways</p>
<p>to express myself or else why was I there?</p>
<p>And I continue to kind of operate from that perspective.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you for that affirmation and that encouragement</li>
</ul>
<p>to just be core to your identity and to yourself,</p>
<p>and to have that confidence in any space you occupy.</p>
<p>So we really appreciate that.</p>
<p>Thank you, Vanessa.</p>
<p>I know we&rsquo;re very close to time so I wanted to</p>
<p>pass it back to Dean Harrison for some audience Q and A.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you, thank you so much.</li>
</ul>
<p>That was such an amazing conversation</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just so struck by the importance of</p>
<p>some of the principles that we really support at Haas</p>
<p>in particular one of our defining leadership principles</p>
<p>is confidence without attitude.</p>
<p>And another one is students always,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve really emphasized the importance</p>
<p>of always learning and being open and curious.</p>
<p>And that really resonates, I&rsquo;m sure,</p>
<p>with many who are listening.</p>
<p>The first audience question,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re okay with that Vanessa is from Kalil.</p>
<p>The question is what would you recommend for someone</p>
<p>who wants to work at Walt Disney Studio someday?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, I would say if you&rsquo;re where you are</li>
</ul>
<p>at this tremendous business school,</p>
<p>I mean (laughing) you&rsquo;ve got a leg up.</p>
<p>I think the first thing is identifying</p>
<p>and learning about what part of the company</p>
<p>someone would be interested in.</p>
<p>Companies like Disney or Netflix or whatever company,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s such a broad range of arenas to choose from</p>
<p>in terms of what you&rsquo;re interested in.</p>
<p>So the first thing I recommend is for people</p>
<p>to really nail down what they&rsquo;re interested in.</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s what they think it is now</p>
<p>and it may change later, knowing what department</p>
<p>or what arena or even what person</p>
<p>you might wanna work with,</p>
<p>provides like a specificity of path,</p>
<p>which I think is really important for the film industry.</p>
<p>And then the second thing I would say is learning</p>
<p>all you can about whatever department that is.</p>
<p>When I first started working in the film industry,</p>
<p>one of the things that I did was I really researched</p>
<p>the companies that I was interested in</p>
<p>and that research encompassed all the different divisions,</p>
<p>but also the different executives themselves.</p>
<p>And being able to try to kind of research the executives</p>
<p>and then try to figure out who it was</p>
<p>that I would like to most be connected with,</p>
<p>even coming out of film school.</p>
<p>At the time, I did not end up directly working for her,</p>
<p>but there was a executive named Stephanie Elaine at Columbia</p>
<p>who had been responsible for a number of movies</p>
<p>that I loved, like &ldquo;Boyz n the Hood&rdquo;</p>
<p>and a number of films that had really</p>
<p>groundbreaking first-time filmmakers.</p>
<p>And through my just research,</p>
<p>I found a path to her as out of film school.</p>
<p>And that path actually led me</p>
<p>to be able to work at Columbia,</p>
<p>which then was kind of another piece in the entree</p>
<p>into becoming an intern later at Fox.</p>
<p>So just doing that research to really, really</p>
<p>kind of micro focus on where you want to be</p>
<p>so that you can then figure out who you need to get to</p>
<p>and how to put it together, I think is really important.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you for that.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m so struck by how important self knowledge</p>
<p>and understanding where your passions are</p>
<p>and where you wanna direct those,</p>
<p>how important that&rsquo;s been for you.</p>
<p>We have another question here from Mark.</p>
<p>The question is four-quadrant movies</p>
<p>are the most financially viable option for theaters</p>
<p>yet various (indistinct) perform well via streaming.</p>
<p>Has that been influencing content strategy at Disney+.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you repeat the question?</li>
</ul>
<p>&lsquo;Cause I could hear the beginning,</p>
<p>but I couldn&rsquo;t hear the second part.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, so the question it said,</li>
</ul>
<p>four quadrant movies are the most financially</p>
<p>viable options for theaters yet various types</p>
<p>perform well in streaming.</p>
<p>Has that been influencing content strategy at Disney+?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, I think one of the things that we kind of alluded to</li>
</ul>
<p>was just how volume can impact content</p>
<p>and content selection.</p>
<p>And so when I look at the slate at least for my group</p>
<p>that I have, it&rsquo;s very diverse in all ways.</p>
<p>And part of that diversity is in the types of movies</p>
<p>that we have made.</p>
<p>So for a big kind of temple all audience movie,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one in which I would consider an all audience play,</p>
<p>where you wanna try to get from one to a hundred.</p>
<p>But then because there&rsquo;s such a ability to connect</p>
<p>with the audience in different ways via streaming,</p>
<p>you can take chances on smaller films as well</p>
<p>and on midsize movies also.</p>
<p>So strategically because of the volume,</p>
<p>because of the just demographic diversity in all ways</p>
<p>of your audience, it allows you to make broader</p>
<p>kind of content selections.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>So here we have a really interesting question from Andy.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your prediction for the media industry</p>
<p>in the next five years?</p>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<ul>
<li>I have no prediction.</li>
</ul>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<p>The thing I can tell you is I think we are living</p>
<p>in a very exciting dynamic evolutionary kind of time.</p>
<p>And I think for people that are coming out</p>
<p>of business school or film school or whatever it is</p>
<p>and have the opportunity to work in the media business,</p>
<p>I actually think the opportunities are unlimited.</p>
<p>And I think they&rsquo;re gonna be, certainly my arena is content.</p>
<p>And certainly in content there going to be</p>
<p>so many different opportunities as there are right now.</p>
<p>But also in terms of expertise in terms of distribution</p>
<p>and marketing and audience analysis.</p>
<p>All of those things are going to have growth</p>
<p>as they are now.</p>
<p>But in terms of predicting exactly</p>
<p>what the media landscape looks like,</p>
<p>that would be crazy for me.</p>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<ul>
<li>Well thank you so much, Vanessa.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re at time and I really, really wanna thank you</p>
<p>for taking this time to speak to us.</p>
<p>I wanna thank Mukundha who&rsquo;s played such an important role</p>
<p>in making it possible for us to have you at Berkeley.</p>
<p>We are just so thrilled that such an incredible role model</p>
<p>like you has come to Haas and is a Berkeley Cal grad.</p>
<p>So thank you again and go Bears.</p>
<ul>
<li>No, thank you and I appreciate it.</li>
</ul>
<p>And yes, you will see me in person one day.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sounds wonderful, thank you.</li>
</ul>
