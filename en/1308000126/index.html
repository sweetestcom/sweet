    <p>Check out you have a really long nose hair. Thank you on your on your left this one here this side</p>
<p>Yeah, okay. Hold on. You see it Nick you see it see that you can see it. Take care of it every show</p>
<p>We have this issue every show. He&rsquo;s got all this like I&rsquo;m getting old man hairs. I feel like sex</p>
<p>You gotta get a grooming tool. I am tired of treasure hunting. I mean for what he is a lawnmower. It&rsquo;s Kate makes one</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get it. Yeah, just look in the mirror. Can you come over on the way to Parker Freeburg and help me man?</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re not coming to poker don&rsquo;t come to poker you said if I manscape can I come to</p>
<p>Okay, so Jake out you&rsquo;re gonna be a participant today</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s greatest moderator is taking a week off to allow his voice to recoup to recover to see us</p>
<p>So he can come back blaring with his usual</p>
<p>mid-sentence interruptions and</p>
<p>Excellent moderating tactics next week. We with his foghorn leghorn moderation</p>
<p>We are gonna we are gonna miss you at the moderation. Welcome to the top 20 sacks</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome. Welcome to the top 20 podcasts in the world. Okay. Well, hold on who should be thinking whom?</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve been doing this for 10 years. I walk in here off the street all of a sudden. We&rsquo;re top 20</p>
<p>Yeah, let me explain something</p>
<p>I created with my guys and gadget</p>
<p>Okay, top five magazine in the world</p>
<p>Then I do a podcast with you three idiots and all of a sudden I drop down to top 20 in this medium</p>
<p>So drop, what are you talking about? Yeah, exactly a drop. This has been a be tested</p>
<p>No, I mean this we can start up is they don&rsquo;t embarrass you but look at twist ratings compared to ours</p>
<p>This we can start it&rsquo;s a bout startups</p>
<p>It is a niche audience my design and it&rsquo;s the number one startup podcast in the world</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you wanted this show to be I didn&rsquo;t this show is about all topics</p>
<p>All time every time we try to talk politics. You&rsquo;re like, it&rsquo;s too much politics axe. I think you&rsquo;re talking about free bird</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re talking about free bird. Let&rsquo;s focus on narrow</p>
<p>Legalistic issues true you we had this discussion sacks and I said we should always do the top story of the week</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s politics and now you&rsquo;re taking credit for my insight about McLaughlin group</p>
<p>I saw you on some pod. Who was it? I</p>
<p>Absolutely designed this potter. I&rsquo;m McLaughlin the fact</p>
<p>Group, I&rsquo;m said McLaughlin group. Okay, it&rsquo;s possible for two people to have the same idea sacks</p>
<p>We both grew up on McLaughlin group. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re both can tankers assholes moderator intervention cut it out</p>
<p>No one is individually responsible for this podcast. It was Tim Ferriss. Yeah, Tim Ferriss. Here&rsquo;s what happened</p>
<p>So I was on YouTube and you know, I&rsquo;m not gonna watch some two-hour like podcast with J. Cal, of course, but</p>
<p>Video is called the origin of the all-in podcast. I can&rsquo;t stand what he don&rsquo;t got here. We can&rsquo;t stand what he does that</p>
<p>Yeah, so I&rsquo;m like, okay</p>
<p>Partnership agreement. He said here&rsquo;s the the party line and J. Cal will not stick with ya</p>
<p>Going to recreate this I got to see this alternative reality that J. Cal&rsquo;s trying to create about the origin of the all-in podcast</p>
<p>I wrote I wrote in our legal history. Yes, and I changed</p>
<p>No, the origin story that you signed up to are you saying you change the origin story?</p>
<p>Remains the same. No, it doesn&rsquo;t you call me after CMB&rsquo;s the origin story that he told Tim Ferriss</p>
<p>Which is like a 10-minute story of how he created the whole thing</p>
<p>The concept was his it was based on McLaughlin group</p>
<p>Concept is now obviously by default how I moderate the program is by my design</p>
<p>Yes, you didn&rsquo;t come up with this concept your chagrin. Of course. I did. No, of course. I did not design my moderation</p>
<p>First one who said we should record us having conversations at the poker table. No</p>
<p>That idea came from him, right? That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called the all-in pod</p>
<p>No</p>
<p>I came up with the name all-in number one</p>
<p>Number two was his idea to tape a pod because he came out of CBC. Anyway, who cares the pods here. It&rsquo;s successful</p>
<p>Why do you keep going on podcast telling everyone that you&rsquo;re the mastermind of the all-in pod?</p>
<p>People are saying you Jake have the game other podcasters</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explain to you other podcasters are in awe of my ability to moderate you three malcontents</p>
<p>You did not have the idea for the foursome based on McLaughlin group that happened that happened</p>
<p>Spontaneously as a result of the fact that no Freeberg was I think the first guest I was the second guest then we did the</p>
<p>Four of us together. Okay, that was</p>
<p>That worked out, okay fine the way the way I moderate this is of note to the world&rsquo;s greatest podcasters</p>
<p>They want to know Jake out. How do you take three?</p>
<p>misanthropic malcontents</p>
<p>And make them actually palatable to the world and I say, you know what because I am the world&rsquo;s greatest moderator</p>
<p>And someone like Tim Ferriss wants to know is me. Excuse me. What makes me a misanthropic malcontent?</p>
<p>Exactly your behavior and worldview</p>
<p>What is it? What is my behavior? And what is my worldview your absolute contempt for humanity?</p>
<p>Everybody</p>
<p>No, amazing. I&rsquo;m it&rsquo;s a joke. It&rsquo;s called a job. It&rsquo;s called a joke</p>
<p>Now you set him off Jake out you really that hurt you should apologize</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called a joke, I think you guys are wonderful. I think you guys are one</p>
<p>Well, I mean I may be misanthropic but malcontent. I&rsquo;m not no sacks and free burger than Malcolm. That&rsquo;s for sure</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty damn happy. You&rsquo;re happy the last descriptor anybody who knows you would ascribe to Friedberg was happy</p>
<p>No, I would say no. I think he&rsquo;s happy. He&rsquo;s anxious, but he&rsquo;s happy. Yeah, he&rsquo;s anxious, but happy. Did you see the roast?</p>
<p>That was not a happy man. That was tearing you up. That was funny</p>
<p>That was</p>
<p>Yeah, that was venting he was yeah, that was rage</p>
<p>Rage, no, I think I think when free work tries to be funny it comes out kind of mean</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe that&rsquo;s just a little bit of rage</p>
<p>The only person that sets me off into making me unhappy is you Jay Cal</p>
<p>Go to therapy or we could keep recording this podcast every week</p>
<p>Which is cheaper. I think it&rsquo;s cheaper for us to just record the pod</p>
<p>You know what? I for one am thankful to whoever gave you whatever sickness you have that causes you to not be able to talk</p>
<p>This week. Okay, great. Yeah, you&rsquo;re talking a lot for a guy who can&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>Coming at me. I&rsquo;m sick. Be nice to me while we&rsquo;re talking about all kinds of random stuff</p>
<p>The number two thing that I see in the what&rsquo;s happening tab on Twitter right now is how Ron DeSantis is getting blasted</p>
<p>for banning AP African American Studies because he thinks</p>
<p>It falls under the stop woke act. That&rsquo;s this the headlines. It&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>Absolutely nuclear on Twitter right now</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some of the quotes shocking Ron DeSantis has banned all caps the teaching of AP African American Studies in Florida</p>
<p>Florida has gone from don&rsquo;t say gay to don&rsquo;t say black next tweet</p>
<p>Claiming it violates the stop woke act and has no educational value</p>
<p>Florida governor Ron DeSantis has banned AP African American Studies from schools. Let me make a prediction right now</p>
<p>This will all redoubts his advantage</p>
<p>The same people who said that he was death Santas for basically not instituting kovat lockdowns</p>
<p>He was proven correct</p>
<p>Then they said that this bill that prohibited the teaching of gender fluidity to five-year-olds</p>
<p>They claim try to claim that was a don&rsquo;t say gay bill</p>
<p>70% of Florida supports that that redoubts his advantage. I don&rsquo;t know the story behind this particular course</p>
<p>But if the question is whether CRT, it&rsquo;s gonna be funded by the state and he&rsquo;s preventing that again</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ll be a 70% popular issue. So let&rsquo;s just wait and see how this plays out fair enough</p>
<p>I just want to claim that my spread trade maybe it&rsquo;s tough to be the leader in</p>
<p>The Republican nomination process in January of 2022. It&rsquo;s starting</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>In either party, but I&rsquo;d say the bigger threat to the Santas is there&rsquo;s a new poll</p>
<p>Where Trump came out on top so Trump&rsquo;s still his biggest threat. Yeah, so unfortunately Jay Cobb may be right that</p>
<p>the Republicans may do something stupid here and</p>
<p>Nominate a candidate who&rsquo;s I think less electable than to Santa&rsquo;s actually don&rsquo;t take any joy in it</p>
<p>I actually I think Nikki Haley&rsquo;s gonna come out of nowhere and win this thing. Well, it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>I you know, I really would like to see some non-political</p>
<p>Non-career politicians run for office the Bloomberg, you know sort of category. It feels like these career politicians</p>
<p>Are just really really bad at executing and I&rsquo;m bad, you know, yeah who likes Nikki Haley who?</p>
<p>Democrats Democrats guys. Why why do we like her? I&rsquo;m an independent rising. She&rsquo;s Polaroid</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a safe establishment Republican who basically is not gonna put up any fierce resistance to what the Davos crowd</p>
<p>Wants to do. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true. I think she was pretty she&rsquo;s not gonna win the Republican nomination</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think she cares about Davos people to save her life</p>
<p>I think that she is a moderate reasonable person who had to govern in a southern state and got everybody on board</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s pretty crazy. She&rsquo;s a pro-life person who negotiated a</p>
<p>20-week support for abortion in</p>
<p>2014 so this is a person that knows how to get stuff done</p>
<p>South Carolina happens to be the state that&rsquo;s actually at the leading edge of climate transition</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s had more jobs and more money come in into a southern red state of</p>
<p>People and companies willing to build for climate change than any other state in the country</p>
<p>So you like her as I know she&rsquo;s just she&rsquo;s so I just think that she&rsquo;s actually like normal and sane and not an idiot</p>
<p>Would you vote for her? Absolutely over Biden? Absolutely. Absolutely</p>
<p>Interesting sad a percent. Yeah. Look if you&rsquo;re really willing to vote for her, that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>I think really I would she&rsquo;s you know, she&rsquo;s young her parents had a small business. She was a small business person</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough to be a winner at all of those levels and she managed to do it</p>
<p>I mean, how do you as a brown woman get elected to governor of South Carolina and do a lot of really good things?</p>
<p>Good stuff. That&rsquo;s kind of tough. Yeah, so I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>I think she deserves a close look and she&rsquo;s the only one that didn&rsquo;t kowtow to Trump</p>
<p>She was able to play the game manipulate him get him to be on her side and then still told him to go pounce in</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty cool. Well, a lot of a lot of governors managed to do that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying I&rsquo;m saying she got she she went to the United Nations. She did what she needed to do there</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an important role at that time</p>
<p>Actually Nikki Haley expressly has said she will not run if Trump runs so she&rsquo;s kowtow to Trump, too</p>
<p>She wanted to be his VP, right? Like she was trying to shank Pence, right? That was her plan</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a smart strategy</p>
<p>but she said she will not run against Trump the main alternative to Trump in the Republican Party is to Santa&rsquo;s and then I&rsquo;d say</p>
<p>The number three in the Republican Party after Trump into Santa&rsquo;s Glenn Youngkin right now</p>
<p>Huh based on what metrics?</p>
<p>Based on interest in the party and you know, I&rsquo;ve talked to people and I think the polling will eventually reflect this</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very talented Jake out. You talk about appealing to independence. He was able to win a blue state</p>
<p>Remember Virginia went for Biden by 10 points and Youngkin was able to win that state if you ever listen to him campaign</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a very talented campaigner. I think Youngkin is very very talented</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, and I think that he would be an extremely credible candidate for president</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing that Youngkin will get destroyed on is he&rsquo;s literally not been in the job for but for a few, you know</p>
<p>18 months so he hasn&rsquo;t done anything and I think that if it does boil down now it may not matter</p>
<p>Right because look Obama was a senator for two years or whatever, right? So it may not matter but to the extent that</p>
<p>Republicans demand some bona fides. I think that you&rsquo;ll see Trump and DeSantis attack Youngkin more viciously in</p>
<p>a presidential primary than they attack</p>
<p>Haley on that dimension of you have no experience and it&rsquo;ll be hard for him to back it up just one final point</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;ll man the other side. That&rsquo;s final final point. We got it</p>
<p>We got to get started final point Virginia has this wonky one-term term limit on governors. So</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s got no choice but to make a play in</p>
<p>2024 because he&rsquo;s gonna be termed out. Anyway, okay J Cal as a lifelong independent who&rsquo;s only ever voted Democrat</p>
<p>Which of these</p>
<p>Republican to be clear</p>
<p>One time he was 12, yeah, no, I voted three times. Yeah, you like playing that young kid three times I voted Republican I</p>
<p>Would like somebody who&rsquo;s younger and actually I&rsquo;ve been quite influenced by</p>
<p>Your framing of a person who can control the budget and reduce spending because I do think it&rsquo;s kind of the most existential</p>
<p>Risk we have right now. So I might be moving to more of a single</p>
<p>Issue vote for this presidential election. I love that issue. I love that about you</p>
<p>Which is I just think like we have to have somebody younger</p>
<p>Who is not going to bankrupt the company and the more these candidates talk about social issues and not economic ones</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a tell that they&rsquo;re not the right person for the job</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m personally at is like this country has a serious</p>
<p>financial existential</p>
<p>Crisis on its hands and we have to get off social issues and we have to get on to financial</p>
<p>Points, so I assume then you support the Republicans in this looming budget showdown. I actually do. Yes</p>
<p>I do think we should hold the line on</p>
<p>Spending so you support the Republicans?</p>
<p>Voting no on raising the debt ceiling. Yeah, I actually do</p>
<p>I think we should start pumping the brakes on spending and I do think the Tea Party</p>
<p>Yeah, no, that doesn&rsquo;t mean I like those candidates they&rsquo;re kind of whack jobs actually but you think George Santos is a whack job</p>
<p>Listen, it&rsquo;s the Republican Party has turned into some crazy Howard Stern whack pack</p>
<p>Sacks is appalled by it. He just can&rsquo;t some elements of both parties look that way</p>
<p>Would you would you ever invite tomorrow Santos to your house? Who would you invite? Okay, actually</p>
<p>Who would you be</p>
<p>Not a fundraising dinner, but just invite to the house you can pick between two people. Oh, no, Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez or George Campos</p>
<p>Who would you pick? Oh, yes. See what do you think? Sure. I&rsquo;d rather probably</p>
<p>Meet and talk to AOC, of course, because it would be interesting. Don&rsquo;t want to fundraise for her. No, but no</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not asking fundraising who let in the door front door unlock the front door for unlock</p>
<p>AOC</p>
<p>George would you not even return the email if he said David I&rsquo;m in town</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t let him in my house for dinner. Don&rsquo;t let</p>
<p>Yeah, he might he might steal the silverware or something</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s so nuts</p>
<p>Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. We got to get started as your moderator. I&rsquo;m gonna try and keep us on track. Good luck</p>
<p>Yeah, no, look, it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s an energetic day. I appreciate I appreciate my co-hosts and their enthusiasm</p>
<p>Enough recognition for supporting the Republicans in this budget showdown. I mean, I&rsquo;m like blown away by this. I think it&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s great as you guys know just to restate. It&rsquo;s my number one concern on earth today</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>And I think that the importance of this topic</p>
<p>Really needs to kind of rise above politics of all the things you said Freeberg in the last like six months on this program</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the one thing that stuck with me and it&rsquo;s one thing that has like actually now</p>
<p>I realize is the most important thing for this country is fiscal responsibility</p>
<p>austerity measures and looking at how we&rsquo;re spending money and looking at immigration and looking at economic velocity and</p>
<p>employment and</p>
<p>Competing on the world stage with a solid balance sheet is the balance sheet is how you compete</p>
<p>The balance sheet is how you compete. I think it rises above social issues and it rises above climate change</p>
<p>You you cannot address climate change or social issues or infrastructure or unemployment</p>
<p>Unless we have the ability to operate as a country over the long term and have the ability</p>
<p>To have the continuing credit of the United States dollar and that&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s so important free break</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m dealing this with with startups</p>
<p>I have right now and I tell them the balance sheet is how you compete</p>
<p>If your balance sheet is flipped upside down and you&rsquo;re gonna be out of business in nine months</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not competing with these two other companies in your sector</p>
<p>you have to have a strong balance sheet take the austerity measures make the cuts and</p>
<p>Then compete with a strong balance sheet</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so obvious this country&rsquo;s balance sheet is getting flipped upside down and we are gonna have so many</p>
<p>Yeah, very complex second and third order effects with the interest payments</p>
<p>if you value austerity, if you value austerity, if you look back in history, and you actually ask of the</p>
<p>Prime ministers or presidents of various countries particularly first world countries that have actually had an impact in implementing austerity</p>
<p>You know what the unifying thing that I can say is women do a much better job than men</p>
<p>Okay, you want austerity you&rsquo;re better off with it with Margaret Thatcher. Margaret Thatcher would then with a dude</p>
<p>aka Nikki Haley</p>
<p>Interstate</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very hard position to be in as a politician because you have to position</p>
<p>Your objective as one of taking things away and the primary way to get elected in a democracy</p>
<p>Just like in junior high when you run for president of the junior high class is I&rsquo;m gonna make the vending machines free</p>
<p>You get elected and when you run in politics</p>
<p>You always promise your constituents what they&rsquo;re gonna get that they don&rsquo;t have today and that&rsquo;s the model for getting elected</p>
<p>Whatever the issue is of the day, whatever the issue de jure to decade whatever</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about what I&rsquo;m gonna give you that you don&rsquo;t have today</p>
<p>And so to flip that conversation around we all have to sacrifice together for the long-term</p>
<p>Viability of our economic prosperity. We need to do we need to give up the following things</p>
<p>That is a very hard platform to running on</p>
<p>When someone on the other side of the podium on the other side of the stage is saying I&rsquo;m gonna give you these 10 things</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very hard to get like it and that&rsquo;s why democracies ultimately eat themselves and I forgot who said it</p>
<p>But ultimately all democracies end up realizing they can vote themselves all the money and then you have this big cycle</p>
<p>Republicans did the most brilliant thing ever recently. They moved from stop the steal to stop the spend. This is a genius</p>
<p>Thing they stumbled into nobody wants to hear them talking about the election being stolen</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s complete nonsense, but stop the spend we all understand that everybody is seeing it in their own personal balance sheets</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re seeing it in their companies. They&rsquo;re seeing it in their families. They&rsquo;re seeing it with their mortgage payment</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re looking at their you know college tuition bills. They&rsquo;re looking at their</p>
<p>Car payments going from four hundred to seven hundred dollars and they&rsquo;re seeing what variable interest does we have variable interest debt?</p>
<p>This stuff is gonna skyrocket</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s Elon&rsquo;s payments for Twitter or your payments for your mortgage or our country&rsquo;s payments for our debt. We have to stop the spend</p>
<p>Effective interest rates. Yes. Yeah, but guys, let&rsquo;s just continue the conversation and</p>
<p>Talk a little bit about this World Economic Forum</p>
<p>Gathering that that took place in Davos. I know you guys wanted to talk about it this week</p>
<p>Okay, so by Jake Al&rsquo;s intellectual honesty, I&rsquo;m like blowing away right now cuz he&rsquo;s sick. Okay, so look</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m trying to get the best out of you sex</p>
<p>The budget conversation is an important one as it relates also to the global economy and growth</p>
<p>So Davos took place, you know over this past week just so everyone knows and I remember</p>
<p>You know working at Google</p>
<p>2004 I remember like how exciting it was for the executives to kind of start to transition into the Davos stage</p>
<p>It became this moment where you&rsquo;re kind of finally on the world stage</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an exciting moment for CEOs for world leaders for global economists to get together</p>
<p>talk about the state of the global economy where the world is headed what we can and should be doing about it and</p>
<p>Davos is also this</p>
<p>This place of pride and prestige for being invited and being a part of the party the global</p>
<p>Elite party as some people are now calling it and that&rsquo;s what I think is the important conversation</p>
<p>Is that the World Economic Forum gathering in Davos has recently been cast as this gathering of the global elites</p>
<p>Those who are trying to take control and run the world as they see fit and sex</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love your point of view on how that transition has happened because one of the important ways that the Davos</p>
<p>Gathering has been cast in the World Economic Forum has been cast is in the negative light of being globalists and</p>
<p>globalism has had a really important role in driving global economic growth and prosperity and</p>
<p>It has had these adverse effects in the US as we&rsquo;ve seen with wealth inequality loss of jobs offshoring</p>
<p>Gutting of industries and so on. I think that there&rsquo;s a really important way that Davos has been politicized</p>
<p>But the risk of that is significant because if we do</p>
<p>Lean into this globalist notion and say it&rsquo;s all about elites trying to take control of our world and we all become</p>
<p>Isolationists that countries around the world can suffer deeply from the economic consequences of that shift</p>
<p>So maybe sacks you can kick this off and especially in light of our</p>
<p>Conversation today about the need for economic growth and the reduction of global debt to support, you know</p>
<p>a more prosperous world in the future</p>
<p>This idea that right now we&rsquo;re talking about Davos and the World Economic Forum as a gathering of global elites and maybe sacks you can</p>
<p>Kind of give us the history and the point of view on how that positionings come about</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a meeting of global business and government leaders. So they are the elites</p>
<p>I mean you add them all together and they do control a substantial portion of the world economy and most of the</p>
<p>You know nations with the biggest economies</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no question</p>
<p>These are some of the most important people in the world a bunch of the articles coming out of Davos</p>
<p>Reported the somber mood and tone of the conference the level of anxiety and worry was very high and I think that</p>
<p>For a brief moment</p>
<p>It looked like these people were staring in the mirror and realizing that their management of the global economy over the last couple of decades</p>
<p>Has been a bit of a disaster</p>
<p>I mean you do have ruinous deficits and debts piling up in</p>
<p>But the US and across the world something like 350 percent</p>
<p>Debt to GDP globally, so we&rsquo;ve talked about that</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got this war in Ukraine that I and many people around the world think was easily avoidable and was a diplomatic failure</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re coming off of two years of badly botched kovat</p>
<p>Mismanagement where the governments the world pursued a horrible policy on kovat and made everything worse. You&rsquo;ve got decades of energy policy</p>
<p>Promoted by the World Economic Forum where they want to get people off</p>
<p>Fossil fuels and natural gas and get them on to</p>
<p>Less dense less reliable energy including promoting things like organic farming in Sri Lanka</p>
<p>Which we talk on the show cause their economy to collapse</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got the World Economic Forum promoting ideas like you&rsquo;re gonna own nothing in the year</p>
<p>2030 and you&rsquo;re gonna be eating insects because no one should be eating meat. So you&rsquo;ve got these like wacky</p>
<p>extreme, you know environmentalist ideas and anti</p>
<p>Capitalist anti-property ideas coming out of Davos</p>
<p>So I think the whole thing&rsquo;s been a bit of a disaster and for a brief moment. It looked like these people</p>
<p>Again, we&rsquo;re self-reflecting on their role in creating these disasters. But of course the tone quickly shifted to blaming</p>
<p>Disinformation on social media as the root cause of all these problems as opposed to their decades of decision-making</p>
<p>Running, you know</p>
<p>The leading nations of the world and the leading companies of the world and I think that the blame is properly put</p>
<p>Not on social media, but on</p>
<p>These leaders for making you know bad decisions</p>
<p>do you believe in the benefits of global trade where countries trade with one another and</p>
<p>shift the sourcing of supply and labor to the cheaper source so that the buyer can benefit from having things at a lower price and</p>
<p>ultimately the global economy grows as</p>
<p>Kind of being beneficial to the US over the last 30 years or net negative because we talked, you know about the the obvious</p>
<p>Consequences of global trade where we&rsquo;ve had industries gutted in the United States</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re trying to onshore them again and build redundancy and so on but that&rsquo;s becoming very expensive and ultimately leads to the inflation</p>
<p>of goods and services and</p>
<p>So as you look at kind of the yeah</p>
<p>The positive agenda of the World Economic Forum over the last 30 years being about</p>
<p>Improving global trade and global relations to enable global trade. Are you an anti globalist?</p>
<p>and you know, do you start to see yourself falling more in that camp as</p>
<p>You see and hear more of what comes out of Davos and from these organizations like them</p>
<p>Well, look all economic prosperity comes from trade</p>
<p>if we didn&rsquo;t have trade then we would all be subsistence farmers and hunters and gatherers, so we</p>
<p>Basically specialize in</p>
<p>Something and then create an overabundance of that and trade it for the rest of our necessities. The issue is that trade</p>
<p>Not only creates prosperity it creates dependencies because you&rsquo;re dependent on the people you&rsquo;re trading with and also it has</p>
<p>distributional effects in terms of geopolitical consequences, so</p>
<p>Trade with China has created some prosperity, but it&rsquo;s also hollowed out</p>
<p>the American manufacturing</p>
<p>Sector while also making China very rich, which has basically turned China into a major geopolitical competitor for the United States</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not like a free trade fanatic</p>
<p>I mean, I understand the ways that trade creates wealth</p>
<p>But I think it can also create these downsides that have to be managed and the fact of the matter is that this unfettered free trade</p>
<p>ideology contained the seeds of its own destruction because all the revisionist powers who are seeking to revise the US</p>
<p>Led global order they were basically enriched and</p>
<p>built up by the very free trade ideology that</p>
<p>neoliberals were promoting</p>
<p>So this neoliberal world order has kind of created the seeds of its own destruction</p>
<p>I think that it would have been much smarter for us</p>
<p>Two decades ago to be much more restrained in the China trade and to not throw open our markets</p>
<p>To Chinese products we basically gave them MFN status. This is back in the early</p>
<p>2000s and it was a bipartisan</p>
<p>project and a bipartisan decision</p>
<p>But the result of that has been the rapid rise of China at the expense of our manufacturing</p>
<p>Sectors and to the benefit of our consumer class, right?</p>
<p>I mean we do have $600 iPhones because of it and we do have cheap TVs and there has been a consumer market</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s demanded these low-priced goods</p>
<p>To</p>
<p>Yeah, but so everyone gets cheap goods at Target but in exchange for that we now have a real peer competitor to the United States</p>
<p>Which is capable of disrupting?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say our primacy in East Asia and you know, it&rsquo;s creating a much more challenging world</p>
<p>So look I can understand the reasons why people bought into this two decades ago</p>
<p>But I think that if we had it to do all over again</p>
<p>I think most people would recognize that we should not have given China permanent MFN status and we should have been more</p>
<p>Temperate in our willingness to throw open our markets to these countries. Come on. Do you think that the World Economic Forum has kind of?</p>
<p>Transitioned into this kind of neoliberal</p>
<p>organization now that&rsquo;s promoting these neoliberal beliefs that aren&rsquo;t really tied to the original construct of</p>
<p>Global enabling and supporting global trade and</p>
<p>Supporting the global economy and creating more prosperity and security around the world. I think it appeals to the insecure overachiever elite</p>
<p>Yeah, you know nobody building anything really gives a shit about Davos. Nobody is thinking what&rsquo;s going on. Nobody even knows when it happens, right?</p>
<p>so who cares about it people who like status and went to fancy schools and</p>
<p>Wants to feel like they&rsquo;re in the club and that&rsquo;s how they&rsquo;ve made it is going to this place which underneath is</p>
<p>A membership organization where people pay based on the number of people that get to go</p>
<p>So is it really that important?</p>
<p>substantively, no, but</p>
<p>Overachieving surplus elites in the West really valued the signal that it represents to other overachieving surplus elites in the West</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what Davos is that&rsquo;s what the Allen and company conference has become a lot of these things started off</p>
<p>Much purer than what they are today, but these are all membership driven</p>
<p>Revenue generating efforts in 30 or 40 years the all in summit will probably become that too</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the nature of things so I wouldn&rsquo;t spend so much time focused on a</p>
<p>Group of people getting together the funniest thing about Davos that I saw was zero hedge</p>
<p>Which said that the amount of prostitution is at record levels in Davos</p>
<p>And so it just kind of boils down to what it is, which is like any other conference</p>
<p>It just happens to be with more security guards and less security guards and the same stupid stuff happens that Davos that happens in</p>
<p>Vegas at name your conference CES. It&rsquo;s just a different kind of attendee</p>
<p>so I think the bigger thing is that</p>
<p>We are learning that the world tends to have these policy perspectives that swing in a pendulum and</p>
<p>the problem with the pendulum is that it is at extremes and</p>
<p>Saks is right. We went from an extreme where we were very closed off and</p>
<p>We were essentially subsistence farmers all of us were and then the pendulum has essentially peaked probably in the mid-teens of this decade</p>
<p>Or the century where we realized too much globalization actually hollows out local economies</p>
<p>So we need to find the equilibrium point and that inherently has more inflation</p>
<p>that inherently has higher prices and that inherently has</p>
<p>slower progress</p>
<p>but more consistent progress that benefits more people and this is what is so</p>
<p>Ideologically</p>
<p>disruptive to again</p>
<p>Surplus elites because they need the $600 iPhone the idea that they can&rsquo;t upgrade every year</p>
<p>Drives them into such a tizzy that they need to export all the jobs</p>
<p>Whereas a thousand dollar iPhone or a $1,500 iPhone may just mean that your upgrade cycle is two years</p>
<p>And just ask yourself</p>
<p>How many times have you upgraded as soon as the phone came out to realize man?</p>
<p>this phone is actually worse than the previous version and I probably could have just waited and</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of work that actually goes into building these things to actually make them better</p>
<p>So all you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re giving up optionality</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re allowing your brothers and sisters to struggle to basically feed the profit motives of one company</p>
<p>That in hindsight doesn&rsquo;t need to happen. So there&rsquo;s an equilibrium and I think that these next few decades</p>
<p>Will be about finding it. We have decided it&rsquo;s categorical that that level of globalization that we have had this unitary</p>
<p>singular monocultural way of thinking about things is</p>
<p>over and</p>
<p>David&rsquo;s right. It&rsquo;s because that system has created too many threats to the hegemony that brought us there</p>
<p>Jake and you that&rsquo;s a good thing. I think in general it&rsquo;ll be it&rsquo;ll be more prosperity for more people, but it&rsquo;ll be slower and</p>
<p>It will create points of friction that are represented in inflation and higher prices, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>So as J Cal as you know</p>
<p>Chamath points out like if you&rsquo;re upgrading every two years instead of one year your economy doesn&rsquo;t grow as fast</p>
<p>You have less spending. Yeah, if the price of things go up you have inflation the net cost of</p>
<p>De-globalization is higher prices and lower economic growth. That&rsquo;s just fundamental kind of macroeconomics. No, that&rsquo;s not true</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not true</p>
<p>Because the de-globalization in an individual economy will actually create GDP because you&rsquo;ll have to rebuild the things that I used to import</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. Yeah and over a period of time theoretically you could catch up and accelerate but</p>
<p>Jekyll like when you weigh this conversation about</p>
<p>Davos and globalization and US security against the one we just had which is why I wanted to talk about this</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re running into a debt crisis</p>
<p>We have limited spending capacity</p>
<p>We have a significant amount of investment needed if we are going to</p>
<p>Cut global trade ties that we&rsquo;ve depended on historically and start to build redundancy</p>
<p>can we afford this as a country can the West afford this given the economic slowdowns and inflation right now and</p>
<p>You know, how do we balance kind of these conversations against our domestic challenges economically Davos has a pretty serious PR problem they</p>
<p>have</p>
<p>Dubbed themselves like essentially a self-appointed Illuminati for the rest of us and that they&rsquo;re gonna set some global agenda</p>
<p>I think this year&rsquo;s agenda was like</p>
<p>Finding the future or defining the future</p>
<p>nobody asked these people to be in charge and</p>
<p>If you look at what&rsquo;s happened in the world the chaos of kovat and</p>
<p>you look at what&rsquo;s happened in terms of energy policy in Europe and</p>
<p>Then this obsession with social issues and being told you know, these farmers these truckers you&rsquo;re bad people</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not woke whatever it is</p>
<p>I think the public looks at Davos as the manifestation of these global elites</p>
<p>Who are lording over them some master plan whether it&rsquo;s real or not</p>
<p>That they&rsquo;re not part of and that doesn&rsquo;t take them into consideration and that takes into consideration only their profits and</p>
<p>When you actually peel it back as Chamath correctly pointed out</p>
<p>Davos is a huge grift. They they recruited me to be part of their world leaders</p>
<p>15 years ago after I&rsquo;d sold did you go second company and I met Claus the guy who runs it at some New York Four</p>
<p>Seasons event and</p>
<p>Then I got the bill and to be a world</p>
<p>leader</p>
<p>Was forty fucking thousand dollars and I was like what a global future leader. I don&rsquo;t know what that means</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not giving you forty thousand dollars. Are you and you had to pay?</p>
<p>You had to pay to be a global what future leader and you didn&rsquo;t have to pay</p>
<p>For a six thousand dollar TED ticket at the time. This was 40 large and</p>
<p>I just thought you know, this is not for me</p>
<p>And what a joke I think people would much rather see</p>
<p>some resiliency in the supply chain and they would rather see</p>
<p>the origins of kovat and why we spent two years in a lockdown and</p>
<p>Was that a cover-up of the United States funding?</p>
<p>gain of research</p>
<p>You know being done in Wuhan like and and why are we shutting down</p>
<p>Nuclear power plants and what exactly is the energy policy in Germany people are looking at</p>
<p>incompetent elites</p>
<p>Going to Davos having a big party and then setting an agenda for them that they don&rsquo;t understand or want</p>
<p>and I think this is where you know, the the the contempt for Davos is peaking this year and it should if you&rsquo;re being</p>
<p>invited to Davos and</p>
<p>Other people are not being invited and they don&rsquo;t have a seat at the table in a voice at the table</p>
<p>You can tell that all the journalists there are on an access journalism pass</p>
<p>What does that mean access journalism?</p>
<p>They get to come there and they get to hang out with elites if and only if their coverage fits a certain</p>
<p>Profile and if you find me the top 10 most critical</p>
<p>Anti-globalization journalists in the world. I can guarantee you that they don&rsquo;t have credentials. I think it&rsquo;s like a bankrupt organization</p>
<p>They should just be shut down and the people who are going there are involved. No, I think it&rsquo;s culturally bankrupt</p>
<p>You guys have so much disdain. It&rsquo;s interesting. No, I do</p>
<p>Not what the world wants right now the world wants transparency and the world wants ownership of</p>
<p>all the screw-ups</p>
<p>You know from kovat. Yeah to energy policy</p>
<p>We want ownership of those issues not a bunch of elites drinking champagne</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather spend a week with entrepreneurs or frankly spend a week with my kids or Frank</p>
<p>Yes, and a week playing poker with my friend. Of course, let&rsquo;s do it</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re like umpteen things that are above the list. So it&rsquo;s kind of like let them get together</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fine for them to get together. They should do it</p>
<p>I just think that if you&rsquo;re not there</p>
<p>I would not weigh these things so heavily because it speaks more to your own insecurity</p>
<p>Than it does to their actual influence on things. Yeah, the term elite is an interesting one</p>
<p>You you companies need a CEO to run the company. It&rsquo;s not run by 10,000 employees and</p>
<p>Governments need a president to oversee the government</p>
<p>And I think the idea that some small number of people that are in charge getting together is now being cast as</p>
<p>An elite gathering and elitism in itself is the failure</p>
<p>Is I think I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s an elite gathering. I think it&rsquo;s very important to get this nuance, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a gathering of elites</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s very different than an elite gathering an elite gathering is when like</p>
<p>Michael jordan and lebron james and steph curry get together and work on their basketball game. That&rsquo;s an elite gathering a gathering of elites</p>
<p>Is what&rsquo;s happening in devils?</p>
<p>But they are the presidents of their companies and the presidents of their countries</p>
<p>So I would differentiate between the people who are merely attending who are paying the forty thousand dollars</p>
<p>Probably a bunch of hangers on it&rsquo;s now 250 by the way</p>
<p>$250,000. Yeah, anyone willing to pay that is like, you know, totally an insecure, you know, surplus elite</p>
<p>By the way, I just got back from davos. Oh, you did. Okay. Well, congratulations</p>
<p>Looks good on you though</p>
<p>Did you spend your own money or your lp&rsquo;s money? No, I didn&rsquo;t go to davos</p>
<p>I mean one person that went to davos that spent their own money. It&rsquo;s like probably not right exactly</p>
<p>So then there&rsquo;s the hangers on you&rsquo;re spending 250 000 to feel important</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s the people who are invited who probably don&rsquo;t spend any money who are basically speaking, right?</p>
<p>and you got to say that the the group of people who are speaking at davos individually and collectively are</p>
<p>quite influential they are the leaders of</p>
<p>Countries and and fortune 500 companies sure, but you can agree that they literally don&rsquo;t say anything</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s noteworthy because they&rsquo;re not allowed to they&rsquo;re not saying anything</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that different of what they would say the previous week or the following week. So but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a forum</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a platform for it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a yeah, it&rsquo;s a forum</p>
<p>Yeah to get together</p>
<p>Look in terms of the critique of it</p>
<p>Freeberg you asked how far back does this go? It&rsquo;s this is not like a new thing</p>
<p>The the term davos man was coined back in 2004 by a harvard professor named sam huntington</p>
<p>who wrote a book called clash civilizations, he&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>Professor of international relations at harvard and he coined the term davos man to refer to a globalist</p>
<p>Who quote had little need for national loyalty who viewed national boundaries as obstacles that are thankfully, uh vanishing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how huntington defined davos man and</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a reaction to</p>
<p>these</p>
<p>Davos men that&rsquo;s been growing for a couple of decades. I mean obviously the election of trump was a reaction to that</p>
<p>Brexit was a huge reaction to that</p>
<p>and I think that the</p>
<p>Resistance to the imposition of their again their globalist policies, which I guess you could define as believing in this like borderless world</p>
<p>You know economically and politically. I think that&rsquo;s been receding in favor of more nationalist leaders</p>
<p>Who want to promote their own country&rsquo;s interests?</p>
<p>And I think that that trend is going to continue</p>
<p>Well chamath, let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s transition this to the the broader question that I think</p>
<p>We got into it a couple episodes ago</p>
<p>on how can we</p>
<p>afford this transition</p>
<p>If there is this mounting</p>
<p>Kind of trend against globalization this mounting</p>
<p>De-globalization movement and effort particularly in the us and again as sax pointed out global debt to gdp is something like</p>
<p>300 to 350 depending on how you count</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re running into a debt ceiling here in the us</p>
<p>I guess the question is how do we afford to build the infrastructure redundancy?</p>
<p>And make the investments at home</p>
<p>To replace global trade</p>
<p>Can we afford to do it and how&rsquo;s this going to play out as we run into this?</p>
<p>You know debt ceiling vote. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the right question. I think it&rsquo;s the inverse of that question</p>
<p>How can we afford not to?</p>
<p>with the amount of discontent and the amount of economic strain that people feel</p>
<p>If you want to really quell populism, you&rsquo;re going to have to create economic vibrancy at home when people are making money and they find</p>
<p>purpose</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re less agitated. They&rsquo;re not storming the capital. They&rsquo;re not electing</p>
<p>fringe candidates</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>Doing domestic terrorism. They&rsquo;re just going to work and building a life</p>
<p>Right. We know that so how can we afford not to how can we afford not to like bring back jobs to the heartland of america?</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>the reality that I have and I think a lot of people have is that</p>
<p>This debt to gdp thing is a bit of an intellectual red herring</p>
<p>And the reason is people talk about this thing constantly in these absolute terms</p>
<p>With no historical precedent that relates well to our current moment</p>
<p>There is no magic number at which thing this experiment that&rsquo;s called america fails</p>
<p>So I think that you have to be a little bit more intellectually honest and say that at best it&rsquo;s a relative problem</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s relative to</p>
<p>The countries that have already established dominance of which there are eight or nine</p>
<p>And then the emerging economies and then thinking about what critical things will they bring to the table in 15 or 20 years from now</p>
<p>And in that context</p>
<p>I think that people will him and haw</p>
<p>But ultimately they&rsquo;ll capitulate they will raise the debt ceiling and they&rsquo;ll continue to fund</p>
<p>This transition away from globalism and I think that&rsquo;s the argument that will get the republicans over the line</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s going to bring a lot of spending and stimulus and jobs</p>
<p>To frankly a lot of red states that would otherwise kind of continue to wither and die on the vine</p>
<p>I think here&rsquo;s my biggest concern</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re either trying to walk a tightrope or there&rsquo;s no tightrope to walk</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>If we make these investments and they&rsquo;re not economically viable investments</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a path to ruin</p>
<p>And what I mean by that is if we&rsquo;re building</p>
<p>factories manufacturing facilities</p>
<p>Infrastructure that relies on yesteryear&rsquo;s technology and systems of</p>
<p>production and</p>
<p>kind of economic systems</p>
<p>And there are alternatives that are competing on a global stage that are better more productive more advanced</p>
<p>Then we lose and we&rsquo;ve made an investment in a negative roi way, but hold on a second</p>
<p>Can I ask you a question?</p>
<p>Yeah, see when you say that though, you&rsquo;re making a very basic assumption, which I think you can question which is you are underpinning that</p>
<p>On fundamental economics that can change if we choose to for example, let&rsquo;s take like natural resources</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>Every time you do a plan the industry and I define the industry as every for-profit company and wall street and the debt markets</p>
<p>They refuse to underwrite this thing at a higher cost of capital. They use a whack</p>
<p>Of six or seven or eight and they will fight tooth and nail</p>
<p>To use the smallest discount rate possible because it allows them to capture more of the profit dollars</p>
<p>But if you actually had a realistic whack of like 10 on an on a massive infrastructure project</p>
<p>Guess what?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re actually pretty equivalent to a government and in fact in many cases the government becomes cheaper</p>
<p>So I think the thing that is worth debating and i&rsquo;d like your reaction to this. It&rsquo;s not that what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s we refuse to change the guardrails on our profit making ability</p>
<p>And if you extended the window if you change the discount rate if you said pes can be different</p>
<p>You would have a very different economic justification for what you just said</p>
<p>It completely changes a hundred basis points changes everything you&rsquo;re saying by tens of years one way to describe that. Yeah is</p>
<p>Another way to reframe what you just said</p>
<p>Is that the useful lifespan of an investment isn&rsquo;t 40 years or 50 years, but it may be 12 years</p>
<p>And if you if you recast the investment decision as this has to be a 12-year return</p>
<p>Instead of allowing it to be modeled as a 40-year return</p>
<p>Then you start to really filter out a lot of the nonsense and you can actually see real payback</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to spend a hundred billion dollars</p>
<p>On a train to take people from la to fresno or whatever craziness the the california</p>
<p>High-speed rail program has turned into it was originally like a billion dollars to go from la to san francisco</p>
<p>There was economic justification to get payback on 100 billion dollars or whatever. It&rsquo;s ballooned into</p>
<p>The whole system should be shut down</p>
<p>So I guess there&rsquo;s a from a policy perspective and accountability framing that&rsquo;s missing but also bringing in</p>
<p>The time horizon on which we need to get paid back for these things</p>
<p>My point was that in china and i&rsquo;ve made this point many times</p>
<p>But I just think it&rsquo;s a really important one that&rsquo;ll play out over the next couple of years</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re building 450 nuclear power plants</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to get the cost of industrial power below five cents or four cents a kilowatt hour</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re electrifying all their factories as they do that. It&rsquo;s no longer a unit of human labor</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s needed to produce goods</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a unit of electricity and if they&rsquo;re driving down the cost of electricity and all products can be made using electricity</p>
<p>You have a huge economic advantage. It&rsquo;s not the cure-all that you think that is even if you have free energy</p>
<p>You have to think about the inputs and the thing that china, but no, sorry. I&rsquo;m not talking about energy</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, just saying a general framing like no, I understand my point being like the investments</p>
<p>We should be making or where is the puck headed not where has the puck been?</p>
<p>No, no</p>
<p>So I just I just wanted to comment on where the puck is heading</p>
<p>Even if energy is zero in china, you have to think about inputs meaning factories make things with inputs</p>
<p>And if you look for example in natural resources the inputs by and large don&rsquo;t exist in china</p>
<p>and so all i&rsquo;m saying is that all of these inputs whether</p>
<p>Again, you can take natural resources that proliferate massively in the united states. It turns out that india is</p>
<p>Utterly utterly utterly poorly addressed in a geographical survey perspective and we&rsquo;re finding that india&rsquo;s raw resources</p>
<p>Are off the charts. Okay, there&rsquo;s certain places in africa tons of stuff in indonesia and australia</p>
<p>all of those things</p>
<p>May not have to go to china because there are subsidies or there are equivalently cheaper</p>
<p>Decisions that governments can make so that they choose not to send it and all of a sudden</p>
<p>All of that spending doesn&rsquo;t matter as much because the australian government makes a trade-off that says, you know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather have these jobs here and i&rsquo;m willing to have a longer payback cycle for these jobs to be here</p>
<p>Then instead of ship it to china</p>
<p>And he they tell that they tell the australian citizens</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, sorry guys, but you&rsquo;re gonna have to replace your car every seven years as opposed to every five</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;re okay with that</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;ll mean full employment and it&rsquo;ll prevent fringe candidates and populism</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s go forward. Where do you invest?</p>
<p>I am investing I am investing a lot of money</p>
<p>In those places that control the natural resources that are poorly understood meaning</p>
<p>there are places like india where</p>
<p>Our geological survey capacity is relatively naive and it turns out that</p>
<p>in critical parts of the energy supply chain or other places</p>
<p>They can play a huge role and the indian government&rsquo;s cost of capital</p>
<p>Has an element they&rsquo;re sophisticated enough</p>
<p>to add</p>
<p>An element to the formula that accounts for full employment</p>
<p>If I build it in this state and if I try to get this many jobs created</p>
<p>The full circle feedback of that allows me to actually transfer price it into the indian market at this price</p>
<p>Which is cheaper than anything that china can do even at zero energy</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of sophisticated decision making that is emerging because of this deglobalization trend and it&rsquo;s happening everywhere</p>
<p>So the indians are doing it the germans are doing it</p>
<p>And then the us is doing it and then on top of that what they&rsquo;re what they&rsquo;re doing in terms of game theory</p>
<p>Which I think is even more sophisticated is</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not letting china be alone. They&rsquo;re actually now slowing china down</p>
<p>Because china turns out actually needs inputs from these western economies and they&rsquo;re like we&rsquo;re just not going to give them to you anymore</p>
<p>So do the best you can for example in semiconductors the dutch the germans the americans</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve now essentially embargoed all of our most sophisticated equipment from ever getting in there</p>
<p>That will increase even with zero energy</p>
<p>the cost of what comes out of there and that will</p>
<p>Balance the playing field so that the germans the dutch the americans can bring other partners in</p>
<p>at a different cost of capital</p>
<p>To make it economically neutral and at parity and the reason they&rsquo;ll do it is to create jobs for americans</p>
<p>Or the dutch or for the germans, okay, I think the most yeah, go ahead. Freeberg</p>
<p>I I just I I think the most important thing here isn&rsquo;t like energy</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s infrastructure</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s natural resources at least for america. It&rsquo;s entrepreneurs</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s always been for this country</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s immigration</p>
<p>Is the silver bullet here?</p>
<p>And inspiration and the freedom that this country has</p>
<p>For entrepreneurs and founders to pursue a vision to start a company</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve won so big historically is the the combination of immigration</p>
<p>and the inspiration that these entrepreneurs</p>
<p>Do on a global basis to get more entrepreneurs to come to this country to go to stanford to start companies</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why china is now losing</p>
<p>they</p>
<p>cribbed this incredible formula we had of letting</p>
<p>Jack ma do alibaba and then they decided to for whatever, you know</p>
<p>Insecure or stupid reason or pragmatic reason to consolidate power</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what will push the world forward and and make our country thrive</p>
<p>We have to fix immigration we have to keep letting entrepreneurs</p>
<p>Define the future because the government can do so much they can underwrite a couple of chip factories here or there</p>
<p>Sure, we could put money into nuclear or fission or fusion and whatever the next technology is</p>
<p>but you need a singular person who wants to make it their life&rsquo;s mission who wants to have</p>
<p>their</p>
<p>Sense of pride and innovation push the world forward and those people are rare and we are in a competition globally</p>
<p>That we are not focused on</p>
<p>The that we need to get refocused on to recruit the greatest minds in the world who want to change the world to do it</p>
<p>on</p>
<p>American soil. I do not disagree with you. J cal I think</p>
<p>You know to my earlier comment about how do we walk the tightrope of the debt burden the deglobalization and populism movements?</p>
<p>And the and the challenges and opportunities ahead it has to come through innovation. I think that&rsquo;s how you</p>
<p>You have to invent a new tightrope. Basically. I think the challenge though is freeberg that</p>
<p>It takes a recognition that there are singular individuals in the world</p>
<p>One in a million one in 10 million one in 100 000, whatever it is</p>
<p>Who can just drive an entire economy forward whether it&rsquo;s gates with microsoft or steve jobs with apple</p>
<p>There are singular individuals who come to this country bam bam brogan with uh, the tunneling company</p>
<p>Nice Paul, nobody knows what you&rsquo;re talking about except for me</p>
<p>There are people who will push these things forward and and take risk and we have to yeah</p>
<p>Recognize that it&rsquo;s a small number of individuals</p>
<p>Backed by a large amount of capital</p>
<p>That create massive jobs and great prosperity</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an uncomfortable conversation for people to realize that it might just be a couple of dozen people a year</p>
<p>Immigrating to this country that change the fate of this country</p>
<p>Yeah, why do you need to allow three million migrants to stream across the southern border every year because you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>Which one it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why really</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s your immigration policy is open border. So that one is a million. I said recruitment</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the opposite of it</p>
<p>Explain that it&rsquo;s a great question sax. There are there are two things to look at here. There is a pragmatic</p>
<p>Hold on. Let me finish my sentence. No, I&rsquo;m just going to ask you to just clarify as you say</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your are you saying that the phd student that starts google is streaming across the border or actually applying for</p>
<p>No, absolutely not</p>
<p>Let me parse it for you</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s immigration and then there&rsquo;s recruitment and if we frame this process with those two different words</p>
<p>There are people who are yes immigrating streaming across the border. However, you want to frame it sax</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t look at it</p>
<p>In a political way and then there&rsquo;s recruiting the most elite talent in the world</p>
<p>We can do both of these things</p>
<p>one of them, you know, uh helps</p>
<p>Farmers have people to work the fields to have people take entry-level jobs to work in the service industry</p>
<p>We should bring in two or three million of those people per year. We should make it legal</p>
<p>And we should celebrate it because we have so many of those positions open that americans don&rsquo;t want to take we should then also</p>
<p>in parallel</p>
<p>And without confusing the issue for political reasons recruit people to come to our universities and when they graduate</p>
<p>Have their citizenship staple to that diploma and not let them leave the company country and let them start companies here</p>
<p>Instead what we do is we make them fight to stay here</p>
<p>We should be recruiting the smartest most talented people. That will be hundreds of thousands of people per year</p>
<p>Well hundreds of thousands. Okay, and then we should have millions coming across the border sick. J cal is very reasonable</p>
<p>No, shit. J cal is great. Yeah, I I think he&rsquo;s so much better when he doesn&rsquo;t moderate. Yeah</p>
<p>Yeah, go ahead sex</p>
<p>You know, i&rsquo;m an immigrant</p>
<p>You know, my dad came over. Yeah, my dad came over in</p>
<p>1977 when I was five years old, of course, he had an md. He was a doctor</p>
<p>He actually had like skills and wasn&rsquo;t immediately can become a net government dependent. So</p>
<p>I think that it makes sense to allow immigrants who can actually add something into our economy and bring skills and all the rest</p>
<p>Of it, but the problem we have is that if you want to take that reasonable position</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re told that you basically have to accept</p>
<p>A situation of de facto open borders, which is ridiculous. No, you don&rsquo;t these are two separate things and</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve become conflated</p>
<p>Is the number one</p>
<p>Party that conflates these two issues, you know, they&rsquo;re two separate issues. The democratic party has conflated these issues</p>
<p>Okay, both parties are conflating them here at the all-in podcast. Can we agree that? Yeah, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>People could recruit people for phd programs one group of people allows people across the border service jobs</p>
<p>Yes, obviously the more nuanced policy is the way to go. But but look let me tie this back to davos man</p>
<p>What was the definition of davos man? It was somebody who was pushing</p>
<p>This ideology of free trade and open borders to such an extent that it creates a nationalist</p>
<p>Backlash or populist backlash enough. Yeah, that&rsquo;s exactly what&rsquo;s happened at our southern border is</p>
<p>You have the people who believe in immigration push that ideology to such an extent that they won&rsquo;t create a rational sensible</p>
<p>Southern border and process at our southern border. It&rsquo;s chaos down there</p>
<p>Yeah, i&rsquo;m in favor of bringing in the dream team</p>
<p>But the response of open borders is the creation of this nationalist movement, right?</p>
<p>The nationalist movement only exists in the face of open borders. I think that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the point right like the extreme</p>
<p>Bears the extreme I think the immigration system should be based on points</p>
<p>Just like canada those men don&rsquo;t if the davos men don&rsquo;t start taking start taking into account these national considerations</p>
<p>around the defense of their borders and</p>
<p>These issues around trade hollowing out the middle class</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s going to be an intense backlash and I don&rsquo;t think those elites have been managing the situation very well</p>
<p>It would it would have been better for them to pursue the more nuanced policy you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>Why are we conflating the issue then?</p>
<p>Why do the democrats and the republicans sacks make this such a polarizing issue instead of stating it the way I did</p>
<p>Recruitment, it&rsquo;s so easy. It&rsquo;s so easy</p>
<p>You know when you when you conflate them you can incite an emotional response from your voting base</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s why all of these issues. That&rsquo;s why all of these issues get based out</p>
<p>They get based out to the point that then you can drive someone to vote for you</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ve now framed the other side as this extreme side</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how you earlier said hold on before you got suddenly very reasonable</p>
<p>You said that we have always been this reason why you haven&rsquo;t listened</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to quote something you just said a minute ago. You said that we had to allow two to three million</p>
<p>Two to three million completely destitute</p>
<p>Practically illiterate migrants to stream across our border because one in a million of them might be an elon musk</p>
<p>No, no, there could be no. No, hold on. I was talking about you can take it back</p>
<p>No, no, i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>Immigration typically includes when you say that word</p>
<p>The corpus of people coming in for education and the people coming across the southern border</p>
<p>So if you were to say immigration, most people would reasonably say that&rsquo;s both of those buckets</p>
<p>I separated them out here so we could have a reasonable discussion recruitment of higher education talented people with low</p>
<p>education</p>
<p>Migrant workers they are two different buckets and you have to be able to say</p>
<p>These are two different buckets and that we should have a point-based system</p>
<p>If and this is the conversation that doesn&rsquo;t happen amongst politicians, but can happen here. Look at canada</p>
<p>Look at australia. They have what&rsquo;s called a point-based immigration system</p>
<p>They give you points for everything</p>
<p>That you bring to the country if you bring money</p>
<p>If you speak the native language if you have a degree if you have a higher education degree</p>
<p>Or you have skills that that country needs</p>
<p>Our country needs to move to a point-based system</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re coming across the board and you don&rsquo;t speak the language and you don&rsquo;t have an education</p>
<p>You have zero points if you have a master&rsquo;s degree, how about we just speak two or three points and you can let in buckets</p>
<p>of people based on compassion</p>
<p>Based on needing service workers and based on needing</p>
<p>The next elon musk or the next david sachs or trim off poly hoppity</p>
<p>I think the the argument jcal is that the compassion argument falls on deaf ears</p>
<p>In a time where people feel we cannot afford it and it&rsquo;s a luxury to embrace that model of immigration right now</p>
<p>Just pick a number we can reasonably absorb. This is what finland did the southern border and see chaos</p>
<p>Obviously, they want to get that under control before they&rsquo;re going to adopt your you know point-based system</p>
<p>We can do two things at once we could do no the point-based system</p>
<p>Point-based system. I like the idea of I don&rsquo;t know if my points are the same as your points, but in concept I like</p>
<p>No, no, we don&rsquo;t need to I like the idea of admitting</p>
<p>immigrants based on skills the country actually needs</p>
<p>Great and a simple recognition that is better to bring in people who are immediately productive</p>
<p>Hold on and can add to our economy as opposed to being net government recipients dependence. We&rsquo;re done. We&rsquo;re done</p>
<p>There are countries. I just want to make a point. There are countries</p>
<p>the scandinavian country specifically</p>
<p>That have said we can accept up to this many</p>
<p>folks</p>
<p>Who are uneducated who don&rsquo;t speak the language because we have this many teachers and this many slots in school</p>
<p>And so I think it was finland and sweden</p>
<p>They said we can accept 50 000 per year of this type of immigration based on compassion</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reasonable discussion that has to happen here</p>
<p>Did you just say that we have to do these two things at the same time meaning that until we impose a</p>
<p>An overhaul of our entire immigration system to be based on skills and points</p>
<p>That we can&rsquo;t enforce the southern border</p>
<p>No, I think you can&rsquo;t enforce the southern border and do it. I think you can do these things at the same time</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>Let me just tell you there&rsquo;s gonna be no</p>
<p>Canada and australia are already doing it</p>
<p>Let me just tell you there&rsquo;s not going to be a broad-based constituency in this country for the type of immigration reform</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about until you get the southern border under control because people look at that on the news and see chaos</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no excuse for that. They should be thoughtful</p>
<p>They should be thoughtful and they should just look at what canada and australia have done</p>
<p>Those countries have actually controlled this and it&rsquo;s not a polarizing issue there. It&rsquo;s a pragmatic issue. Okay guys, i&rsquo;m going to move us forward</p>
<p>to the uh</p>
<p>The banning of tiktok. So I want to kind of change the the tone a little bit</p>
<p>this uh</p>
<p>story recently</p>
<p>Is that tiktok has been banned for use on the campus wi-fi network?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go at a number of universities including ut austin auburn boise state the university of oklahoma</p>
<p>So college students can&rsquo;t access the app when they&rsquo;re on the campus network</p>
<p>This is following 19 states that recently banned tiktok and government devices as everyone knows tiktok is a product</p>
<p>from bytedance, which is a chinese-based company and there&rsquo;s been quite a lot of</p>
<p>Political and regulatory huffs and gruffs about bytedance having this level of insight and access</p>
<p>To users in the united states with the assumption being that much of the data that they&rsquo;re pulling out of the app</p>
<p>is available to the chinese communist party, which</p>
<p>creates a security</p>
<p>threat to the united states</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one argument</p>
<p>I think there is also a significant tie-in to bytedance</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s over eight billion dollars of capital invested in bytedance by firms that we know</p>
<p>Well, like sequoia capital tiger global co2 susquehanna</p>
<p>And others they&rsquo;re trying to find a way to monetize their investment in what is truly</p>
<p>The most viral fastest growing highest revenue growing biggest startup in the world right now in bytedance</p>
<p>So there is a restructuring proposal apparently underway that&rsquo;s being discussed in washington dc right now</p>
<p>to try and restructure the organization and the ownership structure and the oversight of</p>
<p>Tiktok and bytedance such that us regulators and us companies can oversee the data the use of the data the algorithms</p>
<p>Underlying tiktok and monitor them from within the united states question for this group here on the mclaughlin group</p>
<p>of 2023 is</p>
<p>Does that do enough for you mclaughlin?</p>
<p>Do you guys think that that&rsquo;s enough?</p>
<p>first up is uh</p>
<p>Chamath who&rsquo;s been silenced for a bit. I think this is really bad news for bytedance. Basically what&rsquo;s happening is that and tiktok</p>
<p>All the frustration that all these legislature legislators and politicians have had over</p>
<p>Facebook and google</p>
<p>and other sort of big tech companies</p>
<p>Is going to get focused on bytedance because you have this common enemy that you can point to as a boogeyman of sorts</p>
<p>And i&rsquo;m not saying that it&rsquo;s right, but I think that what you&rsquo;re starting to see is it&rsquo;s much easier</p>
<p>To pick a fight with a chinese company and win</p>
<p>And get broad-based support than it is to pick a fight against an american company with a bunch of</p>
<p>American employees an american market cap and american know-how and american ip that gets impacted</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is going to end well for tiktok and</p>
<p>I think the goal if I were any of these people on the cap table</p>
<p>Would be to sell it</p>
<p>In secondary to somebody else and get out. I think the next big shoe to drop</p>
<p>Is going to be advertisers who come under a lot of pressure</p>
<p>So for example, think of all the advertisers that have left twitter</p>
<p>There is a point of efficiency where you can live with all of the mess that twitter has</p>
<p>Because it comes with a lot less scrutiny and oversight and political pressure than advertising on tiktok</p>
<p>And that</p>
<p>I think is the next kind of like big wave here. So I think it&rsquo;s very very bad</p>
<p>I think the enterprise value of this company is</p>
<p>quite challenged</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>These guys should try to sell and get up who are the buyers in that secondary market though</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a lot of capital. The thing is the cap tables haven&rsquo;t been segregated</p>
<p>So what you own is equity and bite dance, right?</p>
<p>But the problem is the look-through ownership would will discount</p>
<p>A lot of tiktok if they see a lot more of this stuff happening</p>
<p>You guys have to remember this is the first three or four weeks of 2023</p>
<p>Wait till we&rsquo;re here in september and october and november wait till the election year starts</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not good. So</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a discount on bite dance that probably</p>
<p>Takes bike dance down by 70 or 80 billion. So that&rsquo;s a 35 40 discount to their last mark</p>
<p>So, you know if somebody can sell in the high 100 billions of dollars</p>
<p>I think you should I think they should probably they should consider it. There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth it. I think jk. I know you got strong opinions. Well, no, I think you have to be incredibly pragmatic here</p>
<p>This is the same as the 5g issue. You cannot trust the chinese government to not</p>
<p>Steal intellectual property or to put back doors into the software. It is common business practice there</p>
<p>Huawei was banned. They basically stole the source code from cisco that was proven</p>
<p>And it was proven that they were spying on people</p>
<p>Canada the uk the united states vietnam. Everybody has banned</p>
<p>using</p>
<p>5g technology from china for a reason because they will use it to spy on you. This is uh, the nature of</p>
<p>An authoritarian government. It is far too powerful to have a uh</p>
<p>Not only the surveillance capabilities that are built into owning tiktok in the hands of the chinese communist party</p>
<p>to have the ability to</p>
<p>Very in a very nuanced fashion</p>
<p>Trends certain videos that would steer the united states in a certain direction</p>
<p>Politically or yeah towards stupidity is one of course, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re letting their you need to look at 60 minutes. That 60 minutes clip is incredible, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like they show they&rsquo;re showing science videos to the kids in china exactly and they&rsquo;re showing stupid nonsense to the kids in america</p>
<p>What do you think over millions of videos?</p>
<p>Our children versus their children you can be a hundred percent certain they&rsquo;re doing psyops on our children as we speak</p>
<p>They are trying to make us dumb and distracted while they get smart and sharp, by the way</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very simple if you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re a sucker, you know, that&rsquo;s not the choices of our kids</p>
<p>The algorithm just gives you more what you want</p>
<p>Exactly, of course, but that&rsquo;s like saying if you gave kids a choice between broccoli and chocolate bars, of course</p>
<p>If you put the kids in the supermarket and say eat they&rsquo;re going to go right to the cereal</p>
<p>The job of the parent sacks is number one know their name and then number two differentiate</p>
<p>You need a pen and pad sacks good things and that&rsquo;s your question I agree with chamath that the future is not bright</p>
<p>For tiktok here because it&rsquo;s gotten caught up in the geopolitical rivalry between china and the united states</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s only going to keep getting more and more intense</p>
<p>The u.s and china are headed for a big security competition and by dance is caught in the middle</p>
<p>So I agree with chamath about the future. But you know, this claim is made that</p>
<p>Tick tock is spyware</p>
<p>And you know, it&rsquo;s listening to you it&rsquo;s surveilling you it&rsquo;s keeping track of you</p>
<p>Like what is the evidence for that claim?</p>
<p>I just want to understand that a little better like has anyone ever proven</p>
<p>That like tick tock is spyware and if it is why does an apple stop it?</p>
<p>Could you explain that to me? Yeah, I think apple has a complicated relationship with china. So the claim</p>
<p>That they&rsquo;re not going to do it</p>
<p>So jk your claim is let me I just want to pin jk down on this for a second your claim is that?</p>
<p>100</p>
<p>Tick tock is spyware and apple is letting it happen because their relationship with the ccp</p>
<p>I do not have the evidence of specific instances of them spying</p>
<p>But I do know that this is what the chinese government</p>
<p>Uh his aspiration is is to be able to have back doors to spy on all americans</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they you know are trying to get huawei</p>
<p>Well</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even need to know that because you can just open your eyes and look at and I mean that&rsquo;s an insult</p>
<p>But you can just look at what tick tock has the access to it has access to your location</p>
<p>Has access to your camera roll and it knows</p>
<p>You know, uh everybody in your social circle because it has your address book</p>
<p>So by having your address book having your location and having access to your photo roll</p>
<p>They have you compromised by default the default settings when you install tick tock it turns on local network turns on microphone turns on camera</p>
<p>Turns on background app refresh and turns on cell data. So</p>
<p>Tick knock is no worse than anybody else</p>
<p>In that because a lot of other apps are very aggressively trying to harvest all that data as well sax</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s like alexa is always listening to you, right?</p>
<p>but you feel but you feel safer with alexa because it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an american company or the perception of safety is there so I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a huge</p>
<p>Thing to prove other than yeah, there&rsquo;s a setting that allows you to turn on the microphone</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a default and they do it but they were caught</p>
<p>I just want to make sure you guys understand this according to the new york times by dance the chinese parent company of tick tock</p>
<p>Said on thursday that an internal investigation found that employees had inappropriately obtained the data of us tick tock users including</p>
<p>That of two reporters over the summer a few employees on a bite dance team responsible for monitoring employee conduct</p>
<p>Tried to find the source of suspected leaks of internal conversation and business documents to journalists in doing so</p>
<p>The employees gained access to the ip addresses and other data of two reporters and a small number of people connected with the reporters</p>
<p>By the tick tock accounts. They were trying to determine if those individuals were within the proximity of by dance employees according to the company</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an example of them using the technology to try to track down leaks. Hold on a second. That&rsquo;s exactly what any app</p>
<p>A company can do the photos the screenshots we got from twitter</p>
<p>Um that were shared and all those files or whatever that happened a few weeks ago</p>
<p>Showed that that many twitter employees were able to log in and just view</p>
<p>The direct messages between twitter users and that there&rsquo;s no necessary logging or um access privileges required to have access to that information</p>
<p>There are these holes in all of these social networking and consumer</p>
<p>Digital consumer product companies that allow individuals to go in and do things with consumer data. It&rsquo;s not a hole. It&rsquo;s a feature</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a feature sure, but it doesn&rsquo;t reference like some systematic</p>
<p>Um, yeah, but those aren&rsquo;t controlled by a government agency</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the key thing what jkal just said is a key thing</p>
<p>Everybody tries to get these things turned default on every app</p>
<p>Tries to get access to your camera roll to your contacts to turn on the microphone</p>
<p>The problem isn&rsquo;t that those settings exist because apple created them and apple created a privacy framework where you have to opt out of it</p>
<p>Okay, the issue is that that data instead of going to an american company with american</p>
<p>On with american data centers and american service it&rsquo;s going to somebody in china or it&rsquo;s the perception that that&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>that I think is a death now and</p>
<p>This is also excluding all of the work</p>
<p>That every single big tech company must be doing to point the finger away from them</p>
<p>And this is something they can all agree on if you got if you got andy jassy and zuck and sundar and satya nadella in a room</p>
<p>What do you think they could all agree on?</p>
<p>Hey guys, are we better off pointing the fingers at each other or should we just point it over there to a company based in china?</p>
<p>So do you think do you think that tick tock in a way is being scapegoated here?</p>
<p>Or do you think it&rsquo;s a real security threat both both?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s yes to both and you know what I think what we saw with the the twitter files for me personally</p>
<p>The one that uh was most concerning</p>
<p>Was the fact that the fbi?</p>
<p>Was being treated</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have control of it. Like the chinese government has control over by dance at a wholesale level</p>
<p>But they were being given</p>
<p>you know pretty um</p>
<p>Close to they weren&rsquo;t giving god privileges, but they had more influence than they should have and they should have gotten subpoenas</p>
<p>Right. So even in a democracy like the united states, you can see the fbi</p>
<p>Using techniques to get employees on their side</p>
<p>To get information on specific users. Imagine if the fbi just had god mode for twitter or facebook</p>
<p>Like what would happen even in a democracy? We see it happen. We see abuse</p>
<p>the chinese</p>
<p>Government is a communist party. They have no problem sucking the data down of every single person and using it. However, they want</p>
<p>I think the the problematic thing is that when you look at the capital structure of these chinese companies post now</p>
<p>g being ruler for life is</p>
<p>The chinese government has typically a seat on all of these boards</p>
<p>They also typically have a golden vote</p>
<p>And so when you think about the governance the governance of these companies has tilted</p>
<p>far away from</p>
<p>a normal cap table where it&rsquo;s one shareholder one vote to</p>
<p>You are allowed to exist on this cap table at the benevolence</p>
<p>Of the government and so I think that you have to factor that in as well sack. So, you know, is it amplified?</p>
<p>Probably but is there also non-trivial risk that we would never give to any other company?</p>
<p>Absolutely, like, you know take the opposite example</p>
<p>How would we react if the government had a golden vote and a board seat on meta?</p>
<p>Going into an election</p>
<p>I mean one party would be crazy and the other party would stay mum&rsquo;s the word</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I mean. Let&rsquo;s talk about but let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s be pragmatic the news reports that came out this week</p>
<p>Indicate that they&rsquo;re talking about restructuring by dance</p>
<p>So let me propose this to you guys if tiktok us were set up as tiktok us inc</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s its own c corp. It&rsquo;s based in the u.s. And by dance owns</p>
<p>passive non-voting shares</p>
<p>In tiktok us all the software all the services the algorithms are all run in the u.s</p>
<p>The data is only sitting on servers in the u.s</p>
<p>And the chinese have an economic interest ultimately and what happens with that asset, but that asset is entirely managed</p>
<p>Run, it&rsquo;s totally fine. That should be a goal in the u.s</p>
<p>And I think either shut it down or do that</p>
<p>And if that happens you trigger syphilis, so you&rsquo;d have to then make an exception</p>
<p>That sounds like it&rsquo;s part of the discussion that&rsquo;s underway right now is how do we get past this regulatory hurdle?</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t know guys i&rsquo;ve said this in the past</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how you turn off tiktok for 100 million people that are using it for two hours a day guys</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re making their background. We&rsquo;re instagram and youtube replicated it. We&rsquo;re rejecting deals</p>
<p>Left right and center at much much smaller thresholds because of syphilis because</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s we&rsquo;re not and we&rsquo;re not even dealing with china</p>
<p>I assume you get past syphilis chamath assume that there is no that they figure out a way</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bad assumption, right?</p>
<p>But like that&rsquo;s obviously there&rsquo;s eight billion dollars of capital because can I tell you what&rsquo;s in this right the minute that if you let?</p>
<p>the chinese government</p>
<p>Around and do an end around on syphilis to own 30</p>
<p>Passively then everybody who&rsquo;s had a deal rejected for a much smaller threshold for a much more benign</p>
<p>Issue will sue</p>
<p>Except that they started with this asset versus buying into it, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the difference and what they&rsquo;re doing is they&rsquo;re seeding the difference here is they&rsquo;re seeding control of the asset</p>
<p>To us investors and oversight by the u.s. Government versus the reverse which is trying to come in and buy an economic</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that that&rsquo;s not what syphilis adjudicates. It doesn&rsquo;t adjudicate. Where was this originated adjudicates in this cap table?</p>
<p>Does this person exist should they exist at what threshold?</p>
<p>What do they know and are we giving something that we shouldn&rsquo;t give and i&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>Yeah, let me give you another way of saying if the pragmatic answer is you can&rsquo;t just make up a bunch of stuff that</p>
<p>Blows up a bunch of other stuff. Let me frame it differently. What if by dance?</p>
<p>Sold tiktok us to a u.s. Own private equity consortium a u.s</p>
<p>Run private equity consortium that effectively bought tiktok us and operated in here in the u.s</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what should happen. But my point is those people are smart enough to not pay full price</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll say you&rsquo;re fucked that asset is worth zero</p>
<p>I will buy it for 10 billion dollars take it or leave it and you know what they&rsquo;ll have to do</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll have to take it. So my point is the equity value is so impaired in this thing</p>
<p>Will you buy that for 10 billion? Of course i&rsquo;m a buyer</p>
<p>But these guys are smart enough to drive a huge bargain a hard bargain</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re existing on the cap table, and you&rsquo;ve marked it at 320</p>
<p>I would be fucking selling it. Okay. Well look something like this is going to happen</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;ll be interesting to watch and</p>
<p>If any group of people got together and tried to actually buy it for what the fair market value</p>
<p>Is worth via a spreadsheet is a horrible investor in this moment</p>
<p>You should hold a gun to their head and you should extract a massive pound of flesh</p>
<p>That gives you a huge margin of safety and makes you money</p>
<p>We know people who are shareholders if they could have sold it at 320 or 120. They would have sold already</p>
<p>Well, no, there are there are people that will buy this thing in the hundreds</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in size</p>
<p>Then sell everything you can and then put it into another company</p>
<p>Now the problem is you have to show a markdown because you&rsquo;ve already marked it at 320</p>
<p>I gotta take a 65 discount</p>
<p>Yeah, if you&rsquo;re if if you&rsquo;re underwater you&rsquo;re underwater, but for anybody who got into the sub 1 billion round</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t eat irr and you can&rsquo;t eat paper markups. You can only eat the distribution</p>
<p>So get the dpi and move on is what I get the dpi and move on</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another bet you could place why try to okay be greedy and get the last 3x out of this investment</p>
<p>I want to move away from software meets leisure to software meets human health and productivity</p>
<p>A couple weeks ago. We were going to talk about this last week</p>
<p>It was announced that bio and tech was buying insta deep insta deep is a broad horizontal ai or machine learning tools company</p>
<p>Services business they partner with big businesses</p>
<p>to help them build out</p>
<p>ml driven infrastructure</p>
<p>To improve their products and their operations and their businesses</p>
<p>one of their</p>
<p>customers</p>
<p>Was bio and tech the company that?</p>
<p>designed and owned the ip</p>
<p>for the original pfizer covid vaccine one of the original originators of</p>
<p>Mrna based technology bio and tech</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t just focus on mrna technology. They also focus on cell and gene therapies the the novel</p>
<p>new kind of modalities that are emerging in</p>
<p>in therapeutics</p>
<p>And you know, it was a really interesting acquisition</p>
<p>It was a 250 I think person team that they bought the company for about 600 million dollars</p>
<p>Specifically to improve how ai can be used to accelerate drug discovery</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just make a comment on this and then sax i&rsquo;d love to kind of hear your point of view</p>
<p>on these types of businesses broadly</p>
<p>The capabilities of machine learning when applied to a particular vertical are quite profound</p>
<p>I you know, i&rsquo;ve certainly been involved in this space in agriculture and increasingly doing more of this work in pharmaceuticals and biotech</p>
<p>And you know when you can have large</p>
<p>Unique data sets that you can then model using these tools and these capabilities</p>
<p>And be predictive about what the next product iteration should be</p>
<p>It can really change the value and the trajectory of your business</p>
<p>One of the big trends in pharma right now is to move from in vitro testing</p>
<p>Meaning you&rsquo;re running biochemical experiments in labs in assays</p>
<p>iterating testing experimenting to see what molecules work or what protein</p>
<p>Does what and if it binds to the target and doing more of this in silica as it&rsquo;s being called</p>
<p>Which is in software and rather than just doing testing and software</p>
<p>You can actually use tools like alpha fold that can be predictive of large molecules and how they can drive outcomes</p>
<p>To make decisions about what to put in your pipeline</p>
<p>So if you take 99% of the junk out of the top of your pipeline</p>
<p>And you only focus on the 1% that the software predicts will be more successful</p>
<p>You much more quickly get drug discovery through the pipeline and you have a much higher hit rate</p>
<p>So the roi is extraordinary particularly when you&rsquo;re talking about multi-billion dollar revenue streams coming out the other end of that pipeline</p>
<p>And so I think you know the way this reads these guys raised 100 million dollars in a round last year</p>
<p>Sold the company for 600 million. It seems very similar to deep mind being bought by alphabet a few years ago</p>
<p>Where the application of the team is pretty broad across a number of opportunities</p>
<p>But bio and tech bought them to focus on the kind of pharma space</p>
<p>So I guess that&rsquo;s you know in in the earlier stage and you know</p>
<p>I see a lot of teams now that are like hey, we&rsquo;re ai for this or ml for that</p>
<p>a lot of</p>
<p>Pharma and biotech deals have to have the catchphrase ml or ai</p>
<p>Uh in their writing now because of the economic improvement of those businesses</p>
<p>Are you looking at enterprise software businesses that aren&rsquo;t necessarily about the typical?</p>
<p>Subscription model where you sell a seat license and people pay for that</p>
<p>But have this broad tool set and toolkit where these folks are earning revenue share or participating in a services revenue stream</p>
<p>For enhancing the value of their their their partner in the ai or ml space and what&rsquo;s the better business model?</p>
<p>Because I think this is where so many new teams are starting out</p>
<p>Is what&rsquo;s the business model and what should we be focused on with our ml toolkit?</p>
<p>I mean the short answer is no. We haven&rsquo;t done any deals like that</p>
<p>Uh, I mean, we&rsquo;re not pharma investors</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know how I would be able to evaluate even if it is a software product. I don&rsquo;t know how to evaluate its</p>
<p>effect on</p>
<p>pharma outcomes</p>
<p>So I mean we haven&rsquo;t any deals other verticals</p>
<p>I mean like do you look at ml and ai companies that are more services or partner oriented versus just selling seat licenses to a software</p>
<p>tool, I mean, is that a big trend you&rsquo;re seeing I don&rsquo;t think we have enough data to</p>
<p>Tell you what the trend is. We did a deal called pearl which is creating an ai for dentistry</p>
<p>So what it&rsquo;ll do is it scans in?</p>
<p>all of the x-rays and you know dental records from from dental practices and it gives a</p>
<p>Kind of a second opinion it can spot</p>
<p>Things like cavities and things like that or just changes in the condition where it&rsquo;s really powerful is over time, right?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s got your last</p>
<p>six sets of x-rays over a</p>
<p>Whatever six-year period it can detect changes that are probably, you know hard for a human to see</p>
<p>So they think they can get to like better than human sort of diagnosis</p>
<p>by using computer vision</p>
<p>and then we invested in</p>
<p>It sort of after that where we realized okay. This is kind of like a powerful application</p>
<p>So we invested in a company called robo flow</p>
<p>Which creates tools for computer vision so pearl created its own</p>
<p>tools for taking</p>
<p>A large number of you know x-rays and classifying them and then creating their own ai tools</p>
<p>Robo flow gives you that same tool set but you can run it on any computer vision project</p>
<p>And they seem to be building a pretty big universe</p>
<p>Of software developers who are using their tools and in this case, this was a team that was bought</p>
<p>They bought a 250 person team for 600 million dollars that just had this capability set really and a toolkit</p>
<p>Does that change your outlook for investing in ml ai companies when you see a 600 million dollar?</p>
<p>Exit for effectively a capability. They didn&rsquo;t have you know a core product that was in market</p>
<p>They were doing kind of these co-development deals</p>
<p>But I mean, how much does this sort of?</p>
<p>Ai is already the hot thing and everyone&rsquo;s kind of looking at this now</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know like I you never want to base an investment decision on the fact that</p>
<p>Some acquirer might come in and buy you for a large amount of money when you have no</p>
<p>revenue or</p>
<p>business model, I just think like that&rsquo;s not really a</p>
<p>Sustainable, although it does seem that</p>
<p>Ai engineers go for 2 million each. I think is kind of your point. Dave on an m&amp;a basis</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean your deep mind got bought for what 600 by google and I think they had 200 people. I think it was like 400</p>
<p>It was like 400. Yeah, so yeah</p>
<p>It does seem like and I think deep mind did not have a business</p>
<p>Concept in mind when they were funded. They just wanted to do research, right?</p>
<p>That was kind of the unique thing about that company platform capability similar to instant deep</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of these that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m pointing out is like some of these platform capabilities end up just getting bought for</p>
<p>You know huge sums. Yeah</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dangerous strategy as sax points out the amount</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t invest in a company hoping for an unreasonable acquisition meaning unreasonable meaning that reasonable acquire. Yeah</p>
<p>Yeah, like unreasonable meaning that your own metrics don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Reflect that valuation as a business. You might be worth it as a strategic acquisition of somebody else, but you you actually raise interesting</p>
<p>Question which is is a seat model</p>
<p>The right way for one of these companies to price their product and you may be right that that the seat license model doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really work because</p>
<p>Like how many seats do you really need to buy for these companies?</p>
<p>Look, I mean one of my like one prompt engineer. Yeah, it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve seen this we&rsquo;ve even seen we&rsquo;ve had these debates inside</p>
<p>the companies I mentioned where</p>
<p>Like, you know charging a ten dollar even a hundred dollar a month seat</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t nearly reflect the value of the insights that are being created</p>
<p>And so yeah, they&rsquo;re like, you know, they&rsquo;re I don&rsquo;t think this has been figured out yet</p>
<p>But this is the big question in mlna. I when I was at monsanto, you know, we had all this ip licensing deals</p>
<p>We do or um new products would come to market and it was never cost plus or simple pricing</p>
<p>It was always about value capture if in an enterprise setting, you know, because we sold to farmers</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like how much value are you delivering for the farmers if it&rsquo;s a hundred dollars of profit an acre</p>
<p>You try and charge an incremental thirty dollars an acre for that product</p>
<p>And it was always a one-third value capture model and the same is true in biotech and pharma</p>
<p>The producer of the product or the co-developer of the product is often trying to value capture</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not a site seat license and it&rsquo;s not a service fee</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more ultimately we want to get a royalty on the outcome on the improvement that we can deliver to you</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s all these novel business models that are emerging at least that i&rsquo;m seeing in pharma and biotech</p>
<p>To participate more meaningfully ultimately in the drug development outcome</p>
<p>Versus just getting charged a fee for doing a service or a fee for a license to a software packet</p>
<p>The value of these companies has gone down. I was a early investor series a investor in company called flat iron health</p>
<p>We sold it for 1.9 billion dollars to roche. That&rsquo;s the biggest exit in this space for this machine learning enabled stuff</p>
<p>It happened in 2018</p>
<p>And so what&rsquo;s really happened is the value of acquisition and m&amp;a has gone down</p>
<p>Even as the technology capability has gone way way up</p>
<p>And why is that it&rsquo;s because this stuff</p>
<p>Has yet to be proven to actually meaningfully</p>
<p>Improve the hit rate for these drug companies. So whether it&rsquo;s biotech or roche or anybody else the biggest problem we still have</p>
<p>Is getting the design space?</p>
<p>Guessing that</p>
<p>Better and these machines are better at doing raw calculations, but they&rsquo;re not necessarily better at</p>
<p>Veering towards this design space over this design space. And so as a result, you&rsquo;re not improving</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>Either the slugging percentage</p>
<p>Or the batting average of these pharma companies and that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re paying less and less</p>
<p>So everybody will have this capability as an adjunct</p>
<p>the thing that you have to do is sort of what</p>
<p>What you guys have said which is if there&rsquo;s a company that can actually do better guessing at the top of the funnel</p>
<p>The thing that you should probably do is just give it away in return for a back-end rev share</p>
<p>And a royalty and that business also exists so, you know</p>
<p>The best performing company in pharma is a company called royalty pharma</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a 22 and a half billion dollar company that has 90 ebitda margins. It exists in ireland</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s run in new york by this wonderful entrepreneur pablo lagareta</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what he does. He buys small pieces of royalties and his whole thing is like the paul graham thing at yc</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you just that little amount of support and all you need is a little lift in valuation to justify giving me the six</p>
<p>And the tooling company the ai company that does that</p>
<p>Could win who would go to roche and buy on tech or lily or somebody else and just say look use my tools</p>
<p>And whatever drug you generate off of me</p>
<p>I just want a three percent royalty and all you need to do is just show a three percent lift across a portfolio of assets</p>
<p>That would be a killer business model because if you look at what pablo&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>Over a large number of successes. That&rsquo;s a ginormous company</p>
<p>J cal I mean, are you investing in the seed stage ml ai companies and are there novel business models that you&rsquo;re seeing?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not seeing too many yet. To be honest. We have we are seeing people play with chat gpt and kind of</p>
<p>Do you know?</p>
<p>Experiments but you know</p>
<p>The more i&rsquo;ve used chat gpt. We&rsquo;ve connected it</p>
<p>to our slack</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>You can actually ask a question in our slack in a channel called ai testing</p>
<p>And it will give the answer and everybody can see people like playing with it</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s kind of like a parlor trick</p>
<p>Now i&rsquo;m in like</p>
<p>That phase where i&rsquo;m like, yeah, this is impressive</p>
<p>But it didn&rsquo;t actually solve my problem</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s slightly faster than doing a google search, so</p>
<p>I am thinking there&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>A really good business, uh created in taking</p>
<p>The open source projects and forking them and verticalizing them like, you know sax&rsquo;s</p>
<p>One that&rsquo;s doing dental work, you know, like this makes sense to me</p>
<p>Somebody should do it in accounting. Somebody should learn all of gap accounting, which is pretty simple because it&rsquo;s published</p>
<p>FASB all of this nonsensical accounting rules</p>
<p>And give you a hundred percent guarantee of no malfeasance</p>
<p>So, for example, you guys saw this brazilian company you want ai accounting that&rsquo;s your that&rsquo;s your look at this company</p>
<p>Logistics</p>
<p>Look at this company americanas in brazil, which just torched 20 billion dollars of enterprise value. Why?</p>
<p>Because these guys were using excel to do a bunch of complicated capitalization and cost accounting</p>
<p>Made two or three years of mistakes. It added up to two or three billion dollars</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re basically going to file bankruptcy in the next few days</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s completely avoidable human error. That should never happen</p>
<p>And an ai would be perfect for that. Like this is not super controversial to just follow gap accounting, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you need ai for that. I think you just need software like a database would be good</p>
<p>But no the problem is the database exists today. Like everybody sits on top of oracle gl or workday</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t prevent these errors</p>
<p>So my point is you got to get humans out of the system and the ai should be the accountant the ai knows the rules</p>
<p>Generates the pnl and says this is it and by the way</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s way better risk management for the ceo and the cfo because as you guys know if you&rsquo;re the ceo of a public company</p>
<p>You have to sign your signature that these things are legitimate</p>
<p>And how do you know?</p>
<p>I would way better know that a computer did it like an open ai algorithm tells me chamath this pnl is perfect</p>
<p>Than some dude, I don&rsquo;t know at ernst and young</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>I have a question for sax</p>
<p>Saxipu, can you please explain to me why alec baldwin is going to get charged with manslaughter for this rust thing?</p>
<p>That seems really crazy</p>
<p>Can you just say can you just explain what happens on a set with guns and how the hell did this happen?</p>
<p>Like what the hell is going on?</p>
<p>Well, i&rsquo;ve produced two movies, but neither one of them involved, you know guns or shootouts or anything like that</p>
<p>So I haven&rsquo;t had like first-hand experience with this. I have you&rsquo;re a gun owner</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re an intersection of movie producer and gun owner. So it&rsquo;s a good yeah</p>
<p>I understand the rules of gun safety and and that kind of stuff</p>
<p>look</p>
<p>Alec baldwin did not follow the rules of gun safety</p>
<p>the first thing I would do if I was ever handed a gun would be to</p>
<p>Clear it. I&rsquo;d like check to see if it was loaded and clear it</p>
<p>And you never pointed at you at somebody you always treat a gun as if it&rsquo;s loaded even if you think it&rsquo;s not but</p>
<p>He was in a very specific situation, which is he&rsquo;s on a movie set</p>
<p>And the person who&rsquo;s handing him the gun is the armorer</p>
<p>And said cold gun</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. It&rsquo;s somebody whose job it is to make sure that the gun is handled properly and unloaded and all that kind of stuff</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re using it on a set. So I agree with you. I don&rsquo;t quite understand why alec baldwin is liable</p>
<p>in that</p>
<p>Situation for the gun going off the person who screwed up here. The person who screwed up is the armor is the armor</p>
<p>I have a question person whose job it was to never allow live ammunition on the set</p>
<p>But to handle the guns properly, but he hired this person. I thought the whole point of guns and movies was that they were fine blanks</p>
<p>Yeah, they were firing blanks, but they had</p>
<p>Blanks and regular ones</p>
<p>In their kit for whatever reason because they were shooting real ones as well</p>
<p>But this is involuntary manslaughter and I think baldwin is also the producer of the film</p>
<p>So, I don&rsquo;t know if this has to do with his hiring of the armorer, you know what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>That I can that I can speak to listen. Yeah, you you frequently give stars in an independent movie a producer title</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not responsible for the physical production of the movie. I bet anything</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not there&rsquo;s a guy called the line producers responsible for the physical production</p>
<p>And my guess is he wasn&rsquo;t even responsible for the business side of the production</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got other producers for that</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me if they&rsquo;re going to charge him</p>
<p>For having some sort of overall liability as a producer to then not charge the other producers</p>
<p>That just doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. So I think this producer credit thing&rsquo;s probably a red herring</p>
<p>Like I said, I think the armorer is the person who is singularly responsible</p>
<p>For this situation. They&rsquo;re the ones who screwed up</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the ones who had a responsibility to make sure that the gun handed to an actor. I mean alec baldwin&rsquo;s an actor</p>
<p>Yeah, look conservatives in social media are dragging the guy because they think he&rsquo;s a douchebag and he doesn&rsquo;t know how to handle guns</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not his job. He doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s hired</p>
<p>In movies, why would you ever have live ammunition on a movie set? You shouldn&rsquo;t they shouldn&rsquo;t have you shouldn&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s a mistake</p>
<p>I was so so it&rsquo;s not as if like the scene is different if you have a real bullet versus a blank</p>
<p>No, it should as far as I know</p>
<p>If I remember right there was a story about how the gun armory people</p>
<p>were taking</p>
<p>Members of the cast and crew and they were shooting guns for fun in the desert</p>
<p>And they were doing like they were doing like targets and messing around and teaching people gun stuff and just playing around</p>
<p>But using live ammunition and that that led into an accident that there wasn&rsquo;t good kind of transition</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really bad. That sounds like the kind of negligence that caused this but I unless there are facts we don&rsquo;t know about</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why</p>
<p>By the way</p>
<p>That sounds totally legit to me</p>
<p>So guys listen, I need to run look another call</p>
<p>I was going to talk about this really fantastic paper</p>
<p>on the</p>
<p>One of the driving forces of aging as demonstrated by a team from harvard</p>
<p>in in collaboration with many others</p>
<p>on epigenetics</p>
<p>And the loss of data integrity in epigenetics really being the core driver of aging in mammalian cells</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredible paper. It speaks a lot to what we talked about last year yamanaka factors and partial epigenetic reprogramming of cells</p>
<p>How that can reverse aging these guys have demonstrated it in a really powerful way</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to spend some time on it. Maybe we pump that science corner to next week wrap up for today</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve talked about all sorts of fun stuff</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>A real pleasure and an honor to be in the seat of the world&rsquo;s greatest moderator. We miss him today</p>
<p>We honor him. We look forward to having his return next week. It&rsquo;s been a pleasure</p>
<p>Chatting with you gentlemen&rsquo;s and on behalf of the all-in pod and my co-hosts jamal polyhapitiya david sacks. Jason calacanis</p>
<p>Thank you for listening. Bye. Bye. Love you, boys. Bye</p>
<p>Rain man david</p>
<p>And instead we open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it</p>
<p>Love you</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they&rsquo;re all just useless</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension, but they just need to release it</p>
<p>Your feet</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going</p>
