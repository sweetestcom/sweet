    <p>We&rsquo;re just a mile south of Plymouth on Old 31 headed south to Argus.</p>
<p>Argus is about 15 minutes south of Plymouth, and it&rsquo;s mostly just cornfields and backroads</p>
<p>between the two towns.</p>
<p>Once you turn off of New US 31 onto Old Highway 31, you cross some railroad tracks, and a</p>
<p>few miles south of there, you pass right by Brandi Peltz&rsquo;s old house, where she was</p>
<p>murdered in 1986.</p>
<p>All right, well, let me get the feel here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll come up, the first one will be Peltz.</p>
<p>All right, I think Peltz is in the left-hand side with the trees here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s her.</p>
<p>Yeah, Peltz.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>This is episode nine.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go for a ride.</p>
<p>The Peltz house is right on the Tulane Highway.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a yellow two-story home with a front porch and a driveway to the right, with trees</p>
<p>and fields on either side.</p>
<p>By the way, we have photos from this ride along with Nelson.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re on our website, thedeckpodcast.com.</p>
<p>As you keep going by Brandi&rsquo;s old house, a few more miles south, and you come to 20B</p>
<p>Road, where the Holses lived.</p>
<p>Still gravel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s right here, the first house on the left.</p>
<p>Who lives there today?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There used to be a house there, but I don&rsquo;t think that was Grandpa&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I thought Grandpa was across the road.</p>
<p>Unlike the Peltz home, the Holses lived a little ways off Old 31, so you have to turn</p>
<p>onto 20B Road, which is unmarked.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a field before you get to their house on the left.</p>
<p>The ranch-style house is still there and looks similar to how it did in the 80s.</p>
<p>Same door, same windows, with a few updates to the siding and stuff.</p>
<p>Do you think that he was watching the house in the days leading up to August 17th?</p>
<p>Um, yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how studious, you know, how tense.</p>
<p>You saw, you know, you couldn&rsquo;t like park in a parking lot or something and watch.</p>
<p>So Nelson believes that the man went to Darlene&rsquo;s house with plans to sexually assault her,</p>
<p>but that the interaction turned too violent and then he panicked.</p>
<p>So I would think he&rsquo;s like, oh my God, I gotta, I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s breathing.</p>
<p>All right, I gotta, I gotta get rid of her, she&rsquo;s no longer a target of sex.</p>
<p>Nelson didn&rsquo;t know if Darlene was still alive when she was pulled from the house and placed</p>
<p>in the man&rsquo;s car.</p>
<p>If she was alive but unconscious, that would likely still cause her attacker to panic and flee.</p>
<p>Investigators think because of those skid marks that they saw at the end of the driveway,</p>
<p>the ones that I mentioned all the way back in episode one, that Darlene&rsquo;s abductor put</p>
<p>her in his car, backed out of the driveway, and then drove east, away from the highway.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the way Nelson drove Emily.</p>
<p>So you can see why instead of going back to that road, you&rsquo;d think he would go this way.</p>
<p>I would.</p>
<p>So this is the route you think the killer drove?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>With Darlene?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And he would have, if he&rsquo;s local, he&rsquo;s local.</p>
<p>He would have&hellip;</p>
<p>He would have known, he would have known that yeah, this is gonna be his escape route.</p>
<p>So where does this take us?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll take us to 110.</p>
<p>110 is really the county line road between Marshall and Fulton.</p>
<p>So, you know, no houses on here.</p>
<p>So that would have been another reason why I would think he would be comfortable about</p>
<p>going this would be his escape route.</p>
<p>Nelson thinks that the man drove the back roads in a square from the Hulse house to</p>
<p>avoid getting back onto the highway.</p>
<p>But he would have come to a highway and had to cross it in order to head west toward the</p>
<p>dirt road where he ended up leaving her body.</p>
<p>OK, we&rsquo;re looking for Olive.</p>
<p>Olive Trail, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Now, Olive Trail, you know, goes, I think, through the county.</p>
<p>But right here is going to be disjointed.</p>
<p>This is not unusual.</p>
<p>Olive Trail is just a few miles straight west of Darlene&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>And today it&rsquo;s still a dirt road, but it&rsquo;s a lot more open now, with a cornfield on one</p>
<p>side and some woods on the other.</p>
<p>Back in the 80s, it was woods on both sides, and the road was much more hidden than it</p>
<p>is today.</p>
<p>Just up here.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m reconstructing it myself, so, but I&rsquo;m fairly certain it&rsquo;s still these woods.</p>
<p>If you look, like I said, some of the crime scene, you know, somebody was taking old-fashioned</p>
<p>photos, and it was like a tunnel almost, because this was all those trees touching.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in here?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in here.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s so we can get out.</p>
<p>Where precisely, I do not know.</p>
<p>So you think the timber buyer finding here is a total coincidence?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>No, I&hellip;</p>
<p>Just asking questions.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling it was divine intervention, actually.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>I have some, yeah.</p>
<p>So help them out, go there.</p>
<p>Nelson definitely opened up a little during this ride along.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if it was getting him out of his stuffy office, or maybe he came around</p>
<p>to the idea of this podcast actually helping rather than hurting the investigation.</p>
<p>But it helped to have him share his thoughts about the case while literally looking at</p>
<p>the crime scene.</p>
<p>He thinks whoever killed Darlene knew exactly where he was going to take her the whole time,</p>
<p>that he planned it.</p>
<p>If he was worried about the daughters having escaped to go get help,</p>
<p>he was probably thinking like, oh, the police are about to be on their way.</p>
<p>Yes, but I think about, you know, levels of communication, radio or otherwise,</p>
<p>you know, telephone, you know, they would have converged on the scene.</p>
<p>They would not necessarily be looking, you know, know where he was going.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But that would be another reason to go that way rather than back this way.</p>
<p>But you notice that there wasn&rsquo;t a house on that thing other than that,</p>
<p>that one we saw, but I don&rsquo;t, that didn&rsquo;t exist then.</p>
<p>And he had to know that.</p>
<p>If he was going to have sex and then kill, that might have always been his end place.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re keeping up with Nelson&rsquo;s riddles, it&rsquo;s apparent that he thinks the killer has</p>
<p>strong ties to the exact spot he left Darlene.</p>
<p>But anytime Emily brings that up, he deflects or changes the subject pretty quickly.</p>
<p>So do you know anything else about the people who owned that land back in the day or?</p>
<p>Um, I can pull out because I know I have them in there somewhere.</p>
<p>You know, an old plat map that gave us the name.</p>
<p>And when the landowner was questioned?</p>
<p>That I don&rsquo;t recall any specific thing.</p>
<p>You know, he was just a, you know, they were not thinking of him.</p>
<p>They must have talked to him.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Just to even ask, you know, to fit the pulses, I would think.</p>
<p>What is this, a fire truck?</p>
<p>Nelson either got distracted by a fire truck driving by or he was trying to change the</p>
<p>subject.</p>
<p>But before he took Emily back to her car, he said, I&rsquo;ll show you one more place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this property that belongs to a longtime local family who used to bury cars in their yard.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s still a buried bus there today.</p>
<p>Back there is where the buried bus.</p>
<p>Oh, back here?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Down this drive?</p>
<p>Yeah, back behind that house.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to get a very good photo, so it&rsquo;s creepy, major creepy.</p>
<p>Emily wasn&rsquo;t totally sure why this place warranted a stop.</p>
<p>The rumor about the buried bus wasn&rsquo;t new to us,</p>
<p>but we hadn&rsquo;t seen any records that tied that property or the family necessarily to Darlene&rsquo;s</p>
<p>case yet.</p>
<p>I mean, other than like the obvious assumption any armchair detective could make, which is</p>
<p>that burying a vehicle that everyone is on the lookout for is one way to make sure that</p>
<p>it never gets found.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, I had dreams of finding the head of the fireplace poker in the&hellip;</p>
<p>In the bus?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I, I mean, how would you explain that, please?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not&hellip;</p>
<p>Nothing, nothing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not exactly wild speculation to think that like something like that could happen,</p>
<p>because that is very unusual.</p>
<p>What, the buried bus?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not very far away.</p>
<p>But then Nelson said,</p>
<p>but you know, the family who lived there was never suspected in the Hulse murder.</p>
<p>They were sort of looked at for Brandy Peltz&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>And this is where things get really fuzzy, because Nelson couldn&rsquo;t remember for sure,</p>
<p>but he said he thought police even dug through that yard looking for evidence in the Peltz</p>
<p>case, but that they didn&rsquo;t find anything.</p>
<p>And you can tell that Nelson is still suspicious of the people who lived there,</p>
<p>because he keeps mentioning this small geographic triangle.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a triangle.</p>
<p>Peltz, Hulse, buried bus.</p>
<p>If you draw a line from Darlene&rsquo;s house to Brandy&rsquo;s house to the buried bus property,</p>
<p>back to Darlene&rsquo;s house, it makes a little triangle.</p>
<p>So Nelson keeps pointing that out,</p>
<p>but then he&rsquo;ll say that the buried bus has nothing to do with Darlene as far as he knows.</p>
<p>Sometimes talking to Nelson is like trying to swim through mud.</p>
<p>On one hand, it was great to get more bits and pieces of info about Darlene&rsquo;s case,</p>
<p>but sometimes we came away from him more confused than ever.</p>
<p>And right now was one of those times.</p>
<p>We just had this weird puzzle piece that we weren&rsquo;t even sure fit the puzzle we were working</p>
<p>on.</p>
<p>But we held on to it anyways.</p>
<p>And in a few episodes, you&rsquo;ll be glad you held on to it too.</p>
<p>As Nelson was driving Emily back to her car,</p>
<p>he comes as close as ever to hinting at who his main suspect is.</p>
<p>Do you think the person who killed Darlene went on to commit more violent crime?</p>
<p>Or do you think that they&rsquo;ve gone pretty much undetected all of these years, or both?</p>
<p>I think there was another assault after that.</p>
<p>After that, I think there might have been some deviant stuff, you know, like</p>
<p>maybe exposure or something.</p>
<p>Deviant type?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I think he paid for one of them.</p>
<p>And he paid in the sense of a conviction for one of them.</p>
<p>And might have learned to stay back, you know, to suppress it.</p>
<p>I cannot believe the system rehabilitated him.</p>
<p>I believe he&rsquo;d still have the urges, whether he acted out on them or not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pure conjecture.</p>
<p>Deviant stuff.</p>
<p>Exposure.</p>
<p>He paid for that.</p>
<p>That was sounding a lot like one man.</p>

<p>If you remember from Episode 7, we knew Kenneth McCune Jr.</p>
<p>was at least questioned about Darlene back in the 80s</p>
<p>after he was arrested for the break-in and attempted rape of Pam.</p>
<p>But up to this point, we had no idea if he was still being looked at in relation to Darlene&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Nelson won&rsquo;t confirm on record that Kenneth McCune Jr.</p>
<p>is an official suspect or even person of interest.</p>
<p>But that ride-along left me and Emily with a lot of questions, specifically about Kenneth.</p>
<p>And we had a really clear idea of what we needed to do next.</p>
<p>Not to beat this puzzle analogy into the ground, but it seemed to us like everyone kept trying</p>
<p>to make the puzzle work with the same couple of pieces,</p>
<p>smashing them together over and over for three decades.</p>
<p>But we had this sneaking suspicion that the picture might be a lot bigger than anyone ever knew.</p>
<p>So Emily left that ride-along with Nelson and went straight to the Marshall County Courthouse</p>
<p>to dig up some records on Kenneth McCune Jr.</p>
<p>In Indiana, court records searches have to be done in person at most courthouses.</p>
<p>And you have to be armed with enough information like a suspect&rsquo;s full name,</p>
<p>date of birth, and case number to even get access to criminal case files.</p>
<p>And sometimes it&rsquo;s even trickier than that.</p>
<p>A court clerk might take your request and tell you to come back in two days</p>
<p>once they have time to locate the records.</p>
<p>Or sometimes they&rsquo;ll find the records right away,</p>
<p>but make you name specific documents that you want to see.</p>
<p>Which is such a catch-22 because it&rsquo;s impossible to name the exact document</p>
<p>until you have access to the old dockets,</p>
<p>unless you just asked to see the PC affidavit.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s often just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>In the McCune case, we got a helpful clerk who went to the basement</p>
<p>and dug up his files from the 80s.</p>
<p>But then she spent like an hour going through the folders with a supervisor</p>
<p>and pulling out information that they thought should be redacted.</p>
<p>After that, Emily was allowed to thumb through the files</p>
<p>and pay for copies of the ones she wanted.</p>
<p>But it was worth the trouble,</p>
<p>because that record search was the key that unlocked so much information for us.</p>
<p>Names, dates, interview transcripts, even witness lists.</p>
<p>Included in those names was Kenneth McCune&rsquo;s previous victim,</p>
<p>who we&rsquo;d been calling Pam to protect her identity.</p>
<p>Pam had never spoken publicly about her attack as far as we could find.</p>
<p>And we knew that if we were really going to understand what happened to her</p>
<p>and determine if there were any similarities between her attack and other cases,</p>
<p>we couldn&rsquo;t go off a short one-page report or blurbs in old newspapers.</p>
<p>We needed to talk to the woman who lived it.</p>
<p>So Emily reached out to her.</p>
<p>And to our surprise, she was willing to tell her story.</p>
<p>Do you remember what you were doing that day?</p>
<p>Yeah, I was sleeping.</p>
<p>It was very early morning.</p>
<p>And the phone rang.</p>
<p>And the person on the other end of the phone asked if my husband was home.</p>
<p>And I said, no, he won&rsquo;t be home till night after work.</p>
<p>And so, like, okay.</p>
<p>And then hung up, went back to bed.</p>
<p>About 30 minutes later, Pam woke up to a loud noise,</p>
<p>like a crashing sound coming from the front of her house.</p>
<p>Her dog started barking its head off, so Pam got up to investigate.</p>
<p>I just thought, oh my gosh, what fell?</p>
<p>And so I jumped out of bed.</p>
<p>And by the time I took just one step to the doorway,</p>
<p>he was already running down the hall to me, about maybe 20 feet away.</p>
<p>It was dark in Pam&rsquo;s house because all the shades were drawn.</p>
<p>So Pam said really all she could see was this big figure running toward her.</p>
<p>What was going through your mind right then?</p>
<p>Just panic, I guess.</p>
<p>Just shock.</p>
<p>Like, there was nothing going through my mind other than disbelief, I guess.</p>
<p>At what point did reality set in?</p>
<p>I took, as he approached, I took a step backwards.</p>
<p>And of course, it was a small room, so I was right there at the bed.</p>
<p>And he had grabbed my arms and pushed me back onto the bed.</p>
<p>And I was screaming by that point.</p>
<p>And he said, shut up or I&rsquo;ll, what I thought was, stick you, is what I thought I heard.</p>
<p>And then when I realized he had hold of both of my arms,</p>
<p>I realized he didn&rsquo;t have a knife or something in his hands.</p>
<p>So then I fought harder.</p>
<p>Pam said when she realized he wasn&rsquo;t holding a weapon,</p>
<p>she thought, I&rsquo;m not just going to lay here and take this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to fight.</p>
<p>I was angry then.</p>
<p>Self-defense mode angry.</p>
<p>What happened after that?</p>
<p>Whatever gave him the change of mind or heart,</p>
<p>he just got up and took off and ran back down the hall and to the front door.</p>
<p>How long do you feel like you were struggling with him?</p>
<p>I would say maybe 30 seconds to a minute is all that that whole incident took.</p>
<p>Um, as I got up, uh, after he left or got up,</p>
<p>I grabbed a drinking glass that I had full of water on the nightstand</p>
<p>and chased down the hall.</p>
<p>And I actually threw it at him at the front door as he left.</p>
<p>Kudos to Pam for throwing a glass at that motherfucker&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the glass just missed him and hit the door instead.</p>
<p>But the intruder didn&rsquo;t leave unscathed.</p>
<p>He cut his hand on the doorway as he was running out,</p>
<p>leaving his blood at the scene of the crime.</p>
<p>Pam didn&rsquo;t follow him outside.</p>
<p>Instead, she ran to the bay window in her house</p>
<p>and peered out to see what kind of car he was in.</p>
<p>It was one that she&rsquo;d never seen before.</p>
<p>I could tell it was a truck with a camper on the back</p>
<p>because the sun was starting to come up a little bit by then.</p>
<p>And I thought, well, that must have been who it was</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s nobody else that has gone by.</p>
<p>You know, no other cars were around.</p>
<p>Pam immediately called police after that.</p>
<p>They responded to her house.</p>
<p>And once she told them what had happened,</p>
<p>officers decided that Pam was likely being stalked by this man,</p>
<p>not just because of the phone call right before he broke in,</p>
<p>but because of the other phone calls that she had gotten as well.</p>
<p>The summer prior, I had received obscene phone calls.</p>
<p>And I had gone to the sheriff&rsquo;s department and filed a complaint</p>
<p>and put what they could as far as a tracer on the phone.</p>
<p>But then, of course, there weren&rsquo;t any more calls until that morning.</p>
<p>So the police immediately, pretty immediately,</p>
<p>said that he was there to hurt me because I just couldn&rsquo;t imagine.</p>
<p>I thought, well, maybe it was just a break-in.</p>
<p>And of course, they&rsquo;re like, OK, with the phone call and all of that.</p>
<p>It was more premeditated.</p>
<p>And he was here to do something to you.</p>
<p>In the first two calls Pam had gotten,</p>
<p>the man called her by her longtime nickname,</p>
<p>which made her wonder if the guy knew her.</p>
<p>But Pam didn&rsquo;t recognize his voice.</p>
<p>All of the calls were sexual.</p>
<p>He would tell her what he wanted to do to her.</p>
<p>Pam never responded and would just hang up.</p>
<p>She said based on his voice alone,</p>
<p>she couldn&rsquo;t tell if the man who attacked her was the same man who&rsquo;d been calling.</p>
<p>But police thought it was very likely.</p>
<p>Just 20 months later, when Darlene&rsquo;s body was found so close to Pam&rsquo;s house,</p>
<p>she wondered if the same man was back.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not my job to prove or disprove,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of links and similarities.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know at the time before my attack</p>
<p>that he had baled hay right around behind us.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that till after the investigation began with him.</p>
<p>And then, of course, when they found Darlene&rsquo;s body,</p>
<p>it was immediately behind our house.</p>
<p>And so the helicopters ascended, all of the police ascended,</p>
<p>and I got in my car.</p>
<p>Well, we could watch it all from our yard.</p>
<p>And I got in my car and I went down to the officers who had the road blocked off.</p>
<p>And I said, you know, I said I wasn&rsquo;t killed,</p>
<p>but I was attacked and my home was broken into.</p>
<p>So I feel like it&rsquo;s similar enough,</p>
<p>and this is close enough to where this happened,</p>
<p>to where Darlene lived, that it warrants investigation.</p>
<p>They seemed to take her seriously, but as far as she could tell,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t really dig deeper into any potential connection at the time.</p>
<p>So as an investigation into Darlene&rsquo;s case got underway,</p>
<p>Pam was just left to wonder if her attacker was still out there</p>
<p>and if he might come back.</p>
<p>It was, it was living hell.</p>
<p>And, you know, a lot to come to terms with as a young woman.</p>
<p>So different measures.</p>
<p>We took different measures, you know, put up a fence, got an outside dog.</p>
<p>People stayed with me for probably a good six months.</p>
<p>When Pam&rsquo;s attacker was finally caught in the winter of 1987,</p>
<p>the name Kenneth McCune Jr. barely rang a bell.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t know him personally.</p>
<p>She just said that she knew his little sister</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;d gone to high school together in Culver.</p>
<p>But that was it.</p>
<p>And at the time of his arrest in 87 and the sentencing in 88,</p>
<p>Darlene&rsquo;s case was already cold.</p>
<p>And the only thing even remotely linking Kenneth McCune Jr. to Darlene</p>
<p>was a bunch of weird coincidences.</p>
<p>We talked in terms of coincidence.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t prove a case on coincidence, but man, that&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a lot of coincidence.</p>
<p>We find even more coincidences in episode 10,</p>
<p>Look at the Deeds.</p>
<p>You can listen to that right now.</p>
