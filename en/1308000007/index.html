    <p>All right, everybody, welcome back. It&rsquo;s another episode of All In Podcast, the podcast that is</p>
<p>racing up the charts despite the fact that we record it every three or four weeks. There&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>marketing. There&rsquo;s no ads in this podcast. It&rsquo;s just four friends who play poker together who&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>decided to talk about the most important issues in the world. Welcome back to the podcast,</p>
<p>David Friedberg, the queen of quinoa himself. Obviously, climate.com eats and an undisclosed</p>
<p>beverage startup that I&rsquo;m not supposed to talk about. Sorry about that. I know a lot of people</p>
<p>were tweeting about this beverage startup. You&rsquo;re still not ready to talk about the</p>
<p>beverage startup. Thank you, Jay Pal. Yep. Welcome back. I always appreciate your promotions.</p>
<p>But when will the beverage startup? By the way, do you guys want to talk about Jason&rsquo;s</p>
<p>home address? Because I have that, I think. Please, no. I want to ask, is that a picture</p>
<p>in the background? I love space, by the way, as you know, but is that a picture of Uranus</p>
<p>or what is that picture? I think that&rsquo;s Saturn. It&rsquo;s Saturn. It&rsquo;s not Saturn.</p>
<p>Friedberg, obviously taking the first Virgin Galactic flight. Chamath Palihapitiya, of course,</p>
<p>with us here. The prince of SPACs calling in from an undisclosed location that is not burning down</p>
<p>like the United States. How are you doing on your vacay? Doing really well. Thanks. I&rsquo;m giving you</p>
<p>the three-button salute, as I told you. Yeah, thank God the microphone is perfectly positioned</p>
<p>so we do not have to look at your chest hair, all six of your chest hairs. Oh my God.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a thousand-dollar suit that&rsquo;s missing all of its buttons, or shirt, rather. I mean,</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t afford to put buttons all the way up on your, like, probably $2,000 shirt.</p>
<p>Austerity measures. When I get back to the United States, as Jason said,</p>
<p>my haberdasher will meet me at plain sight and show the three buttons.</p>
<p>Yeah, when he leaves for Europe, they remove the three buttons, he comes back,</p>
<p>the haberdasher puts them back on each shirt. He does that for the entire wardrobe. And, of course,</p>
<p>chiming in is Rain Man himself, David Sachs, professional blogger and the fund manager of</p>
<p>Kraft Ventures, of course, before that working at PayPal with Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, and a</p>
<p>bunch of other famous people, two of which have gone on to have demonstrably more success</p>
<p>than Sachs, but Sachs having, of course, more than success, demonstrable success,</p>
<p>than the other 72 rocket scientists from PayPal. In between, he did a little company called Yammer,</p>
<p>which Microsoft bought for a billion dollars. Speaking of big companies and big tech,</p>
<p>we had a big tech hearing this week, and Jeff Bezos, Sundar, and Zuck himself,</p>
<p>as well as Tim Cook, two founders and two hired guns, people who were hired for their positions,</p>
<p>defending themselves from what I thought was some pretty good questioning. My expectations</p>
<p>were very low that anybody on that panel would know what they were talking about.</p>
<p>For me, I thought Jeff Bezos did the best job. He had a great opening statement,</p>
<p>and he was the most candid, and I think least likely to get broken up.</p>
<p>Going around the horn here, Chamath, who did the best job in the hearings? I don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>you saw all of them or just clips, but who do you think shined?</p>
<p>I only saw, to be honest with you, your recap, which I thought was, frankly, really, really good,</p>
<p>and we should probably link to that in the show notes so people can listen to it.</p>
<p>I saw a couple of answers. The thing that jumped off the page to me was I read a little bit of</p>
<p>Bezos&rsquo; statement. I thought it was pretty fire. I thought he did the best job positioning himself,</p>
<p>but the reality is it&rsquo;s what I said a few days earlier on CNBC, but I just thought going in,</p>
<p>this whole thing was set up to be performative theater, and it basically was that. The level of</p>
<p>questions are just so poor. The level of understanding is so bad, and then people</p>
<p>just use it as a way to grandstand, and everybody did. I wasn&rsquo;t completely blown away by any of it,</p>
<p>to be quite honest. What do you think, Friedberg? Who had the best showing in those hearings?</p>
<p>I think Zuck was the most eloquent in the on-point responses. He was super, super well-prepped for</p>
<p>this thing. I think Bezos and others, they had great prep work done for their statement,</p>
<p>but in terms of warding off the attacks, I think Zuck did a great job. It was weird. It didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>feel like Tim Cook should have been there. It was a random thing that he was there because</p>
<p>everyone had an ax to grind, and the ax that everyone had to grind was a little bit different.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t like this was a true objective discussion about antitrust, and so the ax</p>
<p>that people had to grind were pointed at Google and Facebook and Amazon in different ways.</p>
<p>Tim Cook was, hey, yeah, this is cool. You guys go ahead and give your responses. I&rsquo;m going to go</p>
<p>back to work. Do you think that&rsquo;s because Apple does not have a monopoly position on a numbers</p>
<p>basis in any one era, and or because their products are so loved and universally used?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s actually a function of what these companies do. If you look at the Jim Jordan rant,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you guys watched this, but Jim Jordan did this big rant at the opening.</p>
<p>He was the worst.</p>
<p>And he went on and on. The first thing he said, he&rsquo;s like, big tech is out to get conservatives,</p>
<p>and then he went on and gave all these examples about how Twitter has been pulling down Donald</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s tweets and flagging them, and Facebook&rsquo;s been cancelling certain people on the platform.</p>
<p>His whole ax to grind was really about censorship on social media platforms,</p>
<p>which has fucking nothing to do with antitrust and has nothing to do with Apple&rsquo;s business.</p>
<p>I guess my point is, and then other people have issues with Google&rsquo;s dominance in ads and Amazon&rsquo;s</p>
<p>impact on local business. There wasn&rsquo;t much of an ax to grind, frankly, with Apple.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, as I said, I just don&rsquo;t think that it was a function of,</p>
<p>you know, a true kind of objective antitrust approach. And it was just more about like,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;ve all got different things we want to address. And we finally got these guys here,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s beat them up. And, you know,</p>
<p>Saks, what do you think you with Friedberg that it was performance art? Or do you think that</p>
<p>or performative rather, do you or do you think that there are actually substantive</p>
<p>issues that came up during the hearings that we should discuss here?</p>
<p>Well, you know, it was both, you know, certainly there was a tremendous amount of grandstanding</p>
<p>and political theater and the politicians on both sides wanted to take shots at the</p>
<p>companies for various reasons. I mean, I think they have a slightly different hierarchy of hate.</p>
<p>I think the left sort of hates Facebook the most because they blame it for Trump&rsquo;s election,</p>
<p>which I think is kind of a ridiculous scapegoating, which we should talk more about.</p>
<p>But and then I think the right is most suspicious towards Google. But I think there are, you know,</p>
<p>legitimate issues here as that were brought up. And I think the congressional hearing</p>
<p>did score some hit points. Your previous pod did a good job showing some of those.</p>
<p>These hearings were teed up, apparently, over the past year by</p>
<p>a series of subpoenas of records that the committee, this is the House</p>
<p>subcommittee on antitrust had teed up. And so there were some moments where I thought that,</p>
<p>you know, the representative scored some hits on, you know, Facebook and Google.</p>
<p>Who took the biggest hit in all of this? Who do you think has the most, putting aside all this</p>
<p>performance, obviously, and the politicization of everything in our country, and Jim Jordan,</p>
<p>who to me is like the, he&rsquo;s like the dad at the baseball game who like, the Little League game</p>
<p>who runs on the court and pushes the umpire and gets banned for the season. Like he just</p>
<p>yells over everybody for no reason. But what is the actual, what was the punch that landed</p>
<p>that is the most valid, as we go around the horn one more time here, now that we&rsquo;ve got our initial</p>
<p>thoughts about it, what punch landed the squarest in one of these companies&rsquo; faces?</p>
<p>Well, let me set this up. I think there were three big areas of concern where just about all</p>
<p>the companies, with maybe the exception of Amazon, took hits, although even, you know, Bezos took</p>
<p>hits. I think one is with respect to anti-competitive actions that these platforms are</p>
<p>taking, particularly with respect to the applications or small businesses that operate</p>
<p>and are dependent on those platforms. I think all of the companies were interrogated about that.</p>
<p>You know, Bezos took a hit when he had to admit or concede that the company may not have always</p>
<p>followed its policy with respect to using its, you know, third-party sellers&rsquo; data to figure</p>
<p>out how to compete with them. You know, Google was interrogated about snippets. This is a big</p>
<p>snippet. There was news today, actually, just out of Australia, that the government&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to order Google to pay small businesses for the use of its content for snippets, which,</p>
<p>you know, so the regulations are kind of heating up on this. But sort of the first area was sort</p>
<p>of anti-competitive, and I think Facebook took some hits with respect to the Instagram acquisition,</p>
<p>which, you know, Congressman Nadler really went after him, and then I think</p>
<p>Jayapal as well. And that&rsquo;s a tremendously threatening issue for Facebook, because if</p>
<p>it is forced to divest Instagram, it would just be crippling for the company.</p>
<p>All right, so let&rsquo;s, yeah, let&rsquo;s take, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Just to, Jason, just set the table. Two other issues that I think came up, I&rsquo;ll just very</p>
<p>briefly. Number two is sort of cozying up to China. I think Google is the one that&rsquo;s most</p>
<p>vulnerable here. And then the third issue is sort of this issue of censorship and bias</p>
<p>with respect to content and politics in the election.</p>
<p>Which has nothing to do with, which has nothing to do with antitrust, the censorship issue. So</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s table that one. That one.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re hitting the nail on the head. This was not about antitrust going in. I think people</p>
<p>were, you know, kind of confused. Even Jim Jordan, just, I don&rsquo;t think he has any clue</p>
<p>what he&rsquo;s talking about. He doesn&rsquo;t know the difference between regulation and antitrust.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t know the difference between the Sherman Act and like, you know, Section 230.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re all kind of making it up as they go along. So in many ways, I think personally</p>
<p>that the companies that were the most at risk going in were the same companies at risk coming</p>
<p>out. And so, you know, if you had to stack rank to risk, I think Facebook is number one at the</p>
<p>top of the list. Then I think it&rsquo;s Google. Then I think it&rsquo;s Apple. And then I think far, far,</p>
<p>far down is Amazon. In many ways, Amazon is the most inoculated simply because</p>
<p>the end market that they operate in is so massive. And the market that Facebook operates in</p>
<p>is so new, yet so constrained with very few competitors. So in many ways, I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how the risk cuts. I really think that the antitrust legislative framework that exists</p>
<p>today isn&rsquo;t enough to touch any of these guys. Instead, I think what really happens is more</p>
<p>regulatory. And if you really think about what these guys are very concerned about,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more that Facebook largely, and then Google to a smaller degree, essentially can be kingmakers</p>
<p>with respect to popular opinion and sentiment. And I think that they want to have regulations.</p>
<p>And I think that there&rsquo;s a good historical precedent for a bunch of industries</p>
<p>that have had to come under regulation when they effectively get to 100% distribution,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s meat or airplanes or radio or television, agriculture writ large,</p>
<p>automobiles and transportation. Whenever a market basically serves 100% of the total</p>
<p>addressable universe, governments step in. And they don&rsquo;t necessarily legislate and trust bust.</p>
<p>They fundamentally regulate and tax. And I think in many ways, that&rsquo;s just as bad. And frankly,</p>
<p>in some ways, it&rsquo;s worse. Because if you do that to a tech company, you&rsquo;re basically crippling</p>
<p>the one thing that they&rsquo;re supposed to be very good at, which is to innovate. And that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>only thing that they can use to basically keep their stock price high, which is then the only</p>
<p>thing that they can use to get people to continue to work for them. So that&rsquo;s the sort of circular</p>
<p>loop that breaks if you regulate them. And I think that the risk coming in was the same as coming up.</p>
<p>So Facebook, let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s take them. Let&rsquo;s take them one at a time. Facebook, I thought had the</p>
<p>worst performance because it was pretty clear that Nadler was setting them up not only to not be able</p>
<p>to buy a company in the future. But in that clip, he was sort of teeing them up that maybe the</p>
<p>Instagram acquisition should be unwound and they should be forced to spin that off. Because they</p>
<p>were saying over and over and over again, that Zuckerberg put in emails with his management</p>
<p>team that they were going to buy these companies or kill them or copy their feature sets. And even</p>
<p>though that may not be explicitly illegal, the fact that they&rsquo;ve hit as Chamath is talking about</p>
<p>such incredible market share with billions of users, and because of the track record of Zuckerberg,</p>
<p>you know, which may not be at all related to this, but it sets the table.</p>
<p>No, but Jason, in fairness to Mark, that decision wasn&rsquo;t made when Facebook had market dominance.</p>
<p>That decision was made when Facebook was still fundamentally at risk. And there was a large</p>
<p>period of time where a lot of other people had they been left to their own devices or properly</p>
<p>capitalized, could have actually become a relatively, you know, important competitor to</p>
<p>Facebook, Instagram could have been at that point. But then Snapchat was the opposite Snapchat,</p>
<p>they were at scale, and then they were going to buy it and threaten them. Either you sell to us,</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re going to copy the features. I think I think I think what a more</p>
<p>logical and defensible reaction. Like, I just think it&rsquo;s not defensible to say,</p>
<p>oh, you know, at Facebook, I didn&rsquo;t like the acquisition you did 10 years ago,</p>
<p>basically, because it worked. Yeah. And so I&rsquo;m going to punish you 10 years later. That&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s stupid. Yeah. In the review mirror. No, no good. Yeah. A more reasonable place to be is to</p>
<p>say, okay, this thing, meaning communications writ large, has become a critical piece of societal</p>
<p>infrastructure. And we are trying to figure out now what the rules should be. And rules shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be brittle rules should be evolutionary, they should map, you know, to the moral decisions and</p>
<p>ideas and frameworks of the time. And so, you know, we have to figure out, for example, number</p>
<p>one, interoperability. So how can you message across all these multiple networks? You know,</p>
<p>another simple example, you know, we legislated the ability for emergency services to be able to</p>
<p>send a message on your mobile phone line and your landline, you should probably be able to have a</p>
<p>backdoor into all the messaging networks simply for that reason. So the point is that, you know,</p>
<p>there are all kinds of things you can do today to make this infrastructure layer of society</p>
<p>operate in a more predictable way on behalf of what was your best you have you thought about</p>
<p>a regulation, then let&rsquo;s stick to Facebook, and then we&rsquo;ll go to Amazon. Chamath, have you thought</p>
<p>about a regulation that would make sense to Facebook, whether it&rsquo;s divesting an asset,</p>
<p>or maybe a certain percentage of usage or allowing Facebook Messenger to work with iMessenger to work</p>
<p>with, you know, Twitter DMs? I&rsquo;ll answer it in different ways. So look, I mean, for 20 years,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve run these kind of businesses, like from, from Winamp to AIM and ICQ to then, you know,</p>
<p>at Facebook. And so, you know, I remember in at AIM and ICQ, we, you know, did all this hand</p>
<p>wringing and all these meetings between us and Microsoft and Yahoo, to make our messaging</p>
<p>networks interoperate. And, you know, eventually, we were basically just cut off at the knees,</p>
<p>because other people just moved around us. And eventually, it all just morphed anyways away from</p>
<p>these sort of brittle messaging networks. My, my kind of view is that I think what&rsquo;s best for</p>
<p>Facebook is a status quo. And so, you know, if they can basically, and by the way, I think the</p>
<p>strategy is and Mark wrote this in his manifesto, but a couple of years ago, you know, this is sort</p>
<p>of what led to Chris Cox resigning, if I&rsquo;m playing, you know, sort of like conspiracy theorists,</p>
<p>if you read Zuck&rsquo;s manifesto, what he was basically saying is, listen, we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>take all these product, and we&rsquo;re going to take all that code, and we&rsquo;re going to mesh them all</p>
<p>together in such a complicated, convoluted mess that if and when somebody ever tells us to rip</p>
<p>it apart, it&rsquo;ll take another five or 10 years to do it. And that&rsquo;s effectively the technical read</p>
<p>on that manifesto. It&rsquo;s just like, you&rsquo;re going to make it technically impossible to unthread</p>
<p>these things as independent. And your thesis is that&rsquo;s a strategy against an antitrust breakup. I</p>
<p>find that no, I just think it&rsquo;s a really smart strategy. I mean, he wrote it, and he published</p>
<p>it online. So it&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s hiding anything. He made it right. I mean, it&rsquo;s the beautiful part</p>
<p>about it. He made it completely in the clear. Now. So that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s the strategy is to basically</p>
<p>make it one monolithic code base so that if and when I think I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m not sure if this is the</p>
<p>intention, but frankly, if and when somebody knocked on the door and said, hey, you need to</p>
<p>strip apart WhatsApp and Messenger and Instagram, you can say, well, look, it&rsquo;s one monolithic code</p>
<p>base of, you know, 50 million lines of code, it&rsquo;ll take me 10 years, but sure, I&rsquo;ll figure it out</p>
<p>somehow. So yeah, you know, I think what&rsquo;s good for Facebook is a status quo. Now that&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>from what&rsquo;s good for politicians. And then what&rsquo;s different for consumers, I think what&rsquo;s good for</p>
<p>consumers is fundamental interoperability. Now, this is then what touches, you know, Android and</p>
<p>Apple as well, like the idea today that you cannot have a group text message that can only include</p>
<p>iPhones, you know, on the off chance one of your friends is an Android phone, you&rsquo;re basically</p>
<p>fucked is kind of which happens every six months on our group that Freeberg, what do you think,</p>
<p>in terms of Facebook, and any potential action that could be taken? Or any possible solution</p>
<p>to them having such a dominant position, because they are the only one of the four</p>
<p>that has a dominant position? I would think about the, you know, how these businesses</p>
<p>are kind of built right there in all these businesses, there&rsquo;s an infrastructure layer,</p>
<p>the infrastructure layer, in the case of Google and Facebook is reasonably similar,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a bunch of data centers and hardware and software infrastructure to run all of their</p>
<p>services on top. And then on top, there are consumer products, and then there are advertising</p>
<p>products and the and the customer base for the consumer product is obviously users and the,</p>
<p>you know, customer base for the advertising products is these advertisers that pay to access</p>
<p>these consumers and give them ads and get clicks from them and sell them stuff. And so if you think</p>
<p>about what do you pull out, it sounds like on the Google side, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s concern,</p>
<p>both on the advertising and on the consumer products that are being offered, and the scale</p>
<p>and the leverage that Google has, and how they make those products kind of come to market.</p>
<p>And with Facebook, it&rsquo;s really about this absolute kind of monopoly on, you know,</p>
<p>on social products and services, whereas Google&rsquo;s got this great monopoly on search products for</p>
<p>consumers. So you could kind of take a layman&rsquo;s view and say, hey, like rip out WhatsApp and rip</p>
<p>out Instagram, and you know, then Facebook is good. But the problem is, in that infrastructure</p>
<p>layer, they&rsquo;ve created the social graph and this connection between, you know, all the people that</p>
<p>you know, and they&rsquo;ve got all this stuff sitting on the same servers, and Chamath points out all</p>
<p>the same code base, and there&rsquo;s a lot of commonality there. So the reality of like,</p>
<p>ripping something out from there is a lot more nuanced and a lot more challenging than just</p>
<p>saying, hey, you got to get rid of WhatsApp, or you&rsquo;ve got to get rid of Instagram. And it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>likely some sort of Chinese wall situation where you end up with a negotiated exit, continued</p>
<p>ownership and control. But you know, almost like what happened with the banks in the 80s, you kind</p>
<p>of got to separate one side of the business from the other. That could be one way that this goes,</p>
<p>because you know, it&rsquo;s really hard to kind of break apart given the way that these businesses</p>
<p>are built. What do you think about a solution, David, in which they conceded, hey, we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to buy any more of these competing social networks, which I think would be kind of hard for</p>
<p>them to buy one right now. I think that&rsquo;s done. I mean, like, you can even see that Google Fitbit,</p>
<p>I mean, Fitbit is, you know, what is it a 1.2 or $3 billion acquisition, it&rsquo;s going to take almost</p>
<p>two years to close. And Google&rsquo;s already making concessions, antitrust concessions to the EU,</p>
<p>right, or, you know, this is a $1 trillion company trying to buy a $1 billion company. So</p>
<p>I think large acquisition in M&amp;A by the big four, it&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
<p>Is that good for society, Chamath, or bad for society? Is it good for our business of investing</p>
<p>in startups or is it bad for us investing in startups? Well, I think it&rsquo;s good in one very</p>
<p>important way, which is that it forces the capital markets to support these companies. And what I</p>
<p>mean by that is, you know, I&rsquo;ve told you guys a couple times, but in the year 2000, there was</p>
<p>8000 public companies. In the year 2020, July 2020, as we sit there August 2020, there&rsquo;s about</p>
<ol start="4000">
<li>So we&rsquo;ve seen a shrinking of 50% of the number of public companies. So the idea that</li>
</ol>
<p>there isn&rsquo;t an M&amp;A on ramp anymore, means that more capital and the capital markets will become</p>
<p>more fluid. And we will support emerging growth companies in the public markets is my suspicion.</p>
<p>If only there was, yeah, if only there was an easy way for these companies to get public,</p>
<p>David, respond.</p>
<p>Well, I was, I mean, I think that I think you&rsquo;re raising the right issue, which is</p>
<p>the chilling effect on M&amp;A that these hearings are going to have, even if Facebook is never</p>
<p>broken up, or, or that deal is sort of retroactively challenged. The big four tech</p>
<p>companies have to be looking at these hearings. And now they&rsquo;re going to be second guessing</p>
<p>every acquisition they want to make, and it&rsquo;s going to have a chilling effect. And I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a disaster for Silicon Valley. Because we know that most of the startups don&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And, you know, and there&rsquo;s really only, you know, most of them go out of business, and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only two good exits. One is an IPO, the other is M&amp;A. And if you take the M&amp;A exit off</p>
<p>the table, because it&rsquo;s no longer sort of feasible from a regulatory standpoint, not all those</p>
<p>companies are going to IPO.</p>
<p>Yeah, but David, what you&rsquo;re saying doesn&rsquo;t make logical sense, because if those companies are</p>
<p>shit, anyway, they should be going out of business. And who cares about an aqua hire,</p>
<p>or some mini modest hire that gets you two times your money?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of acquisitions, where the acquirer is picking them up because they provide an</p>
<p>important component or technology or product, but that that that startup would not have been</p>
<p>a great standalone public company.</p>
<p>Yeah, would Yammer be worth more today? And would you be worth more money? Would your</p>
<p>investors be worth more money if Yammer had SPAC&rsquo;d? Yes or no, David?</p>
<p>The answer is absolutely yes.</p>
<p>Okay, so David, your argument makes no sense. I think you&rsquo;re playing to lose.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that it doesn&rsquo;t make sense. I think David does bring up something that&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>in the following way, which is there&rsquo;s a lot of companies, Jason, that get to a certain</p>
<p>amount of scale. And then they basically start running out of oxygen, whether it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve overbuilt, or they&rsquo;ve overhired, or they&rsquo;ve overspent, or whatever.</p>
<p>Or there&rsquo;s a natural audience for the product.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe. But I think a lot of it is just sort of more overbuilding and just kind of</p>
<p>distracted capital allocation. But then, you know, you need somebody to come in. And this</p>
<p>is the problem with Silicon Valley. And I think what David speaks to is the following.</p>
<p>If big tech M&amp;A is off the table, the single biggest thing that&rsquo;ll change is valuations</p>
<p>by late stage privates. Because if you know that you can&rsquo;t get a 2x mark to market from</p>
<p>the last post, guess what&rsquo;ll happen to your post money? It&rsquo;ll go way down. Right? Because</p>
<p>that was always the understood assumption. You know, all these guys, these late stage</p>
<p>money can come in and say, well, sure, I&rsquo;ll put, you know, two and a half billion dollar</p>
<p>post a $3 billion post. Because in their mind, what they&rsquo;ve been taught is that immediately</p>
<p>sets the mark to get acquired as 2x. And in many ways, Facebook started it because Facebook</p>
<p>came to buy Instagram, literally weeks after that growth stage round at 500 million. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why they paid a billion one. They doubled the valuation. But wouldn&rsquo;t it? Hold on a second.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be healthier, though, for the entire ecosystem, if we weren&rsquo;t building those</p>
<p>late stage companies to be flipped to a major company, maybe merging them with medium sized</p>
<p>companies are slightly stronger, and then taking them public to your point, Chamath.</p>
<p>The point is, if you don&rsquo;t have a fucked up cap table, you can do all of those things. It&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>fucked up cap table. So this solves that. Who needs this late stage capital coming in and doing</p>
<p>these fakaka crazy rounds? Why not take the company&rsquo;s public earlier?</p>
<p>Well, because look, you don&rsquo;t always know what&rsquo;s going to happen. I mean, this is the reason why</p>
<p>Instagram sold is the reason Yammer sold is you don&rsquo;t know exactly what&rsquo;s going to happen. You</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what the outcome is going to be. And in a lot of those cases that you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>what would become IPOs, if they weren&rsquo;t acquired, well, a lot of them just, you know,</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t going to work. It&rsquo;s crazy to be taking those exits off the table when both the startup</p>
<p>and, you know, the acquirer or the big tech company, you know, want to do the do the transaction.</p>
<p>And one of the reasons why I think these, you know, there are a lot of these M&amp;A type outcomes</p>
<p>is because big companies have realized they&rsquo;re not very good at R&amp;D at sort of good at sort of</p>
<p>new product development. And so what they&rsquo;ve done is they&rsquo;ve outsourced a lot of their R&amp;D</p>
<p>budgets to M&amp;A. And so they let the startups run the experiments, you know, in any category,</p>
<p>in any new area, you end up having a dozen of these startups get funded, you know, we make</p>
<p>fun of it because they&rsquo;re all, you know, there&rsquo;s so many competitors in every little space.</p>
<p>But those startups are the laboratory where all these experiments are taking place. And then,</p>
<p>you know, the big company comes in at the end and sees which experiment did well and they acquire it.</p>
<p>Freeberg, what do you think?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, I mean, I think the advantage of being a platform business is you can</p>
<p>plug something in and immediately gain a lot of scale from it. So, I mean, you know,</p>
<p>Instagram and YouTube are perfect examples. They were, you know, reasonably fast growing,</p>
<p>had millions of users. But once they were plugged into the engine of the bigger platform,</p>
<p>they were worth 100 times as much over a few years, because of all the usage and the</p>
<p>infrastructure and the distribution, etc, that was provided. But, you know, it looked insane</p>
<p>at the time to pay a billion dollars and a billion six for those two businesses. Each of</p>
<p>them are easily worth 100 billion plus today, probably some multiple of that. And so, I think</p>
<p>Sax&rsquo;s point is right. It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;d rather as a&hellip; Look, I worked in M&amp;A at Google for</p>
<p>a couple of years early in my career. I left Google in 2006. And a lot of the infrastructure</p>
<p>that makes Google&rsquo;s revenue engine was acquired. You know, we bought a company called Applied</p>
<p>Semantics for 100 million bucks, or 100 something million dollars at the time,</p>
<p>which ultimately became AdSense. And Applied Semantics could scan a webpage</p>
<p>and basically determine what keywords that webpage represented and then match ads from</p>
<p>AdWords onto that webpage. That acquisition was $100 million. I mean, I don&rsquo;t track anymore how</p>
<p>much but 10s of billions of dollars of revenue are generated by that, you know, by that AdSense</p>
<p>system today. You&rsquo;re bringing up something really important, which is, at the time,</p>
<p>Google was not a trillion dollar company. So, the point is that Google had access to</p>
<p>enough capital market scale, where, you know, nobody&rsquo;s going to get in the way of a 5, 10,</p>
<p>20 billion dollar company trying to buy $100 million business like that. I just don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to see, you know, any regulatory body take that seriously. Wait, so didn&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>just paint the perfect picture? There&rsquo;ll be a trickle down. Wait, isn&rsquo;t that the perfect</p>
<p>picture? I think what it means is the 20 billion dollar company now probabilistically</p>
<p>can actually win. So, for example, like look at this Intuit Credit Karma transaction, right?</p>
<p>The question is, you know, could a smaller company have bought Credit Karma? Probably,</p>
<p>but not at the price that, you know, Intuit is willing to pay. Now, if Intuit gets big enough,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a chilling effect and regulators say, okay, you know, you&rsquo;re above a magic threshold</p>
<p>and, you know, no bueno on the M&amp;A anymore. Now, Credit Karma has two choices, which is maybe they</p>
<p>sell for $4 billion to a very different company, right? Or maybe they sell, actually, let&rsquo;s take a</p>
<p>different example, PayPal. PayPal is now a top 20 business in America, right, by market cap.</p>
<p>So, if PayPal isn&rsquo;t allowed, for example, to buy, you know, a bunch of sort of like,</p>
<p>you know, payment rail, payment companies, maybe what happens is like a, you know, a</p>
<p>medium-tier business is allowed to buy them. And now all of a sudden those medium-tier businesses</p>
<p>can compete with PayPal. That&rsquo;s what I think, that actually seems like the best solution that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve kind of stumbled on here. Can&rsquo;t Slack then become, or Dropbox, or Uber, or any Airbnb? Now,</p>
<p>they can become the acquirers of these companies, and then they can compete. So, why don&rsquo;t we just</p>
<p>say, hey, if you&rsquo;re over a trillion dollars, or if you&rsquo;re over $500 billion, you can buy 1% of</p>
<p>your market cap. I&rsquo;m just throwing a number out here. Jason, let me jump in on this. That&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>what Nadler was arguing for. You know, it&rsquo;s not like Nadler was saying that if you&rsquo;re a big fork</p>
<p>tech company, you can&rsquo;t do these deals, but everyone else can. The standard that Nadler,</p>
<p>and the precedent that he was essentially setting in that hearing is, you know, 20-20 hindsight bias.</p>
<p>You know, if a company acquires&hellip; Yeah, well, putting Nadler aside, I agree with you on that,</p>
<p>but putting that aside, if we were going to come up with a rule, because we know the rules as they</p>
<p>currently exist are inadequate to do any type of regulation for these companies, because none of</p>
<p>them have 95% market share. So, if, in fact, we need a new solution, how about this for a solution?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just putting it out here. You can acquire something that is under 5% of your market cap.</p>
<p>So, if your market cap over the last year is a billion, you can buy something $50 billion or less.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re under $250 billion, you can buy whatever the hell you want.</p>
<p>But J. Kel, let me ask this question. You know, the points we made earlier about YouTube and</p>
<p>Instagram, they were successful because of the scale of the user base of the platforms that</p>
<p>acquired them and the work that had already been done. And so, they could plug in&hellip;</p>
<p>They would have both been totally successful without them.</p>
<p>They would have been successful, but would they have been worth $300 billion like they are today?</p>
<p>Maybe more. Maybe more.</p>
<p>But Instagram was 13 people, YouTube was a couple dozen people. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. The story is a</p>
<p>small group were brought in with an interesting platform that was kind of working at the time,</p>
<p>and then they became these $300 billion platforms. So, that&rsquo;s one scenario.</p>
<p>And a lot of money could be used. And Google and Facebook used a lot of money to be the best</p>
<p>acquirer, to be able to acquire those businesses. And that&rsquo;s the argument for this,</p>
<p>hey, they&rsquo;re at such a scale right now, no one else can compete because only they can pay this</p>
<p>fee. As Chamath points out with Intuit and Credit Karma, only Intuit can buy Credit Karma at that</p>
<p>price. Now, the alternative way to think about this is what if there is vertical expansion?</p>
<p>So, instead of leveraging their existing platform and their existing dominance, what if Google,</p>
<p>in this case, is trying to get into the cloud business? They&rsquo;re competing viciously with</p>
<p>Amazon and Microsoft and others in this enterprise cloud business marketplace that is</p>
<p>continuously evolving, changing every year. There&rsquo;s a different kind of lead and a different</p>
<p>company that&rsquo;s suddenly growing faster than the others. And Google spent $2.6 billion to buy</p>
<p>Looker. Buying Looker for $2.6 billion does not advantage Google&rsquo;s advertisers. It does not</p>
<p>advantage, I mean, to some degree, it might. It does not advantage Google&rsquo;s users. And it is not</p>
<p>about platform dominance in their traditional ad business. It&rsquo;s about vertical expansion into a new</p>
<p>market. Okay. So, here&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;ll rewrite the law, David. If you have over 70% market share</p>
<p>in your vertical, you cannot make additional acquisitions in that vertical. If you have&hellip;</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re buying into a new vertical, right? That&rsquo;s my point.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying. And so, then the caveat is, if you&rsquo;re buying into a new vertical,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to hit that cap.</p>
<p>We already have that. We already have, I mean, that&rsquo;s basically the way the rules work today</p>
<p>is that you look at market share. I mean, Coke cannot buy Pepsi. Facebook cannot buy Twitter</p>
<p>today. But what we&rsquo;re talking about is at a much earlier stage, are you going to interfere</p>
<p>with the M&amp;A? Or are you going to retroactively go back and unwind these transactions?</p>
<p>Unwinding transactions makes no sense. Yeah.</p>
<p>I think the point is, this is all water under the bridge. But the incremental M&amp;A for these</p>
<p>big guys is very unlikely. Now, David does bring up a good point. Unless it&rsquo;s in basically a do</p>
<p>nothing, not that important in the positioning category relative to the core business. And so,</p>
<p>this is why it&rsquo;s, again, go back to like, why did Looker close faster than Fitbit?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s half the price. Looker is twice the price, right? Fitbit is half the price.</p>
<p>Yeah. New market, completely. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. And so, there is a fear that there is going to be a compounding advantage</p>
<p>that regulators have a responsibility to stop. So, I think it goes back to,</p>
<p>once you get to a certain level of scale, the thing that we&rsquo;re missing with online businesses</p>
<p>is this kind of like, there&rsquo;s like a great original sin here that we&rsquo;re not admitting,</p>
<p>which is that the internet is now a pervasive and critical part of human infrastructure.</p>
<p>As such, there needs to be people that regulate and manage the internet, the same way the FAA</p>
<p>manages and regulates planes and wind turbines. Think about the FAA, let&rsquo;s just take aviation.</p>
<p>It is impossible for you to go and just go into your garage, build some random thing to carry</p>
<p>people from point A to point B in the absence of some certification, okay? Take agriculture.</p>
<p>It is impossible for you to basically go and like build up a farm and build up, you know,</p>
<p>livestock or whatever, and all of a sudden just supply it into fucking Sobeys and Safeway without</p>
<p>any sort of like checks and balances. Similarly, and the reason is because it&rsquo;s simple human</p>
<p>infrastructure that everybody relies on. And I just think that we have to admit that now,</p>
<p>the internet company- Also, those are life and death.</p>
<p>This can be too. I mean, like, what about the guy that read the post about like the pedophiles and</p>
<p>the pizza joint came up with an AK-47? Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s quite an edge case compared to flying</p>
<p>on a plane. This stuff is life and death at some level, but even more than life and death,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the anointing of power that then determines life and death.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I think, the key is that it&rsquo;s power. Yeah.</p>
<p>Chamath, do you think that there should be an internet regulatory body that decides how</p>
<p>businesses operate and how content is censored and managed on the internet? Is that what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>kind of suggesting? Yeah, so let me be very specific. So I think that there are very specific</p>
<p>kinds of businesses and business models that should be overseen. Specifically, I think the</p>
<p>first and most important thing is a body that oversees the collection of user data and how</p>
<p>it drives targeting and identification. So privacy concerns around that, that&rsquo;s a no-brainer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first one. And then I think the second one is something that essentially tears the fig</p>
<p>leaf off of internet companies and says, you know what, you are the equivalent of a publisher on a</p>
<p>platform, some weird hybrid that we didn&rsquo;t think could exist when we wrote these rules. And so</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re now going to adapt these rules. Because, you know, if you think about it, nobody is happy</p>
<p>with the internet publishers today. You know, the left thinks that it skews right, the right</p>
<p>thinks it skews left. Everybody&rsquo;s confused. Nobody gets what they want. And so I think somebody has</p>
<p>to step in and kind of sort it all out. Well, I think this is a good segue to</p>
<p>Sax&rsquo;s point. And then I guess we have a fork here now in the discussion. Do we want to go</p>
<p>and talk about censorship and that specific issue across Facebook? Or do we want to get</p>
<p>into Amazon for a second? Which way do we want to go, Sax? Go to censorship. Well,</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, we can talk censorship. Let&rsquo;s jump the fence here. Should there be, to Chamath&rsquo;s</p>
<p>point, Sax, a regulatory body that decides what people can and cannot say on social networks,</p>
<p>yes or no? No, I mean, let&rsquo;s think about that. What we&rsquo;re saying is we need the politicians to</p>
<p>set up a regulatory body to control how the people talk about the politicians. I mean,</p>
<p>that seems like a recipe for disaster. What about specific lies and intentionality to</p>
<p>frame debates incorrectly? Saxie Poole, that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m saying. I&rsquo;m saying like,</p>
<p>you go to a movie, and there&rsquo;s a little blurb here that says who can go to the movie and who</p>
<p>cannot. You buy an album, and it tells you whether there&rsquo;s explicit lyrics or not. Like, before you</p>
<p>turn on the TV, there&rsquo;s like some rating agency that tells you whether your kids should be</p>
<p>watching it with you. My point is, what is the equivalent version? We all need to think about</p>
<p>what it is. But to say that there should be nothing, I think is crazy. Sax?</p>
<p>Well, I think, I mean, those ratings are mostly about, you know, standards related to kids,</p>
<p>you know. And the big internet companies already have a lot of child safety features. I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that you need to create laws around that. And I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re talking about anyway.</p>
<p>I mean, I think the big debate about Facebook or Twitter is whether they&rsquo;re engaging in censorship</p>
<p>or bias, right? And that goes way beyond this topic of child safety.</p>
<p>So, okay, let&rsquo;s unpack.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that they&rsquo;re censoring. All I&rsquo;m saying is, I think you need to label,</p>
<p>and you need to more clearly designate what this content is so that people can choose. Like,</p>
<p>for example, on Twitter, you know, I follow a bunch of people on the right,</p>
<p>I follow a bunch of people on the left, I follow one or two QAnon accounts,</p>
<p>only because like, I just want to see it all. And then I want to judge and I feel like if I can see</p>
<p>everything, I can sort of like lay it all on a table and figure out where the rough center is</p>
<p>and kind of move to that, you know? So you feel you&rsquo;re intelligent and mature enough to do that,</p>
<p>Chamath, but the rest of the world isn&rsquo;t? No, not really. But I try to do it because I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important for me. Would you rather the platforms or some regulators come up with what</p>
<p>you could see on those platforms, Chamath? Again, not what I can see. But there has to be</p>
<p>a simple way, for example, you know, you could have something and again, all this does is it</p>
<p>breaks business models, which then breaks monetization and it breaks the market cap</p>
<p>of these companies. But for example, let&rsquo;s just say you had a new kind of job, which was,</p>
<p>you know, you hired 500,000 people. And these were a combination of lawyers, journalists,</p>
<p>academics, all kinds of random people, artists, everybody, okay? Normal folks,</p>
<p>blue collar folks, and you paid them full time to basically read stuff and kind of like, you know,</p>
<p>wisdom of the crowd style, tell us where this sat in a spectrum. Okay, this is on the left,</p>
<p>this is on the right, this is kind of centered, this seems laughable, this seems unbelievable,</p>
<p>this seems relatively credible. And I think that you would get, you know, very quickly,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think the latency would be that high, but probably minutes, where, you know,</p>
<p>40 or 50,000 signals would tell you whether something is, you know, where something is in</p>
<p>the spectrum of, you know, how to understand it. And then that that system, that system will get</p>
<p>paid, get get played, though, it&rsquo;ll get gamed, right? Like someone will figure out a way to</p>
<p>turn all of Chamath&rsquo;s tweet labels into super evil tweets. And you know, now everyone will</p>
<p>mute you because you&rsquo;re super evil. Yeah, I think we just defined George Orwell&rsquo;s 1984.</p>
<p>Like, or cancel culture, right? If you&rsquo;re paying 500,000 or a million people, if Facebook and</p>
<p>Google and these guys come together on Twitter, and they pay a body of people to do this work.</p>
<p>And so you don&rsquo;t know who posts it, you just see the content, you read it, you label it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a classifier. So Chamath, what do you think you would get classified as?</p>
<p>And then what if you disagreed with what you were classified as?</p>
<p>No, but David, like, what I&rsquo;m saying is, you wouldn&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s me. Like, if I wrote an</p>
<p>article on medium, right, and I wanted to publish it in Twitter, that article first hits a queue,</p>
<p>50,000 people read it, they human classify it. And then it gets published.</p>
<p>And now what if you don&rsquo;t like the way it&rsquo;s classified? And you don&rsquo;t want those tags</p>
<p>attached to it. And you want a place to publish freely without classification without tagging,</p>
<p>then there will be a company that supports that too. And you&rsquo;ll see how much people care about</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think the free market could handle what you&rsquo;re saying, Chamath, because</p>
<p>I think David&rsquo;s concerns would be the same as mine, which is who&rsquo;s doing this classification?</p>
<p>What kind of transparency is there? And we already have the wisdom of the crowds, which is</p>
<p>things that are outrageous automatically get pushed up on Twitter, which allows anonymous.</p>
<p>And then Facebook seems to be all the top trends seem to be on the right.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s swing over to Saks. Saks, what do you think of the 1984 proposal from Chamath,</p>
<p>the 500,000 censors telling you what to think of a post before you read it?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to bias the question, but it&rsquo;s an insane idea, Chamath.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit like Twitter fact checking the politicians they don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the digital Politburo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a form of like soft censorship. And, you know, I actually think that,</p>
<p>you know, Zuckerberg gets attacked the most, but I think his position</p>
<p>on speech actually makes the most sense. I mean, it seems like what he said is</p>
<p>we want to be a neutral free speech platform. And, you know, whereas I think, you know, Twitter and</p>
<p>Snapchat, for that matter, are much more likely to engage in either,</p>
<p>you know, censorship or fact checking.</p>
<p>Which is paradoxical, because Twitter&rsquo;s initial position, David, was it was the free speech</p>
<p>platform.</p>
<p>I totally agree. I think Zuck&rsquo;s position is the most defensible, but it also is the</p>
<p>most untenable because it&rsquo;s the least technologically and socially palatable.</p>
<p>But it is the most defensible and philosophically, in my opinion, the only position you can have.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not going to be what wins.</p>
<p>Right. Well, the reason why Zuckerberg is hated is because if you&rsquo;re going to defend the principle</p>
<p>of free speech, you always end up defending speech that society hates,</p>
<p>you know, like the ACLU and Skokie.</p>
<p>Exactly. Exactly.</p>
<p>And so, you know, Zuckerberg, I think, has done the best job sticking to his guns. I mean,</p>
<p>the reason why Twitter is sort of, you know, loved on the left is precisely because they</p>
<p>gave in to the mob and they&rsquo;ve, you know, they&rsquo;ve started taking down accounts that</p>
<p>the mob doesn&rsquo;t like or, you know, fact checking them.</p>
<p>Whereas I think, you know, and Zuckerberg&rsquo;s refusal to do that, and by the way, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s been like perfect in this regard, but he&rsquo;s been much better about standing up</p>
<p>for the principle of free speech. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s made him, you know, anathema to the left.</p>
<p>I think that and the fact that Facebook still gets blamed for, you know, Hillary&rsquo;s loss.</p>
<p>Freeberg, I have two specific follow-ups to what David just said for you, which is, one,</p>
<p>how much of this has to do with anonymity being allowed on Twitter versus not being</p>
<p>allowed on Facebook. And second, how much of it has to do with the fact that we have</p>
<p>algorithms that trend topics. If we didn&rsquo;t have those algorithms trending them, perhaps</p>
<p>this wouldn&rsquo;t be an issue because if you wrote something that was inflammatory, it wouldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and false, let&rsquo;s say in that situation, both characteristics, it wouldn&rsquo;t go to the top</p>
<p>of the list, which is what everybody&rsquo;s kind of upset about is that something that&rsquo;s false</p>
<p>goes to the top of your feed. Comment on those two issues.</p>
<p>Well, I think your second point&rsquo;s an important one, which is like social media helps to enhance</p>
<p>the stimulation of the amygdala in the human brain. You know, you see something that makes</p>
<p>you angry or something that makes you elated, you are more likely to engage with it. If you</p>
<p>see something that is kind of a rational discussion about something that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>incite emotion in you, you&rsquo;re less likely to engage in it. And so, whatever the engagement</p>
<p>model is, it ends up, you know, creating a lot more virality and chatter, and it kind of gets</p>
<p>brought to the surface. And there&rsquo;s a lot that&rsquo;s been written and said about this that I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;re kind of uniquely in a position to say anything more on. And that&rsquo;s obviously what a lot</p>
<p>of people are kind of concerned about is the inflammatory and polarizing nature of the content</p>
<p>that is getting highlighted on these platforms and is getting greater distribution on these</p>
<p>platforms. And then I think your prior point, I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s about anonymity as much as it is</p>
<p>about any form of censorship that ultimately can be viewed as bias. So, Jim Jordan&rsquo;s points were</p>
<p>actually, you know, as much as the guy rants and goes on and sounds like a guy running on the</p>
<p>soccer field to punch the coach, it&rsquo;s really interesting to hear the point of view that as</p>
<p>a conservative, I believe that a lot of what Donald Trump is saying or what some conservative</p>
<p>voices are saying is reasonable, and that voice should be heard. And to hear over and over about</p>
<p>Twitter pulling these things down, and then seeing a whole bunch of stuff like anarchists</p>
<p>taking over Seattle and taking over Portland, and they don&rsquo;t get their stuff taken down,</p>
<p>you know, them claiming that they can hold down the streets of Portland and Seattle, because that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you know, the way that it should be, doesn&rsquo;t, you know, incite any sort of censorship,</p>
<p>but Donald Trump saying he&rsquo;s going to end it incites censorship. And so I think it&rsquo;s not as</p>
<p>much about anonymity as much as it is about, you know, having censorship tied to a voice and</p>
<p>censorship tied to a labeled or tagged point of view or labeled or tagged individual or voice</p>
<p>on the platform. So without anonymity, I think the problem goes away for Twitter,</p>
<p>I think Twitter is working on a project. And I&rsquo;ve been saying this for a decade,</p>
<p>that they should let everybody pay $50 a year, $5 a month, or 30 bucks a year, $10 a month,</p>
<p>whatever it is to go through a verification process to make sure it&rsquo;s their name on the</p>
<p>account, which by the way, next door is doing at scale, not only do they know it&rsquo;s you,</p>
<p>they know it&rsquo;s your you&rsquo;re the person who lives at that address, because you got a postcard there,</p>
<p>I think, and in Korea, South Korea, you&rsquo;re required to put your social security number</p>
<p>in to open a social account, that would solve the entire problem. Now that may seem and then</p>
<p>it would drive other users who want anonymity to anonymous platforms. And that&rsquo;s where Twitter</p>
<p>is trying to have its cake and eating it too. And they&rsquo;re falling on their face,</p>
<p>they have one level, which is troll accounts, because you can do whatever the hell they want,</p>
<p>playing on a same playing field with people who can, and this is just a disaster for them,</p>
<p>that Jim Jordan may be an idiot, and just a loudmouth. But I think I agree with you,</p>
<p>if the situation was reversed, and we were talking about Obama being censored for some reason,</p>
<p>and the right and right wing people or left wing people being silenced or deprecated on the</p>
<p>platform, you know, soft band, people will be up in arms, but that was a different form,</p>
<p>he should be doing that in a censorship, and they should have a censorship committee talking</p>
<p>about that. What do you think Chamath about these two issues, anonymity on these platforms,</p>
<p>and the velocity in which things that outrage people, because you yourself Chamath, went from,</p>
<p>hold on, but I want to cue this up for you Chamath, you yourself went from being a perennial</p>
<p>guest on a lot of these programs, and then now since you&rsquo;ve been a little bit more vocal about</p>
<p>how you feel about social issues, when you said break everything up, who cares on CNBC,</p>
<p>and then when you said, who cares, let them fail, they don&rsquo;t get their summer hampers house,</p>
<p>you gained 150,000 followers, and now you&rsquo;ve learned that if you&rsquo;re more, I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>say the word outrageous, but if you&rsquo;re more vocal about social issues, you&rsquo;re going to gain a lot of</p>
<p>attention. Do you think you should have been labeled as somebody who is hysterical about</p>
<p>your 500,000 people or being outrageous? Both and all platforms are littered with fake accounts.</p>
<p>The interesting factoid from yesterday was I think Facebook says they take down 6.3 billion fake</p>
<p>accounts or something. Some crazy, crazy, crazy numbers. So they are paying playing whack-a-mole.</p>
<p>Twitter just basically says we don&rsquo;t have the team and the infrastructure. So just let the</p>
<p>6 billion accounts be. That&rsquo;s the only difference between Facebook and Twitter. It&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>acknowledgment of the problem and transparency on the reporting. So, you know, look, my point of</p>
<p>view on this is that I think that irrespective of what I believe about free speech, I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>becoming harder and harder for me just as a layman reading to figure out what&rsquo;s true and not true.</p>
<p>I think that the line is getting very gray and I think that sources that used to have</p>
<p>complete integrity that were, you know, just beyond reproach in terms of their integrity,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not clear anymore because the business model of the internet is driven towards clicks.</p>
<p>So I think what&rsquo;s actually happening is that we are dismantling information and news and</p>
<p>journalism. The first place where I think that goes is places like Substack, which is going to</p>
<p>rebuild it bottoms up, where people will vote with their subscription dollars what to believe and</p>
<p>what not to believe. And then on top of that, people will overlay aggregation tools so that</p>
<p>you can actually have multi-subscriptions and create sort of like next generation</p>
<p>magazines and content subscriptions or whatever. I think that&rsquo;s where the world is going in terms</p>
<p>of information and content. Jason, my honest belief is that I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever said</p>
<p>anything that particularly crazy. I just think that I&rsquo;m reasonably intelligent and I&rsquo;m precise</p>
<p>in what I say and it cuts through a lot of the bullshit because most people have nothing to say.</p>
<p>So, you know, when I make a fucking investment, I write a one pager and I post it and I&rsquo;m willing</p>
<p>to be held accountable. You know, when I don&rsquo;t understand about climate change, I just post about</p>
<p>it even though I want to invest two billion dollars of my own money in it. And so I think</p>
<p>being authentic and just being straightforward is sort of like what is valuable at some level</p>
<p>on the internet. I think that governments are going to regulate these companies. Let&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>be clear. Whatever I think about censorship, it just doesn&rsquo;t matter what I think because</p>
<p>governments are of a belief that these platforms craft and shape public opinion and sentiment,</p>
<p>which drive the aggregation and coalescing of power, which fundamentally disrupts the business</p>
<p>model of the politician. Let&rsquo;s go swing over to Saks here. Saks, any comments on that censorship</p>
<p>issue or the once very respected sources of news maybe being less respected now? I think</p>
<p>the New York Times came to mind when Chamath was sort of outlining that phenomenon. And then we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>move on to Amazon. Yeah, I mean, I think there are things that these platforms can do to elevate</p>
<p>the, you know, the discourse, you know, the quality of the information people are getting.</p>
<p>I think that eliminating the bot accounts, I think it&rsquo;s a huge problem on Twitter that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re out there. They&rsquo;re not really doing much about it. I think that&rsquo;s something they</p>
<p>could improve and fix. You know, requiring people to be who they purport to be, you know,</p>
<p>I think this is tied to the bot issue of, you know, not allowing these sort of sock puppet</p>
<p>accounts. But the thing about those steps that they could take is they&rsquo;re speech neutral, right?</p>
<p>The rules would apply to everybody, you know, to Freeberg&rsquo;s point. And so, I think they should</p>
<p>look at doing more of those things. But, you know, what I&rsquo;m concerned about is that, you know,</p>
<p>so much of the debate, so much of the pressure that&rsquo;s being brought on Facebook is to actually</p>
<p>moderate and control the type of speech that occurs on its platform. And I think the reason</p>
<p>why Zuckerberg is attacked more than say, you know, Jack Dorsey is because he&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>more resistant to doing that. I think it&rsquo;s actually because you have a bunch of what</p>
<p>seems like real names. But again, I think that there&rsquo;s a fake account issue on Facebook that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just as bad as Twitter. It&rsquo;s just the difference is, you know, the fake accounts on Facebook have</p>
<p>proper first and last names, whereas Twitter, you have all kinds of alphanumeric garbage as</p>
<p>an account name. So, here&rsquo;s a different proposal. Why, you know, maybe what we need is the decision</p>
<p>that we allow complete unfettered free speech. And there&rsquo;s a layer of both Facebook and Twitter</p>
<p>and YouTube where that&rsquo;s completely allowed. But the precursor to have that access is you need to</p>
<p>put in your social security number or something that&rsquo;s uniquely identifiable by your government.</p>
<p>So that if you say something, and there&rsquo;s a law against you saying something, already a pre</p>
<p>established law, there&rsquo;s recourse, where can you go and be anonymous tomorrow? Because you know,</p>
<p>on a web page, you can create any web page you want.</p>
<p>No, nobody&rsquo;s gonna say then I think what it creates is a decision by a user to coalesce</p>
<p>on completely different platforms, if what you want is complete anonymity for a very different</p>
<p>reason. And I think that that&rsquo;s very reasonable to my point is, the solution to this David is</p>
<p>diversity, not to have one thing and two companies try to create some Swiss Army knife Frankenstein</p>
<p>product that solves this, it&rsquo;s just not possible. And I think we&rsquo;re both saying the same thing,</p>
<p>which is like, you have completely different behaviors, trying to go in through the same</p>
<p>channel, it&rsquo;s not possible.</p>
<p>Actually, I like the idea of these platforms doing more to eliminate bot accounts and anonymity,</p>
<p>because those are neutral rules of the game. And they do improve the quality of the debate that</p>
<p>occurs on those platforms. I think those would be good things. I think it&rsquo;s just hard to do.</p>
<p>I think that those companies may even want to do that. It seems like Facebook certainly does.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a hard thing to execute.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually not that hard. I mean, if you just said, Hey, listen,</p>
<p>this account in order to have a verified account, you have to have a phone number,</p>
<p>an email. So that&rsquo;s two steps that a spammer trying to create a lot of accounts would not</p>
<p>be able to do because you&rsquo;d have to get burner phone number after burner phone number,</p>
<p>which is a cost. It&rsquo;s possible, right? But it&rsquo;s a cost. And if you want to be verified,</p>
<p>we need your phone number. And we need your email address. And we need you to you put in</p>
<p>your credit card and get charged $1 on your credit card just that over and over and over</p>
<p>overnight Reddit would become the new Twitter overnight Reddit would be cut for Chan would</p>
<p>become the new Facebook. I mean, overnight, like, like, I&rsquo;m not saying to have an account,</p>
<p>Freeberg, but to have the blue checkmark, so you would still be able to and then over time,</p>
<p>people could say, I don&rsquo;t want to see replies unless they&rsquo;ve been verified.</p>
<p>And it could be just a toggle you pick.</p>
<p>By the way, Facebook, Google and Twitter already have this mechanism, because that&rsquo;s what they do</p>
<p>to graduate advertisers up the spending curve. You know, you can start as an anonymous advertiser,</p>
<p>just spending, you know, onesie twosie dollars, you know, just off of a web page, basically,</p>
<p>just you go through and you do self serve ads. And the more you spend, or the more targeting</p>
<p>capability you want, you graduate, you self identify, you give more information, you get</p>
<p>more capability back, you get more trust in the system. So it does exist for the customers of</p>
<p>these big tech companies. And this is the other big thing. What it shows you is that it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>solved the problem for the customers is just doesn&rsquo;t solve it for the, you know, feudalist</p>
<p>feedstock, which are the users, because they won&rsquo;t pay. And so if you said, Hey, listen, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>customers there. They could be those Twitter&rsquo;s coming out with a paid version. So they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>obviously on the on the halfway there, they&rsquo;re going to come up with a paid version of Twitter,</p>
<p>Jack said it on his quarterly earnings. I&rsquo;m going to sell my Twitter stock.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not one of the other free bird, though, you don&rsquo;t have to pick one or</p>
<p>the other, you could still be anonymous, but you have the opportunity because right now they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not accepting new verified users. And unless you&rsquo;re a muckety muck, you don&rsquo;t get to even go</p>
<p>down that route. So shouldn&rsquo;t everybody have? I would like I mean, I person would like Twitter</p>
<p>more if it verified identity. I mean, I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t think there should be a speech tax. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know why they have to charge $1 but but but taking a dollar means we have your credit card. It&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>another hurdle. That&rsquo;s why you can do it like a $1 off without actually charging anyone&rsquo;s card. Yes,</p>
<p>you could do that. For example, like if you if you actually force people to verify by putting</p>
<p>in their social security number, like there&rsquo;s a couple of guys I follow. I&rsquo;ll just name them</p>
<p>Scott Adams, who wrote the Dilbert comments. There&rsquo;s a guy who I&rsquo;m really not sure I understand</p>
<p>his politics, but I follow him because I because you know, he&rsquo;s a rabble rouser.</p>
<p>Is you know, it&rsquo;s not just people on the left, but I think it would be people on the left people</p>
<p>in the center people on the right, who would basically pay the quote unquote tax because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re already real people. And they would just they would then have more guarantees and assurances</p>
<p>that Twitter won&rsquo;t be arbitrary. And I think that makes Twitter better. And if it maybe it</p>
<p>makes it smaller, right? And then maybe you&rsquo;re right, Friedberg, like 4chan or 8chan or Reddit</p>
<p>become good for a different kind of behavior. By the way, I mean, like, that&rsquo;s what we do today.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t eat the same fucking thing every goddamn day. We don&rsquo;t wear the same pants every day.</p>
<p>I agree with where he&rsquo;s going with that. I mean, the the defining feature of Reddit is that it is</p>
<p>basically anonymous. People have usernames, but you never know who it is. pseudonyms. And it</p>
<p>creates a certain kind of conversation. And that&rsquo;s fine. Twitter is supposed to be real people. I</p>
<p>mean, it&rsquo;s not I mean, Facebook, even more so. But, you know, when I think about the accounts</p>
<p>that I follow on Twitter, you know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, you know, all of them are real people. Occasionally,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get, occasionally, you&rsquo;ll get a pseudonymous. Yeah, you&rsquo;ll get like a startup L.</p>
<p>Jackson or something like that. And, you know, and I think that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you would choose to then follow them.</p>
<p>The difference with like a startup L. Jackson is they&rsquo;re not a fake account. They&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>using a pseudonym. Right. And you know that when you follow them.</p>
<p>And over time, they&rsquo;ve proven to be to provide some value that makes people follow them.</p>
<p>And so you can be anonymous if you get a certain number of followers.</p>
<p>I guess you rise above the noise. Here&rsquo;s another solution. There are no, there&rsquo;s no nuance about</p>
<p>truth or how much you believe this is true as a voting mechanism. So if you were verified on</p>
<p>Twitter, and there was a scale that says how true, how truthful do you believe this is,</p>
<p>and you could slide it and pick, you know, from one to five, you could actually have another</p>
<p>signal there. What do you think about some sort of a signal to Chamath&rsquo;s point about community</p>
<p>values saying, I buy this, I don&rsquo;t. 97% of people wouldn&rsquo;t use it. And the 3%</p>
<p>that do would completely bias the result. Okay, Chamath, what do you think would happen?</p>
<p>I agree with Freeberg. I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s just, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>good idea. My only comment was just offering the other thing, by the way, I know it sounds crazy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just offering it as like the, you know, the way that this negotiated solution will end up.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of sort of what these internet companies are being forced to do, which are these</p>
<p>weird, you know, pseudo action bodies that like review things and like, you know,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s all just a slippery slope to that outcome. But by the way, you were speaking</p>
<p>about StartupBellJackson, you know, there was another guy, SuperMugatu. And, you know,</p>
<p>he turned out to be this, you know, really good, young, up and coming investor, Dan McMurtry.</p>
<p>And he was sued, you know, he used a pseudonym for a long time, build up a huge audience,</p>
<p>and then flipped himself and basically came out and said, here, my name is Dan McMurtry,</p>
<p>and I run a fund. And, you know, it was wonderful. Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s a very good marketing strategy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a growth strategy now, be StartupBellJackson, and then you wind up becoming a venture partner.</p>
<p>When are you going to announce that you&rsquo;re the guy behind VC Brex?</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m not ready to do that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not ready. People thought it was me. I was like, I&rsquo;m getting tortured.</p>
<p>Wait till you hear that I&rsquo;m the guy behind Zero Hedge. That&rsquo;ll really freak you out.</p>
<p>Well, Zero Hedge is instructive. Didn&rsquo;t he get banned? Or did she get banned for</p>
<p>posting about stuff in coronavirus that eventually turned out to be acceptable and true?</p>
<p>Now imagine if he had verified his account, he had a social security number, he had all that</p>
<p>stuff in there, just verified, that&rsquo;s it, just information that says Zero Hedge is real. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a real person. Yeah. And you know, the rule is when you&rsquo;re that level of verified,</p>
<p>you can publish whatever you want.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can, you can say false statements as a real person. So Donald Trump is a real person,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a verified account, and he&rsquo;s saying things that Twitter is then determining are false,</p>
<p>or inflammatory.</p>
<p>I would rather, you know, them not try to do it. And I&rsquo;d rather have pundits that you can</p>
<p>believe in. So the other problem is like, look, when you have public figures, you have punditry</p>
<p>around public figures. But the problem isn&rsquo;t what that person says, it&rsquo;s you can&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>the punditry, because half of them are fake. So at some point, you have to break the cycle,</p>
<p>and somebody has to be real.</p>
<p>Well, and this is the problem with the Trump issue in a pandemic is two edge cases put together.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re figuring out what the actual cost of it is. Trump said masks are bullshit,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to wear a mask, blah, blah, blah, I choose not to wear a mask,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to give people the satisfaction of seeing me in a mask. Turns out masks are correct.</p>
<p>We, we should have put that, or should we have put in front of Trump&rsquo;s non-mask comments, hey,</p>
<p>this is against what the guidelines are. Or the fact is the WHO said the World Health Organization</p>
<p>said you shouldn&rsquo;t wear masks. Then it turns out now we have a bunch of conservatives dying</p>
<p>who didn&rsquo;t wear masks. No, I don&rsquo;t think I don&rsquo;t think you should have put anything there.</p>
<p>And let all the conservatives who believe him die.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about letting conservatives die. I think that&rsquo;s a crazy way of positioning it. Like,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s allowed to have his opinion. And really, like, if anything, I think social media</p>
<p>has shown that the way that we use to venerate, like veneration is sort of like, it&rsquo;s kind of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been disrupted by social media. Like the idea that you venerate somebody because like,</p>
<p>they won an election in a moment is so crazy, because they are basically like you,</p>
<p>and in many cases, maybe dumber than you.</p>
<p>With respect to all these ideas surrounding the idea that we need to</p>
<p>regulate these platforms. I think we should just remember that the way stuff gets into your feed</p>
<p>is that you make the decision to follow it. You know, these feeds are self curated. I mean,</p>
<p>there is this issue about, well, you know, the algorithm does sort of emphasize or sort of</p>
<p>increase the volume. And, you know, we want to make sure those algorithms,</p>
<p>you know, are done in a neutral way. They&rsquo;re not, they&rsquo;re not biased somehow. But,</p>
<p>you know, the content that appears in people&rsquo;s feed is content they&rsquo;ve chosen to see</p>
<p>with the exception of trending topics on both platforms.</p>
<p>Well, like I said, though, as long as those algorithms are unbiased and work in a speech</p>
<p>neutral way, I think they&rsquo;re fine. But the, you know, the reason why Facebook has been boycotted</p>
<p>is that they refuse to censor some of Donald Trump&rsquo;s tweets, you know. But you don&rsquo;t see those</p>
<p>posts, rather, unless you&rsquo;ve chosen to follow them.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s crazy that they want to ban him.</p>
<p>Problem is, it&rsquo;s a chain of it&rsquo;s a chain of fake accounts and real accounts, right? Let&rsquo;s be honest,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a combination of both that exists on both Facebook and Twitter, to amplify content in ways</p>
<p>that none of us really understand. And I would I would be very skeptical that anybody there</p>
<p>really understands every single piece of content, how and why it gets weighted the way it does. And,</p>
<p>you know, like, well, I bet you that there&rsquo;s probably a way to tell whether an account is fake.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously, they have system integrity tools to figure this out. That&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way you could have eliminated 6 billion accounts if that wasn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>But then, you know, you choose not to suppress the weighting of those, or maybe you do suppress</p>
<p>the weighting of them entirely. It&rsquo;s just an all you&rsquo;re talking about. But in terms of</p>
<p>implication, okay, so maybe maybe you can game the trending topics that way, but you can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>in my feed, unless either I choose to follow you or you pay to, you know, run an ad, which my eyes</p>
<p>are just trained to skip over. So I, you know, I think if you were to ask the average person,</p>
<p>do you believe that you are sort of influenced by deceptive content on Twitter and Facebook,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re sort of unduly influenced? They would say no, you know, none of us believe that we are</p>
<p>but then if you asked, but if you if you said, do you interact in groups and forums</p>
<p>with a bunch of people that you don&rsquo;t know? The answer would be 100% Yes,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m saying is that the average person doesn&rsquo;t believe that they&rsquo;re unduly influenced. But But if</p>
<p>you ask them, or do you think other people are they would say, David, of course, like, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you know, when you&rsquo;re having a fucking slurpee, it&rsquo;s like, you know, do you think that this is</p>
<p>unduly gonna hurt you? No. It&rsquo;s 1200 calories of liquid sugar.</p>
<p>All right, I think we beat this horse to death. There&rsquo;s no solution, just on the edges. But let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go to Amazon, because I thought that this was a particularly interesting one. Amazon,</p>
<p>I thought came out the best of everybody, and is the least likely to be broken up. I think some of</p>
<p>you agree with that. What were your impressions on Amazon&rsquo;s performance and Amazon in terms of</p>
<p>being broken up? Let&rsquo;s start with you, Friedberg. And then we&rsquo;ll go back to Chamath.</p>
<p>I think the intention of antitrust laws, obviously, is to protect consumers and protect markets and</p>
<p>protect market pricing from being manipulated by monopolists or monopolies. And so, you know,</p>
<p>the point that was made about Walmart years ago is the same point that&rsquo;s being made about Amazon</p>
<p>today, which is that they&rsquo;re crushing small local businesses. And as a result, there is a lot of</p>
<p>damage being done. And they are quote, unquote, too powerful. But the reality is that the pricing</p>
<p>effect of what they&rsquo;re doing is what needs to ultimately be scrutinized. And I think is what</p>
<p>will ultimately drive whether or not these guys have either some massive penalty or get forced</p>
<p>to break up. And so you ask yourself the question, look, if I&rsquo;m going to buy, call it a mattress,</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s use something like a pillow. Is it cheaper for me to buy that pillow as a consumer</p>
<p>through Amazon or from the local store? Now, what if the local store is put out of business because</p>
<p>of Amazon, and now Amazon is the only place I can get a pillow? Is the pillow now going to be more</p>
<p>expensive or less expensive than it would have been otherwise? And I think that is the lens by</p>
<p>which we need to kind of assess and the regulators will ultimately assess whether or not Amazon is</p>
<p>causing harm in the marketplace because of its position and its power.</p>
<p>Freebird.</p>
<p>Look, I have several businesses that sell on Amazon. And it is fucking expensive. One of my</p>
<p>companies I&rsquo;m on the board of, we&rsquo;ve been the number one food product on Amazon multiple times.</p>
<p>We kind of slide up and down the top 10.</p>
<p>Can you say what that is?</p>
<p>Yeah, Soylent. Soylent. And so we sell a lot of Soylent on Amazon. And it is expensive, man. I</p>
<p>mean, the fulfillment, the shipping, the advertising fees they force you to pay. I will</p>
<p>tell you that as a business owner or board member of a business that sells and I have several others</p>
<p>that sell on Amazon, too. It is a grind. And it is cheaper for us to sell directly through Shopify.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you just raise the price on Amazon?</p>
<p>So to some extent, so Amazon, this is actually part of the problem. So Amazon forces certain</p>
<p>best pricing negotiations. If you&rsquo;re a large seller on Amazon, you have to make sure in order</p>
<p>for them to promote you and make you kind of a sponsored item and show you at the top of the list,</p>
<p>you have to give them the best deal, sort of like what Walmart does, right? You can&rsquo;t have a cheaper</p>
<p>price anywhere else.</p>
<p>Got it. So that was something that did not come up. They force you to have the best price there,</p>
<p>even if you charge more on your website.</p>
<p>In these negotiated deals. Yeah. And so you have to make sure that you&rsquo;re providing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure what the deal is specifically with Soylent. So I don&rsquo;t want to kind of speak</p>
<p>incorrectly here.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;ve heard the same thing from other folks.</p>
<p>That is kind of part of what happens. And so I will tell you like it is harder for it is</p>
<p>cheaper for me to sell Soylent. I think it&rsquo;s cheaper for some of these products to be sold.</p>
<p>I can tell you my other company, which we sell quinoa, it&rsquo;s cheaper for us to sell</p>
<p>through retail stores than it is to sell on Amazon. We actually give up more margin selling</p>
<p>on Amazon.</p>
<p>Then why would you do it?</p>
<p>Because of the volume and because they&rsquo;ve aggregated all the consumers.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve made the decision as an entrepreneur to sell you quinoa in all places,</p>
<p>even though you lose some margin, you make it back in aggregate.</p>
<p>Well, this goes to the market.</p>
<p>Sounds like capitalism to me.</p>
<p>Well, this goes to the market problem, because now I have less choice as a business owner,</p>
<p>because the only place I can find consumers is in this online marketplace called Amazon.</p>
<p>I can no longer go sell at 50 local grocery stores because people don&rsquo;t go to the freaking</p>
<p>local grocery stores anymore. And that&rsquo;s obviously a little bit of an extreme statement. But let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say I&rsquo;m a pillow guy. I can&rsquo;t go sell at 50 pillow stores because they&rsquo;ve all been shut</p>
<p>down because all the consumers go to Amazon.</p>
<p>But could you also sell at Target and Walmart and those other competitors who seem to be doing just,</p>
<p>you know, pretty well, actually?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing well. Yeah. And a lot of people have said that they&rsquo;re the kind of,</p>
<p>you know, the exceptions, but there&rsquo;s a thousand versions of Sears and other</p>
<p>stores that haven&rsquo;t done as well. Walmart and Target just happen to be extremely well</p>
<p>run businesses. But there&rsquo;s nothing fundamental about those businesses.</p>
<p>What if Amazon kicked you off the platform and said, we&rsquo;re not going to allow third party</p>
<p>sellers? Would you be happier or would you be sadder?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d be sadder.</p>
<p>Got it. Chamath, what are your thoughts?</p>
<p>Amazon specific.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think David said it really well up front,</p>
<p>which is that it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s kind of a when and not an ifs. So it&rsquo;s, you know, Amazon today,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think is at risk just because its end market is so big. But I think within five or 10</p>
<p>years, it definitely will be looked at through the same lens as Facebook and Google. And</p>
<p>actually just those two. Look, and I think David said it also really well,</p>
<p>like the antitrust law that you would get, you know, to be successful if applied to Facebook</p>
<p>and Google has nothing to do with users and content. And it has everything to do with</p>
<p>the pricing of the ads to their customers. And if anybody actually were smart enough</p>
<p>to figure out whether there was some way in which their auctions were working,</p>
<p>that was effectively pricing inventory in a market, quote unquote, or in a system manipulated</p>
<p>way, that&rsquo;s probably the best hook to nab one of these folks in antitrust law. But other than that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be regulation. In terms of Amazon, I think they&rsquo;re going to get away unscathed.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s incredible, by the way, is, you know, two days later, they&rsquo;re like, hey, by the way,</p>
<p>we just got an FCC license and we&rsquo;re going to launch a $10 billion satellite constellation.</p>
<p>And, you know, if you if you looked at their RFP to the FCC, the number of people that,</p>
<p>you know, basically complained and cried, it was incredible.</p>
<p>By the way, I think this is a huge, important point that we haven&rsquo;t made,</p>
<p>which is the benefit of scale for large innovative companies. There is no way any</p>
<p>company would have out of the blue been able to afford a $10 billion distributed satellite</p>
<p>program without having customers and all this other stuff lined up. Amazon can afford to take</p>
<p>that risk, just like Alphabet has taken the risk with self driving cars and did so before anyone</p>
<p>else for many years, which is a net benefit for society, correct? Which is a net benefit for</p>
<p>society. So by having scale by having incredible profits by and then by reinvesting it in R&amp;D,</p>
<p>creating jobs innovating, it&rsquo;s the only way this kind of stuff is going to get done.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to get it done by breaking up these companies and having 100 companies that</p>
<p>only have $10 million of profit each. And then each of them are, you know, no one at all can</p>
<p>afford to do these grand, important projects that move markets forward.</p>
<p>Ultimately, for humanity, Freeberg, you see these trillion dollar plus companies</p>
<p>as because they can make those big swings, a net benefit for humanity.</p>
<p>As a technologist, and as a kind of person that hopes for the future,</p>
<p>I hope that these sorts of companies can continue to persist, and that they&rsquo;re led by people that</p>
<p>want to take innovative risks with R&amp;D dollars. And by the way, if they don&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>fucking fail eventually, right? It&rsquo;s these guys that are leading these companies and putting these</p>
<p>crazy bets on crazy new ideas that are allowing these businesses to remain competitive. And if</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t, and you know, some big company manager were to come in and start running these</p>
<p>things and distributing cash and dividends back to shareholders, these wouldn&rsquo;t be happening.</p>
<p>And you know, capitalism would take care of itself. And then the next big innovative risk</p>
<p>taker that can generate a profit and reinvest that profit in a smart way would end up winning</p>
<p>in the marketplace. So&hellip;</p>
<p>Saks, you are a big investor in SpaceX at Kraft Ventures, I understand.</p>
<p>And when you see Bezos copy every single thing Elon does from, you know, launching the rockets</p>
<p>to then putting up the satellites, do you think he&rsquo;s just a copycat?</p>
<p>Well, you know, I think he&rsquo;s the scariest monopolist out of the whole bunch. You know,</p>
<p>if you look at kind of Amazon versus, say, Google or Facebook or Apple, I mean,</p>
<p>those other companies are sort of sticking to their original footprint, whereas Amazon keeps</p>
<p>expanding into new areas. You know, it&rsquo;s that whole mantra he has about your profit is my</p>
<p>opportunity. And so, yeah, with each, you know, with each advancement they make as they get into,</p>
<p>you know, as they get to a new level of scale, they then turn around and seek to take over</p>
<p>kind of the, you know, the areas that their vendors or business partners are operating.</p>
<p>And so, you know, it started with first they did retail, you know, books, and then they expanded</p>
<p>to other areas of retail, and then they take over infrastructure, and now there&rsquo;s talk about them</p>
<p>getting into freight or trucking. And so, yeah, they keep expanding into these new areas. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really a statement about our politics. I agree with Jamal that Bezos went pretty much unscathed,</p>
<p>and I think it has a lot to do with, you know, he did win the internet with that opening statement</p>
<p>that he gave. It was a really sort of great, you know, rags to riches, only in America type story.</p>
<p>And so, I think, I agree with Jamal, he&rsquo;s going to get away pretty unscathed, but I do think that</p>
<p>they are the scariest monopolists of the bunch. Well, comment specifically on him copying every</p>
<p>one of Elon Musk&rsquo;s ideas. Well, you know, copying is, it is sort of a part of the game, you know,</p>
<p>it is part of the game. And I&rsquo;ve heard you attack Zuckerberg for doing the same thing.</p>
<p>And, you know, look, I get it, you know, we prize innovation, and we love innovators.</p>
<p>But as soon as you say that you can&rsquo;t, that other companies can&rsquo;t copy those innovations,</p>
<p>you do stifle progress. Yeah, but I look at it as more, how consistently do you do that as your</p>
<p>playbook? When you look at Amazon Basics, this is the point I wanted to make when I made in my</p>
<p>earlier podcast, which was, you know, the Amazon Basics and the third party seller system is the</p>
<p>thing that they keyed in on these hearings, they did not key in on the issue of that Freeberg</p>
<p>brought up, which was what is the margin they&rsquo;re taking from those third party sellers, which I</p>
<p>think would have been a much more deft approach to questioning them. But when it comes to third</p>
<p>party sellers, the fact is, they&rsquo;re allowing people to compete with them on their own platform,</p>
<p>which drives prices so low. And when they make a better USB-C cable, that doesn&rsquo;t take a genius</p>
<p>to make a better cable. So do you think Amazon Basics should be allowed and is great for humanity?</p>
<p>Or do you think that that using of the data, because they have the sales data on it,</p>
<p>is in some way abhorrent and a problem given the way antitrust laws are currently framed?</p>
<p>Well, okay, so I think this is an area where, so the area you&rsquo;re talking about is the way that</p>
<p>these platforms treat the applications or small businesses that operate on their platforms. And</p>
<p>I do think this is a good area for Congress to keep scrutinizing. There&rsquo;s a saying in chess that</p>
<p>the threat is greater than the execution. So sort of a chess strategy principle. I think that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>here where we, I think the execution would be a disaster if we actually impose a lot of these</p>
<p>rules. If we broke up these companies, if we stopped Amazon from innovating, I think that</p>
<p>would be a disaster for those companies and for the economy, because I do think they do a lot of</p>
<p>good things. But in a weird way, I think we have to keep threatening to do those things in order</p>
<p>to get these companies not to do anti-competitive things. I mean, we heard Bezos say that he</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t guarantee that they weren&rsquo;t using their seller&rsquo;s data in inappropriate ways, basically</p>
<p>to break Amazon&rsquo;s own policy. And so I think you do have to apply this kind of scrutiny to</p>
<p>these companies, because I don&rsquo;t think we want to be retroactively, you know, remediating a</p>
<p>situation. I don&rsquo;t think we want to be breaking them up or doing something like that, but I do</p>
<p>think we want them second-guessing these anti-competitive decisions before they actually happen.</p>
<p>Because otherwise, you know, they ‚Äî</p>
<p>So some scrutiny, some rules, but we certainly don&rsquo;t want to ankle them versus their competitors</p>
<p>in China. As we wrap up here, because we&rsquo;re getting way past our hour, we&rsquo;re now at 80</p>
<p>minutes, and we said a max of 90 here was what we all agreed on. I want to talk about the election.</p>
<p>We are now at the 100-day mark. We all thought Biden was a shoo-in. Now I have my own thesis.</p>
<p>I want to float it and see what you guys think. You had Trump start wearing a mask last week,</p>
<p>telling everybody they should wear masks. Now there&rsquo;s universal discussion of wearing masks.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a little bit of vaccine hope, and we&rsquo;ll get to Friedberg&rsquo;s position on,</p>
<p>is that vaccine false gold, or is it actual reality? But we know that masks are going to</p>
<p>take three or four weeks, if they&rsquo;re implemented properly, for us to see the caseload go down,</p>
<p>which then ‚Äî the caseload starts going down, and three or four weeks after that,</p>
<p>the deaths would start going down. We may have even seen a little plateau in the number of cases.</p>
<p>Cases is ramping up. We hit a record 850,000 or 900,000 just yesterday at the time of taping,</p>
<p>I think on the 29th of July. Now, my thesis is, Trump goes all in on masks.</p>
<p>The vaccine starts to show promise right as the debates start. He gets in there with Biden.</p>
<p>We see caseloads go down. We see deaths plummet. We get down under 250 deaths per day in America.</p>
<p>By September 15th, the market rips, and on the end of September, we have the first presidential</p>
<p>debate. Biden dunks on a senile, or maybe not crisp, Biden. Trump sails in. And we were just</p>
<p>talking two months ago, anything could happen, but Trump was definitely not going to be there.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go around the horn. Friedberg, vaccine false gold, or really promising? And what happens</p>
<p>in the election? I think there&rsquo;s tons of promise with vaccine news in the next two months,</p>
<p>three months. I guess the point is, you&rsquo;re going to hear more upside than you&rsquo;re going to hear</p>
<p>downside news on vaccines, for sure. You know, whether or not we have a vaccine, and by when,</p>
<p>and yada, yada. Percentage chance we have a vaccine. We&rsquo;re going to have a vaccine. I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a function of how many doses, at what point in time. And, you know, there is this 30,000 trial</p>
<p>happening with Moderna right now. There&rsquo;s a Russian vaccine that just got approved yesterday in Russia</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re saying is ready to go, and they&rsquo;re starting to distribute it. So there are vaccines,</p>
<p>right? This is a known known. So that news will only continue to improve and build, and there&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>only be more and more indications of success with vaccines between now and November. How that</p>
<p>affects markets, I think, I&rsquo;m not sure that drives markets as much as some of the other stuff that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on in markets with the Fed and with policy and with stimulus packages. I think those are</p>
<p>frankly important drivers right now. And how much the markets ultimately affect the election,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. So yeah, it&rsquo;s all still pretty uncertain. Who&rsquo;s going to win?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s pretty uncertain. Okay, you have to put your entire net worth on one person go.</p>
<p>Yeah, I still think Trump is, I kind of have been vacillating on this. I think Trump is probably</p>
<p>only going to improve from here on out. So your entire net worth is on the line in three,</p>
<p>two, place your bet. I&rsquo;d go Trump. Wow. Wow. It&rsquo;s still it&rsquo;s still it&rsquo;s still to me. I mean,</p>
<p>Trump is got to be the huge underdog here. I mean, right now it looks like Biden&rsquo;s gonna win. I mean,</p>
<p>his basement strategy could backfire in the sense that if you know, fundamental conditions improve</p>
<p>with respect to COVID or the economy, the fact that he hasn&rsquo;t said anything done anything gone</p>
<p>anywhere. You know, it could it could turn out to be a mistake. But right now, it it looks like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s working. And, and, you know, Trump seems to be completely knocked off his game. You know,</p>
<p>just earlier in the week, he floated this trial balloon about delaying the election that was</p>
<p>completely shot down by Republicans. And it&rsquo;s when you saw that, what did you think as a Republican</p>
<p>when you saw him tweet that? What did you think? What was your emotional visceral reaction as our</p>
<p>token? You know, I&rsquo;m not, I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t necessarily identify with with partisan politics.</p>
<p>So let me just I have to state that. But what was your reaction as an American to him saying delay</p>
<p>the election? Of course, everybody, everybody shot down for your reaction. Everybody shot it</p>
<p>down for good reason. Everybody your reaction, of course, of course, we&rsquo;re not going to delay</p>
<p>the election. We&rsquo;ve, you know, you know, we haven&rsquo;t delayed the we didn&rsquo;t delay the election</p>
<p>to fight. He&rsquo;s so scared of being pinned as a Republican. He&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not gonna fuck with your</p>
<p>deal flow sacks. You could be a Republican. Okay, your entire net worth, we have to wrap</p>
<p>your entire net worth sacks. You could right now 3-2 net right now looks like Biden&rsquo;s gonna win.</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s been knocked off his game. And let me just say, like, I think the problem that Trump</p>
<p>has right now is he&rsquo;s a salesman without a sales pitch. You know, you go back to the state of the</p>
<p>union pre COVID. He had it all worked out. He was gonna run on the greatest economy ever keep</p>
<p>America great. That issue has been taken away from him. And it seems like he&rsquo;s still trying</p>
<p>to regain his footing. He&rsquo;s trying to figure out what to run on. And the fact that he can&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>these rallies, which were really, you know, the fact that he was able to go in 2016 to the swing</p>
<p>states, he would be, you know, flying around on his plane. And you&rsquo;d three he did three rallies</p>
<p>a day in these swing states with 10s of 1000s of people wanted it he wanted to win. It was it was</p>
<p>that and it gave him a way to go over the heads of the media and speak directly to the people.</p>
<p>And then those people talk to other people, there&rsquo;s a lot of word of mouth. And so he hit the</p>
<p>inability for him to hold those rallies, I think has just been devastating for the type of campaigning</p>
<p>that he likes to do. And so in a weird way, we have less than 100 days to the election,</p>
<p>but it feels like the campaign hasn&rsquo;t really started yet, because Trump can&rsquo;t do rallies,</p>
<p>and Biden hasn&rsquo;t left his basement. Okay,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure math, entire net worth on the line, all SPACs, SPAC, B, SPAC, C, SPAC, D, whatever you</p>
<p>got spacked up, all your SPACs on the line, everything the Warriors position, three to</p>
<p>two, but we don&rsquo;t need to guess, but I&rsquo;ll tell you why. You know, we had a 33% drop in GDP,</p>
<p>we have double digit unemployment. And I think Trump&rsquo;s real path to winning the White House,</p>
<p>which we talked about before, was getting an enormous stimulus bill passed, and he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>force the Republican Senate to the table to make sure that these unemployment benefits didn&rsquo;t roll</p>
<p>off. Now, there&rsquo;s a very practical problem with these unemployment benefits, which is that it is</p>
<p>not administered at the federal level. It&rsquo;s administered by literally 50 state agencies that</p>
<p>run relatively decrepit software. Now, just so you guys know, why did we pick $600? It was</p>
<p>an estimated numerical average, because what the Republicans really wanted to do was just top it</p>
<p>up. You know, whatever you used to get to get 200. And it was technically not feasible to implement</p>
<p>across 50 different insurance. Somebody in Boise, Idaho is different than somebody in New York.</p>
<p>So they were like, ah, $600. So my point is, it&rsquo;s going to take four to eight weeks</p>
<p>to re-implement unemployment insurance once we decide what we&rsquo;re going to do. So that basically,</p>
<p>if you started today, puts you somewhere between September 1 and October 1. And so you have then</p>
<p>30 days to basically catch a positive tailwind or 60 days, so call it midpoint 45 days. You know,</p>
<p>you have now federal eviction laws that are rolling off. So I think that it&rsquo;s setting itself</p>
<p>up for a very difficult path. He just stopped spending, I believe in Michigan, Trump did,</p>
<p>which is, you know, not a good sign. He actually has overspent in Georgia.</p>
<p>So if you look at the facts on the ground, your entire net worth goes on.</p>
<p>Now, Biden, it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a languishing campaign. As of today, David is right. He&rsquo;s a salesman</p>
<p>without a pitch. And unfortunately, he&rsquo;s a the path isn&rsquo;t clear. The path should have been</p>
<p>paved with money. It&rsquo;s such a no brainer. Here, let me let me give you one last call that money</p>
<p>to and why would you stop printing the money? If you gave everybody $1,200 and six weeks of</p>
<p>unemployment, why not just do it for another six weeks and give everybody another 1200?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why that&rsquo;s such a difficult decision for Trump,</p>
<p>free bird. No, let me give you a scary poll that just came out by you. It says</p>
<p>55% of supporters of Donald Trump say that they will not accept the election victory of Joe Biden</p>
<p>if mail in votes are allowed. Wow. So the framing of this is actually a little bit more serious than</p>
<p>just who&rsquo;s going to win. There is a further polarization constitutional crisis question</p>
<p>rioting, you know, whatever disregard for the election entirely kind of moment coming up here</p>
<p>because Trump and others have kind of framed this as such a non election election because it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>fake and it&rsquo;s all fake news. And, you know, this is all part of the conspiracy. So there is</p>
<p>something scary brewing, I think. And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m kind of most interested in tracking</p>
<p>is really where does this all go? Percentage chance that we get to a constitutional crisis.</p>
<p>And Trump says, I&rsquo;m not leaving the White House on a percentage basis, free bird.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll say I&rsquo;m not leaving the White House. I think he&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>fucking happy to go back to wherever he&rsquo;s gonna go. Yeah, but I think it&rsquo;s I think there&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be other ramifications that are worth us figuring out and thinking about because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the scary stuff that&rsquo;s coming next. Okay, that&rsquo;s a 25% chance of a constitutional crisis. I think</p>
<p>if the election is close, we could easily have like a Gore v. Bush type situation. It could be</p>
<p>very damaging for the Republic. I do not think there will be a hanging</p>
<p>chat issue in this election. This is going to be one way or the other incredibly decisive on</p>
<p>an electoral college. Okay, final, I don&rsquo;t not set up for it to be that that close.</p>
<p>Okay, well, I don&rsquo;t think the election right now is not trying to be close at all. It&rsquo;s trying to</p>
<p>be a blowout. And so I think we&rsquo;ll avoid the crisis because it&rsquo;s not close. And it looks like</p>
<p>Biden&rsquo;s gonna run away with it. But if it does get super close, you know, I could imagine there being</p>
<p>a crisis based on people not accepting that if the margin of error is within the margin of these</p>
<p>mail-in ballots, and you have, you know, 30-40% of the population saying they&rsquo;re not going to accept</p>
<p>it. I&rsquo;m not saying we&rsquo;ll have like a legal crisis, but I think you could have a legitimacy crisis,</p>
<p>it can be very bad for the Republic. Not as bad as Trump&rsquo;s presidency, clearly.</p>
<p>So, final question, final, final question. If Trump believes he&rsquo;s not going to win,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s essentially given up right now, which it feels like he&rsquo;s kind of given up.</p>
<p>What would do you think who would win if Trump says Nikki Haley and Pence can run? I&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>such an amazing job. I&rsquo;ve been the best president in the history of the union. But I want to get</p>
<p>back to my life. And I think Pence, Nikki Haley should go for it. What happens and who wins?</p>
<p>Saxe. Too late for that? Too late for that. You can&rsquo;t you can&rsquo;t put Pence and Nikki Haley</p>
<p>on the ballot. Why not? Of course you can, if he says I&rsquo;m feeling under it.</p>
<p>If he bows out, the Republicans would have to pick a successor. It&rsquo;s not a new third party,</p>
<p>the Republicans would be allowed to pick a successor. If he said I&rsquo;m not doing it for,</p>
<p>you know, health reasons, whatever the reason he comes up with,</p>
<p>who wins? Nikki Haley? No? Too silly? This is silly. I think he might drop out. I think</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m putting it out there. I think it&rsquo;s a 5% chance he doesn&rsquo;t want to be demolished.</p>
<p>And he says, you know what, I&rsquo;ll take the deal. You agreed to not prosecute me getting out of</p>
<p>here. I&rsquo;ll take it and I changed I changed my bet to Joe Biden. I&rsquo;ve changed my bet.</p>
<p>After this, after you read your whole network, you change to Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Well, he&rsquo;s clearly the favor right now. And the question is whether there&rsquo;s still time for</p>
<p>there to be a change. I mean, honestly, I think we should stop betting on what the outcome is. I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s stupid. I think what we should really be worried about is what are we doing? Like</p>
<p>letting tens of millions of Americans roll off of unemployment insurance with zero like the</p>
<p>Republican Senate went on vacation. It&rsquo;s ridiculous. I mean, they should all be fired.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the craziest thing. We have the biggest crisis in our lifetime. If you roll up the</p>
<p>last three crises, 9-11 dotcom bust and the Great Recession, those three pal in comparison</p>
<p>to the magnitude of this one. And these motherfuckers are going on vacation. I agree</p>
<p>with you. It&rsquo;s outrageous. I don&rsquo;t think partisan politics are that interesting. But</p>
<p>I think they will eventually pass a bill. I think the the issue on the unemployment is not that the</p>
<p>Republicans don&rsquo;t support an extension of unemployment. But the the magnitude of the</p>
<p>unemployment now exceeds what workers would get if they went back to work. And so I think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re concerned about creating a disincentive for the difference. Why not make it $300?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s honestly it is such fake fucking news. Like it&rsquo;s like it has been shown that people</p>
<p>then end up spending that money. Like I don&rsquo;t know if you guys saw but like there are industries</p>
<p>that are posting it&rsquo;s not just Facebook, Amazon and Google posting meat and beets like you wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>believe in boating in housing people are spending this money it drives GDP. So whether you put 600</p>
<p>or 200 or 1200 into people&rsquo;s pockets, they have a proclivity to spend it they should have gotten</p>
<p>something done. Trump Trump as well as all the Republicans are up for reelection, I think we</p>
<p>just cave on this issue. And I think it will get done. The Republicans are opposing it are the</p>
<p>ones who aren&rsquo;t up for reelection and are concerned about debt. You know, that&rsquo;s the that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the concern that all the debt matter if we go into a depression, David, why not?</p>
<p>The incremental six weeks of unemployment, put it at $300. But get something done, David.</p>
<p>Why are you not getting something done, David? Why is your team fucking this up,</p>
<p>David? Yeah, I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t wear a jersey. I&rsquo;m not on a team.</p>
<p>But I think they will get something done. I mean, I&rsquo;m not when they&rsquo;re back for vacation. Do you</p>
<p>think they should have gone on vacation? They&rsquo;re got their own vacation, David. They can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They got to come back to work. These guys went duck hunting instead of</p>
<p>taking care of the 15 million your team went hunting Washington DC.</p>
<p>Because obviously, there&rsquo;s a lot of there&rsquo;s enough Republicans who want to get something</p>
<p>done. I mean, why not blame the Democrats for being too intransigent?</p>
<p>Sorry, what I&rsquo;m saying is it&rsquo;s not Republican. I&rsquo;m saying the entire</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re breaking your chops, sex, the entire group should not have gone on vacation.</p>
<p>The entire half half half of the Congress is gone.</p>
<p>Where are they? What? What are they doing? That&rsquo;s more important.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re hanging out in their basement like like Biden.</p>
<p>I love you guys. All right. Everybody stay safe. On behalf of the dictator himself,</p>
<p>best DC, the the SPAC Meister himself. Stay safe, Chamath. On behalf of the queen of quinoa,</p>
<p>the Friedberger himself. Stay safe, David Friedberg,</p>
<p>in whichever one of your three houses you&rsquo;re in right now. And.</p>
<p>And to rain, man, he&rsquo;s definitely burnt. Don&rsquo;t burn, baby. He&rsquo;s definitely a great</p>
<p>driver in the driveway. Yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He&rsquo;s definitely a lot of</p>
<p>Wapner Wapner. And of course, fish sticks. And of course, he&rsquo;s still investing from craft,</p>
<p>certainly craft funds still investing. We&rsquo;ll see you all next time on the six most popular</p>
<p>podcast out of the gate. Let&rsquo;s see. Maybe if you tell your friends about this podcast,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll go to number one on the technology list.</p>
<p>Love you, boys. Stay safe. Can&rsquo;t wait to play poker. Bye. Great job, everybody.</p>
