<p>work and I was always around 350 375 but</p>
<p>then we sold all of our stuff and I</p>
<p>moved to the city here and I got a you</p>
<p>know a sedimentary job just walking kind</p>
<p>of talking you know I&rsquo;m a supervisor</p>
<p>right so what happened just slowly it</p>
<p>kind of came on because I wasn&rsquo;t doing</p>
<p>any physical work and then slowly and</p>
<p>slowly in you know I tried a few things</p>
<p>along the way but it just never stopped</p>
<p>and I always been told by doctors I got</p>
<p>one of the slowest metabolism I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>when I eat a little bit of food it stays</p>
<p>with me so I&rsquo;ve always had an issue with</p>
<p>that but it wasn&rsquo;t pretty good shape but</p>
<p>just being sedimentary for I moved up to</p>
<p>2005 and it just slowly kept coming and</p>
<p>coming and before you know it you&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>big you&rsquo;re like well tomorrow I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>start something tomorrow I&rsquo;m gonna do</p>
<p>some and then you don&rsquo;t realize that no</p>
<p>one said you&rsquo;re like whoa this is</p>
<p>getting out of control here so it just</p>
<p>basically crept on over the years and I</p>
<p>hear you what what at your peak what did</p>
<p>you end up weighing well I think I was</p>
<p>like probably around six hundred and</p>
<p>something around probably six ten but</p>
<p>then I did a little bit you know and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lost if you here know 1020 but I</p>
<p>could never really get on because I was</p>
<p>doing it kind of backwards so I would</p>
<p>like you know get like a hamburger rinse</p>
<p>all the fat off you know how rice you</p>
<p>know everything that was backwards or he</p>
<p>never really worked you know as we</p>
<p>talked about insulin is probably just</p>
<p>spiking up I thought I was doing it</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>but I never was so you probably never</p>
<p>even heard of the word keto at the time</p>
<p>no well the only reason I heard a keto</p>
<p>is that I watched like you have seen I</p>
<p>was watching Joe Rogan</p>
<p>and he was talking about it and I you</p>
<p>know the way he was talking about I was</p>
<p>like oh this is kind of interesting it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of up my alley so I heard about it</p>
<p>probably a month before my birthday you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s beginning in September and I</p>
<p>started doing a little bit of research</p>
<p>on it and then I just decided on October</p>
<p>6 was my birthday two years ago I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna start doing it and so that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>I did but I just did a little bit of</p>
<p>research you know read Jamie Moore&rsquo;s</p>
<p>book you know found you I found a couple</p>
<p>other people Leon Stephanie she&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little a little crazy for me that&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>hardcore for me but I basically just you</p>
<p>know got on and started at my own</p>
<p>research and reading a few books and on</p>
<p>October 6 the day I started I started</p>
<p>the keto and that day I hired actually a</p>
<p>personal trainer we have a table they</p>
<p>come into your house</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s called Fitness on the go so I</p>
<p>started on the trainer five days a week</p>
<p>and I started in Quito that day and that</p>
<p>was two years ago now so and so so uh do</p>
<p>you remember that day what did you weigh</p>
<p>yourself you remember the exact dose 587</p>
<p>587 pounds yeah I know it was the</p>
<p>picture how tall are you 511 how does</p>
<p>that feel - on your joints I mean I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t even imagine them as special but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s them that&rsquo;s the funny part I was</p>
<p>a pretty mobile big guy like I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have no joint problem the only problem</p>
<p>that I was really having that was</p>
<p>scaring me was I had a bit of water</p>
<p>attention to my lower legs so that was</p>
<p>in the other problem with sleeping like</p>
<p>I would sleep sitting up a lot of time</p>
<p>to call it the Buddha just sit on the</p>
<p>edge of my bed I could fall asleep</p>
<p>though I was pretty big I wasn&rsquo;t a tax</p>
<p>and those shirts I&rsquo;m showing you so I</p>
<p>was in a tax I&rsquo;m down to an extra-large</p>
<p>to maybe a 2x offensive shirt it is now</p>
<p>cuz right you right now I think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>200 it was a a Jew 64 to 64 yeah why I</p>
<p>still I my goal was when I started this</p>
<p>I wanted to get down to 250 I missed it</p>
<p>by 14 pounds I&rsquo;m getting to the lower</p>
<p>end here and it&rsquo;s getting a little</p>
<p>tougher than it was you know in the</p>
<p>beginning so Wow okay so did you find</p>
<p>that the weight came off pretty rapidly</p>
<p>in the beginning oh yeah I did like it</p>
<p>was really weird like when I first</p>
<p>started Aikido you know I just you know</p>
<p>increased the fast everything they said</p>
<p>and like</p>
<p>in the first probably two weeks I</p>
<p>probably lost 35 40 pounds like it 11</p>
<p>was water weight I know it was watery</p>
<p>then after that it was consistently</p>
<p>losing between 7 to 10 pounds a week Wow</p>
<p>Wow at the at that time did you also</p>
<p>include intermittent fasting</p>
<p>no I didn&rsquo;t starting to rain fasting</p>
<p>until May this year I started May 1st so</p>
<p>what it basically did and I started I</p>
<p>was doing three meals a day I would do</p>
<p>breakfast lunch and dinner and I we I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>have a little bit of snack with us</p>
<p>hungry the beginning but wait was coming</p>
<p>off and then basically I got into about</p>
<p>8 months later I was kind of stolen a</p>
<p>little bit I was a little confused</p>
<p>because I was taking like MCT oil I was</p>
<p>adding avocado oil the food you know way</p>
<p>too much bad so I actually contacted</p>
<p>Tristan you probably know him and I got</p>
<p>a little you know I wanted a little</p>
<p>advice that wasn&rsquo;t in the books and</p>
<p>basically told me to get back to simple</p>
<p>cut out some of the fats but once I did</p>
<p>that and really dropped against right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically start eating basic more</p>
<p>basic foods again and just got in not</p>
<p>not adding any fat just you know cooking</p>
<p>the hamburger</p>
<p>you know adding the kale and you know</p>
<p>that kind of stuff just simple quite and</p>
<p>then I started you know missing the</p>
<p>breakfast so I started you know going to</p>
<p>11 o&rsquo;clock until you know 6 o&rsquo;clock and</p>
<p>then I went two o&rsquo;clock until 6 o&rsquo;clock</p>
<p>and I did that until me first</p>
<p>Wow and then they come in stalled out</p>
<p>again a little bit so on May 1st I said</p>
<p>well I&rsquo;m gonna do the 23 and one so</p>
<p>basically I don&rsquo;t eat till like 7:00</p>
<p>8:00 o&rsquo;clock at night and I just have</p>
<p>one meal a day and I&rsquo;ve been doing that</p>
<p>every day since May 1st and so tell me</p>
<p>about your hunger I don&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>hunger I never really did that was the</p>
<p>funny thing and I&rsquo;ve never felt better I</p>
<p>you know even a month into when I</p>
<p>started keto like even when I was 587 I</p>
<p>was sleeping</p>
<p>normal I I was never that hungry like it</p>
<p>really turned like some for me it was I</p>
<p>was never hungry before I did have</p>
<p>cravings they you know perchance a piece</p>
<p>or something like that it went away with</p>
<p>me really quick Wow</p>
<p>so makes it easier so when you were</p>
<p>losing like let&rsquo;s say seven pounds a</p>
<p>week how long did that last before I was</p>
<p>like six pounds and five pounds and four</p>
<p>pounds per week they started to soul</p>
<p>around 424 that&rsquo;s when I started to</p>
<p>introducing a little bit intermittent</p>
<p>fasting and I started cutting down a</p>
<p>little bit of meals before I would have</p>
<p>like a breakfast you know you know five</p>
<p>piece of bacon eggs and omelette and</p>
<p>then I would have like a Caesar salad</p>
<p>with some chicken for lunch because I</p>
<p>was kind of on the go and then at night</p>
<p>I would have you know say you know like</p>
<p>a hammer or whatever kind of like</p>
<p>regular meals and then that was going</p>
<p>good and I was working out every day too</p>
<p>and I would do you know I had a trainer</p>
<p>for an hour a day and I would only do</p>
<p>maybe 15 minutes cardio but I was doing</p>
<p>weights trying to get body movement get</p>
<p>some strength back and I was doing that</p>
<p>every day when I got down in the 400s I</p>
<p>started adding in cardio half an hour a</p>
<p>day and then just introducing more in</p>
<p>this same with the weights five days a</p>
<p>week so I was always working out but the</p>
<p>problem was gone for 24 I started to</p>
<p>stall out a little bit like I was</p>
<p>getting down to one or two pounds a week</p>
<p>and but I was always introducing too</p>
<p>much fat my problem was there I had way</p>
<p>keno setting avocado Altis like you know</p>
<p>say my hamburger my kale I was adding I</p>
<p>just have an MC tol every morning that</p>
<p>the shots you know so I just basically</p>
<p>started cutting all that out I just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t wear I&rsquo;m CTO no more adding any</p>
<p>oil I would just have the fact that was</p>
<p>in the hamburger you know with the kale</p>
<p>like I I kinda have a pretty simple</p>
<p>routine now but cuz I&rsquo;m only doing one</p>
<p>meal a day but I just cut out all the</p>
<p>extra fat because everybody&rsquo;s like we</p>
<p>all kind of know you don&rsquo;t eat that I</p>
<p>try to have it on me so I need to stay</p>
<p>in there and I&rsquo;ve never really had</p>
<p>elevated ketones like everyone always</p>
<p>talks about I&rsquo;ve only had between point</p>
<p>six and one like that&rsquo;s where I kind of</p>
<p>like test my blood and then my blood</p>
<p>Sugar&rsquo;s always stayed around three</p>
<p>point-two</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a really low blood sugar the</p>
<p>whole time and I basically stay there</p>
<p>and never really goes up and I feel</p>
<p>really good now that that belong the way</p>
<p>night I test my you know i prick my</p>
<p>finger I don&rsquo;t do as much anymore</p>
<p>because I know how I feel</p>
<p>now um when you were in high school did</p>
<p>you have any weight issues oh yeah I was</p>
<p>big my whole life I grew up on a farm</p>
<p>right so I&rsquo;m glad I worked every morning</p>
<p>before school every day after heere up</p>
<p>on a dairy feedlot I was strong like I</p>
<p>was big I I worked hard every day I</p>
<p>never he&rsquo;s most 350 375</p>
<p>did your privates ever wait</p>
<p>um little not really little bit not too</p>
<p>much</p>
<p>how about your brothers and sisters my</p>
<p>brother and sister are yes we got that</p>
<p>bad body type you know whatever the one</p>
<p>is that you know we store fat very well</p>
<p>did you as kids like eat a lot of sugar</p>
<p>no it was just all meat potatoes Oh like</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t have a lot of that kind of</p>
<p>stuff darkness yeah just like you know</p>
<p>the regular farm to do you know like</p>
<p>lots of meat monster Tainos yeah so so</p>
<p>so all of you were kind of big growing</p>
<p>up yeah and these still are baby I&rsquo;m the</p>
<p>one that&rsquo;s the smallest and so and so so</p>
<p>I think I think you said in high school</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like three hundred and something</p>
<p>pounds 350 375 Wow and just with citizen</p>
<p>Terry lifestyle you just like shut up</p>
<p>like 405 soon as they quit farming I we</p>
<p>I moved to the city here and I got in</p>
<p>said Mary job I just went slowly just</p>
<p>kept going on every year nothing and I</p>
<p>would kind of lose ten fifteen work out</p>
<p>hard within like you know get working</p>
<p>more and then you don&rsquo;t work out enough</p>
<p>like if I&rsquo;m not doing a good bit of</p>
<p>stuff it just crept on and like it came</p>
<p>back fast Wow and that was the problem</p>
<p>yeah Wow and then when you hit when you</p>
<p>were actually in the 500s did you have</p>
<p>any other health issues like the doctors</p>
<p>say your cholesterol is high or anything</p>
<p>like that or diabetes yeah they said</p>
<p>like you know a little you know my blood</p>
<p>pressure behind my you know my class</p>
<p>drawl is how they put me on like this</p>
<p>dad and they put me on you know Robert</p>
<p>Brown like a small dose you know I went</p>
<p>to see a diabetes clinic a couple times</p>
<p>but every time I tested I was always</p>
<p>never quite a diabetic he&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>really really heavy but you never</p>
<p>because I never did really have sugar</p>
<p>I was never sugared I never had candy I</p>
<p>never really liked sugar before I was</p>
<p>come over pizza and chips the sandwich</p>
<p>kind of guy so I was never a huge ended</p>
<p>that but it was always kind of on the</p>
<p>verge of it but my biggest problem I was</p>
<p>having water retention legs my lower</p>
<p>legs and that was what scare me and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>retiring in a few years they came when</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 50 and the problem was I was like</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;ve done very well I&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>this problem with my you know water</p>
<p>tension my legs my sleeping well am I</p>
<p>going return fighters any to get</p>
<p>something in order but all the other</p>
<p>stuff we&rsquo;ve tried in the past</p>
<p>seemed to work until you know I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>basically so Joe Rogan talking about</p>
<p>ideas they Raven on and I didn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>dog because I&rsquo;ve tried Atkins in the</p>
<p>past but never work because they never</p>
<p>had a plan and then what you get into</p>
<p>Quito and you just stay with it the food</p>
<p>is so easy like it&rsquo;s so enjoyable like I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know like I would never even go</p>
<p>back to eat regular because there&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>much good stuff you can have right yeah</p>
<p>the other thing now is I&rsquo;m doing the</p>
<p>intermittent fasting is to me even once</p>
<p>a day is probably the easiest thing I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>ever done I feel the best and I have</p>
<p>like so my meal is I&rsquo;m pretty consistent</p>
<p>I need like I only eat at 7:00 at night</p>
<p>so I have like four pieces of Swiss</p>
<p>cheese with some cream cheese and some</p>
<p>bacon but that&rsquo;s my appetizer then I</p>
<p>have the regular size kale salad I eat a</p>
<p>kale sell and I have my own olive oil</p>
<p>and spices I put on and then I mix some</p>
<p>once a week I have organic the hamburger</p>
<p>and I do one pound of kale one pound of</p>
<p>spinach and I just put spices in and I</p>
<p>just basically comes out to be two and a</p>
<p>half cups and that&rsquo;s my meal I have five</p>
<p>days a week and then on the weekends all</p>
<p>how like eggs or bacon</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;ll maybe switch it up a</p>
<p>little bit but five days a week I have</p>
<p>the same food you know I have like a</p>
<p>salad a hot meal and then like just a</p>
<p>little appetizer</p>
<p>Wow and that&rsquo;s all I eat and I work out</p>
<p>right now I&rsquo;m doing 45 minutes of pretty</p>
<p>hard cardio and I&rsquo;m doing our weights</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m getting lots of games like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>strength</p>
<p>you know sighs and I don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>what the protein is but it&rsquo;s not that</p>
<p>much like people are saying oh he</p>
<p>appeals protein I don&rsquo;t have any extra</p>
<p>fat to it and a lot of times they call</p>
<p>travel I guess went on for the weekend</p>
<p>it was their Thanksgiving and I&rsquo;ll work</p>
<p>all that day I&rsquo;ll Drive home I&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>forget T I won&rsquo;t even eat til the next</p>
<p>night I can go two days and I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>totally unbalanced like and I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>worked out like I worked out the day</p>
<p>before and I worked out fasted and then</p>
<p>I just eat the next day and I&rsquo;m fine I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t ice guys say what I mean I can</p>
<p>feel it I&rsquo;m a little bit hungry and I</p>
<p>would like something but yeah it goes</p>
<p>pretty easy now</p>
<p>Wow have you noticed like with your skin</p>
<p>loose skin oh I have an issue I might</p>
<p>apply surgery like I&rsquo;m big okay there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like probably 500 operations I got to do</p>
<p>the upside down tea first and then you</p>
<p>know the exciting you have skin I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna have a skin issue I do have a skin</p>
<p>mmm-hmm how about your cognitive</p>
<p>function are you noticing like any</p>
<p>difference with that like before versus</p>
<p>now oh yeah the brain lick you probably</p>
<p>started after a month I was a lot more</p>
<p>sharp before oh you know you&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>tired you can never sleep your brains</p>
<p>always race he&rsquo;s always thinking about a</p>
<p>million things now you go to bed</p>
<p>I remember my dreams like I just go to</p>
<p>bed and then I wake up on time like like</p>
<p>is this the way like after a month I</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t believe how better I was</p>
<p>sleeping that was the one thing I</p>
<p>noticed right away in the cognitive</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not so foggy anymore</p>
<p>right and then what about your fluid now</p>
<p>do you still retain or is that better no</p>
<p>I got Danes in my legs and like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>super I got pretty Superman I was like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s for a big guy still got the skinny</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like you know my legs and that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re right down there&rsquo;s nothing there</p>
<p>I only get my arms and all that like my</p>
<p>face I never had the problem in my neck</p>
<p>you should probably see in the picture I</p>
<p>had a pretty big you know I had no neck</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s all coming back I just have it</p>
<p>run my midsection I was really big I was</p>
<p>made x rate so I was if you look at the</p>
<p>picture there in that door I took up two</p>
<p>of those doors and then I only have one</p>
<p>if you look at some pictures yeah I went</p>
<p>from an 8x</p>
<p>down to basics an extra-large why are</p>
<p>you so like to lose 40 more pounds I</p>
<p>would like to get you to 25 right now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s getting a little slower I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>half a pound a week do you know maybe</p>
<p>0.25 pounds and something cells do 1.5</p>
<p>just depends it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s kind of bit of a</p>
<p>little bit of a slower but I know I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>getting smaller and size because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gaining more muscle and the clothes are</p>
<p>going down sorry just that the weight</p>
<p>side so I&rsquo;m not really too concerned but</p>
<p>I would like to probably get down</p>
<p>another 25 to 40 I don&rsquo;t know if I can</p>
<p>get there with my body type you know</p>
<p>yeah I think you know even though it may</p>
<p>feel like wow it&rsquo;s just really slowing</p>
<p>down you could be at your maximum weight</p>
<p>loss which is because you&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>retaining muscle you&rsquo;re growing muscle</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re losing weight it could come out</p>
<p>to about the same because here because</p>
<p>all we have to do is like measure weight</p>
<p>but so as long as you&rsquo;re shrinking</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like a good indicator that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>working big time working and in my</p>
<p>muscle</p>
<p>like my legs are getting you know way</p>
<p>stronger you can see the muscle</p>
<p>definition you know your arms everything</p>
<p>is getting you know shoulders chest it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>okay now but I do have the excess skin</p>
<p>which is you know a problem people are</p>
<p>as big as me and lose that what are the</p>
<p>other things that I&rsquo;ve also done since</p>
<p>the beginning I also take like my</p>
<p>vitamin store though I&rsquo;m doing the</p>
<p>internet fasting I always took them in</p>
<p>the morning and I&rsquo;ve always been doing</p>
<p>like I do amazing grass the wheatgrass</p>
<p>and I do they&rsquo;re super grass and they</p>
<p>take my vitamins in the morning and I do</p>
<p>four shots of their organic lemon and</p>
<p>four shots apple cider vinegar I do that</p>
<p>on my empty stomach it&rsquo;s never raised my</p>
<p>blood sugar nothing so I don&rsquo;t eat til</p>
<p>7:00 8:00 at night but in the morning I</p>
<p>have my vitamins and my wheatgrass and</p>
<p>my super grass because we can&rsquo;t find</p>
<p>your stuff up in Canada your target</p>
<p>across the border the charges a lot of</p>
<p>money I know I know so I can only get</p>
<p>that something it&rsquo;s organic and I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>taken that since the beginning cuz you</p>
<p>know when you&rsquo;re doing this kind of dye</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not getting them a lot of greens</p>
<p>like I do have my salad today but I do</p>
<p>take that extra and I take quite a</p>
<p>regiment of vitamins to just to you know</p>
<p>keep going on it to make sure everything</p>
<p>is there that I need and I&rsquo;ve never had</p>
<p>an issue with anything you know so but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done that since day one and so I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>always doing you&rsquo;re out the cider</p>
<p>vinegar and I&rsquo;ve always done the poor</p>
<p>shot so that I do that every morning I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do it three times a day so awesome</p>
<p>Wow and how was your sleep oh it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>perfect like as soon as I go to bed I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>asleep in that wake up I&rsquo;m gonna use</p>
<p>alarm clock like I need sleep money you</p>
<p>know eight nine hours whatever you know</p>
<p>when I go to bed I&rsquo;m up at 7 the sleep</p>
<p>was probably been the biggest one you</p>
<p>know that was a huge problem before like</p>
<p>I was you know saying when you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>paying of course and then the breathing</p>
<p>and but it might be this thing is I tell</p>
<p>people I&rsquo;ve done in two years</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve stayed steady on it for two</p>
<p>years I&rsquo;ve never had an extra meal or</p>
<p>you know gone off and like oh it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>there I&rsquo;ve always tried to get better</p>
<p>and better better when you first start</p>
<p>it takes a couple months you know in</p>
<p>three meals a day to get your body over</p>
<p>because that was really big I probably</p>
<p>had insulin resistance like they said</p>
<p>but it took a while to get over and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just you slowly get at it but you got to</p>
<p>keep moving</p>
<p>like everyone&rsquo;s like really scared what</p>
<p>exercise but I&rsquo;ve done it since day one</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t get stronger you</p>
<p>probably get a Pedro my buddy Mike the</p>
<p>secret is probably just moving</p>
<p>everything and it was hard getting I</p>
<p>could barely do two things you know and</p>
<p>then it just gets you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>saving money day after day after day</p>
<p>after day and then what you try to do is</p>
<p>just try to get better at what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing go down smaller do I really need</p>
<p>that extra you know a little bit of food</p>
<p>no you don&rsquo;t and you know you can still</p>
<p>gain muscle on it everyone&rsquo;s that Gloria</p>
<p>I have all this protein and all that I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t and I&rsquo;ve been doing this since May</p>
<p>first I do you know one meal a day and I</p>
<p>probably had the best gains and my</p>
<p>cardio is higher than it&rsquo;s ever been</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m going increasing on my cardio</p>
<p>like I think the bike and rower I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>getting faster and I&rsquo;m going more</p>
<p>yardage and stuff so I don&rsquo;t know about</p>
<p>like having to have all this protein the</p>
<p>game also like everybody says you can</p>
<p>gain quite a bit of muscle a good good</p>
<p>shake it just hasn&rsquo;t one meal a day</p>
<p>totally on the flip side I had a client</p>
<p>who is quite large you know and they</p>
<p>were supposedly doing in a minute</p>
<p>fasting but really what happened right</p>
<p>around five o&rsquo;clock they would start the</p>
<p>carbs in the grains and the rice and the</p>
<p>sugar and they would graze all the way</p>
<p>until 12:00 midnight and then they</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t eat for the next part of the day</p>
<p>but they gained so much weight and fluid</p>
<p>retention from the carb it&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>ya know I like that&rsquo;s one thing I only</p>
<p>have like I only probably eat like</p>
<p>probably 20 minutes because I start my</p>
<p>meal and they say 7 o&rsquo;clock I have so I</p>
<p>do my meal so that I have my hot meal I</p>
<p>do five of them for the week I already</p>
<p>have my kale salad those square one and</p>
<p>then I already other so what I do is I</p>
<p>have my four piece of cheese with the</p>
<p>cream cheese and a little bit of bacon</p>
<p>bits on and then I have the salad and</p>
<p>then I have my hot meal at the end and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably done in 20 minutes half</p>
<p>hour and that&rsquo;s all I hate Wow you know</p>
<p>and I do that every day and I you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s after I&rsquo;m working out and after</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known myself I do that later at</p>
<p>night because that time I&rsquo;m feeling good</p>
<p>you know a couple hours I&rsquo;m going to bed</p>
<p>and then I started gaming and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably the best thing I go in on</p>
<p>holidays for two weeks posture and I was</p>
<p>kind of down to two meals a day I was</p>
<p>going to a full inclusive resort for two</p>
<p>weeks</p>
<p>13 pounds at that you know you know so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been losing weight even when I</p>
<p>travel I go you know forward</p>
<p>I travel away you know I just go to a</p>
<p>restaurant or a hamburger you know with</p>
<p>the avocado slice cheese bacon get the</p>
<p>Caesar salad no croutons or you just go</p>
<p>off bacon and eggs they get so easy to</p>
<p>eat out or if you&rsquo;re like can&rsquo;t find</p>
<p>that just go to a deli get some white</p>
<p>some of those they own the process</p>
<p>salami meats like you know but I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never had an issue I have that so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many meals you can get up</p>
<p>there get a few pieces of cheese and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re fine to go like there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>excuse that you can&rsquo;t you keep you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>stay home to prepare it you can go buy a</p>
<p>salad and you don&rsquo;t get a limit of olive</p>
<p>oils for spices and throw it on it you</p>
<p>know he could have read in the container</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s always a way to have keto no</p>
<p>matter where you are even at the airport</p>
<p>there is there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s stuff you can</p>
<p>buy yeah you just have to be creative</p>
<p>huh you know in the airport of course I</p>
<p>go okay so I&rsquo;ll be doing a 12-hour</p>
<p>flight I&rsquo;m gonna buy some nuts or</p>
<p>something and you know yeah I&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>gotten in snacking one thing that</p>
<p>probably it&rsquo;s been really good with me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never tried to snack I would just</p>
<p>have my meals now is it</p>
<p>I never even have anything in my house</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t how good nuts</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even smart that I actually ate</p>
<p>those nuts as a meal because that the</p>
<p>food and the plane was just all carbs so</p>
<p>yeah one thing I&rsquo;ve done though that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably gonna make you crazy I do drink</p>
<p>guy cop and I&rsquo;ve done it since the</p>
<p>beginning one of my secrets is when I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing the intimate fasting I&rsquo;ll have a</p>
<p>couple like dr. peppers and night I try</p>
<p>to go with the aww because no caffeine</p>
<p>in it but I do drink that and I&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>had a blood sugar spike and I&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>had an issue I know you always say don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do it I do that on my fast and I&rsquo;m still</p>
<p>you know I was losing on the fast thing</p>
<p>I was doing like say sometimes ten</p>
<p>pounds we cleared first started from</p>
<p>when I was a little heavier now I&rsquo;m get</p>
<p>down there in size but I don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>much I have left to lose like I&rsquo;m still</p>
<p>losing but I don&rsquo;t really mind that you</p>
<p>know yeah yes if you&rsquo;re consistently</p>
<p>shrinking you&rsquo;re feeling better you know</p>
<p>sometimes the diet sodas won&rsquo;t affect</p>
<p>the weight necessarily but I have had</p>
<p>several patients that end up with blood</p>
<p>disorders and other issues so and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve done it just for a long period</p>
<p>of time so like I drink the water too</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll make a big pot of tea you know</p>
<p>essence the TVM lemon - and I have that</p>
<p>in my</p>
<p>because go more natural but what I find</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m feeling a little bit hungry and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m anemic faster I think I&rsquo;m hungry</p>
<p>I just go have something drink and then</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fine and long as I&rsquo;m keeping myself</p>
<p>busy during the day it&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sitting around sometimes is when you</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re hungry but you&rsquo;re not they</p>
<p>just go do something you know and</p>
<p>everything you need the energy to work</p>
<p>out well I can work out it you know I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>at the end of my FAFSA exam I usually</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t work out till 6 o&rsquo;clock at night</p>
<p>cuz I haven&rsquo;t working during the day so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing my workout in near the end of</p>
<p>the fast and I&rsquo;m still feeling fine and</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have anything you know I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>feel too tired at the end of the day so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just being consistent I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like save the money you have to do it</p>
<p>day after day I don&rsquo;t call new six days</p>
<p>a week</p>
<p>I do weights five days a week even when</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tired now if the weight unit I just</p>
<p>do it once I&rsquo;m down I&rsquo;m down I&rsquo;m happy</p>
<p>yeah and then you have people that say</p>
<p>oh I can&rsquo;t afford to do the eating plan</p>
<p>well let&rsquo;s see you&rsquo;re only doing one</p>
<p>meal a day I think you can afford that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saving so much money</p>
<p>hey I&rsquo;ll tell you like my most expensive</p>
<p>thing is lately I buy the organic</p>
<p>hamburger but if you learned the money</p>
<p>just buy the regular hamburger which is</p>
<p>cheap and I lose two pounds for a week</p>
<p>so I get two pounds of hamburger I like</p>
<p>an candidates 500 grams for a bank</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll buy the frozen chopped kale because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easier to get so much more because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve bought real kale frozen but by the</p>
<p>time I&rsquo;ve done there it cost me a</p>
<p>fortune it&rsquo;s way cheaper to buy the</p>
<p>frozen kale and I have frozen spinach I</p>
<p>mix that in with two pounds of hamburger</p>
<p>and I had a bunch of spices like Cajun</p>
<p>tex-mex</p>
<p>and I use hot sauce and I put some</p>
<p>shredded cheese in there and I just</p>
<p>divide how it works out to five meals at</p>
<p>two and a half cups and then the salads</p>
<p>up here three bucks a day for a kale</p>
<p>salad and the cheese and that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>basically maybe 15 bucks at the end of</p>
<p>the week the bacons most expensive now</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll think of it like how much protein</p>
<p>when you eat in that meal</p>
<p>well I have been how many ounces</p>
<p>probably four tablespoons of bacon bits</p>
<p>Hormel that&rsquo;s what I used I have four</p>
<p>piece of Swiss cheese a little bit of</p>
<p>cream cheese on there and then I have</p>
<p>basically I divide that two pounds of</p>
<p>hamburger to five meals so that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having so I need to give two enough</p>
<p>cups of hamburger and kale and cheese</p>
<p>mix that&rsquo;s all anything it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>not a lot of proteins and yep you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>apparently doing good and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually you have you had a lot of</p>
<p>reserved</p>
<p>use up so you&rsquo;re gonna have to create</p>
<p>that you know that vacuum there that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>awesome man Steve you&rsquo;ve done incredible</p>
<p>yeah and I probably can stay was gonna</p>
<p>be faster I think it&rsquo;s probably the</p>
<p>easiest thing I&rsquo;ve ever done I&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>to buy extra food</p>
<p>I can make one meal I&rsquo;m pretty simple</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s like oh I need to variety but</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re only doing one meal a day</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re pretty hungry but I got hungry</p>
<p>but you dyslexic okay I need some tastes</p>
<p>with the bacon bits of the cheese that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of like a little snack or one and</p>
<p>then you just salads because we have to</p>
<p>eat our salad every day the kale but</p>
<p>then I want something hot so then I have</p>
<p>my kind of mix talk that&rsquo;s my last one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the real good one and then after</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m actually kind of full you know</p>
<p>take a little bit of water and then I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>done and then we start our day again and</p>
<p>I find it harder to have the two or</p>
<p>three meals a day because you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>there trying to going hey I need to have</p>
<p>this mirror from here what do I do like</p>
<p>when I travel I just don&rsquo;t need I just</p>
<p>see when I get there</p>
<p>and you go to resort like ah this is</p>
<p>that resort you know two weeks you go to</p>
<p>the Japanese and say I just want shrimp</p>
<p>cooked and butter a lot broccoli give me</p>
<p>extra broccoli you just tell me what you</p>
<p>want you go to really get the eggs or if</p>
<p>you have a hamburger patty hamburger</p>
<p>patties they&rsquo;re everywhere</p>
<p>you know in now here in Canada I am W</p>
<p>has a lettuce wrap one just ask them is</p>
<p>no mayo because mustard no ketchups and</p>
<p>you can have a team burger you know in a</p>
<p>lettuce wrap here you know there&rsquo;s Q</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no excuse</p>
<p>nowadays for what&rsquo;s out there and the</p>
<p>other one I always believed in don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have so much fun my success really</p>
<p>wrapped up when I quit taking MCT oil</p>
<p>quit adding havoc Ottawa Ellen all these</p>
<p>fats you don&rsquo;t need it if you&rsquo;re like me</p>
<p>and you have it don&rsquo;t put it on just eat</p>
<p>regular food and do it that way and</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t go buy these good you know ketones</p>
<p>exhaustion Aidid like all that it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work he doesn&rsquo;t have to be high</p>
<p>like white ketones are not done in two</p>
<p>years we&rsquo;re never much over point eight</p>
<p>like on the blood I&rsquo;ve never had high</p>
<p>ketones so let me just explain that for</p>
<p>people that are watching in the</p>
<p>beginning sometimes you may need some</p>
<p>fat to go from one meal to the next but</p>
<p>as soon as you&rsquo;re adapted you want to</p>
<p>have the food with it with its natural</p>
<p>fat you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to take</p>
<p>all these oils and tons of fat you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really don&rsquo;t need that because then you</p>
<p>want your body to burn its own fat hey</p>
<p>Steve you had an incredible incredible</p>
<p>success what I&rsquo;m gonna do is I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>do another one let&rsquo;s say in a few months</p>
<p>yeah because I we have to we have to do</p>
<p>it so you hit your goal but you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>consistently coming down and it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>quite a miraculous amount of weight loss</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s incredible yeah so this is six</p>
<p>months I&rsquo;d like to get to my goal in six</p>
<p>months but it is getting tougher like</p>
<p>all a bit like some weeks you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like half a pound like I&rsquo;m used to</p>
<p>losing pretty consistently you know so</p>
<p>but you know I&rsquo;m not discouraged at all</p>
<p>but I know I&rsquo;m coming down in size but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting in much like like clothing</p>
<p>sizes going down but like even a</p>
<p>five-pound on me I&rsquo;ll drop another</p>
<p>coating size like down the waist they</p>
<p>come down to like a 38 waist extra large</p>
<p>and a lot of shirts and I was 8 X 38</p>
<p>waist yeah I&rsquo;m a 38 that&rsquo;s not bad</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a bad and I&rsquo;m still 264 right</p>
<p>ya know it&rsquo;s kind of weird I really</p>
<p>follow 11:00 so you know and most people</p>
<p>like you know I&rsquo;m into extra-large so</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;ll be able to hit 225 I like to</p>
<p>get down to there I&rsquo;m never gonna be the</p>
<p>190 like I&rsquo;m supposed to be I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think I could ever get to that Vlade</p>
<p>tiny thing yeah well I think I wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>change too much right now cuz your honor</p>
<p>your honor</p>
<p>you know these do you take these the</p>
<p>Biggest Loser these really big guys</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll lose very very unhealthily and</p>
<p>they gain it right back but I don&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>you gaining it back because you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>it correctly and what&rsquo;s been so easy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s never been like a diet or sex right</p>
<p>this is really easy lifestyle like the</p>
<p>food from the hardest thing is do the</p>
<p>exercise every day you doing that but</p>
<p>the food to me is like this is like the</p>
<p>easiest thing I try to lose weight my</p>
<p>whole life and the food is so good on</p>
<p>here like you don&rsquo;t need the chip said I</p>
<p>can have I&rsquo;ve two days and I&rsquo;m eating</p>
<p>pizzas are in front of your chips stuff</p>
<p>I used to lately it just even bother me</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even think about having it that</p>
<p>would you know and I don&rsquo;t even want to</p>
<p>have some all those wait till I&rsquo;m ready</p>
<p>to have something so what you get</p>
<p>adapted over that part there&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>more honey you can have a heart of it</p>
<p>the cheeses in that you know I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think the deli meats and that we prepare</p>
<p>stuffs at sites like bacon and eggs</p>
<p>whose carries about that it&rsquo;s not that</p>
<p>hard</p>
<p>no hey Steve thank you so much for the</p>
<p>interview and let&rsquo;s touch base in a few</p>
<p>months and see if the I&rsquo;ll check in with</p>
