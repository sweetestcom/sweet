    <p>Jay Welch, let me tell you what I&rsquo;ve had it with today.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hear it.</p>
<p>So I went to this yoga studio, and they make you sign all this shit.</p>
<p>So I gave my phone number.</p>
<p>So when I&rsquo;m leaving afterwards, I tell the girl straight up to her face, I can&rsquo;t ever</p>
<p>come back because it&rsquo;s too hot.</p>
<p>It was 85 degrees.</p>
<p>So I come out and tell her, and I was like, take me off your list.</p>
<p>Like I will never voluntarily go anywhere that&rsquo;s 85 degrees.</p>
<p>And they text me all the time, and I&rsquo;ve texted back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m never coming.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too hot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not personal to you or yoga.</p>
<p>But I just-</p>
<p>You would do like 50 degree yoga.</p>
<p>I could do 50 degree yoga, but not 85 degree yoga.</p>
<p>And they always try to sell me on, well, it&rsquo;s good for your joints, and I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>give a fuck.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a fuck what it does.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if it makes me look like J-Lo.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going anywhere for 85 degrees.</p>
<p>No hot yoga.</p>
<p>No hot yoga.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hot enough.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re harassing you.</p>
<p>Harassing.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>All right, pumps.</p>
<p>So before Jen and Nealey came to Oklahoma City, I FaceTimed them to see what they were</p>
<p>up to.</p>
<p>And this is no surprise where they were.</p>
<p>They were at REI.</p>
<p>What does that stand for?</p>
<p>REI, it&rsquo;s like a camping store.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;ve never heard of it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve never heard of REI?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like they sell like tents and shit.</p>
<p>So I said, well, what are y&rsquo;all buying at REI?</p>
<p>And I had to have them bring it because I&rsquo;ve got to show you this.</p>
<p>A tent.</p>
<p>So this-</p>
<p>A bucket.</p>
<p>Is a bucket.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It looks like a bucket, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a rope.</p>
<p>Do you have to go get your own water at the well or something?</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a bucket.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking the lid off of the bucket.</p>
<p>Audience, wait.</p>
<p>Hang on here.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fucking toilet seat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a toilet seat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a potty in a-</p>
<p>On top of a bucket.</p>
<p>Did you poop in that?</p>
<p>Did you pee in that?</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>What do you do for fun?</p>
<p>Poop in a bucket?</p>
<p>So you can imagine my horror.</p>
<p>And so I said, why on earth would you buy that?</p>
<p>This is 2022.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>We have modernized plumbing, waste, sewage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been modernized for decades, actually.</p>
<p>And they announced to me that they were going to buy a bucket.</p>
<p>And I was like, what?</p>
<p>And they said, well, it&rsquo;s a bucket.</p>
<p>And I was like, what?</p>
<p>And they said, well, it&rsquo;s a bucket.</p>
<p>And I was like, what?</p>
<p>And they said, well, it&rsquo;s a bucket.</p>
<p>And I was like, well, it&rsquo;s a bucket.</p>
<p>modernized plumbing, waste, sewage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been modernized for decades, actually.</p>
<p>And they announced to me, well, oh, we&rsquo;re getting this for Burning Man.</p>
<p>And I was like, so wait.</p>
<p>So like it&rsquo;s Burning Man, do you sleep there?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, yes.</p>
<p>And so then I said, what is Burning Man?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a outdoor concert, right?</p>
<p>I thought it was just a concert.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I thought.</p>
<p>Like a day trip to a music festival, right?</p>
<p>Where people dress like hipsters and run around playing dress up like they&rsquo;re unicorns.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m all for it.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s what, swing for the fences, knock yourselves out.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going for eight nights in 110 degree weather.</p>
<p>And there are tented neighborhoods.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re in such and such, exactly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lined up rows of tents for people to sleep in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a full on infrastructure out in Nevada.</p>
<p>With no plumbing.</p>
<p>There are porta-potties.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;d rather pee outside than on a porta-potty.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, especially Jen.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not going to want to get, climb out of her tent and walk over to the-</p>
<p>So is the porta-potty in the tent?</p>
<p>This will be-</p>
<p>Oh, the bucket is in the tent.</p>
<p>The bucket?</p>
<p>I mean, okay, but your port-a-lug or lug-a-log.</p>
<p>The porta-potties in the neighborhoods of the infrastructure that all these fucking</p>
<p>people go to in 110 degree-</p>
<p>How many people are there?</p>
<p>70,000.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for that week.</p>
<p>They pay money to go.</p>
<p>They pay.</p>
<p>Do they have like a shower?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I mean, I went in 2018 and I showered maybe once.</p>
<p>Like you bring your own portable, you know, you fill up the water and you just-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a shower.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a shower.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pouring water over your head.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I still had shampoo and everything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not even a hooker bath.</p>
<p>Yeah, no.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not even tits and bits.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>That is not a shower.</p>
<p>In no way does that resemble hygiene.</p>
<p>When do people start smelling?</p>
<p>You have to think people smell.</p>
<p>70,000 people, 110 degrees, a porta-potty in their living area.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re out in the desert.</p>
<p>The alkaline is really good for you.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really smell that much.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>I mean, you still-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s bullshit.</p>
<p>That is bullshit.</p>
<p>You still have the whore&rsquo;s bath.</p>
<p>You take care of yourself every day.</p>
<p>Do you shave your armpits?</p>
<p>Yeah, I bring a razor.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I would do it daily.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t grow it out.</p>
<p>As long as it&rsquo;s not like a-</p>
<p>Do you shave your vagine at Burning Man?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to be clean before I go.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Where would you do your vagine at Burning Man in a porta-potty?</p>
<p>Do you do it in the tent?</p>
<p>In my tent.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where you do all your private stuff.</p>
<p>Just have a vagine cleaning in the tent?</p>
<p>Now, who all sleeps in the tent?</p>
<p>Just the two of you?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Do you have like assigned to a neighborhood within the 70,000?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You have a camp.</p>
<p>So, this year will be 22 people in one camp.</p>
<p>I remember you talking about some sort of like meal plan and casserole at Burning Man</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ll take turns cooking.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Every evening.</p>
<p>110 degree heat.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like over a fire?</p>
<p>We use propane.</p>
<p>Give us an example of something.</p>
<p>What are you preparing?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Turkish.</p>
<p>So, I will be bringing some b√∂rekas, which is like puff pastry with cheese and spinach.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really nice meal.</p>
<p>We have a pizza oven.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;ll just pop it in the pizza oven.</p>
<p>At Burning Man, you have a pizza oven?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>So, okay.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this.</p>
<p>So, are you going to take a shit in this bucket?</p>
<p>Yes or no?</p>
<p>If I have to, if I absolutely have to, I will.</p>
<p>But then I will get rid of it.</p>
<p>Where do you take the shit once you&rsquo;re done?</p>
<p>The portos and dump it in there.</p>
<p>We have a shit ton of Clorox wipe, all kinds of antibacterial wipes.</p>
<p>Do you have a blow-up mattress or do you just sleep on the ground?</p>
<p>We have the whole setup.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really nice.</p>
<p>We have a comforter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 110 degrees.</p>
<p>Multiple pillows.</p>
<p>Pee in the bucket.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always 110.</p>
<p>Super nice.</p>
<p>Super nice.</p>
<p>In the evenings, it gets down to 45, 50.</p>
<p>It gets cold, which is another reason you don&rsquo;t want to leave your tent and you just</p>
<p>pee in the bucket.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What if you&rsquo;re in the middle of the night when you get up to pee and it turns out it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a poop?</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;re in a tent taking a dump in the middle of the night while someone&rsquo;s asleep</p>
<p>in that air.</p>
<p>I will kill you, Jen, if you poop by accident.</p>
<p>I mean, it happens.</p>
<p>I make no promises.</p>
<p>It happens.</p>
<p>It happens.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s your species.</p>
<p>It happens.</p>
<p>If your relationship can survive eight nights in a tent with a bucket to shit in, I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s golden.</p>
<p>I do too.</p>
<p>I mean, how could you not?</p>
<p>What drugs is everybody on?</p>
<p>All kinds of drugs.</p>
<p>I would think that would be the only thing that would make it even remotely palatable.</p>
<p>And so, what&rsquo;s the age group?</p>
<p>Gotta be young.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you, it&rsquo;s from age three to seven.</p>
<p>People take their kids?</p>
<p>People take their kids.</p>
<p>They bring their nannies so that they can party in the evenings while the nanny watches</p>
<p>the kids.</p>
<p>I would suggest if you just leave your child at home with the nanny.</p>
<p>Yeah, that would be optimal.</p>
<p>As much as I&rsquo;ve had it with everything that&rsquo;s been said so far, and the people pooping in</p>
<p>the bucket.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>I have one more question.</p>
<p>Is there a concert?</p>
<p>Or is it just people in tents shitting in buckets?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a whole thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an experience.</p>
<p>There are art structures all over the playa.</p>
<p>Everyone comes in and is gifting something to the 70,000.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the man and there&rsquo;s also the temple.</p>
<p>The temple is this structure that&rsquo;s your sacred place where people go each year and they drop</p>
<p>something off there where they want to just let go of it.</p>
<p>And then on that Sunday, after the burning of the man, that burns down too, so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>letting go of-</p>
<p>You can get drop pumps off there.</p>
<p>You totally can.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re more talking like a picture of your ex-husband, right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I saw a wedding dress last time that was hanging in the temple, ready to be burned.</p>
<p>If this isn&rsquo;t alarming enough, when I was FaceTiming, that&rsquo;s child&rsquo;s play compared to</p>
<p>what they told me happens next, and you&rsquo;re going to lose your fucking mind because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>still not over it.</p>
<p>They have these tents and this activity called the Cuddle Puddle, and people bring life-size</p>
<p>stuffed animals and all the people go into these tents and cuddle each other and the</p>
<p>stuffed animals in the Cuddle Puddle.</p>
<p>And I want to remind you and the audience at large, these are adults paying money to</p>
<p>go to 110 degree heat in a tent, shit in a bucket, and cuddle a goddamn stuffed animal.</p>
<p>Pumps, wouldn&rsquo;t you cuddle with me in a Cuddle Puddle?</p>
<p>I would cuddle with you, but not in a Cuddle Puddle and not outside and not where I had</p>
<p>to shit in a box.</p>
<p>No thanks.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not shitting in a box.</p>
<p>Forget about the shitting in a box.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t forget about that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big deal.</p>
<p>Right, but what about the Cuddle Puddle?</p>
<p>They have like a restaurant, like if you didn&rsquo;t bring food, you could go buy food, like a</p>
<p>concession stand, a food truck.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no monetary, the only thing you could buy on the playa is ice.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no money.</p>
<p>No legal tender.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Do people fuck each other for stuff?</p>
<p>I want nothing to do with organized fun, group activities, Cuddle Puddles.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all about pickleball.</p>
<p>Seems like I know somebody that went and took like a motorhome.</p>
<p>Do people take motorhomes there?</p>
<p>RVs, yeah, they take RVs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more like glamping.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really glamorous.</p>
<p>For me, 70,000 people-</p>
<p>Is enough now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an immediate now.</p>
<p>110 degrees is where you-</p>
<p>Immediate now.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even have to get into the plumbing issue.</p>
<p>Stuffed animals, cuddling with other human beings that you don&rsquo;t know well.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know where you get a life-size stuffed animal.</p>
<p>You should see all the shit.</p>
<p>She sent me an image.</p>
<p>They have these crates and all this shit packed up that they&rsquo;re taking to Burning Man, like</p>
<p>literally like they&rsquo;re moving out of their house.</p>
<p>All this shit in Jen and Nellie&rsquo;s dining room.</p>
<p>Are you going to get a little U-Haul?</p>
<p>How do you get it all down there?</p>
<p>We have a team that&rsquo;s working on all of that.</p>
<p>Our campmates.</p>
<p>But look at you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the oil painting of Pops with her smoking glove.</p>
<p>Pretty as a picture.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>Do you take your bicycles too?</p>
<p>We take our bicycles.</p>
<p>We bring our own water.</p>
<p>Like every-</p>
<p>So all the blue things are water?</p>
<p>The biggest thing is radical self-reliance.</p>
<p>So we rely on ourselves.</p>
<p>I support that.</p>
<p>I support radical self-reliance.</p>
<p>I support that too.</p>
<p>In a four season.</p>
<p>Flipped up with room service.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>The best kind of self-reliance.</p>
<p>The help of the butler and the concierge.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>All of it.</p>
<p>We have a guest who is somewhat of a Burning Man aficionado.</p>
<p>This guy has such a heart on for Burning Man that he has, he&rsquo;s bi-continental Burning</p>
<p>Man boy.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Disconnected.</p>
<p>I guess it takes all kinds.</p>
<p>Hi Bobbitt.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s it going?</p>
<p>Hi Bobbitt.</p>
<p>Any relation to Lorena?</p>
<p>There is none.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re probably the last generation that will remember that.</p>
<p>Nobody younger than us is ever going to understand this.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Given my marriage, I think it was a missed opportunity on my part.</p>
<p>I should have followed her lead.</p>
<p>Would have saved me lots of time and energy.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, what I like about what she did is like, you know, women have thought that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, and then you get over it, rational thought resumes.</p>
<p>You realize that you can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s homicidal, somewhat sociopathic.</p>
<p>She committed.</p>
<p>She committed.</p>
<p>Threw it out the car window.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then she took it, drove off with it, and threw that penis out of the window.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>She actually morally did the correct thing, yet he was able to profit off it and do his</p>
<p>like weird porno and all that kind of stuff with a ton of money.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And he was clearly like a piece of crap.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just a bad person.</p>
<p>So Bobbitt, we just found out about, I mean, I&rsquo;d heard of Burning Man, Pumps had heard</p>
<p>of Burning Man.</p>
<p>I thought it was a concert.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jennifer, and this is Pumps, by the way.</p>
<p>I thought it was like a music festival, a one-day event.</p>
<p>And kind of like an overnight Coachella kind of thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>I had no idea that what goes on, because these ladies, I FaceTime them, and they&rsquo;re at REI</p>
<p>buying a toilet bucket.</p>
<p>Just alarming revelation after alarming revelation that leads to the cuddle puddles, which I</p>
<p>cannot wrap my head around.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>How many burns?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been to four burns at Black Rock City, and then my wife and I have also been to Burning</p>
<p>Man, what&rsquo;s called the Africa burn in South Africa.</p>
<p>So do you sleep outside, or do you take like a mobile camper?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done it a couple of different ways.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done tent twice, and I&rsquo;ve rented an RV once, and I had a camper van one time.</p>
<p>The RV was nice because it had like not a generator, it had air conditioning, it had</p>
<p>a microwave.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I did it up.</p>
<p>I had my own little bathroom and everything.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not shitting in a bucket in a tent in front of your spouse.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>But that was special because that was the second year anniversary of my wife and I meeting</p>
<p>and falling in love with Burning Man.</p>
<p>So we wanted to go back and do it up with style, but ever since then, it&rsquo;s just nothing</p>
<p>but tents.</p>
<p>That is sweet.</p>
<p>And I will say, I use the portos, but I&rsquo;m still a little bougie.</p>
<p>I have a portable bidet, because I got to stay a little clean.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the effort.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s way more, a much better burner than you two are.</p>
<p>Listen, he doesn&rsquo;t need a bucket.</p>
<p>He can use a bottle if he needed to.</p>
<p>That is true.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So he needs a bottle.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all he needs.</p>
<p>But the bidet is kind of a stroke of genius.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a gallon jug with a funnel and a hose, so that I can be lazy if I&rsquo;m too drunk</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t have to go to the portos.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this.</p>
<p>Do you go to the cuddle puddle?</p>
<p>I do not go to the big one.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It kind of scares me.</p>
<p>It terrifies me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally a dark room, and there&rsquo;s like a hundred people, and they&rsquo;re just touching</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want them to touch me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know them.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so weird.</p>
<p>Does it smell?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Someone just opened the door for me last time and showed me what it was, and I immediately</p>
<p>turned around.</p>
<p>I was like, no, thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would be.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need any of that.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m down to cuddle with people I&rsquo;m friends with and I&rsquo;ve made friends with.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t want to be in a dark room with people I&rsquo;ve never met.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So do you cuddle at Burning Man with other people in a small, like in your neighborhood?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Our whole camp will end up doing a cuddle at some point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve cuddled with Bobbitt before.</p>
<p>Are you still burning?</p>
<p>Are you spooning?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Is it like a row of spoons in a silverware drawer?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s too organized for us.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It just kind of happens naturally.</p>
<p>Bodies just start kind of forming and you&rsquo;re like, oh, coziness, putting your fur coats</p>
<p>on.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>My question would be, are these people attractive at all?</p>
<p>I mean, we know they smell, so they&rsquo;d have to be pretty attractive, but I would always</p>
<p>fear that I&rsquo;d get stuck with the unattractive people.</p>
<p>I would not want to just strut around naked in front of 70,000 people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t do the naked walk around for everybody, but I would say there&rsquo;s some really beautiful</p>
<p>people out there.</p>
<p>So like Burning Man for you, is it like kind of the climax of your year?</p>
<p>Like everything kind of, like for me, I go to the Amalfi Coast every summer and I love</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And when I&rsquo;m not there, I can visualize in my brain the sun hitting the water and the</p>
<p>water kind of sparkles.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is that what Burning Man is for you?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>We have a gigantic 50 by 30 foot room that all it is right now is Burning Man prep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nonstop.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We just saw Gin and Nilly&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll even hang out with some friends.</p>
<p>We just saw Gin and Nilly&rsquo;s and we were like, are you all moving or what?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s the fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge process.</p>
<p>I get to bring all my tools and I like to build stuff and I always do find out new little</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>Like when it comes to engineering, you know, we&rsquo;re building our own sinks, we build our</p>
<p>own showers.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just learning things all the time.</p>
<p>This year I&rsquo;ve been learning about how to splice LED wirings.</p>
<p>So you can light your tent, your little neighborhood with your.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to light the tent, we&rsquo;re going to light our bikes, going to light the backpack,</p>
<p>you know, a whole bunch of things we got to do.</p>
<p>I appreciate how industrious you are because like me, you said you like learning all this</p>
<p>new stuff.</p>
<p>I really, I don&rsquo;t want to learn anything new.</p>
<p>I really am completely content.</p>
<p>Like going to a hotel and saying, y&rsquo;all know how the inner workings of this hotel, you</p>
<p>know how to change the sheets, you know how to wash the towels, you know how to refill</p>
<p>the shampoo.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to let y&rsquo;all have it.</p>
<p>Burning Man is a way for me to learn cool things and new things.</p>
<p>But in the same vein, I am also a very posh traveler.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like Airbnbs.</p>
<p>They always ask me to like fold towels for them and do dishes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m out there for that.</p>
<p>I just give you money.</p>
<p>I want to go to a nice hotel.</p>
<p>Like the first thing we do when we&rsquo;re leaving Burning Man is we&rsquo;re going to a very fancy</p>
<p>resort.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>Nice hot bath.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to get the hot tub.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to get a massage.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go for it.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>What I would do is I would forego Burning Man and do all 10 days at the fancy hotel.</p>
<p>I mean, and I would just be tickling, but I have a couple of questions.</p>
<p>Number one, is anybody worried about monkey pox or COVID at Burning Man?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure some people are.</p>
<p>It sounds like the perfect petri dish.</p>
<p>That cuddle puddle.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s going to be some monkey pox, COVID, and maybe even a new hybrid.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about the same exact kind of hippies that thought drinking urine could</p>
<p>cure COVID.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>There is a lot of potential.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I had COVID recently.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not that worried, so I&rsquo;m just going to get through it.</p>
<p>How much does it cost to get a tent spot at Burning Man?</p>
<p>All you&rsquo;re doing is getting a ticket, and the tickets are like $600.</p>
<p>Per person?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then you bring everything else on your own.</p>
<p>You can buy ice out there, but that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>So it can be as cheap as you want or as expensive as you want.</p>
<p>So I want to reveal something to pumps that you probably know that Jen and Nellie told</p>
<p>me, and this is, I mean, this gets worse.</p>
<p>When you leave, when you&rsquo;re ready to get the fuck out of there and you&rsquo;ve got the vision</p>
<p>of this nice hotel, the bath, clean your ass, cold, refrigerated air, it takes six hours</p>
<p>to drive out of the facility.</p>
<p>Or more, right?</p>
<p>Or more.</p>
<p>I actually have sat through 25 hours once.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even kidding.</p>
<p>It was the year I met my wife, it was 25 hours.</p>
<p>There was a 17-year-old girl who had come there, who&rsquo;d gone with their parents, and</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t find her.</p>
<p>She went off on her own little adventure, but they released an Amber alert.</p>
<p>And so they shut down all of Exit It.</p>
<p>They shut down everything.</p>
<p>So no one could go in or out until they found this girl, and this girl had just been out</p>
<p>partying with some friends that she made.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d fucking kill her.</p>
<p>Oh, it was all over her mind.</p>
<p>I would strangle her with my bare hands.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay, let me ask you this.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t they have more than one road out of Burning Man?</p>
<p>It sounds like the infrastructure could use an update.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re on an Indian reservation that literally has one road.</p>
<p>And so they try to manage it as much as possible, so you&rsquo;re not ruining the entire lives of</p>
<p>these 30,000 people that live out on this reservation.</p>
<p>So they try to keep it narrow as possible, but I wouldn&rsquo;t mind having a second road.</p>
<p>I could get to Reno faster and get a cheeseburger and go to my hotel.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the big deal that you&rsquo;re going to do for the group?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here to build everything.</p>
<p>I bring my tools and I get to work.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a man.</p>
<p>Okay, so you said you built a shower.</p>
<p>It brings tools.</p>
<p>How do you&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you bring the stuff to make the shower?</p>
<p>Like the plumbing?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we have&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a wooden structure that&rsquo;s built off of a pallet, and then it&rsquo;s on top of like</p>
<p>a heavy, thick, black plastic that&rsquo;s also wrapped around a gigantic rectangle that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about 20 feet by 20 feet.</p>
<p>So the excess water goes down onto this thing and it evaporates out, so we don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>take any extra water out.</p>
<p>Did you kind of black out when he described all that?</p>
<p>No, I was just thinking if I ever have to go like on survivor island, I want him.</p>
<p>Just because I thought&hellip;</p>
<p>He knows so much.</p>
<p>No, for sure.</p>
<p>I want him.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>I mean, if like apocalypse comes, I&rsquo;m going to be like, hey, Jen Morton, remember that</p>
<p>Bobbit dude giving me his address?</p>
<p>Yeah, we need him.</p>
<p>Thomas and I are going out.</p>
<p>Your wife would be like, get these fucking women out of here.</p>
<p>I hate them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think she needed that handy.</p>
<p>My dad&rsquo;s like, you need to marry a handyman.</p>
<p>Pops, you&rsquo;re getting a hit on married men on our podcast.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just saying in general.</p>
<p>We interviewed a guy the other day and she said she&rsquo;s basically opening up herself to</p>
<p>butt play.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re hitting on married men.</p>
<p>You have got to contain yourself, for God&rsquo;s sakes.</p>
<p>I apologize, Pops.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying a handyman is hard to find.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t find him because he&rsquo;s married to a nice lady from Belgium who is a chef.</p>
<p>All she wants to do is cook food for her man and all he wants to do is build shit for</p>
<p>his woman.</p>
<p>And you can throw a grenade right in their fucking relationship.</p>
<p>I am so sorry, Bobbit.</p>
<p>I apologize from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize it was sexual harassment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m from Texas.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m used to it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually impressed that you hit on Bobbit, even though I disapprove.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t hit on him.</p>
<p>You clearly did.</p>
<p>I was just making the point.</p>
<p>You clearly did.</p>
<p>It was obvious.</p>
<p>You did.</p>
<p>It was.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go back to Sona later.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s her name?</p>
<p>Sona.</p>
<p>Sona.</p>
<p>Tell Sona I didn&rsquo;t mean to.</p>
<p>It was accidental.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just so averted.</p>
<p>I feel crazy.</p>
<p>So Bobbit, let me just tell you one thing that I could get down with cuddle puddling</p>
<p>with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not human beings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not oversized stuffed animals, but I can cuddle puddle with my dogs.</p>
<p>I could for days on end, for days on end.</p>
<p>I love my dogs so much.</p>
<p>My kids come into my office and I have a framed picture of Larry David on my desk, a picture</p>
<p>of me and my dogs.</p>
<p>And my son says, Mom, why do you not have any pictures of me in your office?</p>
<p>And I mean, honestly, it never occurred to me until he said it.</p>
<p>Like I love humanity.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t like human beings.</p>
<p>No, exactly.</p>
<p>But I love dogs.</p>
<p>I love dogs.</p>
<p>Do you take the dog to Burning Man?</p>
<p>No, you can&rsquo;t take animals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a really harsh environment.</p>
<p>And like, even people who have actual disabilities and service animals, they&rsquo;re encouraged to</p>
<p>not bring the dog.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the most, like is pot the most, the drug that&rsquo;s used the most?</p>
<p>I cannot believe you just said pot.</p>
<p>Or what do you call it?</p>
<p>Weed?</p>
<p>Weed.</p>
<p>What do the kids call marijuana these days?</p>
<p>I like saying marijuana.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>Marijuana.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s the most prevalent drug, like psychedelics, pot?</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I guess this runs with whatever circle you&rsquo;re in, but I&rsquo;m going to say it&rsquo;s probably things</p>
<p>like either psychedelics, coke, or molly is probably the thing that you&rsquo;ll see most people</p>
<p>have out there, I guess.</p>
<p>But I mean, pot, marijuana, weed, whatever you want to call it, that is like just a given.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like every single camp.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s like 800 people just smoking it in a two-person corner.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It just happens.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And it is what it is.</p>
<p>But I mean, obviously alcohol I think is the number one consumed thing.</p>
<p>But you have to keep it cold.</p>
<p>Which is the worst.</p>
<p>I guess you don&rsquo;t have to keep it cold.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to, but I would recommend it.</p>
<p>Like a beer.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want a hot beer.</p>
<p>So this time that you go with Jen and Nellie, are you sleeping in the tent?</p>
<p>Are you taking the&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, this year we got fancy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a 10-person tent that has two rooms.</p>
<p>And I went and I bought a futon.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re sleeping on the ground.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re bringing full sheets, bedding, everything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m building like a swamp cooler to keep the tent room cool.</p>
<p>You are doing it right.</p>
<p>How many nights are you sleeping here at Burning Man?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s eight or nine nights.</p>
<p>Eight or nine nights.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s nine nights.</p>
<p>A long time.</p>
<p>With 100,000 people.</p>
<p>And then you have to wait for six to 25 hours.</p>
<p>Six to 25 hours.</p>
<p>Six to 25 hours to GTFO.</p>
<p>I would leave two days early to avoid the rush.</p>
<p>I really would.</p>
<p>Like I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>We have to watch the burn.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to watch it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to wait and watch the burn.</p>
<p>See, that&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how they get their hooks in you.</p>
<p>They name it Burning Man.</p>
<p>They make a big fat sculpture.</p>
<p>They make a big fat man.</p>
<p>And then you think, like Pomp said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to get the fuck out of here two days early.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to beat the crowd.</p>
<p>But then you&rsquo;re like&hellip;</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>I would leave and I would feel zero guilt about missing the burn.</p>
<p>Would you?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Duh.</p>
<p>So will you and your wife cuddle with Gin and Neely?</p>
<p>Oh, 100%.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to do that every time we see them.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even need to do that.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to be at Burning Man to do that, by the way.</p>
<p>Just do a little cuddle.</p>
<p>I will cuddle with him on a Tuesday night.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sweet.</p>
<p>I have one more question.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a diehard Burning Man fan.</p>
<p>What do you think of the people that bring their, like, toddlers?</p>
<p>You know, actually my wife and I, once our kids get to a certain age,</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t figured that age out yet,</p>
<p>but we plan on taking our kids, too.</p>
<p>See, I would think that you would be like,</p>
<p>why the fuck are you bringing your kids?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely some people that bring their kids out</p>
<p>that are not being appropriate</p>
<p>and, like, maybe getting too high around their kids.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t plan on doing that.</p>
<p>Like, I plan on showing my kids that they can be inventive,</p>
<p>artistic, and have fun and explore</p>
<p>and play throughout the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t plan on being totally shit-faced around my kids.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to see all the pictures.</p>
<p>I want to see the pictures.</p>
<p>Yeah, I want a full‚Ä¶</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have some fun ones for you.</p>
<p>We should do a recap.</p>
<p>Yes, let&rsquo;s do a recap after Burning Man.</p>
<p>We should do a Burning Man recap, and I want videos.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And everybody thinks that we can put them up here.</p>
<p>Bobbitt the Builder,</p>
<p>I cannot thank you enough for coming on this‚Ä¶</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a treat, Bob.</p>
<p>‚Ä¶stellar podcast here.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t start calling him Bob.</p>
<p>Quit hitting on Bobbitt.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve told her, like, 10,000 times, Bobbitt&rsquo;s married.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting Bobbitt nice and red now.</p>
<p>Just a man with a beard and tools.</p>
<p>These look so red.</p>
<p>Man with the power tools.</p>
<p>I need a man with power tools.</p>
<p>Pops is over here, like, you know, she just learned about‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I just said, it was great seeing you, Bob.</p>
<p>She just learned about the ass play,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re hitting on Bobbitt the Builder.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>What a day.</p>
<p>All right, thanks, Bob.</p>
<p>Thanks, Bob.</p>
<p>Have a great trip.</p>
<p>Yeah, have fun.</p>
<p>Feel the burn.</p>
<p>Feel the burn.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe how turned on you were</p>
<p>by how industrious he was.</p>
<p>I need a man with some power tools.</p>
<p>He mentions the tools,</p>
<p>and you immediately are like,</p>
<p>you know, you just can&rsquo;t find those kind of men anymore.</p>
<p>My dad always told me,</p>
<p>if you find a handyman, grab him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shame you&rsquo;re married, Bob.</p>
<p>You said that.</p>
<p>You said that.</p>
<p>Rewind the tape.</p>
<p>I see this.</p>
<p>Bob was single,</p>
<p>and he lived in the area.</p>
<p>Why are you so much younger than me?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s not hard to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so much younger.</p>
<p>Fuck off.</p>
<p>You are not.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re such a bitch.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>Have you had it with me?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Bye, everyone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hear it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>All I can say about that is,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
