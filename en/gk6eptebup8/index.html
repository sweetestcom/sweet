Transcript ﻿now i haven&amp;rsquo;t done a video on microwaves i want to give you my opinion and anything that i say that conflicts with what you know if you&amp;rsquo;ve found some studies or references that conflict put it down in the comments section below i&amp;rsquo;m always interested in new research and especially research that&amp;rsquo;s been suppressed because when you evaluate anything on the internet a lot of times you&amp;rsquo;ll find that information is suppressed a lot of the facts are not easily found i mean let&amp;rsquo;s take for example crisco it&amp;rsquo;s been considered somewhat healthy for 97 years until they found out it&amp;rsquo;s actually pretty dangerous right so there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of things in the market for a long period of time considered safe so i&amp;rsquo;m just going to give you my opinion on microwaves i do have a microwave oven i don&amp;rsquo;t really use it it&amp;rsquo;s not that i&amp;rsquo;m concerned about it i just don&amp;rsquo;t use it because i use the oven mostly so let&amp;rsquo;s just kind of go through some definitions here the definition of radiating means traveling outward in all directions from a source okay then we have radiation which is the transmission of energy in the form of particles or waves through space or a medium like food a body or even a wall and so some people have this consideration if they microwave the food that it&amp;rsquo;s going to be now radioactive in some way let&amp;rsquo;s close it up right now there&amp;rsquo;s actually two types of radiation you have ionizing radiation and you have non-ionizing radiation ionizing radiation breaks one or more electrons from the atom it&amp;rsquo;s deeper it can create dna damage and that would be like gamma rays or x-rays or even to some degree uv radiation but then you have non-ionizing radiation which can disrupt bonds of molecules but not necessarily the atoms but in the research of microwaves apparently it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even break the bonds it just vibrates the bonds so it might disrupt the bonds in some way and it creates heat so that&amp;rsquo;s really how microwaves affect the food they&amp;rsquo;re vibrating the food to a certain degree which creates heat all right so microwaves can lower the nutrient value in food for sure depending on how long it&amp;rsquo;s being microwaved but of course heat in general lowers the nutrient content in food the big problem with microwaves is what you cook your food in if you&amp;rsquo;re using plastics the heat is going to break down that plastic and put it in your food and there&amp;rsquo;s been some pretty hardcore research on this and our bodies are accumulating a lot of micro plastics and this is definitely one source so if you&amp;rsquo;re going to use a microwave cook in glass or ceramics okay but don&amp;rsquo;t use plastics in a microwave now the other very important point about microwaves is that you do not want to stand anywhere near the microwave oven when it&amp;rsquo;s on now usually they have a little filter in there with those little dots do not be looking in the microwave when you&amp;rsquo;re cooking anything in fact i would walk away to the point where you&amp;rsquo;re not even 15 to 20 feet in the direction where that microwave is and the reason is this because those waves coming from the microwave can affect the cornea of your eye and the last thing you want to do is vibrate the small molecular structures of your eye and start to cook the lens of the eye which is very sensitive to heat so you just want to be completely away from the microwave and a few days ago i used my emf tester on the microwave i wanted to see how far these waves extended from the microwave when it was on i had my emf set to radiation waves and it was definitely significant at 15 feet away from that microwave so if you&amp;rsquo;re going to use a microwave stand all the way to the side be away from the microwave hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it&amp;rsquo;s a free course i want you to take it and here&amp;rsquo;s why here&amp;rsquo;s you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right

microwaves i want to give you my opinion  </p><p>and anything that i say that 
conflicts with what you know if you&rsquo;ve  </p><p>found some studies or references that conflict 
put it down in the comments section below i&rsquo;m  </p><p>always interested in new research and especially 
research that&rsquo;s been suppressed because when  </p><p>you evaluate anything on the internet a lot of 
times you&rsquo;ll find that information is suppressed  </p><p>a lot of the facts are not easily found i mean 
let&rsquo;s take for example crisco it&rsquo;s been considered  </p><p>somewhat healthy for 97 years until they 
found out it&rsquo;s actually pretty dangerous right  </p><p>so there&rsquo;s a lot of things in the market for 
a long period of time considered safe so i&rsquo;m  </p><p>just going to give you my opinion on microwaves 
i do have a microwave oven i don&rsquo;t really use it  </p><p>it&rsquo;s not that i&rsquo;m concerned about it i just don&rsquo;t 
use it because i use the oven mostly so let&rsquo;s just  </p><p>kind of go through some definitions here the 
definition of radiating means traveling outward  </p><p>in all directions from a source okay then we have 
radiation which is the transmission of energy  </p><p>in the form of particles or waves through space 
or a medium like food a body or even a wall  </p><p>and so some people have this 
consideration if they microwave the food  </p><p>that it&rsquo;s going to be now radioactive in some way 
let&rsquo;s close it up right now there&rsquo;s actually two  </p><p>types of radiation you have ionizing radiation and 
you have non-ionizing radiation ionizing radiation  </p><p>breaks one or more electrons from the atom 
it&rsquo;s deeper it can create dna damage and that  </p><p>would be like gamma rays or x-rays or even to some 
degree uv radiation but then you have non-ionizing  </p><p>radiation which can disrupt bonds of molecules 
but not necessarily the atoms but in the research  </p><p>of microwaves apparently it doesn&rsquo;t even break 
the bonds it just vibrates the bonds so it might  </p><p>disrupt the bonds in some way and it creates heat 
so that&rsquo;s really how microwaves affect the food  </p><p>they&rsquo;re vibrating the food to a certain degree 
which creates heat all right so microwaves  </p><p>can lower the nutrient value in food for sure 
depending on how long it&rsquo;s being microwaved but of  </p><p>course heat in general lowers the nutrient content 
in food the big problem with microwaves is what  </p><p>you cook your food in if you&rsquo;re using plastics 
the heat is going to break down that plastic  </p><p>and put it in your food and there&rsquo;s been 
some pretty hardcore research on this and  </p><p>our bodies are accumulating a lot of micro 
plastics and this is definitely one source so  </p><p>if you&rsquo;re going to use a microwave cook in 
glass or ceramics okay but don&rsquo;t use plastics  </p><p>in a microwave now the other very important point 
about microwaves is that you do not want to stand  </p><p>anywhere near the microwave oven when it&rsquo;s on 
now usually they have a little filter in there  </p><p>with those little dots do not be looking in the 
microwave when you&rsquo;re cooking anything in fact  </p><p>i would walk away to the point where you&rsquo;re 
not even 15 to 20 feet in the direction  </p><p>where that microwave is and the reason is this 
because those waves coming from the microwave  </p><p>can affect the cornea of your eye and 
the last thing you want to do is vibrate  </p><p>the small molecular structures of your eye 
and start to cook the lens of the eye which  </p><p>is very sensitive to heat so you just want to 
be completely away from the microwave and a few  </p><p>days ago i used my emf tester on the microwave 
i wanted to see how far these waves extended  </p><p>from the microwave when it was on i had my emf 
set to radiation waves and it was definitely  </p><p>significant at 15 feet away from that microwave 
so if you&rsquo;re going to use a microwave stand all  </p><p>the way to the side be away from the microwave hey 
before you go real quick i have a course entitled  </p><p>how to bulletproof your immune system it&rsquo;s a 
free course i want you to take it and here&rsquo;s why  </p><p>here&rsquo;s you here is your environment everyone 
is focused on this over here avoiding  </p><p>your environment but what about here what about 
strengthening your immune system that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s  </p><p>missing this course will show you how to 
bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate  </p><p>and resist your environment much better by 
strengthening your own immune system i put  </p><p>a link down in the description right down
