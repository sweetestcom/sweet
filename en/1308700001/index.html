    <p>This series is something that&rsquo;s been a long time coming,</p>
<p>an idea I&rsquo;ve had for years, and over the last year at AudioChuck</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been putting together the right team of people</p>
<p>to make this show a reality.</p>
<p>Those of you who are deep in the true crime community</p>
<p>might know about cold case playing card decks.</p>
<p>Some law enforcement agencies have replaced the faces</p>
<p>of traditional playing cards with images of missing</p>
<p>and murdered people.</p>
<p>Each card represents a victim who&rsquo;s gone without justice.</p>
<p>The goal was to get these out to the public and into jails and prisons,</p>
<p>hoping that they might finally find their way into the hands</p>
<p>of someone with answers.</p>
<p>And now, it&rsquo;s time to bring these cases to a bigger audience,</p>
<p>hoping each of these stories will finally hit the right ears.</p>
<p>Our card this week is Linda Smith, the Nine of Hearts from Idaho.</p>
<p>In 1981, in her hometown of Pocatello, Idaho,</p>
<p>14-year-old Linda Smith was abducted from her family&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>Whoever took her all those decades ago snuck past her sleeping brother</p>
<p>and into her bedroom, and to this day that person remains unidentified.</p>
<p>To help tell us Linda&rsquo;s story, our team interviewed Linda&rsquo;s brother Ben</p>
<p>on the 40th anniversary of his sister&rsquo;s kidnapping.</p>
<p>What he remembers about this gripping story will leave you shook.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious that the photo of Linda Smith on her playing card</p>
<p>is her middle school picture from 1981.</p>
<p>According to her younger brother Ben, it&rsquo;s exactly how she looked</p>
<p>when she vanished from their home.</p>
<p>In the picture, she&rsquo;s got a little smile across her face</p>
<p>and is sort of looking off to the side.</p>
<p>You know, the typical middle school girl,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get my picture taken a lot, pose.</p>
<p>Her short, wavy brown hair is parted down the middle,</p>
<p>and underneath the photo are the words, homicide victim.</p>
<p>This is how the Pocatello Police Department categorizes Linda,</p>
<p>and sadly, it has been that way for four decades.</p>
<p>On the night of June 14th, 1981, school was out for the summer,</p>
<p>and Linda and her younger siblings, nine-year-old Ben and 13-year-old Lori,</p>
<p>were having a typical Sunday evening.</p>
<p>Linda, who was 14, was babysitting Ben at home</p>
<p>while their mother, Noreen, was having a night out with some friends,</p>
<p>and Lori was spending the night at their grandparents&rsquo; house</p>
<p>about 45 minutes north in the town of Basalt, Idaho.</p>
<p>According to Ben, he and Linda&rsquo;s evening at home that night</p>
<p>was uneventful for the most part.</p>
<p>The pair watched some TV together in the living room,</p>
<p>then Ben dozed off.</p>
<p>When he stirred awake, it was late, and the house was completely dark.</p>
<p>Their mom still wasn&rsquo;t home yet, and when he looked over next to him,</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t see Linda.</p>
<p>At that point, he figured his sister had just gone into her bedroom</p>
<p>and fallen asleep too.</p>
<p>But right as he was thinking that,</p>
<p>something happened that changed his family&rsquo;s life forever.</p>
<p>-&ldquo;Sometime during the night, I felt a bump against the recliner.</p>
<p>I look up, and there&rsquo;s this guy with Linda in his arms.</p>
<p>And it takes me a few minutes to get fully awake.</p>
<p>By that time, he&rsquo;s out of the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a split second, Ben thought he was dreaming,</p>
<p>but quickly realized he wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>An actual stranger, a man Ben did not know,</p>
<p>had Linda fighting for her life in his arms.</p>
<p>She was kicking, struggling, and trying to scream.</p>
<p>-&ldquo;He had one arm around her mouth like this,</p>
<p>and the other one around her waist.</p>
<p>And he used the one that he used around his waist as the one that it was,</p>
<p>because she was trying to scream, and it was muffled, and nobody heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Ben could even really process what was going on,</p>
<p>the man with a death grip on Linda</p>
<p>rushed toward the home&rsquo;s back door, toward an alleyway.</p>
<p>Ben says everything happened so fast,</p>
<p>he barely had time to get his little body out of the recliner</p>
<p>and start running after his sister and her abductor.</p>
<p>-&ldquo;I chased him to the back of the house</p>
<p>and tried to pull him away from her.</p>
<p>And I got pushed down into some, we had some weeds,</p>
<p>not weeds, but bushes along the side of the house there.</p>
<p>And I got pushed down into the bushes.</p>
<p>Basically, I was told to get away or I was going to get hurt.</p>
<p>And by the time I got up out of the bushes,</p>
<p>they had gotten into the vehicle in the alleyway, and they were gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben says back in 1981, and in his nine-year-old mind,</p>
<p>he couldn&rsquo;t really make sense of things,</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t have a good grasp</p>
<p>on what time the abduction actually happened.</p>
<p>But there was one detail he remembers without a doubt.</p>
<p>The van he saw the strange man stuff Linda into was black</p>
<p>and had flames down the side of it.</p>
<p>As soon as the van took off,</p>
<p>Ben says he immediately ran to a neighbor&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>across the street to call 911,</p>
<p>because at the time, the Smiths didn&rsquo;t have a phone in their home.</p>
<p>In fact, the family was way more into CB radios than telephones.</p>
<p>Noreen, their mom, was really into the hobby.</p>
<p>She was a member of the Southeast Idaho CB Radio Club,</p>
<p>and the whole family had their own radio handles.</p>
<p>Noreen was White Angel,</p>
<p>Lori was Dark Angel,</p>
<p>Ben was Littlest Angel,</p>
<p>and Linda was Teen Angel.</p>
<p>They jokingly called their house</p>
<p>the Honky Tonk Angel Base.</p>
<p>We were so redneck, it&rsquo;s not even funny.</p>
<p>The reason Ben was so quick to go over to a neighbor&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and call 911 after Linda&rsquo;s abduction</p>
<p>was that he&rsquo;d heard in school,</p>
<p>if something bad happens, you always call 911.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the golden rule we teach pretty much every kid,</p>
<p>but Ben never imagined what would happen</p>
<p>and how investigators would treat him</p>
<p>after he dialed those famous three numbers.</p>
<p>According to the Pocatello Police Department,</p>
<p>when Ben placed the 911 call to report Linda&rsquo;s abduction,</p>
<p>it was just after two o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>
<p>By this time, Noreen was on her way home</p>
<p>when she got a page on her car&rsquo;s CB radio.</p>
<p>It was the police, and they were looking for White Angel.</p>
<p>Ben doesn&rsquo;t remember his mom going out all the time.</p>
<p>He said she worked hard to provide for her three kids</p>
<p>as a single mom.</p>
<p>Their dad was never in the picture.</p>
<p>Patrol officers responded to the Smiths&rsquo; house</p>
<p>with less than enthusiastic attitudes</p>
<p>that Ben&rsquo;s report of an abduction was in fact legit.</p>
<p>Ben says the officer&rsquo;s initial response to his panic</p>
<p>was to calm him down and suggest</p>
<p>that his sister likely voluntarily left with someone</p>
<p>and ran away.</p>
<p>He said when he protested against that theory,</p>
<p>the police immediately accused him of making up the story</p>
<p>about Linda being kidnapped.</p>
<p>They suggested that Ben&rsquo;s nine-year-old imagination</p>
<p>was getting the best of him</p>
<p>and that he was just covering up for Linda</p>
<p>taking off on her own.</p>
<p>They thought this because some other reports</p>
<p>had come into the department earlier that night</p>
<p>that indicated a party was going on in the neighborhood</p>
<p>a few streets over.</p>
<p>The police, according to Ben,</p>
<p>suggested that most likely Linda would have wanted</p>
<p>to sneak off to the party.</p>
<p>They had two very inexperienced patrolmen</p>
<p>investigating a possible kidnapping</p>
<p>they thought was a runaway.</p>
<p>They even went down to,</p>
<p>there was a party going up on Clark Street</p>
<p>a few blocks away from where we were living,</p>
<p>and they went there to go look for Linda.</p>
<p>Not once did they believe that</p>
<p>I saw somebody take my sister.</p>
<p>Ben said officers doubted him so much</p>
<p>that by the time his mom arrived on scene,</p>
<p>he even started to doubt himself.</p>
<p>His mind kept racing over the scene he&rsquo;d experienced</p>
<p>inside the house and in the alley.</p>
<p>And he questioned if it was real.</p>
<p>Even when I told them what I witnessed that night,</p>
<p>what I seen, and I was in shock.</p>
<p>So I would forget things and then I would remember things.</p>
<p>So of course that to them looked like it was lying.</p>
<p>So I was covering up for her.</p>
<p>But Ben knew that what he saw was real.</p>
<p>When it came to dealing with law enforcement,</p>
<p>he never retracted his initial statement.</p>
<p>What didn&rsquo;t help the situation was the fact</p>
<p>that Ben had very little helpful information</p>
<p>to give the police about the identity</p>
<p>of the man who he said took Linda.</p>
<p>He had no idea who this man was.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d never seen him before in his life.</p>
<p>All he remembered was that for a split second,</p>
<p>he was able to look into the guy&rsquo;s eyes,</p>
<p>though he couldn&rsquo;t be descriptive about them.</p>
<p>He knew that the man had a beard</p>
<p>and he described the suspect</p>
<p>as wearing a hooded sweatshirt or jacket</p>
<p>with the hood pulled up around his face.</p>
<p>And there was a smell that he can still recall</p>
<p>to this very day.</p>
<p>And anymore, I honestly can&rsquo;t remember a whole lot</p>
<p>of what I recognized from that.</p>
<p>Kind of the eyes and the smell of beer alcohol</p>
<p>and body odor, sweat.</p>
<p>Will send me into a PTSD trigger,</p>
<p>I mean, downward spiral.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Those two combinations together</p>
<p>sends me into a downward spiral</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m that nine-year-old kid again.</p>
<p>I think one of the reasons police</p>
<p>might&rsquo;ve initially doubted Ben&rsquo;s story</p>
<p>about Linda being kidnapped</p>
<p>is the fact that she was independent enough</p>
<p>to leave the Smiths&rsquo; house if she wanted to.</p>
<p>She was clearly the eldest</p>
<p>and most responsible of the three kids.</p>
<p>I mean, enough so that Noreen felt comfortable</p>
<p>leaving her to watch over Ben that night.</p>
<p>There was also the fact that back in 1981,</p>
<p>Pocatello, Idaho didn&rsquo;t have an extensive track record</p>
<p>of violent crimes.</p>
<p>The city is located in Southeast Idaho,</p>
<p>about two and a half hours north of Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
<p>More than half the population is Mormon.</p>
<p>And for the most part,</p>
<p>Pocatello had had a fairly low crime rate over the years.</p>
<p>Linda herself was a devout Mormon.</p>
<p>Ben says she was shy</p>
<p>and loved spending her time in the church</p>
<p>and with her school friends</p>
<p>who also shared her same beliefs.</p>
<p>Something else Linda was devoted to,</p>
<p>though it was short-lived,</p>
<p>was keeping a diary of her life.</p>
<p>Ben brought one of her journals with him</p>
<p>to his interview for this episode.</p>
<p>The pages are covered with Linda&rsquo;s writing</p>
<p>about school, her friends,</p>
<p>and boys she had crushes on at church.</p>
<p>Her first journal entry was in October of 1979.</p>
<p>She wrote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I went to church today and had a great time.</p>
<p>I met the girls in my class</p>
<p>and they treated me pretty nice.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In January, 1981, Linda wrote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I woke up about nine and Disco Duck was on.</p>
<p>And about 9.30, my little brother woke up</p>
<p>and we went roller skating.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Disco Duck.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, that&rsquo;s so funny.</p>
<p>According to the diary,</p>
<p>Linda made her last journal entry in late April of 1981,</p>
<p>less than two months before she was kidnapped.</p>
<p>She wrote that she was looking forward</p>
<p>to her 14th birthday.</p>
<p>Every page after that date is blank.</p>
<p>And 10 days before she was abducted, Linda turned 14.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s limited information out there</p>
<p>about what exactly happened in the police investigation</p>
<p>immediately after Linda was abducted on June 14th, 1981.</p>
<p>After talking with Ben on record</p>
<p>and Lori, who didn&rsquo;t want to be recorded,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t seem like police did a whole lot to find Linda</p>
<p>in those initial 48 hours of her being gone.</p>
<p>The Pocatello Police Department declined to participate</p>
<p>in an interview with us for this episode,</p>
<p>likely because Linda&rsquo;s case</p>
<p>is still considered open and active.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s what we do know.</p>
<p>In the days immediately after Linda was reported</p>
<p>as being dragged from her home and stuffed into a van,</p>
<p>police and many community members</p>
<p>just kept thinking that wasn&rsquo;t the truth</p>
<p>and were hopeful she would just turn back up.</p>
<p>Ben remembers people making up stories</p>
<p>about having seen Linda in other towns.</p>
<p>Ben even said they saw her in Las Vegas,</p>
<p>but later they admitted that was a lie.</p>
<p>Ben says the family&rsquo;s church bishop also told police</p>
<p>he thought based on everything he knew about the family,</p>
<p>it was more than likely that Linda probably ran away.</p>
<p>One week after her abduction report was taken</p>
<p>and no one except the family was really taking it seriously,</p>
<p>the entire case changed in a major way.</p>
<p>Clothing showed up and it belonged to Linda.</p>
<p>Ben found several pieces of young girl&rsquo;s clothing</p>
<p>scattered off a highway exit in Pocatello.</p>
<p>At the time, the man didn&rsquo;t know what to make of the clothing</p>
<p>and waited a day or so before he called police</p>
<p>to tell detectives about what he&rsquo;d found.</p>
<p>When police did finally get ahold of the clothing,</p>
<p>officers asked the Smith family to confirm</p>
<p>if any of the items belonged to Linda.</p>
<p>And Noreen, her mother, positively ID&rsquo;d the articles</p>
<p>as belonging to her daughter.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s bananas is that even then,</p>
<p>when the cops had Linda&rsquo;s own mother saying,</p>
<p>yes, this belonged to my daughter,</p>
<p>Ben says police in Pocatello</p>
<p>still wouldn&rsquo;t call the case a kidnapping.</p>
<p>The details are slim,</p>
<p>but I guess whatever state the clothing was in</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t make it apparent to the police</p>
<p>that something violent had happened to Linda.</p>
<p>To them, it was just clothing on the side of a highway</p>
<p>that her family said was hers.</p>
<p>So for an entire year after the clothing was found,</p>
<p>not a lot happened with the case</p>
<p>until the start of summer in 1982 when tragic news came in.</p>
<p>In May, three young girls were out playing</p>
<p>near a Pocatello subdivision called Sagewood Hills</p>
<p>when they came across several bones.</p>
<p>Now, bones in the Idaho woods</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t always cause concern right away</p>
<p>because there are large animals like bears</p>
<p>that roam that part of the country.</p>
<p>But something about these bones really stood out.</p>
<p>In the pile was the upper part</p>
<p>of what looked like a human skull.</p>
<p>The girls took the bones home</p>
<p>and showed one of their mothers</p>
<p>and that woman called the police to report the find.</p>
<p>Police quickly got out to the subdivision</p>
<p>where the girls had been playing</p>
<p>and conducted a more thorough search.</p>
<p>And you probably guessed it,</p>
<p>they found more remains scattered throughout the area.</p>
<p>The medical examiner&rsquo;s best estimate</p>
<p>was that the bones had been there</p>
<p>for several months to a year.</p>
<p>The teeth from the skull were compared to dental records</p>
<p>of recent missing people from Pocatello.</p>
<p>And eventually, police announced</p>
<p>that the partial skeleton belonged to Linda Smith.</p>
<p>Officers also found human hairs</p>
<p>and remnants of three pairs of pants with the remains.</p>
<p>Whether or not any of those pants</p>
<p>belonged to Linda is unclear.</p>
<p>And even Ben doesn&rsquo;t know that information.</p>
<p>But I have to think that since some of Linda&rsquo;s clothing</p>
<p>had already been found by the highway a few months earlier,</p>
<p>the pants probably didn&rsquo;t belong to Linda.</p>
<p>Anyway, according to reporting by the Idaho State Journal</p>
<p>at a press conference on the day police announced</p>
<p>the bones were Linda&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>the police department confirmed</p>
<p>they believed foul play was likely involved,</p>
<p>but no cause of death could be determined.</p>
<p>The bone fragments and skull that were found</p>
<p>were just too deteriorated.</p>
<p>In the ground around several spots</p>
<p>where remains were recovered,</p>
<p>police said they found bullet casings,</p>
<p>but the department made sure to note in a public statement</p>
<p>that the wooded area was a popular place</p>
<p>for target practice.</p>
<p>There was no way that they could know for sure</p>
<p>if any of those casings were relevant to Linda&rsquo;s remains</p>
<p>or a potential cause of death.</p>
<p>On the day authorities held their press conference,</p>
<p>Ben was just days away from turning 10 years old.</p>
<p>He remembers coming home from school</p>
<p>and learning the terrible news.</p>
<p>His grandpa was waiting for him in his bedroom</p>
<p>to tell him that police had finally found his big sister.</p>
<p>I remember more about that night</p>
<p>and I remember more about the day</p>
<p>that they found her remains than I can remember before.</p>
<p>Finding Linda&rsquo;s remains</p>
<p>was a big turning point in the case.</p>
<p>Finally, the Pocatello police reclassified the case</p>
<p>as a kidnapping and murder,</p>
<p>but by then it was sort of too little too late</p>
<p>to process the crime scene or collect any evidence</p>
<p>that might&rsquo;ve been left behind</p>
<p>by the suspect in the Smith&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>You see, shortly after Linda was taken,</p>
<p>Noreen, Ben and Lori moved close to Noreen&rsquo;s parents</p>
<p>in Bay Salt, Idaho.</p>
<p>They never went back to the Pocatello house after that</p>
<p>and other people moved in.</p>
<p>For Noreen and the kids,</p>
<p>the memories of Linda in that house were just too painful</p>
<p>and staying in Pocatello became unbearable.</p>
<p>So any chance that investigators</p>
<p>were going to find something useful</p>
<p>to the investigation in the old house</p>
<p>a year after Linda was kidnapped was low.</p>
<p>Today, the house is still there, but sits empty.</p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t changed much.</p>
<p>The alley is still there</p>
<p>and so is the back door where the man dragged Linda from.</p>
<p>One of our reporters, Emily,</p>
<p>actually went there in person to get images for us</p>
<p>and you can see those in the blog post for this episode</p>
<p>on our website, thedeckpodcast.com.</p>
<p>Before the abduction,</p>
<p>Ben says the Smith&rsquo;s house was never locked.</p>
<p>He says the Smith&rsquo;s had a sort of open door policy</p>
<p>for family and neighborhood friends.</p>
<p>Noreen was raising the kids as a single mother</p>
<p>and she was on welfare at the time.</p>
<p>Ben says that his mom worked really hard to make ends meet</p>
<p>and that often meant that she wasn&rsquo;t around a lot.</p>
<p>People were always coming and going from the Smith house</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t unusual for adults to come and go</p>
<p>and visit with the kids while Noreen was working.</p>
<p>As he&rsquo;s grown older, Ben has come to believe</p>
<p>the family&rsquo;s open door policy</p>
<p>may be how the suspect got in that fateful night.</p>
<p>After 40 years of always thinking about his sister&rsquo;s case,</p>
<p>Ben doesn&rsquo;t think it was a complete stranger</p>
<p>who took Linda.</p>
<p>Whoever had taken my sister,</p>
<p>I think, had been in the house before.</p>
<p>Honestly, they knew where to go to get her.</p>
<p>Honestly, that theory makes sense.</p>
<p>Statistically, a true stranger abduction is very rare,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re talking someone coming into the home.</p>
<p>But those cases do happen.</p>
<p>And while I agree with Ben</p>
<p>and think her abductor had some familiarity with the family,</p>
<p>you might disagree when you learn that Linda Smith</p>
<p>was not the only young girl to be kidnapped and killed</p>
<p>in Southeast Idaho in the early 1980s.</p>
<p>We had one of our investigators do a little digging</p>
<p>to gather more information about the greater Pocatello area</p>
<p>around the time of Linda Smith&rsquo;s abduction and murder.</p>
<p>According to several Pocatello news outlets,</p>
<p>Linda Smith&rsquo;s bones were actually one of three sets</p>
<p>of remains found in Southeast Idaho</p>
<p>during the span of just seven months in 1982.</p>
<p>The other sets belonged to two young girls</p>
<p>who went missing in the mid-1970s</p>
<p>from other towns in the area several years before Linda.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t a whole lot of information out there</p>
<p>on those cases,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s some general information we did find out.</p>
<p>Disappearances of preteen girls from Southeastern Idaho</p>
<p>started happening in 1975,</p>
<p>when 12-year-old Lynette Culver vanished</p>
<p>after leaving Alameda Junior High in Pocatello.</p>
<p>Three years later, in 1978, 12-year-old Tina Anderson</p>
<p>and 15-year-old Patricia Campbell went missing</p>
<p>after attending a Pioneer Day celebration at Alameda Park,</p>
<p>just a mile from the school.</p>
<p>Police later said the other two sets of remains</p>
<p>found near Linda&rsquo;s belonged to Tina and Patricia.</p>
<p>Then we know Linda Smith is abducted from her home</p>
<p>and likely killed shortly after that in 1981 in Pocatello.</p>
<p>The last girl to go missing was 14-year-old Cindy Brighurst,</p>
<p>who was abducted in 1983 while babysitting</p>
<p>a two-year-old at their family home.</p>
<p>In that case, Cindy vanished,</p>
<p>and the baby she was watching was left unharmed,</p>
<p>just like Ben.</p>
<p>Cindy&rsquo;s body was found south of Pocatello</p>
<p>a month after she vanished.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s five cases of preteen or teenage girls</p>
<p>in the span of eight years who all vanished</p>
<p>or were reported missing from similar areas</p>
<p>in towns very close to one another in Southeast Idaho.</p>
<p>Despite most of the girls having gone</p>
<p>to the same junior high school in the same town,</p>
<p>police have never been able to say</p>
<p>if the cases are connected.</p>
<p>Even more bizarre is that in 1989,</p>
<p>one of the most notorious serial killers</p>
<p>in American history confessed to committing</p>
<p>one of the Pocatello murders.</p>
<p>Just before he was executed,</p>
<p>Ted Bundy told police he abducted the first girl,</p>
<p>Lynette Culver, near Alameda Junior High School.</p>
<p>He said he took her to a local hotel,</p>
<p>drowned her in the bathtub,</p>
<p>and threw her body in the nearby Snake River.</p>
<p>According to reporting by the Idaho State Journal,</p>
<p>former Idaho Attorney General Jim Jones</p>
<p>said Bundy knew personal details about Lynette&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>that only she would know.</p>
<p>So he believed Bundy&rsquo;s confession.</p>
<p>But Lynette&rsquo;s body has never been found.</p>
<p>As a lot of you probably know,</p>
<p>Ted Bundy was proven to have committed several murders</p>
<p>throughout the American West in the mid and late 70s.</p>
<p>He was eventually arrested and locked up officially by 1978.</p>
<p>So because we know he was in prison by 1978,</p>
<p>Ted Bundy couldn&rsquo;t have killed Linda,</p>
<p>Tina, Patricia, or Cindy.</p>
<p>So the question becomes,</p>
<p>did Pocatello, Idaho have more than one serial killer</p>
<p>roaming the streets targeting young girls?</p>
<p>I think the answer is probably yes.</p>
<p>Our team tried for weeks to get in touch</p>
<p>with the Pocatello Police Department</p>
<p>to figure out if all of these years later</p>
<p>detectives have made any connections</p>
<p>between the cases, but they were uncooperative.</p>
<p>A public information officer told our investigator</p>
<p>that he would ask a detective</p>
<p>if he wanted to at least talk about Linda&rsquo;s case</p>
<p>and where it stands now,</p>
<p>but the department never called back.</p>
<p>Ben said there&rsquo;s been a revolving door of detectives</p>
<p>assigned to Linda&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>He can name at least six different detectives</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve worked on it over the last 40 years.</p>
<p>In 2007, he said the department</p>
<p>took another look at the case,</p>
<p>and that at the time they told him</p>
<p>they had at least two people of interest,</p>
<p>but nothing came of that information.</p>
<p>And here we are in it&rsquo;s 2022 with nothing new.</p>
<p>Ben&rsquo;s not sure who is working on Leeds today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still considered an open case,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s cold, it&rsquo;s cold as hell,</p>
<p>but they won&rsquo;t investigate it anymore.</p>
<p>Now that he&rsquo;s pushing 50 years old,</p>
<p>Ben has tried to move on from the police</p>
<p>accusing him of lying when he was a child.</p>
<p>Over the decades,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s continued to cooperate with investigators</p>
<p>and even gone back in a few times for interviews</p>
<p>and to look through photo lineups.</p>
<p>He says the one thing he&rsquo;ll never get over</p>
<p>is the fact that his sister might still be alive today</p>
<p>if only those two responding police officers in June 1981</p>
<p>had believed him when he said Linda was abducted.</p>
<p>When I turned 26,</p>
<p>I had a full mental breakdown because of everything.</p>
<p>I had all the guilt,</p>
<p>I had all the, you know,</p>
<p>from not being able to do more to save my sister.</p>
<p>To this day, Ben struggles to remember</p>
<p>exactly what Linda&rsquo;s face looks like,</p>
<p>and he has a hard time remembering the sound of her voice.</p>
<p>Time has faded so much of his memory.</p>
<p>Different rumors circulated over the years</p>
<p>about who killed Linda,</p>
<p>and Ben says those are hard to listen to.</p>
<p>For a while, the family sort of suspected an 18-year-old</p>
<p>who&rsquo;d taken a liking to Linda</p>
<p>during her time working a paper route.</p>
<p>They thought he could have been involved.</p>
<p>Apparently, this guy would write Linda letters,</p>
<p>but Linda never reciprocated the feelings,</p>
<p>and as far as Ben knows,</p>
<p>that man had never been to their house in 1981.</p>
<p>Knowing the Smith home at that time, Ben thinks is critical.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s certain Linda&rsquo;s kidnapper</p>
<p>knew his way around their house</p>
<p>and knew to park his van in the alleyway</p>
<p>that led right up to the back door.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no indication from our research material</p>
<p>or discussions with Lori or Ben</p>
<p>that the mystery older guy who wrote letters to Linda</p>
<p>was ever questioned by police.</p>
<p>Law enforcement isn&rsquo;t an open book on this case,</p>
<p>so who knows exactly who they spoke to or didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Ben says at one point, the police suggested Noreen,</p>
<p>their mother, might have known something or been involved,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s never believed that.</p>
<p>What he said was,</p>
<p>do I think my mom,</p>
<p>is it possible that my mom was lured away that night</p>
<p>so that my sister could be taken?</p>
<p>What I heard was, do you think your mom&rsquo;s involved?</p>
<p>The popular theory on this whole situation is,</p>
<p>they think that my mom might have known something</p>
<p>about somebody,</p>
<p>and they killed my sister to shut my mom up.</p>
<p>Noreen died in 2000 and is buried right next to Linda</p>
<p>at a cemetery in Idaho Falls.</p>
<p>Ben says she lived her life feeling guilty</p>
<p>for not being home the night Linda was kidnapped,</p>
<p>not because she had anything to do with what happened.</p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t really been resolved</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re still just waiting for something to happen</p>
<p>and I think I will go to our graves</p>
<p>and wait for something to happen like my mom did.</p>
<p>When I see or hear about a missing person,</p>
<p>missing child, when it&rsquo;s even ran away,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hopeful that they get some sort of quick closure</p>
<p>to whatever is going on in their lives.</p>
<p>Before her death, Noreen told local reporters</p>
<p>at a news conference that she wasn&rsquo;t sure,</p>
<p>even if she was home that night,</p>
<p>that it would have mattered.</p>
<p>She was quoted as saying that whoever snuck</p>
<p>into the family&rsquo;s house was there to get Linda</p>
<p>and they were going to do whatever it took.</p>
<p>Ben says going all these years</p>
<p>not knowing exactly how his sister died</p>
<p>has been hard to bear.</p>
<p>He hopes that whatever happened</p>
<p>after she was shoved into that van in the alley</p>
<p>was swift and painless.</p>
<p>We tend to think of her death as,</p>
<p>the date of her death as being that night.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no way for sure to know,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;d rather think of her not suffering.</p>
<p>Ben says he&rsquo;ll always miss Linda</p>
<p>and he remembers her as a mama&rsquo;s girl.</p>
<p>Growing up, if he or Lori wanted to stay the night</p>
<p>at their grandparents&rsquo; house,</p>
<p>Linda always wanted to stay home with Noreen.</p>
<p>A neighbor told the Idaho State Journal in 1982</p>
<p>that she remembered Linda as a polite, quiet girl.</p>
<p>And she often saw her and Noreen</p>
<p>sitting in their front yard in lawn chairs,</p>
<p>chatting like girlfriends.</p>
<p>Now Noreen and Linda are resting right next to each other</p>
<p>in a spot where Ben and Lori can visit their grave sites.</p>
<p>Seeing his sister&rsquo;s face on a deck of playing cards</p>
<p>that gets passed out to inmates and in the community</p>
<p>to hopefully generate new leads is encouraging to Ben.</p>
<p>The fact that Linda was assigned</p>
<p>to be the nine of hearts in the deck</p>
<p>strikes him as especially meaningful.</p>
<p>I looked at it and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>oh, the nine of hearts, that&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>
<p>I was nine when it happened and I love my sister.</p>
<p>To see that, I bawled.</p>
<p>Ben and his younger sister, Lori,</p>
<p>have both watched over the years</p>
<p>as other cold cases in Idaho have been solved.</p>
<p>He hopes one day he&rsquo;ll get to know what closure feels like</p>
<p>before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s more of now prevalent</p>
<p>because I sit there and I watch</p>
<p>all these other cases get solved.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m happy for the families, don&rsquo;t get me wrong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy for the families.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m thinking all this time, when&rsquo;s it gonna be our turn?</p>
<p>If Amanda is still alive, that&rsquo;s a hard one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a difficult question.</p>
<p>Accountability, honestly.</p>
<p>If you did it, come forward.</p>
<p>If you know who did it, come forward.</p>
<p>Let us have a chance for our families.</p>
<p>Give us the chance to have closure too.</p>
