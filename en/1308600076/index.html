    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Dr. Paul Conte.</p>
<p>Dr. Conte is a psychiatrist who did his training</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine,</p>
<p>and then went on to be chief resident</p>
<p>at Harvard Medical School.</p>
<p>He now runs the Pacific Premier Group,</p>
<p>which is a collection of psychiatrists and therapists</p>
<p>focusing on solving complex human problems,</p>
<p>including trauma, addiction,</p>
<p>personality, and psychiatric disorders.</p>
<p>Today, we discuss trauma in detail</p>
<p>and the therapeutic process in detail.</p>
<p>For instance, we discuss what is trauma?</p>
<p>How do you know if you have trauma?</p>
<p>Dr. Conte shares with us, for instance,</p>
<p>that not every experience that we think is traumatic</p>
<p>is necessarily traumatic,</p>
<p>and yet many people might have trauma</p>
<p>without even realizing it.</p>
<p>We also talk about the therapeutic process generally.</p>
<p>For instance, how to pick a therapist,</p>
<p>how to best approach and go through therapy,</p>
<p>and how to evaluate whether or not therapy</p>
<p>and your relationship to the therapist is working or not.</p>
<p>We also talk about self-therapies</p>
<p>because we acknowledge that not everyone has access to</p>
<p>or can afford therapy.</p>
<p>And we talk about drug therapies.</p>
<p>For instance, antidepressants, antipsychotics.</p>
<p>We talk about alcohol, cannabis, ketamine,</p>
<p>and the psychedelics, including psilocybin, LSD.</p>
<p>And we talk about the clinical use of MDMA</p>
<p>and what the future of that looks like.</p>
<p>The reason for bringing Dr. Conte onto this podcast</p>
<p>is because I see him as the person who has the greatest</p>
<p>and most holistic view of therapy, trauma, drug therapies,</p>
<p>talk therapies, and how self-therapy</p>
<p>and work with others can be integrated</p>
<p>for both healing and growing from difficult circumstances.</p>
<p>Dr. Conte is also the author of an exceptional book</p>
<p>entitled, Trauma, The Invisible Epidemic,</p>
<p>how trauma works and how we can heal from it.</p>
<p>That book describes trauma and its many features</p>
<p>and many tools, some of which we discuss</p>
<p>on the podcast today.</p>
<p>So whether or not you have trauma or not,</p>
<p>by the end of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>you will have a much deeper understanding</p>
<p>about what trauma is.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m confident that you will gain insight</p>
<p>into whether or not you have trauma or not,</p>
<p>whether or not people close to you have trauma or not,</p>
<p>and the various paths to recovering</p>
<p>and indeed growing from trauma that we can all take.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;ll soon learn, Dr. Conte is an exceptional</p>
<p>communicator and has a unique window</p>
<p>into the trauma and therapeutic process</p>
<p>that I know that all of us can benefit from.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects of our brain</p>
<p>and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3</p>
<p>and K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need</p>
<p>and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally,</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now for my discussion with Dr. Paul Conte.</p>
<p>Paul, thank you so much for being here today.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to this,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve received a ton of questions about trauma,</p>
<p>about therapy, about how to assess where one is</p>
<p>in their own arc of problems,</p>
<p>and addressing familial issues,</p>
<p>and relationship issues, and so forth.</p>
<p>If we could just start off very basic</p>
<p>and just get everyone oriented.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>How should we define trauma?</p>
<p>We all have hard experiences.</p>
<p>Some of them we might ruminate on more than others,</p>
<p>but what is trauma?</p>
<p>I think to make the definition relevant,</p>
<p>I think we have to look at trauma</p>
<p>as not anything negative that happens to us, right?</p>
<p>But something that overwhelms our coping skills,</p>
<p>and then leaves us different as we move forward.</p>
<p>So it changes the way that our brains function, right?</p>
<p>And then that change is evident in us</p>
<p>as we move forward through life.</p>
<p>So how do we know if we have trauma or not?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard before, everyone has trauma.</p>
<p>For instance, I&rsquo;ve heard that if we are a child,</p>
<p>or when we are a child and we request love from a parent,</p>
<p>or attention from a parent, if they dismiss us,</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s a microtrauma.</p>
<p>Is that overstating or unfair to the real issue of trauma?</p>
<p>Do we all have trauma?</p>
<p>What are microtraumas?</p>
<p>What are macrotraumas?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I think traumas that we might categorize</p>
<p>as disappointments, right?</p>
<p>Or things that are negative, but not deeply impactful,</p>
<p>I think is not a helpful definition, right?</p>
<p>I think the helpful definition is something</p>
<p>that rises to the magnitude of really changing us.</p>
<p>And something that we can see both in how we behave,</p>
<p>we can see it in mood, anxiety, behavior, sleep,</p>
<p>physical health.</p>
<p>So we can identify it,</p>
<p>and we can also see it in brain changes.</p>
<p>So the fact that we become say more hypervigilant, right?</p>
<p>More vigilant, and then we can see</p>
<p>that different parts of the brain are more active.</p>
<p>So that definition,</p>
<p>that definition captures how trauma,</p>
<p>if it rises to a certain level,</p>
<p>like what we would say trauma</p>
<p>that makes a post-trauma syndrome, right?</p>
<p>Leaves us different,</p>
<p>I think is the helpful definition of trauma</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a clinical definition, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s changes in us as people.</p>
<p>And we can map those changes</p>
<p>to identifiable shifts in our brain function.</p>
<p>So how do we know if we&rsquo;ve been changed by something?</p>
<p>I mean, I can think back to childhood events</p>
<p>where some kid on the playground or in the classroom</p>
<p>said something I didn&rsquo;t like, something negative about me.</p>
<p>I think most people can do that.</p>
<p>We have a great memory for the kid</p>
<p>that said something awful,</p>
<p>or the parent or teacher that said something awful</p>
<p>that really felt like it hurt us</p>
<p>or at least it stuck with us.</p>
<p>So clearly one&rsquo;s brain, my brain in this example</p>
<p>has been changed by that event such that I remember it.</p>
<p>But how do we know if something</p>
<p>has actually changed the way that we are?</p>
<p>Because of course we don&rsquo;t know how we would be otherwise.</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s difficult, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s doable, but it&rsquo;s difficult because the response.</p>
<p>So if the trauma rises to the level of changing our brains,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t just mean like we have a new memory, right?</p>
<p>So we can have memories of something</p>
<p>that was negative, right?</p>
<p>And in that sense, it changes the brain</p>
<p>because now there&rsquo;s something we can call to mind,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t change the functioning of the brain, right?</p>
<p>If trauma rises to the level of changing the functioning</p>
<p>of our brains, then there&rsquo;s almost always a reflex</p>
<p>of guilt and shame around the trauma that can lead us,</p>
<p>it often leads us to bury it, right?</p>
<p>To avoid it, right?</p>
<p>To feel that now there&rsquo;s something negative inside of me</p>
<p>and it feels shameful,</p>
<p>or it feels like no one else would accept it, right?</p>
<p>So what happens is people tend to avoid looking</p>
<p>at the change in them, which is exactly the opposite</p>
<p>of what needs to be done, right?</p>
<p>The idea of in a viral pandemic, right?</p>
<p>We wanna stay away from one another and isolate, right?</p>
<p>But with the trauma epidemic,</p>
<p>we need to communicate with other people.</p>
<p>We need to communicate and put words</p>
<p>to what&rsquo;s going on inside of us.</p>
<p>And very often a person knows,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve done so much clinical work</p>
<p>over about 20 years that has focused on trauma.</p>
<p>And a lot of the times the person knows, right?</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re not admitting it to themselves</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re afraid of it, right?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>But if they start talking,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;ll talk about the event or the situation.</p>
<p>It could be something acute,</p>
<p>or it could be something chronic</p>
<p>that really has been harmful to them, right?</p>
<p>And then they feel different afterwards.</p>
<p>Oh, after that, I started thinking differently,</p>
<p>feeling differently, but that doesn&rsquo;t always happen.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s a process of exploration through dialogue,</p>
<p>right, whether it&rsquo;s written or whether it&rsquo;s spoken</p>
<p>of the person sort of exploring</p>
<p>the changes inside of themselves,</p>
<p>maybe changes to their self-talk inside,</p>
<p>changes to their thoughts about the world</p>
<p>and whether they can navigate safely and readily in it.</p>
<p>And it anchors, as I talk about this,</p>
<p>the example I&rsquo;ll use at times</p>
<p>the example of my own life,</p>
<p>where when I was much younger in my early 20s,</p>
<p>my younger brother took his life by suicide.</p>
<p>And the response of guilt and shame</p>
<p>and hiding all of it inside of me was,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very dramatic, but I wasn&rsquo;t acknowledging it, right?</p>
<p>Because I didn&rsquo;t know what to do about it.</p>
<p>And I felt guilty and I felt responsible and I felt ashamed.</p>
<p>So there was an avoidance inside of me.</p>
<p>And then I wasn&rsquo;t saying to myself,</p>
<p>hey, before this, you thought that you could be effective</p>
<p>and you could make your way in the world.</p>
<p>And if you were a good person and you worked hard,</p>
<p>you could make a difference, right?</p>
<p>And then afterwards I thought, I can&rsquo;t get anywhere.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s against me.</p>
<p>And I felt like, oh, my options are all gone.</p>
<p>And I was like 24 years old, right?</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t see that the change was in me,</p>
<p>but I was taking care of myself poorly.</p>
<p>Like there was enough going on that was unhealthy</p>
<p>that I couldn&rsquo;t avoid the realization that like,</p>
<p>hey, I&rsquo;m different now.</p>
<p>And in these ways that are automatic,</p>
<p>my reflex to, can I make my way in the world?</p>
<p>Can I have a good life?</p>
<p>Can I be happy?</p>
<p>Well, my reflexes to that were all different.</p>
<p>And they were coming through the lens of heightened anxiety,</p>
<p>heightened vigilance, a sense of guilt, a sense of shame,</p>
<p>and a sense of non-belonging in the world.</p>
<p>And was ultimately good and helpful people around me</p>
<p>and my own realization and hey,</p>
<p>things are not going well, right?</p>
<p>That led me to then get some help</p>
<p>and to be able to talk about it and realize like,</p>
<p>oh my gosh, I need to face these things</p>
<p>that are going on inside of me.</p>
<p>From a psychoanalytic, psychological,</p>
<p>and maybe even a neuroscience perspective, two questions.</p>
<p>Why do you think that when we experience trauma,</p>
<p>these things that we call guilt and shame surface,</p>
<p>you know, everything you&rsquo;re telling me is that</p>
<p>in the end, that&rsquo;s not adaptive.</p>
<p>Why would we be built that way?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first question.</p>
<p>And then the second question is,</p>
<p>how should we conceptualize guilt and shame?</p>
<p>You know, I think we hear guilt, we hear shame,</p>
<p>how should we think about it?</p>
<p>I mean, those emotions must exist in us for some reason.</p>
<p>But in this case, it seems like they don&rsquo;t serve us well.</p>
<p>So maybe in that order or in reverse order,</p>
<p>you know, what is guilt really?</p>
<p>What is shame really?</p>
<p>And why is it that we seem to be reflexively wired</p>
<p>to feel guilty and feel ashamed</p>
<p>when that&rsquo;s the exact opposite of what we need to do</p>
<p>in the case of trauma?</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>No, I think these are great questions.</p>
<p>And I mean, I don&rsquo;t think anyone knows the answers for sure,</p>
<p>but my read of all of that is that there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>adaptive that has happened in us through evolution</p>
<p>that now becomes maladaptive</p>
<p>in the way we live in the modern world, right?</p>
<p>So if you think of through most of human development,</p>
<p>you know, people weren&rsquo;t living that long, right?</p>
<p>And the idea was to survive and reproduce.</p>
<p>So traumatic things that happened to us,</p>
<p>it would make sense for them to stay with us, right?</p>
<p>So, you know, if you ate a new food</p>
<p>and got really, really sick,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, you better remember that, right?</p>
<p>You know, if you see someone from the group of people,</p>
<p>you know, a couple miles away, right?</p>
<p>And one of those people attacks you, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you better remember that.</p>
<p>So the traumatic things that are sort of emblazoned</p>
<p>in our brain are built to last, right?</p>
<p>Things that are positive will generate</p>
<p>some emotion inside of us,</p>
<p>but things that are profoundly negative</p>
<p>are much more likely to stay with us.</p>
<p>And I think that that was adaptive, right?</p>
<p>When all of that was about survival, right?</p>
<p>And I think the same thing is true with, say, shame, right?</p>
<p>So I think here it makes sense to talk a little bit,</p>
<p>and actually I&rsquo;m interested if your thoughts about this,</p>
<p>right, that the limbic system, right?</p>
<p>So the system often is called the emotion system, right?</p>
<p>In our brains has actually, of course, varying function,</p>
<p>right, and one aspect is affect, right?</p>
<p>So affect is aroused in us,</p>
<p>which the meaning then is it&rsquo;s created in us</p>
<p>without our choice, right?</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re walking down the road</p>
<p>and someone jumps in front of us or pushes us, right?</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s a response of fear, anger, right?</p>
<p>Heart starts beating faster, more blood to the muscles.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting ready to fight, right, or run, right?</p>
<p>And then we become aware of it, right?</p>
<p>So the aroused affect in us is also about survival,</p>
<p>and it has a very deep impact upon us,</p>
<p>and shame is an aroused affect.</p>
<p>So it can be raised in us without our choice,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very powerful, which if you think about that</p>
<p>is an extremely strong deterrent, right?</p>
<p>So if you had, you know, imagine a tribe</p>
<p>or a group of people, right, that are sheltered together,</p>
<p>and, you know, someone eats half the food at night</p>
<p>or something, right?</p>
<p>And like, there&rsquo;s a very negative response, right?</p>
<p>And that person feels shame because shame is so powerful</p>
<p>to control behavior, right?</p>
<p>So the way that trauma can change our brains</p>
<p>and stay with us in a way that says, be more vigilant,</p>
<p>look at the world in a different way,</p>
<p>act more defensively, right?</p>
<p>And how that links to shame and to guilt.</p>
<p>So then guilt becomes what gets called feeling technically,</p>
<p>where we relate the aroused affect to ourselves, right?</p>
<p>So shame, the aroused affect, and guilt, the next step,</p>
<p>right, when the shame gets related to self,</p>
<p>are such profound behavioral interventions and deterrents,</p>
<p>right, that you can see, I think, how evolutionarily</p>
<p>kind of all makes sense.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re fighting for survival, you know,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re an elder statesman, if we make it to 20, right,</p>
<p>this makes sense, but it doesn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>in a world where we live much longer, right?</p>
<p>We navigate in all sorts of different ways,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s so much coming at us that can be traumatizing.</p>
<p>I mean, if you think about the news, right,</p>
<p>I mean, how many times have I written a prescription</p>
<p>for someone that says, no more news, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve actually written those prescriptions?</p>
<p>Oh, yes, yes.</p>
<p>So glance at the news, like look at the news for news.</p>
<p>Anything going on I need to know, right?</p>
<p>But what are people doing is they&rsquo;re looking at it</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re clicking and they&rsquo;re clicking,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a sense of being like enthralled</p>
<p>in a very frightening way with the horrors</p>
<p>that are in front of us.</p>
<p>And it shows how, yes, trauma can come through</p>
<p>acute things that happen to us.</p>
<p>Trauma can come through chronic things,</p>
<p>chronic denigration, whether it&rsquo;s based upon</p>
<p>socioeconomic status, immigrant immigration status,</p>
<p>race, religion, sexuality, gender identity,</p>
<p>these chronic traumas, right,</p>
<p>of being denigrated by the society around us</p>
<p>or treated as less than can change the brain,</p>
<p>but vicarious experiences can too, right?</p>
<p>And we know this is not theoretical.</p>
<p>We know that the changes in the brain</p>
<p>can come from vicarious experiences too,</p>
<p>which is why people who are glued to the news</p>
<p>and then feeling like, oh my goodness,</p>
<p>like what is happening?</p>
<p>You know, the mothers in the Ukraine</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve lost babies in the war,</p>
<p>and like there are things that are so terrifying</p>
<p>that if we spend so much time with that,</p>
<p>it has a similar effect.</p>
<p>So our brains are built to change from trauma,</p>
<p>but not in the way we experience trauma</p>
<p>and not in the way that we live life</p>
<p>in terms of the nature of living life</p>
<p>and the duration of life in the modern world,</p>
<p>where these traumas that happen to us</p>
<p>are often so bad for us</p>
<p>because they change how our brain is functioning</p>
<p>and then our entire orientation to the world is different.</p>
<p>And that could be for, you know,</p>
<p>years and years and decades and decades.</p>
<p>It brings so much misery and suffering,</p>
<p>and at times it brings death.</p>
<p>If you think about 100,000 overdose deaths</p>
<p>in this country in a year, 100,000.</p>
<p>I mean, where is so much of that arising from?</p>
<p>As a person who&rsquo;s treated addiction</p>
<p>very intensively over many years,</p>
<p>I think that, well, I feel sure that the majority</p>
<p>of addiction that I see and treat</p>
<p>arises ultimately the roots of it are in trauma</p>
<p>and are in trying to soothe something that&rsquo;s stuck inside</p>
<p>that the person isn&rsquo;t letting outside</p>
<p>because of the guilt and shame,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s running around in their head</p>
<p>and is tormented by it.</p>
<p>And now there&rsquo;s a pull for these drugs</p>
<p>or sometimes medicines to soothe.</p>
<p>So, you know, the opiates that were given</p>
<p>after a minor surgery, right,</p>
<p>are like, okay, yeah, they help the pain</p>
<p>from the minor surgery,</p>
<p>but what they&rsquo;re really helping is the pain inside, right?</p>
<p>But that very quickly turns into addiction, danger, risk.</p>
<p>And we see that over and over again,</p>
<p>and not in a theoretical way.</p>
<p>I see that in people who have been in my practice</p>
<p>with addiction arising from trauma</p>
<p>who have subsequently died.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sort of writ large in our existence</p>
<p>in the modern world.</p>
<p>Incredible to me that this is the way it works.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is this idea</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve heard about before,</p>
<p>I think it was a Freudian concept</p>
<p>of a repetition compulsion,</p>
<p>that this is what boggles my mind</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m hearing this.</p>
<p>Something happens to us or we observe something traumatic.</p>
<p>And instead of acknowledging that</p>
<p>and trying to distance from it,</p>
<p>there seems to be a reflex of shame and guilt in many cases</p>
<p>and stuffing it away.</p>
<p>And then a repetition of behaviors</p>
<p>to continue to try and to stuff it away.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re trying to pack, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>recently I was packing a home</p>
<p>and trying to get a sleeping bag back into the bag.</p>
<p>It seems like it&rsquo;s always on a mushroom out the top,</p>
<p>this kind of thing.</p>
<p>It takes a lot of ongoing effort.</p>
<p>And at the same time,</p>
<p>that if this thing really exists,</p>
<p>this repetition compulsion,</p>
<p>people will return over and over again</p>
<p>to the kinds of scenarios</p>
<p>or at least the kinds of emotional states</p>
<p>that look just like the trauma</p>
<p>or resemble it in some way.</p>
<p>So the question I have for you is,</p>
<p>is the repetition compulsion a real thing?</p>
<p>And why would we be wired that way?</p>
<p>My understanding of this concept</p>
<p>of the repetition compulsion</p>
<p>is that we all want to solve our traumas</p>
<p>and it allows us to put ourselves into micro</p>
<p>or again, macro versions of that over and over again.</p>
<p>We get to run the experiment again and again</p>
<p>in an attempt to solve it.</p>
<p>In the case of taking a drug that it&rsquo;s clear,</p>
<p>certain drugs like opioids,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s clear how that would not allow us to deal with it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just masking the emotional state.</p>
<p>But why is it, for instance,</p>
<p>that somebody who experiences sexual trauma</p>
<p>then places themselves into circumstances</p>
<p>of more sexual trauma?</p>
<p>Why is it that somebody who is in an abusive relationship</p>
<p>goes on to have a second and third or fourth</p>
<p>verbally or physically abusive relationship?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, on the face of it,</p>
<p>you just go, that makes no sense.</p>
<p>And yet we see this over and over and over again.</p>
<p>Yes, the first thing I would say</p>
<p>about the validity of the repetition compulsion concept</p>
<p>is a strong yes.</p>
<p>Like, yes, we see that over and over.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not necessarily in everyone,</p>
<p>but boy, it is in a lot of people who have suffered trauma.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a very good reason.</p>
<p>On the surface of it, it&rsquo;s like, it makes no sense.</p>
<p>But then if we think, well,</p>
<p>how does our brains actually function, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re sort of trained, at least in Western society, I think,</p>
<p>to think of ourselves as logical creatures, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re logical, and ultimately everything in us</p>
<p>can just boil down to logic.</p>
<p>And if we think about it enough,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna understand how to make the right decisions,</p>
<p>which is completely not true, right?</p>
<p>The limbic system, the emotion system, so to speak,</p>
<p>inside of us always trumps logic, right?</p>
<p>If you think about, does it ever make sense</p>
<p>to run into a burning building?</p>
<p>I mean, logic says no, right?</p>
<p>But if someone you love is in the burning building,</p>
<p>people run right in, right?</p>
<p>Because the limbic system says yes.</p>
<p>So when logic and emotion come head to head,</p>
<p>emotion wins all the time.</p>
<p>If emotion is powerful enough, it will always win.</p>
<p>And so the limbic system is so important.</p>
<p>And the limbic system does not care</p>
<p>about the clock or the calendar, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the answer.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll sort of say why, to the repetition compulsion.</p>
<p>So the limbic system doesn&rsquo;t know like, oh, it&rsquo;s now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s today, it&rsquo;s May, it&rsquo;s 2022.</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t care at all, right?</p>
<p>So how I would relate that to the repetition compulsion</p>
<p>is when people are repeating,</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re trying to do is to make things right, right?</p>
<p>With the idea that if we can repeat the situation</p>
<p>and make it right, it will fix everything, right?</p>
<p>Which makes perfect sense if we think,</p>
<p>well, where is that concept coming from, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s coming from the emotional part of the brain</p>
<p>that wants relief from suffering of the trauma</p>
<p>and does not understand the clock or the calendar.</p>
<p>So if I can solve something now,</p>
<p>I will also solve something in the past, right?</p>
<p>Which is why I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve sat with someone and said,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re starting to do therapy, right?</p>
<p>And the person will say, gosh, like I know,</p>
<p>look, you just can&rsquo;t help me, right?</p>
<p>I mean, my last seven relationships have been abusive, right?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll say back something sometimes like,</p>
<p>if you tell me that you&rsquo;ve had seven relationships</p>
<p>that have been abusive in different ways,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll agree with you.</p>
<p>Like, I only say that</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s never what someone says, right?</p>
<p>But I think what you&rsquo;re going to tell me is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve kind of had the same relationship seven times.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not seven things, it&rsquo;s one, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s always, I don&rsquo;t think one time yet</p>
<p>that has failed to be the case.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how, so if you think about it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how we start to elucidate what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>So the light bulb that goes off,</p>
<p>like I have not had seven different abusive relationships.</p>
<p>I have had one that I&rsquo;ve repeated seven times.</p>
<p>And now we start getting to what&rsquo;s really going on</p>
<p>and what needs to happen.</p>
<p>That person needs to face what happened</p>
<p>in that original abusive relationship.</p>
<p>And it always comes down to the same sort of concepts</p>
<p>of the person feeling terrified</p>
<p>while the abuse was going on,</p>
<p>feeling guilty, feeling ashamed,</p>
<p>feeling like, oh, they brought it on themselves.</p>
<p>They deserve it.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t deserve anything better, right?</p>
<p>Because the brain is trying to make sense of it, right?</p>
<p>Or I thought I could make that okay, but I couldn&rsquo;t, right?</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s more guilt and more shame.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s stuck inside of someone,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s bundled up inside of someone,</p>
<p>you know, like a medical abscess inside a person,</p>
<p>you know, a walled off infection inside the body,</p>
<p>this is the same concept in the brain.</p>
<p>Then of course the limbic system is going to want to fix that</p>
<p>and it fixes it by trying to let&rsquo;s recreate that situation</p>
<p>and make it right this time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I mean, it&rsquo;s, I think that one</p>
<p>of the best examples of how the right approach</p>
<p>of how like, let&rsquo;s look at that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about that, right?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s really going on there.</p>
<p>Wait, who should feel guilty and ashamed?</p>
<p>Is it the person who was abused</p>
<p>or the person who was abusing, right?</p>
<p>And we can get at what&rsquo;s going on inside the person.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what changes that.</p>
<p>And then the eighth relationship can be entirely different</p>
<p>than the first seven, right?</p>
<p>And I see that all the time.</p>
<p>I mean, this isn&rsquo;t esoteric or soft.</p>
<p>I see that play out clinically over and over again.</p>
<p>And why do things get better?</p>
<p>Because we go to the trauma and we unlock it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not hidden inside where it can control things, right?</p>
<p>We bring it to the surface</p>
<p>and then we can take away its power.</p>
<p>I keep hearing in this narrative</p>
<p>that so much of our reflexive response to trauma,</p>
<p>both emotional and the repetition compulsion</p>
<p>in terms of behaviors,</p>
<p>is about some very deep attempt to change the past.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And in fact, in an offline conversation,</p>
<p>I recall you saying something about this,</p>
<p>that the number of behaviors and thoughts</p>
<p>and avoidance of behaviors and avoidance of thoughts</p>
<p>that human beings put in to try and change the past</p>
<p>is remarkable and eerie and maladaptive,</p>
<p>it sounds like.</p>
<p>And that really stuck with me</p>
<p>because I think we all want to feel</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re in control of our future</p>
<p>and how we feel in the moment.</p>
<p>And to some extent, it works for a brief while.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this thing that happened</p>
<p>and it just evokes some internal arousal</p>
<p>and then you have to know what to do with that arousal.</p>
<p>And I think for many people, including myself,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this fundamental question,</p>
<p>okay, the thought about the thing, the event,</p>
<p>or events, plural, evokes this arousal,</p>
<p>this internal state,</p>
<p>makes some people feel sleepy and exhausted,</p>
<p>other people feel really anxious,</p>
<p>other people feel angry.</p>
<p>I mean, that arousal has all these different dimensions</p>
<p>as you know.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this question of what to do with it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d love to hear a,</p>
<p>maybe even just a top contour prescriptive</p>
<p>of what does one do?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll even just put myself in it.</p>
<p>What do I do?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m feeling upset about something.</p>
<p>I feel like my options are healthy catharsis.</p>
<p>I can tell the story, feel it.</p>
<p>I can pack it down.</p>
<p>We hear that it&rsquo;s bad to pack it down,</p>
<p>but of course one has to be functional in life</p>
<p>and deal with things.</p>
<p>And we have responsibilities at work</p>
<p>and relational responsibilities, et cetera.</p>
<p>We need to sleep at night.</p>
<p>So catharsis, healthy catharsis,</p>
<p>packing it down at the other extreme,</p>
<p>telling the story.</p>
<p>And yet I think a lot of people are afraid to tell the story</p>
<p>because in that telling,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s perhaps a re-emergence of the arousal.</p>
<p>The arousal can become greater.</p>
<p>I mean, is that what people mean when they say</p>
<p>things are going to get worse before they get better?</p>
<p>I mean, so I guess the simple version</p>
<p>of this long-winded question is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s clear we need to confront these things.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t change the past by a reflexive response</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t going to do that efficiently.</p>
<p>And so how do we deal with arousal?</p>
<p>How does one take what they feel inside</p>
<p>about something shameful,</p>
<p>what do you do with it in a moment?</p>
<p>And does that have to be done</p>
<p>in the presence of a skilled trained therapist</p>
<p>or as I&rsquo;m driving to work in the morning</p>
<p>and something comes up,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t deal with this right now, comes to mind,</p>
<p>what do I do?</p>
<p>Do I deal with it right then?</p>
<p>I know this is a big multi-dimensional question,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s the one that a lot of people grapple with.</p>
<p>We want to deal with things.</p>
<p>How do we deal with that internal arousal?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>We so often try and change the trauma of the past</p>
<p>in order to control the future.</p>
<p>And what that really adds up to</p>
<p>is the trauma of the past dominates our present, right?</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way.</p>
<p>And remember, we&rsquo;re talking about traumas</p>
<p>that rise to the level of changing the brain.</p>
<p>So as you&rsquo;re saying, that involves re-experience,</p>
<p>it involves hypervigilance, increased arousal,</p>
<p>it changes in mood states, changes in anxiety,</p>
<p>changes in sleep, changes in behavior.</p>
<p>So these are all changes that in a sense</p>
<p>push towards dominating our present, right?</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re not really living in the present, right?</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;re trying to control the future,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not going to do a great job of controlling our future</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re not really living in the present, right?</p>
<p>And so the way to come at that,</p>
<p>again, in the moment, if we&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>in the moment, if I need to fall asleep, right?</p>
<p>I might say, okay, let me try and put that out of my mind.</p>
<p>Let me try and thought redirect.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s short-term strategies</p>
<p>that can let us be functional</p>
<p>in the context of these changes.</p>
<p>But the answer is to go look directly at that thing, right?</p>
<p>Look at that trauma, explore that trauma.</p>
<p>And sure, that can be done with a professional,</p>
<p>and sometimes that&rsquo;s what makes sense, but not always, right?</p>
<p>Sometimes it can be done by talking to another person,</p>
<p>writing it down, right?</p>
<p>Look at what&rsquo;s going on inside of me</p>
<p>that my mind is so stuck to this.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s explore that.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s almost as if we&rsquo;re so afraid so often</p>
<p>of looking at the trauma that has changed us,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll look anywhere but at that, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s hidden in a closet</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll shine the light everywhere else,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re not going to open that door.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where people will say the same</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;ve heard over and over,</p>
<p>and I myself have thought this at times,</p>
<p>like, oh, if I talk about that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to start crying and never stop, right?</p>
<p>Or I&rsquo;m going to just fall apart, right?</p>
<p>Which is never what happens.</p>
<p>No one ever starts crying and never stops, right?</p>
<p>What ends up happening is when the person puts words to it,</p>
<p>right, it could be in writing,</p>
<p>it could be talking to a trusted other or with a therapist,</p>
<p>right, things start to change.</p>
<p>I mean, just the fact that you can talk about it,</p>
<p>you can put words to it,</p>
<p>and other people don&rsquo;t recoil, right?</p>
<p>I mean, how many times has someone said something</p>
<p>for the first time, right?</p>
<p>And when they&rsquo;re telling me about the trauma,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s such an anxious like,</p>
<p>looking like as if I&rsquo;m going to recoil from it, right?</p>
<p>Meaning I&rsquo;m going to recoil from them, right?</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a sense of surprise</p>
<p>if the person says, well, you know,</p>
<p>I was abused by this coach when I was a kid, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s not a, okay,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not a response of recoiling.</p>
<p>You can see the change.</p>
<p>And people will say a lot like, wow,</p>
<p>like I can&rsquo;t believe like,</p>
<p>you can like hear me say that and be okay with it, right?</p>
<p>I mean, so you think about what&rsquo;s going on inside of them,</p>
<p>like how, what a sense of shame,</p>
<p>a sense of, you know, this is something awful about me</p>
<p>for people to recoil from.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just not true,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s where trauma is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s insidious, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s pervasive, right?</p>
<p>Because if that convinces us to continually hide it away,</p>
<p>then how do we explore it?</p>
<p>Like that, you know, that example of the person who says,</p>
<p>okay, I was abused by a coach when I was a child.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m thinking of a couple very real cases, right?</p>
<p>People that I&rsquo;ve taken care of.</p>
<p>And once they start talking about it,</p>
<p>then they start talking about how, you know,</p>
<p>they were just innocent kids, right?</p>
<p>And like, they didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And like, they really wanted to be on the team</p>
<p>where this coach was treating them as special.</p>
<p>And now they can look at themselves from the outside, right?</p>
<p>They can look at themselves</p>
<p>like they would look at someone else, right?</p>
<p>You think it&rsquo;s so easy for us to see what&rsquo;s real and true</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s someone else, right?</p>
<p>If you ask someone,</p>
<p>what do you think of someone who&rsquo;s 10, 11 years old,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s abused and manipulated and abused by an adult?</p>
<p>We say, oh my goodness,</p>
<p>I feel compassion for that person, right?</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s us, right?</p>
<p>Then, oh no, it&rsquo;s guilt and shame</p>
<p>and we have to hide it away.</p>
<p>And when the person starts looking at it,</p>
<p>they can sort of see it from the outside</p>
<p>and it starts to take the energy out of it, right?</p>
<p>Then, well, who should feel guilty about that?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s done something wrong?</p>
<p>And like, so now the conceptions come together,</p>
<p>which is often a reflexive, that was my fault.</p>
<p>Oh, I did it, I went back to it.</p>
<p>I still stayed on the team.</p>
<p>I went back next season, right?</p>
<p>I let it happen again, right?</p>
<p>All the guilt and shame inside the person</p>
<p>gets juxtaposed to like, what really happened there?</p>
<p>And then they say, right, I was a terrified child, right?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t understand at all.</p>
<p>And they can come to a place of compassion.</p>
<p>And now we are working against the guilt and shame.</p>
<p>And if the person cries about it, that&rsquo;s great, right?</p>
<p>I mean, crying is one of the best coping mechanisms we have.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t hurt us and it lets us grieve things.</p>
<p>You know, we can&rsquo;t grieve</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s guilt and shame inside of us.</p>
<p>It just blocks grief, right?</p>
<p>We have to, it has to be a clean slate in a sense,</p>
<p>in order to feel sadness.</p>
<p>And then you see that it shifts from anxiety,</p>
<p>anger, and frustration, usually directed towards the self,</p>
<p>guilt and shame, towards being able to process it</p>
<p>and being able to bring to bear some compassion</p>
<p>and being able to direct the negative emotions,</p>
<p>so to speak, where they&rsquo;re warranted.</p>
<p>And my goodness, the changes that happen.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not like people are miraculously cured, right?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s remarkable how just getting it out there</p>
<p>and having like one hour of talking like that,</p>
<p>like what we&rsquo;re talking about now,</p>
<p>can leave a person feeling immensely better.</p>
<p>It seems to me in hearing this</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s this weird wiring that we have,</p>
<p>because what I&rsquo;m hearing is when traumas happen to us</p>
<p>or we observe them, what we need to do most</p>
<p>is to confront those and the emotions around that directly.</p>
<p>But instead, our system defaults to guilt, shame,</p>
<p>and trying to hide it.</p>
<p>And this repetition compulsion of placing us back</p>
<p>into things similar to those traumas,</p>
<p>or even maybe even worse traumas,</p>
<p>in an attempt to resolve it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the most maladaptive wiring diagram</p>
<p>I could possibly think of.</p>
<p>Emotional and presumably physiological wiring diagram.</p>
<p>And this notion of trying to change the past</p>
<p>by doing things now when the exact opposite</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s going to be beneficial,</p>
<p>also seems like the whole system seems completely backwards.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m chuckling as I said, it&rsquo;s not because I&rsquo;m amused,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m just baffled once again</p>
<p>at how our wiring can often not serve us well.</p>
<p>But it raises what I think is an important</p>
<p>and interesting question, which is earlier</p>
<p>you were talking about how people will seek out media</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really disturbing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll traumatize and re-traumatize themselves</p>
<p>on a daily basis.</p>
<p>So that could be viewed as the repetition compulsion,</p>
<p>where the person will have the same relationship</p>
<p>with seven different, the same abusive relationship</p>
<p>with seven different partners in sequence.</p>
<p>Seems terrible, and yet, as I say this,</p>
<p>it also is becoming clear to me how this almost seems</p>
<p>like a poor but desperate attempt to resolve it in some way.</p>
<p>And so the fork in the road, if I understand correctly,</p>
<p>is to really get to the seed incident,</p>
<p>really get to the thing that started it all,</p>
<p>as opposed to repeating it all.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Does that have to be done in the presence of a therapist?</p>
<p>Is there benefit to taking a walk</p>
<p>and thinking about these things,</p>
<p>breaking down and crying if that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s necessary,</p>
<p>or feeling angry if that&rsquo;s what comes up?</p>
<p>The reason I ask it this way is because</p>
<p>I worry, I&rsquo;ll just speak to my own experience,</p>
<p>I worry that in reactivating or touching into the emotions</p>
<p>around something, that that is itself a form</p>
<p>of the repetition compulsion,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re feeling it all over again.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not seeking out something to evoke that feeling.</p>
<p>So I realize this is a little bit of a circular argument</p>
<p>or question, but I think it&rsquo;s one that I really struggle</p>
<p>with in trying to parse all the outcome-based</p>
<p>therapies that I hear about</p>
<p>and the recommendations that people make.</p>
<p>I mean, how should we conceptualize this?</p>
<p>Something happens, it sounds like we need to deal</p>
<p>with that thing directly.</p>
<p>Do we need to do that with somebody else?</p>
<p>Can we do that on our own?</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t have resources and we have to do it on our own,</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t hire someone, can&rsquo;t pay someone to work with us,</p>
<p>how do we do that in a way that isn&rsquo;t re-traumatizing</p>
<p>ourself in a major way or in a minor way?</p>
<p>How do we know where we are in that landscape?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Again, those are, I think, great questions.</p>
<p>And I think it starts with real introspection.</p>
<p>When things are bouncing around in our minds,</p>
<p>often it&rsquo;s very non-productive, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing over and over again.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not helpful for us, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an idea which sometimes gets called</p>
<p>an observing ego, right?</p>
<p>The ability to stop and look at what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>inside of ourselves.</p>
<p>And so if we&rsquo;re just thinking about it</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re thinking in the same way,</p>
<p>we sort of, in a sense, always think about it,</p>
<p>then all we&rsquo;re doing is reinforcing the trauma, right?</p>
<p>But if we can distance enough to be like,</p>
<p>huh, I&rsquo;m interested in what&rsquo;s going on inside of me, right?</p>
<p>Like I think of a certain person who really loves music.</p>
<p>And then at some point in our therapy work,</p>
<p>I learned that she was taking long drives,</p>
<p>but the radio wasn&rsquo;t on.</p>
<p>And I was like, well, what&rsquo;s going on, right?</p>
<p>And I asked, and what was going on</p>
<p>is she was running over and over again in her head,</p>
<p>like, I&rsquo;m a loser, I&rsquo;m a loser, right?</p>
<p>And she didn&rsquo;t want the music on</p>
<p>because the music would drown out</p>
<p>what she felt she had to say to herself, right?</p>
<p>And it was that like, wow, that&rsquo;s interesting, right?</p>
<p>And then her ability to observe that</p>
<p>and to think, why am I doing that</p>
<p>when it comes into her mind?</p>
<p>Like, what does that trace to?</p>
<p>When did I start doing that?</p>
<p>Like I said, I&rsquo;m saying it for a point of exaggeration,</p>
<p>nobody comes out of the womb</p>
<p>programmed to think I&rsquo;m a loser, right?</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t think that when we&rsquo;re born, right?</p>
<p>So where does that come from?</p>
<p>Then we can think in ways</p>
<p>that allow us to have new thoughts, right?</p>
<p>That we weren&rsquo;t having,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just bouncing around in our minds.</p>
<p>And if we speak or write,</p>
<p>there are even more mechanisms</p>
<p>that come online in our brains, right?</p>
<p>That are then sort of monitoring mechanisms.</p>
<p>We think in a different way if we&rsquo;re using words, right?</p>
<p>And we are better able often</p>
<p>to bring in that observing ego,</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s going on inside of me.</p>
<p>So it can be very helpful to think,</p>
<p>it can be helpful to talk to someone,</p>
<p>to a trusted other, friend, family, clergy, to write.</p>
<p>I mean, these are things that can be done</p>
<p>without expending any resources, right?</p>
<p>And sometimes it can make really a big difference, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a wait, when did I start thinking that?</p>
<p>And like, interestingly in this case,</p>
<p>okay, we did it in therapy,</p>
<p>but it became very clear what that was rooted to, right?</p>
<p>And then in the therapy, which was still relatively young,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;d done several sessions</p>
<p>and we weren&rsquo;t talking at all</p>
<p>about what we needed to talk about, right?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what got us to what we needed to talk about.</p>
<p>And when did that start?</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re in that same place of exploring that</p>
<p>and what was the reflex to it</p>
<p>and the sense of guilt and sense of shame.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s where all of that came from.</p>
<p>That just got boiled down to, I&rsquo;m a loser, right?</p>
<p>Which this person didn&rsquo;t even have in their mind.</p>
<p>Like, I didn&rsquo;t think about myself that way, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so interesting, right?</p>
<p>That our memories don&rsquo;t in and of themselves have meaning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re flat or colorless, right?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re colored in by the emotions</p>
<p>that we attach to them, right?</p>
<p>So the idea that certain memories now before the trauma</p>
<p>were changed by the trauma.</p>
<p>So I tell the story sometimes of a person</p>
<p>who won an award when they were in high school</p>
<p>that they thought was, oh my gosh,</p>
<p>like it shows like I can do it, right?</p>
<p>And get out there that after trauma,</p>
<p>they saw the award with a negative emotion attached to it.</p>
<p>That was like, oh, it was given to me</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t deserve it.</p>
<p>And almost it was mocking,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s going to be the greatest achievement of my life.</p>
<p>And I was 17 or so.</p>
<p>And to have someone think like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not how they felt about that at the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the trauma that changed the self-talk,</p>
<p>the internal state going forward.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re talking about miraculous in a negative way,</p>
<p>also change that going backward, right?</p>
<p>And when we can really look at like,</p>
<p>where did that come from?</p>
<p>And we can start unraveling it, it changes.</p>
<p>So in those cases,</p>
<p>often it&rsquo;s helpful to have a good therapist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always necessary.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s certainly, it&rsquo;s not always possible, right?</p>
<p>So we need other strategies.</p>
<p>And some of those, I write about some of those in the book</p>
<p>of how can we sort of get at trauma</p>
<p>without those formalized mechanisms.</p>
<p>And sometimes if the symptoms are significant enough,</p>
<p>like we really do need to talk to somebody professional</p>
<p>who can help us get to the root of the trauma.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so many times,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the answer to what&rsquo;s going on with people.</p>
<p>You know, people I&rsquo;ve seen have had five residential stays,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not exaggerating this,</p>
<p>for mental health reasons, for substance reasons,</p>
<p>and no one&rsquo;s ever taken a trauma history.</p>
<p>And then when you take a trauma history,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s obviously where this is all coming from, right?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s when the drug use started shortly thereafter,</p>
<p>the negative self-talk and the negative feelings</p>
<p>that led to the drug use.</p>
<p>Then you go after the trauma and you can change things.</p>
<p>Whereas trying to change things without looking,</p>
<p>introspecting, talking about the trauma,</p>
<p>I think of course was futile.</p>
<p>Do you think that people can</p>
<p>start to have negative fantasies?</p>
<p>I mean, you mentioned this woman</p>
<p>who would take these long drives to berate herself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not familiar with that,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll give a little bit of personal disclosure here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve felt several times in my life</p>
<p>that I will start to create a narrative</p>
<p>about something that truly hasn&rsquo;t happened,</p>
<p>about something terrible that somebody is going to do</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to upset me.</p>
<p>And for the longest time, I would wonder,</p>
<p>why am I doing this?</p>
<p>And I have a couple ideas about why.</p>
<p>One is that I was attempting to</p>
<p>just avoid thinking about other things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, anger is such an attractive emotional force</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an attractant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not attractive, we don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>And yet oftentimes anger is a great way</p>
<p>to replace feeling something else,</p>
<p>feeling sad or having to come up</p>
<p>or to do work or to do something useful.</p>
<p>So it has this kind of like gravitational force to it.</p>
<p>That was one idea.</p>
<p>The other idea was in imagining kind of worst outcomes,</p>
<p>then actually that relationship</p>
<p>could actually seem a lot better in reality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like creating this negative contrast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, well then it&rsquo;s not that bad.</p>
<p>And then the third possibility is I have no idea why,</p>
<p>but it seemed like a reflex</p>
<p>and I spent some time thinking about it.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ve resolved it completely,</p>
<p>but why would somebody have a narrative</p>
<p>or a default narrative when driving or when walking</p>
<p>of I&rsquo;m just going to spend some time</p>
<p>and think about how terrible this thing is going to turn out</p>
<p>or how someone&rsquo;s going to upset me or harm me</p>
<p>or how terrible I am.</p>
<p>It seems again, like maladaptive thinking,</p>
<p>maladaptive wiring,</p>
<p>and yet I have to assume that it serves some purpose.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I think there are three factors there</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all bad.</p>
<p>And I think you spoke to at least two of them, right?</p>
<p>They, I think, speak so powerfully</p>
<p>to how insidious trauma is</p>
<p>and how these are real brain changes inside of us.</p>
<p>So I would say the three factors,</p>
<p>punishment, avoidance, and control, right?</p>
<p>So the trauma inside of us that makes a guilt and shame</p>
<p>so often, so often leads to a desire to punish oneself,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>And the idea that, oh, that was my fault or I deserve that.</p>
<p>Well, what do we do if something is someone&rsquo;s fault</p>
<p>and someone now deserves punishment, right?</p>
<p>I mean, we punish them, right?</p>
<p>We send them to jail, we give them a fine, right?</p>
<p>We punish them.</p>
<p>And so what we do is punish ourselves, right?</p>
<p>And if we tell ourselves we&rsquo;re a loser</p>
<p>or this awful thing is going to happen, right?</p>
<p>Then part of what we&rsquo;re doing is saying to ourselves,</p>
<p>see, right, you deserve that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to have anything better, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a negative,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very negative way that the brain tries to make us</p>
<p>in a sense, do better by hurting us more</p>
<p>for the things that we couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>and shouldn&rsquo;t have been able to,</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t expected to be to control in the first place, right?</p>
<p>The second is distraction.</p>
<p>As you said, anger, that kind of fantasy can distract us</p>
<p>from affect, feeling, and emotion</p>
<p>that can be much more negative.</p>
<p>You know, anger, it can be more gratifying</p>
<p>than certainly than guilt or shame.</p>
<p>Although guilt and shame can serve a punishment purpose,</p>
<p>but if anger is directed also towards ourselves, right?</p>
<p>Then it can serve punishment too.</p>
<p>So punishment, avoidance, and the sense of control</p>
<p>that if you think ahead to something awful</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re imagining is going to happen,</p>
<p>well, maybe that will let you avoid it, right?</p>
<p>I mean, you can see the brain here in a sense,</p>
<p>really confused.</p>
<p>I mean, part of the brain wants to punish,</p>
<p>part of the brain doesn&rsquo;t want to think about it at all,</p>
<p>and part of the brain wants to make it better.</p>
<p>And then how all of that resolves,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re not aware that, hey,</p>
<p>this is in the context of our brains</p>
<p>being deeply impacted by trauma.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s going on here is all maladaptive, right?</p>
<p>Because these negative fantasies of the future,</p>
<p>they may help us feel better about something in the present,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t help us make anything better, right?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t help us make anything better.</p>
<p>So this is the kind of the sequelae.</p>
<p>This is where trauma and all this reflexive stuff</p>
<p>that happens after trauma ultimately lead us.</p>
<p>And you can see how we get lost,</p>
<p>how I&rsquo;ve seen over and over again in my own life,</p>
<p>in the lives of other people,</p>
<p>how, man, we get stuck in those situations.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I see people sometimes,</p>
<p>this has been going on for 30 years, 40 years, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just been going on over and over and over again</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no natural end to any of this, right?</p>
<p>Unless we look at it in a different way,</p>
<p>that we have knowledge and information like,</p>
<p>whoa, this isn&rsquo;t the way it has to be.</p>
<p>Let me bring a novel perspective to this.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t change on its own.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m struck by your statement that these thoughts</p>
<p>or behaviors can make us feel better,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t actually make anything better.</p>
<p>In that way, this mode of imagining terrible outcomes</p>
<p>starts to immediately seem like taking opioids.</p>
<p>You feel better in the moment,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t actually make anything better</p>
<p>and it probably makes things worse.</p>
<p>And just as a question of how much worse</p>
<p>and in what direction.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And so I just want to just pause on that concept</p>
<p>because I think that concept of makes us feel better,</p>
<p>but doesn&rsquo;t make anything better,</p>
<p>I think it answers an earlier question</p>
<p>about what seems to be a totally maladaptive wiring diagram.</p>
<p>We need to confront the thing,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t want to go into the repetition compulsion.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a knife edge there to navigate through trauma.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Working with a very skilled clinician like yourself,</p>
<p>I think is the ideal circumstance for people.</p>
<p>And of course, there are people who can&rsquo;t access support</p>
<p>from somebody for whatever reason.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked about journaling as a useful tool.</p>
<p>Maybe you highlight some of the other things</p>
<p>that people can do on their own.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;d also like to talk about</p>
<p>what makes for a good therapist.</p>
<p>What should people look for</p>
<p>for those that are seeking therapy,</p>
<p>especially nowadays when a lot of therapy</p>
<p>is being done remotely.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s just start with the,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just call them self-generated</p>
<p>or zero cost sorts of things.</p>
<p>Journaling being the first,</p>
<p>and then what are some of the others</p>
<p>and what kind of structure would you recommend</p>
<p>someone put around journaling?</p>
<p>Carry a journal around all day</p>
<p>and jot things down as they come up</p>
<p>or sit down and spend an hour</p>
<p>writing in complete sentences, for instance.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If I could add something to what you just said</p>
<p>before the question,</p>
<p>that we have these short-term coping mechanisms in us.</p>
<p>And in a way it makes sense.</p>
<p>We find ourselves in just terrible situations,</p>
<p>then a short-term coping mechanism</p>
<p>can get us through them.</p>
<p>So our brains are built that way</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s part of survival too.</p>
<p>And whether now in the modern world,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s food, it&rsquo;s drugs, it&rsquo;s sex,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s alcohol, right?</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s negative thoughts, right?</p>
<p>This is short-term soothing.</p>
<p>Even the negative thoughts,</p>
<p>the anger is short-term soothing</p>
<p>at the expense of long-term change, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where addictive pathways come into play.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where again,</p>
<p>how we&rsquo;re built evolutionarily for survival</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t help us in the way humans have evolved.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t lived this way throughout</p>
<p>99.9 something percent of human history, right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not adapted to this.</p>
<p>So I want to just make a point of saying that</p>
<p>about the short-term soothing</p>
<p>at the expense of any of long-term change.</p>
<p>And then the question you had asked about,</p>
<p>say journaling or what can we do</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s outside of a professional,</p>
<p>I think the hallmark of it</p>
<p>has to be bringing new eyes to it, right?</p>
<p>Like thinking about self with a curiosity</p>
<p>instead of just a simple automaticity or repetition, right?</p>
<p>Like, why am I thinking about this?</p>
<p>When did this start?</p>
<p>Why is this in me, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that, whether it&rsquo;s words</p>
<p>or whether we&rsquo;re writing that&rsquo;s so important.</p>
<p>So I think for journaling, it depends on the person.</p>
<p>You know, I mean,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t want somebody carrying around a journal all day</p>
<p>if then there&rsquo;s a compulsion to,</p>
<p>I need to write about everything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going on in my mind, right?</p>
<p>Like that might be good to,</p>
<p>okay, write a little bit at night, right?</p>
<p>Or someone who might think,</p>
<p>sometimes this really comes into my mind in a strong way</p>
<p>and it could be unpredictable, right?</p>
<p>I want to have the journal with me.</p>
<p>So, ah, that thing is back in my mind now,</p>
<p>let me write about it, right?</p>
<p>Because then putting words to it</p>
<p>and then being able to read those words, right?</p>
<p>And when people read,</p>
<p>even do a little bit of journaling and they read like,</p>
<p>oh, I thought again about how I&rsquo;m a terrible person</p>
<p>who can&rsquo;t have a good life</p>
<p>because I was in such a bad car accident</p>
<p>or because that person attacked me</p>
<p>or because when I was in school,</p>
<p>I was bullied because I look different than everyone else,</p>
<p>right, or I acted different from everyone else.</p>
<p>Wow, you know, to actually see that written out,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s a little bit of that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit of that,</p>
<p>like when you&rsquo;re saying it to someone</p>
<p>as if it were someone else, right?</p>
<p>Because now there&rsquo;s enough distance from it.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m looking at the words I wrote, right?</p>
<p>That we get some distance</p>
<p>and we can start to integrate some of the,</p>
<p>not just the compassion,</p>
<p>but integrating compassion and logic, right?</p>
<p>Of like, okay, I feel a sense of compassion.</p>
<p>Now wait, what does this mean?</p>
<p>What really happened here, right?</p>
<p>And gosh, I did start thinking differently after that.</p>
<p>I started to, that&rsquo;s where this came from, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m saying this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s those kinds of revelations that we can have</p>
<p>through, again, the written or spoken word.</p>
<p>And I think, again, that involves a trusted other,</p>
<p>you know, or writing.</p>
<p>And I think that those are ways we can do this</p>
<p>where we bring some de novo perspective</p>
<p>to something that often has been bouncing around</p>
<p>inside of us.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s amazing to me that I can see such intelligent,</p>
<p>empathically attuned people who&rsquo;ve had the same thing</p>
<p>running over and over again in their mind for years.</p>
<p>And it just points out that our brains</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t automatically say, hey, wait a second, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been spinning wheels here for a long, long time.</p>
<p>Like, was there another way to look at this?</p>
<p>We need something from the outside</p>
<p>which can just be knowledge, right?</p>
<p>Which is why I think what we&rsquo;re doing here</p>
<p>or the reason I wrote the book that I wrote</p>
<p>was like apprehending this like amazing surprise to me,</p>
<p>right, which is like, wow, like some huge percentage</p>
<p>of everything I&rsquo;m treating is rooted in trauma</p>
<p>and the opacity of trauma, right?</p>
<p>Which is why we don&rsquo;t see that, oh, the depression,</p>
<p>the panic attacks, the life change, the addiction,</p>
<p>the, you know, the maladaptive choices,</p>
<p>like, oh, this is all coming from trauma</p>
<p>because it hides itself in that opacity.</p>
<p>So we need a de novo perspective</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re doing it on our own</p>
<p>and we need that if we&rsquo;re doing it in therapy,</p>
<p>which might link to like finding the right therapist,</p>
<p>right, which is also part of your question.</p>
<p>Yeah, I definitely want to know about how to assess</p>
<p>and find the right therapist.</p>
<p>Before we cover that, however,</p>
<p>something came up in the course of your answer.</p>
<p>I can immediately relate to this idea</p>
<p>that certain behaviors are really maladaptive</p>
<p>and are stuffing things down</p>
<p>or avoiding the topic is problematic</p>
<p>and bringing a curiosity and an introspection</p>
<p>and almost a third personing of the experience</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve had in order to try and address it</p>
<p>from a truly from a new perspective.</p>
<p>It occurred to me as we were discussing this, however,</p>
<p>that some people, and yes,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;m talking a little bit about my own experience.</p>
<p>We have a sense of our own identity</p>
<p>and how people view us</p>
<p>and our ability to be functional in the world</p>
<p>in ways that we like, effective at work or a good brother</p>
<p>or a good mother or father or human being in the world.</p>
<p>We have relationships.</p>
<p>And I think that one thing that I have heard</p>
<p>and maybe I&rsquo;ve experienced</p>
<p>is that sometimes those maladaptive thoughts or behaviors,</p>
<p>the things that generate a kind of a repetition of anger</p>
<p>or of arousal or activation or sadness,</p>
<p>that we have some internal process</p>
<p>where we funnel that into a functionality in the world.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll give a more concrete example.</p>
<p>So in thinking about things that have upset me in the past</p>
<p>and in imagining bad outcomes in the future,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a certain internal state of arousal</p>
<p>that comes about.</p>
<p>And for many years, I was able to use that,</p>
<p>not to feel angry,</p>
<p>but rather to work an extra three hours a day</p>
<p>or to pack my schedule with work and social engagement</p>
<p>so I could show up in a way that I,</p>
<p>hopefully was a very good brother to my sister,</p>
<p>for instance.</p>
<p>So in a way, it was a transformation</p>
<p>of something negative inside of me</p>
<p>into a functionality in the world</p>
<p>that was actually very rewarding and beneficial.</p>
<p>And yet in describing it,</p>
<p>I can immediately see how it would be wonderful</p>
<p>if I could source from something else.</p>
<p>And yet I, you can imagine,</p>
<p>and I can imagine how one would be reluctant,</p>
<p>maybe even terrified of giving up that source.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fuel.</p>
<p>And I think in knowing some of the traumas of other people</p>
<p>and their reluctance to work through those,</p>
<p>obviously I&rsquo;m not a therapist,</p>
<p>I sense this over and over again,</p>
<p>that one&rsquo;s positive identity</p>
<p>can often be linked to something difficult in their past.</p>
<p>And so people are reluctant to give up this fuel</p>
<p>because in that sense, it&rsquo;s functional.</p>
<p>The only thing that allowed me to kind of start</p>
<p>to address this and why I&rsquo;m still so curious about this,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve worked</p>
<p>through this process completely,</p>
<p>again, a little more self-disclosure there,</p>
<p>is that I was told that these words,</p>
<p>just imagine how much better it would be</p>
<p>if you could source from a different fuel,</p>
<p>a fuel that felt better.</p>
<p>Maybe, it was on this sentence,</p>
<p>it was maybe you could actually be much more effective.</p>
<p>Maybe you could be 10 times the better brother.</p>
<p>Maybe you could have 10 times</p>
<p>more insider work capacity, et cetera.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s on that hint of a promise</p>
<p>that at least I was inspired to start</p>
<p>looking into these things</p>
<p>and reading about trauma in your book and elsewhere</p>
<p>and start to think about this.</p>
<p>So again, I realize this is a long-winded question</p>
<p>and a somewhat complex idea,</p>
<p>but I think, or I hope that people will be able</p>
<p>to resonate with this idea</p>
<p>that sometimes we want to stay attached</p>
<p>to this short-term soothing,</p>
<p>that the punishment, distraction, or control,</p>
<p>because it evokes this arousal</p>
<p>and then we can apply that arousal.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>I think what you&rsquo;re describing maps, I think,</p>
<p>clinically to what gets called sublimation.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something negative inside of us,</p>
<p>but we sort of transfer that energy,</p>
<p>we transfer that into something</p>
<p>that is adaptive or that is positive.</p>
<p>So the idea of the anger, right?</p>
<p>When I think of that thing and it makes anger in me,</p>
<p>I channel that into harder work, right?</p>
<p>Or I channel that into like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go be nicer to my brother,</p>
<p>something like that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s validity to that, right?</p>
<p>But it can become like self-justifying</p>
<p>if a person thinks,</p>
<p>well, look at what this is doing for me, right?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t work as hard without it, right?</p>
<p>Now we start to become attached to the trauma,</p>
<p>whereas I think what you had said is absolutely true,</p>
<p>that just because we can sublimate</p>
<p>some of the negative affect, feeling, emotion</p>
<p>that comes from trauma into something productive</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that that&rsquo;s best, right?</p>
<p>We know we can get to our destination</p>
<p>by taking a very circuitous route, right?</p>
<p>We might waste an hour getting there, but we get there.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that that&rsquo;s best.</p>
<p>And it also doesn&rsquo;t look at all the negative, right?</p>
<p>In this example, the wasted fuel, the wasted time, right?</p>
<p>We get somewhere, but we are not optimizing.</p>
<p>And I have yet to see one person</p>
<p>who has addressed the trauma and become less functional,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always either they&rsquo;re just as functional,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re happier, right?</p>
<p>Or more functional, because as you said,</p>
<p>like just because we may be able to sublimate,</p>
<p>well, maybe what&rsquo;s going on would be 10 times better,</p>
<p>right, if we weren&rsquo;t sublimating,</p>
<p>because the sublimation limits us, right?</p>
<p>It limits our perspective to only what we can see and do</p>
<p>through the lens of the trauma.</p>
<p>And that is never better than the alternative.</p>
<p>Thank you for that.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s discuss how one could or should go about</p>
<p>finding a really good therapist.</p>
<p>Typically, in my experience, this is done by word of mouth.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s this person,</p>
<p>you might want to work with them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really great.</p>
<p>But what are some of the characteristics</p>
<p>that one should look for?</p>
<p>And should we take into account whether or not</p>
<p>we are a person who, you know, for instance,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard this from listeners,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;m definitely not talking about myself here</p>
<p>in cloaking something.</p>
<p>Some people will say, you know,</p>
<p>I want to work with a somatic therapist</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve actually heard someone say,</p>
<p>I think in feels, they, you know,</p>
<p>I feel stuff in my body.</p>
<p>So I want to work with someone</p>
<p>who can really acknowledge that.</p>
<p>Or someone else will say, you know,</p>
<p>I want to work with somebody who has this orientation</p>
<p>or that orientation, or is open to my particular lifestyle,</p>
<p>or isn&rsquo;t going to tell me</p>
<p>that I have to leave my relationship.</p>
<p>You know, I feel like people already show up</p>
<p>to the question of who to work with,</p>
<p>with all these, you know, things internally,</p>
<p>some of which are voiced and some of which aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d love for you to talk about maybe some of the,</p>
<p>the core features of a really good therapist,</p>
<p>and then how to look for a therapist,</p>
<p>and also how to think about oneself</p>
<p>in looking for a therapist</p>
<p>because of these kind of predispositions.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a lot of data about this over the years</p>
<p>that if you look at what are the top 10 important factors</p>
<p>to find in a therapist, just repeat rapport 10 times, right?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the key.</p>
<p>And if you think about that, it&rsquo;s pretty amazing, right?</p>
<p>Because therapeutic modalities can be so different, right?</p>
<p>And I think what that&rsquo;s telling us is,</p>
<p>in a way, something very obvious, right?</p>
<p>Like, what does rapport mean?</p>
<p>Like, you know, it&rsquo;s somebody&rsquo;s paying attention, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trust, it&rsquo;s a back and forth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yeah, even though I&rsquo;m doing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing something difficult,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing it with someone who&rsquo;s really helping me,</p>
<p>someone who&rsquo;s in it with me, right?</p>
<p>Someone who&rsquo;s really paying attention,</p>
<p>wants me to be better, that&rsquo;s indispensable.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just indispensable.</p>
<p>And I write in the book,</p>
<p>if someone, a therapist is not making eye contact,</p>
<p>or this is the way they do it, right?</p>
<p>And, you know, you got to fit into the box</p>
<p>of the way they do it.</p>
<p>That is not going to be helpful.</p>
<p>And then what I think about that</p>
<p>is the different modalities.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t actually tell us that,</p>
<p>oh, the modality is irrelevant.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>I think that good therapists are not pigeonholed</p>
<p>by a certain modality.</p>
<p>They may, you know, come at the world</p>
<p>largely through a psychodynamic,</p>
<p>or a CBT, or a DBT lens,</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s lots of different ways to do therapy.</p>
<p>But when you really talk to those people,</p>
<p>really good experienced therapists,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all coming through the vehicle of the rapport,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re practically shifting to what the person needs.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t understand the idea that like,</p>
<p>oh, I just do this, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>And when people are pigeonholed that way,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they help their patients very well, right?</p>
<p>We have to be diverse enough to say,</p>
<p>hey, I want all the arrows in the quiver, right?</p>
<p>And even though there might be one that I favor,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the lens I see things through,</p>
<p>no, I can be versatile, I can shift,</p>
<p>I can adapt to what this person needs.</p>
<p>And I think if you have that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got a winning combination.</p>
<p>Great, so people should perhaps try a few therapists</p>
<p>and maybe have a session or two or three</p>
<p>to see if the rapport feels like it&rsquo;s taking root.</p>
<p>Is that, do I have that right?</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think that&rsquo;s why word of mouth is important,</p>
<p>right, if someone you trust tells you,</p>
<p>hey, this is a good person, that says a lot, right?</p>
<p>It already makes the pretest probability is quite high.</p>
<p>But yes, it&rsquo;s interesting to see when people have a therapist</p>
<p>or they call their insurance</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re assigned a therapist,</p>
<p>this thought that like,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s the person I have to have now.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, no, you should look at that like anyone,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;d be interviewing, right, for a job, right?</p>
<p>But you got to bring, again,</p>
<p>the right set of thoughts to that to be helped, right?</p>
<p>Which is like, I want someone who has rapport with me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want someone who&rsquo;s going to make it easy, right?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s like, well, it&rsquo;s gosh, it&rsquo;s kind of pleasant</p>
<p>because then that means they&rsquo;re not talking</p>
<p>about the difficult things, right?</p>
<p>So if one brings like, I know this isn&rsquo;t going to be easy,</p>
<p>I got to talk about difficult things, right?</p>
<p>Even if one doesn&rsquo;t recognize,</p>
<p>oh, I got to talk about the trauma in me, right?</p>
<p>But to go to therapy thinking, no, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I mean, sometimes it&rsquo;s enjoyable,</p>
<p>but a lot of times, right, it&rsquo;s not, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard work, it can be excruciating,</p>
<p>we can cry doing it, but to say, right,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;m going to be helped.</p>
<p>And I want someone who&rsquo;s going to do that with me,</p>
<p>you know, who&rsquo;s really looking at what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>inside of me, how do we help me?</p>
<p>And I can feel sort of the robustness of that.</p>
<p>If one brings that approach and then looks at the therapist</p>
<p>through that lens, you&rsquo;re very likely to then move on</p>
<p>from someone who&rsquo;s not a good choice, right?</p>
<p>And really stick with someone who is,</p>
<p>even though that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s always like pleasant</p>
<p>and enjoyable, I mean, it has to not be that sometimes.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Maybe we could drill a little deeper</p>
<p>into the mechanics of therapy.</p>
<p>I put out a few questions to audience</p>
<p>asking what they want to know about therapy.</p>
<p>And it was amazing, I got hundreds,</p>
<p>if not thousands of responses saying,</p>
<p>how should I show up to therapy?</p>
<p>So for instance, should people take a five minute</p>
<p>meditative drop in before, or should they just show up cold</p>
<p>and let it emerge?</p>
<p>During therapy, is it a good idea to take notes</p>
<p>or to not take notes?</p>
<p>And then post-therapy, how should clients, patients,</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;re sometimes called one or the other,</p>
<p>I never know which, how should they process that information?</p>
<p>Should they take some designated time afterwards</p>
<p>and in an ideal world, take a 30 minute walk afterwards</p>
<p>and think about the material, or should they set it aside</p>
<p>and come back to it?</p>
<p>Of course there are constraints, work and family, et cetera.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot of knowledge out there</p>
<p>about how to best show up to a workout,</p>
<p>warm up for five, 10 minutes, then do this, et cetera.</p>
<p>And then the cool down, I mean,</p>
<p>here we&rsquo;re talking about hard psychological work</p>
<p>aimed at bettering oneself.</p>
<p>So to my knowledge, I&rsquo;ve not ever seen this information</p>
<p>anywhere, it&rsquo;d be very useful to hear your thoughts on this.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I&rsquo;m not trying to duck the question,</p>
<p>but I think it varies so much by person.</p>
<p>So if you think about the first part of your question,</p>
<p>I think was how to show up to therapy, right?</p>
<p>And I think the answer would be whatever lets you</p>
<p>be fully present when you&rsquo;re in therapy.</p>
<p>Now for some people that&rsquo;s gonna be, I show up early,</p>
<p>I sit, I calm myself, I meditate a little bit.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s how then they&rsquo;re present, right?</p>
<p>For other people, they just show up, walk into the room,</p>
<p>they can stop another present, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s whatever works for that person</p>
<p>so that they&rsquo;re really there, their thoughts,</p>
<p>their energy is really in what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And the same thing applies on the other end.</p>
<p>There are people who are really well-served</p>
<p>by going for a walk if they can,</p>
<p>or sitting quietly after therapy,</p>
<p>kind of putting that in order, right?</p>
<p>Otherwise they lose some of it, right?</p>
<p>Or like some of the ahas, right?</p>
<p>Or the, oh, that&rsquo;s an interesting thought</p>
<p>that they really need to put it in order.</p>
<p>Maybe that involves taking some notes during therapy, right?</p>
<p>For other people, they need to do the exact opposite.</p>
<p>They need to like leave, not think about that at all,</p>
<p>and then they can reflect on it later and learn from it.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re so different, human beings,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s such a diversity in us</p>
<p>that I think there&rsquo;s no hard answer to that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like being present when it&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>then being able to sort of consolidate</p>
<p>and retain what&rsquo;s been gained is most important.</p>
<p>And I think we have to figure that out person by person.</p>
<p>I mean, I try and do that in the work</p>
<p>of like what&rsquo;s serving this person best.</p>
<p>And sometimes we, I think sometimes it evolves</p>
<p>and sometimes we talk about it, but it varies so much.</p>
<p>If someone were thinking about embarking on therapy</p>
<p>or more therapy to address trauma</p>
<p>or just general issues of life,</p>
<p>what is the frequency that you recommend?</p>
<p>I could imagine two extreme models.</p>
<p>One is, okay, I&rsquo;m going to finally tackle this trauma.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do therapy three times a week,</p>
<p>but for a shorter period of time,</p>
<p>six months over and out,</p>
<p>versus this open-ended model of once a week,</p>
<p>typically for as long as it takes.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>I think that also varies.</p>
<p>And I work with people in varied ways</p>
<p>from someone who&rsquo;s doing well</p>
<p>and like we meet for a half hour every six months, right?</p>
<p>To doing week-long hourly sessions,</p>
<p>to spending three intense days with someone in a row, right?</p>
<p>So I think as far as like kind of guiding principles,</p>
<p>what I have found in my own life,</p>
<p>because I value my own therapy tremendously.</p>
<p>So I found in my own life and in my own clinical work</p>
<p>that if it&rsquo;s less than once a week,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s hard for us to retain really.</p>
<p>You know, we spend a lot of time kind of catching up.</p>
<p>Okay, what&rsquo;s happened?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get back to the place we were at before, right?</p>
<p>Which is why I think if we&rsquo;re really going to get somewhere,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not just trying to maintain something, right?</p>
<p>Then I think once a week for an hour</p>
<p>is really kind of the minimum, right?</p>
<p>But more intensive work, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>the more intense it is, it&rsquo;s not linear, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an exponential gain.</p>
<p>Like we do a lot of intensive work, right?</p>
<p>Where someone will come and do 30 clinical hours with us</p>
<p>over the course of a week.</p>
<p>So five or six different clinicians, 30 clinical hours.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve found that the benefits of doing that are immense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;d say a year&rsquo;s worth of therapy consolidated.</p>
<p>And you just take, well, 30 hours,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, you know, we go almost every week,</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s 45 or 50 hours,</p>
<p>but 30 hours with that kind of intensity</p>
<p>is worth probably 60 hours, you know,</p>
<p>done in a different way.</p>
<p>Because then it&rsquo;s in us in an active way, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the therapist in an active way.</p>
<p>It becomes very, very dynamic.</p>
<p>So I think turning up the intensity,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s something that we really need to process,</p>
<p>absolutely makes sense.</p>
<p>And I do that in my own life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something now it&rsquo;s like, whoa,</p>
<p>something is really distressing me</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s linking into prior trauma.</p>
<p>And I can see what&rsquo;s going on in me.</p>
<p>Now I start to have ruminative thoughts,</p>
<p>you know, with negativity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I gotta go more, right?</p>
<p>Because I gotta do that processing</p>
<p>so I can get to the place that I am,</p>
<p>which is not that the trauma has no impact on me, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that the impact is much less</p>
<p>than it was before the therapy.</p>
<p>And that I most often, more often than not,</p>
<p>have an ability to see</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s now intruding into my thoughts</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s taking me away</p>
<p>from like what I really think and believe</p>
<p>or being able to draw logic and emotion together</p>
<p>and make good decisions.</p>
<p>Turning up the intensity then absolutely makes sense.</p>
<p>This very deep intensive work of 30 hours in a week,</p>
<p>what brings somebody to the type of work of that sort?</p>
<p>Is it a suicide risk or a severe addiction situation?</p>
<p>I mean, how does one gauge</p>
<p>how much therapy they ought to be doing?</p>
<p>And should it always be on the therapist</p>
<p>to decide that frequency?</p>
<p>What would bring someone to a situation</p>
<p>of five therapists and 30 hours a week in one week?</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually a person who is really distressed by something,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s so negatively impacting their life</p>
<p>or sometimes a person comes to realization,</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t take this anymore, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sick of the cyclical depression.</p>
<p>I gotta stop having panic attacks.</p>
<p>Like I need help, right?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s usually some crisis point</p>
<p>with the idea of crisis and the meaning of,</p>
<p>okay, something comes to a head</p>
<p>and after it, things are gonna be different, right?</p>
<p>Not a crisis and things are gonna be negative afterwards,</p>
<p>but a point where then that cognitive flexibility</p>
<p>comes to the fore of like,</p>
<p>wait, I need to do something different, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s often what brings us,</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s other people pointing it out</p>
<p>or somebody&rsquo;s had an intervention somewhere</p>
<p>or yes, that person&rsquo;s been hospitalized</p>
<p>after a suicide attempt</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ve gone back to rehab again</p>
<p>for the third or fourth time</p>
<p>and their life is really in danger.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s that,</p>
<p>and sometimes it&rsquo;s a person realizing,</p>
<p>yeah, I just wanna, I wanna look at myself,</p>
<p>wanna understand myself better.</p>
<p>I know that what&rsquo;s going on in me</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t as good as it can be, right?</p>
<p>So I think people can come to it</p>
<p>for all sorts of different ways.</p>
<p>And I think, yes, I think a lot of times</p>
<p>it would be the therapist to say it looks more work,</p>
<p>more intensive work or can make a difference.</p>
<p>But I think the person also needs to take ownership, right?</p>
<p>Of their own therapy</p>
<p>and say, if I don&rsquo;t feel helped enough,</p>
<p>well, I have to think about that, right?</p>
<p>And talk to the therapist about that</p>
<p>because maybe that therapist isn&rsquo;t a match, right?</p>
<p>Or maybe you talk to the therapist</p>
<p>and the therapist can change his or her approach, right?</p>
<p>Or maybe you talk to the therapist</p>
<p>and increase the frequency, right?</p>
<p>But the idea is to be aware of it, right?</p>
<p>And if one&rsquo;s needs aren&rsquo;t being met,</p>
<p>to acknowledge that, right?</p>
<p>Because people can get into a rhythm of therapy</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s really not helping them, right?</p>
<p>But they either feel sort of nihilistic about it,</p>
<p>like, oh, I&rsquo;m no better and I&rsquo;m going to therapy, right?</p>
<p>Or sometimes there&rsquo;s a sense that while I&rsquo;m in therapy,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m kind of checking that box</p>
<p>of doing something for myself,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not really getting me anywhere.</p>
<p>And then the part of the brain</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s controlled by the guilt and shame and avoidance</p>
<p>thinks that&rsquo;s a great idea, right?</p>
<p>So again, this ability to observe ourselves</p>
<p>and like, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>Am I being helped in the way I, do I feel helped, right?</p>
<p>Am I, in some ways, even like happy</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not feeling helped</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t have to face this thing</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to face, right?</p>
<p>Or am I too afraid to say I need more help, right?</p>
<p>Do we really need to look at ourselves?</p>
<p>And this is where the insurance systems</p>
<p>often are very difficult</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s hard sometimes for a person to say,</p>
<p>oh, I need more therapy</p>
<p>because that may not be possible, right?</p>
<p>So there are sort of negative factors</p>
<p>in the world around us,</p>
<p>but ultimately I think the answer to the question</p>
<p>comes down to observing ourselves</p>
<p>and taking ownership of like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on in us and how we&rsquo;re feeling</p>
<p>and then feeling that commitment to self</p>
<p>or to self care to say, I need to go change this.</p>
<p>And for those that maybe don&rsquo;t have the means</p>
<p>or insurance or access to do even one day a week therapy</p>
<p>in the journaling model,</p>
<p>could one perhaps take an entire day,</p>
<p>as awful as it might seem,</p>
<p>to do a lot of journaling and thinking and walking,</p>
<p>do a self-generated intensive.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s utility to that?</p>
<p>There could be, but again, it depends by person</p>
<p>because there could also be something negative about that.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s someone who&rsquo;s not at the point,</p>
<p>not ready for that, right?</p>
<p>I mean, we don&rsquo;t come directly at the trauma immediately,</p>
<p>at least most of the time we don&rsquo;t do that, right?</p>
<p>And we often don&rsquo;t explore it in depth,</p>
<p>like this idea that,</p>
<p>oh, that person now has to go through</p>
<p>every second of the trauma is actually not true.</p>
<p>I mean, sometimes it is,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not the common situation, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more often that person has to acknowledge,</p>
<p>like the example of like, I was sexually abused</p>
<p>and have to acknowledge that and say,</p>
<p>okay, like, gosh, what has that done to me?</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean, well, let&rsquo;s parse out every moment</p>
<p>of like how that was and the terror of that, right?</p>
<p>So that can lead people to a worse place, right?</p>
<p>So I think the idea of biting off small pieces,</p>
<p>so to speak, where a person is writing, right?</p>
<p>Or is talking, but I think if one is writing,</p>
<p>it is good to communicate with another, right?</p>
<p>Another trusted person.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s not someone in one&rsquo;s personal life,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;re clergy members.</p>
<p>Even if one isn&rsquo;t affiliated with an organized religion,</p>
<p>you could probably go places</p>
<p>and get a clergy to want to help you, right?</p>
<p>I mean, there are people out there</p>
<p>who want to help other people.</p>
<p>So we say, what if someone has no one?</p>
<p>I mean, almost never do we have no one here, right?</p>
<p>Because we could probably go find someone,</p>
<p>but we need to kind of take that in pieces.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some risk to trying to do the intensive thing,</p>
<p>you know, on one&rsquo;s own.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where I would put in,</p>
<p>if a person&rsquo;s having suicidal thoughts</p>
<p>or even thoughts of death, of not wanting to be alive,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t deserve to be alive.</p>
<p>I mean, these are warning signs for really getting help.</p>
<p>So there are some signs that say,</p>
<p>hey, don&rsquo;t try and do that on your own, right?</p>
<p>Go try and find a resource.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>things that get to that level of severity of,</p>
<p>and often a person knows that.</p>
<p>I mean, am I in a place where I know I&rsquo;m not healthy</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m having, you know, kind of scary thoughts,</p>
<p>then we need, that&rsquo;s a person</p>
<p>who really shouldn&rsquo;t be doing that on their own.</p>
<p>Great, thank you for that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve been talking a lot about talking.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;d like to talk a little bit about chemistry.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Drugs.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So maybe first we could talk prescription drugs.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re a psychiatrist,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re approved to,</p>
<p>and presumably do prescribe medication where appropriate.</p>
<p>And this is a vast landscape, of course.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got ADHD.</p>
<p>And I should just tell you,</p>
<p>I get more questions about ADHD</p>
<p>and the drugs related to ADHD and dopamine</p>
<p>than any other topic, any other topic.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s ADHD, there&rsquo;s OCD, there&rsquo;s depression,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s antidepressants and so forth.</p>
<p>Is there some way that we can, you know,</p>
<p>wrap our arms around all of that</p>
<p>as a way of wading into this drug question</p>
<p>and just address, you know,</p>
<p>how does one decide when medication is useful?</p>
<p>Because in the end, the dissection tool</p>
<p>that the psychiatrist or therapist has is language.</p>
<p>And at some point one has to make an assessment</p>
<p>about dopamine or serotonin</p>
<p>or whether or not a given drug would help.</p>
<p>And most therapies, I believe,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t involve putting someone in a brain scanner.</p>
<p>And to my knowledge,</p>
<p>there still is not a very good blood test to assess,</p>
<p>oh, is this person&rsquo;s dopamine low or high?</p>
<p>Correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>And ultimately that, and I know there are companies out there</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not trying to undermine those companies,</p>
<p>but if I happen to do that in this statement,</p>
<p>if you take a blood test</p>
<p>and find that your serotonin metabolites are low,</p>
<p>my understanding is it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>that you are too low in serotonin in the brain,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a very indirect window</p>
<p>into what&rsquo;s really going on.</p>
<p>So how do you think about prescription drugs</p>
<p>in the context of treating trauma and other conditions?</p>
<p>And then maybe we&rsquo;ll drill</p>
<p>into some of the more specific conditions.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I mean, I would first comment that, right,</p>
<p>there aren&rsquo;t tests for these things.</p>
<p>And I think the test for metabolites,</p>
<p>I mean, things are so different, you know,</p>
<p>by the time what we&rsquo;re talking about has been metabolized,</p>
<p>you know, often to some very significant extent,</p>
<p>left the brain, now it&rsquo;s in the peripheral blood</p>
<p>that we really don&rsquo;t learn from that.</p>
<p>And I think that we tend to over-utilize medicines</p>
<p>in this country because we have a healthcare system</p>
<p>that often it&rsquo;s so based on throughput</p>
<p>that we want to polish the hood</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a problem in the engine, right?</p>
<p>So we over-utilize medicines often as an endpoint, right?</p>
<p>Oh, we&rsquo;re going to make that person&rsquo;s depression better</p>
<p>with an antidepressant.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, maybe, right?</p>
<p>But most of the time it&rsquo;s for that person&rsquo;s depression</p>
<p>to really get better and stay better,</p>
<p>they need to unravel what&rsquo;s driving the depression, right?</p>
<p>So the first step is,</p>
<p>I think there are two steps to it, right?</p>
<p>The first assessment step is,</p>
<p>is there a diagnosis that the vast majority of the time,</p>
<p>if not sometimes all the time, really warrants a medicine?</p>
<p>So the bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right?</p>
<p>These are diagnoses that we understand more about them</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s going on in the brain</p>
<p>and how medicines can treat or stabilize them,</p>
<p>which doesn&rsquo;t mean the medicine is necessarily,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a substitute for therapy, right?</p>
<p>But sometimes the medicine and therapy can go hand in hand.</p>
<p>So for OCD, for example, warrants therapy,</p>
<p>but it almost, not always,</p>
<p>but it almost always warrants medicine too</p>
<p>so that you can ease the systems</p>
<p>that are making the rigidity and the repetition in the brain.</p>
<p>So the first kind of branch point can be,</p>
<p>what is the diagnosis?</p>
<p>What is the level of severity, right?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s very, very important.</p>
<p>Where I think it&rsquo;s a little more, maybe even interesting,</p>
<p>is using medicines to help the person engage in the therapy</p>
<p>as productively as possible.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s where I think we&rsquo;re so limited</p>
<p>by how we categorize medicines</p>
<p>and this sort of pharmaceutical,</p>
<p>insurance-driven medical system we have,</p>
<p>that I think throws us off in tremendous ways.</p>
<p>So you think about how medicines are categorized,</p>
<p>so antidepressants,</p>
<p>and the vast majority of people</p>
<p>who are helped by antidepressants,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have clinically severe depression, right?</p>
<p>Those medicines create more distress tolerance in us, right?</p>
<p>And if you think about how helpful that can be,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna go,</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re gonna do something difficult,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re gonna bring that trauma</p>
<p>or the stressors to the surface,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna process,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna try and make life change.</p>
<p>If we can make more distress tolerance in us,</p>
<p>that can be so, so much better, right?</p>
<p>And think about the category of medicines</p>
<p>that are called antipsychotics,</p>
<p>which really puts people off, right?</p>
<p>But most of the prescriptions for antipsychotics</p>
<p>are not for psychosis, right?</p>
<p>And there are ways in which low dosing</p>
<p>of some of those medicines</p>
<p>can help intervene in negative pathways, right?</p>
<p>In pathways that are about distress</p>
<p>and sending out those tendrils of neurons</p>
<p>that are about hypervigilance</p>
<p>and avoidance, right, in our brain.</p>
<p>And we can often get at that.</p>
<p>And if you can improve someone&rsquo;s distress tolerance,</p>
<p>and you can use medicines that take away</p>
<p>what clinically is rumination, right?</p>
<p>Not the standard meaning of that word,</p>
<p>but the clinical meaning of it,</p>
<p>where there are distress centers in our brain</p>
<p>that are overactive,</p>
<p>and then we get stuck</p>
<p>in these maladaptive negative pathways,</p>
<p>where we think about something</p>
<p>over and over and over again,</p>
<p>with no real chance of solving it,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s going on inside of us.</p>
<p>So medicines can help that,</p>
<p>but we have to have some flexibility</p>
<p>around their conception.</p>
<p>And the modern medical system</p>
<p>of 15-minute visits to a psychiatrist</p>
<p>that are weeks apart,</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t understand how that goes well, right?</p>
<p>In the vast majority of times,</p>
<p>I think it doesn&rsquo;t go well,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not enough time to do the therapy,</p>
<p>to even generate the understanding.</p>
<p>So then medicines get thrown at the person.</p>
<p>This is how we use,</p>
<p>I think approximately five times as much medicine,</p>
<p>I think across the board,</p>
<p>as say, the Dutch population, right?</p>
<p>They may go, why is five times more</p>
<p>is a lot more medicine, right?</p>
<p>And they have a healthcare system</p>
<p>and a cultural system</p>
<p>that to the best of my understanding</p>
<p>is more rooted in taking responsibility for oneself, right?</p>
<p>So if a person comes in and cholesterol is high, right?</p>
<p>The first order of business is,</p>
<p>hey, you could take better care of yourself, right?</p>
<p>Like this person really needs to lose some weight,</p>
<p>exercise more, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not just jumping to like,</p>
<p>let me give you a medicine</p>
<p>and shift you through the healthcare system</p>
<p>and out the other side of the door, right?</p>
<p>And the same thing is true in mental health.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not trying to be critical to the psychiatrists,</p>
<p>the nurse practitioners,</p>
<p>the people who are practicing in that way,</p>
<p>because oftentimes there is no choice, right?</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re working in a healthcare system</p>
<p>that the standard is highly spaced</p>
<p>or spaced apart 15 minute visits,</p>
<p>what alternative is there, right?</p>
<p>But to look at, okay, I&rsquo;m gonna use medicines</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t have another tool to bring to bear.</p>
<p>So I think the healthcare system</p>
<p>and its focus on throughput and its short-term talk about,</p>
<p>you know, we talk about short-term response, right?</p>
<p>There are short-term soothing</p>
<p>at the expense of long-term health.</p>
<p>And I think that is the metaphor</p>
<p>that applies to our healthcare system, right?</p>
<p>Where if we are gonna try and treat a symptom</p>
<p>in a short term, we&rsquo;re gonna do it in a 15 minute visit,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna do it in a way</p>
<p>that maybe it soothes the symptom, maybe it doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but it does not get at the problem.</p>
<p>We need to invest more resources to get at the problem.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s where a sort of protest,</p>
<p>you know, if people as a society,</p>
<p>we say, look, we don&rsquo;t like the way our healthcare is going.</p>
<p>Like we need more focus on what the actual problems are</p>
<p>that yes, we would spend more money,</p>
<p>treating people and taking care of people</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s more human time,</p>
<p>but ultimately less suffering, less death, right?</p>
<p>And ultimately more productivity.</p>
<p>I think as an economy, we would save so much money</p>
<p>if we spend money on the human aspects of mental healthcare</p>
<p>because people would be more functional.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re spending less time in the hospital, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re more productive when they&rsquo;re working.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s less entry into the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>So I think medicines get overused</p>
<p>in part for systemic reasons,</p>
<p>in large part for systemic reasons,</p>
<p>and also for some of these categorization reasons.</p>
<p>Oh, that person meets some technical criteria</p>
<p>for depression, we gotta give them this medicine</p>
<p>instead of really thinking,</p>
<p>wait, what&rsquo;s going on in this person?</p>
<p>And I see this over and over again.</p>
<p>I see someone who&rsquo;s on seven medicines</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re on seven medicines</p>
<p>to treat seven different symptoms.</p>
<p>And now they have side effects</p>
<p>from all those seven medicines.</p>
<p>Maybe two of them are to treat the side effects</p>
<p>from the other five, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s bad, right?</p>
<p>And if you really get at what&rsquo;s going on in them,</p>
<p>now they&rsquo;re doing much better</p>
<p>and maybe they&rsquo;re on two medicines, right?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s a helpful answer to that.</p>
<p>It is, it&rsquo;s a very helpful answer.</p>
<p>I mean, I think at least in the spheres</p>
<p>that I run these days,</p>
<p>I hear a lot of negative statements about antidepressants.</p>
<p>I think, you know, I&rsquo;m old enough to remember the book,</p>
<p>Listening to Prozac, and I remember when Prozac</p>
<p>and things like it first started showing up</p>
<p>and the excitement.</p>
<p>And then nowadays I hear more about the problems</p>
<p>with all these drugs, you know?</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s just because I have arms</p>
<p>in both the scientific,</p>
<p>but also in the kind of wellness community</p>
<p>where people think a lot about behavioral change.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I think that they do that.</p>
<p>But of course, these drugs, as you mentioned,</p>
<p>can have enormous utility as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to just pick up on one theme</p>
<p>that I haven&rsquo;t heard a lot about anywhere else,</p>
<p>which is the short-term versus the long-term use</p>
<p>of these drugs.</p>
<p>Because I could imagine, you know,</p>
<p>someone feeling like they&rsquo;re finally going to tackle</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s been inside them for a long time,</p>
<p>either because they&rsquo;re really struggling</p>
<p>or because they&rsquo;re just done with not working it through.</p>
<p>And they decide to start a medication</p>
<p>that would give them higher levels of distress tolerance</p>
<p>for a short while.</p>
<p>I mean, is there anything to say</p>
<p>that someone couldn&rsquo;t take a properly prescribed medication</p>
<p>for a week or for the first three months of the work,</p>
<p>and then know that they can come off it?</p>
<p>Because I think that the black and white model of,</p>
<p>okay, you&rsquo;re either going to start this drug</p>
<p>and stay on it forever,</p>
<p>or be taking some drugs forever,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re not going to take anything.</p>
<p>I mean, that just seems to,</p>
<p>life doesn&rsquo;t, does life have to work that way?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Is there a short-term use that can be effective?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely, yes.</p>
<p>Yes, in American medicine,</p>
<p>we are so much better at starting medicines</p>
<p>than we are at taking them away, right?</p>
<p>And part of that I think is driven</p>
<p>by such a strong presence of the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p>And the pharmaceutical industry</p>
<p>does a lot of very good things, right?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s such thing as too much of a good thing, right?</p>
<p>And then as a society, when something seems positive,</p>
<p>this I think also is human nature.</p>
<p>We can over-invest in it, right?</p>
<p>So you think about when Prozac</p>
<p>and those kinds of medicines came out,</p>
<p>they were safer medicines.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re billed as antidepressants.</p>
<p>And the thought was,</p>
<p>well, they&rsquo;re going to fix depression, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not how that works, right?</p>
<p>So if we look at them as tools, right,</p>
<p>then we can deploy them sometimes for the longer term,</p>
<p>because sometimes that&rsquo;s necessary,</p>
<p>but absolutely for the shorter term, I mean, absolutely.</p>
<p>If we thought of Prozac and those kinds of medicines,</p>
<p>not as, oh, they&rsquo;re antidepressants.</p>
<p>We thought, look, what they do is</p>
<p>they seem to make there be more serotonin</p>
<p>in certain circuits that are important for mood regulation,</p>
<p>anxiety regulation, distress tolerance.</p>
<p>So those medicines can really help somebody</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re very severely depressed</p>
<p>and we want to sort of get them feeling better.</p>
<p>They can also help someone</p>
<p>if they could use more distress tolerance</p>
<p>in a discrete period of time, right?</p>
<p>When we think about them that way,</p>
<p>we think about them as tools</p>
<p>that we could apply for short-term or long-term.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t see them as fixes, right?</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t see them as then substitutes</p>
<p>for the human-to-human work that needs to be done.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve been in sort of in my training at times</p>
<p>in healthcare systems,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve seen in many other circumstances</p>
<p>that look at medicines as answers</p>
<p>and this idea that, oh, that person is a,</p>
<p>and a lot of times there&rsquo;ll be a number, right?</p>
<p>The number is the diagnosis</p>
<p>and that number gets this medicine.</p>
<p>And like, I&rsquo;m not sure we could be more misguided than that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what leads to adding medicines,</p>
<p>adding medicines, it&rsquo;s not working.</p>
<p>Of course it&rsquo;s not working,</p>
<p>because no one&rsquo;s really paying attention to what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>So add more medicines and then medicines for the medicines.</p>
<p>And I mean, we know this is true.</p>
<p>We know this is true,</p>
<p>but we haven&rsquo;t had the wherewithal as a society to say,</p>
<p>like with a lot of things in society,</p>
<p>to say like, this isn&rsquo;t okay, right?</p>
<p>I mean, we need more,</p>
<p>like give these people who are trying to help us,</p>
<p>that they need more latitude to help us.</p>
<p>So we need more human-to-human contact</p>
<p>to get at what&rsquo;s really going on.</p>
<p>And yes, that&rsquo;s an investment of time and energy and money</p>
<p>in the short term.</p>
<p>And sometimes that&rsquo;s money from the systems, right?</p>
<p>But if we do that, my goodness,</p>
<p>look at the payoff of that.</p>
<p>What is your thought about anxiety and ADHD</p>
<p>as a separate phenomenon in terms of medication?</p>
<p>Again, ADHD is the thing</p>
<p>that seems to come up most in questions.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you the number of, especially students,</p>
<p>but also young working professionals,</p>
<p>and even people who are outside those categories</p>
<p>who are interested in or taking</p>
<p>Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil, Armodafinil, or Vyvanse</p>
<p>because they seem to struggle focusing without it,</p>
<p>or, and I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not one of those individuals,</p>
<p>or because they seem to just like how well they can focus</p>
<p>when they do take those compounds.</p>
<p>My understanding is these compounds</p>
<p>mainly increase dopaminergic transmission in the brain,</p>
<p>also adrenaline, epinephrine in the brain,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re more or less stimulants.</p>
<p>They look a lot like, at least chemically,</p>
<p>they look a lot like cocaine and amphetamine,</p>
<p>although they&rsquo;re not quite cocaine and amphetamine.</p>
<p>Should we be concerned about this?</p>
<p>Is this a different sort of epidemic?</p>
<p>Can these drugs be used to train the brain to focus,</p>
<p>and then people can withdraw from these drugs?</p>
<p>I think this is a huge topic</p>
<p>and one that maybe warrants its own episode entirely,</p>
<p>but as long as we&rsquo;re on the topic,</p>
<p>what are your thoughts about medication for ADHD?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I think medication for ADHD can be extremely effective,</p>
<p>and the studies show us that, right?</p>
<p>They show us that if there is ADD,</p>
<p>then medication for ADD is very, very helpful,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s true in youths.</p>
<p>It seems to be true if adults have adult ADHD or ADD.</p>
<p>Like, we kind of know that&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>but all attention deficit</p>
<p>is not attention deficit disorder, right?</p>
<p>And there we go to the reflexive 15-minute visits,</p>
<p>throw medicines at things, right?</p>
<p>Attention deficit can come from many, many places,</p>
<p>and one of them is anxiety, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many other reasons.</p>
<p>Depression affects attention.</p>
<p>Poor sleep affects attention.</p>
<p>Poor diet can affect attention.</p>
<p>Stress in life can affect attention.</p>
<p>So, and certainly trauma,</p>
<p>the problems that trauma spins off can affect attention.</p>
<p>So, this is really the truth</p>
<p>that while teaching once about medicines and pharmacology,</p>
<p>I was frustrated about how the answer to everything</p>
<p>was like, what medicine do we use?</p>
<p>What medicine do we use?</p>
<p>As opposed to like, this is just one piece of the puzzle,</p>
<p>and I told an anecdote,</p>
<p>which I think it was a clinical anecdote.</p>
<p>Like, what do you think is going on?</p>
<p>And I think that if I told that to,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, middle school students or something,</p>
<p>they would probably say,</p>
<p>you just told the story of a person</p>
<p>with a rock in their shoe,</p>
<p>which is the story that I was actually telling, right?</p>
<p>But several people I was talking to,</p>
<p>these are physicians, right, ADD, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no, every time the person steps down,</p>
<p>the rock hurts,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not able to maintain attention, right?</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re so programmed to think about medicines</p>
<p>and inappropriate use of ADD medicines.</p>
<p>As you said, there&rsquo;s dopaminergic impact,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s epinephrine, norepinephrine impact.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re affecting what are called</p>
<p>prefrontal alpha-2 receptors</p>
<p>that like really need to be helped if there&rsquo;s real ADD,</p>
<p>but if there isn&rsquo;t, that is not a good thing to do,</p>
<p>which is why it is quite fascinating</p>
<p>that when people have ADD,</p>
<p>they tolerate generally stimulants very well</p>
<p>without the other problems that can come of stimulants.</p>
<p>And again, I don&rsquo;t claim to know why that is,</p>
<p>but we see that phenomenon.</p>
<p>But when people are being treated for ADD</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t have ADD,</p>
<p>which sometimes they know they don&rsquo;t have ADD,</p>
<p>but the stimulants make them function better,</p>
<p>so they go to somebody and get the stimulants,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a good thing to do, right?</p>
<p>Because stimulants, when they&rsquo;re not needed over time,</p>
<p>they do affect our physical function,</p>
<p>they affect our judgment, right?</p>
<p>There are a lot of negative things that come from that.</p>
<p>They can affect the vigilance inside of us.</p>
<p>So, yes, it&rsquo;s a valid diagnosis,</p>
<p>but it gets made when it&rsquo;s not present,</p>
<p>very often, which we see with a lot of diagnoses</p>
<p>that you can throw medicine at.</p>
<p>We see the same thing with bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>True bipolar disorder is extremely important</p>
<p>to utilize medicines effectively,</p>
<p>but how many people are diagnosed with bipolar disorder</p>
<p>who have, they absolutely don&rsquo;t have bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>but it can be a catch-all diagnosis</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s, in a sense,</p>
<p>something to do for it, in quotes, right?</p>
<p>And you can throw medicine at it, right?</p>
<p>So, I mean, what do we expect, right?</p>
<p>If we have a healthcare system</p>
<p>where you get 15-minute visits with your psychiatrist,</p>
<p>of course, we&rsquo;re going to throw medicines at everything.</p>
<p>And then the training paradigms,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to look at it through that lens.</p>
<p>And then very often, again,</p>
<p>I give the example of seeing somebody on seven medicines.</p>
<p>I mean, the first thought I have is</p>
<p>how many of those medicines are actually counterproductive?</p>
<p>And a lot of the time, it&rsquo;s not like,</p>
<p>oh, every now and then one is counterproductive.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the case a lot of the time.</p>
<p>And again, I come back to,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re not putting thought into it,</p>
<p>what other result would we expect?</p>
<p>Thank you for that answer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very curious what constitutes</p>
<p>negative effects of stimulants.</p>
<p>So if somebody&rsquo;s taking Adderall or Ritalin</p>
<p>in order to work longer hours or focus</p>
<p>because they have attention deficit,</p>
<p>but not necessarily ADHD,</p>
<p>and again, I&rsquo;m not recommending anyone do this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just heard the numbers that have come back,</p>
<p>at least from surveys and discussions</p>
<p>with colleagues at Stanford and elsewhere,</p>
<p>other college campuses,</p>
<p>upwards of 75% of college students</p>
<p>use semi-regularly these drugs off,</p>
<p>not by prescription, just to study and to learn.</p>
<p>I can imagine sleep issues because these are stimulants.</p>
<p>What sorts of other issues can they create for people?</p>
<p>Problems that they can create?</p>
<p>I think a touchstone maybe</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s running through our conversation</p>
<p>is prioritizing the short-term benefit</p>
<p>over solving a long-term problem,</p>
<p>which we might say is a human tendency,</p>
<p>and we see it across the topics that we&rsquo;re discussing.</p>
<p>So short-term use of stimulants,</p>
<p>people are more alert.</p>
<p>They can stay awake more.</p>
<p>They can study more intensely and longer.</p>
<p>Okay, there&rsquo;s some short-term benefit of that.</p>
<p>Over there, even there, there can be problems, right?</p>
<p>But we can say, let&rsquo;s just say for sake of argument</p>
<p>that in the short term,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something to be gained by doing that, right?</p>
<p>But, oh my goodness, there&rsquo;s so much risk to that.</p>
<p>And how many times have I seen someone</p>
<p>who they&rsquo;re doing that</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just doing that to study, right?</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;re addicted to the amphetamines</p>
<p>and their behavior changes and they don&rsquo;t know it.</p>
<p>Talk about shifting our brain towards a more defensive,</p>
<p>sort of suspicious, outward look, view of the world</p>
<p>that we see a lot of that.</p>
<p>So we see judgment impairment.</p>
<p>We see heightened levels of anxiety.</p>
<p>We see more impulsivity in decision-making.</p>
<p>And sometimes we can get to the point</p>
<p>of seeing frank psychosis.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s not common,</p>
<p>but have I seen young people</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve done exactly what you&rsquo;re describing, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re using Adderall or they&rsquo;re using Ritalin to study.</p>
<p>And then I see them when they&rsquo;re coming into the hospital,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re screaming about how someone&rsquo;s trying to hurt them.</p>
<p>Boy, then it&rsquo;s the worst case scenario,</p>
<p>but it shows like that&rsquo;s where that can go.</p>
<p>And how much is there between the,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m just using it to study</p>
<p>and that severe outcome</p>
<p>that is actually quite negative for a person.</p>
<p>It might change how they think about that friendship</p>
<p>or that relationship, right?</p>
<p>A lot negative happens when we change our brains</p>
<p>without an ability to see,</p>
<p>like what is it actually doing to us?</p>
<p>Which is part of my whole theme about trauma, right?</p>
<p>It changes our brains and we don&rsquo;t know it, right?</p>
<p>Well, the same is often true</p>
<p>of amphetamines used inappropriately.</p>
<p>It shifts our brain and we don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re a little bit more impulsive</p>
<p>in our decision-making, a little bit less trusting.</p>
<p>These are significant negative things</p>
<p>that if we don&rsquo;t know it,</p>
<p>person will just say, oh, I&rsquo;m just using it to study.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using it to work more.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not without its high level of risk.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on cannabis?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it many times on this podcast</p>
<p>before I&rsquo;ll say it again.</p>
<p>I feel fortunate that I&rsquo;ve never really been attracted</p>
<p>to alcohol or drugs of any kind</p>
<p>in so much so that if all the alcohol</p>
<p>and all the marijuana</p>
<p>and all the cocaine and amphetamine disappeared,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t notice any change in my life, right?</p>
<p>And I feel lucky in that way</p>
<p>because I know a lot of people feel an attraction</p>
<p>to these things as almost a gravitational force</p>
<p>from their first drink, they just feel.</p>
<p>I once heard it described in this,</p>
<p>I think it was in Guston Burroughs&rsquo; book,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dry&rsquo; where he was an alcoholic.</p>
<p>He said that the first drink he had,</p>
<p>it felt like this magic elixir</p>
<p>that meshed with the physiology of his blood</p>
<p>in the most seamless way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as I was reading this, I thought, oh my goodness.</p>
<p>First of all, that&rsquo;s the most foreign experience for me</p>
<p>in terms of alcohol.</p>
<p>And second, gosh, that must be terrible.</p>
<p>But at the same time,</p>
<p>you could really understand</p>
<p>why someone would be drawn to that.</p>
<p>So cannabis nowadays is legal</p>
<p>or decriminalized in many areas of the US.</p>
<p>A lot of people seem to use the argument,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s better than drinking</p>
<p>or they only do it for sleep or anxiety management.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not looking to demonize or support the cannabis.</p>
<p>So what are your thoughts about cannabis</p>
<p>for anxiety management, depression,</p>
<p>and maybe even for ADHD for that matter?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>If I could make an alcohol comment, right?</p>
<p>The number of times I&rsquo;ve seen alcohol,</p>
<p>like having been a good idea for coping with something,</p>
<p>it approaches zero, right?</p>
<p>The alcohol for coping is just never good.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an additional risk factor</p>
<p>that there are certain genetic profiles</p>
<p>where people respond strongly to alcohol.</p>
<p>Like as you&rsquo;re saying, it&rsquo;s not just,</p>
<p>oh, there&rsquo;s a little bit of short-term relief of distress,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a sort of euphoric response.</p>
<p>And those genetics, we don&rsquo;t understand them completely.</p>
<p>They seem to be in Northern European populations,</p>
<p>more prevalent as you had West in Northern Europe.</p>
<p>So we understand that where risk factors are demographically</p>
<p>but we can&rsquo;t pinpoint that for any one person.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a tremendous risk of that</p>
<p>when a person responds so strongly to alcohol</p>
<p>or habituates coping to alcohol.</p>
<p>Cannabis is a little bit of a different story.</p>
<p>I mean, how I have seen that play out,</p>
<p>and again, this isn&rsquo;t coming from any expertise</p>
<p>around the neuropharmacology of it,</p>
<p>like how is this really working in the brain?</p>
<p>It comes from an observation that what it seems to do</p>
<p>is to narrow our attentional perspective, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s why people will say, well, they want to use cannabis</p>
<p>before watching a movie with friends or something, right?</p>
<p>And I think, okay, I think why people are doing that</p>
<p>is because our cognitive spectrum narrows.</p>
<p>And then instead of worrying about that thing at work</p>
<p>or that relationship issue, one can just be present, right?</p>
<p>For it gates out other attentional intrusions, right?</p>
<p>So in some ways, I mean, I&rsquo;ve absolutely seen it</p>
<p>be helpful to people.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s been legalized in Oregon,</p>
<p>which is where I spend a lot of my time,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not where all of my practice is.</p>
<p>But what I have seen is it is at times helpful,</p>
<p>say around sleep, right?</p>
<p>Because a person can gate out other intrusive thoughts</p>
<p>and they can just relax and go to sleep.</p>
<p>But there can be another side of that too,</p>
<p>that at higher levels of distress,</p>
<p>at higher levels of tension,</p>
<p>what it can do is narrow the focus of cognition</p>
<p>to the thing that is negative, right?</p>
<p>So the idea that, oh, this is a treatment for depression,</p>
<p>anxiety, trauma is not true, right?</p>
<p>Can it be helpful under certain circumstances?</p>
<p>Like, I think the answer to that is yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I know the answer to that is yes,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve seen it play out clinically that way,</p>
<p>but it can also be harmful too.</p>
<p>So there again, like anything that has any power,</p>
<p>power to influence our brains,</p>
<p>we want to be thoughtful and careful about it.</p>
<p>I mean, do I think that it&rsquo;s safer than alcohol?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I mean, I think we so clearly see that.</p>
<p>Does that mean it was just uniformly safe?</p>
<p>No, right?</p>
<p>So we want to be respectful of anything</p>
<p>that can change how our brain is working.</p>
<p>And I think that includes, certainly includes alcohol,</p>
<p>and I think it certainly includes cannabis too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to talk about psychedelics for two reasons.</p>
<p>One, there seems to be a tremendous amount of interest</p>
<p>in psychedelics as a therapeutic clinical tool.</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s also recreational use,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll just preface all this by saying that my stance is</p>
<p>we absolutely know for sure</p>
<p>that these are controlled substances.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re illegal to possess, sell, or use</p>
<p>in most of the country.</p>
<p>There are a few areas where they are decriminalized.</p>
<p>And psychedelics is a broad category, of course,</p>
<p>and we can touch on some of the different ones.</p>
<p>But whereas five years or so,</p>
<p>five years ago or so,</p>
<p>I was truly afraid to say the word psychedelics</p>
<p>in any kind of public venue.</p>
<p>There are laboratories at Stanford</p>
<p>working on ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA,</p>
<p>mostly in animal models.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s terrific work going on</p>
<p>at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine</p>
<p>and Matthew Johnson&rsquo;s lab and others</p>
<p>looking at the clinical applications,</p>
<p>mainly of high-dose psilocybin and LSD.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the MAPS trials with MDMA.</p>
<p>So nowadays it&rsquo;s safe for an academic like me</p>
<p>to say the word psychedelics,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d love to approach this question of psychedelics</p>
<p>from a place of true exploration and curiosity,</p>
<p>but with the preface that we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>this in a legal clinical setting.</p>
<p>And the legality is something that&rsquo;s now in process.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s completed,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s my understanding.</p>
<p>But there are trials.</p>
<p>You can go to clinicaltrials.gov and put in MDMA</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll see a bunch of clinical trials</p>
<p>that are happening in the recruiting subjects.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s safe to have the conversation now,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d love your thoughts about psychedelics.</p>
<p>Maybe we could start with psilocybin and LSD</p>
<p>as a broad category of drugs</p>
<p>that at least my understanding is they touch on</p>
<p>mainly the serotonin system,</p>
<p>some specific receptor activation and modulation,</p>
<p>tend to change notions of space and time,</p>
<p>adjust internal state.</p>
<p>Maybe we could start there</p>
<p>and then maybe venture into some of the other ones.</p>
<p>So what are your thoughts on these drugs</p>
<p>for a therapeutic potential,</p>
<p>also potential hazards, et cetera?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think if we look at the true psychedelics,</p>
<p>so psilocybin and LSD, because ketamine and MDMA,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re different categories of medicine.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re these sort of novel tools to bring to bear.</p>
<p>But if we start with psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics,</p>
<p>I think why they have gained so much momentum</p>
<p>over the last several years</p>
<p>is because the data coming from the labs</p>
<p>and the academic centers is so powerfully positive.</p>
<p>And as someone who&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in anything that&rsquo;s potentially helpful,</p>
<p>and I want to learn and understand that</p>
<p>because a lot of things that are potentially helpful,</p>
<p>you go and look at the data</p>
<p>and you see that that&rsquo;s not helpful or that&rsquo;s harmful.</p>
<p>I think what we have seen with psychedelics</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;re so helpful,</p>
<p>and the trials are bearing that out.</p>
<p>And of course, these are used in professional hands</p>
<p>and with the right kind of guidance</p>
<p>or extremely powerful tools,</p>
<p>but used in the right way</p>
<p>by someone who knows how to utilize them</p>
<p>in the right set and setting</p>
<p>can have an immense positive impact.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think that the thought is there</p>
<p>across people and more and more people feel comfortable</p>
<p>saying it and talking about it.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re in the state of Oregon now</p>
<p>where the thought is we&rsquo;re moving towards legalization</p>
<p>of psilocybin early in 2023.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s part of the new data, right?</p>
<p>And how it meshes with the older data, right?</p>
<p>How it meshes with data from the 60s and 70s</p>
<p>that showed such a strong, powerful impact</p>
<p>of these medicines.</p>
<p>And I have a whole set of thoughts</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s happening there.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re just, they&rsquo;re conjectures, right?</p>
<p>But my read of, you know,</p>
<p>as best I can try and understand the neuroscience</p>
<p>and the clinical applicability and the changes</p>
<p>is, you know, what happens is we see less communication</p>
<p>or less chatter in the outer parts of the brain, right?</p>
<p>In the outer parts of the cortex.</p>
<p>And I think that as human beings,</p>
<p>we sort of glorify the parts of the brain</p>
<p>that only we have.</p>
<p>I mean, certainly in my growing up, right?</p>
<p>I mean, what did I learn?</p>
<p>Even if you think about like learning about the brain</p>
<p>in high school, right?</p>
<p>I learned that like, wow, we&rsquo;re great as humans</p>
<p>because we have language and other animals don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>and we can use tools and like, aren&rsquo;t we so great</p>
<p>because we have this part of the brain</p>
<p>that other animals don&rsquo;t and it lets us function, right?</p>
<p>Okay, there&rsquo;s some truth to that, right?</p>
<p>That we can do things others can&rsquo;t do,</p>
<p>but we get lost often in the outer parts of the cortex,</p>
<p>which I think are about survival, right?</p>
<p>So we come back to the things you and I talked about</p>
<p>early on of like, why are these trauma mechanisms in us?</p>
<p>Right, so much of what&rsquo;s going on in our brains</p>
<p>is about survival.</p>
<p>And I think living, so to speak, in the cortex, right?</p>
<p>In the outer part of the brain</p>
<p>is consistent with a focus on survival.</p>
<p>So if you think that&rsquo;s where language is,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where vision is, that&rsquo;s where executive function is.</p>
<p>So planning and task execution.</p>
<p>So, so much of that is about making our way</p>
<p>in the world around us.</p>
<p>So we tend to glorify that and think, well,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in a sense where our existence is, right?</p>
<p>And I believe that is not true, right?</p>
<p>And again, can I say that for sure?</p>
<p>Of course not, right?</p>
<p>But my read of 20 years of doing clinical work</p>
<p>and thinking about all sorts of medicines</p>
<p>and thinking about the psychedelics in a lot of depth,</p>
<p>I think that what they do is they take us</p>
<p>out of the cortex, right?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s where we run into these problems.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where we bounce things over and over again,</p>
<p>that the distress centers deep in our brain,</p>
<p>in the brainstem, kind of ally</p>
<p>with the outer parts of the cortex.</p>
<p>And they say, right, we&rsquo;re in distress,</p>
<p>we wanna stay alive.</p>
<p>Often a lot of us have had trauma</p>
<p>that makes these changes in the brain.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re thinking all the time,</p>
<p>like what would I do if there were war?</p>
<p>What would I do if there&rsquo;s civil war,</p>
<p>if someone bombs us?</p>
<p>What will I do if the economy collapses, right?</p>
<p>What will I do if somebody gets sick?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re thinking all this future projection</p>
<p>that is all coming from a place of fear, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all coming from a desire to think about things</p>
<p>and control the future with this part of the brain</p>
<p>that is so uniquely human, right?</p>
<p>And I think when we take the neurotransmission</p>
<p>out of those places, right,</p>
<p>and we set it in a part of the brain</p>
<p>and say the insular cortex, right?</p>
<p>The parts of the brain that are sort of in the middle,</p>
<p>right, which I think, I believe,</p>
<p>is where our humanness really is.</p>
<p>So the psychedelics make there be less chatter,</p>
<p>communication in these other parts of the brain,</p>
<p>and then we become seated in the part of the brain</p>
<p>that I believe is most about our experience</p>
<p>of true humanness,</p>
<p>which is why when you read about people</p>
<p>who have experiences, and I&rsquo;ve heard about them,</p>
<p>people talk to me about this, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve utilized it, they talk with me.</p>
<p>So whether it&rsquo;s someone telling me their story</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s coming from research data,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s why people can sort of see with clarity</p>
<p>that, oh, that trauma, like that thing is not my fault,</p>
<p>right, like we feel a sense of compassion for ourselves.</p>
<p>We relieve ourselves, release ourselves from guilt</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, why is this so helpful to people?</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s because it can do</p>
<p>what we are trying to get at in good therapy,</p>
<p>but it can really catalyze that</p>
<p>by just putting a person in that part of the brain</p>
<p>that can see it for what it is</p>
<p>without all that chatter in the cortex</p>
<p>about how you gotta think it&rsquo;s your fault</p>
<p>or you won&rsquo;t avoid it again</p>
<p>and that makes the repetition compulsion.</p>
<p>How do I think ahead to the next thing that might happen</p>
<p>and what else bad might happen?</p>
<p>I mean, we don&rsquo;t get anywhere doing that.</p>
<p>And I think where we get somewhere</p>
<p>is when we seed ourselves deeper in the brain,</p>
<p>which I think we do if we&rsquo;re like doing really good therapy</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re in the deep parts of the brain,</p>
<p>but these psychedelics and medicinal value,</p>
<p>I believe is putting us in that part of the brain</p>
<p>where a person can really find truth.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think that it&rsquo;s come so far</p>
<p>in these few years</p>
<p>because I think that is very clinically evident</p>
<p>and I think we&rsquo;re gonna see more and more</p>
<p>of the value of that</p>
<p>and how what the psychedelics do can become,</p>
<p>I believe, a heuristic for understanding like,</p>
<p>wait, how are our brains really functioning</p>
<p>and what are the parts that really matter</p>
<p>to our experience of being human?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s those parts of the brain, right?</p>
<p>The deep parts of the brain,</p>
<p>the insular cortex and the areas around it</p>
<p>that say light up when a person has</p>
<p>an experience of spiritual ecstasy</p>
<p>or an experience of connection with another person, right?</p>
<p>So we kind of have these telltale markers</p>
<p>that something is going on there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very important and very special.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re more attracted</p>
<p>to the outer parts of the brain</p>
<p>in part because they&rsquo;re easier to study, right?</p>
<p>I mean, as you know better than I do,</p>
<p>we started studying the brain through lesion studies, right?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s easier to see if a person got hurt</p>
<p>in this part of the brain</p>
<p>or had a stroke in that part of the brain, what changes.</p>
<p>So we look at the cortex because one, it&rsquo;s easier to study</p>
<p>and we tend to glorify it.</p>
<p>And I think that has been misguided.</p>
<p>And I think that we&rsquo;re learning</p>
<p>about how that&rsquo;s been misguided</p>
<p>through the study of these novel modalities</p>
<p>from Western perspectives,</p>
<p>but of course they&rsquo;ve been used for a long, long time</p>
<p>in other cultures, but novel from our perspective.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m fascinated by this idea</p>
<p>that in these middle brain structures</p>
<p>is where our humanity lies.</p>
<p>And as you said, I also wonder whether or not</p>
<p>other animals experience life more from that orientation</p>
<p>with less chatter.</p>
<p>We can only guess, but the dog lover</p>
<p>and being in the presence of animals</p>
<p>that seem to just be present in what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in their immediate environment,</p>
<p>not too much anticipation.</p>
<p>Right, I mean, what you&rsquo;re talking about is sentience</p>
<p>is important and sentience is extremely important, right?</p>
<p>And if we&rsquo;re going to overvalue say language,</p>
<p>then I think we undervalue sentience, right?</p>
<p>Which is why I think we tend to undervalue animals, right?</p>
<p>And their suffering because, well,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not saying anything about it, right?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not writing about it.</p>
<p>So, okay, it&rsquo;s easy to ignore.</p>
<p>And we think about, again, the hubris of that, right?</p>
<p>That, oh, because we can think and talk and write,</p>
<p>like we must be feeling more</p>
<p>than species that don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that that is so true</p>
<p>and that we&rsquo;re gonna understand more</p>
<p>about sentience in other species</p>
<p>and how that&rsquo;s at the core of existence.</p>
<p>And my hope would be that we value more humans</p>
<p>and animals, right,</p>
<p>through the evolution of that understanding.</p>
<p>The hallucinations that accompany psychedelics</p>
<p>like LSD and psilocybin</p>
<p>have such an attractive force to them</p>
<p>as a concept and as an experience.</p>
<p>And so I think most often when people hear hallucinogens,</p>
<p>they think in psychedelics, they think about hallucinating.</p>
<p>It makes sense why they would.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s so interesting to me is nothing in your answer</p>
<p>about psychedelics, psilocybin and LSD</p>
<p>focused on hallucinations per se.</p>
<p>It was more about feeling states, accessing a feeling state</p>
<p>or a relation to an event or to a person or to oneself.</p>
<p>Maybe even I caught hints of maybe even empathy for oneself</p>
<p>for the first time.</p>
<p>None of that had to do with seeing sounds</p>
<p>or hearing colors and these kind of cliche statements</p>
<p>about hallucinations.</p>
<p>So I am aware of laboratories,</p>
<p>one at University of California Davis in particular,</p>
<p>but a few others that are trying to generate</p>
<p>chemical variants of psychedelics</p>
<p>that lack the hallucinogenic properties,</p>
<p>but maintain these other properties as therapeutic tools.</p>
<p>And as I say that,</p>
<p>I realize that people in the psychedelic community</p>
<p>are probably thinking, oh, that&rsquo;s horrible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the dismantling of the core thing.</p>
<p>But the simple question is,</p>
<p>do you think the hallucinations are valuable for anything?</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re really getting into the philosophical,</p>
<p>the ontological, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this sort of trying to understand being, right?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t claim to know the answer to that.</p>
<p>I think that at times it seems like the hallucinations</p>
<p>have a metaphorical or a symbolic way of being helpful,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Because people will come to understand things</p>
<p>that they hold dear and true after the experience, right?</p>
<p>That often, not always,</p>
<p>come through the lens of the hallucination.</p>
<p>So are the hallucinations necessary?</p>
<p>Are those hallucinations sometimes important, sometimes not?</p>
<p>I mean, I think we don&rsquo;t understand that.</p>
<p>And I think we want to be respectful</p>
<p>of the sort of mystery of that.</p>
<p>But what I think is fascinating is,</p>
<p>you think about substance abuse and what that means is,</p>
<p>well, one aspect of that is that a person</p>
<p>has experiences, thoughts, conceptions of self in the world</p>
<p>with the substance that without the substance,</p>
<p>they know are wrong, right?</p>
<p>People talk about liquid courage, right?</p>
<p>And okay, I feel better about myself and I feel courageous</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve had a couple of drinks.</p>
<p>Now, after that, I feel normal about myself</p>
<p>and that was false, right?</p>
<p>And we see that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of what substance intoxication means, right?</p>
<p>But what we see with the psychedelic medicines</p>
<p>is something that&rsquo;s incredibly different, right?</p>
<p>That people are having experiences that are so de-linked</p>
<p>from our normal experience of reality.</p>
<p>And then when they come in a sense back online,</p>
<p>with in a normal cognitive way,</p>
<p>they realize like, wow, now I&rsquo;m applying</p>
<p>all those mechanisms of trying to understand truth</p>
<p>and to that and what I see is that it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And wow, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, we hear that all the time,</p>
<p>which tells me, hey, something different is going on there.</p>
<p>And of course these are powerful tools.</p>
<p>So misused, like very bad things can happen.</p>
<p>But you think about the clinical utility</p>
<p>and what does it mean that so many people</p>
<p>change for the healthier or even change their lives</p>
<p>after an experience because it so resonates as like,</p>
<p>oh, now I understand something that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not something bizarre.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I wasn&rsquo;t responsible for being raped that time.</p>
<p>Or, you know, I&rsquo;m not less than</p>
<p>even though my sexuality or my gender identity</p>
<p>is different from some silly binary concept, right?</p>
<p>Like people kind of can often get it</p>
<p>and they feel differently about themselves</p>
<p>and guilt and shame are impacted.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;re likely to see</p>
<p>that they are powerful anti-trauma mechanisms,</p>
<p>again, used clinically in the right hands.</p>
<p>And I think that we&rsquo;re also gonna see</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re a heuristic for understanding our brain</p>
<p>that goes against what I see</p>
<p>as some of the reflexive hubris of,</p>
<p>well, the outer parts must be the best</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what makes us human</p>
<p>and other animals don&rsquo;t have it</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re better because we&rsquo;re human.</p>
<p>I mean, it makes no sense, you know?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to talk about MDMA.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll preface this by saying I was a participant,</p>
<p>actually, technically, I&rsquo;m still a participant</p>
<p>in a clinical trial.</p>
<p>So I have experience of doing it twice.</p>
<p>The trial involves three separate dosings of this.</p>
<p>I was reluctant to do it outside of a clinical trial</p>
<p>most because I was aware</p>
<p>there can be some cardiac effects</p>
<p>and I liked the idea there&rsquo;d be a clinician on hand.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll just say that I found the experiences</p>
<p>to be profound, beneficial,</p>
<p>and very different from one session to the next.</p>
<p>The first one felt a whole collection of ideas</p>
<p>and relational things came up</p>
<p>that felt very powerful and transformative.</p>
<p>And I do think that I learned there.</p>
<p>I exported a number of things.</p>
<p>My particular experience isn&rsquo;t relevant here,</p>
<p>but the second time I expected it to be the same way</p>
<p>and it was very mellow and relaxing</p>
<p>and was deeply tied to kind of notions of acceptance.</p>
<p>So there weren&rsquo;t all these revelations and wow, new insights.</p>
<p>It was very much about sort of grounding</p>
<p>into a kind of a calmer state.</p>
<p>So I have the personal experience of benefiting from these</p>
<p>in ways that I think still benefit me</p>
<p>and was very struck by the power of MDMA.</p>
<p>And my very crude understanding of the pharmacology</p>
<p>and the state that is being under MDMA</p>
<p>is that it encourages or increases</p>
<p>dopaminergic transmission,</p>
<p>but also serotonergic transmission,</p>
<p>which is to my knowledge,</p>
<p>a kind of a rare state for the brain to be in.</p>
<p>That typically it&rsquo;s more of a seesaw</p>
<p>of dopaminergic drive towards external goals</p>
<p>or more serotonergic drive towards more placidity</p>
<p>or comfort with what one already has.</p>
<p>And so with both those systems amplified,</p>
<p>the only way I can describe it subjectively</p>
<p>is that everything sort of funneled back in</p>
<p>and it was almost like a pursuit of inner landscape.</p>
<p>And I can only imagine what it would be like</p>
<p>in the context of doing this with somebody else,</p>
<p>also taking MDMA.</p>
<p>I have no idea what that&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my report of the experience.</p>
<p>I know that the experience can vary.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about the chemistry</p>
<p>and what sorts of states do you think MDMA is creating</p>
<p>that can explain why it&rsquo;s a useful therapeutic tool</p>
<p>in some cases and what sorts of cases those might be?</p>
<p>Sure, sure.</p>
<p>To clarify, I think part of what we&rsquo;re starting with</p>
<p>is like this is very different than the psychedelics, right?</p>
<p>Which are seeding our consciousness</p>
<p>in these deep centers of the brain, right?</p>
<p>Whereas what MDMA is doing is sort of flooding</p>
<p>with positive neurotransmitters, right?</p>
<p>In certain parts of the brain.</p>
<p>And I think what that creates</p>
<p>is a greater permissiveness inside</p>
<p>to entertain or approach different things, right?</p>
<p>So I think where we see it&rsquo;s tremend,</p>
<p>my read of the data is around potentially,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re seeing in some of the trials, right?</p>
<p>Tremendous benefit for trauma, right?</p>
<p>And you think about what we were talking about earlier,</p>
<p>how this reflexive guilt, shame,</p>
<p>hypervigilance, avoidance, right?</p>
<p>And when these systems are flooded</p>
<p>with these neurotransmitters,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more permissive to think about that, right?</p>
<p>And to think about that without, again,</p>
<p>all the chatter of that&rsquo;s your fault,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re never gonna get anywhere because of that,</p>
<p>or you know what that means, right?</p>
<p>They can kind of go away and then we can think about it</p>
<p>in a way that isn&rsquo;t through the lens of fear, right?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the power there</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s permissive of approaching something</p>
<p>or contemplating something, you know, a different,</p>
<p>a novelty, as we talk about a de novo approach.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s also why the experience can vary</p>
<p>because you could also see how</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not thinking about something, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s not a clinical guidance to it.</p>
<p>You could be in a state where like,</p>
<p>I just feel good, right?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m thinking about good things</p>
<p>and like that can feel good, right?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not necessarily problem solving, right?</p>
<p>So the clinical guidance says,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take that state and do something with it, right?</p>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;re in this state, let&rsquo;s, hey,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s make cable, the sun is shining, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in a state where we can look at things</p>
<p>that are traumatic, right?</p>
<p>We can approach them from a de novo perspective.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s part,</p>
<p>I think that explains why you had these different experiences</p>
<p>from one to the other,</p>
<p>because your brain is just in a state</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s conducive to something, right?</p>
<p>But if there&rsquo;s not the mechanism to have that thing happen,</p>
<p>like conducive to something therapeutic,</p>
<p>then you might go there on your own</p>
<p>or you might just be in a state</p>
<p>where you have a sense of wellbeing and you sit with that.</p>
<p>Which sort of seems like a waste to me.</p>
<p>I mean, this is what I tell people</p>
<p>when they ask about MDMA.</p>
<p>I said, at least from my experience,</p>
<p>that the potential hazard there</p>
<p>is that in that very high dopaminergic, serotonergic state,</p>
<p>there were moments where I felt like I could get excited</p>
<p>about any one specific concept</p>
<p>that I might even just think about, for instance,</p>
<p>water and how nourishing it is</p>
<p>and really just go down the path of water</p>
<p>and the world and all the water.</p>
<p>And you can, you&rsquo;re in a state</p>
<p>that is very prone to suggestion, internal suggestion.</p>
<p>And so the guidance turned out,</p>
<p>the guidance from the clinician turned out</p>
<p>to be immensely valuable</p>
<p>in allowing me to go into my own head for bits of time,</p>
<p>but then also to resurface and share and exchange</p>
<p>in a way that to,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to really get something out of it</p>
<p>that was useful and that I could export.</p>
<p>Because of course, water is wonderful,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not really interested</p>
<p>in growing my relationship to water.</p>
<p>And I really felt like I could understand for the,</p>
<p>I never went to raves or anything growing up.</p>
<p>I never did MDMA recreationally,</p>
<p>but I understood for the first time</p>
<p>how people could get really attached to an environment</p>
<p>and feel connected to things,</p>
<p>because I think with all that serotonin,</p>
<p>you just feel connected to everything around you.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s a slippery slope there.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what the future</p>
<p>of the clinical use of MDMA looks like,</p>
<p>but I would hope that whoever&rsquo;s thinking about</p>
<p>guiding these sessions is really thinking carefully</p>
<p>also about evolving the practice</p>
<p>to help people really move through in a sequential way</p>
<p>so they can leave with something valuable.</p>
<p>Yes, 100%, 100%.</p>
<p>These are such powerful tools.</p>
<p>And again, if they&rsquo;re powerful tools</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re using them without respect for them, right?</p>
<p>Without clinical guidance, we incur risk, right?</p>
<p>I mean, getting obsessed with water,</p>
<p>well, and it probably isn&rsquo;t gonna hurt you, right?</p>
<p>But if someone is out using it around other people,</p>
<p>what one can feel positively about</p>
<p>or become sort of obsessed in the short term about</p>
<p>can be very counterproductive, right?</p>
<p>There can be a lot of risk to that.</p>
<p>So I think it anchors back to,</p>
<p>these are very powerful tools.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re coming to understand them much, much more.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re coming to understand</p>
<p>that they have immense potential to be helpful to us.</p>
<p>But I think and hope that that only also increases</p>
<p>our respect for those modalities and what can come,</p>
<p>what negative can happen if we&rsquo;re not respectful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be very interesting</p>
<p>to see where all of this goes in the next few years,</p>
<p>not just in Oregon, but elsewhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one way or another, it&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>It seems to have a momentum that is not going to stop.</p>
<p>So very exciting area to be sure.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I have a question about language.</p>
<p>In your book, you talk about how we need to be careful</p>
<p>about the use of language around trauma,</p>
<p>maybe problem solving and problem describing in general.</p>
<p>At one extreme, you hear that your brain and your body</p>
<p>hear every word you say,</p>
<p>and we have to be so careful with language.</p>
<p>And that actually frightened me for a number of years</p>
<p>because I would hear that and I thought, gosh,</p>
<p>if I just think that something is bad,</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s gonna hurt me worse,</p>
<p>which itself is part of that whole packing down of an issue.</p>
<p>Very hard to avoid thoughts.</p>
<p>Without distraction.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one extreme.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I can say,</p>
<p>I can tell somebody I love them with a tone of hatred.</p>
<p>I can tell somebody I hate them with a tone of love.</p>
<p>So how should we think about language in parsing trauma?</p>
<p>And in your book, you talk about,</p>
<p>you give some cautionary notes</p>
<p>about talking about depression, trauma, and PTSD</p>
<p>in terms that might diminish their real severity</p>
<p>in some cases.</p>
<p>And I was really struck by that.</p>
<p>So maybe just touch on,</p>
<p>how should we talk about these things in a way</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t diminish them for ourselves</p>
<p>or for other people?</p>
<p>And at the same time, honors the fact that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of trauma out there</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of depression out there</p>
<p>and we need to talk about it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think this is a very complicated</p>
<p>and in many ways, convoluted topic.</p>
<p>Like I think it&rsquo;s wonderful that we have language,</p>
<p>but boy, language leads us astray often too.</p>
<p>You think about how people define words.</p>
<p>Like someone says a word,</p>
<p>what is it?</p>
<p>Does a person know what that word means?</p>
<p>What nuance are they taking from it?</p>
<p>We just have to be very careful</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re saying and what we&rsquo;re communicating.</p>
<p>And I think this doesn&rsquo;t mean,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a sort of phenomenon now</p>
<p>where people are trying to control language,</p>
<p>I think too much.</p>
<p>Like you can&rsquo;t say anything</p>
<p>that someone else might find hurtful.</p>
<p>You have to refer to people in ways</p>
<p>they choose to be referred to,</p>
<p>even if those are ways that others don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>or ways they themselves have decided</p>
<p>or ways that might be psychologically</p>
<p>or clinically unhelpful.</p>
<p>So I think the over control of language is not good.</p>
<p>But I think the specificity of language</p>
<p>of what are we trying to say?</p>
<p>How are we defining it?</p>
<p>Even the word trauma, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about trauma.</p>
<p>So we want to define what that means, right?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t just mean like,</p>
<p>oh, anything kind of negative, right?</p>
<p>Because then that dilutes it down to meaning nothing, right?</p>
<p>It also doesn&rsquo;t just mean, you know,</p>
<p>injury in combat, right?</p>
<p>Like we have to talk about what that is.</p>
<p>So I think anchoring it to something</p>
<p>that rises to the magnitude of overwhelming</p>
<p>our coping skills and changing us,</p>
<p>like then at least I define it that way</p>
<p>and I can communicate that to you</p>
<p>and we can understand what we&rsquo;re talking about, right?</p>
<p>I think that another aspect of language,</p>
<p>while again, we need this middle ground</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think that it is okay</p>
<p>for the over control of language to shut down expression,</p>
<p>but we also have to acknowledge, you know,</p>
<p>how we&rsquo;re so much less distance from each other</p>
<p>through social media.</p>
<p>And I think social media can do very, very good things</p>
<p>as hopefully we&rsquo;re doing now, right?</p>
<p>But it can also be used to harm people from a distance,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>And how much hatefulness is there out there</p>
<p>that I think comes from anger and frustration in people,</p>
<p>again, back to trauma, right?</p>
<p>Where people just want to be angry</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not really issues that they&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s a target of that anger</p>
<p>and, you know, people feel beleaguered by that.</p>
<p>And the words that people use sometimes are so awful</p>
<p>that someone reading that,</p>
<p>like if you&rsquo;re in the demographic that&rsquo;s being targeted,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re reading that, I mean,</p>
<p>how does a person not feel beset upon, vulnerable, right?</p>
<p>And then I think that also fuels, you know,</p>
<p>things like we just had this terrible shooting in Buffalo,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Like just hate motivated, right?</p>
<p>And I think that because that kind of language</p>
<p>becomes very real to people who may take it in,</p>
<p>it fuels their hate and then they do something to enact it,</p>
<p>which of course creates greater fear and vulnerability.</p>
<p>And I think there was some civility and decorum</p>
<p>that was in our world not that long ago, right?</p>
<p>I mean, you know, I&rsquo;m in my early fifties,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not that old, right?</p>
<p>But I remember a time when in political discourse,</p>
<p>people were civil to one another, right?</p>
<p>Now so much, I mean, it&rsquo;s not all of it, right?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s an acceptance of things</p>
<p>that are just bombastic, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a circus sideshow sometimes</p>
<p>of people being just angry and aggressive.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not really linked to anything,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s allegedly linked to something,</p>
<p>but then other people&rsquo;s anger can attach to it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not about what it&rsquo;s about,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s about aligning with the anger.</p>
<p>And I think that there is so much damage</p>
<p>that comes from that.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, should we have,</p>
<p>should it be okay that people sometimes are talking,</p>
<p>communicating, using language in ways</p>
<p>that would like get us suspended from middle school, right?</p>
<p>Ways I don&rsquo;t want my eight-year-old to see.</p>
<p>I mean, is that really okay?</p>
<p>Or do we need to take a stand</p>
<p>for rational use of language?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want my use of language to be over-controlled</p>
<p>by someone who thinks they sort of understand better</p>
<p>than the rest of us, how to communicate with those.</p>
<p>Okay, I don&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s stereotypically a sort of idea of the left, say,</p>
<p>right, at least in our society.</p>
<p>But I also don&rsquo;t want language,</p>
<p>it can be so angry and so aggressive</p>
<p>that it is perpetuating or spreading vulnerability</p>
<p>and that it facilitates trauma.</p>
<p>And I think we could set standards as a society</p>
<p>where we say, look, I don&rsquo;t want anybody in power</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s going to behave that way, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if their whole agenda is like,</p>
<p>make Paul Conti&rsquo;s life better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still not going to vote for you, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re behaving towards others in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s denigrating, you&rsquo;re behaving in a way</p>
<p>that I feel essentially ashamed of, right?</p>
<p>And I feel that a lot, right?</p>
<p>I see the politics, you know, I see things play out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always political, of course, not always political,</p>
<p>but I see things play out and I think, oh my gosh,</p>
<p>I feel embarrassed.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re somehow okay with this.</p>
<p>Well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter which side</p>
<p>of the political spectrum it&rsquo;s coming to.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s an indicator that what we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>is really hurtful to us.</p>
<p>People become more angry.</p>
<p>They attach to the anger.</p>
<p>People feel more beleaguered.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more divisions between us.</p>
<p>And it seems more and more like, well,</p>
<p>we can only really identify with people who are just like us</p>
<p>and like, what does that really mean?</p>
<p>I mean, the divisions that it creates between us</p>
<p>and that, you know, that promotes</p>
<p>so many negative things, right?</p>
<p>I mean, think about ways in which it promotes</p>
<p>white supremacy, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just one example, right?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve seen that play out,</p>
<p>that this is really bad for us.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve got to look at that.</p>
<p>I mean, if we don&rsquo;t look at that,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think as though something is going to happen,</p>
<p>like something is happening, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s happening now.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it really, to my mind,</p>
<p>it really seeps down into the soil</p>
<p>of everything that we&rsquo;re talking about on all sides.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>People are activated.</p>
<p>People are upset about one thing or the other, right?</p>
<p>No one is immune from upset,</p>
<p>regardless of political affiliation.</p>
<p>And everybody seems to be upset nowadays.</p>
<p>And as I was hearing you talk about this,</p>
<p>I feel a lot of resonance with what you said.</p>
<p>And I also am hoping you run for office.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I have the gumption for that,</p>
<p>but thank you for that.</p>
<p>That would be wonderful.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to talk about a concept of taking care of oneself.</p>
<p>This comes up in the book.</p>
<p>This is something we talk a lot about on this podcast.</p>
<p>I mean, I think people have heard me blab endlessly</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll probably go into the grave</p>
<p>telling people to get sunlight in their eyes when they can</p>
<p>and to try and get proper sleep</p>
<p>and to have a few tools for reducing their anxiety</p>
<p>in real time and on and on and on.</p>
<p>You know, we hear about this concept</p>
<p>of taking care of oneself.</p>
<p>And I think at a surface level,</p>
<p>it can sound a little bit light.</p>
<p>You know, oh, take care, take good care.</p>
<p>But to me, it&rsquo;s a deep and powerful concept.</p>
<p>And I was very happy to see it in your book</p>
<p>and also to learn a lot of ideas</p>
<p>about what that really looks like.</p>
<p>Because whether or not somebody is in the early stages</p>
<p>of considering whether or not they have trauma</p>
<p>or is in the deep stages of working that through</p>
<p>or has made it through the tunnel some distance,</p>
<p>taking care of oneself is an ongoing process.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love for you to just describe</p>
<p>what taking care of oneself means to you as a clinician.</p>
<p>And of course, the practices and things</p>
<p>that you encourage people to do,</p>
<p>but how should we think about taking care of oneself?</p>
<p>Because on one extreme,</p>
<p>you could imagine massages, retreats, vacations,</p>
<p>and chefs for hire that take care</p>
<p>of everything for ourselves.</p>
<p>And on the other extreme, you could say,</p>
<p>leaning into life in a way</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re paying attention to small things</p>
<p>while working very, very hard.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s such a big concept,</p>
<p>but how do you think about taking care of oneself?</p>
<p>How should I take care of myself?</p>
<p>How should people take care of themselves?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I see here what I think is a very fascinating dichotomy,</p>
<p>that in some ways,</p>
<p>think about how complex our brains are,</p>
<p>how complex our psyches, our unconscious minds are.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much complexity there.</p>
<p>But on the other hand,</p>
<p>psychological concepts that are consistent with health</p>
<p>are often very simple,</p>
<p>by which I don&rsquo;t mean light,</p>
<p>but simple, straightforward.</p>
<p>And I think self-care is absolutely one of them.</p>
<p>I mean, how much is talked about</p>
<p>how to take care of oneself</p>
<p>that just skips over the basics</p>
<p>that are necessary as a building block for all else?</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t matter how many chefs or vacations</p>
<p>or whatever a person has,</p>
<p>if the basics of self-care aren&rsquo;t squared away.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not a light concept to say,</p>
<p>like, look, are you sleeping enough?</p>
<p>Are you eating well?</p>
<p>Are you getting natural light?</p>
<p>Are you interacting with people</p>
<p>who are good to interact with?</p>
<p>Are you accepting negative interactions in your life?</p>
<p>Are you living in circumstances</p>
<p>that make you feel okay or not?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very, very basic premises,</p>
<p>but so often we&rsquo;re not looking at them at all.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not looking at them at all</p>
<p>because we tend to skip over them.</p>
<p>And we tend to skip over them either</p>
<p>because again, in some automatic way</p>
<p>that sometimes is trauma-driven</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re not gonna look at that.</p>
<p>And often not taking care of ourselves</p>
<p>can have the punishment, distraction.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much that can come into that.</p>
<p>Or our sense of power is tied</p>
<p>to not taking care of ourselves.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ll give you an example is</p>
<p>I tend to, for whatever reason,</p>
<p>do reasonably well with very poor self-care, right?</p>
<p>And like, that was very adaptive</p>
<p>when I was into medical training, right?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, okay, I can eat a lot today.</p>
<p>I can not eat, right?</p>
<p>I can sleep two hours.</p>
<p>I can sleep eight, right?</p>
<p>I mean, overall, that&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>And it hasn&rsquo;t been good for me as I&rsquo;ve aged,</p>
<p>but then I realized somebody,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing all these things to make myself healthier,</p>
<p>but like, what, I ignore that, right?</p>
<p>And why am I ignoring it?</p>
<p>That was a key question.</p>
<p>Why am I ignoring it?</p>
<p>Because somewhere inside of me as it was,</p>
<p>and still to some extent is,</p>
<p>this idea that my ability to be really functional, right?</p>
<p>To generate success in the world around me</p>
<p>is tied to my ability to do that, right?</p>
<p>That, oh, but if I stop doing that</p>
<p>and now I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m eating and sleeping regularly,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m gonna lose some edge.</p>
<p>And so, and even I think about this all the time,</p>
<p>but I realized, hey, I&rsquo;m also,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doing it inside, you know?</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s really grounding to the basics</p>
<p>that really help us of like,</p>
<p>what are the basics of what I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>and not doing in my life?</p>
<p>Diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances,</p>
<p>leisure activities, I mean, sunlight.</p>
<p>I mean, I think immensely important</p>
<p>and dramatically undervalued.</p>
<p>I wanna thank you for that.</p>
<p>And I wanna thank you for today&rsquo;s discussion.</p>
<p>I found it to be incredibly informative</p>
<p>and I know our listeners will also.</p>
<p>I also wanna thank you for the work you do.</p>
<p>I mean, you obviously run an incredibly</p>
<p>robust clinical practice that I&rsquo;m aware</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re constantly trying to improve,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s operating at the highest levels already.</p>
<p>And I really, the reason why you&rsquo;re here today</p>
<p>is because I&rsquo;ve done a wide and deep search</p>
<p>for people in these areas.</p>
<p>And there are so few who have the background</p>
<p>in medical training and physiology</p>
<p>in the psychoanalytic and psychiatric realm</p>
<p>and also have a grounding toward the future,</p>
<p>you know, of what&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>and who can encapsulate so many different orientations</p>
<p>and bring them together into a coherent piece.</p>
<p>So I really thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah, and for your book, which is incredible.</p>
<p>I will go on record saying,</p>
<p>I think this is the definitive book on trauma.</p>
<p>And I really encourage people to read it</p>
<p>and will continue to encourage people to read it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so many valuable takeaways and insights and tools there.</p>
<p>So on behalf of the listeners and myself,</p>
<p>thank you so much for joining us today.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very welcome.</p>
<p>And I take that to heart</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m very appreciative of being here.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re very welcome and thank you as well.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining me for my discussion</p>
<p>with Dr. Paul Conte.</p>
<p>I also highly recommend that you explore his new book,</p>
<p>which is trauma, the invisible epidemic,</p>
<p>how trauma works and how we can heal from it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an exceptional resource,</p>
<p>both for those that have trauma</p>
<p>and those that don&rsquo;t have trauma</p>
<p>or those that suspect they might have trauma.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s a deep dive into what trauma is</p>
<p>and offers many simple tools that anyone can apply</p>
<p>with a therapist or not in order to heal from trauma.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;d like to learn more about Dr. Conte</p>
<p>and the work he does directly with patients,</p>
<p>please check out his website, pacificpremiergroup.com.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also provided a link to both the book</p>
<p>and pacificpremiergroup.com in the show note captions.</p>

<p>On YouTube, you can leave us comments or suggestions</p>
<p>about content that you&rsquo;d like us to cover</p>
<p>as well as suggestions of future guests</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;d like us to host on the podcast.</p>
<p>We do read all those comments.</p>
<p>Please also check out the sponsors mentioned</p>
<p>at the beginning of today&rsquo;s episode.</p>
<p>That is the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>Not so much in today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>but in many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>we discuss supplements.</p>
<p>While supplements aren&rsquo;t necessary for everybody,</p>
<p>many people derive tremendous benefit from them</p>
<p>for things like improving the transition time</p>
<p>and the depth of sleep each night,</p>
<p>for improving focus, for managing anxiety,</p>
<p>and for many other aspects of mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>For that reason, the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>has partnered with Momentus Supplements</p>
<p>because first off, they are of the very highest quality.</p>
<p>They also ship internationally,</p>
<p>which many other supplement companies do not.</p>
<p>And we wanted to have a one-stop location</p>
<p>where people could find and access the supplements</p>
<p>that are discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>So if you go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>you will find many of the supplements</p>
<p>that are commonly discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>I should just mention that the catalog of supplements there</p>
<p>will be expanding in the weeks and months to follow,</p>
<p>but already a number of them for sleep and focus</p>
<p>and other aspects of mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance</p>
<p>are already there at livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not already following Huberman Lab</p>
<p>on Instagram and Twitter, please do so.</p>
<p>There, I cover science and science-based tools,</p>
<p>some of which overlaps with the content</p>
<p>to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>but much of which is distinct from the information</p>
<p>covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>We also have a newsletter</p>
<p>called the Neural Network Newsletter,</p>
<p>where we offer distilled information,</p>
<p>so lists of protocols and key takeaways</p>
<p>from podcast episodes.</p>
<p>If you want to sign up for the newsletter,</p>
<p>all it requires is your email.</p>
<p>Please know that we do not share your email with anybody.</p>
<p>We have a very clear privacy policy.</p>
<p>You can find all that by going to HubermanLab.com.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a menu there where you can sign up</p>
<p>for the Neural Network Newsletter.</p>
<p>You can also immediately get access</p>
<p>to some example newsletters,</p>
<p>so you know what the newsletter is all about.</p>
<p>So thank you once again for joining me</p>
<p>for my discussion with Dr. Paul Conte,</p>
<p>and last but certainly not least,</p>
<p>thank you for your interest in science.</p>
