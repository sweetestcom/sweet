<p>lot of weight problems early on or</p>
<p>knowledge did you just start gaining</p>
<p>weight at a certain point what what</p>
<p>happened</p>
<p>so for most of my life I was pretty</p>
<p>athletic and played a lot of sports and</p>
<p>activities and I was probably but I was</p>
<p>always maybe at least 10 or 15 pounds</p>
<p>overweight I didn&rsquo;t really know that at</p>
<p>the time so like right now my weight is</p>
<p>about 155 pounds I&rsquo;m five foot six and a</p>
<p>half I put seven so but you know during</p>
<p>you my college soccer playing career I</p>
<p>was 170 pounds but to say so I never</p>
<p>really was much lower than that but what</p>
<p>happened is after college and I stopped</p>
<p>playing soccer as much and I wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really exercising as much so I would end</p>
<p>up being like 20 pounds higher than that</p>
<p>so I 190 pounds I would fluctuate</p>
<p>actually from my let&rsquo;s say 20s until on</p>
<p>my 37 now so in between that area I</p>
<p>would fluctuate 20 pounds every year and</p>
<p>I would gain 20 pounds and lose 20</p>
<p>pounds in gained 20 pounds in lose 20</p>
<p>pounds until this year when I decided to</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to do that anymore I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to try to keep it off and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to figure out how to do that Wow</p>
<p>so when you were in college playing</p>
<p>soccer what type of diet did you have</p>
<p>back then so I didn&rsquo;t have I would say</p>
<p>no guys okay ate whatever I wanted to</p>
<p>eat I didn&rsquo;t really think about it at</p>
<p>all</p>
<p>even growing up I didn&rsquo;t think about</p>
<p>that much I didn&rsquo;t think anything about</p>
<p>different types of calories or anything</p>
<p>like that it was just I ate what I</p>
<p>wanted to eat and that was really it Wow</p>
<p>amazing so what made you want to decide</p>
<p>to say you know what that&rsquo;s it I got to</p>
<p>lose this weight what what was it well I</p>
<p>guess this time I just said to my wife</p>
<p>would always say this isn&rsquo;t healthy for</p>
<p>you you know it&rsquo;s not healthy for you to</p>
<p>gain weight and lose weight and gain</p>
<p>weight and lose weight and my argument</p>
<p>at the time was well it&rsquo;s better to lose</p>
<p>it and just keep it on I guess but she</p>
<p>point was I just needed to figure out</p>
<p>something where I could keep it all and</p>
<p>figure out a lifestyle change that was</p>
<p>the whole big thing instead of just</p>
<p>dieting for a certain amount of time</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say a few months and then going</p>
<p>off of that which is what I would have</p>
<p>what would happen is January would come</p>
<p>around after the holidays I would feel</p>
<p>disgusting and I would see myself in the</p>
<p>mirror I was 20 pounds to have year</p>
<p>whatever and I do play an adult soccer</p>
<p>league and it was like the season would</p>
<p>start to come up and I want to kind of</p>
<p>be able to run a little bit let&rsquo;s say so</p>
<p>I would watch what I was eating but I</p>
<p>would just watch my calories they never</p>
<p>really know what I was doing I just know</p>
<p>I knew at the time lower my calories and</p>
<p>I had success doing that so I would do</p>
<p>that and then I would lose it but then</p>
<p>it will come back so this time I said to</p>
<p>myself I&rsquo;m going to figure out how the</p>
<p>body works I want to like research and</p>
<p>not just know it&rsquo;s calories so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when I kind of stumbled upon your site</p>
<p>and your YouTube channel and you started</p>
<p>soaking up as much knowledge as I could</p>
<p>about how the body works and what&rsquo;s best</p>
<p>for me and that kind of stuff awesome</p>
<p>so then so you started doing did you a</p>
<p>combination of just ketosis or you do a</p>
<p>10-minute fasting at the same time what</p>
<p>did you do so the plan was I started in</p>
<p>January I was I said 190 pounds this</p>
<p>year and I just started watching my</p>
<p>calories like I usually did and for the</p>
<p>first month</p>
<p>I did the research while I was watching</p>
<p>my calories and I ended up losing around</p>
<p>like 15 pounds or so just doing that and</p>
<p>then I started figuring out more</p>
<p>information from you and I started to</p>
<p>then I got to about 20 pounds and I said</p>
<p>okay now I&rsquo;m at my 170 pound weight that</p>
<p>I usually get to I want to see how far I</p>
<p>can go here I really want to lose as</p>
<p>much body fat as I can and get in the</p>
<p>best shape of my life so I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>have to use these tips and these tricks</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s information that I&rsquo;m learning</p>
<p>so then that&rsquo;s what I did I started to</p>
<p>do the first thing I did was watch the</p>
<p>type of calories that I was eating so I</p>
<p>learned about healthy fats and I learned</p>
<p>about carbohydrates are horrible and I</p>
<p>started to lowering the carbohydrates</p>
<p>and increase the fats and try to have</p>
<p>enough protein and that kind of stuff</p>
<p>that was like my phase - I&rsquo;ll say and</p>
<p>then phase 3 was in a minute fasting I</p>
<p>got informational and a minute fast</p>
<p>and I was probably at that time about 23</p>
<p>or so pounds down to where I wanted to</p>
<p>be so I said let me do this in a minute</p>
<p>fast and even though this is working for</p>
<p>me with watching my calories and having</p>
<p>healthy calories by me doing a minute</p>
<p>fasting and try it and that&rsquo;s when I was</p>
<p>able to lose like the last 10 pounds</p>
<p>which is always the hardest for me I</p>
<p>really tried to push it I really</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t do it until I did a minute</p>
<p>fasting which was my stage 3 I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to call that and now I&rsquo;m kind of like in</p>
<p>almost a stage 4 or 5 all the way back</p>
<p>out stage 4 for me is like exercise with</p>
<p>in a minute fasting I was always doing</p>
<p>some type of exercise during this time I</p>
<p>would like work out with weights three</p>
<p>times a week but nothing crazy just like</p>
<p>an hour in the gym and then I would also</p>
<p>do running but the biggest thing for me</p>
<p>was I did running during my fasting</p>
<p>window in the morning so I know some</p>
<p>people have a problem with that and at</p>
<p>first I thought I couldn&rsquo;t do that I was</p>
<p>always under the impression since my</p>
<p>soccer days I need to have carbohydrates</p>
<p>for the soccer game tomorrow and I got</p>
<p>to make sure I&rsquo;m all ready to go for</p>
<p>this and had this energy and I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand the body and so my first</p>
<p>couple of runs I was shocked so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see that I performed better than I did</p>
<p>when I was eating breakfast and then</p>
<p>running let&rsquo;s just say this is that a</p>
<p>piece of false data like people think</p>
<p>they have to have Gatorade or glucose</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re going to crash or</p>
<p>whatever it is not sure that the biggest</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the biggest thing and especially</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m trying to take this information</p>
<p>with my own children I have three kids</p>
<p>seven eight and nine and their diets are</p>
<p>I would say not as good as they could be</p>
<p>and so like you know they play sports</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like we don&rsquo;t need that Gatorade</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s not going to help you it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just a free let&rsquo;s just have some water</p>
<p>especially kids will chug the whole</p>
<p>thing again right before the game even</p>
<p>starts and it&rsquo;s just not good it&rsquo;s bad</p>
<p>so you so here you did that and then you</p>
<p>the intimate of fasting what pattern are</p>
<p>you using now so what I did in the</p>
<p>beginning is I&rsquo;m kind of doing the same</p>
<p>I did 12 and I did 16 and 8 so I would</p>
<p>do 16 hours faster than my window would</p>
<p>be like 12 to 8 eating window eating</p>
<p>window let&rsquo;s just say and</p>
<p>sometimes I mean it&rsquo;s not a waste 12-day</p>
<p>bill can be I liked it you can flex flex</p>
<p>it wherever you need that&rsquo;s what I love</p>
<p>that so if I need to eat lunch or left</p>
<p>on the thirty then I would stop eating</p>
<p>earlier or something a lot of times I</p>
<p>would try to stop eating at 6 o&rsquo;clock at</p>
<p>night if I could I figured let me push</p>
<p>my fasting window as long as I could if</p>
<p>I could do it if it fit in to the</p>
<p>schedule and so that&rsquo;s what I would do a</p>
<p>lot of times I would only do 11:30 at</p>
<p>least sorry 11:30 and I would stop</p>
<p>eating at 6:00 what to say so really it</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t 68 then I guess 80 and 6 you know</p>
<p>mm-hmm you go to dinner a lot or do you</p>
<p>pretty much eat at home well there is</p>
<p>one of the thing I really didn&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about that I do which I kind of feel a</p>
<p>little bad that I do but I do have</p>
<p>during this time I have cheat days and</p>
<p>especially in the beginning and in fact</p>
<p>the beginning of my weight loss journey</p>
<p>was really all mental I know I was doing</p>
<p>calories but now that I&rsquo;m in a different</p>
<p>state now that a lot of times I feel</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m in ketosis and I feel like</p>
<p>especially now I&rsquo;m not I really have</p>
<p>cravings for sugar but in the beginning</p>
<p>when I was just doing calories I would</p>
<p>still want chocolate chip cookies and I</p>
<p>would still want brownies and still want</p>
<p>the Rideau is not kind of stuff and so</p>
<p>what I would do was I would have six</p>
<p>healthy eating days and on the seventh</p>
<p>day I would end up having two livid</p>
<p>treats or sweets or whatever it was or</p>
<p>if we went out to dinner I try to make</p>
<p>that day fall on that day oh my cheat</p>
<p>day I would call it a river it was or if</p>
<p>we were out socially and we were having</p>
<p>a couple drinks of alcohol or something</p>
<p>like that so that&rsquo;s kind of how I would</p>
<p>do it in the beginning now I don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>really feel like I need to do that it</p>
<p>just happens when we have parties in the</p>
<p>summer or barbecues and you know then I</p>
<p>feel like I can have a little bit more</p>
<p>on those days yeah interesting and so</p>
<p>like your first meal what time is that</p>
<p>like 11 or 12 or yeah right now I</p>
<p>usually eat around 11 o&rsquo;clock or 11:30</p>
<p>and I usually have spinach I have a big</p>
<p>fish salad like in the beginning when</p>
<p>you start talking to videos and I was</p>
<p>and you were talking about how much you</p>
<p>ate in terms of the greens and I was</p>
<p>like oh my god that money that&rsquo;s a lot I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if I can eat all that and now</p>
<p>I eat 7 cups of spinach salad for lunch</p>
<p>with chicken</p>
<p>I go to Surrey chicken I&rsquo;ll do like 3/4</p>
<p>of a breast of chicken and I&rsquo;ll do or</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do like tuna in there or some type</p>
<p>of protein with cheese and that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>what I have and if I need to have an</p>
<p>apple I will but when I&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>watching it my carbs I won&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>Apple</p>
<p>it depends upon trying to I get at this</p>
<p>point I&rsquo;m trying to stick between 50 and</p>
<p>100 carbs and when I&rsquo;m really watching</p>
<p>it because I came back from vacation and</p>
<p>I was like you know I didn&rsquo;t do great on</p>
<p>vacation so I was like sticking to 50</p>
<p>cars for these last let&rsquo;s say 10 or 11</p>
<p>days and I came back I won&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>piece of fruit for lunch</p>
<p>so then okay so then you do your first</p>
<p>meal and then the second meal do you eat</p>
<p>a similar thing then I depend</p>
<p>I usually I&rsquo;ll have eggs eggs were like</p>
<p>a huge staple for me during this whole</p>
<p>thing even when I was just watching</p>
<p>calories and I&rsquo;ll have a full egg</p>
<p>omelette is my favorite thing to have</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so quick and easy to make a four</p>
<p>egg omelette with cheese I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>put salsa on there or some hot sauce or</p>
<p>something and that&rsquo;s really what I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>eat for dinner</p>
<p>I do have if I feel like I need it I</p>
<p>tried the snack in between because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to have my insulin get raised at</p>
<p>all if possible I will have pistachios</p>
<p>or some type of nut that I that I have</p>
<p>available at the time so that&rsquo;s Mike</p>
<p>like snack kind of thing anon right so</p>
<p>you basically have a six pack AB right</p>
<p>now right oh yeah absolutely I never I</p>
<p>never really had six pack ads let&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>say even when I 170 pounds soccer weight</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really it wasn&rsquo;t defined let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just say in terms of that you can kind</p>
<p>of see the outside but you never could</p>
<p>see the inside now you can definitely</p>
<p>see the whole thing especially if I like</p>
<p>flex a little bit that&rsquo;s very prominent</p>
<p>and you know that definitely feels good</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m proud that I&rsquo;ll have to worry about</p>
<p>wearing a swim shirt when I go with my</p>
<p>kids to the pool or something which I</p>
<p>would when I was 180 pounds or hung 90</p>
<p>pounds if I were embarrassed in that way</p>
<p>but besides just looking better</p>
<p>I just feel a hundred percent better</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s hard to tell how you feel</p>
<p>really when you&rsquo;re 180 pounds you know</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t feel good but if I could</p>
<p>compare somehow get the feeling trapped</p>
<p>in a bottle for both feelings at the</p>
<p>same time it&rsquo;s so much better now than</p>
<p>it ranked yeah oh yeah and then as</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re here why</p>
<p>now okay with that now she&rsquo;s not telling</p>
<p>you to lose any more weight or she good</p>
<p>with that she&rsquo;s good she&rsquo;s good with it</p>
<p>she has always always been pretty</p>
<p>fitting herself and I like she runs and</p>
<p>she watches what she eats she eating but</p>
<p>the only thing with this is she&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>concerned because I am obsessed with</p>
<p>things sometimes feel like when I latch</p>
<p>on to something right I&rsquo;m going to do it</p>
<p>do it do it do it do it so she is just</p>
<p>skeptical that am I going to relapse am</p>
<p>I going to you know not stick with this</p>
<p>but the biggest challenge for me was I</p>
<p>was on vacation in Disneyworld with my</p>
<p>family two weeks ago and I was having</p>
<p>tons of cheat days and I said when I get</p>
<p>back I am NOT going to do what I used to</p>
<p>do on vacation which is just say I</p>
<p>forget it for the summer I&rsquo;m going right</p>
<p>back to it</p>
<p>and I did and for the last I gained this</p>
<p>is actually a little embarrassing but it</p>
<p>was kind of an experiment for me I</p>
<p>wanted to see what would happen you know</p>
<p>what would my body do and so on vacation</p>
<p>I had 12 vacation days which is a pretty</p>
<p>significant vacation and I ate horribly</p>
<p>and I gained about 14 pounds and I said</p>
<p>I want to see what happens how long it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to take any losses wait so now</p>
<p>since I&rsquo;ve been back I lost 12 of those</p>
<p>14 pounds by doing teeth I being in</p>
<p>ketosis and watching everything I was</p>
<p>eating very strict and I have about two</p>
<p>pounds to go and it&rsquo;s been 10 days since</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been back Wow I think that&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>point because you the whole goal is to</p>
<p>get your body in a state where you have</p>
<p>enough health reserve that you can go</p>
<p>off the program you know what&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>happen you know how to get back you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not in a danger State where I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what to do it&rsquo;s not working and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s you know like it&rsquo;s not about just</p>
<p>like always have to avoid this little</p>
<p>thing and that too but the point is like</p>
<p>you know what to do now you&rsquo;re not in a</p>
<p>mystery about it and then also what</p>
<p>about your performance now playing</p>
<p>soccer like how is you feel like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>faster or you more performance with</p>
<p>anything with that</p>
<p>yeah well I&rsquo;m definitely when I wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>watching what I was eating I was</p>
<p>definitely more sluggish I was</p>
<p>definitely faster obviously because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not care</p>
<p>thirty pounds last 35 pounds less than I</p>
<p>was before so which I can hard to fathom</p>
<p>that to that I was 30 pounds heavier I</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t imagine carrying 30 pounds now</p>
<p>and trying to run around soccer field</p>
<p>but I did you know it&rsquo;s amazing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>amazing to me actually that a lot of</p>
<p>people are overweight is they need more</p>
<p>weight need to be and they are still</p>
<p>able to do so many things your body is</p>
<p>so strong but it will be so much</p>
<p>stronger if they lost that weight you</p>
<p>know so there&rsquo;s definitely a big</p>
<p>performance difference yes and I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just amazing the professional</p>
<p>athletes that are especially like even</p>
<p>in I did college wrestling the stuff</p>
<p>that we would eat is crazy I mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just like insane so I mean I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what you soccer players eat but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably just the same as everyone else</p>
<p>right yeah well especially in college no</p>
<p>one was paying attention nutrition you</p>
<p>know back in 2000 and whatever it was it</p>
<p>you know or 19 actually a lot older than</p>
<p>that so no one was paying attention to</p>
<p>those things we were just we just we</p>
<p>actually thought have a big pasta dinner</p>
<p>we would have a whole group together the</p>
<p>team would get together and like before</p>
<p>we have a big pasta dinner with garlic</p>
<p>bread and pasta more loading up on our</p>
<p>car says tomorrow that&rsquo;s going to help</p>
<p>us perform obviously we didn&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>we were doing yeah and I think that</p>
<p>there are tons of people that don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re doing and they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>going with old information that wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not true and this is the biggest</p>
<p>thing now so I&rsquo;m trying to tell people</p>
<p>that our family and friends without</p>
<p>protruding into their life I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>trying to tell them what to do but I</p>
<p>like to also give them advice so like on</p>
<p>Facebook I have a little channel a</p>
<p>friend but I will tell them information</p>
<p>that I learned basically from you I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>kind of turnkey in this information to</p>
<p>them and just saying what works for me</p>
<p>and you should think about this it can</p>
<p>help you because a lot of people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand about fat doesn&rsquo;t make you</p>
<p>fat and carbohydrates are horrible they</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t understand that at all</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s the challenge it&rsquo;s like they</p>
<p>have to kind of reach for some help that</p>
<p>you you just basically invalidate</p>
<p>everything that they think is right and</p>
<p>so I always like really I don&rsquo;t I never</p>
<p>tell people what to do I always tell</p>
<p>them why I need to do it the explanation</p>
<p>so they can</p>
<p>have some reality on that but yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a challenge to family and friends</p>
<p>I really appreciated your channel by the</p>
<p>way just wanted to say thank you again</p>
<p>because I am kind of that kind of person</p>
<p>I want to know why am I doing this</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the reason how does it work</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just how my brain works</p>
<p>especially when I&rsquo;m going to commit to</p>
<p>something and so I was able to learn</p>
<p>about insulin and learn about potassium</p>
<p>and how much I need and how am I going</p>
<p>to get it from this and that and I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to eat 25 bananas it&rsquo;s not going</p>
<p>to work and you know and all those kind</p>
<p>of things</p>
<p>and I just learned the most from from</p>
<p>your channel and I&rsquo;m constantly learning</p>
<p>more and more and just trying to turn</p>
<p>key like I said that information to</p>
<p>people just to let them know because I</p>
<p>just feel like I say a lot people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know and I get sad now now that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>paying attention I feel like I&rsquo;ve been a</p>
<p>walk-in here you know I&rsquo;m paying</p>
<p>attention and just driving my car I see</p>
<p>people and I&rsquo;m thinking to myself I just</p>
<p>wish that you could know this</p>
<p>information it would help you so much</p>
<p>without pulling over to the side of the</p>
<p>road and waving them down or anything I</p>
<p>am the same thing I was on a trip</p>
<p>recently and I&rsquo;m like I have to withhold</p>
<p>myself because you just want to go</p>
<p>listen you could I could help them solve</p>
<p>it so fast but they have to really reach</p>
<p>for help in the airport so I&rsquo;m like oh</p>
<p>my gosh if I could just tell this person</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s a situation but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>awesome you did a really good job Dan</p>
<p>and I appreciate the interview it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing I mean that before and</p>
<p>after is incredible so yeah I would say</p>
<p>one of the last things I think</p>
<p>potentially we talked about was the</p>
<p>exercise that I did in the morning and</p>
<p>that was like to me it was like the most</p>
<p>important part because this is how I</p>
<p>felt in my mind I don&rsquo;t even know if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s exactly correct but the information</p>
<p>I got from you I felt that if I woke up</p>
<p>in the morning so I sucked it up and I</p>
<p>got up an hour early and I ran two and a</p>
<p>half miles I didn&rsquo;t go crazy just two</p>
<p>and a half miles it took it takes like</p>
<p>20 minutes and I felt like I was I was</p>
<p>had plenty of energy and when I did that</p>
<p>I felt better about myself I also felt</p>
<p>that I was in my mind I had stored like</p>
<p>glucose and glycogen in my muscles but I</p>
<p>wanted to get through in order to get to</p>
<p>the fact that&rsquo;s what I felt like it was</p>
<p>happening so I felt like if I went out</p>
<p>and did that run I would maybe jumpstart</p>
<p>that even more by getting through that</p>
<p>and using the energy to my muscles</p>
<p>during that time and</p>
<p>till I would be done doing my run let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just say seven o&rsquo;clock or 6:30 and then</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t eat again for you know four</p>
<p>hours or so till 11:30 and I really felt</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if is even true but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when my body was really burning the fat</p>
<p>from after I ran until I ate at 11:30 or</p>
<p>something like that well then that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that is the best thing to do I think</p>
<p>apparently you&rsquo;re able to do that so you</p>
<p>must not have your your insulin you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t probably have some aberration with</p>
<p>your insulin right now must be working</p>
<p>really good to be able to do that most</p>
<p>people they haven&rsquo;t repaired it to the</p>
<p>degree that they could do that just to</p>
<p>be able to switch over to fat-burning</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ll drop their glycogen get</p>
<p>dizzy and they start having all these</p>
<p>hypoglycemic effects so yeah that is the</p>
<p>best way to do it if you can do it so</p>
<p>that means that you&rsquo;re obviously above</p>
<p>average health-wise you don&rsquo;t have that</p>
<p>dysfunction of insulin so that&rsquo;s I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing a great job that&rsquo;s exactly</p>
<p>what you need to do tap out the glycogen</p>
<p>go right to the fat burning now I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to keep riding the wave like you</p>
<p>said just keep riding as long as I can</p>
<p>and keep burning as much as I can and</p>
<p>see how how much I can get to at this</p>
<p>point like I&rsquo;m just going to show my</p>
<p>wife and everyone else that I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>this is missing my lifestyle this isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just I did this for four or five months</p>
<p>wherever it was you know which it did</p>
<p>only take me it took me 20 weeks to get</p>
<p>down to the initial weight that I was in</p>
<p>the before-and-after picture which was</p>
<p>156 pounds I ended up being 154 pounds</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s kind of where I want to be</p>
<p>hundred fifty-four pounds and so now I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just figuring out ways to maintain and</p>
<p>be able to live life socially without</p>
<p>having to say I like that I feel like</p>
<p>now I don&rsquo;t have to turn down something</p>
<p>if somebody offers it to me even though</p>
<p>I could if I want to but I could just</p>
<p>have it and that&rsquo;s not going to kill me</p>
<p>as those posed before I would have it</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;d have like five more or</p>
<p>something and I have I&rsquo;d say well I had</p>
<p>a bad day today I&rsquo;m going to have a bad</p>
<p>day tomorrow it doesn&rsquo;t matter and I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t go back onto it but now I feel</p>
<p>like even if I have a tough cheat day</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say on the weekend we go to a</p>
<p>party I know that I can go right back on</p>
<p>it the next day and I remember what I</p>
<p>feel like and I remember what I feel</p>
<p>like on a Saturday night after I have</p>
<p>all that disgusting stuff because I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t feel good I actually feel sluggish</p>
<p>and when I was in Disneyworld we after</p>
<p>we ate breakfast I like a 20-minute I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>you down like this like tired you know</p>
<p>on the monorail barely making it over to</p>
<p>the Magic Kingdom I would just like</p>
<p>dying there thinking up this horrible</p>
<p>what am i doing I think that was a good</p>
<p>demonstration to be able to just go off</p>
<p>just so you really know for sure yeah</p>
<p>okay so this isn&rsquo;t going to work long</p>
<p>term right yeah exactly yeah and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re sounds like your awareness is just</p>
<p>very high right now it&rsquo;s like you know</p>
<p>exactly what&rsquo;s going on so you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>like clueless about you know most people</p>
<p>with what&rsquo;s going on I don&rsquo;t have to use</p>
<p>the app like I used to used a calorie</p>
<p>tracker some type of an app and at this</p>
<p>point obviously now that done so much I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really feel like I need to do that</p>
<p>you like you should have intuitions</p>
<p>there I know that I can have this I can</p>
<p>know I can have that and where it will</p>
<p>make me feel and how it will make me</p>
<p>feel afterwards yeah you&rsquo;re right I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>there now anything awesome well thank</p>
<p>you so much Stan I appreciate the</p>
<p>interview sure I appreciate your time</p>
<p>and thanks for putting those videos out</p>
<p>there and please keep putting as much as</p>
<p>you can as many videos as you possibly</p>
<p>can out there will be great can I ask</p>
<p>you a question give like a minute for</p>
<p>that I have a question about I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>sure if you know the answer or not but I</p>
<p>have a question about cancer actually</p>
<p>and I have read a few things about how</p>
<p>ketosis can help to not fuel cancer</p>
<p>cells and maybe cancer cells aren&rsquo;t off</p>
<p>of sugar they aren&rsquo;t up glucose maybe</p>
<p>certain kinds I&rsquo;m not really sure you</p>
<p>know anything about that</p>
<p>yeah well the two things number one</p>
<p>cancer is such a big business now that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to find a lot of</p>
<p>studies out there because no one&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to pay for the funding on it</p>
<p>and it would just turn the whole apple</p>
<p>cart upside down so but I do know that</p>
<p>when they do PET scans they basically</p>
<p>monitor what part of your body has the</p>
<p>fastest metabolism of glucose which is</p>
<p>basically the cancer loves sugar there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>certain treatments right now call like</p>
<p>insulin potentiation therapy where</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll inject you with insulin with a</p>
<p>little bit of chemo and so they they</p>
<p>raise the they drop your sugar and</p>
<p>apparently they cause the cancer to eat</p>
<p>up all this</p>
<p>the sugar which is filled with chemo or</p>
<p>whatever and then they die but the point</p>
<p>is that yeah you&rsquo;re going to be much</p>
<p>safer if you what you&rsquo;re doing now to</p>
<p>prevent cancer and cancer could also</p>
<p>come from many different things like a</p>
<p>lot of herbicides pesticides one of the</p>
<p>big things now that&rsquo;s going up not</p>
<p>non-hodgkins lymphoma is connected to</p>
<p>glyphosate which is another GMO food so</p>
<p>yeah you can do them in a fasting you</p>
<p>can do ketogenic but you got to make</p>
<p>sure the quality food is non-gmo organic</p>
<p>is all possible wild-caught grass-fed</p>
<p>that type of thing and then you&rsquo;re much</p>
<p>more bulletproof but so yeah I think</p>
<p>sugar has a huge impact on feeding it</p>
<p>and then if you if you&rsquo;d a lot of</p>
<p>cruciferous foods you also can starve</p>
<p>off tumors and benign tumors and even</p>
<p>cancer as well so they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>anti-cancer they have answer key</p>
<p>anti-cancer properties I do I know I</p>
<p>have you just for one more minute for a</p>
<p>personal question can I get you all</p>
<p>right lymph nodes being inflamed or</p>
<p>something or you know I have a few that</p>
<p>are a little bit I think I&rsquo;m curious if</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve always been that way and now</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve lost weight I can feel them</p>
<p>and they just have bigger you know what</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s like in like a groin area</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just curious if no they can always</p>
<p>be like that yeah you you you have a lot</p>
<p>of lymph nodes in your neck in the groin</p>
<p>in different areas that basically are</p>
<p>and when you lose weight you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>feel them more and they&rsquo;re like what the</p>
<p>heck is this I didn&rsquo;t feel this before</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s really people kind of like</p>
<p>they kind of freak out about it</p>
<p>sometimes I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about that</p>
<p>unless you find it&rsquo;s getting bigger and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really really tender</p>
<p>you have lymph nodes all over the place</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just sitting there they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>basically helping your immune system and</p>
<p>they probably might even swell up if you</p>
<p>eat more sugar but if they&rsquo;re staying</p>
<p>the same size I would not worry about</p>
<p>them at all they&rsquo;re not a problem</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re part of a natural filtering</p>
<p>process with with the white blood cell</p>
<p>and your immune</p>
<p>all right thank you I really appreciate</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>well thank you thank you for your time</p>
<p>and thank you for doing this I really</p>
<p>appreciate it I&rsquo;m going to keep putting</p>
<p>taking your information and giving it</p>
<p>out there to like my Facebook people all</p>
<p>my little healthier us page and Cal than</p>
<p>everything I can tell them and hopefully</p>
<p>people gravitate to it without getting</p>
<p>having to be pushed sometimes you got to</p>
<p>push a couple of my friends towards it</p>
<p>but yeah I think that&rsquo;s great spread the</p>
<p>word and let&rsquo;s help those people that</p>
<p>want help how about that sounds good</p>
<p>okay thanks Dan hi thanks so much sure</p>
