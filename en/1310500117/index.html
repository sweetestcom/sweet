    <p>The following is a conversation with Sheldon Solomon, a social psychologist, a philosopher,</p>
<p>co developer of terror management theory, and co author of The Warm at the Core on the role of</p>
<p>death in life. He further carried the ideas of Ernest Becker that can crudely summarize as the</p>
<p>idea that our fear of death is at the core of the human condition and the driver of most of the</p>
<p>creations of human civilization. Quick summary of the sponsors Blinkist, ExpressVPN, and Cash App.</p>

<p>big impact on my thinking about human cognition, consciousness, and the deep ocean currents of our</p>
<p>mind that are behind the surface behaviors we observe. Many people have told me that they think</p>
<p>about death, or don&rsquo;t think about death, fear death, or don&rsquo;t fear death, but I think not many</p>
<p>people think about this topic deeply, rigorously, in the way that Nietzsche suggested. This topic,</p>
<p>like many that lead to deep personal self reflection, frankly is dangerous for the mind.</p>
<p>As all first principles thinking about the human condition is, if you gaze long into the abyss,</p>
<p>like Nietzsche said, the abyss will gaze back into you. I have been recently reading a lot</p>
<p>about World War II, Stalin, and Hitler. It feels to me that there is some fundamental truth there</p>
<p>to be discovered, in the moments of history that changed everything, the suffering, the triumphs.</p>
<p>If I bring up Donald Trump or Vladimir Putin in these conversations, it is never through</p>
<p>a political lens. I&rsquo;m not left nor right. I think for myself, deeply, and often question everything,</p>
<p>changing my mind as often as is needed. I ask for your patience, empathy, and rigorous thinking.</p>
<p>If you arrived to this podcast from a place of partisanship, if you hate Trump, or love Trump,</p>
<p>or any other political leader, no matter what he or they do, and see everyone who disagrees with</p>
<p>you as delusional, I ask that you unsubscribe, and don&rsquo;t listen to these conversations, because my</p>
<p>hope is to go beyond that kind of divisive thinking. I think we can only make progress</p>
<p>toward truth through deep, empathetic thinking and conversation, and as always, love.</p>

<p>people around the world. And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Sheldon Solomon.</p>
<p>What is the role of death and fear of death in life?</p>
<p>Well, from our perspective, the uniquely human awareness of death and our unwillingness to accept</p>
<p>that fact, we would argue, is the primary motivational impetus for almost everything</p>
<p>that people do, whether they&rsquo;re aware of it or not.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of been your life work. Your view of the human condition is that death,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve written the book Warm at the Core, that death is at the core of our</p>
<p>consciousness of everything, of how we see the world, of what drives us. Maybe can you,</p>
<p>can you elaborate how you see death fitting in? What does it mean to be at the core of our being?</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s a great question. And, you know, to be pedantic, I usually start,</p>
<p>you know, my psychology classes and I say to the students, okay, you know, let&rsquo;s define our terms.</p>
<p>And the ology part, they get right away. You know, it&rsquo;s the study of, and then we get to the psyche</p>
<p>part. And understandably, you know, the students are like, oh, that means mind. And I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>well, no, that&rsquo;s a modern interpretation. But in ancient Greek, it means soul, but not in the</p>
<p>Cartesian dualistic sense that most of us in the West think when that word comes to mind.</p>
<p>And so you hear the word soul and you&rsquo;re like, well, all right, that&rsquo;s the nonphysical part of</p>
<p>me that&rsquo;s potentially detachable from my corporal container when I&rsquo;m no longer here. But Aristotle&rsquo;s</p>
<p>who coined the word psyche, I think, he was not a dualist. He was a monist. He thought that the soul</p>
<p>was inextricably connected to the body. And he defined soul as the essence of a natural body</p>
<p>that is alive. And then he goes on and he says, all right, let me give you an example. If an</p>
<p>axe was alive, the soul of an axe would be to chop. And if you can pluck your eyeball out of</p>
<p>your head and it was still functioning, then the soul of the eyeball would be to see, you know,</p>
<p>and then he&rsquo;s like, all right, the soul of a grasshopper is to hop. The soul of a woodpecker</p>
<p>is to pack, which raises the question, of course, what is the essence of what it means to be human?</p>
<p>And here, of course, there is no one universally accepted conception of the essence of our humanity.</p>
<p>All right, Aristotle, you know, gives us the idea of humans as rational animals. You know, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>homo sapiens. But not the only game in town got Joseph Heusinger, an anthropologist in the 20th</p>
<p>century. He called us homo ludens that were basically fundamentally playful creatures. And</p>
<p>I think it was Hannah Arendt, homo faber, were tool making creatures. Another woman,</p>
<p>Ellen Dizanayake, wrote a book called Homo Aestheticus. And following Aristotle and his</p>
<p>poetics, she&rsquo;s like, well, we&rsquo;re not only rational animals, we&rsquo;re also aesthetic creatures that</p>
<p>appreciate beauty. There&rsquo;s another take on humans. I think they call us homo narratans.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re storytelling creatures. And I think all of those designations of what it means to be human</p>
<p>are quite useful heuristically and certainly worthy of our collective cogitation. But what</p>
<p>garnered my attention when I was a young punk was just a single line in an essay by a Scottish guy,</p>
<p>who was Alexander Smith, in a book called Dreamthwarp. I think it&rsquo;s written in the 1860s.</p>
<p>He just says right in the middle of an essay, it is our knowledge that we have to die that makes</p>
<p>us human. And I remember reading that. And in my gut, I was like, oh, man, I don&rsquo;t like that. But</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re onto something. And then William James, the great Harvard philosopher and arguably</p>
<p>the first academic psychologist, he referred to death as the worm at the core of the human</p>
<p>condition. So that&rsquo;s where the worm at the core idea comes in. And that&rsquo;s just an allusion to</p>
<p>the story of Genesis back in the proverbial old days in the Garden of Eden. Everything was going</p>
<p>tremendously well until the serpent tempts Eve to take a chop out of the apple of the tree of</p>
<p>knowledge, and Adam partakes also. And this is, according to the Bible, what brings death into</p>
<p>the world. And from our vantage point, the story of Genesis is a remarkable allegorical recount of</p>
<p>the origin of consciousness, where we get to the point where, by virtue of our vast intelligence,</p>
<p>we come to realize the inevitability of death. And so, you know, the apple is beautiful and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tasty. But when you get right into the middle of it, there&rsquo;s that ugly reality, which is our</p>
<p>finitude. And then fast forward a bit, and I was a young professor at Skidmore College in 1980.</p>
<p>My PhD is in experimental social psychology, and I mainly did studies for the study of the</p>
<p>world. I mainly did studies with clinical psychologists evaluating the efficacy of</p>
<p>nonpharmacological interventions to reduce stress. And that was good work, and I found it</p>
<p>interesting. But in my first week as a professor at Skidmore, I&rsquo;m just walking up and down the</p>
<p>shelves of the library, saw some books by a guy I had never heard of, Ernest Becker, a cultural</p>
<p>scientist, recently deceased. He died in 1974. After weeks before, actually, he was posthumously</p>
<p>awarded the Pulitzer Prize in Nonfiction for his book, The Denial of Death.</p>
<p>And that was his last book?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually his next to last book. I don&rsquo;t know how you pull this off, but he had one more</p>
<p>after he died called Escape from Evil. And evidently, it was supposed to&hellip; Originally,</p>
<p>The Denial of Death was supposed to be this giant thousand page book that was both,</p>
<p>and they split it up, and what became Escape from Evil, his wife, Marie Becker, finished.</p>
<p>Well, be that as it may, it is in The Denial of Death where Becker just says in the first paragraph,</p>
<p>I believe that the terror of death and the way that human beings respond to it or decline</p>
<p>to respond to it is primarily responsible for almost everything we do, whether we&rsquo;re aware of</p>
<p>it or not, and mostly we&rsquo;re not. And so I read that first paragraph, Lex, and I was like, wow,</p>
<p>okay, this dude&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re onto something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing. And then it reminded me, I think, not to play psychologist, but</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s face it, I believe there&rsquo;s a reason why we end up drifting where we ultimately come to. So</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in my mid 20s. I got Ernest Becker&rsquo;s book in my hand. And the next thing I know, I&rsquo;m remembering</p>
<p>that when I&rsquo;m eight years old, the day that my grandmother died. And the day before, my mom said,</p>
<p>oh, say goodbye to grandma. She&rsquo;s not well. And so I was like, okay, grandma. And I knew she wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>well, but I didn&rsquo;t really appreciate the magnitude of her illness. Well, she dies the next day.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s in the evening and I&rsquo;m just sitting there looking at my stamp collection. And I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like, wow, I&rsquo;m going to miss my grandmother. And then I&rsquo;m like, no, wait a minute. That means my</p>
<p>mother&rsquo;s going to die after she gets old. And that&rsquo;s even worse. After all, who&rsquo;s going to make</p>
<p>me dinner? And that bothered me for a while. But then I&rsquo;m looking at the stamps, all the dead</p>
<p>American presidents. And I&rsquo;m like, there&rsquo;s George Washington. He&rsquo;s dead. There&rsquo;s Thomas Jefferson.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s dead. My mom&rsquo;s going to be dead. Oh, I&rsquo;m going to get old and be dead someday. And at</p>
<p>eight years old, that was my first explicit existential crisis. I remember it being,</p>
<p>you know, one of these blood curdling realizations that I tried my best to ignore for the most of the</p>
<p>time I was subsequently growing up. But fast forward back to Skidmore College, mid twenties,</p>
<p>you know, reading Becker&rsquo;s book in the 1980s, thinking to myself, wow, one of the reasons</p>
<p>why I&rsquo;m finding this so compelling is that it squares with my own personal experience.</p>
<p>And then to make a short story long, and I&rsquo;ll shut up, Lex, but what grabbed me about Becker,</p>
<p>and this is in part because I read a lot of his other books, there&rsquo;s another book, The Birth and</p>
<p>Death of Meaning, which is framed in from an evolutionary perspective. And then The Denial</p>
<p>of Death is really more framed from an existential psychodynamic vantage point. And as a young</p>
<p>academic, I was really taken by what I found to be a very potent juxtaposition that you really don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see that often. Yet usually evolutionary types are eager to dismiss the psychodynamic types</p>
<p>and vice versa. And maybe only John Bowlby, you know, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s other folks. But</p>
<p>the attachment theorist, John Bowlby, was really one of the first serious academics to say these</p>
<p>these ways of thinking about things are quite compatible.</p>
<p>And can you comment on what&rsquo;s what a psychodynamics view of the world is versus an evolutionary view</p>
<p>of the world, just in case people are not?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, absolutely. That&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a fine question. Well, for the evolutionary types</p>
<p>in general are interested in how it is and why it is that we have adapted to our surroundings</p>
<p>in the service of persisting over time and being represented in the gene pool thereafter.</p>
<p>You used to be a fish. Yeah, we used to be a fish. And I&rsquo;ll end up talking on a podcast.</p>
<p>Yeah. How we came to be that way.</p>
<p>How we came to be that way. And so whereas the existential psychodynamic types, I would say,</p>
<p>are more interested in development across a single lifespan. And but but the evolutionary</p>
<p>types dismiss the psychodynamic types as overly speculative and devoid of empirical support for</p>
<p>their views. They, you know, they&rsquo;ll just say these guys are talking shit, if you&rsquo;ll pardon</p>
<p>the expression. And of course, you can turn right around and say the same about the evolutionary</p>
<p>types that they are often and rightfully criticized evolutionary psychologists for what are called the</p>
<p>just so stories that where it&rsquo;s like, oh, this is probably why fill in the blank is potentially</p>
<p>adaptive. And my thought again early on was I didn&rsquo;t see any intrinsic antithesis between</p>
<p>these viewpoints. I just found them dialectically compatible and very powerful when combined.</p>
<p>So one question I would ask here is about a science being speculative. You know,</p>
<p>we understand a little about the human mind. You said you picked up Becker&rsquo;s book and, you know,</p>
<p>it felt like it was onto something. That&rsquo;s the same thing I felt when I picked up Becker&rsquo;s book,</p>
<p>probably also in my early 20s. You know, I read a lot of philosophy, but it felt like the question</p>
<p>of the meaning of life kind of, you know, this seemed to be the most the closest to the truth</p>
<p>somehow. It was onto something. So I guess the question I want to ask also is like how speculative</p>
<p>is psychology? How like all of your life&rsquo;s work? How do you feel? How confident do you feel about</p>
<p>the whole thing? About understanding our mind? I feel confidently unconfident to have both ways.</p>
<p>Like what do we make of psychology? What do we make starting with Freud, you know,</p>
<p>starting just our, or even just philosophy, even the aspects of the sciences, like, you know,</p>
<p>my field of artificial intelligence, but also physics, you know, it often feels like, man,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t really understand most of what&rsquo;s going on here. And certainly that&rsquo;s true with the human</p>
<p>mind. Yeah. Well, to me, that&rsquo;s the proper epistemological stance. I don&rsquo;t know anything.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s the Socratic I know that I don&rsquo;t know, which is the first step on the path to wisdom.</p>
<p>I would argue forcefully that we know a lot more than we used to. I would argue equally forcefully,</p>
<p>but not that I have a PhD in the philosophy of science, but I believe that the Thomas</p>
<p>Kuhns of the world are right when they point out that change is not necessarily progress.</p>
<p>And so on the one hand, I do think we know a lot more than we did back in the day when if you</p>
<p>wanted to fly, you put on some wax wings and jumped off a mountain. On the other hand, I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s quite arrogant when scientists, I&rsquo;ll just speak about psychological scientists, when they</p>
<p>have the audacity to mistake statistical precision for knowledge and insight. And when they make the</p>
<p>mistake, in my estimation, that Einstein bemoaned, and that&rsquo;s this idea that the mere accumulation</p>
<p>of data will necessarily result in conceptual breakthroughs. And so I like the, well, we&rsquo;re all,</p>
<p>I hope, appreciative of the people who trained us. But I remember my first day in graduate school at</p>
<p>the University of Kansas, they brought us into a room and on one side of the board was a quote by</p>
<p>Kurt Lewin or Levine, famous German social psychologist. And the quote is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing more useful than a good theory. And then on the other side was another quote by</p>
<p>a German physicist, his name eludes me, and it was all theories are wrong. And I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>which is it? And of course, the point is that it&rsquo;s both. Our theories are, I believe,</p>
<p>powerful ways to direct our attention to aspects of human affairs that might render us better able</p>
<p>to understand ourselves in the world around us. Now, I also, as an experimental psychologist,</p>
<p>I adhere to the view that theories are essentially hypothesis generating devices.</p>
<p>And that at its best, science is a dialectical interplay where you have theoretical assertions</p>
<p>that yield testable hypotheses and that either results in the corroboration of the theory,</p>
<p>the rejection of it or the modification thereafter. If we look at the existentialists</p>
<p>or even like modern philosopher, psychologist types like Jordan Peterson, I&rsquo;m not sure if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re familiar with Jordan pretty well. We go way back. Actually, if he were here with us today,</p>
<p>we would he would be jumping in and I believe very interesting and important ways. But yeah,</p>
<p>we go back 30 years ago. He was basically saying our work is nonsense. Let&rsquo;s get into this. I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>talk to Jordan eventually on this thing. Yeah, there&rsquo;s some rough times right now. Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>And I and I wish him well. Jordan was working on his maps of meaning and we were publishing our</p>
<p>work. And I think Jordan at the time was concerned about our vague claims to the effect that all</p>
<p>meaning is arbitrary. He takes a more Jungian as well as evolutionary view that I don&rsquo;t think is</p>
<p>wrong, by the way, which is that there are certain kinds of meanings that are more important,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say religious types, and that we didn&rsquo;t pay sufficient attention to that in our early days.</p>
<p>So can you try to elucidate like what his worldview is? Because he&rsquo;s also a religious man.</p>
<p>And so what what was this? What was some of the interesting aspects of the disagreements</p>
<p>that then? Yeah, well, back in the day, I just said, you know, Jordan was a young punk. We were</p>
<p>young punks. He was just kind of flailing in an animated way at some conferences saying that</p>
<p>we you&rsquo;re still both kind of punks. Yeah, we are kind of punk. So I saw him three or four years</p>
<p>ago. We spoke on a it was an awesome day. We&rsquo;re in Canada at the Ontario Shakespeare Festival,</p>
<p>where we were asked to be on a Canadian broadcast system program. I think we were talking about</p>
<p>Macbeth from a psychodynamic perspective. And I hadn&rsquo;t seen him in a ton of years. And we spent</p>
<p>two days together, had a great time. You know, we had just written our book, The Worm at the Core.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, you know, you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re missing a big opportunity. Every time you say something,</p>
<p>you have to have your phone and you have to film yourself and then you have to put it on YouTube.</p>
<p>Yeah, he was onto something that, you know, that just as a small tangent. Yeah. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>sad to look at Jordan Peterson and somebody like yourself. After having done this podcast,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve realized that there is really brilliant people in this world. And oftentimes, especially</p>
<p>like when they&rsquo;re, I mean, it would love are a little bit like punks. That&rsquo;s right. They kind</p>
<p>of do their own thing and make the world doesn&rsquo;t know they exist as much as they should. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so interesting because most people are kind of boring. Yes. And then the interesting ones kind</p>
<p>of go on their own. And there&rsquo;s not a smartphone. No, that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s so interesting. He was onto</p>
<p>something that I mean, it&rsquo;s interesting that I don&rsquo;t think he was thinking from a money perspective,</p>
<p>but he was probably thinking of like connecting with people or sharing his knowledge.</p>
<p>But people don&rsquo;t often think that way. That&rsquo;s right. So maybe we can try to get back to you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>both brilliant people. And I&rsquo;d love to get some interesting disagreements earlier and later about</p>
<p>in your psychological work and your world views. Well, our disagreements today would be</p>
<p>along two dimensions. One is he is and again, I wish he was here to correct me. Yes. When I say</p>
<p>that he is more committed to the virtues of the Judeo Christian tradition, I see particularly</p>
<p>Christianity and in a sense is a contemporary Kierkegaard of sorts when he&rsquo;s saying there&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>one way to leap into faith. And I would take ardent issue with that claim on the grounds that</p>
<p>that is one, but by no means not the only way to find meaning and value in life. And so and I see</p>
<p>his. What&rsquo;s his warm at the core? What is like? So we&rsquo;re talking about a little bit of a higher</p>
<p>level of discovering meaning. Yeah. What&rsquo;s his? What does he make of death? Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And this is where it would be nice to have him here. He has, you know, from a distance criticized</p>
<p>our work as misguided. Having said that, though, when we were together, he said something along</p>
<p>the lines that there is no theoretical body of work in academic psychology right now for which</p>
<p>there is more empirical evidence. And so I appreciated that. He&rsquo;s a great researcher. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a good clinician. The other thing that we will agree to disagree about rather vociferously is</p>
<p>his ultimately political slash economic. So I remember being at dinner with him,</p>
<p>telling him that the next book that I wanted to write was going to be called Why Left and Right</p>
<p>are Both Beside the Point. And my argument was going to be and it is going to be that both</p>
<p>liberal and political liberal and conservative political philosophy are each intellectually and</p>
<p>morally bankrupt because they&rsquo;re both framed in terms of assumptions about human nature that are</p>
<p>demonstrably false. And Jordan didn&rsquo;t mind me knocking liberal political philosophy on those</p>
<p>grounds. That would basically be like Steven Pinker&rsquo;s blank slate. But he took issue when</p>
<p>I pointed out that actually it&rsquo;s conservative political philosophy, which starts with John</p>
<p>Locke&rsquo;s assumption that in a state of nature, there are no societies, just autonomous individuals</p>
<p>who are striving for survival. That&rsquo;s one of the most obviously patently wrong assertions in the</p>
<p>history of intellectual thought. And Locke uses that to justify his claims about the individual</p>
<p>right to acquire unlimited amounts of property, which is ultimately the justification for</p>
<p>neoliberal economics. Can you linger on that a little bit? Can you describe his philosophy</p>
<p>again as view of the world and what neoliberal economics is? Yeah, let me translate it in</p>
<p>English. So basically on all these days, anybody who says I&rsquo;m a conservative free market type,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re following John Locke and Adam Smith, whether you&rsquo;re aware of it or not. So here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>John Locke, who, by the way, all of these guys are great. So for me to appear to criticize any</p>
<p>of these folks, it is with the highest regard. And also, we need to understand in my estimation</p>
<p>how important their ideas are. Locke is working in a time where all rule was top down by divine</p>
<p>right. And he&rsquo;s trying desperately to come up with a philosophical justification to shift power</p>
<p>and autonomy to individuals. And he starts in his second treatise on government, 1690 or so,</p>
<p>he says, okay, let&rsquo;s start with a state of nature. And he&rsquo;s like, in a state of nature,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no societies, there&rsquo;s just individuals. And in a perfect universe,</p>
<p>there wouldn&rsquo;t be any societies, there would just be individuals who by the law of nature have a</p>
<p>right to survive. And in the service of survival, they have the right to acquire and preserve the</p>
<p>fruits of their own labor. But his point is, and it&rsquo;s actually a good one, he&rsquo;s following Hobbes</p>
<p>here. He&rsquo;s like, well, the problem with that is that people are assholes. And if they would</p>
<p>let each other alone, then we would still be living in a state of nature, everybody just</p>
<p>doing what they did to get by each day. But it&rsquo;s a whole lot easier if I see like an apple tree</p>
<p>a mile away. Well, I can go over and pick an apple. But if you&rsquo;re 10 meters away with an apple</p>
<p>in your hand, it&rsquo;s a lot easier if I pick up a rock and crack your head and take the apple.</p>
<p>And his point was that the problem is that people can&rsquo;t be counted on to behave. They will take each</p>
<p>other&rsquo;s property. Moreover, he argued, if someone takes your property, you have the right to retribution</p>
<p>in proportion to the degree of the magnitude of the transgression. English translation,</p>
<p>if I take your apple, you have the right to take an apple back. You don&rsquo;t have the right to kill</p>
<p>my firstborn. But people being people, they&rsquo;re apt to escalate retaliatory behavior, thus creating</p>
<p>what Locke called a state of war. So he said, in order to avoid a state of war, people reluctantly</p>
<p>give up their freedom in exchange for security. They agree to obey the law and that the sole</p>
<p>function of government is to keep domestic tranquility and to ward off foreign invasion in</p>
<p>order to protect our right to property. All right. So now here&rsquo;s the property thing. All right. So</p>
<p>Locke says, if you look in the Bible and in nature, there is no private property.</p>
<p>But Locke says, well, surely if there&rsquo;s anything that you own, it&rsquo;s your body. And surely you have</p>
<p>a right by nature to stay alive. And then by extension, anything that you do where you exert</p>
<p>effort or labor, that becomes your private property. So back to the apple tree. If I walk</p>
<p>over to an apple tree, that&rsquo;s everybody&rsquo;s apples until I pick one. And the minute I do,</p>
<p>that is my apple. And then he says, you can have as many apples as you want, as long as you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>waste them. And as long as you don&rsquo;t impinge on somebody else&rsquo;s right to get apples. So far,</p>
<p>so good. Yep. And then he says, well, okay. In the early days, you could only eat so many apples</p>
<p>or you could only trade so many apples with somebody else. So he was like, well, if you put</p>
<p>a fence around a bunch of apple trees, those become your apples. That&rsquo;s your property.</p>
<p>Those become your apples. That&rsquo;s your property. If somebody else wants to put a fence around</p>
<p>Nebraska, that&rsquo;s their property. And everybody can have as much property as they want because</p>
<p>the world is so big that there is no limit to what you can have if you pursue it by virtue of</p>
<p>your own effort. But then he says money came into the picture. And this is important because he</p>
<p>noticed long before anybody, before the Freud&rsquo;s of the world, that money is funky because it has no</p>
<p>intrinsic value. He&rsquo;s like, ooh, look at that shiny piece of metal that actually has, if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>hungry and you have a choice between a carrot and a lump of gold in the desert, most people are</p>
<p>going to go for the carrot. But his point is that the allure of money is that it&rsquo;s basically a</p>
<p>concentrated symbol of wealth, but because it doesn&rsquo;t spoil, Locke said, you&rsquo;re entitled to</p>
<p>have as much money as you&rsquo;re able to garner. Then he says, well, the reality is that some people</p>
<p>are more, the word that he used was industrious. He said some people more industrious than others.</p>
<p>All right, today we would say smarter, less lazy, more ambitious. He just said that&rsquo;s natural. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also true. Therefore, he argued, over time, some people are going to have a whole lot of property</p>
<p>and other people not much at all. Inequality for Locke is natural and beneficial for everyone.</p>
<p>His argument was that the rising tide lifts all boats and that the truly creative and innovative</p>
<p>are entitled to relatively unlimited worth because we&rsquo;re all better off as a result.</p>
<p>So the point very simply is that, and then you have Adam Smith in the next century with the</p>
<p>invisible hand where Adam Smith says, everyone pursuing their own selfish, that&rsquo;s not necessarily</p>
<p>pejorative, if everyone pursues their own selfish interests, we will all be better off as a result.</p>
<p>And what do you think is the flaw in that way of thinking?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s two flaws. One flaw is, first of all, that it is based on an erroneous assumption</p>
<p>to begin with, which is that there never was a time in human history when we were an asocial</p>
<p>species.</p>
<p>In a sense, you don&rsquo;t feel like there&rsquo;s this emphasis of individual autonomy is a flawed</p>
<p>promise. There&rsquo;s something fundamentally deeply interconnected between us.</p>
<p>I do. I think that Plato and Socrates in the Crito were closer to the truth when they started</p>
<p>with the assumption that we were interdependent, then they derived individual autonomy as a</p>
<p>manifestation of a functional social system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>So when Margaret Thatcher, you&rsquo;re too young, in the 1980s, she said, societies? There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no such thing as societies. There&rsquo;s just individuals pursuing their self interest.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one point where I would take issue respectfully with John Locke.</p>
<p>Point number two is when Locke says in 1690, well, England&rsquo;s filled up, so if you want</p>
<p>some land, just go to America, it&rsquo;s empty. Or maybe there&rsquo;s a few savages there, just</p>
<p>kill them.</p>
<p>So Melville does the same thing in Moby Dick where he thinks about, will there ever come</p>
<p>a time where we run out of whales? And he says, no, but we have run out of whales.</p>
<p>And so Locke was right maybe in 1690 that the world was large and had infinite resources.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s certainly wrong today, in my opinion. Also wrong is the claim that the unlimited</p>
<p>pursuit of personal wealth does not harm those around us. There is no doubt that radical</p>
<p>inequality is tragic psychologically and physically. Poverty is not that terrible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy for me to say because I have a place to stay and something to eat. But as</p>
<p>long as you&rsquo;re not starving and have a place to be, poverty is not as challenging as having</p>
<p>the impoverished in close proximity to those who are obscenely wealthy.</p>
<p>LW So it&rsquo;s not the absolute measure of your</p>
<p>well being, it&rsquo;s the inequality of that well being is the penalty painful.</p>
<p>So maybe just to linger on the Jordan Peterson thing, in terms of your disagreement in his</p>
<p>world view. So he went through quite a bit, there&rsquo;s been quite a bit of fire in his defense</p>
<p>or maybe his opposition of the idea of equality of outcomes. So looking at the inequality</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in our world, looking at, you know, certain groups, measurably having an outcome</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s different than other groups, and then drawing conclusions about fundamental</p>
<p>unfairness, injustice, inequality in the system. So like systematic racism, systematic sexism,</p>
<p>systematic anything else that creates inequality. And he&rsquo;s been kind of saying pretty simple</p>
<p>things to say that, you know, the system for the most part is not broken or flawed,</p>
<p>that the inequalities part, the inequality of outcomes is part of our world. What we</p>
<p>should strive for is the, you know, equality of opportunity.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I do not dispute that as an abstraction. But again, to back up for a second, I do take</p>
<p>issue with Jordan&rsquo;s fervent devotion to the free market and his cavalier dismissal of</p>
<p>Marxist ideas, which he has, in my estimation, mischaracterized in his public depictions.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get into it. So he just seems to really not like socialism, Marxism, communism.</p>
<p>Historically speaking, sort of, I mean, how would I characterize it? I&rsquo;m not exactly sure.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to, again, he&rsquo;ll eventually be here to defend himself. John Locke, unfortunately,</p>
<p>not here to defend himself. But what&rsquo;s your sense about Marxism and the way Jordan talks</p>
<p>about it, the way you think about it, from the economics, from the philosophical perspective?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, if we were all here together, I&rsquo;d say we need to start with Marx&rsquo;s economic and</p>
<p>philosophical manuscripts of 1844, before Marx became more of a polemicist. And I would argue</p>
<p>that Marx&rsquo;s political philosophy, he&rsquo;s a crappy economist, I don&rsquo;t dispute that. But his arguments</p>
<p>about human nature, his arguments about the inevitably catastrophic psychological</p>
<p>and environmental and economic effects of capitalism, I would argue every one of those</p>
<p>has proven quite right. Marx maybe did not have the answer, but he saw in the 18, whenever he</p>
<p>was writing, that inevitably, capitalism would lead to massive inequity, that it was ultimately</p>
<p>based on the need to denigrate and dehumanize labor, to render them, in his language, a fleshy</p>
<p>cog in a giant machine. And it would create a tension and conflict between those who own things</p>
<p>and those who made things, that over time would always, the Thomas Pickardy guy who writes about</p>
<p>capital, and just makes the point that return on investment will always be greater than wages. That</p>
<p>means the people with money are gonna have a lot more. That means there&rsquo;s gonna come a point where</p>
<p>the economic house of cards falls apart. Now, the Joseph Schumpeters of the world, they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s creative destruction, bring it, that&rsquo;s great. So I think it&rsquo;s Niles Ferguson, he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>historian, he may be at Stanford now, he was at Harvard. He writes about the history of money,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like, yeah, there&rsquo;s been 20 or whatever depressions and big recessions in the last several</p>
<p>hundred years. And when that happens, half of the population or whatever is catastrophically</p>
<p>inconvenienced. But that&rsquo;s the price that we pay for progress. Other people would argue, and I</p>
<p>would agree with them that I will happily sacrifice the rate of progress in order to flatten</p>
<p>the curve of economic destruction. To put that in plainer English, I would direct our attention</p>
<p>to the social democracies that forgetting for the moment of whether it&rsquo;s possible to do this on a</p>
<p>scale in a country as big as ours, on all of the things that really matter, gross, domestic GDP</p>
<p>or whatever, that&rsquo;s just an abstraction. But when you look at whatever the United Nations says,</p>
<p>how we measure quality of life, life expectancy, education, rates of alcoholism, suicide, and so on,</p>
<p>the countries that do better are the mixed economies. They&rsquo;re market economies</p>
<p>that have high tax rates in exchange for the provision of services that come as a right</p>
<p>for citizens. Yeah, so I mean, I guess the question is, you&rsquo;ve kind of mentioned that, you know,</p>
<p>as Marx described, capitalism with a slippery slope, eventually things go awry in some kind</p>
<p>of way. So that&rsquo;s the question is, when you have, when you implement a system, how does it go wrong</p>
<p>eventually? You know, eventually we&rsquo;ll all be dead. That&rsquo;s exactly right. No, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So, and then the criticism, I mean, I think these days, unfortunately, Marxism is a dirty word.</p>
<p>I say unfortunately, because even if you disagree with a philosophy, you should, like calling</p>
<p>somebody a Marxist should not be a thing that shuts down all conversation. No, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And the fact is, I&rsquo;m sympathetic with Jordan&rsquo;s dismissal of the folks, the talking heads these</p>
<p>days who spew Marxist words. To me, it&rsquo;s like fashionable nonsense. Do you know that book that</p>
<p>the physicists wrote mocking? You&rsquo;re too young. So in the 20 or so years, we&rsquo;re all pretty young.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, that&rsquo;s right. But I think there were these NYU physicists, they wrote a paper just</p>
<p>mocking the kind of literary postmodern types. And it was, oh, those kinds of, yeah, it was just</p>
<p>nonsense. And of course it was made the lead article. And you know, my point is Marx wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be a Marxist. True. I have read and listened to some of the work of Richard Wolff. He speaks</p>
<p>pretty eloquently about Marxism. I like him. He&rsquo;s one of the only, you know, one of the only people</p>
<p>speaking about a lot about Marxism and the way we are now in a serious way, in a sort of saying,</p>
<p>you know, what are the flaws of capitalism? Not saying like, yeah, basically sounding very</p>
<p>different. People should check out his work. Because all this kind of work, this kind of</p>
<p>outrage mob culture of sort of demanding equality of outcome, that&rsquo;s not Marxism.</p>
<p>It is not Marxism. He didn&rsquo;t say that. You know, he literally said each, what was it like,</p>
<p>each according to their needs and each according to their abilities or something like that.</p>
<p>So the question is the implementation, like, humans are messy. So how does it go wrong?</p>
<p>Like, it is, there you go, Lex. Brilliant. It&rsquo;s messy. And this gets back to my rant about</p>
<p>the book that I want to try if I don&rsquo;t stroke out, why left and right are both beside the point.</p>
<p>You know, the people, the conservatives are right when they condemn liberals for being simple minded.</p>
<p>By assuming that a modification of external conditions will yield changes in human nature.</p>
<p>You know, again, that&rsquo;s where Marx and Skinner are odd bedfellows. You know, here they are just</p>
<p>saying, oh, let&rsquo;s change the surroundings and things will inevitably get better. On the other</p>
<p>hand, when conservatives say that people are innately selfish and they use that as the</p>
<p>justification for glorifying the unbridled pursuit of wealth, well, they&rsquo;re only half right because</p>
<p>it turns out that we can be innately selfish, but we are also innately generous and reciprocating</p>
<p>creatures. There&rsquo;s remarkable studies, I think they&rsquo;ve been done at Yale, of, you know, babies,</p>
<p>14 month old babies. If someone hands them a toy and then wants something in return,</p>
<p>babies before they can walk and talk will reciprocate. All right, fine.</p>
<p>If someone, if they want a toy, let&rsquo;s say, or a bottle of water, baby wants a bottle of water,</p>
<p>and I look like I&rsquo;m trying to give it to the baby, but I drop the bottle so the baby doesn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>what she or he wanted. When given a chance to reciprocate, little babies will reciprocate</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re aware of and are responding to intention. Similarly, if they see somebody</p>
<p>behaving unfairly to someone, they will not help that person in return. So my point is,</p>
<p>yeah, we are selfish creatures at times, but we are also simultaneously ubersocial creatures</p>
<p>who are eager to reciprocate, and in fact, we&rsquo;re congenitally prepared to be reciprocators to the</p>
<p>point where we will reciprocate on the basis of intentions above and beyond what actually happens.</p>
<p>How close, so, I mean, your work is on the fundamental role of the fear of mortality in</p>
<p>ourselves. How fundamental is this reciprocation, this human connection to other humans?</p>
<p>Oh, I think it&rsquo;s really innate. Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s because, yeah, bats reciprocate, not by intention,</p>
<p>but, you know, this, I&rsquo;m going here from Richard Dawkins, The Selfish Gene, you know, to, I love</p>
<p>the early Dawkins, I&rsquo;m less enamored. I like the early Beatles.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, no, no. And again, I say this with great respect, but, you know, Dawkins just points out</p>
<p>that, you know, reciprocation is just fundamental, cooperation is fundamental. You know, it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>one sided view of evolutionary takes on things when we see it solely in terms of individual</p>
<p>competition. It&rsquo;s almost, from a game theoretic perspective too, it&rsquo;s just easier to see the world</p>
<p>that way. It&rsquo;s easier to, I don&rsquo;t know, I mean, you see this in physics, there&rsquo;s a whole field of</p>
<p>folks, like complexity, that kind of embrace the fact that it&rsquo;s all an intricately connected mess,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just very difficult to do anything with that kind of science. But it seems to be much</p>
<p>closer to actually representing what the world is like.</p>
<p>So like you put it earlier, Lex, it&rsquo;s messy.</p>
<p>So left and right, you mentioned, you&rsquo;re thinking of maybe actually putting it down on paper</p>
<p>or something?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would like to, because what I would like to point out, again, in admiration of all the</p>
<p>people that I will then try and have the gall to criticize is, look, these are all geniuses.</p>
<p>Locke, genius. Adam Smith, genius, when he uses the notion that we&rsquo;re bartering creatures. So he uses</p>
<p>that reciprocation idea as the basis of his way of thinking about things.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not at the core. The bartering is not at the core of human nature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not at, well, he says it is. He says we&rsquo;re fundamentally bartering creatures.</p>
<p>Well, that doesn&rsquo;t even make sense then, because then how can we then be autonomous individuals</p>
<p>autonomous individuals?</p>
<p>Well, because we&rsquo;re going to barter with an eye on</p>
<p>for ourselves, self interest.</p>
<p>Yeah. But all right. So, but back to Adam Smith for a second, Lex. He&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>Adam Smith, here&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s got the invisible hand and my conservative friends. I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>you need to read his books because he is a big fan of the free market. And this is my other gripe</p>
<p>with folks who support just unbridled markets. Adam Smith understood that there was a role</p>
<p>for government for two reasons. One is, is that just like Locke, people are not going to behave</p>
<p>with integrity. And he understood that one role of government is to maintain a proverbial,</p>
<p>you know, even playing field. And then the other thing Smith said was that there&rsquo;s some things that</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be done well for a profit. And I believe he talked about education and public health and</p>
<p>infrastructure as things that are best done by governments because you can&rsquo;t, you can make a</p>
<p>profit, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that the institutions themselves will be maximally beneficial.</p>
<p>Yeah. So I would, I&rsquo;m just eager to engage people by saying, let&rsquo;s start with our most</p>
<p>contemporary understanding of human nature, which is that we are both selfish and tend</p>
<p>to cooperate. And we also can be heroically helpful to folks in our own tribe. And of course,</p>
<p>how you define one&rsquo;s tribe becomes critically important. But what some people say is, look,</p>
<p>look, what would then be, what kind of political institutions and what kind of economic organization</p>
<p>can we think about to kind of hit that sweet spot? And that would be, in my opinion,</p>
<p>how do we maximize individual autonomy in a way that fosters creativity and innovation and the</p>
<p>self regard that comes from creative expression while engaging our more cooperative and reciprocal</p>
<p>tendencies in order to come up with a system that is potentially stable over time? Because</p>
<p>the other thing about all capital based systems is the stability. It&rsquo;s fundamentally unstable.</p>
<p>Yeah, because it&rsquo;s based on infinite growth. And it&rsquo;s a positive feedback loop. To be silly,</p>
<p>infinite growth is only good for malignant cancer cells and compound interest. But otherwise,</p>
<p>we want to seek a steady state. So when Steven Pinker writes, for example, again,</p>
<p>great scholar, but I&rsquo;m going to disagree when he says the world has never been better,</p>
<p>and all we need to do is keep making stuff and buying stuff.</p>
<p>So your sense is the world sort of in disagreement with Steven Pinker, that the world is</p>
<p>like facing a potential catastrophic collapse in multiple directions.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And the fact that there are certain like the rate of violence and aggregate is decreasing,</p>
<p>the death, you know, the quality of life, all those kinds of measures that you can plot across</p>
<p>centuries that it&rsquo;s improving. That doesn&rsquo;t capture the fact that our world might be this,</p>
<p>we might destroy ourselves in very painful ways in the in the in the next century.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m with Jared Diamond, you know, in the book Collapse, where he points out studying</p>
<p>the collapse of major civilizations, that it often happens right after things appear to never</p>
<p>have been better. And in that regard, I mean, there are more known voices that have taken issue</p>
<p>with Dr. Pinker. I&rsquo;m thinking of John Gray, who&rsquo;s a British philosopher and here in the States. I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know where he is these days, but Robert J. Lifton, the psycho historian. Yeah, they&rsquo;re both</p>
<p>of my view and which I hope is, by the way, wrong.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, but you know, between, you know, ongoing ethnic tensions, environmental degradation,</p>
<p>economic instability, and the fact that, you know, the world has become a Petri dish of</p>
<p>psychopathology. Like what really worries me is the the quiet economic pain that people are going</p>
<p>through, the businesses that are closed, dreams that are broken, because you can no longer do the</p>
<p>thing that you&rsquo;ve wanted to do and how I mentioned to you off camera that I&rsquo;ve been reading The Rise</p>
<p>and Fall of the Third Reich. And I mean, the amount of anger and hatred and on the flip side of that,</p>
<p>sort of a nationalist pride that can arise from deep economic pain. Like what happens with that</p>
<p>economic pain is you become bitter. You start to find the other, whether it&rsquo;s other European</p>
<p>nations that mistreated you, whether it&rsquo;s other groups that mistreated you, it always ends up</p>
<p>being the Jews somehow or fault here. That&rsquo;s what worries me is where this quiet anger and pain goes</p>
<p>in 2021, 2022, 2030. If you look, sorry to see the parallels. No, no, no. Rise and fall of the</p>
<p>Third Reich, but you know what happens 10, 15 years from now from what&rsquo;s because of the COVID</p>
<p>pandemic that&rsquo;s happening now. And Lex, you make a, I think a really profoundly important point,</p>
<p>you know, back to our work for a bit or Ernest Becker rather, you know, his point is, is that</p>
<p>the way that we manage existential terror is to embrace culturally constructed belief systems</p>
<p>that give us a sense that life has meaning and we have value. And in the form of self esteem,</p>
<p>which we get from perceiving that we meet or exceed the expectations associated with the role</p>
<p>that we play in society. Well, here we are right now in a world where first of all, if you have</p>
<p>nothing, you are nothing. And secondly, as you were saying before we got started today,</p>
<p>a lot of jobs are gone and they&rsquo;re not coming back. And that&rsquo;s the, where the self esteem,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where the self esteem and identity come in with people. It&rsquo;s not only that you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>anything to eat. You don&rsquo;t even have a self anymore to speak of because the, we typically</p>
<p>define ourselves, you know, as Marx put it, you are what you do. And now who are you when your way</p>
<p>of life, as well as your way of earning a living is no longer available?</p>
<p>Yeah. And it feels like that yearning for self esteem that we could talk a little bit more,</p>
<p>because you about defining self esteem is quite interesting. The more I&rsquo;ve read Warm at the Core</p>
<p>and just in general, your thinking, it made me realize I haven&rsquo;t thought enough about the idea</p>
<p>of self esteem. But the thing I want to say is, it feels like when you lose your self esteem,</p>
<p>it feels like when you lose your job, then it&rsquo;s easy to find, it&rsquo;s tempting to find that self</p>
<p>esteem in a tribe that&rsquo;s not somehow often positive. It&rsquo;s like a tribe that defines itself</p>
<p>on the hatred of somebody else.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s brilliant. And this is what John Gray, the philosopher in the 1990s,</p>
<p>predicted what&rsquo;s happening today. He wrote a book about globalism. And actually Hannah Arendt in</p>
<p>the 1950s said the same thing in her book about totalitarianism. When she said that, you know,</p>
<p>that economics has reached the point where most money is made, not by actually making stuff,</p>
<p>you know, you use money to make money. And therefore, what happens is money chases money</p>
<p>across national boundaries. Ultimately, governments become subordinate to the corporate</p>
<p>entities whose sole function is to generate money. And what John Gray said is that that will</p>
<p>inevitably produce economic upheaval in local areas, which will not be attributed to the</p>
<p>economic order. It will be misattributed to whoever the scapegoat du jour is, and the anger</p>
<p>and the distress associated with that uncertainty will be picked up on by ideological demagogues</p>
<p>who will transform that into rage. So both Hannah Arendt as well as John Gray, they just said,</p>
<p>watch out, we&rsquo;re gonna have right wingish populist movements where demagogues who are the alchemists</p>
<p>of hate, what makes them brilliant is they don&rsquo;t, the hate&rsquo;s already there, but they take the fears</p>
<p>and they expertly redirect them to who it is that I need to hate and kill in order to feel</p>
<p>good about myself. So back to your point, Lex, that&rsquo;s right. So the self regard that used to come</p>
<p>from having a job and doing it well, and as a result of that, having adequate resources to</p>
<p>provide a decent life for your family, well, those opportunities are gone. And yeah, what&rsquo;s left?</p>
<p>So Max Weber, German sociologist at the beginning of the 20th century, he said in times of historical</p>
<p>upheaval, we are apt to embrace, he was the one who coined the term charismatic leader, seemingly</p>
<p>larger than life individuals who often believe or their followers believe are divinely ordained to</p>
<p>rid the world of evil. All right, now, Ernest Becker, he used Weber&rsquo;s ideas in order to account</p>
<p>for the rise of Hitler. Hitler was elected, and he was elected when Germans were in an extraordinary</p>
<p>state of existential distress, and he said, I&rsquo;m gonna make Germany great again. All right, now,</p>
<p>what Becker adds to the equation is his claim that what underlies our affection for charismatic</p>
<p>populist leaders, good and bad, is death anxiety. All right, now, here&rsquo;s where we come in,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re egghead experimental researchers. Becker wrote this book, The Denial of Death, and he</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t get a job. People just dismiss these ideas as fanciful speculation for which there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no evidence. And you&rsquo;ve done some good experiments. Yeah, here&rsquo;s where I can be more cavalier,</p>
<p>and where what I would urge people, like what you said, Lex, is ignore my histrionic and polemic</p>
<p>language, if possible, and step back, if you can, myself included, and let&rsquo;s just consider</p>
<p>the research findings. Because in September 11, 2001, people that are old enough to remember that</p>
<p>horrible day, two days before, George W. Bush had the lowest approval rating in the history of</p>
<p>presidential polling. All right, three weeks later, after he said, we will rid the world of the</p>
<p>evildoers, and then a week or two after that, he said in a cover story on Time magazine that he</p>
<p>believed that God had chosen him to lead the world during this, to lead the country, rather, during</p>
<p>this perilous time, he had the highest approval rating. And so we&rsquo;re like, well, what happened?</p>
<p>You know, what happened to Americans that their approval of President Bush got so high so fast?</p>
<p>Well, our view, following Becker, is that 2001 was like a giant death reminder. The people dying,</p>
<p>plus the symbols of American greatness, World Trade Center and the Pentagon. So we did a bunch</p>
<p>of experiments, and most of our experiments are disarmingly simple. We have one group of</p>
<p>people, and we just remind them that they&rsquo;re going to die. We say, hey, write your thoughts</p>
<p>and feelings about dying. Or in other cases, we stop them outside, either in front of a funeral</p>
<p>home or 100 meters to either side. Our thought being that if we stop you in front of a funeral</p>
<p>home, then death is on your mind, even if you don&rsquo;t know it. And then there&rsquo;s other studies,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re even more subtle, where we bring people into the lab, and they read stuff on a computer,</p>
<p>and while they&rsquo;re doing that, we flash the word death for 28 milliseconds. It&rsquo;s so fast,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t see anything. And then we just measure people&rsquo;s reactions or behavior thereafter. So what</p>
<p>we found in 2003, leading up to the election of 2004, was that Americans did not care for President</p>
<p>Bush or his policies in Iraq in controlled conditions. But if we reminded them of their</p>
<p>mortality first, they liked Bush a lot more. So in every study that we did, Americans liked John</p>
<p>Kerry, who was running against Bush, they liked Kerry more than Bush.</p>
<p>Policy wise, in a controlled&hellip;</p>
<p>In a controlled condition. But if they were reminded of death first, then they liked Bush</p>
<p>a lot more.</p>
<p>So by the way, just a small pause, you said they&rsquo;re discerningly simple experiments.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s, and people should read Warm at the Core for some other description,</p>
<p>you have a lot of different experiments of this nature. I think it&rsquo;s a brilliant experiment</p>
<p>connected to the Stoics, perhaps, of how your worldview on anything and how delicious that</p>
<p>water tastes after you&rsquo;re reminded of your own mortality. It&rsquo;s such a fascinating experiment</p>
<p>that you could probably keep doing like millions of them to draw insight about the way we see the</p>
<p>world.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s right, Lex. And I appreciate the compliment, not because we did anything,</p>
<p>but because what these studies, many of which are now done by other people around the world</p>
<p>in labs that we&rsquo;re not connected with, what I&rsquo;m most proud about our work. I am proud</p>
<p>of the experiments that we&rsquo;ve done. But it&rsquo;s not science until somebody else can replicate</p>
<p>your findings and independent researchers are interested in pursuing them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a fascinating idea. I don&rsquo;t&hellip; I have to think about</p>
<p>a lot about the experiments you&rsquo;ve done and that you&rsquo;ve inspired, about the fact that death</p>
<p>changes the way you see a bunch of different things. I think the Stoics talked about the,</p>
<p>I mean, in general, just memento mori, like just thinking about death and meditating on death is a</p>
<p>really positive, not a positive, it&rsquo;s an enlightening way to live life. So what do you</p>
<p>think about that at the individual level? Like, what is the role about being, bringing that terror</p>
<p>of death, fear of death to the surface and being cognizant of it?</p>
<p>For us, that&rsquo;s the ball game. So what I&rsquo;m trying to say is that</p>
<p>so what we write in our book and here we&rsquo;re just paying homage to the philosophers and</p>
<p>theologians that come before us is to point out that literally since antiquity, there has been</p>
<p>a consensus that to lead a full life requires, Albert Camus said, come to terms with death,</p>
<p>thereafter anything is possible. And so you&rsquo;ve got the Stoics and you&rsquo;ve got the Epicureans and</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ve got the Tibetan Book of the Dead and then you&rsquo;ve got like the medieval monks that,</p>
<p>you know, worked with like a skull on their desk. And the whole idea, I should back up a bit because</p>
<p>and just remind folks that our studies, you know, when we remind people that they&rsquo;re going to die</p>
<p>and we find that, yeah, they drink more water if a famous person is, you know, advertising it,</p>
<p>but they eat more cookies. They want more fancy clothes. They sit closer to people that look like</p>
<p>them. It changes who they vote for. But all of those things, those are very subtle death reminders.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even know that death is on your mind. And so our point is that, and this is kind of</p>
<p>counterintuitive, and that is that the most problematic and unsavory human reactions to death</p>
<p>anxiety are malignant manifestations of repressed death anxiety. You know, we try and bury it under</p>
<p>the psychological bushes and then it comes back to bear bitter fruit. But what the theologians and</p>
<p>the philosophers of the world are saying is it behooves each of us to spend considerable time.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be a goth death rocker, you know, wallowing in death imagery to spend enough</p>
<p>time entertaining the reality of the human condition, which is that you too will pass</p>
<p>to get to the point where there is, to lapse into a cliche, the capacity for personal transformation</p>
<p>and growth. Let&rsquo;s go personal for a second. Are you yourself afraid of death? Yeah.</p>
<p>And how much do you meditate on that thought? Like, maybe your own study of it is a kind of</p>
<p>escape from your own mortality. Absolutely. So you got it. And like, if you figure out death,</p>
<p>somehow you won&rsquo;t die. So no, no. So my my colleagues and good friends, Jeff Greenberg</p>
<p>and Tom Posinski, you know, we met in graduate school in the 1970s. We&rsquo;ve been doing this work</p>
<p>for 40 years. And we cheerfully admit, even though it doesn&rsquo;t reflect well on us as humans,</p>
<p>that I should just speak for myself. But I feel like there&rsquo;s a real sense in which doing these</p>
<p>studies and writing books and lecturing has been my way of avoiding directly confronting my anxiety.</p>
<p>Directly confronting my anxieties by turning it into an intellectual exercise. And every once</p>
<p>in a while, therefore, when I think that I&rsquo;m making some progress as a human, I have to remind</p>
<p>myself that that is probably not the case. And I have at times, like all humans, been more</p>
<p>preoccupied with the implications of these ideas for my self esteem as like, oh, we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>write a book and maybe we&rsquo;ll get to go on TV or something. Well, no, that&rsquo;s not the same as to</p>
<p>actually think about it in a way that you feel it rather than just think it.</p>
<p>Yeah, like you did when you were eight. Exactly right. So when I first read The Denial of Death,</p>
<p>I was so literally flabbergasted by it that I took a leave of absence for a year</p>
<p>and just like did what would be considered menial jobs. I did construction work. I worked in a</p>
<p>restaurant. And I was just like, well, wait a minute. If I understand what this guy is saying,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m just a culturally constructed meat puppet doing things for reasons that I know not</p>
<p>in order to assuage death anxiety. And I was like, that&rsquo;s not acceptable.</p>
<p>Maybe another interesting person to talk about is Ernest Becker himself.</p>
<p>So how did he face his death? Is there something interesting, personal?</p>
<p>I think so. So interesting to me is Becker also from a Jewish family, claimed to be</p>
<p>the atheistic, did not identify ultimately as Jewish. I believe he converted to Christianity,</p>
<p>but was himself a religious person. And he said he became religious when his first child was born.</p>
<p>Now religious, what does that mean? Does he have a faith? Well, let&rsquo;s talk more. Most importantly,</p>
<p>is the afterlife. What&rsquo;s his view on the afterlife? He was agnostic on that, but he did.</p>
<p>Now the denial of death is, there&rsquo;s a chapter devoted to Kierkegaard. And he talks about</p>
<p>for Kierkegaard, if you want to become a mature individual, if you want to learn something,</p>
<p>you go to the university. If you want to become a more mature individual, according to Kierkegaard,</p>
<p>you got to go to the school of anxiety. And what Kierkegaard said is that we have to let this vague</p>
<p>dis ease, put a hyphen between dis and ease about death. Kierkegaard&rsquo;s point is you have to really</p>
<p>think about that. You have to think about it and feel it. You got to let it seek in or seep into</p>
<p>your mind. At which point, according to Kierkegaard, basically you realize that your</p>
<p>present identity is fundamentally a cultural construction. You didn&rsquo;t choose the time and</p>
<p>place of your birth. You didn&rsquo;t choose your name. You didn&rsquo;t choose necessarily even the social</p>
<p>role that you occupy. You might&rsquo;ve chosen from what&rsquo;s available in your culture, but not from</p>
<p>the full palette of human opportunities. And so what Kierkegaard said is that we need to realize</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been living a lie of sorts. Becker calls it a necessary lie. And we have to momentarily</p>
<p>dispose of that. And so now Kierkegaard says, well, here I am. I have shrugged off all of the</p>
<p>all of the cultural accoutrements that I have used to define myself. And now what am I or who am I?</p>
<p>This is like the ancient Greek tragedy where the worst thing was to be no one or no thing. At this</p>
<p>point, Kierkegaard said, you&rsquo;re really dangling on the precipice of oblivion. And some people</p>
<p>tumble into that abyss and never come out. On the other hand, Kierkegaard said that</p>
<p>what you can now do metaphorically and literally is to rebuild yourself from the ground up. And</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a, in the new Testament, there&rsquo;s something you have to die in order to be reborn. And</p>
<p>Kierkegaard&rsquo;s view though, is that there&rsquo;s only one way to do that. This is his proverbial leap</p>
<p>into faith. And in Kierkegaard&rsquo;s case, it was faith in Christianity, that you can&rsquo;t have unbridled</p>
<p>faith in cultural constructions. The only thing that you can have unequivocal faith in is some</p>
<p>kind of transcendent power. All right. But of course, this raises the question of, well, is that</p>
<p>just another death denying belief system? And at the end of the denial of death, Becker admits</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no way to tell while still advocating for what is ultimately a religious stance. Now,</p>
<p>one of the things that I don&rsquo;t understand, and Becker has been the most singularly potent</p>
<p>influence in my academic and personal life, but a year or two ago, I started reading Martin</p>
<p>Heidegger. I&rsquo;m reading Being and Time. And what I now wonder is why Becker, who refers to Heidegger</p>
<p>from time to time in his work, why he didn&rsquo;t take Heidegger more seriously. Because Heidegger</p>
<p>is like a secular Kierkegaard. He has the same thing, which is death anxiety. Oh, and I should</p>
<p>have pointed out that what Kierkegaard says is that death anxiety, most people don&rsquo;t go to the</p>
<p>school of anxiety. They flee from death anxiety by embracing their cultural beliefs. Kierkegaard</p>
<p>says they then tranquilize themselves with the trivial. And I love that phrase. It&rsquo;s a beautiful</p>
<p>phrase because at the end of the denial of death, Becker&rsquo;s like, look, the average American is</p>
<p>either drinking or shopping or watching television, and they&rsquo;re all the same thing, right? Heidegger</p>
<p>says the same thing. He says, look, and he acknowledges Kierkegaard. He says, what makes us</p>
<p>feel unsettled? And evidently, that&rsquo;s an English translation of angst, that we don&rsquo;t feel at home</p>
<p>in the world. Heidegger says that&rsquo;s death anxiety. And one direction is the Kierkegaard one.</p>
<p>Heidegger calls it a flight from death. You just unself reflexively cling to your cultural</p>
<p>constructions. And Heidegger borrows the term tranquilized, but he points out that he doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>care for that term because tranquilized sounds like you&rsquo;re subdued. When in fact, what most</p>
<p>culturally constructed meat puppets do is to be frenetically engaged with their surroundings to</p>
<p>ensure that they never sit still long enough to actually think about anything consequential.</p>
<p>Heidegger says there&rsquo;s another way, though. He&rsquo;s like, yo, what you can do is to come to terms with</p>
<p>that death anxiety in the following way. Thing number one is to realize that not only are you</p>
<p>going to die, but your death can happen at any given moment. So for Heidegger, if you say, I know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to die in some vaguely unspecified future moment, that&rsquo;s still death denial because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying, yeah, not me, not now. Heidegger&rsquo;s point is you need to get to the point where you need to</p>
<p>realize that I need to realize that I can walk outside and get smote by a comet, or I can stop</p>
<p>for gas on the way home and catch the virus and be dead in two days, or any number of potentially</p>
<p>unanticipated and uncontrollable fatal outcomes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brilliant, by the way. Sorry. To bring it to the now.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is brilliant. I agree, Lex, and that&rsquo;s just why I&rsquo;m wondering why didn&rsquo;t Becker notice</p>
<p>this? Because that&rsquo;s the being and time thing, is it&rsquo;s got to be now. And then he says, so okay,</p>
<p>so now I&rsquo;ve dealt somewhat with the death part. And now he says, now you&rsquo;ve got to deal with what he</p>
<p>calls existential guilt. And he says, well, all right, you have to realize that like it or not,</p>
<p>you have to make choices. This is Jean Paul Sartre, we are condemned by virtue of consciousness to</p>
<p>choosing. But Heidegger is a little bit more precise. He&rsquo;s like, look, as I was saying earlier,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in reality, you&rsquo;re an insignificant speck of respiring carbon based dust born into a time</p>
<p>and place not of your choosing when you&rsquo;re here for a microscopic amount of time after which you</p>
<p>are not. And for Heidegger, you have to realize that, like I said, I didn&rsquo;t choose to be born a</p>
<p>male or Jewish or in America, the offspring of working class people. And Heidegger, what he says</p>
<p>is, yeah, but you still have to make choices and accept responsibility for those choices,</p>
<p>even though you didn&rsquo;t choose any of the parameters that ultimately limit what&rsquo;s available</p>
<p>to you. And moreover, you&rsquo;re going to not always make good choices. So now you&rsquo;re guilty for your</p>
<p>choices. And then he uses the poet Rilke, he has a phrase, Becker uses it in The Denial of Death,</p>
<p>the guilt of unlived life. I just love that. You have to accept that you have already diminished</p>
<p>and in many ways amputated your own possibilities by virtue of choices that you&rsquo;ve made or just as</p>
<p>often have declined to make because you are reluctant to accept responsibility for the</p>
<p>opportunities that you are now able to create by virtue of seeing the possibilities that lay before</p>
<p>you. So anyway, Heidegger then says, look, OK, so, you know, I&rsquo;m a professor and I live in America</p>
<p>in the 21st century. Well, if I was in the third century living in a year in Mongolia, I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to have an opportunity to be a professor. But what he submits is that there is some aspects</p>
<p>of whatever I am that are independent of my cultural and historical circumstances. In other</p>
<p>words, there is a me of sorts. Heidegger would take vigorous issue and so would Heidegger&rsquo;s</p>
<p>scholars because I&rsquo;m not claiming to understand him. This is my classic comic book rendering.</p>
<p>But Heidegger&rsquo;s point is that you get to the point where you&rsquo;re able to say, OK,</p>
<p>I am a contingent historical and cultural artifact. But so what? You know, if I was,</p>
<p>you know, if I was transported a thousand years in the past in Asia, I&rsquo;d be in the same situation.</p>
<p>I would still be conditioned by time and place. I would still have choices that I could make</p>
<p>within the confines of what opportunities are afforded to me. And then Heidegger says,</p>
<p>if I can get that far in this is his language. He says that there is a transformation and he</p>
<p>literally he calls it a turning. You&rsquo;re turning away from a flight from death and you are allowed</p>
<p>you therefore you see a horizon is his word of opportunity that makes you in a state of</p>
<p>anticipatory resoluteness with solicitous regard for others that makes your life seem like an</p>
<p>adventure perfused with unshakable joy. Let me unpack those things. It is beautiful. It is. I</p>
<p>love, Lex, that you&rsquo;re resonating to the time thing. So he&rsquo;s like, OK, we already talked about</p>
<p>now. Anticipatory is is already hopeful because it&rsquo;s looking forward to be resolute. It means to</p>
<p>trust and to just have confidence in what you&rsquo;re doing moving forward. All right. Solicitous. I</p>
<p>had to look up all these words, by the way. It just means that you are concerned about your</p>
<p>fellow human beings. And but I love the idea, even if it seems allegorical, I don&rsquo;t mind that</p>
<p>at all. This idea you said love earlier. And I think that when Heidegger is talking about being</p>
<p>solicitous, that&rsquo;s as close as he can get. There&rsquo;s an Italian. Yes. So what was that line again with</p>
<p>the solicitous of the whole thing of turning away from death? And all the words you said are just</p>
<p>beautiful. I love those words. Yeah. Anticipatory resoluteness that is accompanied with solicitous</p>
<p>regard to our fellow humans, which makes life appear to us to be an ongoing adventure that is</p>
<p>permeated by unshakable joy. Now, again, Heidegger is not Mary Poppins. This I just got a tattoo.</p>
<p>I know. This is great. I just love that exact quote. No, I&rsquo;m piecing together. These are his</p>
<p>exact words that and I spent the last two years reading almost everything that I can find because</p>
<p>I want to. I&rsquo;m sick of death. You said it. So I want to second what you say, Lex. So it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>about death. It&rsquo;s the Sherwood Anderson guy. He&rsquo;s a novelist that I like about. He wrote a book</p>
<p>in Lyonsburg, Ohio. And now I&rsquo;m going to forget what he said on his tombstone. But, you know, it</p>
<p>was something to the effect. Oh, he said life, not death is the great adventure. The point being is</p>
<p>that, you know, to consider that we must die and the existential implications of that, really,</p>
<p>the goal, the way I see it is getting from hate to love. And I feel like Heidegger has</p>
<p>a way of thinking about things that moves us more in that direction. And so that&rsquo;s kind of my</p>
<p>current preoccupation is to take what I just said to you and to talk about it with my colleagues</p>
<p>and other academic psychologists, because the way we started with Ernest Becker,</p>
<p>remember I said earlier, I wasn&rsquo;t trained in any of these things. I&rsquo;m an egghead</p>
<p>researcher that was doing experiments about biofeedback. And, you know, then we read these</p>
<p>Becker books, and I thought they were so interesting that for the first few years,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t have any studies. I just would travel around and I&rsquo;d be like, here&rsquo;s what this Becker</p>
<p>guy says. I think this is cool. Well, my present view is I&rsquo;m like, here&rsquo;s what this Heidegger guy</p>
<p>says. I think these ideas are consistent with what Becker is saying because they are anchored in</p>
<p>death anxiety. But I like that direction as an alternative to the Kierkegaardian insistence that</p>
<p>the only psychologically tenable way to extricate ourselves from maladaptive reactions to death</p>
<p>anxiety is through faith in the traditional sense. Yeah, I always kind of saw Kierkegaard unfairly,</p>
<p>like you said, in a comic book sense of the word faith as a non traditional sense. I kind of like</p>
<p>the idea of leap of faith. Oh, I love that idea. And so what I&rsquo;ve been babbling about with, you</p>
<p>know, Heidegger, I&rsquo;m like, yeah, Kierkegaard is a leap of faith in God. Heidegger is a leap of faith</p>
<p>in life. And I just like it. I found the leap of faith really interesting in the technological</p>
<p>space. So I&rsquo;ve talked to on this thing with Elon Musk, but I think he&rsquo;s also just in general for</p>
<p>our culture, a really important figure. Oh, absolutely. That takes, I mean, sometimes a</p>
<p>little bit insane on social media and just in life. When I met him, it was kind of interesting</p>
<p>that, of course, there&rsquo;s, I mean, he&rsquo;s a legit engineer, so he&rsquo;s fun to talk to about the</p>
<p>technical things, but he also just the way the humor and the way he sees life, it just like</p>
<p>refuses to be conventional. So it&rsquo;s a constant leap into the unknown. And one of the things</p>
<p>that he does, and this isn&rsquo;t even like fake. A lot of people say, cause he&rsquo;s a CEO,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a business owner. So he&rsquo;s trying to make money. No, I think I looked him in his eyes. I</p>
<p>mean, this is real, is a lot of the things he believes that are going to be accomplished that</p>
<p>a lot of others are saying are impossible, like autonomous vehicles. He truly believes it. To me,</p>
<p>that is the leap of faith of I&rsquo;m almost going like, we&rsquo;re like the entirety of our experience</p>
<p>is shrouded in mystery. We don&rsquo;t know what the hell&rsquo;s going to happen. We don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually capable of as human beings. And he just takes the leap. He fully believes that we can,</p>
<p>you know, we can go to, we can colonize Mars. I mean, how, how crazy is it to just believe and</p>
<p>dream and actually be taking steps towards it to colonizing Mars when most people are like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the stupidest idea ever. Yeah. Well, I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m in agreement with you on that. You know,</p>
<p>two things, you know, one is it reminds me of Ben Franklin who in his autobiography,</p>
<p>you know, has a similarly childish in the best sense of the word, unbridled imagination for what</p>
<p>might become, you know, Ben Franklin&rsquo;s like, yeah, I got electricity. That&rsquo;s cool, but we&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>levitating soon. And I, we can&rsquo;t even begin to imagine what we are capable of. And of course,</p>
<p>people are like, dude, that&rsquo;s crazy. And there&rsquo;s a guy with it&rsquo;s FCS Schiller, some humanistic guy</p>
<p>at the beginning of the 20th century. He&rsquo;s like, you know, lots of things that people think about</p>
<p>may appear to be absurd to the point of obscene. But the reality is historically</p>
<p>every fantastic innovation has generally been initiated by someone who was condemned</p>
<p>for being a lunatic. And it&rsquo;s not that anything is possible, but surely things that we don&rsquo;t try</p>
<p>will never manifest as possibilities. Yeah. And that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s that there&rsquo;s something beautiful</p>
<p>to that. That&rsquo;s the embracing the abyss. And again, it&rsquo;s like the, it&rsquo;s the embracing the</p>
<p>fear of death, the reality of death and then turning and to look at all the opportunities.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. Let me ask you, whenever I bring up Ernest Becker&rsquo;s work, which I do and yours</p>
<p>is quite a bit, I find it surprising how that it&rsquo;s not a lot more popular in a sense that,</p>
<p>no, we&rsquo;re not, I don&rsquo;t mean just your book. That&rsquo;s well written. People should read it,</p>
<p>should buy it, whatever. I think it has the same kind of qualities that are useful to think about</p>
<p>as like Jordan Peterson&rsquo;s work and stuff like that. But I just mean like why people are not,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think of that as a compelling description of the core of the human condition. Like,</p>
<p>I think what you mentioned about Heidegger is quite, connects with me quite well. So I ask</p>
<p>on this podcast, I often ask people if they&rsquo;re afraid of death. That&rsquo;s like almost every single</p>
<p>part. I almost always get criticized for asking world class people, scientists and technologists</p>
<p>about fear of death and the meaning of life. And on the fear of death, they often</p>
<p>like don&rsquo;t say anything interesting. What I mean by that is they haven&rsquo;t thought deeply about it.</p>
<p>Like you kind of brought this up a few times of really letting it sink in. They kind of say this</p>
<p>thing about what exactly you said, which is like, it&rsquo;s something that happens not today. Like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>aware that it&rsquo;s something that happens. And I&rsquo;m not, the thing they usually say is I&rsquo;m not afraid</p>
<p>of death. I just want to live a good life kind of thing. And what I&rsquo;m trying to express is like when</p>
<p>I look in their eyes and the kind of the core of the conversation, it looks like they haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really become, like they haven&rsquo;t really meditated on death. I guess the question is, what do I say</p>
<p>to people that there&rsquo;s something to really think about here? Like there&rsquo;s some demons, some realities</p>
<p>that need to be faced by more people. Well, that&rsquo;s a tough one. You know, I could tell you what not to</p>
<p>do. So when we are young and annoying, a lot of famous people, mostly psychologists because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>who we intersected with, we would lay out these ideas and they would be, well, I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>about death like that. So these ideas must be wrong. And we would say, well, you don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>about death because you&rsquo;re lucky enough to be comfortably ensconced in a cultural worldview</p>
<p>from which you derive self esteem. And that has spared you the existential excruciations that</p>
<p>would otherwise arise. But that&rsquo;s like Freud. You know, you&rsquo;re repressing, so you either agree with</p>
<p>me in which case I&rsquo;m right, or you disagree with me in which case you&rsquo;re repressing and I&rsquo;m right.</p>
<p>Well, so that&rsquo;s the Nietzsche thing. What I felt when I&rsquo;ve, there&rsquo;ve been moments in my life</p>
<p>when I really thought about death. I mean, there&rsquo;s not too many. Like really, really thought about it</p>
<p>and feel the thing when you felt that eight, maybe I&rsquo;m traumatizing or romanticizing it. But</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s, the conservatives call it popularly like, or the movie Matrix call it the</p>
<p>red pill moment. I feel like it&rsquo;s a dangerous thought because I feel like I&rsquo;m taking a step</p>
<p>out of a society. Like there&rsquo;s a nice narrative that we&rsquo;ve all constructed and I&rsquo;m taking a step</p>
<p>out. And it feels, there&rsquo;s this feeling like you&rsquo;re basically drowning. I mean, it&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>good feeling. It is not. But this gets back to the Heidegger Kierkegaard school of anxiety. You are</p>
<p>stepping out and you are momentarily shrugging off, again, the culturally constructed psychological</p>
<p>accoutrements that allow you to stand up in the morning. And so, I mean, in that sense, it feels</p>
<p>like, I mean, how do you have that conversation? Because I guess I&rsquo;m dancing around a set of</p>
<p>questions, which is like, I guess I&rsquo;m disappointed that people don&rsquo;t, are not as willing to step</p>
<p>outside. Like even just, even any kind of thought experiment. Forget denial of death. Like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not a community of people. Let&rsquo;s take an easy one that I think is scientifically</p>
<p>ridiculous, which is, there&rsquo;s a community of people that believe that the earth is flat. Or</p>
<p>actually even better, the space is fake. Like what I find surprising is that a lot of people I talk</p>
<p>to are not willing to be like, imagine if it is, like imagine the earth is flat. Like think about</p>
<p>it. Like a lot of people are just like, no, the earth is round. They&rsquo;re like scientists too. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like, yeah, well actually, wait, have you actually like thought about it? Like imagine like a thought</p>
<p>experiment that like basically step outside the little narrative that we are comfortable with. Now</p>
<p>that one in particular is, has really strong evidence and scientific validation. So it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty simple thing to show that it at least is not flat. But just the willingness to take a step</p>
<p>outside of the stories that bring us comfort, it&rsquo;s been disappointing that people are not willing to</p>
<p>do that. And I think the philosophy that you&rsquo;ve constructed and that Ernest Becker is constructing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve tested, I think is really compelling. And the fact that people aren&rsquo;t often willing to take</p>
<p>that step. It&rsquo;s disappointing. Well, yes, but perhaps understandable. I mean, one of this is</p>
<p>an anecdote, of course, but when we were trying to get a publisher for our book, we had a meeting</p>
<p>with a publisher who published some Malcolm Gladwell books. And she said, I&rsquo;m very interested</p>
<p>in your book, but can you write it without mentioning death? Because people don&rsquo;t like death.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re like, no, it&rsquo;s really kind of central. And I think that&rsquo;s part of it. I think, again,</p>
<p>if these ideas have merit, and I actually like the way that you put it, Lex, it&rsquo;s that to step away</p>
<p>is to momentarily expose yourself to all of the anxiety that our identity and our beliefs</p>
<p>typically enable us to manage. I think it&rsquo;s as simple as that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I had this experience in college with my best friend who got really high. And he forgot,</p>
<p>it was in the winter, it was really freezing. It was memorable to me. I think it&rsquo;s an analogy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very useful. So he went to get some pizza. And he left me outside and said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be back in five minutes. And he forgot that he left me outside. And I remember it was,</p>
<p>I was in shorts, it was freezing winter. And I remember standing outside, it&rsquo;s a dorm,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m looking from the outside in, it&rsquo;s a light and it&rsquo;s warm. And I&rsquo;m just standing there frozen,</p>
<p>I think for an hour or more. And that&rsquo;s how I think about it. I don&rsquo;t give a damn about the</p>
<p>stupid winter. I&rsquo;m drawn to be back to the warm. And that&rsquo;s how I feel about thinking about death.</p>
<p>At a certain point, it&rsquo;s too much. It&rsquo;s like that cold. I wanna be back into the warm.</p>
<p>Getting back to Heidegger for a moment. He uses a lot the idea of feeling at home,</p>
<p>not as like in your house, but just feeling like you&rsquo;re comfortably situated.</p>
<p>Maybe you could talk about, like I had a conversation about this with my dad a little bit.</p>
<p>How does religion relate to this?</p>
<p>I see it as the disease and the cure. In a sense, a few things. One is that I think a case could be</p>
<p>made that humans are innately religious. So now we&rsquo;re gonna get into territory where there&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>be a lot of disputes. And what do you mean by religious?</p>
<p>Religion is an evolutionary adaptation.</p>
<p>And religion is like a belief in something outside of yourself kind of thing?</p>
<p>Not necessarily. So here we gotta be a little bit more careful. And again, I&rsquo;m not a scholar.</p>
<p>How about I&rsquo;m a well intentioned dilettante in this regard? Because what I have read is that</p>
<p>religion evolved very early on, long before our ancestors were conscious and the issue of death</p>
<p>arose. And the word religion evidently is from a Latin word, regatear. We can look it up. And it</p>
<p>means to bind. And Emile Durkheim, the dead French sociologist, he said, you know, originally</p>
<p>religion is Darce Lassing, who&rsquo;s a dead novelist. She calls it the substance of we feeling that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>literally that it arose because we&rsquo;re uber social creatures who from time to time took comfort in</p>
<p>just being in physical proximity with our fellow humans. And that there is this kind of sense of</p>
<p>transcendent exuberance, just back to the unshakable joy that Heidegger alludes to.</p>
<p>And that the original function of religion was to foster social cohesion and coordination. And that</p>
<p>it was only subsequently some claim that a burgeoning level of consciousness made it such that</p>
<p>religious belief systems that included the hope of some kind of</p>
<p>immortality were just naturally selected thereafter. So there are some people. So</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s David Sloan Wilson wrote a book called Darwin&rsquo;s Cathedral. And he said,</p>
<p>religion has nothing to do with death. It&rsquo;s evolved to make groups viable. He&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>a group selection guy. What&rsquo;s group selection? The idea that it&rsquo;s the group that is selected</p>
<p>for rather than the individual. Yeah, so people have vigorous disagreements about that. But I</p>
<p>guess our point would be, we see religion as being inextricably connected, ultimately, to assuaging</p>
<p>concerns about death. Well, I guess another question to ask around this, like, what does</p>
<p>the world look like without religion? Will we, if it&rsquo;s inextricably connected to our fears of death,</p>
<p>do you think it always returns in some kind of shape? Maybe it&rsquo;s not called religion, but whatever,</p>
<p>it just keeps returning? Yeah, who knows? So that&rsquo;s a great question, Lex. So there&rsquo;s a woman named</p>
<p>Karen Armstrong. She was a nun turned historian. And she&rsquo;s, I can&rsquo;t remember the name of the book,</p>
<p>but no matter. She, we could look that up, but&hellip; If you want, I can look it up, but I can also,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just add it in post. Yeah, her point, it says God in the title, of course.</p>
<p>But she&rsquo;s like, look, all religions are generally fairly right minded in that they advocate the</p>
<p>golden rule. And all religions, at their best, do seem to foster pro social behavior towards the</p>
<p>in group. And that confers both psychological as well as physical benefits. That&rsquo;s the good news.</p>
<p>And the bad news is historically all religions are subject to being hijacked by a lunatic fringe</p>
<p>who declares that, you know, they&rsquo;re the ones in sole possession of the world.</p>
<p>Sole possession of the liturgical practices or whatever they call them.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re the ones that turn, you know, religion at its best into your crusades and holocausts.</p>
<p>Yeah. My view, not that it should matter for much, but I grew up just skeptical of religion</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m like, as a kid, I&rsquo;m like, well, if we didn&rsquo;t have these beliefs,</p>
<p>we wouldn&rsquo;t be killing each other because of them. And I&rsquo;d be like to my parents,</p>
<p>well, you&rsquo;re telling me that all people should be judged on the merits of their character,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t come home if you don&rsquo;t marry a Jewish woman. Right. Which is implying that if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not Jewish, you&rsquo;re an inferior form of life. Yeah. That&rsquo;s what tribes always do.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s the tribal thing. And so there&rsquo;s a guy named Amin Malouf, a Lebanese guy who writes</p>
<p>in French in the 1990s, I think wrote a book called In the Name of Identity, Violence and</p>
<p>the Need to Belong. And that was his point is unless we can overcome this tribal mentality,</p>
<p>this will not end well. But you said earlier something, Lex, that I think is profound and</p>
<p>profoundly important. And that is you did not recoil in horror when I mentioned Kierkegaard&rsquo;s</p>
<p>use of the term faith. And so I&rsquo;m a big fan of faith and I&rsquo;m not sure what that implies.</p>
<p>And by the way, this is just a peripheral comment, but I find less resistance to Becker&rsquo;s ideas in</p>
<p>our work when I&rsquo;m in Jesuit schools. It&rsquo;s the Americans, the secular humanists who</p>
<p>are most disinclined to accept these ideas. It&rsquo;s an important side comment because I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mostly because they don&rsquo;t think philosophically. I speak with a lot of scientists and I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>my main criticism. I mean, that&rsquo;s the problem with science is it&rsquo;s so comforting to focus in</p>
<p>on the details that you can escape thinking about the mystery of it all, the big picture things,</p>
<p>the philosophical, like the fact that you don&rsquo;t actually know shit at all. So in terms of Jesuit,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s the beauty of the experience of faith and so on is like, wherever that journey takes you</p>
<p>is you actually explore the biggest questions of our world. So I don&rsquo;t see religion going away</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t see humans as capable of surviving without faith and hope. And</p>
<p>then everyone from the Pope to Elon Musk will acknowledge that it is a world that is unfathomably</p>
<p>mysterious. And like it or not, in the absence of beliefs, here I&rsquo;m Charles Peirce, the pragmatic</p>
<p>philosopher, he just said beliefs are the basis of action. If you don&rsquo;t have any beliefs, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>paralyzed with indecision, whether we&rsquo;re aware of it or not, whether we like it or not, in order to</p>
<p>stand up in the morning, you have to subscribe to beliefs that can never be unequivocally proven</p>
<p>right or wrong. Well, then why do you maintain them? Well, ultimately it&rsquo;s because of some form</p>
<p>of faith. But also faith shouldn&rsquo;t be a dogmatic thing that you should always be leaping.</p>
<p>I guess the problem with science or with religion is you can sort of all of a sudden</p>
<p>take a step into a place where you&rsquo;re super confident that you know the absolute truth of</p>
<p>things. There you go. And again, back to Socrates, Plato, back in the cave. At Skidmore, where I</p>
<p>work, that&rsquo;s what I have the students read in their first week. And Plato&rsquo;s like, oh, look at</p>
<p>all those poor bastards. They&rsquo;re in the cave, but they don&rsquo;t know it. And then they are freed from</p>
<p>their chains. And they have to be dragged out of the cave, by the way, which is another interesting</p>
<p>point. They don&rsquo;t run out. But that gets back to why people don&rsquo;t like to be divested of their</p>
<p>comfortable illusions. But anyway, they get dragged out of the cave into the sunlight,</p>
<p>which he claims is a representation of truth and beauty. And I say to the students, well,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s wrong with that? And they&rsquo;re like, nothing. That&rsquo;s like awesome. And then I&rsquo;m like, yo, dudes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re out of the cave, but how do you know that you&rsquo;re not in another cave? The illumination may</p>
<p>be better. But the minute you think you&rsquo;re at the end of the proverbial intellectual slash</p>
<p>epistemological trail, then you have already succumbed to either laziness or dogmatism or</p>
<p>both. That&rsquo;s really well put. That&rsquo;s both terrifying and exciting that there&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>a bigger cave. A little bit of an out there question, but I think some of the interesting</p>
<p>qualities of the human mind is the ideas of intelligence and consciousness. So what do you</p>
<p>make of consciousness? So do you think death creates consciousness, like the fear of death,</p>
<p>the terror of death creates consciousness and consciousness in turn magnifies the terror of</p>
<p>death? I do. Like what is consciousness to you? Don&rsquo;t ask me that. So now if I could answer that,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;d be chugging rum out of a coconut with my Nobel prize that, you know, it&rsquo;s literally,</p>
<p>you know, Steven Pinker, I do agree with his claim and I think how the mind works, that it is the</p>
<p>key question for the psychological sciences broadly defined in the 21st century.</p>
<p>What is consciousness?</p>
<p>Yeah, what is consciousness? And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s an epiphenomenological afterthought. So a</p>
<p>lot of people, I think Dan Wagner at Harvard, a lot of folks consider it just the ass end of a</p>
<p>process that by the time we are aware of what it is, it&rsquo;s just basically an integrated rendering</p>
<p>of something that&rsquo;s already happened. You know, evidently there&rsquo;s a half second delay between</p>
<p>when something happens, you know, those studies and our awareness of it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where like ideas of free will will step in. You can explain away a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>And I think those are all important and interesting questions. I&rsquo;m of the persuasion.</p>
<p>I mean, even, not even, but Dawkins and the selfish gene is very thoughtful. Actually,</p>
<p>in a lot of, it&rsquo;s actually more in notes than in the text of the book, but he&rsquo;s just like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard for me to imagine that consciousness doesn&rsquo;t have some sort of important and highly</p>
<p>adaptive function. And what Dawkins says is he thought about it in terms of just that we could</p>
<p>do mental simulations, that one possibly extraordinary product of consciousness is to</p>
<p>rather than find out often by adverse consequences through trying something would be to run mental</p>
<p>simulations. And so one possibility is that consciousness is highly adaptive.</p>
<p>Another possibility is Nicholas Humphrey, a British dude who wrote a book about, I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called Regaining Consciousness. And he hypothesized, I think this is 1980s, maybe even earlier,</p>
<p>that consciousness arose as a way to better predict the behavior of others in social settings,</p>
<p>that by knowing how I feel makes me better able to know how you may be feeling. This is like the</p>
<p>rudiments of a theory of mind. And it really may not have had anything to do with intelligence,</p>
<p>so much as social intelligence.</p>
<p>So in that sense, consciousness is a social construct. It&rsquo;s just a useful thing for interacting</p>
<p>with other humans. I don&rsquo;t know, but there seems to be something about realizing your own mortality</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s somehow intricately connected to the idea of consciousness.</p>
<p>Well, I think so also. So this is where, and Nietzsche, he said a solitary creature would not</p>
<p>need consciousness.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know what I think about that. And then he goes on to say that consciousness</p>
<p>is the most calamitous stupidity by which we shall someday perish. And wow, I was like, dude.</p>
<p>Relax.</p>
<p>Say you were on an island alone, and you saw a reflection of yourself in the water.</p>
<p>If you were alone your whole life.</p>
<p>Yeah, great question. Nietzsche&rsquo;s view would be that your thoughts of yourself would never</p>
<p>come to mind. I don&rsquo;t know how I feel about that, though.</p>
<p>In a sense, this sounds weird, but in a sense, I feel like my mental conversation has always</p>
<p>been with death. It&rsquo;s almost like another notion, like these visualizations of a death</p>
<p>in the cloak. I always felt like I am a living thing, and then there&rsquo;s an other thing that</p>
<p>is the end of me. And I&rsquo;m having a conversation with that. So in a sense, that&rsquo;s the way I</p>
<p>construct the fact that I am a thing is because there&rsquo;s somebody else that tells me, well,</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t be a thing eventually. So this feels like a conversation, perhaps, but that might</p>
<p>be kind of this mental stimulation kind of idea. It&rsquo;s a conversation with yourself, essentially.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know how I feel about that, but I tend to be in agreement with you when</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about economics more so that we&rsquo;re deeply social beings. It just feels</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re humans. I&rsquo;m with Harari with the sapiens. We seem to construct ideas on top</p>
<p>of each other, and that&rsquo;s fundamentally a social process.</p>
<p>Absolutely. I think that&rsquo;s a fine book. It overlaps considerably with our take on these</p>
<p>matters, and the fact that we get to these points, drawing on different sources, I think</p>
<p>makes me more confident.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so fascinating, just like reading your book, sorry, on a small tangent, that Sapiens</p>
<p>is one of the most popular books in the world. And just reading your book is like, well,</p>
<p>this sounds&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know what makes a popular book.</p>
<p>Well, if you want me to be petty and stupid, I will tell you that from time to time, we</p>
<p>also wonder why our book&hellip; Like all books, people can take issue with it, but we thought</p>
<p>it would be a bigger hit, that it would be more widely read.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny because I&rsquo;ve&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know if I have good examples because I forgot already,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m often saddened by Franz Kafka. I think he wasn&rsquo;t known in his life, but I</p>
<p>always wonder these great&hellip; Some of the greatest books ever written are completely unknown</p>
<p>during the author&rsquo;s lifetime. And it&rsquo;s like, man, for some reason, it&rsquo;s again, it&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>identity thing. I think, man, that sucks.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m comforted by that. So Van Gogh sold one painting in his life, and evidently Thoreau</p>
<p>sold like 75 copies of Walden. Nietzsche&rsquo;s books did not sell well.</p>
<p>And how did Ernest Becker sell? His books are published by the free press</p>
<p>and have sold more than any other books that they have published.</p>
<p>So what does that mean? It&rsquo;s a lot? I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s like Jordan Peterson</p>
<p>Millions, but it&rsquo;s hundreds of thousands. Was he respected? I just don&rsquo;t see him&hellip;</p>
<p>Okay. I don&rsquo;t see him brought up as like in the top 10 philosophers of&hellip;</p>
<p>No, not at all. So how far away is he? Is he in the top 100</p>
<p>for people? I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not brought up that often. Because again&hellip;</p>
<p>Like your work is brought up more often. Yeah.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s one of the great philosophers of the 20th century.</p>
<p>So what we say, Lex, is that our goal, certainly when we first started and now</p>
<p>just as much actually, but what I say at all my talks is, look, if these ideas have</p>
<p>interest you enough to go read Ernest Becker, then this has been good. I consider him to be</p>
<p>one of the most important voices of the 20th century who does not get the attention that</p>
<p>he deserves. Similarly, our work I believe to be important because point by point we provide</p>
<p>empirical corroboration for all of the claims. So that&rsquo;s literally the students that read</p>
<p>The Denial of Death and then Escape from Evil. They&rsquo;re like, yeah, wow, every chapter of the</p>
<p>book, you have studies. And I&rsquo;m like, yeah, because for 40 years, if a Skidmore student said,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s gotta be bullshit. I&rsquo;m like, well, let&rsquo;s do a study.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do a study. And my own dreams are in creating</p>
<p>robots and artificial intelligence systems that a human can love. And I think there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about mortality and fear mortality that is essential for implementing in our AI systems.</p>
<p>And so maybe can you comment on that? So this is a different perspective on your work,</p>
<p>which is like, how do we engineer a human?</p>
<p>Yeah, so, no, this is awesome, Lex. I&rsquo;m delighted that you said that. First of all,</p>
<p>and I may have mentioned this to you, and I can&rsquo;t remember because I am seeing now, when you first</p>
<p>contacted me, I had just been told I have to learn more about your work because I&rsquo;m working with some</p>
<p>very talented people in New York and they&rsquo;re writing a screenplay for a movie about an artificial</p>
<p>intelligence. It&rsquo;s a female AI set in like 30 years in the future. And basically the little</p>
<p>twist, this is how I had to read Heidegger. So these people call me and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re making a movie. It&rsquo;s based on Becker and your work and Heidegger and this other</p>
<p>philosopher, Levinas, and then another philosopher, Silvia Benzo, who&rsquo;s an Italian philosopher.</p>
<p>And the long short story is the movie is about supposedly the most advanced artificial</p>
<p>intelligence entity, an embodied one, and who‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Human form?</p>
<p>Human form, who finds out, who is having essentially existential anxieties. And I think</p>
<p>the project is called A Dinner with Her or something, and it doesn&rsquo;t really matter, but the</p>
<p>punchline is that she finds out that her creator has made her mortal. And so the question is what</p>
<p>happens phenomenologically and behaviorally to an artificial intelligence who now knows that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mortal? And it&rsquo;s actually the same question that you&rsquo;re posing. And that is, is that necessary</p>
<p>in order for an AI to approximate humanity?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think, yeah. So the intuition, again, it&rsquo;s unknown, but I think it&rsquo;s absolutely,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s absolutely necessary. A lot of people, the same kind of shallow thinking that people</p>
<p>have about our own end of life, our own death, is the same way people think of, I think, about</p>
<p>artificial intelligence. It&rsquo;s like, well, okay, so yeah, so within the system, there&rsquo;s a terminal</p>
<p>position where there&rsquo;s a point at which it ends, the program ends, there&rsquo;s a goal state, there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>you reached an end point. But the thing is, making that end a thing that&rsquo;s also within the program,</p>
<p>like making the thing, and then it&rsquo;s also the mystery of it. So the thing is, we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what the hell this death thing is. I mean, it&rsquo;s not like we, I mean, the program doesn&rsquo;t give</p>
<p>us information about the meaning of it all. And that&rsquo;s where the terror is. And it feels like,</p>
<p>I mean, in the language that you would think about is the terror of this death, or like</p>
<p>anticipation of it, or thinking about it, is the creative force that builds everything.</p>
<p>Right. And that feels like, you know, that feels really important to implement. Again,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult to know how to do technically, currently, but it&rsquo;s important to think about.</p>
<p>What I find is, you mentioned like screenplays and so on, is sci fi folks and philosophers are the</p>
<p>the only ones thinking about it currently. And that&rsquo;s what these folks have convinced me.</p>
<p>Yeah. And engineers aren&rsquo;t, which is, I get, yeah, most of the things I talk about, I get kind of</p>
<p>people roll their eyes from the engineer perspective.</p>
<p>Not these folks. They&rsquo;re like, because again, I saw your name and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>wait a minute, I&rsquo;ve just seen that. They&rsquo;re like, here&rsquo;s someone.</p>
<p>You should check out.</p>
<p>Yeah. So this was a delightful conference.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was a huge fan of your work and Ernest Becker. And it&rsquo;s funny that not enough people are</p>
<p>talking about it. I don&rsquo;t know what to do with that. I think that there&rsquo;s a possibility to create</p>
<p>real deep, meaningful connections between AI systems and humans.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And I think some of these things of fear mortality are essential, are essential for</p>
<p>the element of human experience. I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t think it might be essential to create</p>
<p>general intelligence, like very intelligent machines, but to create a machine that connects</p>
<p>to human in some deep way.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your view, not to make me the interviewer, but what&rsquo;s your view about machine ethics? Can</p>
<p>you imagine an ethical AI without some semblance of finitude, let&rsquo;s say?</p>
<p>Well, I think ethics is a, there&rsquo;s a trolley problem that&rsquo;s often used in the work that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done at MIT with autonomous vehicles in particular.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>That people, I think they offload, they ask, like, how would a machine deal with an ethical</p>
<p>situation that they themselves, the humans don&rsquo;t know how to deal with?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t know if a machine is able to do a better job on difficult ethical questions,</p>
<p>but I certainly think to behave properly and effectively in this world is a very important</p>
<p>thing. Effectively in this world, it needs to be, have a fear of mortality and like be</p>
<p>able to even dance. Because I don&rsquo;t think you can solve ethical problems, but you have</p>
<p>to, I think like ethics is like a dance floor. You have to just, you have to dance properly</p>
<p>with the rest of the humans. Like if people are dancing tango, you have to dance in the</p>
<p>same kind of way. And for that, you have to have a fear of mortality. Like I think of,</p>
<p>more practically speaking, as I said, autonomous vehicles, like the way you interact with pedestrians</p>
<p>fundamentally has to have a sense of mortality. So when pedestrians cross the road,</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;ve watched, well, certainly 100 plus hours of pedestrian videos.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of social contract where you walk in front of a car and you&rsquo;re putting</p>
<p>your life in the hands of another human being.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And like death is in the car, in the game that&rsquo;s being played, death is right there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of the calculus. It&rsquo;s not, but it&rsquo;s not like a simple calculus. It&rsquo;s not a simple</p>
<p>equation. I mean, I don&rsquo;t know what it is, but it&rsquo;s in there and it has to be part of</p>
<p>the optimization problem. Like it&rsquo;s not as simple as, so from the computer vision, from</p>
<p>the artificial intelligence perspective, it&rsquo;s detecting there&rsquo;s a human estimating the trajectory,</p>
<p>like treating everything like it&rsquo;s a billiard balls, as opposed to like being able to calculate</p>
<p>it, being able to construct an effective model, the world model of what the person&rsquo;s thinking,</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re going to do, what are the different possibilities of how the scene might evolve,</p>
<p>I think requires having some sense of, yeah, fear of fear of mortality, of mortality.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see the, the thing is, I think it&rsquo;s really important to think about, I can be</p>
<p>honest enough to say that it&rsquo;s, I haven&rsquo;t been able to figure out how to engineer any</p>
<p>of these things. But I do think it&rsquo;s really, really important. Like I have, so I have a</p>
<p>bunch of Roombas here. I can show it to you after that. Roombas is a robot that does</p>
<p>vacuums the floor and I&rsquo;ve had them make different sounds. Like I had them scream in pain</p>
<p>and it, you immediately anthropomorphize and it creates, I don&rsquo;t know, knowing that they</p>
<p>can feel pain. See, I&rsquo;m speaking, like knowing that I immediately imagine that they can feel</p>
<p>pain and it immediately draws me closer to them, the human experience. And that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something in that that should be engineered in our systems, it feels like. I believe,</p>
<p>personally, I don&rsquo;t know what you think, but I believe it&rsquo;s possible for a robot and a</p>
<p>human to fall in love, for example, in the future.</p>
<p>Oh, I think it&rsquo;s, yeah, it&rsquo;s already there.</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s a certain kind of deep connection with technology. I mean, a real, like you</p>
<p>would choose to marry.</p>
<p>I mean, again, it sounds, I&rsquo;ll find a book title and I&rsquo;ll send it to you. And it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>serious consideration of people who started out with these sex dolls, but it turned into</p>
<p>a relationship of enduring significance that the woman who wrote the book is not willing</p>
<p>to dismiss as a perversion.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what, you know, people kind of joke about sex robots, which is funny. Like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a funny, I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff about robots. It&rsquo;s just kind of fun to talk</p>
<p>about that is not necessarily connected to reality. People joke about sex robots, but</p>
<p>if you actually look how sex robots, which are pretty rare these days, are used, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not used by people who want sex.</p>
<p>Precisely.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually,</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re kind of,</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually,</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re companions.</p>
<p>They become companions.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, yeah, it&rsquo;s fascinating. And they&rsquo;re just, we&rsquo;re not even talking about any kind</p>
<p>of intelligence. We&rsquo;re talking about just, I mean, human beings seek companionships.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re deeply lonely. I mean, that was the other sense I have that I don&rsquo;t know if I</p>
<p>can articulate clearly. You can probably do a better job, but I have a sense that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a deep loneliness within all of us.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>In the face of death, it feels like we&rsquo;re alone.</p>
<p>So, you know, the, what drew me to the existential take on things, Lex, was the,</p>
<p>who is it, Rollo May and Erwin Yallem write about existentialism and they&rsquo;re like, look,</p>
<p>what, there&rsquo;s different flavors of existentialism, but they all have in common, what is it,</p>
<p>four universal concerns. The overriding one is about death. And that next is choice and</p>
<p>responsibility. The next one is existential isolation. And they&rsquo;re like, that&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>things about consciousness that, and the last one is meaninglessness, but the existential</p>
<p>isolation point is, you know, we are by virtue of consciousness able to apprehend that unless</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a Siamese twin, you are fundamentally alone. And because it is claimed, it&rsquo;s Eric</p>
<p>Fromm in a book called Escape from Freedom. He&rsquo;s like, look, you&rsquo;re smart enough to know that the</p>
<p>most direct way that we typically communicate with our fellow human beings is through language.</p>
<p>But you also know that language is a pale shadow of the totality of our interior</p>
<p>phenomenological existence. Therefore, there&rsquo;s always going to be times in our lives where even</p>
<p>under the best of circumstances, you could be trying desperately to convey your thoughts and</p>
<p>feelings and somebody listening could be like, yeah, I get it, I get it, I get it. And you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like, you have no fucking idea what I&rsquo;m talking about. So you can be desperately lonely in a house</p>
<p>where you live with 10 people in the middle of Tokyo where there&rsquo;s millions.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s the Great Gatsby. You could be alone in a big party.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Maybe this is a small tangent, but let me ask you on the topic of academia,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind of, we talked about Jordan Peterson, there&rsquo;s a lot of sort of renegade type of thinkers,</p>
<p>certainly in psychology, but it applies in all disciplines. What are your thoughts about academia</p>
<p>being a place to harbor people like yourself? People who think deeply about things, who are</p>
<p>not constrained by sort of the, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re quite controversial.</p>
<p>No, not really.</p>
<p>But you are a person who thinks deeply about things and it feels like academia can sometimes</p>
<p>stifle that.</p>
<p>I think so. So my concern right now, Lex, for young scholars is that the restrictions and</p>
<p>expectations are such that it&rsquo;s highly unlikely that anybody will do anything</p>
<p>of great value or innovation except for, and this is not a bad thing, but stepwise improvement</p>
<p>of existing paradigms. So in simple English, I went to Princeton for a job interview 40 years</p>
<p>ago and they&rsquo;re like, what are you going to do if we give you a job? And I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I want to think about it and read. And I saw that that interview was over, the window of</p>
<p>opportunity shut in my face and they actually called my mentors and they&rsquo;re like, what are</p>
<p>you doing? Tell this guy to buy some pants. I had hair down to my waist also. He&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>this guy looks like Charles Manson in Jesus. But the expectation is that you come to a</p>
<p>post, you start publishing so that you can get grants.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s certainly true. But there&rsquo;s also kind of a behavioral thing. You said like long hair.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain style of the way you&rsquo;re supposed to behave. For example, I&rsquo;m wearing</p>
<p>a suit. It sounds weird, but I feel comfortable in this. I wore it when I was teaching at MIT,</p>
<p>I wore it to meetings and so on, the different, sometimes a blue and red tie, but that was an</p>
<p>outsider thing to do at MIT. So there was a strong pressure to not wear a suit.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a pressure to behave, to have a hair thing, the way you wear your hair,</p>
<p>the way you, this isn&rsquo;t like a liberal or a left or anything. It&rsquo;s just in tribes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And academia to me or a place, any place that dreams of having like renegade free thinkers,</p>
<p>like really deep thinkers should in fact, like glorify the outsider. Should welcome</p>
<p>just, should welcome people that don&rsquo;t fit in.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, that sounds weird, but I can just imagine an interview with at Princeton,</p>
<p>I can imagine why aren&rsquo;t people, why aren&rsquo;t you at Harvard, for example, or MIT?</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, so that, look, I would love to, I haven&rsquo;t lectured at MIT, but I&rsquo;ve lectured at</p>
<p>Harvard. I&rsquo;ve gotten to lecture at almost every place that wouldn&rsquo;t consider me for a job.</p>
<p>And I, well, a few things. I&rsquo;m lucky because I go to Princeton, I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t know what I</p>
<p>want to do. And then two days later I go to Skidmore and I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t know what I want</p>
<p>to do. And they offer me a job later that day, which I declined for months because of the</p>
<p>extraordinary pressure of my mentors who right mindedly felt that I wouldn&rsquo;t get much done there.</p>
<p>But what they told me at Skidmore was take your time, show up for your classes and don&rsquo;t molest</p>
<p>barnyard animals and you&rsquo;ll probably get tenure. And I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;ll show up for my classes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about it.</p>
<p>That was the negotiation.</p>
<p>Yeah, I negotiated, I drove a hard bargain. But honestly, Lex, that&rsquo;s, I feel I&rsquo;m very committed</p>
<p>to Skidmore because I was given tenure when our first terror management paper wasn&rsquo;t published.</p>
<p>It took eight years to publish. It was rejected at every journal. And I submitted it as like a</p>
<p>purple ditto sheet thing. I&rsquo;m like, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been doing. Here&rsquo;s the reviews. Here&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>I think this is still a pretty good idea. And I don&rsquo;t know that this would happen even at Skidmore</p>
<p>anymore. But I was very lucky to be given the latitude and to be encouraged. I took classes</p>
<p>at Skidmore. That&rsquo;s how I learned all this stuff. I graduated, I got a PhD unscathed by knowledge.</p>
<p>We were great statisticians and methodologists, but we didn&rsquo;t have any substance. And I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mean this cynically, but we were trained in a method in search of a question. So I appreciate</p>
<p>having five years at Skidmore basically to read books. And I also appreciate that I look like</p>
<p>this 40 years ago. And my view is that this is how I comported myself. Other people, the guy I learned</p>
<p>the most from at Skidmore is now dead, a history professor, Ted Kuroda. He wore a bow tie. And</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another guy, Darnell Rucker, who taught me about philosophy. And he was very proper. And</p>
<p>he had his jacket with the leather patches. But these guys weren&rsquo;t pompous at all. They were,</p>
<p>this is the way I am. And I always felt that that&rsquo;s important that somebody who looks at you</p>
<p>and says, oh, what a stiff, he&rsquo;s probably an MBA. Well, they&rsquo;re wrong. And someone who looks at me,</p>
<p>when I first got to Skidmore, other professors would ask when I&rsquo;d be coming to their office to</p>
<p>empty the garbage. They just assumed, as in my twenties, they assumed I was housekeeping.</p>
<p>I always felt that was important that the students learn not to judge an idea by the appearance of</p>
<p>the person who pervades it. I guess this is such a high concern now because I personally still</p>
<p>have faith that academia is where the great geniuses will come from and great ideas.</p>
<p>I love hearing you say that. I still, and it&rsquo;s one of the reasons why I&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>apprehensive about the future of education right now in the context of the pandemic is that a lot</p>
<p>of folks, a lot of these are Google type people who I don&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;re geniuses also, but I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like this idea that all learning can be virtual and that much could happen. I&rsquo;m big on embodied</p>
<p>environments with actual humans interacting. I mean, there&rsquo;s so much to the university education,</p>
<p>but I think the key part is the mentorship that occurs somehow at the human level. Like I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>gotten a lot of flack, like this conversation where in person now, and I&rsquo;ve even with Edward</p>
<p>Snowden who done all interviews remote, I&rsquo;m a stickler to in person. It has to be in person</p>
<p>like, and a lot of people just don&rsquo;t get it. They&rsquo;re like, well, why can&rsquo;t, this is so much</p>
<p>easier. Like why go through the pain? Like I&rsquo;ve traveled, I&rsquo;m traveling in the next month to Paris</p>
<p>for a single stupid conversation. Nobody cares about just to be in person. Well, it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>to me. I honestly, I was like this, and thank you for coming down to it. It&rsquo;s my pleasure,</p>
<p>but again, it&rsquo;s very self serving. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed this. I knew I was going to, but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not about our enjoyment per se. Again, at the risk of sounding cavalier,</p>
<p>there are a host of factors beyond verbal that I don&rsquo;t believe can be adequately captured. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>care how much the acuity is decent on a zoom conversation. I feel again, I felt within five</p>
<p>minutes that this was going to be for me easy in the sense that I could speak freely. I just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see that happening so easily from a distance. Yeah, I tend to, well, I&rsquo;m hopeful. I agree with</p>
<p>you on the current technology, but I am hopeful on like some others on the technology eventually</p>
<p>being able to create that kind of experience or quite far away from that, but it might be</p>
<p>able to, my hope is, you know, I&rsquo;m hopeful. I was at Microsoft in Seattle and I can&rsquo;t remember why.</p>
<p>And no, I can&rsquo;t. I, that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;m in my early Mr. Magoo phase. And somebody there was showing us</p>
<p>like a virtual wall where the entire wall, you know, when you&rsquo;re talking to somebody, so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>life size and they were beginning the, get the appearance of motion and stuff. It looked pretty.</p>
<p>Yeah. With virtual reality too, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever been inside a virtual world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to me, it&rsquo;s I can just see the future. It&rsquo;s quite real in terms of like a terror of death.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid of heights. Me too. And there&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever tried, you should,</p>
<p>if you haven&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s a virtual reality experience where you can walk a plank. Yeah.</p>
<p>You can look down and man, I was on the ground like, I was like, I was afraid. I was deeply afraid.</p>
<p>I was, it was, it was as real as, as anything else could be. And I mean, these are very early days</p>
<p>of that technology, relatively speaking. So yeah. I mean, I don&rsquo;t know what to do with that. Same</p>
<p>with like crossing the street, we did these experiments across the street in front of a car</p>
<p>and, you know, it&rsquo;s being run over by a car. It&rsquo;s terrifying. Yeah. It&rsquo;s just that, yeah. So there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a rich experience to be created there. We&rsquo;re not there yet, but, yeah. And I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of people</p>
<p>try, like you said, the Google folks, Silicon Valley folks try to create a virtual online</p>
<p>education. I don&rsquo;t know. I think they&rsquo;ve raised really important questions. Absolutely. Like what</p>
<p>makes the education experience fulfilling? What makes it effective? Yeah. These are important</p>
<p>questions. And I think what they highlight is we have no clue. Like, there&rsquo;s, Thomas Sowell</p>
<p>wrote a book about, a recent book on charter schools. Yeah. I would like to talk to him. Yeah,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s an interesting guy. We will disagree about a lot, but respectfully. Yeah. Such a powerful mind.</p>
<p>Yeah. But he, I need to read, I&rsquo;ve only heard him talk about the book, but he argues quite</p>
<p>seemingly effectively that the public education system is broken. That we blame, he basically says</p>
<p>that we kind of blame, like the conditions or the environment, but the upbringing of people,</p>
<p>like parenting, blah, blah, blah, like the set of opportunities. But okay, putting that aside,</p>
<p>it seems like charter schools, no matter who it is that attends them, does much better than in</p>
<p>public schools. And he puts a bunch of data behind it. And in his usual way, as you know, just is</p>
<p>very eloquent in arguing his points. Yeah. So that to me just highlights, man, we don&rsquo;t, education</p>
<p>is like one of the most important, it&rsquo;s probably the most important thing in our civilization,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re doing a shitty job of it. Yeah. In academia, in university education and, you know,</p>
<p>younger education, the whole thing. The whole thing. And yet, we value</p>
<p>just about anyone or anything more than educators. You know, part of it is just the</p>
<p>relatively low regard that Americans have for teachers. Also similarly, like just people</p>
<p>of service. I think great teachers are the greatest thing in our society. And I would say,</p>
<p>now on a controversial note, like Black Lives Matter, you know, great police officers is the</p>
<p>greatest thing in our society. Also, like all people that do service, we undervalue cops severe,</p>
<p>like this whole defund the police is missing the point. And it&rsquo;s a stupid word. I&rsquo;m with you on</p>
<p>that, Lex. Our neighbors to one side of our house are three generations of police, our neighbors</p>
<p>across the street are police. They know my, you know, political predilections. And we&rsquo;ve gotten</p>
<p>along fine for 30 years. And I go out and tell them every day, you know, when you go in today,</p>
<p>you tell the people on the force that I appreciate what they&rsquo;re doing. I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really important to not tribalize those concerns. I mean, we mentioned so many brilliant books and</p>
<p>philosophers, but it&rsquo;d be nice to sort of in a focused way, try to see if we can get some</p>
<p>recommendations from you. So what three books, technical or fiction or philosophical had a big</p>
<p>impact in your life and you would recommend. Spent four hours driving here, perseverating about</p>
<p>that. I didn&rsquo;t, I, everything else you sent me as fine. And I actually, I skimmed it and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to look at it because I want, I want us to talk. The ones in blue. I&rsquo;m like, all right.</p>
<p>And you know, I&rsquo;ve already said that I&rsquo;ve found backers work and I put the denial of death out</p>
<p>there. Um, is that his best, sorry, a small tangent. Is there other books that of his?</p>
<p>Yes. If I could have this count as one that the, the birth and death of meaning,</p>
<p>the denial of death and escape from evil are three books of Ernest Becker&rsquo;s that I believe to</p>
<p>all be profound in a, in a little sort of brief dance around topics. Um, I&rsquo;ve only read denial</p>
<p>of death. Like, well, how do those books connect in here? Yeah. Nice. So the, the birth and death</p>
<p>of meaning is where Becker situates his thinking in more of an evolutionary foundation. So I like</p>
<p>that for that reason. Escape from evil is where he applies the ideas in the denial of death</p>
<p>more directly, um, to economic matters and to inequality and also to our inability to</p>
<p>peacefully coexist with other folks who don&rsquo;t share our beliefs. So I would put Ernest Becker</p>
<p>out there as one. Um, I also like novels a lot. And here I was like, God damn it. No matter what</p>
<p>I say, I&rsquo;m going to be like, yes, but, but the existentialists, do you like all those folks?</p>
<p>Come on. You like that literary existential? I do. But I mean, you know, I, I&rsquo;ve read all those</p>
<p>books. I will tell you the last line of the plague. We learn in times of pestilence that there&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>to admire in men than to despise. And I love that. Yeah. Plagues such a, I don&rsquo;t know. I,</p>
<p>I find the plague is a brilliant before, before, uh, the plague has come to us in 2020.</p>
<p>I, it was just a book about love about, but I&rsquo;ll toss a one that may be less known to folks. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>enamored with a novel by a woman named Carson McCullers written in 1953 called clock without</p>
<p>hands. And I find it a brilliant literary depiction of many of the ideas that we have spoken about.</p>
<p>Fiction?</p>
<p>Fiction. Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s, uh, what kind of ideas are we talking about?</p>
<p>Oh, it, it, all of the existential ideas that we have encountered today,</p>
<p>but in the context of a story of someone who finds out that he is terminally ill,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s set in the South and the, um, heyday of like segregation. So there&rsquo;s a lot of social issues,</p>
<p>a lot of existential issues, but it&rsquo;s basically a novel, a fictional account of someone who finds</p>
<p>out that they&rsquo;re terminally ill and who reacts originally as, um, uh, you might expect anyone,</p>
<p>uh, becomes more, um, hostile to people who are different, like petty and stupid denies that</p>
<p>anything&rsquo;s happening. But, uh, as the book goes on and he comes more to terms, um, with his own</p>
<p>mortality, um, it ends lovingly. And then, uh, back to your idea about, you know, love being</p>
<p>incredibly potent.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the, the nice thing, as you mentioned, uh, before with, with Heidegger,</p>
<p>I really liked that idea. And I&rsquo;ve seen that in people who are terminally ill is they bring,</p>
<p>you know, the idea of death becomes, uh, current. It becomes like a thing, you know, I could die.</p>
<p>I really liked that idea. I, I can die. Not just tomorrow, but like now, now, now.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, that&rsquo;s a really useful, I don&rsquo;t even know. I think I&rsquo;ve been too afraid to even think about</p>
<p>that. Like, like, like sit here and think like in five minutes,</p>
<p>in five minutes, it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>This is it. This is five minutes. It&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>Yeah. So that would be my most recent addition as I really am struck by Heidegger.</p>
<p>Would you recommend that?</p>
<p>Well, okay. Well, if you have a few years,</p>
<p>I remember I tuned out being in time. I was like, I tried to read it. I was like, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>It took me 40 years to read Ulysses that could not get past the first five pages. And it took</p>
<p>me 40 years to read being in time. It&rsquo;s a slog.</p>
<p>And I took a James Joyce course in college. So I&rsquo;ve, uh, I, I even, uh, I, I guess read parts</p>
<p>of Finnegan&rsquo;s Wake.</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>But like, there&rsquo;s a difference between reading and like, I don&rsquo;t think I understood anything.</p>
<p>I like his, uh, short stories on the dead, the dead. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. I love that. And, um, I like Faulkner, Absalom. Absalom is a, is a fine book.</p>
<p>But would you, uh, is there something Heidegger connected in a book you would recommend or no?</p>
<p>No. So maybe I got to abandon him. I mean, I mean, being in time is, is awesome. Um,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s an interesting thing and not to get all academic, but, you know, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two parts to it. And most of the, most philosophers are preoccupied with the first part.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the second part where he gets into all the flight from death stuff and this idea of,</p>
<p>you know, a turning and philosophers don&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, this is where he&rsquo;s starting to really shine, to really shine for me.</p>
<p>So, yeah. Yeah. All right. That&rsquo;s a beautiful set of books. So what, um, advice would you give to</p>
<p>a young person today about their career, about life, about, uh, how to survive in this world</p>
<p>full of suffering? Yeah. Great. Um, my advice is to get competent advice. That&rsquo;s what I tell my</p>
<p>students that don&rsquo;t listen to me. Don&rsquo;t listen to me. Well, you know, I think, um,</p>
<p>my, my big piece of advice these days is, you know, again, it&rsquo;s at the risk of sounding</p>
<p>like a simpleton, but it&rsquo;s to emphasize a few things. One is, um, you know,</p>
<p>so, uh, one of your questions I think was, you know, what&rsquo;s the meaning of life. And of course,</p>
<p>the existentialists say life has no meaning, but it doesn&rsquo;t follow from that, that it&rsquo;s intrinsic,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s meaningless. You know what the existential point is not that life is</p>
<p>meaningless so much as it doesn&rsquo;t have one inevitable and intrinsic meaning, you know,</p>
<p>which then it opens up, uh, you know, I think it was Kierkegaard who said consciousness gives us</p>
<p>the possibility of possibilities. And, but there&rsquo;s another lunatic Oswald Spangler who wrote a book</p>
<p>called, uh, decline of the West. And he says that the philosopher, the German philosopher Gerta,</p>
<p>he says, the purpose of life is to live. And I let that&rsquo;s, so that&rsquo;s one of my pieces of advice.</p>
<p>So the possibility of possibilities, it&rsquo;s interesting. So what do you do with this</p>
<p>kind of sea of possibilities? Like, well, this is one of the, when, when young folks</p>
<p>talk to me, especially these days, uh, is there swimming in a sea of possibilities?</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, so this is great. And so that&rsquo;s another existential point, which is that</p>
<p>we yearn for freedom. We react vigorously when we perceive that our choices have been curtailed</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re paralyzed by indecision in the wake of seemingly unlimited possibilities,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re not choking on choice. And, and I&rsquo;m not sure if this is helpful advice or not,</p>
<p>but what I say to folks is that the fact of the matter is, is the, you know, for most people,</p>
<p>choice is a first world problem. And sometimes the best option is to do something as silly as</p>
<p>it sounds. And then if that doesn&rsquo;t work, do something else, which just sounds like my mom</p>
<p>torturing me, uh, when I was young. But you know, part of the thing that I find myself singularly</p>
<p>ill equipped is that we&rsquo;re at the, I may be at the tail end of the last generation of Americans</p>
<p>where you like picked something and that&rsquo;s what you did. Like I&rsquo;ve been at a job for 40 years</p>
<p>where you can expect to do better than your parents cause those days are gone.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And where you can make a comfortable inference that the world in a decade or two will have any</p>
<p>remote similarity to the one that we now inhabit. And so.</p>
<p>But still you recommend just do.</p>
<p>Yeah. And to do so I&rsquo;m again, I&rsquo;m, this is, I&rsquo;m so back to the Heidegger guy because,</p>
<p>all right, I may, you know, I consider myself a professor, but what happens if most of the</p>
<p>schools go out of business? Somebody else may consider themselves a restaurant tour,</p>
<p>but what happens if there&rsquo;s no more restaurants? So what I, this is negative advice, but I tell</p>
<p>folks, don&rsquo;t define yourself as a social caricature. Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t limit how you feel about yourself by,</p>
<p>through identification with a host of variables that may be uncertain.</p>
<p>Maybe temporary.</p>
<p>And temporary.</p>
<p>What,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say. No, but of course that gets back to your point earlier, Lex, where you&rsquo;re like, yeah,</p>
<p>but when you step out of that, it&rsquo;s extraordinarily discombobulating.</p>
<p>So what, I think you talked about an ax of chopping wood and soul from Socrates.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What is your soul? What is the, the essence of Schellen?</p>
<p>Wow. That was like, awesome.</p>
<p>Like when God, when you, when you show up at the end of this thing, he kind of looks at you,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like, oh yeah, yeah, I remember you.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, you know, I, to be honest, what I muse about,</p>
<p>is to me, the, when, when people are, I told you, I have to, we have two kids, late 20s, early 30s.</p>
<p>And over the years, when people, when we meet people that know our kids and they&rsquo;re like, oh,</p>
<p>your kids are kind and decent. And I&rsquo;d be like, that&rsquo;s what I would like to be.</p>
<p>Because I think intelligence is vastly overrated. You know, the Unabomber was a smart guy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I do admire intelligence and I do venerate education and I find that to be</p>
<p>tremendously important. But if I had to pay the ultimate homage to myself,</p>
<p>it would be to be known as somebody who takes himself too seriously to take myself too seriously.</p>
<p>Again, as corny as it sounds, I&rsquo;d like to leave the world a time when I can be known as somebody</p>
<p>who takes himself too seriously. Again, as corny as it sounds, I&rsquo;d like to leave the world</p>
<p>a tad better than I found it, or at least do no harm.</p>
<p>And, I think you, I think you did all right in that, in that regard.</p>
<p>I love that question, Alex. That&rsquo;s a good one. I think everyone should be asked that.</p>
<p>What is your soul?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of lingering questions around it.</p>
<p>So, I mean, on the point of the soul, you&rsquo;ve talked about the meaning of life. Do you have,</p>
<p>on a personal level, do you have an answer to the meaning of your life, of something that brought you</p>
<p>meaning, happiness, some sense of sense?</p>
<p>No, I mean, yes and no. I mean, I&rsquo;m 66, so I&rsquo;m in the kind of</p>
<p>and not ready to wrap it up, literally or metaphorically, but you look, I look back and</p>
<p>just really with a sense of awe and wonder, gratitude, and</p>
<p>Is there memories that stand out to you from childhood, from earlier, that like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, you know, stand out as something you&rsquo;re really proud of or just happy to have been on this</p>
<p>earth, because that stuff happened.</p>
<p>Yeah, that. I mean, you know, my family, also a chunk, my folks, my grandparents are from Eastern</p>
<p>Europe, you know, Russia, Austria. As far as we know, some of them never made it out. I consider</p>
<p>myself very fortunate to have been a so called product of the American dream. You know, my</p>
<p>grandparents were basically peasants. My parents, my dad worked two full time jobs when I was growing</p>
<p>up, and I would see him on the weekends. I&rsquo;d be like, why are you working all the time? He&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>like, so you won&rsquo;t have to. And he said, Look, the world does not owe you a living. And so your first</p>
<p>responsibility is to take care of yourself. And then your next responsibility is to take care of</p>
<p>other people. And I think you did a pretty good job with that. I don&rsquo;t know. But I so that those</p>
<p>are the things that I&rsquo;m proud of.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s funny. You&rsquo;ve been, you&rsquo;ve talked about just yourself as a human being. But you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>also contributed some really important ideas for your ideas and also kind of integrating and maybe</p>
<p>even popularizing the work of Ernest Becker of connecting it of making it legitimate scientifically.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, as a human, of course, you want to be you want your ripple to be one that makes the</p>
<p>world a better place. But also, I think, in the span of time, I think it&rsquo;s of great value. You&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>contributed in terms of how we think about the human condition, how we think about ourselves,</p>
<p>assuming as finite beings in this world. And I hope also in our technology of engineering</p>
<p>intelligence, I think, at least, at least for me, and I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a lot of other people</p>
<p>like me that your work has been a gift for so well, thank you.</p>
<p>Oh, I like that. And we have described ourselves as giant interneurons. I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>we have had no original ideas. And maybe that&rsquo;s the only thing that&rsquo;s original about our work is</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t claim to be original. What we claim to have done is to integrate and to connect</p>
<p>these disparate and superficially unconnected discourses, you know, so existentialists,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d be like, evidence? What&rsquo;s that? And yeah, there&rsquo;s now a branch of psychology, experimental,</p>
<p>existential psychology that I think we could take credit for having encouraged the formation of.</p>
<p>And that, in turn, has gotten these ideas in circulation and academic communities where they</p>
<p>may not have otherwise gotten. So I think that&rsquo;s good. Well, Sheldon, it&rsquo;s a huge honor. I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>believe you came down here. I&rsquo;ve been a fan of your work. I hope we get to talk again. Huge honor</p>
<p>to talk to you. Thank you so much for talking today. Thanks, Lex. We&rsquo;ll do it again soon, I hope.</p>
