<p>ready i do my makeup it just keeps me busy you know</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in true crime</p>
<p>and you like makeup i would suggest</p>

<p>get this recommendation from my comment section and it</p>
<p>i keep seeing this name pop up over and over and over</p>
<p>again bailey please do the toy box killer bailey</p>
<p>do the toy box killer bailey</p>
<p>toy box killer i kept saying it over and over</p>
<p>again and i don&rsquo;t i must have been living</p>
<p>under a rock i had</p>
<p>never heard of this person before</p>
<p>and my first thought was oh it&rsquo;s probably like a</p>
<p>child&rsquo;s killer or something and honestly like i</p>
<p>would just child killers or</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s all bad all killers</p>
<p>are bad but i just wasn&rsquo;t in i don&rsquo;t want to have a</p>
<p>child killer anyways</p>
<p>after i did some googling</p>
<p>i realized it&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>child killer but he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how i feel</p>
<p>about today&rsquo;s</p>
<p>story case whatever it makes</p>
<p>awesome i have to add a very</p>
<p>very heavy disclaimer to</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s story</p>
<p>case warning</p>
<p>the following presentation</p>
<p>is intended for</p>
<p>mature audiences</p>
<p>it contains</p>
<p>graphic descriptions of</p>
<p>crime scenes and i&rsquo;m talking very graphic</p>
<p>adult dialogue and</p>

<p>abuse it&rsquo;s very graphic</p>
<p>and if you are sensitive at all to any of that i</p>
<p>would say please please please just skip this one</p>

<p>graphic this is and i fully</p>
<p>blame you guys</p>
<p>this is your</p>
<p>fault you recommended this case i had never</p>
<p>heard of this</p>
<p>and i was living my life happily</p>
<p>until i heard</p>
<p>about this guy</p>
<p>okay let&rsquo;s get into the toy box killer</p>
<p>so the toy box killer his real name is</p>
<p>david parker ray</p>
<p>he was born</p>
<p>on november 6 1939 and he</p>
<p>lived in new mexico</p>
<p>a little bit</p>
<p>about like his upbringing his father</p>
<p>was an abusive</p>
<p>drunk who treated his wife</p>
<p>david and david&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sister peggy</p>
<p>very poorly very</p>
<p>abusive controlling bad</p>
<p>awful awful awful</p>
<p>the couple divorced when</p>
<p>david was 10 and the three</p>
<p>moved to live with grandfather he had really</p>
<p>strict rules and he</p>
<p>expected everyone</p>
<p>under the roof to follow them</p>
<p>failing to follow his rules met with physical</p>
<p>very violent abuse</p>
<p>while his father did not live with them he</p>
<p>visited the family periodically</p>
<p>and when he</p>
<p>would visit david</p>
<p>he would give him pornographic</p>
<p>magazines and a lot of them would be</p>
<p>honographic</p>
<p>magazines that</p>
<p>would show a lot of bdsm</p>
<p>just really intense there is</p>
<p>absolutely 100</p>
<p>nothing wrong with</p>
<p>bdsm if you are into it i am not shaming whatsoever</p>
<p>you were allowed to be</p>
<p>into whatever you want sexually</p>
<p>well i mean</p>
<p>except for like animals and shit like</p>
<p>that but you get what i&rsquo;m saying like no judging here</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not blaming</p>
<p>bdsm on anything</p>
<p>okay never mind just shut up so</p>
<p>david&rsquo;s mother</p>
<p>was reported</p>
<p>to like not be around at all</p>
<p>so when they had divorce the parents</p>
<p>david&rsquo;s mother just kind of</p>
<p>disappeared okay from what i read she was an alcoholic</p>
<p>and abused drugs and she just</p>
<p>sadly chose that</p>
<p>and she just disappeared so really she</p>
<p>had no contact with the children and the family at all</p>
<p>so david was also</p>
<p>mentally and physically beaten</p>
<p>pretty severely by bullies at</p>
<p>school all the way from</p>
<p>grade school</p>
<p>until he graduated high school</p>
<p>david was really awkward and shy and it</p>
<p>made it made him a</p>
<p>target for bullies</p>
<p>getting abused at home and then getting abused at</p>
<p>school obviously it just</p>
<p>it did a lot of damage to him usually</p>
<p>school is somewhere</p>
<p>where you can at</p>
<p>least escape your shitty home life</p>
<p>and for david it was like he</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t escape it anywhere and i just have to say side</p>
<p>note a lot of the times when i mention</p>
<p>these awful killers having a hard upbringing i see</p>
<p>a handful of comments from people suggesting that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>siding with the bad guy or the killer</p>
<p>or i&rsquo;m making it more</p>
<p>about him or her being a</p>
<p>victim and i just have to say</p>
<p>shut up just</p>
<p>so you know i&rsquo;m not making excuses for them</p>
<p>personally like when i read</p>
<p>these stories</p>
<p>about serial killers and</p>
<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>i like to know the full</p>
<p>story i like to see the</p>
<p>whole background</p>
<p>where they came</p>
<p>from did they come from a good family did</p>
<p>they come from a bad family am i saying that if you are</p>
<p>abused or anything as a</p>
<p>child you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna grow up to be a serial killer</p>
<p>absolutely 100</p>
<p>not no for me personally</p>
<p>i just like to get the full</p>
<p>story and i know some of you guys do as well so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why i put it in i am not trying to make this out to be</p>
<p>about the serial killer being the</p>
<p>victim i&rsquo;m just giving the full story</p>
<p>okay so during high school</p>
<p>david began to</p>
<p>experiment with drugs and</p>
<p>alcohol during this time of abusing drugs and alcohol</p>
<p>is when david</p>
<p>began to form a fascination with pornography</p>
<p>and then the bdsm</p>
<p>he had like a</p>
<p>collection that he kept that</p>
<p>his dad had</p>
<p>given him over time</p>
<p>you know this was the 50s and 60s</p>
<p>so it was definitely it was very different</p>
<p>it was just</p>
<p>different i mean come on 50s and 60s was just</p>
<p>seem like the most judgmental time to be</p>
<p>alive so peggy</p>
<p>david&rsquo;s sister</p>
<p>she found a</p>
<p>bunch of his pornography the</p>
<p>pretty gnarly</p>
<p>stuff he had</p>
<p>photos he had drawings that</p>
<p>david had made and he was 14 at this time and</p>
<p>again this was in</p>
<p>the 50s and 60s so this was something just way uncommon</p>
<p>and when she</p>
<p>found this it</p>
<p>alarmed her okay like</p>
<p>alarmed her she was probably like what the</p>
<p>book i have to add some</p>
<p>humor to this because this</p>
<p>story is so</p>
<p>heavy and if i joke around a lot look</p>
<p>i have to it&rsquo;s the only way i can get through this one</p>
<p>she never spoke about it</p>
<p>until his trial</p>
<p>decades later</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll get into she</p>
<p>never said anything</p>
<p>on the outside looking in</p>
<p>david appeared to be making the best of his</p>
<p>pretty shitty</p>
<p>upbringing he had joined the army and he received an</p>
<p>honorable discharge</p>
<p>and while he was in the army he worked as</p>
<p>a mechanic and throughout his</p>
<p>adult life he worked as one as well</p>
<p>he was pretty much</p>
<p>a mechanic since his</p>
<p>teenage years</p>
<p>all the way up</p>
<p>until his 50s</p>
<p>all of his co workers and his friends they</p>
<p>would all say</p>
<p>he was great at his job</p>
<p>he was always</p>
<p>teaching others how to make or fix</p>
<p>anything he was</p>
<p>super friendly he was</p>
<p>funny david he</p>
<p>would welt and he</p>
<p>would make his</p>
<p>own tools to help him be better at his job</p>
<p>and he was a</p>
<p>crafty little man</p>
<p>just like a lot of</p>
<p>these killers seem to be huh</p>
<p>we gotta be keeping an eye</p>
<p>out on these</p>
<p>crafty ones</p>
<p>so then david he had</p>
<p>married his</p>
<p>first wife i couldn&rsquo;t exactly find an age at</p>
<p>which this happened</p>
<p>but he married a lady</p>
<p>david had confided in her</p>
<p>that as a teenager he captured a woman</p>
<p>and proceeded to tie her to a tree</p>
<p>and from there tortured</p>
<p>and finally killed her so his</p>
<p>first wife she</p>
<p>reportedly she</p>
<p>took it with a</p>
<p>grain of salt</p>
<p>she thought he was just suffering</p>
<p>from some kind of mental illness</p>
<p>and she really just didn&rsquo;t do anything</p>
<p>about it she</p>
<p>would go on</p>
<p>to say that he had increasingly disturbing behavior</p>
<p>throughout their</p>
<p>marriage and that is eventually what</p>
<p>ended their</p>
<p>marriage no</p>
<p>idea what this disturbing behavior was the only</p>
<p>thing i could find was that it was disturbing so</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not really sure</p>
<p>but the fact though that he confided in her</p>
<p>about possibly killing somebody to me i feel like that</p>
<p>would have been like</p>
<p>all right i&rsquo;m out</p>
<p>you know but i give up too easily i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>so david was</p>
<p>married four times</p>
<p>and each of</p>
<p>those times</p>
<p>ended in divorce</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t really have the best luck in</p>
<p>relationships</p>
<p>so he ended up having two</p>
<p>daughters throughout the marriages</p>
<p>one of them glenda jean ray</p>
<p>and they called her jesse</p>
<p>i won&rsquo;t name the</p>
<p>other one because it kind of</p>
<p>first of all i couldn&rsquo;t really even find her name</p>
<p>second of all it kind of seemed like she didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really even want to be associated with the dude so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just leave her out of it okay</p>
<p>flash forward to his 50s he&rsquo;s in his 50s now</p>
<p>he lives in new mexico</p>
<p>he lives in a</p>
<p>small town it&rsquo;s called elephant butte</p>
<p>it looks like elephant butt</p>
<p>but i think it&rsquo;s butte</p>
<p>so i doubt they</p>
<p>would name it elephant butt</p>
<p>so adjacent</p>
<p>to elephant butte</p>
<p>is another small town</p>
<p>and it was called or it is called</p>
<p>truth or consequences</p>
<p>like this is the name of this city</p>
<p>truth or consequences</p>
<p>i am not kidding you i got so hung up on</p>
<p>these names for like a</p>
<p>solid two hours i was researching</p>
<p>who names a city</p>
<p>truth or consequences</p>
<p>i still like can&rsquo;t get over it</p>
<p>truth or consequences</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>truth it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>truth i live in</p>
<p>truth or consequences</p>
<p>anyways it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>truth or consequences</p>
<p>in this small town</p>
<p>elephant butte</p>
<p>we have truth or consequences they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right next to each</p>
<p>other right and then there&rsquo;s a large</p>
<p>reservoir and</p>
<p>a man made like lake was put in the area</p>
<p>which a lot of people thought was nice</p>
<p>a lot of people</p>
<p>thought this was nice because it was just a big old</p>
<p>lake in the middle of the desert</p>
<p>and there isn&rsquo;t anything else around so it made a</p>
<p>great area for</p>
<p>the retirement community who came there for the warmer</p>
<p>weather so was a lot of retired</p>
<p>folks out there they</p>
<p>could take their boat out onto the the lake</p>
<p>they could fish</p>
<p>sadly this area</p>
<p>it brought in a lot of drifters</p>
<p>okay it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>middle of the desert a lot of people coming and</p>
<p>going there</p>
<p>was a lot of sex workers a lot of drug addicts</p>
<p>sadly i mean</p>
<p>and they would all be in this area</p>
<p>the homeless community and the</p>
<p>drug addicts</p>
<p>they would all set up camp around the lake area</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where they</p>
<p>would all hang out so around this time in like 1999</p>
<p>the city truth or consequences</p>
<p>and elephant butte was the</p>
<p>second city in america with the highest</p>
<p>crime rate there was a</p>
<p>ton of rapes</p>
<p>murders assaults</p>
<p>sadly it was a lot of sex workers and drug addicts who</p>
<p>would end up being a</p>
<p>victim to this crimes</p>
<p>it was just really sad all the like the interviews and</p>
<p>stuff i was watching</p>
<p>about this case</p>
<p>the cops were like yeah it&rsquo;s just a lot of drug addicts</p>
<p>or sex workers</p>
<p>i mean and you see that to this day</p>
<p>if it has to do with the drug users or the sex workers</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no sense of</p>
<p>urgency to like put an end to it all you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s really sad anyway so back to</p>
<p>david he&rsquo;s out here in this area</p>
<p>truth or consequences</p>
<p>david he had</p>
<p>acquired some savings over the years he just like</p>
<p>saved all of his</p>
<p>money he had a new smoking hot</p>
<p>girlfriend by his side her name was cindy</p>
<p>he met her at his work</p>
<p>where he worked</p>
<p>at the elephant butte</p>
<p>state park and it&rsquo;s the largest</p>
<p>state park in new mexico</p>
<p>and he worked there as a mechanic</p>
<p>he met her while she was doing community service</p>
<p>or something</p>
<p>at the park and they just really hit it off and</p>
<p>started dating</p>
<p>they lived together in a double wide mobile home</p>
<p>and there was</p>
<p>a lot of land desert around not many neighbors</p>
<p>things were pretty</p>
<p>spread out everyone</p>
<p>it was pretty</p>
<p>quiet community everyone kept to</p>
<p>their own so</p>
<p>david he decided that it was time to finally</p>
<p>fulfill his lifelong</p>
<p>dream now that he had all the finances for it</p>
<p>and most importantly he had a</p>
<p>woman by his side who</p>
<p>supported his desires and was</p>
<p>ready to help him</p>
<p>build what would become the toy box</p>
<p>side note you know when you&rsquo;re watching a movie</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s got like the most random</p>
<p>title and you&rsquo;re like i wonder why they</p>
<p>named it that and then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>watching the movie and then they say the</p>
<p>title in the movie and you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>i get it now we&rsquo;re having that moment</p>
<p>so between the two of them they</p>
<p>spent over 100 000</p>
<p>on an empty and soundproof</p>
<p>trailer as well as a supplies within it the</p>
<p>trailer itself was put on his property</p>
<p>in the backyard area</p>
<p>and they stocked it with a crap ton of supplies okay</p>
<p>what kind of supplies you ask with saws</p>
<p>knives needles surgical tools whips</p>
<p>chains straps</p>
<p>a fur lined cuff and tons of doctors tools and supplies</p>
<p>electrocution</p>
<p>clamps ropes and a plethora</p>
<p>of sex toys that were intimidating</p>
<p>to most now david had decorated the walls with very</p>
<p>graphic pornographic images of women being tied up</p>
<p>gagged strangled</p>
<p>and it was now</p>
<p>their wallpaper</p>
<p>in a video i</p>
<p>saw when they were like touring the toy box it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>he like ripped out the pages of porn</p>
<p>magazines and hung them all throughout this toy box</p>
<p>so like i mentioned</p>
<p>he was a mechanic and he</p>
<p>would always</p>
<p>build and make his own tools</p>
<p>david took on a new</p>
<p>hobby of building and creating his own sex toys</p>
<p>okay look if you have children around and stuff</p>
<p>they shouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>watching this</p>
<p>no children</p>
<p>he made dildos out of plastic</p>
<p>tubes you know like pvc pipes that you get at like home</p>
<p>depot and stuff</p>
<p>not sponsored this plastic pvc pipe</p>
<p>dildo it was huge</p>
<p>at the base of the dildo were a</p>
<p>bunch of nails</p>
<p>sticking upwards</p>
<p>so it would rip and cut the skin</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about this is dildos like this fat right</p>
<p>first of all who&rsquo;s that fitting in</p>
<p>nasty and around the</p>
<p>whole base of it were</p>
<p>nails long nails</p>
<p>sticking up all the way around</p>
<p>and then there were more</p>
<p>nails at the base of the wiener like facing outwards</p>
<p>okay so this toy it was</p>
<p>obviously not made for pleasure it was made for pain</p>
<p>he made a couple of different penetration machines</p>
<p>where the wiener</p>
<p>would just like jab</p>
<p>aggressively</p>
<p>which is fine</p>
<p>again like i&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>those before but</p>
<p>again this one was made to create some kind of damage</p>
<p>it was not made for pleasure</p>
<p>there were ankle</p>
<p>spreaders but not just normal ones that are safe</p>
<p>nene these ones</p>
<p>would keep the legs open to the</p>
<p>point where your hips</p>
<p>would pop out of place</p>
<p>or your muscles would tear</p>
<p>he somehow managed to get a</p>
<p>gynecologist&rsquo;s</p>
<p>chair with the</p>
<p>stir up some shit</p>
<p>and he put that</p>
<p>in the center of the room and all his toys around</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got the</p>
<p>pornography all over the walls he&rsquo;s like yes</p>
<p>this has been my dream</p>
<p>there was a homemade</p>
<p>electrical generator that was used for torture</p>
<p>a mirror was</p>
<p>mounted on the ceiling</p>
<p>above the gynecologist&rsquo;s</p>
<p>chair so whoever was in the</p>
<p>chair could watch</p>
<p>david also made like a wooden contraption that</p>
<p>would bend his</p>
<p>victims over</p>
<p>and immobilize them while he</p>
<p>could have dogs or friends come over and</p>
<p>wicket in them</p>
<p>yes i know discussing</p>
<p>this part&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>gross too it was said that</p>
<p>david would put</p>
<p>gravy into the</p>
<p>lower area of whoever was in this contraption and he</p>
<p>would let dogs</p>
<p>just go at it</p>
<p>with david he didn&rsquo;t want consenting</p>
<p>adults okay</p>
<p>nene he wanted to kidnap</p>
<p>and create pain to his</p>
<p>victims instead</p>
<p>and also involving animals which is</p>
<p>absolutely disgusting</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s jump to march 22</p>
<p>1999 in elephant butte</p>
<p>now on this evening</p>
<p>david had posed as an</p>
<p>undercover police officer</p>
<p>and he approached a sex worker her name was cynthia</p>
<p>he approached her in a parking lot she offered him</p>
<p>think like a blowjob or something</p>
<p>he told her that she was</p>
<p>under arrest</p>
<p>for solicitation</p>
<p>of sex work</p>
<p>and then he handcuffed her</p>
<p>so he puts her</p>
<p>in the car and they</p>
<p>drive off and they get to</p>
<p>david&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>takes her into his</p>
<p>trailer his</p>
<p>house where she was then</p>
<p>handcuffed and</p>
<p>chained to a bed in the living room he had on</p>
<p>like a dog collar with a</p>
<p>bunch of like</p>
<p>spikes in it</p>
<p>completely locked on her so</p>
<p>she ended up being there for</p>
<p>about three days</p>
<p>she was in captivity</p>
<p>and cynthia was just like i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>gotta get out of here okay</p>
<p>she knew she had</p>
<p>to get out or she was</p>
<p>going to die so then</p>
<p>david he goes to work and cindy</p>
<p>david&rsquo;s girlfriend is in the house</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s supposed to supervise</p>
<p>make sure cynthia isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>getting out cindy</p>
<p>gets a phone call</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like hey</p>
<p>bitch what&rsquo;s up</p>
<p>and cynthia is on the bed she looks over</p>
<p>and she sees that cindy</p>
<p>accidentally left the keys to</p>
<p>the chains that were on her wrist</p>
<p>the keys were on the</p>
<p>table next to the bed</p>
<p>so cynthia&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>gotta get those keys</p>
<p>so cindy&rsquo;s on the</p>
<p>phone like yeah</p>
<p>starts walking away</p>
<p>and she walks into the</p>
<p>other room she&rsquo;s on the phone</p>
<p>and cynthia is like dude it&rsquo;s like now or</p>
<p>never so cynthia somehow manages</p>
<p>to like scoot her way over to the table</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s able to get the keys</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s kind of struggling she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of like you know when there&rsquo;s a lot of adrenaline</p>
<p>running through your body</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re shaking you&rsquo;re not being very</p>
<p>quiet so cindy&rsquo;s on the phone</p>
<p>and she hears like some</p>
<p>some jiggling and some</p>
<p>struggling happening and she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>let me call you back click</p>
<p>so she goes back to the room and she sees that cynthia</p>
<p>has gotten the keys and she&rsquo;s unlocking herself cynthia</p>
<p>is like her adrenaline</p>
<p>just pumping</p>
<p>so then cindy</p>
<p>jumps on top of her is trying to</p>
<p>fight her trying to like pretty much</p>
<p>knock her out</p>
<p>cindy then grabs a lamp that was on the</p>
<p>table on she</p>
<p>boom she like</p>
<p>knocks it over</p>
<p>cynthia&rsquo;s head she&rsquo;s trying to knock her</p>
<p>unconscious</p>
<p>but cynthia managed to unlock her</p>
<p>chains free her hands so then some</p>
<p>reason there&rsquo;s an ice pick that was nearby</p>
<p>and cynthia grabs the ice pick</p>
<p>and she stabs cindy with it i&rsquo;ve read different reports</p>
<p>where it was like she</p>
<p>stabbed cindy</p>
<p>in like the head</p>
<p>above her ear</p>
<p>but then i read somewhere else that oh</p>
<p>she stabbed her in the neck so she</p>
<p>stabbed her somewhere</p>
<p>like over here okay</p>
<p>stabs the bitch</p>
<p>when cindy falls onto the</p>
<p>floor cynthia just</p>
<p>flies out the</p>
<p>front door she&rsquo;s butt naked</p>
<p>she has on the doll collar on her neck</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>making a run for it so she goes down to the main road</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s yelling like trying to flag</p>
<p>down cars and she&rsquo;s like please help me like and</p>
<p>sadly like the people driving they didn&rsquo;t want any</p>
<p>they just didn&rsquo;t want to get</p>
<p>involved okay they&rsquo;re just driving and they&rsquo;re like hmm</p>
<p>now but cynthia</p>
<p>just keeps running she keeps running to different homes</p>
<p>knocking on the</p>
<p>door people aren&rsquo;t answering she gets to another home</p>
<p>and some lady answers</p>
<p>brings her in and they call the police</p>
<p>the police come out there to</p>
<p>where cynthia was</p>
<p>they take her to the hospital</p>
<p>for her wounds and whatnot for her injuries</p>
<p>and the police are questioning her</p>
<p>questioning her asking like</p>
<p>what happened what was going on</p>
<p>and cynthia told the police</p>
<p>everything she could</p>
<p>first police felt</p>
<p>like there wasn&rsquo;t much</p>
<p>credibility to cynthia&rsquo;s story</p>
<p>she was a sex worker she was also a drug addict and</p>
<p>sadly police</p>
<p>seemed to dismiss</p>
<p>a lot of what they</p>
<p>claim cynthia</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know that</p>
<p>the police aren&rsquo;t really taking her seriously</p>
<p>but she&rsquo;s just telling them</p>
<p>her whole story</p>
<p>while in the hospital talking to police</p>
<p>cynthia looks over</p>
<p>and she sees a lady walk in</p>
<p>and guess who it is</p>
<p>cindy the girl that she just</p>
<p>stabbed in the neck so cindy</p>
<p>starts freaking out she</p>
<p>starts yelling like that&rsquo;s her that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>girlfriend that&rsquo;s her</p>
<p>then police questions cindy</p>
<p>they go down to the home and they end up like</p>
<p>searching the home</p>
<p>so when police officers</p>
<p>go into the home they see like it&rsquo;s a complete mess</p>
<p>they see that there are</p>
<p>chains around the bed also a bucket</p>
<p>where cynthia had told police she was</p>
<p>using this bucket as</p>
<p>the like her bathroom</p>
<p>so when police saw this they knew cynthia wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>lying there were obvious signs of a struggle</p>
<p>there was a</p>
<p>broken lamp on the</p>
<p>floor there were</p>
<p>chains there was the bucket of waste</p>
<p>everything that cynthia had told them</p>
<p>so cindy and</p>
<p>david were both</p>
<p>taken into custody</p>
<p>for questioning</p>
<p>so then police are like</p>
<p>searching the home and then</p>
<p>they go into the backyard and then that&rsquo;s when they see</p>
<p>everything they go into this trailer</p>
<p>and they saw a variety of signs hanging in the toy box</p>
<p>so one was labeled</p>
<p>satan&rsquo;s den</p>
<p>and then another said the lure of</p>
<p>satanism the</p>
<p>final sign is what makes investigators</p>
<p>satanism as</p>
<p>david&rsquo;s motive in all of this</p>
<p>so right next to the</p>
<p>the sign that said</p>
<p>satan&rsquo;s den</p>
<p>was a tall tripod with a very</p>
<p>pricey rca camcorder</p>
<p>pointing towards the</p>
<p>large black</p>
<p>gynecologist&rsquo;s chair</p>
<p>and then inside they find a business like clipboard</p>
<p>it was hanging on the wall</p>
<p>and it looked like a roll call list</p>
<p>of victims he had kidnapped between 1993</p>
<p>and 1997 it had a</p>
<p>ton of dates on this clipboard</p>
<p>for example it said like february 7th 1994</p>
<p>and then next to it it would say</p>
<p>27 and then</p>
<p>underneath that</p>
<p>april 16 1994 33</p>
<p>and then the</p>
<p>list goes on and on and on with tons of dates</p>
<p>and numbers</p>
<p>all the way to like 1997</p>
<p>investigators believe it was a tally</p>
<p>mark showing the number of assaults he had committed</p>
<p>so then there was a bulletin</p>
<p>board which had</p>
<p>photos of his</p>
<p>victims in bondage somewhere gapped hog tied</p>
<p>tied up and looking to be in pain he had polaroid</p>
<p>pictures of them and they were all over all over</p>
<p>also on the bulletin</p>
<p>board was like a big old note of some set</p>
<p>guidelines david</p>
<p>had set for himself or</p>
<p>maybe for others</p>
<p>and it said quote a</p>
<p>woman will do or say anything to get loose</p>
<p>they will kick they will scratch</p>
<p>offer money bite yell</p>
<p>beg scream run</p>
<p>offer sex threaten</p>
<p>lie wait for opportunity</p>
<p>standard excuses and sob stories menstruating pregnant</p>
<p>and then like it just lists a</p>
<p>bunch of excuses</p>
<p>the victims may give</p>
<p>then it goes on to say</p>
<p>quote don&rsquo;t let her get to you</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s worth taking she is</p>
<p>worth keeping and she must be subjected to</p>
<p>hypnosis before the</p>
<p>woman can be safely released</p>
<p>never trust a</p>
<p>chained captive</p>
<p>end quote so then investigators</p>
<p>begin to review</p>
<p>this tape that was in the camcorder they see</p>
<p>david is right beside a lady and she&rsquo;s tied up in this</p>
<p>chair and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>naked and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very obvious to them that the lady in the</p>
<p>chair wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fully awake or</p>
<p>aware she seemed to be really out of it</p>
<p>in and out of consciousness</p>
<p>she did not</p>
<p>up to be of someone who</p>
<p>could give any type of consent as to what was happening</p>
<p>in that moment</p>
<p>then while they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>watching this vhs tape a</p>
<p>voice recording</p>
<p>kicks in you see</p>
<p>david like hit the play button on his</p>
<p>tape player</p>
<p>thing i guess</p>
<p>you see david</p>
<p>would play an</p>
<p>audio tape for his</p>
<p>victims before he</p>
<p>would assault and torture them</p>
<p>this douchebag</p>
<p>he called it a</p>
<p>hypnosis track</p>
<p>the introductory</p>
<p>tape explained that</p>
<p>david was playing a torture game</p>
<p>it was david&rsquo;s</p>
<p>voice explaining how he</p>
<p>would torture them</p>
<p>and what they were</p>
<p>going to endure</p>
<p>so i guess every time he</p>
<p>would bring a new</p>
<p>victim in he</p>
<p>would tie them up to this</p>
<p>chair and then he</p>
<p>would play the tape it reminds me of saw</p>
<p>the movie you know</p>
<p>so also david he described his acts to</p>
<p>be not only for himself but also for the</p>
<p>congregation of the church of</p>
<p>satan you can hear the full</p>
<p>audio recording on youtube</p>
<p>if you are curious i am</p>
<p>not going to play it here for one</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s extremely inappropriate and</p>
<p>absolutely disgusting and disturbing two</p>
<p>40 minutes long okay the dude rambles forever it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>worst he&rsquo;s not very good at hypnosis</p>
<p>i mean i&rsquo;ll give you a little idea</p>
<p>he starts off the recording by saying</p>
<p>hello there</p>
<p>bitch are you comfortable right now</p>
<p>doubt it he then goes on to explain like how he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to stick</p>
<p>things in all of the holes</p>
<p>that the body has a lot of holes and i will</p>
<p>stick all of them throughout the</p>
<p>whole recording he just rambles a lot</p>
<p>of like sexual nonsense</p>
<p>he needs like a</p>
<p>coloring book or something i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>then finally you</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s over and it&rsquo;s like um</p>
<p>nope so there&rsquo;s a side b</p>
<p>to this hypnosis</p>
<p>track it continues it goes on forever</p>
<p>and i didn&rsquo;t feel like no hypnosis</p>
<p>after listening to it okay</p>
<p>anyways it just further</p>
<p>proves that he is a pathetic</p>
<p>piece of human garbage</p>
<p>police are looking at the footage and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to figure out who is this lady in the</p>
<p>chair on this recording</p>
<p>trying to figure out</p>
<p>do you recognize her can anybody recognize this lady</p>
<p>like dude where is she we</p>
<p>wanna speak to her</p>
<p>so they send this footage</p>
<p>over to the fbi</p>
<p>cause i see that she has a large</p>
<p>tattoo on her calf</p>
<p>they send it to the fbi so they can somehow</p>
<p>determine what this</p>
<p>tattoo is and hopefully</p>
<p>lead them to the victim</p>
<p>and how the fbi is able to make out with this</p>
<p>tattoo is is insane to me because the footage is so</p>
<p>grainy but they are somehow able to determine what this</p>
<p>tattoo is now it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>super unique</p>
<p>tattoo it&rsquo;s like squiggly lines or something</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like something simple like a</p>
<p>heart or whatever it&rsquo;s a very unique tattoo</p>
<p>they are somehow able to determine what it is</p>
<p>and then the fbi they post it i&rsquo;m not sure how they get</p>
<p>it out there but they get it out there to the public</p>
<p>somehow and they&rsquo;re saying like hey if this is your</p>
<p>tattoo can you please come forward</p>
<p>we really need to</p>
<p>speak with you</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna be</p>
<p>completely honest i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>fully sure how they put it out there because it got</p>
<p>to this woman</p>
<p>named kelly</p>
<p>kelly was living in</p>
<p>colorado at the time and she&rsquo;s like hey</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my tattoo</p>
<p>kelly goes to</p>
<p>the police department in</p>
<p>truth or consequences</p>
<p>and then they tell her that they have this</p>
<p>videotape so let me tell you now</p>
<p>kelly&rsquo;s story okay</p>
<p>so new story</p>
<p>kelly later testifies july 24th 1996</p>
<p>she and her husband got into an argument</p>
<p>and at this time she was living in elephant butte</p>
<p>so they get into an argument she</p>
<p>leaves the house</p>
<p>and she decided to go out with her</p>
<p>girlfriends and</p>
<p>go play pool and have a couple of</p>
<p>adults beverages</p>
<p>they end up at blue</p>
<p>water saloon it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>local bar where a lot of people</p>
<p>in the neighborhood go they</p>
<p>decide just to hang out there and play pool now while</p>
<p>inside this bar</p>
<p>kelly runs into an old friend her name&rsquo;s</p>
<p>jesse pop quiz</p>
<p>do you remember what david&rsquo;s</p>
<p>daughter&rsquo;s name was</p>
<p>well her name is</p>
<p>jesse jesse is</p>
<p>david&rsquo;s daughter</p>
<p>okay she&rsquo;s hanging out at this bar too so</p>
<p>kelly is saying that she had known</p>
<p>jesse for a couple of years so when</p>
<p>kelly&rsquo;s friends decided to go home</p>
<p>for the night</p>
<p>kelly felt comfortable hanging out with jesse</p>
<p>towards the end of the</p>
<p>night kelly said she was feeling really dizzy</p>
<p>ill she was feeling sick</p>
<p>and she only had one</p>
<p>beer and she needed a ride home</p>
<p>so she asked her friend</p>
<p>jesse hey can you give me can you give me a ride home</p>
<p>and jesse&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>sure kelly says from that</p>
<p>point she does not remember a damn thing</p>
<p>okay nothing</p>
<p>but it is later reported</p>
<p>what exactly happened and it&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>so jesse david&rsquo;s</p>
<p>daughter she drugged the beer that</p>
<p>kelly was drinking</p>
<p>and instead of driving her home she</p>
<p>drove kelly to</p>
<p>david&rsquo;s trailer</p>
<p>once she got there a dog collar was</p>
<p>attached to</p>
<p>kelly and she was locked up in the toy box</p>
<p>kelly awoke</p>
<p>and she blacked out several times during the</p>
<p>two days of</p>
<p>torture and drugging she was being consistently drugged</p>
<p>so he thinks she&rsquo;s dead</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>takes her like the side of the road or something</p>
<p>and he drops her off</p>
<p>kelly and then another man finds her</p>
<p>i know this is confusing</p>
<p>but another man finds</p>
<p>kelly and he ends up actually</p>
<p>taking her home</p>
<p>okay at that time when she was</p>
<p>dropped off by the stranger</p>
<p>kelly&rsquo;s husband believed</p>
<p>she was actually</p>
<p>cheating on him</p>
<p>or had been on a drug binge</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t believe her</p>
<p>story at all she kept saying to her husband</p>
<p>that she didn&rsquo;t remember what happened</p>
<p>she was gone for two days and she just didn&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>and he did not</p>
<p>believe her he</p>
<p>ended up filing for divorce from</p>
<p>kelly and then kelly</p>
<p>moved to colorado</p>
<p>and this was all within like a week time frame</p>
<p>it was very quick</p>
<p>kelly said in an interview</p>
<p>that she kept having</p>
<p>nightmares and</p>
<p>these nightmares were like of her</p>
<p>being held down or restrained and being like raped or</p>
<p>things being inserted in her</p>
<p>and she just thought it was due to like</p>
<p>stress so when</p>
<p>she went to go talk to police</p>
<p>least because of her tattoo</p>
<p>they questioned her asking</p>
<p>if she remembered anything</p>
<p>about being at this</p>
<p>house if she</p>
<p>knew who the guy was</p>
<p>and then police investigators brought up the vhs tape</p>
<p>she said she</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know what they were talking</p>
<p>about right she had no idea</p>
<p>i couldn&rsquo;t even imagine being in her</p>
<p>shoes because police end up</p>
<p>showing her the tape it</p>
<p>eventually led to her</p>
<p>remembering</p>
<p>everything and putting all the</p>
<p>pieces together</p>
<p>which made me so sick to my stomach</p>
<p>because could you imagine</p>
<p>not remembering anything</p>
<p>right and then they show you this tape of you</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re being tortured</p>
<p>and it just couldn&rsquo;t imagine being in</p>
<p>in her shoes like it must be</p>
<p>so the media had gotten a hold of the</p>
<p>story and they were kind of putting it out there</p>
<p>about what was</p>
<p>going on right</p>
<p>and once the</p>
<p>media put it out there then another</p>
<p>victim had come forward and her name was angelica</p>
<p>and she came forward</p>
<p>right after the</p>
<p>abuse originally had</p>
<p>taken place and she had reported it</p>
<p>to police originally</p>
<p>her abuse had</p>
<p>taken place</p>
<p>right before</p>
<p>cynthia the girl we</p>
<p>first talked</p>
<p>about and because</p>
<p>again angelica was a sex worker and a drug abuser</p>
<p>nothing came from it</p>
<p>nothing happened</p>
<p>about it she told</p>
<p>like where the</p>
<p>house was and</p>
<p>everything once the</p>
<p>media had gotten hold of it</p>
<p>angelica went</p>
<p>again to the</p>
<p>police officers and told them like hey the same</p>
<p>thing happened</p>
<p>to me and i had reported it and i just want to</p>
<p>make sure she just did a follow up took notice of her</p>
<p>claims and eventually the investigators</p>
<p>took her claim seriously</p>
<p>investigators talk with</p>
<p>david&rsquo;s livin</p>
<p>girlfriend cindy remember her</p>
<p>friends described cindy</p>
<p>as someone who listened to christian radio</p>
<p>loved romance</p>
<p>novels of her</p>
<p>small dog cindy</p>
<p>said she had</p>
<p>participated in</p>
<p>multiple assaults</p>
<p>and she was willing to give any information on</p>
<p>david in order to get a lesser sentence</p>
<p>right out the gate she was like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll tell you anything you want</p>
<p>cindy told investigators that</p>
<p>david knew he had been tipped off</p>
<p>he had been tipped off to the fbi</p>
<p>because the fbi had come by and they questioned him</p>
<p>on his slavery</p>
<p>ring he reassured cindy</p>
<p>that he talked his way out of it and not to worry</p>
<p>about it she does confirm that</p>
<p>david was selling</p>
<p>women to other sex traffickers</p>
<p>she also said that</p>
<p>david viewed</p>
<p>women in a sense that he owned them</p>
<p>and when talking</p>
<p>about killing his victims</p>
<p>he called them packages</p>
<p>cindy went on to say that david was</p>
<p>crafty little bitch</p>
<p>david was constantly making his own torture devices</p>
<p>and restraints from junk he would find</p>
<p>either at work or</p>
<p>being like thrown out</p>
<p>she claimed that</p>
<p>david took photos of his</p>
<p>victims during torture but</p>
<p>would burn the</p>
<p>photos after a period of time passed</p>
<p>which disappointed</p>
<p>investigators since</p>
<p>this could have been</p>
<p>essential evidence used to</p>
<p>identify possible victims so</p>
<p>based off of her</p>
<p>accounts given</p>
<p>she said that</p>
<p>he killed over 30 people</p>
<p>she explained that david</p>
<p>tried to dump a body into the lake</p>
<p>but it had come back</p>
<p>up so then he</p>
<p>learned to cut open the stomachs so they</p>
<p>would submerge</p>
<p>easily into the lake and like stay down</p>
<p>and then over time he</p>
<p>would cut open</p>
<p>their stomachs and then fill</p>
<p>their stomachs with rocks</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>would tie them back up with like chicken wire</p>
<p>and then throw them into the lake</p>
<p>so then they</p>
<p>would stay down as well</p>
<p>so cindy would go on to say that</p>
<p>david had dropped</p>
<p>about seven</p>
<p>bodies into the lake</p>
<p>so you would</p>
<p>think investigators</p>
<p>would then go</p>
<p>search the lake</p>
<p>right like okay she&rsquo;s saying that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>seven bodies in the lake let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go check no</p>
<p>so investigators said that the</p>
<p>water was too deep or too dark they also thought</p>
<p>about possibly</p>
<p>draining the lake completely</p>
<p>but it was too costly</p>
<p>and it just</p>
<p>never happened so they did nothing instead</p>
<p>so cindy was being</p>
<p>charged with conspiracy to commit kidnapping</p>
<p>accessory to kidnapping accessory to criminal</p>
<p>penetration</p>
<p>she was sentenced to 36 years in prison</p>
<p>and only had to</p>
<p>serve half of her sentence</p>
<p>which was 19 years</p>
<p>and then she was up for release</p>
<p>back in like</p>
<p>2017 i think it was but i</p>
<p>could not find</p>
<p>where is she now i</p>
<p>could not find anything</p>
<p>after that i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if she got out i don&rsquo;t know if she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still in there</p>
<p>i wasn&rsquo;t having much luck finding anything</p>
<p>about her okay</p>
<p>so now glenda jean ray</p>
<p>aka jesse aka</p>
<p>david&rsquo;s daughter</p>
<p>remember her</p>
<p>so she was known</p>
<p>in the area</p>
<p>to be like a drug dealer and she was pretty violent</p>
<p>as well she</p>
<p>lived with her</p>
<p>mother which was one of</p>
<p>david&rsquo;s ex wives</p>
<p>and had a pretty</p>
<p>rocky relationship with her father jesse</p>
<p>would say that she</p>
<p>never knew what was happening to the</p>
<p>women that were brought to the toy box</p>
<p>she just assumed that they</p>
<p>were being raped but didn&rsquo;t participate in the killing</p>
<p>or the rape</p>
<p>later on said that she was the one that called the fbi</p>
<p>and she gave an anonymous tip saying that her father</p>
<p>david was capturing</p>
<p>women sold them</p>
<p>in a slavery ring</p>
<p>david would be</p>
<p>later on questioned</p>
<p>about this anonymous tip that she had</p>
<p>given but nothing came from it</p>
<p>remember kelly</p>
<p>kelly was the one on the</p>
<p>videotape so when</p>
<p>kelly&rsquo;s accusation of jesse</p>
<p>being the one that drugged her</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what led to</p>
<p>jesse&rsquo;s arrest which was</p>
<p>april 26 1999</p>
<p>jesse she ended up being</p>
<p>charged with kidnapping</p>
<p>criminal sexual penetration criminal</p>
<p>sexual contact</p>
<p>and conspiracy</p>
<p>she was released</p>
<p>after only serving two and a half year sentence</p>
<p>and then she was put on probation</p>
<p>for one year</p>
<p>jesse didn&rsquo;t really talk much so i have no idea like</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know if she was involved more she probably was</p>
<p>but she&rsquo;s out now</p>
<p>and if she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>watching this</p>
<p>sorry girl like don&rsquo;t come</p>
<p>after me i didn&rsquo;t do anything i&rsquo;m just reporting the</p>
<p>story okay so</p>
<p>i know this like this is a lot of people and names</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot going on</p>
<p>i believe that there were a lot</p>
<p>more people involved but there seem to be like a big</p>
<p>cover up happening okay the nineteen ninety</p>
<p>three audio the</p>
<p>hypnosis thing</p>
<p>it proposed</p>
<p>he was not acting</p>
<p>alone in the abductions</p>
<p>that there were many</p>
<p>many people helping him out</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hard to find info on it</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to put out like some wild accusations but</p>
<p>it seems like something</p>
<p>super suspicious</p>
<p>was going on</p>
<p>there are tons of theories</p>
<p>people in the community being involved</p>
<p>police officers being involved</p>
<p>kind of seems like a lot of people knew</p>
<p>anyway so back to</p>
<p>david so what the hell happened to</p>
<p>david then well</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>since day one of his arrest</p>
<p>he denied and i denied</p>
<p>david stated that they were all prostitutes okay</p>
<p>he was paying them it was consensual</p>
<p>there was absolutely</p>
<p>no raping and killing happening and they had no</p>
<p>proof that there was raping and killing happening</p>
<p>because it was all consensual</p>
<p>he showed absolutely no remorse</p>
<p>and he stated that he was the</p>
<p>victim here</p>
<p>that these people are making</p>
<p>crazy accusations and how dare they make</p>
<p>these accusations</p>
<p>so the courts can only</p>
<p>really charged him with</p>
<p>three cases although the fbi suspected</p>
<p>at least 40</p>
<p>more unknown victims</p>
<p>based off of</p>
<p>david&rsquo;s journal</p>
<p>which documented the date of the alleged</p>
<p>abductions he also</p>
<p>tracked in this</p>
<p>journal every</p>
<p>victim and per</p>
<p>seizures performed on them all in</p>
<p>david&rsquo;s handwriting</p>
<p>despite not having any</p>
<p>bodies to use as evidence against</p>
<p>david in the</p>
<p>trial the fbi</p>
<p>felt they had a very</p>
<p>strong case and</p>
<p>also the ability of</p>
<p>david to purchase design install</p>
<p>and use such</p>
<p>devices on people is</p>
<p>proof of both premeditation</p>
<p>and lack of insanity</p>
<p>so then in 2001 the</p>
<p>courts decided to put him through</p>
<p>three separate</p>
<p>trials one for each of the</p>
<p>the living victims so remember cynthia</p>
<p>angelica and kelly</p>
<p>sadly the trial for</p>
<p>angelica it</p>
<p>never was brought forward</p>
<p>because she had passed from</p>
<p>a drug overdose</p>
<p>sadly david eventually</p>
<p>agreed to a plea</p>
<p>deal and received</p>
<p>224 year prison sentence</p>
<p>in exchange for his daughter</p>
<p>jesse to receive a reduced</p>
<p>sentence i mean she only served two and a half years so</p>
<p>it was quite reduced</p>
<p>even though he was only tried for</p>
<p>three murders investigators believe that he</p>
<p>raped tortured and killed over 60</p>
<p>women over the course of his life they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never been able to locate any of</p>
<p>their remains most of</p>
<p>the evidence</p>
<p>of the high body</p>
<p>count comes from the diary</p>
<p>david had kept that detailed what he did to each</p>
<p>victim but it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>where he buried</p>
<p>their bodies</p>
<p>after his arrest</p>
<p>david agreed to show authorities</p>
<p>where he had buried his</p>
<p>victims on may 28th</p>
<p>2002 conveniently</p>
<p>okay david parker ray</p>
<p>the toy box killer suffered a massive</p>
<p>heart attack and he died at the</p>
<p>age of 62 yeah</p>
<p>if it were not for cynthia</p>
<p>escaping and uncovering what was going on</p>
<p>who knows how long it</p>
<p>would have been</p>
<p>until anybody</p>
<p>would have discovered like what he was doing in there</p>
<p>so some who</p>
<p>have followed the case for a long ass time okay</p>
<p>they suspect</p>
<p>unknown victims</p>
<p>of david may lie</p>
<p>unacknowledged</p>
<p>under the new mexico</p>
<p>sands the reservoir</p>
<p>and the waterways</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>land out there a lot of dirt a lot of nothing so people</p>
<p>could really be anywhere also they</p>
<p>could just be in the damn lake that nobody&rsquo;s wanted to</p>
<p>search david was responsible for the</p>
<p>deaths of anywhere between 14 to 60 people he</p>
<p>claims to have killed at</p>
<p>least one person per year</p>
<p>since like the</p>
<p>age of 14 we will</p>
<p>never know for sure</p>
<p>david being now dead</p>
<p>no bodies were</p>
<p>found no possible</p>
<p>victims were</p>
<p>identified and no old</p>
<p>suspicious deaths related to</p>
<p>david were ever officially linked to him</p>
<p>november of 2002 the toy box was open</p>
<p>to the public</p>
<p>with the hope that it would</p>
<p>lead to more</p>
<p>surviving victims coming forward</p>
<p>it kind of more turned into like a tourist attraction</p>
<p>kind of a dumb idea but</p>
<p>who do i know you know</p>
<p>shut up bailey so in</p>
<p>october of two thousand</p>
<p>eleven the fbi performed a</p>
<p>search of the mcrae canyon</p>
<p>which is near elephant butte</p>
<p>lake looking for potential</p>
<p>victims but</p>
<p>they found none</p>
<p>if only they</p>
<p>would just look in that damn lake</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the story of the toy box killer it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>weird one because there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>proof technically that he killed people</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all like</p>
<p>based off of</p>
<p>david&rsquo;s diary his little notebook that they</p>
<p>found inside of the toy box but there was no</p>
<p>bodies found</p>
<p>so they don&rsquo;t know like</p>
<p>maybe he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>lying or something we don&rsquo;t really know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>super gross</p>
<p>he was a very</p>
<p>very sick man</p>
<p>i apologize i know this one was a little like</p>
<p>heavy i mean they all kind of are</p>
<p>oh my gosh you guys really</p>
<p>quick when i was</p>
<p>watching documentaries and stuff</p>
<p>about this guy</p>
<p>the comment sections were terrifying</p>
