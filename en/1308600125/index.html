    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are discussing breathing.</p>
<p>Now, breathing is something that we are all familiar with</p>
<p>because, frankly, we are all doing it right now,</p>
<p>and we do it during our waking states</p>
<p>and while we are asleep.</p>
<p>And most of us have probably heard</p>
<p>that breathing is essential to life.</p>
<p>We hear that we can survive without food</p>
<p>for some period of time,</p>
<p>maybe even up to a month or more,</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t survive that long without water,</p>
<p>but we could survive a few days without water,</p>
<p>depending on how well hydrated we are</p>
<p>when we go into that water deprivation</p>
<p>and the heat of the environment we happen to be in,</p>
<p>but that we cannot survive without breathing</p>
<p>for more than a few minutes,</p>
<p>and that if we cease to breathe,</p>
<p>that our brain and our bodily tissues will die.</p>
<p>And in fact, that is true.</p>
<p>However, despite everybody&rsquo;s knowledge</p>
<p>that breathing is essential to life,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that most people realize</p>
<p>just how important how we breathe is to our quality of life.</p>
<p>And that includes our mental health,</p>
<p>our physical health, and what we call performance.</p>
<p>That is our ability to tap into skills,</p>
<p>either physical or cognitive,</p>
<p>in ways that we would not be able to otherwise</p>
<p>if we are not breathing correctly.</p>
<p>So today we are going to talk about</p>
<p>what it is to breathe correctly,</p>
<p>both at rest, during sleep,</p>
<p>in order to reduce our levels of stress,</p>
<p>in order to wake up or to become more alert deliberately,</p>
<p>and many, many other things,</p>
<p>including how to stop hiccuping.</p>
<p>This is one of the most searched for topics on the internet.</p>
<p>Today, I will teach you the one method</p>
<p>that is actually linked to science.</p>
<p>No, it does not involve drinking a glass of water backwards</p>
<p>from the opposite side of the cup</p>
<p>or holding your breath in any kind of esoteric way.</p>
<p>It actually relates to the neural mechanisms,</p>
<p>that is the brain to body connections,</p>
<p>that cause the hiccup.</p>
<p>Hiccup is a spasm of that neural circuit,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll teach you how to turn off that neural circuit</p>
<p>in one try.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not a technique I developed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a technique that&rsquo;s actually been known about</p>
<p>for several centuries,</p>
<p>and we now know the underlying mechanism.</p>
<p>So today&rsquo;s discussion will give to you many tools</p>
<p>that you can apply.</p>
<p>All of these tools are, of course, behavioral tools.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re completely zero cost.</p>
<p>And in telling you how those tools work,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll learn a lot about how the breathing,</p>
<p>AKA the respiratory system, works</p>
<p>and how it interfaces with the other organs</p>
<p>and tissues of the body, in particular, the brain.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the most important things</p>
<p>to understand about breathing right here at the outset</p>
<p>is that breathing is unique among brain and bodily functions</p>
<p>in that it lies at the interface between our conscious</p>
<p>and our subconscious behavior,</p>
<p>and it represents a bridge, literally, in the brain</p>
<p>between the conscious and the subconscious.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, breathing does not require</p>
<p>that we pay attention to our breathing</p>
<p>or that we are even aware that we are breathing.</p>
<p>It will just carry on in the background,</p>
<p>either normally or abnormally,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll teach you what normal and abnormal breathing is</p>
<p>in a little bit.</p>
<p>However, breathing is unique among brain</p>
<p>and bodily functions in that at any moment,</p>
<p>we can consciously take control of how we breathe.</p>
<p>This is an absolutely spectacular</p>
<p>and highly unusual feature of brain function.</p>
<p>For instance, your digestion is carrying on</p>
<p>in the background right now,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;ve had food recently or not,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t simply control your digestion</p>
<p>by thinking about it in a particular way.</p>
<p>In fact, most people can&rsquo;t even control their thinking</p>
<p>by trying to control their thinking.</p>
<p>That actually takes some practice.</p>
<p>It can be done, a topic for a future episode.</p>
<p>However, breathing is unique.</p>
<p>Breathing will carry on involuntarily, subconsciously</p>
<p>in the background, as I said before,</p>
<p>but if at any moment you want to hold your breath</p>
<p>or inhale more deeply or vigorously</p>
<p>or exhale longer than you inhale, you can do that.</p>
<p>Very few, if any other neural circuits in your brain</p>
<p>and body allow that level of control.</p>
<p>It turns out that level of control is not an accident.</p>
<p>It has been hypothesized that by controlling breathing,</p>
<p>the brain is actually attempting to control</p>
<p>its own state of mind.</p>
<p>Now, the way this was originally stated</p>
<p>in a scientific research paper was a little bit different.</p>
<p>It was a little bit more physiological.</p>
<p>The statement was the brain by regulating breathing</p>
<p>controls its own excitability.</p>
<p>Excitability in the context of neurobiology</p>
<p>is how able the brain is to take in new information or not,</p>
<p>how able the brain is or not to turn itself off,</p>
<p>to go to sleep and to regulate its own levels</p>
<p>of anxiety, focus, et cetera.</p>
<p>If that seems a little bit abstract,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make it simple for you.</p>
<p>By changing your pattern of breathing,</p>
<p>you can very quickly change</p>
<p>what your brain is capable of doing.</p>
<p>In fact, a little bit later,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you that while you inhale,</p>
<p>you are far better at learning and remembering information</p>
<p>than during an exhale,</p>
<p>and it is a very significant difference.</p>
<p>Does that mean you should only inhale and not exhale?</p>
<p>No, of course not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll teach you how to breathe</p>
<p>for the sake of learning and memory,</p>
<p>as well as for physical performance</p>
<p>and a number of other things.</p>
<p>So hopefully I&rsquo;ve been able to highlight for you</p>
<p>the importance of breathing, not just for life,</p>
<p>because yes, breathing is essential for life,</p>
<p>but that the subtleties of how we breathe,</p>
<p>the duration and intensity of our inhales and our exhales,</p>
<p>how long we hold our breath between inhales and exhales,</p>
<p>very critically defines our state of mind</p>
<p>and our state of body,</p>
<p>what we are able to do and what we are not able to do.</p>
<p>And the great news is we can control our breathing</p>
<p>and in doing so control our mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate from my teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is HVMN.</p>
<p>HVMN, which is a supplement that increases ketones,</p>
<p>can be used in the context of a ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>However, many people, including myself,</p>
<p>find that increasing blood ketones</p>
<p>by using a supplement such as HVMN</p>
<p>can greatly improve cognitive ability and physical output</p>
<p>for mental work and for exercise,</p>
<p>even when not on a ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of research supporting the fact</p>
<p>that even if you are consuming carbohydrates</p>
<p>and you are not in ketosis,</p>
<p>that is you are not following a ketogenic diet,</p>
<p>consuming supplements that can increase blood ketones</p>
<p>can allow you to think more clearly for cognitive work</p>
<p>and physical work for that matter,</p>
<p>perform at greater output for things like</p>
<p>resistance training and endurance exercise.</p>
<p>And indeed, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve found.</p>
<p>So I use it largely for preparing for podcasts</p>
<p>or other aspects of my scientific work.</p>
<p>And sometimes prior to workouts,</p>
<p>especially if I&rsquo;m working out</p>
<p>having not consumed any food prior,</p>
<p>I find that I have a lot more energy.</p>
<p>It also has the property of suppressing hunger.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes custom nootropics.</p>
<p>And as many of you have probably heard me say before,</p>
<p>I am not a fan of the word nootropics</p>
<p>because nootropics means smart drugs.</p>
<p>And frankly, the brain doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p>
<p>The brain has neural circuits for focus.</p>
<p>It also has neural circuits for creativity</p>
<p>and neural circuits for task switching</p>
<p>and for imagination and for memory.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a neural circuit for being smart.</p>
<p>And therefore the word nootropics</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really apply to anything specific</p>
<p>neurobiologically speaking.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this</p>
<p>and therefore has designed custom nootropics</p>
<p>that are tailored to your unique needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for over a year now</p>
<p>and their nootropic formulas</p>
<p>have been a game changer for me,</p>
<p>in particular in the realm of cognitive work.</p>
<p>My go-to formula for when I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>any kind of cognitive work is their clarity formula.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one I&rsquo;ve been using most often lately.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Thesis customized nootropics,</p>
<p>you can go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll take a brief three minute quiz</p>

<p>on their scientific advisory council</p>
<p>to help Woop evolve their mission</p>
<p>to improve the way that people are sleeping</p>
<p>and thereby to improve their levels of focus,</p>
<p>mood and alertness and performance</p>
<p>in all endeavors during the day.</p>
<p>As a Woop user, I&rsquo;ve experienced the health benefits,</p>
<p>the focus benefits,</p>
<p>essentially all of the major benefits</p>
<p>that come with getting an excellent night&rsquo;s sleep</p>
<p>on a consistent basis.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also learned from using my Woop</p>
<p>how certain daily activities like the timing of exercise,</p>
<p>caffeine and a number of other things</p>
<p>impact the depth, quality and duration of my sleep.</p>
<p>Woop is one of those tools that can really help guide you</p>
<p>and provide you with personalized data,</p>
<p>recommendations and coaching around your body</p>
<p>and your overall health.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about breathing.</p>
<p>And of course we breathe in order to bring oxygen</p>
<p>into the body,</p>
<p>but we also breathe to remove certain things from our body,</p>
<p>in particular carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>So the main players in today&rsquo;s discussion</p>
<p>are going to be oxygen and carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>Now, a common misconception is that oxygen is good</p>
<p>and carbon dioxide is bad.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s simply not the case.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just take a step back from that statement</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s think about this.</p>
<p>When we breathe in, we are largely breathing in air</p>
<p>in order to bring oxygen into our body.</p>
<p>And we can just stop right there and say,</p>
<p>why do we breathe at all?</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t we just get oxygen from the world around us?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s because oxygen can&rsquo;t diffuse through our skin</p>
<p>into the deeper cells of our body.</p>
<p>Other single cell and very simple organisms</p>
<p>can actually bring oxygen into their system</p>
<p>without the need to breathe.</p>
<p>But we have to breathe in order to bring oxygen</p>
<p>to the cells that reside deep in our body.</p>
<p>In particular, our brain cells,</p>
<p>which are the most metabolically active cells in our body</p>
<p>require a lot of oxygen.</p>
<p>And those brain cells are sitting, of course, in the brain,</p>
<p>which is encased in the cranial vault, the skull.</p>
<p>And so oxygens can&rsquo;t simply pass to those cells.</p>
<p>So we need to have a system</p>
<p>that will deliver oxygen to those cells.</p>
<p>We also need a system,</p>
<p>which turns out to be the breathing or respiratory system</p>
<p>that can offload or remove the gas</p>
<p>that we call carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>Not because carbon dioxide is bad,</p>
<p>but because too much of it in our system is not good.</p>
<p>In fact, much of today&rsquo;s discussion</p>
<p>will also center around the common misconception</p>
<p>that carbon dioxide is something that we want to get rid of.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to get rid of too much carbon dioxide</p>
<p>or else you can&rsquo;t actually get oxygen</p>
<p>to the cells and tissues of your body in an efficient way.</p>
<p>So you need oxygen and you need carbon dioxide in your body.</p>
<p>You also need to be able to offload or remove carbon dioxide</p>
<p>and bring in oxygen in the correct ratios</p>
<p>so that you can perform the kind of mental functions</p>
<p>and physical functions that you want to.</p>
<p>So if we just dial out even further,</p>
<p>we say, what are the key components of breathing?</p>
<p>What are the elements within the body</p>
<p>that allow us to bring oxygen to the tissues and cells</p>
<p>as is required and remove carbon dioxide from the body</p>
<p>as is required and yet keep enough carbon dioxide around</p>
<p>in order to allow oxygen to do its thing?</p>
<p>Well, that breathing or respiratory apparatus</p>
<p>has two major components.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to just briefly describe those.</p>
<p>And as I do this, I really want to highlight the fact</p>
<p>that anytime you&rsquo;re thinking about biology</p>
<p>and physiology in particular,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s about the brain or the liver</p>
<p>or the gut microbiome,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s useful to categorize things</p>
<p>either as mechanical mechanisms or chemical mechanisms.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s just take the analogy of hunger.</p>
<p>There are mechanical mechanisms</p>
<p>that tell us when we should eat.</p>
<p>For instance, you have neurons, nerve cells in your gut</p>
<p>that signal how stretched or non-stretched</p>
<p>the walls of your stomach are, right?</p>
<p>How full or how empty your gut is</p>
<p>and send that information to the brain</p>
<p>to make you feel to some extent hungry or not hungry.</p>
<p>In general, when our stomach is very full,</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s very distended, even with liquid,</p>
<p>it suppresses our hunger.</p>
<p>Whereas when our stomach is devoid</p>
<p>of that mechanical pressure,</p>
<p>especially for a number of hours,</p>
<p>it tends to trigger hunger by signaling</p>
<p>via neurons to the brain.</p>
<p>In addition, there are chemical signals</p>
<p>that go from the gut to the brain.</p>
<p>For instance, we have neurons in our gut</p>
<p>that can detect the presence of amino acids</p>
<p>from proteins that we eat,</p>
<p>fatty acids from the foods that we eat, the lipids,</p>
<p>and sugars, different forms of carbohydrate.</p>
<p>The neurons in our gut are paying attention to</p>
<p>or respond to how much amino acid,</p>
<p>fatty acid, and carbohydrate is in our gut</p>
<p>and send signals to the brain</p>
<p>to either stimulate or suppress hunger.</p>
<p>So those are chemical signals</p>
<p>that are being passed from gut to brain</p>
<p>and they work in parallel with the mechanical signals.</p>
<p>And this idea of in parallel with,</p>
<p>again, is a very common theme in biology,</p>
<p>especially neuroscience.</p>
<p>The term parallel pathways refers to the fact that</p>
<p>anytime there&rsquo;s a critical bodily function,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very unlikely that just one type of information,</p>
<p>like just mechanical information, is going to be used.</p>
<p>Almost always, it&rsquo;s going to be mechanical</p>
<p>and chemical information.</p>
<p>I could pick a number of other examples.</p>
<p>For instance, if you want to avoid damaging your skin</p>
<p>or other tissues of your body, which is essential to life,</p>
<p>well, then you have mechanical information about,</p>
<p>for instance, whether or not something is pinching</p>
<p>or ready to pierce your skin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s mechanical information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sent via specific neurons up to the brain</p>
<p>to signal a retraction reflex.</p>
<p>If you move your limb away</p>
<p>from wherever that intense pressure is coming.</p>
<p>You also have chemical sensing in your skin,</p>
<p>the presence of things that elicit a burn</p>
<p>or that elicit itch or that elicit extreme cold.</p>
<p>All of that chemical information</p>
<p>is being signaled up to the brain as well in parallel.</p>
<p>So parallel pathways is a common theme.</p>
<p>So when we&rsquo;re thinking about the respiration,</p>
<p>aka the breathing system,</p>
<p>we also need to look at the mechanical system.</p>
<p>What are the different components of the nose,</p>
<p>the mouth, the lungs, et cetera,</p>
<p>that allow oxygen to be brought in</p>
<p>and carbon dioxide to be removed from the body,</p>
<p>but not too much carbon dioxide removed</p>
<p>to allow breathing to work as efficiently</p>
<p>and as optimally as possible.</p>
<p>And then we also need to look at the chemical systems</p>
<p>of the lungs, the bloodstream,</p>
<p>and how different cells use oxygen and carbon dioxide</p>
<p>in order to understand that as well.</p>
<p>If you can understand the mechanical</p>
<p>and chemical aspects of breathing,</p>
<p>even just at a top contour,</p>
<p>well, then the various tools that I discussed</p>
<p>during today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>such as the ability to calm yourself down most quickly</p>
<p>by doing what&rsquo;s called a physiological sigh.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go into this in more detail in a little bit,</p>
<p>but this is two very deep inhales through the nose.</p>
<p>So the first one is a long inhale.</p>
<p>And then the second one after that is a quick sharp inhale</p>
<p>to maximally inflate your lungs,</p>
<p>followed by a full exhale through the mouth</p>
<p>to lungs completely empty.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s big inhale through the nose,</p>
<p>then short inhale through the nose immediately after that</p>
<p>in order to maximally inflate the lungs.</p>
<p>And then a long exhale through the mouth</p>
<p>until your lungs are empty.</p>
<p>You will understand why that particular pattern</p>
<p>of breathing and not simply one inhale</p>
<p>or not simply an inhale through the nose</p>
<p>and an exhale through the nose as well</p>
<p>is optimal for reducing your stress quickly.</p>
<p>That double inhale through the nose</p>
<p>followed by a long exhale through the mouth</p>
<p>works to reduce your levels of stress</p>
<p>and lower your levels of so-called autonomic arousal</p>
<p>very fast in real time.</p>
<p>And it works better than any other known approach.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a hack.</p>
<p>This is actually something that your body</p>
<p>has specific neural circuits to do.</p>
<p>And it actually performs during sleep on a regular basis</p>
<p>and even throughout the day.</p>
<p>And that you can perform voluntarily.</p>
<p>And it works so well to reduce stress very quickly,</p>
<p>not because it brings in the maximum amount of oxygen</p>
<p>and removes the maximum amount of carbon dioxide,</p>
<p>but rather because it optimally balances</p>
<p>oxygen and carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>If you understand the mechanical</p>
<p>and chemical aspects of breathing,</p>
<p>then you will understand exactly why</p>
<p>that particular pattern of breathing,</p>
<p>the so-called physiological sigh,</p>
<p>is the most efficient way to rapidly reduce stress</p>
<p>in real time.</p>
<p>If you can understand the mechanical</p>
<p>and chemical aspects of breathing,</p>
<p>you will also understand why most people are over-breathing,</p>
<p>that is they&rsquo;re breathing too often,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re breathing in a shallow manner,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re breathing too often,</p>
<p>and they are blowing off or removing</p>
<p>too much carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>And if you understand that carbon dioxide</p>
<p>is critical for the way that oxygen is delivered</p>
<p>from the bloodstream to the tissues of the body,</p>
<p>including the brain,</p>
<p>well, then it will make very good sense</p>
<p>as to why people who are breathing too much</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t actually experience all the effects</p>
<p>of elevated oxygen,</p>
<p>but rather they&rsquo;re putting their body</p>
<p>into what&rsquo;s called a hypoxic state.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not getting enough oxygen</p>
<p>to the tissues of their body, in particular, their brain.</p>
<p>And this is true, not just for people who are obese</p>
<p>or who suffer from sleep apnea,</p>
<p>or although that&rsquo;s certainly the case,</p>
<p>but for people that have, believe it or not,</p>
<p>certain personality types.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about breathing and personality type</p>
<p>and actually how breathing has been shown</p>
<p>to alter personality.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, breathing can alter personality</p>
<p>in positive ways that allow anyone</p>
<p>to show up to the various social</p>
<p>and non-social endeavors of their life</p>
<p>with more calm, more focus, alertness,</p>
<p>and improve their overall health.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s talk about</p>
<p>the mechanical components of breathing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really quite simple.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got your nose, obviously,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got your mouth.</p>
<p>And a little bit later,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk about the incredible advantages</p>
<p>of being a nasal breather most of the time,</p>
<p>but also the incredible advantages</p>
<p>of using your mouth to breathe,</p>
<p>both for inhales and exhales</p>
<p>during particular types of endeavors.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll get back to that a little later.</p>
<p>But for the meantime,</p>
<p>the only two ways to bring air into your system</p>
<p>are through your nose and through your mouth.</p>
<p>We also have the larynx,</p>
<p>which is a rigid tissue or pipe</p>
<p>that brings the air from the nose and mouth</p>
<p>down to the lungs.</p>
<p>Now, that word rigid is really important here</p>
<p>because what we will soon learn</p>
<p>is that your lungs basically act like a pump.</p>
<p>You sort of know this already,</p>
<p>but these are two big bags, basically,</p>
<p>that can fill with air or that can squeeze air out.</p>
<p>Now, what most people don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>is that the lungs are not just two big bags of air.</p>
<p>Your lungs are actually two big bags of air</p>
<p>that inside of them have hundreds of millions</p>
<p>of little sacs that are called the avioli of the lungs.</p>
<p>And by having those hundreds of millions of little sacs,</p>
<p>you increase the surface area of the lungs.</p>
<p>And by increasing the surface area,</p>
<p>you allow more oxygen to pass from the air in your lungs</p>
<p>into the bloodstream than if you didn&rsquo;t have those sacs.</p>
<p>And you allow more carbon dioxide</p>
<p>to move from the bloodstream into those sacs of the lungs.</p>
<p>And then when you exhale,</p>
<p>the carbon dioxide can be removed.</p>
<p>Okay, so those little sacs we call avioli of the lungs</p>
<p>are an important part of the mechanical aspect of breathing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get to a little bit later.</p>
<p>Okay, so at a first pass,</p>
<p>the mechanical aspects of breathing</p>
<p>are really straightforward, right?</p>
<p>You can breathe through your nose,</p>
<p>you can breathe through your mouth,</p>
<p>goes down through the larynx.</p>
<p>I told you the larynx is a rigid pipe.</p>
<p>The lungs are not rigid.</p>
<p>They can expand and they can contract like a pump</p>
<p>to bring in air or to expel air.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the lungs</p>
<p>do not have any muscles themselves.</p>
<p>So we need muscles that can either squeeze the lungs</p>
<p>or that will allow the lungs to expand.</p>
<p>And there are two general groups of muscles that do that.</p>
<p>And they are the diaphragm</p>
<p>and the so-called intercostal muscles.</p>
<p>The diaphragm is a thin muscle</p>
<p>that sits below the lungs and above the liver.</p>
<p>And when we inhale,</p>
<p>provided that we are using</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called diaphragmatic breathing,</p>
<p>that diaphragm contracts.</p>
<p>And when it contracts, it moves down,</p>
<p>which allows more space for the lungs to inflate with air.</p>
<p>Now, the intercostal muscles</p>
<p>are the muscles between our ribs.</p>
<p>A number of people probably don&rsquo;t realize this,</p>
<p>but your ribs, of course, are bone,</p>
<p>but in between those bones, you have muscles.</p>
<p>And the intercostal muscles, when you inhale, contract,</p>
<p>and that allows your rib cage to move up</p>
<p>and to expand a bit.</p>
<p>Now, I think, again,</p>
<p>people probably don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>that your ribs are not fixed in place.</p>
<p>They can actually get further</p>
<p>and closer apart from one another.</p>
<p>So when you inhale, your rib cage actually moves up.</p>
<p>Sometimes the shoulders will move up as well.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because those intercostal muscles</p>
<p>are contracting.</p>
<p>Now, muscles can&rsquo;t move on their own.</p>
<p>They are controlled by nerves.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got the nose, the mouth, the larynx, and the lungs.</p>
<p>The lungs have all those little alveoli in them.</p>
<p>And as I told you, we&rsquo;ve got the diaphragm</p>
<p>as a muscle to move the lungs,</p>
<p>and we have the intercostal muscles to move the ribs,</p>
<p>which can allow the lungs to expand.</p>
<p>Again, we&rsquo;re just on the mechanical components of breathing.</p>
<p>But because muscles can&rsquo;t move themselves,</p>
<p>you should be asking what moves the muscles.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really nerves that control muscles.</p>
<p>So whether or not you&rsquo;re contracting your biceps</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re walking and you&rsquo;re contracting your quadriceps</p>
<p>and your hamstrings and your calf muscles,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s neurons, nerve cells that control that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a specialized nerve called the phrenic nerve,</p>
<p>P-H-R-E-N-I-C, phrenic nerve that comes out of the neck.</p>
<p>And when I say it comes out of the neck,</p>
<p>what I mean is that they&rsquo;re little neurons</p>
<p>that reside in the brainstem, in the back of your brain.</p>
<p>And they send little wires that we call axons</p>
<p>down and out of the neck.</p>
<p>They go close to the heart and a little bit behind it,</p>
<p>and they go down and they form synapses.</p>
<p>That is, they form connections with the diaphragm.</p>
<p>And when those neurons release neurotransmitter,</p>
<p>which are little chemicals,</p>
<p>the diaphragm contracts and it moves down.</p>
<p>So we say that the phrenic nerve is a motor nerve.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s designed to move muscle.</p>
<p>However, the phrenic nerve,</p>
<p>like a few other nerves in the body,</p>
<p>is interesting in that it has not just motor nerves</p>
<p>in there, neurons that control the contraction of muscles,</p>
<p>it also can sense things.</p>
<p>There has sensory neurons.</p>
<p>So it also sends connections down to the diaphragm</p>
<p>and actually down deep into the diaphragm</p>
<p>and close to the liver.</p>
<p>And note that I said liver twice now already,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to get back to this later</p>
<p>when we talk about physical movement and cramps of the body.</p>
<p>Those sensory neurons dive deep into the diaphragm,</p>
<p>and then they go back up to the brain,</p>
<p>and they allow you to sense where the diaphragm is.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re giving information</p>
<p>about where the diaphragm is in your body.</p>
<p>Now, most of the time you&rsquo;re not paying attention to this,</p>
<p>but right now you can actually try this,</p>
<p>and I would encourage you to do this.</p>
<p>Diaphragmatic breathing is in many ways</p>
<p>the ideal way to breathe</p>
<p>in that it&rsquo;s the most efficient way to breathe.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about what we mean exactly</p>
<p>when we say breathing efficiency later.</p>
<p>But the diaphragm is designed to allow the lungs to expand</p>
<p>or to contract the lungs to bring air into the body</p>
<p>or to remove carbon dioxide from the body.</p>
<p>And if you want to know</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re using diaphragmatic breathing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very simple.</p>
<p>If you inhale, probably best to do this through the nose,</p>
<p>but you could do it through the mouth.</p>
<p>If you inhale and your belly moves outward on the inhale,</p>
<p>well, then that phrenic nerve</p>
<p>is controlling your diaphragm properly.</p>
<p>And then when you exhale,</p>
<p>your belly should go in just a little bit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s diaphragmatic breathing.</p>
<p>Now, diaphragmatic breathing is talked about</p>
<p>in the context of yoga.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s often talked about as a way to calm down and so on,</p>
<p>but diaphragmatic breathing is just one mode</p>
<p>by which your brain and the phrenic nerve</p>
<p>can control muscle, the diaphragm,</p>
<p>to control the mechanical aspects of the lungs</p>
<p>to bring in air and expel air.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before,</p>
<p>you also have these muscles between your ribs</p>
<p>or the intracostal muscles.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a separate set of nerves</p>
<p>that allow those muscles to contract</p>
<p>and for your rib cage to expand</p>
<p>in order to create more room for your lungs</p>
<p>to get larger and fill with air</p>
<p>or for your rib cage to contract a bit</p>
<p>when those muscles relax in order to expel air.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to go on record by saying that</p>
<p>there is no rule that diaphragmatic breathing is better</p>
<p>than breathing where your rib cage moves.</p>
<p>This is a common misconception.</p>
<p>People say, oh, you know,</p>
<p>if your shoulders are going up and down</p>
<p>and your rib cage is moving while you&rsquo;re breathing,</p>
<p>well, then you&rsquo;re not breathing right.</p>
<p>And if your belly goes out</p>
<p>and the rest of your body is still while you breathe,</p>
<p>well, then you&rsquo;re breathing correctly.</p>
<p>I know of zero, in fact, zero minus one data</p>
<p>to support that statement.</p>
<p>You have multiple parallel mechanisms</p>
<p>to control the mechanics of your lungs and for breathing.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re exerting yourself very hard,</p>
<p>you tend to use both the intracostal muscles</p>
<p>and your rib cage moving,</p>
<p>as well as your diaphragm</p>
<p>in order to bring in a lot of oxygen</p>
<p>and to offload a lot of carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re calmer, frankly,</p>
<p>you could use diaphragmatic breathing</p>
<p>or you could use rib cage type breathing</p>
<p>in order to bring enough oxygen into your system.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no real data showing</p>
<p>that diaphragmatic breathing is somehow better or worse.</p>
<p>However, being able to mechanically control</p>
<p>those independently or to combine them</p>
<p>and use them together is of tremendous power</p>
<p>toward regulating your mental and physical states.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about how to do that a little bit later.</p>
<p>For right now, please understand</p>
<p>that you have these different mechanical components</p>
<p>that allow you to bring oxygen into your system</p>
<p>and to expel air</p>
<p>and to thereby offload carbon dioxide from your system.</p>
<p>Again, we haven&rsquo;t talked about the gas exchange</p>
<p>of carbon dioxide and oxygen</p>
<p>and how that&rsquo;s happening in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about that next.</p>
<p>But the basic mechanical components are pretty simple.</p>
<p>Once again, just to review, it&rsquo;s nose, mouth, larynx, lungs,</p>
<p>alveoli within the lungs, and then those two muscles,</p>
<p>the diaphragm and the intracostal muscles of the ribs.</p>
<p>And one thing I failed to mention</p>
<p>is why it&rsquo;s so important that that larynx be rigid,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a tube that is very rigid.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is that unlike the lungs,</p>
<p>which you want to act as sort of a bellow pump</p>
<p>where you can deflate it and inflate it</p>
<p>in order to move air in and out,</p>
<p>the larynx needs to be rigid so that it doesn&rsquo;t collapse</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re bringing air in and out.</p>
<p>You can imagine that if it was a very flimsy tube</p>
<p>or the walls of the larynx were very flimsy and thin,</p>
<p>well, then you can imagine breathing in very vigorously</p>
<p>and it would shut like a tube</p>
<p>that suddenly flattens on itself, which would not be good.</p>
<p>So the fact that the larynx is rigid</p>
<p>is actually a very crucial part of this whole system.</p>
<p>The other important aspect of this system</p>
<p>as it relates to the mechanics of breathing</p>
<p>is the fact that your nose and your mouth</p>
<p>have different resistances to air.</p>
<p>You can probably notice this right now</p>
<p>if you were to, for instance, breathe in through your mouth</p>
<p>and only through your mouth</p>
<p>versus breathe in through your nose.</p>
<p>Some of you perhaps have a harder time</p>
<p>breathing in through your nose.</p>
<p>By the way, it&rsquo;s perfectly normal</p>
<p>that one or the other nostril</p>
<p>would be harder to breathe through</p>
<p>or easier to breathe through</p>
<p>and that that switches across the day.</p>
<p>It has to do with the flow of mucus</p>
<p>and cerebrospinal fluid and intracranial pressure,</p>
<p>totally normal.</p>
<p>Many people out there think they have a deviated septum</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t actually have a deviated septum.</p>
<p>A little bit later, we&rsquo;ll talk about</p>
<p>how to repair a deviated septum without surgery</p>
<p>because that actually is possible in many, not all cases</p>
<p>and is immensely beneficial to do.</p>
<p>But what we know is that breathing in through the nose</p>
<p>is a little bit harder</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s supposed to be a little bit harder.</p>
<p>However, because it&rsquo;s a little bit harder,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s more resistance, as we say,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually able to draw more force</p>
<p>into these mechanical aspects of the breathing apparatus</p>
<p>and actually bring more air into your lungs.</p>
<p>You can try this right now.</p>
<p>Try breathing in through your mouth</p>
<p>to maximally inflate your lungs</p>
<p>and try and do it through mostly diaphragmatic breathing,</p>
<p>just for sake of example.</p>
<p>In other words, try and breathe in through your mouth</p>
<p>and as you do that, have your belly expand</p>
<p>and maximally inflate your lungs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do it right now with you</p>
<p>so that we can do it together</p>
<p>and I can prove to everyone</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m just as deficient in this as you are.</p>
<p>Okay, so I can inflate my stomach doing that,</p>
<p>but now try doing it with your nose</p>
<p>and please do exhale before you try doing it with your nose.</p>
<p>With your nose, you&rsquo;re going to feel more resistance,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ll notice that you can inflate it</p>
<p>quite a bit further.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll feel your entire cavity, your belly,</p>
<p>and maybe even in your lower back,</p>
<p>sort of fill with some pressure.</p>
<p>So the increased resistance actually allows you</p>
<p>to draw more air into the system.</p>
<p>This turns out to be very important</p>
<p>and it also wipes away a common misconception,</p>
<p>which is if you&rsquo;re somebody who has challenges</p>
<p>breathing in through your nose,</p>
<p>that somehow you should avoid breathing in</p>
<p>through your nose.</p>
<p>Actually quite the opposite is true</p>
<p>and we can go a step further and say</p>
<p>that if you have challenges breathing in through your nose,</p>
<p>chances are that&rsquo;s because the increased resistance</p>
<p>of breathing in through your nose,</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s not completely occluded,</p>
<p>is going to allow you to bring more oxygen into your system.</p>
<p>This will turn out to be useful later</p>
<p>when we explore different techniques, for instance,</p>
<p>not just to calm down quickly,</p>
<p>but to elevate your energy quickly,</p>
<p>to remove a cramp during exercise,</p>
<p>and a number of other things that breathing can be used for</p>
<p>that can be immensely useful</p>
<p>for mental and physical challenges.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a quick break</p>
<p>and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens, now called AG1,</p>
<p>is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink</p>
<p>that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or usually twice a day</p>
<p>is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health.</p>
<p>Our gut is very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s populated by gut microbiota,</p>
<p>that communicate with the brain, the immune system,</p>
<p>and basically all the biological systems of our body</p>
<p>to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>And those probiotics in Athletic Greens are optimal</p>
<p>and vital for microbiotic health.</p>
<p>In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens,</p>
<p>vitamins, and minerals that make sure</p>
<p>that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met,</p>
<p>and it tastes great.</p>

<p>and the year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s talk about the chemical aspects of breathing,</p>
<p>and the two major players in this discussion are oxygen,</p>
<p>which all the cells and tissues of your body need,</p>
<p>and carbon dioxide,</p>
<p>which all the cells and tissues of your body need.</p>
<p>In fact, carbon dioxide plays critical roles</p>
<p>in delivering oxygen to your cells,</p>
<p>and without carbon dioxide,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to get enough oxygen</p>
<p>to the cells and tissues of your body.</p>
<p>That said, if carbon dioxide levels are too high,</p>
<p>that is very problematic.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the ways that one can reliably induce panic</p>
<p>in anybody is to have them breathe air</p>
<p>that contains too much carbon dioxide,</p>
<p>so much so that for people that lack a so-called amygdala,</p>
<p>many of you have probably heard of the amygdala,</p>
<p>this is a brain area that&rsquo;s associated with fear</p>
<p>and threat detection,</p>
<p>even in people who completely lack amygdalas</p>
<p>on both sides of the brain,</p>
<p>because they were removed,</p>
<p>because they had epileptic seizures there,</p>
<p>and therefore those people are completely unafraid</p>
<p>of things that they ought to be afraid of,</p>
<p>like heights, poisonous snakes,</p>
<p>any number of different things, dangerous to humans.</p>
<p>Well, if those people breathe an excess amount</p>
<p>of carbon dioxide, they immediately have a panic attack.</p>
<p>What that tells us is that, again,</p>
<p>there are parallel mechanisms,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s redundancy in the system to protect ourselves</p>
<p>from having too much carbon dioxide in our system.</p>
<p>So we need enough carbon dioxide and enough oxygen</p>
<p>in our system, but not too much.</p>
<p>The way that&rsquo;s accomplished is that, of course,</p>
<p>we breathe in air, our lungs inflate,</p>
<p>and if you recall those little alveoli of the lungs,</p>
<p>those little sacs, oxygen can actually move</p>
<p>from the air into those little sacs,</p>
<p>and then from those little sacs into the vasculature.</p>
<p>The vasculature are the capillaries, the veins,</p>
<p>and the arteries of the body,</p>
<p>because the walls of those little alveoli</p>
<p>are exceedingly thin, and they have tons</p>
<p>of little capillaries that go into them</p>
<p>and are all around them.</p>
<p>So this is amazing, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s oxygen literally passing from inside</p>
<p>of these little sacs in our lungs,</p>
<p>because we inhaled the oxygen, from the air,</p>
<p>into the bloodstream, and then that oxygen gets bound up</p>
<p>by proteins in the blood, in particular, hemoglobin,</p>
<p>and hemoglobin then delivers oxygen</p>
<p>to the various cells and tissues of the body.</p>
<p>However, oxygen can&rsquo;t just hop on hemoglobin</p>
<p>and cruise along with hemoglobin until it gets</p>
<p>to, say, your brain and then hop off.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p>
<p>You require carbon dioxide in order</p>
<p>to liberate oxygen from hemoglobin.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide has this incredible property</p>
<p>of actually being able to change the shape of hemoglobin.</p>
<p>Hemoglobin is shaped as a sort of a cage</p>
<p>around oxygen molecules, and when it&rsquo;s in that cage shape,</p>
<p>the oxygen can&rsquo;t be liberated.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got oxygen and hemoglobin bound to one another,</p>
<p>moving through your bloodstream,</p>
<p>but if a tissue needs oxygen,</p>
<p>there needs to be carbon dioxide present</p>
<p>to open up that cage, and that&rsquo;s what carbon dioxide does.</p>
<p>It allows that cage to change shape,</p>
<p>and then the oxygen can be liberated</p>
<p>and then can be delivered to the tissues,</p>
<p>whether or not that&rsquo;s brain tissue or muscle tissue,</p>
<p>so on and so forth.</p>
<p>And so those are the major chemical components of breathing.</p>
<p>There are a few other aspects related</p>
<p>to the chemical components of breathing,</p>
<p>such as the fact that carbon dioxide is strongly related</p>
<p>to how acidic or how basic your body is in general.</p>
<p>So for instance, if carbon dioxide levels go way down,</p>
<p>your blood pH goes way up.</p>
<p>That is, you become more alkaline.</p>
<p>Now, for many people, the word pH</p>
<p>and the whole concept of pH immediately starts</p>
<p>to evoke anxiety in and of itself.</p>
<p>pH is actually very simple.</p>
<p>You want the body basically to be at a pH of about 7.4.</p>
<p>There are some regions of your body,</p>
<p>in particular along the gut,</p>
<p>which that number is importantly different</p>
<p>in order for digestion to work properly.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve all heard of the gut microbiome,</p>
<p>the little microbes that provided you have enough of them</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re diverse enough,</p>
<p>allow your brain and body to function optimally</p>
<p>at the level of immune system, hormone system,</p>
<p>brain, et cetera.</p>
<p>Well, in the gut,</p>
<p>you want the pH sometimes to be slightly more acidic,</p>
<p>because when it&rsquo;s more acidic,</p>
<p>the little microbiota flourish far more</p>
<p>than if it were more basic.</p>
<p>But basically you want the rest of the body</p>
<p>to be at about pH 7.4.</p>
<p>If carbon dioxide levels go too low,</p>
<p>the pH increases in a way that you might say,</p>
<p>oh, well, that&rsquo;s bad,</p>
<p>but that actually allows more oxygen to be available</p>
<p>to the tissues of your body, at least temporarily.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about this a bit more later.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m losing any of you, just hang in there</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re almost done with this whole business</p>
<p>of the mechanics and the chemistry of breathing.</p>
<p>And then we can get into the tools</p>
<p>and revisit some of this later</p>
<p>to clean up any misunderstandings that may have arisen.</p>
<p>But as we&rsquo;re talking about carbon dioxide over and over again</p>
<p>and how key it is to have carbon dioxide</p>
<p>and the problems with it going too high or too low,</p>
<p>you should probably be asking yourself</p>
<p>what actually makes carbon dioxide go too low, right?</p>
<p>We know that we breathe in oxygen</p>
<p>and then it can pass from the lungs</p>
<p>and the alveoli into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>And then we need carbon dioxide to liberate oxygen</p>
<p>from the hemoglobin into the cells and tissues of the body.</p>
<p>And we know that when we exhale,</p>
<p>actually, I haven&rsquo;t told you this yet,</p>
<p>but you should know that when you exhale,</p>
<p>carbon dioxide is actually taken from the bloodstream</p>
<p>back into those alveoli of the lungs.</p>
<p>And then when you exhale,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s expelled through your mouth or through your nose</p>
<p>out into the world.</p>
<p>So the way I just described all that,</p>
<p>inhale, bring in oxygen, exhale, expel carbon dioxide,</p>
<p>pretty straightforward, right?</p>
<p>Indeed it is.</p>
<p>And it also tells you that were you to exhale a lot more</p>
<p>or a lot more vigorously,</p>
<p>you would expel more carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>And in fact, that&rsquo;s exactly the way it works.</p>
<p>When you hyperventilate,</p>
<p>of course you are inhaling more than usual,</p>
<p>but you are also exhaling more than usual.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re of course bringing in more air</p>
<p>and oxygen to your body,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re also removing more carbon dioxide</p>
<p>from your body than normal.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide,</p>
<p>because of the ways that it regulates brain state,</p>
<p>in fact, the way in which it regulates the excitability,</p>
<p>literally the ability of your neurons</p>
<p>to engage electrically or not,</p>
<p>it can create states of panic and anxiety,</p>
<p>which is why when you hyperventilate,</p>
<p>you feel an increase in anxiety,</p>
<p>or when you feel an increase in anxiety,</p>
<p>you hyperventilate, it&rsquo;s a reciprocal relationship.</p>
<p>In fact, I don&rsquo;t want anyone who has anxiety</p>
<p>or who has panic attacks to try this now,</p>
<p>but for most people, it&rsquo;s probably safe</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re not driving or doing something mechanical</p>
<p>or operating machinery that is,</p>
<p>probably safe to do 25 or 30 deep inhales and exhales.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll notice that by about breath 10,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll start to feel tingly</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll probably feel a little bit more alert.</p>
<p>And again, if you have anxiety or panic attack tendencies,</p>
<p>please don&rsquo;t do this,</p>
<p>but you will feel an increase in so-called autonomic arousal</p>
<p>and increase in the activity</p>
<p>of your overall sympathetic nervous system,</p>
<p>which has nothing to do with sympathy,</p>
<p>has everything to do with alertness.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll actually deploy adrenaline from your adrenals.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll just do this now.</p>
<p>You can try this now, again,</p>
<p>provided you&rsquo;re in a safe place</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have anxiety or panic attack tendencies.</p>
<p>You will just breathe in through your nose</p>
<p>and out through your mouth.</p>
<p>Remember, we&rsquo;re breathing in more and more vigorously</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re exhaling more and more vigorously</p>
<p>than we normally would.</p>
<p>It goes something like this.</p>
<p>Now, by breath eight or nine or 10,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll notice that your body starts to heat up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s due to a couple of things,</p>
<p>mainly the release of adrenaline from your adrenals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m already feeling a little bit lightheaded.</p>
<p>The lightheadedness is actually because your vasculature,</p>
<p>the capillaries and veins,</p>
<p>and to some extent, even the arteries of your body,</p>
<p>and particularly in your brain,</p>
<p>are actually starting to constrict.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re cutting off blood flow to the brain.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, because carbon dioxide actually is a vasodilator.</p>
<p>Normally it exists in your body to keep capillaries,</p>
<p>veins, and arteries dilated</p>
<p>to allow blood to pass through them.</p>
<p>When you hyperventilate,</p>
<p>sure, you&rsquo;re bringing in a lot of oxygen,</p>
<p>which you think would make you more alert,</p>
<p>and indeed it does,</p>
<p>but you are also expelling a lot more carbon dioxide</p>
<p>than you normally would,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s causing some vasoconstriction,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to start feeling tingly in the periphery,</p>
<p>in your fingers and toes, perhaps, or your legs.</p>
<p>You will also notice that you&rsquo;re feeling more alert</p>
<p>in the brain, but that you might start</p>
<p>to feel a bit of anxiety.</p>
<p>So hyperventilation, yes, brings in more oxygen,</p>
<p>also removes more carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>The removal of excess carbon dioxide</p>
<p>puts you into a state that&rsquo;s called hypocapnic, right?</p>
<p>Hypoxia, hypoxia is reduced levels of oxygen</p>
<p>relative to normal.</p>
<p>Hypocapnia is reduced levels of carbon dioxide</p>
<p>relative to normal,</p>
<p>and it is those reduced levels of carbon dioxide</p>
<p>that are largely responsible for that elevation in energy,</p>
<p>and at the same time, a feeling of a bit of anxiety,</p>
<p>the constriction of the microvasculature</p>
<p>in the brain and body,</p>
<p>and therefore the feelings of being kind of tingly</p>
<p>and having kind of an urgency to move.</p>
<p>Okay, so by now it should be clear</p>
<p>that we need both oxygen and carbon dioxide,</p>
<p>and across the course of this episode,</p>
<p>I will explain how to adjust those ratios of oxygen</p>
<p>to carbon dioxide,</p>
<p>depending on what your immediate needs are</p>
<p>and what you plan to do next,</p>
<p>whether or not that&rsquo;s sleep or exercise</p>
<p>or some mental work, et cetera.</p>
<p>Before going any further, however,</p>
<p>there is something I want to touch on</p>
<p>because even though not everyone will experience this,</p>
<p>I think enough people experience it</p>
<p>that it is of interest,</p>
<p>and now&rsquo;s the right time to touch into what happens</p>
<p>when you go up to a very high altitude,</p>
<p>meaning why it&rsquo;s hard to breathe</p>
<p>when you get up to high altitudes.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re close to sea level,</p>
<p>you are getting kind of the optimal balance of oxygen</p>
<p>in the air you breathe.</p>
<p>As you ascend in altitude,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s say you go to 6,000 feet or 10,000</p>
<p>or maybe even 11,000 feet above sea level,</p>
<p>or maybe you&rsquo;re one of those rare individuals</p>
<p>that climbs Denali or you climb Mount Everest</p>
<p>and you get up there and you notice that</p>
<p>most people are going to wear an oxygen mask.</p>
<p>Why is it that you need an oxygen mask</p>
<p>at those very high altitudes</p>
<p>or when people do these very high altitude skydives</p>
<p>that they need oxygen way up high?</p>
<p>Well, a lot of people will say,</p>
<p>oh, there&rsquo;s not much oxygen up there,</p>
<p>you know, the air is thinner.</p>
<p>Okay, well, perhaps a better way to think about it</p>
<p>is that remember when we were talking about</p>
<p>the mechanical aspects of breathing</p>
<p>and the fact that the lungs don&rsquo;t really move themselves,</p>
<p>that they have the muscles, the diaphragm</p>
<p>and the intercostal muscles to move them.</p>
<p>Well, a lot of the reason why your lungs</p>
<p>can fill so readily with air</p>
<p>is that when you don&rsquo;t have much air in your lungs,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s very low air pressure in your lungs</p>
<p>relative to outside you, okay?</p>
<p>So what we mean then is if you were to open up your mouth</p>
<p>or your nose and breathe in,</p>
<p>that is breathe in through your nose or mouth,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to happen is air is going to move</p>
<p>from high pressure to low pressure.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very easy to fill your lungs,</p>
<p>even though you need those muscles</p>
<p>to move the various things around</p>
<p>that allow your lungs to fill,</p>
<p>the air is going to go from high pressure to low pressure.</p>
<p>So for those of you listening,</p>
<p>I just took a big inhale through my nose.</p>
<p>And then when you exhale, right,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically taking the lungs from a state</p>
<p>in which the pressure is really high in the lungs,</p>
<p>you know, high pressure, like a balloon that&rsquo;s full.</p>
<p>And the pressure in your lungs when your lungs are full</p>
<p>is higher than the air outside.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s pretty easy to expel that air</p>
<p>through the nose or mouth.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re at high altitudes, the air pressure is lower.</p>
<p>And so what happens is when the air pressure</p>
<p>is lower outside your body</p>
<p>and your lungs are not full of air,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have that really steep gradient</p>
<p>of high pressure outside the body</p>
<p>to low pressure inside your lungs.</p>
<p>And so you actually have to put a lot more effort</p>
<p>into breathing air into your lungs.</p>
<p>You have to really exert a lot of force.</p>
<p>You have to get the diaphragm,</p>
<p>those intercostal muscles working really hard.</p>
<p>You might even find that your shoulders are lifting</p>
<p>with each breath,</p>
<p>because you really have to generate a lot of force</p>
<p>to get enough air and oxygen into your lungs.</p>
<p>Now, an important principle to understand</p>
<p>is that in humans and in some other species,</p>
<p>but really what we&rsquo;re talking about now as humans,</p>
<p>when you inhale, that&rsquo;s an active process.</p>
<p>You really need to use those muscles of the intercostals</p>
<p>and the diaphragm in order to inflate the lungs.</p>
<p>But the whole process is made easier</p>
<p>when air pressure outside your body is higher</p>
<p>than it is in your lungs,</p>
<p>because then they&rsquo;re going to fill up really readily.</p>
<p>Exhaling, at least for humans, is a passive thing.</p>
<p>You just have to relax the diaphragm</p>
<p>and relax the intercostals</p>
<p>and let the ribcage kind of fall back</p>
<p>to its original position.</p>
<p>So inhaling is active and exhaling is passive.</p>
<p>And so what happens is if you&rsquo;re at a high altitude</p>
<p>and the air pressure is very low,</p>
<p>then you have to put a lot of energy</p>
<p>into breathing air into your lungs</p>
<p>to get an equivalent amount of oxygen into your lungs</p>
<p>and then into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why when you arrive at a high altitude location</p>
<p>for the first few days,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to feel lightheaded, maybe a headache.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also going to have more buildup</p>
<p>of carbon dioxide in your system.</p>
<p>And so the whole balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide</p>
<p>is going to be disrupted.</p>
<p>I mention all that because yes, indeed,</p>
<p>there are some changes in the atmospheric gases</p>
<p>at high altitudes,</p>
<p>and that can impact how much oxygen</p>
<p>you can bring into your system, into your tissues.</p>
<p>But, you know, I&rsquo;ve heard many explanations</p>
<p>of why it&rsquo;s hard to breathe</p>
<p>or why you feel lousy at altitude.</p>
<p>Well, you just discovered one reason,</p>
<p>which is that you don&rsquo;t have that steep high pressure</p>
<p>to low pressure gradient from the outside of the body</p>
<p>into the inside of the body.</p>
<p>The converse is also true.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been at altitude for a few days</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to adjust,</p>
<p>a lot of athletes, for instance, will go train at altitude.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for them in the first days or weeks,</p>
<p>and then they get really good at training at altitude.</p>
<p>There are a number of different adaptations that occur</p>
<p>in terms of the amount of oxygen</p>
<p>that can be carried in the blood by hemoglobin</p>
<p>and the interactions between carbon dioxide</p>
<p>and hemoglobin and oxygen</p>
<p>that allow more oxygen to be delivered to the tissues,</p>
<p>such that at altitude, you can function just normally.</p>
<p>But if you then move very quickly from altitude,</p>
<p>say you&rsquo;ve been training at 8,000 feet or 10,000 feet,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been hiking up at the high level and you&rsquo;ve adapted,</p>
<p>and you come down to sea level,</p>
<p>well, for about two to five days,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to feel like an absolute beast.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be able to essentially deliver</p>
<p>far more oxygen to your muscles per breath.</p>
<p>In part, that is because of the way that the hemoglobin</p>
<p>and the oxygen that it&rsquo;s carrying has been altered</p>
<p>when you were at high altitude,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also because when you were at that high altitude,</p>
<p>those intracostal muscles and those diaphragms</p>
<p>got trained up quite a bit</p>
<p>and allowed you to generate more air volume</p>
<p>for every breath.</p>
<p>In other words, those muscles got stronger</p>
<p>and you got more efficient at driving the phrenic nerve</p>
<p>consciously to really breathe in a lot of oxygen</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t feel lightheaded, headache, et cetera.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s a little bit of an aside,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an important aside, I believe,</p>
<p>because A, it answers a question a lot of people ask</p>
<p>and a lot of people wonder about,</p>
<p>and B, because it incorporates</p>
<p>both the mechanical aspects of breathing</p>
<p>and the chemical aspects of breathing.</p>
<p>I realize it&rsquo;s a little bit of a unusual circumstance,</p>
<p>but now if anyone asks you</p>
<p>why it&rsquo;s hard to breathe at altitude,</p>
<p>you know it has to do with this lack of a high pressure</p>
<p>to low pressure gradient across the body</p>
<p>and with the atmosphere outside you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also an opportunity for me to say</p>
<p>that if you do find yourself at altitude</p>
<p>and you have a headache</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re feeling like you just can&rsquo;t catch your breath,</p>
<p>spending some time really consciously</p>
<p>trying to draw in larger breaths of air,</p>
<p>as much as that might seem fatiguing</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll be short of breath,</p>
<p>it will allow you to adapt more quickly.</p>
<p>And a little bit later in the episode,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll touch on a few methods,</p>
<p>including deliberate hyperventilation</p>
<p>combined with some breath holds</p>
<p>that can allow you to deliver more oxygen to the cells</p>
<p>immediately upon arriving at altitude</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t get quite as much headache,</p>
<p>disorientation, and so on.</p>
<p>So leaving breathing at altitude aside,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s all come back down to the same conceptual level.</p>
<p>We can ask ourselves, for instance,</p>
<p>what is healthy breathing and what is unhealthy breathing?</p>
<p>And the first place we want to tackle this</p>
<p>is within the context of sleep.</p>
<p>So when we go to sleep at night, we continue to breathe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s no surprise.</p>
<p>If we didn&rsquo;t, we would die during sleep.</p>
<p>However, there is a large fraction of the population</p>
<p>that under breathes during sleep.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not taking deep enough or frequent enough breaths,</p>
<p>and therefore they are experiencing</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called sleep apnea.</p>
<p>They are becoming hypoxic, hypoxic.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s less oxygen being brought into their system</p>
<p>than is necessary.</p>
<p>People that are carrying excess weight,</p>
<p>either fat weight or muscle weight or both,</p>
<p>are more prone to nighttime sleep apnea.</p>
<p>However, there are a lot of people who are not overweight</p>
<p>who also experience sleep apnea.</p>
<p>How do you know if you&rsquo;re experiencing sleep apnea?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, excessive daytime sleepiness</p>
<p>and excessive daytime anxiety</p>
<p>combined with daytime sleepiness is one sign</p>
<p>that you might be suffering from sleep apnea.</p>
<p>The other thing is if you happen to snore,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very likely that you are experiencing sleep apnea.</p>
<p>And I should mention that sleep apnea</p>
<p>is a very serious health concern.</p>
<p>It greatly increases the probability</p>
<p>of a cardiovascular event, heart attack, stroke.</p>
<p>It is a precursor or sometimes the direct cause</p>
<p>of sexual dysfunction in males and females,</p>
<p>cognitive dysfunction during the daytime.</p>
<p>It can exacerbate the effects of dementia,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s age-related dementia of the normal sort</p>
<p>or Alzheimer&rsquo;s type dementia,</p>
<p>which is an acceleration of age-related cognitive decline.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s had a traumatic brain injury,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re experiencing a lot of stress,</p>
<p>sleep apnea is going to greatly disrupt</p>
<p>the amount of oxygen brought into your brain and body</p>
<p>during sleep and is going to lead to a number</p>
<p>of nighttime and daytime issues.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s something that really needs to be addressed.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll get into this a bit more later,</p>
<p>but since I raised it as a problem,</p>
<p>I do want to raise the solution.</p>
<p>One of the major treatments for sleep apnea</p>
<p>is that people will get a CPAP device,</p>
<p>which is this face mask and a machine</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ll sleep with.</p>
<p>And while those can be very effective,</p>
<p>not everyone needs a CPAP.</p>
<p>One of the more common methods nowadays</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being used to treat sleep apnea,</p>
<p>which is purely behavioral and intervention</p>
<p>and is essentially zero cost</p>
<p>is that people are starting to shift deliberately</p>
<p>to nasal breathing during sleep</p>
<p>because of the additional resistance of nasal breathing.</p>
<p>And because of the fact that there&rsquo;s far less tendency,</p>
<p>if any, excuse me, to snore when nasal breathing.</p>
<p>Taping the mouth shut using medical tape prior to sleep,</p>
<p>excuse me, putting medical tape on the mouth</p>
<p>prior to going to sleep and then sleeping all night</p>
<p>with medical tape on the mouth is one way</p>
<p>that people can learn to nasal breathe during sleep</p>
<p>and can greatly offset a lot of sleep apnea,</p>
<p>snoring and sleep related issues.</p>
<p>A number of people don&rsquo;t want to or don&rsquo;t feel safe</p>
<p>putting medical tape on their mouth prior to sleep.</p>
<p>For some reason, they think they&rsquo;re going to suffocate,</p>
<p>but of course you would wake up</p>
<p>if you start to run out of air at any moment.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not so much a concern,</p>
<p>but what they&rsquo;ll do is they will start to use</p>
<p>pure nasal breathing during any type of exercise</p>
<p>or even just for some period of time</p>
<p>walking during the day or while working.</p>
<p>And again, later we&rsquo;ll get into the enormous benefits</p>
<p>of shifting to pure nasal breathing</p>
<p>when not exercising hard,</p>
<p>meaning at a rate that you could normally</p>
<p>hold a conversation,</p>
<p>although if you&rsquo;re pure nasal breathing,</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t be holding that conversation</p>
<p>or when simply doing work</p>
<p>or any number of things that are sort of low intensity,</p>
<p>you can train your system to become a better nasal breather</p>
<p>during the daytime through these deliberate actions</p>
<p>of taping the mouth shut</p>
<p>or just being conscious of keeping your mouth shut.</p>
<p>And that in addition to having a number of positive health</p>
<p>and aesthetic effects during the daytime</p>
<p>is known to also transfer to nighttime breathing patterns</p>
<p>and allow people to become nasal breathers</p>
<p>as opposed to mouth breathers during sleep</p>
<p>and to snore less and to have less sleep apnea.</p>
<p>Again, if you have severe sleep apnea,</p>
<p>you probably do need to check out a CPAP.</p>
<p>You should talk to your physician,</p>
<p>but for people who have minor sleep apnea</p>
<p>or sleep apnea that&rsquo;s starting to take hold,</p>
<p>these other methods of shifting to becoming a nasal breather</p>
<p>are going to be far more beneficial</p>
<p>and far more cost effective</p>
<p>than going all the way to the CPAP,</p>
<p>which by the way,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really teach you how to breathe properly</p>
<p>as much as it does adjust the airflow</p>
<p>going into your system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an important point</p>
<p>that when you shift from mouth to nasal breathing</p>
<p>during sleep,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually learning and training your system</p>
<p>to breathe properly.</p>
<p>And when I say learning and training your system</p>
<p>to breathe properly, what do I mean?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put some scientific and mechanistic meat on that.</p>
<p>We already talked about the phrenic nerve,</p>
<p>this nerve that innervates the diaphragm</p>
<p>and that allows for the lungs to fill up</p>
<p>because of the movement of the diaphragm.</p>
<p>What we didn&rsquo;t talk about, however,</p>
<p>were the brain centers that actually control</p>
<p>the phrenic nerve and control breathing.</p>
<p>Knowing about these two brain areas</p>
<p>and what they do is extremely important,</p>
<p>not just for understanding the content of this episode,</p>
<p>but for understanding all of the tools that we&rsquo;ll discuss</p>
<p>and indeed your general health</p>
<p>as it relates to respiration.</p>
<p>So there are basically two areas of the brain</p>
<p>that control breathing.</p>
<p>The first is called the pre-Buttsinger complex.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to worry about the name so much,</p>
<p>just know that it was named after a bottle of wine</p>
<p>and that it was discovered.</p>
<p>By the great Jack Feldman,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a professor of neuroscience</p>
<p>at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>
<p>This is one of the most fundamental discoveries</p>
<p>in all of neuroscience in the last hundred years or more,</p>
<p>because this brain area</p>
<p>that Jack and his colleagues discovered</p>
<p>controls all aspects of breathing that are rhythmic.</p>
<p>That is when inhales, follow exhales,</p>
<p>follow inhales, follow exhales.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all controlled by a small set of neurons</p>
<p>in this brainstem area,</p>
<p>so around the region of the neck,</p>
<p>called the pre-Buttsinger complex.</p>
<p>And we really owe a debt of gratitude</p>
<p>to Jack and his colleagues for discovering that area</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s involved in everything</p>
<p>from breathing when we&rsquo;re asleep</p>
<p>to breathing when we&rsquo;re not thinking about our breathing.</p>
<p>It may have a role,</p>
<p>that is when its function is disrupted,</p>
<p>it may cause things like sudden infant death syndrome.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, it can explain in large part</p>
<p>many of the deaths related to the opioid crisis</p>
<p>because exogenous opioids like fentanyl</p>
<p>and other sorts of drugs, which are opioids, obviously,</p>
<p>bind to opioid receptors on that structure</p>
<p>and shut it down.</p>
<p>Now, keep in mind,</p>
<p>these neurons are designed to be incredibly robust</p>
<p>and are designed to fire, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,</p>
<p>no matter if we&rsquo;re awake or aware, unaware,</p>
<p>or asleep to keep us alive.</p>
<p>Exogenous opioids like fentanyl</p>
<p>and drugs that are similar to that</p>
<p>can shut down that structure</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s rich with these opioid receptors,</p>
<p>so it binds to that</p>
<p>and it shuts off the prebotzinger complex,</p>
<p>which is the major cause of death</p>
<p>of people who die from opioid overdoses.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people don&rsquo;t realize that.</p>
<p>They think, oh, the opioids must shut off the brain</p>
<p>or shut down the heart.</p>
<p>No, it shuts down breathing.</p>
<p>So Jack&rsquo;s discovery, no doubt,</p>
<p>will lead to some important things</p>
<p>as it relates to addiction.</p>
<p>And hopefully, I think we frankly can expect</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s also going to eventually lead to ways</p>
<p>to prevent death in people using opioids</p>
<p>or other types of drugs,</p>
<p>maybe by blocking opioid receptors</p>
<p>in prebotzinger complex</p>
<p>using things like naltrexone, et cetera.</p>
<p>In any event, prebotzinger complex</p>
<p>is controlling inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale</p>
<p>to patterns of breathing.</p>
<p>The other brain center controlling breathing,</p>
<p>again, through the phrenic nerve, right?</p>
<p>It all converges and goes out through the phrenic nerve</p>
<p>and these intracostal muscles</p>
<p>is the so-called parafacial nucleus.</p>
<p>And the parafacial nucleus</p>
<p>is involved in patterns of breathing</p>
<p>where there is not an inhale followed by exhale,</p>
<p>that is, it&rsquo;s not rhythmic one than the other,</p>
<p>but rather where there is a doubling up of inhales</p>
<p>or a doubling up of exhales</p>
<p>or a deliberate pause in breathing.</p>
<p>So inhale, pause, exhale, pause,</p>
<p>inhale, pause, exhale, pause, this sort of thing.</p>
<p>A little bit later, we&rsquo;ll talk about</p>
<p>a pattern of breathing called box breathing,</p>
<p>which has a very specific and useful applications</p>
<p>in particular for adjusting anxiety.</p>
<p>And in that case, it involves going</p>
<p>from rhythmic breathing of inhale, inhale, inhale, exhale,</p>
<p>that is relying on the pre-Butzinger complex neurons</p>
<p>to reliance on the parafacial nucleus neurons</p>
<p>and box breathing just to give away</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s probably already obvious</p>
<p>is you inhale, hold, exhale, hold, and repeat.</p>
<p>And that pattern of breathing,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s rhythmic in nature</p>
<p>because inhales precede exhales,</p>
<p>precede inhales and so on,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a deliberate breath hold inserted there.</p>
<p>So anytime we&rsquo;re taking conscious control of our breathing,</p>
<p>the parafacial nucleus is getting involved.</p>
<p>Now, you don&rsquo;t have to assume</p>
<p>that the parafacial nucleus is the only way</p>
<p>in which we take conscious control of our breathing.</p>
<p>We can also take control of the pre-Butzinger complex.</p>
<p>You can do that right now.</p>
<p>So for instance, you are breathing</p>
<p>in some specific pattern now</p>
<p>that unless you&rsquo;re speaking or eating,</p>
<p>no doubt is going to involve inhales followed by exhales.</p>
<p>But you could, for instance, decide that,</p>
<p>yes, inhales are active and exhales are passive,</p>
<p>but now you&rsquo;re going to make the exhales active as well.</p>
<p>So rather than just inhale and then let your lungs deflate,</p>
<p>you could inhale and then force the air out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to represent a conscious taking over of control</p>
<p>of the pre-Butzinger complex.</p>
<p>Okay, so the reason I&rsquo;m giving this mechanistic detail</p>
<p>is A, it&rsquo;s super important if you want to understand</p>
<p>all the tools related to breathing.</p>
<p>B, it&rsquo;s actually a pretty simple system.</p>
<p>Even though the areas have fancy names</p>
<p>like pre-Butzinger or parafacial,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty straightforward, right?</p>
<p>You have one area that controls rhythmic breathing,</p>
<p>inhale follows exhales.</p>
<p>And the other area which gets involved in breathing</p>
<p>anytime you start doubling up on inhales or exhales.</p>
<p>In fact, the parafacial nucleus</p>
<p>is the one that you&rsquo;re relying on while you speak</p>
<p>in order to make sure that you still get enough oxygen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the one that you will use</p>
<p>if you incorporate the physiological sigh or box breathing.</p>
<p>And frankly, most of the time</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re using both of these circuits or these brain systems,</p>
<p>parafacial and pre-Butzinger in parallel.</p>
<p>Again, biology loves parallel systems,</p>
<p>especially for things that are so critical</p>
<p>that if we didn&rsquo;t do them, we would die like breathing.</p>
<p>And so it makes sense that we have</p>
<p>two different brain structures that control this.</p>
<p>So now you have an understanding</p>
<p>of the mechanical control of breathing.</p>
<p>That is the different parts within the parts list</p>
<p>that are involved in breathing,</p>
<p>everything from nose to mouth, to alveoli, the lungs,</p>
<p>et cetera, and the muscles involved in moving the lungs.</p>
<p>You understand, I like to think a bit about</p>
<p>bringing oxygen in and removing carbon dioxide,</p>
<p>but not so much carbon dioxide</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t actually use the oxygen that you have.</p>
<p>And you know about two brain centers,</p>
<p>one controlling rhythmic breathing</p>
<p>and one that controls non-rhythmic breathing.</p>
<p>I want to repeat something</p>
<p>that I said a little bit earlier as well,</p>
<p>which is that breathing is incredible</p>
<p>because it represents the interface</p>
<p>between conscious and subconscious control</p>
<p>over your not just body, not just your lungs,</p>
<p>but that how you breathe influences your brain state.</p>
<p>So by using your brain consciously to control your breathing</p>
<p>you are using your brain to control your brain.</p>
<p>The best way I&rsquo;ve ever heard this described</p>
<p>was from a beautiful, I should say now classic paper</p>
<p>in the Journal of Physiology published in 1988</p>
<p>from Balistrino and Somjian</p>
<p>where the final line of their summary intro states,</p>
<p>the brain by regulating breathing</p>
<p>controls its own excitability.</p>
<p>And just to remind those of you</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t remember what excitability is,</p>
<p>excitability is the threshold at which a given neuron,</p>
<p>nerve cell can be active or not.</p>
<p>So when we breathe a certain way,</p>
<p>the neurons of our brain are more likely to get engaged.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re more likely to be active.</p>
<p>And when we breathe in other ways,</p>
<p>our brain becomes harder to activate.</p>
<p>Its excitability is reduced.</p>
<p>Now you might think excitability is a great thing.</p>
<p>You always want your brain to be excitable,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s actually not the case.</p>
<p>And in fact, that very statement</p>
<p>that Balistrino and Somjian made</p>
<p>led to a number of other investigations</p>
<p>that were really important in defining</p>
<p>how if people over-breathe,</p>
<p>that is if they hyperventilate at rest,</p>
<p>they expel, that is they exhale too much carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>What that classic paper by Balistrino and Somjian led to</p>
<p>was a number of different investigations in humans</p>
<p>looking at how different patterns of breathing</p>
<p>impact the overall state of the brain</p>
<p>and the ability of the brain to respond to certain</p>
<p>what are called sensory stimuli.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that your brain is always active.</p>
<p>The neurons are firing at low level, low level, low level.</p>
<p>But when you see something or hear something,</p>
<p>or you want to focus on something,</p>
<p>or you want to exercise or really listen to something</p>
<p>or learn, certain circuits in your brain</p>
<p>need to be more active than everything else.</p>
<p>That is there needs to be really high</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called signal to noise.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always a lot of noise and chatter in the background,</p>
<p>just like the chatter at a cocktail party</p>
<p>or at a stadium event.</p>
<p>In order to really pay attention, focus, learn,</p>
<p>all the incredible things that the brain can do,</p>
<p>you need that signal to get above the noise.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a beautiful paper that asks,</p>
<p>how does the pattern of breathing,</p>
<p>in particular, how does over-breathing</p>
<p>change the patterns of activity in the brain?</p>
<p>This is a paper entitled</p>
<p>Effects of Voluntary Hyperventilation</p>
<p>on Cortical Sensory Responses.</p>
<p>And I will provide a link to the study</p>
<p>in the show note captions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a somewhat complicated paper.</p>
<p>If you look at all the detailed analyses,</p>
<p>however, the takeaway from this paper is exquisitely simple.</p>
<p>And I also believe incredibly important.</p>
<p>Basically what it showed is that when people hyperventilate,</p>
<p>they expel, that is they exhale more carbon dioxide</p>
<p>than they would normally.</p>
<p>So they become what&rsquo;s called hypocapnic, okay?</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide levels are low in the blood.</p>
<p>And over a short period of time,</p>
<p>they become low in the tissues of the body.</p>
<p>When that carbon dioxide level drops low,</p>
<p>you would say, okay, well,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still bringing in a lot of oxygen</p>
<p>because these people are hyperventilating,</p>
<p>so they should feel really alert.</p>
<p>And indeed, that&rsquo;s what happens.</p>
<p>The people feel very alert.</p>
<p>However, because they&rsquo;re not bringing</p>
<p>enough carbon dioxide in,</p>
<p>or rather the proper way to say it would be</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re over-breathing, exhaling too much,</p>
<p>they are not retaining or keeping in enough carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>Well, then that lack of carbon dioxide means</p>
<p>that the oxygen that they are breathing in</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be liberated from the hemoglobin,</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t get to the brain.</p>
<p>And what they observe is about a 30 to 40% reduction</p>
<p>in the amount of oxygen that&rsquo;s being delivered to the brain.</p>
<p>And the reduction in carbon dioxide</p>
<p>also prevents some of the normal patterns of vasodilation,</p>
<p>the dilating, the opening up of the capillaries.</p>
<p>So again, less blood flow, but most importantly,</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s shown in this paper,</p>
<p>the brain overall becomes hyper excitable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if it&rsquo;s being starved of oxygen and blood flow,</p>
<p>and all the neurons in a very nonspecific way</p>
<p>start increasing their firing levels.</p>
<p>So the background activity is getting louder and louder.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the rumbler, the noise of a crowd at a stadium.</p>
<p>And as a consequence, the sensory input from a sound</p>
<p>or from a touch or from some other event in the world</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t get above the noise.</p>
<p>What this means is that when we hyperventilate,</p>
<p>because we aren&rsquo;t retaining enough carbon dioxide,</p>
<p>we are not getting enough oxygen</p>
<p>to the tissues that need oxygen.</p>
<p>And as a consequence of that,</p>
<p>the brain becomes hyper excitable.</p>
<p>We actually know that there&rsquo;s an increase in anxiety,</p>
<p>and we become less good,</p>
<p>less efficient at detecting things in our environment.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not processing information as well at all.</p>
<p>The noise goes up and the signal goes down.</p>
<p>Again, incredibly important set of findings.</p>
<p>I should also mention that hyperventilation is one way</p>
<p>that in the laboratory anyway,</p>
<p>or in neurosurgery units for some time,</p>
<p>physicians would evoke seizure in seizure-prone patients.</p>
<p>The reason that works is exactly the explanation</p>
<p>I just gave you.</p>
<p>Seizure is a hyper excitability of the brain,</p>
<p>not enough inhibition or suppression</p>
<p>of the overall circuitry.</p>
<p>So you get these waves or these storms</p>
<p>of electrical activity.</p>
<p>Low levels of carbon dioxide in the brain,</p>
<p>because of low levels of carbon dioxide in the blood,</p>
<p>are one of the major triggers for seizures.</p>
<p>Now, I realize that most people listening to this</p>
<p>are not epileptic, but nonetheless,</p>
<p>this brings us all back to this question</p>
<p>of what is normal healthy breathing?</p>
<p>As I mentioned before,</p>
<p>normal healthy breathing is breathing</p>
<p>about six liters of air per minute.</p>
<p>But of course, most of us don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>in terms of liters of air,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not gonna go measure our lung capacity,</p>
<p>at least most of us aren&rsquo;t gonna do that.</p>
<p>Basically, if you are taking relatively shallow breaths</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just sitting there working</p>
<p>or maybe even walking slowly,</p>
<p>again, not talking or engaging</p>
<p>in any kind of speech or eating,</p>
<p>chances are six liters of air per minute</p>
<p>is about 12 shallow-ish breaths.</p>
<p>And when I say shallow, I don&rsquo;t mean, you know,</p>
<p>breathing like a little bunny rabbit or something like that.</p>
<p>I just mean, you know, casually breathing in, out, in, out.</p>
<p>The studies that have explored the breathing patterns</p>
<p>in large populations of individuals</p>
<p>who are not suffering necessarily</p>
<p>from any one specific ailment</p>
<p>have shown that most people breathe far too much per minute,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re engaging in anywhere from 15 to 20</p>
<p>or even 30 shallow breaths per minute.</p>
<p>So they are vastly over-breathing</p>
<p>relative to how they should be breathing.</p>
<p>Now, of course, if you breathe more deeply,</p>
<p>so you take a vigorous inhale,</p>
<p>and then you expel that air,</p>
<p>well then, to get six liters of air</p>
<p>into your system per minute,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably only going to need</p>
<p>somewhere between four and six breaths</p>
<p>in order to get that six liters per minute.</p>
<p>Now, the total time that it takes</p>
<p>to do that inhale and exhale isn&rsquo;t that much longer</p>
<p>than a kind of shallow breath,</p>
<p>provided you&rsquo;re not deliberately breathing quickly</p>
<p>during those shallow breaths.</p>
<p>So then you say, well,</p>
<p>how is it that normal healthy breathing</p>
<p>that delivers the appropriate amount of carbon dioxide</p>
<p>into the system and doesn&rsquo;t expel,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t exhale too much carbon dioxide?</p>
<p>You know, how are we supposed to do that normal breathing?</p>
<p>Right, are you supposed to breathe four times</p>
<p>and then hold your breath until the minute passes?</p>
<p>No, what you find is that the correct pattern of breathing</p>
<p>is going to involve two things.</p>
<p>First of all, nasal breathing,</p>
<p>because of the resistance it provides through the nose</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>is going to deliver more oxygen into your system.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be able to generate more air pressure</p>
<p>to fill your lungs.</p>
<p>That greater air pressure</p>
<p>is going to take longer to exhale.</p>
<p>So already we&rsquo;re increasing the amount of time</p>
<p>that each breath is going to take.</p>
<p>And also what you find is that people that are breathing</p>
<p>in the proper healthy manner,</p>
<p>that is that are balancing oxygen and carbon dioxide</p>
<p>in the proper ways,</p>
<p>are also taking pauses between breaths.</p>
<p>This is extremely important</p>
<p>because even though we have a brain center,</p>
<p>the pre-Botzinger complex that can control,</p>
<p>or I should say does control inhale,</p>
<p>exhale, rhythmic breathing,</p>
<p>those pauses between breaths are not always present.</p>
<p>In fact, often are not present</p>
<p>from people&rsquo;s baseline breathing patterns.</p>
<p>And as a consequence, they over-breathe.</p>
<p>And as I told you before, when people over-breathe,</p>
<p>their brain becomes hyper excitable</p>
<p>at the level of the background noise,</p>
<p>and yet they are less efficient</p>
<p>at detecting and learning information.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll get into the specific studies</p>
<p>that really illustrate the learning aspect a bit later,</p>
<p>but they are less efficient at detecting</p>
<p>and learning information at focusing and so on</p>
<p>as a consequence of this over-breathing</p>
<p>and the hyper excitability that causes.</p>
<p>Now, of course, that&rsquo;s also just emphasizing</p>
<p>the effects of over-breathing</p>
<p>and lack of carbon dioxide on the brain.</p>
<p>There are hundreds, if not thousands of studies</p>
<p>showing that when we don&rsquo;t have enough carbon dioxide</p>
<p>in the tissues of our body,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also problematic for all the tissues,</p>
<p>the liver, the lungs themselves, the stomach, et cetera,</p>
<p>that relate largely to shifts in pH</p>
<p>because of the fact that carbon dioxide</p>
<p>strongly regulates the acidity, alkalinity of the blood</p>
<p>and the tissues that that blood supplies nutrients to,</p>
<p>including carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>So the basic takeaway here is</p>
<p>you want to breathe in a healthy manner at rest.</p>
<p>And the best way to do that is to spend some time,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t take much,</p>
<p>maybe a minute or so each day,</p>
<p>paying attention to how quickly you are breathing per minute</p>
<p>when you are simply at rest,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re making coffee in the morning,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re sitting down to read,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re on social media.</p>
<p>Chronically holding your breath isn&rsquo;t good,</p>
<p>but neither is over-breathing.</p>
<p>And again, every study that has examined</p>
<p>the typical patterns of breathing</p>
<p>and patterns of breathing that show up as normal</p>
<p>and abnormal has found that more often than not,</p>
<p>during the nighttime, people are under-breathing,</p>
<p>and in the daytime, they are over-breathing,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re hyperventilating.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to just take a brief moment</p>
<p>and thank one of our podcast sponsors,</p>
<p>which is InsideTracker.</p>
<p>InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform</p>
<p>that analyzes data from your blood and DNA</p>
<p>to help you better understand your body</p>
<p>and help you reach your health goals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been a believer</p>
<p>in getting regular blood work done</p>
<p>for the simple reason that blood work</p>
<p>is the only way that you can monitor the markers,</p>
<p>such as hormone markers, lipids,</p>
<p>metabolic factors, et cetera,</p>
<p>that impact your immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>One major challenge with blood work, however,</p>
<p>is that most of the time,</p>
<p>it does not come back with any information</p>
<p>about what to do in order to move the values</p>
<p>for hormones, metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,</p>
<p>into the ranges that you want.</p>
<p>With InsideTracker, changing those values</p>
<p>becomes very straightforward</p>
<p>because it has a personalized dashboard that you can use</p>
<p>to address the nutrition-based, behavior-based,</p>
<p>supplement-based approaches that you can use</p>
<p>in order to move those values into the ranges</p>
<p>that are optimal for you, your vitality,</p>
<p>and your longevity.</p>
<p>InsideTracker now includes a measurement</p>
<p>of apolipoprotein B, so-called ApoB,</p>
<p>in their ultimate plan.</p>
<p>ApoB is a key marker of cardiovascular health,</p>
<p>and therefore, there&rsquo;s extreme value</p>
<p>to knowing your ApoB levels.</p>

<p>Again, that&rsquo;s insidetracker.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get 20% off.</p>
<p>So next, I&rsquo;d like to address what you can do</p>
<p>about your normal patterns of breathing.</p>
<p>That is, how you or anyone can adjust</p>
<p>their normal patterns of breathing</p>
<p>from an unhealthy to an unhealthy state.</p>
<p>But the first thing we have to do, of course,</p>
<p>is determine whether or not you&rsquo;re already breathing</p>
<p>in an unhealthy or in a healthy way.</p>
<p>And again, when I say healthy or unhealthy,</p>
<p>I mean, are you over-breathing?</p>
<p>Are you under-breathing?</p>
<p>Are you delivering the appropriate ratios</p>
<p>of oxygen and carbon dioxide</p>
<p>to the tissues of your brain and body?</p>
<p>In order to do this, we&rsquo;re going to do a simple test.</p>
<p>Again, please don&rsquo;t do this while driving</p>
<p>or operating heavy machinery or near water of any kind.</p>
<p>But assuming that you&rsquo;re not doing any of those things,</p>
<p>I encourage you to sit down,</p>
<p>certainly not lie down, but just sit down.</p>
<p>I suppose you also could do it standing.</p>
<p>And we are going to do what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>the carbon dioxide tolerance test.</p>
<p>The carbon dioxide tolerance test</p>
<p>is a sort of back-of-the-envelope measure</p>
<p>of how well you are managing carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>That is, how well you can control your breathing</p>
<p>at both the mechanical and the chemical level.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very simple test.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re going to do is,</p>
<p>for the next 10 seconds or so while I&rsquo;m speaking,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just going to breathe normally.</p>
<p>Now, again and again throughout this episode,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to encourage you</p>
<p>to be a nasal breather whenever possible.</p>
<p>But of course, there are instances</p>
<p>in which you want to engage mouth breathing.</p>
<p>But for the time being, as I continue to blab on</p>
<p>for the next few seconds, just inhale through your nose,</p>
<p>exhale through your nose.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to deliberately slow your breathing</p>
<p>or increase the cadence of your breathing.</p>
<p>However, in that time, you&rsquo;re also going to want to find</p>
<p>some sort of time-measuring device,</p>
<p>like it could be your phone or it could be a stopwatch.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m going to ask you to do in a few minutes</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;m going to ask you to inhale through your nose</p>
<p>as deeply as you possibly can.</p>
<p>That is, you&rsquo;re going to fill your lungs</p>
<p>as much as you can through your nose,</p>
<p>and then start a timer and measure how long it takes</p>
<p>for you to deliberately control that exhale</p>
<p>until your lungs are empty, okay?</p>
<p>So this is going to be a controlled exhale through the nose</p>
<p>after a big, deep breath.</p>
<p>But for the time being,</p>
<p>keep breathing at a kind of calm, regular cadence, okay?</p>
<p>So you can find that time-measuring device now,</p>
<p>or you can come back to it later if you like.</p>
<p>When I say inhale, you&rsquo;re going to inhale as deeply</p>
<p>as you can through your nose,</p>
<p>remembering that the diaphragm can really help you here</p>
<p>to get a deep inhale by having your belly move out</p>
<p>while you inhale.</p>
<p>And then when I say start,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to measure the time that it takes</p>
<p>to do a complete lungs-empty exhale.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;ll measure it for you.</p>
<p>This will be one of the rare instances in this podcast</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s going to be a long period of silence</p>
<p>as I measure something.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve got a stopwatch here.</p>
<p>So please prepare to do the big inhale</p>
<p>and start inhaling now.</p>
<p>So inhale as deeply as you can through your nose,</p>
<p>fill your lungs as much as you can, okay?</p>
<p>Now, start, meaning slowly control the exhale</p>
<p>through your nose.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to let that air out as slowly as possible.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just going to call out every 10 or 15 seconds or so.</p>
<p>And you want to note when your lungs are empty.</p>
<p>I know you can hold your breath with your lungs empty.</p>
<p>That is not an accurate measure, 15 seconds.</p>
<p>It is important that you know when your lungs are empty</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re trying to control the exhale</p>
<p>as much as possible so that you don&rsquo;t arrive</p>
<p>at that lungs-empty time too quickly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explain what too quickly means, 30 seconds, okay?</p>
<p>For those of you that have already reached lungs-empty,</p>
<p>please go back to breathing normally.</p>
<p>For those of you that haven&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you can hang in here a little longer.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re still discarding that air, 45 seconds.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re rounding toward a minute, not quite there.</p>
<p>Some of you are probably still letting out that air.</p>
<p>I want to point out none of this has to do</p>
<p>with cardiovascular fitness level,</p>
<p>at least not in any kind of direct way.</p>
<p>And 60 seconds.</p>
<p>And I realize there will be a small subset of you out there</p>
<p>that are still exhaling your air in a slow lungs,</p>
<p>slow exhale manner through the nose.</p>
<p>Okay, so what we just did is a back of the envelope</p>
<p>carbon dioxide discard rate, okay?</p>
<p>If you need to pause this and go back and try it again,</p>
<p>you just want to time how long it takes you</p>
<p>to go from lungs full to lungs empty.</p>
<p>Again, with the full understanding,</p>
<p>I know that you can all sit there like beasts</p>
<p>and hold your breath with your lungs empty,</p>
<p>but please don&rsquo;t do that because that&rsquo;s not going</p>
<p>to be informative for what I&rsquo;m telling you now.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m going to tell you now is that if it took you</p>
<p>20 seconds or less to expel all your air,</p>
<p>that is you couldn&rsquo;t extend that exhale</p>
<p>longer than 20 seconds,</p>
<p>in a kind of back of the envelope way,</p>
<p>we can say that you have a relatively brief</p>
<p>or low carbon dioxide tolerance, okay?</p>
<p>If it took you somewhere between 25 and 40,</p>
<p>maybe 45 seconds to expel all your air,</p>
<p>that is you could control that exhale</p>
<p>for about 45 seconds or 30 seconds,</p>
<p>then you have a moderate level of carbon dioxide tolerance.</p>
<p>And if for instance, you were able to go 50 seconds</p>
<p>or longer for that discard until you hit lungs empty,</p>
<p>you have a fairly high degree of carbon dioxide tolerance.</p>
<p>Now, here&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>If you had low carbon dioxide tolerance,</p>
<p>that is your 20 seconds or less,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to write down the number three, okay?</p>
<p>If you had moderate levels of carbon dioxide tolerance,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to write down the number five</p>
<p>or you could even put five to six.</p>
<p>And then if you are in that bracket of people</p>
<p>that was able to discard your air over a period</p>
<p>of 50 seconds or more,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to write down the number eight to 10, okay?</p>
<p>Now, what are these numbers?</p>
<p>What are we talking about?</p>
<p>And before we get into what to do with these numbers,</p>
<p>I want to emphasize again,</p>
<p>this does not have to do with fitness level per se.</p>
<p>I know some world-class triathletes</p>
<p>that have very fast carbon dioxide blow off times.</p>
<p>That is their discard rates are 20 seconds or less.</p>
<p>I should also point out that if you&rsquo;re very stressed,</p>
<p>that number is going to be very small.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re very relaxed,</p>
<p>like you just woke up after a long night of sleep</p>
<p>and you feel great,</p>
<p>that number is going to be extended, okay?</p>
<p>So this is a back of the envelope measure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to use each time you decide</p>
<p>to do the exercise I&rsquo;m going to tell you about in a moment.</p>
<p>And the exercise I&rsquo;m going to tell you about in a moment</p>
<p>can be done every day if you like.</p>
<p>But what the most interesting studies,</p>
<p>at least to me,</p>
<p>indicate is that you could do the exercise</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you about even just once or twice a week</p>
<p>and greatly improve your efficiency of breathing</p>
<p>and shift yourself away from over-breathing when at rest,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re not thinking</p>
<p>about how you&rsquo;re breathing at rest.</p>
<p>Okay, so what is this exercise?</p>
<p>Well, you just got your number,</p>
<p>either low, medium, or high bracket number</p>
<p>for carbon dioxide discard rate.</p>
<p>Remember, if you&rsquo;re in the low category,</p>
<p>your number is three.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re medium, it&rsquo;s five to six.</p>
<p>And if you are in the long carbon dioxide discard rate,</p>
<p>long duration carbon dioxide discard rate,</p>
<p>that is eight to 10 is your number.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re going to do two minutes</p>
<p>of what most people would call box breathing.</p>
<p>What is box breathing?</p>
<p>Box breathing are equal duration, inhale, hold,</p>
<p>exhale, hold, repeat.</p>
<p>So inhale, hold, exhale, hold.</p>
<p>Sounds very easy, right?</p>
<p>How long do you inhale and then hold,</p>
<p>exhale, and then hold?</p>
<p>Well, you now know.</p>
<p>If you were in the low group of carbon dioxide discard rate,</p>
<p>your inhale is going to be three seconds,</p>
<p>your hold will be three seconds,</p>
<p>your exhale will be three seconds,</p>
<p>and then you repeat three seconds.</p>
<p>So each sides of the box, if you will,</p>
<p>is going to be three seconds long.</p>
<p>If you were in the moderate carbon dioxide</p>
<p>discard rate category,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re going to inhale for five to six seconds,</p>
<p>hold for five to six, exhale for five to six,</p>
<p>hold for five to six, repeat for about two minutes.</p>
<p>You could do three minutes if you want,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s important to have protocols</p>
<p>that are feasible for most people.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to mean doing things</p>
<p>for about two to five minutes</p>
<p>when it comes to these breath rehabilitation exercises</p>
<p>for restoring normal breathing.</p>
<p>And then of course, if you were in the long category</p>
<p>of carbon dioxide discard rate,</p>
<p>you should be able to do an eight to 10 second inhale,</p>
<p>eight to 10 second hold, eight to 10 second exhale,</p>
<p>eight to 10 second hold, and repeat, okay?</p>
<p>So you could do that exercise now if you like,</p>
<p>or you could do it at some point offline.</p>
<p>You can pause this podcast if you want and go try it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an exercise that you can do</p>
<p>for about two to three minutes, once or twice per week.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happening when you do that exercise?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, you are greatly increasing</p>
<p>your neural mechanical control over the diaphragm.</p>
<p>This is very important.</p>
<p>Most people are not aware of this phrenic nerve pathway</p>
<p>in the diaphragm, and you&rsquo;re greatly increasing</p>
<p>your mechanical control over this pathway</p>
<p>through the process we call neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>When you deliberately focus on a aspect</p>
<p>of your nervous system control,</p>
<p>in particular nervous system control over musculature</p>
<p>that normally is subconscious</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not paying attention to,</p>
<p>when you actively take control of that,</p>
<p>it requires that your brain adjust and rewire</p>
<p>the relationship between the different components</p>
<p>of that circuit.</p>
<p>And the wonderful thing is that has been shown</p>
<p>to lead to changes in your resting pattern of breathing.</p>
<p>Now, why did we go through the whole business</p>
<p>of doing the carbon dioxide tolerance test?</p>
<p>Well, for people who don&rsquo;t tolerate carbon dioxide</p>
<p>very well, they don&rsquo;t have very good phrenic,</p>
<p>that is neuromechanical control of the diaphragm,</p>
<p>for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Again, it doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re not fit.</p>
<p>It just means you don&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>or you have not yet developed</p>
<p>neuromechanical control of the diaphragm.</p>
<p>It would be near impossible for you to do box breathing</p>
<p>for two or three minutes with eight seconds in,</p>
<p>eight seconds hold, eight seconds exhale, eight second hold.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why we do a test</p>
<p>to see what you&rsquo;re capable of doing.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want the box breathing to be too strained</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re really challenged to get around the whole box.</p>
<p>You want it to be relatively easy</p>
<p>because remember you&rsquo;re trying to translate this pattern</p>
<p>to your normal pattern of breathing.</p>
<p>That is your pattern of breathing</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re not consciously thinking about breathing.</p>
<p>And what are we really translating</p>
<p>when we do this box breathing type exercise?</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re translating is the ability</p>
<p>to pause between breaths and yet take full,</p>
<p>mechanically driven breaths</p>
<p>that involve the phrenic nerve and diaphragm.</p>
<p>So again, you&rsquo;re encouraging,</p>
<p>especially if you use nasal breathing</p>
<p>when you do the box breathing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re encouraging phrenic control over the diaphragm</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re getting that six liters of air per minute or so</p>
<p>using fewer and fewer breaths over time.</p>
<p>So this is a, again, zero cost,</p>
<p>although it does cost a little bit of time,</p>
<p>zero cost approach to adjusting your normal pattern</p>
<p>of breathing at rest,</p>
<p>which has a huge number of positive outcomes</p>
<p>in terms of your ability to stay relatively calm,</p>
<p>to not get the hyperexcitability of the brain.</p>
<p>It has actually been shown in various studies,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll talk about one in particular later,</p>
<p>to greatly improve not just levels of calm</p>
<p>and reduce bouts of stress,</p>
<p>but also improve nighttime sleep.</p>
<p>There are a huge number of benefits</p>
<p>that can come from doing this box breathing exercise,</p>
<p>but you got to get the duration</p>
<p>of the sides of the box right,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why you do the carbon dioxide tolerance test.</p>
<p>One thing that many people notice</p>
<p>after doing the carbon dioxide tolerance test,</p>
<p>even just once,</p>
<p>and then doing this box breathing exercise</p>
<p>once or twice a week,</p>
<p>is that after two or three weeks,</p>
<p>the box breathing itself becomes very easy.</p>
<p>And in that case,</p>
<p>I recommend taking the carbon dioxide tolerance test</p>
<p>over again,</p>
<p>and almost always what you&rsquo;ll find</p>
<p>is that you have been able to extend</p>
<p>your carbon dioxide discard rate,</p>
<p>and therefore you now fall into a different category,</p>
<p>not just the lower medium,</p>
<p>but the long carbon dioxide discard rate category,</p>
<p>and you are able to extend the duration</p>
<p>of those inhale hold, exhale holds</p>
<p>during the box breathing.</p>
<p>And of course,</p>
<p>the ultimate benefit of all this</p>
<p>is that it translates to deeper</p>
<p>and yet less frequent breathing</p>
<p>when at rest and when not consciously paying attention</p>
<p>to how you&rsquo;re breathing during the daytime.</p>
<p>Again, if at all possible,</p>
<p>do all of this breathing through the nose.</p>
<p>For those of you that have a severely occluded nose,</p>
<p>the recommendation always is to breathe</p>
<p>through your nose more,</p>
<p>but I do realize that for some people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really uncomfortable to breathe through the nose</p>
<p>because they have such an occluded nasal pathway.</p>
<p>And for you folks,</p>
<p>doing some of this breathing through the mouth</p>
<p>can probably suffice,</p>
<p>but if at all possible,</p>
<p>do the breathing through the nose.</p>
<p>And please also let me know how your progress</p>
<p>evolves over time with the carbon dioxide discard rate</p>
<p>and the box breathing.</p>
<p>And of course,</p>
<p>the positive shifts that occur</p>
<p>in normal unconscious daytime breathing</p>
<p>translate to all the opposite things</p>
<p>that we talked about when you are over breathing</p>
<p>during the daytime.</p>
<p>So what I just described</p>
<p>in terms of the carbon dioxide tolerance test</p>
<p>and the exercise using box breathing</p>
<p>to restore normal patterns of breathing</p>
<p>and not over breathe</p>
<p>and therefore not eliminate too much carbon dioxide</p>
<p>is exactly the two tests</p>
<p>that were incorporated into a study</p>
<p>that my laboratory did in collaboration</p>
<p>with our associate chair of psychiatry</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine, Dr. David Spiegel,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s also been a guest on this podcast previously.</p>
<p>And that study explored box breathing,</p>
<p>but it also explored other forms of breathing</p>
<p>and actually compared those forms of deliberate breathing</p>
<p>to meditation as a means to explore</p>
<p>what are going to be the minimal effective doses</p>
<p>and most effective ways</p>
<p>to chronically reduce stress around the clock</p>
<p>and improve mood and improve sleep.</p>
<p>So the study I&rsquo;m referring to was just published recently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s entitled,</p>
<p>Brief Structured Respiration Practices,</p>
<p>Enhance Mood and Reduce Physiological Arousal.</p>
<p>We will also provide a link to this paper</p>
<p>in the show note captions.</p>
<p>What this study really focused on was a simple question,</p>
<p>which is what is the shortest and most effective practice</p>
<p>that people can use in order to reduce their levels</p>
<p>of stress, not just during that breath work practice</p>
<p>or meditation practice, but around the clock,</p>
<p>24 hours a day, including improvements in sleep.</p>
<p>And we were excited to do this study</p>
<p>because many studies had explored how meditation</p>
<p>or in some cases, fewer studies had explored</p>
<p>how breath work can impact different brain states</p>
<p>or bodily states.</p>
<p>But very few studies had explored how those breath work</p>
<p>or meditation practices influenced body brain states</p>
<p>around the clock when people were not performing</p>
<p>the particular meditation or breath work practice.</p>
<p>The reason we were able to do this study</p>
<p>was really fortunate.</p>
<p>The folks over at WHOOP were generous enough</p>
<p>to donate a bunch of WHOOP straps,</p>
<p>which allowed us to measure heart rate variability,</p>
<p>a number of other different physiological parameters.</p>
<p>We also got subjective reports about people&rsquo;s mood</p>
<p>and feelings of wellbeing.</p>
<p>We got data about their sleep pinged to us</p>
<p>from remote locations.</p>
<p>So these people, rather than being brought</p>
<p>to the laboratory and being in a very artificial</p>
<p>circumstance, the laboratory, as much as we like to think</p>
<p>our laboratory is realistic, we have virtual reality</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing as realistic as the real world.</p>
<p>And so we were able to have more than 100 subjects</p>
<p>out in the real world, living their real lives,</p>
<p>pinging back to us data all the time, 24 hours a day,</p>
<p>so that we could measure how their different interventions</p>
<p>that we asked them to do, breath work practices</p>
<p>or meditation practices were impacting physiological</p>
<p>parameters and they were also informing us regularly</p>
<p>about their subjective mood, et cetera.</p>
<p>We got a lot of data, as you can imagine.</p>
<p>And the basic takeaway from the study was twofold.</p>
<p>First of all, we discovered that deliberate breath work</p>
<p>practices done for about five minutes per day</p>
<p>across the course of about a month,</p>
<p>led to greater reductions in stress</p>
<p>than did a five minute a day meditation practice.</p>
<p>Now, that is not to say that meditation is not useful.</p>
<p>In fact, there are dozens, if not hundreds of papers,</p>
<p>including one particular, I should say,</p>
<p>particularly beautiful study from Wendy Suzuki&rsquo;s lab</p>
<p>at New York University showing that a daily 10 to 13 minute</p>
<p>mindfulness meditation practice can greatly improve focus,</p>
<p>memory, and a number of other things related to cognition</p>
<p>and learning.</p>
<p>However, the research on meditation has shown us</p>
<p>that meditation, at least short meditations,</p>
<p>mainly lead to improvements in focus and memory,</p>
<p>not so much reductions in stress,</p>
<p>although they do lead to reductions in stress.</p>
<p>What we found was that any number of different breath work</p>
<p>practices, and we explored three,</p>
<p>done for five minutes a day,</p>
<p>outperformed meditation in terms of the ability of breath</p>
<p>work to reduce stress around the clock</p>
<p>compared to meditation.</p>
<p>The three types of breath work that we explored</p>
<p>also showed different effects.</p>
<p>I should mention the three types of breath work</p>
<p>that we compared were box breathing of the sort</p>
<p>that you just learned about.</p>
<p>We compared that to something called cyclic sighing,</p>
<p>which involves two inhales through the nose</p>
<p>to get maximally inflated lungs,</p>
<p>followed by a long exhale.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll return to that in a moment.</p>
<p>That was repeated for five minutes at a time</p>
<p>for each session.</p>
<p>And a third breath work practice,</p>
<p>which was cyclic hyperventilation,</p>
<p>which as the name suggests,</p>
<p>involves people inhaling deeply through the nose,</p>
<p>then exhaling passively through the mouth,</p>
<p>and then repeating inhale through the nose,</p>
<p>exhale through the mouth,</p>
<p>repeating that for 25 cycles,</p>
<p>one cycle being an inhale and an exhale.</p>
<p>So that equals one cycle,</p>
<p>repeating that for 25 cycles,</p>
<p>then exhaling all their air and holding their breath</p>
<p>with lungs empty for about 15 to 30 seconds,</p>
<p>and then repeating inhale, exhale,</p>
<p>cyclic hyperventilation for the duration of five minutes.</p>
<p>Okay, so people were divided into these different groups,</p>
<p>either mindfulness meditation where they sat,</p>
<p>they were not told to control their breathing</p>
<p>in any specific way, they closed their eyes,</p>
<p>their focus, their attention on a region</p>
<p>just behind their forehead, one group did that,</p>
<p>the other group did cyclic sighing,</p>
<p>another group did box breathing,</p>
<p>another group did cyclic hyperventilation.</p>
<p>As any sort of clinical trial like this ought to,</p>
<p>we then swapped people into different groups</p>
<p>so they served as their own control,</p>
<p>so we could evaluate any between</p>
<p>and within individual variability.</p>
<p>Again, there are a lot of data in this paper,</p>
<p>but the takeaway was that for the sake of stress reduction</p>
<p>around the clock, and for the sake of improving sleep</p>
<p>and mood, the most effective practice</p>
<p>of the four practices that we examined</p>
<p>was the cyclic sighing.</p>
<p>Again, cyclic sighing is performed the following way,</p>
<p>you inhale through the nose as deeply as you can,</p>
<p>then you do a second inhale immediately afterwards</p>
<p>to try and maximally inflate the lungs,</p>
<p>in fact, that&rsquo;s what happens,</p>
<p>we know that during that second inhale,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s just a very sharp, short inhale,</p>
<p>the extra physical vigor that&rsquo;s required</p>
<p>to generate that second inhale</p>
<p>causes those avioli of the lungs, which may have collapsed,</p>
<p>and indeed in between breaths,</p>
<p>and often even just through the course of the day,</p>
<p>and especially if we get stressed,</p>
<p>those avioli of the lungs start to collapse,</p>
<p>and because they&rsquo;re damp on the inside,</p>
<p>they have a little bit of fluid,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like a balloon with a little bit of fluid</p>
<p>in the middle, it takes a little bit of physical force</p>
<p>to pop those open, now you&rsquo;re not literally exploding</p>
<p>them pop, but you&rsquo;re reinflating them with air,</p>
<p>and then you perform the long exhale through the mouth</p>
<p>until lungs are empty, so it looks exactly like this.</p>
<p>Now, we know that one single physiological sigh</p>
<p>of the sort that I just described,</p>
<p>performed at any time of day, under any conditions,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re about to walk on stage to give a talk,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re in a meeting and you&rsquo;re feeling stressed,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re in a conversation that&rsquo;s very stressful,</p>
<p>or you can feel stress mounting because you&rsquo;re in traffic,</p>
<p>or any number of psychological or physical stressors</p>
<p>that may be approaching you or you feel are oppressing you,</p>
<p>doing one physiological sigh of the sort</p>
<p>that I just described is the fastest physiologically</p>
<p>verified way that we are aware of to reduce your levels</p>
<p>of stress and to reintroduce calm,</p>
<p>that is to shift your autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>from a state of heightened levels of autonomic arousal,</p>
<p>that is sympathetic nervous system, as it&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>is at a higher activation level</p>
<p>than the so-called parasympathetic nervous system.</p>
<p>Again, sympathetic nervous system,</p>
<p>having nothing to do with sympathy,</p>
<p>has everything to do with so-called fight or flight,</p>
<p>although it controls other things too,</p>
<p>including positive arousal.</p>
<p>And the parasympathetic nervous system,</p>
<p>often referred to as the rest and digest system,</p>
<p>although it does other things too,</p>
<p>is associated with calming.</p>
<p>Those two things are always in kind of push-pull</p>
<p>with one another, like a seesaw or push-pull,</p>
<p>however you want to think about it.</p>
<p>One physiological sigh, meaning that big deep inhale,</p>
<p>short second inhale, also through the nose,</p>
<p>and then long exhale to completely lungs empty,</p>
<p>is known to restore the level of balance</p>
<p>in the sympathetic parasympathetic neural circuitries,</p>
<p>and is the fastest way to reintroduce calm.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one physiological sigh.</p>
<p>In this study, what we asked was that people perform</p>
<p>that repeatedly, so-called cyclic sighing,</p>
<p>for the duration of five minutes.</p>
<p>And the people who did that cyclic sighing</p>
<p>for five minutes a day,</p>
<p>regardless of the time of day that they did it,</p>
<p>experienced the greatest reductions in stress,</p>
<p>not just during the practice,</p>
<p>but around the 24-hour cycle.</p>
<p>And it translated, again,</p>
<p>to all sorts of positive subjective changes,</p>
<p>improvements in sleep.</p>
<p>Lower resting heart rate at all times of day.</p>
<p>So this is important.</p>
<p>Again, this study was not just exploring</p>
<p>what happens during meditation or breath work,</p>
<p>cyclic sighing, et cetera.</p>
<p>It was exploring how the changes that occur</p>
<p>during that practice translate to changes in breathing</p>
<p>and heart rate, mood, et cetera,</p>
<p>throughout the 24-hour cycle.</p>
<p>So the takeaway here is twofold.</p>
<p>First of all, if you&rsquo;re somebody who wants</p>
<p>to improve your mood and reduce your overall levels</p>
<p>of stress, and you only have five minutes a day</p>
<p>to invest in that,</p>
<p>hopefully you&rsquo;re doing all the other things</p>
<p>like trying to get proper sleep and exercise,</p>
<p>social connection, nutrition, et cetera,</p>
<p>sunlight in the morning, of course.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t leave that out.</p>
<p>But if you were going to devote five minutes a day</p>
<p>to a stress reduction practice</p>
<p>that is now supported by data to translate</p>
<p>to reductions in stress around the clock,</p>
<p>the data say that you would want to invest that</p>
<p>in cyclic sighing, that is double inhale through the nose,</p>
<p>extended exhale through the mouth</p>
<p>until your lungs are empty,</p>
<p>then repeat for five minutes a day.</p>
<p>You, of course, if you like, could do meditation.</p>
<p>It still had positive effects, meaning it reduced stress,</p>
<p>although not as much as cyclic sighing.</p>
<p>You could do box breathing if you want</p>
<p>for the purpose of reducing stress.</p>
<p>All the practices we explored did reduce stress,</p>
<p>but cyclic sighing performed for five minutes a day</p>
<p>had the most robust and pervasive effect</p>
<p>in reducing stress, improving mood, and improving sleep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first message of the study.</p>
<p>The second takeaway is that one physiological sigh,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right, just one physiological sigh</p>
<p>where you inhale deeply through the nose,</p>
<p>another inhale through the nose</p>
<p>to maximally inflate the alveoli of the lungs,</p>
<p>and then you exhale to completely lungs empty,</p>
<p>and then go back to normal breathing</p>
<p>is the fastest way to introduce a level of calm</p>
<p>and to reduce your overall levels of stress in real time.</p>
<p>And this is very important.</p>
<p>I think that out there these days,</p>
<p>we hear a lot about stress reduction techniques,</p>
<p>and most all of the stress reduction techniques</p>
<p>that have been explored,</p>
<p>everything from massage to meditation to breath work</p>
<p>to a hot shower to a foot rub will calm you down.</p>
<p>The question is, do they calm you down</p>
<p>just during that practice?</p>
<p>Great if it does, but does it also translate</p>
<p>to reduce levels of stress at other times</p>
<p>in the 24-hour cycle and other positive effects as well?</p>
<p>So one physiological sigh is a very efficient way</p>
<p>to adjust that ratio of sympathetic</p>
<p>to parasympathetic activation</p>
<p>and immediately bring about calm.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s excellent for real-time control of stress.</p>
<p>The other thing about physiological sighs</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s not a hack.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the application of a breathing practice</p>
<p>to something that it wasn&rsquo;t intended for.</p>
<p>In fact, physiological sighs were not discovered by me</p>
<p>at all.</p>
<p>They were discovered by physiologists in the 1930s</p>
<p>who found that when people under breathe,</p>
<p>they have a buildup of carbon dioxide in their system.</p>
<p>And even though carbon dioxide is essential for life,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want too much of it in your system.</p>
<p>And that people, whether or not they were asleep or awake,</p>
<p>would engage a physiological sigh spontaneously,</p>
<p>subconsciously.</p>
<p>They would do this double inhale through the nose</p>
<p>and extended exhale through the mouth.</p>
<p>And that did not just eliminate excessive carbon dioxide</p>
<p>from the system.</p>
<p>It also rebalanced the oxygen carbon dioxide ratio</p>
<p>in the proper ways.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s observed in animals.</p>
<p>You might see this in animals that are tired.</p>
<p>When animals or humans get tired,</p>
<p>they tend to start under breathing a little bit.</p>
<p>And that can often disrupt the balance</p>
<p>of carbon dioxide and oxygen.</p>
<p>And right before a dog will go down for a nap,</p>
<p>for instance, you&rsquo;ll notice</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;ll do this double inhale exhale.</p>
<p>People, when they are sleeping,</p>
<p>if they hold their breath for a period of time,</p>
<p>which frankly all of us do periodically throughout sleep,</p>
<p>they will engage a spontaneous physiological sigh.</p>
<p>During the daytime, we are often holding our breath,</p>
<p>especially nowadays.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a study on this</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll talk about a little bit later</p>
<p>where when people text message or they&rsquo;re emailing,</p>
<p>although nowadays people are mainly on social media</p>
<p>and text messaging, they often are holding their breath.</p>
<p>They will follow a breath hold by a physiological sigh</p>
<p>because during that breath hold,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re building up the level of carbon dioxide</p>
<p>in their system.</p>
<p>Now, mind you, I spent close to a half an hour telling you</p>
<p>that most people are over-breathing at rest.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also true.</p>
<p>But people often will shift from over-breathing</p>
<p>to under-breathing, which is a terrible pattern.</p>
<p>So physiological sighs done either as a one-off,</p>
<p>one physiological sigh to clamp stress</p>
<p>or reduce stress in real time,</p>
<p>or repeatedly over five minutes</p>
<p>as a practice that you do each day</p>
<p>is going to be not just the most effective way</p>
<p>to approach reducing stress around the clock</p>
<p>and in real time,</p>
<p>but also the one that&rsquo;s highly compatible</p>
<p>with the way that the neural circuits</p>
<p>that control breathing were designed.</p>
<p>The physiological sigh</p>
<p>has some other very useful applications.</p>
<p>One of the more, I would say useful ones,</p>
<p>at least to those of you that exercise</p>
<p>is going to be the use of physiological sigh</p>
<p>in order to remove the so-called side stitch.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve ever been running or swimming or exercising,</p>
<p>you felt a cramp on your right side,</p>
<p>chances are, despite what your high school PE coach told you</p>
<p>that raising your arms above your head</p>
<p>or drinking less water before you exercise</p>
<p>is not going to get rid of that cramp.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s why, it&rsquo;s not a cramp at all.</p>
<p>If you recall the cervical three, four, and five nerves</p>
<p>that give rise to the phrenic nerve</p>
<p>and go down and innervate your diaphragm,</p>
<p>well, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>a certain number of those nerve fibers</p>
<p>actually course into the diaphragm and go up underneath.</p>
<p>And if you recall earlier,</p>
<p>I also said that the diaphragm</p>
<p>sits right on top of the liver.</p>
<p>In other words, you actually have a sensory innervation</p>
<p>of the diaphragm, the deep diaphragm,</p>
<p>and the liver.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something called referenced pain,</p>
<p>which is what people generally experience</p>
<p>when they have that side stitch on their right-hand side.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re ever exercising</p>
<p>and you feel a cramp on your right-hand side,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible that it&rsquo;s a genuine cramp,</p>
<p>but more likely is the fact</p>
<p>that that phrenic nerve sensory innervation</p>
<p>is now being carried up to your brain</p>
<p>and you are detecting some local or referenced pain</p>
<p>in the liver and in the diaphragm.</p>
<p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing anything wrong,</p>
<p>although you might not be breathing properly</p>
<p>for running at that moment.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what gave rise to it.</p>
<p>It could be some spasming of the phrenic nerve</p>
<p>or some inefficient breathing during running.</p>
<p>We had an entire series on fitness with Dr. Andy Galpin.</p>
<p>One of those episodes</p>
<p>included a lot of information on breathing.</p>
<p>It was the episode on endurance,</p>
<p>although breathing was a topic</p>
<p>that was thread through multiple episodes in that series.</p>
<p>You can find that series at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>It talks a lot about how to breathe during running,</p>
<p>how to breathe during weightlifting, et cetera.</p>
<p>But the point for now is that</p>
<p>if ever you&rsquo;re experiencing that right side side stitch,</p>
<p>I encourage you to perform the physiological sigh.</p>
<p>And the good news is you can perform it</p>
<p>while still running or while still swimming.</p>
<p>Although I suppose with swimming,</p>
<p>you might have to make some adjustments</p>
<p>because of course you don&rsquo;t want to inhale water</p>
<p>or while cycling or any type of activity.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d perform that physiological sigh,</p>
<p>generally two or three times,</p>
<p>what will occur is that because of changes</p>
<p>in the firing of the phrenic nerve,</p>
<p>and in particular because of changes in the sensory feedback</p>
<p>from the sensory component of the phrenic nerve</p>
<p>back to the brain,</p>
<p>you will experience an alleviation of the pain</p>
<p>from that right side side stitch.</p>
<p>In other words, you can get rid of side cramps</p>
<p>doing physiological sighs during activities,</p>
<p>in particular during running activities.</p>
<p>Now, I should also mention that if you&rsquo;re experiencing</p>
<p>a side stitch on the left side,</p>
<p>chances are that has to do with excessive air</p>
<p>or fluid in your stomach.</p>
<p>And there are reasons for that</p>
<p>that also have to do with the way that the phrenic nerve</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s bilateral and branches to both sides</p>
<p>and is catching sensory input on the left side</p>
<p>from some of the local organs</p>
<p>and sensory innervation of those organs.</p>
<p>But if you have right side side stitch,</p>
<p>the physiological sigh done two or three times</p>
<p>while still running ought to relieve that side stitch.</p>
<p>Now, as long as we&rsquo;re talking about breathing</p>
<p>and the phrenic nerve and the relationship</p>
<p>between the phrenic nerve and your liver and your stomach</p>
<p>and some of the other organs in that neighborhood,</p>
<p>we should talk about the relationship</p>
<p>between breathing and heart rate.</p>
<p>This is an incredibly important topic,</p>
<p>so much so that I perhaps should have brought it up</p>
<p>at the beginning of the episode,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, you now know what your diaphragm does,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>When you inhale, your diaphragm moves down.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>When you contract your diaphragm, it moves down.</p>
<p>It creates space for your lungs to inhale.</p>
<p>And when you exhale, your diaphragm moves up.</p>
<p>Well, when you inhale and your diaphragm moves down,</p>
<p>what happens is there&rsquo;s more space created</p>
<p>in the thoracic cavity,</p>
<p>in particular, if you&rsquo;re also breathing deeply</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re using those intracostal muscles</p>
<p>to expand your ribs.</p>
<p>As a consequence, the heart actually gets</p>
<p>a little bit bigger.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a temporary enlargement in the heart,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a real enlargement.</p>
<p>And as a consequence, whatever blood is in the heart</p>
<p>is now in a larger volume because the heart got bigger.</p>
<p>And as a consequence, that blood is moving more slowly</p>
<p>through that larger volume for a short period of time,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, it&rsquo;s moving more slowly.</p>
<p>Your nervous system detects that</p>
<p>and sends a neural signal to the heart</p>
<p>to speed the heart rate up.</p>
<p>In other words, inhales increase heart rate.</p>
<p>The opposite is true when you exhale.</p>
<p>When you exhale, your diaphragm moves up.</p>
<p>Your rib cage tends to move inward a bit</p>
<p>and you compact the heart.</p>
<p>You reduce the volume of the heart overall.</p>
<p>When you reduce the volume of the heart overall,</p>
<p>blood flow through the heart accelerates</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a smaller volume.</p>
<p>So given unit of blood is going to move more quickly</p>
<p>through that small volume.</p>
<p>Your nervous system detects that</p>
<p>and sends a signal to slow the heart down.</p>
<p>So just as inhales speed the heart up,</p>
<p>exhales slow your heart rate down.</p>
<p>Now, of course, even though you can double up on inhales</p>
<p>or even triple up on inhales,</p>
<p>sooner or later, if you inhale,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to exhale, all right?</p>
<p>And the converse is also true, of course.</p>
<p>So what does this mean in terms</p>
<p>of controlling your heart rate?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s say you are going in for a blood draw</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re going out on stage and you&rsquo;re stressed.</p>
<p>Well, I would encourage you to do a physiological side,</p>
<p>maybe two physiological sides to bring your level of calm up</p>
<p>and your level of stress down.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, if you have any reason</p>
<p>why you want to quickly reduce your heart rate</p>
<p>or accelerate your heart rate</p>
<p>for sake of physical work output</p>
<p>or to calm yourself down additionally,</p>
<p>not just use the physiological side,</p>
<p>well, then you can take advantage of this relationship</p>
<p>between inhales and exhales controlling heart rate.</p>
<p>If you want to increase your heart rate,</p>
<p>you can simply inhale longer and more vigorously</p>
<p>relative to your exhales.</p>
<p>And if you want to decrease your heart rate,</p>
<p>well, then you&rsquo;re going to make your exhales longer</p>
<p>and or more vigorous than your inhales.</p>
<p>In fact, this process,</p>
<p>which is called respiratory sinus arrhythmia</p>
<p>is the basis of what we call heart rate variability.</p>
<p>Heart rate variability involves the vagus nerve,</p>
<p>the 10th cranial nerve, which is a parasympathetic nerve</p>
<p>that is associated with a calming aspect</p>
<p>of the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>slowing your heart rate down by extending your exhales.</p>
<p>And it really forms the basis</p>
<p>of most all breathing practices.</p>
<p>If you look at any breathing practices,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s Wim Hof breathing, Tummo breathing,</p>
<p>Kundalini breathing, Pranayama breathing,</p>
<p>physiological sighing, cyclic sighing,</p>
<p>and on and on and on.</p>
<p>If you were to measure the ratio of inhales to exhales</p>
<p>and the vigor of inhales to exhales,</p>
<p>what you would find is that each one would create</p>
<p>a net increase or a net decrease in heart rate</p>
<p>that could be very accurately predicted</p>
<p>by whether or not that breathing practice</p>
<p>emphasized inhales, emphasized exhales,</p>
<p>or had those two features inhale and exhale</p>
<p>be of equal duration and intensity.</p>
<p>In fact, if you wanted to equilibrate your heart rate,</p>
<p>what you would do is you would do box breathing</p>
<p>because inhale, hold, exhale, hold is by definition</p>
<p>creating equal duration inhales and exhales</p>
<p>of essentially equivalent vigor.</p>
<p>When you do a physiological sigh,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing two big inhales,</p>
<p>which is gonna speed your heart rate up just a little bit,</p>
<p>but then a long extended exhale.</p>
<p>The exhale in the end is much longer</p>
<p>than the two inhales even when combined.</p>
<p>And so you get a net decrease in heart rate,</p>
<p>the calming effect.</p>
<p>And then practices such as TUMO breathing</p>
<p>or Wim Hof breathing or cyclic hyperventilation,</p>
<p>deep inhales and exhales,</p>
<p>the inhales are more vigorous</p>
<p>compared to the more passive exhales</p>
<p>are going to lead to increases in heart rate.</p>
<p>Okay, so the relationship between breathing and heart rate</p>
<p>is an absolutely lockstep one</p>
<p>where your heart rate follows your breathing,</p>
<p>your heart rate and your breathing</p>
<p>are in an intimate discussion with one another,</p>
<p>but where always and forever</p>
<p>your inhales increase your heart rate,</p>
<p>your exhales decrease it.</p>
<p>Now this feature,</p>
<p>which physicians call respiratory sinus arrhythmia,</p>
<p>or we sometimes hear about more often nowadays</p>
<p>as heart rate variability</p>
<p>is something that people in sport</p>
<p>have known about for a very long time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why, for instance,</p>
<p>that marksmen will exhale just prior to taking a shot.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s particularly true</p>
<p>for people that compete in the biathlon</p>
<p>where they cross country ski.</p>
<p>So their heart rate is up, up, up, up, up.</p>
<p>Then they&rsquo;ll get to the point</p>
<p>where they actually have to shoot at a target</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll exhale</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll shoot at the target.</p>
<p>This is also why, for instance,</p>
<p>if you want to bring your heart rate down very quickly</p>
<p>between rounds of martial arts,</p>
<p>there are a number of different ways to do that,</p>
<p>but an extended exhale of any kind,</p>
<p>or frankly, any breathing practice that emphasizes exhales</p>
<p>is going to bring your heart rate down.</p>
<p>This has been incorporated</p>
<p>in a number of different contexts,</p>
<p>including sport, military.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also now being incorporated in the clinical context</p>
<p>for people who feel a panic attack coming on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very gratified to learn that the physiological sigh</p>
<p>is now being explored as a tool</p>
<p>to prevent panic attacks and anxiety attacks.</p>
<p>This is prior to the panic attack,</p>
<p>people bringing their heart rate down again</p>
<p>through those extended exhales.</p>
<p>So learning to extend your exhale</p>
<p>is really a terrific skill to master,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a very easy skill to master, frankly.</p>
<p>Why do I say a skill?</p>
<p>Well, remember what I said earlier,</p>
<p>which is that humans inhale actively</p>
<p>and most typically will passively exhale,</p>
<p>just let the air drop out of them at whatever rate,</p>
<p>depending on how much air they inhaled.</p>
<p>Actively exhaling, that is actively relaxing the diaphragm</p>
<p>and actively relaxing those intercostal muscles</p>
<p>of the chest, those ones, or I should say between the ribs,</p>
<p>is a skill that you can very quickly acquire</p>
<p>and will allow you to use that relationship</p>
<p>between the phrenic nerve, the diaphragm,</p>
<p>the size of the heart, the heart volume, and all that stuff</p>
<p>to really take control of heart rate quickly</p>
<p>so that if you feel like your heart is racing too much,</p>
<p>and frankly, a lot of people have a lot of</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called interoceptive awareness,</p>
<p>especially anxious people,</p>
<p>they can really sense what&rsquo;s going on in their body,</p>
<p>other people less so, like, oh my God, my heart&rsquo;s beating,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like ready to jump out of my chest,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t like that, I don&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>Big, long exhale.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter if you do it through the nose or the mouth,</p>
<p>big, long exhale is going to allow you</p>
<p>to slow your heart rate down.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about hiccups.</p>
<p>Everybody experiences hiccups from time to time.</p>
<p>I think most people would agree that one hiccup,</p>
<p>sort of funny, two hiccups in a row is really funny,</p>
<p>and three hiccups in a row</p>
<p>is where it starts to be concerning,</p>
<p>in part because hiccups can be kind of painful,</p>
<p>you can experience pain in your gut or your lower abdomen,</p>
<p>and sometimes in your chest as well,</p>
<p>and it feels kind of intrusive,</p>
<p>it gets in the way of having conversation</p>
<p>or just sitting there and relaxing.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there&rsquo;s a simple way to get rid of hiccups,</p>
<p>and you can arrive at that simple technique</p>
<p>if you understand a little bit about</p>
<p>what gives rise to hiccups.</p>
<p>The reason we get hiccups at all</p>
<p>is because we experience a spasm of the phrenic nerve.</p>
<p>The phrenic nerve, as you recall,</p>
<p>is a nerve that emanates from the cervical region,</p>
<p>to be specific, C3, 4, and 5,</p>
<p>those spinal nerves go down, of course, behind the heart,</p>
<p>and innervate the diaphragm, which is the muscle,</p>
<p>that when it contracts, it moves down,</p>
<p>allows the lungs to fill,</p>
<p>and then when you relax the diaphragm,</p>
<p>then the diaphragm moves up and the lungs shrink</p>
<p>or they expel air, so-called exhalation.</p>
<p>Now, the phrenic nerve also has that sensory branch,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not just involved in controlling the diaphragm</p>
<p>at the motor level,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also sensing things deep within the diaphragm</p>
<p>and in the liver as well,</p>
<p>because the liver sits right below the diaphragm.</p>
<p>So a hiccup has that painful sensation from time to time,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a rapid sensory feedback,</p>
<p>or a signal rather,</p>
<p>of a sharp kind of sensation of contraction</p>
<p>within the diaphragm,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s relayed back to the brain</p>
<p>and you consciously perceive that as a little bit of pain,</p>
<p>and then, of course, the hiccup is the hiccup,</p>
<p>which is the spasming of the phrenic nerve</p>
<p>that you experience more or less in your throat,</p>
<p>but all this really is happening along the phrenic nerve</p>
<p>and toward the diaphragm.</p>
<p>What this all means is that if you can stop the phrenic nerve</p>
<p>from spasming, you can stop hiccups.</p>
<p>There are a lot of approaches that people have tried to take</p>
<p>to eliminate spasming of the phrenic nerve.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll hear that breathing into a bag,</p>
<p>which is one way to re-ingest or re-inhale carbon dioxide</p>
<p>that otherwise would be expelled out</p>
<p>into the environment can help.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very indirect method.</p>
<p>It rarely works, frankly,</p>
<p>because it really has to do more with adjusting</p>
<p>your breathing to try and adjust the activity</p>
<p>of the phrenic nerve.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really roundabout way of trying to alleviate hiccups.</p>
<p>Some people will experience relief from drinking</p>
<p>from a glass of water from the opposite side of the glass,</p>
<p>so you sort of have to tilt over at the waist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a kind of messy approach.</p>
<p>Again, it doesn&rsquo;t tend to work a lot of the time.</p>
<p>For some people, it works every time,</p>
<p>but for most people, it doesn&rsquo;t work at all.</p>
<p>However, there is a technique</p>
<p>that can reliably eliminate hiccups,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a technique that takes advantage</p>
<p>of hyper-contracting the phrenic nerve</p>
<p>over a short period of time</p>
<p>so that it then subsequently relaxes</p>
<p>or alleviates the spasming of the phrenic nerve.</p>
<p>And that simple method is to inhale three times in a row.</p>
<p>This is a very unusual pattern of breathing,</p>
<p>but what it involves is taking a big,</p>
<p>deep inhale through your nose.</p>
<p>Then before you exhale any air,</p>
<p>take a second inhale through the nose,</p>
<p>however brief that inhale might be,</p>
<p>and then a third, even micro or millisecond long,</p>
<p>inhale through your nose to get that third inhale,</p>
<p>and then hold your breath for about 15 to 20 seconds,</p>
<p>and then slowly exhale.</p>
<p>So even though I&rsquo;m not experiencing any hiccups right now,</p>
<p>I will demonstrate the method for eliminating hiccups</p>
<p>so that you&rsquo;re all clear on how to do it, okay?</p>
<p>Here I go.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s three inhales all through the nose,</p>
<p>and it is true that that second and third inhale</p>
<p>takes some physical effort to really get additional air</p>
<p>into the lungs without exhaling first.</p>
<p>It feels like the only way I can describe it really</p>
<p>is as a sharp second and third inhale,</p>
<p>because you really have to engage the musculature</p>
<p>of those intracostal muscles in the diaphragm</p>
<p>in order to do it.</p>
<p>And then that long exhale can be through the nose</p>
<p>or the mouth, but I find it particularly relaxing</p>
<p>or even pleasant to do it through the nose.</p>
<p>This method of three inhales through the nose</p>
<p>followed by a long exhale through the nose or mouth</p>
<p>will eliminate hiccups right away,</p>
<p>because what it does is it hyper excites the phrenic nerve</p>
<p>three times in a row, a very unnatural pattern</p>
<p>for the phrenic nerve to fire.</p>
<p>And then it undergoes a hyperpolarization, as we call it,</p>
<p>in which the phrenic nerve actually stands</p>
<p>a much lower probability of getting activated again</p>
<p>for some period of time afterwards.</p>
<p>So it is important that you try and return</p>
<p>to normal cadence of breathing</p>
<p>after doing this three inhales followed by the long exhale.</p>
<p>If you need to perform it a second time</p>
<p>in order to eliminate hiccups,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re simply not going away, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>You can do that.</p>
<p>But as far as we know, this is the most efficient</p>
<p>and science supported way to eliminate hiccups.</p>
<p>Now, up until now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking about breathing techniques</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve mainly focused on breathing techniques</p>
<p>that emphasize the exhale,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s the carbon dioxide tolerance test,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s cyclic sighing</p>
<p>or the physiological side that you use in real time</p>
<p>to reduce stress.</p>
<p>One thing that we haven&rsquo;t talked about so much</p>
<p>is cyclic hyperventilation.</p>
<p>Cyclic hyperventilation, as you recall,</p>
<p>is a bout of 25 or so breaths,</p>
<p>inhaling deeply through the nose</p>
<p>and then passively exhaling,</p>
<p>or sometimes actively exhaling, typically through the mouth.</p>
<p>So it might look like this.</p>
<p>Ah, ah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very active inhale through the nose</p>
<p>and exhale through the mouth.</p>
<p>It can also be done active inhale through the nose,</p>
<p>passive exhale through the mouth, like so.</p>
<p>Ah, ah.</p>
<p>In any event, that pattern of breathing</p>
<p>repeated for 10 to 25 breaths</p>
<p>greatly increases levels of autonomic arousal.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s known to deploy adrenaline from the adrenals.</p>
<p>And in our study, we had people then expel all their air,</p>
<p>so breathe out, hold their breath for 15 to 30 seconds,</p>
<p>and then repeat for a period of five minutes.</p>
<p>That did lead to some very interesting</p>
<p>and positive physiological changes</p>
<p>in terms of stress mitigation,</p>
<p>although not as significant as was observed</p>
<p>with cyclic sighing, as I talked about earlier.</p>
<p>Now, there is a lot of interest in cyclic hyperventilation</p>
<p>for sake of, for instance, extending breath holds.</p>
<p>This has become popular in part</p>
<p>because of the so-called Wim Hof method,</p>
<p>which is a method that combines breathing,</p>
<p>cyclic hyperventilation, followed by lungs full</p>
<p>or lungs empty breath holds,</p>
<p>depending on which variant of the Wim Hof method</p>
<p>one is using.</p>
<p>Separately, and I really want to emphasize separately,</p>
<p>the Wim Hof method also involves deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>which as all of you know, I&rsquo;m a big fan of,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve done episodes of this podcast on,</p>
<p>and we have toolkits on deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>for increasing dopamine levels, epinephrine levels,</p>
<p>immune system function, et cetera.</p>
<p>Wim Hof method also incorporates that,</p>
<p>and it has a mindfulness component.</p>
<p>I do want to caution people</p>
<p>that anytime you&rsquo;re doing cyclic hyperventilation,</p>
<p>you want to be very cautious</p>
<p>about not doing it in or near water</p>
<p>because it does greatly increase the risk</p>
<p>of shallow water blackout.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because when you do cyclic hyperventilation,</p>
<p>you are expelling,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re exhaling more carbon dioxide than usual.</p>
<p>And what I haven&rsquo;t told you yet</p>
<p>is that the trigger to breathe</p>
<p>is actually an increase in carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is you have a small set of neurons</p>
<p>in your brainstem that can detect</p>
<p>when carbon dioxide levels in your bloodstream</p>
<p>reach a certain level.</p>
<p>And when they reach that level,</p>
<p>they trigger the gas reflex</p>
<p>and or the hunger for breathing.</p>
<p>In other words, we don&rsquo;t breathe because we crave oxygen,</p>
<p>although we do need oxygen, of course,</p>
<p>in order to survive and for our brain to function</p>
<p>and our bodily organs to function.</p>
<p>But our brain is wired such that it has a threat sensor,</p>
<p>which is carbon dioxide levels are getting too high.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what triggers the motor reflex to breathe</p>
<p>and to, in some cases, gasp for air,</p>
<p>depending on how starved for air we are.</p>
<p>So if you do cyclic hyperventilation,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s Wim Hof method</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s TUMO method,</p>
<p>again, these things are similar.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not exactly the same.</p>
<p>There are other breathing methods</p>
<p>that incorporate cyclic hyperventilation.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re getting rid</p>
<p>of a lot of carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>And therefore you&rsquo;re removing the impulse</p>
<p>or lowering the impulse to breathe</p>
<p>so that when you enter that breath hold phase</p>
<p>after the hyperventilation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a much longer period of time</p>
<p>before you feel the anxiety and the hunger</p>
<p>and the impulse to breathe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the real benefits of any technique</p>
<p>that incorporates cyclic hyperventilation</p>
<p>is that rather than reduce your stress level in real time,</p>
<p>it actually does the opposite.</p>
<p>It increases your stress level,</p>
<p>increases your level of autonomic arousal,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re doing it deliberately.</p>
<p>And then during those breath holds,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening is you have a lot of adrenaline</p>
<p>circulating in your system</p>
<p>because of the way that hyperventilation</p>
<p>triggers the release of adrenaline from your adrenal glands.</p>
<p>It also triggers the release of epinephrine,</p>
<p>which is the same as adrenaline</p>
<p>from a little brain area called locus coeruleus,</p>
<p>which makes you feel more alert.</p>
<p>And then during those breath holds</p>
<p>and in the subsequent rounds of cyclic hyperventilation,</p>
<p>people experience what it is to have a lot of adrenaline</p>
<p>in their system,</p>
<p>but they are controlling the release of that adrenaline,</p>
<p>which is far and away different</p>
<p>than when life events are triggering that adrenaline.</p>
<p>So what it really is,</p>
<p>is a form of self-induced stress inoculation.</p>
<p>And I do think there are benefits</p>
<p>to practicing cyclic hyperventilation</p>
<p>because it does allow you to learn how to self-deploy</p>
<p>adrenaline and epinephrine from locus coeruleus</p>
<p>and from the adrenals, right?</p>
<p>Got that backwards.</p>
<p>Adrenaline from your adrenals</p>
<p>and epinephrine from locus coeruleus.</p>
<p>And it allows you to explore what it is to maintain</p>
<p>calm state of mind and body</p>
<p>when you have a lot of adrenaline in your system,</p>
<p>which certain studies are starting to show</p>
<p>can allow people to be able to lean into</p>
<p>the stressful aspects of life.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s be honest, life is stressful in any event.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re all going to experience stress</p>
<p>at some point or another.</p>
<p>And when we do,</p>
<p>we want to make sure that we&rsquo;re not overtaken</p>
<p>by the release of adrenaline from the adrenals,</p>
<p>that sudden surge of epinephrine from locus coeruleus.</p>
<p>So doing cyclic hyperventilation,</p>
<p>maybe one or two times per week,</p>
<p>again, 25 breaths, active inhale, passive or active exhale,</p>
<p>do expect to feel tingly</p>
<p>because of that reduction in carbon dioxide</p>
<p>from exhaling so much.</p>
<p>Do expect to feel a little bit agitated.</p>
<p>Be very careful doing this</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re somebody who has anxiety attacks</p>
<p>or somebody who has panic attacks or disorders of any kind.</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t and you want to explore this,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll notice you start to feel really ramped up.</p>
<p>And then during the breath holds,</p>
<p>which again can be done by exhaling and stopping</p>
<p>for some period of time, 15, maybe even 60 seconds,</p>
<p>is a time in which you can explore</p>
<p>how to remain mentally calm.</p>
<p>Some people even choose to do math problems</p>
<p>or think of things in a kind of structured way</p>
<p>while they have a lot of these hormone neurotransmitters</p>
<p>circulating at high levels in their system.</p>
<p>In other words, as a way to learn to manage your mind</p>
<p>and body under conditions of stress.</p>
<p>Now, if you are somebody who&rsquo;s using deliberate</p>
<p>cold exposure, either cold showers</p>
<p>or ice baths or cold immersion,</p>
<p>I often get asked how best to breathe</p>
<p>during those different types of activities.</p>
<p>Really, there&rsquo;s no best way to breathe.</p>
<p>Although if you wanted to turn those activities</p>
<p>into their own form of stress inoculation,</p>
<p>again, please don&rsquo;t use cyclic hyperventilation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dangerous.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recommend it whatsoever,</p>
<p>but you can try to actively slow your breathing.</p>
<p>That is to make sure that you&rsquo;re engaging</p>
<p>in rhythmic breathing.</p>
<p>Now, up until now, I&rsquo;ve said that rhythmic breathing</p>
<p>is the default.</p>
<p>Prebotzinger nucleus controlling rhythmic breathing</p>
<p>is the default.</p>
<p>And that doubling up on inhales and exhales</p>
<p>is something that happens when you deliberately</p>
<p>take over the action of prebotzinger complex.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s true 99% of the time.</p>
<p>However, there are certain conditions</p>
<p>such as conditions of heightened state</p>
<p>of emotional arousal, right?</p>
<p>If you think about somebody who&rsquo;s been crying,</p>
<p>oftentimes they&rsquo;ll do the double inhale exhale.</p>
<p>That says, or triple inhales,</p>
<p>or if somebody is very, very afraid, it&rsquo;s all inhales.</p>
<p>Okay, so it does sometimes happen spontaneously.</p>
<p>Actually, when we get into very cold water,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a very robust decrease in the activation</p>
<p>of the prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>which is the area of brain real estate</p>
<p>right behind the forehead that controls</p>
<p>structured thinking, your ability to reason</p>
<p>and make sense of what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>If you get into really cold water,</p>
<p>you should not expect that brain region to work</p>
<p>or at least not work very well at all</p>
<p>for the first 20 or 30 seconds that you&rsquo;re in the cold water.</p>
<p>From the time you get into cold water,</p>
<p>because here we&rsquo;re talking about deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>I encourage you to try and control your breathing</p>
<p>and make it rhythmic.</p>
<p>That is inhales, follow exhales, follow inhales,</p>
<p>follow exhales, even if they have to be fast,</p>
<p>inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because the default,</p>
<p>when we get into a stressful circumstance,</p>
<p>emotionally or physically stressful circumstance,</p>
<p>is that rhythmic breathing stops</p>
<p>and that parafacial nucleus takes over and it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s that kind of panicky mode.</p>
<p>And by simply controlling our breath,</p>
<p>again, even if it&rsquo;s fast,</p>
<p>from inhale to exhale and making sure</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re alternating inhales and exhales rhythmically.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;ll find is that you&rsquo;ll be able to navigate</p>
<p>that what would otherwise be a very stressful circumstance</p>
<p>and make it less stressful or maybe even pleasant.</p>
<p>And that skill definitely translates</p>
<p>to other aspects of life in which, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re hit square in the face with something stressful.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice your breathing</p>
<p>and your pattern of breathing switching to multiple inhales</p>
<p>or, you know, a breath holding,</p>
<p>essentially departing from rhythmic breathing.</p>
<p>And by quickly returning to rhythmic breathing</p>
<p>and maybe even trying to slow the breathing</p>
<p>and extend those exhales,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll find that you can very quickly calm down.</p>
<p>Next, I&rsquo;d like to discuss what I find</p>
<p>to be an absolutely fascinating topic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also one that&rsquo;s highly useful in the world,</p>
<p>which is how your specific patterns of breathing</p>
<p>relate to your ability to learn and to remember information,</p>
<p>how it can modulate fear,</p>
<p>and a number of other aspects of how your brain functions.</p>
<p>This is a literature that&rsquo;s been reviewed recently</p>
<p>in a lot of exquisite detail in a beautiful review</p>
<p>by Jack Feldman, who I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>one of the pioneers of the neuroscience of breathing.</p>
<p>The title of the review is</p>
<p>Breathing Rhythm and Pattern</p>
<p>and Their Influence on Emotion.</p>
<p>Again, we&rsquo;ll provide a link to this review</p>
<p>in the show note captions.</p>
<p>This review includes discussion of several studies,</p>
<p>one in particular that I&rsquo;ll get into in a bit of detail</p>
<p>that describes the following.</p>
<p>Right now, I just want you to breathe regularly,</p>
<p>meaning rhythmically.</p>
<p>You can inhale and exhale through your mouth</p>
<p>or through your nose.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d prefer that you do it through your nose</p>
<p>because nasal breathing,</p>
<p>unless you need to breathe through your mouth</p>
<p>because of hard exercise or eating or talking</p>
<p>is always going to be the better way to go.</p>
<p>Nasal breathing improves the aesthetic of your face.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been shown.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about that just briefly in a few minutes.</p>
<p>Nasal breathing improves the amount of oxygen</p>
<p>you can bring into your system, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>Okay, so just breathe.</p>
<p>Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale.</p>
<p>And know that during your exhales,</p>
<p>your pupil, that is the pupil of your eye,</p>
<p>is getting bigger.</p>
<p>And as you exhale, it&rsquo;s getting smaller.</p>
<p>In addition, when you inhale,</p>
<p>your reaction time to anything that happens around you,</p>
<p>a car swerving in front of you,</p>
<p>something that you might detect in the periphery</p>
<p>of your vision or hear off in the distance,</p>
<p>increases significantly compared to when you&rsquo;re exhaling.</p>
<p>In addition, when you are inhaling,</p>
<p>your ability to remember things,</p>
<p>especially things that take a bit of effort to remember,</p>
<p>and your ability to learn new information</p>
<p>is significantly greater than it is when you&rsquo;re exhaling.</p>
<p>Now, as you hear all that, you&rsquo;re probably thinking,</p>
<p>okay, how do I just inhale?</p>
<p>Well, of course, that&rsquo;s not going to be the best approach.</p>
<p>You need to exhale as well</p>
<p>for all the reasons you now are well aware of.</p>
<p>But what these findings really illustrate,</p>
<p>and I should mention,</p>
<p>these findings are all carried out in humans, all right?</p>
<p>So these relate to some stuff in animal studies,</p>
<p>but what I just described has been shown</p>
<p>in human studies consistently.</p>
<p>When we inhale,</p>
<p>and in particular, when we inhale through our nose,</p>
<p>our brain is not functioning in the same way</p>
<p>as when we exhale.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that our brain is functioning</p>
<p>in a deficient way when we exhale.</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t function as well</p>
<p>as it relates to memory retrieval, memory formation,</p>
<p>and some other aspects of cognition.</p>
<p>Now, you might be asking, why in the world would this be?</p>
<p>Well, I wasn&rsquo;t consulted at the design phase,</p>
<p>and anyone that tells you that they were,</p>
<p>you should back away from quickly.</p>
<p>But one reasonable explanation</p>
<p>for why our brain functions better,</p>
<p>at least in the context of what I just talked about,</p>
<p>when we inhale is because the olfactory system</p>
<p>is actually the most ancient sensory system</p>
<p>of all the sensory systems we have.</p>
<p>So before vision, before audition, before touch,</p>
<p>before all of that,</p>
<p>the olfactory system is the most ancient system.</p>
<p>And the olfactory system, of course,</p>
<p>is designed to detect chemicals in the environment.</p>
<p>And so if you imagine an early organism</p>
<p>that perhaps we evolved from, or perhaps we didn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, that we share some features of,</p>
<p>at least in terms of olfactory function,</p>
<p>in order to get that chemical information into the brain,</p>
<p>we need to inhale, we need to bring that information in.</p>
<p>Now, for aquatic animals,</p>
<p>they could take it in through water,</p>
<p>but for animals that are terrestrial, that live on land,</p>
<p>they would have to get it through the air.</p>
<p>So inhalation, we know, activates certain regions</p>
<p>of the so-called piriform cortex.</p>
<p>These are areas of the neocortex that are more ancient,</p>
<p>as well as increasing the activity of brain areas,</p>
<p>such as the hippocampus,</p>
<p>which is a brain area involved in learning and memory.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the studies</p>
<p>that illustrates this most beautifully</p>
<p>is a study that was published</p>
<p>in the Journal of Neuroscience in 2016.</p>
<p>By the way, Journal of Neuroscience is a very fine journal.</p>
<p>And the title of this paper is</p>
<p>Nasal Respiration in Transhuman Limbic Oscillations</p>
<p>and Modulates Cognitive Function.</p>
<p>This is a paper that followed up on an earlier paper</p>
<p>that showed that when people breathe in through their nose,</p>
<p>their recognition and their discrimination</p>
<p>of different odors was far greater</p>
<p>than when they breathed in through their mouth.</p>
<p>Now, that result was interesting,</p>
<p>but it was also sort of a duh,</p>
<p>because you smell things with your nose, not your mouth.</p>
<p>You taste things with your mouth</p>
<p>and you speak with your mouth,</p>
<p>and there are a bunch of other things</p>
<p>you can do with your mouth.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, that study pointed to the idea</p>
<p>that the brain is different during nasal inhalations</p>
<p>versus nasal exhalations</p>
<p>versus mouth inhalations versus exhalations.</p>
<p>What it basically showed is that the brain</p>
<p>ramps up its levels of activity,</p>
<p>and that signal to noise that we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>if you recall, that ability for the brain</p>
<p>to detect things in the environment</p>
<p>is increased during inhalations.</p>
<p>But because that earlier study focused on smell,</p>
<p>on olfaction, there was a bit of a confound there.</p>
<p>It was hard to separate out the variables.</p>
<p>So this paper, the one I just mentioned,</p>
<p>Nasal Respiration and Transhuman Limbic Oscillations</p>
<p>and Modulates Cognitive Function,</p>
<p>did not look at detection of odors.</p>
<p>Rather, it looked at things like reaction time or fear.</p>
<p>And basically what it found is that reaction time</p>
<p>is greatly reduced when people are inhaling.</p>
<p>So they had people look at fearful stimuli.</p>
<p>They looked at their reaction time to fearful stimuli.</p>
<p>In other words, their ability to detect</p>
<p>certain kinds of stimuli,</p>
<p>and they were given a lot of different kinds of stimuli.</p>
<p>So they had to be able to discriminate</p>
<p>between one sort of, oops, excuse me,</p>
<p>one, by the way, folks, for those listening,</p>
<p>I just bumped the microphone, getting rather animated here.</p>
<p>What these subjects had to do was detect</p>
<p>one type of stimulus versus another stimulus</p>
<p>that they were being exposed to.</p>
<p>And what they found is if people were inhaling</p>
<p>as that fear-inducing stimulus was presented,</p>
<p>their reaction time to notice it was much, much faster.</p>
<p>And they related that to patterns of brain activity.</p>
<p>And they were able to do that</p>
<p>because they were actually recording from the brain</p>
<p>directly from beneath the skull.</p>
<p>And they were able to do that</p>
<p>because they had some patients</p>
<p>that had intracranial electrodes embedded in their brain</p>
<p>for sake of trying to detect epileptic seizures.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot to this study</p>
<p>and a lot that we could discuss.</p>
<p>But the basic takeaway is that</p>
<p>when people are inhaling,</p>
<p>that is when they&rsquo;re drawing air in</p>
<p>through their nose in particular,</p>
<p>their ability to detect what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>in the world around them is greatly enhanced.</p>
<p>And not just for fear, but also for surprise of all sorts.</p>
<p>So when people are inhaling,</p>
<p>their ability to detect novel stimuli,</p>
<p>things that are unexpected</p>
<p>or that are unusual in their environment</p>
<p>is significantly increased.</p>
<p>Again, we&rsquo;ll put a link to this study as well.</p>
<p>I find it to be one of the more interesting studies</p>
<p>in this realm.</p>
<p>Although there are now many additional studies</p>
<p>that support this statement that I made earlier,</p>
<p>which is that during inhalation, also called inspiration,</p>
<p>there are a number of very fast physiological changes,</p>
<p>such as changes in pupil diameter,</p>
<p>changes in the activity of the hippocampus,</p>
<p>this memory encoding and retrieval area of the brain</p>
<p>and other areas of the brain.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the tool takeaway from this?</p>
<p>If you are sitting down to read or research or study,</p>
<p>or you really want to learn some information,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re listening to a podcast</p>
<p>or some other sorts of information that you want to retain,</p>
<p>it actually makes sense to increase the duration</p>
<p>or the intensity of your inhales as you do that.</p>
<p>The more that you&rsquo;re inhaling relative to exhaling</p>
<p>in terms of duration,</p>
<p>the more that your brain is in this focused mode</p>
<p>and this mode of being able to access</p>
<p>and retrieve information better.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s one caveat to this that I think is important</p>
<p>because I know a number of people listen to this podcast</p>
<p>for sake of gleaning tools,</p>
<p>not just for cognitive enhancement,</p>
<p>but for physical enhancement.</p>
<p>It turns out that when you are inhaling air,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually less able,</p>
<p>or I should say less efficient</p>
<p>at generating voluntary movements.</p>
<p>Now, that might come as a surprise.</p>
<p>You know, up until now,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve basically been talking about inhalation is great,</p>
<p>almost to the point where you wonder,</p>
<p>like, is exhalation good for anything, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to over-breathe</p>
<p>and kick out too much carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>Well, of course, exhalation is great for things.</p>
<p>In fact, if you&rsquo;re somebody</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s played baseball or softball,</p>
<p>well, what are you told?</p>
<p>That you should exhale on the swing</p>
<p>to generate the maximum amount of power.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody who has done martial arts of any kind,</p>
<p>who has traditional Western boxing,</p>
<p>as you strike, that&rsquo;s where people typically do the hi-yah,</p>
<p>like in the sort of classic karate type thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more of a movie thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether or not people actually use the hi-yah,</p>
<p>but in boxing, oftentimes people will do the shh.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;ll do a rapid exhalation,</p>
<p>a forceful exhalation,</p>
<p>keeping in mind, again, that inhales typically are active.</p>
<p>They engage the diaphragmatic muscle.</p>
<p>They engage those intracostal muscles,</p>
<p>whereas exhales tend to be passive</p>
<p>unless we take active control of the exhale.</p>
<p>And indeed, our ability to generate fast, directed,</p>
<p>so-called volitional, voluntary movements</p>
<p>is greatly enhanced if we do them during the exhale,</p>
<p>not the inhale.</p>
<p>Now, with all of that said,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t yet really talked about</p>
<p>mouth versus nasal breathing,</p>
<p>and it really can be a fairly short discussion</p>
<p>because what abundant data now show</p>
<p>and has been beautifully described</p>
<p>in the book called Jaws, A Hidden Epidemic.</p>
<p>This is a book that was written</p>
<p>by Paul Ehrlich and Sandra Kahn,</p>
<p>my colleagues at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>It has an introduction and a foreword from Jared Diamond</p>
<p>and from the great Robert Sapolsky,</p>
<p>so some real heavy hitters on this book.</p>
<p>What that book really describes is that whenever possible,</p>
<p>meaning unless you&rsquo;re speaking or eating</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re exercising or other activities</p>
<p>require some change in your pattern of breathing,</p>
<p>we should really all be striving to breathe</p>
<p>through our nose, not through our mouth.</p>
<p>And that relates to the increased resistance</p>
<p>to breathing through the nose we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;ll say it a third time,</p>
<p>that increased resistance through the nose</p>
<p>allows you to inflate your lungs more, not less.</p>
<p>The other thing that breathing through your nose</p>
<p>allows you to do is it both warms and moisturizes</p>
<p>the air that you bring into your lungs,</p>
<p>which is more favorable for lung health</p>
<p>than breathing through the mouth.</p>
<p>Hard breathing through the mouth</p>
<p>or simply mouth breathing at all</p>
<p>is actually quite damaging or can be, I should say,</p>
<p>quite damaging to some of the respiratory functions</p>
<p>of your lungs.</p>
<p>That of course does not mean</p>
<p>that you shouldn&rsquo;t breathe hard through your mouth</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re running or sprinting or exercising hard,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t want mouth breathing</p>
<p>to be the chronic default pattern that you follow.</p>
<p>Nasal breathing is the best pattern of breathing to follow</p>
<p>as a default state.</p>
<p>Another aspect of nasal breathing that&rsquo;s really beneficial</p>
<p>is that the gas, nitric oxide,</p>
<p>is actually created in the nasal passages.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a gas that can cause relaxation of the smooth muscles</p>
<p>that relate to the vasculature, not just of your nose,</p>
<p>but of your brain and for all the tissues of your body.</p>
<p>This is why nasal breathing and not mouth breathing</p>
<p>is great for when you want to relieve congestion.</p>
<p>So a lot of these things seem counterintuitive, right?</p>
<p>Your nose is stuff,</p>
<p>so that mainly makes people breathe through their mouth,</p>
<p>but it turns out that breathing through your nose</p>
<p>will allow some dilation of the vasculature,</p>
<p>more blood flow, dilation of the nasal passages,</p>
<p>and delivery of nitric oxide</p>
<p>to all the tissues of your body.</p>
<p>And that dilation of the small capillaries</p>
<p>that innervate essentially every organ of your body</p>
<p>allow the delivery of more nutrients</p>
<p>and the removal of carbon dioxide</p>
<p>and other waste products from those tissues more readily</p>
<p>than if you&rsquo;re not getting enough, excuse me,</p>
<p>nitric oxide into your system.</p>
<p>Okay, so a lot of reasons to be a nasal breather.</p>
<p>If you want to check out that book,</p>
<p>Jaws, Hidden Epidemics, it&rsquo;s a terrific read,</p>
<p>and it also shows some absolutely striking pictures,</p>
<p>twin studies and so forth,</p>
<p>and some before and afters of people</p>
<p>and the aesthetic changes that they experienced</p>
<p>when they shifted from being a mouth breather</p>
<p>to a nose breather.</p>
<p>These are striking examples</p>
<p>that have been observed over and over again.</p>
<p>When people mouth breathe,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an elongation of the jaw,</p>
<p>droopiness of the eyelids,</p>
<p>and the entire jaw structure really changes in ways</p>
<p>that are not aesthetically favorable.</p>
<p>Fortunately, when people switch to becoming nasal breathers,</p>
<p>and of course that takes some encouragement</p>
<p>either by mouth taping</p>
<p>or doing their cardiovascular exercise with mouth closed,</p>
<p>or by doing the sorts of exercises</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>when they switch to becoming nasal breathers by default,</p>
<p>the aesthetic changes that occur</p>
<p>are very dramatic and very favorable,</p>
<p>including sort of elevation of the eyebrows,</p>
<p>not in an artificial sense or in a kind of outrageous way,</p>
<p>but elevation of the cheekbones,</p>
<p>sharpening of the jaw,</p>
<p>and most notably improvements of the teeth</p>
<p>and the entire jaw structure.</p>
<p>In fact, one simple test of whether or not</p>
<p>you can be an efficient nasal breather,</p>
<p>and whether or not you&rsquo;ve been nasal breathing efficiently</p>
<p>or most of the time in the past,</p>
<p>or whether or not you&rsquo;ve been relying more</p>
<p>on mouth breathing,</p>
<p>that was described in the book, Jaws,</p>
<p>is you should be able to close your mouth</p>
<p>and breathe only through your nose.</p>
<p>Again, this is at rest,</p>
<p>not during exercise necessarily,</p>
<p>but you might do it during exercise.</p>
<p>But close your mouth,</p>
<p>put your tongue on the roof of your mouth,</p>
<p>and it should fit behind your teeth,</p>
<p>and you should be able to nose breathe in that position.</p>
<p>And many people won&rsquo;t be able to do that,</p>
<p>but fortunately, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>if you nasal breathe,</p>
<p>that is you deliberately nasal breathe when at rest</p>
<p>for some period of time,</p>
<p>you will experience an increased ability to nasal breathe,</p>
<p>and you should also experience some addition of space</p>
<p>within the palate of your mouth</p>
<p>to allow your tongue to sit more completely</p>
<p>on the roof of your mouth.</p>
<p>This is especially true for children</p>
<p>that perform this technique.</p>
<p>Again, I refer you to the book, Jaws, A Hidden Epidemic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an absolutely spectacular book.</p>
<p>You can also just look online</p>
<p>before and after Jaws, Hidden Epidemic,</p>
<p>and look at some of the changes in facial structure</p>
<p>that occur when people move from mouth to nasal breathing,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really quite striking.</p>
<p>So during today&rsquo;s episode, per always,</p>
<p>we covered a lot of information.</p>
<p>First, we talked about the mechanical aspects of breathing,</p>
<p>the lungs, the diaphragm, the trachea, and so forth.</p>
<p>We also talked about the chemical aspects of breathing,</p>
<p>that really breathing is a way</p>
<p>that we bring oxygen to our cells</p>
<p>and that we get the correct levels,</p>
<p>or I should say we maintain the correct levels</p>
<p>of carbon dioxide in our system,</p>
<p>neither too much nor too little</p>
<p>in order to allow oxygen to do its magic</p>
<p>and to allow carbon dioxide to do its magic,</p>
<p>because as you learned during today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>carbon dioxide is not just a waste by-product.</p>
<p>It has very critical physiological functions.</p>
<p>You need to have enough of it around,</p>
<p>and therefore you don&rsquo;t want to over-breathe,</p>
<p>especially at rest.</p>
<p>We talked about a tool to measure</p>
<p>how well you manage carbon dioxide,</p>
<p>the so-called carbon dioxide tolerance test,</p>
<p>and various exercises that you can use</p>
<p>simply by breathing to decrease your stress in real time,</p>
<p>decrease your stress chronically around the clock.</p>
<p>Obviously, that&rsquo;s a good thing,</p>
<p>improve sleep, improve mood.</p>
<p>How to increase breath hold times,</p>
<p>and why you might want to do that.</p>
<p>Also, how to eliminate hiccups.</p>
<p>We talked about how to breathe</p>
<p>in order to eliminate the side stitch or side cramp</p>
<p>that you might experience during exercise,</p>
<p>and how to breathe in order to improve learning and memory,</p>
<p>reaction time, and various other aspects</p>
<p>of cognitive and physical function.</p>
<p>I do realize it&rsquo;s a lot of information,</p>
<p>but as always, I try and give you information</p>
<p>that is clear, hopefully interesting as well,</p>
<p>and actionable toward a number of different endpoints.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody that&rsquo;s just now starting to think</p>
<p>about the application of breath work,</p>
<p>I would encourage you to please, yes,</p>
<p>do the carbon dioxide tolerance test.</p>
<p>That will give you some window into how well</p>
<p>or how poorly you&rsquo;re managing breathing.</p>
<p>And then here&rsquo;s the great news.</p>
<p>The great news is that breath work,</p>
<p>that is deliberate respiration practices,</p>
<p>are very effective at creating change very quickly.</p>
<p>In some cases, such as the use of the physiological sigh</p>
<p>or cyclic hyperventilation,</p>
<p>those changes can be experienced</p>
<p>the first time and every time,</p>
<p>because again, these are not hacks.</p>
<p>These are aspects of your breathing apparati,</p>
<p>including the mechanical stuff and the neural stuff</p>
<p>and the gas exchange stuff,</p>
<p>all of which you were born with,</p>
<p>and that are available to you at any moment.</p>
<p>So all you really have to do is explore them</p>
<p>and deploy them as you feel necessary.</p>

<p>Not so much on today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>we discuss supplements.</p>
<p>While supplements aren&rsquo;t necessary for everybody,</p>
<p>many people derive tremendous benefit from them</p>
<p>for things like improving sleep, hormone function,</p>
<p>cognitive function, and so on.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered</p>
<p>with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done that for several reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, Momentus Supplements</p>
<p>are of the very highest quality.</p>
<p>Second of all, Momentus Supplements tend to center</p>
<p>around single ingredient formulations.</p>
<p>This is incredibly important</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re going to include supplements</p>
<p>in your daily regimen,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to want to use the right supplements</p>
<p>in the right dosages,</p>
<p>and you want to do that in the most biologically</p>
<p>and cost-effective way.</p>
<p>And single ingredient formulations</p>
<p>are the only way that you can determine what works</p>
<p>and what doesn&rsquo;t work for you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the only way in which you can adjust the dosage</p>
<p>of given supplements, or maybe even alternate days</p>
<p>that you take one and not the other,</p>
<p>in a way that really allows you to home in</p>
<p>on which supplements are going to be ideal</p>
<p>for your mental health, physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>Also, Momentus Supplements ship internationally,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s great because we know a number of you reside</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements discussed</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus, spelled O-U-S,</p>
<p>so livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not already following us on social media,</p>
<p>we are Huberman Lab on Instagram, Twitter,</p>
<p>Facebook, and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>And I should mention that on all those platforms,</p>
<p>I discuss science and science-related tools,</p>
<p>some of which overlap with the contents</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>but much of which is distinct from the content</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.</p>
<p>And if you haven&rsquo;t already subscribed</p>
<p>to our Neural Network newsletter,</p>
<p>it is a zero-cost monthly newsletter</p>
<p>in which we give a summaries of podcast episodes</p>
<p>and toolkits, for instance, Toolkit for Sleep,</p>
<p>Toolkit for Managing Dopamine,</p>
<p>Toolkit for Deliberate Cold Exposure.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s all zero cost to sign up.</p>
<p>You simply go to HubermanLab.com,</p>
<p>go to the menu function, scroll down to newsletter,</p>
<p>and you supply your email.</p>
<p>We do not share your email with anybody else.</p>
<p>And there are also some example newsletters</p>
<p>there at HubermanLab.com for you to explore.</p>
<p>Once again, I&rsquo;d like to thank you for today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>all about the biology and application of breathing.</p>
<p>And last, but certainly not least,</p>
<p>thank you for your interest in science.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
