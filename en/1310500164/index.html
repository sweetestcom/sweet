    <p>The following is a conversation with Brendan Eich,</p>
<p>creator of the JavaScript programming language,</p>
<p>cofounder of Mozilla, which created the Firefox browser,</p>
<p>and now cofounder and CEO of Brave Software,</p>
<p>which has created the Brave browser.</p>
<p>Each of these are revolutionary technologies.</p>
<p>JavaScript is one of the most widely used</p>
<p>and impactful programming languages in the world.</p>
<p>Firefox pioneered many browser ideas that we love today</p>
<p>or even take for granted today,</p>
<p>and Brave is looking to revolutionize</p>
<p>not only the browser, but content creation online</p>
<p>and the nature of the internet</p>
<p>to make it fundamentally about respecting</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s control over their data.</p>

<p>As a side note, let me say that there&rsquo;s a tension</p>
<p>between theory and engineering</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about.</p>
<p>I tweeted something like,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good execution is more important than a good idea,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;but one helps the other.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think the wording of that sucks,</p>
<p>but what I mean is a good idea is a must,</p>
<p>but in my experience, good ideas are in abundance.</p>
<p>Good execution, on the other hand, is rare.</p>
<p>I think some mix of good timing, good idea,</p>
<p>and good execution is essential.</p>
<p>Getting that mix right is tough,</p>
<p>and Brendan, somehow, multiple times in his career,</p>
<p>did just that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to believe it&rsquo;s more art than science,</p>
<p>like most interesting things in life.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Brendan Eich.</p>
<p>When did you first fall in love with programming?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t program a lot when I was in high school,</p>
<p>but I had a friend who had a Commodore PET,</p>
<p>and after we saw Star Wars, he said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hey, let&rsquo;s make a basic program</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;that does the Death Star Trench run.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it was just simple 2D graphics,</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t know what I was doing,</p>
<p>so I just helped him out on the math and stuff like that.</p>
<p>I was a math and science kid.</p>
<p>I was really into the HP calculators of the early mid-&rsquo;70s.</p>
<p>These were the RPN.</p>
<p>They were really strongly built,</p>
<p>and as Arik Goldfinger said of gold, divinely heavy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably some gold in them, too, gold metalization.</p>
<p>But they were awesome calculators,</p>
<p>and they had all the scientific functions,</p>
<p>so I was really into that.</p>
<p>So I aimed toward physics.</p>
<p>I was a little late for the, I think,</p>
<p>the 20th century golden age,</p>
<p>and I read a lot of science fiction,</p>
<p>so I was like, yeah, it&rsquo;s on the hyperdrives</p>
<p>and warp drives, and physics was not gonna get there quickly,</p>
<p>and I started hacking on computers</p>
<p>while I was studying physics as an undergraduate</p>
<p>at Santa Clara University,</p>
<p>and I dodged the Fortran bullet</p>
<p>because I was in the science department</p>
<p>instead of the engineering department,</p>
<p>where they still did Fortran card decks.</p>
<p>I think they had an auto collator.</p>
<p>But we were using Pascal,</p>
<p>and I got one of the first portable C Compilers ports</p>
<p>to the DEC minicomputers we were using,</p>
<p>and I fell in love with programming</p>
<p>just based on procedural abstraction, Pascal,</p>
<p>just what now would be considered old school,</p>
<p>like structured programming from the 70s.</p>
<p>Niklaus Wirth, the creator of Pascal,</p>
<p>was a good writer and a good pedagogue, right?</p>
<p>He always at ETH would do these courses</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like build your own computer,</p>
<p>build your own compiler, build your own operating system.</p>
<p>It was scratch. Yeah, kind of.</p>
<p>And I know some people who were grad students under him</p>
<p>and said he would torture the students</p>
<p>with things like this custom email system</p>
<p>that had 25 word limit and things like that.</p>
<p>I unfortunately dodged both the Pascal</p>
<p>and the Fortran bullets.</p>
<p>Could you maybe linger on the Pascal?</p>
<p>What kind of programming language was it?</p>
<p>What is it reminiscent of today?</p>
<p>Because it sounds like it may have had an impact</p>
<p>on your own trajectory.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was in the ALGOL family,</p>
<p>and ALGOL was the big successful language design</p>
<p>and compiler project in the 60s.</p>
<p>It had a successor called ALGOL 68,</p>
<p>which was ambitious but not as successful.</p>
<p>But Pascal was kind of wordy procedures</p>
<p>and functions language.</p>
<p>It distinguished between functions</p>
<p>which return a value and procedures which don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>which just compute.</p>
<p>And you could say that whole ALGOL family went into ADA.</p>
<p>Pascal had a second life thanks to Borland</p>
<p>with Turbo Pascal, which was hugely successful.</p>
<p>I think in large part due to Anders Helberg,</p>
<p>who then went to Microsoft and did C Sharp and done that</p>
<p>with his team there and has done really well</p>
<p>doing TypeScript, type JavaScript.</p>
<p>So yeah, there&rsquo;s a lineage here.</p>
<p>But I was also interested in C and Unix</p>
<p>by the time I was an undergrad</p>
<p>because people were bringing Unix up</p>
<p>on all sorts of hardware.</p>
<p>I had some friends who were doing</p>
<p>their own wirewrapped computers, 6820 maybe.</p>
<p>And I was wirewrapping for my engineering course,</p>
<p>6809 or something simpler, building a computer on a board.</p>
<p>And I wanted to build a more ambitious one</p>
<p>and port Unix to it, but I picked the wrong processor.</p>
<p>I picked the National Semiconductor NS16032,</p>
<p>which was this amazing, you know,</p>
<p>CISC, complex instruction set computer,</p>
<p>and not the reduced instruction set computers</p>
<p>that were just being contemplated into the mid eighties.</p>
<p>And RISC ultimately went out.</p>
<p>RISC won in some ways, it dissolved into,</p>
<p>you have both now, you have these super scalar architectures</p>
<p>where like Intel has kept probably too much</p>
<p>backward compatibility at the instruction level,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s just, there&rsquo;s a front end that parses that</p>
<p>into these, you know, these wide internal instructions.</p>
<p>So, you know, the very long instruction word research</p>
<p>that was also interesting at the time</p>
<p>kind of became the micro architecture</p>
<p>inside the backward compatible Intel.</p>
<p>But I picked a National Semi chip</p>
<p>and it never got made successfully.</p>
<p>It was full of bugs and I never could have brought it up.</p>
<p>But I went on out of physics after three years</p>
<p>into math, computer science.</p>
<p>And like I said, I did it because I saw,</p>
<p>I was being sort of childlike and naive about physics.</p>
<p>And I thought, meanwhile, the Valley is go go for computers.</p>
<p>The Apple II, right?</p>
<p>The PC, the Intel 8086, 8088 based PC,</p>
<p>the IBM, you know, gave Microsoft the future for,</p>
<p>you know, somewhat fishy deal.</p>
<p>So it was wide open in the computing space,</p>
<p>but in physics, you were as optimistic about physics as?</p>
<p>No, I mean, I was one of three brothers</p>
<p>who were all in the same grade.</p>
<p>I have a twin and a younger brother who skipped second grade</p>
<p>and was with us the whole time after that.</p>
<p>And, you know, he went on,</p>
<p>he actually studied under Kip Thorne at Caltech.</p>
<p>But he also didn&rsquo;t, he ended up in software.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t talk about physics stuff.</p>
<p>Does it make you sad that theoretical physics,</p>
<p>even with string theory,</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t really had any foundational breakthroughs</p>
<p>in the latter part of the 20th century?</p>
<p>Yeah, in fact, I&rsquo;d say the problem is theory</p>
<p>over experiment.</p>
<p>I would say, you know, we need more Aristotle</p>
<p>and less Plato.</p>
<p>You know, mathematics is not all physical.</p>
<p>There are lots of mathematics that cannot be realized</p>
<p>as far as I know in this world.</p>
<p>So to understand the world, you need to do experiments.</p>
<p>You need to not just dream up inductive theories</p>
<p>that could have lots of alternative theories</p>
<p>competing with them, with no way to decide between them,</p>
<p>except aesthetics, which is not a good guide in my opinion.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know if you are friends</p>
<p>or have a relationship with Elon Musk.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the, in terms of like what you would love to see</p>
<p>our society investing in, building up,</p>
<p>is it closer to Elon or is it closer to Feynman</p>
<p>and Einstein and those?</p>
<p>Well, those gentlemen are no longer with us</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s noticed.</p>
<p>So like I said, the real glory days of physics,</p>
<p>the famous pictures from Germany before the second war</p>
<p>were just a fantastic assembly of brains,</p>
<p>Schrodinger and Einstein.</p>
<p>And physics, I think, took a wrong turn</p>
<p>that maybe all of, I would say, Western science</p>
<p>took in going for models over reality, right?</p>
<p>You see this in all sorts of fields.</p>
<p>Now, we can build models that are very predictive</p>
<p>and generative and then we build actual devices</p>
<p>or semiconductors, things like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good, I&rsquo;m not dismissing that.</p>
<p>We need good models, we need to experiment</p>
<p>and prove them and test them.</p>
<p>But the problem I&rsquo;ve seen in physics,</p>
<p>which you see certainly in economics, the dismal science,</p>
<p>and you see surprisingly in other so called hard sciences</p>
<p>is models that don&rsquo;t really have to be</p>
<p>tested against reality.</p>
<p>They can instead become policy tools</p>
<p>or they can become, like I said,</p>
<p>one of a large family of alternate theories</p>
<p>that could be as predictive</p>
<p>but nobody&rsquo;s doing the winnowing out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such an interesting tension in society.</p>
<p>You see this in even the software scientists</p>
<p>which have a deep love for psychology.</p>
<p>You see this in epidemiology, not with the virus.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this tension of how much of the world</p>
<p>can we understand through just a beautifully fit model?</p>
<p>And then at the same time, my main work</p>
<p>is in machine learning where it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>there is no provable thing usually.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about just getting the right data set</p>
<p>and getting tricks and so on.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this tension even in my own soul</p>
<p>of I grew up on theoretical computer science.</p>
<p>I loved approximation algorithms,</p>
<p>all of that different complexity classes,</p>
<p>just those little puzzles.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know, to you as somebody</p>
<p>who was in math and computer science</p>
<p>and then ended up going into places</p>
<p>where you engineer some of the most impactful things</p>
<p>in this world, do you see the P versus NP,</p>
<p>all that whole space is interesting at all?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not that useful in practice.</p>
<p>People are using it with sort of crypto analysis</p>
<p>or asymptotic arguments about can we have</p>
<p>a quantum resistant crypto algorithm, things like that,</p>
<p>which may not be practical, right?</p>
<p>If you follow Mikhail Diakonov or Gil Kalai,</p>
<p>there are big questions about how quantum computing</p>
<p>will scale up, how practical it will be.</p>
<p>Is that something that you think about quantum computing?</p>
<p>Not except for spare time.</p>
<p>Like you said, I&rsquo;m not using this kind of computer science</p>
<p>in practice because almost everything now is engineering</p>
<p>and finding ways to get computers</p>
<p>to be more useful for people,</p>
<p>which goes from design problems,</p>
<p>which are really kind of an art.</p>
<p>Like you said, anything you can&rsquo;t automate is an art.</p>
<p>Well, we can have machine learning compose music</p>
<p>and it can imitate, you can train it,</p>
<p>and it can sound kind of decent,</p>
<p>but maybe lacking that je ne sais quoi.</p>
<p>But user interface still, I think, requires human art.</p>
<p>So speaking of things that didn&rsquo;t follow</p>
<p>a perfect theory and model, JavaScript,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s two things.</p>
<p>One, it had an impact on the world at a huge scale,</p>
<p>obviously, and it also still is one of probably</p>
<p>the most popular programming language in the world.</p>
<p>So can we go back to the origin story?</p>
<p>Can you tell the story of how JavaScript was created?</p>
<p>Yeah, I was at Silicon Graphics</p>
<p>after graduate school for seven years,</p>
<p>and it got to be big and successful</p>
<p>and divisionalized and political,</p>
<p>and I thought kind of boring.</p>
<p>And a friend who&rsquo;d been there went to one of the last</p>
<p>of the super companies, the super startups</p>
<p>in the early 90s.</p>
<p>There were several.</p>
<p>I suppose General Magic was a little after that</p>
<p>around the same time.</p>
<p>But Micro Unity was that company that I went to,</p>
<p>and it was because my friend Jeff Weinstein</p>
<p>had gone there from Silicon Graphics.</p>
<p>He recruited me, and Micro Unity was doing everything.</p>
<p>So this was like the ultimate sort of pretend grad school.</p>
<p>It was doing a new fab, new semiconductor process.</p>
<p>It was doing new analog and digital circuits</p>
<p>on the same very large but not wafer scale chip.</p>
<p>Originally, it was five centimeters on a side.</p>
<p>It was really hot too, so I needed a water cooler.</p>
<p>It was a Craykiller, and then they shrunk it,</p>
<p>and they tried to do a home sort of media processor</p>
<p>that was essentially a barrel processor.</p>
<p>But you could think of trying to do all the things</p>
<p>that we now see in modern architectures</p>
<p>with short vector instructions</p>
<p>and sort of wide instructions or multiple issue,</p>
<p>and doing a lot of the stuff in software</p>
<p>because the second iteration, the set top box,</p>
<p>was really for avoiding the cost to the cable company</p>
<p>of rolling the trucks out</p>
<p>to replace your garbage General Atlantic set top box</p>
<p>with a totally newer, less garbagey one.</p>
<p>So if you could have software gradable set top boxes,</p>
<p>the cable companies thought they could save a lot of money</p>
<p>and add features.</p>
<p>Is this assembly, or which level of the software?</p>
<p>It was like, we were writing in, we were using GCC.</p>
<p>We were writing C++ and C.</p>
<p>Somebody I worked with there, really very smart guy,</p>
<p>hired from a sort of Wall Street</p>
<p>hotshot programming consultancy,</p>
<p>did his own hardware design as well as software.</p>
<p>And we were working on how to make</p>
<p>not only a short vector units,</p>
<p>but general bit shufflers and permuters.</p>
<p>So you could do things like crypto algorithms efficiently,</p>
<p>and you could do demodulation of the cable,</p>
<p>complex quadrature amplitude modulated signal.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re basically taking A to D converters,</p>
<p>dumping things in buffers,</p>
<p>and then doing the rest in software.</p>
<p>All the framing and the Reed Solomon and Viterbi</p>
<p>and all that error correction.</p>
<p>So that was really great learning experience,</p>
<p>but it was not gonna work.</p>
<p>It was doing too many risky things at once, right?</p>
<p>If you, as Jim Clark said to me,</p>
<p>when I hopped to Netscape after three years at MicroUnity,</p>
<p>he said, oh yeah, you do 10 things each,</p>
<p>one in 10 odds, it&rsquo;s gonna be one in 10 billion, right?</p>
<p>The multiplication principle.</p>
<p>So, Netscape was already a rocket,</p>
<p>and I passed the chance to go there in 1994.</p>
<p>I knew the founders because I worked at SGI,</p>
<p>Clark&rsquo;s company.</p>
<p>Could you pause for a second in Netscape?</p>
<p>When was the launch of this rocket?</p>
<p>94.</p>
<p>94 was the launch of Netscape?</p>
<p>And I went there in early 95 in April.</p>
<p>Okay, so you said you missed the launch.</p>
<p>Well, I missed the first floor employment opportunity,</p>
<p>but the IPO was August 1995, so I was there for that.</p>
<p>How obvious was it that Netscape was like world changing?</p>
<p>What was the layout?</p>
<p>Was Netscape one of the first big browsers?</p>
<p>Yes, so when I was at MicroUnity still in 93,</p>
<p>we saw a browser called Mosaic.</p>
<p>And up till then, we&rsquo;d used email and we&rsquo;d used Usenet,</p>
<p>the NNTP protocol, we&rsquo;d use news readers, we used FTP,</p>
<p>we used all these old internet protocols,</p>
<p>all relying on the DNS and TCP IP and UDP for that matter.</p>
<p>When I was at Silicon Graphics,</p>
<p>we brought up the whole stack, right?</p>
<p>We had to discover how to find the ethernet addresses</p>
<p>on your network and then find IP addresses for them,</p>
<p>ARP protocol, all that stuff.</p>
<p>And it was great because nobody knew in the 80s</p>
<p>what was gonna win, all the proprietary stacks</p>
<p>like IBM, SNA and DeckNet and all these other protocols</p>
<p>were saying, we&rsquo;re gonna do it</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s gonna be heterogeneous future.</p>
<p>And instead it was Berkeley Unix and the TCP IP stack</p>
<p>that dated back to the ARPANET that won.</p>
<p>And I think we knew it, we all knew it at SGI,</p>
<p>but the salespeople didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And so they kept trying to get multiple network stacks</p>
<p>interoperating, but in the end it won.</p>
<p>And so that was the internet and it was email and texty</p>
<p>and it was used and very texty.</p>
<p>And then Tim Berners Lee did his thing,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think I was paying attention.</p>
<p>And I think the date when he first did it</p>
<p>or when he wrote the famous emails and pushed back to 89,</p>
<p>but I noticed a mosaic in 93 because one of the things</p>
<p>that Mark Andreessen and Eric Bina did at NCSA</p>
<p>was they innovated on the early HTML standard.</p>
<p>They in particular Mark sent this email saying,</p>
<p>hey everybody, we think you should be able</p>
<p>to put an image in a page.</p>
<p>And you know when he sent that Eric Bina had already</p>
<p>written the code.</p>
<p>And I talked to Tim Berners Lee more recently</p>
<p>just a few years ago and he was like,</p>
<p>oh, we had another way of doing it and it didn&rsquo;t work out</p>
<p>because Mark shipped his in mosaic.</p>
<p>And this convinced me of several things.</p>
<p>One, the internet meant there was a huge first mover</p>
<p>advantage and being fast, getting on first mattered a lot.</p>
<p>And so Richard Gabriel of scheme and poetry fame</p>
<p>has written about this, the famous.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s poetry? Well, he&rsquo;s a poet.</p>
<p>Oh, actual poetry.</p>
<p>Is he talking about some kind of something?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s the founder of Lucid,</p>
<p>which is where Jamie Zawinski worked before Netscape.</p>
<p>And Lucid was doing compilers and Lucid Emacs,</p>
<p>which was a fork of Emacs,</p>
<p>famously Jamie fighting against Richard Stallman, Stalmax.</p>
<p>And so Richard Gabriel, very, very brainy computer guy,</p>
<p>but also a poet, but he wrote a nice essay</p>
<p>that gets abused all the time.</p>
<p>In fact, Jamie&rsquo;s put a kind of warning in front</p>
<p>of his version of it on his site,</p>
<p>JWC.org called Worse is Better.</p>
<p>And this is about survival advantage of software</p>
<p>in the network world, in my opinion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about Unix.</p>
<p>It started out being framed as Unix and Lisp,</p>
<p>good news, bad news, because all the Lisp people,</p>
<p>the MIT people were like, oh, you know,</p>
<p>the crown jewel scheme, this Faberge egg or Common Lisp,</p>
<p>this giant cathedral, of course we&rsquo;re going to win.</p>
<p>This is civilization.</p>
<p>And those, you know, those farmers in New Jersey</p>
<p>to borrow from the Sopranos, those picks down at Bell Labs,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just, you know, there&rsquo;s nothing sound there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all hacking.</p>
<p>Well, guess what won?</p>
<p>Wow, so you&rsquo;re saying this is a fundamental,</p>
<p>like principle of the internet is moving fast wins.</p>
<p>You could say in almost any network system,</p>
<p>like in biological evolution,</p>
<p>you see successful alleles sweep populations</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t always have, you know,</p>
<p>they aren&rsquo;t free of flaws.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re heterozygous advantage, right?</p>
<p>You can get both parents give you the gene variant</p>
<p>and you get sickle cell anemia, right?</p>
<p>But if one of them does, you&rsquo;re more resistant to malaria.</p>
<p>And so this isn&rsquo;t a beautiful process,</p>
<p>except at large scale.</p>
<p>And then you realize that because it moves fast</p>
<p>and can adapt, it can win.</p>
<p>And people still struggle with this.</p>
<p>I used to struggle with this</p>
<p>because JavaScript was done in such a hurry</p>
<p>and the force of web compatibility meant</p>
<p>early mistakes couldn&rsquo;t be fixed.</p>
<p>And even the standards process injected new mistakes,</p>
<p>as it will.</p>
<p>But often standards bodies go back</p>
<p>and making compatible changes.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do that with the web.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like, again, like biology,</p>
<p>you preserve what still works.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to break ATP metabolism or whatever.</p>
<p>So you have to kind of resign yourself to the reality</p>
<p>of worse is better being enshrined</p>
<p>in actual design points you might not like.</p>
<p>And that happened with JavaScript and I&rsquo;m way over it,</p>
<p>but it also, I think was a huge advantage.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why JavaScript has kind of swept</p>
<p>a lot of programming domains.</p>
<p>People will say, oh, it&rsquo;s not because of merit.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>But we also improved it over time in the standards body.</p>
<p>I spent 20 years doing that.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t get that choice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m not saying that that was the best language.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying that was the right time to do it.</p>
<p>And I like to say the alternative was not to do it.</p>
<p>I could have told Netscape, I can&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too rushed.</p>
<p>And it would have been visual basic script.</p>
<p>And it would have been bad.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a good way to present the alternative.</p>
<p>But so it was a Netscape and you have written it</p>
<p>in how many days and why was it only that many days?</p>
<p>And what was the goal and the underlying principles</p>
<p>in your mind at the time?</p>
<p>So the whole, I&rsquo;m sort of describing worse is better</p>
<p>in a frenetic way because it fit the model of Netscape.</p>
<p>When it was known that Jim Clark</p>
<p>and Marc Inves were founding Netscape</p>
<p>and they did the first release in 1994,</p>
<p>that browser took over from Mosaic.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s why Mozilla is called that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Mosaic killer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the giant monster that kills Mosaic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>And they knew they could, it wasn&rsquo;t that, again,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re doing advanced scientific research</p>
<p>that is changing the world.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re more like taking down the last iteration</p>
<p>on the browser, Marc did, which had images</p>
<p>and other importances before he stopped working on it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re making Netscape the new thing that has images,</p>
<p>plugins, which was the way to do video back in the day.</p>
<p>It had something that&rsquo;s kind of died now for tiled windows</p>
<p>called frames and frame sets.</p>
<p>HTML tables, that was new.</p>
<p>Eric Bina did tables in Netscape 1.1.</p>
<p>So when I got there, they were heading toward IPO.</p>
<p>Clark wanted the IPO early, I think his instinct was right.</p>
<p>And that kicked off the whole dot com era, right?</p>
<p>There was a recession in the US in 91.</p>
<p>You can see old law and order reruns</p>
<p>where they talk about the recession</p>
<p>and how hard it&rsquo;s hitting New Yorkers.</p>
<p>And after that, Greenspan really goosed things</p>
<p>at the Federal Reserve and technology had been sort of</p>
<p>fermenting in a way that came together with the internet.</p>
<p>And Netscape made it possible to do pets.com,</p>
<p>to do eBay, to get people to recognize a URL on a billboard</p>
<p>and then type it in when they get home.</p>
<p>And that was huge.</p>
<p>That was so fast moving a rocket that Marc</p>
<p>and the engineering team there thought,</p>
<p>we need to make this a programmable browser,</p>
<p>not just a document viewer, not just a video.</p>
<p>It was all HTML with images and tables and also,</p>
<p>like you said, frames.</p>
<p>There was no dynamic element at all.</p>
<p>Yeah, the most dynamism we get was from a plugin,</p>
<p>which there are a few of them then.</p>
<p>Flash didn&rsquo;t exist at that point.</p>
<p>It was, I think.</p>
<p>Java Applets yet or no?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the thing we did to deal with Sun.</p>
<p>In fact, I was recruited to go do Scheme in the browser.</p>
<p>Remember Guy Steele and Gerald Sussman&rsquo;s</p>
<p>beautiful Lisp variant?</p>
<p>I was gonna do it in the browser</p>
<p>because my friends from SG, I thought,</p>
<p>hey, we like Scheme, you like Scheme.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I hardly ever use Scheme.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really used in industry,</p>
<p>except in sort of silos, but I like it.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ll come do Scheme in the browser.</p>
<p>I have a slide from my 2017 talk</p>
<p>where I have Bruce Willis crawling through the duct</p>
<p>in Die Hard.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, come out to the coast, have a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Come on, do Scheme in the browser.</p>
<p>But when I got there, there was no Scheme in the browser</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;d started a deal with Sun Microsystems.</p>
<p>And my best contact there was Bill Joy,</p>
<p>who I admired as a Berkeley Unix founder.</p>
<p>And, you know, Sun founder.</p>
<p>And Bill got the idea of making the browser programmable too.</p>
<p>And so the main idea was to put the Java VM,</p>
<p>which at that point was not really easy to embed,</p>
<p>into Netscape, including the Netscape version on Windows</p>
<p>that was still most popular,</p>
<p>which was the 16 bit Windows 3.1, which was going away.</p>
<p>Microsoft was coming out with Windows 95</p>
<p>and everyone was afraid they were gonna do</p>
<p>Internet Explorer, I guess, two at that point,</p>
<p>three the next year.</p>
<p>They already bought or invested in somehow Spyglass,</p>
<p>this other company that shot out from NCSA</p>
<p>at University of Illinois.</p>
<p>And in fact, Microsoft had tried to buy Netscape</p>
<p>in late 94, before I got there.</p>
<p>And I heard about this later.</p>
<p>I heard they offered way too little money.</p>
<p>And so, you know, Jim Barksdale and Jim Clark said,</p>
<p>get out of here, you know, pound sand.</p>
<p>But then they realized, oh, this is going to hurt us</p>
<p>because now they&rsquo;re gonna copy us.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t happen right away.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure when Gates internet title wave memo</p>
<p>was written.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the famous memo he wrote when Bill Gates realized</p>
<p>that Microsoft was going down this old copy AOL path</p>
<p>or copy CompuServe path, a project called Blackbird,</p>
<p>presumably after the SR71, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But they were gonna make a, you know,</p>
<p>dial up service with a custom content language stack</p>
<p>and custom rendering.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t the web.</p>
<p>You know, they could have content partners.</p>
<p>They have a lot of money,</p>
<p>but it still wasn&rsquo;t to scale the web.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t gonna be compelling.</p>
<p>And Gates realized this,</p>
<p>and he turned the company on a dime</p>
<p>and they couldn&rsquo;t buy Netscape.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not sure the timing,</p>
<p>so they decided to copy it.</p>
<p>And once we realized that everybody inside Netscape</p>
<p>felt even more urgency and more of a frenetic mood.</p>
<p>And so my chance to do scheme disappeared</p>
<p>when the Java deal started brewing.</p>
<p>But there was still a chance to do a companion language</p>
<p>to Java because Java was a compiled,</p>
<p>is a compiled language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s evolved and improved quite a lot since then too,</p>
<p>but it was for sort of serious advanced programmers</p>
<p>that cost a certain salary or hourly rate.</p>
<p>And people observed, Bill Joy observed,</p>
<p>and Mark Andreessen and I observed</p>
<p>that in a mature stack like Microsoft,</p>
<p>you really benefit from having a scripting language</p>
<p>like Visual Basic,</p>
<p>which became Visual Basic script in IE3,</p>
<p>but didn&rsquo;t take over and kill JavaScript,</p>
<p>that you need two languages.</p>
<p>One is for the component writers</p>
<p>who are higher price and more expert.</p>
<p>And the other is for scripters,</p>
<p>certified public accountants, designers,</p>
<p>graphic designers with some programming inclination,</p>
<p>anybody, amateurs, doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a much more demotic approach there</p>
<p>for programming the components together,</p>
<p>gluing them together.</p>
<p>Some people say duct tape language, which I don&rsquo;t really like.</p>
<p>But we saw, Bill Joy and Mark Andreessen and I,</p>
<p>we saw the need for a companion language.</p>
<p>And the gleam in our eye was to call it JavaScript.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t like it, that was marketing&rsquo;s plan.</p>
<p>Mark called it Mocha, which I liked.</p>
<p>And Netscape Marketing, I think, didn&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>So they said, oh, there&rsquo;s some trademark</p>
<p>and some software somewhere that uses Mocha,</p>
<p>so we can&rsquo;t use that.</p>
<p>And they tried LiveScript in August and that didn&rsquo;t last.</p>
<p>And then finally we got the trademark license</p>
<p>in December 1995.</p>
<p>But the work I did to prove that it could be done</p>
<p>was important because I came in in April</p>
<p>and even then Netscape was growing so fast</p>
<p>that they couldn&rsquo;t find an open hiring requisition</p>
<p>in the client team for me.</p>
<p>So they hired me into the server team.</p>
<p>And I worked for a month on server team</p>
<p>on what became HTTP 1.1.</p>
<p>So I was actually, I had done protocol work</p>
<p>at Silicon Graphics with Greg Chesson,</p>
<p>former Bell Labs intern, grad student intern</p>
<p>who knew all the Unix founders.</p>
<p>And Greg was very interested in taking protocols</p>
<p>to the next level with VLSI,</p>
<p>because he thought that CPUs wouldn&rsquo;t scale up.</p>
<p>He was mistaken in that, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Moore&rsquo;s law more than kept up.</p>
<p>And you have gigabit ethernet running</p>
<p>with conventional processors.</p>
<p>But I worked on protocols at SGI</p>
<p>as well as Unix kernel hacking and NFS and things like that.</p>
<p>So I came into Netscape to work on the server side</p>
<p>for a month, but I was thinking the whole time,</p>
<p>what should this language be like?</p>
<p>Should it be easy to use?</p>
<p>Might its syntax even be more like natural language</p>
<p>like HyperTalk, which is Bill Atkinson&rsquo;s language</p>
<p>in HyperCard, if you ever used HyperCard on an early Mac.</p>
<p>And I thought, well, I&rsquo;d like to do that,</p>
<p>but my management is saying, make it look like Java,</p>
<p>which looks like C from a distance.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>Is it braces?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about visually?</p>
<p>Does that mean like, management,</p>
<p>do they understand what they think about?</p>
<p>Marketing didn&rsquo;t know, but management did.</p>
<p>Like Rick Schell, the VP of engineering, knew.</p>
<p>And we had a plan even that was,</p>
<p>if you have this companion language,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to glue things together</p>
<p>between Java and JavaScript.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to have commerce in memory, in the heap</p>
<p>with data types.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to want some of the data types</p>
<p>in Java to reflect in the JavaScript.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to want the primitive types</p>
<p>that Java unfortunately separated from objects.</p>
<p>So at least some of them, double, let&rsquo;s call it</p>
<p>in Java&rsquo;s terms from the C term</p>
<p>for double precision floating point,</p>
<p>or strings or Booleans and objects.</p>
<p>And so right away there was this constraint</p>
<p>that looking like Java meant kind of a C curly brace syntax</p>
<p>but also some of the data types and objects.</p>
<p>Like objects and so on, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Comparison operator.</p>
<p>Garbage collection, all that stuff.</p>
<p>Even the bitwise operators and the shift operators</p>
<p>including the unsigned right shift,</p>
<p>which Java had because it didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>unsigned integer types.</p>
<p>It said, if you want to do unsigned operations,</p>
<p>use an operator.</p>
<p>And that turned out to be important much later.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell that story five time.</p>
<p>But JavaScript inherited a set of operators,</p>
<p>the expression grammar, the statement grammar</p>
<p>up to a point from Java.</p>
<p>But I wanted a functional language.</p>
<p>I wanted scheme, a little bit of scheme,</p>
<p>even though it wasn&rsquo;t as clean as scheme.</p>
<p>I wanted.</p>
<p>So you had a love, sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>You had a love for scheme and list</p>
<p>but that functional language landscape.</p>
<p>Yes, I wanted first class functions</p>
<p>because I saw the need for callbacks in the browser</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s a single threaded program.</p>
<p>All the early browsers were single threaded</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the right model for users.</p>
<p>Most users weren&rsquo;t ready for mutual exclusion</p>
<p>and threading.</p>
<p>So in a single threaded world,</p>
<p>you cannot block the user interface.</p>
<p>So you have to use a callback and run later.</p>
<p>And without getting too fancy</p>
<p>and trying to capture the continuation</p>
<p>like call CC does in scheme,</p>
<p>I thought I&rsquo;ll just make it easy to have fun arcs.</p>
<p>First class functions you pass downward</p>
<p>and it can call back, it&rsquo;d be called back.</p>
<p>And Java didn&rsquo;t have that at the time.</p>
<p>It took forever to get proper first class functions</p>
<p>or lambdas now into Java, Java seven or eight, I think.</p>
<p>It did have concurrency, right?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>From the very beginning.</p>
<p>But you were thinking that the JavaScript</p>
<p>in the browser would not have the luxury</p>
<p>of being concurrent.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And the reason was Java was gonna run in the plugins.</p>
<p>So it could fork threads and go to town.</p>
<p>But the main action in the browser</p>
<p>was in the single threaded program,</p>
<p>the single Unix process on Unix or Windows.</p>
<p>And it was where you had to service the event loop</p>
<p>and then go do things.</p>
<p>Respond to the network layout, some HTML, render it,</p>
<p>turn widths into heights by filling containers, boxes,</p>
<p>the early, what became the CSS box model.</p>
<p>And run scripts to make the thing livelier,</p>
<p>respond to user input.</p>
<p>And all that event driven programming</p>
<p>was in part like HyperCard</p>
<p>because HyperCard had this on event name syntax.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why you have in JavaScript on click</p>
<p>run together as the name of the event handler.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some funny ones on mouse over</p>
<p>and on mouse out, people still complain about those.</p>
<p>But there were many more events now over the years</p>
<p>standardized, but it was a mix of event driven</p>
<p>single threaded programming because it had to run</p>
<p>in the main thread of the browser where the action is</p>
<p>and Java never got there.</p>
<p>Which meant Java could not interact easily</p>
<p>or quickly or in a nested way with the document,</p>
<p>with the objects reflected from the HTML document,</p>
<p>with the tables and forms and so on.</p>
<p>And that is one of the reasons I think JavaScript</p>
<p>survived and Java kind of died.</p>
<p>Java was in this plugin prison.</p>
<p>It essentially was confined to a rectangle,</p>
<p>the applet rectangle.</p>
<p>And while we even built next year,</p>
<p>Nick Thompson, a friend from SGI</p>
<p>who was an intern grad student at CMU at the time,</p>
<p>built the first version of Live Connect</p>
<p>to glue Java and JavaScript together</p>
<p>to deliver on that vision where you do have commerce</p>
<p>between the data types in the heap.</p>
<p>Did it work?</p>
<p>It worked, but Java was in charge.</p>
<p>JavaScript was in charge and Java was just these components,</p>
<p>these helper objects.</p>
<p>You might as well do everything in JavaScript.</p>
<p>What happened over time, it&rsquo;s like an evolutionary filter.</p>
<p>It just kind of, who needs the plugin?</p>
<p>And in fact, Sun mismanaged Java as a plugin.</p>
<p>They thought, oh, Netscape is giving us</p>
<p>the distribution vehicle and we don&rsquo;t care about the browser.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just about getting Java out there.</p>
<p>And that was a big miscalculation.</p>
<p>They then tried, because Microsoft&rsquo;s killing Netscape</p>
<p>after years, they tried getting into Microsoft.</p>
<p>And you may remember there was a Sun Microsoft deal</p>
<p>which famously blew up.</p>
<p>And Microsoft kicked Java out of Windows.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when they really pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;d already evaluated it and liked it</p>
<p>on Anders Helzberg&rsquo;s.NET and C Sharp</p>
<p>and decided we&rsquo;re gonna just not have Java.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want any of that Sun stuff.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want the patent risk.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want, I&rsquo;m not sure what all fights were about.</p>
<p>There was some patent angle to it, I think.</p>
<p>And up till then, Microsoft had been using Java components</p>
<p>like in Outlook Web Access,</p>
<p>which had a lot of JavaScript to be a webmail</p>
<p>like Hotmail, like user interface.</p>
<p>They had to call the mail server through HTTP</p>
<p>and they used a Java object to do this.</p>
<p>And when they gave the boot to Sun,</p>
<p>suddenly the left hand gave the boot</p>
<p>and the right hand said, we better do something else</p>
<p>in Outlook Web Access.</p>
<p>What are we gonna do?</p>
<p>And they said, let&rsquo;s just add an ActiveX component,</p>
<p>which is their own native way of embedding things</p>
<p>in languages and it&rsquo;ll be what became XML HTTP request,</p>
<p>which is now a web standard for calling asynchronously.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been replaced by the fetch API</p>
<p>in HTML5 or HTML living document.</p>
<p>But this whole lineage goes back to Java</p>
<p>being successfully the loser and getting kicked out.</p>
<p>And after Microsoft kicked it out, it was a plugin</p>
<p>and you would find it required for like smart card banking</p>
<p>in the Nordic countries where that was mandated by law,</p>
<p>but really didn&rsquo;t get used much.</p>
<p>Or there were pilots who used it for flight information,</p>
<p>but Flash, which Netscape could have bought,</p>
<p>but fortunately didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The early days.</p>
<p>Yeah, we would have screwed it up.</p>
<p>What year are we talking about with Flash?</p>
<p>I think after the IPO, so it was probably late 95.</p>
<p>Oh, Flash was around.</p>
<p>Was it Adobe?</p>
<p>No, it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>No, it was called Future Splash</p>
<p>and it was these brothers, Jonathan Gay,</p>
<p>I think his name was, and he came knocking</p>
<p>and the marketing guy at Netscape,</p>
<p>who was screening the technology partners</p>
<p>or wannabe acquisitions was brutal</p>
<p>and just everybody wanted to get in on the Netscape,</p>
<p>stock gravy train and he sent them packing</p>
<p>and they ended up selling to Macromedia</p>
<p>and Macromedia was where Flash was created.</p>
<p>And the good thing about Macromedia was</p>
<p>it was a tool company.</p>
<p>So it invested in the best ideas, I think,</p>
<p>which are still somewhat lost to us of Flash,</p>
<p>the timeline, animation has sort of been a mutable function</p>
<p>over time.</p>
<p>They had the tooling around that too,</p>
<p>like they had Dreamweaver, there&rsquo;s a Flash.</p>
<p>Flash Director, there were a bunch of them.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, yeah, that was a great.</p>
<p>Flash Builder was one of the last ones.</p>
<p>These tools were used by real artists</p>
<p>and special effects people and designers.</p>
<p>All the restaurant websites around 2005</p>
<p>were done in Flash, which was,</p>
<p>we were trying to do HTML5 at the same time.</p>
<p>That was the Firefox era.</p>
<p>We were trying to make the web capable enough</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t need Flash, but if you recall,</p>
<p>you go to a restaurant and it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>this is kind of like a game or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a Flash, all the font looks small.</p>
<p>So you didn&rsquo;t like Flash from the beginning.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, this doesn&rsquo;t feel right.</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>I actually admire Flash&rsquo;s technology</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m pretty pragmatic about these things.</p>
<p>And I realized that it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>if your Delta bad hand like JavaScript was a rush job,</p>
<p>or if you have Flash as a plugin</p>
<p>and you can invest in the tools and make it pretty good.</p>
<p>You should make it better for your users</p>
<p>and grow it as best you can.</p>
<p>And what happened with the browser</p>
<p>due to Microsoft&rsquo;s monopoly abuse</p>
<p>for which they were convicted.</p>
<p>And even after that, until I think Firefox and then Chrome</p>
<p>was people kept saying, oh, the web can&rsquo;t do X, can&rsquo;t do Y.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have to have a plugin.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have to have a new approach.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll clean the slate and have a new web.</p>
<p>And everyone who said that failed.</p>
<p>And the reason they failed is because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s too much value in the web, this huge network.</p>
<p>And the worse is better principle means</p>
<p>that you can not only start bad, which they all sneer at,</p>
<p>but get on first and get wide distribution,</p>
<p>get sort of evolutionary advantage in priority of place,</p>
<p>but you can also improve it over time.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re gonna improve Flash,</p>
<p>and for some reason Flash is now out of favor.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs said you can&rsquo;t have Flash on the iPhone.</p>
<p>That was probably the death knell.</p>
<p>Put your energy into JavaScript.</p>
<p>And that happened, right?</p>
<p>So we did things at Mozilla with Adobe to improve,</p>
<p>which bought my Macromedia, to improve Flash</p>
<p>and to improve the version of JavaScript that was in Flash.</p>
<p>We tried to standardize that.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting ahead of myself with it.</p>
<p>It was ES4.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Can we just rewind to the magical, like, you know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a special moment in the history of all of computing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about it later, but it&rsquo;s arguable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that the entirety of the world</p>
<p>will run in JavaScript at some point.</p>
<p>So like, it&rsquo;s like those days,</p>
<p>it would be interesting if you could just describe,</p>
<p>actually zooming in on how the cake was baked</p>
<p>from the several days that you were working on it.</p>
<p>What was on your mind?</p>
<p>How much coffee were you drinking?</p>
<p>Were you nervous?</p>
<p>Why, freaking out?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to remember it.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>There are these pregnant moments you see in hindsight,</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re overrated,</p>
<p>but like Hegel sees Napoleon on horseback at Jena</p>
<p>and says, there&rsquo;s the world spirit on horse.</p>
<p>And I knew that there was a chance to do it.</p>
<p>Mark knew, and he was my executive sponsor</p>
<p>and he was the one sort of brainstorming</p>
<p>how the JavaScript should be right there in the page.</p>
<p>That was important for him to say that.</p>
<p>Cause I thought so too, but a lot of people were like,</p>
<p>well, you can&rsquo;t write programming language</p>
<p>in the middle of the markup.</p>
<p>And indeed there are problems.</p>
<p>If you did it naively, you&rsquo;d see the code laid out</p>
<p>as like random gibberish.</p>
<p>So I had to figure out how to hide that.</p>
<p>That was a challenge.</p>
<p>Is that a breakthrough idea?</p>
<p>I mean, so you and Mark thinking about this idea</p>
<p>that you just inject code in the middle of the markup.</p>
<p>Of the webpage.</p>
<p>I consider kind of heretical.</p>
<p>There was an SGML guru, I forget his name,</p>
<p>but he corresponded with me and at first he was angry.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, you should have used a marked section.</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t you use a marked section?</p>
<p>And I said, well, SGML marked sections are not part of HTML</p>
<p>by the way, and they&rsquo;re not supported in the browser.</p>
<p>And so I did some hack that was equivalent</p>
<p>and over time you could do the proper SGML thing.</p>
<p>But eventually he came around and it was again,</p>
<p>sort of evolutionary necessity.</p>
<p>It was almost like introgression, like the idea</p>
<p>which Lynn Margulies, I think helped get across</p>
<p>that we have to consider mutualism biology</p>
<p>that maybe mitochondria were ancient prokaryotes</p>
<p>that got into the cell and became beneficial.</p>
<p>Somehow the same sort of thinking applies.</p>
<p>You have to embed JavaScript in HTML.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be a good virus.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t hurt you.</p>
<p>The code becomes data in the sense</p>
<p>it just gets carried along.</p>
<p>But is there the side of the, so you were focusing</p>
<p>on Netscape at that time.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t the browser have to support interpret correctly</p>
<p>this mix of HTML and whatever code?</p>
<p>I had to hide it from old browsers,</p>
<p>including Netscape 1.1, which was predominant then.</p>
<p>So I used an HTML comment, but the inside the container</p>
<p>that comment lived in the script tag,</p>
<p>which is a new element, I could make different semantics</p>
<p>in Netscape 2 where those HTML comment delimiters</p>
<p>instead of being multi line brackets became one line</p>
<p>or essentially one line.</p>
<p>So you wrote, so JavaScript was written,</p>
<p>the programming language was written as a comment.</p>
<p>A comment for old browsers and a set of brackets</p>
<p>that were ignored with real code for new.</p>
<p>And it was this two way comment hiding hack, as I called it,</p>
<p>that was absolutely necessary for us to get off the ground.</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t have bootstrapped JavaScript without it.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have scripts that were loaded from a separate file.</p>
<p>The only scripts in Netscape 2 were inline in the document.</p>
<p>What were the challenges here?</p>
<p>What, like what, you know, typing,</p>
<p>what were the choices you were thinking about?</p>
<p>What was the design for this garbage collection?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have time to write a garbage collector.</p>
<p>So I just, I didn&rsquo;t at first.</p>
<p>The thing was using essentially arenas</p>
<p>or what GNU calls object pools</p>
<p>and just would run out of memory eventually.</p>
<p>And I added reference counting in a hurry</p>
<p>after the 10 days in which I hacked.</p>
<p>So after I was in the server team doing HTTP 1.1</p>
<p>and thinking about the language,</p>
<p>I finally got transferred to the client team in early May.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when I, you know, I got the go sign from Mark</p>
<p>and it was like, we can&rsquo;t wait</p>
<p>because people inside Netscape are doubting.</p>
<p>Even people inside Sun are definitely doubting.</p>
<p>Bill Joy was the champion, but he was like alone in that</p>
<p>in seeing that there was a role for JavaScript</p>
<p>as the, as I call it, the sidekick language,</p>
<p>robbing the boy hostage.</p>
<p>Frank Miller put it in the Dark Knight Returns</p>
<p>that there was this silly little language</p>
<p>that would be the glue language</p>
<p>and it could become important over time.</p>
<p>And you were better off having that complementarity,</p>
<p>that pairing of languages,</p>
<p>just like Microsoft stacked it with visual C plus plus</p>
<p>and visual pacing.</p>
<p>So what was the big moment of I&rsquo;m done?</p>
<p>So I had to do a demo.</p>
<p>I forget the dates.</p>
<p>I think I, for a history of programming languages paper</p>
<p>that Alan Wiersbrock did with my help,</p>
<p>he did a lot of the writing.</p>
<p>I think it was the 10 days from like Thursday evening</p>
<p>through to the following weeks, you know,</p>
<p>the whole of that week and then into the Monday.</p>
<p>You get sleep?</p>
<p>Not enough.</p>
<p>And I was really going fast</p>
<p>because I had already used a lot of C compiler</p>
<p>and front end compiler knowledge</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d gained from undergraduate school.</p>
<p>When I started getting into computing</p>
<p>as a renegade physics major,</p>
<p>people were formalizing more efficient bottom up grammars,</p>
<p>parsers for bottom up languages,</p>
<p>really LALR one was the big thing.</p>
<p>And I studied all this and learned how to parse them.</p>
<p>And in the end, if you&rsquo;re doing C languages,</p>
<p>you often do what Dennis Ritchie did anyway,</p>
<p>which is the recursive descent parser.</p>
<p>You can hand code it.</p>
<p>And I did that for JavaScript in a blazing hurry,</p>
<p>mostly got it right.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have precedence inversion problems or other bugs,</p>
<p>but I copied a lot from Java and C.</p>
<p>And I tried to keep things simple,</p>
<p>like the equality operator in those 10 days sprint</p>
<p>between two objects of different dynamic type said,</p>
<p>no, they&rsquo;re not equal, their types are different.</p>
<p>And then after that, I had internal early adopters</p>
<p>and they were using JavaScript to match a number</p>
<p>against a database field that had been stringized.</p>
<p>And they said, oh, can we just have implicit conversion?</p>
<p>Like an idiot, I agreed.</p>
<p>I gave them what they wanted.</p>
<p>I was trying to please them and get adoption.</p>
<p>And that broke what equivalence relation</p>
<p>nature there was to the double equal.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some edge cases with not a number</p>
<p>that break that too, but it really broke it.</p>
<p>Having an implicit conversions in the operator</p>
<p>is something that people still roast me over.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about two things.</p>
<p>One, it sounds like the comparison operator,</p>
<p>the equality operator is the thing that you regret.</p>
<p>So maybe you can.</p>
<p>Making it sloppy.</p>
<p>So what is the biggest thing you regret in those 10 days?</p>
<p>And what is the biggest thing you&rsquo;re proud of?</p>
<p>So that making it sloppy came after the 10 days.</p>
<p>And my lesson there, which I&rsquo;ve tweeted is</p>
<p>when people come to you saying,</p>
<p>can you please make it sloppy or add this cute feature?</p>
<p>The answer should be no.</p>
<p>And I should have known that</p>
<p>because I think Nicholas Viert, one of my heroes said,</p>
<p>the essence of design is leaving things out.</p>
<p>But during the 10 days, I also, like I said,</p>
<p>I was in such a hurry, I left out garbage collection,</p>
<p>came back to haunt me, but I got reference counting in</p>
<p>in time that people weren&rsquo;t running out of memory</p>
<p>right away on long lived JavaScript.</p>
<p>What happens when you don&rsquo;t have garbage collection</p>
<p>and you have objects?</p>
<p>Well, you just run out of memory.</p>
<p>And you know, at first you write a short script</p>
<p>and the page doesn&rsquo;t last long or it doesn&rsquo;t do a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Oh, I see, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re writing a game or something</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing event based allocation,</p>
<p>you run out of memory.</p>
<p>And this was noticed in the summer of 1985</p>
<p>and people were like, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I better go back and do reference counting.</p>
<p>And then the problem with reference counting is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re writing the language in the runtime in C,</p>
<p>an unsafe language, and if you&rsquo;re reference counting</p>
<p>and you overflow the counter, you mismanage it</p>
<p>so it goes high, it gets stuck high,</p>
<p>you leak memory again and you run out.</p>
<p>If you underflow it, you pre memory that&rsquo;s still in use.</p>
<p>And even then we knew what all the security hackers</p>
<p>came to know that you therefore have potentially</p>
<p>a remote code execution vulnerability.</p>
<p>Cause this was before things like non executable</p>
<p>heap memory and staff defenses against taking over memory.</p>
<p>So if you can, from the remote side,</p>
<p>write some HTML and JavaScript that just happens</p>
<p>to exploit a bug in memory safety,</p>
<p>like it causes JavaScript to underflow reference counter.</p>
<p>And the script still has its hands on that object</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s trying to call a method on it</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some kind of lookup function table</p>
<p>in the object, but you&rsquo;ve managed to stuff the heap</p>
<p>with strings that forwards their own lookalike</p>
<p>for the function table.</p>
<p>You can call some other code.</p>
<p>And this was a problem right away.</p>
<p>So security, JavaScript upped the ante.</p>
<p>Java had this problem too, but in its own VM.</p>
<p>And it just was a separate headache for Sun to worry about.</p>
<p>We had this problem in Netscape right away.</p>
<p>So Netscape 2 came out after my 10 days</p>
<p>and after these follow on work to embed JavaScript</p>
<p>better in the browser and to add garbage</p>
<p>or collection through reference counting,</p>
<p>really I call it reference counting and get it shipped.</p>
<p>We had a bunch of dot releases where we fixed</p>
<p>security bugs like maniacs.</p>
<p>But what is the thing you&rsquo;re, you know,</p>
<p>when you sit back on a porch and just look out</p>
<p>into the sunset, what are you most proud of</p>
<p>from those 10 days?</p>
<p>I think the first class functions shines.</p>
<p>I think especially since Java didn&rsquo;t have it</p>
<p>and it was somewhat unusual.</p>
<p>Scheme made it in somehow at the end of the day.</p>
<p>In spirit, I mean, people complain because Scheme has,</p>
<p>you know, minimalism.</p>
<p>It has, you know, six or seven special forms.</p>
<p>It has hygienic macros.</p>
<p>It has call CC.</p>
<p>It has sort of a beautiful complete set of forms</p>
<p>to make the land of calculus pleasant to use in practice.</p>
<p>And JavaScript is, you know, kind of a multi paradigm</p>
<p>or shambolic.</p>
<p>Just in a small tangent, you mentioned Mark Andreessen.</p>
<p>It sounds like, and Bill Joy, but staying on Mark,</p>
<p>it sounds like he had an impact on you</p>
<p>in that he sort of believed in what you were doing there.</p>
<p>Can you talk about like what role Mark had in your life?</p>
<p>Yeah, we would meet at the Peninsula Creamery</p>
<p>in downtown Palo Alto.</p>
<p>And Mark was just fresh out of, you know, grad school</p>
<p>or whatever he was doing and he was big dude</p>
<p>and he got fitter later.</p>
<p>He had hair, he would order giant milkshakes and burgers</p>
<p>and we would meet there and brainstorm about what to do.</p>
<p>And it was very direct because we didn&rsquo;t have much time.</p>
<p>The sort of, we didn&rsquo;t talk about it.</p>
<p>The implication was Microsoft was coming after us.</p>
<p>Mark was saying things boldly pre IPO</p>
<p>like Netscape plus Java kills Windows, right?</p>
<p>This is, make a browser programmable.</p>
<p>It becomes the new runtime for programs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the meta OS or it&rsquo;s the replacement OS.</p>
<p>But he still saw value in JavaScript.</p>
<p>Yes, even though he was saying that</p>
<p>and Java was the big name, hence the trademark license,</p>
<p>he saw JavaScript as important.</p>
<p>And he even thought, what if we got,</p>
<p>I told this in other interviews, I can say it.</p>
<p>He thought, what if we had my friend Kip Hickman</p>
<p>who&rsquo;d been at Netscape from the beginning</p>
<p>and who was a kernel hacker at SGI when I joined,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d started writing his own JVM</p>
<p>before we consummated the Sun deal</p>
<p>and got our hands on their code.</p>
<p>And the Java compiler, Java C,</p>
<p>which Arthur Van Hoff had written very nice code,</p>
<p>was all written in Java.</p>
<p>It was self hosted or so called bootstrap.</p>
<p>And so we could use that as soon as Kip&rsquo;s Java VM</p>
<p>could run the bytecode from the Sun JVM</p>
<p>running the self hosted compiler to emit the bytecode.</p>
<p>So once we could bootstrap into Kip&rsquo;s VM,</p>
<p>we wouldn&rsquo;t need Sun.</p>
<p>And Mark was like, well, maybe we can just ditch Sun.</p>
<p>Well, if Kip&rsquo;s Java VM, or if you&rsquo;re a JavaScript VM,</p>
<p>now we need graphics.</p>
<p>So Mark was thinking far ahead</p>
<p>because he knew you could do things with HTML and images,</p>
<p>but at some point you really want.</p>
<p>Like dynamic graphics or three dimensional?</p>
<p>Even SGI had already started its downfall</p>
<p>because the first floor VLSI team there</p>
<p>had gone off to do 3D effects</p>
<p>and all these other companies</p>
<p>that made the graphics card on your PC, right?</p>
<p>Doom was big and Quake.</p>
<p>And so you were, we were all playing Quake.</p>
<p>I was old, so I was terrible.</p>
<p>But why not put that graphics capability on the web?</p>
<p>And in fact, it finally happened at Mozilla</p>
<p>with Firefox era with Vlad Vukicovic</p>
<p>taking OpenGL ES and reflecting it as WebGL.</p>
<p>But OpenGL ES is the mobile version of OpenGL,</p>
<p>which is a standard based on SGI GL.</p>
<p>So this whole lineage of graphics libraries</p>
<p>or really graphics languages for what became the GPU.</p>
<p>And Mark was thinking ahead.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, we need graphics too.</p>
<p>And I thought, okay, I can try to get somebody I knew at SGI,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s a grad student at MIT.</p>
<p>He was studying under Barbara Liskov.</p>
<p>He laughed when he heard about this later, Andrew Myers.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s at Cornell, long time, I think he&rsquo;s a full professor.</p>
<p>And Mark said, great, we&rsquo;ll get him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure he&rsquo;s gonna come.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll throw money, we&rsquo;ll stock options.</p>
<p>We never did it.</p>
<p>And they did the Sun deal.</p>
<p>So Kip Nobly put aside his own JVM</p>
<p>and we used the Sun JVM.</p>
<p>So that was an ambitious period.</p>
<p>And Mark was very generative because he was pushing hard.</p>
<p>He was ambitious and he wanted to have Netscape</p>
<p>possibly be in control of the ball.</p>
<p>Maybe you can speak to this dance</p>
<p>of Netscape versus Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve thrown some loving words towards Microsoft</p>
<p>throughout this conversation,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a theme with, I mean, Steve Jobs</p>
<p>has a similar sort of commentary.</p>
<p>From a big sort of philosophical principle perspective,</p>
<p>can you comment on like the approach</p>
<p>that Microsoft has taken with Internet Explorer</p>
<p>from IE1 to Edge today?</p>
<p>Is there something that you see as valuable</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re doing in the occasional copying</p>
<p>and that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>Or is it, is the world worse off</p>
<p>because Internet Explorer exists?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna segment this into historical areas</p>
<p>because I think Microsoft today with Satya</p>
<p>is quite a different company</p>
<p>and what they&rsquo;re doing with Edge is different.</p>
<p>But back then, Gates, aggressive character,</p>
<p>not really original in my view, not an originator.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs famously said once,</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t have any taste</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t mean this in a small way, he has no taste.</p>
<p>You can see this, Apple at the time had beautiful typography</p>
<p>and ligatures and kerning and the fonts looked great.</p>
<p>And Windows had this sort of ugly system font</p>
<p>that was carefully aligned with Pixel</p>
<p>so it didn&rsquo;t get anything.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to keep interrupting,</p>
<p>but why was Internet Explorer winning</p>
<p>throughout the history of these competitions?</p>
<p>Distribution.</p>
<p>Distribution matters more than anything.</p>
<p>And this is why even now we&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>in the browser wars Edge doing better</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s being foisted on people of Windows.</p>
<p>We have Windows 10 boxes at home.</p>
<p>We have some Windows 7 boxes or laptops we keep running to</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t connect them to the internet generally.</p>
<p>But once you have that operating system to hold,</p>
<p>you can force Edge.</p>
<p>And Apple did it with Safari too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not unique to Microsoft.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sad.</p>
<p>But distribution matters.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think IE was going to win.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why everybody at Netscape felt we&rsquo;re doomed.</p>
<p>This was something Michael Toy and Jamie Woodson were doomed.</p>
<p>But for a while there we had a chance</p>
<p>and we innovated in Netscape too.</p>
<p>We did a big platform push, Java and JavaScript</p>
<p>and plugins, more plugins and more HTML table features.</p>
<p>And really started making a programmable stack</p>
<p>out of what were pretty static web languages.</p>
<p>And even in the beta releases of Netscape,</p>
<p>two people were using JavaScript</p>
<p>to build what you would call single page applications</p>
<p>like Gmail.</p>
<p>And they were using JavaScript locally to compute things</p>
<p>and to call the server on a hidden frame in the background.</p>
<p>So it was prefiguring a lot of what came later as AJAX</p>
<p>or dynamic JavaScript, dynamic HTML.</p>
<p>So people saw that, I mean.</p>
<p>Even then they saw it, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But from my perspective, that seems quite brilliant.</p>
<p>It seems like really innovative</p>
<p>that you would have code run in the browser.</p>
<p>It did impress me with something</p>
<p>which I learned later about from Eric Von Hippel of MIT,</p>
<p>which is user innovation networks, lead user effects.</p>
<p>That throwing out JavaScript,</p>
<p>even though we weren&rsquo;t doing open source,</p>
<p>we were doing beta releases early</p>
<p>and permissively with Netscape.</p>
<p>Getting early developer feedback, absolutely critical.</p>
<p>I loved it.</p>
<p>I did some of that with SGI</p>
<p>with some of the products I worked on,</p>
<p>but it really came to the fore in Netscape.</p>
<p>And that culminated in Mozilla</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re dealing with developers all the time</p>
<p>and early adopters, lead users.</p>
<p>But the lead users helped improve JavaScript,</p>
<p>even in those last few betas</p>
<p>where I could hardly change things.</p>
<p>I was under pretty rigid change control.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about just a small collection</p>
<p>of individuals that are just like upfront.</p>
<p>A guy named Bill Dorch.</p>
<p>You can find his work in the web archives,</p>
<p>still from 1996.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a single page application.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an artist gallery of mountain art.</p>
<p>He used JavaScript?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t quite work.</p>
<p>He uses JavaScript locally.</p>
<p>He uses a local database.</p>
<p>What you would think of now is JSON,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all pure JavaScript code,</p>
<p>a bunch of objects being constructed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so cool.</p>
<p>So how is, if you can do sort of a big sweeping progress</p>
<p>of JavaScript, how has JavaScript changed over the years?</p>
<p>Any of you from those early 10 days</p>
<p>with a quick addition of garbage collection</p>
<p>and fixes around security,</p>
<p>how has this evolution that now it&rsquo;s taken over the world?</p>
<p>In this, it&rsquo;s been a bumpy ride</p>
<p>because the standards body got shut down after Microsoft,</p>
<p>I think, took over the web and then felt punished</p>
<p>by the USB Microsoft antitrust case.</p>
<p>Can you speak to the standard body?</p>
<p>That was a fun ride too</p>
<p>because Netscape had taken the lead</p>
<p>with the web and HTML innovations</p>
<p>like frames and framesets tables.</p>
<p>And the W3C was sort of off even then,</p>
<p>sort of in SGML land heading toward XML, la la land.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be a little harsh on it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s SGML?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>SGML was the precursor markup language to HTML.</p>
<p>It was sort of the more extensible standards,</p>
<p>generalized markup language.</p>
<p>It was a&hellip;</p>
<p>XML like&hellip;</p>
<p>Pointy brackets, but it had all sorts of elaborate syntax</p>
<p>for doing different semantics.</p>
<p>And this is why I think TBL and others</p>
<p>who wanted to do the semantic web then took XML forward,</p>
<p>but they had this, or some of them anyway,</p>
<p>had this strange idea they could replace the web with XML</p>
<p>or that they would upgrade the web to be XML.</p>
<p>And it couldn&rsquo;t be done.</p>
<p>Worse is better had concrete meaning.</p>
<p>The web was very forgiving of HTML,</p>
<p>including sort of minor syntax errors</p>
<p>that could be error corrected.</p>
<p>Like error correction isn&rsquo;t generally done</p>
<p>in programming languages because&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another amazing thing about HTML is like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more like biology than programming.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And so XML was in its standard form super strict</p>
<p>and could never have admitted the kind of users</p>
<p>who were committing these errors.</p>
<p>And the funniest part was Microsoft said,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;re doing XML,</p>
<p>but the way they put it in Internet Explorer</p>
<p>under the default media type,</p>
<p>put it through the HTML error corrector.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>So they kind of bastardized it to make it popular</p>
<p>and usable and accessible.</p>
<p>And so XML as a pure thing was never gonna take over.</p>
<p>And what W3C was kind of not fully functional</p>
<p>because Netscape wasn&rsquo;t cooperating with them.</p>
<p>We thought about where to take JavaScript</p>
<p>and we realized our standards,</p>
<p>Guru Kargal realized there was a European standards body</p>
<p>that had already given Microsoft fits</p>
<p>by standardizing parts of the Windows 3.1 API,</p>
<p>which European governments insisted on.</p>
<p>They said, Microsoft, we can&rsquo;t use your operating system</p>
<p>without some standards.</p>
<p>And Microsoft said, here&rsquo;s our docs.</p>
<p>And the government said, no, we need a European standard.</p>
<p>So this body called</p>
<p>the European Computer Manufacturers Association, ECMA,</p>
<p>which eventually became global</p>
<p>and became a proper noun instead of an acronym.</p>
<p>Right, it&rsquo;s just one capital E now with a lowercase CMA.</p>
<p>Right, and as one of the early Microsoft guys I met</p>
<p>when we first convened a working group</p>
<p>to talk about JavaScript said,</p>
<p>it sounds like a skin disease.</p>
<p>But it gave, I mean, maybe you&rsquo;ll speak to that,</p>
<p>but it gave the name to JavaScript of ECMA script.</p>
<p>That was the standard name</p>
<p>because Java was a trademark of Suns.</p>
<p>They were so aggressive,</p>
<p>they were sending cease and desist letters</p>
<p>to people whose middle European heritage</p>
<p>meant their surname was Javanko</p>
<p>and they called their website javanko.com</p>
<p>and Sunwood sent them a letter saying,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re using J A V A at the start of your domain name,</p>
<p>you must cease and desist.</p>
<p>I love marketing more than anything else in this world.</p>
<p>So ECMA script and now is popularly named as ES plus version.</p>
<p>I would say people use JS more than anything.</p>
<p>People still say JavaScript.</p>
<p>JavaScript is in all the books.</p>
<p>So I mean, when you&rsquo;re referring to it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s usually JavaScript.</p>
<p>And when you wanna refer to a version of JavaScript,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll say ES6, ES5.</p>
<p>Yes, or now they&rsquo;ve gone to years,</p>
<p>which is kind of confusing</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s an offset of 2009, ES6, ES 2016.</p>
<p>Yeah, it doesn&rsquo;t match the years perfectly.</p>
<p>Yeah, so what were the choices made</p>
<p>and how did JavaScript evolve here?</p>
<p>So we took this new standards body,</p>
<p>which we thought sort of a proven record</p>
<p>of standing up to Microsoft,</p>
<p>but Microsoft sent a lot of people.</p>
<p>They sent some people who were pretty good.</p>
<p>And then when they realized that I was there</p>
<p>and Netscape was not gonna just bend over</p>
<p>and do whatever they wanted,</p>
<p>they sent somebody really good.</p>
<p>And he was a smart guy.</p>
<p>He did a lot of the work on the first draft of the spec.</p>
<p>Sean Katzenberger, he&rsquo;s left Microsoft.</p>
<p>He even did what I sort of did.</p>
<p>He told his bosses, stop bugging me to do other things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m focused on this.</p>
<p>Cause it took a lot of focused work</p>
<p>to create the first draft of the spec.</p>
<p>And I was still holding,</p>
<p>I was spending almost all the plates.</p>
<p>I had like part time help in certain areas.</p>
<p>And on the front end integrations,</p>
<p>I had the front end guys.</p>
<p>But I couldn&rsquo;t take as much time as Sean was</p>
<p>to write the draft spec,</p>
<p>but I had to participate</p>
<p>because I was essentially helping write down</p>
<p>what the language did</p>
<p>and in areas where we didn&rsquo;t like what it did</p>
<p>and Microsoft didn&rsquo;t agree,</p>
<p>we sometimes got away with slight changes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the story of standards.</p>
<p>You have different implementations</p>
<p>and depending on their market power,</p>
<p>they interoperate where you have agreement</p>
<p>and where they don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>the dominant one usually sets the de facto standard.</p>
<p>And then you should probably reflect that</p>
<p>into the de jure standard.</p>
<p>And this happened with JavaScript.</p>
<p>Over time, as Netscape went down and Microsoft went up,</p>
<p>we did the first edition of the standard codified in 1997</p>
<p>in France, we had a trip to Nice, which was very memorable.</p>
<p>For any interesting reason or just because it&rsquo;s Nice?</p>
<p>And ECMA&rsquo;s European and IBM and others were there.</p>
<p>Mike Kalashaw, an IBM fellow was a British.</p>
<p>And the guy who ran ECMA at the time, Jan van der Bell,</p>
<p>was quite a raconteur and a very fun guy.</p>
<p>And he had us out for, you know, the great,</p>
<p>you know, Fui de mer, the bouillabaisse and the&hellip;</p>
<p>Was the standardization process beautiful or painful</p>
<p>that those early days, you as a designer of the language?</p>
<p>It was painful because it was rushed.</p>
<p>Now, Guy Steele was contributed by Sun.</p>
<p>So even more than Sean,</p>
<p>you had this giant brain Guy Steele helping,</p>
<p>bringing some of that scheme magic.</p>
<p>And he even brought Richard Gabriel for funding.</p>
<p>Richard wrote the fourth clause of the ECMA standard,</p>
<p>which was kind of an intro to what JavaScript&rsquo;s all about.</p>
<p>So we had some really good people</p>
<p>and we didn&rsquo;t fight too much.</p>
<p>There was some tension where I was fixing bugs</p>
<p>and I was late to a meeting and Sean Katzenberger,</p>
<p>Microsoft, was actually mad.</p>
<p>Like, where is he?</p>
<p>We need him.</p>
<p>And when I got there,</p>
<p>I saw that only he saw this sort of off by one bug</p>
<p>in somewhere in the spec.</p>
<p>And then I saw it too.</p>
<p>And I said, there&rsquo;s a fence post bug there.</p>
<p>And then we kind of locked eyes</p>
<p>and we realized we were on the same page.</p>
<p>And we kind of, he wasn&rsquo;t mad anymore.</p>
<p>What were the features that are being struggled over</p>
<p>and debated and thought about?</p>
<p>It was mainly writing down what worked</p>
<p>and what we thought should work in the edge cases</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t interoperate or that seemed wrong.</p>
<p>But we were already laying the groundwork</p>
<p>for the future additions that I was already implementing.</p>
<p>I was still trying to lead the standard</p>
<p>by using the dominant market power</p>
<p>to write the code that actually shipped.</p>
<p>So the de facto standard would lead the de jure standard.</p>
<p>And I was putting in the missing function forms</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t have time for in the 10 days.</p>
<p>So this is the engineering mindset versus the theoretician.</p>
<p>So you didn&rsquo;t want to create the perfect language,</p>
<p>but one that was the popular and shipped</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And you could say there was,</p>
<p>I was standing on the shoulders of giants.</p>
<p>So there was a staged process</p>
<p>where I had to hold back things</p>
<p>that were well designed by others in other languages</p>
<p>and I could imitate,</p>
<p>but I couldn&rsquo;t do them all in the 10 days.</p>
<p>So they came in 1996 and 97,</p>
<p>and they came into the third edition of the standard,</p>
<p>which was final finalized in 1999.</p>
<p>But at that point,</p>
<p>Netscape had been sold to AOL</p>
<p>which was a decent exit considering</p>
<p>and had previously been mercilessly crushed.</p>
<p>Netscape was selling the browser along with server software</p>
<p>that it had acquired after its IPO</p>
<p>and Microsoft was just underpricing it.</p>
<p>So there was no way to compete with that.</p>
<p>Microsoft was also making Internet Explorer</p>
<p>the default browser in Windows,</p>
<p>which is called tying and antitrust law.</p>
<p>And they were doing even more brutal things.</p>
<p>There was a famous investor.</p>
<p>He did very well on Google.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s a billionaire, Ramshree Ram,</p>
<p>and he was sales guy or head of sales at Netscape.</p>
<p>And he got off the phone looking ashen faced</p>
<p>after a compact called and said,</p>
<p>Microsoft just told us they&rsquo;re gonna pull</p>
<p>our Windows license if we ship Netscape</p>
<p>as the default browser.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>So there is some bullying going on.</p>
<p>It was totally immaterial in the antitrust case.</p>
<p>But JavaScript escaped into the standard setting</p>
<p>where there was fairly good cooperation.</p>
<p>Microsoft had a really good guy on it</p>
<p>and Guy Steele was there for a time</p>
<p>and there was some good work.</p>
<p>But after the antitrust case</p>
<p>and Netscape kind of dissolving into AOL</p>
<p>and not really going anywhere quickly,</p>
<p>Mozilla took years to really bring up,</p>
<p>the standard froze.</p>
<p>And by 2003, even though they&rsquo;d been sort of noodling around</p>
<p>with advanced versions, JavaScript 2,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d given the keys to the kingdom</p>
<p>to another MIT grad, Baltimore Horwatt.</p>
<p>Very big brain and still at Google, I think.</p>
<p>He won the Putnam in 86</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s very mathematical.</p>
<p>Legit.</p>
<p>He designed this successor language, JavaScript 2,</p>
<p>but it only showed up in mutated form</p>
<p>in Microsoft&rsquo;s ASP.NET server side</p>
<p>and it didn&rsquo;t last there.</p>
<p>And it showed up in Flash</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what became ActionScript 3.</p>
<p>Ah, ActionScript, interesting.</p>
<p>And then Flash of course declined.</p>
<p>And so how did we arrive at ES6</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s so many,</p>
<p>where everyone, okay, there&rsquo;s this history of JavaScript</p>
<p>that people were, it was just like cool</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re like having beers to talk crap about JavaScript.</p>
<p>Everyone loves to hate,</p>
<p>like people who are married say, ah, marriage sucks,</p>
<p>is they just wanna get, let off some steam</p>
<p>even though everyone uses the language.</p>
<p>But ES6, it&rsquo;s become this like reputable,</p>
<p>like it fixed major pain points, I think.</p>
<p>It added things to the language</p>
<p>and added something that was already ES5 strict mode,</p>
<p>but made it implicit in class bodies and module bodies.</p>
<p>It was a big jump,</p>
<p>but it accumulated some of the ES4 designs</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;d done with Adobe</p>
<p>for what we hoped would be the fourth edition of ECMAScript</p>
<p>that were supposed to fold in some of these old JavaScript 2</p>
<p>ideas that had come into ActionScript 3.</p>
<p>So you look at the family tree and you see these forks</p>
<p>and the main ones are the ones that go into Adobe Flash</p>
<p>acquired from Macromedia</p>
<p>and the one that went into the service side</p>
<p>of Microsoft&rsquo;s stack, which kind of died.</p>
<p>And then trying to bring them back into the standard</p>
<p>and not quite succeeding, ES4 was mothballed,</p>
<p>but all the good parts that everyone liked made it into ES6.</p>
<p>And so that was a success.</p>
<p>And I said earlier, I had the wrong year,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s 2015, so it&rsquo;s off by.</p>
<p>Four, ES6.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was finalized in 2015.</p>
<p>It took a little longer than we hoped,</p>
<p>but because ES5 was 2009</p>
<p>and that was a smaller increment from ES3.</p>
<p>We skipped four again, we mothballed it.</p>
<p>And we had a split in the committee where some people said,</p>
<p>ES4 is too big, we&rsquo;re gonna work on incremental improvements,</p>
<p>no new syntax in particular, they promised.</p>
<p>Not quite true, but they added a bunch of interesting APIs,</p>
<p>Alan Wiersbrock, my coauthor of the Hobble paper.</p>
<p>And he was at Microsoft at the time.</p>
<p>I ended up hiring with Mozilla.</p>
<p>He wanted to get to Mozilla and keep doing</p>
<p>his sort of editor job of the JavaScript standard,</p>
<p>ECMAScript.</p>
<p>And when we got ES6 done, it was a little late, 2015,</p>
<p>and we switched to year numbers.</p>
<p>So people still call it ES6, I call it ES6.</p>
<p>But if you remember, off by nine plus 2000.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, ES6 is such a big job.</p>
<p>I mean, like you said, there&rsquo;s a third that connects all of it,</p>
<p>but ES6 is when it became this language</p>
<p>that almost feels ready to take over the world completely.</p>
<p>More programming and the large features,</p>
<p>more features you need for larger teams.</p>
<p>Software engineering.</p>
<p>Microsoft did something smart, too.</p>
<p>Anders and company, Luke Hoban, who&rsquo;s left Microsoft,</p>
<p>also did TypeScript.</p>
<p>And they realized something, I think,</p>
<p>that Gilad Barak has also popularized,</p>
<p>and he was involved in Dart at Google.</p>
<p>If you, don&rsquo;t worry about soundness in the type system.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t try to enforce the type checks</p>
<p>at runtime in particular.</p>
<p>Just use it as sort of a warning system,</p>
<p>a tool time type system.</p>
<p>You can still have a lot of value for developers,</p>
<p>especially in large projects.</p>
<p>So TypeScript&rsquo;s been a roaring success for Microsoft.</p>
<p>What do you think about TypeScript?</p>
<p>Is it adding confusion, or is it ultimately beneficial?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s beneficial.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s technically a superset of JavaScript,</p>
<p>so of course I love it, right?</p>
<p>The shortest JavaScript program</p>
<p>is still a TypeScript program.</p>
<p>Any JavaScript program is a TypeScript program,</p>
<p>which is brilliant,</p>
<p>because then you can start incrementally adding</p>
<p>type annotations, getting warnings,</p>
<p>learning how to use them.</p>
<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s had to kind of look around corners</p>
<p>at the standards body and guess how their version of modules</p>
<p>or decorators should work.</p>
<p>And the standards body then may change things a bit.</p>
<p>So I think they&rsquo;re obligated with TypeScript</p>
<p>either to carry their own version</p>
<p>or to bring it back with incompatible changes</p>
<p>towards the standard over time.</p>
<p>And I think they&rsquo;ve played generally fair there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some sentiment that,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t they standardize TypeScript?</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;ve been clear they don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>They have a proprietary investment, it&rsquo;s valuable.</p>
<p>They have control of the ball.</p>
<p>And in some ways, you can say the same thing</p>
<p>to any of the other big companies in the standards body.</p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t Google standardize its stuff?</p>
<p>So you think it&rsquo;ll continue being</p>
<p>like a kind of dance partner to JavaScript,</p>
<p>to the base JavaScript?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a hope that at some point,</p>
<p>if they keep reconverging it and the standard</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t break them and goes in a good direction,</p>
<p>we will get at least the annotation syntax</p>
<p>and some semantics around them.</p>
<p>Because when you&rsquo;re talking about type annotations,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re generally on parameters and return values</p>
<p>and variable declarations.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re cast operators.</p>
<p>You want that syntax to be reserved</p>
<p>and you want it to work the same in all engines.</p>
<p>And this is where ideas like Gilad&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pluggable type systems might be good,</p>
<p>though then you could create the same problem</p>
<p>you have with Lisp and Scheme,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a bunch of macro libraries</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t agree and you have conflicts between them.</p>
<p>But pluggable type systems could be one way to standardize.</p>
<p>What do you think about the giant ecosystem</p>
<p>of frameworks in JavaScript?</p>
<p>It feels like, because, I mean,</p>
<p>this is a side effect of how many people use JavaScript,</p>
<p>a lot of entrepreneurial spirit</p>
<p>create their own JavaScript frameworks</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re actually awesome in all different ways.</p>
<p>And this is an interesting question</p>
<p>about almost like philosophically</p>
<p>about biological system and evolution,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Do you see that as good or should it like,</p>
<p>should some of them die out quicker?</p>
<p>I think maybe they should, now jQuery was a very clever</p>
<p>thing, John Resig made this library</p>
<p>that was sort of query and do</p>
<p>and blended sort of CSS selector syntax</p>
<p>with JavaScript sort of object graph or DOM querying</p>
<p>and made it very easy for people to do things</p>
<p>almost like they were learning jQuery as its own language,</p>
<p>domain specific language.</p>
<p>And that I think reflected in part the difficulty</p>
<p>of using the document object model,</p>
<p>these APIs that were originally designed in the 90s</p>
<p>for Java as well as JavaScript.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very object oriented or even procedural.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very kind of verbose.</p>
<p>And it took like a constructor call</p>
<p>and three different, you know, hokey pokey dances</p>
<p>to do something where as in jQuery, it&rsquo;s just one line.</p>
<p>Right, so that fed back finally into the standards.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t mean we standardized jQuery.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t quite that concise,</p>
<p>but you find now with the modern standards</p>
<p>that we were working on in the HTML5 sort of effort</p>
<p>that things became simpler, the fetch API</p>
<p>and the query selector API, document.querySelector.</p>
<p>A lot of things can be done now in raw JavaScript</p>
<p>that you would make more concise and terse in jQuery,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>Whereas in the old DOM of 15 years ago,</p>
<p>it was just too verbose.</p>
<p>So maybe the frameworks were born kind of</p>
<p>because JavaScript lacks some of the features of jQuery.</p>
<p>And so like now that JavaScript is swallowing</p>
<p>what jQuery was, then the frameworks will,</p>
<p>only the ones that truly add value will stick around</p>
<p>and the other ones will die out.</p>
<p>And that highlights this also this division</p>
<p>between the core language JavaScript,</p>
<p>which can show up in other places</p>
<p>like Node.js on the server side</p>
<p>and the browser specific APIs</p>
<p>or the document object model APIs,</p>
<p>which are even managed by the W3C,</p>
<p>the standards body that was off in XML La La Land</p>
<p>when we were doing real JavaScript standards in ECMA.</p>
<p>And you have this division of labor,</p>
<p>division of responsibility and division of style</p>
<p>and sort of aesthetics and also speed.</p>
<p>So the document object model really stagnated</p>
<p>after Microsoft kind of deinvested in the web.</p>
<p>And Microsoft did something in their haste</p>
<p>in the spirit of Netscape,</p>
<p>doing things quickly and getting on first called DHTML.</p>
<p>And some of their innovations</p>
<p>that were like an alternative document object model</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t really get standardized until HTML5</p>
<p>when we pragmatists at Opera at the time,</p>
<p>Ian Hickson who went to Google,</p>
<p>Apple and Mozilla said let&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>XML is not gonna replace HTML, HTML4 is too old.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s standardize HTML5 based on all this good stuff</p>
<p>including that DHTML variant dynamic HTML5.</p>
<p>HTML5, it feels like to me, maybe you can correct me,</p>
<p>like a beautiful piece of design work.</p>
<p>It was, it&rsquo;s not often with web stuff,</p>
<p>you have this breath of just like,</p>
<p>oh, whoever did this is, it just feels good.</p>
<p>Is that, what are your thoughts about HTML?</p>
<p>Is the, am I being too romantic?</p>
<p>A little bit, a little bit.</p>
<p>Are there flaws, fundamental flaws to it</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m just not aware of?</p>
<p>My old friend Hixie did a great job.</p>
<p>He was another renegade physics student.</p>
<p>And he was basically a QA guy at Opera</p>
<p>but he obviously trained physics student</p>
<p>and someone who could write British</p>
<p>or he developed test suites</p>
<p>and he started thinking about them more axiomatically.</p>
<p>Now this is, this can be good</p>
<p>because you can sort of systematize</p>
<p>in a way that makes a better HTML</p>
<p>or you can get caught in the pragmatism of saying,</p>
<p>well, we have to handle all of these edge cases</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re just gonna have sort of a test matrix.</p>
<p>And if the matrix is large,</p>
<p>it will not be beautiful by many people&rsquo;s lights.</p>
<p>Everyone likes to minimize along their preferred dimensions,</p>
<p>the seven special forms and scheme or whatever.</p>
<p>But reality is HTML needs to be big.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of shambolic, it&rsquo;s a creative multi paradigm.</p>
<p>And Hixie did a good job, I would say, with a bunch of it.</p>
<p>Other people came in in the spirit of Ian Hickson</p>
<p>to do HTML5 work and they&rsquo;ve carried on that effort.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a mix of pragmatism,</p>
<p>de facto standards from the past being sort of combined</p>
<p>or written down for the first time</p>
<p>and then rethought in a way that has a simpler syntax,</p>
<p>like the fetch API instead of XML HTTP request.</p>
<p>This video too as well, it ultimately,</p>
<p>it feels like maybe you can correct me,</p>
<p>it feels like it was the nail in the coffin of Flash.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs saying no Flash on the iPhone,</p>
<p>in my opinion, was the actual sting through the heart.</p>
<p>But, well, I&rsquo;m not sure what trope you wanna use.</p>
<p>Flash was a zombie until just this year, right?</p>
<p>Or last year, I think last year</p>
<p>was the end of Flash in main browsers.</p>
<p>But Jobs really did the death blow.</p>
<p>And yeah, you&rsquo;re right, we had to make HTML5 competitive.</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t think we got</p>
<p>that beautiful timeline animation.</p>
<p>The timeline thing, so you like the time.</p>
<p>I mean, me from, I used to animate</p>
<p>all kinds of stuff inside Flash,</p>
<p>plus there&rsquo;s a programming element.</p>
<p>It was a little bit, I don&rsquo;t know if you can comment on that,</p>
<p>but to me, it was a little bit like go to statement,</p>
<p>like in a sense that it was a little bit too chaotic.</p>
<p>Like it didn&rsquo;t, that OCD part of me as a programmer</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t satisfied by Flash.</p>
<p>It feels like there was bugs that were introduced</p>
<p>through the animation process that I couldn&rsquo;t debug easily.</p>
<p>Yes, I heard that too.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t use it,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m doing the grass is greener thing here.</p>
<p>The thing I liked about the animation model</p>
<p>was that it was this immutable function of time.</p>
<p>So you could time warp and you could,</p>
<p>if you dodged these bugs or worked carefully,</p>
<p>you could really make it sing in ways</p>
<p>that I think still a little challenging</p>
<p>with the web animation standards.</p>
<p>But, or just using raw canvas and WebGL.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s so many tools now that maybe it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>And yet we had to do video,</p>
<p>we had to do WebGL and then evolve it.</p>
<p>We had to do web audio.</p>
<p>But once we did all these things that helped Flash die,</p>
<p>thanks to Steve Gubbs,</p>
<p>we had something that people didn&rsquo;t realize.</p>
<p>We had that vision that Market Vision had,</p>
<p>this graphics capable to the metal portable runtime.</p>
<p>And we at Mozilla realized this</p>
<p>and we saw JavaScript was something</p>
<p>that you could compile to.</p>
<p>Adobe had somebody in the Adobe Labs doing this too.</p>
<p>He had a project called Alchemy.</p>
<p>We had somebody who&rsquo;s now Google,</p>
<p>Alon Zakai, who did his own LLVM based compiler</p>
<p>that would take C or C++ and it would emit JavaScript.</p>
<p>And you would think this is crazy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going from this sort of machine types,</p>
<p>low level, controlled memory allocation language</p>
<p>to this garbage collected, dynamically typed,</p>
<p>high level, higher level language.</p>
<p>But Alon sort of just phenomenologically carved nature</p>
<p>of the joint and found the forms</p>
<p>that were fast in JavaScript.</p>
<p>And then with Dave Herman,</p>
<p>who I&rsquo;d recruited from Northeastern University,</p>
<p>who was a type theorist,</p>
<p>and Luke Wagner, who&rsquo;s still at Mozilla,</p>
<p>who was the compiler guy and the JIT guy,</p>
<p>they figured out how to codify what Alon had done</p>
<p>into a typed subset of JavaScript called Asm.js.</p>
<p>And this is a strange thing to think about</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t have new syntax.</p>
<p>The types are casts that occur in dominator positions</p>
<p>in the control flow graph.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like a hack on JavaScript and it&rsquo;s a subset</p>
<p>and it uses those bitwise operators</p>
<p>that I talked about copying from Java</p>
<p>to basically cast numeric types,</p>
<p>which are double position flowing point, into integers.</p>
<p>And so inside JavaScript, in the kernel semantics,</p>
<p>are integers.</p>
<p>And if you use these operators,</p>
<p>if a compiler emits them in the right places,</p>
<p>you can then treat them as typed values,</p>
<p>typed memory locations, and you can type check your program.</p>
<p>You can not only type check it, you can compile it.</p>
<p>And this is all in sort of linear time, Alon.</p>
<p>You can compile it to have deterministic performance.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t touch the garbage collector.</p>
<p>It calls a bunch of functions that come from the C functions</p>
<p>or C++ code that you&rsquo;re compiling.</p>
<p>And you can make the Epic Unreal Engine</p>
<p>go in 30 frames a second.</p>
<p>And when we did this in 2013 in the fall,</p>
<p>Tim Sweeney and I didn&rsquo;t think it could be done quickly.</p>
<p>Thought it would take years.</p>
<p>And the team went to Raleigh, to Epic,</p>
<p>and in four days they had Unreal Engine ported</p>
<p>by pressing a compile button.</p>
<p>But they had to have WebGL,</p>
<p>which came from OpenGL.</p>
<p>Yes, it came to OpenGL, which came from Silicon Graphics GL.</p>
<p>They had to have Web Audio so they could map OpenAL,</p>
<p>which was another audio library standard to Web Audio,</p>
<p>which was kind of a Chrome idiosyncratic thing.</p>
<p>But they could make it work.</p>
<p>And they had to have Asm.js for fast C++ to JavaScript.</p>
<p>And if you didn&rsquo;t have that fast compiler step,</p>
<p>the JavaScript you&rsquo;d write by hand</p>
<p>trying to do an Unreal game would be too big and too slow.</p>
<p>It would touch the garbage collector.</p>
<p>It would not keep up with 30 frames a second</p>
<p>on the hardware, 2013 hardware.</p>
<p>So we demoed that at,</p>
<p>this must have been fall 2012 now that I think about it.</p>
<p>Because we demoed it at GDC,</p>
<p>Game Developer Conference 2013.</p>
<p>And people were stunned.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like Unreal Engine, Unreal Tournament</p>
<p>running in my browser window.</p>
<p>No plugin, no Flash, no Java, no.</p>
<p>So were those the early days of,</p>
<p>because JavaScript now is able to run basically on par</p>
<p>with a lot of the C++.</p>
<p>And even before then,</p>
<p>you had the fast JavaScript VMs in 2008</p>
<p>when Chrome came out.</p>
<p>Just before it came out, Mozilla,</p>
<p>my friend Andreas Gal and I and others</p>
<p>hacked out Trace Monkey, our Trace based JIT.</p>
<p>The Squirrel Fish Extreme team at Apple did their JIT.</p>
<p>And we were all competing</p>
<p>on these crazy performance benchmarks.</p>
<p>It was a little bit too much tuning to the benchmark.</p>
<p>But JavaScript started getting fast</p>
<p>and developers started noticing it.</p>
<p>But it was still kind of its own high level language</p>
<p>with garbage collection.</p>
<p>The Asm.js step helped us go further</p>
<p>because until we really proved the concept,</p>
<p>people were still saying, well, JavaScript&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting faster, thanks to V8.</p>
<p>Everybody gave Google credit, especially Google.</p>
<p>But we need something to kill Flash.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s use the portable native client code</p>
<p>that Google had acquired, native client.</p>
<p>Which is a separate lineage for taking basically C code,</p>
<p>compiling it into a software fault isolated container</p>
<p>of some sort using some kind of virtualization technique.</p>
<p>And maybe it can even be in process</p>
<p>and still be memory safe, that would be awesome.</p>
<p>But they ended up using process isolation too.</p>
<p>And that kind of weakened it.</p>
<p>And in the end, it was like portable native client,</p>
<p>okay, meet the new boss, same as the old boss.</p>
<p>This is the Google Flash, right?</p>
<p>But when we did Asm.js and we showed Unreal Engine working,</p>
<p>I think it was only a matter of time</p>
<p>before Google threw in the towel.</p>
<p>And in fact, everybody agreed in spring of 2015,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna take what was proven by Asm.js</p>
<p>and make a new syntax, a binary syntax, it&rsquo;s efficient,</p>
<p>that loads into the same JavaScript VM</p>
<p>that JavaScript loads into.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;ll be two source languages, one VM,</p>
<p>very important, one garbage collector,</p>
<p>one memory manager, one set of compiler stages.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s called WebAssembly.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the successor to Asm.js.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s important that it have binary syntax</p>
<p>because at the end of the day, especially on mobile,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re downloading JavaScript,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re using LZ compression on the wire,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s cool, but you&rsquo;ve got to blow it out into memory</p>
<p>and then parse the silly eight character function keyword</p>
<p>that I picked, when I should have used something shorter,</p>
<p>I picked it because of awk, the Unix tool.</p>
<p>So anyways.</p>
<p>I want to, but I&rsquo;m not following the awk thread.</p>
<p>Yeah, don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>Is it surprising to you that,</p>
<p>how damn fast JavaScript is these days?</p>
<p>I mean, like, you&rsquo;ve been through the whole journey.</p>
<p>I know every step of the way, but is it like,</p>
<p>I mean, it feels incredible.</p>
<p>It does, but I knew, so the funny thing is,</p>
<p>computer science is this big karmic wheel, right?</p>
<p>Wheel of Fortuna.</p>
<p>And in the, it&rsquo;s about the 97,</p>
<p>I was loaned by Netscape to do due diligence for Sun</p>
<p>in their acquisition of Anamorphic,</p>
<p>which was David Unger and friends, people,</p>
<p>Craig, I&rsquo;m forgetting his name, he went to Microsoft.</p>
<p>These Stanford language buffs who&rsquo;d taken Smalltalk</p>
<p>and then David create itself</p>
<p>as a simpler sort of Smalltalk language</p>
<p>and made really fast, just in time compiling VMs for them.</p>
<p>And they, you know, well ahead of Java hotspot</p>
<p>or JavaScript V8 or any of these modern VMs,</p>
<p>figured out how to make dynamic code fast</p>
<p>because Smalltalk is dynamic language, right?</p>
<p>It has classes, it has, I think more lockdown declarative</p>
<p>syntax than JavaScript, but it&rsquo;s fundamentally dynamic.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t declare the types.</p>
<p>But you could infer the types as the program runs</p>
<p>and you start to form these ideas</p>
<p>about what types are actually flowing through key operations</p>
<p>and you form little so called polymorphic inline caches</p>
<p>that are optimized machine code.</p>
<p>The cache is the machine code that assumes,</p>
<p>does a quick check to make sure the type is right</p>
<p>and if it&rsquo;s not right, it bails to the interpreter.</p>
<p>And if it is right, you go pretty fast.</p>
<p>And that short test is a predicted branch,</p>
<p>so things are pretty quick.</p>
<p>All that amazing stuff I knew about in the 90s</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t have time to do it</p>
<p>and Anamorphic got bought by Sun and they did hotspot.</p>
<p>And you needed that even in Java because at scale,</p>
<p>Java has some dynamic aspects due to invoke interface.</p>
<p>You can have basically collections of Java code</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t know at the time each module</p>
<p>or package is compiled exactly what&rsquo;s being called,</p>
<p>what subclass or what implementation</p>
<p>of an interface is being called.</p>
<p>And so you want to optimize using this sort of dynamic</p>
<p>polymorphic caching there too.</p>
<p>And they did that and hotspot, it&rsquo;s amazing beast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve met like 13 people who all claim they created it.</p>
<p>I think one of them may deserve credit more than others.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t get to do that in JavaScript.</p>
<p>And when we knew that Google was going to do their own</p>
<p>browser, which we knew at Mozilla around 2006,</p>
<p>I also met the team that did V8.</p>
<p>And it turns out it was Lars Bach,</p>
<p>who was one of the young engineers from Anamorphic</p>
<p>that got acquired by Sun.</p>
<p>And so Lars is like one of the world&rsquo;s expert</p>
<p>on these kinds of virtual machines.</p>
<p>And he picked my brains about JavaScript.</p>
<p>I could tell he didn&rsquo;t like it at the time,</p>
<p>but he had to do it.</p>
<p>And&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, really interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, in 2006 lunch at Google&rsquo;s campus.</p>
<p>And then I had another friend who was DevRel at Chrome</p>
<p>and he said, yeah, we don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>This is getting 2007 to fall, getting toward 2008.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to get Chrome out</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going with the V8 team.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re off in Aarhus, Denmark,</p>
<p>rewriting their engine four times, which is good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the right way to do this kind of development.</p>
<p>They were learning JavaScript, including all its quirks,</p>
<p>which they came to hate the fire of a thousand suns,</p>
<p>which is one of the reasons that Lars and company did Dart,</p>
<p>their own language.</p>
<p>But they also made the language fast.</p>
<p>And meanwhile, we knew this was happening.</p>
<p>So we got our act together with Trace Monkey,</p>
<p>our tracing JIT at Mozilla and Apple I think was also aware.</p>
<p>And so they were doing their own JIT.</p>
<p>So the era of JITed fast JavaScript in 2008</p>
<p>had this prehistory going back to Smalltalk itself</p>
<p>and Anamorphic.</p>
<p>And again, the lineage is interesting</p>
<p>because you had Lars and Anamorphic</p>
<p>and then he ends up at Google.</p>
<p>Yeah, and today we have an incredibly fast language</p>
<p>that like you said, still,</p>
<p>without hate, you can&rsquo;t have love.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s both love and hate for this dance,</p>
<p>this rich complex dance of JavaScript</p>
<p>throughout its history.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a dialectic for sure.</p>
<p>Today, JavaScript is the most popular language in the world.</p>
<p>Why by many measures?</p>
<p>Why do you think that is?</p>
<p>Is there some fundamental ideas</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve already spoke to a little bit</p>
<p>but sort of broader</p>
<p>that you think is the most popular language in the world?</p>
<p>So I think I did, by doing first class functions</p>
<p>and taking the good parts of the C operator hierarchy</p>
<p>and just keeping things simple enough,</p>
<p>maybe it could have been simpler</p>
<p>but I had to make it look like Java</p>
<p>and interoperate with Java</p>
<p>that there was inherent goodness,</p>
<p>Aristotelian quality there.</p>
<p>And people perceive that</p>
<p>even through all the quirks and warts.</p>
<p>And then over time working on it with the standards body,</p>
<p>working on it not only as a core language</p>
<p>but in the context of HTML5 and making the browser better,</p>
<p>listening to developers, thinking about,</p>
<p>this is something that Nick Thompson wrote nicely</p>
<p>about on Hacker News, I was very flattered.</p>
<p>He said, Java was this thing</p>
<p>where the experts were writing the code</p>
<p>and it was compiled and you had to declare all your types</p>
<p>and Sun didn&rsquo;t really give a damn about</p>
<p>the average programmer who wanted to build real web apps,</p>
<p>dynamic things.</p>
<p>And I was in there meanwhile doing a bunch of people&rsquo;s jobs</p>
<p>making JavaScript survive those early years</p>
<p>when it was kind of touch and go.</p>
<p>JavaScript was considered a Mickey Mouse language.</p>
<p>It was for annoyances like the scrolling text</p>
<p>at the bottom of the browser in the status bar.</p>
<p>But I kept listening to developers working with them</p>
<p>and trying to make it run in that single threaded event loop</p>
<p>in a useful way.</p>
<p>And I think that forged something</p>
<p>that people have come to love.</p>
<p>Now you don&rsquo;t always love the best thing, right?</p>
<p>I talked about Shakespeare sonnet about</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Mr. Sizer, nothing like the sun.</p>
<p>Or the scene from Josh Whedon&rsquo;s film Serenity at the end</p>
<p>where the actual piece in the score by David Newman</p>
<p>is called Love where Captain Mal is teaching River Tam</p>
<p>about how to pilot the ship.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s a super genius, super soldier.</p>
<p>She knows how to do it already.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s basically talking about how you have to love</p>
<p>the ship because if you don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s going to kill you.</p>
<p>And then the piece falls off the ship.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like JavaScript.</p>
<p>You have to love it.</p>
<p>You have to love it because now people say we&rsquo;re stuck</p>
<p>with it because it got this priority of place.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s love underpinning that.</p>
<p>And actually the listening to developers,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of beautiful.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s most successful products in this world</p>
<p>with all the messes, with all the flaws.</p>
<p>Perhaps the flaws themselves are actual features,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a whole nother, that&rsquo;s a discussion about love.</p>
<p>But underneath it, there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that just connects with people.</p>
<p>And it has to keep connecting.</p>
<p>If JavaScript kind of went off in this,</p>
<p>people sometimes complain about ES6.</p>
<p>Oh, you put classes in JavaScript.</p>
<p>I hate classes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve ruined it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dynamic language.</p>
<p>Smalltalk had classes.</p>
<p>Python has classes.</p>
<p>There are lots of Lisp variants that have classy systems.</p>
<p>So people who don&rsquo;t reject it based on some sort</p>
<p>of fashion judgment do use it and do interact</p>
<p>with the standards body.</p>
<p>The standards body is competing browser vendors mainly,</p>
<p>but also now big companies that use JavaScript heavily,</p>
<p>the Paypal&rsquo;s and other such companies, Salesforce.</p>
<p>And they have to cater to web developers.</p>
<p>They have to hire developers who know JavaScript.</p>
<p>They have to keep their engines up to the latest standard.</p>
<p>And this creates all this sort of social structure</p>
<p>around JavaScript that is unusual.</p>
<p>I mean, you get C++ buffs that follow the inner workings</p>
<p>of C++, what is it now?</p>
<p>21 something, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lost track.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a more rarefied group.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like the old language, gray hairs.</p>
<p>Whereas JavaScript is a younger</p>
<p>and more vibrant and large crowd.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a community feel to it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s echoes, perhaps I don&rsquo;t wanna draw too many</p>
<p>similarities, maybe you can comment on it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s C++ is like Wall Street,</p>
<p>and the JavaScript is like Wall Street bets</p>
<p>from the recent events.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a chaotic community of all,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some power from that distributed crowd</p>
<p>of people that ultimately.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more thematic, it&rsquo;s more of the people.</p>
<p>It lets people in without requiring these credentials.</p>
<p>I remember in the late 90s into the 90s,</p>
<p>people were all getting Java credentials.</p>
<p>And I knew people, and friends knew people</p>
<p>who became Java programmers, and you knew</p>
<p>they really should have been like nature guides or pilots.</p>
<p>They hated programming, but they thought,</p>
<p>I gotta make money, I&rsquo;m gonna become a Java programmer.</p>
<p>Do you have some, because it&rsquo;s such a monumental moment</p>
<p>in our current history, as a quick aside,</p>
<p>do you have thoughts about this huge distributed crowdsourced</p>
<p>financial happenings with Wall Street bets?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like nobody could have, well,</p>
<p>you could have predicted, but the scale and the impact</p>
<p>of this kind of emergent behavior</p>
<p>from independent parties that could happen.</p>
<p>Like I said, my own experience with the dismal science,</p>
<p>as with physics, led me to reject a lot of bad models.</p>
<p>Economics was always compromised by politics,</p>
<p>political economy.</p>
<p>You could also argue that it was,</p>
<p>it used to be a branch of moral philosophy,</p>
<p>so it was concerned with the good,</p>
<p>and it became divorced and became sort of</p>
<p>in this quasi Newtonian way, just about,</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s just running by itself, don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>This monopoly&rsquo;s crushing your Netscape company,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s just nature.</p>
<p>And economics couldn&rsquo;t, or doesn&rsquo;t really have good models</p>
<p>for the Wall Street bets subreddit.</p>
<p>You know, they know how to squeeze a short, right?</p>
<p>So the amazing thing is you have Robinhood app,</p>
<p>which was, again, supposedly for the demos, for the people,</p>
<p>and eliminated the fee through various kinds of straddles</p>
<p>or some kind of spread operation</p>
<p>that helped them eliminate the fee or eat the fee.</p>
<p>And in fact, as a broker in these days,</p>
<p>because it takes two days to settle,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s counterparty risk, as they found out.</p>
<p>And so the Wall Street bets people,</p>
<p>you know, the memes are like the Terminator robot</p>
<p>with the $600 STEMI check and the hedge funds</p>
<p>that make little girl hiding under the desk.</p>
<p>There is a problem, which I talked about</p>
<p>in a recent podcast, which I&rsquo;m conscious of</p>
<p>from the history of the web, and that is,</p>
<p>you could say it&rsquo;s monopoly,</p>
<p>which antitrust wasn&rsquo;t enforced</p>
<p>after USB Microsoft for a long time.</p>
<p>And a lot of this was due to the money interests</p>
<p>buying control of politicians.</p>
<p>And, you know, in Plato&rsquo;s five regimes, that&rsquo;s oligarchy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where we are.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re seeing a fight against the oligarchs.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;ll work,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re definitely seeing it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also kind of hackerish, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a hacker ethos.</p>
<p>You know, hey, Robinhood, no fees.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>Hey, you know, I could buy a fraction of a share</p>
<p>in this thing, or I can keep buying with my stimulus check.</p>
<p>So I mentioned Hegel seeing Napoleon on the horse, right?</p>
<p>Hegel also talked about the cunning of reason</p>
<p>that you have this sort of, you know,</p>
<p>God sees history in full, and if you believe in God,</p>
<p>or, you know, we don&rsquo;t know the future,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s always this sort of fly in the ointment,</p>
<p>this unintended consequence that confounds</p>
<p>the best plans of the powers that be.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re living through it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s not, you know, street warfare</p>
<p>or mechanized warfare, because it has been in the past.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like soft power, and people are fighting back.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible?</p>
<p>So JavaScript used to be for the front end of the web.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now increasingly so being used for back end,</p>
<p>like running stuff that&rsquo;s like behind the scenes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also starting to be used quite a bit</p>
<p>for things like TensorFlow.js.</p>
<p>So starting to actually use like these heavy duty</p>
<p>applications that are using neural networks,</p>
<p>machine learning, and so on in the browser.</p>
<p>Is it possible in 10, 20, 30 years</p>
<p>that basically most of the world runs on JavaScript?</p>
<p>This is a dystopia and a nightmare to some people.</p>
<p>When we did Asm.js and WebAssembly,</p>
<p>I would joke and mean people with scenes like</p>
<p>Neo waking up in his pod in the matrix,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s all skinny and weak and hairless.</p>
<p>And, you know, you realize in the future</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re living in some simulation</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s all running on JavaScript,</p>
<p>and you just scream forever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Gary Bernhardt does these funny talks.</p>
<p>He did watch.js, and then he did this</p>
<p>life and death of JavaScript, I think it&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>where he took some clever ideas that actually have</p>
<p>a thread of credibility to them.</p>
<p>But I mentioned software fault isolation.</p>
<p>In the old days, when we were using computers,</p>
<p>we said we&rsquo;re gonna use the Unix monolithic monitor,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the privileged program.</p>
<p>This is before you even had hardware rings of protection.</p>
<p>Those, some of the early 60s operating systems</p>
<p>used hardware protection zones.</p>
<p>But Unix is privileged, and the program</p>
<p>that runs user code in a process is hosted.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the guest, in the host, and you get to suspend it.</p>
<p>You get to kill it.</p>
<p>If it crashes, it doesn&rsquo;t take down the whole OS.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wonderful idea, but the call into the kernel</p>
<p>is expensive, the system call, so called.</p>
<p>And this has even been optimized now</p>
<p>for things like getting the time of day,</p>
<p>so it doesn&rsquo;t actually enter the kernel.</p>
<p>And meanwhile, hardware architectures</p>
<p>and virtualization techniques have gone</p>
<p>in a different direction, even to the point</p>
<p>where you can do software fault isolation very cheaply</p>
<p>without entering the operating system kernel,</p>
<p>and so you get unikernels and exokernels</p>
<p>and very lightweight VMs.</p>
<p>And so Gary took this idea and said, JavaScript</p>
<p>will take over computing, because the system call</p>
<p>boundary&rsquo;s too expensive, so everything ends up</p>
<p>in JavaScript with these lighter weight</p>
<p>isolation enforcement mechanisms.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not totally beyond belief.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be WebAssembly too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to ask you sort of for advice to,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many people that are interested</p>
<p>in starting to learning about programming,</p>
<p>getting into this world.</p>
<p>Is there some number of languages,</p>
<p>three to five programming languages</p>
<p>that you would recommend people learn,</p>
<p>or maybe a broader advice on how</p>
<p>to get started in programming?</p>
<p>Well, so you asked about machine learning,</p>
<p>and JavaScript is a general purpose language,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a language that&rsquo;s not that great</p>
<p>for doing matrix operations or doing parallel programming,</p>
<p>I would say, without using some extensions</p>
<p>or some libraries that have some magic in them.</p>
<p>So if someone wanted to learn,</p>
<p>there are amazing languages in sort of the APL family</p>
<p>that are very useful for, I would say, linear algebra,</p>
<p>which gets to a lot of the kernels in machine learning.</p>
<p>And so APL had like J and then K and their K variants</p>
<p>because the guy that did K is still going,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re proprietary, but he&rsquo;s still innovating there.</p>
<p>There are, you know, Python is used.</p>
<p>So people talk about TensorFlow.js.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not that surprising</p>
<p>because Python was heavily used for machine learning,</p>
<p>and Python was always, you know,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t have this fast just in time compiler tradition.</p>
<p>There were some projects that tried this,</p>
<p>and some of them were interesting.</p>
<p>PyPy was interesting,</p>
<p>but the philosophy with Python was,</p>
<p>oh, you need to go fast, write a C plugin,</p>
<p>and drop into C code.</p>
<p>So I think people should look at multiple languages</p>
<p>because there are different tools in the belt.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to do supervision or rapid prototyping,</p>
<p>you want a dynamic language.</p>
<p>You want to throw things together and see what works.</p>
<p>If you are trying to go down to the metal very fast,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m an old C hacker,</p>
<p>but I was also the executive sponsor of Rust at Mozilla,</p>
<p>and Rust has now escaped, you know,</p>
<p>from that sort of nest where it was born</p>
<p>to be adopted by a bunch of companies</p>
<p>that have a foundation in the works.</p>
<p>Some of the key core team members</p>
<p>are working now at Amazon and other places.</p>
<p>So it looks like Rust has reached escape velocity,</p>
<p>and Rust is an interesting language</p>
<p>because one of our goals there,</p>
<p>one of the reasons I sponsored it was we were all tired</p>
<p>of seeing those remote code execution vulnerabilities</p>
<p>due to C and C++, and we thought,</p>
<p>can we have a sort of safety property</p>
<p>through a type and effect system or an ownership system,</p>
<p>and Rust has that.</p>
<p>And that ownership system is interesting</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t just give you memory safety.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sort of theorem for free,</p>
<p>a dual that falls out for protection against data races.</p>
<p>So Rust is better for low level programming.</p>
<p>You delimit your unsafe code</p>
<p>where you do have to be unsafe,</p>
<p>and you can prove certain facts about memory safety</p>
<p>and race condition avoidance.</p>
<p>And so I think people should learn these new languages.</p>
<p>I think Go is a great language.</p>
<p>I admire, you know, the Unix people who did that.</p>
<p>Ken Stoll was involved, Rob Pike, of course, David,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s his name, and other people.</p>
<p>Go is a huge success, really on the server side,</p>
<p>anywhere you have a lot of networking to do,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s garbage collected, but it&rsquo;s also very pragmatic.</p>
<p>It has that sort of C flavor.</p>
<p>As an old C hacker, I can&rsquo;t get used to the fact</p>
<p>that they swapped the type and declarator</p>
<p>in the declaration order.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t used Rust, but this is one of the most respected</p>
<p>and loved languages currently, so it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s still young.</p>
<p>You look at these things, JavaScript is now considered old.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gone through so many versions</p>
<p>that you can fall in love with it all over again.</p>
<p>25 plus years, you know, it&rsquo;s an adult.</p>
<p>It should be out of the house.</p>
<p>But it could be around another 25 years.</p>
<p>Cannot rule it out.</p>
<p>So Rust will be around for a long time.</p>
<p>The longer you&rsquo;re around, the more likely you&rsquo;re Lindy,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re around your wife.</p>
<p>A lot of people ask me, like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m often torn between recommending either Python</p>
<p>or JavaScript as the first language to play with,</p>
<p>because, I mean, it&rsquo;s difficult,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so easy to do JavaScript incorrectly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much easier to do it correctly these days,</p>
<p>or like, well, learn about programming.</p>
<p>But the cool thing about JavaScript</p>
<p>is that you can create stuff</p>
<p>that will put a smile on your face.</p>
<p>Like, as a developer, you can create stuff,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll visually look like something,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll do stuff, and it makes you feel good.</p>
<p>It makes you fall in love with programming.</p>
<p>With Python, you could do the same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little slower.</p>
<p>And with C++, it takes five to 10 years</p>
<p>to write a program that actually does something.</p>
<p>So, like, there&rsquo;s that tension between</p>
<p>is JavaScript the right first step, or is it Python?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been going back and forth on those two.</p>
<p>My Python, right, it came from a lineage of ABC,</p>
<p>which was a pedagogical language in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>And it, you know,</p>
<p>it was a good teaching language, too.</p>
<p>I think it is a good teaching language,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a little more restrictive</p>
<p>in that if you misspell something</p>
<p>in a way that JavaScript might let run,</p>
<p>let reach runtime, it&rsquo;ll get stopped</p>
<p>at syntax check in Python.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good for beginners.</p>
<p>I think the sloppiness that some people object to,</p>
<p>like, people were just tweeting at me,</p>
<p>having just learned JavaScript.</p>
<p>They said, I can take a number, and I can index into it,</p>
<p>and get undefined out of it as a property.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>A number&rsquo;s not an object.</p>
<p>And I explained why it is,</p>
<p>because like in Java, the primitive types,</p>
<p>which unfortunately are not objects,</p>
<p>can be automatically boxed or wrapped by an object.</p>
<p>And I made that implicit.</p>
<p>In Java, it&rsquo;s typed, and you have to declare things,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get type errors.</p>
<p>But there are cases in Java where you get auto boxing</p>
<p>or auto wrapping, because you&rsquo;ve declared that you want it.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, it just happens.</p>
<p>And so once I explained it, like, oh, wow, I get it.</p>
<p>But it also means that you can commit a blunder that just.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get punished for it, you don&rsquo;t detect.</p>
<p>You get an undefined value,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t know where it came from.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot about military history recently.</p>
<p>And one way to paint the picture of browsers,</p>
<p>internet browsers, is through the various wars</p>
<p>throughout its history.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s a useful way to look at it,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve already talked a little bit about Netscape</p>
<p>and Internet Explorer in the early days.</p>
<p>Can you tell the story of the different wars,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s at all an interesting way to look at it,</p>
<p>of the 90s and to today?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I mentioned that Microsoft, you know,</p>
<p>which was convicted for it, did abuse its monopoly,</p>
<p>but they had a pretty good team by the time they did IE4.</p>
<p>And Netscape, unfortunately, I was like second floor,</p>
<p>and I was friends with all the first floor people,</p>
<p>the front end guys who did the JavaScript event hookup</p>
<p>and things like that,</p>
<p>that that team was fairly burnt out.</p>
<p>And I think having gone public,</p>
<p>the upper management wanted to buy a bunch of companies</p>
<p>to try to go head to head with Microsoft.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t work, but buying a bunch of companies</p>
<p>usually doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>I think the modern sort of approach roughly</p>
<p>is like Mark Zuckerberg took,</p>
<p>which is to keep them at arm&rsquo;s length</p>
<p>and let them do their thing.</p>
<p>And now that he&rsquo;s pulling WhatsApp in</p>
<p>and people are fleeing it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s tied into the ad surveillance.</p>
<p>But, you know, for a while,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re keeping it separate really does work</p>
<p>because you bought it for its value,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s complimentary, and you&rsquo;re not messing with it.</p>
<p>With Netscape, when they bought a bunch of companies,</p>
<p>they had some of the first floor people</p>
<p>or the founders burned out.</p>
<p>They had newcomers who wanted their turn to do the browser,</p>
<p>and they hadn&rsquo;t really done browsers or understood them.</p>
<p>And so Netscape 4 was originally supposed to be 3,</p>
<p>and it was so late, they renumbered it.</p>
<p>We did a 3 release.</p>
<p>Jamie and a few others put some extra effort into.</p>
<p>SecureMine was supported in the built in mail program.</p>
<p>And Netscape 4 was late,</p>
<p>and it was only on Windows at first,</p>
<p>and Microsoft had really started doing better,</p>
<p>like they do.</p>
<p>They copy, and the first version&rsquo;s trash,</p>
<p>and the second one, you&rsquo;re starting to feel threatened.</p>
<p>The third one, you can tell what&rsquo;s gonna happen,</p>
<p>and the fourth one&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>And plus there&rsquo;s the benefit, like you said,</p>
<p>that it comes as a default browser.</p>
<p>Yes, and yet Netscape&rsquo;s screwing it up,</p>
<p>and Microsoft really putting some quality people on it.</p>
<p>IE4 was good.</p>
<p>On Windows, it was good.</p>
<p>And they did the dynamic HTML innovations.</p>
<p>Scott Isaac&rsquo;s my old buddy,</p>
<p>a former accountant who programmed in BASIC</p>
<p>and became what Microsoft calls a program manager,</p>
<p>which is kind of an elevated position.</p>
<p>You can be a programmer or an engineer and track,</p>
<p>but you switch to it,</p>
<p>and you sort of lead a lot of design and standards efforts.</p>
<p>And so Scott Isaac put in a lot of those funky DHTML APIs</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t quite have the same flavor</p>
<p>as the stuff that I did, and neither of them</p>
<p>was like the later sort of verbose Java,</p>
<p>like DOM W3C standardized.</p>
<p>But IE4 was pretty darn good.</p>
<p>I remember a friend, Scott Furman and I,</p>
<p>got invited by Scott Isaac to Gordon Beers in San Jose.</p>
<p>They were doing a preview of IE4.</p>
<p>This must have been 1997.</p>
<p>And Scott said, yeah, here&rsquo;s the new graphics stuff</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got something like your Netscape layers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got VML, a vector markup language.</p>
<p>We can do virtual reality.</p>
<p>And Scott and I looked at each other and said,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doomed, right?</p>
<p>Microsoft was starting to fire on all cylinders.</p>
<p>So I have to give them credit for that,</p>
<p>even though they abused their market power.</p>
<p>And maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t give them credit</p>
<p>for having the resources to hire talented people,</p>
<p>but they did a credible job on IE4.</p>
<p>What really was bad was that phase of the browser wars</p>
<p>ended with monopoly and perhaps due to the antitrust case,</p>
<p>perhaps due to regulation in Europe,</p>
<p>perhaps just due to Microsoft not liking</p>
<p>dealing with standardization, they let it rot.</p>
<p>They just abandoned it, IE5, 5.5, IE6 later,</p>
<p>but these were not well maintained.</p>
<p>They had a lot of security bugs.</p>
<p>It felt really closed and outdated too,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s getting updated, it&rsquo;s just weird.</p>
<p>Browsers like Mozilla and then Firefox were adding tabs.</p>
<p>Opera had a version of tabs and they didn&rsquo;t add tabs.</p>
<p>And they pop up blocking,</p>
<p>something I should have done from the start.</p>
<p>People realized that you can tell</p>
<p>when the user clicks something</p>
<p>and it goes in JavaScript to open a little window,</p>
<p>that you can sort of inspect the stack</p>
<p>and see that the click originated that,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s probably okay.</p>
<p>Whereas if you&rsquo;re just loading a script</p>
<p>and it opens a new window, that&rsquo;s a spam technique</p>
<p>and you should block it.</p>
<p>Tabs were a brilliant innovation.</p>
<p>Like you said, Opera had it,</p>
<p>but I remember I fully switched to Firefox the moment.</p>
<p>I remember the moments of first using tabs in Firefox</p>
<p>and not liking it for the first few minutes,</p>
<p>and then like, wait a minute.</p>
<p>You get the groove, yeah.</p>
<p>You get the groove and you understand.</p>
<p>So that timing, what year was this?</p>
<p>Because also as a aspiring web designer,</p>
<p>I use Table, so we didn&rsquo;t mention Layout or CSS much.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a change in the way</p>
<p>the frames were going away.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a change in the way websites looked</p>
<p>and behaved and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>CSS finally, which Microsoft embraced with IA4</p>
<p>and Netscape never really did right.</p>
<p>CSS became a better standard over time</p>
<p>for doing Table Layout that relieved you</p>
<p>of the need to use what are called spacer GIFs,</p>
<p>spacer GIFs, right?</p>
<p>Images, you would throw into space at tables.</p>
<p>The typographic power of the web has gotten better,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still not on the level of PDF</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t do advanced typography,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s gotten really better.</p>
<p>And even then, tables were getting better.</p>
<p>If you were using Firefox, that would have been 2004</p>
<p>because it was called Firebird until earlier that year.</p>
<p>No, yeah, I think it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>2003.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember, it was a Firebird, which had tabs?</p>
<p>We had tabs the whole way.</p>
<p>So it started out as Mozilla slash browser in 2002,</p>
<p>became Phoenix.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a BIOS that has an embedded version of IE</p>
<p>and they said, we&rsquo;re called Phoenix Technologies,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t use Phoenix.</p>
<p>And so we said, okay, we&rsquo;ll call it Firebird.</p>
<p>And then this Australian centered</p>
<p>open source database project started really like</p>
<p>in the true Mad Max style, just screaming at us saying,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t use Firebird.</p>
<p>And I had to sort of be the ambassador and say,</p>
<p>okay, we&rsquo;re gonna rename.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, we don&rsquo;t believe you,</p>
<p>you shouldn&rsquo;t have used it, we hate you.</p>
<p>And then we renamed it to Firefox.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, ah, we love you.</p>
<p>And then I haven&rsquo;t heard of them ever since.</p>
<p>But Firefox was a clever name.</p>
<p>We had to think of something distinctive.</p>
<p>We wanted to keep the fire going.</p>
<p>And it turns out there&rsquo;s a red panda, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the nickname for it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the second set of browser wars.</p>
<p>So how was Firefox born, how was Mozilla born?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a long story there too.</p>
<p>So Netscape got acquired by AOL,</p>
<p>which as I say was a reasonable happy ending</p>
<p>for a lot of people,</p>
<p>because Netscape otherwise was gonna go out of business</p>
<p>because Microsoft was just killing its market.</p>
<p>There was no way to charge for a browser.</p>
<p>Windows came with IE, IE4 was pretty good</p>
<p>and Netscape 4 wasn&rsquo;t that good.</p>
<p>It took a while to get better.</p>
<p>But the Netscape executive said,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s do an open source escape pod.</p>
<p>And like in Star Wars, A New Hope,</p>
<p>the gunner won&rsquo;t shoot it</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no life forms on board, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a threat.</p>
<p>And so we did Mozilla in 1998</p>
<p>and it looked like it was going to initially</p>
<p>just give the world an open source browser.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really hard to get people to work</p>
<p>on this sort of hairball that had been hacked up</p>
<p>over by that point four years.</p>
<p>And it also couldn&rsquo;t have the crypto module</p>
<p>for secure sockets, so called,</p>
<p>or now transport layer security.</p>
<p>That was an electronic munition.</p>
<p>We were not allowed to release that</p>
<p>in the full 1024 bit key strength.</p>
<p>And yet people, one of whom I happened to meet previously</p>
<p>at SGI when I went on a sales support engineering trip,</p>
<p>Tim Hudson in Brisbane, Australia,</p>
<p>and Eric A. Young did what became open SSL.</p>
<p>It was called SSL EAY after Eric&rsquo;s initials.</p>
<p>And Tim and Eric took their open SSL</p>
<p>outside of the purview of the NSA</p>
<p>and the Department of Commerce,</p>
<p>and they stuck it into Mozilla&rsquo;s code.</p>
<p>And that was perhaps the best hack that was done</p>
<p>in the first few months after we open sourced the browser.</p>
<p>We had other problems.</p>
<p>The politics inside Netscape were riven</p>
<p>by these acquisitions.</p>
<p>So the one acquisition that kind of messed up Netscape</p>
<p>for also wanted to keep doing a proprietary mail</p>
<p>and groupware program, not Jamie Zawinski&rsquo;s mail program</p>
<p>that was in Netscape two and three.</p>
<p>And they held it back from open source.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have a mail program, it was just a browser.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t know what AOL will do to us.</p>
<p>Turns out they didn&rsquo;t interfere with us for a long time.</p>
<p>But Netscape wasn&rsquo;t the best steward of Mozilla.</p>
<p>We were operating Mozilla as a pirate ship</p>
<p>without a legal entity.</p>
<p>So most of us worked for Netscape</p>
<p>under a separate organization.</p>
<p>And initially the first engineering manager,</p>
<p>Tom Paquin of Netscape was the Mozilla founding manager.</p>
<p>But he left pretty quickly</p>
<p>and he left me as the acting manager,</p>
<p>which is more like method acting in my case.</p>
<p>And that was my first management stint.</p>
<p>But then someone who&rsquo;d written the licenses,</p>
<p>Mitchell Baker, she was a lawyer at Netscape.</p>
<p>She was involved in the open source license decision making</p>
<p>and the actual writing and construction of those licenses.</p>
<p>That was Mitchell&rsquo;s job, Netscape public license</p>
<p>and the truly open Mozilla public license.</p>
<p>And there were two because Netscape needed,</p>
<p>because of some encumbered code, needed some special rights</p>
<p>but that went away over time.</p>
<p>Mitchell was always interested in Mozilla</p>
<p>and she came back from maternity leave</p>
<p>and she said, I&rsquo;ll be the manager if you want.</p>
<p>And Jamie and I said, sure.</p>
<p>And then Jamie quit, he quit after a year.</p>
<p>He said, this didn&rsquo;t work, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>He acted like it was a total failure</p>
<p>because Mozilla didn&rsquo;t restart the browser market.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no way it could have, right?</p>
<p>Netscape was still shipping variants of Netscape 4,</p>
<p>which was based on the old code.</p>
<p>Mozilla was trying to react to the code</p>
<p>to make greenfield for developers.</p>
<p>So it was one of my big goals.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a technical goal so much as again, a social goal.</p>
<p>People wanted a more standard spaced browser.</p>
<p>They wanted less of a hairball that had been hacked on</p>
<p>by ex grad students starting four years prior.</p>
<p>So we said, we&rsquo;re gonna make a modular code base.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna use a variant or an open source version</p>
<p>of Microsoft&rsquo;s component object model,</p>
<p>has reference counting and standardized V tables,</p>
<p>virtual calls and C++.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re gonna use JavaScript.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna have a bridge between those two</p>
<p>so you can script those components</p>
<p>just like Java components.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to make a portable front end</p>
<p>with a markup language for the user interface.</p>
<p>Not tables, not HTML, but custom menus</p>
<p>and dropdowns and toolbars.</p>
<p>And that was called Zool, XML user interface language.</p>
<p>And some real talent on the Netscape side delivered that.</p>
<p>Dave Hyatt, who was instrumental in Zool,</p>
<p>Chris Watterson, Joe Hewitt, Blake Ross.</p>
<p>And Blake was an intern.</p>
<p>He was like a high school aged intern at Netscape.</p>
<p>And at some point we were innovating rapidly</p>
<p>in the Mozilla world and Netscape was still caught up</p>
<p>in this management mess from these acquisitions</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t delivering.</p>
<p>And every year they were wondering if ALO was gonna come</p>
<p>and start beheading the executives</p>
<p>because it didn&rsquo;t do anything useful.</p>
<p>And there was this thought</p>
<p>you should take the Netscape browser engine</p>
<p>and put it in the Windows ALO client,</p>
<p>which was the dial up client</p>
<p>that all the increasingly aging users of ALO were using.</p>
<p>Never happened.</p>
<p>It would have been too big a change.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t clear why ALO bought Netscape,</p>
<p>but as I said, they left it alone.</p>
<p>But Netscape didn&rsquo;t leave Mozilla alone.</p>
<p>And so in 2001, Mitchell called me up and said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no longer employed.</p>
<p>And I was like, what?</p>
<p>You quit?</p>
<p>No, no, this wasn&rsquo;t my choice.</p>
<p>And there was a layoff which maybe accidentally</p>
<p>or on purpose got rid of Mitchell.</p>
<p>But the funny thing was we had an open source project.</p>
<p>We had a lot of the engineers on staff on our side</p>
<p>and we had people we&rsquo;d hired through the Mozilla community</p>
<p>who were top notch.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d risen, they came in high quality, they knew the code</p>
<p>and they actually were better than the average</p>
<p>or median hire of Netscape.</p>
<p>And so the funny thing was the executive</p>
<p>who thought they&rsquo;d gotten rid of Mitchell in the layoff</p>
<p>on the next week&rsquo;s community call around Mozilla</p>
<p>and what to do, there&rsquo;s Mitchell.</p>
<p>And so this showed you can kind of transcend</p>
<p>your boundaries of corporate open source</p>
<p>if you get a project that has enough loyalty,</p>
<p>even among the paid staff.</p>
<p>Because we had outside people contributing.</p>
<p>We had people at Red Hat and a few other places,</p>
<p>but the majority of the hackers were employed by Netscape.</p>
<p>But a lot of them at that point had come from the community</p>
<p>and others got the community and wanted to work with it.</p>
<p>And it was really the weakest engineers at Netscape</p>
<p>who didn&rsquo;t like Mozilla and didn&rsquo;t like the crucible</p>
<p>of competing with the better programmers.</p>
<p>So if the project is good enough, it will rise,</p>
<p>the Phoenix will rise out of the&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>And so we had this Mozilla code base</p>
<p>that was getting better.</p>
<p>In fact, I think at some point in 2002</p>
<p>when we declared Mozilla 1.0, I engineered a roadmap</p>
<p>that successively through similar sort of six week,</p>
<p>five week releases, like we all do with browser releases</p>
<p>nowadays, Chrome does and Firefox braved us three weeks.</p>
<p>We got to a point where we said, you know what?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t suck.</p>
<p>This is like the 1.0 that you want to release</p>
<p>because if you hold it back any longer to polish it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re denying others the ability to use it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like pro engineer, the mechanical CAD tool</p>
<p>embedded the code, they embedded the layout engine.</p>
<p>And Mozilla 1.0 was like a Netscape communication suite.</p>
<p>We had at that point gotten male people</p>
<p>to reintegrate mail and news and we had an editor for HTML.</p>
<p>And it felt like a 90s suite, suiteware.</p>
<p>And it felt kind of bloated.</p>
<p>And the people who were taking that Mozilla open source</p>
<p>and then adding Netscape flavor to it</p>
<p>were not calling the shots right.</p>
<p>And they were also under AOL&rsquo;s thumb a little bit</p>
<p>and that they said, well, we should probably put</p>
<p>the AOL instant messenger chicklet on the toolbar.</p>
<p>We should put the ICQ, the other messaging system</p>
<p>that AOL had acquired.</p>
<p>We should put the ICQ button on the toolbar.</p>
<p>And pretty soon Netscape looked like a bit of a NASCAR</p>
<p>badged version of Mozilla.</p>
<p>And that also made Mozilla more popular.</p>
<p>And yet they had contrived to fire or lay off the leader</p>
<p>and we carried on with an open source structure</p>
<p>where Mozilla was still, you know, Mitchell was calling</p>
<p>sort of management or project level shots</p>
<p>and I was calling technical shots.</p>
<p>And we had a popular suite, but we thought,</p>
<p>why not make it just a browser?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;ll be simpler, it&rsquo;ll do one job well.</p>
<p>And even then we can strip it down by having extensions.</p>
<p>So Dave Hyatt and Blake Ross, the high school aged intern</p>
<p>did the first version, which was called Mozilla slash browser.</p>
<p>It was very, the small group of us, Ian Hicks</p>
<p>and Asa Dotzler, me and Joe Hewitt and Hyatt and Blake.</p>
<p>And Hyatt was really the senior hacker.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d done all these things like amazing cross platform menus</p>
<p>through the user interface, markup language.</p>
<p>And he knew how to do tab browsing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d implemented it natively on Mac OS at the time</p>
<p>in Camino originally called Chimera.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d written multiple implementations,</p>
<p>which was a thing programmers should do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the V8 team did for those missing years</p>
<p>when the rest of the Chrome team&rsquo;s like, where&rsquo;s V8?</p>
<p>In fact, Dave&rsquo;s wife, Rebecca told me a story</p>
<p>about when they were at UIUC,</p>
<p>they were also University of Illinois grad students.</p>
<p>There was an assignment, it was a programming assignment</p>
<p>it was supposed to do at the end of the semester.</p>
<p>And Dave&rsquo;s friend was this, I&rsquo;m gonna go think</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna design and I&rsquo;m gonna make this</p>
<p>platonic perfect form of the program.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m gonna write it at the end when it&rsquo;s due.</p>
<p>And Hyatt just went there and started hacking.</p>
<p>He wrote one version, he wrote a second version,</p>
<p>a third version, end of the semester comes around.</p>
<p>The friend&rsquo;s not doing too well.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t perfect and it wasn&rsquo;t written.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how that story ended for him,</p>
<p>but Dave&rsquo;s version was a fifth iteration, it was great.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;d done that with everything you need</p>
<p>in a tabbed browser.</p>
<p>And this really showed well in Phoenix,</p>
<p>what we called Phoenix and I had to rename two more times.</p>
<p>And Blake went to Stanford, he became a Stanford student</p>
<p>and couldn&rsquo;t work on it.</p>
<p>Dave Hyatt went to Apple in 2001.</p>
<p>He was one of the founding Safari team members.</p>
<p>Interesting, wow.</p>
<p>But he was still blogging about tabbed browsing.</p>
<p>I think Apple at some point said you should.</p>
<p>Safari have tabbed browsing?</p>
<p>Yeah, but it was because of Hyatt.</p>
<p>Hyatt was quite a feather in their cap.</p>
<p>Don Melton, who had been the engineering manager</p>
<p>for Safari from the beginning, had been in Netscape also.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s this diaspora of talent</p>
<p>and yet Hyatt was still kind of writing blog posts</p>
<p>about how to do tabs right.</p>
<p>And at some point Apple said, don&rsquo;t blog about that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our proprietary tab technology.</p>
<p>And I was like, no, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>It was an opera and I&rsquo;ve refined it.</p>
<p>So we had to replace people and we had Ben Goodger,</p>
<p>a New Zealander we hired at Netscape.</p>
<p>And he stepped in to be the Firefox lead.</p>
<p>And we also had this weird circumstance</p>
<p>where AOL finally did notice that Netscape</p>
<p>was kind of an albatross,</p>
<p>that they bought it for no particular benefit.</p>
<p>And even then the AOL politics were also heinous,</p>
<p>sort of East Coast politics.</p>
<p>I remember taking two trips there</p>
<p>because I was a principal engineer.</p>
<p>And so us principal engineers got trotted out</p>
<p>to do dog and pony shows in Dallas, Virginia.</p>
<p>And the AOL opera management was very East Coast in flavor.</p>
<p>And they were at that time merging with Time Warner,</p>
<p>which did not go well.</p>
<p>So one of these years we went out there</p>
<p>and we were all doing dog and pony shows</p>
<p>and there were these characters</p>
<p>that were sort of like marketing guys.</p>
<p>One of them was wearing a cravat</p>
<p>and one was named Reggie.</p>
<p>And they were very you rather than non you.</p>
<p>Or they were like what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s Stoneman&rsquo;s</p>
<p>metropolitan film, UHB, urban haute bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>They were haute bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>They were funny and they were kind of useless</p>
<p>and kind of preppy.</p>
<p>And then the next year we went back</p>
<p>and I said, where&rsquo;s Reggie?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, oh, Reggie&rsquo;s not here anymore</p>
<p>because Time Warner realized that the merger</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t in their interest either.</p>
<p>And then the sort of knives came out.</p>
<p>And these mergers rarely work, right?</p>
<p>This is very difficult.</p>
<p>You get these giant companies</p>
<p>and they think there&rsquo;s gonna be synergy.</p>
<p>That was the 90s, late 90s watch word.</p>
<p>And there wasn&rsquo;t synergy with AOL buying Netscape</p>
<p>and there wasn&rsquo;t synergy with Time Warner and AOL.</p>
<p>But did AOL ever really work?</p>
<p>Was it ever really cool?</p>
<p>Like the same kind of fire and excitement</p>
<p>that Firefox eventually created,</p>
<p>was that ever there in AOL?</p>
<p>AOL was the right time to do a dial up service</p>
<p>that got distribution by basically</p>
<p>leaflet bombing compact discs on the country.</p>
<p>And they beat out CompuServe and the other ones,</p>
<p>Prodigy, and then the web happened.</p>
<p>And so you had almost like this isolated continent,</p>
<p>like some of the evolutionary biologists I follow</p>
<p>make fun of the funny large marsupial mammals of Australia,</p>
<p>how silly they are.</p>
<p>And so AOL is like Australia.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you saw it over time because they kept aging</p>
<p>and they were using AOL to get online</p>
<p>and they couldn&rsquo;t really use a web browser.</p>
<p>And it became sort of a valued cohort</p>
<p>because they still have relatively high</p>
<p>socioeconomic status and they have grandchildren,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s going away, it&rsquo;s dying at some point.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the aughts, that decade,</p>
<p>and then to the decade 2010 plus,</p>
<p>that Firefox became this incredible,</p>
<p>I forget when Chrome came out, but.</p>
<p>2008, September.</p>
<p>2008, but Firefox was the sexy cool thing</p>
<p>that represented a lot of the cutting edge technologies</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Web 2, it was amazing.</p>
<p>Kim O&rsquo;reilly and John Battelle did the first Web 2 conference</p>
<p>which eventually became huge and they split it.</p>
<p>But that was in 2004, it was right when Firefox was out.</p>
<p>Craigslist was huge, it was killing classified revenue</p>
<p>for newspapers, but there was just this ferment.</p>
<p>People starting.</p>
<p>Wikipedia along there somewhere.</p>
<p>Gmail was already done and it was an impressive web mail.</p>
<p>There were others before it like Hotmail,</p>
<p>but Gmail was really impressive from Google.</p>
<p>And Google Maps, people started seeing what could be done.</p>
<p>They thought how can you drag the map around</p>
<p>and how does that work?</p>
<p>And it was all JavaScript and images and.</p>
<p>So Gmail was 2003, four?</p>
<p>Yeah, it actually started quite early.</p>
<p>It might&rsquo;ve been 2002 or three,</p>
<p>but by the time we started dealing with Google and Firefox</p>
<p>to get the search deal,</p>
<p>which was the main revenue source for Mozilla,</p>
<p>and still is, 2004, early, Sergey Brinz,</p>
<p>one of his trusted engineer guys, Fritz Schneider,</p>
<p>made contact with me at Mozilla and we started talking</p>
<p>and we realized search and browser need each other.</p>
<p>And this is deeply true, right?</p>
<p>This is still true.</p>
<p>This is why a lot of the search engines</p>
<p>have their own browsers.</p>
<p>Yeah, so in case people don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>the main revenue source for the browser</p>
<p>is the default search engine,</p>
<p>which is kind of incredible to think about</p>
<p>that that is a revenue source.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit sad.</p>
<p>Yeah, it leads to this capture or kill effect</p>
<p>where you have the search engine own its own browser</p>
<p>and other browsers may struggle to get the distribution</p>
<p>we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>So where, and you said you&rsquo;ve figured out</p>
<p>that Google is working on its own browser</p>
<p>at some point there.</p>
<p>2006, yeah.</p>
<p>2006, so would you say Firefox versus,</p>
<p>was Internet Explorer part of the war here</p>
<p>or was the Firefox versus Chrome?</p>
<p>So Firefox didn&rsquo;t quite cause Microsoft to reconvene IE.</p>
<p>They did do IE7 and I remember being on a plane</p>
<p>back from the standards meeting,</p>
<p>JavaScript standards meeting from Seattle, from Redmond,</p>
<p>and there was some Microsoft guy in front of me.</p>
<p>Turns out my wife knew him from her past life</p>
<p>before we married and he was just this bearded big guy</p>
<p>and he was like,</p>
<p>we should have just killed Firefox in the cradle.</p>
<p>All we needed to do was add pop up blocking in tabs</p>
<p>and we could have made Internet Explorer kill Firefox.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, shoulda, coulda, woulda, pal.</p>
<p>And I was right behind him during this.</p>
<p>But they didn&rsquo;t, they were slow</p>
<p>and IE7 wasn&rsquo;t that great.</p>
<p>And what really got them started I think was Chrome.</p>
<p>And I talked to Larry Page in 2005,</p>
<p>I think I said, we&rsquo;re talking about the Firefox relationship</p>
<p>but he was also saying, what about WebKit?</p>
<p>This was Apple&rsquo;s version of the old KHTML engine from Linux,</p>
<p>the KDE side of Linux that was used in the Conqueror browser</p>
<p>also with Ks that Apple had forked.</p>
<p>And in 2005 was when Apple&rsquo;s principals</p>
<p>including Dave Hyatt, Maciej Stokowiak,</p>
<p>some of my friends who are still there said,</p>
<p>we must stop patch bombing this poor KHTML project.</p>
<p>We should make a proper Mozilla like organization,</p>
<p>webkit.org.</p>
<p>Now it wasn&rsquo;t a separate nonprofit or anything.</p>
<p>It was still Apple, it was Apple controlled</p>
<p>but they made their fork first class</p>
<p>and they made it be something that they all worked in</p>
<p>and lived in.</p>
<p>And that was before Chrome.</p>
<p>And then Chrome, Larry Page said, what about WebKit?</p>
<p>I said, yeah, it&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>I have friends who work on it.</p>
<p>You might use that if you do your own browser.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you do your own browser?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about Firefox.</p>
<p>You should do your own browser.</p>
<p>You can have your own opinion of how it should work.</p>
<p>And sure enough they did.</p>
<p>So by 2006, we knew they&rsquo;d been working on it.</p>
<p>Some of my friends who&rsquo;d been at Netscape</p>
<p>did the original demo.</p>
<p>And the demo wasn&rsquo;t what you thought.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t have the fast JavaScript yet.</p>
<p>That was still off in Denmark on a farm.</p>
<p>Did it have tabs?</p>
<p>It had tabs because all browsers had tabs at this point.</p>
<p>And it had this software fault isolation I mentioned.</p>
<p>It was through process isolation.</p>
<p>So in theory, each tab has some operating system process.</p>
<p>And so what&rsquo;s gonna take your tab down?</p>
<p>Well, WebKit has bugs that can crash it</p>
<p>but Flash was still big then.</p>
<p>All the restaurant sites remember.</p>
<p>And Flash crashed a lot.</p>
<p>So the demo that I heard about,</p>
<p>my friends at Netscape as a lot of people did,</p>
<p>inside Google was the sad tab.</p>
<p>They showed an early version of Chrome</p>
<p>which is just this bare bones tab browser.</p>
<p>They loaded a site with a known Flash volume</p>
<p>and then suddenly Flash crashes.</p>
<p>And everyone expected the whole browser to go down.</p>
<p>But instead you got this little sad face in the tab</p>
<p>and you could reload it and there it is again.</p>
<p>So this was an improvement.</p>
<p>It was a real move for security.</p>
<p>It was based on a company they acquired</p>
<p>called Green Border.</p>
<p>They had some really big brains like Olfar Erlingsson</p>
<p>I think was involved.</p>
<p>And they had done some exotic security stuff</p>
<p>but they ended up simplifying it to this process isolation.</p>
<p>And it was good.</p>
<p>And Firefox didn&rsquo;t have it at the time.</p>
<p>So we were still struggling with security bugs.</p>
<p>So we knew Chrome was coming</p>
<p>but it took two more years to come out.</p>
<p>And we were still getting the Google search revenue</p>
<p>and we were still making Google the default engine</p>
<p>and Firefox was still growing.</p>
<p>Firefox grew I think until 2011.</p>
<p>That was when it peaked.</p>
<p>And as it started falling, it was because of Chrome.</p>
<p>Chrome came out in 2008 and it had a comic book</p>
<p>that leaked accidentally that showed some of the people</p>
<p>who worked on it.</p>
<p>Lars Bock was in there and so on.</p>
<p>It was kind of soft launch</p>
<p>because they didn&rsquo;t market it heavily.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t push distribution.</p>
<p>But Google had reason to worry about distribution</p>
<p>because Microsoft was doing a search engine, Bing,</p>
<p>since 2007.</p>
<p>In fact, when they came out with Bing,</p>
<p>Google was worried that Microsoft would just brute force</p>
<p>switch the default browser in everyone&rsquo;s Internet Explorer</p>
<p>or even Firefox on Windows to Bing from Google.</p>
<p>And Microsoft wasn&rsquo;t I think ready</p>
<p>to dare the antitrust cops that way</p>
<p>even though they&rsquo;d gone to sleep.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think Bing was ready either.</p>
<p>But just in case it happened, Sundar Pichai,</p>
<p>who rose very well based on this work,</p>
<p>was sort of in charge of getting distribution deals.</p>
<p>And he got Google toolbar</p>
<p>and Google desktop search distribution.</p>
<p>And if you remember those pieces of software,</p>
<p>those were like desktop extensions,</p>
<p>toolbars or operating system extensions</p>
<p>for doing desktop search, searching your local files.</p>
<p>Kind of like Mac OS Spotlight, right?</p>
<p>Sadly, it died.</p>
<p>It all died.</p>
<p>And there were some features that we still missed</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t make it into Chrome.</p>
<p>But Sundar got OEMs to bundle those.</p>
<p>And then he got enough of those deals</p>
<p>that by 2007 or eight, Google felt,</p>
<p>well, if Bing, Microsoft does the worst</p>
<p>and tries to force Bing,</p>
<p>we can reach in and reset it with that point of presence.</p>
<p>So that was good for Sundar&rsquo;s career</p>
<p>and it was good for Google,</p>
<p>but it never came to pass that they had to defend.</p>
<p>Microsoft was still slow.</p>
<p>And by the time they saw Chrome come out,</p>
<p>then they did what would have been IE9.</p>
<p>And then they said,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have a fast JavaScript engine</p>
<p>to Chakra, Chakra core.</p>
<p>And they did okay.</p>
<p>They were another process isolated,</p>
<p>fast JavaScript browser, tab browser.</p>
<p>So it sounds like there&rsquo;s a deep fundamental coupling</p>
<p>of search engine and browser</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s mixing this whole thing up.</p>
<p>And obviously Firefox doesn&rsquo;t have a search engine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, I mean, you&rsquo;re partnering with somebody</p>
<p>with a search engine.</p>
<p>With Yahoo or with Google or so on.</p>
<p>They tried Yahoo, that was unfortunate</p>
<p>because I think even though Marissa Mayer talked about it,</p>
<p>she never pulled it off.</p>
<p>They never restored the search team</p>
<p>that had been laid off.</p>
<p>I believe Carol Bartz was running Yahoo</p>
<p>when Carol said, I&rsquo;ve got to get rid</p>
<p>of one of the three expensive things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get rid of search.</p>
<p>And those researchers went to Google and Microsoft</p>
<p>and there was no way to put Yahoo search back together.</p>
<p>So when Firefox tried switching all their users</p>
<p>who&rsquo;d stuck with a default from Google to Yahoo,</p>
<p>it was like mid December, 2014,</p>
<p>a bunch of users said, what just happened to my Firefox?</p>
<p>And others didn&rsquo;t notice right away,</p>
<p>but over time they did.</p>
<p>And so over the next year,</p>
<p>the traffic just went away for Yahoo.</p>
<p>And yet they were obliged, I understand it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have inside knowledge, but this has leaked out</p>
<p>and Danny Sullivan&rsquo;s written about it,</p>
<p>search engine land.</p>
<p>I think the deal was like fixed payments to Mozilla.</p>
<p>So Mozilla was getting a bunch of money for traffic</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t staying because users</p>
<p>were resetting their default.</p>
<p>And this shows how defaults are important,</p>
<p>but they have to be good enough</p>
<p>that the user doesn&rsquo;t override them.</p>
<p>And a lot of the commercial value in popular apps</p>
<p>is what are the default settings?</p>
<p>What is the default search?</p>
<p>But oftentimes there&rsquo;s something just like you said,</p>
<p>I mean, if there&rsquo;s something compelling</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also can beat out the default,</p>
<p>like tab browsing and so on.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where, I mean, we&rsquo;ll talk about brave browser.</p>
<p>It feels like now we&rsquo;re in this third stage</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a Chrome, Firefox, Edge,</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s called and brave.</p>
<p>And these are all seem like really exciting,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, innovative browsers.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all kind of copying off of each other,</p>
<p>picking up the good stuff.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s evolution again, especially on tracking protection.</p>
<p>So privacy is this sort of global wave that&rsquo;s rising.</p>
<p>I like to call it a wave because it&rsquo;s a large,</p>
<p>somewhat chaotic structure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a unitary good.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m buying privacy for $3,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m paying $3 privacy.</p>
<p>Some people think a VPN does this</p>
<p>and are disappointed when it fails them.</p>
<p>But often people use VPNs for region unlocking video</p>
<p>or getting the US Netflix catalog.</p>
<p>But privacy is not a unitary good, it&rsquo;s complex</p>
<p>and people are understanding it only over time</p>
<p>and as they get burned, but there&rsquo;s a genie</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not going back in the bottle there.</p>
<p>People are fed up.</p>
<p>Apple has responded to this.</p>
<p>Apple was always making Safari, I think,</p>
<p>more of a privacy branded browser from the very beginning.</p>
<p>I think this was probably Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>Safari had private windows, private tabs</p>
<p>before Firefox did.</p>
<p>And these are only private in the sense</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t leave local traces,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t want them to.</p>
<p>Turns out Safari does keep them around between shutdown.</p>
<p>But the canonical model is no local traces</p>
<p>after you close the private window.</p>
<p>No leftover traces that you went to some site</p>
<p>that you were embarrassed by</p>
<p>or bought a gift for somebody you wanted to keep secret.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s still some level of tracking.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s network tracking.</p>
<p>Network privacy is not guaranteed at all</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re using the same internet and ISP</p>
<p>as a public window, a non private window.</p>
<p>But, Safari had that early on.</p>
<p>They also had a cookie blocking policy</p>
<p>that might take a little explaining.</p>
<p>When you, if you know what a cookie is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit of storage in the browser</p>
<p>indexed by the name of the site.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really only the main name of the site,</p>
<p>like bofa.com or, you know, something like npr.org.</p>
<p>Every site can store some information in a cookie.</p>
<p>Every time it&rsquo;s contacted by the browser,</p>
<p>the previous version is sent back.</p>
<p>And in the response from the server, the cookie&rsquo;s updated.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this little bit of storage in the browser</p>
<p>that the site can keep updating</p>
<p>and it can store an encrypted version</p>
<p>of your login credentials with a timestamp</p>
<p>so you can stay logged in</p>
<p>without having to retype your password</p>
<p>every time you navigate,</p>
<p>which is how it would be if you didn&rsquo;t have cookies.</p>
<p>The web protocols, especially in the 90s,</p>
<p>are so called stateless protocols.</p>
<p>So you go to your bank, you log in,</p>
<p>you go from your login confirmed page</p>
<p>to your account view.</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t have a cookie, you&rsquo;d be logging in again.</p>
<p>Every time you type in the source.</p>
<p>So that was the great thing about cookies.</p>
<p>Luhmann truly did it in a hurry in 1994</p>
<p>before I joined Escape</p>
<p>and he did it for really holding that kind of credential.</p>
<p>But even then there was the image element</p>
<p>embedded in the page</p>
<p>and the image gets fetched possibly from a different server</p>
<p>and that request carries the last cookie,</p>
<p>which could be empty at first,</p>
<p>and the response carries the updated cookie.</p>
<p>So just by having images and cookies,</p>
<p>you got tracking because that image server</p>
<p>can be serving a little one by one pixel</p>
<p>and they still use the word pixel in ad tech.</p>
<p>And that pixel can be served from the same server,</p>
<p>embedded differently with different URL spellings</p>
<p>in the New York Times and ESPN.</p>
<p>And as you go from one to the other,</p>
<p>the image server can say,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t got a cookie for you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s empty initially.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna assign you user number 1234.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna put a database entry in.</p>
<p>And I see, by the way,</p>
<p>I always fetch the name of the path part of the URL</p>
<p>that I was in the New York Times.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a New York Times reader.</p>
<p>And then you hit ESPN, same thing.</p>
<p>And the database gets updated</p>
<p>and the number user 1234 indexes in the database</p>
<p>to a profile of you, you&rsquo;ve been tracked.</p>
<p>This was not intended.</p>
<p>And it was too late to undo by the time I got the Netscape.</p>
<p>I think Lou wanted to do Twinkies, he called them.</p>
<p>And he was trying to solve several problems.</p>
<p>He wanted them to be bigger</p>
<p>because initially cookies had a short size limit.</p>
<p>I think he wanted to solve the third party problem,</p>
<p>but Tom Paquin, the engineering manager said,</p>
<p>nope, no Twinkies, just cookies.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re done, son.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how a lot of that stuff was.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how JavaScript got frozen</p>
<p>like a flying Amber in some ways</p>
<p>with that sloppy equality operator that I made</p>
<p>because of the early adopters.</p>
<p>And the cookie got stuck with this tracking hazard.</p>
<p>And then because JavaScripts can be like images,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re embedded in the page.</p>
<p>By the time Netscape 3, I made that work.</p>
<p>You can get a request with the last cookie value</p>
<p>and the response updates it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a tracking mechanism.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why you don&rsquo;t even need images to track.</p>
<p>Now you just use scripts.</p>
<p>So this whole tracking economy evolved</p>
<p>and it depended on these accidents of the 90s,</p>
<p>these unintended consequences.</p>
<p>Well, it created some of the richest companies</p>
<p>in the world, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the social media.</p>
<p>All I got was T shirts.</p>
<p>All I got is this crappy T shirt.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, so that&rsquo;s the fundamental problem</p>
<p>the world is facing now.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re looking at what social media has created</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re looking at,</p>
<p>and like a world is looking at itself in the mirror</p>
<p>and seeing that privacy is actually something</p>
<p>as opposed to like a nice thing to have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that is actually should be fundamental</p>
<p>to the way we interact with the world</p>
<p>as part of our tooling.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the Brave browser comes in.</p>
<p>And I suppose others as well are playing with this idea,</p>
<p>but Brave is at the forefront of that.</p>
<p>So maybe can you like describe what Brave is</p>
<p>and what are its key principles and what&rsquo;s broken</p>
<p>and what is it Brave trying to fix?</p>
<p>So when I realized that these accidents</p>
<p>like the third party cookie,</p>
<p>the image or script that&rsquo;s tracking you</p>
<p>or the JavaScripts that can do an invisibly now,</p>
<p>that all this stuff wasn&rsquo;t intended</p>
<p>and that Firefox had supported extensions</p>
<p>that block some of these things,</p>
<p>I thought probably we should have browsers</p>
<p>just block some of these things by default.</p>
<p>These were not intended and they&rsquo;re now unsafe.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re tracking you.</p>
<p>There could be data breaches, malware distribution,</p>
<p>bullying and psyops and other attacks on people.</p>
<p>Block that stuff, block that JavaScript.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Dr. Frankenstein, I&rsquo;ve got to deal with a monster here.</p>
<p>But obviously you go to Gmail,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of script there</p>
<p>to make that amazing web client.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s okay, that&rsquo;s first party JavaScript.</p>
<p>So how do you tell the first from the third party?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not easy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a matter of just what&rsquo;s embedded</p>
<p>from a different server because a lot of publishers</p>
<p>use benign scripts from unrelated domains</p>
<p>or apparently unrelated domains.</p>
<p>So you end up having to develop a sort of human</p>
<p>and machine learning practice around blocking.</p>
<p>And at Brave, we did that from the start</p>
<p>and built a research team to help drive it and automate it.</p>
<p>We realized that protecting people needed machine learning</p>
<p>and around 2017 spring,</p>
<p>I talked to my friends at Apple about this too</p>
<p>and they were also doing</p>
<p>what they call intelligent tracking prevention,</p>
<p>which uses local machine learning in the browser.</p>
<p>And the funny thing is, great minds think alike,</p>
<p>they were taking their third party cookie blocker</p>
<p>that was in Safari from the old days</p>
<p>and making it not have a big loophole.</p>
<p>Because what they did was in 2003, when Safari came out,</p>
<p>they said, we&rsquo;re gonna block cookies</p>
<p>that are from those third party embedded elements</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve never visited that site before.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna pick an ad company that got sold to AT&amp;T,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not picking on anybody unfairly, appnexus.com.</p>
<p>Have you ever been to appnexus.com?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been there, but I guarantee you 10 years ago,</p>
<p>you probably had, if you were using Firefox,</p>
<p>you had a cookie, third party cookie,</p>
<p>because you were being tracked by them</p>
<p>and they were using that cookie</p>
<p>to build up a profile of you.</p>
<p>In Safari, as long as the user never went to appnexus,</p>
<p>that cookie would not be set.</p>
<p>And that was a real move for privacy early on</p>
<p>when jobs were still around in Safari.</p>
<p>But it had this loophole that if you do go to appnexus,</p>
<p>then why it&rsquo;s okay to be a third party cookie.</p>
<p>And so appnexus did something very naughty.</p>
<p>They took their ad partners</p>
<p>to put the actual ad you click on.</p>
<p>And they said, hey, add a little script</p>
<p>so that when somebody clicks on the ad,</p>
<p>before it goes to your landing page,</p>
<p>redirect to appnexus and we&rsquo;ll redirect</p>
<p>to the landing page.</p>
<p>And by doing that, they set a first party cookie</p>
<p>and they got whitelisted.</p>
<p>So it was a loophole they exploited.</p>
<p>Intelligent tracking prevention in Safari</p>
<p>was sophisticated enough to counteract this</p>
<p>and it did other things and it&rsquo;s evolved since they did it.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve evolved brave too.</p>
<p>And so when I say machine and human learning,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a real set of techniques here.</p>
<p>They have to fight.</p>
<p>This is a fascinating problem.</p>
<p>Fingerprinting, right?</p>
<p>Anytime you have a little bit of storage in the browser</p>
<p>associated with a website,</p>
<p>if the bad guy can get 32 websites,</p>
<p>each one has a bit of storage, that&rsquo;s 32 bits.</p>
<p>You can turn the bit on or off,</p>
<p>you can make 4 billion numbers,</p>
<p>you can make an identifier.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called a super cookie sometimes.</p>
<p>There are weaker ways that are statistical.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called fingerprinting.</p>
<p>You have to block all of them</p>
<p>and you have to not only automate,</p>
<p>you want to work in the web standards body</p>
<p>to put privacy in by default, by design,</p>
<p>from the get go, not add it as an afterthought</p>
<p>or go hogwile with new web APIs</p>
<p>to add a bunch more local storage or fingerprint surface area.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been a struggle too,</p>
<p>because guess who&rsquo;s the new Microsoft</p>
<p>in the standards body?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Google.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not in favor of privacy first.</p>
<p>They want to do privacy their way,</p>
<p>only under, I would say, market pressure.</p>
<p>But with Apple and with Brave leading the way,</p>
<p>we block third party cookies almost without exception.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve just blocked them.</p>
<p>And that gives us a very strong privacy benefit,</p>
<p>but it also means some sites just don&rsquo;t work right.</p>
<p>Embedded YouTube videos might not work right.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re adapting in a similar way to Apple&rsquo;s done with ITP</p>
<p>to make third party cookies blocked,</p>
<p>but to sort of simulate what looks like</p>
<p>a working third party cookie for the site.</p>
<p>It essentially tries to partition each site</p>
<p>and its third parties into its own sort of cookie jar.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>And so, like you said,</p>
<p>is this both like a human fine tuning issue</p>
<p>and a machine learning problem?</p>
<p>And as the humans learn,</p>
<p>then they train the machine learning.</p>
<p>But, you know, maybe Google aside or including Google,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s millions of dollars, if not B,</p>
<p>billions of dollars to be made</p>
<p>from fighting the ways of Brave.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been an interesting change</p>
<p>from when we started in 2015.</p>
<p>When we started, you know, ad blocking extensions,</p>
<p>ad block plus was one of the big ones</p>
<p>that started on Firefox in 2006, I believe,</p>
<p>had gotten to a certain level of use around the world.</p>
<p>And browsers like UC Web, UC Browser in Asia</p>
<p>had some amount of ad blocking built in and on by default.</p>
<p>So, a page fair was a startup</p>
<p>and they measured ad blocking adoption.</p>
<p>And they tried to say,</p>
<p>hey publishers, you&rsquo;re, you know,</p>
<p>30% of the visitors to Pitchfork or Wire</p>
<p>to Conda NAS properties are using ad blockers.</p>
<p>If we can somehow convince them</p>
<p>to lower their ad blocking for your site,</p>
<p>that could be like a 43% lift, right?</p>
<p>And, you know, three sevenths.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s easier said than done.</p>
<p>And PageFair and others, SourcePoint,</p>
<p>and many others tried to either smuggle ads through</p>
<p>or cajole the user into letting, you know, ads appear.</p>
<p>And it didn&rsquo;t really work.</p>
<p>And meanwhile, the ad blocking adoption</p>
<p>has just continued intelligent tracking prevention</p>
<p>in Safari in 2017, Brave from 2016 on</p>
<p>with very strong cookie blocking and other protections.</p>
<p>And this is not going away.</p>
<p>The publishers used to rage against it.</p>
<p>Like we would try to say, we can help you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re dealing with users</p>
<p>who are already blocking all your ads.</p>
<p>We can try to put back some economics</p>
<p>that help the user and you</p>
<p>that led to the basic attention token</p>
<p>that we started with Bitcoin.</p>
<p>We can be your friend.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t just fingerprint us as an ad blocker</p>
<p>and treat us as an enemy.</p>
<p>But in 2015 or 16, it was like,</p>
<p>nah, you&rsquo;re an ad blocker.</p>
<p>Get out of here.</p>
<p>I hate you.</p>
<p>And by 2017 or 18, it&rsquo;s like something&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>The ad blocking is not stopping</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re all getting sort of pulled</p>
<p>on the Google&rsquo;s plantation through AMP, AMP.</p>
<p>Or we&rsquo;re getting killed by the Google ad system we use</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s taking all the revenue</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s permitting or some other vendors we use</p>
<p>are permitting ad fraud.</p>
<p>And so a fake New York Times is getting paid</p>
<p>by the marketer running an ad that a bot clicks on.</p>
<p>And the real New York Times</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s supposed to get the ad doesn&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something really broken</p>
<p>about that kind of system.</p>
<p>And that fraud is mediated through Google&rsquo;s ad exchange,</p>
<p>which is the biggest of them all.</p>
<p>And Google takes a fee.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a flip side of that,</p>
<p>which is malware distribution, malvertising,</p>
<p>where fake advertisers put malware payloads</p>
<p>in or exploit hit loaders in JavaScript</p>
<p>and they smuggle them in ads onto real publisher pages,</p>
<p>the ad exchange takes the fee.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not a lawyer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna say this is a RICO predicate,</p>
<p>but why is the ad exchange facilitating fraud</p>
<p>and malware distribution and taking a fee?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not right.</p>
<p>As opposed to just fighting,</p>
<p>this is the really interesting thing about Brave</p>
<p>is as opposed to just fighting</p>
<p>and then being treated like an ad blocker,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re providing an alternate.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a philosophical idea here</p>
<p>that might change the nature of the internet</p>
<p>with the basic attention token.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, maybe what is basic attention token BAT</p>
<p>and how does it work?</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ll tell the story first by saying how I came to it.</p>
<p>I realized for a long time at Firefox,</p>
<p>we were dependent on this Google search deal.</p>
<p>And I thought, now that Chrome&rsquo;s out,</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s gonna go away.</p>
<p>And they just, at some point, Google will say,</p>
<p>Firefox, like old yeller, you saved me from the rabid beast,</p>
<p>now I have to shoot you in the head.</p>
<p>Done your job, sad but true, goodbye.</p>
<p>And what could we do?</p>
<p>And I think Mozilla doesn&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>This is something that I couldn&rsquo;t solve there</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think they can solve.</p>
<p>But I thought, why is the browser</p>
<p>the sort of passive servant of these big tech companies?</p>
<p>Why is it a blind runtime for ad tech JavaScripts,</p>
<p>including from Google?</p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t it block some?</p>
<p>And if it blocks some, why can&rsquo;t it reconnect users,</p>
<p>readers, fans with publishers, creators, websites?</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t it help people make direct payments</p>
<p>or even possibly get an ad revenue share for private ads</p>
<p>that are placed in the browser?</p>
<p>The ads are all placed in the browser.</p>
<p>Some people have this sort of model</p>
<p>that the server&rsquo;s painting the ad into some,</p>
<p>flash combined package or into some giant image</p>
<p>and then it all gets sent down, that&rsquo;s not how it works.</p>
<p>All the ads you see on the web are placed in your browser</p>
<p>by it calling out to various ad tech partners</p>
<p>and Google&rsquo;s among them.</p>
<p>And so if you block those scripts,</p>
<p>you break the advertising flow of money</p>
<p>from the brands and their agencies to the publishers.</p>
<p>And if you want to reconnect it directly with the user,</p>
<p>you have limited choices.</p>
<p>The user generally isn&rsquo;t gonna sign up</p>
<p>with a ACH bank connection or a credit card.</p>
<p>The publisher isn&rsquo;t gonna sign up the user</p>
<p>except as a subscriber and then they&rsquo;re gonna overcharge you</p>
<p>because they want you to cross subsidize all the content</p>
<p>and buy more than you read and all that stuff.</p>
<p>And how many, people are doing great who are big names</p>
<p>like New York Times and The Washington Post,</p>
<p>but how many subscriptions are you as a user gonna pay for?</p>
<p>This is why startups like Tony Hale Scroll</p>
<p>are trying to do a portable subscription system.</p>
<p>By the way, just a small tangent there,</p>
<p>even the New York Times is really annoying</p>
<p>how difficult it is to subscribe.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s way too many clicks.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t make it easy.</p>
<p>And I had friends a few years ago,</p>
<p>I think they fixed this, who would pay for the paper</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;d go online and they get upcharged</p>
<p>for the digital and there was no break.</p>
<p>There was no connection between them.</p>
<p>But publishers are not that technical</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t all get you to subscribe.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have a thousand subscriptions.</p>
<p>So for a long time, people talked about micropayments.</p>
<p>There was Blendle and other ones which came to the US,</p>
<p>but it didn&rsquo;t grow.</p>
<p>And I thought, if you have just a browser</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s protecting you by blocking</p>
<p>all this ad tech tracking junk,</p>
<p>it can provide you an option that uses cryptocurrency</p>
<p>to let you support your favorite sites</p>
<p>and even YouTube channels.</p>
<p>And that we prototyped with Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And that meant the user had to be of means to contribute</p>
<p>and willing to contribute,</p>
<p>but it could be done on the Bitcoin blockchain</p>
<p>and it could be fairly efficient</p>
<p>even though Bitcoin went through a period</p>
<p>when we had this prototype running in 2016 into 2017</p>
<p>where Bitcoin was very congested and very slow to confirm</p>
<p>and the fees got very high.</p>
<p>And a lot of users who were not Bitcoin maximalists</p>
<p>or even experienced,</p>
<p>we helped them out by embedding a Coinbase buy widget</p>
<p>and they had the income to buy, but it was hard.</p>
<p>It was like, do I buy $5 a month?</p>
<p>But the fee is like 450.</p>
<p>I better buy in larger batches, right?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, I don&rsquo;t wanna own that much Bitcoin.</p>
<p>So it became this painful thing.</p>
<p>And the real idea that I had of private ads</p>
<p>that pay the user a rev share</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t be realized alone in that kind of system.</p>
<p>In these cryptocurrency systems,</p>
<p>especially with the blockchain we switched to Ethereum,</p>
<p>you can have smart contracts.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin system is not turned complete.</p>
<p>So what you can do with the scripts is more limited,</p>
<p>but you can still do sort of clever things</p>
<p>even with Bitcoin script.</p>
<p>What we wanted to do was sort of a three sided ecosystem.</p>
<p>We wanted users, creators or publishers and advertisers.</p>
<p>And we wanted the advertisers to put money in</p>
<p>just like they do today,</p>
<p>but without going through the Googles and the app nexuses</p>
<p>and all these other ad tech companies,</p>
<p>because those companies take out a huge cut.</p>
<p>The Guardian in the UK once did an experiment for a month.</p>
<p>They bought out their own ad space.</p>
<p>They put in a pound and they were paid 30 pence.</p>
<p>70% was coming out to the intermediary vendors</p>
<p>they were using.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like the opposite of what the app store does.</p>
<p>The app store takes 30% and gives the publisher 70%.</p>
<p>So pretty broken, in the old days of the superstation TBS,</p>
<p>the media owner would get 85%.</p>
<p>So these splits have become really unbalanced</p>
<p>and the middle players, the ad tech vendors</p>
<p>are taking out way too much money.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re doing something worse, which has been noticed.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re letting not just the malware vendors,</p>
<p>but also the ad fraud side, which fakes the publishers</p>
<p>and clickbait merchants come in and steal traffic</p>
<p>from good sites.</p>
<p>Because once you have a certain audience identified</p>
<p>at one site, Jason Calconas told me this</p>
<p>about his experience with, I guess it was in Gadget,</p>
<p>I forget which site he was running.</p>
<p>But once he started using an ad partner</p>
<p>that was sharing his audience information</p>
<p>across multiple sites, he saw his competitors</p>
<p>stealing all his traffic.</p>
<p>And then what&rsquo;s worse is the clickbait sites</p>
<p>that just have much cheaper rates steal all that traffic.</p>
<p>And that facilitates fraud, facilitates fake news,</p>
<p>all sorts of problems.</p>
<p>So Gray blocks it and then we give users the ability</p>
<p>to give back and because we invented</p>
<p>the basic attention token on Ethereum,</p>
<p>we can do this three way split.</p>
<p>And we can give users a share of the revenue.</p>
<p>And if they want to take it out, they can.</p>
<p>Now, unfortunately for us and for all blockchain,</p>
<p>the regulators are saying,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have to know who you are.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the Treasury Department&rsquo;s FinCEN agency.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the Office of Foreign Asset Controls, OFAC.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the other regulators in the federal government</p>
<p>that take a very dark look at things like money laundering</p>
<p>and sending money to someone named Osama bin Laden.</p>
<p>So compliance starts to come in.</p>
<p>And even now they&rsquo;re threatening for pure Bitcoin</p>
<p>sending to some address.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a Coinbase, you&rsquo;re gonna have to know</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s at that address.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have to start.</p>
<p>Like the actual identities of people involved.</p>
<p>Yeah, now with Coinbase members,</p>
<p>you sign up and they know you</p>
<p>and they comply with the regulations.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a regulated money services business.</p>
<p>And, but if somebody&rsquo;s using their own self custody,</p>
<p>so called self custodial wallet</p>
<p>where they have the hardware private key</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not named and they want to send to that address,</p>
<p>our friends in the federal government are talking about</p>
<p>requiring at some threshold and knowing who that is.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Some threshold that&rsquo;s unreasonable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that big.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know how this will play out.</p>
<p>I think crypto is here to stay.</p>
<p>I think the beauty of being able to send peer to peer</p>
<p>without any bank in the middle,</p>
<p>without any huge wire charge and two day delay</p>
<p>and all that nonsense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful and I&rsquo;ve used it and I love it.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re pragmatists are brave about crypto.</p>
<p>And we realized that anything like a revenue split,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t facilitate without being licensed in a certain way</p>
<p>and it requires knowing who the user is.</p>
<p>So our default mode doesn&rsquo;t know who the user is.</p>
<p>It instead imputes to the user&rsquo;s browser,</p>
<p>some of the revenue and allows that browser</p>
<p>to steer it back to the creators.</p>
<p>And we do have to identify the creators.</p>
<p>But as things improve and who knows how it&rsquo;ll play out,</p>
<p>there should become a day when this full vision</p>
<p>can be done more fully on a blockchain.</p>
<p>But regulations and the practicalities of today&rsquo;s blockchains,</p>
<p>which are not that fast and not anonymous over time,</p>
<p>you fingerprint yourself over time.</p>
<p>We do some of this with the browser.</p>
<p>So one of the ideas of the basic attention token</p>
<p>is to make a hybrid system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s stronger than blockchain alone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the browser and the blockchain.</p>
<p>And the browser is this trusted endpoint software.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this universal app.</p>
<p>Everyone uses browsers.</p>
<p>The bigger the screen, the more you&rsquo;re in the browser</p>
<p>and the less you install fat clients for things.</p>
<p>I use Slack on Mac OS and it&rsquo;s like a browser.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s based on an electron framework we used to use.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s not that great.</p>
<p>Some of the people at Brave use Slack in Brave as a&hellip;</p>
<p>In the browser, yeah.</p>
<p>I use that often, yeah.</p>
<p>And I noticed on the iPad, I use apps less.</p>
<p>The smaller the screen, the browser got handicapped</p>
<p>by Apple and Android both.</p>
<p>And it also can be slower or not have the right affordances,</p>
<p>the interface with the security limited APIs.</p>
<p>But in principle, with the right permissioning,</p>
<p>you can make the web browser just as good as any app.</p>
<p>You make it be a super app.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of our mission at Brave.</p>
<p>So we want to have the economics that got captured</p>
<p>by these big tech companies through tracking</p>
<p>and through social networks.</p>
<p>We want to block that for your own safety</p>
<p>and then let you opt into a cleaner world</p>
<p>where you keep your data defended in your browser</p>
<p>and you can actually realize value from it.</p>
<p>So the way our ad system works,</p>
<p>I mentioned it being private, but how does that work?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t see your data at all.</p>
<p>All browsers are sort of the mother of all data feeds,</p>
<p>your history, all your searches at all engines.</p>
<p>Each engine sees the queries you send to it,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t see the others,</p>
<p>but the browser sees them all.</p>
<p>Machine learning in the browser that you can opt into</p>
<p>can study all that in a very complete way</p>
<p>and do a better job than Google does.</p>
<p>Google has cookie and scripts across the web</p>
<p>from acquiring DoubleClick, they have YouTube,</p>
<p>they have Android, they have search,</p>
<p>which is still their big revenue lane,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t see everything.</p>
<p>The browser sees everything.</p>
<p>And if it can do a good job locally,</p>
<p>and this is not advanced machine learning,</p>
<p>this is not TensorFlow, this is like SVMs now,</p>
<p>naive Bayes, then you can match intense signals,</p>
<p>intense signals from those data feeds,</p>
<p>searches, the queries, the history, how much you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>scrolling down a page, how much you redid a search.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all blind browser algorithm, we don&rsquo;t see that data.</p>
<p>And then pick the best ad from a fixed catalog per day.</p>
<p>And the catalog is fixed across a large population per day,</p>
<p>and it only updates once a day,</p>
<p>because new offers come in and old ones expire,</p>
<p>sometimes every week or every month.</p>
<p>And that catalog, and there can be many such catalogs,</p>
<p>is sold by our direct sales team.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re making an anonymous audience available</p>
<p>to advertisers without the advertisers tracking them.</p>
<p>Instead, each browser is a little machine learning system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s picking the best catalog entry.</p>
<p>Now, the catalog is not the ads, those are big, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a video or a webpage, it&rsquo;s just the link</p>
<p>to an edge cache, and there are many such edge caches.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not trying to protect them from seeing</p>
<p>your IP address, it&rsquo;s not really feasible.</p>
<p>We could use Tor, but we don&rsquo;t yet.</p>
<p>And then some keywords about the ad.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically like metadata and a link.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what the catalog consists of,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what the machine learning picks.</p>
<p>And the machine learning is learning</p>
<p>about the use specifically locally</p>
<p>in order to choose from the catalog of different ads.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t this possibly be like a multi billion dollar,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t this taken on the Google ad?</p>
<p>Could be.</p>
<p>So like what, I mean, one question to ask,</p>
<p>there seems to be some really profound ideas here</p>
<p>that are different than what the internet has grown up to be.</p>
<p>If Brave or something like Brave,</p>
<p>the ideas, the fundamental philosophical ideas</p>
<p>underlying Brave went out and runs 95% of the internet,</p>
<p>how does that change the, what are the major things</p>
<p>these changes about the internet?</p>
<p>So social networks and then the creatives,</p>
<p>like YouTube creators and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about that.</p>
<p>First of all, if Brave gets 95%,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna demand a recount, because I won&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I think we&rsquo;re trying to put things</p>
<p>into web standards that can be standardized across browsers.</p>
<p>So the main value of Brave will be the trust users have in us</p>
<p>and our ability to give the best deal to users.</p>
<p>So 70% of the gross ad revenue we give to the user.</p>
<p>And if they go through that KYC process I mentioned,</p>
<p>they can take it out.</p>
<p>They can also give it back, they can take some out,</p>
<p>give the rest back.</p>
<p>They can add basic attention tokens to give back.</p>
<p>Some of them turn off the ads,</p>
<p>cause they just don&rsquo;t like ads,</p>
<p>but they put in $20 a month.</p>
<p>But I believe Zuko of Zcashframe does that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very generous,</p>
<p>because the browser is just anonymously</p>
<p>based on his browsing, sort of keeping score</p>
<p>on how much time he spent on this video, on that website.</p>
<p>And if those sites verify in sort of a,</p>
<p>like getting a domain certificate fashion,</p>
<p>they can get paid, they can get part of his $20 a month.</p>
<p>So that vision could go big.</p>
<p>And if it does, I hope it&rsquo;s across multiple browsers.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that they&rsquo;ll all compete well</p>
<p>on the quality of the ads, the quality of the ad blocking</p>
<p>and tracking protection.</p>
<p>Those are subject to competition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll take a while to standardize them.</p>
<p>But I think that would be a better world.</p>
<p>It would have less counterparty risk,</p>
<p>fewer fee takers in the middle, really just the browser.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re taking 30%, sort of the app store split.</p>
<p>And if we get bigger, maybe we can take even less.</p>
<p>Social networks, creators.</p>
<p>If you look at YouTubers, a lot of them are the indies</p>
<p>that are getting some size are getting sponsorship deals.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re using Patreon.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re encouraging people to subscribe</p>
<p>and give them regular money through Patreon.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s centralized through Patreon.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s censorship hazards, there&rsquo;s a 5% fee.</p>
<p>What if that were a web standard?</p>
<p>What if Brave pioneered it first and we took 3%?</p>
<p>And we did it in a way that was through your browser</p>
<p>so we couldn&rsquo;t censor it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>Do you think it could be standardized across browsers?</p>
<p>Can Internet Explorer come in again and&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, protocols are easy to copy</p>
<p>in that they&rsquo;re meant to be interoperable.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a risk there.</p>
<p>And the loyal users might be tricked into leaving you.</p>
<p>Or they might, because of that distribution power,</p>
<p>you might end up getting stomped.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I can&rsquo;t predict the future.</p>
<p>I think antitrust is back on the case finally in the US.</p>
<p>And certainly in Europe, G Comp is doing its thing.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m hopeful that we&rsquo;ll have a period of innovation.</p>
<p>People were talking, like Elizabeth Warren was talking</p>
<p>about breaking up the tech companies very clearly.</p>
<p>Now she didn&rsquo;t win, and I suspect that won&rsquo;t happen,</p>
<p>but I also suspect that Google might be smart enough</p>
<p>to see they should do something more</p>
<p>than just put privacy perfume on Chrome.</p>
<p>They should maybe get rid of DoubleClick or something,</p>
<p>divest something.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it might happen.</p>
<p>So Brave might inspire Google to completely change</p>
<p>the way they&rsquo;re doing things in the browser?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re already doing something,</p>
<p>you may have read about called the Privacy Sandbox</p>
<p>or Flock, which they have this bird metaphor going,</p>
<p>Turtle Dove, Fledge.</p>
<p>But these systems have been very Googley,</p>
<p>kind of overengineered, and yet,</p>
<p>depending on differential privacy,</p>
<p>which has weakness over time, if you know how that works,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of injecting noise to hide you in a crowd,</p>
<p>but over time an adversary can pull you out of the crowd.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t look like it&rsquo;s gonna become a standard.</p>
<p>Like Apple, Brave, Mozilla, we&rsquo;re not gonna just say,</p>
<p>oh, Google, you saved us.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve invented the Privacy Sandbox,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ll all just adopt it.</p>
<p>Not gonna be that easy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be more like pieces of what we do in Brave,</p>
<p>the synonymous ad matching or the blind signature</p>
<p>cryptography we use to confirm the ad impressions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s David Chow&rsquo;s invention.</p>
<p>That could get standardized.</p>
<p>In fact, some of that is being standardized.</p>
<p>Even Google&rsquo;s in favor of so called trust tokens,</p>
<p>which are Chowmian blind signature certs.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re not using them for ad confirmations</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t wanna blow up their own business.</p>
<p>And they need to let some of the publishers they serve</p>
<p>have other ad tech scripts on the page.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re kind of caught.</p>
<p>And this is something I realized doing Brave.</p>
<p>I thought, what&rsquo;s Google&rsquo;s innovators dilemma</p>
<p>apart from just being mature and having trouble innovating?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that they have come to depend on this ad tech system</p>
<p>that has all these vendors that publishers rely on</p>
<p>because publishers aren&rsquo;t technical enough.</p>
<p>And I feel for the publishers,</p>
<p>but I realized the users have to come first.</p>
<p>And if you give the users a better browser that&rsquo;s faster,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ll get enough users to give back</p>
<p>or support publishers.</p>
<p>The speed and the battery savings</p>
<p>and the data plan savings are significant.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much bad JavaScript involved in ad tech</p>
<p>that if you block it, you sort of chop off</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called the programmatic waterfall,</p>
<p>which chains a bunch of requests.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s one of the incredible things about Brave.</p>
<p>I guess you&rsquo;re saying you should attribute it</p>
<p>to the fact that the messy JavaScript, no offense.</p>
<p>No offense.</p>
<p>Not my solution.</p>
<p>I mean, Brave just feels faster.</p>
<p>Even then, I mean, Chrome was fast.</p>
<p>One of the things that it was like impressive</p>
<p>is it showed that browsers can be really fast</p>
<p>and Brave is even faster than that, which is incredible.</p>
<p>And it saves the network, which means data plan.</p>
<p>It saves battery because the radio consumes your battery</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s running more to do those requests.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just stunning how many there are.</p>
<p>Like some of my Google friends were like,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s just that bad site.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll fix it.</p>
<p>And you actually do a survey of web pages</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re like mostly like that.</p>
<p>I know Google engineers could make everything</p>
<p>super efficient, but they can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>especially in antitrust court, do it.</p>
<p>They cannot take over all the publishers and do that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying with accelerated mobile profile, AMP.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to pull publishers.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, oh, you poor publishers</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know how to make your pages fast.</p>
<p>Put them on our AMP system.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll give you extra placement in the search carousel.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an antitrust problem for one.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also publishers we talk to hate it</p>
<p>because it degrades their brand.</p>
<p>Now they look like a gig writer wrote a piece</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s got Google&rsquo;s framing an AMP URL on top of it.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re trying to fix that too.</p>
<p>But it just looks like Google&rsquo;s Borgifying</p>
<p>all these publishers and they don&rsquo;t want to be plugged</p>
<p>into the Borg cube.</p>
<p>They want to build up their own brand and have loyal readers.</p>
<p>So, you know, I&rsquo;m in favor of giving the users power</p>
<p>to help all the publishers and the little platoons</p>
<p>and the creators.</p>
<p>And so we talked about Patreon.</p>
<p>What about social networks?</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re inherently like search, a global algorithm.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to find friends of friends.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing the transitive closure of a graph</p>
<p>induced by this friend of relation.</p>
<p>But you should own your friend relation.</p>
<p>You should own your posts.</p>
<p>They shouldn&rsquo;t be owned by somebody else</p>
<p>who can take them down or censor them.</p>
<p>And your friend relations, you should be able</p>
<p>to find those friends on other networks.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve tweeted about this.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t built it yet.</p>
<p>What if the browser could keep track of those for you?</p>
<p>What if the browser could maybe combine Facebook and Twitter</p>
<p>and you could find your friends on both</p>
<p>and you could have a sort of multi.</p>
<p>So that relationship is not owned by Facebook or Twitter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s owned by you through the browser.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll have terms of use and they&rsquo;ll say they own it.</p>
<p>But if they zap you on one and you&rsquo;re still on the other,</p>
<p>your friends find you and the browser</p>
<p>could preserve a combined view.</p>
<p>You could resurrect almost across networks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something I wanna maybe quickly ask you about.</p>
<p>On that front, there&rsquo;s been quite a lot of centralized,</p>
<p>we talked about Wall Street Bets and then Robinhood.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been centralized banning of different accounts</p>
<p>and removing like Parler, for example, from AWS</p>
<p>and this kind of overreach of centralized control.</p>
<p>Is your hope that it&rsquo;s possible to,</p>
<p>like what are your thoughts about that in general?</p>
<p>And then is it possible to create tools</p>
<p>that give individual people the power</p>
<p>to fight back against overreach of such control?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about oligarchy, I do think.</p>
<p>And if it controls a nation state, that&rsquo;s formidable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the tax and the police power, the military power.</p>
<p>It means that you may have the great firewall of China.</p>
<p>You may have people in China who are jailed</p>
<p>because of their tweets, right?</p>
<p>This is a serious threat.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t minimize it or say that we&rsquo;ll win.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how it&rsquo;s gonna go.</p>
<p>But I do think, like I said earlier</p>
<p>about the kind of reason people find ways around things.</p>
<p>The internet routes around censorship.</p>
<p>And this is not to endorse any particular bad faction.</p>
<p>One of the things that happens</p>
<p>when you try to wave the free speech flag too much,</p>
<p>you say, I&rsquo;m not gonna censor anything</p>
<p>and you get colonized by terrible, terrible people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if you call them neo Nazis,</p>
<p>some of them could be doing illegal things.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t want them colonizing</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;ll ruin your reputation</p>
<p>and destroy your business.</p>
<p>So what you really want is that kind of</p>
<p>user first subsidiarity, that subjectivity.</p>
<p>I want my social networks to be composited</p>
<p>in some multi social user interface</p>
<p>where I don&rsquo;t lose track of people across networks.</p>
<p>And if they leave one or they get banned from one,</p>
<p>I can find them on another,</p>
<p>I can still sort of thread them together.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>And this didn&rsquo;t happen because browsers</p>
<p>got captured by the central powers.</p>
<p>Why did they get captured?</p>
<p>Mostly because of search.</p>
<p>And search is a central algorithm.</p>
<p>So Larry Page said this too many years ago.</p>
<p>He said, with search, you&rsquo;re giving up a little privacy</p>
<p>by handing the query over to us.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll error correct it.</p>
<p>Alan used to be a Google executive.</p>
<p>He said, oh yeah, we used to laugh.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d all be doing typos and they&rsquo;d be typing</p>
<p>the wrong word.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;d be like, no dummy, type that query.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, okay Google,</p>
<p>might want to dial back that ego a little bit.</p>
<p>But yes, you do see all the queries</p>
<p>and you can improve them and you can find the best results.</p>
<p>And that was Google&rsquo;s forte.</p>
<p>When we did the Firefox deal in 2004,</p>
<p>Google was really good.</p>
<p>And over time, SEO, which is an adversarial game,</p>
<p>and Google itself buying all these companies</p>
<p>and crowding its own results page</p>
<p>with its own tied in stuff.</p>
<p>The YouTube.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a slippery slope that happens</p>
<p>when you have control over these kinds</p>
<p>of really important mechanisms.</p>
<p>Yeah, monopoly capitalism or cartel.</p>
<p>You get this with the Robin Hoods and the hedge funds.</p>
<p>You get sort of the money interests take over</p>
<p>and kind of abuse their power and wear out their welcome.</p>
<p>So how do you get around that?</p>
<p>You have to have either new land to go to,</p>
<p>which some people&rsquo;s ancestors, not mine,</p>
<p>did to found the country.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m mostly Irish, German.</p>
<p>You have new virtual space people go to</p>
<p>and that requires an ISP or a colo center</p>
<p>or Amazon to host you.</p>
<p>It requires domain name registrar who will not strike you.</p>
<p>And so when Parler was taken down,</p>
<p>I thought that was egregious.</p>
<p>Parler, it was not well designed</p>
<p>and I tried it out because I tried all these things,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t use it.</p>
<p>And I also felt they were being unfairly scored</p>
<p>for not moderating because you can find tweets to this day</p>
<p>that are horrendous and threaten all sorts of violence.</p>
<p>Whereas Twitter, why isn&rsquo;t Twitter being taken down?</p>
<p>But so it was very selective.</p>
<p>It was the insiders who have the power</p>
<p>are gonna take out the newcomer.</p>
<p>And it looked bad, sort of like the hedge funds,</p>
<p>shorting GameStop, looked bad.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re seeing a piece in Time Magazine this week</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like basically saying,</p>
<p>yeah, we interfere with the election,</p>
<p>but it was great, aren&rsquo;t we good?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve seen this piece yet.</p>
<p>If you tried to say that as a Trump supporter</p>
<p>in November after the election,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d get banned from Twitter.</p>
<p>But now Time in its Twitter account is saying,</p>
<p>we saved the day, it&rsquo;s AFL, CIO and big business,</p>
<p>the Better Business Bureau got together</p>
<p>and kept Trump from spreading fake news.</p>
<p>So the country&rsquo;s kind of broken.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to fix that.</p>
<p>The oligarchs have run wild in my opinion.</p>
<p>And big tech is in the antitrust dock.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s gonna happen?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they get out.</p>
<p>I think some of the DOJ and certainly the state cases,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re separate cases,</p>
<p>are not gonna go away just</p>
<p>because somebody got elected differently.</p>
<p>And these are career prosecutors</p>
<p>and they have a strong case.</p>
<p>And Google&rsquo;s smart.</p>
<p>And Microsoft almost got split up, right?</p>
<p>The judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, he overreached.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t hold a hearing about the remedy.</p>
<p>He just said, I&rsquo;m gonna break you up.</p>
<p>And Microsoft appealed and the higher level court said,</p>
<p>go back and figure this out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not breaking them up.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t even hold a hearing.</p>
<p>And when they got back, Microsoft said,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s settle, let&rsquo;s settle, we don&rsquo;t wanna get broken up.</p>
<p>Because Jackson was gonna make the Opsco,</p>
<p>the operating system company,</p>
<p>and the Appsco office, you know, Word and Excel.</p>
<p>And that would have been a huge blow to Microsoft, so.</p>
<p>But ultimately, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re optimistic</p>
<p>or cynical about the possibility of breaking up big tech.</p>
<p>To me, I&rsquo;m optimistic that tools like Brave,</p>
<p>I love the idea of owning your friendships.</p>
<p>Like users more and more owning the stuff</p>
<p>is the only real way.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s like the WallStreetBets subreddit</p>
<p>is the only real way to fight decentralized power.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t break them up with the regulation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>Certainly don&rsquo;t wanna wait for the law.</p>
<p>Netscape was long dead or acquired by AOL</p>
<p>and effectively dead.</p>
<p>It was only Mozilla that returned Firefox to the market</p>
<p>by the time that the US v. Microsoft case</p>
<p>was finally settled and the penalties were put in place.</p>
<p>And yet, antitrust has a role to play.</p>
<p>Those penalties caused Microsoft</p>
<p>to kind of turn away from the web.</p>
<p>They did Windows Vista and they thought,</p>
<p>the web&rsquo;s too painful.</p>
<p>We got punished in court and we had to standardize things</p>
<p>with those icky standards people.</p>
<p>So they ran back to proprietary lock in</p>
<p>and Windows Vista flopped.</p>
<p>It was late, it was bloated.</p>
<p>Longhorn, remember?</p>
<p>Now, what I was gonna say, but Google&rsquo;s smart enough,</p>
<p>they won&rsquo;t get split up.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll split something out to get off the hook, I think.</p>
<p>This is a complicated subject, but I myself was so,</p>
<p>I decided to journey out from the world</p>
<p>of being a researcher at MIT</p>
<p>and potentially doing a startup myself.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been thinking of, you know,</p>
<p>I wanted to come to Silicon Valley to do so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the land of the entrepreneur.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of my friends,</p>
<p>a lot of them are successfully,</p>
<p>have been entrepreneurs themselves,</p>
<p>have said, do not come to Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be, you&rsquo;ve started, you ran amazing teams of engineers.</p>
<p>You started a lot of successful businesses.</p>
<p>I wondered if you could comment on why a lot of people</p>
<p>are leaving California.</p>
<p>Is there something that could be fixed about California?</p>
<p>If you were starting a business today,</p>
<p>would you consider somewhere else,</p>
<p>like Austin or some other place?</p>
<p>Or is Silicon Valley still, is it just a little lull,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s being overdramatic during this particular year</p>
<p>of the coronavirus and so on?</p>
<p>I think, you know, even Austin&rsquo;s getting overheated, I hear.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve had relatives and friends move to Texas</p>
<p>within the last few months.</p>
<p>So Texas as a whole is a big place.</p>
<p>And, you know, people are moving to Florida.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a big movement toward Miami,</p>
<p>Peter Thielke, these people.</p>
<p>The mayor has been very business friendly about it,</p>
<p>which I think is just good politics.</p>
<p>America is fundamentally a commercial republic.</p>
<p>So you would think this would be what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>For a long time, California was the golden state.</p>
<p>I came here in late 76 when I was a teenager.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s in crushing debt due to the lockdowns.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got the highest taxes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s got to matter.</p>
<p>People will do high taxes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got likely fires every year because of the deadfall.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not global warming.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because the forests weren&rsquo;t managed</p>
<p>like they had been in the first part of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Just, I would say corruption at all levels,</p>
<p>especially up to the governor,</p>
<p>who famously was eating at the French Laundry</p>
<p>and claimed that the outside was inside.</p>
<p>And they wore masks off and it was great.</p>
<p>Do what I say, not what I do.</p>
<p>Rules for thee, but not for me.</p>
<p>When you see that in leadership,</p>
<p>people either run or they get rid of the leadership.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a recall drive,</p>
<p>which is about to reach the threshold.</p>
<p>Or in the old days, they get their guns, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t put up with this junk.</p>
<p>But ultimately, the thing that made Silicon Valley</p>
<p>a special place, it gave freedom to young kids,</p>
<p>entrepreneurs, young minds, brave minds</p>
<p>to think bold, to try different stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, even if the taxes are high,</p>
<p>so outside of financial stuff, outside of all of that.</p>
<p>Housing&rsquo;s super expensive.</p>
<p>Housing&rsquo;s super.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>Okay, everything about startups is hard.</p>
<p>Peninsula was narrow and they didn&rsquo;t plan the roads, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They got rid of public transportation in LA,</p>
<p>like the Who Framed Roger Rabbit cartoon show.</p>
<p>They used to have trolley cars in Portland too.</p>
<p>The oil companies and the DOD conspired to build highways</p>
<p>and make cars dominant.</p>
<p>And the rights of way are long gone.</p>
<p>Like Elon&rsquo;s gonna go underground.</p>
<p>And I wish him well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably the only way to do it now.</p>
<p>But is it still a place,</p>
<p>do you think it&rsquo;s possible that Silicon Valley</p>
<p>is still a place where magic happens?</p>
<p>Where the next Google&rsquo;s built?</p>
<p>Where the next, I mean, Brave is built where?</p>
<p>I think all good things come to an end.</p>
<p>I think the problem is Silicon Valley</p>
<p>had strong network effects through Stanford,</p>
<p>through the angel investor networks and the wealth effect.</p>
<p>And originally you have to give the federal government credit</p>
<p>like the ARPANET was a government project.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not kid ourselves.</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t wild free market, libertarian capitalism.</p>
<p>This was all Cold War stuff.</p>
<p>You had out of the academia, you had Shockley</p>
<p>and then the Traders Aid and Fairchild and Intel.</p>
<p>But now, when&rsquo;s the last fab that was built in the Valley?</p>
<p>MicroUnity might&rsquo;ve been the last, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t followed.</p>
<p>We built a fab in Sunnyvale and MicroUnity</p>
<p>in starting early 90s.</p>
<p>And now the fabs are overseas.</p>
<p>And the one thing that I would say</p>
<p>that the oligarchs have intentionally done</p>
<p>in both parties is sort of labor</p>
<p>and environmental protection law arbitrage</p>
<p>by going where the labor is cheaper</p>
<p>and the environmental laws aren&rsquo;t as strict.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s polluted the hell out of parts of China,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s made things, you can make cheaper junk.</p>
<p>And this is not a story that&rsquo;s over yet.</p>
<p>So what is Silicon Valley for now?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for the network effect, the brain trust</p>
<p>of who you know, the parties, the Stanford sort of network.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fragile too over time, I&rsquo;m afraid.</p>
<p>Stanford, a lot of good professors are like,</p>
<p>they still filter mainly based on socioeconomic status,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of a skate school.</p>
<p>I had a friend hired out of Harvard 20 years ago at Netscape</p>
<p>and we talked about Harvard and he said,</p>
<p>yeah, there&rsquo;s still professors who do great on the curve.</p>
<p>And I said, oh yeah, I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re any doing that</p>
<p>at Stanford anymore.</p>
<p>And he said, yo, it was shocking.</p>
<p>Some of the students got Cs and Ds and they were crying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yes, that&rsquo;s right, the precious deers</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t take that at Stanford, so they get As and Bs.</p>
<p>Now you look at China and people say what you all about China,</p>
<p>they prove Russia too, a lot of math science training,</p>
<p>a lot of engineering, a lot of people who are doing</p>
<p>their coursework to get the As and the Bs.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m an American, I&rsquo;m born on the 4th of July.</p>
<p>American, yeah.</p>
<p>4th of July, wow.</p>
<p>And America, as I say, fundamentally</p>
<p>is a commercial republic.</p>
<p>You can try to make it something else.</p>
<p>You can say it&rsquo;s the new Atlantis and mystify it.</p>
<p>You could talk about it in a more, I think, correct way,</p>
<p>which is 13 colonies that grew and then there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of local or original design anyway,</p>
<p>the federalist papers talk about this,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of subsidiarity,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s been eroded over time.</p>
<p>And like I say, a lot of the offshoring is hurt.</p>
<p>So what happened with coronavirus?</p>
<p>People working from home, and at first it was funny</p>
<p>because I have friends at Google who used to grumble</p>
<p>that not only did they have to come into the office,</p>
<p>if they joined a different team that was centered</p>
<p>in a different office, they had to move.</p>
<p>Or if the VA team was reconstituted in Munich,</p>
<p>which it was after Lars Bock just got tired of JavaScript,</p>
<p>that they hired in Munich or they hired PhDs</p>
<p>in Germany and moved them to Munich.</p>
<p>With coronavirus, everyone&rsquo;s working from home</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, what a relief, I can work for Google</p>
<p>from home.</p>
<p>But then the next shoe dropped and people started asking</p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg, hey, can I move to my hometown</p>
<p>in the Midwest?</p>
<p>And he said, okay.</p>
<p>And they said, oh, can I keep getting my Silicon Valley pay?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna figure out what your cost of living there is</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna adjust your pay accordingly.</p>
<p>And these colonies and these little mini experiments</p>
<p>that all combine to the big giant experiment,</p>
<p>I have a, I don&rsquo;t know, I have this vision of America,</p>
<p>which the country, I was born in Russia, like I said here,</p>
<p>and this is truly a wonderful country.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t born on the 4th of July, but I might as well be.</p>
<p>People still flee here.</p>
<p>I still, and I&rsquo;m a red blooded American at this point.</p>
<p>And I have a sense that we figured it out somehow.</p>
<p>If Silicon Valley burns, another place will come up</p>
<p>in this place that even more innovation and people will move</p>
<p>and the remote work might change fundamentally how we work</p>
<p>or it might not.</p>
<p>It might just give you the freedom to then create</p>
<p>many other small Silicon Valleys throughout the place,</p>
<p>like Austin included, but other places as well.</p>
<p>And we somehow figured it out and&hellip;</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s true that there will be more mobility</p>
<p>and maybe new places that come up.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Silicon Valley has passed some sell by date</p>
<p>because it did hurt.</p>
<p>The coronavirus hurt, the lockdowns hurt in the sense</p>
<p>that part of what keeps things going is social.</p>
<p>And so a lot of young people, even before coronavirus,</p>
<p>moved to San Francisco.</p>
<p>It was very strange to watch because in the 80s,</p>
<p>we all lived in the Valley and it was less populated</p>
<p>and San Francisco was grungier.</p>
<p>It was more like Dirty Harry in the 70s.</p>
<p>But by the 90s, and Jamie runs a nightclub there</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s talked about this, you had sort of wealthy</p>
<p>tech people moving in south of market,</p>
<p>fancy townhouses being built.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s continued in such a point that it&rsquo;s almost like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the movie by the South African director Nils Jody</p>
<p>Foster up in the space colony?</p>
<p>Matt Damon is the guy on the earth who has to go</p>
<p>up and anyway, it&rsquo;s about the stratification.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the great inequality that people</p>
<p>in the space station have like amazing medical auto docs</p>
<p>that can extend their life or save them cure cancer.</p>
<p>People on earth are all suffering ground down in poverty.</p>
<p>And that sort of happened while I was here.</p>
<p>You saw a lot of money drive prices up</p>
<p>along the narrow peninsula and the single people</p>
<p>wanted nightlife so they were in the city</p>
<p>and the condos in the city got super expensive.</p>
<p>And I know even Google friends who are socially responsible</p>
<p>say we should have more housing built.</p>
<p>We should have yes in my backyard, not in my backyard.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not happening as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>And from the government to the incumbent landowners</p>
<p>and renters, it&rsquo;s just not happening.</p>
<p>And that has to drive people away.</p>
<p>I appreciate that people come here and you should wait</p>
<p>for the prices to moderate, they will.</p>
<p>But a lot of people are gonna go where the prices are lower.</p>
<p>You, and sorry for silly questions here,</p>
<p>but just looking back, you have created things,</p>
<p>have been part of creating things</p>
<p>that have transformed this world, the world of technology,</p>
<p>perhaps more than almost anything else.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re still a human being</p>
<p>and unfortunately this ride ends.</p>
<p>Do you ever think about your own mortality?</p>
<p>Not too much, I mean, I&rsquo;m a Roman Catholic</p>
<p>so I am not afraid of death.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people who have problems with death</p>
<p>are suffering from some lack of either faith</p>
<p>in their transcending death or maybe they don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>children or they feel like they get later in life</p>
<p>and they feel like they&rsquo;ve missed opportunities</p>
<p>to do something that endures.</p>
<p>And I sympathize with a lot because I&rsquo;m old,</p>
<p>I got married fairly old, so I understand all that.</p>
<p>Nothing human is alien to me as Terrence said.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t fear it, no.</p>
<p>What do you hope your legacy is?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s gonna be JavaScript.</p>
<p>I think, no, I think my legacy has more to do</p>
<p>with my children and their children.</p>
<p>I think it also has to do with web standards,</p>
<p>it has to do with things like Brave,</p>
<p>the things we did with Firefox.</p>
<p>When we did, I&rsquo;m not gonna oversell Brave</p>
<p>but I think Brave is important and we&rsquo;ll continue</p>
<p>to prove this in a way that counts</p>
<p>for many decades to come.</p>
<p>But even Firefox, whatever its future fortune,</p>
<p>showed you can restart the browser market.</p>
<p>This thing you said about people opting out</p>
<p>and routing around, you don&rsquo;t need everybody to do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like Taleb&rsquo;s stubborn minorities that do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the lead users, Erfron Hipple&rsquo;s lead users.</p>
<p>You can be a few percent, you can tilt the market.</p>
<p>And that can be done in spite of the incumbents,</p>
<p>of moneyed interests not being in favor of what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So I think what we do with Firefox won&rsquo;t be forgotten</p>
<p>and it needs to be done more and we&rsquo;re doing it with Brave.</p>
<p>And you could argue that other projects are doing it.</p>
<p>In some ways, blockchain is doing it.</p>
<p>The Robinhood, take down the use of Robinhood</p>
<p>by the Wall Street Bets kids, similar.</p>
<p>So yeah, that kind of spirit endures.</p>
<p>And I think it, in some ways it&rsquo;s American, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not hard revolutionary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not trying to burn the past and destroy everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like we have these certain, let&rsquo;s say rights.</p>
<p>We have duties too.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some debate about which comes first</p>
<p>in American jurisprudence and the founding documents.</p>
<p>But as long as things are working,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be like pragmatic Americans,</p>
<p>like de Tocqueville described in his writings.</p>
<p>But if things get too out of whack for one reason or another,</p>
<p>too unequal, too oligarchic and abusive,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna start our rights.</p>
<p>And even a few of us can do it.</p>
<p>And even in the American Revolution,</p>
<p>it was the minority who fought and put their lives,</p>
<p>treasure and sacred honor at stake.</p>
<p>It was a bunch of people went to upper Canada,</p>
<p>I think it was called, Ontario.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the beautiful, I mean,</p>
<p>that is at the core where your work stands for</p>
<p>is that a few people can have the power</p>
<p>to transform society with just a few radical ideas,</p>
<p>with just a little bit of code, change the world.</p>
<p>Gotta do it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s empowering.</p>
<p>That is the American way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why this country is, I believe,</p>
<p>the greatest country on Earth.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not over, or Matt says it too much,</p>
<p>but I think some special things</p>
<p>have already happened in this country</p>
<p>and will continue to happen.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really exciting.</p>
<p>And that spirit can continue no matter who comes here.</p>
<p>They can adopt those folkways and that spirit.</p>
<p>Brandon, I can&rsquo;t tell you how much,</p>
<p>I was freaking out how much of an honor it is</p>
<p>to talk to you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an incredible human being.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of my favorite conversations ever.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for wasting all this time with me.</p>
<p>I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Oh, it seems like a breeze.</p>
<p>My pleasure.</p>
