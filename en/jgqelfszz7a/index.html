we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about the nine causes of lethargy now what is lethargy compared to fatigue well it&amp;rsquo;s fatigue with a twist it&amp;rsquo;s fatigued with decreased activity you&amp;rsquo;re kind of apathetic kind of depressed a little bit you&amp;rsquo;re lacking motivation you&amp;rsquo;re lacking creativity so that&amp;rsquo;s what lethargy is now there are nine different causes so let&amp;rsquo;s just kind of run run through the list number one sustain stress where you&amp;rsquo;re pushing your adrenals and pushing pushing pushing and of course not recovering along the way let&amp;rsquo;s say that you have three small children right and you&amp;rsquo;re working two jobs and you can&amp;rsquo;t sleep then you&amp;rsquo;re pushing yourself that&amp;rsquo;s called sustain stress number two over training so you start working out and you&amp;rsquo;re doing crossfit which is quite intense and you&amp;rsquo;re doing that every day you&amp;rsquo;re going to feel lethargy because you&amp;rsquo;re not going to give your body a chance to recover next one lack of sleep well that could come from sustained stress many weeks of not sleeping you are going to be lethargic number four let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;re studying right and you&amp;rsquo;re studying a technical subject and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of big words well if you keep pushing through these words without looking them up you are going to be very tired and lethargic this is why we have dictionaries all right number five excessive stimulants so you&amp;rsquo;re tired and you&amp;rsquo;re drinking red bull drinking coffee all day you will start feeling lethargic all right number six hidden infections now this can be either like epstein-barr virus which you had maybe a long time ago that&amp;rsquo;s being reactivated because you&amp;rsquo;re under sustained stress stress will reactivate viruses that have been in remission or dormant also you could have like a little cavitation underneath a tooth a tooth infection and that can create a lot of us inflammation fatigue even arthritis so any type of hidden infection even lyme disease that could actually be a situation where you&amp;rsquo;re lethargic all the time all right number seven emfs electromagnetic fields i&amp;rsquo;ve done different videos on this topic i&amp;rsquo;m going to do more but this thing right here if you&amp;rsquo;re like on your cell phone all day or you&amp;rsquo;re in for your computer all day with your headphones you are going to feel lethargic now i&amp;rsquo;m going to give you a lot of solutions for that all right number eight old injuries now i&amp;rsquo;ll come back to that in a bit number nine nutritional deficiencies will definitely cause you to be lethargic so these are all the potential causes but how do you really find out which one is behind your lethargy well you need to isolate number one where this lethargy is located is it in your head is it in your sinuses is it in the back of your neck is it in your front of your neck is it in your chest like where is this lethargy located that will give you clues so for example let&amp;rsquo;s say you had mono when you&amp;rsquo;re in high school which is epstein-barr virus and now it&amp;rsquo;s like years later and you feel a lot of heaviness and lethargy around your neck okay well some of that virus can get reactivated and so there are various things that you can do for that situation i put a link down below let&amp;rsquo;s say your lethargy is in your head okay and you had some head trauma well old injuries especially in the head can make you lethargic years later now i put a link down below of how to address head injuries one day i had a patient when i was in practice have this serious lethargy and insomnia for years and come to find out it all occurred after this car accident where this huge box you know fell off of a truck in front of her and fell on her head and so i did some work on her as far as i addressed this injury and i&amp;rsquo;m going to show you the technique in the link down below and when i was done doing this technique her whole face changed i said go look in the mirror she looked in the mirror she looked younger she actually looked like the sense of relief because old injuries tend to accumulate and apparently that injury still stuck in her skull and creating problems years later interesting connection but you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t normally connect the dots unless someone brought it up as a potential problem so let&amp;rsquo;s say for example this lethargy is like in your chest and maybe it all started after you had pneumonia or some lung infection again these are just clues to try to pull out what the potential problem is when did your lethargy start exactly and what did you do just before that that will also give you clues on what could be causing your lethargy for example let&amp;rsquo;s say you had you changed your diet and you went on a high carb diet and you created all these nutritional deficiencies well then we know that&amp;rsquo;s through cause i mean you just want to find out when it started and what might have triggered it that&amp;rsquo;s going to give you a lot of information and you&amp;rsquo;d be surprised how many doctors don&amp;rsquo;t ever ask that one question you can get a huge clue on what could be causing the problem because there&amp;rsquo;s always something that occurs right before you get a specific symptom and then what i would recommend is test out one theory at a time and see what it is so for example if it&amp;rsquo;s if you think it&amp;rsquo;s over training stop exercising for a week and see if your lethargy goes away let&amp;rsquo;s say there&amp;rsquo;s a hidden infection well you can take oregano oil garlic which can actually help your immune system and see if you feel better now this also brings up another point i&amp;rsquo;ve had patients come in and tell me they go to the doctor they&amp;rsquo;re given an antibiotic and they have all these positive benefits like energy and their arthritis goes away when they&amp;rsquo;re trying to handle some bacterial infection but all these other benefits come up because they had this other infection going on at the same time that was zapping their energy so in that case what&amp;rsquo;s the solution do you just keep taking antibiotics no you build up your immune system you take natural antibodies like oregano and garlic and clove and even thyme all these things can actually clear out infections not to mention going in on a long fast can do it as well so you just want to go down the list and start to rule things out emf electromagnetic fields let&amp;rsquo;s say you stay away from your computer for a couple days and oh my gosh you feel so much better because you change your environment so anyway these are some tips some things you can do and also uh some additional possible causes that you may have not have thought about and additionally some potential causes that maybe you weren&amp;rsquo;t aware of before you go if you have a question about a product or you&amp;rsquo;re new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you&amp;rsquo;re on keto and you need a debug because it&amp;rsquo;s not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the u."><title>The 9 Causes of Lethargy ｜ DrEricBergDC | SWIEST</title>

the nine causes of lethargy now what is  </p><p>lethargy compared to fatigue well it&rsquo;s 
fatigue with a twist it&rsquo;s fatigued with  </p><p>decreased activity you&rsquo;re kind of apathetic 
kind of depressed a little bit you&rsquo;re lacking  </p><p>motivation you&rsquo;re lacking creativity so that&rsquo;s 
what lethargy is now there are nine different  </p><p>causes so let&rsquo;s just kind of run run through 
the list number one sustain stress where  </p><p>you&rsquo;re pushing your adrenals and pushing pushing 
pushing and of course not recovering along the way  </p><p>let&rsquo;s say that you have three small children right 
and you&rsquo;re working two jobs and you can&rsquo;t sleep  </p><p>then you&rsquo;re pushing yourself that&rsquo;s called 
sustain stress number two over training so  </p><p>you start working out and you&rsquo;re doing crossfit 
which is quite intense and you&rsquo;re doing that every  </p><p>day you&rsquo;re going to feel lethargy because you&rsquo;re 
not going to give your body a chance to recover  </p><p>next one lack of sleep well that 
could come from sustained stress  </p><p>many weeks of not sleeping you are going to be 
lethargic number four let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re studying  </p><p>right and you&rsquo;re studying a technical 
subject and there&rsquo;s a lot of big words  </p><p>well if you keep pushing through these words 
without looking them up you are going to be  </p><p>very tired and lethargic this is why we have 
dictionaries all right number five excessive  </p><p>stimulants so you&rsquo;re tired and you&rsquo;re 
drinking red bull drinking coffee all day  </p><p>you will start feeling lethargic all right number 
six hidden infections now this can be either like  </p><p>epstein-barr virus which you had maybe a long 
time ago that&rsquo;s being reactivated because you&rsquo;re  </p><p>under sustained stress stress will reactivate 
viruses that have been in remission or dormant  </p><p>also you could have like a little cavitation 
underneath a tooth a tooth infection and that  </p><p>can create a lot of us inflammation fatigue 
even arthritis so any type of hidden infection  </p><p>even lyme disease that could actually be a 
situation where you&rsquo;re lethargic all the time  </p><p>all right number seven emfs electromagnetic fields 
i&rsquo;ve done different videos on this topic i&rsquo;m going  </p><p>to do more but this thing right here if you&rsquo;re 
like on your cell phone all day or you&rsquo;re in for  </p><p>your computer all day with your headphones you are 
going to feel lethargic now i&rsquo;m going to give you  </p><p>a lot of solutions for that all right number eight 
old injuries now i&rsquo;ll come back to that in a bit  </p><p>number nine nutritional deficiencies will 
definitely cause you to be lethargic so  </p><p>these are all the potential causes but how do 
you really find out which one is behind your  </p><p>lethargy well you need to isolate number one 
where this lethargy is located is it in your head  </p><p>is it in your sinuses is 
it in the back of your neck  </p><p>is it in your front of your neck is it in 
your chest like where is this lethargy located  </p><p>that will give you clues so for example let&rsquo;s 
say you had mono when you&rsquo;re in high school  </p><p>which is epstein-barr virus and now it&rsquo;s like 
years later and you feel a lot of heaviness  </p><p>and lethargy around your neck okay well some of 
that virus can get reactivated and so there are  </p><p>various things that you can do for that situation 
i put a link down below let&rsquo;s say your lethargy  </p><p>is in your head okay and you had some head 
trauma well old injuries especially in the head  </p><p>can make you lethargic years later now i 
put a link down below of how to address head  </p><p>injuries one day i had a patient when i was in 
practice have this serious lethargy and insomnia  </p><p>for years and come to find out it all occurred 
after this car accident where this huge box  </p><p>you know fell off of a truck in front of her and 
fell on her head and so i did some work on her  </p><p>as far as i addressed this injury and i&rsquo;m going 
to show you the technique in the link down below  </p><p>and when i was done doing this technique her 
whole face changed i said go look in the mirror  </p><p>she looked in the mirror she looked younger 
she actually looked like the sense of relief  </p><p>because old injuries tend to accumulate and 
apparently that injury still stuck in her skull  </p><p>and creating problems years later interesting 
connection but you wouldn&rsquo;t normally connect the  </p><p>dots unless someone brought it up as a potential 
problem so let&rsquo;s say for example this lethargy  </p><p>is like in your chest and maybe it all started 
after you had pneumonia or some lung infection  </p><p>again these are just clues to try to pull 
out what the potential problem is when did  </p><p>your lethargy start exactly and what did you do 
just before that that will also give you clues on  </p><p>what could be causing your lethargy for example 
let&rsquo;s say you had you changed your diet and you  </p><p>went on a high carb diet and you created all these 
nutritional deficiencies well then we know that&rsquo;s  </p><p>through cause i mean you just want to find out 
when it started and what might have triggered it  </p><p>that&rsquo;s going to give you a lot of information 
and you&rsquo;d be surprised how many doctors don&rsquo;t  </p><p>ever ask that one question you can get a huge 
clue on what could be causing the problem  </p><p>because there&rsquo;s always something that occurs 
right before you get a specific symptom  </p><p>and then what i would recommend is test out one 
theory at a time and see what it is so for example  </p><p>if it&rsquo;s if you think it&rsquo;s over training stop 
exercising for a week and see if your lethargy  </p><p>goes away let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s a hidden infection 
well you can take oregano oil garlic which can  </p><p>actually help your immune system and see if you 
feel better now this also brings up another point  </p><p>i&rsquo;ve had patients come in and tell me they 
go to the doctor they&rsquo;re given an antibiotic  </p><p>and they have all these positive benefits 
like energy and their arthritis goes away  </p><p>when they&rsquo;re trying to handle some bacterial 
infection but all these other benefits come up  </p><p>because they had this other infection going on 
at the same time that was zapping their energy  </p><p>so in that case what&rsquo;s the solution do you just 
keep taking antibiotics no you build up your  </p><p>immune system you take natural antibodies like 
oregano and garlic and clove and even thyme all  </p><p>these things can actually clear out infections 
not to mention going in on a long fast can do  </p><p>it as well so you just want to go down the list 
and start to rule things out emf electromagnetic  </p><p>fields let&rsquo;s say you stay away from your computer 
for a couple days and oh my gosh you feel so much  </p><p>better because you change your environment so 
anyway these are some tips some things you can do  </p><p>and also uh some additional possible causes 
that you may have not have thought about  </p><p>and additionally some potential causes that maybe 
you weren&rsquo;t aware of before you go if you have a  </p><p>question about a product or you&rsquo;re new to keto and 
you want to know how to begin keto or you&rsquo;re on  </p><p>keto and you need a debug because it&rsquo;s not going 
as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by  </p><p>to help you this is just for the people in 
the u.s. hopefully in the future we&rsquo;ll be able  </p><p>to answer everyone&rsquo;s call but i put the number 
down below so you can call and get some help you</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
