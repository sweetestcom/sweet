    <p>The following is a conversation with Ray Dalio,</p>
<p>his second time on the podcast.</p>
<p>He is a legendary investor,</p>
<p>founder of Bridgewater Associates,</p>
<p>author of a book I highly recommend called Principles,</p>
<p>and also a new book called Principles for Dealing</p>
<p>with a Changing World Order,</p>
<p>that looks at the geopolitics of today,</p>
<p>especially US and China, through the lens of history,</p>
<p>providing a fascinating model</p>
<p>for the rise and fall of empires</p>
<p>that can be applied to the analysis of our world today.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Ray Dalio.</p>
<p>When you look at the history of the world,</p>
<p>as you have done in your new book,</p>
<p>Principles of Dealing with a Changing World Order,</p>
<p>what is more important, more impactful, money or power?</p>
<p>They go hand in hand.</p>
<p>They support each other and they compete with each other.</p>
<p>Those who have money have power, a certain type of power.</p>
<p>That power has to do with all that they can buy,</p>
<p>but it also has the ability</p>
<p>to influence those with political power.</p>
<p>And so you see this throughout history,</p>
<p>this symbiotic relationship.</p>
<p>You know, for example, between the royal families,</p>
<p>the nobility, and the church.</p>
<p>So you see that group of people</p>
<p>supporting each other in various ways,</p>
<p>and then wrestling around with each other</p>
<p>for the money and power among that group.</p>
<p>So the dynamic that&rsquo;s quite classic</p>
<p>is you could look at the parties in power</p>
<p>back in the 16th, 17th centuries.</p>
<p>You would look at royal families, nobles,</p>
<p>and the church, if you&rsquo;re in Europe,</p>
<p>and then you would look at agricultural land,</p>
<p>and there was a certain dynamic.</p>
<p>And that varies over time, it changes,</p>
<p>as those people get thrown out and technology changes.</p>
<p>So when we evolved, when the society evolved,</p>
<p>so that it would produce goods and services,</p>
<p>and you have something like the Industrial Revolution,</p>
<p>the first Industrial Revolution, you have machines,</p>
<p>and you have the talent of people that are off the farms,</p>
<p>and then you have a struggling for power.</p>
<p>You see that power mix change.</p>
<p>And so we don&rsquo;t see that same power mix anymore,</p>
<p>but you still see the same dynamic.</p>
<p>You see those with money,</p>
<p>dealing with those who have political power</p>
<p>around those assets that are considered most valuable</p>
<p>to particularly the productive assets that produce money.</p>
<p>And political power is usually centered around nation state,</p>
<p>so the major locus of power is the nations.</p>
<p>Yes, in 1668, after 30 years of war,</p>
<p>there was the development of nation states.</p>
<p>Before then, it was really the development of countries</p>
<p>as we know it, that there were borders,</p>
<p>and that within those borders,</p>
<p>those who had control got to control it,</p>
<p>and there were not to be intrusions in those borders,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how we established the nation state.</p>
<p>And then, of course, within each country, there is levels.</p>
<p>There is a central level,</p>
<p>and then there is typically a province</p>
<p>or state level down below,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a municipal level,</p>
<p>so they each have different levels of power,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the coordination of those</p>
<p>that determines how the country is run.</p>
<p>You write that the, quote, archetypal big cycle</p>
<p>governs the rising and declining empires</p>
<p>and influences everything about them,</p>
<p>including their currencies and markets.</p>
<p>The most important three cycles</p>
<p>are the ones you mention in the introduction,</p>
<p>the long term debt and capital market cycle,</p>
<p>the internal order and disorder cycle,</p>
<p>and the external order and disorder cycle.</p>
<p>Can you describe this big cycle?</p>
<p>There are two orders.</p>
<p>There is an order, by order I mean a system,</p>
<p>how the system works.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an internal order,</p>
<p>that is the internal governance system,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s usually set out in a constitution</p>
<p>or some agreements, and then there&rsquo;s the world order,</p>
<p>how the world system.</p>
<p>So for example, in 1945, at the end of a war,</p>
<p>which is basically a fight for determining the world order,</p>
<p>the winners of the fight got together</p>
<p>and created the world system as we now know it.</p>
<p>In 1944, they created the Bretton Woods Monetary System</p>
<p>that determined the money, pretty much,</p>
<p>and because the United States won</p>
<p>and had 80% of the world&rsquo;s money,</p>
<p>gold was money then, and it had 80% of the world&rsquo;s gold,</p>
<p>and it was half the world&rsquo;s economy,</p>
<p>and it was the great military power,</p>
<p>the order was built around an American world order,</p>
<p>so that the United Nations was in New York,</p>
<p>the World Bank and the IMF were in Washington,</p>
<p>and they built that new order.</p>
<p>So classically, you have a war</p>
<p>to determine whose rules we&rsquo;re following,</p>
<p>and then you have the new order being constructed.</p>
<p>After that, there is usually period</p>
<p>of extended peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>Peace suits prosperity, and so there&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>and the reason you have the peace</p>
<p>is because no one wants to fight with the dominant power.</p>
<p>You know you&rsquo;re gonna lose, you&rsquo;ve surrendered.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been the surrendering.</p>
<p>They carve up the world,</p>
<p>they say what it&rsquo;s gonna look like,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s gonna control what,</p>
<p>and then you come into that period of peace,</p>
<p>and then prosperity, where then there&rsquo;s a working together.</p>
<p>Usually, at that point, you&rsquo;ve wiped out a lot of the debt,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve wiped out a lot of the issues,</p>
<p>the class warfare and so on,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s good working together.</p>
<p>So those great periods,</p>
<p>such as the Industrial Revolution in the late 1800s,</p>
<p>or what we&rsquo;ve experienced in the post World War II period,</p>
<p>are peaceful and prosperous periods</p>
<p>led largely by the dominant world power.</p>
<p>Over a period of time, since really 1500,</p>
<p>and maybe before, but really 1500,</p>
<p>when the Dutch invented capitalism,</p>
<p>and what I mean by that,</p>
<p>they invented the first capital markets,</p>
<p>the first stocks and the first stock market,</p>
<p>that since then, capitalism has been an effective tool</p>
<p>for building wealth because it got resources</p>
<p>into the hands of inventive people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when we moved from agriculture</p>
<p>to the importance of inventiveness of people,</p>
<p>they got resources, and then they built that prosperity.</p>
<p>In that process of doing that,</p>
<p>they create wealth gaps, naturally.</p>
<p>Those who make a lot of money make a lot more</p>
<p>than those that don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and it also produces opportunity gaps</p>
<p>because, for example,</p>
<p>those who earn a lot of money have that wealth,</p>
<p>they have the power to educate their children</p>
<p>in a way that others don&rsquo;t, and the gaps grow.</p>
<p>And also, the debts grow at that time.</p>
<p>When they go around the world with their competitiveness,</p>
<p>they earn a lot of money.</p>
<p>So for example, the Dutch, the Dutch Empire,</p>
<p>learned how to build ships that would go around the world.</p>
<p>A key ingredient of this improvement in this cycle</p>
<p>is the improvement of education,</p>
<p>and by education I mean the skills that come from education,</p>
<p>but also civility, the ability to deal well together.</p>
<p>So the Dutch invented ships that could go around the world</p>
<p>and they had military power,</p>
<p>but they were also a very inventive society.</p>
<p>25% of the world&rsquo;s new inventions came from the Dutch,</p>
<p>and so as they went around the world,</p>
<p>they also brought their currency,</p>
<p>and they brought their military.</p>
<p>They needed the currency, they paid for things,</p>
<p>and that currency, and then the more that happens,</p>
<p>the more that becomes a reserve currency,</p>
<p>and then they have their military,</p>
<p>so they need their military strength,</p>
<p>and so you see it evolve in all of those ways.</p>
<p>But over a period of time,</p>
<p>as they become more successful and more expensive,</p>
<p>they become more expensive,</p>
<p>and newer countries come along,</p>
<p>like the UK, then learn to build ships from a lot the Dutch</p>
<p>and could do that less expensively,</p>
<p>and also when they become more expensive,</p>
<p>so less competitive,</p>
<p>and also the work ethic begins to change.</p>
<p>They believe that since they&rsquo;re richer,</p>
<p>they can enjoy life more.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to work quite as hard,</p>
<p>and so you start to see the tilt.</p>
<p>Now you start to see the development of the top,</p>
<p>and when you have a world reserve currency,</p>
<p>that allows you to borrow a lot of money</p>
<p>because those who want to save want to hold your money,</p>
<p>and that means that they&rsquo;ll lend you money,</p>
<p>and so those countries get deeper into debt.</p>
<p>So you see that they gradually lose their competitiveness,</p>
<p>and they get themselves into financial circumstances,</p>
<p>which are not good,</p>
<p>and they have large wealth gaps,</p>
<p>which set the stage for downturns.</p>
<p>And when they have downturns,</p>
<p>the first question is do they have enough money?</p>
<p>And traditionally, money is resources.</p>
<p>So you classically see that the coffers are bare,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re spending more money than they are earning,</p>
<p>and they run out of money in the coffers,</p>
<p>and their granaries are empty rather than stocked</p>
<p>so that they give them the buffer.</p>
<p>And as that deteriorates, that worsens conditions.</p>
<p>And if they have a rival power that&rsquo;s also challenging them,</p>
<p>they see greater internal conflict over wealth,</p>
<p>and then they have the problems internally</p>
<p>and the problems externally,</p>
<p>which usually results in an internal war or an external war</p>
<p>that leads to the change to the new world order.</p>
<p>And to you, the Dutch Empire is a good example of that.</p>
<p>The British, what are some of the key examples</p>
<p>that you think about in the book</p>
<p>of this process that followed the big cycle?</p>
<p>Well, the leading reserve currency empires,</p>
<p>but it applies to all the empires,</p>
<p>were the Dutch, the British, the American, and the Chinese.</p>
<p>But you could follow the same pattern.</p>
<p>In the book, it was very important for me</p>
<p>to not just use words and concepts</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s subjective.</p>
<p>It was very important for me to use actual measurements.</p>
<p>So as you see in the book, you can see every level of this.</p>
<p>You can see where&rsquo;s the education level,</p>
<p>what is the military power, each one of those,</p>
<p>and you could see them back going over the 500 years.</p>
<p>And so you could see the arcs and the composition</p>
<p>of those arcs, and what you see is really,</p>
<p>in most countries and most dynasties, you could see that.</p>
<p>But you also can see through those numbers</p>
<p>the health of those countries.</p>
<p>Today, there are statistics that are in the book</p>
<p>that show what is the level of education,</p>
<p>what is the level of economic output,</p>
<p>what is the level of military strength,</p>
<p>what is the level of a number of different measures</p>
<p>of strength, so that you can then compare that.</p>
<p>And I think that because they&rsquo;re objective measures</p>
<p>of strength that you could see change,</p>
<p>that shows the picture of where we are today.</p>
<p>And I think one of the most important things about the book</p>
<p>is that it allows people to monitor</p>
<p>how those things are transpiring.</p>
<p>I think for policymakers,</p>
<p>are your policymakers doing a good job?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so much subjectivity in that.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s very simple.</p>
<p>If those lines on the chart are improving,</p>
<p>if your health index is improving,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re moving toward a better life.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what the book works like.</p>
<p>Also, it was used to create a model for the future.</p>
<p>In other words, there are cause effect relationships.</p>
<p>Everything that happens has reasons, causes,</p>
<p>that preceded it, that made it happen.</p>
<p>And so by having all those in numbers,</p>
<p>one can see the probabilities of certain things happening.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what you see in the book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just Ray&rsquo;s interpretation.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t wanna make it Ray&rsquo;s interpretation</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m right.</p>
<p>Yeah, so one of the fascinating things in the book,</p>
<p>so you have list these 18 measures,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s like a little scorecard</p>
<p>for the countries of the world today.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say US, China, and Europe,</p>
<p>and what it was 20 years ago,</p>
<p>and looking at the change from 20 years ago,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s another indicator, the change itself,</p>
<p>to see where things are headed.</p>
<p>Maybe can you comment on, from a score perspective,</p>
<p>how is US and China doing?</p>
<p>And in the 18 measures, what are some measures</p>
<p>that stand out to you as particularly important</p>
<p>to think about today for the United States, for China?</p>
<p>Well, there are a number.</p>
<p>Financially, what you see in the United States</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;re borrowing a lot more money,</p>
<p>creating a lot of debt, and we&rsquo;re printing a lot of money.</p>
<p>And our capacity to do that is very much,</p>
<p>is limited, first of all,</p>
<p>because when there&rsquo;s a sale of a bond,</p>
<p>when the government borrows more than it borrows money,</p>
<p>because it spends more than it takes in,</p>
<p>you have to sell a bond.</p>
<p>And the world right now</p>
<p>has a lot of US dollar denominated bonds,</p>
<p>because as the world&rsquo;s reserve currency,</p>
<p>they sell, sold on them.</p>
<p>And they have very bad returns, negative real returns,</p>
<p>negative real returns significantly, and so on.</p>
<p>So that means that more bonds</p>
<p>has to be sold than are bought.</p>
<p>And that means that the Federal Reserve</p>
<p>is faced with the choice of having to raise</p>
<p>the interest rate to curtail borrowing,</p>
<p>which slows the economy and hurts the markets,</p>
<p>or by filling that difference and producing money,</p>
<p>the debt monetization, which produces an inflation</p>
<p>in goods, services, and financial assets.</p>
<p>So in that regard, that&rsquo;s the United States&rsquo;s position.</p>
<p>In China&rsquo;s case, its balance of payments is better.</p>
<p>China has displaced the United States</p>
<p>as the world&rsquo;s largest trading country.</p>
<p>In other words, more exports to other countries.</p>
<p>And as a result, it&rsquo;s economically competitive,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t have the world&rsquo;s reserve currency.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a real blessing.</p>
<p>So the United States, it has the world&rsquo;s reserve currency,</p>
<p>but it is risking it because of this imbalance.</p>
<p>So if you look at history,</p>
<p>you see that those go slowly,</p>
<p>but when they go eventually, they go quickly.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a risk of that financially.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the issue of internal order.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just giving you the major ones,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll get into some of the other ones too.</p>
<p>Right now, there&rsquo;s a lot of internal conflict</p>
<p>in the United States, which affects</p>
<p>how well it works.</p>
<p>In China, there&rsquo;s less internal conflict</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a more autocratic state,</p>
<p>but also they&rsquo;ve created this bifurcation</p>
<p>of what is political and what is economic</p>
<p>in terms of producing that prosperity.</p>
<p>So if you stay out of the politics pretty much,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re seeing entrepreneurship,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re seeing the finances of new businesses and so on.</p>
<p>And so that internal working,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s subject to different people&rsquo;s interpretations</p>
<p>whether they like it or not,</p>
<p>but the internal conflict in terms of those kinds</p>
<p>of measures is less.</p>
<p>Sorry to pause on that for a second.</p>
<p>So these measures, I guess you don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to sort of romanticize any one measure</p>
<p>or something like that, overinterpret any one measure,</p>
<p>but is internal conflict always a bad thing?</p>
<p>Is it a complicated calculation?</p>
<p>Or do you kind of, the way we think</p>
<p>about these measures that you&rsquo;ve presented,</p>
<p>we should be thinking like the higher, the better,</p>
<p>the lower, the worse, I mean, of course,</p>
<p>depending on the measure.</p>
<p>Well, in many cases, the conflict that produces</p>
<p>the revolution produces revolutionary changes</p>
<p>that lead to resolutions and lead to new starts.</p>
<p>And so a short term civil war is a hellacious experience.</p>
<p>And at the same time, it can be the transition</p>
<p>to a new beginning.</p>
<p>Also, there are different types of conflict.</p>
<p>Competition, which makes things, makes everything better,</p>
<p>is a productive conflict, whereas destructive conflicts</p>
<p>are not good over the short time.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how those go.</p>
<p>So within each measure, the story is complicated.</p>
<p>Yeah, but my measures are sort of clear,</p>
<p>meaning how much political conflict,</p>
<p>how much social conflict.</p>
<p>In other words, you can measure conflict,</p>
<p>you can measure fighting, you can measure crime rates,</p>
<p>you can measure lots of different ways of conflict.</p>
<p>So the measures are a composite of different types</p>
<p>of internal conflict.</p>
<p>What are some other interesting measures,</p>
<p>maybe if you can also mention that,</p>
<p>for me in particular, interest is education and innovation.</p>
<p>Yes, the classic cycle, the most important leading indicator</p>
<p>is the quality of education.</p>
<p>Most importantly, broad based education</p>
<p>drawn from the largest population</p>
<p>because you can never tell who the talent is going to be.</p>
<p>So where are they gonna come from?</p>
<p>So for example, if you look at the Chinese dynasties,</p>
<p>the great Chinese dynasties and the Confucian approach,</p>
<p>it was meritocratic of everybody could sit for exams</p>
<p>and so on broad base of drawing in the populations.</p>
<p>And you see that if you go across societies</p>
<p>because that draws on the largest number of population</p>
<p>to get education.</p>
<p>And it also, that creates a reality and a perception</p>
<p>that the system is fair, equal opportunity,</p>
<p>not just one of privilege.</p>
<p>And that helps to create social stability.</p>
<p>But education is not just education in understanding facts</p>
<p>and so on, it is education in civility</p>
<p>of how to behave together.</p>
<p>And so if they&rsquo;re smart,</p>
<p>they understand how to be productive</p>
<p>because they work well together and they&rsquo;re productive.</p>
<p>And then that leads to the next stage.</p>
<p>You could see in the lines in the charts, I plotted these</p>
<p>so that you could see in a typical cycle,</p>
<p>you could see that education is the long leading indicator.</p>
<p>And then you could see, as you mentioned,</p>
<p>that what you see is inventiveness and technology measures</p>
<p>then follow and you see then also competitiveness</p>
<p>and world markets follows.</p>
<p>For example, in the early stages of a cycle,</p>
<p>the industries that they go into tend to be very basic</p>
<p>industry because they have cheap labor,</p>
<p>something like textiles and simple manufactured goods</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>But as the education rises,</p>
<p>then they move up the value chain to greater technologies</p>
<p>and so on, which raises incomes and raises productivity.</p>
<p>So yes, those and as you say,</p>
<p>there are 18 different measures like that,</p>
<p>but education and then civility and the inventiveness.</p>
<p>So you see it reflected in who&rsquo;s inventing what.</p>
<p>And that corresponds then who&rsquo;s trading with,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a big trading country</p>
<p>and where&rsquo;s the value of economic output</p>
<p>and what are per capita incomes.</p>
<p>They all follow those arcs.</p>
<p>Yeah, like you said, the fascinating thing about your book,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s philosophy, there&rsquo;s wisdom, but there&rsquo;s plots.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can see it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just your opinion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like you can interpret it in any way you like,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re just giving a lot of your own insights</p>
<p>along with the numbers.</p>
<p>If you were to look at the American nation,</p>
<p>the American empire and the trajectories</p>
<p>looking into the future given these measures,</p>
<p>what is the trajectory that leads to the collapse</p>
<p>of the American empire based on these measures?</p>
<p>What are the concerning indicators</p>
<p>and if those break down further, what does that look like?</p>
<p>Well, all of those indicators are concerning,</p>
<p>maybe except for one, which is technology,</p>
<p>the technology niche, although even in that area,</p>
<p>the United States is improving at a slower rate</p>
<p>than is China for various advantages that they have there.</p>
<p>They put out about eight times as many computer engineers</p>
<p>they have free data and so on, but if you look at them,</p>
<p>so the financial is a concern.</p>
<p>The internal order, disorder is a concern.</p>
<p>Then if you look at education levels,</p>
<p>the United States is in many ways</p>
<p>is losing its educational advantage.</p>
<p>If you were to look at, compare it with China,</p>
<p>if you take general public education in the United States,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s deteriorated tremendously</p>
<p>even in comparison to developed countries.</p>
<p>There are scores, PISA scores and so on,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s something like 38th in the world or something</p>
<p>and that was a big plunge, average public education.</p>
<p>If you look at the best universities in the world,</p>
<p>the United States is unique</p>
<p>in having the best universities in the world,</p>
<p>so there are these privileged universities</p>
<p>in the world, so there are these privileged spots</p>
<p>that are, you know, excellent, uniquely excellent.</p>
<p>So when you look at the comparison,</p>
<p>education in China is improving rapidly</p>
<p>and the quantity is a quantity of educated people</p>
<p>in the areas that they&rsquo;re moving in is greater</p>
<p>and the resources that they&rsquo;re putting behind it is greater</p>
<p>and so you see the results are greater,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s sort of along the lines that I&rsquo;m dealing with.</p>
<p>If you were to follow through</p>
<p>in terms of actual productions,</p>
<p>I think you know in terms of technologies,</p>
<p>there are some areas that the United States is in a lead</p>
<p>at the moment, there&rsquo;s some areas that China&rsquo;s in a lead,</p>
<p>but China&rsquo;s gaining very quickly.</p>
<p>When I first went to China, 1984,</p>
<p>I would bring $10 calculators</p>
<p>and I gave them away as gifts to high ranking people</p>
<p>and they thought they were miracle devices.</p>
<p>Right now, in terms of areas like quantum computing</p>
<p>and AI and you know, many areas,</p>
<p>you have a race going on</p>
<p>and so if you take the trajectory of the competitiveness,</p>
<p>not just look at the current level,</p>
<p>you have a situation where they&rsquo;re improving</p>
<p>at a much faster rate.</p>
<p>This is all good for the world if the world can get along.</p>
<p>And the main thing I think is,</p>
<p>how do you have a healthy world</p>
<p>and how do you have a strong economy</p>
<p>and how do you have a strong situation is be strong.</p>
<p>The United States is war is with itself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the main war.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s very simple in history.</p>
<p>Be financially sound, earn more than you spend</p>
<p>and be strong in these ways</p>
<p>and pretty much everything will take care of itself.</p>
<p>But you make it sound simple of course</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a momentum when things degrade,</p>
<p>when the education system degrades,</p>
<p>when you start borrowing,</p>
<p>when I mean, all of these indicators,</p>
<p>once they&rsquo;re going down, there&rsquo;s a momentum to it, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard to reverse it.</p>
<p>Right and there are circumstances that you&rsquo;re then in.</p>
<p>For example, indebtedness.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s politically desirable</p>
<p>for those to borrow money and spend</p>
<p>because their constituencies only look at what they get</p>
<p>and when they get a lot, they don&rsquo;t pay attention</p>
<p>to the balance sheet and how much debt is on the books.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s always better to borrow, spend</p>
<p>and then leave the cleanup to the next guy.</p>
<p>And so you inherit a lot.</p>
<p>You inherit it as a new president enters in</p>
<p>or new legislators, they have a lot of debt,</p>
<p>they have a broken down infrastructure,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have enough money to fix that.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the lay of the land</p>
<p>that the prior generations put you in</p>
<p>and there you are.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult because when you start to think,</p>
<p>okay, what&rsquo;s healthy?</p>
<p>Well, earn more than you spend.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s not so easy</p>
<p>because you know, what does that mean?</p>
<p>Go earn more?</p>
<p>I mean, okay, that&rsquo;s not so easy.</p>
<p>Spend less?</p>
<p>That isn&rsquo;t gonna work.</p>
<p>So now what do you do?</p>
<p>Okay, you have this debt that you then monetize</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s classic.</p>
<p>So yes, that&rsquo;s why these cycles occur</p>
<p>because what has created before,</p>
<p>what happened before created the lay of the land</p>
<p>that is then increasingly difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>So what can great leaders do in this moment?</p>
<p>I mean, maybe my sense is leadership is crucial here.</p>
<p>So for example, to do very large projects</p>
<p>and invest in the education system</p>
<p>that sort of try to fix the fundamentals</p>
<p>or maybe invest more and more into the innovation</p>
<p>and the development of new technologies and so on.</p>
<p>It feels like that just doesn&rsquo;t happen organically.</p>
<p>So you have to have strong leaders</p>
<p>that convince the populace</p>
<p>of the importance of these ideas.</p>
<p>Well, I completely agree with your list.</p>
<p>What we have is a situation</p>
<p>where everybody has their opinions</p>
<p>and they have to sort of get them exactly right</p>
<p>and they all fight with each other</p>
<p>about whether their opinions.</p>
<p>So the most important thing is that we become bipartisan</p>
<p>so that we don&rsquo;t and we get over our differences.</p>
<p>I would have a bipartisan cabinet.</p>
<p>I would draw upon both members of both parties,</p>
<p>the moderates who are going to be able to work together.</p>
<p>So as then we have one country</p>
<p>and then we deal with those in a means</p>
<p>that works for the majority of the people in the middle</p>
<p>rather than the polarity.</p>
<p>I think our greatest risk is in not being able to do that.</p>
<p>So I would say that&rsquo;s a paramount importance</p>
<p>because we have the resources,</p>
<p>wealth, real wealth and science</p>
<p>and everything has never been better than it is.</p>
<p>But the notion is that it has to work</p>
<p>for the majority of people</p>
<p>and we have to keep it being productive.</p>
<p>So that group has got to calmly and knowledgeably</p>
<p>work together so that they increase the size of the pie</p>
<p>and they create broad based prosperity.</p>
<p>So that is a paramount importance.</p>
<p>Whatever they do, if they do it that way,</p>
<p>I can say I&rsquo;m happy about</p>
<p>because that other alternative</p>
<p>is the really scary alternative.</p>
<p>The scary alternative,</p>
<p>the different ways it has evolved throughout history,</p>
<p>some of it has led to wars.</p>
<p>What are the future trajectories</p>
<p>that lead to a potential war with China?</p>
<p>Cold war or hot war?</p>
<p>Is this something you think about?</p>
<p>Is this something you&rsquo;re worried about?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;d like to talk about both wars.</p>
<p>So the war with China, as I say,</p>
<p>there are five kinds of wars.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a trade war, technology war, geopolitical influence</p>
<p>war, capital war, and military war.</p>
<p>As far as military war goes,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s only a Taiwan issue, but that&rsquo;s a big issue.</p>
<p>And we could talk about that for a minute,</p>
<p>but those others, they&rsquo;ll be rough competitions</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll have that type of evolution over a period of time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what that war looks like.</p>
<p>Taiwan has been, for a long time,</p>
<p>a sovereignty issue to China.</p>
<p>And it has its roots</p>
<p>in what&rsquo;s called the 100 years of humiliation.</p>
<p>From the 1840s to 1949, foreign powers came in,</p>
<p>took advantage of China, they had the opium wars</p>
<p>and such times, and that represented</p>
<p>the 100 years of humiliation.</p>
<p>And Taiwan represents their sovereignty</p>
<p>and their important thing.</p>
<p>And 50 years ago, starting 50 years ago,</p>
<p>there was an agreement that there is one China</p>
<p>and Taiwan is part of China.</p>
<p>And that there would be peaceful reunification.</p>
<p>The peaceful reunification hasn&rsquo;t happened.</p>
<p>And in their view, that&rsquo;s a very big issue.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a big contentious issue.</p>
<p>And that could produce a military war,</p>
<p>could produce a military accident,</p>
<p>could produce, it&rsquo;s a very tense situation.</p>
<p>And if we had a military war, God help us</p>
<p>because of the capacity in all different new ways</p>
<p>to inflict harm on each other.</p>
<p>But anyway, that&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have that military war,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have the competition between those other kinds of wars</p>
<p>and whoever is strongest in those areas will win.</p>
<p>Where do you put cyber war within the five?</p>
<p>Well, cyber war is a military war.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming the type of cyber war that you&rsquo;re referring to</p>
<p>is that which is used to inflict pain</p>
<p>on the other party through cyber.</p>
<p>So cyber wars, you&rsquo;ll see cyber war.</p>
<p>You could see space war.</p>
<p>You can see drone warfare.</p>
<p>New types of warfare, not just the traditional</p>
<p>and nuclear type of warfare.</p>
<p>But you could see any of the above.</p>
<p>What are the defining characteristics?</p>
<p>What are the interesting things about Xi Jinping,</p>
<p>the president of China, as a leader on the world stage?</p>
<p>His father was a early leader.</p>
<p>He was himself in the Cultural Revolution in times,</p>
<p>treated brutally.</p>
<p>And during that period of time, it was very, very difficult.</p>
<p>And he came up through the ranks</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a very intelligent man.</p>
<p>When he first came to power,</p>
<p>as you know, they have two five year terms,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re now coming to the end</p>
<p>of the second of those five year terms.</p>
<p>When he first came to power,</p>
<p>he felt that there should be a lot of reform.</p>
<p>And reform meant moving to much more</p>
<p>of a market and open economy.</p>
<p>When that happened, him coming in,</p>
<p>I had some contact with economic policymakers,</p>
<p>but in the circumstances then,</p>
<p>were that five major banks lent to state owned enterprises</p>
<p>and local governments with implied government guarantees.</p>
<p>And so there was not control of that</p>
<p>and the movement to aim more of a market economy.</p>
<p>And the development of markets was a primary</p>
<p>and also the dealing with the corruption issue.</p>
<p>There was a lot of corruption prior to that,</p>
<p>and that was viewed as an existential threat to the system.</p>
<p>So that became the primary objective.</p>
<p>And then as time progressed over those 10 years,</p>
<p>there was a lot of changing in the world,</p>
<p>their financial circumstances,</p>
<p>opening many, many other markets.</p>
<p>They particularly getting money</p>
<p>to small and medium sized enterprises</p>
<p>and developing a lending system</p>
<p>and then establishing controls on it.</p>
<p>So right now there&rsquo;s a vibrant capital markets.</p>
<p>You can raise capital, you can be an entrepreneur,</p>
<p>you can become a billionaire in the capital markets.</p>
<p>And they developed the markets</p>
<p>to be the second largest capital markets.</p>
<p>At the same time, they had to deal</p>
<p>with their rising debt issue,</p>
<p>which they began to deal with really about four years ago,</p>
<p>when the second largest capital markets</p>
<p>were about four years ago, when the second term began.</p>
<p>And then Lu He became the vice premier</p>
<p>responsible for that and to deal with those issues.</p>
<p>So you see right now that what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>is the dealing with the real estate bubble.</p>
<p>There was a development in real estate, a bubble,</p>
<p>which produced a lot of unproductive lending.</p>
<p>And Xi Jinping said, houses are meant to live in,</p>
<p>not to speculate on.</p>
<p>And so that was wasteful.</p>
<p>So they established what they call three red lines,</p>
<p>which are financial ratios,</p>
<p>that the property developers had to live within.</p>
<p>And that is then causing the adjustments</p>
<p>that are going on now, which in my view are very healthy</p>
<p>because whenever there&rsquo;s bankruptcies</p>
<p>and so on, most in the public think, okay, that&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in many cases really a cleaning up of bad debts</p>
<p>and bad practices.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s say economically.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is the changing relationships,</p>
<p>the changing world order, the changing relationships</p>
<p>with the United States and other countries,</p>
<p>which is becoming much less cooperative</p>
<p>and much more warlike, much more confrontational.</p>
<p>Those two things, the domestic debt problem</p>
<p>and the domestic, has led to what&rsquo;s called core,</p>
<p>what they call core leadership,</p>
<p>which means a leadership more around him</p>
<p>that is less challenging</p>
<p>because they believe in history</p>
<p>that during very difficult times,</p>
<p>a more centrally controlled decision making process</p>
<p>lends itself better than to a more fragmented</p>
<p>political contentious project.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s basically what&rsquo;s going on now.</p>
<p>You said it very eloquently,</p>
<p>but you mean the leadership is surrounded by yes men</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of centralized control.</p>
<p>That characterization is much more black and white</p>
<p>than it really is.</p>
<p>But it leans towards that direction.</p>
<p>Like for example, of the standing members</p>
<p>of the Politburo, four are more allotted,</p>
<p>three are less so.</p>
<p>You have to understand that it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>a collective leadership at the top.</p>
<p>And then of course, there&rsquo;s just jockeying for power</p>
<p>in a highly political sense at the top.</p>
<p>But no one leader can be successful</p>
<p>against all those powers at the top.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very politically negotiating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very much more like if you put in the United States</p>
<p>the Democrats and the Republicans</p>
<p>and they had to be in the same government</p>
<p>and they work it out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of something like that.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s that struggle, but it&rsquo;s an internal struggle.</p>
<p>Where do you put the importance of some of these ideas</p>
<p>at the founding of the United States</p>
<p>when now we&rsquo;re talking about that at the context of China,</p>
<p>the freedom of speech, freedoms?</p>
<p>What China is doing with the central management</p>
<p>of a lot of things, it&rsquo;s enabling a lot of growth,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also limiting people on the very basic level</p>
<p>in terms of freedom.</p>
<p>The kind of freedom that I think can lead</p>
<p>to entrepreneurship, to starting new businesses,</p>
<p>to having big dreams and chasing those dreams</p>
<p>and then creating totally new things in whatever the space,</p>
<p>maybe in technology, in business and whatever.</p>
<p>How important is that as a metric for society?</p>
<p>Well, they have a view, which is the idea of a dialectic,</p>
<p>which means that two things are at obvious,</p>
<p>that everything comes with pros and cons</p>
<p>and two opposites exist.</p>
<p>And you want the benefits of those two opposites</p>
<p>and how do you deal with the benefits of those two opposites?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you want the capital markets</p>
<p>because it gets money into the hands of the entrepreneurs</p>
<p>who are motivated, they build fortunes,</p>
<p>and that drives an economy to do very well.</p>
<p>And at the same time, it produces the other problems,</p>
<p>the wealth gaps, the other problems,</p>
<p>the debt cycle that we&rsquo;re talking about and so on.</p>
<p>And Deng Xiaoping, how do you reconcile communism</p>
<p>and the market economy and the capital markets?</p>
<p>And he famously said,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s a white cat or a black cat,</p>
<p>just as long as it catches mice.</p>
<p>In other words, if it works in making the country richer,</p>
<p>then that becomes the objective</p>
<p>and then they move that along.</p>
<p>So there are these conflicts.</p>
<p>And one of the leaders described it to me as follows,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s confusion and it goes back</p>
<p>over a period of time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a hierarchy and it&rsquo;s an extension of the family,</p>
<p>he described it.</p>
<p>And he said, the United States is a country of individuals</p>
<p>and individualism, and that is its vibrancy</p>
<p>that we see the individual rights to speak up,</p>
<p>the individual protection of the individual,</p>
<p>individual property rights and all of those things</p>
<p>is of paramount importance.</p>
<p>And we build our organization.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why democracy is from the bottom up</p>
<p>or even a company, we&rsquo;ll get together</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll be partners to prosper together.</p>
<p>That is the American approach.</p>
<p>He was describing that in China,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an extension of the Confucian family, essentially.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s almost like there&rsquo;s a hierarchy.</p>
<p>And so what they think about is the common good,</p>
<p>not the individualism.</p>
<p>So for example, if they want a high speed rail</p>
<p>to go from one place to another,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s best in the common good,</p>
<p>then the individual protections</p>
<p>that would stand in the way of doing that</p>
<p>would be of secondary concern.</p>
<p>So that notion of controlling.</p>
<p>So for example, what they&rsquo;re doing with video games,</p>
<p>they control what type of video games</p>
<p>and how many hours a day kids can be on video games</p>
<p>operating in that way,</p>
<p>because they believe that that&rsquo;s good for the society</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s very controlling.</p>
<p>In the United States,</p>
<p>I think probably most parents would say, leave it to me.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a matter between me and my kids.</p>
<p>The same thing has to do with data.</p>
<p>In other words, in the United States,</p>
<p>who controls the data?</p>
<p>Does the company control the data?</p>
<p>Do you individually control the data?</p>
<p>And so the inclination would be to figure that out,</p>
<p>but nobody would say that the government</p>
<p>is going to control the data</p>
<p>because of our inclination of really anti government control.</p>
<p>In China, it would be that the government</p>
<p>will control the data</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s going to be best for the society.</p>
<p>And it depends who you trust.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s, so that difference in philosophy</p>
<p>is very much at the heart of that.</p>
<p>As far as your question in terms of effectiveness,</p>
<p>it really is, in China&rsquo;s case,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s how you balance the things, right?</p>
<p>So what they&rsquo;re attempting to do</p>
<p>is to create a lot of freedom and creativity</p>
<p>in areas that are not political, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>And so you see a lot of entrepreneurship,</p>
<p>you see a lot of product development,</p>
<p>you see a lot of creativity happening in that way.</p>
<p>So the stereotype that you don&rsquo;t see creativity happening</p>
<p>is an old stereotype,</p>
<p>whereas a lot of creativity is certainly happening.</p>
<p>And the system can work well</p>
<p>if they can achieve that kind of balance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s proven to have worked well.</p>
<p>Since I started going there in 1984,</p>
<p>per capita income, real per capita income,</p>
<p>has increased by 26 times.</p>
<p>The longevity rate has increased by 10 years.</p>
<p>The poverty rate has fallen from 88% to less than 1%</p>
<p>in terms of basics like starvation and things.</p>
<p>And if you read history, Plato&rsquo;s Republic,</p>
<p>he talks about the cycles, democracy and autocratic</p>
<p>and the benevolent despot and all of that,</p>
<p>each has their own vulnerability.</p>
<p>The vulnerability of democracy,</p>
<p>which has been a remarkable, remarkable system</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t have to extol the benefits of it,</p>
<p>but the vulnerability of it has always been</p>
<p>the internal conflict that produces itself as anarchy.</p>
<p>In World War II, four democracies</p>
<p>chose to be autocracies</p>
<p>because there was internal disorder</p>
<p>and there was the belief, will somebody bring about order</p>
<p>and get control of the situation?</p>
<p>That was in Germany, Italy, Japan and Spain.</p>
<p>They were parliamentary systems</p>
<p>that turned themselves over to that.</p>
<p>So both systems have vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>I think the main thing that we need to think about</p>
<p>is those vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Democracy is an amazing system</p>
<p>because the adherence to the rules and the system</p>
<p>and the checks and balances is quite amazing</p>
<p>and it gives it a flexibility to change without civil wars.</p>
<p>But there has to be the respect of the rules.</p>
<p>And when you see something like</p>
<p>they will not accept elections</p>
<p>or they will not accept rules, history has shown,</p>
<p>when the causes that people are behind</p>
<p>are more important to them than the system,</p>
<p>the system is in jeopardy.</p>
<p>So we have a situation that&rsquo;s very much like that</p>
<p>in terms of, let&rsquo;s say, the 2024 elections.</p>
<p>I believe that there&rsquo;s a very high chance</p>
<p>that neither side will accept losing, for example.</p>
<p>And so we have that kind of a situation.</p>
<p>So one would hope that one could rise above</p>
<p>the disagreements and rely on the system</p>
<p>for resolving disagreements.</p>
<p>Because if that doesn&rsquo;t happen, then we have our own chaos.</p>
<p>So the kind of the trend that started in 2020,</p>
<p>or I mean, I suppose it&rsquo;s been there,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been growing.</p>
<p>One representation of this internal disorder</p>
<p>has been the growing trend of being skeptical</p>
<p>about the results of the election.</p>
<p>Well, it started before that.</p>
<p>There was the emergence of population</p>
<p>before President Trump was elected.</p>
<p>He was basically elected as a populist</p>
<p>because there was a large percentage of the population</p>
<p>that felt that the system didn&rsquo;t work for them.</p>
<p>And he tapped into that.</p>
<p>And he was largely elected as a populist leader,</p>
<p>first populist leader in a developed country.</p>
<p>And so populism began then.</p>
<p>And that was a battle of one group against the other group.</p>
<p>And so since then, it&rsquo;s been like that</p>
<p>and it continued to grow.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned the vulnerability of democracy,</p>
<p>that internal disorder is the vulnerability of democracy.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the vulnerability of a system like China?</p>
<p>Maybe one way to say is put China aside</p>
<p>and look at history, look at Soviet Union.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the vulnerability of a communist type system?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll call it both communist and autocratic,</p>
<p>depending on how much autocracy,</p>
<p>is that it lacks flexibility.</p>
<p>It lacks the ability,</p>
<p>but I should deal with them differently.</p>
<p>In other words, there&rsquo;s the economic system.</p>
<p>The economic system threatens motivation and productivity.</p>
<p>So communism or socialism has to be done in a way</p>
<p>where you can threaten productivity.</p>
<p>Capitalism has, and what I mean by that,</p>
<p>I mean free markets and capital markets</p>
<p>have been an effective way of allocating resources</p>
<p>and also creating the incentives and the resources,</p>
<p>providing the resources for the inventiveness of new ideas.</p>
<p>And so if I compare that, what the Chinese have done</p>
<p>to a large extent is to recognize that</p>
<p>and have made a move.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the seeming dialectic or the conflict</p>
<p>between those two things exists.</p>
<p>But anyway, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>As far as an autocratic system,</p>
<p>rather than one man, one vote from the population up,</p>
<p>the risks of the autocratic system</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s enough discontent that arises</p>
<p>that the system doesn&rsquo;t have the flexibility</p>
<p>and that rather than bending, it breaks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the big risk.</p>
<p>The notion of trying to control a population</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s that, rather than giving it the flexibility.</p>
<p>So that would be the big risk of the autocratic system.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the human, because you mentioned</p>
<p>like the top gets bigger with the empires</p>
<p>and you start to get things for granted.</p>
<p>Is some of this just human nature?</p>
<p>So the concern with China, with autocratic nations,</p>
<p>the concern with the Third Reich, the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>was that fundamentally at the individual level,</p>
<p>the humans involved at the top,</p>
<p>they start becoming, they&rsquo;re starting to lose touch</p>
<p>with reality in a way that no longer makes them.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s the representation,</p>
<p>the flexibility that you&rsquo;re referring to.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, in a democracy, you could change.</p>
<p>You can go as far left or as far right.</p>
<p>You can change the leaders easily.</p>
<p>And so the people don&rsquo;t become,</p>
<p>they pretty much only have themselves to blame.</p>
<p>And one of the problems of that</p>
<p>is they may not choose the best leaders,</p>
<p>but they have that flexibility.</p>
<p>So vote and you get what you wanted.</p>
<p>In the case of the autocratic, let&rsquo;s say leaders,</p>
<p>and then the movement from democracies to autocracies,</p>
<p>what you see normally that movement</p>
<p>is that one of the systems is not working.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say the democracy is not effectively,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s arguing with each other</p>
<p>and nobody&rsquo;s getting anything done.</p>
<p>You know, like Mussolini,</p>
<p>the trains are not running on time.</p>
<p>And that would be the example,</p>
<p>geez, this place has gotten chaotic.</p>
<p>Will somebody get to control?</p>
<p>And then you get the autocratic</p>
<p>and then he&rsquo;s autocratic enough to boss people around.</p>
<p>And then you follow those kinds of orders.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like maybe a CEO in a powerful company</p>
<p>going around and that could work well</p>
<p>or it could work badly.</p>
<p>Most companies are run as like autocracies in a sense.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s the hierarchy and the command economy</p>
<p>and that kind of thing.</p>
<p>And that can work well or not.</p>
<p>But then quite often when you get the populist autocratic,</p>
<p>their personality is something that they want to fight</p>
<p>and they become more nationalistic</p>
<p>and they tend to become more militaristic.</p>
<p>And human nature at that stage lends itself to fighting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an arc here that when we think of a country</p>
<p>and we say we, and we think of a country,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not true, it&rsquo;s not like that.</p>
<p>There are individuals who change.</p>
<p>One generation dies and another generation comes along.</p>
<p>And one of those arcs is that the one generation</p>
<p>of the ones who have been through war</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t wanna go to war and are more happily willing</p>
<p>to abide by whatever the rules are.</p>
<p>As you get farther along into that cycle</p>
<p>and you get a new generation and they forget about wars</p>
<p>and the horrors of wars, then they want to fight.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re seeing right now the emerging</p>
<p>of fight for right and what that means</p>
<p>is you see it internally, fight where are you</p>
<p>and fight for that thing and they mean fight.</p>
<p>And then externally, fight, are you going to be</p>
<p>the strong one who will fight and win?</p>
<p>And that develops on both sides, this fight and win</p>
<p>and each side is cheering each other on into a war.</p>
<p>But that comes by those who really have not experienced war</p>
<p>because it comes in their part of their lifetime.</p>
<p>Humans are fascinating.</p>
<p>And by the way, human nature has not changed</p>
<p>over the thousands of years.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s so interesting because like in doing this study</p>
<p>and it comes across in the study,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like watching the same movie over and over again.</p>
<p>You know, you see the arc and you see it happen</p>
<p>over and over again.</p>
<p>The only things that seem to change are the clothes</p>
<p>people wear and the technologies they use.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then somebody probably would disagree</p>
<p>with you about the clothes.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s also cycles within fashions.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;re not even creative there.</p>
<p>What do you make of Russia and Vladimir Putin?</p>
<p>What do you think about Putin as a leader,</p>
<p>as a human being on this world stage within the context</p>
<p>of the cycles of empires that you think about?</p>
<p>Well, Putin came to power at the failure</p>
<p>of Russia&rsquo;s last order.</p>
<p>So there was the end of communism</p>
<p>and there was the development of the market economy,</p>
<p>the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>And at that time, he was appointed by Yeltsin</p>
<p>who was an alcoholic and had problems managing</p>
<p>and was put into power.</p>
<p>And the conditions in the Russia were,</p>
<p>there was anarchy, there was no money.</p>
<p>It had the classic end of cycle ingredients.</p>
<p>It was broke.</p>
<p>It was people were fighting with each other.</p>
<p>It was in the anarchy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when he came to power.</p>
<p>And there were not institutions.</p>
<p>The whole thing had collapsed</p>
<p>and it was not effective ministry of education,</p>
<p>ministry of anything.</p>
<p>And so the idea was that they needed 25 years of stability</p>
<p>and they needed a democracy</p>
<p>and they needed the improvement of capital markets.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s been in that position as I guess I would call him</p>
<p>a semi autocratic leader in that from all indications,</p>
<p>he would respect the democracy and he&rsquo;s very popular.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s won democratic elections</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s been a strong leader</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s brought peace and stability</p>
<p>to Russia after the breakup of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a strong leader in pursuit of the country&rsquo;s interest</p>
<p>in a way where Russia is not a significant economic power</p>
<p>but it is a significant military power.</p>
<p>So the issues, and then there&rsquo;s a strong alliance</p>
<p>between Russia and China now.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of the lay of the land.</p>
<p>And then there are sensitivities.</p>
<p>The Ukraine issue is a sensitivity</p>
<p>because of there are a lot of Russians</p>
<p>who live in the Ukraine</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s also the issue of NATO on their border.</p>
<p>So there are those kinds of things</p>
<p>and he has military power</p>
<p>and he has a strong alliance with China.</p>
<p>And I guess that&rsquo;s my best summary</p>
<p>of what his position is.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a strong leader, popular.</p>
<p>These are not subjective interpretations.</p>
<p>These are objective interpretations.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s interesting just in this conversation,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not sort of doing the usual criticism</p>
<p>of any one particular system.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking at these systems</p>
<p>from the perspective of history.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just describing how they work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s often times when you talk about what Russia is today</p>
<p>or what the Soviet Union was or what China is today</p>
<p>is you start to criticize.</p>
<p>Well, they do this kind of censorship</p>
<p>or they do this kind of,</p>
<p>they limit freedoms in this kind of way.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re just kind of describing this</p>
<p>as a nation with ideas, what they think is right.</p>
<p>This is how they hope to get it to work.</p>
<p>This is why it&rsquo;s working.</p>
<p>This is what&rsquo;s not working.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s metrics that show that it&rsquo;s not working.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a refreshing way to think about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy though, I mean, you got some criticism</p>
<p>saying that I think China is a strict parent.</p>
<p>Some people criticize these countries for doing,</p>
<p>for violating human rights.</p>
<p>I suppose there&rsquo;s some people that criticize the United States</p>
<p>for violating human rights.</p>
<p>But what are your thoughts on the world stage today</p>
<p>about some of the behaviors it has governed</p>
<p>in terms of respecting the rights,</p>
<p>the basic rights of human beings?</p>
<p>You described accurately how I just tried to look at this</p>
<p>and how I just tried to look at things in a non,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to impute my values on anybody.</p>
<p>I mean, there are intolerable things.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not saying there aren&rsquo;t intolerable things.</p>
<p>But one of the great things of being an American here</p>
<p>is that I grew up with all different nationalities,</p>
<p>having all different points of view</p>
<p>and all different religions</p>
<p>and all different ways of operating.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve come to treasure the fact that that is,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s their business is their business.</p>
<p>And then the question is, where do you cross the line</p>
<p>under what circumstances</p>
<p>that others have got to do it my way.</p>
<p>And then when you do it internationally,</p>
<p>the issue of what is a sovereign state,</p>
<p>which as I say in the piece of Westphalia</p>
<p>and you have borders and then when do you cross the line</p>
<p>that my way of doing things</p>
<p>has got to be their way of doing things</p>
<p>or what are the various rights.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a very delicate question</p>
<p>or a very difficult question.</p>
<p>And we all have responsibilities to different parties</p>
<p>and we all have different levels of knowledge</p>
<p>about those particular things.</p>
<p>So for example, as an international investor,</p>
<p>I have a responsibility to my investors.</p>
<p>Those who run companies have a responsibility to theirs</p>
<p>of how do they run that.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re taking Nike or Snickers and so on</p>
<p>and Americans can decide</p>
<p>whether they wanna buy Chinese products</p>
<p>or not buy Chinese products,</p>
<p>we are all faced with those types of choices.</p>
<p>So you have what do you wanna do in your constituency</p>
<p>and you have your choices.</p>
<p>And then beyond that, in many cases,</p>
<p>the issues are quite complex,</p>
<p>like there are geopolitical questions that enter into it.</p>
<p>So, and then I believe that if you disconnected,</p>
<p>if all those entities like myself,</p>
<p>the businesses doing business with China disconnected,</p>
<p>I think that that would be disastrous,</p>
<p>economically disastrous.</p>
<p>And it would also be reduce the understanding</p>
<p>that comes from working together that helps to reduce wars.</p>
<p>And so these are all complicated.</p>
<p>So what we do is, and who makes it my opinion</p>
<p>matters the most?</p>
<p>Why should it be my opinion that matters the most</p>
<p>in making that decision?</p>
<p>So I largely look at the government guidance</p>
<p>that I get not only from my own government,</p>
<p>but from the other governments and I follow the rules.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in 40, we invest in 40 countries.</p>
<p>And we wanna do that in the best way</p>
<p>to provide the diversified portfolio.</p>
<p>And we sort of need that.</p>
<p>Every one of those countries has similar complexities.</p>
<p>There are always one issue or another,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s only so much that we really understand</p>
<p>about all of those issues.</p>
<p>So we rely largely on the guidance that we get.</p>
<p>Yeah, you have to empathize and show respect</p>
<p>to the culture of the place, the way things are done.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t necessarily,</p>
<p>the way you heal relationships between nations</p>
<p>is like you said, you work together.</p>
<p>And that requires kind of to listen</p>
<p>maybe more than you talk.</p>
<p>And I think people in the public sphere</p>
<p>talk a lot about China without really listening,</p>
<p>without understanding much about China,</p>
<p>though one of the things that makes me really sad</p>
<p>because I know how to speak Russian</p>
<p>and I know how much is lost in translation.</p>
<p>It makes me sad that I&rsquo;ll never really get to know</p>
<p>the Chinese culture because like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never really get to know the language,</p>
<p>the literature, just talk to regular people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the government or officials or scientists,</p>
<p>just regular folks, get the culture.</p>
<p>I think if you don&rsquo;t understand the culture,</p>
<p>just the basics of the human nature,</p>
<p>what people love about their country,</p>
<p>about their family or the kind of hopes they have,</p>
<p>what kind of values they have,</p>
<p>without that you&rsquo;re not gonna be able to</p>
<p>fully connect with them.</p>
<p>And you have to do that first</p>
<p>to have a chance of building a good world.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree with you more.</p>
<p>I was very lucky because as I say,</p>
<p>since 1984, so for more than half of my life,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been going there and the common people</p>
<p>and all sorts of people, and I&rsquo;ve got to meet them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t speak the language,</p>
<p>but a combination of through translators</p>
<p>or them speaking English and being in situations.</p>
<p>I had my son go to school, a local school,</p>
<p>and we developed those kinds of understandings.</p>
<p>I think that, but the not wanting</p>
<p>to know the other perspective</p>
<p>is the thing that&rsquo;s most scary.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m right now in the middle</p>
<p>and all I want to try to do</p>
<p>is to help mutual understanding.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, if there were questions probing me,</p>
<p>asking me, what is it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not on one side or another.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be on one side or another.</p>
<p>I believe that each has their right within there</p>
<p>to approach their different culture in their own way.</p>
<p>So many ways you gave an example.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re not doing harm to others, I mean,</p>
<p>but that issue of trying to understand</p>
<p>is so much better.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean agree with.</p>
<p>If you are wanting to out clever</p>
<p>and out compete somebody,</p>
<p>it still pays to understand what they&rsquo;re thinking.</p>
<p>So to achieve understanding of what they&rsquo;re thinking,</p>
<p>even if you want to go to war with them,</p>
<p>that understanding is the best thing to have.</p>
<p>What we have now is a situation</p>
<p>in which there&rsquo;s an enemy mentality.</p>
<p>And that means that anything that serves,</p>
<p>seems to be like understanding or conveying understanding,</p>
<p>seems to mistakenly create the notion</p>
<p>of I&rsquo;m on their side in a war.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of a dangerous thing</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a momentum here to fight.</p>
<p>Henry Kissinger praises your new book</p>
<p>and you thank him in it in the dedication.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your relationship like with him?</p>
<p>What makes him interesting?</p>
<p>Maybe what makes him controversial?</p>
<p>What makes him such a central figure in history?</p>
<p>First, most importantly, he&rsquo;s unique about seeing things</p>
<p>through all the others eyes.</p>
<p>So if you were, it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a chess game.</p>
<p>I mean, I think geopolitics is like a chess game,</p>
<p>but with multiple chess players playing the same game.</p>
<p>So imagine there are six people around</p>
<p>playing the chess game and he could sit in each seat</p>
<p>and he could know how they see it, okay?</p>
<p>And see it in a calm way of how they see it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s unique in that way.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s 98 years old and he&rsquo;s equally able to do that.</p>
<p>And he has a background in which he&rsquo;s a historian.</p>
<p>So he really understands history super terrifically.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t understand economic history as much.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why to some extent we enjoy having a conversation</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s interested in the economic piece he doesn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m so interested in the geopolitical piece</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t know as well.</p>
<p>But anyway, he&rsquo;s able to do that,</p>
<p>but not only a historian, but a practitioner.</p>
<p>So when you go from an academic to a practitioner</p>
<p>who has that talent to see things through others eyes</p>
<p>in an objective way and to be strategic</p>
<p>rather than just tactical, that&rsquo;s a very special person</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why Henry is, to me, a very special person.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s lived a fascinating life.</p>
<p>Just all of the world events he&rsquo;s been involved in</p>
<p>is fascinating and like you said,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s such an interesting skill to have</p>
<p>to consider what are the concerns, the hope, the dreams,</p>
<p>the fears of all the people at the table.</p>
<p>What are they thinking?</p>
<p>I find that people don&rsquo;t, once again, don&rsquo;t do that enough</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s the obvious thing you should be doing,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s business deals or political negotiation</p>
<p>or geopolitical negotiation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m often surprised, again, sorry to go to the Russian thing</p>
<p>because I hear Putin talk in Russian</p>
<p>and you start to infer certain intentions,</p>
<p>like not the trivial stuff, like the human being.</p>
<p>What is that human being hoping for himself,</p>
<p>for his country, for his close inner circle,</p>
<p>for the bigger, and I just see that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s often just lost in translation.</p>
<p>I just see American leaders talking to Putin</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just not, there&rsquo;s not a connection.</p>
<p>Absolutely, I know exactly what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>It has never failed that in my listening to a conversation</p>
<p>or even reading a speech and you see then it reported,</p>
<p>inevitably, the reporter picks some headline characterization</p>
<p>that has very little to do with what was really happening</p>
<p>but might be a headline grabber</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s at some kind of distortion</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lack of understanding</p>
<p>of really what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s okay, let me ask you a couple questions</p>
<p>about cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve had a few opinions about Bitcoin over the years.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about Bitcoin today,</p>
<p>its role in the global financial system</p>
<p>and just in human society in general?</p>
<p>Well, the evolution of Bitcoin over the years</p>
<p>is one of the things that has influenced changes in my view.</p>
<p>It has proven itself something like 10, 11 years ago.</p>
<p>Imagine the programming of this and you throw it out</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the idea.</p>
<p>It has not been hacked.</p>
<p>It has operated, it has built,</p>
<p>it has come an amazing way over that 11 years</p>
<p>to be maybe probably the most excited topic</p>
<p>among a lot of people and has been used</p>
<p>and is now has obtained the status of having imputed value.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is one of those assets</p>
<p>that is an alternative money.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re entering an era</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s going to be a competition of monies.</p>
<p>Because of the printing of fiat money</p>
<p>and the depreciated value,</p>
<p>there will be a competition of monies</p>
<p>and Bitcoin is part of that competition.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;ll be many monies, not just crypto monies,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;ll be central bank crypto monies,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;ll be different kinds of monies.</p>
<p>And even monies are things that you buy and sell.</p>
<p>NFTs can become a type of money.</p>
<p>You own it and it&rsquo;s an investment</p>
<p>and you could say I&rsquo;d rather own it than own Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Has Ray Dalio bought any NFTs?</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>But only just because I definitely want to buy NFTs</p>
<p>to just experience them.</p>
<p>Like I think I should produce one and I should.</p>
<p>I should have asked that.</p>
<p>Have you minted an NFT?</p>
<p>You probably should just to know what it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>This stuff is happening.</p>
<p>This stuff is real and how it operates.</p>
<p>But like all new real things, some are gonna go</p>
<p>and some are gonna, it&rsquo;s like in the internet</p>
<p>in the year 2000, pets.com could have been a great,</p>
<p>but maybe pets.com doesn&rsquo;t make it and who knows.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the beauty of the competitive system</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;ll evolve and some things will be treasured</p>
<p>and some things will be trashed.</p>
<p>But when I look at it, I think we are in an environment</p>
<p>of what is an alternative money?</p>
<p>A money has two purposes, a medium of exchange</p>
<p>and a storehold of wealth.</p>
<p>And we are looking for, and it&rsquo;s portable.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s best if it&rsquo;s recognized in other countries.</p>
<p>So gold is one of those.</p>
<p>So I look at it as an alternative gold,</p>
<p>but I look at a number of things as alternative gold.</p>
<p>And I think that, and gold is still my favorite</p>
<p>because of certain qualities.</p>
<p>For example, you can&rsquo;t trace it.</p>
<p>In Bitcoin, you can trace who owns it,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s going and so on.</p>
<p>Governments can&rsquo;t have that ability to trace it and so on.</p>
<p>A gold piece of coin, it&rsquo;s not connected.</p>
<p>I think not connected has benefits,</p>
<p>particularly in a world where maybe connections</p>
<p>can be more risky.</p>
<p>And then also gold has been for many thousands of years</p>
<p>universally recognized as a source of money.</p>
<p>And central banks, it&rsquo;s the third largest source of money</p>
<p>in central bank reserves.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think Bitcoin is going to serve</p>
<p>those types of purposes and so on.</p>
<p>So for various reasons, I prefer gold to the other,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a little bit part of my mix.</p>
<p>But then you look at it, it hit, I think 69,000 this year</p>
<p>is the high Bitcoin hit.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible, you mentioned gold,</p>
<p>do you think it&rsquo;s possible it reaches very high numbers,</p>
<p>like one million that some people talk about?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s possible because the way I look at it</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s a certain amount of it.</p>
<p>A certain amount of it, and there&rsquo;s a certain amount of gold.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll use gold as a benchmark.</p>
<p>The amount of it is worth about $1 trillion.</p>
<p>Total crypto is about 2.2 trillion.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say Bitcoin, it&rsquo;s $1 trillion.</p>
<p>If you take the amount of money that is in gold</p>
<p>that is not used for jewelry purposes</p>
<p>and not used by central banks,</p>
<p>and I assume Bitcoin won&rsquo;t be used for jewelry purposes</p>
<p>or central bank purposes,</p>
<p>that amount in gold is about $5 trillion.</p>
<p>So right now, if you were to have a portfolio</p>
<p>that has gold and crypto, gold and Bitcoin,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s worth about 20% of the value of gold.</p>
<p>Do I think it&rsquo;s going to be worth more than gold</p>
<p>in terms of that mix?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll be worth more than gold.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say it became worth as much as gold.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe it will be.</p>
<p>I think that 20% sounds kind of about right.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t know what the right answer is.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the question of what is all of that pool</p>
<p>of money that let&rsquo;s say gold and gold equivalents</p>
<p>relative to everything else?</p>
<p>Does it go from, let&rsquo;s call it</p>
<p>six, seven, eight trillion to 16 trillion?</p>
<p>Maybe it could double.</p>
<p>It depends what it is in the world environment.</p>
<p>But basically, if you use gold as a measure,</p>
<p>it just makes no sense</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s going to be used that much more.</p>
<p>Am I sure about that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about anything.</p>
<p>But logically, it seems to me that there&rsquo;s a limitation</p>
<p>on its price in relationship to other things</p>
<p>that are like it.</p>
<p>Let me ask for your deep financial analysis</p>
<p>on a very important issue.</p>
<p>I just talked a couple days ago with Elon Musk.</p>
<p>He wants to put a literal Dogecoin on the moon.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about Dogecoin?</p>
<p>And do you think it&rsquo;ll be the official currency?</p>
<p>How many be reserve currency on the moon and on Mars?</p>
<p>My reaction is that&rsquo;s cute.</p>
<p>I remember Elon when he first got,</p>
<p>he first got his money from PayPal.</p>
<p>I think he said to me it was,</p>
<p>he got $180 million, $90 million.</p>
<p>He decided to say, why aren&rsquo;t we going to outer space?</p>
<p>And he wanted to take a spaceship that would be modified</p>
<p>using Russian technology to put a plant</p>
<p>and a watering can on the moon or on Mars, I think it was.</p>
<p>And he said, first life on Mars,</p>
<p>or first life on that as an inspiring notion.</p>
<p>And so then there&rsquo;s always what&rsquo;s behind it.</p>
<p>I have a lot of respect for Elon&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to do other things behind it.</p>
<p>And so I would take that as symbolic</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d be asking him what&rsquo;s behind it, what&rsquo;s next.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m also just on the topic of Dogecoin and memecoin</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some aspect of humor and lightheartedness</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really interesting about the way we communicate,</p>
<p>what ideas become viral,</p>
<p>how to captivate people with ideas.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about taking things too seriously</p>
<p>that somehow slows it all down and it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of human nature somehow.</p>
<p>So like humor is part of this whole thing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked about the importance of writing ideas down</p>
<p>and you have a fascinating.</p>
<p>Principles in particular.</p>
<p>Principles.</p>
<p>And you have this really nice thing in your book</p>
<p>where you actually, I mean there&rsquo;s such a brilliant way.</p>
<p>You have such a brilliant way of highlighting</p>
<p>which parts are extra important and you make them bold.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a brilliant idea.</p>
<p>But let me just ask the high level question</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s a good system for taking notes?</p>
<p>Well, I find that almost everything happens</p>
<p>over and over again.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re in the blizzard of these things happening.</p>
<p>And what I found is that if I&rsquo;m making a decision</p>
<p>that after I make the decision usually</p>
<p>or write at the time,</p>
<p>if I pause and reflect and I write my principle down,</p>
<p>in other words, principle is sort of a recipe,</p>
<p>what would I use to, how would I make that decision?</p>
<p>And what are the criteria around it?</p>
<p>I find that I make it much more clear, it becomes clearer</p>
<p>and it applies to the next thing that comes along,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be that way.</p>
<p>Because everything happens over and over and over again</p>
<p>and I think people make the mistake</p>
<p>of looking at just the one like it&rsquo;s the first one.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, they have the first problem of this sort</p>
<p>or the first child or whatever it is.</p>
<p>And this has been happening plenty of times.</p>
<p>And so if you have the principles,</p>
<p>I found that that helped me think more clearly about it</p>
<p>and it helped me communicate better, like why.</p>
<p>And so over the years, over the last 30 years or so,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>I did it originally to communicate very well</p>
<p>with the people I work with.</p>
<p>I set up my company and it was very important</p>
<p>to have good communication.</p>
<p>And then we could debate the principles</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s the process.</p>
<p>I urge people to do that.</p>
<p>There are many excellent decision makers</p>
<p>and I just wish that they wrote down their principles.</p>
<p>When this set, so for example,</p>
<p>we talk about Henry Kissinger and his new book</p>
<p>is gonna come out with a book on leadership.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t just describe the leaders,</p>
<p>describe then what about them were the essential elements</p>
<p>to make a good leader under what circumstances.</p>
<p>And so if we think about that,</p>
<p>then also then you begin to think in a principled way.</p>
<p>And then when you start to think in a principled way,</p>
<p>life becomes, it&rsquo;s so much easier to make decisions</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s so much less confusing</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like coming up on a species</p>
<p>and you say, okay, well, what species is it?</p>
<p>Not just another, it&rsquo;s a thing.</p>
<p>No, what species is it</p>
<p>and how do I deal with that species effectively?</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what that is.</p>
<p>And so I encourage people to write it down.</p>
<p>I wish anybody who&rsquo;s successful wrote down their principles</p>
<p>or their recipes for making those types of decisions.</p>
<p>So the events of interest here happens</p>
<p>over and over and over in similar ways.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;re looking for the patterns</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re defining the process,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right to respond to those patterns</p>
<p>and you call that the principles</p>
<p>and that allows you to deal with the future effectively.</p>
<p>So like that codifies the lessons from the past</p>
<p>to be able to deal with the future.</p>
<p>What advice do you have for young folks today?</p>
<p>In high school, in college, thinking about how to live,</p>
<p>have a career they can be proud of</p>
<p>or maybe have a life they can be proud of?</p>
<p>Know yourself, follow your passion,</p>
<p>make your work and passion the same thing</p>
<p>while considering the money part</p>
<p>because money will get you freedom and choice</p>
<p>and be able to bank that.</p>
<p>But if you know yourself, feel the pull</p>
<p>and pursue that passion.</p>
<p>And along those lines, by the way,</p>
<p>I found that using personality profile tests</p>
<p>has been very helpful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used those for about 25 years</p>
<p>for people to help to understand themselves</p>
<p>and understand each other.</p>
<p>So I created a free one that is called Principles You.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s online.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s had remarkable, loving people who&rsquo;ve taken it,</p>
<p>learn about themselves,</p>
<p>but also you can put in somebody else</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll tell you about your relationship with them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like 30 minutes is a quick discovery,</p>
<p>but the main thing is to understand on your journey,</p>
<p>your hero&rsquo;s journey that you will have mistakes</p>
<p>and you will have weaknesses</p>
<p>and to understand those, not fight those</p>
<p>because by understanding mistakes,</p>
<p>you will learn not to make mistakes again.</p>
<p>I have a principle which is pain plus reflection</p>
<p>equals progress.</p>
<p>And so that reflection is important to know yourself,</p>
<p>know your pulls, know your weaknesses.</p>
<p>And when you also know your weaknesses</p>
<p>and the strengths of other people,</p>
<p>there are people who have strengths where you&rsquo;re weak</p>
<p>and you have strengths where they&rsquo;re weak.</p>
<p>And to be able to work well together</p>
<p>is the most effective way of achieving success.</p>
<p>So yeah, it&rsquo;s that journey.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a life arc and there&rsquo;s a journey</p>
<p>and you wanna make it the best that you can make it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like a video game.</p>
<p>It has the challenges and the obstacles</p>
<p>and the learning experiences and the temptations</p>
<p>and all of that.</p>
<p>And the maximizing learning to go where you wanna go</p>
<p>to achieve the life you want is the most important.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of maybe a long winded way of saying it,</p>
<p>but to learn, I think I&rsquo;ll try to say it simply.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a five step process.</p>
<p>Step one is know your goals, know what you&rsquo;re going after.</p>
<p>You could have almost anything you want,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t have everything you want.</p>
<p>And so you have to prioritize and you move in that direction.</p>
<p>On the way to your goals,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to encounter your problems and your obstacles.</p>
<p>So step two is understanding your problems</p>
<p>and your obstacles, identify them.</p>
<p>Step three is to diagnose them</p>
<p>to get at the root cause of the problem.</p>
<p>And that could be many root causes,</p>
<p>but it could also be your weaknesses or weaknesses of others,</p>
<p>but you have to be objective about them.</p>
<p>Once you diagnose them, then you go to step four,</p>
<p>which is to design a way to get around them.</p>
<p>And then after you have that design,</p>
<p>you implement that design.</p>
<p>So you have to follow through and do it.</p>
<p>And you do that, and that will then produce its new results,</p>
<p>which should be better results.</p>
<p>I call this kind of a looping process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the evolutionary looping process.</p>
<p>And you just keep doing that</p>
<p>and you learn over a period of time</p>
<p>and you move in the direction that you want.</p>
<p>Last question, and you only have one minute to answer.</p>
<p>You dedicate the book, quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To my grandchildren and those of their generation</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;who will be participants</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;in the continuation of this story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;May the force of evolution be with you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>So let me ask, where&rsquo;s this force of evolution</p>
<p>taking human civilization?</p>
<p>And what in this story that evolution is writing</p>
<p>gives you hope?</p>
<p>Evolution is a direction toward improvement.</p>
<p>And the greatest force is man&rsquo;s capacity to adapt and invent.</p>
<p>And so you see in the charts in the book,</p>
<p>you see that this upward movement, life expectancy,</p>
<p>health, all the things that we think are better,</p>
<p>you see there&rsquo;s a chart</p>
<p>and it shows that over a period of time</p>
<p>and you barely see the downturns</p>
<p>from depressions and wars in that.</p>
<p>That is the greatest power.</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s ability to invent and adapt is evolution</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the greatest power</p>
<p>and that is what gives me justifiable hope.</p>
<p>And a continuation of that, like we mentioned with Elon,</p>
<p>maybe we&rsquo;ll become a multi planetary species.</p>
<p>So not only will we keep creating amazing things</p>
<p>here on Earth, we&rsquo;ll keep expanding out into the cosmos.</p>
<p>My time horizon isn&rsquo;t gonna have me analyzing that yet,</p>
<p>but I hope so and I agree that that would be</p>
<p>in the next.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not gonna ask you</p>
<p>for the best financial system on Mars.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll focus on Earth for now.</p>
<p>Ray, thank you so much for your brilliance,</p>
<p>for the books you&rsquo;ve written,</p>
<p>for the works you&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>for the inspiration of millions.</p>
<p>And thank you for spending your valuable time</p>
<p>here with me today.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ray Dalio.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Ray Dalio himself.</p>
<p>Every time you confront something painful,</p>
<p>you are at a potentially important juncture in your life.</p>
<p>You have the opportunity to choose healthy</p>
<p>and painful truth or unhealthy but comfortable delusion.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
