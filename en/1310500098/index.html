    <p>The following is a conversation with Kate Darling, a researcher at MIT,</p>
<p>interested in social robotics, robot ethics, and generally how technology intersects with society.</p>
<p>She explores the emotional connection between human beings and lifelike machines,</p>
<p>which for me is one of the most exciting topics in all of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>As she writes in her bio, she is a caretaker of several domestic robots,</p>
<p>including her plio dinosaur robots named Yochai, Peter, and Mr. Spaghetti.</p>
<p>She is one of the funniest and brightest minds I&rsquo;ve ever had the fortune to talk to.</p>
<p>This conversation was recorded recently, but before the outbreak of the pandemic.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Kate Darling.</p>
<p>You co taught robot ethics at Harvard. What are some ethical issues that arise</p>
<p>in the world with robots?</p>
<p>Yeah, that was a reading group that I did when I, like, at the very beginning,</p>
<p>first became interested in this topic. So, I think if I taught that class today,</p>
<p>it would look very, very different. Robot ethics, it sounds very science fictiony,</p>
<p>especially did back then, but I think that some of the issues that people in robot ethics are</p>
<p>concerned with are just around the ethical use of robotic technology in general. So, for example,</p>
<p>responsibility for harm, automated weapon systems, things like privacy and data security,</p>
<p>things like, you know, automation and labor markets. And then personally, I&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>interested in some of the social issues that come out of our social relationships with robots.</p>
<p>One on one relationship with robots.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think most of the stuff we have to talk about is like one on one social stuff. That&rsquo;s what I</p>
<p>love. I think that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re, you love as well and are expert in. But a societal level,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s a presidential candidate now, Andrew Yang running,</p>
<p>concerned about automation and robots and AI in general taking away jobs. He has a proposal of UBI,</p>
<p>universal basic income of everybody gets 1000 bucks as a way to sort of save you if you lose</p>
<p>your job from automation to allow you time to discover what it is that you would like to or</p>
<p>even love to do.</p>
<p>Yes. So I lived in Switzerland for 20 years and universal basic income has been more of a topic</p>
<p>there separate from the whole robots and jobs issue. So it&rsquo;s so interesting to me to see kind</p>
<p>of these Silicon Valley people latch onto this concept that came from a very kind of</p>
<p>left wing socialist, kind of a different place in Europe. But on the automation labor markets</p>
<p>topic, I think that it&rsquo;s very, so sometimes in those conversations, I think people overestimate</p>
<p>where robotic technology is right now. And we also have this fallacy of constantly comparing robots</p>
<p>to humans and thinking of this as a one to one replacement of jobs. So even like Bill Gates a few</p>
<p>years ago said something about, maybe we should have a system that taxes robots for taking people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>jobs. And it just, I mean, I&rsquo;m sure that was taken out of context, he&rsquo;s a really smart guy,</p>
<p>but that sounds to me like kind of viewing it as a one to one replacement versus viewing this</p>
<p>technology as kind of a supplemental tool that of course is going to shake up a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to change the job landscape, but I don&rsquo;t see, you know, robots taking all the</p>
<p>jobs in the next 20 years. That&rsquo;s just not how it&rsquo;s going to work.</p>
<p>Right. So maybe drifting into the land of more personal relationships with robots and</p>
<p>interaction and so on. I got to warn you, I go, I may ask some silly philosophical questions.</p>
<p>I apologize.</p>
<p>Oh, please do.</p>
<p>Okay. Do you think humans will abuse robots in their interactions? So you&rsquo;ve had a lot of,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll talk about it sort of anthropomorphization and this intricate dance,</p>
<p>emotional dance between human and robot, but there seems to be also a darker side where people, when</p>
<p>they treat the other as servants, especially, they can be a little bit abusive or a lot abusive.</p>
<p>Do you think about that? Do you worry about that?</p>
<p>Yeah, I do think about that. So, I mean, one of my main interests is the fact that people</p>
<p>subconsciously treat robots like living things. And even though they know that they&rsquo;re interacting</p>
<p>with a machine and what it means in that context to behave violently. I don&rsquo;t know if you could say</p>
<p>abuse because you&rsquo;re not actually abusing the inner mind of the robot. The robot doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>any feelings.</p>
<p>As far as you know.</p>
<p>Well, yeah. It also depends on how we define feelings and consciousness. But I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another area where people kind of overestimate where we currently are with the technology.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>The robots are not even as smart as insects right now. And so I&rsquo;m not worried about abuse</p>
<p>in that sense. But it is interesting to think about what does people&rsquo;s behavior towards these</p>
<p>things mean for our own behavior? Is it desensitizing the people to be verbally abusive</p>
<p>to a robot or even physically abusive? And we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Right. It&rsquo;s a similar connection from like if you play violent video games, what connection does</p>
<p>that have to desensitization to violence? I haven&rsquo;t read literature on that. I wonder about that.</p>
<p>Because everything I&rsquo;ve heard, people don&rsquo;t seem to any longer be so worried about violent video</p>
<p>games.</p>
<p>Correct. The research on it is, it&rsquo;s a difficult thing to research. So it&rsquo;s sort of inconclusive,</p>
<p>but we seem to have gotten the sense, at least as a society, that people can compartmentalize. When</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something on a screen and you&rsquo;re shooting a bunch of characters or running over people with</p>
<p>your car, that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily translate to you doing that in real life. We do, however,</p>
<p>have some concerns about children playing violent video games. And so we do restrict it there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s based on any real evidence either, but it&rsquo;s just the way that we&rsquo;ve kind of</p>
<p>decided we want to be a little more cautious there. And the reason I think robots are a little</p>
<p>bit different is because there is a lot of research showing that we respond differently</p>
<p>to something in our physical space than something on a screen. We will treat it much more viscerally,</p>
<p>much more like a physical actor. And so it&rsquo;s totally possible that this is not a problem.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the same thing as violence in video games. Maybe restrict it with kids to be safe,</p>
<p>but adults can do what they want. But we just need to ask the question again because we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have any evidence at all yet. Maybe there&rsquo;s an intermediate place too. I did my research</p>
<p>on Twitter. By research, I mean scrolling through your Twitter feed.</p>
<p>You mentioned that you were going at some point to an animal law conference.</p>
<p>So I have to ask, do you think there&rsquo;s something that we can learn</p>
<p>from animal rights that guides our thinking about robots?</p>
<p>Oh, I think there is so much to learn from that. I&rsquo;m actually writing a book on it right now. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why I&rsquo;m going to this conference. So I&rsquo;m writing a book that looks at the history of animal</p>
<p>domestication and how we&rsquo;ve used animals for work, for weaponry, for companionship.</p>
<p>And one of the things the book tries to do is move away from this fallacy that I talked about</p>
<p>of comparing robots and humans because I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the right analogy. But I do think</p>
<p>that on a social level, even on a social level, there&rsquo;s so much that we can learn from looking</p>
<p>at that history because throughout history, we&rsquo;ve treated most animals like tools, like products.</p>
<p>And then some of them we&rsquo;ve treated differently and we&rsquo;re starting to see people treat robots in</p>
<p>really similar ways. So I think it&rsquo;s a really helpful predictor to how we&rsquo;re going to interact</p>
<p>with the robots. Do you think we&rsquo;ll look back at this time like 100 years from now and see</p>
<p>what we do to animals as like similar to the way we view like the Holocaust in World War II?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great question. I mean, I hope so. I am not convinced that we will. But I often wonder,</p>
<p>you know, what are my grandkids going to view as, you know, abhorrent that my generation did</p>
<p>that they would never do? And I&rsquo;m like, well, what&rsquo;s the big deal? You know, it&rsquo;s a fun question</p>
<p>to ask yourself. It always seems that there&rsquo;s atrocities that we discover later. So the things</p>
<p>that at the time people didn&rsquo;t see as, you know, you look at everything from slavery to any kinds</p>
<p>of abuse throughout history to the kind of insane wars that were happening to the way war was carried</p>
<p>out and rape and the kind of violence that was happening during war that we now, you know,</p>
<p>we see as atrocities, but at the time perhaps didn&rsquo;t as much. And so now I have this intuition</p>
<p>that I have this worry, maybe you&rsquo;re going to probably criticize me, but I do anthropomorphize</p>
<p>robots. I don&rsquo;t see a fundamental philosophical difference between a robot and a human being</p>
<p>in terms of once the capabilities are matched. So the fact that we&rsquo;re really far away doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>in terms of capabilities and then that from natural language processing, understanding</p>
<p>and generation to just reasoning and all that stuff. I think once you solve it, I see though,</p>
<p>this is a very gray area and I don&rsquo;t feel comfortable with the kind of abuse that people</p>
<p>throw at robots. Subtle, but I can see it becoming, I can see basically a civil rights movement for</p>
<p>robots in the future. Do you think, let me put it in the form of a question, do you think robots</p>
<p>should have some kinds of rights? Well, it&rsquo;s interesting because I came at this originally</p>
<p>from your perspective. I was like, you know what, there&rsquo;s no fundamental difference between</p>
<p>technology and like human consciousness. Like we, we can probably recreate anything. We just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know how yet. And so there&rsquo;s no reason not to give machines the same rights that we have once,</p>
<p>like you say, they&rsquo;re kind of on an equivalent level. But I realized that that is kind of a</p>
<p>far future question. I still think we should talk about it because I think it&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>But I realized that it&rsquo;s actually, we might need to ask the robot rights question even sooner than</p>
<p>that while the machines are still, quote unquote, really dumb and not on our level because of the</p>
<p>way that we perceive them. And I think one of the lessons we learned from looking at the history of</p>
<p>animal rights and one of the reasons we may not get to a place in a hundred years where we view</p>
<p>it as wrong to, you know, eat or otherwise, you know, use animals for our own purposes is because</p>
<p>historically we&rsquo;ve always protected those things that we relate to the most. So one example is</p>
<p>whales. No one gave a shit about the whales. Am I allowed to swear? Yeah, no one gave a shit about</p>
<p>freedom. Yeah, no one gave a shit about the whales until someone recorded them singing. And suddenly</p>
<p>people were like, oh, this is a beautiful creature and now we need to save the whales. And that</p>
<p>started the whole Save the Whales movement in the 70s. So as much as I, and I think a lot of people</p>
<p>want to believe that we care about consistent biological criteria, that&rsquo;s not historically</p>
<p>how we formed our alliances. Yeah, so what, why do we, why do we believe that all humans are created</p>
<p>equal? Killing of a human being, no matter who the human being is, that&rsquo;s what I meant by equality,</p>
<p>is bad. And then, because I&rsquo;m connecting that to robots and I&rsquo;m wondering whether mortality,</p>
<p>so the killing act is what makes something, that&rsquo;s the fundamental first right. So I am currently</p>
<p>allowed to take a shotgun and shoot a Roomba. I think, I&rsquo;m not sure, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>considered murder, right. Or even shutting them off. So that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s where the line appears to</p>
<p>be, right? Is this mortality a critical thing here? I think here again, like the animal analogy is</p>
<p>really useful because you&rsquo;re also allowed to shoot your dog, but people won&rsquo;t be happy about it.</p>
<p>So we give, we do give animals certain protections from like, you&rsquo;re not allowed to torture your dog</p>
<p>and set it on fire, at least in most states and countries, but you&rsquo;re still allowed to treat it</p>
<p>like a piece of property in a lot of other ways. And so we draw these arbitrary lines all the time.</p>
<p>And, you know, there&rsquo;s a lot of philosophical thought on why viewing humans as something unique</p>
<p>is not, is just speciesism and not, you know, based on any criteria that would actually justify</p>
<p>making a difference between us and other species. Do you think in general people, most people are</p>
<p>good? Do you think, or do you think there&rsquo;s evil and good in all of us? Is that&rsquo;s revealed through</p>
<p>our circumstances and through our interactions? I like to view myself as a person who like believes</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no absolute evil and good and that everything is, you know, gray. But I do think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an interesting question. Like when I see people being violent towards robotic objects, you said</p>
<p>that bothers you because the robots might someday, you know, be smart. And is that why?</p>
<p>Well, it bothers me because it reveals, so I personally believe, because I&rsquo;ve studied way too,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m Jewish. I studied the Holocaust and World War II exceptionally well. I personally believe</p>
<p>that most of us have evil in us. That what bothers me is the abuse of robots reveals the evil in</p>
<p>human beings. And it&rsquo;s, I think it doesn&rsquo;t just bother me. It&rsquo;s, I think it&rsquo;s an opportunity for</p>
<p>roboticists to make, help people find the better sides, the angels of their nature, right? That</p>
<p>abuse isn&rsquo;t just a fun side thing. That&rsquo;s a, you revealing a dark part that you shouldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>that should be hidden deep inside. Yeah. I mean, you laugh, but some of our research does indicate</p>
<p>that maybe people&rsquo;s behavior towards robots reveals something about their tendencies for</p>
<p>empathy generally, even using very simple robots that we have today that like clearly don&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>anything. So, you know, Westworld is maybe, you know, not so far off and it&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>depicting the bad characters as willing to go around and shoot and rape the robots and the good</p>
<p>characters is not wanting to do that. Even without assuming that the robots have consciousness.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a opportunity, it&rsquo;s interesting, there&rsquo;s opportunity to almost practice empathy.</p>
<p>The, on robots is an opportunity to practice empathy.</p>
<p>I agree with you. Some people would say, why are we practicing empathy on robots instead of,</p>
<p>you know, on our fellow humans or on animals that are actually alive and experienced the world?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t agree with them because I don&rsquo;t think empathy is a zero sum game. And I do</p>
<p>think that it&rsquo;s a muscle that you can train and that we should be doing that. But some people</p>
<p>disagree. So the interesting thing, you&rsquo;ve heard, you know, raising kids sort of asking them or</p>
<p>telling them to be nice to the smart speakers, to Alexa and so on, saying please and so on during</p>
<p>the requests. I don&rsquo;t know if, I&rsquo;m a huge fan of that idea because yeah, that&rsquo;s towards the idea of</p>
<p>practicing empathy. I feel like politeness, I&rsquo;m always polite to all the, all the systems that we</p>
<p>build, especially anything that&rsquo;s speech interaction based. Like when we talk to the car, I&rsquo;ll always</p>
<p>have a pretty good detector for please to, I feel like there should be a room for encouraging empathy</p>
<p>in those interactions. Yeah. Okay. So I agree with you. So I&rsquo;m going to play devil&rsquo;s advocate. Sure.</p>
<p>So what is the, what is the devil&rsquo;s advocate argument there? The devil&rsquo;s advocate argument</p>
<p>is that if you are the type of person who has abusive tendencies or needs to get some sort of</p>
<p>like behavior like that out, needs an outlet for it, that it&rsquo;s great to have a robot that you can</p>
<p>scream at so that you&rsquo;re not screaming at a person. And we just don&rsquo;t know whether that&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s an outlet for people or whether it just kind of, as my friend once said,</p>
<p>trains their cruelty muscles and makes them more cruel in other situations.</p>
<p>Oh boy. Yeah. And that expands to other topics, which I, I don&rsquo;t know, you know, there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a topic of sex, which is weird one that I tend to avoid it from robotics perspective.</p>
<p>And most of the general public doesn&rsquo;t, they talk about sex robots and so on. Is that an area you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>touched at all research wise? Like the way, cause that&rsquo;s what people imagine sort of any kind of</p>
<p>interaction between human and robot that shows any kind of compassion. They immediately think</p>
<p>from a product perspective in the near term is sort of expansion of what pornography is and all</p>
<p>that kind of stuff. Yeah. Do researchers touch this? Well that&rsquo;s kind of you to like characterize</p>
<p>it as though there&rsquo;s thinking rationally about product. I feel like sex robots are just such a</p>
<p>like titillating news hook for people that they become like the story. And it&rsquo;s really hard to</p>
<p>not get fatigued by it when you&rsquo;re in the space because you tell someone you do human robot</p>
<p>interaction. Of course, the first thing they want to talk about is sex robots. Yeah, it happens a</p>
<p>lot. And it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s unfortunate that I&rsquo;m so fatigued by it because I do think that there</p>
<p>are some interesting questions that become salient when you talk about, you know, sex with robots.</p>
<p>See what I think would happen when people get sex robots, like if it&rsquo;s some guys, okay, guys get</p>
<p>female sex robots. What I think there&rsquo;s an opportunity for is an actual, like, like they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>actually interact. What I&rsquo;m trying to say, they won&rsquo;t outside of the sex would be the most</p>
<p>fulfilling part. Like the interaction, it&rsquo;s like the folks who there&rsquo;s movies and this, right,</p>
<p>who pray, pay a prostitute and then end up just talking to her the whole time. So I feel like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an opportunity. It&rsquo;s like most guys and people in general joke about this, the sex act,</p>
<p>but really people are just lonely inside and they&rsquo;re looking for connection. Many of them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;d be unfortunate if that connection is established through the sex industry. I feel like</p>
<p>it should go into the front door of like, people are lonely and they want a connection.</p>
<p>Well, I also feel like we should kind of de, you know, de stigmatize the sex industry because,</p>
<p>you know, even prostitution, like there are prostitutes that specialize in disabled people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t have the same kind of opportunities to explore their sexuality. So it&rsquo;s, I feel like we</p>
<p>should like de stigmatize all of that generally. But yeah, that connection and that loneliness is</p>
<p>an interesting topic that you bring up because while people are constantly worried about robots</p>
<p>replacing humans and oh, if people get sex robots and the sex is really good, then they won&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>their, you know, partner or whatever. But we rarely talk about robots actually filling a hole where</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing and what benefit that can provide to people. Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s an exciting,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole giant, there&rsquo;s a giant hole that&rsquo;s unfillable by humans. It&rsquo;s asking too much of</p>
<p>your, of people, your friends and people you&rsquo;re in a relationship with in your family to fill that</p>
<p>hole. There&rsquo;s, because, you know, it&rsquo;s exploring the full, like, you know, exploring the full</p>
<p>complexity and richness of who you are. Like who are you really? Like people, your family doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have enough patience to really sit there and listen to who are you really. And I feel like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an opportunity to really make that connection with robots. I just feel like we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>complex as humans and we&rsquo;re capable of lots of different types of relationships. So whether that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you know, with family members, with friends, with our pets, or with robots, I feel like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s space for all of that and all of that can provide value in a different way.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely. So I&rsquo;m jumping around. Currently most of my work is in autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>So the most popular topic among the general public is the trolley problem. So most, most,</p>
<p>most roboticists kind of hate this question, but what do you think of this thought experiment?</p>
<p>What do you think we can learn from it outside of the silliness of</p>
<p>the actual application of it to the autonomous vehicle? I think it&rsquo;s still an interesting</p>
<p>ethical question. And that in itself, just like much of the interaction with robots</p>
<p>has something to teach us. But from your perspective, do you think there&rsquo;s anything there?</p>
<p>Well, I think you&rsquo;re right that it does have something to teach us because,</p>
<p>but I think what people are forgetting in all of these conversations is the origins of the trolley</p>
<p>problem and what it was meant to show us, which is that there is no right answer. And that sometimes</p>
<p>our moral intuition that comes to us instinctively is not actually what we should follow if we care</p>
<p>about creating systematic rules that apply to everyone. So I think that as a philosophical</p>
<p>concept, it could teach us at least that, but that&rsquo;s not how people are using it right now.</p>
<p>These are friends of mine and I love them dearly and their project adds a lot of value. But if</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re viewing the moral machine project as what we can learn from the trolley problems, the moral</p>
<p>machine is, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re familiar, it&rsquo;s this website that you can go to and it gives you</p>
<p>different scenarios like, oh, you&rsquo;re in a car, you can decide to run over these two people or</p>
<p>this child. What do you choose? Do you choose the homeless person? Do you choose the person who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>jaywalking? And so it pits these like moral choices against each other and then tries to</p>
<p>crowdsource the quote unquote correct answer, which is really interesting and I think valuable data,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s what we should base our rules in autonomous vehicles on because</p>
<p>it is exactly what the trolley problem is trying to show, which is your first instinct might not</p>
<p>be the correct one if you look at rules that then have to apply to everyone and everything.</p>
<p>So how do we encode these ethical choices in interaction with robots? For example,</p>
<p>autonomous vehicles, there is a serious ethical question of do I protect myself?</p>
<p>Does my life have higher priority than the life of another human being? Because that changes</p>
<p>certain control decisions that you make. So if your life matters more than other human beings,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;d be more likely to swerve out of your current lane. So currently automated emergency</p>
<p>braking systems that just brake, they don&rsquo;t ever swerve. So swerving into oncoming traffic or</p>
<p>no, just in a different lane can cause significant harm to others, but it&rsquo;s possible that it causes</p>
<p>less harm to you. So that&rsquo;s a difficult ethical question. Do you have a hope that</p>
<p>like the trolley problem is not supposed to have a right answer, right? Do you hope that</p>
<p>when we have robots at the table, we&rsquo;ll be able to discover the right answer for some of these</p>
<p>questions? Well, what&rsquo;s happening right now, I think, is this question that we&rsquo;re facing of</p>
<p>what ethical rules should we be programming into the machines is revealing to us that</p>
<p>our ethical rules are much less programmable than we probably thought before. And so that&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>valuable insight, I think, that these issues are very complicated and that in a lot of these cases,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you can&rsquo;t really make that call, like not even as a legislator. And so what&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>happen in reality, I think, is that car manufacturers are just going to try and avoid</p>
<p>the problem and avoid liability in any way possible. Or like they&rsquo;re going to always protect</p>
<p>the driver because who&rsquo;s going to buy a car if it&rsquo;s programmed to kill someone?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Kill you instead of someone else. So that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to happen in reality.</p>
<p>But what did you mean by like once we have robots at the table, like do you mean when they can help</p>
<p>us figure out what to do?</p>
<p>No, I mean when robots are part of the ethical decisions. So no, no, no, not they help us. Well.</p>
<p>Oh, you mean when it&rsquo;s like, should I run over a robot or a person?</p>
<p>Right. That kind of thing. So what, no, no, no. So when you, it&rsquo;s exactly what you said, which is</p>
<p>when you have to encode the ethics into an algorithm, you start to try to really understand</p>
<p>what are the fundamentals of the decision making process you make to make certain decisions.</p>
<p>Should you, like capital punishment, should you take a person&rsquo;s life or not to punish them for</p>
<p>a certain crime? Sort of, you can use, you can develop an algorithm to make that decision, right?</p>
<p>And the hope is that the act of making that algorithm, however you make it, so there&rsquo;s a few</p>
<p>approaches, will help us actually get to the core of what is right and what is wrong under our current</p>
<p>societal standards.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t that what&rsquo;s happening right now? And we&rsquo;re realizing that we don&rsquo;t have a consensus on</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s right and wrong.</p>
<p>You mean in politics in general?</p>
<p>Well, like when we&rsquo;re thinking about these trolley problems and autonomous vehicles and how to</p>
<p>program ethics into machines and how to, you know, make AI algorithms fair and equitable, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>realizing that this is so complicated and it&rsquo;s complicated in part because there doesn&rsquo;t seem</p>
<p>to be a one right answer in any of these cases.</p>
<p>Do you have a hope for, like one of the ideas of the moral machine is that crowdsourcing can help</p>
<p>us converge towards, like democracy can help us converge towards the right answer.</p>
<p>Do you have a hope for crowdsourcing?</p>
<p>Well, yes and no. So I think that in general, you know, I have a legal background and</p>
<p>policymaking is often about trying to suss out, you know, what rules does this particular society</p>
<p>agree on and then trying to codify that. So the law makes these choices all the time and then</p>
<p>tries to adapt according to changing culture. But in the case of the moral machine project,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that people&rsquo;s choices on that website necessarily reflect what laws they would</p>
<p>want in place. I think you would have to ask them a series of different questions in order to get</p>
<p>at what their consensus is.</p>
<p>I agree, but that has to do more with the artificial nature of, I mean, they&rsquo;re showing</p>
<p>some cute icons on a screen. That&rsquo;s almost, so if you, for example, we do a lot of work in virtual</p>
<p>reality. And so if you put those same people into virtual reality where they have to make that</p>
<p>decision, their decision would be very different, I think.</p>
<p>I agree with that. That&rsquo;s one aspect. And the other aspect is it&rsquo;s a different question to ask</p>
<p>someone, would you run over the homeless person or the doctor in this scene? Or do you want cars to</p>
<p>always run over the homeless people?</p>
<p>I think, yeah. So let&rsquo;s talk about anthropomorphism. To me, anthropomorphism, if I can</p>
<p>pronounce it correctly, is one of the most fascinating phenomena from like both the</p>
<p>engineering perspective and the psychology perspective, machine learning perspective,</p>
<p>and robotics in general. Can you step back and define anthropomorphism, how you see it in</p>
<p>general terms in your work?</p>
<p>Sure. So anthropomorphism is this tendency that we have to project human like traits and</p>
<p>behaviors and qualities onto nonhumans. And we often see it with animals, like we&rsquo;ll project</p>
<p>emotions on animals that may or may not actually be there. We often see that we&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>interpret things according to our own behavior when we get it wrong. But we do it with more</p>
<p>than just animals. We do it with objects, you know, teddy bears. We see, you know, faces in</p>
<p>the headlights of cars. And we do it with robots very, very extremely.</p>
<p>You think that can be engineered? Can that be used to enrich an interaction between an AI</p>
<p>system and the human?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>And do you see it being used that way often? Like, I don&rsquo;t, I haven&rsquo;t seen, whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Alexa or any of the smart speaker systems, often trying to optimize for the anthropomorphization.</p>
<p>You said you haven&rsquo;t seen?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen. They keep moving away from that. I think they&rsquo;re afraid of that.</p>
<p>They actually, so I only recently found out, but did you know that Amazon has like a whole</p>
<p>team of people who are just there to work on Alexa&rsquo;s personality?</p>
<p>So I know that depends on what you mean by personality. I didn&rsquo;t know that exact thing.</p>
<p>But I do know that how the voice is perceived is worked on a lot, whether if it&rsquo;s a pleasant</p>
<p>feeling about the voice, but that has to do more with the texture of the sound and the</p>
<p>audio and so on. But personality is more like&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what&rsquo;s her favorite beer when you ask her? And the personality team is different</p>
<p>for every country too. Like there&rsquo;s a different personality for German Alexa than there is</p>
<p>for American Alexa. That said, I think it&rsquo;s very difficult to, you know, use the, really,</p>
<p>really harness the anthropomorphism with these voice assistants because the voice interface</p>
<p>is still very primitive. And I think that in order to get people to really suspend their</p>
<p>disbelief and treat a robot like it&rsquo;s alive, less is sometimes more. You want them to project</p>
<p>onto the robot and you want the robot to not disappoint their expectations for how it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to answer or behave in order for them to have this kind of illusion. And with Alexa,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re there yet, or Siri, that they&rsquo;re just not good at that. But if you</p>
<p>look at some of the more animal like robots, like the baby seal that they use with the</p>
<p>dementia patients, it&rsquo;s a much more simple design. It doesn&rsquo;t try to talk to you. It</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t disappoint you in that way. It just makes little movements and sounds and people</p>
<p>stroke it and it responds to their touch. And that is like a very effective way to harness</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s tendency to kind of treat the robot like a living thing.</p>
<p>Yeah. So you bring up some interesting ideas in your paper chapter, I guess,</p>
<p>Anthropomorphic Framing Human Robot Interaction that I read the last time we scheduled this.</p>
<p>Oh my God, that was a long time ago.</p>
<p>Yeah. What are some good and bad cases of anthropomorphism in your perspective?</p>
<p>Like when is the good ones and bad?</p>
<p>Well, I should start by saying that, you know, while design can really enhance the</p>
<p>anthropomorphism, it doesn&rsquo;t take a lot to get people to treat a robot like it&rsquo;s alive. Like</p>
<p>people will, over 85% of Roombas have a name, which I&rsquo;m, I don&rsquo;t know the numbers for your</p>
<p>regular type of vacuum cleaner, but they&rsquo;re not that high, right? So people will feel bad for the</p>
<p>Roomba when it gets stuck, they&rsquo;ll send it in for repair and want to get the same one back. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, that one is not even designed to like make you do that. So I think that some of the cases</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s maybe a little bit concerning that anthropomorphism is happening is when you have</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s supposed to function like a tool and people are using it in the wrong way.</p>
<p>And one of the concerns is military robots where, so gosh, 2000, like early 2000s, which is a long</p>
<p>time ago, iRobot, the Roomba company made this robot called the Pacbot that was deployed in Iraq</p>
<p>and Afghanistan with the bomb disposal units that were there. And the soldiers became very emotionally</p>
<p>attached to the robots. And that&rsquo;s fine until a soldier risks his life to save a robot, which</p>
<p>you really don&rsquo;t want. But they were treating them like pets. Like they would name them,</p>
<p>they would give them funerals with gun salutes, they would get really upset and traumatized when</p>
<p>the robot got broken. So in situations where you want a robot to be a tool, in particular,</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s supposed to like do a dangerous job that you don&rsquo;t want a person doing,</p>
<p>it can be hard when people get emotionally attached to it. That&rsquo;s maybe something that</p>
<p>you would want to discourage. Another case for concern is maybe when companies try to</p>
<p>leverage the emotional attachment to exploit people. So if it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s not in the</p>
<p>consumer&rsquo;s interest, trying to like sell them products or services or exploit an emotional</p>
<p>connection to keep them paying for a cloud service for a social robot or something like that might be,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a little bit concerning as well.</p>
<p>Yeah, the emotional manipulation, which probably happens behind the scenes now with some like</p>
<p>social networks and so on, but making it more explicit. What&rsquo;s your favorite robot?</p>
<p>Fictional or real?</p>
<p>No, real. Real robot, which you have felt a connection with or not like, not anthropomorphic</p>
<p>connection, but I mean like you sit back and say, damn, this is an impressive system.</p>
<p>Wow. So two different robots. So the, the PLEO baby dinosaur robot that is no longer sold that</p>
<p>came out in 2007, that one I was very impressed with. It was, but, but from an anthropomorphic</p>
<p>perspective, I was impressed with how much I bonded with it, how much I like wanted to believe</p>
<p>that it had this inner life.</p>
<p>Can you describe PLEO, can you describe what it is? How big is it? What can it actually do?</p>
<p>Yeah. PLEO is about the size of a small cat. It had a lot of like motors that gave it this kind</p>
<p>of lifelike movement. It had things like touch sensors and an infrared camera. So it had all</p>
<p>these like cool little technical features, even though it was a toy. And the thing that really</p>
<p>struck me about it was that it, it could mimic pain and distress really well. So if you held</p>
<p>it up by the tail, it had a tilt sensor that, you know, told it what direction it was facing</p>
<p>and it would start to squirm and cry out. If you hit it too hard, it would start to cry.</p>
<p>So it was very impressive in design.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the second robot that you were, you said there might&rsquo;ve been two that you liked.</p>
<p>Yeah. So the Boston Dynamics robots are just impressive feats of engineering.</p>
<p>Have you met them in person?</p>
<p>Yeah. I recently got a chance to go visit and I, you know, I was always one of those people who</p>
<p>watched the videos and was like, this is super cool, but also it&rsquo;s a product video. Like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many times that they had to shoot this to get it right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But visiting them, I, you know, I&rsquo;m pretty sure that I was very impressed. Let&rsquo;s put it that way.</p>
<p>Yeah. And in terms of the control, I think that was a transformational moment for me</p>
<p>when I met Spot Mini in person.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because, okay, maybe this is a psychology experiment, but I anthropomorphized the,</p>
<p>the crap out of it. So I immediately, it was like my best friend, right?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really hard for anyone to watch Spot move and not feel like it has agency.</p>
<p>Yeah. This movement, especially the arm on Spot Mini really obviously looks like a head.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That they say, no, wouldn&rsquo;t mean it that way, but it obviously, it looks exactly like that.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s almost impossible to not think of it as a, almost like the baby dinosaur,</p>
<p>but slightly larger. And this movement of the, of course, the intelligence is,</p>
<p>their whole idea is that it&rsquo;s not supposed to be intelligent. It&rsquo;s a platform on which you build</p>
<p>higher intelligence. It&rsquo;s actually really, really dumb. It&rsquo;s just a basic movement platform.</p>
<p>Yeah. But even dumb robots can, like, we can immediately respond to them in this visceral way.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about Sophia the robot? This kind of mix of some basic natural language</p>
<p>processing and basically an art experiment.</p>
<p>Yeah. An art experiment is a good way to characterize it. I&rsquo;m much less impressed</p>
<p>with Sophia than I am with Boston Dynamics.</p>
<p>She said she likes you. She said she admires you.</p>
<p>Yeah. She followed me on Twitter at some point. Yeah.</p>
<p>She tweets about how much she likes you.</p>
<p>So what does that mean? I have to be nice or?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t know. I was emotionally manipulating you. No. How do you think of</p>
<p>that? I think of the whole thing that happened with Sophia is quite a large number of people</p>
<p>kind of immediately had a connection and thought that maybe we&rsquo;re far more advanced with robotics</p>
<p>than we are or actually didn&rsquo;t even think much. I was surprised how little people cared</p>
<p>that they kind of assumed that, well, of course AI can do this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then if they assume that, I felt they should be more impressed.</p>
<p>Well, people really overestimate where we are. And so when something, I don&rsquo;t even think Sophia</p>
<p>was very impressive or is very impressive. I think she&rsquo;s kind of a puppet, to be honest. But</p>
<p>yeah, I think people are a little bit influenced by science fiction and pop culture to</p>
<p>think that we should be further along than we are.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your favorite robots in movies and fiction?</p>
<p>WALLI.</p>
<p>WALLI. What do you like about WALLI? The humor, the cuteness, the perception control systems</p>
<p>operating on WALLI that makes it all work? Just in general?</p>
<p>The design of WALLI the robot, I think that animators figured out, starting in the 1940s,</p>
<p>how to create characters that don&rsquo;t look real, but look like something that&rsquo;s even better than real,</p>
<p>that we really respond to and think is really cute. They figured out how to make them move</p>
<p>and look in the right way. And WALLI is just such a great example of that.</p>
<p>You think eyes, big eyes or big something that&rsquo;s kind of eyeish. So it&rsquo;s always playing on some</p>
<p>aspect of the human face, right?</p>
<p>Often. Yeah. So big eyes. Well, I think one of the first animations to really play with this was</p>
<p>Bambi. And they weren&rsquo;t originally going to do that. They were originally trying to make the</p>
<p>deer look as lifelike as possible. They brought deer into the studio and had a little zoo there</p>
<p>so that the animators could work with them. And then at some point they were like,</p>
<p>if we make really big eyes and a small nose and big cheeks, kind of more like a baby face,</p>
<p>then people like it even better than if it looks real. Do you think the future of things like</p>
<p>Alexa in the home has possibility to take advantage of that, to build on that, to create</p>
<p>these systems that are better than real, that create a close human connection? I can pretty</p>
<p>much guarantee you without having any knowledge that those companies are going to make these</p>
<p>things. And companies are working on that design behind the scenes. I&rsquo;m pretty sure.</p>
<p>I totally disagree with you.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m interested in. I&rsquo;d like to build such a company. I know</p>
<p>a lot of those folks and they&rsquo;re afraid of that because how do you make money off of it?</p>
<p>Well, but even just making Alexa look a little bit more interesting than just a cylinder</p>
<p>would do so much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting thought, but I don&rsquo;t think people are from Amazon perspective are looking</p>
<p>for that kind of connection. They want you to be addicted to the services provided by Alexa,</p>
<p>not to the device. So the device itself, it&rsquo;s felt that you can lose a lot because if you create a</p>
<p>connection and then it creates more opportunity for frustration for negative stuff than it does</p>
<p>for positive stuff is I think the way they think about it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting. Like I agree that it&rsquo;s very difficult to get right and you have to get it</p>
<p>exactly right. Otherwise you wind up with Microsoft&rsquo;s Clippy.</p>
<p>Okay, easy now. What&rsquo;s your problem with Clippy?</p>
<p>You like Clippy? Is Clippy your friend?</p>
<p>Yeah, I like Clippy. I was just, I just talked to, we just had this argument and they said</p>
<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s CTO and they said, he said he&rsquo;s not bringing Clippy back. They&rsquo;re not bringing</p>
<p>Clippy back and that&rsquo;s very disappointing. I think it was Clippy was the greatest assistance</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve ever built. It was a horrible attempt, of course, but it&rsquo;s the best we&rsquo;ve ever done</p>
<p>because it was a real attempt to have like a actual personality. I mean, it was obviously</p>
<p>technology was way not there at the time of being able to be a recommender system for assisting you</p>
<p>in anything and typing in Word or any kind of other application, but still it was an attempt</p>
<p>of personality that was legitimate, which I thought was brave.</p>
<p>Yes, yes. Okay. You know, you&rsquo;ve convinced me I&rsquo;ll be slightly less hard on Clippy.</p>
<p>And I know I have like an army of people behind me who also miss Clippy.</p>
<p>Really? I want to meet these people. Who are these people?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the people who like to hate stuff when it&rsquo;s there and miss it when it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>So everyone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s everyone. Exactly. All right. So Enki and Jibo, the two companies,</p>
<p>the two amazing companies, the social robotics companies that have recently been closed down.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Why do you think it&rsquo;s so hard to create a personal robotics company? So making a business</p>
<p>out of essentially something that people would anthropomorphize, have a deep connection with.</p>
<p>Why is it so hard to make it work? Is the business case not there or what is it?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a number of different things. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to be this way forever.</p>
<p>I think at this current point in time, it takes so much work to build something that only barely</p>
<p>meets people&rsquo;s minimal expectations because of science fiction and pop culture giving people</p>
<p>this idea that we should be further than we already are. Like when people think about a robot</p>
<p>assistant in the home, they think about Rosie from the Jetsons or something like that. And</p>
<p>Enki and Jibo did such a beautiful job with the design and getting that interaction just right.</p>
<p>But I think people just wanted more. They wanted more functionality. I think you&rsquo;re also right that</p>
<p>the business case isn&rsquo;t really there because there hasn&rsquo;t been a killer application that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>useful enough to get people to adopt the technology in great numbers. I think what we did see from the</p>
<p>people who did get Jibo is a lot of them became very emotionally attached to it. But that&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of like the Palm Pilot back in the day. Most people are like, why do I need this?</p>
<p>Why would I? They don&rsquo;t see how they would benefit from it until they have it or some</p>
<p>other company comes in and makes it a little better. Yeah. Like how far away are we, do you</p>
<p>think? How hard is this problem? It&rsquo;s a good question. And I think it has a lot to do with</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s expectations and those keep shifting depending on what science fiction that is popular.</p>
<p>But also it&rsquo;s two things. It&rsquo;s people&rsquo;s expectation and people&rsquo;s need for an emotional</p>
<p>connection. Yeah. And I believe the need is pretty high. Yes. But I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re aware of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. There&rsquo;s like, I really think this is like the life as we know it. So we&rsquo;ve just kind</p>
<p>of gotten used to it of really, I hate to be dark because I have close friends, but we&rsquo;ve gotten</p>
<p>used to really never being close to anyone. Right. And we&rsquo;re deeply, I believe, okay, this is</p>
<p>hypothesis. I think we&rsquo;re deeply lonely, all of us, even those in deep fulfilling relationships.</p>
<p>In fact, what makes those relationship fulfilling, I think is that they at least tap into that deep</p>
<p>loneliness a little bit. But I feel like there&rsquo;s more opportunity to explore that, that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>inter, doesn&rsquo;t interfere with the human relationships you have. It expands more on the,</p>
<p>that, yeah, the rich deep unexplored complexity that&rsquo;s all of us, weird apes. Okay.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right. Do you think it&rsquo;s possible to fall in love with a robot?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, totally. Do you think it&rsquo;s possible to have a longterm committed monogamous relationship</p>
<p>with a robot? Well, yeah, there are lots of different types of longterm committed monogamous</p>
<p>relationships. I think monogamous implies like, you&rsquo;re not going to see other humans sexually or</p>
<p>like you basically on Facebook have to say, I&rsquo;m in a relationship with this person, this robot.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t like, again, I think this is comparing robots to humans when I would rather</p>
<p>compare them to pets. Like you get a robot, it fulfills this loneliness that you have</p>
<p>in maybe not the same way as a pet, maybe in a different way that is even supplemental in a</p>
<p>different way. But I&rsquo;m not saying that people won&rsquo;t like do this, be like, oh, I want to marry</p>
<p>my robot or I want to have like a sexual relation, monogamous relationship with my robot. But I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that that&rsquo;s the main use case for them. But you think that there&rsquo;s still a gap between</p>
<p>human and pet. So between a husband and pet, there&rsquo;s a different relationship. It&rsquo;s engineering.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a gap that can be closed through. I think it could be closed someday, but why</p>
<p>would we close that? Like, I think it&rsquo;s so boring to think about recreating things that we already</p>
<p>have when we could create something that&rsquo;s different. I know you&rsquo;re thinking about the</p>
<p>people who like don&rsquo;t have a husband and like, what could we give them? Yeah. But I guess what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting at is maybe not. So like the movie Her. Yeah. Right. So a better husband. Well,</p>
<p>maybe better in some ways. Like it&rsquo;s, I do think that robots are going to continue to be a different</p>
<p>type of relationship, even if we get them like very human looking or when, you know, the voice</p>
<p>interactions we have with them feel very like natural and human like, I think there&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>going to be differences. And there were in that movie too, like towards the end, it kind of goes</p>
<p>off the rails. But it&rsquo;s just a movie. So your intuition is that, because you kind of said</p>
<p>two things, right? So one is why would you want to basically replicate the husband? Yeah. Right.</p>
<p>And the other is kind of implying that it&rsquo;s kind of hard to do. So like anytime you try,</p>
<p>you might build something very impressive, but it&rsquo;ll be different. I guess my question is about</p>
<p>human nature. It&rsquo;s like, how hard is it to satisfy that role of the husband? So we&rsquo;re moving any of</p>
<p>the sexual stuff aside is the, it&rsquo;s more like the mystery, the tension, the dance of relationships</p>
<p>you think with robots, that&rsquo;s difficult to build. What&rsquo;s your intuition? I think that, well, it also</p>
<p>depends on are we talking about robots now in 50 years in like indefinite amount of time. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking like five or 10 years. Five or 10 years. I think that robots at best will be like, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more similar to the relationship we have with our pets than relationship that we have with other</p>
<p>people. I got it. So what do you think it takes to build a system that exhibits greater and greater</p>
<p>levels of intelligence? Like it impresses us with this intelligence. Arumba, so you talk about</p>
<p>anthropomorphization that doesn&rsquo;t, I think intelligence is not required. In fact, intelligence</p>
<p>probably gets in the way sometimes, like you mentioned. But what do you think it takes to</p>
<p>create a system where we sense that it has a human level intelligence? So something that,</p>
<p>probably something conversational, human level intelligence. How hard do you think that problem</p>
<p>is? It&rsquo;d be interesting to sort of hear your perspective, not just purely, so I talk to a lot</p>
<p>of people, how hard is the conversational agents? How hard is it to pass the torrent test? But my</p>
<p>sense is it&rsquo;s easier than just solving, it&rsquo;s easier than solving the pure natural language</p>
<p>processing problem. Because I feel like you can cheat. Yeah. So how hard is it to pass the torrent</p>
<p>test in your view? Well, I think again, it&rsquo;s all about expectation management. If you set up</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s expectations to think that they&rsquo;re communicating with, what was it, a 13 year old</p>
<p>boy from the Ukraine? Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. Then they&rsquo;re not going to expect perfect English,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not going to expect perfect, you know, understanding of concepts or even like being on</p>
<p>the same wavelength in terms of like conversation flow. So it&rsquo;s much easier to pass in that case.</p>
<p>Do you think, you kind of alluded this too with audio, do you think it needs to have a body?</p>
<p>I think that we definitely have, so we treat physical things with more social agency,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re very physical creatures. I think a body can be useful.</p>
<p>Does it get in the way? Is there a negative aspects like&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, there can be. So if you&rsquo;re trying to create a body that&rsquo;s too similar to something that people</p>
<p>are familiar with, like I have this robot cat at home that has robots. I have a robot cat at home</p>
<p>that has roommates. And it&rsquo;s very disturbing to watch because I&rsquo;m constantly assuming that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to move like a real cat and it doesn&rsquo;t because it&rsquo;s like a $100 piece of technology.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very like disappointing and it&rsquo;s very hard to treat it like it&rsquo;s alive. So you can get a lot</p>
<p>wrong with the body too, but you can also use tricks, same as, you know, the expectation</p>
<p>management of the 13 year old boy from the Ukraine. If you pick an animal that people</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t intimately familiar with, like the baby dinosaur, like the baby seal that people have</p>
<p>never actually held in their arms, you can get away with much more because they don&rsquo;t have these</p>
<p>preformed expectations. Yeah, I remember you thinking of a Ted talk or something that clicked</p>
<p>for me that nobody actually knows what a dinosaur looks like. So you can actually get away with a</p>
<p>lot more. That was great. So what do you think about consciousness and mortality</p>
<p>being displayed in a robot? So not actually having consciousness, but having these kind</p>
<p>of human elements that are much more than just the interaction, much more than just,</p>
<p>like you mentioned with a dinosaur moving kind of in an interesting ways, but really being worried</p>
<p>about its own death and really acting as if it&rsquo;s aware and self aware and identity. Have you seen</p>
<p>that done in robotics? What do you think about doing that? Is that a powerful good thing?</p>
<p>Well, I think it can be a design tool that you can use for different purposes. So I can&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s inherently good or bad, but I do think it can be a powerful tool. The fact that the</p>
<p>pleo mimics distress when you quote unquote hurt it is a really powerful tool to get people to</p>
<p>engage with it in a certain way. I had a research partner that I did some of the empathy work with</p>
<p>named Palash Nandi and he had built a robot for himself that had like a lifespan and that would</p>
<p>stop working after a certain amount of time just because he was interested in whether he himself</p>
<p>would treat it differently. And we know from Tamagotchis, those little games that we used to</p>
<p>have that were extremely primitive, that people respond to this idea of mortality and you can get</p>
<p>people to do a lot with little design tricks like that. Now, whether it&rsquo;s a good thing depends on</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re trying to get them to do. Have a deeper relationship, have a deeper connection,</p>
<p>sign a relationship. If it&rsquo;s for their own benefit, that sounds great. Okay. You could do that for a</p>
<p>lot of other reasons. I see. So what kind of stuff are you worried about? So is it mostly about</p>
<p>manipulation of your emotions for like advertisement and so on, things like that? Yeah, or data</p>
<p>collection or, I mean, you could think of governments misusing this to extract information</p>
<p>from people. It&rsquo;s, you know, just like any other technological tool, it just raises a lot of</p>
<p>questions. If you look at Facebook, if you look at Twitter and social networks, there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of concern of data collection now. What&rsquo;s from the legal perspective or in general,</p>
<p>how do we prevent the violation of sort of these companies crossing a line? It&rsquo;s a great area,</p>
<p>but crossing a line, they shouldn&rsquo;t in terms of manipulating, like we&rsquo;re talking about and</p>
<p>manipulating our emotion, manipulating our behavior, using tactics that are not so savory.</p>
<p>Yeah. It&rsquo;s really difficult because we are starting to create technology that relies on</p>
<p>data collection to provide functionality. And there&rsquo;s not a lot of incentive,</p>
<p>even on the consumer side, to curb that because the other problem is that the harms aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>tangible. They&rsquo;re not really apparent to a lot of people because they kind of trickle down on a</p>
<p>societal level. And then suddenly we&rsquo;re living in like 1984, which, you know, sounds extreme,</p>
<p>but that book was very prescient and I&rsquo;m not worried about, you know, these systems. I have,</p>
<p>you know, Amazon&rsquo;s Echo at home and tell Alexa all sorts of stuff. And it helps me because,</p>
<p>you know, Alexa knows what brand of diaper we use. And so I can just easily order it again.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t have any incentive to ask a lawmaker to curb that. But when I think about that data</p>
<p>then being used against low income people to target them for scammy loans or education programs,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s then a societal effect that I think is very severe and, you know,</p>
<p>legislators should be thinking about.</p>
<p>But yeah, the gray area is the removing ourselves from consideration of like,</p>
<p>of explicitly defining objectives and more saying,</p>
<p>well, we want to maximize engagement in our social network.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then just, because you&rsquo;re not actually doing a bad thing. It makes sense. You want people to</p>
<p>keep a conversation going, to have more conversations, to keep coming back</p>
<p>again and again, to have conversations. And whatever happens after that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind of not exactly directly responsible. You&rsquo;re only indirectly responsible. So I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really hard problem. Are you optimistic about us ever being able to solve it?</p>
<p>You mean the problem of capitalism? It&rsquo;s like, because the problem is that the companies</p>
<p>are acting in the company&rsquo;s interests and not in people&rsquo;s interests. And when those interests are</p>
<p>aligned, that&rsquo;s great. But the completely free market doesn&rsquo;t seem to work because of this</p>
<p>information asymmetry.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s hard to know how to, so say you were trying to do the right thing. I guess what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to say is it&rsquo;s not obvious for these companies what the good thing for society is to</p>
<p>do. Like, I don&rsquo;t think they sit there with, I don&rsquo;t know, with a glass of wine and a cat,</p>
<p>like petting a cat, evil cat. And there&rsquo;s two decisions and one of them is good for society.</p>
<p>One is good for the profit and they choose the profit. I think they actually, there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>money to be made by doing the right thing for society. Because Google, Facebook have so much cash</p>
<p>that they actually, especially Facebook, would significantly benefit from making decisions that</p>
<p>are good for society. It&rsquo;s good for their brand. But I don&rsquo;t know if they know what&rsquo;s good for</p>
<p>society. I don&rsquo;t think we know what&rsquo;s good for society in terms of how we manage the</p>
<p>conversation on Twitter or how we design, we&rsquo;re talking about robots. Like, should we</p>
<p>emotionally manipulate you into having a deep connection with Alexa or not?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. Do you have optimism that we&rsquo;ll be able to solve some of these questions?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m going to say something that&rsquo;s controversial, like in my circles,</p>
<p>which is that I don&rsquo;t think that companies who are reaching out to ethicists and trying to create</p>
<p>interdisciplinary ethics boards, I don&rsquo;t think that that&rsquo;s totally just trying to whitewash</p>
<p>the problem and so that they look like they&rsquo;ve done something. I think that a lot of companies</p>
<p>actually do, like you say, care about what the right answer is. They don&rsquo;t know what that is,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re trying to find people to help them find them. Not in every case, but I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s much too easy to just vilify the companies as, like you say, sitting there with their cat</p>
<p>going, her, her, her, $1 million. That&rsquo;s not what happens. A lot of people are well meaning even</p>
<p>within companies. I think that what we do absolutely need is more interdisciplinarity,</p>
<p>both within companies, but also within the policymaking space because we&rsquo;ve hurtled into</p>
<p>the world where technological progress is much faster, it seems much faster than it was, and</p>
<p>things are getting very complex. And you need people who understand the technology, but also</p>
<p>people who understand what the societal implications are, and people who are thinking</p>
<p>about this in a more systematic way to be talking to each other. There&rsquo;s no other solution, I think.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve also done work on intellectual property, so if you look at the algorithms that these</p>
<p>companies are using, like YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, so on, I mean that&rsquo;s kind of,</p>
<p>those are mostly secretive. The recommender systems behind these algorithms. Do you think</p>
<p>about an IP and the transparency of algorithms like this? Like what is the responsibility of</p>
<p>these companies to open source the algorithms or at least reveal to the public how these</p>
<p>algorithms work? So I personally don&rsquo;t work on that. There are a lot of people who do though,</p>
<p>and there are a lot of people calling for transparency. In fact, Europe&rsquo;s even trying</p>
<p>to legislate transparency, maybe they even have at this point, where like if an algorithmic system</p>
<p>makes some sort of decision that affects someone&rsquo;s life, that you need to be able to see how that</p>
<p>decision was made. It&rsquo;s a tricky balance because obviously companies need to have some sort of</p>
<p>competitive advantage and you can&rsquo;t take all of that away or you stifle innovation. But yeah,</p>
<p>for some of the ways that these systems are already being used, I think it is pretty important that</p>
<p>people understand how they work. What are your thoughts in general on intellectual property in</p>
<p>this weird age of software, AI, robotics? Oh, that it&rsquo;s broken. I mean, the system is just broken. So</p>
<p>can you describe, I actually, I don&rsquo;t even know what intellectual property is in the space of</p>
<p>software, what it means to, I mean, so I believe I have a patent on a piece of software from my PhD.</p>
<p>You believe? You don&rsquo;t know? No, we went through a whole process. Yeah, I do. You get the spam</p>
<p>emails like, we&rsquo;ll frame your patent for you. Yeah, it&rsquo;s much like a thesis. But that&rsquo;s useless,</p>
<p>right? Or not? Where does IP stand in this age? What&rsquo;s the right way to do it? What&rsquo;s the right</p>
<p>way to protect and own ideas when it&rsquo;s just code and this mishmash of something that feels much</p>
<p>softer than a piece of machinery? Yeah. I mean, it&rsquo;s hard because there are different types of</p>
<p>intellectual property and they&rsquo;re kind of these blunt instruments. It&rsquo;s like patent law is like</p>
<p>a wrench. It works really well for an industry like the pharmaceutical industry. But when you</p>
<p>try and apply it to something else, it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;ll just hit this thing with a wrench</p>
<p>and hope it works. So software, you have a couple of different options. Any code that&rsquo;s written down</p>
<p>in some tangible form is automatically copyrighted. So you have that protection, but that doesn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>much because if someone takes the basic idea that the code is executing and just does it in a</p>
<p>slightly different way, they can get around the copyright. So that&rsquo;s not a lot of protection.</p>
<p>Then you can patent software, but that&rsquo;s kind of, I mean, getting a patent costs,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you remember what yours cost or like, was it through an institution?</p>
<p>Yeah, it was through a university. It was insane. There were so many lawyers, so many meetings.</p>
<p>It made me feel like it must&rsquo;ve been hundreds of thousands of dollars. It must&rsquo;ve been something</p>
<p>crazy. Oh yeah. It&rsquo;s insane the cost of getting a patent. And so this idea of protecting the</p>
<p>inventor in their own garage who came up with a great idea is kind of, that&rsquo;s the thing of the</p>
<p>past. It&rsquo;s all just companies trying to protect things and it costs a lot of money. And then</p>
<p>with code, it&rsquo;s oftentimes by the time the patent is issued, which can take like five years,</p>
<p>probably your code is obsolete at that point. So it&rsquo;s a very, again, a very blunt instrument that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work well for that industry. And so at this point we should really have something better,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t. Do you like open source? Yeah. Is open source good for society?</p>
<p>You think all of us should open source code? Well, so at the Media Lab at MIT, we have an</p>
<p>open source default because what we&rsquo;ve noticed is that people will come in, they&rsquo;ll write some code</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll be like, how do I protect this? And we&rsquo;re like, that&rsquo;s not your problem right now.</p>
<p>Your problem isn&rsquo;t that someone&rsquo;s going to steal your project. Your problem is getting people to</p>
<p>use it at all. There&rsquo;s so much stuff out there. We don&rsquo;t even know if you&rsquo;re going to get traction</p>
<p>for your work. And so open sourcing can sometimes help, you know, get people&rsquo;s work out there,</p>
<p>but ensure that they get attribution for it, for the work that they&rsquo;ve done. So like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a fan of it in a lot of contexts. Obviously it&rsquo;s not like a one size fits all solution.</p>
<p>So what I gleaned from your Twitter is, you&rsquo;re a mom. I saw a quote, a reference to baby bot.</p>
<p>What have you learned about robotics and AI from raising a human baby bot?</p>
<p>Well, I think that my child has made it more apparent to me that the systems we&rsquo;re currently</p>
<p>creating aren&rsquo;t like human intelligence. Like there&rsquo;s not a lot to compare there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, he has learned and developed in such a different way than a lot of the AI systems</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re creating that that&rsquo;s not really interesting to me to compare. But what is interesting to me</p>
<p>is how these systems are going to shape the world that he grows up in. And so I&rsquo;m like even more</p>
<p>concerned about kind of the societal effects of developing systems that, you know, rely on</p>
<p>massive amounts of data collection, for example. So is he going to be allowed to use like Facebook or</p>
<p>Facebook? Facebook is over. Kids don&rsquo;t use that anymore. Snapchat. What do they use? Instagram?</p>
<p>Snapchat&rsquo;s over too. I don&rsquo;t know. I just heard that TikTok is over, which I&rsquo;ve never even seen.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know. No. We&rsquo;re old. We don&rsquo;t know. I need to, I&rsquo;m going to start gaming and streaming</p>
<p>my, my gameplay. So what do you see as the future of personal robotics, social robotics, interaction</p>
<p>with other robots? Like what are you excited about if you were to sort of philosophize about what</p>
<p>might happen in the next five, 10 years that would be cool to see? Oh, I really hope that we get kind</p>
<p>of a home robot that makes it, that&rsquo;s a social robot and not just Alexa. Like it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>I really love the Anki products. I thought Jibo was, had some really great aspects. So I&rsquo;m hoping</p>
<p>that a company cracks that. Me too. So Kate, it was a wonderful talking to you today. Likewise.</p>
