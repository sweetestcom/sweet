    <p>By the time he gets to 2045,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be able to multiply our intelligence</p>
<p>many millions fold.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just very hard to imagine what that will be like.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Ray Kurzweil,</p>
<p>author, inventor, and futurist,</p>
<p>who has an optimistic view of our future</p>
<p>as a human civilization,</p>
<p>predicting that exponentially improving technologies</p>
<p>will take us to a point of a singularity</p>
<p>beyond which superintelligent artificial intelligence</p>
<p>will transform our world in nearly unimaginable ways.</p>
<p>18 years ago, in the book Singularity is Near,</p>
<p>he predicted that the onset of the singularity</p>
<p>will happen in the year 2045.</p>
<p>He still holds to this prediction and estimate.</p>
<p>In fact, he&rsquo;s working on a new book on this topic</p>
<p>that will hopefully be out next year.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Ray Kurzweil.</p>
<p>In your 2005 book titled The Singularity is Near,</p>
<p>you predicted that the singularity will happen in 2045.</p>
<p>So now, 18 years later, do you still estimate</p>
<p>that the singularity will happen on 2045?</p>
<p>And maybe first, what is the singularity,</p>
<p>the technological singularity, and when will it happen?</p>
<p>Singularity is where computers really change our view</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s important and change who we are.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re getting close to some salient things</p>
<p>that will change who we are.</p>
<p>A key thing is 2029,</p>
<p>when computers will pass the Turing test.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also some controversy</p>
<p>whether the Turing test is valid.</p>
<p>I believe it is.</p>
<p>Most people do believe that,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some controversy about that.</p>
<p>But Stanford got very alarmed at my prediction about 2029.</p>
<p>I made this in 1999 in my book.</p>
<p>The Age of Spiritual Machines.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And then you repeated the prediction in 2005.</p>
<p>In 2005.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So they held an international conference,</p>
<p>you might have been aware of it,</p>
<p>of AI experts in 1999 to assess this view.</p>
<p>So people gave different predictions,</p>
<p>and they took a poll.</p>
<p>It was really the first time that AI experts worldwide</p>
<p>were polled on this prediction.</p>
<p>And the average poll was 100 years.</p>
<p>20% believed it would never happen.</p>
<p>And that was the view in 1999.</p>
<p>80% believed it would happen,</p>
<p>but not within their lifetimes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been so many advances in AI</p>
<p>that the poll of AI experts has come down over the years.</p>
<p>So a year ago, something called Meticulous,</p>
<p>which you may be aware of,</p>
<p>assesses different types of experts on the future.</p>
<p>They again assessed what AI experts then felt.</p>
<p>And they were saying 2042.</p>
<p>For the Turing test.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s coming down.</p>
<p>And I was still saying 2029.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, they again did another poll,</p>
<p>and it was 2030.</p>
<p>So AI experts now basically agree with me.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t changed at all, I&rsquo;ve stayed with 2029.</p>
<p>And AI experts now agree with me,</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t agree at first.</p>
<p>So Alan Turing formulated the Turing test,</p>
<p>and&hellip;</p>
<p>Right, now, what he said was very little about it.</p>
<p>I mean, the 1950 paper</p>
<p>where he had articulated the Turing test,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a few lines that talk about the Turing test.</p>
<p>And it really wasn&rsquo;t very clear how to administer it.</p>
<p>And he said if they did it in like 15 minutes,</p>
<p>that would be sufficient,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t really think is the case.</p>
<p>These large language models now,</p>
<p>some people are convinced by it already.</p>
<p>I mean, you can talk to it and have a conversation with it.</p>
<p>You can actually talk to it for hours.</p>
<p>So it requires a little more depth.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some problems with large language models</p>
<p>which we can talk about.</p>
<p>But some people are convinced by the Turing test.</p>
<p>Now, if somebody passes the Turing test,</p>
<p>what are the implications of that?</p>
<p>Does that mean that they&rsquo;re sentient,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re conscious or not?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not necessarily clear what the implications are.</p>
<p>Anyway, I believe 2029, that&rsquo;s six, seven years from now,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll have something that passes the Turing test</p>
<p>and a valid Turing test,</p>
<p>meaning it goes for hours, not just a few minutes.</p>
<p>Can you speak to that a little bit?</p>
<p>What is your formulation of the Turing test?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve proposed a very difficult version</p>
<p>of the Turing test, so what does that look like?</p>
<p>Basically, it&rsquo;s just to assess it over several hours</p>
<p>and also have a human judge that&rsquo;s fairly sophisticated</p>
<p>on what computers can do and can&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>If you take somebody who&rsquo;s not that sophisticated</p>
<p>or even an average engineer,</p>
<p>they may not really assess various aspects of it.</p>
<p>So you really want the human to challenge the system.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>On its ability to do things</p>
<p>like common sense reasoning, perhaps.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually a key problem with large language models.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t do these kinds of tests</p>
<p>that would involve assessing chains of reasoning,</p>
<p>but you can lose track of that.</p>
<p>If you talk to them,</p>
<p>they actually can talk to you pretty well</p>
<p>and you can be convinced by it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s somebody that would really convince you</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a human, whatever that takes.</p>
<p>Maybe it would take days or weeks,</p>
<p>but it would really convince you that it&rsquo;s human.</p>
<p>Large language models can appear that way.</p>
<p>You can read conversations and they appear pretty good.</p>
<p>There are some problems with it.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t do math very well.</p>
<p>You can ask how many legs did 10 elephants have</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll tell you, well, okay,</p>
<p>each elephant has four legs</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s 10 elephants, so it&rsquo;s 40 legs.</p>
<p>And you go, okay, that&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>How many legs do 11 elephants have?</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t seem to understand the question.</p>
<p>Do all humans understand that question?</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s the key thing.</p>
<p>I mean, how advanced a human do you want it to be?</p>
<p>But we do expect a human</p>
<p>to be able to do multi chain reasoning,</p>
<p>to be able to take a few facts</p>
<p>and put them together, not perfectly.</p>
<p>And we see that in a lot of polls</p>
<p>that people don&rsquo;t do that perfectly at all.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not very well defined,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s something where it really would convince you</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a human.</p>
<p>Is your intuition that large language models</p>
<p>will not be solely the kind of system</p>
<p>that passes the Turing test in 2029?</p>
<p>Do we need something else?</p>
<p>No, I think it will be a large language model,</p>
<p>but they have to go beyond what they&rsquo;re doing now.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re getting there.</p>
<p>And another key issue is if somebody</p>
<p>actually passes the Turing test validly,</p>
<p>I would believe they&rsquo;re conscious.</p>
<p>And then not everybody would say that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay, we can pass the Turing test,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t really believe that it&rsquo;s conscious.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a whole nother issue.</p>
<p>But if it really passes the Turing test,</p>
<p>I would believe that it&rsquo;s conscious.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t believe that of large language models today.</p>
<p>If it appears to be conscious,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s as good as being conscious, at least for you,</p>
<p>in some sense.</p>
<p>I mean, consciousness is not something that&rsquo;s scientific.</p>
<p>I mean, I believe you&rsquo;re conscious,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really just a belief,</p>
<p>and we believe that about other humans</p>
<p>that at least appear to be conscious.</p>
<p>When you go outside of shared human assumption,</p>
<p>like are animals conscious?</p>
<p>Some people believe they&rsquo;re not conscious.</p>
<p>Some people believe they are conscious.</p>
<p>And would a machine that acts just like a human be conscious?</p>
<p>I mean, I believe it would be.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s really a philosophical belief.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t prove it.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t take an entity and prove that it&rsquo;s conscious.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing that you can do</p>
<p>that would indicate that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like saying a piece of art is beautiful.</p>
<p>You can say it.</p>
<p>Multiple people can experience a piece of art as beautiful,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t prove it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also an extremely important issue.</p>
<p>I mean, imagine if you had something</p>
<p>where nobody&rsquo;s conscious.</p>
<p>The world may as well not exist.</p>
<p>And so some people, like say Marvin Minsky,</p>
<p>said, well, consciousness is not logical,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not scientific, and therefore we should dismiss it,</p>
<p>and any talk about consciousness is just not to be believed.</p>
<p>But when he actually engaged with somebody</p>
<p>who was conscious, he actually acted</p>
<p>as if they were conscious.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t ignore that.</p>
<p>He acted as if consciousness does matter.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Whereas he said it didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s Marvin Minsky.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s full of contradictions.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s true of a lot of people as well.</p>
<p>But to you, consciousness matters.</p>
<p>But to me, it&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>But I would say it&rsquo;s not a scientific issue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a philosophical issue.</p>
<p>And people have different views.</p>
<p>Some people believe that anything</p>
<p>that makes a decision is conscious.</p>
<p>So your light switch is conscious.</p>
<p>Its level of consciousness is low,</p>
<p>not very interesting, but that&rsquo;s a consciousness.</p>
<p>So a computer that makes a more interesting decision</p>
<p>is still not at human levels,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also conscious and at a higher level</p>
<p>than your light switch.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one view.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many different views of what consciousness is.</p>
<p>So if a system passes the Turing test,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not scientific, but in issues of philosophy,</p>
<p>things like ethics start to enter the picture.</p>
<p>Do you think there would be,</p>
<p>we would start contending as a human species</p>
<p>about the ethics of turning off such a machine?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that&rsquo;s definitely come up.</p>
<p>Hasn&rsquo;t come up in reality yet.</p>
<p>Yet.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m talking about 2029.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that many years from now.</p>
<p>So what are our obligations to it?</p>
<p>It has a different, I mean, a computer that&rsquo;s conscious,</p>
<p>it has a little bit different connotations than a human.</p>
<p>We have a continuous consciousness.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in an entity that does not last forever.</p>
<p>Now, actually, a significant portion of humans still exist</p>
<p>and are therefore still conscious.</p>
<p>But anybody who is over a certain age</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore.</p>
<p>That wouldn&rsquo;t be true of a computer program.</p>
<p>You could completely turn it off</p>
<p>and a copy of it could be stored and you could recreate it.</p>
<p>And so it has a different type of validity.</p>
<p>You could actually take it back in time.</p>
<p>You could eliminate its memory and have it go over again.</p>
<p>I mean, it has a different kind of connotation</p>
<p>than humans do.</p>
<p>Well, perhaps it can do the same thing with humans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that we don&rsquo;t know how to do that yet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that we figure out all of these things</p>
<p>on the machine first.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean the machine isn&rsquo;t conscious.</p>
<p>I mean, if you look at the way people react,</p>
<p>say, 3CPO or other machines that are conscious in movies,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t actually present how it&rsquo;s conscious,</p>
<p>but we see that they are a machine</p>
<p>and people will believe that they are conscious</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll actually worry about it</p>
<p>if they get into trouble and so on.</p>
<p>So 2029 is going to be the first year</p>
<p>when a major thing happens.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And that will shake our civilization</p>
<p>to start to consider the role of AI in this world.</p>
<p>Yes and no.</p>
<p>I mean, this one guy at Google claimed</p>
<p>that the machine was conscious.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just one person.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>When it starts to happen to scale.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s exactly right because most people</p>
<p>have not taken that position.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t take that position.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve used different things like this</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t appear to me to be conscious.</p>
<p>As we eliminate various problems</p>
<p>of these large language models,</p>
<p>more and more people will accept that they&rsquo;re conscious.</p>
<p>So when we get to 2029, I think a large fraction</p>
<p>of people will believe that they&rsquo;re conscious.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not gonna happen all at once.</p>
<p>I believe it will actually happen gradually</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s already started to happen.</p>
<p>And so that takes us one step closer to the singularity.</p>
<p>Another step then is in the 2030s</p>
<p>when we can actually connect our neocortex,</p>
<p>which is where we do our thinking, to computers.</p>
<p>And I mean, just as this actually gains a lot</p>
<p>to being connected to computers</p>
<p>that will amplify its abilities,</p>
<p>I mean, if this did not have any connection,</p>
<p>it would be pretty stupid.</p>
<p>It could not answer any of your questions.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re just listening to this, by the way,</p>
<p>Ray&rsquo;s holding up the all powerful smartphone.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna do that directly from our brains.</p>
<p>I mean, these are pretty good.</p>
<p>These already have amplified our intelligence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m already much smarter than I would otherwise be</p>
<p>if I didn&rsquo;t have this.</p>
<p>Because I remember my first book,</p>
<p>The Age of Intelligent Machines,</p>
<p>there was no way to get information from computers.</p>
<p>I actually would go to a library, find a book,</p>
<p>find the page that had an information I wanted,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d go to the copier,</p>
<p>and my most significant information tool</p>
<p>was a roll of quarters where I could feed the copier.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re already greatly advanced</p>
<p>that we have these things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few problems with it.</p>
<p>First of all, I constantly put it down,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t remember where I put it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually never lost it.</p>
<p>But you have to find it, and then you have to turn it on.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a certain amount of steps.</p>
<p>It would actually be quite useful</p>
<p>if someone would just listen to your conversation</p>
<p>and say, oh, that&rsquo;s so and so actress,</p>
<p>and tell you what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>So going from active to passive,</p>
<p>where it just permeates your whole life.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>The way your brain does when you&rsquo;re awake.</p>
<p>Your brain is always there.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that could actually</p>
<p>just about be done today,</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;d listen to your conversation,</p>
<p>understand what you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>understand what you&rsquo;re not missing,</p>
<p>and give you that information.</p>
<p>But another step is to actually go inside your brain.</p>
<p>And there are some prototypes</p>
<p>where you can connect your brain.</p>
<p>They actually don&rsquo;t have the amount</p>
<p>of bandwidth that we need.</p>
<p>They can work, but they work fairly slowly.</p>
<p>So if it actually would connect to your neocortex,</p>
<p>and the neocortex, which I describe</p>
<p>in How to Create a Mind,</p>
<p>the neocortex is actually,</p>
<p>it has different levels,</p>
<p>and as you go up the levels,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like a pyramid.</p>
<p>The top level is fairly small,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the level where you wanna connect</p>
<p>these brain extenders.</p>
<p>And so I believe that will happen in the 2030s.</p>
<p>So just the way this is greatly amplified</p>
<p>by being connected to the cloud,</p>
<p>we can connect our own brain to the cloud,</p>
<p>and just do what we can do by using this machine.</p>
<p>Do you think it would look like</p>
<p>the brain computer interface of like Neuralink?</p>
<p>So would it be?</p>
<p>Well, Neuralink, it&rsquo;s an attempt to do that.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have the bandwidth that we need.</p>
<p>Yet, right?</p>
<p>Right, but I think,</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re gonna get permission for this</p>
<p>because there are a lot of people</p>
<p>who absolutely need it because they can&rsquo;t communicate.</p>
<p>I know a couple people like that</p>
<p>who have ideas and they cannot,</p>
<p>they cannot move their muscles and so on.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t communicate.</p>
<p>And so for them, this would be very valuable,</p>
<p>but we could all use it.</p>
<p>Basically, it&rsquo;d be,</p>
<p>turn us into something that would be like we have a phone,</p>
<p>but it would be in our minds.</p>
<p>It would be kind of instantaneous.</p>
<p>And maybe communication between two people</p>
<p>would not require this low bandwidth mechanism of language.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what that would be,</p>
<p>although we do know that computers can share information</p>
<p>like language instantly.</p>
<p>They can share many, many books in a second.</p>
<p>So we could do that as well.</p>
<p>If you look at what our brain does,</p>
<p>it actually can manipulate different parameters.</p>
<p>So we talk about these large language models.</p>
<p>I mean, I had written that</p>
<p>it requires a certain amount of information</p>
<p>in order to be effective</p>
<p>and that we would not see AI really being effective</p>
<p>until it got to that level.</p>
<p>And we had large language models</p>
<p>that were like 10 billion bytes, didn&rsquo;t work very well.</p>
<p>They finally got to a hundred billion bytes</p>
<p>and now they work fairly well.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re going to a trillion bytes.</p>
<p>If you say lambda has a hundred billion bytes,</p>
<p>what does that mean?</p>
<p>Well, what if you had something that had one byte,</p>
<p>one parameter, maybe you wanna tell</p>
<p>whether or not something&rsquo;s an elephant or not.</p>
<p>And so you put in something that would detect its trunk.</p>
<p>If it has a trunk, it&rsquo;s an elephant.</p>
<p>If it doesn&rsquo;t have a trunk, it&rsquo;s not an elephant.</p>
<p>That would work fairly well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few problems with it.</p>
<p>And it really wouldn&rsquo;t be able to tell what a trunk is,</p>
<p>but anyway.</p>
<p>And maybe other things other than elephants have trunks,</p>
<p>you might get really confused.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure which animals have trunks,</p>
<p>but how do you define a trunk?</p>
<p>But yeah, that&rsquo;s one parameter.</p>
<p>You can do okay.</p>
<p>So these things have a hundred billion parameters.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re able to deal with very complex issues.</p>
<p>All kinds of trunks.</p>
<p>Human beings actually have a little bit more than that,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re getting to the point</p>
<p>where they can emulate humans.</p>
<p>If we were able to connect this to our neocortex,</p>
<p>we would basically add more of these abilities</p>
<p>to make distinctions,</p>
<p>and it could ultimately be much smarter</p>
<p>and also be attached to information</p>
<p>that we feel is reliable.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re headed.</p>
<p>So you think that there will be a merger in the 30s,</p>
<p>an increasing amount of merging</p>
<p>between the human brain and the AI brain?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And the AI brain is really an emulation of human beings.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re creating them,</p>
<p>because human beings act the same way,</p>
<p>and this is basically to amplify them.</p>
<p>I mean, this amplifies our brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit clumsy to interact with,</p>
<p>but it definitely is way beyond what we had 15 years ago.</p>
<p>But the implementation becomes different,</p>
<p>just like a bird versus the airplane,</p>
<p>even though the AI brain is an emulation,</p>
<p>it starts adding features we might not otherwise have,</p>
<p>like ability to consume a huge amount</p>
<p>of information quickly,</p>
<p>like look up thousands of Wikipedia articles in one take.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I mean, we can get, for example,</p>
<p>issues like simulated biology,</p>
<p>where it can simulate many different things at once.</p>
<p>We already had one example of simulated biology,</p>
<p>which is the Moderna vaccine.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s gonna be now</p>
<p>the way in which we create medications.</p>
<p>But they were able to simulate</p>
<p>what each example of an mRNA would do to a human being,</p>
<p>and they were able to simulate that quite reliably.</p>
<p>And we actually simulated billions</p>
<p>of different mRNA sequences,</p>
<p>and they found the ones that were the best,</p>
<p>and they created the vaccine.</p>
<p>And they did, and talked about doing that quickly,</p>
<p>they did that in two days.</p>
<p>Now, how long would a human being take</p>
<p>to simulate billions of different mRNA sequences?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that we could do it at all,</p>
<p>but it would take many years.</p>
<p>They did it in two days, and one of the reasons</p>
<p>that people didn&rsquo;t like vaccines</p>
<p>is because it was done too quickly,</p>
<p>it was done too fast.</p>
<p>And they actually included the time it took to test it out,</p>
<p>which was 10 months, so they figured,</p>
<p>okay, it took 10 months to create this.</p>
<p>Actually, it took us two days.</p>
<p>And we also will be able to ultimately do the tests</p>
<p>in a few days as well.</p>
<p>Oh, because we can simulate how the body will respond to it.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a little bit more complicated</p>
<p>because the body has a lot of different elements,</p>
<p>and we have to simulate all of that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s coming as well.</p>
<p>So ultimately, we could create it in a few days</p>
<p>and then test it in a few days, and it would be done.</p>
<p>And we can do that with every type</p>
<p>of medical insufficiency that we have.</p>
<p>So curing all diseases, improving certain functions</p>
<p>of the body, supplements, drugs for recreation,</p>
<p>for health, for performance, for productivity,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re headed,</p>
<p>because I mean, right now we have a very inefficient way</p>
<p>of creating these new medications.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve already shown it, and the Moderna vaccine</p>
<p>is actually the best of the vaccines we&rsquo;ve had,</p>
<p>and it literally took two days to create.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll get to the point</p>
<p>where we can test it out also quickly.</p>
<p>Are you impressed by AlphaFold</p>
<p>and the solution to the protein folding,</p>
<p>which essentially is simulating, modeling</p>
<p>this primitive building block of life,</p>
<p>which is a protein, and its 3D shape?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty remarkable that they can actually predict</p>
<p>what the 3D shape of these things are,</p>
<p>but they did it with the same type of neural net</p>
<p>that won, for example, the Go test.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all the same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all the same.</p>
<p>All the same approaches.</p>
<p>They took that same thing and just changed the rules</p>
<p>to chess, and within a couple of days,</p>
<p>it now played a master level of chess</p>
<p>greater than any human being.</p>
<p>And the same thing then worked for AlphaFold,</p>
<p>which no human had done.</p>
<p>I mean, human beings could do,</p>
<p>the best humans could maybe do 15, 20%</p>
<p>of figuring out what the shape would be.</p>
<p>And after a few takes, it ultimately did just about 100%.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>Do you still think the singularity will happen in 2045?</p>
<p>And what does that look like?</p>
<p>Once we can amplify our brain with computers directly,</p>
<p>which will happen in the 2030s,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna keep growing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another whole theme,</p>
<p>which is the exponential growth of computing power.</p>
<p>Yeah, so looking at price performance of computation</p>
<p>from 1939 to 2021.</p>
<p>Right, so that starts with the very first computer</p>
<p>actually created by a German during World War II.</p>
<p>You might have thought that that might be significant,</p>
<p>but actually the Germans didn&rsquo;t think computers</p>
<p>were significant, and they completely rejected it.</p>
<p>The second one is also the ZUSA 2.</p>
<p>And by the way, we&rsquo;re looking at a plot</p>
<p>with the X axis being the year from 1935 to 2025.</p>
<p>And on the Y axis in log scale</p>
<p>is computation per second per constant dollar.</p>
<p>So dollar normalized inflation.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s growing linearly on the log scale,</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s growing exponentially.</p>
<p>The third one was the British computer,</p>
<p>which the Allies did take very seriously.</p>
<p>And it cracked the German code</p>
<p>and enables the British to win the Battle of Britain,</p>
<p>which otherwise absolutely would not have happened</p>
<p>if they hadn&rsquo;t cracked the code using that computer.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s an exponential graph.</p>
<p>So a straight line on that graph is exponential growth.</p>
<p>And you see 80 years of exponential growth.</p>
<p>And I would say about every five years,</p>
<p>and this happened shortly before the pandemic,</p>
<p>people saying, well, they call it Moore&rsquo;s law,</p>
<p>which is not the correct, because that&rsquo;s not all intel.</p>
<p>In fact, this started decades before intel was even created.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t with transistors formed into a grid.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just transistor count or transistor size.</p>
<p>Right, it started with relays, then went to vacuum tubes,</p>
<p>then went to individual transistors,</p>
<p>and then to integrated circuits.</p>
<p>And integrated circuits actually starts</p>
<p>like in the middle of this graph.</p>
<p>And it has nothing to do with intel.</p>
<p>Intel actually was a key part of this.</p>
<p>But a few years ago, they stopped making the fastest chips.</p>
<p>But if you take the fastest chip of any technology</p>
<p>in that year, you get this kind of graph.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s definitely continuing for 80 years.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t think Moore&rsquo;s law, broadly defined, is dead.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been declared dead multiple times throughout this process.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the term Moore&rsquo;s law,</p>
<p>because it has nothing to do with Moore or with intel.</p>
<p>But yes, the exponential growth of computing is continuing.</p>
<p>It has never stopped.</p>
<p>From various sources.</p>
<p>I mean, it went through World War II,</p>
<p>it went through global recessions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just continuing.</p>
<p>And if you continue that out, along with software gains,</p>
<p>which is a whole nother issue,</p>
<p>and they really multiply,</p>
<p>whatever you get from software gains,</p>
<p>you multiply by the computer gains,</p>
<p>you get faster and faster speed.</p>
<p>This is actually the fastest computer models</p>
<p>that have been created.</p>
<p>And that actually expands roughly twice a year.</p>
<p>Like, every six months it expands by two.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re looking at a plot from 2010 to 2022.</p>
<p>On the x axis is the publication date of the model,</p>
<p>and perhaps sometimes the actual paper associated with it.</p>
<p>And on the y axis is training, compute, and flops.</p>
<p>And so basically this is looking at the increase</p>
<p>in the, not transistors,</p>
<p>but the computational power of neural networks.</p>
<p>Yes, the computational power that created these models.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s doubled every six months.</p>
<p>Which is even faster than transistor division.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Now actually, since it goes faster than the amount of cost,</p>
<p>this has actually become a greater investment</p>
<p>to create these.</p>
<p>But at any rate, by the time we get to 2045,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be able to multiply our intelligence</p>
<p>many millions fold.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just very hard to imagine what that will be like.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the singularity where we can&rsquo;t even imagine.</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s why we call it the singularity.</p>
<p>Because the singularity in physics,</p>
<p>something gets sucked into its singularity</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t tell what&rsquo;s going on in there</p>
<p>because no information can get out of it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s various problems with that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too much beyond what we can imagine.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible we don&rsquo;t notice</p>
<p>that what the singularity actually feels like</p>
<p>is we just live through it</p>
<p>with exponentially increasing cognitive capabilities</p>
<p>and we almost, because everything&rsquo;s moving so quickly,</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t really able to introspect</p>
<p>that our life has changed.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I mean, we will have that much greater capacity</p>
<p>to understand things, so we should be able to look back.</p>
<p>Looking at history, understand history.</p>
<p>But we will need people, basically like you and me,</p>
<p>to actually think about these things.</p>
<p>But we might be distracted</p>
<p>by all the other sources of entertainment and fun</p>
<p>because the exponential power of intellect is growing,</p>
<p>but also there&rsquo;ll be a lot of fun.</p>
<p>The amount of ways you can have, you know.</p>
<p>I mean, we already have a lot of fun with computer games</p>
<p>and so on that are really quite remarkable.</p>
<p>What do you think about the digital world,</p>
<p>the metaverse, virtual reality?</p>
<p>Will that have a component in this</p>
<p>or will most of our advancement be in physical reality?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a little bit like Second Life,</p>
<p>although the Second Life actually didn&rsquo;t work very well</p>
<p>because it couldn&rsquo;t actually handle too many people.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think the metaverse has come to being.</p>
<p>I think there will be something like that.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t necessarily be from that one company.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s gonna be competitors.</p>
<p>But yes, we&rsquo;re gonna live increasingly online,</p>
<p>and particularly if our brains are online.</p>
<p>I mean, how could we not be online?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible that given this merger with AI,</p>
<p>most of our meaningful interactions</p>
<p>will be in this virtual world most of our life?</p>
<p>We fall in love, we make friends,</p>
<p>we come up with ideas, we do collaborations, we have fun.</p>
<p>I actually know somebody who&rsquo;s marrying somebody</p>
<p>that they never met.</p>
<p>I think they just met her briefly before the wedding,</p>
<p>but she actually fell in love with this other person,</p>
<p>never having met them.</p>
<p>And I think the love is real, so.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a beautiful story,</p>
<p>but do you think that story is one that might be experienced</p>
<p>as opposed to by hundreds of thousands of people,</p>
<p>but instead by hundreds of millions of people?</p>
<p>I mean, it really gives you appreciation</p>
<p>for these virtual ways of communicating.</p>
<p>And if anybody can do it,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s really not such a freak story.</p>
<p>So I think more and more people will do that.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s turning our back</p>
<p>on our entire history of evolution.</p>
<p>The old days, we used to fall in love by holding hands</p>
<p>and sitting by the fire, that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Here, you&rsquo;re playing.</p>
<p>Actually, I have five patents on where you can hold hands,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re separated.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>So the touch, the sense, it&rsquo;s all just senses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all just replicated.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, touch is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just that you&rsquo;re touching someone or not.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole way of doing it, and it&rsquo;s very subtle.</p>
<p>But ultimately, we can emulate all of that.</p>
<p>Are you excited by that future?</p>
<p>Do you worry about that future?</p>
<p>I have certain worries about the future,</p>
<p>but not virtual touch.</p>
<p>Well, I agree with you.</p>
<p>You described six stages</p>
<p>in the evolution of information processing in the universe,</p>
<p>as you started to describe.</p>
<p>Can you maybe talk through some of those stages</p>
<p>from the physics and chemistry to DNA and brains,</p>
<p>and then to the very end,</p>
<p>to the very beautiful end of this process?</p>
<p>It actually gets more rapid.</p>
<p>So physics and chemistry, that&rsquo;s how we started.</p>
<p>So the very beginning of the universe.</p>
<p>We had lots of electrons and various things traveling around.</p>
<p>And that took actually many billions of years,</p>
<p>kind of jumping ahead here to kind of</p>
<p>some of the last stages where we have things</p>
<p>like love and creativity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really quite remarkable that that happens.</p>
<p>But finally, physics and chemistry created biology and DNA.</p>
<p>And now you had actually one type of molecule</p>
<p>that described the cutting edge of this process.</p>
<p>And we go from physics and chemistry to biology.</p>
<p>And finally, biology created brains.</p>
<p>I mean, not everything that&rsquo;s created by biology</p>
<p>has a brain, but eventually brains came along.</p>
<p>And all of this is happening faster and faster.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It created increasingly complex organisms.</p>
<p>Another key thing is actually not just brains,</p>
<p>but our thumb.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s a lot of animals</p>
<p>with brains even bigger than humans.</p>
<p>I mean, elephants have a bigger brain.</p>
<p>Whales have a bigger brain.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;ve not created technology</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t have a thumb.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one of the really key elements</p>
<p>in the evolution of humans.</p>
<p>This physical manipulator device</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s useful for puzzle solving in the physical reality.</p>
<p>So I could think, I could look at a tree and go,</p>
<p>oh, I could actually trip that branch down</p>
<p>and eliminate the leaves and carve a tip on it</p>
<p>and I would create technology.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t do that if you don&rsquo;t have a thumb.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So thumbs then created technology</p>
<p>and technology also had a memory.</p>
<p>And now those memories are competing</p>
<p>with the scale and scope of human beings.</p>
<p>And ultimately we&rsquo;ll go beyond it.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re gonna merge human technology</p>
<p>with human intelligence</p>
<p>and understand how human intelligence works,</p>
<p>which I think we already do.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re putting that into our human technology.</p>
<p>So create the technology inspired by our own intelligence</p>
<p>and then that technology supersedes us</p>
<p>in terms of its capabilities.</p>
<p>And we ride along.</p>
<p>Or do you ultimately see it as&hellip;</p>
<p>And we ride along, but a lot of people don&rsquo;t see that.</p>
<p>They say, well, you&rsquo;ve got humans and you&rsquo;ve got machines</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no way we can ultimately compete with humans.</p>
<p>And you can already see that.</p>
<p>Lee Soudal, who&rsquo;s like the best Go player in the world,</p>
<p>says he&rsquo;s not gonna play Go anymore.</p>
<p>Because playing Go for a human,</p>
<p>that was like the ultimate in intelligence</p>
<p>because no one else could do that.</p>
<p>But now a machine can actually go way beyond him.</p>
<p>And so he says, well, there&rsquo;s no point playing it anymore.</p>
<p>That may be more true for games than it is for life.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of benefit</p>
<p>to working together with AI in regular life.</p>
<p>So if you were to put a probability on it,</p>
<p>is it more likely that we merge with AI</p>
<p>or AI replaces us?</p>
<p>A lot of people just think computers come along</p>
<p>and they compete with them.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t really compete and that&rsquo;s the end of it.</p>
<p>As opposed to them increasing our abilities.</p>
<p>And if you look at most technology,</p>
<p>it increases our abilities.</p>
<p>I mean, look at the history of work.</p>
<p>Look at what people did 100 years ago.</p>
<p>Does any of that exist anymore?</p>
<p>People, I mean, if you were to predict</p>
<p>that all of these jobs would go away</p>
<p>and would be done by machines,</p>
<p>people would say, well, there&rsquo;s gonna be,</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s gonna have jobs</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna be massive unemployment.</p>
<p>But I show in this book that&rsquo;s coming out</p>
<p>the amount of people that are working,</p>
<p>even as a percentage of the population has gone way up.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking at the x axis year from 1774 to 2024</p>
<p>and on the y axis, personal income per capita</p>
<p>in constant dollars and it&rsquo;s growing super linearly.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s 2021 constant dollars and it&rsquo;s gone way up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what you would predict</p>
<p>given that we would predict</p>
<p>that all these jobs would go away.</p>
<p>But the reason it&rsquo;s gone up is because</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve basically enhanced our own capabilities</p>
<p>by using these machines</p>
<p>as opposed to them just competing with us.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a key way in which we&rsquo;re gonna be able</p>
<p>to become far smarter than we are now</p>
<p>by increasing the number of different parameters</p>
<p>we can consider in making a decision.</p>
<p>I was very fortunate, I am very fortunate</p>
<p>to be able to get a glimpse preview</p>
<p>of your upcoming book, Singularity is Nearer.</p>
<p>And one of the themes outside of just discussing</p>
<p>the increasing exponential growth of technology,</p>
<p>one of the themes is that things are getting better</p>
<p>in all aspects of life.</p>
<p>And you talked just about this.</p>
<p>So one of the things you&rsquo;re saying is with jobs.</p>
<p>So let me just ask about that.</p>
<p>There is a big concern that automation,</p>
<p>especially powerful AI, will get rid of jobs.</p>
<p>There are people who lose jobs.</p>
<p>And as you were saying, the sense is</p>
<p>throughout the history of the 20th century,</p>
<p>automation did not do that ultimately.</p>
<p>And so the question is, will this time be different?</p>
<p>Right, that is the question.</p>
<p>Will this time be different?</p>
<p>And it really has to do with how quickly</p>
<p>we can merge with this type of intelligence.</p>
<p>Whether Lambda or GPT3 is out there,</p>
<p>and maybe it&rsquo;s overcome some of its key problems,</p>
<p>and we really haven&rsquo;t enhanced human intelligence,</p>
<p>that might be a negative scenario.</p>
<p>But I mean, that&rsquo;s why we create technologies,</p>
<p>to enhance ourselves.</p>
<p>And I believe we will be enhanced</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m just going to sit here with</p>
<p>300 million modules in our neocortex.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to be able to go beyond that.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s useful, but we can multiply that by 10,</p>
<p>100, 1,000, a million.</p>
<p>And you might think, well, what&rsquo;s the point of doing that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like asking somebody that&rsquo;s never heard music,</p>
<p>well, what&rsquo;s the value of music?</p>
<p>I mean, you can&rsquo;t appreciate it until you&rsquo;ve created it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some worry that there&rsquo;ll be a wealth disparity.</p>
<p>Class or wealth disparity, only the rich people</p>
<p>will be, basically, the rich people</p>
<p>will first have access to this kind of thing,</p>
<p>and then because of this kind of thing,</p>
<p>because the ability to merge</p>
<p>will get richer exponentially faster.</p>
<p>And I say that&rsquo;s just like cell phones.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s like four billion cell phones</p>
<p>in the world today.</p>
<p>In fact, when cell phones first came out,</p>
<p>you had to be fairly wealthy.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t very inexpensive.</p>
<p>So you had to have some wealth in order to afford them.</p>
<p>Yeah, there were these big, sexy phones.</p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t work very well.</p>
<p>They did almost nothing.</p>
<p>So you can only afford these things if you&rsquo;re wealthy</p>
<p>at a point where they really don&rsquo;t work very well.</p>
<p>So achieving scale and making it inexpensive</p>
<p>is part of making the thing work well.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So these are not totally cheap, but they&rsquo;re pretty cheap.</p>
<p>I mean, you can get them for a few hundred dollars.</p>
<p>Especially given the kind of things it provides for you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people in the third world</p>
<p>that have very little, but they have a smartphone.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>And the same will be true with AI.</p>
<p>I mean, I see homeless people have their own cell phones.</p>
<p>Yeah, so your sense is any kind of advanced technology</p>
<p>will take the same trajectory.</p>
<p>Right, it ultimately becomes cheap and will be affordable.</p>
<p>I probably would not be the first person</p>
<p>to put something in my brain to connect to computers</p>
<p>because I think it will have limitations.</p>
<p>But once it&rsquo;s really perfected,</p>
<p>and at that point it&rsquo;ll be pretty inexpensive,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;ll be pretty affordable.</p>
<p>So in which other ways, as you outline your book,</p>
<p>is life getting better?</p>
<p>Because I think&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I have 50 charts in there</p>
<p>where everything is getting better.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a kind of cynicism about,</p>
<p>like even if you look at extreme poverty, for example.</p>
<p>For example, this is actually a poll</p>
<p>taken on extreme poverty, and people were asked,</p>
<p>has poverty gotten better or worse?</p>
<p>And the options are increased by 50%,</p>
<p>increased by 25%, remain the same,</p>
<p>decreased by 25%, decreased by 50%.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re watching this or listening to this,</p>
<p>try to vote for yourself.</p>
<p>70% thought it had gotten worse,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the general impression.</p>
<p>88% thought it had gotten worse or remained the same.</p>
<p>Only 1% thought it decreased by 50%,</p>
<p>and that is the answer.</p>
<p>It actually decreased by 50%.</p>
<p>So only 1% of people got the right optimistic estimate</p>
<p>of how poverty is.</p>
<p>Right, and this is the reality,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s true of almost everything you look at.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna go back 100 years or 50 years.</p>
<p>Things were quite miserable then,</p>
<p>but we tend not to remember that.</p>
<p>So literacy rate increasing over the past few centuries</p>
<p>across all the different nations,</p>
<p>nearly to 100% across many of the nations in the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gone way up.</p>
<p>Average years of education have gone way up.</p>
<p>Life expectancy is also increasing.</p>
<p>Life expectancy was 48 in 1900.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s over 80 now.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s gonna continue to go up,</p>
<p>particularly as we get into more advanced stages</p>
<p>of simulated biology.</p>
<p>For life expectancy, these trends are the same</p>
<p>for at birth, age one, age five, age 10,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not just the infant mortality.</p>
<p>And I have 50 more graphs in the book</p>
<p>about all kinds of things.</p>
<p>Even spread of democracy,</p>
<p>which might bring up some sort of controversial issues,</p>
<p>it still has gone way up.</p>
<p>Well, that one has gone way up,</p>
<p>but that one is a bumpy road, right?</p>
<p>Exactly, and somebody might represent democracy</p>
<p>and go backwards, but we basically had no democracies</p>
<p>before the creation of the United States,</p>
<p>which was a little over two centuries ago,</p>
<p>which in the scale of human history isn&rsquo;t that long.</p>
<p>Do you think superintelligence systems will help</p>
<p>with democracy?</p>
<p>So what is democracy?</p>
<p>Democracy is giving a voice to the populace</p>
<p>and having their ideas, having their beliefs,</p>
<p>having their views represented.</p>
<p>Well, I hope so.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve seen social networks</p>
<p>can spread conspiracy theories,</p>
<p>which have been quite negative,</p>
<p>being, for example, being against any kind of stuff</p>
<p>that would help your health.</p>
<p>So those kinds of ideas have,</p>
<p>on social media, what you notice is they increase</p>
<p>engagement, so dramatic division increases engagement.</p>
<p>Do you worry about AI systems that will learn</p>
<p>to maximize that division?</p>
<p>I mean, I do have some concerns about this,</p>
<p>and I have a chapter in the book about the perils</p>
<p>of advanced AI, spreading misinformation</p>
<p>on social networks is one of them,</p>
<p>but there are many others.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the one that worries you the most</p>
<p>that we should think about to try to avoid?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s hard to choose.</p>
<p>We do have the nuclear power that evolved</p>
<p>when I was a child, I remember,</p>
<p>and we would actually do these drills against a nuclear war.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d get under our desks and put our hands behind our heads</p>
<p>to protect us from a nuclear war.</p>
<p>Seems to work, we&rsquo;re still around, so.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re protected.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s still a concern.</p>
<p>And there are key dangerous situations</p>
<p>that can take place in biology.</p>
<p>Someone could create a virus that&rsquo;s very,</p>
<p>I mean, we have viruses that are hard to spread,</p>
<p>and they can be very dangerous,</p>
<p>and we have viruses that are easy to spread,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not so dangerous.</p>
<p>Somebody could create something</p>
<p>that would be very easy to spread and very dangerous,</p>
<p>and be very hard to stop.</p>
<p>It could be something that would spread</p>
<p>without people noticing, because people could get it,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d have no symptoms, and then everybody would get it,</p>
<p>and then symptoms would occur maybe a month later.</p>
<p>So I mean, and that actually doesn&rsquo;t occur normally,</p>
<p>because if we were to have a problem with that,</p>
<p>we wouldn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>So the fact that humans exist means that we don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>viruses that can spread easily and kill us,</p>
<p>because otherwise we wouldn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Yeah, viruses don&rsquo;t wanna do that.</p>
<p>They want to spread and keep the host alive somewhat.</p>
<p>So you can describe various dangers with biology.</p>
<p>Also nanotechnology, which we actually haven&rsquo;t experienced</p>
<p>yet, but there are people that are creating nanotechnology,</p>
<p>and I describe that in the book.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re excited by the possibilities of nanotechnology,</p>
<p>of nanobots, of being able to do things inside our body,</p>
<p>inside our mind, that&rsquo;s going to help.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s exciting, what&rsquo;s terrifying about nanobots?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s exciting is that that&rsquo;s a way to communicate</p>
<p>with our neocortex, because each neocortex is pretty small</p>
<p>and you need a small entity that can actually get in there</p>
<p>and establish a communication channel.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s gonna really be necessary to connect our brains</p>
<p>to AI within ourselves, because otherwise it would be hard</p>
<p>for us to compete with it.</p>
<p>In a high bandwidth way.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s key, actually, because a lot of the things</p>
<p>like Neuralink are really not high bandwidth yet.</p>
<p>So nanobots is the way you achieve high bandwidth.</p>
<p>How much intelligence would those nanobots have?</p>
<p>Yeah, they don&rsquo;t need a lot, just enough to basically</p>
<p>establish a communication channel to one nanobot.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s primarily about communication.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Between external computing devices</p>
<p>and our biological thinking machine.</p>
<p>What worries you about nanobots?</p>
<p>Is it similar to with the viruses?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, it&rsquo;s the great goo challenge.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>If you had a nanobot that wanted to create</p>
<p>any kind of entity and repeat itself,</p>
<p>and was able to operate in a natural environment,</p>
<p>it could turn everything into that entity</p>
<p>and basically destroy all biological life.</p>
<p>So you mentioned nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear your opinion about the 21st century</p>
<p>and whether you think we might destroy ourselves.</p>
<p>And maybe your opinion, if it has changed</p>
<p>by looking at what&rsquo;s going on in Ukraine,</p>
<p>that we could have a hot war with nuclear powers involved</p>
<p>and the tensions building and the seeming forgetting</p>
<p>of how terrifying and destructive nuclear weapons are.</p>
<p>Do you think humans might destroy ourselves</p>
<p>in the 21st century, and if we do, how?</p>
<p>And how do we avoid it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s gonna happen</p>
<p>despite the terrors of that war.</p>
<p>It is a possibility, but I mean, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unlikely in your mind.</p>
<p>Yeah, even with the tensions we&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>with this one nuclear power plant that&rsquo;s been taken over,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very tense, but I don&rsquo;t actually see a lot of people</p>
<p>worrying that that&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll avoid that.</p>
<p>We had two nuclear bombs go off in 45,</p>
<p>so now we&rsquo;re 77 years later.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re doing pretty good.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve never had another one go off through anger.</p>
<p>People forget the lessons of history.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I mean, I am worried about it.</p>
<p>I mean, that is definitely a challenge.</p>
<p>But you believe that we&rsquo;ll make it out</p>
<p>and ultimately superintelligent AI will help us make it out</p>
<p>as opposed to destroy us.</p>
<p>I think so, but we do have to be mindful of these dangers.</p>
<p>And there are other dangers besides nuclear weapons, so.</p>
<p>So to get back to merging with AI,</p>
<p>will we be able to upload our mind in a computer</p>
<p>in a way where we might even transcend</p>
<p>the constraints of our bodies?</p>
<p>So copy our mind into a computer and leave the body behind?</p>
<p>Let me describe one thing I&rsquo;ve already done with my father.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great story.</p>
<p>So we created a technology, this is public,</p>
<p>came out, I think, six years ago,</p>
<p>where you could ask any question</p>
<p>and the release product,</p>
<p>which I think is still on the market,</p>
<p>it would read 200,000 books.</p>
<p>And then find the one sentence in 200,000 books</p>
<p>that best answered your question.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually quite interesting.</p>
<p>You can ask all kinds of questions</p>
<p>and you get the best answer in 200,000 books.</p>
<p>But I was also able to take it</p>
<p>and not go through 200,000 books,</p>
<p>but go through a book that I put together,</p>
<p>which is basically everything my father had written.</p>
<p>So everything he had written, I had gathered,</p>
<p>and we created a book,</p>
<p>everything that Frederick Herzog had written.</p>
<p>Now, I didn&rsquo;t think this actually would work that well</p>
<p>because stuff he had written was stuff about how to lay out.</p>
<p>I mean, he directed choral groups</p>
<p>and music groups,</p>
<p>and he would be laying out how the people should,</p>
<p>where they should sit and how to fund this</p>
<p>and all kinds of things</p>
<p>that really didn&rsquo;t seem that interesting.</p>
<p>And yet, when you ask a question,</p>
<p>it would go through it</p>
<p>and it would actually give you a very good answer.</p>
<p>So I said, well, who&rsquo;s the most interesting composer?</p>
<p>And he said, well, definitely Brahms.</p>
<p>And he would go on about how Brahms was fabulous</p>
<p>and talk about the importance of music education.</p>
<p>So you could have essentially a question and answer,</p>
<p>a conversation with him.</p>
<p>You could have a conversation with him,</p>
<p>which was actually more interesting than talking to him</p>
<p>because if you talked to him,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d be concerned about how they&rsquo;re gonna lay out</p>
<p>this property to give a choral group.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d be concerned about the day to day</p>
<p>versus the big questions.</p>
<p>Exactly, yeah.</p>
<p>And you did ask about the meaning of life</p>
<p>and he answered, love.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you miss him?</p>
<p>Yes, I do.</p>
<p>Yeah, you get used to missing somebody after 52 years,</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t really have intelligent conversations with him</p>
<p>until later in life.</p>
<p>In the last few years, he was sick,</p>
<p>which meant he was home a lot</p>
<p>and I was actually able to talk to him</p>
<p>about different things like music and other things.</p>
<p>And so I miss that very much.</p>
<p>What did you learn about life from your father?</p>
<p>What part of him is with you now?</p>
<p>He was devoted to music.</p>
<p>And when he would create something to music,</p>
<p>it put him in a different world.</p>
<p>Otherwise, he was very shy.</p>
<p>And if people got together,</p>
<p>he tended not to interact with people</p>
<p>just because of his shyness.</p>
<p>But when he created music, he was like a different person.</p>
<p>Do you have that in you?</p>
<p>That kind of light that shines?</p>
<p>I mean, I got involved with technology at like age five.</p>
<p>And you fell in love with it</p>
<p>in the same way he did with music?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I remember this actually happened with my grandmother.</p>
<p>She had a manual typewriter</p>
<p>and she wrote a book, One Life Is Not Enough,</p>
<p>which actually a good title for a book I might write,</p>
<p>but it was about a school she had created.</p>
<p>Well, actually her mother created it.</p>
<p>So my mother&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s mother created the school in 1868.</p>
<p>And it was the first school in Europe</p>
<p>that provided higher education for girls.</p>
<p>It went through 14th grade.</p>
<p>If you were a girl and you were lucky enough</p>
<p>to get an education at all,</p>
<p>it would go through like ninth grade.</p>
<p>And many people didn&rsquo;t have any education as a girl.</p>
<p>This went through 14th grade.</p>
<p>Her mother created it, she took it over,</p>
<p>and the book was about the history of the school</p>
<p>and her involvement with it.</p>
<p>When she presented it to me,</p>
<p>I was not so interested in the story of the school,</p>
<p>but I was totally amazed with this manual typewriter.</p>
<p>I mean, here is something you could put a blank piece</p>
<p>of paper into and you could turn it into something</p>
<p>that looked like it came from a book.</p>
<p>And you can actually type on it</p>
<p>and it looked like it came from a book.</p>
<p>It was just amazing to me.</p>
<p>And I could see actually how it worked.</p>
<p>And I was also interested in magic.</p>
<p>But in magic, if somebody actually knows how it works,</p>
<p>the magic goes away.</p>
<p>The magic doesn&rsquo;t stay there</p>
<p>if you actually understand how it works.</p>
<p>But here was technology.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have that word when I was five or six.</p>
<p>And the magic was still there for you?</p>
<p>The magic was still there, even if you knew how it worked.</p>
<p>So I became totally interested in this</p>
<p>and then went around, collected little pieces</p>
<p>of mechanical objects from bicycles, from broken radios.</p>
<p>I would go through the neighborhood.</p>
<p>This was an era where you would allow five or six year olds</p>
<p>to run through the neighborhood and do this.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t do that anymore.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t know how to put them together.</p>
<p>I said, if I could just figure out</p>
<p>how to put these things together, I could solve any problem.</p>
<p>And I actually remember talking to these very old girls.</p>
<p>I think they were 10.</p>
<p>And telling them, if I could just figure this out,</p>
<p>we could fly, we could do anything.</p>
<p>And they said, well, you have quite an imagination.</p>
<p>And then when I was in third grade,</p>
<p>so I was like eight,</p>
<p>created like a virtual reality theater</p>
<p>where people could come on stage</p>
<p>and they could move their arms.</p>
<p>And all of it was controlled through one control box.</p>
<p>It was all done with mechanical technology.</p>
<p>And it was a big hit in my third grade class.</p>
<p>And then I went on to do things</p>
<p>in junior high school science fairs</p>
<p>and high school science fairs.</p>
<p>I won the Westinghouse Science Talent Search.</p>
<p>So I mean, I became committed to technology</p>
<p>when I was five or six years old.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked about how you use lucid dreaming to think,</p>
<p>to come up with ideas as a source of creativity.</p>
<p>Because you maybe talk through that,</p>
<p>maybe the process of how to,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve invented a lot of things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve came up and thought through</p>
<p>some very interesting ideas.</p>
<p>What advice would you give,</p>
<p>or can you speak to the process of thinking,</p>
<p>of how to think, how to think creatively?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, sometimes I will think through in a dream</p>
<p>and try to interpret that.</p>
<p>But I think the key issue that I would tell younger people</p>
<p>is to put yourself in the position</p>
<p>that what you&rsquo;re trying to create already exists.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re explaining, like&hellip;</p>
<p>How it works.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>You paint a world that you would like to exist,</p>
<p>you think it exists, and reverse engineer that.</p>
<p>And then you actually imagine you&rsquo;re giving a speech</p>
<p>about how you created this.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;d have to then work backwards</p>
<p>as to how you would create it in order to make it work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>And that requires some imagination too,</p>
<p>some first principles thinking.</p>
<p>You have to visualize that world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>And generally, when I talk about things</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to invent, I would use the present tense</p>
<p>as if it already exists.</p>
<p>Not just to give myself that confidence,</p>
<p>but everybody else who&rsquo;s working on it.</p>
<p>We just have to kind of do all the steps</p>
<p>in order to make it actual.</p>
<p>How much of a good idea is about timing?</p>
<p>How much is it about your genius</p>
<p>versus that its time has come?</p>
<p>Timing&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s really why I got into futurism.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t, I wasn&rsquo;t inherently a futurist.</p>
<p>That was not really my goal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really to figure out when things are feasible.</p>
<p>We see that now with large scale models.</p>
<p>The very large scale models like GPT3,</p>
<p>it started two years ago.</p>
<p>Four years ago, it wasn&rsquo;t feasible.</p>
<p>In fact, they did create GPT2, which didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>So it required a certain amount of timing</p>
<p>having to do with this exponential growth</p>
<p>of computing power.</p>
<p>So futurism in some sense is a study of timing,</p>
<p>trying to understand how the world will evolve</p>
<p>and when will the capacity for certain ideas emerge.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s become a thing in itself</p>
<p>and to try to time things in the future.</p>
<p>But really its original purpose was to time my products.</p>
<p>I mean, I did OCR in the 1970s</p>
<p>because OCR doesn&rsquo;t require a lot of computation.</p>
<p>Optical character recognition.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we were able to do that in the 70s</p>
<p>and I waited till the 80s to address speech recognition</p>
<p>since that requires more computation.</p>
<p>So you were thinking through timing</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re developing those things.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Time come.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;ve developed that brain power</p>
<p>to start to think in a futurist sense</p>
<p>when how will the world look like in 2045</p>
<p>and work backwards and how it gets there.</p>
<p>But that has to become a thing in itself</p>
<p>because looking at what things will be like in the future</p>
<p>and the future reflects such dramatic changes in how humans will live</p>
<p>that was worth communicating also.</p>
<p>So you developed that muscle of predicting the future</p>
<p>and then applied broadly</p>
<p>and started to discuss how it changes the world of technology,</p>
<p>how it changes the world of human life on earth.</p>
<p>In Danielle, one of your books,</p>
<p>you write about someone who has the courage</p>
<p>to question assumptions that limit human imagination</p>
<p>to solve problems.</p>
<p>And you also give advice</p>
<p>on how each of us can have this kind of courage.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s good that you picked that quote</p>
<p>because I think that does symbolize what Danielle is about.</p>
<p>Courage.</p>
<p>So how can each of us have that courage</p>
<p>to question assumptions?</p>
<p>I mean, we see that when people can go beyond</p>
<p>the current realm and create something that&rsquo;s new.</p>
<p>I mean, take Uber, for example.</p>
<p>Before that existed, you never thought</p>
<p>that that would be feasible</p>
<p>and it did require changes in the way people work.</p>
<p>Is there practical advice as you give in the book</p>
<p>about what each of us can do to be a Danielle?</p>
<p>Well, she looks at the situation</p>
<p>and tries to imagine how she can overcome various obstacles</p>
<p>and then she goes for it.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s a very good communicator</p>
<p>so she can communicate these ideas to other people.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s practical advice of learning to program</p>
<p>and recording your life and things of this nature.</p>
<p>Become a physicist.</p>
<p>So you list a bunch of different suggestions</p>
<p>of how to throw yourself into this world.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of an idea</p>
<p>how young people can actually change the world</p>
<p>by learning all of these different skills.</p>
<p>And at the core of that is the belief</p>
<p>that you can change the world.</p>
<p>That your mind, your body can change the world.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And not letting anyone else tell you otherwise.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really good, exactly.</p>
<p>When we upload the story you told about your dad</p>
<p>and having a conversation with him,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about uploading your mind to the computer.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll have a future</p>
<p>with something you call afterlife?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have avatars that mimic increasingly better and better</p>
<p>our behavior, our appearance, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Even those that are perhaps no longer with us.</p>
<p>Yes, I mean, we need some information about them.</p>
<p>I mean, think about my father.</p>
<p>I have what he wrote.</p>
<p>Now, he didn&rsquo;t have a word processor,</p>
<p>so he didn&rsquo;t actually write that much.</p>
<p>And our memories of him aren&rsquo;t perfect.</p>
<p>So how do you even know if you&rsquo;ve created something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s satisfactory?</p>
<p>Now, you could do a Frederick Kurzweil Turing test.</p>
<p>It seems like Frederick Kurzweil to me.</p>
<p>But the people who remember him, like me,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a perfect memory.</p>
<p>Is there such a thing as a perfect memory?</p>
<p>Maybe the whole point is for him to make you feel</p>
<p>a certain way.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I think that would be the goal.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the connection we have with loved ones.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really based on very strict definition of truth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more about the experiences we share.</p>
<p>And they get morphed through memory.</p>
<p>But ultimately, they make us smile.</p>
<p>I think we definitely can do that.</p>
<p>And that would be very worthwhile.</p>
<p>So do you think we&rsquo;ll have a world of replicants?</p>
<p>Of copies?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be a bunch of Ray Kurzweils.</p>
<p>Like, I could hang out with one.</p>
<p>I can download it for five bucks</p>
<p>and have a best friend, Ray.</p>
<p>And you, the original copy, wouldn&rsquo;t even know about it.</p>
<p>Is that, do you think that world is,</p>
<p>first of all, do you think that world is feasible?</p>
<p>And do you think there&rsquo;s ethical challenges there?</p>
<p>Like, how would you feel about me hanging out</p>
<p>with Ray Kurzweil and you not knowing about it?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t strike me as a problem.</p>
<p>Which you, the original?</p>
<p>Would you strike, would that cause a problem for you?</p>
<p>No, I would really very much enjoy it.</p>
<p>No, not just hang out with me,</p>
<p>but if somebody hang out with you, a replicant of you.</p>
<p>Well, I think I would start, it sounds exciting,</p>
<p>but then what if they start doing better than me</p>
<p>and take over my friend group?</p>
<p>And then, because they may be an imperfect copy</p>
<p>or there may be more social, all these kinds of things,</p>
<p>and then I become like the old version</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not nearly as exciting.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re a copy of the best version of me</p>
<p>on a good day.</p>
<p>Yeah, but if you hang out with a replicant of me</p>
<p>and that turned out to be successful,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d feel proud of that person because it was based on me.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, but it is a kind of death of this version of you.</p>
<p>Well, not necessarily.</p>
<p>I mean, you can still be alive, right?</p>
<p>But, and you would be proud, okay,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like having kids and you&rsquo;re proud</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve done even more than you were able to do.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>It does bring up new issues,</p>
<p>but it seems like an opportunity.</p>
<p>Well, that replicant should probably have the same rights</p>
<p>as you do.</p>
<p>Well, that gets into a whole issue</p>
<p>because when a replicant occurs,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not necessarily gonna have your rights.</p>
<p>And if a replicant occurs,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s somebody who&rsquo;s already dead,</p>
<p>do they have all the obligations</p>
<p>and that the original person had?</p>
<p>Do they have all the agreements that they had?</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re gonna have to have laws that say yes.</p>
<p>There has to be, if you wanna create a replicant,</p>
<p>they have to have all the same rights as human rights.</p>
<p>Well, you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Someone can create a replicant and say,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s a replicant,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t bother getting their rights.</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that would be illegal, I mean.</p>
<p>Like if you do that, you have to do that in the black market.</p>
<p>If you wanna get an official replicant.</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s not so easy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s supposed to create multiple replicants.</p>
<p>The original rights,</p>
<p>maybe for one person and not for a whole group of people.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So there has to be at least one.</p>
<p>And then all the other ones kinda share the rights.</p>
<p>Yeah, I just don&rsquo;t think that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very difficult to conceive for us humans,</p>
<p>the idea that this country.</p>
<p>You create a replicant that has certain,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve talked to people about this,</p>
<p>including my wife, who would like to get back her father.</p>
<p>And she doesn&rsquo;t worry about who has rights to what.</p>
<p>She would have somebody that she could visit with</p>
<p>and might give her some satisfaction.</p>
<p>And she wouldn&rsquo;t care about any of these other rights.</p>
<p>What does your wife think about multiple rake or as wells?</p>
<p>Have you had that discussion?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t addressed that with her.</p>
<p>I think ultimately that&rsquo;s an important question,</p>
<p>loved ones, how they feel about.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about love.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the key thing, right?</p>
<p>If the loved one&rsquo;s rejected,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna work very well, so.</p>
<p>So the loved ones really are the key determinant,</p>
<p>whether or not this works or not.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also ethical rules.</p>
<p>We have to contend with the idea,</p>
<p>and we have to contend with that idea with AI.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s gonna motivate it is,</p>
<p>I mean, I talk to people who really miss people who are gone</p>
<p>and they would love to get something back,</p>
<p>even if it isn&rsquo;t perfect.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s gonna motivate this.</p>
<p>And that person lives on in some form.</p>
<p>And the more data we have,</p>
<p>the more we&rsquo;re able to reconstruct that person</p>
<p>and allow them to live on.</p>
<p>And eventually as we go forward,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have more and more of this data</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re gonna have none of us</p>
<p>that are inside our neocortex</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna collect a lot of data.</p>
<p>In fact, anything that&rsquo;s data is always collected.</p>
<p>There is something a little bit sad,</p>
<p>which is becoming, or maybe it&rsquo;s hopeful,</p>
<p>which is more and more common these days,</p>
<p>which when a person passes away,</p>
<p>you have their Twitter account,</p>
<p>and you have the last tweet they tweeted,</p>
<p>like something they needed.</p>
<p>And you can recreate them now</p>
<p>with large language models and so on.</p>
<p>I mean, you can create somebody that&rsquo;s just like them</p>
<p>and can actually continue to communicate.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s really exciting</p>
<p>because I think in some sense,</p>
<p>like if I were to die today,</p>
<p>in some sense I would continue on if I continued tweeting.</p>
<p>I tweet, therefore I am.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I mean, that&rsquo;s one of the advantages</p>
<p>of a replicant, they can recreate the communications</p>
<p>of that person.</p>
<p>Do you hope, do you think, do you hope</p>
<p>humans will become a multi planetary species?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked about the phases, the six epochs,</p>
<p>and one of them is reaching out into the stars in part.</p>
<p>Yes, but the kind of attempts we&rsquo;re making now</p>
<p>to go to other planetary objects</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t excite me that much</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not really advancing anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not efficient enough?</p>
<p>Yeah, and we&rsquo;re also putting out other human beings,</p>
<p>which is a very inefficient way</p>
<p>to explore these other objects.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m really talking about in the sixth epoch,</p>
<p>the universe wakes up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s where we can spread our super intelligence</p>
<p>throughout the universe.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t mean sending a very soft,</p>
<p>squishy creatures like humans.</p>
<p>Yeah, the universe wakes up.</p>
<p>I mean, we would send intelligence masses of nanobots</p>
<p>which can then go out and colonize</p>
<p>these other parts of the universe.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s intelligent alien civilizations</p>
<p>out there that our bots might meet?</p>
<p>My hunch is no.</p>
<p>Most people say yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>I mean, and the universe is too big.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll cite the Drake equation.</p>
<p>And I think in Singularity is Near,</p>
<p>I have two analyses of the Drake equation,</p>
<p>both with very reasonable assumptions.</p>
<p>And one gives you thousands of advanced civilizations</p>
<p>in each galaxy.</p>
<p>And another one gives you one civilization.</p>
<p>And we know of one.</p>
<p>A lot of the analyses are forgetting</p>
<p>the exponential growth of computation.</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;ve gone from where the fastest way</p>
<p>I could send a message to somebody was with a pony,</p>
<p>which was what, like a century and a half ago?</p>
<p>To the advanced civilization we have today.</p>
<p>And if you accept what I&rsquo;ve said,</p>
<p>go forward a few decades,</p>
<p>you can have absolutely fantastic amount of civilization</p>
<p>compared to a pony, and that&rsquo;s in a couple hundred years.</p>
<p>Yeah, the speed and the scale of information transfer</p>
<p>is growing exponentially in a blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Now think about these other civilizations.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna be spread out at cosmic times.</p>
<p>So if something is like ahead of us or behind us,</p>
<p>it could be ahead of us or behind us by maybe millions</p>
<p>of years, which isn&rsquo;t that much.</p>
<p>I mean, the world is billions of years old,</p>
<p>14 billion or something.</p>
<p>So even a thousand years, if two or 300 years is enough</p>
<p>to go from a pony to fantastic amount of civilization,</p>
<p>we would see that.</p>
<p>So of other civilizations that have occurred,</p>
<p>okay, some might be behind us, but some might be ahead of us.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re ahead of us, they&rsquo;re ahead of us</p>
<p>by thousands, millions of years,</p>
<p>and they would be so far beyond us,</p>
<p>they would be doing galaxy wide engineering.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t see anything doing galaxy wide engineering.</p>
<p>So either they don&rsquo;t exist, or this very universe</p>
<p>is a construction of an alien species.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re living inside a video game.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s another explanation that yes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got some teenage kids in another civilization.</p>
<p>Do you find compelling the simulation hypothesis</p>
<p>as a thought experiment that we&rsquo;re living in a simulation?</p>
<p>The universe is computational.</p>
<p>So we are an example in a computational world.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is a simulation.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean an experiment</p>
<p>by some high school kid in another world,</p>
<p>but it nonetheless is taking place</p>
<p>in a computational world.</p>
<p>And everything that&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>is basically a form of computation.</p>
<p>So you really have to define what you mean</p>
<p>by this whole world being a simulation.</p>
<p>Well, then it&rsquo;s the teenager that makes the video game.</p>
<p>Us humans with our current limited cognitive capability</p>
<p>have strived to understand ourselves</p>
<p>and we have created religions.</p>
<p>We think of God.</p>
<p>Whatever that is, do you think God exists?</p>
<p>And if so, who is God?</p>
<p>I alluded to this before.</p>
<p>We started out with lots of particles going around</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s nothing that represents love and creativity.</p>
<p>And somehow we&rsquo;ve gotten into a world</p>
<p>where love actually exists</p>
<p>and that has to do actually with consciousness</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t have love without consciousness.</p>
<p>So to me, that&rsquo;s God, the fact that we have something</p>
<p>where love, where you can be devoted to someone else</p>
<p>and really feel the love, that&rsquo;s God.</p>
<p>And if you look at the Old Testament,</p>
<p>it was actually created by several different</p>
<p>ravenants in there.</p>
<p>And I think they&rsquo;ve identified three of them.</p>
<p>One of them dealt with God as a person</p>
<p>that you can make deals with and he gets angry</p>
<p>and he wrecks vengeance on various people.</p>
<p>But two of them actually talk about God</p>
<p>as a symbol of love and peace and harmony and so forth.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how they describe God.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my view of God, not as a person in the sky</p>
<p>that you can make deals with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s whatever the magic that goes from basic elements</p>
<p>to things like consciousness and love.</p>
<p>Do you think one of the things I find</p>
<p>extremely beautiful and powerful is cellular automata,</p>
<p>which you also touch on?</p>
<p>Do you think whatever the heck happens in cellular automata</p>
<p>where interesting, complicated objects emerge,</p>
<p>God is in there too?</p>
<p>The emergence of love in this seemingly primitive universe?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the goal of creating a replicant</p>
<p>is that they would love you and you would love them.</p>
<p>There wouldn&rsquo;t be much point of doing it</p>
<p>if that didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>But all of it, I guess what I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>about cellular automata is it&rsquo;s primitive building blocks</p>
<p>and they somehow create beautiful things.</p>
<p>Is there some deep truth to that</p>
<p>about how our universe works?</p>
<p>Is the emergence from simple rules,</p>
<p>beautiful, complex objects can emerge?</p>
<p>Is that the thing that made us?</p>
<p>Yeah, well. As we went through</p>
<p>all the six phases of reality.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good way to look at it.</p>
<p>It does make some point to the whole value</p>
<p>of having a universe.</p>
<p>Do you think about your own mortality?</p>
<p>Are you afraid of it?</p>
<p>Yes, but I keep going back to my idea</p>
<p>of being able to expand human life quickly enough</p>
<p>in advance of our getting there, longevity escape velocity,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;re not quite at yet,</p>
<p>but I think we&rsquo;re actually pretty close,</p>
<p>particularly with, for example, doing simulated biology.</p>
<p>I think we can probably get there within,</p>
<p>say, by the end of this decade, and that&rsquo;s my goal.</p>
<p>Do you hope to achieve the longevity escape velocity?</p>
<p>Do you hope to achieve immortality?</p>
<p>Well, immortality is hard to say.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t really come on your program saying I&rsquo;ve done it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve achieved immortality because it&rsquo;s never forever.</p>
<p>A long time, a long time of living well.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;d like to actually advance</p>
<p>human life expectancy, advance my life expectancy</p>
<p>more than a year every year,</p>
<p>and I think we can get there within,</p>
<p>by the end of this decade.</p>
<p>How do you think we&rsquo;d do it?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s practical things in Transcend,</p>
<p>the nine steps to living well forever, your book.</p>
<p>You describe just that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s practical things like health,</p>
<p>exercise, all those things.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, we live in a body</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t last forever.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason why it can&rsquo;t, though,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re discovering things, I think, that will extend it.</p>
<p>But you do have to deal with,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve got various issues.</p>
<p>Went to Mexico 40 years ago, developed salmonella.</p>
<p>I created pancreatitis, which gave me</p>
<p>a strange form of diabetes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not type one diabetes, because it&rsquo;s an autoimmune</p>
<p>disorder that destroys your pancreas.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also not type two diabetes,</p>
<p>because type two diabetes is your pancreas works fine,</p>
<p>but your cells don&rsquo;t absorb the insulin well.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have that either.</p>
<p>The pancreatitis I had partially damaged my pancreas,</p>
<p>but it was a one time thing.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t continue, and I&rsquo;ve learned now how to control it.</p>
<p>But so that&rsquo;s just something that I had to do</p>
<p>in order to continue to exist.</p>
<p>Since your particular biological system,</p>
<p>you had to figure out a few hacks,</p>
<p>and the idea is that science would be able</p>
<p>to do that much better, actually.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I mean, I do spend a lot of time</p>
<p>just tinkering with my own body to keep it going.</p>
<p>So I do think I&rsquo;ll last till the end of this decade,</p>
<p>and I think we&rsquo;ll achieve longevity, escape velocity.</p>
<p>I think that we&rsquo;ll start with people</p>
<p>who are very diligent about this.</p>
<p>Eventually, it&rsquo;ll become sort of routine</p>
<p>that people will be able to do it.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re talking about kids today,</p>
<p>or even people in their 20s or 30s,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really not a very serious problem.</p>
<p>I have had some discussions with relatives</p>
<p>who are like almost 100, and saying,</p>
<p>well, we&rsquo;re working on it as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s gonna work.</p>
<p>Is there a case, this is a difficult question,</p>
<p>but is there a case to be made against living forever</p>
<p>that a finite life, that mortality is a feature, not a bug,</p>
<p>that living a shorter, so dying makes ice cream</p>
<p>taste delicious, makes life intensely beautiful</p>
<p>more than it otherwise might be?</p>
<p>Most people believe that way, except if you present</p>
<p>a death of anybody they care about or love,</p>
<p>they find that extremely depressing.</p>
<p>And I know people who feel that way</p>
<p>20, 30, 40 years later, they still want them back.</p>
<p>So I mean, death is not something to celebrate,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve lived in a world where people just accept this.</p>
<p>Life is short, you see it all the time on TV,</p>
<p>oh, life&rsquo;s short, you have to take advantage of it</p>
<p>and nobody accepts the fact that you could actually</p>
<p>go beyond normal lifetimes.</p>
<p>But anytime we talk about death or a death of a person,</p>
<p>even one death is a terrible tragedy.</p>
<p>If you have somebody that lives to 100 years old,</p>
<p>we still love them in return.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no limitation to that.</p>
<p>In fact, these kinds of trends are gonna provide</p>
<p>greater and greater opportunity for everybody,</p>
<p>even if we have more people.</p>
<p>So let me ask about an alien species</p>
<p>or a super intelligent AI 500 years from now</p>
<p>that will look back and remember Ray Kurzweil version zero.</p>
<p>Before the replicants spread,</p>
<p>how do you hope they remember you</p>
<p>in Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy summary of Ray Kurzweil?</p>
<p>What do you hope your legacy is?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I do hope to be around, so that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Some version of you, yes.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Do you think you&rsquo;ll be the same person around?</p>
<p>I mean, am I the same person I was when I was 20 or 10?</p>
<p>You would be the same person in that same way,</p>
<p>but yes, we&rsquo;re different, we&rsquo;re different.</p>
<p>All we have of that, all you have of that person</p>
<p>is your memories, which are probably distorted in some way.</p>
<p>Maybe you just remember the good parts,</p>
<p>depending on your psyche.</p>
<p>You might focus on the bad parts,</p>
<p>might focus on the good parts.</p>
<p>Right, but I mean, I still have a relationship</p>
<p>to the way I was when I was earlier, when I was younger.</p>
<p>How will you and the other super intelligent AIs</p>
<p>remember you of today from 500 years ago?</p>
<p>What do you hope to be remembered by this version of you</p>
<p>before the singularity?</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s expressed well in my books,</p>
<p>trying to create some new realities that people will accept.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s something that gives me great pleasure,</p>
<p>and greater insight into what makes humans valuable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the only person who&rsquo;s tempted to comment on that.</p>
<p>And optimism that permeates your work.</p>
<p>Optimism about the future is ultimately that optimism</p>
<p>paves the way for building a better future.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree with that.</p>
<p>So you asked your dad about the meaning of life,</p>
<p>and he said, love, let me ask you the same question.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Why are we here?</p>
<p>This beautiful journey that we&rsquo;re on in phase four,</p>
<p>reaching for phase five of this evolution</p>
<p>and information processing, why?</p>
<p>Well, I think I&rsquo;d give the same answers as my father.</p>
<p>Because if there were no love,</p>
<p>and we didn&rsquo;t care about anybody,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;d be no point existing.</p>
<p>Love is the meaning of life.</p>
<p>The AI version of your dad had a good point.</p>
<p>Well, I think that&rsquo;s a beautiful way to end it.</p>
<p>Ray, thank you for your work.</p>
<p>Thank you for being who you are.</p>
<p>Thank you for dreaming about a beautiful future</p>
<p>and creating it along the way.</p>
<p>And thank you so much for spending</p>
<p>your really valuable time with me today.</p>
<p>This was awesome.</p>
<p>It was my pleasure, and you have some great insights,</p>
<p>both into me and into humanity as well, so I appreciate that.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Ray Kurzweil.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Isaac Asimov.</p>
<p>It is change, continuous change, inevitable change</p>
<p>that is the dominant factor in society today.</p>
<p>No sensible decision can be made any longer</p>
<p>without taking into account not only the world as it is,</p>
<p>but the world as it will be.</p>
<p>This, in turn, means that our statesmen,</p>
<p>our businessmen, our everyman,</p>
<p>must take on a science fictional way of thinking.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
