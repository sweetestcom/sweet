<p>having a wonderful day so far my name is bailey</p>
<p>sarian and it&rsquo;s monday</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s murder mystery and makeup monday</p>
<p>if you are new here hi</p>
<p>every monday i sit down i talk about a true</p>
<p>crime story that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>heavy on my noggin</p>
<p>and i do my makeup at the same time</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in true</p>
<p>crime and you like makeup i would</p>
<p>definitely suggest you hit that subscribe button</p>
<p>anywho for today&rsquo;s</p>
<p>story i was reading my comment section as one does and</p>
<p>sammy aguilar</p>
<p>she said bailey can you please look into the pazuzu</p>
<p>algarard okay i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna look up how to say his last name</p>
<p>cause i forgot to do that algarard</p>
<p>case please</p>
<p>and i haven&rsquo;t heard of</p>
<p>pazuzu so i was like okay let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>google that and</p>
<p>whoo it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>story now they did recently i think it&rsquo;s vice</p>
<p>they actually</p>
<p>did like a little docuseries on it so if you have</p>
<p>heard this story</p>
<p>sorry i didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about it and i&rsquo;m sure if i didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about it maybe a handful of you out there don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about it as well so let&rsquo;s jump into it</p>
<p>but first disclaimer</p>
<p>the following presentation is intended</p>
<p>for mature audiences</p>
<p>it contains</p>
<p>graphic descriptions of</p>
<p>crime scenes</p>
<p>adult dialogue and</p>
<p>strong language viewer discretion is advised</p>
<p>oh also i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to lightly talk about</p>
<p>some things like animal cruelty</p>
<p>cannibalism</p>
<p>satan very lightly not</p>
<p>going into any</p>
<p>graphic details</p>
<p>about it but just a little heads up all</p>
<p>right okay i will shut up now</p>
<p>fear discretion is</p>
<p>advised this one is kind of nutso</p>
<p>never heard of this guy</p>
<p>and um it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>scary to think that there&rsquo;s people out there like this</p>
<p>john lawson was born august 12th 1978 in san</p>
<p>francisco baby</p>
<p>his parents cynthia lawson</p>
<p>and timothy lawson they had</p>
<p>married in 1971</p>
<p>and then they ended up moving to</p>
<p>north carolina</p>
<p>then they ended up getting divorced in</p>
<p>1990 cynthia</p>
<p>and her son john they continued to live in clemens</p>
<p>in north carolina</p>
<p>jesus i&rsquo;m sorry for that it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>every time i try to film something</p>
<p>just the lights like crack or something it&rsquo;s very weird</p>
<p>anyways so cynthia and her son john they had</p>
<p>lived in clemens in</p>
<p>north carolina</p>
<p>and the ex husband he moved back to california</p>
<p>he was like focus them out in nineteen ninety eight</p>
<p>cynthia the mother she remarried to a tennessee native</p>
<p>and his name was johnny</p>
<p>larry james</p>
<p>johnny james</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a great name they all live together</p>
<p>in winston salem</p>
<p>north carolina</p>
<p>now for john the main dude that we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about here his</p>
<p>childhood is</p>
<p>confusing because of a couple things</p>
<p>he constantly told different stories</p>
<p>as far as his upbringing goes he was all over the</p>
<p>place he seemed to be like</p>
<p>a little bit of a</p>
<p>liar a fibber</p>
<p>and he would constantly make</p>
<p>things up to just impress everyone around him</p>
<p>so for example john here he</p>
<p>claimed that he was from iraq</p>
<p>and then he also</p>
<p>claimed that his father was a priest</p>
<p>he claimed that his real father died he</p>
<p>claimed that he</p>
<p>lived in different</p>
<p>states it was just he was all over the place</p>
<p>based off of what cynthia his</p>
<p>mother says we do know well she</p>
<p>would say that</p>
<p>john was known to be more of an emotional</p>
<p>child and he would</p>
<p>march to the beat of a different drum</p>
<p>now cynthia</p>
<p>would go on to say that john</p>
<p>would practice harming animals during his childhood</p>
<p>and he also</p>
<p>would experiment with drugs and alcohol</p>
<p>now this did</p>
<p>worry cynthia and we all know this</p>
<p>well in the true</p>
<p>crime community i feel like</p>
<p>usually if a</p>
<p>child is participating in harming animals that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never a good sign</p>
<p>ever and this</p>
<p>worried cynthia</p>
<p>so she actually</p>
<p>wanted to get him help she was like this kid is</p>
<p>killing animals he needs help</p>
<p>so she did the</p>
<p>right thing she</p>
<p>took him to see a</p>
<p>psychiatrist</p>
<p>and make sure that john</p>
<p>would get some help</p>
<p>and john was diagnosed as</p>
<p>agoraphobic</p>
<p>and the definition</p>
<p>of that is somebody who has an irrational fear of</p>
<p>entering open or</p>
<p>crowded places</p>
<p>somebody who</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t like to</p>
<p>leave their home</p>
<p>and he was also diagnosed as a</p>
<p>schizophrenic</p>
<p>and had manic depression</p>
<p>and this was at a</p>
<p>young age so cynthia his</p>
<p>mother john&rsquo;s mother</p>
<p>she did take him to see</p>
<p>a therapist and make sure that he got some kind of help</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the problem</p>
<p>she had to take him out</p>
<p>of getting professional</p>
<p>help because she couldn&rsquo;t afford it anymore it was</p>
<p>becoming way too expensive so unfortunately</p>
<p>this is where america sucks you know</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t afford it anymore</p>
<p>so then john over here decided to drop out of high</p>
<p>school and then legally change his name</p>
<p>and he changed it to pazuzu</p>
<p>ila algarid</p>
<p>and when he got this new name he was now a devoted</p>
<p>satanist and</p>
<p>drug dealer now pazuzu is the name of the king of</p>
<p>demons in ancient</p>
<p>mesopotamian</p>
<p>mythology also is heavily</p>
<p>featured in pop culture</p>
<p>most prominently</p>
<p>in the exorcist remember</p>
<p>side note i also forgot to mention this now pazuzu</p>
<p>claim to be a satanist</p>
<p>selective outrage happens here</p>
<p>and if you are</p>
<p>a practicing satanist</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>harming anybody do whatever makes you</p>
<p>happy you know</p>
<p>do what makes you happy</p>
<p>now this story</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean all satanists</p>
<p>are like this</p>
<p>this story doesn&rsquo;t reflect</p>
<p>this religion as a</p>
<p>whole and in almost</p>
<p>every video</p>
<p>it seems like</p>
<p>a religion is mentioned because people belong to</p>
<p>whichever church of</p>
<p>their choosing</p>
<p>but never am i trying to</p>
<p>paint the picture of what this religion is</p>
<p>i believe that there are some really nice</p>
<p>satanists out</p>
<p>there and i&rsquo;m sure they mean no harm and they just mind</p>
<p>their own business and do</p>
<p>their own thing</p>
<p>do you understand what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>back to the</p>
<p>story puzuzu over here he liked</p>
<p>being scary</p>
<p>he liked making</p>
<p>others feel uncomfortable</p>
<p>he was well</p>
<p>known for being different</p>
<p>and off putting and he</p>
<p>would brag a lot</p>
<p>about his counter</p>
<p>culture practices</p>
<p>like sacrificing animals</p>
<p>he claimed that he had the power</p>
<p>of weather control</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like yeah</p>
<p>bitch i can make it snow watch</p>
<p>pazuzu over here</p>
<p>he was like</p>
<p>i need to just really amp up this</p>
<p>this character</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;m creating he filed his</p>
<p>teeth down to look different and like super</p>
<p>sharp so he filed his</p>
<p>teeth to look</p>
<p>sharp and he used a dremel</p>
<p>to do so also</p>
<p>pazuzu decided to get his tongue split</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if he did it himself or he got it done</p>
<p>professionally but regardless he</p>
<p>split his tongue and then he got</p>
<p>some pretty</p>
<p>thick ass tatties on his face bro</p>
<p>of course pazuzu over here was one of</p>
<p>those idiots who idolized</p>
<p>charles manson</p>
<p>my least favorite people on the planet</p>
<p>he just really looked up to charles</p>
<p>and how charles</p>
<p>was able to gain a following and was idolized</p>
<p>and he liked the fact that charles was able to</p>
<p>get people to do bad</p>
<p>things for him</p>
<p>so his hands</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t dirty</p>
<p>this is when i will mention</p>
<p>again get better</p>
<p>idols charles manson was a</p>
<p>loser sorry</p>
<p>come for me now pazuzu over here was like</p>
<p>idea i should</p>
<p>start a new religion</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never been like done before i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna mix lucifercism</p>
<p>sam lucifer</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna mix</p>
<p>luciferianism</p>
<p>and islam together</p>
<p>and create something new</p>
<p>now it really had nothing to do with the ideals of</p>
<p>these two religions he just wanted to use them to</p>
<p>scare the community he knew people feared satanism</p>
<p>luciferyunism</p>
<p>because the devil</p>
<p>and people are afraid of the devil</p>
<p>so he was like okay i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna take that and then he</p>
<p>chose the islam religion because</p>
<p>this was now in 2002</p>
<p>and 9 11 had just happened the year prior</p>
<p>at that time</p>
<p>unfortunately there was a lot of fear</p>
<p>about terrorists and</p>
<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>so he purposely picked</p>
<p>these two religions that people</p>
<p>feared the most</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna make my own</p>
<p>religion out of</p>
<p>these two pazuzu</p>
<p>was really it like on a downward spiral</p>
<p>and he was unable to financially seek</p>
<p>any sort of help</p>
<p>for what was</p>
<p>going on in his</p>
<p>noggin because</p>
<p>he was really suffering and struggling with</p>
<p>schizophrenia</p>
<p>his manic depression</p>
<p>and he was just not</p>
<p>taking care of himself it&rsquo;s sad</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s like okay well i need followers</p>
<p>i need people</p>
<p>to come to my new church</p>
<p>and support me</p>
<p>so he began to surround himself with people</p>
<p>of lower class</p>
<p>he would refer to them as</p>
<p>the misfits</p>
<p>and the outcasts and</p>
<p>these people were very vulnerable due to</p>
<p>their status</p>
<p>a lot of them</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t working a lot of them were addicted</p>
<p>to drugs a lot of people were doing meth or heroin</p>
<p>he felt like</p>
<p>they were easy to control because for one he</p>
<p>could invite them into his home</p>
<p>let them do drugs and stuff</p>
<p>and of course they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna keep coming back because it was like a</p>
<p>place for all them to hang</p>
<p>out and do drugs people were really attracted to pazuzu</p>
<p>and how rebellious</p>
<p>he was and the fact that he was very defiant</p>
<p>and he seemed like very dangerous he was unpredictable</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t believe he</p>
<p>changed his name to pazuzu</p>
<p>who does that</p>
<p>people were constantly coming and</p>
<p>going in the home oh</p>
<p>also cynthia</p>
<p>and her new husband they had</p>
<p>moved out at some</p>
<p>point and like</p>
<p>he still owned the</p>
<p>house but pazuzu was living there</p>
<p>cynthia the</p>
<p>mother would come and go and just</p>
<p>check up on</p>
<p>him to see how he&rsquo;s doing but for the most part cynthia</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t there it was mainly pazuzu&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house i feel</p>
<p>ridiculous saying pazuzu</p>
<p>now a lot of people</p>
<p>in the community</p>
<p>would find him</p>
<p>from word of</p>
<p>mouth friends would call</p>
<p>other friends</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d be like hey yeah this dude is cool</p>
<p>he like drinks</p>
<p>blood and shit come</p>
<p>check out this</p>
<p>place with me</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how they</p>
<p>would constantly get new people</p>
<p>one of pazuzu&rsquo;s friends or followers said</p>
<p>quote we just hung out and</p>
<p>chilled around</p>
<p>and whatnot</p>
<p>maybe did a little bit of heroin</p>
<p>every now and</p>
<p>again just a</p>
<p>crazy shit ton of</p>
<p>drinking cut ourselves and each</p>
<p>other maybe</p>
<p>drink the blood of a bird or</p>
<p>whatever just</p>
<p>all around having a good time there were no rules you</p>
<p>could piss in his carpet</p>
<p>you could smash a tv</p>
<p>you could hit somebody in the head with a beer bottle</p>
<p>it just didn&rsquo;t matter end</p>
<p>quote so a lot of people thought and knew that pezuzu</p>
<p>was like a compulsive</p>
<p>liar and that he was just trying to keep up with this</p>
<p>scary image he had</p>
<p>like he would</p>
<p>claim that he killed people he</p>
<p>ate their bodies</p>
<p>and that he burned them or buried them in the backyard</p>
<p>but people didn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>think anything like of it they just thought he was</p>
<p>lying but also you have to remember a lot of</p>
<p>these people were on drugs</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably not in the</p>
<p>right headspace to be taking any of this seriously</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>story was just always changing</p>
<p>he was always killing people</p>
<p>and eating them and everybody was just kind of like</p>
<p>okay now what exactly the religion</p>
<p>entailed i&rsquo;m not sure like</p>
<p>i couldn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>find clarification because i don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>think there</p>
<p>was much that this like an outline to this religion</p>
<p>but i do know that people</p>
<p>would come over to the</p>
<p>house and they</p>
<p>would participate in animal sacrifice</p>
<p>you shouldn&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>over time pazuzu</p>
<p>gained a pretty like</p>
<p>good amount of lady followers and he</p>
<p>would call the lady followers his fiances</p>
<p>and he dated or</p>
<p>slept with almost all of them he would</p>
<p>sleep with anyone he</p>
<p>could i mean these</p>
<p>women would like</p>
<p>idolize him so of course he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna take advantage of that and get off</p>
<p>pazuzo just really liked</p>
<p>all this attention he was getting and the fact that</p>
<p>he was the boss and he like ran shit</p>
<p>around here people were listening to him</p>
<p>he was in charge</p>
<p>he was weird and he was an outcast</p>
<p>and he claimed that he liked being</p>
<p>weird in an outcast but the end of the day i</p>
<p>think people</p>
<p>in general this is</p>
<p>a complete opinion but i</p>
<p>think people in general they like being acknowledged</p>
<p>they like being liked</p>
<p>they want it they want that</p>
<p>and they want a</p>
<p>sense of community as well</p>
<p>so when i think he</p>
<p>found like his</p>
<p>tribe he was just</p>
<p>milking it and the fact that he would say</p>
<p>things like</p>
<p>i ate a person i burn them in the backyard</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>would get a reaction like oh my god</p>
<p>whoa i could</p>
<p>never do that</p>
<p>inflating his ego</p>
<p>and then he was</p>
<p>sleeping with a bunch of</p>
<p>chicks yeah you know his ego was out of control</p>
<p>pazuzu claimed that he only bathed</p>
<p>once a year and that he</p>
<p>never brushed his</p>
<p>teeth inside of the home</p>
<p>where they practice their</p>
<p>drug taking and</p>
<p>animal sacrifices he was also</p>
<p>known to keep piles of feces in the corner of his</p>
<p>house rather than use the bathroom</p>
<p>or if they had to go pee or something they</p>
<p>would just go in the corner of his</p>
<p>house like inside of the house</p>
<p>so the house probably</p>
<p>smelled real nice</p>
<p>so pazuzu was just not taking care of himself</p>
<p>and his followers did the same</p>
<p>thing they didn&rsquo;t need a shower</p>
<p>they had the power of</p>
<p>satan to cleanse them</p>
<p>this is also just an opinion because i&rsquo;m not even sure</p>
<p>but i bet you a million</p>
<p>bucks they probably just didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>money to pay the</p>
<p>water bill so</p>
<p>they were like yeah we&rsquo;re just gonna pee in the</p>
<p>house yeah but really they didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>water i would put money on that and</p>
<p>but i cannot confirm or deny that</p>
<p>but i couldn&rsquo;t imagine what that house</p>
<p>smells like</p>
<p>actually i don&rsquo;t wanna know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t wanna know that now when new people</p>
<p>would come to pazuzu&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>their first comment</p>
<p>would be like oh my god what is that</p>
<p>smell it smells like</p>
<p>death in here</p>
<p>and pazuzu would be like yeah it&rsquo;s the dead</p>
<p>bodies in the basement</p>
<p>now cynthia</p>
<p>pazuzu&rsquo;s mother</p>
<p>she would go by the home and</p>
<p>check on him to</p>
<p>see how he&rsquo;s doing you know because it is her son and</p>
<p>she knows mentally he&rsquo;s just not in a good place</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s her home so she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going by to</p>
<p>check on and see like how he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>so in may 2010</p>
<p>cynthia goes</p>
<p>by the home they get into some kind of argument</p>
<p>and then pezuzu comes up and he strangles her to the</p>
<p>point where she</p>
<p>knocks out so cynthia calls the police</p>
<p>and then the police come</p>
<p>and they arrest pazuzu</p>
<p>and then they ask cynthia like do you</p>
<p>wanna press charges or whatever</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s like no i don&rsquo;t wanna</p>
<p>press charges i mean she feels guilty it&rsquo;s her son</p>
<p>so she decides not to</p>
<p>press charges</p>
<p>now the home that pazuzu was in</p>
<p>where he was practicing and had everyone come over</p>
<p>it was wall to wall covered</p>
<p>in nonsense whether it be just posters of like satanic</p>
<p>symbols there</p>
<p>would be drawings all over the walls with like</p>
<p>sharpies of just</p>
<p>nonsense they look to be</p>
<p>smears of when they sacrificed an animal</p>
<p>like they would</p>
<p>smear the blood on the walls</p>
<p>in this group they</p>
<p>would cut themselves they</p>
<p>would take that and</p>
<p>smear it on the walls</p>
<p>they had their own little</p>
<p>decor so in</p>
<p>2011 pazuzu actually ends up getting arrested in the</p>
<p>connection of the shooting</p>
<p>death of joseph</p>
<p>chandler joseph was</p>
<p>found dead by the yadkin</p>
<p>river this is</p>
<p>where pazuzu</p>
<p>allegedly indulged in</p>
<p>black magic rituals and animal sacrifices</p>
<p>pazuzu would say</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a full moon</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the night that they</p>
<p>would kill so the</p>
<p>night that joseph</p>
<p>was shot and killed it was a full moon</p>
<p>he was minding his own business</p>
<p>apparently he was just trying to</p>
<p>light a cigarette like he was outside he was trying to</p>
<p>light a cigarette</p>
<p>and before he</p>
<p>could light it he got shot</p>
<p>pazuzu was also with</p>
<p>his friend and one</p>
<p>of his followers</p>
<p>and his friend is the one who shot the gun</p>
<p>pazuzu was just there allegedly</p>
<p>so his friend that was with them his name is nicholas</p>
<p>and he actually</p>
<p>was convicted of involuntary manslaughter</p>
<p>while pazuzu was</p>
<p>charged with accessory</p>
<p>after the fact of involuntary manslaughter</p>
<p>now pazuzu was convicted in</p>
<p>2011 and sentenced to just probation</p>
<p>and the other dude</p>
<p>was locked up</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the kicker pazuzu</p>
<p>when he was arrested he was</p>
<p>taken and given a</p>
<p>psychiatric</p>
<p>evaluation now this</p>
<p>psychiatric</p>
<p>evaluation was accidentally released to the media</p>
<p>how it was accidentally</p>
<p>released i don&rsquo;t know but it was</p>
<p>so they put out there all this information</p>
<p>about pazuzu to the public it shows us</p>
<p>long list of</p>
<p>mental illnesses that pazuzu was struggling with</p>
<p>in these notes it described</p>
<p>how pazuzu when he came in he</p>
<p>smelled like poop</p>
<p>and claim to not bathe in a year</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m laughing because</p>
<p>they use the</p>
<p>word poop and for some reason that made me laugh</p>
<p>because i am a 10 year old boy and i don&rsquo;t know why</p>
<p>also it showed that he had serious issues or struggles</p>
<p>with drug and alcohol</p>
<p>abuse talked</p>
<p>about how pazuzu had killed many animals he</p>
<p>drank animal</p>
<p>blood he drank</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s blood</p>
<p>like their his followers they would</p>
<p>cut themselves and he</p>
<p>would drink</p>
<p>their blood</p>
<p>went on to describe</p>
<p>how he choked his</p>
<p>mother and he wanted</p>
<p>to kill people it showed the community it showed the</p>
<p>media that really</p>
<p>should have been</p>
<p>kept people were really terrified</p>
<p>of this guy but for some reason he got a slap on the</p>
<p>wrist and five years probation</p>
<p>for this murder that he was a part of</p>
<p>when people find this out they&rsquo;re just outraged i</p>
<p>think anybody</p>
<p>would because what the hell was that all</p>
<p>about like why</p>
<p>why why now</p>
<p>sadly out here in america if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>watching from a</p>
<p>different country hey what&rsquo;s up we have a really shitty</p>
<p>healthcare system we don&rsquo;t really have</p>
<p>psychiatric hospitals at all</p>
<p>we have jail</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where a lot of</p>
<p>these people end up sadly</p>
<p>and a lot of them don&rsquo;t belong there</p>
<p>they are mentally</p>
<p>ill and they need help for that and i do believe that</p>
<p>in this case like he</p>
<p>really should have been placed in a</p>
<p>psychiatric hospital or something right but</p>
<p>there really isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>an option for that</p>
<p>for some odd reason</p>
<p>jail wasn&rsquo;t an option either</p>
<p>so of course once</p>
<p>all this shit goes down and they look back at pazuzu&rsquo;s</p>
<p>story and they see this</p>
<p>where they had the opportunity to lock him up</p>
<p>it pisses a lot of people off</p>
<p>now enter into the</p>
<p>scene josh wetzler</p>
<p>so according to josh&rsquo;s ex</p>
<p>girlfriend he was</p>
<p>known to be a hippie</p>
<p>and he loved the grateful dead</p>
<p>he loved attending</p>
<p>music festivals</p>
<p>and him as previous</p>
<p>girlfriend her name is stacy</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry her</p>
<p>name is stacy they also had a son together but josh</p>
<p>also seemed to head down a bit of a downward spiral</p>
<p>he started doing drugs daily</p>
<p>which then led to him receiving a felony</p>
<p>drug charge</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t really seem to be doing all too</p>
<p>great one day josh just</p>
<p>went missing gone</p>
<p>vanish poof</p>
<p>kalamazoo gone</p>
<p>the last time he was seen was by stacy</p>
<p>in july of two thousand nine</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know how i feel</p>
<p>about this one but i&rsquo;m not judging i can&rsquo;t judge</p>
<p>stacy his former</p>
<p>girlfriend reported him missing six</p>
<p>months after he didn&rsquo;t contact the family yes</p>
<p>you heard that</p>
<p>right kitty cats six</p>
<p>months so when i</p>
<p>first read that i was like</p>
<p>but i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>judge because i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>their lives and stacy</p>
<p>claimed that</p>
<p>it was kind of normal for him to just up and</p>
<p>leave one day and go on a road trip</p>
<p>and just disappear for a few</p>
<p>months so she really didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think anything</p>
<p>of it and that&rsquo;s why she waited six months</p>
<p>but when josh didn&rsquo;t contact anyone for christmas</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when the red flag went up and she</p>
<p>was like okay something&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong because he would</p>
<p>never miss a holiday</p>
<p>pazuzu to me just</p>
<p>sounds like</p>
<p>a dessert oh that&rsquo;s pazuki</p>
<p>anywho stacy became even more concerned</p>
<p>when she heard a</p>
<p>rumor that pazuzu had</p>
<p>killed josh and buried him in the backyard</p>
<p>people were talking</p>
<p>these followers</p>
<p>of pazuzu were saying oh he killed a guy</p>
<p>and this got back to stacy</p>
<p>cause i mean it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>small town so people people are talking</p>
<p>stacy goes straight</p>
<p>to the police and she&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>rumors going around that pazuzu person</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s in your files</p>
<p>killed josh</p>
<p>and buried him in the backyard</p>
<p>you do something</p>
<p>about that then we have another</p>
<p>missing person</p>
<p>named tommy welch</p>
<p>now tommy was</p>
<p>known to love working on cars and</p>
<p>building car</p>
<p>stereos and he had no</p>
<p>known issues with drugs or alcohol</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of sad</p>
<p>but like that&rsquo;s really all the info i</p>
<p>could find on tommy</p>
<p>sorry tommy</p>
<p>but tommy&rsquo;s family</p>
<p>had plans to meet to have like a</p>
<p>movie night</p>
<p>tommy had been at his brother&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>previously that same day</p>
<p>and then when he didn&rsquo;t return from</p>
<p>movie night</p>
<p>this was extremely unlike</p>
<p>tommy and it made his family instantly</p>
<p>grow concerned and then they reported him missing</p>
<p>pretty quickly</p>
<p>october of 2009</p>
<p>so what do these two people have to do with pazuzu</p>
<p>well one night pazuzu just decided to abduct</p>
<p>josh for seemingly</p>
<p>no reason in 2009</p>
<p>it was gonna be done as some kind of sacrifice</p>
<p>josh was then kept in the basement of puzuzu&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house for a few days</p>
<p>where he was</p>
<p>starved nobody fed him nobody</p>
<p>really paid attention to him he was</p>
<p>chained now</p>
<p>after a few days</p>
<p>poor josh was shot six times by a shotgun</p>
<p>pezuzu was the</p>
<p>one who shot him pezuzu and his fiance&rsquo;s remember the</p>
<p>women followers</p>
<p>they then took josh and dismembered his body</p>
<p>and they buried josh in the backyard</p>
<p>then a few months</p>
<p>later they needed another sacrifice</p>
<p>so pezuzu and a few of his followers</p>
<p>abducted tommy</p>
<p>and the same thing</p>
<p>they kept him in the basement they</p>
<p>starved him and then they shot him</p>
<p>they dismembered</p>
<p>tommy&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>and then they buried him in the backyard this upset</p>
<p>a lot of people</p>
<p>for a couple</p>
<p>reasons because pazuzu was constantly bragging</p>
<p>that he killed people and buried them in his backyard</p>
<p>and he also told</p>
<p>people oh it&rsquo;s the dead body in my basement remember</p>
<p>so he was telling the</p>
<p>truth but nobody took him seriously</p>
<p>which is like</p>
<p>so when they find out it&rsquo;s all true it&rsquo;s like shit</p>
<p>so one of his followers</p>
<p>actually had like a moment of clarity</p>
<p>he was like i need to tell the police</p>
<p>puzuzu was getting</p>
<p>out of control he wanted to kill more people and he was</p>
<p>becoming a lot more aggressive</p>
<p>towards his followers as well so</p>
<p>this guy who was one of the followers was like okay i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna go to</p>
<p>police and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna speak</p>
<p>so this follower goes to the police</p>
<p>and the police go to</p>
<p>search puzuzu&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>or elise&rsquo;s property and</p>
<p>the police said like the</p>
<p>smell of the</p>
<p>place was absolutely disgusting but they found</p>
<p>nothing so they left</p>
<p>now over time</p>
<p>more and more tips came in</p>
<p>to police about pazuzu</p>
<p>sadly of course</p>
<p>like in almost all of</p>
<p>these stories</p>
<p>police ignored</p>
<p>these tips they really didn&rsquo;t take them seriously</p>
<p>pazuzu&rsquo;s own</p>
<p>mother cynthia</p>
<p>tried to inform</p>
<p>police stating that many people told her</p>
<p>her son had</p>
<p>killed people and buried them in the backyard</p>
<p>finally on october fifth</p>
<p>2014 nine ten eleven to five years later</p>
<p>police obtained a second</p>
<p>search warrant and decided to do another search</p>
<p>and looked into</p>
<p>the backyard so police go to pazuzu&rsquo;s home and they</p>
<p>search the backyard finally police discovered the</p>
<p>skeletal remains of josh and</p>
<p>tommy welch</p>
<p>so pazuzu and two of his fiance&rsquo;s amber</p>
<p>nicole birch and crystal matlock were arrested in</p>
<p>connection to the murders april 2015</p>
<p>the zoo zoo&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house was demolished because it was unlivable and</p>
<p>disgusting the neighbors were</p>
<p>happy because the home was an eyesore</p>
<p>and you know neighbors care</p>
<p>so much about</p>
<p>their property</p>
<p>value going down because of an eyesore home</p>
<p>so they were</p>
<p>excited that</p>
<p>it was being demolished and taken down</p>
<p>pezuzu&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>would only be</p>
<p>deemed livable</p>
<p>after 78 000</p>
<p>worth of repairs</p>
<p>and removal</p>
<p>of mold that was growing in the home</p>
<p>a report that was filed by the</p>
<p>county housing</p>
<p>and community development department describes the</p>
<p>house as containing broken glass</p>
<p>sharp instruments</p>
<p>hundreds of</p>
<p>flies there were a shit</p>
<p>ton of decayed animal parts</p>
<p>animal cages</p>
<p>with carcasses</p>
<p>the report also noted</p>
<p>dried blood</p>
<p>that was like on the walls</p>
<p>wall art because it was cynthia&rsquo;s home they gave her</p>
<p>a 30 day deadline</p>
<p>and then if she didn&rsquo;t pay that</p>
<p>the house was</p>
<p>gonna be demolished</p>
<p>so which it</p>
<p>ended up being demolished why</p>
<p>cynthia wasn&rsquo;t responsible for anything i&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>i think she</p>
<p>truly had no idea what was</p>
<p>going on but i also</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t pazuzu</p>
<p>ended up committing suicide on</p>
<p>october 25th</p>
<p>2015 before his trial</p>
<p>leaving his</p>
<p>victims families</p>
<p>with many questions and no answers</p>
<p>really rude</p>
<p>so many believe that pazuzu killed a lot more</p>
<p>than just those two people</p>
<p>there was a</p>
<p>woman that lived with him for a</p>
<p>month and she was also one of his fiance&rsquo;s and</p>
<p>and she said that pazuzu</p>
<p>claimed to have killed</p>
<p>burned and buried the</p>
<p>bodies of two prostitutes</p>
<p>or sex workers i</p>
<p>should say sorry</p>
<p>unfortunately because pazuzu</p>
<p>did take his own life nobody</p>
<p>truly knows what was going on</p>
<p>why he was doing</p>
<p>those things</p>
<p>what exactly was</p>
<p>going on like nobody really knows and nobody also knows</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t i&rsquo;m not trying to</p>
<p>laugh but like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know why i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>laughing but nobody also knows why were</p>
<p>those two men</p>
<p>targeted like why them that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>story about pezuzu</p>
<p>one of my biggest</p>
<p>fears is just a killer who kills at random</p>
<p>you know a lot of killers they tend to kill people</p>
<p>close to them kill people that they know</p>
<p>but this dude seemed to just kind of pick some</p>
<p>random people</p>
<p>and that stuff is</p>
<p>scary what can you look out for</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>and the worst part of all</p>
<p>and what makes people really mad is that all of this</p>
<p>could have been prevented</p>
<p>if simply they</p>
<p>would have arrested and kept pazuzu</p>
<p>in jail for the</p>
<p>first murder that he committed</p>
<p>i keep telling myself</p>
<p>every monday</p>
<p>video i wanna</p>
<p>leave with like something what can we</p>
<p>learn from this</p>
<p>and like protect ourselves or what can we learn to</p>
<p>look out for and stuff</p>
<p>and honestly some of</p>
<p>these stories i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know don&rsquo;t do drugs</p>
<p>please be careful i don&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i need your help on this one you guys</p>
<p>what do you think</p>
<p>about pazuzu</p>
<p>thank you so much for hanging out with me today</p>
<p>please please please be safe out there</p>
