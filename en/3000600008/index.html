Okay. So, good afternoon everyone,
and welcome to today&amp;rsquo;s Dean Speaker Series.
I am really absolutely delighted to welcome today&amp;rsquo;s speaker,
Mary Nichols.
Very exciting.
Mary has been described
as the most influential environmental regulator in history,
and she&amp;rsquo;s known as California&amp;rsquo;s #CleanAir guru.
She pushed forward clean air and decarbonization programs
under four California governors.
And as we know, where California goes,
there goes the United States.'>

    <p>(people chattering)</p>
<ul>
<li>Okay.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, good afternoon everyone,</p>
<p>and welcome to today&rsquo;s Dean Speaker Series.</p>
<p>I am really absolutely delighted to welcome today&rsquo;s speaker,</p>
<p>Mary Nichols.</p>
<p>Very exciting.</p>
<p>Mary has been described</p>
<p>as the most influential environmental regulator in history,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s known as California&rsquo;s #CleanAir guru.</p>
<p>She pushed forward clean air and decarbonization programs</p>
<p>under four California governors.</p>
<p>And as we know, where California goes,</p>
<p>there goes the United States.</p>
<p>Mary is perhaps most famous</p>
<p>for her long tenure</p>
<p>as the chair of the California Air Resources Board,</p>
<p>which runs California&rsquo;s renowned Cap-and-Trade Program,</p>
<p>which we will talk about more shortly.</p>
<p>Today, Mary serves with Ford CEO Jim Foley</p>
<p>as the co-chair of the Coalition for Reimagined Mobility,</p>
<p>and as vice chair</p>
<p>of the California-China Climate Institute,</p>
<p>with former governor Jerry Brown</p>
<p>of California. - Right.</p>
<ul>
<li>During her leadership</li>
</ul>
<p>at the California Air Resources Board,</p>
<p>California became a national and global leader,</p>
<p>developing clean energy and clean transportation solutions</p>
<p>that many other states and nations</p>
<p>have consequently adopted.</p>
<p>Mary has a deep understanding</p>
<p>of what businesses will need to do</p>
<p>to lead and support the many transformations</p>
<p>of our economy,</p>
<p>that will be necessary to avert the looming climate crisis.</p>
<p>Here at Haas,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about sustainability and climate change a lot,</p>
<p>in particular, how businesses and industry</p>
<p>can take a leading role</p>
<p>in developing a sustainable climate-resilient economy.</p>
<p>We know that every aspect of business,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s agriculture, real estate,</p>
<p>energy, finance, corporations,</p>
<p>will need to be reimagined,</p>
<p>and will need to be redesigned,</p>
<p>to address the current environmental, social,</p>
<p>and economic crisis.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s conversation,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be exploring that question,</p>
<p>and in particular, how government policy</p>
<p>can work with industry,</p>
<p>and the critical role that policy will play</p>
<p>along with business in this transition.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, Mary,</p>
<p>for taking the time to be with us here today.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thank you. - We are absolutely thrilled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks for inviting me.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(audience applauding)</p>
<ul>
<li>So, Mary, let&rsquo;s start a little bit with your background.</li>
</ul>
<p>You studied law at Yale,</p>
<p>the greatest law school in the country.</p>
<p>Your first job after law school in 1971</p>
<p>was at the Center for Law in the Public Interest</p>
<p>in Los Angeles,</p>
<p>working as the air lawyer.</p>
<p>Now, what drew you to environmental issues,</p>
<p>rather than some other area of the law,</p>
<p>when there was not even such a thing</p>
<p>as an environmental lawyer?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, first of all,</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important to recognize,</p>
<p>for many people, including me,</p>
<p>when you actually look back on your career,</p>
<p>you realize that a lot of it was based on avoidance,</p>
<p>as opposed to attraction.</p>
<p>(audience laughing) That is,</p>
<p>I did not want to go work for a corporate law firm,</p>
<p>which is what most people did</p>
<p>when you graduate from a school like Yale Law School,</p>
<p>especially if you have loans.</p>
<p>But even if you didn&rsquo;t have big loans to pay off,</p>
<p>the feeling when I graduated in 1971,</p>
<p>was we were gonna be making policy for the country.</p>
<p>Because this was a time, you know,</p>
<p>right at the sort of peak, in many ways,</p>
<p>of the civil rights movement,</p>
<p>when people thought that law could be a force for good,</p>
<p>for social change.</p>
<p>Not just not bad, but actually,</p>
<p>the way that you could go about making change happen</p>
<p>was as a lawyer,</p>
<p>you could think of a good theory and go to court.</p>
<p>You could have clients</p>
<p>that had not previously had access to the law,</p>
<p>and make law for them using existing statutes.</p>
<p>So, it was a time when going to law school</p>
<p>was considered a progressive thing to do.</p>
<p>And I certainly didn&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>thinking that I was going to make a lot of money.</p>
<p>I came from, this is, you know,</p>
<p>probably more than you need to know,</p>
<p>but my parents were first-generation college graduates,</p>
<p>so my grandparents were the immigrants,</p>
<p>and they were the blue-collar union people.</p>
<p>My parents both went to college,</p>
<p>actually got advanced degrees and became teachers.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m kind of the next wave.</p>
<p>My brother is a doctor and I&rsquo;m a lawyer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the perfect, (laughs) the perfect storm, right?</p>
<p>The perfect scenario for Jewish parents.</p>
<p>They got one of each. (audience laughing)</p>
<p>So, bottom line is when I went to law school,</p>
<p>I had had experience working in the civil rights movement,</p>
<p>and working in a foundation</p>
<p>that was involved in criminal justice reform.</p>
<p>And I was very interested in both of those things.</p>
<p>But as it happened,</p>
<p>I was also moving to Los Angeles,</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause I&rsquo;d gotten married to somebody</p>
<p>who wanted to move to LA,</p>
<p>and I was very happy about that anyway,</p>
<p>from a pure, you know, physical comfort.</p>
<p>I was very happy to get away from the winters</p>
<p>on the East Coast.</p>
<p>And so I went looking for a job.</p>
<p>And what was happening at that time,</p>
<p>what was going on,</p>
<p>was the beginnings of the environmental movement.</p>
<p>So, I found a way through air pollution, I think,</p>
<p>to link social action and environmental protection.</p>
<p>So, I wasn&rsquo;t, in those days, you know,</p>
<p>a conservation lawyer.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t so interested as some of my colleagues were</p>
<p>in preserving things, you know?</p>
<p>I wanted to be involved in, before it even had a name,</p>
<p>really, in promoting community justice</p>
<p>through the environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you for that.</li>
</ul>
<p>And we&rsquo;re all so fortunate that you made that decision.</p>
<p>California has really benefited.</p>
<p>So, along those same lines,</p>
<p>what do you see</p>
<p>as some of the most important sustainability challenges</p>
<p>that our students here,</p>
<p>in this business school,</p>
<p>are likely to encounter</p>
<p>as they become business leaders?</p>
<p>And in particular,</p>
<p>what role do you see for private companies</p>
<p>to actually lead the transition to clean energy,</p>
<p>in a low carbon economy?</p>
<ul>
<li>I was at a dinner not too long ago,</li>
</ul>
<p>with a man who&rsquo;s made a fortune as an investor,</p>
<p>and is one of a number of people like that</p>
<p>who are giving money towards environmental protection</p>
<p>and towards climate change in particular.</p>
<p>And he expressed the opinion</p>
<p>that capitalism was incapable</p>
<p>of dealing with climate change.</p>
<p>And he wasn&rsquo;t actually being facetious.</p>
<p>He was, he has come to the point in his own evaluation</p>
<p>of the world,</p>
<p>that he really didn&rsquo;t think that there was a way</p>
<p>that you could harness capitalist impulses,</p>
<p>or to the system,</p>
<p>and address what needs to be done</p>
<p>in order to deal with the ongoing crisis</p>
<p>of climate change. - But do you feel</p>
<p>that way too?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, I&rsquo;m close to it. (laughs)</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s impossible,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s because I have a career and a history</p>
<p>as a regulator,</p>
<p>and I do believe regulation</p>
<p>can contain the worst of capitalism,</p>
<p>and still allow for the best of it.</p>
<p>So, in other words,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen anything</p>
<p>that made me think that China or Russia,</p>
<p>when Russia was still a place that you could talk about,</p>
<p>is gonna do better than we are</p>
<p>at dealing with climate change at all.</p>
<p>But I do think that the current political climate,</p>
<p>which is one where governments are incapable</p>
<p>of mustering the political will</p>
<p>to act in a way that puts a check on capitalism,</p>
<p>and are relying completely on voluntary actions,</p>
<p>will not succeed.</p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t succeeded yet,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think it, I don&rsquo;t think it will.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, the government isn&rsquo;t succeeding,</li>
</ul>
<p>and you&rsquo;re worried</p>
<p>about the private sector&rsquo;s ability to succeed.</p>
<p>But what about something like electric vehicles?</p>
<p>I mean, what role did the public and the private sectors</p>
<p>play there?</p>
<ul>
<li>I think that&rsquo;s a terrific example</li>
</ul>
<p>of how government and businesses can work together,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a general acceptance that each has a role to play</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s something that everybody agrees has to be done.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve been trying,</p>
<p>we now meaning California,</p>
<p>you know, for decades,</p>
<p>to deal with the problem of vehicle pollution.</p>
<p>And we worked on the fuels,</p>
<p>we worked on the engines,</p>
<p>we were, and we adopted regulations</p>
<p>that systematically ratcheted down</p>
<p>on the allowable emissions.</p>
<p>So, before we really got seriously into zero emission</p>
<p>vehicle requirements,</p>
<p>an internal combustion engine</p>
<p>that you could buy in a car in California,</p>
<p>emitted about one 100th of the pollutants</p>
<p>that it would&rsquo;ve admitted</p>
<p>if you had bought that same model from Ford, or GM,</p>
<p>or whoever, you know, in 1970.</p>
<p>So, incredible progress.</p>
<p>Technology rising to meet the demand,</p>
<p>California making the demand,</p>
<p>knowing what technology was capable of doing,</p>
<p>and coming together with a strong regulatory program.</p>
<p>We also, of course, as California,</p>
<p>were a big enough market</p>
<p>so that companies design cars to, you know,</p>
<p>to meet our needs.</p>
<p>Global warming takes you to a whole new level.</p>
<p>I mean, we needed, we in California</p>
<p>need zero emission vehicles for urban air pollution reasons,</p>
<p>and so do places like Shanghai, or Beijing,</p>
<p>or Delhi, or Indonesia, et cetera.</p>
<p>But the, most of the world doesn&rsquo;t really.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s urban needs</p>
<p>that are sort of driving it.</p>
<p>But the world needs vehicles.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna have personal transportation,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re gonna move, and any kind of a global economy,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna move goods around,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve gotta have emission-free transportation essentially.</p>
<p>So, we started to make that leap in California.</p>
<p>And fortunately,</p>
<p>enough of the companies</p>
<p>could see the handwriting on the wall,</p>
<p>especially with Europe jumping in,</p>
<p>in a very aggressive way,</p>
<p>that they rose to meet the challenge.</p>
<p>And so we went from hearing that electric vehicles</p>
<p>were always gonna be a niche market,</p>
<p>and would never be able to be sold at prices that, you know,</p>
<p>real people would possibly be willing to pay,</p>
<p>to a point now where every auto company</p>
<p>is seriously making zero-emission vehicles,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re marketing them.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re still not the majority of what they sell,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re gonna be there pretty soon.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, let me paraphrase that.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s a interesting world,</p>
<p>where if you have a big market like California,</p>
<p>a strong forward-looking regulatory framework</p>
<p>combined with an innovating, exciting,</p>
<p>visionary private sector,</p>
<p>can together, working together, solve this problem.</p>
<p>So, let me ask along those lines,</p>
<p>tell us about your experience in particular</p>
<p>with Volkswagen and Dieselgate as it&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>and then Volkswagen&rsquo;s switch</p>
<p>to supporting California&rsquo;s strict environmental standards.</p>
<p>This was a interesting example</p>
<p>where there wasn&rsquo;t participation,</p>
<p>but a company saw the light.</p>
<p>What lessons would you offer our students</p>
<p>about business and government working together</p>
<p>in both designing, but even more importantly,</p>
<p>implementing environmental regulations?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, well, so this is sort of a good and a bad example,</li>
</ul>
<p>but the lesson that you draw from it to begin with</p>
<p>is that regulations are only as good</p>
<p>as your ability to enforce them.</p>
<p>And in this case, Volkswagen, for a number of years,</p>
<p>and they were not the only company that was doing this,</p>
<p>they just did it in a bigger and more egregious way,</p>
<p>they came up with a way</p>
<p>of evading our emissions requirements for nitrogen oxides,</p>
<p>which are directly related to combustion,</p>
<p>to how much, how much fuel is being combusted,</p>
<p>by finding a way to basically turn off the monitoring system</p>
<p>in the vehicle itself,</p>
<p>under certain driving conditions.</p>
<p>So, it would meet the emissions requirements</p>
<p>when it was on the dynamometer being tested,</p>
<p>to be allowed to be sold,</p>
<p>but wouldn&rsquo;t meet it in the real world.</p>
<p>And we become aware of that. (laughs)</p>
<ul>
<li>[Interviewer] How did you figure it out</li>
</ul>
<p>that there was cheating going on?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, actually, the Europeans,</li>
</ul>
<p>who were very big on diesels,</p>
<p>were the ones who first started to complain</p>
<p>about how they weren&rsquo;t seeing in the real world,</p>
<p>when they went out and measured air quality,</p>
<p>the benefits that they should have seen</p>
<p>from these new clean vehicles</p>
<p>that were out there on the road.</p>
<p>California started testing,</p>
<p>and we did roadside testing also,</p>
<p>and then we actually went and bought cars,</p>
<p>and put them on dynamometers with equipment,</p>
<p>and saw how they were operating during the test,</p>
<p>and figured out what was, what was going on.</p>
<p>This was helped a lot also,</p>
<p>by the fact that a sort of middle-level engineer</p>
<p>who had been working,</p>
<p>he was part of the government affairs team at Volkswagen,</p>
<p>confessed to one of my staff people</p>
<p>what was going on.</p>
<p>Because he saw that we were getting close</p>
<p>to figuring it out,</p>
<p>but he also was so, himself, so ashamed,</p>
<p>of what was happening,</p>
<p>so upset about what was happening,</p>
<p>that he felt like he had to tell somebody what was going on.</p>
<ul>
<li>That&rsquo;s an incredible story. - So, that&rsquo;s how we found out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then of course, this exposed into a huge enforcement action.</p>
<p>We brought it to the federal government.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t because the federal government didn&rsquo;t care,</p>
<p>but we sort of had a agreement with them</p>
<p>based on how we could allocate our resources,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;d start certain areas of enforcement,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d do others,</p>
<p>and we would just share the burden of enforcement</p>
<p>on motor vehicles.</p>
<p>So, this one was ours to begin with,</p>
<p>but then they took it up,</p>
<p>and together we pursued the court actions,</p>
<p>which eventually resulted in a settlement,</p>
<p>which was the largest consent decree ever</p>
<p>for anything related to automotive pollution.</p>
<p>And while that was all going on,</p>
<p>the German government got involved,</p>
<p>the European Union got involved,</p>
<p>there was horrible publicity,</p>
<p>and the company was under investigation</p>
<p>by their own parliament.</p>
<p>You know, Volkswagen,</p>
<p>and in general, the EU regulations</p>
<p>were not as strict as California&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t enforce them as much as the US did.</p>
<p>But in this instance,</p>
<p>they felt like they were being embarrassed.</p>
<p>And the German government,</p>
<p>which has a particularly close relationship,</p>
<p>because of its history with Volkswagen,</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t just turn the other way.</p>
<p>And so they were threatening all kinds of reforms.</p>
<p>Volkswagen ended up throwing out its board of directors,</p>
<p>firing the CEO.</p>
<p>You know, they found that the knowledge of what was going on</p>
<p>went all the way up to the top.</p>
<p>And then at the end of it all,</p>
<p>not only did they pay their fines</p>
<p>and come into compliance,</p>
<p>but they decided to use this</p>
<p>as a way to actually reinvent the company</p>
<p>in a very major way.</p>
<p>And their decision was to, not just to satisfy</p>
<p>California&rsquo;s demand</p>
<p>that they produce electric vehicles,</p>
<p>but to actually commit</p>
<p>to making all of their products electric</p>
<p>before anybody else was doing that,</p>
<p>and to spin off a company,</p>
<p>and this was part of the settlement with us,</p>
<p>a company that would build electric charging stations.</p>
<p>Because obviously, one of the things</p>
<p>that has slowed down the transformation of this industry,</p>
<p>is that you can&rsquo;t just work on the vehicle,</p>
<p>you have to be looking at the fuel at the same time.</p>
<p>And there was a real question</p>
<p>about whether there was gonna be enough charging</p>
<p>for these new vehicles, so.</p>
<ul>
<li>That&rsquo;s an incredible story.</li>
</ul>
<p>I mean, to think that you turned around this company,</p>
<p>from your office where you were,</p>
<p>that that led to this incredible transformation,</p>
<p>is just such an amazing story.</p>
<ul>
<li>I think it&rsquo;s a great story for Volkswagen.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, I mean, the fact that in the end,</p>
<p>in the end, they chose to use this as a positive push</p>
<p>to do something that maybe some people of the company</p>
<p>had been thinking about for a while,</p>
<p>but they would never have been able to do it without that.</p>
<p>It is a good example, I think,</p>
<p>of how you can actually use enforcement</p>
<p>as a way to benefit the private sector as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, as an environmental regulator,</li>
</ul>
<p>you&rsquo;ve often faced extreme lobbying</p>
<p>against environmental regulations by industry and business,</p>
<p>but we know that at other times</p>
<p>some parts of industry have supported,</p>
<p>or even encouraged government efforts to regulate pollution</p>
<p>or emissions of greenhouses gases.</p>
<p>So, when do you see the interaction</p>
<p>between business and regulators</p>
<p>at their most effective and productive?</p>
<p>And do you think that businesses are more receptive now</p>
<p>to policymaking,</p>
<p>than they were when you started your career?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, over the years,</li>
</ul>
<p>I think both sides have evolved.</p>
<p>And certainly, I spent a lot more time</p>
<p>in my last few years at the Air Resources Board</p>
<p>meeting with business representatives,</p>
<p>than I ever did in the early years.</p>
<p>And we were holding the kinds,</p>
<p>I mean we always had informal workshops</p>
<p>where businesses could come in and talk to the regulators,</p>
<p>but they weren&rsquo;t, they were talking mostly</p>
<p>at the technical level.</p>
<p>As time went on,</p>
<p>and you know, and you could see this</p>
<p>as maybe government and business getting too cozy,</p>
<p>and people could be suspicious of it.</p>
<p>But I think both sides came to believe</p>
<p>that we had to understand each other&rsquo;s motives,</p>
<p>and we have to also be able to make suggestions</p>
<p>about ways things could be done better,</p>
<p>which are very hard to really surface effectively,</p>
<p>if you are doing it at a public hearing</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re up on a dais,</p>
<p>and somebody is coming before you</p>
<p>and reading a statement.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just not gonna be able to engage</p>
<p>in some of the best kind of thinking and policy making.</p>
<p>So, I have thought for a long time,</p>
<p>that, you know, the California&rsquo;s success in the early days,</p>
<p>especially in our air quality programs,</p>
<p>is really largely dependent on voluntary goodwill</p>
<p>by companies in California,</p>
<p>which didn&rsquo;t mean that they always agreed with us,</p>
<p>or always liked what we were doing.</p>
<p>But especially in the case of larger companies,</p>
<p>they tend to have,</p>
<p>Volkswagen being an example of why this isn&rsquo;t always true,</p>
<p>but they tend to actually have a strong commitment</p>
<p>to following the law,</p>
<p>once it is the law.</p>
<p>And, so we got a lot more compliance</p>
<p>than we could have gotten</p>
<p>if we actually had tried to, you know,</p>
<p>be out there policing every car</p>
<p>that rolled off the assembly lines.</p>
<p>But with global warming,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re in a different world,</p>
<p>because the problem is so complex,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re back at the stage where every sector</p>
<p>wants to claim that it&rsquo;s somebody else&rsquo;s fault,</p>
<p>or somebody else should be doing more.</p>
<p>And so coming up with a common vision</p>
<p>of what the program should be,</p>
<p>has proven to be pretty elusive.</p>
<p>I mean, over the last decade or more,</p>
<p>there have been groups, coalitions of different companies</p>
<p>that have come together around the idea</p>
<p>that there needs to be some form of a price on carbon,</p>
<p>which absolutely, by the way, has to happen.</p>
<p>I mean, whether it&rsquo;s through a cap-and-trade program,</p>
<p>which is actually more difficult,</p>
<p>or through some sort of tax,</p>
<p>which you can then work through</p>
<p>how you deal with borders and boundaries and all of that.</p>
<p>But if there isn&rsquo;t a way to spread knowledge and acceptance</p>
<p>of the fact that carbon is causing problems</p>
<p>throughout the economy,</p>
<p>we will not make it to anything like the goals that we have,</p>
<p>which may be too hard anyway right now.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s just say, you know,</p>
<p>even if we decide it&rsquo;s gonna be two degrees of warming,</p>
<p>or more than two degrees of warming,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not gonna be 2050, it&rsquo;s gonna be 2060,</p>
<p>whatever it is, we won&rsquo;t get there,</p>
<p>if we can&rsquo;t figure out a way to put a price on carbon.</p>
<p>And industry has actually been, not always,</p>
<p>and not in every sector,</p>
<p>more forthright about saying that</p>
<p>than you, than many in the political world,</p>
<p>or in the, you know, in other forms of advocacy groups.</p>
<ul>
<li>I mean, the, putting a price on carbon</li>
</ul>
<p>has been the goal for, I guess, for decades.</p>
<p>Do you have any idea how to do it,</p>
<p>since nobody&rsquo;s been able to figure it out yet?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, I mean the California Program of Cap and Trade</li>
</ul>
<p>is a way of putting a price on carbon.</p>
<p>It just gives certainty to the allowable amount,</p>
<p>and then companies can trade underneath the cap,</p>
<p>versus the tax where the certainty is around</p>
<p>what the price is,</p>
<p>and people can make their own decisions</p>
<p>based on the price that&rsquo;s allocated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s two sides of the same coin really.</p>
<p>And actually, although it&rsquo;s been very slow, you know,</p>
<p>other, there are other jurisdictions</p>
<p>that have actually implemented cap-and-trade programs</p>
<p>since we did.</p>
<p>Of course, we started with Quebec as our partner,</p>
<p>the province in Canada,</p>
<p>which you know, looks very different from California</p>
<p>in some ways,</p>
<p>but has a very similar kind of environmental ethic.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been joined by other Canadian provinces,</p>
<p>once Canada decided that all of their states,</p>
<p>all of their provinces,</p>
<p>would have to put some kind of a price on carbon.</p>
<p>So, they actually did that at the national level.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, let&rsquo;s get back to the California cap-and-trade model,</li>
</ul>
<p>which as you point out,</p>
<p>is a way of putting a price on carbon.</p>
<p>How in that case</p>
<p>were you able to get business in agreement with you,</p>
<p>to make that model work?</p>
<p>And even though we&rsquo;re just a state</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re the equivalent</p>
<p>of one of the largest countries in the world?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, first of all, you know,</li>
</ul>
<p>the program has been criticized,</p>
<p>because in the beginning,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t auction off the allowances,</p>
<p>we actually allocated them freely</p>
<p>to most of the businesses that were subject to the program.</p>
<p>So, within California,</p>
<p>we started with only the 700 largest emitters.</p>
<p>We added fuels after that.</p>
<p>So, natural gas, and gasoline, and diesel fuel,</p>
<p>came under the Cap-and-Trade Program,</p>
<p>in kind of the second wave.</p>
<p>The first wave was just the companies.</p>
<p>And we came up with a system</p>
<p>in which we allocated allowances by sector,</p>
<p>based on a sort of a average of efficiency</p>
<p>within that sector.</p>
<p>So, the most efficient company,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say among oil refineries,</p>
<p>might get actually all the allowances that they could use,</p>
<p>and the least efficient would not get as many.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, the least efficient was forced to work,</li>
</ul>
<p>to move harder. - Correct, right.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And within each of those sectors, let&rsquo;s say oil and gas,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ultimately there was enough agreement</p>
<p>on the part of the companies</p>
<p>that thought they were gonna come out ahead,</p>
<p>so that they actually embraced the cap versus fighting it.</p>
<p>And they were also afraid,</p>
<p>that being California, if we didn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>if they didn&rsquo;t come along and help design a program</p>
<p>that they could live with,</p>
<p>it would, it could be worse, you know?</p>
<p>We might have banned all oil drilling.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s still people who are, you know,</p>
<p>mad at Jerry Brown,</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause he didn&rsquo;t ban all oil and gas drilling in California,</p>
<p>which he could have done legally.</p>
<p>I mean, he made a decision politically,</p>
<p>that, and it was sort of a moral decision too,</p>
<p>that as long as people in California were using the product,</p>
<p>we shouldn&rsquo;t just pretend</p>
<p>that we weren&rsquo;t gonna produce any of it in California.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ah, interesting.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, let me ask you another question about cap and trade.</p>
<p>So, I guess the idea behind cap and trade</p>
<p>is where the scope for improving efficiency,</p>
<p>and reducing pollution,</p>
<p>is the greatest,</p>
<p>is where you would do that.</p>
<p>But at the same time,</p>
<p>some groups don&rsquo;t like cap and trade,</p>
<p>because companies can buy cheaper emission reductions</p>
<p>outside their own factory gates,</p>
<p>so they can find a way of not actually reducing pollution</p>
<p>in their own premises.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your response to that critique of cap and trade?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, from the very beginning,</li>
</ul>
<p>it seemed to be that it was,</p>
<p>there was some confusion</p>
<p>about what we were trying to accomplish;</p>
<p>that if your goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,</p>
<p>companies that are subject to the program,</p>
<p>are not going to choose</p>
<p>to keep their oldest, least efficient plants going,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to pump up production from their newest,</p>
<p>most efficient plants.</p>
<p>And so the idea that they would be deliberately continuing</p>
<p>to pollute in the low income, most impacted communities</p>
<p>because of this program,</p>
<p>just didn&rsquo;t make logical sense.</p>
<p>But if you think about this</p>
<p>from the perspective of a community group,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s really not primarily concerned about global warming,</p>
<p>their real concern is the emissions from the diesel trucks</p>
<p>that are pulling up to the factory gate,</p>
<p>or the other toxic contaminants</p>
<p>that the factory is emitting,</p>
<p>you can see why they would not want to buy into a program</p>
<p>where those emissions at that site</p>
<p>were not being specifically addressed.</p>
<p>And so this has been a tension from the very beginning.</p>
<p>And one of the things I think it&rsquo;s brought to the fore,</p>
<p>especially with the increasing organizational power</p>
<p>of, you know, environmental justice communities,</p>
<p>is a stronger emphasis on localized pollution controls</p>
<p>at those facilities,</p>
<p>and making sure that the program doesn&rsquo;t do anything</p>
<p>that actually incentivizes</p>
<p>continued operation of the plants</p>
<p>that are the most irritating. - But of course it is,</p>
<p>it is less efficient than-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. - Yes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So, now the Cap-and-Trade Program is not pure anymore.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s less efficient. - Yeah.</p>
<p>Ah, interesting.</p>
<p>So, for everyone here,</p>
<p>if you would give one message</p>
<p>to all our students in our community here,</p>
<p>what would be the one thing that you would tell them to do,</p>
<p>to try to address climate change right now?</p>
<ul>
<li>You know, I don&rsquo;t think there is one thing</li>
</ul>
<p>you can tell people to do.</p>
<p>I think the message is you gotta act with urgency,</p>
<p>wherever you see the opportunity,</p>
<p>but at the same time recognize</p>
<p>that this is a fight</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna be in for the rest of our lives;</p>
<p>the rest of my life and the rest of your lives as well.</p>
<p>And so you need to figure out</p>
<p>how to, to incorporate that kind of thinking and policy,</p>
<p>and recognize that you&rsquo;re gonna have to be a part of it,</p>
<p>no matter what. (laughs)</p>
<p>Nobody gets to escape being part of fighting climate change,</p>
<p>and no one entity can be the ones that solve it all either.</p>
<p>I mean, you could say energy as a thing is like 70%,</p>
<p>emissions from energy as a whole.</p>
<p>But if you try to break that down</p>
<p>into the various components,</p>
<p>it becomes pretty clear that, you know,</p>
<p>just building solar,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not retiring other things,</p>
<p>just switching to electric cars,</p>
<p>just doing a better job with waste,</p>
<p>or you know, stopping meat production,</p>
<p>you, no one of those things in and of itself</p>
<p>is gonna do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna require we all do what we can,</p>
<p>and also that we be more holistic in our thinking, I think.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, that leads me to my next question.</li>
</ul>
<p>California&rsquo;s approach is perhaps less holistic</p>
<p>in the sense that the climate strategy</p>
<p>is to try to electrify as much as possible</p>
<p>from cars to buses to buildings.</p>
<p>On the other hand, our electricity grid in California</p>
<p>is increasingly subject to a lot of stresses,</p>
<p>wildfires, blackouts.</p>
<p>How do we reconcile this push</p>
<p>towards electrifying everything</p>
<p>with the increasing lack of stability</p>
<p>of our electrical grid?</p>
<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;ve known for a long time</li>
</ul>
<p>that we were gonna need to build more generation</p>
<p>in California,</p>
<p>and also that we could do much better</p>
<p>at deploying electricity,</p>
<p>if we had a regional grid with other states,</p>
<p>that was more closely tied</p>
<p>to each state&rsquo;s abilities and needs</p>
<p>to consume and generate at different times of the day.</p>
<p>So, we now, in California,</p>
<p>generate more solar electricity in the middle of the day</p>
<p>than we can use.</p>
<p>We literally dump electricity that could be put to work</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t have enough demand for it.</p>
<p>We have more demand at the end of the day,</p>
<p>late in the day, and early evening hours,</p>
<p>and into the evening,</p>
<p>then we can satisfy with solar.</p>
<p>We have some wind,</p>
<p>and we have some other resources,</p>
<p>but basically, we need to be importing from Wyoming,</p>
<p>and other places in the evening hours.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason why we shouldn&rsquo;t be able to share,</p>
<p>if we could work out the politics</p>
<p>of making a more efficient and equitable system overall.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a lot of room for micro-grid technologies,</p>
<p>where you bring it down to the local level,</p>
<p>and work your timing of things.</p>
<p>We know we can do a lot more with storage,</p>
<p>so that when there is excess electricity,</p>
<p>you can save it in batteries or other ways.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also the possibility,</p>
<p>increasingly now being looked at and used,</p>
<p>where an electric car can be its own storage system,</p>
<p>and be part of a little electric system in its neighborhood</p>
<p>and within its house,</p>
<p>so that when there is access electricity on the grid,</p>
<p>you could be charging your car,</p>
<p>and when there isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>your charge has a, your car has a bidirectional plug,</p>
<p>and you could actually be giving electricity</p>
<p>back to the house.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very simplistic explanation,</p>
<p>but that, but that actually can happen,</p>
<p>and now does happen.</p>
<p>You know, if you, a Ford 150 truck</p>
<p>comes with electric outlets on it.</p>
<p>So, a lot of people who could care less</p>
<p>about being in a zero-emission vehicle,</p>
<p>love the idea that they could be off road in their truck,</p>
<p>and be plugging in all sorts of other cool appliances</p>
<p>out wherever it is they are.</p>
<p>So, you know, this is, this is a way more interesting</p>
<p>and diverse system,</p>
<p>than certainly seemed to be when, you know,</p>
<p>a few years ago</p>
<p>people were just thinking about one power plant</p>
<p>with lines radiating out,</p>
<p>and that was the, what the whole system was.</p>
<p>Still, we&rsquo;re gonna need more.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no way around that.</p>
<p>And we all want more things that are electric.</p>
<p>We do consider, by the way, not just battery electrics,</p>
<p>but fuel-cell vehicles are electric-drive vehicles.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s, there is a place in the economy for us,</p>
<p>and for many parts of the world,</p>
<p>for hydrogen running a fuel cell,</p>
<p>to be a big part of this electric future</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s nothing in the fact that, you know,</p>
<p>on a very, very hot day this year,</p>
<p>we were worried</p>
<p>about whether there were gonna have to be some blackouts.</p>
<p>That tells you nothing about where we&rsquo;re gonna be</p>
<p>in a few years,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re just, we&rsquo;re moving ahead</p>
<p>on all these other fronts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you for that.</li>
</ul>
<p>I mean, one of the things we really emphasize here at Haas</p>
<p>is the power of innovation,</p>
<p>and also we&rsquo;re focusing on sustainability.</p>
<p>And so the intersectionality</p>
<p>of innovating and sustainability</p>
<p>is just so incredibly important.</p>
<p>As a trade economist,</p>
<p>I also like what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>about the opportunity to trade energy</p>
<p>across time zones and locations.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s tremendous potential there.</p>
<p>So, now we&rsquo;re gonna change,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna change the focus a little bit,</p>
<p>and talk about China.</p>
<p>So, China&rsquo;s the largest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>But the China, the California,</p>
<p>further climate action between California and China.</p>
<p>So, that area,</p>
<p>climate change has long been one of the few reliable areas</p>
<p>of productive collaboration between the US and China.</p>
<p>Can you tell us more about the work of that institute?</p>
<p>And how does this current tension that we&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>between the US and China</p>
<p>affect the work of that institute?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, it has been affected</li>
</ul>
<p>to the extent that exchanges of the kind</p>
<p>that we were hoping would occur,</p>
<p>where scholars from one country</p>
<p>would go and spend time in the other,</p>
<p>have been pretty dramatically affected.</p>
<p>But it is interesting that at a time when, you know,</p>
<p>between the US and China at the national level,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably more tension,</p>
<p>and general lack of sense of collaboration</p>
<p>than there has been for many, many years right now.</p>
<p>But the work of the institute</p>
<p>has continued both in China and in California.</p>
<p>We have people working together,</p>
<p>and they can share documents,</p>
<p>and, you know, work together over the internet.</p>
<p>And they are publishing a group of papers,</p>
<p>a set of papers,</p>
<p>that are gonna be coming out quite soon,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in circulating and draft form right now,</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;ll have on 10 sort of big topic areas;</p>
<p>papers that talk about what both China and California,</p>
<p>or really China and the US can do</p>
<p>to meet our goals under the Paris Accord.</p>
<p>And that is an effort which has been,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say sponsored,</p>
<p>but it was, actually, it has been sponsored in a formal way</p>
<p>by the state department,</p>
<p>which had, at Glasgow,</p>
<p>they began a process of revitalizing a China,</p>
<p>I keep saying China California.</p>
<p>The institute is China and California,</p>
<p>but the agreement is between China and the US</p>
<p>to collaborate on developing China solutions.</p>
<p>That really goes back to Obama,</p>
<p>when he had invited the premier of China to come over,</p>
<p>and they spent time together,</p>
<p>and announced a series of things</p>
<p>that they wanted to work on on climate.</p>
<p>The Chinese are very serious about this stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re having political problems of their own</p>
<p>internally as well.</p>
<p>And you know, the effects of COVID have been disastrous</p>
<p>as far as their economy is concerned.</p>
<p>But they continue to just produce renewable energy</p>
<p>at a record rate,</p>
<p>and they have implemented a cap-and-trade program</p>
<p>for electric generation in China.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, no, I&rsquo;m aware of that</li>
</ul>
<p>having done a lot of research on China.</p>
<p>And if you just, if you look at aerial photographs</p>
<p>of Beijing over decades,</p>
<p>before you couldn&rsquo;t see Beijing at all,</p>
<p>and the progress that has been made is really remarkable.</p>
<p>I have one final question before I open it up to the floor.</p>
<p>After I ask my question,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll give us your thoughts on that,</p>
<p>if you want to ask a question,</p>
<p>you can then go to the mic,</p>
<p>and you can identify yourself,</p>
<p>and ask your question.</p>
<p>So, my last question here is what would you recommend</p>
<p>for Haas students,</p>
<p>or for non-Haas students for that matter,</p>
<p>who wanna lead businesses,</p>
<p>and also contribute to sustainability and climate solutions?</p>
<p>So, where should they be looking to make the biggest impact?</p>
<ul>
<li>I really wish that I had a good, simple answer</li>
</ul>
<p>to give to that question.</p>
<p>But one of the things that I think we need to recognize,</p>
<p>is that given the vast amount of change</p>
<p>that has to happen throughout society,</p>
<p>maybe the goal of being a leader,</p>
<p>even though we do need leaders,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t necessarily the most important thing.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re gonna be the leader in something,</p>
<p>you should be a leader</p>
<p>that makes climate a big part of your portfolio,</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re gonna be working on.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t have to be,</p>
<p>your goal doesn&rsquo;t have to be the leader,</p>
<p>if you are serving the purpose</p>
<p>of building a community of people,</p>
<p>or groups that are addressing this issue collectively,</p>
<p>because this is about doing things for the public good</p>
<p>as opposed to only for the good of your own company.</p>
<p>So, in, you know, it&rsquo;s a little bit antithetical</p>
<p>in some ways,</p>
<p>to the desire</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m sure all kinds of people</p>
<p>who come and get degrees here, you know,</p>
<p>have that leadership gene in them,</p>
<p>and they all have the potential to be leaders</p>
<p>wherever they are.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m personally at a point now</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m beginning to think that maybe we need more people</p>
<p>who are doers, (laughs)</p>
<p>wherever they happen to be,</p>
<p>working together to solve problems.</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re seeing the levels of resistance and backlash</p>
<p>to anything that involves asking people to share</p>
<p>in the common good.</p>
<p>So, if you can&rsquo;t do it by mandating people</p>
<p>to do whatever it is you want them to do,</p>
<p>you really have to have people agreeing voluntarily,</p>
<p>that this is what they wanna do.</p>
<p>And it may mean that being a leader means, you know,</p>
<p>being a leader of your PTA, you know,</p>
<p>just to pick an example.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to put down on PTAs.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re actually very powerful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, but we have to agree with each other</p>
<p>that this is something that we, you know,</p>
<p>that we all can agree that we want to do.</p>
<p>And that means talking to other people,</p>
<p>engaging with other people,</p>
<p>which is kind of the opposite of what you think of,</p>
<p>as the, you know, the hard driving CEO personality.</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s interesting because leadership these days</li>
</ul>
<p>is a lot about influence.</p>
<p>And so we had, in a former Dean Speaker Series,</p>
<p>we had general McChrystal</p>
<p>who led the armed forces,</p>
<p>and he talked about how in the military,</p>
<p>even though the military,</p>
<p>we think of it as a hierarchical organization,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all about leadership through influencing people,</p>
<p>inspiring people, educating people.</p>
<p>So, on that note, I would love to hear the first question.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks for speaking with us today.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m Will.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a MBA student here at Berkeley Haas.</p>
<p>My question is, looking forward,</p>
<p>what regulation do you see as being essential,</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t out there today?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Can you translate the question?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Will] Like-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What&rsquo;s the critical new regulation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>that needs to be passed?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Will] Yes, thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a little feedback in my hearing, I think,</p>
<p>but also it is hard for a person</p>
<p>who has to stoop down to speak into the microphone.</p>
<p>So, I appreciate your patience.</p>
<p>So, I think the most critical new regulation</p>
<p>that we need at the national level,</p>
<p>probably builds on what&rsquo;s already</p>
<p>in the Inflation Recovery Act that was out there.</p>
<p>So, you know, we were able to get money,</p>
<p>very large amounts of money passed,</p>
<p>but very little in the way of mandates</p>
<p>as to how it&rsquo;s to be spent.</p>
<p>Probably the most important thing though,</p>
<p>if you sort of took a step back,</p>
<p>would be to what we could get rid of</p>
<p>by way of subsidies for the oil and gas industry.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still way too much in the current system</p>
<p>that is keeping us from making the changes</p>
<p>that we need to make.</p>
<p>So, in addition to my carbon tax idea,</p>
<p>which is not my idea,</p>
<p>but some form of a carbon tax,</p>
<p>I think we probably need to close loopholes,</p>
<p>or close very longstanding special benefits</p>
<p>that are enjoyed.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s no,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s really just no hope to make it to our climate goals</p>
<p>if we can&rsquo;t hasten the departure</p>
<p>of our current system.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cool.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ll buck the trend of needing to lean down.</p>
<p>I have to go up to the mic. (Mary laughs)</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m Chris, and I&rsquo;m a first year MBA student</p>
<p>here as well.</p>
<p>I just recently was working</p>
<p>on the Clean Energy Transportation Group</p>
<p>over at PG&amp;E,</p>
<p>so we dealt a fair amount with Californian regulators.</p>
<p>So, my question to you</p>
<p>is how do you see the sort of like, need for regulation,</p>
<p>and in, with sort of private companies,</p>
<p>versus the like, stifling nature</p>
<p>that sometimes that can have for innovation?</p>
<p>So, for instance, our group,</p>
<p>we wanted to go out and like, install more chargers,</p>
<p>but we were actually limited by our regulators to do that.</p>
<p>And so how do you see</p>
<p>like, the balance of like, checks and balances</p>
<p>put in place for safety and other requirements,</p>
<p>versus like allowing pure innovation to take over?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, I have been a fan of the kind of regulations</li>
</ul>
<p>that we did,</p>
<p>going back into the 1970s,</p>
<p>that forced big improvements</p>
<p>in the internal combustion engine,</p>
<p>where we didn&rsquo;t specify what technologies</p>
<p>the companies had to use,</p>
<p>we specified an emissions level,</p>
<p>and let them decide what was gonna be the way</p>
<p>to get there.</p>
<p>And I still think that performance-based regulation</p>
<p>is preferable to technology-based regulation,</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s plenty of spaces</p>
<p>where that can still be applied.</p>
<p>I do think that there need to be more incentives</p>
<p>for breakthroughs in technology</p>
<p>than there are today.</p>
<p>And we also have to look</p>
<p>at the ways in which systems work together.</p>
<p>So, if we can&rsquo;t ultimately find ways</p>
<p>to reduce the need for people to drive,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll take a whole lot longer</p>
<p>to get to where we need to go</p>
<p>in terms of emissions from that sector.</p>
<p>So, certainly, in this country,</p>
<p>the thing that&rsquo;s been the hardest to tackle</p>
<p>is how to, how to create the ability</p>
<p>to build new housing,</p>
<p>and at the same time, you know,</p>
<p>build it in ways and in places</p>
<p>where people can bike, walk, and otherwise, you know,</p>
<p>lead healthier lives</p>
<p>than if they have to be providing time and space</p>
<p>for their vehicles.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s more of a holistic pattern.</p>
<p>And I think the failures of the regulatory system</p>
<p>tend to be more where one set of regulators</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t looking at what other regulators are doing,</p>
<p>and figuring out how to get them to work together.</p>
<p>One of the things that I thought President Biden did</p>
<p>sort of early on,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t think got a lot of attention,</p>
<p>but was actually one of the hardest things</p>
<p>ever to do in government,</p>
<p>is that he took two cabinet agencies,</p>
<p>the Department of Energy,</p>
<p>and the Department of Transportation,</p>
<p>and he made them start a new program jointly together</p>
<p>around electrification of the transportation system.</p>
<p>So, you know, each one has its own pride,</p>
<p>it has its own ideas about how things should be done,</p>
<p>but when it comes to deployment of electric charging,</p>
<p>they are absolutely joined at the hip,</p>
<p>and one can&rsquo;t move without the other.</p>
<p>That is really policy making at its hardest.</p>
<ul>
<li>Great.</li>
</ul>
<p>My name is Meredith Fowlie.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a professor of economics from RCNR.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the College of National Resources.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for being here.</p>
<p>Quick question about cap and trade.</p>
<p>So, I share your view</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s really an important part</p>
<p>of sort of the large policy landscape.</p>
<p>And California had been leading,</p>
<p>but as you see Canada, and Washington,</p>
<p>and Europe push forward,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s playing a diminished role in the scoping plan.</p>
<p>It has no official future past 2030,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m concerned about.</p>
<p>So, I guess, given that you are such an instrumental part</p>
<p>of the launch of the Cap-and-Trade Program,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if you can comment on the future trajectory,</p>
<p>given sort of where things seem to be going,</p>
<p>and then where they could be going</p>
<p>with some sort of policy leadership.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, you know, the, you reach a point</li>
</ul>
<p>where you have to sort of decide</p>
<p>if the price of the allowances has gotten to a point</p>
<p>where that in and of itself</p>
<p>is gonna cause a political backlash.</p>
<p>And because there&rsquo;s such a narrow set of people</p>
<p>who actually are subject to the requirements,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not there yet.</p>
<p>But you could easily foresee that after 2030,</p>
<p>you could be at that point</p>
<p>in which case you&rsquo;d be looking for a better way</p>
<p>to spread the costs,</p>
<p>than just through the carbon allowances.</p>
<p>I mean, California&rsquo;s program, I think, is unique</p>
<p>in the way that it blends direct regulation</p>
<p>with a cap and trade program.</p>
<p>And the cap is the key thing,</p>
<p>not not the price on carbon.</p>
<p>But when you start to really lower the cap dramatically,</p>
<p>then the price of carbon obviously does have to go up,</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause there just aren&rsquo;t enough allowances around</p>
<p>for the people who need them.</p>
<p>Then you have to decide whether there&rsquo;s some other technique</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna come along,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be more effective</p>
<p>at allowing for things like cement</p>
<p>to continue to be produced,</p>
<p>or you have to decide</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna produce cement anymore.</p>
<p>And so I think they&rsquo;re looking in a pretty scalpel-like way</p>
<p>at where you can do more with regulation,</p>
<p>and where you can do more with the cap and trade system,</p>
<p>and not ready to really come down one way or the other.</p>
<p>Meantime, if I&rsquo;m right</p>
<p>that the United States, at some point,</p>
<p>is gonna have to kind of find a way</p>
<p>to work its way towards a carbon tax,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re gonna have to figure out how to layer that</p>
<p>on top of the existing Cap-and-Trade Program.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I believed at the time we started the program</p>
<p>that there was going to be a federal program,</p>
<p>and that we would eventually have to negotiate</p>
<p>where our system could be folded into a federal system.</p>
<p>I still think that that&rsquo;s the most desirable goal.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we should be aiming towards a system</p>
<p>where every state has its own.</p>
<p>You know, if Oregon and Washington</p>
<p>are able to develop their programs</p>
<p>in a way that allows for meaningful linkage, real linkage,</p>
<p>between the three,</p>
<p>then it might become more possible.</p>
<p>But, you know, we&rsquo;re not the, even as the Pacific West,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still not a big enough market</p>
<p>to really, I think, keep things moving</p>
<p>as far as we need for them to go.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I think we have time for one last question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, my name is Arno;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>a first-year MBA student.</p>
<p>So, up to now,</p>
<p>much of the focus has been on carbon dioxide,</p>
<p>very little on methane,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s a much more powerful greenhouse gas.</p>
<p>What regulations and policies</p>
<p>do you think states and countries should take</p>
<p>to cut these methane emissions?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What policies should-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What to do about regulating methane?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah, no, I, okay.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, (laughs)</p>
<p>another big question.</p>
<p>I have been involved and still am involved</p>
<p>with a public private partnership,</p>
<p>which is looking at ways</p>
<p>to improve our methane monitoring using satellites.</p>
<p>So, I think that we need to do a better job</p>
<p>of pinpointing where the largest targets of opportunity are,</p>
<p>not just to, not just to enforce existing regulations,</p>
<p>but to develop better new regulations as well.</p>
<p>The focus has mostly been on oil and gas,</p>
<p>where certainly, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a number of hot spots</p>
<p>where you should just focus in</p>
<p>on what&rsquo;s leaking in those places,</p>
<p>and probably through a combination</p>
<p>just of information,</p>
<p>as well as developing some form of regulatory system,</p>
<p>target those.</p>
<p>But the other big sources are the landfills,</p>
<p>which are also very large sources,</p>
<p>and need a different type of regulation,</p>
<p>which hasn&rsquo;t been really worked on for a long time.</p>
<p>And then agricultural production,</p>
<p>especially animal, animal raising.</p>
<p>And there are separate strategies</p>
<p>that are sort of being looked at for each of them.</p>
<p>But again, I feel like it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>that we try to pick out where the places are</p>
<p>that are the biggest sources,</p>
<p>and work directly on those,</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t have time to develop a set of regulations</p>
<p>that are gonna work for everybody.</p>
<p>So, if we can come up with better technologies</p>
<p>in some cases, alternatives to the product completely,</p>
<p>and then, and then work on the regulatory side,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s where we have our greatest opportunities.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, I want everyone to help me</li>
</ul>
<p>in acknowledging and thanking Mary Nichols;</p>
<p>a pioneer in the clearing air movement,</p>
<p>continuing to make a huge difference every day.</p>
<p>Thank you so much</p>
<p>for joining us today. - Thank you.</p>
<p>(audience applauding) Thank you.</p>
<p>Everybody is gonna be a clean air warrior here.</p>
<p>(interviewer laughs)</p>
<p>This entire group.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Interviewer] I think we have a lot of warriors.</li>
