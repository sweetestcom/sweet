    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Dr. Andy Galpin.</p>
<p>Dr. Galpin is a full and tenured professor</p>
<p>in the Department of Kinesiology</p>
<p>at California State University in Fullerton.</p>
<p>He is also a world expert</p>
<p>in all things exercise science and kinesiology.</p>
<p>Today, you are going to hear</p>
<p>what is essentially a masterclass in how to build fitness,</p>
<p>no matter what level of fitness you happen to have.</p>
<p>He talks about how to build endurance</p>
<p>and the multiple types of endurance.</p>
<p>He talks about how to build strength and hypertrophy,</p>
<p>which is the growth of muscle fibers.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re seeking to get stronger</p>
<p>or build bigger muscles or build endurance,</p>
<p>or all of those things, today, you&rsquo;re going to learn how.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also going to learn how to build flexibility,</p>
<p>how to hydrate properly for exercise,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll also talk about nutrition and supplementation.</p>
<p>What makes Dr. Galpin so unique</p>
<p>is his ability to span all levels of exercise science.</p>
<p>He has the ability to clearly communicate</p>
<p>the sets and repetition schemes</p>
<p>that one would want to follow,</p>
<p>for instance, to build more strength</p>
<p>or to build larger muscles.</p>
<p>He also clearly describes exactly how to train</p>
<p>if you want to build more endurance</p>
<p>or enhance cardiovascular function.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s highly unique about Dr. Galpin</p>
<p>and the information he teaches</p>
<p>and the way he communicates that information</p>
<p>is that he can take specific recommendations</p>
<p>of how recreational exercisers</p>
<p>or even professional athletes</p>
<p>ought to train for their specific goals</p>
<p>and link that to specific mechanisms,</p>
<p>that is, the specific changes that need to occur</p>
<p>in the nervous system and in muscle fibers,</p>
<p>and indeed, right down to the genetics of individual cells</p>
<p>in your brain and body</p>
<p>in order for those exercise adaptations to occur.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s truly rare to find somebody</p>
<p>that can span so many different levels of analyses</p>
<p>and who is able to communicate</p>
<p>all those levels of understanding</p>
<p>in such a clear and actionable way.</p>
<p>Indeed, Dr. Galpin is one of just a handful of people</p>
<p>to which I and many others look</p>
<p>when they want to make sure that the information</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re getting about exercise</p>
<p>is gleaned from quality peer-reviewed studies,</p>
<p>hands-on experience with a wide variety of research subjects,</p>
<p>meaning everyday people,</p>
<p>all the way up to professional athletes</p>
<p>in a wide variety of sports.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s no surprise that he&rsquo;s not only</p>
<p>one of the most knowledgeable,</p>
<p>but also the most trusted voices in exercise science.</p>
<p>Dr. Galpin is also an avid communicator</p>
<p>of zero-cost-to-consumer information about exercise science.</p>
<p>You can find him on Instagram at Dr. Andy Galpin</p>
<p>and also on Twitter at Dr. Andy Galpin.</p>
<p>Both places, he provides terrific information</p>
<p>about recent studies, both from his laboratory</p>
<p>and from other laboratories,</p>
<p>more in-depth protocols of the sort</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll hear about today.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re not already following him,</p>
<p>be sure to do so.</p>
<p>He provides only the best information.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s extremely nuanced and precise</p>
<p>and clear in delivering that information.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certain that by the end of today&rsquo;s conversation,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll come away with a tremendous amount of new knowledge</p>
<p>that you can devote to your exercise pursuits.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero-cost-to-consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need, and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs,</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything</p>
<p>you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low, we simply can&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>as well as we would otherwise, our mood is off,</p>
<p>hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength,</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure that you&rsquo;re staying</p>
<p>on top of your hydration and that you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now for my discussion with Dr. Andy Galpin.</p>
<p>Welcome, Dr. Professor Andy Galpin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a long time coming.</p>
<p>We have friends in common,</p>
<p>but this is actually the first time</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve sat down face-to-face.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m very excited.</p>
<p>Yeah, there are only a handful,</p>
<p>meaning about three or four people</p>
<p>who I trust enough in the exercise physiology space</p>
<p>that when they speak, I not only listen,</p>
<p>but I modify my protocols,</p>
<p>and you are among those three or four people.</p>
<p>So first of all, a debt of gratitude.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve greatly shaped the protocols that I use,</p>
<p>and I know there&rsquo;s far more for me and for others to learn.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a professor, you teach in university,</p>
<p>and you have a tremendous range of levels of exploration,</p>
<p>muscle biopsy, literally images down the microscope,</p>
<p>all the way to training professional athletes</p>
<p>and everything in between.</p>
<p>So you are truly an N of one.</p>
<p>And just to start us off,</p>
<p>I would love to have you share with us</p>
<p>what you think most everybody,</p>
<p>or even everybody should know</p>
<p>about principles of strength training,</p>
<p>principles of endurance training,</p>
<p>and principles of, let&rsquo;s call it hypertrophy power</p>
<p>and the other sort of categories of training.</p>
<p>And this could be very top contour,</p>
<p>but what do you think everybody on planet Earth</p>
<p>should know about these categories</p>
<p>of personal and athletic development?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a great first question.</p>
<p>Holy cow, I think I&rsquo;ll start it this way.</p>
<p>I tend to think about,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s about nine different adaptations</p>
<p>you can get from exercise.</p>
<p>Fat loss is not one of those.</p>
<p>It is a by-product,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not really what I&rsquo;m getting at.</p>
<p>And so we can kind of categorize everything like that.</p>
<p>And what we can talk about</p>
<p>are what are the concepts that you need to hit</p>
<p>within each one.</p>
<p>And then you could have infinite discussion</p>
<p>of the different methodologies, right?</p>
<p>And so that first thing to hit is</p>
<p>the concepts are actually fairly few,</p>
<p>but the methods are many, right?</p>
<p>People have said that in iterations throughout time.</p>
<p>So if you walk from the very beginning,</p>
<p>the first one to think about is what we&rsquo;ll just call skill.</p>
<p>So this is improving anything from say a golf swing</p>
<p>to a squatting technique to running.</p>
<p>And this is just simply moving mechanically</p>
<p>how you want your body to move.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna globally call that skill.</p>
<p>From there, we&rsquo;re gonna get into speed.</p>
<p>So this is moving as fast as possible.</p>
<p>The next one is power.</p>
<p>And power is a function of speed,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also a function of the next one, which is strength.</p>
<p>So if you actually multiply strength by speed,</p>
<p>you get power.</p>
<p>And the reason I&rsquo;m making this distinction, by the way,</p>
<p>is some of these are very close</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going in a specific order on purpose here.</p>
<p>For example, power is, like I just said,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a function of speed and strength.</p>
<p>So if you improve speed, you&rsquo;ve also likely improved power,</p>
<p>but not necessarily, right?</p>
<p>Because it could have come from the force direction either.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s carryover.</p>
<p>So like a lot of things that you would do</p>
<p>for the development of strength and power,</p>
<p>they are somewhat similar, but then there&rsquo;s differences,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>So things that you would do correctly for power</p>
<p>would really not develop much strength and vice versa.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna get into all these details later.</p>
<p>Once you get past strength,</p>
<p>and the next one kind of down the list is hypertrophy.</p>
<p>This is muscle size, right?</p>
<p>Growing muscle mass is one way to think about it.</p>
<p>After hypertrophy, you get into these categories of,</p>
<p>the next one is,</p>
<p>these are all globally endurance-based issues.</p>
<p>And the very first one is called muscular endurance.</p>
<p>So this is your ability to do,</p>
<p>how many pushups can you do in one minute?</p>
<p>You know, things like that.</p>
<p>Past muscular endurance,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re now into more of an energetic</p>
<p>or even cardiovascular fatigue.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve left the local muscle</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re now into the entire physiological system</p>
<p>and its ability to produce and sustain work.</p>
<p>And we can get into a bunch of differentiations</p>
<p>within endurance,</p>
<p>but just to keep it really simple right now,</p>
<p>the very first one, think about this as,</p>
<p>I call this anaerobic power, right?</p>
<p>So this is your ability to produce a lot of work</p>
<p>for say 30 seconds to maybe one minute,</p>
<p>kind of two minutes like that.</p>
<p>The next one down then is more closely aligned</p>
<p>to what we&rsquo;ll call your VO2 max.</p>
<p>So this is your ability to kind of do the same thing,</p>
<p>but more of a time domain of say three to 12 minutes.</p>
<p>So this is gonna be a maximum heart rate,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s gonna be well past just max heart rate.</p>
<p>Then after that, we have what I call</p>
<p>long duration endurance.</p>
<p>So this is your ability to sustain work.</p>
<p>The time domain doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>in terms of how fast you&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how long can you sustain work?</p>
<p>This is 30 plus minutes of no break like that.</p>
<p>So as just a high level overview,</p>
<p>those are the different things you can target.</p>
<p>And again, some of those crossover</p>
<p>and some are actually a little bit</p>
<p>contrarian to the other ones.</p>
<p>So pushing towards one is maybe gonna sacrifice</p>
<p>something else.</p>
<p>So as an overall start,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really what we&rsquo;re looking at.</p>
<p>Within all of those though,</p>
<p>they do have similar concepts</p>
<p>in terms of there&rsquo;s a handful of things</p>
<p>you have got to do to make all of those things work.</p>
<p>And we could talk about as many of those as you want,</p>
<p>but one of them is functionally called</p>
<p>progressive overload.</p>
<p>So whichever one you&rsquo;re trying to improve at,</p>
<p>if you want to continue to improve,</p>
<p>you have to have some method of overload.</p>
<p>And as you well know, you&rsquo;ve talked about a lot,</p>
<p>adaptation physiologically happens</p>
<p>as a byproduct of stress.</p>
<p>So you have to push a system.</p>
<p>So if you continue to do say the exact same workout</p>
<p>over time, you better not expect much improvement.</p>
<p>You can keep maintenance,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not going to be adding additional stress.</p>
<p>So in general, you have to have some sort</p>
<p>of progressive overload.</p>
<p>And we can talk in detail about what that means</p>
<p>for each category,</p>
<p>but this could come from adding more weights.</p>
<p>This could come from adding more repetitions.</p>
<p>It could come from doing it more often in the week.</p>
<p>It could come from adding complexity to the movement.</p>
<p>So going from say a partial range of motion</p>
<p>to a full range of motion or adding other variables.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of different ways to progress,</p>
<p>but you have to have some sort of movement forward.</p>
<p>So if you have this kind of routine where you&rsquo;ve built</p>
<p>Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday or something,</p>
<p>and you just do that infinitely,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to get very far.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, I guess, the most high level overview</p>
<p>of all the things people can go after.</p>
<p>And then we can go from whatever direction you want</p>
<p>from there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to do the deep dive on each one of these</p>
<p>for several hours.</p>
<p>But, and I imagine that over time, we probably will.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to chat about a couple of these</p>
<p>in a bit more depth.</p>
<p>So in terms of defining what the progressive overload</p>
<p>variables are for these different categories,</p>
<p>maybe we could hit the two most common combinations</p>
<p>of these nine things.</p>
<p>The first one being strength and hypertrophy,</p>
<p>and maybe we could lump power in there.</p>
<p>Maybe not, you&rsquo;re the exercise physiologist,</p>
<p>but strength and hypertrophy,</p>
<p>which at least bear some relationship.</p>
<p>And then maybe separately, we could explore</p>
<p>sustained work endurance, this 30 minutes</p>
<p>or longer continuously, because I think many people</p>
<p>train in that regime.</p>
<p>And probably something like VO2 max anaerobic as well,</p>
<p>because I know that a number of people now incorporate</p>
<p>so-called HIT or high intensity interval training,</p>
<p>I think with the hopes of either shortening their workouts</p>
<p>and or gaining some additional cardiovascular benefit.</p>
<p>So if we could start with strength and hypertrophy,</p>
<p>I know many people want to be stronger.</p>
<p>They want to grow larger muscles</p>
<p>or at least maintain what they have.</p>
<p>So what are the progressive overload principles</p>
<p>that are most effective over time</p>
<p>for strength and hypertrophy?</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, so I&rsquo;ll actually go a little step back.</p>
<p>With every one of those categories I talked about,</p>
<p>you have what we call your modifiable variables.</p>
<p>So this is a very short list of all the things</p>
<p>you can modify, the different variables within your workout</p>
<p>that can be modified that will change the outcome.</p>
<p>Fancy way of saying, if you do this differently,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re going to get a different result.</p>
<p>So modifiable variables,</p>
<p>the very first one of those is called choice.</p>
<p>So this is the exercise choice that you select.</p>
<p>Now, one of, I&rsquo;m going to go double back here.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m kind of doing a little bit of inception.</p>
<p>So follow me here as I&rsquo;m going up a layer</p>
<p>to come down a couple layers.</p>
<p>I have these fundamental laws of strength and conditioning</p>
<p>that are kind of like a little bit of a joke,</p>
<p>but progressive overload is one of those laws.</p>
<p>Another one of those laws is your exercises themselves</p>
<p>do not determine adaptations.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what I mean.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like, I want to get stronger,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t select an exercise.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t determine you getting strong.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t do the exercise correctly,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not even referring to the technique,</p>
<p>that of course matters,</p>
<p>but if you don&rsquo;t execute it in the right fashion,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re not going to get that adaptation.</p>
<p>So if you choose, I want to get stronger,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do a bench press.</p>
<p>Well, if you do the wrong set range,</p>
<p>the wrong repetition range, the wrong speed,</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t get strength.</p>
<p>You maybe get muscular endurance</p>
<p>and very little strength adaptation.</p>
<p>So the exercise selection itself is important,</p>
<p>but it does not determine the outcome adaptation.</p>
<p>So the very first thing that you need to think about</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re like, I want to get stronger or add muscle,</p>
<p>is not the exercise choice, right?</p>
<p>It is the application of the exercise.</p>
<p>What are the sets?</p>
<p>What are the reps?</p>
<p>What are the rest ranges that you&rsquo;re using?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be your primary determinant.</p>
<p>Now, some exercises are certainly better</p>
<p>for some adaptations.</p>
<p>For example, a deadlift is probably not a great exercise</p>
<p>to do for long duration endurance.</p>
<p>You could theoretically do 30 straight minutes</p>
<p>of deadlifting, but it&rsquo;s probably not our best choice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably a pretty good choice for strength development</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re going to do a low repetition, high set range.</p>
<p>You could theoretically do bicep curls for power,</p>
<p>but probably not your best choice.</p>
<p>Single joint isolation movement</p>
<p>is not the best for developing power.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve ever done a bicep curl as fast as you possibly can?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not going to go well.</p>
<p>So in theory, any exercise can produce any adaptation</p>
<p>given the execution is performed properly.</p>
<p>So now that we&rsquo;ve understood that a little bit,</p>
<p>the exercise itself does not determine the adaptation.</p>
<p>Coming within each one of these categories,</p>
<p>exercise choice is an important variable</p>
<p>because it does lend you to things</p>
<p>like what movement pattern you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>So in other words, if you want to get stronger</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re thinking, okay, what exercise do I do?</p>
<p>You need to think a little bit about</p>
<p>what muscle groups do I want to use?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to be leading you</p>
<p>towards the exercise choice.</p>
<p>For example, I want to use my quads more.</p>
<p>Okay, fine.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re going to choose more of a front squat</p>
<p>type of variation, a goblet squat,</p>
<p>so the bar, the load is in front of you.</p>
<p>If you want to emphasize maybe more</p>
<p>of your hamstrings and glutes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to maybe put a barbell on your back</p>
<p>or do a different one.</p>
<p>So the exercise choice is important to the prescription</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to determine a lot of your success.</p>
<p>Okay, another kind of simpler way to think about this.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a beginner or moderate to intermediate</p>
<p>or maybe you don&rsquo;t have a coach,</p>
<p>you probably want to hedge towards an exercise selection</p>
<p>that is a little bit easier technically.</p>
<p>So you maybe don&rsquo;t want to do a barbell back squat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a pretty complicated movement.</p>
<p>Maybe you want to do a little bit more of,</p>
<p>again, a goblet squat or even use some machines</p>
<p>or a split squat, something that&rsquo;s a little bit simpler</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have a coach,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not a professional athlete.</p>
<p>The likelihood of success is higher</p>
<p>and the risk has now gone lower.</p>
<p>So the very first variable within all of these</p>
<p>is the exercise choice.</p>
<p>The second one is the intensity.</p>
<p>And that refers to, in this context, not perceived effort.</p>
<p>Like, wow, that was a really intense workout.</p>
<p>It is quite literally either a percentage</p>
<p>of your one rep at max</p>
<p>or a percentage of your maximum heart rate or VO2 max.</p>
<p>So for the strength-based things,</p>
<p>you want to think about what&rsquo;s the percentage</p>
<p>of the maximum weight I could lift one time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to call one rep max.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s a percentage of my heart rate, right?</p>
<p>So if I tell you to get on a bike</p>
<p>and I want you to do intervals and I want you at 75%,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m typically referring to 75% of your max heart rate</p>
<p>or VO2 max or something like that.</p>
<p>If I tell you to do squats at 75%,</p>
<p>that means 75% of the maximum amount of weight</p>
<p>you could lift one time or close.</p>
<p>In terms of determining one rep max,</p>
<p>I confess I&rsquo;ve never actually taken the one rep max</p>
<p>for any exercise,</p>
<p>but I have some internal sense of what that might be</p>
<p>or what range it might be.</p>
<p>Is it necessary for people to assess</p>
<p>their one repetition maximum</p>
<p>before going into these sorts of programs?</p>
<p>No, not at all.</p>
<p>I think a more intuitive way is to take a repetition range.</p>
<p>Well, you can do this a couple of different ways.</p>
<p>So there are equations you can run</p>
<p>and you can just Google these anywhere</p>
<p>and these are called conversion charts.</p>
<p>And so it says, okay,</p>
<p>if I did 75 pounds on my bench press</p>
<p>and I did it eight times,</p>
<p>you can just run an estimate and say,</p>
<p>okay, you&rsquo;re probably going to be able to bench</p>
<p>about 95 pounds for one rep max or something.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a very easy conversion chart.</p>
<p>So just pick a load that you feel comfortable with,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of heavy, but not like crazy heavy</p>
<p>and do as many repetitions as you can</p>
<p>with a really good technique.</p>
<p>And then look what that number would be.</p>
<p>So conversion-</p>
<p>Probably safer than doing one repetition maximum.</p>
<p>For the general public who has, again, no coaching,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s safer.</p>
<p>For a professional athlete, it&rsquo;s not any safer,</p>
<p>or not even a professional athlete,</p>
<p>but a trained person with a coach.</p>
<p>But for most people, yeah,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good way to go about it.</p>
<p>You can also just kind of do it with feel</p>
<p>in the sense that,</p>
<p>say you want to do a set of five repetitions</p>
<p>and you do the load and you think,</p>
<p>I could have done one or two more.</p>
<p>And then you kind of have an idea</p>
<p>of what that number is going to be.</p>
<p>If you think, man, that last one,</p>
<p>I had to kind of really, really, really get after it,</p>
<p>then maybe just call that that number, right?</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t have to get overly concerned.</p>
<p>In fact, when we start getting into these number ranges,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to see that they&rsquo;re all ranges.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to give a specific 95%</p>
<p>for one of these exact reasons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that precise for most of them.</p>
<p>In fact, some of them like hypertrophy have enormous ranges</p>
<p>that you like almost can&rsquo;t miss.</p>
<p>So the intensity in that case doesn&rsquo;t even matter</p>
<p>for the most part,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s not the primary determinant.</p>
<p>Some of these you&rsquo;re going to see intensity as a determinant</p>
<p>and some of these you&rsquo;re going to see volume</p>
<p>is the true determinant.</p>
<p>So intensity though is a second one.</p>
<p>Choice was the very first manipulatable variable.</p>
<p>Intensity was the second one.</p>
<p>The third one is what we call volume.</p>
<p>And so this is just how many reps</p>
<p>and how many sets are you doing, right?</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re going to do three sets of 10,</p>
<p>that volume would be 30, right?</p>
<p>Five sets of five, that volume is 25.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a simple equation.</p>
<p>How much work are you totally doing?</p>
<p>The next one past that is called rest intervals.</p>
<p>So this is the amount of time you&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>in between typically a set.</p>
<p>Then from there you have progression,</p>
<p>which is what we started to talk about,</p>
<p>this progressive overload.</p>
<p>Are you increasing by weight or reps</p>
<p>or rest intervals or complexity or whatever?</p>
<p>So all of those things can be changed</p>
<p>as a method of progression.</p>
<p>And so maybe you want to go progressing</p>
<p>from a single joint exercise,</p>
<p>like a leg extension on a machine,</p>
<p>and you want to progress by moving</p>
<p>to a whole body movement like a squat.</p>
<p>That in and of itself,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to change the load</p>
<p>or the reps or the rest.</p>
<p>That is a representation of progressive overload.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably a pretty good place to start</p>
<p>because number one, especially for beginners,</p>
<p>is to make sure that the movement pattern is correct.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about intensity.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about rep ranges or any of these things.</p>
<p>You need to learn to move correctly,</p>
<p>and you need to give your body some time</p>
<p>to develop some tissue tolerance</p>
<p>so that you&rsquo;re not getting overtly sore.</p>
<p>In general, soreness is a terrible proxy</p>
<p>for exercise quality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really bad way to estimate</p>
<p>whether it was a good or a bad workout,</p>
<p>especially for people in that beginner to middle</p>
<p>to moderate.</p>
<p>In fact, even for our professional athletes,</p>
<p>we do not use soreness as a metric of a good workout.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really bad idea for a bunch of reasons.</p>
<p>On the same token,</p>
<p>because stress is required for adaptation,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to leave at the gym</p>
<p>and feel like, I don&rsquo;t really do much.</p>
<p>There has to be there.</p>
<p>So if you think about soreness on a scale of one to 10,</p>
<p>you probably want to spend most of your time</p>
<p>in like the three.</p>
<p>You mean post-exercise?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In between workouts?</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>And I know we&rsquo;ll talk about recovery extensively later,</p>
<p>but if one body part or set of body parts is sore,</p>
<p>is that an indication that one should stay out of training?</p>
<p>I would imagine the answer is no in most cases.</p>
<p>And secondarily to that,</p>
<p>if a particular muscle is sore,</p>
<p>does that mean that muscle is not ready to be trained again?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The answer to both of those is the same,</p>
<p>which is no, right?</p>
<p>You can certainly train a sore muscle.</p>
<p>You need to, I guess,</p>
<p>have a little bit of feel on that, right?</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re sore of like,</p>
<p>okay, and you&rsquo;re moving around a little bit</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, man, this is a little bit sore,</p>
<p>you can train.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like, I can&rsquo;t sit on the couch without crying</p>
<p>because my glutes are so sore,</p>
<p>like we probably don&rsquo;t need to train again, right?</p>
<p>Does whimpering count as crying?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In that particular case, I&rsquo;d say,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve actually gone to a place of detriment</p>
<p>because now you&rsquo;re gonna have to skip a training session</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;re behind.</p>
<p>So your actual total volume, say across the month,</p>
<p>is actually gonna be lower</p>
<p>because you went way too hard in those workouts,</p>
<p>had to take too many days off in between.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna see that you&rsquo;re gonna cover less distance</p>
<p>over the course of a month or six months or even a year.</p>
<p>So you wanna walk a pretty fine line.</p>
<p>And for most people, I would say hedge a little bit</p>
<p>on the side of less sore than more sore</p>
<p>because frequency is very, very important</p>
<p>for almost all these adaptations.</p>
<p>The training frequency.</p>
<p>Which is the last modifiable variable, right?</p>
<p>Frequency, which is how many times per week</p>
<p>are you doing that thing?</p>
<p>So those are kind of our global things</p>
<p>that we can play with.</p>
<p>So when I&rsquo;m trying to manipulate</p>
<p>and you can get strength versus hypertrophy,</p>
<p>or you know what, I want like a little bit of both,</p>
<p>all those variables are the things</p>
<p>that are going through my mind.</p>
<p>Which one do I need to move in which direction</p>
<p>so that I can get this outcome</p>
<p>and not this outcome over here?</p>
<p>For example, some folks might wanna get stronger,</p>
<p>but not put muscle mass on.</p>
<p>Some folks are just kind of want both.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a lot of the general public.</p>
<p>I wanna get a little stronger</p>
<p>and a little bit more muscle, great.</p>
<p>But there are instances where people</p>
<p>for performance reasons</p>
<p>or for purely personal preference,</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t wanna get any more muscle, great,</p>
<p>but I wanna get stronger.</p>
<p>Awesome, if you manipulate those variables correctly,</p>
<p>you can get exactly that.</p>
<p>Very little development of muscle size</p>
<p>and a lot of development and strength.</p>
<p>And this is why we continue to break world records</p>
<p>in sports like powerlifting and weightlifting</p>
<p>that have weight classes.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a top number that we can hit</p>
<p>in terms of body size,</p>
<p>but yet we continue to get stronger and faster.</p>
<p>So this is very possible if you understand</p>
<p>how to manipulate all those variables.</p>
<p>So that being said, we can start off with,</p>
<p>you wanted to go strength and-</p>
<p>Yeah, strength.</p>
<p>And I love that you mentioned the fact</p>
<p>that it is possible to increase strength</p>
<p>without increasing muscle size,</p>
<p>at least not dramatically,</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s not just weight class athletes.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people who for aesthetic reasons,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d like to be stronger.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re hearing that having strong bones</p>
<p>and strong muscles and tendons,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s great for longevity and for avoiding injury</p>
<p>and so many other features of life.</p>
<p>And yet they don&rsquo;t want to fill out</p>
<p>progressively larger and larger sizes of clothing.</p>
<p>And we can go harder to the mechanisms</p>
<p>on that piece if you want.</p>
<p>And we can save that and come back to it.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;d love to, both,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;d love to know,</p>
<p>in other words, if we could define</p>
<p>some of these modifiable variables</p>
<p>in the context of strength.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say I were somebody who,</p>
<p>I come to you and I say,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s just say for sake of balance here,</p>
<p>because she actually does do some weight training,</p>
<p>I bring my sister in and I say,</p>
<p>me and my sister both want to get stronger.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>What modifiable variable should,</p>
<p>how should we modify the variables?</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>All right, great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do inception on you one more time.</p>
<p>So one of my other laws,</p>
<p>this won&rsquo;t be fast, I promise,</p>
<p>of strength and conditioning is in general,</p>
<p>the default is all joints through all range of motion.</p>
<p>So this is important because it&rsquo;s going to answer</p>
<p>your very first question on this strength category.</p>
<p>So in general,</p>
<p>the ankle should go through the full range of motion</p>
<p>and the knee should go through the full range of motion,</p>
<p>the knee, the hip, the elbow, et cetera, et cetera, right?</p>
<p>Across the workout, not in a single movement.</p>
<p>Well, right.</p>
<p>I would hope.</p>
<p>Unless there&rsquo;s an amazing exercise I haven&rsquo;t heard about.</p>
<p>Well, there are some exercises</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to call more full body.</p>
<p>Think about a full snatch.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re going to take a lot of your muscles,</p>
<p>a lot of your joints through a lot of the range of motions.</p>
<p>Other ones like in isolation,</p>
<p>we call these single joint exercises.</p>
<p>So imagine a bicep curl.</p>
<p>You have one joint in that particular case,</p>
<p>the elbow moving, the shoulder and everything else</p>
<p>is pretty much stable.</p>
<p>And this is how we&rsquo;ll differentiate multi-joint</p>
<p>from single joint movements.</p>
<p>But yeah, so across,</p>
<p>I would even say it doesn&rsquo;t even have to be the day,</p>
<p>but maybe throughout the week.</p>
<p>Try to get every joint through full range of motion.</p>
<p>Now, a couple of quick caveats to that.</p>
<p>I am not advocating using full range of motion</p>
<p>and allowing really bad exercise technique.</p>
<p>So when I say full range of motion, that&rsquo;s the default.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean every single person</p>
<p>can do that for every single exercise.</p>
<p>It means that&rsquo;s where we should be striving to.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s our starting point.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to see a lot less injury</p>
<p>and a lot more productivity out of your training sessions.</p>
<p>In fact, the science is fairly clear on this one.</p>
<p>Strength development as well as hypertrophy</p>
<p>is generally enhanced</p>
<p>with a larger range of motion of training.</p>
<p>And the mechanisms are like somewhat understood on that.</p>
<p>So that being said,</p>
<p>if you have to get into say a bad position</p>
<p>with your say low back, the spine is a very good one.</p>
<p>In general, the spine should say it&rsquo;s very neutral</p>
<p>is what we call it.</p>
<p>So no flexion, no extension, especially in the lumbar region.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re doing say a deadlift</p>
<p>and in order to take your knee</p>
<p>through a full range of motion, a deadlift,</p>
<p>you have to compromise your back position.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s no bueno.</p>
<p>So caveats there aside, don&rsquo;t kill me.</p>
<p>Like in good positions always.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t kill yourselves more importantly.</p>
<p>So why that matters is if we walk through strength,</p>
<p>the very first thing I&rsquo;m going to go through</p>
<p>is the exercise selection.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s choose an exercise</p>
<p>which ideally has a full range of motion or close to it</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t induce injury for you,</p>
<p>that you can still maintain good neck</p>
<p>and low back and in position and everything else,</p>
<p>you feel comfortable with.</p>
<p>So you can feel strong, but you don&rsquo;t feel like,</p>
<p>oh my gosh, if you&rsquo;ve never snatched before,</p>
<p>having you do a snatch for a maximum, even 75%,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s a terrible idea.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to feel confident</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be a train wreck.</p>
<p>I would rather put you on a machine bench press.</p>
<p>So you can go, I feel stable, I feel safe here.</p>
<p>I can just express my strength.</p>
<p>So exercise choice in generally,</p>
<p>in general, full range of motion.</p>
<p>And you want to kind of balance between the movement areas.</p>
<p>So this is an upper body press.</p>
<p>So this is pushing away from you,</p>
<p>bench press, things like that.</p>
<p>Upper body pull, pulling an implement towards you,</p>
<p>bent row, pull up.</p>
<p>The pressing should be horizontal.</p>
<p>So perpendicular to your body as well as vertical.</p>
<p>So this is lifting a weight over top of your head,</p>
<p>lifting away from you.</p>
<p>So the pull version is pulling horizontally to you</p>
<p>and pulling vertically down, pull up, things like that.</p>
<p>From the lower body, we typically call these hinges.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of a funny muscle thing</p>
<p>that no one&rsquo;s going to laugh at,</p>
<p>but like maybe me and you here,</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;ll categorize muscles as,</p>
<p>or movements, exercises as pushes and pulls, right?</p>
<p>So like a squat tends to be a push</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re pushing away the ground.</p>
<p>A deadlift is a pull</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re pulling the implement up to you.</p>
<p>But in reality, every single exercise is only ever a pull</p>
<p>because muscle doesn&rsquo;t push things away.</p>
<p>Muscle can only contract and pull on itself.</p>
<p>And so again, super nerdy thing that like,</p>
<p>most people are like, yeah,</p>
<p>and everyone&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s so dumb.</p>
<p>No, but I think it&rsquo;s a really important point</p>
<p>because it also speaks to something</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll get into later,</p>
<p>which is that posterior chain, anterior chain,</p>
<p>and if that&rsquo;s mysterious to people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll become clear before long.</p>
<p>Posterior chain, anterior chain makes a lot of sense to me</p>
<p>because of the way it&rsquo;s grounded</p>
<p>in the firing of motor neurons,</p>
<p>which is ultimately what controls muscle.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s also-</p>
<p>Feeling your nerves all the time.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So it also depends on the lens</p>
<p>through which one looks at life and exercise.</p>
<p>Of course, my lens is primarily neuroscience.</p>
<p>But I realized that the importance,</p>
<p>I like this idea of pushing perpendicular to the body,</p>
<p>overhead, pulling both toward the body and from overhead.</p>
<p>That just makes really good intuitive sense,</p>
<p>especially since a lot of people</p>
<p>were just listening to this and not watching it.</p>
<p>So in your minds, folks,</p>
<p>you can think about pushing away like a punch or overhead,</p>
<p>like lifting something overhead</p>
<p>and then pulling toward your midline</p>
<p>or toward your body rather,</p>
<p>and then pulling yourself up like a pull-up in PE class</p>
<p>for those of you that-</p>
<p>So the lower body is the same thing, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s some sort of pushing away like a squat</p>
<p>or a split squat or a lunge or something like that.</p>
<p>And then some sort of, again, we&rsquo;ll call pull or hinge.</p>
<p>So a deadlift or a Romanian deadlift or a hamstring curl</p>
<p>or something where you&rsquo;re contracting</p>
<p>and pulling the thing.</p>
<p>And you could split these</p>
<p>into like a thousand different categories</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re really in that field,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna wanna add a bunch of other ones,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s just like a rough conception.</p>
<p>So if you were going to do a single workout,</p>
<p>you could choose four exercises</p>
<p>and you could choose one of each.</p>
<p>One press, upper body press, one upper body pull,</p>
<p>one lower body hinge, one lower body press.</p>
<p>And that would be like a decently well-rounded exercise.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your exercise selection.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re taking those through a full range of motion,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re at a pretty good spot, as close as you can.</p>
<p>The next one is intensity.</p>
<p>So if you wanna develop strength,</p>
<p>this comes back to one of my favorite scientists</p>
<p>of all time, who happens to be a nerve guy, actually.</p>
<p>And generally I like to shit on nerves</p>
<p>as much as I possibly can,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m a muscle guy,</p>
<p>but I have to give Henneman some credit here, right?</p>
<p>And I know you know who that is.</p>
<p>Henneman&rsquo;s size principle.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course, right?</p>
<p>So this is a series of papers,</p>
<p>I think it was in nature.</p>
<p>At least some of them, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, in 1954, 56 or like something,</p>
<p>you can fact check me, I&rsquo;m sure you will.</p>
<p>But he basically outlined this idea that,</p>
<p>there is a certain recruitment threshold needed</p>
<p>for neurons to fire.</p>
<p>And we have muscle fibers in what we call fast twitch</p>
<p>muscle fibers and slow twitch muscle fibers.</p>
<p>And in general, you&rsquo;re going to activate</p>
<p>the slow twitch ones first,</p>
<p>because they tend to be associated</p>
<p>with low threshold motor neurons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not exactly that way, but it&rsquo;s close enough, right?</p>
<p>Well, the only way that you activate</p>
<p>some of these higher threshold neurons</p>
<p>is to demand the muscle to produce more force.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fairly specific to force, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something you can do over an endurance thing,</p>
<p>right, unless it gets really extreme and it happens.</p>
<p>So in general, the only way to use these big chunks</p>
<p>of your muscle, which are incredibly important</p>
<p>for aging, by the way, one of the major problems</p>
<p>we have with aging developing,</p>
<p>or development of aging related issues with muscle</p>
<p>is the fact that we lose fast twitch fibers preferentially.</p>
<p>And then we have major problems as we go down the line,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve lost a big chunk of our strength and size.</p>
<p>So you want to make sure these fibers stay alive and intact.</p>
<p>Okay, so with that being said,</p>
<p>the only way to develop strength</p>
<p>is then to challenge the muscle to produce more total force.</p>
<p>If you are fairly untrained or new,</p>
<p>I guess I should have stated this all</p>
<p>at the beginning as well.</p>
<p>One more inception, then I&rsquo;ll stop.</p>
<p>When it comes to this level of detail</p>
<p>of exercise prescription, a fairly untrained person</p>
<p>is gonna respond basically the same</p>
<p>to every single thing you do.</p>
<p>In fact, we&rsquo;ve done this in the lab many times.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done training studies,</p>
<p>doing things like 30 minutes of cycling</p>
<p>and seeing huge increases in muscle strength and size,</p>
<p>which is not a prescription for most people to increase size</p>
<p>but people that are really untrained,</p>
<p>if you did plyometrics or strength training</p>
<p>or endurance running,</p>
<p>they all just get better at everything.</p>
<p>So that caveat kind of aside,</p>
<p>if you want to be more intentional and more specific</p>
<p>to the goal of strength, you need to produce more force.</p>
<p>Specificity matters, right?</p>
<p>So we have size principle to help understand this</p>
<p>and we have our laws of specificity,</p>
<p>which say said principle, right?</p>
<p>Specific adaptation to imposed demand.</p>
<p>So the adaptation you get or the result of your training</p>
<p>is going to be a reflection of the demand that you imposed.</p>
<p>So if you want to get stronger,</p>
<p>you need to impose a demand of strength, not repetitions.</p>
<p>So this has to be, the load has to be very high.</p>
<p>In general, you&rsquo;re probably looking at above 85%</p>
<p>of your one rep max.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re moderately trained, maybe 75% will work.</p>
<p>Lowly trained, again, everything works.</p>
<p>But in general, we want to be pressing a load</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very high.</p>
<p>So because the intensity demand is so high,</p>
<p>that is going to enforce you to do a low repetition range.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do 12 reps at 95%.</p>
<p>Then it wouldn&rsquo;t be 95% of your one rep max.</p>
<p>So by definition, true strength training</p>
<p>is really going to be in like five repetitions per set</p>
<p>or less range.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where most of it&rsquo;s going to occur, the specificity.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve covered choice, intensity, and repetitions, right?</p>
<p>The total amount of sets that you do</p>
<p>is really kind of up to your personal fitness level, right?</p>
<p>If you did as little as like three sets per exercise,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably enough.</p>
<p>Work sets.</p>
<p>Totally, yeah, totally work sets, right.</p>
<p>So get fully warmed up and build up to that 85%.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t just walk into the gym and throw 85% on and go,</p>
<p>thank you, that&rsquo;s an important distinction.</p>
<p>So work your way up.</p>
<p>Do some, like a very classic warmup thing</p>
<p>would be like a set of 10 at 50%,</p>
<p>a set of eight at 60%,</p>
<p>a set of maybe eight again at 70%,</p>
<p>and then maybe like a set of five at 75%.</p>
<p>So two or three or four sets kind of building intensity</p>
<p>and lowering the rep range.</p>
<p>And then you would go after your two or three working sets.</p>
<p>Also, in terms of rest intervals,</p>
<p>now, because we&rsquo;re trying to,</p>
<p>the primary driver of strength is intensity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the volume, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the intensity.</p>
<p>So in order to maintain that,</p>
<p>we have to do a low repetition range,</p>
<p>but in addition, we also have to have a high rest interval.</p>
<p>Because if we start to,</p>
<p>if we have any amount of fatigue occur,</p>
<p>and we have to then either reduce the reps</p>
<p>or reduce the intensity,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve lost the primary driver.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve lost that main signal.</p>
<p>So the number we&rsquo;re gonna throw out typically</p>
<p>is like two to four minutes.</p>
<p>So imagine you did,</p>
<p>you know, your set of bench press,</p>
<p>and you did five repetitions at 85%.</p>
<p>You probably wanna rest two to four minutes</p>
<p>before coming back to the bench.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to sit there on your phone.</p>
<p>Like, in fact, please don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Everyone will thank you for not doing that, I promise.</p>
<p>You can engage other muscle groups.</p>
<p>This is what we call super setting.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re doing your bench press,</p>
<p>and while that two minute clock</p>
<p>is running for your chest to rest,</p>
<p>you can go over and do your deadlifts.</p>
<p>And so, you know, you can kind of move back and forth,</p>
<p>and this is how you can make strength training</p>
<p>not a seven hour workout.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a professional athlete,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna take that time</p>
<p>because you wanna maximize the outcome.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done this actually in our lab too.</p>
<p>Super sets will reduce the strength gains,</p>
<p>but by a tiny amount.</p>
<p>And most of us don&rsquo;t care enough</p>
<p>relative to it&rsquo;s going to triple</p>
<p>the length of your training session.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not worth it.</p>
<p>So for the average person, I will tell them,</p>
<p>yeah, super set.</p>
<p>For someone who&rsquo;s trying to break a world record</p>
<p>in weightlifting or powerlifting, I don&rsquo;t super set.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I&rsquo;ve found that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recover particularly well</p>
<p>from strength and hypertrophy training.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>Like in the workout or the next day?</p>
<p>From workout to workout,</p>
<p>unless I keep the total duration of those workouts,</p>
<p>I like to say no more than 60 minutes of work, of real work.</p>
<p>Yep, yep.</p>
<p>Maybe 75, past 75, I find that I just start to-</p>
<p>I have to introduce additional rest days</p>
<p>or I just get weaker over time.</p>
<p>So I set a kind of a limit at 50 minutes</p>
<p>and then I usually violate that limit</p>
<p>and end up doing 60 minutes.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m excited to hear that one can super set exercises</p>
<p>as long as they work different muscle groups, of course.</p>
<p>So I wouldn&rsquo;t want to do like bench press</p>
<p>and overhead press super set it</p>
<p>because we can eat.</p>
<p>I think that goes without saying for most people,</p>
<p>but just to point that out.</p>
<p>But that I could do some push, pull, push, pull</p>
<p>without compromising total intensity that much.</p>
<p>And I certainly would be willing to give up a rep here</p>
<p>or there or a few pounds here or there.</p>
<p>And may I ask whether or not in doing that</p>
<p>one gets any even tiny bit or more of additional benefit</p>
<p>in terms of cardiovascular work?</p>
<p>Because I imagine after even a one rep max,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve never done, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say I get three reps on the overhead press</p>
<p>and then I get four reps on a weighted pull up</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going back and forth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no doubt gonna be breathing harder</p>
<p>than if I was sitting there texting away on my phone</p>
<p>in between sets.</p>
<p>Yep, of course.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so in fact, in general,</p>
<p>one of the things that I&rsquo;ll present in my class</p>
<p>is a giant list of, in fact, on the top</p>
<p>is all these different exercise adaptations</p>
<p>I started the conversation with.</p>
<p>And on the vertical column are</p>
<p>as many of the physiological potential adaptations</p>
<p>one would get.</p>
<p>So changes in endogenous pH, blood pressure,</p>
<p>lymphatic changes, bone density, all these things, right?</p>
<p>And just have this giant list.</p>
<p>And then you can run a matrix</p>
<p>and you can start to look at, okay, if I do speed training,</p>
<p>am I gonna see changes in the nervous system?</p>
<p>Well, like very much so, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the primary actual reason those things work.</p>
<p>Very little change in the muscle system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost exclusively explained by the central</p>
<p>or peripheral nervous system, right?</p>
<p>On that same token, are you gonna expect</p>
<p>many cardiovascular adaptations from speed?</p>
<p>And the answer is no, because although we didn&rsquo;t cover it,</p>
<p>speed is very low intensity,</p>
<p>very low rep range, very high rest.</p>
<p>Well, as you go to like strength</p>
<p>and then you go to hypertrophy,</p>
<p>you start seeing more and more increases</p>
<p>in cardiovascular adaptations</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re doing exactly that, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re starting to reduce rest</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re starting to increase volume.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re gonna lose things like bone mineral adaptations</p>
<p>because the load starts to go down.</p>
<p>So you can look at this matrix and kind of understand</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m a person who wants to kind of maximize</p>
<p>the adaptations I get across my entire physiology</p>
<p>for the least amount of work,</p>
<p>you can choose these different adaptations to go after</p>
<p>that are gonna kind of land on these things, right?</p>
<p>And exactly as you mentioned,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to take five minutes rest between each rep,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s say the extreme,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to do three sets of one repetition</p>
<p>for strength at 95%.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna take probably five, maybe seven minutes</p>
<p>between each attempt.</p>
<p>Like you better not expect many like changes</p>
<p>in your resting blood pressure</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no cardiovascular strain there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna put it together in a circuit</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re gonna lose some potential strength adaptation,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re gonna gain something there.</p>
<p>So all these things are,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not about good or bad or right or wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always about what advantage do you want</p>
<p>and what disadvantage do you want?</p>
<p>And I can cut like really end to the chase here</p>
<p>on one of these things,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ll get to this eventually.</p>
<p>If you wanna know the ones that are going to generally</p>
<p>give you the most physiological adaptations</p>
<p>across the most categories,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re almost always looking</p>
<p>for hypertrophy type of training.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this anaerobic conditioning piece</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll get into.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna hit the most systems at once.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great to know.</p>
<p>And we should definitely go a little bit deeper</p>
<p>on those types of what the modifiable variables are</p>
<p>for those categories.</p>
<p>Because I think that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing the vast majority of people</p>
<p>want to be a bit stronger,</p>
<p>maybe add a little bit of muscle or more,</p>
<p>get, make sure their heart is healthy and et cetera.</p>
<p>This is wonderful.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s clarifying certainly a lot for me.</p>
<p>So for strength, let&rsquo;s, I guess, training frequency.</p>
<p>Frequency, cool.</p>
<p>So what should determine training frequency?</p>
<p>And I had the great benefit of a long time ago</p>
<p>when I was in high school, actually,</p>
<p>I paid for a session over the phone with Mike Menser.</p>
<p>Oh, lovely.</p>
<p>You know, the Mike Menser.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And we got to be friends over time.</p>
<p>High intensity training.</p>
<p>At the time I was pretty young</p>
<p>and my mother kept saying like,</p>
<p>why is this like grown man calling the house?</p>
<p>I mean, we would talk all the time about training,</p>
<p>but he tried to convince me to train once</p>
<p>every five to seven days, very few sets,</p>
<p>very high intensity.</p>
<p>And I must say it worked incredibly well.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>It was, I think with my recovery quotient,</p>
<p>which was not very good,</p>
<p>I think has improved over time, but it was not very good.</p>
<p>It was remarkable.</p>
<p>But of course, this was a time when I was, you know.</p>
<p>Full of the most animalism you&rsquo;ve ever had in your life.</p>
<p>I was on my own version of anabolics, right?</p>
<p>I was really heady.</p>
<p>I had a long arc of puberty.</p>
<p>And you were untrained.</p>
<p>And I was mostly untrained.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been running cross country</p>
<p>and skateboarding and playing soccer, so.</p>
<p>And doing all the things that are like</p>
<p>the antithesis of growing muscle.</p>
<p>It was literally, and people will probably say impossible,</p>
<p>it was something like 40 pounds of muscle</p>
<p>inside of 12 months.</p>
<p>It was crazy.</p>
<p>I would believe that.</p>
<p>You know, but, and so then of course</p>
<p>that stopped working over time.</p>
<p>And then you start going down the odyssey</p>
<p>of trying to find the thing that&rsquo;s gonna work that well.</p>
<p>And you eventually realized that</p>
<p>it was because you were untrained, right?</p>
<p>So training frequency is crucial.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that people are doing these whole body workouts</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;ve described them.</p>
<p>Not alternating upper body, lower body.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s so many different splits</p>
<p>that we probably doesn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>to go into splits right now.</p>
<p>But how often can and should one train a muscle?</p>
<p>And how do you know if a muscle is recovered locally?</p>
<p>And how do you know if your nervous system</p>
<p>is recovered systemically?</p>
<p>Okay, this is a bunch of really interesting questions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what route you wanna go.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll start here.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>soreness is not a good barometer of exercise quality.</p>
<p>Because some types of training</p>
<p>are going to induce more soreness</p>
<p>and some are going to induce less.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s important to this conversation</p>
<p>because when you ask about</p>
<p>how do you know if a muscle is ready to train again?</p>
<p>One of the questions is, what are you training for?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re training for hypertrophy, right?</p>
<p>Muscle size, muscle growth,</p>
<p>we need to hedge towards recovery.</p>
<p>Because what you&rsquo;re trying to do</p>
<p>is cause a massive insult there,</p>
<p>allow then protein synthesis to occur,</p>
<p>building of new tissue which takes time,</p>
<p>48 to 72 hours, like kind of at a minimum,</p>
<p>that process needs to occur.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing actually more strength,</p>
<p>and this is a differentiation</p>
<p>between hypertrophy and strength,</p>
<p>then you didn&rsquo;t induce actually much damage.</p>
<p>In fact, you&rsquo;re generally not going to get very sore</p>
<p>from true strength training, very little,</p>
<p>unless you get really heavy, you did a lot.</p>
<p>The primary driver of hypertrophy</p>
<p>is not the same primary driver of strength.</p>
<p>We talked about that already, that&rsquo;s intensity driven.</p>
<p>For hypertrophy, it&rsquo;s not intensity.</p>
<p>So because we have different mechanisms,</p>
<p>we have different outcomes,</p>
<p>even though they&rsquo;re closely aligned,</p>
<p>strength is not going to cause a lot of soreness.</p>
<p>Therefore, intensity is the driver.</p>
<p>Therefore, frequency can be as high as you want.</p>
<p>So you can train every single day the same exact muscle</p>
<p>if speed or power or strength</p>
<p>are the primary training tools,</p>
<p>because you need stimulus there, skill as well, right?</p>
<p>Practice, you know that as much as anybody.</p>
<p>Developing a new motor pattern</p>
<p>requires a lot of repetitions, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need a tremendous amount of rest.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a damage thing, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a repatterning issue.</p>
<p>So strength training, in fact, if you look at,</p>
<p>again, true strength professional athletes,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to train the same muscles basically every day.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to squat every day.</p>
<p>And is that because the primary mode of adaptation</p>
<p>is recruitment of these high threshold motor units?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s mainly neural?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So everyone&rsquo;s going to say that,</p>
<p>and this is where I get all feisty?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not saying that.</p>
<p>That was actually, there was a question mark there.</p>
<p>Okay, okay.</p>
<p>If we were online putting comments,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;d be a question mark.</p>
<p>We would have fought.</p>
<p>I would have blocked you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>I think you already blocked me.</p>
<p>Probably twice.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The early adaptations to exercise,</p>
<p>especially strength training,</p>
<p>are hedged towards the nervous system.</p>
<p>No question about it.</p>
<p>People always say central nervous system,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s probably more peripheral, right?</p>
<p>Whatever, semantics probably, but pedantic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nervous.</p>
<p>If you train today, tomorrow morning,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to wake up</p>
<p>with a actually increase in contractile proteins in muscle.</p>
<p>Your muscle might be a little bit bigger</p>
<p>due to some acute swelling,</p>
<p>but you could have a pretty acute</p>
<p>that persists change in the nervous system, we&rsquo;ll call it,</p>
<p>that allows you to be stronger within a couple of days.</p>
<p>Sustained hypertrophy is probably more</p>
<p>along the lines of four weeks,</p>
<p>where we can see that, right?</p>
<p>We can actually see changes like in the ultrasound.</p>
<p>Now, you&rsquo;re making changes immediately.</p>
<p>That protein synthesis process is happening very fast,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to last.</p>
<p>It just takes us time to measure it</p>
<p>in terms of a noticeable change in your whole muscle size.</p>
<p>So, that being said, the first four weeks</p>
<p>we typically will say are primarily nervous system.</p>
<p>After that, now we&rsquo;re starting to see</p>
<p>most of the changes coming from</p>
<p>the muscle side of the equation.</p>
<p>So, with strength development,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a combination of three areas.</p>
<p>In fact, all muscle contraction has these same three things.</p>
<p>It starts off with some signal, right,</p>
<p>from somewhere in the body,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s all the way up the top</p>
<p>or at the level of the spine,</p>
<p>depending on if this is a reaction</p>
<p>or an actual conscious control.</p>
<p>From there, that some signal</p>
<p>has to tell the muscle to contract, okay?</p>
<p>So, signal is one.</p>
<p>Two, it&rsquo;s muscular contraction.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of variables</p>
<p>inside the muscle tissue itself</p>
<p>that determine its functionality.</p>
<p>And so, if we took an individual biopsy</p>
<p>and took a muscle fiber from you and took one from me,</p>
<p>and we took those muscles out and put them in a Petri dish,</p>
<p>and I tied one end to a four-strand seducer,</p>
<p>the other end to a thing that pulls it,</p>
<p>and we soaked it in a bath of calcium</p>
<p>and a bunch of other stuff,</p>
<p>even if they were the same size,</p>
<p>your fibers might contract a lot faster than mine,</p>
<p>even relative to size,</p>
<p>or not, or slower, or there&rsquo;s various properties.</p>
<p>So, the intrinsic fibers themselves</p>
<p>determine a lot of functionality.</p>
<p>From there, muscle fibers don&rsquo;t cause movements.</p>
<p>Muscle fibers simply contract.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all surrounded with connective tissue,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s all surrounded</p>
<p>with a bunch of more connective tissue,</p>
<p>and that all surrounds into a muscle.</p>
<p>That muscle is then surrounded with more connective tissue.</p>
<p>That all comes together into a giant tendon,</p>
<p>that tendon attached to the bone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pulling on those tendon</p>
<p>that actually move the bone that cause human movement.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s area three.</p>
<p>Area one, the nervous system,</p>
<p>area two, the muscle contraction,</p>
<p>area three, some sort of connective tissue thing.</p>
<p>Changes happen at all three of those levels,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not even now talking,</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t even entered the discussion of biomechanics,</p>
<p>and you changed, say, the penation angle of the muscle,</p>
<p>which is the angle at which the muscle fibers lay</p>
<p>relative to the bone, right?</p>
<p>So, this is basic mechanics.</p>
<p>Is it pulling perpendicular to the bone?</p>
<p>Is it pulling horizontal to the bone,</p>
<p>or some sort of angle?</p>
<p>All of these things determine human performance.</p>
<p>So, when you&rsquo;re talking about, again,</p>
<p>that strength development,</p>
<p>you can see tremendous improvements</p>
<p>in total force production</p>
<p>by manipulating all of those areas,</p>
<p>and you have not touched changes in muscle size.</p>
<p>If you change muscle size in a true sustained fashion,</p>
<p>whether this is sarcoplasmic or contractile proteins,</p>
<p>you have given yourself more opportunity</p>
<p>to produce more force.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t guarantee you produce more force.</p>
<p>Bodybuilders are not stronger than power lifters,</p>
<p>even though they have more muscle,</p>
<p>but bodybuilders are probably stronger than most people.</p>
<p>So, there is a relationship</p>
<p>between muscle size and strength.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not a one-to-one guaranteed ratio,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s generally because the,</p>
<p>although the muscle has been aided,</p>
<p>they may have not changed the biomechanical considerations,</p>
<p>they may have not changed the connective tissue,</p>
<p>nor the nervous system stuff.</p>
<p>And so, that&rsquo;s why we see this giant relationship</p>
<p>that our value is pretty high</p>
<p>between strength and hypertrophy,</p>
<p>but if you really wanna get to the ends of it, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>And that matters to your actual question 10 minutes ago,</p>
<p>because again, you can train strength daily</p>
<p>on the same muscle,</p>
<p>but if you want to allow for that process</p>
<p>of contractile proteins to add and grow,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re gonna have to allow some recovery,</p>
<p>because if you go back into that muscle too soon,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna blunt the response,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna stop it, you&rsquo;re gonna cut it off.</p>
<p>You have all kinds of problems going on in the cell</p>
<p>that are gonna just attenuate that growth response.</p>
<p>So, I gave you the answer for strength training.</p>
<p>The answer for hypertrophy is probably less than 3 out of 10</p>
<p>on level of soreness, you can go again.</p>
<p>In general, you&rsquo;re probably looking at 72 hours</p>
<p>is the optimal window.</p>
<p>So, if you trained your shoulders on Monday,</p>
<p>you probably wouldn&rsquo;t wanna train them again on Tuesday.</p>
<p>If hypertrophy&rsquo;s the goal, maybe Wednesday,</p>
<p>maybe Thursday&rsquo;s best.</p>
<p>So, something like an every two to three day window</p>
<p>is probably, and we know a little bit more now</p>
<p>about why that is.</p>
<p>The gene cascade, the signaling response happens,</p>
<p>well, the signaling happens instantaneously, right?</p>
<p>Within seconds.</p>
<p>The gene cascade is probably peaked in the four hour window,</p>
<p>like depending on which gene you wanna look at,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just kind of a snapshot.</p>
<p>But the protein synthesis process is 24 to 48 hour thing.</p>
<p>And so, it tends to kind of look like,</p>
<p>let that thing finish and let that signal go back</p>
<p>to the baseline, and then hit it again,</p>
<p>and then hit it again.</p>
<p>And now, as long as you&rsquo;re providing the nutrients,</p>
<p>the recovery should happen, and you should be able</p>
<p>to sustain the same work output in the training session,</p>
<p>so the stimulus stays high, and the recovery&rsquo;s there,</p>
<p>and you can now continue to grow muscle.</p>
<p>You mentioned 48 to 72 hours for hypertrophy.</p>
<p>What if, for whatever reasons,</p>
<p>the training split, lifestyle factors, et cetera,</p>
<p>somebody, say, let&rsquo;s use your example,</p>
<p>trains shoulders on Monday.</p>
<p>Ideally, they would train them again on Thursday,</p>
<p>in their particular instance,</p>
<p>somewhere Wednesday or Thursday, but they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They wait until Saturday or Sunday for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s more compatible with their work,</p>
<p>work and other exercise schedule, whatever the reason.</p>
<p>Are they actually losing hypertrophy that they gained,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ve missed a window to induce further hypertrophy?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably better to think about it the latter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that you&rsquo;ve lost,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just you&rsquo;ve just kind of lost an opportunity</p>
<p>to make more progress.</p>
<p>I will save you a little bit,</p>
<p>and kind of going back to your HIIT program.</p>
<p>This is the original high-intensity training,</p>
<p>the Mensor thing, right?</p>
<p>Which is not-</p>
<p>The HIIT with one I,</p>
<p>not the high-intensity interval training,</p>
<p>but high-intensity training,</p>
<p>like one set to absolute failure,</p>
<p>maybe two for each muscle group.</p>
<p>20-minute workouts.</p>
<p>Dividing your body into a three-way split,</p>
<p>and then literally training like six times a month,</p>
<p>which most people would think that is absolutely crazy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way that&rsquo;s gonna work.</p>
<p>And I can tell you, if you are untrained,</p>
<p>you grow like a weed.</p>
<p>Just if you train hard enough.</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re trained,</p>
<p>look at the people Mike trained.</p>
<p>He put a lot of bodybuilders on really high levels.</p>
<p>Now, they had the same similar help you had</p>
<p>at that timeframe.</p>
<p>Wait, to be very clear,</p>
<p>I was not taking exogenous out of the box.</p>
<p>In fact, I was-</p>
<p>But your endogenous was just as good.</p>
<p>I probably was.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t measuring my levels there,</p>
<p>but I probably would.</p>
<p>I grew easy.</p>
<p>And in general,</p>
<p>I tend to grow pretty easily from weight training.</p>
<p>But the,</p>
<p>and I should say that to Mike&rsquo;s credit,</p>
<p>and I think this is an important message,</p>
<p>that he was the one who really said,</p>
<p>look, unless you&rsquo;re gonna make</p>
<p>a professional career out of it,</p>
<p>do not run the health hazards of exogenous hormones.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly not at your age.</p>
<p>So he deterred me from that,</p>
<p>which was great because it never entered my mind.</p>
<p>It just was one of those things where</p>
<p>Mike Mencer said, don&rsquo;t do it,</p>
<p>and he had clearly done it, right?</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s speaking from an informed place.</p>
<p>It never entered my mind.</p>
<p>But also, what was really wild</p>
<p>is I was continuing to run cross-country.</p>
<p>And so there was a trade-off there at some point.</p>
<p>A little bit of an interference.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re young,</p>
<p>you can get,</p>
<p>many people can get away with what at this age</p>
<p>would surely place me into a state of overtraining,</p>
<p>even at low volume.</p>
<p>Well, I mean,</p>
<p>the whole field on interference effects</p>
<p>has changed quite a bit recently,</p>
<p>which we can come back to if you want.</p>
<p>But just to finish out the idea here</p>
<p>with that last question,</p>
<p>if you wanna take five days or six days</p>
<p>in between each muscle group,</p>
<p>you can do that.</p>
<p>In fact, if you look at the research,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna show that frequency is not that important.</p>
<p>It will,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s unimportant,</p>
<p>but it can handle changes</p>
<p>as long as you get to the same total volume.</p>
<p>So you can do that.</p>
<p>You just have to do a lot more work in that one workout.</p>
<p>If you care about the six week,</p>
<p>eight week thing,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in this for the next 60 years,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s probably okay, right?</p>
<p>But it can be there.</p>
<p>The challenge with splitting up your training sessions</p>
<p>for hypertrophy into smaller numbers,</p>
<p>like once or twice a week,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just difficult to get that number.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s typical to get that volume done.</p>
<p>Volume wise,</p>
<p>the more recent meta-analyses are gonna say</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re probably looking at around 10 working sets</p>
<p>per muscle group per week.</p>
<p>Seems to be kind of the minimum threshold</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna wanna hit.</p>
<p>So if you did three sets of 10 at your shoulders on Monday,</p>
<p>three sets of 10 shoulders Wednesday</p>
<p>and three on Friday,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s nine working sets.</p>
<p>If you wanted to do three different shoulder exercises</p>
<p>on Monday and hit your nine sets,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not really actually gonna be that much different.</p>
<p>The problem is 10 is kind of the minimum.</p>
<p>You probably wanna look for more like 15 to 20</p>
<p>and in fact, well-trained folks, 20, 25.</p>
<p>That becomes very challenging in one workout.</p>
<p>In fact, defunct, you&rsquo;re not gonna be able to do it, right?</p>
<p>And so that is where it&rsquo;s not the frequency</p>
<p>that looks like it kills you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the fact you have got to get</p>
<p>because the total driver of strength is intensity,</p>
<p>but the total driver of hypertrophy is volume.</p>
<p>Assume you&rsquo;re taking it to fatigue, right?</p>
<p>Or muscular failure.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just tough to get enough done.</p>
<p>If you can and if you wanna set your schedule up that way,</p>
<p>like you probably remember,</p>
<p>if you do those types of training sessions</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re just gonna completely exhaust a muscle,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be sore for a while.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably not going to come back</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s sort of the logic behind that</p>
<p>was let&rsquo;s take this thing to tremendous failure</p>
<p>and give it six days to recover.</p>
<p>It can work, it&rsquo;s just not the best,</p>
<p>I think is one way to think about it for most people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also hard to do those workouts</p>
<p>without a training partner</p>
<p>if you really wanna do them correctly.</p>
<p>And stimulants and headphones</p>
<p>and all kinds of other things, right?</p>
<p>Well, anyway, yeah, stimulants or not,</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t recommend those.</p>
<p>It may be a cup of coffee or two if that&rsquo;s your thing,</p>
<p>and maybe some of the safer supplements,</p>
<p>but certainly not the sorts of stimulants</p>
<p>that the guys in the 70s and 80s were famous for taking.</p>
<p>Or still use.</p>
<p>You talked about repetition ranges</p>
<p>broadly for strength training, so five or less.</p>
<p>You said frequency could be as often as every day.</p>
<p>Rest two to four minutes, maybe even longer</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going for one repetition maximum.</p>
<p>For hypertrophy, what are the repetition ranges</p>
<p>that are effective and what are the ones</p>
<p>that are most effective if one is trying</p>
<p>to maximize some of the other variables?</p>
<p>Like people don&rsquo;t wanna spend more than an hour</p>
<p>to 75 minutes in the gym.</p>
<p>Because I think that while the rep ranges</p>
<p>might be quite broad, as you alluded to earlier,</p>
<p>there are the practical constraints.</p>
<p>So what repetition ranges or percent</p>
<p>of one repetition maximum should people consider</p>
<p>when thinking about hypertrophy?</p>
<p>Right, the quick answer there is anywhere</p>
<p>between like five to 30 reps per set.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna show across the literature</p>
<p>pretty much equal hypertrophy gains.</p>
<p>And we could have a really interesting discussion</p>
<p>about why that is, but I&rsquo;m just remembering</p>
<p>one thing from a second ago.</p>
<p>I wanna give a better answer for the frequency.</p>
<p>You can do every single week for strength</p>
<p>or every single day for strength.</p>
<p>If you want though like what&rsquo;s probably minimally viable,</p>
<p>two, twice per week per muscle.</p>
<p>So hamstrings, strength twice per week.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good number to get most people really strong.</p>
<p>You can do every single day.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to though.</p>
<p>So I wanna make sure that like I wasn&rsquo;t saying</p>
<p>you have to train a muscle 85% every single day</p>
<p>to get it strong.</p>
<p>Two is a good number.</p>
<p>Three is great, but probably even two is really effective.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>And this explains that the high frequency</p>
<p>of training for strength athletes</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s always mystified me.</p>
<p>And the very long workouts make sense</p>
<p>because very long.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna even train twice a day.</p>
<p>Like even though the squat in the morning,</p>
<p>squat in the afternoon, every day.</p>
<p>With their eating and their sleeping,</p>
<p>they probably don&rsquo;t have time for anything else.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re pros.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a job, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they do.</p>
<p>So yeah, your hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Strength training programming is somewhat complicated</p>
<p>because of that&rsquo;s not the danger,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re gonna have to pay one way or the other, right?</p>
<p>The risk is a little bit higher</p>
<p>because the load&rsquo;s higher</p>
<p>and you have to be a little bit more technically proficient.</p>
<p>When it comes to hypertrophy training,</p>
<p>the way I like to explain it is it&rsquo;s kind of idiot proof.</p>
<p>The programming is idiot proof.</p>
<p>The work is hard though.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s your range.</p>
<p>Anywhere between five reps and 30.</p>
<p>Can you hit somewhere in there?</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all equally effective.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t screw that up.</p>
<p>The only caveat for hypertrophy</p>
<p>is you have to take it to muscular failure.</p>
<p>And you need enough rest for the adaptation</p>
<p>and protein synthesis to occur.</p>
<p>And if you recover faster,</p>
<p>you can maybe do it more frequently.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t, maybe less frequently.</p>
<p>By that logic, should people perhaps experiment</p>
<p>and figure out what repetition range</p>
<p>allows them to recover in concert</p>
<p>with the training frequency that they can do consistently?</p>
<p>My recommendation is I think you should actually</p>
<p>use the repetition range as a way to have some variation</p>
<p>because most people don&rsquo;t wanna go in the gym</p>
<p>and do three sets of 10.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna get very bored very quickly.</p>
<p>And so I think you should actually</p>
<p>intentionally change the rep schemes</p>
<p>for simple sake of having more fun.</p>
<p>It is a very different challenge.</p>
<p>The mechanisms that are inducing hypertrophy are different,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s only a maximum amount of growth</p>
<p>that one can get, right?</p>
<p>And so you have, as best we think it now,</p>
<p>and some people actually will espouse</p>
<p>that we know really clearly</p>
<p>about the mechanisms of muscle hypertrophy.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still very much a guessing game,</p>
<p>but the three most likely drivers</p>
<p>are one, metabolic stress,</p>
<p>two, mechanical tension,</p>
<p>and then three, muscular damage.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to have all three.</p>
<p>One is sufficient.</p>
<p>You can have a little bit of one or two,</p>
<p>and you can kind of, so you get it to play here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already talked about the muscular damage.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s very clear.</p>
<p>More damage is not better,</p>
<p>but it is somewhat a decent proxy, right?</p>
<p>Like again, a little bit of soreness is good.</p>
<p>Just don&rsquo;t get so sore it&rsquo;s compromising your total volume.</p>
<p>All right?</p>
<p>Mechanical tension is kind of like strength,</p>
<p>and this is why if you do even sets of five or eight,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re kind of close to that strength range,</p>
<p>you will gain a little bit of muscle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not optimal muscle gain,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re gonna gain some</p>
<p>because everything in these,</p>
<p>like physiology isn&rsquo;t cut off at four reps,</p>
<p>and then five reps is a different thing, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always a blend,</p>
<p>so think of it as like a fading curve.</p>
<p>As you get closer to the end, it fades less effective.</p>
<p>As you get closer to the middle, it&rsquo;s more effective.</p>
<p>Anywhere between eight reps per set to 30,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s equally effective.</p>
<p>Past 30, it&rsquo;s gonna blend out.</p>
<p>Past eight to five to four to three,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna blend, you know, lesser there.</p>
<p>So metabolic stress is one, the damage is the other,</p>
<p>or sorry, mechanical tension is the one that&rsquo;s heavy.</p>
<p>Muscle damage is the other one.</p>
<p>The third one is metabolic stress,</p>
<p>and this is a bit of an area of scientific contention,</p>
<p>but something&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>I know something&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just kind of fumbling</p>
<p>to figure out what exactly it is,</p>
<p>and this is, metabolic stress is the burn, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why blood flow restriction training probably works.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s done very light, so there&rsquo;s no mechanical tension.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very little damage,</p>
<p>but somehow it induces a good amount of hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Very painful.</p>
<p>Oh, boy.</p>
<p>I tried this.</p>
<p>I have a friend, former special operator,</p>
<p>who was out on the East Coast</p>
<p>and took me through a blood flow restriction</p>
<p>training protocol in a park,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think I actually cried.</p>
<p>You probably did.</p>
<p>But I might have cried out once or twice.</p>
<p>It was unbelievable,</p>
<p>especially the lower body movements.</p>
<p>Now, it was a humid day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll claim a little bit of jet lag,</p>
<p>but it was brutal.</p>
<p>It was really brutal, and I also-</p>
<p>Do it on the best day of your life,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s still brutal.</p>
<p>Okay, well, that makes me feel a little bit better.</p>
<p>It was intense, and people should know</p>
<p>that it is important to use the proper cuffs</p>
<p>for these things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any relationship</p>
<p>to any of the companies that sell these cuffs,</p>
<p>but the reason is that you actually need</p>
<p>to block particular avenues of blood flow.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t simply cinch off a muscle.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t tourniquet a muscle and train.</p>
<p>You can actually kill yourself that way.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can get a blood clot.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so if you&rsquo;re interested</p>
<p>in blood flow restriction training,</p>
<p>I imagine you have some content about this</p>
<p>or will at some point,</p>
<p>but also there are resources online</p>
<p>that people can look up.</p>
<p>A question about hypertrophy training</p>
<p>that I think many people are wondering about.</p>
<p>Train to failure or don&rsquo;t train to failure?</p>
<p>Assuming good form.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, assuming good form, great.</p>
<p>The answer is both.</p>
<p>So you want to train to failure,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t need to go to extreme failure.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t need to necessarily go to that,</p>
<p>like a partner has to lift the barbell off my chest,</p>
<p>but you have to get close.</p>
<p>You have to drive either heavy stress,</p>
<p>damage, right, or pump.</p>
<p>And so a really easy practical way to think about this,</p>
<p>I heard Mike Isretel,</p>
<p>who runs a company called Renaissance Periodization,</p>
<p>years ago outlined this at a NSCA talk.</p>
<p>And it was beautiful.</p>
<p>And I thought this is the most eloquent way</p>
<p>to explain the context about training for hypertrophy.</p>
<p>So only to look for three things in your workout.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s say that you have a particular muscle to grow.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you want your glutes to get larger.</p>
<p>Okay, when you&rsquo;re doing your glute exercises,</p>
<p>number one, are you feeling the glute contract?</p>
<p>Okay, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be there,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a good sign if it is.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s say I didn&rsquo;t really feel my glute contract.</p>
<p>I felt it more in my quads or my back.</p>
<p>Okay, did you feel a big pump afterwards?</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t really feel a pump there either words,</p>
<p>or during.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>Number three, next day,</p>
<p>did you feel a little bit of soreness there at all?</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a very good indication.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t feel it during the workout.</p>
<p>You felt no sort of pump and it didn&rsquo;t get sore.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t expect much growth.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>You distributed the work across a bunch of muscle groups.</p>
<p>Most likely other muscle groups were too involved, right?</p>
<p>Especially if you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>no, but man, my back got really sore.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a really good indication</p>
<p>of telling you what the hell was moving.</p>
<p>And so in terms of targets,</p>
<p>if you were to put, again, a one to 10 scale,</p>
<p>how much should I feel it burning during?</p>
<p>Anything less than a three,</p>
<p>okay, it&rsquo;s probably not doing much, right?</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t, like seven is not,</p>
<p>a 10 is not better than seven.</p>
<p>You need to feel it, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be like,</p>
<p>oh my gosh, I&rsquo;m dying here.</p>
<p>Soreness, same barometer, right?</p>
<p>So if you can get like three, three, and three,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably in a pretty good spot.</p>
<p>Five, five, and five is maybe better,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t need to go much past that.</p>
<p>So I want you to feel the muscle group either working,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re like, oh, I didn&rsquo;t feel it much,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really get a pump,</p>
<p>but the next day it got really sore,</p>
<p>well then you&rsquo;re still on a good path.</p>
<p>Again, really sore isn&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>whoo, a little tender, but next day it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>The day after that, I could train, no problem.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really what you wanna go after.</p>
<p>And in terms of understanding,</p>
<p>is this likely to produce some growth or not?</p>
<p>Excellent, excellent, very clear parameters</p>
<p>and recommendations I know are benefiting me</p>
<p>and will benefit a lot of people.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d be willing to throw out a few</p>
<p>sort of sets and rep parameters</p>
<p>that could act as broad guidelines</p>
<p>for people who want to explore further.</p>
<p>I realized that with all these modifiable variables,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no one size fits all for strength.</p>
<p>I love this five to 30 for hypertrophy,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a pretty vital thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever done a 30 rep set of anything,</p>
<p>but now that you&rsquo;ve thrown that out there,</p>
<p>I see it as a bit of a challenge.</p>
<p>You wanna know what&rsquo;s awesome about 30?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get an insane pump.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna burn like crazy, but you won&rsquo;t get super sore</p>
<p>because the mechanical tension is so low, it&rsquo;s so light.</p>
<p>So you can get away with those things</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hard because your mind is gonna wander.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get it like rep 20 and you&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, no, there&rsquo;s a lot left here to get to 30,</p>
<p>where like a set of 10 is much easier.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re just like, okay, two more, two more.</p>
<p>Set of 30 is like, I got 16 more, it&rsquo;s awful.</p>
<p>Just the counting is work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terrible, right?</p>
<p>And people tend to just kind of like check out.</p>
<p>So 30 is possible, but a little bit extreme.</p>
<p>But I would recommend all of them.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a really fun play.</p>
<p>You can do different in the same workout too, by the way.</p>
<p>Like you could do one set of 10 pushups</p>
<p>and then take a little break and then do a set of 25.</p>
<p>You can mix and match these things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no magic recipe that has to happen for all those,</p>
<p>or do it different.</p>
<p>So Mondays are my sets of 10 days.</p>
<p>Wednesdays are my set of 20 days</p>
<p>and Fridays are my set of 30 days.</p>
<p>And you can have all kinds of fun there</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hard to screw up.</p>
<p>Great, I love that phrase is always reassuring.</p>
<p>So for strength, is there a sets and reps protocol</p>
<p>that is pretty surefire?</p>
<p>So a way to just think about a really fast answer for power,</p>
<p>well, speed, power and strength</p>
<p>is what I just call the three to five concept, right?</p>
<p>So pick three to five exercises.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re feeling better that day,</p>
<p>choose on the higher end.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re feeling less that day</p>
<p>or you have a shorter timeframe to train, go less.</p>
<p>So this would be three sets or three exercises rather</p>
<p>or five exercises the most.</p>
<p>So three to five exercises,</p>
<p>do three to five reps, three to five sets,</p>
<p>take three to five minutes rest in between</p>
<p>and do it three to five times a week.</p>
<p>So that can be as little as three sets of three</p>
<p>for three exercises, three times a week.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a 20 minute workout three times a week.</p>
<p>It can be as high as five sets of five</p>
<p>for five exercises, five days a week.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very broad and allows people to still stay</p>
<p>within the domains of strength and power</p>
<p>while still being able to move</p>
<p>and contour tour their lifestyle</p>
<p>and soreness and time and all those things.</p>
<p>The only differentiator to pay attention to</p>
<p>between power and strength is intensity.</p>
<p>So if you want strength,</p>
<p>this is now 85% plus of your max, right?</p>
<p>If you want power, it needs to be a lot lighter</p>
<p>because you need to move more towards the velocity</p>
<p>end of the spectrum</p>
<p>because power is strength multiplied by speed.</p>
<p>So while getting stronger by definition can help power,</p>
<p>you probably wanna spend more of your time</p>
<p>in the 40% to 70% range, like plus or minus.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Both of them conceptually they&rsquo;ll work everything else.</p>
<p>The exercise, the reps, the frequency,</p>
<p>all that can be still in the three to five range.</p>
<p>Just change the intensity</p>
<p>depending on which outcome you want.</p>
<p>The nervous system obviously plays an important role</p>
<p>at the level of nerves</p>
<p>controlling the contraction of muscle fibers.</p>
<p>But of course we have these upper motor neurons,</p>
<p>which are the ones that reside in our brain</p>
<p>that control the lower motor neurons that control muscle.</p>
<p>And this takes us into the realm</p>
<p>of where the mind is at during a particular movement.</p>
<p>And to me, this is not an abstract thing.</p>
<p>I can imagine doing workouts</p>
<p>that are mainly focused on strength</p>
<p>or mainly focused on hypertrophy.</p>
<p>And in the case of strength,</p>
<p>am I trying to move weights?</p>
<p>And when I&rsquo;m trying to generate hypertrophy,</p>
<p>am I trying to quote unquote challenge muscles?</p>
<p>In other words, if I am just trying to move a weight</p>
<p>away from my body, pushing a bench press</p>
<p>or an overhead press, I don&rsquo;t know that I want my mind</p>
<p>thinking about the contraction of my medial delts.</p>
<p>I think I want my mind in getting the weight overhead</p>
<p>with the best proper form, best, excuse me, and proper form.</p>
<p>And certainly with hypertrophy training,</p>
<p>best and proper form is going to be the target as well.</p>
<p>But that simple, or I should say,</p>
<p>subtle mental shift changes the patterns</p>
<p>of nerve fiber recruitment.</p>
<p>So can we say to get stronger,</p>
<p>focus on moving weights still with proper form and safely,</p>
<p>and to get hypertrophy, focus on challenging muscles</p>
<p>still with proper form and safely?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very fair.</p>
<p>Yeah, as a snapshot answer,</p>
<p>it is a very fair thing to think about.</p>
<p>Intentionality matters for both.</p>
<p>In other words, if you look at some interesting science</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been done on power development and speed development,</p>
<p>the intent to move is actually more important</p>
<p>than the actual movement velocity.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re doing, say, something for power or strength,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing just enough to get the bar up,</p>
<p>that will result in less improvements in strength</p>
<p>than even if you&rsquo;re moving at the exact same speed,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re intending to move faster.</p>
<p>And this is one of the reasons why good coaching matters.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re coaching an athlete</p>
<p>through a power workout especially,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re doing enough to just lift 50%</p>
<p>of their one rep max,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to generate as much speed development</p>
<p>as them trying to move that bar as fast as they can,</p>
<p>even if the net result is the same barbell velocity.</p>
<p>Turns out nerves matter.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I mean, I was about to say amazing,</p>
<p>but as a neuroscientist,</p>
<p>if I say amazing that nerves matter,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s amazing to me is if I understand correctly,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re saying is that even if the bar is moving</p>
<p>at the same speed, same weight,</p>
<p>if my internal representation, my thoughts are,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to move this as fast as possible</p>
<p>versus I&rsquo;m just trying to get the bar away from me</p>
<p>and get the weight up, I&rsquo;m going to get different outcomes.</p>
<p>Yep, this is quality of work, right?</p>
<p>Did you do enough to just check off the box</p>
<p>or did you actually strive for adaptation, right?</p>
<p>Similar concept actually works for hypertrophy</p>
<p>in terms of there is a handful of very recent studies</p>
<p>that have looked at what we&rsquo;ll call</p>
<p>the mind muscle connection.</p>
<p>And this is doing things like imagine a bicep curl</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re simply looking at and watching your biceps</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re thinking about contracting it harder,</p>
<p>even though you execute the same repetitions</p>
<p>at the same exact intensity,</p>
<p>initial indications are the mind body connection</p>
<p>are going to result in more growth than not.</p>
<p>You just gave authorization for people</p>
<p>to look at their muscles contracting in the gym.</p>
<p>Please do, yeah, of course, right?</p>
<p>But the selfie is still ruled out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather you look at your muscles than your phone.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m fine with it.</p>
<p>Those are initial, we don&rsquo;t have a large depth of research</p>
<p>to support that and maybe some stuff will come</p>
<p>and counter it, but it does, it matches what folks</p>
<p>in that community have been saying</p>
<p>for a very long time, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually some stuff on simply flexing in between.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve ever seen a bodybuilder,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll do their set of bicep curls</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll get out and they&rsquo;ll flex and they&rsquo;ll check</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re literally, this is what Arnold did, right?</p>
<p>This is if you go back to pumping an iron.</p>
<p>Or college weight rooms, I should say.</p>
<p>For some reason, there&rsquo;s something about that age group.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of checking of biceps in college weight rooms</p>
<p>for reasons that escape me.</p>
<p>If you ever interact with my wife,</p>
<p>like she will be the first to tell you</p>
<p>I cannot walk past a mirror without like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m checking something out.</p>
<p>That you can&rsquo;t or that she can&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Not her, me.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m the one that cannot walk past.</p>
<p>All right, well then I&rsquo;ll be careful not to disparage that.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with the hypertrophy,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just like, I&rsquo;m a muscle guy.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m always like thinking and tinkering or whatever.</p>
<p>But yeah, it is, I think it&rsquo;s very much worth your time</p>
<p>to do a higher quality training session,</p>
<p>be more intentional, be present,</p>
<p>than just executing the same exact workout.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s globally very clear to be to your advantage.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re thinking, look, I&rsquo;m gonna,</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t wanna work out today.</p>
<p>I got all this going on or I&rsquo;m tired or whatever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna do the workout anyways and get through it.</p>
<p>Okay, if you can go, you know what though?</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m gonna cut 15 minutes out of this thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get my head right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go get 20 minutes of quality work done.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your best option by far.</p>
<p>You alluded to the fact that</p>
<p>even just looking at a particular muscle</p>
<p>might benefit in terms of the number of fibers</p>
<p>you can recruit or its potential for hypertrophy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard before and I certainly have experienced</p>
<p>that muscles that for whatever reason,</p>
<p>genetics or sports that one played, et cetera,</p>
<p>muscles that we find that we can contract</p>
<p>to the point of almost a slightly painful contraction</p>
<p>seem to grow more readily</p>
<p>than muscles that we can&rsquo;t recruit very easily.</p>
<p>And the reason I mentioned sports that we played earlier</p>
<p>is you just have to watch the Olympics</p>
<p>to see that swimmers obviously</p>
<p>are very good at engaging their lats.</p>
<p>You look at the gymnasts,</p>
<p>they seem to be very good at engaging everything.</p>
<p>And they go through a huge number</p>
<p>of different dynamic movements.</p>
<p>So that explains that.</p>
<p>So I find that, you know, if people say,</p>
<p>oh, you know, I can&rsquo;t get stronger in this</p>
<p>or my whatever body part is weak</p>
<p>in terms of its inability to engage hypertrophy,</p>
<p>that oftentimes that can be because of an inability</p>
<p>to engage those upper motor neurons</p>
<p>to deliberately isolate those muscles.</p>
<p>Are there ways that people can learn</p>
<p>to engage particular muscle groups</p>
<p>more effectively over time</p>
<p>for sake of hypertrophy or strength,</p>
<p>or for cases of trying to overcome injury potential</p>
<p>or injury because imbalances are bad across the board?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is actually very common.</p>
<p>And I think everyone has probably gone through this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some part that you just can&rsquo;t get going.</p>
<p>For me, that was the lats.</p>
<p>That was the rhomboids, so my back muscles.</p>
<p>For years, I couldn&rsquo;t activate my lats or my rhomboids.</p>
<p>These are the muscle groups</p>
<p>that connect your shoulder blades.</p>
<p>So if you try to squeeze your shoulder blades together,</p>
<p>that set of muscles there are called your rhomboids.</p>
<p>Your lats, of course, are more vertical</p>
<p>and pull you kind of up and down.</p>
<p>And no matter how many lat pull-downs I did,</p>
<p>bent rows, pull-ups,</p>
<p>I could never see any development there,</p>
<p>no increase in strength.</p>
<p>And it took me probably a decade</p>
<p>to figure out how the hell to actually get these things on.</p>
<p>In fact, if you would have asked me,</p>
<p>even in my college years as a college football player,</p>
<p>hey, flex your lats, like show me your lats,</p>
<p>you would have seen no movement there.</p>
<p>When I was doing a pull-up, in that particular case,</p>
<p>the only way I could get the bar to move</p>
<p>was by using my biceps, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a synergistic muscle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s supposed to be a secondary or tertiary muscle</p>
<p>in that movement, but for me, it was primer</p>
<p>because of my over-strength in my biceps</p>
<p>coupled with my lack of activation in the lats.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re compensating the same movement.</p>
<p>Actually, kind of an easy way to think about this</p>
<p>is imagine doing a bent row.</p>
<p>So imagine you&rsquo;re bent over kind of at a 45 degree</p>
<p>or a horizontal angle, and you&rsquo;re gonna pull a barbell</p>
<p>to your belly button, all right?</p>
<p>Now, you can actually do that exact same movement</p>
<p>with very little back muscle activation</p>
<p>by simply flexing your elbows more.</p>
<p>And so you think the barbell&rsquo;s going all the way down,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s coming all the way up to touching my belly,</p>
<p>and you think you&rsquo;re doing a great</p>
<p>back development exercise, when in fact,</p>
<p>because of the way that you&rsquo;re executing the movement,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting very little back development.</p>
<p>And this is a really good example</p>
<p>of why someone has done a specific exercise</p>
<p>many, many, many times, but yet failed to see development</p>
<p>in a muscle group, which goes back</p>
<p>to earlier part of our conversation,</p>
<p>which is why exercises themselves</p>
<p>do not determine the adaptation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the execution that matters, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the technique, it&rsquo;s the rep range,</p>
<p>all of those are gonna determine your actual result.</p>
<p>So if anytime you&rsquo;re banging your head against the wall</p>
<p>and thinking like, why am I not getting movement here,</p>
<p>growth or strength or whatever,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost one of those,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s guaranteed to be one of those areas, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably not getting the muscle groups to activate.</p>
<p>In that particular example, just because we&rsquo;re here,</p>
<p>try, imagine doing that bent row.</p>
<p>Instead of pulling the barbell to your belly,</p>
<p>squeeze your shoulder blades together first,</p>
<p>as far as they can possibly go,</p>
<p>and then bring your elbows up</p>
<p>without changing the angle of your elbow.</p>
<p>So in other words, without bringing your hand</p>
<p>closer to your shoulder.</p>
<p>So keep that same angle and come up</p>
<p>as high as you possibly can,</p>
<p>and then finish out the movement.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to guarantee a utilization first</p>
<p>of the back muscles and a finishing with the biceps</p>
<p>at the end, which is how that movement is supposed to go.</p>
<p>So how do you coach into that?</p>
<p>Well, it can be a number of things.</p>
<p>Whenever I&rsquo;m diagnosing movement quality,</p>
<p>I look for a handful of things,</p>
<p>but very first one is awareness.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be surprised how many folks,</p>
<p>when you just simply tell them that muscle group right there</p>
<p>and maybe you give them a tactical prompt,</p>
<p>so you touch it or you put something against it.</p>
<p>This is actually why, sorry, I&rsquo;m jumping over the place,</p>
<p>but this is why things like a belt work very well</p>
<p>for actually increasing abdominal strength.</p>
<p>So a misconception out there is if you wear like a belt</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re lifting, then the belt kind of does</p>
<p>all the work for you and your abs get weaker.</p>
<p>That can happen, but the exact opposite can happen as well.</p>
<p>So if you take a belt, for example,</p>
<p>and you cinch it down really tight,</p>
<p>and then you just completely disregard your midsection,</p>
<p>you will see a loss of strength in your midsection</p>
<p>because now the belt is doing the work.</p>
<p>But if you put the belt on just a little bit,</p>
<p>kind of tight to where you get some sensory feedback,</p>
<p>and you think about using that belt</p>
<p>as a way to activate the core musculature,</p>
<p>you will actually see a higher,</p>
<p>if we look at like EMG activation,</p>
<p>the core muscles would be activated higher</p>
<p>to a greater extent than when the belt is off.</p>
<p>Because of proprioceptive feedback.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>And for those that are wondering</p>
<p>what proprioceptive feedback is,</p>
<p>proprioceptive feedback is that there are nerves</p>
<p>that extend out to the muscles</p>
<p>that control muscle contractions,</p>
<p>but then there are sensory inputs from the skin and muscle</p>
<p>that go back into the nervous system</p>
<p>and those work in concert,</p>
<p>and that feedback is proprioceptive.</p>
<p>I think it literally translates to a knowledge</p>
<p>of where one&rsquo;s limbs are and what&rsquo;s happening on those.</p>
<p>In space, yep.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen, I don&rsquo;t have a training partner,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve seen in gyms where someone will be training</p>
<p>and someone will tap the muscle</p>
<p>of the person who&rsquo;s doing the work in order to,</p>
<p>this is consensual tapping of other people&rsquo;s muscles,</p>
<p>not walking around touching people&rsquo;s muscles, please,</p>
<p>that to provide that proprioceptive feedback</p>
<p>so that the person doing the exercises</p>
<p>becomes more aware of the muscle</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re supposed to be training.</p>
<p>And it seems that that&rsquo;s probably an effective practice.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you two examples.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go to the back with that pulling movement,</p>
<p>but then I&rsquo;ll stay on the belt really quickly.</p>
<p>So a very easy example that you can do right now,</p>
<p>listening, and I learned this from Brian McKenzie,</p>
<p>our mutual friend, right?</p>
<p>So if you take your hands and open them up,</p>
<p>like you make an L with both your hands,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll take those and put them around your waist,</p>
<p>just above your hip bones.</p>
<p>Now, what I want you to do is press out as hard as you can</p>
<p>on your hands with your core.</p>
<p>And you can feel a lot of core activation.</p>
<p>And most people think core activation</p>
<p>is the front of your stomach, right?</p>
<p>Your six pack.</p>
<p>What you need to do is create a cylinder around your back.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the front, it&rsquo;s the side, and it&rsquo;s the back.</p>
<p>So if you take your two fingers, point them.</p>
<p>Now put them just outside your belly button.</p>
<p>Can you move your fingers by just moving your ab muscles?</p>
<p>90% of people can do yes.</p>
<p>Same exact thing.</p>
<p>Now go to that same position just above</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called your ASIS,</p>
<p>so your anterior superior iliac spine,</p>
<p>right up that front of your hip bone, right in the front.</p>
<p>Can you now move?</p>
<p>Great, 50% of people are not gonna get any movement there.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Take your thumb and go right above your PSIS.</p>
<p>My what?</p>
<p>PSIS, posterior superior iliac spine, right?</p>
<p>Now, can you move?</p>
<p>Most likely no.</p>
<p>Sort of if I do a mini low back extension.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t, just with your core musculature.</p>
<p>Barely.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Maybe it makes it.</p>
<p>90% of people can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t perform that contraction,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t stabilize your spine.</p>
<p>So only way to get stabilization in your spine</p>
<p>is then to go through hyperextension.</p>
<p>And now that&rsquo;s a compression strategy</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re putting on your spine,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s better than rounding your back,</p>
<p>like going forward,</p>
<p>but overextension is not great either.</p>
<p>So you wanna be able to flex the musculature</p>
<p>in a cylindric fashion so you have control.</p>
<p>So if you go back to our very first things</p>
<p>and with your hands open,</p>
<p>and you put them right here,</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re like, I can&rsquo;t get activation,</p>
<p>if you pay attention to your thumb, right?</p>
<p>Now just move your thumb.</p>
<p>And now you see activation back there, right?</p>
<p>Boom.</p>
<p>So just imagine turning that on just a little bit.</p>
<p>And now notice how I can do this, by the way,</p>
<p>at the same time I&rsquo;m talking.</p>
<p>If you have to go,</p>
<p>huh, huh, huh,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have control, right?</p>
<p>So you have to be able to separate breath from brace.</p>
<p>So now if I can put myself in a position,</p>
<p>and Kelly Starrett has always said 20%,</p>
<p>give me 20% activation here.</p>
<p>And now I can squat, I can hinge, I can jump.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to be locked down to 100% scream</p>
<p>to be able to brace my spine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be ineffective and wasteful.</p>
<p>I wanna be here.</p>
<p>Well, the belt provides that proprioceptive feedback</p>
<p>where I can put it on 20%.</p>
<p>And it just is a reminder.</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t press against the belt,</p>
<p>the belt slides and falls down a little bit</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not on super tight.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s on so dang tight, it&rsquo;s doing the work and I forget.</p>
<p>So we just want a little bit of feedback there.</p>
<p>Same thing with your upper back.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re having a difficult time activating</p>
<p>those rhomboids or those lats,</p>
<p>someone can do a simple thing where they take their finger,</p>
<p>put it right between your shoulder blades,</p>
<p>and you just tell them things like,</p>
<p>hey, squeeze my finger, squeeze my finger.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;re doing your bent row or your pull down,</p>
<p>you can touch the lat, you can do just visualization stuff.</p>
<p>So just imagine like a 3D rendering of that muscle group</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re watching that muscle group contract.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very powerful and very effective to do it.</p>
<p>So a touch, a visual, all this stuff can help</p>
<p>get people to activate.</p>
<p>Outside of simple awareness,</p>
<p>typically eccentric overload is a very effective way</p>
<p>for activation of a difficult to target muscle.</p>
<p>So the lowering of the bar or the lowering of the weight.</p>
<p>The movement of the weight away from the body</p>
<p>is not necessarily what&rsquo;s lowering</p>
<p>because that kind of depends on what muscle group</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing, right?</p>
<p>I misspoke, yeah.</p>
<p>Things like a pull-up.</p>
<p>Okay, so if I&rsquo;m going to do a pull-up</p>
<p>and I have poor lat activation,</p>
<p>I can still get the pull-up muscle movement</p>
<p>executed by contraction of the biceps and things like that.</p>
<p>However, to make the movement simpler,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go all the way to the top.</p>
<p>So imagine stepping on a box or something</p>
<p>going all the way to that top of that pull-up position</p>
<p>and starting from there,</p>
<p>and I want you to simply lower it under control.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re just simply breaking the movement down</p>
<p>into smaller pieces that allow you to focus</p>
<p>on the execution more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be great.</p>
<p>Eccentrics are great for strength development,</p>
<p>very good for hypertrophy</p>
<p>and allow you to focus on control.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to bet a huge percentage of you out there</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve like, I&rsquo;ve never had a sore lat.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve done a lot of pull-ups and things like that.</p>
<p>If you do that eccentric only,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll probably wake up the next day going,</p>
<p>oh gosh, I feel it there.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a sign,</p>
<p>even if you didn&rsquo;t feel it in the workout,</p>
<p>but it got a little sore the next day,</p>
<p>keep down that path.</p>
<p>And then eventually you&rsquo;ll be able to do a concentric,</p>
<p>maybe take a break,</p>
<p>maybe do an isometric where you just hold that position</p>
<p>and eventually work that into a progression</p>
<p>where you can do the concentric, eccentric</p>
<p>and isometric portions and get activation.</p>
<p>So that may take you six weeks,</p>
<p>might take you six months,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s generally a pretty good strategy</p>
<p>for learning how to activate a muscle group.</p>
<p>Terrific suggestions.</p>
<p>Is it true that eccentric-emphasized movements</p>
<p>might require a little bit longer recovery</p>
<p>or they lead to more soreness than concentric movements?</p>
<p>Yeah, they typically can,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re also higher force output.</p>
<p>So very good for strength development,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re going to lead on average to more soreness.</p>
<p>So more potential for intracellular disruption</p>
<p>that is going to be associated with pain.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not as much,</p>
<p>people will like to explain muscle soreness</p>
<p>as a result of microtrauma and micro tears in the muscle.</p>
<p>That can happen, but that&rsquo;s not the norm.</p>
<p>Most of the time it is things like disruption of calcium</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to lead to excessive swelling,</p>
<p>excessive pressure,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s going to be then translated as extreme pain.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s probably explaining more muscle soreness</p>
<p>than actually microtrauma.</p>
<p>Terrific.</p>
<p>I was going to get to breathing later,</p>
<p>but maybe just for now,</p>
<p>if we can do a brief little foray into breathing</p>
<p>as it relates to weight training.</p>
<p>Is there a prescriptive for how to breathe</p>
<p>during resistance training?</p>
<p>Here I&rsquo;m thinking with weights,</p>
<p>not necessarily body weight only movements,</p>
<p>although I suppose it could be,</p>
<p>that applies 75% of the time to 75% of the people.</p>
<p>What I was taught,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m hoping you&rsquo;re going to tell me this was wrong,</p>
<p>because then there might be more benefits awaiting me,</p>
<p>is that I should exhale on the effort</p>
<p>and inhale on the lesser effort portion of an exercise.</p>
<p>Is that true?</p>
<p>Is there a better way to breathe?</p>
<p>There is a better way to think about it.</p>
<p>So number one, if you can breathe and brace,</p>
<p>then this conversation goes away.</p>
<p>So if you can maintain intramuscular,</p>
<p>intra-abdominal pressure while breathing,</p>
<p>then I don&rsquo;t really care when you breathe.</p>
<p>Very challenging to do at very heavy weights.</p>
<p>If we flag this on two areas of a paradigm,</p>
<p>paradigm one over here, you&rsquo;re going to do a set of 30,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to do front squats</p>
<p>where a barbell is sitting on your throat.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t take a breath,</p>
<p>this is going to end one way and one way only,</p>
<p>you passing out.</p>
<p>Clearly has to be some breathing strategy.</p>
<p>The other end of the spectrum is,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re going to do a vertical jump.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need any amount of breath there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never going to happen, right?</p>
<p>The question is, what about in the middle, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m doing some sort of strength training there.</p>
<p>Well, number one, make sure you&rsquo;re braced,</p>
<p>and then you can get away with less need to worry about it.</p>
<p>In general, a decent strategy is to maintain a breath hold</p>
<p>during the lowering or eccentric</p>
<p>or most dangerous part of the movement,</p>
<p>and then you can exhale on the concentric portion.</p>
<p>So if the bench press is our example,</p>
<p>if you held in, braced, lowered it under control,</p>
<p>and now started the concentric pushing away for it,</p>
<p>and then you wanted to take an expiration</p>
<p>during the last half of the concentric portion,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an okay strategy.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to do a single rep,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to worry about it.</p>
<p>You can just avoid or omit breathing entirely.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be just fine.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing more than that,</p>
<p>especially three to four to five to seven, eight,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to have some breathing strategy.</p>
<p>A very common one is probably every third breath.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do like,</p>
<p>exhale on the third, reset, re-breathe, something like that.</p>
<p>If you feel like you need to breathe after every one,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s okay, but it&rsquo;s going to get wasteful</p>
<p>because you have to take time in between reps</p>
<p>of sitting there.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a squat, that&rsquo;s different versus a deadlift</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re resting at the bottom.</p>
<p>So there is a little bit of game here.</p>
<p>So in general though, is that 75, 75,</p>
<p>kind of really thrown out, you threw out.</p>
<p>Breathe in, do the lowering, and exhale on the out</p>
<p>if you have to.</p>
<p>Less reps, don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>More reps, then you need to come up</p>
<p>with some sort of breathing strategy.</p>
<p>How about breathing in between sets</p>
<p>and maybe even after the workout?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is something I think a lot of people overlook.</p>
<p>And because it is the case that recovery has to do</p>
<p>both with the specific activation to muscles</p>
<p>and the nervous system,</p>
<p>but also the attacks on the nervous system</p>
<p>can also take place between sets.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re really getting into it,</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re really geared up between sets</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got adrenaline as high in between sets</p>
<p>or close to it as you are during your sets,</p>
<p>you can imagine that the recovery would take longer</p>
<p>or at least that you&rsquo;re not spending adrenaline</p>
<p>in the most efficient way if there is such a thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, fair.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to see any athlete that I work with</p>
<p>just breathe in between.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s in between innings or in between rounds,</p>
<p>every single one of them is going to go back,</p>
<p>sit in the stool, and they&rsquo;re going to immediately</p>
<p>be into a breathing routine.</p>
<p>A very intentional one.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a little bit different for every athlete,</p>
<p>depending on the sport.</p>
<p>Even a PGA golfer, there&rsquo;s going to be a,</p>
<p>we just hit our ball, we&rsquo;re moving to the next one,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to go into a breathing strategy.</p>
<p>Every one of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge area of potential benefit and consequence</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re just ignoring it.</p>
<p>In general, we want to do any sort of calming breath.</p>
<p>We want to restore.</p>
<p>It depends on if the, it depends on what we&rsquo;re combating.</p>
<p>Are we combating low oxygen or high CO2?</p>
<p>That strategy is going to be a little bit different.</p>
<p>But in general, that is a huge time opportunity</p>
<p>to get better.</p>
<p>In fact, people can go back and listen to some</p>
<p>of your earlier episodes where you talked about,</p>
<p>or you have spoken about, I think, on this show,</p>
<p>when neuroplasticity works.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re losing that opportunity post-exercise,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re leaving gains on the table, if you will.</p>
<p>So not only are you going to see everything</p>
<p>the athletes that I work with mostly</p>
<p>have a breathing strategy in competition,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not going to just finish a workout,</p>
<p>high five, drink water, and walk out of the gym.</p>
<p>There will be a down regulation strategy</p>
<p>that is heavily involved with some sort of light control</p>
<p>as well as breath control.</p>
<p>The individual prescription on that,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a ton of variation with what you can do.</p>
<p>The easiest thing is do something that calms you down.</p>
<p>Most likely, that&rsquo;s going to be moved towards</p>
<p>as much nasal breathing as you can possibly do.</p>
<p>And a really easy rule of thumb is a double exhale length</p>
<p>relative to inhale.</p>
<p>So if you need to take a four-second inhale,</p>
<p>double that time and breathe out for eight seconds.</p>
<p>A box breathing is fine, so equal inhale,</p>
<p>equal hold, equal exhale, equal hold.</p>
<p>So four-second inhale for second hold, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>A triangle is fine too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of ways you can get really complicated,</p>
<p>like what Brian McKenzie will do and Rob,</p>
<p>and those guys have, you can get all kinds of systems</p>
<p>for inhale, exhale control, and it can be optimized,</p>
<p>but some strategy of calm.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to almost always put you on your back or close,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re going to cover light.</p>
<p>We can do some, like we&rsquo;ve done actually</p>
<p>a number of musical interventions as well,</p>
<p>but you can as simple as sit down in a locker room</p>
<p>if you have to and just breathe for five minutes.</p>
<p>That alone is going to be productive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re breathing in the locker room for five minutes,</p>
<p>I suggest closing your eyes or you get some funny looks.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll still get funny looks,</p>
<p>but you won&rsquo;t see people looking at you.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>I love this, and I started doing this</p>
<p>because you and Brian McKenzie informed me about this,</p>
<p>and it completely changed the rate of recovery for me.</p>
<p>I realized that I was leaving workouts,</p>
<p>both endurance workouts</p>
<p>and strength hypertrophy workouts, feeling great,</p>
<p>but looking at my phone,</p>
<p>getting right into email and meetings,</p>
<p>not concentrating on my breathing,</p>
<p>and all I did was to introduce, on your recommendation,</p>
<p>a five-minute down regulation.</p>
<p>Exhale-emphasized breathing, a bunch of different varieties,</p>
<p>physiological size, box breathing,</p>
<p>exhale-emphasized twice as long as the inhale component</p>
<p>for five minutes, and I noticed two things.</p>
<p>One, I recovered more quickly, workout to workout,</p>
<p>no question about it.</p>
<p>The numbers told me that,</p>
<p>and the other is that I used to have this dip in energy</p>
<p>that would occur three or four hours after a hard workout,</p>
<p>and I always thought that had to do with the fact</p>
<p>that I had generally eaten a meal</p>
<p>at some point post-workout.</p>
<p>Turns out it wasn&rsquo;t the meal at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that adrenaline ramp up during the workouts.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t clamping that at the end,</p>
<p>and so I think eventually it just crashed,</p>
<p>and then three or four hours later,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having a hard time even reading</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s on the screen of my computer,</p>
<p>thinking maybe it&rsquo;s the screen,</p>
<p>maybe it was what I ate for lunch.</p>
<p>Turns out the down regulations allowed me</p>
<p>to work through the afternoon with no issues whatsoever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really been quite powerful,</p>
<p>and so I&rsquo;m grateful to you for that,</p>
<p>and I think this is something that I think 98% of people</p>
<p>are not doing, and it&rsquo;s only five minutes.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t even have to do five.</p>
<p>Give me three.</p>
<p>If you really have to push it, give me three,</p>
<p>and you can even do this, you can save time.</p>
<p>You can do this in the shower if you have to.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re done, you&rsquo;re finished,</p>
<p>drink of water, whatever it has to be,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re getting in a shower, getting ready.</p>
<p>Just give me three minutes in the shower.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not ideal, but as little as that,</p>
<p>it can pay huge dividends.</p>
<p>You need some sort of internal signal</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re safe.</p>
<p>Throttle down here, we&rsquo;re gonna move on.</p>
<p>That has to happen.</p>
<p>I could go on and on here,</p>
<p>but I think we&rsquo;re making the same point</p>
<p>kind of over and over again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big deal, and do it.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you&rsquo;re saving energy.</p>
<p>I mean, the energy here is neural energy.</p>
<p>I think fighters do this,</p>
<p>good fighters learn to do this between rounds.</p>
<p>Sprinters learn to do this between events.</p>
<p>I think humans should learn how to do this</p>
<p>between any sort of interval-type activity,</p>
<p>including work, social engagement.</p>
<p>I mean, this is such a powerful tool.</p>
<p>Do this for one minute after every important,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s an individual high volatile interaction,</p>
<p>or if you just did a nice 45-minute sprint to work</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re deep into it or whatever, fine.</p>
<p>Just give me one minute.</p>
<p>Set your alarm, just one minute,</p>
<p>and that also will pay dividends.</p>
<p>I love it, and as I said,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s made a outsized positive difference on my training,</p>
<p>but also activities outside my training,</p>
<p>which is, for me, I&rsquo;m not a professional athlete.</p>
<p>I train for health because I enjoy it,</p>
<p>but when a really hard workout starts to interfere</p>
<p>with the ability to do the other things in life,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a good situation.</p>
<p>So this is really terrific.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more in each of those categories</p>
<p>of strength and hypertrophy,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve given us a tremendous amount</p>
<p>of valuable information there.</p>
<p>Maybe now would be a good time to shift to endurance,</p>
<p>and of the four types of endurance,</p>
<p>and maybe you could remind us what those are,</p>
<p>what do you think are the two</p>
<p>that most people are seeking or pursuing</p>
<p>in terms of health and aesthetics, right?</p>
<p>I realize that we probably have athletes out there as well,</p>
<p>but when I think health and aesthetics,</p>
<p>I think, okay, the ability to do sustained endurance,</p>
<p>30-plus minutes of some ongoing activity,</p>
<p>how does one maximize that work?</p>
<p>What are the modifiable variables?</p>
<p>And then maybe you could tell us</p>
<p>what the other major category is</p>
<p>that people ought to have in their kit.</p>
<p>Okay, so starting off with exercise choice.</p>
<p>One thing, as soon as we cross into the endurance world,</p>
<p>and this is true for all four of those categories,</p>
<p>exercise choice needs to be very concerned</p>
<p>with eccentric landing.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t need to avoid it,</p>
<p>but you need to recognize it relative</p>
<p>or compare it against those other strength and speed ones.</p>
<p>The volume is low on those ones,</p>
<p>so if you have some eccentric absorption, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>But as we sort of talked about five minutes ago,</p>
<p>more eccentric means greater chance</p>
<p>of muscle damage, soreness.</p>
<p>So if you take something and magnify it across 30 minutes</p>
<p>or even five minutes, but a maximal exertion,</p>
<p>you have a recipe for blowing up.</p>
<p>You can imagine, I haven&rsquo;t run in forever,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve listened to this Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m, okay, I&rsquo;m gonna get into my zone two training,</p>
<p>whatever it is, whatever, and I start jogging,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do, you know, I remember when I was,</p>
<p>I used to be able to do 25,</p>
<p>and you just do a 25-minute jog.</p>
<p>The amount of eccentric landing that just occurred</p>
<p>on every single step, because you&rsquo;re never,</p>
<p>with running, even slow running,</p>
<p>you never have two feet on the ground at the same time.</p>
<p>So it is a one-foot land, one-foot land,</p>
<p>your entire body mass plus gravity</p>
<p>onto one leg at a time, repeated now hundreds of times.</p>
<p>That eccentric landing is gonna cause tremendous soreness.</p>
<p>Your quads are gonna go,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably gonna get shin splints,</p>
<p>which is what this is,</p>
<p>those are entirely caused by eccentric landing,</p>
<p>and when the tissue is not ready to tolerate that.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not landing correctly,</p>
<p>this is when knee pain happens,</p>
<p>back pain, shoulder, neck pain,</p>
<p>because of movement compensation.</p>
<p>So anytime we start pressing to fatigue,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s be very concerned with there.</p>
<p>So my initial recommendation is,</p>
<p>start with activities, exercise choice-wise,</p>
<p>that are mostly concentric-based.</p>
<p>So think about a cycle.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re riding on a bike, you&rsquo;re pushing the pedal,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re never landing and absorbing it.</p>
<p>So you could go out and do a 45-minute bike ride,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not gonna get that sore</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s not a lot of eccentric load.</p>
<p>Swimming, similar thing here, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some eccentrics when your hand hits the water,</p>
<p>but fairly minimal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mostly a push, push, push, push, push, no load.</p>
<p>Rowing, similar thing, mostly concentric.</p>
<p>Pushing a sled is fantastic.</p>
<p>Going uphill, running, or even walking hard uphill,</p>
<p>all good, because they&rsquo;re very minimal landing</p>
<p>relative to like running downhill,</p>
<p>which would be a very, very bad idea to start.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re first jumping into these things,</p>
<p>progress your volume for endurance very slowly</p>
<p>if it involves eccentric landing.</p>
<p>A really bad strategy would be to jump in</p>
<p>and do, say, a circuit training class</p>
<p>that involves a bunch of box jumps, right?</p>
<p>This is not a good way</p>
<p>to do your first foray into conditioning.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to get incredibly sore</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re jumping in the landing,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re now looking at three to 10X body weight</p>
<p>in terms of absorption with a single land,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re just jumping.</p>
<p>So be careful of that</p>
<p>in any of those endurance areas of exercise choice.</p>
<p>So what to pick?</p>
<p>Pick the one that you are most technically proficient in,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re going to do it a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a lot of repetitions.</p>
<p>Whatever one you feel the most joy in.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s rowing, great.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s pushing a sled, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>You can do this actually with weights.</p>
<p>This is our preferred way, by the way, with our athletes.</p>
<p>So we might do a 30-minute circuit</p>
<p>where we do a five-minute farmer&rsquo;s carry</p>
<p>with a pretty light weight.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re just going to carry some weights in your hand,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just going to walk up</p>
<p>and down the street for five minutes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to set that down,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re going to do, say, a three-minute plank.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re going to pick that up,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to do body weight squats,</p>
<p>like slowly and just tempoed.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to do a handful of different exercises</p>
<p>so the athletes don&rsquo;t get super bored.</p>
<p>Or a very simple one, if a 30-minute workout,</p>
<p>10 minutes on a treadmill, 10 minutes on a bike,</p>
<p>10 minutes on a rower.</p>
<p>For those of you that are like,</p>
<p>oh my God, I can&rsquo;t do 30 straight minutes of running.</p>
<p>Cool, break it up into three or four different exercises</p>
<p>that are all fairly safe.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how I would do that long-duration piece</p>
<p>for exercise choice.</p>
<p>And then in terms of heart rate during that period,</p>
<p>I mean, how much attention should we pay to this?</p>
<p>The kind of very broad prescriptive</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve thrown out on this podcast a few times</p>
<p>based on my read of the literature</p>
<p>is for most people that are oriented toward health,</p>
<p>including people that are working on size</p>
<p>and strength gains, hypertrophy and strength, of course,</p>
<p>that getting 150 to 180 minutes</p>
<p>of so-called zone two cardio can just barely</p>
<p>have a conversation.</p>
<p>But if one were to push any harder,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just as a generic recommendation</p>
<p>that almost everybody should follow</p>
<p>in order to just keep their cardiovascular system healthy.</p>
<p>But I know there&rsquo;s a lot of nuance there.</p>
<p>And some people would like to be able to run continuously</p>
<p>for an hour at speed, right?</p>
<p>Obviously not sprinting.</p>
<p>But what are some of the finer points</p>
<p>on long-distance endurance?</p>
<p>So how often should one do it?</p>
<p>Okay, frequency, you could do it as daily, right?</p>
<p>Even when doing strength and hypertrophy training?</p>
<p>No question.</p>
<p>Well, that I think is an important point</p>
<p>for people to hear</p>
<p>because a lot of people think</p>
<p>that they are going to greatly diminish</p>
<p>their strength and hypertrophy gains,</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s often called, by doing zone two cardio.</p>
<p>Zone two, you have almost no ability</p>
<p>to block your hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Zone two, within that category,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re talking about conversational pace,</p>
<p>there is very, in fact, there is strong reason</p>
<p>to think that is not going to influence hypertrophy</p>
<p>for the overwhelming majority of people.</p>
<p>It might even help it</p>
<p>by increasing blood flow to the various muscles.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Does it matter, let&rsquo;s say someone&rsquo;s doing primarily</p>
<p>strength and hypertrophy,</p>
<p>their primary goals are strength and hypertrophy,</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re going to do,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to hit that 150 to 180 minutes</p>
<p>of zone two cardio per week,</p>
<p>assuming they&rsquo;re breaking that up</p>
<p>into three or four sessions.</p>
<p>Does it matter if they do it</p>
<p>in the same workout before or after?</p>
<p>Does that matter?</p>
<p>I tend to do, just by way of example for people,</p>
<p>certainly I&rsquo;m just one example,</p>
<p>I tend to do resistance training one day,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;ll do zone two cardio the next day.</p>
<p>I jog because that&rsquo;s the thing I prefer.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;ll do strength hypertrophy training the next day</p>
<p>and then jog for my zone two cardio,</p>
<p>and then I take one full day off a week.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never actually done the zone two cardio</p>
<p>on the same day,</p>
<p>but were I to do it on the same day,</p>
<p>would it matter if I did it before</p>
<p>or after my strength and hypertrophy training?</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be just fine.</p>
<p>Interference effects,</p>
<p>the interference effect is what this is called.</p>
<p>So this is all the way back to 1980,</p>
<p>Bob Hickman&rsquo;s stuff, right?</p>
<p>And he was actually working in a lab with John Halazi,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s one of the fathers of exercise biochemistry.</p>
<p>And sort of the story goes that Hickman came in,</p>
<p>he was a strength training guy,</p>
<p>and Halazi and almost all those initial exercise</p>
<p>physiologists were conditioning folks, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost always swimmers and runners.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why a bulk of the exercise physiology</p>
<p>historically is shaped in that direction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what those scientists were interested in.</p>
<p>So Hickman was there in the lab</p>
<p>and how much of this is myth or not,</p>
<p>who really knows,</p>
<p>but so the story goes.</p>
<p>That this is sort of chipping back and forth</p>
<p>and you know how from a PI to a postdoc</p>
<p>and kind of that razzing works a little bit.</p>
<p>And eventually he was like,</p>
<p>you got to start running with us.</p>
<p>And he was like, you got to start lifting with me</p>
<p>and kind of goes back and forth.</p>
<p>Well, you know who wins in that equation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the postdoc, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the PI gets in and says,</p>
<p>Hickman says, okay, fine.</p>
<p>So he starts running with Halazi</p>
<p>and then eventually starts to realize I&rsquo;m getting weak.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m losing strength and like, I just can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I think it was his bench press specifically</p>
<p>was going down or maybe his squat.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>Who knows if it&rsquo;s even real, but point is.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s going along.</p>
<p>And so eventually that starts to create</p>
<p>a little bit of animosity.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, actually, I don&rsquo;t think this is good for me.</p>
<p>And then blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>And so they did what any good scientists would do</p>
<p>and said, well, let&rsquo;s find out, right?</p>
<p>And so they run a really famous experiment</p>
<p>where he took a group, three groups.</p>
<p>One group did an endurance piece, right?</p>
<p>The steady state cardio.</p>
<p>One group did a strength training piece.</p>
<p>And then the third group did both of those workouts combined</p>
<p>not like a reduction.</p>
<p>So both volumes stacked on top of each other.</p>
<p>And the results are fairly predictable</p>
<p>in terms of the endurance group only</p>
<p>had the greatest increases in VO2 max and endurance markers.</p>
<p>The strength training group had the greatest increases</p>
<p>in muscle hypertrophy.</p>
<p>But where the interesting part was</p>
<p>and where this whole field started was the combined group.</p>
<p>So this is concurrent training is what it&rsquo;s generally called.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re doing concurrent things.</p>
<p>And typically that means hypertrophy and strength</p>
<p>stacked on top of some in steady state endurance.</p>
<p>In the same time frame.</p>
<p>Same workout.</p>
<p>Same two hour block.</p>
<p>Or same like week.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really, it can be kind of all these.</p>
<p>Well, the concurrent group saw the same improvements</p>
<p>in VO2 max as the endurance group.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, well, okay.</p>
<p>So the strength training did not compromise</p>
<p>the endurance adaptations.</p>
<p>However, they saw much lower increases in strength</p>
<p>and hypertrophy.</p>
<p>And so it was, the conclusion was the addition</p>
<p>of endurance work compromised muscle growth</p>
<p>and strength development.</p>
<p>However, the addition of strength training</p>
<p>to your endurance work will not compromise</p>
<p>your endurance gains.</p>
<p>Now that second piece has been shown countless more times.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re an endurance athlete,</p>
<p>adding strength training is almost always</p>
<p>going to be massively beneficial.</p>
<p>Very little chance of detriment.</p>
<p>Or it is why every endurance athlete</p>
<p>is gonna have some sort of strength and power component</p>
<p>to their training.</p>
<p>The controversy though came in the interference effects.</p>
<p>So how much endurance training really blocks</p>
<p>muscular development.</p>
<p>And for years, myself included, was we preached hard.</p>
<p>You know, don&rsquo;t do these two things at the same time.</p>
<p>My friend, my colleague, Kevin Muir</p>
<p>has a really nice review article, Jimmy Bagley.</p>
<p>Those two guys put this thing out.</p>
<p>You can go read that.</p>
<p>Where they cover all these things</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve got some nice figures in there.</p>
<p>But the general answer here is,</p>
<p>interference effect is sort of real,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s probably greatly overblown.</p>
<p>It matters.</p>
<p>So are you talking about a 20 minute jog</p>
<p>at conversation pace?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably doing very little.</p>
<p>With the assumption that,</p>
<p>are you doing an eccentric based exercise like running?</p>
<p>Well, then you&rsquo;re gonna have more of interference effect</p>
<p>than cycling.</p>
<p>That makes a ton of sense if you think about it, right?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your total energy intake?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re eating sufficient calories,</p>
<p>you can still be in an anabolic state.</p>
<p>If the addition of extra energy expenditure,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all it really is, mark the cardio,</p>
<p>put you in a negative energy state,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna become very difficult to go through anabolism.</p>
<p>So those things matter.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re talking about doing like,</p>
<p>running a few laps around the track as a warmup,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s not interference effect.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re really talking about is a big volume</p>
<p>performed consistently.</p>
<p>Now, after Hickman came out with this paper in 1980,</p>
<p>people followed it up in the 90s and 2000s with mechanism.</p>
<p>And we started to look and see,</p>
<p>we started to see,</p>
<p>hey, there&rsquo;s this cell signaling pathway</p>
<p>that goes down called mTOR</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what leads to muscle growth.</p>
<p>And then on the other side of that equation,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a thing called AMPK,</p>
<p>which is more associated with mitochondrial biogenesis</p>
<p>and endurance.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this little molecule in between,</p>
<p>at the time, most people would point to TSC2.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out AMPK activation is fine.</p>
<p>If you activate mTOR, there&rsquo;s no bearing on AMPK,</p>
<p>but if you activate AMPK,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna activate TSC2, which inhibited mTOR.</p>
<p>And so it was like, we had practical outcome,</p>
<p>i.e., Hickman, you&rsquo;re gonna get weaker.</p>
<p>Now we had mechanism.</p>
<p>So that story became very, very strong</p>
<p>that this interference effect,</p>
<p>and this is how science should work, right?</p>
<p>When you see mechanism match up</p>
<p>with practical human outcome,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a strong thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you want, yep.</p>
<p>It was still wrong though.</p>
<p>It just took more science, right?</p>
<p>And this is why we always have to give science a bit of time</p>
<p>and you have to be willing to follow, right?</p>
<p>And again, even me in the field</p>
<p>who has a practitioner background in science,</p>
<p>I felt very strongly, this is a big problem.</p>
<p>It just didn&rsquo;t turn out to be the case.</p>
<p>Enough studies came out where I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>okay, it&rsquo;s probably not that big a deal</p>
<p>unless the movement is heavily eccentric-based,</p>
<p>the volume is very high,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to maximize muscle growth,</p>
<p>and energy is not controlled.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s not all the case,</p>
<p>interference effect is probably</p>
<p>not something most people should worry about.</p>
<p>When you, especially when you compare that</p>
<p>against the well-roundedness that you need</p>
<p>for total physiological health, probably not a big deal.</p>
<p>Very reassuring for me to hear</p>
<p>because I do enjoy lifting weights</p>
<p>and I really enjoy running and I love running outside.</p>
<p>I believe I used to experience the interference effect</p>
<p>when I used to do a very long run on Sundays.</p>
<p>I would just go out for two hours or something like that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that I ate enough or who knows.</p>
<p>I always feel like I eat enough or more.</p>
<p>I love to eat.</p>
<p>But that long Sunday run always made it hard</p>
<p>for me to make progressive gains in strength</p>
<p>and hypertrophy in the gym.</p>
<p>Whereas when I cut that to 30 minutes,</p>
<p>three or four times a week,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any interference effect at all.</p>
<p>Probably very real.</p>
<p>And I haven&rsquo;t trained specifically for endurance</p>
<p>in a very long time,</p>
<p>so I haven&rsquo;t experienced the non-interference effect,</p>
<p>which as you said before,</p>
<p>most if not all endurance athletes probably are</p>
<p>or at least should be doing some sort of strength work</p>
<p>just to keep the undercarriage strong as I think.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a bunch of reasons.</p>
<p>So what are some protocols that people could explore</p>
<p>for continuous endurance training?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve thrown out this 150 to 180 minute</p>
<p>zone two cardio,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s really the kind of kindergarten of endurance.</p>
<p>And there I&rsquo;m probably being generous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably the nursery school of endurance</p>
<p>that everyone should do.</p>
<p>What sorts of other protocols?</p>
<p>I realize that can be very goal-directed,</p>
<p>but is it unreasonable, for instance,</p>
<p>for somebody to do four hours of continuous endurance</p>
<p>training with intervals in there as well</p>
<p>to get it kind of all around heart health</p>
<p>and the ability to go long distances?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ll answer this two ways.</p>
<p>The very first one,</p>
<p>to tackle the long duration endurance</p>
<p>is how I refer to it.</p>
<p>You asked really about heart rate zones.</p>
<p>To me, that&rsquo;s almost totally irrelevant.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re moving, you&rsquo;re moving.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the functional piece here.</p>
<p>If you want to push it and go at a non-conversational pace,</p>
<p>that has tremendous health benefits.</p>
<p>If you want to do it a little bit slower, fine.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re at the pace where you can have a conversation,</p>
<p>to me, I don&rsquo;t even count that as exercise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a pejorative, by the way.</p>
<p>That is just general physical movement.</p>
<p>It is extraordinarily clear.</p>
<p>You need a lot of that.</p>
<p>You need a lot more of that than we get.</p>
<p>You can do this in a couple of efficient ways.</p>
<p>Just taking your phone calls moving.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a 30-minute call every day,</p>
<p>or most days of the week,</p>
<p>and you can do that while moving,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve checked not that whole box,</p>
<p>but a pretty good chunk of it.</p>
<p>And that could even be done inside.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>Pacing back and forth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big pacer.</p>
<p>Yeah, me too.</p>
<p>You probably saw me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to walk up and down all over the place.</p>
<p>Most of the time when I&rsquo;m in my office working,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m shadowboxing, I&rsquo;m doing air squats.</p>
<p>Not even intentionally, I&rsquo;m just like.</p>
<p>Do you have one of those treadmills under the desk?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, but every lab I ever came through, somebody did.</p>
<p>We did an episode on workspace optimization,</p>
<p>and the data on those treadmills are pretty interesting.</p>
<p>They definitely increase alertness,</p>
<p>which for obvious reasons,</p>
<p>even a little bit of movement is going to generate</p>
<p>a little bit of adrenaline.</p>
<p>So pacing around, moving, taking calls, moving,</p>
<p>getting walks when you can.</p>
<p>And then in terms of building endurance,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say somebody wants to quote unquote</p>
<p>get into better shape.</p>
<p>They already may or may not already have some size</p>
<p>and strength that they&rsquo;re happy with,</p>
<p>and they just want to get in,</p>
<p>they want to improve their health.</p>
<p>So when does that 150, 180,</p>
<p>this thing tick over into a different protocol?</p>
<p>Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>So I think the way that I can outline a weekly schedule,</p>
<p>just as a conceptual model here,</p>
<p>that long duration stuff is not even counting,</p>
<p>as I mentioned, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a, this is what you need to do as a human,</p>
<p>moving forward.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t improved.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re extremely unfit,</p>
<p>you may see some changes in cardiovascular health there,</p>
<p>but for the most part,</p>
<p>this is just knocking out the general physical practice</p>
<p>you need to be higher functioning.</p>
<p>So whatever that time domain is, I don&rsquo;t really care.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a huge concern of mine.</p>
<p>What I think you need to hit are these nodes.</p>
<p>You need to do something once a week</p>
<p>that gets you to a maximum heart rate.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t have to literally mean max, but close.</p>
<p>So this means really sucking for air?</p>
<p>Really, like as high as you can possibly get.</p>
<p>You can wear a heart rate monitor if you want,</p>
<p>but maximum heart rate,</p>
<p>the rough equation we say is 220 minus your age.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re 40 years old,</p>
<p>your maximum heart rate</p>
<p>is probably about 180 beats per minute.</p>
<p>Now I can tell you flat out right now,</p>
<p>my max heart rate is close to 210,</p>
<p>which means I&rsquo;m 10 years old.</p>
<p>So take that number with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>I have had a bunch of professional athletes</p>
<p>who are in their 20s and their max heart rate&rsquo;s 175,</p>
<p>and they are in way better shape than I am.</p>
<p>So maximum heart rate is not a good proxy</p>
<p>for physical fitness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a rough number.</p>
<p>An easy way to do it is if you have a heart rate monitor,</p>
<p>anything like that,</p>
<p>do the hardest workout you can possibly do,</p>
<p>see what the highest number you get as,</p>
<p>and assume that&rsquo;s close.</p>
<p>If you want to just start at 220 minus your age,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fine too.</p>
<p>Do something though where you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>yep, this is death.</p>
<p>This is really, really challenging.</p>
<p>For how long?</p>
<p>However long that takes you.</p>
<p>That can be a 30 second go on an aerodyne or aerosol bike.</p>
<p>That could be a,</p>
<p>do one of those things where you kind of like sprint,</p>
<p>run as hard as you can during the straightaway on a track</p>
<p>and then walk the corners.</p>
<p>Kind of an old classic back when you and I were kids,</p>
<p>interval training.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t do that anymore?</p>
<p>I guess, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t ever talk about it.</p>
<p>In PE class we had to change,</p>
<p>and if you didn&rsquo;t bring running shoes,</p>
<p>you had to do it barefoot.</p>
<p>Oh, I love it.</p>
<p>I love your teacher.</p>
<p>Yeah, it wasn&rsquo;t a,</p>
<p>our football, basketball, baseball teams weren&rsquo;t that good,</p>
<p>but anything like running cross country,</p>
<p>just because of where I grew up,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re brutal, brutal coaches.</p>
<p>So yeah, they&rsquo;d make all kids do these runs.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it can be in the 30 probably seconds at a minimum.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to get you to a true heart rate max</p>
<p>in shorter than 30 seconds.</p>
<p>You can get to total suck in under 20 seconds,</p>
<p>but getting to a true heart rate max</p>
<p>is probably going to take more than 30 seconds.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t really matter what you want to do.</p>
<p>It can be, again, a sprint uphill.</p>
<p>It could be, well, you&rsquo;re talking,</p>
<p>it could be burpees to death.</p>
<p>You know, like whatever you want to do.</p>
<p>Although those have an eccentric component, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, they do.</p>
<p>No question about it.</p>
<p>But if you did-</p>
<p>Not to actual death, by the way.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If you just did,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do as many burpees as I can for 90 seconds.</p>
<p>It probably won&rsquo;t take you much longer than that</p>
<p>to get to close to-</p>
<p>And is that the whole workout?</p>
<p>Could be.</p>
<p>So once a week, get to max heart rate.</p>
<p>Touch it.</p>
<p>Touch it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the best, but it&rsquo;ll work.</p>
<p>And what are the specific benefits that that provides?</p>
<p>Okay, so earlier in our chat,</p>
<p>we outlined the rule of specificity,</p>
<p>specific adaptation to imposed demand.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re never getting to that high of a pace,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re never, it would be like trying to get stronger,</p>
<p>but only going to 60%.</p>
<p>So every cardiovascular adaptation that occurs</p>
<p>with cardiovascular training</p>
<p>is just simply going to get to the top or end by doing this.</p>
<p>So if you just start at the heart itself,</p>
<p>stroke volume increase.</p>
<p>So this is the amount of blood</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kicked out per contraction.</p>
<p>Cardiac output, resting heart rate.</p>
<p>If you go to the endothelial function,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about nitric oxide release,</p>
<p>endothelial health in general,</p>
<p>capillary, mitochondria, all the way down.</p>
<p>Like you just walk through the whole system,</p>
<p>pulmonary exchange to the lungs.</p>
<p>All of those are going to benefit</p>
<p>by being challenged to their maximum.</p>
<p>They also teach you where your vomit reflex is.</p>
<p>Yeah, there you go, right?</p>
<p>Stress is what causes adaptation, right?</p>
<p>So if you push your, okay, here&rsquo;s the difference.</p>
<p>If you did 25 minutes of steady state,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not challenging the same thing</p>
<p>as what we just talked about.</p>
<p>The way that I explain this is</p>
<p>if you understand the point of physiological failure,</p>
<p>then you understand the place of adaptation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>So if you and I both go run on a,</p>
<p>we did a VO2 max test.</p>
<p>So classic VO2 max test is going to take eight to 12 minutes</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to look something like this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to get in a treadmill and we&rsquo;re going to run.</p>
<p>And every minute,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to just slightly increase that treadmill,</p>
<p>either the speed or the grade.</p>
<p>Most of the time it&rsquo;s the speed, right?</p>
<p>So we get to a high grade, say 10% grade or something.</p>
<p>And then we go five miles per hour, 5.2, 5.4,</p>
<p>and we just go until you can&rsquo;t go any longer.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s say you and I did that</p>
<p>and we had the same exact timeframe.</p>
<p>And so we both went eight minutes.</p>
<p>The time that you last is not the thing</p>
<p>that we care about, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the volume of oxygen that you breathe out</p>
<p>is what determines it.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say we went with the same time domain</p>
<p>and we had the same VO2 max.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say they were both 50 milliliters</p>
<p>per kilogram per minute,</p>
<p>which is like a okay number,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s nothing to be extremely proud about.</p>
<p>Just because we have the same number</p>
<p>does not mean we have the same point</p>
<p>of physiological failure.</p>
<p>And this matters because it&rsquo;s going to answer</p>
<p>the what do I do about it then question, right?</p>
<p>So if you got off</p>
<p>and I started asking you a series of questions</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>and I basically said, why&rsquo;d you quit?</p>
<p>You know, why did you jump off the treadmill?</p>
<p>Why&rsquo;d you stop?</p>
<p>And you were like, my chest,</p>
<p>like I couldn&rsquo;t catch my breath.</p>
<p>I thought my heart was gonna explode.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>If you ask me and I said, my legs were on fire.</p>
<p>Like I was breathing hard,</p>
<p>but I couldn&rsquo;t take another step.</p>
<p>This is a very rough indicator</p>
<p>of different places of physiological disruption.</p>
<p>Now what I&rsquo;ve seen a lot with my professional athletes,</p>
<p>especially like fighters,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to generally fail on their legs</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t often do a lot of strength training</p>
<p>in their legs.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t do a lot of leg work.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re fighting on their back, literally a lot,</p>
<p>or on top or on their knees.</p>
<p>So their legs tend to give out before there.</p>
<p>Someone who feels in the cardiovascular system,</p>
<p>like say you did a lot of leg training,</p>
<p>typically like an endurance athlete who&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not gonna be their issue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just gonna be,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna reach a heart rate and ventilation threshold</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s they can no longer handle.</p>
<p>If I put you on the exact same training protocols,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna be as effective</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re going to always fail at your legs</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna always fail at their cardiovascular system.</p>
<p>I need to flip that.</p>
<p>I need to put you in a position</p>
<p>to where you can reach a true heart rate</p>
<p>or ventilation challenge</p>
<p>while your legs are still hanging in there or the opposite.</p>
<p>So the training protocol is based on that point of failure.</p>
<p>The adaptation is in the same thing.</p>
<p>So if you are failing because of your legs,</p>
<p>then you might see a greater increase</p>
<p>in the capitalization in your legs.</p>
<p>Relative to somebody else who&rsquo;s failing</p>
<p>in their cardiovascular system,</p>
<p>they may see a greater change</p>
<p>in something on that side of the equation.</p>
<p>So it matters how you&rsquo;re failing at all times.</p>
<p>What I love about this is that it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>sounds like it&rsquo;s like a thermometer</p>
<p>for where one is weak and needs work,</p>
<p>but also provides a stimulus to improve</p>
<p>the very thing that you need.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the trick, right?</p>
<p>So to just get real brass tacks about it,</p>
<p>it would be once a week.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah.</p>
<p>90 seconds near maximum heart rate.</p>
<p>Could I do more?</p>
<p>Could I do five or six of those 90 second bouts?</p>
<p>No question.</p>
<p>You can do, as long as you touch</p>
<p>that max heart rate, I&rsquo;m good, right?</p>
<p>Ideal world, probably four to eight.</p>
<p>In that single session?</p>
<p>Ideal, right?</p>
<p>If that takes you 20 seconds or 90 seconds, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>If you want to do 30 on, 30 off.</p>
<p>You want to do 20 on, 40 off, 40 on, 20 off.</p>
<p>Those numbers don&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>And is there an interference effect of this</p>
<p>on the other sorts of training that we&rsquo;ve talked about?</p>
<p>It actually tends to be complementary.</p>
<p>There is, the evidence available suggests</p>
<p>that this high interval stuff is more likely</p>
<p>to be complementary to hypertrophy training,</p>
<p>probably because of lactate and some other cool things,</p>
<p>which are very beneficial molecules</p>
<p>that people don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>They think it&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a hugely beneficial thing.</p>
<p>It can be interference.</p>
<p>It can provide an interference</p>
<p>if calories are not accounted for,</p>
<p>if rest is not accounted for, and other things.</p>
<p>But in general, it&rsquo;s probably okay.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t add it to your equation</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t need it for maximizing hypertrophy.</p>
<p>But for the person who wants</p>
<p>to just get well-rounded physiology,</p>
<p>yeah, I wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to do these</p>
<p>even in the same session or different sessions.</p>
<p>Terrific.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s done once a week</p>
<p>and the 150 to 180 minutes or so of zone two cardio</p>
<p>is done in the rest of the week,</p>
<p>the person&rsquo;s doing their strength</p>
<p>and hypertrophy training, we would hope,</p>
<p>what other sorts of endurance practices</p>
<p>could one incorporate?</p>
<p>You mentioned muscular endurance,</p>
<p>like the ability, like a wall sit</p>
<p>or the ability to do a plank.</p>
<p>Is that something, is that useful for anything?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Except doing planks and wall sitting?</p>
<p>No, no, it&rsquo;s extraordinarily useful.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hold on muscular endurance.</p>
<p>I want to finish one more thing on this side.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re building this week of endurance,</p>
<p>once a week, hit that number.</p>
<p>If you can do repeated bouts,</p>
<p>you know, we talked four to eight, that&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t muscle the,</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t manage the mental energy every week,</p>
<p>do it every other week.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still very good, right?</p>
<p>Because I get it, like I&rsquo;m a working person too</p>
<p>and sometimes you&rsquo;re just like, I cannot.</p>
<p>Like those workouts feel incredible afterwards,</p>
<p>but man, they are daunting.</p>
<p>If you love this stuff, you could do it four times a week.</p>
<p>If you hate it though, it&rsquo;s not realistic to think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be able to knock this out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to end up doing 70, 80%,</p>
<p>which is not going to get you the benefit.</p>
<p>So just don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>You really have to hit that ceiling.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to get up there, close.</p>
<p>Have someone chase, I always say, you know,</p>
<p>when doing this kind of work, in my mind,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking that I&rsquo;m basically being chased by somebody</p>
<p>with a syringe full of poison.</p>
<p>And while there are other ways out of the situation,</p>
<p>and for the benefit of what we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>the one I&rsquo;m referring to is to just run.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>My motivation is typically, if you just get this done,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re done in a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>Just get it done.</p>
<p>Like don&rsquo;t go here if you&rsquo;re not going to do it.</p>
<p>When you show up, check in, and it&rsquo;s over really quickly.</p>
<p>Breathing down regulation afterwards.</p>
<p>100%, you have to, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge key.</p>
<p>So if you absolutely can&rsquo;t do it, do it every other week.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s twice a month.</p>
<p>Give me twice a month.</p>
<p>It can be done on the road.</p>
<p>It can be done in 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Like do a really good thorough warmup.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t just jump into those, by the way, right away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to be as beneficial.</p>
<p>Really nice, good sweat broke, a really good warmup.</p>
<p>And then give me four minutes of hard work and we&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>Right, get out of there.</p>
<p>If you want to use like a bath or hot thermal stress</p>
<p>to kind of like aid in that warmup process, fine.</p>
<p>Get in the sauna, get in a hot bath, get really hot,</p>
<p>get up there, warm up, knock it out.</p>
<p>Whole thing is 20 minutes plus five minutes breathing.</p>
<p>You got it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to start doing this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so, you got a bike right there.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve got all sorts, every room in the studio</p>
<p>that has a different piece of equipment, it seems.</p>
<p>So I want that once a week, realistically every week</p>
<p>if I have to.</p>
<p>I want that physical activity piece,</p>
<p>call it whatever you want, long duration thing.</p>
<p>Ideally, you&rsquo;ll do as much of that through your nose only.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to be able to do the interval stuff</p>
<p>at nose only, don&rsquo;t even try.</p>
<p>But if you can go that whole 30 minute time</p>
<p>or 20 or 40 minutes, whatever it&rsquo;s going to be,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually a good way to regulate intensity.</p>
<p>So go as hard as you can while still being able</p>
<p>to breathe through your nose only.</p>
<p>If you have to open up your mouth a little bit,</p>
<p>fine, but try to stay there.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;ll see is very quickly,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to increase your work output</p>
<p>while just breathing through your nose,</p>
<p>which has a bunch of other benefits.</p>
<p>The other piece I want is this middle ground,</p>
<p>which is can you sustain hard work for eight to 12,</p>
<p>maybe as little as four minutes?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you four to 12 minutes.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t have to be quite as high as the first one.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to get to heart and max,</p>
<p>but can you get somewhere in the 80% range</p>
<p>and can you hold that for four minutes?</p>
<p>Maybe give me two minutes, two minutes of rest</p>
<p>and do that twice, something like that.</p>
<p>Ideal situation is what a runner would do</p>
<p>is what we&rsquo;ll call mile repeats</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re running four or five minute miles.</p>
<p>Whatever time it takes them to finish,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna rest that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a one to one work to rest ratio.</p>
<p>So a five minute mile, rest five minutes and go again.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably pretty unrealistic for a lot of folks.</p>
<p>Well, the five minute part is unrealistic for most folks.</p>
<p>For me, it would be eight minutes, eight minutes.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Probably something like that.</p>
<p>Well, in your particular case, just do the 800 meter.</p>
<p>So do 800 meters,</p>
<p>do something that takes two to six minutes of work.</p>
<p>It is a lower intensity than the max stuff,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a much higher workload.</p>
<p>That is probably gonna give you,</p>
<p>you might even argue the most cardiovascular benefit</p>
<p>because it is sustained work output.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very critical.</p>
<p>The downside of kind of like that conversational pace,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s physical activity, it&rsquo;s movement,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s blood flow, it&rsquo;s lymphatic drainage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not very cardiovascularly challenging.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just not gonna get an optimal health</p>
<p>from just walking actively.</p>
<p>So two to six minutes of hard work</p>
<p>with then an equivalent amount of rest in between</p>
<p>and then repeat how many times?</p>
<p>Once, if you have to.</p>
<p>If it needs to be one rep,</p>
<p>if it needs to be a six minute thing</p>
<p>and then down regulate, breathe.</p>
<p>Twice, if you can do that.</p>
<p>Six times, eight times, like whatever you can really do.</p>
<p>And you can just take that</p>
<p>as long of a training session as you want or short.</p>
<p>Exercise choice can be whatever you want.</p>
<p>So again, you can do sled pushes</p>
<p>or it could be a kettlebell circuit</p>
<p>or any combination of things where you&rsquo;re just,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re working and you&rsquo;re not giving yourself a break.</p>
<p>You have got to be able to hold on</p>
<p>at a very high waste product production level</p>
<p>as well as a high demand for energy.</p>
<p>And then bring it down.</p>
<p>And breathing during this two to six minutes</p>
<p>of hard output is mainly through the nose</p>
<p>or combination nose and mouth?</p>
<p>Or is that getting too technical?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s probably like I like it,</p>
<p>but you tell me if it&rsquo;s too technical.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna try to maintain nasal only</p>
<p>as much as you can,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re gonna lose it at some point.</p>
<p>You can go through their Brian and Rob&rsquo;s gear system</p>
<p>and learn more.</p>
<p>And then you can kind of see what gear to be in.</p>
<p>If you have to go nose in, mouth out,</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t really care too much, honestly, in that range.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting most of my nasal only stuff at night</p>
<p>and training and everything.</p>
<p>So if you have to open up the throttle there</p>
<p>to get the work done, that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Oh, then we&rsquo;ll actually answer your question,</p>
<p>which was muscular endurance.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go back to that piece.</p>
<p>Muscular endurance is incredibly important</p>
<p>for general maintenance of joint health.</p>
<p>In other words, you have got form follows function, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very classic science-y physiology saying.</p>
<p>Meaning you&rsquo;ve got a couple of different,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch, but to make it easy,</p>
<p>two different types of muscle fibers,</p>
<p>fast twitch and slow twitch.</p>
<p>Fast twitch fibers tend to be,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not always bigger.</p>
<p>They contract with a higher velocity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they are called fast twitch,</p>
<p>but they tend to be more glycolytic and thus fatigable.</p>
<p>Slow twitch tend to be smaller, well, not always.</p>
<p>They are more packed with mitochondria.</p>
<p>They were generally better at burning fat as a fuel,</p>
<p>but contract with lower velocity.</p>
<p>Well, we have these two types</p>
<p>so that we can regulate function more.</p>
<p>You have some muscle groups that we&rsquo;re going to,</p>
<p>sorry, let me go back up a quick second.</p>
<p>Each individual muscle in a human body</p>
<p>has a combination of some amount of fast</p>
<p>and some amount of slow.</p>
<p>That percentage of fast versus slow</p>
<p>differs from muscle to muscle.</p>
<p>So it also differs from person to person.</p>
<p>Easy example is your calf muscle.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s three, but there&rsquo;s two primary muscles in your calf.</p>
<p>One&rsquo;s called the soleus and one&rsquo;s the gastroc.</p>
<p>The gastroc is the one where if you take your toe</p>
<p>and point it towards your face and then flex,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the one that pops out on the medial side,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the one that pops out on the inside.</p>
<p>The soleus is what we call an anti-gravity muscle,</p>
<p>and it is generally about 80% to even 90% slow twitch.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s supposed to be contracted lightly</p>
<p>all the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s supposed to be on permanently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s meant to keep, we call it anti-gravity</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s meant to keep you erect, up and moving.</p>
<p>Your spinal erector is supposed to do this.</p>
<p>Various muscles for postural</p>
<p>are generally slow twitch muscles.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re supposed to be on all times,</p>
<p>not produce fast, not produce force,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t get tired.</p>
<p>The gastroc is the opposite.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not activated very often,</p>
<p>but when it&rsquo;s activated, it&rsquo;s meant for extreme propulsion.</p>
<p>So this gives us the ability to reach up</p>
<p>and scratch our eyeball and also punch somebody, right?</p>
<p>We have to be able to regulate force output,</p>
<p>which is going back to Henneman, right?</p>
<p>Controlling what we use and what we don&rsquo;t use</p>
<p>while also not wasting energy,</p>
<p>which is the downside of activating</p>
<p>a big threshold motor neuron</p>
<p>is it requires a ton of energy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a more efficient mode of energy,</p>
<p>but the total amount is really, really high.</p>
<p>So muscular endurance is going to</p>
<p>help those slow twitch muscle fibers</p>
<p>and slow twitch predominant muscles</p>
<p>maintain their working job.</p>
<p>So if you lose your muscular endurance ability</p>
<p>in your spinal erectors or your calf,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna start slumping into bad positions.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be putting joints in a movement pattern</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not going to be the most happy with.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s more about than being able</p>
<p>to just maintain a two minute wall squat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about maintaining joint integrity</p>
<p>and allowing that musculature to not fatigue</p>
<p>when you ask it to do heavy and fast.</p>
<p>So what I mean by that is you&rsquo;ve got a whole combination</p>
<p>of muscles in your shoulder.</p>
<p>And we will generally call these</p>
<p>like the rotator cuff muscles.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s imagine those slow twitch postural</p>
<p>muscles get fatigued</p>
<p>and they start to lose contractile tension.</p>
<p>And then you go to do something heavy or fast</p>
<p>or an emergency situation.</p>
<p>Those are already pre-fatigued.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna rely more upon the fast twitch muscle fibers</p>
<p>which are there less for postural integrity.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re likely to get out of position.</p>
<p>And this is a whole recipe of like,</p>
<p>God, why is my shoulder just hurting?</p>
<p>God, my back.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very often a case of the slow twitch fibers</p>
<p>and the slow twitch muscle groups</p>
<p>losing muscular endurance.</p>
<p>So you need to build that back up</p>
<p>so that they can control and hold the joint in the position</p>
<p>so the fast twitch fibers can then contract with force.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping that what I&rsquo;m gonna say next</p>
<p>meets what you said accurately.</p>
<p>My experience is that getting injured,</p>
<p>lifting weights or even doing housework or yard work</p>
<p>almost always happens when I&rsquo;m not paying attention,</p>
<p>fatigued, that&rsquo;s kind of obvious,</p>
<p>but also getting in position to initiate a movement,</p>
<p>setting down a weight or lifting weights off the rack</p>
<p>or picking up dumbbells.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s almost always when I seem to activate</p>
<p>this lower back thing that happens every six or eight months</p>
<p>and what you&rsquo;re saying, if I understand correctly,</p>
<p>is that this muscular endurance from wall sits or planks</p>
<p>or things of that sort,</p>
<p>maybe you could give us a few other examples of these,</p>
<p>can help us because they actually prepare the system</p>
<p>to do what we normally think of as the more intense work.</p>
<p>So it sounds like it&rsquo;s really the architecture of the body</p>
<p>that includes nerves and muscles and everything else,</p>
<p>of course, that lets the limbs</p>
<p>and other kind of action end of the body do its best work.</p>
<p>Is that a good way to-</p>
<p>Yeah, let it express its own power and force.</p>
<p>Yep, we&rsquo;ve actually landed on one of my final laws</p>
<p>of strength and conditioning,</p>
<p>which is similar to what I said earlier, right?</p>
<p>So I said, exercises do not determine adaptations.</p>
<p>Application determines adaptation.</p>
<p>So it sounds similar, but it&rsquo;s quite different.</p>
<p>There are no good or bad exercises.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only good or bad application.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a great example of that, right?</p>
<p>So you do not get hurt deadlifting</p>
<p>because deadlifts are dangerous.</p>
<p>You only get hurt deadlifting</p>
<p>because you either got in bad position,</p>
<p>you got in bad position</p>
<p>because you either started in bad position,</p>
<p>which is one of the things you just said,</p>
<p>or you ended up in bad position.</p>
<p>You did too much volume, you did too much intensity,</p>
<p>or you did too much complexity.</p>
<p>Those last three things all hurt you</p>
<p>because they result in the first one,</p>
<p>which is out of position.</p>
<p>Or another way to think about this</p>
<p>is if it&rsquo;s not a visible change in position</p>
<p>is stress got put into a part of the system</p>
<p>that should not absorb that much stress.</p>
<p>So you did too much of it, you did it too heavy,</p>
<p>you got fatigued, and so you broke position.</p>
<p>You got too heavy, so you broke position.</p>
<p>You made the exercise too complex,</p>
<p>you put too many moving parts in it,</p>
<p>you put too many joints in it, and you got out of position.</p>
<p>You did that too many times over time.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ve led to either an acute injury,</p>
<p>bam, back pops and you fall on the floor,</p>
<p>or just like, man, this thing is hurting over time.</p>
<p>All these are the results of the same thing.</p>
<p>So you cannot ever blame the exercise</p>
<p>for causing the problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always either the user or the coach.</p>
<p>You programmed way too much here</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t handle that position,</p>
<p>or you yourself went into it too much.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re getting these little tweaks</p>
<p>and problems going on,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve made an error in one of those things.</p>
<p>So simply back off.</p>
<p>Reduce the complexity, right?</p>
<p>Give yourself more stability, less moving parts.</p>
<p>Do less volume, do less intensity.</p>
<p>In fact, if you look at the people</p>
<p>from the physical therapy world</p>
<p>in terms of the pain literature,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very clear that just stopping a movement</p>
<p>is very rarely going to work.</p>
<p>What you wanna do is back off all the way down</p>
<p>to just below that threshold of that&rsquo;s what aggravates it,</p>
<p>and you wanna train right there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna allow you to do two things.</p>
<p>Number one, tissue tolerance,</p>
<p>and then number two, desensitization.</p>
<p>A lot of pain stuff,</p>
<p>and you could probably speak a lot about this,</p>
<p>is, especially with things like low back pain,</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s not necessarily often much damage there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of hypersensitization</p>
<p>of just pain signal, pain signal.</p>
<p>Omitting the movement entirely</p>
<p>does not get that signal to go away.</p>
<p>You need to train just below that signal</p>
<p>and desensitize it.</p>
<p>So you wanna make sure that the muscular endurance</p>
<p>allows you, you&rsquo;re just putting volume</p>
<p>right below where you start to get a tweak.</p>
<p>And it is beautifully effective for that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve experienced this right side lower back pain for years,</p>
<p>sometimes shooting down the hip.</p>
<p>The two things that really helped</p>
<p>were doing anterior tib work.</p>
<p>So hats off to Knees Over Toes guy, Ben Patrick,</p>
<p>who has created a lot of popularity around tib work.</p>
<p>But I-</p>
<p>Turns out, joints, full range of motion,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a better spot.</p>
<p>Yeah, something about stabilizing</p>
<p>the stuff from the knee down helped my back,</p>
<p>and then also some neck work.</p>
<p>And friends of mine are always teasing me</p>
<p>that my gym is filled with the most bizarre equipment.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t look like any other gym.</p>
<p>A lot of it is just designed to keep me healthy</p>
<p>and still training.</p>
<p>But I love this idea of getting right below</p>
<p>the threshold of pain activation</p>
<p>and not simply going into complete non-action</p>
<p>or just taking complete rest</p>
<p>because that actually can be detrimental.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to talk about a few items</p>
<p>that support training of all kinds</p>
<p>and where there&rsquo;s a lot of confusion</p>
<p>and indeed misconception and mystery.</p>
<p>And just get your take on these.</p>
<p>And I just want to acknowledge at the outset</p>
<p>that for some of these, there&rsquo;s a lot of science.</p>
<p>For some of them, there&rsquo;s less science,</p>
<p>but there certainly is a lot of experience in your camp.</p>
<p>And those categories are cold, heat, and hydration.</p>
<p>Because obviously, whether or not you&rsquo;re a runner,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re strength training,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a human being, you need to hydrate.</p>
<p>But in terms of work output and physical work output,</p>
<p>maybe even cognitive work output,</p>
<p>maybe we&rsquo;d tackle hydration first.</p>
<p>There is what I call and what I think has now</p>
<p>come to be known as the Galpin equation,</p>
<p>which you really do deserve credit for</p>
<p>because I think that people realize</p>
<p>that there are a range of solutions out there,</p>
<p>but there is a desperate need for straightforward solutions</p>
<p>that work for 75% of people 75% of the time.</p>
<p>So hydration is key.</p>
<p>Maybe you could underscore just how key it is for us.</p>
<p>And then what is the Galpin equation as I call it,</p>
<p>and I think others are now referring to it.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>Benefits of hydration slash consequences of mishydration.</p>
<p>So whether it&rsquo;s dehydration or overload,</p>
<p>physiology has hormetic curves, right?</p>
<p>Now, typically we think about this in terms of toxicology.</p>
<p>So what this means is at some point,</p>
<p>giving you a dose of something,</p>
<p>testosterone is a very easy example.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re clinically deficient</p>
<p>or low in testosterone and I give you a little bit</p>
<p>and it brings you back into a normal range,</p>
<p>you generally see an improvement</p>
<p>in health and functionality.</p>
<p>Taking you though from normal to super high</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t always necessarily provide additional benefit.</p>
<p>In fact, if you continue to go,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna provide detriment, right?</p>
<p>So everything has this curve.</p>
<p>And then some things are hormetic stressors,</p>
<p>which means like a small, short, fast insult</p>
<p>is actually beneficial because then you come back</p>
<p>bigger, faster, stronger.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how adaptation works.</p>
<p>Basic hormesis, okay.</p>
<p>Hydration is the same way.</p>
<p>So at the end of the curve here,</p>
<p>if you are under hydrated,</p>
<p>we all know you could die, right?</p>
<p>You have to have things.</p>
<p>In fact, water is the only thing</p>
<p>that is ubiquitous across biologies</p>
<p>in terms of every living thing has to have it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no other vitamin, mineral, nutrient</p>
<p>that is required among all living things</p>
<p>with the exception of water.</p>
<p>So that should give you a pretty good indication</p>
<p>of it&rsquo;s importante, right?</p>
<p>Like you gotta have this thing.</p>
<p>Down here at the bottom, if you&rsquo;re dehydrated</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna give you more, it&rsquo;s beneficial effects.</p>
<p>However, if you&rsquo;re up the top already</p>
<p>and I continue to give you more water past that,</p>
<p>now we run into actual problems</p>
<p>and we can get what&rsquo;s called hyponatremia,</p>
<p>which is more common than people realize.</p>
<p>Natremia being actually not referring to the water,</p>
<p>but the sodium concentration being too low.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve probably talked about that</p>
<p>at length of why that&rsquo;s an issue.</p>
<p>If sodium potassium balances outside a cell come off,</p>
<p>heart stops, right?</p>
<p>Muscle contraction ends and all these things.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t wanna be over or under hydrated.</p>
<p>So understanding this rough equation</p>
<p>I sort of loosely calculated one day is helpful for that.</p>
<p>I think the most context is talking about</p>
<p>how much water to drink throughout the day</p>
<p>and then how much water to drink during exercise.</p>
<p>So the very easy answer is half your body weight</p>
<p>in ounces per day is a very loose guideline</p>
<p>for total amount of fluid consumption.</p>
<p>So if you weigh 200 pounds, aim for 100 ounces of water.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a very easy number.</p>
<p>If you hit that, you&rsquo;re probably I&rsquo;d say 90%</p>
<p>of you are good 90% of the time alone.</p>
<p>If you then go to exercise,</p>
<p>you need to then account for that fluid loss with exercise.</p>
<p>And in general, you wanna consume 125% to 150%</p>
<p>of the amount of weight you lost in fluid.</p>
<p>In other words, if you worked out</p>
<p>and you were 200 pounds naked,</p>
<p>and you went and did your workout</p>
<p>and then you dried off and you weighed yourself again,</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;re 198 pounds,</p>
<p>you lost two pounds of water, that&rsquo;s 32 ounces.</p>
<p>You wanna drink back about 125% of that.</p>
<p>So instead of drinking 32 ounces,</p>
<p>I want you to drink 40, 42, 45, like something like this.</p>
<p>Because one of the reasons why is,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re drinking something that is isotonic,</p>
<p>meaning the same exact concentration in your blood</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re in your fluid,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just gonna go closer to that hyponatremia.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get a bunch of baroreflector responses</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to actually think you have too much fluid</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna urinate it out.</p>
<p>So what if I&rsquo;m not weighing myself before and after workouts</p>
<p>and is there a shorthand version of this</p>
<p>that after training for an hour,</p>
<p>I should drink at least X number of ounces?</p>
<p>Assuming it&rsquo;s at kind of taller,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sweating super heavily.</p>
<p>Yeah, in that particular case,</p>
<p>you could probably go something like</p>
<p>if everyone in the world did, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>12 to 20 ounces, that&rsquo;s probably pretty decent.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re probably doing that, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And what about electrolytes,</p>
<p>consuming salt, potassium, and magnesium?</p>
<p>But that thing only works, though,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re coming in at optimal hydration.</p>
<p>And this is the problem.</p>
<p>This is why you have to flag this</p>
<p>starting with a good total daily amount of water.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re coming in and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh, I drank two or three glasses of water a day,</p>
<p>then you might need to drink 50 or 60 ounces post-workout</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re way behind.</p>
<p>So that like, oh, 12 ounces or so works</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re already generally very well hydrated.</p>
<p>And if people are drinking, you know,</p>
<p>four to six glasses of water a day,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re also drinking a lot of caffeine in any form,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re going to be excreting more water</p>
<p>in most cases, right?</p>
<p>Well-</p>
<p>Because caffeine&rsquo;s a diuretic.</p>
<p>Okay, it kind of is, but it kind of isn&rsquo;t either.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the diuretic that we used to think about it as.</p>
<p>It is still fluid consumption.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s only a diuretic if it causes you</p>
<p>to excrete more fluid than it actually was being intake.</p>
<p>So if caffeine intake is in a normal range,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to worry about the diuretic effects.</p>
<p>If someone is drinking 12 cups of coffee a day,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re taking caffeine pills or something,</p>
<p>now the excretion is going to outkick the coverage.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re going to have problems, right?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s no fluid consumption with a caffeine pill.</p>
<p>So in general, things like tea consumption,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m not super worried about those things.</p>
<p>You can count those towards your total fluid intake</p>
<p>if you want.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re like, I drink 60 ounces of water</p>
<p>plus 20 ounces of coffee, and then this,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to add that all up</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to be totally okay.</p>
<p>So natural, you also have problems</p>
<p>with synthetic forms of caffeine</p>
<p>versus natural forms of caffeine.</p>
<p>Natural forms are pretty okay.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be just fine.</p>
<p>So coffee, tea, et cetera.</p>
<p>Yeah, all that stuff.</p>
<p>Pill form is where it gets tricky.</p>
<p>Always, like always, right?</p>
<p>So general, just eat real food and things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be just fine.</p>
<p>The last piece to consider is your diet quality matters</p>
<p>because the fluid content in your food can vary wildly.</p>
<p>So something like a bagel might be five to 10% water</p>
<p>or something like a watermelon is 98%, 95%,</p>
<p>something in a huge range.</p>
<p>Even meat is very high percentage of fluid intake.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s really high.</p>
<p>Even after you cook it,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still a lot of fluid in there.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re eating a whole food,</p>
<p>mostly whole food-based diet,</p>
<p>your endogenous hydration is actually pretty high already</p>
<p>just from your fluid.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re eating a very highly processed,</p>
<p>dehydrated, over-salted diet,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re way low on hydration just in your food.</p>
<p>So you have to factor all these things in.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the things that happens to us constantly</p>
<p>with folks that go from a highly processed,</p>
<p>low-quality diet to a high-quality one</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re just peeing nonstop.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, what the hell is going on?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, well, you&rsquo;re actually have brought in</p>
<p>60 additional ounces of water in your diet</p>
<p>relative to what you used to have.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve gone from 10 grams of sodium there to four,</p>
<p>to two, sometimes one.</p>
<p>Sometimes it gets very low</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not like salt.</p>
<p>Are you salting your food?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay, well, we don&rsquo;t have sodium intake then.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re way down.</p>
<p>So everything that we&rsquo;re considering is based on that.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s assume someone&rsquo;s eating</p>
<p>a pretty well-balanced diet.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re drinking 60 ounces of water</p>
<p>and maybe some caffeine, coffee and tea, things like that.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t exactly know the optimal amount</p>
<p>of sodium one should intake.</p>
<p>It is very clear.</p>
<p>High sodium concentrations are still associated</p>
<p>with a lot of negative health outcomes,</p>
<p>especially in combination with poor physical activity,</p>
<p>in combination with low food quality</p>
<p>and other comorbidities.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very bad thing.</p>
<p>You need to be very careful about those things.</p>
<p>If everything else is okay,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re okay playing with a little bit higher salt.</p>
<p>In fact, you&rsquo;re probably gonna feel better.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna feel generally pretty good.</p>
<p>You just, it needs to be very clear.</p>
<p>If you are overweight, highly stressed</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have a lot of these things ticked off</p>
<p>and you have known comorbidities,</p>
<p>you really need to pay attention to salt intake.</p>
<p>It can be very nasty.</p>
<p>So that being said,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re generally going to look at, folks,</p>
<p>is are you at least,</p>
<p>can we categorize you as a low-sodium or high-sodium sweater?</p>
<p>If so, there&rsquo;s a whole list of electrolytes you can look on</p>
<p>that are gonna have something like</p>
<p>200 to 400 milligrams per serving.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole list of these things.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a low-sodium sweater,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably gonna send you after one of those.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a high-sodium sweater,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of electrolyte supplements</p>
<p>that are closer to six or 800,</p>
<p>even a whole gram per single serving size.</p>
<p>So you wanna play with that.</p>
<p>A very-</p>
<p>How do you know if you&rsquo;re a low-sodium</p>
<p>or high-sodium sweater?</p>
<p>We actually have an episode on salt</p>
<p>we put out that, or is coming out soon,</p>
<p>if hasn&rsquo;t come out already,</p>
<p>which is, you know,</p>
<p>when you look at the hazard ratios for salt intake,</p>
<p>basically, your probability</p>
<p>of really bad things happen to you</p>
<p>goes way up as you get towards a lot of sodium intake,</p>
<p>you know, 10, 12 grams per day.</p>
<p>And this is translated to teaspoons of salt, et cetera.</p>
<p>But also, very low-sodium intake is a problem.</p>
<p>No question about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a perfectly U-shape.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a J-shaped curve,</p>
<p>or a kind of hockey stick shape, more or less.</p>
<p>But how would I know if I&rsquo;m a low-sodium</p>
<p>or a high-sodium sweater?</p>
<p>Yeah, so you can get-</p>
<p>Would I just kind of lick my sweat</p>
<p>or have someone else do it?</p>
<p>Well, you can.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Find a super friend who&rsquo;ll lick your sweat for you.</p>
<p>Same with how-</p>
<p>No willing volunteers that I&rsquo;m aware of,</p>
<p>but would I be able to tell?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You can get sweat testing done.</p>
<p>Actually, you have a number of options.</p>
<p>The kind of the original one</p>
<p>that most of us use in the background for many years</p>
<p>was called Lebelin.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll send you out a little patch.</p>
<p>You can wear that, send it in the lab,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll measure it directly in the lab</p>
<p>and send it back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about 150 bucks or-</p>
<p>Do they bin you into low, medium, and high sodium?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna do that,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re gonna tell you exactly the milligrams.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re gonna actually tell you</p>
<p>what products and stuff that are exactly matched.</p>
<p>Do you do this with professional athletes?</p>
<p>We have many times.</p>
<p>Yeah. Interesting.</p>
<p>You can do a more consumer-grade version.</p>
<p>Gatorade has a patch.</p>
<p>For 25 bucks, you can get two of them.</p>
<p>You can put that patch on your left forearm</p>
<p>and download the Gatorade app,</p>
<p>and you can do a workout,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll measure it right there and click it over,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll tell you exactly,</p>
<p>not only high or low, but again,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll tell you the milligrams of sodium</p>
<p>that are in your sweat,</p>
<p>and then you can figure out, again,</p>
<p>kind of high, medium, or low.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I do much better on a slightly higher sodium intake.</p>
<p>Most do.</p>
<p>But in my carbohydrate, I do eat carbohydrates.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of those that is pretty moderate,</p>
<p>but I try and eat clean food.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d notice, and I tend to be slightly low blood pressure.</p>
<p>So again, to reiterate the warning there,</p>
<p>that if somebody is prehypertension</p>
<p>or has hypertension or obese,</p>
<p>you really do need to be careful with your sodium intake.</p>
<p>But many people seem to find that they feel better</p>
<p>when they increase their sodium intake,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re still in that healthy portion</p>
<p>of the hazard ratio curve.</p>
<p>Most of the athletes, I would say, in general,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna go higher in salt.</p>
<p>When they come, we&rsquo;re gonna run their stuff,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna add salt.</p>
<p>Almost always.</p>
<p>Very few times have I gone, ah, we need to cut this back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of the exception of the ones that come in</p>
<p>that eat like 14-year-olds.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, okay, you&rsquo;re at 15 milligrams,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re 15 grams a day,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re eating nothing but-</p>
<p>Garbage.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re like, we&rsquo;re gonna come down,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna feel way better.</p>
<p>All this bloating and everything else</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna happen, go down.</p>
<p>You can do that.</p>
<p>There are biosensors that are coming out</p>
<p>that are not available yet,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re coming very soon in this space</p>
<p>that are gonna give you real-time metrics on salt.</p>
<p>So you can pay attention to those.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen one and used one personally,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t wanna espouse about how good or bad it is,</p>
<p>but I know that those are coming</p>
<p>from a handful of companies.</p>
<p>An easy way to do is just look at, wear a hat,</p>
<p>or wear some sort of headband or something</p>
<p>and do your workout.</p>
<p>Take it off.</p>
<p>If you see a just huge white band,</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s completely clear,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s gonna tell you, big white band,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably a high-salt sweater.</p>
<p>Completely clear, very little coming out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And I can see the posts on Instagram now,</p>
<p>people showing their salt band from sweating.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously salt is so essential</p>
<p>for so many physiological functions.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want too high or too low,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re losing more,</p>
<p>it makes sense that you would need to take in more.</p>
<p>So half of my body weight in ounces</p>
<p>as a just foundation of a fluid intake.</p>
<p>Coffee and tea could be included in that,</p>
<p>but that should probably be mostly water</p>
<p>or things similar to it.</p>
<p>And then during exercise,</p>
<p>how do I wanna think about this again?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m a high-salt output,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;d wanna drink maybe 40 ounces of water or more.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do this easier.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about pre and mid and post.</p>
<p>So what to drink pre.</p>
<p>If you come in having hit these rules, you&rsquo;re okay.</p>
<p>And pre workout can be as little</p>
<p>as like five or six ounces.</p>
<p>Basically a couple sips of water, fine.</p>
<p>If you come in poorly hydrated,</p>
<p>then you maybe need to go more like 12,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>If you start off a session in a bad spot,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna catch back up.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re in trouble.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you come in, you follow directions.</p>
<p>500 milligrams salt before, 500 milligrams after.</p>
<p>Very easy rule.</p>
<p>Pick whatever source you want.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a couple of sprinkles of table salt.</p>
<p>If you want Himalayan, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>Himalayan is actually a fairly low sodium salt.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not the best for this purposes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re higher, saltier sweater, a little bit more.</p>
<p>If you wanna go choose an electrolyte</p>
<p>of which there are infinite,</p>
<p>you can look on the packet</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll tell you 250 milligrams per serving</p>
<p>or 400 or 600 or whatever happens to be.</p>
<p>But around 500, pre 500 post is a very general rule.</p>
<p>And then during is thanks to you,</p>
<p>my famous Galpin equation now that is all over the world.</p>
<p>All I did is I took the literature and I said,</p>
<p>okay, in general, the research shows pretty clearly</p>
<p>two milligrams per kilogram body weight over 15 minutes</p>
<p>seems to put you in a pretty good spot.</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t think about kilograms or milliliters.</p>
<p>So can I just run that over?</p>
<p>And it turns out it&rsquo;s about your body weight</p>
<p>divided by 30 in ounces.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s all you have to do.</p>
<p>Body weight in pounds divided by 30.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly right.</p>
<p>So you weigh 200 pounds divided by 30</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the number of ounces.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna wanna go every 15 or 20 minutes.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m getting that amount every 15 to 20 minutes</p>
<p>throughout the training.</p>
<p>And now in the weight room, that&rsquo;s pretty easy to do</p>
<p>because there are rest intervals,</p>
<p>but people will need to do this while running or cycling.</p>
<p>And that can cause a little bit of gastric distress</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not used to it.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>So you can learn to run with some water in your belly.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>The gut is very trainable in a lot of directions,</p>
<p>but in terms of fluid, as well as carbohydrate,</p>
<p>which is another thing that is gonna get people.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s, yeah, very trainable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be uncomfortable initially,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ll quickly get into it.</p>
<p>The better solution for those folks, just come in hydrated.</p>
<p>And you might not even need any water.</p>
<p>You could probably perform just fine.</p>
<p>So the ones that don&rsquo;t have as much of an opportunity,</p>
<p>you really have to emphasize walking in.</p>
<p>We have this problem with professional golfers.</p>
<p>They have plenty of time to drink water,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re so focused on the shot.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of variables coming up.</p>
<p>Once they hit their shot</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re moving on to the next one,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re thinking about,</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re going over a scorecard of 185 yards away.</p>
<p>Can I go 184 and a half yards?</p>
<p>Can I go 186 yards?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the slope of that?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the wind up here?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the wind up there?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just a thinking and they just forget,</p>
<p>even though they have four and a half hours.</p>
<p>So we have to make sure</p>
<p>that they immediately get off the course.</p>
<p>We go right into recovery as hard as we possibly can.</p>
<p>They wake up the next morning, they&rsquo;re in a good spot.</p>
<p>We crush recovery.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s like, hey,</p>
<p>if you can remember to drink this, great.</p>
<p>If not, we&rsquo;re still fine.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not a big deal and you have time,</p>
<p>like in a lifter,</p>
<p>because I deal with that problem with fighters too.</p>
<p>Like we can only drink so much in the middle of a fight.</p>
<p>A couple of sips over there,</p>
<p>but we can&rsquo;t go mixing.</p>
<p>Two milliliters, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>can you get a couple of sips in?</p>
<p>Yeah, oh shit, forgot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna happen.</p>
<p>So we have to take more of an emphasis before and after.</p>
<p>So start your recovery process immediately</p>
<p>and then come in the next day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your window.</p>
<p>And then whatever you can get in during the workout,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fine too.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a higher salt sweater,</p>
<p>instead of doing 500, 500,</p>
<p>maybe go 750, 750.</p>
<p>If you have a longer bout of exercise,</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s hot or humid,</p>
<p>then you might wanna consider some salt</p>
<p>in the workout as well.</p>
<p>And 300 milligrams during the workout, totally fine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<p>If it is a really long workout and it&rsquo;s really hot</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna lose pounds during it,</p>
<p>you need a specific strategy.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna lose less than a pound,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to worry about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna be enough of a detriment</p>
<p>for you to really care.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of a rough rule.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re 200 plus pounds,</p>
<p>maybe that number moves from one pound to two pounds.</p>
<p>But really the number we&rsquo;re looking at</p>
<p>is what 1% of your body weight.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re losing more than 1% of your body weight,</p>
<p>we need to start caring.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s less than 1%,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna really pay that much of a difference.</p>
<p>Okay, so for myself,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t get super technical,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wear any devices besides a wristwatch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nice watch.</p>
<p>Thanks, yeah, very attached to this watch</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s attached to me, I suppose.</p>
<p>My body weight in pounds divided by two,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m gonna try and get across the entire day</p>
<p>as a kind of baseline.</p>
<p>And then my body weight in pounds</p>
<p>divided by 30 during the workout,</p>
<p>every 15 or 20 minutes,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m going to try and consume that amount.</p>
<p>And then I definitely do better</p>
<p>when I increase the amount of salt that I&rsquo;m taking in,</p>
<p>anywhere from 500 milligrams to a gram of salt</p>
<p>several times a day, actually.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not eating that often,</p>
<p>which leads me to my other question,</p>
<p>which is I prefer to train fasted or semi-fasted,</p>
<p>meaning first thing in the morning</p>
<p>or within an hour or two of waking.</p>
<p>Obviously, I&rsquo;ve been fasting while I&rsquo;m asleep</p>
<p>or having not eaten anything for three or four hours before,</p>
<p>I just feel lighter and more energetic.</p>
<p>If that works for me, is that okay?</p>
<p>Or should I try,</p>
<p>is it better to eat something before one trains?</p>
<p>Personal preference, easy answer there.</p>
<p>It depends on, of course, how hard you trained,</p>
<p>what the training was like,</p>
<p>what sport you&rsquo;re involved with,</p>
<p>how many telekinesis, et cetera.</p>
<p>But in general, personal preference</p>
<p>for the average person.</p>
<p>That probably handles 90% of the questions about that.</p>
<p>Cold, cold showers, ice baths,</p>
<p>and cold immersion up to the neck.</p>
<p>I always preface this by saying</p>
<p>there are not a lot of studies.</p>
<p>There are some, but not a lot of controlled studies</p>
<p>looking at cold showers</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s harder to control the variables</p>
<p>of where people stand.</p>
<p>So I would say if you have access to cold immersion</p>
<p>of some sort, ice bath or cold immersion, great.</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t, cold showers</p>
<p>would be the next best thing.</p>
<p>The lore goes that if you do an ice bath</p>
<p>or cold water immersion after strength</p>
<p>or hypertrophy training,</p>
<p>that you are short-circuiting some of that.</p>
<p>The lore also goes that cold showers might be okay.</p>
<p>And my interpretation of those data and that discussion</p>
<p>is that all that is probably true,</p>
<p>but I have a hard time imagining</p>
<p>that the effects are so robust</p>
<p>that it can completely prevent strength gains</p>
<p>and hypertrophy,</p>
<p>such that my stance for myself</p>
<p>is try and do the cold exposure training</p>
<p>away from the strength and hypertrophy training.</p>
<p>But if you can&rsquo;t do it any other time,</p>
<p>right afterward probably isn&rsquo;t gonna throw</p>
<p>my whole system out of whack and prevent the improvements.</p>
<p>Am I diluting myself?</p>
<p>A couple of caveats here.</p>
<p>Number one, I would say I have a personal vested interest</p>
<p>in cold.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been around this stuff for a long time.</p>
<p>Being involved and being an advisor for XPT</p>
<p>and being in this space a long time,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big believer in cold, especially cold water.</p>
<p>Deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>100%, right?</p>
<p>So that being said,</p>
<p>I do think getting into an ice bath</p>
<p>immediately after a hypertrophy session</p>
<p>is getting pretty close to</p>
<p>you just shouldn&rsquo;t have done the session.</p>
<p>It is detrimental.</p>
<p>Good to know.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>I guess is the most blunt way to put it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like, hey,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not super concerned with growing muscle</p>
<p>and I want these other things</p>
<p>that come with cold water immersion, fine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a zero.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not zero.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not taking you backwards.</p>
<p>How much does it cut you down?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be a difficult number to come up with.</p>
<p>Is it 1% reduction?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s more than that.</p>
<p>Is it 100?</p>
<p>Not even close.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where it lands though.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s enough though for me to go,</p>
<p>in general, best practices,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get in the ice immediately after a workout.</p>
<p>How long should I wait?</p>
<p>Well, in theory,</p>
<p>the best answer we could give you would be four hours</p>
<p>because of what we talked about earlier today</p>
<p>of going, okay,</p>
<p>immediately you&rsquo;ve got the signaling cascade</p>
<p>that takes seconds.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got gene expression that&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in this rough four hour window.</p>
<p>After the genes have gone off</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;re just going through</p>
<p>the protein synthesis process,</p>
<p>the signal&rsquo;s already there</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gone back down to baseline.</p>
<p>So then reintroducing or introducing cold here</p>
<p>is not gonna disrupt that signal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very non-scientifically founded,</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t know at this point at all.</p>
<p>What is very clear though</p>
<p>is if you get off your workout,</p>
<p>go right into the ice,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably 10% attenuation of growth.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, maybe more.</p>
<p>Depends on the person.</p>
<p>Some people, if you look at the individual data,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s enough to where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really big deal.</p>
<p>The benefits of the ice,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think now outweigh</p>
<p>the benefits of the hypertrophy training.</p>
<p>What about cold showers?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think cold showers are gonna do much.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been in both,</p>
<p>you know that this is like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not playing the same game here.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>An ice bath or cold water,</p>
<p>true cold water immersion up to the neck</p>
<p>with limbs in for one to five minutes</p>
<p>is a completely different stimulus</p>
<p>than in the cold shower.</p>
<p>Especially also compared to a similar, like cryo.</p>
<p>Right, it&rsquo;s not even the same thing here.</p>
<p>So in general, I would say don&rsquo;t do those.</p>
<p>Cold shower, I don&rsquo;t really care.</p>
<p>Can you work it out</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t do them at the same time?</p>
<p>That would be my hope, right?</p>
<p>I would actually prefer you do the cold before,</p>
<p>if you really had to do it.</p>
<p>Certainly will wake you up,</p>
<p>get that adrenaline burst.</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;ve played with that actually years ago,</p>
<p>doing that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually some fun stuff you can do</p>
<p>with the endurance piece with cold stuff,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s totally not feasible for most people</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re getting water everywhere.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna jump on your bike and just get shit.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just a giant mess.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun, but yeah, I would say walk away from it.</p>
<p>If you can, that&rsquo;s actually,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s where I stand based on the data.</p>
<p>Based on my intuition and experience,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a good thing to do.</p>
<p>Now, having said that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s mostly concerned with maximizing hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Strength is not as clear.</p>
<p>There are some data to show it actual block</p>
<p>strength adaptations,</p>
<p>but because of what we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>the mechanisms and the drivers are different.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s as big a concern</p>
<p>for strength development,</p>
<p>though I would still generally say,</p>
<p>if you can get away with staying out of the ice</p>
<p>immediately after the workout,</p>
<p>and you can at least wait a few hours,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the better approach.</p>
<p>Less concerned with strength,</p>
<p>more concerned with hypertrophy</p>
<p>in terms of interference effect.</p>
<p>If you can do it on off days or before or any other time,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the place to land.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s generally when I tried to do it.</p>
<p>I was just kind of throwing out an extreme case</p>
<p>because I get asked that question a lot.</p>
<p>What about the use of ice bath or cold water immersion</p>
<p>or cold shower after endurance training?</p>
<p>Okay, so a couple of interesting things here.</p>
<p>You mentioned we don&rsquo;t have a tremendous amount of data</p>
<p>on cold water immersion overall.</p>
<p>So a lot of this is moving.</p>
<p>There have been some papers to show</p>
<p>that cold water immersion</p>
<p>can actually enhance mitochondrial biogenesis.</p>
<p>And actually even for endurance stuff,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been shown to cause improvement</p>
<p>in endurance adaptations relative to not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not enough for me to be truly confident</p>
<p>in that statement yet.</p>
<p>I would like to see that repeated.</p>
<p>Not that I have a problem with the paper,</p>
<p>the methodology that they use in that particular study,</p>
<p>but this is a weird thing.</p>
<p>So I wanna see this repeated more often.</p>
<p>So I have less concern</p>
<p>with doing it immediately post endurance</p>
<p>because you could even argue that there may be some benefit.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you need to go out of your way</p>
<p>to try to make sure you get an ice immediately afterwards</p>
<p>and thinking you&rsquo;re gonna get some massive adaptation.</p>
<p>We use ice a decent amount when I can get athletes to do it,</p>
<p>but this context is different.</p>
<p>Number one, when we&rsquo;re in camp</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve got a world title fight coming up</p>
<p>or something else,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve just pitched in a major baseball game.</p>
<p>I am not concerned about hypertrophy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even concerned with strength development.</p>
<p>I am now pushing towards recovery.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a paradigm that I think is important</p>
<p>with all of these things to understand,</p>
<p>which is, are you pushing for optimization or adaptation?</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re pushing for adaptation,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t wanna block the signal for adaptation.</p>
<p>This means less recovery.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to feel as good</p>
<p>and you probably should be hedging towards stress.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re pushing for optimization, it&rsquo;s the opposite.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m in season and I had a pitcher</p>
<p>just throw 125 pitches,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to cause adaptation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to recover as quickly as possible</p>
<p>because four days from now, we gotta do this again.</p>
<p>And I gotta do this across 162 games.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna play five days in a PGA golf tournament</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna have to do it again every week</p>
<p>for a bunch of weeks in a row.</p>
<p>I need recovery as fast as I possibly can.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m blunting adaptation, fine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not actually trying to do that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to optimize.</p>
<p>If you spend all of your time in one of those two areas,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have problems.</p>
<p>So you need to be judicious about thinking,</p>
<p>is this a point in my life or training cycle</p>
<p>that I want to cause adaptations</p>
<p>or am I trying to optimize?</p>
<p>You spend too much time in one of the other ones,</p>
<p>again, you&rsquo;re gonna have problems.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s in generally how I will treat</p>
<p>the ice for all those adaptations.</p>
<p>What about heat?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>When, and I&rsquo;ll frame this question differently</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m sure there are a number of ways</p>
<p>in which heat can short circuit all sorts of things.</p>
<p>I mean, heat in excess can kill you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It can shut down fertility.</p>
<p>In excess, right?</p>
<p>It can do all sorts of things,</p>
<p>but it can also increase growth hormone,</p>
<p>increase vasodilation, improve one&rsquo;s ability to sweat,</p>
<p>which can be very beneficial in a number of contexts.</p>
<p>For the typical, for 75% of people, 75% of the time,</p>
<p>when do you think heat is most useful?</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m referring to dry sauna or wet sauna.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not specifically talking about infrared sauna</p>
<p>because the data there are a little unclear to me.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t even know that,</p>
<p>my sense with infrared saunas is they don&rsquo;t go hot enough</p>
<p>for my particular taste.</p>
<p>You and I have a similar taste there.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not crushing 200 past, I&rsquo;m not interested.</p>
<p>Right, and my sense about infrared sauna</p>
<p>is that maybe I haven&rsquo;t seen the data is that,</p>
<p>but that a lot of people like it</p>
<p>because they like the way they look in the infrared sauna.</p>
<p>It feels cool.</p>
<p>It feels like you&rsquo;re doing something unusual.</p>
<p>Now, infrared lights are beneficial for other reasons,</p>
<p>actually for mitochondrial health and the retinas,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re good data.</p>
<p>But infrared sauna, to me, it never goes hot enough.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m talking about 200 or hotter, maybe 180 to 220,</p>
<p>obviously do what&rsquo;s safe, folks,</p>
<p>and heed all the warnings about pregnant people</p>
<p>not going in saunas, et cetera.</p>
<p>I assume you&rsquo;re lumping in hot water immersion.</p>
<p>Hot water immersion, so hot baths, hot sauna.</p>
<p>When would you like,</p>
<p>when do you think most people could leverage sauna</p>
<p>or hot baths to benefit their training</p>
<p>and fitness and health?</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, I have a handful of things</p>
<p>to say about this topic.</p>
<p>One of them is you never have a hard time</p>
<p>convincing people to get hot.</p>
<p>Everyone feels good, like, yeah, getting a hot bath,</p>
<p>like, can you take more hot showers?</p>
<p>Sure, like, no problem there, right?</p>
<p>There are a handful of studies</p>
<p>that have looked at this immediately post,</p>
<p>and it seems to even augment hypertrophy.</p>
<p>So after hypertrophy training,</p>
<p>getting in the sauna for 20 minutes?</p>
<p>Yeah, whatever, whatever it needs to be.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a good titration.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the number minutes-wise?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a temperature titration.</p>
<p>Hot shower would be a second,</p>
<p>that would be a weak second best.</p>
<p>I would say it&rsquo;s a very weak second.</p>
<p>Take a hot bath.</p>
<p>I think a hot bath is probably a lot closer</p>
<p>to what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>It actually kind of goes back</p>
<p>to our initial conversations.</p>
<p>Theoretically, you&rsquo;re just going to aid in blood flow.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna put more nutrients in,</p>
<p>more waste product out, metabolic stress,</p>
<p>all that stuff is going through.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the thought anyways, far from it.</p>
<p>Makes sense.</p>
<p>Plausible, right?</p>
<p>Absolutely plausible.</p>
<p>Something people will do, feels good.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say with cold and hot,</p>
<p>I want to caution you against a couple of things.</p>
<p>This is true across all physiology,</p>
<p>but you need to be really careful</p>
<p>about moving percentages from molecular to outcome.</p>
<p>Very careful.</p>
<p>So for example, it&rsquo;s easy to see a paper that says,</p>
<p>okay, we put you in a hot bath or something</p>
<p>and we saw growth hormone increased 300%.</p>
<p>That is not going to result in 300% increase</p>
<p>in muscle size, right?</p>
<p>In fact, 300% might result in absolutely no change</p>
<p>in physical size, right?</p>
<p>So the reason I&rsquo;m saying this is</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of people in this space</p>
<p>that will misapply the mechanisms.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll grossly overestimate what these things can do</p>
<p>and what they do do,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ll find something like that.</p>
<p>I mean, you know this, you&rsquo;ve done enough cellular work too.</p>
<p>In the lab, if I see mTOR doubled,</p>
<p>I think, shit, it didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>I need to see a 10X increase before I know it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even physiologically relevant.</p>
<p>So reading that paper,</p>
<p>reading some of the social media posts,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, wow, it increased mTOR 38%.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, well, it didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, wow, that&rsquo;s huge.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, that&rsquo;s not 38% increase in muscle size.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a very important point I wanna make</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m gonna talk about the benefits here in a second.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t want people to be fooled</p>
<p>into thinking that this is some crazy miracle.</p>
<p>The same thing with the sauna.</p>
<p>In terms of general health outcomes,</p>
<p>it is clearly a beneficial thing.</p>
<p>This is a really good idea to get hot a lot.</p>
<p>It is not a substitute for exercise though.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very important distinction.</p>
<p>If the options are nothing or sauna, get in the sauna.</p>
<p>Really, really good idea.</p>
<p>If the exchange is though,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to work out because I did the sauna, bad.</p>
<p>This is not a winning solution.</p>
<p>You and I know some maniacs</p>
<p>that actually work out in the sauna.</p>
<p>Oh, we do, yeah, kind of not far away.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily recommend that.</p>
<p>That actually would probably kill a large number of people,</p>
<p>but it can be worked up to, certainly.</p>
<p>Yeah, so every time I talk about that, I flag that</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just too easy to hear that and go,</p>
<p>oh, well, I think Dr. Huberman said,</p>
<p>if I just get in the sauna, I don&rsquo;t have to work out.</p>
<p>Like, no, no, those words have never come out of his mouth.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m definitely not working out in the sauna.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m in the sauna, I&rsquo;m either sitting or I&rsquo;m lying down</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m trying to make it through.</p>
<p>I tend to do three 20-minute bouts across the entire week.</p>
<p>So I aim for 60 minutes per week of heat exposure,</p>
<p>which is not a ton.</p>
<p>If I said I&rsquo;ve never worked out in the sauna.</p>
<p>Oh, so you&rsquo;re one of those.</p>
<p>Yeah, people will do air squats.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll bring the Airdyne bike in there.</p>
<p>I look at the sauna as kind of a time to get lazy and sweat.</p>
<p>Totally fine.</p>
<p>Going back to your original question.</p>
<p>So potential to aid, plausible aid,</p>
<p>we need to see more research on that</p>
<p>to really get a deny to put this in practice.</p>
<p>I think if you try it, very little harm.</p>
<p>I struggle to see a downside</p>
<p>if you make sure your hydration&rsquo;s on point, right?</p>
<p>Because now you&rsquo;ve got to factor in the fact</p>
<p>you just kicked out two or three pounds.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re you at 200 plus pounds, I assume, or roughly,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in the sauna for 20 minutes,</p>
<p>I would imagine you can do two, three pounds.</p>
<p>Yeah, usually I&rsquo;m hovering somewhere around like 225.</p>
<p>And I drink a 32-ounce beverage,</p>
<p>water with an electrolyte solution</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty high salt afterwards and sometimes during.</p>
<p>And sometimes after that, if I do it late in the evening,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go to sleep and I&rsquo;ll wake up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>just feeling so parched.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how much water one loses in the sauna.</p>
<p>Like a normal sweat rate for someone 225, especially,</p>
<p>and 20 minutes in a sauna,</p>
<p>I would absolutely expect you to do three pounds.</p>
<p>Easy, without like-</p>
<p>So I should be drinking more, even more water.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re probably half the water that you need to get.</p>
<p>And you mentioned the possible benefits</p>
<p>of doing it after strength hypertrophy training,</p>
<p>which makes sense for plausible mechanistic reasons.</p>
<p>No official data there yet.</p>
<p>What about after endurance training?</p>
<p>Assuming somebody hydrates well enough</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not overheated from their endurance work,</p>
<p>could also be a benefit.</p>
<p>Wow, so more and more what I&rsquo;m thinking the framework here</p>
<p>is in an ideal world, one would train and then do sauna</p>
<p>or heat exposure of some kind,</p>
<p>endurance training or strength hypertrophy training,</p>
<p>and then do sauna and then do cold exposure</p>
<p>on off days or at least four hours away</p>
<p>from any kind of training.</p>
<p>Or if you had to do it close to train,</p>
<p>doing it before training.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love the cold in the morning.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve actually run this experiment on professional athletes</p>
<p>where we do enough tracking with things like HRV,</p>
<p>which is a global metric of like overall fatigue.</p>
<p>Okay, and you&rsquo;ve probably talked about that before,</p>
<p>but problems with it, but roughly ideal overall fatigue.</p>
<p>HRV in general, higher the score, the better, right?</p>
<p>So low HRV is fatigue, right?</p>
<p>Well, if you wake up and take your HRV in the morning</p>
<p>and then you get into ice, what&rsquo;s gonna happen</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re gonna see that number plummet.</p>
<p>The second you get out, that&rsquo;s gonna fall off the earth,</p>
<p>which means roughly you&rsquo;ve moved into a sympathetic place.</p>
<p>Surprising, you get in 30 degree water,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna go very sympathetic very quickly.</p>
<p>However, if you continue to watch your HRV for 30,</p>
<p>60, 90, and up to two to three hours post,</p>
<p>you will generally see an improved HRV score</p>
<p>relative to where you started.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s back to this hormetic stressor, right?</p>
<p>A really cold, shocking exposure will be a net result</p>
<p>of you being more relaxed throughout the day in general.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve seen that now like very consistently</p>
<p>across years with athletes.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s a great way to start your day.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t need nearly as much coffee</p>
<p>after spending three minutes in 30 degree water.</p>
<p>30 degrees is pretty darn cold.</p>
<p>I was in the ocean this morning for about three minutes.</p>
<p>It felt, I didn&rsquo;t bring a thermometer,</p>
<p>but it felt like somewhere in the low 50s.</p>
<p>But 50 and moving is really cold.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Water&rsquo;s moving, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really cold.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>The thermal layer that surrounds you</p>
<p>when you sit still in a cold water immersion,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m encouraging people now if they really,</p>
<p>I was the joke that, you know,</p>
<p>people like to look real stoic and tough</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re in there,</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re just grinding through it with no pain at all.</p>
<p>But the stillness is actually reducing the stimulus.</p>
<p>If they sift around a little bit,</p>
<p>you break up that thermal layer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the real action is.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve joked about this for years,</p>
<p>like do 50 degrees with a Whirlpool jet on.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m impressed.</p>
<p>Because that is hard.</p>
<p>You sit in 35 degree for three minutes.</p>
<p>I guess.</p>
<p>But with XPT, I&rsquo;ve seen,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even tell you how many hundreds of people</p>
<p>from all walks of life, on all age,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been able to get in 30 some degree water</p>
<p>for three minutes.</p>
<p>50 degrees with a Whirlpool going,</p>
<p>that number gets very small.</p>
<p>Yeah, and if you don&rsquo;t have access to a Whirlpool,</p>
<p>this should be reassuring to you.</p>
<p>Some people say, oh, you know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have access to ice.</p>
<p>And ice can actually get pretty expensive</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing a $50 ice bath every day.</p>
<p>So you can fill your bathtub with cool to cold water,</p>
<p>get in, but just make sure</p>
<p>that you keep sifting your limbs and it&rsquo;s chilly.</p>
<p>And the studies on the very well,</p>
<p>now well-established increases in dopamine and epinephrine</p>
<p>that occur in cold water exposure</p>
<p>were actually done at an hour in 60 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>And so you don&rsquo;t necessarily need an ice cold</p>
<p>or an ice bath,</p>
<p>but immersion is really better than the cold shower.</p>
<p>The cold shower is kind of a,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the, it&rsquo;s kind of the espresso shot version.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s sort of funny.</p>
<p>Because if you look at most of those initial studies</p>
<p>and you think, man,</p>
<p>how did they get people to sign up</p>
<p>to spend 45 minutes in 55 degree water?</p>
<p>55 degrees is cold, even if it&rsquo;s not moving.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re going to not spend five minutes in them,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to go an hour.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever done ice baths at that temperature,</p>
<p>you know, like, all right, after a few minutes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that bad, but man, that&rsquo;s a protocol.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s kind of a cold endurance protocol.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s one thing to get in</p>
<p>for one minute to three minutes</p>
<p>and you know you&rsquo;re getting out.</p>
<p>You could sing a song,</p>
<p>you could do anything to distract yourself,</p>
<p>but 45 minutes to an hour is intense.</p>
<p>Maybe they, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they paid the subjects,</p>
<p>but anyway, that study was done in Europe.</p>
<p>I forget where it was done,</p>
<p>but anyway, they were hardy subjects.</p>
<p>I want to talk a bit about over-training</p>
<p>and gauging recovery.</p>
<p>So there are a couple methods that I&rsquo;ve heard about</p>
<p>and that I use based on some data that I&rsquo;ve seen,</p>
<p>but mainly discussions with really informed people</p>
<p>like yourself, Brian McKenzie, Kelly Starrett, and others.</p>
<p>The two that I&rsquo;m aware of for gauging recovery</p>
<p>of the nervous system and kind of systemic recovery</p>
<p>are grip strength,</p>
<p>especially grip strength on waking in the morning,</p>
<p>and the so-called carbon dioxide tolerance test,</p>
<p>the ability to do a long controlled exhale</p>
<p>after a few rhythmic deep breaths,</p>
<p>just which I&rsquo;m assuming taps into both</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s ability to mechanically control the diaphragm,</p>
<p>but also how well one is regulating carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>First question is, is this stuff fiction, fact,</p>
<p>or a combination of kind of anecdata, as I call it?</p>
<p>Are there any peer-reviewed published data?</p>
<p>Is your lab working on these things,</p>
<p>and am I diluting myself using these tools,</p>
<p>or are they useful?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not fiction at all.</p>
<p>There are, with CO2 tolerance, there&rsquo;s less published data.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve run a study in our lab</p>
<p>looking at the associations between the CO2 tolerance</p>
<p>and what we call trait and state anxiety,</p>
<p>and those are in the publication process, is what I&rsquo;ll say.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t really talk about that stuff, as you know,</p>
<p>until it&rsquo;s out, but in general, I&rsquo;d say,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a reason I&rsquo;m still doing it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just leave it at that.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, assuming it&rsquo;s not a clinical trial,</p>
<p>I mean, I think sharing preliminary findings is fine,</p>
<p>as long as we highlight them as preliminary.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a reviewer,</p>
<p>but I look forward to reading the paper.</p>
<p>Yeah, but as you know, scientific ethically,</p>
<p>you need to be careful about telling people results</p>
<p>before you&rsquo;ve gone through that process.</p>
<p>Right, which is why I&rsquo;m flagging this</p>
<p>as these results are not yet passed</p>
<p>through the peer-review process,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re hearing about it prior to peer review.</p>
<p>Yep, having said that, there&rsquo;s enough in that field.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the first one into that field,</p>
<p>and so I&rsquo;m very confident that that&rsquo;s a real thing.</p>
<p>In terms of actual tracking recovery,</p>
<p>the big picture is this.</p>
<p>When we run through a full analysis,</p>
<p>when we have an athlete go through</p>
<p>our Biomolecular Athlete Program,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna run and we&rsquo;re gonna look at</p>
<p>three major categories.</p>
<p>Okay, category one are what we call visible stressors,</p>
<p>and then we have hidden stressors,</p>
<p>and then we have recovery capacity.</p>
<p>Anytime the total stress load outpaces recovery capacity,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re either going backwards in your physical ability,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re reducing adaptability.</p>
<p>Now, you have levers to pull here.</p>
<p>You can reduce stress intake,</p>
<p>or you can increase recovery capacity, right?</p>
<p>What we want in an ideal situation</p>
<p>is to be able to implement the most stress possible,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the driver of adaptation.</p>
<p>Recover from that.</p>
<p>Now we get the most adaptation,</p>
<p>and adaptation being simply a change,</p>
<p>whatever change you want it to be.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our gold standard, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pie in the eye.</p>
<p>Some people have endogenous differences.</p>
<p>They just recover better.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>There are genetic factors,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s talk about the ones that are manipulatable.</p>
<p>If we go to the stress side of it,</p>
<p>you want the throttle to be pushed</p>
<p>as far down on the ones you want stress from,</p>
<p>and as far off of the ones you don&rsquo;t want stress,</p>
<p>so that the adaptation comes in the exact area you want,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not burning gas</p>
<p>in something you don&rsquo;t care about,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re taking that total stress bucket too high.</p>
<p>Recovery capacity over there.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s how you can do that.</p>
<p>You can run some analytics</p>
<p>and measure what we do with everyone</p>
<p>through these very comprehensive breakdowns</p>
<p>to figure out what&rsquo;s that physiology look like</p>
<p>hidden and visible,</p>
<p>and then what&rsquo;s the recovery capacity.</p>
<p>Once we have that blueprint,</p>
<p>we can now figure out</p>
<p>what are the two or three things we need to track</p>
<p>that are these indicators</p>
<p>of what we call performance anchors.</p>
<p>So an anchor is something</p>
<p>that kind of drags behind you or below you</p>
<p>that slows you down.</p>
<p>The analogy being,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;re going down</p>
<p>one of these amazing canyon roads,</p>
<p>and I won&rsquo;t say which canyon we&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>so you can stay hidden here.</p>
<p>And your car is going down at a certain velocity,</p>
<p>and you want to go faster.</p>
<p>Most people&rsquo;s first impulse is to hit the gas,</p>
<p>the accelerator.</p>
<p>We want to push.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s fine,</p>
<p>but if your foot is on the brake</p>
<p>and you push the accelerator,</p>
<p>you might go a little bit faster,</p>
<p>but number one,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re wasting a lot of literal gas</p>
<p>to go a little bit faster,</p>
<p>and two, you&rsquo;re burning your engine.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to blow.</p>
<p>The easier solution is just take your foot off the brake.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to go faster by just stopping yourself.</p>
<p>Then if that&rsquo;s not fast enough,</p>
<p>we can hit the accelerator.</p>
<p>Everyone wants to just push down, right?</p>
<p>More stimulus, more optimization,</p>
<p>bing, bing, bing, bing here.</p>
<p>Our first analytics are,</p>
<p>where are these performance anchors?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s dragging you back?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s putting down the brake?</p>
<p>I want to move those two or three things out of the way,</p>
<p>and now let&rsquo;s see how far you get.</p>
<p>Oh, look at that.</p>
<p>Your recovery capacity has gone way up.</p>
<p>Your adaptations are happening faster now,</p>
<p>or we can do more work because you&rsquo;re recovering quicker.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re trying to figure out in those buckets,</p>
<p>and we have a whole host of things</p>
<p>that we measure, biomarkers and surveys</p>
<p>and everything else that we go through</p>
<p>to find out what&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>So after we&rsquo;ve done that,</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re just going to track a few</p>
<p>of those recovery markers along the way</p>
<p>to figure out what&rsquo;s globally happening.</p>
<p>So that could mean grip strength.</p>
<p>I have some folks who are going to test grip strength daily.</p>
<p>Others, we&rsquo;re going to look at HRV or combinations.</p>
<p>We may look at performance metrics like a force plate.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to do a vertical jump every single day,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to see where that&rsquo;s at.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve used the tap test before,</p>
<p>which is how many times you can tap your finger</p>
<p>as fast as possible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a rough indicator of central nervous system.</p>
<p>In a, say, one-minute interval.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s just apps you can do on this.</p>
<p>Like, you tap his finger as fast as you can.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to say, hey, you did 60 taps today,</p>
<p>and your average is 75.</p>
<p>I like that because it taps into,</p>
<p>ha, no pun intended, into upper motor neuron capacity.</p>
<p>Because a lot of things, like grip strength,</p>
<p>obviously I have to send the deliberate signal</p>
<p>to my hand to grip,</p>
<p>but at some point, the lower motor neurons</p>
<p>are going to be taking over the majority of the work.</p>
<p>Like, the signal is probably one and done,</p>
<p>whereas tapping is going to be repetitive</p>
<p>sending of signals from upper motor neurons.</p>
<p>Yep, so some of the athletes I work with,</p>
<p>we track blood every day.</p>
<p>We track urine every day.</p>
<p>We track, ideally, a combination</p>
<p>of subjective and objective measures.</p>
<p>Everything from how did you feel last night</p>
<p>to environmental sensors of their bedroom,</p>
<p>full PSGs going on, running actual sleep diagnostics,</p>
<p>not an aura ring, nothing against aura,</p>
<p>but full analytics.</p>
<p>And some of them, it&rsquo;s as simple as,</p>
<p>how&rsquo;d you feel today, and what was your vertical jump?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to put people in a position to succeed.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to figure out what&rsquo;s the lever</p>
<p>that they need to pull,</p>
<p>as well as what&rsquo;s their aptitude,</p>
<p>what sport are they in,</p>
<p>what can we realistically get away with?</p>
<p>And some of them will take machines with them,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll do blood every day,</p>
<p>and urine, and all kinds of stuff.</p>
<p>And some of them, it&rsquo;s a lot lower.</p>
<p>For myself, I&rsquo;m not, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of devices.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to wear the wristwatch.</p>
<p>I tend to go off feel,</p>
<p>which is not, it&rsquo;s not the ideal,</p>
<p>objective way to gauge things.</p>
<p>But part of my reasoning for this is my colleague</p>
<p>from the psychology department, Dr. Aaliyah Crum,</p>
<p>has done some studies where they&rsquo;ve given,</p>
<p>deliberately given people false feedback about their sleep.</p>
<p>So told people you didn&rsquo;t sleep very well,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ve told people you slept really well.</p>
<p>And performance can be driven in the expected direction</p>
<p>based on feedback,</p>
<p>independent of how well people slept or didn&rsquo;t sleep.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can take someone</p>
<p>that only slept two hours or was up every 30 seconds</p>
<p>because of apnea and tell them they slept great,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to perform great cognitive tasks.</p>
<p>But you can take someone who slept very well,</p>
<p>tell them that their recovery quotient wasn&rsquo;t very good,</p>
<p>and their output is going to be worse.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s my concern about a lot of devices out there,</p>
<p>not to name specific devices,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still unclear to the general public</p>
<p>what the specific algorithms are</p>
<p>to generate these recovery scores, right?</p>
<p>And so many of the things that reportedly track sleep</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t tracking sleep,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re tracking heart rate and breathing,</p>
<p>which are correlates of sleep depth, but that&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m not knocking those.</p>
<p>I think the sleep trackers, if nothing else,</p>
<p>have provided a forum</p>
<p>whereby people are very conscious of getting good sleep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like knowing the total caloric intake</p>
<p>of your food, people go,</p>
<p>wow, I&rsquo;m actually eating a lot more than I thought.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s calibration.</p>
<p>Or less in some cases, but often the case is that it&rsquo;s more.</p>
<p>So I think for the typical person,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering whether or not, like myself,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not a competitive athlete</p>
<p>or certainly not a professional athlete,</p>
<p>competitive with myself, I suppose, but no one else.</p>
<p>Morning pulse rate, I tend to take when I&rsquo;m waking.</p>
<p>If I wake out of a really stressful dream,</p>
<p>I might relax a little bit</p>
<p>and then just take my pulse rate, kind of get a range</p>
<p>and see if it&rsquo;s spiking for whatever reason.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t tend to measure grip strength,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;ve heard you can just use a classic scale,</p>
<p>old-fashioned scale with the NeoNow, old-fashioned,</p>
<p>or some other more technical device is probably good.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a low-cost one.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re all low-cost.</p>
<p>And then the carbon dioxide tolerance test.</p>
<p>So we haven&rsquo;t really talked about that in specific ways.</p>
<p>My understanding of it is it&rsquo;s four deep, slow breaths,</p>
<p>in through the nose, out through the nose,</p>
<p>and then a big inhale as max exhale,</p>
<p>and then time duration of exhale through the nose,</p>
<p>and then stopping the stopwatch</p>
<p>at the point where lungs are empty,</p>
<p>not necessarily as long as one could hold their breath.</p>
<p>Did I get that right?</p>
<p>Pretty much.</p>
<p>I guess we should credit you and Brian McKenzie.</p>
<p>Yeah, those guys.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the folks under Brian&rsquo;s umbrella</p>
<p>for really establishing this as a really good metric.</p>
<p>When and how can I use the carbon dioxide tolerance test</p>
<p>to gauge recovery?</p>
<p>Upon waking, post-training session?</p>
<p>Yeah. Would that be a good time?</p>
<p>Number one answer is whatever you do, be consistent.</p>
<p>So do it under any good science experiment.</p>
<p>Do it under the exact same conditions as you can.</p>
<p>That generally means somewhere in the morning,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re probably going to have</p>
<p>the most control, most stability going.</p>
<p>So yeah, like you would take any HRV or other metric,</p>
<p>wake up, get under control, get stabilized,</p>
<p>take your metric.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be pretty good.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Sodium bicarb, leaking soda.</p>
<p>Rumor has it, and data has it,</p>
<p>that it can actually be a pretty effective training tool.</p>
<p>Very effective.</p>
<p>Could you explain a little bit about how it works</p>
<p>and how one might explore using sodium bicarb</p>
<p>to enhance training output in a couple of different contexts?</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&rsquo;s a handful of these</p>
<p>ubiquitously effective supplements for performance.</p>
<p>Sodium bicarbonate&rsquo;s one of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very ingenious idea, because it&rsquo;s so simple.</p>
<p>Effectively, muscle contraction happens</p>
<p>because enzymatic function occurs</p>
<p>within a fairly specific pH range, right?</p>
<p>So if it gets extremely acidic, it doesn&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>And so whether you&rsquo;re running through aerobic glycolysis</p>
<p>or anaerobic or anything else,</p>
<p>all of these things require,</p>
<p>even ATP hydrolysis requires ATPase.</p>
<p>An enzyme has to,</p>
<p>the enzymes don&rsquo;t function well</p>
<p>outside of this fairly special range.</p>
<p>So what happens is generally fatigue,</p>
<p>the sensations of fatigue are actually caused</p>
<p>by some signal that, hey, we&rsquo;re starting to run out of pH,</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re getting in the wrong range.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not out of gas usually.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not too low on oxygen.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not running low on muscle glycogen yet.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re typically gonna see signs</p>
<p>or feel signals of fatigue way prior to that,</p>
<p>mostly being pH issues.</p>
<p>That being said, what if we could regulate pH better?</p>
<p>Enter bicarbonate, right?</p>
<p>So without going too far into metabolism,</p>
<p>effectively what happens is you take an inhale</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re mostly breathing in oxygen, O2.</p>
<p>When you exhale, you&rsquo;re breathing out CO2.</p>
<p>So the difference is you&rsquo;ve gained a carbon somehow.</p>
<p>Well, all of your carbohydrates in your body</p>
<p>come in the form of long carbon chains.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s what a carbohydrate means.</p>
<p>It is a one carbon molecule</p>
<p>that has one water molecule attached.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a carbon that has been hydrated.</p>
<p>In the case of like glucose, blood sugar,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a six carbon molecule, right?</p>
<p>In terms of fat, which are the only two places</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get most of your cellular energy,</p>
<p>carbohydrates and fat,</p>
<p>that is also a big long block and chain of carbons.</p>
<p>So whether you&rsquo;re getting your energy</p>
<p>from fat or carbohydrate,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to split those atoms.</p>
<p>So in other words, you&rsquo;ve got six carbons</p>
<p>attached to each other.</p>
<p>And in this part of chemistry, it&rsquo;s exergonic.</p>
<p>So when you break that carbon bond,</p>
<p>so break one of those carbons off from the other,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to release energy.</p>
<p>Just like if you had a pencil in here and I snapped it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d go bang and pop.</p>
<p>I broke the bonds that were connecting that graphite</p>
<p>to the next piece of graphite and that released energy</p>
<p>because I put energy in the system, et cetera.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>As a result though, we&rsquo;ve now had, you know,</p>
<p>say five or six carbons chained together.</p>
<p>We broke one off the end, which is not how it works,</p>
<p>but making the point.</p>
<p>And now you have one free floating carbon.</p>
<p>You use that energy release to then go make ATP,</p>
<p>to then go make your muscles contract.</p>
<p>But now you&rsquo;ve got carbon floating around.</p>
<p>You can associate free floating carbon</p>
<p>with being at a higher acidic level.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p>
<p>The only way that you&rsquo;re going to go through this process</p>
<p>is if your body says,</p>
<p>do we have an oxygen molecule available</p>
<p>that we can bind this to immediately?</p>
<p>Yes, we do.</p>
<p>That carbon attaches to that oxygen molecule.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just put CO2 in the blood</p>
<p>because of what we just talked about.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to bind it through this bicarbonate process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to go through your blood.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to go into the lungs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to go back into its carbon dioxide molecule.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to go through the alveoli into the lungs</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to exhale.</p>
<p>So you went from carbon to this bicarbonate system,</p>
<p>back into carbon, exhale.</p>
<p>So inhaled O2 plants go the opposite, by the way.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re going to breathe in the CO2.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to cleave off that carbon,</p>
<p>stack those carbons together,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how they get larger in your blood.</p>
<p>Those six carbon chains are called glucose.</p>
<p>If we store that in your muscle, we call it glycogen.</p>
<p>So we take a bunch of glucose and stack it together</p>
<p>in a plant.</p>
<p>We call that starch.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s effectively what it is, right?</p>
<p>So you take a bunch of carbon from the atmosphere,</p>
<p>stack it all together, and that&rsquo;s a starch.</p>
<p>If you want to do it in the form of fruit,</p>
<p>we take that starch like from the ground,</p>
<p>you put it up through the tree,</p>
<p>go all the way up to the top, put it into the flower,</p>
<p>break it up into these big, huge chunks of starch</p>
<p>into little forms called fructose or glucose.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why fruit has fructose in it</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why tubers and stuff have starch in them.</p>
<p>Basically starch in an animal is glycogen in us.</p>
<p>Okay, all that to say, if that&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>and we know that a byproduct specifically</p>
<p>of anaerobic glycolysis,</p>
<p>meaning the breakdown of carbohydrates for fuel,</p>
<p>typically in a very fast pace</p>
<p>with low oxygen availability,</p>
<p>the downside of that equation is acid production.</p>
<p>We know that that&rsquo;s a problem</p>
<p>because I started the conversation off there intentionally.</p>
<p>So what if we could reduce the acid buildup?</p>
<p>Now, you know how pH kind of works.</p>
<p>I went and kind of double negatives there, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want too much acid buildup.</p>
<p>Then could we prolong and sustain energy</p>
<p>in a more effective pace,</p>
<p>especially in this anaerobic interval kind of environment?</p>
<p>And again, that&rsquo;s important because in those things,</p>
<p>failure is not a result of running out of fuel or oxygen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a result of fatigue building up way too quickly.</p>
<p>Is that also true for resistance training?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s maybe more of the creatine phosphate system.</p>
<p>That can be an issue.</p>
<p>It could simply be an issue of force production.</p>
<p>You just don&rsquo;t have enough force.</p>
<p>At least you&rsquo;re not out of energy.</p>
<p>You just can&rsquo;t muster enough force.</p>
<p>You do enough reps, then it&rsquo;s gonna be an issue there.</p>
<p>Creatine phosphate would be the big winner, depending.</p>
<p>So to come back a little bit to the beginning,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m circling this all together intentionally.</p>
<p>All right, well, the way that we produce energy</p>
<p>is gonna be in two primary categories,</p>
<p>anaerobic, anaerobic aerobic,</p>
<p>meaning with oxygen, anaerobic, meaning without.</p>
<p>In terms of muscle contraction,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re pretty much talking about carbohydrates or fat.</p>
<p>Now, fat is going to be exclusively aerobic,</p>
<p>meaning I&rsquo;m gonna use fat from the entire body,</p>
<p>roughly equally.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re doing a sprint up a hill,</p>
<p>and your hamstrings or your glutes or your quads are on fire.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not just going to use the fat</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s directly in those hamstrings.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna lose it from the entire body.</p>
<p>It has to go through lipolysis,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s in a stored form in adipose tissue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotta get broken down and put into blood.</p>
<p>Blood&rsquo;s gonna have to go through your body,</p>
<p>get taken up into muscle,</p>
<p>taken up through muscle into the mitochondria.</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;re gonna have to go through this process</p>
<p>called beta-oxidation.</p>
<p>So remember, carbohydrates and glucose especially</p>
<p>is a six-carbon molecule.</p>
<p>Fat, if it&rsquo;s in the form of a triglyceride,</p>
<p>it is a three-carbon glycerol backbone</p>
<p>and three, you know, tri, one, two, three, fatty acids.</p>
<p>Three-carbon backbone and those fatty acids</p>
<p>are just big, long chains of carbon.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all it is, right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna break that thing down, put it in the blood,</p>
<p>move it up, move it into our mitochondria.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t walk those things across the mitochondria</p>
<p>while they&rsquo;re too big.</p>
<p>So what you have to do is cleave them off</p>
<p>into little chunks, and it turns out we break them off</p>
<p>into two carbon chunks, so we call it beta, as in two.</p>
<p>Move those into mitochondria.</p>
<p>That can go through this little thing called Krebs cycle</p>
<p>or triaxylic acid cycle,</p>
<p>and you kick out a bunch of energy out of that.</p>
<p>You had two carbons, so as a result of that process,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna generate two carbon dioxides.</p>
<p>But remember, you can only go through that process</p>
<p>if oxygen is available because you have to be able</p>
<p>to place those carbons onto something</p>
<p>or acid gets up way too high too fast.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why fat is a nice fuel source,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very slow.</p>
<p>It takes physical time to move</p>
<p>from the back of your shoulder into your blood,</p>
<p>down your hamstring, uptake, uptake, uptake.</p>
<p>In addition, it&rsquo;s required oxygen availability.</p>
<p>If you need energy faster,</p>
<p>you simply don&rsquo;t have the time to bring in the oxygen,</p>
<p>transport it through, go through capillaries,</p>
<p>exchange through tissue, et cetera.</p>
<p>Carbohydrate, on the other hand,</p>
<p>is gonna be stored locally in the exercising muscle cell</p>
<p>and specifically in the cytoplasm.</p>
<p>As glycogen.</p>
<p>As glycogen in the store there.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s gonna happen initially,</p>
<p>your initial demands for fuel are gonna come</p>
<p>from the glycogen stored within the muscle fiber itself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just gonna break right there</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna be off the races.</p>
<p>So you have the six carbon molecule,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna break it into two separate</p>
<p>three carbon molecules.</p>
<p>Okay, boom, that breaking provides you</p>
<p>a tiny bit of energy.</p>
<p>Very small but some.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re gonna take those two three carbon molecules</p>
<p>and you wanna be able to oxidize them</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s your only next step.</p>
<p>But in order to do that,</p>
<p>you gotta go those into mitochondria.</p>
<p>So you gotta break one of those molecules off</p>
<p>so then you&rsquo;ll be back to your two carbon molecule</p>
<p>just like you did with fat.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna go into mitochondria</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s gonna go through the exact same Krebs cycle,</p>
<p>two carbons, et cetera.</p>
<p>But hold on.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have sufficient oxygen</p>
<p>or sufficient mitochondrial availability</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re stuck at that two three carbon place,</p>
<p>what do you do?</p>
<p>You have problems, right?</p>
<p>Now we have to say, okay, wait a minute.</p>
<p>We have a three carbon molecule</p>
<p>and we have a bunch of this acid buildup.</p>
<p>Now acid functionally is hydrogen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what pH, potential hydrogen</p>
<p>is what pH stands for, right?</p>
<p>So if hydrogen is building up</p>
<p>as a byproduct of muscular contraction</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re having this three carbon molecule,</p>
<p>what it can actually do is grab one of those hydrogens.</p>
<p>And those three carbon molecules, by the way,</p>
<p>are called pyruvate or pyruvic acid, right?</p>
<p>If you take a pyruvic acid and you grab hydrogen,</p>
<p>put it on top of it, we now have a different name for it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called?</p>
<p>Hydrogen peroxide.</p>
<p>Lactate.</p>
<p>Bingo, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what lactate or lactic acid is, right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve now built that up.</p>
<p>So number one reason why lactate&rsquo;s not causing you fatigue,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually preventing it</p>
<p>and then it does a bunch of other really cool stuff.</p>
<p>But the point is that system can only last so long.</p>
<p>That gets overwhelmed very quickly.</p>
<p>What are you going to do with the rest of this hydrogen?</p>
<p>Well, if you started off in a normal pH range,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have very far to go</p>
<p>before you&rsquo;ve now gone into that level of too much acidity.</p>
<p>If you start off in a more basic,</p>
<p>and basic I don&rsquo;t mean simple,</p>
<p>I mean chemistry, right?</p>
<p>And more alkaline,</p>
<p>then that same amount of increase in pH is no longer,</p>
<p>now just puts you back in your physiological range.</p>
<p>So sodium bicarbonate,</p>
<p>whether taken as a cream, or a powder,</p>
<p>or baking soda, or anything else,</p>
<p>can simply put you in a more alkaline state even acutely.</p>
<p>So this is something you can take</p>
<p>right now before your workout.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to delay,</p>
<p>what we call delay the progression of fatigue.</p>
<p>And how would people start to approach this practice?</p>
<p>My understanding is you can do this</p>
<p>with common store-bought baking soda.</p>
<p>No question.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always a concern about gastric distress,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a very effective laxative.</p>
<p>Sometimes an unwanted laxative effect.</p>
<p>But how would one approach this before?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m going to,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing the mile repeats exercise.</p>
<p>Mile repeats protocol that we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing that for a few months,</p>
<p>and now I want to try the sodium bicarb.</p>
<p>Approach I&rsquo;m well hydrated,</p>
<p>hopefully I&rsquo;m well rested.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready to go.</p>
<p>When am I going to drink this sodium bicarb solution?</p>
<p>How would I make the solution?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I take 10 ounces of water.</p>
<p>How much bicarb do I want to,</p>
<p>sodium bicarb should I put in there?</p>
<p>Can we come up with it?</p>
<p>Is it half a teaspoon?</p>
<p>Is it a teaspoon?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to tell you.</p>
<p>You will thank me by starting lower.</p>
<p>You can always go more later.</p>
<p>So a little pinch.</p>
<p>You cannot go backwards.</p>
<p>How about I start with a quarter teaspoon?</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Honestly, half is fine.</p>
<p>Half a teaspoon.</p>
<p>Totally fine.</p>
<p>Dissolve that.</p>
<p>Slug that down.</p>
<p>I read a study recently that showed</p>
<p>that people will hit the peak benefits of this</p>
<p>at different times,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s somewhere, if memory serves me correctly,</p>
<p>somewhere between 60 and 90 minutes later.</p>
<p>So I might want to drink it on the way to the track.</p>
<p>It can.</p>
<p>It can be as low as 20.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So maybe as I get to the track,</p>
<p>since I&rsquo;m going to do some warmup</p>
<p>with some walking, jogging.</p>
<p>I say 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a very rough standard.</p>
<p>But yeah, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>It is individualized.</p>
<p>And you probably want to play with that a little bit.</p>
<p>If not, just somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 to an hour.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And then the perceived and real fatigue,</p>
<p>if done correctly,</p>
<p>the perceived and real fatigue ought to be reduced.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I can do more work without feeling exhausted.</p>
<p>Will I feel less of a lactate burn?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Done in air quotes for those listening.</p>
<p>I realize that&rsquo;s a very crude way</p>
<p>to describe a complex physiological process.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>Can sodium bicarb be used repeatedly</p>
<p>for longer duration training?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to use it with weight training</p>
<p>for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m doing circuit type training</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m doing the super set type strength training</p>
<p>that you talked about before.</p>
<p>Push, pull, push, pull,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s a little bit more cardiovascularly demanding.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Then maybe I&rsquo;d sip that throughout the workout.</p>
<p>Make sure there&rsquo;s a bathroom nearby.</p>
<p>It sounds like,</p>
<p>because I do,</p>
<p>I am aware that many people</p>
<p>get pretty serious gastric distress.</p>
<p>It can happen very quickly.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Well, it sounds like an amazing training tool.</p>
<p>I really appreciate you sharing it.</p>
<p>Because I think it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one that doesn&rsquo;t get a lot of airtime these days,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s been around,</p>
<p>but sounds like it has some pretty impressive effects.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know what&rsquo;s sort of funny about that is,</p>
<p>I mean, I get it.</p>
<p>Pop culture is what it is,</p>
<p>but still to this day,</p>
<p>if you want to talk about sort of your most effective</p>
<p>general health slash performance supplementation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same three to four to five.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because they work really well.</p>
<p>Without going into the chemistry of each one</p>
<p>and the practice of each one,</p>
<p>because I definitely want to get you back</p>
<p>to talk about diet, nutrition, and supplementation.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>At some point.</p>
<p>I think we need a full couple of hours to get that right,</p>
<p>at least.</p>
<p>If you, as a teaser,</p>
<p>would you mind just listing off the other supplements</p>
<p>that you have found are very effective for many people?</p>
<p>So sodium bicarb or baking soda is one.</p>
<p>What are some of the other ones?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll go kind of a reverse order.</p>
<p>Beta alanine is another very classically effective one.</p>
<p>Similar idea of sodium bicarbonate.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going to,</p>
<p>beta alanine is going to come in</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to be converted and stored</p>
<p>as what&rsquo;s called carnosine in the muscle.</p>
<p>And carnosine is an intracellular buffer.</p>
<p>So in other words,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just going to delay the buildup of acid.</p>
<p>So fatigue blocker, if you will.</p>
<p>So very effective, very cheap, very safe, well-studied.</p>
<p>The top one though, of all of them by far,</p>
<p>that has an incredibly strong safety profile.</p>
<p>It has, it is a cheap, it is a simple form to get,</p>
<p>has a important magnitude of effect</p>
<p>and is effective across multiple domains</p>
<p>of physical health and performance.</p>
<p>And it is, because of that, it is my crown jewel.</p>
<p>It is, in my opinion, without question,</p>
<p>the Michael Jordan of all supplementation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s creatine monohydrate.</p>
<p>It affects so many things.</p>
<p>We typically think about it as it&rsquo;s muscle stuff, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked kind of,</p>
<p>you quickly were talking about</p>
<p>the creatine phosphate system.</p>
<p>But we have to realize the mass majority of research</p>
<p>on creatine phosphate is not in sport performance</p>
<p>and has not been for 20 years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in clinical.</p>
<p>And it has everything from effects</p>
<p>on the neurological system</p>
<p>to there have been associations</p>
<p>to mental health and depression.</p>
<p>And to be very clear, I am certainly not saying</p>
<p>you can take creatine and cure anything.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s gonna stop you</p>
<p>from depression or anything,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m saying there&rsquo;s a lot of research in these areas</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a reason people are doing it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I completely agree.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re willing, I&rsquo;d love to have you back</p>
<p>for us to do a discussion on creatine and the brain</p>
<p>or creatine and the nervous system.</p>
<p>That would be a lot of fun</p>
<p>and maybe we can do a kind of a journal club</p>
<p>in advance of that.</p>
<p>For those that don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>a journal club is where scientists read a bunch of papers</p>
<p>and then argue about them, discuss them,</p>
<p>and try and extract the kind of agreed upon center of mass,</p>
<p>if you will.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve long been taking five grams</p>
<p>of creatine monohydrate per day</p>
<p>for mainly for the cognitive effects.</p>
<p>I sense an effect.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s obviously anecdata,</p>
<p>but I think there are a lot of data out there</p>
<p>as you alluded to.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s enough, you&rsquo;re not crazy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s enough there.</p>
<p>And in fact, there&rsquo;s enough mechanism now</p>
<p>to understand the metabolic needs.</p>
<p>People think I&rsquo;m a muscle guy, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna think about the metabolism needed</p>
<p>to fuel muscle.</p>
<p>But we forget cells, immune cells, red blood cells,</p>
<p>nerve cells, astrocytes, brain,</p>
<p>all this stuff requires energy</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all going through metabolism.</p>
<p>Super interesting.</p>
<p>We will do the deep dive on that soon.</p>
<p>I have a final question for you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re involved in a really interesting,</p>
<p>I think really cutting edge project</p>
<p>that I first learned about from you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know of anyone else doing anything</p>
<p>as forward thinking and frankly,</p>
<p>as relevant to the general population</p>
<p>because of my interest in people getting better sleep</p>
<p>and learning how to do that,</p>
<p>avoiding stress and learning how to do that.</p>
<p>Tell us a little bit about what I believe</p>
<p>is called absolute rest.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So this is something that we&rsquo;ve been playing</p>
<p>with behind the scenes for a long time.</p>
<p>And this is typically how high performance stuff works,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>People want exclusivity and so this has been built.</p>
<p>Effectively, what happened is a friend of mine,</p>
<p>Cody Burkhart, I don&rsquo;t know if you know Cody,</p>
<p>but a famous-</p>
<p>Down in Texas.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, NASA.</p>
<p>NASA guy.</p>
<p>Yeah, I do know Cody.</p>
<p>Wonderful, just down the road thinker.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s interested in sleep, right?</p>
<p>And for forever, I would cover using with athletes,</p>
<p>but everything available tells you how you&rsquo;re sleeping.</p>
<p>Nothing can tell you why you&rsquo;re sleeping that way.</p>
<p>And so we got together in Boulder</p>
<p>and then I met some of his former colleagues,</p>
<p>computer science folks, Harvard MD,</p>
<p>and some really impressive tech folks.</p>
<p>And we were just thinking about an idea</p>
<p>and we came up with,</p>
<p>we started to realize the problems, right?</p>
<p>We use first principle thinking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of my favorite approaches.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with that, go Google that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a recipe to solve problems,</p>
<p>this first principle thinking.</p>
<p>And we just started to think about like,</p>
<p>man, all the sleep tech is there, it&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to convince people that they need sleep.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s done that.</p>
<p>You need high quality sleep,</p>
<p>but how can I provide solutions?</p>
<p>And with the people I work with,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t just tell them your testosterone&rsquo;s down</p>
<p>or your sleep&rsquo;s down or recover.</p>
<p>I need to be able to be like, this is down and here&rsquo;s why,</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s our solution.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how our high-performance world works.</p>
<p>So enter absolute rest.</p>
<p>This is saying, okay, what are the actual nodes</p>
<p>that go into high-effective, high-quality sleep?</p>
<p>Number one is psychology.</p>
<p>So there has to be some sort of screening diagnostic</p>
<p>for are you not sleeping because of simply</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t control yourself?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve done a wonderful job of giving people tools.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t quiet your mind before sleep, do this.</p>
<p>If you wake up and you can&rsquo;t go back to sleep,</p>
<p>here are a bunch of things, right?</p>
<p>So we have some screens that we can do</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some other stuff we can do to analyze.</p>
<p>This is a psychological issue.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re under control and we have different tricks we use</p>
<p>and stuff on Gym Hack we talk about, but it&rsquo;s not that.</p>
<p>Okay, is it physiology?</p>
<p>Which is node number two.</p>
<p>Do we know what your dopamine levels are like?</p>
<p>Do we know what your serotonin levels are like?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s melatonin look like?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s adrenaline?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s cortisol?</p>
<p>Cortisol being the primary driver.</p>
<p>What is this relationship, DHEA?</p>
<p>Where are these things at?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna measure all that and track that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna measure that during the day, prior to sleep.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna measure that next morning</p>
<p>and even sometimes throughout sleep.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re gonna figure out is this a physiology problem?</p>
<p>If it is, then we have clear corrections.</p>
<p>If not, we&rsquo;re gonna go on to the next step,</p>
<p>which is, is this possibly a pathology?</p>
<p>So you have some sort of sleep disorder.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna run full, what&rsquo;s called PSG,</p>
<p>so polysomnography, a full,</p>
<p>the exact same stuff you would get in a sleep clinic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sensor that&rsquo;s gonna go on measuring EEG and EOG</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna have a muscle activation sensor</p>
<p>to see if your legs are moving</p>
<p>and everything else is going on.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re gonna get a full diagnostic.</p>
<p>And if anyone&rsquo;s ever done this,</p>
<p>the amount of sleep issues that are happening in people</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t even realize is extraordinarily high.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna figure this out.</p>
<p>One very quick example,</p>
<p>we just did this with a professional athlete</p>
<p>and he was having like 280,</p>
<p>roughly, of these episodes per night.</p>
<p>And to be categorized as an episode,</p>
<p>you have to meet these four specific criteria,</p>
<p>oxygen saturation, ventilation changes,</p>
<p>brain changes, et cetera.</p>
<p>And he hit that over 280 times a night.</p>
<p>And what this technology allowed us to do</p>
<p>is figure out what position did all these things occur in?</p>
<p>Well, in his particular case,</p>
<p>what most of them were happening was on his back.</p>
<p>And so we bought a very simple like pillow, basically,</p>
<p>that went on his back,</p>
<p>that kept him from sleeping on his back.</p>
<p>And we saw an 85% reduction in sleep awakeness issues</p>
<p>the very first night.</p>
<p>Now we did that,</p>
<p>testosterone eventually tripled after three months</p>
<p>by just improving sleep.</p>
<p>And all we did is move him onto his left or right side.</p>
<p>So huge improvements just by understanding</p>
<p>where the problem occurred and why it occurred there.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have to change hardly anything else.</p>
<p>He had the basic hygiene stuff down</p>
<p>and temperature and all that stuff.</p>
<p>And he had his chili pad and all that to keep the thing cool.</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t fix it.</p>
<p>Years, by the way, this took us two years</p>
<p>of just trying everything.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like, man.</p>
<p>And it was just like, I wish,</p>
<p>wish we could get you to sleep better.</p>
<p>And I pulled out every trick I knew.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, as soon as we built this down,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh my God, it&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not overweight, by the way.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t have any, he&rsquo;s not iron deficient.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t have any of these other classical symptoms</p>
<p>that are associated with bad sleep.</p>
<p>Supplementation, everything.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done a thousand protocols.</p>
<p>That fixed it overnight.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s not psychology and it&rsquo;s not physiology</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not pathology,</p>
<p>then the last one that people don&rsquo;t have any idea about</p>
<p>is environment.</p>
<p>And so what you don&rsquo;t realize is we have a box.</p>
<p>We can sit right next to your bed.</p>
<p>You just plug it in.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to do anything.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s gonna run full environmental scans.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s gonna look at the temperature in your room.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna look at the humidity in your room.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna look at the volatile organic acids.</p>
<p>These are things that are seeping out from your mattress.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna look at particulates in the air</p>
<p>and possible allergens and things that are floating around</p>
<p>that are closing your nose off so you can&rsquo;t sleep at night.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re mouth breathing and you&rsquo;ve talked a lot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure on the previous episodes about why that&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna look at your CO2 cloud.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve talked, we&rsquo;ve already set this point up, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re inhaling O2, but then you&rsquo;re exhaling CO2.</p>
<p>Well, during the day and when we&rsquo;re conversing,</p>
<p>you have quite a bit of force with that exhalation, right?</p>
<p>But at night,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just barely seeping out of your mouth.</p>
<p>So what happens is CO2 sends to cloud up</p>
<p>and build around your face.</p>
<p>And then you end up re-breathing that CO2.</p>
<p>And this can cause a large number of sleep problems</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re simply re-breathing in the panic.</p>
<p>Whether you fully awake or just kick out of a sleep stage,</p>
<p>the CO2 around your face is a big issue.</p>
<p>This stuff has all been known, by the way,</p>
<p>with the astronauts for a very long time.</p>
<p>It just hasn&rsquo;t translated into the commercial spaces.</p>
<p>Of course, gone to our high performer space.</p>
<p>So we can measure that as well.</p>
<p>And then we can figure out like for the most extreme,</p>
<p>we can actually come into a bedroom</p>
<p>and build an entire sleep optimization setup</p>
<p>and control the entire thing.</p>
<p>But for most folks, the minimum we can do</p>
<p>is run full diagnostics and check off,</p>
<p>is this environmental related?</p>
<p>Is it pathology?</p>
<p>Is there something else?</p>
<p>So is this a commercial device</p>
<p>that people can eventually access?</p>
<p>It is now.</p>
<p>So where can people learn more about Absolute Rest?</p>
<p>AbsoluteRest.com.</p>
<p>Very cool.</p>
<p>And just for our full disclosure,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t aware that you had done this prior to today,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;d mentioned.</p>
<p>I always like to ask people, scientists or otherwise,</p>
<p>I always love to ask,</p>
<p>you know, what are you most excited about lately?</p>
<p>And this sounds like an amazing technology.</p>
<p>And just to be really clear,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not like something we&rsquo;re working on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s landed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s landed.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re ready to go.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Well, and that&rsquo;s one of the things I appreciate about you</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re willing to sometimes speculate,</p>
<p>but you always say it&rsquo;s speculation.</p>
<p>But in general, you seem like the kind of guy</p>
<p>where if you&rsquo;re going to be public facing about something,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to make a statement,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s got to be quite a bit behind it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to allude to the in 10 years,</p>
<p>we might be able to do this or in five years.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very data-driven kind of guy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, the people I work with, we need answers, right?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have that timeframe.</p>
<p>And we typically have like,</p>
<p>hey, we start the season in four weeks.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s just where I&rsquo;m at.</p>
<p>Well, as I said, I appreciate that about you,</p>
<p>but it is, but one of the many things I appreciate,</p>
<p>I think the listeners and I can well appreciate</p>
<p>on the basis of today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>what a enormous wealth of information you are,</p>
<p>how clear and potently you communicate that information.</p>
<p>And also how you can take a huge cloud of information</p>
<p>and still distill it into protocols</p>
<p>that ought to work for 75% of people, 75% of the time,</p>
<p>which is an immensely valuable thing to do.</p>
<p>So for me and from the listeners,</p>
<p>I just want to say thank you so much</p>
<p>for taking the several now hours.</p>
<p>I lose track of time, which reflects all good things.</p>
<p>Several hours to take a break from teaching,</p>
<p>take a break from research,</p>
<p>take a break from the other important commitments</p>
<p>of your life and really share with us</p>
<p>all this incredible information.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so, so grateful.</p>
<p>My pleasure, man.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad we finally got to connect.</p>
<p>This has been a long time in the making.</p>
<p>It has.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to bring the breathing protocols to my training.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to start doing more of the endurance type</p>
<p>and interval type training.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to start moving when I do heat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to start moving when I do cold.</p>
<p>I might even start throwing some sodium bicarb</p>
<p>into a very small amount of sodium bicarb</p>
<p>into some water before I train.</p>
<p>And listen, Andy, Professor Andy Galpin,</p>
