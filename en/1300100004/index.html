    <p>no sound is this song</p>
<p>jesus fucking christ</p>
<p>i should have known i couldn&rsquo;t hear myself</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s record on here so the replays</p>
<p>the replays will have it nobody wants to</p>
<p>watch the replays god damn it</p>
<p>what is recap what a</p>
<p>hilarious clusterfuck</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>meet that meet the audio</p>
<p>why am i beating the audio</p>
<p>because you hear me</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s recap what we were talking about</p>
<p>well i&rsquo;m very upset here</p>
<p>i just said some</p>
<p>genius shit probably</p>
<p>the most profound shit i&rsquo;ve ever said in my life</p>
<p>anyway what</p>
<p>i said in the beginning the very beginning was that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m excited to do these</p>
<p>you stream broadcasts and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>excited that i decided to do it because</p>
<p>i like doing</p>
<p>radio interviews</p>
<p>i like doing tv interviews and that&rsquo;s all fun</p>
<p>magazine stuff is fun but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s way cool to just be able to</p>
<p>talk to people and answer people&rsquo;s questions directly</p>
<p>you know and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to get a weird</p>
<p>impression of someone you know seeing someone on</p>
<p>television you know</p>
<p>television represents you to a certain extent</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like a lot of</p>
<p>these guys in the reality shows they get</p>
<p>upset like television</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t you know</p>
<p>it represents</p>
<p>you in little snippets and cuts you up you know</p>
<p>but the best way</p>
<p>to communicate with people for sure is the internet and</p>
<p>twitter and ustream</p>
<p>so combining the two of them together</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re doing is</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do this</p>
<p>every week the</p>
<p>thing behind me</p>
<p>while this bullshit behind me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all gonna get</p>
<p>cleared out and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna put up a</p>
<p>green screen so we</p>
<p>could have like</p>
<p>space behind us and shit</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna have this</p>
<p>thing set up</p>
<p>at a little bit more natural</p>
<p>angle so you like looking</p>
<p>right at us</p>
<p>which makes more</p>
<p>sense right yeah you put it anywhere you want</p>
<p>to put right there</p>
<p>is that better you say i put it</p>
<p>right in the middle yeah yeah</p>
<p>move this motherfucker</p>
<p>this is the</p>
<p>i upgraded my internet i had some old ass dsl</p>
<p>it was pretty wack</p>
<p>and i got rid of it</p>
<p>today actually</p>
<p>totally had got it set up is this work now</p>
<p>yeah much better so</p>
<p>the the dsl&rsquo;s gone and now i got cable and</p>
<p>cables fast as fuck so we&rsquo;re gonna be able to air</p>
<p>videos and shit while it&rsquo;s going on and</p>
<p>my mom designed my office purple shades bro what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong with purple it&rsquo;s a beautiful color</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t like that color</p>
<p>it should be fucking</p>
<p>black dude with</p>
<p>skulls like your fucking shirt bro</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>wrong with purple my friend it&rsquo;s a beautiful</p>
<p>color and there&rsquo;s brian see brian in the corner there</p>
<p>brian is actually right next to me</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s getting face fucked by that advertisement</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get face fucked you</p>
<p>should move yourself up</p>
<p>hi i&rsquo;m over here now can you move yourself up</p>
<p>right next to me</p>

<p>gonna get fucked by that uh</p>

<p>that&rsquo;s brian brian&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right next to me</p>
<p>anyway we&rsquo;re just talking</p>
<p>about the internet</p>
<p>being an awesome it&rsquo;s the fucking coolest</p>
<p>thing ever i mean to be able</p>
<p>to communicate with people directly like this to</p>
<p>be able to get the answers to any question at any time</p>
<p>to me it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>greatest fucking</p>
<p>thing in the world i</p>
<p>spend most of my day staring at a screen</p>
<p>reading stories</p>
<p>watching fucking youtube videos and</p>
<p>i swear i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>learned more</p>
<p>from the internet</p>
<p>more from just being on message</p>
<p>boards than i ever have</p>
<p>from you know</p>
<p>from other shit i&rsquo;ve got into</p>
<p>all sorts of different subjects because of message</p>
<p>boards you know and</p>
<p>wound up you know</p>
<p>being fans of</p>
<p>musicians and comedians and</p>
<p>people i would have never</p>
<p>heard of it wasn&rsquo;t for message boards</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>whole online</p>
<p>party i meet more people</p>
<p>online than i do in real life now fuck</p>
<p>yeah and i don&rsquo;t just live in my</p>
<p>house i go out a lot</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just more people interested in the same</p>
<p>things i like you</p>
<p>get to know them better on the internet</p>
<p>yeah well the internet</p>
<p>allows you when someone posts for a long time</p>
<p>especially a message</p>
<p>board community</p>
<p>you get to see how they interact with</p>
<p>other people you get to see what happens when you know</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re challenged on</p>
<p>their ideas you get to see what</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re made of you know it&rsquo;s really interesting yeah</p>
<p>you would the way people</p>
<p>write is different than the way they talk</p>
<p>because people can</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>slick and they</p>
<p>could try to bullshit you by really patiently</p>
<p>scribing out</p>
<p>their words but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>tricking you eventually eventually</p>
<p>that shit just comes out because they don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>how douchey they are they don&rsquo;t realize they</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re not douchey</p>
<p>but in your writing the douchey always comes out</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like this is your</p>
<p>expression is almost like a</p>
<p>printout of you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like you know like your dna or something like that</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>what i mean and plus google helps too because then you</p>
<p>catch a lot of people</p>
<p>oh yeah you know like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>catch people wait</p>
<p>what are you talking</p>
<p>about check out these</p>
<p>photos yeah and</p>
<p>people love to talk shit</p>
<p>people love to pretend that they know things</p>

<p>you know everybody</p>
<p>wants to be the wizard everybody wants to be the</p>
<p>smartest man in the world</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s real it&rsquo;s real interesting</p>
<p>but people love to talk shit</p>
<p>and for the longest time they just got away with it</p>

<p>that&rsquo;s awful news is it</p>
<p>awful news dude if you watch american idol</p>

<p>blatantly honest</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like yeah he is blatantly</p>
<p>mean about it isn&rsquo;t he</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not really mean he&rsquo;s just so honest that it&rsquo;s mean</p>

<p>think carl has</p>
<p>some sort of an anxiety disorder</p>
<p>but i know that he had to take him</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hard once you take him to get rid of him</p>
<p>i know a bunch of dudes that like need them</p>
<p>you know like people that have like</p>
<p>any sort of a back injury</p>
<p>debilitating back injury and that you get hooked on</p>
<p>those bitches and they get you through</p>
<p>the day i know a lot of people that just need that man</p>
<p>you know they need them</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just terrible and but what i was saying is</p>
<p>the the dudes that i know</p>
<p>that have had problems with pain pills a lot of them</p>
<p>like really</p>
<p>smart guys that went to college and they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>idiots you know why do you have that</p>
<p>thing in front of my face</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m moving it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just gonna show you this</p>
<p>video in a second</p>
<p>okay man but you can&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only been a second</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve seen this</p>
<p>i know i was gonna talk</p>
<p>about it okay but why do you have it in</p>
<p>front of my fucking face</p>
<p>i like looking at myself calm down</p>
<p>well nobody knows what the fuck you&rsquo;re doing yeah</p>
<p>who cares it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a fucking webcast dude this is serious business</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great thing</p>
<p>i totally forgot what i was even talking about</p>
<p>what was i talking about</p>
<p>actually i was doing this you</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>you stupid bullshit tell me</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen what the fuck was i just talking</p>
<p>about huh pretty crazy</p>
<p>about that dog though and i heard</p>
<p>that video huh</p>
<p>the dog in the</p>
<p>video that yeah</p>
<p>there was a dog that knew</p>
<p>about the earthquake before the people do</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s cause people hear shit they don&rsquo;t pay attention</p>
<p>the dog heard something&rsquo;s probably what the fuck</p>
<p>and the person</p>
<p>was like what the fuck is that shit he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>react and then it had</p>
<p>cause it was only like a</p>
<p>second before it there&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>video right here</p>
<p>watch the dog it just</p>
<p>freaked out and ran i mean but it was a</p>
<p>while before even anything shook</p>
<p>alright let&rsquo;s see it</p>
<p>again rewind it</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the dog</p>
<p>dogs chilling</p>
<p>dogs like what the fuck is that noise</p>
<p>okay we don&rsquo;t know that that dude didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>react this is a</p>
<p>stupid video no</p>
<p>no no but this is the problem the dog took off running</p>
<p>but the guy you don&rsquo;t see his face</p>
<p>the guy might have went oh shit what the fuck</p>
<p>and everybody is making it like the dog</p>
<p>heard this before anybody else i</p>
<p>think he felt something</p>
<p>because if you look at it but nothing&rsquo;s moving at all</p>
<p>right but sometimes you hear</p>
<p>things before the earthquake</p>
<p>well you know that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>you know it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>start moving</p>
<p>until let me see again</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re right you&rsquo;re right shit moving</p>
<p>maybe it made a sound yeah you&rsquo;re right nothing around</p>
<p>and if there was a sound right a real rumble right</p>
<p>still see something</p>
<p>monitor or something</p>
<p>so the dogs like two seconds more than a person</p>
<p>but guess what we got thumbs faggot</p>
<p>go chase you down tail and sleep in dirt</p>
<p>all right what else were we talking</p>
<p>about folks we were talking</p>
<p>about some important shit and i forgot</p>
<p>about god damn</p>
<p>we got a lot of twitter must just coming in this bitch</p>
<p>that mark mcguire</p>
<p>thing that thing is hilarious</p>
<p>mark maguire is finally coming out and saying</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about people that are hooked on pain pills</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>when dudes get hooked</p>
<p>on pain pills like i said i know a guy who&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>smart guy he was an it</p>
<p>guy went to you know</p>
<p>went to college</p>
<p>really avid reader</p>
<p>not a fuck up</p>
<p>has a real problem</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s just what it is man</p>
<p>dudes dudes get injured something happens to you and</p>
<p>it just it chemically</p>
<p>bonds with your body i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really incredible with it what addiction is</p>
<p>you know addiction is your body is somehow another</p>
<p>linked to something that&rsquo;s really terrible for it</p>
<p>and it needs that something like it becomes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like like heroin</p>
<p>and and crystal meth and</p>
<p>stuff like that that really locks a hold of your body</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like they&rsquo;re parasites it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>the the drug</p>
<p>itself has a consciousness and the drug itself is</p>
<p>gonna make you</p>
<p>do it as much as you can and rob you of life</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one way to look at like horrible substances</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why when people talk</p>
<p>about drugs</p>
<p>you know and they like to lump all drugs in together</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so stupid</p>
<p>because marijuana</p>
<p>and mushrooms and</p>
<p>psychedelic drugs if done correctly</p>
<p>can be very</p>
<p>beneficial and</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>over you don&rsquo;t feel any repercussions you&rsquo;re okay</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t hurt you</p>
<p>marijuana and</p>
<p>mushrooms and</p>
<p>things like that the natural</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>people have been doing for tens of thousands of years</p>
<p>those things aren&rsquo;t hurting anybody man</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t get into your system</p>
<p>and if you lump them in with</p>
<p>oxycodones and fucking heroin and crystal meth</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>no one is becoming a more</p>
<p>introspective fascinating person on crystal meth</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re becoming fucking</p>
<p>crazy it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>we have to like look at drugs</p>
<p>in terms of what they do to the people that take them</p>
<p>and the things that do positive</p>
<p>things you can&rsquo;t ignore that</p>
<p>just because they&rsquo;re a drug</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not allowed to just say</p>
<p>oh because it&rsquo;s an illegal drug</p>
<p>then all the benefits that people talk</p>
<p>about it those don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>count they&rsquo;re invalid</p>
<p>just because it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>sanctioned by a</p>
<p>group of fucking criminals</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ridiculous it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense at all</p>
<p>and you know i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>lived my whole life like this</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>2010 i would have thought by now</p>
<p>we would have come to some sort of a rational</p>
<p>understanding as</p>
<p>human beings</p>
<p>as we got to be</p>
<p>adults i thought we</p>
<p>would come to a</p>
<p>point where we</p>
<p>would sit back</p>
<p>and we would look at</p>
<p>things and go</p>
<p>what right do i</p>
<p>to tell another person</p>
<p>what to do or not to do</p>
<p>as long as he&rsquo;s not trying to give it to</p>
<p>minors or people that don&rsquo;t know any better</p>
<p>as long as people are educated let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>spend money on programs</p>
<p>and make sure that people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get involved in anything fucked up like this</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s pay attention to fucking children</p>
<p>schools i mean</p>
<p>the biggest problem this country isn&rsquo;t laws and</p>
<p>crime the biggest problem is why are people creating</p>
<p>crime why are people doing</p>
<p>these terrible</p>
<p>things to each</p>
<p>other and 99 99</p>
<p>of all fucked up</p>
<p>things become out of a fucked up childhood</p>
<p>you have kids who have</p>
<p>either shitty fucking parents and</p>
<p>in the these fucking</p>
<p>children they grow up and they&rsquo;re ticking time bombs</p>
<p>if you have a douchebag fucked up drug addict parent</p>
<p>and you live in a fucked up</p>
<p>place with no love</p>
<p>and every day you just see violence and shit and</p>
<p>screaming and</p>
<p>addiction and</p>
<p>sorrow and there&rsquo;s no way out you don&rsquo;t see shit</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t do well in</p>
<p>school i mean</p>
<p>what the fuck you know that is a ticking time bomb</p>
<p>and for politicians to not address that and to</p>
<p>spend all this</p>
<p>fucking time flying over to afghanistan trying to</p>
<p>chase down a hundred taliban</p>
<p>fighters in the mountains and</p>
<p>young people are</p>
<p>dying over there for that</p>
<p>how about we</p>
<p>spend that money attacking the fucking</p>
<p>enemy at home</p>
<p>the enemy at home is</p>
<p>horrible fucking childhoods</p>
<p>that some of our fellow</p>
<p>human beings</p>
<p>in this country</p>
<p>have to go through</p>
<p>you know what we really need to do is</p>
<p>focus on fucking kids</p>
<p>focus on children</p>
<p>that are growing up in terrible neighborhoods</p>
<p>focus on fucking</p>
<p>schools and community centers and giving these</p>
<p>kids somewhere to go to when</p>
<p>their parents suck</p>
<p>you know focus on a</p>
<p>bunch of people that want to help</p>
<p>raise kids that come from terrible situations or</p>
<p>help the parents</p>
<p>understand what</p>
<p>the fuck they&rsquo;re doing raising children and making</p>
<p>these kids fucking psychos and</p>
<p>giving them horrible</p>
<p>childhoods you know and</p>
<p>literally setting</p>
<p>loose a bomb</p>
<p>setting lose someone who&rsquo;s eventually</p>
<p>gonna turn all</p>
<p>their inward</p>
<p>anger outward another people all</p>
<p>their pain and resentment and all the negative</p>
<p>input coming into them as a child</p>
<p>you know that shit is fucking terrible</p>
<p>you deal with a</p>
<p>child that comes</p>
<p>from a positive loving environment and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna deal with a cool</p>
<p>human being</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s human beings</p>
<p>gonna come out of that and</p>
<p>gonna appreciate</p>
<p>other people</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s our number one problem</p>
<p>as human beings our number one problem as</p>
<p>human beings is the way we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>appreciate each other</p>
<p>the way we look at each</p>
<p>other is competition</p>
<p>the way we look at each</p>
<p>other is just</p>
<p>people that are on the highway in my fucking way</p>
<p>human beings have to</p>
<p>learn to appreciate each other</p>
<p>and we need to</p>
<p>learn how to</p>
<p>deal with the fucking very obvious shit that we ignore</p>
<p>instead of pretending there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>incredible assault on the</p>
<p>human race here in america</p>
<p>you know maybe we</p>
<p>should look on</p>
<p>where this is the real</p>
<p>crime coming from</p>
<p>where are the real murders coming from</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s the real</p>
<p>anger and violence</p>
<p>and the shit that affects day to day people</p>
<p>every day it&rsquo;s not in the fucking desert okay</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not in</p>
<p>the fucking mountains of afghanistan it&rsquo;s in cities</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all over the place</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s children growing up and</p>
<p>becoming fucking criminals that&rsquo;s way scarier to me</p>
<p>than some douchebag in afghanistan</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s nonsense</p>
<p>yeah someone</p>
<p>said carl and pills yeah that&rsquo;s something carl&rsquo;s</p>
<p>training partner said</p>
<p>but like i said i don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>all i know is that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s always been a cool dude to me carl</p>
<p>parisien is a</p>
<p>great fighter</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s got some unfortunate situations and i hope he</p>
<p>works him out i like that dude i like that dude a lot</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s good people</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>one of the best judo</p>
<p>guys to ever enter</p>
<p>mma you know he</p>
<p>he opened people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>eyes to a lot of shit that was possible</p>
<p>because before karl</p>
<p>nobody was hitting like</p>
<p>those beautiful fucking</p>
<p>throws he hits</p>
<p>these beautiful</p>
<p>shoulder throws and hip throws and</p>
<p>his his judo</p>
<p>like back when</p>
<p>he fought like dave strasser like when was</p>
<p>first ufc bounce</p>
<p>incredible judo</p>
<p>you know and it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>whenever you get a guy who steps into mma</p>
<p>and has some totally</p>
<p>something that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s really really good at that most people aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like like machida with karate</p>
<p>like people thought well karate is not that good karate</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really work</p>
<p>until machida came along</p>
<p>and machida</p>
<p>so good at karate</p>
<p>that he makes karate</p>
<p>work in mma</p>
<p>you know obviously he knows</p>
<p>wrestling and obviously he knows all the other</p>
<p>stuff that goes with mma</p>
<p>which is why he&rsquo;s such a champion</p>
<p>but the bottom line is his karate</p>
<p>his ability to move backward i mean he</p>
<p>fights like a fucking john claude van dam movie</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s pretty badass to watch</p>
<p>you know because</p>
<p>until the shogun fight</p>
<p>really didn&rsquo;t take</p>
<p>hardly any damage</p>
<p>what do i think</p>
<p>about the united arab emirates</p>
<p>buying to zhufa</p>
<p>well i know that the guy who is behind it all is</p>
<p>chic tak moon of</p>
<p>abu dhabi and that guy is a huge</p>
<p>fan of mixed martial arts and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>incredibly incredibly wealthy so</p>
<p>you know that guy can he can do a lot of good</p>
<p>things for mma</p>
<p>that guy he is a brazilian jiu jitsu black belt</p>
<p>under henzo gracie</p>
<p>and by all accounts he&rsquo;s legit</p>
<p>by all accounts he&rsquo;s a really good black belt</p>
<p>and henzo is</p>
<p>one of the most respected instructors in the world</p>
<p>if henzo gracie gives you a</p>
<p>black belt that&rsquo;s a huge honor</p>
<p>so that sheiktok</p>
<p>knew in the fact that he&rsquo;s a henzo gracie black belt</p>
<p>i know he&rsquo;s been having people</p>
<p>travel to abu dhabi for years for over a decade</p>
<p>since the late 90s</p>
<p>and he had some of the best instructors in the</p>
<p>world that would come and stay with him</p>
<p>and he had a</p>
<p>whole camp there and he&rsquo;d</p>
<p>bring guys and have guys to</p>
<p>train with i mean</p>
<p>dude is just the jujutsu</p>
<p>fiend just i mean like more than</p>
<p>way more than me you know</p>
<p>like i mean think</p>
<p>about how much i love jujutsu</p>
<p>and this guy is like</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just like he loves it and he has unlimited resources</p>
<p>so having a guy like that</p>
<p>as a business partner in the ufc i</p>
<p>think is gonna be</p>
<p>phenomenal for the</p>
<p>sport i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s any question</p>
<p>that guy is</p>
<p>gonna without a</p>
<p>doubt that guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna help out</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>interesting to go there that dude lives in a castle</p>
<p>like a fucking</p>
<p>some old school</p>
<p>out you know</p>
<p>alibaba type shit right yeah</p>
<p>is he the one with all the paintings</p>
<p>no who is the guy that know</p>
<p>the chic has like</p>
<p>i think that that</p>
<p>royal family is</p>
<p>worth like some insane amount of</p>
<p>money like they&rsquo;re one of the most</p>
<p>the richest people in the world</p>
<p>how about that if one of the richest people in the</p>
<p>world dude is a fucking</p>
<p>train killer</p>
<p>do i think talk to him</p>
<p>is gonna take an active role like dana</p>
<p>white i have no idea</p>
<p>all i do for the ufc is the commentary</p>
<p>you know i mean i talk to</p>
<p>those guys they&rsquo;re my friends but</p>
<p>obviously have no no</p>
<p>influence whatsoever on the business side of</p>
<p>things it&rsquo;s just my job to</p>
<p>call to action it&rsquo;s a really pretty fucking</p>
<p>crazy gig you know</p>
<p>you know for me it&rsquo;s like a perfect job because i&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>huge fan of</p>
<p>mixed martial arts like for real like i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t watch</p>
<p>like when i watch the different shows like k1 or</p>
<p>sen goku or</p>
<p>you know dream or or</p>
<p>strike force or anything like that</p>
<p>when i watch</p>
<p>those shows i don&rsquo;t watch those shows</p>
<p>for work i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t you know i don&rsquo;t get on the</p>
<p>underground and</p>
<p>mix martial arts com or</p>
<p>you know read all the bloody</p>
<p>elbow read all</p>
<p>these different websites and do it just for fun</p>
<p>i would have done it even if</p>
<p>i would have done it</p>
<p>even if it wasn&rsquo;t my job</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just a huge fan like</p>
<p>professionally</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m very lucky</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>crazy gig man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot of fun</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s cool too because</p>
<p>we get to go to the</p>
<p>fights and you know be there live and be</p>
<p>right in front of the</p>
<p>cage i mean it&rsquo;s just like there&rsquo;s nothing like that</p>
<p>what do you think of the last ufc</p>
<p>some good fights man</p>
<p>did you see it</p>
<p>that evan dunham dude how badass is that guy</p>
<p>and he got tagged in the first round</p>
<p>the first round</p>
<p>you know f frame was all over him</p>
<p>and then evan dunham</p>
<p>survived and pulled off that that fucking</p>
<p>armbar was so badass</p>
<p>the way he did it was like it was so wicked did he</p>
<p>break his arm at all</p>
<p>no he did not break his arm he fucked up his tendons</p>
<p>so lucky for him you know</p>
<p>it was a the problem is man if</p>
<p>the way that arm bar happened</p>
<p>see how his arm like he was bending it</p>
<p>completely at the joint</p>
<p>the scary kind is the way frank muir</p>
<p>broke tim sylvia&rsquo;s arm</p>
<p>because he actually</p>
<p>broke the middle of the forearm he</p>
<p>broke the forearm in half</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the scary shit that takes forever to heal</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s usually not the same</p>
<p>i like i don&rsquo;t think you know i think you</p>
<p>break your arm like that man like that&rsquo;s a serious</p>
<p>fucking fracture</p>
<p>like in the middle i think if you bust up a joint</p>
<p>they can put that together a little bit easier</p>
<p>you know fake arms and now by now you like</p>
<p>metal arms or bones or something</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think they can</p>
<p>i think they they do hips</p>
<p>and they do knees but once you get a knee</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a wrap</p>
<p>you ain&rsquo;t doing no jiu jitsu yeah</p>
<p>well this dude named connor connor hume</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>eddie&rsquo;s top students</p>
<p>a real high</p>
<p>level wrestler</p>
<p>and his dad was a</p>
<p>wrestler and his dad got a hip replacement</p>
<p>and his dad</p>
<p>still does jiu jitsu and</p>
<p>fights in tournaments and dudes like 50</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>you know but</p>
<p>he has a hip replacement but he&rsquo;s a fucking psycho</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a stud</p>
<p>you know the average</p>
<p>person you get a hip replacement and that&rsquo;s a rap</p>
<p>you know remember</p>
<p>that dude from the sopranos used to walk fucked up</p>
<p>the fat guy who turned out you know he&rsquo;s gay and the</p>
<p>sopranos and he had that weird walk</p>
<p>do you remember that guy</p>
<p>what was his name um</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>that guy&rsquo;s character how did he die i can&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>so they killed him</p>
<p>remember he was gay</p>
<p>right how how did</p>
<p>they murdered him i</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;d shoved like a fucking</p>
<p>a broomstick up his ass or a plunger</p>
<p>remember pq</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right a</p>
<p>pulq of his ass</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right because he was selling a line of pool cues</p>
<p>after that the dude</p>
<p>tried to sell a line of pool cues</p>
<p>a cue to die for</p>
<p>it was like the bottom</p>
<p>break it was like a</p>
<p>break stick</p>
<p>that was ridiculous but sopranos told him to</p>
<p>knock it off</p>
<p>how hilarious is that as a dude it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>marketing sense</p>
<p>i got killed a pool cue</p>
<p>all show down those</p>
<p>motherfuckers and they</p>
<p>sell pool cues</p>

<p>you know i can</p>
<p>see him doing some people are saying it&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just gone just he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>completely gone</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not hard to do</p>
<p>if you were</p>
<p>a person who wanted to be famous</p>
<p>and you know your</p>
<p>whole life you&rsquo;ve wanted to be famous and</p>
<p>you have this need this</p>
<p>hyper need for attention and then all of a</p>
<p>sudden it happens to you</p>
<p>like holy shit</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>lucky that the kind of fame that i got</p>
<p>like always was</p>
<p>especially the fear factor</p>
<p>fame was like</p>
<p>ridiculous fame</p>
<p>you know like no one&rsquo;s kissing your ass for fear factor</p>
<p>yeah you know people come up to you from fear factor</p>
<p>like what the fuck dude</p>
<p>and i was like yeah i know</p>
<p>what the fuck</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not like they love</p>
<p>you know if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like an actor or something like that and you&rsquo;re in some</p>
<p>crazy movies like that guy</p>
<p>is the kind of adulation that guy must get is insane</p>
<p>you know and if it was already</p>
<p>crazy to begin with</p>
<p>that just when when</p>
<p>crazy people</p>
<p>all of a sudden have money</p>

<p>like on the tv show or a movie</p>
<p>because once you become crazy</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re a star they let you be</p>
<p>crazy so you&rsquo;re just fucking hog wild and</p>
<p>doing blow and</p>
<p>punching people and</p>
<p>they try to</p>
<p>protect you as much as possible because you&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>goose that lays the golden egg</p>

<p>i&rsquo;ve heard a lot of people say that if you want to be</p>
<p>successful in business that you</p>
<p>literally have to</p>
<p>learn golf like you</p>
<p>literally have to</p>
<p>learn it if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>learn golf they hit refresh on the screen i</p>
<p>show you to see you can see what&rsquo;s there</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sad just</p>
<p>picture that picture you&rsquo;re talking about tire woods</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s wrong with this thing</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i mean you stream you&rsquo;re sucking it i would dummies i</p>
<p>would close your firefox and open up like in</p>
<p>safari or what chrome</p>
<p>maybe have too much shit open no</p>
<p>there goes i see</p>
<p>there goes the pictures up filing</p>
<p>see that&rsquo;s much the much of a delay</p>
<p>so like i said</p>
<p>if you see a werewolf behind me and you hear that</p>
<p>believe me i&rsquo;m already dead okay</p>
<p>just be kind to me on the message boards</p>
<p>people are brutal</p>
<p>about artie</p>
<p>lang man that was really sad to see</p>
<p>how many people were brutal</p>
<p>after artie</p>
<p>lang try to commit suicide</p>
<p>by calling them</p>
<p>people just like that suicide shit</p>
<p>right i know but it wasn&rsquo;t just that</p>
<p>it was it was</p>
<p>they were they were insulting him like it didn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>you know you know like that he&rsquo;s weak and he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>piece of shit</p>
<p>like i said</p>
<p>about where i talked</p>
<p>about the people that i know that have</p>
<p>had problems with pain pills</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>you know the guy likes to jerk</p>
<p>off he jerks off too much like that guy you need to</p>
<p>smack him in the head what the fuck is</p>
<p>wrong with you</p>
<p>you lost your job because you jerk off five times a day</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s dudes like that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like they miss jobs they show up late for work</p>
<p>just cause they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like chronic master bears they wake up in the morning</p>
<p>they have to beat off they don&rsquo;t beat off they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go crazy</p>
<p>like they get</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a dude that&rsquo;s got a problem that guys</p>
<p>he needs a smack in the head</p>
<p>people that are like compulsive</p>
<p>gamblers that&rsquo;s a compulsion and that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a problem</p>
<p>and your pattern of thinking</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a problem in the way</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve been compulsive</p>
<p>about many things in my life i</p>
<p>understand i</p>
<p>understand the</p>
<p>thinking behind it</p>
<p>but that can all be corrected</p>
<p>you just need to</p>
<p>learn how to</p>
<p>think correctly</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a big difference between that and like heroin</p>
<p>and oxycontin</p>
<p>and math and</p>
<p>people to get addicted to shit that shit&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>you know so to to get</p>
<p>to shit all</p>
<p>over someone because they&rsquo;re addicted to a drug</p>
<p>man it ain&rsquo;t</p>
<p>easy to kick that you don&rsquo;t you know</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re deep in the</p>
<p>throws of heroin</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t talk shit</p>
<p>and if you have been and i haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>so i can say nothing but i&rsquo;ve talked to people who have</p>
<p>i i had a friend who died from heroin</p>
<p>i i knew a couple people that died from heroin</p>
<p>and the one that i knew</p>
<p>he was he was a real real</p>
<p>smart guy he was he was a cool dude</p>
<p>he just couldn&rsquo;t stop it</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t you know i don&rsquo;t i</p>
<p>think some people bond to those</p>
<p>dangerous drugs and you&rsquo;re fucked</p>
<p>so whatever happened with him</p>
<p>already laying was</p>
<p>every time i met that guy&rsquo;s always been cool to me</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s how i</p>
<p>judge people he&rsquo;s always fun to be around friendly</p>
<p>jovial he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i think he&rsquo;s hilarious</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just he&rsquo;s a nice guy</p>
<p>you know and to me it just made me sad</p>
<p>and maybe just a sad that people were</p>
<p>willing to shit on this guy because he</p>
<p>tried to kill himself</p>
<p>but you are</p>
<p>right people get mad when people try to kill themselves</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>especially when</p>
<p>people have a much better life than them</p>
<p>you know i mean that was the argument that i</p>
<p>heard over and over</p>
<p>again about arty</p>
<p>like this fucking guy you</p>
<p>know what are his</p>
<p>problems he&rsquo;s got a mercedes and you know he&rsquo;s rich and</p>
<p>all true but that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make you feel better unfortunately</p>
<p>you think it</p>
<p>would but it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>if your life sucks</p>
<p>your life sucks and</p>
<p>it really has nothing to do with you being rich or poor</p>
<p>rich can definitely help</p>
<p>things because you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>worry about your bills and you</p>
<p>have less problems you have a little bit less stress</p>
<p>but then you got problems with your</p>
<p>money and investments and people</p>
<p>stealing from you and bullshit you know</p>
<p>yeah you have problems all over the place</p>
<p>definitely better to have it than not but</p>
<p>the bottom line is just because you&rsquo;re successful</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>happy there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of people that are fucking hardly hard</p>
<p>hardly depressed and they</p>
<p>they sit around</p>
<p>thinking what the fuck is the purpose of this life</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>the real problem is that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good goddamn question what is the purpose of this life</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not here for</p>
<p>other people</p>
<p>what are you here for</p>
<p>because realistically</p>
<p>you get to a certain</p>
<p>point in your life like artie and i are</p>
<p>basically the same age</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m 42 and i believe he is too</p>
<p>and you know you get to a</p>
<p>point where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like you get all this gray like i have gray hair</p>
<p>on my beard and on my balls i have like 20 gray hairs</p>
<p>gray hair is coming in here</p>
<p>i mean this is like you know</p>
<p>your body&rsquo;s dying</p>
<p>so at a certain</p>
<p>point in time you</p>
<p>gotta go what</p>
<p>the fuck is the purpose of all this what am i here for</p>
<p>you know and if you don&rsquo;t have like a relationship</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have someone you love</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>really good friends that you love and you love to be</p>
<p>around you don&rsquo;t have a family you don&rsquo;t have children</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have someone that you</p>
<p>mean something to and someone that you feed off of each</p>
<p>other and you</p>
<p>share energy and</p>
<p>you make them feel good and they make you feel good and</p>
<p>they miss you and you miss them</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s very very very very important for people</p>
<p>and people just</p>
<p>underestimate how huge that is</p>
<p>you know having friends and having family</p>
<p>and having like good quality people in your life and</p>
<p>not douchebags cut the douchebags out</p>
<p>that is so important because</p>
<p>nothing can fuck your life up more than people who</p>
<p>are not looking out for your best interest</p>
<p>and want you to fail because they&rsquo;re fucked up you know</p>
<p>try to let them</p>
<p>aware of it let them be</p>
<p>aware of it</p>
<p>give them an opportunity to change and if they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get rid of them cut them out of your life</p>
<p>so important</p>
<p>just separate yourself from anybody negative that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna fuck with you</p>
<p>that can make</p>
<p>such a huge difference in the quality of your life</p>
<p>you know and then of course</p>
<p>get the fuck away from drugs the bad ones</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t fuck around with heroin</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t fuck around</p>
<p>with math don&rsquo;t fuck around with anything dangerous</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna do something</p>
<p>do do things that people have</p>
<p>never died from</p>
<p>and make sure</p>
<p>you know what the fuck you&rsquo;re doing before you do it</p>
<p>you know don&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>crazy and smoke the</p>
<p>whole joint the first time</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;ll shit your</p>
<p>pants in paranoia</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll freak the fuck out</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll probably</p>
<p>never gonna get high again</p>
<p>the first time you ever get high you</p>
<p>should just get a little</p>
<p>tiny bit high just a little take a tiny bit of a hit</p>
<p>and get used to it you know okay</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like riding a surfboard</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just hop on you&rsquo;ll be awesome at it</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>feeling of being caught up in the wave of thc when</p>
<p>when when you get</p>
<p>really high it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re connecting to like</p>
<p>another frequency that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not available to you when you&rsquo;re sober</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what people who don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>smoke marijuana don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>awareness an</p>
<p>opening of your mind i mean i&rsquo;ve had explained to me</p>
<p>chemically about</p>
<p>gaba and dopamine and all the different</p>
<p>things that go on there was a recent threat</p>
<p>about it on my message</p>
<p>board where people are talking about the</p>
<p>effect of it</p>
<p>but the bottom line is it does something to the way you</p>
<p>think and it opens up new</p>
<p>levels of awareness</p>
<p>and if you get too much of that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>freak the fuck out and that&rsquo;s called being paranoid</p>
<p>but what paranoia</p>
<p>comes from is this is probably the first time</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re recognizing reality</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a very vulnerable person we all are life is is</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s a transient</p>
<p>experience it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna pass from this to something else</p>
<p>maybe who knows</p>
<p>who knows what the fuck this is in the</p>
<p>first place</p>
<p>who knows what the</p>
<p>ultimate goal of the</p>
<p>human race is</p>
<p>in the first place</p>
<p>you you just live your life and go through it and</p>
<p>you put your</p>
<p>blinders on</p>
<p>and when you have a hit of some really good weed</p>
<p>those blinders just fall down around you</p>
<p>and you realize like wow</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m this fragile</p>
<p>fleshy little temporary being</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s clinging to this</p>
<p>spinning orb</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s flying through the galaxy</p>
<p>and people are sitting around talking</p>
<p>about john and</p>
<p>cade and and</p>
<p>and fucking</p>
<p>miley cyrus and nonsense</p>
<p>and while this is all</p>
<p>going on we&rsquo;re hurling through the galaxy</p>
<p>and it literally is</p>
<p>never discussed you know and i have a bit</p>
<p>about it you can see it on youtube i think</p>
<p>somebody put it up</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s from my</p>
<p>shiny happy</p>
<p>jihad cd it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about flying through</p>
<p>space but that&rsquo;s what we are i mean</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just animals clinging to</p>
<p>a sphere in eternity</p>
<p>in this gigantic sea</p>
<p>of eternity</p>
<p>sea of space this</p>
<p>never ending</p>
<p>thing that we&rsquo;re a part of but we</p>
<p>completely ignore</p>
<p>and we focus in the most</p>
<p>mundane bullshit</p>
<p>like tiger woods fucking all</p>
<p>these girls</p>
<p>you know and like what else what are the</p>
<p>other dumb shit that people been</p>
<p>focusing on lately in the news</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know but i</p>
<p>think why people</p>
<p>focus on so much of it is because</p>
<p>you know they need something</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like kind of</p>
<p>watching the same</p>
<p>movie over and over</p>
<p>again you know you need constant new information and</p>
<p>stuff like that you know</p>
<p>like i understand what you&rsquo;re saying like</p>
<p>about the whole</p>
<p>thing but i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s why so many people</p>
<p>focus on the dumb shit because the the</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s new shit you know that same</p>
<p>thing you think that yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good point</p>
<p>so like what you&rsquo;re saying is that</p>
<p>the reason why people</p>
<p>focus on like</p>
<p>tiger woods and</p>
<p>stuff like that is just because it&rsquo;s new information it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been in</p>
<p>space for so long and nothing happens</p>
<p>and you look</p>
<p>up you see stars blah blah blah shut the fuck up</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s like if having the same cell phone</p>
<p>would you have the same cell</p>
<p>phone for 10 years or</p>
<p>if tiger wood</p>
<p>cell phone came out</p>
<p>would you get the</p>
<p>tiger wood cell</p>
<p>phone that&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>point i think</p>
<p>brian&rsquo;s on to something</p>
<p>i think i mean it makes</p>
<p>sense because</p>
<p>you know people are we do really we have this</p>
<p>push for new</p>
<p>things and innovation and it&rsquo;s literally</p>
<p>built into our hard wiring</p>
<p>right which is why you can take a guy with the hottest</p>
<p>chick in the</p>
<p>world and he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t want to fuck her anymore</p>
<p>like you get</p>
<p>tired of fucking the hottest</p>
<p>chick in the</p>
<p>world and that really is true</p>
<p>you know that can happen yeah if you look at life the</p>
<p>wrong way and that&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>other things that&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>about weed if you</p>
<p>smoke weed and you fuck your</p>
<p>girlfriend like</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t usually do that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re fucking a new person</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you</p>
<p>appreciate her all for like who she is and what she</p>
<p>what she looks like you</p>
<p>appreciate it all over</p>
<p>again it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>weird man at</p>
<p>least for me</p>
<p>do you feel like that when you</p>
<p>smoke weed and</p>
<p>get with your lady yeah</p>
<p>when you smoke weed get with your lady</p>
<p>my lady doesn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>smoke weed so it&rsquo;s not really that fun well mine can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>right now because she&rsquo;s pregnant with me bambino</p>
<p>so have you played with the nexus one yet</p>
<p>no i have not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not a fan huh</p>
<p>nah not really</p>
<p>brian michael tech review ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>the main problem is if you have something</p>
<p>like we both have iphones and you have facebook</p>
<p>and twitter and all</p>
<p>these applications</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve had droid why have an inferior version</p>
<p>yeah all of them in</p>
<p>the facebook on the</p>
<p>droid sucks the twitter on the droids not as good as</p>
<p>twitter to you know</p>
<p>everything is just</p>
<p>yeah i have the</p>
<p>blackberry and i have uber twitter on it</p>
<p>you know i use</p>
<p>i have an iphone but i really use it more of as like a</p>
<p>like a laptop that i keep in my pocket</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really what it is for me because</p>
<p>the bottom line with the iphone is it&rsquo;s on at amp</p>
<p>t and at amp</p>
<p>t sucks when</p>
<p>when i&rsquo;m talking to people on at</p>
<p>t i can guarantee is</p>
<p>going to cut out</p>
<p>three or four times before i get wherever the fuck i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going when i</p>
<p>driving my car</p>
<p>i love the fact that i can have both hands on a</p>
<p>steering wheel</p>
<p>and i can just talk</p>
<p>you know and i&rsquo;m having conversations and i can</p>
<p>you know do business and answer questions and</p>
<p>catch up with old friends that i don&rsquo;t have a chance to</p>
<p>catch up with</p>
<p>i love that man that seems</p>
<p>huge to me to me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the most important features of</p>
<p>communication the ability to fucking talk to somebody</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t like text messaging just back and forth</p>
<p>after a while man you like</p>
<p>i wanna hear your fucking</p>
<p>voice you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the way</p>
<p>i like talking to people you know it&rsquo;s fun</p>
<p>you know you can get</p>
<p>things out you feed off of each other</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>volley you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going back and forth</p>
<p>so if your fucking</p>
<p>phone can&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>phone calls</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s weak</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s weak shit so</p>
<p>i use a blackberry with verizon</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s paying me to say this</p>
<p>but the reason why use a blackberry</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because we do</p>
<p>ufcs in the uk</p>
<p>and the only way you can get</p>
<p>a phone that works overseas you got to get a</p>
<p>world phone</p>
<p>because we have two different</p>
<p>systems here in america we have cdma</p>
<p>and gsm and gsm is</p>
<p>t mobile and at amp t</p>
<p>and cdma is</p>
<p>sprint and verizon</p>
<p>and there are two totally different types of signals</p>
<p>well in other</p>
<p>countries most</p>
<p>other countries don&rsquo;t use the cdma</p>
<p>which verizon has</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the best in america</p>
<p>in america it&rsquo;s the shit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s way better i mean</p>
<p>when i drive to</p>
<p>jiu jitsu i</p>
<p>would lose people</p>
<p>three times with my at amp t phone</p>
<p>three fucking times</p>
<p>would drive me crazy</p>
<p>but my verizon</p>
<p>right there</p>
<p>it never drops off for a</p>
<p>second it&rsquo;s so much better</p>
<p>but the bottom line is this shit is wack</p>
<p>this phone is like</p>
<p>an iphone from</p>
<p>20 fucking years ago that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like some cheap</p>
<p>knock off you know like some</p>
<p>third world country</p>
<p>you know where they make fake</p>
<p>watches and shit like that they try to</p>
<p>knock off cameras are pretty nice the</p>
<p>flashes are pretty nice yes</p>
<p>yes the cameras dope</p>
<p>the flash is very good</p>
<p>the video is excellent yes</p>
<p>threaded texting</p>
<p>the video is excellent</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not bad to type on</p>
<p>the typing this is the new one the</p>
<p>storm 2 the double</p>
<p>clicking is not bad</p>
<p>that one is</p>
<p>dropping the toilet</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s dropping the toilet</p>
<p>this was right next to my poo</p>
<p>let his job</p>
<p>yes totally</p>
<p>i was at the 9 30 club in washington dc</p>
<p>by the way i</p>
<p>had a good fucking time down there dc people</p>
<p>thank you very much for your hospitality</p>
<p>awesome awesome show i had a great time</p>
<p>but anyway i was at the</p>
<p>9 30 club this friday night</p>
<p>and i was pooing</p>
<p>my my pre performance poo poo</p>
<p>and i got up and this</p>
<p>phone cause i was called a</p>
<p>piece of shit commit</p>
<p>committed suicide and dove</p>
<p>from my pocket</p>
<p>into the shitty toilet it&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;ll show you who a</p>
<p>piece of shit is</p>
<p>trying to kill data i know what it&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>because it knows that i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t backed up in a couple of weeks</p>
<p>i was trying to</p>
<p>i got some cool</p>
<p>pictures and</p>
<p>videos on here</p>
<p>and this motherfucker is trying to kill himself</p>
<p>and so i got it out and</p>
<p>shook it and</p>
<p>shook all the</p>
<p>water out but</p>
<p>i dried it with a hair dryer and the</p>
<p>bitch came back i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>it works probably</p>
<p>tired of listening to your shit joe rogan</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s terrible for anything else</p>
<p>when you try to go on the internet you want to</p>
<p>shoot yourself</p>
<p>you try to use</p>
<p>the twitter function on here it&rsquo;s so clunky</p>
<p>and wack and typing is</p>
<p>much it&rsquo;s okay to type like text</p>
<p>but when you have to type in numbers</p>
<p>you have to like really concentrate</p>
<p>this little tiny ass keyboard</p>
<p>where the numbers are and you&rsquo;re always fucking up</p>
<p>like when i have to give someone if i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>answering an</p>
<p>email and i have to give someone a dress or a</p>
<p>phone number</p>
<p>it takes five fucking minutes because i</p>
<p>barely can push down the</p>
<p>three i&rsquo;m also i&rsquo;m always getting the number</p>
<p>right next to it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really weak and annoying</p>
<p>so the iphone is shit it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>so goddamn far above</p>
<p>every other</p>
<p>phone out there it&rsquo;s not even</p>
<p>close if you&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>about you want one</p>
<p>phone if you only had to choose between one phone</p>
<p>you gotta go</p>
<p>with the iphone but if you can afford to have two</p>
<p>phones the iphone is</p>
<p>great for like a little computer</p>
<p>to me it&rsquo;s huge</p>
<p>for pictures and twitters and applications and</p>
<p>going i would probably wait</p>
<p>until after the</p>
<p>apple announcement in two weeks though</p>
<p>just in case if there&rsquo;s a verizon iphone if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a verizon iphone i&rsquo;ll fucking jump for joy but i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be one we</p>
<p>think that the verizon</p>
<p>thing what we&rsquo;ve read online because we&rsquo;re both</p>
<p>brian and i have</p>
<p>all tech retards</p>
<p>the late verizon</p>
<p>thing is probably</p>
<p>going to be some sort of a</p>
<p>tablet like a little</p>
<p>like an internet like a kindle</p>
<p>but you can get on the internet with it</p>
<p>which would be kind of interesting</p>
<p>like a netbook</p>
<p>with no keyboard</p>
<p>or just an oversized iphone pretty much have you</p>
<p>heard of aubrey de grey yeah he&rsquo;s that guy he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a guy from england that is</p>
<p>a professor and a scientist who&rsquo;s working hard on</p>
<p>life extension</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s an interesting dude kind of a</p>
<p>kind of a real eccentric</p>
<p>character with</p>
<p>crazy long beard and</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got all these</p>
<p>really complex theories on how to extend the</p>
<p>human lifetime like a thousand years</p>
<p>like the only way you would die is if you had you know</p>
<p>like got an accident or something or sickness</p>
<p>pretty fascinating shit</p>
<p>the problem is if people</p>
<p>live forever there&rsquo;s not enough room for everybody</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;re trying to fuck with nature</p>
<p>you know nature has us in a cycle</p>
<p>and the cycle</p>
<p>is very simple</p>
<p>nobody lives more than like</p>
<p>120 years if you&rsquo;re the baddest</p>
<p>motherfucker ever</p>
<p>you live to be a buck 20</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re done</p>
<p>and the last few years you are a fragile mess</p>
<p>and you better not go anywhere</p>
<p>you know you could tie your</p>
<p>shoes and break your back in half</p>
<p>you know you could</p>
<p>fall down you know when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to wipe your ass and head</p>
<p>plant into the wall and be done</p>
<p>crack your neck paralyzed</p>
<p>shit all over the</p>
<p>floor i mean that</p>
<p>could be the end it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be ugly you know you&rsquo;re gonna be a human</p>
<p>roll a tissue paper that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re gonna be so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the cycle of life</p>
<p>and you have children and those children</p>
<p>you pass on</p>
<p>your information and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s supposed to happen</p>
<p>we are in the active process of evolving</p>
<p>as a species</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s two</p>
<p>things that are</p>
<p>gonna aid that involvement or</p>
<p>evolvement rather</p>
<p>that evolution it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be either</p>
<p>technology or it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be what we</p>
<p>learn and what we pass on</p>
<p>and if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>evolve and if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t pass on something if your children don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>evolve like this race</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>from just the people that are</p>
<p>alive now living forever okay</p>
<p>because people don&rsquo;t change that much</p>
<p>they try they do</p>
<p>their best but the amount of people</p>
<p>that change over the amount of people that don&rsquo;t change</p>
<p>i mean shit</p>
<p>how many people do you know that get</p>
<p>their shit together</p>
<p>that have gotten</p>
<p>their shit together they didn&rsquo;t have it</p>
<p>you know how many people do you know</p>
<p>mmm not many not that many</p>
<p>most people who are a fucking mess stay a mess</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not good</p>
<p>those aren&rsquo;t good odds for a</p>
<p>whole race of</p>
<p>humans you know i</p>
<p>think that the best</p>
<p>bet for the</p>
<p>human race and we really care</p>
<p>about it as a whole</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>we care about</p>
<p>ourselves because we&rsquo;re animals and because we have</p>
<p>these instincts and</p>
<p>these instincts are designed to make sure that we stay</p>
<p>alive and that&rsquo;s just hard wiring even though</p>
<p>your logic and your reason</p>
<p>would dictate well</p>
<p>hey i&rsquo;m only here for a temporary amount of time anyway</p>
<p>i need to look at this like</p>
<p>what is my purpose here what am i supposed to be doing</p>
<p>and what you&rsquo;re supposed</p>
<p>to be doing is making it better for the next people</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re supposed to be doing</p>
<p>is making it as good as you can for the people here</p>
<p>and leaving an</p>
<p>impression so that</p>
<p>maybe you can enhance the minds and</p>
<p>open the eyes and set the tone</p>
<p>for the next people</p>
<p>you know if you meet a guy who&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i mean every time i&rsquo;ve ever met someone who&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>really fucking cool and really nice and really friendly</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always inspired me</p>
<p>to be cooler and nicer and friendlier it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>cool to meet people like that</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>when i was growing up in boston</p>
<p>i knew a lot of fucking</p>
<p>hard ass people i knew a lot of people that were just</p>
<p>always ready to insult you and always wanted to</p>
<p>fight and i know a lot of</p>
<p>and if you grow up around a lot of people like that</p>
<p>you become like that</p>
<p>it can make you like that you live in that environment</p>
<p>where everybody&rsquo;s kind of douchey to each</p>
<p>other on occasion</p>
<p>you know like you go out to a bar in boston</p>
<p>your chances are you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna see a fight</p>
<p>you go to a</p>
<p>nightclub in boston do</p>
<p>still throw down</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s one of the few</p>
<p>places like</p>
<p>remember when we went to at</p>
<p>least do the</p>
<p>comedy connection in fanno hall</p>
<p>and after the show like two o&rsquo;clock in the morning</p>
<p>that fucking</p>
<p>place would be alive</p>
<p>in the summertime</p>
<p>it was crackling it was crackling</p>
<p>like at any moment</p>
<p>you could see</p>
<p>a fucking brawl</p>
<p>break out where dudes</p>
<p>punch somebody and fucking</p>
<p>tables would</p>
<p>start flying</p>
<p>i mean it was a crazy</p>
<p>place yeah i</p>
<p>would hate to live there</p>
<p>yeah how many</p>
<p>fights we see there we saw so many</p>
<p>fights and so many</p>
<p>close fights</p>
<p>me and rem has gotten a</p>
<p>fight at mcdonald&rsquo;s yeah</p>
<p>just waiting in line for</p>
<p>dudes are way more</p>
<p>aggressive in boston</p>
<p>than like say if you go out</p>
<p>and try to get something to eat in texas</p>
<p>you know people are</p>
<p>generally pretty fucking friendly</p>
<p>like everybody has this like</p>
<p>this stereotype of texas</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re way safer</p>
<p>going out to get some late</p>
<p>night food in texas like</p>
<p>especially like austin</p>
<p>shit austin&rsquo;s badass</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the friendliest</p>
<p>fucking cities in the country</p>
<p>you know you want to go get something to</p>
<p>eat at 2 o&rsquo;clock in the morning in austin you&rsquo;re fine</p>
<p>you go get something</p>
<p>to eat at 2 o&rsquo;clock in the morning in boston</p>
<p>you might see a fucking assault</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>might be a part of something you</p>
<p>gotta watch</p>
<p>where the fuck you&rsquo;re going yeah</p>
<p>okay ladies and gentlemen we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go to the questions</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>to be something you&rsquo;re not looking forward to</p>
<p>about fatherhood</p>
<p>well i&rsquo;m already a father i love it</p>
<p>what you don&rsquo;t look forward</p>
<p>to is you don&rsquo;t look forward to the fact that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to lose a lot of your time</p>
<p>without a doubt you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to</p>
<p>spend if you don&rsquo;t want to be a shitty parent</p>
<p>you know if you&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>a childhood that was less than perfect</p>
<p>which i think most of us have right</p>
<p>you learn from that and you&rsquo;re supposed</p>
<p>to be a better person and a better parent from that</p>
<p>and once you have a fucking kid man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like alright you have this</p>
<p>immense immense</p>
<p>responsibility</p>
<p>to raise a human being correctly</p>
<p>and you gotta get your own shit together you know</p>
<p>it forces you</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>definitely have to look at</p>
<p>things a little bit differently because you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna have the same amount of free time</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t look at yourself like you&rsquo;re the only</p>
<p>thing you know that&rsquo;s what i was talking</p>
<p>about before</p>
<p>with like a lot of people that i know that aren&rsquo;t happy</p>
<p>one of the reasons why they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>happy is they don&rsquo;t have people in</p>
<p>their life you know like that are really important</p>
<p>you know like i know dudes that are like</p>
<p>grown men that don&rsquo;t even have like really really</p>
<p>close friends</p>
<p>they have like friends</p>
<p>but they like</p>
<p>keep shit from them and you know</p>
<p>sometimes they get in bad arguments with them and they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have anybody that they really open up and are 100</p>
<p>honest with</p>
<p>which is really huge</p>
<p>you know if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have like a real friend that you can fucking tell</p>
<p>everything to</p>
<p>you gotta have</p>
<p>those in your life man</p>
<p>those are huge</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re all out</p>
<p>like when it&rsquo;s me and brian and</p>
<p>eddie and joey and we&rsquo;re all out bullshitting</p>
<p>we tell each</p>
<p>other basically everything</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one of the fun</p>
<p>things about it</p>
<p>you know one of the fun</p>
<p>things about</p>
<p>hanging out with like people that you really like is</p>
<p>you know you get to see inside each</p>
<p>other&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>the wiring under the board</p>
<p>you get to see how your</p>
<p>brain works you know you get to</p>
<p>throw out the way you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking and what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on your life to them and see how</p>
<p>you know a person who&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>living your life</p>
<p>but loves you and looks out for you and wants you to be</p>
<p>happy gets to look at it and see it</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s very important for people</p>
<p>because sometimes you can&rsquo;t see your life objectively</p>
<p>sometimes you</p>
<p>need somebody in your life that that cares about you</p>
<p>and when people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have that shit they don&rsquo;t feel like they have that 100</p>
<p>honesty with someone</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re disconnected to the universe</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>of the reasons why people get so depressed</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re depressed because you don&rsquo;t have all</p>
<p>this love in your life you have to have a lot of love</p>
<p>and you have to put it out there too</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re putting out shit you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get shit back</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get into a downward</p>
<p>spiral that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>never gonna put out pull out of</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have a shitty life</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re putting</p>
<p>out bad energy it&rsquo;s always coming back at you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>gonna be unlucky you&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>gonna be unhappy it&rsquo;s just the way it is</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re an asshole</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna be</p>
<p>happy assholes they look like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>happy cause you see them laughing</p>
<p>they go home and cry and</p>
<p>drink or they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fucking psycho and they have no emotions whatsoever</p>
<p>me but no one is</p>
<p>happy being negative everybody wants to be loving</p>
<p>everybody wants to have</p>
<p>good friends and have a good fucking time so</p>
<p>this aubrey de grey guy you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna live forever</p>
<p>bitch and you&rsquo;re not supposed to</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supposed to</p>
<p>do what you can</p>
<p>to the people that you</p>
<p>influence and</p>
<p>touch in this life</p>
<p>and hope that it carries on to the next</p>
<p>and we all know this</p>
<p>we all know this inherently and</p>
<p>we all know inherently the people have done this to us</p>
<p>like i said we&rsquo;ve all met people that inspired us</p>
<p>and i think that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re here for i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re supposed to do it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>are you playing shit</p>
<p>while i&rsquo;m doing this</p>
<p>while i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>what is this robot</p>
<p>why are you playing distracting shit</p>
<p>let me know</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re playing shit tell me what it is okay</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to read the questions off here man</p>
<p>any plans for a book yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m writing a book man but</p>
<p>the problem is i&rsquo;m writing comedy at the same time and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m also writing</p>
<p>blog entries and i&rsquo;m also trying to do all my</p>
<p>other bullshit so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s taking some time you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to sit down just</p>
<p>write a book</p>
<p>because i sit down and</p>
<p>write things and i just want to</p>
<p>write about one</p>
<p>thing that day and then</p>
<p>i like that&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>things i like</p>
<p>about blogs</p>
<p>i could just</p>
<p>write it and</p>
<p>throw it up and bam there it is</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m always looking for new ways that people</p>
<p>could listen to</p>
<p>my shit get my ideas out there and get my</p>
<p>stuff out there and</p>
<p>come to see me doing</p>
<p>stand up and you know the different ways to do that</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>book books are</p>
<p>legitimate ways they&rsquo;re ways there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still a lot</p>
<p>of people that don&rsquo;t even have any idea that i&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>stand up comedian you know just because i like</p>
<p>stuff that i&rsquo;ve done that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>funny like fear factor</p>
<p>and whatever and you know and then doing</p>
<p>commentary for the</p>
<p>ufc is the same</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people that</p>
<p>really have no idea</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;m even a comedian</p>
<p>so i try to like do the best i can to</p>
<p>use all the</p>
<p>different avenues to get that out there so i</p>
<p>think a book is</p>
<p>gonna help and also i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;d be cool to have something that i actually</p>
<p>wrote that&rsquo;s a book</p>
<p>you know i just think</p>
<p>having a real book</p>
<p>in the bookstores something cool about that</p>
<p>book takes lots of concentration smoke more weed</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an excellent advice i almost always write stoned</p>
<p>you know and it might not make sense</p>
<p>and the problem is i like read it when i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>stoned i&rsquo;m like what the fuck was i rambling about</p>
<p>when i&rsquo;m high it&rsquo;s all like</p>
<p>super genius shit</p>
<p>yeah i was talking about depression</p>
<p>brian&rsquo;s playing a fucking robot video</p>
<p>trying to lighten the mood joe</p>

<p>actually do it</p>
<p>right now we do it live</p>
<p>well you know that&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>things i like</p>
<p>about like a</p>
<p>regular goddamn comedy club a regular comedy club</p>
<p>was the ticket</p>
<p>cost 25 bucks</p>
<p>you walk in the door you pay your 25</p>
<p>bucks and that&rsquo;s it man yeah</p>
<p>you know or if you show up</p>
<p>early you know you go to the box office</p>
<p>or you can order online</p>
<p>you just buy it from the club and that&rsquo;s what it costs</p>
<p>right you go through an agency but if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do like a big concert or something like that</p>
<p>you have to go through an agency that&rsquo;s another world</p>
<p>you know once you</p>
<p>start doing like big</p>
<p>venues start doing like several thousand people</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a totally different</p>
<p>world that&rsquo;s why i love comedy clubs</p>
<p>first of all the show&rsquo;s better</p>
<p>the shows are</p>
<p>always better when it&rsquo;s like less than 600 people</p>
<p>you know once you get over like six hundred people</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re still fun there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still a lot of fun</p>
<p>you know dc was more than six hundred people i</p>
<p>think but they&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still a good time don&rsquo;t get me wrong but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just not the same experience</p>
<p>the same the</p>
<p>experience you get in the comedy club it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right there you&rsquo;re in the mix there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>low ceilings and shit and it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>300 of you and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fucking around just hanging out you know okay</p>
<p>three tickets</p>
<p>try to guess the</p>
<p>grand total</p>
<p>tell me 159</p>
<p>60 cents for</p>
<p>three tickets that&rsquo;s a lot of money man</p>
<p>have i smoked weed with doug benson probably</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t remember though</p>
<p>i must have</p>
<p>i might not have though</p>
<p>i think i did once i</p>
<p>think i showed him the solo pipe</p>

<p>doug&rsquo;s a very nice guy</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s a real cool guy</p>
<p>very nice guy and i did his podcast he&rsquo;s very fun too</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got a i love</p>
<p>movies podcast but i was totally useless on it because</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not a big movie fan</p>
<p>so they were talking like they were all</p>
<p>going on especially patent patton i</p>
<p>was on he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>movie freak</p>
<p>and they were just</p>
<p>quoted all these</p>
<p>weird obscure</p>
<p>movies and weird</p>
<p>and i just didn&rsquo;t know anything</p>
<p>i was useless</p>
<p>they were like what&rsquo;s your favorite</p>
<p>movie i&rsquo;m like i don&rsquo;t have one</p>
<p>you have a favorite</p>
<p>movie i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i have a favorite movie man</p>
<p>right now it&rsquo;s avatar</p>
<p>just cause i i</p>
<p>never get that i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never felt like that before you know yeah i like in a</p>
<p>movie like wow like that movie like</p>
<p>even though it was dumb</p>
<p>you know even though it was like cliche</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t matter it&rsquo;s like felt</p>
<p>it felt so powerful</p>
<p>you know it</p>
<p>goes like move to tears almost a couple times it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>me even though it was</p>
<p>still it was like</p>
<p>comic book style but</p>
<p>super powerful</p>
<p>you know like the images and the way it was done</p>
<p>even though there was like some cliche shit in it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter man</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fucking awesome</p>
<p>did i get my tomahawk pipe yes i did sir</p>
<p>actually here it is</p>
<p>right here but we</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t used it because it&rsquo;s kind of weak</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very clogged</p>
<p>already yeah well it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s dumb</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s dumb you&rsquo;re not really supposed to</p>
<p>smoke out of it</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supposed to just go me and i&rsquo;ve got a camera</p>
<p>hog pipe man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s silly</p>
<p>but yeah i got it i got it just so i</p>
<p>could show you guys i got it</p>
<p>when did i start smoking weed i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>start till i was like 30 years old</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why i&rsquo;m so passionate about it</p>
<p>because my whole life</p>
<p>i thought that if you</p>
<p>smoke weed you&rsquo;d be lazy</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be a loser</p>
<p>because i knew a lot of dudes when i was a kid and</p>
<p>the guys that did drugs</p>
<p>the guys that were</p>
<p>partying all the time they always want to fucking</p>
<p>their lives up</p>
<p>and i was terrified of fucking my</p>
<p>life up there was my number one fear with being a loser</p>
<p>my number one</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t my ambition</p>
<p>was all fucked up because it wasn&rsquo;t that i wanted to be</p>
<p>happy and i wanted to you</p>
<p>know find some</p>
<p>place of some</p>
<p>point of success and</p>
<p>do you know</p>
<p>achieve some goal or you</p>
<p>know be the</p>
<p>something for a living that i wanted to be</p>
<p>i wasn&rsquo;t doing that i was just trying not to be a</p>
<p>loser i was terrified i was</p>
<p>gonna be a loser so</p>
<p>you know i think</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s it it&rsquo;s very important</p>
<p>to have the</p>
<p>right mindset</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you think like when you&rsquo;re growing up</p>
<p>how gigantic is that yeah</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s a lot with parents but also</p>
<p>you know just how you&rsquo;re raised and hold package</p>
<p>yeah and how people how you the people around you</p>
<p>think too that&rsquo;s very important man you know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t even remember what i was talking about</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how high we are</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>barbecued but we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about something real simple</p>
<p>what the hell</p>
<p>are we talking</p>
<p>about avatar and</p>
<p>by the way i finally sell the song 3d and i</p>
<p>loved it that fucking</p>
<p>movie was so</p>
<p>great it was the</p>
<p>greatest movie ever</p>
<p>to me i mean i say i don&rsquo;t have a favorite</p>
<p>movie but i</p>
<p>guess if i had to have a favorite</p>
<p>movie that&rsquo;s my favorite movie</p>
<p>any news i&rsquo;m brock</p>
<p>lesnar i heard</p>
<p>randy kotor</p>
<p>said he&rsquo;s back in the gym really yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>you know more important than anything</p>
<p>even if dude</p>
<p>never fights</p>
<p>again right</p>
<p>you know maybe he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>fight anymore now you know</p>
<p>the most important</p>
<p>thing is that he&rsquo;s healthy</p>
<p>and the most important</p>
<p>thing is you</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>learn something from this situation</p>
<p>eat your vegetables</p>

<p>cause i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>using chrome a lot lately</p>
<p>i like chrome a lot</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s the best so</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know batter</p>
<p>safari is the</p>
<p>best i gave up on firefox firefox has been the worst</p>
<p>lately firefox has just been slow as fuck</p>
<p>really yeah they used to be good</p>
<p>yeah firefox crashes sometimes on me</p>
<p>shut off firefox</p>
<p>i got all my</p>
<p>fancy new fucking badass</p>
<p>quick internet</p>
<p>it shouldn&rsquo;t be all gayed out yeah</p>
<p>a lot of people</p>
<p>got really mad at me i did an interview recently</p>
<p>and i talked</p>
<p>about the use of the word faggot</p>
<p>i was just explaining how what happened when i did the</p>
<p>spike tv thing</p>
<p>that they told me that i</p>
<p>could say any word</p>
<p>except faggot</p>
<p>when when the show was uncensored</p>
<p>and i was like this that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>crazy because i&rsquo;m not even talking to</p>
<p>a person i&rsquo;m talking to a dog and some</p>
<p>ants that&rsquo;s when i use the word fag</p>
<p>and it has nothing to do with</p>
<p>sexual orientation</p>
<p>you know and i know louis ck</p>
<p>actually has a</p>
<p>bid on that</p>
<p>about how it</p>
<p>never meant gay and it didn&rsquo;t anthony kumi</p>
<p>talks about it all the time</p>
<p>on opi and anthony</p>
<p>about how faggot</p>
<p>never really was a homosexual</p>
<p>slur when we were kids it was</p>
<p>it was not i mean but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sort of not true because you knew that</p>
<p>it also meant that</p>
<p>but people didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>use it that way that&rsquo;s not what it meant</p>
<p>and at the end of</p>
<p>the day like what&rsquo;s language is supposed to represent</p>
<p>is your the context of your thoughts</p>
<p>you know and the problem is when words get</p>
<p>hyperpowered</p>
<p>like cunt or nigger or faggot</p>
<p>now faggot is like the new one</p>
<p>you know or love loves a</p>
<p>hyper powered word too you know</p>
<p>these words get</p>
<p>hyper powered and the word itself</p>
<p>is more important than the meaning behind the word</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not it&rsquo;s not a true</p>
<p>expression anymore like</p>
<p>i mean a lot of people in relationships and you know</p>
<p>you say you love me tell me you love me or to love you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like this</p>
<p>weird fucking</p>
<p>magic word thing that you have to say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you</p>
<p>should know by the way someone</p>
<p>communicates with you whether or not they love you</p>
<p>they shouldn&rsquo;t have to say</p>
<p>this one word shouldn&rsquo;t have all this goddamn</p>
<p>power you know the same</p>
<p>thing with the word nigger and the same</p>
<p>thing with the word faggot</p>
<p>and now i guess</p>
<p>because this</p>
<p>gay guy told me when he was explaining this to me that</p>
<p>i couldn&rsquo;t say faggot</p>
<p>and even if i didn&rsquo;t mean anything he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mean gay people i couldn&rsquo;t say it because i&rsquo;m not gay</p>
<p>said but gay people</p>
<p>could say because he goes it&rsquo;s our nigger</p>
<p>why have guys kisses that&rsquo;s john</p>
<p>travolta who&rsquo;s he kissing john travolta</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know some dude he met</p>
<p>on the streets wow that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>shocking news obviously</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s great is gonna get me sued who&rsquo;s he kissing</p>
<p>obviously it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stage ladies and gentlemen well</p>
<p>this one&rsquo;s not stage</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>into an airplane kissing another gentleman</p>
<p>well you know maybe he likes kissing gentlemen</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s gay brian</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know where you&rsquo;re going with this listen</p>
<p>just cuz john travolta is kissing manny&rsquo;s photos</p>
<p>and one of the funniest things you ever</p>
<p>said dude was</p>
<p>do you wanna say</p>
<p>which john travolta is gayer than a room full of dicks</p>
<p>did i say that yeah in vegas i said one of my favorite</p>
<p>things here</p>
<p>well clearly i was just saying it in jest</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen i do not know who&rsquo;s homosexual</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a funny story that i&rsquo;ve told before</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s true story</p>
<p>there was a dude who was a fighter in this</p>
<p>organization</p>
<p>this other fighting organization outside of the ufc</p>
<p>and this was like the 90s and they want to do</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t a google search even it was an internet</p>
<p>search on this man&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>because they were gonna write a</p>
<p>story about him to promote his show</p>
<p>and as they were</p>
<p>searching him they</p>
<p>found out that someone with the same name</p>
<p>was a gay porn star</p>
<p>and not just a gay porn star</p>
<p>but the winner of the hungriest butt contest</p>
<p>not the runner up with a hungry spot contest</p>
<p>the fucking winner</p>
<p>this dude won the hungriest butt contest</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t believe it was him and then they just</p>
<p>started like</p>
<p>like searching more</p>
<p>and they found photos</p>
<p>and they found photos of him like one dudes in his</p>
<p>mouth one dudes in his ass</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re using him as like chinese finger handcuffs</p>
<p>and i mean they found all this porn on him like because</p>
<p>it was you know it was used pretty easy to find</p>
<p>you know when the information</p>
<p>first got on the internet</p>
<p>porn was the</p>
<p>first shit to get out there</p>
<p>porn was there before anything else</p>
<p>before wikipedia before</p>
<p>youtube porn was there</p>
<p>so if you had porn on the internet</p>
<p>you could basically get even</p>
<p>stuff that was illegal</p>
<p>like the early</p>
<p>tracy lords videos you could have got those</p>
<p>you could have got</p>
<p>those back but you can&rsquo;t get those now</p>
<p>you go looking for a</p>
<p>tracy lord&rsquo;s video</p>
<p>now anything that&rsquo;s illegal like that that shit is gone</p>
<p>but back then you</p>
<p>could get it</p>
<p>so gay porn</p>
<p>it was all over the place</p>
<p>this poor fuck</p>
<p>they pulled up all</p>
<p>these pictures</p>
<p>videos and everything</p>
<p>they confronted them</p>
<p>and it was like bullshit</p>
<p>and they showed him the</p>
<p>photos and he got all angry</p>
<p>and he was the headliner he was like the big draw</p>
<p>and he just explained that he</p>
<p>look he was down on his luck and it was a lot of money</p>
<p>it was a lot of money</p>
<p>and so he did it</p>
<p>well it turns out he did like a hundred</p>
<p>movies okay</p>
<p>i mean and the joke is how much</p>
<p>money is a lot of</p>
<p>money to you</p>
<p>cause if i think</p>
<p>you do one movie</p>
<p>you live like you&rsquo;re in a jay z</p>
<p>video for the rest of your life</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i think</p>
<p>you wanna do gay sex on</p>
<p>video what that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i gotta see some zeros</p>
<p>i gotta see a lot of commas</p>
<p>and a lot of zeros you know</p>
<p>but this fucking guy did like a lot of these</p>
<p>and my the joke is</p>
<p>a hundred and fifteen</p>
<p>videos by my accounts you</p>
<p>should have all the</p>
<p>money in the world</p>
<p>there should be no more</p>
<p>money left for anybody else</p>
<p>unless you like it</p>
<p>see if you like suck</p>
<p>index and if you&rsquo;re gay</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s not bad at all</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not see</p>
<p>this what people don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>like just because someone</p>
<p>thinks it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny because they personally are not they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna have gay sex</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s bad that</p>
<p>you have gay sex it&rsquo;s only bad for someone who doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna have the gay sex</p>
<p>right brian</p>
<p>like if you&rsquo;re not gay and you do a gay porn</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a big deal</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re gay and you do a gay porn</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like so what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sucking dicks</p>
<p>is it any more embarrassing that you&rsquo;re doing a video</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s no different but if you&rsquo;re straight</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re out there blowing guys on video ooh</p>
<p>i stupid about it in my act that</p>
<p>if a guy is like straight and he&rsquo;s born a guy</p>
<p>you know that if you like made a mistake one</p>
<p>night and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never win an argument ever for the rest of your life</p>
<p>because as soon as you get in the argument soon as shit</p>
<p>starts getting</p>
<p>real like man you don&rsquo;t believe people on the moon</p>
<p>like didn&rsquo;t you suck a dick once</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the end the</p>
<p>arguments over</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way you can bounce back from that</p>
<p>what you got a dick in your mouth</p>
<p>this conversations over</p>
<p>yeah you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>trust a judgment anymore you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>defeated him</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve deflated him as a human</p>
<p>do i feel very blessed to be as</p>
<p>famous as i am says genuine evil 86 that&rsquo;s hilarious</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just famous enough where it&rsquo;s not creepy</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>famous enough where no one takes me seriously</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>fear factor was</p>
<p>definitely a blessing in disguise</p>
<p>because you know i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>like you know you get to</p>
<p>a place where like a lot of people aren&rsquo;t like real</p>
<p>super famous people that are like</p>
<p>loved and worshipped like</p>
<p>you know rock stars or michael jackson</p>
<p>or something like that or tom cruise or brad pitt like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re prisoners</p>
<p>like they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>go anywhere like that is a terrible way to live</p>
<p>like yeah everybody is fascinated</p>
<p>by you including me if i saw brad pitt in a restaurant</p>
<p>i would like</p>
<p>point stare</p>
<p>like me you</p>
<p>wanna hear something</p>
<p>crazy me and</p>
<p>kevin james okay and</p>
<p>kevin james is fucking</p>
<p>famous right</p>

<p>and kevin and i are in boston and we&rsquo;re in a</p>
<p>hotel room and tom</p>
<p>cruise was in boston too and tom cruise is on the</p>
<p>street okay</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in kevin&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>hotel room and</p>
<p>kevin&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>tom cruise is out there look</p>
<p>and so we&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>leaning out the window</p>
<p>looking at tom cruise</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re on like the tenth</p>
<p>floor and shit and tom cruise is on the ground</p>
<p>floor and we&rsquo;re like looking at him across the</p>
<p>street like woo</p>
<p>like a movie star</p>
<p>is gawking at another movie star</p>
<p>it was pretty interesting to</p>
<p>watch i was like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re i go do you know you&rsquo;re that famous</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s not as</p>
<p>famous as tom cruise but he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fucking really</p>
<p>famous i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>silly that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like so fat but that&rsquo;s what it is man people people</p>
<p>are nutty about</p>
<p>about fame that&rsquo;s not a good</p>
<p>level you don&rsquo;t want to be there that</p>
<p>you want to be at the</p>
<p>level where you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>worry about your bills and you</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re able to do what you want to do</p>
<p>like as far as creatively</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s what i like i like the fact that i</p>
<p>could do comedy and</p>
<p>could do the ufc</p>
<p>i do what i want to do and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>enjoying myself you know and it&rsquo;s fun people</p>
<p>enjoy what i&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>and you know you develop fans you develop</p>
<p>people that are appreciating what you do and you</p>
<p>appreciate them</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a good relationship that&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>level of fame</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to be you know</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to be somewhere like</p>
<p>i was i was</p>
<p>watching some</p>
<p>video online</p>
<p>where the guy</p>
<p>can you put that</p>
<p>video up the dude when george bush went to</p>
<p>a restaurant</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s with five</p>
<p>secret service</p>
<p>agents and the guy</p>
<p>screaming and yelling</p>
<p>at him you fucking murderer you zionist murder and</p>
<p>piece of shit and</p>
<p>some guy george bush senior</p>
<p>has to the dude</p>
<p>is like he&rsquo;s an old man he&rsquo;s been around forever</p>
<p>he has to travel</p>
<p>everywhere with</p>
<p>these bodyguards</p>
<p>everywhere he goes he has</p>
<p>secret service guys surrounding him</p>
<p>and yeah i know what you&rsquo;re saying yeah</p>
<p>no he caused wars and he&rsquo;s responsible for all</p>
<p>these people dying i</p>
<p>see it a hundred percent</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not like being a</p>
<p>movie star but it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>thing in as far as like</p>
<p>well no because people are</p>
<p>angry at him okay</p>
<p>my point is terrible but</p>
<p>it is right</p>
<p>cause people are</p>
<p>angry at him i mean</p>
<p>the reason why he&rsquo;s got all</p>
<p>those people around is</p>
<p>cause people want him dead yeah</p>
<p>anybody who wants brad pitt dead is fucking</p>
<p>crazy but the</p>
<p>point is that any</p>
<p>level of fame</p>
<p>you know past a certain</p>
<p>level can be</p>
<p>it becomes a handicap</p>
<p>it becomes like food if you have some food</p>
<p>you should only eat</p>
<p>until you&rsquo;re not hungry anymore you</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t fucking gorge yourself and go goddamn crazy</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s very difficult to manage any</p>
<p>level of fame</p>
<p>and to manage the kind of fame that those guys</p>
<p>manage i mean it&rsquo;s almost impossible</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why why do you</p>
<p>think tom cruise is so crazy</p>
<p>you have to be crazy</p>
<p>no one cannot be</p>
<p>crazy if you&rsquo;re that</p>
<p>famous it&rsquo;s like impossible</p>
<p>like who can manage that kind of fame</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>when he was on matt</p>
<p>lau we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>psychiatrists and antidepressants like</p>
<p>matt your glib</p>
<p>your glib like he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even realize how retarded he</p>
<p>sounds no one tells him</p>
<p>no one tells him that he&rsquo;s talking nonsense he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a voice of reason around him he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>objectivity he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have anybody who talks to him real</p>
<p>he has people who gawk and stare</p>
<p>and look like</p>
<p>kevin james and i</p>
<p>from the fucking tenth</p>
<p>floor of a hotel</p>
<p>oh it&rsquo;s tom cruise</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s given that guy the real shit</p>
<p>so when he gets on</p>
<p>television and talks to nonsense</p>
<p>he has no idea what nonsense is</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s crazy because he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>super super</p>
<p>famous and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>almost impossible</p>
<p>to not be crazy</p>
<p>where all the rules</p>
<p>completely different</p>
<p>for you than they are for everybody else</p>
<p>the rules for everybody else</p>
<p>are totally</p>
<p>most people have to create an impression</p>
<p>they have you meet someone</p>
<p>that you know you tell them</p>
<p>what your name is what you&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>about with him</p>
<p>everywhere he goes they know everything</p>
<p>they know he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>scientologist</p>
<p>they know he&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>greatest fucking most successful</p>
<p>movie star in the history of the world</p>
<p>i mean that fucking guy can&rsquo;t go anywhere</p>
<p>everybody wants to say he&rsquo;s like five foot one and oh</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gay and he&rsquo;s fucking crazy</p>
<p>everybody staring and scrutinizing</p>
<p>them you know that marriage</p>
<p>that he had the</p>
<p>first one to cold kidman</p>
<p>that was all set up and i was not even real</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s constantly up in his shit how</p>
<p>could he not be</p>
<p>crazy right yeah</p>
<p>brian gets up</p>
<p>he gets a lot</p>
<p>of internet fame you got a lot of weirdos they get</p>
<p>upset at you</p>
<p>you got a lot of weird how</p>
<p>about that pepsi</p>
<p>spice thing</p>
<p>listen listen this story</p>
<p>this this dude</p>
<p>when pepsi remember</p>
<p>guys remember when</p>
<p>pepsi spice was around</p>
<p>well brian is like one of the</p>
<p>og internet gangsters</p>
<p>he was like</p>
<p>he was aware</p>
<p>of shit the companies</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t aware of</p>
<p>you know companies were like</p>
<p>these multi</p>
<p>multi billion dollar companies but they really weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>deep in the internet</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand the impact it had</p>
<p>so when pepsi</p>
<p>spice came out</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>pepsispice com</p>
<p>so brian bought</p>
<p>pepsispice com</p>
<p>and brian started putting up all these</p>
<p>crazy is it</p>
<p>still up or did you get sued</p>
<p>uh the website yeah i let it go because i was</p>
<p>tired of paying for it</p>
<p>and they weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>bringing back the</p>
<p>did you give it to them</p>
<p>no i just let it go i</p>
<p>think somebody</p>
<p>somebody else picked it up but what did you do with all</p>
<p>those crazy stories that you</p>
<p>wrote on it</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll tell everybody</p>
<p>about the stores</p>
<p>well pretty much i just</p>
<p>copied off that</p>
<p>morgan spurlock guy and i said that i was</p>
<p>going to drink</p>
<p>only pepsi holiday</p>
<p>spice for 30 days</p>
<p>for the people that don&rsquo;t know that&rsquo;s from</p>
<p>super size me</p>
<p>you ate mcdonald&rsquo;s</p>
<p>for 30 days it&rsquo;s a documentary pretty good one yeah</p>
<p>and so i had i</p>
<p>could only have pepsi</p>
<p>spice to eat and</p>
<p>drink for 30 days which is</p>
<p>alone the dumbest</p>
<p>thing in the</p>
<p>world that anyone believed it you know like i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to eat food</p>
<p>yeah so i started having like the</p>
<p>first couple days i</p>
<p>started having like these</p>
<p>like lesions</p>
<p>and stuff like</p>
<p>that and you</p>
<p>photoshopped</p>
<p>these things on yeah</p>
<p>yeah i made like fake</p>
<p>things i made myself look more and</p>
<p>more sick i was losing weight and i was showing like</p>
<p>i was photoshopping fat off me</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s crazy is then i</p>
<p>started getting interviews from</p>
<p>radio stations</p>
<p>thinking it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>real i have that somewhere like this two hour interview</p>
<p>where college</p>
<p>radio stations</p>
<p>thought it was real and i had</p>
<p>people actually i</p>
<p>started really</p>
<p>thinking i was like</p>
<p>dying and stuff like that and then</p>
<p>one day i just stopped like 20 days in</p>
<p>and people all thought i died</p>
<p>it was one of the great trolls</p>
<p>one of the all time great trolls</p>
<p>yeah it was really brilliant</p>
<p>yeah just look up</p>
<p>pepsi spice project it&rsquo;s been some</p>
<p>goddamn brilliant trolls</p>
<p>done on the internet</p>
<p>you know the best is doug stanhope</p>
<p>on baiting baiting org</p>
<p>doug stanhope</p>
<p>would go and bait pedophiles</p>
<p>and then write like i think they did a book</p>
<p>about it didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>they do a book they put in a book form i</p>
<p>think yeah i</p>
<p>think so i believe it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still available</p>
<p>on if you go to doug stanhope com</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll probably have a link to it somewhere because</p>
<p>one of the funniest things</p>
<p>that doug ever did</p>
<p>and he would pretend to be little girls</p>
<p>and lure pedophiles</p>
<p>and say like all kinds of fucked up shit</p>
<p>and it was really really</p>
<p>genius stuff</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t i can&rsquo;t pull any of the</p>
<p>quotes off the top of my head but i remember</p>
<p>really laughing really hard</p>
<p>wanting to do the same</p>
<p>thing but i don&rsquo;t have that kind of commitment</p>
<p>doug is doug is an animal he&rsquo;s a pit bull</p>
<p>the level commitment that he has towards</p>
<p>trolling i i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not into like goofing on people</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know why</p>
<p>like that like i get bored</p>
<p>i mean i i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>argue with people and i&rsquo;ll make fun of someone</p>
<p>but like pretending to be someone else</p>
<p>going back and forth</p>
<p>for whatever reason my</p>
<p>brain doesn&rsquo;t work that way you know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know why i don&rsquo;t get into</p>
<p>those trolls</p>
<p>but i love watching them</p>
<p>like that pepsi</p>
<p>spice one i love that one that was awesome</p>
<p>and doug&rsquo;s i love them</p>
<p>i just don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>my brain doesn&rsquo;t</p>

<p>for the show</p>
<p>and do it at a different time</p>
<p>all right now because i didn&rsquo;t look at this at all the</p>
<p>last time we did this i have to look at it now at your</p>
<p>yeah i made up a post on my message board</p>
<p>asking people</p>
<p>to put in questions</p>
<p>so because of that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna go there</p>
<p>right now and check out</p>
<p>what the questions are and</p>
<p>see if anybody had some cool shit because people are</p>
<p>upset that i</p>
<p>did it last week</p>
<p>but when i did</p>
<p>it last week i didn&rsquo;t answer any questions but</p>
<p>i mean i like</p>
<p>the questions and it&rsquo;s good to have the questions but</p>
<p>wanted to make this as</p>
<p>loose as possible</p>
<p>i want to make</p>
<p>this as much as whatever we feel like talking</p>
<p>about you know whatever whoever&rsquo;s here whatever</p>
<p>just let things come out</p>
<p>you know let and</p>
<p>answer twitter questions and all that shit</p>
<p>what are the best tips for</p>
<p>navigating a high dose mushroom trip</p>
<p>are you doing them regularly</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the first question</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t do them regularly</p>
<p>terrence mckenna who i learned everything i know</p>
<p>about psychedelics from that guy or at least</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where i started</p>
<p>is listening to what he had to say reading his books</p>
<p>but what he always said is that you</p>
<p>should do them in high doses and very rarely</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what he said</p>
<p>he said that psychedelic experiences</p>
<p>should be something where you do the right dose</p>
<p>and then you take a long time off and</p>
<p>sort of contemplate what happened</p>
<p>and i agree with that</p>
<p>the last time i did anything really</p>
<p>strong like dmt that was over two years ago</p>
<p>and it was because it was a</p>
<p>very very very profound</p>
<p>experience and i wanted to make sure</p>
<p>that i got as much out of it and it</p>
<p>understood it and</p>
<p>sort of deciphered it as much as i could and</p>
<p>applied it to my life as much as i could before</p>
<p>i just went to try to do it</p>
<p>again i&rsquo;m very serious about</p>
<p>psychedelic trips i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s play</p>
<p>i mean i think you can have a good time on</p>
<p>mushrooms with your buddies if you don&rsquo;t take too much</p>
<p>but i think you can get a lot out of</p>
<p>psychedelic trips where</p>
<p>you and i&rsquo;m not criticizing people</p>
<p>wanna do it for fun</p>
<p>because look i like to</p>
<p>drink for fun i</p>
<p>smoke pot for fun i</p>
<p>smoke pot both for</p>
<p>introspective quality</p>
<p>thinking and also for fun</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t if you</p>
<p>wanna do it for fun that&rsquo;s all good</p>
<p>but what i&rsquo;m saying is like</p>
<p>for me personally i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>learned a lot from</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>experiences and</p>
<p>what i believe is what terrence mckenna</p>
<p>has always said</p>
<p>is that you</p>
<p>should do them</p>
<p>very rarely</p>
<p>you do them and then you don&rsquo;t do shit for a</p>
<p>while and you think</p>
<p>about what the fuck you learned</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>if you really want to</p>
<p>prove yourself you&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>using it for</p>
<p>that reason to really expand your consciousness</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get anything out of it if you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>apply it to your life</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just have the</p>
<p>experience and then become some fucking shut in</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t interact with the rest of the</p>
<p>world because all you want to do is</p>
<p>you know go down your basement turn the</p>
<p>lights out and do mushrooms</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re not even a part of us anymore like</p>
<p>you should be able to</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to be able to function in both</p>
<p>worlds in the</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>world and in this</p>
<p>world you got to be able to</p>
<p>navigate both dimensions</p>
<p>and i think if you do too much</p>
<p>drugs if you do them all the time</p>
<p>you know you can you can</p>
<p>definitely lose</p>
<p>your your handle on this world</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s my answer to that question i</p>
<p>think if you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>anything consciousness expanding</p>
<p>you know and always do</p>
<p>things that have been</p>
<p>done for thousands and thousands of years i mean</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not telling you to do anything illegal but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stuff that you can do that isn&rsquo;t illegal they just</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t classified it yet</p>
<p>you know iwaska isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>technically illegal dmt is illegal</p>
<p>ayahuasca has even been sanctioned recently</p>
<p>some church in new mexico won a supreme court case</p>
<p>where they take dmt it&rsquo;s part of</p>
<p>their christian</p>
<p>church it&rsquo;s part of</p>
<p>their religious</p>
<p>ceremonies to get in</p>
<p>touch with god</p>
<p>yeah they want a supreme court case</p>
<p>very few people know</p>
<p>about it but</p>
<p>you got you</p>
<p>should know what the fuck you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the real problem with</p>
<p>psychedelics is that there are no shaman anymore</p>
<p>you know in the in</p>
<p>you know these</p>
<p>tribes in peru</p>
<p>and these people that live in the amazon</p>
<p>there there is like</p>
<p>a history of usage that goes back thousands of years</p>
<p>and they pass it on from</p>
<p>generation to</p>
<p>generation and the shaman</p>
<p>that people that brew this</p>
<p>ayahuasca is this very</p>
<p>powerful dose</p>
<p>of dmt that comes in an orally active form</p>
<p>and they get it from combining these</p>
<p>plants and boiling into this</p>
<p>crazy mixture</p>
<p>between that and there&rsquo;s also shaman in</p>
<p>other parts of the</p>
<p>world and mexico where they</p>
<p>their shaman</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>thing is mushrooms</p>
<p>and these are people that have navigated</p>
<p>these dimensions whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ayahuasca or mushrooms or peyote</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve navigated</p>
<p>these dimensions</p>
<p>many many many many times so they can tell you what to</p>
<p>expect there</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve learned from their</p>
<p>experiences and they can help you</p>
<p>you know i think that&rsquo;s the real problem is that</p>
<p>psychedelic drugs</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t necessarily bad for you they&rsquo;re just illegal</p>
<p>and when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>illegal they can be bad for you because</p>
<p>if you can get caught with them you can get locked up</p>
<p>your life can get fucked up if they find them</p>
<p>in your piss if you have to you know test</p>
<p>for some sort of a job and then also you</p>
<p>label the drug addict yeah</p>
<p>in that sense</p>
<p>psychedelic drugs can be bad</p>
<p>and the other</p>
<p>sense it&rsquo;s like look</p>
<p>a circular saw like one of those</p>
<p>those are awesome</p>
<p>if you know how to use one</p>
<p>you could build a</p>
<p>house you could fucking do some cool shit</p>
<p>you can cut some wood that you would</p>
<p>never be able to cut with like a</p>
<p>steak knife</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t mean everybody</p>
<p>should have a fucking circular saw and just be</p>
<p>using it all day</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>thing with mushrooms</p>
<p>mushrooms are just like any kind of tool</p>
<p>you can like like i say with marijuana with a hammer</p>
<p>you can build a</p>
<p>house with a hammer</p>
<p>or you can just</p>
<p>hit yourself in the dick if you&rsquo;re fucking crazy</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean that hammer</p>
<p>should be illegal</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>thing with psychedelic drugs i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t give</p>
<p>a circular saw to a 13 year old boy and say hey</p>
<p>go play with this</p>
<p>but if a guy is a goddamn carpenter</p>
<p>and he knows what he&rsquo;s doing and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gone up through</p>
<p>trade school</p>
<p>and he did an</p>
<p>apprenticeship and worked as a carpenter&rsquo;s</p>
<p>apprentice and</p>
<p>learned how to use tools properly and</p>
<p>learn the proper</p>
<p>safety precautions</p>
<p>then yeah that guy</p>
<p>should be able to hold a fucking</p>
<p>chainsaw that guy</p>
<p>should be able to use a circular saw</p>
<p>guy should be able to work in a machine shop</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s learned how to do it</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>thing with psychedelic drugs there</p>
<p>should be someone</p>
<p>showing you</p>
<p>the dangers in the pitfalls and what it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about because it&rsquo;s not simply</p>
<p>that easy it&rsquo;s not like you can just do them and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be okay</p>
<p>some people do</p>
<p>psychedelic drugs</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re so un</p>
<p>mentally prepared for it they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>never the same again</p>
<p>you know and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a real possibility and someone needs to be there to</p>
<p>evaluate whether or not you know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got the</p>
<p>proper information with your heads in the</p>
<p>right place</p>
<p>you know and that&rsquo;s why it</p>
<p>would help if we were more open</p>
<p>about these fucking things</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the nutty</p>
<p>thing is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still got this terrible</p>
<p>reputation and here we are you know in</p>
<p>2010 and i think the</p>
<p>reputation is all based on</p>
<p>the fact that we when we get something in our head we</p>
<p>stick with it</p>
<p>we get something</p>
<p>in our head even with all the information</p>
<p>like marijuana</p>
<p>still illegal</p>
<p>2010 in most</p>
<p>states it&rsquo;s illegal</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy when alcohol</p>
<p>and tobacco and all that shit is readily available</p>
<p>but we get it in our head that it&rsquo;s bad</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s been illegal all our lives</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very tough for us to change gears</p>
<p>and for a long time we&rsquo;ve had this</p>
<p>thing in our head</p>
<p>about psychedelic drugs</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>cultural pattern</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a lock we got talked into it when the</p>
<p>media was young</p>
<p>and when the newspapers were</p>
<p>around and that was the only way to get information out</p>
<p>they would publish</p>
<p>these stories</p>
<p>about marijuana</p>
<p>and the william</p>
<p>randolph hearst scandals</p>
<p>william randolph</p>
<p>hearst owned</p>
<p>not only did he own</p>
<p>newspapers but he also owned</p>
<p>paper mills</p>
<p>and when they invented the</p>
<p>decorticator</p>
<p>it made it more effective to process hemp fiber</p>
<p>and what he</p>
<p>started doing was attacking the hemp industry</p>
<p>so that he didn&rsquo;t have to change over his</p>
<p>paper mills from wood</p>
<p>to hemp paper</p>
<p>this hemp is a far superior paper</p>
<p>it makes superior clothing</p>
<p>you can eat it like this</p>
<p>it contains all the essential amino acids in the seeds</p>
<p>besides the fact that it gets you high</p>
<p>even take away the get you high part even</p>
<p>the plants that don&rsquo;t get you high at all are still</p>
<p>like really economically valuable</p>
<p>well william randolph</p>
<p>hearst attacked that industry</p>
<p>because he owned the newspapers</p>
<p>he started printing</p>
<p>these stories</p>
<p>saying that</p>
<p>blacks and mexicans were</p>
<p>smoking this new drug called marijuana and they were</p>
<p>going out and raping</p>
<p>white women</p>
<p>so because of that because he did this they all</p>
<p>you know people</p>
<p>got crazy and they all</p>
<p>got paranoid and</p>
<p>congress actually outlawed</p>
<p>marijuana not even knowing they were outlawing hemp</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t even know it was the same thing</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s how marijuana became illegal in the</p>
<p>first place and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still illegal</p>
<p>today is that once something is</p>
<p>stuck in our consciousness</p>
<p>it takes a long time to get it out</p>
<p>well i think that a long time</p>
<p>ago a long time ago it was probably very very common</p>
<p>in all cultures to have a shaman</p>
<p>to have some sort of</p>
<p>someone who is</p>
<p>aware of psychedelic</p>
<p>states john</p>
<p>marco allegro</p>
<p>he argues that that&rsquo;s what christianity is all about</p>
<p>the christianity is all</p>
<p>about concealing</p>
<p>these secrets of</p>
<p>consuming hallucinogenic drugs</p>
<p>he was a guy who deciphered the dead sea</p>
<p>scrolls john</p>
<p>marco allegro worked in the dead sea</p>
<p>scrolls for 14 years and</p>
<p>after he did all this deciphering i don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right neither do you</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re a biblical scholar</p>
<p>unless you can</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>have to be a master of ancient languages you have to</p>
<p>study it for decades to even</p>
<p>understand what the fuck he&rsquo;s talking about</p>
<p>i read it it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>makes sense sort of but</p>
<p>he could be totally bullshitting</p>
<p>but what his</p>
<p>story is was that</p>
<p>the entire christian religion was a</p>
<p>giant misunderstanding what it really was all</p>
<p>about was the consumption</p>
<p>of psychedelic mushrooms and fertility cults</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what it was all</p>
<p>about it was all</p>
<p>about breeding</p>
<p>babies and taking mushrooms</p>
<p>which makes</p>
<p>sense people</p>
<p>lived thousands</p>
<p>and thousands years ago and didn&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>the sky was they didn&rsquo;t have any science</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re popping mushrooms</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>other people to know how badass the mushrooms are</p>
<p>you eat mushrooms you see god</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>other people to know</p>
<p>about that so they</p>
<p>would hide it in stories it totally makes sense</p>
<p>some guy said i&rsquo;ve tried robitussin</p>
<p>what are you kitty dukakis pal drinking robitussin</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s drinking aftershave fell</p>
<p>agreed this guy says he hates everything in the radio</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t hate everything on the</p>
<p>radio but god damn i hate a lot of songs</p>
<p>i think this is just a certain reality</p>
<p>and like a lot of</p>
<p>rap and a lot of</p>
<p>classic rock</p>
<p>i like sound guard too i love</p>
<p>soundgarden i heard they&rsquo;re getting back together again</p>
<p>which i love</p>
<p>because i was not a fan</p>
<p>of that chris cornell shit on his own</p>
<p>yeah lately i haven&rsquo;t been a fan at all</p>
<p>he seems like a really</p>
<p>cool guy and he&rsquo;s talented as fuck as a singer but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like some bands</p>
<p>they get together they got a</p>
<p>magic you know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>even if they get back together i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s gonna be that good</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>i think i think a lot of bands like</p>
<p>soundgarden they were good</p>
<p>because they were</p>
<p>young and they were</p>
<p>doing drugs and</p>
<p>going crazy</p>
<p>and just experiencing life</p>
<p>now i think</p>
<p>these are just people that have slowed down slowed</p>
<p>their role and they&rsquo;re trying to be something or not</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>music just a lot of</p>
<p>these guys music just</p>
<p>you know i think that was kind of what i was talking</p>
<p>about earlier when i was saying that there&rsquo;s a certain</p>
<p>level that you reach as</p>
<p>a performer you know</p>
<p>if you get too</p>
<p>famous you get too</p>
<p>successful it&rsquo;s very hard to cope</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard to be</p>
<p>still creative and</p>
<p>still have enthusiasm</p>
<p>i mean how many guys</p>
<p>just get better and better</p>
<p>every album</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that many you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard to pull off</p>
<p>who do you think has ever done it the longest</p>
<p>most consistently</p>
<p>will zeppelin one of</p>
<p>those guys probably</p>
<p>the beatles did it forever right yeah</p>
<p>did they ever fall</p>
<p>apart they got better right yeah</p>
<p>they got back i think so</p>
<p>yeah they did right they got into their psychedelic</p>
<p>stage you know they&rsquo;re fucking the white album</p>
<p>stage plays rock</p>
<p>band better beatles rock band no it&rsquo;s great because you</p>
<p>start off like shitty beatles</p>
<p>songs and you&rsquo;re just like this song sucks whatever</p>
<p>and then you</p>
<p>start getting into like</p>
<p>psychedelic and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s cool the more you play the more into the music</p>
<p>well they didn&rsquo;t just see the</p>
<p>thing about the beatles was they didn&rsquo;t just change</p>
<p>their music</p>
<p>they changed like the</p>
<p>whole culture that was listening to them too</p>
<p>because people got swept up in</p>
<p>their music</p>
<p>you know people were such huge fans of john lennon</p>
<p>that when he</p>
<p>started getting into transcendental</p>
<p>meditation and</p>
<p>acid and you know hanging</p>
<p>out with gurus and shit they all got into it too like</p>
<p>he changed a lot of people&rsquo;s consciousness</p>
<p>that was a guy that really really affected</p>
<p>a lot of the way</p>
<p>our culture operates the way people</p>
<p>think michael jackson too</p>
<p>fuck yeah yeah</p>
<p>yeah michael jackson just from the</p>
<p>music like how</p>
<p>powerful it was</p>
<p>like bad and thriller</p>
<p>man when i was a kid</p>
<p>there was nothing that was more popular than that yeah</p>
<p>it was so recognized that his</p>
<p>talent was just so far and</p>
<p>above everyone else&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s like god it&rsquo;s so sad that he&rsquo;s such a</p>
<p>freak and he&rsquo;s so crazy</p>
<p>but the more i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>thinking lately</p>
<p>i think that when you get to</p>
<p>a certain level i</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s a certain</p>
<p>level of greatness</p>
<p>that some people achieve like a certain</p>
<p>frequency that some people achieve</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>impossible to achieve if you&rsquo;re not insane</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost impossible</p>
<p>to push yourself that far</p>
<p>that hard because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not easy to be like michael jackson</p>
<p>so fucking hard it&rsquo;s not just natural</p>
<p>talent it&rsquo;s a focus</p>
<p>and an energy</p>
<p>and that focus requires like</p>
<p>a very singular way of looking at</p>
<p>things and a very</p>
<p>a lot of sexual obsession</p>
<p>a lot of sexual abuse</p>
<p>i think that probably helps too</p>
<p>right dick&rsquo;s in the back of his</p>
<p>what do you think you</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s what happened with him you</p>
<p>think it was abused</p>
<p>when he was a kid i</p>
<p>think probably</p>
<p>i mean well it&rsquo;s all speculation they all were</p>
<p>it could have</p>
<p>been that he just got so fucked up because he got so</p>
<p>famous when he was so</p>
<p>young that he</p>
<p>never felt like he had a chance to</p>
<p>grow up and he wanted to go back to when he was a child</p>
<p>and he was just so psychologically</p>
<p>damaged that he</p>
<p>literally wanted to be around children</p>
<p>because he wanted to revert back</p>
<p>to that moment in his life before he realized that life</p>
<p>was haywire</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;ve thought that before</p>
<p>because you know what</p>
<p>the thing is</p>
<p>about all these</p>
<p>child molesting</p>
<p>accusations is that he was always around all</p>
<p>these poor kids and trying to help all</p>
<p>these kids with cancer and shit and people</p>
<p>who were broke</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>after a while i mean</p>
<p>these people like</p>
<p>all they have to do is say some crazy shit</p>
<p>about michael jackson</p>
<p>and you know it looks</p>
<p>weird why is</p>
<p>michael jackson hanging out with kids all the time</p>
<p>all i have to do is say some</p>
<p>crazy shit and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta pay you</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gotta pay you</p>
<p>start going to the newspaper</p>
<p>and to these people that were</p>
<p>super broke</p>
<p>i mean that</p>
<p>would be so tempting</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s this billionaire</p>
<p>the biggest</p>
<p>rock star music star in the history of the world</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s hanging out with your kid</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got your kid over for</p>
<p>sleepovers you</p>
<p>start i believe it though in some</p>
<p>but he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;m saying is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not like a whole</p>
<p>bunch of people coming out saying he fucked them</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t just fuck a couple kids</p>
<p>right you&rsquo;d be fucking kids all over the</p>
<p>place right</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re michael jackson you&rsquo;d be like the</p>
<p>tiger woods of kid fucking</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be just banging kids all over the place</p>
<p>if you got that obsession</p>
<p>where you want to have sex with kids</p>
<p>if you look at the</p>
<p>child molesters</p>
<p>like the recidivism rate is through the roof it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy it&rsquo;s like a 99</p>
<p>or something like that i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i just made</p>
<p>that number up it&rsquo;s real high though whatever it is</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve read it i don&rsquo;t remember what the numbers are but</p>
<p>people have said time and time</p>
<p>again it&rsquo;s very difficult to reform someone</p>
<p>so if he&rsquo;s like banging kids</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>gonna bang one or</p>
<p>two but that&rsquo;s why he had kids and he called the kid</p>
<p>blanket cause he&rsquo;s always on top of em just</p>
<p>seriously seriously though</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s i mean if you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>child molester</p>
<p>and you get caught</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t you have kids you&rsquo;re just saying it enough</p>
<p>yeah but you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>that no none of his kids have ever come out and accused</p>
<p>him of doing that you can&rsquo;t just say that you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re adding</p>
<p>them no you&rsquo;re making i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>saying that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just saying</p>
<p>you said that</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m gonna say that&rsquo;s what i believe in</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t believe me i believe that he probably</p>
<p>slept with kids</p>
<p>and he probably</p>
<p>kissed him but i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>doggy style</p>
<p>on the side of the bed or anything like that so you</p>
<p>think he just</p>
<p>did inappropriate shit yeah i bet he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>cause he thinks he&rsquo;s a kid you know</p>
<p>maybe yeah maybe</p>
<p>with molested that by his father growing up you</p>
<p>think so i bet that&rsquo;s what that was</p>
<p>because i mean</p>
<p>miley cyrus</p>
<p>would be fucking</p>
<p>black by now if that was true you know somebody</p>
<p>said this i don&rsquo;t know who said this but i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>not giving credit</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t remember who it was</p>
<p>they said that they</p>
<p>think that michael jackson</p>
<p>might have been castrated</p>
<p>they think that at a certain</p>
<p>point in time</p>
<p>michael jackson</p>
<p>might have been castrated</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why he</p>
<p>can sing at such a high pitch</p>
<p>even though he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>grown man that</p>
<p>might be why he&rsquo;s so fucked up sexually</p>
<p>and totally make sense</p>
<p>especially you look at his children</p>
<p>those are not his children i mean they&rsquo;re white kids</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re a hundred percent</p>
<p>white and he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>black man i mean he</p>
<p>might have paid for someone to have</p>
<p>those kids for but they&rsquo;re not his kids</p>
<p>you know and i think that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s real possible that that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>possible but it&rsquo;s speculation yeah but janet and</p>
<p>all kind of have that kind of</p>
<p>voice you know no</p>
<p>tito doesn&rsquo;t jermaine doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>those are men</p>
<p>you look at his brother</p>
<p>those are men</p>
<p>unless he&rsquo;s like some sort of</p>
<p>a biological</p>
<p>freak why does he have that</p>
<p>voice why is he look like that</p>
<p>why is he so</p>
<p>feminine why is his</p>
<p>voice so high pitched</p>
<p>even though he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>grown man i mean</p>
<p>could you imagine what if</p>
<p>what if i mean he&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>crazy with his fucking plastic surgery</p>
<p>what if he had some bad sexual</p>
<p>experiences when he was younger</p>
<p>and he just decided to castrate himself</p>
<p>i mean you look at what he does to his face yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not beyond the realm of question</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just making up fucking rumors</p>
<p>it works two hours in five minutes this is the goddamn</p>
<p>rumor show folks</p>
<p>what is that</p>
<p>this is my anger to one of</p>

<p>what i bang a sixteen year old no man</p>
<p>listen you know</p>
<p>they look hot that&rsquo;s a problem and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>ready to fuck they really are</p>
<p>you know what teenagers</p>
<p>i mean i&rsquo;m not saying anybody</p>
<p>should fuck them but when you</p>
<p>see a girl like when i was sixteen when i was sixteen</p>
<p>i was having sex</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t you i</p>
<p>i was having sex and my</p>
<p>girlfriend was 15 and she was</p>
<p>built like a woman</p>
<p>she looked like a</p>
<p>woman she had</p>
<p>tits and she had a big ass and it was a</p>
<p>woman and she wanted sex all the time</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>that shit is real you know</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s but you&rsquo;re not supposed to do it</p>
<p>doug stanhope has a joke</p>
<p>about it me and</p>
<p>brian me and ari</p>
<p>were talking</p>
<p>about on the plane</p>
<p>ari told me the joke that doug said</p>
<p>and apparently doug said you know</p>
<p>you know you say that they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>they that they&rsquo;re 16 years old they shouldn&rsquo;t be having</p>
<p>babies well</p>
<p>guess what god disagrees</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why they can get pregnant</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a really good point yeah</p>
<p>you know i mean that&rsquo;s really true but no i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have sex with a 16 year old that&rsquo;s a child</p>
<p>you know even i mean</p>
<p>even if a girl is like</p>
<p>twenty like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m forty fucking two years old</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;ve heard of dudes that are like my</p>
<p>age that have like</p>
<p>twenty year old</p>
<p>girlfriends and everybody laughs</p>
<p>about it like wow look at that guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got we have a</p>
<p>buddy that has a wife and his wife&rsquo;s nineteen</p>
<p>you know and he&rsquo;s in his forties it&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>but you know what</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s them</p>
<p>they like it and they have a good time i</p>
<p>have a hard time talking to people</p>
<p>you know i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i mean if i&rsquo;m living with someone they have to be smart</p>
<p>i mean i need someone who has some</p>
<p>experience and some</p>
<p>information you have to be on the same</p>
<p>level as me</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s something that you deny</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re younger but you realize when you get older</p>
<p>is that when you fuck</p>
<p>when you have sex with someone</p>
<p>even though you like to</p>
<p>think that it&rsquo;s just physical you just getting it</p>
<p>you blow a load</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that simple there&rsquo;s some sort of a</p>
<p>weird connection that</p>
<p>human beings make</p>
<p>when they fuck</p>
<p>and especially</p>
<p>when you do it to someone who&rsquo;s young</p>
<p>like they we</p>
<p>learn how to ignore that</p>
<p>connection and we</p>
<p>learn how to like</p>
<p>push each other away when we get</p>
<p>older we learn how to separate and</p>
<p>and get you know just deal with it</p>
<p>about like physically</p>
<p>but when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>young like you</p>
<p>get so attached you remember how attached to her the</p>
<p>first person you had sex with</p>
<p>holy shit unless that person&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>total douchebag</p>
<p>you know you like it really like hooked on them</p>
<p>like puppy love is brutal</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what they call</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re inexperienced in the incredible connection</p>
<p>and you as you get</p>
<p>older you learn how to manage that</p>
<p>connection but the</p>
<p>connection is real</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>grown adult</p>
<p>and you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>especially if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a position to take advantage of this kid</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>young and naive and</p>
<p>silly and you&rsquo;re fucking them</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a weird</p>
<p>thing you know</p>
<p>then again a lot of</p>
<p>twenty year olds are</p>
<p>horny as fuck</p>
<p>and they want some dick</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not telling you what to do</p>
<p>do whatever you want to do but to me</p>
<p>why not you know</p>
<p>girls eighteen that&rsquo;s like a baby to me it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>child i like</p>
<p>women you know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t like them old</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t even like my age</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s women are more fun</p>
<p>i like people talk to people don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>some dude josh jitsu says i&rsquo;m twenty three</p>
<p>well good for you you young little whippersnapper</p>
<p>when i was twenty three i was fucking retarded</p>
<p>all right i was a complete total dumbass</p>
<p>so i hope you were smarter than me sir because</p>
<p>life can be tough when you&rsquo;re stupid</p>
<p>you know and if you we all come from a different</p>
<p>place you know we all have a different</p>
<p>you know different</p>
<p>starting point that&rsquo;s what it is you know</p>
<p>some people</p>
<p>their parents are super cool and real open and</p>
<p>their dads their best friend and</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>their dad was you know</p>
<p>very educated</p>
<p>and intelligent and raised them you know very</p>
<p>in a very smart way</p>
<p>and i know that person is a huge head start</p>
<p>huge huge huge head</p>
<p>start in life if your parents are cool</p>
<p>my parents are</p>
<p>divorced when i was a little kid my you know my stepdad</p>
<p>came in the</p>
<p>picture when i was</p>
<p>seven he was</p>
<p>twenty four</p>
<p>and imagine if you were</p>
<p>twenty four years</p>
<p>old and you know actually i was five when he came into</p>
<p>picture you were</p>
<p>twenty four years old and</p>
<p>you have a fucking</p>
<p>five year old kid hanging around with you</p>
<p>you know so if he came in the</p>
<p>picture when i was five then he was like</p>
<p>twenty two that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>young as fuck</p>
<p>you know to be</p>
<p>that young and</p>
<p>to be around someone else&rsquo;s kid someone else&rsquo;s</p>
<p>loud ass kid</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s hard to deal with</p>
<p>so a lot of you out there</p>
<p>maybe you my</p>
<p>twenty three year old friend</p>
<p>maybe you have a head</p>
<p>start you know</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>smarter than me when you were 23 than when i was 23</p>
<p>but i think</p>
<p>what what i was talking</p>
<p>about recently with a friend of mine</p>
<p>was that guys like michael</p>
<p>jackson or you know or anybody that i know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>exceptional</p>
<p>almost everybody i know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>exceptional in anything had kind of a fucked up</p>
<p>childhood i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>weird you know</p>
<p>people that i know that are</p>
<p>like all my friends that are like really good comics</p>
<p>all my friends that are</p>
<p>like really good artists</p>
<p>all of them had fucked up childhoods</p>
<p>what are you doing showing the beginning</p>
<p>thing again</p>
<p>showing the beginning</p>
<p>thing again yeah</p>
<p>that beginning</p>
<p>thing&rsquo;s pretty badass</p>
<p>i think you know</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s horrible</p>
<p>you know that people have fucked up</p>
<p>childhoods but i think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>something that comes out of that right</p>
<p>yeah like when you&rsquo;re in balanced it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>your your ride is so much rockier</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s so much more energy behind it it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>if you can get</p>
<p>a hold of it and and control your personality and</p>
<p>and figure out a way to stabilize it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you have so much more thrust</p>
<p>than a person is content</p>
<p>but it might be unhealthy</p>

<p>still is an awesome boxer</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s really into it if he&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>into it he&rsquo;s a fucking you know he&rsquo;s a fucking champion</p>
<p>a guy&rsquo;s so good at boxing he can get</p>
<p>wrestling if you really who knows</p>
<p>maybe he&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>watching this</p>
<p>shit for years we don&rsquo;t know everybody&rsquo;s talking shit</p>
<p>he might have been</p>
<p>secretly working on his</p>
<p>wrestling he</p>
<p>might have a six brawl</p>
<p>if you gotta</p>
<p>stand up with that dude he&rsquo;s got four</p>

<p>you only took a couple of</p>
<p>those bitches</p>
<p>are you on page</p>
<p>three yet no</p>
<p>well i have</p>
<p>everything set up so there&rsquo;s a hundred images</p>
<p>or a hundred posts why</p>
<p>am i excited</p>
<p>about coming to toronto have i ever been no i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never been to toronto and i can&rsquo;t fucking wait</p>
<p>your wife has nice tits madapoo</p>
<p>very nice tits</p>
<p>he told me to say that</p>
<p>he said tell my wife she has nice tits</p>
<p>she does she has nice tits</p>
<p>congratulations sir</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m reading the page man</p>
<p>you not see</p>
<p>he said i&rsquo;m just seeing if he&rsquo;s reading the page really</p>
<p>he had to say</p>
<p>that because you didn&rsquo;t want to be bragging</p>
<p>about your wife&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tits you know</p>
<p>what does it say</p>
<p>about being drunk is better</p>
<p>smoking weed and fucking is just awesome</p>
<p>being drunk is better when it comes to eating</p>
<p>pussy though really</p>
<p>not in my opinion</p>
<p>in my opinion being</p>
<p>drunk is better when it comes to eating ass</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the only time i do it</p>
<p>cause i never eat ass when i&rsquo;m sober</p>
<p>the only time you eat ass when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sober is when you just got out of jail</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re when you&rsquo;re high</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to eat ass either but i i&rsquo;ll eat the fuck out of some</p>
<p>pussy when i&rsquo;m hot mmm</p>
<p>you just you like</p>
<p>it depends if</p>
<p>megan fox ass i&rsquo;ll eat that anytime of it</p>
<p>yeah anytime</p>
<p>of the day eat that ass fuck yeah what if it&rsquo;s all poo</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t care no you even wipe it off</p>
<p>or just dive in there oh</p>
<p>wipe it off with your mouth i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>start with the hair</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s why i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s important to drink</p>
<p>drinking the reason why</p>
<p>drinking and eating ass</p>
<p>goes in hand in hand is the alcohol kills the e coli</p>
<p>i mean when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>drinking jack and cokes and you eating ass</p>
<p>the alcohol is killing any bad bacteria that alcohol is</p>
<p>flushed your whole</p>
<p>system with poison</p>
<p>nothing&rsquo;s growing in that</p>
<p>no no bacteria</p>
<p>is gonna take hold</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna get swallowed up in that</p>
<p>whole antiseptic</p>
<p>chemical reaction</p>
<p>that the jack and coke has</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why you really</p>
<p>think you can eat ass when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on jack and coke</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re high you don&rsquo;t want to eat ass</p>
<p>but when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>high like this is probably not the best idea</p>
<p>what if i get sick</p>
<p>you know where you put like</p>
<p>metal in there and it</p>
<p>cleans the metal did you see</p>
<p>know that what</p>
<p>if you take jewelry and put it in a can of coke</p>
<p>it just dissolves all this shit</p>
<p>out of coke in a frog</p>
<p>yeah if you</p>
<p>put a frog in a</p>
<p>thing of coke like a dead frog</p>
<p>it just eats all</p>
<p>the skin away and just bone makes it bone is that true</p>
<p>folks or is that one of those</p>
<p>those dude that</p>
<p>looks dangerous</p>
<p>because i heard that the taking the</p>
<p>paint off cars was bullshit is that bullshit</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think so</p>
<p>snopes anyone do</p>
<p>you know one of the best</p>
<p>things to clean your</p>
<p>grill is coke</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>damn in a rag</p>
<p>but you know what</p>
<p>the doctors when you having like a fucking</p>
<p>barbecue sandwich</p>
<p>a nice goddamn cold coke</p>
<p>tastes pretty fucking delicious</p>
<p>right so barbecue pork pulled pork sandwich mmm</p>
<p>all right ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be the end we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna take one more question so we end on a high note</p>
<p>but we are enjoying the fuck out of this</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s this to disclosure product has 400</p>
<p>witnesses proving</p>
<p>et life exists</p>
<p>even astronauts</p>
<p>listen just</p>
<p>cause you have 400 people saying</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve seen ufos that does not mean there&rsquo;s ufos</p>
<p>that means you</p>
<p>have 400 people that say they&rsquo;ve seen ufos</p>
<p>and they might really believe they seen ufos</p>
<p>but you know they have a real problem that hunters</p>
<p>have a real problem and</p>
<p>this happens all over the</p>
<p>world where</p>
<p>the most experienced hunters</p>
<p>are the ones</p>
<p>that wind up accidentally killing people</p>
<p>and the reason being is that</p>
<p>these guys when</p>
<p>your experienced hunter</p>
<p>you know that sometimes your window of opportunity</p>
<p>where you get a shot at a deer</p>
<p>is real short</p>
<p>you gotta be able to</p>
<p>react the deers</p>
<p>right there through the trees</p>
<p>done you gotta be able to shoot</p>
<p>and people see</p>
<p>things that aren&rsquo;t there</p>
<p>and one of the</p>
<p>things they all say</p>
<p>universally</p>
<p>when they have an accident</p>
<p>and these are like good people church</p>
<p>going people no anger</p>
<p>no violence issues</p>
<p>guys are just love hunting</p>
<p>they say they</p>
<p>swear they saw a deer they</p>
<p>swear they saw a deer</p>
<p>one guy accidentally shot this son</p>
<p>this woman in maine</p>
<p>and she had</p>
<p>white mittens on</p>
<p>and he is following a deer</p>
<p>and this lady was in the woods and she had her</p>
<p>white mittens on</p>
<p>and he saw that</p>
<p>white and he said he saw the buck</p>
<p>he said he saw it</p>
<p>he said it was</p>
<p>right there in</p>
<p>front of him</p>
<p>and he said he</p>
<p>squeezed off the trigger</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t fully</p>
<p>understand how</p>
<p>the our consciousness</p>
<p>and our imagination affects what we see</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still very much</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>tricky to it</p>
<p>hallucinations and the bill to see</p>
<p>things that aren&rsquo;t there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>and if someone&rsquo;s in a very heightened state</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re in a very heightened</p>
<p>state like if they&rsquo;re in the heightened state of</p>
<p>wanting to see a deer</p>
<p>or if they&rsquo;re in the heightened</p>
<p>state of being in the woods in the dark and you</p>
<p>think you see a</p>
<p>monster you can see a fucking monster</p>
<p>you can really see it</p>
<p>you can convince yourself that you&rsquo;ve actually seen it</p>
<p>if you see something</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t know what it is</p>
<p>you will turn it into your mind and make it a</p>
<p>monster if you&rsquo;re out in the woods and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pitch black</p>
<p>and you stumble into a wild boar</p>
<p>and you barely see it</p>
<p>and it makes</p>
<p>noise and runs away</p>
<p>you could it</p>
<p>could be some</p>
<p>too you know</p>
<p>too fucking</p>
<p>foot tall troll man</p>
<p>with you know</p>
<p>giant fucking</p>
<p>furry feet and glowing eyes you</p>
<p>could make something up in your head</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>the human imagination and</p>
<p>human memory are not totally to be trusted</p>
<p>so unless they have actual evidence</p>
<p>listening to anybody talk</p>
<p>about ufos you have to listen to them and go</p>
<p>hmm maybe maybe</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not saying that you can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>you know here from</p>
<p>other planets i mean if you are so sophisticated</p>
<p>that you can</p>
<p>travel to this</p>
<p>world from another galaxy or another</p>
<p>solar system</p>
<p>why wouldn&rsquo;t you be so sophisticated that you</p>
<p>could hide why</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t you be so sophisticated</p>
<p>that your ufo is</p>
<p>completely invisible</p>
<p>why wouldn&rsquo;t you be totally undetectable</p>
<p>why wouldn&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>mean maybe they</p>
<p>would just have</p>
<p>everything completely mastered</p>
<p>the idea that</p>
<p>you know they</p>
<p>would show themselves</p>
<p>and look like they&rsquo;re dangling on a string</p>
<p>allow people to take</p>
<p>pictures and</p>
<p>you know and they oh</p>
<p>maybe they wanted us to see them</p>
<p>really and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how they did it they just showed up in some</p>
<p>weird obscure</p>
<p>place where</p>
<p>you know no</p>
<p>no no come on man</p>
<p>no that&rsquo;s not what they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>if there really are</p>
<p>aliens they&rsquo;re probably so alien</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t even recognize them</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re probably</p>
<p>i think that what we recognize is what we see in our</p>
<p>dimension what we see in our environment we see in our</p>
<p>world i think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably life forms out there that exist</p>
<p>that are so</p>
<p>alien to us we don&rsquo;t even have the</p>
<p>senses to detect them</p>
<p>you know and the way i&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about this before and i was talking</p>
<p>about farts</p>
<p>and that by when someone farts</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have a nose you have no idea it stinks</p>
<p>you there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>literally something</p>
<p>going around you that&rsquo;s invisible</p>
<p>and this sense that you have tunes into it</p>
<p>how do we not know that there are an infinite amount of</p>
<p>things that we cannot detect</p>
<p>that are around us all the time we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just guesswork</p>
<p>because something&rsquo;s not on the same</p>
<p>frequency as us</p>
<p>something&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>solid it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>tangible you can&rsquo;t bang on it because</p>
<p>just because of that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not real</p>
<p>and if there are</p>
<p>aliens they&rsquo;re probably so fucking alien</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t even see</p>
<p>them they&rsquo;re probably on a totally different</p>
<p>frequency than we are</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not buying all</p>
<p>these dudes that say they&rsquo;ve seen ufos</p>
<p>cause they really</p>
<p>wanna see ufos</p>
<p>these motherfuckers</p>
<p>want to see it</p>
<p>they have all had</p>
<p>experiences and something&rsquo;s happened to them</p>
<p>but they want to see ufos</p>
<p>they want so bad they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>given up on</p>
<p>their jobs they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>given up on</p>
<p>their careers</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve decided to pursue</p>
<p>ufology full time</p>
<p>they make youtube</p>
<p>videos constantly they do conferences and seminars</p>
<p>they have a</p>
<p>lot of vested interests involved in the idea of flying</p>
<p>saucers and</p>
<p>ships from other planets coming to this earth</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>psychological</p>
<p>things you have to take into consideration like why</p>
<p>these people want to see</p>
<p>these things</p>
<p>and when these</p>
<p>experiences happen</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>thing people have individual</p>
<p>experiences</p>
<p>especially alien abduction</p>
<p>experiences</p>
<p>most of those</p>
<p>things come in the middle of the night</p>
<p>while people are dreaming</p>
<p>and when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dreaming in the middle of the night your</p>
<p>brain is producing all sorts of</p>
<p>psychedelic chemicals</p>
<p>including dmt</p>
<p>the most potent</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>known to man is produced</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>heavy rem sleep</p>
<p>so when these people are having</p>
<p>these alien abduction</p>
<p>experiences</p>
<p>how do you not know that it&rsquo;s not your imagination</p>
<p>mixed in with</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>drugs that you don&rsquo;t even know you&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>these things and your</p>
<p>brain is producing</p>
<p>them and you&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>these incredible fucking</p>
<p>psychedelic trips and</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re halfway into a</p>
<p>dream and you wake up</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>tripping out of</p>
<p>these chemicals in your fucking</p>
<p>brain and you</p>
<p>start creating</p>
<p>all these scenarios with your imagination next</p>
<p>thing you know you&rsquo;re on a</p>
<p>spaceship why because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in the middle of a fucking natural dmt trip</p>
<p>and if you smoke</p>
<p>tnt i&rsquo;m just dumb people that want</p>
<p>money joe actually</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some people that aren&rsquo;t dumb though</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some people that aren&rsquo;t dumb that have real</p>
<p>experiences</p>
<p>know i&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>their interviews i&rsquo;ve read</p>
<p>stuff they have i&rsquo;ve read all the john mac books</p>
<p>john pay attention whores</p>
<p>some of them yes</p>
<p>they vary it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s no one</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t generalize</p>
<p>people have had ufo</p>
<p>experiences</p>
<p>but the any</p>
<p>any supernatural phenomenal</p>
<p>out of the ordinary</p>
<p>experience has to be considered</p>
<p>in all sorts of different ways</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s the evidence and what else</p>
<p>could it have been</p>
<p>and when you look at</p>
<p>what time these</p>
<p>things are taking</p>
<p>place almost universally they take</p>
<p>place late at</p>
<p>night when people</p>
<p>especially alien abduction</p>
<p>experiences</p>
<p>almost universally take</p>
<p>place late at</p>
<p>night and when</p>
<p>these people have</p>
<p>these experiences they&rsquo;re all like sleeping</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>half out of it and something happens to them</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s much more likely an endogenous dump of</p>
<p>psychedelic chemicals</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen i&rsquo;m no</p>
<p>expert my disclaimer</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what the fuck i&rsquo;m talking</p>
