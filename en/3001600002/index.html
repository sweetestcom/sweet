<p>(audience cheers)</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re back.</p>
<p>(audience applauds and cheers)</p>
<p>Our first live event in almost four years.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t given a public
speech in four years.</p>
<p>Wish me luck.</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<p>I have a lot to tell
you, very little time,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s get going.</p>
<p>Ray Tracing,</p>
<p>simulating the characteristics
of light and materials</p>
<p>is the ultimate accelerated
computing challenge.</p>
<p>Six years ago we demonstrated
for the very first time</p>
<p>rendering this scene
in less than few hours.</p>
<p>After a decade of research,</p>
<p>we were able to render
this scene in seconds,</p>
<p>15 seconds on our highest
end GPU six years ago.</p>
<p>And then we invented Nvidia RTX</p>
<p>and combined three
fundamental technologies,</p>
<p>hardware accelerated rate tracing,</p>
<p>artificial intelligence</p>
<p>processing on Nvidia Tensor core GPUs,</p>
<p>and brand new algorithms.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the
difference in just five years,</p>
<p>roll it.</p>
<p>This is running on CUDA GPUs six years ago</p>
<p>rendering this beautiful image</p>
<p>that would&rsquo;ve otherwise taken
a couple of hours on a CPU.</p>
<p>So this was a giant breakthrough already,</p>
<p>enormous speed up running
on accelerated computing.</p>
<p>And then we invented the RTX GPU.</p>
<p>Run it, please.</p>
<p>(upbeat music plays)</p>
<p>The holy grail of computer
graphics, Ray tracing,</p>
<p>is now possible in real time.</p>
<p>This is the technology
we have put into RTX</p>
<p>and this after five years</p>
<p>is a very important time for us</p>
<p>because for the very first time</p>
<p>we took our third generation
ADA architecture, RTX GPUs</p>
<p>and brought it to the
mainstream with two new products</p>
<p>that are now completely in production.</p>
<p>Are you?</p>
<p>I got that backwards.</p>
<p>Everything looks different
inside out and upside down.</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>Okay, this is our brand new,</p>
<p>right here you&rsquo;re looking at an ADA GPU</p>
<p>running ray tracing and
artificial intelligence</p>
<p>at 60 frames a second.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 14 inch, it weighs almost nothing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more powerful than
the highest end PlayStation</p>
<p>and this is the RTX 4060
Ti for our core gamers.</p>
<p>Both of these are now in production.</p>
<p>Our partners here in Taiwan are producing</p>
<p>both of these products in
very, very large productions</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m really excited about &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<p>I can almost put this in my pocket.</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>AI made it possible for us to do that.</p>
<p>Everything that you saw</p>
<p>would&rsquo;ve been utterly
impossible without AI.</p>
<p>For every single pixel we render,</p>
<p>we use AI to predict seven others.</p>
<p>For every pixel we compute,</p>
<p>AI predicted seven others.</p>
<p>The amount of energy we save,</p>
<p>the amount of performance
we get is incredible.</p>
<p>Now of course,</p>
<p>I showed you the performance
on those two GPUs,</p>
<p>but it wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible</p>
<p>if not for the super
computer back at Nvidia</p>
<p>running all the time training the model</p>
<p>so that we can enhance applications.</p>
<p>So the future is what I
demonstrated to you just now,</p>
<p>you can extrapolate almost everything</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m gonna talk about
for the rest of the talk</p>
<p>into that simple idea</p>
<p>that there will be a large
computer writing software</p>
<p>developing and deploying
software that is incredible,</p>
<p>that can be deployed in
devices all over the world.</p>
<p>We used AI to render this scene.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna also use AI to bring it alive.</p>
<p>Today we&rsquo;re announcing Nvidia
ACE, Avatar Cloud Engine,</p>
<p>that is designed for animating</p>
<p>to bringing a digital avatar to life.</p>
<p>It has several characteristics,
several capabilities,</p>
<p>speech recognition, text-to-speech,</p>
<p>natural language understanding,</p>
<p>basically a large language model,</p>
<p>and using the sound</p>
<p>that you will be
generating with your voice,</p>
<p>animate the face</p>
<p>and using the sound and the
expression that you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>animate your gestures.</p>
<p>All of this is completely trained by AI.</p>
<p>We have a service that
includes pre-trained models</p>
<p>that you can come, developers can come,</p>
<p>and modify and enhance
for your own application,</p>
<p>for your own story because every
game has a different story.</p>
<p>And then you can deploy it in the cloud</p>
<p>or deploy it on your device.</p>
<p>Has a great backend, has a TensorRT.</p>
<p>TensorRT is Nvidia&rsquo;s deep
learning, optimizing compiler,</p>
<p>and you could deploy it on Nvidia GPUs</p>
<p>as well as output Onyx, an
industry standard backend,</p>
<p>so that you can run it on any device.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at this
scene in just a second,</p>
<p>but let me first tell you about it.</p>
<p>It is completely rendered
with Ray tracing.</p>
<p>Notice the beautiful lights,</p>
<p>so many different lights</p>
<p>and all of the different lights</p>
<p>are projecting light from that source.</p>
<p>So you have all kinds of direct lights,</p>
<p>you have global illumination.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna see incredibly beautiful</p>
<p>shadows and physics simulation</p>
<p>and notice the character,</p>
<p>the beautiful rendering of the character.</p>
<p>Everything is done in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>We partnered with a avatar framework,</p>
<p>an avatar tool maker called (indistinct),</p>
<p>and together we developed
this demo you&rsquo;re about to see.</p>
<p>Okay, run please.</p>
<p>(upbeat music plays)</p>
<p>Everything is real time.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hey Jen, how are you?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unfortunately not so good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How come?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m worried about the crime around here?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotten bad lately.</p>
<p>My ramen shop got caught in the crossfire.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Can I help?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to do something about this,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I have heard rumors that the
powerful crime lord Kumon Aoki</p>
<p>is causing all sorts of chaos in the city.</p>
<p>He may be the root of this violence.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk to him, where can I find him?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have heard he hangs out</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>in the underground fight
clubs on the city&rsquo;s east side.</p>
<p>Try there.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ll go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be careful, Kai.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>None of that conversation was scripted.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We gave that AI, this Gin
AI character, a backstory,</p>
<p>his story about his ramen shop</p>
<p>and the story of this game.</p>
<p>And all you have to do is go
up and talk to this character.</p>
<p>And because this character</p>
<p>has been infused with
artificial intelligence</p>
<p>and large language models,</p>
<p>it can interact with you,</p>
<p>understand your meaning
and interact with you</p>
<p>in a really reasonable way.</p>
<p>All of the facial animation
completely done by the AI,</p>
<p>we have made it possible</p>
<p>for all kinds of
characters to be generated.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all domain,</p>
<p>they have their own domain knowledge.</p>
<p>You can customize it,</p>
<p>so everybody&rsquo;s games different</p>
<p>and look how wonderfully
beautiful they are</p>
<p>and natural they are.</p>
<p>This is the future of video games.</p>
<p>Not only will AI
contribute to the rendering</p>
<p>and the synthesis of the environment,</p>
<p>AI will also animate the characters.</p>
<p>AI will be a very big part
of the future of video games.</p>
<p>The most important computer</p>
<p>of our generation is
unquestionably the IBM System/360.</p>
<p>This computer revolutionized
several things.</p>
<p>The first computer in history</p>
<p>to introduce the concept of
a central processing unit,</p>
<p>the CPU,</p>
<p>virtual memory,</p>
<p>expandable I/O,</p>
<p>multitasking,</p>
<p>the ability to scale this computer</p>
<p>for different applications</p>
<p>across different computing ranges.</p>
<p>And one of the most
important contributions</p>
<p>and one of its greatest insights</p>
<p>is the importance of
preserving software investment.</p>
<p>The software ran across the
entire range of computers</p>
<p>and it ran across multiple generations.</p>
<p>So that the software you develop,</p>
<p>IBM recognized the importance of software,</p>
<p>recognized the importance of
preserving your investment,</p>
<p>and very importantly</p>
<p>recognized the importance
of installed base.</p>
<p>This computer revolutionized
not only computing</p>
<p>and many of us grew up reading
the manuals of this computer</p>
<p>to understand how computer
architecture worked,</p>
<p>to even learn about DMA
for the very first time,</p>
<p>this computer not only
revolutionized computing,</p>
<p>it revolutionized the thinking
of the computer industry.</p>
<p>System/360 and the programming
model of the System/360</p>
<p>has largely retained
until today, 60 years.</p>
<p>In 60 years a trillion dollars worth</p>
<p>of the world&rsquo;s data center</p>
<p>all basically used a computing model</p>
<p>that was innovated all
the way 60 years ago.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>There are two fundamental transitions</p>
<p>happening in the computer industry today.</p>
<p>All of you are deep
within it and you feel it.</p>
<p>There are two fundamental trends.</p>
<p>The first trend is because
CPU scaling has ended,</p>
<p>the ability to get 10
times more performance</p>
<p>every five years has ended.</p>
<p>The ability to get 10
times more performance</p>
<p>every five years at the same cost</p>
<p>is the reason why computers
are so fast today.</p>
<p>The ability to sustain
10 times more computing</p>
<p>every five years without increase in power</p>
<p>is the reason why the world&rsquo;s data center</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t consumed so much
more power on Earth.</p>
<p>That trend has ended and we
need a new computing approach</p>
<p>and accelerated computing
is the path forward.</p>
<p>It happened at exactly the time</p>
<p>when a new way of doing
software was discovered,</p>
<p>deep learning,</p>
<p>these two events came together</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s driving computing today.</p>
<p>Accelerated computing and generative AI.</p>
<p>This way of doing software,</p>
<p>this way of doing computation</p>
<p>is a reinvention from the
ground up and it&rsquo;s not easy.</p>
<p>Accelerated computing
is a full stack problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as easy as
general purpose computing.</p>
<p>The CPU is a miracle.</p>
<p>High level programming
languages, great compilers,</p>
<p>almost anybody could write
reasonably good programs,</p>
<p>because the CPU is so flexible.</p>
<p>However,</p>
<p>its ability to continue to
scale and performance has ended</p>
<p>and we need a new approach.</p>
<p>Accelerate computing is full stack.</p>
<p>You have to re-engineer
everything from the top down</p>
<p>and from the bottom up,</p>
<p>from the chip to the systems,</p>
<p>to the systems&rsquo; software,</p>
<p>new algorithms</p>
<p>and of course optimizing
the new, the applications.</p>
<p>The second is that it&rsquo;s a
data center scale problem.</p>
<p>And the reason why it&rsquo;s a
data center scale problem</p>
<p>is today the data center is the computer.</p>
<p>Unlike the past,</p>
<p>when your PC was a computer
or the phone was a computer,</p>
<p>today your data center is the computer.</p>
<p>The application runs across
the entire data center</p>
<p>and therefore it&rsquo;s vital
that you have to understand</p>
<p>how to optimize the chips, the compute,</p>
<p>the software across the NIC, the switch,</p>
<p>all the way to the other end
in a distributor computing way.</p>
<p>And the third accelerated
computing is multi-domain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s domain specific.</p>
<p>The algorithms and the
software stacks that you create</p>
<p>for computational biology</p>
<p>and the software stack you create</p>
<p>for computational fluid dynamics</p>
<p>are fundamentally different.</p>
<p>Each one of these domains of
science need their own stack,</p>
<p>which is the reason why
accelerated computing has taken us</p>
<p>nearly three decades to accomplish.</p>
<p>This entire stack has taken
us nearly three decades.</p>
<p>However, the performance is incredible,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll show you.</p>
<p>After three decades,</p>
<p>we realize now that we&rsquo;re
at the tipping point.</p>
<p>A new computing model is
extremely hard to come by.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is this.</p>
<p>In order for there to be
a new computing model,</p>
<p>you need developers.</p>
<p>But a developer would
only come if they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>and developers have to create applications</p>
<p>that end users would buy.</p>
<p>And without end users,
there would be no customers,</p>
<p>no computer companies to build computers,</p>
<p>without computer companies,</p>
<p>like yourself building computers,</p>
<p>there would be no install base.</p>
<p>Without install base, there
would be no developers.</p>
<p>Without developers,
there&rsquo;ll be no applications.</p>
<p>This loop,</p>
<p>this loop has been suffered</p>
<p>by so many computing
companies in the 40 years</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been in this industry,</p>
<p>this is really one of the
first major times in history</p>
<p>a new computing model has
been developed and created.</p>
<p>We now have 4 million developers,</p>
<p>3000 plus applications,</p>
<p>40 million CUDA downloads in history,</p>
<p>25 million just last year.</p>
<p>40 million downloaded in history,
25 million just last year.</p>
<p>15,000 startup companies in the
world built on Nvidia today,</p>
<p>building on Nvidia today,</p>
<p>and 40,000 large companies,
enterprises around the world,</p>
<p>are using accelerated computing.</p>
<p>We have now reached the tipping point</p>
<p>of a new computing era.</p>
<p>This new computing model
is now enjoyed and embraced</p>
<p>by just about every computer company</p>
<p>and every cloud company in the world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason for that.</p>
<p>It turns out that every
single computing approach</p>
<p>its benefit in the final
analysis is lower cost.</p>
<p>The PC revolution that started</p>
<p>and that Taiwan enjoyed in 1984,</p>
<p>starting in 1984, the year I graduated,</p>
<p>that decade in the eighties
was the PC revolution.</p>
<p>PC brought computing to a price point</p>
<p>nobody&rsquo;s ever seen before.</p>
<p>And then of course,</p>
<p>mobile devices was convenient</p>
<p>and it also saved
enormous amounts of money.</p>
<p>We aggregated and combined the camera,</p>
<p>the music player, your PC, a phone.</p>
<p>So many different devices
were all integrated into one.</p>
<p>And as a result,</p>
<p>not only are you able to
enjoy your life better,</p>
<p>it also saves a lot of
money and great convenience.</p>
<p>Every single generation</p>
<p>provided something new and saved money.</p>
<p>Well, this is how
accelerated computing works.</p>
<p>This is accelerated computing</p>
<p>used for large language models.</p>
<p>For large language models.</p>
<p>Basically the core of generative AI.</p>
<p>This is a 10, this example
is a $10 million server</p>
<p>and we costed everything.</p>
<p>We costed the process,
we costed all the chips,</p>
<p>we costed all the network, we
costed literally everything.</p>
<p>And so $10 million gets you
nearly a thousand CPU servers.</p>
<p>And to train to process
this large language model</p>
<p>takes 11 gigawatt hours.</p>
<p>11 gigawatt hours, okay?</p>
<p>And this is what happens
when you accelerate</p>
<p>this workload with accelerated computing.</p>
<p>And so with $10 million,
for a $10 million server,</p>
<p>you buy 48 GPU servers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the reason why people say</p>
<p>that GPU servers are so expensive.</p>
<p>Remember people say GPU
servers are so expensive.</p>
<p>However, the GPU server
is no longer the computer.</p>
<p>The computer is the data center.</p>
<p>Your goal is to build the most
cost effective data center,</p>
<p>not build the most cost effective server.</p>
<p>Back in the old days when
the computer was the server,</p>
<p>that would be a reasonable thing to do,</p>
<p>but today the computer is the data center.</p>
<p>And so what you want to do</p>
<p>is you want to create the
most effective data center</p>
<p>with the best TCO.</p>
<p>So for $10 million,</p>
<p>you buy 48 GPU servers.</p>
<p>It only consumes 3.2 gigawatt hours</p>
<p>and 44 times the performance.</p>
<p>Let me just show it to you one more time.</p>
<p>This is before and this is after.</p>
<p>And this is,</p>
<p>(audience laughs and applauds)</p>
<p>we want dense computers, not big ones.</p>
<p>We want dense computers,
fast computers, not big ones.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s ISO budget.</p>
<p>Let me show you something else.</p>
<p>Okay, so this is $10 million again,</p>
<p>960 CPU servers.</p>
<p>Now this time,</p>
<p>this time we&rsquo;re gonna be ISO power.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna keep this number the same.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna keep this
number the same, okay?</p>
<p>So this number is the same,</p>
<p>the same amount of power.</p>
<p>This means your data
center is power limited.</p>
<p>In fact, most data centers
today are power limited.</p>
<p>And so with being power limited
using accelerated computing,</p>
<p>you can get 150 times more performance</p>
<p>with three times more cost.</p>
<p>But why is that such a great deal?</p>
<p>The reason for that is because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very expensive and time consuming</p>
<p>to find another data center.</p>
<p>Almost everybody is power limited today.</p>
<p>Almost everybody is
scrambling to break new ground</p>
<p>to get more data centers.</p>
<p>And so if you are power limited</p>
<p>or if your customers are power limited,</p>
<p>then what they can do</p>
<p>is invest more into that data center,</p>
<p>which already, which has 11 gigawatts,</p>
<p>and you can get a lot more throughput,</p>
<p>continue to drive your growth.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another example.</p>
<p>This is my favorite.</p>
<p>If your goal, if your goal
is to get the work done,</p>
<p>if your goal is to get the work done,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t care how.</p>
<p>Your goal is to get the work
done, you don&rsquo;t care how.</p>
<p>And this is the work you want to get done.</p>
<p>ISO work, okay?</p>
<p>This is ISO work.</p>
<p>All right, look at this.</p>
<p>(audience laughs and applauds)</p>
<p>Oh, (speaks foreign language)</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<p>That was, people love that, right?</p>
<p>Nice to see you, Carol.</p>
<p>Nice to see you, Spencer.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s do that one more time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so, it&rsquo;s so delightful.</p>
<p>Look at this.</p>
<p>Oh, oh, oh, no, no.</p>
<p>Okay, look at this.</p>
<p>Look at this,</p>
<p>before,</p>
<p>after.</p>
<p>The more you buy, the more you save.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>The more you buy, the more you save,</p>
<p>(audience laughs and applauds)</p>
<p>the more you buy, the more you save.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Nvidia.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to understand the strategy,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to
understand the technology.</p>
<p>The more you buy, the more you save.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only thing
you have to understand.</p>
<p>Data center, data center.</p>
<p>Now, why is it?</p>
<p>You have been, you&rsquo;ve
heard me talk about this</p>
<p>for so many years.</p>
<p>In fact, every single time you saw me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking to you
about accelerated computing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking about
accelerated computing,</p>
<p>well, for a long time,</p>
<p>well over two decades.</p>
<p>And now why is it that finally
it&rsquo;s the tipping point?</p>
<p>Because the data center
equation is very complicated.</p>
<p>This equation is very complicated.</p>
<p>This is the cost of
building a data center.</p>
<p>The data center TCO is a function of,</p>
<p>and this is the part
where everybody mess up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a function of the chips,
of course, no question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a function of the systems,
of course, no question.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also because there&rsquo;s
so many different use cases.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a function of the
diversity of systems</p>
<p>that can be created.</p>
<p>It is the reason why
Taiwan is at the bedrock</p>
<p>at the foundation of
the computer industry.</p>
<p>Without Taiwan,</p>
<p>why would there be</p>
<p>so many different
configurations of computers?</p>
<p>Big, small, powerful, cheap,</p>
<p>enterprise, hyperscale, super computing,</p>
<p>so many different types of configurations,</p>
<p>1U, 2U, 4U, right?</p>
<p>And all completely compatible.</p>
<p>The ability for the
hardware ecosystem of Taiwan</p>
<p>to have created so many different versions</p>
<p>that are software compatible.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>The throughput of the computer
of course is very important.</p>
<p>It depends on the chip,</p>
<p>but it also depends as you know,</p>
<p>the algorithm.</p>
<p>Because without the algorithm libraries</p>
<p>accelerated computing does nothing.</p>
<p>It just sits there.</p>
<p>And so you need to algorithm
software libraries.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a data center scale problem.</p>
<p>So networking matters.</p>
<p>And networking matters,</p>
<p>distributed computing
is all about software.</p>
<p>Again, system software matters.</p>
<p>And before, before long,</p>
<p>in order for you to present
your system to your customers,</p>
<p>you have to ultimately
have a lot of applications</p>
<p>that run on top of it.</p>
<p>The software ecosystem matter.</p>
<p>Well, the utilization of a data center</p>
<p>is one of the most important
criteria of its TCO.</p>
<p>Just like a hotel.</p>
<p>If the hotel is wonderful,
but it&rsquo;s mostly empty,</p>
<p>the cost is incredible.</p>
<p>And so you need the
utilization to be high.</p>
<p>In order for the utilization to be high,</p>
<p>you have to have many different,</p>
<p>many different applications.</p>
<p>So the richness of the
applications matter.</p>
<p>Again, the algorithm in libraries</p>
<p>and now the software ecosystem.</p>
<p>You purchase a computer,</p>
<p>but these computers are
incredibly hard to deploy</p>
<p>from the moment that you buy the computer</p>
<p>to the time that you put
that computer to work</p>
<p>to start making money,</p>
<p>that difference can be weeks,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re very good at
it, incredibly good at it.</p>
<p>We can stand up a super computer</p>
<p>in a matter of a couple of weeks,</p>
<p>because we build so many
all around the world,</p>
<p>hundreds around the world.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re not very good
at it, it could take a year.</p>
<p>That difference,</p>
<p>depriving yourself the
year of making money</p>
<p>and the year of depreciation,</p>
<p>incredible cost.</p>
<p>Lifecycle optimization.</p>
<p>Because the data center
is software defined,</p>
<p>there are so many engineers
that will continue to refine</p>
<p>and continue to optimize
the software stack.</p>
<p>Because NVIDIA&rsquo;s software stack</p>
<p>is architecturally compatible
across all of our generations,</p>
<p>across all of our GPUs.</p>
<p>Every time we optimize
something, it benefits everybody.</p>
<p>Every time we optimize
something, it benefits everybody.</p>
<p>So lifecycle optimization,</p>
<p>and of course finally the
energy that you use, power.</p>
<p>But this equation is
incredibly complicated.</p>
<p>Well,</p>
<p>because we have now addressed</p>
<p>so many different domains of science,</p>
<p>so many industries,</p>
<p>and in data processing,</p>
<p>in deep learning,
classical machine learning,</p>
<p>so many different ways
for us to deploy software</p>
<p>from the cloud to enterprise
to supercomputing to the Edge,</p>
<p>so many different configurations of GPUs,</p>
<p>from our HGX versions to
our Omniverse versions,</p>
<p>to our cloud GPU and graphics version,</p>
<p>so many different versions.</p>
<p>Now, the utilization is incredibly high.</p>
<p>The utilization of Nvidia GPU is so high,</p>
<p>almost every single
cloud is over extended.</p>
<p>Almost every single data
center is over extended.</p>
<p>There are so many different
applications using it.</p>
<p>So we have now reached the tipping point</p>
<p>of accelerated computing.</p>
<p>We have now reached the
tipping point of generative AI.</p>
<p>And I want to thank all
of you for your support</p>
<p>and all of your assistance and partnership</p>
<p>in making this dream happen.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<p>Every single time we
announce the new product,</p>
<p>the demand for every single generation</p>
<p>increased and increased and increased.</p>
<p>And then one generation, it hockey steps,</p>
<p>we stick with it, we stick
with it, we stick with it,</p>
<p>Kepler,</p>
<p>and then Volta,</p>
<p>and then Pascal,</p>
<p>and then Volta,</p>
<p>and then Ampere.</p>
<p>And now this generation
of accelerated computing,</p>
<p>the demand is literally from
every corner of the world.</p>
<p>And we are so, so, so excited</p>
<p>to be in full volume
production of the H100.</p>
<p>And I wanna thank all
of you for your support.</p>
<p>This is incredible.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<p>H100 is in full production,</p>
<p>manufactured by companies all over Taiwan,</p>
<p>used in clouds everywhere,</p>
<p>enterprises everywhere.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s take a look at a short video</p>
<p>of how H100 is produced.</p>
<p>(machines whir)</p>
<p>(upbeat music plays)</p>
<p>(machines continue to whir)</p>
<p>(upbeat music continues)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>This computer,</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<p>35,000 components on that system board,</p>
<p>eight Hopper GPUs.</p>
<p>Let me show it to you.</p>
<p>Whoosh.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Audience Member] Yay.
(audience applauds and cheers)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All right, this,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I would lift this,</p>
<p>but I still have the rest of the keynote</p>
<p>I would like to give.</p>
<p>This is 60 pounds, 65 pounds.</p>
<p>It takes robots to lift it, of course,</p>
<p>and it takes robots to insert it,</p>
<p>because the insertion pressure is so high</p>
<p>and it has to be so perfect.</p>
<p>This computer is
$200,000, and as you know,</p>
<p>it replaces an entire
room of other computers.</p>
<p>So this, I know it&rsquo;s a very,
very expensive computer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s single
most expensive computer</p>
<p>that you can say, &ldquo;The more
you buy, the more you save.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>This is what a compute tray looks like.</p>
<p>Even this is incredibly heavy.</p>
<p>See that?</p>
<p>So this is the brand new H100</p>
<p>with the world&rsquo;s first computer</p>
<p>that has a transformer engine in it.</p>
<p>The performance is utterly incredible.</p>
<p>Hopper is in full production.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been driving computing,</p>
<p>this new form of computing for 12 years.</p>
<p>When we first met the
deep learning researchers,</p>
<p>we were fortunate to realize</p>
<p>that not only was deep
learning going to be</p>
<p>a fantastic algorithm for
many applications initially,</p>
<p>computer vision and speech,</p>
<p>but it would also be a whole
new way of doing software.</p>
<p>This fundamental new way of doing software</p>
<p>that can use data to develop,</p>
<p>to train a universal function approximator</p>
<p>of incredible dimensionality.</p>
<p>It can basically predict almost anything</p>
<p>that you have data for,</p>
<p>so long as the data has
structure that it can learn from.</p>
<p>And so we realized the importance of this</p>
<p>new method of developing software,</p>
<p>and then it has the potential</p>
<p>of completely reinventing computing.</p>
<p>And we were right.</p>
<p>12 years later,</p>
<p>we have reinvented literally everything.</p>
<p>We reinvented, of course,
we started by creating</p>
<p>a new type of library.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s essentially like a SQL,</p>
<p>except for deep learning for
neural network processing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a rendering engine,</p>
<p>a solver for neural network
processing called (indistinct).</p>
<p>We reinvented the GPU.</p>
<p>People thought that
GPUs would just be GPUs.</p>
<p>They were completely wrong.</p>
<p>We dedicated ourselves
to reinventing the GPUs,</p>
<p>so that it&rsquo;s incredibly
good at Tensor processing.</p>
<p>We created a new type
of packaging called SXM</p>
<p>and worked with TSMC on CoWos,</p>
<p>so that we could stack
multiple chips on the same dye.</p>
<p>NVLink, so that we can connect
these SXM modules together</p>
<p>with high speed chip to chip interconnect.</p>
<p>Almost a decade ago,</p>
<p>we built the world&rsquo;s first
chip to chip (indistinct),</p>
<p>so that we can expand
the memory size of GPUs</p>
<p>using SXMs and NVLink.</p>
<p>And we create a new type of motherboard,</p>
<p>we call it HGX that I just showed you.</p>
<p>No computers has ever
been this heavy before</p>
<p>or consumed this much current.</p>
<p>Every aspect of a data
center had to be reinvented.</p>
<p>We also invented a new
type of computer appliance</p>
<p>so that we could develop software on it</p>
<p>so that third party developers
could develop software on it</p>
<p>with a simple appliance we call DGX,</p>
<p>basically a giant GPU computer.</p>
<p>DGX.</p>
<p>We also purchased Mellanox,</p>
<p>which is one of the great
strategic decisions of our company</p>
<p>because we realized that in the future,</p>
<p>if the data center is the computer,</p>
<p>then the networking is the nervous system.</p>
<p>If the data center is the
configure, is the computer,</p>
<p>then the networking
defines the data center.</p>
<p>That was an incredibly good acquisition</p>
<p>and since then we&rsquo;ve done
so many things together</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna show you some</p>
<p>really, really amazing work today.</p>
<p>And then of course, an operating system.</p>
<p>If you have a nervous system,
a distributed computer,</p>
<p>it needs to have an operating system.</p>
<p>And the operating system of
this distributed computering</p>
<p>we call Magnum IO.</p>
<p>Some of our most important work.</p>
<p>And then all of the algorithms and engines</p>
<p>that sit on top of these
computers, we call Nvidia AI.</p>
<p>The only AI operating system in the world</p>
<p>that takes data processing
from data processing</p>
<p>to training, to optimization,
to deployment and inference.</p>
<p>End-to-end deep learning processing.</p>
<p>It is the engine of AI today.</p>
<p>Well, every single generation
since Kepler, which is K80,</p>
<p>to Pascal Volta, Ampere, Hopper,</p>
<p>every two years, every two years,</p>
<p>we took a giant leap forward.</p>
<p>But we realized we needed
more than even that,</p>
<p>and which is the reason
why we connected GPUs</p>
<p>to other GPUs called NVLink,</p>
<p>built one giant GPU,</p>
<p>and we connected those GPUs together</p>
<p>using InfiniBand into
larger scale computers.</p>
<p>That ability for us to drive the processor</p>
<p>and extend the scale of computing</p>
<p>made it possible for the
AI research organization,</p>
<p>the community,</p>
<p>to advance AI at an incredible rate.</p>
<p>We just kept pushing
and pushing and pushing.</p>
<p>Hopper went into production
August of last year.</p>
<p>August, 2022.</p>
<p>2024, which is next year,
we&rsquo;ll have Hopper-Next.</p>
<p>Last year we had Quantum.</p>
<p>Two years from now or next year,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll have Quantum-Next.</p>
<p>So every two years we
take giant leaps forward</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m expecting the next
leap to be giant as well.</p>
<p>This is the new computer industry.</p>
<p>Software is no longer programmed
just by computer engineers.</p>
<p>Software is programmed
by computer engineers</p>
<p>working with AI supercomputers.</p>
<p>These AI supercomputers
are a new type of factory.</p>
<p>It is very logical that a
car industry has factories.</p>
<p>They build things that you can see, cars.</p>
<p>It is very logical that computer industry</p>
<p>has computer factories.</p>
<p>You build things that
you can see, computers.</p>
<p>In the future,</p>
<p>every single major company</p>
<p>will also have AI factories</p>
<p>and you will build and produce
your company&rsquo;s intelligence.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very sensible thing.</p>
<p>We cultivate and develop
and nourish our employees</p>
<p>and continue to create the conditions</p>
<p>by which they can do their best work.</p>
<p>We are intelligence producers already.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the intelligence producers,</p>
<p>the intelligence are people.</p>
<p>In the future, we will be
intelligence producers,</p>
<p>artificial intelligence producers.</p>
<p>And every single company
will have factories</p>
<p>and the factories will be built this way.</p>
<p>This translates to your throughput.</p>
<p>This translates to your scale</p>
<p>and you will build it in a way
that is very, very good TCO.</p>
<p>Well, our dedication to pursuing this path</p>
<p>and relentlessly
increasing the performance.</p>
<p>just think in 10 years time,</p>
<p>we increased the throughput,</p>
<p>we increased the scale,</p>
<p>the overall throughput
across all of that stack</p>
<p>by 1 million x,</p>
<p>1 million x in 10 years.</p>
<p>Well just now, in the beginning,</p>
<p>I showed you computer graphics.</p>
<p>In five years,</p>
<p>we improved the computer
graphics by 1000 times.</p>
<p>In five years,</p>
<p>using artificial intelligence
and accelerated computing.</p>
<p>Using accelerated computing
and artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>we accelerated computer graphics</p>
<p>by 1000 times in five years.</p>
<p>Moore&rsquo;s law is probably</p>
<p>currently running at about two times.</p>
<p>A thousand times in five years.</p>
<p>A thousand times in five years</p>
<p>is 1 million times in 10.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing the same thing
in artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Now, question is,</p>
<p>what can you do when your computer</p>
<p>is 1 million times faster?</p>
<p>What would you do if your computer</p>
<p>was 1 million times faster?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that the friends we met</p>
<p>at University of Toronto,</p>
<p>Ilia Sutskever, Alex Krizhevsky,
and Geoffrey Hinton, they,</p>
<p>and Ilia Sutskever, of course,
was the founder of OpenAI,</p>
<p>and he discovered the continuous scaling</p>
<p>of artificial intelligence
and deep learning networks</p>
<p>and came up with the ChatGPT breakthrough.</p>
<p>Well,</p>
<p>in this general form,</p>
<p>this is what has happened.</p>
<p>The transformer engine,
the transformer engine,</p>
<p>and the ability to use
unsupervised learning,</p>
<p>unsupervised learning,</p>
<p>be able to learn from
a giant amount of data</p>
<p>and recognize patterns and relationships</p>
<p>across a large sequence.</p>
<p>And using transformers
to predict the next word,</p>
<p>large language models were created,</p>
<p>and the breakthrough, of course,
is very, very, very clear.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure that everybody here</p>
<p>has already tried ChatGPT.</p>
<p>But the important thing is this.</p>
<p>We now have a software capability</p>
<p>to learn the structure of
almost any information.</p>
<p>We can learn the structure
of text, sound, images,</p>
<p>there is structure in all of us,</p>
<p>physics,</p>
<p>proteins,</p>
<p>DNA,</p>
<p>chemicals,</p>
<p>anything that has structure,</p>
<p>we can learn that language,
learn its language.</p>
<p>Of course you can learn English
and Chinese and Japanese</p>
<p>and so on and so forth,</p>
<p>but you can also learn the
language of many other things.</p>
<p>And then the next breakthrough came,</p>
<p>generative AI.</p>
<p>Once you can learn the language,</p>
<p>once you can learn the language
of certain information,</p>
<p>then with control and guidance</p>
<p>from another source of information,</p>
<p>that we call prompts,</p>
<p>we can now guide the AI</p>
<p>to generate information of all kinds.</p>
<p>We can generate
text-to-text, text-to-image.</p>
<p>But the important thing is this,</p>
<p>information transformed
to other information</p>
<p>is now possible.</p>
<p>Text to proteins, text to chemicals,</p>
<p>images to 3D,</p>
<p>images to 2D,</p>
<p>images to text, captioning,</p>
<p>video to video.</p>
<p>So many different types of information</p>
<p>can now be transformed.</p>
<p>For the very first time in history</p>
<p>we have a software technology</p>
<p>that is able to understand</p>
<p>the representation of
information of many modalities.</p>
<p>We can now apply computer science,</p>
<p>we can now apply the
instrument of our industry.</p>
<p>We can now apply the
instrument of our industry</p>
<p>to so many different fields
that were impossible before.</p>
<p>This is the reason why
everybody is so excited.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s take a look at some of these.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at what it can do.</p>
<p>This, here&rsquo;s a prompt,
and this prompt says,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi Computex,&rdquo;</p>
<p>so this is a, we type in the word,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Computex, I&rsquo;m here to tell you</p>
<p>how wonderful stinky tofu is.</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>You can enjoy it right here in Taiwan.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s best from the night market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was just there the other night.</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>Okay, play it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi Computex, I&rsquo;m here to tell you about</li>
</ul>
<p>how wonderful stinky tofu is.</p>
<p>You can enjoy it right here in Taiwan.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s best from the night market.</p>
<ul>
<li>The only input was words.</li>
</ul>
<p>The output was that video.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<p>Okay, here&rsquo;s another prompt.</p>
<p>Taiwanese, we give, we tell this AI, okay?</p>
<p>We tell this AI, this is
a Google text-to-music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Traditional Taiwanese music.</p>
<p>Peaceful, like it&rsquo;s warm and raining</p>
<p>in a lush forest at daybreak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>(calm music plays)</p>
<p>(speaks foreign language)</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<p>We send texts in.</p>
<p>AI says, &ldquo;Hmm, okay, this music,&rdquo; okay?</p>
<p>Hear this one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am here at Computex,</p>
<p>I will make you like me best.</p>
<p>Sing sing it with me.</p>
<p>I really like Nvidia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>So this is the word,
these are the words are,</p>
<p>these are the words.</p>
<p>And I, &ldquo;Hey, hey, voice mod,
could you write me a song?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These are the words.</p>
<p>Okay, play it.</p>
<ul>
<li>(upbeat accompaniment
plays) ‚ô™ I am here at Computex</li>
</ul>
<p>‚ô™ I will make you like me best, yeah. ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Sing sing it with me ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ I really like Nvidia. ‚ô™</p>
<p>(audience cheers and applauds)</p>
<ul>
<li>Okay, so obviously</li>
</ul>
<p>this is a very, very
important new capability,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the reason why there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so many generative AI startups.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re working with some
1600 generative AI startups.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in all kinds of domain,</p>
<p>in language domains, in media, in biology.</p>
<p>This is one of the most important
areas that we care about.</p>
<p>Digital biology is going to
go through its revolution.</p>
<p>This is going to be an incredible thing.</p>
<p>Just as we had Synopsis and Cadence</p>
<p>help us create tools</p>
<p>so that we can build
wonderful chips and systems,</p>
<p>for the very first time,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have computer
aided drug discovery tools.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll be able to manipulate</p>
<p>and work with proteins and chemicals</p>
<p>and understands disease targets</p>
<p>and try all kinds of chemicals</p>
<p>that previously had never
been thought of before.</p>
<p>Okay, so really, really important area.</p>
<p>Lots of startups, tools
and platform companies.</p>
<p>And let me show you a video</p>
<p>of some of the work that they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Play it, please.</p>
<ul>
<li>Generative AI is the most important</li>
</ul>
<p>computing platform of our generation.</p>
<p>Everyone from first movers
to Fortune 500 companies</p>
<p>are creating new applications</p>
<p>to capitalize on generative AI&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to automate and co-create.</p>
<p>For creatives, there&rsquo;s
a brand new set of tools</p>
<p>that would be simply
impossible a few years ago.</p>
<p>Adobe is integrating Firefly
into their creative apps,</p>
<p>ethically trained and artist friendly.</p>
<p>You can now create images
with a simple text prompt.</p>
<p>Or expand the image of your real photos</p>
<p>to what lies beyond the lens.</p>
<p>Productivity apps will never be the same.</p>
<p>Microsoft has created a
co-pilot for office apps.</p>
<p>Every profession is about to change.</p>
<p>Tabnine is democratizing programming</p>
<p>by tapping into the knowledge base</p>
<p>of a million developers</p>
<p>to accelerate application development</p>
<p>and reduce debugging time.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re an architect</p>
<p>or just thinking of remodeling your home,</p>
<p>Planner 5D can instantly turn
a 2D floor plan to a 3D model.</p>
<p>And right here in Taiwan,</p>
<p>AnHorn medicines is targeting</p>
<p>difficult to treat diseases
and accelerating cures.</p>
<ul>
<li>Incredible, right?</li>
</ul>
<p>Just utterly incredible.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question that
we&rsquo;re in a new computing era.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just absolutely
no question about it.</p>
<p>Every single computing era,</p>
<p>you could do different things
that weren&rsquo;t possible before,</p>
<p>and artificial intelligence
certainly qualifies.</p>
<p>This particular computing era
is special in several ways.</p>
<p>One,</p>
<p>it is able to understand information</p>
<p>of more than just text and numbers.</p>
<p>It can now understand multimodality,</p>
<p>which is the reason why
this computing revolution</p>
<p>can impact every industry, every industry.</p>
<p>Two, because this computer
doesn&rsquo;t care how you program it.</p>
<p>It will try to understand what you mean,</p>
<p>because it has this incredible</p>
<p>large language model capability.</p>
<p>And so the programming
barrier is incredibly low.</p>
<p>We have closed the digital divide.</p>
<p>Everyone is a programmer now.</p>
<p>You just have to say
something to the computer.</p>
<p>Third,</p>
<p>this computer,</p>
<p>not only is it able to do
amazing things for the future,</p>
<p>it can do amazing things
for every single application</p>
<p>of the previous era,</p>
<p>which is the reason why all of these APIs</p>
<p>are being connected into
Windows applications</p>
<p>here and there, and browsers
and PowerPoint and Word.</p>
<p>Every application that exists
will be better because of AI.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to just AI this generation,</p>
<p>this computing era does
not need new applications.</p>
<p>It can succeed with old applications</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna have new applications.</p>
<p>The rate of progress,
the rate of progress,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so easy to use,</p>
<p>is the reason why it&rsquo;s growing so fast.</p>
<p>This is going to touch
literally every single industry.</p>
<p>And at the core with,</p>
<p>just as with every single computing era,</p>
<p>it needs a new computing approach.</p>
<p>In this particular era,</p>
<p>the computing approach
is accelerated computing,</p>
<p>and it has been completely
reinvented from the ground up.</p>
<p>Last several years,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking to you about</p>
<p>the new type of processor
we&rsquo;ve been creating,</p>
<p>and this is the reason
we&rsquo;ve been creating it.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p>Grace Hopper is now in full production.</p>
<p>This is Grace Hopper.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<p>Nearly 200 billion
transistors in this computer.</p>
<p>Oh, (speaks foreign language),</p>
<p>(speaks foreign language),</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>look at this.</p>
<p>This is Grace Hopper.</p>
<p>This processor,</p>
<p>this processor is really quite amazing.</p>
<p>There are several
characteristics about it.</p>
<p>This is the world&rsquo;s first
accelerated processor,</p>
<p>accelerated computing processor</p>
<p>that also has a giant memory.</p>
<p>It has almost 600 gigabytes of memory</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coherent between
the CPU and the GPU.</p>
<p>And so the GPU can reference the memory,</p>
<p>the CPU can reference the memory,</p>
<p>and unnecessary, any unnecessary
copying back and forth</p>
<p>could be avoided.</p>
<p>The amazing amount of high speed memory</p>
<p>lets the GPU work on very,
very large data sets.</p>
<p>This is a computer, this is not a chip.</p>
<p>Practically, the entire
computer&rsquo;s on here.</p>
<p>All of the low, this is
uses low power DDR memory,</p>
<p>just like your cell phone,</p>
<p>except this has been
optimized and designed</p>
<p>for high resilience data
center applications.</p>
<p>Incredible levels of performance.</p>
<p>This took us several years to build,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m so excited about it</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll show you some of the things</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna do with it.</p>
<p>Janine, thank you,
(speaks foreign language).</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re supposed to say
(speaks foreign language).</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>(speaks foreign language)</p>
<p>Okay, so four PetaFLOPS,</p>
<p>transformer engine,</p>
<p>72 CPU cores,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re connected together.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re connected together by
a high speed chip to chip link</p>
<p>900 gigabytes per second.</p>
<p>And so the local memory,
96 gigabytes of HBM3 memory</p>
<p>is augmented by LPDDR memory.</p>
<p>Across this link,</p>
<p>across very, very large
and high speed cache.</p>
<p>So this computer is like none
other the world&rsquo;s ever seen.</p>
<p>Now, let me show you
some of its performance.</p>
<p>So the, I&rsquo;m comparing here on
three different applications,</p>
<p>and this is a very important application.</p>
<p>If you have never heard of it,</p>
<p>be sure to look into it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Vector database.</p>
<p>Vector database is a
database that has tokenized,</p>
<p>that has vectorized the data
that you&rsquo;re trying to store.</p>
<p>And so it understands the relationships</p>
<p>of all of the data inside its storage.</p>
<p>This is incredibly important</p>
<p>for knowledge augmentation
of the large language models</p>
<p>to avoid hallucination.</p>
<p>The second is deep learning
recommender systems.</p>
<p>This is how we get news and music</p>
<p>and all the texts that
you see on your devices.</p>
<p>Recommend of course, music and goods</p>
<p>and all kinds of things.</p>
<p>Recommender system is the
engine of the digital economy.</p>
<p>This is probably the single
most valuable piece of software</p>
<p>that any of the companies
in the world runs.</p>
<p>This is the world&rsquo;s first AI factory.</p>
<p>There will be other AI
factories in the future,</p>
<p>but this is really the first one.</p>
<p>And the last one is large
language model inference.</p>
<p>65 gigabytes.</p>
<p>65 gigabytes is a fair,</p>
<p>65 billion parameters is a
fairly large language model,</p>
<p>and you can see that on a
CPU it&rsquo;s just not possible.</p>
<p>The CPU is simply not possible.</p>
<p>With Grace Hopper, excuse me,</p>
<p>with Hopper on an x86,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s faster, but notice
it&rsquo;s memory limited.</p>
<p>You could of course
take this 400 gigabytes</p>
<p>and cut it up into a whole
bunch of small pieces,</p>
<p>shard it and distribute
it across more GPUs</p>
<p>and distribute it across more GPUs.</p>
<p>But in the case of Grace Hopper,</p>
<p>in the case of Grace Hopper,</p>
<p>Janine, (speaks foreign language).</p>
<p>Oh, Janine doesn&rsquo;t speak Chinese.</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>(speaks foreign language).</p>
<p>Okay,</p>
<p>Grace Hopper, Grace
Hopper has more memory,</p>
<p>has more memory on this one
module than all of these.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>And so as a result,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to break the
data into so many pieces.</p>
<p>Of course, the amount of
computation of this is higher,</p>
<p>but this is so much easier to use.</p>
<p>And if you want to scale
out large language models,</p>
<p>if you wanna scale out vector databases,</p>
<p>if you want to scale out deep
learning recommender systems,</p>
<p>this is the way to do it.</p>
<p>This is so easy to use.</p>
<p>Plug this into your data center
and you can scale out AI.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>So this is the reason why
we built Grace Hopper.</p>
<p>The other application that
I&rsquo;m super excited about</p>
<p>is the foundation of our own company.</p>
<p>Nvidia is a big customer of Cadence.</p>
<p>We use all of their tools.</p>
<p>And all of their tools run on CPUs.</p>
<p>And the reason why they run on CPUs</p>
<p>is because NVIDIA&rsquo;s
data sets are very large</p>
<p>and the algorithms are refined</p>
<p>over very long periods of time.</p>
<p>And so most of the algorithms
are very CPU centric.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been accelerating
some of these algorithms</p>
<p>with Cadence for some time,</p>
<p>but now with Grace Hopper,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve only been working on it</p>
<p>for a couple of days and weeks,</p>
<p>the performance speed up,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to show it to you, is insane.</p>
<p>This is going to revolutionize
an entire industry,</p>
<p>one of the highest</p>
<p>compute intensive industries
in the world, of course,</p>
<p>designing chips, designing
electronic systems,</p>
<p>CAE,</p>
<p>CAD,</p>
<p>EDA,</p>
<p>and of course, digital biology.</p>
<p>All of these markets,</p>
<p>all of these industries</p>
<p>require very large amounts of computation.</p>
<p>But the data set is also very large.</p>
<p>Ideal for Grace Hopper.</p>
<p>Well, 600 gigabytes is a lot.</p>
<p>600 gigabytes is a lot.</p>
<p>This is basically a supercomputer
I&rsquo;m holding in my hands.</p>
<p>This 600 gigabytes is a lot.</p>
<p>But when you think about it,</p>
<p>when we went from AlexNet</p>
<p>of 62 million parameters 12 years ago</p>
<p>and trained on 1.2 million images,</p>
<p>it is now 5,000 times
bigger with Google&rsquo;s Palm,</p>
<p>5,000 times bigger with
340 billion parameters.</p>
<p>And of course, we&rsquo;re gonna make
even bigger ones than that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been trained on
3 million times more data.</p>
<p>So literally in the course of 10 years,</p>
<p>the computing problem of deep learning</p>
<p>increased by 5,000 times for the software</p>
<p>and 3 million times for the dataset.</p>
<p>No other area of computing
has ever increased this fast.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve been chasing</p>
<p>the deep learning advance</p>
<p>for quite some time.</p>
<p>This is going to make a
big, big contribution.</p>
<p>However, 600 gigabytes
is still not enough.</p>
<p>We need a lot more.</p>
<p>So let me show you what we&rsquo;re gonna do.</p>
<p>So the first thing is, of course,</p>
<p>we have the Grace Hopper Super chip,</p>
<p>put that into a computer.</p>
<p>The second thing that we&rsquo;re gonna do</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re gonna connect
eight of these together</p>
<p>using NVLink.</p>
<p>This is an NVLink switch.</p>
<p>So eight of this, eight of this,</p>
<p>connect into three switch trays</p>
<p>into eight, eight Grace Hopper pod.</p>
<p>These eight Grace Hopper pods,</p>
<p>each one of the Grace Hoppers</p>
<p>are connected to the other Grace Hopper</p>
<p>at 900 gigabytes per second.</p>
<p>600 gigabytes, 900 megabytes per second.</p>
<p>Eight of them connected together as a pod,</p>
<p>and then we connect 32 of them together</p>
<p>with another layer of switches.</p>
<p>And in order to build,</p>
<p>in order to build this,</p>
<p>256 Grace Hopper super chips connected</p>
<p>into one exaFLOPS,</p>
<p>one exaFLOPS.</p>
<p>You know that countries and nations</p>
<p>have been working on exaFLOPS computing</p>
<p>and just recently achieved it.</p>
<p>256 Grace Hoppers for deep learning</p>
<p>is one exaFLOPS transformer engine.</p>
<p>And it gives us 144 terabytes of memory</p>
<p>that every GPU can see.</p>
<p>This is not 144 terabytes distributed.</p>
<p>This is 144 terabytes connected.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we take a look at
what it really looks like?</p>
<p>Play it, please.</p>
<p>(machine whirs)</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<p>This is 150 miles of cables,</p>
<p>fiber optic cables,</p>
<p>2000 fans,</p>
<p>70,000 cubic feet per minute.</p>
<p>It probably recycles the
air in this entire room</p>
<p>in a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>40,000 pounds.</p>
<p>Four elephants.</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>One GPU.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<p>if I can get up on here.</p>
<p>This is actual size.</p>
<p>I wonder if this can play crisis.</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>Only gamers know that joke.</p>
<p>So this is our brand new Grace Hopper</p>
<p>AI super computer.</p>
<p>It is one giant GPU.</p>
<p>Utterly incredible.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re building it now.</p>
<p>All of the, every
component is in production</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re so excited that
Google Cloud, Meta and Microsoft</p>
<p>will be the first companies
in the world to have access,</p>
<p>and they will be doing
exploratory research</p>
<p>on the pioneering front,</p>
<p>the boundaries of artificial
intelligence with us.</p>
<p>We will, of course, build
these systems as products.</p>
<p>And so if you would like to
have an AI supercomputer,</p>
<p>we would of course, come and
install it in your company.</p>
<p>We also share the blueprints
of this supercomputer</p>
<p>with all of our cloud suppliers,</p>
<p>so that our cloud partners,</p>
<p>so that they can integrate
it into their networks</p>
<p>and into their infrastructure.</p>
<p>And we will also build
it inside our company</p>
<p>for us to do research
ourselves and do development.</p>
<p>So this is the DGX GH200.</p>
<p>It is one giant GPU.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<p>1964,</p>
<p>the year after I was born,</p>
<p>was a very good year for technology.</p>
<p>IBM, of course, launched the System/360</p>
<p>and AT&amp;T demonstrated to the world</p>
<p>their first picture phone.</p>
<p>Encoded, compressed,</p>
<p>streamed over copper telephone wires and,</p>
<p>twisted pair, and on
the other end decoded,</p>
<p>picture phone, little tiny
screen black and white.</p>
<p>To this day, this very
experience is largely the same,</p>
<p>of course, at much, much higher volumes</p>
<p>for all of the reasons we all know well.</p>
<p>Video calls is now one of the
most important things we do.</p>
<p>Everybody does it.</p>
<p>About 65% of the Internet&rsquo;s
traffic is now video,</p>
<p>and yet the way it&rsquo;s done is
fundamentally still the same.</p>
<p>Compress it on the device, stream it,</p>
<p>and decompress it on the other end.</p>
<p>Nothing changed in 60 years.</p>
<p>We treat communications like
it goes down a dump pipe.</p>
<p>The question is,</p>
<p>what would happen if we
applied generative AI to that?</p>
<p>We have now created a computer,</p>
<p>I showed you, Grace Hopper.</p>
<p>It can be deployed broadly
all over the world, easily.</p>
<p>And as a result, every data
the center, every server</p>
<p>will have generative AI capability.</p>
<p>What would happen if
instead of decompression,</p>
<p>streaming and re, you know, recovering,</p>
<p>decompression, compression/decompression,</p>
<p>what if, the cloud performed
generative AI capability to it?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look.</p>
<p>(upbeat music plays)</p>
<ul>
<li>[Voice Off-Screen]
The future of wireless</li>
</ul>
<p>and video communications
will be 3D, generated by AI.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at how Nvidia Maxine 3D</p>
<p>running on the Nvidia
Grace Hopper super chip</p>
<p>can enable 3D video
conferencing on any device</p>
<p>without specialized software or hardware.</p>
<p>Starting with a standard 2D camera sensor</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in most cell phones,
laptops, and webcams,</p>
<p>and tapping into the processing
power of Grace Hopper.</p>
<p>Maxine 3D converts these 2D videos to 3D</p>
<p>using cloud services.</p>
<p>This brings a new dimension
to video conferencing.</p>
<p>With Maxine 3D visualization,</p>
<p>creating an enhanced sense
of depth and presence,</p>
<p>you can dynamically adjust the camera</p>
<p>to see every angle, emotion,</p>
<p>engage with others more directly
with enhanced eye contact</p>
<p>and personalize your experience
with animated avatars.</p>
<p>Stylizing them with simple text prompts.</p>
<p>With Maxine&rsquo;s language capabilities,</p>
<p>your avatar can speak in other languages,</p>
<p>even ones you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nvidia (speaks foreign language).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nvidia (speaks foreign language)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Voice Off-Screen] Nvidia Maxine 3D,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>together with Grace Hopper,</p>
<p>bring immersive 3D video conferencing</p>
<p>to anyone with a mobile device,</p>
<p>revolutionizing the way we connect,</p>
<p>communicate, and collaborate.</p>
<ul>
<li>(speaks foreign language).</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, so all of the words,</p>
<p>all of the words coming
out of my mouth, of course,</p>
<p>was generated by AI.</p>
<p>So instead of compression
stream and decompression</p>
<p>in the future,</p>
<p>communications will be perceive, stream</p>
<p>and reconstruction, regeneration.</p>
<p>And it can be generated in
all kinds of different ways.</p>
<p>It can be generated in 3D, of course,</p>
<p>it can regenerate your
language in another language.</p>
<p>So we now have a universal translator.</p>
<p>This computing technology
could be, of course,</p>
<p>placed into every single cloud.</p>
<p>But the thing that&rsquo;s really amazing,</p>
<p>Grace Hopper is so fast, it
can even run the 5G stack.</p>
<p>A state-of-the-art 5G stack</p>
<p>could just run in software in
Grace Hopper, completely free.</p>
<p>Completely free.</p>
<p>All of a sudden a 5G
radio runs in software,</p>
<p>just like a video code deck
used to run in software.</p>
<p>Now you can run a 5G stack in software.</p>
<p>Of course, the layer one, PHY layer,</p>
<p>the layer two, MAC layer,</p>
<p>and the 5G core,</p>
<p>all of that computation
is quite intensive,</p>
<p>and it has to be timing precise,</p>
<p>which is the reason why we have</p>
<p>a BlueField-3 in the computer.</p>
<p>So that kind of time,
precision timing, networking,</p>
<p>but the entire stack can
now run in a Grace Hopper.</p>
<p>Basically what&rsquo;s happening here,</p>
<p>this computer that you&rsquo;re seeing here</p>
<p>allows us to bring generative AI</p>
<p>into every single data
center in the world today,</p>
<p>because we have software defined 5G,</p>
<p>then the telecommunication network</p>
<p>can also become a computing platform,</p>
<p>like the cloud data centers.</p>
<p>Every single data center in the
future could be intelligent.</p>
<p>Every data center could
be software defined.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s internet
based, networking based,</p>
<p>or 5G communications based.</p>
<p>Everything will be software defined.</p>
<p>This is really a great opportunity</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re announcing a
partnership with SoftBank</p>
<p>to partner, to re-architect
and implement generative AI</p>
<p>and software defined 5G
stack into the network</p>
<p>of SoftBank data centers around the world.</p>
<p>Really excited about this collaboration.</p>
<p>I just talked about how we are going to</p>
<p>extend the frontier of AI.</p>
<p>I talked about how we&rsquo;re
gonna scale out generative AI,</p>
<p>to scale out generative AI,</p>
<p>to advance generative AI,</p>
<p>but the number of computers in the world</p>
<p>is really quite magnificent.</p>
<p>Data centers all over the world.</p>
<p>And all of them over the next decade</p>
<p>will be recycled and re-engineered into</p>
<p>accelerated data centers</p>
<p>and generative AI capable data centers.</p>
<p>But there are so many
different applications</p>
<p>in so many different areas.</p>
<p>Scientific computing, data processing,</p>
<p>large language model
training that you&rsquo;ve been,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking about
generative AI inference,</p>
<p>that we just talked about,</p>
<p>cloud and video and graphics,</p>
<p>EDA, SDA, which as we just mentioned,</p>
<p>generative AI for enterprise.</p>
<p>And of course the Edge.</p>
<p>Each one of these applications</p>
<p>have different configurations of servers,</p>
<p>different focus of applications,</p>
<p>different deployment methods.</p>
<p>And so security is different.</p>
<p>Operating system is different.</p>
<p>How it&rsquo;s managed is different.</p>
<p>Where the computers are will be different.</p>
<p>And so each one of these
diverse application spaces</p>
<p>will have to be re-engineered
with a new type of computer.</p>
<p>Well, this is just an enormous
number of configurations.</p>
<p>And so today we&rsquo;re announcing,</p>
<p>in partnership with so many
companies here in Taiwan,</p>
<p>the Nvidia MGX,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an open modular
server design specification</p>
<p>and the design for accelerated computing.</p>
<p>Most of the servers today are designed</p>
<p>for general purpose of computing.</p>
<p>The mechanical, thermal and electrical</p>
<p>is insufficient for a very
highly dense computing system.</p>
<p>Accelerated computers take,
as you know, many servers</p>
<p>and compress it into one.</p>
<p>You save a lot of money,</p>
<p>you save a lot of floor space,</p>
<p>but the architecture is different.</p>
<p>And we designed it so that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>multi-generation standardized,</p>
<p>so that once you make an investment,</p>
<p>our next generation GPUs
and next generation CPUs</p>
<p>and next generation DPUs</p>
<p>will continue to easily configure into it</p>
<p>so that we can have best time-to-market</p>
<p>and best preservation of our investment.</p>
<p>We could, configurable into
hundreds of configurations</p>
<p>for different diversities</p>
<p>and different diverse applications</p>
<p>and integrate into cloud
or enterprise data center.</p>
<p>So you could have either
busbar or power regulators.</p>
<p>You could have cabling in the hot aisle</p>
<p>or cabling in the cold aisle.</p>
<p>Different data centers have
different requirements,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve made this modular and flexible</p>
<p>so that it could address all
of these different domains.</p>
<p>Now, this is the basic chassis.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at
some of the other things</p>
<p>you could do with it.</p>
<p>This is the Omniverse OVX server.</p>
<p>It has x86, 4 L40s, BlueField-3,</p>
<p>two CX7, six PCI express slots.</p>
<p>This is the Grace Omniverse server.</p>
<p>Grace, same four L40s, BF-3,
BlueField-3 and two CX7s, okay?</p>
<p>This is the Grace cloud graphics server.</p>
<p>This is the Hopper NVLink
generative AI inference server.</p>
<p>And we need sound effects like,</p>
<p>(makes swooshing sounds)</p>
<p>like that.</p>
<p>And then Grace Hopper 5G aerial server,</p>
<p>okay, for telecommunications?</p>
<p>Software defined telco.</p>
<p>Grace Hopper, 5G, aerial server, short,</p>
<p>and of course, Grace
Hopper liquid cooled, okay?</p>
<p>For very dense servers.</p>
<p>And then this one is our
dense general purpose</p>
<p>Grace super chip server.</p>
<p>This is just CPU.</p>
<p>And has the ability to
accommodate four Grace CPUs</p>
<p>or two Grace super chips,</p>
<p>enormous amounts of performance.</p>
<p>And if you are, if your data
center is power limited,</p>
<p>this CPU has incredible capabilities.</p>
<p>In a power limited
environment running PageRank,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s all kinds of
benchmarks you can run,</p>
<p>but we ran PageRank,</p>
<p>in ISO performance, in ISO
performance Grace only consumes</p>
<p>580 watts for the whole server.</p>
<p>Versus the latest generation
CPU servers, x86 servers,</p>
<p>1090 watts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically half the power
at the same performance.</p>
<p>Or another way of saying, you know,</p>
<p>at the same power, if your data
center is power constrained,</p>
<p>you get twice the performance.</p>
<p>Most data centers today are power limited,</p>
<p>and so this is really
a terrific capability.</p>
<p>There are all kinds of different servers</p>
<p>that are being made here in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Let me show you one of them.</p>
<p>Get my exercise in today.</p>
<p>Whoosh.</p>
<p>I am the sound effect.</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>Okay, you&rsquo;ve got BlueField-3, got the CX7,</p>
<p>you got the Grace Hopper.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many systems.</p>
<p>Let me show you some of them.</p>
<p>All of our partners, I&rsquo;m so grateful,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re working on Grace, Grace Hopper,</p>
<p>Hopper, L40s, L4s, BlueField-3s.</p>
<p>Just about every single
processor that we&rsquo;re building</p>
<p>are configured into these
servers of all different types.</p>
<p>And so this is Supermicro,
this is Gigabyte.</p>
<p>Tens,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like 70 different
server configurations.</p>
<p>This is Ingrasys,</p>
<p>this is ASRock,</p>
<p>Tyan,</p>
<p>Wistron,</p>
<p>Inventec.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just beautiful servers.</p>
<p>Pegatron.</p>
<p>We love servers, I love
servers, they&rsquo;re beautiful.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re beautiful to me.</p>
<p>QCT,</p>
<p>Asus,</p>
<p>Wiwynn,</p>
<p>ZT Systems.</p>
<p>And this ZT System,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re looking at
here is one of the pods</p>
<p>of our Grace Hopper AI supercomputer.</p>
<p>So I want to thank all of you.</p>
<p>I want to thank all of you
for your great support.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna expand AI
into a new territory.</p>
<p>If you look at the world&rsquo;s data centers,</p>
<p>the data center is now the computer</p>
<p>and the network defines
what that data center does.</p>
<p>Largely there are two types
of data centers today.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the data center
that&rsquo;s used for hyperscale,</p>
<p>where you have application
workloads of all different kinds.</p>
<p>The number of CPUs you,</p>
<p>the number of GPUs you connect to it,</p>
<p>is relatively low.</p>
<p>The number of tenants is very high.</p>
<p>The workload very, is heterogeneous.</p>
<p>The workloads are loosely coupled,</p>
<p>and you have another type of data center.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like supercomputing data centers,</p>
<p>AI supercomputers,</p>
<p>where the workloads are tightly coupled.</p>
<p>The number of tenants far fewer,</p>
<p>and sometimes just one.</p>
<p>Its purpose is high throughput</p>
<p>on very large computing problems.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s basically a standalone,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically a standalone.</p>
<p>And so supercomputing
centers and AI supercomputers</p>
<p>and the world&rsquo;s cloud, hyperscale cloud,</p>
<p>are very different in nature.</p>
<p>Ethernet is based on TCP,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lossy algorithm
and it&rsquo;s very resilient.</p>
<p>And whenever there&rsquo;s a loss,
packet loss, it retransmits.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s error correction that&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>It knows which one of the packets are lost</p>
<p>and requests the sender to retransmit it.</p>
<p>The ability for ethernet to interconnect</p>
<p>components of almost from anywhere</p>
<p>is the reason why the
world&rsquo;s internet was created.</p>
<p>If it required too much coordination,</p>
<p>how could we have built today&rsquo;s internet?</p>
<p>So Ethernet&rsquo;s profound contribution,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s this lossy capability,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s resilient capability.</p>
<p>And because so,</p>
<p>it basically can connect
almost anything together.</p>
<p>However, a supercomputing
data center can&rsquo;t afford that.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t interconnect
random things together</p>
<p>because that billion dollar supercomputer,</p>
<p>the difference between 95%</p>
<p>networking throughput achieved</p>
<p>versus 50% is effectively $500 million.</p>
<p>So the cost of that one workload</p>
<p>running across the entire supercomputer</p>
<p>is so expensive that you can&rsquo;t afford</p>
<p>to lose anything in the network.</p>
<p>InfiniBand is our, relies
on RDMA very heavily.</p>
<p>It is a flow control.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a loss-less approach.</p>
<p>It requires flow control,</p>
<p>which basically means</p>
<p>you have to understand the data center</p>
<p>from end to end,</p>
<p>the switch to the NIC, to the software.</p>
<p>So that you can orchestrate the traffic</p>
<p>with adaptive routing,</p>
<p>so that you could deal
with congestion control</p>
<p>and avoid the oversaturation of traffic</p>
<p>in an isolated area, which
result in packet loss.</p>
<p>You simply can&rsquo;t afford that,</p>
<p>because in the case of
InfiniBand, it&rsquo;s loss-less.</p>
<p>And so one is lossy, the
other one&rsquo;s lost-less.</p>
<p>Very resilient, very performant.</p>
<p>These two data centers
have lived separate lives.</p>
<p>These two data centers
have lived separate lives,</p>
<p>but now we would like
to bring generative AI</p>
<p>to every data center.</p>
<p>The question is how.</p>
<p>The question is how do we introduce</p>
<p>a new type of ethernet that&rsquo;s, of course,</p>
<p>backwards compatible with everything,</p>
<p>but is engineered in a way</p>
<p>that achieves the type of capabilities</p>
<p>that we can bring AI workloads</p>
<p>to the world&rsquo;s, any data center.</p>
<p>This is a really exciting journey</p>
<p>and at the core of this strategy</p>
<p>is a brand new switch that we&rsquo;ve made.</p>
<p>This is the Spectrum-4 switch.</p>
<p>And this switch,</p>
<p>Everything I&rsquo;m showing
today are very heavy.</p>
<p>Whoosh, like that.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<p>This is the Spectrum-4 switch,</p>
<p>128 ports of 400 gigabits per second.</p>
<p>128 ports of 400 gigabits per second,</p>
<p>51.2 terabytes per second.</p>
<p>This is the chip.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gigantic.</p>
<p>100 billion transistors,</p>
<p>90 millimeters by 90 millimeters,</p>
<p>800 balls on the bottom.</p>
<p>This is a 500 watt chip.</p>
<p>This switch is 2,800 watts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s air cooled.</p>
<p>There are 48 PCBs that
connect the switch together.</p>
<p>48 PCBs that build up the switch.</p>
<p>And the switch is designed,</p>
<p>the switch is designed
to, wait (indistinct), oh,</p>
<p>this switch is designed to
enable a new type of ethernet.</p>
<p>Remember what I said,</p>
<p>InfiniBand is fundamentally different</p>
<p>in the sense that we build
InfiniBand from end to end,</p>
<p>so that we could do adaptive routing,</p>
<p>so that we could do congestion control,</p>
<p>so that we can isolate performance,</p>
<p>so we could keep noisy neighbors apart,</p>
<p>so that we could do in fabric computing.</p>
<p>All of these capabilities
are simply not possible</p>
<p>in a loss-less approach of the internet</p>
<p>and of course of ethernet.</p>
<p>And so the way that we do Infinity Band</p>
<p>is designed from end-to-end.</p>
<p>Just the way supercomputers are built,</p>
<p>this is the way AI
supercomputers are built.</p>
<p>And we are gonna do the same thing now,</p>
<p>for the very first time for ethernet,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been waiting for the critical part.</p>
<p>And the critical part is
the Spectrum-4 switch.</p>
<p>The entire system consists
of several things.</p>
<p>So our new ethernet system for AI,</p>
<p>(speaks foreign language),</p>
<p>is this,</p>
<p>the Spectrum-4 switch</p>
<p>and the BlueField-3 SmartNIC or DPU.</p>
<p>This BlueField-3 is 400
gigabits per second NIC,</p>
<p>it connects directly to
the Spectrum-4 switch</p>
<p>in combination of four things,</p>
<p>The switch, the BlueField-3,</p>
<p>the cables that connect them together,</p>
<p>which are super important,</p>
<p>and the software that runs it all together</p>
<p>represents the Spectrum-4.</p>
<p>This is what it takes to build
a high performance network.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re gonna take this
capability to the world&rsquo;s CSPs.</p>
<p>The reception has been incredible,</p>
<p>and the reason for that is, of course,</p>
<p>every CSP, every data
center would like to turn</p>
<p>every single data center into
a generative AI data center.</p>
<p>There are some people that need,</p>
<p>they deployed ethernet
throughout their company</p>
<p>and they have a lot of
users for that data center.</p>
<p>The ability to have the
capabilities of InfiniBand</p>
<p>and isolating it within their data center</p>
<p>is very difficult to do.</p>
<p>And so for the very first time,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re bringing the capabilities</p>
<p>of high performance computing
into the ethernet market.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re gonna bring to the
ethernet market several things.</p>
<p>First, adaptive routing.</p>
<p>Adaptive routing basically says,</p>
<p>based on the traffic that is
going through your data center,</p>
<p>depending on which one of the ports</p>
<p>of that switch is overcongested,</p>
<p>it will tell BlueField-3 to send,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll send it to another port,</p>
<p>BlueField-3 on the other
end would reassemble it</p>
<p>and present the data to the CPU,</p>
<p>present the data to the
computer, to the GPU,</p>
<p>without any CPU intervention.</p>
<p>All completely in RDMA.</p>
<p>Number one, adaptive routing.</p>
<p>Second, congestion control.</p>
<p>Congestion control, it is possible,</p>
<p>it is possible for certain different ports</p>
<p>to become heavily congested,</p>
<p>in which case the telemetry of the switch,</p>
<p>each switch will see how
the network is performing</p>
<p>and communicate to the senders,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t send any
more data right away,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re congesting the network.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That congestion control requires</p>
<p>basically a overriding system,</p>
<p>which includes software to switch,</p>
<p>working with all of the endpoints</p>
<p>to overall manage the congestion</p>
<p>or the traffic and the
throughput of the data center.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s really important to realize</p>
<p>that in a high performance
computing application,</p>
<p>every single GPU must finish their job,</p>
<p>so that the application can move on.</p>
<p>In many cases where you do all reductions,</p>
<p>you have to wait until the
results of every single one.</p>
<p>So if one node takes too long,</p>
<p>everybody gets held back,</p>
<p>this capability is going to increase</p>
<p>Ethernet&rsquo;s overall
performance dramatically.</p>
<p>So Spectrum-X, really
excited to roll this out.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s applications,</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s enterprise has
yet to enjoy generative AI.</p>
<p>So far we&rsquo;ve been working with CSPs.</p>
<p>And the CSPs, of course,</p>
<p>is going to be able to bring generative AI</p>
<p>to many different regions</p>
<p>and many different
applications and industries.</p>
<p>The big journey is still ahead of us.</p>
<p>There are so many
enterprises in the world,</p>
<p>and everybody, because of
the multi-modality capability</p>
<p>that I was mentioning before,</p>
<p>every industry can now
benefit from generative AI.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s several things that we have to do.</p>
<p>Number one,</p>
<p>we have to help the industries
build custom language models.</p>
<p>Not everybody can use the language models</p>
<p>that are available in a public service.</p>
<p>Some customers need language models</p>
<p>that are highly specialized
for their particular modality.</p>
<p>For example, proteins or chemicals.</p>
<p>Each one of these industries
have proprietary information,</p>
<p>and so how can we help them do that?</p>
<p>We have created a service
called NVIDIA AI Foundation.</p>
<p>It is a cloud service that
captures NVIDIA&rsquo;s AI expertise</p>
<p>and makes it possible for you
to train your own AI models.</p>
<p>We will help you develop
your own AI models</p>
<p>with supervised fine
tuning, with guard railing,</p>
<p>with proprietary knowledge bases</p>
<p>and reinforcement learning human feedback,</p>
<p>so that this AI model is
perfect for your application.</p>
<p>We then deploy this model to
run on Nvidia AI Enterprise.</p>
<p>This is the operating system</p>
<p>that I was talking to you about earlier.</p>
<p>This operating system runs
in every single cloud.</p>
<p>This allows this very simple system</p>
<p>with Nvidia AI Foundation for
training large language models</p>
<p>and deploying the language
model into Nvidia AI Enterprise,</p>
<p>which is available in every single model,</p>
<p>every single cloud in, on-prem,</p>
<p>allows every single enterprise
to be able to engage.</p>
<p>Now, one of the things that
very few people realize</p>
<p>is that today there&rsquo;s
only one software stack</p>
<p>that is enterprise secure
and enterprise grade.</p>
<p>That software stack is CPU.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is</p>
<p>because in order to be enterprise grade,</p>
<p>it has to be enterprise secure,</p>
<p>it has to be enterprise managed</p>
<p>and enterprise supported
across its entire life,</p>
<p>across its lifecycle.</p>
<p>There are so much software
in accelerated computing.</p>
<p>Over 4,000 software
packages is what it takes</p>
<p>for people to use
accelerated computing today.</p>
<p>In data processing and
training and optimization,</p>
<p>all the way to inference.</p>
<p>So for the very first time,</p>
<p>we are taking all of that software</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna maintain it</p>
<p>and manage it like Red Hat does for Linux.</p>
<p>Nvidia AI Enterprise will do it</p>
<p>for all of NVIDIA&rsquo;s libraries.</p>
<p>Now, enterprise can finally have</p>
<p>an enterprise grade and
enterprise secure software stack.</p>
<p>This is such a big deal.</p>
<p>Otherwise,</p>
<p>even though the promise
of accelerated computing</p>
<p>is possible for many
researchers and scientists,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not available for
enterprise companies.</p>
<p>And so let&rsquo;s take a look
at the benefit for them.</p>
<p>This is a simple image
processing application.</p>
<p>If you were to do it on
a CPU versus on a GPU</p>
<p>running on enterprise
Nvidia AI Enterprise,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting 31.8 images per minute</p>
<p>or basically 24 times the throughput,</p>
<p>or you only pay 5% of the cost.</p>
<p>This is really quite amazing.</p>
<p>This is the benefit of accelerated
computing in the cloud.</p>
<p>But for many companies,
enterprises is simply not possible</p>
<p>unless you have the stack.</p>
<p>Nvidia AI Enterprise is
now fully integrated into</p>
<p>AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft
Azure and Oracle Cloud.</p>
<p>And so when you go and deploy
your workloads in those clouds</p>
<p>and you want software
that is enterprise grade,</p>
<p>or if you have customers that
need enterprise grade software</p>
<p>Nvidia AI Enterprise is ready for you.</p>
<p>It is also integrated into the world&rsquo;s</p>
<p>machine learning operations pipeline.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before,</p>
<p>AI is a different type of workload</p>
<p>and this type of, new type of software,</p>
<p>this new type of software has
a whole new software industry.</p>
<p>And this software industry,</p>
<p>a hundred percent of them,</p>
<p>we have now connected
with Nvidia AI Enterprise.</p>
<p>Now lemme talk to you
about the next phase of AI,</p>
<p>where AI meets a digital twin.</p>
<p>Now, why does AI need a digital twin?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna explain that in just a second,</p>
<p>but first, let me show you
what you can do with it.</p>
<p>In order for AI to have a digital twin,</p>
<p>in order for AI to
understand heavy industry,</p>
<p>remember, so far AI has only
been used for light industry,</p>
<p>information, words, images,
music, so on and so forth.</p>
<p>If we want to use AI for heavy industry,</p>
<p>the $50 trillion of manufacturing,</p>
<p>many of that you&rsquo;re part of,</p>
<p>the trillions of dollars of healthcare,</p>
<p>all of the different manufacturing sites,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re building
chip fabs or battery plants</p>
<p>or electric vehicle
manufacturing factories,</p>
<p>all of these would have to be digitized</p>
<p>in order for artificial
intelligence to be used,</p>
<p>to automate, to design,
to build and to automate</p>
<p>the future of your business.</p>
<p>And so the first thing that we have to do</p>
<p>is we have to create the
ability for their world</p>
<p>to be represented in digital.</p>
<p>Okay, so number one is digitalization.</p>
<p>Well, why does it, how would you use that?</p>
<p>So let me give you just simple example.</p>
<p>In the future, you
would say to your robot,</p>
<p>I would like you to do something,</p>
<p>and the robot will understand your words</p>
<p>and it would generate animation.</p>
<p>Remember I said earlier,</p>
<p>you can go from text to text,</p>
<p>you can go from text to image,</p>
<p>you can go from text to music.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t you go from text to animation?</p>
<p>And so of course, in the future,</p>
<p>robotics will be highly revolutionized</p>
<p>by the technology we
already have in front of us.</p>
<p>However,</p>
<p>how does this robot know</p>
<p>that the motion that it is generating</p>
<p>is grounded in reality?</p>
<p>It is grounded in physics.</p>
<p>You need a software system</p>
<p>that understands the laws of physics.</p>
<p>Now, you&rsquo;ve actually seen
this already with ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Whereas AI, Nvidia AI,
would use Nvidia Omniverse</p>
<p>as in a reinforcement learning
loop to ground itself.</p>
<p>You have seen ChatGPT do this</p>
<p>using reinforcement
learning human feedback.</p>
<p>Using human&rsquo;s feedback</p>
<p>ChatGPT was able to be developed</p>
<p>by grounding it to
humans&rsquo;, well, sensibility,</p>
<p>and align it with our principles.</p>
<p>So reinforcement learning
with human feedback</p>
<p>is really important.</p>
<p>Reinforcement learning
for physics feedback</p>
<p>is very important.</p>
<p>Let me show you everything</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re about to see is a simulation.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s roll it, please.</p>
<p>(calm music plays)</p>
<p>(rousing music plays)</p>
<p>(rousing music continues)</p>
<p>(calm music plays)</p>
<p>(rousing music plays)</p>
<p>Everything was a simulation.</p>
<p>Nothing was art,
everything was simulation.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that amazing?</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<p>In the last 25 years,</p>
<p>I come to Taiwan, you sell me things.</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>Omniverse will be the first
thing I&rsquo;m gonna sell you.</p>
<p>And this,</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<p>because this will help you
revolutionize your business</p>
<p>and turn it into a digital business</p>
<p>and automate it With AI.</p>
<p>You will build products in digital first,</p>
<p>before you make it physical,</p>
<p>you will build factories
and plan it in digital first</p>
<p>before you make it in physical.</p>
<p>And so in the future,
Omniverse is a very big deal.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m gonna show you very quickly,</p>
<p>Omniverse in the cloud.</p>
<p>Omniverse, the entire
stack is so complicated.</p>
<p>And so we put the whole thing
into a cloud managed service</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hosted in Azure.</p>
<p>This particular experience
you&rsquo;re gonna have,</p>
<p>the computer is in California.</p>
<p>And Sean, I&rsquo;m sorry I took so much time,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re gonna have to (indistinct).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Sean] We&rsquo;ll go quick.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Jensen Huang] Okay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Sean] So this is,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>let&rsquo;s take a look at the Omniverse cloud.</p>
<p>So this is, you know, just a browser.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re looking now into
Omniverse Factory Explorer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s running 10,000 kilometers away</p>
<p>in our Santa Clara headquarters,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re leveraging the
power of our data center now</p>
<p>to visualize this factory floor.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve, using real factory data</p>
<p>from Simmons and Autodesk
Revit to take a look.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cloud application,</p>
<p>so we can have multiple
users collaborating.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go ahead and bring up Eloise screen.</p>
<p>And we can see,</p>
<p>now we have these two
users in this environment,</p>
<p>and Jeff on the left there
is gonna look at some markup.</p>
<p>We have this task to perform.</p>
<p>We need to move this object.</p>
<p>So we can have Eloise just go ahead</p>
<p>and grab that conveyor belt, move it over,</p>
<p>and as he does so,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see that it&rsquo;s reflected</p>
<p>accurately and completely in
real time on Jeff&rsquo;s screen.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re able to collaborate
with multiple users.</p>
<p>And even in bringing up this demo,</p>
<p>we had users from around the
globe working on the process.</p>
<p>East and West Coast, United
States, Germany, even Sydney,</p>
<p>and of course here in
Taipei to put this together.</p>
<p>Now, as we, if we&rsquo;re
modifying our production line,</p>
<p>of course one of the
things we&rsquo;ll want to do</p>
<p>is add the necessary safety equipment.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re able to simply drag
and drop items into Omniverse</p>
<p>and modify this production environment</p>
<p>and begin tweaking this</p>
<p>and optimizing for performance</p>
<p>even before we break
around with construction.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Jensen Huang] That is so cool.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is in California,</p>
<p>6,264 miles away or something like that.</p>
<p>34 milliseconds by speed of light one way.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s completely interactive.</p>
<p>Everything is Ray traced.</p>
<p>No art is necessary.</p>
<p>You bring everything, the
entire CAD into Omniverse,</p>
<p>open up a browser,</p>
<p>bring your data in,</p>
<p>bring your factory in.</p>
<p>No art is necessary.</p>
<p>The lighting just does
what the lighting does,</p>
<p>physics does what the physics does,</p>
<p>if you wanna turn off physics, you can,</p>
<p>if you wanna turn on physics, you can.</p>
<p>And multiple users, as many as you like,</p>
<p>can enter the Omniverse at the
same time and work together.</p>
<p>One unified source of data
across your entire company.</p>
<p>You could virtually build,</p>
<p>you could virtually design and build</p>
<p>and operate your factory</p>
<p>before you break ground
and not make the mistake,</p>
<p>which usually in the
beginning of the integration</p>
<p>creates a lot of change orders,</p>
<p>which costs a lot of money.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Sean.</p>
<p>Good job.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<p>Not only, notice just now,</p>
<p>it was humans interacting with Omniverse,</p>
<p>humans interacting with Omniverse.</p>
<p>In the future, Sean will
even have a generative AI,</p>
<p>an AI interact with him in Omniverse.</p>
<p>We could, of course,</p>
<p>imagine in the very beginning</p>
<p>there was (indistinct)
that could be a character,</p>
<p>that could be one of
the users of Omniverse</p>
<p>interacting with you, answering
questions, helping you.</p>
<p>We can also use generative AI</p>
<p>to help us create virtual worlds.</p>
<p>So for example, this is a bottle</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s rendered in Omniverse</p>
<p>that could be placed in a whole bunch</p>
<p>of different type of environments.</p>
<p>It could render beautifully physically.</p>
<p>You could place it just by
giving it a prompt by saying,</p>
<p>I would like to put this life,</p>
<p>put these bottles in a lifestyle
photograph style backdrop</p>
<p>for of modern warm farmhouse bathroom.</p>
<p>Changed the background,</p>
<p>everything is all integrated
and rendered again.</p>
<p>Okay, so generative AI will
come together with Omniverse</p>
<p>to assist the virtual, the the
creation of virtual worlds.</p>
<p>Today we&rsquo;re announcing that WPP,</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s largest advertising agency</p>
<p>and advertising services company</p>
<p>is partnering with Nvidia to build</p>
<p>a content generation engine</p>
<p>based on Omniverse and generative AI.</p>
<p>It integrates tools from so
many different other partners,</p>
<p>Adobe Firefly for example,
Getty, Shutterstock.</p>
<p>And it integrates into
this entire environment</p>
<p>and it makes it possible for them</p>
<p>to generate unique content
for different users,</p>
<p>for ad applications. for example.</p>
<p>So in the future, whenever
you engage a particular ad,</p>
<p>it could be generated just for you,</p>
<p>but yet the product is precisely rendered,</p>
<p>because of course the product
integrity is very important.</p>
<p>And so every time that you engage</p>
<p>a particular ad in the future,</p>
<p>today it was retrieved,</p>
<p>and today the computing model,</p>
<p>when you engage information,
it is retrieved.</p>
<p>In the future when you engage information,</p>
<p>much of it will be generated.</p>
<p>Notice the computing model has changed.</p>
<p>WPP generates 25% of the
ads that the world sees.</p>
<p>60% of the world&rsquo;s largest
companies are already clients.</p>
<p>And so they made a video</p>
<p>of how they would use this technology.</p>
<p>(calm music plays)</p>

The world&rsquo;s industries</li>

<p>are racing to realize the benefits of AI.</p>
<p>Nvidia and WPP are
building a groundbreaking</p>

<p>to enable the next evolution</p>
<p>of the $700 billion digital
advertising industry.</p>

<p>this engine gives brands the ability</p>
<p>to build and deploy highly personalized</p>
<p>and compelling visual content,</p>
<p>faster and more efficiently
than ever before.</p>
<p>The process starts by building</p>
<p>a physically accurate
digital twin of a product</p>
<p>using Omniverse Cloud,</p>
<p>which connects product design data</p>
<p>from industry standard tools.</p>
<p>Then WPP artists create customized
and diverse virtual sets</p>
<p>using a combination of
digitized environments</p>
<p>and generative AI tools by organizations,</p>
<p>such as Giddy Images and Adobe,</p>
<p>trained on fully licensed
data using Nvidia Picasso.</p>
<p>(rousing music plays)</p>
<p>This unique combination
of technologies allows WPP</p>
<p>to build accurate
photorealistic visual content</p>
<p>and e-commerce experiences</p>
<p>that bring new levels of realism
and scale to the industry.</p>

</ul>
<p>no problem, we continue.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s WPP.</p>
<p>You could see, you
could see, you could see</p>
<p>that that was an example.</p>
<p>If you think about a second,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an example of a company
using digital information</p>
<p>that was created in design,</p>
<p>and using that digital information
all the way in marketing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna show you now how
we&rsquo;re gonna use Omniverse and AI</p>
<p>here in Taiwan and we&rsquo;re gonna
use it for manufacturing.</p>
<p>Manufacturing, as you know,</p>
<p>is one of the largest
industries in the world.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna use Omniverse to teach in AI</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re gonna use Metropolis,</p>
<p>our AI deployment, Edge deployment
system, to deploy the AI.</p>
<p>Okay, run it.</p>
<p>(upbeat music plays)</p>
<ul>
<li>[Voice Off-Screen] The $45 trillion</li>
</ul>
<p>global manufacturing industry</p>
<p>is comprised of 10 million
factories operating 24/7.</p>
<p>Enterprises are racing to
become software defined</p>
<p>to ensure they can produce
high quality products</p>
<p>as quickly and cost
efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how electronics
manufacturer Pegatron</p>
<p>uses Nvidia AI and Omniverse
to digitalize their factories.</p>
<p>In Omniverse, they start by building</p>
<p>a digital twin of their factory,</p>
<p>unifying disparate 3D and CAD data sets</p>
<p>to provide a real-time view
of their complex factory data</p>
<p>to their planners and suppliers.</p>
<p>In the cloud native digital twin</p>
<p>planners can then
optimize layout virtually</p>
<p>before deploying changes
to the real factory.</p>
<p>The digital twin is also used</p>
<p>as a training ground at Data Factory,</p>
<p>for Pegatron&rsquo;s perception AIs.</p>
<p>They use Nvidia Isaacs
Sim built on Omniverse</p>
<p>to simulate and optimize
their fleet of mobile robots,</p>
<p>which help move materials
throughout the facility</p>
<p>as well as the pick and place robotic arms</p>
<p>that assist on production lines.</p>
<p>In the fully operational factory,</p>
<p>Pegatron deploys automated
optical inspection or AOI points</p>
<p>along their production lines,</p>
<p>which reduces cost and
increases line throughput.</p>
<p>Nvidia Metropolis enables Pegatron</p>
<p>to quickly develop and
deploy cloud native,</p>
<p>highly accurate AOI workflows</p>
<p>across their production lines.</p>
<p>Omnibus replicator generates
synthetic data sets</p>
<p>of PCBA defects,</p>
<p>which are too complex and costly</p>
<p>to capture in the real world,</p>
<p>like scratches and missing
or misaligned components.</p>
<p>Pegatron then combines the synthetic data</p>
<p>with Nvidia pre-trained models,</p>
<p>Nvidia TAO for training,
adaptation and optimization,</p>
<p>and NVIDIA DeepStream
for realtime inference.</p>
<p>Resulting in AOI performance</p>
<p>that is 99.8% accurate</p>
<p>with a four times
improvement in throughput.</p>
<p>With software defined factories</p>
<p>built on Nvidia AI and Omniverse</p>
<p>manufacturers can super
accelerate factory bring up</p>
<p>and minimize change orders,</p>
<p>continuously optimize operations,</p>
<p>maximize production line throughput,</p>
<p>all while reducing costs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you see that?</li>
</ul>
<p>The whole factory is an Omniverse.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely digital.</p>
<p>Imagine if you have digital
information in your hands,</p>
<p>what can you do with it?</p>
<p>Almost everything.</p>
<p>And so this is one of the
things that&rsquo;s really exciting.</p>
<p>What you just saw is basically
every factory in the future</p>
<p>will be digital, of course, first.</p>
<p>Every factory will be a robot.</p>
<p>Inside the factories
there will be other robots</p>
<p>that the factory is orchestrating.</p>
<p>We are also going to build
robots that move themselves.</p>
<p>So far the robots that
you saw are stationary.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re gonna also
have robots that move.</p>
<p>Everything that move in the future</p>
<p>will have artificial intelligence</p>
<p>and will have robotic capability.</p>
<p>And so today we&rsquo;re announcing
our robot platform,</p>
<p>Nvidia Isaac AMR is now
available as a reference design</p>
<p>for anybody who wants to build robots.</p>
<p>Just like we did with our
high performance computing.</p>
<p>Nvidia builds the whole stack.</p>
<p>And then we disaggregate it,</p>
<p>so that if you would like to
buy the chip, that&rsquo;s fine,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like to buy
the system, that&rsquo;s fine,</p>
<p>if you like to use your
software, that&rsquo;s fine,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d like to use our
software, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to use your own
algorithm, that&rsquo;s terrific,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like to use
ours, that&rsquo;s terrific.</p>
<p>However you would like to work with us,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re open for business.</p>
<p>So that we can help you
integrate accelerated computing</p>
<p>wherever you like.</p>
<p>In the future, we&rsquo;re gonna
do the same with robotics.</p>
<p>We built the entire
robotics stack top to bottom</p>
<p>from the chip to the algorithms.</p>
<p>We have state-of-the-art perception</p>
<p>for multi-modality sensors,</p>
<p>state-of-the-art mapping,</p>
<p>state-of-the-art
localization and planning,</p>
<p>and a cloud mapping system.</p>
<p>Everything has been created.</p>
<p>However you would like to use it.</p>
<p>You can use pieces of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s open, available for you,</p>
<p>including all the cloud mapping systems.</p>
<p>So this is Isaac AMR.</p>
<p>It includes, starts
with a chip called Orin.</p>
<p>It goes into a computer</p>
<p>and it goes into the Nvidia Nova Orin,</p>
<p>which is a reference system,</p>
<p>a blueprint for AMRs.</p>
<p>This is the most advanced
AMR in the world today.</p>
<p>And that entire stack has been built.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s take a look at it.</p>
<p>(upbeat music plays)</p>
<ul>
<li>[Voice Off-Screen]
To improve productivity</li>
</ul>
<p>and increase worker safety,</p>
<p>factories and warehouses
are migrating away</p>
<p>from manual forklifts and guided
vehicles to full autonomy.</p>
<p>Nvidia Isaac AMR provides an
integrated end-to-end solution</p>
<p>to deploy fully autonomous mobile robots.</p>
<p>The core of the solution is Nova Orin,</p>
<p>a sensor suite and computing hardware</p>
<p>that enables mapping,
autonomy and simulation.</p>
<p>Nova&rsquo;s collection of advanced sensors</p>
<p>speeds the mapping process,</p>
<p>leveraging our cloud-based service</p>
<p>to generate an accurate
and detailed 3D voxel map.</p>
<p>This 3D map can then be
sliced across a plane</p>
<p>to generate 2D maps tailored
for different autonomous robots</p>
<p>that might operate in a facility.</p>
<p>With these maps in place on robot lidar</p>
<p>or cost effective cameras</p>
<p>provide autonomous navigation</p>
<p>that works reliably in the most complex</p>
<p>and dynamic environments.</p>
<p>Isaac mission control
optimizes route planning</p>
<p>using the (indistinct) library.</p>
<p>To improve operations
developers can use Isaac Sim</p>
<p>and NVIDIA Omniverse to
create realistic digital twins</p>
<p>of the operating environment.</p>
<p>This allows fully autonomous robots</p>
<p>to be trained on complex
tasks entirely in simulation.</p>
<p>All operations can be fully validated</p>
<p>using Isaac Sim before
deployment to the real world.</p>
<p>Isaac AMR accelerates your
migration to full autonomy,</p>
<p>reducing costs, and speeding deployment</p>
<p>of the next generation of AMRs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nova cannot tell that it is not</li>
</ul>
<p>in the reality environment.</p>
<p>Nova thinks it is in the real environment.</p>
<p>It cannot tell.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is
because all the sensors work,</p>
<p>physics work, it can navigate,
it can localize itself.</p>
<p>Everything is physically based.</p>
<p>So therefore we could
design, we could design,</p>
<p>(speaks foreign language),</p>
<p>therefore we can design the robot,</p>
<p>simulate the robot,</p>
<p>train the robot all in Isaac,</p>
<p>and then we take the brain, Isaac Sim,</p>
<p>then we take the brain, the software,</p>
<p>and we put it into the actual robot.</p>
<p>And with some amount of adaptation,</p>
<p>it should be able to perform the same job.</p>
<p>This is the future of robotics.</p>
<p>Omniverse and AI working together.</p>
<p>The ecosystem that we have
been in, the IT ecosystem,</p>
<p>is a quarter of a
trillion dollars per year,</p>
<p>$250 billion a year.</p>
<p>This is the IT industry.</p>
<p>For the very first time
in our history together,</p>
<p>we finally have the ability to understand</p>
<p>the language of the physical world.</p>
<p>We can understand the
language of heavy industry</p>
<p>and we have a software tool.</p>
<p>We have a software system called Omniverse</p>
<p>that allows us to simulate, to develop,</p>
<p>to build and operate our physical plants,</p>
<p>our physical robots,</p>
<p>our physical assets,</p>
<p>as if they were digitally.</p>
<p>The excitement in the hard industries,</p>
<p>the heavy industries has been incredible.</p>
<p>We have been connecting
Omniverse all over the world</p>
<p>with tools companies, robotics
companies, sensor companies,</p>
<p>all kinds of industries.</p>
<p>There are three industries
right now as we speak</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s putting enormous
investments into the world.</p>
<p>Number one, of course, it&rsquo;s chip industry.</p>
<p>Number two, electric battery industry.</p>
<p>Number three, electric vehicle industry.</p>
<p>Trillions of dollars will be invested</p>
<p>in the next several years,</p>
<p>trillions of dollars will be invested</p>
<p>in the next several years.</p>
<p>And they would all like to do it better</p>
<p>and they would like to
do it in a modern way.</p>
<p>For the very first time
we now give them a system,</p>
<p>a platform, tools that
allows them to do that.</p>
<p>I wanna thank all of you for coming today.</p>
<p>I talked about many things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve seen you,</p>
<p>so I had so much to tell you.</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>It was too much,</p>
<p>it was too much.</p>
<p>Last night I said this is too much.</p>
<p>This morning I said this is too much.</p>
<p>And now I realize it&rsquo;s too much.</p>
<p>(speaks foreign language)</p>
<p>(audience laughs and applauds)</p>
<p>I told you, I told you several things.</p>
<p>I told you that we are going through two</p>
<p>simultaneous computing
industry transition,</p>
<p>accelerated computing and generative AI.</p>
<p>Two.</p>
<p>This form of computing</p>
<p>is not like the traditional
general purpose computing.</p>
<p>It is full stack.</p>
<p>It is data center scale</p>
<p>because the data center is the computer.</p>
<p>And it is domain specific,</p>
<p>for every domain that you want to go into,</p>
<p>every industry you go into,</p>
<p>you need to have the software stack.</p>
<p>And if you have the software stack,</p>
<p>then the utility, the
utilization of your machine,</p>
<p>the utilization of your
computer will be high.</p>
<p>So number two,</p>
<p>it is full stack data scanner
scale and domain specific.</p>
<p>We are in full production of
the engine of generative AI</p>
<p>and that is HGX H100.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, this engine that&rsquo;s
gonna be used for AI factories</p>
<p>will be scaled out using Grace Hopper,</p>
<p>the engine that we created
for the era of generative AI.</p>
<p>We also took Grace Hopper</p>
<p>and realized that we can
extend on the one hand</p>
<p>the performance,</p>
<p>but we also have to extend the fabric</p>
<p>so that we can make
larger models trainable.</p>
<p>And we took Grace Hopper
connected to 256 node NVLink</p>
<p>and created the largest GPU
in the world, DGX GH200.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to extend generative AI</p>
<p>and accelerated competing</p>
<p>in several different
directions at the same time.</p>
<p>Number one,</p>
<p>we would like to of course,
extend it in the cloud,</p>
<p>so that every cloud data center
can be an AI data center,</p>
<p>not just AI factories and hyperscale.</p>
<p>But every hyperscale data center</p>
<p>can now be a generative AI data center.</p>
<p>And the way we do that is the Spectrum-X.</p>
<p>It takes four components to
make Spectrum-X possible.</p>
<p>The switch, the BlueField-3 NIC,</p>
<p>the interconnects themselves,</p>
<p>the cables are so important
in high speed communications</p>
<p>and the software stack
that goes on top of it.</p>
<p>We would like to extend generative AI</p>
<p>to the world&rsquo;s enterprise.</p>
<p>And there are so many different
configurations of servers.</p>
<p>And the way we&rsquo;re doing
that with partnership</p>
<p>with our Taiwanese ecosystem,</p>
<p>the MGX modular accelerated
computing systems.</p>
<p>We put Nvidia in the cloud</p>
<p>so that every enterprise in the world</p>
<p>can engage us to create
generative AI models</p>
<p>and deploy it in a secure way, hyper,</p>
<p>in a enterprise grade,</p>
<p>enterprise secure way
in every single cloud.</p>
<p>And lastly,</p>
<p>we would like to extend AI to
the world&rsquo;s heavy industries,</p>
<p>the largest industries in the world.</p>
<p>So far our industry, our
industry that I&rsquo;ve been,</p>
<p>all of us been part of,</p>
<p>has been part, a small part
of the world&rsquo;s total industry.</p>
<p>For the very first time
the work that we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>can engage every single industry.</p>
<p>And we do that by automating
factories, automating robots.</p>
<p>And today we even announced our first</p>
<p>robotics full reference
stack, the Nova Orin,</p>
<p>I wanna thank all of you</p>
<p>for your partnership over the years.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
