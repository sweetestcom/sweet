    <p>The following is a conversation with Jeff Hawkins.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the founder of the Redwood Center</p>
<p>for Theoretical Neuroscience in 2002, and NuMenta in 2005.</p>
<p>In his 2004 book, titled On Intelligence,</p>
<p>and in the research before and after,</p>
<p>he and his team have worked to reverse engineer</p>
<p>the neural cortex, and propose artificial intelligence</p>
<p>architectures, approaches, and ideas</p>
<p>that are inspired by the human brain.</p>
<p>These ideas include Hierarchical Tupperware Memory,</p>
<p>HTM, from 2004, and new work,</p>
<p>the Thousand Brains Theory of Intelligence</p>
<p>from 2017, 18, and 19.</p>
<p>Jeff&rsquo;s ideas have been an inspiration</p>
<p>to many who have looked for progress</p>
<p>beyond the current machine learning approaches,</p>
<p>but they have also received criticism</p>
<p>for lacking a body of empirical evidence</p>
<p>supporting the models.</p>
<p>This is always a challenge when seeking more</p>
<p>than small incremental steps forward in AI.</p>
<p>Jeff is a brilliant mind, and many of the ideas</p>
<p>he has developed and aggregated from neuroscience</p>
<p>are worth understanding and thinking about.</p>
<p>There are limits to deep learning,</p>
<p>as it is currently defined.</p>
<p>Forward progress in AI is shrouded in mystery.</p>
<p>My hope is that conversations like this</p>
<p>can help provide an inspiring spark for new ideas.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, iTunes,</p>
<p>or simply connect with me on Twitter</p>
<p>at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Jeff Hawkins.</p>
<p>Are you more interested in understanding the human brain</p>
<p>or in creating artificial systems</p>
<p>that have many of the same qualities</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t necessarily require that you actually understand</p>
<p>the underpinning workings of our mind?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a clear answer to that question.</p>
<p>My primary interest is understanding the human brain.</p>
<p>No question about it.</p>
<p>But I also firmly believe that we will not be able</p>
<p>to create fully intelligent machines</p>
<p>until we understand how the human brain works.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t see those as separate problems.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s limits to what can be done</p>
<p>with machine intelligence if you don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>the principles by which the brain works.</p>
<p>And so I actually believe that studying the brain</p>
<p>is actually the fastest way to get to machine intelligence.</p>
<p>And within that, let me ask the impossible question,</p>
<p>how do you, not define, but at least think</p>
<p>about what it means to be intelligent?</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t try to answer that question first.</p>
<p>We said, let&rsquo;s just talk about how the brain works</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s figure out how certain parts of the brain,</p>
<p>mostly the neocortex, but some other parts too.</p>
<p>The parts of the brain most associated with intelligence.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s discover the principles by how they work.</p>
<p>Because intelligence isn&rsquo;t just like some mechanism</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not just some capabilities.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, we don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>where to begin on this stuff.</p>
<p>And so now that we&rsquo;ve made a lot of progress on this,</p>
<p>after we&rsquo;ve made a lot of progress</p>
<p>on how the neocortex works, and we can talk about that,</p>
<p>I now have a very good idea what&rsquo;s gonna be required</p>
<p>to make intelligent machines.</p>
<p>I can tell you today, some of the things</p>
<p>are gonna be necessary, I believe,</p>
<p>to create intelligent machines.</p>
<p>Well, so we&rsquo;ll get there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get to the neocortex and some of the theories</p>
<p>of how the whole thing works.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying, as we understand more and more</p>
<p>about the neocortex, about our own human mind,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be able to start to more specifically define</p>
<p>what it means to be intelligent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not useful to really talk about that until.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s not useful.</p>
<p>Look, there&rsquo;s a long history of AI, as you know.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s been different approaches taken to it.</p>
<p>And who knows, maybe they&rsquo;re all useful.</p>
<p>So the good old fashioned AI, the expert systems,</p>
<p>the current convolutional neural networks,</p>
<p>they all have their utility.</p>
<p>They all have a value in the world.</p>
<p>But I would think almost everyone agree</p>
<p>that none of them are really intelligent</p>
<p>in a sort of a deep way that humans are.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s just the question of how do you get</p>
<p>from where those systems were or are today</p>
<p>to where a lot of people think we&rsquo;re gonna go.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a big, big gap there, a huge gap.</p>
<p>And I think the quickest way of bridging that gap</p>
<p>is to figure out how the brain does that.</p>
<p>And then we can sit back and look and say,</p>
<p>oh, which of these principles that the brain works on</p>
<p>are necessary and which ones are not?</p>
<p>Clearly, we don&rsquo;t have to build this in,</p>
<p>and intelligent machines aren&rsquo;t gonna be built</p>
<p>out of organic living cells.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff that goes on the brain</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be necessary.</p>
<p>So let me ask maybe, before we get into the fun details,</p>
<p>let me ask maybe a depressing or a difficult question.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible that we will never</p>
<p>be able to understand how our brain works,</p>
<p>that maybe there&rsquo;s aspects to the human mind,</p>
<p>like we ourselves cannot introspectively get to the core,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a wall you eventually hit?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t believe that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>I have never believed that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not been a single thing humans have ever put</p>
<p>their minds to that we&rsquo;ve said, oh, we reached the wall,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t go any further.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, people keep saying that.</p>
<p>People used to believe that about life.</p>
<p>Alain Vital, right, there&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the difference between living matter</p>
<p>and nonliving matter, something special</p>
<p>that we never understand.</p>
<p>We no longer think that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no historical evidence that suggests this</p>
<p>is the case, and I just never even consider</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a possibility.</p>
<p>I would also say, today, we understand so much</p>
<p>about the neocortex.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve made tremendous progress in the last few years</p>
<p>that I no longer think of it as an open question.</p>
<p>The answers are very clear to me.</p>
<p>The pieces we don&rsquo;t know are clear to me,</p>
<p>but the framework is all there, and it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh, okay, we&rsquo;re gonna be able to do this.</p>
<p>This is not a problem anymore, just takes time and effort,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no mystery, a big mystery anymore.</p>
<p>So then let&rsquo;s get into it for people like myself</p>
<p>who are not very well versed in the human brain,</p>
<p>except my own.</p>
<p>Can you describe to me, at the highest level,</p>
<p>what are the different parts of the human brain,</p>
<p>and then zooming in on the neocortex,</p>
<p>the parts of the neocortex, and so on,</p>
<p>a quick overview.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>The human brain, we can divide it roughly into two parts.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the old parts, lots of pieces,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the new part.</p>
<p>The new part is the neocortex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s new because it didn&rsquo;t exist before mammals.</p>
<p>The only mammals have a neocortex,</p>
<p>and in humans, in primates, it&rsquo;s very large.</p>
<p>In the human brain, the neocortex occupies</p>
<p>about 70 to 75% of the volume of the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s huge.</p>
<p>And the old parts of the brain are,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s lots of pieces there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the spinal cord, and there&rsquo;s the brain stem,</p>
<p>and the cerebellum, and the different parts</p>
<p>of the basal ganglia, and so on.</p>
<p>In the old parts of the brain,</p>
<p>you have the autonomic regulation,</p>
<p>like breathing and heart rate.</p>
<p>You have basic behaviors, so like walking and running</p>
<p>are controlled by the old parts of the brain.</p>
<p>All the emotional centers of the brain</p>
<p>are in the old part of the brain,</p>
<p>so when you feel anger or hungry, lust,</p>
<p>or things like that, those are all</p>
<p>in the old parts of the brain.</p>
<p>And we associate with the neocortex</p>
<p>all the things we think about as sort of</p>
<p>high level perception and cognitive functions,</p>
<p>anything from seeing and hearing and touching things</p>
<p>to language to mathematics and engineering</p>
<p>and science and so on.</p>
<p>Those are all associated with the neocortex,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re certainly correlated.</p>
<p>Our abilities in those regards are correlated</p>
<p>with the relative size of our neocortex</p>
<p>compared to other mammals.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like the rough division,</p>
<p>and you obviously can&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>the neocortex completely isolated,</p>
<p>but you can understand a lot of it</p>
<p>with just a few interfaces to the old parts of the brain,</p>
<p>and so it gives you a system to study.</p>
<p>The other remarkable thing about the neocortex,</p>
<p>compared to the old parts of the brain,</p>
<p>is the neocortex is extremely uniform.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not visibly or anatomically,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very, I always like to say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the size of a dinner napkin,</p>
<p>about two and a half millimeters thick,</p>
<p>and it looks remarkably the same everywhere.</p>
<p>Everywhere you look in that two and a half millimeters</p>
<p>is this detailed architecture,</p>
<p>and it looks remarkably the same everywhere,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s across species.</p>
<p>A mouse versus a cat and a dog and a human.</p>
<p>Where if you look at the old parts of the brain,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s lots of little pieces do specific things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like the old parts of our brain evolved,</p>
<p>like this is the part that controls heart rate,</p>
<p>and this is the part that controls this,</p>
<p>and this is this kind of thing,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s this kind of thing,</p>
<p>and these evolved for eons a long, long time,</p>
<p>and they have their specific functions,</p>
<p>and all of a sudden mammals come along,</p>
<p>and they got this thing called the neocortex,</p>
<p>and it got large by just replicating the same thing</p>
<p>over and over and over again.</p>
<p>This is like, wow, this is incredible.</p>
<p>So all the evidence we have,</p>
<p>and this is an idea that was first articulated</p>
<p>in a very cogent and beautiful argument</p>
<p>by a guy named Vernon Malcastle in 1978, I think it was,</p>
<p>that the neocortex all works on the same principle.</p>
<p>So language, hearing, touch, vision, engineering,</p>
<p>all these things are basically underlying,</p>
<p>are all built on the same computational substrate.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really all the same problem.</p>
<p>So the low level of the building blocks all look similar.</p>
<p>Yeah, and they&rsquo;re not even that low level.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not talking about like neurons.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about this very complex circuit</p>
<p>that exists throughout the neocortex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s remarkably similar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yes, you see variations of it here and there,</p>
<p>more of the cell, less and less, and so on.</p>
<p>But what Malcastle argued was, he says,</p>
<p>you know, if you take a section of neocortex,</p>
<p>why is one a visual area and one is a auditory area?</p>
<p>Or why is, and his answer was,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because one is connected to eyes</p>
<p>and one is connected to ears.</p>
<p>Literally, you mean just it&rsquo;s most closest</p>
<p>in terms of number of connections</p>
<p>to the sensor. Literally, literally,</p>
<p>if you took the optic nerve and attached it</p>
<p>to a different part of the neocortex,</p>
<p>that part would become a visual region.</p>
<p>This actually, this experiment was actually done</p>
<p>by Merkankasur in developing, I think it was lemurs,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember what it was, some animal.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of evidence to this.</p>
<p>You know, if you take a blind person,</p>
<p>a person who&rsquo;s born blind at birth,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re born with a visual neocortex.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t, may not get any input from the eyes</p>
<p>because of some congenital defect or something.</p>
<p>And that region becomes, does something else.</p>
<p>It picks up another task.</p>
<p>So, and it&rsquo;s, so it&rsquo;s this very complex thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like, oh, they&rsquo;re all built on neurons.</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re all built in this very complex circuit</p>
<p>and somehow that circuit underlies everything.</p>
<p>And so this is the, it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>the common cortical algorithm, if you will.</p>
<p>Some scientists just find it hard to believe</p>
<p>and they just, I can&rsquo;t believe that&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>but the evidence is overwhelming in this case.</p>
<p>And so a large part of what it means</p>
<p>to figure out how the brain creates intelligence</p>
<p>and what is intelligence in the brain</p>
<p>is to understand what that circuit does.</p>
<p>If you can figure out what that circuit does,</p>
<p>as amazing as it is, then you can,</p>
<p>then you understand what all these</p>
<p>other cognitive functions are.</p>
<p>So if you were to sort of put neocortex</p>
<p>outside of your book on intelligence,</p>
<p>you look, if you wrote a giant tome, a textbook</p>
<p>on the neocortex, and you look maybe</p>
<p>a couple of centuries from now,</p>
<p>how much of what we know now would still be accurate</p>
<p>two centuries from now?</p>
<p>So how close are we in terms of understanding?</p>
<p>I have to speak from my own particular experience here.</p>
<p>So I run a small research lab here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like any other research lab.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sort of the principal investigator.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually two of us</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a bunch of other people.</p>
<p>And this is what we do.</p>
<p>We study the neocortex and we publish our results</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>So about three years ago,</p>
<p>we had a real breakthrough in this field.</p>
<p>Just tremendous breakthrough.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve now published, I think, three papers on it.</p>
<p>And so I have a pretty good understanding</p>
<p>of all the pieces and what we&rsquo;re missing.</p>
<p>I would say that almost all the empirical data</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve collected about the brain, which is enormous.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know the neuroscience literature,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just incredibly big.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, for the most part, all correct.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s facts and experimental results and measurements</p>
<p>and all kinds of stuff.</p>
<p>But none of that has been really assimilated</p>
<p>into a theoretical framework.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s data without, in the language of Thomas Kuhn,</p>
<p>the historian, would be a sort of a pre paradigm science.</p>
<p>Lots of data, but no way to fit it together.</p>
<p>I think almost all of that&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just gonna be some mistakes in there.</p>
<p>And for the most part,</p>
<p>there aren&rsquo;t really good cogent theories about it,</p>
<p>how to put it together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like we have two or three competing good theories,</p>
<p>which ones are right and which ones are wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, nah, people are just scratching their heads.</p>
<p>Some people have given up</p>
<p>on trying to figure out what the whole thing does.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s very, very few labs that we do</p>
<p>that focus really on theory</p>
<p>and all this unassimilated data and trying to explain it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;ve got it wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that we haven&rsquo;t got it at all.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really, I would say, pretty early days</p>
<p>in terms of understanding the fundamental theory&rsquo;s forces</p>
<p>of the way our mind works.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I would have said that&rsquo;s true five years ago.</p>
<p>So as I said,</p>
<p>we had some really big breakthroughs on this recently</p>
<p>and we started publishing papers on this.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll get to that.</p>
<p>But so I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an optimist and from where I sit today,</p>
<p>most people would disagree with this,</p>
<p>but from where I sit today, from what I know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not super early days anymore.</p>
<p>We are, the way these things go</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s not a linear path, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t just start accumulating</p>
<p>and get better and better and better.</p>
<p>No, all this stuff you&rsquo;ve collected,</p>
<p>none of it makes sense.</p>
<p>All these different things are just sort of around.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re gonna have some breaking points</p>
<p>where all of a sudden, oh my God, now we got it right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it goes in science.</p>
<p>And I personally feel like we passed that little thing</p>
<p>about a couple of years ago,</p>
<p>all that big thing a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>So we can talk about that.</p>
<p>Time will tell if I&rsquo;m right,</p>
<p>but I feel very confident about it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m willing to say it on tape like this.</p>
<p>At least very optimistic.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s, before those few years ago,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take a step back to HTM,</p>
<p>the hierarchical temporal memory theory,</p>
<p>which you first proposed on intelligence</p>
<p>and went through a few different generations.</p>
<p>Can you describe what it is,</p>
<p>how it evolved through the three generations</p>
<p>since you first put it on paper?</p>
<p>Yeah, so one of the things that neuroscientists</p>
<p>just sort of missed for many, many years,</p>
<p>and especially people who were thinking about theory,</p>
<p>was the nature of time in the brain.</p>
<p>Brains process information through time.</p>
<p>The information coming into the brain</p>
<p>is constantly changing.</p>
<p>The patterns from my speech right now,</p>
<p>if you were listening to it at normal speed,</p>
<p>would be changing on your ears</p>
<p>about every 10 milliseconds or so, you&rsquo;d have a change.</p>
<p>This constant flow, when you look at the world,</p>
<p>your eyes are moving constantly,</p>
<p>three to five times a second,</p>
<p>and the input&rsquo;s completely changing.</p>
<p>If I were to touch something like a coffee cup,</p>
<p>as I move my fingers, the input changes.</p>
<p>So this idea that the brain works on time changing patterns</p>
<p>is almost completely, or was almost completely missing</p>
<p>from a lot of the basic theories,</p>
<p>like fears of vision and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh no, we&rsquo;re gonna put this image</p>
<p>in front of you and flash it and say, what is it?</p>
<p>Convolutional neural networks work that way today, right?</p>
<p>Classify this picture.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not what vision is like.</p>
<p>Vision is this sort of crazy time based pattern</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going all over the place,</p>
<p>and so is touch and so is hearing.</p>
<p>So the first part of hierarchical temporal memory</p>
<p>was the temporal part.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to say, you won&rsquo;t understand the brain,</p>
<p>nor will you understand intelligent machines</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re dealing with time based patterns.</p>
<p>The second thing was, the memory component of it was,</p>
<p>is to say that we aren&rsquo;t just processing input,</p>
<p>we learn a model of the world.</p>
<p>And the memory stands for that model.</p>
<p>The point of the brain, the part of the neocortex,</p>
<p>it learns a model of the world.</p>
<p>We have to store things, our experiences,</p>
<p>in a form that leads to a model of the world.</p>
<p>So we can move around the world,</p>
<p>we can pick things up and do things and navigate</p>
<p>and know how it&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what the memory referred to.</p>
<p>And many people just, they were thinking about</p>
<p>like certain processes without memory at all.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just like processing things.</p>
<p>And then finally, the hierarchical component</p>
<p>was a reflection to that the neocortex,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s this uniform sheet of cells,</p>
<p>different parts of it project to other parts,</p>
<p>which project to other parts.</p>
<p>And there is a sort of rough hierarchy in terms of that.</p>
<p>So the hierarchical temporal memory is just saying,</p>
<p>look, we should be thinking about the brain</p>
<p>as time based, model memory based,</p>
<p>and hierarchical processing.</p>
<p>And that was a placeholder for a bunch of components</p>
<p>that we would then plug into that.</p>
<p>We still believe all those things I just said,</p>
<p>but we now know so much more that I&rsquo;m stopping to use</p>
<p>the word hierarchical temporal memory yet</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s insufficient to capture the stuff we know.</p>
<p>So again, it&rsquo;s not incorrect, but it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I now know more and I would rather describe it</p>
<p>more accurately.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you&rsquo;re basically, we could think of HTM</p>
<p>as emphasizing that there&rsquo;s three aspects of intelligence</p>
<p>that are important to think about</p>
<p>whatever the eventual theory it converges to.</p>
<p>So in terms of time, how do you think of nature of time</p>
<p>across different time scales?</p>
<p>So you mentioned things changing,</p>
<p>sensory inputs changing every 10, 20 minutes.</p>
<p>What about every few minutes, every few months and years?</p>
<p>Well, if you think about a neuroscience problem,</p>
<p>the brain problem, neurons themselves can stay active</p>
<p>for certain periods of time, parts of the brain</p>
<p>where they stay active for minutes.</p>
<p>You could hold a certain perception or an activity</p>
<p>for a certain period of time,</p>
<p>but most of them don&rsquo;t last that long.</p>
<p>And so if you think about your thoughts</p>
<p>are the activity of neurons,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna wanna involve something</p>
<p>that happened a long time ago,</p>
<p>even just this morning, for example,</p>
<p>the neurons haven&rsquo;t been active throughout that time.</p>
<p>So you have to store that.</p>
<p>So if I ask you, what did you have for breakfast today?</p>
<p>That is memory, that is you&rsquo;ve built into your model</p>
<p>the world now, you remember that.</p>
<p>And that memory is in the synapses,</p>
<p>is basically in the formation of synapses.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re sliding into what,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s the different timescales.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s timescales of which we are like understanding</p>
<p>my language and moving about and seeing things rapidly</p>
<p>and over time, that&rsquo;s the timescales</p>
<p>of activities of neurons.</p>
<p>But if you wanna get in longer timescales,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s more memory.</p>
<p>And we have to invoke those memories to say,</p>
<p>oh yes, well now I can remember what I had for breakfast</p>
<p>because I stored that someplace.</p>
<p>I may forget it tomorrow, but I&rsquo;d store it for now.</p>
<p>So does memory also need to have,</p>
<p>so the hierarchical aspect of reality</p>
<p>is not just about concepts, it&rsquo;s also about time?</p>
<p>Do you think of it that way?</p>
<p>Yeah, time is infused in everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you really can&rsquo;t separate it out.</p>
<p>If I ask you, what is your, you know,</p>
<p>how&rsquo;s the brain learn a model of this coffee cup here?</p>
<p>I have a coffee cup and I&rsquo;m at the coffee cup.</p>
<p>I say, well, time is not an inherent property</p>
<p>of the model I have of this cup,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a visual model or a tactile model.</p>
<p>I can sense it through time,</p>
<p>but the model itself doesn&rsquo;t really have much time.</p>
<p>If I asked you, if I said,</p>
<p>well, what is the model of my cell phone?</p>
<p>My brain has learned a model of the cell phone.</p>
<p>So if you have a smartphone like this,</p>
<p>and I said, well, this has time aspects to it.</p>
<p>I have expectations when I turn it on,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s gonna happen, what or how long it&rsquo;s gonna take</p>
<p>to do certain things, if I bring up an app,</p>
<p>what sequences, and so I have,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like melodies in the world, you know?</p>
<p>Melody has a sense of time.</p>
<p>So many things in the world move and act,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a sense of time related to them.</p>
<p>Some don&rsquo;t, but most things do actually.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sort of infused throughout the models of the world.</p>
<p>You build a model of the world,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re learning the structure of the objects in the world,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re also learning how those things change</p>
<p>through time.</p>
<p>Okay, so it really is just a fourth dimension</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s infused deeply, and you have to make sure</p>
<p>that your models of intelligence incorporate it.</p>
<p>So, like you mentioned, the state of neuroscience</p>
<p>is deeply empirical, a lot of data collection.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, that&rsquo;s where it is.</p>
<p>You mentioned Thomas Kuhn, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re proposing a theory of intelligence,</p>
<p>and which is really the next step,</p>
<p>the really important step to take,</p>
<p>but why is HTM, or what we&rsquo;ll talk about soon,</p>
<p>the right theory?</p>
<p>So is it more in the, is it backed by intuition?</p>
<p>Is it backed by evidence?</p>
<p>Is it backed by a mixture of both?</p>
<p>Is it kind of closer to where string theory is in physics,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s mathematical components</p>
<p>which show that, you know what,</p>
<p>it seems that this, it fits together too well</p>
<p>for it not to be true, which is where string theory is.</p>
<p>Is that where you&rsquo;re kind of seeing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mixture of all those things,</p>
<p>although definitely where we are right now</p>
<p>is definitely much more on the empirical side</p>
<p>than, let&rsquo;s say, string theory.</p>
<p>The way this goes about, we&rsquo;re theorists, right?</p>
<p>So we look at all this data, and we&rsquo;re trying to come up</p>
<p>with some sort of model that explains it, basically,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s, unlike string theory,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s vast more amounts of empirical data here</p>
<p>that I think than most physicists deal with.</p>
<p>And so our challenge is to sort through that</p>
<p>and figure out what kind of constructs would explain this.</p>
<p>And when we have an idea,</p>
<p>you come up with a theory of some sort,</p>
<p>you have lots of ways of testing it.</p>
<p>First of all, there are 100 years of assimilated,</p>
<p>assimilated, unassimilated empirical data from neuroscience.</p>
<p>So we go back and read papers,</p>
<p>and we say, oh, did someone find this already?</p>
<p>We can predict X, Y, and Z,</p>
<p>and maybe no one&rsquo;s even talked about it</p>
<p>since 1972 or something, but we go back and find that,</p>
<p>and we say, oh, either it can support the theory</p>
<p>or it can invalidate the theory.</p>
<p>And we say, okay, we have to start over again.</p>
<p>Oh, no, it&rsquo;s supportive, let&rsquo;s keep going with that one.</p>
<p>So the way I kind of view it, when we do our work,</p>
<p>we look at all this empirical data,</p>
<p>and what I call it is a set of constraints.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not interested in something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s biologically inspired.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to figure out how the actual brain works.</p>
<p>So every piece of empirical data</p>
<p>is a constraint on a theory.</p>
<p>In theory, if you have the correct theory,</p>
<p>it needs to explain every pin, right?</p>
<p>So we have this huge number of constraints on the problem,</p>
<p>which initially makes it very, very difficult.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have many constraints,</p>
<p>you can make up stuff all the day.</p>
<p>You can say, oh, here&rsquo;s an answer on how you can do this,</p>
<p>you can do that, you can do this.</p>
<p>But if you consider all biology as a set of constraints,</p>
<p>all neuroscience as a set of constraints,</p>
<p>and even if you&rsquo;re working in one little part</p>
<p>of the neocortex, for example,</p>
<p>there are hundreds and hundreds of constraints.</p>
<p>These are empirical constraints</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s very, very difficult initially</p>
<p>to come up with a theoretical framework for that.</p>
<p>But when you do, and it solves all those constraints</p>
<p>at once, you have a high confidence</p>
<p>that you got something close to correct.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just mathematically almost impossible not to be.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the curse and the advantage of what we have.</p>
<p>The curse is we have to solve,</p>
<p>we have to meet all these constraints, which is really hard.</p>
<p>But when you do meet them,</p>
<p>then you have a great confidence</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve discovered something.</p>
<p>In addition, then we work with scientific labs.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll say, oh, there&rsquo;s something we can&rsquo;t find,</p>
<p>we can predict something,</p>
<p>but we can&rsquo;t find it anywhere in the literature.</p>
<p>So we will then, we have people we&rsquo;ve collaborated with,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll say, sometimes they&rsquo;ll say, you know what?</p>
<p>I have some collected data, which I didn&rsquo;t publish,</p>
<p>but we can go back and look at it</p>
<p>and see if we can find that,</p>
<p>which is much easier than designing a new experiment.</p>
<p>You know, neuroscience experiments take a long time, years.</p>
<p>So, although some people are doing that now too.</p>
<p>So, but between all of these things,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a reasonable,</p>
<p>actually a very, very good approach.</p>
<p>We are blessed with the fact that we can test our theories</p>
<p>out the yin yang here because there&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>unassimilar data and we can also falsify our theories</p>
<p>very easily, which we do often.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of reminiscent to whenever that was</p>
<p>with Copernicus, you know, when you figure out</p>
<p>that the sun&rsquo;s at the center of the solar system</p>
<p>as opposed to earth, the pieces just fall into place.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s the general nature of aha moments</p>
<p>is, and it&rsquo;s Copernicus, it could be,</p>
<p>you could say the same thing about Darwin,</p>
<p>you could say the same thing about, you know,</p>
<p>about the double helix,</p>
<p>that people have been working on a problem for so long</p>
<p>and have all this data and they can&rsquo;t make sense of it,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t make sense of it.</p>
<p>But when the answer comes to you</p>
<p>and everything falls into place,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, oh my gosh, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s got to be right.</p>
<p>I asked both Jim Watson and Francis Crick about this.</p>
<p>I asked them, you know, when you were working on</p>
<p>trying to discover the structure of the double helix,</p>
<p>and when you came up with the sort of the structure</p>
<p>that ended up being correct, but it was sort of a guess,</p>
<p>you know, it wasn&rsquo;t really verified yet.</p>
<p>I said, did you know that it was right?</p>
<p>And they both said, absolutely.</p>
<p>So we absolutely knew it was right.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t matter if other people didn&rsquo;t believe it</p>
<p>or not, we knew it was right.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d get around to thinking it</p>
<p>and agree with it eventually anyway.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the kind of thing you hear a lot with scientists</p>
<p>who really are studying a difficult problem.</p>
<p>And I feel that way too about our work.</p>
<p>Have you talked to Crick or Watson about the problem</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to solve, the, of finding the DNA of the brain?</p>
<p>Yeah, in fact, Francis Crick was very interested in this</p>
<p>in the latter part of his life.</p>
<p>And in fact, I got interested in brains</p>
<p>by reading an essay he wrote in 1979</p>
<p>called Thinking About the Brain.</p>
<p>And that was when I decided I&rsquo;m gonna leave my profession</p>
<p>of computers and engineering and become a neuroscientist.</p>
<p>Just reading that one essay from Francis Crick.</p>
<p>I got to meet him later in life.</p>
<p>I spoke at the Salk Institute and he was in the audience.</p>
<p>And then I had a tea with him afterwards.</p>
<p>He was interested in a different problem.</p>
<p>He was focused on consciousness.</p>
<p>The easy problem, right?</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s the red herring.</p>
<p>And so we weren&rsquo;t really overlapping a lot there.</p>
<p>Jim Watson, who&rsquo;s still alive,</p>
<p>is also interested in this problem.</p>
<p>And he was, when he was director</p>
<p>of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories,</p>
<p>he was really sort of behind moving in the direction</p>
<p>of neuroscience there.</p>
<p>And so he had a personal interest in this field.</p>
<p>And I have met with him numerous times.</p>
<p>And in fact, the last time was a little bit over a year ago,</p>
<p>I gave a talk at Cold Spring Harbor Labs</p>
<p>about the progress we were making in our work.</p>
<p>And it was a lot of fun because he said,</p>
<p>well, you wouldn&rsquo;t be coming here</p>
<p>unless you had something important to say.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna go attend your talk.</p>
<p>So he sat in the very front row.</p>
<p>Next to him was the director of the lab, Bruce Stillman.</p>
<p>So these guys are in the front row of this auditorium.</p>
<p>Nobody else in the auditorium wants to sit in the front row</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s Jim Watson and there&rsquo;s the director.</p>
<p>And I gave a talk and then I had dinner with him afterwards.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a great picture of my colleague Subitai Amantak</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m up there sort of like screaming the basics</p>
<p>of this new framework we have.</p>
<p>And Jim Watson&rsquo;s on the edge of his chair.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s literally on the edge of his chair,</p>
<p>like intently staring up at the screen.</p>
<p>And when he discovered the structure of DNA,</p>
<p>the first public talk he gave</p>
<p>was at Cold Spring Harbor Labs.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a picture, there&rsquo;s a famous picture</p>
<p>of Jim Watson standing at the whiteboard</p>
<p>with an overrated thing pointing at something,</p>
<p>pointing at the double helix with his pointer.</p>
<p>And it actually looks a lot like the picture of me.</p>
<p>So there was a sort of funny,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s Arian talking about the brain</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s Jim Watson staring intently at it.</p>
<p>And of course there with, whatever, 60 years earlier,</p>
<p>he was standing pointing at the double helix.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the great discoveries in all of,</p>
<p>whatever, biology, science, all science and DNA.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s funny that there&rsquo;s echoes of that in your presentation.</p>
<p>Do you think, in terms of evolutionary timeline and history,</p>
<p>the development of the neocortex was a big leap?</p>
<p>Or is it just a small step?</p>
<p>So like, if we ran the whole thing over again,</p>
<p>from the birth of life on Earth,</p>
<p>how likely would we develop the mechanism of the neocortex?</p>
<p>Okay, well those are two separate questions.</p>
<p>One is, was it a big leap?</p>
<p>And one was how likely it is, okay?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not necessarily related.</p>
<p>Maybe correlated.</p>
<p>Maybe correlated, maybe not.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t really have enough data</p>
<p>to make a judgment about that.</p>
<p>I would say definitely it was a big leap.</p>
<p>And I can tell you why.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it was just another incremental step.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get that at the moment.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really have any idea how likely it is.</p>
<p>If we look at evolution,</p>
<p>we have one data point, which is Earth, right?</p>
<p>Life formed on Earth billions of years ago,</p>
<p>whether it was introduced here or it created it here,</p>
<p>or someone introduced it, we don&rsquo;t really know,</p>
<p>but it was here early.</p>
<p>It took a long, long time to get to multicellular life.</p>
<p>And then for multicellular life,</p>
<p>it took a long, long time to get the neocortex.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve only had the neocortex for a few 100,000 years.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like nothing, okay?</p>
<p>So is it likely?</p>
<p>Well, it certainly isn&rsquo;t something</p>
<p>that happened right away on Earth.</p>
<p>And there were multiple steps to get there.</p>
<p>So I would say it&rsquo;s probably not gonna be something</p>
<p>that would happen instantaneously</p>
<p>on other planets that might have life.</p>
<p>It might take several billion years on average.</p>
<p>Is it likely?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but you&rsquo;d have to survive</p>
<p>for several billion years to find out.</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>Is it a big leap?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it is a qualitative difference</p>
<p>in all other evolutionary steps.</p>
<p>I can try to describe that if you&rsquo;d like.</p>
<p>Sure, in which way?</p>
<p>Yeah, I can tell you how.</p>
<p>Pretty much, let&rsquo;s start with a little preface.</p>
<p>Many of the things that humans are able to do</p>
<p>do not have obvious survival advantages precedent.</p>
<p>We could create music, is that,</p>
<p>is there a really survival advantage to that?</p>
<p>Maybe, maybe not.</p>
<p>What about mathematics?</p>
<p>Is there a real survival advantage to mathematics?</p>
<p>Well, you could stretch it.</p>
<p>You can try to figure these things out, right?</p>
<p>But most of evolutionary history,</p>
<p>everything had immediate survival advantages to it.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;ll tell you a story, which I like,</p>
<p>may or may not be true, but the story goes as follows.</p>
<p>Organisms have been evolving for,</p>
<p>since the beginning of life here on Earth,</p>
<p>and adding this sort of complexity onto that,</p>
<p>and this sort of complexity onto that,</p>
<p>and the brain itself is evolved this way.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s old parts, and older parts,</p>
<p>and older, older parts of the brain</p>
<p>that kind of just keeps calming on new things,</p>
<p>and we keep adding capabilities.</p>
<p>When we got to the neocortex,</p>
<p>initially it had a very clear survival advantage</p>
<p>in that it produced better vision,</p>
<p>and better hearing, and better touch,</p>
<p>and maybe, and so on.</p>
<p>But what I think happens is that evolution discovered,</p>
<p>it took a mechanism, and this is in our recent theories,</p>
<p>but it took a mechanism evolved a long time ago</p>
<p>for navigating in the world, for knowing where you are.</p>
<p>These are the so called grid cells and place cells</p>
<p>of an old part of the brain.</p>
<p>And it took that mechanism for building maps of the world,</p>
<p>and knowing where you are on those maps,</p>
<p>and how to navigate those maps,</p>
<p>and turns it into a sort of a slimmed down,</p>
<p>idealized version of it.</p>
<p>And that idealized version could now apply</p>
<p>to building maps of other things.</p>
<p>Maps of coffee cups, and maps of phones,</p>
<p>maps of mathematics.</p>
<p>Concepts almost.</p>
<p>Concepts, yes, and not just almost, exactly.</p>
<p>And so, and it just started replicating this stuff, right?</p>
<p>You just think more, and more, and more.</p>
<p>So we went from being sort of dedicated purpose</p>
<p>neural hardware to solve certain problems</p>
<p>that are important to survival,</p>
<p>to a general purpose neural hardware</p>
<p>that could be applied to all problems.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s escaped the orbit of survival.</p>
<p>We are now able to apply it to things</p>
<p>which we find enjoyment,</p>
<p>but aren&rsquo;t really clearly survival characteristics.</p>
<p>And that it seems to only have happened in humans,</p>
<p>to the large extent.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>where we sort of have,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve sort of escaped the gravity of evolutionary pressure,</p>
<p>in some sense, in the neocortex.</p>
<p>And it now does things which are not,</p>
<p>that are really interesting,</p>
<p>discovering models of the universe,</p>
<p>which may not really help us.</p>
<p>Does it matter?</p>
<p>How does it help us surviving,</p>
<p>knowing that there might be multiverses,</p>
<p>or that there might be the age of the universe,</p>
<p>or how do various stellar things occur?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really help us survive at all.</p>
<p>But we enjoy it, and that&rsquo;s what happened.</p>
<p>Or at least not in the obvious way, perhaps.</p>
<p>It is required,</p>
<p>if you look at the entire universe in an evolutionary way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s required for us to do interplanetary travel,</p>
<p>and therefore survive past our own sun.</p>
<p>But you know, let&rsquo;s not get too.</p>
<p>Yeah, but evolution works at one time frame,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s survival, if you think of survival of the phenotype,</p>
<p>survival of the individual.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re talking about there is spans well beyond that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no genetic,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not transferring any genetic traits to my children</p>
<p>that are gonna help them survive better on Mars.</p>
<p>Totally different mechanism, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s get into the new, as you&rsquo;ve mentioned,</p>
<p>this idea of the, I don&rsquo;t know if you have a nice name,</p>
<p>thousand.</p>
<p>We call it the thousand brain theory of intelligence.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>Can you talk about this idea of a spatial view of concepts</p>
<p>and so on?</p>
<p>Yeah, so can I just describe sort of the,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an underlying core discovery,</p>
<p>which then everything comes from that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very simple, this is really what happened.</p>
<p>We were deep into problems about understanding</p>
<p>how we build models of stuff in the world</p>
<p>and how we make predictions about things.</p>
<p>And I was holding a coffee cup just like this in my hand.</p>
<p>And my finger was touching the side, my index finger.</p>
<p>And then I moved it to the top</p>
<p>and I was gonna feel the rim at the top of the cup.</p>
<p>And I asked myself a very simple question.</p>
<p>I said, well, first of all, I say,</p>
<p>I know that my brain predicts what it&rsquo;s gonna feel</p>
<p>before it touches it.</p>
<p>You can just think about it and imagine it.</p>
<p>And so we know that the brain&rsquo;s making predictions</p>
<p>all the time.</p>
<p>So the question is, what does it take to predict that?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a very interesting answer.</p>
<p>First of all, it says the brain has to know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s touching a coffee cup.</p>
<p>It has to have a model of a coffee cup.</p>
<p>It needs to know where the finger currently is</p>
<p>on the cup relative to the cup.</p>
<p>Because when I make a movement,</p>
<p>it needs to know where it&rsquo;s going to be on the cup</p>
<p>after the movement is completed relative to the cup.</p>
<p>And then it can make a prediction</p>
<p>about what it&rsquo;s gonna sense.</p>
<p>So this told me that the neocortex,</p>
<p>which is making this prediction,</p>
<p>needs to know that it&rsquo;s sensing it&rsquo;s touching a cup.</p>
<p>And it needs to know the location of my finger</p>
<p>relative to that cup in a reference frame of the cup.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter where the cup is relative to my body.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter its orientation.</p>
<p>None of that matters.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s where my finger is relative to the cup,</p>
<p>which tells me then that the neocortex</p>
<p>has a reference frame that&rsquo;s anchored to the cup.</p>
<p>Because otherwise I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to say the location</p>
<p>and I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to predict my new location.</p>
<p>And then we quickly, very instantly can say,</p>
<p>well, every part of my skin could touch this cup.</p>
<p>And therefore every part of my skin is making predictions</p>
<p>and every part of my skin must have a reference frame</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s using to make predictions.</p>
<p>So the big idea is that throughout the neocortex,</p>
<p>there are, everything is being stored</p>
<p>and referenced in reference frames.</p>
<p>You can think of them like XYZ reference frames,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not like that.</p>
<p>We know a lot about the neural mechanisms for this,</p>
<p>but the brain thinks in reference frames.</p>
<p>And as an engineer, if you&rsquo;re an engineer,</p>
<p>this is not surprising.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d say, if I wanted to build a CAD model</p>
<p>of the coffee cup, well, I would bring it up</p>
<p>and some CAD software, and I would assign</p>
<p>some reference frame and say this features</p>
<p>at this locations and so on.</p>
<p>But the fact that this, the idea that this is occurring</p>
<p>throughout the neocortex everywhere, it was a novel idea.</p>
<p>And then a zillion things fell into place after that,</p>
<p>a zillion.</p>
<p>So now we think about the neocortex</p>
<p>as processing information quite differently</p>
<p>than we used to do it.</p>
<p>We used to think about the neocortex</p>
<p>as processing sensory data and extracting features</p>
<p>from that sensory data and then extracting features</p>
<p>from the features, very much like a deep learning network</p>
<p>does today.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not how the brain works at all.</p>
<p>The brain works by assigning everything,</p>
<p>every input, everything to reference frames.</p>
<p>And there are thousands, hundreds of thousands</p>
<p>of them active at once in your neocortex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a surprising thing to think about,</p>
<p>but once you sort of internalize this,</p>
<p>you understand that it explains almost every,</p>
<p>almost all the mysteries we&rsquo;ve had about this structure.</p>
<p>So one of the consequences of that</p>
<p>is that every small part of the neocortex,</p>
<p>say a millimeter square, and there&rsquo;s 150,000 of those.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s about 150,000 square millimeters.</p>
<p>If you take every little square millimeter of the cortex,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got some input coming into it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna have reference frames</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s assigned that input to.</p>
<p>And each square millimeter can learn</p>
<p>complete models of objects.</p>
<p>So what do I mean by that?</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m touching the coffee cup,</p>
<p>well, if I just touch it in one place,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t learn what this coffee cup is</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m just feeling one part.</p>
<p>But if I move it around the cup</p>
<p>and touch it at different areas,</p>
<p>I can build up a complete model of the cup</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m now filling in that three dimensional map,</p>
<p>which is the coffee cup.</p>
<p>I can say, oh, what am I feeling</p>
<p>at all these different locations?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the basic idea, it&rsquo;s more complicated than that.</p>
<p>But so through time, and we talked about time earlier,</p>
<p>through time, even a single column,</p>
<p>which is only looking at, or a single part of the cortex,</p>
<p>which is only looking at a small part of the world,</p>
<p>can build up a complete model of an object.</p>
<p>And so if you think about the part of the brain,</p>
<p>which is getting input from all my fingers,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re spread across the top of your head here.</p>
<p>This is the somatosensory cortex.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s columns associated</p>
<p>with all the different areas of my skin.</p>
<p>And what we believe is happening</p>
<p>is that all of them are building models of this cup,</p>
<p>every one of them, or things.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not all building,</p>
<p>not every column or every part of the cortex</p>
<p>builds models of everything,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re all building models of something.</p>
<p>And so you have, so when I touch this cup with my hand,</p>
<p>there are multiple models of the cup being invoked.</p>
<p>If I look at it with my eyes,</p>
<p>there are, again, many models of the cup being invoked,</p>
<p>because each part of the visual system,</p>
<p>the brain doesn&rsquo;t process an image.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a misleading idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like your fingers touching the cup,</p>
<p>so different parts of my retina</p>
<p>are looking at different parts of the cup.</p>
<p>And thousands and thousands of models of the cup</p>
<p>are being invoked at once.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re all voting with each other,</p>
<p>trying to figure out what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why we call it the thousand brains theory</p>
<p>of intelligence, because there isn&rsquo;t one model of a cup.</p>
<p>There are thousands of models of this cup.</p>
<p>There are thousands of models of your cellphone</p>
<p>and about cameras and microphones and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a distributed modeling system,</p>
<p>which is very different</p>
<p>than the way people have thought about it.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a really compelling and interesting idea.</p>
<p>I have two first questions.</p>
<p>So one, on the ensemble part of everything coming together,</p>
<p>you have these thousand brains.</p>
<p>How do you know which one has done the best job</p>
<p>of forming the&hellip;</p>
<p>Great question.</p>
<p>Let me try to explain it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a problem that&rsquo;s known in neuroscience</p>
<p>called the sensor fusion problem.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And so the idea is there&rsquo;s something like,</p>
<p>oh, the image comes from the eye.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a picture on the retina</p>
<p>and then it gets projected to the neocortex.</p>
<p>Oh, by now it&rsquo;s all spread out all over the place</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of squirrely and distorted</p>
<p>and pieces are all over the&hellip;</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t look like a picture anymore.</p>
<p>When does it all come back together again?</p>
<p>Or you might say, well, yes,</p>
<p>but I also have sounds or touches associated with the cup.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m seeing the cup and touching the cup.</p>
<p>How do they get combined together again?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s called the sensor fusion problem.</p>
<p>As if all these disparate parts</p>
<p>have to be brought together into one model someplace.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the wrong idea.</p>
<p>The right idea is that you&rsquo;ve got all these guys voting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s auditory models of the cup.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s visual models of the cup.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s tactile models of the cup.</p>
<p>In the vision system,</p>
<p>there might be ones that are more focused on black and white</p>
<p>and ones focusing on color.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just thousands and thousands of models of this cup.</p>
<p>And they vote.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t actually come together in one spot.</p>
<p>Just literally think of it this way.</p>
<p>Imagine you have these columns</p>
<p>that are like about the size of a little piece of spaghetti.</p>
<p>Like a two and a half millimeters tall</p>
<p>and about a millimeter in wide.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not physical, but you could think of them that way.</p>
<p>And each one&rsquo;s trying to guess what this thing is</p>
<p>or touching.</p>
<p>Now, they can do a pretty good job</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re allowed to move over time.</p>
<p>So I can reach my hand into a black box</p>
<p>and move my finger around an object.</p>
<p>And if I touch enough spaces, I go, okay,</p>
<p>now I know what it is.</p>
<p>But often we don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Often I can just reach and grab something with my hand</p>
<p>all at once and I get it.</p>
<p>Or if I had to look through the world through a straw,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m only invoking one little column,</p>
<p>I can only see part of something</p>
<p>because I have to move the straw around.</p>
<p>But if I open my eyes, I see the whole thing at once.</p>
<p>So what we think is going on</p>
<p>is all these little pieces of spaghetti,</p>
<p>if you will, all these little columns in the cortex,</p>
<p>are all trying to guess what it is that they&rsquo;re sensing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll do a better guess if they have time</p>
<p>and can move over time.</p>
<p>So if I move my eyes, I move my fingers.</p>
<p>But if they don&rsquo;t, they have a poor guess.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a probabilistic guess of what they might be touching.</p>
<p>Now, imagine they can post their probability</p>
<p>at the top of a little piece of spaghetti.</p>
<p>Each one of them says,</p>
<p>I think, and it&rsquo;s not really a probability distribution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like a set of possibilities.</p>
<p>In the brain, it doesn&rsquo;t work as a probability distribution.</p>
<p>It works as more like what we call a union.</p>
<p>So you could say, and one column says,</p>
<p>I think it could be a coffee cup,</p>
<p>a soda can, or a water bottle.</p>
<p>And another column says,</p>
<p>I think it could be a coffee cup</p>
<p>or a telephone or a camera or whatever, right?</p>
<p>And all these guys are saying what they think it might be.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s these long range connections</p>
<p>in certain layers in the cortex.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s in some layers in some cells types</p>
<p>in each column, send the projections across the brain.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the voting occurs.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a simple associative memory mechanism.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve described this in a recent paper</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve modeled this that says,</p>
<p>they can all quickly settle on the only</p>
<p>or the one best answer for all of them.</p>
<p>If there is a single best answer,</p>
<p>they all vote and say, yep, it&rsquo;s gotta be the coffee cup.</p>
<p>And at that point, they all know it&rsquo;s a coffee cup.</p>
<p>And at that point, everyone acts as if it&rsquo;s a coffee cup.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, yep, we know it&rsquo;s a coffee,</p>
<p>even though I&rsquo;ve only seen one little piece of this world,</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s a coffee cup I&rsquo;m touching</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m seeing or whatever.</p>
<p>And so you can think of all these columns</p>
<p>are looking at different parts in different places,</p>
<p>different sensory input, different locations,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all different.</p>
<p>But this layer that&rsquo;s doing the voting, it solidifies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like it crystallizes and says,</p>
<p>oh, we all know what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And so you don&rsquo;t bring these models together in one model,</p>
<p>you just vote and there&rsquo;s a crystallization of the vote.</p>
<p>Great, that&rsquo;s at least a compelling way</p>
<p>to think about the way you form a model of the world.</p>
<p>Now, you talk about a coffee cup.</p>
<p>Do you see this, as far as I understand,</p>
<p>you are proposing this as well,</p>
<p>that this extends to much more than coffee cups?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>Or at least the physical world,</p>
<p>it expands to the world of concepts.</p>
<p>Yeah, it does.</p>
<p>And well, first, the primary thing is evidence for that</p>
<p>is that the regions of the neocortex</p>
<p>that are associated with language</p>
<p>or high level thought or mathematics</p>
<p>or things like that,</p>
<p>they look like the regions of the neocortex</p>
<p>that process vision, hearing, and touch.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t look any different.</p>
<p>Or they look only marginally different.</p>
<p>And so one would say, well, if Vernon Mountcastle,</p>
<p>who proposed that all the parts of the neocortex</p>
<p>do the same thing, if he&rsquo;s right,</p>
<p>then the parts that are doing language</p>
<p>or mathematics or physics</p>
<p>are working on the same principle.</p>
<p>They must be working on the principle of reference frames.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a little odd thought.</p>
<p>But of course, we had no prior idea</p>
<p>how these things happen.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go with that.</p>
<p>And we, in our recent paper,</p>
<p>we talked a little bit about that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on it more since.</p>
<p>I have better ideas about it now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sitting here very confident</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>And I can give you some examples</p>
<p>that help you think about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not we understand it completely,</p>
<p>but I understand it better than I&rsquo;ve described it</p>
<p>in any paper so far.</p>
<p>So, but we did put that idea out there.</p>
<p>It says, okay, this is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a good place to start, you know?</p>
<p>And the evidence would suggest it&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>And then we can start tackling that problem</p>
<p>one piece at a time.</p>
<p>Like, what does it mean to do high level thought?</p>
<p>What does it mean to do language?</p>
<p>How would that fit into a reference frame framework?</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you could tell me if there&rsquo;s a connection,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s an app called Anki</p>
<p>that helps you remember different concepts.</p>
<p>And they talk about like a memory palace</p>
<p>that helps you remember completely random concepts</p>
<p>by trying to put them in a physical space in your mind</p>
<p>and putting them next to each other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the method of loci.</p>
<p>Loci, yeah.</p>
<p>For some reason, that seems to work really well.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s a very narrow kind of application</p>
<p>of just remembering some facts.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a very, very telling one.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>So this seems like you&rsquo;re describing a mechanism</p>
<p>why this seems to work.</p>
<p>So basically the way what we think is going on</p>
<p>is all things you know, all concepts, all ideas,</p>
<p>words, everything you know are stored in reference frames.</p>
<p>And so if you want to remember something,</p>
<p>you have to basically navigate through a reference frame</p>
<p>the same way a rat navigates through a maze</p>
<p>and the same way my finger navigates to this coffee cup.</p>
<p>You are moving through some space.</p>
<p>And so if you have a random list of things</p>
<p>you were asked to remember,</p>
<p>by assigning them to a reference frame,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve already know very well to see your house, right?</p>
<p>And the idea of the method of loci is you can say,</p>
<p>okay, in my lobby, I&rsquo;m going to put this thing.</p>
<p>And then the bedroom, I put this one.</p>
<p>I go down the hall, I put this thing.</p>
<p>And then you want to recall those facts</p>
<p>or recall those things.</p>
<p>You just walk mentally, you walk through your house.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re mentally moving through a reference frame</p>
<p>that you already had.</p>
<p>And that tells you,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two things that are really important about that.</p>
<p>It tells us the brain prefers to store things</p>
<p>in reference frames.</p>
<p>And that the method of recalling things</p>
<p>or thinking, if you will,</p>
<p>is to move mentally through those reference frames.</p>
<p>You could move physically through some reference frames,</p>
<p>like I could physically move through the reference frame</p>
<p>of this coffee cup.</p>
<p>I can also mentally move through the reference frame</p>
<p>of the coffee cup, imagining me touching it.</p>
<p>But I can also mentally move my house.</p>
<p>And so now we can ask yourself,</p>
<p>or are all concepts stored this way?</p>
<p>There was some recent research using human subjects</p>
<p>in fMRI, and I&rsquo;m going to apologize for not knowing</p>
<p>the name of the scientists who did this.</p>
<p>But what they did is they put humans in this fMRI machine,</p>
<p>which is one of these imaging machines.</p>
<p>And they gave the humans tasks to think about birds.</p>
<p>So they had different types of birds,</p>
<p>and birds that look big and small,</p>
<p>and long necks and long legs, things like that.</p>
<p>And what they could tell from the fMRI</p>
<p>was a very clever experiment.</p>
<p>You get to tell when humans were thinking about the birds,</p>
<p>that the birds, the knowledge of birds</p>
<p>was arranged in a reference frame,</p>
<p>similar to the ones that are used</p>
<p>when you navigate in a room.</p>
<p>That these are called grid cells,</p>
<p>and there are grid cell like patterns of activity</p>
<p>in the neocortex when they do this.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very clever experiment.</p>
<p>And what it basically says,</p>
<p>that even when you&rsquo;re thinking about something abstract,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not really thinking about it as a reference frame,</p>
<p>it tells us the brain is actually using a reference frame.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s using the same neural mechanisms.</p>
<p>These grid cells are the basic same neural mechanism</p>
<p>that we propose that grid cells,</p>
<p>which exist in the old part of the brain,</p>
<p>the entorhinal cortex, that that mechanism</p>
<p>is now similar mechanism is used throughout the neocortex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same nature to preserve this interesting way</p>
<p>of creating reference frames.</p>
<p>And so now they have empirical evidence</p>
<p>that when you think about concepts like birds,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re using reference frames</p>
<p>that are built on grid cells.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s similar to the method of loci,</p>
<p>but in this case, the birds are related.</p>
<p>So they create their own reference frame,</p>
<p>which is consistent with bird space.</p>
<p>And when you think about something, you go through that.</p>
<p>You can make the same example,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take mathematics.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you wanna prove a conjecture.</p>
<p>What is a conjecture?</p>
<p>A conjecture is a statement you believe to be true,</p>
<p>but you haven&rsquo;t proven it.</p>
<p>And so it might be an equation.</p>
<p>I wanna show that this is equal to that.</p>
<p>And you have some places you start with.</p>
<p>You say, well, I know this is true,</p>
<p>and I know this is true.</p>
<p>And I think that maybe to get to the final proof,</p>
<p>I need to go through some intermediate results.</p>
<p>What I believe is happening is literally these equations</p>
<p>or these points are assigned to a reference frame,</p>
<p>a mathematical reference frame.</p>
<p>And when you do mathematical operations,</p>
<p>a simple one might be multiply or divide,</p>
<p>but you might be a little plus transform or something else.</p>
<p>That is like a movement in the reference frame of the math.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re literally trying to discover a path</p>
<p>from one location to another location</p>
<p>in a space of mathematics.</p>
<p>And if you can get to these intermediate results,</p>
<p>then you know your map is pretty good,</p>
<p>and you know you&rsquo;re using the right operations.</p>
<p>Much of what we think about is solving hard problems</p>
<p>is designing the correct reference frame for that problem,</p>
<p>figuring out how to organize the information</p>
<p>and what behaviors I wanna use in that space</p>
<p>to get me there.</p>
<p>Yeah, so if you dig in an idea of this reference frame,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s the math, you start a set of axioms</p>
<p>to try to get to proving the conjecture.</p>
<p>Can you try to describe, maybe take a step back,</p>
<p>how you think of the reference frame in that context?</p>
<p>Is it the reference frame that the axioms are happy in?</p>
<p>Is it the reference frame that might contain everything?</p>
<p>Is it a changing thing as you?</p>
<p>You have many, many reference frames.</p>
<p>I mean, in fact, the way the theory,</p>
<p>the thousand brain theory of intelligence says</p>
<p>that every single thing in the world</p>
<p>has its own reference frame.</p>
<p>So every word has its own reference frames.</p>
<p>And we can talk about this.</p>
<p>The mathematics work out,</p>
<p>this is no problem for neurons to do this.</p>
<p>But how many reference frames does a coffee cup have?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s on a table.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you ask how many reference frames</p>
<p>could a column in my finger</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s touching the coffee cup have?</p>
<p>Because there are many, many copy,</p>
<p>there are many, many models of the coffee cup.</p>
<p>So the coffee, there is no one model of a coffee cup.</p>
<p>There are many models of a coffee cup.</p>
<p>And you could say, well,</p>
<p>how many different things can my finger learn?</p>
<p>Is this the question you want to ask?</p>
<p>Imagine I say every concept, every idea,</p>
<p>everything you&rsquo;ve ever know about that you can say,</p>
<p>I know that thing has a reference frame</p>
<p>associated with it.</p>
<p>And what we do when we build composite objects,</p>
<p>we assign reference frames</p>
<p>to point another reference frame.</p>
<p>So my coffee cup has multiple components to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a limb, it&rsquo;s got a cylinder, it&rsquo;s got a handle.</p>
<p>And those things have their own reference frames</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re assigned to a master reference frame,</p>
<p>which is called this cup.</p>
<p>And now I have this Numenta logo on it.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s something that exists elsewhere in the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s its own thing.</p>
<p>So it has its own reference frame.</p>
<p>So we now have to say,</p>
<p>how can I assign the Numenta logo reference frame</p>
<p>onto the cylinder or onto the coffee cup?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all, we talked about this in the paper</p>
<p>that came out in December of this last year.</p>
<p>The idea of how you can assign reference frames</p>
<p>to reference frames, how neurons could do this.</p>
<p>So, well, my question is,</p>
<p>even though you mentioned reference frames a lot,</p>
<p>I almost feel it&rsquo;s really useful to dig into</p>
<p>how you think of what a reference frame is.</p>
<p>I mean, it was already helpful for me to understand</p>
<p>that you think of reference frames</p>
<p>as something there is a lot of.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s just say that we&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>some neurons in the brain, not many, actually,</p>
<p>10,000, 20,000 are gonna create</p>
<p>a whole bunch of reference frames.</p>
<p>What does it mean?</p>
<p>What is a reference frame?</p>
<p>First of all, these reference frames are different</p>
<p>than the ones you might be used to.</p>
<p>We know lots of reference frames.</p>
<p>For example, we know the Cartesian coordinates, X, Y, Z,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a type of reference frame.</p>
<p>We know longitude and latitude,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a different type of reference frame.</p>
<p>If I look at a printed map,</p>
<p>you might have columns A through M,</p>
<p>and rows one through 20,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a different type of reference frame.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a Cartesian coordinate reference frame.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about the reference frames</p>
<p>in the brain, and we know this because these</p>
<p>have been established through neuroscience</p>
<p>studying the entorhinal cortex.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not speculating here, okay?</p>
<p>This is known neuroscience in an old part of the brain.</p>
<p>The way these cells create reference frames,</p>
<p>they have no origin.</p>
<p>So what it&rsquo;s more like, you have a point,</p>
<p>a point in some space, and you,</p>
<p>given a particular movement,</p>
<p>you can then tell what the next point should be.</p>
<p>And you can then tell what the next point would be,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>You can use this to calculate</p>
<p>how to get from one point to another.</p>
<p>So how do I get from my house to my home,</p>
<p>or how do I get my finger from the side of my cup</p>
<p>to the top of the cup?</p>
<p>How do I get from the axioms to the conjecture?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a different type of reference frame,</p>
<p>and I can, if you want, I can describe in more detail,</p>
<p>I can paint a picture of how you might want</p>
<p>to think about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really helpful to think it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>you can move through, but is there,</p>
<p>is it helpful to think of it as spatial in some sense,</p>
<p>or is there something that&rsquo;s more?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s definitely spatial.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s spatial in a mathematical sense.</p>
<p>How many dimensions?</p>
<p>Can it be a crazy number of dimensions?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>In the old part of the brain, the entorhinal cortex,</p>
<p>they studied rats, and initially it looks like,</p>
<p>oh, this is just two dimensional.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the rat is in some box in the maze or whatever,</p>
<p>and they know where the rat is using</p>
<p>these two dimensional reference frames</p>
<p>to know where it is in the maze.</p>
<p>We said, well, okay, but what about bats?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a mammal, and they fly in three dimensional space.</p>
<p>How do they do that?</p>
<p>They seem to know where they are, right?</p>
<p>So this is a current area of active research,</p>
<p>and it seems like somehow the neurons</p>
<p>in the entorhinal cortex can learn three dimensional space.</p>
<p>We just, two members of our team,</p>
<p>along with Elif Fett from MIT,</p>
<p>just released a paper this literally last week.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on bioRxiv, where they show that you can,</p>
<p>if you, the way these things work,</p>
<p>and I won&rsquo;t get, unless you want to,</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t get into the detail,</p>
<p>but grid cells can represent any n dimensional space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not inherently limited.</p>
<p>You can think of it this way.</p>
<p>If you had two dimensional, the way it works</p>
<p>is you had a bunch of two dimensional slices.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way these things work.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole bunch of two dimensional models,</p>
<p>and you can just, you can slice up</p>
<p>any n dimensional space with two dimensional projections.</p>
<p>So, and you could have one dimensional models.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s nothing inherent about the mathematics</p>
<p>about the way the neurons do this,</p>
<p>which constrain the dimensionality of the space,</p>
<p>which I think was important.</p>
<p>So obviously I have a three dimensional map of this cup.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s even more than that, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s clearly a three dimensional map of the cup.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t just have a projection of the cup.</p>
<p>But when I think about birds,</p>
<p>or when I think about mathematics,</p>
<p>perhaps it&rsquo;s more than three dimensions.</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>So in terms of each individual column</p>
<p>building up more and more information over time,</p>
<p>do you think that mechanism is well understood?</p>
<p>In your mind, you&rsquo;ve proposed a lot of architectures there.</p>
<p>Is that a key piece, or is it,</p>
<p>is the big piece, the thousand brain theory of intelligence,</p>
<p>the ensemble of it all?</p>
<p>Well, I think they&rsquo;re both big.</p>
<p>I mean, clearly the concept, as a theorist,</p>
<p>the concept is most exciting, right?</p>
<p>The high level concept.</p>
<p>This is a totally new way of thinking</p>
<p>about how the neocortex works.</p>
<p>So that is appealing.</p>
<p>It has all these ramifications.</p>
<p>And with that, as a framework for how the brain works,</p>
<p>you can make all kinds of predictions</p>
<p>and solve all kinds of problems.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re trying to work through</p>
<p>many of these details right now.</p>
<p>Okay, how do the neurons actually do this?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out, if you think about grid cells</p>
<p>and place cells in the old parts of the brain,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot that&rsquo;s known about them,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s still some mysteries.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of debate about exactly the details,</p>
<p>how these work and what are the signs.</p>
<p>And we have that still, that same level of detail,</p>
<p>that same level of concern.</p>
<p>What we spend here most of our time doing</p>
<p>is trying to make a very good list</p>
<p>of the things we don&rsquo;t understand yet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the key part here.</p>
<p>What are the constraints?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like, oh, this thing seems to work, we&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s like, okay, it kind of works,</p>
<p>but these are other things we know it has to do</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not doing those yet.</p>
<p>I would say we&rsquo;re well on the way here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not done yet.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of trickiness to this system,</p>
<p>but the basic principles about how different layers</p>
<p>in the neocortex are doing much of this, we understand.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s some fundamental parts</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t understand as well.</p>
<p>So what would you say is one of the harder open problems</p>
<p>or one of the ones that have been bothering you,</p>
<p>keeping you up at night the most?</p>
<p>Oh, well, right now, this is a detailed thing</p>
<p>that wouldn&rsquo;t apply to most people, okay?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>But you want me to answer that question?</p>
<p>Yeah, please.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about as if, oh,</p>
<p>to predict what you&rsquo;re going to sense on this coffee cup,</p>
<p>I need to know where my finger is gonna be</p>
<p>on the coffee cup.</p>
<p>That is true, but it&rsquo;s insufficient.</p>
<p>Think about my finger touches the edge of the coffee cup.</p>
<p>My finger can touch it at different orientations.</p>
<p>I can rotate my finger around here and that doesn&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>I can make that prediction and somehow,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not just the location.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an orientation component of this as well.</p>
<p>This is known in the old parts of the brain too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s things called head direction cells,</p>
<p>which way the rat is facing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same kind of basic idea.</p>
<p>So if my finger were a rat, you know, in three dimensions,</p>
<p>I have a three dimensional orientation</p>
<p>and I have a three dimensional location.</p>
<p>If I was a rat, I would have a,</p>
<p>you might think of it as a two dimensional location,</p>
<p>a two dimensional orientation,</p>
<p>a one dimensional orientation,</p>
<p>like just which way is it facing?</p>
<p>So how the two components work together,</p>
<p>how it is that I combine orientation,</p>
<p>the orientation of my sensor,</p>
<p>as well as the location is a tricky problem.</p>
<p>And I think I&rsquo;ve made progress on it.</p>
<p>So at a bigger version of that,</p>
<p>so perspective is super interesting, but super specific.</p>
<p>Yeah, I warned you.</p>
<p>No, no, no, that&rsquo;s really good,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a more general version of that.</p>
<p>Do you think context matters,</p>
<p>the fact that we&rsquo;re in a building in North America,</p>
<p>that we, in the day and age where we have mugs?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s all this extra information</p>
<p>that you bring to the table about everything else</p>
<p>in the room that&rsquo;s outside of just the coffee cup.</p>
<p>How does it get connected, do you think?</p>
<p>Yeah, and that is another really interesting question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna throw that under the rubric</p>
<p>or the name of attentional problems.</p>
<p>First of all, we have this model,</p>
<p>I have many, many models.</p>
<p>And also the question, does it matter?</p>
<p>Well, it matters for certain things, of course it does.</p>
<p>Maybe what we think of that as a coffee cup</p>
<p>in another part of the world</p>
<p>is viewed as something completely different.</p>
<p>Or maybe our logo, which is very benign</p>
<p>in this part of the world,</p>
<p>it means something very different</p>
<p>in another part of the world.</p>
<p>So those things do matter.</p>
<p>I think the way to think about it is the following,</p>
<p>one way to think about it,</p>
<p>is we have all these models of the world, okay?</p>
<p>And we model everything.</p>
<p>And as I said earlier, I kind of snuck it in there,</p>
<p>our models are actually, we build composite structure.</p>
<p>So every object is composed of other objects,</p>
<p>which are composed of other objects,</p>
<p>and they become members of other objects.</p>
<p>So this room has chairs and a table and a room</p>
<p>and walls and so on.</p>
<p>Now we can just arrange these things in a certain way</p>
<p>and go, oh, that&rsquo;s the nomenclature conference room.</p>
<p>So, and what we do is when we go around the world</p>
<p>and we experience the world,</p>
<p>by walking into a room, for example,</p>
<p>the first thing I do is I can say,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m in this room, do I recognize the room?</p>
<p>Then I can say, oh, look, there&rsquo;s a table here.</p>
<p>And by attending to the table,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m then assigning this table in the context of the room.</p>
<p>Then I can say, oh, on the table, there&rsquo;s a coffee cup.</p>
<p>Oh, and on the table, there&rsquo;s a logo.</p>
<p>And in the logo, there&rsquo;s the word Nementa.</p>
<p>Oh, and look in the logo, there&rsquo;s the letter E.</p>
<p>Oh, and look, it has an unusual serif.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t actually, but I pretended to serif.</p>
<p>So the point is your attention is kind of drilling</p>
<p>deep in and out of these nested structures.</p>
<p>And I can pop back up and I can pop back down.</p>
<p>I can pop back up and I can pop back down.</p>
<p>So when I attend to the coffee cup,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t lost the context of everything else,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s sort of, there&rsquo;s this sort of nested structure.</p>
<p>So the attention filters the reference frame information</p>
<p>for that particular period of time?</p>
<p>Yes, it basically, moment to moment,</p>
<p>you attend the sub components,</p>
<p>and then you can attend the sub components</p>
<p>to sub components.</p>
<p>And you can move up and down.</p>
<p>You can move up and down.</p>
<p>We do that all the time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not even, now that I&rsquo;m aware of it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very conscious of it.</p>
<p>But until, but most people don&rsquo;t even think about this.</p>
<p>You just walk in a room and you don&rsquo;t say,</p>
<p>oh, I looked at the chair and I looked at the board</p>
<p>and looked at that word on the board</p>
<p>and I looked over here, what&rsquo;s going on, right?</p>
<p>So what percent of your day are you deeply aware of this?</p>
<p>And what part can you actually relax and just be Jeff?</p>
<p>Me personally, like my personal day?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m afflicted with too much of the former.</p>
<p>Well, unfortunately or unfortunately.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s useful?</p>
<p>Oh, it is useful, totally useful.</p>
<p>I think about this stuff almost all the time.</p>
<p>And one of my primary ways of thinking</p>
<p>is when I&rsquo;m in sleep at night,</p>
<p>I always wake up in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>And then I stay awake for at least an hour</p>
<p>with my eyes shut in sort of a half sleep state</p>
<p>thinking about these things.</p>
<p>I come up with answers to problems very often</p>
<p>in that sort of half sleeping state.</p>
<p>I think about it on my bike ride, I think about it on walks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just constantly thinking about this.</p>
<p>I have to almost schedule time</p>
<p>to not think about this stuff</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very, it&rsquo;s mentally taxing.</p>
<p>Are you, when you&rsquo;re thinking about this stuff,</p>
<p>are you thinking introspectively,</p>
<p>like almost taking a step outside of yourself</p>
<p>and trying to figure out what is your mind doing right now?</p>
<p>I do that all the time, but that&rsquo;s not all I do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m constantly observing myself.</p>
<p>So as soon as I started thinking about grid cells,</p>
<p>for example, and getting into that,</p>
<p>I started saying, oh, well, grid cells</p>
<p>can have my place of sense in the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where you know where you are.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting, we always have a sense</p>
<p>of where we are unless we&rsquo;re lost.</p>
<p>And so I started at night when I got up</p>
<p>to go to the bathroom, I would start trying to do it</p>
<p>completely with my eyes closed all the time.</p>
<p>And I would test my sense of grid cells.</p>
<p>I would walk five feet and say, okay, I think I&rsquo;m here.</p>
<p>Am I really there?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s my error?</p>
<p>And then I would calculate my error again</p>
<p>and see how the errors could accumulate.</p>
<p>So even something as simple as getting up</p>
<p>in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m testing these theories out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of fun.</p>
<p>I mean, the coffee cup is an example of that too.</p>
<p>So I find that these sort of everyday introspections</p>
<p>are actually quite helpful.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean you can ignore the science.</p>
<p>I mean, I spend hours every day</p>
<p>reading ridiculously complex papers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not nearly as much fun,</p>
<p>but you have to sort of build up those constraints</p>
<p>and the knowledge about the field and who&rsquo;s doing what</p>
<p>and what exactly they think is happening here.</p>
<p>And then you can sit back and say,</p>
<p>okay, let&rsquo;s try to piece this all together.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s come up with some, I&rsquo;m very,</p>
<p>in this group here, people, they know they do,</p>
<p>I do this all the time.</p>
<p>I come in with these introspective ideas and say,</p>
<p>well, have you ever thought about this?</p>
<p>Now watch, well, let&rsquo;s all do this together.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s helpful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, as long as you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>all you did was that, then you&rsquo;re just making up stuff.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re constraining it by the reality</p>
<p>of the neuroscience, then it&rsquo;s really helpful.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk a little bit about deep learning</p>
<p>and the successes in the applied space of neural networks,</p>
<p>ideas of training model on data</p>
<p>and these simple computational units,</p>
<p>artificial neurons that with backpropagation,</p>
<p>statistical ways of being able to generalize</p>
<p>from the training set onto data</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s similar to that training set.</p>
<p>So where do you think are the limitations</p>
<p>of those approaches?</p>
<p>What do you think are its strengths</p>
<p>relative to your major efforts</p>
<p>of constructing a theory of human intelligence?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not an expert in this field.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m somewhat knowledgeable.</p>
<p>So, but I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>Some of it is in just your intuition.</p>
<p>What are your?</p>
<p>Well, I have a little bit more than intuition,</p>
<p>but I just want to say like,</p>
<p>you know, one of the things that you asked me,</p>
<p>do I spend all my time thinking about neuroscience?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s to the exclusion of thinking about things</p>
<p>like convolutional neural networks.</p>
<p>But I try to stay current.</p>
<p>So look, I think it&rsquo;s great, the progress they&rsquo;ve made.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very highly useful for many things.</p>
<p>The models that we have today are actually derived</p>
<p>from a lot of neuroscience principles.</p>
<p>There are distributed processing systems</p>
<p>and distributed memory systems,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how the brain works.</p>
<p>They use things that we might call them neurons,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re really not neurons at all.</p>
<p>So we can just, they&rsquo;re not really neurons.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re distributed processing systems.</p>
<p>And that nature of hierarchy,</p>
<p>that came also from neuroscience.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a lot of things,</p>
<p>the learning rules, basically,</p>
<p>not back prop, but other, you know,</p>
<p>sort of heavy on top of that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be curious to say they&rsquo;re not neurons at all.</p>
<p>Can you describe in which way?</p>
<p>I mean, some of it is obvious,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d be curious if you have specific ways</p>
<p>in which you think are the biggest differences.</p>
<p>Yeah, we had a paper in 2016 called</p>
<p>Why Neurons Have Thousands of Synapses.</p>
<p>And if you read that paper,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll know what I&rsquo;m talking about here.</p>
<p>A real neuron in the brain is a complex thing.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s just start with the synapses on it,</p>
<p>which is a connection between neurons.</p>
<p>Real neurons can have everywhere</p>
<p>from five to 30,000 synapses on them.</p>
<p>The ones near the cell body,</p>
<p>the ones that are close to the soma of the cell body,</p>
<p>those are like the ones that people model</p>
<p>in artificial neurons.</p>
<p>There is a few hundred of those.</p>
<p>Maybe they can affect the cell.</p>
<p>They can make the cell become active.</p>
<p>95% of the synapses can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re too far away.</p>
<p>So if you activate one of those synapses,</p>
<p>it just doesn&rsquo;t affect the cell body enough</p>
<p>to make any difference.</p>
<p>Any one of them individually.</p>
<p>Any one of them individually,</p>
<p>or even if you do a mass of them.</p>
<p>What real neurons do is the following.</p>
<p>If you activate or you get 10 to 20 of them</p>
<p>active at the same time,</p>
<p>meaning they&rsquo;re all receiving an input at the same time,</p>
<p>and those 10 to 20 synapses or 40 synapses</p>
<p>within a very short distance on the dendrite,</p>
<p>like 40 microns, a very small area.</p>
<p>So if you activate a bunch of these</p>
<p>right next to each other at some distant place,</p>
<p>what happens is it creates</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called the dendritic spike.</p>
<p>And the dendritic spike travels through the dendrites</p>
<p>and can reach the soma or the cell body.</p>
<p>Now, when it gets there, it changes the voltage,</p>
<p>which is sort of like gonna make the cell fire,</p>
<p>but never enough to make the cell fire.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of what we call, it says we depolarize the cell,</p>
<p>you raise the voltage a little bit,</p>
<p>but not enough to do anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, what good is that?</p>
<p>And then it goes back down again.</p>
<p>So we propose a theory,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m very confident in basics are,</p>
<p>is that what&rsquo;s happening there is</p>
<p>those 95% of the synapses are recognizing</p>
<p>dozens to hundreds of unique patterns.</p>
<p>They can write about 10, 20 synapses at a time,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re acting like predictions.</p>
<p>So the neuron actually is a predictive engine on its own.</p>
<p>It can fire when it gets enough,</p>
<p>what they call proximal input</p>
<p>from those ones near the cell fire,</p>
<p>but it can get ready to fire from dozens to hundreds</p>
<p>of patterns that it recognizes from the other guys.</p>
<p>And the advantage of this to the neuron</p>
<p>is that when it actually does produce a spike</p>
<p>in action potential,</p>
<p>it does so slightly sooner than it would have otherwise.</p>
<p>And so what could is slightly sooner?</p>
<p>Well, the slightly sooner part is it,</p>
<p>all the excitatory neurons in the brain</p>
<p>are surrounded by these inhibitory neurons,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re very fast, the inhibitory neurons,</p>
<p>these basket cells.</p>
<p>And if I get my spike out</p>
<p>a little bit sooner than someone else,</p>
<p>I inhibit all my neighbors around me, right?</p>
<p>And what you end up with is a different representation.</p>
<p>You end up with a reputation that matches your prediction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sparser representation,</p>
<p>meaning fewer neurons are active,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s much more specific.</p>
<p>And so we showed how networks of these neurons</p>
<p>can do very sophisticated temporal prediction, basically.</p>
<p>So this, summarize this,</p>
<p>real neurons in the brain are time based prediction engines,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no concept of this at all</p>
<p>in artificial, what we call point neurons.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you can build a brain without them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you can build intelligence without them,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s where a large part of the time comes from.</p>
<p>These are predictive models, and the time is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a prior and a prediction and an action,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s inherent through every neuron in the neocortex.</p>
<p>So I would say that point neurons sort of model</p>
<p>a piece of that, and not very well at that either.</p>
<p>But like for example, synapses are very unreliable,</p>
<p>and you cannot assign any precision to them.</p>
<p>So even one digit of precision is not possible.</p>
<p>So the way real neurons work is they don&rsquo;t add these,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t change these weights accurately</p>
<p>like artificial neural networks do.</p>
<p>They basically form new synapses,</p>
<p>and so what you&rsquo;re trying to always do is</p>
<p>detect the presence of some 10 to 20</p>
<p>active synapses at the same time,</p>
<p>as opposed, and they&rsquo;re almost binary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, because you can&rsquo;t really represent</p>
<p>anything much finer than that.</p>
<p>So these are the kind of,</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s actually another essential component,</p>
<p>because the brain works on sparse patterns,</p>
<p>and all that mechanism is based on sparse patterns,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t actually think you could build real brains</p>
<p>or machine intelligence without</p>
<p>incorporating some of those ideas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to even think about the complexity</p>
<p>that emerges from the fact that</p>
<p>the timing of the firing matters in the brain,</p>
<p>the fact that you form new synapses,</p>
<p>and I mean, everything you just mentioned</p>
<p>in the past couple minutes.</p>
<p>Trust me, if you spend time on it,</p>
<p>you can get your mind around it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like, it&rsquo;s no longer a mystery to me.</p>
<p>No, but sorry, as a function, in a mathematical way,</p>
<p>can you start getting an intuition about</p>
<p>what gets it excited, what not,</p>
<p>and what kind of representation?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not as easy as,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s many other types of neural networks</p>
<p>that are more amenable to pure analysis,</p>
<p>especially very simple networks.</p>
<p>Oh, I have four neurons, and they&rsquo;re doing this.</p>
<p>Can we describe to them mathematically</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re doing type of thing?</p>
<p>Even the complexity of convolutional neural networks today,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of a mystery.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t really describe the whole system.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>My colleague Subitai Ahmad, he did a nice paper on this.</p>
<p>You can get all this stuff on our website</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested,</p>
<p>talking about sort of the mathematical properties</p>
<p>of sparse representations.</p>
<p>And so what we can do is we can show mathematically,</p>
<p>for example, why 10 to 20 synapses to recognize a pattern</p>
<p>is the correct number, is the right number you&rsquo;d wanna use.</p>
<p>And by the way, that matches biology.</p>
<p>We can show mathematically some of these concepts</p>
<p>about the show why the brain is so robust</p>
<p>to noise and error and fallout and so on.</p>
<p>We can show that mathematically</p>
<p>as well as empirically in simulations.</p>
<p>But the system can&rsquo;t be analyzed completely.</p>
<p>Any complex system can&rsquo;t, and so that&rsquo;s out of the realm.</p>
<p>But there is mathematical benefits and intuitions</p>
<p>that can be derived from mathematics.</p>
<p>And we try to do that as well.</p>
<p>Most of our papers have a section about that.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s refreshing and useful for me</p>
<p>to be talking to you about deep neural networks,</p>
<p>because your intuition basically says</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t achieve anything like intelligence</p>
<p>with artificial neural networks.</p>
<p>Well, not in the current form.</p>
<p>Not in the current form.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure we can do it in the ultimate form, sure.</p>
<p>So let me dig into it</p>
<p>and see what your thoughts are there a little bit.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure if you read this little blog post</p>
<p>called Bitter Lesson by Rich Sutton recently.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a reinforcement learning pioneer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;re familiar with him.</p>
<p>His basic idea is that all the stuff we&rsquo;ve done in AI</p>
<p>in the past 70 years, he&rsquo;s one of the old school guys.</p>
<p>The biggest lesson learned is that all the tricky things</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve done, they benefit in the short term,</p>
<p>but in the long term, what wins out</p>
<p>is a simple general method that just relies on Moore&rsquo;s law,</p>
<p>on computation getting faster and faster.</p>
<p>This is what he&rsquo;s saying.</p>
<p>This is what has worked up to now.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to build a system,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not concerned about intelligence.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s concerned about a system that works</p>
<p>in terms of making predictions</p>
<p>on applied narrow AI problems, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what this discussion is about.</p>
<p>That you just try to go as general as possible</p>
<p>and wait years or decades for the computation</p>
<p>to make it actually.</p>
<p>Is he saying that as a criticism</p>
<p>or is he saying this is a prescription</p>
<p>of what we ought to be doing?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s saying this is what has worked</p>
<p>and yes, a prescription, but it&rsquo;s a difficult prescription</p>
<p>because it says all the fun things</p>
<p>you guys are trying to do, we are trying to do.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s part of the community.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s saying it&rsquo;s only going to be short term gains.</p>
<p>So this all leads up to a question, I guess,</p>
<p>on artificial neural networks</p>
<p>and maybe our own biological neural networks</p>
<p>is do you think if we just scale things up significantly,</p>
<p>so take these dumb artificial neurons,</p>
<p>the point neurons, I like that term.</p>
<p>If we just have a lot more of them,</p>
<p>do you think some of the elements</p>
<p>that we see in the brain may start emerging?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>We can do bigger problems of the same type.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s been pointed out by many people</p>
<p>that today&rsquo;s convolutional neural networks</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t really much different</p>
<p>than the ones we had quite a while ago.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re bigger and train more</p>
<p>and we have more labeled data and so on.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think you can get to the kind of things</p>
<p>I know the brain can do and that we think about</p>
<p>as intelligence by just scaling it up.</p>
<p>So that may be, it&rsquo;s a good description</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s happened in the past,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happened recently with the reemergence</p>
<p>of artificial neural networks.</p>
<p>It may be a good prescription</p>
<p>for what&rsquo;s gonna happen in the short term.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the path.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said that earlier.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an alternate path.</p>
<p>I should mention to you, by the way,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve made sufficient progress</p>
<p>on the whole cortical theory in the last few years</p>
<p>that last year we decided to start actively pursuing</p>
<p>how do we get these ideas embedded into machine learning?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s, again, being led by my colleague,</p>
<p>Subed Tariman, and he&rsquo;s more of a machine learning guy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more of a neuroscience guy.</p>
<p>So this is now, I wouldn&rsquo;t say our focus,</p>
<p>but it is now an equal focus here</p>
<p>because we need to proselytize what we&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>and we need to show how it&rsquo;s beneficial</p>
<p>to the machine learning layer.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re putting, we have a plan in place right now.</p>
<p>In fact, we just did our first paper on this.</p>
<p>I can tell you about that.</p>
<p>But one of the reasons I wanna talk to you</p>
<p>is because I&rsquo;m trying to get more people</p>
<p>in the machine learning community to say,</p>
<p>I need to learn about this stuff.</p>
<p>And maybe we should just think about this a bit more</p>
<p>about what we&rsquo;ve learned about the brain</p>
<p>and what are those team at Nimenta, what have they done?</p>
<p>Is that useful for us?</p>
<p>Yeah, so is there elements of all the cortical theory</p>
<p>that things we&rsquo;ve been talking about</p>
<p>that may be useful in the short term?</p>
<p>Yes, in the short term, yes.</p>
<p>This is the, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>but the open question is,</p>
<p>it certainly feels from my perspective</p>
<p>that in the long term,</p>
<p>some of the ideas we&rsquo;ve been talking about</p>
<p>will be extremely useful.</p>
<p>The question is whether in the short term.</p>
<p>Well, this is always what I would call</p>
<p>the entrepreneur&rsquo;s dilemma.</p>
<p>So you have this long term vision,</p>
<p>oh, we&rsquo;re gonna all be driving electric cars</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re all gonna have computers</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re all gonna, whatever.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re at some point in time and you say,</p>
<p>I can see that long term vision,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>How do I get there without killing myself?</p>
<p>Without going out of business, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the challenge.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the dilemma.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the really difficult thing to do.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re facing that right now.</p>
<p>So ideally what you&rsquo;d wanna do</p>
<p>is find some steps along the way</p>
<p>that you can get there incrementally.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to like throw it all out</p>
<p>and start over again.</p>
<p>The first thing that we&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>is we focus on the sparse representations.</p>
<p>So just in case you don&rsquo;t know what that means</p>
<p>or some of the listeners don&rsquo;t know what that means,</p>
<p>in the brain, if I have like 10,000 neurons,</p>
<p>what you would see is maybe 2% of them active at a time.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see 50%, you don&rsquo;t see 30%,</p>
<p>you might see 2%.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s always like that.</p>
<p>For any set of sensory inputs?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if anything,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter any part of the brain.</p>
<p>But which neurons differs?</p>
<p>Which neurons are active?</p>
<p>Yeah, so let&rsquo;s say I take 10,000 neurons</p>
<p>that are representing something.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sitting there in a little block together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a teeny little block of neurons, 10,000 neurons.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re representing a location,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re representing a cup,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re representing the input from my sensors.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s representing something.</p>
<p>The way the representations occur,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always a sparse representation.</p>
<p>Meaning it&rsquo;s a population code.</p>
<p>So which 200 cells are active tells me what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, individual cells aren&rsquo;t that important at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the population code that matters.</p>
<p>And when you have sparse population codes,</p>
<p>then all kinds of beautiful properties come out of them.</p>
<p>So the brain uses sparse population codes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve written and described these benefits</p>
<p>in some of our papers.</p>
<p>So they give this tremendous robustness to the systems.</p>
<p>Brains are incredibly robust.</p>
<p>Neurons are dying all the time and spasming</p>
<p>and synapses are falling apart all the time.</p>
<p>And it keeps working.</p>
<p>So what Sibutai and Louise, one of our other engineers here</p>
<p>have done, have shown they&rsquo;re introducing sparseness</p>
<p>into convolutional neural networks.</p>
<p>Now other people are thinking along these lines,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re going about it in a more principled way, I think.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re showing that if you enforce sparseness</p>
<p>throughout these convolutional neural networks</p>
<p>in both the act, which sort of,</p>
<p>which neurons are active and the connections between them,</p>
<p>that you get some very desirable properties.</p>
<p>So one of the current hot topics in deep learning right now</p>
<p>are these adversarial examples.</p>
<p>So, you know, you give me any deep learning network</p>
<p>and I can give you a picture that looks perfect</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to call it, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to say the monkey is, you know, an airplane.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>And DARPA just announced some big thing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to, you know, have some contest for this.</p>
<p>But if you enforce sparse representations here,</p>
<p>many of these problems go away.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re much more robust and they&rsquo;re not easy to fool.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve already shown some of those results,</p>
<p>just literally in January or February,</p>
<p>just like last month we did that.</p>
<p>And you can, I think it&rsquo;s on bioRxiv right now,</p>
<p>or on iRxiv, you can read about it.</p>
<p>But, so that&rsquo;s like a baby step, okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s taking something from the brain.</p>
<p>We know about sparseness.</p>
<p>We know why it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>We know what it gives the brain.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s try to enforce that onto this.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your intuition why sparsity leads to robustness?</p>
<p>Because it feels like it would be less robust.</p>
<p>Why would you feel the rest robust to you?</p>
<p>So it just feels like if the fewer neurons are involved,</p>
<p>the more fragile the representation.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t say there was lots of few neurons.</p>
<p>I said, let&rsquo;s say 200.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a lot, it&rsquo;s just.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s an intuition for it.</p>
<p>This is a bit technical, so for engineers,</p>
<p>machine learning people, this will be easy,</p>
<p>but all the listeners, maybe not.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to classify something,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to divide some very high dimensional space</p>
<p>into different pieces, A and B.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re trying to create some point where you say,</p>
<p>all these points in this high dimensional space are A,</p>
<p>and all these points in this high dimensional space are B.</p>
<p>And if you have points that are close to that line,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not very robust.</p>
<p>It works for all the points you know about,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not very robust,</p>
<p>because you can just move a little bit</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve crossed over the line.</p>
<p>When you have sparse representations,</p>
<p>imagine I pick, I&rsquo;m gonna pick 200 cells active</p>
<p>out of 10,000, okay?</p>
<p>So I have 200 cells active.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s say I pick randomly another,</p>
<p>a different representation, 200.</p>
<p>The overlap between those is gonna be very small,</p>
<p>just a few.</p>
<p>I can pick millions of samples randomly of 200 neurons,</p>
<p>and not one of them will overlap more than just a few.</p>
<p>So one way to think about it is,</p>
<p>if I wanna fool one of these representations</p>
<p>to look like one of those other representations,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t move just one cell, or two cells,</p>
<p>or three cells, or four cells.</p>
<p>I have to move 100 cells.</p>
<p>And that makes them robust.</p>
<p>In terms of further, so you mentioned sparsity.</p>
<p>What would be the next thing?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so we have, we picked one.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s gonna work well yet.</p>
<p>So again, we&rsquo;re trying to come up with incremental ways</p>
<p>to moving from brain theory to add pieces</p>
<p>to machine learning, current machine learning world,</p>
<p>and one step at a time.</p>
<p>So the next thing we&rsquo;re gonna try to do</p>
<p>is sort of incorporate some of the ideas</p>
<p>of the thousand brains theory,</p>
<p>that you have many, many models that are voting.</p>
<p>Now that idea is not new.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a mixture of models that&rsquo;s been around</p>
<p>for a long time.</p>
<p>But the way the brain does it is a little different.</p>
<p>And the way it votes is different.</p>
<p>And the kind of way it represents uncertainty</p>
<p>is different.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re just starting this work,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re gonna try to see if we can sort of incorporate</p>
<p>some of the principles of voting,</p>
<p>or principles of the thousand brain theory.</p>
<p>Like lots of simple models that talk to each other</p>
<p>in a certain way.</p>
<p>And can we build more machines, systems that learn faster</p>
<p>and also, well mostly are multimodal</p>
<p>and robust to multimodal type of issues.</p>
<p>So one of the challenges there</p>
<p>is the machine learning computer vision community</p>
<p>has certain sets of benchmarks,</p>
<p>sets of tests based on which they compete.</p>
<p>And I would argue, especially from your perspective,</p>
<p>that those benchmarks aren&rsquo;t that useful</p>
<p>for testing the aspects that the brain is good at,</p>
<p>or intelligence.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not really testing intelligence.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very fine.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been extremely useful</p>
<p>for developing specific mathematical models,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not useful in the long term</p>
<p>for creating intelligence.</p>
<p>So you think you also have a role in proposing</p>
<p>better tests?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is a very,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve identified a very serious problem.</p>
<p>First of all, the tests that they have</p>
<p>are the tests that they want.</p>
<p>Not the tests of the other things</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re trying to do, right?</p>
<p>You know, what are the, so on.</p>
<p>The second thing is sometimes these,</p>
<p>to be competitive in these tests,</p>
<p>you have to have huge data sets and huge computing power.</p>
<p>And so, you know, and we don&rsquo;t have that here.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have it as well as other big teams</p>
<p>that big companies do.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s numerous issues there.</p>
<p>You know, we come out, you know,</p>
<p>where our approach to this is all based on,</p>
<p>in some sense, you might argue, elegance.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re coming at it from like a theoretical base</p>
<p>that we think, oh my God, this is so clearly elegant.</p>
<p>This is how brains work.</p>
<p>This is what intelligence is.</p>
<p>But the machine learning world has gotten in this phase</p>
<p>where they think it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter what you think,</p>
<p>as long as you do, you know, 0.1% better on this benchmark,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what, that&rsquo;s all that matters.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>You know, we have to figure out how to get around that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a challenge for us.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the challenges that we have to deal with.</p>
<p>So I agree, you&rsquo;ve identified a big issue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult for those reasons.</p>
<p>But you know, part of the reasons I&rsquo;m talking to you here</p>
<p>today is I hope I&rsquo;m gonna get some machine learning people</p>
<p>to say, I&rsquo;m gonna read those papers.</p>
<p>Those might be some interesting ideas.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tired of doing this 0.1% improvement stuff, you know?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here as well,</p>
<p>because I think machine learning now as a community</p>
<p>is at a place where the next step needs to be orthogonal</p>
<p>to what has received success in the past.</p>
<p>Well, you see other leaders saying this,</p>
<p>machine learning leaders, you know,</p>
<p>Jeff Hinton with his capsules idea.</p>
<p>Many people have gotten up to say, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna hit road map, maybe we should look at the brain,</p>
<p>you know, things like that.</p>
<p>So hopefully that thinking will occur organically.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re in a nice position for people to come</p>
<p>and look at our work and say,</p>
<p>well, what can we learn from these guys?</p>
<p>Yeah, MIT is launching a billion dollar computing college</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s centered around this idea, so.</p>
<p>Is it on this idea of what?</p>
<p>Well, the idea that, you know,</p>
<p>the humanities, psychology, and neuroscience</p>
<p>have to work all together to get to build the S.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, Stanford just did</p>
<p>this Human Centered AI Center.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little disappointed in these initiatives</p>
<p>because, you know, they&rsquo;re focusing</p>
<p>on sort of the human side of it,</p>
<p>and it could very easily slip into</p>
<p>how humans interact with intelligent machines,</p>
<p>which is nothing wrong with that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not, that is orthogonal</p>
<p>to what we&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to say, like,</p>
<p>what is the essence of intelligence?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>In fact, I wanna build intelligent machines</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t emotional, that don&rsquo;t smile at you,</p>
<p>that, you know, that aren&rsquo;t trying to tuck you in at night.</p>
<p>Yeah, there is that pattern that you,</p>
<p>when you talk about understanding humans</p>
<p>is important for understanding intelligence,</p>
<p>that you start slipping into topics of ethics</p>
<p>or, yeah, like you said,</p>
<p>the interactive elements as opposed to,</p>
<p>no, no, no, we have to zoom in on the brain,</p>
<p>study what the human brain, the baby, the&hellip;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s study what a brain does.</p>
<p>Does.</p>
<p>And then we can decide which parts of that</p>
<p>we wanna recreate in some system,</p>
<p>but until you have that theory about what the brain does,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the point, you know, it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be wasting time, I think.</p>
<p>Right, just to break it down</p>
<p>on the artificial neural network side,</p>
<p>maybe you could speak to this</p>
<p>on the biological neural network side,</p>
<p>the process of learning versus the process of inference.</p>
<p>Maybe you can explain to me,</p>
<p>is there a difference between,</p>
<p>you know, in artificial neural networks,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a difference between the learning stage</p>
<p>and the inference stage.</p>
<p>Do you see the brain as something different?</p>
<p>One of the big distinctions that people often say,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how correct it is,</p>
<p>is artificial neural networks need a lot of data.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very inefficient learning.</p>
<p>Do you see that as a correct distinction</p>
<p>from the biology of the human brain,</p>
<p>that the human brain is very efficient,</p>
<p>or is that just something we deceive ourselves?</p>
<p>No, it is efficient, obviously.</p>
<p>We can learn new things almost instantly.</p>
<p>And so what elements do you think are useful?</p>
<p>Yeah, I can talk about that.</p>
<p>You brought up two issues there.</p>
<p>So remember I talked early about the constraints</p>
<p>we always feel, well, one of those constraints</p>
<p>is the fact that brains are continually learning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not something we said, oh, we can add that later.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that was upfront,</p>
<p>had to be there from the start,</p>
<p>made our problems harder.</p>
<p>But we showed, going back to the 2016 paper</p>
<p>on sequence memory, we showed how that happens,</p>
<p>how the brains infer and learn at the same time.</p>
<p>And our models do that.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not two separate phases,</p>
<p>or two separate sets of time.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a big, big problem in AI,</p>
<p>at least for many applications, not for all.</p>
<p>So I can talk about that.</p>
<p>There are some, it gets detailed,</p>
<p>there are some parts of the neocortex in the brain</p>
<p>where actually what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s these cycles of activity in the brain.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s very strong evidence</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re doing more of inference</p>
<p>on one part of the phase,</p>
<p>and more of learning on the other part of the phase.</p>
<p>So the brain can actually sort of separate</p>
<p>different populations of cells</p>
<p>or going back and forth like this.</p>
<p>But in general, I would say that&rsquo;s an important problem.</p>
<p>We have all of our networks that we&rsquo;ve come up with do both.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re continuous learning networks.</p>
<p>And you mentioned benchmarks earlier.</p>
<p>Well, there are no benchmarks about that.</p>
<p>So we have to, we get in our little soapbox,</p>
<p>and hey, by the way, this is important,</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s a mechanism for doing that.</p>
<p>But until you can prove it to someone</p>
<p>in some commercial system or something, it&rsquo;s a little harder.</p>
<p>So yeah, one of the things I had to linger on that</p>
<p>is in some ways to learn the concept of a coffee cup,</p>
<p>you only need this one coffee cup</p>
<p>and maybe some time alone in a room with it.</p>
<p>Well, the first thing is,</p>
<p>imagine I reach my hand into a black box</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m reaching, I&rsquo;m trying to touch something.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know upfront if it&rsquo;s something I already know</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s a new thing.</p>
<p>And I have to, I&rsquo;m doing both at the same time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say, oh, let&rsquo;s see if it&rsquo;s a new thing.</p>
<p>Oh, let&rsquo;s see if it&rsquo;s an old thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>As I go, my brain says, oh, it&rsquo;s new or it&rsquo;s not new.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s new, I start learning what it is.</p>
<p>And by the way, it starts learning from the get go,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s gonna recognize it.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not separate problems.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the thing there.</p>
<p>The other thing you mentioned was the fast learning.</p>
<p>So I was just talking about continuous learning,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also fast learning.</p>
<p>Literally, I can show you this coffee cup</p>
<p>and I say, here&rsquo;s a new coffee cup.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got the logo on it.</p>
<p>Take a look at it, done, you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>You can predict what it&rsquo;s gonna look like,</p>
<p>you know, in different positions.</p>
<p>So I can talk about that too.</p>
<p>In the brain, the way learning occurs,</p>
<p>I mentioned this earlier, but I&rsquo;ll mention it again.</p>
<p>The way learning occurs,</p>
<p>imagine I am a section of a dendrite of a neuron,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna learn something new.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter what it is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna learn something new.</p>
<p>I need to recognize a new pattern.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m gonna do is I&rsquo;m gonna form new synapses.</p>
<p>New synapses, we&rsquo;re gonna rewire the brain</p>
<p>onto that section of the dendrite.</p>
<p>Once I&rsquo;ve done that, everything else that neuron has learned</p>
<p>is not affected by it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s isolated</p>
<p>to that small section of the dendrite.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not all being added together, like a point neuron.</p>
<p>So if I learn something new on this segment here,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t change any of the learning</p>
<p>that occur anywhere else in that neuron.</p>
<p>So I can add something without affecting previous learning.</p>
<p>And I can do it quickly.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk, we can talk about the quickness,</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s done in real neurons.</p>
<p>You might say, well, doesn&rsquo;t it take time to form synapses?</p>
<p>Yes, it can take maybe an hour to form a new synapse.</p>
<p>We can form memories quicker than that,</p>
<p>and I can explain that how it happens too, if you want.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s getting a bit neurosciencey.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great, but is there an understanding</p>
<p>of these mechanisms at every level?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So from the short term memories and the forming.</p>
<p>So this idea of synaptogenesis, the growth of new synapses,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s well described, it&rsquo;s well understood.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an essential part of learning.</p>
<p>That is learning.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Going back many, many years,</p>
<p>people, you know, it was, what&rsquo;s his name,</p>
<p>the psychologist who proposed, Hebb, Donald Hebb.</p>
<p>He proposed that learning was the modification</p>
<p>of the strength of a connection between two neurons.</p>
<p>People interpreted that as the modification</p>
<p>of the strength of a synapse.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t say that.</p>
<p>He just said there&rsquo;s a modification</p>
<p>between the effect of one neuron and another.</p>
<p>So synaptogenesis is totally consistent</p>
<p>with what Donald Hebb said.</p>
<p>But anyway, there&rsquo;s these mechanisms,</p>
<p>the growth of new synapses.</p>
<p>You can go online, you can watch a video</p>
<p>of a synapse growing in real time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally, you can see this little thing going boop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty impressive.</p>
<p>So those mechanisms are known.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s another thing that we&rsquo;ve speculated</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve written about,</p>
<p>which is consistent with known neuroscience,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s less proven.</p>
<p>And this is the idea, how do I form a memory</p>
<p>really, really quickly?</p>
<p>Like instantaneous.</p>
<p>If it takes an hour to grow a synapse,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s not instantaneous.</p>
<p>So there are types of synapses called silent synapses.</p>
<p>They look like a synapse, but they don&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just sitting there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if an action potential comes in,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t release any neurotransmitter.</p>
<p>Some parts of the brain have more of these than others.</p>
<p>For example, the hippocampus has a lot of them,</p>
<p>which is where we associate most short term memory with.</p>
<p>So what we speculated, again, in that 2016 paper,</p>
<p>we proposed that the way we form very quick memories,</p>
<p>very short term memories, or quick memories,</p>
<p>is that we convert silent synapses into active synapses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like saying a synapse has a zero weight</p>
<p>and a one weight,</p>
<p>but the longterm memory has to be formed by synaptogenesis.</p>
<p>So you can remember something really quickly</p>
<p>by just flipping a bunch of these guys from silent to active.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not from 0.1 to 0.15.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it doesn&rsquo;t do anything</p>
<p>till it releases transmitter.</p>
<p>And if I do that over a bunch of these,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a very quick short term memory.</p>
<p>So I guess the lesson behind this</p>
<p>is that most neural networks today are fully connected.</p>
<p>Every neuron connects every other neuron</p>
<p>from layer to layer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not correct in the brain.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>We actually don&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>You want a very sparse connectivity</p>
<p>so that any neuron connects to some subset of the neurons</p>
<p>in the other layer.</p>
<p>And it does so on a dendrite by dendrite segment basis.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very some parcelated out type of thing.</p>
<p>And that then learning is not adjusting all these weights,</p>
<p>but learning is just saying,</p>
<p>okay, connect to these 10 cells here right now.</p>
<p>In that process, you know, with artificial neural networks,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very simple process of backpropagation</p>
<p>that adjusts the weights.</p>
<p>The process of synaptogenesis.</p>
<p>Synaptogenesis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even easier.</p>
<p>Backpropagation requires something</p>
<p>that really can&rsquo;t happen in brains.</p>
<p>This backpropagation of this error signal,</p>
<p>that really can&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>People are trying to make it happen in brains,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t happen in brains.</p>
<p>This is pure Hebbian learning.</p>
<p>Well, synaptogenesis is pure Hebbian learning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically saying,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a population of cells over here</p>
<p>that are active right now.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a population of cells over here</p>
<p>active right now.</p>
<p>How do I form connections between those active cells?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s literally saying this guy became active.</p>
<p>These 100 neurons here became active</p>
<p>before this neuron became active.</p>
<p>So form connections to those ones.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no propagation of error, nothing.</p>
<p>All the networks we do,</p>
<p>all the models we have work on almost completely on</p>
<p>Hebbian learning,</p>
<p>but on dendritic segments</p>
<p>and multiple synapses at the same time.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s sort of turn the question</p>
<p>that you already answered,</p>
<p>and maybe you can answer it again.</p>
<p>If you look at the history of artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>where do you think we stand?</p>
<p>How far are we from solving intelligence?</p>
<p>You said you were very optimistic.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate on that?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s always the crazy question to ask</p>
<p>because no one can predict the future.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll tell you a story.</p>
<p>I used to run a different neuroscience institute</p>
<p>called the Redwood Neuroscience Institute,</p>
<p>and we would hold these symposiums</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d get like 35 scientists</p>
<p>from around the world to come together.</p>
<p>And I used to ask them all the same question.</p>
<p>I would say, well, how long do you think it&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>before we understand how the neocortex works?</p>
<p>And everyone went around the room</p>
<p>and they had introduced the name</p>
<p>and they have to answer that question.</p>
<p>So I got, the typical answer was 50 to 100 years.</p>
<p>Some people would say 500 years.</p>
<p>Some people said never.</p>
<p>I said, why are you a neuroscientist?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never gonna, it&rsquo;s a good pay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So, you know, but it doesn&rsquo;t work like that.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, these are not,</p>
<p>these are step functions.</p>
<p>Things happen and then bingo, they happen.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t predict that.</p>
<p>I feel I&rsquo;ve already passed a step function.</p>
<p>So if I can do my job correctly over the next five years,</p>
<p>then, meaning I can proselytize these ideas.</p>
<p>I can convince other people they&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>We can show that other people,</p>
<p>machine learning people should pay attention</p>
<p>to these ideas.</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;re definitely in an under 20 year timeframe.</p>
<p>If I can do those things, if I&rsquo;m not successful in that,</p>
<p>and this is the last time anyone talks to me</p>
<p>and no one reads our papers and you know,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m wrong or something like that,</p>
<p>then I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not 50 years.</p>
<p>Think about electric cars.</p>
<p>How quickly are they gonna populate the world?</p>
<p>It probably takes about a 20 year span.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be something like that.</p>
<p>But I think if I can do what I said, we&rsquo;re starting it.</p>
<p>And of course there could be other,</p>
<p>you said step functions.</p>
<p>It could be everybody gives up on your ideas for 20 years</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden somebody picks it up again.</p>
<p>Wait, that guy was onto something.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that would be a failure on my part, right?</p>
<p>Think about Charles Babbage.</p>
<p>Charles Babbage, he&rsquo;s the guy who invented the computer</p>
<p>back in the 18 something, 1800s.</p>
<p>And everyone forgot about it until 100 years later.</p>
<p>And say, hey, this guy figured this stuff out</p>
<p>a long time ago.</p>
<p>But he was ahead of his time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, as I said,</p>
<p>I recognize this is part of any entrepreneur&rsquo;s challenge.</p>
<p>I use entrepreneur broadly in this case.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not meaning like I&rsquo;m building a business</p>
<p>or trying to sell something.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m trying to sell ideas.</p>
<p>And this is the challenge as to how you get people</p>
<p>to pay attention to you, how do you get them</p>
<p>to give you positive or negative feedback,</p>
<p>how do you get the people to act differently</p>
<p>based on your ideas.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll see how well we do on that.</p>
<p>So you know that there&rsquo;s a lot of hype</p>
<p>behind artificial intelligence currently.</p>
<p>Do you, as you look to spread the ideas</p>
<p>that are of neocortical theory, the things you&rsquo;re working on,</p>
<p>do you think there&rsquo;s some possibility</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll hit an AI winter once again?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s certainly a possibility.</p>
<p>No question about it.</p>
<p>Is that something you worry about?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I guess, do I worry about it?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t decided yet if that&rsquo;s good or bad for my mission.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true, that&rsquo;s very true.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s almost like you need the winter</p>
<p>to refresh the palette.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like, I want, here&rsquo;s what you wanna have it is.</p>
<p>You want, like to the extent that everyone is so thrilled</p>
<p>about the current state of machine learning and AI</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t imagine they need anything else,</p>
<p>it makes my job harder.</p>
<p>If everything crashed completely</p>
<p>and every student left the field</p>
<p>and there was no money for anybody to do anything</p>
<p>and it became an embarrassment</p>
<p>to talk about machine intelligence and AI,</p>
<p>that wouldn&rsquo;t be good for us either.</p>
<p>You want sort of the soft landing approach, right?</p>
<p>You want enough people, the senior people in AI</p>
<p>and machine learning to say, you know,</p>
<p>we need other approaches.</p>
<p>We really need other approaches.</p>
<p>Damn, we need other approaches.</p>
<p>Maybe we should look to the brain.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s look to the brain.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s got some brain ideas?</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s start a little project on the side here</p>
<p>trying to do brain idea related stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the ideal outcome we would want.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want a total winter</p>
<p>and yet I don&rsquo;t want it to be sunny all the time either.</p>
<p>So what do you think it takes to build a system</p>
<p>with human level intelligence</p>
<p>where once demonstrated you would be very impressed?</p>
<p>So does it have to have a body?</p>
<p>Does it have to have the C word we used before,</p>
<p>consciousness as an entirety in a holistic sense?</p>
<p>First of all, I don&rsquo;t think the goal</p>
<p>is to create a machine that is human level intelligence.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a false goal.</p>
<p>Back to Turing, I think it was a false statement.</p>
<p>We want to understand what intelligence is</p>
<p>and then we can build intelligent machines</p>
<p>of all different scales, all different capabilities.</p>
<p>A dog is intelligent.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need, that&rsquo;d be pretty good to have a dog.</p>
<p>But what about something that doesn&rsquo;t look</p>
<p>like an animal at all, in different spaces?</p>
<p>So my thinking about this is that</p>
<p>we want to define what intelligence is,</p>
<p>agree upon what makes an intelligent system.</p>
<p>We can then say, okay, we&rsquo;re now gonna build systems</p>
<p>that work on those principles or some subset of them</p>
<p>and we can apply them to all different types of problems.</p>
<p>And the kind, the idea, it&rsquo;s not computing.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t ask, if I take a little one chip computer,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say, well, that&rsquo;s not a computer</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not as powerful as this big server over here.</p>
<p>No, no, because we know that what the principles</p>
<p>of computing are and I can apply those principles</p>
<p>to a small problem or into a big problem.</p>
<p>And same, intelligence needs to get there.</p>
<p>We have to say, these are the principles.</p>
<p>I can make a small one, a big one.</p>
<p>I can make them distributed.</p>
<p>I can put them on different sensors.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to be human like at all.</p>
<p>Now, you did bring up a very interesting question</p>
<p>about embodiment.</p>
<p>Does it have to have a body?</p>
<p>It has to have some concept of movement.</p>
<p>It has to be able to move through these reference frames</p>
<p>I talked about earlier.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s physically moving,</p>
<p>like I need, if I&rsquo;m gonna have an AI</p>
<p>that understands coffee cups,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna have to pick up the coffee cup</p>
<p>and touch it and look at it with its eyes and hands</p>
<p>or something equivalent to that.</p>
<p>If I have a mathematical AI,</p>
<p>maybe it needs to move through mathematical spaces.</p>
<p>I could have a virtual AI that lives in the internet</p>
<p>and its movements are traversing links</p>
<p>and digging into files,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s got a location that it&rsquo;s traveling</p>
<p>through some space.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have an AI that just take some flash thing input.</p>
<p>We call it flash inference.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a pattern, done.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s movement pattern, movement pattern,</p>
<p>movement pattern, attention, digging, building structure,</p>
<p>figuring out the model of the world.</p>
<p>So some sort of embodiment,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s physical or not, has to be part of it.</p>
<p>So self awareness and the way to be able to answer</p>
<p>where am I?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re bringing up self,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a different topic, self awareness.</p>
<p>No, the very narrow definition of self,</p>
<p>meaning knowing a sense of self enough to know</p>
<p>where am I in the space where it&rsquo;s actually.</p>
<p>Yeah, basically the system needs to know its location</p>
<p>or each component of the system needs to know</p>
<p>where it is in the world at that point in time.</p>
<p>So self awareness and consciousness.</p>
<p>Do you think one, from the perspective of neuroscience</p>
<p>and neurocortex, these are interesting topics,</p>
<p>solvable topics.</p>
<p>Do you have any ideas of why the heck it is</p>
<p>that we have a subjective experience at all?</p>
<p>Yeah, I have a lot of thoughts on that.</p>
<p>And is it useful or is it just a side effect of us?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to think about.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s useful as a means to figure out</p>
<p>how to build intelligent machines.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that systems do</p>
<p>and we can talk about what it is that are like,</p>
<p>well, if I build a system like this,</p>
<p>then it would be self aware.</p>
<p>Or if I build it like this, it wouldn&rsquo;t be self aware.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a choice I can have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like, oh my God, it&rsquo;s self aware.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t turn, I heard an interview recently</p>
<p>with this philosopher from Yale,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember his name, I apologize for that.</p>
<p>But he was talking about,</p>
<p>well, if these computers are self aware,</p>
<p>then it would be a crime to unplug them.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, oh, come on, that&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>I unplug myself every night, I go to sleep.</p>
<p>Is that a crime?</p>
<p>I plug myself in again in the morning and there I am.</p>
<p>So people get kind of bent out of shape about this.</p>
<p>I have very definite, very detailed understanding</p>
<p>or opinions about what it means to be conscious</p>
<p>and what it means to be self aware.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that interesting a problem.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked to Christoph Koch.</p>
<p>He thinks that&rsquo;s the only problem.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t actually listen to your interview with him,</p>
<p>but I know him and I know that&rsquo;s the thing he cares about.</p>
<p>He also thinks intelligence and consciousness are disjoint.</p>
<p>So I mean, it&rsquo;s not, you don&rsquo;t have to have one or the other.</p>
<p>So he is.</p>
<p>I disagree with that.</p>
<p>I just totally disagree with that.</p>
<p>So where&rsquo;s your thoughts and consciousness,</p>
<p>where does it emerge from?</p>
<p>Because it is.</p>
<p>So then we have to break it down to the two parts, okay?</p>
<p>Because consciousness isn&rsquo;t one thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of the problem with that term</p>
<p>is it means different things to different people</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s different components of it.</p>
<p>There is a concept of self awareness, okay?</p>
<p>That can be very easily explained.</p>
<p>You have a model of your own body.</p>
<p>The neocortex models things in the world</p>
<p>and it also models your own body.</p>
<p>And then it has a memory.</p>
<p>It can remember what you&rsquo;ve done, okay?</p>
<p>So it can remember what you did this morning,</p>
<p>can remember what you had for breakfast and so on.</p>
<p>And so I can say to you, okay, Lex,</p>
<p>were you conscious this morning when you had your bagel?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d say, yes, I was conscious.</p>
<p>Now what if I could take your brain</p>
<p>and revert all the synapses back</p>
<p>to the state they were this morning?</p>
<p>And then I said to you, Lex,</p>
<p>were you conscious when you ate the bagel?</p>
<p>And you said, no, I wasn&rsquo;t conscious.</p>
<p>I said, here&rsquo;s a video of eating the bagel.</p>
<p>And you said, I wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not possible</p>
<p>because I must&rsquo;ve been unconscious at that time.</p>
<p>So we can just make this one to one correlation</p>
<p>between memory of your body&rsquo;s trajectory through the world</p>
<p>over some period of time,</p>
<p>a memory and the ability to recall that memory</p>
<p>is what you would call conscious.</p>
<p>I was conscious of that, it&rsquo;s a self awareness.</p>
<p>And any system that can recall,</p>
<p>memorize what it&rsquo;s done recently</p>
<p>and bring that back and invoke it again</p>
<p>would say, yeah, I&rsquo;m aware.</p>
<p>I remember what I did.</p>
<p>All right, I got it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an easy one.</p>
<p>Although some people think that&rsquo;s a hard one.</p>
<p>The more challenging part of consciousness</p>
<p>is this one that&rsquo;s sometimes used</p>
<p>going by the word of qualia,</p>
<p>which is, why does an object seem red?</p>
<p>Or what is pain?</p>
<p>And why does pain feel like something?</p>
<p>Why do I feel redness?</p>
<p>Or why do I feel painness?</p>
<p>And then I could say, well,</p>
<p>why does sight seems different than hearing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, these are all just neurons.</p>
<p>And so how is it that,</p>
<p>why does looking at you feel different than hearing you?</p>
<p>It feels different, but there&rsquo;s just neurons in my head.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all doing the same thing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>The best treatise I&rsquo;ve read about this</p>
<p>is by a guy named Oregon.</p>
<p>He wrote a book called,</p>
<p>Why Red Doesn&rsquo;t Sound Like a Bell.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little, it&rsquo;s not a trade book, easy to read,</p>
<p>but it, and it&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>Take something like color.</p>
<p>Color really doesn&rsquo;t exist in the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a property of the world.</p>
<p>Property of the world that exists is light frequency.</p>
<p>And that gets turned into,</p>
<p>we have certain cells in the retina</p>
<p>that respond to different frequencies</p>
<p>different than others.</p>
<p>And so when they enter the brain,</p>
<p>you just have a bunch of axons</p>
<p>that are firing at different rates.</p>
<p>And from that, we perceive color.</p>
<p>But there is no color in the brain.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no color coming in on those synapses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a correlation between some axons</p>
<p>and some property of frequency.</p>
<p>And that isn&rsquo;t even color itself.</p>
<p>Frequency doesn&rsquo;t have a color.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just what it is.</p>
<p>So then the question is,</p>
<p>well, why does it even appear to have a color at all?</p>
<p>Just as you&rsquo;re describing it,</p>
<p>there seems to be a connection to those ideas</p>
<p>of reference frames.</p>
<p>I mean, it just feels like consciousness</p>
<p>having the subject,</p>
<p>assigning the feeling of red to the actual color</p>
<p>or to the wavelength is useful for intelligence.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s a good way of putting it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s useful as a predictive mechanism</p>
<p>or useful as a generalization idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a way of grouping things together to say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s useful to have a model like this.</p>
<p>So think about the well known syndrome</p>
<p>that people who&rsquo;ve lost a limb experience</p>
<p>called phantom limbs.</p>
<p>And what they claim is they can have their arm is removed,</p>
<p>but they feel their arm.</p>
<p>That not only feel it, they know it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s there, I know it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll swear to you that it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>And then they can feel pain in their arm</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll feel pain in their finger.</p>
<p>And if they move their non existent arm behind their back,</p>
<p>then they feel the pain behind their back.</p>
<p>So this whole idea that your arm exists</p>
<p>is a model of your brain.</p>
<p>It may or may not really exist.</p>
<p>And just like, but it&rsquo;s useful to have a model of something</p>
<p>that sort of correlates to things in the world.</p>
<p>So you can make predictions about what would happen</p>
<p>when those things occur.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit of a fuzzy,</p>
<p>but I think you&rsquo;re getting quite towards the answer there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s useful for the model to express things certain ways</p>
<p>that we can then map them into these reference frames</p>
<p>and make predictions about them.</p>
<p>I need to spend more time on this topic.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t bother me.</p>
<p>Do you really need to spend more time?</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>It does feel special that we have subjective experience,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m yet to know why.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just personally curious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not necessary for the work we&rsquo;re doing here.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I need to solve that problem</p>
<p>to build intelligent machines at all, not at all.</p>
<p>But there is sort of the silly notion</p>
<p>that you described briefly</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t seem so silly to us humans is,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re successful building intelligent machines,</p>
<p>it feels wrong to then turn them off.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re able to build a lot of them,</p>
<p>it feels wrong to then be able to turn off the&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, why?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s break that down a bit.</p>
<p>As humans, why do we fear death?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two reasons we fear death.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, I&rsquo;ll say,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re dead, it doesn&rsquo;t matter at all.</p>
<p>Who cares?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re dead.</p>
<p>So why do we fear death?</p>
<p>We fear death for two reasons.</p>
<p>One is because we are programmed genetically to fear death.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a survival and pop beginning of the genes thing.</p>
<p>And we also are programmed to feel sad</p>
<p>when people we know die.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t feel sad for someone we don&rsquo;t know dies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people dying right now,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re only just gonna say,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel bad about them,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know them.</p>
<p>But if I knew them, I&rsquo;d feel really bad.</p>
<p>So again, these are old brain,</p>
<p>genetically embedded things that we fear death.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s outside of those uncomfortable feelings.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing else to worry about.</p>
<p>Well, wait, hold on a second.</p>
<p>Do you know the denial of death by Becker?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a thought that death is,</p>
<p>our whole conception of our world model</p>
<p>kind of assumes immortality.</p>
<p>And then death is this terror that underlies it all.</p>
<p>So like&hellip;</p>
<p>Some people&rsquo;s world model, not mine.</p>
<p>But, okay, so what Becker would say</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re just living in an illusion.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve constructed an illusion for yourself</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such a terrible terror,</p>
<p>the fact that this&hellip;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the illusion?</p>
<p>The illusion that death doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still not coming to grips with&hellip;</p>
<p>The illusion of what?</p>
<p>That death is&hellip;</p>
<p>Going to happen.</p>
<p>Oh, like it&rsquo;s not gonna happen?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re actually operating.</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t, even though you said you&rsquo;ve accepted it,</p>
<p>you haven&rsquo;t really accepted the notion that you&rsquo;re gonna die</p>
<p>is what you say.</p>
<p>So it sounds like you disagree with that notion.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, totally.</p>
<p>I literally, every night I go to bed, it&rsquo;s like dying.</p>
<p>Like little deaths.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s little deaths.</p>
<p>And if I didn&rsquo;t wake up, it wouldn&rsquo;t matter to me.</p>
<p>Only if I knew that was gonna happen would it be bothersome.</p>
<p>If I didn&rsquo;t know it was gonna happen, how would I know?</p>
<p>Then I would worry about my wife.</p>
<p>So imagine I was a loner and I lived in Alaska</p>
<p>and I lived out there and there was no animals.</p>
<p>Nobody knew I existed.</p>
<p>I was just eating these roots all the time.</p>
<p>And nobody knew I was there.</p>
<p>And one day I didn&rsquo;t wake up.</p>
<p>What pain in the world would there exist?</p>
<p>Well, so most people that think about this problem</p>
<p>would say that you&rsquo;re just deeply enlightened</p>
<p>or are completely delusional.</p>
<p>One of the two.</p>
<p>But I would say that&rsquo;s a very enlightened way</p>
<p>to see the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the rational one as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rational, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But the fact is we don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I mean, we really don&rsquo;t have an understanding</p>
<p>of why the heck it is we&rsquo;re born and why we die</p>
<p>and what happens after we die.</p>
<p>Well, maybe there isn&rsquo;t a reason, maybe there is.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m interested in those big problems too, right?</p>
<p>You interviewed Max Tegmark,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s people like that, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in those big problems as well.</p>
<p>And in fact, when I was young,</p>
<p>I made a list of the biggest problems I could think of.</p>
<p>First, why does anything exist?</p>
<p>Second, why do we have the laws of physics that we have?</p>
<p>Third, is life inevitable?</p>
<p>And why is it here?</p>
<p>Fourth, is intelligence inevitable?</p>
<p>And why is it here?</p>
<p>I stopped there because I figured</p>
<p>if you can make a truly intelligent system,</p>
<p>that will be the quickest way</p>
<p>to answer the first three questions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m serious.</p>
<p>And so I said, my mission, you asked me earlier,</p>
<p>my first mission is to understand the brain,</p>
<p>but I felt that is the shortest way</p>
<p>to get to true machine intelligence.</p>
<p>And I wanna get to true machine intelligence</p>
<p>because even if it doesn&rsquo;t occur in my lifetime,</p>
<p>other people will benefit from it</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;ll occur in my lifetime,</p>
<p>but 20 years, you never know.</p>
<p>But that will be the quickest way for us to,</p>
<p>we can make super mathematicians,</p>
<p>we can make super space explorers,</p>
<p>we can make super physicist brains that do these things</p>
<p>and that can run experiments that we can&rsquo;t run.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have the abilities to manipulate things and so on,</p>
<p>but we can build intelligent machines that do all those things</p>
<p>with the ultimate goal of finding out the answers</p>
<p>to the other questions.</p>
<p>Let me ask you another depressing and difficult question,</p>
<p>which is once we achieve that goal of creating,</p>
<p>no, of understanding intelligence,</p>
<p>do you think we would be happier,</p>
<p>more fulfilled as a species?</p>
<p>The understanding intelligence</p>
<p>or understanding the answers to the big questions?</p>
<p>Understanding intelligence.</p>
<p>Oh, totally, totally.</p>
<p>It would be far more fun place to live.</p>
<p>You think so?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, why not?</p>
<p>I mean, just put aside this terminator nonsense</p>
<p>and just think about, you can think about,</p>
<p>we can talk about the risks of AI if you want.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to, so let&rsquo;s talk about.</p>
<p>But I think the world would be far better knowing things.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re always better than know things.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s better, is it a better place to live in</p>
<p>that I know that our planet is one of many</p>
<p>in the solar system and the solar system&rsquo;s one of many</p>
<p>in the galaxy?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a more, I dread, I sometimes think like,</p>
<p>God, what would it be like to live 300 years ago?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be looking up at the sky, I can&rsquo;t understand anything.</p>
<p>Oh my God, I&rsquo;d be like going to bed every night going,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on here?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, in some sense I agree with you,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not exactly sure.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m also a scientist, so I share your views,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not, we&rsquo;re like rolling down the hill together.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s down the hill?</p>
<p>I feel like we&rsquo;re climbing a hill.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting closer to enlightenment</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going down the hill.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re climbing, we&rsquo;re getting pulled up a hill</p>
<p>by our curiosity.</p>
<p>Our curiosity is, we&rsquo;re pulling ourselves up the hill</p>
<p>by our curiosity.</p>
<p>Yeah, Sisyphus was doing the same thing with the rock.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But okay, our happiness aside, do you have concerns</p>
<p>about, you talk about Sam Harris, Elon Musk,</p>
<p>of existential threats of intelligent systems?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not worried about existential threats at all.</p>
<p>There are some things we really do need to worry about.</p>
<p>Even today&rsquo;s AI, we have things we have to worry about.</p>
<p>We have to worry about privacy</p>
<p>and about how it impacts false beliefs in the world.</p>
<p>And we have real problems and things to worry about</p>
<p>with today&rsquo;s AI.</p>
<p>And that will continue as we create more intelligent systems.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question, the whole issue</p>
<p>about making intelligent armaments and weapons</p>
<p>is something that really we have to think about carefully.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think of those as existential threats.</p>
<p>I think those are the kind of threats we always face</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll have to face them here</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll have to deal with them.</p>
<p>We could talk about what people think</p>
<p>are the existential threats,</p>
<p>but when I hear people talking about them,</p>
<p>they all sound hollow to me.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re based on ideas, they&rsquo;re based on people</p>
<p>who really have no idea what intelligence is.</p>
<p>And if they knew what intelligence was,</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t say those things.</p>
<p>So those are not experts in the field.</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&rsquo;s two, right?</p>
<p>So one is like super intelligence.</p>
<p>So a system that becomes far, far superior</p>
<p>in reasoning ability than us humans.</p>
<p>How is that an existential threat?</p>
<p>Then, so there&rsquo;s a lot of ways in which it could be.</p>
<p>One way is us humans are actually irrational, inefficient</p>
<p>and get in the way of, not happiness,</p>
<p>but whatever the objective function is</p>
<p>of maximizing that objective function.</p>
<p>Super intelligent.</p>
<p>The paperclip problem and things like that.</p>
<p>So the paperclip problem but with the super intelligent.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So we already face this threat in some sense.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called bacteria.</p>
<p>These are organisms in the world</p>
<p>that would like to turn everything into bacteria.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re constantly morphing,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re constantly changing to evade our protections.</p>
<p>And in the past, they have killed huge swaths</p>
<p>of populations of humans on this planet.</p>
<p>So if you wanna worry about something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna multiply endlessly, we have it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m far more worried in that regard.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m far more worried that some scientists in the laboratory</p>
<p>will create a super virus or a super bacteria</p>
<p>that we cannot control.</p>
<p>That is a more of an existential threat.</p>
<p>Putting an intelligence thing on top of it</p>
<p>actually seems to make it less existential to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it limits its power.</p>
<p>It limits where it can go.</p>
<p>It limits the number of things it can do in many ways.</p>
<p>A bacteria is something you can&rsquo;t even see.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s only one of those problems.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>So the other one, just in your intuition about intelligence,</p>
<p>when you think about intelligence of us humans,</p>
<p>do you think of that as something,</p>
<p>if you look at intelligence on a spectrum</p>
<p>from zero to us humans,</p>
<p>do you think you can scale that to something far,</p>
<p>far superior to all the mechanisms we&rsquo;ve been talking about?</p>
<p>I wanna make another point here, Lex, before I get there.</p>
<p>Intelligence is the neocortex.</p>
<p>It is not the entire brain.</p>
<p>The goal is not to make a human.</p>
<p>The goal is not to make an emotional system.</p>
<p>The goal is not to make a system</p>
<p>that wants to have sex and reproduce.</p>
<p>Why would I build that?</p>
<p>If I wanna have a system that wants to reproduce</p>
<p>and have sex, make bacteria, make computer viruses.</p>
<p>Those are bad things, don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Those are really bad, don&rsquo;t do those things.</p>
<p>Regulate those.</p>
<p>But if I just say I want an intelligent system,</p>
<p>why does it have to have any of the human like emotions?</p>
<p>Why does it even care if it lives?</p>
<p>Why does it even care if it has food?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t care about those things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, you know, it&rsquo;s just in a trance</p>
<p>thinking about mathematics or it&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>just trying to build the space for it on Mars.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a choice we make.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t make human like things,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t make replicating things,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t make things that have emotions,</p>
<p>just stick to the neocortex.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a view actually that I share</p>
<p>but not everybody shares in the sense that</p>
<p>you have faith and optimism about us as engineers of systems,</p>
<p>humans as builders of systems to not put in stupid, not.</p>
<p>So this is why I mentioned the bacteria one.</p>
<p>Because you might say, well, some person&rsquo;s gonna do that.</p>
<p>Well, some person today could create a bacteria</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s resistant to all the known antibacterial agents.</p>
<p>So we already have that threat.</p>
<p>We already know this is going on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a new threat.</p>
<p>So just accept that and then we have to deal with it, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, so my point is nothing to do with intelligence.</p>
<p>Intelligence is a separate component</p>
<p>that you might apply to a system</p>
<p>that wants to reproduce and do stupid things.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not do that.</p>
<p>Yeah, in fact, it is a mystery</p>
<p>why people haven&rsquo;t done that yet.</p>
<p>My dad is a physicist, believes that the reason,</p>
<p>he says, for example, nuclear weapons haven&rsquo;t proliferated</p>
<p>amongst evil people.</p>
<p>So one belief that I share is that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not that many evil people in the world</p>
<p>that would use, whether it&rsquo;s bacteria or nuclear weapons</p>
<p>or maybe the future AI systems to do bad.</p>
<p>So the fraction is small.</p>
<p>And the second is that it&rsquo;s actually really hard,</p>
<p>technically, so the intersection between evil</p>
<p>and competent is small in terms of, and that&rsquo;s the.</p>
<p>And by the way, to really annihilate humanity,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have to have sort of the nuclear winter phenomenon,</p>
<p>which is not one person shooting or even 10 bombs.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have to have some automated system</p>
<p>that detonates a million bombs</p>
<p>or whatever many thousands we have.</p>
<p>So extreme evil combined with extreme competence.</p>
<p>And to start with building some stupid system</p>
<p>that would automatically, Dr. Strangelove type of thing,</p>
<p>you know, I mean, look, we could have</p>
<p>some nuclear bomb go off in some major city in the world.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s actually quite likely, even in my lifetime.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s an unlikely thing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;d be a tragedy.</p>
<p>But it won&rsquo;t be an existential threat.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the same as, you know, the virus of 1917,</p>
<p>whatever it was, you know, the influenza.</p>
<p>These bad things can happen and the plague and so on.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t always prevent them.</p>
<p>We always try, but we can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re not existential threats</p>
<p>until we combine all those crazy things together.</p>
<p>So on the spectrum of intelligence from zero to human,</p>
<p>do you have a sense of whether it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>to create several orders of magnitude</p>
<p>or at least double that of human intelligence?</p>
<p>Talking about neuro context.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the wrong thing to say double the intelligence.</p>
<p>Break it down into different components.</p>
<p>Can I make something that&rsquo;s a million times fast</p>
<p>than a human brain?</p>
<p>Yes, I can do that.</p>
<p>Could I make something that is,</p>
<p>has a lot more storage than the human brain?</p>
<p>Yes, I could do that.</p>
<p>More common, more copies of common.</p>
<p>Can I make something that attaches</p>
<p>to different sensors than human brain?</p>
<p>Yes, I can do that.</p>
<p>Could I make something that&rsquo;s distributed?</p>
<p>So these people, yeah, we talked early</p>
<p>about the departure of the neocortex voting.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to be co located.</p>
<p>Like, you know, they can be all around the place.</p>
<p>I could do that too.</p>
<p>Those are the levers I have, but is it more intelligent?</p>
<p>Well, it depends what I train it on.</p>
<p>What is it doing?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Well, so here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say larger neocortex</p>
<p>and or whatever size that allows for higher</p>
<p>and higher hierarchies to form,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about reference frames and concepts.</p>
<p>Could I have something that&rsquo;s a super physicist</p>
<p>or a super mathematician?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And the question is, once you have a super physicist,</p>
<p>will they be able to understand something?</p>
<p>Do you have a sense that it will be orders of math,</p>
<p>like us compared to ants?</p>
<p>Could we ever understand it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Most people cannot understand general relativity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really hard thing to get.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, you can paint it in a fuzzy picture,</p>
<p>stretchy space, you know?</p>
<p>But the field equations to do that</p>
<p>and the deep intuitions are really, really hard.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve tried, I&rsquo;m unable to do it.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s easy to get special relativity,</p>
<p>but general relativity, man, that&rsquo;s too much.</p>
<p>And so we already live with this to some extent.</p>
<p>The vast majority of people can&rsquo;t understand actually</p>
<p>what the vast majority of other people actually know.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just, either we don&rsquo;t have the effort to,</p>
<p>or we can&rsquo;t, or we don&rsquo;t have time,</p>
<p>or just not smart enough, whatever.</p>
<p>But we have ways of communicating.</p>
<p>Einstein has spoken in a way that I can understand.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s given me analogies that are useful.</p>
<p>I can use those analogies from my own work</p>
<p>and think about concepts that are similar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not stupid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s existing some other plane</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no connection with my plane in the world here.</p>
<p>So that will occur.</p>
<p>It already has occurred.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what my point of this story is.</p>
<p>It already has occurred.</p>
<p>We live it every day.</p>
<p>One could argue that when we create machine intelligence</p>
<p>that think a million times faster than us</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;ll be so far we can&rsquo;t make the connections.</p>
<p>But you know, at the moment,</p>
<p>everything that seems really, really hard</p>
<p>to figure out in the world,</p>
<p>when you actually figure it out, it&rsquo;s not that hard.</p>
<p>You know, almost everyone can understand the multiverses.</p>
<p>Almost everyone can understand quantum physics.</p>
<p>Almost everyone can understand these basic things,</p>
<p>even though hardly any people could figure those things out.</p>
<p>Yeah, but really understand.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t need to really.</p>
<p>Only a few people really understand.</p>
<p>You need to only understand the projections,</p>
<p>the sprinkles of the useful insights from that.</p>
<p>That was my example of Einstein, right?</p>
<p>His general theory of relativity is one thing</p>
<p>that very, very, very few people can get.</p>
<p>And what if we just said those other few people</p>
<p>are also artificial intelligences?</p>
<p>How bad is that?</p>
<p>In some sense they are, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, they say already.</p>
<p>I mean, Einstein wasn&rsquo;t a really normal person.</p>
<p>He had a lot of weird quirks.</p>
<p>And so did the other people who worked with him.</p>
<p>So, you know, maybe they already were sort of</p>
<p>this astral plane of intelligence that,</p>
<p>we live with it already.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still useful and, you know.</p>
<p>So do you think we are the only intelligent life</p>
<p>out there in the universe?</p>
<p>I would say that intelligent life</p>
<p>has and will exist elsewhere in the universe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say that.</p>
<p>There was a question about</p>
<p>contemporaneous intelligence life,</p>
<p>which is hard to even answer</p>
<p>when we think about relativity and the nature of space time.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t say what exactly is this time</p>
<p>someplace else in the world.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>I do worry a lot about the filter idea,</p>
<p>which is that perhaps intelligent species</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t last very long.</p>
<p>And so we haven&rsquo;t been around very long.</p>
<p>And as a technological species,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been around for almost nothing, you know.</p>
<p>What, 200 years, something like that.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t have any data,</p>
<p>a good data point on whether it&rsquo;s likely</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll survive or not.</p>
<p>So do I think that there have been intelligent life</p>
<p>elsewhere in the universe?</p>
<p>Almost certainly, of course.</p>
<p>In the past, in the future, yes.</p>
<p>Does it survive for a long time?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>This is another reason I&rsquo;m excited about our work,</p>
<p>is our work meaning the general world of AI.</p>
<p>I think we can build intelligent machines</p>
<p>that outlast us.</p>
<p>You know, they don&rsquo;t have to be tied to Earth.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying they&rsquo;re recreating, you know,</p>
<p>aliens, I&rsquo;m just saying,</p>
<p>if I asked myself,</p>
<p>and this might be a good point to end on here.</p>
<p>If I asked myself, you know,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s special about our species?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not particularly interesting physically.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t fly, we&rsquo;re not good swimmers,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not very fast, we&rsquo;re not very strong, you know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s our brain, that&rsquo;s the only thing.</p>
<p>And we are the only species on this planet</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s built the model of the world</p>
<p>that extends beyond what we can actually sense.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the only people who know about</p>
<p>the far side of the moon, and the other universes,</p>
<p>and I mean, other galaxies, and other stars,</p>
<p>and about what happens in the atom.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, that knowledge doesn&rsquo;t exist anywhere else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only in our heads.</p>
<p>Cats don&rsquo;t do it, dogs don&rsquo;t do it,</p>
<p>monkeys don&rsquo;t do it, it&rsquo;s just on.</p>
<p>And that is what we&rsquo;ve created that&rsquo;s unique.</p>
<p>Not our genes, it&rsquo;s knowledge.</p>
<p>And if I asked me, what is the legacy of humanity?</p>
<p>What should our legacy be?</p>
<p>It should be knowledge.</p>
<p>We should preserve our knowledge</p>
<p>in a way that it can exist beyond us.</p>
<p>And I think the best way of doing that,</p>
<p>in fact you have to do it,</p>
<p>is it has to go along with intelligent machines</p>
<p>that understand that knowledge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very broad idea, but we should be thinking,</p>
<p>I call it a state planning for humanity.</p>
<p>We should be thinking about what we wanna leave behind</p>
<p>when as a species we&rsquo;re no longer here.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;ll happen sometime.</p>
<p>Sooner or later it&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>And understanding intelligence and creating intelligence</p>
<p>gives us a better chance to prolong.</p>
<p>It does give us a better chance to prolong life, yes.</p>
<p>It gives us a chance to live on other planets.</p>
<p>But even beyond that, I mean our solar system</p>
<p>will disappear one day, just given enough time.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, I doubt we&rsquo;ll ever be able to travel</p>
<p>to other things, but we could tell the stars,</p>
<p>but we could send intelligent machines to do that.</p>
<p>So you have an optimistic, a hopeful view of our knowledge</p>
<p>of the echoes of human civilization</p>
<p>living through the intelligent systems we create?</p>
<p>Oh, totally.</p>
<p>Well, I think the intelligent systems we create</p>
<p>are in some sense the vessel for bringing them beyond Earth</p>
<p>or making them last beyond humans themselves.</p>
<p>How do you feel about that?</p>
<p>That they won&rsquo;t be human, quote unquote?</p>
<p>Who cares?</p>
<p>Human, what is human?</p>
<p>Our species are changing all the time.</p>
<p>Human today is not the same as human just 50 years ago.</p>
<p>What is human?</p>
<p>Do we care about our genetics?</p>
<p>Why is that important?</p>
<p>As I point out, our genetics are no more interesting</p>
<p>than a bacterium&rsquo;s genetics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no more interesting than a monkey&rsquo;s genetics.</p>
<p>What we have, what&rsquo;s unique and what&rsquo;s valuable</p>
<p>is our knowledge, what we&rsquo;ve learned about the world.</p>
<p>And that is the rare thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing we wanna preserve.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, who cares about our genes?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the knowledge.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really good place to end.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for talking to me.</p>
<p>No, it was fun.</p>
