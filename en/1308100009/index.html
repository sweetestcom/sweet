How are you?
I&amp;rsquo;m good.

I&amp;rsquo;m really anxious to greet one of the people at the door and say, step outside here.'>

    <p>Okay, ready?</p>
<p>One, two, three.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Hi, Jenny.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>What have you had it with?</p>
<p>I have had it with the continued idiocy of people that see the sign on the front door</p>
<p>of my office and continue to walk in to suite two looking for other suites.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really anxious to greet one of the people at the door and say, step outside here.</p>
<p>I want to ask you a question.</p>
<p>Did you read the sign and tell me what was the thought process in deciding to read it</p>
<p>and despite reading it to march right on in?</p>
<p>I need to know.</p>
<p>Let me understand what I can put on this door to have prevented you to walk in.</p>
<p>How about we don&rsquo;t give directions, we don&rsquo;t give advice.</p>
<p>Come in at your appointment and if you don&rsquo;t have one of those two, we will call the police.</p>
<p>What if you put, come through this door and I will blow your head off?</p>
<p>I mean, it is Oklahoma.</p>
<p>It could happen.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, Javi could be packing heat behind that desk and just pick people off.</p>
<p>Oh, I mean, I don&rsquo;t want to go that homicidal.</p>
<p>I appreciate.</p>
<p>I like the intensity because sometimes I feel homicidal, but I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>When you say that out loud, I think I realize how insane I am, but nonetheless, I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to work on it.</p>
<p>What have you had it with this week?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve had it with, you know, I&rsquo;m a new Instagram person.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve had it with is all these advertisements that are on your feed.</p>
<p>So like I bought into it right off the bat.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Emily was like, you&rsquo;re a rookie.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe you did that.</p>
<p>But so I get excited about these bras because what I hate about leisure bras is the pads</p>
<p>come out and when you wash them, you have to put the pads back in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a hassle.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So this bra, I mean, it just looked like this will be heaven on earth.</p>
<p>This is what you&rsquo;ve been waiting for your whole life.</p>
<p>So I order it and I&rsquo;m spoiled because we live in a town where Amazon lives.</p>
<p>So we get stuff same day sometimes.</p>
<p>This fucker, it was like four weeks on this bra.</p>
<p>Before it came.</p>
<p>Before it came.</p>
<p>Oh, Instagram, it&rsquo;s a big racket.</p>
<p>It came from like 55 countries away for this bra.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m excited about the bra, even though it took me a year to get it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still fired up about it.</p>
<p>Well, so I wash it.</p>
<p>That fucker, not only did the pads come out, one pad went into the other side of the bra.</p>
<p>So now both pads are in one side of the bra and I couldn&rsquo;t get it out and I had to throw</p>
<p>it away after one wash.</p>
<p>How was it the fit prior to the wash?</p>
<p>You know, it wasn&rsquo;t bad.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t bad.</p>
<p>I probably should have gotten an extra large instead of just a large, but I didn&rsquo;t put</p>
<p>that on the Instagram advertisement.</p>
<p>I just put that on your boobs are bigger than you want to admit to yourself.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So that wasn&rsquo;t so bad, but I just, Emily made fun of me.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re making fun of me.</p>
<p>You cannot buy shit off Instagram.</p>
<p>I fell for it a few times.</p>
<p>I bought some pajamas that look so cute on the model.</p>
<p>I was like, these are going to be great.</p>
<p>They come in, they&rsquo;re awful.</p>
<p>Horrible.</p>
<p>Sandpaper.</p>
<p>Not soft at all.</p>
<p>Sandpaper.</p>
<p>The fabric was wretched.</p>
<p>Complete, total scam racket.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It was total a scam.</p>
<p>And I think I pay like $12 for a leisure bra at like a Walmart or Target or Amazon or something.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It was, this was like $35, which I was happy to pay if I thought I didn&rsquo;t have to put the</p>
<p>pads back in after the washing machine.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But one pad migrated.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It was horrible.</p>
<p>It was worse than any of the other bras.</p>
<p>It was a migrating.</p>
<p>Migrating.</p>
<p>So you had like double protection on one sag and drag and then the other one was just</p>
<p>free-falling.</p>
<p>Bare nipple.</p>
<p>Bare nipple.</p>
<p>Like your ass on a toilet.</p>
<p>Like my ass on a toilet.</p>
<p>Welcome to I&rsquo;ve Had It Podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jennifer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Angie.</p>
<p>Jen and Neal are with us.</p>
<p>Richard is here.</p>
<p>And it is time, listener, it is time to drag out a dead horse and beat the shit out of</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And listener, I want you to understand that for 20 years, Pumps and I never tire of talking</p>
<p>about certain things.</p>
<p>And we call it a dead horse session.</p>
<p>And right now we are about to have our very first dead horse session on I&rsquo;ve Had It Podcast.</p>
<p>And the dead horse that we&rsquo;re dragging out today, that horse&rsquo;s name is Burning Man.</p>
<p>Since we recorded our Burning Man episode, Nealie and Jen went to Burning Man as you</p>
<p>and I know.</p>
<p>What the audience doesn&rsquo;t know is this fantastic, I mean amazing podcast would have started</p>
<p>about maybe six to eight weeks earlier than it did.</p>
<p>But these two producers, when you get back, apparently it&rsquo;s like a 120-day cleaning process</p>
<p>to get the dust not only out of every orifice of your body, your bags, your clothes, all</p>
<p>the shit they schlepped to Burning Man.</p>
<p>Like their U-Haul full of shit.</p>
<p>I remember when we called them, we gave them like four or five days after Burning Man because</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re like, they&rsquo;re outside, there&rsquo;s no plumbing, they&rsquo;re probably tired, you know, obviously.</p>
<p>We get them on FaceTime and we both hung up and we were like, they look like they have</p>
<p>been dragged behind a car.</p>
<p>They looked awful.</p>
<p>For a year.</p>
<p>I mean, honest to God, we thought you were dying.</p>
<p>We immediately talked.</p>
<p>I mean, we all looked terrible.</p>
<p>They looked horrible.</p>
<p>Not a follow-up phone call.</p>
<p>She called me, she said, can you believe how bad they look?</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m telling you, you could have gone down the road behind an 18-wheeler for three days</p>
<p>and looked better.</p>
<p>You could have been the poster child for PTSD.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m serious.</p>
<p>It was bad.</p>
<p>It could have been Google, Siri, show me what PTSD looks like.</p>
<p>And you two on the FaceTime screen could have popped up.</p>
<p>And then like, I mean, then I think we talked to him a few days after that and it was like,</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re still got that Burning Man and they still had that shit packed up and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like going box to box cleaning shit.</p>
<p>I would have to assume that you found sand in places that were never meant to have sand</p>
<p>in them.</p>
<p>We still have sand in a lot of places.</p>
<p>See?</p>
<p>Ladies, how was Burning Man?</p>
<p>How was it on a scale of zero to 10?</p>
<p>How was your Burning Man experience?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to give it a nine because the weather was terrible.</p>
<p>I mean, it was really hot.</p>
<p>And we had dust storms.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>Like in Afghanistan or something?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It was basically, yeah.</p>
<p>But I will say the rest of it was amazing.</p>
<p>Some of the most like creative people I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>The nights are the best.</p>
<p>You just ride your bikes around and like, look at all the different art installations</p>
<p>and the art cars.</p>
<p>And like, you would be so hot and then you would see this big like car, art car come</p>
<p>by and they would be making like fresh juice just to pass out to people for free.</p>
<p>Or like one time it was a margarita.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if y&rsquo;all have ever been to Mexico, but you can be on the beach and then the waiters</p>
<p>come by and they just pass out stuff to you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no dust storm.</p>
<p>So like we stayed up one night to watch this DJ that we both love and it was the sunrise</p>
<p>set and we were getting hungry and this guy passed by and he had fresh pancakes and he</p>
<p>was just passing them all around and we were like, this is a godsend.</p>
<p>Playa provides.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So you won&rsquo;t sit on a toilet seat, you have her, but she&rsquo;ll eat a pancake from a total</p>
<p>stranger with a desk bowl?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I need to know.</p>
<p>Did you shit or piss in the bucket?</p>
<p>Neither of us pooped in the bucket.</p>
<p>We did pee in it in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>One morning I wake up to a horrible, horrible smell.</p>
<p>I was dehydrated.</p>
<p>Dehydrated.</p>
<p>I had to jump out of the tent because it was disgusting.</p>
<p>If this isn&rsquo;t alarming enough.</p>
<p>I think we have to bring our good friend Bob the Builder back.</p>
<p>We have another friend of theirs that was in their camp and his name is Omid.</p>
<p>And so I actually got to FaceTime with Omid while they were on their way back from Burning</p>
<p>Man and I heard probably one of the more alarming stories that I&rsquo;ve ever heard in my entire</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>Worse than the pee?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve kept it under lock and key because I want to sit back and watch your reaction live</p>
<p>as he tells you what he told me.</p>
<p>So without further ado, let&rsquo;s get their playmates, the Burning Man playmates in.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>T-Bob it up.</p>
<p>Pumps.</p>
<p>Pumps, are you excited to see Bob?</p>
<p>Are you excited to see Bob?</p>
<p>I mean, I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s precious.</p>
<p>He is precious.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t he?</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;re trying to hit on him.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Who cares?</p>
<p>Hi Bob the Builder.</p>
<p>Bob.</p>
<p>Oh, hey, hey.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Omid.</p>
<p>Hi Omid.</p>
<p>Hi Pumps.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so good to see you guys.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I have to say Bob, after we did that episode with you, we just full blown changed your</p>
<p>name to Bob.</p>
<p>Bob the Builder.</p>
<p>So if we start calling you Bob, it&rsquo;s just, you are Bob in our world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>And I apologize, but that&rsquo;s just who you are.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve got to get right to the nut cutting here.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I know that since we did our Burning Man episode, you guys have had a lot of fun.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had a lot of fun.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had a lot of fun.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had a lot of fun.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had a lot of fun.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had a lot of fun.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had a lot of fun.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had a lot of fun.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had a lot of fun.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard some rather alarming stories, but Omid, you may remember that I FaceTimed with</p>
<p>you when you were in the Jeep with Jen and Nellie on your way back.</p>
<p>And you told me a story that was incredibly eyebrow raising to say the least.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to sit here with my eyes fixated on pumps, and I want you to tell her about</p>
<p>the tattoo parlor at the Burning Man.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So this was me getting a temporary tattoo at Burning Man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at a gay camp called Celestial Bodies, which is our favorite place to hang out at</p>
<p>Burning Man.</p>
<p>They have the best cocktails.</p>
<p>But on Tuesdays, they give temporary tattoos.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a very sexy man with a big beard that&rsquo;s seated.</p>
<p>And you stand in front of him, and you tell him where you want your tattoo.</p>
<p>And I picked my butt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really fun.</p>
<p>But he first starts with prepping the area by exfoliating it with his beard.</p>
<p>So he rubs his beard all over your butt.</p>
<p>And then he puts the temporary tattoo on, but while he&rsquo;s applying the pressure so that</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t tip over, he cups you, your junk, and he holds on to you while the temporary</p>
<p>tattoo&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And then afterwards, to seal the tattoo, he takes a puff of his vape pen and then blows</p>
<p>it very gently all over your butt area, just to kind of seal it all in.</p>
<p>I think that that might be a salt.</p>
<p>Okay, what&rsquo;s the deal with he grabs your junk?</p>
<p>So that you don&rsquo;t tip over, because he has to apply pressure to the tattoo.</p>
<p>And you might tip over unless he was cupping your junk the whole time simultaneously.</p>
<p>Could you bend over a chair?</p>
<p>You could.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as fun.</p>
<p>Bob, did you get any sort of tattoos or ass crack beard exfoliation when you were at the</p>
<p>Burning Man?</p>
<p>I did not this year, no, but I have in previous years.</p>
<p>Have you given any exfoliation with the beard at Burning Man?</p>
<p>I know, but I do do a lot of beard rubs with other good bearded guys.</p>
<p>We like to get together and just mess around.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a beard rub?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Just two guys.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like an Eskimo kiss, where you kiss the noses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that one with the beard, and you&rsquo;re just kind of rubbing your beard together.</p>
<p>Every good bearded man loves another good bearded man.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter your sexual preference.</p>
<p>We just love it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a beautiful beard.</p>
<p>I always touch his beard every time I see him.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He does have a good looking beard.</p>
<p>He does.</p>
<p>I mean, you do.</p>
<p>He does.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I like the specks.</p>
<p>Those are nice looking specks.</p>
<p>Josh Welch would really like him.</p>
<p>That haircut&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You have some natural curl, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Lots of it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Her husband.</p>
<p>I have questions.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Oh, ask.</p>
<p>Go.</p>
<p>Fire away.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>Your husband would like a curly headed guy?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s vain.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s incredibly vain.</p>
<p>He wouldn&rsquo;t like you sexually.</p>
<p>He would appreciate your aesthetic and your sense of style.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;d think you were attractive.</p>
<p>He would say, that don&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s a good looking guy.</p>
<p>I liked his specks.</p>
<p>I liked his hair.</p>
<p>I liked his beard.</p>
<p>I mean, he is comfortable enough in his sexuality to tell you that he likes your look.</p>
<p>You should bring him to Burning Man.</p>
<p>I would rather paint the interior walls of my entire office building with a Q-tip, base</p>
<p>coat, first coat, top coat, then a sealer, then go to Burning Man.</p>
<p>But listen, I&rsquo;m all swing for the fences.</p>
<p>If y&rsquo;all like it, I want to know every nutty detail.</p>
<p>I want to get to the deep, dark bottom, inject this shit into my veins.</p>
<p>What other crazy shit did you do?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I had a question that I didn&rsquo;t ask last time, Bobbett.</p>
<p>So in the orgy tent, do you consent, like, do you fill out, like, before you go in, are</p>
<p>you like, hey, I&rsquo;m all the way, I&rsquo;m going all the way, I&rsquo;m doing three ways, but play</p>
<p>all of it?</p>
<p>Or is it like consent is just a little bit at a time?</p>
<p>Consent with who?</p>
<p>Like the other orgy members.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s like a little bit at a time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like what middle schoolers did with those colored bands on their wrists, you know?</p>
<p>In the moment, someone asks, do you say yes or no?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an orgy dome.</p>
<p>And then there is-</p>
<p>Oh, shut the fuck up.</p>
<p>An orgy dome?</p>
<p>Dome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the orgy dome.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re wildly popular.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, of course.</p>
<p>I could imagine.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I actually went into the orgy dome out of curiosity.</p>
<p>Every detail.</p>
<p>Go.</p>
<p>Go on.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just looking at the pictures in Playboy, too.</p>
<p>So Playboy.</p>
<p>Playgirl.</p>
<p>Playgirl.</p>
<p>Playgirl.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So I was with two female friends and you have to be either a couple or a morsem to get into</p>
<p>the orgy dome.</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a morsem?</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>Is a morsem like a throuple?</p>
<p>A morsem is more than a couple.</p>
<p>So yeah, a throuple or maybe you&rsquo;re in a polyamorous relationship with four people, but you have</p>
<p>to be more than a single person.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So basically, I think that they&rsquo;re trying to make sure that single guys don&rsquo;t wander</p>
<p>in there and just like lurk.</p>
<p>I think the only rule in there is consent.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t like, you know, obviously.</p>
<p>And then the other thing and the thing that we got kicked out of there for was they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really like lurkers.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t really like observers.</p>
<p>We were just a little stunned and just sitting on the couch and I was with two friends.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the oversight in this?</p>
<p>Who kicked you out?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the dome sheriff?</p>
<p>Georgie Dome is an actual Burning Man camp.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the kicker.</p>
<p>My accountant belongs to that camp.</p>
<p>Shut the fuck up.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s so good.</p>
<p>Did you know he was part of that camp or did you see him?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know then.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So Bob, tell us about what you built.</p>
<p>This year, Son and I helped build like the kitchen.</p>
<p>We built like a sink that had somewhat of a success, had a shower that also had somewhat</p>
<p>of a success, growing pains.</p>
<p>And then the rest of it was like building camp structures and stuff with the rest of</p>
<p>the team.</p>
<p>We all pitched in for that stuff.</p>
<p>Bob, did you enjoy the dust storm?</p>
<p>I loved it.</p>
<p>One of my favorite moments was like 24 hours of pure wind and dust because it was great.</p>
<p>The entire camp came together to secure stuff, hold things.</p>
<p>And then my wife&rsquo;s son is running around with like a gigantic handle of a fireball, making</p>
<p>everybody take shots.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re just getting drunk, laughing with all your friends.</p>
<p>It was the best time possible.</p>
<p>We did see a picture of you, Bob.</p>
<p>In the camp.</p>
<p>Which one?</p>
<p>Well, you were&hellip;</p>
<p>When I say face&hellip;</p>
<p>I was passed out on the ground like that?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Face down eating dirt.</p>
<p>You looked destroyed.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, you looked absolutely annihilated.</p>
<p>For my birthday this year, which is like a month after the burn, my wife had that framed</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s now hanging in our kitchen.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Were you exhausted when you got back?</p>
<p>It still took another two months for me to start feeling really normal at work again.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I just constantly wanted to call and quit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I want to tap into right there because Jen and Nealey, we FaceTime them and</p>
<p>it is like fucking zombie apocalypse.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>They were the poster child of PTSD.</p>
<p>It was so alarming that after the FaceTime, Pumps immediately called me and she said,</p>
<p>God, can you believe how terrible they look?</p>
<p>I was like, how about we&rsquo;re just finding out about something.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first time anything like it.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like they ate&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;ve seen those age progressions, like the meth ads.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exactly what it was, like 10 years of meth in one week.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this.</p>
<p>Are you going next year?</p>
<p>Bob, you go first.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we can.</p>
<p>Plot twist.</p>
<p>Plot twist.</p>
<p>Plot twist.</p>
<p>Because my wife is now pregnant.</p>
<p>Oh, yay!</p>
<p>Congratulations.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Come on, Bobette.</p>
<p>Bring the baby.</p>
<p>Honestly, it&rsquo;s going to be my greatest success is being a dad.</p>
<p>I already know that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready to buy those classic white New Balances and crappy T-shirts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so ready.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to crush that job.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got jokes lined up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it podcast onesie that we&rsquo;re going to send your baby.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It says, yes, not invited to the pool party.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so ready.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so ready.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so ready.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so ready.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so ready.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so ready.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so ready.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so ready.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so ready.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so ready.</p>
<p>It says, yes, not invited to the pool party.</p>
<p>For me, I don&rsquo;t end up looking like a zombie four days after.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually the freshest and the happiest that you&rsquo;re going to get me all year long.</p>
<p>And you get a month and a half of it where I&rsquo;m just glowing and excited about life again.</p>
<p>And then when work fully sucks me back in, you just see, well, that&rsquo;s when I turn into</p>
<p>a depressed zombie.</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s where I open up and I have finally allowed myself to be who</p>
<p>I fully am.</p>
<p>And I have zero fears about who I am and controlling myself because I have to act and be a certain</p>
<p>way in society.</p>
<p>I can just be myself.</p>
<p>And everyone I&rsquo;m there with, Jen, Millie, Omi, all of our camp, they make sure that</p>
<p>I am that person when I leave.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re my community.</p>
<p>This year was huge for me.</p>
<p>I actually didn&rsquo;t even see a lot of the city or a lot of the art because I was always at</p>
<p>camp with all of my friends.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I cared about was being back with my community.</p>
<p>And it made me feel whole again.</p>
<p>And it made me feel excited to just get back into life and to do things.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t had it in three years and I needed it.</p>
<p>I need it every year.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really sweet.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s kind of touching, Bob.</p>
<p>It really is.</p>
<p>Omi, what do you love?</p>
<p>Well, he likes the orgy.</p>
<p>So as I&rsquo;ve been eight years now, I always say it restores my faith in humanity.</p>
<p>I see people at their best.</p>
<p>I think that you guys, specifically, I think Jennifer would really enjoy Burning Man.</p>
<p>My point being that when you interact with someone, you&rsquo;re probably not going to be your</p>
<p>most unguarded sort of self.</p>
<p>Every year it takes me 48 hours for my shoulders to come down at Burning Man.</p>
<p>So I thought that it was only going to be the first year when it happened, but it happens</p>
<p>every year.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s because you have to have some sort of a shield on in the outside world</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just not safe.</p>
<p>People just have all kinds of intentions and you don&rsquo;t want to be a naive person just sort</p>
<p>of whistling your way through dodgy parts of the world.</p>
<p>But at Burning Man, it really feels so kind and so safe.</p>
<p>And everyone&rsquo;s lovely.</p>
<p>We always say it&rsquo;s the best place to have an emergency because people will help you,</p>
<p>but also literally go completely out of their way to get you whatever you need.</p>
<p>Not that you should rely on them, but if you needed them, they would be there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best kind of person that goes there.</p>
<p>It is a lot of work prepping, cleaning up afterwards.</p>
<p>You come back completely depleted.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>This year was really, really hard for a whole host of reasons.</p>
<p>If I was betting right now, I would say probably go back.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Probably go.</p>
<p>Ellie and Jen, are you going to go?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You are going to go next year?</p>
<p>You hope to?</p>
<p>Sana!</p>
<p>Ellie!</p>
<p>Congratulations!</p>
<p>Sana!</p>
<p>Congratulations on your baby.</p>
<p>Sana had to check out the competition.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very impressed with your husband and all his industriousness.</p>
<p>She really is.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s shocking how somebody can do that.</p>
<p>At what age will you take the child to Burning Man?</p>
<p>I think six.</p>
<p>I think six.</p>
<p>I think six.</p>
<p>I think six.</p>
<p>I think six.</p>
<p>I think six.</p>
<p>I think six.</p>
<p>I think six.</p>
<p>I think six.</p>
<p>I think six.</p>
<p>I think six.</p>
<p>I think six.</p>
<p>I think six or seven.</p>
<p>Six or seven.</p>
<p>Six or seven would be a good age.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t take them any earlier.</p>
<p>You see little babies out there sometimes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just terrible.</p>
<p>Their little lungs.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a giant playground.</p>
<p>So it is an amazing, amazing place for a kid.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even want to take a baby to Target.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m damn sure wouldn&rsquo;t want to take a baby to camp for eight days.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do a lightning round.</p>
<p>Did you guys cuddle puddle this year?</p>
<p>Yes or no?</p>
<p>Sana, you go first.</p>
<p>No, I did not cuddle puddle.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of cuddle puddles.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I like her.</p>
<p>Bob?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with Bob.</p>
<p>I heard your last episode about, Bob, it was like, were you talking about Pink Heart, the</p>
<p>biggest cuddle puddle on the play?</p>
<p>I actually climbed into that room.</p>
<p>What do you mean climbed?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a door?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on with the climbing?</p>
<p>So Bob looked at the room and was like, nope, and turned around.</p>
<p>I was like, yes, and I took my shoes off and went in.</p>
<p>And you have to, so that it&rsquo;s just like a mess of pillows and teddy bears and people</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t just walk in, you have to crawl in and you can&rsquo;t, you have to be, you have</p>
<p>to be mindful of your elbows and your knees because it&rsquo;s like people underneath you.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting to just climb your way through and it smells like a thousand farts</p>
<p>in there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was going to ask.</p>
<p>Like how bad does it smell?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t smell great.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s real grit at Burning Man and I would say the smell in the Pink Heart cuddle puddle</p>
<p>room is one of them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What about BO?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gross.</p>
<p>No BO.</p>
<p>No BO.</p>
<p>I smell more BO at the local gay bar in Silver Lake than I have at Burning Man.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>That is true.</p>
<p>Jim, did you go to a cuddle puddle?</p>
<p>No, I did not.</p>
<p>Good for you.</p>
<p>Nellie?</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t go to a cuddle puddle.</p>
<p>Okay, good.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Did you shit in a bucket?</p>
<p>You guys went down a really dark rabbit hole on the whole shitting in the bucket.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine anyone shitting in their tent in a bucket.</p>
<p>Yeah, no.</p>
<p>But we just found out a couple of weeks ago, Pumps, when she&rsquo;s at a public toilet, most</p>
<p>women hover, you know, you squat and hover and kind of get a good look.</p>
<p>She barebacks it in a public toilet.</p>
<p>She just goes right in and sits down on a bareback.</p>
<p>So you sit-</p>
<p>I would never bareback a toilet seat, ever, ever, ever.</p>
<p>Never.</p>
<p>Never.</p>
<p>Never.</p>
<p>I would never bareback a public toilet seat, ever, ever.</p>
<p>So I had to get over the Burning Man port-a-potties the first time I went because I had a legitimate</p>
<p>fear.</p>
<p>But the same playa dust that sort of settles BO kind of calms down the situation in the</p>
<p>port-a-potties.</p>
<p>So it isn&rsquo;t as horrible as you would imagine.</p>
<p>I will bareback a public toilet, but I will not go in a port-a-potty.</p>
<p>I will stand next to it and shit on the ground before I will bareback a toilet.</p>
<p>I would.</p>
<p>I cannot.</p>
<p>Those are gross.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re disgusting.</p>
<p>Horrible.</p>
<p>They-</p>
<p>Horrible.</p>
<p>I have peed behind, like at football games back in the day, they&rsquo;d have port-a-potties</p>
<p>set up and people would be in line and I&rsquo;d just go right behind it and pee.</p>
<p>Are you jealous that Bob is having a baby?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thrilled.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to be great parents.</p>
<p>Think of all the shit he&rsquo;s getting.</p>
<p>Think about his treehouse.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>It will be like next level treehouse.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Bob here is going to build a treehouse for him.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>Well, congratulations again.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Anything else dicey that went down?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I want the good shit.</p>
<p>Anything else go down in Burning Man that we need to air out?</p>
<p>Jennifer, I feel like I need to tell you some things that might entice you to maybe one</p>
<p>day consider going to Burning Man.</p>
<p>Later.</p>
<p>Like imagine it&rsquo;s morning and you&rsquo;re riding your bike, an electric bike, so you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to work really hard.</p>
<p>I like that exercise.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, oh, great.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great breakfast.</p>
<p>But imagine there&rsquo;s a sign that says breakfast martinis.</p>
<p>And you just stop and you go in and all of a sudden, it&rsquo;s the most like a craft cocktail</p>
<p>shaken, served in like a chilled glass.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, you&rsquo;re having the perfect martini where like two minutes ago, you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even know you were going to have the perfect breakfast cocktail.</p>
<p>Let me tell you the flaw on that story.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t drink alcohol because my husband&rsquo;s a recovering drug addict and alcoholic that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been to rehab five times.</p>
<p>And so after the fifth rehab stint, I thought, well, fuck it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just quit drinking too.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m already out on the Burning Man martini bar that crashed and burned.</p>
<p>What else you got for me?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re riding your bike.</p>
<p>Riding my bike.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go back to the bike.</p>
<p>Riding my bike.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting great cardio.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, you smell hot chocolate chip cookies.</p>
<p>Like freshly baked.</p>
<p>I love chocolate chip cookies.</p>
<p>And you realize that there&rsquo;s a tray, like there&rsquo;s a person with a tray of hot cookies</p>
<p>and all you have to do to get one is to get paddled on your behind.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>With like a leather.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Like S&amp;M?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>For a cookie?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to have to be a lot more than a cookie.</p>
<p>So you have to get spanked to get the cookie?</p>
<p>Have you guys not ever stayed in a fucking five-star hotel?</p>
<p>You literally, all you have to do is pick up the phone and say, could you please bring</p>
<p>some chocolate chip cookies to room 402?</p>
<p>And they say, it&rsquo;s my pleasure.</p>
<p>And then a dominatrix.</p>
<p>And then they bring them.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to get spanked.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to ride a bike.</p>
<p>It just happens.</p>
<p>But you can get a dominatrix at a five-star hotel too.</p>
<p>And someone was going to spank me for a grilled cheese sandwich.</p>
<p>It was nice.</p>
<p>It was worth it.</p>
<p>I have to.</p>
<p>Y&rsquo;all are getting spanked to get food.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is what&rsquo;s another thing that&rsquo;s going on at Burning Man is you have to get a whooping.</p>
<p>This whole podcast is based on you guys, you know, loving, playful.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And each other.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all Burning Man is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s one, eight, it&rsquo;s eight days of just ridiculous, playful interactions.</p>
<p>And sometimes, like, it&rsquo;s just really dumb.</p>
<p>Like, you get spanked and you get a chocolate chip cookie.</p>
<p>How long did it take you to get out?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>Six hours.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s just torture.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t that bad.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re going to deliver a baby in less time than it took you to get out of Burning</p>
<p>Man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great point.</p>
<p>Is that a promise?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to even do something that feels good for six hours.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like, six hours is too long.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>We had really fun, though.</p>
<p>We had fun in the exit.</p>
<p>We had fun.</p>
<p>At that point.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t decide if this whole Burning Man thing is, like, shared psychosis or if I am just</p>
<p>a horrible candidate for it.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re horrible candidates, because I kind of teared up when Bob was talking about</p>
<p>why he liked it.</p>
<p>Like, the community aspect of it.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really feel that much.</p>
<p>I feel like I could have&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to be honest.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s sweet that that&rsquo;s your reality, but it didn&rsquo;t move the meter.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make me want to go.</p>
<p>I found that the people that resisted the most are the ones that needed the most.</p>
<p>Like, that would get the most out of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably 100% true.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question that I am stage five, fucked up, cynical, negative, that it could</p>
<p>probably open me up, and I could be a kinder, gentler person.</p>
<p>The problem is I would have to have a lot of interactions with human beings, and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really like human beings.</p>
<p>But maybe you would if you liked a Burning Man.</p>
<p>I like humanity, but, like, if there was a dog Burning Man where we could go hang out</p>
<p>with dogs, I&rsquo;m in.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to interact with people if you don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>You could be like, I don&rsquo;t want to, and just do you, but I feel like you would open up</p>
<p>like a beautiful little&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just still so many fundamental things that Burning Man is lacking for me to be a</p>
<p>good candidate.</p>
<p>And I just think about all the sand in your machine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m open to going, like, a rehab for a while and working on Little Jennifer and writing</p>
<p>letters to Little Jennifer in my non-dominant hand and getting in touch with my inner child.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m open to all that shit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d cuddle a teddy bear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d do all this shit in Malibu where normal people go to get in touch with their feelings.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to go to the desert and be in a dust storm with goggles.</p>
<p>I think that we could change that.</p>
<p>I think you guys would be so funny.</p>
<p>You guys would be so fun out there because there&rsquo;s so much to laugh at.</p>
<p>I think you would just have a ball.</p>
<p>You would scream from laughter every day.</p>
<p>But then I&rsquo;d get sand in my mouth if I scream with laughter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a minefield.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a minefield of potential issues.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, everything&rsquo;s a good and a bad.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, my Middle Eastern body has no issue with the dust.</p>
<p>I rarely even need to cover my nose and mouth, you know, unless there&rsquo;s like a severe dust</p>
<p>storm.</p>
<p>But, you know, I&rsquo;m from Iran.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so windy in Oklahoma City, my eyes are like swollen after just being like walking</p>
<p>from my car into the office.</p>
<p>Can you imagine?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m so happy that you all made it out.</p>
<p>And it looks like we&rsquo;re not going to have potentially repeat visits in this next calendar</p>
<p>year.</p>
<p>Except for these two.</p>
<p>Except for, you two are going for sure, Nellie and Jen?</p>
<p>We hope to.</p>
<p>Omid&rsquo;s going to go too.</p>
<p>Jen, Jen.</p>
<p>Peer pressure.</p>
<p>Jen took to it.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t believe.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s about having a sense, like, her sense of adventure, I think, is so big</p>
<p>that she just was like, I&rsquo;ve come home, you know, to the place where I can just have that</p>
<p>infinity.</p>
<p>Like, Jen just having fun.</p>
<p>Well, do you think, has this moved the needle for you at all, Pums, do you think you would</p>
<p>go to Burning Man?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Hard pass.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like group activities.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to do any of those things.</p>
<p>I love the Amalfi Coast.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Do you think you can pamper yourself in luxury while at Burning Man?</p>
<p>Like, just set yourself up really nicely?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>I, when I want to be pampered, I don&rsquo;t want to do that for myself.</p>
<p>What I consider being pampered is having services provided for me by others.</p>
<p>Do you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Well, you could get a spanking and a grilled cheese.</p>
<p>I just would hate for you not to even try it once, you know?</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Just once.</p>
<p>Just once try it.</p>
<p>I would have a lot of hostage demands.</p>
<p>I mean, like, it would be like, I would have a huge demand list.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the recipient of this list?</p>
<p>Well, y&rsquo;all are the ones campaigning for me.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So it sounds like you all are going to be meeting the needs.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to go.</p>
<p>Y&rsquo;all are the ones that want me to go, so I mean, I&rsquo;ll just provide the list.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be you three, you five motherfuckers.</p>
<p>Let me figure it out.</p>
<p>The needle has not moved.</p>
<p>It is my absolute worst possible case scenario is Burning Man.</p>
<p>Like, if you want to tour, you&rsquo;re very un-Guantanamo.</p>
<p>We just launched our merch page, and guess what one of the shirts is that we&rsquo;re selling?</p>
<p>Boycott Burning Man.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to be condescending.</p>
<p>Are we condescending?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really.</p>
<p>I mean, we have a podcast called I&rsquo;ve Had It.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re way past being condescending at this point.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably true.</p>
<p>Are there others out there like us that are &hellip;</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s 340 million people in the world and only 70,000 get a Burning Man.</p>
<p>That don&rsquo;t like fun and creativity.</p>
<p>Burning Man haters.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We hate fun.</p>
<p>I have been that person.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s normal at one point during the week to be like, what am I doing here?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It means really he&rsquo;s campaigning.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s on the public relations tour.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m saying &hellip;</p>
<p>But I want to thank you all so much.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Listen, I know we&rsquo;re cynical and I know we&rsquo;re Burning Man haters, but we do love people</p>
<p>and we do love Jen and Nealey and that you all have so much fun together on this trip</p>
<p>and you make all of these memories.</p>
<p>I truly appreciate that and I do think it&rsquo;s absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>I would love to travel with you guys.</p>
<p>Simply Burning Man is just not an option for me personally.</p>
<p>And I think if I went-</p>
<p>No camping.</p>
<p>You would think to yourself, why the fuck did we campaign to bring this woman with us?</p>
<p>I think that would probably happen.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d end up hating her.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better this way.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It is better.</p>
<p>And you would really end up hating her.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>She has a party trick.</p>
<p>She would be a million times worse than I would be.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I can hang a hanger off my nipples if I want to.</p>
<p>So that would be my trick for grilled cheeses and chocolate chip cookies.</p>
<p>I would cut that line and be like, move back, motherfuckers.</p>
<p>Watch this.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d be the queen of the whole thing.</p>
<p>She used to be able to balance it with a garment on it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And now-</p>
<p>Gravity.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Now she can still do just the hanger.</p>
<p>Just the basic wire hanger at this point.</p>
<p>You know.</p>
<p>Probably got about five more years of that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>The nipples are really impressive.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They are.</p>
<p>They are.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>They are.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re impressive nipples.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>They are.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like a really elongated pencil eraser that you can actually support something.</p>
<p>And now the death of the podcast.</p>
<p>The last thing we ever say was about my nipples.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so desperate.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re dragging out your pony trick.</p>
<p>My pony trick.</p>
<p>My party trick.</p>
<p>All that&rsquo;s to say, thanks for being on today.</p>
<p>Thank you for being a guest.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>It was so fun.</p>
<p>And thank you for being open and vulnerable and sharing in what was probably a hostile</p>
<p>environment for you all.</p>
<p>I really appreciate that.</p>
<p>Never.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not lost on me that you walk into this hostility and this cynicism and you just</p>
<p>still own your truth.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I love that you guys are friends with our friends and I hope that we can go to a five</p>
<p>star hotel together sometime soon.</p>
<p>But not with your baby.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to tell you until he&rsquo;s about 10.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t like babies very much.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s too late for her.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s going to have to go through it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way back now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way back.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got to cut, babe.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Bye guys.</p>
<p>Love you.</p>
<p>Good to see you.</p>
<p>Thanks so much.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>That was&hellip;</p>
<p>Was that bad?</p>
<p>Why was that so bad?</p>
<p>I mean&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the bad one.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the bad one.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the bad one.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the bad one.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the bad one.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the bad one.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the bad one.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the bad one.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the bad one.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the one that her people want to come to the pool party.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on a onesie.</p>
<p>I want to say to you guys, I absolutely love your friends.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re great.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re awesome.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re amazing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad that you all have these wonderful experiences with them.</p>
<p>I want to say to everybody, follow us, like us, pumps.</p>
<p>Tell everybody how to find our merch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it dot com.</p>
<p>That was wrong.</p>
<p>That was completely wrong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it podcast dot com.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Everybody&hellip;</p>
<p>No, you have to do it.</p>
<p>You have to do it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
