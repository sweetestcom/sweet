    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>This month, we&rsquo;re talking all about disorders of the mind.</p>
<p>Things like depression, attention deficit disorders,</p>
<p>eating disorders, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>During the course of this month,</p>
<p>we are going to discuss the psychological</p>
<p>and biological underpinnings of mood disorders</p>
<p>of all kinds.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll learn a lot of science.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll also learn a lot about the various treatments</p>
<p>that exist and that are in development</p>
<p>for these various mood disorders.</p>
<p>We will talk about behavioral tools,</p>
<p>things like exercise, meditation, breath work,</p>
<p>but also prescription drugs, supplements,</p>
<p>and novel compounds that are now being tested</p>
<p>in various clinical trials.</p>
<p>Across the month,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ll start to realize</p>
<p>that there are common pathways</p>
<p>underlying many mood disorders.</p>
<p>In fact, mood disorders that look quite different</p>
<p>from one another often depend on the action</p>
<p>of the same neurochemicals or neural circuits</p>
<p>in the brain and body.</p>
<p>That actually should be a point of great relief</p>
<p>because what it means is that by understanding the biology</p>
<p>of one mood disorder,</p>
<p>or understanding how one treatment</p>
<p>or behavioral intervention can impact a mood disorder,</p>
<p>we gain insight into other mood disorders as well.</p>
<p>As always, we will discuss science</p>
<p>and science-related tools that people could implement</p>
<p>should they choose.</p>
<p>Before we dive into today&rsquo;s topic,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to discuss a very particular set</p>
<p>of scientific findings that relate to today&rsquo;s topic</p>
<p>and that are important for understanding all mood disorders</p>
<p>and all states of motivation, happiness, and sadness,</p>
<p>as well as depression.</p>
<p>Basically, I&rsquo;m going to paraphrase a brief segment</p>
<p>of my discussion with Dr. Anna Lembke,</p>
<p>who I sat down with to discuss addiction</p>
<p>and the biological basis of addiction</p>
<p>and addiction treatment.</p>
<p>A very important aspect of that discussion</p>
<p>was when Dr. Lembke described the pleasure-pain balance,</p>
<p>literally the circuits in our brains</p>
<p>that control our sense of pleasure and pain,</p>
<p>and ultimately, whether or not we remain happy</p>
<p>in our pursuit of pleasure or not.</p>
<p>This is an absolutely crucial aspect</p>
<p>to the way that we function in everyday life,</p>
<p>and especially under conditions of mood disorders.</p>
<p>The pathway that she was describing</p>
<p>is the so-called pleasure system.</p>
<p>However, what most people don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>is that the pleasure system is also directly associated with,</p>
<p>and in fact, is the very same system</p>
<p>that modulates mental or psychological anguish and pain.</p>
<p>Essentially, what she described</p>
<p>is that whenever we pursue something</p>
<p>that we think will bring us pleasure,</p>
<p>and that could be anything</p>
<p>that we think will bring us pleasure,</p>
<p>from food to video games to sex</p>
<p>to a particular job or goal, short-term or long-term,</p>
<p>that we experience release of the neuromodulator dopamine.</p>
<p>Now, dopamine is associated</p>
<p>with increased levels of motivation and drive.</p>
<p>It is not the molecule of reward.</p>
<p>It is the molecule of craving, motivation, and drive.</p>
<p>However, as Dr. Lembke pointed out,</p>
<p>when we are in pursuit of something,</p>
<p>there is a release of dopamine in our brain.</p>
<p>That makes us feel motivated,</p>
<p>and in general, it makes us feel good.</p>
<p>But very shortly thereafter,</p>
<p>and beneath our conscious awareness,</p>
<p>there is a tilt of the pleasure-pain balance in the brain,</p>
<p>literally a shift in the neural circuits</p>
<p>that underlie pleasure and pain,</p>
<p>such that every bit of pleasure or pleasure-seeking</p>
<p>that causes release of dopamine</p>
<p>will be balanced out by a little bit of pain.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t experience this as physical pain,</p>
<p>at least not at first.</p>
<p>We experience it as craving for more</p>
<p>of the thing that brought us pleasure.</p>
<p>Now, that sounds pretty good.</p>
<p>You get pleasure,</p>
<p>and then you get a little bit of pain to balance it out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s subconscious,</p>
<p>and you experience it as the desire</p>
<p>to seek out more pleasure.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s actually more diabolical than that,</p>
<p>and we really need to keep an eye on this</p>
<p>if we are to remain happy,</p>
<p>if we are to remain in pursuit of our goals.</p>
<p>The crucial thing to understand</p>
<p>is that if we remain in constant pursuit of pleasure,</p>
<p>the pain side of the balance tips</p>
<p>so that each time we are in pursuit</p>
<p>of that pleasureful thing, activity, or substance,</p>
<p>we are going to experience,</p>
<p>we literally achieve less dopamine release</p>
<p>each subsequent time.</p>
<p>So we get less pleasure,</p>
<p>and the amount of craving increases.</p>
<p>Now, after a certain point or threshold,</p>
<p>we call that addiction.</p>
<p>And the way to reset the balance,</p>
<p>and this is very important,</p>
<p>the way to reset the balance</p>
<p>is actually to enter into states</p>
<p>in which we are not in pursuit of pleasure,</p>
<p>to literally enter states in which we are bored,</p>
<p>maybe even a little bored and anxious,</p>
<p>and that resets the pleasure-pain balance</p>
<p>so that we can return to our pursuit of pleasure</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s healthy,</p>
<p>and that in an ongoing way won&rsquo;t lead to this overtipping</p>
<p>or this increase in the amount of pain or addiction.</p>
<p>So this is very important,</p>
<p>and if this seemed vague,</p>
<p>what this means is we should always be cautious</p>
<p>of any state of mind or body</p>
<p>or any pursuit that leads to very large increases</p>
<p>in dopamine, and if it does,</p>
<p>we should be very careful</p>
<p>to not pursue that repeatedly over time.</p>
<p>During today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to give an example,</p>
<p>a real-life example of a discussion</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been in with a young man who&rsquo;s 21 years old,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s dealing with a disruption</p>
<p>in this pleasure-pain balance.</p>
<p>He is essentially depressed,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s depressed because of his ongoing pursuit</p>
<p>of a particular activity</p>
<p>that initially led to a lot of dopamine,</p>
<p>but over time has led to less and less dopamine</p>
<p>and more and more of this pain side of the balance.</p>
<p>We could call him addicted to that particular activity.</p>
<p>Whether or not he&rsquo;s addicted by clinical standards or not</p>
<p>really isn&rsquo;t important.</p>
<p>What is important is that he experiences this as depression,</p>
<p>as low affect, as it&rsquo;s called, or anhedonia,</p>
<p>an inability to experience pleasure</p>
<p>from that thing or from anything else,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s currently undergoing treatment</p>
<p>through a rebalancing of this pleasure-pain pathway,</p>
<p>so while I can&rsquo;t reveal his identity to you,</p>
<p>that wouldn&rsquo;t be appropriate,</p>
<p>he did give me permission to reveal</p>
<p>the general architecture of what he&rsquo;s coping with,</p>
<p>and I spent some hours with him on the phone this week</p>
<p>talking to him as well as to the various people</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s working with to really understand</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on here,</p>
<p>because I think it can illustrate the relationship</p>
<p>between dopamine, pleasure, and pain for sake of addiction,</p>
<p>but also for understanding how to avoid depressive states,</p>
<p>how to remove ourselves from depressive states,</p>
<p>and as you&rsquo;ll see today, as we discuss depression,</p>
<p>many of the molecules and neural pathways</p>
<p>and biological mechanisms that we know can be used</p>
<p>to counter depression feed back</p>
<p>onto this pleasure-pain balance.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to say that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need, and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs,</p>
<p>plus a year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are in Element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase, they&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs,</p>
<p>in the sense that I don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s any one substance or collection of substances</p>
<p>that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this, and as far as I know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single-ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things</p>
<p>and remove things from your protocol</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re discussing depression.</p>
<p>In particular, we&rsquo;re going to talk about major depression.</p>
<p>The phrase major depression is used to distinguish</p>
<p>one form of depression from the other,</p>
<p>the other one being bipolar depression.</p>
<p>Bipolar depression, sometimes called bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>is really characterized by manic highs,</p>
<p>so where people aren&rsquo;t sleeping</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re talking very fast</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re buying things and pursuing resources</p>
<p>that they can&rsquo;t afford,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re starting relationships left and right,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re manic, followed by periods of crashes</p>
<p>of feeling very low, lethargic, and so on.</p>
<p>Bipolar depression is an absolutely crucial thing</p>
<p>for us to discuss, and therefore,</p>
<p>we are going to have an entire separate episode</p>
<p>related to bipolar depression.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to talk about major depression,</p>
<p>also sometimes called unipolar depression,</p>
<p>just because it doesn&rsquo;t have the highs and lows.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more characterized by the lows.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about the biology, the psychology,</p>
<p>and the various treatments, behavioral drugs,</p>
<p>supplementation, diet, exercise, all of that.</p>
<p>Before we go forward into the material,</p>
<p>I just want to emphasize that any discussion</p>
<p>about mood disorders carries with it</p>
<p>a particular sensitivity, and that sensitivity</p>
<p>is one related to self-diagnosis.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode, and indeed in the future episodes</p>
<p>for this month on mood disorders,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to hear various symptomologies</p>
<p>that are used to diagnose and characterize these disorders.</p>
<p>If you recognize some of these symptomologies in yourself</p>
<p>or in others that you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an important thing to take note of.</p>
<p>However, accurate diagnosis really should be done</p>
<p>by a qualified healthcare professional.</p>
<p>So at once, I&rsquo;m saying, keep your eyes and your ears up</p>
<p>for things that sound familiar to you</p>
<p>that might be of concern, and at the same time,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying, don&rsquo;t necessarily leap to conclusions.</p>
<p>Take those flags of concern if they&rsquo;re there</p>
<p>and bring them to a qualified healthcare professional,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll be able to properly diagnose you</p>
<p>as having a particular mood disorder</p>
<p>or diagnose somebody as having a particular mood disorder</p>
<p>or not, and that&rsquo;s an essential step.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say this to protect us,</p>
<p>I say this really to protect you.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s have a fact-based discussion about depression,</p>
<p>and I promise you that where we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>certain things about depression,</p>
<p>I will be clear to tell you.</p>
<p>In fact, we are going to talk about some treatments</p>
<p>for depression that are looking very promising</p>
<p>and that right now are actually being used more and more,</p>
<p>and from my read of the mechanistic literature,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re still a bit in the dark as to how these work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually a common theme of medicine.</p>
<p>Many times there are treatments that seem promising</p>
<p>or that look really terrific,</p>
<p>and there isn&rsquo;t a lot of understanding about mechanism.</p>
<p>However, any good discussion about neuroscience,</p>
<p>and in particular about mood disorders,</p>
<p>has to get into mechanism, so we&rsquo;re going to do that,</p>
<p>and in doing that, we&rsquo;re going to frame the discussion</p>
<p>for the tools of how to keep depression at bay</p>
<p>and how to deal with it</p>
<p>if you happen to find yourself depressed</p>
<p>or if you know somebody else who&rsquo;s depressed.</p>
<p>What is this thing we call depression?</p>
<p>Well, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>it has two forms, bipolar depression,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;re not talking about today,</p>
<p>and major depression,</p>
<p>also called unipolar depression, is the other.</p>
<p>Major depression impacts 5% of the population.</p>
<p>That is an enormous number.</p>
<p>That means if you&rsquo;re in a class of 100 people,</p>
<p>five of them are dealing with major depression</p>
<p>or have at some point.</p>
<p>Look around you in any environment,</p>
<p>and you can be sure that a good portion of the people</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re surrounded by is impacted by depression</p>
<p>or will be at some point,</p>
<p>so this is something we really have to take seriously</p>
<p>and that we want to understand.</p>
<p>It is the number four cause of disability.</p>
<p>A lot of people miss work, miss school,</p>
<p>and before then, likely perform poorly in work or school</p>
<p>due to major depression.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a very serious challenge</p>
<p>in having a discussion about depression,</p>
<p>and it relates directly to the challenges</p>
<p>in diagnosing depression.</p>
<p>Earlier, I did an episode with Dr. Karl Deisseroth,</p>
<p>who is indeed a medical doctor and a PhD.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a psychiatrist, and he made a very important point,</p>
<p>which is that the field of psychiatry and psychology</p>
<p>are confronted with a challenge,</p>
<p>which is they&rsquo;re trying to understand what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>within the stuff that&rsquo;s in our brains</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s deep to our skulls.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have access to that without brain imaging</p>
<p>and electrodes and things like that.</p>
<p>Someone just comes into the office,</p>
<p>and the dissection tool for depression,</p>
<p>so to speak, is language.</p>
<p>In order to determine if somebody has depression or not,</p>
<p>we have to use language, how they talk about things.</p>
<p>Also how they carry their body.</p>
<p>Also some general patterns of health.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about depression</p>
<p>the way that clinicians talk about depression,</p>
<p>because one of the issues is that</p>
<p>we use the word depression loosely.</p>
<p>A lot of people say, oh, you know, I&rsquo;m so depressed.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get this job, or I&rsquo;m so depressed.</p>
<p>I just, I don&rsquo;t know, I had a really rough week,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m exhausted, I&rsquo;m so depressed, or I&rsquo;m so depressed,</p>
<p>I thought I was going to go on vacation,</p>
<p>and then they canceled the flight, okay?</p>
<p>That is not clinical depression.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called being bummed out, being sad, or disappointed.</p>
<p>Now that person might be depressed,</p>
<p>but clinical depression</p>
<p>actually has some very specific criteria.</p>
<p>And those criteria are mainly characterized</p>
<p>by the presence of certain things</p>
<p>and the absence of a few particular things.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about the things that are present</p>
<p>in somebody that has major depression.</p>
<p>First of all, there tends to be a lot of grief.</p>
<p>There tends to be a lot of sadness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s no surprise.</p>
<p>The threshold to cry is often a signature of depression.</p>
<p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t mean that if you cry easily</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re depressed.</p>
<p>Some people cry more easily than others,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re somebody who typically didn&rsquo;t cry easily</p>
<p>and suddenly you find yourself crying very easily,</p>
<p>that could be a sign of depression.</p>
<p>And I want to emphasize could.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also this thing that we call anhedonia,</p>
<p>a general lack of ability to enjoy things,</p>
<p>things that typically or previously we enjoyed,</p>
<p>things like food, things like sex, things like exercise,</p>
<p>things like social gatherings,</p>
<p>a kind of lack of enjoyment from those things.</p>
<p>Sometimes that lack of enjoyment is sad.</p>
<p>And sometimes it&rsquo;s just flat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just kind of neutral.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t feel good because there&rsquo;s nothing there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like bland food.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like these experiences are analogous</p>
<p>to biting into your favorite article of food</p>
<p>and it just not tasting very good.</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t taste like anything at all.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a common symptom of major depression.</p>
<p>The other one is guilt.</p>
<p>Oftentimes people with depression will feel very guilty</p>
<p>about things they have done in the past</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ll just generally feel badly about themselves.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to talk about this</p>
<p>because it relates to some of the more serious symptomology</p>
<p>seen in depression sometimes,</p>
<p>things like self-harm, mutilation, or even suicide.</p>
<p>But for the time being, we want to frame up anhedonia,</p>
<p>this lack of ability to achieve or experience pleasure,</p>
<p>kind of a flat affect as it&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>sometimes even delusional thinking,</p>
<p>negative delusional thinking,</p>
<p>and in particular, anti-self-confabulation.</p>
<p>What is anti-self-confabulation?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, confabulation is an incredible aspect</p>
<p>of our mind and our nervous system.</p>
<p>You sometimes see other forms of confabulation</p>
<p>in people who have memory deficits,</p>
<p>either because they have brain damage</p>
<p>or they have age-related dementia.</p>
<p>A good example of this would be</p>
<p>someone with age-related dementia</p>
<p>sometimes will find themselves in a location in the house</p>
<p>and not know how they got there.</p>
<p>And if you ask them, oh, what are you doing here?</p>
<p>They will create these elaborate stories.</p>
<p>Oh, you know, I was thinking about going to the shopping</p>
<p>today and I was, you know, and I was going to take the bus</p>
<p>and then I was going to do,</p>
<p>they create these elaborate stories, they confabulate.</p>
<p>And yet that person hasn&rsquo;t left the house in weeks</p>
<p>and that person doesn&rsquo;t have a driver&rsquo;s license.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re really just creating this stuff.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not lying to get out of anything.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re confabulating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if a brain circuit that writes stories</p>
<p>just starts generating content.</p>
<p>In major depression, there&rsquo;s often a state of</p>
<p>delusional anti-self confabulation</p>
<p>where the confabulations are not directly</p>
<p>or completely linked to reality,</p>
<p>but they are ones that make the self,</p>
<p>the person describing them,</p>
<p>seem sick or in some way, not well.</p>
<p>A good example would be somebody who experiences</p>
<p>a physical injury, perhaps, maybe they break their ankle,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s an athlete,</p>
<p>and they also happen to become depressed.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll talk to them, you say, how are things going?</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s your rehab?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll go, oh, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m just,</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m getting weaker and weaker by the day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not performing well.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ll talk to the person that they&rsquo;re working with,</p>
<p>their kinesiologist or whoever the physical therapist is.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll say, no, they&rsquo;re actually really improving.</p>
<p>And I tell them they&rsquo;re improving, but somehow they&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not seeing that improvement.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not registering that improvement.</p>
<p>You notice that sometimes it&rsquo;s subtle</p>
<p>and sometimes it&rsquo;s severe, but they&rsquo;ll start confabulating.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll say, I actually heard you&rsquo;re doing much better.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting better.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re taking multiple trips around the building now</p>
<p>before you could barely get out of bed.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll say, yeah, well, basically,</p>
<p>they changed some things about the parking lot</p>
<p>that make it easier to move around.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not really me.</p>
<p>And these aren&rsquo;t people that are just explaining away</p>
<p>their accomplishments,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re trying to brush off praise.</p>
<p>They are viewing themselves and they are confabulating</p>
<p>according to a view that is very self-deprecating</p>
<p>to the point where it doesn&rsquo;t match up with reality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not what other people see,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s actually not matched up with reality.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a symptom of depression</p>
<p>that I think we don&rsquo;t often think about</p>
<p>or conceptualize enough.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just telling people, oh yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not as good as it seems, everything&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>These people really believe that.</p>
<p>And it becomes disconnected from reality.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s if they&rsquo;re sort of sinking into a pit</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re losing touch with the realities of the world,</p>
<p>including data about themselves,</p>
<p>their ability to move and get around.</p>
<p>For example, in the particular instance</p>
<p>that I used as an example, but there are others as well.</p>
<p>The other common symptomology of major depression</p>
<p>is what they call vegetative symptoms, okay?</p>
<p>So vegetative symptoms are symptoms that occur</p>
<p>without any thinking, without any doing,</p>
<p>or without any confabulation.</p>
<p>These are things that are related to our core physiology.</p>
<p>The word vegetative,</p>
<p>you might know it sounds like vegetable.</p>
<p>It actually relates to a system in the body</p>
<p>that nowadays is more commonly called</p>
<p>the autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>The vegetative nervous system</p>
<p>and the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>historically were considered sort of one in the same.</p>
<p>And it relates to things like the stress response</p>
<p>or to our ability to sleep.</p>
<p>So vegetative symptoms be things like</p>
<p>constantly being exhausted.</p>
<p>The person just feels exhausted.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not because they exercise too much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not necessarily because of a life event.</p>
<p>It could be, but they&rsquo;re just worn out.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have the energy they once had.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not in their heads.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably, and now I think we have good data</p>
<p>to support the fact that there&rsquo;s something off.</p>
<p>Something is disrupted in the autonomic</p>
<p>or so-called vegetative nervous system.</p>
<p>And one of the most common symptoms</p>
<p>of people with major depression,</p>
<p>one of the signs of major depression is early waking</p>
<p>and not being able to fall back asleep</p>
<p>despite being exhausted.</p>
<p>So waking up at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. or 5 a.m.</p>
<p>just spontaneously and not being able to go back to sleep.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that that could happen</p>
<p>for other reasons as well,</p>
<p>but it is a common symptom or warning sign</p>
<p>of major depression.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk more about sleep and depression.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s well known that the architecture of sleep</p>
<p>is disrupted in depression.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the architecture of sleep?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done entire episodes about this,</p>
<p>but very briefly in two sentences,</p>
<p>although there&rsquo;ll probably be run on sentences.</p>
<p>Early in the night, you tend to have slow wave sleep</p>
<p>more than REM sleep or rapid eye movement sleep.</p>
<p>As the night goes on,</p>
<p>you tend to have more rapid eye movement sleep.</p>
<p>That architecture of slow wave sleep</p>
<p>preceding rapid eye movement sleep</p>
<p>is radically disrupted in major depression.</p>
<p>In addition, the pattern of activity in the brain</p>
<p>during particular phases of sleep is disrupted.</p>
<p>Now this is during sleep.</p>
<p>So this can&rsquo;t be that people are creating this situation</p>
<p>for themselves.</p>
<p>These are real physiological signs</p>
<p>that something is off in this so-called autonomic</p>
<p>or vegetative nervous system.</p>
<p>And then there are some other things that relate</p>
<p>to the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>but that we normally think of as more voluntary in nature.</p>
<p>And these are things like decreased appetite.</p>
<p>So you could imagine that one could have decreased appetite</p>
<p>because of the anhedonia, the lack of pleasure from food.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t enjoy food,</p>
<p>then you might be less motivated to eat it.</p>
<p>That makes sense.</p>
<p>As well, because of these disruptions</p>
<p>in the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>these vegetative symptoms as they&rsquo;re called,</p>
<p>you can imagine that someone would have decreased appetite</p>
<p>because some of the hormones associated with appetite,</p>
<p>hypocretinorexin and things of that sort,</p>
<p>ghrelin, that those would be disrupted.</p>
<p>And if those names of hypocretinorexin and ghrelin</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t make any sense to you, don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>What those are just hormones that impact when we eat,</p>
<p>when we feel hungry, and when we crave food more,</p>
<p>as well as when we feel full,</p>
<p>we have enough so-called satiety.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about those,</p>
<p>we did entire episodes on eating and metabolism.</p>
<p>So you can see that the symptomology of major depression</p>
<p>impacts us at multiple levels.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the conscious level</p>
<p>of how excited we are generally.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s reduced.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s grief, there&rsquo;s guilt, there&rsquo;s crying.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s also these vegetative things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s disruptions in sleep,</p>
<p>which of course make everything more challenging</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re awake.</p>
<p>We know that sleep is so vital for resetting.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re waking up early, you can&rsquo;t get back to sleep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to read, that&rsquo;s going to adjust your affect,</p>
<p>your emotions in negative ways.</p>
<p>We know this.</p>
<p>And appetite is off.</p>
<p>And there are hormones that get disrupted.</p>
<p>So cortisol levels are increased.</p>
<p>In particular, there&rsquo;s a signature pattern of depression</p>
<p>whereby cortisol, this stress hormone</p>
<p>that normally is released in a healthy way,</p>
<p>only in the early part of the day,</p>
<p>is shifted to late in the day.</p>
<p>In fact, a 9 p.m. peak in cortisol</p>
<p>is one of the physiological signatures</p>
<p>of depressive-like states.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the only one, but it is an important one.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of things going on in major depression.</p>
<p>And by now you&rsquo;re probably thinking,</p>
<p>oh goodness, this is dreadful.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s all this terrible stuff.</p>
<p>And indeed it is terrible.</p>
<p>It is a terrible thing to find oneself</p>
<p>in a mode where things feel sad,</p>
<p>you feel guilty, you&rsquo;re exhausted.</p>
<p>And oftentimes there&rsquo;s also an association</p>
<p>with the anxiety system.</p>
<p>So just because people are exhausted and lethargic</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t enjoy things doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s an absence of anxiety.</p>
<p>There can also be a lot of anxiety</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s going to happen to me.</p>
<p>Am I going to be able to achieve my goals in life?</p>
<p>Will I ever get out of this state?</p>
<p>And so things really start to layer on.</p>
<p>And if this sounds depressing to you,</p>
<p>it is indeed depressing.</p>
<p>This is really the place that many people find themselves.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a pit that they just don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how to climb out of.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just take a few minutes</p>
<p>and talk about some of the underlying biology</p>
<p>that creates this cloud</p>
<p>or this constellation of symptomology.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s really important to do</p>
<p>because if we want to understand the various treatments,</p>
<p>how they work and why they work and how to implement them,</p>
<p>we have to understand some of the underlying biology.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s spend a few minutes talking about</p>
<p>the biology of depression.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s known, what&rsquo;s not known.</p>
<p>Because in doing that,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ll get a much clearer picture</p>
<p>about why certain tools work to relieve depression</p>
<p>and why others might not.</p>
<p>So one of the most important early findings</p>
<p>in the search for a biological basis of depression</p>
<p>was this finding that there are drugs</p>
<p>that relieve some of the symptoms of depression.</p>
<p>Those drugs generally fall into three major categories,</p>
<p>but the first set of ones that were discovered</p>
<p>were the so-called tricyclic antidepressants</p>
<p>and the MAO inhibitors, the monoamine oxidase inhibitors.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to understand that nomenclature,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to give you a little bit of detail</p>
<p>so that if you want to understand it, you can.</p>
<p>Most of this work took place in the late 1950s</p>
<p>and in the 1960s and continued well until the 1980s</p>
<p>when new classes of drugs were discovered.</p>
<p>And these tricyclic antidepressants and the MAO inhibitors</p>
<p>largely worked by increasing levels of norepinephrine</p>
<p>in the brain, as well as in the body in some cases.</p>
<p>And they were discovered through a kind of</p>
<p>odd set of circumstances.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have time to go into all the history,</p>
<p>but suffice to say that they were discovered</p>
<p>because of the exploration for drugs</p>
<p>that alter blood pressure.</p>
<p>Norepinephrine impacts blood pressure</p>
<p>and drugs that lower blood pressure</p>
<p>reduce levels of norepinephrine.</p>
<p>And that in many cases was shown to lead to depression</p>
<p>or depressive-like symptoms.</p>
<p>And so these drugs, these tricyclic drugs</p>
<p>and the MAO inhibitors actually increased norepinephrine</p>
<p>and frankly, they do quite a good job of relieving some,</p>
<p>if not all of the symptoms of major depression.</p>
<p>However, they carry with them many side effects.</p>
<p>Some of those side effects are side effects</p>
<p>related to blood pressure itself</p>
<p>by increasing noradrenaline, norepinephrine as it&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>you raise blood pressure.</p>
<p>That can be dangerous.</p>
<p>That can be uncomfortable,</p>
<p>but they also have a lot of other side effects.</p>
<p>The reason they have other side effects</p>
<p>is because they impact systems in the brain</p>
<p>and in the body that impact things like libido,</p>
<p>appetite, digestion, and others.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about each of those in sequence.</p>
<p>Okay, so the experience that clinicians had</p>
<p>of observing some relief for depression</p>
<p>with the tricyclic antidepressants</p>
<p>and with MAO inhibitors was terrific,</p>
<p>but there were all these side effects.</p>
<p>Side effects that people really did not like.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t like these drugs at all.</p>
<p>A lot of people get dry mouth.</p>
<p>I mentioned the low libido.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d have sleep issues, appetite issues,</p>
<p>weight gain.</p>
<p>They made some people so uncomfortable</p>
<p>that they preferred not to take them,</p>
<p>even though when they didn&rsquo;t take them,</p>
<p>they had a worsening or a maintenance</p>
<p>of their depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>A decade or so later,</p>
<p>there was the discovery</p>
<p>of the so-called pleasure pathways in the brain.</p>
<p>These are pathways, literally groups of neurons</p>
<p>that reside in different locations in the brain,</p>
<p>but connect to one another.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a circuit.</p>
<p>And when you stimulate these neurons</p>
<p>with certain behaviors</p>
<p>or with electrical stimulation in an experiment,</p>
<p>believe it or not,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been done in both animals and humans.</p>
<p>Animals and humans become very, very motivated</p>
<p>to get more stimulation of these pathways.</p>
<p>So this pleasure pathway</p>
<p>or these circuits for pleasure</p>
<p>are very what we call reinforcing.</p>
<p>In fact, animals and humans will work hard</p>
<p>to get stimulation of these brain areas</p>
<p>even more than they will work to obtain sex, drugs,</p>
<p>or even if they are addicted to a particular drug</p>
<p>and they are in a state of withdrawal,</p>
<p>the ultimate state of craving.</p>
<p>If given a choice, a person or an animal</p>
<p>will select to have stimulation of this pleasure pathway</p>
<p>instead of the drug itself.</p>
<p>And that is a major and significant finding.</p>
<p>This pleasure pathway, as it&rsquo;s sometimes called,</p>
<p>involves areas like the nucleus accumbens</p>
<p>and the ventral tegmental area.</p>
<p>These are areas of the brain</p>
<p>that are rich with neurons that make dopamine.</p>
<p>And if you think to the symptoms of depression,</p>
<p>of anhedonia, a lack of pleasure,</p>
<p>a lack of ability to experience pleasure,</p>
<p>well, that was a smoking gun</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something wrong</p>
<p>with the dopamine pathway in depression.</p>
<p>And indeed that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just norepinephrine,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also the dopamine or pleasure pathway</p>
<p>is somehow disrupted.</p>
<p>And then in the 1980s,</p>
<p>there was the discovery of the so-called SSRIs.</p>
<p>Most people are now familiar with the SSRIs,</p>
<p>the Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors.</p>
<p>The SSRIs worked by distinct mechanisms</p>
<p>from the tricyclic antidepressants and the MAO inhibitors.</p>
<p>As their name suggests, SSRIs,</p>
<p>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors,</p>
<p>prevent serotonin from being wiped up from the synapse</p>
<p>after two neurons talk to one another.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s some very basic neurobiology 101.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know any neurobiology,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to know some in about 15 seconds.</p>
<p>Neurons communicate with one another</p>
<p>by spitting out chemicals into the little gap between them.</p>
<p>The little gap between them is called the synapse</p>
<p>or by the Brits, the synapse.</p>
<p>Those chemicals bind to the neuron on the opposite side</p>
<p>and cause changes in the electrical activity</p>
<p>of that neuron on the other side of the synapse.</p>
<p>Serotonin is one such neurotransmitter</p>
<p>or more specifically, it&rsquo;s a neuromodulator.</p>
<p>It can change the activity of large groups of neurons</p>
<p>in very meaningful ways.</p>
<p>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor</p>
<p>means when a person takes this drug,</p>
<p>some of those drugs include things like Prozac or Zoloft,</p>
<p>the more typical names or more generic names</p>
<p>are things like fluoxetine.</p>
<p>When people take those,</p>
<p>more serotonin hangs out in the synapse</p>
<p>and is able to be taken up by the neuron on the opposite side</p>
<p>because of this selective reuptake inhibition.</p>
<p>It prevents the clearance of serotonin from the synapse</p>
<p>and thereby more serotonin can have an effect.</p>
<p>So SSRIs don&rsquo;t increase the total amount of serotonin</p>
<p>in the brain.</p>
<p>They change how effective the serotonin</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s already in the brain</p>
<p>is at changing the activity of neurons, okay?</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t increase serotonin,</p>
<p>they increase the efficacy or the function of serotonin</p>
<p>in the way that I just described.</p>
<p>So that was more than 15 seconds,</p>
<p>but now you understand how SSRIs work.</p>
<p>And I wouldn&rsquo;t be talking about SSRIs</p>
<p>if they didn&rsquo;t in fact work.</p>
<p>Yes, there are many problems with SSRIs.</p>
<p>They do carry certain side effects in many individuals.</p>
<p>Also, about a third of people that take SSRIs</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t derive any benefit.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t relieve their symptoms of depression.</p>
<p>However, for the other two thirds,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s often a relief of some,</p>
<p>if not all of the symptoms of major depression.</p>
<p>The problem is the side effects that accompany those SSRIs.</p>
<p>And so these days SSRIs are a complicated topic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of what I would call a barbed wire topic</p>
<p>because we often hear about all the problems with them,</p>
<p>but these drugs also have saved a lot of lives.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve also improved a lot of lives.</p>
<p>The issue is that they tend to have varying effects</p>
<p>on different individuals</p>
<p>and sometimes varying effects over time.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll work for a while,</p>
<p>then they won&rsquo;t work for a while.</p>
<p>There are also a lot of mysteries about the SSRIs.</p>
<p>And those mysteries bother people.</p>
<p>What mysteries am I referring to?</p>
<p>Well, SSRIs increase the amount of serotonin</p>
<p>or more specifically,</p>
<p>they increase the efficacy of serotonin at the synapse.</p>
<p>That happens immediately</p>
<p>or very soon after people start taking SSRIs,</p>
<p>but people generally don&rsquo;t start experiencing any relief</p>
<p>from their symptoms of depression</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re going to experience them at all</p>
<p>until about two weeks after they start taking these drugs.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something going on there that&rsquo;s not clear.</p>
<p>One idea is that the SSRIs</p>
<p>actually can improve symptoms of depression</p>
<p>or even remove symptoms of depression</p>
<p>through so-called neuroplasticity</p>
<p>by changing the way that neural circuits function.</p>
<p>And there are many studies on this,</p>
<p>but the main categories of studies on SSRIs</p>
<p>that relate to neuroplasticity fall into two camps.</p>
<p>One is the ways in which SSRIs might,</p>
<p>and I want to emphasize might,</p>
<p>be able to trigger the production of more neurons</p>
<p>in the brain, in particular areas of the hippocampus</p>
<p>called the dentate gyrus and others that impact memory.</p>
<p>This is important.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to come back to memory.</p>
<p>The other is that the SSRIs have been shown</p>
<p>in various scientific studies</p>
<p>to reopen critical periods of plasticity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just briefly describe one of those studies.</p>
<p>It was a study done by Lamberto Maffei&rsquo;s group in Pisa</p>
<p>that explored brain plasticity</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s known to be present in young animals</p>
<p>and disappear in older animals.</p>
<p>And this is also true in humans.</p>
<p>Younger humans have a far more plastic brain.</p>
<p>It can change in many more ways,</p>
<p>more easily than can the older brain.</p>
<p>And what they showed was that fluoxetine, Prozac,</p>
<p>given to adult animals</p>
<p>can reopen this incredible period of plasticity,</p>
<p>can allow more plasticity to occur.</p>
<p>That was interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s purely through increases</p>
<p>in serotonin transmission.</p>
<p>And there are other studies showing</p>
<p>that fluoxetine can increase the number of new neurons</p>
<p>that are born into the adult brain,</p>
<p>so-called neurogenesis, the production of new neurons.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very clear that there are at least</p>
<p>three major chemical systems in the brain,</p>
<p>norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin</p>
<p>that relate to and can adjust the symptoms of depression.</p>
<p>And those actually can be divided into separate categories.</p>
<p>So for instance, epinephrine or norepinephrine</p>
<p>is thought to relate to the so-called psychomotor defects,</p>
<p>sometimes called psychomotor retardation.</p>
<p>This is the lethargy.</p>
<p>This is the exhaustion.</p>
<p>This is the inability to get out of bed in the morning.</p>
<p>Dopamine is thought to relate to the anhedonia,</p>
<p>or I should say lack of dopamine in depressive patients</p>
<p>is thought to lead to the anhedonia,</p>
<p>the lack of ability to experience pleasure.</p>
<p>And serotonin is thought to relate to the grief, the guilt,</p>
<p>some of the more cognitive</p>
<p>or more emotional aspects of depression.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got the norepinephrine system</p>
<p>related to activity and alertness,</p>
<p>the dopamine system relating to motivation, pleasure,</p>
<p>and the ability to seek and experience pleasure,</p>
<p>and then the serotonin system that&rsquo;s related to grief.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, brains and organisms don&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>in a simple mathematical way where you just say,</p>
<p>oh, well, this person&rsquo;s experiencing a lot of grief,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t have any problems with lethargy,</p>
<p>and so let&rsquo;s just boost up their serotonin.</p>
<p>On paper, it works,</p>
<p>but oftentimes it doesn&rsquo;t work clinically.</p>
<p>And in another patient,</p>
<p>you might get somebody who can&rsquo;t experience pleasure,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re kind of anxious.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have any trouble sleeping,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re just much more anxious</p>
<p>and frustrated than they normally are,</p>
<p>and they meet the symptoms of depression.</p>
<p>Well, you might think, oh, well,</p>
<p>you just give that person some drug to increase dopamine</p>
<p>and everything will be better,</p>
<p>and indeed, in some cases, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>There are drugs like Welbutrin,</p>
<p>which function more specifically on the dopamine system</p>
<p>to increase dopamine,</p>
<p>and they also increase norepinephrine.</p>
<p>Many people get great relief from things like Welbutrin.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t really impact the serotonin system so much,</p>
<p>and therefore you don&rsquo;t get a lot of the serotonergic</p>
<p>or serotonin-related side effects.</p>
<p>However, some people feel far too anxious on those drugs.</p>
<p>Some people get addicted to those drugs in a way</p>
<p>because a lot of those drugs that increase dopamine</p>
<p>make you want more of those drugs.</p>
<p>So you start to realize that what makes sense on paper</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t always make sense clinically,</p>
<p>and this is why it&rsquo;s complicated,</p>
<p>and a really good psychologist</p>
<p>and a really good psychiatrist</p>
<p>will work with someone to try and pull and push</p>
<p>on these various systems to find the combination of drugs</p>
<p>that may be or may not be correct for them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fourth aspect of the chemistry of depression</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really important to understand, and that&rsquo;s pain.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about pain on this podcast before,</p>
<p>but even if you didn&rsquo;t hear the episode on pleasure and pain,</p>
<p>I just want to emphasize that pain is something</p>
<p>that we experience in our body, no surprise there,</p>
<p>an injury, a cut, et cetera,</p>
<p>but that we also experience emotional pain,</p>
<p>and those systems are linked in very intricate ways.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually some data showing that pain relievers,</p>
<p>Tylenol, aspirin, these sorts of things,</p>
<p>can help certain people with emotional pain.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not recommending people run out</p>
<p>and take those things for emotional pain,</p>
<p>but actually, if you think about that,</p>
<p>it shouldn&rsquo;t come as any surprise,</p>
<p>given the enormous number of people that take painkillers,</p>
<p>opioids, and things like them,</p>
<p>to try and relieve their psychological pain,</p>
<p>and as we know, those drugs are very, very problematic</p>
<p>for many individuals.</p>
<p>They can help certain individuals,</p>
<p>but they are very prone to abuse,</p>
<p>and they can induce addiction very easily</p>
<p>in a number of people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a substance that&rsquo;s literally called substance P,</p>
<p>the letter P, that&rsquo;s manufactured by neurons</p>
<p>in our brain and body,</p>
<p>which underlies our sensation of pain,</p>
<p>and indeed, substance P inhibitors have been used</p>
<p>to treat depression, and in some cases, works.</p>
<p>A lot of people with depression are hypersensitive to pain,</p>
<p>and of course, they could have multiple things going on.</p>
<p>They could have chronic pain or chronic injury</p>
<p>and major depression.</p>
<p>So you start to get the constellation</p>
<p>of the many things that could happen.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s all I want to say today</p>
<p>about the chemistry underlying depression</p>
<p>or major depression.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more there,</p>
<p>but I think if you understand the norepinephrine system</p>
<p>and that it relates to some of these things like lethargy,</p>
<p>the psychomotor defects, as they&rsquo;re called,</p>
<p>dopamine and how it relates to motivation</p>
<p>and lack of motivation and lack of dopamine in depression,</p>
<p>and serotonin and its relationship to grief,</p>
<p>and that low serotonin can lead to extreme grief and shame,</p>
<p>and higher serotonin levels can sometimes restore</p>
<p>a sense of wellbeing and safety</p>
<p>and feeling good about oneself.</p>
<p>If you understand that and you understand</p>
<p>that physical pain is somehow involved in certain cases,</p>
<p>I think you will know more about depression</p>
<p>and its underlying chemistry than most all people out there.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;d like to learn more,</p>
<p>I invite you to pursue searching those terms</p>
<p>further on the internet,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll certainly go into them in more depth,</p>
<p>but that really sets the stage for where we&rsquo;re headed next.</p>
<p>So next, I&rsquo;d like to talk about hormones</p>
<p>and how they relate to depression.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d also like to talk about stress</p>
<p>and how it relates to depression,</p>
<p>as well as talk about some of the genetics</p>
<p>or the predispositions to depression.</p>
<p>And for those of you that are thinking,</p>
<p>hey, I want the tools, I want to know how to fix depression,</p>
<p>I understand the desire for that.</p>
<p>I will just ask if you hang in here with me</p>
<p>a little bit longer,</p>
<p>not only will you learn a lot more</p>
<p>about how this complicated mood disorder works,</p>
<p>some of the more interesting things about it,</p>
<p>but it will also position you to get a lot more</p>
<p>out of the tools that we will describe.</p>
<p>You always have the option to skip forward, of course,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s important to understand</p>
<p>some of the hormonal and stress-related aspects</p>
<p>of depression.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about hormones.</p>
<p>20% of people that have major depression</p>
<p>have low thyroid hormone.</p>
<p>Thyroid hormone is related to metabolism.</p>
<p>Oftentimes we think about thyroid as only related to,</p>
<p>you know, having a fast metabolism,</p>
<p>but thyroid is related to all forms of metabolism,</p>
<p>including our ability to synthesize new tissues</p>
<p>like protein and repair injuries.</p>
<p>I did a whole episode on thyroid and growth hormone.</p>
<p>If you want to check that out,</p>
<p>all of that is archived at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all timestamped, et cetera.</p>
<p>You can find on YouTube, Apple, Spotify, all those places.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re curious about thyroid hormone</p>
<p>and growth hormone,</p>
<p>and you want to do the deep dive on those,</p>
<p>and you want to learn how to alter their levels</p>
<p>using various approaches, check that out.</p>
<p>But 20% of people with major depression are hypothyroidal.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t make enough thyroid,</p>
<p>and that leads to low energy,</p>
<p>low metabolism in the brain and body.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a condition called Hashimoto&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>which is essentially low thyroid output.</p>
<p>And again, I don&rsquo;t want to get into</p>
<p>all the tools related to thyroid.</p>
<p>Sometimes a psychiatrist will prescribe thyroid medication</p>
<p>to increase thyroid output in people that are depressed,</p>
<p>and that will work to relieve the symptoms.</p>
<p>So there isn&rsquo;t necessarily a direct problem</p>
<p>with serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine</p>
<p>or substance abuse.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s a thyroid problem.</p>
<p>So there are certain situations or conditions</p>
<p>that can impact the thyroid hormone system</p>
<p>and make people more susceptible to depression</p>
<p>or make a preexisting depression worse.</p>
<p>And those are things like childbirth.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s well-known that women who give birth</p>
<p>can often undergo what&rsquo;s called postpartum depression.</p>
<p>It actually comes from the word post-partuition depression.</p>
<p>They give birth, what&rsquo;s happier,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s more joyful than the birth of a new healthy child,</p>
<p>and they will lapse into a depression,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s thought to be hormonally related.</p>
<p>Either directly to the thyroid system</p>
<p>or perhaps to the cortisol system as well.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about cortisol in a moment.</p>
<p>As well, women during certain phases</p>
<p>of their menstrual cycle experience symptoms</p>
<p>that are very much like clinical depression</p>
<p>and oftentimes are diagnosed</p>
<p>with clinical depression appropriately.</p>
<p>And of course, the menstrual cycle is associated</p>
<p>with shifts in hormone levels.</p>
<p>As well, menopause and post-menopausal women</p>
<p>are more susceptible to major depression</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve had that major depression earlier in their life.</p>
<p>So these are things to be on the lookout for</p>
<p>and to definitely talk to a doctor</p>
<p>and get a blood panel that hopefully includes measures</p>
<p>of thyroid hormone and cortisol hormone.</p>
<p>Why cortisol hormone?</p>
<p>Well, more stress is correlated with more bouts</p>
<p>of major depression across the lifespan.</p>
<p>How many bouts?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that as you go from having one</p>
<p>to two to three, well, when you hit four to five bouts</p>
<p>of really intense to stressful episodes in life,</p>
<p>these tend to be long-term stressful episodes,</p>
<p>your risk for major depression goes way up.</p>
<p>So whether or not you have a genetic predisposition</p>
<p>to depression or not,</p>
<p>one of the best things you can do</p>
<p>to try and avoid getting depressed</p>
<p>is to learn to control your stress system,</p>
<p>to not go from short-term stress,</p>
<p>which everybody experiences,</p>
<p>we all have short-term stressors,</p>
<p>to medium-term stress, to long-term stress,</p>
<p>and to not have too many bouts of long-term stress</p>
<p>because that probability of getting depressed</p>
<p>goes way, way up.</p>
<p>And this is something I&rsquo;ve seen over and over again,</p>
<p>not just in my scientific career, but just throughout life,</p>
<p>people in all sorts of domains, young and old,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen that people will go</p>
<p>through a very intense relationship, a breakup,</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s the staying together that&rsquo;s stressful,</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s a graduate school that can be stressful,</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s some other event,</p>
<p>and then some months later, they become depressed.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because the stress system is associated</p>
<p>with the release of cortisol.</p>
<p>The cortisol system can dramatically impact</p>
<p>the way that these different neuromodulators,</p>
<p>dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin function.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s this kind of latent</p>
<p>or longer lasting impact on the systems</p>
<p>that impact mood and wellbeing.</p>
<p>So learning how to control your stress is really key.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not depressed,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re somebody that has not lapsed</p>
<p>into a depression recently,</p>
<p>take control of your stress system.</p>
<p>And we did an entire episode on how to conquer stress,</p>
<p>and that involves dealing with stress in the short-term,</p>
<p>in the medium-term, and in the long-term.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of different ways to do that.</p>
<p>One of the more important reasons</p>
<p>for learning how to counter stress</p>
<p>in order to offset depression</p>
<p>is that there is a genetic predisposition</p>
<p>that certain people carry to become depressed.</p>
<p>There are these studies now</p>
<p>of many, many thousands of individuals.</p>
<p>These were mainly done in New Zealand,</p>
<p>but these studies have now been done elsewhere,</p>
<p>looking at many tens of thousands of individuals</p>
<p>who carry particular copies of genes,</p>
<p>what they call polymorphisms,</p>
<p>in particular of a gene called 5-HTT-LPR,</p>
<p>which is a serotonin transporter.</p>
<p>So this is a gene that controls or regulates</p>
<p>how much serotonin is available in the brain.</p>
<p>If you have this gene, this polymorphism,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that you will be depressed,</p>
<p>but it greatly shifts your susceptibility</p>
<p>to depression under conditions of stress.</p>
<p>So I realize some people are listening to this,</p>
<p>and some people are watching it on YouTube.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to describe this in a way</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t require looking at any graphs.</p>
<p>What I want you to imagine is a very shallow hill,</p>
<p>like a very mellow hill.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a ramp set at about 10 or 15 degrees, okay?</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re plotting there in your mind</p>
<p>is that with each bout of serious stress,</p>
<p>so that could be trying to finish a degree</p>
<p>or a relationship breakup or a family member that&rsquo;s sick</p>
<p>or the loss of a loved one or a pet,</p>
<p>with each bout of stress,</p>
<p>the probability that you will experience</p>
<p>a major depression goes up.</p>
<p>However, if you carry this gene, this HTT-LPR gene,</p>
<p>the steepness of that curve goes way, way up,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s actually more like a line,</p>
<p>such that you need far fewer bouts of stress</p>
<p>in order to lapse into a major depression, okay?</p>
<p>So if the typical person who doesn&rsquo;t carry this polymorphism</p>
<p>has to experience two or three or four or five bouts</p>
<p>of stress before they lapse into a depression,</p>
<p>somebody with this gene is susceptible</p>
<p>to getting depression after just one bout</p>
<p>or two bouts of intense stress, okay?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how these genes work.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t preordain or determine you to be depressed.</p>
<p>They raise a susceptibility.</p>
<p>And many genes, many things related to heritability</p>
<p>in general work in that way.</p>
<p>And we know there&rsquo;s a strong genetic component</p>
<p>to depression.</p>
<p>How do we know?</p>
<p>Well, in what are called concordant monozygotic twins.</p>
<p>So these will be identical twins,</p>
<p>and they can either be in one biological sac</p>
<p>or two biological sacs while in utero.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s called monochorionic or dichorionic.</p>
<p>Well, typically it&rsquo;s monochorionic and identical twins</p>
<p>for which one of those twins goes on</p>
<p>to have major depression,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a 50% probability that the other one</p>
<p>will have major depression.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not 100%.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not 100% inherited.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not 100% genetic, as you might say,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a much higher predisposition for depression.</p>
<p>Whereas in fraternal twins, that number drops.</p>
<p>And in siblings, that number drops to about 25%.</p>
<p>And in half siblings, it&rsquo;s about 10%.</p>
<p>The numbers vary from study to study.</p>
<p>But basically the more closely related you are</p>
<p>to somebody who has major depression,</p>
<p>the more likely it is that you will also</p>
<p>get major depression.</p>
<p>And therefore, if you haven&rsquo;t gotten major depression,</p>
<p>the more likely it is that you should take steps</p>
<p>to learn to mitigate stress,</p>
<p>because stress is the major factor that can trigger</p>
<p>one of these depressive episodes.</p>
<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;ve covered a lot related to the stress</p>
<p>and the hormones and the neurochemistry of depression.</p>
<p>In fact, I think this is probably the deepest</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever gone into the biology of any topic</p>
<p>on this podcast before getting to any specific tools.</p>
<p>I mentioned that learning how to mitigate stress</p>
<p>and deal with stress, learning how to measure</p>
<p>and adjust your thyroid hormone, those might be useful.</p>
<p>But next I&rsquo;d like to turn to some very specific tools</p>
<p>that people who both have depression</p>
<p>or who are prone to depression,</p>
<p>as well as people who don&rsquo;t have depression</p>
<p>and simply want to maintain a good mood,</p>
<p>who want to maintain a positive affect</p>
<p>and pursuit of things in life.</p>
<p>What are the things that you can do?</p>
<p>Turns out there are things that you can do.</p>
<p>And all of the biology that underlies the utility</p>
<p>of those things, meaning the reasons those things work</p>
<p>will now make sense to you,</p>
<p>because they adjust things like serotonin and dopamine,</p>
<p>and they adjust them through very specific pathways.</p>
<p>I know for many people learning about mechanism</p>
<p>is kind of grueling.</p>
<p>I realized this podcast isn&rsquo;t necessarily one</p>
<p>that you can listen to passively while doing other things.</p>
<p>Although I would hope that you could do that</p>
<p>and still enjoy it and extract the information.</p>
<p>Why mechanism?</p>
<p>Mechanism is so key because mechanism is a little bit</p>
<p>like understanding some of the chemistry of cooking.</p>
<p>If you read a recipe and you can follow a recipe,</p>
<p>you often hear people say, oh, I can follow a recipe.</p>
<p>That means that if you have every ingredient</p>
<p>in that recipe, you&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>You likely can make that dish.</p>
<p>You can make that meal.</p>
<p>However, if you understand a little bit of the chemistry</p>
<p>of why salt has to be added third and not first,</p>
<p>or why the heat has to be adjusted at a particular time,</p>
<p>well, then not only can you follow a recipe,</p>
<p>but that also gives you flexibility</p>
<p>for when salt isn&rsquo;t available,</p>
<p>or when you want to adjust the flavor of the dish,</p>
<p>or when you want to try a new dish</p>
<p>or you want to get experimental.</p>
<p>So when you understand mechanism,</p>
<p>it puts you in a tremendous place of power</p>
<p>to work with your system.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just plug and chug,</p>
<p>like take 12 milligrams of this,</p>
<p>you either feel better or you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You can really start to understand how prescription drugs,</p>
<p>supplements, nutrition, behavioral tools,</p>
<p>how those things weave together</p>
<p>to either work for you or not work for you</p>
<p>and get you to paths of healthy mind and body.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s think about why any tool would work</p>
<p>to relieve depression.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about how some of the drugs</p>
<p>that impact these different chemical systems might work</p>
<p>and why they create some of the problems they create.</p>
<p>Problems are mainly created by the fact</p>
<p>that they impact lots of systems in the brain and body.</p>
<p>So you take a drug to increase serotonin,</p>
<p>but that serotonin is also related not just to mood,</p>
<p>but to things related to libido and appetite.</p>
<p>And so you start disrupting multiple systems.</p>
<p>You know, the same could be said for behavioral tools,</p>
<p>right, that any behavioral tool</p>
<p>that adjusts the levels of a particular chemical</p>
<p>ought to perhaps provide some relief</p>
<p>for some of the symptoms of major depression.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take an example that I&rsquo;ve talked about before</p>
<p>on the podcast, which is if you get into a very cold shower,</p>
<p>you take an ice bath,</p>
<p>you will release norepinephrine and epinephrine</p>
<p>in your brain and body.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question about that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone can really escape that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a kind of a universal response to being in cold water.</p>
<p>Well, if some aspects of depression</p>
<p>are related to low levels of norepinephrine,</p>
<p>will taking cold showers relieve your depression?</p>
<p>Perhaps it might even relieve certain aspects</p>
<p>of that depression.</p>
<p>Is it a cure?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s going to depend on the individual.</p>
<p>Will exercise help?</p>
<p>Well, if you go out for a run,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to increase the amount of norepinephrine</p>
<p>in your body.</p>
<p>If you enjoy that run,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s likely that you&rsquo;ll increase the levels of dopamine</p>
<p>and probably serotonin in your brain and body as well.</p>
<p>Will that cure your depression?</p>
<p>Well, there are a lot of studies exploring</p>
<p>how exercise can impact depression.</p>
<p>And indeed, regular exercise is known to be</p>
<p>a protective behavior against depression.</p>
<p>But it also can help relieve</p>
<p>some of the symptoms of depression.</p>
<p>So you may ask yourself, why would you need drugs at all?</p>
<p>Why would there be prescription drugs</p>
<p>or the need for supplementation or other things</p>
<p>to alleviate the symptoms of depression?</p>
<p>Ah, well, that&rsquo;s the diabolical nature of depression,</p>
<p>which is if people are far enough along in this thing,</p>
<p>this sometimes called disease, sometimes called disorder,</p>
<p>but major depression, oftentimes they can&rsquo;t get the energy</p>
<p>to even get up and take a bath or a shower.</p>
<p>They have no motivation to do it.</p>
<p>They have no desire to go for a run.</p>
<p>So you say, come on, let&rsquo;s go, you&rsquo;ll feel better.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;ll feel better.</p>
<p>It generates all these chemicals.</p>
<p>I heard on the whatever podcast,</p>
<p>Huberman Lab podcast or another podcast</p>
<p>that getting into action does all these things</p>
<p>and they just don&rsquo;t want to do it.</p>
<p>And to you, a person who&rsquo;s not experiencing depression,</p>
<p>that perhaps could just seem like the most frustrating</p>
<p>and confusing thing in the world.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very important to highlight the fact</p>
<p>that these circuits that are accessible to some of us,</p>
<p>the circuits for happiness, for pursuit of pleasure,</p>
<p>for exercise, for getting in a cold shower,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s your thing,</p>
<p>that those circuits are present in all people.</p>
<p>But for certain people that are experiencing</p>
<p>major depression and are really in the depths</p>
<p>of their depression,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t really access those circuits in the same way</p>
<p>that people who are not suffering from depression can.</p>
<p>So I hope that makes it clear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not offering any excuses for them.</p>
<p>And indeed, I think those behaviors would help</p>
<p>jolt them out of some of the symptomology of depression,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re just not accessible to everybody.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about the things that people can do</p>
<p>to deal with depression.</p>
<p>And again, anytime you add a behavior or a tool</p>
<p>or a supplement or subtract a behavior tool,</p>
<p>supplement, drug, et cetera,</p>
<p>you absolutely should talk to your physician,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re somebody</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s dealing with major depression.</p>
<p>I want to focus on the stress system.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not just going to tell you</p>
<p>to get sunlight in your eyes and to get a good night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>Although I think everybody should do that</p>
<p>on a regular basis, ideally every day.</p>
<p>Talked about those ad nauseum on this podcast.</p>
<p>They will help your sleep.</p>
<p>They will help you alleviate stress.</p>
<p>I think you should have tools to deal with stress</p>
<p>in real time, et cetera.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s look at depression from the standpoint</p>
<p>of a deeper biological phenomenon,</p>
<p>which is inflammation and the immune system.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s growing evidence now</p>
<p>that many forms of major depression,</p>
<p>if not all of them, relate to excessive inflammation.</p>
<p>Now, inflammation plays an important role in wound healing</p>
<p>is that it is a positive aspect of our immune system,</p>
<p>our ability to combat wounds, combat illnesses, et cetera.</p>
<p>But inflammation gone unchecked,</p>
<p>inflammation that lasts too long</p>
<p>or is of too high amplitude,</p>
<p>meaning too many anti-inflammatory or inflammatory cytokines</p>
<p>and things of that sort in the body is bad.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s decent evidence now</p>
<p>that inflammation can lead to or exacerbate depression.</p>
<p>And that if we want to control depression</p>
<p>or limit or eliminate depression,</p>
<p>that focusing on reducing inflammation</p>
<p>and its associated pathways is a really good thing to do.</p>
<p>And I think this is a really good thing</p>
<p>for everybody to do,</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not</p>
<p>you suffer from depression or not.</p>
<p>And today we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>exactly how depression comes about</p>
<p>through the inflammation pathway.</p>
<p>Okay, so first of all,</p>
<p>who are the major players in creating chronic inflammation</p>
<p>in the brain and body?</p>
<p>They are the inflammatory cytokines,</p>
<p>things like IL-6, interleukin-6,</p>
<p>things like tumor necrosis alpha, TNF-alpha,</p>
<p>things like C-reactive protein, all right?</p>
<p>Not all of these are cytokines,</p>
<p>you have interferons and your prostaglandins</p>
<p>and a lot of these things.</p>
<p>But when we are stressed, chronically stressed,</p>
<p>we get inflamed,</p>
<p>our brain and various locations in the brain</p>
<p>become inflamed because certain classes of cells,</p>
<p>in particular those glial cells,</p>
<p>the cells that are typically thought</p>
<p>to just be support cells,</p>
<p>those cells and their biochemistry</p>
<p>and their dialogue with the neurons of the brain and body</p>
<p>starts to become disrupted.</p>
<p>I may have mentioned it earlier, I don&rsquo;t recall,</p>
<p>but I certainly mentioned it in an earlier podcast</p>
<p>that adrenaline, epinephrine,</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s released in the body,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t cross the blood-brain barrier,</p>
<p>but there are certain things that are able</p>
<p>to cross the blood-brain barrier when we are stressed.</p>
<p>Things like the E2 prostaglandins,</p>
<p>those cross the blood-brain barrier</p>
<p>and our blood and our brain,</p>
<p>therefore our brain and our body can communicate</p>
<p>because certain things can pass through this barrier</p>
<p>we call the BBB or the blood-brain barrier.</p>
<p>And also we have something called the glymphatic system,</p>
<p>which is really a plumbing system</p>
<p>that links the brain and body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the link between the immune system and the brain.</p>
<p>Well, there is a set of actions that we can take</p>
<p>in order to limit inflammation.</p>
<p>And this has been shown in several quality</p>
<p>peer-reviewed studies now to reduce inflammation</p>
<p>and to relieve some, and in some cases,</p>
<p>all of the symptoms of major depression.</p>
<p>One of those approaches is to increase our intake</p>
<p>of so-called EPAs or essential fatty acids.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s now a very long list of papers</p>
<p>in quality peer-reviewed journals showing</p>
<p>that when people ingest a certain level</p>
<p>of EPA omega-3 fatty acids,</p>
<p>the relief from depressive symptoms matches the SSRIs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible, right?</p>
<p>That essential fatty acids could relieve symptoms</p>
<p>of depression as well as some</p>
<p>of the prescription antidepressants.</p>
<p>Now this doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you run off</p>
<p>and stop taking your antidepressants</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve been prescribed them.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Please talk to your physician.</p>
<p>And I should mention that some of the same studies</p>
<p>have shown that increasing our intake</p>
<p>of these essential fatty acids,</p>
<p>in particular, the EPA variety of omega-3s,</p>
<p>can lower the effective dose of things like SSRIs,</p>
<p>meaning if we required a 50 milligram</p>
<p>or 40 milligram dose of fluoxetine,</p>
<p>that one can get by on a lower dose</p>
<p>and thereby perhaps not experience as many</p>
<p>or as severe side effects by taking</p>
<p>or supplementing with EPAs.</p>
<p>Now, the threshold level seems to be about one gram,</p>
<p>1,000 milligrams of EPA.</p>
<p>So you will sometimes see on a bottle of krill oil</p>
<p>or fish oil or any other source,</p>
<p>even plant source or other source of EPA,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s 1,000 milligrams or 1,200 milligrams.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s really important to look at is</p>
<p>whether or not there&rsquo;s more than 1,000 milligrams of EPA,</p>
<p>because the EPA in particular is what&rsquo;s important here.</p>
<p>And actually, in exploring some of the literature</p>
<p>on the effects of EPAs on cardiovascular health, excuse me,</p>
<p>as well as their effects on depression,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some interesting dose-dependent responses,</p>
<p>such that people who took anywhere from 400 milligrams</p>
<p>to 5,000 milligrams of EPAs,</p>
<p>achieved a variety of different benefits.</p>
<p>And in some cases, some side effects,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk about those.</p>
<p>And it does seem that this 1,000 milligrams</p>
<p>is the critical threshold for benefiting</p>
<p>or getting some relief from depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>But people who took two grams seem to do better.</p>
<p>And in the cardiovascular health realm,</p>
<p>there it&rsquo;s a little more complicated.</p>
<p>Some studies point to a very positive effect</p>
<p>on cardiovascular health by taking increasing amounts</p>
<p>of EPA, others, not so much.</p>
<p>The current data point to the fact</p>
<p>that for every gram of EPA that one ingests,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s about a 9% improvement in cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>The same dose-dependent improvement on psychological health</p>
<p>in combating depression can&rsquo;t really be stated.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say that the more EPA you take,</p>
<p>the better you&rsquo;re going to feel, so to speak.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the data point to that.</p>
<p>However, it does seem that if you take a gram,</p>
<p>1,000 milligrams or 2,000 milligrams of EPA,</p>
<p>there does seem to be some substantial relief</p>
<p>for many people, I should emphasize many, not all,</p>
<p>for many people in major depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>So how would this work?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that these inflammatory cytokines,</p>
<p>they impact neurons and the circuits of the brain</p>
<p>that relate to things like serotonin,</p>
<p>dopamine, and norepinephrine.</p>
<p>These inflammatory cytokines act</p>
<p>in a variety of different ways,</p>
<p>but they mainly act to inhibit the release</p>
<p>of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine,</p>
<p>or the synthesis of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll give you one example</p>
<p>of how EPAs can positively impact this process,</p>
<p>and then it points to a second tool,</p>
<p>which is the proper utilization of exercise</p>
<p>to offset the effects of depression.</p>
<p>So now you should understand why having healthy levels</p>
<p>of serotonin is important for maintaining healthy mood.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not responsible for all the aspects</p>
<p>of having a healthy mood.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also dopamine and norepinephrine,</p>
<p>but it is a very important one.</p>
<p>Dopamine, also called 5-HT,</p>
<p>essentially derives from a precursor called tryptophan.</p>
<p>Tryptophan arrives into our system through our diet, okay?</p>
<p>Tryptophan is an amino acid.</p>
<p>Tryptophan is found in turkey, it&rsquo;s found in carbohydrates,</p>
<p>and that should therefore raise the idea,</p>
<p>hmm, I wonder if one of the reasons</p>
<p>why people who are depressed have such an appetite</p>
<p>for carbohydrate-laden foods</p>
<p>is because they&rsquo;re trying to get more tryptophan,</p>
<p>and therefore more serotonin.</p>
<p>And indeed, that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>Tryptophan is eventually converted into serotonin.</p>
<p>However, if there&rsquo;s excessive amounts of inflammation,</p>
<p>these inflammatory cytokines cause tryptophan</p>
<p>to not be converted so much into serotonin,</p>
<p>but to be diverted down a different pathway.</p>
<p>The pathway involves something called IDO.</p>
<p>IDO-lamine, which converts tryptophan into kynurine, okay?</p>
<p>Kynurine actually acts as a neurotoxin</p>
<p>by way of converting into something</p>
<p>called quinolinic acid, okay?</p>
<p>And quinolinic acid is pro-depressive.</p>
<p>So if that seems like a complicated biochemical pathway,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s basically happening here is that the tryptophan</p>
<p>that normally would be made into serotonin</p>
<p>under conditions of inflammation</p>
<p>is being diverted into a neurotoxic pathway.</p>
<p>And ingestion of EPAs,</p>
<p>because it limits these inflammatory cytokines,</p>
<p>things like IL-6, C-reactive protein, et cetera,</p>
<p>can cause more of the tryptophan that one ingests</p>
<p>or has in their body to be diverted</p>
<p>towards the serotonergic pathway.</p>
<p>Exercise, it turns out, also has a positive effect</p>
<p>on the tryptophan to serotonin conversion pathway.</p>
<p>And the way it does it is really interesting.</p>
<p>You now know that tryptophan</p>
<p>can either be converted into serotonin</p>
<p>or it can be converted into this neurotoxin,</p>
<p>which is a bad thing.</p>
<p>Exercise, the activation of the muscles</p>
<p>through rhythmic repeated use,</p>
<p>in particular aerobic exercise,</p>
<p>but also resistance training has been shown</p>
<p>to do this to some extent,</p>
<p>tends to sequester or shuttle the kynurine into the muscle</p>
<p>so that it isn&rsquo;t converted into this neurotoxin</p>
<p>that is pro-depression, okay?</p>
<p>There are a lot of steps in the pathway</p>
<p>leading to depression,</p>
<p>but what this essentially means</p>
<p>is that hitting a certain threshold level of EPA intake,</p>
<p>whether by supplementation with fish oil or krill oil</p>
<p>or through some plant source,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not into ingesting fish or krill,</p>
<p>or trying to get up above that 1,000 milligram threshold</p>
<p>for EPA by ingesting particular food sources,</p>
<p>you certainly can do it through food,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to supplement,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s easier to do with supplements,</p>
<p>that doing that will limit the inflammation</p>
<p>that diverts tryptophan into this neurotoxic pathway.</p>
<p>And exercise as well augments this conversion</p>
<p>of tryptophan into serotonin</p>
<p>because it takes this thing</p>
<p>that would potentially be a neurotoxin</p>
<p>and it sequesters it, it pulls it away</p>
<p>so that it can&rsquo;t actually go have its pro-depressive effects.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got multiple steps here,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re describing two tools,</p>
<p>increasing EPA and regular exercise</p>
<p>as a way of increasing serotonin somewhat indirectly,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s by limiting this bad pathway</p>
<p>to promote the activity of a good pathway.</p>
<p>But from the data that are published</p>
<p>in quality peer-reviewed journals,</p>
<p>it really appears that this inflammation pathway</p>
<p>does function to increase depression</p>
<p>through these pathways.</p>
<p>And so knowing that there are behavioral steps</p>
<p>and supplementation-based steps,</p>
<p>or if you prefer getting your EPAs from typical food,</p>
<p>from nutritional approaches,</p>
<p>I find that very reassuring</p>
<p>that the mechanisms all converge on a common pathway,</p>
<p>serotonin, that gives me great peace of mind</p>
<p>that when people say, hey, go out for a run</p>
<p>or you should get outdoors, exercise,</p>
<p>or you should take fish oil or like the Scandinavians do,</p>
<p>I have Scandinavian family members</p>
<p>and they are known to,</p>
<p>or I should say they are quite open about the fact</p>
<p>that during the winter months in particular</p>
<p>when depression is more likely,</p>
<p>but throughout the year really,</p>
<p>they make an effort to regularly ingest high levels of EPA,</p>
<p>either through ingesting fatty fish and its skin,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a particular fan of ingesting</p>
<p>the skin of fatty fish,</p>
<p>or by supplementing with cod liver oil</p>
<p>or other types of fish oil,</p>
<p>sardines and things of that sort, sardine oils.</p>
<p>There are a number of different things out there</p>
<p>that one could use.</p>
<p>So I find it very reassuring</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a common biochemical pathway</p>
<p>that can explain why these things not just work,</p>
<p>but why they should work.</p>
<p>They should work because they operate</p>
<p>in the very same biochemical pathways</p>
<p>that antidepressants that are prescribed to people do.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for you?</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;re somebody who suffers from major depression,</p>
<p>again, don&rsquo;t stop taking your prescribed medication,</p>
<p>talk to your doctor,</p>
<p>but talk to them perhaps about the EPAs and exercise</p>
<p>and how these things can impinge</p>
<p>on the same biochemical pathways.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s not suffering from major depression,</p>
<p>I still think these pathways</p>
<p>are really important to understand.</p>
<p>And actually knowing these pathways</p>
<p>is additional motivation to get regular exercise.</p>
<p>I think we all know that we should be getting</p>
<p>anywhere from 150 minutes to 180 minutes per week</p>
<p>of so-called zone two cardio for cardiovascular effects.</p>
<p>Zone two is the kind of mellowish cardio</p>
<p>where you can sort of hold a conversation if you needed to,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a little bit tough.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re kind of sucking for air a little bit.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to limit these depressive like symptoms.</p>
<p>I think in all of us,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that we should think of depression</p>
<p>as a strict threshold.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m somebody who personally has made the choice</p>
<p>to take a thousand milligrams of EPA per day.</p>
<p>I do that by supplementing fish oil.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s debate out there as to whether or not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s better to take EPA and DHA in particular ratios</p>
<p>and whether or not DHA can impact the LDL,</p>
<p>which is the so-called bad cholesterol.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s getting really down into the weeds.</p>
<p>And we can talk about that in a future episode.</p>
<p>But for myself,</p>
<p>I notice a pretty substantial positive effect</p>
<p>of taking anywhere from a thousand milligrams</p>
<p>to 2000 milligrams of EPA per day.</p>
<p>I do that through supplementation</p>
<p>and I do strive to try and eat some fish,</p>
<p>even though frankly I&rsquo;ve never liked the taste of fish.</p>
<p>For those of you that would like a little more detail</p>
<p>or perhaps a lot more detail into the effects of EPA</p>
<p>on depression and in relieving depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>And if you want to get into the nitty gritty of it,</p>
<p>I invite you to go to examine.com,</p>
<p>put in depression, EPA.</p>
<p>They list off and have links to 28 studies</p>
<p>on the effects of EPA on major depression.</p>
<p>If you go to PubMed,</p>
<p>there are many, many studies on this now</p>
<p>that date back several decades, really.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in the specific effects of EPA</p>
<p>as opposed to DHA,</p>
<p>I want to point you towards a particular study entitled,</p>
<p>not surprisingly, EPA but not DHA,</p>
<p>appears to be responsible for the efficacy</p>
<p>of omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid</p>
<p>supplementation in depression,</p>
<p>evidence from a meta-analysis of randomized control trials.</p>
<p>This is a really wonderful paper.</p>
<p>The author is Julian Martins, M-A-R-T-I-N-S.</p>
<p>It was published in 2009.</p>
<p>We will provide a link to this study in the caption.</p>
<p>That study is really the one that at least to me</p>
<p>points to why EPA in particular is what&rsquo;s effective</p>
<p>and that whether or not DHA is problematic or not</p>
<p>is a separate issue,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really the EPA that one wants</p>
<p>to hit a certain threshold level of</p>
<p>if one&rsquo;s goal is to get relief from depression</p>
<p>or to keep depression at bay by keeping mood elevated,</p>
<p>which is why I take high dose EPA.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got EPA, we&rsquo;ve got exercise.</p>
<p>Now you understand how they work to adjust mood.</p>
<p>Now I want to talk about something that at least for me</p>
<p>was quite surprising when I first learned about it</p>
<p>for sake of treatment of mood disorders,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s creatine.</p>
<p>Creatine has a number of very important functions</p>
<p>throughout the body.</p>
<p>For those of you that are into resistance training,</p>
<p>and actually for those of you that are</p>
<p>into endurance training as well,</p>
<p>creatine has achieved a lot of popularity in recent years</p>
<p>because supplementation with creatine</p>
<p>can draw more water into muscles</p>
<p>and can increase power output from muscles.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s something that does indeed work.</p>
<p>There have been debates about whether or not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unhealthy for the kidneys</p>
<p>to take long-term creatine supplementation at high doses.</p>
<p>And I invite you to go down that rabbit hole.</p>
<p>I think most people now accept the idea</p>
<p>that for most people, not all, but for most people,</p>
<p>low dose creatine supplementation of anywhere</p>
<p>from one gram to five grams per day</p>
<p>can have a number of positive effects</p>
<p>on physical performance.</p>
<p>People with kidney issues, et cetera,</p>
<p>need to be especially cautious,</p>
<p>but creatine is interesting for that purpose.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s also a so-called phosphocreatine system</p>
<p>in the brain, and that phosphocreatine system</p>
<p>has everything to do with the dialogue between neurons</p>
<p>and these other cell types called glia,</p>
<p>and glia comprise several cell types,</p>
<p>microglia, astrocytes, et cetera.</p>
<p>But the phosphocreatine system in the forebrain</p>
<p>in particular, in the front of our brain,</p>
<p>has been shown to be involved in regulation of mood</p>
<p>and some of the reward pathways, as well as in depression.</p>
<p>And there are now several studies, at least three,</p>
<p>although there are probably more by time this comes out</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re coming out very quickly now,</p>
<p>at least three quality studies pointing to the fact</p>
<p>that creatine supplementation doesn&rsquo;t just have</p>
<p>these positive effects on physical performance,</p>
<p>but can also be used as a way to increase mood</p>
<p>and to improve the symptoms of major depression.</p>
<p>This has been now done</p>
<p>in several double-blind placebo-controlled studies.</p>
<p>These studies have looked at women, have looked at men,</p>
<p>have looked at adolescents, some of whom were taking SSRIs,</p>
<p>some of whom were not.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve done magnetic resonance spectroscopy.</p>
<p>So spectroscopy is a way that you can look at</p>
<p>the concentrations of particular compounds in the brain</p>
<p>in real time in humans.</p>
<p>It can be used for other things as well, of course.</p>
<p>And basically what&rsquo;s been observed is that</p>
<p>increasing the activity of the phosphocreatine system</p>
<p>in the forebrain can be beneficial,</p>
<p>or at least as correlated with improvements in mood.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just talk for a moment about what&rsquo;s involved</p>
<p>with using or supplementing creatine</p>
<p>in order to improve mood and perhaps even treat depression.</p>
<p>First of all, when I talk about creatine,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about creatine monohydrate.</p>
<p>There are a number of different forms of creatine.</p>
<p>Here I&rsquo;m talking about creatine monohydrate.</p>
<p>The American Journal of Psychiatry in 2012</p>
<p>published a study which was a randomized</p>
<p>double-blind placebo-controlled trial</p>
<p>of oral creatine monohydrate.</p>
<p>And what it found is that it could augment</p>
<p>or enhance the response to a selective serotonin</p>
<p>reuptake inhibitor, in particular in women</p>
<p>with major depressive disorder.</p>
<p>So like EPA, creatine supplementation seems to either</p>
<p>lower the required dose of SSRI</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s required to treat depression,</p>
<p>or can improve the effectiveness of a given dose of SSRI.</p>
<p>However, there are other studies that have looked directly</p>
<p>at creatine supplementation in the absence of SSRIs,</p>
<p>and those are interesting as well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a wonderful and very comprehensive review</p>
<p>on creatine for the treatment of major depression</p>
<p>that includes beautiful tables of all the subjects</p>
<p>and the dosages, et cetera.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to read off every line</p>
<p>and every column in that review,</p>
<p>but we will provide a link to that review as well.</p>
<p>One of the things that&rsquo;s really striking</p>
<p>about the lists of studies that they include</p>
<p>is that most of them used dosages</p>
<p>that are pretty reasonable for most people,</p>
<p>anywhere from three grams to five grams,</p>
<p>sometimes up to as many 10 grams per day of creatine.</p>
<p>Many of these also were shown to increase activity</p>
<p>of this phosphocreatine system in the forebrain.</p>
<p>And some show a relationship</p>
<p>between that phosphocreatine system</p>
<p>and a particular category of receptors in the brain</p>
<p>called the NMDA receptor, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.</p>
<p>The NMDA receptor is one of the first things</p>
<p>that every budding neuroscientist learns about</p>
<p>because it is the receptor</p>
<p>that has particular electrical and chemical properties</p>
<p>that make it a critical gate for so-called neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a receptor that&rsquo;s activated in the brain</p>
<p>typically for just the functioning of the brain</p>
<p>on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a receptor that&rsquo;s activated</p>
<p>when circuits are going to change,</p>
<p>when they are inspired to change</p>
<p>by some very strong stimulus, meaning some experience,</p>
<p>or in some cases a drug, or in some cases something else.</p>
<p>But the NMDA receptor is a kind of a key node</p>
<p>for shifting brain circuitry.</p>
<p>And so while the details aren&rsquo;t entirely clear,</p>
<p>it seems that creatine supplementation</p>
<p>leads to increases in the phosphocreatine system</p>
<p>in the forebrain,</p>
<p>and that increases in the activity of the forebrain</p>
<p>phosphocreatine system relate to changes</p>
<p>in the way the NMDA receptors function</p>
<p>and may lead to some of the plasticity,</p>
<p>the changes in neural circuits that underlie the shift</p>
<p>from negative mood and affect to positive mood.</p>
<p>Now, there are a lot of gaps.</p>
<p>Those are, you know, there are a lot of little boxes</p>
<p>or bins in the diagram I just laid out for you.</p>
<p>And some of them are still truly black boxes, as we say,</p>
<p>meaning we don&rsquo;t really know what&rsquo;s in them yet</p>
<p>and more mechanistic data are coming.</p>
<p>However, when you look over the data in this review,</p>
<p>or when I look over the data in this review,</p>
<p>what you find is that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re pretty striking positive effects of creatine.</p>
<p>And one of the more interesting effects</p>
<p>is that creatine has actually been shown to increase mania</p>
<p>in people that are already manic.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not talking about bipolar depression today,</p>
<p>but it seems that creatine elevates levels of activation</p>
<p>and kind of mood overall.</p>
<p>And you could see why that would be a problem</p>
<p>for somebody that&rsquo;s already in a manic phase,</p>
<p>but it actually might be beneficial</p>
<p>for somebody who is very low affect</p>
<p>and has a major depression.</p>
<p>So should you supplement with creatine?</p>
<p>Well, as always talk to your healthcare provider,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re somebody who is thinking about things</p>
<p>that you can do and things that you can take</p>
<p>in order to improve your mood, keep depression at bay,</p>
<p>maybe even support other treatments for major depression,</p>
<p>the creatine system seems like a logical one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s at least strong studies</p>
<p>and a good number of them to look to,</p>
<p>to determine whether or not that&rsquo;s right for you.</p>
<p>I personally take five grams of creatine for other reasons.</p>
<p>I take it for the physical performance enhancing effects,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of nice to think that perhaps</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also helping me improve my mood.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a choice that I&rsquo;ve made for me</p>
<p>as in within the margins of safety for me in my life.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s right for everybody,</p>
<p>but I find it very interesting.</p>
<p>And again, I find it particularly interesting</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a logical biochemical pathway</p>
<p>to support the finding that it improves mood</p>
<p>and can offset the effects of major depression</p>
<p>in some cases,</p>
<p>or can improve the effects of antidepressant medication</p>
<p>in many cases.</p>
<p>When I see mechanism and I see effectiveness</p>
<p>and the mechanism and the effectiveness map</p>
<p>to a lot of the same mechanisms</p>
<p>that are involved in prescription drugs,</p>
<p>that gives me great reassurance</p>
<p>that this isn&rsquo;t just some sort of mysterious pathway</p>
<p>or mysterious compound by which creatine might be working.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;ve kind of clustered together EPA&rsquo;s exercise</p>
<p>and their relationship to inflammation,</p>
<p>creatine and its relationship to forebrain function</p>
<p>and the phosphocreatine system and this NMDA receptor.</p>
<p>And as you&rsquo;ll see in a few minutes,</p>
<p>that NMDA receptor turns out to be vitally important</p>
<p>and is actually one of the main nodes of action</p>
<p>for some of the more novel and exciting therapeutics</p>
<p>that are being explored now in psychiatric clinics.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk a little bit more about this NMDA receptor</p>
<p>and how it relates to some of the more experimental</p>
<p>or novel therapeutic compounds</p>
<p>for the treatment of major depression.</p>
<p>And the compounds that we&rsquo;re going to be talking about,</p>
<p>you may have heard of before,</p>
<p>one is ketamine, which is getting increasing interest</p>
<p>in psychiatric clinics</p>
<p>and in various experimental and clinical studies.</p>
<p>And the other is PCP.</p>
<p>Both ketamine and PCP are known drugs of abuse.</p>
<p>For many years, people have abused these drugs,</p>
<p>go by the street name Special K, et cetera.</p>
<p>And they create dissociative anesthetic states.</p>
<p>So dissociative states where people don&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>as closely meshed with their emotions and their perceptions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an odd state, I hear.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an odd state that clinicians are now leveraging</p>
<p>for the treatment of depression.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about why that is.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s talk a little bit about this NMDA receptor</p>
<p>and why ketamine and PCP might work</p>
<p>for the treatment of depression</p>
<p>or how they even could work.</p>
<p>I want to be very direct that this is an area</p>
<p>that still needs a lot of data.</p>
<p>There are, however, some excellent papers</p>
<p>from really terrific groups.</p>
<p>One of them is a paper that was published</p>
<p>in Nature last year, 2020.</p>
<p>First author is Vesuna, Sam Vesuna, V-E-S-U-N-A.</p>
<p>And the last author and the lead on the study</p>
<p>was Dr. Karl Deisseroth,</p>
<p>who was a guest on the Huberman Lab podcast</p>
<p>a few months ago.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a world expert in neuroscience.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a psychiatrist.</p>
<p>And this paper from Sam Vesuna and Karl and colleagues</p>
<p>explored how these dissociative states come about.</p>
<p>And they looked at this both in animals and in humans</p>
<p>and found that there was essentially a common mechanism</p>
<p>whereby a particular layer of cortex,</p>
<p>so your brain has this outer shell of tissue</p>
<p>that is called the neocortex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s where our perceptions lie.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s where our associations lie.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very important area for processing,</p>
<p>decision-making and planning, et cetera.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally stacks of cells.</p>
<p>And one of those layers in the stack of cells is layer five.</p>
<p>And the layer five neurons in particular</p>
<p>went into a particular rhythm of electrical activity,</p>
<p>this one to three Hertz rhythm</p>
<p>after mice or humans were administered ketamine or PCP.</p>
<p>There was activation of a particular area of the brain,</p>
<p>this retrosplenial cortex as it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>And the dissociative state that emerged</p>
<p>was an interesting one.</p>
<p>And clinically what&rsquo;s described in the trials for ketamine</p>
<p>and things like it,</p>
<p>that people who are depressed will take ketamine,</p>
<p>will experience a kind of separateness from their grief</p>
<p>and from their emotions.</p>
<p>And that possibly there&rsquo;s plasticity,</p>
<p>there actually shifts in the neural circuitry</p>
<p>such that their emotions don&rsquo;t weigh on them so heavily.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using very loose language here,</p>
<p>but that they don&rsquo;t feel as overridden</p>
<p>or as burdened by their own emotions</p>
<p>as they did previously to the ketamine therapy.</p>
<p>Now, absolutely in no way, shape or form,</p>
<p>in my suggestion that people run out</p>
<p>and take ketamine in order to treat their own depression.</p>
<p>These drugs are still very much experimental,</p>
<p>although they are approved in certain contexts,</p>
<p>at least in the US by prescription</p>
<p>for the treatment of depression.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting to me is that these dissociative states</p>
<p>sound at least at the outset to be more of a separateness</p>
<p>from everything.</p>
<p>It sounds a little bit like depression itself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like anhedonia,</p>
<p>an inability to experience pleasure.</p>
<p>And then one takes a dissociative anesthetic</p>
<p>and somehow is able to get relief</p>
<p>by getting even further away from an experience.</p>
<p>To me, that doesn&rsquo;t make sense,</p>
<p>but that just speaks to the fact that these drugs</p>
<p>and these receptors and these pathways</p>
<p>operate through very cryptic means.</p>
<p>And we really don&rsquo;t understand all the pathways</p>
<p>in the brain that relate to motivation and mood</p>
<p>and so forth.</p>
<p>And the results with these ketamine trials</p>
<p>are looking very promising.</p>
<p>In fact, there are a number of trials that show</p>
<p>that a fair number of people that take ketamine</p>
<p>in a therapeutic setting legally</p>
<p>with a psychiatrist guiding the experience</p>
<p>are able to get relief from their symptoms</p>
<p>without the need for many, many treatments with the drug.</p>
<p>Just how many treatments varies</p>
<p>from individual to individual,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not like people have to take this stuff on going.</p>
<p>This is really an attempt to tap into this NMDA receptor</p>
<p>that is related to neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Both ketamine and PCP essentially act as antagonists,</p>
<p>which means they block the NMDA receptor.</p>
<p>They do it through different methods,</p>
<p>non-competitive and competitive for you,</p>
<p>chemists and pharmacologists out there.</p>
<p>You can look it up if you like.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s therefore even more surprising</p>
<p>is that every neuroscientist learns</p>
<p>that activation of the NMDA receptor,</p>
<p>not antagonism or blocking of the NMDA receptor</p>
<p>leads to changes in neural circuitry in very profound ways.</p>
<p>In fact, experimentally,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve done these experiments myself,</p>
<p>if you want to prevent plasticity,</p>
<p>you want to prevent an experience</p>
<p>from reshaping neural circuitry,</p>
<p>you give an NMDA receptor blocker.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done that many times</p>
<p>in the course of my experimental neuroscience career,</p>
<p>not to myself, obviously,</p>
<p>but in the course of doing experiments.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s still a bit mysterious to me</p>
<p>how this could work.</p>
<p>A couple of things.</p>
<p>One is this layer five activation is pretty interesting.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to come back to layer five</p>
<p>when we talk about yet another emerging treatment</p>
<p>for depression, which is psilocybin,</p>
<p>so-called magic mushrooms,</p>
<p>and the effects of psilocybin on layer five neurons</p>
<p>in the cortex.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a common theme emerging here,</p>
<p>which is that layer five activity in the cortex</p>
<p>may be important for rewiring the brain in certain ways</p>
<p>that can lead to recovery</p>
<p>or to an alleviation of some of the symptoms</p>
<p>of major depression.</p>
<p>So if this is sounding a little bit vague to you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because this is still truly experimental</p>
<p>and new and still very much on the cutting edge</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s happening now.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have all the answers.</p>
<p>So if it sounds like I&rsquo;m moving slowly through this</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m being extra careful about what I say,</p>
<p>you are correct.</p>
<p>Your antennae are correct in this case.</p>
<p>I never want to misstep and say something that&rsquo;s not true,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s especially the case</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re talking about experimental therapies and drugs,</p>
<p>which formerly were taken as drugs of abuse,</p>
<p>which are now being used as drugs</p>
<p>for therapeutic treatment in the clinic.</p>
<p>There is a very interesting study.</p>
<p>This was published in Science in 2019.</p>
<p>So these are very recent studies.</p>
<p>The last author on this is Liston, L-I-S-T-O-N.</p>
<p>The title of the paper is</p>
<p>Sustained Rescue of Prefrontal Circuit Dysfunction</p>
<p>by Antidepressant Induced Spine Formation.</p>
<p>And here, when we hear spine,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not referring to spine as in your vertebrae</p>
<p>running down your spinal column.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about the spines,</p>
<p>which are these little protrusions on neurons.</p>
<p>Neurons are not smooth by any stretch.</p>
<p>If you zoom in on a neuron,</p>
<p>if you were to come to my lab</p>
<p>and look down the microscope at a neuron</p>
<p>and zoom in on it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d find that some neurons are smooth,</p>
<p>but most neurons have these little protrusions.</p>
<p>And those little protrusions are called spines.</p>
<p>And those little spiny protrusions</p>
<p>are little sites where neurons can reach out</p>
<p>and form and receive new synapses from neighboring neurons.</p>
<p>So they increase the surface area of a neuron</p>
<p>and allow new connections to be formed.</p>
<p>And so spine formation is synonymous with neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>which is synonymous with changes in circuit function,</p>
<p>which is synonymous with changes in the ways that we think,</p>
<p>we feel, and we behave.</p>
<p>And what was shown in this study is really interesting.</p>
<p>What they showed is that ketamine</p>
<p>can relieve depressive symptoms rapidly</p>
<p>by changing or increasing, in this case,</p>
<p>the spines on these neurons in the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>And if that word prefrontal rings a bell,</p>
<p>well, now you remember.</p>
<p>The phosphocreatine system,</p>
<p>the ingestion of creatine monohydrate,</p>
<p>and the forebrain, activation of the forebrain,</p>
<p>were related to, in some way or another,</p>
<p>to relief or improvement of major depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re starting to converge on a picture here</p>
<p>whereby these drugs, ketamine, PCP,</p>
<p>used in a therapeutic context,</p>
<p>may be increasing neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>literally the changing of neural circuits in the forebrain,</p>
<p>somehow through dissociative states.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to speculate too much</p>
<p>about how that might come about,</p>
<p>but one of the things that&rsquo;s such a resounding</p>
<p>or repeating theme of major depression</p>
<p>is that when you talk to somebody who has major depression,</p>
<p>it is a real downer.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not being disparaging of those people,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;ve ever had a conversation</p>
<p>with someone who&rsquo;s depressed,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re always talking about how exhausted they are,</p>
<p>or in really severe cases,</p>
<p>they are not even responsive at all.</p>
<p>They just kind of stare at you blankly,</p>
<p>or they fall asleep.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re truly depressed.</p>
<p>Their system is lowered in terms of its activation state.</p>
<p>So I think that it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>that the application of drugs</p>
<p>that allow people to separate from that state</p>
<p>of not caring or being uninterested</p>
<p>or unwilling to do anything</p>
<p>is actually one of the paths to treatment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always about just getting people peppy</p>
<p>and excited and happy.</p>
<p>There also seems to be a requirement</p>
<p>for getting them distanced from their own grief.</p>
<p>And this brings us back to something that we talked about</p>
<p>way back at the beginning of this episode,</p>
<p>which was this particular feature</p>
<p>of the anti-self confabulation,</p>
<p>that everything that happens is a reflection</p>
<p>that I should say for the depressed person,</p>
<p>that everything that happens is a reflection</p>
<p>of how life is bad and their experiences</p>
<p>just point to the fact that nothing is going to get better.</p>
<p>This is the common language of depression.</p>
<p>If this is very depressing to hear me talk about,</p>
<p>it is heavy and that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s like to hear these things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even heavier, of course,</p>
<p>for somebody to experience them.</p>
<p>And those beliefs, those patterns of guilt and grief</p>
<p>and anhedonia and delusional anti-self confabulations,</p>
<p>those are the things that eventually,</p>
<p>if they get severe enough,</p>
<p>start to convert into things like self-harm, mutilation,</p>
<p>and in the most tragic of cases, of course, suicide.</p>
<p>And so I think we can look to these treatments</p>
<p>such as ketamine and PCP,</p>
<p>but in particular ketamine and its use in the clinic</p>
<p>as ways for people to get distanced</p>
<p>from the negative affect that they feel</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t just inside them or overwhelms them,</p>
<p>but that for the very severely depressed person,</p>
<p>they feel is them.</p>
<p>And we hear this sometimes, you are not your emotions.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s a statement</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve always been a little bit challenged by.</p>
<p>I mean, yes, indeed,</p>
<p>emotions are not who we are.</p>
<p>They are states that we go into and out of,</p>
<p>including happiness and sadness,</p>
<p>but they are very much a part of us when we experience them.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t experience them as next to us or behind us</p>
<p>or across the room from us.</p>
<p>We experience them as our emotions.</p>
<p>They are so much part and parcel</p>
<p>with our experience of ourself</p>
<p>that a statement like we aren&rsquo;t our emotions</p>
<p>is a very hard statement to digest,</p>
<p>especially for the depressed person.</p>
<p>And so I think that the NMDA receptor</p>
<p>and its capacity to induce neuroplasticity circuit changes,</p>
<p>the fact that PCP and ketamine</p>
<p>are both showing activation of neural circuits</p>
<p>by way of suppressing activity of the NMDA receptor</p>
<p>and some of the positive or exciting therapeutic outcomes</p>
<p>that are coming from this really point to the fact</p>
<p>that ketamine and PCP and removal of negative experiences</p>
<p>or the experience of a negative experience,</p>
<p>sort of getting meta there,</p>
<p>but the experience of a negative experience</p>
<p>may be an important path by which people</p>
<p>treat their depression,</p>
<p>especially in its most severe forms</p>
<p>where people are veering towards</p>
<p>self-harm mutilation and suicide.</p>
<p>So you may have noticed a theme,</p>
<p>which is that certain categories of approaches</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been discussing for offsetting</p>
<p>the symptoms of depression, such as exercise,</p>
<p>ingesting EPAs, reducing inflammation,</p>
<p>or even the SSRIs for increasing serotonin,</p>
<p>focus on changing some core biological function,</p>
<p>like raising the amount of a chemical, serotonin,</p>
<p>or reducing the amount of inflammatory cytokines</p>
<p>in the brain and body.</p>
<p>And yet things like ketamine</p>
<p>focus more on rewiring circuitry,</p>
<p>changing neural circuitry so that it functions better</p>
<p>in the immediate and hopefully in the long-term as well</p>
<p>and keep people with major depression</p>
<p>in what they call remission, away from major depression.</p>
<p>Another category of treatments</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being actively explored now in laboratories</p>
<p>and in the psychiatry realm are the psychedelics.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a huge category of compounds.</p>
<p>However, one in particular, psilocybin is one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being most intensely and actively pursued</p>
<p>for its capacity to treat major depressive disorder.</p>
<p>I want to be very clear that the work</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m going to describe is work</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being done in university settings,</p>
<p>university hospitals by scientists and psychiatrists.</p>
<p>And these are clinical studies,</p>
<p>clinical trials leading to peer-reviewed data.</p>
<p>And those are the data that we&rsquo;ll be discussing.</p>
<p>Some of the major luminaries in this area include,</p>
<p>of course, aren&rsquo;t limited to,</p>
<p>but include people like Matthew Johnson,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s at Johns Hopkins.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll discuss some of his work now.</p>
<p>And fortunate to say that he will be coming on the podcast</p>
<p>as a guest to describe the studies</p>
<p>in a variety of laboratories,</p>
<p>working on a variety of different psychedelic compounds.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s focus on psilocybin for its capacity</p>
<p>to rewire neural circuits and alleviate depression.</p>
<p>There have been anecdotal data or evidence over the years</p>
<p>that psilocybin has this capacity.</p>
<p>How does psilocybin work?</p>
<p>Well, psilocybin magic mushrooms, as it&rsquo;s sometimes called,</p>
<p>mainly works on what&rsquo;s called the serotonin 5H2A receptor</p>
<p>with some affinity for the 5HT1 receptor.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>Well, basically you&rsquo;ve got a lot of different kinds</p>
<p>of serotonin receptors,</p>
<p>just as you have a lot of different kinds</p>
<p>of dopamine receptors or other types of receptors.</p>
<p>The advantage of having different receptors</p>
<p>expressed in different parts of the brain and body,</p>
<p>even on different parts of individual cells</p>
<p>in the brain and body,</p>
<p>is that the same compound serotonin</p>
<p>can have a diverse set of effects</p>
<p>on different cells and tissues.</p>
<p>This is also the basis of some of the side effect profiles</p>
<p>of SSRIs, because maybe, for instance,</p>
<p>we know that taking Prozac fluoxetine</p>
<p>will increase serotonin in one area,</p>
<p>but also in another area,</p>
<p>and then they will go have diverse effects</p>
<p>on different brain circuits</p>
<p>because of the variety of receptors.</p>
<p>Receptors are just like parking slots</p>
<p>where the molecule serotonin parks and has different effects.</p>
<p>Well, psilocybin engages or increases</p>
<p>serotonin transmission,</p>
<p>meaning it increases the amount of serotonin,</p>
<p>mainly by acting at these 5H2A receptors.</p>
<p>But where in the brain does it happen</p>
<p>and what are the major effects?</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s talk about the major effects,</p>
<p>because I think that&rsquo;s what people are interested in.</p>
<p>The study that I&rsquo;d like to highlight</p>
<p>is a fairly recent one.</p>
<p>It was published in May of 2021 in Journal,</p>
<p>Journal, excuse me,</p>
<p>of the American Medical Association Psychiatry,</p>
<p>so JAMA Psychiatry,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s entitled</p>
<p>Effects of Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy</p>
<p>on Major Depressive Disorder,</p>
<p>a Randomized Clinical Trial.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an absolutely beautiful study,</p>
<p>a very important study.</p>
<p>It includes some of the luminaries in this area,</p>
<p>like Matthew Johnson,</p>
<p>Patrick Finnan,</p>
<p>Roland Griffiths,</p>
<p>and others.</p>
<p>We will provide a link to this study.</p>
<p>It is available in its full form at zero cost</p>
<p>if you want to read it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a lot of detail,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m just going to summarize a few things,</p>
<p>but basically what they did</p>
<p>was they screened for patients to come into the clinic.</p>
<p>These were people that suffered</p>
<p>from major depressive disorder.</p>
<p>And administered either one or two rounds of psilocybin.</p>
<p>They used particular dosages.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re listed in the study,</p>
<p>so you can look it up</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re really interested in that level of detail.</p>
<p>Typically it was 20 milligrams per kilogram of body weight,</p>
<p>so it depends on body weight,</p>
<p>or 30 milligrams of psilocybin</p>
<p>per 70 kilograms of body weight.</p>
<p>They were given in capsule form,</p>
<p>so people weren&rsquo;t eating the mushrooms.</p>
<p>This is obviously a very controlled study,</p>
<p>and they want to control the dosages appropriately.</p>
<p>They were randomized to begin the treatment immediately,</p>
<p>or after an eight-week delay.</p>
<p>They had all the appropriate control groups</p>
<p>that one would like to see.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s really striking about this study</p>
<p>is that there was a very significant improvement</p>
<p>in mood and affect and relief from depressive symptoms</p>
<p>in anywhere from 50 to 70% of the people</p>
<p>that were subjects in the study</p>
<p>who received the psilocybin treatment.</p>
<p>And whether or not it was 50,</p>
<p>or whether or not it was 71%,</p>
<p>varied according to how long after the study</p>
<p>they maintain these antidepressive effects,</p>
<p>or whether or not they stayed in remission</p>
<p>from the depression.</p>
<p>But these are really enormous and significant effects,</p>
<p>and very exciting,</p>
<p>and are pointing in the direction of psilocybin</p>
<p>very soon becoming a treatment</p>
<p>for various forms of depression,</p>
<p>including major depression.</p>
<p>Now, of course, this is limited to the laboratory at present.</p>
<p>There are a number of elements of these studies</p>
<p>that are important to take into consideration too,</p>
<p>which is that there are highly trained guides,</p>
<p>meaning people to direct people through the experience.</p>
<p>As Matthew Johnson has told me,</p>
<p>there is the occurrence from time to time</p>
<p>of people having so-called bad trips,</p>
<p>of having anxiety attacks</p>
<p>during the hallucinations and all that.</p>
<p>And they have ways to mitigate that and deal with that</p>
<p>because the guides are trained.</p>
<p>They have all the sorts of medical monitoring devices</p>
<p>for heart rate and temperature</p>
<p>and things that one would like to see</p>
<p>for a study like this,</p>
<p>because these are very powerful compounds.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to give away any elements of the discussion</p>
<p>with Matthew Johnson,</p>
<p>because it will be released in podcast form</p>
<p>reasonably soon here, the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>But one of the things that came up,</p>
<p>and is a fundamental question that I had,</p>
<p>that I think probably many of you are asking is,</p>
<p>does the experience that one has on these compounds</p>
<p>make a difference for whether or not</p>
<p>somebody gains relief from depression</p>
<p>from these psilocybin journeys or not?</p>
<p>In other words, does it matter what they talk about?</p>
<p>Does it matter what they think about?</p>
<p>Does it matter if they have a good trip or a bad trip?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to hold you in too much suspense.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let Matthew provide the more thorough answer.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s really interesting is</p>
<p>there are some common themes to psilocybin administration</p>
<p>and experience that lead to relief from depressive symptoms,</p>
<p>but they are subjectively, excuse me,</p>
<p>subjectively very varied.</p>
<p>Meaning that whether or not people feel</p>
<p>they had a good experience or a bad experience,</p>
<p>whether or not people thought about their parents</p>
<p>or thought about the color of the ceiling</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem to have too much of an impact</p>
<p>on whether or not they receive relief</p>
<p>during these studies, in these clinical studies.</p>
<p>It seems like different people</p>
<p>can have lots of different experiences</p>
<p>and still receive benefit.</p>
<p>And that points to something deeper.</p>
<p>It points to the fact that these drugs,</p>
<p>which is really what they are,</p>
<p>are rewiring neural circuitry in a common way</p>
<p>despite a diversity of experience while on the drug.</p>
<p>And that itself is really interesting.</p>
<p>And it takes us back to a place that we&rsquo;ve been before</p>
<p>in this discussion, which is layer five of the cortex,</p>
<p>this area that ketamine seems to impact as well</p>
<p>by generating rhythms of the,</p>
<p>I mentioned one to three Hertz activity</p>
<p>in layer five of certain areas of the cortex.</p>
<p>Well, the 5-HT1A receptor is known to be enriched</p>
<p>in layer five of the cortex.</p>
<p>And layer five of the cortex is a very interesting area</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s an area in which</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of lateral connectivity.</p>
<p>So connections between different brain areas,</p>
<p>laterally generally is what allows us</p>
<p>to merge different senses.</p>
<p>So for instance, when we hear a sound off to our right,</p>
<p>over here, we turn to our right,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a very hardwired response.</p>
<p>And typically we hear something off to our right,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t look to our left.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how hardwired some of these circuits are.</p>
<p>What appears to be happening is that the activation</p>
<p>of the serotonin system in 5-HT1A receptor in layer five</p>
<p>is offering up or providing an experience</p>
<p>whereby the lateral connections are able to engage</p>
<p>much more broadly than they would normally.</p>
<p>Now that also could be a bad thing.</p>
<p>And I asked Matt about this,</p>
<p>that sounds kind of spooky.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that when I hear something off to my right</p>
<p>that I want to look off to my left,</p>
<p>that could be highly maladaptive,</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s a car coming at me from my right.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t seem to be what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really rewiring these deeply reflexive circuits.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s somehow rewiring associations between events,</p>
<p>emotional events, past events, current events,</p>
<p>and future events in ways that allow people</p>
<p>to get some sort of relief or distance from these narratives,</p>
<p>these depressive stories about their past and present,</p>
<p>and allow them to see new opportunity</p>
<p>and optimism in the future.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really a fascinating thing</p>
<p>if you really think about it,</p>
<p>because I would have thought that simply by ramping up</p>
<p>laterality of connections,</p>
<p>meaning the cross associations,</p>
<p>that things could either be rewired randomly</p>
<p>in ways that don&rsquo;t serve us,</p>
<p>or would perhaps just cause no effect at all.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s either going to be bad or neutral,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not really the way things are turning out.</p>
<p>Again, these are highly controlled studies.</p>
<p>I do want to emphasize that ketamine, psilocybin,</p>
<p>these things are still illegal, most all places.</p>
<p>There are some regions and cities in the United States</p>
<p>where they are locally decriminalized,</p>
<p>but they are not legal, they&rsquo;re still illegal.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re referring to here are indeed clinical studies</p>
<p>in which people are taking them legally.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very likely we will see a shift</p>
<p>in the legislature around psychedelics,</p>
<p>and in particular psilocybin in the not too distant future.</p>
<p>And I think that for now,</p>
<p>what we should know is what Matt told me,</p>
<p>and what you&rsquo;ll hear far more about,</p>
<p>which is that psilocybin,</p>
<p>this one, or in most cases, two-dose treatments</p>
<p>done in a highly clinical setting, controlled setting,</p>
<p>with patients that are carefully selected,</p>
<p>can, in many cases, the majority of people receive</p>
<p>and maintain relief from their depressive symptoms</p>
<p>simply through the experience of this psychedelic journey.</p>
<p>I did ask him about microdosing.</p>
<p>I made it sound as if I&rsquo;d never heard about it before.</p>
<p>Microdosing, not microdosing.</p>
<p>Microdosing, and his answer was interesting.</p>
<p>His answer was that the microdosing effects</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t seem to be nearly as impactful as some of these,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just call them what they are,</p>
<p>these kind of high-amplitude sessions</p>
<p>that there are just one or two.</p>
<p>There are some studies ongoing where there&rsquo;s more than two,</p>
<p>but that the microdosing doesn&rsquo;t seem to compare</p>
<p>to these macrodosing, I mentioned the dosages before,</p>
<p>this 20 milligrams per 70 kilograms</p>
<p>or 30 milligrams per 70 kilograms dosages</p>
<p>given several weeks apart.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll hear more about microdosing and other psychedelics</p>
<p>and their impact on depressive states</p>
<p>and major depression in the episode with Matt,</p>
<p>but for the time being, it really seems as if, again,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re looking at neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re coming back to layer five,</p>
<p>just like with ketamine and PCP,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re hearing about layer five,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re hearing about rewiring of circuitry,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re hearing about a dissociation</p>
<p>or a distancing of oneself from these negative moods</p>
<p>and affects and narratives,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a key distinction between the ketamine work</p>
<p>and the psilocybin work,</p>
<p>which is that in the ketamine work,</p>
<p>it really is about dissociating from experience</p>
<p>during the session with the psychiatrist,</p>
<p>whereas during the psilocybin journey,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really about immersing oneself in the experience</p>
<p>and being fully present to that experience.</p>
<p>That does seem to be an important component.</p>
<p>And what the difference is there</p>
<p>and why they both seem to provide some relief</p>
<p>from major depression isn&rsquo;t clear.</p>
<p>I think most likely it takes us back to the fact</p>
<p>that this thing we call major depression</p>
<p>clearly involves serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine,</p>
<p>and in some individuals,</p>
<p>they may be more deficient in one or several of those</p>
<p>or all of those, whereas in other individuals,</p>
<p>it might be a different collection of chemicals.</p>
<p>And of course, there are a tremendous number</p>
<p>of other psychedelic compounds that people are exploring</p>
<p>for treatment of major depression,</p>
<p>but really psilocybin is the one</p>
<p>that we have the most data on.</p>
<p>MDMA has mainly been explored in the clinical realm</p>
<p>for treatment of trauma.</p>
<p>There are some trials ongoing for treatment of depression,</p>
<p>but the big breakthroughs seem to be happening</p>
<p>in the realm of trauma treatment,</p>
<p>the so-called MAPS group that&rsquo;s doing this,</p>
<p>again, legally in a clinical setting,</p>
<p>and there are other groups</p>
<p>that are starting to do it as well.</p>
<p>We are going to do an entire podcast episode</p>
<p>about MDMA and some related compounds,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ll save that discussion for then.</p>
<p>One of the most common questions I get for this podcast</p>
<p>is about different diets, different regimes,</p>
<p>different nutritional plans,</p>
<p>things like keto, ketogenic diet, or vegan diets,</p>
<p>or intermittent fasting, or the all-meat diet,</p>
<p>the so-called lion diet, et cetera.</p>
<p>There are actually really interesting data</p>
<p>relating nutrition and diet to major depressive disorder,</p>
<p>and I think we just need to frame this</p>
<p>by returning to something that was said earlier,</p>
<p>which is that the ingestion of carbohydrates,</p>
<p>in particular, carbohydrates and some meats, like turkey,</p>
<p>that are rich in tryptophan, this precursor to serotonin,</p>
<p>are in many ways the self-medicating version</p>
<p>of depression treatment.</p>
<p>Now, to be clear, I&rsquo;m not saying that people</p>
<p>should use food to medicate their depression.</p>
<p>Many people do that reflexively, however.</p>
<p>They reach for carbohydrate-rich foods</p>
<p>to blunt their cortisol, because that&rsquo;s indeed what it does.</p>
<p>It blunts cortisol when you ingest high-carbohydrate foods,</p>
<p>in particular, starchy foods,</p>
<p>and it does increase serotonin,</p>
<p>in particular, if those foods, rather,</p>
<p>are rich in the amino acid tryptophan.</p>
<p>Now, ingesting food is wonderful, and important, and great,</p>
<p>but ingesting excessive foods of any kinds,</p>
<p>carbohydrate or otherwise, is not healthy, of course.</p>
<p>There have been some explorations</p>
<p>of whether or not a vegan diet</p>
<p>can improve symptoms of depression.</p>
<p>Not a lot of data, not impressive data.</p>
<p>There have been very few controlled studies</p>
<p>looking at the carnivore, all-meat diet.</p>
<p>On that, I think there are now some</p>
<p>that are starting to spin up,</p>
<p>meaning the studies are starting to spin up.</p>
<p>However, the ketogenic diet has been explored</p>
<p>for its ability to relieve certain symptoms of depression,</p>
<p>in particular, to what&rsquo;s called maintain euthymia.</p>
<p>Euthymia is the kind of state of equilibrium</p>
<p>between a manic episode and a depressive episode</p>
<p>in a manic bipolar person.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll return to this more in a future episode,</p>
<p>but basically, manics have highs, and they have lows.</p>
<p>Bipolars either cycle back and forth really quickly,</p>
<p>so rapid cycling bipolars, or some people,</p>
<p>so really quickly can be day-to-day.</p>
<p>Other people, it&rsquo;s month-to-month or week-to-week.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going highs and lows.</p>
<p>And you hear about mania, and you hear about dysphoria.</p>
<p>Euthymia is that kind of place in the middle</p>
<p>where people feel neither too high nor too low.</p>
<p>And there are some interesting studies</p>
<p>looking at the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>for maintaining euthymia in manic depressives,</p>
<p>but also in people with major depressive disorder.</p>
<p>Why would this work?</p>
<p>Well, we have to remember that the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t discovered so that self-appointed nutrition gurus</p>
<p>could talk about it online,</p>
<p>or so that people could make money</p>
<p>selling anything related to ketosis.</p>
<p>And here, I&rsquo;m not disparaging of the ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s helped a lot of people.</p>
<p>The ketogenic diet was actually shown</p>
<p>to be medically relevant for its use to treat epilepsy.</p>
<p>It turns out that in epilepsy,</p>
<p>or in particular, pediatric epilepsy,</p>
<p>that a ketogenic diet and the shift of brain metabolism</p>
<p>to predominantly one in which ketones are being metabolized</p>
<p>rather than more standard glucose type metabolism</p>
<p>can greatly reduce the number of epileptic seizures</p>
<p>that these children experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always the case, but it&rsquo;s often the case.</p>
<p>And so you talk to a neurologist or a neurosurgeon</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s specialized in epilepsy,</p>
<p>in particular, pediatric epilepsy,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll tell you this.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, the ketogenic diet, in many cases,</p>
<p>not all can be very effective for this treatment.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>How is it that a ketogenic diet reduces seizures?</p>
<p>Well, the way it reduces seizures</p>
<p>is by increasing what&rsquo;s called GABA transmission.</p>
<p>GABA is a substance that is naturally released in our brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an inhibitory neurotransmitter,</p>
<p>meaning that when it&rsquo;s released into the synapse,</p>
<p>it has the tendency to reduce the firing,</p>
<p>to reduce the electrical activity of the next neuron</p>
<p>or sets of neurons.</p>
<p>There are various compounds that increase GABA,</p>
<p>in particular, GABA in the forebrain.</p>
<p>One common example would be something like alcohol.</p>
<p>Drinking alcoholic drink or two</p>
<p>will increase GABA transmission,</p>
<p>will, ironically, will lower your social inhibitions</p>
<p>by increasing your neurochemical inhibition.</p>
<p>It basically suppresses the self-monitoring pathways.</p>
<p>And if people drink enough,</p>
<p>it will suppress all pathways</p>
<p>and people will urinate themselves and fall over.</p>
<p>It will eventually inhibit all sorts of pathways.</p>
<p>So the GABA system has a rich array of effects</p>
<p>all over the brain and body,</p>
<p>but alcohol tends to activate the release of GABA.</p>
<p>You might say, well, then why not just take alcohol</p>
<p>to suppress seizures?</p>
<p>Well, that would be a terrible idea</p>
<p>because there tends to be a rebound excitability</p>
<p>after alcohol stops having its effects</p>
<p>on the GABA receptors.</p>
<p>And so then there&rsquo;s an excitability</p>
<p>which in epilepsy would be terrible.</p>
<p>The reason why the epileptic diet is useful for epilepsy</p>
<p>is that increases what we call the tonic level,</p>
<p>sort of the tide, the level of GABA in the brain,</p>
<p>and that suppresses some of the hyper-excitability</p>
<p>that is the characteristic feature of epilepsy.</p>
<p>And there are other drugs, for instance,</p>
<p>the benzodiazepines and things of the Xanax variety,</p>
<p>Valium and so forth, those increase GABA transmission.</p>
<p>Those drugs also have a lot of potential</p>
<p>for abuse and addiction, et cetera,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re problematic for other reasons.</p>
<p>But the ketogenic diet,</p>
<p>by way of increasing ketone metabolism</p>
<p>or shifting brain&rsquo;s metabolism over to ketones,</p>
<p>tends to modulate GABA such that GABA is more active</p>
<p>and adjust the so-called GABA glutamate balance.</p>
<p>This is getting technical,</p>
<p>but glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter,</p>
<p>GABA&rsquo;s inhibitory neurotransmitter,</p>
<p>and their balance is vital for neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>for maintaining healthy levels of activity in the brain,</p>
<p>et cetera.</p>
<p>And so there is decent evidence</p>
<p>that people with major depressive disorders,</p>
<p>in particular, the people with major depressive disorders</p>
<p>that are refractory,</p>
<p>meaning they don&rsquo;t respond to classical antidepressants,</p>
<p>can benefit, it seems, from the ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>Now, this is not always the case,</p>
<p>but for those of you out there</p>
<p>who are struggling with major depression</p>
<p>and for which drugs have not worked,</p>
<p>please talk to your psychiatrist.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many of them are up on the literature</p>
<p>about the ketogenic diet or the EPAs and the rest.</p>
<p>You know, psychiatrists are very,</p>
<p>in terms of how involved in the current literature,</p>
<p>they tend to be,</p>
<p>but there are many excellent psychiatrists out there.</p>
<p>Most of them, in my experience,</p>
<p>are actually quite avid learners</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s happening and what&rsquo;s new</p>
<p>in this realm that they call psychiatry.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really interesting that eating in a particular way,</p>
<p>lowering carbohydrates to the point</p>
<p>where you rely on ketogenic metabolism in the brain</p>
<p>increases GABA and can provide some relief</p>
<p>for depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>And that, in particular,</p>
<p>that seems to have positive effects</p>
<p>in people that are refractory</p>
<p>or don&rsquo;t respond to classic antidepressants.</p>
<p>And that would include things like fluoxetine, et cetera.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make one final point about ketogenic diets</p>
<p>and GABA and depression,</p>
<p>which is that it&rsquo;s also been shown</p>
<p>that for people that respond well to these drugs</p>
<p>that impact the serotonin system, dopamine system,</p>
<p>or norepinephrine, the ketogenic diet there</p>
<p>may improve the ability for those drugs</p>
<p>to work at lower dosages,</p>
<p>which is reminiscent of what we saw</p>
<p>with the EPA supplementation.</p>
<p>So today we&rsquo;ve covered what at least feels to me</p>
<p>like a tremendous amount of material.</p>
<p>This topic of depression is indeed an enormous topic</p>
<p>to try and get our arms around.</p>
<p>We talked about the symptomology.</p>
<p>We talked about some of the underlying neurochemistry</p>
<p>and biology, and then we talked about approaches</p>
<p>to deal with it that are really grounded</p>
<p>in the neurochemistry and biology.</p>
<p>I just want to recap a few of those tools</p>
<p>and what those things are.</p>
<p>First of all, we talked about making the effort</p>
<p>to not overwhelm the pleasure system.</p>
<p>That might seem counterintuitive</p>
<p>to not overly seek out pleasure</p>
<p>or else one can find themselves in a place of depression.</p>
<p>I mentioned way back at the beginning of the episode,</p>
<p>a young man who I know to be really struggling</p>
<p>with depression, and it is thought,</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t know for sure,</p>
<p>but it is thought that some of that depression</p>
<p>was probably triggered by an overindulgence in video games</p>
<p>and other highly dopaminergic activities</p>
<p>to the point where those activities</p>
<p>eventually were countered by the pain balance</p>
<p>that Dr. Anna Lembke described.</p>
<p>And he now has to do those activities repeatedly</p>
<p>and for many, many hours each day just to feel okay,</p>
<p>not even to derive pleasure from them.</p>
<p>And worse, many other activities,</p>
<p>practically all other activities have lost their zest,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve lost their excitement</p>
<p>and his sense of pleasure for them.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a really active campaign now</p>
<p>to reset that system.</p>
<p>So number one, don&rsquo;t overwhelm your pleasure centers</p>
<p>either through activities or compounds.</p>
<p>It might seem counterintuitive,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re setting yourself up for anhedonia and depression</p>
<p>if you do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about addiction, that too,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also about setting yourself</p>
<p>for anhedonia and depression.</p>
<p>How often can you engage in these activities?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s going to differ from person to person,</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s slightly different,</p>
<p>but you should really mind your extreme highs</p>
<p>and your extreme lows and be cautious about those.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll probably have Dr. Lembke on again at a future time</p>
<p>to try and get some more specifics about that.</p>
<p>But if you do feel like you need to reset that system,</p>
<p>it really does seem like a 30-day complete detox</p>
<p>from whatever activity or substance that is,</p>
<p>and ideally it doesn&rsquo;t continue after that 30 days,</p>
<p>especially in conditions of drugs of abuse.</p>
<p>Second of all, talked about the norepinephrine system</p>
<p>and how the norepinephrine system is really deficient</p>
<p>in many forms of major depression and in depression.</p>
<p>There is now more deliberate pursuit</p>
<p>of norepinephrine-inducing activities that are healthy,</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t adrenaline-seeking per se,</p>
<p>things like cold showers,</p>
<p>things like particular patterns of breathing</p>
<p>that engage and tend to make us more alert,</p>
<p>things like exercise that will increase</p>
<p>our levels of noradrenaline.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be remiss if I said that these activities</p>
<p>could completely eliminate depressive symptoms</p>
<p>in people with major depressive disorder.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>And again, I want to acknowledge that people</p>
<p>with major depressive symptoms often don&rsquo;t have the energy,</p>
<p>the willingness, or the capacity to engage</p>
<p>in some of these activities,</p>
<p>but things like cold showers, deliberate cold showers,</p>
<p>things like regular exercise,</p>
<p>they aren&rsquo;t just feel-good activities.</p>
<p>They actually engage the norepinephrine system</p>
<p>and keep that system tuned up</p>
<p>and allow us to increase our norepinephrine levels</p>
<p>at will on a regular basis.</p>
<p>And their mood-enhancing effects are real effects</p>
<p>that at the level of neurochemistry.</p>
<p>Then we talked about EPAs.</p>
<p>These essential fatty acids.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s clear that for most people,</p>
<p>getting above 1,000 milligrams</p>
<p>and probably even closer to 2,000 milligrams per day</p>
<p>of EPAs can be beneficial for mood,</p>
<p>especially in attempts to treat</p>
<p>or offset major depressive disorder.</p>
<p>Are there side effects?</p>
<p>Well, you need to explore those for yourself</p>
<p>and with your doctor.</p>
<p>Everyone has a different health background.</p>
<p>The margins of safety for most people</p>
<p>will probably be quite large,</p>
<p>but for some people that might not be the case.</p>
<p>So definitely check with your physician.</p>
<p>We also talked about exercise</p>
<p>and how EPA and exercise on a regular basis</p>
<p>can offset these inflammatory pathways.</p>
<p>I want to mention something I&rsquo;ve mentioned</p>
<p>on a previous podcast,</p>
<p>but in terms of keeping the inflammatome,</p>
<p>all these molecules that create inflammation,</p>
<p>and then the inflammation can limit the amount of serotonin</p>
<p>through the pathways we described.</p>
<p>In order to do that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also very, very useful to ingest two to four servings</p>
<p>of fermented foods on a daily basis or near daily basis.</p>
<p>These are data that were published</p>
<p>by the Sonnenberg Lab at Stanford,</p>
<p>recently in the journal Cell,</p>
<p>Cell Press Journal, excellent journal,</p>
<p>that ingestion of these fermented foods</p>
<p>really keeps the gut microbiome tuned up, so to speak,</p>
<p>well in order to offset these inflammatory cytokines.</p>
<p>Keeping inflammation at bay,</p>
<p>it just turns out to be a really good thing</p>
<p>in order to keep our mood in a good place.</p>
<p>So EPA, exercise, fermented foods,</p>
<p>creatine as a potential source of relief from depression</p>
<p>or offsetting or keeping us away from major depression</p>
<p>or relapse into depression.</p>
<p>And then we talked about the prescription compounds</p>
<p>and the compounds that are being used mainly</p>
<p>in the course of studies and of psychiatry and depression,</p>
<p>things like ketamine, PCP, psilocybin and related compounds.</p>
<p>And then lastly, we talked about ketosis,</p>
<p>which may not be right for everybody,</p>
<p>but might be right for certain individuals out there</p>
<p>who are grappling with this.</p>
