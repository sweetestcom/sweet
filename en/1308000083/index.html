    <p>This is our BG Squared panel.</p>
<p>Everybody knows Friends of the Pod, Brad Gerstner, and Bill Gurley.</p>
<p>Give it up for our guests.</p>
<p>Bill, you predicted five of the last three recessions.</p>
<p>A broken clock is still right twice a day.</p>
<p>I mean, here we are again.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve sounded the alarm bell, and of course you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve seen this movie before.</p>
<p>For all of us younger capital allocators who are experiencing it for the second or</p>
<p>third time, but you&rsquo;ve experienced it a couple more times, I mean, it&rsquo;s pretty old.</p>
<p>How does this one measure up to Great Recession, dot-com bust, you know, 87, and the many ones</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen in between?</p>
<p>You know, one thing that I think&rsquo;s super important to put this into context, I&rsquo;ll try and tell</p>
<p>this quick.</p>
<p>I had a meeting once with Howard Marks, who I&rsquo;d wanted to meet for a long period of time.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a famous bond investor that does a lot of writing.</p>
<p>And for 15 minutes, he asked me questions about the venture industry, a lot of structural</p>
<p>questions.</p>
<p>And I told him my answer as best I could.</p>
<p>And he said, man, that&rsquo;s a really shitty industry.</p>
<p>And I said, well, why do you say that, what do you mean?</p>
<p>He says, you know, cyclical collapse is built into the structure.</p>
<p>And so we have funds that, you know, are taken, you know, committed to that have 10 to 15</p>
<p>year lives.</p>
<p>So you have low barriers to entry, but you have very high barriers to exit.</p>
<p>And so he felt that it was just systematically set up to rise and crash, rise and crash.</p>
<p>And one thing that I realized coming out of that is that it doesn&rsquo;t happen like a sine</p>
<p>curve, which is what we all imagine when we think of a cyclical business.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like a sawtooth.</p>
<p>Risk on is a very slow process and it&rsquo;s reflexive.</p>
<p>So it grows and grows and grows and grows.</p>
<p>And then risk off tends to be very abrupt.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve seen that here, right?</p>
<p>This cycle, risk on was from 2009 to five months ago.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really well said.</p>
<p>And risk off is five months.</p>
<p>And the thing that&rsquo;s really tough about that is it requires mental adjustment very quickly,</p>
<p>because it didn&rsquo;t gradually change, it abruptly changed.</p>
<p>And so, you know, cap charts might have, you know, systematic issues that are stuck because</p>
<p>too much lick prep relative to the new reality.</p>
<p>Valuations have shifted.</p>
<p>Cost of capital is radically different.</p>
<p>You may have, you know, on the way up as risk got, people took more risk, you tried</p>
<p>crazier things, you&rsquo;re willing to make investments in businesses you might not if the cost of</p>
<p>capital is a lot lower.</p>
<p>You name a stadium for five years as a crypto company.</p>
<p>You might do that.</p>
<p>And then, but then all of a sudden it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>And now the commitment to naming the stadium is greater than the market gap.</p>
<p>Well, that may not be true for FTX, but.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, just as an example, it might be a disproportionate value of your, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So anyway, it&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>And in this particular case, because that&rsquo;s what you asked, so it turns out 2009 wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that bad.</p>
<p>If we have an 2009, that&rsquo;ll be pretty good.</p>
<p>Things got turned around pretty quickly.</p>
<p>2001 was very abrupt and we didn&rsquo;t, you know, really start to see liquidity again until,</p>
<p>with a few exceptions, Elon mentioned PayPal, but like 05, 06, you know, it was a long walk</p>
<p>in the desert.</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of great companies were started, but a lot of founders gave up at that time.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And look, I mean, I think to the, if you&rsquo;re an early stage investor or if you&rsquo;re an early</p>
<p>stage founder, that&rsquo;s just getting going or even an early stage company, because if you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t scaled out yet, this probably hasn&rsquo;t affected you.</p>
<p>It could be, it could be wonderful.</p>
<p>Like your access to talent is going to be a lot easier.</p>
<p>People are going to be more pragmatic and rational, but it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s usually a long</p>
<p>window on the other side.</p>
<p>The other, the other challenge you have here is in 20, I mean, we basically had a mini</p>
<p>pullback in March of 2020, but then the Fed hit so hard that things just blasted off again.</p>
<p>And now, and now you guys have talked about this, but that tool is not in the toolbox</p>
<p>anymore.</p>
<p>Brad.</p>
<p>So one of the things I was talking to somebody last night, and this audience is amazing.</p>
<p>I was talking to somebody last night and they said, you know, so how does it work?</p>
<p>You just get together and talk.</p>
<p>And I said, you know, what I&rsquo;m, what I love about this group is there are hundreds of</p>
<p>hours of like data and research that we&rsquo;re constantly challenged with.</p>
<p>We all know where we are.</p>
<p>We know what just happened.</p>
<p>And I think grounding ourselves in just a few facts to try to figure out what the next</p>
<p>six months are going to be, because we have founders here trying to run their businesses.</p>
<p>When I raised capital, are we bouncing straight back from where we were?</p>
<p>So very quickly, this chart just tells us, you know, the iron law of investing is interest</p>
<p>rates.</p>
<p>A 1% change in rates leads to a 15 or 20% change in a multiple.</p>
<p>And so the reason multiples have collapsed here for all these businesses is because expectations</p>
<p>as to inflation and rates has changed dramatically.</p>
<p>I hear a lot of talk about 1999, 2000.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s all about rates, let&rsquo;s just look at those two things.</p>
<p>We plotted them here together.</p>
<p>This is 19 to 22 on the bottom.</p>
<p>It shows what rates did.</p>
<p>We took them to zero.</p>
<p>The Fed is now saying our neutral rate is two to 3% and people are hyperventilating.</p>
<p>Look at where we were in 2000.</p>
<p>Look at what the cost of capital was in 2000.</p>
<p>Crazy, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so this, this idea, and by the way, the Delta there.</p>
<p>We went from just above five up to six and a half, right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about going from two and a half back to two and a half or three.</p>
<p>But the big question is, are we going back to two and a half or three, or are they behind</p>
<p>the curve, lost in the weeds, and we&rsquo;re going to have to go to four to five to kill inflation?</p>
<p>Well, everybody was saying inflation, you know, inflation is here to stay forever.</p>
<p>Remember, when we report on core CPI, it&rsquo;s what happened last month.</p>
<p>It is not a forward-looking indicator.</p>
<p>So we peaked in core CPI.</p>
<p>Consumer price index, explain what it is.</p>
<p>Consumer price.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the basket of goods and services that we all go out and spend money on.</p>
<p>So the Fed is focused on the demand side of the equation.</p>
<p>They know they hopped us up on a bunch of Red Bull and cocaine to survive the pandemic.</p>
<p>And now.</p>
<p>I thought you were talking about last night for sacks, but keep going.</p>
<p>You still haven&rsquo;t said a word all day, look at you.</p>
<p>You are so gagged.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to get through it, Sachs.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to get through it together, OK?</p>
<p>You are so ragged.</p>
<p>So this chart, this chart, we deconstructed 20 bank models to say, what are the components</p>
<p>of CPI?</p>
<p>How do they differ?</p>
<p>The red line is where Goldman thinks we&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>The green line is UBS.</p>
<p>I just told you the Fed thinks we&rsquo;ll exit the year at four.</p>
<p>We just decelerated significantly.</p>
<p>And when they look at May in June, it&rsquo;s going to be down yet further.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s going to be down.</p>
<p>When the Fed stimulated the economy, all the prices we pay for everything went haywire.</p>
<p>OK, the price for a used car was 20,000 bucks for 10 years.</p>
<p>And then just coincidentally, they give us a bunch of Red Bull and the price goes to</p>
<p>twenty nine thousand dollars.</p>
<p>For two months in a row, we&rsquo;ve had sequential declines.</p>
<p>You tell me, is the price of the used car this time next year higher than twenty nine</p>
<p>or lower than twenty nine?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be lower because we&rsquo;re destroying demand by raising interest rates.</p>
<p>Same for home prices.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s plotted here is the home affordability index.</p>
<p>Somebody who can afford to pay twelve hundred dollars a month in December could afford a</p>
<p>three hundred and fifty thousand dollar home today can afford a two hundred and forty thousand</p>
<p>dollar home.</p>
<p>You tell me, are the number of new home searches on Zillow going up or down?</p>
<p>Go run your Google Trends.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going down because people&rsquo;s ability to buy homes is going down.</p>
<p>And then finally, airline tickets.</p>
<p>Same deal.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so when you put that all together, you say, OK, sequentially, month over month, forward</p>
<p>looking.</p>
<p>This stuff&rsquo;s starting to tip over.</p>
<p>If you look at what consumer confidence is, it&rsquo;s the lowest in 10 years.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Consumer confidence is a leading indicator of slowing down.</p>
<p>So again, everybody on television is telling us about what just happened.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the nightly news, big red arrows, inflation going up.</p>
<p>This is what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>And what we all care about is what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>We destroyed 15 trillion.</p>
<p>You said this on pod 80.</p>
<p>We destroyed 15 trillion of household net worth in the last five months.</p>
<p>So the expected path of household net worth would have taken us from one hundred and ten</p>
<p>trillion to one hundred and twenty five trillion over the course of the last two years.</p>
<p>That was the trend we were on.</p>
<p>Instead, we got all hopped up and went from 110 to 142.</p>
<p>But now we&rsquo;re all the way back to 127.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I call on path, on trend.</p>
<p>So the Fed has done exactly what it wanted to do.</p>
<p>It ruined all the SPACs.</p>
<p>It ruined every took all the juice.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So it took the juice out of the system and consumer confidence tells me forward looking</p>
<p>inflation is rolling.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Bernanke says this morning or over the weekend, he said, ignore what you everybody</p>
<p>else is saying.</p>
<p>Follow the tips.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been saying this since May of last year.</p>
<p>So this is the break even.</p>
<p>This is the bond market.</p>
<p>When that goes positive, that means the bond market is saying that inflation is rolling</p>
<p>over because this is the 10 year less inflation.</p>
<p>And so now we have anecdotal information about cars, about houses, about air.</p>
<p>We have our common sense.</p>
<p>We know that those prices are not sustainable and we have the bond market telling us the</p>
<p>same thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t think you should believe the hyperinflation narrative.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on NFTs?</p>
<p>I mean, here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>What about my board ape?</p>
<p>What will happen to that?</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re going through this and you start to understand the logic of it, you realize</p>
<p>what a mirage we were in, that certain assets that had no underlying value, you know, they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t cars, airline tickets or homes, were also being exacerbated during all of this.</p>
<p>And I think that was probably one of the things that made this less fun in this cycle.</p>
<p>Bill, you&rsquo;re a fundamental investor.</p>
<p>You really think about consumers.</p>
<p>You think about the total addressable market.</p>
<p>You give a lot of thoughts to that.</p>
<p>What was the last couple of years like when, because you were saying three or four years</p>
<p>ago, hey, this is kind of disconnecting from reality.</p>
<p>You know, back when I had that conversation with Howard, I started doing some more research.</p>
<p>I went back and I talked to some of our fund of funds that have data over a very long period</p>
<p>of time.</p>
<p>And, I mean, this sounds ridiculous, but what I realized was that the IRR numbers and the</p>
<p>ROI numbers on the venture capital category were heavily dependent on performance in the</p>
<p>hottest part of the cycle.</p>
<p>And so in the tip of that sawtooth.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when we came up with this phrase that the best way to protect yourself against</p>
<p>the downside is to enjoy every last bit of the upside.</p>
<p>So while you get anxious about the rollover, you actually can&rsquo;t afford, as a venture capital</p>
<p>firm, and maybe this contributes to the collapse as fast as it does.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t afford not to play the game because it&rsquo;s too hard to predict when it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>change.</p>
<p>Bill, there&rsquo;s $250 billion of committed capital unallocated into companies.</p>
<p>What happens in the cycle over the next five years if there is this expectation that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not going to be in the good part of the risk-on part of the curve?</p>
<p>That capital needs to be deployed at this point in the cycle.</p>
<p>And do we end up having these crazy bifurcations in the market where high-quality companies</p>
<p>get 10x evaluation of the mean and all the money plows into a few companies that are</p>
<p>kind of outperforming?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you some quick thoughts.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the dynamic?</p>
<p>And I know Brad has some too because we were talking about this this morning.</p>
<p>First of all, I&rsquo;ve never ever felt as a venture investor that I have to invest money.</p>
<p>And if you remember, most of it&rsquo;s committed but not drawn down.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re going to have to go ask for it.</p>
<p>If you deployed two-thirds of your fund into crypto assets with no board seat in the past</p>
<p>12 months, are you going to call Harvard and Penn and say, hey, I need some more right now?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re going to make that call.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t, no.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying they&rsquo;d let the capital sit there and never call it?</p>
<p>You guys were talking about this on one of the recent pods.</p>
<p>In 01, a lot of people actually returned the commitment.</p>
<p>And it was actually an act of greed, not an act of&hellip;</p>
<p>It came across like they were being nice.</p>
<p>But they were getting out, I call it the burnt waffle theory, they were killing the fund</p>
<p>and getting out of the overhang and starting fresh, just like, I guess it was Melvin that</p>
<p>attempted to do as a version of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a recap, in a way.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, they just want to get started without the overhang of the look back.</p>
<p>They deployed 200 or 300 million.</p>
<p>I think one thing, Bill, not to interrupt.</p>
<p>The assumption of the question was, will they be forced to deploy capital into a really</p>
<p>bad vintage?</p>
<p>I actually think the upcoming vintage is going to start getting real.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a good vintage.</p>
<p>I think that was Bill&rsquo;s point.</p>
<p>I think we both feel that way.</p>
<p>I think the vintage of the last 18 months will be lousy.</p>
<p>So the capital deployed over the last 18 months won&rsquo;t have a lot of return.</p>
<p>All of our LPs know it.</p>
<p>I was just sitting with an LP, one of my investors at lunch today.</p>
<p>Imagine this.</p>
<p>They have 50 investments like Benchmark and Altimeter.</p>
<p>All of them are going down.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re going to call them up and say, I want all this money right now to go invest</p>
<p>in a bunch of stuff that still may not yet have corrected enough.</p>
<p>These are partnerships.</p>
<p>Partnership means a partnership with me and my partners, all the people who gave me the</p>
<p>money.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to put our partners in a headlock and drag their money into the market and put</p>
<p>it into things that we don&rsquo;t think accurately reflect the new world order.</p>
<p>If you go back to that first chart, you can underwrite to the 5-year average, the 10-year</p>
<p>average where we&rsquo;ve been.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re going back to trend.</p>
<p>But you cannot underwrite to where we were last year.</p>
<p>Disabuse yourself.</p>
<p>Bill tweeted this last week.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s spot on.</p>
<p>The biggest mistake we will all make is to anchor ourselves to prices that we saw in</p>
<p>the world over the last 18 months.</p>
<p>Pretend you never saw them.</p>
<p>Not in venture, not in the stock market, because that is a delusional place to think we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting back there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not unless we have another pandemic or a nuclear war and rates go to zero and</p>
<p>then we have bigger problems.</p>
<p>So re-underwrite and underwrite to the 5-year average de novo for all your businesses.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you survive through this and ultimately come out winning.</p>
<p>The other point I would make, David, is that the new reality is apparent to all of us because</p>
<p>of public comps.</p>
<p>So, like, you just have a new world order.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s very hard.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, I mean, there might be someone so sloppy that they just keep investing headstrong.</p>
<p>But I think most of them look at where things are in the type of business that you&rsquo;re investing</p>
<p>in and they feel like they want to make a return.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re using the right word.</p>
<p>It is borderline, well, it&rsquo;s definitely unprofessional and it&rsquo;s borderline idiotic for anybody with</p>
<p>organized capital right now to be ripping money in because you don&rsquo;t know what the terminal</p>
<p>valuation of a business is.</p>
<p>Like at the end of the day, investing is like a line.</p>
<p>It starts here with guys like Jason and it ends here with guys like me and Brad, say.</p>
<p>And in the middle are these guys that are helping along the way and it&rsquo;s all hot potato.</p>
<p>By the time the hot potato gets to us, there is a price and that price has alternatives.</p>
<p>Meaning, if you come to me and say, this thing is worth $10 and I say, actually, no, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worth two because that other thing, which is better than you, is actually worth five.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happened in the stock market.</p>
<p>By the time you get the potato, you put it on the scale.</p>
<p>There is a terminal end point to valuation, right?</p>
<p>At the end of the day, there&rsquo;s a buyer of last resort and that is the public market</p>
<p>investor.</p>
<p>And he and she has said, no mas.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what this chart says, no mas.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t tell me that your thing is worth 50 times, 80 times, 90 times.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth 5.6 times.</p>
<p>I saw something this morning from Morgan Stanley that said, if, however, you&rsquo;re a massive grower,</p>
<p>50% plus grower, there&rsquo;s 30 companies in the SAS index that grow, but only 30 in the entire</p>
<p>world that grow above 50%.</p>
<p>You know what that multiple is?</p>
<p>Just take a wild guess.</p>
<p>8.5.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re not talking 50 times.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking 5.6 or 8.6.</p>
<p>So all of a sudden, the band is this.</p>
<p>So those games, to your point, are over.</p>
<p>I mean, growing by 50% a year, for those of you guys that build businesses that do it,</p>
<p>that is still very hard.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s massive compounding.</p>
<p>So the game is over.</p>
<p>And the idea that there&rsquo;s a quarter trillion, I think that that&rsquo;s a fallacy.</p>
<p>What do you think ultimately gets deployed to the quarter trillion?</p>
<p>Just pick a number.</p>
<p>50.</p>
<p>What do you say?</p>
<p>Over the next three years?</p>
<p>Of the quarter trillion, I think you&rsquo;re probably counting 50% of that as private equity or</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>Maybe 70%.</p>
<p>Yeah, probably right.</p>
<p>Traditional private equity.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Leverage buyout firms are going to have a field day.</p>
<p>Field day.</p>
<p>I mean, so Toma Bravo and all these guys, they will spend all of that.</p>
<p>You tell me what percentage of that.</p>
<p>Of the VC, of the $100 billion of VC, I would say 20.</p>
<p>$20 billion goes in in the next three years?</p>
<p>25 or 30%.</p>
<p>Depends on price adjustment.</p>
<p>I wish we had the numbers from a one, because you had similar things where the raise amounts</p>
<p>were going up.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s frigging tiny, right?</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re saying $25 billion over three years, that&rsquo;s like $8 billion of total</p>
<p>VC dollars deployed a year.</p>
<p>Which, you know, to your trend line thing, I wonder if you went back six years where</p>
<p>that number was.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be candid.</p>
<p>What number of people at these companies is necessary to run them?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking at a Twitter with 8,000.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking at a Google.</p>
<p>And even some of the startups, they got fat.</p>
<p>And they had huge salaries, and there was no essentialism or discipline.</p>
<p>We just talked about a whole CapEx cycle, and a need for hardware, and a need for capital</p>
<p>equipment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole semiconductor space.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s biotech.</p>
<p>I mean, a huge segment of that venture market, Jason, is not software.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very capital-intensive businesses, which, by the way, are really critical in this economic</p>
<p>space.</p>
<p>People have been living high on the hog.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>No, but I like, for example, our investing focus, we&rsquo;ve moved in the last 18 months</p>
<p>to focus a lot on these things.</p>
<p>Lithium mines.</p>
<p>I mean, the stuff that we&rsquo;re doing seems insane.</p>
<p>If you had asked me, would you be sweating a mine in India, you know, and sending our</p>
<p>CFO and a partner to go and make sure the mine exists, I never would have thought that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>But the reason is because of this chart.</p>
<p>Because those trade-offs on dollars make so much more sense.</p>
<p>To put money into an over-bloated software business comes with a lot of baggage.</p>
<p>Valuation baggage, team baggage, technical cruft.</p>
<p>All of these things have to get balanced, and so if you get a really cheap deal, you</p>
<p>do it.</p>
<p>Super interesting.</p>
<p>Bill, I mean, you&rsquo;re like the software guru.</p>
<p>I mean, like, do you feel the same way?</p>
<p>I mean, yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll call it, yeah.</p>
<p>Actually, I want to make a quick comment on, especially with this slide on SaaS multiples.</p>
<p>So obviously, it&rsquo;s a price-to-revenue-multiple slide, and price-to-revenue is, like, this</p>
<p>really crude valuation tool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, like, the crudest you could possibly have.</p>
<p>I published a blog post once where I took all the internet stocks and laid them beginning</p>
<p>to end on a price-to-revenue-multiple, and it was, like, just a massive diversion.</p>
<p>There is no such thing.</p>
<p>And so what really values companies, you know, it&rsquo;s typically a discount of cash flows.</p>
<p>And so now, all of a sudden, the buy side&rsquo;s asking SaaS companies about net dollar retention,</p>
<p>about long-term operating margin, about whether their free cash flow is greater or less than</p>
<p>their net income, about SBC as a percentage of free cash flow.</p>
<p>Stock-based comp.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So all of a sudden, you know, everyone&rsquo;s brought out the microscope on how they&rsquo;re evaluating</p>
<p>these companies and these crude tools that maybe the only, like, there are entrepreneurs</p>
<p>who probably think the only way you measure is SaaS.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>By the way, you&rsquo;re, you know, the companies that, you know, in your example, were all</p>
<p>of a sudden run away with it and get all the money, think about the problem they have.</p>
<p>Their growth is going to slow.</p>
<p>Rate limit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Nobody grows at 500% when you&rsquo;re at a billion dollars.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re lucky to grow at 25%, 30%, OK?</p>
<p>So when your growth is slowing and your valuation is outsized, like, you were going to get to</p>
<p>$5 billion, how do they attract more capital?</p>
<p>This is why this whole game is very complicated right now.</p>
<p>There was also something that took hold over the course of the last two years, specifically</p>
<p>with respect to software, that this was an easy business.</p>
<p>You just send us your data, I pop out a term sheet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s formulaic as though all software companies are created equal.</p>
<p>And you guys asked a question last week on the pod, how many software companies are actually</p>
<p>over a billion dollars in revenue?</p>
<p>How many are over two billion?</p>
<p>Well, we actually went and counted.</p>
<p>Oh, good.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>We counted companies over two billion in revenue.</p>
<p>We got to 21, OK?</p>
<p>There are only 21 that are worth more than $25 billion in all the public markets of all</p>
<p>the millions of software companies that have been started.</p>
<p>But what happened last year was you could be making dog walking software, OK, and somebody</p>
<p>looked at your multiple and slapped 100x on it and said you were worth that as though</p>
<p>that was the equivalent of building a database that would disrupt the entire database market.</p>
<p>So the thing that is returning to markets is something that we all do for a living called</p>
<p>dispersion.</p>
<p>Some shit&rsquo;s going to be really great and the rest is going to be below the mean.</p>
<p>And if you look at software, the history of software, right, is that there are very, very</p>
<p>few companies that ever get to a billion dollars in revenue.</p>
<p>And so if you were slapping 100x ARR revenue or multiple on a company doing 50 million</p>
<p>in revenue, it&rsquo;s highly likely that they will never see that price again, whatever you paid</p>
<p>for that asset, because the dilution and the deceleration in their growth rate will absolutely</p>
<p>eviscerate any return you have as an investor.</p>
<p>And so when you&rsquo;re looking at this, back to your point, you know, not only are we looking</p>
<p>at revenue multiples, but we&rsquo;re also looking at something like Snowflake and saying now</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing 15% free cash flow and expanding those multiples.</p>
<p>All that stuff is critical.</p>
<p>Gurley, do you think it&rsquo;s weird that VCs don&rsquo;t try to underwrite lower valuations?</p>
<p>Like the incentive is always to up your valuation.</p>
<p>Even if the company&rsquo;s performing plan, you don&rsquo;t generally do these like market driven</p>
<p>value.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, you&rsquo;re worth 500 million last round.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll give you a billion dollars this round.</p>
<p>And are we going to see more VCs do down rounds?</p>
<p>I just think that in companies that they&rsquo;re in, there&rsquo;s no VC club where they get together</p>
<p>and discuss how they&rsquo;re going to behave.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re looking at it.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, as that risk on goes slowly up and up and up, you know, and especially</p>
<p>in Silicon Valley, we&rsquo;ve had a systematic shift of power from the investor to the founder</p>
<p>over a very long period of time.</p>
<p>People are friendly because they want deep flow.</p>
<p>So nobody does it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about that.</p>
<p>So interesting.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve seen deals happen where, you know, one term sheet seems great for all shareholders.</p>
<p>And then this term sheet includes some secondary for the founders and no governance seems pretty</p>
<p>great for the founders.</p>
<p>And somehow this one magically wins.</p>
<p>And somebody wins the deal by not taking a board seat.</p>
<p>You know, in the three decades you&rsquo;ve been doing this now, I think it&rsquo;s three or four.</p>
<p>Going into the fourth.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>It might be going into the fourth.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in the fourth decade.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in the fourth decade.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You know, when you when you look at governance, what is the mistake we&rsquo;ve made over this last</p>
<p>bull run?</p>
<p>Well, once again.</p>
<p>What should it be?</p>
<p>Well, I think, I mean.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the right partnership?</p>
<p>I think what it should be is that the market gets to decide.</p>
<p>So if, you know, if someone wants, if someone can raise, you know, $100 million with no</p>
<p>board seat, no rights, and they want that, I think they should be able to do that.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So what is the best interest of our industry, of all shareholders, the employees, the industry</p>
<p>at large?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not dodging the question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just super complicated.</p>
<p>We put money behind Rich Barton, as both of us did, and he had super voting.</p>
<p>But he also, I think, is very honorable about his duty to shareholders.</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>There was a track record there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t, it never, it never was an issue in the entire history of the company.</p>
<p>And so, you know, but, you know, if there&rsquo;s a first time founder that&rsquo;s doing that, like,</p>
<p>you know, who knows?</p>
<p>Who knows what the motivation is?</p>
<p>And but, but once again, it&rsquo;s a market.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a free market.</p>
<p>And I think that there are certain people or founders that decide, hey, you bring something</p>
<p>to the table that I want.</p>
<p>And I understand there&rsquo;s a government&rsquo;s requirement to it.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll opt into that.</p>
<p>And, you know, willing buyer meets willing seller.</p>
<p>Gurley, what do you guys, Brett, what is your attitude when you guys actually have a win?</p>
<p>You do the job, company goes public, and you have the chance to distribute to your LPs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a movement in Silicon Valley where some firms have said, you know what,</p>
<p>guys, I&rsquo;m going to hold this forever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to create permanent capital structures, evergreen funds.</p>
<p>You know, if, you know, you foundation want a distribution from me, just tell me and I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>give you money magically somehow, etc, etc.</p>
<p>What do you guys think about that versus just distributing and walking away, booking the</p>
<p>win?</p>
<p>And if you want to hold the stock, you just hold it in your own private.</p>
<p>Let me just start by saying that investing is really fucking hard.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a lot of ways you can lose, you know, and when you guys started</p>
<p>the podcast, I was listening to one of the episodes today, and it really hit me.</p>
<p>In the song that you put together, David says, let your renters ride.</p>
<p>And so from the brief history of the podcast, you&rsquo;ve gone from talking about that as a strategy</p>
<p>to this question that you&rsquo;ve posed to me, which is on the opposite end of my defense.</p>
<p>We have all these great minds here, so I thought I&rsquo;d give him a chance to talk like some of</p>
<p>the people on the pod who like to hear themselves talk a little bit too much.</p>
<p>He was resting his eyes.</p>
<p>He was resting his eyes.</p>
<p>All right, now, in fairness, we had that conversation.</p>
<p>As I recall, the context was that way back when, like, for example, when I had Facebook</p>
<p>and Facebook went public, the urge was just to sell it all.</p>
<p>And so I think where we landed on that was don&rsquo;t sell 100 percent, keep 20 percent, keep</p>
<p>50 percent.</p>
<p>But that was you personally.</p>
<p>It was schmuck insurance, basically.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that was for you personally as an investment.</p>
<p>What about you as a fund manager?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think for me as a fund manager.</p>
<p>So I think we did a pretty good job over the last six months distributing out some</p>
<p>gains, some realizations.</p>
<p>We actually paid back our whole first fund.</p>
<p>But in our second fund, we had about $120 million of a firm stock, and we were sitting</p>
<p>on it because we believe in the company and still do, and we&rsquo;re still sitting on it.</p>
<p>And that was like a $100 million mistake.</p>
<p>So I think, you know, what&rsquo;s my attitude from now on?</p>
<p>Honestly, my attitude from now on is probably going to be distribute it.</p>
<p>So my first chance to actually return any real money to our LPs was when Slack did our</p>
<p>direct listing.</p>
<p>And it was like, you know, there are three or four of us on the board, me, Andrew Brach</p>
<p>at Excel, John O&rsquo;Farrell from Andreessen, two independents, and Stuart.</p>
<p>And they had gone through a couple direct listings before, bring in our bankers, and</p>
<p>they go through this whole rigmarole.</p>
<p>And I remember being so amped up in the whole thing.</p>
<p>And I thought, oh, I believe in this company, I believe in all of this, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Long story short, the point is, I held the stock.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t distribute it.</p>
<p>The pandemic hit.</p>
<p>I then distributed in sheer panic.</p>
<p>And we left a lot of money on the table that I could have just booked the win for the LPs.</p>
<p>And then from that point, I said, never again, I&rsquo;ll hold it for myself.</p>
<p>But the minute that I get a distribution, if I&rsquo;m in the business of managing money for</p>
<p>other people, it&rsquo;s out the door when it&rsquo;s liquid.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll be happy to take a point of view for my own shares.</p>
<p>But I felt so stupid, I took a 50% loss trying to be a hero.</p>
<p>And then also, we have the issue of selling in secondary when those opportunities arise.</p>
<p>And we all just watched the We Crashed documentary, which one of your partners plays a role in.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Obviously, it&rsquo;s probably 5% reality.</p>
<p>But Benchmark did make a pretty amazing trade in selling WeWork shares early and booking</p>
<p>an enormous win, correct, Bill?</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So just an alternative.</p>
<p>Wait, what&rsquo;s the answer to the question?</p>
<p>What do you distribute or not distribute?</p>
<p>Yes, I was going to give you the answer.</p>
<p>So three WeWork asides, secondary options.</p>
<p>So to me, the most important thing is, if you&rsquo;re in the business of managing money for</p>
<p>other people, it&rsquo;s out the door when those opportunities arise.</p>
<p>And then from that point, I said, never again, I&rsquo;ll hold it for myself.</p>
<p>But the minute that I get a distribution, if I&rsquo;m in the business of managing money for</p>
<p>other people, it&rsquo;s out the door when those opportunities arise.</p>
<p>And then from that point, I said, what do you distribute or not distribute?</p>
<p>Yes, I was going to give you the answer.</p>
<p>So to me, the most important thing is, tell your partners what you&rsquo;re going to do, and</p>
<p>then do it.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re making a deal upfront.</p>
<p>So for us, the deal was, if we invest in something in our venture fund, and it&rsquo;s realized it</p>
<p>goes public, if we see venture-like returns, which we define with them as 2 to 3x over</p>
<p>a three-year time horizon, we will hold.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t, we distribute it.</p>
<p>Last year, we distributed over $6 billion, which was more than all the venture we raised</p>
<p>in our first five funds.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Not because I didn&rsquo;t like Unity, or I didn&rsquo;t like Snowflake.</p>
<p>Everybody knows how we feel about these businesses.</p>
<p>But because we realized that, according to the deal we had made with our partners, the</p>
<p>framework was triggered.</p>
<p>And the second thing I would argue is, because people are talking about permanent funds now</p>
<p>and all this, I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s the deal people made.</p>
<p>For me, if you&rsquo;re an investor or a limited partner in our fund, and you want to hold</p>
<p>on to it, then also invest in my hedge fund.</p>
<p>Because there, we haven&rsquo;t sold a share of Snowflake.</p>
<p>But that is a different liquidity profile and a different deal.</p>
<p>But what I was getting to, Bill, and let&rsquo;s put work on the side, just in general, when</p>
<p>the opportunities for a firm to do a secondary arises, what&rsquo;s the right thing to do?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s rare.</p>
<p>I mean, for an angel, I think it&rsquo;s very different.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s rare for a venture firm to meet a secondary that has the firepower to absorb</p>
<p>the type.</p>
<p>That was Masa.</p>
<p>I mean, that was a very unique situation.</p>
<p>We typically distribute over three to six quarters following the lockup release, unless</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some exception.</p>
<p>Just systematically?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Dollar cost average, basically.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There have been a few exceptions.</p>
<p>We took Open Table Republican in 2009 knowingly at a low valuation.</p>
<p>And I held that until we sold it to booking.</p>
<p>Because I felt the network effect was there, and it was going to keep compounding and that</p>
<p>kind of thing.</p>
<p>And look, clearly, what Bezos has done or Zuckerberg, if you think you&rsquo;re sitting on</p>
<p>one of those, and you have to ask yourself- Well, those are two.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I know.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Maybe the Collison brothers are another one.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s going to play out the way those did, you&rsquo;re going to want to hold it.</p>
<p>Google it.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re very rare.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Google.</p>
<p>Have you and your partners watched both We Crashed and the dropout?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t speak for all of them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve watched both of them.</p>
<p>You watched both of them.</p>
<p>Which one was more accurate?</p>
<p>I think that&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know about accurate, because I only&hellip;</p>
<p>Super Pump was not accurate, just because they made up a lot of scenes.</p>
<p>Drummond wasn&rsquo;t very active at all, but he&rsquo;s in a lot of the scenes.</p>
<p>So a lot of them were made up.</p>
<p>I think Leto did a better job of showing you who Adam Neumann is, and really got into the</p>
<p>character.</p>
<p>He was incredible as Adam.</p>
<p>He was so good as an actor.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And accurate.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>To your having met.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And equally, on the other side, I think that Travis, and you know him well, is way more</p>
<p>nuanced.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the grittiest, hardest-working founders I&rsquo;ve ever worked with.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s super intelligent.</p>
<p>He can be really charming.</p>
<p>And those dimensions weren&rsquo;t explored in the characters, which I think is unfortunate.</p>
<p>I remember you telling me, this was, I don&rsquo;t know, in the height of WeWork, you said, Chamath,</p>
<p>this is the single greatest salesman I&rsquo;ve ever met in my life.</p>
<p>You told me also, the first time Adam Neumann came in, you and your partners, he left the</p>
<p>room, and you guys looked at each other, and you guys were like, we just have to invest</p>
<p>in this guy.</p>
<p>Because he can just&hellip;</p>
<p>I said, we should never invest in real estate, and we have to do this deal.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s ask Brad a question.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>Well, I watched the first&hellip;</p>
<p>Jay and I were watching We Crash.</p>
<p>I watched the first two episodes, and the only thing I could think of, Bill, was, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Adam Neumann&rsquo;s next company, and where do I send the check?</p>
<p>Because&hellip;</p>
<p>I think he already&hellip;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got something brewing.</p>
<p>I have a question for Brad.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>I wanted to go back to&hellip;</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve been up here for, like, eight hours today, Jake.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much more you want me to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m exhausted after an hour of these things.</p>
<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t know how you do it.</p>
<p>Have a round of applause.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been interviewing people for, like, 10 hours.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, like, done after an hour and a half.</p>
<p>Anyway, Brad, so, let&rsquo;s go back to the 100 times ARR.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a lot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not mad at you, but that was a lot.</p>
<p>It was a lot.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve been interviewing people for, like, 10 hours, I&rsquo;m, like, done after an hour</p>
<p>and a half.</p>
<p>Anyway, Brad, so, let&rsquo;s go back to the 100 times ARR multiples that people are paying</p>
<p>last year.</p>
<p>Because these investors, you know, with the benefit of 20-20 hindsight, they may look</p>
<p>kind of sheepish, but we know these investors and the pace car setting the valuations for</p>
<p>the whole industry, you know, is these big, giant hedge funds.</p>
<p>We all know what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re super sophisticated people.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, they&rsquo;re been very successful investors for a long period of time.</p>
<p>You know, what&rsquo;s the, the word used when we talked about it privately was gaslight, gaslighted.</p>
<p>That, you know, the market was sort of gaslighting all of us into thinking that the public comps</p>
<p>for these companies was, were much higher than they were.</p>
<p>Is that why, is that behind the psychology of why these very sophisticated investors</p>
<p>made these big mistakes?</p>
<p>Or how do you explain that?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I think there&rsquo;s a massive amount of research that&rsquo;s been done that Buffett</p>
<p>and Marx and many others have quoted, that your ability to calculate risk goes down when</p>
<p>you see a bunch of other people doing that thing, right?</p>
<p>Because your body, your mind&rsquo;s telling you, well, I won&rsquo;t die because I&rsquo;m just doing what</p>
<p>those other 100 people are.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s herd mentality.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the lemming effect, confirmation bias.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not that, I mean, you know, you didn&rsquo;t name them, but Tiger, right?</p>
<p>We know them, they&rsquo;re great investors, et cetera.</p>
<p>But you had to understand they were playing a different game, right?</p>
<p>And so when people who were building portfolios of 20 names were trying to play the same game</p>
<p>as a firm building a portfolio of 400 names, right?</p>
<p>It was like trying to follow, you know, SoftBank in 2017.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not, I mean, listen, we all thought Masa, SoftBank was going to be a wipeout in</p>
<p>Vision One.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t, right?</p>
<p>Now I know he just had a huge recent mark.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see where it ultimately settles out.</p>
<p>So I mean, I think from my perspective, you know, like Bill said, you get forced onto</p>
<p>the field.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain amount you have to do to stay in the game, to have the conversation.</p>
<p>But listen, as far back as, you know, last April, we were sitting around the table on</p>
<p>Thursday at your place saying, this can&rsquo;t continue, right?</p>
<p>And then in the fall, it was Bezos is selling, Musk is selling, like all the signals were</p>
<p>going off, right?</p>
<p>And so I think you have to know the game that you&rsquo;re playing.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a seed investor, an early stage investor, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what everybody</p>
<p>else is doing.</p>
<p>You have an obligation to play a differentiated game.</p>
<p>And what I would say today is, if somebody calls me up tomorrow and says, hey, Tiger&rsquo;s</p>
<p>doing this deal at 75 times ARR, do you want to do it?</p>
<p>They would have to pry the dollar out of my fucking hand with a crowbar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not risking my money or my partner&rsquo;s money doing something that we&rsquo;re not underwriting,</p>
<p>you know, to&hellip;</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m willing to underwrite, David, to that five-year average.</p>
<p>I think what you have in the market now is a huge opportunity because people are in a</p>
<p>fetal position under their desks, scared that the world has forever changed because the</p>
<p>CEOs of big banks go on CNBC and start hyperventilating about deglobalization and hyperinflation and</p>
<p>all this stuff.</p>
<p>And not one of them has actually built a model and, you know, deconstructed the components</p>
<p>of CPI.</p>
<p>I think the much more likely explanation is that the trends that existed for 20 years</p>
<p>still exist.</p>
<p>They were interrupted temporarily by us saving ourselves from a catastrophe with COVID.</p>
<p>The transient thing that everybody has come to make fun of, right?</p>
<p>Transient can be a year, two years, three years.</p>
<p>We will look back at this graph and that inflation will roll over and I suspect that those trends</p>
<p>will continue.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m willing to underwrite to that.</p>
<p>But if you told me you thought inflation was going to be 5% for the next decade and the</p>
<p>10-year was going to 7%, I would say short every tech company in the market.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Short everything.</p>
<p>Short everything in the market and don&rsquo;t invest a dollar in venture until you have line of</p>
<p>sight and the market has repriced it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the market is wrestling with right now.</p>
<p>We have some people who are saying, you know, markets abhor uncertainty.</p>
<p>And you have peak uncertainty.</p>
<p>We have a war.</p>
<p>We have&hellip;</p>
<p>This is the hardest forecasting job of my career.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll shut up.</p>
<p>You have filibustering.</p>
<p>But, you know, like that is, you know, I think that is ultimately the question.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a founder or you&rsquo;re an investor, what are you willing to underwrite to?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And Bill, what are your thoughts in terms of early stage and serious A?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s exactly what I was thinking.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>He said, don&rsquo;t take it that way.</p>
<p>We love to invest in two people in a PowerPoint.</p>
<p>Like if that investment can happen today and all, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if the inflation pops</p>
<p>or interest rates go up.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t affect them.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t even matter if there&rsquo;s a war.</p>
<p>It might help.</p>
<p>It might help actually.</p>
<p>Yes, because you&rsquo;re hiring people at half price.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s less competition.</p>
<p>I mean, my biggest problem of the past six years was hyper competition.</p>
<p>Finding a CFO.</p>
<p>No, not just talent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about like, I&rsquo;m talking about Uber and Lyft and like hundreds of billions</p>
<p>of dollars of money raised in the private market and shot onto the playing field out</p>
<p>of a cannon.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brutal.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not happening if inflation&rsquo;s going up.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t allow the market to really sort out the winners and losers properly because</p>
<p>the companies that should contract get propped up for a little bit longer.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some talented people in those companies that don&rsquo;t then end up in the right home.</p>
<p>You know, I said this last week, the most transformational moment in our company&rsquo;s history,</p>
<p>at Facebook&rsquo;s history, was during the GFC because of the fact that there weren&rsquo;t any</p>
<p>other alternatives to go and work.</p>
<p>By the way, I found, and I shared this with my partners the other day, I found through</p>
<p>my career, which wasn&rsquo;t four decades, but okay, that the window after the correction</p>
<p>is the calmest, where there&rsquo;s least anxiety for me at least, like everything slows down.</p>
<p>People talk rationally.</p>
<p>People aren&rsquo;t doing silly things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a walk on the beach.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more communication that seems rational and pragmatic.</p>
<p>And you can also maybe get to know a founder, understand the business over three, four,</p>
<p>five weeks and make a decision as opposed to three, four, five hours and they tell you,</p>
<p>hey, term sheets.</p>
<p>Well, and people think more unit, like think about unit economics in a more reasonable</p>
<p>way and you&rsquo;re not, you know.</p>
<p>This is why, I mean, the two of you invested in Uber.</p>
<p>I know because we&rsquo;ve had this conversation, Bill&rsquo;s too humble.</p>
<p>Well, he mentions it pretty frequently.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re too humble to take credit.</p>
<p>I did get it for $25 million.</p>
<p>But you know, Bill&rsquo;s talked about, you know, benchmarks legendary for investing in eBay</p>
<p>and it was winner take all.</p>
<p>All.</p>
<p>Winner take all.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I suspect that when you invested in Uber, you saw similar network effects.</p>
<p>You said, oh my God, an even bigger market.</p>
<p>This is going to be winner take all.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, what you didn&rsquo;t plan on was MASA raiding Saudi Arabia, getting $100 billion</p>
<p>of free money and then blowing it out of a can and into the market so Lyft and everybody</p>
<p>else could do diseconomic things.</p>
<p>And literally for.</p>
<p>I did not foresee that.</p>
<p>For seven years.</p>
<p>A confetti cannon is not predicted.</p>
<p>So the entire profit margin of Uber was competed away by stupidity.</p>
<p>When you tweeted last week, and I noticed it because Jason and I may have a little something</p>
<p>on the line here, you know, with respect to Uber, for the first time you tweeted after</p>
<p>their quarterly earnings, maybe we&rsquo;re starting to see network effects show up at Uber.</p>
<p>Because if you listen to the Lyft call, it was a train wreck.</p>
<p>For a decade.</p>
<p>What, what that money did was it made those businesses what we call the consumer surplus</p>
<p>movement.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Meaning what is a consumer surplus business?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when all you win.</p>
<p>Nobody else wins.</p>
<p>The employees don&rsquo;t win.</p>
<p>The shareholders don&rsquo;t win.</p>
<p>The investors don&rsquo;t win.</p>
<p>Consumers win.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting subsidized rides.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting subsidized food delivery.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting some subsidized form of content.</p>
<p>And there are these consumer surplus businesses that abound right now.</p>
<p>That still exist.</p>
<p>Which are propped up by dollars that aren&rsquo;t being, that they&rsquo;re not being allocated because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re competitive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just because they had to.</p>
<p>Negative, negative unit economics to drive growth.</p>
<p>I mean, Lyft said on their call that they were going to continue subsidizing.</p>
<p>In fact, they&rsquo;re going to increase their coupons.</p>
<p>I have a question for you guys.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Sorry, Bill.</p>
<p>I just want to ask you.</p>
<p>The negative unit economics to drive growth trend was a big one for the last eight years.</p>
<p>And it certainly seemed to have played out at Uber, but a lot of other delivery companies.</p>
<p>Do you think that as a strategy, assuming capital availability, negative unit economics</p>
<p>to drive growth.</p>
<p>And once you have the network, and once you&rsquo;ve grabbed the market, you make money, is a reasonable</p>
<p>strategy?</p>
<p>It all depends on whether you can rein it back in or not.</p>
<p>And I think DoorDash did an incredible job.</p>
<p>I think Jeff Bezos did an incredible job back in 01.</p>
<p>I think if 50 entrepreneurs try that trick, 49 are going to auger in.</p>
<p>By the way, that&rsquo;s the best, I think that&rsquo;s such a key takeaway.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s another part about it.</p>
<p>You can only pull it off as well as if in that moment, you have an effective monopoly,</p>
<p>which Bezos effectively did.</p>
<p>And Tony did in those markets where he was operating.</p>
<p>Nobody else was competing in Palo Alto, California.</p>
<p>And you know.</p>
<p>Well, they weren&rsquo;t competing the way he was, they weren&rsquo;t, for sure.</p>
<p>I have a question for the two of you guys.</p>
<p>What do you guys think about something like Instacart in a moment like this?</p>
<p>So 40 odd billion dollar valuation, maybe gets reset to 24.</p>
<p>They file to go public?</p>
<p>They file to go public confidentially.</p>
<p>Are you guys investors?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So candidly, what&rsquo;s going on here?</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s a provocative question because you have a business that&rsquo;s raised</p>
<p>a ton of capital that was born of the air that we&rsquo;re talking about that probably did</p>
<p>things that were- Unnatural.</p>
<p>If they weren&rsquo;t negative unit economics, they were close.</p>
<p>And they talked about it because they would say publicly, we&rsquo;re going to roll in advertising</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s going to bring us-</p>
<p>I got in trouble once.</p>
<p>This is on Bloomberg, so I think you can find this clip.</p>
<p>But I was talking to Emily Chang and she said something to the effect of, did you just see</p>
<p>this latest Sequoia round?</p>
<p>And I made this joke.</p>
<p>It was a complete joke.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>I was like, yeah.</p>
<p>I went to Instacart, I bought one mango, had it delivered for free, then I bought a second</p>
<p>mango.</p>
<p>I sent an email to Doug Leone, thanks for the second mango.</p>
<p>What a douche.</p>
<p>I bought four grapes and I said, consumer surplus.</p>
<p>I mean, you can get four grapes whenever you want.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to judge a company from the outside because you can&rsquo;t look at the financials.</p>
<p>But the product experience has evolved over a very long period of time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually pretty good.</p>
<p>I suspect there&rsquo;s an asset value there and whether that can match up with what someone</p>
<p>can afford to pay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>We got it.</p>
<p>We got to wrap.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Bill, just final question here.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>Why do you get to ask the final question?</p>
<p>We want to know where the markets are going.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about being sincere.</p>
<p>Ask the folks where the markets are going.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Brad, where&rsquo;s the market going to be at this time next year?</p>
<p>Answer that question.</p>
<p>We will be higher for growth stocks this time next year, but we may very well get there</p>
<p>by way of lower and potentially meaningfully lower because the counterfactual to the hyperinflation</p>
<p>argument is you can&rsquo;t deliver the counterfactual for at least four to five months.</p>
<p>The facts don&rsquo;t exist until we actually see the facts play out.</p>
<p>But my suspicion is we return to trend, things become more predictable and investable again,</p>
<p>and we bounce back up to the five-year average.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Back now for you, Bill.</p>
<p>Final question.</p>
<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t get that one?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Too easy.</p>
<p>You can answer it if you like, but I got a more important one.</p>
<p>6.385% higher.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re not going to answer it, so I got a better one for you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not in the next benchmark fund.</p>
<p>Essentially, that means retirement of the spurs.</p>
<p>Now the market&rsquo;s down.</p>
<p>You seem like you&rsquo;re a little bit bored.</p>
<p>Are you going to get back into early stage investing, yes or no?</p>
<p>And are you missing it?</p>
<p>I think&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that was.</p>
<p>I think I might get intrigued with doing angel stuff the way Bezos did.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I want to practice the art taking board seats.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still on 10 that I&rsquo;m serving dutifully, and I&rsquo;ve played that game.</p>
<p>Maybe similar to what David said about operating a business.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve played that game.</p>
<p>You meet a great founder.</p>
<p>They got a good idea.</p>
<p>You vibe.</p>
<p>You put in a 500K check.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be open to that.</p>
<p>Do you want to tell&hellip;</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m very excited about public stocks here, actually.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re excited about what?</p>
<p>Public stocks.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The valuations are getting super interesting.</p>
<p>Crazy.</p>
<p>Such good deals out there.</p>
<p>Super interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You want to do your Bill Gurley imitation?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>You guys got to hear this.</p>
<p>At the poker table.</p>
<p>J-Cal.</p>
<p>J-Cal.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>Do I have to stay out here for this?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been investing for the better part of three or four decades, closer to four, and</p>
<p>ten boards I dutily served on, and every time I shrug it all in with Kings, Chamath</p>
<p>sucks out on me with a 9-10 suited, and that&rsquo;s just my luck right now, so maybe I&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>look at the public market cards.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just be liquid.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be liquid.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, BG Squared.</p>
<p>BG Squared, baby.</p>
<p>BG Squared, baby.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rainman David Saks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>We open sourced it to the fans, and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you, Wesley.</p>
<p>The queen of quinoa.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>Is your dog taking a notice in your driveway, Saks?</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy, because they&rsquo;re all just</p>
<p>useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like sexual tension, but we just need to release it somehow.</p>
<p>Let the beat.</p>
<p>Let your beat.</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
