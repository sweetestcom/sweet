    <p>my name is Bailey Syrian and today is Monday</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s murder mystery and makeup Monday</p>
<p>theme song still going strong I guess</p>
<p>how is it going</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;re having a great day so far</p>
<p>as good as it can be right now</p>
<p>you know this week</p>
<p>I have a very interesting story</p>
<p>coming live from the UK today</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to be talking about John Christie</p>
<p>have you heard of him</p>
<p>let me tell you this guy was all sorts of messed up</p>
<p>John Christie was born in Halifax</p>
<p>Yorkshire on April 8 1898</p>
<p>he was the 5th of 7 kids</p>
<p>john&rsquo;s parents</p>
<p>his father worked as a carpenter designer</p>
<p>and his mother was an amateur actress</p>
<p>John was said to have a pretty</p>
<p>rough relationship with his father</p>
<p>who ran a strict household</p>
<p>and showed little to no love towards his kids</p>
<p>I do feel like</p>
<p>that is just the common theme with adults back then</p>
<p>but John would say that his older siblings</p>
<p>would pick on or just bully him daily</p>
<p>there really was no escape from it</p>
<p>because also</p>
<p>he would go to school</p>
<p>and he was just a bit of a loner</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t have any friends</p>
<p>he would come home and feel like a loner</p>
<p>and just get picked on his mother</p>
<p>not much was really said about her</p>
<p>other than she was an amateur actress</p>
<p>and I was like okay</p>
<p>but what was said about her</p>
<p>was that she was just very overprotective of her kids</p>
<p>and she tend to baby them a little too much</p>
<p>you know what I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>jon&rsquo;s father kept himself busy by just working a lot</p>
<p>and then also</p>
<p>he ran an organization</p>
<p>or he was like</p>
<p>a leader in an organization called the Primrose League</p>
<p>primrose League</p>
<p>was an organization</p>
<p>for spreading conservative principles in Great Britain</p>
<p>and some of its goals were to uphold and support God</p>
<p>the Queen and the country</p>
<p>and also promoted purity among the working classes</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>2 little snippets</p>
<p>but john&rsquo;s father was involved with that organization</p>
<p>and it took up a lot of his time</p>
<p>at the age of 8</p>
<p>John went with his family to his grandfather&rsquo;s funeral</p>
<p>and John would later say that this had a profound</p>
<p>effect on him</p>
<p>it was his first real experience with death</p>
<p>and when he went to the funeral</p>
<p>it was an open casket</p>
<p>which will fuck anyone up</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m laughing</p>
<p>but like that shit is real</p>
<p>anyways so seeing his grandfather&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>laying in the open casket</p>
<p>it just made him a little bit more curious about death</p>
<p>and like what happens after</p>
<p>and the fact that his grandfather&rsquo;s body is just a body</p>
<p>like it just had him really thinking</p>
<p>how does noggin going</p>
<p>and John would say that he remembered</p>
<p>every little detail about how his grandfather looked</p>
<p>and it was just one of those moments in</p>
<p>life that he never forgot</p>
<p>time stamp on that moment in his life</p>
<p>John was pretty unpopular in school</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t have many friends</p>
<p>and after school</p>
<p>a lot of kids</p>
<p>you know they would go and play together</p>
<p>play some sports</p>
<p>hang out at a local playground</p>
<p>but John said that he liked roaming around</p>
<p>the cemeteries</p>
<p>nearby instead</p>
<p>he just kind of sounds like a little like a goth kid</p>
<p>you know they hang out in the cemetery</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s stereotyping</p>
<p>Bailey okay</p>
<p>so at the age of 15</p>
<p>John left school to go work full time</p>
<p>so he got a job working as a movie projectionist</p>
<p>one night he had met a girl at his place of work</p>
<p>and she was a little bit older than him</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>they were hanging out</p>
<p>and she invited John to hang out with her</p>
<p>hang out you know</p>
<p>just hang out</p>
<p>so this lady friend told John</p>
<p>that he could have his way with her</p>
<p>but it was said that John failed to perform</p>
<p>she went around</p>
<p>and told friends that John over here</p>
<p>he couldn&rsquo;t perform</p>
<p>and then all the other kids gave him the nickname</p>
<p>quote Reggie No Dick</p>
<p>and they would make fun of him whenever they saw him</p>
<p>Reggie was his middle name</p>
<p>so there was a period of time where he went by Reggie</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how they got Reggie</p>
<p>No Dick from his middle name</p>
<p>anyway they were making fun of him calling him Reggie</p>
<p>No Dick and obviously this is upsetting to him</p>
<p>he already didn&rsquo;t have many friends</p>
<p>and now he&rsquo;s Reggie No Dick</p>
<p>how is this gonna end</p>
<p>I wonder how it&rsquo;s gonna end</p>
<p>at the age of 17</p>
<p>John was caught stealing from his work</p>
<p>and he got fired</p>
<p>so once he got fired</p>
<p>and his parents found out</p>
<p>they kicked him out of the house</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really sure where he went</p>
<p>when he was kicked out of the house</p>
<p>but it was like</p>
<p>shortly after</p>
<p>when he turned 18</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when he was called up to serve in the army</p>
<p>and he was sent to France</p>
<p>in the height of World War I</p>
<p>So John would be there for about a year</p>
<p>and then in 1919 wild times</p>
<p>John was left with eye and throat injuries</p>
<p>from a mustard attack</p>
<p>and he left the army with a small disability pension</p>
<p>and then he would move back to Halifax</p>
<p>where he took a job working at the local post office</p>
<p>so while working at the local post office</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when he began dating a woman named Ethel</p>
<p>and him and Ethel knew each other</p>
<p>because they actually kind of grew up around each other</p>
<p>like they knew of each other you know</p>
<p>and then when they got older</p>
<p>they remade</p>
<p>fell in Love</p>
<p>and then they ended up getting married</p>
<p>they got married in May of 1920</p>
<p>and they were both 22 years old</p>
<p>but of course well</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry no</p>
<p>not of course</p>
<p>unfortunately</p>
<p>the joyful marriage didn&rsquo;t last long</p>
<p>when does a joyful marriage last long am I right</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kidding</p>
<p>you see what had happened was</p>
<p>John was caught stealing mail from his work</p>
<p>and he was sent jail</p>
<p>and this would be the first of several visits to jail</p>
<p>for petty crimes</p>
<p>so John goes to jail</p>
<p>for a little bit of time</p>
<p>and then when he gets out</p>
<p>his wife Ethel would leave for the weekend</p>
<p>and like visit her family</p>
<p>while John was at home</p>
<p>so one weekend</p>
<p>she goes away to visit her family</p>
<p>and while Ethel is away</p>
<p>John sure does play</p>
<p>John fancied the local sex workers</p>
<p>and when Ethel was away</p>
<p>he would go out at night</p>
<p>and find local sex workers</p>
<p>to bring back to his place</p>
<p>for some sweet loving</p>
<p>he was doing this</p>
<p>from time to time</p>
<p>John brings back</p>
<p>you know a sex worker to his home</p>
<p>and Ethel surprise surprise</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s home you know</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s home early</p>
<p>and she walks in</p>
<p>and she sees that he&rsquo;s with a girl</p>
<p>another woman</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s upset</p>
<p>for good reason</p>
<p>must I explain more no</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s when they decided</p>
<p>that it would be best if the couple separated</p>
<p>so they did</p>
<p>so John moves to London</p>
<p>and while living there</p>
<p>he would be jailed</p>
<p>3 more times</p>
<p>it was mainly theft</p>
<p>and then the last one was</p>
<p>he was attacking a woman</p>
<p>I believe it</p>
<p>was a sex worker</p>
<p>9 years go by</p>
<p>John once again</p>
<p>is sitting in jail</p>
<p>in an I guess</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just feeling lonely</p>
<p>or something</p>
<p>but he decides</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna write</p>
<p>Ethel a letter</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna write her a letter</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s going to ask for forgiveness</p>
<p>and for her to take him back</p>
<p>once he gets out</p>
<p>Ethel receives the letter</p>
<p>and she just decides that</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>she wants to be with him</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what she wants</p>
<p>so she at that time</p>
<p>was working as a typist</p>
<p>and she decides to just give up her job</p>
<p>and move from</p>
<p>Yorkshire to</p>
<p>the then CD</p>
<p>West London area</p>
<p>of Notting Hill side</p>
<p>note but isn&rsquo;t Notting Hill</p>
<p>considered iconic</p>
<p>and upscale</p>
<p>now yeah well</p>
<p>during this time</p>
<p>it was full of rats</p>
<p>nobody wanted to live there</p>
<p>every article</p>
<p>I kept reading</p>
<p>kept referring to it</p>
<p>as seedy and dirty</p>
<p>so in 1938 the couple</p>
<p>they moved to the ground</p>
<p>floor of 10</p>
<p>Rillington Place</p>
<p>which was one of</p>
<p>3 different apartments</p>
<p>and a rundown house</p>
<p>it was converted</p>
<p>into apartments</p>
<p>but they had a tiny garden</p>
<p>and they also all had to</p>
<p>share a bathroom</p>
<p>not ideal in 1939</p>
<p>John would be back in uniform</p>
<p>to serve in</p>
<p>World War II</p>
<p>as a Special Constable</p>
<p>in the War Reserve Police</p>
<p>so pretty much</p>
<p>this gave John</p>
<p>full powers</p>
<p>like a police officer</p>
<p>or of a police officer</p>
<p>oh dear this can&rsquo;t be good</p>
<p>at this time</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t do like</p>
<p>any type of</p>
<p>background check</p>
<p>on John to pull up</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>previous convictions</p>
<p>or something</p>
<p>maybe that could have like</p>
<p>helped a little bit</p>
<p>and not give him that title</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>but okay well</p>
<p>John would say</p>
<p>you know that</p>
<p>this uniform</p>
<p>just made him feel</p>
<p>very powerful</p>
<p>which is just not good</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just not good</p>
<p>so in 1943 couples</p>
<p>still together</p>
<p>living in their apartment</p>
<p>their flat Ethel</p>
<p>decided that</p>
<p>she was gonna go away</p>
<p>to visit her family</p>
<p>for the weekend</p>
<p>John was feeling a little</p>
<p>a little lonely</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s home alone</p>
<p>and he just wants some company</p>
<p>for the night</p>
<p>he puts on his uniform</p>
<p>and he goes looking</p>
<p>for someone</p>
<p>to hold him tight</p>
<p>well no he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lie</p>
<p>so he wears his uniform</p>
<p>and he goes down</p>
<p>to where the</p>
<p>local sex workers are at</p>
<p>and he picks up</p>
<p>a 17 year old girl</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s working</p>
<p>as a sex worker</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>which is like</p>
<p>what poor thing</p>
<p>probably didn&rsquo;t even want</p>
<p>to be there</p>
<p>but he picks up a 17 year</p>
<p>old sex worker</p>
<p>and he brings her</p>
<p>back to his place</p>
<p>he tries to be</p>
<p>a good hostess</p>
<p>offers them</p>
<p>or her I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>something to like</p>
<p>drink you know</p>
<p>whatever you</p>
<p>wanna hang out</p>
<p>have a seat</p>
<p>she might humble abode</p>
<p>when she wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really looking</p>
<p>John takes a rope</p>
<p>and he strangles her</p>
<p>strangles her</p>
<p>to death once</p>
<p>he knew that she was</p>
<p>indeed dead</p>
<p>he first tried to</p>
<p>hide the body</p>
<p>beneath the</p>
<p>floorboards</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s trying</p>
<p>to lift up the</p>
<p>floor boards</p>
<p>and get that body down there</p>
<p>but then he realizes like oh</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t gonna work</p>
<p>what do I do</p>
<p>so John instead</p>
<p>waits until</p>
<p>everybody in his</p>
<p>housing unit</p>
<p>he waits until everyone</p>
<p>goes to sleep</p>
<p>because what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen</p>
<p>is he&rsquo;s gonna drag</p>
<p>the body outside</p>
<p>but everyone&rsquo;s windows</p>
<p>are facing this</p>
<p>little garden area</p>
<p>that they share</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s waiting</p>
<p>until everyone</p>
<p>goes to bed</p>
<p>lights out he drags</p>
<p>the victim&rsquo;s</p>
<p>body outside</p>
<p>and he first is</p>
<p>like trying to</p>
<p>hide the body</p>
<p>behind some bushes</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like trying</p>
<p>to put some</p>
<p>leaves on it</p>
<p>or something</p>
<p>no one will know</p>
<p>and while he hides the body</p>
<p>he then goes</p>
<p>and he digs a grave</p>
<p>in the front</p>
<p>of the garden</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s digging</p>
<p>the body&rsquo;s out</p>
<p>there too John</p>
<p>why didn&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>move the body</p>
<p>after the fact</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s doing it</p>
<p>and nobody&rsquo;s noticing</p>
<p>so he digs his</p>
<p>grave and then</p>
<p>John is able to</p>
<p>bury the body</p>
<p>cover it up</p>
<p>make it look like</p>
<p>nothing happened</p>
<p>and sadly it</p>
<p>stayed there</p>
<p>undisturbed</p>
<p>for a decade</p>
<p>so soon after that</p>
<p>John goes and finds</p>
<p>work as a clerk</p>
<p>in a factory</p>
<p>so while working there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when he met</p>
<p>another woman</p>
<p>who he found</p>
<p>very attractive</p>
<p>31 years old</p>
<p>he was enjoying</p>
<p>what he was looking at</p>
<p>John was very</p>
<p>friendly with her</p>
<p>and they seemed to</p>
<p>really hit it off</p>
<p>so one night</p>
<p>John asked if</p>
<p>she wants to come back</p>
<p>to his place</p>
<p>because once</p>
<p>again bethel</p>
<p>was leaving</p>
<p>for the evening</p>
<p>and he was like hey</p>
<p>you should come over</p>
<p>to my place</p>
<p>the woman agrees</p>
<p>and she indeed</p>
<p>goes over to</p>
<p>john&rsquo;s place</p>
<p>once she&rsquo;s inside</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like hey</p>
<p>come sit on this</p>
<p>reclining chair</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s comfortable</p>
<p>make yourself at home</p>
<p>let me get you</p>
<p>something to drink</p>
<p>while she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sitting there</p>
<p>she was tricked</p>
<p>into inhaling</p>
<p>coal gas fumes</p>
<p>honestly I really</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t figure out</p>
<p>how she was</p>
<p>tricked or how he</p>
<p>would trick her</p>
<p>into inhaling</p>
<p>cold gas fumes</p>
<p>but she became</p>
<p>unconscious</p>
<p>while she&rsquo;s passed out</p>
<p>John unfortunately</p>
<p>sadly disturbingly</p>
<p>rapes her sexually</p>
<p>violates her</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>grabs a stalking</p>
<p>and strangles her</p>
<p>in john&rsquo;s confession</p>
<p>later on he said quote</p>
<p>I gazed down</p>
<p>at her body</p>
<p>and felt a quite</p>
<p>peaceful thrill</p>
<p>I had no regrets</p>
<p>John then buries</p>
<p>this victim</p>
<p>alongside his</p>
<p>first victim</p>
<p>in the front garden</p>
<p>as well in 1948</p>
<p>a truck driver</p>
<p>named Timothy Evans</p>
<p>his wife Beryl</p>
<p>and their baby</p>
<p>Geraldine moved</p>
<p>into a flat</p>
<p>above john&rsquo;s place</p>
<p>it was said</p>
<p>that the family became</p>
<p>quite friendly</p>
<p>with John and</p>
<p>Ethel but would</p>
<p>kind of just</p>
<p>talk with John</p>
<p>a little bit more</p>
<p>and at some point</p>
<p>it was said</p>
<p>that Beryl had</p>
<p>found herself</p>
<p>pregnant again</p>
<p>she had expressed to John</p>
<p>how the family</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t afford</p>
<p>to have another baby</p>
<p>at that time</p>
<p>and how she didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want the baby</p>
<p>John was able</p>
<p>to convince</p>
<p>Beryl that he</p>
<p>could perform</p>
<p>or carry out</p>
<p>an abortion</p>
<p>and she agreed</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>said that he did</p>
<p>so sadly though</p>
<p>that same day</p>
<p>Barrel died</p>
<p>although it is</p>
<p>unclear exactly</p>
<p>how she died</p>
<p>many believe</p>
<p>that she died</p>
<p>because of John</p>
<p>performing an abortion</p>
<p>on her and like</p>
<p>something just went</p>
<p>horribly wrong</p>
<p>some disagree</p>
<p>and say that</p>
<p>John intentionally killed her</p>
<p>some believe that</p>
<p>John didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>actually perform</p>
<p>an abortion</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unclear</p>
<p>but poor Beryl</p>
<p>passed away</p>
<p>so beryl&rsquo;s husband</p>
<p>Timothy he goes</p>
<p>down to the</p>
<p>police station</p>
<p>and tells the police</p>
<p>that he himself</p>
<p>Timothy had</p>
<p>killed his wife</p>
<p>and stuffed</p>
<p>her body parts</p>
<p>down the drain</p>
<p>yeah so for</p>
<p>good reason</p>
<p>police go down</p>
<p>to the house</p>
<p>they were unable to find</p>
<p>barrel&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>and they also</p>
<p>failed to uncover</p>
<p>the body said</p>
<p>John had buried</p>
<p>in the garden</p>
<p>but after several</p>
<p>visits out to the</p>
<p>house police</p>
<p>they were able to find</p>
<p>they eventually</p>
<p>found barrel&rsquo;s</p>
<p>body stashed</p>
<p>in the bathroom</p>
<p>and next to her</p>
<p>was their 14</p>
<p>month old baby</p>
<p>who was also</p>
<p>deceased so</p>
<p>police come</p>
<p>back to Timothy</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>who is in jail</p>
<p>actually I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s in jail</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like hey we</p>
<p>found Barrel</p>
<p>and she was</p>
<p>in the bathroom</p>
<p>we found her body there</p>
<p>we also found</p>
<p>your baby there</p>
<p>with her as well</p>
<p>and it was said</p>
<p>that Timothy</p>
<p>was just shocked</p>
<p>speechless and</p>
<p>then emotional</p>
<p>then after some</p>
<p>time for him</p>
<p>to process it all</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>timothy&rsquo;s story</p>
<p>dramatically changed</p>
<p>so then Timothy</p>
<p>was like okay</p>
<p>change of plans</p>
<p>it was actually</p>
<p>the neighbor John</p>
<p>who was the one</p>
<p>that killed him</p>
<p>Timothy goes on</p>
<p>to say that</p>
<p>John told him</p>
<p>that the abortion</p>
<p>had gone wrong</p>
<p>and that their</p>
<p>baby was going</p>
<p>to be adopted</p>
<p>since Timothy</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be able</p>
<p>to take care</p>
<p>of the baby</p>
<p>himself so Timothy</p>
<p>at this point</p>
<p>had no idea</p>
<p>that his 14</p>
<p>month old was dead</p>
<p>it was said</p>
<p>that Timothy</p>
<p>he had an extremely</p>
<p>low IQ and it</p>
<p>was believed</p>
<p>that John knew</p>
<p>this and took</p>
<p>advantage of him</p>
<p>at this point</p>
<p>Timothy wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>very reliable</p>
<p>because at first</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s full on</p>
<p>confessing right</p>
<p>so then he comes</p>
<p>around and says</p>
<p>actually no</p>
<p>it was John</p>
<p>but then they had</p>
<p>no evidence</p>
<p>that it was John</p>
<p>who indeed did it</p>
<p>so instead Timothy</p>
<p>he gets taken to</p>
<p>court has to go</p>
<p>through the</p>
<p>whole process</p>
<p>of court and</p>
<p>being convicted</p>
<p>all the stuff right</p>
<p>so Timothy gets</p>
<p>taken to court</p>
<p>and get this</p>
<p>get this Timothy</p>
<p>was convicted</p>
<p>and sentenced</p>
<p>for murder sadly</p>
<p>Timothy was hanged</p>
<p>on March 9th 1950</p>
<p>for a crime</p>
<p>that he didn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>well we&rsquo;re pretty sure</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>this poor man</p>
<p>died because of</p>
<p>John fuck John</p>
<p>was like woo</p>
<p>close call am I right</p>
<p>Ethel said that john&rsquo;s behavior was becoming more odd</p>
<p>he would be complaining about headaches</p>
<p>and he seemed to be suffering from memory loss amnesia</p>
<p>and he just seemed to be under a lot of stress</p>
<p>she just couldn&rsquo;t figure out why</p>
<p>but John pretty much just walked away</p>
<p>from that situation</p>
<p>John seemed to just never be happy with Ethel</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fighting a lot</p>
<p>disagreeing a lot</p>
<p>and Ethel just kind of seemed to be going more and more</p>
<p>like together</p>
<p>go see her family</p>
<p>to go visit them</p>
<p>she just didn&rsquo;t really want to be around John</p>
<p>on December 14th 1942</p>
<p>while Ethel was asleep</p>
<p>John strangled her</p>
<p>he strangled poor Ethel</p>
<p>and killed her once he knew that she was dead</p>
<p>he then buried her under the floorboards in their flat</p>
<p>the whole reason I personally get so invested</p>
<p>are curious about true crime</p>
<p>and not just serial killers and stuff</p>
<p>is because I&rsquo;d want to understand</p>
<p>or what I&rsquo;m always trying to understand</p>
<p>is what in the world goes through someone&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>that says like yes</p>
<p>the floorboards</p>
<p>lift em up lift em up</p>
<p>put the body there</p>
<p>like what what is that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m always trying to figure out</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever figure it out</p>
<p>but I just wanna know</p>
<p>how do you want</p>
<p>what the floorboard you lifted</p>
<p>you put that your wife</p>
<p>huh like what</p>
<p>I just wanna understand</p>
<p>but I won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>unless I become like a psychologist or something</p>
<p>anyways so he kills his wife</p>
<p>and he puts her under the floorboards</p>
<p>so people would ask John hey hey</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s Ethel</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s she up to</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen her in a while</p>
<p>and then John be like</p>
<p>oh yeah you know</p>
<p>she actually moved back north</p>
<p>to go live with her family</p>
<p>and that would be that</p>
<p>Ethel she would always write letters to her family</p>
<p>back at home</p>
<p>so John knew like</p>
<p>I need to keep these letters going</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re gonna suspect something right</p>
<p>so he ends up writing a letter to ethel&rsquo;s family</p>
<p>explaining that he would be the one writing the letters</p>
<p>from now on</p>
<p>because Ethel had arthritis</p>
<p>and she couldn&rsquo;t do it herself</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure they probably thought something</p>
<p>was a little odd</p>
<p>but for the time being</p>
<p>it just seemed to work</p>
<p>so John at this time</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have a job now</p>
<p>he needed some money</p>
<p>so what&rsquo;s he gonna do</p>
<p>he goes back to ethel&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>which is under the floorboard</p>
<p>and he takes off her wedding ring</p>
<p>and he ends up selling that</p>
<p>and he also sells his wife&rsquo;s watch</p>
<p>get some money</p>
<p>through that gross</p>
<p>that he did not</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re at right now</p>
<p>then he also forged her signature</p>
<p>to empty out her bank account</p>
<p>all of her savings everything</p>
<p>which wasn&rsquo;t a lot</p>
<p>but it was some money</p>
<p>John sold every piece of furniture that he had in his</p>
<p>pretty much</p>
<p>just was trying to</p>
<p>get any kind of money together that he possibly could</p>
<p>so John was really excited about this new freedom</p>
<p>he had he had a whole flat to himself</p>
<p>and some cash</p>
<p>and no wife</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s gonna be upset with him about anything</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just like hell</p>
<p>yeah baby Wu</p>
<p>John would go back to what he enjoyed most</p>
<p>which was to go out at night</p>
<p>and pick up local sex workers</p>
<p>bring them back to his place</p>
<p>then it went back to him</p>
<p>killing them</p>
<p>so he would go out</p>
<p>bring the sex workers</p>
<p>back to his house</p>
<p>he would then gas them</p>
<p>strangle them</p>
<p>have sexual relations with the victim&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>and then he would either</p>
<p>stuff their bodies in the floorboard</p>
<p>or in a little alcove in the kitchen</p>
<p>now John would do this to 3 more victims</p>
<p>in March 1953</p>
<p>John finally moved out of Rillington Place</p>
<p>and went on the run</p>
<p>living around West London mainly</p>
<p>he was sleeping on the streets</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t really have anywhere to go</p>
<p>so his old place</p>
<p>place is like</p>
<p>up for rent</p>
<p>and of course</p>
<p>you know someone new moves in</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t long until they noticed</p>
<p>a very intense</p>
<p>stench coming out of the walls or something</p>
<p>so the new tenant said that they you know</p>
<p>they thought</p>
<p>maybe it was like a dead rat under the floorboards</p>
<p>damn rats everywhere</p>
<p>so they start poking around</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re peeling back newly wallpapered walls</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s when they do</p>
<p>discovered what seemed to be a woman&rsquo;s leg</p>
<p>behind the wall in the kitchen alcove</p>
<p>yeah oh Jesus</p>
<p>oh dear a leg</p>
<p>welcome home</p>
<p>so police come out to the place</p>
<p>and they find everything</p>
<p>they find the bodies</p>
<p>that were stuffed in the floorboards</p>
<p>behind the walls</p>
<p>and in the yard</p>
<p>police also found a tin a tobacco tin</p>
<p>containing 4 sets of pubic hair</p>
<p>all neatly packed together</p>
<p>you know how a lot of serial killers</p>
<p>still have what&rsquo;s called a trophy or trophies</p>
<p>something that they keep</p>
<p>to kind of remind them of the murder</p>
<p>of their killing</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m thinking that&rsquo;s what this was</p>
<p>I mean I could only assume that&rsquo;s what it is</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what he was doing with that</p>
<p>but okay pubic hair</p>
<p>the police are able to look up</p>
<p>who lived at the place beforehand</p>
<p>and they pull up</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s John</p>
<p>so they put out an alert for the police officers</p>
<p>to keep a lookout for John Christie</p>
<p>okay we think he killed a bunch of people</p>
<p>so if you can keep an eye out</p>
<p>that&rsquo;d be great</p>
<p>unfortunately for John</p>
<p>he was found pretty quickly by a police officer</p>
<p>who was kind of walking around</p>
<p>patrolling the area</p>
<p>John was on the street</p>
<p>because he didn&rsquo;t have a house at the time</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just living on the street</p>
<p>and police officer saw him</p>
<p>recognize him</p>
<p>and place him under arrest</p>
<p>so John has taken in to be</p>
<p>interrogated</p>
<p>and John would refer to the murders as</p>
<p>those regrettable happenings end quote</p>
<p>and John also said that they were all accidental</p>
<p>that they were all</p>
<p>actually caused by the victims themselves</p>
<p>during their struggles</p>
<p>if they didn&rsquo;t struggle</p>
<p>they probably wouldn&rsquo;t be dead</p>
<p>so he denied having sexual relations</p>
<p>with any of the victims</p>
<p>now eventually</p>
<p>John would confess to at least one murder</p>
<p>but he pleaded not guilty</p>
<p>on the grounds of insanity</p>
<p>John started to give random little quotes</p>
<p>to justify his insanity plea</p>
<p>this is what it said</p>
<p>in his biography</p>
<p>but he was saying</p>
<p>for me a corpse has a beauty and dignity</p>
<p>which a living body</p>
<p>could never hold</p>
<p>and when it came to his wife&rsquo;s death</p>
<p>he said quote</p>
<p>I removed the one obstacle</p>
<p>that for 10 years had apparently held me in check</p>
<p>after she had gone</p>
<p>the way was clear</p>
<p>for me to fulfill my destiny end quote</p>
<p>I feel like he could have tried a little harder</p>
<p>with those quotes</p>
<p>John not the best ones but okay</p>
<p>it was saying that</p>
<p>he was kind of speaking more like this</p>
<p>more freely</p>
<p>I guess just to justify that</p>
<p>he was pleading</p>
<p>using the insanity plea</p>
<p>so john&rsquo;s trial began</p>
<p>on June 22 1953</p>
<p>it only took 3 days</p>
<p>for them to come up with the verdict</p>
<p>John was found guilty of 4 of the murders</p>
<p>dismissing the insanity plea</p>
<p>the judge described the case as a horrible one</p>
<p>John was sentenced to death</p>
<p>while John was waiting for his execution</p>
<p>there had been some talks about the Timothy Evans case</p>
<p>and whether there had been a miscarriage of justice</p>
<p>hmm I wonder</p>
<p>because government officials</p>
<p>refused to take responsibility for their heirs</p>
<p>they decided nah</p>
<p>Timothy deserve what he got</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s a bad person</p>
<p>many members of the Parliament</p>
<p>and the Howard League for Penal Reform</p>
<p>refused to accept this answer</p>
<p>and they wanted to question John more</p>
<p>about timothy&rsquo;s case</p>
<p>gather more information</p>
<p>maybe they can further</p>
<p>prove that John was the one that killed his</p>
<p>wife and child</p>
<p>and therefore</p>
<p>the justice system</p>
<p>had really failed Timothy</p>
<p>because John</p>
<p>at this point</p>
<p>hadn&rsquo;t confessed to that</p>
<p>he was still letting Timothy take the blame</p>
<p>but unfortunately</p>
<p>on July 15th 1953</p>
<p>John was hanged</p>
<p>pentonville Prison</p>
<p>so they like the people of the Parliament</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t further</p>
<p>ask questions</p>
<p>and hopes to get some answers</p>
<p>about timothy&rsquo;s case</p>
<p>after john&rsquo;s death</p>
<p>the public was</p>
<p>still pushing</p>
<p>to bring awareness</p>
<p>and keep the conversation going</p>
<p>of the possible miscarriage of justice</p>
<p>on timothy&rsquo;s case</p>
<p>and were doing this</p>
<p>up until 1966</p>
<p>Mr Justice Barbin</p>
<p>ruled quote</p>
<p>it is more probable than not</p>
<p>that Timothy killed Beryl</p>
<p>and it is more probable than not</p>
<p>that Timothy did not kill his baby</p>
<p>end quote so</p>
<p>okay this was not a good answer</p>
<p>for people still campaigning against this case</p>
<p>but it was enough to get Timothy a royal pardon</p>
<p>timothy&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>was exhumed from Pentonville Prison</p>
<p>where it had laid in an unmarked grave</p>
<p>close to john&rsquo;s</p>
<p>timothy&rsquo;s body was moved to a new location</p>
<p>I believe closer to his wife</p>
<p>where his wife was buried</p>
<p>john&rsquo;s old flat at Rillington Place</p>
<p>was flattened in 1978</p>
<p>a new residential area was built on top of the site</p>
<p>to cover up the burial ground there</p>
<p>also seemed to be</p>
<p>based off the pictures</p>
<p>I was looking at</p>
<p>seems to be like a little garden area</p>
<p>where actually the bodies were buried</p>
<p>there was no note or anything</p>
<p>no sign about what happened there</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they have to though right</p>
<p>I actually didn&rsquo;t look that up</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they have to</p>
<p>because some would say that</p>
<p>the grounds in London have been around forever</p>
<p>right so like</p>
<p>where isn&rsquo;t a place</p>
<p>a piece of land that isn&rsquo;t contaminated with</p>
<p>death and blood and stabbings and killings and stuff</p>
<p>and that my friends</p>
<p>is a story about John Christie</p>
<p>and the awful crimes that he committed</p>
<p>for no reason</p>
<p>what was his motive</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>most of the times</p>
<p>I feel like we can get some kind of understanding</p>
<p>by these serial killers upbringing</p>
<p>but there just wasn&rsquo;t that much information</p>
<p>about his mom and dad</p>
<p>other than his dad was</p>
<p>like strict</p>
<p>and his mom was like</p>
<p>bathing them</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really all I could find</p>
<p>like what was his deal man</p>
<p>he just wanted revenge</p>
<p>against people that made fun of him maybe</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>this is just</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a piece of shit anyways</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the awful story about John Christie</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know what to say</p>
<p>what can he say at that point</p>
<p>I hope you guys have a wonderful day today</p>
<p>I just really love and appreciate you guys</p>
<p>so much for hanging out with me</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t say thank you enough for all the love and support</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re constantly throwing my way</p>

<p>I just don&rsquo;t know how to</p>
<p>voice vocalize how thankful I am for you</p>
<p>and I just really appreciate you</p>
<p>but other than that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be seeing you guys guys later bye</p>
