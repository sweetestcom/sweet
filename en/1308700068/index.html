    <p>Our card this week is Aaron Lamont Smalls,</p>
<p>the Ace of Spades from Virginia.</p>
<p>When Aaron was found shot to death in 2001,</p>
<p>investigators dug through piles of tips</p>
<p>and several key pieces of evidence</p>
<p>to try and find his killer.</p>
<p>But each lead seemed to dry up quicker than the last,</p>
<p>and the case eventually went cold.</p>
<p>Now, more than 20 years later,</p>
<p>investigators are still hopeful</p>
<p>that they can uncover the truth for his family</p>
<p>and get to the bottom of this case.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>♪♪</p>
<p>♪♪</p>
<p>Deputies from the York-Pocosin Sheriff&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>were going about their evening</p>
<p>patrolling the streets of York County, Virginia,</p>
<p>when they got a call from dispatch</p>
<p>about an abandoned vehicle.</p>
<p>A sedan had been parked at the Country Club Apartments</p>
<p>on the northwest edge of the county for several days,</p>
<p>and the management company wanted it gone.</p>
<p>So they headed over to the complex to check it out.</p>
<p>By the time they pulled in, it was about 7 p.m.,</p>
<p>so things were pretty quiet.</p>
<p>Most people were inside their units for the night,</p>
<p>and so it didn&rsquo;t take long for them</p>
<p>to spot the car in question.</p>
<p>It was parked in a spot just off to the side</p>
<p>of one of the buildings, and, at least from the outside,</p>
<p>it appeared to be in working order.</p>
<p>Sheriff Ron Montgomery wasn&rsquo;t the one on the scene that night.</p>
<p>He was the chief deputy at the time.</p>
<p>But he told our reporter nothing stood out</p>
<p>when his deputies got a closer look.</p>
<p>— So, at the time that we were there,</p>
<p>there were no keys found with the vehicle,</p>
<p>nobody around the vehicle.</p>
<p>The deputy got out and opened the car doors.</p>
<p>The only thing that was unusual about it at that point</p>
<p>was the back seat was missing out of the vehicle.</p>
<p>— When the deputies ran the license plate,</p>
<p>they found that it had been reported stolen</p>
<p>about two weeks ago, on January 25, 2001,</p>
<p>and it was now February 6.</p>
<p>According to the registration,</p>
<p>it belonged to a woman whom I&rsquo;ll just call V.</p>
<p>Her address on file showed that she lived in Newport News,</p>
<p>which was just about 20 minutes south of the apartment</p>
<p>where the car was found.</p>
<p>They gave V a call and filled her in on what they had found,</p>
<p>saying that she could come pick up her car</p>
<p>directly from the complex.</p>
<p>Even though there weren&rsquo;t any keys at the scene,</p>
<p>V said that she had a spare,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;d make her way up there later that evening.</p>
<p>Thinking the situation was handled,</p>
<p>the deputies went back to their patrol.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t long after that the sheriff&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>got another call.</p>
<p>This time, it was from V herself.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d gone to pick up the car,</p>
<p>and before she drove off in it,</p>
<p>she decided to check the trunk</p>
<p>to see if the back seat had maybe been stowed in there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a 1984 Chevy Celebrity,</p>
<p>so think, like, super deep trunk and hook-and-eye seats.</p>
<p>Anyway, everything else in the car seemed to be fine.</p>
<p>But when she got to the back and popped the trunk,</p>
<p>she discovered something horrific.</p>
<p>Stuffed inside was the body of her boyfriend, Aaron.</p>
<p>Well, that obviously prompted us to return to the scene.</p>
<p>And ultimately, we discovered that the individual</p>
<p>that was in the back, stuffed in the trunk,</p>
<p>was Aaron Smalls, a Black male out of Newport News, Virginia.</p>
<p>Aaron, who was known almost exclusively</p>
<p>by his nickname, Peanut,</p>
<p>had been missing since January 25th,</p>
<p>the same day she&rsquo;d reported her car stolen.</p>
<p>And just a quick side note,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna call him Peanut from now on,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ll hear Sheriff Montgomery</p>
<p>use both Peanut and Aaron interchangeably.</p>
<p>In the trunk, Peanut&rsquo;s body didn&rsquo;t show</p>
<p>any obvious signs of decomposition.</p>
<p>He only had on one shoe, a slipper with a hard sole.</p>
<p>But investigators couldn&rsquo;t see anything else</p>
<p>without moving his body.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s our protocol that once we found</p>
<p>that there was someone in the trunk that was obviously dead,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t disturb the body</p>
<p>until the medical examiner got there.</p>
<p>While they waited, they turned their attention back to Vee.</p>
<p>She told them that she and Peanut lived together</p>
<p>in Newport News with his son.</p>
<p>He was originally from Philadelphia,</p>
<p>and most of his family,</p>
<p>including his son&rsquo;s mother, still lived there.</p>
<p>And it seemed like, despite the distance,</p>
<p>he was pretty close to them.</p>
<p>In fact, on the day he went missing,</p>
<p>his brother was actually in town for a visit.</p>
<p>And according to Vee, he was the last person to see Peanut.</p>
<p>She told deputies that the story</p>
<p>his brother had been telling everyone</p>
<p>was that on the morning of the 25th,</p>
<p>Peanut said that he needed to run to a cell store</p>
<p>to add minutes to the phone that he had just recently bought,</p>
<p>Hello 2001.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;d grabbed the keys to Vee&rsquo;s car</p>
<p>and walked out the door.</p>
<p>So the last time that anyone saw him</p>
<p>was his brother at 8.30 in the morning</p>
<p>when he left and said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go get minutes from my cell phone.</p>
<p>As far as I know, no one saw him again thereafter.</p>
<p>Not that it&rsquo;s ever reached out to us anyway.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure where Vee was during all of this,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s where things really get interesting.</p>
<p>When Peanut didn&rsquo;t return with the car,</p>
<p>she reported it stolen,</p>
<p>but Peanut himself wasn&rsquo;t reported missing</p>
<p>until January 28th.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s three days after he was last seen.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t explain this gap in time</p>
<p>and the NNPD wasn&rsquo;t able to confirm</p>
<p>who filed the missing persons report.</p>
<p>So I could be missing some context here,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an odd detail</p>
<p>that I just can&rsquo;t get out of my head.</p>
<p>Why report the car missing,</p>
<p>but not the man who drove off in it?</p>
<p>And actually not just missing,</p>
<p>you reported the car stolen.</p>
<p>Now, from what I can tell,</p>
<p>it seems like the stolen status</p>
<p>was more for attention on the missing car,</p>
<p>not to try and say that Peanut had taken it</p>
<p>or anything shady like that.</p>
<p>Now, before they could question Vee any further,</p>
<p>the medical examiner arrived.</p>
<p>And once the body was removed from the trunk</p>
<p>was when we could see</p>
<p>that there was an obvious shotgun blast</p>
<p>to the chest area.</p>
<p>With Peanut&rsquo;s body on the way to the ME&rsquo;s office,</p>
<p>investigators were able to do</p>
<p>a more thorough search of the car.</p>
<p>His missing slipper was nowhere to be found,</p>
<p>but tucked into the back of the trunk</p>
<p>were two t-shirts stained with blood and a cell phone.</p>
<p>In fact, the whole trunk was surprisingly tidy.</p>
<p>Sure, there was some blood from the wound on Peanut&rsquo;s chest,</p>
<p>but not the amount you&rsquo;d expect to find</p>
<p>from such a brutal injury.</p>
<p>And the body of the car</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have any bloodstains or anything either.</p>
<p>So investigators immediately thought</p>
<p>that Peanut was likely killed outside of the car</p>
<p>and then just put into the trunk.</p>
<p>A lot of the reporting on this case</p>
<p>mentioned that cocaine was found in the vehicle as well,</p>
<p>but Sheriff Montgomery said that was just a rumor.</p>
<p>Besides the two shirts and the phone,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t find anything else.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other investigators were canvassing the complex</p>
<p>and interviewing as many residents as they could.</p>
<p>And luckily, many of them came forward</p>
<p>because the unfamiliar car</p>
<p>had really stood out in this neighborhood.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a high crime area.</p>
<p>If you talk about major crimes like robberies,</p>
<p>murders, that type of thing,</p>
<p>basically larcenies from vehicles.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve had some issues</p>
<p>with people dealing drugs up there in the past,</p>
<p>but pretty much the same thing that you can find</p>
<p>in other apartment complexes as well.</p>
<p>The timing of when the car appeared varied.</p>
<p>What investigators could tell</p>
<p>was that it&rsquo;d been there about two weeks,</p>
<p>which fit the date that Peanut had disappeared.</p>
<p>But not one person said they&rsquo;d heard anything suspicious</p>
<p>during that timeframe, like gunshots or a fight,</p>
<p>which indicated Peanut&rsquo;s murder</p>
<p>had taken place away from the complex.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have any idea</p>
<p>where the shooting actually occurred.</p>
<p>It clearly didn&rsquo;t occur in the parking lot</p>
<p>of the apartment complex</p>
<p>or somebody would have heard that or seen it.</p>
<p>So he was killed somewhere else,</p>
<p>put in the trunk of the car,</p>
<p>and then that car was dropped off</p>
<p>at Country Club Apartments.</p>
<p>Despite no one witnessing the homicide,</p>
<p>some residents had seen someone with the car.</p>
<p>And this person wasn&rsquo;t Peanut.</p>
<p>They said it was a man who was black, clean-shaven,</p>
<p>roughly six feet tall, maybe 180 pounds,</p>
<p>and in his late 20s to early 30s.</p>
<p>Those who saw this man said that he had been</p>
<p>in or around the car the first couple of days</p>
<p>after Peanut went missing.</p>
<p>There was actually some people that claimed</p>
<p>that they saw him driving the car.</p>
<p>And then the best description claimed</p>
<p>that they saw him get out of the car,</p>
<p>walk around it a couple of times.</p>
<p>There was even one resident who claimed</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;d spoken to this guy.</p>
<p>He told investigators that the man got out</p>
<p>of the parked car, approached him,</p>
<p>and asked for a cigarette.</p>
<p>He matched the description the other residents gave them.</p>
<p>But this witness got a clear view of what he was wearing,</p>
<p>dark jeans, a dark jacket, and a knit cap.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if the witness gave the man a cigarette,</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t really talk much more,</p>
<p>and eventually the guy left.</p>
<p>Although the witness couldn&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>if he had gotten back in the car or just walked off.</p>
<p>I know it feels like the witness should have been able</p>
<p>to give more detail about this guy</p>
<p>since they were face-to-face,</p>
<p>but remember, it&rsquo;s been two weeks at this point.</p>
<p>Like, do you remember every single person</p>
<p>that you have had an interaction with throughout your day?</p>
<p>I know I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Anyway, in the end, investigators didn&rsquo;t have enough</p>
<p>of a description for a composite sketch,</p>
<p>but they took what information they had gathered</p>
<p>and released it to local media</p>
<p>in case someone out there knew the man.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t get any hits right off the bat,</p>
<p>so they shifted their focus back to Peanut.</p>
<p>They wanted to gather as much information about him</p>
<p>and his disappearance as they could,</p>
<p>and they started by circling back to V.</p>
<p>This time, investigators interviewed her at the station.</p>
<p>Her story didn&rsquo;t change at all, but just to be safe,</p>
<p>they asked if she would take a polygraph.</p>
<p>She agreed to the test, and she passed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if she was ever able to explain</p>
<p>the three-day gap between reporting the car stolen</p>
<p>and Peanut being reported missing,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m assuming investigators at the time</p>
<p>were able to clear that up</p>
<p>because they cleared her of any involvement.</p>
<p>Over the next couple of days,</p>
<p>they interviewed as many of Peanut&rsquo;s other friends</p>
<p>and family as they could,</p>
<p>and everyone they spoke to was devastated by his death.</p>
<p>They said as soon as they realized that he was missing,</p>
<p>everyone was super concerned.</p>
<p>Even though he was 25, it wasn&rsquo;t normal for him</p>
<p>to go anywhere without at least telling one person</p>
<p>where he was gonna be.</p>
<p>Before Peanut disappeared, his friends and family</p>
<p>said that he was acting totally normal.</p>
<p>Even as he was walking out the door for the last time,</p>
<p>his brother told investigators nothing seemed off.</p>
<p>So when he hadn&rsquo;t turned back up,</p>
<p>all of Peanut&rsquo;s loved ones knew that something was wrong,</p>
<p>and they came together to look for him.</p>
<p>They did the same thing that most anyone else would do.</p>
<p>They would call around and ask if anybody had seen him,</p>
<p>and they made people aware</p>
<p>that he was missing along with the car.</p>
<p>After speaking with his friends and family,</p>
<p>investigators headed to the cell phone store next</p>
<p>to confirm if he had made it there.</p>
<p>But they couldn&rsquo;t find any evidence</p>
<p>that he had ever been to the store on the 24th.</p>
<p>So they circled back to the family to try and see</p>
<p>if maybe there was somewhere else that he could have gone.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when they learned that Peanut had recently been</p>
<p>in some trouble with the law.</p>
<p>We do have family members who acknowledged</p>
<p>that they knew that Aaron was, in fact, dealing drugs.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s any evidence</p>
<p>that he was moving large amounts.</p>
<p>It sounded more like smaller amounts of marijuana</p>
<p>and cocaine that he was moving on a regular basis.</p>
<p>At the time that Aaron disappeared,</p>
<p>there were actually indictments out for him</p>
<p>from a local drug task force on drug charges.</p>
<p>Based on the other information that we had had,</p>
<p>you know, from the family and from the task force,</p>
<p>he was in and out of the upper part of the county,</p>
<p>which is that area,</p>
<p>at least on a fairly regular basis anyway.</p>
<p>So he wouldn&rsquo;t have been a stranger to that area.</p>
<p>With this information,</p>
<p>investigators thought this could be their missing link.</p>
<p>Maybe Peanut had gone to make a drug deal up in York County</p>
<p>before going to the store and then something went wrong.</p>
<p>Well, based on experience,</p>
<p>you would think that the life</p>
<p>that Aaron Smalls was leading</p>
<p>was probably somehow related to what caused his death.</p>
<p>I mean, over the years,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked multiple cases where someone owes you money,</p>
<p>you owe someone money,</p>
<p>and this is the result, you know,</p>
<p>the fact that they get tired of waiting for what they&rsquo;re owed</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to make an example.</p>
<p>Despite living what might have been considered</p>
<p>a risky lifestyle,</p>
<p>investigators couldn&rsquo;t find any other red flags.</p>
<p>Peanut&rsquo;s family couldn&rsquo;t pinpoint any known enemies,</p>
<p>any history of bad drug deals</p>
<p>or even run-ins with shady characters.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t even think of anyone</p>
<p>who matched the description of the guy seen with V&rsquo;s car.</p>
<p>And investigators weren&rsquo;t able to find anything</p>
<p>to connect Peanut to the complex itself either,</p>
<p>like he didn&rsquo;t seem to know anyone who lived there</p>
<p>or in the surrounding area.</p>
<p>So next, they decided to check his cell phone records</p>
<p>on the chance that they could maybe dig up a lead there.</p>
<p>And since they had what they assumed was his cell phone,</p>
<p>it shouldn&rsquo;t have been a problem.</p>
<p>But when they took another look</p>
<p>at the phone that was found in the trunk,</p>
<p>they realized it wasn&rsquo;t Peanut&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The phone wasn&rsquo;t a prepaid cell like Peanut&rsquo;s was.</p>
<p>And when they looked into the number,</p>
<p>they found that it was actually registered to a woman.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just call her Wanda.</p>
<p>So next step, find Wanda and ask how her phone</p>
<p>ended up in the trunk under a dead man.</p>
<p>But she was yet another dead end.</p>
<p>Well, the phone owner stated she lost the phone</p>
<p>at Greenbrier Mall around January of 2001.</p>
<p>Now, I had a ton of questions about Wanda.</p>
<p>Like, what are the odds that you lose your phone in a mall</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s about an hour away, by the way,</p>
<p>and then it shows up a month later in the trunk</p>
<p>of a reportedly stolen car with a murdered man?</p>
<p>But the only additional information</p>
<p>Sheriff Montgomery could provide</p>
<p>was that Wanda didn&rsquo;t know Peanut</p>
<p>or anyone associated with the case.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if they dove into her phone</p>
<p>to see if they could put some pieces together.</p>
<p>She seems like just another one of those</p>
<p>frustrating loose ends that I can&rsquo;t tie up</p>
<p>because we just don&rsquo;t have the information.</p>
<p>But even without Peanut&rsquo;s physical phone,</p>
<p>they were still able to pull records</p>
<p>from the last two weeks of activity before he went missing.</p>
<p>Now, they couldn&rsquo;t track his whereabouts,</p>
<p>but they could see who he communicated with.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, though, nothing stood out.</p>
<p>No unknown numbers or calls made at weird hours.</p>
<p>Peanut had been using the phone</p>
<p>for the same reasons we all do,</p>
<p>to keep in touch with loved ones.</p>
<p>And when his autopsy results came back soon after,</p>
<p>investigators hit yet another wall.</p>
<p>The report basically confirmed</p>
<p>what investigators already knew.</p>
<p>Peanut had been killed by a gunshot wound</p>
<p>to the front of his chest,</p>
<p>most likely from a 12-gauge shotgun.</p>
<p>Other than that injury, he didn&rsquo;t have any other marks</p>
<p>or abrasions on his body,</p>
<p>so it didn&rsquo;t seem like there was any sort of struggle</p>
<p>before his death.</p>
<p>And nothing stood out in his toxicology report</p>
<p>that would send investigators in any kind of other direction.</p>
<p>The only thing that really stood out</p>
<p>was that the medical examiner</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t able to determine his time of death.</p>
<p>Peanut&rsquo;s body wasn&rsquo;t very decomposed,</p>
<p>but that didn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that he had been killed</p>
<p>right before he was found.</p>
<p>The report stated that he could have been preserved,</p>
<p>thanks to the combination of the sealed trunk</p>
<p>and the chilly winter weather.</p>
<p>-&ldquo;We know that, you know, on the date that we found the car,</p>
<p>that obviously he died within a fairly short time</p>
<p>prior to that, whether it was days or a week,</p>
<p>there really isn&rsquo;t any way to know,</p>
<p>other than we have a start date,</p>
<p>which is the last day he&rsquo;s seen,</p>
<p>and then the day that he&rsquo;s found,</p>
<p>and in between there, any one of those days are possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that point, investigators decided to turn back</p>
<p>to the public for help.</p>
<p>They put out another call for information about the case,</p>
<p>and an acquaintance of V&rsquo;s came forward</p>
<p>and said they&rsquo;d seen a car</p>
<p>matching the description of V&rsquo;s vehicle</p>
<p>at a fast-food restaurant on January 27th,</p>
<p>just two days after Peanut disappeared.</p>
<p>-&ldquo;There was an individual who saw the car</p>
<p>at a Dodgers chicken place on Jefferson Avenue</p>
<p>in the Denbigh area of Newport News,</p>
<p>but the individual driving the car</p>
<p>did not match Aaron&rsquo;s description.</p>
<p>They did not believe that was Aaron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While this witness was certain Peanut wasn&rsquo;t the one driving,</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t able to provide a very clear description</p>
<p>of the person who was.</p>
<p>All they could say for sure was that the driver was a black male,</p>
<p>and this immediately made investigators</p>
<p>think of the man seen with the car at the apartment complex,</p>
<p>due just to the timing.</p>
<p>-&ldquo;I would say that we would make that assumption</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s probably the same person</p>
<p>that was seen getting out of the car up at Country Club.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all in the same time frame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They still couldn&rsquo;t ID the man, though,</p>
<p>but there were also other tips coming in that they dug into,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when they came across a woman who I&rsquo;ll call Stephanie.</p>
<p>She was a friend of Peanut&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and she had a story about an incident</p>
<p>that took place before he disappeared</p>
<p>that seemed like it might be a promising lead.</p>
<p>Stephanie told investigators that a couple of days</p>
<p>before Peanut went missing,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;d gotten a call from a man who was looking for him.</p>
<p>This guy, who I&rsquo;ll call Daryl,</p>
<p>was a loose acquaintance of Stephanie&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Like, she knew him well enough to recognize</p>
<p>who he was when he called,</p>
<p>but she didn&rsquo;t even know his last name.</p>
<p>Anyway, Daryl said that he needed to get a hold of Peanut</p>
<p>because Peanut was holding on to something that belonged to him,</p>
<p>and he needed it back.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s all the information he would give,</p>
<p>so Stephanie had turned to Peanut for answers.</p>
<p>-&ldquo;She saw Peanut later that day,</p>
<p>made him aware of this phone call,</p>
<p>and, according to her, said that he was holding a firearm.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t say whether it was a handgun, shotgun, what it was.</p>
<p>And that was all the information that she had about it.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t inquire any further.</p>
<p>And after this pretest statement,</p>
<p>she was polygraphed on whether or not</p>
<p>she had any specific information about Peanut.</p>
<p>Did she know who killed Peanut?</p>
<p>And she, according to the polygraph examiner,</p>
<p>she showed no deceit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the next step was to track down Daryl.</p>
<p>And when they did, he admitted that Stephanie&rsquo;s story was true.</p>
<p>From what I can tell, though, he didn&rsquo;t give investigators</p>
<p>a reason as to why Peanut was holding the gun for him.</p>
<p>But Sheriff Montgomery had his own suspicions.</p>
<p>-&ldquo;Sometimes they&rsquo;re involved in crimes,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t want to get rid of the gun,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t want to be caught with it either.</p>
<p>So you pass it on to a trusted friend or accomplice and say,</p>
<p>hang on to this for me for whatever reason</p>
<p>for a period of time.</p>
<p>Sometimes law enforcement&rsquo;s fortunate enough</p>
<p>to get a hold of that gun and trace it back to crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>-&ldquo;Did you get a hold of the gun</p>
<p>that Peanut was supposedly holding on to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>-&ldquo;No. No.</p>
<p>We never found any firearms</p>
<p>that were associated with this case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daryl was adamant that he didn&rsquo;t have anything</p>
<p>to do with Peanut&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>And since they couldn&rsquo;t find this firearm</p>
<p>or a single shred of evidence that he could be involved,</p>
<p>investigators were once again forced to move on to another tip.</p>
<p>You see, a single house slipper matching the description</p>
<p>of Peanut&rsquo;s shoe was found in Newport News.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know who found it or how police were notified,</p>
<p>but the tip said that the shoe was in a field</p>
<p>at an industrial park.</p>
<p>When investigators heard about this,</p>
<p>they were over the moon.</p>
<p>This could be the second crime scene</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d been looking for.</p>
<p>But when they checked it out,</p>
<p>the slipper was the only thing they could find.</p>
<p>There was nothing to indicate</p>
<p>that this location was connected to the homicide.</p>
<p>And besides the fact that it looked similar,</p>
<p>investigators weren&rsquo;t even able to match this slipper</p>
<p>to the one Peanut was wearing.</p>
<p>They tried running some tests on it</p>
<p>to try and get DNA from both shoes,</p>
<p>but they couldn&rsquo;t connect them.</p>
<p>So this was yet another dead end.</p>
<p>It was around this time, though,</p>
<p>that all that other evidence that they had sent off for testing</p>
<p>finally came back from the lab.</p>
<p>First, they learned that V&rsquo;s car was even cleaner</p>
<p>than they thought.</p>
<p>They tested it for fingerprints, for blood, whatever,</p>
<p>but every single test they ran came back negative.</p>
<p>And it turns out the exterior had been wiped down.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s where I find myself going back</p>
<p>to the missing back seat.</p>
<p>Like, if the car was super clean,</p>
<p>there had to be a reason</p>
<p>that someone would remove an entire seat, right?</p>
<p>Well, whatever the reason was,</p>
<p>neither Sheriff Montgomery</p>
<p>nor any of the articles I read offered an explanation.</p>
<p>So again, just another loose end.</p>
<p>The only other thing that the lab could tell them</p>
<p>was that the blood found on the two shirts in the trunk</p>
<p>was Peanut&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<p>But that was all they could get.</p>
<p>So with no other evidence to test or no new tips coming in,</p>
<p>the case started to cool off</p>
<p>and months started going by with nothing new.</p>
<p>That is until they got a call later in 2001</p>
<p>from an inmate at the Virginia Peninsula Regional Jail.</p>
<p>We got contacted by an inmate in the jail</p>
<p>who had had a conversation with another individual,</p>
<p>a cellmate, and that person had said,</p>
<p>my cousin had something to do with Peanut&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>And the name of the cousin was familiar to us as well.</p>
<p>We had had dealings with that individual in the past.</p>
<p>The inmate claimed that the information was</p>
<p>that the shotgun that was used in the homicide</p>
<p>was thrown into a drainage ditch or a drainage culvert</p>
<p>in a neighborhood not far from where Peanut was found.</p>
<p>The jail is in York County,</p>
<p>literally five minutes from the apartment complex</p>
<p>where Peanut was found.</p>
<p>So investigators headed over there</p>
<p>to talk with this other inmate.</p>
<p>But when they asked him about the story his cellmate told,</p>
<p>he denied ever making any statements about Peanut&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s more, he claimed he didn&rsquo;t even have a cousin</p>
<p>by the name that the cellmate gave investigators.</p>
<p>But they weren&rsquo;t just gonna take this guy&rsquo;s word for it.</p>
<p>This was the best lead they&rsquo;d had in months.</p>
<p>So they went out and searched for this shotgun</p>
<p>over the course of two days.</p>
<p>Investigators along with public works people</p>
<p>from York County actually put devices down into,</p>
<p>cameras down into the sewage system</p>
<p>for considerable amounts of distance</p>
<p>through the whole neighborhood,</p>
<p>never could locate a shotgun in any of the locations</p>
<p>that were remotely close to what was described</p>
<p>by the person in jail.</p>
<p>Investigators were once again forced to move on.</p>
<p>Time started flying by and according to reporting</p>
<p>by David McCauley for the Daily Press,</p>
<p>there wasn&rsquo;t any movement in the case for five years.</p>
<p>But as time went on, so did advancements in DNA technology.</p>
<p>And in July 2006, investigators decided to send</p>
<p>those two shirts from the trunk off for more testing.</p>
<p>And this time they got a profile,</p>
<p>a profile that wasn&rsquo;t Peanut&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Investigators were hopeful that this was their big break.</p>
<p>So they uploaded the profile to the Virginia DNA Data Bank,</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t get any hits.</p>
<p>That is until May of 2007, when boom, out of nowhere,</p>
<p>there was a database hit on the DNA profile.</p>
<p>The profile matched to a 32-year-old man</p>
<p>who I&rsquo;ll call Anthony.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d recently been convicted of a felony,</p>
<p>although Sheriff Montgomery couldn&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>what the crime was.</p>
<p>When investigators started looking into him,</p>
<p>they realized Anthony actually knew Peanut&rsquo;s girlfriend, V.</p>
<p>It turns out he was the father of her child.</p>
<p>Now my source didn&rsquo;t know much about their relationship</p>
<p>or their kid, like how old they were or who they lived with,</p>
<p>but it sounded like Anthony and V saw each other</p>
<p>pretty frequently due to their shared</p>
<p>parenting responsibilities.</p>
<p>And when investigators started asking around about this guy,</p>
<p>they learned that Anthony knew Peanut too.</p>
<p>Actually, he was a known associate of Peanut.</p>
<p>Once we drilled down into some of the interviews,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t uncommon for them to be seen together.</p>
<p>They finally tracked Anthony down in August.</p>
<p>And when they told him about the DNA match,</p>
<p>he was like, well, of course my DNA popped up.</p>
<p>Those are my shirts.</p>
<p>At some point, he says he&rsquo;d left them with V or in the trunk</p>
<p>and they had been there for a while before the murder.</p>
<p>So that was his explanation for why a shirt with his DNA</p>
<p>would be in that vehicle,</p>
<p>which at that point was a plausible explanation.</p>
<p>Just like everyone else they&rsquo;d questioned in this case,</p>
<p>Anthony swore up and down that he didn&rsquo;t have anything</p>
<p>to do with Peanut&rsquo;s homicide.</p>
<p>Throughout the interview,</p>
<p>he fully cooperated with investigators</p>
<p>and he even agreed to give them another DNA sample</p>
<p>to compare to the profile they had,</p>
<p>which they did and it was a match again,</p>
<p>but they just didn&rsquo;t feel like Anthony was their guy.</p>
<p>If he was as close with V and Peanut as it seemed,</p>
<p>then it wouldn&rsquo;t be out of the realm of possibility</p>
<p>for some of his stuff, like the shirts,</p>
<p>to end up in their possession.</p>
<p>Just to be extra sure,</p>
<p>investigators tried to come up</p>
<p>with other more sinister explanations</p>
<p>for why the shirts may have been there,</p>
<p>but ultimately they couldn&rsquo;t find anything.</p>
<p>And with that, Peanut&rsquo;s case went ice cold.</p>
<p>Since 2007, investigators have tried</p>
<p>to revive it many times.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve released more pleas for information to the public</p>
<p>and worked with local and national media</p>
<p>to keep Peanut&rsquo;s story in the news.</p>
<p>They even went back and re-interviewed Anthony</p>
<p>around 2012, 2013, just to be sure his story checked out,</p>
<p>but it did and they were never able to regain any momentum.</p>
<p>And despite their best efforts,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve never found Peanut&rsquo;s cell phone.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve never found the murder weapon or the keys</p>
<p>or the backseat from V&rsquo;s car,</p>
<p>or even the crime scene</p>
<p>where they believe Peanut was really killed.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve never ID&rsquo;d that man</p>
<p>spotted driving V&rsquo;s car either.</p>
<p>But while the lack of leads</p>
<p>has been frustrating for investigators,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s taken the greatest toll on Peanut&rsquo;s loved ones</p>
<p>who have never given up hope</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ll one day have closure.</p>
<p>We get a call at least once a year</p>
<p>from some relatives from Philadelphia</p>
<p>asking if there&rsquo;s any developments in the case.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been thankful that we have resurrected the case</p>
<p>a couple of times on local news channels</p>
<p>and on national media,</p>
<p>but to this point,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have any real person of interest</p>
<p>or any one person that we&rsquo;re zeroing in on.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about it is</p>
<p>various people have given bits and pieces of information</p>
<p>that weren&rsquo;t publicly known</p>
<p>enough to draw your interest to how would you know that,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t lead anywhere right now.</p>
<p>For example, we didn&rsquo;t publicize</p>
<p>that he was killed by a shotgun blast.</p>
<p>So when this person claimed in a jailhouse interview</p>
<p>that it was a shotgun that was used</p>
<p>or at least insinuated that it was</p>
<p>and put in the sewage drain,</p>
<p>that intrigued us because how else would you know?</p>
<p>After his murder,</p>
<p>Peanut&rsquo;s son went back to Philadelphia</p>
<p>to live with his mother.</p>
<p>And while he&rsquo;s surrounded by family members</p>
<p>who love and support him,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s grown up without ever knowing</p>
<p>why his father was taken away.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a young man out there</p>
<p>that grew up without his father</p>
<p>and his mother, as far as I know,</p>
<p>and some of his relatives are still alive.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;d probably like to know</p>
<p>that the person that committed this crime has faced justice.</p>
<p>You would think with the amount of time gone by,</p>
<p>the only way that this crime&rsquo;s gonna be solved,</p>
<p>that if someone has specific knowledge of it,</p>
<p>was to come forward at this point in time</p>
<p>and make us aware of some piece of evidence</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve not been made aware of before now.</p>
<p>And as time goes by,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably less likely that that occurs.</p>
<p>And I would like to think that somebody will hear this</p>
<p>and go, you know, we&rsquo;re gonna make that phone call.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s gonna take to solve this case.</p>
<p>If you have any information</p>
<p>about the 2001 murder of Aaron Lamont Smalls,</p>
<p>also known as Peanut,</p>
<p>please don&rsquo;t hesitate to call</p>
<p>the York-Pocosin Sheriff&rsquo;s Office</p>
