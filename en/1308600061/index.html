    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Dr. David Spiegel.</p>
<p>Dr. Spiegel is the Associate Chair</p>
<p>of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences</p>
<p>at Stanford University School of Medicine.</p>
<p>He is also the Director of the Stanford Center</p>
<p>on Stress and Health.</p>
<p>Dr. Spiegel is both a researcher and a clinician,</p>
<p>meaning he runs a laboratory</p>
<p>that studies the brain and the body</p>
<p>and neural mechanisms of how the brain and body interact,</p>
<p>and he sees patients as a psychiatrist at Stanford.</p>
<p>His work is incredibly unique</p>
<p>in that it bridges mind and body,</p>
<p>but it also has a particular focus</p>
<p>on the clinical applications of hypnosis.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;ll learn today,</p>
<p>hypnosis is a unique brain state</p>
<p>in which neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>the brain&rsquo;s ability to change in response to experience,</p>
<p>may be heightened.</p>
<p>And indeed, the use of clinical hypnosis</p>
<p>by Dr. Spiegel and colleagues</p>
<p>has been shown to improve symptoms of stress,</p>
<p>chronic anxiety, chronic pain,</p>
<p>and various other illnesses,</p>
<p>including many psychiatric illnesses</p>
<p>and even outcomes in cancer.</p>
<p>Today, we discuss hypnosis in the context</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s called self-hypnosis</p>
<p>to distinguish it from stage hypnosis.</p>
<p>Many of you are probably familiar with stage hypnosis,</p>
<p>which is really about a hypnotist getting a person</p>
<p>to do things they would not otherwise do.</p>
<p>In contrast, clinical hypnosis</p>
<p>and the use of hypnosis for the treatment</p>
<p>of various ailments of mind and body is vastly different.</p>
<p>It involves getting people to change their brain state</p>
<p>and to use that brain state as a portal</p>
<p>to make adjustments in their brain and body</p>
<p>and other aspects of their biology and psychology</p>
<p>that benefit them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been shown over and over again</p>
<p>in studies by Dr. Spiegel and colleagues</p>
<p>that those changes can occur extremely quickly.</p>
<p>Not everybody can be hypnotized as readily as the next.</p>
<p>And so today we also discuss a simple test</p>
<p>developed by Dr. Spiegel that can help you determine</p>
<p>whether or not you have a high, medium,</p>
<p>or low degree of what we call hypnotize ability.</p>
<p>Dr. Spiegel is truly an expert in this area.</p>
<p>He has published over 480 journal articles,</p>
<p>170 book chapters on hypnosis</p>
<p>and on things like psychosocial oncology,</p>
<p>which is the interaction of mind and body</p>
<p>in the treatment of cancer and cancer outcomes</p>
<p>on stress physiology, trauma,</p>
<p>and other aspects of psychotherapy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s published 13 books.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s truly the world expert in hypnosis</p>
<p>and clinical applications of hypnosis for mind and body.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certain that in listening to today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to learn a tremendous amount</p>
<p>about how the brain and body interact,</p>
<p>about various treatments</p>
<p>for all sorts of common ailments of mind and body.</p>
<p>And you are going to get access to tools,</p>
<p>in particular, a tool that was developed by Dr. Spiegel,</p>
<p>which is the Reverie app, R-E-V-E-R-I.</p>
<p>The Reverie app is currently only available for Apple,</p>
<p>but will soon also be available for Android.</p>
<p>It does carry a nominal cost,</p>
<p>but there is a seven day free trial.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try it,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re providing a link in the show notes.</p>
<p>The Reverie app is special in that it is based</p>
<p>on clinical studies and research done</p>
<p>in the Spiegel lab at Stanford.</p>
<p>So unlike a lot of hypnosis apps out there</p>
<p>and resources for hypnosis,</p>
<p>it was developed with clinical treatments in mind.</p>
<p>Today, we also discussed the use of breathwork,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m very fortunate that my research lab at Stanford</p>
<p>has been collaborating very closely with Dr. Spiegel</p>
<p>in testing and developing specific breathwork protocols</p>
<p>to adjust mind and body for things like anxiety,</p>
<p>improving mood, and improving sleep.</p>
<p>Based on his incredible and unique expertise</p>
<p>and the clarity with which Dr. Spiegel</p>
<p>communicates information,</p>
<p>I anticipate that you will really enjoy today&rsquo;s episode</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;ll come away from it</p>
<p>with a lot of actionable tools.</p>
<p>Some of you might be curious</p>
<p>what a clinical hypnosis session looks like.</p>
<p>And for that reason, we had Dr. Spiegel hypnotize me.</p>
<p>A clip of that hypnosis session is going to be posted</p>
<p>to the Huberman Lab Clips channel,</p>
<p>which is available on YouTube.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works.</p>
<p>Different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now for my discussion with Dr. David Spiegel.</p>
<p>David, thank you so much for being here.</p>
<p>Andrew, my pleasure.</p>
<p>Can you tell us what is hypnosis?</p>
<p>Hypnosis is a state of highly focused attention.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something like looking through</p>
<p>the telephoto lens of a camera in consciousness.</p>
<p>What you see, you see with great detail,</p>
<p>but devoid of context.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve had the experience of getting so caught up</p>
<p>in a good movie that you forget you&rsquo;re watching a movie</p>
<p>and enter the imagined world,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re part of the movie, not part of the audience,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re experiencing it, you&rsquo;re not evaluating it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a hypnotic-like experience</p>
<p>that many people have in their everyday lives.</p>
<p>So is any experience that really draws us in</p>
<p>hypnotic in that sense?</p>
<p>Or let me give a different example.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m watching a sports game</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m really wrapped up in the game,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m also in touch with how it makes me feel in my body,</p>
<p>kind of registering the excitement or the anticipation,</p>
<p>is that a state of hypnosis also?</p>
<p>Because you mentioned there&rsquo;s kind of a narrowing</p>
<p>of context, but a kind of losing of the self.</p>
<p>Do I have that right?</p>
<p>Yes, it is true that to the extent that your somatic,</p>
<p>your body experience is a part of the sport event</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re engaged with,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that is a self-altering hypnotic experience.</p>
<p>If your physical reactions are distracting you</p>
<p>or make you think about something else,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;s less hypnotic-like</p>
<p>and more just one of a series of experiences.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I have to ask,</p>
<p>how did you get into this business of hypnosis?</p>
<p>Because I think for most people,</p>
<p>when they hear hypnosis or they think about hypnosis,</p>
<p>they think of stage hypnosis.</p>
<p>They think of somebody with a pendant going back and forth</p>
<p>or people up on a stage behaving abnormally</p>
<p>for the entertainment of others.</p>
<p>How did you get into hypnosis as an interest,</p>
<p>as a practice?</p>
<p>And if you would, could you contrast the sort of hypnosis</p>
<p>that you do in the clinical setting</p>
<p>with the sort of hypnosis that a stage hypnotist does?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Well, it is something of a genetic illness in my family.</p>
<p>Both of my parents were psychiatrists and psychoanalysts,</p>
<p>and they told me I was free to be any kind of psychiatrist</p>
<p>I wanted to be, so here I am.</p>
<p>My father was training to be a psychoanalyst in 1943,</p>
<p>and he ran into a Viennese refugee</p>
<p>who couldn&rsquo;t serve in the army,</p>
<p>but who had studied hypnosis.</p>
<p>And actually, it would interest you</p>
<p>doing your ophthalmological research.</p>
<p>He had a smallpox scar right in the middle of his forehead,</p>
<p>and he did forensic examinations,</p>
<p>and he noticed that some of the prisoners</p>
<p>would focus on that spot on his forehead</p>
<p>and then close their eyes and seem to go to sleep,</p>
<p>but they were in some altered state.</p>
<p>So he got interested in hypnosis.</p>
<p>He used it forensically.</p>
<p>His name was Gustav von Aschaffenburg,</p>
<p>and he offered to teach young psychiatrists</p>
<p>how to use hypnosis when they went off into the war.</p>
<p>And so he trained my father,</p>
<p>and my father got off the analytic couch</p>
<p>and the analyst mentioned it to him.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how he found out about it.</p>
<p>And my father said,</p>
<p>did I say something wrong in analysis?</p>
<p>Why is he talking to me now?</p>
<p>And he found it very useful in helping soldiers</p>
<p>who had acute pain when they were wounded</p>
<p>and helping people with conversion</p>
<p>and post-traumatic stress disorders.</p>
<p>And when he came back, he went back to his training,</p>
<p>but he still was sort of interested in it.</p>
<p>And one of his supervisors was Frieda von Reichman,</p>
<p>who was a very famous psychoanalyst.</p>
<p>And he said that he had been told to stop doing hypnosis</p>
<p>because it would ruin his reputation as an analyst.</p>
<p>And she said to him,</p>
<p>what are you so worried about your reputation for?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna give a course at the Institute in hypnosis,</p>
<p>and I know you&rsquo;re gonna do it because I&rsquo;m gonna take it.</p>
<p>So he was teaching Frieda von Reichman hypnosis.</p>
<p>And he just kept doing it.</p>
<p>And after a while,</p>
<p>he discovered that he was getting better results</p>
<p>with a few sessions of hypnosis</p>
<p>than he was with daily psychoanalysis with his patients.</p>
<p>And so he switched his practice.</p>
<p>And so the dinner table conversations</p>
<p>were pretty interesting.</p>
<p>And occasionally when he was making a movie of a patient,</p>
<p>I would get to watch that.</p>
<p>And so when I went to medical school,</p>
<p>I figured I&rsquo;ll take a course.</p>
<p>There was Tom Hackett,</p>
<p>who was the chair of psychiatry at Mass General</p>
<p>was teaching it.</p>
<p>It was a very interesting course.</p>
<p>And the day that converted me was</p>
<p>I was doing my rotation at Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Boston.</p>
<p>And the nurse is telling me,</p>
<p>Spiegel, your next patient is an asthmatic</p>
<p>in room 437 or something.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just following the sound of the wheezes</p>
<p>down the hall.</p>
<p>I go in the room.</p>
<p>This is 16 year old girl,</p>
<p>knuckles white, bolt upright in bed,</p>
<p>struggling for breath.</p>
<p>You can hear the wheezing.</p>
<p>She twice had subcutaneous epinephrine, didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>They were thinking about general anesthesia</p>
<p>and starting her on steroids.</p>
<p>And her mother&rsquo;s there crying.</p>
<p>And I said, I don&rsquo;t know what else to do.</p>
<p>So I said, you want to learn a breathing exercise?</p>
<p>And she nods.</p>
<p>And I got her hypnotized.</p>
<p>And then I realized we hadn&rsquo;t gotten</p>
<p>to asthma in the course yet.</p>
<p>So I made up something very complex.</p>
<p>I said, each breath you take will be a little deeper</p>
<p>and a little easier.</p>
<p>And within five minutes, she&rsquo;s lying back in bed.</p>
<p>Her knuckles aren&rsquo;t white.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not wheezing.</p>
<p>Her mother stopped crying.</p>
<p>The nurse ran out of the room</p>
<p>and the intern, my intern comes to find me.</p>
<p>And I figure he&rsquo;s going to pat me on the back</p>
<p>and say, nice job, Spiegel.</p>
<p>He said, the nurse has filed a complaint</p>
<p>with the nursing supervisor that you violated</p>
<p>a Massachusetts law by hypnotizing a minor</p>
<p>without parental consent.</p>
<p>And I thought, you know, oh, that&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>I doubt there is a law like this.</p>
<p>So the intern says, you&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>to stop doing this with her.</p>
<p>And I said, why?</p>
<p>He said, it&rsquo;s dangerous.</p>
<p>I said, you&rsquo;re going to give her general anesthesia</p>
<p>and put her on steroids and talking to her is dangerous?</p>
<p>He said, well, you&rsquo;ll have to do it.</p>
<p>And I said, I&rsquo;ll tell you what,</p>
<p>take me off the case if you want,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not going to tell a patient of mine</p>
<p>anything I know is not true.</p>
<p>So there was a battle over the weekend</p>
<p>about what to do.</p>
<p>And the intern, the chief resident attending,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all arguing about it.</p>
<p>And on Monday, they came back with a radical idea.</p>
<p>They said, let&rsquo;s ask the patient.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this has ever been done</p>
<p>at Children&rsquo;s Hospital before.</p>
<p>And she said, oh, I like this.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d been hospitalized every month</p>
<p>for three months in status asthmaticus.</p>
<p>She did a one subsequent hospitalization,</p>
<p>but after that went on to study</p>
<p>to be a respiratory therapist.</p>
<p>And I thought that anything that can help a patient</p>
<p>that much violate a non-existent Massachusetts law,</p>
<p>frustrate the nursing supervisor</p>
<p>had to be worth looking into.</p>
<p>So I just kept doing it.</p>
<p>I discovered that there were, you know,</p>
<p>all of my classmates in medical school</p>
<p>had just read the new issue of the New England Journal</p>
<p>and had some new medication to suggest.</p>
<p>And I would, you know, surgeons would say,</p>
<p>look, if you can help this guy with his pain or his anxiety,</p>
<p>anything above the neck, that&rsquo;s yours, do it, Spiegel.</p>
<p>So, you know, I was having fun</p>
<p>and being able to learn how to help people</p>
<p>in a way that just otherwise was not being done.</p>
<p>And so it got me thinking about the fact that, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re born with this brain,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t have a user&rsquo;s manual for it.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t use it nearly as well as we can.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something your research is all about too.</p>
<p>And so I thought, I want to understand this better</p>
<p>and I want to see what we can do.</p>
<p>Stage hypnotists drive me nuts.</p>
<p>You know, they make fools out of people.</p>
<p>There was one, this is a case my father was involved.</p>
<p>He got a call from, he was at Columbia.</p>
<p>He got a call, Spiegel, you got to come see this woman.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s in the ER and she&rsquo;s in some kind of weird,</p>
<p>upset state that happened.</p>
<p>And it turned out she&rsquo;d been on the show</p>
<p>with a stage hypnotist who,</p>
<p>and what they do, by the way, is they cycle around.</p>
<p>You know, they have a, the beginning of the show,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t just grab somebody and say, we&rsquo;re doing this.</p>
<p>They get a bunch of people up.</p>
<p>They do what amounts to hypnotizability testing</p>
<p>to see if people, and they get the ones</p>
<p>who are the most hypnotizable.</p>
<p>So she was the one.</p>
<p>And he said, there&rsquo;s now a little bird in your hand</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to play with the bird.</p>
<p>And she starts to cry and scream.</p>
<p>And he just gets her off the stage</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very upsetting.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s wandering around New York City</p>
<p>in the middle of the night, dissociated,</p>
<p>and brought to Columbia.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where my father saw her.</p>
<p>She was still in a kind of uncomfortable trance-like state.</p>
<p>And it turned out that she was the trophy wife</p>
<p>of a very wealthy guy.</p>
<p>And she felt like a bird in a gilded cage.</p>
<p>And so to her, that image just triggered</p>
<p>all of this sense of dissatisfaction, discomfort,</p>
<p>fear about her life.</p>
<p>And he was able to get her reoriented</p>
<p>and talk with her about what she was going to do</p>
<p>with her life.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t like stage hypnosis.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re making fools out of people.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re using the fact,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what scares people about hypnosis.</p>
<p>They think you&rsquo;re losing control.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gaining control.</p>
<p>Self-hypnosis is a way of enhancing your control</p>
<p>over your mind and your body.</p>
<p>It can work very well.</p>
<p>But because it gives you a kind of cognitive flexibility,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re able to shift sets very easily,</p>
<p>to give up judging and evaluating the way you usually do</p>
<p>and see something from a different point of view.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great therapeutic opportunity.</p>
<p>But if misused, it could be a danger too.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what scares people about it.</p>
<p>It is that very ability to suspend critical judgment</p>
<p>and just have an experience and see what happens.</p>
<p>That can be a great therapeutic opportunity,</p>
<p>but if somebody is misusing it,</p>
<p>it can be a way to harm people.</p>
<p>And, you know, there are plenty of examples</p>
<p>of people having fantasies imposed on them</p>
<p>that they come to think are realities.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not unusual these days.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an ability that if people learn to recognize</p>
<p>and understand it, can be a tremendous therapeutic tool.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been stage hypnotized</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been clinically hypnotized many times</p>
<p>through a self-hypnosis app we&rsquo;ll talk about later.</p>
<p>And then I know we have plans for you to hypnotize me today.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve done it once before</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m very hypnotizable as we both know.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about how one can gauge their hypnotize ability.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Stage hypnosis was interesting.</p>
<p>This was in college, you know,</p>
<p>they brought someone out to the dormitory</p>
<p>and I recall being one of the people that was selected</p>
<p>and engaging in very bizarre behavior, right?</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t thoroughly embarrassing,</p>
<p>but it was pretty embarrassing.</p>
<p>And then being sent off the stage.</p>
<p>And as I was exiting, suddenly screaming something out</p>
<p>because he had planted a suggestion of some sort.</p>
<p>And then I was told to look in my pocket</p>
<p>and there was like a, I think a torn up dollar bill.</p>
<p>There were a bunch of things</p>
<p>that I have vague recollection of,</p>
<p>but it raises a set of questions</p>
<p>that really boil down to, you know,</p>
<p>as a biologist, I always think that, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no events in the brain, they&rsquo;re processes.</p>
<p>And so hypnosis, we know has an induction.</p>
<p>Then one is hypnotized, I imagine.</p>
<p>And then it sounds like this woman</p>
<p>and this example of the bird</p>
<p>and being distraught in New York City</p>
<p>is a failure to exit the hypnotic state.</p>
<p>Do we know what sorts of brain areas are active</p>
<p>during the induction, the, let&rsquo;s call it the deep hypnosis,</p>
<p>and then what&rsquo;s shutting off</p>
<p>or changing as people exit hypnosis?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, we do.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve studied that, we&rsquo;ve been very interested in that.</p>
<p>And so we did a study where we selected highly</p>
<p>and non-hypnotizable people so we could do the comparison</p>
<p>and then hypnotize them in the functional MRI scanner.</p>
<p>And we found three things characterize the entry</p>
<p>into the hypnotic state.</p>
<p>The first is turning down activity</p>
<p>in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex.</p>
<p>So the DACC is in the central front middle part</p>
<p>of the brain, as you well know.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s part of what we call the salience network.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a conflict detector.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re engaged in work and you hear a loud noise</p>
<p>that you think might be a gunshot,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s your anterior cingulate cortex saying,</p>
<p>hey, wait a minute, there&rsquo;s a potential danger over there,</p>
<p>you better pay attention to it.</p>
<p>So it compares what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>with what else is going on</p>
<p>and helps you decide what to do.</p>
<p>And as you can imagine,</p>
<p>turning down activity in that region</p>
<p>make it less likely that you&rsquo;ll be distracted</p>
<p>and pulled out of whatever you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>And in another study,</p>
<p>we found that highly hypnotizable people,</p>
<p>even without being hypnotized,</p>
<p>have more functional connectivity between the DACC,</p>
<p>the anterior cingulate cortex,</p>
<p>and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>So which is part of a key region</p>
<p>in the executive control network.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re engaging in tasks,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re enacting a plan, you&rsquo;re writing a paper,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing whatever you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the prefrontal cortex is doing that.</p>
<p>And so if that is coordinated,</p>
<p>we found more functional connectivity.</p>
<p>So when one is up, the other&rsquo;s up,</p>
<p>when one is down, the other&rsquo;s down.</p>
<p>That coordination implies that the brain is saying,</p>
<p>okay, go ahead, I know what you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>carry out that plan</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t worry about other possibilities.</p>
<p>So two other things happen when people are hypnotized.</p>
<p>One is that that DLPFC</p>
<p>has higher functional connectivity with the insula.</p>
<p>Another part of the salience network,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a part of the mind-body control system</p>
<p>sensitive to what&rsquo;s happening in the body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of the pain network as well.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also a region of the brain</p>
<p>where you can control things in your body</p>
<p>that you wouldn&rsquo;t think you could.</p>
<p>For example, we did a study years ago</p>
<p>where we took people who were highly hypnotizable,</p>
<p>hypnotized them and told them to,</p>
<p>we went on an imaginary culinary tour.</p>
<p>So they would eat their favorite foods.</p>
<p>And we found that they increased</p>
<p>their gastric acid secretion like by 87%.</p>
<p>So their stomach was acting as though it was about to get,</p>
<p>I mean, there was one woman,</p>
<p>it was so vivid for her that halfway through,</p>
<p>she said, let&rsquo;s stop, I&rsquo;m full.</p>
<p>You know, eating these imaginary-</p>
<p>Having never eaten any actual food.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>And then we got them to relax</p>
<p>and think of anything but food or drink.</p>
<p>And we got like a 40% decrease in gastric acid secretion.</p>
<p>So they could, and that was DLPFC through the insula</p>
<p>telling the stomach you&rsquo;re getting food</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re not getting food.</p>
<p>And even we injected them with pentagastrin,</p>
<p>which triggers gastric acid release.</p>
<p>And even then in the hypnosis condition,</p>
<p>they had a 19% reduction in gastric acid.</p>
<p>So the brain has this amazing ability</p>
<p>to control what&rsquo;s going on in the body</p>
<p>in ways that we don&rsquo;t think we have ability to control.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just one example.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the DLPFC insula connection.</p>
<p>The third thing that happens,</p>
<p>and this relates to what you did on the stage,</p>
<p>is you have inverse functional connectivity</p>
<p>between the DLPFC and the posterior cingulate cortex.</p>
<p>The posterior cingulate is part</p>
<p>of the default mode network.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the back of the brain.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an area whose activity goes down,</p>
<p>for example, in meditators.</p>
<p>And in meditation, you&rsquo;re supposed to be selfless.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re supposed to-</p>
<p>The self is an illusion.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re supposed to let it dissolve</p>
<p>and just experience things.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re doing that,</p>
<p>the posterior cingulate is decreasing in activity.</p>
<p>The inverse connection is I&rsquo;m doing something,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not thinking about what it means for me.</p>
<p>I may not even remember much of it.</p>
<p>If I do, I don&rsquo;t care that much about it.</p>
<p>And so that is part of the dissociation</p>
<p>that occurs with hypnosis.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s how you put things outside of conscious awareness</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t worry about what it means.</p>
<p>It also adds to cognitive flexibility.</p>
<p>You know, if you&rsquo;re thinking,</p>
<p>well, people like me don&rsquo;t usually do this,</p>
<p>that may inhibit you</p>
<p>from enacting a new form of psychotherapy, for example,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve never done before.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re having this decreased activity</p>
<p>in the part of your brain that reflects on what it means,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re more likely to be cognitively flexible</p>
<p>and willing to give it a try.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the therapeutic advantages</p>
<p>of hypnosis as well.</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to put, I&rsquo;m going to embarrass you here</p>
<p>a little bit in a positive sense.</p>
<p>Your laboratory is really the one that&rsquo;s pioneered</p>
<p>brain imaging of hypnotic states.</p>
<p>And it sounds like that&rsquo;s my understanding.</p>
<p>Is that correct?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, there are other people</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve done excellent research too,</p>
<p>but Pierre Rainville in Montreal and several other people,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re one of the leading labs</p>
<p>in neuroimaging of hypnosis.</p>
<p>I have to ask about attention deficit</p>
<p>hyperactivity disorder.</p>
<p>I get a lot of questions about this.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of people just struggle</p>
<p>with holding attention nowadays</p>
<p>because of interference with phones and devices.</p>
<p>And of course there is a lot</p>
<p>of clinically legitimate ADHD out there,</p>
<p>but the way that you describe</p>
<p>the dorsal interior cingulate and the salience network</p>
<p>and this conflict detector of,</p>
<p>am I focusing on something or am I splitting my attention?</p>
<p>How distractible am I seems to relate to some extent</p>
<p>to activity in the dorsal interior cingulate cortex.</p>
<p>Do people with ADHD display disruptions</p>
<p>in elements of these networks?</p>
<p>And has hypnosis ever been used to,</p>
<p>or self-hypnosis I should be to distinguish</p>
<p>from stage hypnosis,</p>
<p>clinical and self-hypnosis has been used</p>
<p>to enhance people&rsquo;s ability to focus and hold attention</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s such a built-in component</p>
<p>of the hypnotic state.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s sort of two ways to think about it.</p>
<p>In terms of enhancing focus, yes.</p>
<p>It has been very helpful in teaching people</p>
<p>to just prepare your mind to narrow in</p>
<p>and focus on something.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re really engaged in reading something</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re writing, I mean, I&rsquo;ll have that.</p>
<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;m thinking, oh God,</p>
<p>I have to do this for another hour.</p>
<p>Other times an hour will go by and I&rsquo;ll think, hey, great.</p>
<p>Because when you&rsquo;re in it, it feels game-like to you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just assembling the parts of the puzzle</p>
<p>and putting them together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>You just get absorbed.</p>
<p>For me, that&rsquo;s a hypnotic-like experience.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m having trouble, when I&rsquo;m struggling,</p>
<p>sometimes doing things like self-hypnosis can help.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert on ADHD.</p>
<p>My impression is that you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>that these are people who are constantly distracted</p>
<p>and rather rigid.</p>
<p>The other part of it is they&rsquo;re easily distractible.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very upset when they get distracted.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re rather rigid in what they want to attend to</p>
<p>and what they can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I think as a way of controlling</p>
<p>this distractibility, frankly.</p>
<p>My guess is that many people with ADHD</p>
<p>would not be that hypnotizable, but I haven&rsquo;t studied it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s possible that for some people with that disorder,</p>
<p>training in self-hypnosis might help,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;d have to see how hypnotizable they were</p>
<p>and take it from there.</p>
<p>I want to return to some of the underlying neural networks</p>
<p>and the clinical applications,</p>
<p>but what sorts of things, aside from the asthma,</p>
<p>have you used hypnosis successfully for,</p>
<p>or have others used clinical hypnosis for?</p>
<p>And are there any particular areas of psychiatric challenges</p>
<p>or illnesses, I guess they&rsquo;re called,</p>
<p>that are particularly amenable to hypnotic treatment?</p>
<p>Yes, there are.</p>
<p>Hypnosis is very good as a problem-focused treatment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, it&rsquo;s the oldest Western conception</p>
<p>of a psychotherapy, and it can be used</p>
<p>for specific problems in a way that&rsquo;s very helpful.</p>
<p>We found it very helpful for stress reduction,</p>
<p>for helping people deal,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all dealing with stress these days.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s helpful, that mind-body connection is very helpful</p>
<p>because part of the problem with stress is your perception.</p>
<p>You mentioned it earlier in a sort of good sense.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re at a football game or something</p>
<p>and you feel the physical reaction.</p>
<p>That can be a reinforcing thing.</p>
<p>Wow, this is exciting, let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>It can also be very distracting.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re worried about getting COVID</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re worried about some other physical problem</p>
<p>you have, and you notice it in your body.</p>
<p>Your body tenses up, you start to sweat,</p>
<p>the sympathetic nervous system goes,</p>
<p>your heart rate goes up.</p>
<p>And when you notice that, you think,</p>
<p>oh God, this is really bad.</p>
<p>And then you feel worse.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like a snowball rolling downhill.</p>
<p>And then you feel worse and then your body gets worse.</p>
<p>Hypnosis can be very helpful</p>
<p>in dissociating somatic reaction</p>
<p>from psychological reaction.</p>
<p>So we teach people to imagine their body floating</p>
<p>somewhere safe and comfortable, like a bath, a lake,</p>
<p>a hot tub, or floating in space.</p>
<p>And then picture the problem that&rsquo;s stressing them</p>
<p>on an imaginary screen with a rule</p>
<p>that no matter what you see on the screen,</p>
<p>you keep your body comfortable.</p>
<p>So at this point, you still can&rsquo;t control the stress,</p>
<p>but you can control your physical reaction to it.</p>
<p>And that starts you feeling more in control.</p>
<p>At least there&rsquo;s one thing I can manage.</p>
<p>And then you can use it to think through</p>
<p>or visualize through one thing you might do</p>
<p>about that stressor.</p>
<p>So hypnosis is very helpful in controlling</p>
<p>mind-body interaction in relation to stress.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very helpful for people to get to sleep.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re having a lot of fun with that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting emails from people who said,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t slept right in 15 years.</p>
<p>And now for the first time,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m listening to your app and I can sleep at night.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very helpful.</p>
<p>And again, if you wake up in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>I tell people, don&rsquo;t look at the clock,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an arousal cue, you&rsquo;ll wake up more.</p>
<p>But picture whatever you&rsquo;re thinking about</p>
<p>or worrying about on that imaginary screen</p>
<p>while your body&rsquo;s floating.</p>
<p>So watch your own movie, but keep your body floating.</p>
<p>And many people can use that to get back to sleep.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using the self-hypnosis for sleep for a long time</p>
<p>and now the Reverie app, and we&rsquo;ll talk about</p>
<p>our relationship to the Reverie app and its uses.</p>
<p>I find it incredibly useful for falling back asleep</p>
<p>in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>And it raises a question I&rsquo;ve found,</p>
<p>and I think I understand this correctly,</p>
<p>that one can do self-hypnosis during the daytime.</p>
<p>And then if there&rsquo;s an issue that comes up later,</p>
<p>like so for instance, do self-hypnosis for stress reduction</p>
<p>away from the stressful event to prepare one</p>
<p>to deal with stress better.</p>
<p>Or do hypnosis for improving the return to sleep.</p>
<p>And that can be done when you actually want to go to sleep,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a kind of a training up of these networks.</p>
<p>So is there evidence that these brain networks</p>
<p>actually form stronger connections</p>
<p>when people do self-hypnosis over time?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a rule in neurobiology, as you know,</p>
<p>that neurons that fire together, wire together.</p>
<p>My friend Carla Schatz, not Donald Hebb, by the way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a widespread myth in the world</p>
<p>that is unfortunately all over the internet,</p>
<p>which is that the word fire together, wire together</p>
<p>was said by the psychologist, Donald Hebb.</p>
<p>Donald Hebb did many important things,</p>
<p>but it is the neurobiologist Carla Schatz.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>Yes, is at Stanford, but was also at Berkeley and Harvard.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s also decent schools.</p>
<p>But is at Stanford who said fire together, wire together.</p>
<p>And so she deserves the credit for that statement.</p>
<p>Yeah, so with repeated use of self-hypnosis,</p>
<p>one could imagine that these networks are getting stronger.</p>
<p>I would think so.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have evidence of that yet,</p>
<p>but long-term potentiation provides a pathway,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve described them on your program a number of times</p>
<p>that allow for repeated activation of a network</p>
<p>to actually build new connections that work.</p>
<p>And at the least, even from a learning</p>
<p>and memory point of view,</p>
<p>memory is all a network of associations.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we remember things.</p>
<p>And the example I&rsquo;d like to give</p>
<p>is you go back to your grade school</p>
<p>and you see these little tiny lockers</p>
<p>and the size is all wrong,</p>
<p>and you suddenly have a flood of memories</p>
<p>that were obviously stored there,</p>
<p>but you just didn&rsquo;t think of.</p>
<p>So context and association is what memory is about.</p>
<p>If you start to acquire memories about a problem,</p>
<p>so one thing we use hypnosis for</p>
<p>is treating phobias, for example.</p>
<p>And the problem with people who have phobias,</p>
<p>like airplane phobias or crossing a bridge</p>
<p>or being up high, is that the more they avoid it,</p>
<p>the more the only source of associations and memories</p>
<p>is their fear.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have any good experiences with it</p>
<p>because they avoid it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like get back on the horse</p>
<p>after you fall off kind of thing.</p>
<p>And with hypnosis, if you can start people</p>
<p>able to manage their anxiety enough</p>
<p>that they can have more, a wider array of experiences,</p>
<p>they start to have a network of associations</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t so negative and may even be positive.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost like a, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>but I have to ask, it&rsquo;s almost like a exposure therapy</p>
<p>done in the mind.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, it&rsquo;s always in the mind.</p>
<p>I mean, even exposure to, if I have a snake phobia,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t like snakes,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think it qualifies as a full-blown phobia.</p>
<p>I think I have a healthy fear of snakes.</p>
<p>But if, let&rsquo;s say I had a snake phobia,</p>
<p>the typical approach would be,</p>
<p>cognitive behavioral approaches, right,</p>
<p>would be to show a picture of a snake</p>
<p>or then a rubber snake, then a real snake,</p>
<p>and eventually the person is holding a boa constrictor</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all in the mind</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s all translated into nervous system signals.</p>
<p>But with hypnosis, it sounds like you can give</p>
<p>a number of positive experiences</p>
<p>without having to use any props,</p>
<p>without having to bring any animals into the room,</p>
<p>drive someone across the bridge.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Yes. I had a woman who was a very successful businesswoman,</p>
<p>high level in a corporation.</p>
<p>I had a terrible dog phobia.</p>
<p>And so I had her imagine that somebody brought in a dog</p>
<p>to the room and I said, what are you doing?</p>
<p>And you could see her getting tense.</p>
<p>And she said, well, I&rsquo;m waiting to see what the dog does.</p>
<p>And I said, if somebody who works for you</p>
<p>comes into your office,</p>
<p>would you freeze and wait to see what they did?</p>
<p>And she said, of course not.</p>
<p>And I tell him what to do.</p>
<p>And I said, well, so you&rsquo;re immobilizing yourself.</p>
<p>The power isn&rsquo;t with the dog, it&rsquo;s with you.</p>
<p>So imagine what you might do to engage the dog</p>
<p>and help control the situation.</p>
<p>And she said, thanks.</p>
<p>And this reminds me of one of my favorite stories</p>
<p>about hypnosis that my father was seeing a woman</p>
<p>who lived in Midtown Manhattan and had a horrible dog phobia.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d drop things, she&rsquo;d spill coffee.</p>
<p>She would time her trips to the store</p>
<p>when she thought it was least likely</p>
<p>that people would be walking dogs.</p>
<p>Now that wouldn&rsquo;t be possible.</p>
<p>Everyone, it&rsquo;s like a fleet of French bulldogs</p>
<p>taking over New York City.</p>
<p>So he taught her to think of dog as a friend,</p>
<p>have a neighbor who had a dog, bring the dog over,</p>
<p>but hold the dog by the collar and make sure.</p>
<p>And gradually she was able to stroke the dog</p>
<p>and say, dog friend.</p>
<p>And distinguish between wild and tame animals.</p>
<p>There are animals you should be afraid of.</p>
<p>So she seemed to be doing better.</p>
<p>He called back about three months later and asked for her</p>
<p>and said, well, who&rsquo;s calling this on set?</p>
<p>And he said, Dr. Spiegel.</p>
<p>And the boy said, that&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>And my father said, what&rsquo;s weird?</p>
<p>He said, Spiegel&rsquo;s in heat.</p>
<p>She had bought a dog.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>And named it Spiegel.</p>
<p>Talk about transference.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>But it really speaks to the power of this.</p>
<p>And it brings me back to this issue</p>
<p>so what is different about what your father did in that case</p>
<p>with this woman in terms of what happened in hypnosis</p>
<p>that allowed her to go from being completely terrified</p>
<p>of dogs to owning a dog and naming it after your father,</p>
<p>which I find amusing,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s different than just the two of them sitting down</p>
<p>and talking about it, right?</p>
<p>In therapy, narrative is a huge component</p>
<p>and in hypnosis, narrative is a huge component.</p>
<p>So it must be that the brain state</p>
<p>is what is really different</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ll talk about trauma in a few minutes,</p>
<p>but I think people who have trauma or phobias</p>
<p>certainly could have a conversation about it.</p>
<p>Some of them might freeze up,</p>
<p>some of them might lose their articulation and so forth,</p>
<p>but what is different about that state</p>
<p>that combines with narrative</p>
<p>you think to allow these underlying neural networks</p>
<p>to engage or to change?</p>
<p>Because I find this so fascinating</p>
<p>because every attempt at dealing with stress or phobia</p>
<p>in the clinical setting</p>
<p>involves some discussion about what it is.</p>
<p>But here we&rsquo;re not talking about any medication</p>
<p>being introduced,</p>
<p>at least not in these particular circumstances.</p>
<p>So I realize it&rsquo;s kind of an obvious question,</p>
<p>like it has to be some difference in brain activity,</p>
<p>but I find that to be incredible.</p>
<p>The control variable there is the brain state.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s spoken.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re raising a couple of very important issues, Andrew.</p>
<p>We talked earlier about systematic desensitization</p>
<p>where you sort of lay out a hierarchy of things</p>
<p>and do it one at a time.</p>
<p>I think of this as unsystematic desensitization</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re changing mental states.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s more and more evidence</p>
<p>that mental state change itself has therapeutic potential.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing that with ketamine,</p>
<p>treating depression, a dissociagenic drug.</p>
<p>We see it, we know it every morning</p>
<p>when we wake up that problem.</p>
<p>You made the mistake of reading a nasty email at 11 p.m.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>You wake up in the morning, you think, oh, that idiot.</p>
<p>Yeah, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m gonna do.</p>
<p>So just changing mental state,</p>
<p>itself has therapeutic potential.</p>
<p>And I think we underestimate our ability</p>
<p>to regulate and change responses,</p>
<p>to be cognitively, emotionally, and somatically flexible.</p>
<p>And so we do things, you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>that follow similar principles of facing a problem,</p>
<p>seeing it from a different point of view.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve done a really nice podcast</p>
<p>on trauma and stress and how you have to expose yourself</p>
<p>to it, not avoid it, as we talked about before,</p>
<p>and then find some way to reconnect to it,</p>
<p>to substitute something that can make you feel good</p>
<p>rather than bad, so that you activate</p>
<p>other centers of the brain, like mesolimbic reward system.</p>
<p>And so I do that with hypnosis,</p>
<p>and you can do it much faster.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t think they can, but they can.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re having, right now, that physical experience,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking about this,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not feeling as bad as I used to,</p>
<p>that can be a powerful thing,</p>
<p>and you can do it with hypnosis.</p>
<p>A woman came to see me who had suffered an attempted rape,</p>
<p>it was getting dark, she was coming back</p>
<p>from the grocery store, and this guy grabs her</p>
<p>and wants to get her up into her apartment,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s outside her apartment,</p>
<p>and she starts fighting with him,</p>
<p>and she winds up with a basilar skull fracture.</p>
<p>He runs away, the cops come,</p>
<p>since she hadn&rsquo;t been raped, they left,</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t interested, and she wanted to use hypnosis</p>
<p>to get a better image of what this guy looked like,</p>
<p>which is a painful, upsetting thing.</p>
<p>She was quite hypnotizable, I got her floating,</p>
<p>I say, you&rsquo;re safe and comfortable now,</p>
<p>nothing can happen that will harm your body,</p>
<p>but on the left side of the screen,</p>
<p>I want you to picture this guy</p>
<p>and his approaching and what&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>and she said, the light, it was getting dark,</p>
<p>I really can&rsquo;t see much of his facial features,</p>
<p>but I do recognize something I hadn&rsquo;t allowed myself</p>
<p>to remember, if he gets me upstairs,</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t just want to rape me, he&rsquo;s going to kill me.</p>
<p>And so, in some ways, what she was seeing was even worse,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re thinking, good, Spiegel,</p>
<p>you made her even more frightened than she was before,</p>
<p>but as you had pointed out in your PTSD stress lecture,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to confront the trauma</p>
<p>to restructure your understanding of it.</p>
<p>So, on the other side of the screen, I had her picture,</p>
<p>what are you doing to protect yourself?</p>
<p>And everybody in a trauma situation</p>
<p>engages in some strategy of self-protection,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the salience network kicking in,</p>
<p>and she said, you know what,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s surprised that I&rsquo;m fighting that hard,</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t think I would.</p>
<p>And so, she realized, on the one hand,</p>
<p>that it was even worse than she thought it was,</p>
<p>but on the other hand,</p>
<p>that she actually probably saved her life.</p>
<p>And so, it was a way of helping her restructure</p>
<p>her experience of the trauma and make it more tolerable.</p>
<p>So, that helped with her, she didn&rsquo;t recognize,</p>
<p>she couldn&rsquo;t identify the guy,</p>
<p>but it helped her restructure</p>
<p>and understand her experience.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that you can do</p>
<p>in just talking straight out psychotherapy,</p>
<p>but sometimes you can do it a hell of a lot faster</p>
<p>and more efficiently using hypnosis.</p>
<p>And there is one randomized trial out of Israel</p>
<p>that shows that adding hypnosis to PTSD treatment</p>
<p>actually improves outcome.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s a way of accomplishing things</p>
<p>that we understand in the broader psychotherapy world,</p>
<p>but much more quickly and sometimes effectively.</p>
<p>Yeah, it sounds like going somewhat into the state</p>
<p>that one is trying to deal with,</p>
<p>but then dissociating from that state is key.</p>
<p>And I can imagine,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been open about this on various podcasts,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a lot of analysis over the years.</p>
<p>So, but I&rsquo;ve experienced myself that in those sessions,</p>
<p>depending on how I show up to them,</p>
<p>I might just get in kind of a laundry list of what happened</p>
<p>as opposed to actually feeling anything</p>
<p>around what happened.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I think people probably vary in the extent</p>
<p>to which they can drop into feeling states</p>
<p>and it can depend on the day.</p>
<p>It can depend on how well you slept the night before</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one thing I might add, Andrew,</p>
<p>and that is, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a notion of the late Gordon Bauer.</p>
<p>We just had a memorial for Gordon at Stanford.</p>
<p>He died about a year ago.</p>
<p>Brilliant cognitive psychologist,</p>
<p>one of the founders of cognitive psychology at Stanford.</p>
<p>And a great pitcher.</p>
<p>He almost became a major league pitcher,</p>
<p>but he decided to go to grad school instead.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m glad he did.</p>
<p>But Gordon helped establish the concept</p>
<p>of state-dependent memory.</p>
<p>That when you&rsquo;re in a certain mental state,</p>
<p>you enhance your ability to remember things about it.</p>
<p>And the sort of the bad example of that</p>
<p>is the drunk who hides the bottle</p>
<p>and can&rsquo;t remember where he put it</p>
<p>until he gets drunk again.</p>
<p>That he&rsquo;s in that same mental state.</p>
<p>People go into dissociative states</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re traumatized.</p>
<p>So in a way, hypnosis is helping them remember</p>
<p>and deal with the memories better</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re more in the mental state</p>
<p>that is more like what happened.</p>
<p>And most rape victims will tell you,</p>
<p>I was floating above my body,</p>
<p>feeling sorry for the woman being assaulted below.</p>
<p>People in traumatic episodes,</p>
<p>they just say, you know, I blank out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on autopilot.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a kind of self-hypnotic state.</p>
<p>So when you use hypnosis</p>
<p>to help them deal with a traumatic memory,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making the state they&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>right there in your office with you</p>
<p>more congruent to the state they were likely in</p>
<p>when the trauma happened.</p>
<p>And I think that is part of what helps facilitate</p>
<p>treatment of trauma-related disorders.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>So that makes me have to ask every question I have to ask</p>
<p>because I really feel it as almost a compulsion.</p>
<p>Then if dissociation during a traumatic episode</p>
<p>is part of the adaptive strategy,</p>
<p>but it creates certain issues,</p>
<p>it creates problems, right?</p>
<p>Why would something like ketamine,</p>
<p>which creates a dissociative state,</p>
<p>be useful for the treatment of trauma?</p>
<p>This is what I&rsquo;m confused about these days</p>
<p>because our colleague, Karl Deisseroth,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s also been on this podcast</p>
<p>and his coworkers have figured out,</p>
<p>okay, there&rsquo;s these layer one networks in the neocortex</p>
<p>and those are involved in dissociative state.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re starting to gain some understanding</p>
<p>of how ketamine works at a neural level.</p>
<p>It does seem as if for certain populations,</p>
<p>it can be a useful treatment.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;ve never tried it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the current status of that is,</p>
<p>but it is legal.</p>
<p>It is allowed, at least it&rsquo;s FDA approved and it&rsquo;s in use.</p>
<p>Why would dissociative states be useful</p>
<p>if some element of dissociation is what gave rise</p>
<p>to the trauma memory in the first place?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, Karl had a brilliant paper in Nature</p>
<p>where it was from rats to humans in one paper.</p>
<p>And he showed that there&rsquo;s this rhythmic discharge</p>
<p>in the retrosplenial region that is associated,</p>
<p>that is triggered by ketamine.</p>
<p>And the rats actually showed dissociative-like behavior</p>
<p>in that they would touch a hot pad</p>
<p>that they ordinarily wouldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t seem to have much pain in their paw.</p>
<p>And he then had a male subject who had implanted electrodes.</p>
<p>Human.</p>
<p>A human subject, yeah.</p>
<p>Human subject.</p>
<p>And the electrodes had picked up this rhythmic activity.</p>
<p>And when they did,</p>
<p>he would report being in a dissociative state.</p>
<p>And his description was,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like being the pilot of an airplane.</p>
<p>And then I felt myself walking out of the cockpit</p>
<p>and the plane was still flying.</p>
<p>It sounds terrifying to me.</p>
<p>It sounds terrifying.</p>
<p>I want to be in my body most of the time, you know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But the point is, in a way,</p>
<p>the principle, Andrew, is like the principle you said,</p>
<p>that you need to re-confront a traumatic situation</p>
<p>before you can modulate your associations to it.</p>
<p>So you have to accept it, accept the arousal,</p>
<p>put some boundaries around it,</p>
<p>and then figure out how you can approach that problem,</p>
<p>or how you did approach that problem</p>
<p>from a different point of view.</p>
<p>So it does not surprise,</p>
<p>in fact, we&rsquo;ve studied people who dissociated</p>
<p>during the Loma Prieta earthquake</p>
<p>and the Oakland-Berkeley firestorm.</p>
<p>I remember both of those well.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Earthquakes follow me.</p>
<p>The Northridge earthquake.</p>
<p>The South and then the Northridge quake, yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to keep-</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;ll be one later this afternoon.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to dissociate, Andrew.</p>
<p>So dissociation does compartmentalize experience,</p>
<p>but that means from the point of view of treating trauma,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an inhibition.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t engage it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it happened over there.</p>
<p>And I think what happens is that people</p>
<p>are sometimes too good at being able</p>
<p>to separate themselves from the recollection.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s in there somewhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s out of sight, but it&rsquo;s not out of mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s having effects on you, but you can&rsquo;t deal with it.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t reprocess it.</p>
<p>So I do think one reason ketamine might work</p>
<p>is that, in fact, it allows you to keep,</p>
<p>to re-approach the dissociative experience</p>
<p>in a way that you can then start to think about</p>
<p>and do something about it.</p>
<p>And just the fact you can turn it on and off.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also where self-hypnosis is so helpful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something that just comes over you</p>
<p>and happens to you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something you can make happen.</p>
<p>You can control it.</p>
<p>You can do something with it.</p>
<p>So you feel less helpless and out of control.</p>
<p>The essence of trauma is helplessness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not fear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not pain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s helplessness.</p>
<p>You become an object.</p>
<p>You become just your body.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t control what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not used to that.</p>
<p>You and I have discussed this brilliant paper</p>
<p>on anticipation of breathing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not whether you breathe, inhale, or exhale,</p>
<p>or hold your breath.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that if you think you can inhale and you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>that is really upsetting, understandably.</p>
<p>And so the issue is control.</p>
<p>And hypnosis, which has this terrible reputation</p>
<p>of taking away control,</p>
<p>is actually a superb way of enhancing your control</p>
<p>over mind and body.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>And it reminds me that naming is so important.</p>
<p>You almost wonder if self-hypnosis and clinical hypnosis</p>
<p>had been called something else,</p>
<p>that it would have been separated out from stage hypnosis</p>
<p>in a way that would make it less scary, weird,</p>
<p>complicated for people to embrace.</p>
<p>But part of the reason for having this discussion</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;ve had great experiences with hypnosis.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the data.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about a lot of clinical examples.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredibly powerful,</p>
<p>and it boils right down to neural brain states.</p>
<p>And I think in the years to come,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to become more widespread.</p>
<p>Along those lines, how quickly,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve described some examples</p>
<p>of people getting relief very quickly.</p>
<p>How permanent are those changes?</p>
<p>Is there a need for follow-up?</p>
<p>And related to that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure a number of people are listening to this</p>
<p>and thinking, wonderful, I&rsquo;d love to get hypnotized</p>
<p>for any number of different things by Dr. Spiegel</p>
<p>or somebody else expert in clinical hypnosis,</p>
<p>but they might not have access to you</p>
<p>or somebody with similar training.</p>
<p>So what is the power?</p>
<p>So how quickly does it work?</p>
<p>How long lasting are those changes?</p>
<p>And then is it necessary to work with a clinical hypnotist?</p>
<p>And is it better to do that than self-hypnosis</p>
<p>and so on and so forth?</p>
<p>Maybe you could just give us a contour of the landscape</p>
<p>of directed and self-directed treatment.</p>
<p>Well, typically, most people start</p>
<p>by coming to see a clinician like me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better to see someone who has licensing</p>
<p>and training in their professional discipline,</p>
<p>medicine, psychology, dentistry, whatever.</p>
<p>Because there are a lot of hypnotists out there</p>
<p>who are just hypnotists.</p>
<p>Just hypnotists.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And the key issue is somebody who can really assess</p>
<p>what your problem is and make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not talking someone</p>
<p>into reducing their chest pain</p>
<p>rather than getting their coronary artery problem.</p>
<p>Because they could have a real issue there.</p>
<p>They could, right.</p>
<p>That hypnosis might adjust,</p>
<p>but wouldn&rsquo;t deal with the deeper underlying issue.</p>
<p>On the other hand, and typically when I use it with people,</p>
<p>I often only see them once or twice or periodically,</p>
<p>but not every week.</p>
<p>And certainly not every day if they have a pain problem.</p>
<p>And hypnosis is very helpful for pain.</p>
<p>And so what I&rsquo;m doing is identifying</p>
<p>how hypnotizable they are.</p>
<p>I give them a standard brief test</p>
<p>of their ability to experience hypnosis.</p>
<p>And then going through a self-hypnosis exercise with them</p>
<p>to deal with the problem, seeing how they respond to it.</p>
<p>And then teaching them how to do it for themselves.</p>
<p>And in the old days, I used to have them use their iPhone</p>
<p>and record that part of the session</p>
<p>so they could play back the hypnosis experience.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ve developed an app, Reverie,</p>
<p>that can teach people and step them through</p>
<p>dealing with pain, stress, focus, insomnia,</p>
<p>and help people eat better and stop smoking.</p>
<p>And we have elements that take about 15 minutes</p>
<p>and elements that just take one or two minutes</p>
<p>that people can refresh and reinforce.</p>
<p>So the idea-</p>
<p>Two minute hypnosis.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one to two minutes now.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re finding that two thirds of the people</p>
<p>find that even just the one minute refresher</p>
<p>helps them feel better.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re reporting they feel better.</p>
<p>So the nice thing is you know right away</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s likely to help you or not.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve done studies looking at hypnosis</p>
<p>for pain relief in acute medical procedures.</p>
<p>We did a randomized trial that we published in The Lancet.</p>
<p>Three conditions, people getting arterial cutdowns</p>
<p>to chemoembolized tumors in the liver</p>
<p>or visualized renal artery stenosis.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t use general anesthesia for this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very uncomfortable and people are anxious.</p>
<p>And we had three conditions.</p>
<p>One was standard care.</p>
<p>They could push a button and get opioids, IV.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s during the surgery.</p>
<p>During the surgery.</p>
<p>The second is they could do that</p>
<p>plus they had a friendly nurse comforting them.</p>
<p>So we controlled for pleasant attention and support.</p>
<p>And the third was we taught them self-hypnosis</p>
<p>for pain control.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re feeling, you can change the temperature.</p>
<p>Your body is cool, tingling and numb.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re floating in ice water and feeling comfortable.</p>
<p>Or go somewhere else.</p>
<p>Leave your body here and go to a desert island</p>
<p>and enjoy yourself.</p>
<p>And we found that it&rsquo;s about two and a half hour procedure</p>
<p>that by an hour and a half,</p>
<p>the hypnosis group had reduced their pain by 80%</p>
<p>compared to the standard care group</p>
<p>using half the amount of opioids.</p>
<p>They had fewer complications</p>
<p>and the procedure took 17 minutes less time on average</p>
<p>to get done because not only was the patient more relaxed,</p>
<p>so was the treatment staff.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t dealing with someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s struggling and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>We measured their anxiety and same thing.</p>
<p>The hypnosis group, I was worried they were all dead.</p>
<p>They had no anxiety after an hour and a half.</p>
<p>They were saying, I&rsquo;m fine.</p>
<p>And they were fine.</p>
<p>And the standard care group</p>
<p>had five out of 10 anxiety scores at that point.</p>
<p>So we published that in the Lancet, big randomized trial.</p>
<p>If we had a drug that did that,</p>
<p>every hospital in the country would be using it now.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no industry to push it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s part of what helped us decide</p>
<p>that we needed to help people do this with reverie</p>
<p>and teach them how to do it</p>
<p>and provide interactive support for them to do it.</p>
<p>And the question, although, is does it work long-term?</p>
<p>Because what we can do acutely doesn&rsquo;t necessarily carry on.</p>
<p>So we did a randomized trial of women</p>
<p>with metastatic breast cancer.</p>
<p>They had advancing disease.</p>
<p>We met with them in a support group once a week</p>
<p>and taught them self-hypnosis for stress and anxiety</p>
<p>and pain control at the end.</p>
<p>And by the end of a year,</p>
<p>the treatment group had half the pain</p>
<p>the control group did on the same</p>
<p>and very low amounts of medication.</p>
<p>So it lasts.</p>
<p>And they would say, when I felt that pain in my chest</p>
<p>and thought it was a metastasis, I just did the exercise.</p>
<p>I got myself in a warm bath and I felt fine.</p>
<p>So it works because it becomes a skill that people acquire.</p>
<p>But they can tell right away</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s likely to help them working with a clinician</p>
<p>or now using the app or other ways</p>
<p>of helping them learn to use it as a skill.</p>
<p>So the nice thing is you will know very quickly</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s likely to help you or not.</p>
<p>And if it is, you can learn to do it for yourself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And we will, again, there&rsquo;ll be a link to Reverie</p>
<p>in the caption, it&rsquo;s available for Apple and Android.</p>
<p>And I think even though there&rsquo;s a nominal cost there,</p>
<p>I think that, as you mentioned,</p>
<p>medications and other approaches</p>
<p>to dealing with these problems are quite expensive</p>
<p>and have all the potential for side effects</p>
<p>and things, not that some of those aren&rsquo;t also useful.</p>
<p>Could I, before you get to that, just one thing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve worked very hard on the app.</p>
<p>We have an iOS app for Apple.</p>
<p>We decided to table for a moment, redoing the Android app.</p>
<p>So it was available when we were working</p>
<p>through the Alexa platform.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not at the moment, but it will be soon.</p>
<p>So I just don&rsquo;t want people to be disappointed</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re looking for it for Android.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on our agenda, but we don&rsquo;t have it at the moment.</p>
<p>Great, thanks for that clarification.</p>
<p>So hopefully in time for both.</p>
<p>I get asked a lot about obsessive thoughts</p>
<p>or intrusive thoughts.</p>
<p>I also get asked a lot about OCD.</p>
<p>Is there any evidence that hypnosis or self-hypnosis</p>
<p>can be used for dealing with obsessive thoughts?</p>
<p>Sometimes.</p>
<p>There are some very obsessional people</p>
<p>who just turn out not to be that hypnotizable,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not random.</p>
<p>They tend to be so over-controlling of thought.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all busy evaluating rather than experiencing.</p>
<p>So in some ways.</p>
<p>I know a few people like that.</p>
<p>I mean, you do too.</p>
<p>It sounds like an adaptive mindset</p>
<p>for a lot of professions and areas,</p>
<p>and that we get trained up in that during school,</p>
<p>how to obsess over the exam,</p>
<p>obsess over our social interactions.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s part of becoming a functional human being,</p>
<p>and yet you can take us down a different path.</p>
<p>We sometimes overdo it.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ll tell you one example from extreme situations,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re judging, evaluating.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not letting yourself experience,</p>
<p>including emotionally.</p>
<p>I know somebody who listens to the tapes</p>
<p>from airplanes that go down.</p>
<p>So they get the black box and they listen to it.</p>
<p>And he said to me-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s his profession, or he does this recreationally?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s his profession.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he did.</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re trying to do accident prevention</p>
<p>and how to handle things.</p>
<p>And he said that you worry about people panicking, right?</p>
<p>And here, these guys know that they&rsquo;ve got 30 seconds</p>
<p>or some 45 seconds,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just going through their checklist.</p>
<p>He said, they don&rsquo;t panic enough.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re taught that this is what you do,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s good reason for it,</p>
<p>but sometimes they overdo it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s painful to listen to this</p>
<p>because you know what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of a balance we have to hit.</p>
<p>Sometimes we get too emotional and too absorbed,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not with it enough</p>
<p>to sort of see other possibilities.</p>
<p>That can be a problem.</p>
<p>But on the other hand,</p>
<p>sometimes you&rsquo;re too rigid and controlled,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t let your emotions guide you</p>
<p>to what you need to do to protect yourself</p>
<p>or protect others.</p>
<p>So I would say in general that people with OCD</p>
<p>are on the less hypnotizable side of the spectrum.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re less likely to allow themselves</p>
<p>to engage in anything.</p>
<p>And the typical example is the checking with OCD,</p>
<p>for example.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t remember whether they locked the door</p>
<p>or turned off the gas in the oven,</p>
<p>and they keep going back and they keep checking.</p>
<p>So there, the evaluative component of the brain</p>
<p>kind of overrides the experiential one.</p>
<p>And sometimes people can get some benefit,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not a group that I would select</p>
<p>for being the most likely to respond</p>
<p>to self-hypnotic approaches.</p>
<p>Are superstitions similar?</p>
<p>Superstitions, I think that&rsquo;s more.</p>
<p>There are people who are very hypnotizable</p>
<p>who keep getting caught up in things like superstitions.</p>
<p>And there, the imagination supplants the reality.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve seen a lot of that happening recently.</p>
<p>And so I think there,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible that they could be helped</p>
<p>by learning to sort of see it,</p>
<p>but put it in context,</p>
<p>see it from a different point of view.</p>
<p>I developed a pretty vicious superstition</p>
<p>when I was in college, and it was hard to break, actually.</p>
<p>I always feel that when I talk to clinicians,</p>
<p>I have to reveal certain things about my own pathology.</p>
<p>And so-</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll get my bill later.</p>
<p>Thank you, yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of the reason I arranged this, John.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>But yeah, I did.</p>
<p>I had a habit of knocking on wood for things,</p>
<p>and I noticed it started to,</p>
<p>I would sneak knocking on wood every once in a while</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t want people to think</p>
<p>I was doing too often.</p>
<p>And then I started to realize</p>
<p>that it was becoming a little bit of a reflex.</p>
<p>And then I saw this incredible video</p>
<p>from Ben Siedlewski&rsquo;s lab at Harvard.</p>
<p>He studies motor patterns.</p>
<p>He has these rats that press different sequences</p>
<p>of levers and turn dials in order to get a pellet of food.</p>
<p>But that as they do that,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll start to introduce these behaviors</p>
<p>that have nothing to do with the actual lever pressing.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;ll start scratching their hindquarters</p>
<p>and things like that,</p>
<p>and their head, excuse me,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t wear hats,</p>
<p>and flipping their ears.</p>
<p>And this is just like a pitcher</p>
<p>before throwing a baseball.</p>
<p>That we do this,</p>
<p>we start to incorporate motor behaviors</p>
<p>that are unrelated to the outcome,</p>
<p>but our mind somehow starts to think</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re necessary for the outcome.</p>
<p>And so then you incorporate it.</p>
<p>So I decided to break it by simply forcing myself</p>
<p>to not do it for about a week.</p>
<p>And then it just seemed like a ridiculous thing to do.</p>
<p>Yeah, well-</p>
<p>Knock on wood.</p>
<p>We call that response prevention,</p>
<p>and it works.</p>
<p>Because what you do is,</p>
<p>you set up a new context in your brain</p>
<p>where you get the outcome you want,</p>
<p>devoid of the extraneous behavior.</p>
<p>And I knew it was nuts, right?</p>
<p>I knew it was illogical,</p>
<p>but somehow these things take on meaning.</p>
<p>So we talked about the utility of hypnosis</p>
<p>for stress reduction, phobias, pain,</p>
<p>possibly, we don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but for things like ADHD and OCD,</p>
<p>it just will depend on hypnotizability.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You talked about this beautiful study</p>
<p>on the breast cancer outcome or patients.</p>
<p>Hypnotizability is clearly a key variable.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So could you please tell us what hypnotizability is,</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s evaluated,</p>
<p>and what the Spiegel-Eyeroll test is?</p>
<p>Okay, sure.</p>
<p>So hypnotizability is just a capacity</p>
<p>to have hypnotic experiences.</p>
<p>And we have a test called the hypnotic induction profile,</p>
<p>where we give a highly structured hypnotic experience.</p>
<p>And the old tradition in clinical hypnosis</p>
<p>was that you try a bunch of different things,</p>
<p>talking, walking upstairs and downstairs,</p>
<p>and other images,</p>
<p>and time what you say to the breathing</p>
<p>of the subject and all that.</p>
<p>And the more you change what you do as a clinician,</p>
<p>the less you can make a variation in outcome.</p>
<p>So, and it could take a long time,</p>
<p>you know, 20 minutes, 30 minutes.</p>
<p>And I just view that as a kind of complex,</p>
<p>not very effective way of assessing</p>
<p>the person&rsquo;s hypnotic capacity.</p>
<p>We know that the peak period of hypnotizability</p>
<p>in the human life is the latency years in childhood.</p>
<p>So every eight-year-old is in a trance all the time.</p>
<p>You know, you call them in for dinner,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t hear you, they&rsquo;re doing their thing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why childhood is such a wonderful experience.</p>
<p>Work and play are all the same thing, you know?</p>
<p>And we try to make them into little adults,</p>
<p>which I think is a terrible mistake.</p>
<p>They, everything is fun for them.</p>
<p>They enjoy learning, they enjoy everything.</p>
<p>So what age are they in this process?</p>
<p>This is like six to 10, six to 11.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re playful, they enjoy everything.</p>
<p>Everything is sort of a game and fun.</p>
<p>And we try to make it miserable for them,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve got it.</p>
<p>And then when what Piaget called, you know,</p>
<p>a more adult cognitive framework</p>
<p>where we learn abstract concepts.</p>
<p>We learn that even if one bottle looks bigger</p>
<p>than the other, they can have equal volume.</p>
<p>And so we start imposing logic.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re growing our DLPFC at that point</p>
<p>and imposing cognitive structure on experience.</p>
<p>Some people start to lose that hypnotic ability.</p>
<p>By the time you&rsquo;re in your early twenties,</p>
<p>your hypnotizability becomes extremely fixed.</p>
<p>And there was a study done at Stanford.</p>
<p>Ernest Hilgarth, Phil Zimbardo did this looking at,</p>
<p>they tracked down students who were in psych one,</p>
<p>had their hypnotizability measured</p>
<p>and retested them blindly 25 years later.</p>
<p>And the test retest correlation was,</p>
<p>you want to guess what it was?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know, 0.6 something.</p>
<p>Yeah, very close.</p>
<p>It was 0.7, IQ would be 0.6 on a 25 year interval.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s more stable than IQ over a 25 year interval.</p>
<p>So once you&rsquo;re at that point, that&rsquo;s where you are.</p>
<p>What are the factors that lead to that?</p>
<p>Well, and so what it means is that about a third</p>
<p>of adults are just not hypnotizable.</p>
<p>Two thirds are, about 15% are extremely hypnotizable.</p>
<p>And we can measure that and give it a number from zero to 10</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s very useful.</p>
<p>For some of my patients, when I do it, I say, look,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, you&rsquo;re not hypnotized,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re going to do something else.</p>
<p>Medication, systematic desensitization,</p>
<p>mindfulness, other things.</p>
<p>Or if they&rsquo;re very hypnotizable, I just go for it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do a lot of explaining.</p>
<p>People who are low to moderate hypnotizable</p>
<p>like explanations about what you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>but then they can still get the benefits.</p>
<p>So it helps me guide the nature of my treatment</p>
<p>with these people.</p>
<p>Now, the eye roll is, my father used to use</p>
<p>an eye fixation induction.</p>
<p>He used to say, look up at the ceiling</p>
<p>and now close your eyes while you&rsquo;re looking up.</p>
<p>Oh, you&rsquo;re very, yes, you&rsquo;re very good.</p>
<p>He noticed he had two patients back to back.</p>
<p>And one was a woman who I&rsquo;d seen him work with</p>
<p>who had hysterical seizures.</p>
<p>She would just suddenly start shaking and-</p>
<p>Real epileptic seizures.</p>
<p>No, pseudo epileptic seizures.</p>
<p>I see, so hysteria.</p>
<p>Hysteria, and although some people have both,</p>
<p>that is the, for some people,</p>
<p>real epilepsy becomes a framework</p>
<p>that gets elaborated on for when you&rsquo;re stressed,</p>
<p>you have seizures.</p>
<p>She just had pseudo epilepsy, no EEG abnormalities.</p>
<p>And she, it was really something to watch.</p>
<p>Her husband had to move his workbench near the door</p>
<p>so that if she started to have a seizure,</p>
<p>he could run home and try and help her with it.</p>
<p>It was that bad.</p>
<p>And he noticed that when she, when she did what you did,</p>
<p>when she looked up, when she would have</p>
<p>one of her seizure events, all you see is sclera.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see iris anymore.</p>
<p>And she would start to see.</p>
<p>So he, he did a great thing with her.</p>
<p>He taught her to have seizures.</p>
<p>Everybody else was telling her to stop.</p>
<p>He made her have one.</p>
<p>So he hypnotized her and let&rsquo;s go back</p>
<p>to the last time you had one.</p>
<p>And sure enough, she&rsquo;d start to shake.</p>
<p>And gradually he&rsquo;d make them smaller and smaller.</p>
<p>So she was learning, she could control, she&rsquo;d have access.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like with PTSD, you know, you confront,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t avoid it, you don&rsquo;t suppress it.</p>
<p>You confront it and figure out how to deal with it.</p>
<p>The next patient he had was a rigid,</p>
<p>obsessional businessman who wanted to stop, you know,</p>
<p>being so controlling and all this.</p>
<p>It reminded me, there was a New Yorker cartoon</p>
<p>of a driver who comes to a yield sign and he yells, never.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s always being controlled.</p>
<p>Sounds about right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a New Yorker.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m a New Yorker.</p>
<p>And so this guy, when he tried to look up,</p>
<p>he couldn&rsquo;t keep his eyes up while he closed them.</p>
<p>And so my father started testing people.</p>
<p>And it seemed that there is a rough correlation</p>
<p>between the capacity to keep your eyes up</p>
<p>while you close them and measured hypnotize ability.</p>
<p>So that people who are listening and watching on video.</p>
<p>So the Spiegel eye roll test involves looking up</p>
<p>at the ceiling.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s tilting the head back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tilting my chin back and looking up at the ceiling now,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m also directing my eyes upward and my eyes are open.</p>
<p>And then the eye roll test involves then closing</p>
<p>the eyelids while the eyes are open.</p>
<p>And whether or not the eyes roll back.</p>
<p>And as you said, then you see sclera, the white part.</p>
<p>That means you&rsquo;re very hypnotizable</p>
<p>or moderately hypnotizable.</p>
<p>Whereas if the eyes move down and you see iris,</p>
<p>the colored part of the eye, as the eyes close,</p>
<p>less hypnotized.</p>
<p>And you can look this up online there.</p>
<p>You just put Spiegel eye roll test and you&rsquo;ll find it.</p>
<p>And we are also going to do an actual example</p>
<p>of hypnosis on video later.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re asking the brain to do something difficult</p>
<p>to keep the eyes up while closing the eyelids.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s contradictory signals for the third, fourth</p>
<p>and sixth cranial nerve nuclei that control eye movement.</p>
<p>You said the third?</p>
<p>Fourth and sixth cranial nerve nuclei.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re suspending one activity while asking them</p>
<p>to do another.</p>
<p>And eye movements have a lot to do</p>
<p>with levels of consciousness.</p>
<p>You know, the periaqueductal gray</p>
<p>surrounds these cranial nerve nuclei.</p>
<p>And when we, you know, we close our eyes when we sleep,</p>
<p>we have rapid eye movement when we dream.</p>
<p>Most drugs that affect level of consciousness</p>
<p>can affect eyes and eye movements,</p>
<p>either the dilation or contraction of the pupils,</p>
<p>depending on whether it&rsquo;s a stimulant or an opioid.</p>
<p>Stimulants make the pupils big.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah, this like cocaine, amphetamine.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>Things of that sort.</p>
<p>And opioids, you get constricted pupils.</p>
<p>This is what parents, you know,</p>
<p>parents looking at their kids coming in the door</p>
<p>late at night, they&rsquo;re looking for substance abuse.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something about the eyes</p>
<p>that has a lot to do with level of consciousness.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously you close your eyes when you go to sleep,</p>
<p>you have rapid eye movement when you&rsquo;re dreaming.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not surprising.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an old Zen practice</p>
<p>called looking at the third eye.</p>
<p>And I think part of the reason that this happens</p>
<p>is where you&rsquo;re looking up inside.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a third eye</p>
<p>between the other two in your forehead.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re visual creatures.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re pretty pathetic</p>
<p>from a physical point of view.</p>
<p>You know, many animals can outrun us, you know,</p>
<p>or outsmell us, or see, you know,</p>
<p>eagles could read newsprint at a hundred yards</p>
<p>and we can&rsquo;t, you know, it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So our major defensive sensory input is vision.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why, you know, animals, predator animals</p>
<p>have eyes in the front of their head</p>
<p>so that they have very good detailed vision of prey.</p>
<p>Whereas prey animals like deer</p>
<p>have eyes on the side of their head.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t see things that well,</p>
<p>but they have a much bigger range</p>
<p>of potential to see threat.</p>
<p>And we mainly use, and in fact, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ve been social anthropologists that say,</p>
<p>why do we gather where we do, you know, on coastlines</p>
<p>and, you know, at the edge of a forest or something?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;ve got protection in the back.</p>
<p>Something can attack you from one side</p>
<p>and you have a big vision of what might threaten you.</p>
<p>And we tend to like be attracted</p>
<p>to those kinds of physical situations.</p>
<p>So. And we love vistas.</p>
<p>We love vistas.</p>
<p>Vistas are very calming.</p>
<p>They take us into that panoramic vision.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know this, but it turns out</p>
<p>that most of the scenic spots at any location</p>
<p>in national parks were where people naturally aggregated.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t, which makes sense, you know,</p>
<p>but that those signs and locations</p>
<p>were built up around people&rsquo;s tendency</p>
<p>and animals&rsquo; tendencies to aggregate there.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s an interesting book</p>
<p>on the history of the national parks</p>
<p>that says that they didn&rsquo;t give a research study</p>
<p>to support it, but there was no Google Maps, obviously.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, panorama and visual boundaries</p>
<p>are really interesting.</p>
<p>I think, so the eyes, as we both know,</p>
<p>are two pieces of the central nervous system</p>
<p>of the brain outside the. Right, right.</p>
<p>I used to say that the eyes are outside the skull</p>
<p>and a neuro-ophthalmologist wrote to me</p>
<p>and vehemently pointed out</p>
<p>that they are outside the cranial vault.</p>
<p>So, you know, they&rsquo;re outside the cranial vault,</p>
<p>but they are two pieces of brain.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re out there.</p>
<p>And so you mentioned cranial nerves three, four, and six.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a neuroanatomy course,</p>
<p>but maybe we could go a little deeper there.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, you said there&rsquo;s contradictory activity.</p>
<p>Looking up is controlled by the one set of cranial nerves</p>
<p>and then the closing of the eyelids</p>
<p>is controlled by another cranial nerve.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s the same one.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s six, that when you close your eyes,</p>
<p>you activate, no, it&rsquo;s the facial.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s the facial nerve.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s seven, yeah. Seven, yeah.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re looking up, you&rsquo;re activating the muscles</p>
<p>that force your eyes to look up</p>
<p>and closing your eyelids normally relaxes those,</p>
<p>relaxes that upper movement because your eyes are closed</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t need to do it.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re breaking a usual customary pattern.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the rubbing, the, hey, I can&rsquo;t even do it.</p>
<p>See, it&rsquo;s like the, rubbing your tummy</p>
<p>and patting your head.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit, there&rsquo;s a bit of a conflict there.</p>
<p>But clinically, it&rsquo;s been a good probe for you</p>
<p>and for your father.</p>
<p>So was it Spiegel Sr. or Spiegel Jr.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Spiegel Sr.</p>
<p>That developed the Spiegel eye roll test.</p>
<p>But the key issue is this,</p>
<p>that normally when we close our eyes also,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to sleep.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not worried about what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>in the world anymore.</p>
<p>Here, you&rsquo;re maintaining resting alertness.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re focusing, but you&rsquo;re turning inward.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an unusual state.</p>
<p>Normally we don&rsquo;t, we close our eyes periodically.</p>
<p>We have to, but when you close your eyes</p>
<p>for some period of time, it&rsquo;s normally to go to sleep.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not worried about, you know,</p>
<p>detecting risk or threat.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an interesting state</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re turning inward, basically.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking up, you&rsquo;re shutting your eyes</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re allowing whatever happens outside you to happen</p>
<p>and focusing on what&rsquo;s going on inward.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a, I think it&rsquo;s a signal to your brain</p>
<p>to turn inward.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>And meditation, of course, could be done with eyes open,</p>
<p>but almost always it&rsquo;s done with eyes closed.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>So you can very quickly determine</p>
<p>whether or not someone is highly hypnotizable,</p>
<p>not at all hypnotized.</p>
<p>We see about two thirds of people can be hypnotized.</p>
<p>Obviously a third cannot,</p>
<p>but within the two thirds that can, there&rsquo;s a range.</p>
<p>And you said 15% of people fall into this</p>
<p>highly hypnotizable category</p>
<p>that I seem to be a member of.</p>
<p>And does repeated use of self-hypnosis</p>
<p>or clinical hypnosis increase or change hypnotizability</p>
<p>for those that can access it in the first place?</p>
<p>I would say in general, it may increase a little bit,</p>
<p>but not a hell of a lot.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not worth the effort</p>
<p>to increase your hypnotizability at that point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth trying to deal with the problem</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re dealing with.</p>
<p>So you can get better at using it at the level that you have.</p>
<p>There was a study done in which they tried to train people</p>
<p>to be more hypnotizable.</p>
<p>And obviously there are subjective</p>
<p>and behavioral components to the test.</p>
<p>You can learn to do a little better on them.</p>
<p>But what we found was when we reanalyzed this data</p>
<p>that we could account for three times the final score</p>
<p>based on the initial hypnotizability measurement</p>
<p>rather than whether or not</p>
<p>they had been trained to do better.</p>
<p>So you can improve it a little,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not worth the trouble.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Along the lines of eyes and eye movements,</p>
<p>a lot of interest out there about EMDR,</p>
<p>eye movement, desensitization, reprocessing.</p>
<p>Shapiro herself was working,</p>
<p>she wasn&rsquo;t at Stanford directly,</p>
<p>but was the local to Stanford, I think in Palo Alto.</p>
<p>So what are your thoughts on EMDR?</p>
<p>Where is it useful?</p>
<p>Where do you think it&rsquo;s less useful?</p>
<p>Are there things that EMDR could be combined with</p>
<p>to make it more useful?</p>
<p>The listeners of this podcast come to,</p>
<p>I think come to the podcast</p>
<p>with a range of backgrounds and interests.</p>
<p>To me, it makes sense why EMDR,</p>
<p>lateralized eye movements might work</p>
<p>given the newer data that it can suppress amygdala activity</p>
<p>in some animals and animal models and in humans as well.</p>
<p>But it really hasn&rsquo;t been explored much neurally.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard things like it coordinates</p>
<p>the two sides of the brain,</p>
<p>which to me is just a throwaway.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any evidence</p>
<p>that coordinating the two sides of the brain</p>
<p>is better than not coordinating.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be speaking right now</p>
<p>if the two sides of my brain were well correlated</p>
<p>because language is lateralized.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve heard that it mimics rapid eye movements</p>
<p>during sleep, but actually it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So, but I have heard people talk about</p>
<p>their positive experiences with EMDR.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about EMDR?</p>
<p>Yeah, you had a good comment on that</p>
<p>in one of your recent podcasts.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you, one way I sort of think about it</p>
<p>from a bemused point of view is the old,</p>
<p>you mentioned it earlier,</p>
<p>the oldest sort of idea of a hypnotic induction</p>
<p>was a dangling watch, right?</p>
<p>You know, and to watch.</p>
<p>And in fact, there was enough concern about it</p>
<p>that when automobiles were invented,</p>
<p>there was a movement to prevent</p>
<p>installing windshield wipers</p>
<p>because people were afraid that they would be hypnotized</p>
<p>if they watched the windshield wipers</p>
<p>go back and forth on a car.</p>
<p>Now it turns out, fortunately,</p>
<p>that you tend not to look at the windshield wipers.</p>
<p>You keep looking through the windshield.</p>
<p>And so we have windshield wipers today.</p>
<p>But that movement is what exactly</p>
<p>used to be a hypnotic induction.</p>
<p>I think there is a lot of hypnosis in EMDR.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s a combination of that</p>
<p>with exposure-based treatments</p>
<p>where you use EMDR to think about it.</p>
<p>You tend not to process the experience as much</p>
<p>and just do the physical part of it,</p>
<p>which I personally think is a drawback.</p>
<p>And every study I&rsquo;ve seen that was a dismantling study,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no question that people who go through EMDR,</p>
<p>many of them get better with trauma-related problems</p>
<p>and the VA has a big program using it and so on.</p>
<p>But every program that has dismantled</p>
<p>going through the treatment</p>
<p>with having the lateral eye movement</p>
<p>has shown that the lateral eye movement</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t add anything to it.</p>
<p>And toward the end of her career,</p>
<p>Francine was doing now contralateral touching or something.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t eye movements anymore.</p>
<p>It was other things.</p>
<p>So I tend to think that EMDR</p>
<p>is another form of exposure-based therapy for trauma.</p>
<p>But as you&rsquo;ve implied,</p>
<p>with the exception of this possible new data,</p>
<p>it certainly doesn&rsquo;t have to do</p>
<p>with rapid eye movement sleep.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think moving the eyes is the issue.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a way of sitting down and confronting trauma.</p>
<p>And I would rather that the trauma itself</p>
<p>be processed a bit more than often happens in EMDR.</p>
<p>So a lot of people have gotten therapy.</p>
<p>Some of them have been helped.</p>
<p>Francine used to originally claim</p>
<p>that just one session would desensitize people and do it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s clearly not true.</p>
<p>I see a lot of people who said,</p>
<p>yeah, it helped for a while, but I need more.</p>
<p>So I think it became a kind of</p>
<p>overly simplistic approach to understanding brain physiology</p>
<p>and that part is wrong.</p>
<p>And the interesting thing,</p>
<p>you mentioned suppressing amygdala activity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>My late friend, Alan Hobson,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a brilliant sleep researcher.</p>
<p>You know Alan.</p>
<p>Sleep researcher.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know him,</p>
<p>but I read his book when I was in college</p>
<p>about the chemistry of sleep</p>
<p>and the similarities between dream states and hallucinations.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of the reasons I got into this business.</p>
<p>Yes, well, I worked with him</p>
<p>in a MacArthur Mind-Body Network for many years.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a brilliant guy.</p>
<p>He points out that we need to get into</p>
<p>primarily a parasympathetic state to go to sleep,</p>
<p>that we have to shut off the sympathetic nervous system.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why a loud noise wakes you up</p>
<p>when your heart rate goes up and all this.</p>
<p>So he was brilliant at documenting</p>
<p>what happens in the brain in sleep.</p>
<p>He pointed out something also very interesting about dreams,</p>
<p>which is that the stories in dreams</p>
<p>and even the images in dreams</p>
<p>can change all over the place in crazy ways,</p>
<p>but usually the affect is constant.</p>
<p>So usually if it&rsquo;s a frustration dream,</p>
<p>whatever happens, you wind up frustrated.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s a, you know, enjoyment dream,</p>
<p>you enjoy whatever&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an odd consistency and affect in dreams</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t have in other states.</p>
<p>And the idea of lateral eye movement</p>
<p>suppressing amygdala activity would kind of fit with that,</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t allow intrusions</p>
<p>of fear and anger and upset in dreams.</p>
<p>It may be there all the time,</p>
<p>but it may not be there when you think it should be.</p>
<p>So why is it that you can be falling off a building</p>
<p>and somehow not that scared?</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re just having this experience</p>
<p>of flying in a dream.</p>
<p>So I think there may be something going on</p>
<p>about regulating affect,</p>
<p>but we have elaborate and better ways to regulate affect.</p>
<p>Great, so EMDR might incorporate some elements of hypnosis.</p>
<p>So the lateralized eye movements,</p>
<p>perhaps by way of suppressing the amygdala,</p>
<p>this fear-associated center might bring people</p>
<p>into a more parasympathetic calm state.</p>
<p>So it might be pseudo hypnosis and then exposure therapy</p>
<p>through the discussion about the issue.</p>
<p>Right. Okay.</p>
<p>More research needed on EMDR out there.</p>
<p>And obviously something that&rsquo;s come up a lot</p>
<p>in this discussion and in our discussions</p>
<p>that I have the great fortune of talking to you every week</p>
<p>is, and working together,</p>
<p>is this idea of getting close to the phobia,</p>
<p>getting close to the trauma,</p>
<p>re-experiencing it as a portal</p>
<p>to then adjusting the response to it</p>
<p>and rewiring something.</p>
<p>So the troubling thing or the horrible thing</p>
<p>is no longer as horrible to us.</p>
<p>But the repeating theme is we can&rsquo;t expect</p>
<p>to get over something without getting really close to it,</p>
<p>maybe even experiencing it somatically.</p>
<p>Nowadays, we hear a lot about triggers and trigger warnings,</p>
<p>and certainly one can understand why those exist.</p>
<p>But it seems like there&rsquo;s a, in the general population,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this idea that we want to move away</p>
<p>from anything that upsets us.</p>
<p>And yet I think it&rsquo;s fair to say,</p>
<p>even though I haven&rsquo;t gathered the statistics,</p>
<p>that on the whole, that the human beings</p>
<p>are becoming more and more anxious</p>
<p>and more and more stressed.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of, but certainly in parallel</p>
<p>with the fact that we&rsquo;re trying to move away</p>
<p>from troubling things, troubling things.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve heard you say before</p>
<p>that in terms of therapeutic approaches,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just about the state you get into,</p>
<p>but whether or not you brought yourself there voluntarily.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>So this element of deliberate self-exposure,</p>
<p>deciding I&rsquo;m going to confront the trauma,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to confront the pain,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to confront the insomnia,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to confront the, you know, and fill in the blank.</p>
<p>And then readjusting one&rsquo;s emotional response</p>
<p>right up next to that troubling thing.</p>
<p>That seems to be the hallmark of this treatment.</p>
<p>And if I&rsquo;m thinking about it correctly,</p>
<p>of pretty much all treatments for getting over stuff,</p>
<p>if people don&rsquo;t have access</p>
<p>to a really good clinician like yourself,</p>
<p>how should they carry these thoughts and these ideas?</p>
<p>I mean, I think almost everybody of any reasonable age</p>
<p>has memories or things that upset them,</p>
<p>but we learn to suppress them.</p>
<p>What does one do?</p>
<p>Obviously the Reverie app has approaches</p>
<p>to dealing with some of this inside of the app,</p>
<p>but how does one start to think about</p>
<p>actually dealing with something like this</p>
<p>and avoiding the hazards of just kind of reactivating</p>
<p>a lot of painful experiences?</p>
<p>Because a lot of being a functional human being</p>
<p>is also going to work each day,</p>
<p>interacting with people and not bringing one&rsquo;s trauma,</p>
<p>you know, and dumping it out all on the table</p>
<p>or being able to just function is so crucial.</p>
<p>So how do you think about this as a clinician?</p>
<p>Well, you know, the image that comes to mind</p>
<p>is the Greek myth of Pandora&rsquo;s box,</p>
<p>you know, that it opened and the furies got out</p>
<p>and you couldn&rsquo;t put them back in.</p>
<p>And we have this kind of fantasy</p>
<p>that once you get into these memories,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll take you over</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll never get them back in the box.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>You know, we, people who use hypnosis say that</p>
<p>there are ways to present things to people</p>
<p>that will be helpful in ways that won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And one real mistake is to tell someone,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think about purple elephants.</p>
<p>You know, what are you thinking about?</p>
<p>You know, it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>So you want to find a way to feel in control of the access</p>
<p>and to define what happened on your own terms.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m not a big fan of trigger warnings.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re going crazy over, you know,</p>
<p>this could be upsetting.</p>
<p>That could be upsetting.</p>
<p>Yeah, there are lots of things that are upsetting.</p>
<p>You know, the average kid has watched 20,000 murders</p>
<p>by the time he&rsquo;s 20 years old,</p>
<p>watching television and movies these days.</p>
<p>So, you know, we see terrible things.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not a matter of,</p>
<p>are you exposed to something that&rsquo;s upsetting,</p>
<p>but how do you handle it?</p>
<p>What do you make of it?</p>
<p>And are you feeling in control?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like, you know,</p>
<p>what Putin is doing to his rival in Russia,</p>
<p>you know, forcing him to watch propaganda movies</p>
<p>for 10 hours a day while he&rsquo;s in prison.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a matter of thinking about a problem</p>
<p>in a way that leaves you feeling you understand it better.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in more control.</p>
<p>You can turn it off when you want.</p>
<p>You can turn it on when you want.</p>
<p>And so we have to, in life, deal with stressful things.</p>
<p>There are studies, Karen Parker at Stanford</p>
<p>has done some wonderful studies with primates</p>
<p>about stress inoculation,</p>
<p>that if you separate a baby monkey from his mother</p>
<p>for two hours a day and then reunite them,</p>
<p>and then you stress that baby monkey later,</p>
<p>they actually handle stress better.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s less cortisol arousal in the face of the stress.</p>
<p>Stress inoculation, it&rsquo;s been called.</p>
<p>So mere exposure to trauma or stress,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a part of living anyway.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t avoid it even if we&rsquo;d like to.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not pleasant, it&rsquo;s not great,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s sometimes things you need to learn about life.</p>
<p>And if you can find an algorithm for facing it,</p>
<p>putting it into perspective, dealing with it,</p>
<p>you become a stronger person, not a weaker person.</p>
<p>So this idea that college students are such fragile flowers</p>
<p>that if you talk about a sexual assault or something,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;re doing something terrible to them,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just wrong.</p>
<p>And I think we need to build our ability</p>
<p>to recognize and manage stress.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t do that without doing it.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t learn, or you can&rsquo;t ride a bicycle</p>
<p>without taking the risk of falling off it, you know?</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s the way I think</p>
<p>of dealing with stress.</p>
<p>Yeah, I really appreciate you saying that.</p>
<p>You and I were both at a gathering, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>where this issue was being discussed</p>
<p>and around an issue of a publicized sexual trauma,</p>
<p>and you made an excellent case</p>
<p>for why this stuff can&rsquo;t be pushed under the rug.</p>
<p>And that actually, in my observation,</p>
<p>led to a lot of healing for the people that,</p>
<p>and the families of people that suffered from this.</p>
<p>I do think people are resilient,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t really teach how to think about feelings.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re told that we need to feel our feelings,</p>
<p>but then again, we are also told that feelings</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t hold all the information.</p>
<p>And so I think that, as you mentioned,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no operating or user&rsquo;s manual</p>
<p>for this nervous system thing.</p>
<p>Brings me to another issue,</p>
<p>which is the mind-body connection,</p>
<p>something that we&rsquo;re very interested in</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve done extensive work on.</p>
<p>We all like to think that getting more in touch</p>
<p>with our body would be a great thing,</p>
<p>learning to intercept,</p>
<p>paying attention to our internal landscape</p>
<p>would be a great thing.</p>
<p>But as we often discuss, when we&rsquo;re feeling lousy,</p>
<p>then being really in touch with that lousy feeling</p>
<p>may or may not be a good thing, right?</p>
<p>So how should we think about mind-body?</p>
<p>I can see examples in hypnosis,</p>
<p>from your descriptions of hypnosis,</p>
<p>where you want to unify the mind-body connection,</p>
<p>feel what you&rsquo;re thinking,</p>
<p>think what you&rsquo;re feeling, et cetera.</p>
<p>But I could also point to elements</p>
<p>within the hypnotic process</p>
<p>in which you are actively trying to uncouple those.</p>
<p>So it sounds to me like this whole mind-body thing</p>
<p>is a bit more like a car.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t say that 40 miles per hour is the optimal speed.</p>
<p>It kind of depends on the road you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>and the turn you may or may not be taking.</p>
<p>How should we think about mind-body</p>
<p>in terms of navigating daily life?</p>
<p>What do you think is the adaptive way</p>
<p>to conceptualize the mind-body?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big question.</p>
<p>It is, it&rsquo;s a very interesting one.</p>
<p>I guess I think that it&rsquo;s a matter</p>
<p>not of absolute control, but more control,</p>
<p>that we need to think of our brain as a tool</p>
<p>and our body signals as tools as well</p>
<p>to help us understand what&rsquo;s going on in the world,</p>
<p>what matters, what&rsquo;s important,</p>
<p>what isn&rsquo;t, but also something that can be managed,</p>
<p>not simply absorbed.</p>
<p>And so hypnosis, I think, is a kind of limiting case</p>
<p>where you can push it about as far as we can push it</p>
<p>in terms of regulating pain.</p>
<p>Pain is a good example of that.</p>
<p>Obviously, you need to pay attention.</p>
<p>If you just broke your ankle,</p>
<p>you better pay attention to it and get help,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re having crushing substernal chest pain,</p>
<p>you better do something about it.</p>
<p>But our brain is sort of programmed</p>
<p>to treat all pain signals</p>
<p>as if they were novel pain signals,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a sudden new problem that needs to be attended to.</p>
<p>I teach people to think of the pain and categorize it.</p>
<p>See, does the pain mean that if you put weight on this,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to re-injure your ankle, for example,</p>
<p>or does it simply mean that your body is healing</p>
<p>and the pain is a sign that gradually</p>
<p>things are getting back to normal?</p>
<p>So you can modify the way you process pain</p>
<p>based on what your brain tells you the pain means.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s true for emotional pain as well,</p>
<p>and particularly where I think a strategy that really helps</p>
<p>is if you think of an interpersonal problem</p>
<p>or a threat of something coming as an opportunity</p>
<p>to do something to ameliorate the situation.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just it&rsquo;s happening to you,</p>
<p>but something that you can influence</p>
<p>and do something about.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s blending the receptive with the active response</p>
<p>that I think can make a difference.</p>
<p>So you try and process it in a way</p>
<p>that gives you a deeper understanding of what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>You face it, but you also say,</p>
<p>this is an opportunity for me to do something about it.</p>
<p>And the minute you realistically enhance,</p>
<p>and this doesn&rsquo;t mean imagine away a heart attack,</p>
<p>it means figure out how to rehabilitate</p>
<p>from a heart attack or a broken leg or something like that</p>
<p>in a way that you get as much control</p>
<p>into the situation as you can.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Grief.</p>
<p>Grief is one of those states that is very hard</p>
<p>to remove oneself from.</p>
<p>And a lot of people ask me, how do I deal with grief?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not a clinician, so I&rsquo;m deferring to you.</p>
<p>Actually, someone at Stanford recently</p>
<p>came to me and said, my mother passed away</p>
<p>and I had a sibling that passed away</p>
<p>and they were the only people that I had.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m also living alone</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m challenged with a number of things.</p>
<p>And they looked like they were holding it together</p>
<p>very well, in fact, given what they were describing.</p>
<p>And on the one hand,</p>
<p>well, I certainly point out that I&rsquo;m not a clinician,</p>
<p>but I said, on the one hand,</p>
<p>you could imagine that it would be necessary</p>
<p>and useful to go into the grief state</p>
<p>if you want to transition through it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I&rsquo;ve heard before</p>
<p>that the cathartic model of just really diving</p>
<p>into an emotion can also be potentially hazardous</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have any anchors to grab onto.</p>
<p>What is the view of psychiatry or your view of grief</p>
<p>and how to deal with grief?</p>
<p>Because I think grief is one of those all-encompassing</p>
<p>emotions for many people.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very important, natural, necessary stage of life</p>
<p>and the reason we have all these grief rituals,</p>
<p>from burials and memorials and headstones</p>
<p>and sitting Shiva and other things that people do,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a way of making it real,</p>
<p>that an incomprehensible loss has to be comprehended.</p>
<p>You have to realize that you&rsquo;re now gonna have to live life</p>
<p>without your loved one, your parent, your sibling, whoever.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve all gone through this at one time or another,</p>
<p>I certainly have.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very hard to just come to terms with,</p>
<p>but one principle is to sort of say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s never all or none, it&rsquo;s more or less.</p>
<p>So yes, it&rsquo;s all or none that you&rsquo;ve lost a loved one.</p>
<p>But I ask people as part of their grieving</p>
<p>to say to themselves,</p>
<p>and I do this in hypnosis sometimes too,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve lost them, but what have they left you with?</p>
<p>What have they bequeathed to you even though they&rsquo;re gone?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll sometimes ask them to say,</p>
<p>if your mother could be here right now,</p>
<p>what would she say to you?</p>
<p>How would she feel about your life now?</p>
<p>What would she advise you to do?</p>
<p>So in our support groups for women</p>
<p>with advanced breast cancer, we lost people.</p>
<p>And I gotta tell you that we were warned by oncologists</p>
<p>that we demoralize people that,</p>
<p>I mean, there were wonderful oncologists,</p>
<p>but there are some that were very afraid</p>
<p>that we would harm them in some way,</p>
<p>because the mortality rate is fairly high</p>
<p>with metastatic breast cancer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna watch people die of the same disease</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll demoralize them.</p>
<p>And so we actually measured their emotion</p>
<p>and the content of speech every five minutes</p>
<p>throughout a bunch of groups</p>
<p>to make sure that wasn&rsquo;t happening.</p>
<p>What we found was that they talked</p>
<p>about more serious issues,</p>
<p>but the mood didn&rsquo;t actually get worse.</p>
<p>And we found in general that expressing negative emotion</p>
<p>on the long run helps people be less anxious</p>
<p>and depressed over time.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve shown this in randomized clinical trials.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just my clinical impression.</p>
<p>And what we try to get them to do is to face a loss,</p>
<p>live with the emotion that comes with it,</p>
<p>but also see that the reason it hurts so much</p>
<p>is how much that person gave you.</p>
<p>So we would do a self-hypnosis exercise</p>
<p>at the end of the group and say,</p>
<p>I want you to get your body floating safe and comfortable.</p>
<p>Now picture Mary and sit with the feeling of sadness</p>
<p>that she&rsquo;s no longer with us.</p>
<p>And we do that for a few minutes.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;d say on the other side,</p>
<p>picture one thing she left with you that you still have,</p>
<p>that you carry on in your heart,</p>
<p>her tradition of what she gave to you.</p>
<p>And so just seeing it not as a complete loss,</p>
<p>but as a real loss, a painful loss,</p>
<p>but one that helps you to reflect on what you gained</p>
<p>from her and knowing her,</p>
<p>I think can be very helpful in the grieving process.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very helpful, the way to conceptualize it.</p>
<p>A couple of quick questions.</p>
<p>Can children be safely hypnotized or do self-hypnosis?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sometimes harder for them to do self-hypnosis.</p>
<p>They need more structure to do it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to share your dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>with them a little bit, but yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>Children can be very hypnotizable.</p>
<p>And I know pediatricians who use it wonderfully all the time.</p>
<p>They get them to focus on something else.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re going to have to give them a shot</p>
<p>or draw blood or something.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll say, I&rsquo;m going to press your happy button</p>
<p>and presses their belly button.</p>
<p>And they start to giggle the way kids do.</p>
<p>And meanwhile, the nurse is drawing the blood</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t even notice it.</p>
<p>Dentists, good dentists can use it to help kids</p>
<p>with fear and pain.</p>
<p>So yes, it can be very effective for children.</p>
<p>We did a randomized trial.</p>
<p>I have a publication in pediatrics.</p>
<p>My late sister, who was a pediatrician</p>
<p>and who always used to joke that she was the only one</p>
<p>in our family who was a real doctor, you know,</p>
<p>I said, I got you, I got a paper in pediatrics.</p>
<p>And the paper was children having to undergo</p>
<p>avoiding cystourethrograms.</p>
<p>So the anatomy of the kidney, if you&rsquo;ll forgive me,</p>
<p>is sort of interesting in that the ureter</p>
<p>that goes into the bladder normally goes into the bladder</p>
<p>at an angle.</p>
<p>And so that means that when the bladder contracts</p>
<p>to expel urine, it automatically closes off the ureter</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s sideways to the bladder.</p>
<p>Some kids are born with it perpendicular</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ll get reflux into the kidney.</p>
<p>And some children outgrow it.</p>
<p>Some need pretty complicated surgery to fix that.</p>
<p>And so you image them every year or so</p>
<p>to see whether they&rsquo;re getting kidney damage or not.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a pretty miserable experience.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a nine-year-old girl.</p>
<p>You have to go and lie on a hard, cold table,</p>
<p>have strangers pull your legs apart</p>
<p>and stick a catheter into your urethra</p>
<p>and hold in the bladder and then expel urine.</p>
<p>And so you get into these struggling fights.</p>
<p>And of course, the more they struggle,</p>
<p>the more they constrict and it makes it harder to do it.</p>
<p>So I was asked if we could test this.</p>
<p>So we did a randomized trial at Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</p>
<p>They either got training in self-hypnosis.</p>
<p>I would meet with them and the mother the week before.</p>
<p>We find out from the kids where they like to be.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d say, you&rsquo;re gonna play a trick on your doctors.</p>
<p>Your body&rsquo;s there, you&rsquo;re somewhere else.</p>
<p>Go visit your friend, go to Disneyland, do something else.</p>
<p>And the mother would work on this with me</p>
<p>at the head of the table.</p>
<p>And we found that these children were much easier to image.</p>
<p>One got so relaxed, he said, normally it takes us 10 minutes</p>
<p>to get them to pee after they&rsquo;re doing this.</p>
<p>She was so relaxed, she started peeing</p>
<p>before I could even get the bedpan under her</p>
<p>and I had to clean up the table.</p>
<p>And they also, 17 minutes shorter procedures.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a long 17 minutes for a little kid.</p>
<p>So it can be very effective with children.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re less anxious, they have less pain</p>
<p>and get through these difficult procedures very well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Has hypnosis ever been done for couples,</p>
<p>like couples therapy?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of pretty much every clinical setting here.</p>
<p>Both people have to be hypnotizable, of course.</p>
<p>But the reason I ask about this is,</p>
<p>next I&rsquo;m gonna ask about psychedelics</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of interest in coordinating states</p>
<p>through the use of drugs of different kinds.</p>
<p>We actually do this when we treat depression, right?</p>
<p>You have a depressed person with a family members</p>
<p>who are not depressed and you say,</p>
<p>well, let&rsquo;s make them all not depressed, right?</p>
<p>I mean, but in all, and I&rsquo;m only half kidding there</p>
<p>because that is kind of the underlying logic in some sense.</p>
<p>But are you aware of any coordinated hypnosis?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve done plenty of it in groups,</p>
<p>not with couples.</p>
<p>You can hypnotize large groups at once.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Are we hypnotized right now?</p>
<p>Yeah, you are.</p>
<p>And I hope you&rsquo;ve been enjoying it.</p>
<p>But the metastatic breast cancer,</p>
<p>there was a group of like 10 women</p>
<p>who would meet once a week</p>
<p>and we would all go into hypnosis together.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize that you were hypnotizing them collectively.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, right.</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p>And that, you know, if anything,</p>
<p>I think it brings out the best in people&rsquo;s abilities</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a shared social experience</p>
<p>and they would talk about it afterwards.</p>
<p>And so, yes, that&rsquo;s absolutely doable, yeah.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t wanna focus on psychedelics specifically.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s a topic for a future episode,</p>
<p>but is there any basis for combining hypnosis</p>
<p>with drug therapies inside of the hypnotic episode?</p>
<p>So I realize that some patients of yours</p>
<p>might be prescribed antidepressant</p>
<p>or a medication for some purpose,</p>
<p>maybe same or different</p>
<p>than the hypnosis is being directed toward.</p>
<p>But is there any evidence that if people are relaxed</p>
<p>through the use of a propranolol or some,</p>
<p>you know, one of these many things in the psychiatrist kit</p>
<p>that hypnosis can be more effective?</p>
<p>Well, interestingly, one study that I haven&rsquo;t mentioned</p>
<p>is we did spectroscopy on people who were hypnotized</p>
<p>and we found that there was a correlation</p>
<p>between hypnotized ability and GABA activity</p>
<p>in the anterior cingulate cortex,</p>
<p>which fits with turning down activity.</p>
<p>So to the extent that we can self-medicate</p>
<p>and GABA receptors basically are doing</p>
<p>what benzodiazepines do to the brain,</p>
<p>that can happen when people are hypnotized.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying inside of the hypnosis,</p>
<p>you have neural evidence</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a kind of a sedative effect of hypnosis</p>
<p>at the chemical level?</p>
<p>Yeah, right, right.</p>
<p>The people who are more hypnotizable</p>
<p>have more of those GABA receptors</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s related to the degree of their hypnotized ability.</p>
<p>In terms of, there have been studies</p>
<p>where they try to give people medications as well.</p>
<p>And the interesting thing with benzodiazepines,</p>
<p>which activate inhibitory activity in the brain,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re very anxious,</p>
<p>it might improve your hypnotic response a bit.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re just so anxious, you can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not very anxious,</p>
<p>it actually inhibits hypnotic activity</p>
<p>because you get sort of sedated and just out of it</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t focus your attention as well.</p>
<p>So by and large, we don&rsquo;t use drugs as an adjuvant</p>
<p>to hypnotic experience.</p>
<p>Most of the time, you don&rsquo;t need to,</p>
<p>and sometimes it can make it worse rather than better.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some evidence that mild stimulants</p>
<p>might enhance hypnotic responsiveness a little reliably,</p>
<p>but too much will again, scatter attention</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll have less control over it.</p>
<p>So they might be adjuvants,</p>
<p>but I frankly think hypnosis is more of a replacement</p>
<p>than a need of supplementation.</p>
<p>Your laboratory, my laboratory have,</p>
<p>well, sort of snuck into your lab</p>
<p>and then trying to kind of merge the two.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a lot of fun and learning a lot</p>
<p>about the power of respiration of breathing</p>
<p>to shift brain states,</p>
<p>not just during breathing protocols, but at all times.</p>
<p>And we will do an entire episode about those protocols.</p>
<p>I think after those are published and so on,</p>
<p>but breathing itself, as you&rsquo;ve described,</p>
<p>is a bridge between conscious and unconscious states.</p>
<p>And so I have to ask how important</p>
<p>is the patient&rsquo;s breathing pattern?</p>
<p>How closely are you monitoring their breathing pattern?</p>
<p>How closely do you monitor your own breathing pattern</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re inducing hypnosis?</p>
<p>Put simply, what is the role of respiration</p>
<p>in shifting the brain&rsquo;s state during a hypnotic protocol?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>You had a great show with Jack Feldman.</p>
<p>Yeah, Jack Feldman.</p>
<p>And he is, and the issue,</p>
<p>I watch it, I try it.</p>
<p>The work that we&rsquo;re enjoying doing together</p>
<p>shows that there are breathing patterns</p>
<p>that may increase sympathetic arousal or may decrease it,</p>
<p>may have been, you know,</p>
<p>cyclic sighing seems to actually where you have</p>
<p>more time spent exhaling than inhaling,</p>
<p>seem, and there&rsquo;s reason to believe</p>
<p>that it induces parasympathetic activity</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re increasing pressure in the chest</p>
<p>and therefore allowing the heart to slow down</p>
<p>because blood is being returned to the atrium more easily.</p>
<p>I do use it.</p>
<p>I ask people to take a deep breath</p>
<p>as part of the induction and then slowly exhale.</p>
<p>And partly as a result of our research together,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m emphasizing the slow exhale more</p>
<p>as part of, to enhance the idea in the induction</p>
<p>that this is a period of relaxation</p>
<p>because I think they are inducing that</p>
<p>and perhaps perceiving it as well.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no, you&rsquo;re absolutely right</p>
<p>that breathing is very interesting</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s right at the edge of conscious,</p>
<p>and Jack talked about that too,</p>
<p>of conscious and unconscious control,</p>
<p>that it will go on automatically, but we can control it.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a kind of way for us to demonstrate</p>
<p>to ourselves greater ways of modulating our internal state.</p>
<p>So you can either do it thinking about it</p>
<p>the way we do with pain control and hypnosis,</p>
<p>or you can do it to some extent</p>
<p>by taking charge of your breathing</p>
<p>and doing things that will produce a change</p>
<p>that you want to see happen in your body.</p>
<p>So I like it because it&rsquo;s right at that margin</p>
<p>where you can enhance.</p>
<p>For me, I like that as a way of augmenting hypnosis</p>
<p>more than medication.</p>
<p>I think this is a powerful way of doing that.</p>
<p>Great, I&rsquo;m really excited to see where all of this goes.</p>
<p>Breathing, vision, bodily states,</p>
<p>clearly the directed mental focus</p>
<p>seem to be the key elements of hypnosis.</p>
<p>Am I missing any other ingredients?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Breathing, vision.</p>
<p>Breathing, vision, how you change your vision.</p>
<p>And typically, you&rsquo;re in a physically relaxed state,</p>
<p>but frankly, there are people at the peak of performance,</p>
<p>including physical, athletic performance,</p>
<p>or musical performance,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re in hypnotic states too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to classical pianists who say,</p>
<p>if I start thinking about what my fingers are doing now,</p>
<p>I screw up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m floating above the piano thinking about the tone</p>
<p>that I want to feel exuding from the instrument.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a hypnotic-like state too.</p>
<p>And many athletes who are in peak performance</p>
<p>are just flowing with it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not thinking step-by-step, what am I doing?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re doing your best.</p>
<p>Or when we&rsquo;re working or giving a talk and doing it well,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in a hypnotic-like state.</p>
<p>So it usually requires,</p>
<p>but doesn&rsquo;t necessarily require physical comfort</p>
<p>or quietness.</p>
<p>It can sometimes be intense activity.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>Well, this has been an amazing discussion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned so much as I always do from you.</p>
<p>Where can people learn more</p>
<p>about how they can get hypnotized?</p>
<p>We mentioned Reverie.</p>
<p>We will put a link to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s reveri.com is the way to access that.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s the Reverie app from the App Store is the other way.</p>
<p>Reverie.com is the website.</p>
<p>You can get to it through that</p>
<p>or download the Reverie app from the App Store.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>So currently on Apple, hopefully soon also on Android.</p>
<p>But in the meantime,</p>
<p>what if people are interested</p>
<p>in exploring clinical hypnosis,</p>
<p>working with you or somebody similar?</p>
<p>Is there a centralized resource that people can go to</p>
<p>to find really well-trained hypnotists?</p>
<p>There are two good professional organizations</p>
<p>that will help you with that.</p>
<p>One is the Society for Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s sceh.us is their website.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll look it up and provide a link.</p>
<p>And the American Society for Clinical Hypnosis.</p>
<p>And they both provide referral services for professionals.</p>
<p>You can look it up.</p>
<p>I would just say in general,</p>
<p>look for someone who is licensed and trained</p>
<p>in their primary professional discipline,</p>
<p>psychiatry, psychology, medicine, dentistry,</p>
<p>and who has training and interest in using hypnosis</p>
<p>is a way to do it.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>And then one more question, and then a comment.</p>
<p>The question is, will you be my psychiatrist?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m honored, I&rsquo;m honored.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tall task.</p>
<p>I might be the most stubborn patient.</p>
<p>I think the hardest work&rsquo;s already been done, Andrew.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re fine now.</p>
<p>I appreciate that.</p>
<p>Well, and the final thing is a comment.</p>
<p>First of all, thank you so much for being here today,</p>
<p>for sharing your knowledge.</p>
<p>I hope we can do it again and again.</p>
<p>I hope so.</p>
<p>I love working with your laboratory and with you.</p>
<p>Likewise.</p>
<p>Because when you speak, I learn and I learn,</p>
<p>and I know others do as well.</p>
<p>We will put resources to get to you.</p>
<p>But I also just want to say thank you</p>
<p>for doing the work that you do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredible thing that in this world</p>
<p>where we are discovering so much about how the body works,</p>
<p>you know, the mind is still rather mysterious</p>
<p>and people are struggling with a lot of things.</p>
<p>But also I think people are really excited</p>
<p>about applying tools like hypnosis to perform better,</p>
<p>feel better mentally and physically.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;ve pointed us to a tremendous amount</p>
<p>of resources and how these tools work</p>
<p>and where they&rsquo;ve already been demonstrated to work.</p>
<p>So just thank you.</p>
<p>I know this is your life&rsquo;s professional commitment in life</p>
<p>and we all benefit.</p>
<p>So thank you so much.</p>
<p>Well, thank you.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s been a real joy for me</p>
<p>to be collaborating with you</p>
<p>and for you to be using your precision and knowledge</p>
<p>about neuroanatomy, neurobiology to address problems</p>
<p>that often people who are that disciplined</p>
<p>in the primary neurobiological end</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t as interested in as you are.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s really been a pleasure to try and, you know,</p>
<p>bring together what we both know</p>
<p>from these different perspectives</p>
<p>to build something that neither of us could do alone.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s been a real joy for me to do it.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m honored.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, David.</p>
