    <p>Our card this week is Brian Sullivan, the Three of Spades from New York.</p>
<p>In 2007, 19-year-old Brian was enjoying his summer, hanging out and making music with</p>
<p>friends when one July day he vanished without a trace.</p>
<p>Over the past 15 years, law enforcement&rsquo;s investigation has yielded answers to many</p>
<p>of the questions surrounding his disappearance, but not the one still weighing on his friends</p>
<p>and family daily.</p>
<p>Where is Brian?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>On July 8, 2007, Barbara and Dan Sullivan were enjoying a warm summer afternoon at home</p>
<p>in Chile, New York, when they were startled by a knock on their door.</p>
<p>It was a deputy with the Monroe County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office asking to speak to their 19-year-old</p>
<p>son Brian, but Brian wasn&rsquo;t home.</p>
<p>He hadn&rsquo;t been for almost a whole day at this point.</p>
<p>Once he was unavailable, the deputy let Barbara and Dan know that their son&rsquo;s red 95 Pontiac</p>
<p>Sunfire was found abandoned at the end of a dead-end street in the suburb town of Gates,</p>
<p>which is about a 10-minute drive northeast of the Sullivans&rsquo; home.</p>
<p>The deputy questioned Barbara and Dan about their son&rsquo;s whereabouts, like when they had</p>
<p>last seen him.</p>
<p>They said 4 p.m. the previous day.</p>
<p>They said they saw him as they left to take their dog for a walk, but when they returned,</p>
<p>Brian and his car were gone.</p>
<p>The deputy then asked about his mental health history, but there was nothing worth telling</p>
<p>there either.</p>
<p>No history of any known issues.</p>
<p>What about drugs, he said.</p>
<p>And to their knowledge, Brian didn&rsquo;t use hard drugs.</p>
<p>I mean, he smoked weed recreationally, but as far as they knew, that was it.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t know why Brian&rsquo;s car would be on some random street in Gates, and they couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think of any friends that he even had in that town.</p>
<p>Part of the deputy&rsquo;s report from that day reads, quote, Sullivan&rsquo;s parents did not seem</p>
<p>overtly concerned with him not coming home.</p>
<p>They said it was not abnormal for him to go away for a day or so, end quote.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s true that Brian&rsquo;s abandoned car didn&rsquo;t send Dan and Barbara spiraling because they</p>
<p>knew their son had been having car trouble recently, and he also had a habit of not coming</p>
<p>home for a day or two at a time.</p>
<p>They likely just assumed that his car died, he ditched it on that dead-end road, and then</p>
<p>went to stay with a friend or something.</p>
<p>But that night, Brian still didn&rsquo;t come home, and he wasn&rsquo;t answering his cell phone.</p>
<p>So the following day, Barbara and Dan went to Gates to get the car for him.</p>
<p>Just like the deputy said, it was at the end of a dead-end street, Leadington Avenue.</p>
<p>The car was locked with nobody inside, and peering through the windows, Barbara and Dan</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t see much.</p>
<p>The car was locked, and they didn&rsquo;t have a spare key, so they phoned a mechanic who came</p>
<p>and broke in using one of those Slim Jim tools.</p>
<p>Barbara and Dan then had the car towed back to their house, where they began cleaning</p>
<p>it out.</p>
<p>Inside, they found empty Burger King wrappers and a Burger King receipt, timestamped July</p>
<p>8th at 5.38 a.m.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the same day that the deputy would later show up at their house.</p>
<p>Brian&rsquo;s wallet was also in the car.</p>
<p>The wallet had his bank card, but it was missing his driver&rsquo;s license.</p>
<p>Now even this isn&rsquo;t that weird, because it was actually pretty common for Brian to not</p>
<p>keep his wallet on his person.</p>
<p>After going through Brian&rsquo;s car, his parents had an uneasy feeling, but they weren&rsquo;t going</p>
<p>to report their son missing just yet.</p>
<p>He was an adult, and there was nothing illegal about going off the grid for a day or two.</p>
<p>I mean, like they told the deputy, this kind of thing has happened before.</p>
<p>Brian would disappear for a few days, then show back up safe and sound.</p>
<p>And Barbara and Dan were holding tight to the hope that this was just another one of</p>
<p>those times.</p>
<p>But as the hours tick by with no sign of Brian, their hope begins to fade.</p>
<p>Over the next few days, Barbara and Dan reached out to Brian&rsquo;s closest friends and relatives,</p>
<p>anyone they could think of, to get the 411 on his whereabouts.</p>
<p>But no one had seen him since the wee hours of the morning on July 8th, the day that his</p>
<p>car was found.</p>
<p>By the time Wednesday rolled around, it had been four days since they&rsquo;d seen or heard</p>
<p>from Brian.</p>
<p>And by now, they knew in their gut that something was terribly wrong.</p>
<p>With a lump in their throat, Barbara went to the Monroe County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office to</p>
<p>file a missing persons report for their son.</p>
<p>She told investigators about Brian&rsquo;s car being found in Gates and how no one had seen</p>
<p>or heard from him in days.</p>
<p>She couldn&rsquo;t think of any reason that he would want to run away.</p>
<p>She wasn&rsquo;t on bad terms with him, and there was no recent problems at home or with any</p>
<p>of his friends that she could think of.</p>
<p>According to police reports, Barbara did say that Dan had given Brian an ultimatum recently.</p>
<p>He had to get a job or move out.</p>
<p>And the deadline for that was July 9th.</p>
<p>But according to later reporting by Rochester newspaper, The Democrat and Chronicle, Barbara</p>
<p>characterized the ultimatum as more of a joke than a serious warning.</p>
<p>And they actually teased him about counting down the days.</p>
<p>She said, quote,</p>
<p>We told him he had to get a job, but we weren&rsquo;t fighting or anything.</p>
<p>We told him he had to get one in a week, but we didn&rsquo;t say he had to move out if he didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>Barbara let investigators know that her son regularly used cannabis and alcohol, but police</p>
<p>reports don&rsquo;t seem to indicate that he ever struggled with a substance use disorder.</p>
<p>It seems like it was just casual recreational use.</p>
<p>But other than that, she couldn&rsquo;t think of anything that would possibly be related to</p>
<p>his sudden vanishing.</p>
<p>While the sheriff&rsquo;s office was launching its own investigation into Brian&rsquo;s disappearance,</p>
<p>Barbara and Dan were continuing theirs.</p>
<p>In the following days, they returned several times to Leadington Avenue where Brian&rsquo;s car</p>
<p>was found and walked the nearby trails looking for any clues.</p>
<p>They even recruited friends and family to help in their searches.</p>
<p>But nothing turned up.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s investigator Phil Trubia with the Monroe County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been involved in the investigation since its early days.</p>
<p>I believe that Barbara was just following her motherly instincts and just doing everything</p>
<p>she could to try and lead or to suggest to police that something more sinister was involved.</p>
<p>If it was in fact involved, other than, you know, just finding the car abandoned somewhere.</p>
<p>Since their search of Leadington Avenue found nothing, Barbara and Dan turned to technology.</p>
<p>They logged into Brian&rsquo;s T-Mobile cell phone account.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when their hearts really sank.</p>
<p>His records indicated that his phone hadn&rsquo;t been used since early in the morning on July</p>
<p>8th.</p>
<p>Barbara called the sheriff&rsquo;s office to let them know about this discovery.</p>
<p>She also let investigators know that she&rsquo;d done some snooping around at home and found</p>
<p>that all of Brian&rsquo;s toiletries were still there, along with an uncashed $700 check made</p>
<p>out to him.</p>
<p>To her, this is more evidence that Brian didn&rsquo;t just up and run away.</p>
<p>Barbara reiterated to investigators that her son wasn&rsquo;t diagnosed with a mental illness</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;d never tried to hurt himself.</p>
<p>So she thought suicide was off the table too.</p>
<p>Investigators at the sheriff&rsquo;s office wanted to know more about Brian&rsquo;s phone usage, particularly</p>
<p>who his last call was to and where it was made from.</p>
<p>So on July 13th, they reached out to T-Mobile and filed a request for his phone records.</p>
<p>And while investigators were waiting for those, other sheriff&rsquo;s office personnel were headed</p>
<p>to the area where Brian&rsquo;s car was found to launch a full-scale search for Brian.</p>
<p>Now the Gates Police Department had done a search of their own when Brian&rsquo;s car was found</p>
<p>on July 8th, but this was the first official search after Brian was declared missing.</p>
<p>The sheriff&rsquo;s office scoured the area on foot, even broke out the big guns, the K-9</p>
<p>unit, but nothing showed up.</p>
<p>Since nothing notable was found on Leadington Avenue, a deputy went to the Sullivans&rsquo; home</p>
<p>and searched there for clues.</p>
<p>He inspected Brian&rsquo;s car and his bedroom for anything that Barbara and Dan might&rsquo;ve missed,</p>
<p>but the search didn&rsquo;t turn up anything helpful.</p>
<p>Later that same day, investigators heard back from T-Mobile.</p>
<p>They said that Brian&rsquo;s phone hadn&rsquo;t been on for the past two or three days, and his</p>
<p>last call was made at around 6 a.m. on July 8th.</p>
<p>And that call hit a tower in the Churchville area, which is just a few minutes outside</p>
<p>of Chi-Li.</p>
<p>And it was made to Tim McDonald.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Brian&rsquo;s longtime best friend.</p>
<p>Detectives got a hold of Tim and asked him if he knew anything about Brian&rsquo;s whereabouts.</p>
<p>He said that the last time he talked to Brian was around 10 p.m. on July 7th.</p>
<p>Tim was hanging out with his girlfriend when Brian called and asked him what he was doing.</p>
<p>They chatted a bit.</p>
<p>Brian told Tim that he was with a friend on his way to buy some cigarettes and that he&rsquo;d</p>
<p>just been hanging out at Tim&rsquo;s uncle&rsquo;s house, watching a movie.</p>
<p>After Trubia told our reporting team that it seemed like Brian hanging out with Tim&rsquo;s</p>
<p>uncle was actually a normal thing.</p>
<p>I mean, Brian and Tim were close enough that Brian often went to their family gatherings,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s likely that this would have been nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>Brian and Tim&rsquo;s whole conversation that night was only a couple of minutes long, and that</p>
<p>was the last time Tim talked to him.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t the last time he heard from him.</p>
<p>Tim said that he had also received two voicemails from Brian early on July 8th.</p>
<p>The first message left was at around 3 a.m. and it was Brian saying, quote,</p>
<p>This is the realm.</p>
<p>This is the realm.</p>
<p>This is the realm.</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>The second message left was around 6 10 a.m. and it was Brian saying, quote,</p>
<p>This is just a preview.</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>Now, both of those to me are totally out there, but it&rsquo;s actually not as weird as you think</p>
<p>when you dig in, because Tim said that those were lyrics to a song that he and Brian were</p>
<p>trying to write.</p>
<p>Investigators asked him what he thought happened to Brian, and he said that he wouldn&rsquo;t put</p>
<p>it past him to just take off and change his identity.</p>
<p>Tim said that because of the recent pressure from Brian&rsquo;s parents to get a job at first,</p>
<p>he thought he might have just taken off to prove a point.</p>
<p>But Tim said that he would have definitely called him by now just to let him know that</p>
<p>he was OK, but that call had never come.</p>
<p>So Tim now thought that something more serious might have happened to Brian.</p>
<p>After talking with Tim, investigators felt like they had a better idea of Brian&rsquo;s personality</p>
<p>and habits, but they were no closer to finding him.</p>
<p>So they continued their investigation.</p>
<p>They went to the Burger King that the receipt in Brian&rsquo;s car was from and talked to an employee</p>
<p>who remembered Brian coming through the drive through that morning.</p>
<p>They said Brian appeared to be alone in the car and they didn&rsquo;t have any other helpful</p>
<p>information.</p>
<p>On July 13th, investigators were notified that Brian missed a probation appointment.</p>
<p>He was on probation for burglary and missing an appointment was something totally out of</p>
<p>character for him.</p>
<p>Detectives went and talked to his probation officer, who said that Brian had been doing</p>
<p>really well with his probation and showing up to all his check-ins.</p>
<p>But he did say something that raised some eyebrows.</p>
<p>He said that Brian was trying to get his probation transferred to Memphis, Tennessee, where his</p>
<p>sister lived.</p>
<p>But his sister says that she hadn&rsquo;t seen or heard from Brian recently, so it seemed</p>
<p>like that wasn&rsquo;t the reason for his sudden disappearance.</p>
<p>At this point, Brian had been missing almost an entire week and investigators felt like</p>
<p>they were no closer to finding him.</p>
<p>Over the next week, detectives kept returning again and again to the area Brian&rsquo;s car was</p>
<p>found in in Gates.</p>
<p>They were conducting searches, expanding their perimeter, searching more and more, but all</p>
<p>of their searches turned up nothing.</p>
<p>They went knocking on doors in the area, asking if anyone had seen anything, but everyone</p>
<p>they talked to said they hadn&rsquo;t seen anything suspicious.</p>
<p>On July 18th, Brian&rsquo;s disappearance hit the news with a plea from his mother.</p>
<p>The Democrat and Chronicle quoted Barbara saying,</p>
<p>Come home.</p>
<p>Just come home.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not mad.</p>
<p>About two weeks after Brian was last heard from, the Monroe County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>got a promising tip.</p>
<p>A woman called in and said that she thought she&rsquo;d seen Brian on July 23rd at a Wegmans</p>
<p>grocery store, which is a 30-minute drive south of Chi Lai.</p>
<p>Investigators went to the Wegmans and got security footage.</p>
<p>They found the man that the caller had seen, and it sure did look a lot like Brian.</p>
<p>In fact, it looked so much like him that investigators asked Brian&rsquo;s parents to look at the footage</p>
<p>to see if they thought it was him.</p>
<p>But Barbara and Dan said that the man in the video wasn&rsquo;t their son.</p>
<p>It was disappointing, but the very next day, investigators got another tip, and this one</p>
<p>was the biggest tip they&rsquo;d received yet.</p>
<p>Someone called into Crimestoppers anonymously, saying that Brian had been stabbed to death</p>
<p>by a man named Derrick Murray.</p>
<p>The caller said Derrick also went by the nickname Black.</p>
<p>Since the tip was anonymous, there was no way to know if it was reliable or not, but</p>
<p>investigators weren&rsquo;t taking any chances.</p>
<p>For days, investigators tried to track down this Derrick Murray guy.</p>
<p>They found some of his relatives and told them that they wanted to talk to Derrick about</p>
<p>the Brian Sullivan case, but the relatives claimed that they didn&rsquo;t have any way to contact Derrick.</p>
<p>But apparently, someone knew how to get in touch with him, because the next day, investigators</p>
<p>got a call from Derrick himself.</p>
<p>He told detectives that he was willing to talk, and they could swing by the local barbershop</p>
<p>that he worked at to have a conversation.</p>
<p>Investigators wasted no time and headed straight there.</p>
<p>Now, detectives didn&rsquo;t tell Derrick that someone had implicated him in Brian&rsquo;s disappearance</p>
<p>or potential murder.</p>
<p>They just told him that someone had seen him with Brian shortly before he went missing,</p>
<p>and they just wanted to know if he had any information that could be helpful to their</p>
<p>investigation.</p>
<p>Derrick said that he knew Brian was missing, he&rsquo;d actually seen his face on the news,</p>
<p>but he didn&rsquo;t actually know Brian all that well, and he said he didn&rsquo;t have any information</p>
<p>about his disappearance.</p>
<p>He said that they knew each other from a local bar called the Chai Lai Inn, and they&rsquo;d hung</p>
<p>out to smoke and drink together before.</p>
<p>But beyond that, Derrick didn&rsquo;t say he knew anything helpful.</p>
<p>But police weren&rsquo;t buying it.</p>
<p>After meeting with Derrick, they went to his girlfriend&rsquo;s apartment, where he had been</p>
<p>staying recently.</p>
<p>Detectives knocked on the door and his girlfriend answered, but she refused to let them come</p>
<p>inside and take a look around.</p>
<p>Detectives tried to talk to Derrick&rsquo;s girlfriend a week later, but she was still uncooperative</p>
<p>and wanted nothing to do with the investigation.</p>
<p>Now detectives didn&rsquo;t have enough probable cause for a search warrant at this point,</p>
<p>so they decided to move on.</p>
<p>But later that month, another tipster came forward, and this tip was also about Derrick.</p>
<p>The tipster said that he heard from a friend that Derrick and Brian were doing drugs together</p>
<p>one day when, for some reason, a fight broke out.</p>
<p>Derrick got so angry that he stabbed Brian to death, buried his body somewhere, then</p>
<p>paid someone $30 to dump the car.</p>
<p>He said that Derrick confessed to the murder to a man who we&rsquo;re going to call Rex, and</p>
<p>then Rex then told someone else who told the tipster.</p>
<p>Now this sounds like a long game of telephone, so probably not a super reliable tip, but</p>
<p>this was the second time they&rsquo;d heard Derrick&rsquo;s name brought up, also the second time they</p>
<p>hear about him stabbing Brian.</p>
<p>So after talking with the tipster, investigators went to Derrick&rsquo;s workplace to try and talk</p>
<p>to him again, but this time he wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>And they got the impression it wouldn&rsquo;t be easy to find him.</p>
<p>According to police reports, other employees of the barbershop told them that Derrick had</p>
<p>actually moved to Orlando about a week and a half or two weeks ago because of some problems</p>
<p>he was having, but they wouldn&rsquo;t elaborate on what those problems were.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear whether investigators tried to reach Derrick in Orlando, or if it was</p>
<p>even true that he moved there at all, but it seems likely because they didn&rsquo;t hear</p>
<p>from him for a few months.</p>
<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t the last time they heard his name.</p>
<p>In September, another tipster came forward and said a man named Rex told her that Derrick</p>
<p>killed Brian.</p>
<p>Rex said that Brian and Derrick were doing drugs together, Derrick got angry, so he hit</p>
<p>Brian in the head and killed him.</p>
<p>Now since two people say that they heard a story from Rex, investigators decide to</p>
<p>track him down to get the story straight from the horse&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>Later that month, they found Rex, and they asked him some questions about Derrick and</p>
<p>about Brian, but Rex said that he didn&rsquo;t know anything.</p>
<p>He claimed that he never had any conversation with Derrick about Brian, and he flat out</p>
<p>denied having any knowledge about his disappearance.</p>
<p>Investigators went and talked to Rex again in October, but he still denied knowing anything.</p>
<p>And with that, the investigation went from a slow roll to a screeching halt.</p>
<p>While detectives were trying to keep Brian&rsquo;s case from going cold, Barbara and Dan were</p>
<p>left picking up the pieces, hoping their son would come bursting through the front door</p>
<p>at any moment and everything would go back to normal.</p>
<p>They missed his personality and his jokes.</p>
<p>Investigator Trubia said Brian had this dry sense of humor and was known for being hilarious,</p>
<p>and he was also a talented, dedicated musician.</p>
<p>He liked all kinds of music.</p>
<p>He had recently, prior to going missing, he had ordered a bunch of audio producing equipment,</p>
<p>like music equipment, and was planning on trying his hand at creating music or producing</p>
<p>music.</p>
<p>He was into the rap genre at the time, and that was kind of what was driving him at his</p>
<p>age.</p>
<p>He was constantly writing down, like, his thoughts in little notepads that would pop</p>
<p>into his head, and he had all kinds of little notepads where he wrote down lyrics that he</p>
<p>thought were good.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until January of 2008, six months after Brian disappeared, that investigators</p>
<p>caught a break.</p>
<p>They got word that Derek was back in town working at a barbershop.</p>
<p>Investigators went to the barber, found Derek, and pulled him aside for a conversation.</p>
<p>And for the first time, they let him know that he was officially a suspect in their</p>
<p>investigation into Brian&rsquo;s disappearance.</p>
<p>But once again, Derek denied any involvement or knowledge of Brian&rsquo;s whereabouts.</p>
<p>Over the coming several months, investigators&rsquo; suspicions surrounding Derek grew.</p>
<p>More and more people came forward saying that Derek had confessed to murdering Brian.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d either heard it from someone else, or Derek himself had told them.</p>
<p>And every tipster&rsquo;s story was virtually the same.</p>
<p>Derek and Brian were doing drugs together, some kind of fight broke out, and then Derek</p>
<p>stabbed Brian.</p>
<p>In June 2009, investigators tried going back to Derek&rsquo;s girlfriend&rsquo;s apartment, hoping</p>
<p>that she had a change of heart and would be willing to talk to them, maybe let them take</p>
<p>a look around.</p>
<p>But when they knocked on the door, they were greeted by a new resident, who said that she</p>
<p>had moved in around the end of April, maybe beginning of May.</p>
<p>They asked her if she noticed any bloodstains or unusual damage to the apartment when she</p>
<p>moved in.</p>
<p>And she said, you know what, there actually was something that I found really odd.</p>
<p>The new tenant said there was one large dark stain in the bedroom area, and she invited</p>
<p>detectives in to take a look at the stain for themselves.</p>
<p>And they agreed, it did look suspicious.</p>
<p>The new resident and the landlord agreed to let crime scene technicians come and collect</p>
<p>whatever they needed.</p>
<p>The technicians went and got samples from the stained carpet and some samples of dark</p>
<p>substance found on the bedroom wall.</p>
<p>They sent all of that off to the Monroe County Public Safety Lab for analysis, and the results</p>
<p>came back quickly for once.</p>
<p>No blood detected.</p>
<p>After that, the investigation seemingly hit a wall again.</p>
<p>In August 2009, someone thought they saw Brian working at a hotel in Niagara Falls.</p>
<p>Investigators asked the Niagara Falls Police Department to go check for Brian at the hotel,</p>
<p>and they actually found the man that the tipster was talking about.</p>
<p>According to police reports, the guy did look a lot like Brian, but he wasn&rsquo;t Brian Sullivan.</p>
<p>Again, in April of 2010, someone called in another sighting of Brian, but this tip was</p>
<p>a bit different.</p>
<p>A woman who we&rsquo;ll call Kendall told investigators that in 2008, she had taken in a person experiencing</p>
<p>homelessness who closely resembled Brian.</p>
<p>The man said that his name was Michael Alexis, but he&rsquo;d been arrested once under the name</p>
<p>Samuel.</p>
<p>Kendall said that she lived with the man for about two months before he took off on a bus</p>
<p>to go to New York City.</p>
<p>Kendall gave photos of the man to investigators who then showed the photos to Brian&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>But once again, it wasn&rsquo;t him.</p>
<p>Later in 2010, Brian&rsquo;s case was featured in an episode of Psychic Kids on the A&amp;E Network.</p>
<p>And that feature did generate a new tip.</p>
<p>A woman in North Carolina saw the episode and called the sheriff&rsquo;s office saying that</p>
<p>she thought Brian might be an acquaintance of hers.</p>
<p>She gave police the guy&rsquo;s Facebook page, and the profile picture, again, did pretty closely</p>
<p>resemble Brian, but sure enough, it wasn&rsquo;t him.</p>
<p>Just another dead end.</p>
<p>By 2011, investigators were convinced Brian wasn&rsquo;t out there living another life.</p>
<p>Something bad had happened.</p>
<p>So they renewed the search for his remains.</p>
<p>They expanded that search perimeter and searched in places that they hadn&rsquo;t before, using</p>
<p>cadaver dogs.</p>
<p>And on July 30th, investigators thought they might&rsquo;ve found something.</p>
<p>Along the railroad tracks beside Chile Avenue, investigators found a partial vertebra.</p>
<p>They were hopeful at first, but they quickly determined that it was animal remains, not</p>
<p>human.</p>
<p>But moments after finding that vertebra, about 10 feet from the tracks, two different cadaver</p>
<p>dogs indicated that they smelled possible human remains.</p>
<p>Searchers didn&rsquo;t immediately see any remains, so they came back another day with the same</p>
<p>two dogs.</p>
<p>And again, they both indicated the scent of human remains in the same spot.</p>
<p>So a few more days later, detectives did a follow-up search with two dogs that hadn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>participated in the previous searches, but neither of them indicated the smell of human</p>
<p>remains in that exact spot.</p>
<p>One of them seemed interested in an area about 40 yards away from the spot, and the other</p>
<p>was also interested in a spot like 15 feet away.</p>
<p>So investigators organized a thorough search of all of the areas.</p>
<p>And for hours, crews searched and searched, but no human remains were found.</p>
<p>Over the next few years, investigators honed in on Derek.</p>
<p>They knew in their gut that he had something to do with Brian&rsquo;s disappearance, so they</p>
<p>started surveilling him.</p>
<p>On several different occasions, they staked out Derek&rsquo;s workplace, hoping that they&rsquo;d</p>
<p>see something that would at least be a piece of the puzzle that they needed to charge him.</p>
<p>Investigator Trubia was assigned to the surveillance unit at that time, and he went on several</p>
<p>of those surveillance details.</p>
<p>Even from afar, investigator Trubia got the feeling that Derek was hiding something.</p>
<p>My impression of Derek was that he was bearing a heavy burden.</p>
<p>He either made a horrible decision or was possibly defending himself, killed Brian Sullivan,</p>
<p>and wanted to be free of that burden, but was afraid to come forward to law enforcement.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my opinion.</p>
<p>The surveillance didn&rsquo;t stop at stakeouts.</p>
<p>The sheriff&rsquo;s office put wires on confidential informants and had them go talk with Derek.</p>
<p>For security reasons, the sheriff&rsquo;s office didn&rsquo;t want to get into how many confidential</p>
<p>informants were used or what information they gathered.</p>
<p>But it was enough for police to be confident that Derek was their guy.</p>
<p>By summer 2016, they felt that they had probable cause to arrest Derek for Brian&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>But without knowing where Brian&rsquo;s remains were or knowing more specific details about</p>
<p>the murder, they knew prosecution would be virtually impossible.</p>
<p>So the sheriff&rsquo;s office and the county DA&rsquo;s office hatched a plan.</p>
<p>They had evidence to prove Derek was committing another crime, welfare fraud.</p>
<p>He was collecting welfare payments while also working at a barbershop and not disclosing</p>
<p>his wages.</p>
<p>So investigators decided that they would arrest Derek for that crime, and while they had him</p>
<p>in custody, they would interview him and try and figure out where he hid Brian&rsquo;s remains.</p>
<p>The paperwork was all lined up for the arrest, and the plan was for all of this to go down</p>
<p>in August 2016.</p>
<p>But literal days before the arrest was planned, the unexpected happened.</p>
<p>On August 15th, Derek died of a heart attack at age 49.</p>
<p>Derek&rsquo;s death must have been a crushing blow for investigators and Brian&rsquo;s family,</p>
<p>because it meant that he could never be held accountable for taking another life.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, investigators knew that those with information about the murder</p>
<p>and the location of Brian&rsquo;s remains might now be more willing to talk since they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to fear retribution from Derek anymore.</p>
<p>Police reached out to several of Derek&rsquo;s relatives, hoping someone would cooperate</p>
<p>now that he had died, but none of them provided any useful information.</p>
<p>So on August 26th, same year, 2016, the sheriff&rsquo;s office held a press conference announcing</p>
<p>that Derek Murray was the only suspect in Brian&rsquo;s murder, and they were asking anyone</p>
<p>with information or knowledge of the crime or the location of Brian&rsquo;s body to contact them.</p>
<p>This actually generated a few tips, people saying that Derek confessed the murder to</p>
<p>them, but nothing that helped them locate Brian&rsquo;s remains.</p>
<p>In 2017, Brian&rsquo;s murder was officially reclassified as closed by death of offender, but his missing</p>
<p>person&rsquo;s case is still active and ongoing to this day.</p>
<p>We asked investigator Trubia what he thinks happened to Brian on July 8th, 2007.</p>
<p>I believe he was hanging out with Derek Murray.</p>
<p>Their paths crossed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it was anything crazy to begin with.</p>
<p>A physical altercation occurred.</p>
<p>You know, it could have been self-defense on Derek Murray&rsquo;s part.</p>
<p>It could have been where Brian was the aggressor.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know those facts, but once that physical altercation occurred, I think that Derek Murray</p>
<p>either made a very bad decision or was self-defending himself, and Brian was killed, and then he</p>
<p>was taken from this house somewhere off of Chilay Avenue and moved to a different location</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t know of.</p>
<p>And then I believe that friends and family of Derek Murray know information, know where</p>
<p>it happened exactly, know where Brian was moved to.</p>
<p>At the very least, I know somebody knows who moved Brian&rsquo;s car.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t Brian that moved it, it was somebody else that moved it there.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of people out there that know what&rsquo;s happening, what happened, and</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t be charged with providing information now that it&rsquo;s point.</p>
<p>They can just tell us anonymously if they want, or they can even collect a reward as</p>
<p>far as finding where Brian is right now.</p>
<p>People out there know, and hopefully they&rsquo;re listening, and they can provide that information</p>
<p>to the sheriff&rsquo;s office or even to Brian&rsquo;s parents.</p>
<p>Obviously it would mean the world to Brian&rsquo;s parents.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been so frustrated knowing how he died and who did it.</p>
<p>They want nothing more than to know where Brian is now so that they can have closure</p>
<p>and more importantly, peace.</p>
<p>They just want to be able to, whenever, every time I talk to the Sullivan&rsquo;s, they just want</p>
<p>to bring Brian home.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they say to me time and time again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been 15 long years since Barbara and Dan have seen their son.</p>
<p>Although they believe beyond a reasonable doubt who harmed Brian, they are still waiting</p>
<p>for the closure of bringing him home.</p>
<p>If you know anything about where Brian Sullivan&rsquo;s remains are hidden, please speak up.</p>
<p>You can call the Rochester area Crime Stoppers and remain completely anonymous.</p>
<p>This will give the family closure.</p>
<p>Call Crime Stoppers at 585-423-9300, or you can call the Monroe County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>directly at 585-753-4177.</p>
<p>Brian&rsquo;s parents are offering a $2,500 reward.</p>
<p>The Deck is an AudioChuck production with theme music by Ryan Lewis.</p>
