<h2 id="transcript">Transcript</h2>
<p>Ôªøhey guys I have a great interview today</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically a follow-up we&rsquo;ve done a</p>
<p>couple different recordings over the</p>
<p>last few years and Steven is here hi</p>
<p>Steven how are you doing I&rsquo;m doing good</p>
<p>how are you guys good</p>
<p>so the reason I wanted to bring you back</p>
<p>on is because you have an incredible</p>
<p>incredible story I&rsquo;m just going to let</p>
<p>you kind of give everyone just a</p>
<p>thumbnail sketch of where you were and</p>
<p>how you actually came to where you are</p>
<p>right now as far as your weight and your</p>
<p>health and so why don&rsquo;t you just kind of</p>
<p>give us a brief summary of that back in</p>
<p>2015 I was weighing 600 10 pounds and I</p>
<p>basically wanted to lose weight I wanted</p>
<p>to retire here when I was like 14 age 50</p>
<p>here which I&rsquo;m doing this year so I had</p>
<p>to find a solution to lose that weight</p>
<p>and I kind of got onto a Joe Rogan and I</p>
<p>found out about keto I loved September</p>
<p>first took me about a month of studying</p>
<p>following dr. Byrd Jimmy Moore some of</p>
<p>the originals back then in October 6th I</p>
<p>basically started on the day of my</p>
<p>birthday and by two years later I was</p>
<p>down 344 pounds and now it&rsquo;s been almost</p>
<p>four years and I&rsquo;m down 367 pounds and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve kept it off and now life&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>great so basically the big weight loss</p>
<p>is two years and then I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>basically maintaining building muscle</p>
<p>and just kind of staying in that same</p>
<p>little category but having really good</p>
<p>improvements over the last two years</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I want to dive in like right</p>
<p>right now how much do you weigh I&rsquo;m 242</p>
<p>ok I can&rsquo;t quite I can&rsquo;t seem to quite</p>
<p>get down anywhere like I&rsquo;m pretty lean</p>
<p>for my size that&rsquo;s a weird one away but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing lot of muscle I&rsquo;m going up so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m cut you know for the last two years</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in that 242 to 248 range I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just kind of staying in there but</p>
<p>clothing size has gone down stuff like</p>
<p>that so it&rsquo;s two different</p>
<p>transformation Wow</p>
<p>last year you came to our summit and I</p>
<p>was exciting</p>
<p>if we compare last year with now not</p>
<p>just weight but any other health</p>
<p>improvements that you noticed just from</p>
<p>the last year well what I&rsquo;ve noticed in</p>
<p>the last year is like I told you I had</p>
<p>water retention in my lower legs and I</p>
<p>was having a skin issue where if I just</p>
<p>touched it was it was really weak and it</p>
<p>was damaged over this last year I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been doing once a week I do a two days</p>
<p>fast and then every 45 days I&rsquo;ll do five</p>
<p>days five monistic that my skin is</p>
<p>actually getting stronger I&rsquo;m not having</p>
<p>that issue I still have this skin issue</p>
<p>it hasn&rsquo;t gone back of you know I was so</p>
<p>big I was made Act but just overall like</p>
<p>health mental traveling like it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>amazing like a do it</p>
<p>come live from the first year from</p>
<p>honester to this year I was just kind of</p>
<p>getting into I was really skinny for a</p>
<p>year now I&rsquo;ve been almost two years and</p>
<p>just the whole quality of life like easy</p>
<p>to travel workout clothes the way people</p>
<p>look at you and because you&rsquo;re in a</p>
<p>whole new basic I&rsquo;m like a normal person</p>
<p>now compared to where it used to be so</p>
<p>how yeah so those of you who are</p>
<p>watching and you really don&rsquo;t know much</p>
<p>about it</p>
<p>stephen is a is doing a combination of</p>
<p>keto ketogenic diet and in a minute</p>
<p>fasting together and I think you do one</p>
<p>mill a day yeah so basically now for two</p>
<p>years I&rsquo;ve been doing one meal a day and</p>
<p>I do it above eight o&rsquo;clock at night and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically because just have like</p>
<p>two hamburgers and cheese and some</p>
<p>spices in one big salad and that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>I eat every day and I do 45 minutes of</p>
<p>cardio pretty hard like I do the roller</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my new thing I&rsquo;m on the rower in</p>
<p>that the concept to ski and machines</p>
<p>below to my to ones I do and I do that</p>
<p>45 minutes then I do usually a good 45</p>
<p>minutes that&rsquo;s pretty heavy you like</p>
<p>eight so and I do that every I do that</p>
<p>five days a week and then I&rsquo;ll do cardio</p>
<p>maybe one day on the weekend and I only</p>
<p>have one plus at work all day and and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of days where like I</p>
<p>travel quite a bit I&rsquo;ll just skip eating</p>
<p>for two days because you know if I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>flying around many airports I just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even and Kimmy it&rsquo;s been going well and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been getting quite a bit of muscle</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what everybody keeps trying to</p>
<p>tell me is like oh you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>catapult yourself like you</p>
<p>your muscle but I&rsquo;m getting stronger I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>getting more sighs and I&rsquo;m very very</p>
<p>consistent on what I do with my eating</p>
<p>Wow and it&rsquo;s end of portion and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know I&rsquo;ve been having a really good</p>
<p>result so I don&rsquo;t you know it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>interesting when Tom McLaury I want to</p>
<p>talk to him and he does Aikido I want to</p>
<p>you know kind of compare to him what he</p>
<p>thinks but I don&rsquo;t think you need all</p>
<p>that food to gain the muscle no in fact</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple points I want to bring</p>
<p>up about that like the real reason why</p>
<p>keto and I F work so well from a</p>
<p>scientific basis but first I want to</p>
<p>talk about muscle protein print muscle</p>
<p>protein you know if you eat a hamburger</p>
<p>for example you&rsquo;re only gonna get maybe</p>
<p>thirty seven percent of that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be actual protein the rest is like water</p>
<p>and fiber and collagen and stuff that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not digesting so we&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>about 37% of it&rsquo;s going to be digestible</p>
<p>protein so and then what happens there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of those proteins amino acids are</p>
<p>going to be used for repair replacement</p>
<p>but honestly your body is not shedding</p>
<p>or getting rid of protein as fast as you</p>
<p>think so we&rsquo;re we constantly recycling</p>
<p>our our nutrients and our amino acids</p>
<p>and in other nutrients tubes and I</p>
<p>workout most days I&rsquo;m working out fasted</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s another thing that a lot of</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t understand so I don&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>before I work out so I&rsquo;ve worked all day</p>
<p>now so I beats me to eight o&rsquo;clock and I</p>
<p>saw and then I get up in the morning I</p>
<p>go to work I get home at five o&rsquo;clock</p>
<p>and then I basically go into doing</p>
<p>cardio I going to do my workout and then</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually feeling really good and if</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t tell myself to go eat that a day</p>
<p>I probably don&rsquo;t have to and I still</p>
<p>have lots of energy I&rsquo;m still doing like</p>
<p>you know abs at the end like I do I do</p>
<p>not lack for the energy and the strength</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t feel drained or anything and</p>
<p>then I basically then I basically go eat</p>
<p>then I relax and then I know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bedtime for me but that&rsquo;s why MIT day</p>
<p>works out for me I like eating later at</p>
<p>night because then everything is kind of</p>
<p>settled down and I&rsquo;m ready for my next</p>
<p>day and then I</p>
<p>start over again okay I like the what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing because the the part of the</p>
<p>nervous system called the</p>
<p>flight-or-fight works during the day at</p>
<p>night in the evening things are winding</p>
<p>down</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called parasympathetic rest and</p>
<p>digest so you&rsquo;re actually your body</p>
<p>naturally is gonna do a little bit</p>
<p>better with digestion in the evening</p>
<p>then in the morning believe it or not so</p>
<p>then you actually eat you could you go</p>
<p>to bed and you recycle that long but the</p>
<p>point I was gonna bring up is that um</p>
<p>when you do in a minute fasting you</p>
<p>cause your body to start to run only on</p>
<p>ketones and fatty acids and when that</p>
<p>happens your body then starts to recycle</p>
<p>nutrients way more than if you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>frequently because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re adding a little bit of a</p>
<p>so-called starvation stress which is not</p>
<p>really starvation but if you don&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>it creates a little bit of stress enough</p>
<p>to cause your body to adapt to that and</p>
<p>start being very conservative with the</p>
<p>nutrients so you start recycling the</p>
<p>nutrients so that the amount of</p>
<p>nutrients you need so heck of a lot less</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why you can get by with a little</p>
<p>smaller amount of food because your body</p>
<p>is running off your factor which is</p>
<p>designed in an average thin person has</p>
<p>close to that 70 to 80 thousand calories</p>
<p>of fat as reserve we will have like</p>
<p>1,700 stored calories of sugar so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not natural to run your body of sugar so</p>
<p>when you convert over to fat by reducing</p>
<p>your carbohydrates all these wonderful</p>
<p>things happen with the with the cells</p>
<p>with the mitochondria store get more</p>
<p>energy your cognitive function improved</p>
<p>your mood so no you&rsquo;re not going to lose</p>
<p>your muscle you&rsquo;re not going to wither</p>
<p>away but you know if you actually ate</p>
<p>probably six times a day and you try to</p>
<p>lose weight with calories you probably</p>
<p>would have a lot of muscle problem</p>
<p>because you would you&rsquo;d still have the</p>
<p>insulin resistance I don&rsquo;t think you</p>
<p>when you wish when they originally</p>
<p>tested you did they ever find anything</p>
<p>like a pre-diabetic State well yeah I</p>
<p>was a little bit high when I was 610 I</p>
<p>was around 11 to 8 in there I was just</p>
<p>on the verge of pre</p>
<p>but as soon as I started Kido I went</p>
<p>back to the diabetes doctor and I had</p>
<p>dropped right down that was even a month</p>
<p>in and I was right down I thought she</p>
<p>below five and then with my blood sugars</p>
<p>and then after that I was I was cruising</p>
<p>along like and the thing about like me</p>
<p>is you probably understand I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>pretty consistent and kid of the day I</p>
<p>started you know four years ago I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never cheated everyone and but if I do</p>
<p>have like you or Christmas I&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>like an extra meal I&rsquo;ll get some like</p>
<p>hard cheese and some bacon salami I will</p>
<p>have maybe three times a year I will</p>
<p>have maybe two meals but they&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>weird part about that is I don&rsquo;t feel so</p>
<p>good but I&rsquo;m just trying to you know do</p>
<p>a little extra I actually do better on</p>
<p>the one meal a day and you know I just</p>
<p>went to Thailand for a month and I flew</p>
<p>it was like basically 30 hours flying I</p>
<p>went three days without eating and on</p>
<p>the plane they&rsquo;re just like shoving food</p>
<p>in your face and I would just give it to</p>
<p>the guy beside me hating one extra meal</p>
<p>but and I was fine I was calm you know I</p>
<p>was you know eight hour layover in the</p>
<p>airport getting sleep for like 50 hours</p>
<p>and ended up being and I was still great</p>
<p>like so once you get yourself in and you</p>
<p>stay on point with bannerman fasting I</p>
<p>think that has been like my biggest</p>
<p>secret cuz I told you that when I was</p>
<p>stalling out near the end of my keto and</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t quite losing that weight it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when I switched that one meal a day</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when I shot down that that hard</p>
<p>last bit of weight that everybody talks</p>
<p>about</p>
<p>it was Manomet fasting and I started</p>
<p>that inmates been two years now two</p>
<p>years in a bed and I had never looked</p>
<p>back like like I swear by it I try and</p>
<p>convince a lot of people that is the way</p>
<p>to go but they all think I&rsquo;m a little</p>
<p>crazy really like oh you&rsquo;re in the</p>
<p>stress of but I said you have to do that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re for our you know but I&rsquo;ll tell</p>
<p>you the secret for mine and I&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>felt better I&rsquo;ve never been more</p>
<p>satisfied I don&rsquo;t even think about food</p>
<p>like you know the only reason that I</p>
<p>only have four tonight is because I kind</p>
<p>of need a little bit I&rsquo;m it&rsquo;s time that</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t realize and keep on a steady</p>
<p>plan but it&rsquo;s an amazing thing if you</p>
<p>can just stick with it it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>willpower and once you get into that</p>
<p>routine you know like I told you I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been heavy my whole life I have never</p>
<p>felt better in my life you know at 48</p>
<p>years old I have never been in better</p>
<p>mental clarity I&rsquo;ve never slept better</p>
<p>you know cardio everything and then I</p>
<p>get stumped down every day the</p>
<p>difference now is I get through my day</p>
<p>like I get stuff done I remember stuff</p>
<p>like just the whole way life functions</p>
<p>compared to I was before</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s pretty amazing so so um</p>
<p>those people are watching they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>want to know you have you have actual</p>
<p>physical cravings and then you have the</p>
<p>mental pressures of this or social</p>
<p>pressures of people around you that</p>
<p>keeps trying to put food on you how do</p>
<p>you do well I know that I already know</p>
<p>the answer that you you you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>anymore cravings so that helps right</p>
<p>number one well I do a lot of social</p>
<p>situations and I get this all the time</p>
<p>and like I was just in Thailand for a</p>
<p>month and over in Thailand food is like</p>
<p>huge there everybody is attracted to PG</p>
<p>they try to do it I just tell them I</p>
<p>only once a day they think I&rsquo;m crazy so</p>
<p>then you kind of explained to them and</p>
<p>they understand and then what they</p>
<p>really tried you to try and accommodate</p>
<p>you because over in Thailand they cook</p>
<p>with a lot of sugar so I tell him order</p>
<p>without sugar</p>
<p>give me some dark vegetables you know</p>
<p>and I was having pork with you know</p>
<p>broccoli mint so anywhere you go in a</p>
<p>social situation you can still do keto</p>
<p>you just got to ask some questions and</p>
<p>do it I do a lot of business meetings</p>
<p>where people go out for lunch what I I</p>
<p>just have a Diet Coke or I have a team</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sitting there drinking it was</p>
<p>like well I feel bad that you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>eating I&rsquo;m like well no don&rsquo;t feel bad</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m funny that you guys enjoy your meal</p>
<p>mmm you know and then a lot of times if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a really kind of cool dessert</p>
<p>that I like that I think I would like to</p>
<p>taste I actually buy for a friend of</p>
<p>mine I say here I&rsquo;ll buy you that you</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t tell me how it looks you know</p>
<p>just for a joke because if the situation</p>
<p>comes where they&rsquo;re kind of pressuring</p>
<p>you I turn it around on them and I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>buy them something I see you didn&rsquo;t tell</p>
<p>me how it is but you know so I kind of</p>
<p>played a game it doesn&rsquo;t bother me but I</p>
<p>hear that so much like so many people</p>
<p>does I&rsquo;ve been doing your videos dr.</p>
<p>Berg they&rsquo;ve reached out to me on</p>
<p>Facebook like I mean a lot how do I do</p>
<p>this or not I&rsquo;ve tried to help quite a</p>
<p>bit of people out but it&rsquo;s the willpower</p>
<p>and they do good for a couple weeks and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like almost family since I have</p>
<p>to do this or my work and all my not to</p>
<p>eat then they drop off and then they</p>
<p>have one meal few meals and then they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right back to where they are they cannot</p>
<p>consistently stick with it and it always</p>
<p>seems to come</p>
<p>well my friends at half-speed or my</p>
<p>parents happy or my family says they</p>
<p>have to eat and then they jump off and</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re gone they don&rsquo;t give it</p>
<p>time to actually stick together a plan</p>
<p>and get there you don&rsquo;t have to you can</p>
<p>have a drink you can still be social</p>
<p>there is nothing in life where says the</p>
<p>UFT because somebody else is meeting and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in tons of situations in that</p>
<p>situation I&rsquo;ve never ate why did he want</p>
<p>today at night wow I&rsquo;m in the same boat</p>
<p>you know like there&rsquo;s so many people</p>
<p>around me that are you gonna drinking or</p>
<p>eating and I&rsquo;m just on the guy on the</p>
<p>side just looking at them their stomachs</p>
<p>busting out I can say no that a fatty</p>
<p>liver they just don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>understanding and then eventually they</p>
<p>come onboard because they watch my</p>
<p>videos and of course you know it&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>to it&rsquo;s hard to you know like like I</p>
<p>have the intention one to help everyone</p>
<p>but they have to be ready to have to be</p>
<p>willing to be helped but you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such a strong thing culturally</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just like it&rsquo;s all about food you</p>
<p>have to feed people it&rsquo;s a social thing</p>
<p>but yeah I&rsquo;ll just honestly get to the</p>
<p>point where I don&rsquo;t really care right</p>
<p>now</p>
<p>about a funding finding something if I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t eat because it&rsquo;s my body I feel</p>
<p>like crap after so I&rsquo;m like no I&rsquo;m good</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling great and I&rsquo;m not hungry and</p>
<p>whatever I&rsquo;m you know I got a break</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s it you want it is it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>weird people want to know how I went</p>
<p>from 610 pounds and I honestly didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know I did this when I was six ten and</p>
<p>then in two years I was watching some of</p>
<p>your success story that&rsquo;s how I kind of</p>
<p>got on this I weighed myself I never</p>
<p>really weighed myself that much when I</p>
<p>was losing the weight when I started I</p>
<p>just started losing the weight and</p>
<p>everyone asked me oh you must feel so</p>
<p>much better</p>
<p>well tell you the truth I started on</p>
<p>October 6th every day just got a little</p>
<p>bit easier so by the time I was done two</p>
<p>years later October 6 and I weighed</p>
<p>myself I was like oh god I&rsquo;m down that</p>
<p>much I saw your success stories they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>down 60 pounds 80 pounds that&rsquo;s why I</p>
<p>reached out to you and said well I did</p>
<p>better in that in two years it never</p>
<p>really dawned on me because I just took</p>
<p>it a day at a time every day got just a</p>
<p>little bit easier too little</p>
<p>a little bit easier and before you</p>
<p>nobody should stick with it and you just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have that extra bit like I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do anything different like I never hired</p>
<p>no doctors I never hired no products I</p>
<p>just ain&rsquo;t natural food it costs me</p>
<p>nothing just what I would eat normally</p>
<p>and in two years I lost it and now since</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;ve been following your system</p>
<p>with intermittent fasting to me is a</p>
<p>miracle I just think it&rsquo;s the most</p>
<p>amazing thing I&rsquo;ve been doing it for two</p>
<p>years non-stop and that is where if</p>
<p>people really want to have good health</p>
<p>and a good life and a live - they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>probably longer that is the secret but</p>
<p>it takes a little bit of dedication it</p>
<p>takes a little bit of work a little bit</p>
<p>understanding but you don&rsquo;t have to jump</p>
<p>into it right away to everybody you can</p>
<p>get down from you know we saw eight</p>
<p>hours - six hours to four hours two</p>
<p>hours and then if you can get down to</p>
<p>that one Ellen it&rsquo;s pretty amazing yeah</p>
<p>ya know so yeah let your body actually</p>
<p>tell you when to start to go more strict</p>
<p>and this this summit which is October</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sorry August 31st and September</p>
<p>first we have Thomas LRO&rsquo;s coming when I</p>
<p>came up with you so he you can get some</p>
<p>information from him because he&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>into the workouts in the body building</p>
<p>that and then we have to cardiologists</p>
<p>who are keyed up friendly which is going</p>
<p>to be quite exciting because you would</p>
<p>think all cardiologists are pushing the</p>
<p>low-fat thing it&rsquo;s not true and then</p>
<p>even dr. Mercola is coming he knows a</p>
<p>lot about health I respect all the</p>
<p>things that he&rsquo;s doing and you know he</p>
<p>got in trouble because he&rsquo;s like you</p>
<p>know talking the truth about certain</p>
<p>things sensitive subjects and he got</p>
<p>attacked many times but I really respect</p>
<p>what he&rsquo;s doing this there&rsquo;s several</p>
<p>other people coming so it&rsquo;ll be exciting</p>
<p>for us to be there and you to be there</p>
<p>again last how&rsquo;d you stand up last year</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll definitely have to have you stand</p>
<p>up this year - just to have give a shout</p>
<p>out to everyone because there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>people who came last year coming again</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like a whole group of people</p>
<p>that are just developing friendships and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s quite amazing</p>
<p>yeah anybody&rsquo;s there and they want to</p>
<p>come say hi to me come up to me ask me</p>
<p>some questions</p>
<p>there are a lot of them every chair on</p>
<p>Facebook I get probably five five to</p>
<p>seven a day I could imagine</p>
<p>all over the world and III don&rsquo;t mind</p>
<p>helping they don&rsquo;t you know some are</p>
<p>really good about it yeah you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a tough you know like you said like</p>
<p>people if they want the help I&rsquo;ll give</p>
<p>it to them yeah but some people you can</p>
<p>tell they&rsquo;re just a little in-between</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not a hundred percent like a</p>
<p>lot of us who have mental - but ya know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been a good year I&rsquo;m really looking</p>
<p>forward to the summit this year I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>actually my goal kind of succeeded I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>actually retiring at the end of October</p>
<p>over here and I&rsquo;m moving over I&rsquo;m moving</p>
<p>over to Thailand full-time so what Wow</p>
<p>yeah yeah so I&rsquo;m gonna try and set up a</p>
<p>little maybe help more people there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of expats over there and a lot of us</p>
<p>and over there quite a bit so I might</p>
<p>see what I can do over there on my</p>
<p>retirement you know a little bit to see</p>
<p>if I can help</p>
<p>yeah I guess your you&rsquo;ll be able to live</p>
<p>a little bit better for the from via the</p>
<p>dollar or taking the Canadian currency</p>
<p>converted over it&rsquo;s probably a little</p>
<p>bit better I would love to come to it I</p>
<p>would love to come down here as ona but</p>
<p>your dollar just kills us right now so</p>
<p>it hurts me so you know I&rsquo;m sorry about</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m trying to go over</p>
<p>yeah but Thailand you can you can get</p>
<p>some healthy food there I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like incredible healthy yeah</p>
<p>they got like fresh they got like get</p>
<p>this down the realtor my they&rsquo;re like a</p>
<p>fresh butcher</p>
<p>they have like fresh pork they have a</p>
<p>lot of pork their beefs with more money</p>
<p>cuz it comes from Australia but a lot of</p>
<p>pork chicken seafood great vegetables</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re a lot I&rsquo;m gonna walk to a lot of</p>
<p>the darker green you don&rsquo;t want broccoli</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t one thing that really bothers</p>
<p>me they don&rsquo;t have them they know on a</p>
<p>scale</p>
<p>nobody has finished or you have to grow</p>
<p>that yourself but they had a little bit</p>
<p>of spring mix but you just substituted</p>
<p>with broccoli and some of the other</p>
<p>vegetables but in there&rsquo;s great over</p>
<p>there no they got a great amount of food</p>
<p>but one thing ties you cook a lot with</p>
<p>is they dump the sugar on everyone in</p>
<p>addition like I mean just spoonful and</p>
<p>one thing I&rsquo;ve noticed over there since</p>
<p>been going there for quite a few years</p>
<p>is the population there&rsquo;s so much fast</p>
<p>food there now and a lot of the Thai</p>
<p>people are starting to get a little bit</p>
<p>bigger they never used to be that big</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re starting to see it in the city is</p>
<p>where a lot of the fast food in the</p>
<p>villages not</p>
<p>much but in the city do you see a lot of</p>
<p>that dog food you know and you see it</p>
<p>over like in a lot of those countries</p>
<p>over there once you start getting in</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re just difficult use do they</p>
<p>use msg and this is probably they do</p>
<p>some of the restaurants it&rsquo;s hard to</p>
<p>tell if they do because they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no log over there and yeah but</p>
<p>the big one over there it&rsquo;s Kentucky</p>
<p>Fried chicken&rsquo;s a really big it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>there for years</p>
<p>McDonald&rsquo;s is everywhere and people know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a treat for them to go out there</p>
<p>sit is it going to a nice Thai family</p>
<p>restaurant we get actually some healthy</p>
<p>food people think it&rsquo;s cool and fun to</p>
<p>go to option we have crappy food you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s a different culture but it you</p>
<p>know I know in America if you go to a</p>
<p>Thai Thai restaurant you&rsquo;re gonna get so</p>
<p>much msg it&rsquo;s gonna taste incredible but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna fill up with fluid and then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be hungry in one hour</p>
<p>because your blood Sugar&rsquo;s gonna come up</p>
<p>msg will increase insulin by 300% so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a pretty pretty potent stuff most</p>
<p>of the restaurants that we go over there</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re pretty wholesome like you get a</p>
<p>full plate of Thai food like sitting on</p>
<p>some that would cost us ten eleven bucks</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a buckle over there a buck forty</p>
<p>bucks twenty you can go out with ten</p>
<p>people have twenty-five percent of food</p>
<p>you could have like say six beer big</p>
<p>bottle of mineral water you know over</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s thirty cents you can do all that</p>
<p>for about fifty five dollars and we went</p>
<p>out quite a few nights with ten people</p>
<p>with all that food and we&rsquo;ve spent $55</p>
<p>KT which is like $30 American so the</p>
<p>incredible amount and like a Coke Zero</p>
<p>over there it can be here like a bottles</p>
<p>to 75 over there 20 cents - a big 1.5</p>
<p>liter of mineral water is 30 40 cents</p>
<p>over there so the food is really cheap</p>
<p>over there you know living expenses</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really cheap over there so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your good place or anything what the</p>
<p>best part is you really want it&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a great place to retire then that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>awesome</p>
<p>Pam yeah we&rsquo;ll come back I&rsquo;ll fly back</p>
<p>every year and we&rsquo;ll go to the</p>
<p>conference and summit I gotta we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna keep that up so yeah I tell you</p>
<p>what I mean last year wasn&rsquo;t weren&rsquo;t the</p>
<p>people just incredible I mean just</p>
<p>friendly gung-ho</p>
<p>into it I&rsquo;m like who are you guys okay</p>
<p>yeah I know what the best thing is after</p>
<p>the summit we&rsquo;re on the hotel together</p>
<p>there we would get like 10 15 of us all</p>
<p>together we would sit there talk and you</p>
<p>know asking about like what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>and the best thing I met a couple of</p>
<p>people there that they actually it was</p>
<p>one of the ladies I brought her two</p>
<p>nephews who never even heard about quito</p>
<p>but just for support so she brought her</p>
<p>nephew there&rsquo;s a lot of people like that</p>
<p>or the boyfriend of the girlfriend would</p>
<p>come but the people are there for</p>
<p>support then they learn what we&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>and then it kind of builds up the</p>
<p>community</p>
<p>yeah well you you know what I still see</p>
<p>is like you know I talked to you about</p>
<p>the doctor my doctor still says to me</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;ve done amazing but I</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t understand it we weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>taught this way</p>
<p>whatever you done it doesn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>to cardiology</p>
<p>everybody keeps coming is because they</p>
<p>know what I&rsquo;ve done now but they even</p>
<p>know how long it&rsquo;s been off I got only</p>
<p>blood work done you&rsquo;re like it does not</p>
<p>make sense to us we were never taught</p>
<p>this way and I don&rsquo;t know what to say to</p>
<p>you we just keep doing what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re doing great and so my</p>
<p>doctors like can you give me some</p>
<p>pictures and tell me kind of what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing in theirs so I gave him some</p>
<p>pictures so he&rsquo;s showing his client he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually on his own trying to do it and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s actually a lady here in Calgary</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s a doctor two reached out to me and</p>
<p>she wants to start doing keto for her</p>
<p>patients here but they&rsquo;re also new but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing like a a high-bred thing</p>
<p>in quito because they&rsquo;re still not a</p>
<p>hundred percent understanding how it</p>
<p>works the too scared to pull a hundred</p>
<p>percent of the glucose away but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>starting to open up Wow everything and</p>
<p>everything I&rsquo;ve been doing is I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>sending my blood worked out Dave and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s been taken I&rsquo;ve been trying to do a</p>
<p>study so I begin my blood work sending</p>
<p>it down to him you know just to show</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re sitting there so it you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s quite a nice community that we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>created here and the people that we met</p>
<p>you know and all the great work we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing it it&rsquo;s hard to convince people</p>
<p>though like I could you said you think</p>
<p>you if people want to learn I&rsquo;ll try and</p>
<p>teach them but when you try and teach</p>
<p>them they look at you then it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>this doesn&rsquo;t make sense it doesn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>sense I&rsquo;m like well here&rsquo;s links to this</p>
<p>video so I send them to your they send</p>
<p>it to everybody&rsquo;s length I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like well I think it&rsquo;s all fake</p>
<p>well I&rsquo;m like well you can believe what</p>
<p>you want</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m you know evidence you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>many people here that are evidence but</p>
<p>yeah I don&rsquo;t even I don&rsquo;t even get into</p>
<p>it anymore I just think given the</p>
<p>information that I don&rsquo;t walk away if</p>
<p>they want to come back to me and ask me</p>
<p>then I will that&rsquo;s kind of what my</p>
<p>theories been in the last year because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been so many people reaching out</p>
<p>to me and I don&rsquo;t actually tell them in</p>
<p>public I will wait until they ask me the</p>
<p>question or I&rsquo;ll kind of give them a</p>
<p>suggestion but I don&rsquo;t really want to go</p>
<p>on preached it because it&rsquo;s so hard with</p>
<p>people at Sun yeah it&rsquo;s a tough one they</p>
<p>want to learn I&rsquo;m here but if they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you know time we don&rsquo;t have time in the</p>
<p>day some days for all that stuff I know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a you you know about my lab my</p>
<p>keto lab um yeah probably on the</p>
<p>membership there cuz yeah probably a lot</p>
<p>of you lots of questions so I have a</p>
<p>keto an intimate that&rsquo;s keto an if&rsquo; lab</p>
<p>on Facebook if it&rsquo;s close group you you</p>
<p>have to apply and then we accept you in</p>
<p>there but I have so many people that are</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even know what keto is and they</p>
<p>are just learning I don&rsquo;t know where</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re coming from and they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s keto and so you got you can</p>
<p>imagine like I&rsquo;ve almost 300,000 people</p>
<p>just swarm in and kind of let me explain</p>
<p>what keto is but I think um I think that</p>
<p>the things are changing this is not a</p>
<p>fad it&rsquo;s because it works and anything</p>
<p>that works as well it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>continue so the weird there&rsquo;s a huge</p>
<p>push I think it&rsquo;s at one point four</p>
<p>trillion dollars in the food industry</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still carbohydrates so you have</p>
<p>a lot of money</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s aunt Aikido and they pretty much</p>
<p>own the news so you&rsquo;re gonna get a lot</p>
<p>of you know it&rsquo;s dangerous and shortens</p>
<p>your life span but the truth is that</p>
<p>because it works people will eventually</p>
<p>try it and they their work for them you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s like I get I mean I have so</p>
<p>many success stories on the site I have</p>
<p>I think close to 800 success stories 800</p>
<p>which is a lot we get like 10 a day and</p>
<p>so if someone scroll through and looks</p>
<p>at that they&rsquo;re gonna be like okay</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s must be something to this and we</p>
<p>try to keep it simple they try it works</p>
<p>your childhood friends so it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like a no brainer and the big thing of</p>
<p>Okita that people understand is you know</p>
<p>in the past I&rsquo;ve tried like you know the</p>
<p>Jenny Craig the diet centers all those</p>
<p>places you know a lot of these doctors</p>
<p>where they give you the vitamin me</p>
<p>that stuff cost a lot of money I&rsquo;ll tell</p>
<p>you Kido the only thing you need is you</p>
<p>need your supplements right we talked</p>
<p>about you need some of your zinc your</p>
<p>potassium that&rsquo;s what you got to buy but</p>
<p>everything else is just food out of a</p>
<p>supermarket and it&rsquo;s so cheap like I try</p>
<p>to tell people you do not have to change</p>
<p>anything you do you want to stay with me</p>
<p>for a week I&rsquo;ll show you how to eat and</p>
<p>if you tell me one thing of that&rsquo;s bad</p>
<p>and you couldn&rsquo;t stick with it then</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s obviously something wrong with</p>
<p>you there is a few people that are so</p>
<p>addicted to bread and carbs they think</p>
<p>they are but I said this let me come</p>
<p>with me for a week he would I do you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even remember it right you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to go and buy all this expensive</p>
<p>thing I have all this expensive advice</p>
<p>something you have to do is get</p>
<p>potassium magnesium tell me your</p>
<p>supplements we have because we know they</p>
<p>work for us and then maybe a little</p>
<p>electrolytes when you&rsquo;re fasting a long</p>
<p>time but everything else is natural food</p>
<p>you can handle them which is super cheap</p>
<p>you get pork is even cheaper you can</p>
<p>have pork it&rsquo;s even cheaper the</p>
<p>vegetables broccoli sheep you know</p>
<p>spinach kale it&rsquo;s all out there</p>
<p>eggs super cheap that&rsquo;s what you need</p>
<p>those are the staples of what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing and that&rsquo;s all you really need to</p>
<p>do keto</p>
<p>you do not have to go spend all this</p>
<p>money you can reverse your health you</p>
<p>can improve your life you can have</p>
<p>whatever you want the future by just</p>
<p>sticking to some simple things it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>pretty simple plan how much money you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna save just I&rsquo;m not eating snacks or</p>
<p>that you start doing intermittent</p>
<p>fasting you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re you guys save at</p>
<p>the very minimum 400 a month up to 600</p>
<p>month just from cutting down different</p>
<p>things so you know it&rsquo;s you can&rsquo;t use</p>
<p>that as an excuse like oh it&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>expensive it&rsquo;s not no need pre-drinking</p>
<p>foods right quit drinking you gonna</p>
<p>drink water like you know mineral water</p>
<p>like what I do is I get a really big pot</p>
<p>and yeah let&rsquo;s order it can mineral</p>
<p>water that&rsquo;s why tell me</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t drink reverse osmosis if you can</p>
<p>find it I&rsquo;ve been really trying to</p>
<p>educate on my friends do not have RO</p>
<p>water</p>
<p>terrible for you I try to commit their</p>
<p>way to mineral water that&rsquo;s what you got</p>
<p>to have so but at the end of the day</p>
<p>what I do for like our flavors I get a</p>
<p>really big pot like it&rsquo;s spaghetti pot i</p>
<p>cook a bunch of tea in there i add</p>
<p>organic lemon and since the TV</p>
<p>and I just have like four big jugs like</p>
<p>in jug I just have iced tea I make it</p>
<p>myself it&rsquo;s super cheap it tastes great</p>
<p>so at the end of the day you can have it</p>
<p>and I do have a diet coke right when I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>out in the social situation people are</p>
<p>drinking when I&rsquo;m at a bar all of their</p>
<p>diet coconut it doesn&rsquo;t bother you at</p>
<p>the end the day you know so you can</p>
<p>still have pretending you&rsquo;re drinking</p>
<p>something to like you know get everybody</p>
<p>off your back you just got to make sure</p>
<p>when you order you have to say three</p>
<p>times it&rsquo;s a diet coke is it&rsquo;s a bad</p>
<p>coke because people like to give you</p>
<p>sugar but at the end of the day you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all these solutions you can have</p>
<p>a keto is basically if you&rsquo;re on a</p>
<p>really low income you could still do</p>
<p>keto because I&rsquo;ll tell you</p>
<p>pork roast beef I mean whatever it is</p>
<p>like hamburgers cheap eggs are cheap you</p>
<p>can get some spinach that is cheap if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t can&rsquo;t afford your organic and</p>
<p>just buy the regular you know but you</p>
<p>can still do you go buy broccoli or you</p>
<p>can have your own garden and make it on</p>
<p>broccoli make your own Cal make your own</p>
<p>spinach and it&rsquo;s free and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably what cost me the most money is</p>
<p>buying the salads every day that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>most expensive every month this is guys</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t afford the inexpensive</p>
<p>things they talked about then you need</p>
<p>to get another job okay still can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>afford it you need to find a job that</p>
<p>pays you at least to cook because we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking like at the very most $10 a day</p>
<p>very much and you do you what the</p>
<p>biggest thing okay so a lot of these</p>
<p>people were talking about that are type</p>
<p>2 diabetes they&rsquo;re on medication</p>
<p>I swear within a month I drop my</p>
<p>medication that I was on I was six</p>
<p>hundred pounds I dropped you know all my</p>
<p>medication which cost a lot of money so</p>
<p>if you just get on this and stay on keto</p>
<p>you will drop those expensive drugs that</p>
<p>you have so there you&rsquo;re saving money</p>
<p>right there I know your guys in health</p>
<p>care isn&rsquo;t that cheap you know and drugs</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t that cheap so if you just can get</p>
<p>on Aikido within two months if we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>under your doctor&rsquo;s supervision you</p>
<p>should be able to drop off like your</p>
<p>blood Sugar&rsquo;s to be in control you</p>
<p>should get off statins you should get</p>
<p>off your blood your cholesterol medicine</p>
<p>the shuttle drop if you stay on it do it</p>
<p>right so you save money on your</p>
<p>medication you save money on your food</p>
<p>and then you can get into internet</p>
<p>fasting then you really start to say one</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s no excuse from anybody and</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;m a busy guy you know we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>all busy we travel I travel a lot</p>
<p>and I you know I eat out but you can</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re eating out you order a</p>
<p>hamburger with an avocado slight bacon</p>
<p>cheese and a Caesar salad a small one or</p>
<p>no croutons there you go you have eggs</p>
<p>we order a hamburger with an egg or the</p>
<p>block with butter on the side always</p>
<p>order your sauce on the side put it on</p>
<p>yourself it&rsquo;s so easy to go to a</p>
<p>supermarket grab stuff yeah I was in</p>
<p>Bangkok I couldn&rsquo;t talk Thai and I</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t really go to a restaurant so I</p>
<p>just went to a supermarket</p>
<p>I bought some Gouda cheese and so I mean</p>
<p>I bought a little salad kind of made a</p>
<p>little roll myself and I eat that at the</p>
<p>end of the day no matter where you are</p>
<p>you can find through that&rsquo;s on keto and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very simple to do and once you get</p>
<p>in there Matassa thing just don&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>that if you can do you have to skip a</p>
<p>day and one hurts you it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>healthier for you and you&rsquo;ve done the</p>
<p>automatic yeah it&rsquo;s awesome Thank You</p>
