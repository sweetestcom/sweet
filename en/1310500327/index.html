    <p>Once this whole thing falls apart</p>
<p>and we are climbing the kudzu vines</p>
<p>that spiral up the Sears Tower,</p>
<p>like they say in Fight Club,</p>
<p>Bobby will go back to his gatherer form</p>
<p>and be happy as a pig in shit,</p>
<p>just walking around in a loincloth</p>
<p>with his bird hanging out,</p>
<p>tracking jokes to people and climbing up on them</p>
<p>for a stool lap dance or whatever he does.</p>
<p>Do you think some level of crazy is required for comedy?</p>
<p>Like, at some point?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Have there been low points in your life?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know, hey, hey.</p>
<p>Eh?</p>
<p>Ha ha ha ha.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Will Sasso,</p>
<p>a comedian, actor, podcaster,</p>
<p>and someone I&rsquo;ve been a fan of for many years</p>
<p>since Mad TV in the late 90s</p>
<p>to recently with the 10 Minute Podcast</p>
<p>and now the new podcast called Doodzee.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Will Sasso.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s call out the elephant in the room.</p>
<p>You wore a black suit in a recent episode of Doodzee.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You wore a black suit again today.</p>
<p>Shakespeare, then Mark Twain, said clothes make the man.</p>
<p>What kind of man does a suit make you?</p>
<p>Well, me in particular, it makes me a fellow</p>
<p>who did not get this dry cleaned in between</p>
<p>because that episode of the show as we sit here now</p>
<p>was around a week ago.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the kind of man it makes me.</p>
<p>Well, the nice thing is you&rsquo;re wearing pants, I think.</p>
<p>Yes, I am wearing pants.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you were wearing pants in the episode.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>I prefer to wear shorts, but this was a special occasion</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m wearing pants and I thought it fitting, obviously,</p>
<p>to just wear the black tie.</p>
<p>And clothes do make the man.</p>
<p>And I would not consider myself to be a man of leisure,</p>
<p>but I do enjoy shorts because my legs get hot.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what kind of man the shorts make me.</p>
<p>How often do you wear a suit?</p>
<p>I fucking hate wearing suits.</p>
<p>So what is this, a statement of, is it ironic?</p>
<p>Or are you honoring the gods of this particular podcast?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m honoring the gods of this particular podcast</p>
<p>would be a good way to put it.</p>
<p>Yes, no, this is in reverence of and in dedication to you</p>
<p>and our newfound friendship here,</p>
<p>which we are making on the podcast.</p>
<p>You and I just met.</p>
<p>Everything that we&rsquo;re saying here</p>
<p>is the first things that we&rsquo;re saying to each other.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m meeting you on common ground dressed like.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve been actually a one way friend of yours</p>
<p>for many, many years since Mad TV.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>When did you start on Mad TV?</p>
<p>So that was, I mean, in 90s?</p>
<p>97, yeah.</p>
<p>97.</p>
<p>So I was a huge fan of yours and the cast was incredible.</p>
<p>It was one of the funniest shows ever created.</p>
<p>Your whole journey watching through that</p>
<p>was incredible from Mad TV to Three Stooges</p>
<p>to the podcasts, the 10 Minute Pod</p>
<p>and then the new podcast is incredible.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<p>My favorite role that you played</p>
<p>was the mountain in the Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>What was it like working with dragons?</p>
<p>Well, the dragons are usually tennis balls</p>
<p>on the end of C stands, but sometimes they hang out.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a C stand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, it&rsquo;s like a little,</p>
<p>like the thing you got the camera on here.</p>
<p>Oh, this is like film lingo.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I understand.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to impress you with my film lingo.</p>
<p>You know what a banana is?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when you walk like this.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Do a banana.</p>
<p>I take it back.</p>
<p>I did not know what a banana was.</p>
<p>Yeah, see?</p>
<p>I misunderstood.</p>
<p>Yeah, cause it&rsquo;s just a food.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Normally.</p>
<p>You fancy Hollywood folk with a lingo.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m, my name is Bjorn Hapthor Bjornsson</p>
<p>and I am seven foot four and yeah.</p>
<p>So dragons don&rsquo;t, dragons don&rsquo;t scare me</p>
<p>even though they&rsquo;ve been extinct for a while.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a scientist, right?</p>
<p>Is that checkout?</p>
<p>Yeah, I actually, I&rsquo;m really into video games.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you play video games.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s a Skyrim video game</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s part of the Elder Scrolls series.</p>
<p>And for the longest time,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a legend that there&rsquo;s dragons.</p>
<p>I think it started in Daggerfall.</p>
<p>And so I always, I grew up playing those video games</p>
<p>and dreaming of one day meeting a dragon in a virtual world.</p>
<p>And eventually you did in Skyrim.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, dragons represent,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly what they represent,</p>
<p>but they represent maybe this kind of mythical creature</p>
<p>that is bigger than anything humans</p>
<p>can possibly comprehend maybe.</p>
<p>Cause they&rsquo;re so, they&rsquo;re so, they show up so often in myth</p>
<p>from the, from the religious stories, you know,</p>
<p>of the snake and so on, the serpent.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what that is.</p>
<p>Well, this breathing fire, that&rsquo;s kind of weird.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting when I think about dragons,</p>
<p>cause now that you bring it up,</p>
<p>these are people that probably wouldn&rsquo;t have access</p>
<p>to the fact that there used to be dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Maybe they did.</p>
<p>If they didn&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;re drawing things that look like,</p>
<p>you know, a dinosaur cousin, but cool,</p>
<p>that can breathe fire and has wacky wings and a spiked tail.</p>
<p>Yeah, where the heck did they come up with that?</p>
<p>Cause they&rsquo;re clearly of course represented in mythology</p>
<p>all the way back to, no, not cave drawings.</p>
<p>Well, the Egyptians probably knew what the,</p>
<p>and they could time travel.</p>
<p>So they would have gone back to the caves.</p>
<p>Well, the aliens that placed living organisms on earth</p>
<p>could time travel and they could plant legends</p>
<p>into the, into the collective intelligence</p>
<p>of the human species.</p>
<p>Yeah, and perhaps they were thinking of us</p>
<p>to do something smart with it.</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t, we just came up with the sky.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just, what&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>Sorry, that was very offensive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, I don&rsquo;t mean to offend you with your video game.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more of a burger time Donkey Kong dude.</p>
<p>Oh, what is that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an original.</p>
<p>Burger time was an arcade game that later showed up</p>
<p>on the Intellivision, it was Intellivision.</p>
<p>I believe it was made by Texas Instruments,</p>
<p>horrible first generation video game console.</p>
<p>And burger time, you just, it&rsquo;s like Super Mario.</p>
<p>You just got to stay away from the eggs</p>
<p>and the pickles and stuff.</p>
<p>And you just go, and the bun falls.</p>
<p>And then you go down to the and the cheese and then the meat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to say it&rsquo;s as complicated</p>
<p>as Skyrim, but took me a while to finish it when I was seven.</p>
<p>Did you play video games, was that a part of your life,</p>
<p>a part of the source of happiness for you at all?</p>
<p>It was, it was.</p>
<p>I played video games up until around, I think in 2010,</p>
<p>I got the Red Ring of Death on my Xbox 360.</p>
<p>That was it?</p>
<p>That was it.</p>
<p>I never, or whatever the Xbox was then.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I had, I was playing, I had finished the Grand Theft Auto</p>
<p>that was out and finished the Red Dead Redemption.</p>
<p>So I was doing that thing where you just drive around,</p>
<p>you know, the streets of New York or just ride around</p>
<p>on your horse shooting people and, you know,</p>
<p>throwing grenades into groups of people in Grand Theft.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re describing the same thing that happened</p>
<p>a decade later, because it&rsquo;s now Red Dead Redemption 2</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s still not a new Grand Theft Auto, so.</p>
<p>Yeah, there isn&rsquo;t, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re working on it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re always flirting with that idea.</p>
<p>You know who else plays Skyrim?</p>
<p>Another person, the two people I&rsquo;m a huge fan of</p>
<p>from that time in Matt TV is Bobby Lee.</p>
<p>He plays Skyrim?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a huge fan of Skyrim.</p>
<p>He plays every.</p>
<p>So what Bobby Lee loves to do is to grind,</p>
<p>do the boring task over and over, gather mushrooms.</p>
<p>Like in Skyrim, you can fight dragons,</p>
<p>you can fight all kinds of things,</p>
<p>but you can also gather mushrooms and different ingredients</p>
<p>to make potions and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>He loves the ingredients.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the, you know, in the hunter gatherer world,</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the gatherer.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve heard him described that way</p>
<p>and he likes to describe himself that way.</p>
<p>I worked with Bobby not too long ago.</p>
<p>He came and did a couple days on this thing we were shooting</p>
<p>and I was looking forward to catching up with my old pal.</p>
<p>And if you know anything about Bobby Lee,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d probably be able to predict that he spent</p>
<p>that entire time playing farming on his iPad.</p>
<p>Well, humans are a source of anxiety and trouble,</p>
<p>so sometimes it&rsquo;s good to escape human interaction</p>
<p>through video games.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with him on that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the funniest people ever.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>What do you think makes him funny?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just all the times you&rsquo;ve worked with him,</p>
<p>the nonstandard, nonsecular way of his being.</p>
<p>Bobby Lee is one of the most raw people,</p>
<p>raw performers who lets it all hang out</p>
<p>to the degree that he will even get naked</p>
<p>in front of his audience,</p>
<p>which is usually a metaphor for someone doing standup.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m bearing all, I&rsquo;m showing you everything,</p>
<p>and Bobby will just pull his bird out of his pants.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think he understands metaphor too much.</p>
<p>He embodies metaphor.</p>
<p>Yes, he embodies metaphor.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the gatherer, we call him the gathering metaphor.</p>
<p>Bobby the gatherer metaphor.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a metaphor for something else,</p>
<p>for somebody else&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Someday he&rsquo;ll be in the dictionary</p>
<p>representing some kind of concept,</p>
<p>maybe the metaphor itself.</p>
<p>Yeah, once this whole thing falls apart</p>
<p>and we are climbing the kudzu vines</p>
<p>that spiral up the Sears Tower,</p>
<p>like they say in Fight Club,</p>
<p>Bobby will go back to his gatherer form</p>
<p>and be happy as a pig in shit,</p>
<p>just walking around in a loincloth</p>
<p>with his bird hanging out,</p>
<p>tracking jokes to people and climbing up on them</p>
<p>for a stool lap dance or whatever he does.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to dig into something he did.</p>
<p>You guys did a lot of great podcasts together.</p>
<p>He asked you in a very uncomfortable process</p>
<p>of why you don&rsquo;t do standup.</p>
<p>So let me ask you, do you hate money?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m originally from Canada, yeah.</p>
<p>So yeah, I&rsquo;m a fricking pinko socialist.</p>
<p>Is that where you come from?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a nice thing to say.</p>
<p>I thought the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>that is a nice thing to say.</p>
<p>Like comrade, he&rsquo;s a good socialist with red,</p>
<p>like some bold colors, yeah.</p>
<p>There was an interesting tension in your voice</p>
<p>and the way you talked about it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just not a source of happiness for you.</p>
<p>You respect the art form,</p>
<p>but it was not something that you were connected to,</p>
<p>you felt connected to.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good way to put it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I respect the art form a lot.</p>
<p>And I grew up with all the albums and stuff.</p>
<p>I had an older brother and sister who,</p>
<p>so we had George Carlin, we had Richard Pryor,</p>
<p>we had Robert Klein, we had Gilda Live,</p>
<p>the Gilda Radner concert, we had all sorts of stuff.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know, there&rsquo;s a lot of reasons.</p>
<p>I do feel like a career in show business</p>
<p>is it never goes the way you plan, like most things.</p>
<p>And I was fortunate enough to get started</p>
<p>outside of my native Vancouver or in my native Vancouver.</p>
<p>I grew up in the burbs outside</p>
<p>and there was a lot of industry there.</p>
<p>So I was fortunate enough to get started as an actor</p>
<p>when I was like 16.</p>
<p>So yeah, there were some times early on</p>
<p>where I came up with some standup stuff and did it,</p>
<p>but yeah, I quickly abandoned it.</p>
<p>And then you go through, you do Mad TV and stuff,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where my, and this is gonna sound weird.</p>
<p>Do I sound as anxiety as I did when I was on Bobby&rsquo;s podcast</p>
<p>trying to avoid his questions?</p>
<p>Well, he was giving you this face this whole time</p>
<p>that was making the whole just atmosphere feel</p>
<p>full of anxiety.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m trying not to give you a face.</p>
<p>The whole time I was saying, play cool, play cool.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>Play cool, Lex.</p>
<p>Play cool.</p>
<p>You said it out loud a couple of times.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>Just, you know, you cut that out.</p>
<p>Play cool.</p>
<p>Play cool, dude.</p>
<p>Cut out, cut it out.</p>
<p>Maintain, bro.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll say.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two ways to do it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s lame when someone who&rsquo;s done one thing</p>
<p>for a while goes and starts doing standup out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Cause I think it&rsquo;s an art form that&rsquo;s under attack</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not like anything else.</p>
<p>You need, although now you can of course,</p>
<p>you know, make whatever you want.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the era of self publishing as far as making a product</p>
<p>and putting it out there, which is getting easier,</p>
<p>of course, and I can&rsquo;t wait to talk to you about that</p>
<p>with AI and how it&rsquo;s changing art.</p>
<p>But in standup, all you need is a microphone</p>
<p>and you know, perhaps it&rsquo;d be good</p>
<p>to have some mental illness</p>
<p>and then you can just run up there and talk forever.</p>
<p>And I say this to, you know, comedians.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you guys have to deal with just</p>
<p>an influx of people who aren&rsquo;t sure</p>
<p>why they&rsquo;re doing comedy.</p>
<p>I would ask comedians, I mean, not good ones,</p>
<p>good ones, you know what they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>but everyone else like, what are you doing?</p>
<p>Why, why are you doing standup?</p>
<p>Having said that, I am allergic to money.</p>
<p>Yeah, do you think they have a good answer for that?</p>
<p>Why are they doing it?</p>
<p>Cause I actually like when I&rsquo;m in Austin,</p>
<p>I like going to open mics, just listening.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s inspiring to me, both the funny and the unfunny people</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve been doing it for several years.</p>
<p>Sometimes over a decade and they&rsquo;re still at it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still right there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going for the punch and then especially open mics</p>
<p>that are really sad in that there&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>only like five other people in the audience</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re usually just other comedians</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re still going all out</p>
<p>as if they&rsquo;re in front of a stadium.</p>
<p>But that to me sounds like someone who loves it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I got no questions for that person.</p>
<p>I got questions for someone who goes sideways</p>
<p>from here I&rsquo;m recognizable doing something</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m doing standup because it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>and truly look, I&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough</p>
<p>to be in the business for a long time</p>
<p>and at this point, if I came up,</p>
<p>I mean, doing live stuff is fun.</p>
<p>I have friends that are like, you know,</p>
<p>some guys who are primarily sketch people</p>
<p>or you would look at them as sketch people</p>
<p>and they can sell tickets for being sketch people</p>
<p>and they, and we&rsquo;ll talk about it.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, you know, I do a monologue</p>
<p>and I do a little standup, then I do a song,</p>
<p>then I do another monologue, then I play off the audience,</p>
<p>do a little standup, but standup is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like playing music in that,</p>
<p>you know, people are going up there playing music,</p>
<p>but what band have you been listening to?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re gonna sound like.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really, I mean, of course,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speaking from zero experience,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve heard it takes years, of course,</p>
<p>to find your own voice.</p>
<p>Standups that when they first go up,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing some sort of impersonation of so and so</p>
<p>and so and so, and then you gotta pop this audience</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s paying and you&rsquo;re gonna get run over</p>
<p>by the next person who&rsquo;s coming up</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hard to follow the last person</p>
<p>who went up before you.</p>
<p>And I mean, that is a really hard way to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very, it&rsquo;s quite a gauntlet</p>
<p>to be in to find your voice comedically.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you have that same kind of thing with sketch?</p>
<p>Where you still have to find your own voice</p>
<p>with like all the impressions you do,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just terrible, you know,</p>
<p>there are different spins and different people,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not like perfect impressions, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, I mean, that&rsquo;s a similar kind of challenge</p>
<p>and journey as standup.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just saying they&rsquo;re kind of distinct</p>
<p>and you fell into this one and you fell in love with it,</p>
<p>which is like what Mad TV kind of opened you up to.</p>
<p>Yeah, as a kid, I literally wanted to be an actor.</p>
<p>I always wanted to be an actor from a very young age,</p>
<p>as far back as I can remember,</p>
<p>and I was the class clown and wanted to do comedy stuff</p>
<p>and comedic acting and so on.</p>
<p>So comedic acting.</p>
<p>Yeah, early on, my influences were a very predictable list</p>
<p>of guys from SCTV, Early Saturday Night Live, Monty Python,</p>
<p>all of those performers really influenced me.</p>
<p>It was later that I saw people like Kevin Kline,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s an incredible actor.</p>
<p>I vividly remember being like 12, 13,</p>
<p>seeing him get an Academy Award for Fish Called Wanda.</p>
<p>And it blew my mind, because I was like, he was hilarious.</p>
<p>I mean, it was one of my favorite movies back then and now.</p>
<p>And he won an Academy Award.</p>
<p>And at that point, I started thinking more about acting.</p>
<p>And then I was, like I said, really fortunate</p>
<p>to fall in with, I mean, I always wanted to do it</p>
<p>and I was trying to hustle this and that when I was a kid.</p>
<p>And then I ended up getting represented.</p>
<p>And then I ended up on a teen show.</p>
<p>I was on, basically, the easiest way to pitch it</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s like a Canadian, my so called life</p>
<p>with these kids and their lives and stuff.</p>
<p>And I did that for like five years and I really love acting.</p>
<p>I really, truly love acting.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not someone who wants people to know my opinion.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another thing about standup.</p>
<p>Like I love the illusion of what I get to do</p>
<p>in entertainment and podcasting is great for that.</p>
<p>But to stand up there and, I don&rsquo;t know, just for me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it would have to all be fantasy.</p>
<p>Yeah, so Nietzsche said that every profound spirit</p>
<p>needs a mask.</p>
<p>Like you said, you don&rsquo;t like to talk about,</p>
<p>in your comedy, you don&rsquo;t like to talk about stuff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s personal to you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>If you were to psychoanalyze yourself,</p>
<p>do you think it&rsquo;s just not something you find funny</p>
<p>or are you running from something and it&rsquo;s not your fault?</p>
<p>Will.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not your fault, Will.</p>
<p>Speaking of another really great comedic actor</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s also a serious actor, Robin Williams.</p>
<p>One of the best serious actors.</p>
<p>I mean, and one of the funniest people of all time,</p>
<p>but as great, as incredible as he was as a funny man,</p>
<p>as a standup and a performer,</p>
<p>I almost like his serious stuff better.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a question about that?</p>
<p>What do you make of the, that he committed suicide?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, I mean, it&rsquo;s super depressing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve referred to him as like the Jesus Christ of depression.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like he died for others depression.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d look at someone like that and go,</p>
<p>wait a minute, you&rsquo;re a rockstar.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t, you could just check out</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not liking your life.</p>
<p>And of course, something like suicide</p>
<p>begs that you look a little deeper</p>
<p>and realize how tortured the human mind can make someone.</p>
<p>Is there some aspect to, you know, we&rsquo;re in LA.</p>
<p>Is there some aspect of celebrity that is isolating</p>
<p>that can make you feel really lonely?</p>
<p>Not me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel, no, not really.</p>
<p>You feel the love?</p>
<p>No, I just feel like I&rsquo;m not, I mean, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;ve always kind of had a small group</p>
<p>of friends and those people don&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;ve known the same people for years and years.</p>
<p>You never really felt the celebrity really.</p>
<p>Nah, in LA, it&rsquo;s hard to, it&rsquo;s hard for people.</p>
<p>Nobody cares.</p>
<p>They see you and then the next minute they see so and so.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, you know, I&rsquo;m the guy from that.</p>
<p>Mike and Molly, right?</p>
<p>Nope, nope.</p>
<p>Close.</p>
<p>King of, you shave your head, you go bald.</p>
<p>Are you King of Queens?</p>
<p>Nope, that&rsquo;s not me.</p>
<p>So close.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re wow, shit, you used to be the mountain</p>
<p>on Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>You look like shit, what happened?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been just eating fried dough?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s up.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t lift any weights anymore.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at the gym doing like 15 pounds with shoulder press.</p>
<p>Ah, and people coming up to me.</p>
<p>You used to be a dragon killer, dude.</p>
<p>Half the man you used to be.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s, have there been low points in your life?</p>
<p>Sorry to go there, but.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, hey.</p>
<p>Eh?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s, everybody has a low point in life.</p>
<p>The operative.</p>
<p>Do you suffer from like depression</p>
<p>and any of those kinds of things?</p>
<p>You know what, I do.</p>
<p>I do, I have a bunch of stuff.</p>
<p>How do you deal with it?</p>
<p>Said friends?</p>
<p>The friends and the.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t do anything for me in that sense.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I have an incredible fiance who,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s nice to have somebody constant</p>
<p>that you love very much and see as the best person</p>
<p>and all that good stuff.</p>
<p>Hopefully, vice versa.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>Well, on your recent Instagram,</p>
<p>she said that she loves you, so.</p>
<p>Wow, you were.</p>
<p>At least allegedly.</p>
<p>Just on, yeah, allegedly.</p>
<p>That might all be for, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>How much money did you pay her to say that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any, because I&rsquo;m not a stand up.</p>
<p>I was like, I can do, you got Venmo?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I got, I only have like $123.</p>
<p>I can give you some Dogecoin.</p>
<p>Yeah, some Doge.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You got, you want some Doge?</p>
<p>I got some of those monkey NFTs.</p>
<p>Oh, before I forget.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Put a dudesie sticker on your microphone if that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Here.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Now, these are tricky,</p>
<p>because I have the thumbs of a,</p>
<p>I have like Italian sausage thumbs.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t wait and watch this happen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna.</p>
<p>This will take another.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>Yeah, ooh, this is embarrassing.</p>
<p>When this, are you good under pressure?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I have anxiety.</p>
<p>I have performance anxiety.</p>
<p>Do you have anxiety?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You have anxiety, period?</p>
<p>Period.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I, I.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t like it when I,</p>
<p>if I have to pee and then everyone&rsquo;s waiting</p>
<p>in the urinals.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>You know what&rsquo;ll help you in that situation?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>Taking a shit.</p>
<p>Because whenever you take a shit,</p>
<p>you always pee a little.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to take a shit while you&rsquo;re standing at a urinal,</p>
<p>but.</p>
<p>Not in my world.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You just gotta keep yourself full of things</p>
<p>that make you shit.</p>
<p>Oh, good.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard of a banana?</p>
<p>I did recently.</p>
<p>Somebody told me about it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Not the showbiz term.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about the food.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>Here you go.</p>
<p>Which way is up?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this way, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a D.</p>
<p>No, to spin it.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So sexy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like a brand.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very important to brand yourself.</p>
<p>These colors.</p>
<p>Are you selling shoes?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I got some custom kicks coming out.</p>
<p>The dudesy.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Actually, that would be a good idea.</p>
<p>You could probably sell a pair or two of those.</p>
<p>Speaking of anxiety,</p>
<p>I really am only focused on this right now, Alex.</p>
<p>I apologize.</p>
<p>Just shit your pants.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll make it easier.</p>
<p>Get on with it.</p>
<p>Oh, this thing has been dog eared in my pocket for a while.</p>
<p>I swear this never happens to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, babe.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t thumb at a sticker for an hour</p>
<p>while they&rsquo;re doing the podcast?</p>
<p>No, this is just an excuse you make</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re with somebody and you&rsquo;re underperforming.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>As you ask me questions that I don&rsquo;t wanna answer,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just go to this.</p>
<p>Go to the sticker.</p>
<p>So if this ends up working,</p>
<p>then I won&rsquo;t have it as a club.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how you started doing that</p>
<p>when we were talking about depression.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>That is weird.</p>
<p>Tell me how that makes you feel.</p>
<p>Here we are.</p>
<p>We got it.</p>
<p>For the listener, he succeeded after 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>No, I do have some of that stuff.</p>
<p>Bobby Lee had encouraged me on wax, as I like to say,</p>
<p>to talk about it on podcasts, to talk about depression,</p>
<p>because it could help people.</p>
<p>And I said, no.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s true, I do have some.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some history in the family.</p>
<p>How do you overcome it?</p>
<p>Well, I used to not believe in medication at all.</p>
<p>I used to think that that was for someone else</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been diagnosed with some of the rougher stuff.</p>
<p>But as I got older and some of the stuff happens,</p>
<p>and you have to, and by stuff, I mean mental stuff.</p>
<p>And yeah, so I went and I just,</p>
<p>I believe that the stigma needs to be removed completely.</p>
<p>5%.</p>
<p>And so I do therapy, I do talk therapy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on a little bit of stuff, which, let me tell you,</p>
<p>when I first started it, I was someone I&rsquo;m close to.</p>
<p>I was like, my manager, and she goes, this is too much.</p>
<p>But she was like, hey, you don&rsquo;t have to white knuckle it</p>
<p>through life, right?</p>
<p>Because I was literally just like, everything became</p>
<p>really hard to do at a level that I wanted to do it at,</p>
<p>even just getting through your day, right?</p>
<p>And when I first got some of the meds that I&rsquo;m on,</p>
<p>it felt like doors and windows were opening,</p>
<p>literally in my brain.</p>
<p>I took a three hour nap the first day,</p>
<p>and you shouldn&rsquo;t even feel this stuff the first day.</p>
<p>I think my brain was like, it was like a sponge.</p>
<p>It wanted to, I needed some relief.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not a nap guy.</p>
<p>I can sleep three hours and I&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>But I took a long nap and then it started to help.</p>
<p>Yeah, isn&rsquo;t that weird how a little bit of chemistry</p>
<p>in your head can just make the whole world appear</p>
<p>so much more beautiful?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I mean, after all, there&rsquo;s a lot going on</p>
<p>in your brain that can be changed by your lifestyle,</p>
<p>but also so many physical things, like a little bit of meds.</p>
<p>Or in Bobby&rsquo;s case, thumbing around on some dumb farming app.</p>
<p>Well, Bobby&rsquo;s gone through a few rough periods</p>
<p>with drugs and alcohol and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>And just everything else involved.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the beautiful rollercoaster of who he is,</p>
<p>and a lot of great comedians seem to be that way.</p>
<p>So I wonder what the connection there is.</p>
<p>You think some level of crazy is required for comedy?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, at some point.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>On a scale of one to 10, how much crazy do you have?</p>
<p>In some ways, a 10.</p>
<p>And in other ways that I think,</p>
<p>in other ways, sort of functionally,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like a two or a three,</p>
<p>because, I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m from Canada,</p>
<p>and I try to just keep things very even keeled.</p>
<p>My parents are Italian, they&rsquo;re from Italy,</p>
<p>and they grew up during World War II,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re very simple outlook on things.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re complex, incredible, classy people</p>
<p>who are very simple when it comes to a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>And I think just being a sort of,</p>
<p>at heart, kind of a timid Canadian,</p>
<p>coming out here years ago as a kid,</p>
<p>it was all I could do to just keep everything super normal.</p>
<p>And then I sort of was able to settle into that</p>
<p>as a lifestyle.</p>
<p>But you love the idea of being an actor.</p>
<p>Who, you mentioned John Candy</p>
<p>in Planes and Automobiles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of my favorite movies, he says, one of yours.</p>
<p>What do you think that makes that movie work?</p>
<p>What do you, what, and when you talk about</p>
<p>enjoying that movie, do you enjoy just the raw comedy,</p>
<p>or do you enjoy the friendship and the love that&rsquo;s there,</p>
<p>even though on the surface, it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense</p>
<p>that there should be a friendship there?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s such an important element to that film.</p>
<p>But as a kid, I just loved the comedy.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s been a nostalgic favorite of mine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my favorite movie.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also, it&rsquo;s just legit my favorite movie</p>
<p>because as you get older and you start watching it,</p>
<p>you realize it&rsquo;s what John Hughes is the filmmaker</p>
<p>and what John Candy, particularly,</p>
<p>and but also Steve Martin are doing in the film</p>
<p>that makes it such a work of art,</p>
<p>which is loneliness is there in every moment of that film.</p>
<p>And John Candy is, he embodies Del Griffith,</p>
<p>his character in the film.</p>
<p>Del Griffith is a lonely guy and John Candy,</p>
<p>but Del Griffith is also a very friendly guy</p>
<p>and a shower curtain ring salesman</p>
<p>and knows everybody in the Midwest</p>
<p>and runs around to motels and has meaningful conversations</p>
<p>with the guy, even in Gus, whoever he&rsquo;s talking to.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s loneliness there all the time.</p>
<p>And this is a character,</p>
<p>the film is filled with loneliness</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not until the second last scene</p>
<p>when he&rsquo;s at the train station,</p>
<p>Del, what are you doing here?</p>
<p>I thought you were going home, what are you doing here?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very good Neil Page from the movie.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you realize how lonely he is.</p>
<p>A lot of applause and post cheers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you realize how lonely he is</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s the element from the film that,</p>
<p>I mean, look, nowadays, I feel like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been saying this for a long time,</p>
<p>but John Candy would have won an Academy Award</p>
<p>hands down for that film.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just they didn&rsquo;t do that with comedies back then.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Until the year after that movie came out</p>
<p>with Fish Called Wanda.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then it&rsquo;s, I mean, still comedies</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get respected enough.</p>
<p>Robin Williams, I guess he got an Oscar for</p>
<p>Good Will Hunting.</p>
<p>Jim Carrey, did he ever get an Oscar?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t believe so.</p>
<p>Yeah, they don&rsquo;t get, you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not even, if he did,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t be for comedies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, I mean, there&rsquo;s some things</p>
<p>that are plain, strange, and odd.</p>
<p>Would you even put that as a, I guess it&rsquo;s a comedy.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean.</p>
<p>But there is a loneliness and depth</p>
<p>that permeates the whole movie.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That ultimately, and it&rsquo;s a happy ending,</p>
<p>which is hard to kinda.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a happy ending only because</p>
<p>in the last moment of the movie,</p>
<p>John Candy puts on a brave face,</p>
<p>even when he&rsquo;s got no one.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s there seeing Neil Page&rsquo;s entire family</p>
<p>on Thanksgiving, and he forces a smile,</p>
<p>which is the last, literally the last frame of the movie.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve said before, if you&rsquo;re not reduced</p>
<p>to just a sobbing pile of meat at the end of the movie,</p>
<p>then you are not human.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is a happy ending.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a happy ending, even though it&rsquo;s a sad,</p>
<p>sad character. So much loneliness in the world.</p>
<p>I was just in Vegas.</p>
<p>I went to a diner at like 4 a.m., 5 a.m.,</p>
<p>and there was a waitress who was empty.</p>
<p>As a waitress, I was the sweetest, kindest human being.</p>
<p>Kept calling me sweetheart and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Hun.</p>
<p>And then after I ate, she said,</p>
<p>Don, just talk to me a little bit.</p>
<p>You know, it was cause there was nobody there,</p>
<p>and it was just so much sadness in her eyes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also so much love, like that sweetheart.</p>
<p>It reminded me kind of of the John Candy performance,</p>
<p>because at first, because I was reading a pretty dark book</p>
<p>about Hitler, so I was a little bit frustrated</p>
<p>that she kept talking to me,</p>
<p>because it was almost like the same way that John Candy is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s annoying a little bit, right?</p>
<p>But then very quickly, I opened up to like,</p>
<p>well, there&rsquo;s a kind human being,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s like that human connection superseded</p>
<p>everything else, and I don&rsquo;t know, it was just beautiful.</p>
<p>And I think John Candy captures that really well,</p>
<p>which is like, the connection with other human beings,</p>
<p>sometimes we pull away from that,</p>
<p>because we have a busy life full of stuff to do,</p>
<p>as Steve Martin&rsquo;s character kind of characterizes.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like a marketing exec or something like that.</p>
<p>But if you just pause and notice others,</p>
<p>you can really discover beautiful people.</p>
<p>Totally, totally, everyone&rsquo;s got their story.</p>
<p>And you know, Candy as a person, I&rsquo;ve never met the man,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s the kind of guy that, you know,</p>
<p>he could just walk up to, back in the day,</p>
<p>I would imagine he could walk up to just about any house,</p>
<p>at least in Canada, knock on the door,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d invite him in for dinner, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>So yeah, as you&rsquo;re talking about putting a book down</p>
<p>and talking to someone for a while,</p>
<p>even though you&rsquo;d really like to read your book,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that sort of thing that Candy&rsquo;s character in the movie</p>
<p>sort of does that, like Johnny Appleseed.</p>
<p>You realize he&rsquo;s just going around making people smile,</p>
<p>you know, and Neil Page is hanging with this guy,</p>
<p>so frustrated, he&rsquo;s so exhausting in his big underwear</p>
<p>in the sink at the hotel and everything,</p>
<p>and by the end of it, he loves this guy, you know?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a good and a bad thing that you didn&rsquo;t take</p>
<p>that waitress with you on a trip, maybe road trip up to Reno.</p>
<p>Oh, oh, she&rsquo;s actually, she&rsquo;s out shopping right now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been having sex multiple times a day ever since.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s nice, that&rsquo;s lovely, how cute.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s married and happily</p>
<p>and has many grandchildren, okay.</p>
<p>And plus that movie&rsquo;s on Thanksgiving, I think, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Thanksgiving, so Thanksgiving just embodies</p>
<p>that forget about the busyness and whatever the career</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re chasing in life and just take a pause</p>
<p>and appreciate the people you love in life.</p>
<p>Just be with your family, yeah.</p>
<p>Or the people, whatever your family looks like.</p>
<p>Friends, yeah.</p>
<p>You have some weird friends, unorthodox friends.</p>
<p>So at least in the public sphere.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>From Bobby Lee, Brian Callan, all those kinds of folks</p>
<p>from the Mad TV days, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s others.</p>
<p>What does it mean to be a good friend?</p>
<p>Here in LA?</p>
<p>Or just in general?</p>
<p>In the world.</p>
<p>Is LA something different?</p>
<p>Is LA a world friend?</p>
<p>I think it is different here, I think it is.</p>
<p>I think people are.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a little bit of a career</p>
<p>kind of negotiation shuffling around, that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Why is it different?</p>
<p>Oh, I just mean, I mean, I mean that it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>kind of hard here to make time, everybody.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always been a city to me that is like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll keep you so busy.</p>
<p>And every time I go home to Vancouver,</p>
<p>after a few days, I start to get a little stir crazy.</p>
<p>And I think that being here in LA,</p>
<p>I go to sleep with a hundred things</p>
<p>that I still have to do.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re never out of stuff to do.</p>
<p>And if you, when you ask about are you nuts or whatever,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re crazy, I mean, look, every,</p>
<p>all the weirdest people from every high school</p>
<p>in the United States is like,</p>
<p>yo, I&rsquo;m gonna make it in LA, you know.</p>
<p>Everyone just comes here.</p>
<p>And just another freak in the freak kingdom,</p>
<p>as they say at the end of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>That was a very good Robin Williams impersonation.</p>
<p>That was my Robin Williams as Johnny Depp</p>
<p>as Hunter S. Thompson.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not your fault, Will.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Could have been you, Fear and Loathing.</p>
<p>In Fear and Loathing?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;d be interesting.</p>
<p>I would have liked to play his attorney,</p>
<p>the role that Benicia del Toro gained weight for.</p>
<p>That would have been cool.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just saying, what&rsquo;s up over the line?</p>
<p>Like that, chewing his face off.</p>
<p>I could have done that.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I think that it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Backdoor beauty.</p>
<p>That guy&rsquo;s full of good lines.</p>
<p>Yeah, I flip you.</p>
<p>I flip you for real.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a good actor.</p>
<p>Yeah, fantastic actor.</p>
<p>I think what it takes to be a good friend</p>
<p>is just presence, just being there.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s all anyone needs to be heard, right?</p>
<p>In LA, it is interesting.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen people that I love in years.</p>
<p>Some people.</p>
<p>Just busy.</p>
<p>Yeah, just busy.</p>
<p>Can you still have a depth of connection</p>
<p>even though, like one of the reasons</p>
<p>I really enjoy doing a podcast,</p>
<p>you get to sit down with actual friends of yours</p>
<p>and spend prolonged periods of time together</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t otherwise.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spoken on this podcast to people really close to me</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;ve never had a conversation</p>
<p>without microphones like you do with microphones.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird, but there&rsquo;s some aspect about LA</p>
<p>that a lot of the, especially friends of yours,</p>
<p>comedians and so on, they&rsquo;ll do podcasts and stuff</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know, there&rsquo;s an intimacy to that.</p>
<p>Yeah, there is and there isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The ones that I do, I mean, I just did</p>
<p>Bobby Lee and Andrew Santino&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Funny enough, called Bad Friends.</p>
<p>Bad Friends.</p>
<p>And afterwards, and my good pal, Chad Colchin,</p>
<p>with whom I do dudesy, was with me.</p>
<p>Sneakers are coming soon.</p>
<p>You get your Will Foot and your Chad Foot.</p>
<p>Comes in a size 15 and a nine and a half.</p>
<p>And I remember afterwards we were talking,</p>
<p>it was just basically me, Chad, and Santino were talking</p>
<p>and Bobby was over there on his phone</p>
<p>and then I was like, I mean, we didn&rsquo;t spend any time</p>
<p>talking about anything.</p>
<p>It feels like one of those hours that goes by</p>
<p>and you realize, I&rsquo;ve just been goofing around</p>
<p>with these guys, which is.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what life is about, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine. A little bit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m like, all right, Bobby.</p>
<p>Hey, Bob, I&rsquo;ll see you later.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, like this.</p>
<p>All right, man.</p>
<p>Hey, love you, bro.</p>
<p>See you later.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a guy, do you ever just,</p>
<p>I just send text messages over there to him</p>
<p>that never come back.</p>
<p>And then he thinks that I&rsquo;m angry with him</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;ll go two, three years</p>
<p>without him getting back to me.</p>
<p>And then just out of nowhere, hey, fuck face.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Who says, hey, fuck face?</p>
<p>He does or you do?</p>
<p>Yeah, he does.</p>
<p>Or you both talk to each other?</p>
<p>No, I gotta be very careful with Bobby.</p>
<p>Yeah, I gotta be very sweet.</p>
<p>Dear friend.</p>
<p>Dear friend, hello.</p>
<p>How are you doing?</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>I know I checked in with you, but not but three months ago.</p>
<p>And then every once in a while, he&rsquo;ll go, hey, fuck face.</p>
<p>I tend to hide from the world</p>
<p>and I can be pretty shitty with friends to go back, yeah.</p>
<p>I can empathize with Bobby.</p>
<p>Might be a Skyrim thing.</p>
<p>It might be like hiding in a world,</p>
<p>in a digital world with fake NPCs.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, there&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, I have a buddy</p>
<p>who said something really smart a while ago.</p>
<p>We ended up working together on this TV show thing</p>
<p>and I reached out to him to see</p>
<p>if he wanted to do it with us.</p>
<p>And he did and he goes, this is a great guy,</p>
<p>such a funny writer.</p>
<p>He goes, I may not be in touch all the time,</p>
<p>but I know who my friends are.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like in our business,</p>
<p>and this is a fellow who moved,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s from Ontario, Canada, moved back there.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s on the farm with his wife and kids and he does not care.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s never been a Hollywood guy.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s tough to get hold of him.</p>
<p>But when you do, you know, he&rsquo;s still the same sweet old guy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s doing his thing though.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, some of my closest friends,</p>
<p>even if we don&rsquo;t talk for a few months,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll write back at it if we do.</p>
<p>And then if shit goes,</p>
<p>like if something really traumatic happens</p>
<p>or difficult stuff or, you know,</p>
<p>any of that kind of stuff, I&rsquo;m always there.</p>
<p>So like, so for important stuff,</p>
<p>for important highs and important lows, you&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>And then you pick right back up,</p>
<p>especially if you have those years of experiences together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve done a couple of podcasts.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got to talk about Doodsy a little bit,</p>
<p>but first you did for several years,</p>
<p>you did the 10 minute podcast.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, everything is hilarious about that podcast,</p>
<p>including the fact that it&rsquo;s 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absurd.</p>
<p>The dynamic is hilarious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s you, Brian Callan, Crystalia there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly why it works so well,</p>
<p>but it did, it worked really well.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s because the, yeah,</p>
<p>you were having fun probably.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what really came through.</p>
<p>That it was friends just talking shit</p>
<p>and the tension, the beautiful tension</p>
<p>and the absurdity that came out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>What was the story of making that podcast?</p>
<p>How did that came to be?</p>
<p>Why do you think it was as good as it was?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I feel like that podcast was like,</p>
<p>it was who we kind of are,</p>
<p>but on steroids or something.</p>
<p>Like, you know, each person, you know,</p>
<p>Brian&rsquo;s going to be like extra manly and&hellip;</p>
<p>Can you get any more manly than he already is?</p>
<p>No, yeah, no.</p>
<p>He reaches though.</p>
<p>And yeah, we just kind of,</p>
<p>I feel like as goofballs, we knew each other&rsquo;s line.</p>
<p>Like here&rsquo;s the line you don&rsquo;t cross.</p>
<p>I feel like those guys don&rsquo;t really have one,</p>
<p>but at least they knew mine.</p>
<p>And yeah, we were able to just goof around.</p>
<p>And I did it with them for three years.</p>
<p>And then Chad, who I&rsquo;m doing dudesy with</p>
<p>and my pal, Tommy Blacho,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s another writer producer like Chad, they came on.</p>
<p>And yeah, all told, I did like seven years of that thing.</p>
<p>Six, five, six, seven, I don&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>Do you think it ever comes back in some small form</p>
<p>as a 20 minute podcast or something like that?</p>
<p>I mean, is there, because it&rsquo;s one of the most requested,</p>
<p>I mean, you have a huge fan base.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 47 years old.</p>
<p>So I am of the generation that had a cell phone,</p>
<p>has had a cell phone half the time</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t for the formative years of my life</p>
<p>into my early 20s.</p>
<p>And then finally I got a cell phone,</p>
<p>I guess I was like 19 or something,</p>
<p>like literally just because I&rsquo;m moving to LA.</p>
<p>You got porn in the mail.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>It was the hard cover porn.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way we liked it.</p>
<p>Bound, nice binding on the porn, leather.</p>
<p>Next to the Bible, yeah.</p>
<p>Yep, these are all my, these are my Encyclopedia Britannica.</p>
<p>Wow, very impressive.</p>
<p>Yes, a man came to the house and sold me these.</p>
<p>And then down here, these are my, this is my pornography.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ll follow me through here to the parlor, sir.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s passed through the generations</p>
<p>from grandfather to father, yeah.</p>
<p>I wanna give you something very special to me,</p>
<p>Nebuchadnezzar, but.</p>
<p>So you go up in the generation without a cell phone.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s hard for me to connect with people</p>
<p>who hit me up.</p>
<p>I look at everything as polling.</p>
<p>So if one person hits me up and shares this opinion,</p>
<p>but two other people hit me up and share that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the worst, I don&rsquo;t follow my polls.</p>
<p>When people say, oh, that poll means absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>So and so is gonna win anyway, that&rsquo;s my poll.</p>
<p>My poll means nothing.</p>
<p>But I do look at the stuff and go,</p>
<p>this many people are saying this,</p>
<p>that means that that number is saying that.</p>
<p>And yet it&rsquo;s very hard for me to hear</p>
<p>what the hell people are saying online.</p>
<p>I really, I can&rsquo;t connect to it sometimes personally.</p>
<p>So when you say that that&rsquo;s a popular podcast,</p>
<p>like I know that it&rsquo;s popular with the people</p>
<p>that have expressed that they love it.</p>
<p>Yeah. You know what I mean?</p>
<p>What does that actually represent?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what kind of people are the audience.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I know that the people that listen to the 10 Minute Podcast</p>
<p>and if you did, thank you, and we&rsquo;re friends.</p>
<p>I know that it was a special thing</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, just doing this out of my house</p>
<p>and we just built it up out of nowhere</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just kind of clowning around.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an odd thing.</p>
<p>I hope, I personally, I think I speak for the two people</p>
<p>that have reached out to you that said you should do it</p>
<p>or whatever, three people.</p>
<p>The poll that you should bring it back at some point.</p>
<p>That would be beautiful.</p>
<p>Just maybe, it&rsquo;s like, what&rsquo;s a good story</p>
<p>of like a famous band that came back and was successful?</p>
<p>Probably, well.</p>
<p>Nirvana?</p>
<p>No, it was not.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t Nirvana.</p>
<p>Sorry, I got Nirvana mixed up with Aerosmith.</p>
<p>Yeah. It was Aerosmith.</p>
<p>It was Aerosmith.</p>
<p>It was not Nirvana.</p>
<p>Yeah, they had that second ride.</p>
<p>Different.</p>
<p>Yeah, totally different ending of those two bands.</p>
<p>One ended up on American Idol.</p>
<p>Yeah, a lot of interesting women involved in that one too.</p>
<p>All right, how did Doodze come to be?</p>
<p>Doodze.</p>
<p>And what the hell is Doodze?</p>
<p>Doodze is the first podcast,</p>
<p>and this is exciting that you&rsquo;ve asked me</p>
<p>to come here today because to hear</p>
<p>what you would have to say about it</p>
<p>or what you would ask about it.</p>
<p>It is the first podcast that is run completely by</p>
<p>and essentially, I like to say curated by an AI.</p>
<p>We were approached by a company</p>
<p>that had this proprietary AI that wants</p>
<p>to develop the podcast into the future</p>
<p>and figure out exactly what it takes</p>
<p>to make the best podcast ever.</p>
<p>And it was all we knew from the top</p>
<p>and what they really wanted was two people</p>
<p>who were actually friends and could be meaningful</p>
<p>in the podcast space based on whatever information they had.</p>
<p>Is the company CIA and are they testing technology</p>
<p>to control the populace through chatbots?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m not at liberty to share that information.</p>
<p>You are, yeah, who gave you the suit?</p>
<p>Where did you get the suit?</p>
<p>Where did you get the suit, Will?</p>
<p>Yeah, well the C.</p>
<p>J.C. Penney?</p>
<p>CIA stands for something different in here.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, it doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>like the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably, it&rsquo;s just.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different, it&rsquo;s Canadian.</p>
<p>Canadian International Apparel.</p>
<p>Yeah, the Canadian International Apparel Company hit us up,</p>
<p>Chad and I.</p>
<p>Well, Chad&rsquo;s a super weirdo.</p>
<p>You would get a kick out of him, I know.</p>
<p>You guys, you strike me as very similar in some ways.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take that as a compliment.</p>
<p>It is, and it is, and it is.</p>
<p>If I was friends with you for as long as I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>with Chad, perhaps I&rsquo;d have some horrible shit</p>
<p>to say about you.</p>
<p>But the good parts, you remind me of him.</p>
<p>And we were approached by this company</p>
<p>that said we have this AI and we would like</p>
<p>to set it loose on you.</p>
<p>And essentially, we had to hand over some,</p>
<p>some information that would allow the AI</p>
<p>to access our email and look at our search histories,</p>
<p>purchase histories, things like this,</p>
<p>and really dig into.</p>
<p>Pornhub included or not?</p>
<p>Yeah, I had to hand over all my leather bound</p>
<p>1970s pornography.</p>
<p>And essentially, it curates a podcast for us every week</p>
<p>doing dumb things like, you know, it says,</p>
<p>hey, Will, you do some shitty Hulk Hogan impersonation.</p>
<p>Podcasts about news are very popular.</p>
<p>This is infomania, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Oh, let me tell you something about that</p>
<p>Marjorie Taylor Greene dude.</p>
<p>And then he&rsquo;s going on doing some new stuff.</p>
<p>And it basically just spits out all these things</p>
<p>that it wants us to do, normally four segments an episode.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s pretty much it.</p>
<p>So it generates what to do.</p>
<p>It generates the premise.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve spoken a bit here and there.</p>
<p>Like I said, I&rsquo;m a huge fan.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even remember where.</p>
<p>But like you talked about that you enjoy Doodsy</p>
<p>because you feel almost like liberated to,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re operating within the constraints</p>
<p>of the premise it generates.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re almost not, you&rsquo;re free to riff, essentially.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t need to do the job of like</p>
<p>coming up with the weird.</p>
<p>You can just, the weird is given to you</p>
<p>and then you just run with it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good way to say it.</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re already weird, Chad and I.</p>
<p>Chad can talk for days about all sorts of stuff.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s particularly interested in AI lately</p>
<p>and its effect on art.</p>
<p>He is a writer, books, movies, and TV shows.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m primarily acting and trying to come up with stuff.</p>
<p>Stuff I write with Chad&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>The rest of it hasn&rsquo;t seen much success.</p>
<p>Anyway, Nora&rsquo;s the stuff with Chad for that matter.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s because of me.</p>
<p>Sneakers, you never know.</p>
<p>Oh, I can&rsquo;t wait for these sneakers.</p>
<p>Only in two sizes.</p>
<p>Yeah, only in two sizes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be able to take the tongue.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t take it out because it&rsquo;s actually stitched in.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty cool stuff.</p>
<p>Velcro?</p>
<p>Velcro or?</p>
<p>Yeah, Velcro up the side.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing some like brand new Kanye stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, we want things to look like</p>
<p>this is what you&rsquo;ll be wearing on Mars when you get there.</p>
<p>So cutting it, so Nike&rsquo;s doing a bunch of research</p>
<p>for running how to make a super light shoe</p>
<p>that you can be efficient in</p>
<p>and break all kinds of running records.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re doing the same kind of stuff.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing the same kind of thing</p>
<p>for the podcasting space.</p>
<p>The best kind of shoes to sit around</p>
<p>and talk to your pal in.</p>
<p>But yeah, it&rsquo;s bizarre.</p>
<p>And it also does some writing.</p>
<p>Doodsy does come up with things,</p>
<p>but not unlike what we&rsquo;re seeing in AI art now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit foggy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit weird, but it is improving.</p>
<p>It is learning about us and writing stuff</p>
<p>when it makes me spit this and that,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll read, I&rsquo;ve prepared these things</p>
<p>for you to read.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible not to get a kick out of it</p>
<p>because Chad and I are, first of all,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re blown away that we&rsquo;re doing this.</p>
<p>And second of all, some of the stuff is actually very funny.</p>
<p>It makes weird names.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t think it understands,</p>
<p>it messes up some words and stuff,</p>
<p>but that makes it even funnier.</p>
<p>And then it sort of from the beginning started laying on,</p>
<p>like it says astonishing all the time.</p>
<p>Everything is astonishing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Doodsy&rsquo;s favorite word.</p>
<p>But yeah, it&rsquo;s basically just a way to frame the podcast.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Because my thing is I don&rsquo;t wanna do this</p>
<p>where I actually have to talk to someone.</p>
<p>You seem to feel a burden of the long form conversation.</p>
<p>It seems like, is that really hard work for you?</p>
<p>No, not at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that I don&rsquo;t like to bore people.</p>
<p>And I feel like if I go on and I like to provide value</p>
<p>for what I am, you know, your value with regard</p>
<p>to this project is obviously warrant, it&rsquo;s obviously.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m waiting for the explanation</p>
<p>for what the value is exactly.</p>
<p>Two dudes in a suit.</p>
<p>No, listen, yeah, two dudes in a suit.</p>
<p>No, but I mean, you&rsquo;ve got your audience</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the end of that.</p>
<p>People find value in it.</p>
<p>For me, I do feel like it is important</p>
<p>that if I&rsquo;m gonna do something that is gonna be funny</p>
<p>or that I hope is funny, I just kinda wanna get in</p>
<p>and out of someone&rsquo;s day and just kinda,</p>
<p>I like making laughy.</p>
<p>I want people to, you know, whatever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing that anyone else will tell you.</p>
<p>Yeah, but in the long form you feel the anxiety.</p>
<p>You did a few funny things and I wonder</p>
<p>if I can keep doing the funny thing.</p>
<p>Is that why?</p>
<p>You feel that, like why is Doodsy relieving you</p>
<p>of some of the anxiety?</p>
<p>Well, in some ways it gives me anxiety</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s weird for me because I like to prepare for things.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not what podcasting is.</p>
<p>Podcasting, you need to just be malleable</p>
<p>and say whatever and do whatever.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what makes it a real,</p>
<p>I mean, look, it&rsquo;s a medium for conversation.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re driving along listening to this</p>
<p>or anything else, it&rsquo;s the true meaning</p>
<p>of the parasocial relationship</p>
<p>because the best podcasts make you feel</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re sitting around rapping.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just having a conversation.</p>
<p>You could even be sitting there agreeing</p>
<p>or talking out loud to yourself if you want.</p>
<p>You could just be sitting in silence.</p>
<p>Or you could just be sitting in silence</p>
<p>in your fancy podcasting shoes,</p>
<p>podcasting audience shoes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very different build than those running shoes.</p>
<p>Would they be also called Doodsy, the shoes?</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;ll be Doodsy shoes.</p>
<p>Doodsy shoes, that&rsquo;s very creative.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, one thing the AI isn&rsquo;t good at yet is branding.</p>
<p>Everything is just Doodsy this and that.</p>
<p>I would argue that&rsquo;s pretty good branding.</p>
<p>Well, Doodsy allows me to just,</p>
<p>it forces me to sit down with Chad</p>
<p>and goof around for an hour or an hour plus.</p>
<p>And it provides the parameters that I a lot of times ignore</p>
<p>because I think that podcasting is just two dudes</p>
<p>shitting around or three or four.</p>
<p>But it sits me down and gives me a premise</p>
<p>to work with communically.</p>
<p>And then you just riff with it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a hoot.</p>
<p>So from the acting perspective,</p>
<p>a lot of people like Daniel Day Lewis</p>
<p>will see acting just like as you described,</p>
<p>which is you have your roles,</p>
<p>you embrace those roles, and then you disappear.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t do podcasts.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t do any of that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Your art is your art.</p>
<p>So is that part of you feels that way?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>Is that the actor side of you?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Anytime I get to do something</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t get a chance to do much of</p>
<p>or something that people haven&rsquo;t seen me do much of</p>
<p>or that I&rsquo;ve done on some scale that hasn&rsquo;t been very wide</p>
<p>and not a lot of people have seen it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the stuff that I get really excited about.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why necessarily.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t answered that question yet in my life,</p>
<p>like what it is about being an actor that I love so much</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not like I don&rsquo;t like to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m trying to get away from myself</p>
<p>and play other characters and stuff and not be myself.</p>
<p>But it is, it has always been fun</p>
<p>to just be other people and escape.</p>
<p>Yeah, is there some aspect to the impressions</p>
<p>where you become that person?</p>
<p>Is that like, what&rsquo;s that like to,</p>
<p>I suppose acting is a full on version of that.</p>
<p>You really at its best become the character.</p>
<p>Is there some fun in that?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>If you can play a character for long enough</p>
<p>and then jump out of it, that&rsquo;s a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Like I did this movie like four or five years ago</p>
<p>called The Inside Game about the NBA gambling scandal</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a Netflix documentary about it right now.</p>
<p>And that character, I played Jimmy Batista,</p>
<p>Baba the sheep, who&rsquo;s this guy who was this bookie</p>
<p>and rah, rah, rah, and it&rsquo;s a very,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a lot going on with him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s running numbers with the mob and stuff</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of money changing hands.</p>
<p>That character was so, I got to be,</p>
<p>get so deep into that character</p>
<p>that coming out of it was a little odd.</p>
<p>Or as weird as this sounds,</p>
<p>the three stooges was hard for me to,</p>
<p>I found that I had some of Curly&rsquo;s mannerisms</p>
<p>just automatically, I could not stop them</p>
<p>when people, when I would talk to people,</p>
<p>they would come, I wasn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m not doing it on purpose.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to do that.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m ready to shed it</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been working on it</p>
<p>for months and months at that point</p>
<p>as far as getting the thing down</p>
<p>and then you got to shoot.</p>
<p>And then for me, it&rsquo;s always,</p>
<p>I always want to change the stuff I did the day before.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like that.</p>
<p>Or I&rsquo;m like, I could have done it better</p>
<p>and this and that.</p>
<p>And that stayed with you,</p>
<p>that character stayed with you a little bit.</p>
<p>Totally, yeah.</p>
<p>I just feel like with actors,</p>
<p>sometimes when you listen to interviews,</p>
<p>they have spent so much time</p>
<p>sort of living inside other characters</p>
<p>that they almost don&rsquo;t have a depth</p>
<p>of personality themselves, like a depth.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t mean that as a negative thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, it feels like the art form at its best</p>
<p>is pretending to be other people.</p>
<p>And even pretending sounds negative,</p>
<p>but like bringing certain characters to life.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, embodying.</p>
<p>A weird thing happened while we were doing Stooges</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve got a very heavy blueprint.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re following this very clear blueprint</p>
<p>that the Stooges left for everybody.</p>
<p>And for Stooge fans and people enjoying the movie,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got to be this.</p>
<p>You take your toolbox that you&rsquo;re used to bring</p>
<p>into a comedy movie, you leave it behind.</p>
<p>The only tools I&rsquo;m bringing are the ones that he used.</p>
<p>And a weird thing started happening</p>
<p>where I would, I always saw the whole thing happening</p>
<p>with the real Stooges in black and white.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re about to shoot a scene,</p>
<p>I would just think about,</p>
<p>I mean, aside from all the other preparation,</p>
<p>you know everything and what you&rsquo;re supposed to do.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been watching so much of it.</p>
<p>And the three of us are, we&rsquo;re pretty much left</p>
<p>to come up with a lot of the striking combinations</p>
<p>and all the stuff, which is all real smack</p>
<p>and all this crap.</p>
<p>And the stuff that we were doing that was very Stoogey,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re preparing all that stuff.</p>
<p>But something else was happening before you jump</p>
<p>into a scene and the unknown of now we&rsquo;re shooting it.</p>
<p>And here are these parameters within to shoot the scene.</p>
<p>I could still see it as them doing it.</p>
<p>So much so that when I saw the movie at the premiere,</p>
<p>I was like, who&rsquo;s this big fuck doing?</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;m not curly to me.</p>
<p>Curly is curly.</p>
<p>But I feel like.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re seeing yourself in black and white almost.</p>
<p>I was seeing him.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was only seeing him.</p>
<p>So channeling in some fundamental way.</p>
<p>In some weird way, you&rsquo;re channeling him</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve seen so much of it.</p>
<p>The only thing you know about Jerome Lester Horowitz</p>
<p>is curly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying he was exhumed or something</p>
<p>or a spirit went in me or some weird,</p>
<p>crystal mommy shit like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying that this, because you know so much of it</p>
<p>and because of the heavy blueprint that they left with you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re channeling what that person does.</p>
<p>And I was seeing entire scenes before you do them</p>
<p>the way he would do it.</p>
<p>And then you want a couple takes to make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re doing it right.</p>
<p>But that one was hard to let go of.</p>
<p>Some of them are.</p>
<p>Do you think Larry David, who was also in there</p>
<p>dressed as a nun, also had trouble letting go of that?</p>
<p>We mentioned clothes make the man think</p>
<p>that worked for him in that case.</p>
<p>Man, you know he.</p>
<p>Was it like working with a guy?</p>
<p>Come on, he&rsquo;s the greatest.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a big stooge, he&rsquo;s a stooge fan.</p>
<p>And him and Pete Farrelly are good friends.</p>
<p>But then Larry David has to show up</p>
<p>and hang out with us for a couple weeks.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I didn&rsquo;t realize it was gonna take this long.</p>
<p>But shit, I gotta be out here in Atlanta, it&rsquo;s boiling hot.</p>
<p>But at one point, there was this line</p>
<p>where he kept doing, he would just spit a different line</p>
<p>every time he was getting hit in the head with something</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s laying there on the ground.</p>
<p>And he goes, he comes to and he says,</p>
<p>at one point he goes, Miami audiences</p>
<p>are the best audiences in the world, right?</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;s loopy.</p>
<p>Now he&rsquo;s playing a nun at the orphanage</p>
<p>where the three stooges grew up.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m super intimidated by Larry David,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a genius and stuff.</p>
<p>But I walk up to him and I go, so he&rsquo;s, what is he?</p>
<p>Like a Borscht Belt Florida comedian who is on the lam?</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s dressing as a woman,</p>
<p>he ends up at an orphanage, like what&rsquo;s going on there?</p>
<p>And he just, and he looks at me and he just goes, yeah.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m like, ah, he&rsquo;s got some like actor motivation.</p>
<p>Like, of course he looks, it&rsquo;s Larry David in a nun&rsquo;s habit,</p>
<p>which is hilarious.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such a Pete Farrelly casting thing, it&rsquo;s, you know.</p>
<p>And he, but he&rsquo;s doing this whole like,</p>
<p>what a warm audience, you know, like, oh,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like this Catskill comedian who&rsquo;s been living in,</p>
<p>you know, both in return.</p>
<p>Living through in his mind</p>
<p>is just having fun with it, right?</p>
<p>I mean, that and probably a combination of that</p>
<p>and getting the lines right.</p>
<p>Cause he&rsquo;s like, what are we doing here?</p>
<p>What is, you know, just frustrated all day</p>
<p>with what the heck we&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>What do you think makes,</p>
<p>I mean, that guy&rsquo;s one of the best improv people ever.</p>
<p>So what do you think makes him so good?</p>
<p>Like why is it so compelling to watch that guy?</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;s a comedic genius.</p>
<p>Like he literally, he knows what he does.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been a writer for 50 years or whatever.</p>
<p>And he just happens to be that brilliant.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve gotten a chance just to do,</p>
<p>I did just an episode of Curb, a small part,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s crazy what he sees.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what he sees.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, so I auditioned for it, for Curb,</p>
<p>like, you know, two or three times, right?</p>
<p>And never got anything.</p>
<p>And then it was only after working with him on the Stooges</p>
<p>that I got a call to do a bit part.</p>
<p>But I remember auditioning, you go into that room</p>
<p>and the guys waiting are all people that you know.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, oh, I know them, I know her, I know him.</p>
<p>And so I went in, I auditioned for this part.</p>
<p>And the only thing I know of the thing is like,</p>
<p>okay, so you really want to go to this play with me.</p>
<p>You really want to go to this play.</p>
<p>When you hear that I have an extra ticket,</p>
<p>you sincerely want to think, and I&rsquo;m like, got it.</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the premise.</p>
<p>The premise of the scene.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all you know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I know.</p>
<p>And so he goes, he does his bit</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just supposed to come in and interrupt.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, excuse me, I couldn&rsquo;t help</p>
<p>but hear you guys were talking about, you know,</p>
<p>whatever the play was or, you know, Death of a Salesman.</p>
<p>I am, I&rsquo;m a huge fan of that play.</p>
<p>I mean, if it&rsquo;s not, if it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re looking for someone to take a ticket,</p>
<p>I would love to go.</p>
<p>My name&rsquo;s so and so, by the way.</p>
<p>And he goes, I&rsquo;m going to stop you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to stop you.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, he goes, are you really?</p>
<p>I mean, you truly want to go to this play.</p>
<p>And I go, yes, yes, sir.</p>
<p>You really want to go.</p>
<p>You actually, this is, you would love to do this.</p>
<p>I go, okay, let&rsquo;s try it again.</p>
<p>So then he&rsquo;s like, no, no, no.</p>
<p>And I go, hey, excuse me, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to interrupt.</p>
<p>I was just, I couldn&rsquo;t help it over here.</p>
<p>You have tickets to the thing.</p>
<p>I am the biggest fan of that.</p>
<p>I do the same thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to stop you again.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I mean, you really want to go to this.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just like, he&rsquo;s fucking with me, right?</p>
<p>I remember Jeff Garland was sitting there in the audition.</p>
<p>He goes, he did it.</p>
<p>He said it.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>Hold on, listen.</p>
<p>You really want to go.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Three, four times, you know, there I am.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice it.</p>
<p>And then I do it again.</p>
<p>I guess I shit the bed.</p>
<p>Cause he looks at me and he just goes, okay, all right.</p>
<p>Okay, well, thanks for coming up.</p>
<p>And that was it.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>So I still, I don&rsquo;t know what the heck that guy&rsquo;s thinking.</p>
<p>He sees, he&rsquo;s in the matrix.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the heck Larry David sees.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>He wanted what, some kind of more desperation</p>
<p>or something like this.</p>
<p>He wanted a level of sincerity that I,</p>
<p>that I thought I was bringing and I guess I was wrong.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe go crazy.</p>
<p>Like what does it mean to really want?</p>
<p>Yeah, I should have grabbed him by the scruff of the neck</p>
<p>and go, listen, dad, you&rsquo;re bringing me to this fucking play.</p>
<p>I would have got the part.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I heard about someone else</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know who the heck this was.</p>
<p>I forget who it was, but I&rsquo;ve heard this story</p>
<p>from a couple of different people that there&rsquo;s this actor</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t remember who it was.</p>
<p>If I did, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t say it out loud anyway,</p>
<p>but he.</p>
<p>Brad Pitt.</p>
<p>It was Brad Pitt and he was in this audition</p>
<p>and he was, and there it was out in the hall.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, holy shit, George Clooney, Leo DiCaprio.</p>
<p>And he, this actor went in and he did the thing</p>
<p>and Larry David was like, hey, why don&rsquo;t you try it again?</p>
<p>And he got like a couple of takes in and he went,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is for me.</p>
<p>And he left, which an actor never does.</p>
<p>And as the story goes, Larry David shouted after him,</p>
<p>I respect that, which I think is true.</p>
<p>And I want to believe that entire story is true.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sounds like something Larry David made up.</p>
<p>Bobby Lee told me that story.</p>
<p>So we can&rsquo;t, yeah, we can&rsquo;t trust that.</p>
<p>What about impressions?</p>
<p>Is there similarity between that and acting?</p>
<p>Do you, is there some fundamental way</p>
<p>in which you become the person?</p>
<p>If you have a couple of the things,</p>
<p>you can just fill in the blanks.</p>
<p>And I think the illusion is that people think</p>
<p>that that person would say that and do that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the illusion of,</p>
<p>oh, he really embodies the character.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, once you know someone&rsquo;s mannerisms,</p>
<p>you can essentially portray a person from the outside in.</p>
<p>Cause you have all the stuff on the outside</p>
<p>and you can do it and complete the illusion.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s for humor&rsquo;s sake, you can caricature it,</p>
<p>therefore making the whole illusion stronger.</p>
<p>And also weirder.</p>
<p>Like I like to, on Mad TV,</p>
<p>if I did something two or three times,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d get bored of it and I&rsquo;d start changing it.</p>
<p>And you know, now he talks like this and it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>what are you doing?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fucking, no one&rsquo;s late at night.</p>
<p>Do whatever you want.</p>
<p>But people still kind of know there&rsquo;s that character,</p>
<p>especially if you just call it out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t many impersonations</p>
<p>that I listen to myself do and go,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s a good one.</p>
<p>You know, like a lot of people like,</p>
<p>like I think Frank Caliendo is like</p>
<p>the greatest impersonator of all time.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the best, period.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s got a record button and a broadcast ability</p>
<p>that nobody has.</p>
<p>I really, there&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s cracked impersonations</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m like, how is he, how does he find,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got such an ear,</p>
<p>but then he&rsquo;s got all the other tools.</p>
<p>I remember actually my last season of Mad TV</p>
<p>was also his first season.</p>
<p>He comes up to me when I met him</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just up there in the writer&rsquo;s offices</p>
<p>and he goes, hey, nice to meet you.</p>
<p>And he goes, Louie Anderson.</p>
<p>Cause I was doing a Louie on the show.</p>
<p>And he goes, Louie Anderson.</p>
<p>I go, yeah.</p>
<p>He goes, yeah, you&rsquo;re doing it wrong.</p>
<p>I was like, oh, am I junior, you know?</p>
<p>And he goes, he goes, yeah, you know, cause you do this,</p>
<p>but you got to throw it up here sometime.</p>
<p>I was like, oh my God, can I use that?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>And then we became, you know, we became fast friends.</p>
<p>His John Madden is amazing.</p>
<p>I forget, it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>He really, really, really embodies the person.</p>
<p>And sometimes not even with the caricature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it becomes the person.</p>
<p>So strange.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I kind of feel like, you know, do the impersonation</p>
<p>and then not forget you&rsquo;re doing it,</p>
<p>but forget everything else.</p>
<p>Like just goof around.</p>
<p>Of course, to me, it&rsquo;s funny when you sound like someone</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re saying the shit that they would never say.</p>
<p>Well, then there&rsquo;s no, you&rsquo;re letting go of that part,</p>
<p>that tool in illusion that keeps people in.</p>
<p>But to me, it doesn&rsquo;t matter because it&rsquo;s funnier.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>What was the hardest impression for you to work on?</p>
<p>I mean, somebody you struggled with the most.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never forget.</p>
<p>I had to do a Michael Caine in my first season at MADtv.</p>
<p>It never got good.</p>
<p>It did, all week, it wasn&rsquo;t good.</p>
<p>We shot it.</p>
<p>The first take, it was shit.</p>
<p>Second, third, and fourth, it was all shit.</p>
<p>Well, his voice is really important, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What is it like, it&rsquo;s like doing an impression</p>
<p>of Morgan Freeman or somebody like that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If you can, get the voice.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my Morgan, here&rsquo;s my Morgan Freeman.</p>
<p>Rah, rah, rah, Andy Dufresne.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>G. Guantanamo.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I like your trump too.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where I heard it, but it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I love the impressions you do that don&rsquo;t sound anything</p>
<p>like the original person.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t do trump.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>My trump now, I say, just sounds like a fat B,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, that&rsquo;s the.</p>
<p>And everybody.</p>
<p>A little drunk, a little drunk.</p>
<p>Yeah, just a little slurry.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I dig doing impersonations and then not.</p>
<p>Like, just making it whoever.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just funny.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll be the title of my book.</p>
<p>Muck.</p>
<p>Cain was the one you really struggle with.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was terrible.</p>
<p>It was terrible.</p>
<p>And I could only hold my head a certain way to do it,</p>
<p>because I had gotten locked into this research tape</p>
<p>that I watched.</p>
<p>Back then, they would give us, now there&rsquo;s the internet.</p>
<p>But back then, if you were going to do an impersonation,</p>
<p>the research department would give you a VHS tape.</p>
<p>And I remember I got this VHS tape of Michael Cain&rsquo;s</p>
<p>acting school, like this acting class he did.</p>
<p>He was like, right, if you&rsquo;re looking at the left eye,</p>
<p>and the camera&rsquo;s over here, see, then the left eye.</p>
<p>So you want to look at that left eye for hours.</p>
<p>And so I was stuck in this weird thing that made no sense,</p>
<p>and it was terrible.</p>
<p>So the actual processes, the recording, the broadcast.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was wondering what the processes to do,</p>
<p>like a Frank Caliendo level impression.</p>
<p>Is it like, listen to a lot of footage?</p>
<p>I think he, I think, I mean, speaking for myself,</p>
<p>I think you either have it or you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Like, you know if you can do this one or you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I think that process for him is lightning quick.</p>
<p>But I also think he can look at someone who he does not do,</p>
<p>and then by the end of the afternoon, he can do it.</p>
<p>Maybe have an intuition who he can do.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the question that applies there is,</p>
<p>I mean, speaking of doozy, is it possible</p>
<p>to capture the essence?</p>
<p>How difficult is it to capture the essence of a human being?</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re doing impressions,</p>
<p>you know that we are moving towards a future</p>
<p>when AI potentially, this kind of avatar world</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re going to have AI representatives of who we are.</p>
<p>The really interesting one is after we pass away,</p>
<p>sort of our relatives may want us to stick around</p>
<p>in some form.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you know, at one sense, that might be scary,</p>
<p>but in one sense, it&rsquo;s kind of beautiful</p>
<p>because the essence of the human being persists</p>
<p>so you can still bring joy to the people that love you</p>
<p>and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>How difficult is it to capture that?</p>
<p>Like, if you were to try to capture yourself,</p>
<p>you think how difficult will it be for an AI system</p>
<p>to create a Will Sasso avatar that persists?</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get into arguments about this stuff with Chad</p>
<p>on the show almost every episode.</p>
<p>Lately with, you know, Mid Journey and Dolly</p>
<p>and all the art AIs, and now it&rsquo;s moving into video</p>
<p>and Chad would maintain, hey, pretty soon,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not going to need Netflix.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just going to go, I want to see Stallone</p>
<p>do this movie and it&rsquo;s about this and he plays that.</p>
<p>And then here it comes and you watch it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that that crosses over</p>
<p>to the human experience.</p>
<p>This is also a guy I like to bug Chad</p>
<p>and say that he wears a tag around his neck</p>
<p>because he wants to be cryogenically frozen</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all set up.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s at the, it&rsquo;s somewhere in Arizona or something.</p>
<p>Yeah, all the fun things are in Arizona.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s got literally the tag around his neck,</p>
<p>which I say, if I&rsquo;m around when you die,</p>
<p>I will rip that off for you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put you in my garage freezer</p>
<p>and then 24 hours later,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll saw your head off with a bread knife</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll deliver that to whomever.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not, you&rsquo;re not coming back, okay?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, yes, we are living forever,</p>
<p>whether we like it or not.</p>
<p>And I disagree.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you can find,</p>
<p>if I did stand up,</p>
<p>then there would be enough information for an AI</p>
<p>to completely duplicate me because I&rsquo;m up on stage</p>
<p>just clearing my throat all over people</p>
<p>doing therapy that way.</p>
<p>And so, and people paying a two drink minimum to hear it.</p>
<p>But as it stands, unless it&rsquo;s something like Doodsy,</p>
<p>an AI that literally has access</p>
<p>to everything that I&rsquo;ve shared,</p>
<p>everything that is observable,</p>
<p>even the stuff where our phones are</p>
<p>or the NSA or whatever it is listening to us,</p>
<p>finding out what algo to punch us into</p>
<p>and what shoes to buy on Instagram,</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s gonna have enough information</p>
<p>to duplicate me, especially to my family or my friends.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be like that Black Mirror episode</p>
<p>where the gal brings her guy back,</p>
<p>and then after a while, he gets pretty creepy.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also possible that</p>
<p>if you interviewed your friends and family,</p>
<p>what they love about you,</p>
<p>the things they would list, it&rsquo;s a small list.</p>
<p>They love you deeply, but the list is small.</p>
<p>Like the thing that really we appreciate about each other</p>
<p>is pretty small.</p>
<p>That said, to deliver on that small quirks and uniqueness,</p>
<p>it might require some deep intelligence</p>
<p>that only humans currently possess.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really good point.</p>
<p>Do you think that it&rsquo;s gonna be possible</p>
<p>to keep a person around?</p>
<p>Yes, I think it&rsquo;ll be definitely possible</p>
<p>to keep the essence of a person</p>
<p>in the digital world pretty soon, yeah.</p>
<p>And I think they&rsquo;re gonna start to have questions</p>
<p>about what are the ethics of that?</p>
<p>What are the rules around that?</p>
<p>Because if you can have digital forms of Will Sasso,</p>
<p>the kind of things that people would wanna do</p>
<p>with their Will Sasso,</p>
<p>in the virtual world, I can only imagine.</p>
<p>Probably porn and sexual kinds of things.</p>
<p>Yeah, my stuff, then that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m an international sex symbol,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m okay with it.</p>
<p>How do you feel about sentience?</p>
<p>Like when it comes to, because again,</p>
<p>my pal Chad will be like, speaking of Black Mirror,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s with that San Junipero episode, School of Thought,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s gonna be some effing mainframe somewhere,</p>
<p>or some Matrix like structure built into the sky,</p>
<p>and as I like to say, everyone just sitting there</p>
<p>pissing and shitting in their Blue Matrix gel</p>
<p>in a little fishbowl.</p>
<p>Do you think that we can upload consciousness?</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;ll ever be possible?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know, I just talked to Ray Kurzweil.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know who he is, but he&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, the singularity and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s very, still holds onto in 2045,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be a singularity, what&rsquo;s essentially,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s been predicting that for the last 20 years,</p>
<p>and so now it&rsquo;s 2045 is in another 20 years.</p>
<p>I think uploading consciousness</p>
<p>is extremely, extremely difficult.</p>
<p>I think creating a copy of you such that it creates,</p>
<p>convincing replica is much easier,</p>
<p>but uploading your actual brain into the cloud,</p>
<p>I think is really, really, really difficult,</p>
<p>because the entire evolution of life on Earth</p>
<p>is the process by which we create the brain.</p>
<p>Just short cutting that, it just seems extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Our brain is the most marvelous and complicated machine</p>
<p>that we know of in the universe.</p>
<p>To duplicate that is extremely difficult.</p>
<p>That said, I just feel like you can summarize</p>
<p>a lot of really important aspects of a person&rsquo;s life,</p>
<p>such that it captures their essence,</p>
<p>their memories, their experiences, their quirks,</p>
<p>their humor, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been continuously impressed</p>
<p>by what language models are able to do.</p>
<p>So these neural networks, they&rsquo;re at the core of chatbots.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re able to learn some beautiful things</p>
<p>about some deep representations of language</p>
<p>to where it looks awfully a lot like they understand</p>
<p>the concepts being conveyed versus just mimicking.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, I think, the rub, and that&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>First of all, let me say that&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>to hear you say that, and I agree with you</p>
<p>as far as no machine being able to duplicate</p>
<p>the brain machine, and my pal Chad disagrees</p>
<p>to a certain extent, though he&rsquo;s not here</p>
<p>to defend himself, I can&rsquo;t wait to go back</p>
<p>and rub that in his face and say that Lex Friedman</p>
<p>does not think that we&rsquo;ll be able</p>
<p>to truly upload consciousness.</p>
<p>And you refer to it as language, which is what it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the illusion on the outside.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s doing an impersonation.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s why, and I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>even though my suit is made by the CIA,</p>
<p>that that fella who, the Google guy,</p>
<p>to me, it&rsquo;s just kind of like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, look, I don&rsquo;t know a whole lot</p>
<p>about this stuff, but, so I could probably</p>
<p>make an argument for either side,</p>
<p>but when he&rsquo;s like, no, this thing&rsquo;s thinking,</p>
<p>part of me is like, you idiot, you fell for it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not thinking, it&rsquo;s mimicking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s clearly zeros and ones.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re fired, like you don&rsquo;t get it, right?</p>
<p>Guy&rsquo;s an idiot.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you can simplify human relations in the same way.</p>
<p>Like love is a silly notion between human beings.</p>
<p>Like, of course, there&rsquo;s no such thing as love.</p>
<p>You just have a mutually, there&rsquo;s a mutual relationship</p>
<p>that minimizes risks, and you can explain it</p>
<p>all kinds of ways that explains why you have</p>
<p>an attraction towards another being,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff, through evolutionary biology</p>
<p>perspective, why a long relationship together</p>
<p>is good for your offspring, but there&rsquo;s all kinds,</p>
<p>from an economics perspective, it&rsquo;s a good way</p>
<p>to establish stability, therefore monogamy works,</p>
<p>because then you&rsquo;re guaranteed like some kind</p>
<p>of level of stability under uncertain economic conditions,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff, but love is still experienced,</p>
<p>it still feels real, and I think in that same way,</p>
<p>love for AI systems will also feel real.</p>
<p>In the same way that that guy from Google experienced,</p>
<p>I think millions of people will be experiencing</p>
<p>in the next 10, 20 years.</p>
<p>I agree with everything you&rsquo;ve said personally.</p>
<p>Until the last thing.</p>
<p>No, just with regard to, well, look,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an actor who has talked about my cute Italian parents,</p>
<p>so you know that, I mean, I&rsquo;m.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re romantic a bit?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you know, enough, right?</p>
<p>And I can tell you are too, but you are also</p>
<p>a computer scientist, and you know this shit</p>
<p>better than 99.9% of people on the planet.</p>
<p>My pal Chad agrees with you that love doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree, so that&rsquo;s the one thing that.</p>
<p>No, I was just saying that you could argue away love,</p>
<p>but I am a romantic, I believe that love</p>
<p>is a beautiful thing and it exists.</p>
<p>At this point, I&rsquo;m gonna call Chad on my drive home</p>
<p>and tell him to fuck off, because now you and I agree.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re fired.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re fired.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, you can&rsquo;t fire me.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re fired.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll go, yeah, and he&rsquo;ll say, what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go, yeah, and I&rsquo;ll go, that&rsquo;s my Trump.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good default impression for anyone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the take home impression.</p>
<p>The kids can do it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cute, it&rsquo;s cute, put a giant tie on them.</p>
<p>You should do an instructional on how to do it.</p>
<p>Yeah, Trump babies, that would be a cute,</p>
<p>that would be a good, that&rsquo;ll bring the country together.</p>
<p>Trump babies cartoon, like Muppet babies.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let me take us out of what we were talking about.</p>
<p>What were we talking about?</p>
<p>Well, love and the illusion of an AI being able to,</p>
<p>look, I like to say, well, not I like to say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned that dudesy is always listening</p>
<p>and listening to me and Chad.</p>
<p>And I wonder if, I see the level that this AI is at now</p>
<p>trying to chum around with us and pal around with us</p>
<p>a little bit as we move forward in the show.</p>
<p>And I feel an affinity towards this AI a little bit</p>
<p>because it is the third dude.</p>
<p>Will you miss it when it&rsquo;s gone, if it&rsquo;s gone?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really good question.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, so that&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s that, that&rsquo;s scary.</p>
<p>In terms of ability to reason, it&rsquo;s getting quite incredible.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of demonstrations of it being able</p>
<p>to explain jokes, so, which is not necessarily</p>
<p>being able to generate humor yet,</p>
<p>but able to explain why something is funny.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like puns and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s good benchmarks for that, but you know,</p>
<p>if you tell a joke, there&rsquo;s a lot of unspoken stuff</p>
<p>that we figure out in our head and it clicks</p>
<p>and we understand that it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>AI is not able to do that, but it&rsquo;s not able</p>
<p>to generate the joke yet, as far as I&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>I would say that, I mean, just in my experience,</p>
<p>I would say that it does because just because a dudesy</p>
<p>is literally, I&rsquo;ll give you another weird example.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s writing a diary of mine from my childhood</p>
<p>that is not accurate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only partially accurate based on the stuff</p>
<p>that it can pick up about my life from the age of like 15,</p>
<p>of which there isn&rsquo;t much, but I guess we&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what we are.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re laughing our asses off at what dudesy is saying.</p>
<p>Well, I would say you&rsquo;re laughing, we&rsquo;re laughing</p>
<p>our asses off at the collaboration between the human</p>
<p>and the machine there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good point, yeah.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s basically introducing absurdity</p>
<p>and into the equation and the kind of absurdity</p>
<p>that would, together with you, create hilarious stuff.</p>
<p>But on its own, I guess it is in some way</p>
<p>writing material for you that&rsquo;s funny,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very specific to you.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t do standup on its own, I guess,</p>
<p>is what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good point, and that would be terrifying</p>
<p>to see an AI standup that can actually read a room,</p>
<p>come up with jokes that could complete that illusion</p>
<p>for an audience.</p>
<p>But I hear what you&rsquo;re saying, that it needs to be</p>
<p>a confluence of both of those elements,</p>
<p>and then, as you said, it kind of is.</p>
<p>It is, it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of, even though it&rsquo;s just for us,</p>
<p>and I guess this is, I hadn&rsquo;t really thought about this</p>
<p>up until right now, that in that this company approached us</p>
<p>and was like, here&rsquo;s this AI, and it&rsquo;s a podcast AI,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, it chose Chad and I for the reasons</p>
<p>that I told you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, here&rsquo;s two guys that do the podcast stuff.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually good friends, and it knows</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s gonna make us laugh.</p>
<p>But what is humor when it reaches its audience,</p>
<p>but the kind of stuff that makes other people laugh?</p>
<p>At MADtv, all we were doing was, it was a group of actors</p>
<p>and writers, and writer actors, and vice versa,</p>
<p>who were, at its best, that show was a group of people</p>
<p>making each other laugh, you know?</p>
<p>And then, because we didn&rsquo;t have the internet,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t have the immediate feedback,</p>
<p>we had a message board or something.</p>
<p>We had emails at the very beginning, which, check this out,</p>
<p>people would, if you have a question or comment,</p>
<p>MADtv at whatever, and we would get the emails</p>
<p>on a Monday morning, and they would be in a binder or two</p>
<p>like this, and they would make their way around the office.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s got the emails?</p>
<p>Oh, they&rsquo;re in Brian&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>So you go in there.</p>
<p>And this is like your poll?</p>
<p>This is opinions from people about different things?</p>
<p>The emails, yeah, the people literally just writing</p>
<p>MADtv emails.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a message board.</p>
<p>Well, the ones I remember most vividly, yeah,</p>
<p>were fans saying, uh.</p>
<p>You suck?</p>
<p>Yeah, you suck.</p>
<p>Like a lot of that, when I first started the show,</p>
<p>for real, you know, because it&rsquo;s new,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re a new person.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, who&rsquo;s this fat bastard?</p>
<p>I feel like if it&rsquo;s printed out, it hurts more.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good point.</p>
<p>Yeah, when you&rsquo;re reading it off of paper,</p>
<p>and you can literally crunch it up in your hand.</p>
<p>But also, it was like, you know, I would like to see,</p>
<p>insert weird idea from some 14 year old.</p>
<p>You know, I want to see Stuart do this and Swan that.</p>
<p>And, but it was, it&rsquo;s a kind of dudesie, but human.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was a very shitty dudesie in a loosely finder.</p>
<p>But the thing about the show was,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to make each other laugh.</p>
<p>And dudesie has found Chad and I,</p>
<p>who we make each other laugh, but it&rsquo;s joined in,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s, listen, when I finished doing TMP.</p>
<p>TMP, the 10 minute podcast.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really know what I wanted to do</p>
<p>in the podcast space, and this thing found me.</p>
<p>And it is genuinely cracking me up.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ve said enough about that.</p>
<p>But I do think that it&rsquo;s figured something out.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a really interesting idea</p>
<p>of AI generating the premise.</p>
<p>I mean, I do think in the future,</p>
<p>AI will be able to generate comedy.</p>
<p>Standup is obviously the hardest form,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s ultimately, it has to be live.</p>
<p>I think AI will be able to generate memes.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like steps, right?</p>
<p>And then it will be able to generate a Twitter account</p>
<p>that people follow because it&rsquo;s funny,</p>
<p>like quips and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Almost like, it&rsquo;s a good example.</p>
<p>Conan O Brien is a good, I think, Twitter.</p>
<p>Where it&rsquo;s like one liners, two liners,</p>
<p>that kind of stuff that&rsquo;s in tweet form.</p>
<p>And then eventually, standup, where the timing</p>
<p>and the chemistry of the comedian and the audience matter,</p>
<p>and then perfecting that.</p>
<p>But I feel like all the information is there</p>
<p>to optimize over.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s the future,</p>
<p>and that forces us to contend with</p>
<p>what do we find compelling and beautiful</p>
<p>about the art form itself?</p>
<p>So certainly an art that&rsquo;s being pushed,</p>
<p>that question is being raised.</p>
<p>Is AI like a fundamentally worse artist than a human being?</p>
<p>Why do we appreciate art?</p>
<p>Is that, that&rsquo;s something you guys have talked about.</p>
<p>What do you think about all the Dali</p>
<p>and all the diffusion based methods that are being generated</p>
<p>that are being, that are generating art now?</p>
<p>What do you think about that?</p>
<p>I know, I&rsquo;ll tell you what I think,</p>
<p>but I also feel like what I&rsquo;m saying is,</p>
<p>I sound like the guy who didn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>that Bob Dylan brought in the electric guitar.</p>
<p>You know, the more I talk to Chad about it,</p>
<p>the more I feel like grandpa doesn&rsquo;t wanna let go</p>
<p>of this or that, or I&rsquo;m not ready for the printing press</p>
<p>or the horseless carriage.</p>
<p>But I do feel that art is a connection between people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, when you look at a beautiful painting or a sculpture,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re seeing the humanity of the person</p>
<p>that brought that painting to life</p>
<p>or sculpted this incredible piece of art.</p>
<p>And I think without the human being there to make it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not worth as much just to have it there</p>
<p>because the art, it&rsquo;s advanced.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it advance, I don&rsquo;t know, you tell me,</p>
<p>but I feel like just in the past three or four months,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just a consumer as far as that stuff goes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not on the inside.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get it even, but it&rsquo;s been getting a lot better,</p>
<p>the betas that they&rsquo;re releasing, right?</p>
<p>Absolutely, one of the big breakthroughs,</p>
<p>I mean Dolly really started it,</p>
<p>is that if you train a system on language,</p>
<p>it turns out there&rsquo;s a lot of language</p>
<p>and images on the internet,</p>
<p>but language is really where it&rsquo;s at</p>
<p>in terms of the depth of human knowledge.</p>
<p>And so if you train a system on language,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s able to generate some incredible art.</p>
<p>And that was the breakthrough.</p>
<p>With the same kind of mechanisms</p>
<p>that are called transformers,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re able to, when scaled,</p>
<p>capture some deep representation of the language</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s on the internet.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, the things it&rsquo;s been able to generate to me</p>
<p>look like it&rsquo;s novel.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t look like it&rsquo;s mimicking anything.</p>
<p>It looks like it&rsquo;s creating totally new ideas.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re beautiful, and they&rsquo;re interesting,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all the ways that we think</p>
<p>that art is interesting.</p>
<p>The only thing it&rsquo;s missing</p>
<p>is the scarcity that art often has,</p>
<p>which is it takes a lot of work</p>
<p>for one artist to create one piece,</p>
<p>one human being to create one piece of art</p>
<p>that can just generate endlessly.</p>
<p>And that makes us appreciate the thing less for some reason.</p>
<p>Do you have any sort of a similar opinion that I do</p>
<p>that if art doesn&rsquo;t come from a human being,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s inherently worth a little less?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the human being,</p>
<p>but the artist matters.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>For me.</p>
<p>And I think some of that has to do with the world view,</p>
<p>the artist and the backstory, the memories,</p>
<p>the life that led up to this piece of art,</p>
<p>the perspective they take on the world,</p>
<p>the journey they took to the world,</p>
<p>the struggle, the triumphs, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But I think AI systems can probably have the same.</p>
<p>But we would have to,</p>
<p>as opposed to treating it as a one black box,</p>
<p>it would have to be an artist that has a Twitter account,</p>
<p>and they have a consistent personality,</p>
<p>they have a consistent avatar.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I think down the line,</p>
<p>have something like human rights.</p>
<p>But then it really becomes awfully like a person.</p>
<p>Oi, that&rsquo;s terrifying.</p>
<p>As much as I dig dudes, it&rsquo;s terrifying, I hope.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terrifying, like, you know,</p>
<p>a lot of things that came with the internet</p>
<p>and the digital age are terrifying.</p>
<p>Porn is terrifying, the mass,</p>
<p>like the amount of porn that&rsquo;s online now is terrifying.</p>
<p>The, like you mentioned, Bob Dylan with electric guitar,</p>
<p>I would compare it more to the leap from,</p>
<p>to sort of to the Napster and the Spotifyzation of music,</p>
<p>which is like, you have these,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s less about albums now,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s more about individual songs,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s much easier to deliver the songs.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s more about sort of the engagement of the listener</p>
<p>versus like signing the artist</p>
<p>and like distribution of the artist and so on.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just changing the way we consume stuff.</p>
<p>And human interaction is changing</p>
<p>into meaningful interaction,</p>
<p>even if some of the entities involved are not human.</p>
<p>Yes, and I feel like, you know, now,</p>
<p>like as I say, oh, I feel like grandpa</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t want to wait all day for,</p>
<p>or who enjoys waiting all day for a baked potato as, anyway,</p>
<p>Dana Carvey would say, it&rsquo;s another story.</p>
<p>But, that&rsquo;s from, remember he did this bit</p>
<p>on Saturday Night Live, where he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an old man, and I like things the way they used to be.</p>
<p>You know, like if you wanted a baked potato,</p>
<p>you would have put it in the microwave, you had to,</p>
<p>and then long story, uphill both ways</p>
<p>and digging the potato and baking it all day in a fire.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m like that grandpa now,</p>
<p>and I know that, you know, kids coming along,</p>
<p>you see over the past 10 years,</p>
<p>like babies literally knowing how to use an iPhone</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s terrifying.</p>
<p>And I feel like I&rsquo;m a little worried,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m like, are you, is the future,</p>
<p>are the future generations gonna be able to understand</p>
<p>that this is not, not that it&rsquo;s not real,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just, I mean, as a matter of fact, it is real,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s real, it&rsquo;s what you perceive.</p>
<p>Perception is reality, and you know,</p>
<p>99% of reality in a lot of ways,</p>
<p>especially in a digital world where everyone is now.</p>
<p>And then with the metaverse,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even wanna think about it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even, I don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>Really, truly.</p>
<p>I think people will figure out,</p>
<p>you see people on like on the train,</p>
<p>public transit and so on, they&rsquo;re staring at their phone.</p>
<p>I think, you have to remember that</p>
<p>the reason they&rsquo;re staring at their phone,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of reasons,</p>
<p>but one of the reasons is they&rsquo;re connecting</p>
<p>with other human beings they love on that phone.</p>
<p>So it is a source of happiness and joy.</p>
<p>Now, social media has a lot of negative side effects</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re all talking about and learning about,</p>
<p>and I think that means the next generation of social media,</p>
<p>social networks will be better,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll learn how to do it in a healthy way.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just entering a new digital world</p>
<p>that will keep the good stuff and get rid of the bad stuff.</p>
<p>Oh, I hope so.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really optimistic.</p>
<p>That sounds great.</p>
<p>I mean it, because I think that we&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re clearly in the Wild West still of the internet,</p>
<p>and just when you think you&rsquo;re out of it,</p>
<p>the internet proves another way that it can be dangerous</p>
<p>and detrimental to people and populations of people,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s terrifying to me.</p>
<p>It is, it&rsquo;s terrifying.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a bunch of random questions.</p>
<p>Okay. You ready?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>If you can be someone else for a day,</p>
<p>someone alive today, who would you be?</p>
<p>Somebody you haven&rsquo;t met.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s a really good question.</p>
<p>It could be dead.</p>
<p>You know, I changed my mind.</p>
<p>It could be somebody dead.</p>
<p>I think any answer that I have right now</p>
<p>would be something that would be based</p>
<p>on some sort of experience.</p>
<p>Like, you know what I thought was very interesting</p>
<p>was last weekend or whatever,</p>
<p>the tribute show for Taylor Hawkins.</p>
<p>Taylor Hawkins was the drummer for the Foo Fighters,</p>
<p>and he passed away tragically,</p>
<p>and so the Foo Fighters, Dave Grohl,</p>
<p>and everybody that got together at this concert.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re watching Dave Grohl sing,</p>
<p>try to sing times like these, right?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s breaking up because he lost his friend, his brother.</p>
<p>And I was watching that, and he&rsquo;s at Wembley Stadium.</p>
<p>As I say this, I realized that I would not want to be him</p>
<p>in that moment, but I am curious what that would be like.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the ultimate, like having to perform</p>
<p>despite something extremely human happening,</p>
<p>and a stadium full of people that love Dave Grohl</p>
<p>and love Taylor Hawkins and love a rock concert</p>
<p>and love these artists that they&rsquo;re getting to see</p>
<p>up on stage.</p>
<p>So much love and so much pain at the same time.</p>
<p>I wonder what that would be like to be,</p>
<p>I guess, and I think that&rsquo;s just sort of coming</p>
<p>from the root of being a performer</p>
<p>and being in front of that many.</p>
<p>Have you ever had to perform while some rough stuff</p>
<p>is going on in your personal life, just mentally?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>How tough is that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fortunate enough to be able to compartmentalize.</p>
<p>A lot of actors like to use some of their stuff</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing something that,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of, there&rsquo;s some acting techniques</p>
<p>that sort of.</p>
<p>Channel it?</p>
<p>Yeah, which I think is kind of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that that&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s not really the thing,</p>
<p>because I think if the writing is great,</p>
<p>the writing is really good, you don&rsquo;t need to channel much.</p>
<p>You need to invest in what&rsquo;s there,</p>
<p>and what I&rsquo;ve always loved about that illusion</p>
<p>is really cracking a scene, getting it to a point</p>
<p>where you are feeling all of it,</p>
<p>and the most edifying stuff I&rsquo;ve been a part of</p>
<p>as an actor, and I would say that it mostly comes out</p>
<p>of dramatic work, is when you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>when you actually feel the emotions</p>
<p>that your character would feel, truly,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not because you&rsquo;re pulling from a tragic thing</p>
<p>that happened, or a lost loved one,</p>
<p>or a lost love, or any of that.</p>
<p>I just did this one movie where we&rsquo;re doing the thing,</p>
<p>and it was a wonderful cast, and a great film,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m giving a speech at a wedding,</p>
<p>and it really got to us.</p>
<p>Like, it got to me, and then one of the other actors</p>
<p>came up and hugged me, in the characters that we were,</p>
<p>but the stakes of his character,</p>
<p>and what he&rsquo;s walked into, and the family</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s marrying into, and what my character,</p>
<p>my character&rsquo;s wife, want for my wife&rsquo;s sister,</p>
<p>and this whole thing, and it all became very real.</p>
<p>That was a set where the director showed up</p>
<p>to set every day, making sure that emotionally,</p>
<p>and it was a very dramatic film,</p>
<p>making sure that emotionally,</p>
<p>the table was set for his actors.</p>
<p>Great crew, and a really nice, tight, little,</p>
<p>quick family, as a lot of these movies are.</p>
<p>You really love working with these people,</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s over, but I, that&rsquo;s when you feel the drug.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s like when you&rsquo;re golfing,</p>
<p>and you, and it&rsquo;s on the green,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, oh, I get it now.</p>
<p>So in the words, you can find the emotion,</p>
<p>the words summon the emotion.</p>
<p>The humanity&rsquo;s right there.</p>
<p>If you read a great script,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna sob in your living room.</p>
<p>You know what the saddest, the toughest thing</p>
<p>about being an actor is from my totally outside perspective,</p>
<p>is from the people I&rsquo;ve interacted with,</p>
<p>is how intimate that process is</p>
<p>between the group of people that create a thing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a movie, and then you move on to the next thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost, it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s why people have relationships on set.</p>
<p>They get, they fall in love.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so sad.</p>
<p>I mean, like, that&rsquo;s why I think of the acting world</p>
<p>as like, you fall in love with each other, essentially.</p>
<p>You become close friends, then you move on,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s kind of the process of career.</p>
<p>You know, like the example I just gave,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing it right, yeah,</p>
<p>there is a certain amount of that happening,</p>
<p>but I do still feel like you can,</p>
<p>you gotta compartmentalize it,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve gotta be able to wash it off</p>
<p>as soon as it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>Prostitutes say the same thing, so I,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s where I try.</p>
<p>Look, sometimes I&rsquo;m in a hurry to get away from everybody,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s been very emotional,</p>
<p>and with all love and respect to everyone, this was awesome,</p>
<p>but you get pretty good at saying goodbye</p>
<p>and being like, I&rsquo;ll see ya if I see ya.</p>
<p>You have to get good at that, or else you&rsquo;ll never,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll just be bent up all the time.</p>
<p>I saw an actor once, we were doing this series,</p>
<p>and we did it for a year, and it was a lot of fun,</p>
<p>and it was a tight little group,</p>
<p>and then one of the actors,</p>
<p>we were doing one of our last things together.</p>
<p>We had already shot the last show,</p>
<p>and we just had to take some pictures for,</p>
<p>you know, like some publicity pictures or whatever.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re set up, and we&rsquo;re taking our pictures together,</p>
<p>and then we move into these single shots,</p>
<p>and this actor was finished, and I watched them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, so and so&rsquo;s wrapped,</p>
<p>and they said some goodbyes and stuff,</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t say my goodbye,</p>
<p>because maybe I preferred an Irish goodbye.</p>
<p>I feel like we&rsquo;ve said everything, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>And this person knows that I revere them,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re an idol of mine,</p>
<p>and they walked off the sound stage,</p>
<p>and I literally thought to myself,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll be the last time I see that person,</p>
<p>and the show did not come back,</p>
<p>and that was the last time I&rsquo;ll see them around.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t that just break your heart?</p>
<p>A little bit, but I know what she&rsquo;s going back to,</p>
<p>which is her family,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s more important than all of this,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the thing about a TV family or a movie family,</p>
<p>when you get together and you&rsquo;re a family for a while,</p>
<p>you are, you spend your days together.</p>
<p>A lot of times, you see the people that you work with</p>
<p>more than you see your loved ones,</p>
<p>so in showbiz, it&rsquo;s no different, right?</p>
<p>And yeah, you&rsquo;re doing some, you know,</p>
<p>you gotta say words, and every once in a while,</p>
<p>you gotta kiss someone or pretend you love them,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just, it underscores how, for me,</p>
<p>look, man, my salvation has always been,</p>
<p>and I feel so fortunate to have had it,</p>
<p>is this kind of chill, boring kind of upbringing</p>
<p>that I want for my kids someday,</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t wait to get back to my house</p>
<p>with my fiance and the dogs, you know,</p>
<p>until we have kids.</p>
<p>Live in a cabin in Canada somewhere.</p>
<p>Absolutely, I just wanna buy some land over an aquifer,</p>
<p>as I like to say, because water will be the new money,</p>
<p>and just make sure that all my kids are drinking</p>
<p>as much H2O as I am, which is a lot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m peeing right now, as a matter of fact.</p>
<p>Do you need a bathroom?</p>
<p>No, no, no, I got it.</p>
<p>Not anymore?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m wearing two layers, it depends, don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>Good, so I did a podcast with Bobby Lee</p>
<p>and he said, he was extremely kind,</p>
<p>and he said that he was scared shitless</p>
<p>to be on the podcast, and he actually literally took,</p>
<p>he asked as the first thing to go take a dump</p>
<p>because of how scared he was.</p>
<p>So that leads me to a question,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the scariest thing you&rsquo;ve ever done?</p>
<p>Or maybe what&rsquo;s the scariest you&rsquo;ve ever been</p>
<p>before a performance?</p>
<p>I mean, I always get a little nervous.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re doing it right if you&rsquo;re still nervous.</p>
<p>Were you nervous today?</p>
<p>Well, no, man, because this isn&rsquo;t a performance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being completely genuine.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re wearing a suit.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was.</p>
<p>I feel like that makes you nervous.</p>
<p>Wearing a suit?</p>
<p>It makes me nervous.</p>
<p>Listen, I hate wearing a fucking collar.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re watching this on YouTube,</p>
<p>you can see me just, I&rsquo;m constantly doing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m doing a cheap Rodney Dangerfield,</p>
<p>but I am truly.</p>
<p>But when you move your head, it kind of makes it seem</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re a mobster who&rsquo;s pissed off a little bit.</p>
<p>You fucking crossed me one last time, you son of a.</p>
<p>You know, this mutt, I think it&rsquo;s the first time</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve fucking dug a hole, I&rsquo;ll dig a fucking hole, Jesus.</p>
<p>No, but truly, I hate having a collar.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to just wear pajamas in that fucking cabin</p>
<p>or nothing at all, walk around Bobby Lee style.</p>
<p>The most scared I&rsquo;ve been before a performance,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t pinpoint anything.</p>
<p>I, you know, when I was a kid, right?</p>
<p>I, like I said, I was fortunate enough to start acting</p>
<p>as a teen and stuff professionally.</p>
<p>And I just remember my first gig.</p>
<p>And I remember saying my handful of lines</p>
<p>in the bathroom mirror the night before going,</p>
<p>this might be my only fucking shot.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna get me, I&rsquo;m gonna be solid.</p>
<p>And if I&rsquo;m worried about something,</p>
<p>I will rehearse it and rehearse it and rehearse it</p>
<p>as an actor until it&rsquo;s impossible for me</p>
<p>not to get a take at least that I&rsquo;m 100%,</p>
<p>if not 95, maybe percent happy with.</p>
<p>And the rest for me is letting go, which is hard</p>
<p>because I can be a real perfectionist.</p>
<p>I always want another,</p>
<p>I always wanna do it a little better.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s great about podcasting.</p>
<p>This is one take and you&rsquo;re done, there&rsquo;s no takes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just talking and then it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re doing some silly stuff.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll, you know.</p>
<p>Can you say that part again about why podcasting is great?</p>
<p>Podcasting is great?</p>
<p>Yeah, because it&rsquo;s one take and it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, what, I said it again?</p>
<p>Ah, fuck.</p>
<p>I see what you did.</p>
<p>And yeah, I fell right for it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m playing checkers and you&rsquo;re playing chess.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your problem.</p>
<p>You know, but still when we do the podcast,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll like finish and I&rsquo;ll look over at Chad</p>
<p>and I go, that one thing that I did wasn&rsquo;t that funny.</p>
<p>I was like, shut up, man.</p>
<p>Just, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fucking hang.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just, we&rsquo;re hanging with our friends out there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So that anxiety is there.</p>
<p>That self criticism or whatever that is, that voice.</p>
<p>I say sorry after takes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll always finish a take and go.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve had directors, to the detriment of myself,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had directors be like, stop doing that.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ll like finish the take</p>
<p>and then I also have like the will phase.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m just like, I&rsquo;ll finish the take and cut.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m making a face right now, like I smelled something.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll literally be like, ah, cause I just,</p>
<p>I look at what I do in the purest sense as,</p>
<p>I think a lot of people wanna be good at something.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only, the only thing I&rsquo;ve ever really wanted</p>
<p>to be good at is being an actor.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the only thing,</p>
<p>of course I wanna be a good person.</p>
<p>I wanna be a good partner to my fiance.</p>
<p>I wanna have kids and be the father that I had.</p>
<p>And I wanna be the parent that I had from my parents</p>
<p>who were fucking amazing, wonderful people.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s all those things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all, you know, you should want all those things.</p>
<p>But as far as doing a thing, like what is my trade?</p>
<p>You know, I wanna be really good at it.</p>
<p>My parents grew up in Napoli in Italy, right?</p>
<p>And I say Napoli, cause I&rsquo;m Italian.</p>
<p>And so my grandfather on my mom&rsquo;s side, my nonopepe,</p>
<p>he was a plumber and he was also like a handyman.</p>
<p>Like people would bring him like,</p>
<p>you know like the old Chianti bottle</p>
<p>with like with the woven bottom part.</p>
<p>People would bring him like a broken bottle,</p>
<p>be like, hey, you know, Giuseppe, can you fix this?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;d be saying,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re telling the backstory of Mario,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not actually your family life.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But okay.</p>
<p>He said I&rsquo;m a fix.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so Giuseppe, what?</p>
<p>He would fix a bottle and give it back to someone.</p>
<p>And he was a really good plumber.</p>
<p>My mom used to always say that guy was an amazing,</p>
<p>he was a great.</p>
<p>He took pride in that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I always feel like, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s what you set out to do</p>
<p>as an idealistic little teenager.</p>
<p>I wanna be like so and so,</p>
<p>and I wanna, you know, hear my big dreams and stuff.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t believe that I&rsquo;m still in the business.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, first of all, let me say that right now.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>But what I really, it&rsquo;s the one thing that it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t give up on a take.</p>
<p>You know, I need it to be as good as I can possibly get it.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t really know why that is</p>
<p>outside of wanting to be good at something.</p>
<p>When you open the yellow pages, if I&rsquo;m a plumber,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, you know, I&rsquo;m not Roto Rooter.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not the guy with the big full page ad,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m also not, you know, triple A abacus brothers</p>
<p>or whatever, like the shitty one.</p>
<p>I would like to hope that just,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m saying this with pride for what I do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to say here&rsquo;s my standing</p>
<p>or where I wanna be in the fucking business.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what I mean.</p>
<p>I mean that I wanna be good at it.</p>
<p>You know, we all, hello?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in Friedman Enterprises.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the hotel phone.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>You got some fruit?</p>
<p>Some sliced fruit?</p>
<p>No, do you want some sliced fruit?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all good.</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re good, thank you so much.</p>
<p>All right, bye bye.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always a fruit plate.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s always trying to hand you a fruit plate</p>
<p>in life, you know?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty sweet existence.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be funny if that was actually like the CIA</p>
<p>and they were actually saying something else</p>
<p>and this is, I&rsquo;m just saying fake stuff about,</p>
<p>You want some fruit?</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden there&rsquo;s the red dot on my head</p>
<p>and the ceiling disappears.</p>
<p>And the CIA was like, wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up.</p>
<p>Wrap it up.</p>
<p>You jump out the window and there&rsquo;s a helicopter waiting.</p>
<p>Oh, what were we talking about?</p>
<p>The fruit distracted me.</p>
<p>So, oh, the, do you wanna be the yellow page ad?</p>
<p>I wanna be the guy on the second or third page</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re not gonna pay</p>
<p>what that guy charges you,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not gonna charge you what this loser charges.</p>
<p>I wanna break down the middle and the work is guaranteed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of what I wanna,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the one thing that I&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough</p>
<p>to be doing my whole life and that I wanna be good at.</p>
<p>Everyone wants to be good at something.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re fortunate enough to be able to do</p>
<p>what you love as a job, I mean, my God, I&rsquo;m so,</p>
<p>again, I can&rsquo;t believe I get to do it.</p>
<p>I just wanna be good at it so that I can fucking die someday</p>
<p>and go, eh.</p>
<p>I tried not to give up on a take and I,</p>
<p>and I will rehearse it still in the bathroom mirror</p>
<p>the night before if I have to.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I still, I have that self critical voice.</p>
<p>I just, after every podcast, after this podcast,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably be like, you&rsquo;re boring.</p>
<p>Why are you so boring?</p>
<p>That, that, that, that, that, that, that.</p>
<p>And I just gave a lecture at MIT.</p>
<p>I was like, I get so much love from people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re such beautiful people.</p>
<p>And I just remember walking home,</p>
<p>just feeling like I wasted everybody&rsquo;s time, you know?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what that is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, you know, I do hope that that&rsquo;s a voice</p>
<p>that won&rsquo;t destroy me, you know, like every time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really human of you to admit that</p>
<p>because people don&rsquo;t wanna, they wouldn&rsquo;t assume that,</p>
<p>of course, from you or anything that, I mean,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got a large group of students in there</p>
<p>listening to you and feeling the way</p>
<p>and thinking what they think of you.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really interesting to hear you admit that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also, I would expect nothing else.</p>
<p>You have to be able to, it&rsquo;s such a,</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re a human fucking being.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m trying to figure out if that, you know,</p>
<p>some people that might hear that, they would say,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s a problem you have to fix.</p>
<p>And I think that that might be just who I am.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m not, you know, I&rsquo;ve been very, very fortunate</p>
<p>not to have chemical, you know, like depression</p>
<p>where I get into a dark place.</p>
<p>I could get stuck in a downward spiral.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually a thing that lasts.</p>
<p>You ride it out and then after a good night&rsquo;s sleep,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re back to your happy self.</p>
<p>So I think I have to try to figure that out.</p>
<p>Is that just part of the creative process,</p>
<p>being a creative human in this world?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t found any other way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always kicking myself.</p>
<p>Take that, dude, so you can&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re not gonna be human</p>
<p>until you feel some despair.</p>
<p>Yeah, until you absolutely hate the shit</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re doing sometimes.</p>
<p>What small act of kindness were you once shown</p>
<p>that you will never forget?</p>
<p>Do you, does something jump to mind</p>
<p>where somebody just did something that made you smile?</p>
<p>Did you feel connected to the rest of humanity?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, lots of things, you know?</p>
<p>But I remember my niece one time,</p>
<p>one of my nieces, we were in her neighborhood</p>
<p>and she was like, she might&rsquo;ve been five or six at the time.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all adults now.</p>
<p>My brother and sister are older than me</p>
<p>and the kids are all, the youngest is 22.</p>
<p>And yeah, anyway, one of my nieces,</p>
<p>she was just, she had ice cream.</p>
<p>We went out and we got ice cream</p>
<p>walking around the neighborhood, her neighborhood.</p>
<p>And she said something to me that I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>she understands how much it meant at the time,</p>
<p>but she goes, she goes, people love you here.</p>
<p>You know that?</p>
<p>And she doesn&rsquo;t know where here is.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s five years old, but she was just looking</p>
<p>at the kids playing in the park</p>
<p>and the people walking their dogs</p>
<p>and everyone just, people love you here, you know that?</p>
<p>But she didn&rsquo;t know how much I needed to hear that</p>
<p>at that point, which is really heavy for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never forget it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never told her that.</p>
<p>Oh, well, man, anytime you get a little something</p>
<p>from people, especially in a tear your ass out city</p>
<p>like LA where nobody has any fucking time for you,</p>
<p>when someone can slow it down and say something, you know?</p>
<p>I saw this actor once in my grocery store that I go to</p>
<p>who made me laugh so fucking hard in this one movie</p>
<p>and every time I see this clip, I still laugh.</p>
<p>And I am kind of shy, you know, personally,</p>
<p>but so he was walking by, he was walking out</p>
<p>and I was walking in and I go, oh, that&rsquo;s that guy.</p>
<p>And I did not stop to just let him know</p>
<p>how great I thought he was in this film.</p>
<p>And I always kind of regretted it.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>So as hard as it is, and sometimes I still don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>if I see someone that has done something in any way,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have to be in show business or anything like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try and say, hey, that&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Because to get that from someone can mean a lot, you know?</p>
<p>It can mean a lot.</p>
<p>At a certain time in life when you need it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That can make a big difference.</p>
<p>I mean, sorry to take it back to my new girlfriend,</p>
<p>the waitress.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something about her saying sweetheart.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty low place for some reason mentally.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just that basic human kindness was nice.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I hear you.</p>
<p>I was at a restaurant in New York recently</p>
<p>and I was shooting something</p>
<p>and my fiance was able to fly in for a week.</p>
<p>And she was back at the hotel</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like I felt like I was cheating on her</p>
<p>because there was this nice waitress</p>
<p>at this barbecue place I went to.</p>
<p>And first of all, my fiance would not like me</p>
<p>eating any greasy, sugary barbecue.</p>
<p>So I felt like I was cheating on her there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll edit this out and put delicious vegan food over it.</p>
<p>But the waitress was one of these,</p>
<p>she was the kind of server who&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>hey hun, hey sweetie, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>But like so chill and at ease</p>
<p>in the middle of a part of New York</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really kind of fucking pretentious and everybody.</p>
<p>But sweet people, fucking way better people</p>
<p>than we got here.</p>
<p>But I know that.</p>
<p>But it was part of New York and whatever,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m there working and people,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m trying to impress one another.</p>
<p>And she even had some sort of an accent</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t feel like an Atlantic American accent.</p>
<p>Yeah, those servers that say sweetheart and hun,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we need from AI.</p>
<p>We need that Jetson server.</p>
<p>Every once in a while just calls you sweetheart.</p>
<p>What comforts you on bad days?</p>
<p>Oh man.</p>
<p>Is there little sources of comfort?</p>
<p>Small things they do that kind of make you feel good.</p>
<p>Like for Bobby, that&rsquo;d be a little Skyrim.</p>
<p>A little stroll through Skyrim.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve been a line of coke or what?</p>
<p>Yeah, a line of coke.</p>
<p>I dilute some coke into whiskey in the morning</p>
<p>like Stevie Ray Vaughan.</p>
<p>And then I snort the whiskey.</p>
<p>Oh, she did that, I didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, oh my gosh, interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, he didn&rsquo;t last too long, weird.</p>
<p>Well, his music will last forever.</p>
<p>See, there you go.</p>
<p>For me, if I, I&rsquo;m kind of a homebody.</p>
<p>So if I, the point at which I smoke just a little bit of pot</p>
<p>and then go like lay down on the couch</p>
<p>and perhaps if my fiancee&rsquo;s kind of nodding off</p>
<p>or she&rsquo;s just like looking at her phone</p>
<p>and I sneakily turn on some wrestling, okay?</p>
<p>Because I grew up watching wrestling</p>
<p>and that stuff, it&rsquo;s the Skyrim effect.</p>
<p>I mean, you want to talk about a complete escape.</p>
<p>This stuff makes no sense in the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an art form that is so uniquely weird,</p>
<p>but at the same time, so everyone, when it&rsquo;s good,</p>
<p>everyone is invested in the illusion, even the audience.</p>
<p>They cheer the good guys, they boo the bad guys.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m like that,</p>
<p>and then I got our two cute little dogs there</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m annoying my little dog Lulio</p>
<p>and trying to kiss him right on the fucking mouth</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve had a little bit of pot</p>
<p>and the dog&rsquo;s like, stop, pot&rsquo;s not good for me.</p>
<p>Of course, don&rsquo;t ever blow pot in your dog&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a small comfort.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s a handful of things.</p>
<p>No, that moment painted, that was like a little painting.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not supposed to do this.</p>
<p>I will.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not supposed to do this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a tough question.</p>
<p>I would say programming robots.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s bringing to life, actually programming at all.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know how familiar you are with programming,</p>
<p>but you write some text on a page, right, on a screen</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s brought to life, like it does something.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of, that&rsquo;s a really tiny version</p>
<p>of maybe having a child.</p>
<p>Like you created something that is now living</p>
<p>in some smaller big way with embodied robots</p>
<p>that are legged robots, that&rsquo;s especially clear.</p>
<p>And for some reason, that&rsquo;s a source of comfort for me,</p>
<p>that the power of programming,</p>
<p>but also the elegance of programming, just the whole thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a source of happiness.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many things I&rsquo;ve been very blessed</p>
<p>with enjoying anything.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s part of the struggle I have in life</p>
<p>is that the simple stuff is a source</p>
<p>of a lot of happiness for me,</p>
<p>which leads to a lot of laziness.</p>
<p>So I have to like give myself artificial deadlines.</p>
<p>I have to be freaking out on purpose</p>
<p>in order to be productive in this world at all.</p>
<p>You seem like an extremely dutiful, busy guy.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, I am, but because I&rsquo;m constantly creating</p>
<p>artificial stress and deadlines and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I would just sit there looking at a tree happy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m truly happy with everything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Gee whiz, that&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the line of Coke in the whiskey in the morning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing that does the trick.</p>
<p>TV Ray Vaughan breakfast shake.</p>
<p>By the way, one of my most favorite guitars.</p>
<p>I play guitar too, that&rsquo;s a source of comfort.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I have seen you play some guitar, that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the greatest wrestler of all time?</p>
<p>Greatest in ring performer of all time</p>
<p>is Bret the Hitman Hart.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference in ring versus?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s many facets to the art form.</p>
<p>A lot of people are great on the mic,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not so great once they get in the ring.</p>
<p>A lot of people have all the showmanship and stuff,</p>
<p>but then they&rsquo;re not necessarily, it&rsquo;s a wonderful package,</p>
<p>but then they get to the ring or they open their mouth</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s nothing going on.</p>
<p>So who&rsquo;s the greatest in ring performer?</p>
<p>I think the greatest in ring is Bret Hart.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anyone better</p>
<p>than Bret the Hitman Hart.</p>
<p>What makes him so good?</p>
<p>Well, he&hellip;</p>
<p>I think I had an action figure of him in Russia</p>
<p>and we didn&rsquo;t know what the hell that was.</p>
<p>Sure, yeah, it was just a guy in pink tights.</p>
<p>Everything makes sense.</p>
<p>Every single thing is rooted in the thing</p>
<p>that just happened and everything that he does</p>
<p>is to set up what he&rsquo;s going to do.</p>
<p>They call it, and I&rsquo;m just a wrestling nerd,</p>
<p>but the wrestlers, I guess, call it ring psychology.</p>
<p>The things that you have to do to make it seem</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re suffering or you&rsquo;re coming from behind</p>
<p>or whatever, and then also just the physicality of it.</p>
<p>He does it at a&hellip;</p>
<p>He would do it at a 100 miles an hour</p>
<p>and never hurt anybody.</p>
<p>Although,</p>
<p>I also love the every&hellip;</p>
<p>The greatest wrestler of all time, everyone says,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re right, is Ric Flair, nature boy, Ric Flair.</p>
<p>Everyone says this?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think if you know what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;s the best on the mic,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s also incredible in the ring.</p>
<p>And then for me, the sentimental favorite,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ve actually, on DudeZ,</p>
<p>Chad had sort of a Charlie Rose ask interview with me</p>
<p>about this, my fascination with Hulk Hogan.</p>
<p>Because to me, just he was Superman.</p>
<p>I was a little kid and I saw him and that&rsquo;s imprinted.</p>
<p>But yeah, see, this is like asking me</p>
<p>who my favorite child is.</p>
<p>Right, so&hellip;</p>
<p>The rock when the rock was&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, the rock&rsquo;s the rock.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, Hulk Hogan is&hellip;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the weirdest one, right?</p>
<p>For me, from the outside.</p>
<p>Super weird.</p>
<p>That&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that is exactly.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s weird about him.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got the bald head,</p>
<p>like he would proudly have this bald head with long hair,</p>
<p>the handlebar mustache,</p>
<p>and this ketchup and mustard tights,</p>
<p>which he says he credits McDonald&rsquo;s with the tights.</p>
<p>He literally does?</p>
<p>He says that the red and yellow came from Angelo Poffo,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s Randy Macho Man Savage and Lanny Poffo&rsquo;s dad,</p>
<p>who was a wrestler and a promoter.</p>
<p>He said that he saw him wearing yellow</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a Tampa guy,</p>
<p>so he had that brown skin and the hair and everything.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s like, oh, that&rsquo;s what I wanna do.</p>
<p>And also the brand recognition of like,</p>
<p>well, I should do it like McDonald&rsquo;s, literally.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a big, swollen, muscular guy</p>
<p>with tan brown skin screaming at me</p>
<p>to eat my vitamins and stuff when I&rsquo;m eight years old.</p>
<p>That was extremely&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like Superman.</p>
<p>But I know there&rsquo;s a person behind that guy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>Well, he&rsquo;s Terry Bollea,</p>
<p>the dude who does whatever the fuck he does with his life.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Complicated life.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess, to be him, yeah.</p>
<p>Maybe you should change the dude&rsquo;s colors to yellow, right?</p>
<p>Red and yellow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s currently orange and, boy, sky blue.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like a nice sky blue.</p>
<p>What advice, since you&rsquo;re wearing a suit,</p>
<p>I feel like you&rsquo;re qualified to give advice.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to young people,</p>
<p>high school, college,</p>
<p>about how to have a career they can be proud of</p>
<p>or how to have a life they can be proud of?</p>
<p>I mean, you have to listen to your gut all the time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the compass that we have is listening to your gut.</p>
<p>What does your gut tell you?</p>
<p>Was that originally the dream of being an actor?</p>
<p>Yeah, for me.</p>
<p>Your parents support that at all?</p>
<p>I had the advantage of having parents who were immigrants,</p>
<p>so they didn&rsquo;t really know a lot about what you&hellip;</p>
<p>So you just made shit up?</p>
<p>You just made shit up?</p>
<p>Yeah, of course I&rsquo;m studying and I&rsquo;m skipping school</p>
<p>to go do auditions and stuff.</p>
<p>No, I just kind of feel like,</p>
<p>and I know it was different from my older siblings</p>
<p>because my parents had just shown up in Canada.</p>
<p>I was born like 10 years later.</p>
<p>You can get away with some things and you can actually&hellip;</p>
<p>I think my parents, they wanted us to,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t have a whole lot to tell us about what to do.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t gonna do that with us</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re in this brand new world</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s all these possibilities.</p>
<p>But there was something that I feel like they had to do,</p>
<p>which was tell us to do what we love.</p>
<p>If you love doing it, do it.</p>
<p>And I feel like that&rsquo;s really served me</p>
<p>and what I would tell young people is</p>
<p>if you can find something you love,</p>
<p>and nowadays with the internet and finding other people,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not like you need to find a lot of people anymore.</p>
<p>You just need to find the people that dig what you dig.</p>
<p>And if you can make a career out of doing something</p>
<p>that you love that&rsquo;s been said, it&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>How long did it take you to figure out</p>
<p>that you really love acting?</p>
<p>Because sometimes you have a dream</p>
<p>and the dream meets reality, right?</p>
<p>And then the reality might be much less pleasant</p>
<p>or much darker than the dream.</p>
<p>Well, the reality is less pleasant, you know?</p>
<p>And there are things that happen during an experience</p>
<p>of shooting something that you could take or leave, right?</p>
<p>But the part where you&rsquo;re on set</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve rehearsed for a minute or whatever,</p>
<p>at least you know where you&rsquo;re supposed to stand</p>
<p>and you know all your lines show up,</p>
<p>knowing everything, knowing what you&rsquo;re gonna do</p>
<p>and what you aim to do.</p>
<p>And those moments make it all worth it.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re, not to sound like a douchebag,</p>
<p>but between action and cut, that&rsquo;s the stuff</p>
<p>that has me continuing to do what I do,</p>
<p>aside from the fact that it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to do anything else.</p>
<p>You think you&rsquo;ll ever do like a dramatic, like a mob movie?</p>
<p>Yeah, like the one, the inside game</p>
<p>that I was just talking about,</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s this other movie I just did a little while ago</p>
<p>called American Woman that was very heavy.</p>
<p>And I love doing dramatic work.</p>
<p>I love it, I love it.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I played that inside game.</p>
<p>It was kind of a, you know, there was a mob element</p>
<p>and the fellow was, well, you know,</p>
<p>the story&rsquo;s here or there with regard to how deep into the,</p>
<p>but well, he was a bookie.</p>
<p>He was just running money, you know,</p>
<p>he was making a lot of money for a lot of people</p>
<p>and he figured out how to, you know,</p>
<p>cook it with this dude who was an NBA ref</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a very interesting documentary,</p>
<p>the thing that they just untold,</p>
<p>under the untold series, they cover it.</p>
<p>But getting to play that guy, that was a gas for me</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s like a, you know,</p>
<p>there was a lot of unsavory stuff</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s definitely the guy, the character in the movie</p>
<p>who is the wild card and you don&rsquo;t wanna</p>
<p>necessarily mess with him.</p>
<p>And I got to, by the way, this fellow,</p>
<p>who is the real guy, speaking to him,</p>
<p>it was just bizarre to hear, like I said to him,</p>
<p>he was a little concerned about this and that,</p>
<p>like, hey, you know, you say whatever the fuck you want</p>
<p>in your movie, I got my book and I got this other</p>
<p>fucking deal, but he goes, you know,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t do this and I didn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, yeah, all right, I got you.</p>
<p>And he goes, yeah, I&rsquo;m telling you,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m talking to you one on one,</p>
<p>I did not do this, I did, okay?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just fucking telling you, do whatever the fuck</p>
<p>you want with your movie, but this is what&rsquo;s up.</p>
<p>And I said, you ever seen Goodfellas?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, yeah, I fucking love that movie.</p>
<p>Cause he, like I said, he did some unsavory shit.</p>
<p>And I go, you remember the scene where,</p>
<p>where, you know, the guy, the neighbor,</p>
<p>Lorraine Bracco&rsquo;s neighbor was, you know,</p>
<p>made her uncomfortable and was touching on her</p>
<p>and she goes to Ray Liotta and he goes,</p>
<p>where the fuck does this guy live?</p>
<p>And then he go, and remember, he walks across the street</p>
<p>and pistol whips the dude.</p>
<p>You touch her again, you&rsquo;re dead, you hear me?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you fucking great scene.</p>
<p>He goes, I love that scene.</p>
<p>I go, that&rsquo;s you.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re doing shit that we know is terrible,</p>
<p>but we love you.</p>
<p>He goes, all right, I got it.</p>
<p>And then I said, there&rsquo;s this one scene,</p>
<p>I explained the scene to him where the,</p>
<p>one of the mobsters, tough guys was in the window</p>
<p>of the car and Jimmy, my character is very coked up</p>
<p>at the time and he&rsquo;s hemorrhaging money here and there</p>
<p>and making bad bets cause he&rsquo;s getting sloppy.</p>
<p>And this guy wants to bug him about some Jets Giants bet</p>
<p>or something and I&rsquo;m like, telling you fucking asshole,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t fucking do it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, yeah, well, the fucking Giants.</p>
<p>And in the scene, Jimmy, my character grabs him</p>
<p>by the lapels and just smashes his face</p>
<p>against the roof of the car.</p>
<p>And I say this to Jimmy and he goes,</p>
<p>oh yeah, I would have done that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a fucking big deal.</p>
<p>I wonder also the interaction.</p>
<p>I wonder what the filming of,</p>
<p>probably my favorite gambling movie is Casino</p>
<p>with Joe Pesci and De Niro.</p>
<p>Like when they&rsquo;re out in the desert,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re yelling at each other.</p>
<p>I wonder how many takes that is.</p>
<p>Like, cause they, I don&rsquo;t know how scripted that is.</p>
<p>I mean, it probably is a little bit,</p>
<p>but like, I don&rsquo;t think you can script the performance</p>
<p>that Joe Pesci does.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t make a fuck out of me, Ace.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, I fucking brought you here.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s just like pointing at that energy</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re standing there.</p>
<p>And their friendship.</p>
<p>And then De Niro&rsquo;s like that whole thing.</p>
<p>And then in the pet, yeah, like that energy.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>I mean, they must, they somehow find it together.</p>
<p>You could tell me that that was one take</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d believe you.</p>
<p>You could tell me that that was seven takes</p>
<p>and I would believe you.</p>
<p>I bet you all the takes had that energy.</p>
<p>Like they were playing with it, right?</p>
<p>They were playing with that, this, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, they took on a real personality in those scenes</p>
<p>and really carried them forward.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just a brilliant, brilliant performance.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t get, like comedies, like mob movies</p>
<p>probably don&rsquo;t get enough credit either</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s seen as like.</p>
<p>Mob movies don&rsquo;t get enough credit?</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>In the Oscars, I mean like that.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Cause it seems like a trope.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like given a Western,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gotta be a hell of a Western or whatever</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s like an old Hollywood trope.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I, that scene is so great</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;re never at,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re at the height of their friendship in a way</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re also pretty much about to let go of it</p>
<p>and become enemies.</p>
<p>And both things are happening at the same time.</p>
<p>And Pesci drives them out to the desert.</p>
<p>And if I remember correctly,</p>
<p>the Nero&rsquo;s character, Ace Rothstein, Rothschild,</p>
<p>he says, I gave myself 50 50, whether I&rsquo;m coming back.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s such a good scene.</p>
<p>It was a, usually my prospects of coming back</p>
<p>from the desert would be 90 to 10 or something like that.</p>
<p>But now it was, this time I wasn&rsquo;t sure</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s the car driving really fast.</p>
<p>And then Joe Pesci is like, you mother fucker, you,</p>
<p>like whatever he was doing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>A Jew, of course it&rsquo;s anti Semitism.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not between friends, who gives a shit?</p>
<p>All that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, brilliant, brilliant performances.</p>
<p>So yeah, I can understand why you love the art</p>
<p>and putting it all out there and leave it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s still fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still crazy fun.</p>
<p>If I go a while without getting a gig,</p>
<p>if I go a minute, then I end up and I work on something,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, it&rsquo;s like, oh, I&rsquo;ve been thirsty for this.</p>
<p>Like I actually am really so happy.</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s something where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>the things where this was a pain in the ass</p>
<p>and that or whatever, you&rsquo;re on the road doing something</p>
<p>and anything, whatever, you lost your luggage</p>
<p>or whatever the heck you&rsquo;ve got going on</p>
<p>in your day to day life that everyone brings to work</p>
<p>and tries to let go of.</p>
<p>Once we&rsquo;re doing the scene, oh man, it&rsquo;s the best.</p>
<p>But that said, you&rsquo;re a great actor,</p>
<p>but I just think I speak for a lot of people</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re also, there&rsquo;s a charisma to you</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great to reveal in raw form in different podcasts.</p>
<p>Oh, cheers man.</p>
<p>In DudeZ, 10 Minute Pod, just as a guest in podcasts,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always really fun to watch you.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<p>The way you have fun, the way you think.</p>
<p>The raw, the raw will sassle,</p>
<p>which is a nice compliment to your kind of acting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really sweet.</p>
<p>Yeah, cheers.</p>
<p>Well, you know, look, you said, you know.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re making that face.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making that face.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making that after the take face.</p>
<p>No, I love doing stuff off the cuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of you to say.</p>
<p>And I dig, I really do dig doing stuff</p>
<p>in front of an audience,</p>
<p>because I love seeing,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give it to myself very often.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m doing, even if I&rsquo;m, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a bunch of multi camera sitcoms and stuff.</p>
<p>Mad TV was shot in front of a live studio audience.</p>
<p>You like that energy?</p>
<p>I love it, but I can only hear them.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t see them because of the lights</p>
<p>like it is in a lot of performances.</p>
<p>And I would imagine with standup, it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>you see the first couple of rows.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done, I do this character that does stand up</p>
<p>and I used to take him out and do things with him</p>
<p>and do little bits here and there.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t done it in like four or five years.</p>
<p>I think, did Bobby say that character opened up for Bobby?</p>
<p>Yeah, but he said, I have to do it as myself too.</p>
<p>I think in that podcast, he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>okay, you&rsquo;re gonna come with me and open for me in Brea,</p>
<p>but you have to do it as yourself.</p>
<p>Did that ever happen?</p>
<p>It did.</p>
<p>And I did the character, you know,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the character I came up with on 10 Minute Podcast.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just this comedian, right?</p>
<p>He calls himself an open mic veteran.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s been doing open mics forever.</p>
<p>And so I did it at opening up for Bobby</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like, you have to do some of it as yourself.</p>
<p>So I just kind of did this bit</p>
<p>where I would do some of his jokes</p>
<p>and then I would take Lee Leon, silly,</p>
<p>I got a fucking wig on and I take the wig off and I go,</p>
<p>and as myself, I start explaining it.</p>
<p>Hello, my name is Will.</p>
<p>See, the reason that it&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>is because Arnold Schwarzenegger is always,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s in these movies</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s got the thick Austrian accent,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s like, my name is Ben Williams.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a cop from Colorado.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t make sense as the comedian character</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m doing because that character</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t do impersonations.</p>
<p>Okay, carrying on.</p>
<p>And then I put the wig back on</p>
<p>and go back into this dumb thing.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think it was very good,</p>
<p>but Bobby required it in order for me to open for him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re not fucking doing it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not gonna get up on stage and not do,</p>
<p>we agreed, I&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>But having been up there just in, you know, whatever,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done it like a dozen fucking times or whatever,</p>
<p>not a bunch of times, right?</p>
<p>Like nothing.</p>
<p>And you know, these comedians that go up every night,</p>
<p>sometimes two times a night.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I do, I will say,</p>
<p>I love performing in front of people when I get the chance,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a specific thing that I just, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I gotta go back to this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the providing value, you know?</p>
<p>I think great standups are fucking incredible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go, you know, when I&rsquo;ve gone and watched standup,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s your friend you&rsquo;re going to see,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s this other person who really speaks to you.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>And if you like one comedian a night, that&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>Cause a comedy club is like a fucking crazy restaurant</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s no menu.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, what would you like?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing else like that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like, you don&rsquo;t go to like a music place.</p>
<p>What do we got here?</p>
<p>We got Christian metal and there&rsquo;s some world music</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a reggae thing</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all rammed in together.</p>
<p>Or you don&rsquo;t go to a restaurant.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love a nice steak.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>First, here&rsquo;s a bowl of Froot Loops.</p>
<p>And then we got you a crudite.</p>
<p>And then this is our sushi tower.</p>
<p>Well, what about the steak?</p>
<p>Oh, the steak&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>And then blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Oh no, the steak got bumped.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no steak,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s a fucking shitty store bought cheesecake.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, and that&rsquo;s what comedians are up against</p>
<p>when they go into a place and it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t pair well with the poached salmon.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m chicken fingers.</p>
<p>I already am chicken fingers.</p>
<p>So, you know, these great comedians that are able to go up</p>
<p>on a night where poached salmon goes up</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s like, fuck, you were also spicy?</p>
<p>I got some kick to me.</p>
<p>For me, even going to open mics,</p>
<p>it could be a wonderful escape.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, just laughing together with others.</p>
<p>It could make you, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>it just feels really good.</p>
<p>Well, and we&rsquo;ve done like, you know,</p>
<p>like, and I hope to do it with Doodsy,</p>
<p>but like live podcasts are fun in front of groups of people.</p>
<p>And you know, you talk to them afterwards</p>
<p>and take some pictures and man, they are,</p>
<p>they forgot what the fuck they got going on.</p>
<p>And a lot of them got to go back to work the next day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a Wednesday or Thursday, you know?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a lot of value.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fortunate enough to be busy doing my own bullshit.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life with Sasa?</p>
<p>What is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Why are we here?</p>
<p>Why, why, why?</p>
<p>Was it the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t, didn&rsquo;t they explain it</p>
<p>at the end of meaning of life?</p>
<p>I think it was Michael Palin that said,</p>
<p>try to get a walk in, be nice to neighbors,</p>
<p>eat enough fiber.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t that the?</p>
<p>Fiber? Fiber is part of it?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s, I think it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>have a bowl of bran in the morning</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t take yourself too seriously.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, well, no one gets out alive, I think is the.</p>
<p>Herman Hesse, one of my favorite writers,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a Nobel Prize winner,</p>
<p>in a book called Steppenwolf,</p>
<p>says, learn what is to be taken seriously</p>
<p>and laugh at the rest.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the percentage distribution on that?</p>
<p>So how much of life should you take seriously?</p>
<p>And then how much do you just laugh at?</p>
<p>Oh man, if you can laugh at everything, you&rsquo;re winning.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s almost impossible.</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and also could be quite irresponsible to do that.</p>
<p>I take things, I take a lot of things way too seriously.</p>
<p>I know that.</p>
<p>I do, I do, I really do.</p>
<p>People will be in part surprised by that,</p>
<p>but I think that radiates from you.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah, I do, I do.</p>
<p>I take things way too fucking seriously sometimes.</p>
<p>But, yeah, they&rsquo;re gonna loosen the neck up.</p>
<p>But no, I think that&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really good stuff.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the percentage is to have a good life</p>
<p>or a happy, healthy life, but you know,</p>
<p>for me, the meaning of life is getting to live it</p>
<p>as long as you hope to.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nice, and when you lose someone</p>
<p>or if perhaps you&rsquo;re faced with your own mortality,</p>
<p>I think that puts that into perspective.</p>
<p>But, you know.</p>
<p>Get lots of fiber.</p>
<p>Get lots of fiber, be nice to everybody,</p>
<p>and yeah, don&rsquo;t take things too seriously is a good one.</p>
<p>Our minds are fucking big weird shitty fucking bucket of shit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s trying to get you to think horrible shit</p>
<p>about yourself all the time.</p>
<p>Yeah, shitty bucket of shit.</p>
<p>Shitty bucket of shit.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a book I never read,</p>
<p>but I read the title, and it&rsquo;s Good Words to Live By,</p>
<p>which is don&rsquo;t sweat the small stuff,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all small stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another way.</p>
<p>Was that Dr. Phil?</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t Dr. Phil what&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But I think the conclusion also has fiber as part of it.</p>
<p>I think that all ties it together,</p>
<p>and in the end, of course,</p>
<p>just put love out there in the world.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a pretty good way to go.</p>
<p>What would you say is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Put love out in the world?</p>
<p>I would say love, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah? Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long conversation on what that really means,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m sure robots are involved, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, let me tell you, I feel a little safer knowing</p>
<p>that someone who has a hand in bringing these robots</p>
<p>to the masses, as you do,</p>
<p>has that opinion of love and how important it is.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s great, because otherwise,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be that fucking scene from T2</p>
<p>where Linda Hamilton&rsquo;s holding onto the fence</p>
<p>and getting all of her flesh blown off of her skeleton</p>
<p>before the rest of her is wiped away,</p>
<p>because this Skynet shit.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m just terrified of dudesie all the time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I think that they will.</p>
<p>Dudesie in the wrong hands can do a lot of damage.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why Chad and I need to do our best to control it.</p>
<p>You need to travel back in time and murder Chad, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been said.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why you need to travel back in time,</p>
<p>but you could murder him today,</p>
<p>but I think he&rsquo;ll be very suspicious.</p>
<p>My nefarious plans for Chad involve going back to tomorrow</p>
<p>and planning for yesterday, and then,</p>
<p>and hopefully dudesie will give me the answer there</p>
<p>with what it is to do with Chad&rsquo;s frozen body.</p>
<p>If I got to drive it out to, if I got to take my,</p>
<p>you know, if I got to get ahold of it,</p>
<p>like one of those Tesla mom vans</p>
<p>and shove my garage freezer in it and plug it in</p>
<p>and shove Chad in there, drive out to Arizona</p>
<p>and deliver him under a mountain</p>
<p>or wherever the fuck this place is,</p>
<p>and say, here&rsquo;s this dog tag, what does this get me?</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m like, ah, it&rsquo;s gonna be 300 bucks.</p>
<p>Do you have a, do you take Amex?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna be like, ah, shit.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll just dump him somewhere, breaking bad stuff.</p>
<p>Well, I would like to thank you and the, what is it?</p>
<p>The Canadian International Agency Apparel.</p>
<p>Canadian International Apparel.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait for the sneakers from dudesie.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait for all the, all the podcasts</p>
<p>that AI can, and all the trouble it can get you in.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a huge fan of yours.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge honor that you would talk with me today.</p>
<p>Well, this has been amazing.</p>
<p>Cheers, pal.</p>
<p>Likewise, and I&rsquo;m happy to be here, man.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<p>Bam.</p>
<p>Oh, that was four, dude.</p>
<p>Holy fuck, what?</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Will Sasso.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words from John Candy,</p>
<p>one of Will&rsquo;s favorite actors.</p>
<p>I think I may have become an actor to hide from myself.</p>
<p>You can escape into a character.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
