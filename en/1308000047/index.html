    <p>J. Cal looks like he&rsquo;s going to a night at the Roxbury.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I mean, you look horrible.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Absolutely fucking horrible.</p>
<p>Okay. Appreciate it.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Thanks for coming.</p>
<p>This is the Production Board Symposium 2021.</p>
<p>Tell us just a little bit about why we&rsquo;re here, David,</p>
<p>and what this is and what it represents for the Production Board.</p>
<p>The Production Board Symposium, second ever.</p>
<p>Thank you all for being here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re excited.</p>
<p>We have an amazing group of scientists, engineers,</p>
<p>folks from academia, from business, from the investing community,</p>
<p>some of our investors.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re excited to share thoughts and ideas over the next couple days.</p>
<p>And thought we would chase half of you away by hosting the all-in pod tonight.</p>
<p>So here we go.</p>
<p>Great. Okay.</p>
<p>So first up in the news, Rolling Stone amplifies false</p>
<p>ivermectin story.</p>
<p>You were following this, Chamath.</p>
<p>What do you think this ivermectin controversy and-</p>
<p>You want to give a little summary of what the issue is</p>
<p>before we talk about the hypocrisy of it?</p>
<p>Well, on September 1st, Oklahoma news station K4 ran a story</p>
<p>and published an article on ivermectin overdoses</p>
<p>backing up rural hospitals.</p>
<p>The article was titled Patients Overdosing on Ivermectin</p>
<p>Backing Up Rural Oklahoma Hospitals and Ambulances.</p>
<p>First line of the article, quote,</p>
<p>a rural Oklahoma doctor said patients who are taking the home</p>
<p>dewormer medication ivermectin to fight COVID-19</p>
<p>are causing emergency rooms and ambulances to back up.</p>
<p>On September 3rd, Rolling Stone amplified the story in its own article.</p>
<p>The only problem was they tweeted it with a picture</p>
<p>that featured people lined up in the cold.</p>
<p>It turns out the picture was people waiting for vaccine shots back in January,</p>
<p>not gunshot victims waiting to get into the hospital.</p>
<p>Yeah, the story is totally false.</p>
<p>You understand that, right?</p>
<p>Well, I didn&rsquo;t want to say fake news, but I know-</p>
<p>No, it was beyond fake news.</p>
<p>This was basically a doctored up conjured article by some person</p>
<p>trying to incite a moral mania at Rolling Stone.</p>
<p>Look, you tell me if the science of this is wrong.</p>
<p>The whole premise is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Ivermectin basically, as far as we know, because we don&rsquo;t know that much,</p>
<p>acts on a handful of specific characteristics.</p>
<p>One, we know to be glutamate, which we don&rsquo;t really express</p>
<p>in the same way as fucking worms.</p>
<p>Yes, technically, it can be used as a dewormer,</p>
<p>but there are four or five other ways in which it acts,</p>
<p>which we don&rsquo;t know anything about,</p>
<p>because we haven&rsquo;t taken the time to do a broad-based double-blind study.</p>
<p>I think the fairest thing to say about ivermectin is we don&rsquo;t know what it is.</p>
<p>Neither the people that propose to use it as a solution for COVID,</p>
<p>nor the people that rail against it aren&rsquo;t really starting from the basis of fact.</p>
<p>Then what happens is you have these folks who basically are so turned off by the idea</p>
<p>that people aren&rsquo;t getting vaccines.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to use this other thing.</p>
<p>They basically doctored up an article.</p>
<p>That wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad because nobody reads Rolling Stone, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an ancient brand.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s going there for medical news.</p>
<p>Then the problem is you get a handful of these folks who think they&rsquo;re really,</p>
<p>really smart who amplify it.</p>
<p>Rachel Maddow amplifies it.</p>
<p>Jimmy Kimmel does it on a comedy skit.</p>
<p>Then all of a sudden, there&rsquo;s this enormous outrage,</p>
<p>but the problem is you can&rsquo;t put the genie back in the bottle</p>
<p>when it turns out to be a completely fabricated lie.</p>
<p>Then all the people that are purporting to basically push this lie,</p>
<p>who now have been outed, have no consequences</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re on the left screaming at the right.</p>
<p>What happened when it was the other way around,</p>
<p>we basically started to put people in boxes.</p>
<p>We basically kicked them off these platforms.</p>
<p>Again, you have this compounding building double standard.</p>
<p>That, to me, is the worst part about it.</p>
<p>David, when we look at the ivermectin story,</p>
<p>we also saw Joe Rogan got COVID.</p>
<p>That was a big ha-ha moment for a lot of people.</p>
<p>He took ivermectin as part of his treatment,</p>
<p>and then people started amplifying that he was taking a worm drug for horses.</p>
<p>Dewormer.</p>
<p>Dewormer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at best an antimicrobial.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s used for both situations.</p>
<p>And a doctor prescribed it to him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s thinking of suing some folks for tweeting this.</p>
<p>What does this overall say about the state of communications around this pandemic?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, look, this is really a media story.</p>
<p>You had Rolling Stone publish this article based on a single source.</p>
<p>You have this one crank basically saying that</p>
<p>emergency rooms are turning away gunshot victims</p>
<p>and people having heart attacks, okay?</p>
<p>And all they had to do, all Rolling Stone had to do</p>
<p>was call up any one of these several hospitals,</p>
<p>they immediately would have refuted the source.</p>
<p>But they didn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>They also could have simply googled the number of toxic ivermectin cases</p>
<p>to find out if it was even plausible statistically</p>
<p>that you could have ivermectin overdoses flooding Oklahoma hospitals.</p>
<p>But they didn&rsquo;t do that either.</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t they confirm the sources?</p>
<p>Because the article was too perfect.</p>
<p>It confirmed all of their priors.</p>
<p>Their first prior was about ivermectin.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been waging this war on ivermectin,</p>
<p>claiming it&rsquo;s a horse dewormer when it&rsquo;s actually,</p>
<p>that is one of its purposes, but it&rsquo;s not the only one.</p>
<p>It was a drug designed for humans and it&rsquo;s used against parasites.</p>
<p>Now, as Jamal said, we don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s effective against COVID.</p>
<p>They got to do the double blind studies and then we&rsquo;ll find out.</p>
<p>But that was sort of their first prior.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s face it, the second prior was that this is in Oklahoma, right?</p>
<p>And so Rolling Stone wants to believe you have all these MAGA idiots out in Oklahoma</p>
<p>eating horse paste, okay?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why they love this story so much.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why Rachel Maddow loved the story so much.</p>
<p>And she then starts spreading it, okay?</p>
<p>And after she gets called out, including by, say, Glenn Greenwald,</p>
<p>as of last night, she had not taken it down.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t take it down.</p>
<p>Now, why?</p>
<p>Because she knows there are no consequences for misinformation and lying.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because Twitter and Facebook do not punish people on the left for misinformation.</p>
<p>That is a penalty.</p>
<p>They only meter out for people who disagree with their cultural and political biases.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s part of the secret cabal that gets the get out of jail free card.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even think it&rsquo;s secret.</p>
<p>I just think these people all are part of the same cultural sort of milieu.</p>
<p>They all have the same political and cultural biases.</p>
<p>And there is never&hellip;</p>
<p>Look, where is the Twitter warning, the Twitter label on the Rachel Maddow post</p>
<p>even now saying that this tweet, this article is misinformation?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t exist because it&rsquo;s inconvenient.</p>
<p>Freeberg, let&rsquo;s talk about the science of&hellip;</p>
<p>I think I would pay $40 for all-in podcast live.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dynamic.</p>
<p>It works.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>By the way, you&rsquo;re on the show, so&hellip;</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m here too.</p>
<p>Tell me the last time we heard a news story that didn&rsquo;t have bias to it.</p>
<p>What was the last general thing that was reported</p>
<p>that we didn&rsquo;t feel had the angle that then elicited emotion,</p>
<p>either love or hate or alignment or not?</p>
<p>Well, you can have that reaction to facts.</p>
<p>There was an article in the Wall Street Journal just now</p>
<p>about the Democrats&rsquo; proposal on taxes.</p>
<p>I have an emotional reaction to it, but it&rsquo;s fact-based.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got 100&hellip;</p>
<p>Is it really?</p>
<p>Was it?</p>
<p>My reaction or&hellip;</p>
<p>No, the story.</p>
<p>Yeah, they just said that the House proposal now is to move the cap gains rate from 20 to 25,</p>
<p>the corporate tax rate from whatever it was to 26 and a half.</p>
<p>My point is, there are articles written by folks who just want to get the facts across</p>
<p>and let you judge.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s good or bad, who knows?</p>
<p>Time will tell.</p>
<p>Then there are folks that basically manufacture shit because, again, I think,</p>
<p>and I think it was Matt Taibbi that said this, because it creates moral mania.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, drives the narrative, drives the emotion.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the last grasp of the power of journalism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all they have left at this point,</p>
<p>is just to basically make it a complete fucking free-for-all.</p>
<p>In it, they still have some kind of relevancy.</p>
<p>I have these old New York Times newspapers.</p>
<p>The whole year printed from 1936 through 1944.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in this huge book.</p>
<p>But you must have been out all the time, but you didn&rsquo;t have time to read those.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, but you flip through these things.</p>
<p>They are just like old ticker stories.</p>
<p>It had absolutely no narrative attached to it.</p>
<p>There was no&hellip;</p>
<p>These are the people, almost the implicit right and wrong,</p>
<p>the implicit morality of every decision that&rsquo;s being made,</p>
<p>of everything that&rsquo;s being reported on.</p>
<p>I have a feeling the only thing that&rsquo;s going to be left in like 10 years is the economist,</p>
<p>and then the mob rule in the metaverse.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, I mean, you also have podcasts where people can discuss these things</p>
<p>in maybe a more honest, transparent way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a few great podcasts like that.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mr. Anti-Facebook, what do you think about this Wall Street Journal article that</p>
<p>says that there&rsquo;s a secret cabal that basically gets a get-out-of-jail-free card on Facebook,</p>
<p>and nobody else does?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s millions of people, though, it said, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>You work there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exactly the point I&rsquo;ve been making, right?</p>
<p>Which is that there&rsquo;s two sets of rules.</p>
<p>If you are part of the in-crowd, if you share the cultural biases,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re part of the same class, whether it&rsquo;s socioeconomic or political or whatever,</p>
<p>that of the people who are doing the content moderation, doing the censorship,</p>
<p>you get a get-out-of-jail-free card.</p>
<p>The rules are different for you.</p>
<p>You can be Rachel Maddow and post an article that&rsquo;s complete bullshit,</p>
<p>and even after the entire Twittersphere calls you out, you don&rsquo;t post a correction.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t get labeled, you don&rsquo;t get censored.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re on a different part of the political spectrum, you do.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s two sets of rules.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think it&rsquo;s insane.</p>
<p>I mean, this is exactly what I think people have been saying for</p>
<p>a long time when people say, oh, you know, it&rsquo;s algorithmic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really human-controlled.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no real intervention.</p>
<p>And then you find out there&rsquo;s actually literally something called cross-check,</p>
<p>which its definition is, check the algorithm and override it with my own bias.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the definition of what the feature is.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, whenever we start down this censorship route, like,</p>
<p>who gets to decide, and then what is their motivation?</p>
<p>Even if they have pure motivation, there&rsquo;s no way to, you know, not read into that.</p>
<p>Assume the platforms die.</p>
<p>Assume everything deplatforms and decentralizes.</p>
<p>And then, like, all media is through Substack or through</p>
<p>the call-in app or through other kind of media.</p>
<p>Decentralized, crypto-based, blockchain, Twitter.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no longer a platform.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no longer a censor model.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going to end up happening?</p>
<p>People are going to click on the stuff that they want to hear.</p>
<p>Confirmation bias.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to become more extreme.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to become, you know, even more heated.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be splintering of media creation as there is right now that we see today, right?</p>
<p>Every element of the spectrum will be kind of produced.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to end up clicking on the stuff that creates the greatest emotional response.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s what people like to consume.</p>
<p>How does a citizen who wants to inoculate themselves from fake news bias,</p>
<p>how do you recommend they go after science?</p>
<p>And how do they have to learn this stuff for themselves?</p>
<p>They have to try to become an expert themselves?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>Like anything that&rsquo;s hard, right?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s got to be a will.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that that&rsquo;s really, it&rsquo;s not to be discouraging.</p>
<p>I just think that it&rsquo;s a lot easier to not do that, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a lot easier to consume ice cream all the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot more fun to consume ice cream all the time than to kind of plan your diet,</p>
<p>eat healthy and work out and all this sort of stuff.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s really where, you know, media, like a lot of things is headed</p>
<p>as we create these kind of feedback loops that are all, because everything&rsquo;s digital,</p>
<p>everything ends up becoming a feedback loop.</p>
<p>I bet you, I bet you.</p>
<p>If you look inside, because like now some rabid politician will get ahold of this Facebook</p>
<p>crosscheck thing.</p>
<p>I bet you, if you look and graph the number of people that were essentially whitelisted</p>
<p>from being able to say whatever the hell they want, versus what was popular on Facebook,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d see a left versus right distribution very clearly.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d basically see it, because if you look at it now, I think there&rsquo;s a, I can&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>his name, but he&rsquo;s a, he&rsquo;s a former New York Times reporter that tweets out every day,</p>
<p>the top 10 links that are shared on Facebook.</p>
<p>Kevin Roose.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a fucking train wreck.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like one normal article.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s like nine, like right-wing conspiracies.</p>
<p>Infowars, Ben Shapiro, Daily Wire.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a train wreck every day.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a hipster sitting in East Menlo Park, at some point the cuffs in your jeans</p>
<p>are rolled up too tight.</p>
<p>The fucking shirt cuffs are rolled up too tight.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re just freaking out.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re like, we need to create something.</p>
<p>What do we call it?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re like, crosscheck.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden what happens is you just start introducing people, hoping that</p>
<p>then the list that gets published every day on Twitter changes.</p>
<p>But then what happens actually is you find the exact opposite thing happens.</p>
<p>That people are so like, they sniff out the bullshit.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, what is going on here?</p>
<p>But then they double down.</p>
<p>And the next thing you know, Ben Shapiro&rsquo;s nine, eight of the 10 top stories every day</p>
<p>on Facebook.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how you have Donald Trump and everything else.</p>
<p>Next topic.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I don&rsquo;t want to belabor it.</p>
<p>They did it to themselves.</p>
<p>Yeah, look, I think both sides are capable of, both sides of the political spectrum are</p>
<p>capable of spreading misinformation and bullshit.</p>
<p>And you have to vary your information diet, right?</p>
<p>I mean, if all you do is participate in, you know, the right wing or left wing echo chamber,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to buy into the ivermectin hoax.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be story here from Rolling Stone or whatever it is.</p>
<p>So you have to make an effort to, again, to vary your information diet.</p>
<p>Or mask, or the lab leak theory.</p>
<p>The lab leak theory, exactly.</p>
<p>We now have five of these during the pandemic alone, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But see, what I object to is the fact that the censorship rules only seem to apply to</p>
<p>one side of the spectrum.</p>
<p>Is look, both sides are capable of spreading misinformation, but only one side is being</p>
<p>censored.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because the people running these powerful tech companies agree.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, you know, 90 plus percent of that political persuasion.</p>
<p>That is not healthy.</p>
<p>Can we survey the audience and see if they agree?</p>
<p>Raise your hand if you agree.</p>
<p>How many people agree with Sachs that Trump should be reinstated on all platforms?</p>
<p>All right, there you go.</p>
<p>How many people agree that the tech platforms have a political bias?</p>
<p>How many disagree with that statement?</p>
<p>Nobody.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So tell Phil, Phil, call him out, call him out.</p>
<p>My wife is the chief business officer of Facebook.</p>
<p>Thanks for the viewers.</p>
<p>Tell us, let us check in with you after the next vesting date.</p>
<p>Requisite hand raise.</p>
<p>For the viewers at home who couldn&rsquo;t see that because I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Do we have the audience on camera?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So it was 99 percent.</p>
<p>Everyone.</p>
<p>Everyone except for Phil Deutsch.</p>
<p>Well, these are Silicon, best described as Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>To Barney.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why he had to raise his hand.</p>
<p>No, but to be clear for people listening.</p>
<p>Phil&rsquo;s wife works at Facebook.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got to say no.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s OK.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s OK.</p>
<p>But everybody else here agreed with that.</p>
<p>And these are all people who are in the tech industry.</p>
<p>They know.</p>
<p>They know.</p>
<p>So how many of us are Democrats?</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re all mostly Democrats, I would guess.</p>
<p>How many people voted Democrat in the last election?</p>
<p>How many are not Democrats?</p>
<p>How many people voted for Trump?</p>
<p>Raise your hand.</p>
<p>Nice and high.</p>
<p>Nobody.</p>
<p>Nobody.</p>
<p>No, literally, there&rsquo;s only that&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a question I have.</p>
<p>OK, so we are we are firmly going down because I think it&rsquo;s pretty it&rsquo;s pretty clear to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be willing to make the bet that the media is on the side of vaccine mandates.</p>
<p>OK, they want the top down control and the sense of theoretical safety that a vaccine mandate</p>
<p>gives them in their own little bubble.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why I think they support this.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, blowing up Ivermectin was kind of a method of many that they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>undertaken to do that, whether we believe in vaccine mandates or not.</p>
<p>But now it&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s coming in the L.A. school district.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s you know, Biden is trying to push this thing through the BLS.</p>
<p>This is going to be a very, very big deal.</p>
<p>What do you guys think is the right thing to do on vaccine mandates, irrespective of</p>
<p>all we&rsquo;re going to hear over the next?</p>
<p>Government government or private employer mandates or both?</p>
<p>Well, we should let&rsquo;s walk through it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using both for the government, government employees.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with that.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, the government mandate.</p>
<p>No, it goes through the BLS.</p>
<p>It says any company, public or private, that is 100 employees or more.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I think we all agree that people in the military or people in health care,</p>
<p>they should all be vaccinated or they shouldn&rsquo;t come to work, correct?</p>
<p>Well, but that&rsquo;s also not not even enforceable.</p>
<p>Like Sorkin, Andrew Ross Sorkin tweeted out like he had to take his kid to the urgent</p>
<p>care and he walked in and the doctors weren&rsquo;t wearing masks or something.</p>
<p>Yeah, I read that and said something about like not being vaccinated.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter or blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>And he like, well, that goes to enforcement.</p>
<p>But I mean, moral and liberal military has said, I thought, wait, you brought your kid</p>
<p>to the fucking urgent care.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you first need to know what&rsquo;s wrong with the kid?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t prosecute this person&rsquo;s opinion on masks and vaccines before you figure out</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s wrong with your kid.</p>
<p>Well, what do you think, sex, military, military health care teachers?</p>
<p>I think the crux of the issue is whether employers should be able to require that.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s two issues.</p>
<p>One is whether employers should be allowed to require it, which I think everybody agrees.</p>
<p>Not everyone, but but most people, I think, agree that private employers and you could</p>
<p>lump the government in with this should be allowed to test or their employees or require</p>
<p>their employees be vaccinated if they want to.</p>
<p>And or at least I would support that part of it is let private enterprises require vaccination</p>
<p>if they want, if they decide, hey, in order to come back to the office, you got to be</p>
<p>vaccinated for everyone&rsquo;s safety, they can impose those rules.</p>
<p>Now, the question is, do we need to go beyond that to have a federal mandate?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m anti vaccine.</p>
<p>I just think that&rsquo;s like an awfully authoritarian thing to do.</p>
<p>And it raises a bunch of questions.</p>
<p>So for example, I have a friend who owns a chain of dry cleaners, okay?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got over 100 employees, mostly minimum wage in a bunch of different locations.</p>
<p>About 20% of his</p>
<p>What is his ethnicity?</p>
<p>What does that have to do with anything?</p>
<p>Just curious.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s Sri Lankan.</p>
<p>Anyway, so</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the third most famous Sri Lankan American.</p>
<p>Anyway, so he&rsquo;s got 100 employees, about 20% of them are anti vax,</p>
<p>and they will not get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Okay, so they will walk out.</p>
<p>If you know if this is required to do that job, hold on.</p>
<p>But he can&rsquo;t run his business.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a 20% walkout, he just can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>Okay, so now we get to the soft part of the mandate, which is, well, instead of requiring</p>
<p>the VAX, he can do a weekly test.</p>
<p>Well, we did that outside here.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s going to pay for those tests?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s going to administer them?</p>
<p>Is it like, you know, they had a nurse out here with the full, you know, you know,</p>
<p>hazmat.</p>
<p>Yeah, the hazmat thing.</p>
<p>So, you know, that&rsquo;s not cheap.</p>
<p>So who&rsquo;s going to pay for that?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s going to do that?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the documentation around that going to be?</p>
<p>Is that get logged into the computer system?</p>
<p>What kind of proof is it?</p>
<p>Does it require a trip to the lab?</p>
<p>Or is this something we can do in five minutes?</p>
<p>I mean, look, if we had done what Freeburg said a year ago on this pod, we should do,</p>
<p>which is have these $1 five minute tests be available everywhere.</p>
<p>Then maybe that sort of rapid test out would make these mandates more palatable.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t have that yet.</p>
<p>You know, there aren&rsquo;t enough of these.</p>
<p>It turns out we still need it even with the vaccines, because no vaccine is going to be</p>
<p>100% effective.</p>
<p>And with rights, but my point is, since we don&rsquo;t really have that solution operationalized,</p>
<p>you know, having a hard VAX mandate on 100 million employees of private enterprises,</p>
<p>you know, that&rsquo;s going to cause, I think, chaos in the economy.</p>
<p>What if we get a variant, David, or if we get a variant, God forbid, that is more dangerous</p>
<p>than Delta, let&rsquo;s say it spreads just as fast, but it&rsquo;s five times as deadly.</p>
<p>Does that change your thinking about this mandate?</p>
<p>And where do you stand on the mandate?</p>
<p>No, I think the mandate in this very specific narrow instance makes sense.</p>
<p>And I think what we should be fighting about is how we actually write it so that it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>wholly expansive.</p>
<p>And the reason is because we know that there is a probabilistic distribution of outcomes</p>
<p>where a non-trivial percentage of them results in a variant that is deadly.</p>
<p>And so we can understand the math and we can understand a sense of time to figure out that</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t do something, and if we don&rsquo;t get to some amount of control around what this is,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all in really big trouble.</p>
<p>So because of that specific thing, I just think this is where, look, the president has</p>
<p>the ability to invoke the War Measures Act to do all kinds of things that are super normal.</p>
<p>And we would never say that those abide in normal times.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve created a framework for him to be able to do those things in non-normal times</p>
<p>and then revert to normal.</p>
<p>I think this is one of those cases just because I don&rsquo;t think the economic consequences and</p>
<p>the social consequences, if we let this thing continue to compound and continue to</p>
<p>mutate, it doesn&rsquo;t make any fucking sense.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not learning anything.</p>
<p>We could have used the War Mandate Act across two presidencies to demand some companies</p>
<p>make a dollar test.</p>
<p>We have 7580 tests approved in Germany, they&rsquo;re down to two or $3.</p>
<p>Why has the FDA not gotten us to that level that Germany&rsquo;s at?</p>
<p>And why haven&rsquo;t we done the War Mandate Act?</p>
<p>I mean, we have like a constructed capitalist model of like, let the free market tell the</p>
<p>government what is the right thing to do.</p>
<p>And so then they invite Abbott and they invite the guys in and they&rsquo;re like, you know, the</p>
<p>White House, they have a consortium meeting.</p>
<p>And everyone&rsquo;s kind of a little bit chuckling about this.</p>
<p>Like, oh, this is awesome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another $2 billion payday, which is what they just got.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you saw the write up today, but the federal government is paying Walmart</p>
<p>for the difference between the wholesale cost and the retail cost so that consumers</p>
<p>cannot now go buy Abbott tests at the wholesale price at the store $2 billion taxpayer money</p>
<p>gone.</p>
<p>When we could have had a bunch of smart scientists get together at the White House with a bunch</p>
<p>of engineers take over a friggin factory and on a piece of paper, print 8 billion fucking</p>
<p>tests, and then chop them up and distributed them for 50 cents.</p>
<p>And instead, we have this problem where we&rsquo;re like, depending on the Korean supply, I could</p>
<p>you not have the test kits that are like plastic, that&rsquo;s where they make all the like</p>
<p>pregnancy test kits and all this stuff.</p>
<p>And these this like the commercial model is like, tell us how you want to make these tests,</p>
<p>tell us what the right model is.</p>
<p>And of course, you end up with a $30 test when in Germany, you can go buy a 50 cent</p>
<p>test at any liquor store.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s constructed straight up corruption.</p>
<p>And if you go back, like, you know, I don&rsquo;t know if you know, the production boards named</p>
<p>after the trade into the microphone named after the war production, which was set up</p>
<p>during World War Two humble.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty humble.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Took the war out.</p>
<p>You know, but it was, but the idea was like, how do you take a system level design approach</p>
<p>to solving kind of big problems.</p>
<p>And one of the issues that we had during World War Two was a supply chain problem on making</p>
<p>tanks and planes.</p>
<p>And so they put together a bunch of smart people.</p>
<p>Deutsch knows this better than anyone.</p>
<p>Because he was alive back.</p>
<p>He was alive.</p>
<p>And he was sitting in the front guys.</p>
<p>Well, you have the hand before he dies.</p>
<p>He may die in the factory floor.</p>
<p>Old as fuck.</p>
<p>And and there was basically a coordinated effort.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s his birthday today, by the way.</p>
<p>Sorry, but I&rsquo;m happy birthday.</p>
<p>Um, but there was a coordinated effort by engineers at the top down to design a system</p>
<p>for making these things cheap and fast.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an approach that I think we lost, right?</p>
<p>Like, we kind of gave way to this model of laissez faire.</p>
<p>Like, you come in, you tell me what you think we should do.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s a good idea.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take photos.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re out.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Like, we don&rsquo;t have a wartime mentality right now.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t had a wartime mentality since COVID hit.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s continued to try and parade around and get reelected and, you know, earn votes.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re basically not, we&rsquo;re not taking this seriously.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not acting.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re, you know, like every, every time kind of a business or a government or any organization</p>
<p>goes through a phase, it goes through a wartime phase or a peacetime phase.</p>
<p>We should be acting like we&rsquo;re in a wartime phase.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a question?</p>
<p>If you may, three or four of us basically pony up some money,</p>
<p>could you go and print 8 billion of these fucking tests?</p>
<p>In the US, you cannot get them approved without the FDA.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not asking for approval.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying, could you do it?</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>And how long would it take?</p>
<p>You could buy some old frigging paper mill in three months.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, this is actually people in this room who could do this in.</p>
<p>Now, isn&rsquo;t there a framework within FDA that basically allows you to effectively</p>
<p>experiment on yourself?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a compassion.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s for drugs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for therapeutics, not for diagnostics.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying that if I want to build my own test and use it,</p>
<p>if you want to build it, if you want to build a diagnostic test that tells them on whether</p>
<p>or not they have an illness, you have to get FDA approval in the United States.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s also published the summary statement is regulatory capture,</p>
<p>like is one of the biggest issues and related news.</p>
<p>By the way, another insane statistic.</p>
<p>Just sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>I saw this today.</p>
<p>I forgot.</p>
<p>Someone we know tweeted this.</p>
<p>The who wants to guess the ratio of administrators to doctors in the US healthcare system?</p>
<p>300 to 1.</p>
<p>Yeah, I saw 300 to 1.</p>
<p>900 to 1 today.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>And that is up from 5 to 1 in 1970.</p>
<p>By the way, can I just build on what you said?</p>
<p>900 to 1.</p>
<p>Your initial tweet said 300 to 1.</p>
<p>And it ended in 2010, right before Obamacare passed.</p>
<p>So from 300 to 900 was all Obamacare.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Regulatory capture.</p>
<p>Saks is shaking his head.</p>
<p>Which by the way, nothing against Obamacare, because I think like coming as a Canadian,</p>
<p>I actually believe in subsidized healthcare.</p>
<p>And I think the principle of Obamacare was great.</p>
<p>But there was one fatal flaw, which is it basically said, okay, you know what,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re capped at the following margin.</p>
<p>And the minute that people said, wait a minute, I can only have a 20% gross margin.</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<p>You just jack up prices to basically jack up revenue.</p>
<p>Because if you can only take 20%, you&rsquo;re going to take 20% of a bigger number than a smaller</p>
<p>number.</p>
<p>And so it completely burned the incentives for any healthcare company in the United States</p>
<p>to do anything other than just basically walk prices up.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s funny, because if you look at the stock prices of these companies, you would</p>
<p>have made more money being long United Healthcare than you would have been owning Facebook,</p>
<p>Google, any of these other tech companies in the last decade.</p>
<p>Crazy stat.</p>
<p>Speaking of regulatory capture, Tesla got left out of this new tax credit or proposed</p>
<p>tax credit.</p>
<p>Insane.</p>
<p>For electric cars.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you saw that.</p>
<p>But Tesla wasn&rsquo;t invited a couple of months ago to Biden&rsquo;s EV summit.</p>
<p>Elon responded like, I wonder why I wasn&rsquo;t invited.</p>
<p>It turns out it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re not a union shop.</p>
<p>Their employees make much more money than union employees make.</p>
<p>And now as a punishment, but hold on, as a punishment, the $12,000 credit that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>giving to or they&rsquo;re proposing to give to all EV manufacturers is only if you have</p>
<p>union employees, it&rsquo;s 4500 less to Tesla.</p>
<p>So literally, two massive regulatory captures and corruption go or maybe sacks.</p>
<p>No, I mean, I don&rsquo;t have much more to add to that.</p>
<p>I mean, you hit the nail on the head.</p>
<p>I mean, this is to serve the unions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not to serve clean energy, or the EV industry.</p>
<p>I mean, a little bit for you, but it&rsquo;s mostly for the unions.</p>
<p>The, on the one hand, what we do is we say that climate change is this existential issue.</p>
<p>But then when the rubber meets the road, if you look inside the infrastructure plan today,</p>
<p>we unveiled basically how we&rsquo;re going to do all the tax credits.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s just an enormous amount of just sloppy regulatory capture.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doubling and tripling credits in certain places.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re disallowing credits in other places.</p>
<p>When you follow the dollars, what happens is you can map it to companies, those companies tend to</p>
<p>be mostly public, large balance sheets, large lobbying efforts.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not necessarily the most important companies that matter.</p>
<p>So if I said to you, what are the most important companies in climate change?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d probably say, well, maybe it&rsquo;s direct air capture.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s nuclear.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s some other thing that basically helps you go to a different place.</p>
<p>And where does all the tax credits and tax dollars go?</p>
<p>Sunrun, Sunpower.</p>
<p>These are companies that basically have this oligopolistic stranglehold on essentially</p>
<p>installing solar panels and battery walls in homes across the United States.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not to say that that job isn&rsquo;t important.</p>
<p>But to basically explicitly block other people out, because all the chatter today on,</p>
<p>or some of the chatter today was around just if this bill passes as written,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to see these stocks rip.</p>
<p>And so obviously, the positive reinforcement loop of Wall Street and hedge funds getting</p>
<p>behind these companies, their market cap goes up, the amount they allocate to lobbyists</p>
<p>go up, and then all this bullshit just continues to cycle through the system.</p>
<p>Freeberg, how far are we away from small nuclear reactors and fusion,</p>
<p>just from a science perspective, and then on a regulatory basis?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know enough.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah.</p>
<p>Look, I mean, from what I&rsquo;ve seen, there, there are great technologies that, you know,</p>
<p>we should be able to kind of realize my understanding and speaking to investors,</p>
<p>some in this room, and I know Chamath looked at this area a lot,</p>
<p>is, you know, there&rsquo;s the regulatory burden that&rsquo;s made it so difficult to launch nuclear.</p>
<p>Technically, it seems like there&rsquo;s great breakthroughs.</p>
<p>There was an announcement from a group this past week,</p>
<p>CFS, yeah, on a new superconducting magnet system that they spent years designing.</p>
<p>This is a Bill Gates backed company.</p>
<p>Anyone here an investor?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>And basically, it enables like the tokamak plasma fusion based systems</p>
<p>to be kind of reliably produced now.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;ve had a proof of demonstration of this, of the superconducting magnet system</p>
<p>that effectively allows you to control a plasma, which is like 10 million degrees Celsius,</p>
<p>in a little donut that spins around.</p>
<p>And that plasma allows you to kind of pull energy out that can be used for, you know,</p>
<p>effectively, you put a bunch of material in, this thing runs,</p>
<p>and more energy comes out than you put in, it&rsquo;s magic.</p>
<p>And so, you know, this has been a theoretical kind of concept for decades.</p>
<p>Getting the superconducting magnet system to control the plasma in a very small space,</p>
<p>using a very small kind of system was proven.</p>
<p>And now they think that they&rsquo;re, you know, call it four or five years away.</p>
<p>You know, by the way, everything in nuclear is always four or five years away.</p>
<p>So four or five years away with a grain of salt,</p>
<p>from kind of having a demonstrable kind of system.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s technologies that are clearly like on the brink or proceeding nicely.</p>
<p>But as we know, a lot of a lot of these sorts of technologies,</p>
<p>similarly, are kind of regulatory burdened.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re about 100 degrees away, I think, from a from an operational,</p>
<p>functional room temperature, semiconductor, and superconductor, sorry.</p>
<p>And, you know, I&rsquo;ve told a team that I&rsquo;m working with on this project,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to go into energy generation,</p>
<p>or unless we can do it in a small form manufacturing thing that can be adopted broadly.</p>
<p>But if you try to go and, you know, basically build some distributed energy resource</p>
<p>out over here, that powers Cavallo point, it&rsquo;s impossible, because you run into these people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t really understand the science won&rsquo;t take the time.</p>
<p>And, you know, we&rsquo;ve taken so many steps backwards from nuclear,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s probably just going to take decades.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to take some cataclysmic climate change event,</p>
<p>where the only way out is this super abundant energy source,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re willing to basically say, ah, fuck it, we&rsquo;re fucked otherwise.</p>
<p>By the way, if you were to go to Mars today, you wouldn&rsquo;t be pulling a bunch of fucking,</p>
<p>you know, oil out of the ground and burning it and, you know, rotating,</p>
<p>you should, I mean, and you wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily I mean, you&rsquo;d be using,</p>
<p>you know, solar at the beginning, but you wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily rely on solar the,</p>
<p>you know, the cost of material to transport from here to Mars,</p>
<p>to yield the best energy potential would likely be some sort of nuclear power source, right?</p>
<p>As it is in a lot of military systems.</p>
<p>Question, Saks.</p>
<p>Elon was saved by Obama.</p>
<p>I mean, just kind of like having we were there, meaning like,</p>
<p>you know, it was in that moment, he was able to get that deal with Daimler,</p>
<p>he was able to get these, you know, tax credits, the auto bailout, you know, all of that stuff.</p>
<p>But then it seems like we&rsquo;re in the middle of a democrat administration,</p>
<p>and they may go out of their way to basically try to fuck this guy.</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s like become a special interest free for all.</p>
<p>There was an article today that the national deficit year to date is 2.7 trillion.</p>
<p>And I think that we&rsquo;re on October 1st fiscal year, so there&rsquo;s one more month,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;ll be about 3 trillion.</p>
<p>Last year was over 3 trillion because of COVID.</p>
<p>There haven&rsquo;t gotten to the infrastructure bill yet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna be another 1.2 trillion.</p>
<p>On top of that, the Democrats are saying they want another three and a half.</p>
<p>Well, not all Democrats, but thank God for Joe Manchin, but another three and a half trillion.</p>
<p>And, you know, most people can&rsquo;t even really say what&rsquo;s in that three and a half trillion dollar</p>
<p>bill.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s we&rsquo;re at 28 trillion, something like that of national debt.</p>
<p>I mean, and it&rsquo;s all just like special interest plunder.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, if you look at the results, the results aren&rsquo;t there, correct?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then on top of that, well, you know, I understand, I mean, with respect to Obamacare,</p>
<p>okay, that&rsquo;s a major item on, let&rsquo;s call it the Democrat wish list was to give everyone</p>
<p>health care.</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t even get there.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But you can sort of understand that.</p>
<p>But most people, I think even on the left, can&rsquo;t really say what the big ticket item</p>
<p>is that&rsquo;s going to be delivered for this three and a half trillion that is proposing to be</p>
<p>spent.</p>
<p>So, I mean, it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s just become this like, you know, special interest freefall.</p>
<p>Freeberg, we talked about not having a wartime stance with the pandemic.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a wartime stance with global warming or extreme weather, whichever term</p>
<p>you want, should we?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re burning money out of like a drunken salary.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on right now.</p>
<p>And actually, a lot of what we&rsquo;re going to talk about this symposium over the next day</p>
<p>or so, is that there is effectively now a raging free market appetite for these solutions.</p>
<p>The capital is pouring in the entrepreneurship is blossoming, ballooning, the technology</p>
<p>is advancing.</p>
<p>So, you know, to some degree, folks might say, you know, this is going to get solved.</p>
<p>But there are major infrastructure solutions that are needed for us to accelerate the outcome</p>
<p>and win the war.</p>
<p>And those infrastructure solutions aren&rsquo;t going to get funded by SoftBank.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not going to get funded by Chamath.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to need to get funded by a type of dollars.</p>
<p>I mean, keep keep you keep building your book like you are, you will fund them in the next</p>
<p>decade.</p>
<p>But sacks, you know, kind of speaks to the kind of numbers that I think, you know, are</p>
<p>necessary here.</p>
<p>I mean, you think about how much money we spent on COVID without any results over the</p>
<p>last year, it really begs the question, if we were kind of to take an ROI based approach</p>
<p>to where we spending these dollars, this would probably be the first on the list.</p>
<p>And by the way, the private market and jobs will benefit.</p>
<p>And what happened in this, this, this bill, this infrastructure bill this past this past</p>
<p>year, that&rsquo;s now been, you know, more kind of definitively drafted is a bunch of infrastructure</p>
<p>jobs that are basically giveaways.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not actually solving problems with climate change.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not pushing technology forward.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not creating these alternatives that we&rsquo;re talking about, they create 10x and 100x</p>
<p>outcomes.</p>
<p>They are yesteryear solutions, and they&rsquo;re not going to move the needle enough.</p>
<p>And so, you know, look, I do think like, it&rsquo;s unfortunate, but the climate change war production</p>
<p>port is needed to kind of get the kind of dollars motivated that are needed to create</p>
<p>the kind of infrastructure to solve these problems.</p>
<p>Despite the free market appetite, the free market appetite, by the way, fuels the outcomes,</p>
<p>but it still needs, it needs something behind it.</p>
<p>Chamath, is it possible, just as we&rsquo;re having this discussion here, we&rsquo;re looking at an</p>
<p>incompetent, corrupt government that is filled with grifters who are bought and sold, and</p>
<p>then on the other side, and causing massive problems.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s a mouthful.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say that people I disagree that people are corrupt and grifters.</p>
<p>I do think that really, yeah, I do think that there&rsquo;s a lot of good motivations.</p>
<p>I just think that the government Yeah, look, there may be corruption, but I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s the the universal truth, right?</p>
<p>People are generally you, you know, you, we&rsquo;ve all met people, which one is it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a point of perspective, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a perspective.</p>
<p>My perspective is that they&rsquo;re all being told by their constituents what they want, and</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re doing it or by lobbyists or by lobbyists.</p>
<p>But listen to at the end of the day, the way that the system is set up is people get</p>
<p>reelected by doing what they&rsquo;re the people that are going to vote and put the dollars</p>
<p>and put the votes out for them are asking them to do.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the way that this has kind of resolved itself.</p>
<p>So, and by the way, when the war when when wars happen, you know, when I guess when a</p>
<p>war happened in the 20th century, that wasn&rsquo;t the driving force, the driving force was existential,</p>
<p>and it was we have to win the war.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the that that really needs to be the mindset we all need to adopt today,</p>
<p>which is an existential mindset, we need to win the war.</p>
<p>And it can&rsquo;t be about what my constituents are telling me what the lobbyists are telling.</p>
<p>So despite this, either incompetence graft, or if you&rsquo;re more charitable,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s a complex problem to solve.</p>
<p>Despite all of that, we have massive entrepreneurship in the country,</p>
<p>we have massive capital allocation at an extreme violent rate.</p>
<p>In fact, a lot of that money is coming from all this money being pumped into the system.</p>
<p>So in a way, do you think the only solution we have, Jamal is entrepreneurs in startups,</p>
<p>who are getting large amounts of money to solve these problems,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not going to happen by government, obviously,</p>
<p>we have a ton of great entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>And I think that we&rsquo;re doing things we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Okay, so this is this is, if you look at the internet, in the 20 years that we&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>grinding in the internet, we&rsquo;ve had an incredible tailwind that helped us, which is all these</p>
<p>people, much like the folks in this room, but in different companies 10 or 20 years earlier than</p>
<p>you are now abstracting parts of the stack, so that the rest of us could use it, right.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I remember 2006, we were racking and stacking servers at Facebook in Santa Clara,</p>
<p>me, Adam D&rsquo;Angelo, like, and I was like, What the fuck are we doing?</p>
<p>And I remember in 2008, what Adam D&rsquo;Angelo, he was our CTO at the time left, he started a company</p>
<p>called Quora. D&rsquo;Angelo was like, I&rsquo;m building on AWS. And I thought he was a fucking idiot.</p>
<p>I thought who builds on AWS, you build your own data centers. Now, if you said that to somebody,</p>
<p>you would be the idiot. Right? So if it&rsquo;s that, or if it&rsquo;s the tooling and the tool chains that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been able to build on top of all of that abstraction and simplification has allowed an</p>
<p>order or frankly, probably even maybe two orders of magnitude of entrepreneurship to come.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also now happening in biotech. So all of that is an incredible progress. The problem now is</p>
<p>we used to be a part of the economy that was an afterthought. We were over here.</p>
<p>Politicians didn&rsquo;t need to understand they didn&rsquo;t need to take the time. Their first reaction is</p>
<p>denial, because it basically pushes up against power. And that really freaks them out. But now</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re at a point where we are so integral, they need to understand it better. Here&rsquo;s a perfect</p>
<p>example. Last week, Illumina&rsquo;s patents expired. So if you&rsquo;re in the business of healthcare, and</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in the business of like, you know, CRISPR gene therapy, any of the stuff that actually a lot</p>
<p>of you guys are involved in, you would love for the fact that, you know, next gen sequencing could</p>
<p>have 1000 flowers, boom, bloom, 90 different methods, the cost of a sequence goes down to a</p>
<p>penny. It&rsquo;s not possible today, because you have to go through one methodology, you have one company</p>
<p>to work through, you have one set of reagents or a set of reagents that one company sells,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s basically cordoned off. That can&rsquo;t change because of technology, because they can then sue</p>
<p>you go to courts and they win. And so this is where you have to interface with the government</p>
<p>and they just need to get smarter. Because otherwise, there&rsquo;s only so much innovation we</p>
<p>can do before their historical legacy things like patents and IP come and bite you in the ass.</p>
<p>Saks, what do you think? Is entrepreneurship alone in capital allocation by aggressive,</p>
<p>you know, thoughtful and bold capital allocators enough to solve the incompetence in Washington</p>
<p>or the graft?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s gonna have to be. And I mean, here&rsquo;s the good news, bad news. Okay, I had a tweet that</p>
<p>kind of went viral. So when Afghanistan happened, you know, we spent $2 trillion,</p>
<p>2500 American casualties, 40,000 wounded. And what have we gotten out of it? The Chinese are</p>
<p>about to take up residence in Bagram, in our splendid Air Force Base. And the Taliban are</p>
<p>one of the best equipped armies in the world. That&rsquo;s basically what our $2 trillion got us.</p>
<p>And China is going to build a superhighway.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>By the way, did you see the thing where like the Taliban were flying around in</p>
<p>our helicopter? It was a helicopter. No, it was fake. Apparently, there was fake news.</p>
<p>Oh, they do have more coverage. Apparently, apparently the helicopters that were left</p>
<p>behind are non functional. So let&rsquo;s just clear that up. That&rsquo;s not true. Yeah,</p>
<p>they more Blackhawks than any other army in the world, except for us.</p>
<p>I mean, haven&rsquo;t you seen all the photos of them? They&rsquo;re all in our uniforms. Incredible. Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. They got our night vision goggles and the whole photos on the internet.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no. There was reporting itemizing the inventory,</p>
<p>the cache of weapons we left behind. It was gigantic.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s get to the question now.</p>
<p>The good news, bad news.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the bad news. That&rsquo;s what $2 trillion of government spending got us.</p>
<p>The good news is I went back and I looked at how much money has been invested in the venture</p>
<p>capital space over that same 20 year period that we&rsquo;re in Afghanistan. And it roughly tallied up</p>
<p>to about $2 trillion. I didn&rsquo;t know that. Actually, I just added up the charts.</p>
<p>Coincidence.</p>
<p>And most of it was in the last five years, because there&rsquo;s actually been a huge acceleration in the</p>
<p>amount of money coming into VC over the last several years, the soft banks, the tigers,</p>
<p>and so that you&rsquo;ve had these-</p>
<p>Late stage funds.</p>
<p>The mega late stage funds. So the truth is, for really way less than, I&rsquo;d say a trillion dollars</p>
<p>of early stage, like true venture money, we&rsquo;ve been able to create the entire technology ecosystem</p>
<p>as we see it today. I mean, not entire, I guess, go back 20 years, there&rsquo;s five years in the late</p>
<p>90s. So the private enterprise system has accomplished so much with relatively so little</p>
<p>money. You compare the efficiency of it, you almost wonder how did we squander so much money</p>
<p>in Afghanistan?</p>
<p>How is it possible?</p>
<p>It took active looting by many different forces to basically squander. I mean, think about like-</p>
<p>It literally had to burn money.</p>
<p>Every venture-backed company at every stage in the last 20 years, that&rsquo;s how much money we spent</p>
<p>in Afghanistan. I mean, how much of that money went to line the pockets of private contractors</p>
<p>and warlords we were paying off? I mean, it was a giant kleptocracy, okay? But the good news is,</p>
<p>look what we got for the same amount of money here, and not just here, every private</p>
<p>venture-backed company. So I do think we are capable of accomplishing great things, but</p>
<p>with relatively small amounts of investment. And thank goodness for that, because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the only thing that&rsquo;s producing anything in our society. But I mean, it&rsquo;s true, right?</p>
<p>But look at what Washington&rsquo;s about to do. They want to stomp on all this innovation. I mean,</p>
<p>they want to jack up the cap gains rate to higher than ordinary income. I mean,</p>
<p>that is the return on investment for venture capital, for the kind of investment I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about. I mean, they want to make it punitive. Now, that&rsquo;s not going to pass, thankfully,</p>
<p>because we got Joe Manchin, but that&rsquo;s about it. By the way, I will contradict myself and agree</p>
<p>with Saks. I do think there will be 100x, 1000x, 10,000x breakthrough that will resolve a lot of</p>
<p>the challenges we face as a species on planet Earth over the century. So we&rsquo;re optimistic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 100% optimistic. Actually, that&rsquo;s the title. You gave it away, the title of my talk in the</p>
<p>morning, tomorrow morning. But yeah, I do. And by the way, my talk says absolutely nothing about</p>
<p>the government. And we&rsquo;ve been railing against the government. Now everyone&rsquo;s kind of feeling</p>
<p>sad. And we sound like a bunch of old guys sitting at the Starbucks talking. Yeah,</p>
<p>talking about the government now they suck. But at the end of the day, I do think that</p>
<p>the ingenuity of the human spirit and science will resolve the problems that we face today.</p>
<p>And we are not going to end up in the government to solve the problem.</p>
<p>All right, I want to talk about one other way we should kind of be</p>
<p>questions from the audience. So if you have a question, I&rsquo;m going to jump out there.</p>
<p>Should we do that now? Because we&rsquo;re just end with the CCP is now moving to break up alley pays</p>
<p>business. This is after Jack Ma went on a holiday to learn how to oil paint thoughts Chamath.</p>
<p>Well, I think this is sort of like one other step in what we&rsquo;ve been talking about for a while,</p>
<p>which is that China is basically becoming a completely vertically integrated government,</p>
<p>where the public and private sector has no real clear delineation. And I think that that actually</p>
<p>has a lot of implications to us because they export an enormous amount of technology and</p>
<p>building blocks to us. And we have no recourse if those guys either change their mind. And this is</p>
<p>sort of what pulls us into this next very complicated phase of geopolitics. Because for</p>
<p>example, if they decide to cut us off, you know, in ours, it, they will invade Taiwan. I&rsquo;ve said</p>
<p>this before, but I think that they will. And we will have no choice except to deploy troops into</p>
<p>Taiwan. Because in the absence of the silicon that we need from TSMC and a couple of other</p>
<p>manufacturers there, we have zero capability here. This is why you see Intel. I mean, for any like</p>
<p>any second, when you guys hear an Intel press release that says they&rsquo;re investing 90 fucking</p>
<p>billion dollars, do you not think where does Intel come up with $90 billion? Right? This is a pull</p>
<p>through from US government, because it allows us to start to rebuild an enormous amount of</p>
<p>critical infrastructure that we&rsquo;ve left to other people. So, you know, China is systematically</p>
<p>decomposing and basically destabilizing all the China internet companies, they&rsquo;re going to control</p>
<p>and inbound all of the critical resources. And we&rsquo;re going to have to have these really hard</p>
<p>conversations unless this is again, why I go back to I don&rsquo;t believe what you said, entrepreneurs</p>
<p>are not enough of the solution, we need the government to step in with intelligence, not</p>
<p>with anything other than that. They don&rsquo;t need laws necessarily, they just need to understand</p>
<p>the problem. And then you get out of the way in some cases, or step in and for example, like,</p>
<p>you know, allow the regulatory regulatory capture to be disrupted, but they won&rsquo;t do it because</p>
<p>special interests. And by the way, special interest, what do they spend? You know, if you</p>
<p>try to donate to a fucking congressman $4,000 $2,500 like these people aren&rsquo;t spending $80</p>
<p>million to defend an $80 billion business, they&rsquo;re spending $80,000. And that&rsquo;s why we can&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>progress. That&rsquo;s crazy to me.</p>
<p>Sacha, that&rsquo;s on China&rsquo;s recent actions to basically deprecate entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a continuation of the trends we&rsquo;ve been talking about on the show, like Jamal was</p>
<p>saying, I mean, they&rsquo;re bringing these entrepreneurs, these their moguls, their their oligarchs under</p>
<p>their thumb under the thumb of the CCP. And Xi Jinping, they&rsquo;re consolidating control and power</p>
<p>and money. And it&rsquo;s also about the data. That was another part of the</p>
<p>this new law is they want to get their hands on the data that</p>
<p>I control all the credit data of every single person that uses Alipay all throughout Southeast</p>
<p>Asia. That&rsquo;s fucking crazy. And they also control everybody. Yeah, we got there the same time.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s crazy. If you were running the Chinese government, wouldn&rsquo;t you do the same?</p>
<p>I would do everything that they&rsquo;re doing, which is why it&rsquo;s crazy to us that we are</p>
<p>sitting here allowing it to be done to us. That&rsquo;s what the crazy the crazy part is not</p>
<p>what there&rsquo;s nothing about what they&rsquo;re doing is not illogical, right? What we are doing</p>
<p>is illogical. Because we should have a reaction to these things. We should have a point of view.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t be tacitly sticking our head in the sand.</p>
<p>All right, who&rsquo;s got a question for one of the besties? Okay, let&rsquo;s try and make it a</p>
<p>tight question. Talk up the book, Jan. Of course, these bills are incredibly wasteful. But you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you guys are engaged. So how come you&rsquo;re not looking through them and saying this piece I</p>
<p>like this piece is messed up? Because it doesn&rsquo;t sound like you&rsquo;ve read them either.</p>
<p>To be honest with you, I haven&rsquo;t read them. I rely on these summaries that I get from my team.</p>
<p>And to be honest with you, the legibility of these things are incredibly low.</p>
<p>And the problem is every bill that gets written now, it&rsquo;s almost like it goes through a process</p>
<p>of you take a two page bullet point bill, which is really what senators or Congress,</p>
<p>Congress people understand and approve. And then outcomes the other end 2000 pages that are</p>
<p>undigestible. So you&rsquo;re absolutely right. I don&rsquo;t I rely on the summaries. I have zero</p>
<p>idea what&rsquo;s really in there. Let&rsquo;s take another question. Yeah, I&rsquo;m Alex Filippenko. You did this</p>
<p>poll of whether the media are right winning, leaning or left leaning and the overwhelming</p>
<p>majority said left leaning. But do you think that that&rsquo;s in part because for four years,</p>
<p>we had been fed so many lies and so much misinformation from the extreme right?</p>
<p>David, that question was directed to you.</p>
<p>I mean, look, I think there were plenty of polls. If you go back like 10 2030 years,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a media organization, there&rsquo;s a guy named Brent Bazell, who was doing studies of media bias.</p>
<p>And if you were to actually look at how people in the media voted, it was 90 plus percent Democrat.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s been, it&rsquo;s been a thing for a long time. And now it came to a head,</p>
<p>I would say, during the Trump administration, because the, the press, I think in going after</p>
<p>Trump, gave up something important, which is, they gave up their objectivity. I mean,</p>
<p>they flatly would, I mean, it was, you know, whether you want to call it Trump&rsquo;s Ranger</p>
<p>Syndrome or whatever. I mean, they now saw it as their duty not to report objectively both sides,</p>
<p>but they would just flatly declare things that Trump were saying were false. You know,</p>
<p>you still see this today. I&rsquo;m not saying that all the things he said were true. Maybe he did say</p>
<p>false things. But normally, if you wanted to say that one person saying something false,</p>
<p>you would get a source on the other side, and then you would quote them. And then that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>you would basically construct the article. And you had the press basically almost really become</p>
<p>unhinged. And I think they they kind of ripped the umpire jersey off their backs, to in order</p>
<p>to chase after Trump. And I think, you know, ultimately, they got him. Trump was a one term</p>
<p>president. But I think that it&rsquo;s really contributed to the polarized media environment we have now</p>
<p>any way to get that referee jersey back on the press? No, no.</p>
<p>sex? Well, how I mean, they, you know,</p>
<p>the problem is the journalism and media have changed so much.</p>
<p>The nature of press has changed. Yeah, right. It&rsquo;s fragmenting and splintering,</p>
<p>much like everything else. There&rsquo;s, you know, we talked about this at some of our companies,</p>
<p>I keep referring to our companies, because I know a lot of people are here today. But you know,</p>
<p>we talked about the fragmentation of food brands, for example, or the fragmentation of people&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of individual media selection. The same is happening in the press, where, you know, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>now kind of going to pick and choose the five articles you want to read as opposed to buying</p>
<p>one of three newspapers and reading everything in that newspaper each day. And I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fueling this, which is not necessarily in my opinion, I&rsquo;ve said this before, not necessarily</p>
<p>a constructed or design decision of the quote, unquote, press, but it&rsquo;s more a phenomenon that</p>
<p>arises from the individuals that consume the media, and they make selections. And that selection bias</p>
<p>ends up driving the clicks and the votes and the counts and the prints of that particular form of</p>
<p>media. And guess what we end up choosing the stuff that triggers us more and makes us feel some</p>
<p>stronger emotion, and then it creates a feedback loop. And that&rsquo;s where this is coming from.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s enabled by the internet, not necessarily bad actors at platform companies,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s inevitable in a decentralized world or a platform to world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re gonna also part of the story is advertising went away as an option as Google</p>
<p>and Facebook took over those markets. So they went subscription and how do you get subscribers,</p>
<p>you pick a side, you can&rsquo;t really go down the middle.</p>
<p>I want to feel something emotional when I click and buy and spend 99 cents or whatever,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s not I just don&rsquo;t want to like be bored to death. Everything is so stimulating in this</p>
<p>digital world. Like I want to be stimulated.</p>
<p>There was a really interesting poll that came out today that speaks to this, which is,</p>
<p>they they asked, you know, people on the left to the right, what do you think the</p>
<p>country&rsquo;s biggest problem is? On the left, the number one answer was Trump supporters.</p>
<p>You know, so, you know, now on the right, it was a little bit more varied. It was the Taliban,</p>
<p>it was China, you know, it was</p>
<p>wrong. What should we be most concerned about objectively from each of you? What do you think?</p>
<p>As Americans, I don&rsquo;t think the right answer for either side is like the other half of America.</p>
<p>I think that happens because you haven&rsquo;t varied your information diet, you&rsquo;re sitting there</p>
<p>watching one station on cable news, and you&rsquo;re being fed, you&rsquo;re being basically being fed</p>
<p>this stuff that the others demonizing the other side, right? And, you know, the other side is,</p>
<p>you know, is being otherized.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s take two more questions. Nico.</p>
<p>Chamath, this goes back to a point that you made about entrepreneurs not being enough and</p>
<p>bringing the government. I think a lot of the topics covered are bringing a lot of government</p>
<p>support or involvement. So from y&rsquo;all&rsquo;s perspective, how do we bring in maybe new</p>
<p>incentives on the government side to bring in younger people, smarter people, people who are</p>
<p>going to make better change than what we may be seeing today? I mean, if you look at country</p>
<p>countries, like Singapore, their solution was to elevate the role of government to be so high.</p>
<p>From a societal value perspective, it was an incredibly respected role. It was well compensated,</p>
<p>and it was a thing that was a real jumping off point to other positions of true influence.</p>
<p>Here, we started with that idea. So like, you know, when you think about what&rsquo;s what played</p>
<p>out in the 1940s, 50s and 60s, I think we had a lot of that. But then the problem was we had</p>
<p>a handful of things that completely perverted the cycle. The cherry on the cake, I think,</p>
<p>was Citizens United that basically just tore the bandaid off. And we are where we are where</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not clear today that the most intellectually curious people are in government,</p>
<p>nor does it even get its fair share. Okay, so what do you do about it?</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s an element of it, which is you have to play the game on the field,</p>
<p>which is folks like us, what I would encourage all of you to do is if you&rsquo;re in a position</p>
<p>to actually accumulate political power, you have a responsibility to do so. And it is directly</p>
<p>correlated with money. And so as you find compound companies, and you get liquidity,</p>
<p>you have a responsibility to be engaged, because you will have a louder voice. I&rsquo;m not saying that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;m not saying that it&rsquo;s fair, but it&rsquo;s the game on the field. The more you spend,</p>
<p>the more time you get with all these folks, and you should use that. Beyond that, we have to find</p>
<p>a way of orienting them. So once you get a seat at the table, I think it&rsquo;s about showing them</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s these nuanced laws that are a lot less sexy than they want to talk about,</p>
<p>but that actually have real impact. Saks, what do you think of senators</p>
<p>getting paid like CEOs? Would that help solve the problem if people could look at and say,</p>
<p>well, I can get paid a half million dollars in that job or a million dollars in that job,</p>
<p>where we draw a different caliber of person? I wouldn&rsquo;t be opposed to that. I wouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>opposed to people in government, the top people making more money. I don&rsquo;t know that though,</p>
<p>that that really would be the thing that attracts a hire. I mean, I think most of those people go</p>
<p>into it for power. And the problem isn&rsquo;t that they&rsquo;re not smart. I mean, some of them, I guess,</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t very smart. Well, you also have the lack of,</p>
<p>since they can&rsquo;t make money when they&rsquo;re in, they have to figure out how to make it on the way out</p>
<p>before. So probably alleviate some of that. Giving them a pay increase is not something</p>
<p>I would be opposed to. I mean, it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s hard for them to do because it&rsquo;s easy to</p>
<p>campaign against politicians who want to pay themselves more. But yeah, I&rsquo;d rather pay them</p>
<p>more salary so they&rsquo;re less beholden to the special interests when they get out of office.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think that by itself is going to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take another question.</p>
<p>So my question is, how do we get both sides to agree, right? We want to get back to the truth.</p>
<p>And in science and economics, we have a way to measure the truth. In science,</p>
<p>you design scientific experiments, and you measure it against reality. So you both sides can agree</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s reality. In economics, you either make money or don&rsquo;t make money, right? You can measure</p>
<p>it against something. So what can we do to get back to both sides agreeing on what is true?</p>
<p>I mean, I think the challenge is it takes more than 15 seconds to walk someone through</p>
<p>the experimental design and the outcome and the action to be taken as a result. Same with any,</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know what the viewership is of the economists, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>going down.</p>
<p>Zero.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But this is why markets work better than politics. Right? This is why markets work</p>
<p>better than politics. Because Freeberg, in order for you to pursue what you want to pursue,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to convince a majority of the country to support it. You just need to find</p>
<p>one person who&rsquo;s willing to fund it. You know, you raise the money. So, and the same is true for</p>
<p>every startup. And that&rsquo;s why progress is made by startups, and not a lot of progress is made</p>
<p>by politics.</p>
<p>This is actually why, by the way, the whole-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t think any of us spend time in politics,</p>
<p>even though we talk about it all the time.</p>
<p>No, but because it influences our decision making. I think politics has done more</p>
<p>to rekindle my interest in all things technology, and specifically Web 3.0 and DeFi</p>
<p>than anything else. Because these last four years have completely convinced me that we need to find</p>
<p>a very decentralized way of building the future.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be ugly, though. I am convinced.</p>
<p>I am convinced that the next 80 years is exactly that. Like, you know, in the physical world,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of stuff that&rsquo;s going to happen. In the social world, it&rsquo;s going to be related to</p>
<p>this DeFi decentralization movement that&rsquo;s underway. And it&rsquo;s underway because of what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re hearing about happening in China, what we&rsquo;re talking about happening in the US.</p>
<p>And, you know, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know. I won&rsquo;t give the context. I was hanging out with some</p>
<p>people the other day. They were working on my house. And they were telling me every single</p>
<p>one of them were trading crypto.</p>
<p>Which house?</p>
<p>Every single one of them were trading crypto. And the whole conversation&hellip;</p>
<p>The really expensive one?</p>
<p>No, the whole conversation&hellip;</p>
<p>Which house is the really expensive one?</p>
<p>The whole conversation was about crypto, and I don&rsquo;t trust the US dollar,</p>
<p>and everything&rsquo;s inflating away. And I think, politically, we&rsquo;re not really awake to the fact</p>
<p>that this is a broad, meaningful social movement. It&rsquo;s playing out with crypto bubbles and NFTs</p>
<p>and other nonsense. But those are short lived bubbles. Those are little feedback loops,</p>
<p>frothiness happening as the tide rises. And I do think that that is going to be kind of</p>
<p>the big pushing force socially.</p>
<p>Which, David, is why China said, no more crypto. What are your thoughts?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the big battle. And by the way, everyone&rsquo;s gonna end up saying that.</p>
<p>Let me come back to crypto. Just one point on movement. So there&rsquo;s political movements,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s kind of economic movements like private initiative. I wrote a blog post</p>
<p>called Your Startup is a Movement, in which I compared being, I said, a good startup founders</p>
<p>and evangelists for their cause. It is almost like leading a political movement. You have to</p>
<p>go out there, kind of have a stump speech, and evangelize people to your cause, which is ideally</p>
<p>a larger mission than just whatever benefits your company. This is why Elon has been able to,</p>
<p>frankly, why he&rsquo;s been able to sell so many cars without spending a dime on marketing is because</p>
<p>he creates a much larger movement than just what&rsquo;s good for Tesla.</p>
<p>But the difference, I think, between sort of a private movement and a political movement</p>
<p>is this, is that when you&rsquo;re successful as the leader of a company, everyone imitates you.</p>
<p>So now, because Elon&rsquo;s successful, everyone else is trying to introduce their own electric cars.</p>
<p>Whereas in politics, whenever you start a political organization,</p>
<p>an equal and opposite organization will spring up to oppose you. And it&rsquo;s just very hard</p>
<p>to get anything done. Maybe that&rsquo;s the way it should be because we don&rsquo;t want people imposing</p>
<p>their political will on us. But this is why I am a big fan of startups and smart young people</p>
<p>pursuing startups and not politics. What do you think about decentralized crypto</p>
<p>finance in America? Should we allow it? Should we tax it? Should we regulate it?</p>
<p>We should clearly allow it because this whole crypto stack, this whole decentralized finance</p>
<p>stack that&rsquo;s being built could very well be the future of finance. And we certainly want to be</p>
<p>ahead of that curve. Maybe there&rsquo;s some bubbles in here in that. But I think what&rsquo;s really interesting,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certainly a lot of really smart engineers, coders, entrepreneurs who are going to that area.</p>
<p>And so I think it&rsquo;d be a mistake just to discount it. I think we want America to be</p>
<p>on the forefront of that technology wave, just like every other technology wave.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make a prediction. My prediction is in the next 20 years, the DeFi movement</p>
<p>will catalyze a movement against the open internet. And it is because state actors will</p>
<p>compete with private actors for this battle between centralized institutional state based</p>
<p>control systems, like I want to have a know your customer if you want to buy crypto in the US,</p>
<p>versus all of these offshore places where I can go and sign up, get a bunch of money and trade</p>
<p>forever and never pay the IRS a cent and live my life in the ether. And the open internet will start</p>
<p>to get threatened. We&rsquo;ve seen this in the past where proxy servers and DNS servers got, you know,</p>
<p>requests from the DOJ and takedown notices. And if that starts to happen, where all the servers and</p>
<p>all the fiber lines that are running in and out of the US and elsewhere, start to get kind of</p>
<p>tackled, like China has a closed internet, you could start to see this become a really ugly</p>
<p>battle that starts to play out. And I think we&rsquo;re not too far. I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if you guys</p>
<p>agree, but I think the open internet is kind of going to be the great battleground to resolve</p>
<p>this. The original battle was over information, and now it&rsquo;s over money.</p>
<p>Well, I think there&rsquo;s a really interesting point there, which is, you know, I remember the late</p>
<p>90s, early 2000s, where the big technology investing wave was all about connecting people</p>
<p>and goods into seamless global networks. And that&rsquo;s where all the investment went today. And</p>
<p>behind that was sort of this utopian idea that the internet was going to break down barriers</p>
<p>and tribalism and remove geographic borders and create a single connected world.</p>
<p>Well, what what exactly is the bet on crypto today, it&rsquo;s a bet that fiat currencies are</p>
<p>going to collapse and deteriorate be undermined by money printing, the US dollar was stopping</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s reserve currency, most likely, that individuals need to be protected against the rise</p>
<p>of the authoritarian state. These are the big themes of crypto. And if you think of major</p>
<p>technology investing waves as essentially a prediction market on what smart people think</p>
<p>the future is going to look like, it&rsquo;s pretty scary that we&rsquo;re going from a utopian technology</p>
<p>investing wave to a very dystopian technology. It destroys capitalism. You know, if you think</p>
<p>about what capitalism is, it&rsquo;s not just a return on investment, but it&rsquo;s the tonnage of dollars.</p>
<p>Right. So anyone who&rsquo;s a big investor here, I&rsquo;ll pick out Jan because he&rsquo;s done an incredible job.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re putting more and more dollars in for more and more dollars out. That&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>pressure, Brad, you know, these guys are under enormous pressure to get tonnage of dollars</p>
<p>through the system in a productive way. And so, you know, these guys are at the forefront.</p>
<p>But when you look at, you know, most of the projects on Solana,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re seated with a few million dollars. And these are 60 $80 billion market cap projects.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t know how capitalism survives in that world, number one. Number two,</p>
<p>governance goes completely out the window, because you&rsquo;re essentially replacing a set of</p>
<p>norms that we&rsquo;ve all agreed to about what a company is. It&rsquo;s an LLC, or it&rsquo;s a C Corp that</p>
<p>is incorporated with laws, there is recourse for you, you can go to these places and sue them.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s a DAO. It&rsquo;s a bunch of rules written in a blockchain. Here&rsquo;s how it all works. Here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how I make my HR decisions. Here&rsquo;s this, here&rsquo;s that, here&rsquo;s the other thing. And then you</p>
<p>basically decompose everything into a service where it&rsquo;s recursive. You cannot build with me,</p>
<p>unless you make yourself buildable to others. Okay. So when you add all these three things</p>
<p>together, I think, to me, it&rsquo;s the most incredibly positively disruptive force I have</p>
<p>seen. I think it will destroy wealth, I frankly couldn&rsquo;t give a fuck. And I think it&rsquo;s better</p>
<p>for the world. Let&rsquo;s take a final question. Thanks, Jason. And maybe to connect some of the</p>
<p>dots. You know, I think the the power of the individual, perhaps reflected in crypto has</p>
<p>never been greater relative to the power of government. Right? Thomas Friedman talked about</p>
<p>super empowered individuals 20 years ago. Whether you&rsquo;re a terrorist, or whether you&rsquo;re a capitalist,</p>
<p>the power of the individual is never been greater. The four of you started a movement earlier this</p>
<p>year, around what was going on in California. Right? A lot of people got excited about the</p>
<p>recall about what might come next. I think where we fail as entrepreneurs, where we fail as</p>
<p>allocators, is we had no strategic plan for California. We have no strategic alternative</p>
<p>plan for America. The parties have platforms. Why don&rsquo;t we put together a strategic plan for</p>
<p>this state, a strategic plan for the country that brings in these folks, the production board</p>
<p>is a strategic plan for winning World War Two. Right? And so to Tomas point that it&rsquo;s incumbent</p>
<p>upon us to get involved. I think it&rsquo;s incumbent upon us to step up what it means to be involved.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not hire a lobbyist in DC. It&rsquo;s not, you know, just show up and vote. But I actually think</p>
<p>that the voice that you have, carries a lot of responsibility. And I think that I would have</p>
<p>liked to have seen the all in step up and do something to catalyze a strategic plan for</p>
<p>California. Right? Not necessarily endorse a candidate, but let a candidate stand on top of</p>
<p>that strategic plan. If we really think about decentralized, right? I&rsquo;ll be really honest with</p>
<p>you. I think that- Tomas, why didn&rsquo;t you run for governor? You&rsquo;re supposed to run for governor.</p>
<p>Yeah, Tomas, you fucked it up. We don&rsquo;t have as four people our act together.</p>
<p>We are still learning because we are like anybody else in a startup. You stumbled into some success.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s about a million people that will listen, watch, consume this a week. And all the polling</p>
<p>or all of the data that you pull, it&rsquo;s like New York, San Francisco, DC. We don&rsquo;t internalize</p>
<p>that and use it for any strategic intent. There&rsquo;s still if I could just to be honest with you,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still infighting, bitching, complaining, you know, all kinds of fucking nonsense where if</p>
<p>you saw the inside of it, you&rsquo;d be like, hey, dipshits, wake the fuck up, get a plan together</p>
<p>and act. We don&rsquo;t have that Brad. And we disagree on a lot. That&rsquo;s okay. But what we but we we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get we can&rsquo;t get away from ourselves. We are learning how to do that. And we&rsquo;ve had a bunch</p>
<p>of instances where we&rsquo;ve had to come together and say, hey, our friendship is the most important.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s fucking sort this out. And we&rsquo;ve always been able to sort it out.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to get pushed to what every other, you know, startup founder story gets pushed to,</p>
<p>which is now what we&rsquo;re just going to sit here babble on for another fucking three,</p>
<p>four years through a pandemic. And, you know, maybe you get to 2 million views,</p>
<p>3 million views, maybe Spotify gives you a deal and you can make 10 20 million bucks a year.</p>
<p>Who the fuck cares? So you&rsquo;re right, we have a responsibility to figure out</p>
<p>if we are for reasonable voices in the sea, and people are attracted to those voices,</p>
<p>what do we use it for? And we&rsquo;ve talked about it, but we haven&rsquo;t put pen to paper and finalized.</p>
<p>By the way, we spend about 90 minutes a week on this podcast. And then yeah,</p>
<p>we each go on to our own lives. And you know, it&rsquo;s never been I also think we&rsquo;ve also tried</p>
<p>to experiment a little bit. David and I collaborated on getting Chesa Boone recalled,</p>
<p>but in different ways, David Sachs, David Sachs, literally helped them start a recall Chesa Boone</p>
<p>campaign. Gary Tan listens to the pod started his own with Democrats. And then I tweeted anybody</p>
<p>want to donate for an investigative journalist to cover Chesa Boone&rsquo;s office because we couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>find anybody covering it. $60,000 showed up for that GoFundMe page. And we just gave it to a</p>
<p>journalist who started this week, and she&rsquo;s reported in the first 10 days on three different,</p>
<p>like tragic cases in San Francisco that have not been followed up on by the DA&rsquo;s office. So that</p>
<p>was just a little, you know, example of dipping our toes and obviously Chamath, you know, being</p>
<p>pushed to run for governor caught fire. Like, we thought that was a joke. It was literally somebody</p>
<p>who listens to the pod put the website up. He tweeted as joke. And then all of a sudden,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s on CNBC. But the best thing has been the feedback we&rsquo;ve gotten from people like you, Brad,</p>
<p>and everybody in the audience, Bill Gurley, a lot of other people here. And we have thought about,</p>
<p>hey, what do we use this platform for in terms of making change like that? And I think that that&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be year two. It&rsquo;s the right question and the right challenge, Brad. It is appreciate it.</p>
<p>I appreciate it. All right, David, we should let everybody get to pizza.</p>
<p>I want to say thanks to the besties to J. Cal, Chamath, Sachs.</p>
<p>Love you, Friedberg. Love you guys. Go ahead, Sachs. Say I love you to Friedberg.</p>
<p>Say it back. Yeah. And just thanks for listening to the show. Thanks to Friedberg. If you want to</p>
<p>make things truly uncomfortable, David loves to give a long embrace, a nice hug. Tell him</p>
<p>this motherfucker. He there&rsquo;s another friend who shall not be named,</p>
<p>who is a side hugger. Nobody likes us. Who likes a side hugger? Anybody? You want to get the full</p>
<p>frontal hug when you have a frontal hug with Sachs, right? Give it to him. But I had to force</p>
<p>him today because he comes into you like, stand up. I&rsquo;ll show you. He comes in like this. And</p>
<p>then he does this. The hip hug. Like he does. He does kind of a hip. That&rsquo;s called Asperger&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Nice to see you. It&rsquo;s called Asperger&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Has anyone noticed that J. Cal looks like he&rsquo;s going to a night at the Roxbury.</p>
<p>Absolutely. He looks like Joker.</p>
<p>I mean, you look horrible.</p>
<p>Thank you. Thank you.</p>
<p>Absolutely fucking horrible.</p>
<p>Okay. Appreciate it.</p>
<p>Is that your MC outfit or what?</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s wrap it up.</p>
<p>All right. Well, this has been the All In Podcast and enjoy your time at the conference.</p>
