    <p>The following is a conversation with Tommaso Poggio.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a professor at MIT and is a director of the Center</p>
<p>for Brains, Minds, and Machines.</p>
<p>Cited over 100,000 times, his work</p>
<p>has had a profound impact on our understanding</p>
<p>of the nature of intelligence in both biological and artificial</p>
<p>neural networks.</p>
<p>He has been an advisor to many highly impactful researchers</p>
<p>and entrepreneurs in AI, including</p>
<p>Demis Hassabis of DeepMind, Amnon Shashua of Mobileye,</p>
<p>and Christoph Koch of the Allen Institute for Brain Science.</p>
<p>This conversation is part of the MIT course</p>
<p>on artificial general intelligence</p>
<p>and the artificial intelligence podcast.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, iTunes,</p>
<p>or simply connect with me on Twitter</p>
<p>at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Tommaso Poggio.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned that in your childhood,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve developed a fascination with physics, especially</p>
<p>the theory of relativity.</p>
<p>And that Einstein was also a childhood hero to you.</p>
<p>What aspect of Einstein&rsquo;s genius, the nature of his genius,</p>
<p>do you think was essential for discovering</p>
<p>the theory of relativity?</p>
<p>You know, Einstein was a hero to me,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure to many people, because he</p>
<p>was able to make, of course, a major, major contribution</p>
<p>to physics with simplifying a bit just a gedanken experiment,</p>
<p>a thought experiment, you know, imagining communication</p>
<p>with lights between a stationary observer</p>
<p>and somebody on a train.</p>
<p>And I thought, you know, the fact</p>
<p>that just with the force of his thought, of his thinking,</p>
<p>of his mind, he could get to something so deep</p>
<p>in terms of physical reality, how time</p>
<p>depend on space and speed, it was something</p>
<p>absolutely fascinating.</p>
<p>It was the power of intelligence,</p>
<p>the power of the mind.</p>
<p>Do you think the ability to imagine,</p>
<p>to visualize as he did, as a lot of great physicists do,</p>
<p>do you think that&rsquo;s in all of us human beings?</p>
<p>Or is there something special to that one particular human</p>
<p>being?</p>
<p>I think, you know, all of us can learn and have, in principle,</p>
<p>similar breakthroughs.</p>
<p>There are lessons to be learned from Einstein.</p>
<p>He was one of five PhD students at ETA,</p>
<p>the Eidgen√∂ssische Technische Hochschule in Zurich,</p>
<p>in physics.</p>
<p>And he was the worst of the five,</p>
<p>the only one who did not get an academic position when</p>
<p>he graduated, when he finished his PhD.</p>
<p>And he went to work, as everybody knows,</p>
<p>for the patent office.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not so much that he worked for the patent office,</p>
<p>but the fact that obviously he was smart,</p>
<p>but he was not a top student, obviously</p>
<p>was the anti conformist.</p>
<p>He was not thinking in the traditional way that probably</p>
<p>his teachers and the other students were doing.</p>
<p>So there is a lot to be said about trying</p>
<p>to do the opposite or something quite different from what</p>
<p>other people are doing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s certainly true for the stock market.</p>
<p>Never buy if everybody&rsquo;s buying.</p>
<p>And also true for science.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve also mentioned, staying</p>
<p>on the theme of physics, that you were excited at a young age</p>
<p>by the mysteries of the universe that physics could uncover.</p>
<p>Such, as I saw mentioned, the possibility of time travel.</p>
<p>So the most out of the box question,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ll get to ask today, do you</p>
<p>think time travel is possible?</p>
<p>Well, it would be nice if it were possible right now.</p>
<p>In science, you never say no.</p>
<p>But your understanding of the nature of time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very likely that it&rsquo;s not possible to travel in time.</p>
<p>We may be able to travel forward in time</p>
<p>if we can, for instance, freeze ourselves or go</p>
<p>on some spacecraft traveling close to the speed of light.</p>
<p>But in terms of actively traveling, for instance,</p>
<p>back in time, I find probably very unlikely.</p>
<p>So do you still hold the underlying dream</p>
<p>of the engineering intelligence that</p>
<p>will build systems that are able to do such huge leaps,</p>
<p>like discovering the kind of mechanism that would be</p>
<p>required to travel through time?</p>
<p>Do you still hold that dream or echoes of it</p>
<p>from your childhood?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think whether there are certain problems that probably</p>
<p>cannot be solved, depending what you believe</p>
<p>about the physical reality, like maybe totally impossible</p>
<p>to create energy from nothing or to travel back in time,</p>
<p>but about making machines that can think as well as we do</p>
<p>or better, or more likely, especially</p>
<p>in the short and midterm, help us think better,</p>
<p>which is, in a sense, is happening already</p>
<p>with the computers we have.</p>
<p>And it will happen more and more.</p>
<p>But that I certainly believe.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t see, in principle, why computers at some point</p>
<p>could not become more intelligent than we are,</p>
<p>although the word intelligence is a tricky one</p>
<p>and one we should discuss.</p>
<p>What I mean with that.</p>
<p>Intelligence, consciousness, words like love,</p>
<p>all these need to be disentangled.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve mentioned also that you believe</p>
<p>the problem of intelligence is the greatest problem</p>
<p>in science, greater than the origin of life</p>
<p>and the origin of the universe.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve also, in the talk I&rsquo;ve listened to,</p>
<p>said that you&rsquo;re open to arguments against you.</p>
<p>So what do you think is the most captivating aspect</p>
<p>of this problem of understanding the nature of intelligence?</p>
<p>Why does it captivate you as it does?</p>
<p>Well, originally, I think one of the motivation</p>
<p>that I had as, I guess, a teenager when I was infatuated</p>
<p>with theory of relativity was really</p>
<p>that I found that there was the problem of time and space</p>
<p>and general relativity.</p>
<p>But there were so many other problems</p>
<p>of the same level of difficulty and importance</p>
<p>that I could, even if I were Einstein,</p>
<p>it was difficult to hope to solve all of them.</p>
<p>So what about solving a problem whose solution allowed</p>
<p>me to solve all the problems?</p>
<p>And this was, what if we could find the key to an intelligence</p>
<p>10 times better or faster than Einstein?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s sort of seeing artificial intelligence</p>
<p>as a tool to expand our capabilities.</p>
<p>But is there just an inherent curiosity in you</p>
<p>in just understanding what it is in here</p>
<p>that makes it all work?</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>So I started saying this was the motivation when</p>
<p>I was a teenager.</p>
<p>But soon after, I think the problem of human intelligence</p>
<p>became a real focus of my science and my research</p>
<p>because I think for me, the most interesting problem</p>
<p>is really asking who we are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s asking not only a question about science,</p>
<p>but even about the very tool we are using to do science, which</p>
<p>is our brain.</p>
<p>How does our brain work?</p>
<p>From where does it come from?</p>
<p>What are its limitations?</p>
<p>Can we make it better?</p>
<p>And that, in many ways, is the ultimate question</p>
<p>that underlies this whole effort of science.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve made significant contributions</p>
<p>in both the science of intelligence</p>
<p>and the engineering of intelligence.</p>
<p>In a hypothetical way, let me ask,</p>
<p>how far do you think we can get in creating intelligence</p>
<p>systems without understanding the biological,</p>
<p>the understanding how the human brain creates intelligence?</p>
<p>Put another way, do you think we can</p>
<p>build a strong AI system without really getting at the core</p>
<p>understanding the functional nature of the brain?</p>
<p>Well, this is a real difficult question.</p>
<p>We did solve problems like flying</p>
<p>without really using too much our knowledge</p>
<p>about how birds fly.</p>
<p>It was important, I guess, to know that you could have</p>
<p>things heavier than air being able to fly, like birds.</p>
<p>But beyond that, probably we did not learn very much, some.</p>
<p>The Brothers Wright did learn a lot of observation</p>
<p>about birds and designing their aircraft.</p>
<p>But you can argue we did not use much of biology</p>
<p>in that particular case.</p>
<p>Now, in the case of intelligence,</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;s a bit of a bet right now.</p>
<p>If you ask, OK, we all agree we&rsquo;ll get at some point,</p>
<p>maybe soon, maybe later, to a machine that</p>
<p>is indistinguishable from my secretary,</p>
<p>say, in terms of what I can ask the machine to do.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll get there.</p>
<p>And now the question is, you can ask people,</p>
<p>do you think we&rsquo;ll get there without any knowledge</p>
<p>about the human brain?</p>
<p>Or that the best way to get there</p>
<p>is to understand better the human brain?</p>
<p>OK, this is, I think, an educated bet</p>
<p>that different people with different backgrounds</p>
<p>will decide in different ways.</p>
<p>The recent history of the progress</p>
<p>in AI in the last, I would say, five years or 10 years</p>
<p>has been that the main breakthroughs,</p>
<p>the main recent breakthroughs, really start from neuroscience.</p>
<p>I can mention reinforcement learning as one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the algorithms at the core of AlphaGo,</p>
<p>which is the system that beat the kind of an official world</p>
<p>champion of Go, Lee Sedol, two, three years ago in Seoul.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>And that started really with the work of Pavlov in 1900,</p>
<p>Marvin Minsky in the 60s, and many other neuroscientists</p>
<p>later on.</p>
<p>And deep learning started, which is at the core, again,</p>
<p>of AlphaGo and systems like autonomous driving</p>
<p>systems for cars, like the systems that Mobileye,</p>
<p>which is a company started by one of my ex postdocs,</p>
<p>Amnon Shashua, did.</p>
<p>So that is at the core of those things.</p>
<p>And deep learning, really, the initial ideas</p>
<p>in terms of the architecture of these layered</p>
<p>hierarchical networks started with work of Torsten Wiesel</p>
<p>and David Hubel at Harvard up the river in the 60s.</p>
<p>So recent history suggests that neuroscience played a big role</p>
<p>in these breakthroughs.</p>
<p>My personal bet is that there is a good chance they continue</p>
<p>to play a big role.</p>
<p>Maybe not in all the future breakthroughs,</p>
<p>but in some of them.</p>
<p>At least in inspiration.</p>
<p>At least in inspiration, absolutely, yes.</p>
<p>So you studied both artificial and biological neural networks.</p>
<p>You said these mechanisms that underlie deep learning</p>
<p>and reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>But there is nevertheless significant differences</p>
<p>between biological and artificial neural networks</p>
<p>as they stand now.</p>
<p>So between the two, what do you find</p>
<p>is the most interesting, mysterious, maybe even</p>
<p>beautiful difference as it currently</p>
<p>stands in our understanding?</p>
<p>I must confess that until recently, I</p>
<p>found that the artificial networks, too simplistic</p>
<p>relative to real neural networks.</p>
<p>But recently, I&rsquo;ve been starting to think that, yes,</p>
<p>there is a very big simplification of what</p>
<p>you find in the brain.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, they are much closer</p>
<p>in terms of the architecture to the brain</p>
<p>than other models that we had, that computer science used</p>
<p>as model of thinking, which were mathematical logics, LISP,</p>
<p>Prologue, and those kind of things.</p>
<p>So in comparison to those, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>much closer to the brain.</p>
<p>You have networks of neurons, which</p>
<p>is what the brain is about.</p>
<p>And the artificial neurons in the models, as I said,</p>
<p>caricature of the biological neurons.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re still neurons, single units communicating</p>
<p>with other units, something that is absent</p>
<p>in the traditional computer type models of mathematics,</p>
<p>reasoning, and so on.</p>
<p>So what aspect would you like to see</p>
<p>in artificial neural networks added over time</p>
<p>as we try to figure out ways to improve them?</p>
<p>So one of the main differences and problems</p>
<p>in terms of deep learning today, and it&rsquo;s not only</p>
<p>deep learning, and the brain, is the need for deep learning</p>
<p>techniques to have a lot of labeled examples.</p>
<p>For instance, for ImageNet, you have</p>
<p>like a training set, which is 1 million images, each one</p>
<p>labeled by some human in terms of which object is there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s clear that in biology, a baby</p>
<p>may be able to see millions of images</p>
<p>in the first years of life, but will not</p>
<p>have millions of labels given to him or her by parents</p>
<p>or caretakers.</p>
<p>So how do you solve that?</p>
<p>I think there is this interesting challenge</p>
<p>that today, deep learning and related techniques</p>
<p>are all about big data, big data meaning</p>
<p>a lot of examples labeled by humans,</p>
<p>whereas in nature, you have this big data</p>
<p>is n going to infinity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best, n meaning labeled data.</p>
<p>But I think the biological world is more n going to 1.</p>
<p>A child can learn from a very small number</p>
<p>of labeled examples.</p>
<p>Like you tell a child, this is a car.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to say, like in ImageNet, this is a car,</p>
<p>this is a car, this is not a car, this is not a car,</p>
<p>1 million times.</p>
<p>And of course, with AlphaGo, or at least the AlphaZero</p>
<p>variants, because the world of Go</p>
<p>is so simplistic that you can actually</p>
<p>learn by yourself through self play,</p>
<p>you can play against each other.</p>
<p>In the real world, the visual system</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve studied extensively is a lot more complicated</p>
<p>than the game of Go.</p>
<p>On the comment about children, which</p>
<p>are fascinatingly good at learning new stuff,</p>
<p>how much of it do you think is hardware,</p>
<p>and how much of it is software?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a good, deep question.</p>
<p>In a sense, it&rsquo;s the old question of nurture and nature,</p>
<p>how much is in the gene, and how much</p>
<p>is in the experience of an individual.</p>
<p>Obviously, it&rsquo;s both that play a role.</p>
<p>And I believe that the way evolution gives,</p>
<p>puts prior information, so to speak, hardwired,</p>
<p>is not really hardwired.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s essentially an hypothesis.</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s going on is that evolution has almost</p>
<p>necessarily, if you believe in Darwin, is very opportunistic.</p>
<p>And think about our DNA and the DNA of Drosophila.</p>
<p>Our DNA does not have many more genes than Drosophila.</p>
<p>The fly.</p>
<p>The fly, the fruit fly.</p>
<p>Now, we know that the fruit fly does not</p>
<p>learn very much during its individual existence.</p>
<p>It looks like one of these machinery</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s really mostly, not 100%, but 95%,</p>
<p>hardcoded by the genes.</p>
<p>But since we don&rsquo;t have many more genes than Drosophila,</p>
<p>evolution could encode in as a general learning machinery,</p>
<p>and then had to give very weak priors.</p>
<p>Like, for instance, let me give a specific example,</p>
<p>which is recent work by a member of our Center for Brains,</p>
<p>Minds, and Machines.</p>
<p>We know because of work of other people in our group</p>
<p>and other groups, that there are cells</p>
<p>in a part of our brain, neurons, that are tuned to faces.</p>
<p>They seem to be involved in face recognition.</p>
<p>Now, this face area seems to be present in young children</p>
<p>and adults.</p>
<p>And one question is, is there from the beginning?</p>
<p>Is hardwired by evolution?</p>
<p>Or somehow it&rsquo;s learned very quickly.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your, by the way, a lot of the questions I&rsquo;m asking,</p>
<p>the answer is we don&rsquo;t really know.</p>
<p>But as a person who has contributed</p>
<p>some profound ideas in these fields,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a good person to guess at some of these.</p>
<p>So of course, there&rsquo;s a caveat before a lot of the stuff</p>
<p>we talk about.</p>
<p>But what is your hunch?</p>
<p>Is the face, the part of the brain</p>
<p>that seems to be concentrated on face recognition,</p>
<p>are you born with that?</p>
<p>Or you just is designed to learn that quickly,</p>
<p>like the face of the mother and so on?</p>
<p>My hunch, my bias was the second one, learned very quickly.</p>
<p>And it turns out that Marge Livingstone at Harvard</p>
<p>has done some amazing experiments in which she raised</p>
<p>baby monkeys, depriving them of faces</p>
<p>during the first weeks of life.</p>
<p>So they see technicians, but the technician have a mask.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And so when they looked at the area</p>
<p>in the brain of these monkeys that were usually</p>
<p>defined faces, they found no face preference.</p>
<p>So my guess is that what evolution does in this case</p>
<p>is there is a plastic area, which</p>
<p>is plastic, which is kind of predetermined</p>
<p>to be imprinted very easily.</p>
<p>But the command from the gene is not a detailed circuitry</p>
<p>for a face template.</p>
<p>Could be, but this will require probably a lot of bits.</p>
<p>You had to specify a lot of connection of a lot of neurons.</p>
<p>Instead, the command from the gene</p>
<p>is something like imprint, memorize what you see most</p>
<p>often in the first two weeks of life,</p>
<p>especially in connection with food and maybe nipples.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Well, source of food.</p>
<p>And so that area is very plastic at first and then solidifies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be interesting if a variant of that experiment</p>
<p>would show a different kind of pattern associated</p>
<p>with food than a face pattern, whether that could stick.</p>
<p>There are indications that during that experiment,</p>
<p>what the monkeys saw quite often were</p>
<p>the blue gloves of the technicians that were giving</p>
<p>to the baby monkeys the milk.</p>
<p>And some of the cells, instead of being face sensitive</p>
<p>in that area, are hand sensitive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Can you talk about what are the different parts of the brain</p>
<p>and, in your view, sort of loosely,</p>
<p>and how do they contribute to intelligence?</p>
<p>Do you see the brain as a bunch of different modules,</p>
<p>and they together come in the human brain</p>
<p>to create intelligence?</p>
<p>Or is it all one mush of the same kind</p>
<p>of fundamental architecture?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s an important question.</p>
<p>And there was a phase in neuroscience back in the 1950</p>
<p>or so in which it was believed for a while</p>
<p>that the brain was equipotential.</p>
<p>This was the term.</p>
<p>You could cut out a piece, and nothing special</p>
<p>happened apart a little bit less performance.</p>
<p>There was a surgeon, Lashley, who</p>
<p>did a lot of experiments of this type with mice and rats</p>
<p>and concluded that every part of the brain</p>
<p>was essentially equivalent to any other one.</p>
<p>It turns out that that&rsquo;s really not true.</p>
<p>There are very specific modules in the brain, as you said.</p>
<p>And people may lose the ability to speak</p>
<p>if you have a stroke in a certain region,</p>
<p>or may lose control of their legs in another region.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re very specific.</p>
<p>The brain is also quite flexible and redundant,</p>
<p>so often it can correct things and take over functions</p>
<p>from one part of the brain to the other.</p>
<p>But really, there are specific modules.</p>
<p>So the answer that we know from this old work, which</p>
<p>was basically based on lesions, either on animals,</p>
<p>or very often there was a mine of very interesting data</p>
<p>coming from the war, from different types of injuries</p>
<p>that soldiers had in the brain.</p>
<p>And more recently, functional MRI,</p>
<p>which allow you to check which part of the brain</p>
<p>are active when you are doing different tasks,</p>
<p>can replace some of this.</p>
<p>You can see that certain parts of the brain are involved,</p>
<p>are active in certain tasks.</p>
<p>Vision, language, yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But sort of taking a step back to that part of the brain</p>
<p>that discovers that specializes in the face</p>
<p>and how that might be learned, what&rsquo;s your intuition behind?</p>
<p>Is it possible that from a physicist perspective,</p>
<p>when you get lower and lower, that it&rsquo;s all the same stuff</p>
<p>and it just, when you&rsquo;re born, it&rsquo;s plastic</p>
<p>and quickly figures out this part is going to be about vision,</p>
<p>this is going to be about language,</p>
<p>this is about common sense reasoning.</p>
<p>Do you have an intuition that that kind of learning</p>
<p>is going on really quickly, or is it really</p>
<p>kind of solidified in hardware?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>So there are parts of the brain like the cerebellum</p>
<p>or the hippocampus that are quite different from each other.</p>
<p>They clearly have different anatomy,</p>
<p>different connectivity.</p>
<p>Then there is the cortex, which is the most developed part</p>
<p>of the brain in humans.</p>
<p>And in the cortex, you have different regions</p>
<p>of the cortex that are responsible for vision,</p>
<p>for audition, for motor control, for language.</p>
<p>Now, one of the big puzzles of this</p>
<p>is that in the cortex is the cortex is the cortex.</p>
<p>Looks like it is the same in terms of hardware,</p>
<p>in terms of type of neurons and connectivity</p>
<p>across these different modalities.</p>
<p>So for the cortex, I think aside these other parts</p>
<p>of the brain like spinal cord, hippocampus,</p>
<p>cerebellum, and so on, for the cortex,</p>
<p>I think your question about hardware and software</p>
<p>and learning and so on, I think is rather open.</p>
<p>And I find it very interesting for Risa</p>
<p>to think about an architecture, computer architecture, that</p>
<p>is good for vision and at the same time is good for language.</p>
<p>Seems to be so different problem areas that you have to solve.</p>
<p>But the underlying mechanism might be the same.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really instructive for artificial neural networks.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve done a lot of great work in vision,</p>
<p>in human vision, computer vision.</p>
<p>And you mentioned the problem of human vision</p>
<p>is really as difficult as the problem of general intelligence.</p>
<p>And maybe that connects to the cortex discussion.</p>
<p>Can you describe the human visual cortex</p>
<p>and how the humans begin to understand the world</p>
<p>through the raw sensory information?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s, for folks who are not familiar,</p>
<p>especially on the computer vision side,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t often actually take a step back except saying</p>
<p>with a sentence or two that one is inspired by the other.</p>
<p>What is it that we know about the human visual cortex?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>We know quite a bit.</p>
<p>At the same time, we don&rsquo;t know a lot.</p>
<p>But the bit we know, in a sense, we know a lot of the details.</p>
<p>And many we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And we know a lot of the top level,</p>
<p>the answer to the top level question.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t know some basic ones,</p>
<p>even in terms of general neuroscience, forgetting vision.</p>
<p>Why do we sleep?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a basic question.</p>
<p>And we really don&rsquo;t have an answer to that.</p>
<p>So taking a step back on that.</p>
<p>So sleep, for example, is fascinating.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s a neuroscience question?</p>
<p>Or if we talk about abstractions, what do you</p>
<p>think is an interesting way to study intelligence</p>
<p>or most effective on the levels of abstraction?</p>
<p>Is it chemical, is it biological,</p>
<p>is it electrophysical, mathematical,</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;ve done a lot of excellent work on that side?</p>
<p>Which psychology, at which level of abstraction do you think?</p>
<p>Well, in terms of levels of abstraction,</p>
<p>I think we need all of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if you ask me, what does it</p>
<p>mean to understand a computer?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s much simpler.</p>
<p>But in a computer, I could say, well,</p>
<p>I understand how to use PowerPoint.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my level of understanding a computer.</p>
<p>It is reasonable.</p>
<p>It gives me some power to produce slides</p>
<p>and beautiful slides.</p>
<p>Now, you can ask somebody else.</p>
<p>He says, well, I know how the transistors work</p>
<p>that are inside the computer.</p>
<p>I can write the equation for transistor and diodes</p>
<p>and circuits, logical circuits.</p>
<p>And I can ask this guy, do you know how to operate PowerPoint?</p>
<p>No idea.</p>
<p>So do you think if we discovered computers walking amongst us</p>
<p>full of these transistors that are also operating</p>
<p>under windows and have PowerPoint,</p>
<p>do you think it&rsquo;s digging in a little bit more?</p>
<p>How useful is it to understand the transistor in order</p>
<p>to be able to understand PowerPoint</p>
<p>and these higher level intelligent processes?</p>
<p>So I think in the case of computers,</p>
<p>because they were made by engineers, by us,</p>
<p>this different level of understanding</p>
<p>are rather separate on purpose.</p>
<p>They are separate modules so that the engineer that</p>
<p>designed the circuit for the chips does not</p>
<p>need to know what is inside PowerPoint.</p>
<p>And somebody can write the software translating</p>
<p>from one to the other.</p>
<p>So in that case, I don&rsquo;t think understanding the transistor</p>
<p>helps you understand PowerPoint, or very little.</p>
<p>If you want to understand the computer, this question,</p>
<p>I would say you have to understand it</p>
<p>at different levels.</p>
<p>If you really want to build one, right?</p>
<p>But for the brain, I think these levels of understanding,</p>
<p>so the algorithms, which kind of computation,</p>
<p>the equivalent of PowerPoint, and the circuits,</p>
<p>the transistors, I think they are much more</p>
<p>intertwined with each other.</p>
<p>There is not a neatly level of the software separate</p>
<p>from the hardware.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why I think in the case of the brain,</p>
<p>the problem is more difficult and more than for computers</p>
<p>requires the interaction, the collaboration</p>
<p>between different types of expertise.</p>
<p>The brain is a big hierarchical mess.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just disentangle levels.</p>
<p>I think you can, but it&rsquo;s much more difficult.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not completely obvious.</p>
<p>And as I said, I think it&rsquo;s one of the, personally,</p>
<p>I think is the greatest problem in science.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s fair that it&rsquo;s difficult.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a difficult one.</p>
<p>That said, you do talk about compositionality</p>
<p>and why it might be useful.</p>
<p>And when you discuss why these neural networks,</p>
<p>in artificial or biological sense, learn anything,</p>
<p>you talk about compositionality.</p>
<p>See, there&rsquo;s a sense that nature can be disentangled.</p>
<p>Or, well, all aspects of our cognition</p>
<p>could be disentangled to some degree.</p>
<p>So why do you think, first of all,</p>
<p>how do you see compositionality?</p>
<p>And why do you think it exists at all in nature?</p>
<p>I spoke about, I use the term compositionality</p>
<p>when we looked at deep neural networks, multilayers,</p>
<p>and trying to understand when and why they are more powerful</p>
<p>than more classical one layer networks,</p>
<p>like linear classifier, kernel machines, so called.</p>
<p>And what we found is that in terms</p>
<p>of approximating or learning or representing</p>
<p>a function, a mapping from an input to an output,</p>
<p>like from an image to the label in the image,</p>
<p>if this function has a particular structure,</p>
<p>then deep networks are much more powerful than shallow networks</p>
<p>to approximate the underlying function.</p>
<p>And the particular structure is a structure of compositionality.</p>
<p>If the function is made up of functions of function,</p>
<p>so that you need to look on when you are interpreting an image,</p>
<p>classifying an image, you don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>to look at all pixels at once.</p>
<p>But you can compute something from small groups of pixels.</p>
<p>And then you can compute something</p>
<p>on the output of this local computation and so on,</p>
<p>which is similar to what you do when you read a sentence.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to read the first and the last letter.</p>
<p>But you can read syllables, combine them in words,</p>
<p>combine the words in sentences.</p>
<p>So this is this kind of structure.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s as part of a discussion</p>
<p>of why deep neural networks may be more</p>
<p>effective than the shallow methods.</p>
<p>And is your sense, for most things</p>
<p>we can use neural networks for, those problems</p>
<p>are going to be compositional in nature, like language,</p>
<p>like vision?</p>
<p>How far can we get in this kind of way?</p>
<p>So here is almost philosophy.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s go there.</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s go there.</p>
<p>So a friend of mine, Max Tegmark, who is a physicist at MIT.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to him on this thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, and he disagrees with you, right?</p>
<p>A little bit.</p>
<p>Yeah, we agree on most.</p>
<p>But the conclusion is a bit different.</p>
<p>His conclusion is that for images, for instance,</p>
<p>the compositional structure of this function</p>
<p>that we have to learn or to solve these problems</p>
<p>comes from physics, comes from the fact</p>
<p>that you have local interactions in physics</p>
<p>between atoms and other atoms, between particle</p>
<p>of matter and other particles, between planets</p>
<p>and other planets, between stars and other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all local.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>But you could push this argument a bit further.</p>
<p>Not this argument, actually.</p>
<p>You could argue that maybe that&rsquo;s part of the truth.</p>
<p>But maybe what happens is kind of the opposite,</p>
<p>is that our brain is wired up as a deep network.</p>
<p>So it can learn, understand, solve</p>
<p>problems that have this compositional structure</p>
<p>and it cannot solve problems that don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>this compositional structure.</p>
<p>So the problems we are accustomed to, we think about,</p>
<p>we test our algorithms on, are this compositional structure</p>
<p>because our brain is made up.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, in a sense, an evolutionary perspective</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve.</p>
<p>So the ones that didn&rsquo;t have, that weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>dealing with the compositional nature of reality died off?</p>
<p>Yes, but also could be maybe the reason</p>
<p>why we have this local connectivity in the brain,</p>
<p>like simple cells in cortex looking</p>
<p>only at the small part of the image, each one of them,</p>
<p>and then other cells looking at the small number</p>
<p>of these simple cells and so on.</p>
<p>The reason for this may be purely</p>
<p>that it was difficult to grow long range connectivity.</p>
<p>So suppose it&rsquo;s for biology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible to grow short range connectivity but not</p>
<p>long range also because there is a limited number of long range</p>
<p>that you can.</p>
<p>And so you have this limitation from the biology.</p>
<p>And this means you build a deep convolutional network.</p>
<p>This would be something like a deep convolutional network.</p>
<p>And this is great for solving certain class of problems.</p>
<p>These are the ones we find easy and important for our life.</p>
<p>And yes, they were enough for us to survive.</p>
<p>And you can start a successful business</p>
<p>on solving those problems with Mobileye.</p>
<p>Driving is a compositional problem.</p>
<p>So on the learning task, we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know much about how the brain learns</p>
<p>in terms of optimization.</p>
<p>So the thing that&rsquo;s stochastic gradient descent</p>
<p>is what artificial neural networks use for the most part</p>
<p>to adjust the parameters in such a way that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>able to deal based on the label data,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s able to solve the problem.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your intuition about why it works at all?</p>
<p>How hard of a problem it is to optimize</p>
<p>a neural network, artificial neural network?</p>
<p>Is there other alternatives?</p>
<p>Just in general, your intuition is</p>
<p>behind this very simplistic algorithm</p>
<p>that seems to do pretty good, surprisingly so.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So I find neuroscience, the architecture of cortex,</p>
<p>is really similar to the architecture of deep networks.</p>
<p>So there is a nice correspondence there</p>
<p>between the biology and this kind</p>
<p>of local connectivity, hierarchical architecture.</p>
<p>The stochastic gradient descent, as you said,</p>
<p>is a very simple technique.</p>
<p>It seems pretty unlikely that biology could do that</p>
<p>from what we know right now about cortex and neurons</p>
<p>and synapses.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a big question open whether there</p>
<p>are other optimization learning algorithms that</p>
<p>can replace stochastic gradient descent.</p>
<p>And my guess is yes, but nobody has found yet a real answer.</p>
<p>I mean, people are trying, still trying,</p>
<p>and there are some interesting ideas.</p>
<p>The fact that stochastic gradient descent</p>
<p>is so successful, this has become clearly not so</p>
<p>mysterious.</p>
<p>And the reason is that it&rsquo;s an interesting fact.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a change, in a sense, in how</p>
<p>people think about statistics.</p>
<p>And this is the following, is that typically when</p>
<p>you had data and you had, say, a model with parameters,</p>
<p>you are trying to fit the model to the data,</p>
<p>to fit the parameter.</p>
<p>Typically, the kind of crowd wisdom type idea</p>
<p>was you should have at least twice the number of data</p>
<p>than the number of parameters.</p>
<p>Maybe 10 times is better.</p>
<p>Now, the way you train neural networks these days</p>
<p>is that they have 10 or 100 times more parameters</p>
<p>than data, exactly the opposite.</p>
<p>And it has been one of the puzzles about neural networks.</p>
<p>How can you get something that really works</p>
<p>when you have so much freedom?</p>
<p>From that little data, it can generalize somehow.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>Do you think the stochastic nature of it</p>
<p>is essential, the randomness?</p>
<p>So I think we have some initial understanding</p>
<p>why this happens.</p>
<p>But one nice side effect of having</p>
<p>this overparameterization, more parameters than data,</p>
<p>is that when you look for the minima of a loss function,</p>
<p>like stochastic gradient descent is doing,</p>
<p>you find I made some calculations based</p>
<p>on some old basic theorem of algebra called the Bezu</p>
<p>theorem that gives you an estimate of the number</p>
<p>of solution of a system of polynomial equation.</p>
<p>Anyway, the bottom line is that there are probably</p>
<p>more minima for a typical deep networks</p>
<p>than atoms in the universe.</p>
<p>Just to say, there are a lot because</p>
<p>of the overparameterization.</p>
<p>A more global minimum, zero minimum, good minimum.</p>
<p>A more global minima.</p>
<p>Yeah, a lot of them.</p>
<p>So you have a lot of solutions.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not so surprising that you can find them</p>
<p>relatively easily.</p>
<p>And this is because of the overparameterization.</p>
<p>The overparameterization sprinkles that entire space</p>
<p>with solutions that are pretty good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not so surprising, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if you have a system of linear equation</p>
<p>and you have more unknowns than equations, then you have,</p>
<p>we know, you have an infinite number of solutions.</p>
<p>And the question is to pick one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another story.</p>
<p>But you have an infinite number of solutions.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of value of your unknowns</p>
<p>that satisfy the equations.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s possible that there&rsquo;s a lot of those solutions that</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t very good.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s surprising is that they&rsquo;re pretty good.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>Why can you pick one that generalizes well?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a separate question with separate answers.</p>
<p>One theorem that people like to talk about that kind of</p>
<p>inspires imagination of the power of neural networks</p>
<p>is the universality, universal approximation theorem,</p>
<p>that you can approximate any computable function</p>
<p>with just a finite number of neurons</p>
<p>in a single hidden layer.</p>
<p>Do you find this theorem one surprising?</p>
<p>Do you find it useful, interesting, inspiring?</p>
<p>No, this one, I never found it very surprising.</p>
<p>It was known since the 80s, since I entered the field,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s basically the same as Weierstrass theorem, which</p>
<p>says that I can approximate any continuous function</p>
<p>with a polynomial of sufficiently,</p>
<p>with a sufficient number of terms, monomials.</p>
<p>So basically the same.</p>
<p>And the proofs are very similar.</p>
<p>So your intuition was there was never</p>
<p>any doubt that neural networks in theory</p>
<p>could be very strong approximators.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>The question, the interesting question,</p>
<p>is that if this theorem says you can approximate, fine.</p>
<p>But when you ask how many neurons, for instance,</p>
<p>or in the case of polynomial, how many monomials,</p>
<p>I need to get a good approximation.</p>
<p>Then it turns out that that depends</p>
<p>on the dimensionality of your function,</p>
<p>how many variables you have.</p>
<p>But it depends on the dimensionality</p>
<p>of your function in a bad way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, for instance, suppose you want</p>
<p>an error which is no worse than 10% in your approximation.</p>
<p>You come up with a network that approximate your function</p>
<p>within 10%.</p>
<p>Then it turns out that the number of units you need</p>
<p>are in the order of 10 to the dimensionality, d,</p>
<p>how many variables.</p>
<p>So if you have two variables, these two words,</p>
<p>you have 100 units and OK.</p>
<p>But if you have, say, 200 by 200 pixel images,</p>
<p>now this is 40,000, whatever.</p>
<p>We again go to the size of the universe pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Exactly, 10 to the 40,000 or something.</p>
<p>And so this is called the curse of dimensionality,</p>
<p>not quite appropriately.</p>
<p>And the hope is with the extra layers,</p>
<p>you can remove the curse.</p>
<p>What we proved is that if you have deep layers,</p>
<p>hierarchical architecture with the local connectivity</p>
<p>of the type of convolutional deep learning,</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re dealing with a function that</p>
<p>has this kind of hierarchical architecture,</p>
<p>then you avoid completely the curse.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve spoken a lot about supervised deep learning.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts, hopes, views</p>
<p>on the challenges of unsupervised learning</p>
<p>with GANs, with Generative Adversarial Networks?</p>
<p>Do you see those as distinct?</p>
<p>The power of GANs, do you see those</p>
<p>as distinct from supervised methods in neural networks,</p>
<p>or are they really all in the same representation ballpark?</p>
<p>GANs is one way to get estimation of probability</p>
<p>densities, which is a somewhat new way that people have not</p>
<p>done before.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether this will really play an important role</p>
<p>in intelligence.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m less enthusiastic about it than many people in the field.</p>
<p>I have the feeling that many people in the field</p>
<p>are really impressed by the ability</p>
<p>of producing realistic looking images in this generative way.</p>
<p>Which describes the popularity of the methods.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying that while that&rsquo;s exciting and cool</p>
<p>to look at, it may not be the tool that&rsquo;s useful for it.</p>
<p>So you describe it kind of beautifully.</p>
<p>Current supervised methods go n to infinity</p>
<p>in terms of number of labeled points.</p>
<p>And we really have to figure out how to go to n to 1.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re thinking GANs might help,</p>
<p>but they might not be the right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think for that problem, which I really think</p>
<p>is important, I think they may help.</p>
<p>They certainly have applications,</p>
<p>for instance, in computer graphics.</p>
<p>And I did work long ago, which was</p>
<p>a little bit similar in terms of saying, OK, I have a network.</p>
<p>And I present images.</p>
<p>And I can input its images.</p>
<p>And output is, for instance, the pose of the image.</p>
<p>A face, how much is smiling, is rotated 45 degrees or not.</p>
<p>What about having a network that I train with the same data</p>
<p>set, but now I invert input and output.</p>
<p>Now the input is the pose or the expression, a number,</p>
<p>set of numbers.</p>
<p>And the output is the image.</p>
<p>And I train it.</p>
<p>And we did pretty good, interesting results</p>
<p>in terms of producing very realistic looking images.</p>
<p>It was a less sophisticated mechanism.</p>
<p>But the output was pretty less than GANs.</p>
<p>But the output was pretty much of the same quality.</p>
<p>So I think for a computer graphics type application,</p>
<p>yeah, definitely GANs can be quite useful.</p>
<p>And not only for that, but for helping,</p>
<p>for instance, on this problem of unsupervised example</p>
<p>of reducing the number of labeled examples.</p>
<p>I think people, it&rsquo;s like they think they can get out</p>
<p>more than they put in.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no free lunch, as you said.</p>
<p>What do you think, what&rsquo;s your intuition?</p>
<p>How can we slow the growth of N to infinity in supervised,</p>
<p>N to infinity in supervised learning?</p>
<p>So for example, Mobileye has very successfully,</p>
<p>I mean, essentially annotated large amounts of data</p>
<p>to be able to drive a car.</p>
<p>Now one thought is, so we&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to teach machines, school of AI.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re trying to, so how can we become better teachers,</p>
<p>maybe?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one way.</p>
<p>No, I like that.</p>
<p>Because again, one caricature of the history of computer</p>
<p>science, you could say, begins with programmers, expensive.</p>
<p>Continuous labelers, cheap.</p>
<p>And the future will be schools, like we have for kids.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Currently, the labeling methods were not</p>
<p>selective about which examples we teach networks with.</p>
<p>So I think the focus of making networks that learn much faster</p>
<p>is often on the architecture side.</p>
<p>But how can we pick better examples with which to learn?</p>
<p>Do you have intuitions about that?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s part of the problem.</p>
<p>But the other one is, if we look at biology,</p>
<p>a reasonable assumption, I think,</p>
<p>is in the same spirit that I said,</p>
<p>evolution is opportunistic and has weak priors.</p>
<p>The way I think the intelligence of a child,</p>
<p>the baby may develop is by bootstrapping weak priors</p>
<p>from evolution.</p>
<p>For instance, you can assume that you</p>
<p>have in most organisms, including human babies,</p>
<p>built in some basic machinery to detect motion</p>
<p>and relative motion.</p>
<p>And in fact, we know all insects from fruit flies</p>
<p>to other animals, they have this,</p>
<p>even in the retinas, in the very peripheral part.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very conserved across species, something</p>
<p>that evolution discovered early.</p>
<p>It may be the reason why babies tend</p>
<p>to look in the first few days to moving objects</p>
<p>and not to not moving objects.</p>
<p>Now, moving objects means, OK, they&rsquo;re attracted by motion.</p>
<p>But motion also means that motion</p>
<p>gives automatic segmentation from the background.</p>
<p>So because of motion boundaries, either the object</p>
<p>is moving or the eye of the baby is tracking the moving object</p>
<p>and the background is moving, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, so just purely on the visual characteristics</p>
<p>of the scene, that seems to be the most useful.</p>
<p>Right, so it&rsquo;s like looking at an object without background.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ideal for learning the object.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it&rsquo;s really difficult because you</p>
<p>have so much stuff.</p>
<p>So suppose you do this at the beginning, first weeks.</p>
<p>Then after that, you can recognize object.</p>
<p>Now they are imprinted, the number one,</p>
<p>even in the background, even without motion.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, by the way, I just want</p>
<p>to ask on the object recognition problem.</p>
<p>So there is this being responsive to movement</p>
<p>and doing edge detection, essentially.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the gap between being effective at visually</p>
<p>recognizing stuff, detecting where it is,</p>
<p>and understanding the scene?</p>
<p>Is this a huge gap in many layers, or is it close?</p>
<p>No, I think that&rsquo;s a huge gap.</p>
<p>I think present algorithm with all the success that we have</p>
<p>and the fact that there are a lot of very useful,</p>
<p>I think we are in a golden age for applications</p>
<p>of low level vision and low level speech recognition</p>
<p>and so on, Alexa and so on.</p>
<p>There are many more things of similar level</p>
<p>to be done, including medical diagnosis and so on.</p>
<p>But we are far from what we call understanding</p>
<p>of a scene, of language, of actions, of people.</p>
<p>That is, despite the claims, that&rsquo;s, I think, very far.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a little bit off.</p>
<p>So in popular culture and among many researchers,</p>
<p>some of which I&rsquo;ve spoken with, the Stuart Russell</p>
<p>and Elon Musk, in and out of the AI field,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a concern about the existential threat of AI.</p>
<p>And how do you think about this concern?</p>
<p>And is it valuable to think about large scale, long term,</p>
<p>unintended consequences of intelligent systems</p>
<p>we try to build?</p>
<p>I always think it&rsquo;s better to worry first, early,</p>
<p>rather than late.</p>
<p>So worry is good.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not against worrying at all.</p>
<p>Personally, I think that it will take a long time</p>
<p>before there is real reason to be worried.</p>
<p>But as I said, I think it&rsquo;s good to put in place</p>
<p>and think about possible safety against.</p>
<p>What I find a bit misleading are things</p>
<p>like that have been said by people I know, like Elon Musk,</p>
<p>and what is Bostrom in particular,</p>
<p>and what is his first name?</p>
<p>Nick Bostrom.</p>
<p>Nick Bostrom, right.</p>
<p>And a couple of other people that, for instance, AI</p>
<p>is more dangerous than nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s really wrong.</p>
<p>That can be misleading.</p>
<p>Because in terms of priority, we should still</p>
<p>be more worried about nuclear weapons</p>
<p>and what people are doing about it and so on than AI.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve spoken about Demis Hassabis</p>
<p>and yourself saying that you think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be about 100 years out before we</p>
<p>have a general intelligence system that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>on par with a human being.</p>
<p>Do you have any updates for those predictions?</p>
<p>Well, I think he said.</p>
<p>He said 20, I think.</p>
<p>He said 20, right.</p>
<p>This was a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>I have not asked him again.</p>
<p>So should I have?</p>
<p>Your own prediction, what&rsquo;s your prediction</p>
<p>about when you&rsquo;ll be truly surprised?</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the confidence interval on that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so difficult to predict the future and even</p>
<p>the present sometimes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty hard to predict.</p>
<p>But I would be, as I said, this is completely,</p>
<p>I would be more like Rod Brooks.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s about 200 years.</p>
<p>200 years.</p>
<p>When we have this kind of AGI system,</p>
<p>artificial general intelligence system,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sitting in a room with her, him, it.</p>
<p>Do you think the underlying design of such a system</p>
<p>is something we&rsquo;ll be able to understand?</p>
<p>It will be simple?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;ll be explainable,</p>
<p>understandable by us?</p>
<p>Your intuition, again, we&rsquo;re in the realm of philosophy</p>
<p>a little bit.</p>
<p>Well, probably no.</p>
<p>But again, it depends what you really</p>
<p>mean for understanding.</p>
<p>So I think we don&rsquo;t understand how deep networks work.</p>
<p>I think we are beginning to have a theory now.</p>
<p>But in the case of deep networks,</p>
<p>or even in the case of the simpler kernel machines</p>
<p>or linear classifier, we really don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>the individual units or so.</p>
<p>But we understand what the computation and the limitations</p>
<p>and the properties of it are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s similar to many things.</p>
<p>What does it mean to understand how a fusion bomb works?</p>
<p>How many of us understand the basic principle?</p>
<p>And some of us may understand deeper details.</p>
<p>In that sense, understanding is, as a community,</p>
<p>as a civilization, can we build another copy of it?</p>
<p>And in that sense, do you think there</p>
<p>will need to be some evolutionary component where</p>
<p>it runs away from our understanding?</p>
<p>Or do you think it could be engineered from the ground up,</p>
<p>the same way you go from the transistor to PowerPoint?</p>
<p>So many years ago, this was actually 40, 41 years ago,</p>
<p>I wrote a paper with David Marr, who</p>
<p>was one of the founding fathers of computer vision,</p>
<p>computational vision.</p>
<p>I wrote a paper about levels of understanding,</p>
<p>which is related to the question we discussed earlier</p>
<p>about understanding PowerPoint, understanding transistors,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>And in that kind of framework, we</p>
<p>had the level of the hardware and the top level</p>
<p>of the algorithms.</p>
<p>We did not have learning.</p>
<p>Recently, I updated adding levels.</p>
<p>And one level I added to those three was learning.</p>
<p>And you can imagine, you could have a good understanding</p>
<p>of how you construct a learning machine, like we do.</p>
<p>But being unable to describe in detail what the learning</p>
<p>machines will discover, right?</p>
<p>Now, that would be still a powerful understanding,</p>
<p>if I can build a learning machine,</p>
<p>even if I don&rsquo;t understand in detail every time it</p>
<p>learns something.</p>
<p>Just like our children, if they start</p>
<p>listening to a certain type of music,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, Miley Cyrus or something,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t understand why they came</p>
<p>to that particular preference.</p>
<p>But you understand the learning process.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>So on learning for systems to be part of our world,</p>
<p>it has a certain, one of the challenging things</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve spoken about is learning ethics, learning</p>
<p>morals.</p>
<p>And how hard do you think is the problem of, first of all,</p>
<p>humans understanding our ethics?</p>
<p>What is the origin on the neural on the low level of ethics?</p>
<p>What is it at the higher level?</p>
<p>Is it something that&rsquo;s learnable from machines</p>
<p>in your intuition?</p>
<p>I think, yeah, ethics is learnable, very likely.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s one of these problems where</p>
<p>I think understanding the neuroscience of ethics,</p>
<p>people discuss there is an ethics of neuroscience.</p>
<p>Yeah, yes.</p>
<p>How a neuroscientist should or should not behave.</p>
<p>Can you think of a neurosurgeon and the ethics</p>
<p>rule he has to be or he, she has to be.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m more interested on the neuroscience of ethics.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re blowing my mind right now.</p>
<p>The neuroscience of ethics is very meta.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think that would be important to understand also</p>
<p>for being able to design machines that</p>
<p>are ethical machines in our sense of ethics.</p>
<p>And you think there is something in neuroscience,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s patterns, tools in neuroscience</p>
<p>that could help us shed some light on ethics?</p>
<p>Or is it mostly on the psychologists of sociology</p>
<p>in which higher level?</p>
<p>No, there is psychology.</p>
<p>But there is also, in the meantime,</p>
<p>there is evidence, fMRI, of specific areas of the brain</p>
<p>that are involved in certain ethical judgment.</p>
<p>And not only this, you can stimulate those area</p>
<p>with magnetic fields and change the ethical decisions.</p>
<p>Yeah, wow.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s work by a colleague of mine, Rebecca Sachs.</p>
<p>And there is other researchers doing similar work.</p>
<p>And I think this is the beginning.</p>
<p>But ideally, at some point, we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have an understanding of how this works.</p>
<p>And why it evolved, right?</p>
<p>The big why question.</p>
<p>Yeah, it must have some purpose.</p>
<p>Yeah, obviously it has some social purposes, probably.</p>
<p>If neuroscience holds the key to at least illuminate</p>
<p>some aspect of ethics, that means</p>
<p>it could be a learnable problem.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And as we&rsquo;re getting into harder and harder questions,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go to the hard problem of consciousness.</p>
<p>Is this an important problem for us</p>
<p>to think about and solve on the engineering of intelligence</p>
<p>side of your work, of our dream?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear.</p>
<p>So again, this is a deep problem,</p>
<p>partly because it&rsquo;s very difficult to define</p>
<p>consciousness.</p>
<p>And there is a debate among neuroscientists</p>
<p>about whether consciousness and philosophers, of course,</p>
<p>whether consciousness is something that requires</p>
<p>flesh and blood, so to speak.</p>
<p>Or could be that we could have silicon devices that</p>
<p>are conscious, or up to statement</p>
<p>like everything has some degree of consciousness</p>
<p>and some more than others.</p>
<p>This is like Giulio Tonioni and phi.</p>
<p>We just recently talked to Christoph Koch.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>Christoph was my first graduate student.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s important to illuminate</p>
<p>aspects of consciousness in order</p>
<p>to engineer intelligence systems?</p>
<p>Do you think an intelligent system would ultimately</p>
<p>have consciousness?</p>
<p>Are they interlinked?</p>
<p>Most of the people working in artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>I think, would answer, we don&rsquo;t strictly</p>
<p>need consciousness to have an intelligent system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of the easier question,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a very engineering answer to the question.</p>
<p>Pass the Turing test, we don&rsquo;t need consciousness.</p>
<p>But if you were to go, do you think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible that we need to have</p>
<p>that kind of self awareness?</p>
<p>We may, yes.</p>
<p>So for instance, I personally think</p>
<p>that when test a machine or a person in a Turing test,</p>
<p>in an extended Turing test, I think</p>
<p>consciousness is part of what we require in that test,</p>
<p>implicitly, to say that this is intelligent.</p>
<p>Christoph disagrees.</p>
<p>Yes, he does.</p>
<p>Despite many other romantic notions he holds,</p>
<p>he disagrees with that one.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>Do you think, as a quick question,</p>
<p>Ernest Becker&rsquo;s fear of death, do you</p>
<p>think mortality and those kinds of things</p>
<p>are important for consciousness and for intelligence?</p>
<p>The finiteness of life, finiteness of existence,</p>
<p>or is that just a side effect of evolution,</p>
<p>evolutionary side effect that&rsquo;s useful for natural selection?</p>
<p>Do you think this kind of thing that this interview is</p>
<p>going to run out of time soon, our life</p>
<p>will run out of time soon, do you</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s needed to make this conversation good and life</p>
<p>good?</p>
<p>I never thought about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very interesting question.</p>
<p>I think Steve Jobs, in his commencement speech</p>
<p>at Stanford, argued that having a finite life</p>
<p>was important for stimulating achievements.</p>
<p>So it was different.</p>
<p>Yeah, live every day like it&rsquo;s your last, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So rationally, I don&rsquo;t think strictly you need mortality</p>
<p>for consciousness.</p>
<p>But who knows?</p>
<p>They seem to go together in our biological system, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned before, and students are associated with,</p>
<p>AlphaGo immobilized the big recent success stories in AI.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s captivated the entire world of what AI can do.</p>
<p>So what do you think will be the next breakthrough?</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s your intuition about the next breakthrough?</p>
<p>Of course, I don&rsquo;t know where the next breakthrough is.</p>
<p>I think that there is a good chance, as I said before,</p>
<p>that the next breakthrough will also</p>
<p>be inspired by neuroscience.</p>
<p>But which one, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, so MIT has this quest for intelligence.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a few moon shots, which in that spirit,</p>
<p>which ones are you excited about?</p>
<p>Which projects kind of?</p>
<p>Well, of course, I&rsquo;m excited about one</p>
<p>of the moon shots, which is our Center for Brains, Minds,</p>
<p>and Machines, which is the one which is fully funded by NSF.</p>
<p>And it is about visual intelligence.</p>
<p>And that one is particularly about understanding.</p>
<p>Visual intelligence, so the visual cortex,</p>
<p>and visual intelligence in the sense</p>
<p>of how we look around ourselves and understand</p>
<p>the world around ourselves, meaning what is going on,</p>
<p>how we could go from here to there without hitting</p>
<p>obstacles, whether there are other agents,</p>
<p>people in the environment.</p>
<p>These are all things that we perceive very quickly.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something actually quite close to being conscious,</p>
<p>not quite.</p>
<p>But there is this interesting experiment</p>
<p>that was run at Google X, which is in a sense</p>
<p>is just a virtual reality experiment,</p>
<p>but in which they had a subject sitting, say,</p>
<p>in a chair with goggles, like Oculus and so on, earphones.</p>
<p>And they were seeing through the eyes of a robot</p>
<p>nearby to cameras, microphones for receiving.</p>
<p>So their sensory system was there.</p>
<p>And the impression of all the subject, very strong,</p>
<p>they could not shake it off, was that they</p>
<p>were where the robot was.</p>
<p>They could look at themselves from the robot</p>
<p>and still feel they were where the robot is.</p>
<p>They were looking at their body.</p>
<p>Theirself had moved.</p>
<p>So some aspect of scene understanding</p>
<p>has to have ability to place yourself,</p>
<p>have a self awareness about your position in the world</p>
<p>and what the world is.</p>
<p>So we may have to solve the hard problem of consciousness</p>
<p>to solve it.</p>
<p>On their way, yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite a moonshine.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve been an advisor to some incredible minds,</p>
<p>including Demis Hassabis, Krzysztof Koch, Amna Shashua,</p>
<p>like you said.</p>
<p>All went on to become seminal figures</p>
<p>in their respective fields.</p>
<p>From your own success as a researcher</p>
<p>and from perspective as a mentor of these researchers,</p>
<p>having guided them in the way of advice,</p>
<p>what does it take to be successful in science</p>
<p>and engineering careers?</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re talking to somebody in their teens,</p>
<p>20s, and 30s, what does that path look like?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s curiosity and having fun.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s important also having</p>
<p>fun with other curious minds.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the people you surround with too,</p>
<p>so fun and curiosity.</p>
<p>Is there, you mentioned Steve Jobs,</p>
<p>is there also an underlying ambition</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s unique that you saw?</p>
<p>Or does it really does boil down</p>
<p>to insatiable curiosity and fun?</p>
<p>Well of course, it&rsquo;s being curious</p>
<p>in an active and ambitious way, yes.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>But I think sometime in science,</p>
<p>there are friends of mine who are like this.</p>
<p>There are some of the scientists</p>
<p>like to work by themselves</p>
<p>and kind of communicate only when they complete their work</p>
<p>or discover something.</p>
<p>I think I always found the actual process</p>
<p>of discovering something is more fun</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s together with other intelligent</p>
<p>and curious and fun people.</p>
<p>So if you see the fun in that process,</p>
<p>the side effect of that process</p>
<p>will be that you&rsquo;ll actually end up</p>
<p>discovering some interesting things.</p>
<p>So as you&rsquo;ve led many incredible efforts here,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the secret to being a good advisor,</p>
<p>mentor, leader in a research setting?</p>
<p>Is it a similar spirit?</p>
<p>Or yeah, what advice could you give</p>
<p>to people, young faculty and so on?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s partly repeating what I said</p>
<p>about an environment that should be friendly</p>
<p>and fun and ambitious.</p>
<p>And I think I learned a lot</p>
<p>from some of my advisors and friends</p>
<p>and some who are physicists.</p>
<p>And there was, for instance,</p>
<p>this behavior that was encouraged</p>
<p>of when somebody comes with a new idea in the group,</p>
<p>you are, unless it&rsquo;s really stupid,</p>
<p>but you are always enthusiastic.</p>
<p>And then, and you&rsquo;re enthusiastic for a few minutes,</p>
<p>for a few hours.</p>
<p>Then you start asking critically a few questions,</p>
<p>testing this.</p>
<p>But this is a process that is,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very good.</p>
<p>You have to be enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Sometimes people are very critical from the beginning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes, you have to give it a chance</p>
<p>for that seed to grow.</p>
<p>That said, with some of your ideas,</p>
<p>which are quite revolutionary,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a witness, especially in the human vision side</p>
<p>and neuroscience side,</p>
<p>there could be some pretty heated arguments.</p>
<p>Do you enjoy these?</p>
<p>Is that a part of science and academic pursuits</p>
<p>that you enjoy?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is that something that happens in your group as well?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>I also spent some time in Germany.</p>
<p>Again, there is this tradition</p>
<p>in which people are more forthright,</p>
<p>less kind than here.</p>
<p>So in the U.S., when you write a bad letter,</p>
<p>you still say, this guy&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, here in America, it&rsquo;s degrees of nice.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all just degrees of nice, yeah.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>So as long as this does not become personal,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really like a football game</p>
<p>with these rules, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>So if you somehow found yourself in a position</p>
<p>to ask one question of an oracle,</p>
<p>like a genie, maybe a god,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re guaranteed to get a clear answer,</p>
<p>what kind of question would you ask?</p>
<p>What would be the question you would ask?</p>
<p>In the spirit of our discussion,</p>
<p>it could be, how could I become 10 times more intelligent?</p>
<p>And so, but see, you only get a clear short answer.</p>
<p>So do you think there&rsquo;s a clear short answer to that?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the answer you&rsquo;ll get.</p>
<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;ve mentioned Flowers of Algernon.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>As a story that inspires you in your childhood,</p>
<p>as this story of a mouse,</p>
<p>human achieving genius level intelligence,</p>
<p>and then understanding what was happening</p>
<p>while slowly becoming not intelligent again,</p>
<p>and this tragedy of gaining intelligence</p>
<p>and losing intelligence,</p>
<p>do you think in that spirit, in that story,</p>
<p>do you think intelligence is a gift or a curse</p>
<p>from the perspective of happiness and meaning of life?</p>
<p>You try to create an intelligent system</p>
<p>that understands the universe,</p>
<p>but on an individual level, the meaning of life,</p>
<p>do you think intelligence is a gift?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>As one of the, as one people consider</p>
<p>the smartest people in the world,</p>
<p>in some dimension, at the very least, what do you think?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it may be invariant to intelligence,</p>
<p>that degree of happiness.</p>
<p>It would be nice if it were.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the hope.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You could be smart and happy and clueless and happy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>As always, on the discussion of the meaning of life,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably a good place to end.</p>
<p>Tommaso, thank you so much for talking today.</p>
<p>Thank you, this was great.</p>
