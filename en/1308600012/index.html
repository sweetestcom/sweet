    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>My name is Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>This podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now</p>
<p>showing that vitamin D3 is essential</p>
<p>for various aspects of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs</p>
<p>in the sense that I don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s any one substance or collection of substances</p>
<p>that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re talking all about emotions.</p>
<p>Emotions are central to our entire experience of life.</p>
<p>Whether or not we&rsquo;re happy or sad or depressed or angry</p>
<p>is our life experience.</p>
<p>And yet, I think with all the importance</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve placed on emotions,</p>
<p>very few people actually understand</p>
<p>how emotions arise in our brain and body.</p>
<p>And I mentioned brain and body,</p>
<p>because as you&rsquo;ll see today,</p>
<p>emotions really capture the brain-body relationship.</p>
<p>We cannot say that emotions arise</p>
<p>just from what happens in our head.</p>
<p>It also involves events, biological events,</p>
<p>chemical events within our body.</p>
<p>The other thing about emotions</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s no real agreement</p>
<p>as to what&rsquo;s a good emotion or a bad emotion.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to talk about the biology</p>
<p>of the chemicals and pathways that give rise to emotions.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to equip you with several, if not many, tools</p>
<p>that will allow you to regulate and change</p>
<p>and steer your emotions should you want,</p>
<p>but not using the typical advice.</p>
<p>You know, everyone&rsquo;s probably heard of this thing.</p>
<p>Oh, you know, if you&rsquo;re feeling depressed, just smile.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s impossible to be depressed while smiling.</p>
<p>Look, if that were true,</p>
<p>we wouldn&rsquo;t have any depressed people,</p>
<p>because depressed people don&rsquo;t want to be depressed.</p>
<p>And it is not the case that simply smiling</p>
<p>will reverse depression or sadness.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s simply not the case</p>
<p>that smiling can inhibit sadness.</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p>
<p>However, it is the case that certain things</p>
<p>that are happening in our body</p>
<p>influence how our brain functions</p>
<p>and the chemicals that are released.</p>
<p>And today, we&rsquo;re going to talk a lot</p>
<p>about how the brain and body interact</p>
<p>to create these things called emotions</p>
<p>in the context of food and nutrition.</p>
<p>And the reason we&rsquo;re doing that</p>
<p>is not because I am beating the drum</p>
<p>about particular diet regimens or anything.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m not going to do any of that.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m going to do is I&rsquo;m going to review</p>
<p>some of the most important scientific data</p>
<p>that point to how ingesting certain nutrients,</p>
<p>both macronutrients like proteins, fats, and carbohydrates,</p>
<p>as well as micronutrients,</p>
<p>can impact the chemicals in our brain</p>
<p>that give rise to the feelings of being happy</p>
<p>or sad or sleepy or alert when you want to be sleepy</p>
<p>or sleepy when you want to be alert.</p>
<p>So this is sure to be a broad discussion,</p>
<p>and yet we&rsquo;re going to get very specific</p>
<p>about what emotions are, how they arise in the body,</p>
<p>tools that one can use</p>
<p>in order to better control their emotions,</p>
<p>tools that people can use to, believe it or not,</p>
<p>feel happier or feel calmer.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because in the last 20 years or so,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been an explosion of scientific studies</p>
<p>exploring how the brain and body interact</p>
<p>to support certain neurochemicals</p>
<p>that give us these feelings of being alert and happy</p>
<p>or depressed or certain that our life</p>
<p>is going to be terrible</p>
<p>or certain that our life is going to be great.</p>
<p>So as mysterious as all that might sound</p>
<p>and confusing as all that might sound,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to make it very clear today.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to come away from this conversation</p>
<p>with a lot of tools that you can act on immediately.</p>
<p>And those tools are grounded in scientific data.</p>
<p>We are going to provide links to several of the studies,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to mention several of those studies</p>
<p>as we go along.</p>
<p>But overall, the goal today is for you to understand</p>
<p>how moods and emotions arise</p>
<p>and the different pathways in your brain and body</p>
<p>that allow them to happen</p>
<p>and how you can use those pathways to change those emotions</p>
<p>and the tools that you can rely on in very specific ways</p>
<p>to shift from being, say, slightly depressed</p>
<p>to feeling happier.</p>
<p>There actually are ways to do that,</p>
<p>or from feeling too alert and anxious to feeling calmer.</p>
<p>And these are tools that are distinct</p>
<p>from the tools I&rsquo;ve talked about in previous episodes.</p>
<p>The discussion around emotions has a long and rich history,</p>
<p>going back to Darwin and even long before Darwin.</p>
<p>This is a conversation that philosophers and scientists</p>
<p>have been having for hundreds, if not thousands of years.</p>
<p>The idea that Darwin put forth</p>
<p>and that was really attractive for about the last 100 years</p>
<p>was that emotions are universal</p>
<p>and that some of the facial expressions</p>
<p>around emotion are universal.</p>
<p>And other people have capitalized on that idea.</p>
<p>And to some extent, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that the two most robust examples of that</p>
<p>would be when we see something or we smell something</p>
<p>or we taste something that we like,</p>
<p>there does tend to be a postural leaning in.</p>
<p>We tend to inhale air at that time.</p>
<p>We tend to bring in more</p>
<p>of whatever chemical substance is there.</p>
<p>So we tend to do these mms</p>
<p>and kind of lean in closer to things</p>
<p>that are attractive to us.</p>
<p>And when we see and experience things that we don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s a mild aversion.</p>
<p>We just kind of lean back or look away.</p>
<p>Other times, it&rsquo;s an intense aversion of disgust</p>
<p>and we tend to cringe our face.</p>
<p>We tend to avoid inhaling any of the chemicals.</p>
<p>This probably has roots in ancient biological mechanisms</p>
<p>that are to prevent us from ingesting things</p>
<p>that are bad for us, chemical compounds</p>
<p>and tastes that might be poisonous.</p>
<p>So much of the foundation of any discussion about emotion</p>
<p>has to center around this kind of push-pull</p>
<p>of attraction to things or aversion from things.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s a very basic way of thinking about emotions.</p>
<p>But if you think about it,</p>
<p>it works for a lot of different circumstances.</p>
<p>And in the brain,</p>
<p>everywhere from the deep circuits of the brain</p>
<p>to the more kind of what we call higher order</p>
<p>revolve centers of the brain,</p>
<p>we have this push-pull thing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re either, in a previous episode, I talked about go,</p>
<p>the circuits that allow you to emphasize action</p>
<p>and then no-go circuits,</p>
<p>the circuits in the basal ganglia</p>
<p>that allow you to de-emphasize action and prevent action.</p>
<p>We talked about how that&rsquo;s a push-pull.</p>
<p>So aversion and attraction is a push-pull too.</p>
<p>Delight or happiness or excitement</p>
<p>are attractions to certain things and ideas,</p>
<p>songs, people, places, foods.</p>
<p>Aversion is a leaning out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a disgust.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an avoidance.</p>
<p>And so we can break down the discussion about emotions</p>
<p>into these simpler versions of themselves.</p>
<p>But at the core of that,</p>
<p>of attraction or aversion is an important theme</p>
<p>that you might realize already,</p>
<p>but most people tend to overlook,</p>
<p>which is that there&rsquo;s an action there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re either moving forward</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re moving away from something.</p>
<p>And anytime you&rsquo;re talking about action</p>
<p>in the nervous system,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about motor behaviors.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about literally the contraction of muscles</p>
<p>to move you toward or away from things.</p>
<p>And anytime you&rsquo;re talking about nerve to muscle and action,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about the brain and the body</p>
<p>because the brain can&rsquo;t move itself.</p>
<p>The brain has a body so that the organism can move.</p>
<p>And the body has a brain so that the organism, you,</p>
<p>can move toward or away from things</p>
<p>that you deem to be good or bad for you.</p>
<p>Now, some of these things that we&rsquo;re attracted to</p>
<p>and some of them that we avoid</p>
<p>are what we call innate or hardwired.</p>
<p>You know, when we taste bitter compounds,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about bitter,</p>
<p>like you like a little bit of bitters in your drink</p>
<p>or something like that, but really bitter compounds,</p>
<p>we tend to avoid those</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re associated with poisons.</p>
<p>When we taste things that are sweet or that are savory,</p>
<p>we tend to pursue more of those.</p>
<p>We tend to lean toward those, so to speak.</p>
<p>And we tend to not avoid them.</p>
<p>So there are circuits in the brain for aversion</p>
<p>and for attraction toward things,</p>
<p>and the body is governing a lot of that.</p>
<p>And so immediately in this conversation,</p>
<p>I want to raise an important point,</p>
<p>which is about a nerve pathway</p>
<p>that many, many people have heard of</p>
<p>that gets discussed all the time</p>
<p>and that is one of the most kind of oversold</p>
<p>for the wrong reasons and undersold, unfortunately,</p>
<p>for its real power, which is the vagus nerve.</p>
<p>So the vagus nerve is one, not the only,</p>
<p>but one way in which our brain and body are connected</p>
<p>and regulates our emotional states.</p>
<p>Now, many of you have probably heard</p>
<p>about polyvagal theory.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to talk about this today.</p>
<p>Polyvagal theory was popularized by Stephen Porges.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an interesting theory.</p>
<p>Certain aspects of it, frankly, hold up to the science.</p>
<p>Some of it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to discuss all of that today.</p>
<p>A lot of the vagus and the excitement about the vagus,</p>
<p>V-A-G-U-S, is because it somehow got into the mind</p>
<p>of the public that the vagus is involved</p>
<p>in calming us down.</p>
<p>So what is the vagus nerve?</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;re going to make this really simple.</p>
<p>In particular, for those that are just listening,</p>
<p>you can just imagine this.</p>
<p>For those of you that are watching,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll point to the various areas.</p>
<p>But basically, vagus is the 10th cranial nerve,</p>
<p>which basically means that the neurons,</p>
<p>the control center of each of those neurons in the vagus,</p>
<p>lives just kind of near the neck, right?</p>
<p>And a branch of the vagus goes into the brain.</p>
<p>They send a little wire into the brain.</p>
<p>The other branch goes into the periphery,</p>
<p>but not just the gut.</p>
<p>It goes into the stomach, the intestines, the heart,</p>
<p>the lungs, and the immune system.</p>
<p>So this vagus nerve is incredible</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s taking information from the body,</p>
<p>and it has two directions.</p>
<p>The first is what we call sensory.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sensing things that are happening</p>
<p>in the gut, in the lungs.</p>
<p>Everything, for example, in the lungs,</p>
<p>when our lungs are distended,</p>
<p>the vagus nerve senses that</p>
<p>and sends that information up into the brain.</p>
<p>It also can sense things in the gut,</p>
<p>like how distended or empty your stomach happens to be.</p>
<p>It can sense heart rate.</p>
<p>It can sense your immune system,</p>
<p>whether or not you have bacteria</p>
<p>or things invading you in your body.</p>
<p>So it sends that information up to the brain.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a two-way street,</p>
<p>and sensory information is going up to the brain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all vagus.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like a superhighway.</p>
<p>Sensory information going one way,</p>
<p>and then the other direction is motor control.</p>
<p>So the vagus is not just for sensing things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually for controlling things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a sensory pathway and a motor pathway.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first thing I think everyone should know</p>
<p>about the vagus.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s so important</p>
<p>that I feel like this is as important</p>
<p>as people knowing that walking involves flexors</p>
<p>and extensors.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s important,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s as important as walking, frankly,</p>
<p>because the vagus is the way in which you can govern</p>
<p>the brain-body connection</p>
<p>and in which you can steer various aspects</p>
<p>of your mood and wellbeing.</p>
<p>But most people just don&rsquo;t understand how to use it.</p>
<p>So first you got to understand what it is.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got sensory information</p>
<p>coming from all these different organs of the body</p>
<p>up to the brain.</p>
<p>You got motor information going from the brain</p>
<p>back to the body.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;ve got this superhighway within you.</p>
<p>Now, what actually regulates the vagus?</p>
<p>Oftentimes you&rsquo;ll hear things like,</p>
<p>oh, you know, this particular behavior,</p>
<p>you know, rubbing your face at a particular location</p>
<p>or breathing in a particular way,</p>
<p>or, you know, a warm bath or something</p>
<p>stimulates the vagus.</p>
<p>Well, right now I want everyone to know that,</p>
<p>quote unquote, stimulating the vagus, broadly speaking,</p>
<p>is a terrible way to think about the vagus.</p>
<p>Because did you know what?</p>
<p>If you have a contaminant inside your body,</p>
<p>the vagus senses that and projects that information</p>
<p>to your brain and you start to generate a fever.</p>
<p>You start to try and kill that contaminant in your body.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know that you want to stimulate the vagus</p>
<p>just as like a general theme.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to get specific</p>
<p>about how you can activate particular circuits,</p>
<p>certain pathways from certain organs to the brain</p>
<p>in order to feel better or relieve certain conditions.</p>
<p>But you certainly don&rsquo;t want to just stimulate the vagus.</p>
<p>Now, excitement about the vagus in part</p>
<p>is because of what quite honestly</p>
<p>was a fairly pioneering theory about the vagus,</p>
<p>which is this polyvagal theory.</p>
<p>So polyvagal, the word poly means many,</p>
<p>is cool because it acknowledges</p>
<p>that the vagus has a lot of different branches.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just one thing.</p>
<p>And so I really like that.</p>
<p>I like the naming polyvagal.</p>
<p>The idea that Porras put forward</p>
<p>was that there&rsquo;s a dorsal vagus,</p>
<p>which is kind of runs the back of the spinal cord,</p>
<p>which is involved in alertness and activation</p>
<p>and kind of fight or flight type stuff.</p>
<p>And that there&rsquo;s a ventral pathway.</p>
<p>And that that&rsquo;s involved in more kind of empathic behaviors.</p>
<p>That is not quite in agreement with the modern anatomy,</p>
<p>but he was doing the best with what he had at the time.</p>
<p>So, okay.</p>
<p>The problem I have with the polyvagal theory</p>
<p>is the way that it&rsquo;s discussed.</p>
<p>People often say, oh, you know,</p>
<p>if your dorsal vagus is too active,</p>
<p>then you tend to be someone who&rsquo;s a little too keyed up.</p>
<p>And people who are kind of in a state of freeze</p>
<p>or kind of flaccid and kind of, you know,</p>
<p>just not really active and they&rsquo;re just lethargic.</p>
<p>Well, then that pathway is hypoactive.</p>
<p>It should be more active.</p>
<p>So, there are a lot of theories</p>
<p>about how psychology maps onto the vagus</p>
<p>that as far as I know, don&rsquo;t map to any real physiology.</p>
<p>Now, the other problem with this kind of</p>
<p>the way that the polyvagal theory is discussed,</p>
<p>probably not by the real experts,</p>
<p>but by a lot of people is that people start to diagnose</p>
<p>different psychological and physical manifestations</p>
<p>through the vagus.</p>
<p>They would say things like, oh, you know,</p>
<p>this person is hyperflexible at the joints</p>
<p>and therefore their dorsal vagus isn&rsquo;t active enough</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really kind of gone way outside the lane lines.</p>
<p>So, today we&rsquo;re going to clean up a lot of that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make it really simple</p>
<p>about how the vagus actually works,</p>
<p>at least as we understand it today in 2021.</p>
<p>First of all, as I mentioned, you have sensory information.</p>
<p>The same way that you detect light with your eyes</p>
<p>or you hear sounds with your ears,</p>
<p>you have sensors in your gut</p>
<p>that sense how full or empty your gut is.</p>
<p>It can also sense how acidic your gut is.</p>
<p>It can sense various things within your gut.</p>
<p>Your heart is doing the same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s informing the brain how fast your heart is beating,</p>
<p>how full your lungs are has been communicated,</p>
<p>and then the status of your immune system.</p>
<p>So, the way to think about the vagus</p>
<p>is the same way I would think about the eyes.</p>
<p>The eyes are looking at colors, they&rsquo;re looking at motion,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re looking how bright it is.</p>
<p>And each one of those things, those features,</p>
<p>is telling the brain something different</p>
<p>so the brain can decide when to be awake or asleep,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s looking at somebody</p>
<p>attractive or unattractive.</p>
<p>The vagus nerve is also analyzing many features</p>
<p>within the body and informing the brain</p>
<p>of how to feel about that and what to do.</p>
<p>So, a really good example that I think is an exciting one</p>
<p>is as it relates to sugar.</p>
<p>So, we all know that sweet things generally taste good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not particularly a fan of very sweet things.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;d much rather have, you know,</p>
<p>cheese or pizza or hamburger or steak.</p>
<p>I like savory fatty foods, but I do like sweet foods.</p>
<p>And most people find sweet foods to be attractive.</p>
<p>They want them.</p>
<p>They might or they might not be able to regulate</p>
<p>their behavior around them, but they want them.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really interesting is that for hundreds of years,</p>
<p>people have thought that that&rsquo;s because of the way</p>
<p>that sweet foods taste.</p>
<p>So, that makes sense, right?</p>
<p>You eat something, it tastes sweet.</p>
<p>You want more of it.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that it&rsquo;s much more interesting</p>
<p>than that.</p>
<p>When you eat something sweet, within your stomach,</p>
<p>you have cells, neurons, that sense the presence</p>
<p>of sugary foods independent of their taste</p>
<p>and signal to the brain.</p>
<p>So, those sensors, those neurons send information</p>
<p>up the vagus to your brain,</p>
<p>goes through a series of stations,</p>
<p>and then you release dopamine.</p>
<p>This molecule that makes you want more of whatever it is</p>
<p>that you just ingested.</p>
<p>In fact, this pathway is so powerful</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve done experiments where they completely numb</p>
<p>all the taste and feeling in somebody&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re blindfolded, so they don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re eating.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re eating a food that&rsquo;s either sugary</p>
<p>or not sugary.</p>
<p>And what they find is that even though people can&rsquo;t taste</p>
<p>the sugary food, they crave more of the food</p>
<p>that contains sugar because of the sensors in the gut</p>
<p>that sense sugar.</p>
<p>So, to put this differently,</p>
<p>you actually have sensors within your body</p>
<p>that make you crave sugar independent</p>
<p>of the sweet taste of those things.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>And what it does, and what it tells us,</p>
<p>is that we have circuits in our body</p>
<p>that are driving us towards certain behaviors</p>
<p>and making us feel good, even though we can&rsquo;t perceive them.</p>
<p>Now, for those of you that are really interested</p>
<p>in gut intuition and kind of gut feelings,</p>
<p>this is a gut feeling,</p>
<p>except this is a chemical gut feeling.</p>
<p>This is a particular set of neurons</p>
<p>detecting that something in your body</p>
<p>has a particular feature, in this case,</p>
<p>the presence of sugars, and sending information</p>
<p>to the brain essentially to control your behavior.</p>
<p>And I find this remarkable because what it means</p>
<p>is that what we call attractive isn&rsquo;t always coming</p>
<p>from our thoughts about that,</p>
<p>or our feelings, or even our perception.</p>
<p>We are drawn to particular foods,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re drawn perhaps also to particular people,</p>
<p>places, and other things because of information</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming from our body.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>what one can do with this information.</p>
<p>I know many people are thoughtful</p>
<p>or concerned about sugars these days,</p>
<p>thinking, you know, we all ingest too much sugar.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s sugar snuck into all the things we eat.</p>
<p>And indeed, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I mean, this should completely reframe</p>
<p>the way that we think about</p>
<p>the sort of so-called hidden sugars in foods.</p>
<p>What this means is that even if a food is very savory,</p>
<p>like a piece of pizza, or a piece of bread,</p>
<p>or even like a salad dressing,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s sugar snuck into that and you can&rsquo;t taste it,</p>
<p>you will still crave more of that thing</p>
<p>without knowing that you crave it because it has sugar.</p>
<p>In other words, you might find yourself</p>
<p>wanting certain foods</p>
<p>and not knowing why you want those foods.</p>
<p>So I find this to be a fascinating aspect</p>
<p>of our biology.</p>
<p>And yes, it relates to mood and emotion.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about how that is in a moment.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just back up a bit and ask the question,</p>
<p>why do we eat certain things?</p>
<p>And why do certain foods make us feel good</p>
<p>and other foods actually make us feel anxious?</p>
<p>I think some people may be familiar with this.</p>
<p>Other people might not.</p>
<p>But most people don&rsquo;t realize that as you approach eating,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an anxiety associated with that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an alertness.</p>
<p>Remember in the previous discussions,</p>
<p>or even if you don&rsquo;t and you haven&rsquo;t seen those,</p>
<p>all of your moods and feelings of wellbeing</p>
<p>are anchored on this continuum of alertness versus calmness.</p>
<p>And we hear so often about rest and digest,</p>
<p>that, oh, after we eat, we feel really nice and full,</p>
<p>hopefully comfortably full and not too full.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re relaxing and we feel satiated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s associated with serotonin, this molecule of satiation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all true.</p>
<p>But what most people don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s an area of the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>so deep in the brain,</p>
<p>kind of in the middle deep portion of the brain,</p>
<p>called the lateral hypothalamus.</p>
<p>And the lateral hypothalamus is really interesting</p>
<p>because it controls feeding, but it inhibits feeding it.</p>
<p>It stops us from feeding.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s another area in the brain.</p>
<p>If you want names, I&rsquo;ll give them to you.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want names, just ignore them,</p>
<p>delete them from your memory and awareness,</p>
<p>called the locus coeruleus.</p>
<p>Now the locus coeruleus sits back further in the brainstem</p>
<p>and it releases norepinephrine,</p>
<p>which is essentially adrenaline and makes us feel alert.</p>
<p>Now locus coeruleus has a lot of different functions</p>
<p>in the brain, but when we are going to eat,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say we walk into a restaurant,</p>
<p>we sit down or we&rsquo;re preparing a meal,</p>
<p>locus coeruleus is known to release noradrenaline</p>
<p>in the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s creating a kind of alertness.</p>
<p>This has ancient utility, but it&rsquo;s creating this alertness.</p>
<p>And for many people, they experience that</p>
<p>as they approach food, as stress, as anxiety.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s interesting is that as we approach food,</p>
<p>locus coeruleus is releasing all these molecules</p>
<p>that make us feel more anxious and alert.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s felt as excitement,</p>
<p>and that has probably to do</p>
<p>with how we feel about food generally.</p>
<p>Are we happy with our relationship to food?</p>
<p>Are we trying to restrict our relationship to food?</p>
<p>Are people coming over for dinner?</p>
<p>All that will play in, of course,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a certain stress and anxiety</p>
<p>on approach to food.</p>
<p>And as we approach food and we feel that anxiety,</p>
<p>locus coeruleus activates the lateral hypothalamus</p>
<p>in a way that inhibits feeding,</p>
<p>that makes us not want to eat.</p>
<p>So a lot of people who have kind of pre-meal anxiety</p>
<p>or anxiety around food,</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t seem to just calm down and have a good meal</p>
<p>to access that later rest and digest,</p>
<p>a lot of that is because of this heightened stress</p>
<p>upon approach to food.</p>
<p>And a lot of the tools that are out there,</p>
<p>both for eating disorders</p>
<p>and for just kind of the general public</p>
<p>who isn&rsquo;t suffering from eating disorders,</p>
<p>things like mindfulness around meals.</p>
<p>They always tell you,</p>
<p>you should never eat when stressed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but my life is not organized</p>
<p>in a way that I can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>I would never eat, right?</p>
<p>Because I eat when I&rsquo;m awake,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m stressed,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think I am,</p>
<p>but I tend to run around a lot during the day.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t generally take time</p>
<p>to do two or three deep breaths before I eat.</p>
<p>I generally will just keep, will eat.</p>
<p>That can be healthy or unhealthy</p>
<p>depending on the quality of your digestion.</p>
<p>I think using digestion as a guide is good,</p>
<p>but a lot of people aren&rsquo;t aware</p>
<p>that this interaction between locus coeruleus</p>
<p>and lateral hypothalamus is a basic mechanism</p>
<p>where we are supposed to get a little bit alert</p>
<p>and anxious around mealtime.</p>
<p>And then as we eat,</p>
<p>the mechanisms for calming and satiation</p>
<p>are supposed to kick in.</p>
<p>And those mechanisms involve,</p>
<p>as I mentioned earlier, two things.</p>
<p>One is how things taste.</p>
<p>Digestion starts in the mouth, of course.</p>
<p>We taste our food.</p>
<p>Everyone tells us we should chew our food more.</p>
<p>Yes, that can improve digestion.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not supposed to drink too many fluids as we eat.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true too.</p>
<p>But a lot of how we feel while we eat</p>
<p>and after we eat is because of this vagus sensing</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s in our gut.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sending information all the time.</p>
<p>Is there sugar?</p>
<p>Are there fats?</p>
<p>Are there contaminants?</p>
<p>There are a lot of information,</p>
<p>these so-called parallel pathways</p>
<p>that are going up into our brain</p>
<p>that regulate whether or not</p>
<p>we want to eat more of something or not.</p>
<p>And there are accelerators,</p>
<p>things that make us want to eat more,</p>
<p>like sugar and fats,</p>
<p>because those are nutrient dense</p>
<p>and they helps generally, at least in the short term,</p>
<p>support the survival of animals,</p>
<p>but also amino acids.</p>
<p>And this is very important.</p>
<p>There are a lot of data,</p>
<p>but much of what comes from the data</p>
<p>on what people eat and how much they eat</p>
<p>is from a subconscious detection</p>
<p>of how many amino acids and what the array,</p>
<p>meaning the constellation of amino acids is in a given food.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fair to say that the sum total of these studies</p>
<p>point in a direction where people will basically eat,</p>
<p>not until their stomach is full,</p>
<p>but until the brain perceives</p>
<p>that they have adequate intake of amino acids.</p>
<p>Now, this is a conversation that comes up</p>
<p>in the context of the meat only, the keto,</p>
<p>the kind of zone diet, the Mediterranean diet,</p>
<p>the vegan diet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m largely going to ignore the kind of strict camps today.</p>
<p>I will talk a little bit about it</p>
<p>because I think each one of them</p>
<p>actually taps into something important</p>
<p>about this brain body relationship</p>
<p>that the other ones don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t want to get into a discussion</p>
<p>about the ethics of different foods</p>
<p>of animal-based or non-animal-based</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s not the topic today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really about nutrient sensing and amino acid sensing.</p>
<p>So we generally will eat until our gut tells our brain</p>
<p>that we have adequate amounts of these amino acids.</p>
<p>Amino acids, of course, are important</p>
<p>because they are the building blocks of, sure,</p>
<p>muscle and the other things in our body that need repair.</p>
<p>But what most people don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>is that amino acids are what the neurochemicals</p>
<p>in the brain are made from.</p>
<p>Now, this is vitally important, okay?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve heard dopamine is this molecule</p>
<p>that makes you feel good.</p>
<p>Actually, dopamine is a molecule that makes you feel good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s released within the brain</p>
<p>and it does feel very good when you have dopamine release.</p>
<p>Dopamine release is caused by surprise, excitement,</p>
<p>events that you&rsquo;re looking forward to</p>
<p>and that turn out well.</p>
<p>It is inhibited by events you&rsquo;re looking forward to,</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t work out.</p>
<p>When someone says they&rsquo;re going to call</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re really, really excited to talk to</p>
<p>and then they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Or you thought a movie was going to be really great</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Or you expect a meal to be really delicious</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of eh.</p>
<p>And we actually, there&rsquo;s a name for that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called reward prediction error.</p>
<p>So if, and you can actually use this</p>
<p>in the context of meals and plans</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s very useful with yourself</p>
<p>and people you know.</p>
<p>Essentially, if you expect something to be really terrific,</p>
<p>it really does place a higher expectation</p>
<p>at the chemical level.</p>
<p>So if you don&rsquo;t get as much dopamine</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re expecting from something,</p>
<p>so you hear about a really great restaurant</p>
<p>or a place that has a really,</p>
<p>in my case, I wouldn&rsquo;t call it an addiction.</p>
<p>I would call it more of an affliction for croissants.</p>
<p>The best vegetable, of course, is the croissant.</p>
<p>And I get really excited about the fact</p>
<p>that someone will tell me, oh, there&rsquo;s this place</p>
<p>and they have incredible croissants.</p>
<p>You got to go there.</p>
<p>So I get really excited and I&rsquo;ll go.</p>
<p>And just them telling me</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s going to be really terrific raises an expectation,</p>
<p>a dopamine expectation.</p>
<p>And unless those croissants are amazing,</p>
<p>chances are I&rsquo;m going to experience them as less good,</p>
<p>less satisfying.</p>
<p>I will truly release less dopamine</p>
<p>than I would had they just said,</p>
<p>oh yeah, I think that there are croissants down the street</p>
<p>or if I just tried one at random.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because of this reward prediction error.</p>
<p>Your expectation of something releases dopamine</p>
<p>and the actual event releases dopamine.</p>
<p>And if the event related dopamine</p>
<p>does not exceed the expectation or at least match it,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a much higher tendency</p>
<p>that you won&rsquo;t pursue that thing again.</p>
<p>So dopamine is really powerful</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not just the molecule of reward,</p>
<p>it is the molecule of desire.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the molecule of wanting,</p>
<p>not just the molecule of having.</p>
<p>And a book, since people often ask for book recommendations,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the author personally, but I love the book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called The Molecule of More.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a terrific book.</p>
<p>I wish I had written it, frankly.</p>
<p>But if you want to learn more about dopamine,</p>
<p>reward prediction error,</p>
<p>and how dopamine regulates various aspects</p>
<p>of your emotional and motivational life,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a terrific read.</p>
<p>Dopamine is what&rsquo;s going to lead us</p>
<p>to want to eat more of something</p>
<p>or to not want more of something.</p>
<p>Because dopamine really is about craving.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about motivation and it&rsquo;s about desire.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned, these amino acid sensors in our gut</p>
<p>are detecting how many amino acids,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re also detecting which amino acids.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a particular amino acid called L-tyrosine,</p>
<p>which comes from food.</p>
<p>You can look up online which foods contain L-tyrosine.</p>
<p>It is in meats, it is in nuts,</p>
<p>it is also in some plant-based foods.</p>
<p>L-tyrosine is the precursor to a couple other molecules</p>
<p>like L-DOPA, et cetera, that make dopamine.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a misconception out there</p>
<p>that most of the serotonin is in our gut</p>
<p>and most of the dopamine is in our gut</p>
<p>and therefore our mood is in our gut.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not quite the way it works, okay?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about serotonin in a moment,</p>
<p>but dopamine is synthesized</p>
<p>from the amino acids that you eat.</p>
<p>However, the dopamine neurons that give rise</p>
<p>to these feelings of good or wanting more</p>
<p>or desire and motivation, those reside in the brain.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t want to get too confused.</p>
<p>We want to respect and honor the power of the gut</p>
<p>and this vagal pathway,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really neurons within your brain</p>
<p>that drive the pursuit and decision-making.</p>
<p>So what does this mean?</p>
<p>Well, some people make too little dopamine.</p>
<p>Some people make so little dopamine</p>
<p>that they need prescription dopamine.</p>
<p>They need L-DOPA.</p>
<p>People with Parkinson&rsquo;s take L-DOPA</p>
<p>and other compounds to increase dopamine</p>
<p>because Parkinson&rsquo;s is associated</p>
<p>with deficits in movement.</p>
<p>It starts as a tremor.</p>
<p>Actually starts as some other things that are interesting.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about in a moment,</p>
<p>but Parkinson&rsquo;s is a depression.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a blunting of motivation and mood and affect</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a tremor.</p>
<p>And then eventually in severe conditions,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s challenges in speaking and walking.</p>
<p>So some famous examples would be Muhammad Ali,</p>
<p>Michael J. Fox, the great boxing trainer, Freddie Roach.</p>
<p>These people have Parkinson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and they, at least later in their life,</p>
<p>had challenges speaking.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s not just fighters that develop Parkinson&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>As far as I know, Michael J. Fox wasn&rsquo;t a fighter.</p>
<p>People can develop Parkinson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and Parkinson&rsquo;s is a depletion</p>
<p>of dopamine neurons in the brain.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just movement challenges,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s challenges with mood.</p>
<p>Now, hopefully most of you, all of you,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have Parkinson&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s clear that dietary L-tyrosine</p>
<p>supports the healthy production of things like dopamine</p>
<p>and as well as other factors within the brain.</p>
<p>Now, some people immediately ask,</p>
<p>well, should I supplement L-tyrosine?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just talk about that</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s going to come up.</p>
<p>Full disclosure, I sometimes take L-tyrosine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not taking it right now, but I take it only occasionally.</p>
<p>You can buy this in capsule form.</p>
<p>It does increase kind of mood and elevation and alertness.</p>
<p>It is over the counter.</p>
<p>You have to check with your doctor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not responsible for your healthcare</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not a doctor.</p>
<p>Whether or not it&rsquo;s safe for you.</p>
<p>People with preexisting hyper-dopaminergic conditions</p>
<p>like mania should probably not take L-tyrosine.</p>
<p>The other thing about taking L-tyrosine</p>
<p>is there is a crash, okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a massive crash if you take it at appropriate doses</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s right for you,</p>
<p>but it can produce a crash and a lethargy</p>
<p>and a kind of brain fog after the next day or so.</p>
<p>And so L-tyrosine, however,</p>
<p>can be ingested through foods or through supplementation</p>
<p>to increase dopamine levels.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s well-known.</p>
<p>Taking chronically, however,</p>
<p>it can disrupt those dopamine pathways.</p>
<p>Now, there are other drugs that will increase L-tyrosine</p>
<p>and dopamine as well,</p>
<p>but those are severe enough</p>
<p>that they generally tend to have addictive properties.</p>
<p>So things like methamphetamine,</p>
<p>things like cocaine are terrible</p>
<p>because they really ramp up the dopamine system so much</p>
<p>that people really can&rsquo;t achieve dopamine release</p>
<p>through any other mechanisms.</p>
<p>But food and the ingestion of L-tyrosine</p>
<p>has a profound effect on our levels of dopamine.</p>
<p>It takes a little while,</p>
<p>but that really will impact level of mood.</p>
<p>Certain antidepressants fall into the category</p>
<p>of dopaminergic antidepressants.</p>
<p>One of the most famous ones, of course, is Welbutrin.</p>
<p>Welbutrin was developed</p>
<p>because a lot of the other antidepressants</p>
<p>tend to make people feel kind of lethargic</p>
<p>or they had side effect profiles that people didn&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>So they developed this thing</p>
<p>that the generic name is different,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s generally called Welbutrin.</p>
<p>Welbutrin activates dopamine and epinephrine,</p>
<p>which is a substrate of dopamine,</p>
<p>and both of those are involved in motivation</p>
<p>and alertness and effort.</p>
<p>So you might say, wow, this sounds like a great drug.</p>
<p>However, this drug, the side effect profile</p>
<p>tends to be the things that are associated</p>
<p>with elevated mood and alertness.</p>
<p>So this isn&rsquo;t like taking some L-tyrosine,</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t like eating some tyrosine-rich foods.</p>
<p>This is really a much greater release</p>
<p>of dopamine and epinephrine,</p>
<p>and it increases things like anxiety,</p>
<p>sweating, the pupils dilate.</p>
<p>It has certain effects on,</p>
<p>in particular, people with epilepsy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been used somewhat successfully for smoking cessation,</p>
<p>but again, it&rsquo;s not for everybody,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not here to encourage the use of these things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just describing the biology and the rationale</p>
<p>for why these drugs were developed.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s back up a second.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just kind of take stock of where we&rsquo;re at.</p>
<p>We have a brain-body connection.</p>
<p>There are many of them,</p>
<p>but one of the main ones is the vagus nerve.</p>
<p>The vagus collects information about a lot of things,</p>
<p>breathing, heart rate,</p>
<p>stuff that&rsquo;s happening in the gut, et cetera,</p>
<p>and gut, by the way, includes the stomach and the intestines,</p>
<p>sends that information up to the brain.</p>
<p>The brain is using that information</p>
<p>to decide one of two things,</p>
<p>move toward something or move away.</p>
<p>It can also pause,</p>
<p>but essentially pausing is not moving toward.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the dopamine pathway,</p>
<p>and foods rich in L-tyrosine</p>
<p>generally give us an elevated mood</p>
<p>and make us want to do more of whatever it is</p>
<p>that we happen to be doing, as well as other things.</p>
<p>Motivation generalizes to other things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not unique to just ingesting foods,</p>
<p>but foods that give us a big pulse of dopamine</p>
<p>will make us crave more of that food.</p>
<p>It will make us crave more of the activity</p>
<p>that led to the ingestion of that food.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>a lot of that is happening at a subconscious level</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not even aware of.</p>
<p>And this is why I think the concern about hidden sugars</p>
<p>and over-ingestion of sugars is serious</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not just that the sugars</p>
<p>are impacting our blood glucose in negative ways,</p>
<p>although often it is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just the obesity crisis that&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also the fact that it&rsquo;s disrupting our dopamine systems.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn&rsquo;t mean all sugar is bad.</p>
<p>Some people have a quite healthy relationship to sugar,</p>
<p>but I think most people are just not aware</p>
<p>that sugar isn&rsquo;t just operating at the level of taste,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s operating at the level of neurochemicals</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s doing it subconsciously.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to talk about some of the other pathways</p>
<p>between brain and body</p>
<p>that regulate our moods and emotions,</p>
<p>but also are actionable.</p>
<p>So the other neuromodulator that&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>in the context of the vagus is serotonin.</p>
<p>Serotonin, just to remind you, is a neuromodulator,</p>
<p>therefore it creates a bias in which neural circuits,</p>
<p>which neurons in the brain and body are going to be active,</p>
<p>and it makes it less likely</p>
<p>that other ones are going to be active.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair to say without ever having measured it</p>
<p>that my bulldog Costello must just,</p>
<p>his brain and body must be swimming in serotonin</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s very calm and he eats a lot,</p>
<p>but he generally feels pretty sated.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s kind of an animal that&rsquo;s obsessed with comforts.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a bit of a hedonist.</p>
<p>And serotonin, when it&rsquo;s elevated,</p>
<p>tends to make us feel really comfortable</p>
<p>and kind of blissed out wherever we are.</p>
<p>And that contrast with dopamine and epinephrine,</p>
<p>which mainly put us in pursuit of things,</p>
<p>motivation is pursuit.</p>
<p>Serotonin is more about feeling really comfy where we are.</p>
<p>The conversation around the brain-body relationship</p>
<p>and mood in serotonin for many years was,</p>
<p>well, you eat a big meal, the gut is distended,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got all the nutrients you need,</p>
<p>you rest and digest, and serotonin is released.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of true, but there&rsquo;s a lot more going on</p>
<p>and a lot more that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>and actionable that&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>First of all, some of you, but perhaps not all,</p>
<p>have heard that more than 90% of the serotonin</p>
<p>that we make is in our gut.</p>
<p>And indeed, we have a lot of serotonin in our gut.</p>
<p>We have neurons in our gut that make serotonin.</p>
<p>We have neurons in our brain that make serotonin.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>Most of the serotonin that impacts our mood</p>
<p>and our mental state is not in our gut.</p>
<p>Most of it is in the neurons of the brain</p>
<p>in an area called the raphe nucleus of the brain.</p>
<p>There are a few other locations too.</p>
<p>And those are the neurons that control</p>
<p>whether or not we feel satiated or not,</p>
<p>whether or not we feel happy and calm.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have a discussion about serotonin</p>
<p>without having a discussion about antidepressants</p>
<p>because during the late 80s and early 90s,</p>
<p>there was this explosion in the number of prescription drugs</p>
<p>that were released,</p>
<p>things like first one and most famous one is Prozac,</p>
<p>Zoloft, Paxil, a number of other ones</p>
<p>that are so-called SSRI,</p>
<p>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a long acronym,</p>
<p>but basically those drugs work by preventing</p>
<p>the gobbling up of serotonin</p>
<p>or reuptake of serotonin into neurons</p>
<p>after it&rsquo;s been released,</p>
<p>which leads to more serotonin overall,</p>
<p>which means to elevate serotonin.</p>
<p>And indeed those drugs were and can be very useful</p>
<p>for certain people to feel better in cases of depression</p>
<p>and some other clinical disorders as well.</p>
<p>So I really don&rsquo;t want to dismiss them</p>
<p>as useless or dangerous for everybody.</p>
<p>They can be quite useful for many people.</p>
<p>Not everyone responds well to them,</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve all heard,</p>
<p>and their side effect profile</p>
<p>has effects like blunting affect.</p>
<p>It can make people feel kind of flat, kind of meh.</p>
<p>It can reduce appetite for food.</p>
<p>It can reduce appetite for sex.</p>
<p>It can do all sorts of things,</p>
<p>or it can work really well.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s a dose-related issue, et cetera.</p>
<p>Serotonin is fascinating, however,</p>
<p>because how well those neurons in the raphe work</p>
<p>is impacted by some events within the gut.</p>
<p>Although you might be surprised to find out</p>
<p>what those events are.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go a little bit deeper into the gut.</p>
<p>And again, the gut includes the stomach</p>
<p>and then the small intestine and the large intestine.</p>
<p>And ask like, what is going on with serotonin in the gut?</p>
<p>How is it impacting serotonin in the brain?</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s think about this in the context</p>
<p>of how some of us might want to increase</p>
<p>or decrease our serotonin levels.</p>
<p>So as far as I know,</p>
<p>there aren&rsquo;t any really good at-home blood tests</p>
<p>for things like serotonin and dopamine.</p>
<p>There are some commercial products out there,</p>
<p>but to me, just to me, I&rsquo;m not particularly impressed.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s not the same</p>
<p>as getting your hormones levels measured</p>
<p>or your metabolic factors measured.</p>
<p>That can be done and can be done rigorously.</p>
<p>There are tests out there.</p>
<p>There are even some, believe it or not,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some questionnaires, you know,</p>
<p>and I think actually last year</p>
<p>it made some of the bigger newspapers.</p>
<p>You know, are you more of a dopamine or a serotonin?</p>
<p>Are you a this or a that?</p>
<p>I find that stuff to be a little silly,</p>
<p>although I do appreciate and like the fact</p>
<p>that people are thinking about</p>
<p>and talking about neuromodulators.</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t really great ways</p>
<p>to measure these things outside the clinic.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some great clinical tools</p>
<p>that you can get inside of a hospital</p>
<p>or from a proper endocrinologist or neurologist,</p>
<p>but no great at-home tools.</p>
<p>So maybe that&rsquo;s a call to arms</p>
<p>for some of you entrepreneurial folks out there</p>
<p>to create these tests, accurate tests, please,</p>
<p>that could be done at home.</p>
<p>But you know, some people feel like they&rsquo;re too anxious</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re always in a motivated state</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re trying to adjust their serotonin.</p>
<p>Many people adjust their serotonin by just eating more food</p>
<p>and carbohydrate-rich foods will increase serotonin.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about this on a previous podcast,</p>
<p>but I personally am a big fan, at least for me,</p>
<p>as I usually fast and exercise in the early part of the day.</p>
<p>I eat a relatively high protein and moderate fat,</p>
<p>zero carb or low carb meal at lunch</p>
<p>and in the afternoon to stay alert</p>
<p>because those foods tend to favor dopamine production,</p>
<p>acetylcholine production,</p>
<p>epinephrine production, and alertness.</p>
<p>My mood is generally pretty good most of the time.</p>
<p>And then as evening comes around</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m concerned about sleep and a good night&rsquo;s sleep,</p>
<p>not concerned in an anxious way,</p>
<p>but I want to get a good night&rsquo;s sleep,</p>
<p>I will ingest foods that promote serotonin release</p>
<p>because they contain a lot of tryptophan.</p>
<p>So if I do eat meat,</p>
<p>it would be like a white meat turkey meat.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t tend to, I&rsquo;ve never liked turkey.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind the animal, but I don&rsquo;t like ingesting the meat.</p>
<p>But starchy carbohydrates will increase serotonin.</p>
<p>Some people also will take serotonin.</p>
<p>You can now buy 5-HTP supplements.</p>
<p>This is a little bit tricky.</p>
<p>5-HTP supplements can, of course, increase 5-HTP.</p>
<p>It is 5-HTP or serotonin,</p>
<p>but that sometimes can create problems</p>
<p>in endogenous or self-made production of serotonin.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m never a fan of taking things</p>
<p>very close to the chemical you&rsquo;re trying to increase</p>
<p>for very long periods of time, maybe for occasional use.</p>
<p>I have the problem that if I take serotonin supplements,</p>
<p>5-HTP, I fall asleep.</p>
<p>The sleep I have is very intense</p>
<p>and I wake up three or four hours later.</p>
<p>And we know based on sleep studies</p>
<p>with good measurements in the lab</p>
<p>that serotonin release tends to be</p>
<p>in the later part of the night.</p>
<p>And so by taking it early in the night,</p>
<p>it really can disrupt the pattern of sleep</p>
<p>and the depth of sleep.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, some people are interested in taking serotonin</p>
<p>to get some of the more blissed out effects.</p>
<p>You can achieve that with foods, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>that are carbohydrate rich.</p>
<p>So as you&rsquo;re seeing,</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t really a discussion about nutrition per se.</p>
<p>This is a discussion about food, which contains amino acids,</p>
<p>amino acids being the precursors to neuromodulators</p>
<p>and neuromodulators having a profound effect</p>
<p>on your overall state of alertness or calmness,</p>
<p>happiness, sadness, and wellbeing.</p>
<p>So there are a number of things that one can take,</p>
<p>as I mentioned, one of them being 5-HTP itself.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not recommending people take anything,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re interested in what this does</p>
<p>and you want to explore this,</p>
<p>of course, you&rsquo;d want permission from your doctor.</p>
<p>You can go to this free website.</p>
<p>I love this resource.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t pay me to say that, but I just love this resource.</p>
<p>I followed it for a long time, called examine.com.</p>
<p>Thank you folks at examine.com</p>
<p>for putting this free resource out on the web</p>
<p>that has links through what they call</p>
<p>the human effect matrix.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s links to all the PubMed studies</p>
<p>for particular effects of particular compounds</p>
<p>that one can buy and ingest.</p>
<p>Incredible, as well as important health warnings.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not going to read through everything,</p>
<p>but if you were to go to examine.com, as I have now,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d put in 5-HTP,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re only looking at things that have strong evidence.</p>
<p>PubMed articles, articles are in the PubMed archive.</p>
<p>So for instance, I didn&rsquo;t know this,</p>
<p>but 5-HTP produces a notable decrease in appetite.</p>
<p>Three studies.</p>
<p>And this appetite suppression makes sense, of course,</p>
<p>because we ingest foods to get serotonin.</p>
<p>And if we have enough serotonin,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s no reason to ingest more foods.</p>
<p>It tends to have a blunting of appetite.</p>
<p>It probably does that also through other mechanisms.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not saying you should do this,</p>
<p>but if someone&rsquo;s trying to blunt their appetite,</p>
<p>could be a interesting route.</p>
<p>Although I don&rsquo;t recommend chronic use.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, there&rsquo;s a decrease in body weight</p>
<p>as a consequence, an increase in cortisol.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of important to note</p>
<p>that when you typically in biology,</p>
<p>if you pull on one string really hard, another one moves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit like a puppet</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s more than one string on the puppet.</p>
<p>So it does seem to increase cortisol,</p>
<p>though they report as a minor effect.</p>
<p>Again, links to all those studies are there,</p>
<p>which is why I&rsquo;m not listing them out in our caption notes.</p>
<p>You can go and get them at examine.com,</p>
<p>put in serotonin and you&rsquo;ll find that.</p>
<p>So I find it fascinating that nowadays there are things</p>
<p>that are somewhere between doing nothing,</p>
<p>getting serotonin from tryptophan in foods</p>
<p>and prescription drugs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this other category of supplements</p>
<p>that are really interesting</p>
<p>for modulating these chemicals in the body.</p>
<p>And I should mention before I move on,</p>
<p>because I mentioned L-tyrosine,</p>
<p>I neglected to mention earlier</p>
<p>in our discussion about dopamine.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in the dopamine pathway,</p>
<p>go to examine.com, put in mucuna prurens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s M-U-C-U-N-A, separate word, P-R-U-R-I-E-N-S.</p>
<p>It is a velvet bean that grows from vines</p>
<p>and is very itchy to touch due to serotonin on its surface.</p>
<p>Amazing, this bean has serotonin on its surface.</p>
<p>And indeed serotonin, if you were to put it on your skin,</p>
<p>would cause some irritation of the skin, amazing.</p>
<p>Inside the bean is L-DOPA.</p>
<p>Mucuna prurens is not just something</p>
<p>that promotes dopamine release</p>
<p>because of some weird mystical ancient thing</p>
<p>or whatever, or sorcery.</p>
<p>It is chemically L-DOPA, the precursor to dopamine.</p>
<p>It contains some other molecules as well</p>
<p>and low levels of other psychoactives.</p>
<p>This stuff is available over the counter.</p>
<p>Incredible, I personally find it incredible.</p>
<p>Its effects are really interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to read them all off,</p>
<p>but I mentioned these effects</p>
<p>not because I&rsquo;m encouraging you to take it,</p>
<p>but because you get a window into what dopamine,</p>
<p>acute dopamine increase does</p>
<p>in the non-Parkinsonian context.</p>
<p>And you can start to think about foods</p>
<p>that are rich in L-tyrosine</p>
<p>as biasing certain effects or not others.</p>
<p>So when you hear food is medicine,</p>
<p>food isn&rsquo;t really medicine, food is food,</p>
<p>but food has these chemical effects as well.</p>
<p>So first one listed is three studies</p>
<p>with a very high rigor</p>
<p>that overall have a minor effect on,</p>
<p>of all things, sperm quality.</p>
<p>So it appears that sperm motility itself,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming when they say sperm quality,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what features of sperm of quality</p>
<p>they looked at with sperm.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a discussion I want to have,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m assuming it&rsquo;s motility</p>
<p>because I know enough about reproductive biology</p>
<p>to know that sperm&rsquo;s ability to swim</p>
<p>depends on some proteins that are present</p>
<p>in the front of the sperm, et cetera,</p>
<p>things like pentraxins,</p>
<p>and sperm motility is generally associated</p>
<p>with sperm quality.</p>
<p>Sperm that don&rsquo;t move are generally not very useful sperm.</p>
<p>Symptoms of Parkinson disease</p>
<p>are notably degraded with macune appearance.</p>
<p>So fascinating, that&rsquo;s not surprising.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of other effects here.</p>
<p>Feelings of subjective wellbeing,</p>
<p>testosterone, reductions in prolactin, not surprising.</p>
<p>Prolactin is a hormone that&rsquo;s involved in milk letdown.</p>
<p>In lactating mothers, it&rsquo;s involved in feelings of peace</p>
<p>and generally is antagonistic to sexual desire</p>
<p>in both men and female.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really interesting that things like macune appearance</p>
<p>which are L-DOPA, reduced prolactin, increased sperm motility,</p>
<p>increased testosterone, subjective wellbeing.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re starting to see a theme, right?</p>
<p>Dopamine really makes us motivated,</p>
<p>feel in pursuit, makes us feel good.</p>
<p>Serotonin makes us feel more relaxed and calm.</p>
<p>Now, this whole month is about emotion.</p>
<p>So you might be thinking, well, wait,</p>
<p>where are we going with all this as it relates to emotions?</p>
<p>But in the last episode,</p>
<p>I said something I&rsquo;m going to repeat it now briefly,</p>
<p>which is that much of what we talk about</p>
<p>is good emotions or bad emotions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a context to that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a social context.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t really say an emotion is good or bad.</p>
<p>Grieving at a funeral is healthy, okay?</p>
<p>Being happy at a funeral,</p>
<p>assuming you loved the person that died,</p>
<p>is most people probably wouldn&rsquo;t think that was healthy.</p>
<p>So we can&rsquo;t really say that certain emotions</p>
<p>like sadness or happiness are healthy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s context is important.</p>
<p>Cultural context is important.</p>
<p>Many of you have asked for book recommendations.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity to raise a mention of another book.</p>
<p>Again, I don&rsquo;t have any financial affiliation or anything,</p>
<p>but if you want to read more about emotions</p>
<p>and how the context and cultural things</p>
<p>impact our emotions, I&rsquo;m a huge fan of Lisa Feldman Barrett.</p>
<p>I learned about her from the Lex Fridman podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had discussions with her on my Instagram Live.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s at Northeastern University,</p>
<p>a world expert in emotions.</p>
<p>Her first book is, How Emotions Are Made.</p>
<p>This is not a book she sent me.</p>
<p>I paid for this with my own money years ago.</p>
<p>Bought it, read it, loved it long before I met Lisa.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just delighted that we&rsquo;ve got to known each other</p>
<p>a little bit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really interesting read into the psychology</p>
<p>of emotions and some of the subjectivity of emotions.</p>
<p>So whereas I&rsquo;m talking about mainly the biology of emotions,</p>
<p>this gets a little bit more into the psychology,</p>
<p>although the biology as well.</p>
<p>And Lisa&rsquo;s just terrific.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s also putting a lot of information out into the world</p>
<p>about emotions.</p>
<p>So if you want to learn more about that,</p>
<p>check out her work.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s Lisa Feldman Barrett,</p>
<p>and that book is How Emotions Are Made.</p>
<p>Hopefully she&rsquo;ll continue to write many more books.</p>
<p>So now you understand the relationship, I hope,</p>
<p>between foods and dopamine, foods and serotonin,</p>
<p>and that they&rsquo;re both being communicated to the brain</p>
<p>via the vagus, right?</p>
<p>We ingest these foods.</p>
<p>These supplements are things people take.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t put them directly into the brain.</p>
<p>They put them in our gut.</p>
<p>So yes, there&rsquo;s a gut-brain connection,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not about the serotonin in the gut</p>
<p>that makes you feel calm and placid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about the dopamine in the gut.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just been oversold that way</p>
<p>because I think there&rsquo;s something really attractive,</p>
<p>and I understand about the idea that</p>
<p>because certain things about our experience of life</p>
<p>and our emotions is happening in our body</p>
<p>that maybe we have a little more control, right?</p>
<p>Because this thing is a hard container.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t just stuff some dopamine in there.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t just, you know,</p>
<p>I could probably take a mucuna prurines bean</p>
<p>and stuff it in my ear.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d make my ear itchy</p>
<p>because of the serotonin on the outside,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t get stuff in there.</p>
<p>What you have to do is ingest things</p>
<p>that are metabolized in certain ways</p>
<p>that communicate to the brain,</p>
<p>or so maybe they pass into the brain themselves</p>
<p>across what&rsquo;s called the blood-brain barrier.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to talk about the blood-brain barrier in a minute.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually called the BBB.</p>
<p>So it ends up sounding like baby, BBB.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s like BB.</p>
<p>Anyway, BBB.</p>
<p>But there are also nerves in the gut</p>
<p>that are sensing the nutrient contents of food</p>
<p>and then saying, oh, you should feel better and want more.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s got a lot of bitterness and acid taste to it.</p>
<p>You should want less of that, okay?</p>
<p>So as I transition out of the discussion</p>
<p>about dopamine and serotonin in the gut,</p>
<p>hopefully you&rsquo;ve got some actionable items</p>
<p>there under your belt, pun intended,</p>
<p>where you can understand how certain foods</p>
<p>and certain nutrients, and you can look these up,</p>
<p>might impact your mood.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s really anxious and really wired,</p>
<p>well, then the dopamine-adrenaline pathway,</p>
<p>epinephrine pathway is probably not one</p>
<p>that you want to lean on any harder.</p>
<p>If you tend to be someone who&rsquo;s pretty passive</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re having trouble with motivation,</p>
<p>well, then think about ramping up the dopamine pathway.</p>
<p>I always think behaviors and proper food choices</p>
<p>is the best way to start,</p>
<p>and behaviors include things like exercise, et cetera.</p>
<p>But one of the problems with the discussion</p>
<p>around mood and exercise or mood and meditation</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s so subjective.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I love certain forms of exercise and not others.</p>
<p>Certain ones are aversive to me.</p>
<p>Certain ones are attractive to me.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s never really clear.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s ever told me, okay, you have to do 10 minutes</p>
<p>on the bike at X number of RPM at so-and-so</p>
<p>or on the skier in order to get your dopamine up.</p>
<p>But we can actually say, if you ingest more L-tyrosine,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a high probability</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to make more dopamine.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m talking about ingesting it through food</p>
<p>or through supplementation, if you like.</p>
<p>Macuna purines, I&rsquo;ve tried, I should just mention.</p>
<p>It was too dopaminergic for me.</p>
<p>I really, really jazzed up</p>
<p>and then severe crash for me the next day.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s, I think, because I tend to ride pretty high</p>
<p>on the kind of alertness and motivation scale.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always being told by Costello</p>
<p>and other people in the podcast studio</p>
<p>to slow my speech down.</p>
<p>This is me uncaffeinated.</p>
<p>And I could probably afford a little more serotonin</p>
<p>in my life.</p>
<p>So, whereas Costello, he could afford,</p>
<p>well, he could afford to wake up every couple days</p>
<p>and just say hello to us.</p>
<p>This dog sleeps more than any other creature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s remarkable.</p>
<p>So there are things that we can do and they&rsquo;re actionable.</p>
<p>And they are, in some ways, they&rsquo;re quantitative</p>
<p>because you can regulate dosages</p>
<p>and you can regulate amounts and you can regulate timing.</p>
<p>And everyone has to play with these things</p>
<p>and figure out what&rsquo;s right for them in terms of feeding.</p>
<p>And everyone has to explore and understand</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s safe and right for them.</p>
<p>But, and of course, exercise is still very important.</p>
<p>I talked about social connection in the last episode,</p>
<p>super important for activation of serotonin.</p>
<p>But when it comes to this gut-brain, body-brain relationship,</p>
<p>what we eat really matters</p>
<p>in terms of the neurochemicals that we make.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk a little bit more</p>
<p>about things that we ingest in our body</p>
<p>and then allow our body to inform our brain</p>
<p>to shift our mood.</p>
<p>And this is something I&rsquo;ve been doing for years.</p>
<p>And I just want to say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found to be a complete game changer.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s excellent science to support it.</p>
<p>And I think most people are familiar with it</p>
<p>in a different context,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think most people know this simple fact,</p>
<p>which is that the omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acid ratio</p>
<p>has a profound effect on depression.</p>
<p>It has a profound effect on mood.</p>
<p>So much so that in a double-blind placebo-controlled study</p>
<p>that I will provide the link to,</p>
<p>this was a study first published in 2008,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;ve been many others as well.</p>
<p>First of all, in an experiment done in animals,</p>
<p>they found there&rsquo;s a model of learned helplessness</p>
<p>in animals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not very kind to the animals,</p>
<p>but they put rats or mice in a jar,</p>
<p>they let them swim and they&rsquo;ll swim, swim, swim</p>
<p>to try and save their life.</p>
<p>And eventually they give up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a learned helplessness.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t let them drown, they take them out.</p>
<p>Adjusting the omega-3, omega-6 ratio</p>
<p>so that the omega-3s are higher</p>
<p>led to less learned helplessness,</p>
<p>meaning these animals would swim longer.</p>
<p>Okay, now that&rsquo;s an animal, that&rsquo;s a rat,</p>
<p>not a particularly kind study.</p>
<p>But that same study was essentially done in humans,</p>
<p>although they didn&rsquo;t have them swim</p>
<p>to the point of near drowning.</p>
<p>What they did is they took people</p>
<p>who were clinically depressed, major depression.</p>
<p>Okay, major depression is severe maladaptive state,</p>
<p>meaning it inhibits job, relationships, appetite,</p>
<p>all sorts of negative health effects.</p>
<p>And they did a comparison of 1,000 milligrams a day of EPA.</p>
<p>So EPA is one of the elements</p>
<p>that contains high levels of omega-3s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in things like fish oil.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about other sources in a little bit,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t 1,000 milligrams of fish oil,</p>
<p>it was 1,000 milligrams of EPA.</p>
<p>Compared that to 20 milligrams of fluoxetine,</p>
<p>which is Prozac, okay, really increases serotonin.</p>
<p>And in this study of 60 individuals,</p>
<p>again, I&rsquo;ll provide the links to the study,</p>
<p>they found that they were equally effective</p>
<p>in reducing depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>So imagine that, a food-based compound</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t make without, right?</p>
<p>This is not a situation</p>
<p>where you can make your own omega-3s,</p>
<p>you have to get them from food sources</p>
<p>or from supplementation,</p>
<p>was as effective as 20 milligrams of fluoxetine</p>
<p>over the course of eight weeks.</p>
<p>And what was really interesting in addition to that</p>
<p>is that the combination of 1,000 milligrams of EPA</p>
<p>and fluoxetine had a synergistic effect</p>
<p>in lowering depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>I find this remarkable.</p>
<p>I heard about this when it first came out</p>
<p>and I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to make of it</p>
<p>because there are a lot of studies that come out</p>
<p>and I generally like to focus my changes in behavior</p>
<p>around things where there&rsquo;s a large center of mass,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of information.</p>
<p>A couple of years later,</p>
<p>I did in fact start taking 1,000 milligrams per day of EPA</p>
<p>in fish oil.</p>
<p>Now, there are a few side effects of fish oil.</p>
<p>People who have blood, who are bleeders,</p>
<p>who have factor V Leiden mutations,</p>
<p>or women who are taking birth control,</p>
<p>which can affect blood clotting and things of that sort,</p>
<p>really should talk to your doctor,</p>
<p>make sure it&rsquo;s okay for you.</p>
<p>Fish oil also can give people fishy breath,</p>
<p>which is pretty gross, frankly,</p>
<p>but there are now fish oils</p>
<p>that either because of the encapsulations</p>
<p>or because they put some lemon flavoring in there</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have that effect.</p>
<p>In any event, 1,000 milligrams per day of EPA,</p>
<p>I started ingesting that regularly.</p>
<p>I just felt better.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t clinically depressed,</p>
<p>but I did feel, at least for me,</p>
<p>an increase in mood and affect</p>
<p>and a number of other things</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s supposed to reduce inflammation.</p>
<p>The cardiovascular effects are controversial.</p>
<p>For a long time, everyone thought</p>
<p>the effects on platelets were really terrific.</p>
<p>Then there were articles that came out in major newspapers</p>
<p>saying maybe not so much,</p>
<p>but the effects on mood are really profound.</p>
<p>And now there are lots of studies.</p>
<p>If you go into PubMed and you were to put EPA</p>
<p>or fish oil and depression,</p>
<p>you would find that there were a number</p>
<p>of really impressive results</p>
<p>showing that it&rsquo;s at least as effective</p>
<p>as certain SSRIs, antidepressants, at these dosages.</p>
<p>And it can amplify or improve the effect of low dosages</p>
<p>of some of these SSRIs.</p>
<p>So I feel like more people should know about this.</p>
<p>This is nutrition, but it&rsquo;s profoundly affecting mood.</p>
<p>And depression is terrible, right?</p>
<p>Depression can have a component of anxiety in some cases</p>
<p>where people feel lousy and very uncertain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of how I talk about depression with anxiety</p>
<p>is you talk to someone who&rsquo;s anxious</p>
<p>and you can tell them everything&rsquo;s going to be okay, okay.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re always concerned</p>
<p>about what they might not know.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really know the plane isn&rsquo;t going to crash.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really know that life is going to go okay.</p>
<p>And in some sense, they&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>No one has a crystal ball or can predict the future,</p>
<p>but they tend to perseverate or fixate on the uncertainty.</p>
<p>And then of course there are the versions of depression</p>
<p>that involve certainty.</p>
<p>People are lethargic and they&rsquo;re certain.</p>
<p>They say, yeah, I&rsquo;m certain</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m never going to get another job.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certain I&rsquo;m never going to meet anyone new.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certain I&rsquo;m going to fail.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this kind of a divide in the sphere of depression</p>
<p>around certainty and uncertainty.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s interesting is this thousand milligrams per day</p>
<p>or more of EPA has been shown to relief</p>
<p>both forms of depression.</p>
<p>Now, does that mean it&rsquo;s going to work for everybody?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not here to try and play psychiatrist.</p>
<p>I want to point you in the direction of these manuscripts</p>
<p>so that you can make informed choices for yourself.</p>
<p>You can discuss it with your doctor and family</p>
<p>and make the choices that are right for you.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s especially interesting</p>
<p>about the heart effects,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve heard that these omega-3s,</p>
<p>which of course you can get from other sources too.</p>
<p>You can get from fatty fish.</p>
<p>There are flax seeds, hemp seeds.</p>
<p>There are a number of chia seeds, these kinds of things.</p>
<p>But the levels of EPA that are required are quite high.</p>
<p>So this thousand milligrams per day,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty hard to get from food,</p>
<p>although it can be done depending on what you&rsquo;re eating.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is that the heart effects</p>
<p>that are solid, that really stand up in the literature,</p>
<p>have a lot more to do with something we talked about</p>
<p>in a previous episode and I&rsquo;ll mention again,</p>
<p>which is heart rate variability.</p>
<p>So we know that having a heart rate that&rsquo;s really high</p>
<p>or a heart rate that&rsquo;s really low,</p>
<p>neither of those are good.</p>
<p>A lot of people think,</p>
<p>oh, you just want a low heart rate, big stroke volume.</p>
<p>You know, if you&rsquo;re running a lot,</p>
<p>you may have 30 or 40 beats per minute.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great to be in shape,</p>
<p>but you still want heart rate variability.</p>
<p>It has a lot to do with the tone</p>
<p>of the autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>I talked about last time how when you inhale,</p>
<p>it speeds up heart rate.</p>
<p>When you exhale, it decreases heart rate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called respiratory sinus arrhythmia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the basis of heart rate variability.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll maybe do a short post about this</p>
<p>so you can get all the mechanism</p>
<p>and the behaviors that spill out of that</p>
<p>that might be useful for you.</p>
<p>But the point is heart rate variability, HRV is good.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting is that there was a study in 2009</p>
<p>that showed that people who eat a diet</p>
<p>and fail to supplement in a way</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a high omega-6 to 3 ratio,</p>
<p>so not enough omega-3s,</p>
<p>not only are there markers</p>
<p>of inflammatory cytokines elevated,</p>
<p>things like IL-6 and TNF-alpha,</p>
<p>but they tend to be non-responders to antidepressants.</p>
<p>Shifting that omega-3, omega-6 ratio did a couple things.</p>
<p>First of all, increasing the amount of EPA,</p>
<p>shifted the ratio so it was higher omega-3</p>
<p>to omega-6 ratio, which was good,</p>
<p>lowered the inflammation markers,</p>
<p>and then allowed antidepressants to have their effect</p>
<p>even at low doses.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the really interesting thing.</p>
<p>It worked by increasing heart rate variability.</p>
<p>And you think, well, how in the world would this happen?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a ton of effects,</p>
<p>but the way it works is because of the way</p>
<p>that these things are impacting the gut</p>
<p>and the autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>Remember earlier I said the vagus includes connections</p>
<p>from the heart signaling about sensory information</p>
<p>about how fast the heart is beating to the brain,</p>
<p>not just stuff from the lungs,</p>
<p>but information from the heart,</p>
<p>and the brain then adjusts heart rate</p>
<p>by heart rate variability.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s incredible that there&rsquo;s a way</p>
<p>that one can use the gut,</p>
<p>the ingestion of more of these EPAs,</p>
<p>either through food or supplementation,</p>
<p>to increase heart rate variability,</p>
<p>and thereby to improve symptoms,</p>
<p>meaning reduce symptoms of depression,</p>
<p>and to even make low levels of antidepressants</p>
<p>that wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise work, work.</p>
<p>And I think I like this study so much</p>
<p>because A, it&rsquo;s super cool.</p>
<p>It bridges the brain-body axis.</p>
<p>It incorporates nutrition and micronutrients in the brain,</p>
<p>but also because it really points to something</p>
<p>that we hear all the time,</p>
<p>which is that our body is a whole system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s working as a whole system,</p>
<p>and the brain isn&rsquo;t working in isolation up there</p>
<p>in the skull.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s reacting to things that are happening in the body,</p>
<p>in the gut, and in the heart rate,</p>
<p>and heart rate variability,</p>
<p>and that the things we ingest</p>
<p>can have a profound effect on them.</p>
<p>Now, of course, I really want to emphasize something,</p>
<p>which is that no one compound,</p>
<p>or nutrient, or supplement, or drug,</p>
<p>or behavior for that matter,</p>
<p>is going to be the be-all, end-all</p>
<p>of shifting out of depression,</p>
<p>or improving one&rsquo;s mood, or improving sleep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a constellation of things.</p>
<p>And this is especially true</p>
<p>when people start to get excited</p>
<p>about supplements and drugs of all kinds,</p>
<p>and their potential for various things.</p>
<p>Right now, there&rsquo;s a lot of excitement about psychedelics</p>
<p>and their therapeutic uses, and I think, great.</p>
<p>But as a good friend of mine,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a physician clinician says,</p>
<p>better living through chemistry</p>
<p>still requires better living.</p>
<p>You cannot expect to take a compound,</p>
<p>regardless of source or potency,</p>
<p>and have it completely shift your experience of life</p>
<p>without having to continue to engage</p>
<p>in the proper behaviors, all the things we know,</p>
<p>proper sleep, exercise, social connection, food, et cetera.</p>
<p>There are many others as well.</p>
<p>So I still find that this collection of studies</p>
<p>about omega-3 to omega-6 ratios to be profoundly important,</p>
<p>so much so that it&rsquo;s completely changed</p>
<p>the way that I think about food, the foods I eat.</p>
<p>I do supplement.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily think that&rsquo;s for everybody,</p>
<p>but I really think it&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>that there are these compounds</p>
<p>that have these robust effects on our feelings of wellbeing.</p>
<p>And there are others too.</p>
<p>So that 1,000 milligram per day threshold of fish oil</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s beneficial requires that one take</p>
<p>a reasonable amount of these things,</p>
<p>either through food or through supplementation.</p>
<p>I acknowledge that not everyone wants to take fish oil.</p>
<p>There are a couple of reasons</p>
<p>why one might want to avoid that.</p>
<p>One would be for ethical reasons.</p>
<p>You have an emotional relationship</p>
<p>or a relationship to the environment</p>
<p>that makes you not want to ingest fish-related products.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s krill oil.</p>
<p>Krill is still an organism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little tiny thing that whales eat a lot of,</p>
<p>and people generally eat very little of.</p>
<p>So krill is out there.</p>
<p>I personally, just me, I don&rsquo;t know why,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t react well to krill.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t make me feel very good.</p>
<p>I had some like kind of skin itchies and things like that,</p>
<p>and they stopped when I stopped taking it.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t want to bias you against it</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s your preference.</p>
<p>Some people really like krill oil as a source of omega-3s.</p>
<p>I did mention some of the other sources</p>
<p>like chia seeds and flax seeds.</p>
<p>But as you&rsquo;ll notice, these are not things</p>
<p>that we tend to ingest a lot of on a regular basis.</p>
<p>It is possible to get omega-3s from meats</p>
<p>if the animals have grazed on grasses</p>
<p>that contain a lot of omega-3s.</p>
<p>So for those of you that ingest meat,</p>
<p>the source of those meats is going to be very important</p>
<p>as it relates to omega-3s.</p>
<p>Even within the category of fish oil,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a concern sometimes about mercury</p>
<p>and other contaminants.</p>
<p>You want to go with a brand that emphasizes</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve gone to really good sources</p>
<p>and that they decontaminate regardless.</p>
<p>And so you have to search out those brands.</p>
<p>There is a test that you can do</p>
<p>as to whether or not the fish oil is rancid or not.</p>
<p>Some people take in liquid form.</p>
<p>Some people take in capsule form.</p>
<p>The liquid form is going to be more affordable.</p>
<p>The capsule form is a little easier and a little more</p>
<p>portable.</p>
<p>You can actually just chew one of the gel tablets.</p>
<p>And if it tastes really fishy and kind of rancid,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll know it&rsquo;s disgusting.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll want to spit it out.</p>
<p>And if it doesn&rsquo;t and it&rsquo;s tolerable,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ll know that it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you have to buy it first in order to do that.</p>
<p>Although, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>maybe you can get them to open up the bottle for you</p>
<p>in the store and tell them that you don&rsquo;t want to try it.</p>
<p>Someday, perhaps fish oil and omega-3s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be like tasting wine in a restaurant</p>
<p>where you can send it back.</p>
<p>For now, I think you have to purchase it first,</p>
<p>but find a brand you trust and like,</p>
<p>and then work with them</p>
<p>if you decide to go that route, of course.</p>
<p>There are other compounds that are also interesting</p>
<p>for mood elevation that are essentially like foods</p>
<p>or are supplement-based that now, fortunately,</p>
<p>there are really good data from peer-reviewed studies.</p>
<p>And the next one I want to mention,</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s really interesting, is L-carnitine.</p>
<p>Now, L-carnitine has been around a long time</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been discussed in the context of heart health</p>
<p>and a number of other things.</p>
<p>It was actually in tout as a bit of a weight loss agent</p>
<p>in the early 90s.</p>
<p>But L-carnitine actually has some really impressive effects</p>
<p>on depression.</p>
<p>And again, we will look to PubMed</p>
<p>because looking at examine.com is essentially,</p>
<p>for me anyway, looking at PubMed, what is L-carnitine?</p>
<p>Okay, L-carnitine is most prevalent in meat</p>
<p>and in beef in particular.</p>
<p>Now, for the vegans, please know that L-carnitine</p>
<p>is available through non-meat sources as well,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s not as enriched in non-meat sources.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really interesting molecule</p>
<p>because L-cetyl L-carnitine</p>
<p>is essentially what&rsquo;s made from L-carnitine,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s acetylated.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in the biochemistry,</p>
<p>you can look that up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s acetylated into a form</p>
<p>that can cross the blood-brain barrier.</p>
<p>The blood-brain barrier or BBB is a barrier.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wall around the brain.</p>
<p>And you have this barrier because the brain is so important</p>
<p>and it has this feature that the neurons there</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t recreate themselves after injury</p>
<p>like other organs of the body.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a lot of turnover of cells</p>
<p>despite what you might&rsquo;ve heard.</p>
<p>And so nature has created this BBB,</p>
<p>this blood-brain barrier,</p>
<p>to make sure that certain molecules,</p>
<p>in particular large molecules,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get across the blood-brain barrier</p>
<p>because it can be damaging to those tissues.</p>
<p>Incidentally, you also have a very rigid</p>
<p>or stringent barrier around other organs,</p>
<p>which are the gonads.</p>
<p>So the ovaries and the testes and the brain</p>
<p>are the organs of the body</p>
<p>that nature has gone out of its way to protect,</p>
<p>give this additional layer of the blood-brain barrier,</p>
<p>or as you might imagine for the testes and the ovaries,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be the blood-gonadal barrier.</p>
<p>So these barriers exist and make it such</p>
<p>that just because you eat something,</p>
<p>just because you ingest it,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s going to cross the blood-brain barrier.</p>
<p>But L-carnitine, when taken,</p>
<p>is acetylated and converted into this form</p>
<p>that gets across the blood-brain barrier.</p>
<p>And it has a lot of effects.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s involved in mitochondrial activation</p>
<p>of long-chain fatty acids, which that&rsquo;s a big mouthful</p>
<p>that we could get into sometime</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re talking about metabolics,</p>
<p>but it has some interesting effects on the neuro side.</p>
<p>So if you decide to check it out on examine.com,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see some really interesting things,</p>
<p>lots of effects on ammonia, C-reactive proteins,</p>
<p>things of that sort, blood glucose is lowered, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all stuff that&rsquo;s the level of blood in periphery,</p>
<p>slight effects in lowering cholesterol.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some interesting ones.</p>
<p>Rates of pregnancy go way up</p>
<p>when people are taking L-carnitine.</p>
<p>Both the father and the mother,</p>
<p>both the source of sperm and the source of egg</p>
<p>are affected in ways that favor pregnancy.</p>
<p>It does increase, here we go again,</p>
<p>with sperm quality, sperm motility in males.</p>
<p>And it seems to have positive effects on females</p>
<p>that have polycystic ovary syndrome.</p>
<p>So check that out.</p>
<p>The effects are very strong.</p>
<p>There are three studies listed there.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not promoting this,</p>
<p>but that people take L-carnitine,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re trying to get pregnant,</p>
<p>but check it out because the effects there</p>
<p>and the studies that are mentioned</p>
<p>are published in peer-reviewed rigorous journals.</p>
<p>In terms of the neural effects, those are quite interesting.</p>
<p>The effects on depression are still emerging,</p>
<p>but they do seem to exist,</p>
<p>that people feel a notable decrease in depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>There are seven studies listed on examine.com</p>
<p>that it has a notable benefit in a variety of circumstances</p>
<p>where participants have heightened depression already.</p>
<p>They start taking L-carnitine and they start feeling better.</p>
<p>And they talk about dosages in those various studies.</p>
<p>It also has been shown to have a notable decrease</p>
<p>in the symptoms of autism, which I find fascinating.</p>
<p>Also, again, the things we ingest</p>
<p>impact the chemicals in our brain</p>
<p>and how they impact the rest of our body.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other things that&rsquo;s been used</p>
<p>to treat certain forms of alcohol dependence.</p>
<p>I think this is going to be a very exciting emerging area.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to do a whole month about addiction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a great guest lined up for that month,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s now an emerging field</p>
<p>about what people can take and supplement</p>
<p>to help ease the cravings and the withdrawal</p>
<p>when trying to quit drugs of abuse like cocaine,</p>
<p>alcohol, heroin, and smoking and things of that sort.</p>
<p>So really interesting area.</p>
<p>This is, I like to think is early days</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to discover a lot more.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge list of things here.</p>
<p>Since we talked about pain on a previous episode</p>
<p>and I know a lot of people have written to me</p>
<p>about fibromyalgia, L-carnitine has been shown</p>
<p>to reduce symptoms of fibromyalgia.</p>
<p>Again, all the links to studies are on examine.com,</p>
<p>totally free site.</p>
<p>And that was my bulldog being a battering ram.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing graceful about this bulldog.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s decided he wanted to leave to go get a drink of water.</p>
<p>And so please forgive the noise.</p>
<p>Okay, so now let&rsquo;s turn to another aspect</p>
<p>of the gut brain relationship that will surprise you,</p>
<p>in some cases might shock you,</p>
<p>and that has some really cool and actionable biology.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the gut microbiome, probiotics, and prebiotics.</p>
<p>I know today we&rsquo;re talking about emotions and not pain,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t mention another effect</p>
<p>of acetyl L-carnitine that&rsquo;s been reported</p>
<p>and that you can find listed with link to study</p>
<p>on examine.com, which is its effect</p>
<p>in reducing the symptoms of migraine.</p>
<p>This was a randomized control trial</p>
<p>with 133 participants who had frequent migraines.</p>
<p>They were taking 500 milligrams of L-carnitine</p>
<p>or nothing for 12 weeks.</p>
<p>So the control is a little bit,</p>
<p>the control experiment there is a little bit tricky,</p>
<p>but it had a significant effect</p>
<p>on reducing the number of migraine attacks per month.</p>
<p>So I find that really interesting.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot more listed there about the study.</p>
<p>And I think these compounds are powerful.</p>
<p>They carry risks for certain people, not for others.</p>
<p>So again, you have to find out what&rsquo;s right for you,</p>
<p>but I do think they are super interesting</p>
<p>as potential therapeutics for various people.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the deal with the gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the gut-brain axis?</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;ve actually been talking a lot already</p>
<p>about the gut-brain axis</p>
<p>that has nothing to do with microbiomes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been talking about this vagus nerve</p>
<p>that connects providing sensory information</p>
<p>from the body to the brain.</p>
<p>And then the brain also sends in the same nerve</p>
<p>motor information to control the motility,</p>
<p>the gut, the heart rate, how fast we breathe</p>
<p>and deployment of immune stuff,</p>
<p>killer cells and things of that sort.</p>
<p>But oftentimes when we hear</p>
<p>about the gut-brain axis these days,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a discussion about the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>And once again, we&rsquo;re in a situation</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s incredible biology.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very happy there&rsquo;s so much discussion</p>
<p>about the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>I am somewhat dismayed and concerned</p>
<p>that most of what I hear out there</p>
<p>is either false or partially false.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to clear up some of the misconceptions</p>
<p>first by understanding the biology.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>some of the actionable items.</p>
<p>It is true that we have a lot</p>
<p>of these little microorganisms living in our gut.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not there because they want to help us.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have brains.</p>
<p>They are adaptive, however,</p>
<p>they try and find and create environments</p>
<p>that make it easier for them to proliferate.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t care about you and me,</p>
<p>but they are perfectly willing to exploit you and me</p>
<p>in order to make more of themselves.</p>
<p>The same way viruses are.</p>
<p>Viruses don&rsquo;t have a mind, they infect cells,</p>
<p>they hijack the genome</p>
<p>and they use that genome to make more of themselves.</p>
<p>The microbiota that live in us</p>
<p>vary along the length of our digestive tract.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s just take a step back</p>
<p>and think about how our body plan is made.</p>
<p>We are actually a series of tubes.</p>
<p>Our brain is actually a tube.</p>
<p>You see, it&rsquo;s all squishy on the outside.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s got that long thing,</p>
<p>the spinal cord that goes down to the base of the spine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the central nervous system.</p>
<p>That all started out as a tube.</p>
<p>It just looks like a cauliflower on the other end</p>
<p>up in the brain because the tube is so big</p>
<p>and it has to be crammed into the skull</p>
<p>so it gets all wrinkled up.</p>
<p>But if we were to splay it out,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d find that it&rsquo;s just one big tube.</p>
<p>Similarly, our digestive tract and our airways</p>
<p>are essentially one big tube.</p>
<p>It starts with our mouth, also our nose.</p>
<p>And then we have all these other tubes</p>
<p>that go down through our throat and then into our stomach</p>
<p>and then into our various intestines.</p>
<p>And then the tube ends out the other end.</p>
<p>So we are one long tube for digestion.</p>
<p>And inside of that tube is a mucosal lining.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s these little microvilli, tiny, tiny, tiny,</p>
<p>little like velvety ends of cells</p>
<p>that are able to move and move things along.</p>
<p>And mucus, mucosa.</p>
<p>And the conditions of that mucosal lining</p>
<p>set a number of different things.</p>
<p>It sets the rate of our digestion</p>
<p>and the quality of our digestion.</p>
<p>It sets, for instance, our immune system.</p>
<p>Most people probably don&rsquo;t realize this,</p>
<p>but most infections in the environment,</p>
<p>well, they have to get into our body somehow.</p>
<p>Some of them are inhaled.</p>
<p>A lot of them go into our mouth</p>
<p>and lodge in the mucosal lining of the mouth.</p>
<p>And then infections start there.</p>
<p>You probably had the experience, unfortunately,</p>
<p>of feeling like you have a tick in your throat,</p>
<p>like something&rsquo;s irritating your throat.</p>
<p>And then it kind of migrates up into a head cold</p>
<p>or runny nose.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;ll start as a headache.</p>
<p>Sometimes it won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But things that can migrate down into the gut.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re ingesting things all the time.</p>
<p>Think about air, bacteria, viruses,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re making their way into our gut.</p>
<p>And some of those bacteria live in the gut.</p>
<p>And some of those bacteria</p>
<p>bias the mucosal lining in the gut,</p>
<p>stomach and intestines,</p>
<p>to be more acidic or more basic</p>
<p>so that they can make more of themselves,</p>
<p>so they can replicate.</p>
<p>They like a particular comfort.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like they like a particular kind of bedding</p>
<p>to lie down in and create more of themselves.</p>
<p>Now, some of those mucosal linings that they promote</p>
<p>make us feel better.</p>
<p>They make us feel more alert.</p>
<p>They bolster our immune system</p>
<p>and others make us feel worse.</p>
<p>So first rule,</p>
<p>the microbiome isn&rsquo;t good or bad.</p>
<p>Some of these little bugs that live in us</p>
<p>do bad things to us.</p>
<p>They make us feel worse.</p>
<p>They lower our immunity.</p>
<p>They affect us in negative ways.</p>
<p>Some of them make us feel better.</p>
<p>And they do that mainly by changing the conditions</p>
<p>of our gut environment.</p>
<p>In addition to that,</p>
<p>they do impact the neurotransmitters</p>
<p>and the neurons that live in the gut</p>
<p>and that signal up to the brain</p>
<p>to impact things like dopamine and serotonin</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been talking about previously.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a vast world now</p>
<p>devoted to trying to understand what sources of food,</p>
<p>what kinds of foods are good or not good</p>
<p>for the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just talk about some general rules of thumb</p>
<p>related to the research,</p>
<p>quality research that&rsquo;s peer reviewed.</p>
<p>And then in a future episode,</p>
<p>we will go far deeper into the gut microbiome</p>
<p>and gut brain axis.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s a few things</p>
<p>that I think you might find surprising.</p>
<p>First of all,</p>
<p>supporting a healthy gut microbiome is good for mood,</p>
<p>great for digestion and great for immune system function.</p>
<p>However, that does not mean maxing out</p>
<p>or taking the most probiotic and prebiotic</p>
<p>that you can possibly manage.</p>
<p>As I mentioned many times before,</p>
<p>I do believe in probiotics, I take probiotics,</p>
<p>but there are studies that show</p>
<p>that if you take lots and lots of certain probiotics</p>
<p>like lactobacillus and you really ramp up the levels more,</p>
<p>it is not a case of more is better.</p>
<p>There are things like brain fog that can come from that.</p>
<p>Brain fog is just this inability to focus.</p>
<p>People feel really not well generally.</p>
<p>Some of those studies are a little bit controversial,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s fair to say</p>
<p>that if people really increase the amount of probiotic</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re taking beyond a certain amount,</p>
<p>then they start feeling foggy in the mind.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s too much?</p>
<p>Well, I get probiotics from,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned before, from athletic greens.</p>
<p>You can get them from fermented foods like sauerkraut,</p>
<p>pickles, kimchi, natto.</p>
<p>These are different sources from around the world.</p>
<p>Actually, I&rsquo;d love to hear some of the other sources</p>
<p>that people know, other foods from around the world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated by the way in which different cultures</p>
<p>have all arrived at these foods that provide</p>
<p>and support healthy microbiomes because they&rsquo;re fermented.</p>
<p>I have a colleague at Stanford, Justin Sonnenberg.</p>
<p>He and I have talked about this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to quote him inappropriately,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve had discussions about it</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve published that the ingestion of fermented foods</p>
<p>is one of the best ways to support healthy levels</p>
<p>of gut microbiota without exceeding the threshold</p>
<p>that would cause things like brain fog.</p>
<p>So foods and fermented foods are going to be the best source</p>
<p>and there are a number of different ways</p>
<p>that one could do that.</p>
<p>Some people don&rsquo;t like fermented foods, however.</p>
<p>Some people supplement it.</p>
<p>So it isn&rsquo;t a case of more is better.</p>
<p>Okay, so we know that.</p>
<p>The other is that it is true that healthy gut microbiota</p>
<p>have been shown to improve symptoms</p>
<p>of certain psychiatric illnesses,</p>
<p>as well as certain conditions like particular features</p>
<p>along the autism spectrum, which is interesting.</p>
<p>And those effects are probably due</p>
<p>to not just improvement of immune system function,</p>
<p>but to the conditions in which the neurons</p>
<p>that sense nutrients convey information to the brain</p>
<p>and increased levels of serotonin and or dopamine.</p>
<p>So gut microbiome provides kind of a foundation</p>
<p>for healthy gut and healthy gut brain access.</p>
<p>So much so that some people report</p>
<p>that when they start eating small bits,</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t require a lot of fermented foods,</p>
<p>that their overall mood is better.</p>
<p>Not unlike the effects of EPA,</p>
<p>although I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s been looked at directly</p>
<p>in the context of clinical depression yet.</p>
<p>And if someone knows of a study,</p>
<p>please mention it in the comments.</p>
<p>That would be terrific.</p>
<p>There are some things that you can do</p>
<p>to really damage your gut microbiome.</p>
<p>And this is where there&rsquo;s a huge misconception</p>
<p>that I want to clear up.</p>
<p>There was a study that was published in Nature,</p>
<p>which is among the three top journals</p>
<p>that we have in science.</p>
<p>You know, Nature, Science, and Cell</p>
<p>are considered the top tops,</p>
<p>but excellent journal that showed</p>
<p>that artificial sweeteners,</p>
<p>but a particular artificial sweetener, which was saccharin,</p>
<p>can disrupt the gut microbiome</p>
<p>in ways that is detrimental</p>
<p>to a number of different health markers,</p>
<p>increasing inflammatory cytokines</p>
<p>and all the other bad things that happen</p>
<p>when the gut microbiome is thrown off kilter.</p>
<p>That study was widely discussed,</p>
<p>but there were a few things that were not mentioned there</p>
<p>that are really important.</p>
<p>That study was about saccharin in particular.</p>
<p>Saccharin is not the most typical</p>
<p>artificial sweetener that&rsquo;s used.</p>
<p>The most typical artificial sweeteners that are used</p>
<p>are things like aspartame, so-called NutraSweet,</p>
<p>or sucralose, or these days stevia.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s monk fruits.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, and please correct me</p>
<p>if anyone knows of any studies.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, the negative effects</p>
<p>of these artificial sweeteners on the gut microbiome</p>
<p>were restricted to saccharin.</p>
<p>Now, there is enough chemical similarity between saccharin</p>
<p>and some of the other ones that I mentioned,</p>
<p>but not all of them.</p>
<p>For instance, stevia, monk fruit,</p>
<p>are distinct in their chemical makeup</p>
<p>so that they probably don&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>if they have any, have lower effects,</p>
<p>negative effects on the gut microbiome,</p>
<p>but it should still be tested.</p>
<p>So saccharin is really,</p>
<p>it was shown in this study and several other studies,</p>
<p>can really negatively impact, excuse me,</p>
<p>the quality of the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the narrative around artificial sweeteners</p>
<p>and gut microbiome is incorrect.</p>
<p>Most people thought, oh, saccharin is bad for the microbiome.</p>
<p>It must kill the microbiome.</p>
<p>And so you hear people saying, oh, you know,</p>
<p>artificial sweeteners kill the microbiome.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not true at all.</p>
<p>In fact, in that very same study published in Nature,</p>
<p>they showed that the negative effects of saccharin</p>
<p>on the microbiome could be blocked or eliminated</p>
<p>by giving antibiotics.</p>
<p>So what happens is certain artificial sweeteners,</p>
<p>in particular saccharin, disrupt the microbiome</p>
<p>and make the environment within the gut,</p>
<p>that mucosal lining, more favorable to bacteria microbiota</p>
<p>that are not good for the organism, okay?</p>
<p>This is an important distinction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just that a language thing where people say,</p>
<p>oh, you know, it kills the microbiome.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t kill the microbiome.</p>
<p>It shifts the microbiome.</p>
<p>And shifts in the microbiome can be good</p>
<p>or they can be bad.</p>
<p>And that takes us to another topic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a bit of a hot button topic,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m willing to go there</p>
<p>because I think it deserves conversation,</p>
<p>which is nowadays there are many examples out there</p>
<p>where people have switched from a kind of standard diet</p>
<p>or even a vegetarian diet or vegan diet to a keto diet.</p>
<p>Now, keto doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to mean</p>
<p>the ingestion of meats, but it can.</p>
<p>And they experience positive effects for themselves.</p>
<p>Not everybody, and I&rsquo;ve talked previously</p>
<p>about some of the kind of the incorrect,</p>
<p>what I believe is incorrect marketing of keto</p>
<p>as it relates to the cosmetic effects</p>
<p>and some of the challenges with sleep that some people have.</p>
<p>But some people love keto and it works great for them.</p>
<p>But the ketogenic diet is interesting</p>
<p>because when one shifts to the ketogenic diet,</p>
<p>there is a shift in the gut microbiome</p>
<p>and some people end up feeling better.</p>
<p>Some people end up feeling worse.</p>
<p>Likewise, some people go from ingesting animal products,</p>
<p>including meat or they&rsquo;re vegetarian and they go to vegan,</p>
<p>and they experience positive shifts in mood and affect.</p>
<p>And we know that the transition to a more plant-based diet</p>
<p>and especially the enrichment of fiber</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s present in those diets</p>
<p>also creates dramatic shifts in the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>Some people feel better doing that.</p>
<p>Some people feel worse.</p>
<p>And of course, it&rsquo;s going to depend on whether or not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re ingesting a lot of processed foods or not.</p>
<p>There was a paper published in Cell,</p>
<p>a Cell Press Journal, obviously, excellent journal,</p>
<p>showing that ingestion of processed foods,</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not they come from animal sources</p>
<p>or non-animal sources,</p>
<p>the processed foods themselves tend to create activity</p>
<p>within the body.</p>
<p>And this surely has roots in the nervous system</p>
<p>that lead to overconsumption of calories and weight gain,</p>
<p>even some weight gain that couldn&rsquo;t be explained</p>
<p>by increased calories.</p>
<p>In other words, processed foods are bad</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about animal products or non-animal products.</p>
<p>Probably not surprising now,</p>
<p>given what you know about these sugar-sensing</p>
<p>and other amino acid-sensing cells in the gut</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>So the point of all this is that when I say</p>
<p>you have to find what&rsquo;s right for you,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a throwaway statement.</p>
<p>Some people&rsquo;s microbiome and the lining of their mucosa,</p>
<p>excuse me, their mucosal lining of their throat,</p>
<p>of their gut, of their nose,</p>
<p>everything is improved by diets that are heavily meat-based</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t have many plants.</p>
<p>Other people do much better on a plant-based diet</p>
<p>without many meat products or animal products.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s highly individual.</p>
<p>And this probably has roots in genetic makeup.</p>
<p>This probably has roots in what people were raised on.</p>
<p>Because remember, the nervous system, of course,</p>
<p>is set up by your genes, your genetic program,</p>
<p>but your nervous system, it adapts early in life</p>
<p>to your conditions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s for.</p>
<p>The reason you have a nervous system</p>
<p>is to move your body appropriately</p>
<p>towards things that are good for you</p>
<p>and away from things that are not.</p>
<p>But also, it was designed to adapt.</p>
<p>The early life period has this incredible thing</p>
<p>about plasticity that we spent a whole month on</p>
<p>so that it can change so that, yes, indeed,</p>
<p>some people may like certain foods</p>
<p>and react to certain foods better than others</p>
<p>because of the way that their nervous system was wired,</p>
<p>this enteric, as it&rsquo;s called, nervous system</p>
<p>that lines the gut and that communicates with the brain.</p>
<p>So most of what I&rsquo;ve talked about today</p>
<p>is black and white.</p>
<p>These are things that are present in all of us,</p>
<p>the sugar-sensing neurons of the gut,</p>
<p>the way the vagus is wired,</p>
<p>the fact that omega-3, omega-6 tend to improve,</p>
<p>the ratios tend to impact mood</p>
<p>with high omega-3, omega-6 ratios improving mood.</p>
<p>We talked about all sorts of things</p>
<p>in the gut-brain and body-brain axis.</p>
<p>But when it comes to the microbiome,</p>
<p>the key thing is that we all have a microbiome.</p>
<p>You want a microbiome,</p>
<p>but you want to promote the microbiome</p>
<p>that is right for you.</p>
<p>And that can be shifted and steered</p>
<p>by ingesting certain categories of foods and not others.</p>
<p>And one thing that really frustrates me</p>
<p>is when the people show up with an agenda</p>
<p>like all-meat agenda or a vegan agenda or a keto agenda,</p>
<p>and they talk about these positive effects</p>
<p>on the gut microbiome, and it&rsquo;s all true, frankly.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s highly individual.</p>
<p>Now, this doesn&rsquo;t get to any of the ethical issues</p>
<p>around animals or the planet</p>
<p>and you hear rabid debates about that on both sides.</p>
<p>And I am not qualified or equipped to talk about</p>
<p>whether or not regenerative agriculture</p>
<p>or animal products or farming or any of these things,</p>
<p>how those actually impact the environment.</p>
<p>That is not my expertise.</p>
<p>But when it comes to your health and your microbiome,</p>
<p>you want to support the microbiome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very clear that these fermented foods</p>
<p>support the microbiome,</p>
<p>that we should be ingesting at least two servings per day,</p>
<p>which is quite a lot.</p>
<p>That supplementation at low levels can be good.</p>
<p>Supplementation at high levels can create this brain fog,</p>
<p>even though some people say that result is controversial.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve experienced this myself</p>
<p>and the data look to me pretty darn solid.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one thing to think about as well.</p>
<p>And the other thing about the gut microbiome</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s highly contextual</p>
<p>based on other things that you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So even things like exercise and social wellbeing</p>
<p>and connection,</p>
<p>those things are also impacting the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>So find the diet that&rsquo;s right for you</p>
<p>and that works for you in the context of the other ethical</p>
<p>and lifestyle choices that are important to you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my advice.</p>
<p>A note about fasting.</p>
<p>I have a colleague at Yale</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s an expert in the gut microbiome</p>
<p>and he told me something really interesting,</p>
<p>which is when we fast,</p>
<p>we actually digest certain components</p>
<p>within our dietary tract.</p>
<p>It actually depletes a good amount of the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>And this is interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had good results from,</p>
<p>I guess you would call it intermittent</p>
<p>or kind of circadian type fasting</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;ve never done long fast,</p>
<p>but where I push out my first meal by a few hours.</p>
<p>My first meal is generally around lunchtime or so.</p>
<p>But the longer periods of fasting</p>
<p>that go for a day or two or three days</p>
<p>are known to deplete the gut microbiome in major ways.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not always necessarily a bad thing</p>
<p>because when it&rsquo;s replenished,</p>
<p>it often is replenished at levels</p>
<p>that exceeded its previous level.</p>
<p>But I think that some of the GI tract</p>
<p>and even some of the mental effects</p>
<p>of returning to eating after feeding,</p>
<p>sometimes people don&rsquo;t feel so good when they start eating,</p>
<p>they really want food, but then they start eating again,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t feel as good as they did on the fast.</p>
<p>Some of that may be related to the depletion</p>
<p>of the microbiome that occurs during long fast.</p>
<p>So again, this is something to think about</p>
<p>and talk about with your doctor.</p>
<p>But the idea that fasting across the board is good,</p>
<p>there may be some merits to that,</p>
<p>and certainly in some cases,</p>
<p>but it does deplete the microbiome.</p>
<p>And that depletion of the microbiome is significant</p>
<p>because it means when you return to eating,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually not in the same position</p>
<p>to digest and assimilate those foods.</p>
<p>And those foods are not in the same position</p>
<p>to impact your brain and body</p>
<p>the same way they were prior to the fast.</p>
<p>And this is, I think, why people suggest</p>
<p>a kind of gradual transition back</p>
<p>to consuming nutrients after a fast.</p>
<p>So as we round up, I want to share some results with you</p>
<p>that without question will impact the way</p>
<p>that you respond to food mentally and even physically.</p>
<p>And I know that because that&rsquo;s the central theme</p>
<p>of the studies I&rsquo;m about to tell you about.</p>
<p>I have a colleague at Stanford, Aaliyah Crum,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s done some remarkable experiments on mindset.</p>
<p>And some people could think about these</p>
<p>as placebo effects or belief effects,</p>
<p>but they actually go way beyond those terms.</p>
<p>And there are a number of different examples of this</p>
<p>that Aaliyah&rsquo;s lab and her coworkers have demonstrated,</p>
<p>but two that are particularly interesting to me,</p>
<p>I want to share with you now,</p>
<p>because they really emphasize how our beliefs</p>
<p>can really impact the way</p>
<p>that our brain and body work together.</p>
<p>I think the most famous of these is an experiment they did</p>
<p>where they had two groups of individuals,</p>
<p>they were each given a milkshake,</p>
<p>and they had some factors measured from their blood</p>
<p>by an IV while they ingested the milkshake</p>
<p>and then afterwards as well.</p>
<p>And one of the factors that they were looking at</p>
<p>was something called ghrelin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N.</p>
<p>Ghrelin is a peptide that increases with hunger.</p>
<p>So the longer you haven&rsquo;t eaten, the ghrelin goes up.</p>
<p>And I know some of you say, well, I fast, I fast, I fast,</p>
<p>and I eventually lose my appetite.</p>
<p>Well, ghrelin still goes up and then it drops.</p>
<p>So if you were one of these people</p>
<p>that eats every three hours regularly,</p>
<p>ghrelin kind of gets a little pulse</p>
<p>as you get to that two hour and 50 minute mark.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a little bit of a timer as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really interesting peptide.</p>
<p>In any event, what they did is they gave people milkshakes,</p>
<p>two groups, one group got a shake</p>
<p>that they were told was a low calorie, healthy shake.</p>
<p>The other group got a milkshake</p>
<p>that they were told was the very decadent high calorie shake</p>
<p>I think it was something like two</p>
<p>or maybe even two and a half times</p>
<p>as many calories as the other, perhaps even more.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recall the details,</p>
<p>but you had a high calorie and a low calorie condition.</p>
<p>And then they drank the shake</p>
<p>and then they measured ghrelin in these subjects&rsquo; blood.</p>
<p>And what they found was that the high calorie shake</p>
<p>had a much more robust effect on blunting ghrelin</p>
<p>and reducing ghrelin.</p>
<p>But the interesting thing you probably guessed already</p>
<p>is that it was the exact same shake given to both groups.</p>
<p>So people&rsquo;s belief about the content of something</p>
<p>impacted their physiology.</p>
<p>And this speaks to these so-called top-down mechanisms</p>
<p>or modulation of our physiology.</p>
<p>The previous episode about pain,</p>
<p>we talked about the effects of obsessive,</p>
<p>believe it or not, it was kind of obsessive infatuation</p>
<p>and love on pain responses and pain thresholds.</p>
<p>This is yet another example where beliefs</p>
<p>or subjective feelings can impact physiology</p>
<p>at the level of the periphery</p>
<p>because ghrelin is released in the periphery in the body.</p>
<p>Now, these belief effects extend beyond examples like this.</p>
<p>Another good example that I&rsquo;d like to share</p>
<p>is Allie, Dr. Crumb, and her colleagues did an experiment</p>
<p>where they took housekeepers, hotel,</p>
<p>they were essentially hotel workers,</p>
<p>divide them into two groups.</p>
<p>They had them watch a short film.</p>
<p>In one case, the film was about how their work was important,</p>
<p>it helped people feel comfortable in the hotel,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>The other group heard that the activity</p>
<p>that they were doing, cleaning and taking care of the hotel</p>
<p>was good for them, it was good for their health,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>They controlled very nicely in the study</p>
<p>for health parameters, for individual differences,</p>
<p>and for the behaviors of these people</p>
<p>in the period that followed this short tutorial.</p>
<p>What they found was eight weeks later,</p>
<p>the group that had been told</p>
<p>that the activity was good for them</p>
<p>showed lower blood pressure,</p>
<p>they had lost a significant amount of body fat,</p>
<p>and they reported enjoying their work</p>
<p>far more than the other group.</p>
<p>The same work, simply biased mentally</p>
<p>by the information that they were given,</p>
<p>but their physiology followed that information.</p>
<p>And so this is not just the placebo effect,</p>
<p>this is an incredible set of findings</p>
<p>that illustrate the extent to which</p>
<p>whether or not we believe a food</p>
<p>is going to be good for us or not good for us,</p>
<p>well, we can&rsquo;t escape the reality.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t tell yourself that a poison</p>
<p>is going to be good for you and ingest that poison</p>
<p>and expect it to not kill you,</p>
<p>nor can you tell yourself that eating 12 croissants,</p>
<p>confess I&rsquo;ve done it,</p>
<p>it was after a very long run, a long time ago,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t tell yourself</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s necessarily going to be good for you</p>
<p>or that it&rsquo;s going to make you lose weight.</p>
<p>These belief effects are not about lying to yourself.</p>
<p>In these cases, in these experiments,</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;ll notice,</p>
<p>the subjects didn&rsquo;t have prior knowledge about ghrelin</p>
<p>or about the effects of their daily routine</p>
<p>on weight loss and blood pressure.</p>
<p>So in order for them to work,</p>
<p>you have to be naive to the information, right?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t simply lie to yourself</p>
<p>and tell yourself what you want to believe.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s important,</p>
<p>but also important is that the mind and the body</p>
<p>are in this fascinating interplay.</p>
<p>And today we&rsquo;ve talked mainly about</p>
<p>how the body and things that we put inside this tube,</p>
<p>that runs from our mouth to the other end,</p>
<p>to our rectum basically is impacting all these cells,</p>
<p>these neurons, microbiota in there,</p>
<p>mucosal lining, heart, lungs,</p>
<p>and how all that information is feeding up to the brain</p>
<p>to impact how we feel up here.</p>
<p>But also how we feel up here</p>
<p>is impacting how our body reacts</p>
<p>at levels of very core physiology</p>
<p>that you couldn&rsquo;t just tell yourself</p>
<p>that this was going to work.</p>
<p>But what you believe about certain substances,</p>
<p>certain foods, certain nutrients</p>
<p>does have a profound effect</p>
<p>on the magnitude of their impact.</p>
<p>And sometimes even the quality</p>
<p>and direction of that impact.</p>
<p>Well, first of all,</p>
<p>I want to thank everybody</p>
<p>for their support of this podcast.</p>
<p>The response that we&rsquo;ve received</p>
<p>since releasing at the beginning of the new year</p>
<p>has been tremendous and we&rsquo;re so grateful for it.</p>
<p>I know some of you and people you know have said,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s a lot of information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a college lecture.</p>
<p>Indeed, there&rsquo;s a lot of information,</p>
<p>but I believe very strongly that if you learn mechanism</p>
<p>and maybe even if you hear it several times over,</p>
<p>eventually those mechanisms become embedded</p>
<p>into the way that you view an entire topic.</p>
<p>As well, I always try and put tools as I go along</p>
<p>that you can look to immediately.</p>
<p>Some of them might be right for you.</p>
<p>Others might not.</p>
<p>Try them if you like and don&rsquo;t if you don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>And if they don&rsquo;t work for you, then discard them.</p>
<p>If however, you are finding benefits</p>
<p>from the information and from the tools</p>
<p>and you know others that you think could benefit from it,</p>
<p>please pass along information about the podcast.</p>
<p>Please subscribe to the YouTube channel</p>
<p>if you haven&rsquo;t already.</p>
<p>Please subscribe to us on Apple and Spotify</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s one of the best ways to help support us.</p>
<p>And we do believe in all the products that we support</p>
<p>and our sponsors very much.</p>
<p>Otherwise we wouldn&rsquo;t be working with them.</p>
<p>And as mentioned at the beginning of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>we are now partnered with Momentous Supplements</p>
<p>because they make single ingredient formulations</p>
<p>that are of the absolute highest quality</p>
<p>and they ship international.</p>
<p>If you go to livemomentous.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>you will find many of the supplements</p>
<p>that have been discussed on various episodes</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>and you will find various protocols</p>
<p>related to those supplements.</p>
<p>So today&rsquo;s episode, we took a full journey</p>
<p>into the brain-body relationship</p>
<p>and discussed a lot of the mechanisms</p>
<p>and the actionable items that you can approach</p>
<p>if you want to explore this aspect of your biology</p>
<p>and psychology further.</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least,</p>
<p>I want to thank everybody for your time and attention today.</p>
<p>And as always, thank you for your interest in science.</p>
