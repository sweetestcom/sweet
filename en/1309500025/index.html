<p>if you are new here</p>
<p>every monday i sit down i do my makeup and i talk</p>
<p>about a true</p>
<p>crime case that&rsquo;s been heavy on my noggin</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a good time</p>
<p>kind of i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of sad but if you&rsquo;re interested in true</p>
<p>crime and you like makeup i would</p>
<p>definitely suggest</p>
<p>you hit that subscribe button this week wow</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a doozy</p>
<p>warning the following presentation is intended for</p>
<p>mature audiences</p>
<p>this contains</p>
<p>graphic descriptions</p>
<p>of crime scenes</p>
<p>adult dialogue</p>
<p>and extreme language viewer discretion</p>
<p>is advised so</p>
<p>me personally</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a curious cat meow</p>
<p>three a m one</p>
<p>night and i was laying in bed and i was thinking</p>
<p>where does that fear come</p>
<p>of the windowless</p>
<p>white van you know i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about those</p>
<p>creeper vans when you see him you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a kidnapping van or like a killer van</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m saying like</p>
<p>where did that come from</p>
<p>lawrence bitaker</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>start with him</p>
<p>lawrence bitaker was born in</p>
<p>pittsburgh pennsylvania</p>
<p>on september twenty</p>
<p>seventh nineteen</p>
<p>forty his parents</p>
<p>chose not to have children</p>
<p>so when lawrence was</p>
<p>well when lawrence&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother was pregnant with lawrence</p>
<p>it was a surprise</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t want kids</p>
<p>she made it very</p>
<p>clear when she</p>
<p>found out she</p>
<p>was pregnant it was devastating for her she&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>upset lawrence&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother got pregnant with lawrence and then she gives</p>
<p>birth to him</p>
<p>as one does when lawrence was born</p>
<p>his mother placed him</p>
<p>well and his father</p>
<p>cause they both didn&rsquo;t want kids</p>
<p>they placed him into an orphanage</p>
<p>lawrence did end up getting</p>
<p>adopted when he was just an infant</p>
<p>and lawrence&rsquo;s</p>
<p>adoptive father he worked in the</p>
<p>aviation industry</p>
<p>which required the family to move around the united</p>
<p>states all throughout his</p>
<p>childhood so he really didn&rsquo;t know like what a</p>
<p>stable home</p>
<p>would look like</p>
<p>lawrence at the</p>
<p>age of 12 would have his</p>
<p>first run in with the law</p>
<p>he was arrested for shoplifting and then he</p>
<p>would obtain a</p>
<p>minor criminal record</p>
<p>over the next</p>
<p>four years he</p>
<p>continued to get arrested for</p>
<p>the same offense</p>
<p>petty theft theft</p>
<p>theft in general</p>
<p>lawrence his excuse for these</p>
<p>petty thefts and the thefts that he was committing</p>
<p>had been attempts to compensate for the lack of love</p>
<p>he received from his parents and</p>
<p>that was his reasoning</p>
<p>in 1957 lawrence</p>
<p>and his family they were living in california</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s said that lawrence</p>
<p>had a really high iq but he really struggled in school</p>
<p>and he decided to drop out of high</p>
<p>school within</p>
<p>a year of dropping out of high</p>
<p>school he had been arrested for car theft</p>
<p>and a hit and run</p>
<p>and evading arrest</p>
<p>for these offences</p>
<p>he was imprisoned at the</p>
<p>california youth authority</p>
<p>where he remained</p>
<p>until he was 18</p>
<p>years old once lawrence was released he</p>
<p>went looking for his adoptive</p>
<p>parents and realized</p>
<p>that they had disowned him and relocated to another</p>
<p>state no idea</p>
<p>where they went and sadly he</p>
<p>never saw his</p>
<p>adopted parents</p>
<p>again pop quiz</p>
<p>which previous murder mystery and makeup monday killer</p>
<p>was also staying at the california youth authority a</p>
<p>ed gein b catherine knight c</p>
<p>edmund kemper or d gary hyde nick</p>
<p>time&rsquo;s up i doubt you remember but i knew</p>
<p>it sounded all too familiar high iq</p>
<p>california use authority</p>
<p>hmm it&rsquo;s goddamn</p>
<p>edmund kemper do you remember a boy</p>
<p>i was like what are the odds of that do you remember</p>
<p>edmund kemper</p>
<p>he was a big boy he was like over six feet tall</p>
<p>and anyways i mean suspicious</p>
<p>what are the odds of that so they were</p>
<p>both staying at the</p>
<p>california youth authority at the same time</p>
<p>no reports of them being bffs or anything but</p>
<p>i thought that was a little</p>
<p>odd like what a small</p>
<p>world i guess</p>
<p>anyways so that&rsquo;s a little bit</p>
<p>about lawrence&rsquo;s upbringing</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re gonna talk about roy</p>
<p>norris now two are</p>
<p>gonna become one</p>
<p>but they both have different upbringings okay</p>
<p>so now we&rsquo;re moving on to roy</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t say his name</p>
<p>roy okay look</p>
<p>i have a really hard time with this r situation</p>
<p>so is okay if i call him norris was born in</p>
<p>greenlee colorado</p>
<p>on february 5th 1948 anyways</p>
<p>mr norris here he was conceived out of wedlock</p>
<p>now remember this is 1948 having a baby</p>
<p>out of wedlock was heavily frowned upon</p>
<p>and with that being said his parents decided to</p>
<p>marry because well they felt like that was the</p>
<p>thing they had to do</p>
<p>not a good thing</p>
<p>i know people</p>
<p>still do that now to this day</p>
<p>just remember you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>his father had worked in a</p>
<p>scrapyard and his mother</p>
<p>sadly was a drug addicted housewife</p>
<p>he grew up in his parents home throughout his</p>
<p>childhood and</p>
<p>teenage years</p>
<p>but he was repeatedly placed in</p>
<p>the care of foster families throughout the</p>
<p>state of colorado mr norris</p>
<p>would say his upbringing was</p>
<p>awful his parents were</p>
<p>verbally abusive towards him and would tell</p>
<p>him he was not wanted</p>
<p>and then sadly</p>
<p>the foster families he lives with constantly</p>
<p>would deny roy</p>
<p>food or clothing so there was a period when he was 16</p>
<p>that he was living at home with his parents and i</p>
<p>the family had</p>
<p>visited the home of a lady relative who was in her</p>
<p>early 20s and he began</p>
<p>speaking to her in a very like sexually</p>
<p>suggestive manner</p>
<p>just something that</p>
<p>freaked her</p>
<p>out i&rsquo;m not sure exactly what was said to her but</p>
<p>this is what she had reported</p>
<p>she ordered him to leave the</p>
<p>house and informed</p>
<p>norris mr norris his father</p>
<p>who threatened to subject him to</p>
<p>a pretty hardcore beating</p>
<p>norris here he then</p>
<p>stole his father&rsquo;s car and</p>
<p>drove into the</p>
<p>rocky mountains</p>
<p>where he attempted</p>
<p>to commit suicide by injecting pure air into an artery</p>
<p>in his arm he failed he was</p>
<p>later found by police and</p>
<p>taken in as a runaway</p>
<p>and once he</p>
<p>was returned to his parents his home i mean his dad</p>
<p>beat him pretty badly</p>
<p>and then his parents had informed him that he and his</p>
<p>younger sister were unwanted children</p>
<p>and that they</p>
<p>intended to divorce when both of the kids had reached</p>
<p>a year later norris</p>
<p>dropped out of school and</p>
<p>joined the united</p>
<p>states navy</p>
<p>he was stationed in san</p>
<p>diego in 1965</p>
<p>and then he was deployed to vietnam in 1969</p>
<p>while he was deployed in vietnam</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where he</p>
<p>experimented with different drugs</p>
<p>like heroin</p>
<p>mainly he got</p>
<p>an honorable discharge</p>
<p>from the navy</p>
<p>after one tour of duty</p>
<p>duty so lawrence</p>
<p>was in days of his</p>
<p>parole from the</p>
<p>california youth authority</p>
<p>lawrence was then arrested for</p>
<p>transporting a</p>
<p>stolen vehicle across</p>
<p>state lines</p>
<p>following that he was sentenced to 18</p>
<p>months imprisonment</p>
<p>to be served in oklahoma</p>
<p>state reformatory in 1960</p>
<p>lawrence was released</p>
<p>from prison and soon reverted to to</p>
<p>crime again</p>
<p>because he seems</p>
<p>like he can&rsquo;t stop</p>
<p>within months of being released</p>
<p>he had been arrested in los angeles for robbery</p>
<p>and in may of nineteen</p>
<p>sixty one was</p>
<p>sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment for the robbery</p>
<p>and then after serving</p>
<p>three years lawrence was released</p>
<p>such a joke and then in 1964</p>
<p>he was arrested</p>
<p>again for parole violation</p>
<p>and a year later he was</p>
<p>again released into society between 1967 and 1971</p>
<p>lawrence is arrested a couple of times again</p>
<p>for theft and robbery</p>
<p>he was sentenced to six</p>
<p>months to fifteen years imprisonment</p>
<p>but was released</p>
<p>after serving</p>
<p>just three years</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve caught on but lawrence</p>
<p>got a pretty lengthy record already</p>
<p>and then in nineteen seventy four</p>
<p>look i&rsquo;m just laughing at how ridiculous this is</p>
<p>in 1974 lawrence</p>
<p>was arrested for assault with attempt to commit murder</p>
<p>you see what happened</p>
<p>he stabbed a young</p>
<p>supermarket employee who had accused him of</p>
<p>stealing the</p>
<p>supermarket employee had seen lawrence</p>
<p>stealing a steak</p>
<p>and he followed lawrence outside into the parking lot</p>
<p>where he calmly</p>
<p>asked lawrence whether he had forgotten to pay</p>
<p>for that stake</p>
<p>he was holding lawrence</p>
<p>stabbed them in the chest</p>
<p>supposedly he like barely missed his</p>
<p>heart but he stabs him in the chest</p>
<p>and then he attempts to flee</p>
<p>and then he was</p>
<p>quickly restrained by two other</p>
<p>supermarket employees</p>
<p>now the employee luckily thank god</p>
<p>had survived the</p>
<p>stabbing lawrence</p>
<p>was convicted</p>
<p>of the lesser charge of assault with a deadly weapon</p>
<p>and he was sent to</p>
<p>california&rsquo;s</p>
<p>men&rsquo;s colony</p>
<p>in san luis obispo</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m getting tongue tied</p>
<p>today so in november of 1969 roy</p>
<p>damn it why can&rsquo;t i be a normal person</p>
<p>mr norris norris</p>
<p>was arrested for his</p>
<p>first known</p>
<p>sexual offense he was</p>
<p>charged with</p>
<p>both rape and assault with attempt to commit</p>
<p>rape february of 1970 norris</p>
<p>attempted to deceive a lone</p>
<p>woman into allowing him to</p>
<p>enter her home</p>
<p>and when the</p>
<p>woman refused he attempted to</p>
<p>break into her</p>
<p>house and the</p>
<p>woman called the police</p>
<p>who then arrested mr norris</p>
<p>and then in may of 1970</p>
<p>norris on bail</p>
<p>for his latest offense</p>
<p>he then went on to attack a lady student he had been</p>
<p>stalking on the grounds of the san</p>
<p>diego state</p>
<p>university campus</p>
<p>norris repeatedly</p>
<p>struck her on the back of her head with the rock</p>
<p>until she slumped to her knees</p>
<p>before he repeatedly</p>
<p>beat her head</p>
<p>against the sidewalk</p>
<p>shortly thereafter norris was</p>
<p>charged with assault with a deadly weapon</p>
<p>he committed to a</p>
<p>total of five years imprisonment</p>
<p>he was classified as</p>
<p>a mentally disordered sex offender</p>
<p>and then and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>laughing because of how</p>
<p>ridiculous this is okay</p>
<p>because in 1975</p>
<p>he was released with five years probation</p>
<p>and he was declared by doctors</p>
<p>as an individual who was of quote</p>
<p>no further danger to</p>
<p>others and quote</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s the kicker</p>
<p>the kicker just</p>
<p>three months</p>
<p>after his release</p>
<p>norris approached a</p>
<p>27 year old</p>
<p>woman walking home from a restaurant in dondo beach</p>
<p>and he offered her a ride on his motorcycle</p>
<p>when she declined</p>
<p>norris parked his</p>
<p>motorcycle and</p>
<p>grabbed the</p>
<p>woman&rsquo;s scarf</p>
<p>twisted it around her neck</p>
<p>dragged her into a nearby bush</p>
<p>where he then proceeded to rape her</p>
<p>now the rape was reported</p>
<p>but they were unable</p>
<p>to find norris</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t find him</p>
<p>he was long gone by the time she reported it however</p>
<p>a month later</p>
<p>the victim was out</p>
<p>she was like living her life and she sees she spots</p>
<p>norris&rsquo;s motorcycle</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like oh shit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s his motorcycle</p>
<p>she writes down his license</p>
<p>plate number</p>
<p>and she immediately gave it to the police</p>
<p>norris was arrested</p>
<p>for the rape</p>
<p>and then one year</p>
<p>later he was</p>
<p>tried and convicted</p>
<p>for this offense</p>
<p>he was then sent to the</p>
<p>california men&rsquo;s colony in san luis</p>
<p>obispo and while incarcerated at the</p>
<p>california men&rsquo;s colony</p>
<p>norris met and befriended lawrence</p>
<p>side note because this pisses me off</p>
<p>now you think this</p>
<p>would be the end of the</p>
<p>story right</p>
<p>because all so much shit has already happened between</p>
<p>these two right you</p>
<p>you think this</p>
<p>would be it</p>
<p>you think that</p>
<p>would be the end of this</p>
<p>story nene i say</p>
<p>lawrence and norris his name is rory</p>
<p>but i can&rsquo;t say it okay</p>
<p>lawrence and norris they&rsquo;re in the same prison together</p>
<p>so they become</p>
<p>you know familiar with one another</p>
<p>lawrence would say</p>
<p>you know they were acquaintances at</p>
<p>first they knew of each</p>
<p>other they saw each</p>
<p>other i mean</p>
<p>lawrence would say that they only began</p>
<p>talking in friendly terms</p>
<p>when norris</p>
<p>taught lawrence</p>
<p>how to make jewelry</p>
<p>while in prison you know</p>
<p>you get like arts and</p>
<p>crafts time</p>
<p>then norris</p>
<p>would say that they became really close</p>
<p>when lawrence</p>
<p>saved him from being attacked by fellow inmates on at</p>
<p>least two occasions</p>
<p>so after that they became</p>
<p>pretty close</p>
<p>and what do</p>
<p>close friends do</p>
<p>they sit around</p>
<p>and gossip with one another and like they tell each</p>
<p>other secrets</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what they did when they became friends they</p>
<p>started to discover that they had</p>
<p>common interests norris also confided in lawrence that</p>
<p>the thing that really turned him on</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like let me tell you let me tell you girl</p>
<p>i think that really turns me on</p>
<p>he loved seeing like the face</p>
<p>of frightened</p>
<p>young women</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>added this was</p>
<p>the primary reason why he had such a lengthy</p>
<p>sexual assault record</p>
<p>which is weird because at this</p>
<p>point when he was arrested</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t have a lengthy</p>
<p>sexual assault record</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s reason to believe that he&rsquo;s hiding</p>
<p>a lot of shit</p>
<p>he did that was just like a side note but like okay</p>
<p>so then lawrence</p>
<p>follows that and tells norris that if you ever raped a</p>
<p>woman he would kill her so</p>
<p>you know he</p>
<p>would not leave a witness to the crime</p>
<p>and like norris was like oh my god wow</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so cool wow you&rsquo;re so cool</p>
<p>now when the two were</p>
<p>alone it said that the pair</p>
<p>often discussed plans to assault and murder</p>
<p>teenage girls once they were freed</p>
<p>you see they shared this fantasy which then</p>
<p>evolved into an elaborate plan to murder one girl</p>
<p>of each teenage year so from 13</p>
<p>all the way to 19</p>
<p>they wanted to</p>
<p>find a girl of</p>
<p>every age between then and murder them set</p>
<p>better goals</p>
<p>the parent vowed to become</p>
<p>reacquainted</p>
<p>once they were released</p>
<p>lawrence was released in</p>
<p>october of 1978 he returned to los angeles where he</p>
<p>found work as a mechanicst</p>
<p>mccannest sorry i&rsquo;m having a hard time talking now he</p>
<p>would earn about a thousand dollars a week</p>
<p>which is like a</p>
<p>great amount of money</p>
<p>especially at this time</p>
<p>but he became</p>
<p>friendly with a</p>
<p>ton of people in his neighborhood and his</p>
<p>place of work</p>
<p>and he earned a</p>
<p>reputation as a</p>
<p>generous and helpful</p>
<p>individual who occasionally donated</p>
<p>money to local charities</p>
<p>um reading about him</p>
<p>he seemed to do a lot of like public service and</p>
<p>donating on his</p>
<p>spare time so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>strange but okay i i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i just thought that was kind of</p>
<p>anyways and then</p>
<p>three months</p>
<p>after lawrence was released</p>
<p>in january of nineteen</p>
<p>seventy nine</p>
<p>norris was released from prison and he</p>
<p>moved into his</p>
<p>mother&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>in redondo beach</p>
<p>she soon found employment as an electrician</p>
<p>in compton shortly</p>
<p>after his release</p>
<p>norris received a letter from</p>
<p>lawrence asking if like he wanted to meet</p>
<p>and then in late february</p>
<p>the pair met at a hotel</p>
<p>and they rekindled</p>
<p>their plan to kidnap and rape girls</p>
<p>they shouldn&rsquo;t have even been released in the</p>
<p>first place but that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>a personal opinion i</p>
<p>guess so in</p>
<p>order for the pair to</p>
<p>successfully</p>
<p>kidnap girls</p>
<p>lawrence decided they</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t need a van</p>
<p>as opposed to like a normal car so the two put their</p>
<p>money together and they purchased a silver 1977 cargo</p>
<p>shut the purchase</p>
<p>in silver 1977</p>
<p>gmc cargo van the vehicle was windowless</p>
<p>on the sides and had a</p>
<p>large passenger side sliding door</p>
<p>and according to lawrence</p>
<p>when viewing this sliding door he realized that he</p>
<p>or norris could</p>
<p>quote pull up to a teenage girl real close</p>
<p>and not have</p>
<p>to open the doors all the way lawrence and norris</p>
<p>would nickname this fan</p>
<p>quote murder mac and</p>
<p>lawrence and norris they</p>
<p>constructed like a bed</p>
<p>in the back of the van</p>
<p>beneath the bed they placed</p>
<p>tools like a toolbox</p>
<p>they also had</p>
<p>clothes in there and then they got</p>
<p>like an ice cooler</p>
<p>thing and they filled it with beer and</p>
<p>soft drinks</p>
<p>they would drive up and down pacific</p>
<p>coast highway they</p>
<p>would drive to the beach</p>
<p>and at this</p>
<p>point they just kind of like where</p>
<p>testing it out</p>
<p>flirting with girls they said</p>
<p>having a good time</p>
<p>so not long</p>
<p>after they decided</p>
<p>that they needed to give this fan a go</p>
<p>they needed to try it</p>
<p>they needed to see</p>
<p>can they get</p>
<p>a victim sadly</p>
<p>they do i don&rsquo;t know the exact</p>
<p>the date when they picked her up but it</p>
<p>it was listed at like almost</p>
<p>eight o&rsquo;clock at night</p>
<p>norris had spotted a sixteen year old girl</p>
<p>um she was just walking</p>
<p>alone on the road</p>
<p>this girl&rsquo;s name was lucinda</p>
<p>and she was walking because she had just left</p>
<p>like a church meeting in redondo beach</p>
<p>she was walking down</p>
<p>side street</p>
<p>walking home lawrence remembers</p>
<p>norris saying</p>
<p>quote there&rsquo;s a cute little blonde</p>
<p>so they kind of pull up next to</p>
<p>lucinda and they ask her</p>
<p>hey like do you want do you want a ride</p>
<p>we see that you&rsquo;re walking it&rsquo;s getting late</p>
<p>we can give you a ride</p>
<p>and lucinda declines</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like hell no</p>
<p>so then they offer her weed and beer</p>
<p>because they had that in</p>
<p>their car and she says no</p>
<p>so this kind of pisses them off they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t working</p>
<p>they pull up further down the road</p>
<p>and they park</p>
<p>alongside a driveway</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re waiting</p>
<p>because they see lucinda</p>
<p>like walking in that direction norris then he exits</p>
<p>the van and he opens the side</p>
<p>sliding door</p>
<p>and he pretends to like work in the van he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>sticking out and pretending to kind of</p>
<p>shuffle through things</p>
<p>but really they were just waiting</p>
<p>for lucinda to come walking up as soon as lucinda</p>
<p>walks in their direction up towards the van</p>
<p>norris says like</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know what he says to her he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>says a few words to her</p>
<p>but then he drags her into the van</p>
<p>and then slams the door shut</p>
<p>and he turns the</p>
<p>radio up to like full volume</p>
<p>to muffle any</p>
<p>sounds so norris is in the back</p>
<p>and he is bounding</p>
<p>lucinda&rsquo;s arms and legs and then gags her with</p>
<p>duct tape as lawrence</p>
<p>drove to a road in the san</p>
<p>gabriel mountains</p>
<p>now it said when lucinda was first like</p>
<p>snatched she</p>
<p>was screaming as any of us</p>
<p>would she was</p>
<p>screaming but then she</p>
<p>quickly regained</p>
<p>composure lawrence</p>
<p>wrote that lucinda</p>
<p>displayed a magnificent</p>
<p>state of self control</p>
<p>and composed acceptance</p>
<p>of the conditions of</p>
<p>which she had no control</p>
<p>she shed no tears offered no resistance</p>
<p>and expressed no</p>
<p>great concern for her safety</p>
<p>i guess she knew what was coming</p>
<p>that was a quote</p>
<p>end quote so once i get to this road norris</p>
<p>first was the one to rape lucinda</p>
<p>after instructing</p>
<p>lawrence to</p>
<p>go take a walk and return</p>
<p>in one hour</p>
<p>once lawrence returned to the van he then</p>
<p>asked norris to leave</p>
<p>while he raped lucinda so they just took turns</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s hard to know what happened exactly</p>
<p>because norris</p>
<p>and lawrence they have given</p>
<p>different accounts as to</p>
<p>who actually like killed her</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s said that they argued over whether they</p>
<p>should kill her</p>
<p>or if they should release her i</p>
<p>guess norris is the one who</p>
<p>tried to strangle</p>
<p>lucinda first</p>
<p>this is what norris</p>
<p>says there was</p>
<p>like a certain look in her eyes that made him</p>
<p>physically sick so he is trying to kill her</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s making this</p>
<p>face that like really bothered him</p>
<p>so he said he ran to the</p>
<p>front of the van and he</p>
<p>threw up so then lawrence is like well</p>
<p>get out of my way</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll go do it so he</p>
<p>goes to lucinda</p>
<p>and he strangles her</p>
<p>she collapses to the ground he then</p>
<p>twists a wire coat hanger around her neck</p>
<p>with pliers</p>
<p>and then he wrapped</p>
<p>loosened his body in a plastic shower curtain</p>
<p>and then they both</p>
<p>threw her her body over a</p>
<p>steep canyon that</p>
<p>lawrence had</p>
<p>selected so norris</p>
<p>would say that lawrence</p>
<p>assured him that the animals</p>
<p>would eat her up</p>
<p>so there wouldn&rsquo;t be any evidence left</p>
<p>so then on july 8th 1979</p>
<p>two weeks after the murder of lucinda</p>
<p>lawrence and</p>
<p>norris they encountered an 18 year old andrea joy hall</p>
<p>she was hitchhiking</p>
<p>along the pacific</p>
<p>coast highway</p>
<p>now they see</p>
<p>her but they were kind of like behind another car so</p>
<p>they have full plans to pull over and pick her up but</p>
<p>the car in front of them pulls over and they offered</p>
<p>andrea a ride and she accepted</p>
<p>so she gets in this car that&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>front of them and they drive off</p>
<p>so this pisses</p>
<p>lawrence and</p>
<p>norris off so they decide to just follow the vehicle</p>
<p>from a distance until</p>
<p>andrea had exited the</p>
<p>vehicle in redondo beach</p>
<p>they pull over when andrea had gotten out of the car</p>
<p>and they offer</p>
<p>her a soda or a beer</p>
<p>and she said okay</p>
<p>she opens up the back of the van</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when norris</p>
<p>pounced on her it&rsquo;s said that andrea</p>
<p>really tried to</p>
<p>fight back she</p>
<p>tried her best but</p>
<p>norris was able to like</p>
<p>twist her arm behind her back</p>
<p>which then caused her to</p>
<p>scream in pain</p>
<p>norris then gagged her</p>
<p>with adhesive tape</p>
<p>and then bound her</p>
<p>wrist and her</p>
<p>ankles lawrence and norris drove to</p>
<p>the location in the sand</p>
<p>gabriel mountains</p>
<p>where they had</p>
<p>taken lucinda</p>
<p>sadly andrea when</p>
<p>they arrived there</p>
<p>she was raped</p>
<p>twice by lawrence</p>
<p>and then norris only raped her once</p>
<p>lawrence then forced andrea to walk uphill naked</p>
<p>alongside the road</p>
<p>and then to</p>
<p>perform oral sex on him before</p>
<p>ordering andrea to</p>
<p>pose for several</p>
<p>polaroid pictures</p>
<p>and norris decided to walk to a</p>
<p>local gas station or something and to go buy alcohol</p>
<p>and then when he returned lawrence</p>
<p>was already</p>
<p>alone and he had</p>
<p>two more polaroid</p>
<p>pictures that he had</p>
<p>taken norris</p>
<p>would say that it was just</p>
<p>pictures of her face</p>
<p>being described as sheer tear</p>
<p>but norris didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where lawrence</p>
<p>had put her body or like what happened exactly</p>
<p>lawrence had informed</p>
<p>norris that he had</p>
<p>told andrea he was</p>
<p>going to kill her</p>
<p>and challenged her to give him as many reasons as he</p>
<p>could as she</p>
<p>could to come up with</p>
<p>as to why she</p>
<p>should be allowed to live before</p>
<p>sorry for this one</p>
<p>before thrusting</p>
<p>an ice pick through her ear</p>
<p>into her brain</p>
<p>and he did this to each ear</p>
<p>lawrence then strangled her</p>
<p>before throwing her body off of a cliff</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like no words for how disgusting</p>
<p>these guys are</p>
<p>so then on september 3rd</p>
<p>lawrence and norris</p>
<p>they see two</p>
<p>other girls</p>
<p>who are named</p>
<p>jackie and jacqueline</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re sitting on like a bus stop</p>
<p>bench located</p>
<p>close to hermosa beach</p>
<p>lawrence had</p>
<p>offered the girls a ride they said sure you know</p>
<p>once they were in the van</p>
<p>norris had offered them marijuana</p>
<p>which the girls accepted</p>
<p>before anyone</p>
<p>thinks marijuana is bad</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s not what i&rsquo;m trying to point out</p>
<p>they had it because they knew like it would</p>
<p>bring people into the van</p>
<p>i just know people are</p>
<p>gonna be like marijuana is not why they did this</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not saying</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;m just saying that they had the marijuana okay</p>
<p>shortly after the girls had</p>
<p>entered the van</p>
<p>both of them had noticed lawrence</p>
<p>who was driving the van</p>
<p>he had steered the van</p>
<p>off of the pacific</p>
<p>coast highway</p>
<p>and he was driving</p>
<p>in the direction of the san gabriel mountains</p>
<p>so jacqueline</p>
<p>who was only</p>
<p>13 years old</p>
<p>she attempted</p>
<p>to open up the van door the sliding door because</p>
<p>she just had that gut feeling that this isn&rsquo;t good</p>
<p>while she&rsquo;s trying to get up and like open the sliding</p>
<p>door norris hit her in the back of the head with a bag</p>
<p>that was filled with lead weights</p>
<p>so he knocks her</p>
<p>unconscious jackie</p>
<p>who is 15 the</p>
<p>other girl in this car</p>
<p>she sees what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on obviously</p>
<p>freaks out and she</p>
<p>tries to like run out of the van as well</p>
<p>and then norris is able to like</p>
<p>tackle her and hold her down</p>
<p>so then he tries to</p>
<p>bind and gag jackie</p>
<p>but at the same time</p>
<p>jacqueline the</p>
<p>other girl who is knocked</p>
<p>unconscious she regains consciousness</p>
<p>and again she</p>
<p>tries to open up the van door and flee</p>
<p>which she does</p>
<p>she is able</p>
<p>to get out like the couple steps out of the van</p>
<p>but norris is on it and he grabs her he</p>
<p>twists her arm behind her back</p>
<p>drags her back into the van</p>
<p>and the struggle just continues</p>
<p>so lawrence</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s driving the car sees like the struggle happening</p>
<p>and he pulls the van over he gets out of the van he</p>
<p>punches fucking jacqueline</p>
<p>in the face</p>
<p>and then he assists norris</p>
<p>binding and gagging the two girls they then</p>
<p>drive up to the san gabriel mountains</p>
<p>where they had</p>
<p>taken the other previous girls they</p>
<p>end up staying up there for almost</p>
<p>two days they pretty much her just holding the girls</p>
<p>up there and throughout the two days</p>
<p>they are raping the poor girls</p>
<p>and then physically just</p>
<p>abusing them as well</p>
<p>both men end up</p>
<p>sleeping in the van</p>
<p>alongside both of the</p>
<p>victims or the hostages</p>
<p>with each of</p>
<p>them taking turns working as like a lookout laurens</p>
<p>then walk jacqueline</p>
<p>like onto a nearby hill</p>
<p>and he forces her to</p>
<p>pose for pornographic image</p>
<p>like pictures with his polaroid</p>
<p>before returning her</p>
<p>to the van lawrence also</p>
<p>asked norris to take several polaroid</p>
<p>pictures of himself</p>
<p>and jackie both nude and closed</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s later said that they think</p>
<p>he kind of forces</p>
<p>norris to take</p>
<p>these polaroid</p>
<p>pictures just in case they ever get caught he can also</p>
<p>blame norris</p>
<p>cause so far all the</p>
<p>pictures were just of</p>
<p>lawrence so in the first of</p>
<p>three instances in which</p>
<p>lawrence raped jackie</p>
<p>he also created a tape recording of himself</p>
<p>raping her forcing</p>
<p>them to pretend that she was his cousin</p>
<p>and just recorded it on his tape recording</p>
<p>the tape recording itself</p>
<p>of jackie and her</p>
<p>abuse it was</p>
<p>never found and then</p>
<p>after almost two days of</p>
<p>being held hostage</p>
<p>jackie and jacqueline</p>
<p>were murdered jacqueline was</p>
<p>struck in each ear with an ice pick</p>
<p>and then she was</p>
<p>sadly the whole</p>
<p>thing is sad</p>
<p>ice pick is sad</p>
<p>she was then strangled to</p>
<p>death and then he forced jacqueline</p>
<p>out of the van</p>
<p>upon exiting the sliding door norris</p>
<p>struck her on the head with a</p>
<p>sledgehammer</p>
<p>lawrence then strangled jacqueline</p>
<p>until he believed she had died</p>
<p>and then jacqueline</p>
<p>ends up opening her eyes</p>
<p>which freaks norris out so he grabs his</p>
<p>sledgehammer and just beats her</p>
<p>pretty he just beats beats her and then</p>
<p>he strangles her to death</p>
<p>the bodies of jackie and jacqueline</p>
<p>were thrown over an embankment into the hills</p>
<p>so then lawrence and norris they abduct</p>
<p>their final victim</p>
<p>who was 16 year old shirley</p>
<p>on october 31st 1979</p>
<p>shirley was abducted as she</p>
<p>stood outside of a gas station</p>
<p>and she was hitchhiking home</p>
<p>from a halloween</p>
<p>party it&rsquo;s believed that shirley accepted the ride home</p>
<p>from lawrence and norris because she recognized</p>
<p>lawrence you see shirley worked as</p>
<p>a waitress at a restaurant</p>
<p>and lawrence</p>
<p>would come in there all the time and so she accepted</p>
<p>this ride because she was like oh hey yeah i know him</p>
<p>once inside of the van</p>
<p>again they offer shirley marijuana she refused</p>
<p>so then lawrence</p>
<p>drove the van to a secluded</p>
<p>street where norris</p>
<p>drew a knife</p>
<p>then bound and gagged shirley</p>
<p>lawrence then traded norris</p>
<p>places so norris</p>
<p>then just kind of</p>
<p>drives around aimlessly</p>
<p>while lawrence</p>
<p>is in the back with shirley</p>
<p>lawrence decided to</p>
<p>remove the tape that was holding</p>
<p>shirley you know down and whatnot he proceeded to</p>
<p>torment poor shirley i mean he did with all of them</p>
<p>but it seems like with shirley he upped it up</p>
<p>a notch put on his like tape recorder so he</p>
<p>could record the</p>
<p>whole thing</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s slapping shirley</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s mocking her when she&rsquo;s crying</p>
<p>beating her</p>
<p>over and over</p>
<p>again with his fists and he</p>
<p>is repeatedly</p>
<p>shouting this is according to like detectives and</p>
<p>stuff who heard</p>
<p>the voice recording</p>
<p>shouting at her to</p>
<p>quote say something say something</p>
<p>while he&rsquo;s beating and slapping her</p>
<p>i guess you can hear</p>
<p>shirley screaming and</p>
<p>shouting and crying lawrence is</p>
<p>shouting for her to quote</p>
<p>scream louder</p>
<p>so then lawrence</p>
<p>continues screaming at her to</p>
<p>scream louder and you just hear</p>
<p>shirley screaming</p>
<p>as any of us fucking would</p>
<p>you know like shit</p>
<p>and then he grabs his</p>
<p>pliers out of a toolbox that he had</p>
<p>in the car he then proceeds to rape her and sodomize</p>
<p>her with the pliers</p>
<p>what the this takes a certain</p>
<p>level of sick</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t describe</p>
<p>this you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it said that it was lawrence&rsquo;s idea to turn on the</p>
<p>voice recorder</p>
<p>when detectives are listening to the</p>
<p>voice recorder they hear like that lawrence is</p>
<p>going through the toolbox</p>
<p>i mean you just hear him like</p>
<p>shuffling through</p>
<p>it or you hear him like pulling out different</p>
<p>tools and whatnot</p>
<p>kind of mumbling</p>
<p>and you hear her pleading with him begging</p>
<p>for him to just let her go</p>
<p>so then norris is the one who reaches for the</p>
<p>sledgehammer he then proceeds to</p>
<p>strike shirley</p>
<p>25 consecutive times</p>
<p>norris ends up killing shirley</p>
<p>by strangling her with a wire coat hanger</p>
<p>which he tightened</p>
<p>with the pliers now</p>
<p>lawrence is the one who comes up with this bright idea</p>
<p>discard her body on a</p>
<p>random lawn</p>
<p>in order to view the reaction from the press</p>
<p>he wanted that</p>
<p>media attention</p>
<p>so the pair had</p>
<p>drove around and then they</p>
<p>randomly just</p>
<p>selected a house</p>
<p>and they discarded</p>
<p>shirley&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>or like on the front lawn</p>
<p>shirley&rsquo;s body was</p>
<p>found the next morning by a jogger</p>
<p>lawrence would say that the recording</p>
<p>that he made</p>
<p>of shirley during her rape and torture</p>
<p>it offered nothing</p>
<p>other than the evidence</p>
<p>of a threesome</p>
<p>adding that towards the end shirley was</p>
<p>screaming for him and norris to kill her</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why they did it</p>
<p>no words in november of 1979</p>
<p>norris he became acquainted</p>
<p>or reacquainted</p>
<p>with a friend named joseph jackson</p>
<p>and joseph jackson</p>
<p>was a dude was incarcerated with norris</p>
<p>and they became friendly and they talked and</p>
<p>stuff norris</p>
<p>had confided in this individual</p>
<p>as to his and lawrence&rsquo;s</p>
<p>murders over the last five months</p>
<p>and he included really</p>
<p>graphic details of the murder of shirley and at this</p>
<p>point when he confided</p>
<p>in this guy</p>
<p>shirley was the only victim whose body had been found</p>
<p>and then norris also told this jackson</p>
<p>guy that in addition to the five murders</p>
<p>he and lawrence had committed</p>
<p>there had been</p>
<p>three additional incidents in</p>
<p>which he and lawrence had abducted</p>
<p>or attempted to abduct</p>
<p>young women</p>
<p>who had either</p>
<p>successfully escaped</p>
<p>their attackers or in one instance</p>
<p>had actually been raped but released</p>
<p>when this guy</p>
<p>heard norris&rsquo;s confession</p>
<p>he went to his attorney</p>
<p>and was like what do i do</p>
<p>but you go to authorities</p>
<p>like what do you mean what do you do</p>
<p>but whatever at</p>
<p>least he went okay</p>
<p>he confided or he consulted with his attorney and asked</p>
<p>him what do i do and his attorney</p>
<p>advised him to go to authorities</p>
<p>so this guy agreed and he and his attorney</p>
<p>went to the lapd a</p>
<p>verdondo beach</p>
<p>detective and his name was</p>
<p>paul was assigned</p>
<p>to investigate jackson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>claims the detective</p>
<p>initially noted that jackson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>statements as to norris&rsquo;s confessions</p>
<p>did match reports on file</p>
<p>several teenage girls who had been reported missing</p>
<p>over the previous five</p>
<p>months in addition</p>
<p>the incident norris had confided to jackson where he</p>
<p>claimed he and lawrence</p>
<p>had sprayed mace</p>
<p>in the face of a woman</p>
<p>and this lady</p>
<p>she had been</p>
<p>dragged into the van</p>
<p>and then raped by both men and this lady had</p>
<p>matched a report that was filed</p>
<p>in relation to an incident</p>
<p>which occurred on september 30th</p>
<p>and in this file report a</p>
<p>young woman</p>
<p>named robin</p>
<p>robin said that she had mace</p>
<p>sprayed in her face before being</p>
<p>dragged into a van</p>
<p>and then raped by two caucasian men</p>
<p>in their mid 30s</p>
<p>and then she luckily</p>
<p>was released we don&rsquo;t know why but she was</p>
<p>thank god for her you know like lucky</p>
<p>this robin lady</p>
<p>she did report the abduction and the rape to police</p>
<p>but they had been unable to</p>
<p>identify the two men that she had mentioned</p>
<p>but this jackson guy who had been talking to norris</p>
<p>norris told this jackson guy</p>
<p>about the robin girl</p>
<p>so they were like okay if this</p>
<p>robin girl can</p>
<p>say that norris</p>
<p>is the one that got her and whatever like</p>
<p>identify them</p>
<p>then we could have like a lead or whatever</p>
<p>right so investigators go out to</p>
<p>robin who is now living in</p>
<p>organ and they show her a</p>
<p>series of mugshots</p>
<p>without hesitation</p>
<p>robin is able to</p>
<p>identify two</p>
<p>photos presented to her as</p>
<p>those of the men</p>
<p>who had kidnapped and raped her</p>
<p>on september 30th</p>
<p>norris and lawrence</p>
<p>so once they got this positive id</p>
<p>police place</p>
<p>norris i almost said roy roy</p>
<p>his name is roy</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re calling him norris remember</p>
<p>under surveillance okay so he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>under surveillance</p>
<p>and within days of being</p>
<p>under surveillance</p>
<p>they observed</p>
<p>him dealing drugs</p>
<p>on november 20th 1979</p>
<p>norris was arrested by the hermosa</p>
<p>beach police</p>
<p>lease for parole</p>
<p>violation for dealing drugs</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s weird</p>
<p>how they got him</p>
<p>the same day lawrence</p>
<p>he was staying and</p>
<p>living at a burbank</p>
<p>motel he was then arrested</p>
<p>for the rape of</p>
<p>robin now when they brought</p>
<p>in lawrence</p>
<p>and norris they also brought in</p>
<p>robin to again</p>
<p>id them in person</p>
<p>and say like</p>
<p>you know line them up and say yes that&rsquo;s them</p>
<p>then when they</p>
<p>lined them up</p>
<p>robin couldn&rsquo;t one hundred percent</p>
<p>say yes that&rsquo;s them you know i&rsquo;m saying like they</p>
<p>looked a little bit different than the images she saw</p>
<p>earlier so she said i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>sure i&rsquo;m pretty positive but i can&rsquo;t hundred percent</p>
<p>say so police were a little</p>
<p>irritated by this but they</p>
<p>still arrested them because they had violated their</p>
<p>parole lawrence</p>
<p>the one who was at the hotel</p>
<p>he had drugs on him so they got him that way</p>
<p>thank god you know so then</p>
<p>cause there&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>bitch there&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>police search</p>
<p>lawrence&rsquo;s hotel and</p>
<p>while they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>searching they find a</p>
<p>bunch of polaroid</p>
<p>pictures and on</p>
<p>these polaroid</p>
<p>pictures they see andrea and jackie</p>
<p>remember the</p>
<p>previous victims we had talked</p>
<p>about but they find</p>
<p>pictures of them and</p>
<p>both of them had been reported missing so when they see</p>
<p>these pictures they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>bingo got them</p>
<p>and then inside the van</p>
<p>investigators discovered a</p>
<p>sledgehammer a plastic bag</p>
<p>that was filled with lead weights</p>
<p>a book detailing how to locate police</p>
<p>radio frequencies</p>
<p>a jar of vaseline</p>
<p>two necklaces</p>
<p>which were later confirmed to</p>
<p>belonged to two of the</p>
<p>victims and then they</p>
<p>found a tape recording of a</p>
<p>young woman in obvious distress</p>
<p>she was screaming she was pleading for mercy</p>
<p>while being tortured</p>
<p>and sexually abused</p>
<p>sadly the mother of shirley</p>
<p>the last victim we talked</p>
<p>about they played</p>
<p>the voice recording to her mom</p>
<p>and she was able to</p>
<p>identify the voice</p>
<p>on the tape as being that of her</p>
<p>her daughter i mean how</p>
<p>awful to play that tape for her i</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s i mean</p>
<p>yeah they also</p>
<p>found in lawrence&rsquo;s motel</p>
<p>seven bottles of various</p>
<p>acidic materials</p>
<p>and later investigators</p>
<p>would discover</p>
<p>that lawrence</p>
<p>plan to use</p>
<p>these acidic materials upon</p>
<p>their next victim</p>
<p>inside norris&rsquo;s</p>
<p>apartment police discover a bracelet that he had</p>
<p>taken from shirley</p>
<p>also they found</p>
<p>at the homes of both</p>
<p>lawrence and norris</p>
<p>a bunch of polaroid</p>
<p>pictures they were almost five hundred</p>
<p>pictures of different</p>
<p>teenage girls</p>
<p>young women</p>
<p>most of which</p>
<p>had been apparently</p>
<p>taken at redondo beach</p>
<p>and at burbank high</p>
<p>school he they had</p>
<p>taken pictures of</p>
<p>these girls i guess i</p>
<p>guess potential victims</p>
<p>and most of these</p>
<p>pictures had been</p>
<p>taken without the girls knowledge or consent so then</p>
<p>october 30th 1979</p>
<p>norris attended a hearing</p>
<p>in relation to the september 30th rate by this stage</p>
<p>norris was beginning to display</p>
<p>visible signs of stress you</p>
<p>could tell that he was really over it done he was</p>
<p>cracking you</p>
<p>know norris he waves his miranda rights</p>
<p>before being questioned so</p>
<p>initially norris denies</p>
<p>any involvement</p>
<p>in the murders</p>
<p>rapes or disappearances</p>
<p>of these different</p>
<p>women however when he was confronted with the evidence</p>
<p>investigators had</p>
<p>compiled norris</p>
<p>began to confess</p>
<p>although he did attempt to put more of the</p>
<p>blame on lauren</p>
<p>saying it was him it was</p>
<p>his idea he did all the killing i was just there</p>
<p>but norris did confess to</p>
<p>everything he confessed to</p>
<p>them driving around taking</p>
<p>these girls</p>
<p>to sexually assaulting them to killing them to</p>
<p>throwing over the san gabriel mountains</p>
<p>like he was not holding back</p>
<p>he was telling them everything</p>
<p>strangling them with wire coat hangers</p>
<p>taking an ice pick and driving it into</p>
<p>their ears before being strangled</p>
<p>telling them</p>
<p>everything which is honestly</p>
<p>great you know</p>
<p>because most people</p>
<p>would just fucking lie and they</p>
<p>never get a straight answer</p>
<p>investigators question norris</p>
<p>asked like what were you</p>
<p>gonna do with</p>
<p>those acids we</p>
<p>found and norris</p>
<p>said that they were</p>
<p>intended for use upon the next</p>
<p>they abducted</p>
<p>and the acts of torture that had been committed</p>
<p>and was going to be committed</p>
<p>against their</p>
<p>victims were quote</p>
<p>for fun and</p>
<p>quote all right</p>
<p>you nasties</p>
<p>police investigators they do a</p>
<p>press conference</p>
<p>and they go over</p>
<p>everything that they have</p>
<p>found with these two</p>
<p>guys the sheriff also stated that</p>
<p>police had also</p>
<p>identified 19 of the</p>
<p>women from the</p>
<p>pictures as being</p>
<p>individuals who had been reported missing and not</p>
<p>found and that</p>
<p>these teenage girls and</p>
<p>young women may have been</p>
<p>murdered but they had no evidence to suggest</p>
<p>that these additional 19</p>
<p>women that were</p>
<p>photographed</p>
<p>had been victims of lawrence</p>
<p>and norris and neither did them confess to it which is</p>
<p>norris then</p>
<p>brings detectives to the area</p>
<p>where he and lawrence had disposed of the</p>
<p>victims bodies they did extensive</p>
<p>searches of the areas</p>
<p>where he stated the</p>
<p>bodies of lucinda and andrea had been discarded</p>
<p>but their bodies were never</p>
<p>found on february 9th</p>
<p>1980 the bodies of jaclyn and jackie were</p>
<p>found at the bottom of a canyon</p>
<p>just like norris had described</p>
<p>two detectives</p>
<p>an ice pick was</p>
<p>still lodged in the</p>
<p>skull of jackie</p>
<p>so they knew that</p>
<p>norris&rsquo;s confession and everything was correct</p>
<p>so that in february of 1980</p>
<p>norris and lawrence were formally</p>
<p>charged with the murders of five girls lawrence</p>
<p>was denied bail</p>
<p>whereas norris</p>
<p>he had a bail and it was set at only 10 000</p>
<p>no idea okay norris had accepted a plea bargain in</p>
<p>which he would testify</p>
<p>against lawrence</p>
<p>in return for the prosecution agreeing</p>
<p>not to seek the death penalty</p>
<p>against him which they agreed so</p>
<p>march 18th 1980</p>
<p>norris roy i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry for calling him norris the whole time</p>
<p>but he pleaded guilty to four</p>
<p>counts of first degree murder one</p>
<p>count of second degree murder</p>
<p>two counts of rape and one</p>
<p>count of robbery in may of nineteen eighty</p>
<p>norris was sentenced to forty five years to life</p>
<p>april twenty fourth nineteen eighty</p>
<p>lawrence remember lawrence</p>
<p>his dumbass wasn&rsquo;t saying anything he had a</p>
<p>total of 29 charges of kidnapping rape sodomy</p>
<p>and murder in</p>
<p>addition to various charges of criminal conspiracy</p>
<p>and possession of a firearm</p>
<p>and then when he was</p>
<p>asked how he wanted to plead</p>
<p>lawrence remained</p>
<p>silent he refused to answer</p>
<p>any questions and he refused to say anything so the</p>
<p>judge entered a plea</p>
<p>of not guilty</p>
<p>on his behalf</p>
<p>so then lawrence&rsquo;s</p>
<p>trial had taken</p>
<p>place january 19th of 1981</p>
<p>and of course the star witness</p>
<p>for the prosecution was norris</p>
<p>so norris goes over</p>
<p>everything and says how he became</p>
<p>friends with lawrence</p>
<p>how the both</p>
<p>of them came up with this plan to kidnap rape and kill</p>
<p>teenage girls and then he goes into</p>
<p>great detail</p>
<p>about what he did his own role</p>
<p>norris and then</p>
<p>everything that</p>
<p>lawrence had did</p>
<p>and how lawrence</p>
<p>pressured norris into killing people and then</p>
<p>sadly in court</p>
<p>for lawrence&rsquo;s trial</p>
<p>they played the 17 minute</p>
<p>audio recording</p>
<p>that the pair had made when they were killing shirley</p>
<p>so on this tape there was shirley&rsquo;s</p>
<p>abuse and torment</p>
<p>and rape and</p>
<p>everything and they played it</p>
<p>which a lot of people thought was inappropriate</p>
<p>but they fought hard saying that the</p>
<p>court needs to hear how bad</p>
<p>these guys are</p>
<p>maybe like a</p>
<p>not the whole</p>
<p>seventeen minutes i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>like that would just ruin</p>
<p>that could really</p>
<p>ruin your life you know</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no therapy set up for jury people so</p>
<p>norris said that lawrence</p>
<p>had the audio tape and he</p>
<p>would constantly play it</p>
<p>over and over and over in their van</p>
<p>and that lawrence considered the contents to be</p>
<p>quote real funny</p>
<p>there were more than a hundred people present in this</p>
<p>courtroom and they all</p>
<p>heard that tape</p>
<p>and many members of the jury</p>
<p>cried some people walked out and like left</p>
<p>because it was just too much i don&rsquo;t blame them</p>
<p>it was also noted that lawrence was</p>
<p>laughing and smiling</p>
<p>the entire time the recording was playing so you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a special</p>
<p>place in hell for</p>
<p>these type of people</p>
<p>february nineteenth</p>
<p>nineteen eighty one the jury had deliberated for</p>
<p>three days and they</p>
<p>ended up fine finding lawrence guilty</p>
<p>of five counts of</p>
<p>first degree murder</p>
<p>one charge of conspiracy to commit</p>
<p>first degree murder</p>
<p>five charges of kidnapping</p>
<p>nine charges of rape</p>
<p>one charge of sodomy and</p>
<p>three charges of unlawful</p>
<p>possession of a firearm</p>
<p>lawrence was sentenced to death</p>
<p>for the five</p>
<p>counts of first degree murder</p>
<p>he showed no emotion</p>
<p>as the verdict was delivered</p>
<p>lawrence was formally sentenced to death</p>
<p>and lawrence of course appealed this decision</p>
<p>and then it went all the way to the supreme</p>
<p>court and the supreme</p>
<p>court upheld this</p>
<p>decision that he be</p>
<p>executed a renewed</p>
<p>execution date was</p>
<p>scheduled for july 23 1991</p>
<p>but lawrence once</p>
<p>again appealed the decision of the us supreme</p>
<p>court that he be</p>
<p>executed and he was</p>
<p>granted a further stay</p>
<p>of execution on july 9 1991</p>
<p>as of two thousand nineteen as of</p>
<p>right now you could</p>
<p>could change but lawrence remains incarcerated on</p>
<p>death row at san quentin</p>
<p>state prison</p>
<p>so he hasn&rsquo;t even been killed yet he&rsquo;s still on</p>
<p>death row why does it take so long</p>
<p>like i don&rsquo;t know how i feel</p>
<p>about death row sometimes</p>
<p>but for this</p>
<p>he needs to die yep sorry</p>
<p>people like that need to just</p>
<p>get him out of here</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even deserve to be in prison</p>
<p>get free health care and food and</p>
<p>stuff no nope</p>
<p>and then of course lawrence</p>
<p>was milking it</p>
<p>and he gave several</p>
<p>death row interviews</p>
<p>he loves it</p>
<p>you know so yeah get him out of here</p>
<p>to this date</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s never expressed any remorse</p>
<p>for his crimes he</p>
<p>states the only remorse</p>
<p>he feels is for the fact</p>
<p>that he and norris were arrested and it ruined his life</p>
<p>ruin my life i hate him</p>
<p>he ruined my life roy</p>
<p>norris he remains incarcerated at the donovan</p>
<p>state prison</p>
<p>since his conviction he has repeatedly</p>
<p>claimed the sole reason he participated in the murders</p>
<p>was out of fear</p>
<p>of lawrence</p>
<p>you still fucking did it bro i hate i hate these people</p>
<p>you still did it get the fuck out of here</p>
<p>okay so norris was actually up for</p>
<p>parole in 2009</p>
<p>but he declined to attend the parole</p>
<p>hearing so now he won&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>up for parole for another 10 years</p>
<p>so then in twenty nineteen he was up again like bitch</p>
<p>he came this close to getting out maybe we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>scary but he was denied and he&rsquo;ll be up</p>
<p>again for parole in twenty</p>
<p>twenty nine</p>
<p>so detective paul</p>
<p>now this is the chief investigator of the</p>
<p>murders have committed by</p>
<p>lawrence and norris sadly</p>
<p>he committed suicide in december of nineteen eighty</p>
<p>seven he was only thirty nine years old he</p>
<p>wrote a ten page suicide note he specifically</p>
<p>referred to</p>
<p>the murders committed by lawrence and norris as</p>
<p>haunting him</p>
<p>and he had this fear that they</p>
<p>could be released from prison</p>
<p>you just couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore i</p>
<p>guess which is awful</p>
<p>a lot of people want to know what happened to the</p>
<p>audio tapes</p>
<p>because they want to hear them</p>
<p>like you guys are</p>
<p>sick not you guys but like when i was on the internet</p>
<p>researching this a lot of people were like</p>
<p>where are the tapes i want to hear them it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>no fuck you</p>
<p>sorry i said it</p>
<p>no but the tapes that they made</p>
<p>torturing surely</p>
<p>they remains in</p>
<p>possession of the fbi academy</p>
<p>and they actually use it to train</p>
<p>and desensitize fbi</p>
<p>agents to the raw reality of torture and murder</p>
<p>which is awful</p>
<p>so that is the story of</p>
<p>lawrence and roy</p>
<p>and how shitty they are</p>
<p>oh and i forgot to mention</p>
<p>some people call them the tool box killers</p>
<p>because they had a tool box</p>
<p>not to be confused</p>
<p>with the toy box that we already talked</p>
<p>about remember</p>
<p>both disturbing</p>
<p>both just deserve to die one of them already did</p>
<p>truth or consequences dude is</p>
<p>the toy box dude is dead thank god</p>
<p>this one was exhausting</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s believed</p>
<p>this is where the fear of that</p>
<p>scary like rape van</p>
<p>came into play</p>
<p>that has been</p>
<p>instilled into a lot of our heads for some odd reason</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s believed that this is</p>
<p>where it came from</p>
<p>this took place</p>
<p>you know in the</p>
<p>seventies but</p>
<p>to this day</p>
<p>be safe out there</p>
<p>i feel like whenever i&rsquo;m walking</p>
<p>alone one thing i like to do is yell out loud</p>
<p>i have a weapon</p>
<p>because it lets people</p>
<p>know not to attack me but i feel like that&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>right thing to do</p>
<p>cause i could get arrested</p>
<p>cause that&rsquo;s illegal but like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m always like if it&rsquo;s late at</p>
<p>night and i&rsquo;m walking okay and i hear like</p>
<p>a car coming i&rsquo;m always like i have a fucking knife</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i do</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t recommend that</p>
<p>what if it was a cop</p>
<p>yeah i want to start adding advice</p>
<p>but like i don&rsquo;t know dude it&rsquo;s fucking scary</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t even get me started on the comment section</p>
<p>to like these interviews and</p>
<p>stuff you can look on youtube and i&rsquo;ll link some down</p>
<p>below lawrence or even norris</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re sitting and they&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about what they did</p>
