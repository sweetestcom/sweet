<p>Tim Cook: Good morning. Welcome to WWDC!</p>
<p>And welcome to Apple Park</p>
<p>for this very special day of announcements</p>
<p>about our latest technologies and platforms.</p>
<p>We love to see our amazing developers dream up big ideas</p>
<p>and bring those ideas to life in the incredible apps they create.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s remarkable to think that this year marks the 15th anniversary</p>
<p>of the App Store, which changed everything.</p>
<p>Together with the iPhone,</p>
<p>developers&rsquo; apps have helped create entirely new industries,</p>
<p>enriched the lives of our users, and changed the world.</p>
<p>We are committed to providing developers with resources,</p>
<p>tools, and opportunities to help them do their amazing work.</p>
<p>One of these important resources</p>
<p>is our Worldwide Developers Conference.</p>
<p>We are excited to kick things off with this morning&rsquo;s announcements.</p>
<p>Our teams are continuing to innovate‚Äì</p>
<p>creating breakthrough experiences for our customers.</p>
<p>Driven by the deep integration of hardware, software, and services,</p>
<p>these experiences deliver the magic that comes when using our products.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something only Apple can do.</p>
<p>Today we&rsquo;re going to make some of our biggest announcements ever</p>
<p>at WWDC.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be talking about the future of our incredible software platforms</p>
<p>as well as introducing some exciting new products.</p>
<p>So to get it started, I&rsquo;d like to hand it over to John</p>
<p>to talk about the Mac.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>John Ternus: The Mac has been completely transformed</p>
<p>by the transition to Apple silicon,</p>
<p>with industry-leading performance, new capabilities,</p>
<p>and extraordinary battery life.</p>
<p>Apple silicon has also enabled developers</p>
<p>to take their apps further than ever</p>
<p>and do things that simply weren&rsquo;t possible before.</p>
<p>And its power-efficient performance</p>
<p>enables us to create new systems we could only dream of making in the past,</p>
<p>like the amazing 13-inch MacBook Air with M2.</p>
<p>With its incredible performance, brilliant display,</p>
<p>all-day battery life, and striking design,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s our most loved Mac.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also the world&rsquo;s best-selling laptop.</p>
<p>Well, today, we have even bigger news to share</p>
<p>on another product made possible by Apple silicon.</p>
<p>Here it is‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Dream big ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Whoa ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Dream big ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ I didn&rsquo;t know this could be so ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Easy ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Dream big ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Big ‚ô™</p>
<p>Introducing the 15-inch MacBook Air.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s best 15-inch laptop.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s Kate to tell you all about it.</p>
<p>Kate Bergeron: The new Air has everything you could want</p>
<p>in a 15-inch laptop.</p>
<p>It starts with a design that&rsquo;s astonishingly thin and light,</p>
<p>yet feels incredibly solid and durable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only 11.5 mm thin,</p>
<p>making it the world&rsquo;s thinnest 15-inch laptop.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s easy to carry around at just over three pounds.</p>
<p>It features MagSafe charging, two Thunderbolt ports,</p>
<p>and a headphone jack for versatile connectivity.</p>
<p>And it comes in four gorgeous finishes,</p>
<p>including Midnight and Starlight.</p>
<p>The Air has a brilliant Liquid Retina display,</p>
<p>with an expansive 15.3-inch screen</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s surrounded by thin, 5 mm borders,</p>
<p>so you can see even more of your content.</p>
<p>And with up to 500 nits of brightness</p>
<p>and support for one billion colors,</p>
<p>everything looks remarkably rich and vibrant.</p>
<p>It has a great 1080p camera for video calls</p>
<p>along with a three-mic array</p>
<p>so you come through loud and clear.</p>
<p>And the new Air sounds awesome!</p>
<p>With six speakers, including force-canceling woofers,</p>
<p>it delivers immersive Spatial Audio.</p>
<p>All of this is enabled by the M2 chip,</p>
<p>which delivers amazing performance and battery life.</p>
<p>In fact, the new Air is 12 times faster</p>
<p>than the fastest Intel-based MacBook Air.</p>
<p>And it gets an astonishing 18 hours of battery life.</p>
<p>So what makes the new Air the world&rsquo;s best 15-inch laptop?</p>
<p>Well, 15-inch PC laptops</p>
<p>are full of tradeoffs between performance,</p>
<p>display resolution, battery life, and design.</p>
<p>When compared to the best-selling 15-inch PC laptop</p>
<p>with a Core i7 processor,</p>
<p>MacBook Air is up to twice as fast.</p>
<p>And its display is twice the resolution</p>
<p>and 25% brighter.</p>
<p>Even with better performance and a better display,</p>
<p>you still get up to 50% more battery life than on the PC.</p>
<p>When it comes to design,</p>
<p>the Air is nearly 40% thinner</p>
<p>and half a pound lighter than the PC.</p>
<p>And its fan-less design runs completely silent.</p>
<p>With all these great features in the new Air,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the only 15-inch laptop that has it all.</p>
<p>If this is your first Mac,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll enjoy how easy it is to set up and use.</p>
<p>And once you start using it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see how seamlessly it works with iPhone.</p>
<p>So you can do things like copy something on your phone,</p>
<p>and paste it with your Mac using Universal Clipboard.</p>
<p>Or pick up where you left off on a thread in Messages with Handoff.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the new 15-inch MacBook Air.</p>
<p>It has an expansive display,</p>
<p>the incredible performance of M2,</p>
<p>a six-speaker sound system, and tremendous battery life,</p>
<p>all in the world&rsquo;s thinnest 15-inch laptop.</p>
<p>Now, back to John.</p>
<p>John: We&rsquo;re super excited about the all-new 15-inch MacBook Air,</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s best 15-inch laptop.</p>
<p>And it starts at just $1299!</p>
<p>And $1199 for education.</p>
<p>An incredible value for such an incredible laptop.</p>
<p>You can to order it today,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll be available next week.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also excited that the 13-inch MacBook Air</p>
<p>now starts at $1099‚Äì $100 less than before.</p>
<p>And the 13-inch Air with M1 remains in the lineup at $999.</p>
<p>So customers have more choices than ever</p>
<p>to find the perfect Air for them.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s MacBook Air.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s talk about our pro products.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, we announced M2 Pro and M2 Max,</p>
<p>along with the new MacBook Pro and Mac mini,</p>
<p>and users have been amazed by their performance.</p>
<p>Well, now we have even more exciting news for pros,</p>
<p>starting with Mac Studio.</p>
<p>Introduced last year, Mac Studio is an entirely new product</p>
<p>designed specifically for pros, and it&rsquo;s been a breakthrough.</p>
<p>Users have been astonished by what they can do with it,</p>
<p>and satisfaction is through the roof.</p>
<p>They love that it puts tremendous performance</p>
<p>and extensive connectivity</p>
<p>in a compact form that lives right on their desk.</p>
<p>And you can already find it in the heart</p>
<p>of hundreds of thousands of home and pro studios across the world.</p>
<p>Like at NBC, where they use it to deliver &ldquo;Saturday Night Live&rdquo; every week.</p>
<p>And at Air Studios, where sound engineers use it</p>
<p>to bring blockbuster movies to life.</p>
<p>And at Lux, where software developers rely on it</p>
<p>to create cutting-edge apps, like Halide.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re excited to give Mac Studio its first big update.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s Jennifer to tell you more.</p>
<p>Jennifer Munn: Users love Mac Studio</p>
<p>for its incredible performance and connectivity,</p>
<p>and today, both get even better.</p>
<p>First, Mac Studio is getting the immensely capable M2 Max,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a performance powerhouse.</p>
<p>Developers can build new versions of apps at warp speed,</p>
<p>with up to 25% faster performance than M1 Max.</p>
<p>Motion graphics designers using After Effects</p>
<p>can render up to 50% faster than M1 Max.</p>
<p>Mac Studio with M2 Max is also 4 times faster</p>
<p>than the most powerful Intel-based iMac.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not all.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re adding one final chip to the M2 family,</p>
<p>taking Mac performance to new heights.</p>
<p>Introducing M2 Ultra.</p>
<p>It is a monster of a chip!</p>
<p>Connecting two M2 Max die together</p>
<p>with our groundbreaking UltraFusion architecture,</p>
<p>it doubles the performance of M2 Max.</p>
<p>The 24-core CPU in M2 Ultra</p>
<p>delivers 20% faster performance than M1 Ultra.</p>
<p>And its 76-core GPU is 30% faster than M1 Ultra.</p>
<p>Finally, the 32-core Neural Engine is 40% faster.</p>
<p>And M2 Ultra can support an enormous</p>
<p>192GB of unified memory,</p>
<p>which is 50% more than M1 Ultra,</p>
<p>enabling it to do things other chips just can&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>For example, in a single system, it can train massive ML workloads,</p>
<p>like large transformer models</p>
<p>that the most powerful discrete GPU can&rsquo;t even process</p>
<p>because it runs out of memory.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s M2 Ultra‚Äì our largest and most capable chip ever.</p>
<p>With a mighty CPU and GPU</p>
<p>combined with massive memory bandwidth in a single SoC,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the most powerful chip ever created for a personal computer.</p>
<p>And today, we&rsquo;re bringing M2 Ultra to Mac Studio,</p>
<p>taking performance even further.</p>
<p>Compared to Mac Studio with M1 Ultra,</p>
<p>colorists using DaVinci Resolve</p>
<p>will see up to 50% faster video processing than before.</p>
<p>3D artists using Octane</p>
<p>can now render up to three times faster!</p>
<p>And with M2 Ultra&rsquo;s Media Engine,</p>
<p>video editors can playback a mind-blowing 22 streams</p>
<p>of 8K ProRes video.</p>
<p>No other computer in the world comes close!</p>
<p>Mac Studio with M2 Ultra</p>
<p>is also a whopping six times faster</p>
<p>than the most powerful Intel-based iMac.</p>
<p>M2 Max and M2 Ultra</p>
<p>take Mac Studio performance to a whole new level.</p>
<p>For connectivity, Mac Studio now has higher bandwidth HDMI,</p>
<p>enabling up to 8K resolution</p>
<p>and 240-hertz frame rates.</p>
<p>And with M2 Ultra,</p>
<p>it can support an incredible six Pro Display XDRs,</p>
<p>driving over 100 million pixels!</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the new Mac Studio.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a performance powerhouse</p>
<p>taking demanding workflows to the next level.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not done yet.</p>
<p>There are some pro users who want ultimate performance,</p>
<p>yet depend on internal PCI expansion as well.</p>
<p>Like audio engineers at Skywalker Sound,</p>
<p>who work on feature films</p>
<p>like Oscar winner &ldquo;Top Gun: Maverick,&rdquo;</p>
<p>and artists at Color Collective,</p>
<p>who grade films like Oscar winner</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything Everywhere All At Once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So today, we&rsquo;re bringing Apple silicon</p>
<p>to one more pro product.</p>
<p>Introducing Mac Pro with Apple silicon.</p>
<p>It combines our most powerful chip</p>
<p>with PCI expansion</p>
<p>to tackle the most demanding workflows.</p>
<p>First, every Mac Pro comes with the outrageous performance</p>
<p>of M2 Ultra.</p>
<p>Compared to the fastest Intel-based Mac Pro,</p>
<p>many real-world pro workflows,</p>
<p>like video transcoding and 3D simulation,</p>
<p>are three times faster.</p>
<p>A key reason is the amount of unified memory in M2 Ultra,</p>
<p>which is up to a gigantic 192GB.</p>
<p>It enables the new Mac Pro to do things simply not possible before,</p>
<p>like render Disney&rsquo;s Moana Island scene</p>
<p>with massive geometry and textures.</p>
<p>Another reason is M2 Ultra&rsquo;s Media Engine,</p>
<p>which accelerates video processing.</p>
<p>The Intel-based Mac Pro does this using Afterburner,</p>
<p>a card that can play three streams of 8K ProRes video.</p>
<p>Now, every Mac Pro</p>
<p>has Afterburner performance built in!</p>
<p>And not just one,</p>
<p>but the performance of seven Afterburner cards!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible!</p>
<p>In fact, when using six video I/O cards,</p>
<p>Mac Pro can ingest 24 4K camera feeds</p>
<p>and encode them to ProRes in real time,</p>
<p>all on a single machine.</p>
<p>And the wide array of advanced connectivity on Mac Pro</p>
<p>gets even better with eight built-in Thunderbolt ports‚Äì</p>
<p>six on the back and two on the top‚Äì</p>
<p>which is twice as many as before.</p>
<p>Finally, Mac Pro brings PCI expansion to Apple silicon.</p>
<p>It features six open expansion slots that support gen 4,</p>
<p>which is two times faster than before.</p>
<p>So users can customize Mac Pro with essential cards,</p>
<p>including audio and video I/O, networking, and storage.</p>
<p>Finally, it&rsquo;s available in both tower</p>
<p>and rack mount enclosures.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the new Mac Pro, powered by Apple silicon.</p>
<p>With incredible M2 Ultra performance,</p>
<p>tremendous connectivity,</p>
<p>and the versatility of PCI expansion,</p>
<p>it takes even the most demanding workflows</p>
<p>to a whole new level.</p>
<p>Now, back to John.</p>
<p>John: Today we&rsquo;ve announced not just one,</p>
<p>but the two most powerful Macs we&rsquo;ve ever made.</p>
<p>Mac Studio with M2 Max still starts at $1999,</p>
<p>an incredible value for pro users.</p>
<p>And with huge performance increases from M2 Ultra,</p>
<p>Mac Pro starts at $6999.</p>
<p>You can order both products today,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll be available next week.</p>
<p>They join our other Pro systems to give our users</p>
<p>the most powerful and capable lineup of Pro products</p>
<p>that Apple has ever offered.</p>
<p>This completes the transition to Apple silicon,</p>
<p>which has completely transformed the desktop and laptop experience.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re just getting started.</p>
<p>For Intel-based Mac users, every Mac is now a gigantic upgrade.</p>
<p>And for PC users, there&rsquo;s never been a better time</p>
<p>to switch to a Mac.</p>
<p>Now, back to Tim.</p>
<p>Tim: With Apple silicon,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s remarkable how far we&rsquo;ve taken the Mac</p>
<p>in such a short amount of time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best and most capable lineup</p>
<p>in the history of the personal computer,</p>
<p>and I couldn&rsquo;t be more excited about its future.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the integration of our hardware and software</p>
<p>that brings our amazing products to life.</p>
<p>Our software platforms enable our developers</p>
<p>to do their amazing work,</p>
<p>as well as provide incredible experiences for our users.</p>
<p>So to tell you what&rsquo;s new with our software platforms, here&rsquo;s Craig.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Craig Federighi: Let&rsquo;s start with iOS.</p>
<p>This year, we looked across the entire iPhone experience</p>
<p>to provide delightful new features</p>
<p>that make the things you do on iPhone more personal and intuitive.</p>
<p>Our next release, iOS 17,</p>
<p>delivers more expressive communication,</p>
<p>simplified sharing, more intelligent input,</p>
<p>and all-new experiences for your iPhone.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s begin with some major updates</p>
<p>to three apps that are central</p>
<p>to how you communicate with people every day:</p>
<p>Phone, FaceTime, and Messages.</p>
<p>The Phone app is essential to the iPhone experience.</p>
<p>Some of our most special moments start with a phone call,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re making a big update to the Phone app this year.</p>
<p>First, we&rsquo;re giving you a brand-new way to express yourself</p>
<p>with personalized Contact Posters.</p>
<p>You get to customize exactly how you&rsquo;re represented</p>
<p>when you give people a call.</p>
<p>Contact Posters feature beautiful treatments,</p>
<p>for both photos and Memoji,</p>
<p>paired with eye-catching typography.</p>
<p>And in Chinese and Japanese,</p>
<p>the new layout with vertical text looks incredible.</p>
<p>This rich new visual identity doesn&rsquo;t just show up in calls.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also part of your contact card,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;ll have a consistent look across the places</p>
<p>where you communicate and share.</p>
<p>With Posters, you&rsquo;re in control!</p>
<p>Customizing your Poster works a lot like personalizing your Lock Screen.</p>
<p>Decide on the image, font, and color.</p>
<p>The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>And when calls come your way,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re from your neighbor, your friend, or your boss,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to stand out in a whole new way.</p>
<p>And for developers, this all works with CallKit,</p>
<p>so posters will appear for calls</p>
<p>placed via third-party VoIP apps too.</p>
<p>Next, we have a powerful new feature</p>
<p>to help you make a more informed decision</p>
<p>about when to answer an incoming call:</p>
<p>Live Voicemail.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when a call comes in from an unknown number,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to know whether it&rsquo;s one you want to pick up.</p>
<p>Now, when someone calls you and leaves a message,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see a live transcription in real time as they speak.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s something you want to address right away,</p>
<p>you can pick up the call to talk to them right then and there.</p>
<p>This is great for calls from friends and family too.</p>
<p>Imagine you get a phone call while in a meeting</p>
<p>and want to know whether it&rsquo;s something urgent</p>
<p>or if it can wait until the meeting has wrapped.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see the voicemail right on your screen,</p>
<p>so you can decide whether to step out and take the call.</p>
<p>Thanks to the power of the Neural Engine,</p>
<p>Live Voicemail transcriptions are handled on-device,</p>
<p>preserving your privacy.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s another type of call getting a big update:</p>
<p>FaceTime, where we&rsquo;ve added</p>
<p>one of our most requested communication features.</p>
<p>Now, when you call someone on FaceTime</p>
<p>and they aren&rsquo;t available, you&rsquo;ll be able to leave a message.</p>
<p>So whether you&rsquo;re just calling to say &ldquo;hey,&rdquo;</p>
<p>or want to share a precious moment,</p>
<p>you can record a message so that they can enjoy it later.</p>
<p>Next, to tell you about some updates</p>
<p>to another way we love to share and communicate every day,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s Kim.</p>
<p>Kim Beverett: Messages is the way we stay connected</p>
<p>with the people who matter most.</p>
<p>To start, let&rsquo;s quickly cover some key improvements</p>
<p>that make using Messages even faster and more convenient.</p>
<p>First, search is more powerful</p>
<p>and precise with the addition of search filters.</p>
<p>So now, you can start a search and then add additional terms</p>
<p>to narrow the results to find exactly what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>Next, a new catch-up arrow in the top right of your conversation</p>
<p>lets you jump to the first message you haven&rsquo;t seen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s perfect on busy days when the group chat is blowing up.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also made replying inline faster than ever.</p>
<p>Just swipe to reply on any bubble.</p>
<p>And for those times when you get an audio message</p>
<p>but you aren&rsquo;t able to listen right away,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re now transcribed,</p>
<p>so you can read them in the moment, and listen later.</p>
<p>Finally, location sharing now lets you keep track</p>
<p>of your friend&rsquo;s location directly in the conversation.</p>
<p>Next, I&rsquo;d like to share an important new feature</p>
<p>for those situations where you want to let a loved one know</p>
<p>you made it back home safely: Check In.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re walking home after dark,</p>
<p>or going for an early morning run,</p>
<p>you can start Check In with a family member or friend</p>
<p>to let them know when you get home safely.</p>
<p>As soon as you arrive,</p>
<p>Check In automatically detects that you&rsquo;re home</p>
<p>and lets your friend know.</p>
<p>But if something unexpected were to happen while you&rsquo;re on your way,</p>
<p>it can recognize that you&rsquo;re not making progress</p>
<p>towards your destination and check in with you.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t respond, it can automatically share</p>
<p>useful information, such as your current location and the route you took,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll also be able to see your battery level and cell service status</p>
<p>so they know if you might be able to take their call.</p>
<p>And any information you shared with your friend</p>
<p>is end-to-end encrypted.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s Check In, an easy way to feel reassured</p>
<p>that your loved ones have your back.</p>
<p>We also have an updated design</p>
<p>for how you get to all your iMessage apps.</p>
<p>They used to live above your keyboard</p>
<p>and now, they are gracefully tucked away,</p>
<p>giving your conversations this sleek, new look.</p>
<p>With just a tap of this new plus button,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see all the things you send the most,</p>
<p>like your photos, audio messages, and location.</p>
<p>And when you swipe up, you&rsquo;ll see all your iMessage apps there too.</p>
<p>Also inside this menu is something you are going to love:</p>
<p>a brand-new Stickers experience.</p>
<p>Let me show it to you.</p>
<p>By tapping the plus button</p>
<p>and then tapping Stickers,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see the brand-new drawer</p>
<p>that brings all my stickers into one place,</p>
<p>like my recently used stickers,</p>
<p>Memoji, and any sticker packs I&rsquo;ve downloaded.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve made all Emoji into stickers.</p>
<p>I can peel and stick an Emoji sticker.</p>
<p>And I can rotate and resize it too!</p>
<p>Last year, we introduced the ability to lift a subject</p>
<p>from the background of your photos.</p>
<p>And now, those subjects can be turned into stickers.</p>
<p>By tapping the new Live Stickers tab,</p>
<p>I see all the stickers I&rsquo;ve made with my own photos.</p>
<p>Let me show you how I made these.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tap the plus button.</p>
<p>I can pick any one of these photos and turn it into a sticker.</p>
<p>And check this out.</p>
<p>When I tap on the Live Photos tab,</p>
<p>I see all of the Live Photos</p>
<p>that will make great animated stickers.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we make a sticker out of&hellip;</p>
<p>this one?</p>
<p>And just like that,</p>
<p>it gets added right into my Live Stickers tab.</p>
<p>From there, I can send my sticker inline,</p>
<p>or peel and stick like this.</p>
<p>You can also add effects to Live Stickers.</p>
<p>When you tilt your phone in Messages, they really come to life.</p>
<p>Best of all, you can now react to messages</p>
<p>by adding stickers directly to any bubble</p>
<p>from the Tapback menu.</p>
<p>And the fun doesn&rsquo;t stop in Messages.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve added Stickers system wide,</p>
<p>so you can access your full sticker collection</p>
<p>in Markup and anywhere you can access Emoji today,</p>
<p>including in third-party apps.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s Messages.</p>
<p>Now, back to Craig.</p>
<p>Craig: These updates to Messages, FaceTime, and Phone</p>
<p>will enhance the way we communicate every day.</p>
<p>iPhone provides many ways to share content with others.</p>
<p>And we have some exciting updates</p>
<p>to how we share with AirDrop.</p>
<p>AirDrop makes it easy to share a file with a colleague</p>
<p>or send photos to a friend in seconds.</p>
<p>And this year, we&rsquo;re expanding how you can use AirDrop</p>
<p>to share in all new ways,</p>
<p>starting with how you swap your number with someone new.</p>
<p>Today, you either hand your phone to them,</p>
<p>or one of you dictates your information while the other types it.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a better way:</p>
<p>NameDrop.</p>
<p>With NameDrop, you can just bring your phones close together.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see the same contact poster we talked about for phone calls,</p>
<p>and you can easily choose the phone numbers and email addresses</p>
<p>you want to share along with it</p>
<p>and share them, just like that!</p>
<p>And to make exchanging contacts even more convenient,</p>
<p>you can use NameDrop with an iPhone and an Apple Watch too.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re also using this same gesture</p>
<p>to make it easier than ever to AirDrop content,</p>
<p>and even kick off shared experiences.</p>
<p>When you want to share the stunning photos you took on your latest adventure,</p>
<p>again, just bring your phones close together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that simple.</p>
<p>And for those times when someone is sending over a ton of photos</p>
<p>or a large video file and you need to step away,</p>
<p>you can now leave AirDrop range,</p>
<p>and your content will continue to send securely</p>
<p>in full quality over the Internet.</p>
<p>You can also bring your devices together</p>
<p>to instantly kick off a shared activity</p>
<p>using SharePlay,</p>
<p>like when you&rsquo;re going for a run</p>
<p>and want to share some music to stay on the same beat.</p>
<p>And for developers, this will work automatically</p>
<p>for apps that support SharePlay,</p>
<p>so you can bring your phones together</p>
<p>to watch the same livestream on Twitch</p>
<p>or jump into a coding game together with Imagi.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never been easier to share.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s talk about some enhancements</p>
<p>that will make text input even more intelligent</p>
<p>with the Keyboard and Dictation.</p>
<p>iOS 17 brings big updates to the intelligence in the keyboard</p>
<p>that improve the experience every time you type.</p>
<p>It starts with the feature at the core of typing accurately on iPhone:</p>
<p>Autocorrect.</p>
<p>Autocorrect is powered by on-device machine learning,</p>
<p>and over the years, we&rsquo;ve continued to advance these models.</p>
<p>The keyboard now leverages a Transformer language model,</p>
<p>which is state of the art for word prediction,</p>
<p>making autocorrect more accurate than ever.</p>
<p>And with the power of Apple silicon,</p>
<p>iPhone can run this model every time you tap a key.</p>
<p>Autocorrect is also getting more capable,</p>
<p>with a refreshed design to better support you as you type.</p>
<p>Sentence-level autocorrections</p>
<p>can fix more types of grammatical mistakes.</p>
<p>If an autocorrection isn&rsquo;t quite what you wanted,</p>
<p>tapping on the underlined word shows what you originally typed,</p>
<p>with the option to quickly revert back to it.</p>
<p>And in those moments where you just want to type a ducking word,</p>
<p>well, the keyboard will learn it too.</p>
<p>When it comes to speeding up your typing,</p>
<p>predictive text already helps you quickly finish,</p>
<p>add, or change a word.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;ll get predictions in line as you type,</p>
<p>so finishing a word or even the whole sentence</p>
<p>is as easy as tapping the space bar.</p>
<p>And predictions improve based on the phrases and words you use,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re more personalized.</p>
<p>Another core part of the keyboard is Dictation,</p>
<p>which gets a new Transformer-based speech recognition model</p>
<p>that leverages the Neural Engine</p>
<p>to make Dictation even more accurate.</p>
<p>These updates make typing on iPhone better than ever.</p>
<p>Last, let&rsquo;s talk about some exciting new experiences</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re bringing to iOS 17,</p>
<p>starting with a new way to reflect on and relive special moments.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Adeeti to tell you more.</p>
<p>Adeeti Ullal: Being reminded of life&rsquo;s special moments</p>
<p>is a really powerful thing.</p>
<p>For instance, we often hear about</p>
<p>how much people love watching Memory movies created from their photos.</p>
<p>So we wanted to create a new way</p>
<p>to help people not only remember,</p>
<p>but also write about their experiences,</p>
<p>inspired by rich details from their day,</p>
<p>including people, places, activity, and even music,</p>
<p>in addition to photos.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re excited to introduce Journal,</p>
<p>a brand-new app coming to iPhone later this year.</p>
<p>Journaling is a great way to practice gratitude</p>
<p>and has been shown to improve your wellbeing.</p>
<p>Journal makes it easy to get started and enjoy these benefits.</p>
<p>Using on-device machine learning,</p>
<p>your iPhone can create personalized Suggestions</p>
<p>of moments to inspire your writing.</p>
<p>Suggestions will be intelligently curated from information on your iPhone,</p>
<p>like your photos, location, music, workouts, and more.</p>
<p>And you control what to include when you enable Suggestions,</p>
<p>and which ones to save to your Journal.</p>
<p>And for developers, Suggestions will be available as an API</p>
<p>so they can be used in their apps too.</p>
<p>Some Suggestions are personalized, and some are reflection prompts</p>
<p>to inspire writing across a range of themes.</p>
<p>You can pick any of them to start a new journal entry.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at this one of a trip.</p>
<p>It includes where you went, the music you listened to,</p>
<p>and photos you took there.</p>
<p>You can add these to your journal in one tap.</p>
<p>And when you do, there&rsquo;s even a writing prompt,</p>
<p>like &ldquo;What was the highlight of your visit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s easy to get started.</p>
<p>As you capture life&rsquo;s precious moments,</p>
<p>you can mark important ones and revisit them later</p>
<p>to help you find new insights or set new goals.</p>
<p>And to stay consistent, you can schedule notifications</p>
<p>for the start or end of your day,</p>
<p>to remind you to write and to tell you</p>
<p>when new Suggestions are available.</p>
<p>Of course, your Suggestions and entries are incredibly personal,</p>
<p>and Journal is designed to keep them private.</p>
<p>With on-device processing, end-to-end encryption,</p>
<p>and the ability to lock your journal,</p>
<p>no one but you can access it‚Äì not even Apple.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s Journal.</p>
<p>And now, back to Craig.</p>
<p>Craig: Journal will be a great way to preserve</p>
<p>rich and powerful memories and practice gratitude.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m really excited to tell you about another new experience</p>
<p>coming to iOS 17.</p>
<p>With iPhone in your hand,</p>
<p>you have all the information you need,</p>
<p>right when you need it.</p>
<p>We saw an opportunity to create something new and different</p>
<p>for those moments when you set iPhone down.</p>
<p>We call it StandBy.</p>
<p>Just by turning iPhone on its side while charging,</p>
<p>you get a new full-screen experience</p>
<p>with glanceable information designed to be viewed at a distance.</p>
<p>StandBy is perfect for your nightstand,</p>
<p>kitchen counter, or desk.</p>
<p>And with the Always-On Display on iPhone 14 Pro,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always available.</p>
<p>When you wake up, it&rsquo;s easy to see the time with a clock.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s easy to personalize.</p>
<p>Swipe up to choose from a range of beautiful clock styles.</p>
<p>Swipe to the side,</p>
<p>and you can look back on your favorite moments in photos.</p>
<p>StandBy automatically shuffles through your best shots,</p>
<p>taking full advantage of the screen.</p>
<p>It also embraces the power of widgets,</p>
<p>which are more glanceable than ever.</p>
<p>With a quick swipe on each widget stack,</p>
<p>you can see the current weather, home controls,</p>
<p>or your favorite third-party widgets.</p>
<p>And since these are Smart Stacks,</p>
<p>just like on the Home Screen,</p>
<p>they automatically surface the right information</p>
<p>at the right time.</p>
<p>Like your schedule before a meeting starts.</p>
<p>With support for Live Activities,</p>
<p>you can also see the score of the game</p>
<p>or when your food delivery is arriving.</p>
<p>Siri in StandBy works great,</p>
<p>with rich visual results that are easy to view.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just as easy to ask to play music</p>
<p>or set a timer hands free.</p>
<p>At night, when you&rsquo;re charging iPhone,</p>
<p>StandBy adapts to low light,</p>
<p>taking on a beautiful red tone to help you sleep.</p>
<p>And for each place you charge with MagSafe,</p>
<p>StandBy will remember your preferred view.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s StandBy.</p>
<p>We think it&rsquo;s going to make iPhone even more useful</p>
<p>in those moments when you set it down.</p>
<p>iOS 17 has many more features,</p>
<p>including the ability to simply say &ldquo;Siri&rdquo; to activate Siri.</p>
<p>And now you can issue back-to-back commands</p>
<p>without needing to say &ldquo;Siri&rdquo; again.</p>
<p>In Maps, you can select an area</p>
<p>and download a map to your device to use when you&rsquo;re offline.</p>
<p>And in Photos, the People album is better than ever</p>
<p>at spotting your favorite people,</p>
<p>and now can even recognize the cats and dogs</p>
<p>that are part of your family too.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s iOS 17.</p>
<p>With big updates to the Phone app with new Contact Posters and Live Voicemail,</p>
<p>Messages improvements with a new Stickers experience,</p>
<p>more ways to share with AirDrop,</p>
<p>and improved typing and dictation.</p>
<p>Along with all-new experiences like Journal and StandBy.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s head downstairs to talk about iPadOS.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>iPadOS powers iPad,</p>
<p>our most versatile device,</p>
<p>and it enables our users to do so many things.</p>
<p>Over the years, we&rsquo;ve added features that make it even more capable</p>
<p>from jotting down your latest ideas in Notes,</p>
<p>to working with multiple apps,</p>
<p>to spreading out your projects across displays.</p>
<p>And just last month, we further stretched the bounds of what&rsquo;s possible on iPad</p>
<p>by bringing Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro,</p>
<p>our industry-leading professional video and music creation apps to iPad</p>
<p>redesigned from the ground up to be a touch-first,</p>
<p>all-pro experience for the next-generation of creators.</p>
<p>Our next release, iPadOS 17,</p>
<p>takes iPad even further,</p>
<p>bringing new levels of personalization and making iPad even more capable.</p>
<p>Starting with widgets and the Lock Screen.</p>
<p>Let me show you.</p>
<p>Widgets were designed to quickly convey information at a glance.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ve made widgets interactive,</p>
<p>and I can take action directly in the widget</p>
<p>without even opening an app.</p>
<p>So I can not only see my Reminders,</p>
<p>I can also tap one to mark it as complete right here,</p>
<p>and as I do, the widget gracefully animates it away.</p>
<p>These types of quick interactions are useful in many scenarios.</p>
<p>At home, I can control my lights right from the Home widget.</p>
<p>And start playing an album with the music widget.</p>
<p>And developers can add interactivity to their widgets too.</p>
<p>I can learn something new with flashcards from Quizlet,</p>
<p>and track it with Streaks right away.</p>
<p>We think these interactions with widgets</p>
<p>are gonna make the Home Screen so much more powerful.</p>
<p>Next, we want to bring a greater level of customization</p>
<p>and personalization to another space: the Lock Screen.</p>
<p>Our users love personalizing the iPhone Lock Screen.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re bringing that experience to iPad.</p>
<p>Just tap and hold to get started.</p>
<p>There are so many wonderful wallpaper options,</p>
<p>like Photo Shuffle,</p>
<p>Weather, and Emoji.</p>
<p>And new ones like Kaleidoscope,</p>
<p>with those vibrant jewels and flowers.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve already got a few wallpapers set up</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m excited to show you.</p>
<p>Enjoying my photos on the iPad Lock Screen is just delightful.</p>
<p>And when you select a Live Photo,</p>
<p>we use an advanced machine learning model</p>
<p>to synthesize additional frames</p>
<p>to create a gorgeous, smooth, slow-motion effect</p>
<p>whenever you wake iPad.</p>
<p>Also, we&rsquo;ve optimized wallpapers like Astronomy</p>
<p>for the large display on iPad.</p>
<p>Of course, I can personalize it,</p>
<p>and now choose from any of the planets in the solar system,</p>
<p>each with incredible detail.</p>
<p>And Earth just looks stunning at this scale.</p>
<p>I can tap the time,</p>
<p>to adjust the font, and the color,</p>
<p>and even change the font weight</p>
<p>to get it just right.</p>
<p>Here on the left, there&rsquo;s also a space to add widgets.</p>
<p>The Lock Screen is a great place to see information at a glance</p>
<p>and even perform quick actions.</p>
<p>All right, this looks perfect.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how you can customize your Lock Screen</p>
<p>with iPadOS 17.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>The Lock Screen gets one other feature that makes it even more useful:</p>
<p>Live Activities.</p>
<p>So now, right from the Lock Screen,</p>
<p>you can keep track of a food order with UberEats,</p>
<p>travel plans with Flighty,</p>
<p>the score with Major League Soccer,</p>
<p>or a timer.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re happy to report that now you can even keep track</p>
<p>of multiple timers.</p>
<p>We truly live in an age of wonders.</p>
<p>The new Lock Screen experience on iPad,</p>
<p>combined with interactive widgets on the Home Screen,</p>
<p>is a big step forward for how you can personalize and use iPad.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s talk about an app</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re excited to bring to iPadOS for the first time:</p>
<p>Health.</p>
<p>The Health app has been designed</p>
<p>to take advantage of the larger screen on iPad</p>
<p>so you can see rich details at a glance.</p>
<p>And because your health data is securely synced,</p>
<p>you can see your health information</p>
<p>from your iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch,</p>
<p>as well as compatible third-party apps and devices, all in one place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to see your activity,</p>
<p>keep track of your medications,</p>
<p>and view your trends and highlights.</p>
<p>Interactive charts make your health data come to life,</p>
<p>letting you dive deeply into the details.</p>
<p>And for developers, HealthKit comes to iPad,</p>
<p>opening up new ways to build</p>
<p>innovative health and fitness experiences.</p>
<p>Like Rise, who has built these compelling visualizations</p>
<p>as part of their new iPad app.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s take a look at improvements we&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>to the way you work with another important type of document:</p>
<p>PDFs.</p>
<p>To tell you all about it, here&rsquo;s Jenny.</p>
<p>Jenny Chen: iPad is the best device for PDFs.</p>
<p>They are built right into iPadOS,</p>
<p>so you can open them anywhere,</p>
<p>and they render beautifully.</p>
<p>We use PDFs for so many things,</p>
<p>and we wanted to make them even easier to work with.</p>
<p>Thanks to new machine learning models,</p>
<p>iPadOS can identify the fields in a PDF</p>
<p>so you can use AutoFill to quickly fill them out</p>
<p>with information like names, addresses,</p>
<p>and emails from your contacts.</p>
<p>This even works on documents you scan with the camera.</p>
<p>And if you need to sign it, you can add a saved signature</p>
<p>or make a new one with Apple Pencil.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re ready, you can easily reply back</p>
<p>with your completed form in Mail.</p>
<p>Now, another place where we keep PDFs is in the Notes app.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great for capturing almost any information.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s getting a big upgrade that gives you brand-new ways</p>
<p>to organize, read, annotate, and collaborate on PDFs.</p>
<p>PDFs sit right inside your notes.</p>
<p>You have all of the note-taking capabilities of the app,</p>
<p>and the PDF is expanded to a full-width view.</p>
<p>You can quickly review the document, flip through pages,</p>
<p>and annotate using Apple Pencil.</p>
<p>You can keep multiple PDFs in the same note,</p>
<p>which is great for keeping related files together as you work.</p>
<p>PDFs in Notes are also fantastic for collaboration.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re working together,</p>
<p>you see each other&rsquo;s updates in real time.</p>
<p>So as you scribble something down,</p>
<p>the changes you make appear right away on your collaborator&rsquo;s iPad.</p>
<p>Live collaboration even works with stickers and images.</p>
<p>And when you drop an image into a PDF,</p>
<p>you can still annotate right on top of it.</p>
<p>If you need to finish later,</p>
<p>you can use live collaboration from anywhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even great combined with a FaceTime call.</p>
<p>With PDFs in Notes,</p>
<p>note-taking and mark-up are going to be a breeze.</p>
<p>And now, back to Craig.</p>
<p>Craig: So that&rsquo;s a look at iPadOS 17.</p>
<p>But of course, there&rsquo;s even more,</p>
<p>like improvements to Stage Manager,</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re adding even more flexibility to the position and size of your windows,</p>
<p>giving you more control over your workspace.</p>
<p>And you can now take advantage of the built-in camera</p>
<p>on your external display for FaceTime and conference calls.</p>
<p>And Freeform, which gets new drawing tools like watercolor,</p>
<p>fountain pen, and shape recognition.</p>
<p>Along with a new feature called Follow Along,</p>
<p>that lets you follow a collaborator and track as they move around the canvas.</p>
<p>These join other great features like the redesigned Lock Screen</p>
<p>and interactive widgets,</p>
<p>along with the Health app, and great new ways to work with PDFs,</p>
<p>as well as other features you heard about in iOS,</p>
<p>like leaving a video message in FaceTime,</p>
<p>in-line typing predictions, and updates to Messages.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s turn our attention to macOS.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>macOS is the heart of the Mac.</p>
<p>And with Apple silicon,</p>
<p>the Mac lineup has never been stronger.</p>
<p>Combined with macOS, it enables you to be more productive and creative.</p>
<p>For our next release, we focused on helping you get even more done.</p>
<p>Now, when it came to naming this release,</p>
<p>we turned once again</p>
<p>to Apple&rsquo;s legendary crack Product Marketing team.</p>
<p>The instructions were simple and explicit:</p>
<p>travel far and wide, leave no stone unturned.</p>
<p>Well, as far as we can reconstruct,</p>
<p>that search consisted of piling into their micro bus,</p>
<p>punching the words &ldquo;awesome vineyard&rdquo; into Maps,</p>
<p>and beelining straight to one of the most famous</p>
<p>wine regions in the world,</p>
<p>a place celebrated by the team perhaps a bit too much,</p>
<p>and beloved by millions.</p>
<p>Introducing macOS Sonoma,</p>
<p>a big new release that will make your Mac more delightful</p>
<p>and even more productive.</p>
<p>First, many of the features we talked about earlier</p>
<p>on iOS and iPadOS are going to be great on the Mac.</p>
<p>And macOS Sonoma brings a rich set of features</p>
<p>that elevate the experience of macOS,</p>
<p>starting with stunning new screensavers</p>
<p>that show beautiful slow-motion videos</p>
<p>of places around the world,</p>
<p>like the sweeping skyline of Hong Kong,</p>
<p>the sandstone buttes of Monument Valley,</p>
<p>and the rolling hills of Sonoma.</p>
<p>And when you log in,</p>
<p>this imagery settles beautifully into your desktop.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s talk about making your Mac more personal through widgets.</p>
<p>Not only are they becoming more powerful,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re also now available somewhere new.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look.</p>
<p>Before, widgets on Mac were available here in Notification Center.</p>
<p>But sometimes you want to see information at a glance</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re using your Mac.</p>
<p>Now you can, by simply bringing your widgets</p>
<p>right into view here on the Desktop.</p>
<p>I love to catch a glimpse of my favorite photos</p>
<p>throughout the day‚Äì and weather too.</p>
<p>And I can put these anywhere.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s add Shortcuts here to the bottom left.</p>
<p>To make sure widgets aren&rsquo;t distracting while you&rsquo;re working with apps,</p>
<p>we also came up with a way</p>
<p>to make them glanceable without feeling intrusive.</p>
<p>If I open up Mail,</p>
<p>my widgets instantly fade into the background</p>
<p>so I can focus on the task at hand.</p>
<p>If I switch my wallpaper,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see the widgets are intelligently tinted</p>
<p>based on the color behind them,</p>
<p>so they maintain legibility and the look of my Desktop.</p>
<p>Even the Photos widget adapts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really gorgeous.</p>
<p>To add more widgets, I can bring up the Widget Gallery,</p>
<p>where I have all the widgets I know and love on my Mac.</p>
<p>But I also have some amazing widgets on my iPhone,</p>
<p>and through the magic of Continuity,</p>
<p>I can now access them all right here on my Mac.</p>
<p>So I can see my Apollo for Reddit, HiCoffee,</p>
<p>and even my car widget.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to install these apps on my Mac to use the widgets.</p>
<p>My iPhone just needs to be nearby or on the same Wi-Fi network.</p>
<p>And just like on iPad and iPhone,</p>
<p>widgets on the Mac are now interactive.</p>
<p>So you can use your car widget from your iPhone</p>
<p>to start cooling off your car.</p>
<p>And interactivity can unlock new workflows too.</p>
<p>For example, photographers can select photos on their Desktop,</p>
<p>and with the Shortcuts widget, they can tap into Pixelmator Pro</p>
<p>to apply a signature look and get them ready to submit for a campaign,</p>
<p>all with a single click.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s widgets on Mac,</p>
<p>an entirely new way to personalize your Desktop</p>
<p>and get things done throughout your day.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s talk about gaming,</p>
<p>a space where so much action is happening.</p>
<p>To tell you more, here&rsquo;s Jeremy.</p>
<p>Jeremy Sandmel: Apple silicon fundamentally changed the game,</p>
<p>delivering incredible graphics performance to every Mac.</p>
<p>And now, tens of millions of Macs can run demanding games</p>
<p>with great performance, long battery life,</p>
<p>and breathtaking visuals,</p>
<p>presenting an unprecedented opportunity</p>
<p>for developers to bring their games to more players than ever before.</p>
<p>And since introducing Metal 3</p>
<p>with powerful new features like MetalFX Upscaling,</p>
<p>demanding games like &ldquo;Resident Evil: Village&rdquo;</p>
<p>have seen huge performance gains.</p>
<p>This year, macOS takes the gaming experience even further</p>
<p>with Game Mode,</p>
<p>giving players an edge when performance is measured</p>
<p>in precious milliseconds,</p>
<p>ensuring the game gets the highest priority on the CPU and GPU,</p>
<p>keeping your background tasks to a lower usage,</p>
<p>and delivering an optimized gaming experience</p>
<p>with even smoother and more consistent frame rates.</p>
<p>And Game Mode makes gaming on Mac even more immersive,</p>
<p>dramatically lowering audio latency with AirPods,</p>
<p>and significantly reducing input latency</p>
<p>with Xbox and PlayStation controllers by doubling the Bluetooth sampling rate,</p>
<p>providing in-game responsiveness you can really feel.</p>
<p>Game Mode works with any game,</p>
<p>including all of these recent and upcoming Mac games.</p>
<p>We are so excited to see developers bringing more games to the Mac.</p>
<p>And to help with that,</p>
<p>Metal provides a new Game Porting Toolkit</p>
<p>to make it even easier for developers to port their games</p>
<p>from other platforms.</p>
<p>These new tools enable developers to quickly evaluate</p>
<p>just how well their game could run on Mac.</p>
<p>A process that used to take months can now be done in days.</p>
<p>And they dramatically simplify the process</p>
<p>of converting the game&rsquo;s shaders and graphics code</p>
<p>to take full advantage of the powerful features</p>
<p>and performance of Apple silicon,</p>
<p>significantly reducing the total development time.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s another big game coming to Mac this year.</p>
<p>To tell you all about it, here&rsquo;s legendary game creator</p>
<p>Kojima-san from Kojima Productions.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Hideo Kojima: [speaking Japanese]</p>
<p>Craig: Thanks, Kojima-san.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s shift to the ways macOS will help you be more productive,</p>
<p>starting with video conferencing.</p>
<p>We spend a lot of time on video calls,</p>
<p>but when you share your screen,</p>
<p>your face and presence can get lost.</p>
<p>This year, we have great new ways to help you present remotely.</p>
<p>A new video effect called Presenter Overlay</p>
<p>elevates your presence by including you</p>
<p>on top of the content you&rsquo;re sharing.</p>
<p>With small overlay, your face appears in a movable bubble.</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s easy to be seen while showcasing your work.</p>
<p>With large overlay, you remain prominent,</p>
<p>while your shared screen is framed beautifully next to you.</p>
<p>We separate you from the background</p>
<p>and layer your screen in between.</p>
<p>So you can walk, talk, and move in front of your content.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Neural Engine in Apple silicon,</p>
<p>you get amazing quality.</p>
<p>We also have a new reactions video effect.</p>
<p>When you want to let others know how you feel,</p>
<p>you can add a reaction that seamlessly blends your video</p>
<p>with balloons, confetti, hearts, and more.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re fun and have a cinematic quality with depth and focus.</p>
<p>And you can trigger these effects with a gesture.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re really impressed, two thumbs up brings on</p>
<p>a celebratory display of fireworks.</p>
<p>You can use these new video effects with any app,</p>
<p>like FaceTime, Zoom, Teams, Webex, and more.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s talk about Safari, and how we&rsquo;re taking it to the next level.</p>
<p>To tell you more, here&rsquo;s Beth.</p>
<p>Beth Dakin: Safari is the best way to browse the web.</p>
<p>With macOS Sonoma, Safari is the world&rsquo;s fastest browser.</p>
<p>It renders cutting-edge websites with amazing speed.</p>
<p>Safari is powered by WebKit,</p>
<p>which provides incredible technology that is used by over a million apps.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re constantly updating WebKit.</p>
<p>In just the past few months,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve added even more features for developers,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re adding even more,</p>
<p>including beautiful advancements to typography.</p>
<p>Another cornerstone of the Safari experience is Privacy.</p>
<p>Safari was built from the ground up to protect your privacy</p>
<p>and was the first browser to introduce Private Browsing.</p>
<p>This year, we&rsquo;re taking it a step further.</p>
<p>Private Browsing now locks your private browsing windows</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re not using them,</p>
<p>completely blocks known trackers from loading on pages,</p>
<p>and removes tracking from URLs as you browse in Private Browsing.</p>
<p>Of course, one of the best ways to protect yourself on the web</p>
<p>is with a strong password,</p>
<p>or even better, a passkey.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re now adding the ability to securely share passwords</p>
<p>and passkeys with the people you&rsquo;re closest with.</p>
<p>Everyone in a group can add and edit passwords</p>
<p>to keep them up to date.</p>
<p>And since sharing is through iCloud Keychain,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s end-to-end encrypted.</p>
<p>We have another exciting update to help you stay organized with Profiles.</p>
<p>Many of us use Safari for a mix of work and personal browsing,</p>
<p>and would love a way to separate browsing between topics.</p>
<p>Profiles help you separate your cookies,</p>
<p>history, extensions, Tab Groups, and favorites.</p>
<p>So you can sign into the same site with your work account</p>
<p>and personal account and quickly switch between them.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re a student, set up a unique collection</p>
<p>of extensions and favorites just for school.</p>
<p>Last, we&rsquo;re giving you a faster way to access your favorite sites</p>
<p>with web apps on Mac.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s check them out.</p>
<p>With web apps, we&rsquo;re elevating the websites you use most often</p>
<p>with some of the same great features as apps.</p>
<p>I use Confluence all the time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make it a web app so it doesn&rsquo;t get lost in my other browsing.</p>
<p>From the File menu, I can click Add to Dock,</p>
<p>and the title and icon load automatically.</p>
<p>When I click Add, the icon instantly appears in the dock.</p>
<p>Now I can close this window in Safari.</p>
<p>When I launch my web app,</p>
<p>I get an app-like experience with a simplified toolbar.</p>
<p>On Mac, you can create a web app for any website,</p>
<p>and developers don&rsquo;t have to do any extra work</p>
<p>for their web app to look great.</p>
<p>Web apps are integrated right into my experience on Mac.</p>
<p>So I can Command-Tab to access my Pinterest web app.</p>
<p>It also works great with Stage Manager, Mission Control,</p>
<p>Spotlight, and other ways you access apps.</p>
<p>You can get notifications too.</p>
<p>So Instacart can let me know my order&rsquo;s been delivered.</p>
<p>And with a click, I&rsquo;m into my Instacart web app.</p>
<p>Web apps make it even easier to get to your favorite websites on Mac.</p>
<p>Back to you, Craig.</p>
<p>Craig: With Profiles, web apps, and a huge update to Private Browsing,</p>
<p>Safari is simply the best way to browse the web.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s macOS Sonoma,</p>
<p>featuring more ways to personalize with widgets</p>
<p>and stunning new screensavers,</p>
<p>new levels of gaming performance,</p>
<p>and powerful productivity for video conferencing and Safari.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s take a look at Audio and Home experiences.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re rocking out to your favorite &rsquo;80s metal band</p>
<p>or watching the latest show to relax after work,</p>
<p>we continue to focus on features that entertain, inspire,</p>
<p>and bring us closer together.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start off with what&rsquo;s new for AirPods.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Ron to tell you more.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Ron Huang: AirPods are the most popular headphones in the world,</p>
<p>providing the best personal audio experience throughout your day.</p>
<p>From Active Noise Cancellation,</p>
<p>which removes unwanted background noise so it&rsquo;s easier to focus,</p>
<p>to Transparency mode, which keeps you connected to the world around you</p>
<p>while reducing loud environmental noise in real time.</p>
<p>Our users love these features today,</p>
<p>and there is even more we can do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we are excited to announce Adaptive Audio.</p>
<p>It combines the best of both listening modes into one,</p>
<p>making it even easier to move through environments</p>
<p>and interactions that are constantly changing.</p>
<p>Adaptive Audio dynamically blends Transparency and Active Noise Cancellation</p>
<p>to match the conditions of your surroundings.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>[bell dings]</p>
<p>So you can stay present within your environment</p>
<p>while distracting noises are automatically reduced.</p>
<p>[leaf blower whirring]</p>
<p>[leaf blower muted]</p>
<p>Adaptive Audio also helps your focus</p>
<p>on your favorite music or podcast.</p>
<p>And now with Personalized Volume,</p>
<p>we use machine learning to understand your listening preferences over time,</p>
<p>together with the outside conditions,</p>
<p>to deliver the best media experience for you in the moment.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also adding an incredible new way to engage with others around you</p>
<p>while wearing AirPods Pro.</p>
<p>Just start speaking, and Conversation Awareness</p>
<p>will automatically lower your music,</p>
<p>focus on the voices in front of you,</p>
<p>and reduce background noise.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hey, Corey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hey. How you doing? - Good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you gonna be at the C141278 meeting later?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Definitely. I&rsquo;ll be there. - Awesome.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got something I&rsquo;d love to run by you.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Look forward to it. - See you there!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>See you! - [laughs]</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ron: Another AirPods benefit is being able to take calls on the go.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hey, there. - Hey. How&rsquo;s it going?</li>
</ul>
<p>Ron: Adaptive Audio helps when you&rsquo;re on a call in loud environments as well,</p>
<p>by proactively reducing the noise around you.</p>
<p>[marching band music]</p>
<p>[muted music continues]</p>
<p>Ron: And for added convenience, you can press to quickly mute</p>
<p>or unmute yourself as needed.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also improving the AirPods automatic switching experience across the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Now it is significantly faster to transition from a conference call on Mac</p>
<p>to your favorite playlist on iPhone, all without missing a beat.</p>
<p>And for the moments when you want to share your content with those around you,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s AirPlay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll hand it over to Anne to tell you about what&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Anne Park Shedlosky: AirPlay is the easiest way to share your audio,</p>
<p>videos, and photos to nearby speakers and screens.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re making AirPlay more seamless than ever.</p>
<p>Your iPhone and iPad now use on-device intelligence</p>
<p>to learn your AirPlay preferences.</p>
<p>So if you usually listen to music while you cook dinner,</p>
<p>the nearby HomePod in the kitchen will automatically show up.</p>
<p>And not only can you start to play music using AirPlay from your iPhone,</p>
<p>you can now also ask Siri on your HomePod to start an AirPlay session,</p>
<p>letting you play even more of your favorite content using just your voice.</p>
<p>Just say, &ldquo;Siri, play Arlo Parks on SoundCloud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With so much media at your fingertips on your iPhone and iPad,</p>
<p>you can enjoy your content from anywhere, even when traveling.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re excited about launching AirPlay in hotels.</p>
<p>With AirPlay support in hotels, it&rsquo;s easy to take advantage of the big screen</p>
<p>in your room to watch an episode of your favorite show,</p>
<p>or practice tomorrow&rsquo;s presentation.</p>
<p>Pairing is simple.</p>
<p>Just scan the QR code and tap the confirmation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re automatically connected to Wi-Fi</p>
<p>and ready to resume watching from right where you left off.</p>
<p>AirPlay will be available in select hotels before the end of the year,</p>
<p>with more to follow.</p>
<p>And to make your next trip even more enjoyable,</p>
<p>we have some exciting updates coming to Apple Music and CarPlay.</p>
<p>Today, adding a song to a road trip might mean sharing a phone,</p>
<p>passing a cable, or sending a link.</p>
<p>We want to make it easier for others in the car to control the music</p>
<p>and add to what&rsquo;s playing‚Äì even passengers in the back seat.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re thrilled to bring SharePlay to the car.</p>
<p>Now, when the driver&rsquo;s iPhone is connected to CarPlay,</p>
<p>any passenger&rsquo;s iPhone will automatically suggest joining their session.</p>
<p>Just tap to connect.</p>
<p>From there, it&rsquo;s easy to play your favorite music,</p>
<p>control playback, and enjoy the ride together.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s turn to tvOS and Apple TV,</p>
<p>which work incredibly well with all your Apple devices</p>
<p>to deliver the best of television, along with all of your entertainment.</p>
<p>In tvOS 17, we&rsquo;ve completely redesigned Control Center,</p>
<p>making it more intuitive to do things like access AirPods settings,</p>
<p>home cameras, system controls,</p>
<p>and user profiles‚Äì</p>
<p>all with a touch of the Siri Remote.</p>
<p>And for the times when you can&rsquo;t find your Siri Remote,</p>
<p>you can now use your iPhone to locate it, and get back to watching TV.</p>
<p>Sometimes what you really want to watch isn&rsquo;t a show at all.</p>
<p>It could be your favorite family photos that fill the room with joy.</p>
<p>Now to enjoy these special moments even more,</p>
<p>you can select Memories as your screensaver</p>
<p>and see your photos perfectly framed with fluid animations and transitions.</p>
<p>Our home is also where we connect with loved ones.</p>
<p>And, for times when we&rsquo;re not in the same place,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re excited to introduce a new feature that will transform your living room.</p>
<p>FaceTime is coming to Apple TV.</p>
<p>Now everyone can gather on the couch</p>
<p>and catch up with friends and family on the big screen.</p>
<p>The new FaceTime app on Apple TV takes advantage of Continuity Camera</p>
<p>to unlock incredible shared experiences at home.</p>
<p>So when you launch FaceTime on Apple TV,</p>
<p>it wirelessly connects to your iPhone or iPad</p>
<p>and lets you use their camera and microphone to join a call.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s check it out.</p>
<p>You can place a call on your iPhone or from Apple TV.</p>
<p>Or you can pick up a call from a friend on your iPhone</p>
<p>and easily move it to Apple TV.</p>
<p>Apple TV takes full advantage of the cameras on your iPhone and iPad</p>
<p>for effects like Center Stage.</p>
<p>As you move around or when someone enters the room,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll always stay perfectly framed.</p>
<p>At any time, you can interact using gestures</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll show up on everyone&rsquo;s screen.</p>
<p>And because it&rsquo;s Apple TV,</p>
<p>you have access to all of your favorite shows and movies.</p>
<p>With SharePlay, you can easily watch together and everyone stays in sync.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s FaceTime on Apple TV.</p>
<p>And for developers, we&rsquo;re adding Continuity Camera APIs</p>
<p>to make the biggest screen in your home more connected and entertaining.</p>
<p>So apps like Zoom and Webex will be coming to tvOS</p>
<p>for the very first time by the end of this year.</p>
<p>These are some of the features coming to Audio and Home.</p>
<p>AirPods take personal audio to the next level with Adaptive Audio.</p>
<p>AirPlay is coming to hotels,</p>
<p>so you can enjoy your content on the big screen when traveling.</p>
<p>Apple Music lets everyone control music in the car with SharePlay.</p>
<p>And FaceTime comes to Apple TV,</p>
<p>bringing everyone closer together through incredible new experiences.</p>
<p>Next, here&rsquo;s Kevin to tell you about the updates coming to watchOS.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Kevin Lynch: WatchOS is the world&rsquo;s most advanced wearable operating system,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s redefined how people all over the world think of what a watch can do.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve continued this transformation</p>
<p>through new features designed to help keep you connected,</p>
<p>active, healthy, and safe.</p>
<p>As Apple Watch has evolved over the years,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s become even more intuitive, and more powerful,</p>
<p>providing easier access to vital information.</p>
<p>And today, we&rsquo;re excited to take this further</p>
<p>with watchOS 10.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re celebrating this huge milestone</p>
<p>with a new way to view information quickly from any watch face</p>
<p>and comprehensive app redesigns across watchOS.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Rhythm is our business ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Rhythm is our business ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ And it&rsquo;s time ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ To get down ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Down ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Whoo ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ To business ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Rhythm is our business ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Rhythm is our business ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Rhythm is our business ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Rhythm is our business ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>This is such an energizing new approach for Apple Watch.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a closer look.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re introducing a way for you to enjoy a beautiful watch face,</p>
<p>like Portraits, while still giving you quick access</p>
<p>to information you care about.</p>
<p>Now from any watch face, you can simply turn the Digital Crown</p>
<p>to reveal widgets in a Smart Stack.</p>
<p>I can start off my day with a glance at the forecast and headlines.</p>
<p>And the Smart Stack uses machine learning</p>
<p>to show you relevant information right when you need it.</p>
<p>So later in the day, you&rsquo;ll see some upcoming meetings,</p>
<p>tasks you need to complete, or medications to log.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so convenient to check what you have to take care of next.</p>
<p>And you can long press to add a widget to the Smart Stack,</p>
<p>like Sleep Data.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s even a widget that can hold your favorite complications,</p>
<p>like Timers.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start a timer.</p>
<p>Now, when I&rsquo;m back at my watch face,</p>
<p>I can simply scroll up, and the timer shows up right here,</p>
<p>so you can easily see how much time is left</p>
<p>or pause it with a tap.</p>
<p>This also works great for other active sessions</p>
<p>like Stopwatch, Workouts, or listening to Podcasts.</p>
<p>This is a fast new way to view information from any watch face.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also redesigned apps across watchOS 10.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at a couple of examples,</p>
<p>starting with World Clock,</p>
<p>which now features dynamic background colors</p>
<p>that reflect the time of day.</p>
<p>And I can easily see when it might be a good time</p>
<p>to call a friend in a different time zone.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s also check out the Activity app.</p>
<p>The app redesign includes corner icons that I can tap</p>
<p>to get to my weekly summary, sharing, or awards.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve even redesigned the trophy case</p>
<p>so you can see awards in progress and Challenges you&rsquo;ve completed.</p>
<p>And when you rotate the Digital Crown, it shows new, full-screen views</p>
<p>for Move, Exercise, and Stand.</p>
<p>Developers can also use this new design language to update apps.</p>
<p>Streaks now utilizes the entire display</p>
<p>so you can easily see your progress and access your tasks.</p>
<p>NBA makes keeping up with your favorite team</p>
<p>even more compelling with team colors and new game details.</p>
<p>And with Waterllama&rsquo;s redesign,</p>
<p>you can see your hydration details from the last seven days</p>
<p>with just a turn of the Digital Crown.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also introducing two new watch faces.</p>
<p>Palette is a beautiful new face</p>
<p>where time is depicted in a wide variety of gorgeous colors</p>
<p>using three distinct overlapping layers.</p>
<p>As the time changes, the colors on the display shift as well.</p>
<p>And to celebrate watchOS 10, we&rsquo;re bringing&hellip;</p>
<p>Snoopy and Woodstock to Apple Watch.</p>
<p>These beloved comic strip characters come to life</p>
<p>in many different animations.</p>
<p>They can be playful with the Watch hands&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;react to the weather conditions in your area&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;or even get active with you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terrific to have Snoopy on Apple Watch.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so excited for you to experience your Apple Watch in a whole new way,</p>
<p>with redesigned apps that provide more information at a glance,</p>
<p>and new ways to navigate and quickly access your content,</p>
<p>all powered by the intelligence of watchOS 10.</p>
<p>And if that wasn&rsquo;t enough,</p>
<p>we have more features to keep you active,</p>
<p>starting with Cycling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a competitive sport for some</p>
<p>and a great way to exercise for others.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Eric to tell you about some new features</p>
<p>that will make Apple Watch an even more essential companion</p>
<p>for cyclists.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Eric Charles: Apple Watch has a lot of great cycling features already,</p>
<p>like notifying you to start a workout if you forgot</p>
<p>and the safety potential of Fall Detection.</p>
<p>For many riders, accessories like speed and cadence sensors,</p>
<p>as well as power meters, provide important training data.</p>
<p>In watchOS 10, Apple Watch can now connect</p>
<p>to Bluetooth-enabled bike sensors.</p>
<p>So you can add cadence and power to your standard metrics</p>
<p>and even try out a new Cycling Power workout view.</p>
<p>Using power, heart rate, and motion data,</p>
<p>Apple Watch will estimate your Functional Threshold Power,</p>
<p>known as FTP,</p>
<p>which is the highest level of cycling intensity</p>
<p>that you could theoretically maintain for an hour.</p>
<p>And by taking a percentage of your FTP,</p>
<p>we can provide Power Zones,</p>
<p>where you can easily see which zone you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>and track how long you spend in each.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an effective and reliable way</p>
<p>of improving your performance on a bike.</p>
<p>We knew that we could do even more for our entire cycling community,</p>
<p>so we built a new feature</p>
<p>that requires no additional equipment,</p>
<p>except your paired iPhone.</p>
<p>In watchOS 10, cycling workouts from your Apple Watch</p>
<p>now automatically show up as a live activity on your iPhone.</p>
<p>Tapping the live activity will take over the entire display.</p>
<p>This is perfect for views like Heart Rate zones,</p>
<p>Elevation, Power Zones,</p>
<p>as well as a new view for current and max speed, distance, and more.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to love these new workout metrics,</p>
<p>views, and experiences on your next ride.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s talk about Hiking and how we&rsquo;re updating Compass and Maps</p>
<p>for your outdoor adventures.</p>
<p>In watchOS 10, Compass will automatically generate</p>
<p>two new waypoints for you.</p>
<p>A new Cellular Connection Waypoint</p>
<p>will indicate the last place you had reception with your carrier</p>
<p>if you ever need to check your messages</p>
<p>or make a call to your family.</p>
<p>And in the case of an emergency,</p>
<p>another new waypoint will indicate where on your route</p>
<p>you can make an emergency call</p>
<p>using any available carrier&rsquo;s network.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also introducing a new Elevation view.</p>
<p>Using Altimeter data,</p>
<p>you can see a three-dimensional view of your saved waypoints.</p>
<p>In addition to these new Compass features, we&rsquo;re also updating Maps.</p>
<p>Starting in the U.S., we&rsquo;re introducing a new Topographic map with contour lines,</p>
<p>hill shading, and elevation details,</p>
<p>along with points of interest and trailheads.</p>
<p>You can use search to discover nearby trails</p>
<p>and trailhead categories.</p>
<p>And before you head out,</p>
<p>you can review additional information,</p>
<p>such as trail name, difficulty level,</p>
<p>length, elevation gain, and more.</p>
<p>watchOS 10 also introduces new APIs for developers</p>
<p>to create compelling workout experiences.</p>
<p>The powerful motion sensors on Apple Watch Series 8 and Ultra</p>
<p>can detect rapid changes in direction and acceleration,</p>
<p>like when swinging a golf club or a tennis racket.</p>
<p>Developers will have access to this high frequency motion data.</p>
<p>For example, Golfshot can detect small wrist movements</p>
<p>to refine your golf swing.</p>
<p>Or to help your tennis serve,</p>
<p>SwingVision can analyze your pronation,</p>
<p>which is the twisting motion of your forearm, wrist, and hand.</p>
<p>And apps like Training Peaks</p>
<p>will be able to use a new API to create a workout program</p>
<p>that you can access directly from the Workout app on Apple Watch.</p>
<p>These new developer features join the other great experiences</p>
<p>in watchOS 10 to keep you active.</p>
<p>Our users also love using Apple Watch to help them stay healthy.</p>
<p>To tell you what&rsquo;s coming for your health, here&rsquo;s Sumbul.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ You&rsquo;re the healer ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Keep me busy ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Ah, ah, ah, can&rsquo;t let you go ‚ô™</p>
<p>Sumbul Ahmad Desai: Apple Watch and iPhone</p>
<p>offer many important health features,</p>
<p>like medications, sleep, and mobility.</p>
<p>With watchOS 10 and iOS 17,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re moving into two new areas that as always,</p>
<p>are grounded in science with privacy at the core.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s talk about mental health.</p>
<p>We believe mental health is as important as your physical health,</p>
<p>and even contributes to it.</p>
<p>This is something that impacts each and every one of us.</p>
<p>So this year, we want to shine a light on mental health</p>
<p>and empower you to care for your mind</p>
<p>just as you do for your body.</p>
<p>Reflecting on your state of mind can help you build emotional awareness</p>
<p>and resilience.</p>
<p>Experts say, &ldquo;Identifying our feelings has been shown</p>
<p>&ldquo;to help us manage difficult emotions,</p>
<p>appreciate positive moments, and improve wellbeing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll now be able to log your momentary emotion</p>
<p>and your daily mood in a discreet and convenient way</p>
<p>from the Mindfulness app in watchOS 10.</p>
<p>You can use the digital crown</p>
<p>to scroll through the engaging multidimensional shapes</p>
<p>and choose how you&rsquo;re feeling.</p>
<p>For added benefit to your wellbeing,</p>
<p>you can also identify what&rsquo;s making you feel that way.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s your family or travel,</p>
<p>and you can describe your feelings further,</p>
<p>like grateful or excited.</p>
<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t have an Apple Watch,</p>
<p>you can use the Health app on iPhone and iPad</p>
<p>to log your state of mind.</p>
<p>You can see insights, like what&rsquo;s been contributing most</p>
<p>to your state of mind,</p>
<p>and how your lifestyle might be playing a role,</p>
<p>such as exercise, mindful minutes, and sleep.</p>
<p>There may be times when it would be helpful</p>
<p>to more deeply understand your state of mind</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;d benefit from some additional support.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll now be able to take standardized assessments</p>
<p>often used in clinics to answer questions about how you&rsquo;re feeling</p>
<p>right in the Health app,</p>
<p>and then see your current risk for depression or anxiety,</p>
<p>two very common and treatable conditions.</p>
<p>This will help you understand if you should talk to someone.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have a report of your results to share with a care provider,</p>
<p>and you can access helpful articles and resources.</p>
<p>We know it&rsquo;s important to prioritize mental health‚Äì</p>
<p>to build emotional awareness and resilience</p>
<p>by reflecting on your state of mind‚Äì</p>
<p>and have screening tools and resources to support you</p>
<p>on your overall health journey.</p>
<p>The other important area of focus for us this year is vision health,</p>
<p>and specifically the reduction of myopia,</p>
<p>which is nearsightedness that&rsquo;s caused by physical changes in the eye.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the leading cause of vision impairment globally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s currently estimated to affect over 30% of the population.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s expected to grow to 50% by 2050,</p>
<p>impacting five billion people.</p>
<p>Myopia typically starts in childhood,</p>
<p>and there are a few behaviors that can lower a child&rsquo;s risk of developing it.</p>
<p>One is to spend more time outdoors in daylight.</p>
<p>Experts recommend at least 80 to 120 minutes a day,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s hard to know if your child has done that.</p>
<p>Now Apple Watch can measure</p>
<p>the amount of time spent in daylight</p>
<p>using the ambient light sensor,</p>
<p>and it can be viewed in the Health app.</p>
<p>With Family Setup, time in daylight can be measured</p>
<p>from a child&rsquo;s Apple Watch</p>
<p>even if they don&rsquo;t have their own iPhone.</p>
<p>And with Health Sharing, parents will be able to keep track of it.</p>
<p>Another behavior that can lower myopia risk in kids</p>
<p>is to increase the distance</p>
<p>at which they view something, like a device or a book.</p>
<p>To help with this, we&rsquo;re introducing a new feature called Screen Distance.</p>
<p>It uses the same TrueDepth camera</p>
<p>that powers Face ID on iPad and iPhone</p>
<p>to measure if a child is holding their device too close</p>
<p>for an extended period of time,</p>
<p>and then encourages them to move their device farther away.</p>
<p>Screen Distance can also help adults reduce digital eye strain.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to provide new ways</p>
<p>to track and manage vision health.</p>
<p>Back to you, Kevin.</p>
<p>Kevin: Adding support for these two areas</p>
<p>can give you even more insight into your health.</p>
<p>And as always, privacy is core to our work.</p>
<p>Your information in the Health app,</p>
<p>including mental health and vision health data,</p>
<p>is encrypted on-device</p>
<p>and only accessible with your passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s never shared without your explicit permission.</p>
<p>watchOS 10 is a major milestone,</p>
<p>giving Apple Watch an enormous update</p>
<p>with a fresh, new design to quickly view information,</p>
<p>delightful new watch faces,</p>
<p>new features for cyclists and hikers,</p>
<p>and important tools for health.</p>
<p>Back to you, Craig.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Craig: So those are our updates to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS,</p>
<p>and the software that powers Audio and Home.</p>
<p>With each, we continue our commitment</p>
<p>to delivering unique capabilities</p>
<p>tailor-made for each device</p>
<p>while simultaneously designing for a consistent experience,</p>
<p>with features and capabilities that work across them.</p>
<p>This is a big year for developers,</p>
<p>with new APIs across all platforms</p>
<p>that will enable you to build even more innovations into your apps.</p>
<p>And we have an exciting week ahead</p>
<p>starting with the Platforms State of the Union,</p>
<p>along with 175 sessions,</p>
<p>opportunities to engage with Apple engineers</p>
<p>through one-on-one labs,</p>
<p>as well as other activities to interact with our global developer community.</p>
<p>Our OS releases will be available as developer betas today,</p>
<p>and each of them will have a public beta next month.</p>
<p>All of these OS releases will be available to our users this fall.</p>
<p>Now, back to Tim.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Tim: Thanks, Craig.</p>
<p>Today we introduced some amazing new Macs</p>
<p>and showed you where we&rsquo;re taking the incredible software platforms</p>
<p>that drive our products.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already been a big day.</p>
<p>But we do have</p>
<p>one more thing.</p>
<p>This is a day that&rsquo;s been years in the making‚Äì</p>
<p>one that I&rsquo;ve really been looking forward to.</p>
<p>I believe that augmented reality is a profound technology.</p>
<p>Blending digital content with the real world</p>
<p>can unlock experiences like nothing we&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>So today I&rsquo;m excited to announce</p>
<p>an entirely new AR platform</p>
<p>with a revolutionary new product.</p>
<p>And here it is.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Introducing Apple Vision Pro.</p>
<p>Vision Pro is a new kind of computer</p>
<p>that augments reality by seamlessly blending the real world</p>
<p>with the digital world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first Apple product you look through and not at.</p>
<p>Vision Pro feels familiar, yet it&rsquo;s entirely new.</p>
<p>You can see, hear, and interact with digital content</p>
<p>just like it&rsquo;s in your physical space.</p>
<p>And you control Vision Pro using the most natural and intuitive tools:</p>
<p>your eyes, hands, and voice.</p>
<p>With Vision Pro, you&rsquo;re no longer limited by a display.</p>
<p>Your surroundings become an infinite canvas.</p>
<p>Use your apps anywhere and make them any size you want.</p>
<p>Capture photos and videos, and relive your most important memories</p>
<p>in an entirely new way.</p>
<p>Watch your movies, shows, and sports,</p>
<p>and immerse yourself in games on a giant screen</p>
<p>surrounded by Spatial Audio.</p>
<p>And connect with people as if you&rsquo;re sharing the same space.</p>
<p>These are just some of the ways that Vision Pro blends digital content</p>
<p>into the space around us.</p>
<p>So in the same way that Mac introduced us to personal computing</p>
<p>and iPhone introduced us to mobile computing,</p>
<p>Apple Vision Pro will introduce us to spatial computing.</p>
<p>This marks the beginning of a journey</p>
<p>that will bring a new dimension to powerful, personal technology.</p>
<p>To tell you about the experience of using Vision Pro, here&rsquo;s Alan.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Alan Dye: Apple Vision Pro allows us the freedom to imagine an experience</p>
<p>unlike anything we&rsquo;ve created before.</p>
<p>For the first time, we&rsquo;ve designed a fully three-dimensional interface‚Äì</p>
<p>one magically controlled with just your eyes, hands, and voice.</p>
<p>When you first put on Vision Pro,</p>
<p>you see your space and everything in it.</p>
<p>The Home View lives right in front of you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s where you find all of your apps.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s familiar, yet revolutionary.</p>
<p>The entire interface looks and feels truly present in your room.</p>
<p>Every element has been crafted to have a sense of physicality.</p>
<p>They have dimension, respond dynamically to light,</p>
<p>and even cast shadows to help you understand scale and distance.</p>
<p>Experiences in Vision Pro</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t constrained to the boundaries of a display‚Äì</p>
<p>they can freely fill the space around you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to make apps any scale, even larger than life.</p>
<p>And you can place apps exactly where you want them, anywhere in your space.</p>
<p>It feels natural, like moving real objects.</p>
<p>And launching new apps doesn&rsquo;t take space from existing ones.</p>
<p>They simply occupy a new space, centered around you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something truly extraordinary about seeing your favorite apps</p>
<p>and experiences right there in the room with you.</p>
<p>And apps can expand fully into your space, like during a Mindfulness session,</p>
<p>where you can create a private moment of calm.</p>
<p>And with Vision Pro, apps and experiences can do something else remarkable.</p>
<p>They can grow beyond the dimensions of your physical room with Environments.</p>
<p>Environments extend and transform your space,</p>
<p>enabling otherwise impossible experiences.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve been captured fully volumetrically.</p>
<p>So you can control how immersed you are by simply turning the Digital Crown.</p>
<p>Whether extending a small portion of your room</p>
<p>or being fully immersed within an Environment,</p>
<p>you can use these beautiful landscapes to focus,</p>
<p>reduce clutter in busy spaces,</p>
<p>or as an inspiring new view.</p>
<p>Every major Apple platform was driven by an innovative new input model.</p>
<p>Mac with the mouse.</p>
<p>iPod with the Click Wheel.</p>
<p>And iPhone with Multi-Touch.</p>
<p>With Vision Pro, we set the ambitious goal</p>
<p>to design an incredibly intuitive input model for spatial computing‚Äì</p>
<p>one that can be used without controllers or additional hardware.</p>
<p>Apple Vision Pro relies solely on your eyes, hands, and voice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just you and your content.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s remarkable, and it feels like magic.</p>
<p>You browse the system simply by looking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s effortless.</p>
<p>App icons subtly come to life when you look at them.</p>
<p>In fact, every graphical element has a sense of vitality</p>
<p>and responds to your eyes.</p>
<p>Simply tap your fingers together to select and gently flick to scroll.</p>
<p>The combination of hands and eyes together truly feels like magic‚Äì</p>
<p>as if your mind is guiding the experience.</p>
<p>And we designed every gesture to be as subtle and natural as possible,</p>
<p>so you can keep your hands where they&rsquo;re most comfortable,</p>
<p>like resting in your lap, or on the sofa.</p>
<p>And the entire experience is made better with voice.</p>
<p>With Vision Pro, you can look at a search field</p>
<p>and just start dictating.</p>
<p>Voice input has never been this seamless.</p>
<p>And with Siri, you can quickly open or close apps,</p>
<p>play media, and more.</p>
<p>Another foundational design goal for Vision Pro</p>
<p>was that you&rsquo;re never isolated from the people around you.</p>
<p>You can see them, and they can see you.</p>
<p>Your eyes are a critical indicator of connection and emotion,</p>
<p>so Vision Pro displays your eyes when someone is nearby.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>This breakthrough innovation is called EyeSight.</p>
<p>Not only does Eyesight reveal your eyes,</p>
<p>it provides important cues to others about what you&rsquo;re focused on.</p>
<p>This is how it looks when using apps.</p>
<p>And this changes when you&rsquo;re fully immersed in an experience,</p>
<p>sending a clear signal to those around you that you can&rsquo;t see them at the moment.</p>
<p>But even if you are fully immersed,</p>
<p>Apple Vision Pro helps you stay connected to those around you.</p>
<p>When someone is nearby, they will appear in your view.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hey.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alan: And Vision Pro will simultaneously reveal your eyes to them.</p>
<p>The spatial experiences of Vision Pro</p>
<p>seamlessly blend the digital and physical worlds,</p>
<p>transforming what&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Whether at home or at work, it unlocks magical new experiences.</p>
<p>To show you what it&rsquo;s like to use Apple Vision Pro,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s Allessandra.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Allessandra McGinnis: Let&rsquo;s see Apple Vision Pro in action for work.</p>
<p>Vision Pro has the apps you love and count on every day.</p>
<p>But now, these apps are freed from the confines of a display</p>
<p>and live in your space,</p>
<p>transforming how you use Notes, Messages,</p>
<p>Keynote, Safari, FaceTime, and more.</p>
<p>And of course, Vision Pro is always in sync with your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.</p>
<p>All your notes, messages, photos, and documents</p>
<p>stay up to date automatically with iCloud.</p>
<p>This is what you see with Vision Pro.</p>
<p>Your entire world is a canvas for apps,</p>
<p>so you can arrange them anywhere‚Äì</p>
<p>at the perfect size for whatever you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look first at Safari.</p>
<p>Browsing the web is fantastic‚Äì</p>
<p>web pages are large,</p>
<p>making it amazing to watch videos or read articles.</p>
<p>As you scroll down the page,</p>
<p>small text is crisp and easy to read at any angle.</p>
<p>And Safari expands so you can see all your open tabs.</p>
<p>You can arrange multiple apps around you in space however you want.</p>
<p>Layer them on top of each other, or place them above, below,</p>
<p>or to the sides of other apps.</p>
<p>Like here, where you simply turn your head</p>
<p>to change focus from Safari to work on your Freeform board.</p>
<p>And the content within your apps isn&rsquo;t limited to two dimensions.</p>
<p>You can receive a 3D object in Messages,</p>
<p>pull it out, and look at it from every angle,</p>
<p>just as if it was there in front of you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s magical!</p>
<p>Because you can see the world clearly while wearing Vision Pro,</p>
<p>you remain present in your space and connected to others.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s easy to interact with the world around you.</p>
<p>So with Apple Vision Pro,</p>
<p>you can create your perfect setup</p>
<p>for whatever you&rsquo;re doing, and multitask with ease.</p>
<p>You can review your to-do list in Notes,</p>
<p>research your next trip in Safari,</p>
<p>and discuss plans with friends in Messages,</p>
<p>all while listening to your favorite playlist in Apple Music.</p>
<p>Use the virtual keyboard or Dictation to type.</p>
<p>With Vision Pro, you have the room to do it all.</p>
<p>Vision Pro also works seamlessly with familiar Bluetooth accessories,</p>
<p>like Magic Trackpad and Magic Keyboard,</p>
<p>which are great when you&rsquo;re writing a long email</p>
<p>or working on a spreadsheet in Numbers.</p>
<p>And you can even bring your Mac wirelessly into Apple Vision Pro‚Äì</p>
<p>just by looking at it.</p>
<p>Place your Mac screen wherever you want and expand it‚Äì</p>
<p>giving you an enormous, private, and portable 4K display.</p>
<p>Vision Pro is engineered to let you use your Mac seamlessly</p>
<p>within your ideal workspace.</p>
<p>So you can dial in the White Sands Environment,</p>
<p>and use other apps in Vision Pro</p>
<p>side by side with your Mac.</p>
<p>This powerful combination of capabilities</p>
<p>makes Apple Vision Pro perfect for the office,</p>
<p>or for when you&rsquo;re working remote.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Because Vision Pro is great when you&rsquo;re traveling.</p>
<p>It makes it easy to stay connected and collaborate with colleagues.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p>you can collaborate remotely with your team on the same document.</p>
<p>And, of course, Apple Vision Pro has an amazing FaceTime experience.</p>
<p>FaceTime now becomes spatial,</p>
<p>taking advantage of the room around you.</p>
<p>You can join a group call and see everyone life-size.</p>
<p>As new people join, FaceTime simply expands.</p>
<p>With Spatial Audio built right into Vision Pro,</p>
<p>you hear each person&rsquo;s voice coming from the location of their tile,</p>
<p>making group conversations easier and more natural.</p>
<p>And within FaceTime, you can share apps with others,</p>
<p>and use them together with SharePlay.</p>
<p>And you continue to see everyone in large video tiles while sharing an app.</p>
<p>This is powerful for so many activities,</p>
<p>like reviewing a presentation,</p>
<p>sharing photos and videos, or watching a movie together.</p>
<p>FaceTime on Vision Pro works seamlessly with other Apple devices</p>
<p>like iPhone, iPad, and Mac,</p>
<p>so everyone can join in.</p>
<p>For work, Apple Vision Pro gives you powerful ways to connect with others</p>
<p>and the freedom to create the ultimate workspace</p>
<p>for whatever you want to do, wherever you are.</p>
<p>To tell you about how Vision Pro transforms experiences at home, here&rsquo;s En.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>En Kelly: Apple Vision Pro brings the power of spatial computing</p>
<p>to so many of the things you do at home.</p>
<p>It redefines how you can relive precious moments in time</p>
<p>because you can capture and experience photos and videos in magical new ways.</p>
<p>Select a photo, and watch as the room dims around you.</p>
<p>Your library of photos and videos looks incredible on Vision Pro</p>
<p>with brilliant color and spectacular detail.</p>
<p>Make it as big as your room, or zoom in,</p>
<p>letting you feel even closer to that moment.</p>
<p>And panoramas are stunning.</p>
<p>In Vision Pro, every panorama you&rsquo;ve ever taken on your iPhone</p>
<p>now expands and wraps around you life-size.</p>
<p>You feel like you&rsquo;re standing right where you took them.</p>
<p>Because of the powerful capabilities of Vision Pro,</p>
<p>we were able to go even further,</p>
<p>adding a new dimension to photos and videos.</p>
<p>Vision Pro is Apple&rsquo;s first 3D camera.</p>
<p>It lets you capture and relive your memories in 3D with Spatial Audio.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s magical, and impossible to fully appreciate on a two-dimensional screen.</p>
<p>It lets you feel like you&rsquo;re right back in a moment in time.</p>
<p>Imagine being able to relive a special moment from your daughter&rsquo;s birthday.</p>
<p>The incredible depth of this spatial video makes it feel like you can peer</p>
<p>into that memory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to capture a spatial photo or video</p>
<p>with just the press of a button.</p>
<p>And EyeSight makes it clear to those around you when you are capturing one.</p>
<p>You can capture a spatial video of a fun moment with your kids</p>
<p>to share it with your family,</p>
<p>or to experience all over again for years to come.</p>
<p>Spatial photos and videos bring you closer than ever</p>
<p>to the moments and people you care about.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Apple Vision Pro also delivers an extraordinary entertainment experience.</p>
<p>We love watching a great movie in a dark theater with incredible sound.</p>
<p>Vision Pro lets you have this, and so much more,</p>
<p>with a spatial cinema that transforms any space,</p>
<p>like this apartment.</p>
<p>You have a gorgeous screen you can adjust to the perfect size.</p>
<p>Vision Pro automatically dims the surrounding light,</p>
<p>casts a beautiful glow into your space,</p>
<p>and surrounds you with Spatial Audio.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>And for a super cinematic experience,</p>
<p>open an Environment like Mount Hood</p>
<p>to scale your screen beyond the dimensions of your room,</p>
<p>so it feels 100 feet wide‚Äì</p>
<p>giving you the most majestic viewing experience ever.</p>
<p>And with the Cinema Environment,</p>
<p>turn any room into your own personal movie theater.</p>
<p>This environment lets you focus fully on the movie,</p>
<p>and is built to give you a fantastic viewing experience</p>
<p>that you can take anywhere, like on an airplane.</p>
<p>Use your AirPods, sit back, and dial in an Environment,</p>
<p>and you can enjoy a movie while the seats and sounds around you disappear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>And of course, your favorite movies and TV shows from Apple TV+</p>
<p>and other content services will be available on Vision Pro.</p>
<p>This amazing cinematic experience goes beyond two dimensions.</p>
<p>You can watch 3D movies as well.</p>
<p>In Vision Pro, 3D Movies have incredible depth and crisp motion.</p>
<p>Although impossible to see on a 2D screen,</p>
<p>it feels as if you are looking right into the movie itself.</p>
<p>There is no other device in the world that can deliver this quality</p>
<p>of 3D Movie experience.</p>
<p>And beyond video,</p>
<p>you can experience interactive storytelling in amazing new ways.</p>
<p>Like with Encounter: Dinosaurs,</p>
<p>where you can look back into a prehistoric time</p>
<p>seeing dinosaurs interact right in front of you,</p>
<p>in 3D with Spatial Audio.</p>
<p>In addition to watching movies,</p>
<p>you can play your favorite Apple Arcade games,</p>
<p>like NBA 2K23, on a screen as large as you want</p>
<p>with incredible audio and game controller support.</p>
<p>There will be over 100 Arcade titles available for you to play on day one.</p>
<p>This is just the start of how gaming will evolve on Vision Pro.</p>
<p>Whether watching a season finale,</p>
<p>3D Movie, or Immersive Video,</p>
<p>Vision Pro is the best way to enjoy your favorite entertainment.</p>
<p>And with spatial photos and videos,</p>
<p>you can capture and relive cherished moments in magical new ways.</p>
<p>Now, back to Tim.</p>
<p>Tim: Apple Vision Pro will change the way we communicate, collaborate,</p>
<p>work, and enjoy entertainment.</p>
<p>And the Walt Disney Company is the world&rsquo;s leader in entertainment.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m thrilled to introduce Bob Iger, CEO of Disney.</p>
<p>Bob Iger: Thanks, Tim.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a privilege to be here with you for this momentous event.</p>
<p>As The Walt Disney Company celebrates our 100th anniversary,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re proudly reflecting on our rich legacy of innovation in storytelling</p>
<p>while also looking to our future with enthusiasm and optimism.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re constantly in search of new ways to entertain,</p>
<p>inform, and inspire our fans</p>
<p>by combining extraordinary creativity with groundbreaking technology</p>
<p>to create truly remarkable experiences,</p>
<p>and we believe Apple Vision Pro is a revolutionary platform</p>
<p>that can make our vision a reality.</p>
<p>The first time I tried Apple Vision Pro,</p>
<p>the thing that struck me the most was how it will allow us</p>
<p>to create deeply personal experiences</p>
<p>that bring our fans closer to the characters they love</p>
<p>and more deeply immersed in our stories.</p>
<p>This platform will allow us to bring Disney to our fans</p>
<p>in ways that were previously impossible.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re tremendously excited to give you a sneak peek</p>
<p>of just some of the things that we&rsquo;ve been dreaming up.</p>
<p>So take a look.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<ul>
<li>What if all the things that we thought were impossible</li>
</ul>
<p>were suddenly possible?</p>
<p>You could experience your favorite stories</p>
<p>in unexpected ways&hellip;</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>&hellip;or in unbelievable places.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>You could do more</p>
<p>than just watch sports.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Touchdown!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You could be at the game</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>without leaving your home.</p>
<p>Or be part of the action like never before.</p>
<p>What if you could travel</p>
<p>on a National Geographic adventure</p>
<p>from your couch?</p>
<p>Or if your imaginary friends&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Oh, boy!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weren&rsquo;t quite so&hellip;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>imaginary?</p>
<p>What if you could bring Disney World</p>
<p>into your world?</p>
<p>And what if you could become a super hero</p>
<p>and seek the answer to the ultimate question?</p>
<p>What if?</p>
<ul>
<li>Space,</li>
</ul>
<p>time,</p>
<p>reality‚Äì</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more than a linear path.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a prism of endless possibilities‚Äì</p>
<p>imperceptible to most,</p>
<p>but not to you.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Bob: We&rsquo;re so proud to yet again be partnering</p>
<p>the greatest storytelling company in the world</p>
<p>with the most innovative technology company in the world</p>
<p>to bring you real life magic.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m excited to announce that Disney+ will be available on day one.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the ways we can bring Disney into your world</p>
<p>with Apple Vision Pro,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re looking forward to sharing more in the coming months.</p>
<p>Thanks, Tim!</p>
<p>Tim: Thank you, Bob!</p>
<p>We are excited to work together to see all of the amazing things</p>
<p>Disney will do with the capabilities of Apple Vision Pro.</p>
<p>These groundbreaking innovations required remarkable breakthroughs</p>
<p>in design and technology.</p>
<p>To tell you about the incredible new design of Vision Pro, here&rsquo;s Richard.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Richard Howarth: It&rsquo;s not often we get the chance</p>
<p>to define an entirely new category‚Äì</p>
<p>to establish the principles that will influence the design for years to come.</p>
<p>Apple Vision Pro is the result of decades of our collective experience</p>
<p>designing high-performance products like Mac,</p>
<p>mobile products like iPhone,</p>
<p>and wearable products like Apple Watch.</p>
<p>All that learning has culminated in the most ambitious product</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve ever created.</p>
<p>To achieve our goals of performance, mobility, and wearability,</p>
<p>we utilized the most advanced, lightest-weight materials possible.</p>
<p>The entire front of the product is a singular piece</p>
<p>of three-dimensionally formed and laminated glass.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s polished to an optical surface</p>
<p>allowing it to act as a lens for EyeSight</p>
<p>and a wide array of cameras and sensors that need to have a view of the world.</p>
<p>The glass flows seamlessly into a lightweight frame</p>
<p>that houses a button to capture spatial photos and video,</p>
<p>and a Digital Crown that summons the Home View</p>
<p>and rotates to control immersion levels of Environments.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s machined from a custom aluminum alloy</p>
<p>that gently curves to wrap around your face.</p>
<p>This frame completes the form</p>
<p>and is the primary structural element of Vision Pro,</p>
<p>holding and protecting the components inside.</p>
<p>This surprisingly compact form</p>
<p>encapsulates an extraordinary amount of technology:</p>
<p>displays, cameras, sensors,</p>
<p>and even a high-performance computer,</p>
<p>all kept cool by an efficient thermal design</p>
<p>that quietly draws air through the system.</p>
<p>In contrast to the high-precision front of the product,</p>
<p>we created a rich combination of soft, textile parts</p>
<p>that provide comfort and wearability.</p>
<p>We studied thousands of heads to get a detailed understanding</p>
<p>of the huge variation in cheek width,</p>
<p>face angle, and head shape.</p>
<p>This led us to design a modular system</p>
<p>that allows us to tailor the product to fit you perfectly.</p>
<p>The LightSeal comes in a range of different shapes and sizes,</p>
<p>and flexes to conform to your face,</p>
<p>delivering a really precise fit.</p>
<p>Extending from the frame are flexible straps</p>
<p>that conform to the head,</p>
<p>ensuring the audio pods remain close to your ears.</p>
<p>They deliver rich Spatial Audio while keeping you aware of your surroundings.</p>
<p>The Head Band is 3D knitted as a single piece</p>
<p>to create a unique rib structure that provides cushioning,</p>
<p>breathability, and stretch.</p>
<p>The band attaches with a simple and secure mechanism,</p>
<p>allowing you to change it for a different size,</p>
<p>or even a different kind of band.</p>
<p>An easy-to-reach adjustment dial helps you secure the device comfortably,</p>
<p>and enables micro-adjustments during use.</p>
<p>For those who wear glasses,</p>
<p>we teamed up with Zeiss to create custom optical inserts</p>
<p>that magnetically attach to the lenses.</p>
<p>They accommodate a huge range of vision correction</p>
<p>without compromising display performance, or eye tracking accuracy.</p>
<p>Vision Pro supports all-day use when plugged in,</p>
<p>and up to two hours of use with the external, high-performance battery.</p>
<p>A separate battery means that you don&rsquo;t wear that weight on your head.</p>
<p>The soft aluminum form slips easily into your pocket,</p>
<p>and connects via a supple woven cable.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the design of Vision Pro,</p>
<p>our first-ever wearable, spatial computer.</p>
<p>An incredibly capable and powerful tool</p>
<p>that blends digital content with your world.</p>
<p>To tell you about the technology we developed</p>
<p>to enable these extraordinary experiences, here&rsquo;s Mike.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Mike Rockwell: Creating our first spatial computer required invention</p>
<p>across nearly every facet of the system.</p>
<p>Apple Vision Pro needed to deliver huge amounts of compute performance</p>
<p>in a compact, wearable form factor.</p>
<p>It needed an advanced, real-time sensor system,</p>
<p>as well as incredibly convincing Spatial Audio.</p>
<p>And of course, technological breakthroughs in displays.</p>
<p>Your eyes see the world with incredible resolution and color fidelity.</p>
<p>To give your eyes what they need,</p>
<p>we had to invent a display system with a huge number of pixels,</p>
<p>but in a small form factor.</p>
<p>A display where the pixels would disappear,</p>
<p>creating a smooth, continuous image.</p>
<p>It starts with a micro-OLED Apple silicon backplane</p>
<p>that fits 64 pixels in the space of a single iPhone pixel‚Äì</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just 7.5 microns wide.</p>
<p>Combined, Vision Pro has 23 million pixels across two panels</p>
<p>that are each just the size of a postage stamp.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more pixels than a 4K TV for each eye.</p>
<p>To magnify these panels and wrap them around you,</p>
<p>a sophisticated lens solution was needed.</p>
<p>We designed a custom three-element lens with incredible sharpness and clarity.</p>
<p>The result is a display that&rsquo;s everywhere you look,</p>
<p>delivering jaw-dropping experiences that are simply not possible</p>
<p>with any other device.</p>
<p>It enables video to be rendered at true 4K resolution,</p>
<p>with wide color and high dynamic range, all at massive scale.</p>
<p>And fine text looks super sharp from any angle.</p>
<p>This is critical for browsing the web, reading messages, and writing emails.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about audio.</p>
<p>What you hear is critical to how you perceive the world.</p>
<p>We wanted sound to feel like it was coming from the space around you,</p>
<p>blending with the real world.</p>
<p>So Vision Pro features an entirely new Spatial Audio system.</p>
<p>Personalized sound is delivered through the integrated dual-driver audio pods,</p>
<p>allowing us to create ambient Spatial Audio,</p>
<p>where your brain is totally convinced</p>
<p>that sounds are coming from the environment around you.</p>
<p>Beyond personalizing sound to you,</p>
<p>Vision Pro matches the sound to your room</p>
<p>by analyzing the features and materials of your space</p>
<p>using a technique called audio ray tracing.</p>
<p>Precisely matching sound to your room is just one example</p>
<p>of how Vision Pro makes use of its advanced sensor array.</p>
<p>This system also provides high-resolution video to the displays,</p>
<p>enables precise head and hand tracking,</p>
<p>performs real-time 3D mapping, and more.</p>
<p>A high-performance eye tracking system uses high-speed cameras</p>
<p>and a ring of LEDs that project invisible light patterns onto the eyes</p>
<p>for responsive, intuitive input.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so precise, it completely frees up your hands</p>
<p>from needing clumsy hardware controllers.</p>
<p>Processing all the information from these sensors,</p>
<p>while simultaneously delivering an ultra-high-resolution experience,</p>
<p>requires a system with massive sustained computational power.</p>
<p>It also has to remain cool and quiet.</p>
<p>At the foundation of this system is Apple silicon</p>
<p>in a unique dual-chip design.</p>
<p>It starts with the Apple M2 chip.</p>
<p>It delivers phenomenal compute performance</p>
<p>while allowing Vision Pro to maintain a comfortable temperature</p>
<p>and run virtually silent.</p>
<p>Running in parallel is a brand-new chip called R1.</p>
<p>This specialized chip was designed specifically</p>
<p>for the challenging task of real-time sensor processing.</p>
<p>It processes input from 12 cameras,</p>
<p>five sensors, and six microphones.</p>
<p>In other head-worn systems,</p>
<p>latency between sensors and displays can contribute to motion discomfort.</p>
<p>R1 virtually eliminates lag,</p>
<p>streaming new images to the displays within 12 milliseconds.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s eight times faster than the blink of an eye!</p>
<p>So while M2 ensures that Apple Vision Pro</p>
<p>delivers incredible standalone performance,</p>
<p>R1 ensures that experiences feel like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re taking place right in front of your eyes.</p>
<p>We also thought hard about how others can interact with you</p>
<p>while wearing Vision Pro.</p>
<p>EyeSight utilizes a unique curved OLED panel with a lenticular lens</p>
<p>to project the correct perspective of your eyes to each person looking at you.</p>
<p>The result is a 3D display that makes the device look transparent.</p>
<p>For digital communication like FaceTime,</p>
<p>Vision Pro goes beyond conveying just your eyes</p>
<p>and creates an authentic representation of you.</p>
<p>This was one of the most difficult challenges we faced</p>
<p>in building Apple Vision Pro.</p>
<p>There is no video conferencing camera looking at you,</p>
<p>and even if there were, you&rsquo;re wearing something over your eyes.</p>
<p>Using our most advanced machine learning techniques,</p>
<p>we created a novel solution.</p>
<p>After a quick enrollment process using the front sensors on Vision Pro,</p>
<p>the system uses an advanced encoder-decoder neural network</p>
<p>to create your digital Persona.</p>
<p>This network was trained on a diverse group of thousands of individuals.</p>
<p>It delivers a natural representation,</p>
<p>which dynamically matches your facial and hand movement.</p>
<p>With your Persona, you can communicate</p>
<p>with over a billion FaceTime-capable devices.</p>
<p>When viewed by someone in another Vision Pro,</p>
<p>your Persona has volume and depth not possible in traditional video.</p>
<p>None of this advanced technology could come to life</p>
<p>without a powerful operating system called visionOS.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s built on the foundation of the decades of engineering innovation</p>
<p>in macOS, iOS, and iPadOS.</p>
<p>To that foundation, we added a host of new capabilities</p>
<p>to support the low-latency requirements of spatial computing,</p>
<p>such as a new real-time execution engine</p>
<p>that guarantees performance-critical workloads,</p>
<p>a dynamically foveated rendering pipeline that delivers maximum image quality</p>
<p>to exactly where your eyes are looking for every single frame,</p>
<p>a first-of-its-kind multi-app 3D engine</p>
<p>that allows different apps to run simultaneously in the same simulation,</p>
<p>and importantly, the existing application frameworks</p>
<p>were extended to natively support spatial experiences.</p>
<p>vision OS is the first operating system designed from the ground up</p>
<p>for spatial computing.</p>
<p>All of the incredible innovations in Vision Pro</p>
<p>make it truly a one-of-a-kind device.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s simply nothing else like it.</p>
<p>Apple Vision Pro is more than just a new product.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the start of an entirely new platform.</p>
<p>To tell you more about what this means for developers, here&rsquo;s Susan.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Susan Prescott: We&rsquo;ve been preparing for this day for years,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re really excited about the possibilities</p>
<p>Vision Pro opens up for developers.</p>
<p>Vision Pro lets developers reimagine existing apps and create brand-new ones.</p>
<p>Spatial experiences can take many forms,</p>
<p>and can include 3D objects that look and feel real.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve given a few developers an early look at Vision Pro to see what they could do,</p>
<p>and they created some apps that are truly incredible.</p>
<p>Complete HeartX creates an interactive 3D beating heart,</p>
<p>giving students a whole new perspective on the body&rsquo;s most important function.</p>
<p>JigSpace lets designers collaborate to review a concept,</p>
<p>like the design of the Alfa Romeo F1 car.</p>
<p>And businesses can use Stages from PTC</p>
<p>to review and approve a new production line</p>
<p>before manufacturing begins.</p>
<p>Mix your favorite tracks with djay, with a reimagined spatial interface.</p>
<p>And with Sky Guide you are transported into your own personal planetarium,</p>
<p>with views you can&rsquo;t see with the naked eye.</p>
<p>And Vision Pro is amazing for everyday productivity too.</p>
<p>Microsoft apps like Excel, Word, and Teams</p>
<p>make full use of the expansive canvas</p>
<p>and sharp text rendering of Vision Pro.</p>
<p>And popular video conferencing apps can leverage your digital Persona</p>
<p>to make collaborating easy on this device.</p>
<p>And of course, our developer tools have been built with Vision Pro in mind.</p>
<p>Developers can use familiar tools and frameworks‚Äì</p>
<p>like Xcode, SwiftUI, RealityKit, and ARKit‚Äì</p>
<p>to make new apps for Vision Pro.</p>
<p>And to streamline the preparation of 3D content for spatial apps,</p>
<p>we built Reality Composer Pro,</p>
<p>which makes it easy to assemble complex scenes with realistic objects.</p>
<p>The same frameworks available in iPadOS and iOS are also included in visionOS.</p>
<p>This means hundreds of thousands of iPad and iPhone apps</p>
<p>will be available on Vision Pro at launch.</p>
<p>So you can use apps like Adobe Lightroom on a massive screen</p>
<p>and easily control these apps with just your eyes and hands.</p>
<p>We know there is a community of developers who have been building</p>
<p>incredible 3D apps for years.</p>
<p>And today, we are excited to share</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been working with Unity</p>
<p>to bring those apps to Vision Pro.</p>
<p>So popular Unity-based games and apps can gain full access to visionOS features</p>
<p>such as pass-through, high resolution rendering,</p>
<p>and native gestures.</p>
<p>And because these Unity apps are running natively on Apple Vision Pro,</p>
<p>they can sit side by side,</p>
<p>rendered simultaneously with other visionOS apps.</p>
<p>And Apple Vision Pro will have a brand-new App Store,</p>
<p>where users can discover and download all the apps built for visionOS,</p>
<p>as well as compatible iPad and iPhone apps.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll share more about our tools for developers</p>
<p>and everything they need to kickstart development this afternoon</p>
<p>in the Platforms State of the Union.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t wait to see what developers will do with this groundbreaking platform.</p>
<p>Now, back to Mike.</p>
<p>Mike: We&rsquo;ve been building towards this moment for years.</p>
<p>Our work together with Unity to deeply support their tools,</p>
<p>combined with the world class rendering of visionOS and powerful displays,</p>
<p>makes Apple Vision Pro an incredible platform for game developers.</p>
<p>Our amazing developer and app ecosystem is one of the reasons</p>
<p>people love their Apple products.</p>
<p>Another is the relentless focus we place on privacy and security.</p>
<p>And that starts the moment you put on Apple Vision Pro,</p>
<p>where it authenticates you with a secure, yet effortless system</p>
<p>called Optic ID.</p>
<p>This new system uses the uniqueness of your iris,</p>
<p>which is distinct, even with identical twins,</p>
<p>to instantly unlock Vision Pro.</p>
<p>Optic ID data is encrypted, never leaves your device,</p>
<p>and like Face ID, is only accessible to the Secure Enclave processor.</p>
<p>Optic ID works seamlessly with features like Apple Pay,</p>
<p>App Store purchase, and Password AutoFill.</p>
<p>We also engineered privacy into Vision Pro in some important ways.</p>
<p>For example, where you look is very personal.</p>
<p>It can give away something about what you&rsquo;re thinking.</p>
<p>In Apple Vision Pro, where you look stays private.</p>
<p>Eye input is isolated to a separate background process,</p>
<p>so apps and websites can&rsquo;t see where you are looking.</p>
<p>Only when you tap your fingers do results get communicated,</p>
<p>just like a mouse click or tap on other Apple devices.</p>
<p>And camera data is processed at the system level,</p>
<p>so individual apps don&rsquo;t need to see your surroundings.</p>
<p>You can enjoy the experiences in Vision Pro</p>
<p>knowing our world-class security and privacy features</p>
<p>are right there with you.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s Apple Vision Pro.</p>
<p>With the most advanced displays we&rsquo;ve ever made,</p>
<p>a revolutionary Spatial Audio system,</p>
<p>two powerful Apple silicon chips,</p>
<p>a groundbreaking spatial operating system,</p>
<p>and a gorgeous design made from aerospace-grade alloys,</p>
<p>Apple Vision Pro is the most advanced personal electronics device ever.</p>
<p>In fact, there is so much invention in Vision Pro</p>
<p>that we filed over 5,000 patents during its development.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe all the capabilities Vision Pro delivers</p>
<p>are possible in a standalone spatial computer</p>
<p>portable enough to use anywhere.</p>
<p>It lets you replace a desk full of monitors with infinite screen real estate,</p>
<p>so you can be more productive than ever.</p>
<p>It delivers stunning entertainment and Personalized Spatial Audio.</p>
<p>It provides powerful new ways to collaborate and stay connected.</p>
<p>And for capturing and reliving memories,</p>
<p>Vision Pro is simply in a class of its own.</p>
<p>If you purchased a new state-of-the-art TV,</p>
<p>surround sound system,</p>
<p>powerful computer with multiple high-definition displays,</p>
<p>high-end camera, and more,</p>
<p>you still would not have come close to what Vision Pro delivers.</p>
<p>Apple Vision Pro starts at $3499.</p>
<p>It will be available early next year on apple.com</p>
<p>and at Apple retail stores in the US,</p>
<p>with more countries coming later next year.</p>
<p>WWDC provides the ideal time to share in-depth information</p>
<p>about this incredible new platform with developers.</p>
<p>And we will work with them over the coming months</p>
<p>to create new and innovative apps for the launch of Vision Pro and beyond.</p>
<p>And the Apple Store was built for moments like this.</p>
<p>You will be able to engage with our team to learn more about this new platform,</p>
<p>get a demo, and personalize your fit for Vision Pro.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t wait for you to experience Apple Vision Pro.</p>
<p>Now, back to Tim.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Oh, hold it till it goes by ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Tim: Thank you, Mike, and thanks to all of our presenters.</p>
<p>And a big thanks to everyone at Apple who made today possible.</p>
<p>This has been a huge day.</p>
<p>We introduced the all-new 15-inch MacBook Air,</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s best 15-inch notebook,</p>
<p>as well as the two most powerful Macs we&rsquo;ve ever made,</p>
<p>Mac Studio and Mac Pro‚Äì</p>
<p>all of them powered by Apple silicon.</p>
<p>And we showed you where we&rsquo;re taking our amazing software platforms:</p>
<p>iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS</p>
<p>and the software that powers home and audio.</p>
<p>And of course, we announced Apple Vision Pro.</p>
<p>There are certain products that shift the way we look at technology</p>
<p>and the role it plays in our lives.</p>
<p>We believe Apple Vision Pro is a revolutionary product‚Äì</p>
