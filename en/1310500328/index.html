    <p>you could be the seventh best player in the whole world,</p>
<p>like literally seventh best player.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re playing with the other six, you&rsquo;re the sucker.</p>
<p>You are like the worst player in the game, right?</p>
<p>So like there&rsquo;s a lot of players, for example,</p>
<p>like the Dan Blazarians of the world, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not a top level player,</p>
<p>like these guys you see on TV,</p>
<p>but he probably makes more money than they do</p>
<p>because he plays with people</p>
<p>that are far below his skill level.</p>
<p>So part of the skill of being a poker player</p>
<p>is finding situations where you&rsquo;re profitable,</p>
<p>regardless of your skill level.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Daniel Negrano,</p>
<p>one of the greatest poker players of all time.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Daniel Negrano.</p>
<p>Everything everyone does at the poker table</p>
<p>conveys information.</p>
<p>So let me ask sort of the big overview question.</p>
<p>What are the various sources of information</p>
<p>that you project and others project at the table</p>
<p>that convey information?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s several different things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the ones that are conscious</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the ones that are subconscious, right?</p>
<p>Like on the conscious level,</p>
<p>it might be something someone says, right?</p>
<p>You know, you ask them a question and they say,</p>
<p>oh, you know, you shouldn&rsquo;t call me here, you should.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the verbal tells.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the more, you know, subconscious stuff,</p>
<p>body posture, right?</p>
<p>The eyes, the throat, the pulse,</p>
<p>various things that are, you know, less controllable.</p>
<p>I find I use a combination of both</p>
<p>to try to gain information,</p>
<p>but generally when I have somebody more comfortable,</p>
<p>they give off more.</p>
<p>Like everyone has a different approach.</p>
<p>Phil Ivey likes to intimidate.</p>
<p>I go the other way.</p>
<p>I want my opponents to be relaxed</p>
<p>so that they&rsquo;ll give me more in that regard.</p>
<p>So Phil Ivey likes to perturb the system,</p>
<p>like mess with it to see what comes out.</p>
<p>I think Phil has an aura about him</p>
<p>where he wants you to know that he&rsquo;s watching you,</p>
<p>be afraid, be uncomfortable,</p>
<p>because when you&rsquo;re uncomfortable, I got you, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s sort of his shtick where he, you know,</p>
<p>and people do, like when you sit at a table with Phil Ivey,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s intimidating.</p>
<p>He likes to rule by fear</p>
<p>and you like to rule by, what is it, love?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really good way to put it.</p>
<p>I never had anyone put it like that,</p>
<p>but it makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, fear Phil Ivey,</p>
<p>and then with me, it&rsquo;s fine, don&rsquo;t worry,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take your money, but you&rsquo;re gonna enjoy it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what the talking at the table is about,</p>
<p>is getting to be relaxed and get some of that gray area</p>
<p>between the conscious and the subconscious</p>
<p>to reveal something.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s that too, and also just, you know,</p>
<p>and this is just part of who I am anyway,</p>
<p>like I like to talk to people,</p>
<p>but one of the byproducts is the more I know about you,</p>
<p>the more I likely know about how you think</p>
<p>about different situations, right?</p>
<p>So what do you do for a living?</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m a lawyer, I defend criminals.</p>
<p>Okay, so this guy probably spends a lot of his time</p>
<p>twisting the truth, trying to find, you know,</p>
<p>and then, so then, you know, you already have a mindset</p>
<p>of like, this guy might be more likely to bluff</p>
<p>or he&rsquo;s probably comfortable doing that.</p>
<p>Very subtle things like that.</p>
<p>And you start to pick up cues on what nervousness looks like</p>
<p>for this person, what the nervousness communicates,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about physical tells here.</p>
<p>Yeah, physical tells is a secondary thing.</p>
<p>I was more specific like player profiling, right?</p>
<p>And sort of understanding the type of mind</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m dealing with, right?</p>
<p>So again, somebody who&rsquo;s a lawyer is used to trying,</p>
<p>is fine with being deceptive as part of a game, right?</p>
<p>Whereas maybe somebody who&rsquo;s a Sunday school teacher</p>
<p>and, you know, they don&rsquo;t feel comfortable,</p>
<p>maybe they think bluffing might be dishonest, right?</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re less likely to try some shenanigans against you.</p>
<p>So, and then the other thing too is,</p>
<p>what type of person is this in terms of their, you know,</p>
<p>like view on life, right?</p>
<p>Are they positive?</p>
<p>Do they feel like things go their way or they&rsquo;re not, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s those people that always, well, of course I lost,</p>
<p>I always lose with this hand.</p>
<p>And those types of people you can manipulate</p>
<p>because when a card comes,</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t have them beat, right?</p>
<p>But you can pretend because they&rsquo;ll believe it.</p>
<p>Like, of course you beat me.</p>
<p>So you bet all your chips against them,</p>
<p>knowing that you can scare them</p>
<p>because they already feel like they&rsquo;re gonna lose.</p>
<p>The inherent, like the cynicism.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Cynicism is easier to play against</p>
<p>because you can convince them that their cards suck.</p>
<p>Yeah, when somebody believes that they&rsquo;re a loser</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re unlucky, right?</p>
<p>And that bad things happen to them always</p>
<p>and they never catch a break.</p>
<p>Well, you know, you can just help them make it true.</p>
<p>What do you think about the rounders Teddy KGB</p>
<p>when he does the Oreo tell?</p>
<p>Do players at the high level communicate that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s realistic to be able to have a tell</p>
<p>like this that&rsquo;s partially subconscious?</p>
<p>So first of all, I love Brian Koppelman who made the film.</p>
<p>And I think what they were going for</p>
<p>is something obvious to the general public, right?</p>
<p>Like, okay, it&rsquo;s very clear, you know, he eats the cookie,</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t eat the cookie and it means one or the other.</p>
<p>At the highest levels, something that, you know, blatant,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna find.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna find a lot more subtle things,</p>
<p>maybe with posture or timing or, you know,</p>
<p>different things like that.</p>
<p>But at the lower levels, you know, you might see some,</p>
<p>you might see, you know, with a lot of people</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re in a hand and they&rsquo;ve bet,</p>
<p>whether they drink water in the hand</p>
<p>is going to tell you something generally speaking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such an intimate part of the human experience</p>
<p>that I feel like if you have food,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna reveal something about yourself</p>
<p>through the way you eat.</p>
<p>I feel like that&rsquo;s a dangerous thing</p>
<p>to have at the table.</p>
<p>Well, the thing is, generally speaking,</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t eat food in the middle of a hand.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re not gonna bet and then just like grab a burger.</p>
<p>What they will do though is, you know,</p>
<p>they bet and it&rsquo;s up to you and then they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re, you know, uncomfortable</p>
<p>or they do it unconsciously,</p>
<p>they just want to do something</p>
<p>to make themselves look relaxed or whatever.</p>
<p>And then, you know, they grab a water</p>
<p>where they don&rsquo;t really need it in that moment,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re trying to take your mind off of the situation.</p>
<p>So they, in the movie, wanted to show a simplistic version</p>
<p>of something that does happen,</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s visually sort of clear.</p>
<p>Yeah, because I think one of the things Rounders got right</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s a poker movie, right?</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t have to be great at poker</p>
<p>or really understand poker to enjoy the movie.</p>
<p>And that, you know, Oreo cookie tale,</p>
<p>like everyone gets that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, okay, that&rsquo;s simple.</p>
<p>If he would have went with something more subtle,</p>
<p>you know, like licking your lips or looking to the right,</p>
<p>or I think it might&rsquo;ve been lost on the audience.</p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t actually explicitly say</p>
<p>that that was a tell, I don&rsquo;t think.</p>
<p>I thought they did everything to let you know, right?</p>
<p>With the music and slow motion and he&rsquo;s staring at it</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like, aha.</p>
<p>Yeah, but they didn&rsquo;t actually say,</p>
<p>you know, this is an obvious tell,</p>
<p>like Matt Damon&rsquo;s character didn&rsquo;t talk.</p>
<p>At the very end of it, you know,</p>
<p>after he says, how the fuck did you lay that down?</p>
<p>The monster, right?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, he&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re not hungry?</p>
<p>Not hungry, KGB?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I keep on, but you, you know,</p>
<p>so he sort of references it and then he takes the cookies.</p>
<p>He notices, he&rsquo;s like, ah, he got me.</p>
<p>And he breaks the, you know, the rack of cookies.</p>
<p>Well, probably if you had that kind of tell on him,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t, and Matt Damon&rsquo;s character would not reveal.</p>
<p>Well, he says in the movie, he says,</p>
<p>normally I wouldn&rsquo;t reveal a tell,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t have that much time.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve got to rattle him some way.</p>
<p>So that was one way to do that.</p>
<p>How hard is it to do that to, in a KGB accent,</p>
<p>to lay down a monster in those situations?</p>
<p>In general, how hard is it to lay down</p>
<p>a really strong hand, just psychologically?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I mean, I think it&rsquo;s incredibly difficult</p>
<p>for the vast majority of people.</p>
<p>You know, part of what makes professionals</p>
<p>really, really good is recognizing a situation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very, very dangerous and they need to, you know,</p>
<p>jump ship.</p>
<p>Like what happens to a lot of players</p>
<p>is you get married to a hand.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you have pocket aces,</p>
<p>which is the best possible hand, right?</p>
<p>But the board runs out where it&rsquo;s seven, eight, nine,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a jack and then there&rsquo;s a six.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you have a great hand to start,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t anymore.</p>
<p>So one of the difficult things for the average player is,</p>
<p>you know, once they&rsquo;ve put money in, cutting their losses</p>
<p>and saying, okay, let&rsquo;s move on to the next hand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very, very difficult thing for a lot of people.</p>
<p>At every stage of like pre flop all the way through,</p>
<p>be able to just make a decision at that moment.</p>
<p>So yeah, essentially not being attached.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ve already put in $40,000 in this pot</p>
<p>and this guy&rsquo;s bet another 20.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I gotta get my 40 back, right?</p>
<p>Except, you know, in some cases you have to reassess</p>
<p>individually this situation and realize,</p>
<p>all right, well, this is a bad investment.</p>
<p>So I got to cut my losses.</p>
<p>By the way, I should mention that you have,</p>
<p>you have an incredible YouTube channel</p>
<p>where you explain a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>You do a podcast, you do a lot of really awesome stuff.</p>
<p>My probably favorite thing that you&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>is your masterclass that people should definitely check out,</p>
<p>masterclass.com slash Lux.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>No, but it really is one of my favorite masterclass courses,</p>
<p>but also just a great introduction overview of poker.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great for people like me who are beginners essentially,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s probably really good for intermediate people too.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of really good detail there.</p>
<p>Anyway, what are hand ranges</p>
<p>and how do you begin to estimate the range of hands</p>
<p>that your opponents have?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I actually did, speaking to YouTube,</p>
<p>I did a video on specifically this.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Getting familiar with Rangers and essentially,</p>
<p>you know, back in my day, the old days,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t talk about poker that way.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like, I think he&rsquo;s got this</p>
<p>or I think he&rsquo;s got that, right?</p>
<p>Nobody thought of like the range of hands</p>
<p>a player can have.</p>
<p>So I guess the best example is,</p>
<p>imagine like all the potential hands</p>
<p>as being a part of a grid, right?</p>
<p>So the first player to act,</p>
<p>they could have any one of those hands, right?</p>
<p>Anyone randomly dealt, right?</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say now that that player raised to $3,000.</p>
<p>Okay, well you can eliminate now from this grid,</p>
<p>a whole bunch of hands that this player can no longer have</p>
<p>because if they had a two and a three,</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>So you can say, okay, he probably has a big pair.</p>
<p>He has ace king.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;ve narrowed the range of hands down, right?</p>
<p>Now through every action on the flop,</p>
<p>on the turn and on the river,</p>
<p>based on the decisions they make,</p>
<p>you narrow it down even further.</p>
<p>So the range of hands is the whole,</p>
<p>the entirety of all the possibilities</p>
<p>that this player you believe could have.</p>
<p>And sometimes they fool you</p>
<p>or they have a hand that you don&rsquo;t expect them</p>
<p>to have in their range.</p>
<p>And you know, maybe a little bit unorthodox</p>
<p>doing some things you don&rsquo;t expect to throw you off,</p>
<p>but a range is essentially all the possibilities</p>
<p>and it narrows as by the time,</p>
<p>before the flop it&rsquo;s endless,</p>
<p>player raises, okay, it&rsquo;s minimized.</p>
<p>You know, a player bets the flop,</p>
<p>okay, it&rsquo;s minimized further.</p>
<p>And then by the river, you know,</p>
<p>you can narrow down the entire range to, you know,</p>
<p>just maybe even a few hands.</p>
<p>Is it always shrinking or is there sort of,</p>
<p>as you get surprised?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s always just an estimate.</p>
<p>So does it ever expand based on sort of chaotic,</p>
<p>unpredicted surprising behavior of the players?</p>
<p>It really should never expand.</p>
<p>The range of hands should always get smaller, right?</p>
<p>Like again, we start with the full scope</p>
<p>and then you should factor in like, okay,</p>
<p>these are all the possible hands</p>
<p>you can have on the flop now, right?</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t have new hands on the turn.</p>
<p>And if you get to that point where you think,</p>
<p>oh, well, maybe he has this hand,</p>
<p>then you sort of misjudged his range prior.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not thinking clearly.</p>
<p>It should always shrink from the full scope to, you know,</p>
<p>hopefully just a couple.</p>
<p>Well, in that video, you also talk about,</p>
<p>it used to be that you would play your hand,</p>
<p>but now you&rsquo;re playing a range</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re representing a range.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not even just playing your hand.</p>
<p>So what does it mean to represent a certain range?</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s another big thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s different about poker from, you know,</p>
<p>my day to today is that back in our day,</p>
<p>we would like put people on one hand.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you probably have king nine</p>
<p>or you have jacks or something like that.</p>
<p>Now people are cognizant of the idea</p>
<p>that you could have an entire range of hands.</p>
<p>So then you ask yourself in situations,</p>
<p>all right, I know what I have,</p>
<p>but what I could have in his mind</p>
<p>or my opponent&rsquo;s mind is any one of these hands.</p>
<p>What would I do with the entirety of these hands?</p>
<p>And so a lot of people that are trying to play optimally,</p>
<p>you know, game theory optimal,</p>
<p>they think in terms of what their range of hands would do</p>
<p>rather than their very specific hand.</p>
<p>So is bluffing in that context</p>
<p>essentially misrepresenting the range of hands that you have?</p>
<p>No. Is that how you think about it?</p>
<p>Not exactly, because so an optimal range,</p>
<p>like if I bet the river,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m playing game theory optimal,</p>
<p>a portion of my range is going to be, I have it.</p>
<p>I got the best hand.</p>
<p>And a portion of my range is going to be bluffs</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll be balanced.</p>
<p>So in theory, no matter what you do,</p>
<p>no matter what you do, if you call or you fold,</p>
<p>in theory, it&rsquo;s just, you&rsquo;re printing a zero, as we say,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gaining or losing any EV,</p>
<p>if you were to do it that way.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s EV?</p>
<p>EV is expected value, right?</p>
<p>So every play that you make,</p>
<p>you know, it either is going to in the long run,</p>
<p>you know, make you some money,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s just a losing play.</p>
<p>And as a professional,</p>
<p>you try to make the fewest amount of minus EV plays you can.</p>
<p>And the only reason you would make these minus EV plays</p>
<p>is potentially if you were trying to set up your opponent</p>
<p>for something later, right?</p>
<p>So I might make some minus EV plays, right?</p>
<p>So that I can exploit you later, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re building up an image,</p>
<p>a player profile that&rsquo;s false in some way.</p>
<p>Something that I&rsquo;m going to,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to plant seeds in your mind</p>
<p>so that I can exploit them later.</p>
<p>So for example, why would players like show a big bluff?</p>
<p>Like what would be the reason for that?</p>
<p>They show a big bluff</p>
<p>so that you know that they&rsquo;re capable of it.</p>
<p>But maybe in their mind,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re never going to do that again.</p>
<p>But now they think, you know, he bluffed me last time.</p>
<p>Maybe he&rsquo;s doing it again.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a, what we call like a level, a leveling war.</p>
<p>Because it, you know, you can go back and forth</p>
<p>with whether or not, okay, this guy might know that.</p>
<p>Like he showed a bluff</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s never going to bluff me again.</p>
<p>So that that&rsquo;s where it gets a little.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a little bit different.</p>
<p>The, when we&rsquo;re talking about hand rangers,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s different than building up a mental model</p>
<p>of what your opponents,</p>
<p>what your opponents think of you</p>
<p>and what your opponents think that you think of them</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Are you trying to construct those kinds of mental models?</p>
<p>And is that separate from the hand rangers?</p>
<p>They go hand in hand, right?</p>
<p>So if any given, in a given situation, right?</p>
<p>My range has this many value hands and this many bluffs.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>So in theory, if I want to be balanced, you know,</p>
<p>this is my range and this is what it looks like.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet this 50% of the time, bet this 50% of the time.</p>
<p>However, if I know that you think that I bluff too much,</p>
<p>right, then I&rsquo;m not going to bluff as much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to start,</p>
<p>instead of betting these hands that I would 50, 50,</p>
<p>now what I&rsquo;ll do is I&rsquo;ll do like 70, 30,</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m basically value betting</p>
<p>most of the time against you, you know, or vice versa.</p>
<p>If I know you always fold because you think I have it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to veer the other way.</p>
<p>And instead of bluffing 50%,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bluff 70, 80% of the time</p>
<p>to take advantage of your perception of me.</p>
<p>So to be successful,</p>
<p>do you have to construct a solid model of all the players</p>
<p>in the game or can you ignore them?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>Like when I play, I have in my phone,</p>
<p>I have a player profile of everyone that I play with.</p>
<p>Whenever I pick up, whether it&rsquo;s physical tells</p>
<p>or tendencies they like to, you know, that they have.</p>
<p>And overall, that&rsquo;s just going to, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to allow you to exploit more, right?</p>
<p>So like if I played with somebody I&rsquo;ve never played before,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably just going to play optimally</p>
<p>or at least as optimal as I know how until I start to,</p>
<p>you know, gain some information on that player</p>
<p>so that I can start to exploit them.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the, when you say optimally,</p>
<p>what does optimally mean versus,</p>
<p>so game theory optimal versus exploitative?</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s like sort of the big debate in poker.</p>
<p>We call it for short,</p>
<p>GTO game theory optimal versus exploitative play.</p>
<p>So GTO game theory optimal is the idea that no,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m going to set up my play</p>
<p>so that no matter what you do, you cannot exploit me.</p>
<p>So essentially that&rsquo;s playing rock, paper, scissors, right?</p>
<p>And throwing 33% of each every time, right?</p>
<p>Nothing you do can beat that, nothing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll never be able to beat that, right?</p>
<p>Exploitative play is starting to notice that, okay,</p>
<p>well, you know what?</p>
<p>This guy loves rock.</p>
<p>He loves playing rock.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to go paper a little more.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to take advantage of them.</p>
<p>So I won&rsquo;t be through, but now all of a sudden,</p>
<p>when I do that, I&rsquo;m no longer playing optimal</p>
<p>because if you knew that I was making that adjustment,</p>
<p>now you can exploit me.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where the sort of what we call</p>
<p>the leveling war happens, where people veer from,</p>
<p>you know, the optimal line of, okay, 33% each for each one.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t beat that, but you also can&rsquo;t win with that either.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re always trying to be at the cutting,</p>
<p>at the leading edge of suboptimal play.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re going back and forth.</p>
<p>And listen, at the highest levels,</p>
<p>like online that these guys play,</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re trying to play pretty close</p>
<p>to like game theory optimal</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very difficult to do first of all.</p>
<p>No human being will ever be able to compute</p>
<p>at the level that computers can.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just never going to happen.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where like the human mind has to come into play</p>
<p>and say, all right, well, you know,</p>
<p>if I was playing against the robot, I would do X,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m playing against you.</p>
<p>So I have to adjust.</p>
<p>So does game theory optimal only look at the betting</p>
<p>and the hands in the current hand</p>
<p>or does it look at the history?</p>
<p>So if you were to play optimally, optimally,</p>
<p>would you need to look at the history</p>
<p>of the individual players</p>
<p>or just every hand is taken afresh?</p>
<p>See, that&rsquo;s why I love playing exploitatively</p>
<p>for the most part, because with GTO,</p>
<p>anything that&rsquo;s happened in the past</p>
<p>has no bearing on this situation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simply based on what is the optimal play</p>
<p>in a vacuum in this spot.</p>
<p>Whereas exploitatively, okay,</p>
<p>this guy bluffs way too much in these spots.</p>
<p>So now I can make an adjustment and call more, you know,</p>
<p>based on past information.</p>
<p>GTO doesn&rsquo;t take into account history at all.</p>
<p>So like in a tournament,</p>
<p>how quickly can you construct a player profile</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve never played before?</p>
<p>Depends on the level of the buy in really, right?</p>
<p>So the higher the buy in, generally speaking,</p>
<p>you can assume if they&rsquo;re professionals,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re gonna have pretty similar profiles</p>
<p>because you know, everyone&rsquo;s playing,</p>
<p>you know, if you&rsquo;re playing this game well,</p>
<p>it looks similar, right?</p>
<p>At the lower levels, you know,</p>
<p>playing say in $1,000 or $1,500 buy in or less,</p>
<p>you know, within a half an hour or an hour,</p>
<p>I have an idea of all right,</p>
<p>just by seeing how some players played a few hands that,</p>
<p>you know, so here&rsquo;s the thing with poker,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, I can see one clue of what he did.</p>
<p>And it tells me so much about what he&rsquo;ll do</p>
<p>in a vast number of scenarios.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying at the high level,</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t give too many clues.</p>
<p>I mean, then.</p>
<p>Well, at the highest level is,</p>
<p>people are so much more similar</p>
<p>in terms of their style of play.</p>
<p>They try to find some kind of balance between the GTO.</p>
<p>And now with all that we&rsquo;ve seen on TV, right?</p>
<p>Like people get to watch streams and whatever.</p>
<p>So you get to watch all the top players play.</p>
<p>So if you wanna learn how to play better,</p>
<p>guess what you do?</p>
<p>You copy what they&rsquo;re doing, essentially.</p>
<p>Like, oh, he&rsquo;s only raising this much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do the same.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re betting this much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do the same.</p>
<p>So as a result,</p>
<p>what you end up having is sort of,</p>
<p>you know, everyone deciding.</p>
<p>Like, I guess it&rsquo;s similar in chess with openings, right?</p>
<p>People figure out, okay, this is an opening.</p>
<p>This is what you do.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it, you know?</p>
<p>And then everyone&rsquo;s similar to that.</p>
<p>And then you have, of course, the outliers</p>
<p>who try to do things a little differently</p>
<p>and confuse people.</p>
<p>It seems like the outliers,</p>
<p>like we talked offline that Magnus,</p>
<p>in order to win Magnus Carlsen,</p>
<p>has to play suboptimally in the openings</p>
<p>to take his opponents out of the comfort zone</p>
<p>so he can play what he calls pure chess</p>
<p>as quickly as possible,</p>
<p>which is just both short and deep calculations.</p>
<p>Purely, you&rsquo;re looking at the board</p>
<p>versus memorized openings and memorized lines.</p>
<p>Is it the case that the best poker players</p>
<p>are the ones that are able to, at the right time,</p>
<p>play really suboptimally or really unorthodox?</p>
<p>Yeah, specifically there&rsquo;s one guy</p>
<p>who last year sort of took the poker world by storm,</p>
<p>and his name was Michael Adamo.</p>
<p>And he was doing things, like I said,</p>
<p>you know, most of the top pros play very similarly</p>
<p>with the way that they construct ranges</p>
<p>and their bet sizing and all these kinds of things.</p>
<p>He was doing some crazy things</p>
<p>that nobody else was doing.</p>
<p>So he studied sort of a different form of poker</p>
<p>and it was unorthodox.</p>
<p>And it, you know, it throws people off</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s in his comfort zone</p>
<p>with these bet sizes and different things,</p>
<p>whereas everyone else,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not well studied in those spots.</p>
<p>So as a result of him being unorthodox,</p>
<p>he became like a monster and very difficult to play against</p>
<p>because he really knew what he was doing with it.</p>
<p>In tournament or cash games?</p>
<p>It was tournaments, yeah.</p>
<p>He was crushing tournaments.</p>
<p>He was going against the norm</p>
<p>in terms of what is like, you know,</p>
<p>this is what you should do as a poker player in this spot.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t doing that.</p>
<p>He was doing what he thought was best</p>
<p>and he was doing things outside the norm</p>
<p>that again, in a vacuum, you could look at that</p>
<p>and you go, that&rsquo;s incorrect.</p>
<p>That he should not do.</p>
<p>That is a clear cut mistake.</p>
<p>Even, you know, the solvers or the computers</p>
<p>or game theory would say, this is wrong what he&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not wrong if he&rsquo;s doing it in a way</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s exploiting other players tendencies.</p>
<p>So for example, with him,</p>
<p>say he&rsquo;s playing far too aggressively, okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not good unless your opponents</p>
<p>are playing way too passively.</p>
<p>So if your opponents are playing passively,</p>
<p>the answer is to be more aggressive with them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I think one of the, you know,</p>
<p>biggest advantages he had was he was willing to do that.</p>
<p>So bet huge, big, big pots bluffing.</p>
<p>Huge.</p>
<p>So in a spot where somebody would make it a thousand,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s making it 22,000.</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>This makes no sense.</p>
<p>And then people kind of know he has nothing,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re too afraid to call him on it.</p>
<p>Well, and then sometimes what happens is</p>
<p>this is where the leveling comes in.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, man, this guy&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s bluffing like nuts.</p>
<p>Then he bets the 22,000 and you say,</p>
<p>ah, I&rsquo;m taking my stand.</p>
<p>I call, and then he shows you like, you know,</p>
<p>four of a kind or something like that.</p>
<p>So he gets people out of their comfort zone.</p>
<p>And I really enjoy watching him play.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s probably my favorite player to watch today.</p>
<p>Watching a guy like that,</p>
<p>what aspect of his play have you been able</p>
<p>to incorporate into your own?</p>
<p>Like, what do you learn from that?</p>
<p>Cause you&rsquo;re constantly learning,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re constantly adjusting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, no, and I love it.</p>
<p>And as I said, so I think a lot of players</p>
<p>sort of come to the same conclusions about</p>
<p>this is how you play the spot, but he doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I love watching and thinking in terms of like,</p>
<p>why he&rsquo;s doing this.</p>
<p>And one specific thing, for example,</p>
<p>is he&rsquo;s willing to really go for it.</p>
<p>So in a spot where let&rsquo;s say he bets 2000,</p>
<p>he knows he&rsquo;ll get you to call 2000, right?</p>
<p>But he wants it all.</p>
<p>He wants it all.</p>
<p>So he says, you know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give up the 2000 that&rsquo;s guaranteed</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll bet 50,000.</p>
<p>And maybe if you call that now, you know,</p>
<p>so listen, you lose the 2007, eight times,</p>
<p>but if I get called for the 50 just once,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m profiting from that.</p>
<p>And it also sets the, you know, the template for you</p>
<p>to really sort of be a player</p>
<p>that people are afraid to play against.</p>
<p>He knocked me out in a tournament very early on</p>
<p>in a huge event.</p>
<p>And he had, he was so far ahead.</p>
<p>He was one step ahead of my thought process in hand.</p>
<p>And he did something that makes no sense whatsoever.</p>
<p>I looked it up on the computer.</p>
<p>Huge mistake, if you will, but not a mistake</p>
<p>because he was taking advantage of my tendency.</p>
<p>Do you remember the cars?</p>
<p>Is there an example?</p>
<p>I remember the whole thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I remember it like it was yesterday.</p>
<p>Can you take it like through an example hand</p>
<p>that really demonstrates it?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll explain the hand here.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m on the button and I have ace king,</p>
<p>which is a very good hand.</p>
<p>And I raise and he calls from the big blind.</p>
<p>The flop is nine, seven, five.</p>
<p>So I have nothing really here.</p>
<p>He checks, I check behind.</p>
<p>The turn card&rsquo;s an ace.</p>
<p>He checks, I bet half the pot.</p>
<p>There were 6,000 there, I bet 3,000, okay?</p>
<p>Now this is not a typical thing you see people do,</p>
<p>but he raised me to 36,000.</p>
<p>Massive raise, bigger than the size of the pot.</p>
<p>What was the flop again?</p>
<p>Nine, seven, five, turn an ace.</p>
<p>What is he representing exactly?</p>
<p>Well, he could have a straight,</p>
<p>he could have three, three of a kind.</p>
<p>He could have, you know, aces up.</p>
<p>He could have a whole bunch of hands.</p>
<p>So he check raises me big to 36,000.</p>
<p>I call the bet.</p>
<p>So now there&rsquo;s something like 75,000.</p>
<p>The river is a five.</p>
<p>So the board pairs, okay?</p>
<p>He thinks for a while and he bets all of it,</p>
<p>which is three times the pot.</p>
<p>He bets 225,000.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only 75,000 out there, right?</p>
<p>And in theory, he should never ever have a hand</p>
<p>that can do that, right?</p>
<p>So it confused me.</p>
<p>And I was like, okay, well, this guy&rsquo;s aggressive.</p>
<p>He likes to bluff and all this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So I made the call with the ace king</p>
<p>and he turned over six, eight.</p>
<p>So we had a straight, but here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>In theory, that river card is bad for him.</p>
<p>When I call the turn, I have a lot of the time,</p>
<p>three of a kind, two pair that just made a full house.</p>
<p>So he was risking that.</p>
<p>And the reason he did it was</p>
<p>because he thought I would perceive him to be bluffing a lot.</p>
<p>So he just went for it and it worked.</p>
<p>He was able to double up right away</p>
<p>and knock me out of the tournament like an hour in.</p>
<p>Do you think he thought you might fold?</p>
<p>Like what is it?</p>
<p>I think specific, I think it was, it came down to this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as simple as this.</p>
<p>He was cognizant of his image</p>
<p>as being a wild, aggressive bluffer, right?</p>
<p>And he was fully taking advantage of me,</p>
<p>knowing that my tendency in these spots is to be curious.</p>
<p>And I want to call and I want to see it.</p>
<p>So he was fully taking advantage of the fact</p>
<p>that he thought I would call too often.</p>
<p>Because otherwise his play makes no sense.</p>
<p>A small bet, a medium sized bet, those make sense.</p>
<p>But the bet that he made in theory is indefensible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like clearly a mistake.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s why poker is so fascinating</p>
<p>because he makes this play and it wasn&rsquo;t a mistake.</p>
<p>It was above the rim, is what it was.</p>
<p>Do you think he put you on ace something?</p>
<p>I think exactly what he thought I had,</p>
<p>was ace king or something like that.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>That is so fun.</p>
<p>That is so fun that the two players at such a high level</p>
<p>were able to mess with each other&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>How old is he?</p>
<p>Is he young?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in his 20s, yeah.</p>
<p>I feel like that takes a lot of guts</p>
<p>to take risks like that.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s great about him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s certainly never accused</p>
<p>of not having the guts to put it in.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s scary to play against, right?</p>
<p>The easiest opponent to play against</p>
<p>is one who&rsquo;s just straightforward,</p>
<p>passive, you know, not wild and crazy.</p>
<p>Playing against him,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s going to put you in the blender, as we say.</p>
<p>Yeah, how can you control</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re perceived as representing?</p>
<p>What hand you&rsquo;re perceived of as representing?</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re, if the game of modern poker is,</p>
<p>others are representing certain hands</p>
<p>through the information they convey,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re representing a certain hand range, sorry,</p>
<p>through your play, how can you control that?</p>
<p>Or is that not, is that the wrong way to think about it?</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t bluffing and bet sizing</p>
<p>and all of that kind of stuff essentially controlling</p>
<p>what others perceive as the hand range you have?</p>
<p>Ultimately, in terms of like controlling</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s perception of you, you can&rsquo;t fully control it,</p>
<p>but you can do things to sway it, right?</p>
<p>As I said earlier, showing bluffs and things like that,</p>
<p>you know, leads your opponent to think</p>
<p>maybe you do this more often than you&rsquo;re supposed to</p>
<p>or whatever the case may be.</p>
<p>But in terms of like controlling, you know,</p>
<p>what your opponent can think about your hands</p>
<p>in certain spots, I don&rsquo;t really think it equates that way.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really, you know, I think what people do</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re playing a hand is they think in terms of,</p>
<p>all right, what does my range look like here?</p>
<p>Okay, so my range has value.</p>
<p>So you look at, you know,</p>
<p>the actual hand you have secondarily.</p>
<p>So you say, okay, well, I could have this,</p>
<p>I could have this, I actually have this, right?</p>
<p>But I could have all these hands.</p>
<p>So my opponent, if he&rsquo;s thinking on a high level,</p>
<p>he knows I could have all these hands and I have this one.</p>
<p>So what do I do with this one, right, in the bigger scope</p>
<p>of things?</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;m trying to understand if your betting</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t a bet, preflop, your bet,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t that narrow the hand ranges?</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter what you have, it narrows the end.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And if you bet big combined with the perception of you</p>
<p>at the table, doesn&rsquo;t that represent the hand range?</p>
<p>Uh huh, absolutely.</p>
<p>So like you can, with betting essentially control</p>
<p>what people estimate you to have.</p>
<p>Sure, so that makes it, so yeah, so that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>So for example, one of the most extreme examples is,</p>
<p>we have, there&rsquo;s spots where there&rsquo;s a bet</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s considered polarizing, right?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s a thousand in the pot</p>
<p>and you bet 10,000, which is crazy big, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s saying one of two things.</p>
<p>I either have the absolute best possible hand</p>
<p>or absolutely nothing,</p>
<p>because any of the hands in the middle,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t do that with.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m essentially telling you when I bet that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I either got it or I got,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a mediocre hand,</p>
<p>like just a pair of nines or a pair of tens.</p>
<p>I have a royal flush or have nine high.</p>
<p>So with my bet sizing,</p>
<p>I can control how my opponent is perceiving</p>
<p>what my range is gonna be.</p>
<p>So for example, similarly, if I bet small, right?</p>
<p>Well, that could be a lot of hands, right?</p>
<p>That could represent a big part of my range.</p>
<p>The bigger the bet, the more, the narrower the range.</p>
<p>Apparently the more polarized it is.</p>
<p>Yeah, how far could you get</p>
<p>without looking at your cards?</p>
<p>Do you think how well could you do?</p>
<p>It depends on who I&rsquo;m playing with, right?</p>
<p>So if I was playing in a tournament</p>
<p>with mediocre or weak players,</p>
<p>I think I could probably do pretty well.</p>
<p>But even like world class.</p>
<p>World class, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d have much of a chance,</p>
<p>really, I mean.</p>
<p>The question is trying to get at like,</p>
<p>how important is it that the actual hands you have</p>
<p>versus the hands you&rsquo;re representing?</p>
<p>Right, so that&rsquo;s the question of essentially,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not looking at your hand preflop,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically giving up a fundamental advantage, right?</p>
<p>Where you&rsquo;re gonna be playing way suboptimally</p>
<p>in terms of your hand selection, right?</p>
<p>Cause if you don&rsquo;t look at your hand,</p>
<p>you might have a two and a three.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not good, but now you&rsquo;re playing it.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve invested whatever, two, 3000 bucks</p>
<p>with absolute garbage,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very difficult to climb that hill, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s much better to actually look at your cards</p>
<p>and go, okay, I&rsquo;ll throw away the two and three</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll play the ace king.</p>
<p>Speaking of garbage, you&rsquo;ve said that 10, seven</p>
<p>is your favorite poker hand to play.</p>
<p>Is that still the case and what aspect of it</p>
<p>is that you enjoy?</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s one of those viewer discretion is advised.</p>
<p>Like 10, seven, I&rsquo;ve just noticed throughout my life,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s a tendency thing that I&rsquo;ve been lucky with it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s just sort of,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m gonna look at 10, seven and go,</p>
<p>oh, wow, you know, I&rsquo;m gonna call it all in</p>
<p>or anything like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll play it in situations where it makes sense,</p>
<p>but you know, it&rsquo;s rare cause it&rsquo;s not a very good hand.</p>
<p>But is there some aspect of belief</p>
<p>in the magic of this hand manifests quality of play?</p>
<p>Or is that a little?</p>
<p>There should be.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the thing, it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>poker players, some have said</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unlucky to be superstitious,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re all a little bit superstitious, a little bit.</p>
<p>You know, and so I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>maybe it is a case where when I have 10, seven,</p>
<p>I feel somehow energetically that, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more likely to catch something,</p>
<p>which may actually make me more apt to be aggressive</p>
<p>and confident in the hand.</p>
<p>But you really shouldn&rsquo;t let yourself do that.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re not supposed to fall in love</p>
<p>with any specific hands.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you know, uncertainty is ruthless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, the fact that it&rsquo;s a game of statistics,</p>
<p>it can be too painful for the human psychology.</p>
<p>So maybe you have to hold on to certain superstitions.</p>
<p>Because, you know, I mean, there&rsquo;s a cold absurdity</p>
<p>to the fact that you can play extremely well and still lose.</p>
<p>I mean, actually this year you&rsquo;ve played the,</p>
<p>what is it, 50 days of World Series of Poker.</p>
<p>And it seems like, at least from the perspective</p>
<p>of me looking at it through the internet,</p>
<p>it seems like there&rsquo;s a lot of hands</p>
<p>that you were like 70, 30, 80, 20, all in hands</p>
<p>that you just did not, were not going your way.</p>
<p>That can sort of break you mentally.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah, one of the hardest things, especially about playing,</p>
<p>because cash games and tournaments are different.</p>
<p>One of the most difficult things about, you know,</p>
<p>being a tournament player is resilience.</p>
<p>Because more often than not, like,</p>
<p>so if there&rsquo;s a tournament with a thousand people,</p>
<p>to win the tournament, you have to get all of the chips.</p>
<p>That means there&rsquo;s one winner and 999 losers.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very rare that you actually like win all the chips.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re essentially at some point</p>
<p>in every tournament you play,</p>
<p>gonna deal with like really bad luck and disappointment.</p>
<p>And sometimes those streaks can have you question yourself</p>
<p>and be introspective about, okay,</p>
<p>so I think I&rsquo;m 47 now.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve gotten better as time went on</p>
<p>between distinguishing, okay,</p>
<p>am I losing right now because of bad luck?</p>
<p>Or is it fundamentally decisions I&rsquo;m making</p>
<p>are not very good, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the hardest things</p>
<p>for anyone who plays poker to get to, right?</p>
<p>Why am I losing?</p>
<p>Am I losing because of my opponents being better?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not playing well, or am I losing just because of luck?</p>
<p>And because there&rsquo;s so much variance in poker,</p>
<p>a lot of players can be confused</p>
<p>on both sides of the coin.</p>
<p>One guy&rsquo;s winning and he thinks he&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s really not, wait till the cards break even as we say.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of parallels to life as well.</p>
<p>If you get screwed over, over and over,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to know if you&rsquo;re doing something wrong</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s just bad luck.</p>
<p>I think they did a study.</p>
<p>I remember there was like a study</p>
<p>that was mostly related to gambling,</p>
<p>but it was mice and they put them in a little maze</p>
<p>and they go down these three tubes</p>
<p>and they go down this one tube and there&rsquo;d be cheese, right?</p>
<p>And then they go down again, cheese.</p>
<p>Three times in a row there was cheese there, right?</p>
<p>The next time there was an electric shock there, not cheese.</p>
<p>The rat went, you know, the mouse went to get zapped.</p>
<p>He got zapped, okay, came back.</p>
<p>He kept going back to get zapped until he died.</p>
<p>Like he kept going because he found cheese there.</p>
<p>He has one there.</p>
<p>So he continued to go chase that win</p>
<p>despite it being, you know, now all of a sudden</p>
<p>not worthwhile till he died.</p>
<p>And essentially what they said was</p>
<p>that is essentially how they compared it</p>
<p>to like, you know, the gambling brain</p>
<p>and how people think about gambling.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re chasing the wins.</p>
<p>You learn too much.</p>
<p>You sort of overgeneralize the lessons learned</p>
<p>from the times you&rsquo;ve won.</p>
<p>So yeah, like beginner&rsquo;s luck can be detrimental.</p>
<p>If you have some early luck and you believe</p>
<p>that this is just the way it&rsquo;s supposed to be forever,</p>
<p>you know, it can put you in a delusional state</p>
<p>where, you know, you feel like I&rsquo;m just great,</p>
<p>but no, you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>You were just lucky in the beginning.</p>
<p>I actually played poker once in Vegas.</p>
<p>It was a, it wasn&rsquo;t a tournament,</p>
<p>but it was a kind of tournament like style.</p>
<p>I already forgot what it was.</p>
<p>But what I do remember is that I had four of a kind.</p>
<p>So the last hand I&rsquo;ve ever played in poker was,</p>
<p>I got a four of a kind and there was a couple of others</p>
<p>with really strong hands.</p>
<p>So everybody went all in.</p>
<p>And I think you get some kind of bonus</p>
<p>for getting four of a kind.</p>
<p>Bad beat jackpot you were playing in.</p>
<p>Yeah, so something like this.</p>
<p>I apologize if I don&rsquo;t know the details,</p>
<p>but I just remember winning a lot of money</p>
<p>and I walked away from the table.</p>
<p>I said, I&rsquo;m not playing poker again.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna hit it up top.</p>
<p>Cause I started to feel like this is your,</p>
<p>I started to think,</p>
<p>even though I haven&rsquo;t really played poker at all,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m good.</p>
<p>And that was a really dangerous feeling.</p>
<p>And everybody was really mad for walking away</p>
<p>from the table.</p>
<p>One of the other things that I think is interesting</p>
<p>about poker too is good is relative, right?</p>
<p>So you could be the seventh best player in the whole world,</p>
<p>like literally seventh best player.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re playing with the other six,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the sucker.</p>
<p>You are like the worst player in the game, right?</p>
<p>So like there&rsquo;s a lot of players, for example,</p>
<p>like the Dan Blazarians of the world, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not a top level player,</p>
<p>like these guys you see on TV,</p>
<p>but he probably makes more money than they do</p>
<p>because he plays with people</p>
<p>that are far below his skill level.</p>
<p>So part of the skill of being a poker player</p>
<p>is finding situations where you&rsquo;re profitable,</p>
<p>regardless of your skill level.</p>
<p>Another connection to life.</p>
<p>Do you think Dan Blazarian is telling the truth</p>
<p>about having made, what is it, $50, $100 million?</p>
<p>Just a huge amount of money playing poker.</p>
<p>Considering what I know about the private games</p>
<p>and the types of players who play in these private games</p>
<p>and the stakes that they play,</p>
<p>I absolutely believe Dan has made,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many millions,</p>
<p>but whether it&rsquo;s 50 or whatever,</p>
<p>but it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me</p>
<p>that if you play in these games within a year</p>
<p>or you find the right businessman</p>
<p>who has way too much Bitcoin money,</p>
<p>and in one night you take him for 20 million,</p>
<p>I absolutely could see it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any reason why.</p>
<p>Listen, where he got his money initially,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s up to interpretation from his father or whatever,</p>
<p>but has he made a bunch of money playing poker?</p>
<p>Absolutely, no question.</p>
<p>Do you feel, as somebody who loves the game,</p>
<p>do you think there&rsquo;s something almost ethically wrong</p>
<p>in playing people much worse than you?</p>
<p>So yeah, that&rsquo;s a good question</p>
<p>because part of the reason I played poker</p>
<p>and wanted to become professional</p>
<p>was I wanted to make my mother proud, right?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think she would be proud of me</p>
<p>taking Grandma Betty&rsquo;s last $5 and down the street,</p>
<p>sending her broke and taking her pension check.</p>
<p>So I play at the high stakes</p>
<p>against people who can afford it.</p>
<p>They know who I am.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a hustler.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not pretending I&rsquo;m bad at poker to squeeze in.</p>
<p>I was thinking about this just yesterday</p>
<p>because I played in a game</p>
<p>that if I played that sort of role</p>
<p>where a lot of guys do pros</p>
<p>that sort of play down their skill level,</p>
<p>pretend they&rsquo;re just one of the guys,</p>
<p>these guys can make $20, $30 million in a year, legitimately.</p>
<p>Like I believe that like, if I did that,</p>
<p>if I just said, you know what, I&rsquo;m gonna go down that path,</p>
<p>get into these games in LA, you know,</p>
<p>and travel and do all this kind of stuff,</p>
<p>I can make 20 million a year.</p>
<p>But it feels a little greasy, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to kiss anyone&rsquo;s ass.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to ask anyone for a favor or things like that.</p>
<p>So, but yeah, like I feel, listen,</p>
<p>a rich guy who wants to sit down with a million bucks</p>
<p>and get drunk and lose it, I have no empathy for that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t have any moral qualms with that.</p>
<p>So if a grandma Betty is a billionaire.</p>
<p>Send it, send it, right?</p>
<p>You know, absolutely, why not?</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you about a tough period</p>
<p>of your recent life.</p>
<p>You had a rough, like we mentioned,</p>
<p>the World Series of Poker losing $1.1 million over 48 days.</p>
<p>What were you going through mentally during that?</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the thing, you know, I do, like you said,</p>
<p>I do a YouTube vlog every day.</p>
<p>So I kind of share my thoughts and listen,</p>
<p>I can edit that thing and keep out the bad stuff,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s more authentic and genuine to show people</p>
<p>the actual struggles and the pain that I go through,</p>
<p>you know, without it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d say the one thing I&rsquo;m most proud of</p>
<p>throughout the entire thing is the resilience</p>
<p>because there are moments you see me where I&rsquo;m broken.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like, I can&rsquo;t take it.</p>
<p>I broke a selfie stick this year.</p>
<p>Like I was filming it.</p>
<p>Cause you know, I do for my vlog,</p>
<p>I smashed the stick through it in the corner, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, that was my like hit rock bottom moment.</p>
<p>And then I put the camera on me and I was like, all right,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let people see it.</p>
<p>But mentally it was very difficult</p>
<p>because there was a feeling of hopelessness</p>
<p>where I was making good decisions.</p>
<p>Like I genuinely felt like I&rsquo;m playing really, really well.</p>
<p>But every time my money went in and my opponent&rsquo;s money</p>
<p>went in and say, I was 60%, 70%, 80%</p>
<p>for about a two week stretch, I lost every one of those.</p>
<p>And you start to wonder, you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t win if I never win, you know, in these spots.</p>
<p>So it was difficult.</p>
<p>Luckily I have, you know, 20 odd years of experience</p>
<p>on how to deal with it.</p>
<p>And so, as I said, I wake up the next day, ready to go.</p>
<p>So as if nothing happened.</p>
<p>To a certain degree.</p>
<p>Obviously, you know, the more,</p>
<p>the more it happens in the higher vines,</p>
<p>like the one where I broke the selfie stick,</p>
<p>I lost 500,000 in that tournament, right?</p>
<p>And it was like the last card, it was painful.</p>
<p>I think you lost.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was great, that video.</p>
<p>I think he lost.</p>
<p>What led up to the selfie stick gate?</p>
<p>Like what, you just lost your shit</p>
<p>for a, like a hundred milliseconds.</p>
<p>Like it was very brief.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just like, what, the world wasn&rsquo;t making any sense.</p>
<p>Like, how do I keep losing kind of thing?</p>
<p>How did you, why did you lose your shit?</p>
<p>You should never really think like this,</p>
<p>but part of me felt like I deserved to win this, right?</p>
<p>So part of me was like, listen,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lost so many in the last two weeks, all right.</p>
<p>Let, you know, the poker gods be kind to me right now.</p>
<p>Let me win this.</p>
<p>And it looked good.</p>
<p>I was in a great situation on the flop,</p>
<p>great situation on the turn.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to be a competitor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be a contender in this tournament</p>
<p>to win a big prize pool and turn the whole thing around.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all there for the taking.</p>
<p>And then boom, the last card, it just, you know,</p>
<p>it was a couple of weeks of frustration</p>
<p>in the moment of filming that I just had, you know,</p>
<p>sort of a visceral reaction, you know,</p>
<p>and I smacked the, smacked the selfie stick.</p>
<p>And then like, I, it was, I see a corner, it&rsquo;s safe.</p>
<p>I threw the selfie stick on the ground.</p>
<p>And of course, social media blows up about how, you know,</p>
<p>it was a violent act, you know?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like, have you never watched sports?</p>
<p>Have you never seen a guy on the golf course</p>
<p>smack his club or throw their helmet?</p>
<p>Like, you know, there was the,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a guy, Justin Bonomo is a poker player.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a super, how to, for lack of a better word,</p>
<p>offended by everything.</p>
<p>And he was equating my throwing a stick on the ground</p>
<p>to violence against women, domestic abuse,</p>
<p>and the idea that like,</p>
<p>this makes women feel unsafe to play poker.</p>
<p>And so that was kind of a running joke</p>
<p>for the last two weeks where every time I sat at a table,</p>
<p>the guys would be like, oh, I feel unsafe, I feel unsafe.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Can you take me through the hand?</p>
<p>Do you remember what the hand was?</p>
<p>Like, what was the&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, so it was a, you know, a player on the button raised.</p>
<p>David Peters, very aggressive player.</p>
<p>He went all in from the blind</p>
<p>and I had a pair of pocket tens.</p>
<p>So I went with my tens and he had queen 10 of spades.</p>
<p>So I was good.</p>
<p>I have way the best hand.</p>
<p>And the flop was like king nine, three, one spade.</p>
<p>Turn was like the eight of spades.</p>
<p>So now he has a flush draw and the river was another spade.</p>
<p>So he caught spade, spade, and he made a flush.</p>
<p>Wow, but statistically you were winning the whole time.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was winning it up until the last card.</p>
<p>What did he go all in on?</p>
<p>Was it a bluff?</p>
<p>He made what&rsquo;s considered like a pretty standard play</p>
<p>in modern poker where, you know, a guy raised</p>
<p>and he was just trying to pick up, you know, what was there.</p>
<p>And he ran into a hand in the big blind</p>
<p>and you know, he got lucky.</p>
<p>So what was the throughout the strategy of preparation,</p>
<p>the strategy of play?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re playing so many days.</p>
<p>Are you trying to ignore the results</p>
<p>and stick to a particular strategy?</p>
<p>Yes, for the most part, you know,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m trying to do is like,</p>
<p>I formulate a strategy for the whole seven weeks</p>
<p>cause there&rsquo;s a varying degree of buy ins too.</p>
<p>Like you have small ones, like 1500,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ve got like $250,000 buy in.</p>
<p>So I map out the seven weeks and right,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give a little bit of mental energy to the 1500,</p>
<p>which means I&rsquo;ll be on my phone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna, I don&rsquo;t care as much about this one,</p>
<p>but the 250K fully engaged, fully focused, you know,</p>
<p>up against obviously the higher the buy in,</p>
<p>you know, super top competition.</p>
<p>And you know, as far as strategy goes,</p>
<p>focusing on each day, playing the best I can,</p>
<p>not the result.</p>
<p>Like, cause if you focus on the result,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re focusing in the wrong place.</p>
<p>Your focus should be on the decisions you actually make.</p>
<p>Right, and if you&rsquo;re making good decisions consistently,</p>
<p>you have to continue to do that.</p>
<p>The frustrating part is this,</p>
<p>with poker, unlike chess or other things,</p>
<p>making the best possible decision doesn&rsquo;t mean you win.</p>
<p>Often you lose, you don&rsquo;t, chess.</p>
<p>Well, Magnus Carlsen has also talked about that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some non deterministic thing about chess too,</p>
<p>given the limited cognitive capacity of the human mind.</p>
<p>So he says that the world championship should have</p>
<p>20, 30, 40, 50 games, not the few that they have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too low of a sample.</p>
<p>So in that sense, the high stakes poker tournaments</p>
<p>are very too low sample.</p>
<p>Sure, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, when you think of the world series of poker,</p>
<p>so as you said, I lost about 1 million, right?</p>
<p>In one tournament, that was 500,000.</p>
<p>So then, you know, like a few others here</p>
<p>of high buying tournaments.</p>
<p>So the sample or the amount was, you know,</p>
<p>40, 50 total tournaments with, you know, high variance.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t run well or do well in the highest buy ins,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;re gonna have a losing summer.</p>
<p>So you did a podcast on the mental game a few years ago,</p>
<p>but then that&rsquo;s just something you really care about.</p>
<p>So what aspects of the mental game in poker</p>
<p>is most difficult to master?</p>
<p>I think the most difficult thing for people</p>
<p>is self awareness, right?</p>
<p>And resilience, self awareness to know, okay,</p>
<p>so, you know, again, is it, am I not doing as well</p>
<p>as I could be because of luck</p>
<p>or is there things that I can learn?</p>
<p>And I always look to mistakes as opportunities.</p>
<p>I really do.</p>
<p>When I make a mistake in a poker hand, right?</p>
<p>Call it a breakdown or whatever,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where breakthroughs happen.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, oh, you know what I could have done here?</p>
<p>I could have done this and that would have been really good</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna do that going forward.</p>
<p>So I think like with anything, you know,</p>
<p>when you start out playing golf,</p>
<p>like your goal is to just hit the ball, right?</p>
<p>Then you try to hit it in the air,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re trying to hit it straight,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re trying to hit it on the green,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re trying to hit it closer to the green</p>
<p>to the point where the pros get where, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so finite, they&rsquo;re trying to hit it 63 yards</p>
<p>and spin it back three yards.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s imperfect.</p>
<p>Like they don&rsquo;t hit the perfect shot</p>
<p>because the perfect shot for them is it goes in,</p>
<p>but they try and make the mistakes smaller</p>
<p>and smaller and smaller.</p>
<p>Poker is the same.</p>
<p>We all make mistakes consistently.</p>
<p>The goal is to minimize, especially the big ones.</p>
<p>What was the lowest point for you psychologically</p>
<p>in poker in general, actually?</p>
<p>Maybe it was this year, maybe it was in general.</p>
<p>Do you remember there was times in your life,</p>
<p>speaking of resilience,</p>
<p>that were extremely difficult to you mentally?</p>
<p>Yeah, so early on, you know, as basically as a teenager,</p>
<p>I was playing in Toronto and then in my early 20s,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m going to Vegas, right?</p>
<p>And I thought I was the best.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like 21 years old, I&rsquo;m like, check me out, right?</p>
<p>Show up with $3,000, 24 hours later, you know, money&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>And I remember the moment vividly.</p>
<p>It was at the Binion&rsquo;s Horse,</p>
<p>it was about three in the morning.</p>
<p>I was playing with seven other people.</p>
<p>You know, I lost my last chips.</p>
<p>I went to the bathroom, washed up, got out.</p>
<p>They all left.</p>
<p>And it was like a moment where I realized like, okay,</p>
<p>in Toronto, I was the big fish.</p>
<p>But here, they were playing because of me.</p>
<p>I was the sucker.</p>
<p>I remembered every one of their faces.</p>
<p>And then I remember not having enough money</p>
<p>to get back to budget suites where I was staying.</p>
<p>So I walked, you know, I walked.</p>
<p>And in that moment I was thinking about like,</p>
<p>is this something that I&rsquo;ll be able to do?</p>
<p>Am I good enough?</p>
<p>You know, what am I going to do now?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in Vegas, I don&rsquo;t know anybody and I have no money,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>So that was certainly like what felt like a low point,</p>
<p>walking back behind Paradise and Twain,</p>
<p>which is not a great part of town.</p>
<p>Where did you find the strength to answer yes</p>
<p>to that question that you can still do good?</p>
<p>I think this has been sort of a pattern in my life</p>
<p>where like in the evening after it happens,</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t have it.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t have that feeling of hope or,</p>
<p>you know, resilience, if you will.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m allowing myself to experience despair,</p>
<p>which is exactly where I&rsquo;m at.</p>
<p>But then a good night&rsquo;s sleep, wake up the next morning</p>
<p>and just within me, I have that inner confidence to say,</p>
<p>you know what?</p>
<p>Fuck it, get back on the hobby horse,</p>
<p>find a way, make it work, right?</p>
<p>But I do believe it&rsquo;s really therapeutic and worthwhile</p>
<p>to allow yourself to feel and vent.</p>
<p>So many people today, the Instagram culture world,</p>
<p>I call it, it&rsquo;s like they want to act like they&rsquo;re perfect.</p>
<p>Nothing bothers them, bullshit, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re pissed off, it&rsquo;s okay to show it.</p>
<p>Emotion&rsquo;s fine, we all have it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason you have to suppress it.</p>
<p>Obviously, you don&rsquo;t want to have guys throwing selfie sticks</p>
<p>around the room every time they lose a pot, right?</p>
<p>But, you know, a little bit of&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna make everybody feel unsafe.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>That happens.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying, there is a culture of saying,</p>
<p>you know, stay positive, all this kind of stuff,</p>
<p>but you know, when you feel despair, don&rsquo;t resist it,</p>
<p>ride it out.</p>
<p>Because it doesn&rsquo;t go away, right?</p>
<p>That feeling, you know, you think you put it away</p>
<p>in the pit of your stomach and you think, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gone, it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s still there.</p>
<p>Let yourself go, fuck!</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all right.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with being</p>
<p>a little bit emotional, because once you&rsquo;ve experienced it,</p>
<p>you let it out, now you can move past it.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I feel like, as long as your brain chemistry</p>
<p>can support it, you can usually learn a good lesson</p>
<p>from it, like you become stronger,</p>
<p>you become more resilient through it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>And a good night&rsquo;s sleep can really help.</p>
<p>Absolutely, yeah.</p>
<p>So through 2022, and in general, what is a perfect day</p>
<p>in the life of Daniel Negrano look like</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re, like on a day when you have to play</p>
<p>a big game, big tournament game and so on?</p>
<p>So like, what time do you wake up?</p>
<p>What do you eat for breakfast?</p>
<p>So my life is twofold.</p>
<p>Like one, when I&rsquo;m playing hardcore, and one when I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>And they look very different, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll give you a quick glimpse of like when I&rsquo;m not,</p>
<p>up at 10, you know, breakfast, in the gym at noon,</p>
<p>you know, post workout,</p>
<p>meal, coffee, walk, like, you know, I try to get,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I do for cardio, you know,</p>
<p>and just very like home bodied.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t leave the house.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very like boring and mundane, right?</p>
<p>Long distance walks.</p>
<p>So like, what do you do when you&rsquo;re walking?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re thinking about stuff?</p>
<p>Well, no, honestly, I just walk on the treadmill.</p>
<p>I try to get 15,000 steps a day.</p>
<p>And I just walk for basically like an hour</p>
<p>while I watch a show or I&rsquo;m on the computer</p>
<p>or something like that, you know, I&rsquo;m on the treadmill.</p>
<p>Why walk and not running?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I think walking, I mean,</p>
<p>I do a little bit of running, but hardly any.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t enjoy it.</p>
<p>Like, I just like walking.</p>
<p>And frankly, for fat loss,</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s usually what I&rsquo;m doing after big poker tournaments</p>
<p>is getting back in shape, that walking&rsquo;s ideal for it, right?</p>
<p>So essentially it&rsquo;s like the tale of two.</p>
<p>During the World Series of Poker,</p>
<p>all my sort of structured life thrown out the window.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no walking.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very little walking.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very little working out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very little anything.</p>
<p>I go into the World Series, you know,</p>
<p>like this year I went in around 157</p>
<p>and I expected to gain about 10 pounds</p>
<p>during the World Series.</p>
<p>Not good pounds, it wasn&rsquo;t muscle,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s about what I did, 165.</p>
<p>And then I spend the next month trying to, you know, lose it.</p>
<p>But during the World Series, when I&rsquo;m playing,</p>
<p>the most important thing without question</p>
<p>that I have to focus on,</p>
<p>and this is why I stopped focusing</p>
<p>on working on all this stuff is sleep.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m not rested, I&rsquo;m useless.</p>
<p>If I only get five, six hours</p>
<p>and I have to go back the next day and play 14 hours,</p>
<p>the chances of me being at my best, very, very slim.</p>
<p>So sleep is a priority.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the perfect amount of sleep for you on those days?</p>
<p>Eight, seven?</p>
<p>So eight hours is my go to every night.</p>
<p>During the World Series of Poker, it&rsquo;s just not possible</p>
<p>because of the way that it&rsquo;s structured.</p>
<p>Sometimes the tournaments end at 2.15 a.m.</p>
<p>I get home about three o clock.</p>
<p>Takes me 30 minutes, 40 minutes to get to sleep.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m in bed by four.</p>
<p>Well, the tournament&rsquo;s at, you know, two.</p>
<p>So I have to get up and whatever.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very difficult to get exactly eight</p>
<p>a lot of the time.</p>
<p>You know, and also get back there in time.</p>
<p>Is there any hacks to quiet the mind?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re going on a pretty intense rollercoaster</p>
<p>mentally when you&rsquo;re playing.</p>
<p>Is there any tricks to getting to sleep</p>
<p>given the rollercoaster?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been very lucky.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m blessed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because of diet or what,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve always been a very good sleeper.</p>
<p>You just shut off.</p>
<p>I get to sleep and I sleep like a baby, you know?</p>
<p>And I also nap really well.</p>
<p>Like during the World Series, sometimes what will happen</p>
<p>is let&rsquo;s say I get knocked out of one event at 4 p.m.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s another one that I can jump in.</p>
<p>Instead of jumping right into it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go into like a private room and take 45 minute nap.</p>
<p>And you know, and give me enough energy to continue</p>
<p>and sort of reset my mind.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it solves a lot of problems with the nap too.</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>Yeah, I feel like the nap is a magical trick in life.</p>
<p>What else, diet wise?</p>
<p>What do you, your mind is going, you know,</p>
<p>pretty intensely all day.</p>
<p>Yeah, so during like, like I said,</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m not playing, I&rsquo;m super regimented.</p>
<p>You know, I have, I literally measure everything.</p>
<p>You know, I count calories, I count macros,</p>
<p>I follow it to a T.</p>
<p>Pretty balanced diet or any?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a vegan.</p>
<p>Vegan, yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, you know, a vegan diet, like.</p>
<p>But balanced in terms of carbs and protein.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, no, I mean, I eat a healthy amount.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing probably 150 grams of protein,</p>
<p>like 60 grams of fat, 50, and then about.</p>
<p>And try to measure it all out.</p>
<p>I do, yeah, I basically, I created a meal plan.</p>
<p>So what I did for myself is,</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;m really anal and I made a spreadsheet</p>
<p>with like a day&rsquo;s food and I have six different ones.</p>
<p>So I just follow it.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t, it actually makes my life so much easier</p>
<p>when I don&rsquo;t have to think about what I&rsquo;m going to eat</p>
<p>for lunch or what I&rsquo;m going to eat for dinner.</p>
<p>I already know what I&rsquo;m going to eat.</p>
<p>I already wrote it down and it doesn&rsquo;t get boring</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m switching it up every day, you know,</p>
<p>every six days and occasionally I&rsquo;ll, you know,</p>
<p>splurge or do something different.</p>
<p>During the World Series of Poker,</p>
<p>I eat whatever the fuck I want to eat.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s at 2 a.m. I don&rsquo;t crave</p>
<p>like a broccoli carrot salad.</p>
<p>Like I want chocolate, candy and chips.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll just do it.</p>
<p>So you listen to the cravings.</p>
<p>Yeah, I realized like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s surprising because like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re so regimented outside of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really difficult.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve done it before</p>
<p>where I played the World Series of Poker</p>
<p>and I made it a point to work out every day.</p>
<p>But what that did was it sacrificed sleep.</p>
<p>So then I found like at 1 a.m. I would be more tired,</p>
<p>you know, because I&rsquo;ve expended more energy</p>
<p>than I would otherwise.</p>
<p>So I essentially like look at the World Series</p>
<p>is six, seven weeks where my body&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just gonna take a beating, not like UFC fighter,</p>
<p>but like a different kind of beating.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s okay because I have so much confidence</p>
<p>that within six weeks of just like eating right</p>
<p>and working out, I can get back to where I was.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just hilarious to me that you&rsquo;d be eating chocolate.</p>
<p>What eating chocolate in bed</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re trying to get to sleep is this.</p>
<p>Like literally a bag of like chips or chocolate,</p>
<p>like on my way home and before bed,</p>
<p>you know, just whatever.</p>
<p>This is what the professional athlete does</p>
<p>at the highest, most difficult event of his career.</p>
<p>Okay, so what else is there in terms of mental preparation</p>
<p>and focus and meditation, those kinds of things</p>
<p>leading up to the games?</p>
<p>Is there anything you like to,</p>
<p>like any rituals you like to follow?</p>
<p>So yeah, I have dabbled in the past</p>
<p>with like meditation and different things like that.</p>
<p>And I know that there&rsquo;s health benefits to it.</p>
<p>And I understand that a lot of people get a lot from it</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve done it for a good amount of time,</p>
<p>like long periods of time.</p>
<p>I found that for me, I think it was predominantly placebo.</p>
<p>Like it really wasn&rsquo;t doing anything for me</p>
<p>that I felt like it was, it felt like I was doing something,</p>
<p>but I really, I didn&rsquo;t see any specific results from it.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t really do that too much.</p>
<p>One thing that I will do for me is leading up</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s so much footage now</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll make it a point to like watch my opponents</p>
<p>and then with like my phone, I&rsquo;ll take notes</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll keep track of different things that I&rsquo;m seeing.</p>
<p>And that sort of, and then what I&rsquo;ll do</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;ll formulate a game plan.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m playing the Poker Masters coming up</p>
<p>in about a week.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll look to see the tendencies</p>
<p>of what my opponents are doing.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll come up with like some things</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m gonna do, some tricks of the trade, if you will.</p>
<p>Not game theory optimal stuff,</p>
<p>stuff that I think, oh, they&rsquo;re making a mistake here</p>
<p>that I can exploit.</p>
<p>And then I look to do that in different ways</p>
<p>and always look to throw curve balls.</p>
<p>How hard is that process?</p>
<p>Do you enjoy it or is it like really hard work</p>
<p>to analyze the players to try to understand</p>
<p>what are the different holes?</p>
<p>What are the different mistakes?</p>
<p>What are the strengths to avoid and that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>I think the only thing that makes it harder</p>
<p>is when you&rsquo;re young, right?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re in your twenties</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to make your nest egg.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, you&rsquo;re trying to make your retirement money.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re hungry, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like clubber Lang and you know the gym, you&rsquo;re hungry.</p>
<p>Whereas, you know, Rocky&rsquo;s in there taking pictures</p>
<p>and smiling and doing commercials and stuff like that.</p>
<p>So I am 47, I&rsquo;m financially okay.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to win.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to compete at the highest levels.</p>
<p>So I think it was a boxer.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember which one.</p>
<p>When asked this, he was asked the question,</p>
<p>how do you get up in the morning still</p>
<p>and do those morning runs?</p>
<p>And he says, you know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest with you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot more difficult doing the 4 a.m. run</p>
<p>in silk pajamas, right?</p>
<p>It just is, right?</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve always been self motivated</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve always found a way.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s harder in the sense of like, it&rsquo;s not a need.</p>
<p>I can still get by without it.</p>
<p>But so in that regard, it does feel like a little bit</p>
<p>of work where like, oh my God,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot of footage I gotta get through.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know that I have the time or I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that I wanna spend 10 hours of my day doing that</p>
<p>when I could be doing other things.</p>
<p>I mean, what do you still love about poker?</p>
<p>When you said, when you enter,</p>
<p>like the times you catch yourself just being able</p>
<p>to sort of take in the awe of it.</p>
<p>What aspects do you love?</p>
<p>I think that like for me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been really competitive,</p>
<p>but I was never gonna be a professional athlete</p>
<p>or a professional snooker player.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t good enough at any of that stuff.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have the body type, whatever.</p>
<p>But poker, it sort of levels the playing field, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re six, five, 240, big deal.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not fighting here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re fighting a different type of war.</p>
<p>So the competitive aspect,</p>
<p>I also have always been fueled throughout my career</p>
<p>by doubters.</p>
<p>So this is probably unhealthy,</p>
<p>but every time people say like, you&rsquo;re done,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re washed up, you can&rsquo;t win anymore,</p>
<p>it just makes me wanna prove them wrong, right?</p>
<p>So I have a little bit of that in me,</p>
<p>which again, you&rsquo;re reading the comments</p>
<p>and all these kinds of,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve been told many times throughout my career</p>
<p>for the last 15 that I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t compete anymore.</p>
<p>And I enjoy proving them wrong.</p>
<p>Yeah, the game has changed so much.</p>
<p>The greats of the past surely cannot be the greats</p>
<p>of the present.</p>
<p>That kind of commentary will continue for every sport.</p>
<p>And certainly for poker,</p>
<p>because poker really changed a lot</p>
<p>over the past couple of decades.</p>
<p>Can you speak to how much it has changed?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ve been at the top for so long.</p>
<p>Yeah, so complacency is a big issue</p>
<p>for people who make it, if you will, right?</p>
<p>So in my era of the poker boom, around the early 2000s,</p>
<p>there was a group of players who were the big names,</p>
<p>the stars of the game.</p>
<p>Well, a lot of them had their egos out of whack</p>
<p>where they just felt like, okay, I&rsquo;m the best, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Like, no, there&rsquo;s young guys learning,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s new software, there&rsquo;s solvers,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all these kinds of things.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re not keeping up, then you&rsquo;ll get surpassed.</p>
<p>And I remember myself at a very early age saying,</p>
<p>I never want to be that guy.</p>
<p>And it was one of my first events in the late 90s.</p>
<p>I was the young buck playing with the Tom McAvoy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and Brad Doughty, the guys of the era, right?</p>
<p>And I was doing things more aggressively</p>
<p>and they were scoffing at all these young kids</p>
<p>with their aggressive three and all this stuff.</p>
<p>And they were sort of mocking it, you know?</p>
<p>And I thought, never be that guy.</p>
<p>Always have the humility to be introspective</p>
<p>and always have the respect for your opponents</p>
<p>that while you think you&rsquo;ve got it all figured out,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re learning new things and you can learn from them.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve always been willing to sort of swallow my pride</p>
<p>and get coached by younger players</p>
<p>who I might even be better than,</p>
<p>but they see blind spots that I have that I might not.</p>
<p>And they, you know, they helped me improve my game.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been willing to sort of look every six months</p>
<p>or a year and say, is what I&rsquo;m doing working?</p>
<p>And if not, how do I get better?</p>
<p>But most people from my generation, they go the other way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, they just have this idea</p>
<p>that they figured it all out.</p>
<p>Once you feel like you&rsquo;ve mastered it,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing left to learn.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the moment where everyone else</p>
<p>starts to surpass you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the moment where you lose the mastery</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s always evolving.</p>
<p>How has the game changed?</p>
<p>So the game has changed</p>
<p>in terms of the way people learn it, right?</p>
<p>When I started out, the only way to learn how to play poker</p>
<p>was to sit your ass on the chair and play.</p>
<p>In person?</p>
<p>Yes, in person, play.</p>
<p>Maybe you jot down hands on a notepad.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t even have cell phones back then, right?</p>
<p>So I would write notes.</p>
<p>I actually brought a notepad.</p>
<p>And then you don&rsquo;t analyze it</p>
<p>and sort of try to figure it out that way</p>
<p>and think about maybe talking to friends</p>
<p>and different players.</p>
<p>Like when I grew up, there was John Jawanda,</p>
<p>Alan Cunningham and Phil Ivey.</p>
<p>And we would sort of create</p>
<p>like a little bit of a mastermind.</p>
<p>Well, how would you play this hand?</p>
<p>What would you do here?</p>
<p>That was the extent of it, right?</p>
<p>We never had the correct answers.</p>
<p>We always had theories about what might be right.</p>
<p>Not until about five, six years ago</p>
<p>where everything changed.</p>
<p>Where artificial intelligence created solvers</p>
<p>that will specifically say, okay, this is the optimal play.</p>
<p>This is the game theory optimal play.</p>
<p>So now it introduced poker to a whole new group</p>
<p>of like personality types.</p>
<p>In my day, it was people that were dregs of society</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t fit in, not college goers with a degree.</p>
<p>These are people who were street hustlers playing pool.</p>
<p>They found poker and they had these unique lives, right?</p>
<p>But now because poker can be studied,</p>
<p>much like you study university or college,</p>
<p>you had, for example, the German contingent</p>
<p>who was literally analyzing data</p>
<p>and coming up with strategies based on this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, what?</p>
<p>And the old guy, got to play by feel or whatever.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, they&rsquo;re learning.</p>
<p>So I guess the way that you describe it is like</p>
<p>in the old days, it required skill and talent,</p>
<p>a card sense, right?</p>
<p>That was the only way to become good.</p>
<p>And today that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>Good study habits, a good work ethic in that regard</p>
<p>can make you like a really good player.</p>
<p>Even if you aren&rsquo;t all that talented or gifted,</p>
<p>having a good work ethic is a talent, right?</p>
<p>Not necessarily card sense, but if you&rsquo;re able to put</p>
<p>in the work and study from these solvers,</p>
<p>you essentially have the perfect study tool now</p>
<p>that we didn&rsquo;t have in my day.</p>
<p>So what do the solvers give you?</p>
<p>Do you start to memorize the optimal play</p>
<p>for every single hand?</p>
<p>You try your best.</p>
<p>So again, solvers are imperfect as well,</p>
<p>in terms of the way the humans utilize them, right?</p>
<p>Because you can give solvers a certain number of inputs</p>
<p>in terms of what you want it to solve,</p>
<p>but a solver can think on many, many levels.</p>
<p>So for example, the way that a typical player</p>
<p>would do a solve is to say, okay,</p>
<p>what does a solver think is the best play here?</p>
<p>Bet one third pot, bet two thirds pot,</p>
<p>or bet one and a half times pot, okay?</p>
<p>You give it three parameters, it comes out with an output</p>
<p>and it tells you what you should do</p>
<p>with all the different hands you have.</p>
<p>However, that&rsquo;s a simplified version</p>
<p>of what a solver would really do,</p>
<p>because a solver might decide</p>
<p>that seven times the pot is best, 10% of the pot.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re putting in a solve,</p>
<p>you can only put in specific parameters.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why, frankly, that&rsquo;s typically the number,</p>
<p>one third, two third, and one and a half times pot</p>
<p>is what people often do.</p>
<p>So they sort of have a vague idea of what a solver wants.</p>
<p>But again, imperfect in terms of the implementation of it.</p>
<p>And memorizing all the variables,</p>
<p>like that King Jack offsuit with the King of Diamonds</p>
<p>is 13%, no human brain can do that.</p>
<p>So what you do is you bucket it.</p>
<p>Like you bucket it into say, instead of 10,000 variables,</p>
<p>you have 10 buckets and you say, okay,</p>
<p>with these hands, we do roughly this,</p>
<p>and we do roughly this.</p>
<p>And you try your best to stay within those lines.</p>
<p>But again, what I love about live poker partly</p>
<p>is that nobody will ever be able to master game theory,</p>
<p>and mimic a solver.</p>
<p>But you also have to incorporate your position,</p>
<p>where you are, and obviously what cards you have,</p>
<p>but also the size of your stack,</p>
<p>how much money you have,</p>
<p>and also whether you have the ability</p>
<p>or desire to buy in, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>So you have to calculate all of that, right?</p>
<p>So the solver will do that, right?</p>
<p>And essentially, you don&rsquo;t input your hand.</p>
<p>It tells you, you&rsquo;ll look at the grade,</p>
<p>and be like, all right, this is my hand,</p>
<p>and it tells you what it is.</p>
<p>But it tells you what you would do with any hand, right?</p>
<p>It gives you the full output.</p>
<p>And that actually gives you a better idea,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re ultimately, like you said,</p>
<p>playing a range of hands, not a hand.</p>
<p>And the solvers do things that are really interesting.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve seen AlphaGo, I would imagine.</p>
<p>Brilliant film, right, I thought.</p>
<p>And I thought what was interesting is there was,</p>
<p>you know, accepted theory from all the top Go players,</p>
<p>this is what you do.</p>
<p>But the AI was doing things way different,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, this has to be wrong,</p>
<p>but really it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So for example, a solver may say this, right?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you bet on the end, and you bet a lot,</p>
<p>and a solver may say, you should fold here</p>
<p>with a pair of kings and a queen kicker,</p>
<p>which is, you know, a pair of kings,</p>
<p>but call with a pair of fours and an ace kicker.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s essentially telling you</p>
<p>that you should fold this hand</p>
<p>that is much better than this.</p>
<p>So it begs the question, why?</p>
<p>Because what the solvers do is they use the information</p>
<p>of your own cards to formulate all the possible hands</p>
<p>your opponent can have.</p>
<p>So if your opponent is,</p>
<p>so basically if you had the king, queen,</p>
<p>you know, it may say, for lack of a better nerdy term,</p>
<p>it blocks potential bluffing hands</p>
<p>that your opponent can have.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say if your opponent would bluff with queen, jack,</p>
<p>but you have a queen.</p>
<p>So there are less combinations of queen, jack.</p>
<p>So it will find a better bluff catcher, if you will.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really not intuitive to poker players.</p>
<p>Poker players usually think like,</p>
<p>well, this, my hand is pretty good, so I got a call,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not how a solver would think.</p>
<p>Solver uses, you know, common matrix and, you know.</p>
<p>And sometimes it&rsquo;s tough to get the good why answers</p>
<p>you just did for why a solver thinks something is better,</p>
<p>or maybe in poker it&rsquo;s a little bit easier,</p>
<p>but in the case of go and chess, it&rsquo;s not always obvious why,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not gonna explain stuff to you.</p>
<p>I think one of the best ways to learn poker</p>
<p>is when you see a solver output</p>
<p>and it tells you one of these things, try to figure out why.</p>
<p>Why does this solver do this?</p>
<p>Why does it want you to call with this and fold this?</p>
<p>And try to think about it on a deeper level.</p>
<p>And you go, aha, probably because this card</p>
<p>that I have here, you know, changes the range</p>
<p>of my opponent&rsquo;s, you know, potential.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to get your opinion</p>
<p>on your relationship with solvers.</p>
<p>Because for example, Magnus doesn&rsquo;t use them.</p>
<p>His team uses them.</p>
<p>Cause he feels like he&rsquo;s going to rely on it too much.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t use it when you&rsquo;re playing.</p>
<p>What you really want is to build up</p>
<p>an extremely strong intuition without the help of a solver.</p>
<p>Is there some aspect of that that rings true to you?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I totally can relate to what Magnus is saying.</p>
<p>First and foremost, because when solvers</p>
<p>was first introduced, I didn&rsquo;t come from that world.</p>
<p>I was so intimidated because I didn&rsquo;t know how to use it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to do an input.</p>
<p>So I had two guys, one guy&rsquo;s a data scientist</p>
<p>and, you know, another guy&rsquo;s like a poker savant,</p>
<p>if you will, and they coached me and they did it.</p>
<p>So today, if I was in a tough spot, you know,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t know, what would a solver do?</p>
<p>I will send them the hand and they&rsquo;ll run the solve for me.</p>
<p>And then sort of give me the parameters of what to do.</p>
<p>When I was playing, you know,</p>
<p>regularly using solvers with them,</p>
<p>we were spending six to eight hours a day</p>
<p>going over all these solves.</p>
<p>So intuitively I started to think and learn</p>
<p>about what the solver would want,</p>
<p>but I sort of understand where Magnus is coming from</p>
<p>in that you don&rsquo;t want to become a slave to the sim,</p>
<p>as I say, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one kid I know, I joked with him,</p>
<p>his name is Landon Tice.</p>
<p>And, you know, he made a play that the sim, you know,</p>
<p>would say, this is a good play.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m like, it&rsquo;s a good play, you know,</p>
<p>in a simulated world against the robot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not in practice against the human, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to be doing that.</p>
<p>So if you become a slave to the sim</p>
<p>and always do what the sim says,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re handcuffed to a certain degree.</p>
<p>Is there some, at the highest level plays,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still a role for feel and intuition?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not doing that,</p>
<p>cause here&rsquo;s the thing, right?</p>
<p>No human being plays perfectly balanced</p>
<p>in game three optimal like a robot would.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not, right?</p>
<p>So there are opportunities there to take advantage</p>
<p>of the things that they do that are slightly too aggressive</p>
<p>or less aggressive.</p>
<p>You know, for example,</p>
<p>say most human beings don&rsquo;t bluff enough in a certain spot.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t have to call with the correct range of hands.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not bluffing at the optimal frequency.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t have to call at the optimal frequency.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be making this mistake, frankly, if you did.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between in person and online play,</p>
<p>given that context?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, online poker and live poker,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same game, right?</p>
<p>Same, it&rsquo;s poker,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s different in so many levels, right?</p>
<p>I think playing online,</p>
<p>you have to focus far more on fundamentals.</p>
<p>You know, on game theory,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have the added bonus of looking across the table</p>
<p>and getting any sense of whether your opponent</p>
<p>is strong or weak, they&rsquo;re bluffing, whatever, you know.</p>
<p>And also because online poker, those that play it,</p>
<p>you play far more hands.</p>
<p>Like some of these guys are playing 10, 20 tables</p>
<p>at the same time, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re just, you&rsquo;re hitting the long run really quickly</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re creating a database on your opponents, right?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say, you know, online, I can see your data.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, well, this guy, he&rsquo;s playing 40% of hands.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s betting the river 80% of the time.</p>
<p>So now I can use that data and, you know,</p>
<p>exploit you that way.</p>
<p>When you play live, you don&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>Do you enjoy playing online?</p>
<p>I enjoy, so with online poker, I enjoy the convenience of it</p>
<p>because, you know, you can be on your couch</p>
<p>in your underwear, not leave your house.</p>
<p>Do you also play multiple games at the same time</p>
<p>or do you try to play one game?</p>
<p>I typically like to play one or two,</p>
<p>but I can play up to four.</p>
<p>I find that past four, it&rsquo;s hard for me to keep up</p>
<p>and keep track of what&rsquo;s actually happening.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a different mindset required.</p>
<p>Like a lot of these young guys,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re accustomed to 20 tables at a time.</p>
<p>It feels like the purity of the game is gone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much more robotic, right?</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re playing 20 tables,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just making decisions based on like what, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not thinking about the depth of the situation</p>
<p>and what just happened 15 minutes ago.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even know what happened</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t pay attention to all that at once.</p>
<p>And some of the magic of poker is the low sample.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>For example, and sorry to be bringing up Magnus so much,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s so much parallel between the two of you</p>
<p>and the poker and the chess world.</p>
<p>He hates Olympics and world championships</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff because it&rsquo;s so low sample.</p>
<p>But to me, that&rsquo;s part of the magic of it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the World Series of Poker, the main event.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a magic to it.</p>
<p>I agree, yeah.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what that is exactly</p>
<p>because so much of the stake is so rare,</p>
<p>so much drama and heartbreak leading up to it</p>
<p>that all somehow, yeah, it accumulates</p>
<p>to that magical moment when somebody wins.</p>
<p>Especially that event,</p>
<p>the World Series of Poker main event historically,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s it, you know, that&rsquo;s the pinnacle.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where like mainstream watches,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where people are tuning in</p>
<p>and the gravity of the moment, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so much bigger than people,</p>
<p>like everyone gets the opportunity</p>
<p>to play armchair quarterback too, right?</p>
<p>Oh, he should do this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not under the lights.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not under the pressure.</p>
<p>You know, it might seem easy for you at home to be like,</p>
<p>well, yeah, but you can see the whole cards.</p>
<p>You know, they can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Certainly the idea of the small sample with tournaments,</p>
<p>I like the idea that you don&rsquo;t have to worry about,</p>
<p>oh, well, if I do this now, then in the future,</p>
<p>you know, I won&rsquo;t be balanced.</p>
<p>I have to be balanced here or anything like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like really boring and lame, right?</p>
<p>Again, that is kind of the way the younger generation</p>
<p>learns how to play the game, being balanced in every spot</p>
<p>and then randomizing, you know, like, oh,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m supposed to do this 50% of the time.</p>
<p>Okay, so if my left card is red, I&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s black, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not even making,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re no longer making actual decisions for yourself.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just randomizing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s way less fun for me</p>
<p>than tailoring it to the situation.</p>
<p>And the final table at the main event,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s none of that.</p>
<p>You have to, I mean, it&rsquo;s all or nothing.</p>
<p>Well, you shouldn&rsquo;t be, but there are like, again,</p>
<p>I think a lot of the young guys,</p>
<p>they are thinking in that regard,</p>
<p>like, oh, randomization.</p>
<p>Maybe at that table, the final table at the main event,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s a hand that stands out to you</p>
<p>that was especially gutsy and powerful or memorable</p>
<p>for that you&rsquo;ve seen in the history of poker?</p>
<p>Well, for me, the one that stands out</p>
<p>and probably because I was so young</p>
<p>and it was my first year, like one of my wife,</p>
<p>won a bracelet that year,</p>
<p>was I was friends with Scotty Wynn, the Prince of Poker.</p>
<p>And he was heads up against the guy named Kevin McBride.</p>
<p>And I was on the rail, you know, I&rsquo;m like, wow,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna, you know, he&rsquo;s heads up.</p>
<p>And he was so cool.</p>
<p>Like he had a mullet, but it&rsquo;s perfect, right?</p>
<p>He had the white shirt, the black thing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s drinking a Michelob, smoking a cigarette, whatever,</p>
<p>you know, all chill.</p>
<p>He bets it all on the river.</p>
<p>And the guy&rsquo;s thinking, and he psychologically owned him.</p>
<p>And he said, he goes with his beer, he goes,</p>
<p>you call gonna be all over baby.</p>
<p>Ha ha ha, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Okay, so this guy who was an amateur heard that</p>
<p>and was like, there&rsquo;s so much pressure</p>
<p>in this moment right now.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t handle this pressure.</p>
<p>But Scotty just told me, if I call here,</p>
<p>the pressure&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to be under it anymore.</p>
<p>So he sort of hypnotized them into making the call,</p>
<p>you know, and Scotty had it.</p>
<p>Scotty had, you know, the full house</p>
<p>and it was over for the guy.</p>
<p>You call gonna be all over baby.</p>
<p>It was, I just, I love that aspect,</p>
<p>sort of the table talk dynamic,</p>
<p>which isn&rsquo;t as prevalent today as it was back then,</p>
<p>but that one sticks out.</p>
<p>And it probably, because it was one of my first.</p>
<p>So the few words you say at the table can completely affect</p>
<p>a hand like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s almost, that&rsquo;s scary.</p>
<p>It was just so cool to me, you know,</p>
<p>like just how he was so calm.</p>
<p>And I think that too, added more pressure to the amateur.</p>
<p>And I think like, again, part of it is,</p>
<p>even back then it was 1998,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still a big rail of people and there&rsquo;s lights</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re, you know, they&rsquo;re filming</p>
<p>and all this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a lot of pressure for a guy</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s never been in this environment.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m telling you, it can all be over soon.</p>
<p>It will all be over soon.</p>
<p>Just call, it&rsquo;s finished.</p>
<p>Something about that accent too.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re a master at table talk as well.</p>
<p>Do you have, do you just kind of go with your gut,</p>
<p>you flow with it?</p>
<p>Or is there a deliberate strategy with this sometimes?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s usually some sort of strategy that I think about</p>
<p>in terms of what I want to say and whatnot.</p>
<p>But a lot of the time I just go, I go with it, you know,</p>
<p>the more you talk, the more information you get.</p>
<p>Yeah, but in some cases against really good players,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just giving away information, right?</p>
<p>Like if I&rsquo;m playing against Phil Ivey,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not engaging in anything.</p>
<p>Cause he can read through it.</p>
<p>He can sense based on what I&rsquo;m saying, you know,</p>
<p>the clues and where I&rsquo;m trying to take him.</p>
<p>And he reads through, he sees the tree through the forest</p>
<p>or whatever you want to call it,</p>
<p>the forest through the trees.</p>
<p>And you know, so then I would just be like</p>
<p>allowing myself to be exploitable.</p>
<p>Is some of it just for fun?</p>
<p>Because at the end of the day, if you&rsquo;re having fun,</p>
<p>you might be at the top of your game.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this a lot lately actually.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny you bring this up</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been thinking about when I&rsquo;m at my best.</p>
<p>And I think I&rsquo;m at my best when I am comfortable like that.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Where I&rsquo;m not so stiff and worried about, you know,</p>
<p>checking properly and worried about reading people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, no, I&rsquo;m me.</p>
<p>All right, I&rsquo;m going to play some poker.</p>
<p>What do you want?</p>
<p>Do you want to call me?</p>
<p>Call, go ahead, do what you want.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Cause then I realized, you know, ultimately it was like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m comfortable in that.</p>
<p>My opponents aren&rsquo;t as comfortable in that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re comfortable with this, you know, the robot thing.</p>
<p>But I thought more about that and how,</p>
<p>especially with some tournaments coming up,</p>
<p>I plan on really kind of sort of getting back to my roots</p>
<p>in that regard.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>From a spectator perspective, I love it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also interesting whenever you see a Daniel</p>
<p>on the ground of quiet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting, like it feels like a calm</p>
<p>before a storm of sorts.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s also part of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, like I&rsquo;ve gone, I&rsquo;ve ebbed and flowed.</p>
<p>And like I said, you know, I took on some coaches</p>
<p>and that was really learning game theory.</p>
<p>Cause I felt like it was important to always stick,</p>
<p>you know, keep up with what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And then I do feel like to some degree,</p>
<p>it sort of took away a little bit of my own</p>
<p>instinctual ideas in terms of what I should be doing.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So I think like the most dangerous version of myself</p>
<p>is a deep understanding of the game theory</p>
<p>with my wisdom of many years of,</p>
<p>and comfort of just sort of like being myself at the table.</p>
<p>And being relaxed.</p>
<p>Relaxed.</p>
<p>Letting your mind flow.</p>
<p>Let me ask you the greatest, the goat question,</p>
<p>greatest of all time.</p>
<p>Can you make the case for a few folks?</p>
<p>So first you tweeted referring to Phil Ivey as the goat,</p>
<p>saying the goat doing goat things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a recent tweet.</p>
<p>So can you make the case for Phil Ivey,</p>
<p>or maybe who is the greatest poker player of all time?</p>
<p>Would you put Phil?</p>
<p>For me, until someone knocks him off the podium,</p>
<p>the king of poker and the goat is Phil Ivey.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>So, and the reason I say that is,</p>
<p>I think of poker as more than just one game.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s different variants.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s Holdem, Omaha, Stud, Triple Draw,</p>
<p>all these different types of games.</p>
<p>And Phil in every arena has been dominant.</p>
<p>Whether it was tournament poker, dominated it.</p>
<p>Mixed game, high stakes poker in Bobby&rsquo;s room, dominated.</p>
<p>Online poker against all the wizards, dominated.</p>
<p>Made millions in every arena.</p>
<p>And, you know, he sort of took a few years away from poker</p>
<p>with his legal troubles and things like that,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s been playing in the high roller series again.</p>
<p>And, you know, he comes from,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s cut from a different cloth,</p>
<p>but he has a tenacity and a focus that&rsquo;s unparalleled,</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>When he&rsquo;s in the zone, I mean, for lack,</p>
<p>and this has nothing to do with race.</p>
<p>It really has to do with mannerism,</p>
<p>but he does remind me of like a combination</p>
<p>of Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods</p>
<p>in the way that he approaches it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very intense.</p>
<p>And he outworks everybody, you know?</p>
<p>And I think, frankly,</p>
<p>a lot of his mannerisms do come from them</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s young watching these guys on TV.</p>
<p>And a lot of his ways of being, you know,</p>
<p>his learned behavior, I think probably from people like that.</p>
<p>People at the top of their sport</p>
<p>and people that are Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t just at the top of their sport,</p>
<p>but they kind of dominate the sport</p>
<p>to some kind of aura that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a uniqueness to them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not built like us.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not, you know, they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Like I wish, I wish I could have the kind of focus</p>
<p>that Phil Ivey has, you know, and see everything</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s saying.</p>
<p>I just, that&rsquo;s not me, you know?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>And he does, he has that gene, whatever it is.</p>
<p>But they also look like they&rsquo;re not having that much fun.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re more focused on the perfection,</p>
<p>like a dogged pursuit of perfection.</p>
<p>And you know, that might even be true.</p>
<p>It might not be as fun.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Like I have fun at the table.</p>
<p>When you look outwardly, you look at someone,</p>
<p>like maybe he is having a blast.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s just the way that he likes, you know?</p>
<p>Like is Tiger Woods having fun when he&rsquo;s like on 17</p>
<p>about to win a major?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t look like it, theoretically.</p>
<p>Well, if you look at Michael Jordan,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about Tiger Woods,</p>
<p>but I think they&rsquo;re more focused</p>
<p>on every single mistake they make.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re more obsessed about not making a mistake</p>
<p>and hating every time they make a mistake.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably like 99% of their mental energy.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s part of what makes them great, right?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t look past the mistake and just let it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s whatever.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, they want to correct it.</p>
<p>And yeah, there&rsquo;s a tension, almost like a trade off.</p>
<p>I wonder if that&rsquo;s always the case</p>
<p>between sort of greatness and happiness.</p>
<p>I remember Huck Seed, who, you know,</p>
<p>when I was a kid growing up, he was like the poker idol.</p>
<p>He won the world championship in 1996.</p>
<p>And I was lucky enough to hang out with him a little bit.</p>
<p>And he would go through these streaks</p>
<p>where he had an A game and he had an F game.</p>
<p>His A game was unparalleled.</p>
<p>Nobody could beat him, right?</p>
<p>But his F game was so terrible that he was just a fish.</p>
<p>You know, he was playing terribly.</p>
<p>And I remember him saying,</p>
<p>and it was exactly what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d make like one little mistake, right?</p>
<p>And then he would go off.</p>
<p>And I was like, Huck, why do you do that?</p>
<p>Like, you know, your B game would be just fine.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, well, if I&rsquo;m gonna make a mistake,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the point?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the point, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying.</p>
<p>Like, if you can&rsquo;t play perfect,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no point in playing at all.</p>
<p>So he was extreme in that regard,</p>
<p>in the way that he viewed it.</p>
<p>And depending on the sport,</p>
<p>those folks, like in chess, certainly the case,</p>
<p>that kind of mindset can destroy you.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>No, I totally see that.</p>
<p>Because of a sequence of mistakes.</p>
<p>Like the kind of year you had</p>
<p>with the well scissor poker</p>
<p>can completely destroy a human being.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not able to see the bigger picture of it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You said that Phil Ivey is the hardest,</p>
<p>your toughest opponent,</p>
<p>the toughest person to play against.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>And how do you beat him?</p>
<p>Because Phil Ivey&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s seeing things that nobody else has seen really.</p>
<p>Like subtle things, where I&rsquo;m putting my hands,</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m looking, you know, my pulse,</p>
<p>like stuff that I don&rsquo;t even know I&rsquo;m giving off.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s so engaged and so focused</p>
<p>and has such a, just a, he&rsquo;s fearless, right?</p>
<p>A lot of people, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll play poker and be like,</p>
<p>you know what?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this guy has it.</p>
<p>But do they have the guts?</p>
<p>Do they have the cojones, if you will,</p>
<p>to actually do anything about it?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And stand up to this person?</p>
<p>He does.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>I forgot the hand that you tweeted</p>
<p>about the goat doing goat things.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t even that big of a goat hand.</p>
<p>But like, there&rsquo;s hands where like,</p>
<p>there was a famous one in Australia</p>
<p>where the flop was like jack, jack at nine</p>
<p>and Phil check raised the flop with six, seven, nothing.</p>
<p>Just absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>And the guy re raised him, right?</p>
<p>And Phil just knew.</p>
<p>He went all in with nothing.</p>
<p>If the guy calls, he&rsquo;s done, he&rsquo;s cooked.</p>
<p>But he was so tuned in that this guy&rsquo;s not strong,</p>
<p>that he just, you know, he did things like that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s tough to play against a guy like that.</p>
<p>So he gets great reads and is able to execute on them,</p>
<p>has the guts to execute on them.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got experience, he&rsquo;s got work ethic.</p>
<p>He also, I think one thing I&rsquo;m underselling too,</p>
<p>is his strategic mind, right?</p>
<p>Like I believe that, you know, like I said,</p>
<p>the new age player, they learn how to play</p>
<p>through a very systematic approach.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s look at the data.</p>
<p>Make up a game right now.</p>
<p>Three cards, we each get three cards.</p>
<p>Jacks are wild, sixes are, you know,</p>
<p>six of hearts is wild, right?</p>
<p>Just make up that game.</p>
<p>Phil will figure it out intuitively,</p>
<p>very, very quickly, right?</p>
<p>Without having the answers for him, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like the difference</p>
<p>between the players of my generation.</p>
<p>We had to figure this stuff out on our own.</p>
<p>Today, well, I wanna know the answer,</p>
<p>I go ask the computer and the computer tells me.</p>
<p>So I really believe like if you created a game from scratch</p>
<p>that Phil Ivey would be my horse that I wanna play in it.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s in some sense in tune with some deeper thing.</p>
<p>He has what we used to call card sense.</p>
<p>Card sense.</p>
<p>Can you try to make the case for some others</p>
<p>like Doyle Brunson, Phil Hellmuth, Daniel Negrano,</p>
<p>and maybe one of the modern guys</p>
<p>like Justin Bonomo or somebody like that?</p>
<p>Sure, oh, so let&rsquo;s start with Doyle, okay?</p>
<p>Like what Doyle has going for him above all,</p>
<p>above and beyond is twofold, really.</p>
<p>Longevity, I mean, he&rsquo;s in his late 80s.</p>
<p>And last time I played with him, I was like,</p>
<p>how is he getting better?</p>
<p>Like I really felt like he was playing better</p>
<p>than he had, you know, in the previous years.</p>
<p>But also with Doyle, like Doyle had to figure,</p>
<p>you know, we talked about my generation</p>
<p>having to figure it on their own.</p>
<p>I mean, they really had to figure it out on their own.</p>
<p>Like they didn&rsquo;t have any computer simulation</p>
<p>to tell you if Ace King was a favorite over pocket sixes.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So we know what he did.</p>
<p>He would take a deck of cards and they would deal out,</p>
<p>and they were with a notepad, right?</p>
<p>Okay, Ace King won.</p>
<p>And then they would do like a hundred of them</p>
<p>and be like, all right, Ace King won like 53.</p>
<p>So it must be a favorite.</p>
<p>And he did it manually, you know?</p>
<p>And he did it in a time when it was very, very difficult.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s seen poker evolve and change throughout the years.</p>
<p>Now, listen, is he gonna be able to compete</p>
<p>against the top players in the world today?</p>
<p>Absolutely not, you know?</p>
<p>But how many people, he&rsquo;s the best 88 year old player</p>
<p>in the world by a mile, okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not even close.</p>
<p>And Doyle, again, he&rsquo;s another guy who plays all the games.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s played high stakes cash, tournaments, you name it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s iconic, you know, he&rsquo;s the godfather.</p>
<p>So, but there&rsquo;s also an element to that.</p>
<p>So the iconic element, like your personality in poker.</p>
<p>I mean, not to romanticize this thing too much,</p>
<p>but poker is also a game of personalities.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s part of the greatness</p>
<p>is like the uniqueness of the human being.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think also, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;d like looking at it from that perspective</p>
<p>in terms of like Goat,</p>
<p>like Goat in terms of what you represent,</p>
<p>like the cowboy, the godfather, you know,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s been around, you know,</p>
<p>we played in the sixties and stuff like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just something like incredibly cool.</p>
<p>Like I often think about if I could go back in time</p>
<p>and like visit, you know, an era,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to go like to Vegas in the seventies</p>
<p>and just like, I&rsquo;m proud.</p>
<p>I already, like, I can think of what it would smell like,</p>
<p>probably not ideal, cigarettes and, you know,</p>
<p>the leather jackets and just the vibe</p>
<p>of what it must&rsquo;ve been like with the mobsters</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s lived through all that,</p>
<p>all the cool movies we&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>Like Doyle talks about some of those films.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, yeah, that guy,</p>
<p>he said he was gonna stab me in my stomach.</p>
<p>You know, he knows these people.</p>
<p>It was, he&rsquo;s like a source of history, really.</p>
<p>Yeah, when poker was a game for the mob</p>
<p>and the degenerates and all that kind of stuff</p>
<p>before it transitioned into professional sport.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Professional game.</p>
<p>Yeah, so he was there through the whole thing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been there through the whole transition.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s seen it all, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then to the online world.</p>
<p>So what about,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even say without smiling, Phil Hellmuth.</p>
<p>Okay, so Phil, here&rsquo;s the thing with Phil.</p>
<p>He takes it very personal when I say this</p>
<p>and he doesn&rsquo;t hear the compliment.</p>
<p>He only hears the negativity.</p>
<p>Because Phil wants to be considered</p>
<p>the greatest of all time.</p>
<p>Hashtag positive.</p>
<p>He wants to be the greatest of all time.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m like, Phil, here&rsquo;s the facts.</p>
<p>You have the best, absolute greatest resume</p>
<p>at the World Series of Poker of anyone in the world.</p>
<p>Is that not enough, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you have.</p>
<p>You have that, right?</p>
<p>Now, do I think you&rsquo;re the best</p>
<p>no limit holding player in the world today?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Do I think that, you know,</p>
<p>you can play high stakes mixed games</p>
<p>with the best players in the world today and win?</p>
<p>No, right?</p>
<p>So he wouldn&rsquo;t get as much flack on this topic</p>
<p>if he wasn&rsquo;t so boastful and like, you know, demanding.</p>
<p>Like you never hear Phil Ivey say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the best in the world.</p>
<p>Like his peers do, right?</p>
<p>But Phil wants to make the claim.</p>
<p>And I simply say, I beg to differ, right?</p>
<p>I beg to differ.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t think you are the best player in the world.</p>
<p>If we can linger on the compliment so he can hear it,</p>
<p>what makes him so good?</p>
<p>Because it seems like a lot of times</p>
<p>his play is not optimal.</p>
<p>Yeah, he definitely has his own brand and style of play,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>He does not adhere to,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s never used a solver in his life.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t know, he&rsquo;s not in that world, right?</p>
<p>Phil has a lot of faith and a lot of confidence</p>
<p>in what he does and that it will be successful.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s something to be said about that, right?</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t ever lack in belief that he can win</p>
<p>and he finds a way to do it his way.</p>
<p>And frankly, a lot of what he does</p>
<p>is very effective against specific types of players</p>
<p>who are intimidated by him,</p>
<p>but whether it&rsquo;s his resume or his demeanor</p>
<p>or his attitude sometimes, right?</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re an average player</p>
<p>and then you beat Phil in a hand, you&rsquo;re gonna hear it.</p>
<p>This idiot from Northern Europe and beat me in this pot.</p>
<p>And for some people, they don&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>So he can use that against them.</p>
<p>But I also think too, like he cares so much, right?</p>
<p>And that leads to trying really, really hard.</p>
<p>Like he sees these moments and he doesn&rsquo;t phone them in.</p>
<p>Like whatever brand of poker he plays,</p>
<p>he tries his best at all times to succeed and to win.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some, even though like he&rsquo;s fundamentally flawed</p>
<p>in a lot of things that he does</p>
<p>compared to some of the bigger players,</p>
<p>his effort and will and like his determination</p>
<p>to stick around is, you know, is up there.</p>
<p>And he is somebody who seems to really hate losing.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah, he feels like he deserves to win, right?</p>
<p>In all cases.</p>
<p>And if he loses, it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s not just.</p>
<p>As you joked around that you and him</p>
<p>might do an anger management course.</p>
<p>Yeah, I did say that in one video.</p>
<p>Now this is tough because you&rsquo;re a humble guy,</p>
<p>but objectively speaking,</p>
<p>can you say what your strengths are?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re often listed as one of,</p>
<p>if not the greatest player of all time.</p>
<p>So what are the things that make you stand out?</p>
<p>So for me, when I grew up,</p>
<p>I admired the big cash game players,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what I was.</p>
<p>I love tournaments, but I wanted to be well rounded.</p>
<p>Like in my day, you couldn&rsquo;t make the poker hall of fame</p>
<p>if you just played one game.</p>
<p>You had to jump in to the high stakes games</p>
<p>in Bobby&rsquo;s room, as they say, right?</p>
<p>And I was able to do that.</p>
<p>When I was in my early, in my mid twenties,</p>
<p>I was playing 4,000, 8,000 limits.</p>
<p>You know, you could win or lose a million dollars in a day.</p>
<p>So I grinded it out.</p>
<p>Like a lot of people think, oh, you know, he&rsquo;s lucky.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s had sponsorship.</p>
<p>Otherwise he&rsquo;d be broke.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I built multi million dollar bankrolls</p>
<p>before any of that stuff existed.</p>
<p>And I did it the good old fashioned way</p>
<p>by sitting my butt on the table.</p>
<p>I think probably one of my biggest strengths</p>
<p>is self awareness.</p>
<p>And in that regard, a level of humility</p>
<p>that always allows me to say, okay, well, you know what?</p>
<p>In this case with these players, they&rsquo;re better than me.</p>
<p>So what am I going to learn from them, right?</p>
<p>Rather than have this need to say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the best because of history.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always looking to guys and go, wow,</p>
<p>he does this really well.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s the Adamos or the Ivies or whoever it may be.</p>
<p>So my willingness to adapt, I think,</p>
<p>and stay relevant by learning what the young guys are learning</p>
<p>is something I&rsquo;ve always done.</p>
<p>And I also pride myself on, again, being well rounded,</p>
<p>like playing all the games.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t feel intimidated in any game,</p>
<p>you know, whatever the format is.</p>
<p>So always being a scholar of the game</p>
<p>as the game evolves, as the different games evolve,</p>
<p>the different players evolve, the culture evolves,</p>
<p>always adjusting by being a scholar,</p>
<p>having the humility to be a scholar.</p>
<p>A healthy respect for, a healthy respect</p>
<p>for the younger generation, how they learn,</p>
<p>what they learn and what they can teach me,</p>
<p>rather than poo poo it and say, oh, these kids today.</p>
<p>Cause that&rsquo;s what a lot of people,</p>
<p>like the Mike Matisos and the Phil Hellmuth, my generation,</p>
<p>they just poo poo it because they don&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>On a level of one to 10,</p>
<p>their level of understanding of this is like a one, maybe.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m being generous by calling it a one,</p>
<p>they really don&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>So they poo poo it, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to do that.</p>
<p>Like, oh, that&rsquo;s not how I do it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s wrong or that&rsquo;s stupid or whatever.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t take that approach.</p>
<p>I go, well, let me learn.</p>
<p>Let me see what there is to this.</p>
<p>But that said, the crankiness that Matisos</p>
<p>and Phil Hellmuth have is great to watch,</p>
<p>especially when they&rsquo;re on a table with you.</p>
<p>Oh, I love it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a blast.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re masterful at being able to get under their skin.</p>
<p>What about somebody from the new school,</p>
<p>like Justin Bonomo, who&rsquo;s leading in terms of cash wins.</p>
<p>Is there somebody like that,</p>
<p>that stands out to you as a potential GOAT status person?</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&rsquo;s two different ones, but one is very&hellip;</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re both just no limit, right?</p>
<p>So again, when I think of poker,</p>
<p>I think of a variety of games,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s so many of the young guys that specialize.</p>
<p>Michael Adamo is one that I&rsquo;ve mentioned several times</p>
<p>and I love the way that he approaches the game.</p>
<p>Another one that&rsquo;s highly respected</p>
<p>because of his online prowess and his&hellip;</p>
<p>People have looked and how close he is to game theory</p>
<p>and they say he&rsquo;s about as perfect as you get.</p>
<p>And I got a kid named Linus.</p>
<p>Linus love online, Linus Linger.</p>
<p>So he just came second recently, I believe in the Triton,</p>
<p>huge Triton event.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s primarily an online player.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s an online cash player for the most part,</p>
<p>but he plays some live.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s, again, and I respect the peers that I play with</p>
<p>who say, yeah, he&rsquo;s tough as nails.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another kid too, Russian kid named Timofey Kuznetsov</p>
<p>and he plays all the games and he&rsquo;s well respected</p>
<p>in that regard.</p>
<p>And same with a guy like a Jungleman, Dan Cates,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a unique personality.</p>
<p>I mean, this guy showed up, won the poker players championship</p>
<p>back to back years in a Randy Macho Man Savage costume.</p>
<p>And he was doing Macho Man the entire time.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I&rsquo;m gonna take all the chips like I did last year.</p>
<p>Bust them all.</p>
<p>And he was in character for the entirety of the tournament.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>Just unique.</p>
<p>But yeah, I respect for a lot of those guys.</p>
<p>Is it gonna take time to figure out</p>
<p>who stands the test of time?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing, right?</p>
<p>So a lot of these kids,</p>
<p>like there was a guy who beat me heads up</p>
<p>in the million dollar one drop.</p>
<p>I got 8.7, he won $15 million, kid named Dan Coleman.</p>
<p>He was seen as like the next big thing in poker, right?</p>
<p>He made his money, just wasn&rsquo;t for him.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s moved on to doing what he&rsquo;s doing,</p>
<p>skiing in the Alps, whatever.</p>
<p>We have nobody seen him from like five, six years.</p>
<p>So that can happen, right?</p>
<p>Because there is a lot of burnout.</p>
<p>I think it was actually a Gotham Chess</p>
<p>who mentioned something about how difficult it is to like,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s true in poker.</p>
<p>When you get really, really good at something,</p>
<p>to get this much better takes so much work.</p>
<p>And a lot of people don&rsquo;t necessarily wanna put in</p>
<p>that kind of work in order to do that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just even staying at the same level</p>
<p>takes a huge amount of work.</p>
<p>Like, so if you wanna get better at chess,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re already like really, really good.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re trying to get like one little bit better.</p>
<p>You have to study like in a ridiculous amount, you know?</p>
<p>And again, that&rsquo;s once you&rsquo;ve already had,</p>
<p>I think the toughest thing for anybody,</p>
<p>once you&rsquo;ve tasted success</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve already achieved it,</p>
<p>staying hungry, staying on the top,</p>
<p>reaching the top is much easier than it is to stay there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Over years, what&rsquo;s your training regimen in poker</p>
<p>in terms of how you keep improving?</p>
<p>So you said you study games,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s mostly leading up to a particular tournament.</p>
<p>But is there kind of a behind the scenes daily activity</p>
<p>you try to do that kind of over time keeps you sharp?</p>
<p>So for me, now that I&rsquo;m 47,</p>
<p>and I feel like the predominant aspect of my poker game</p>
<p>is going to be in terms of my success</p>
<p>is gonna be my mental state, right?</p>
<p>So I find it&rsquo;s really, really important for me now</p>
<p>at this age to have balance.</p>
<p>So when I&rsquo;m not playing poker and I&rsquo;m out of it,</p>
<p>poker is not even on my radar.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re able to remove it from your mind.</p>
<p>Doing my fantasy hockey, play a little chess,</p>
<p>you know, play some golf, watch some hockey,</p>
<p>whatever the case may be,</p>
<p>outside of the game.</p>
<p>And then I start to get the itch.</p>
<p>Like after the World Series of Poker,</p>
<p>the poker door was closed.</p>
<p>Yeah, you took some time off.</p>
<p>All of August, I didn&rsquo;t play any poker at all</p>
<p>until just recently, you know.</p>
<p>I started to get the itch again.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s important for me,</p>
<p>is if I don&rsquo;t have the itch and I don&rsquo;t want to play poker,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m not gonna be at my best.</p>
<p>Once I start getting the itch,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when I start to say,</p>
<p>okay, let&rsquo;s start watching some of these streams.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see what my opponents are up to lately.</p>
<p>And, you know, let&rsquo;s look at some solvers</p>
<p>and different things like that.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re doing pretty good.</p>
<p>You came back and doing pretty good.</p>
<p>Yeah, so far.</p>
<p>Do you like being in front of the camera</p>
<p>through the hell of the World Series of Poker this year?</p>
<p>You filmed every single day.</p>
<p>You did a vlog.</p>
<p>Does that energize you?</p>
<p>Is that exhausting?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s really beneficial to a huge amount of people.</p>
<p>It energizes the poker community.</p>
<p>But do you see it as a service</p>
<p>or do you purely just love it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been comfortable on camera since I was a kid.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, I wanted to be an actor.</p>
<p>Like really, really young.</p>
<p>And I was always comfortable in that environment.</p>
<p>I think like that gives me a little bit of an advantage</p>
<p>sometimes too, with these film events.</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;m comfortable with the mic on</p>
<p>and on camera with the lights.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of people maybe aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>with the knowledge that other people</p>
<p>are gonna see what they&rsquo;re doing every day.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s been so comfortable and easy for me.</p>
<p>As far as the World Series goes</p>
<p>and the vlogs and all the shooting,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of therapeutic for me.</p>
<p>It is essentially my version of journaling, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of value, I think,</p>
<p>in like at the end of a day doing a brain dump</p>
<p>where you just write out and journal.</p>
<p>But doing it on camera has this similar effect.</p>
<p>And it also, when you make a mistake on your own,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re held accountable to you.</p>
<p>But when I have to explain it to others,</p>
<p>like here&rsquo;s what I did.</p>
<p>And this is the mistake I made</p>
<p>or whatever the case may be.</p>
<p>It actually, I think that helps me.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you&rsquo;re held responsible by a larger audience.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like, so like I said,</p>
<p>listen, I&rsquo;m 47, my life is good.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to be in this tournament.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m over it, I can just dump my chips off and go home.</p>
<p>But I can&rsquo;t when I&rsquo;m doing the vlog,</p>
<p>like I have to actually answer to that.</p>
<p>And it keeps me in line.</p>
<p>How hard is it to win the main event</p>
<p>of the World Series of Poker?</p>
<p>So the main event of the World Series of Poker</p>
<p>is the hardest event to win</p>
<p>simply because of the sheer size of it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking seven, 8,000 players, right?</p>
<p>And a lot of landmines.</p>
<p>And frankly, there are so many players</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve not played with before too.</p>
<p>You play these high roller events, like the super ones,</p>
<p>you get 30, 40 people, you know everybody, right?</p>
<p>So you have an idea.</p>
<p>You sit at the main event, you don&rsquo;t have any idea.</p>
<p>This guy wearing a Philadelphia Eagles jersey</p>
<p>and sunglasses, and he just raised you big.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know this guy, I don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of like, it&rsquo;s grueling too.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re seven, eight days where you&rsquo;re in the blender</p>
<p>as you might say, so.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the structure?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s $10,000 buy in or something like that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a bunch of tables and you just keep playing.</p>
<p>Like when is it over for a single table?</p>
<p>Does it go?</p>
<p>So the way that it works is this.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s say 8,000 players.</p>
<p>And the way the main event works, unique to others,</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s various day ones you can play, right?</p>
<p>So a day one, you&rsquo;re gonna play from noon</p>
<p>till like midnight, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re still in, you bag up your chips</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll come back for day two, okay?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s four different day ones, right?</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;ll all combine essentially to play on a day two.</p>
<p>And at the end of the night, they redraw the tables.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t just win your table.</p>
<p>If players get knocked out, tables break,</p>
<p>they continue to be replaced.</p>
<p>So you start with 8,000, then after day one,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got 6,000, then you do the same.</p>
<p>You play like a 12 hour day and you slowly whittle down.</p>
<p>Day four, day three, day four, you&rsquo;re in the money.</p>
<p>And then you continue to progress.</p>
<p>And then what they do now with the final table is they,</p>
<p>because they were trying to do this for TV,</p>
<p>these final tables can take, you know, 12 hours to play.</p>
<p>And what we were finding was, you know,</p>
<p>you start the thing at 5 p.m. and it goes till 8 a.m.</p>
<p>And like nobody&rsquo;s watching anymore.</p>
<p>So they separate into three days now.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re talking now, it&rsquo;s like six, seven days</p>
<p>to get to the final table and another three days to play it.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re grinding for, you know, a week and a half.</p>
<p>But most of the time you&rsquo;re playing against people</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve never played against before.</p>
<p>Especially early on, yeah.</p>
<p>And then by the end, like, who knows?</p>
<p>You know, rarely do you see, you see in the last hundred,</p>
<p>you usually see some notable names.</p>
<p>Then in the last 27, you might see one, maybe two.</p>
<p>Final table, maybe one.</p>
<p>But often it&rsquo;s gonna be, you know,</p>
<p>some players you&rsquo;ve never heard of before.</p>
<p>Is there strategies that maximize your likelihood</p>
<p>of having a chance?</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>Like I think the World Series of Poker main event</p>
<p>is a unique animal in that, you know,</p>
<p>like we talk about game theory and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re focused on that when you&rsquo;re playing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really not playing well, right?</p>
<p>You need to just exploit</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re gonna have a lot of people</p>
<p>who see this as a bucket list item.</p>
<p>You know, they just wanna play</p>
<p>the main event in the World Series.</p>
<p>And they might be scared, they might be nervous or whatever.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to worry about being balanced, right?</p>
<p>Oh, you know, I have to make sure that I&rsquo;m, no you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You might not, you&rsquo;re playing with this guy now</p>
<p>for three hours, you might never see him again.</p>
<p>So just make the play that makes sense for you, right?</p>
<p>So yeah, you&rsquo;re gonna, I approach that event</p>
<p>very differently than I would</p>
<p>like playing against the high roller players</p>
<p>that I play with today.</p>
<p>Does that mean more aggressive essentially?</p>
<p>Less actually.</p>
<p>So when you play against really good players,</p>
<p>you have to take small plus EV scenarios</p>
<p>where you push the envelope</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re playing really aggressive.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re bluffing off your stack.</p>
<p>You gotta do this.</p>
<p>You gotta focus a little bit more on being balanced</p>
<p>because otherwise, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna beat these guys.</p>
<p>Whereas if you&rsquo;re playing with amateurs</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re playing with regular players,</p>
<p>for the most part, risking all your chips on a bluff,</p>
<p>probably don&rsquo;t need to do that.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to do that nearly as much.</p>
<p>You can probably slowly but surely build your stack</p>
<p>without taking, you know, those high risk,</p>
<p>high variance situations</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ll find better situations.</p>
<p>What mistakes do amateurs usually make</p>
<p>in tournaments like that?</p>
<p>Are they over bluffing?</p>
<p>Well, I think amateurs generally,</p>
<p>the biggest mistake they make is they think</p>
<p>that pros are bluffing more than they are.</p>
<p>So like a pro will bet all his chips on the end</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, ah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe, you know, it&rsquo;s Phil Ivey.</p>
<p>Maybe he&rsquo;s doing some crazy stuff.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, probably not.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s probably just got it, you know?</p>
<p>And then they lose all their money by calling</p>
<p>or going all in as well.</p>
<p>And so the right thing is to be more patient.</p>
<p>So amateur is too impatient or just bad reads?</p>
<p>So all the amateurs are built different.</p>
<p>Some of the amateurs are just too weak and passive.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just waiting for the nuts, you know?</p>
<p>And then, you know, the pros, everyone notices that.</p>
<p>And then when they make their big hand,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t get paid anyway.</p>
<p>So in order to win the main event,</p>
<p>I mean, you have to have some components</p>
<p>of your game that are aggressive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very unlikely to expect to just get the cards</p>
<p>the whole way and just always have the best hand.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have to find ways to win pots</p>
<p>that, you know, where you don&rsquo;t have the best hand.</p>
<p>How do you win the final table?</p>
<p>The final table is unique now,</p>
<p>especially because you&rsquo;re talking about the way</p>
<p>that poker works in tournaments is that</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s seven people left</p>
<p>and you have just, you know, you&rsquo;re very short on chips.</p>
<p>But if one other player goes out,</p>
<p>you just make like $300,000 for folding,</p>
<p>like just for sitting out, right?</p>
<p>The term for that that, you know,</p>
<p>show kids uses ICM, independent, you know, chip model,</p>
<p>right, where it talks about the value of each chip.</p>
<p>Where what happens, what we see now is,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say one guy has a big chip lead</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s another guy who&rsquo;s second in chips</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a couple that are short.</p>
<p>These guys in the middle, they just play super tight</p>
<p>and they wait for the little guys to go</p>
<p>while the big stack is just pounding them</p>
<p>because he can afford to, right?</p>
<p>He knows that people are handcuffed.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say I had 10 million in chips</p>
<p>and you have 9 million in chips.</p>
<p>And these guys have little chips.</p>
<p>If I go all in on you, are you gonna call me</p>
<p>and risk like, you know, guaranteed pay jumps</p>
<p>of like moving up a few spots?</p>
<p>So really the question comes down to like,</p>
<p>are you the type of guy who just wants to inch up</p>
<p>or are you gonna go for it?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re gonna go for the win.</p>
<p>I think ultimately there&rsquo;s some value</p>
<p>in being the guy who says,</p>
<p>you know, I don&rsquo;t care if I come seventh.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not worried about going from seventh to fifth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here to win.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re saying like the guys that win</p>
<p>will often be the ones that call there.</p>
<p>So like, they&rsquo;re not just bullying the small stacks, they&rsquo;re.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re the ones,</p>
<p>no, they&rsquo;re the ones that are willing to risk it, right?</p>
<p>So there are some people who, you know,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s five left, you know,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re third in chips</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s two guys very short</p>
<p>and you, you know, they&rsquo;ll have ace king</p>
<p>and someone moves, they&rsquo;ll just fold.</p>
<p>They fold the hand because they wanna wait</p>
<p>for those two other players to get broke.</p>
<p>And that way they let you know, they make actual money.</p>
<p>So you, I guess the thought process</p>
<p>between winning first place</p>
<p>and winning the most amount of money are different.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re conflicting, right?</p>
<p>Because in order to like win,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re just, if your focus is only on winning</p>
<p>the tournament, you will make mistakes financially</p>
<p>where you had guaranteed income for just folding, right?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say a guy has one chip left, you know, one chip</p>
<p>and me and you have good chips</p>
<p>and I go all in with you and I lose.</p>
<p>Now that guy, you know, got the guaranteed,</p>
<p>you know, he got the pay jump that I wouldn&rsquo;t have got.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some extremely stupid mistakes</p>
<p>you can make from a financial perspective,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s often at odds with, you know,</p>
<p>giving yourself the best chance to actually come first.</p>
<p>And in a tournament, especially the main event,</p>
<p>especially the final table, it&rsquo;s all about coming in first.</p>
<p>Well, I know because most of the people who make it,</p>
<p>so like, you know, when you play these high rollers,</p>
<p>these guys are accustomed to playing for a hundred thousand,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re accustomed to this kind of money.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re going to play, right?</p>
<p>For the most, but you&rsquo;re talking about guys</p>
<p>who bought into a $10,000 tournament,</p>
<p>maybe never had a hundred K cash in their life.</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;re sitting there and it&rsquo;s like 1 million</p>
<p>for fifth and 2 million for fourth.</p>
<p>So like, they don&rsquo;t want to be fifth,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just going to sit there and go, ah, I don&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll, they&rsquo;ll be under more financial pressure</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not like your typical high roller</p>
<p>type player.</p>
<p>Are you still able to find the guts to take big risks?</p>
<p>Yeah, see, I&rsquo;m trying to win.</p>
<p>Like, I think that gives me an advantage, frankly,</p>
<p>where I might make decisions that are financially suboptimal</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m trying to win,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also an inherent advantage to that.</p>
<p>Like that again, something I watched and learned</p>
<p>from a guy like Michael Adamo,</p>
<p>where he takes advantage of these people playing</p>
<p>so passively in these spots where he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m not trying to come, I&rsquo;m going to win.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to bull bulldoze you.</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;m not worried about, you know,</p>
<p>the small financial mistake of, you know, a pay jump.</p>
<p>What advice could you give to, to beginning poker players?</p>
<p>Actually at every level, how to get better,</p>
<p>how to improve, how to improve their game.</p>
<p>Obviously, as you said,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easiest to get better in the beginning,</p>
<p>but what advice would you give how to get better?</p>
<p>So one of the ways, I mean,</p>
<p>I think way back to the how I started, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so many resources and tools available right now</p>
<p>to analyze hands, but when you play, right?</p>
<p>And you find yourself in a situation or a hand</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not really sure about,</p>
<p>not because you had aces and went all in and you lost,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s not interesting,</p>
<p>but an interesting situation where you&rsquo;re not sure</p>
<p>what you did, jot the hand down, write it out.</p>
<p>And then either A, you know, use some of the tools,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s the solvers, if you&rsquo;re advanced enough,</p>
<p>or ask your group, you know,</p>
<p>like have a couple of friends at your level</p>
<p>and talk through the different decisions</p>
<p>and start to learn that way, right?</p>
<p>Cause those mistakes that you make</p>
<p>or those tough, those tough hands,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where the real learning comes from.</p>
<p>Like, so that next, so basically if you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re gonna be in similar scenarios.</p>
<p>In poker, you&rsquo;re rarely gonna have the identical situation,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ll have situations that are similar.</p>
<p>You know, you raise with ace king, someone three bet,</p>
<p>another guy goes all in.</p>
<p>Okay, well, what do I do in that spot?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re gonna have similar situations</p>
<p>in the future as well.</p>
<p>So figuring that out, the more you can do that,</p>
<p>you chop away at, you know,</p>
<p>different strategical mistakes, you know,</p>
<p>you used to make that you no longer make.</p>
<p>Are there resources like your masterclasses really is great?</p>
<p>Are there books?</p>
<p>So there was a guy named Michael Acevedo.</p>
<p>This is my, again, for a little bit more advanced players,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a book called a modern poker theory,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>which sort of explains game theory, right?</p>
<p>To the novice, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a little bit, I think if you&rsquo;re new to poker,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably above the rim for you.</p>
<p>But once you start to get a little better</p>
<p>and you wanna understand how to do it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably a good resource for as far as books.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also like tons of people</p>
<p>who stream poker, professional players.</p>
<p>And then you can get in there and you get in on the chat</p>
<p>and you start talking, you ask them,</p>
<p>you see people, you know,</p>
<p>explaining their thought process and things like that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many free resources.</p>
<p>And of course my masterclass,</p>
<p>I think does a good job of sort of compartmentalizing,</p>
<p>like, you know, how to attack it on a deeper level.</p>
<p>And we, you know, we get it, I try to get into,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s funny when I did the masterclass,</p>
<p>I asked them, I was like, well, you know,</p>
<p>how high end do you want this in terms of poker?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, we want really, really high end.</p>
<p>And I was like, okay, sure.</p>
<p>Then I started to explain really, really high end.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay, well, maybe the one below that, right?</p>
<p>So I try to explain really complex, you know,</p>
<p>theory in a more palatable way, in English, if you will.</p>
<p>Cause some of these kids, you hear them talk</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d be like, huh?</p>
<p>But you also, which is really nice, give example hands</p>
<p>that really illustrate the point, which is really nice.</p>
<p>You also wrote a book, I think 10 years ago,</p>
<p>Power Holding Strategy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to think how much of the stuff</p>
<p>in that book still applies, how much doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Listen, I still think the book holds up to a certain degree.</p>
<p>Obviously like, you know, it isn&rsquo;t optimal</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s like a more advanced strategies.</p>
<p>And if you played that way,</p>
<p>people will figure out a way to exploit you.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re like an average player playing</p>
<p>an average buy ins, like that&rsquo;s sort of what I coined,</p>
<p>like small ball approach, absolutely will work.</p>
<p>You know, at the highest level,</p>
<p>you have to add much more, a lot more bluffing.</p>
<p>But overall, I think it&rsquo;s still, you know,</p>
<p>for the most part, there&rsquo;s a lot of really,</p>
<p>especially with tournaments,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of really good principles in the book.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference in the dynamics,</p>
<p>if you could just comment on between a heads up poker</p>
<p>and when multiple people are in one hand,</p>
<p>what are interesting aspects to everything</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking about from game theory</p>
<p>to exploitative strategies, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So the biggest difference when you play,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say nine handed, you know,</p>
<p>against eight other players and you know, heads up is,</p>
<p>first of all, just the type of hands</p>
<p>and the number of hands you&rsquo;re gonna have to play.</p>
<p>So the way that it works is if there&rsquo;s nine people,</p>
<p>two out of the nine hands, you have to put in money.</p>
<p>And the other seven, you could just fold for nothing, okay?</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re heads up,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re forced to put money in every single hand, okay?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s only one other hand in front of you,</p>
<p>which means the ranges of hands that you play</p>
<p>is way wider, right?</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re nine handed, right?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re in first position, you&rsquo;re like, all right,</p>
<p>what do I need to play?</p>
<p>Like a good pair, you know, two high cards suited,</p>
<p>a big ace, you know, stuff like that, that&rsquo;s it, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re gonna play, right?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re gonna fold all the rest.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re heads up, you look at a king and a two</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, well, I gotta play this.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re gonna, you&rsquo;re gonna,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re forced to play a lot more hands</p>
<p>in a lot more complex situations</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re playing heads up,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re gonna be playing much far weaker hands.</p>
<p>Queen five, Jack three, all these types of hands.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re gonna see flops where you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna have the luxury of being like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in there with a premium hand, queens, kings, aces.</p>
<p>Those are easier to play, right?</p>
<p>Very, very strong holdings.</p>
<p>Heads up, you&rsquo;re forced to dance and fight a lot more.</p>
<p>You know, you can&rsquo;t sit in the weeds and wait.</p>
<p>What do you enjoy more?</p>
<p>Heads up is very intense.</p>
<p>I like heads up, but I think if you had to play heads up</p>
<p>eight, 10 hours, it&rsquo;s so mentally draining</p>
<p>because your face with so many constant decisions</p>
<p>each and every spot.</p>
<p>Like you play nine handed, you look at a nine and a three,</p>
<p>you throw it away, you hang out for a bit, relax,</p>
<p>you go, you get a little break and then play hand.</p>
<p>Heads up, you&rsquo;re like, it&rsquo;s like, boom, boom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re in the ring, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in the octagon and you&rsquo;re facing like</p>
<p>haymakers nonstop.</p>
<p>Since we talked about online a bit,</p>
<p>is it possible to cheat in poker, especially online?</p>
<p>So we offline also talked about the cheating controversy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going on in the chess world.</p>
<p>Is it possible to use, what is it?</p>
<p>Remotely connected anal beads to somehow cheat?</p>
<p>No, is that a concern of cheating online?</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the thing, it&rsquo;s kind of like romanticized</p>
<p>from the old days, like, you know, in the Western stuff,</p>
<p>like people trying to cheat.</p>
<p>And have you ever killed a man because he cheated?</p>
<p>No, I have not.</p>
<p>But when I started out as a teenager,</p>
<p>I played in a game with a bunch of Italians</p>
<p>and I knew they cheated and I didn&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>because they were so bad that I could win anyway.</p>
<p>I was like, I knew they would cheat,</p>
<p>but I knew how they were cheating.</p>
<p>So I was like, all right, you guys suck.</p>
<p>But so here&rsquo;s the thing,</p>
<p>anytime you&rsquo;re talking about large sums of money,</p>
<p>there will be people looking to take advantage,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s live or online, right?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like the job essentially of the, you know,</p>
<p>the online operators or the, you know, live event staff</p>
<p>to police it the best they can.</p>
<p>And the players themselves being on the lookout for it.</p>
<p>You know, like a guy like Dole Brunson is a great resource</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s seen it all and he&rsquo;s seen all the tricks,</p>
<p>you know, and so live, you know,</p>
<p>he probably could spot a few things.</p>
<p>But online, there&rsquo;s various ways people can try to cheat,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also really good security measures in place</p>
<p>to catch them, you know?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve caught, you know, like about two years ago,</p>
<p>there was a huge undertaking of like 500 accounts</p>
<p>that were banned for doing different things.</p>
<p>And, you know, there&rsquo;s, and again, you can&rsquo;t go in,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t go into detail in terms of how they&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>Cause otherwise, you know, then you&rsquo;re sort of giving</p>
<p>the cheats the playbook in terms of how to take advantage.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s always gonna be a concern for poker</p>
<p>wherever you play, right?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;m worried about personally.</p>
<p>So at the highest in person, and by the way,</p>
<p>online there&rsquo;s really interesting algorithms</p>
<p>that do some of the work in an automated way</p>
<p>to detect, to flag things that are weird.</p>
<p>But in person, it&rsquo;s just not something at the highest level</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re super concerned about.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not, it didn&rsquo;t quite infiltrate the poker world</p>
<p>to a degree where it&rsquo;s a huge concern.</p>
<p>Yeah, like, so here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t play in private games and whatever, right?</p>
<p>But in private games, theoretically, you know,</p>
<p>you could be in, if you don&rsquo;t trust the people</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re playing with, like I&rsquo;ve heard stories of people</p>
<p>where, you know, they have an earpiece in</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t see, right?</p>
<p>And they have, you know, like RFID on the cards</p>
<p>or something like that, and they have a phone reading it.</p>
<p>So they have somebody in a truck telling them,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna win this hand, you&rsquo;re gonna lose this hand.</p>
<p>Like that happened in a private game.</p>
<p>You know, and the guy, what&rsquo;s often funny</p>
<p>about some of these people who cheat is they&rsquo;re so greedy</p>
<p>and blatantly obvious that they get caught.</p>
<p>Where if they use this tool in a more subtle way,</p>
<p>they could probably continue to get away with it.</p>
<p>But again, that&rsquo;s not something I worry about</p>
<p>in a casino environment, you know, in these tournaments</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>But if I was playing in private games,</p>
<p>like if I came down to Texas and some guy,</p>
<p>I got cheated in a game by a guy named Blackie Blackburn</p>
<p>and Tex, I was at the Chimo Hotel, I was a teenager</p>
<p>and they saw me playing, you know,</p>
<p>I was making good money as a teenager.</p>
<p>I had like a $13,000 bankroll, you know,</p>
<p>and I went and played in this game with them</p>
<p>in a private hotel room and found out later</p>
<p>that the guy was a card mechanic, you know,</p>
<p>he was dealing and he could, you know, deal you the hands</p>
<p>and he knew what you had and stuff like that.</p>
<p>So yeah, I remember, you know,</p>
<p>I lost a big number in that game</p>
<p>and it was a good learning lesson in terms of, you know,</p>
<p>being wary of who you trust.</p>
<p>Yeah, so if the dealer is in on it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one way you could cheat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of the reason that they cut.</p>
<p>So like, you&rsquo;ll see like, there&rsquo;s a burn card</p>
<p>because what would happen in, you know,</p>
<p>maybe in the old days is like,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re sitting in the one seat,</p>
<p>I could lift the card and you could see it,</p>
<p>the next card coming, right?</p>
<p>So what they do is they have a card on top of it</p>
<p>that you burn that isn&rsquo;t the card</p>
<p>and then the next card is the one that comes face up.</p>
<p>I just learned about the edge sorting thing</p>
<p>that Phil Ivey and maybe others were involved with.</p>
<p>I just, reading it at first was super interesting to me</p>
<p>that you can exploit the imperfections</p>
<p>in the printing of cards.</p>
<p>That was almost cool to me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s almost not cheating because it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>That needs to be a movie.</p>
<p>That needs to be a movie, yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, what happened with Phil Ivey in that whole case</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s a catastrophe, really.</p>
<p>It is such a horrible precedent.</p>
<p>Cause here&rsquo;s what he did.</p>
<p>Phil Ivey shows up at the casino says,</p>
<p>I want to play this game.</p>
<p>They say, okay, all right, I want to play with those decks.</p>
<p>They say, okay, they agree to everything that he says.</p>
<p>He never touches the cards.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t do anything outside of the fact</p>
<p>that your cards that you supplied</p>
<p>have imperfections on them and he can see them.</p>
<p>Okay, so that increases his chances of winning.</p>
<p>He could still lose theoretically, right?</p>
<p>Probably not, but he can lose.</p>
<p>In theory, it just gives him a little bit of an edge</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all stuff based on what you provided.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the idea that you offered a game, I accepted, I beat you</p>
<p>and now you want to free roll me?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s disgusting.</p>
<p>So for people who don&rsquo;t know, maybe you can elaborate</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just fascinating to me,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re exploiting the imperfections</p>
<p>in the card patterns on the back</p>
<p>and then they look different if you rotate it.</p>
<p>And the fascinating thing too, when you shuffle,</p>
<p>usually you don&rsquo;t rotate the cards</p>
<p>so that you can see the sort of</p>
<p>detect which cards are the strong cards by marking them</p>
<p>by through rotating them.</p>
<p>And the way you know they&rsquo;re rotated</p>
<p>is because of the pattern imperfections.</p>
<p>Yeah, so some of the cards, like you said,</p>
<p>like they had that pattern on it</p>
<p>and some of them, this was faulty cards on there,</p>
<p>were not cut properly.</p>
<p>So like the eights and nines had the card cut differently</p>
<p>and those are important cards in this game,</p>
<p>the eights and nines or whatever.</p>
<p>So you could essentially,</p>
<p>from looking at the back of the card,</p>
<p>discern what it&rsquo;s gonna be.</p>
<p>You do nothing in terms of like cheating yourself.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not rigging the game.</p>
<p>All you&rsquo;re doing is taking advantage of the fact</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re playing, you&rsquo;ve offered me cards</p>
<p>that are faulty.</p>
<p>Can I just say that, of course, it would be Phil Ivey,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the goat at the normal game</p>
<p>who will figure out this particular thing.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what, if you&rsquo;re into soccer,</p>
<p>this Diego Maradona has that famous hand of God</p>
<p>in the World Cup where he scores a goal with his hand.</p>
<p>And so, of course, the referee didn&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>They thought it was a header.</p>
<p>So, I mean, part of the magic of the genius</p>
<p>of the people at the top of the game</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re able to exploit all the flaws that are there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a beautiful thing to see.</p>
<p>Well, see, Phil had, in his heyday,</p>
<p>he had, he exploited weaknesses in casinos,</p>
<p>systems all over the country.</p>
<p>Like in one night, I don&rsquo;t know if you know this story.</p>
<p>In one night, he would take a plane, a private plane,</p>
<p>and fly to 30 different casinos all over the country.</p>
<p>Cause he would have these deals where they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>all right, we&rsquo;ve got this big rich sucker</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s gonna come here and play craps</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s gonna lose all our money.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;d have this deal with one of the casinos</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;d be like, all right,</p>
<p>you get 20% back up to half a million, right?</p>
<p>So if you lose half a million, we&rsquo;ll give you back 100K.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;d go to one casino in Tunica,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d play half a million, win, win or lose, he would leave.</p>
<p>They think they&rsquo;re gonna get him to stay,</p>
<p>they get him a big room or whatever.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say he goes to Tunica, he loses half a million.</p>
<p>Now he goes, he flies to Atlantic city,</p>
<p>he wins half a million.</p>
<p>He lost half a million and won half a million,</p>
<p>but he got 100,000 back.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s actually plus 100,000.</p>
<p>Do that at 10 casinos a night,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making a million dollars in free equity.</p>
<p>And they would give him promotional chips</p>
<p>and all these kinds of things and free flights</p>
<p>and stuff like that.</p>
<p>So he took advantage of the image</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re trying to exploit.</p>
<p>So this is why I don&rsquo;t have any empathy for these casinos.</p>
<p>Cause they&rsquo;re giving you free drinks,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re giving you, why do you think they&rsquo;re doing that?</p>
<p>The kindness of their heart.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to exploit you.</p>
<p>So guess what?</p>
<p>You lost at your own game, pay the piper.</p>
<p>And I think it was crazy.</p>
<p>Cause the judges in his case said,</p>
<p>he did not cheat, but yeah, it&rsquo;s probably not right.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>You just said he didn&rsquo;t cheat.</p>
<p>That should be the end of the case.</p>
<p>And then the casinos do the funny thing.</p>
<p>I mentioned to you, I was just at the UFC</p>
<p>and Dana White is a huge gambler.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a blackjack gambler.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s that famous situation</p>
<p>where you got kicked out of a casino</p>
<p>and the casinos do that kind of thing</p>
<p>when you win too much.</p>
<p>So he won some ridiculous amount of money.</p>
<p>He bets like, I mean, he plays like millions of dollars</p>
<p>on hands of blackjack, it&rsquo;s insane.</p>
<p>And so he won really big and he got kicked out.</p>
<p>Was he counting?</p>
<p>No, no, he wasn&rsquo;t counting.</p>
<p>So counting in blackjack here in Las Vegas</p>
<p>is like the only game where they actually</p>
<p>can ask you not to play.</p>
<p>So like basically if you&rsquo;re counting cards, right?</p>
<p>You could potentially have an edge in blackjack</p>
<p>and there are some professionals who do that,</p>
<p>but they get caught pretty quickly.</p>
<p>And then they say, you can play craps,</p>
<p>you can play whatever you want,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t play blackjack here anymore.</p>
<p>No, I think, I don&rsquo;t think Dana White is counting.</p>
<p>I think he was winning a lot.</p>
<p>I guess they can claim that they believe you&rsquo;re counting</p>
<p>because how do you really know if you&rsquo;re counting?</p>
<p>Well, they easily, they figure it out.</p>
<p>So basically they have an eye in the sky</p>
<p>and they can see, so if you&rsquo;re varying your bet size, right?</p>
<p>So there are certain spots where based on the cards</p>
<p>that are out, let&rsquo;s say for example,</p>
<p>a lot of the twos, threes and fours and fives</p>
<p>have been coming out.</p>
<p>So the deck is rich in face cards.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very good for the player, right?</p>
<p>So imagine you were betting 500 bucks</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden you up your bet to 2000 or 5,000</p>
<p>when the deck is rich.</p>
<p>They know when the deck is rich in high cards</p>
<p>because they keep a counter themselves.</p>
<p>So if they notice a player increasing their bet sizes</p>
<p>when the deck is good for them, it&rsquo;s a telltale sign.</p>
<p>Interesting, I don&rsquo;t think Dana White would be counting.</p>
<p>And so casinos don&rsquo;t kick you out</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t often kick you out.</p>
<p>Do they ever kick you out if you make too much money?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re playing millions of dollars that they.</p>
<p>Unless they, they would never kick you out</p>
<p>for making too much money, unless they suspect cheating.</p>
<p>Because why would they?</p>
<p>They have an advantage, they want the money back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like you go in there, win 10 million,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, oh no, that&rsquo;s enough for us.</p>
<p>What about if he was talking shit the whole time?</p>
<p>I wonder.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that would matter.</p>
<p>Because in the long run, they&rsquo;ll get the money back.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>You tweeted, if you watched Jersey Shore,</p>
<p>Family Vacation, we would probably get along really well.</p>
<p>What is it about, because I lived in Jersey for a while,</p>
<p>what is it about Jersey Shore characters that you love?</p>
<p>I just love that they&rsquo;re sort of, I love the debauchery.</p>
<p>I think Pauly D&rsquo;s a fun guy, you know,</p>
<p>and just like, it&rsquo;s just something like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s what do you call it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trash TV, it&rsquo;s a guilty pleasure.</p>
<p>But you can just watch the Snooki get drunk</p>
<p>and fallen all over herself or whatever.</p>
<p>Is that part, do you love that part of Vegas as well?</p>
<p>Not really, I don&rsquo;t go out and stuff,</p>
<p>but I just like the characters.</p>
<p>I like that they have unique personalities.</p>
<p>And I think we live in a world now</p>
<p>where people are more and more careful of what they say</p>
<p>and afraid of backlash and all that stuff.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of like an old school version of just like,</p>
<p>say what you feel, it&rsquo;s okay,</p>
<p>as long as your intent is good.</p>
<p>And they haven&rsquo;t been canceled, if you will, which is good,</p>
<p>but I feel like their type of behavior slowly but surely,</p>
<p>like, cause they got a lot of flack originally</p>
<p>for misrepresenting like Italian Americans</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>Like there was a lot of backlash about this</p>
<p>and how Italian Americans really are and blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>So they sort of were representing that group of people</p>
<p>and, you know, they received some backlash back in the day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge supporter of diversity</p>
<p>in all the beautiful forms that the human species</p>
<p>is able to generate.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s certainly one dimension.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the greatest Vegas movie, would you say?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s a difficult question,</p>
<p>but Fear of Loathing in Las Vegas,</p>
<p>Leaving Las Vegas, Casino.</p>
<p>I watch, cause anytime Casino&rsquo;s on randomly,</p>
<p>I always watch it.</p>
<p>Such a great movie.</p>
<p>It could be one of the Sharon Stone.</p>
<p>Sharon, frankly, Sharon Stone reminded me,</p>
<p>every time I would watch the movie,</p>
<p>it reminded me of my wife, Amanda, like totally.</p>
<p>I would see like the character and I was like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the Robert De Niro character in the film.</p>
<p>It was, I used to watch it through that lens, you know.</p>
<p>From like the depth of love that you have.</p>
<p>Just kind of, she was, I remember that she was like,</p>
<p>she was like, she lit up every room.</p>
<p>She does light up every room.</p>
<p>She goes there, everybody&rsquo;s attracted and drawn to her.</p>
<p>And she was kind of, when she was younger,</p>
<p>she was a little wild and crazy and whatnot.</p>
<p>So she reminded me of the Sharon Stone character.</p>
<p>And then the Robert De Niro character is trying to like</p>
<p>have a stable life, you know, and be that.</p>
<p>And that was me.</p>
<p>Who was the Joe Pesci in your life?</p>
<p>Well, there was a guy named,</p>
<p>there was a James Woods for sure, who was the Lester.</p>
<p>We called him, we actually called him Lester.</p>
<p>A few of my friends call him Lester.</p>
<p>The greasy guy who tried to get back in and all that.</p>
<p>But yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, one of my favorite scenes</p>
<p>is when they meet out in the desert</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like a 50, 50 odds</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna make it out alive in that.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, there&rsquo;s an epicness to that portrayal of Vegas.</p>
<p>I love, I mean, it&rsquo;s just totally,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s obviously more corporate now</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s different, but I love those movies.</p>
<p>I love all those movies, just seeing that life.</p>
<p>And like I said, if there was a period in time</p>
<p>that I could go back to and just experience it,</p>
<p>it would be that, you know, right around then.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be that, playing with a mob and not.</p>
<p>I think of like these crime shows today,</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re so unrealistic now</p>
<p>because if they&rsquo;re in an era that is now,</p>
<p>like none of this stuff can happen</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s cameras everywhere.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t like get away with these,</p>
<p>like killing somebody and jumping in a car</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna get caught, you know?</p>
<p>But in the 70s, you know, that stuff happened.</p>
<p>Across the line, you die.</p>
<p>Yeah, Lake Mead is recently like losing water</p>
<p>and like every couple of days</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re finding more and more bodies from that era.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>They really are.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re close with your mom.</p>
<p>What did you learn about life from your mom?</p>
<p>My mother was very generous.</p>
<p>My mother, she experienced joy through giving people food.</p>
<p>For the most part, my dad would get them drinks</p>
<p>and that was how she felt fulfilled, right?</p>
<p>She felt good when she like would cook for you.</p>
<p>And like, she&rsquo;d be that person you&rsquo;d come over</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;d be like, are you hungry?</p>
<p>And you say, no, no, no, I&rsquo;m okay.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s gonna put 15 things in front of you and you&rsquo;ll eat.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re gonna eat.</p>
<p>Cause everyone does that to be polite.</p>
<p>No, no, I&rsquo;m good.</p>
<p>But you know, they will start to eat.</p>
<p>And just her hospitality in that regard</p>
<p>and just being generous and like being a good host</p>
<p>to people and things like that, like.</p>
<p>How did that define, like help define who you are</p>
<p>as a person, that generosity?</p>
<p>Did it rub off on you?</p>
<p>It made me think about in my life</p>
<p>when it comes to like any sort of business deals</p>
<p>or things like that, I don&rsquo;t wanna get the best of it</p>
<p>in such a way where I screw the other person.</p>
<p>I genuinely don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d much rather you owe me than me owe you.</p>
<p>So if I hire people, they get paid more</p>
<p>than they&rsquo;re supposed to.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d rather them do that and work towards it</p>
<p>rather than feel underpaid.</p>
<p>Cause if they&rsquo;re underpaid, they&rsquo;ll likely under deliver.</p>
<p>Whereas if they feel overpaid,</p>
<p>then if I need them to do something special,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not gonna be like, hey, I don&rsquo;t get paid for that.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, you do.</p>
<p>You really do.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s certainly like played out in my life</p>
<p>where I set it up in such a way where I don&rsquo;t owe,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m owed, but that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Cause I can handle taking the worst of it in spots.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like being the person to, you know,</p>
<p>feel like I&rsquo;m indebted to others.</p>
<p>Yeah, in some way, the karma of that tends</p>
<p>to pay dividends in the longterm.</p>
<p>Somehow there&rsquo;s somebody up there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s keeping track in some kind of way.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to young people today</p>
<p>in high school and college?</p>
<p>How to have a career they can be proud of</p>
<p>or maybe how to have a life in general</p>
<p>they can be proud of?</p>
<p>I would say like your 20s is a good opportunity</p>
<p>to set yourself up for the rest of your life, right?</p>
<p>So while the 20s are a period where you wanna have fun</p>
<p>and you wanna experience youth,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also a good opportunity to start thinking about</p>
<p>what do you want your life to look like</p>
<p>in your 30s and your 40s, right?</p>
<p>So I feel like it&rsquo;s the best time</p>
<p>to really put yourself out there and take risks</p>
<p>and try to hit it, you know, whatever,</p>
<p>you know, like to work really, really hard</p>
<p>to set yourself up.</p>
<p>Because, and I said this at an event I was speaking at,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re like with poker,</p>
<p>when your bankroll is very, very small,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s replenishable, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to protect it as much</p>
<p>as you do once you&rsquo;ve got something, right?</p>
<p>Once you have a brand or you have money,</p>
<p>you have something like that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you wanna start protecting you.</p>
<p>But in your 20s is an opportunity</p>
<p>to just really sort of get, you know,</p>
<p>to work really, really hard to set yourself up,</p>
<p>you know, for the future.</p>
<p>I am concerned a little bit,</p>
<p>like every time I talk to kids today,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, what do you wanna be?</p>
<p>They all wanna be YouTubers or Instagram stars or rappers,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Like, okay, I was like, that&rsquo;s cool,</p>
<p>but like, there&rsquo;s only so many of those,</p>
<p>you know, that there can be.</p>
<p>So it might be worthwhile having</p>
<p>a little bit of a backup plan.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s easier to be successful on Instagram</p>
<p>and social media if you do something else.</p>
<p>And I would say this too.</p>
<p>One other thing I would say is,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t choose a profession or an idea</p>
<p>because you think it&rsquo;ll make you rich, right?</p>
<p>Pursue something that you actually love.</p>
<p>Because if you love it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re way more likely to become rich.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t, you do something that you don&rsquo;t actually enjoy.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re spending a lot of your life unhappy,</p>
<p>doing something you don&rsquo;t want,</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re not passionate about it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably not,</p>
<p>the chances of you being successful are much lower.</p>
<p>And also becoming rich,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve talked to a lot of rich people,</p>
<p>hang out with a lot of rich people,</p>
<p>is not going to be as fulfilling as you imagine.</p>
<p>If you arrive there by not doing the thing</p>
<p>that you love doing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the thing that you love doing is like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what makes life worth it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another quote, I can&rsquo;t remember who it was,</p>
<p>otherwise I would quote them,</p>
<p>but it says something to the effect of like,</p>
<p>if we believe in the lie that more is always better,</p>
<p>then we can never truly arrive.</p>
<p>Because wherever we are, more is better, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never understood,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been around rich people,</p>
<p>like you said, you know, the bill,</p>
<p>I never got, I can&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>Like, if you have a billion dollars,</p>
<p>why do you give a shit about money at all?</p>
<p>Like, and they&rsquo;re still like, oh, we made this deal,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, you know, we picked up 300,</p>
<p>who cares?</p>
<p>Like, your life is set.</p>
<p>Like, there is that bell curve, right?</p>
<p>Where obviously being in poverty, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s obviously a high rate of unhappiness,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a certain amount of money where you reach,</p>
<p>you know, where you reach a level of happiness,</p>
<p>and then too much, you find the people</p>
<p>that are searching for money to fulfill these holes,</p>
<p>it starts to go back down again.</p>
<p>Well, the getting more money could become a game,</p>
<p>like a sport, that&rsquo;s fun to play,</p>
<p>as long as you directly or indirectly acknowledge</p>
<p>that what you love is the game of it,</p>
<p>versus the actual attainment of money.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what it is, right?</p>
<p>For me, I&rsquo;ve never cared about money that much.</p>
<p>I just never did, otherwise I would have a lot more of it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s always, like, it&rsquo;s always been strange to me</p>
<p>how people that have that kind of money,</p>
<p>like, are cheap in any way, you know?</p>
<p>Like, they wouldn&rsquo;t donate 5,000 to a worthwhile charity,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, buddy, this,</p>
<p>like, when it changes your life, not,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even like, like, small things, like taxes.</p>
<p>Like, okay, you have $20 billion,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re worried about paying 33%, 30% to 31.</p>
<p>I get it, I get the point of it all,</p>
<p>but like, it literally has no effect on your life whatsoever.</p>
<p>Your life is unchanged, whether it&rsquo;s 31 or 33.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the negative of a lot of money,</p>
<p>is if it corrupts the way you see the world,</p>
<p>you start to be protective and so on.</p>
<p>I mean, part of the challenge of when you get a lot of money</p>
<p>is people start to treat you differently,</p>
<p>and so navigating that correctly is very challenging.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t change, remain the same person you always were,</p>
<p>because if you change, you start to,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s why power corrupts,</p>
<p>is you get a lot of power, you get a lot of fame,</p>
<p>you get a lot of money, you start to distrust people,</p>
<p>and you start to push away people</p>
<p>that are actually really close to you with trusting.</p>
<p>And you also, I think, you develop some biases</p>
<p>where you think, like, you&rsquo;re just this,</p>
<p>you know, you think, like, it was all you,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re a genius, and you&rsquo;re so great,</p>
<p>and all these other people who don&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just because they don&rsquo;t have what you have,</p>
<p>and then you start to view that group of people,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re impoverished or whatever is less than,</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re some great guru</p>
<p>where you could have just got lucky and bought Bitcoins</p>
<p>that you could have done anything,</p>
<p>and then you became super wealthy,</p>
<p>and then you have this Dunning Kruger effect,</p>
<p>where you think you know everything about everything.</p>
<p>And a lot of poker people have that,</p>
<p>and listen, I&rsquo;m probably guilty in some ways too,</p>
<p>thinking because you can figure out poker</p>
<p>and be great at that, that you could figure out anything.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s true, right?</p>
<p>I mean, we sort of, we genuinely feel like</p>
<p>people that reach the highest levels of poker</p>
<p>feel like they are intelligent.</p>
<p>So they will look at problem solving</p>
<p>and think that they have answers.</p>
<p>Well, you have to remind yourself that you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s best to see the world as you did just get lucky,</p>
<p>or at least from my perspective,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not better than anybody.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything wrong with, like,</p>
<p>acknowledging that you worked hard to get where you were.</p>
<p>Like, there isn&rsquo;t, but at the same time, like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not available to everybody in the same way.</p>
<p>You know, right time, right place.</p>
<p>Like, for me, my poker career</p>
<p>could have gone very differently, you know?</p>
<p>If things didn&rsquo;t work out, you know,</p>
<p>if I had some bad luck in the wrong times,</p>
<p>like, who knows where I&rsquo;d be?</p>
<p>So you said your brain crawl is pretty small in your 20s.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve been around a lot of people</p>
<p>you care a lot about who&rsquo;ve lost everything in poker.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that like?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s those low points of losing everything?</p>
<p>I think because I&rsquo;ve been there,</p>
<p>I have more empathy than I probably should for those people.</p>
<p>I really feel for them.</p>
<p>Cause I remember being in Vegas and being totally broke</p>
<p>and like a guy loaning me $400</p>
<p>and me like turning that 400 into 20,000, 400 bucks.</p>
<p>And it was like eternally grateful to that.</p>
<p>So when I have friends who go through that,</p>
<p>like I always try to consult them,</p>
<p>obviously what they really need is money for the most part.</p>
<p>But I remember saying no to one friend</p>
<p>because he didn&rsquo;t have a plan.</p>
<p>So I like to try to help them in that regard.</p>
<p>Like my buddy&rsquo;s like, can you stake me in this game?</p>
<p>And I was like, all right, well, how much do you,</p>
<p>then I was like, let&rsquo;s break down the math, bro.</p>
<p>You want me to stake you?</p>
<p>So you get 50% of the profit, right?</p>
<p>So I said, how much do you think you can make in this game?</p>
<p>How much does the biggest winners make?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, I can probably, you know,</p>
<p>I probably do like 20,000 a month in this game.</p>
<p>So, okay.</p>
<p>So you get half of that cause I get 10, right?</p>
<p>What is your monthly nut?</p>
<p>How much are you spending?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, I&rsquo;m renting this thing for 8,000.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re spending 17,000 a month.</p>
<p>So like, no matter what you&rsquo;re set up to fail.</p>
<p>Like this isn&rsquo;t going to work.</p>
<p>So I actually didn&rsquo;t give him the money.</p>
<p>And I was like, what you need to do to earn more money</p>
<p>is lower your monthly nut because it&rsquo;s too high.</p>
<p>It just, you know, it just doesn&rsquo;t mathematically add up.</p>
<p>So trying to set them right in that regard</p>
<p>is something that like I feel obliged to do,</p>
<p>especially if they&rsquo;re friends.</p>
<p>But what about the mental aspect of the struggle</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going through, the struggle you were going through?</p>
<p>Just, I mean, it&rsquo;s really rough to have no money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not for everybody.</p>
<p>This really isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Like a lot of people might, you know, listen to this</p>
<p>and think like, oh, I want to play poker.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, most people fail.</p>
<p>Most people who want to play in the NFL,</p>
<p>they spend their college years,</p>
<p>like most of them are not going to make it.</p>
<p>Most of you who try to play poker professionally</p>
<p>are going to fail and you&rsquo;re going to experience despair.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>There are those like in anything that have the passion,</p>
<p>have the knowhow, have the luck and all that sort of stuff.</p>
<p>And it all pans out, but you know, they&rsquo;re the minority.</p>
<p>And so for the low points, if you remember,</p>
<p>what does it take to sort of overcome that,</p>
<p>overcome the mental struggle?</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re making it sound like certain people</p>
<p>are just genetically able to in certain.</p>
<p>I do think some people are more apt to being able to deal</p>
<p>with like adversity and having resilience</p>
<p>and some people just can&rsquo;t hack it.</p>
<p>But like I generally, what I would advise,</p>
<p>you know, people that are, let&rsquo;s say a guy&rsquo;s playing,</p>
<p>you know, really high stakes or whatever,</p>
<p>doing badly is step number one is take,</p>
<p>take a little bit of a break here.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s recalibrate and let&rsquo;s start small again.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s, you know, let&rsquo;s restart</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s play smaller stakes</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s get our confidence back because in poker,</p>
<p>without confidence, you cannot be successful.</p>
<p>It is incredibly important to have almost an inflated level</p>
<p>of confidence in yourself</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re up against it, right?</p>
<p>As I said, the majority of people fail.</p>
<p>So why are you special?</p>
<p>Why are you different?</p>
<p>You have to be pretty confident about your, you know,</p>
<p>yourself to think that you are one of the chosen ones.</p>
<p>And then don&rsquo;t resist the despair and take a nap.</p>
<p>Definitely take a nap.</p>
<p>Listen, it&rsquo;s okay to experience it.</p>
<p>Like I said, yeah, you&rsquo;re going to experience despair.</p>
<p>What else would you, what should you be feeling?</p>
<p>You know, if things are going poorly</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve just lost all your money, excited?</p>
<p>Maybe like, okay, have your moment of grief,</p>
<p>allow yourself to experience it so that you can,</p>
<p>you know, reassemble.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fundamental way</p>
<p>in which you haven&rsquo;t really lived life</p>
<p>if you haven&rsquo;t experienced periods of despair.</p>
<p>You have a jaded view of the world, right?</p>
<p>Weird thing about the human condition</p>
<p>that both the highs and the lows are important.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What role does love play in the human condition,</p>
<p>Daniel Negrano?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good one.</p>
<p>What role has love played in your life?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, yeah, that&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>you sort of talked about the ups and downs</p>
<p>of the human condition and love has been that for me, right?</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m in a good place now,</p>
<p>but you know, even with my now wife years ago,</p>
<p>you know, she was young, she was, you know, new to poker</p>
<p>and she wasn&rsquo;t ready to settle down.</p>
<p>I was like, when I met her, I think I was 31, she was 21.</p>
<p>And I was ready to like lock her up, if you will, you know,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s do this.</p>
<p>And I bought a ring way back when she was like,</p>
<p>not about that.</p>
<p>She was living the Hollywood life.</p>
<p>She was living, you know, partying in LA,</p>
<p>doing that kind of stuff and wasn&rsquo;t ready.</p>
<p>And we split and that one hit me hard.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t realize how much of a hit</p>
<p>that had on my confidence in my, in everything really,</p>
<p>in poker, with other women.</p>
<p>It had me a little jaded about women too, you know,</p>
<p>resentful, you know, and it took a lot of like self,</p>
<p>I did like a lot of personal growth work</p>
<p>and workshops and things like that.</p>
<p>And then didn&rsquo;t see her for years.</p>
<p>And she came back to town, I was a much different person.</p>
<p>It was just, you know, four years ago or something like that.</p>
<p>And she was too, went to dinner.</p>
<p>A few months later, we were married.</p>
<p>It worked out so different because we both had to grow,</p>
<p>you know, and become different people.</p>
<p>And that love was still there somehow.</p>
<p>Yeah, like she went through her relationships.</p>
<p>I went through mine, you know, we experienced life</p>
<p>and I was married once before too, you know,</p>
<p>called my starter marriage, if you will,</p>
<p>which yeah, you know, we just, you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think like until you do it, until you get married</p>
<p>and you know, experience like the sacrifice,</p>
<p>not necessarily the sacrifices, but your value systems,</p>
<p>if they don&rsquo;t align identically,</p>
<p>which they&rsquo;re not going to, someone like me,</p>
<p>probably one of my strengths in poker,</p>
<p>but my weaknesses in relationship is judgment, right?</p>
<p>When I play poker, I need to judge you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s essentially what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gauging who you are and what you&rsquo;re good at</p>
<p>and what you&rsquo;re bad at.</p>
<p>And that can have repercussions because it leads,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how I view, that&rsquo;s the lens I look at everyone with</p>
<p>based on how you live your life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m judging you, this guy&rsquo;s this, this guy&rsquo;s that,</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s that, and that&rsquo;s not healthy.</p>
<p>So you have to shut that off.</p>
<p>You have to learn to like, and the thing,</p>
<p>I finally realized what love is, frankly for me,</p>
<p>with her is no judgment, right?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s so like, yeah, so I have my way of being, right?</p>
<p>If she wants to have cereal for dinner,</p>
<p>babe, that&rsquo;s the best decision for her.</p>
<p>I was living in a framework of better and worse.</p>
<p>The way that I do things is better and yours is worse,</p>
<p>do things more like I do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>True acceptance and true love is accepting someone</p>
<p>like exactly as they are.</p>
<p>You know, if she wants to do something different,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to support her, whatever it is.</p>
<p>Even if I disagree with it personally,</p>
<p>and like the way that I would do things,</p>
<p>learning to just realize that she&rsquo;s had a different journey</p>
<p>and a different walk towards where she&rsquo;s at than I have.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t pass my judgments on other people like that.</p>
<p>I believe it is ethically wrong</p>
<p>and probably illegal to eat cereal for dinner.</p>
<p>Listen, if she wants it, she wants it.</p>
<p>Acceptance.</p>
<p>Like when she goes to bed, like all these little things,</p>
<p>but my regimented life, she&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Like our motto at our wedding was like,</p>
<p>you keep me wild, I&rsquo;ll keep you safe, you keep me wild.</p>
<p>I keep her safe, she keeps me wild.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like not organized and anal and all those kind</p>
<p>of things, I am.</p>
<p>She helps me like let loose.</p>
<p>You know, oh no, I&rsquo;m eating this, this.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, have some popcorn.</p>
<p>Like, all right, let&rsquo;s do it, you know?</p>
<p>She keeps me freed.</p>
<p>And accepting that, embracing that,</p>
<p>the difference is the chaos of it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes it.</p>
<p>Like I literally do think about with her,</p>
<p>how important it is and how much I try to like just come</p>
<p>from neutral and like compassion and never judge.</p>
<p>Cause she&rsquo;s got other things that she deals with, right?</p>
<p>That I don&rsquo;t, she&rsquo;s bipolar, right?</p>
<p>So with that, I&rsquo;ve studied and I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about,</p>
<p>you know, sort of mental health and what that means</p>
<p>and ways in which a lot of characteristics</p>
<p>about somebody is completely out of their control</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re bipolar, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s swings, like there&rsquo;s no cocktail</p>
<p>for bipolar that solves the issue, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s medications that work to, you know,</p>
<p>level you out for periods of time,</p>
<p>but then they start to fade and they don&rsquo;t work as well.</p>
<p>So they constantly need readjustment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an unsolved mystery to a certain degree.</p>
<p>So in some sense, you know,</p>
<p>her diagnosis made our relationship easier</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t take anything personal, right?</p>
<p>I realized that sometimes she&rsquo;s gonna be in a mood.</p>
<p>I mean, she&rsquo;s so good about communicating it though.</p>
<p>She tells me some morning she&rsquo;ll be like bad mood</p>
<p>trying to get out of it, babe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay, I leave her alone.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>That means she&rsquo;s grown to be able to communicate,</p>
<p>to understand, to self reflect, to understand where she is.</p>
<p>I have people in my life who I love who are bipolar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful ride.</p>
<p>It is, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s, yeah, the highs and the lows are there.</p>
<p>So, but yeah, like, because I feel like a protector.</p>
<p>For me, I just want to be a rock, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of the whole serial thing.</p>
<p>If she wants to eat cereal,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t make a wrong for anything she wants to do.</p>
<p>What have you learned from life</p>
<p>from the song, The Gambler by Kenny Rogers?</p>
<p>You got to know when to hold them,</p>
<p>know when to fold them,</p>
<p>know when to walk away, know when to run.</p>
<p>You never count your money when you&rsquo;re sitting at the table.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be plenty of time for counting</p>
<p>when the dealing&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>Is that, do you live by those words or?</p>
<p>The first part of it for sure.</p>
<p>What do they even mean?</p>
<p>Cause.</p>
<p>You got to know when to hold, know when.</p>
<p>So basically it&rsquo;s like, all right, you know, in life,</p>
<p>like, you know, let&rsquo;s say, let&rsquo;s use a, whatever,</p>
<p>the market, for example, you bought a stock, right?</p>
<p>Or you bought Bitcoin and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to go to the moon, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, well, maybe things have changed.</p>
<p>New scenario, new circumstances, new situation.</p>
<p>Are you going down with the ship, right?</p>
<p>Or are you going to lay the hand down?</p>
<p>Are you going to fold it?</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s a relationship, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re with this woman, you&rsquo;re like, all right,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s time to fold this one.</p>
<p>I think, you know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that we&rsquo;re going to be able to make this,</p>
<p>this hand work right now.</p>
<p>When to fold them and when to run.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So maybe every gambler knows that the secret to surviving</p>
<p>is knowing what to throw away and knowing what to keep</p>
<p>because every hand&rsquo;s a winner and every hand&rsquo;s a loser.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a stoic philosophy.</p>
<p>And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.</p>
<p>Every hand&rsquo;s a winner and every hand&rsquo;s a loser.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>I like that one.</p>
<p>I like, for me, that&rsquo;s like the difference between victim</p>
<p>and responsible, like the way that I think about it, right?</p>
<p>You can be a victim to circumstance</p>
<p>or you can be responsible for everything in your life, right?</p>
<p>So when an event happens,</p>
<p>the event itself is neither good or bad</p>
<p>until you assign it value, right?</p>
<p>So like an event happens and it can be traumatic,</p>
<p>it can be, you know, painful,</p>
<p>but you know, how you respond to it</p>
<p>is ultimately going to be up to you.</p>
<p>Like you actually do have a choice.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the thing you can control.</p>
<p>The fact that you, Daniel Negrano took my commentary</p>
<p>about The Gambler seriously shows once more</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re a beautiful human being.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for being who you are,</p>
<p>for inspiring millions of people about poker,</p>
<p>about how to live life.</p>
<p>And thank you for giving me your valuable time today.</p>
<p>This is amazing.</p>
<p>Thanks for talking.</p>
