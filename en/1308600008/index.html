    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>My name is Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>This podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring you zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day,</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome,</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs,</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now</p>
<p>showing that vitamin D3 is essential</p>
<p>for various aspects of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are in Element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>how to change your nervous system for the better.</p>
<p>As you recall, your nervous system includes your brain</p>
<p>and your spinal cord,</p>
<p>but also all the connections that your brain and spinal cord</p>
<p>make with the organs of your body</p>
<p>and all the connections that the organs of your body</p>
<p>make with your brain and spinal cord.</p>
<p>Now, this thing that we call the nervous system</p>
<p>is responsible for everything we know,</p>
<p>all our behavior, all our emotions,</p>
<p>everything we feel about ourselves and the outside world,</p>
<p>everything we think and believe,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really at the center of our entire experience</p>
<p>of life and who we are.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in humans, unlike in other species,</p>
<p>we can change our nervous system</p>
<p>by taking some very specific and deliberate actions.</p>
<p>And today, we&rsquo;re really going to focus on the actions,</p>
<p>the motor commands and the aspects of movement and balance</p>
<p>that allow us to change our nervous system.</p>
<p>It turns out that movement and balance</p>
<p>actually provide windows or portals into our ability</p>
<p>to change our nervous system the way we want,</p>
<p>even if those changes are not about learning new movements</p>
<p>or learning how to balance, and soon you&rsquo;ll understand why.</p>
<p>So today, we&rsquo;re going to talk a lot about</p>
<p>the basic science of neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>I promise to not use excessive nomenclature,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be a little bit,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll try and make it as clear as possible.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re also going to talk a lot about protocols and tools</p>
<p>that the scientific literature points to</p>
<p>and supports for changing our nervous system.</p>
<p>Again, not just for sake of learning new motor movements</p>
<p>or how to balance better,</p>
<p>but for how to feel differently about particular experiences</p>
<p>both past, present and future,</p>
<p>as well as how to learn faster.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to discuss hacks, a word I loathe.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to discuss gimmicks.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to discuss mechanism and scientific data</p>
<p>and the tools that those mechanisms</p>
<p>and scientific data point to</p>
<p>so that you can tailor your practices around learning</p>
<p>to your specific needs and goals.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s begin by just examining the big picture question,</p>
<p>which is, does the brain control behavior?</p>
<p>And my hope is that everyone is immediately thinking yes.</p>
<p>The brain and nervous system, we really should say,</p>
<p>because the brain is just one component</p>
<p>of the nervous system, controls our behavior.</p>
<p>How does it do that?</p>
<p>Well, there are a couple of different levels</p>
<p>that it does that.</p>
<p>First of all, if we&rsquo;re talking about movement,</p>
<p>behavior generally means movement.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re talking about movement,</p>
<p>we have two categories of neurons</p>
<p>that are very important to think about</p>
<p>in the context of neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>First of all, we have what are called lower motor neurons.</p>
<p>These are motor neurons that live in our spinal cord.</p>
<p>If for the aficionados out there,</p>
<p>for those of you that might be head to medical school</p>
<p>or just want to learn more about the anatomy,</p>
<p>they live in the ventral horn of the spinal cord,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to know that,</p>
<p>just know that you have these things</p>
<p>called lower motor neurons.</p>
<p>These are neurons that are in the spinal cord,</p>
<p>but they extend a wire that we call an axon</p>
<p>out into the peripheral nervous system, into the body.</p>
<p>And those neurons connect with muscle.</p>
<p>They send electrical potentials out there</p>
<p>that allow our muscles to twitch and to contract.</p>
<p>As a little point of fact, actually,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have muscle memory.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no such thing as muscle memory.</p>
<p>Muscles are dumb.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know anything.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have a history.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have a memory.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know anything.</p>
<p>It is the neurons that control those muscles</p>
<p>and their firing patterns</p>
<p>in which all the information for motor patterns are stored.</p>
<p>So your ability to walk is not muscle memory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s neural memory.</p>
<p>Now, the lower motor neurons,</p>
<p>while smarter than the muscle, so to speak,</p>
<p>are not the most brilliant of the motor neurons.</p>
<p>They are generally involved in doing what they are told,</p>
<p>and they are told what to do from two sources.</p>
<p>We have circuits in our brainstem,</p>
<p>so this would be kind of around your neck,</p>
<p>deep in the brain,</p>
<p>that are called central pattern generators.</p>
<p>These are sometimes called CPGs.</p>
<p>Central pattern generators are what allow us</p>
<p>to generate repetitive patterns of movement.</p>
<p>So inhaling and exhaling, inhaling and exhaling,</p>
<p>subconsciously is controlled by a central pattern generator.</p>
<p>That just means a collection of neurons.</p>
<p>If you really want to know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re called the Prebotzinger neurons,</p>
<p>discovered by Jack Feldman and colleagues at UCLA.</p>
<p>These neurons in the brainstem send information</p>
<p>down the phrenic nerve and control the diaphragms,</p>
<p>and it goes inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have to think about that.</p>
<p>You could think about it,</p>
<p>and you could change the durations of inhales and exhales</p>
<p>and change that up,</p>
<p>but the motor neurons that control that</p>
<p>are just responding to what the brain is telling it to do.</p>
<p>The other central pattern generators</p>
<p>include things like walking.</p>
<p>The right limb, left limb, right limb, left limb pattern</p>
<p>that we normally associate with walking</p>
<p>was learned during childhood,</p>
<p>and these central pattern generators,</p>
<p>sometimes called CPGs,</p>
<p>tell our lower motor neurons, fire.</p>
<p>Now you fire, now you fire.</p>
<p>So they are literally saying right, left, right, left.</p>
<p>They are the marching orders from the brainstem</p>
<p>to the lower motor neurons.</p>
<p>So these lower motor neurons do what they are told.</p>
<p>They are obedient little soldiers,</p>
<p>and they do what they are told,</p>
<p>and their job is to make the muscles contract</p>
<p>at specific times.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s all simple,</p>
<p>but then there are the upper motor neurons.</p>
<p>The upper motor neurons actually reside in our motor cortex</p>
<p>way up on top of the brain,</p>
<p>and they are involved in sending signals</p>
<p>for deliberate action, okay?</p>
<p>So they send signals to the lower motor neurons,</p>
<p>which are the effectors,</p>
<p>the ones that actually control the muscles,</p>
<p>but the upper motor neurons</p>
<p>are the ones that send very specific signals.</p>
<p>For instance, the signals that would allow you</p>
<p>to make a cup of coffee in the morning</p>
<p>or to deliberately engage in any kind of behavior.</p>
<p>Now you can probably make a cup of coffee in the morning</p>
<p>without having to think about it too much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost reflexive for you now,</p>
<p>which means that a lot of the information</p>
<p>about how to perform that particular movement</p>
<p>has been passed off to circuitry</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s now more or less in the brainstem</p>
<p>and below the motor cortex.</p>
<p>Now, why am I giving you all this detail?</p>
<p>Well, if you want to change motor patterns,</p>
<p>you have to know where in the circuitry changes are possible</p>
<p>and you ought to know where the changes</p>
<p>are most likely to occur.</p>
<p>You also need to know how do you signal to the brain</p>
<p>and nervous system that a change is necessary.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just pause there,</p>
<p>return to the initial question that we started with,</p>
<p>which is, does the brain control behavior?</p>
<p>And the answer is yes, and now you know how.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s upper motor neurons, lower motor neurons.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got these things called central pattern generators</p>
<p>and some connection with the muscles.</p>
<p>So there you go.</p>
<p>You just got basically what was the equivalent</p>
<p>of the introduction to a college lecture</p>
<p>on motor control in the nervous system,</p>
<p>but the point today is all about plasticity.</p>
<p>How can that be leveraged in order to open up</p>
<p>this magical thing that we call plasticity</p>
<p>in order to access changes to our emotional experience</p>
<p>or to our belief system,</p>
<p>or to our ability to remember</p>
<p>and use specific kinds of information</p>
<p>for say math or language, et cetera?</p>
<p>Well, what I&rsquo;m not going to tell you</p>
<p>is that you need to go running or you need to go biking</p>
<p>or that simply going through motor patterns</p>
<p>is going to open up plasticity</p>
<p>because I hate to tell you this,</p>
<p>but as beneficial as exercise is,</p>
<p>it does not open plasticity unless you do certain things.</p>
<p>And I will tell you exactly</p>
<p>what those certain things are today.</p>
<p>To be clear, I think exercise is wonderful and healthy,</p>
<p>can improve cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>maintain strength, bone density, all that good stuff,</p>
<p>but just working out or doing your exercise of various kinds</p>
<p>will not change your nervous system.</p>
<p>It will maintain it</p>
<p>and it can certainly improve other health metrics,</p>
<p>but it is not going to open up the window for plasticity.</p>
<p>The question we need to ask is,</p>
<p>can behavior change the brain?</p>
<p>We already agreed that the brain can change behavior,</p>
<p>but can behavior change the brain?</p>
<p>And the answer is yes,</p>
<p>provided that behavior is different enough in specific ways</p>
<p>from the behaviors that you already know how to perform.</p>
<p>Let me repeat that.</p>
<p>Can behavior change the brain?</p>
<p>And the answer is yes,</p>
<p>provided that behavior is different enough</p>
<p>from the sorts of behaviors</p>
<p>that you already know how to perform.</p>
<p>And I should have added the word well,</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t obviously perform a behavior</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t know how to perform</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t know how to do it yet.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a key element to accessing neuroplasticity</p>
<p>that frankly, I don&rsquo;t see out there</p>
<p>in the general discussion about neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>In the general discussion about neuroplasticity</p>
<p>and about learning,</p>
<p>I hear all these gimmicks about using different ways</p>
<p>to remember lots of people&rsquo;s names</p>
<p>and arranging things into their first letters</p>
<p>and mnemonics and all this kind of stuff,</p>
<p>which frankly to me feels really gimmicky.</p>
<p>And I think that if you look at super learners,</p>
<p>they tend to be people that have a process</p>
<p>of say extreme memory,</p>
<p>but people who have extreme memory,</p>
<p>generally the literature shows us</p>
<p>are pretty poor at other things.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think most of us are interested</p>
<p>in walking around knowing how to remember everything.</p>
<p>In fact, there are some interesting studies</p>
<p>looking at humans who over-remember</p>
<p>and they suffer tremendously</p>
<p>because they remember all sorts of things</p>
<p>like the number at the top of the receipt</p>
<p>at the bodega that they bought a Coca-Cola 10 years ago.</p>
<p>This is useless information for most people.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t do well in life really.</p>
<p>So the goal isn&rsquo;t to remember everything,</p>
<p>the goal is to be selective about your brain changes.</p>
<p>And when we talk about brain changes,</p>
<p>I want to highlight adaptive changes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole category of things</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to discuss</p>
<p>when we talk about traumatic brain injury and dementia,</p>
<p>a topic for a future episode,</p>
<p>about all the things that happen</p>
<p>when you have damaged your nervous system</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re missing neurons.</p>
<p>But today I really want to talk about</p>
<p>something that I think is very near and dear</p>
<p>to many of your hearts,</p>
<p>which is what are the behaviors that you can engage in</p>
<p>to access neuroplasticity</p>
<p>so that then you can apply that plasticity</p>
<p>to the specific things that you want to learn or unlearn.</p>
<p>This is very important</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t want people to get the impression</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re really talking about</p>
<p>learning a bunch of motor movements.</p>
<p>You may be an athlete, you might not be an athlete.</p>
<p>You might want to learn how to dance, you might not.</p>
<p>You might want to learn how to dance</p>
<p>and get better at remembering</p>
<p>and learning languages, for instance,</p>
<p>or at unlearning some difficult emotional experience,</p>
<p>meaning you want to remove the emotional load</p>
<p>from a particular memory of an experience.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re talking about today is using behavior</p>
<p>as a gate to enter states of mind and body</p>
<p>that allow you to access plasticity.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about the different kinds of plasticity</p>
<p>that are available to us</p>
<p>because those will point directly</p>
<p>towards the type of protocols that we should engage in</p>
<p>to change ourselves for the better,</p>
<p>the so-called adaptive plasticity.</p>
<p>There is something called representational plasticity.</p>
<p>Representational plasticity</p>
<p>is just your internal representation of the outside world.</p>
<p>So you have a map of auditory space, believe it or not,</p>
<p>meaning you have neurons that respond</p>
<p>when something over on my right happens,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m snapping my fingers over to my right.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t snap as well on my left,</p>
<p>which is the whole thing into itself.</p>
<p>Yeah, weak over there on the left side.</p>
<p>But when I do that,</p>
<p>there are different neurons respond to those.</p>
<p>We have a map of visual space.</p>
<p>Certain neurons are seeing things</p>
<p>in certain portions of visual space and not others.</p>
<p>We have a map of motor space,</p>
<p>meaning when we move our limbs in particular directions,</p>
<p>we know where those limbs are</p>
<p>because even if we can&rsquo;t see them,</p>
<p>we have what&rsquo;s called proprioceptive feedback.</p>
<p>So we have knowledge about where our limbs are.</p>
<p>In fact, people that lack certain neurons</p>
<p>for proprioceptive feedback,</p>
<p>they are very poor at controlling their motor behavior.</p>
<p>They get injured a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a terrible situation.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got all these representations inside</p>
<p>and we have maps of our motor commands.</p>
<p>We know that, for instance,</p>
<p>if I want to reach out and grab the pen in front of me</p>
<p>that I need to generate a certain amount of force.</p>
<p>So I rarely overshoot.</p>
<p>I rarely miss the pen, okay?</p>
<p>So our maps of the motor world</p>
<p>and our maps of the sensory world are merged.</p>
<p>The way to create plasticity</p>
<p>is to create mismatches or errors in how we perform things.</p>
<p>And this I think is an amazing</p>
<p>and important feature of neuroplasticity</p>
<p>that is highly underappreciated.</p>
<p>The way to create plasticity</p>
<p>is to send signals to the brain that something is wrong,</p>
<p>something is different and something isn&rsquo;t being achieved.</p>
<p>And I think this will completely reframe</p>
<p>the way that most people think about plasticity.</p>
<p>Most of us think about plasticity as,</p>
<p>okay, we&rsquo;re going to get into this optimal learning state</p>
<p>or flow and then suddenly we&rsquo;re going to be able</p>
<p>to do all the things that we wish that we could do.</p>
<p>Well, I hate to break it to you,</p>
<p>but flow is an expression of what we already know how to do.</p>
<p>It is not a state for learning.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m willing to go to bat</p>
<p>with any of the flow-anistas out there</p>
<p>that want to challenge me on that one.</p>
<p>Flow is an expression of nervous system capabilities</p>
<p>that are already embedded in us.</p>
<p>Errors and making errors out of sync</p>
<p>with what we would like to do</p>
<p>is how our nervous system is cued</p>
<p>through very distinct biological mechanisms</p>
<p>that something isn&rsquo;t going right.</p>
<p>And therefore certain neurochemicals are deployed</p>
<p>that signal the neural circuits that they have to change.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about the experiments</p>
<p>that support what I just said,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m about to tell you that making errors</p>
<p>over and over and over again</p>
<p>is the route to shaping your nervous system</p>
<p>so that it performs better and better and better.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not going to tell you that the last rep of a set</p>
<p>where you hit failure in the gym</p>
<p>is anything like neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>You hear that too,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s pushing to that point of a cliff</p>
<p>where you just can&rsquo;t function anymore.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the signal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the signal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a distinct neuromuscular phenomenon</p>
<p>that bears zero resemblance</p>
<p>to what it takes to get neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about errors and making errors</p>
<p>and why and how that triggers the release of chemicals</p>
<p>that then allow us to not just learn the thing</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re doing in the motor sense,</p>
<p>play the piano, dance, et cetera,</p>
<p>but it also creates an environment,</p>
<p>a milieu within the brain that allows us to then go</p>
<p>learn how to couple or uncouple a particular emotion</p>
<p>to an experience or better language learning</p>
<p>or better mathematical learning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really fundamental aspect of how we&rsquo;re built.</p>
<p>And when you look at it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually very straightforward.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a series of logical steps</p>
<p>that once you learn how to open those hatches,</p>
<p>it becomes very straightforward to deploy.</p>
<p>Last episode, we discussed some of the basic principles</p>
<p>of neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t hear that episode, no problem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just review it quickly,</p>
<p>which is that it&rsquo;s a falsehood that everything that we do</p>
<p>and experience changes our brain.</p>
<p>The brain changes when certain neurochemicals,</p>
<p>namely acetylcholine, epinephrine, and dopamine</p>
<p>are released in ways and in the specific times</p>
<p>that allow for neural circuits to be marked for change.</p>
<p>And then the change occurs later during sleep.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll review that later,</p>
<p>but basically you need a certain cocktail of chemicals</p>
<p>released in the brain in order for a particular behavior</p>
<p>to reshape the way that our brain works.</p>
<p>So the question really is,</p>
<p>what allows those neurochemicals to be released?</p>
<p>And last episode, it talked all about focus.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t seen or heard that episode,</p>
<p>you might want to check it out</p>
<p>about some specific tools and practices</p>
<p>that can allow you to build up your capacity for focus</p>
<p>and release certain chemicals in that cocktail.</p>
<p>But today we&rsquo;re going to talk about the other chemicals</p>
<p>in the cocktail, in particular dopamine.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re really going to center our discussion</p>
<p>around this issue of making errors</p>
<p>and why making errors is actually the signal</p>
<p>that tells the brain, okay, it&rsquo;s time to change.</p>
<p>Or more generally, it&rsquo;s time to pay attention to things</p>
<p>so that you change.</p>
<p>And I really want to distinguish this point really clearly,</p>
<p>which is that I&rsquo;m going to talk today a lot about motor</p>
<p>and vestibular, meaning balance programs,</p>
<p>but not just for learning motor commands and balance,</p>
<p>not just for learning new motor skills and balance,</p>
<p>but also for setting a stage</p>
<p>or a kind of condition in your brain</p>
<p>where you can go learn other things as well.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about some classic experiments</p>
<p>that really nail down what&rsquo;s most important</p>
<p>in this discussion about plasticity.</p>
<p>So I mentioned last episode,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll just tell you right now,</p>
<p>again, the brain is incredibly plastic</p>
<p>from about birth until about age 25.</p>
<p>Passive experience will shape the brain</p>
<p>just because of the way that the chemicals</p>
<p>that are sloshing around in there</p>
<p>and the way that the neurons are arranged</p>
<p>and all sorts of things.</p>
<p>The brain&rsquo;s job is to customize itself</p>
<p>in response to its experience.</p>
<p>And then somewhere about 25,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like the day after</p>
<p>your 26th birthday, plasticity closes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of tapering off of plasticity</p>
<p>and you need different mechanisms</p>
<p>to engage plasticity as an adult.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re mostly going to be talking</p>
<p>about adult plasticity today,</p>
<p>but I got a lot of questions about,</p>
<p>well, what about if I&rsquo;m younger than 25?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I wish I had a time machine, but I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Because as I&rsquo;ve said before,</p>
<p>the stinger is when you&rsquo;re young,</p>
<p>your brain is very plastic,</p>
<p>but you have less control over your experience.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re older, generally,</p>
<p>you have more control over your experience,</p>
<p>but your brain is less plastic.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re already asking the question</p>
<p>as a 20-year-old or a 15-year-old,</p>
<p>what can I do now that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>enhanced my brain?</p>
<p>I guess the simple question would answer, excuse me,</p>
<p>would be an aside,</p>
<p>which we get the broadest education you can possible.</p>
<p>That means math, chemistry, physics, literature, music,</p>
<p>learn how to play an instrument.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying that because I wish I had, et cetera.</p>
<p>Get a broad training in a number of things</p>
<p>and find the thing that really captures</p>
<p>your passion and excitement,</p>
<p>and then put a ton of additional effort there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I recommend,</p>
<p>including emotional development.</p>
<p>Maybe a topic for a future episode.</p>
<p>But if you are an adult,</p>
<p>or if you are a young person,</p>
<p>knowing how to tap into these plasticity mechanisms</p>
<p>is very powerful.</p>
<p>You need these chemicals deployed in the nervous system</p>
<p>in order to mark whatever nerve cells</p>
<p>happen to be firing in the time afterward for change.</p>
<p>And people are obsessed with asking what supplements,</p>
<p>what drugs, what conditions,</p>
<p>what machines will allow for that.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a natural set of conditions that allow for that.</p>
<p>When we came into this world,</p>
<p>we learned to take our different maps of experience,</p>
<p>our motor maps, our auditory maps, our visual maps,</p>
<p>and to link them, we align those maps.</p>
<p>The simplest example is the one I gave before.</p>
<p>If I hear something off to my right,</p>
<p>like a click like that,</p>
<p>it could come from my finger snapping,</p>
<p>or it could come from something generated by somebody else</p>
<p>or something else to my right.</p>
<p>I look to my right.</p>
<p>If I hear it on the left, I look to my left.</p>
<p>If I hear it right in front of me,</p>
<p>I keep looking right in front of me.</p>
<p>And if I hear it behind me, I turn around.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because our maps of visual space</p>
<p>and our maps of auditory space</p>
<p>and our maps of motor space</p>
<p>are aligned to one another in perfect register.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredible feature of our nervous system.</p>
<p>It takes place in a structure called the superior colliculus,</p>
<p>although you don&rsquo;t need to know that name.</p>
<p>Superior colliculus has layers,</p>
<p>literally stacks of neurons, like in a sandwich,</p>
<p>where the zero point right in front of me,</p>
<p>or maybe 10 or 15 degrees off to my right,</p>
<p>or 10 or 15 degrees off to my left,</p>
<p>are aligned so that the auditory neurons,</p>
<p>the ones that care about sounds, at 15 degrees to my right,</p>
<p>sit directly below the neurons</p>
<p>that look at 15 degrees to my right in my visual system.</p>
<p>And when I reach over to this direction,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a signal that&rsquo;s sent down through those layers</p>
<p>that says 15 degrees off to the right</p>
<p>is the direction to look, it&rsquo;s the direction to listen,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the direction to move if I need to move.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an alignment.</p>
<p>And this is really powerful.</p>
<p>And this is what allows us to move through space</p>
<p>and function in our lives in a really fluid way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s set up during development,</p>
<p>but there have been some important experiments</p>
<p>that have revealed that these maps are plastic,</p>
<p>meaning they can shift, they&rsquo;re subject to neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>and there are specific rules that allow us to shift them.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the key experiment.</p>
<p>The key experiment was done by a colleague of mine,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s now retired, but whose work is absolutely fundamental</p>
<p>in the field of neuroplasticity, Eric Knudsen.</p>
<p>The Knudsen Lab,</p>
<p>and many of the Knudsen Lab scientific offspring,</p>
<p>showed that if one is to wear prism glasses</p>
<p>that shift the visual field,</p>
<p>that eventually there&rsquo;ll be a shift</p>
<p>in the representation of the auditory and motor maps too.</p>
<p>Now, what they initially did</p>
<p>is they looked at young subjects.</p>
<p>And what they did is they moved the visual world</p>
<p>by making them wear prism glasses,</p>
<p>so that, for instance, if my pen is out in front of me</p>
<p>at five degrees off-center,</p>
<p>so just a little bit off-center,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re listening to this,</p>
<p>this would be like just a little bit to my right,</p>
<p>but in these prism glasses,</p>
<p>I actually see that pen way over far on my right.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s actually here, but I see it over there</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m wearing prisms on my eyes.</p>
<p>What happens is in the first day or so,</p>
<p>you ask people or you ask animal subjects or whatever</p>
<p>to reach for this object,</p>
<p>and they reach to the wrong place</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re seeing it where it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>This gets especially complicated</p>
<p>when you start including sounds,</p>
<p>when you have a thing off to your right making a sound,</p>
<p>but the thing is actually right here.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re hearing the sound at one location</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re seeing the object at another location</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re wearing these prisms.</p>
<p>So your image of the world is totally distorted.</p>
<p>Or in experiments done by other groups,</p>
<p>they wear glasses, subjects wore glasses</p>
<p>that completely invert the visual world</p>
<p>so that everything is upside down,</p>
<p>which is an extreme example of these representational maps</p>
<p>being flipped or shifted.</p>
<p>But what you find is that in young individuals</p>
<p>within a day or two,</p>
<p>they start adjusting their motor behavior</p>
<p>in exactly the right way</p>
<p>so that they always reach to the correct location.</p>
<p>So they hear a sound at one location,</p>
<p>they see the object that ought to make that sound</p>
<p>at a different location,</p>
<p>and they somehow are able to adjust their motor behavior</p>
<p>to reach to the correct location,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredible, it&rsquo;s absolutely incredible.</p>
<p>Or in the case of the people</p>
<p>who look at the world upside down,</p>
<p>they somehow are able to navigate this upside down world,</p>
<p>even though we&rsquo;re completely used to</p>
<p>our feet being on the floor and not on the ceiling</p>
<p>and people not walking at us</p>
<p>by hanging off the ceiling like bats, amazing.</p>
<p>And what it tells us is that these maps</p>
<p>that are aligned to one another</p>
<p>can move and shift and rotate and even flip themselves.</p>
<p>And it happens best in young individuals.</p>
<p>If you do this in older individuals,</p>
<p>in most cases it takes a very long time</p>
<p>for the maps to shift,</p>
<p>and in some cases they never shift.</p>
<p>So this is a very experimental scenario,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an important one to understand</p>
<p>because it really tamps down the fact</p>
<p>that we have the capacity to create dramatic shifts</p>
<p>in our representation of the outside world.</p>
<p>So how can we get plasticity as adults</p>
<p>that mimics the plasticity that we get</p>
<p>when we are juveniles?</p>
<p>Well, the Knudsen lab and other labs have looked at this,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>First of all, we have to ask,</p>
<p>what is the signal for plasticity?</p>
<p>Is it just having prism glasses on?</p>
<p>No, because they did that experiment and ruled that out.</p>
<p>Is it just the fact that the visual thing</p>
<p>appears to be far over to my right</p>
<p>when in fact it&rsquo;s right in front of me?</p>
<p>No, the signal that generates the plasticity</p>
<p>is the making of errors.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the reaches and failures</p>
<p>that signal to the nervous system</p>
<p>that this is not working,</p>
<p>and therefore the shifts start to take place.</p>
<p>And this is so fundamentally important</p>
<p>because I think most people think,</p>
<p>oh, well, practice is going to be,</p>
<p>I have to access beginner&rsquo;s mind,</p>
<p>which is a great concept actually.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about approaching things, expecting to make errors,</p>
<p>which is great.</p>
<p>I think I am a believer in beginner&rsquo;s mind,</p>
<p>but people understandably get frustrated.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re trying to learn a piece on the piano</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t know, they can&rsquo;t do it,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re trying to write a piece of code,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re trying to access some sort of motor behavior</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>And the frustration drives them crazy</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, I can&rsquo;t do it, I can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>When they don&rsquo;t realize that the errors themselves</p>
<p>are signaling to the brain and nervous system,</p>
<p>something&rsquo;s not working.</p>
<p>And of course the brain doesn&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>the words, something isn&rsquo;t working.</p>
<p>The brain doesn&rsquo;t even understand frustration</p>
<p>as an emotional state.</p>
<p>The brain understands the neurochemicals that are released,</p>
<p>namely epinephrine and acetylcholine,</p>
<p>but also, and we&rsquo;ll get into this, the molecule dopamine,</p>
<p>when we start to approximate the correct behavior</p>
<p>just a little bit,</p>
<p>and we start getting a little bit right.</p>
<p>So what happens is when we make errors,</p>
<p>the nervous system kind of, I don&rsquo;t want to say freaks out</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a very mechanistic and controlled situation,</p>
<p>but the nervous system starts releasing neurotransmitters</p>
<p>and neuromodulators that say,</p>
<p>we better change something in the circuitry.</p>
<p>And so errors are the basis</p>
<p>for neuroplasticity and for learning.</p>
<p>And I wish that this was more prominent out there.</p>
<p>I guess this is why I&rsquo;m saying it.</p>
<p>And humans do not like this feeling of frustration</p>
<p>and making errors.</p>
<p>The few that do, do exceedingly well in whatever pursuits</p>
<p>they happen to be involved in.</p>
<p>The ones that don&rsquo;t generally don&rsquo;t do well.</p>
<p>They generally don&rsquo;t learn much.</p>
<p>And if you think about it,</p>
<p>why would your nervous system ever change?</p>
<p>Why would it ever change?</p>
<p>Unless there was something to be afraid of,</p>
<p>something that made us feel awful,</p>
<p>will signal that the nervous system needs to change,</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s an error in our performance.</p>
<p>So it turns out that the feedback of these errors,</p>
<p>the reaching to the wrong location</p>
<p>starts to release a number of things.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;ve heard about them many times,</p>
<p>but this would be epinephrine.</p>
<p>It increases alertness, acetylcholine focus.</p>
<p>And this is why frustration that leads us</p>
<p>to just kind of quit and walk away from the endeavor</p>
<p>is the absolute worst thing.</p>
<p>But because if acetylcholine is released,</p>
<p>it creates an opportunity to focus on the error margin,</p>
<p>the distance between what it is that you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and what it is that you would like to do.</p>
<p>And then the nervous system starts to make changes</p>
<p>almost immediately in order to try</p>
<p>and get the behavior right.</p>
<p>And when you start getting it even a little bit right,</p>
<p>that third molecule comes online or is released,</p>
<p>which is dopamine,</p>
<p>which allows for the plastic changes to occur very fast.</p>
<p>Now, this is what all happens very naturally</p>
<p>in young brains, but in old brains,</p>
<p>it tends to be pretty slow, except for in two conditions.</p>
<p>So let me just pause and just say this.</p>
<p>If you are uncomfortable making errors</p>
<p>and you get frustrated easily,</p>
<p>if you leverage that frustration</p>
<p>toward drilling deeper into the endeavor,</p>
<p>you are setting yourself up</p>
<p>for a terrific set of plasticity mechanisms to engage.</p>
<p>But if you take that frustration</p>
<p>and you walk away from the endeavor,</p>
<p>you are essentially setting up plasticity</p>
<p>to rewire you according to what happens afterwards,</p>
<p>which is generally feeling pretty miserable.</p>
<p>So now you can kind of start to appreciate why it is</p>
<p>that continuing to drill into a process</p>
<p>to the point of frustration,</p>
<p>but then staying with that process for a little bit longer,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll define exactly what I mean by a little bit,</p>
<p>is the most important thing for adult learning,</p>
<p>as well as childhood learning,</p>
<p>but adult learning in particular.</p>
<p>Now, the Newton Lab did two very important</p>
<p>sets of experiments.</p>
<p>The first one was published in Nature,</p>
<p>very important study,</p>
<p>which showed that juveniles can make these massive shifts</p>
<p>in their map representations,</p>
<p>meaning you can shift the visual world</p>
<p>using visual prisms a huge amount,</p>
<p>and very quickly, young individuals</p>
<p>can shift their representations of the world</p>
<p>so that they learn to reach to the correct location.</p>
<p>They get a lot of plasticity all at once.</p>
<p>It happens very fast in the period of just a couple days.</p>
<p>In adults, it tends to be very slow,</p>
<p>and most individuals never actually accomplish</p>
<p>the full map shift.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t get the plasticity.</p>
<p>Here, we&rsquo;re talking about map shifts,</p>
<p>but this could be learning a new language.</p>
<p>This could be any number of different things</p>
<p>that one were attempting.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re saying is what I already said before,</p>
<p>which is that we learn very well as youngsters,</p>
<p>but not as adults after 25.</p>
<p>But then what they did is they started</p>
<p>making the increment of change smaller.</p>
<p>So instead of shifting the world a huge amount</p>
<p>by putting prisms that shifted the visual world</p>
<p>all the way over to the right,</p>
<p>they did this incrementally.</p>
<p>So first they put on prisms that shifted it</p>
<p>just a little bit, just like seven degrees,</p>
<p>I believe was the exact number,</p>
<p>and then it was 14 degrees, and then it was 28 degrees.</p>
<p>And so what they found was that the adult nervous system</p>
<p>can tolerate smaller and smaller errors over time,</p>
<p>but that you can stack those errors</p>
<p>so that you can get a lot of plasticity.</p>
<p>Put simply, incremental learning as an adult</p>
<p>is absolutely essential.</p>
<p>You are not going to get massive shifts</p>
<p>in your representations of the outside world.</p>
<p>So how do you make small errors as opposed to big errors?</p>
<p>Well, the key is smaller bouts of focused learning</p>
<p>for smaller bits of information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mistake to try and learn a lot of information</p>
<p>in one learning bout as an adult.</p>
<p>What these papers from the Knudsen Lab show,</p>
<p>and what others have gone on to show,</p>
<p>is that the adult nervous system is fully capable</p>
<p>of engaging in a huge amount of plasticity,</p>
<p>but you need to do it in smaller increments</p>
<p>per learning epoch or per learning episode.</p>
<p>So how would you do this?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s say, for instance, I&rsquo;m terrible at free throws.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say I wanted to learn free throws.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 45 years old, so I&rsquo;m well past the 25 and under mark.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to make errors, I&rsquo;m going to make a lot of errors.</p>
<p>If I go into learning free throws</p>
<p>knowing that errors are the gate to plasticity,</p>
<p>well, then I feel a little bit better,</p>
<p>but I still have to aim for the rim of the basket</p>
<p>or the net, basically showing</p>
<p>how little I know about basketball.</p>
<p>But I think I know the general themes around basketball.</p>
<p>It involves a net, a backboard, and a ball, of course.</p>
<p>So I go to the free throw line and I&rsquo;ll throw.</p>
<p>How long should I go?</p>
<p>Well, until I&rsquo;m hitting the point of frustration.</p>
<p>And at that point, continuing probably</p>
<p>for anywhere from 10 to 100 more trials</p>
<p>should be my limit, right?</p>
<p>That should be my limit if I want to improve</p>
<p>some specific aspect of the motor behavior.</p>
<p>And so the question then is,</p>
<p>what should I be paying attention to?</p>
<p>What should I be focusing on?</p>
<p>Well, obviously trying to get the ball into the basket.</p>
<p>But the beauty of motor learning is that the circuits</p>
<p>for auditory and visual and motor</p>
<p>more or less teach themselves.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily have to be paying attention</p>
<p>to exactly what the contact of my fingers with the ball</p>
<p>or some random feature,</p>
<p>like whether or not I&rsquo;m bending my knees or not.</p>
<p>The key is to try a number of different parameters</p>
<p>until I start to approximate the behavior</p>
<p>that I want to get a little bit better,</p>
<p>and then trying to get consistent about that.</p>
<p>Now, many of you involved in sports learning will say,</p>
<p>okay, well, that&rsquo;s obvious, it&rsquo;s just incremental learning.</p>
<p>But the key thing is in those errors.</p>
<p>By isolating the errors and making a number of errors</p>
<p>in a particular aspect of the motor movement,</p>
<p>it signals to the brain that it&rsquo;s plastic.</p>
<p>And if I leave that episode of going</p>
<p>and trying to learn how to shoot free throws,</p>
<p>my brain is still plastic.</p>
<p>Plasticity is a state of the brain and nervous system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just geared toward the specific thing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to learn.</p>
<p>So there are two aspects to plasticity</p>
<p>that I think we really need to highlight.</p>
<p>One is that there&rsquo;s plasticity geared toward the thing</p>
<p>that you are trying to learn specifically.</p>
<p>And then there are states of mind and body</p>
<p>that allow us to access plasticity.</p>
<p>Now, toward the end of this episode,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to spell out specific protocols</p>
<p>in a little more detail.</p>
<p>That free throw example might not correlate</p>
<p>with what you want to learn.</p>
<p>Actually, I don&rsquo;t have a huge desire to learn free throws.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve more or less given up on basketball,</p>
<p>but, and free throws in particular.</p>
<p>But I think that it&rsquo;s important to understand</p>
<p>that motor movements are the most straightforward way</p>
<p>to access states of plasticity.</p>
<p>And that can be for sake of learning the motor movement</p>
<p>or for sake of accessing plasticity more generally.</p>
<p>One very important aspect to plasticity,</p>
<p>getting plasticity as an adult</p>
<p>is not just smaller increments, meaning shorter bouts.</p>
<p>So I gave an example of, you know,</p>
<p>another hundred free throws or something,</p>
<p>but going out there and just getting my 10,000 free throws</p>
<p>all at once or packing as much as I can into one episode</p>
<p>is not going to be as efficient for me</p>
<p>as shorter bouts of intense learning as an adult,</p>
<p>because the error signals are not as well defined.</p>
<p>To my nervous system,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to know what needs to change.</p>
<p>And so this is really the key element</p>
<p>of incremental learning,</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re trying to signal to the nervous system</p>
<p>at least one component that needs to change.</p>
<p>The nervous system needs to know what the error is.</p>
<p>Now, when I shoot free throws,</p>
<p>Lord knows there are a lot of different kinds of errors</p>
<p>that happen, probably the way I&rsquo;m bending my knees,</p>
<p>the arc of the ball, the way I&rsquo;m organizing my shoulders,</p>
<p>probably where my eyes are, lots of things.</p>
<p>So which ones to focus on?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I said before,</p>
<p>the beauty of the motor system is</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to worry about all of that.</p>
<p>I just need to get the reps in a number of times</p>
<p>and the nervous system will figure out</p>
<p>how far off my motor commands are</p>
<p>at the level of these maps that I described earlier,</p>
<p>how far those are, those deviate from the desired behavior,</p>
<p>getting the ball into the basket,</p>
<p>and it will start making adjustments.</p>
<p>But as I make adjustments,</p>
<p>or as my nervous system makes adjustments for me,</p>
<p>the key thing is to not start adding a variety of new errors</p>
<p>because then it gets confused.</p>
<p>And so this is why short learning bouts</p>
<p>are absolutely essential.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s for learning an instrument as an adult,</p>
<p>probably anywhere from seven minutes to 30 minutes</p>
<p>is going to, provided that it&rsquo;s full,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fully attending, you&rsquo;re very focused,</p>
<p>is going to be a pretty significant stimulus</p>
<p>to inspire plasticity in the nervous system.</p>
<p>Now, there is one way to get a lot of plasticity</p>
<p>all at once as an adult.</p>
<p>There is that kind of holy grail thing</p>
<p>of getting massive plasticity as you would</p>
<p>when you were a young person, but as an adult.</p>
<p>And the Knudsen lab revealed this</p>
<p>by setting a very serious contingency on the learning.</p>
<p>What they did was they had a situation</p>
<p>where subjects had to find food</p>
<p>that was displaced in their visual world,</p>
<p>again, by putting prisms, and they had to find the food,</p>
<p>and the food made a noise.</p>
<p>There was a noise set kind of the location of the food</p>
<p>through an array of speakers.</p>
<p>Basically, what they found was that</p>
<p>if people have to adjust their visual world</p>
<p>in order to get food,</p>
<p>the plasticity would eventually occur,</p>
<p>but it was very slow as an adult.</p>
<p>It was very, very slow.</p>
<p>Unless they actually had to hunt that food.</p>
<p>They actually, if they, in order to eat at all,</p>
<p>they needed plasticity.</p>
<p>And then what happened was remarkable.</p>
<p>What they observed is that the plasticity as an adult</p>
<p>can be as dramatic, as robust as it is in a young person,</p>
<p>or in a young animal subject,</p>
<p>provided that there&rsquo;s a serious incentive</p>
<p>for the plasticity to occur.</p>
<p>And this is absolutely important to understand,</p>
<p>which is that how badly we need or want the plasticity</p>
<p>determines how fast that plasticity will arrive,</p>
<p>which is incredible because the brain is just neurons</p>
<p>and soup of chemicals.</p>
<p>So what this, but this means that the importance</p>
<p>of something, how important something is to us</p>
<p>actually gates the rate of plasticity</p>
<p>and the magnitude of plasticity.</p>
<p>And this is why just passively going through most things,</p>
<p>going through the motions, as we say,</p>
<p>or just getting our reps in, quote unquote,</p>
<p>is not sufficient to get the nervous system to change.</p>
<p>This study, a beautiful study published</p>
<p>in the Journal of Neuroscience shows that</p>
<p>if we actually have to accomplish something</p>
<p>in order to eat or in order to get our ration of income,</p>
<p>we will reshape our nervous system very, very quickly.</p>
<p>So the nervous system has a capacity, excuse me,</p>
<p>to change at a tremendous rate to an enormous degree</p>
<p>at any stage of life,</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s important enough that that happened.</p>
<p>And I think some of you might be saying,</p>
<p>well, duh, that&rsquo;s obvious.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s really crucial,</p>
<p>then of course it&rsquo;s going to change faster,</p>
<p>but it didn&rsquo;t have to be that way.</p>
<p>And for most people who are trying to learn</p>
<p>how to learn faster or learn better,</p>
<p>they probably, in most cases,</p>
<p>they are hitting a limit</p>
<p>because the need to change is not crucial enough.</p>
<p>And I think there are a number of places</p>
<p>where this has important relevance in the, you know,</p>
<p>people who are battling addiction, for instance.</p>
<p>I will be the first to say that, you know,</p>
<p>I sympathize with the fact</p>
<p>that addictions have a biological component.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s clearly cases where people struggle tremendously</p>
<p>to change their behavior and their nervous system,</p>
<p>in some cases, is so disrupted</p>
<p>by whatever substance they&rsquo;ve been abusing</p>
<p>or behavior that they&rsquo;ve been engaging in</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s that much harder for them to change.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve also seen incredible examples</p>
<p>where when people have to change from an internal standpoint,</p>
<p>from their own belief and desire to change,</p>
<p>that massive change is possible.</p>
<p>And so I think that the studies that Knudsen did</p>
<p>showing that incremental learning</p>
<p>can create a huge degree of plasticity as an adult,</p>
<p>as well as when the contingency is very high,</p>
<p>meaning we need to eat or we need to make an income,</p>
<p>or we need to do something that&rsquo;s vitally important for us,</p>
<p>that plasticity can happen in these enormous leaps,</p>
<p>just like they can in adolescence and young adulthood.</p>
<p>That points to the fact</p>
<p>that it has to be a neurochemical system.</p>
<p>There has to be an underlying mechanism, right?</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t a case of sticking a wire into the brain</p>
<p>or taking a particular drug.</p>
<p>All the chemicals that we&rsquo;re about to talk about</p>
<p>are released from drug stores, if you will,</p>
<p>chemical stores that already reside in all of our brains.</p>
<p>And the key is how to tap into those stores.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re going to next talk about</p>
<p>what are the specific behaviors</p>
<p>that liberate particular categories of chemicals</p>
<p>that allow us to make the most of incremental learning</p>
<p>and that set the stage for plasticity</p>
<p>that is similar enough or mimics</p>
<p>these high-contingency states,</p>
<p>like the need to get food</p>
<p>or really create a sense of internal urgency,</p>
<p>chemical urgency, if you will.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve heard previous episodes of this podcast,</p>
<p>you may have heard me talk about ultradian rhythms,</p>
<p>which are these 90-minute rhythms</p>
<p>that break up our 24-hour day.</p>
<p>They help break up our sleep</p>
<p>into different cycles of sleep,</p>
<p>like REM sleep and non-REM sleep.</p>
<p>And in waking states, they help us,</p>
<p>or I should say they break up our day</p>
<p>in ways that allow us to learn best</p>
<p>within 90-minute cycles, et cetera.</p>
<p>So some of you might be saying,</p>
<p>wait, you&rsquo;ve been talking about ultradian cycles,</p>
<p>and a moment ago you were talking about</p>
<p>seven-minute or 12-minute or 30-minute learning cycles.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re really talking about</p>
<p>how to tap into plasticity</p>
<p>through the completion of a task</p>
<p>or working towards something repetitively and making errors.</p>
<p>And so just to frame this</p>
<p>in the context of the ultradian cycle,</p>
<p>you might sit down,</p>
<p>decide that you&rsquo;re going to learn conversational French,</p>
<p>which would mean that you probably</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t already speak French.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to sit down,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to decide you&rsquo;re going to learn</p>
<p>some nouns and some verbs.</p>
<p>You might do some practice sets.</p>
<p>The ultradian cycle says that for the first</p>
<p>five to 10 minutes of doing that,</p>
<p>your mind is going to drift</p>
<p>and your focus will probably kick in</p>
<p>provided that you&rsquo;re visually,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re restricting your visual world</p>
<p>to just the material in front of you,</p>
<p>something we talked about last episode,</p>
<p>somewhere around the 10 or 15-minute mark.</p>
<p>And then at best,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably going to get about an hour</p>
<p>of deliberate kind of tunnel vision learning in there.</p>
<p>Your mind will drift.</p>
<p>And then toward the end of that,</p>
<p>what is now an hour and 10 or hour and 20-minute cycle,</p>
<p>your brain will start to flicker in and out.</p>
<p>You might start thinking about what you need to eat</p>
<p>or the fact that you have to use the bathroom or something.</p>
<p>And then by the 90 minutes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably time to just stop the learning bout</p>
<p>and go do something else.</p>
<p>Maybe return for a second learning bout later,</p>
<p>but maybe take a nap afterwards</p>
<p>or something to enhance the learning,</p>
<p>but that it&rsquo;s going to happen within</p>
<p>about a 90-minute block,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to go through that cycle of learning.</p>
<p>But when I refer to the seven or 12 or 30 minutes</p>
<p>of making errors,</p>
<p>what I mean is when you&rsquo;re really in a mode</p>
<p>of repeating errors, not deliberately,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying your best to accomplish something</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re failing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely failing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to remember, say, the sign language alphabet.</p>
<p>I was trying to teach myself this recently,</p>
<p>and then I kept repeating and repeating.</p>
<p>And then to get to a certain point where I kept</p>
<p>making errors, making errors, making errors.</p>
<p>You want to keep making errors for this period of time</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m saying will last anywhere</p>
<p>for about seven to 30 minutes.</p>
<p>It is exceedingly frustrating,</p>
<p>but that frustration, it liberates the chemical cues</p>
<p>that signal that plasticity needs to happen.</p>
<p>And they also signal the particular neurons that are active.</p>
<p>So in the case of sign language,</p>
<p>it might be the ones that control my hand movements</p>
<p>as well as me thinking about what the different letters are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s signaling different components within the networks</p>
<p>between the brain and body.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s trying to figure out, wait,</p>
<p>where are these errors coming from?</p>
<p>Where are the errors coming from?</p>
<p>Ah, it&rsquo;s those neurons.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re making the mistakes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re making the mistakes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re making the mistakes.</p>
<p>And it essentially highlights that pathway for change.</p>
<p>And it is the case that when we come back a day or two later</p>
<p>in a learning bout after a nap or a night or two</p>
<p>of deep rest, then what we find is that we can remember</p>
<p>certain things and the motor pathways work.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t always get it perfectly,</p>
<p>but we get a lot of it right,</p>
<p>whereas we got it wrong before.</p>
<p>So that seven to 30 minute intense learning bout</p>
<p>is within the ultradian cycle.</p>
<p>And I want to be clear about that.</p>
<p>And some people can tolerate many of these per day.</p>
<p>Most people can only tolerate one or two, maybe three.</p>
<p>This is intense work.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m shooting free throws,</p>
<p>you could probably do it all day.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m talking about is really trying</p>
<p>to accelerate plasticity by having a period</p>
<p>of the seven to 30 minutes per learning bout</p>
<p>that is specifically about making errors.</p>
<p>I want to really underscore that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not about, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>coming up with some little hack or trick</p>
<p>or something of that sort.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really about trying to cue the nervous system</p>
<p>that something needs to change</p>
<p>because otherwise it simply won&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s another aspect to learning.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s only fair to mention,</p>
<p>which is that we can all learn very easily</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s something very bad happens to us.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t wish this on anyone,</p>
<p>but it is the case that if something really terrible happens</p>
<p>that we will have a lifetime memory for that event.</p>
<p>There are processes that allow us</p>
<p>to uncouple the emotional load of that event.</p>
<p>I talked about some of those a few episodes back,</p>
<p>the episode on dreams, trauma, and hallucinations.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to return to trauma release, PTSD,</p>
<p>and some of those other themes in a future episode.</p>
<p>But the reason why negative experiences</p>
<p>can be wired into us so quickly</p>
<p>is because our nervous system&rsquo;s main job is to keep us safe.</p>
<p>But at a deeper level,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because negative experiences cue us to the fact</p>
<p>that whatever&rsquo;s happening that&rsquo;s really bad</p>
<p>is very different than the other things</p>
<p>that tend to happen before.</p>
<p>So most of our experience doesn&rsquo;t remap us,</p>
<p>but those negative experiences</p>
<p>deploy high levels of norepinephrine,</p>
<p>high levels of acetylcholine,</p>
<p>and really make so that whatever it is that we experience</p>
<p>in that bad episode is essentially cued up.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re on the lookout for it.</p>
<p>And this has a number of negative effects,</p>
<p>but in terms of psychological and emotional effects,</p>
<p>but it is really a process designed to keep us safe.</p>
<p>The other ways in which we can learn more quickly</p>
<p>besides just making errors</p>
<p>is when something really surprises us.</p>
<p>And if we&rsquo;re positively surprised by something</p>
<p>or we are just flooded with this molecule dopamine,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s a great opportunity for plasticity.</p>
<p>Dopamine is a molecule</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s almost always associated with pleasure</p>
<p>and with the accomplishment of a particular goal,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really also a molecule of motivation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a molecule that is released inside of us</p>
<p>when we think we&rsquo;re on the right path.</p>
<p>And it does have a capacity</p>
<p>to increase neuroplasticity, motivation, et cetera.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s released in response to a number of natural behaviors</p>
<p>just that help with the progression of ours</p>
<p>and other species, things like food, sex,</p>
<p>in some sense, social connection,</p>
<p>although that&rsquo;s more serotonin,</p>
<p>and serotonin doesn&rsquo;t have the same effects on plasticity,</p>
<p>quite the same, and we&rsquo;ll talk about a few later.</p>
<p>But dopamine is when we think we&rsquo;re on the right path</p>
<p>toward an external goal, a little bit is released</p>
<p>and it tends to give us more motivation toward that goal.</p>
<p>I think everyone could stand to enhance the rate of learning</p>
<p>by doing the following.</p>
<p>Learn to attach dopamine in a subjective way</p>
<p>to this process of making errors,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s really combining two modes of plasticity</p>
<p>in ways that together can accelerate the plasticity.</p>
<p>So earlier I talked about making errors</p>
<p>and having a focus bout of learning</p>
<p>that includes making a lot of errors</p>
<p>inside of that learning bout.</p>
<p>That is going to be frustrating,</p>
<p>but the frustration itself is the cue,</p>
<p>and epinephrine will be very high under those conditions.</p>
<p>But if you can just subjectively associate that experience</p>
<p>with something good and that you want to continue</p>
<p>down that path as opposed to quitting</p>
<p>when you hit the point of frustration,</p>
<p>well, then you now start to create a synergy</p>
<p>between the dopamine that&rsquo;s released</p>
<p>when we subjectively think something is good</p>
<p>or tell ourselves something is good</p>
<p>and that situation of making failures.</p>
<p>In other words, failing repetitively,</p>
<p>provided we&rsquo;re engaged in a very specific set of behaviors</p>
<p>when we do it, as well as telling ourselves</p>
<p>that those failures are good for learning and good for us,</p>
<p>creates an outsized effect on the rate of plasticity.</p>
<p>It accelerates plasticity.</p>
<p>Now, some of you might be asking, and I get asked a lot,</p>
<p>well, how do I get dopamine to be released?</p>
<p>And can I just tell myself</p>
<p>that something is good when it&rsquo;s bad?</p>
<p>Well, actually, yes, believe it or not.</p>
<p>The thing about dopamine is it&rsquo;s highly subjective.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s funny to one person</p>
<p>is not necessarily funny to the next.</p>
<p>So it has to have some sense of authenticity for you.</p>
<p>But if you really want to be learning the thing</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to learn,</p>
<p>that should be reason enough to tell yourself,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m frustrated, but the frustration</p>
<p>is the source of accelerated learning.</p>
<p>Dopamine is one of these incredible molecules</p>
<p>that both can be released according to things</p>
<p>that are hardwired in us to release dopamine.</p>
<p>Again, things like food, sex, warmth when we&rsquo;re cold,</p>
<p>cool environments when we&rsquo;re too warm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that kind of pleasure molecule overall,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also highly subjective</p>
<p>what releases dopamine in one person versus the next.</p>
<p>So everyone releases dopamine in response</p>
<p>to those very basic kind of behaviors and activities,</p>
<p>but dopamine is also released</p>
<p>according to what we subjectively believe is good for us.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so powerful about it.</p>
<p>In fact, a book that I highly recommend</p>
<p>if you want to read more about dopamine,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a book that frankly, I wish I had written.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a wonderful book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called The Molecule of More.</p>
<p>And it really talks about dopamine,</p>
<p>not just as a molecule associated with reward,</p>
<p>but a molecule associated with motivation and pursuit</p>
<p>and just how subjectively controlled dopamine can be.</p>
<p>So make lots of errors.</p>
<p>Tell yourself that those errors are important</p>
<p>and good for your overall learning goals.</p>
<p>So learn to attach dopamine,</p>
<p>meaning release dopamine in your brain</p>
<p>when you start to make errors.</p>
<p>Keep the bouts of learning relatively short</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re an adult.</p>
<p>Younger people can probably engage</p>
<p>in more bouts of learning.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably one of the reasons</p>
<p>why they learn so much faster.</p>
<p>They can just pack so much more information</p>
<p>into their brains and nervous systems compared to adults.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a little bit like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll use the example of performance enhancing drugs.</p>
<p>Some of those drugs probably do enhance performance</p>
<p>at the level of increasing red blood cell count, et cetera.</p>
<p>But a lot of what those drugs do</p>
<p>is they allow athletes to recover faster</p>
<p>so they can just train more.</p>
<p>They allow them to do more work.</p>
<p>And so being a child is a little bit</p>
<p>like being in a performance enhanced brain milieu.</p>
<p>Their brains are kind of on natural, healthy neurochemicals</p>
<p>that afford them a lot more learning should they pursue it.</p>
<p>So this goes back to my advice for young people early on.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re young, what should you do?</p>
<p>Learn as much as you can about as many things</p>
<p>as you possibly can.</p>
<p>And I suggest specializing in something.</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;m not in a position to give anyone direct advice,</p>
<p>but I would say hopefully by about age 30, hopefully younger</p>
<p>you have some sense of what excites you</p>
<p>and try and get really good at that thing</p>
<p>provided it serves the world for better.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ll say in terms of parenting advice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not my place.</p>
<p>But maybe sometime I&rsquo;ll have an episode</p>
<p>completely devoted to sort of youth and learning in youth.</p>
<p>But once you&rsquo;re attaching dopamine</p>
<p>to this process of making errors,</p>
<p>then I start getting lots of questions</p>
<p>that really are the right questions,</p>
<p>which are how often should I do this?</p>
<p>And when should I be doing this?</p>
<p>And at what time?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve talked a little bit about this</p>
<p>in previous episodes, but as long as we&rsquo;re now</p>
<p>kind of into the nitty gritty of tools and application,</p>
<p>each of us have some natural times throughout the day</p>
<p>when we are going to be much better</p>
<p>at tolerating these errors and much more focused</p>
<p>on what it is that we&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>Last episode was about focus,</p>
<p>but chances are that you can&rsquo;t focus as well</p>
<p>at 4 p.m. as you can at 10 a.m.</p>
<p>It differs for everybody depending on when you&rsquo;re sleeping</p>
<p>and your kind of natural chemistry and rhythms,</p>
<p>but find the time or times of day</p>
<p>when you naturally have the highest mental acuity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really when you want to engage</p>
<p>in these learning bouts.</p>
<p>And then get to the point where you&rsquo;re making errors</p>
<p>and then keep making errors for seven to 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Just keep making those errors and drill through it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re almost seeking frustration.</p>
<p>And if you can find some pleasure in the frustration,</p>
<p>yes, that is a state that exists.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve created the optimal neurochemical milieu</p>
<p>for learning that thing.</p>
<p>But then here&rsquo;s the beauty of it.</p>
<p>You also have created the optimal milieu</p>
<p>for learning other things afterward.</p>
<p>If you leave that bout of,</p>
<p>I gave the example of free throws,</p>
<p>or maybe it&rsquo;s playing tennis,</p>
<p>or maybe it&rsquo;s some other skill,</p>
<p>and you sit down to read a book,</p>
<p>your brain is in a heightened state</p>
<p>to learn and retain the information.</p>
<p>Because those chemicals don&rsquo;t get released</p>
<p>and then shut down.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re creating a whole milieu</p>
<p>and environment of these chemicals.</p>
<p>And the tale of how long these chemicals stay,</p>
<p>you know, sloshing around in your brain</p>
<p>has too many factors for me to put a hard number on it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to depend on transporters and enzymes</p>
<p>and all sorts of things.</p>
<p>But at least for an hour or so, I would say,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be in a state of heightened learning</p>
<p>and the ability to learn not just the motor patterns,</p>
<p>but cognitive information, language information.</p>
<p>Maybe you go to therapy right after that</p>
<p>and you work on something in a very deliberate way</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to work on.</p>
<p>Maybe you don&rsquo;t go to therapy.</p>
<p>Maybe you do something else that&rsquo;s important to you.</p>
<p>Again, there are just a variety of examples I could give.</p>
<p>There are a number of things that allow us</p>
<p>to powerfully access these states of error</p>
<p>that are kind of surprising, but also kind of fun.</p>
<p>And these aren&rsquo;t, again, these aren&rsquo;t gimmicks.</p>
<p>These tap into these basic mechanisms of plasticity.</p>
<p>And the three that I&rsquo;d like to talk about next</p>
<p>are balance, meaning the vestibular system,</p>
<p>as well as the two sides of what I call limbic friction</p>
<p>or autonomic arousal.</p>
<p>And if none of that makes sense,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to put a fine point on each one of those</p>
<p>and what it is and why it works</p>
<p>for opening up neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about limbic friction.</p>
<p>Now, limbic friction is not a term</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to find in the textbooks.</p>
<p>So if any of my colleagues are listening,</p>
<p>I want to repeat, limbic friction,</p>
<p>I realize is not something you&rsquo;re going to find</p>
<p>in any of the textbooks.</p>
<p>But it is an important principle</p>
<p>that captures a lot of information that is in textbooks,</p>
<p>both neurobiology and psychology,</p>
<p>and it has some really important implications.</p>
<p>Limbic friction is my attempt to give a name to something</p>
<p>that is more nuanced and mechanistic than stress.</p>
<p>Because typically when we hear about stress,</p>
<p>we think of heart rate, heartbeat, going too fast,</p>
<p>breathing too fast, sweating,</p>
<p>and not being in a state that we want.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re too alert and we want to be more calm.</p>
<p>And indeed, that&rsquo;s one condition</p>
<p>in which we have limbic friction,</p>
<p>meaning our limbic system is taking control</p>
<p>of a number of different aspects of our autonomic</p>
<p>or automatic biology.</p>
<p>And we are struggling to control that</p>
<p>through what we call top-down mechanisms.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to calm down</p>
<p>in order to reduce that level of arousal.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all familiar with this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the stress response.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s another aspect of stress</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just as important, which is when we&rsquo;re tired</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re fatigued and we need to engage,</p>
<p>we need to be more alert than we are.</p>
<p>And so what I call limbic friction</p>
<p>is really designed to describe the fact</p>
<p>that when our autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t where we want it,</p>
<p>meaning we&rsquo;re trying to be more alert</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re trying to be less alert,</p>
<p>both of those feel stressful to people.</p>
<p>So the other way to put it is that the word stress</p>
<p>is not a very good word to describe</p>
<p>what most people experience as stressful</p>
<p>because it can either be being too tired</p>
<p>or being too alert.</p>
<p>Now, why am I bringing this up</p>
<p>in the discussion about neuroplasticity?</p>
<p>This is not a discussion about stress.</p>
<p>At some point, we will talk about stress</p>
<p>and tools to deal with stress.</p>
<p>But the reason I&rsquo;m bringing this up</p>
<p>is that in order to access neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>you need these components of focus.</p>
<p>You need the component of attaching subjective reward.</p>
<p>You need to make errors, all this stuff.</p>
<p>And a lot of people find it difficult</p>
<p>to just get into the overall state to access those things.</p>
<p>So now there&rsquo;s a series of gates</p>
<p>that people are having a hard time accessing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re too tired and they can&rsquo;t focus, for instance.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s the beauty of it.</p>
<p>If you are too alert, meaning you&rsquo;re too anxious</p>
<p>and you want to calm down in order to learn better,</p>
<p>there are things that you can do.</p>
<p>The two that I&rsquo;ve spoken about previously</p>
<p>on various podcasts,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll just review them really quickly,</p>
<p>are the double inhale, exhale.</p>
<p>So inhaling twice through the nose</p>
<p>and exhaling once through the mouth.</p>
<p>This is not some yogic trick or some hack.</p>
<p>This is what&rsquo;s called a physiological sigh.</p>
<p>It offloads carbon dioxide from the lungs.</p>
<p>It has a number of different effects.</p>
<p>These were described in textbooks</p>
<p>and dating back to the 30s.</p>
<p>And a number of laboratories have explored</p>
<p>the neural circuitry underlying</p>
<p>these so-called physiological sighs.</p>
<p>That will calm you down faster</p>
<p>than anything else that I&rsquo;m aware of.</p>
<p>The other thing is starting to remove your tunnel vision.</p>
<p>When you use tunnel vision,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re very focused,</p>
<p>and that epinephrine is released</p>
<p>by dilating your field of gaze,</p>
<p>so-called panoramic vision.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>So now you can start to sort of move up and down</p>
<p>this level of autonomic arousal.</p>
<p>The key is you want to be in a state of arousal</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ideally matched to the thing</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to perform or learn.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m really anxious</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t even pick up the basketball,</p>
<p>or I feel like I&rsquo;m shaking,</p>
<p>or my muscles are too tight,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have that kind of looseness.</p>
<p>Now, when I move like that,</p>
<p>it almost makes it look like I could throw a free throw,</p>
<p>but I miss 95% of the time,</p>
<p>unless the basket is very, very low</p>
<p>and I place it indirectly,</p>
<p>but I guess that&rsquo;s not a free throw, is it?</p>
<p>In any case, the point being</p>
<p>that you want to be in a state of alertness, but calm.</p>
<p>And so you need to have ways to calm yourself down</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re too amped up.</p>
<p>But the other side of limbic friction is important too.</p>
<p>If you are too tired and you can&rsquo;t focus,</p>
<p>well, then it&rsquo;s going to be impossible</p>
<p>to even get to the starting line, so to speak,</p>
<p>for engaging in neuroplasticity</p>
<p>through incremental learning, et cetera.</p>
<p>So in that case, there are other methods</p>
<p>that you can do to wake yourself up.</p>
<p>The best thing you should do is get a good night&rsquo;s sleep,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not always possible,</p>
<p>or use an NSDR, non-sleep deep rest protocol.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;ve already done those things,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re simply exhausted for whatever other reason,</p>
<p>then there are other things that I often get asked about,</p>
<p>like sure, a cup of coffee or super oxygenation breathing,</p>
<p>which means inhaling more than exhaling on average</p>
<p>in a breathing bout.</p>
<p>These are, now we&rsquo;re sort of getting toward the realm</p>
<p>of like how you could trick your nervous system</p>
<p>into waking up.</p>
<p>And if you bring more oxygen in</p>
<p>by making your inhales deeper and longer,</p>
<p>you will become more alert.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll start to actually deploy norepinephrine</p>
<p>if you breathe very fast.</p>
<p>So there are things that you can do to move up or down</p>
<p>this so-called autonomic arousal arc.</p>
<p>And what you want to ask</p>
<p>before you undergo any learning bout</p>
<p>is how much limbic friction am I experiencing?</p>
<p>Am I too alert and I want to be calmer</p>
<p>or am I too calm and too sleepy</p>
<p>and I want to be more alert?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to need to engage in behaviors</p>
<p>that bring you to the starting line in order to learn.</p>
<p>There are other things that you can do</p>
<p>in order to then learn better and faster</p>
<p>besides incremental learning</p>
<p>and those center on the vestibular system.</p>
<p>And this may come as a surprise to some people,</p>
<p>but probably not as a surprise to some of you</p>
<p>whose professions or whose recreation</p>
<p>involves a lot of motor activity</p>
<p>and sort of what we call high dimensional skill activity,</p>
<p>not just running or cycling</p>
<p>or very linear activities like weightlifting,</p>
<p>but things that involve inversions</p>
<p>and a lot of lateral movement, actual sports,</p>
<p>jumping, diving, rolling, these kinds of things,</p>
<p>gymnastics type stuff.</p>
<p>Why the vestibular system to access neuroplasticity?</p>
<p>Well, we have a hardwired system for balance</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s how it works in as simple terms</p>
<p>as I can possibly come up with.</p>
<p>As we move through space or even if we&rsquo;re stationary,</p>
<p>there are really three main planes of movement.</p>
<p>Now I realize some people are just listening to this,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m going to do this for both the folks</p>
<p>that are just listening</p>
<p>and for those of you that are watching on video.</p>
<p>So there are three main modes of movement</p>
<p>and it turns out that your brain</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really know where your body is</p>
<p>except through that proprioceptive feedback.</p>
<p>The main way it knows is through three planes of movement</p>
<p>that we call pitch, which is like nodding.</p>
<p>So if I nod like this, that&rsquo;s pitch.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s yaw, which is side to side,</p>
<p>which is like shaking my head no.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s roll from side to side,</p>
<p>like when a puppy looks at you like that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Okay, so pitch, yaw and roll.</p>
<p>And the pilots out there</p>
<p>will know exactly what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>The brain knows the orientation and position of your body</p>
<p>relative to gravity,</p>
<p>depending on whether or not your brain is,</p>
<p>and your head actually is engaging more in pitch,</p>
<p>yaw or roll or some combination.</p>
<p>Because if I lean down like so, or like so,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a combination of pitch, yaw and roll.</p>
<p>Oh, you might say like, what is going on here?</p>
<p>Well, we have these little things in our inner ear</p>
<p>called the semicircular canals.</p>
<p>Just like our eyes have two main functions.</p>
<p>One is to see objects in space,</p>
<p>and the other is to set our circadian clocks</p>
<p>through subconscious mechanisms.</p>
<p>Our ears have two main roles.</p>
<p>One is to hear, right?</p>
<p>To perceive sound waves,</p>
<p>or take in sound waves for perception, so-called hearing.</p>
<p>And the other is balance or vestibular function.</p>
<p>So sitting in our ears are the semicircular canals.</p>
<p>And there are these little tubes</p>
<p>where these little stones,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re actually little bits of calcium,</p>
<p>roll back and forth like little marbles.</p>
<p>When we roll this way, they roll this way.</p>
<p>When we pitch, when we go from side to side,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some that sit flat like this,</p>
<p>and they go like marbles inside of a hula hoop.</p>
<p>And then we have roll.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some that are kind of at 45 degrees to those,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of pitch, yaw and roll.</p>
<p>So you go, okay, great.</p>
<p>That sends signals to the rest of our brain and body</p>
<p>that tell us how to compensate</p>
<p>for shifts relative to gravity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying, okay,</p>
<p>I thought we were talking about plasticity,</p>
<p>but this is where it gets really, really cool.</p>
<p>Errors in vestibular motor sensory experience,</p>
<p>meaning when we are off balance</p>
<p>and we have to compensate by looking at,</p>
<p>thinking about, or responding to the world differently,</p>
<p>cause an area of our brain called the cerebellum.</p>
<p>It actually means mini brain.</p>
<p>It looks like a little mini brain</p>
<p>like tucked below our cortex in the back.</p>
<p>Cause the cerebellum to signal</p>
<p>some of these deeper brain centers</p>
<p>that release dopamine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because these circuits in the inner ear, et cetera</p>
<p>and the cerebellum,</p>
<p>they were designed to recalibrate our motor movements</p>
<p>when our relationship to gravity changes,</p>
<p>something fundamental to survival.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t afford to be falling down all the time</p>
<p>or missing things that we grab for,</p>
<p>or running in the wrong direction</p>
<p>when something is pursuing us.</p>
<p>These are hardwired circuits</p>
<p>that tap right into these chemical pathways.</p>
<p>And those chemical pathways are the gates to plasticity.</p>
<p>So I really want to spell this out clearly</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;ve given a lot of information today.</p>
<p>The first thing is how are you arriving</p>
<p>to the learning bout?</p>
<p>You need to make sure your level</p>
<p>of autonomic arousal is correct.</p>
<p>The ideal state is going to be clear, calm, and focused,</p>
<p>maybe a little bit more on the arousal level,</p>
<p>like heightened arousal.</p>
<p>So understand limbic friction,</p>
<p>understand that you can be too tired</p>
<p>in which case you&rsquo;re going to need to get yourself</p>
<p>a little more alert,</p>
<p>or you can be too alert</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to need to get yourself calmer.</p>
<p>That gets you to the starting line.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re at the starting line,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re going to go into a learning bout</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when you want to start making these errors.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m saying is there&rsquo;s a layer in between</p>
<p>where if you are interested in using motor patterns</p>
<p>as a way to open up plasticity for all kinds of learning,</p>
<p>not just motor learning,</p>
<p>disrupting your vestibular motor relationship,</p>
<p>meaning, and I&rsquo;ll tell you how to do that in a moment,</p>
<p>can deploy or release neurochemicals in the brain</p>
<p>that place you into a state</p>
<p>that makes you much better at learning</p>
<p>and making errors much more pleasurable.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re much more willing to do that.</p>
<p>Now, some of you are probably saying flow state, flow state.</p>
<p>Okay, I have friends that work on flow states</p>
<p>and who are involved in flow states</p>
<p>and trying to figure out what they are.</p>
<p>I have great respect for those people.</p>
<p>So I want to tip my hat to them.</p>
<p>Very important work.</p>
<p>But again, flow is an expression</p>
<p>of what you already know how to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not how you learn,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s how you express what you&rsquo;ve already learned.</p>
<p>So I want to be really clear about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been kind of presented as this super state</p>
<p>or highly desirable state,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s that we can all reach for.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the wrong rung to reach for</p>
<p>until you already know how to do the things</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m describing, in my opinion.</p>
<p>So the vestibular system,</p>
<p>if you can engage the vestibular system</p>
<p>and create some errors</p>
<p>within the vestibular motor operations</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re carrying out,</p>
<p>you create a neurochemical state</p>
<p>that then makes you very, very good</p>
<p>at learning very quickly, regardless of age.</p>
<p>So what would this look like?</p>
<p>Does this mean just doing inversions?</p>
<p>Well, does this mean doing yoga?</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Does this mean taking corners faster on your road bike?</p>
<p>Does this mean, let&rsquo;s say you always swim freestyle</p>
<p>or breaststroke?</p>
<p>Does this mean swimming backstroke or butterfly?</p>
<p>It depends.</p>
<p>It depends, however,</p>
<p>on a very, very easy to understand parameter,</p>
<p>which is how regularly you perform</p>
<p>a particular motor behavior</p>
<p>and how novel a behavior is.</p>
<p>So the more novel that a behavior is</p>
<p>in terms of your relationship to gravity,</p>
<p>the more it will open up the opportunity for plasticity.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen somebody</p>
<p>who just jumped out of a plane for a first time</p>
<p>with a parachute?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even want to think about what,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve just seen somebody who jumped out of a plane</p>
<p>for the first time without a parachute,</p>
<p>I would just hope the plane was on the ground.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;ve seen somebody after that,</p>
<p>they are in this incredible state</p>
<p>because their body and brain are flooded</p>
<p>with all these neurochemicals</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very novel to them.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;ve got friends from communities</p>
<p>have done thousands upon thousands,</p>
<p>maybe tens of thousands of jumps,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re always alert and aware,</p>
<p>but it becomes pretty regular for them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not in this kind of buzzed out,</p>
<p>excited state afterwards because it&rsquo;s routine for them.</p>
<p>So the key is to bring novelty</p>
<p>to the vestibular motor experience,</p>
<p>the vestibular motor commands that you&rsquo;re performing.</p>
<p>And how do you do that?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s all about your orientation relative to gravity.</p>
<p>Now, I wouldn&rsquo;t want anyone to place themselves at risk.</p>
<p>So if you can&rsquo;t do handstands,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t try and do them freestanding and whatever.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re good at handstands,</p>
<p>guess how much plasticity doing a handstands</p>
<p>for half an hour is going to create for you?</p>
<p>Zero, zero.</p>
<p>Your body is fully comfortable walking on your hands.</p>
<p>I see these people walking on your hands,</p>
<p>being upside down, being inverted.</p>
<p>You know, your Cirque du Soleil performers,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very comfortable there.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s zero learning, zero plasticity</p>
<p>because the failures and errors</p>
<p>and the relationship to gravity</p>
<p>are very typical for that individual.</p>
<p>Now, what this means is that if we&rsquo;re going to use</p>
<p>motor practices to open up plasticity for learning,</p>
<p>not just those practices, but maybe some cognitive skills</p>
<p>or other things in the period that follows,</p>
<p>we need to create a sense of novelty relative to gravity.</p>
<p>And that means being either in a new position</p>
<p>or slightly unstable.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, I don&rsquo;t want anyone injuring themselves,</p>
<p>but the sensation of falling or close to falling</p>
<p>signals the cerebellum to signal the deep brain centers</p>
<p>that release these neurochemicals,</p>
<p>that something is very different</p>
<p>and we need to correct this error very, very fast.</p>
<p>Now, earlier I was talking about high contingencies</p>
<p>for learning and you definitely don&rsquo;t want to make it</p>
<p>a kind of like either survive this</p>
<p>or die kind of experience.</p>
<p>I confess I occasionally look at these parkour videos</p>
<p>on YouTube and believe it or not,</p>
<p>a lot of those people have died.</p>
<p>The ones that do these ridiculous things</p>
<p>of hanging off of buildings and things.</p>
<p>I am not suggesting you do that.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m talking about is finding safe ways</p>
<p>to explore the sensory motor vestibular space,</p>
<p>as we call it, the relationship between those things.</p>
<p>So that could be through yoga.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re terrible at yoga,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more opportunity for you to learn</p>
<p>than somebody who&rsquo;s very skilled at yoga, for instance,</p>
<p>or gymnastics or handstands or on your road bike.</p>
<p>This is unfortunately what I don&rsquo;t want to name brands,</p>
<p>but stationary bikes where they give you</p>
<p>the visual experience of moving through space,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not actually moving through physical space.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no vestibular feedback.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all visual, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re stationary on the bike, right?</p>
<p>So unless you&rsquo;re hanging off the bike in your living room,</p>
<p>like almost to the point you&rsquo;re tipping the bike,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not getting the actual</p>
<p>vestibular motor sensory mismatch.</p>
<p>That mismatch is the signal that deploys dopamine,</p>
<p>epinephrine, and these other things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care how excited or how much fun the ride was</p>
<p>or how much music you&rsquo;re playing that you love.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the same situation as being out of,</p>
<p>out of your normal relationship to the gravitational pull.</p>
<p>So the first gate is to arrive at learning</p>
<p>at the appropriate level of autonomic arousal.</p>
<p>Clear and focused is best,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t obsess over being right there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay to be a little anxious or a little bit tired.</p>
<p>Then you want to make errors.</p>
<p>We talked about that.</p>
<p>And this vestibular motor sensory relationship</p>
<p>is absolutely key</p>
<p>if you want to get heightened or accelerated plasticity.</p>
<p>And we talked about another feature,</p>
<p>which is setting a contingency.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a reason,</p>
<p>an important reason for you to actually learn,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re making failures,</p>
<p>the learning will be accelerated.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s really four things</p>
<p>that you really need to do for plasticity as an adult.</p>
<p>And I would say that these also apply to young people.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>kind of a thought experiment there as well,</p>
<p>which is if you look at children,</p>
<p>they are moving a lot in different dimensions.</p>
<p>You know, they are hanging,</p>
<p>sometimes hanging from trees or, you know,</p>
<p>I was a kind of a, I was,</p>
<p>my sports were always things where I tended to get hurt a lot,</p>
<p>fall a lot.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a skateboarding for me when I was younger.</p>
<p>So a lot of falling and rolling</p>
<p>and various things of that sort.</p>
<p>But whatever sport the kids are playing,</p>
<p>or even if they don&rsquo;t play a sport,</p>
<p>they tend to move in a lot of different</p>
<p>relationships to gravity,</p>
<p>more dimensionality to their movements,</p>
<p>I should say, than adults.</p>
<p>And one of the questions that&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>kind of been in the back of my mind is,</p>
<p>you know, as we age,</p>
<p>we get less good at engaging in neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Part of that is because as the brain ages,</p>
<p>there are certain changes to the way</p>
<p>that neurons are structured,</p>
<p>their molecular components, et cetera.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s kind of a self-amplifying,</p>
<p>or I should say a self-degenerating cycle,</p>
<p>where as we get older,</p>
<p>we tend to get more linear and more regular</p>
<p>about specific kinds of movements.</p>
<p>So we get on the treadmill, or we take the walk,</p>
<p>or we just always go up the same stairs, et cetera.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s less opportunity typically</p>
<p>for engaging these relationships to the gravitational pull</p>
<p>through the vestibular motor sensory convergence</p>
<p>that we talked about a moment ago.</p>
<p>And so you sort of have to wonder</p>
<p>whether or not the lack of plasticity</p>
<p>or the reduced plasticity in older individuals,</p>
<p>which includes me,</p>
<p>would reflect the fact that those chemicals</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t being deployed because we&rsquo;re not engaging</p>
<p>in certain behaviors,</p>
<p>as opposed to we can&rsquo;t engage in the behaviors</p>
<p>because the chemicals aren&rsquo;t being deployed.</p>
<p>Now, I have a feeling it&rsquo;s both.</p>
<p>These have a reciprocal relationship.</p>
<p>And I certainly, again, I don&rsquo;t think it would be wise</p>
<p>for anyone who doesn&rsquo;t have the muscle stabilizing skills</p>
<p>or the bone density, et cetera,</p>
<p>to start doing inversions and things of that sort.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m talking about here.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s interesting to think about</p>
<p>the sorts of exercise that we engage in.</p>
<p>We all know that getting the heart rate elevated</p>
<p>three to five times a week is really good for us,</p>
<p>for cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a ton of data to support that.</p>
<p>Now, some load-bearing exercise is important</p>
<p>for increasing bone density and maintaining</p>
<p>muscular strength and proprioceptive feedback,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m sure many of you know this,</p>
<p>but resistance exercise actually trains the nerve</p>
<p>to muscle connections as much as it does</p>
<p>the muscles themselves,</p>
<p>something I talked about at the beginning of the episode.</p>
<p>But I think most of us could stand to increase</p>
<p>the degree to which we engage this vestibular system</p>
<p>in novel ways.</p>
<p>And that can be done quite safely</p>
<p>through a number of different mechanisms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a surfer, but people who do that sort of thing</p>
<p>are very familiar with orienting their body differently</p>
<p>according to the gravitational pull.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re lying down, then they&rsquo;re standing up,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re turning, they&rsquo;re leaning their head.</p>
<p>So again, it&rsquo;s this pitch, yaw, roll thing.</p>
<p>And again, if you&rsquo;re very skilled at surfing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually not going to open up plasticity</p>
<p>just by surfing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the learning of these new relationships to gravity</p>
<p>that the windows for plasticity are enhanced.</p>
<p>So I want to make sure that I underscore the fact</p>
<p>that this vestibular thing that I&rsquo;ve been describing</p>
<p>is a way to really accentuate plasticity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tapping into an inborn biological mechanism</p>
<p>where the cerebellum has outputs</p>
<p>to these deep brain nuclei associated with dopamine,</p>
<p>acetylcholine, and norepinephrine.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to endanger yourself</p>
<p>in the course of pursuing these activities,</p>
<p>but it is a powerful mechanism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of an amplifier on plasticity,</p>
<p>as is high contingency.</p>
<p>If you really need to learn conversational French</p>
<p>to save your relationship,</p>
<p>chances are you&rsquo;re going to learn it.</p>
<p>There are limits, of course,</p>
<p>to the extent to which one can accentuate</p>
<p>or accelerate plasticity.</p>
<p>You know, the ceiling on this is not infinite,</p>
<p>although we don&rsquo;t know how high it goes.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s reasonable to say</p>
<p>that if someone put a gun to my head and said,</p>
<p>learn conversational French in the next 120 seconds,</p>
<p>that conversational French would be limited</p>
<p>probably to just one word,</p>
<p>probably the word we, or something like that.</p>
<p>Because I can&rsquo;t stuff in all the knowledge all at once.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that&rsquo;s the dream of brain machine interface</p>
<p>that one will be able to download a chip</p>
<p>into their hippocampus or cortex</p>
<p>or some other brain structure</p>
<p>that would allow them to download conversational French.</p>
<p>And someday we may get to that,</p>
<p>as that capability may come about.</p>
<p>Right now it does not exist,</p>
<p>nor is there a specific pill or chemical</p>
<p>that will allow you to download</p>
<p>more information more quickly.</p>
<p>This is the issue around nootropics</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about before.</p>
<p>There are things that can increase focus,</p>
<p>mainly things that increase acetylcholine</p>
<p>and transmission through the nicotine system,</p>
<p>things that can increase dopamine,</p>
<p>things like L-tyrosine.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not recommending these,</p>
<p>you need to heed the warnings on those bottles,</p>
<p>but they will increase these neurochemicals.</p>
<p>And there are of course things</p>
<p>that will increase epinephrine,</p>
<p>things like caffeine,</p>
<p>or some people because of prescription take Adderall.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m again, not suggesting people take any of these things.</p>
<p>In fact, today I focused almost exclusively</p>
<p>on behavioral tools and ways of structuring learning bouts</p>
<p>that will allow you to access</p>
<p>more plasticity regardless of age.</p>
<p>And they center around things that I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>if you look around you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see evidence for,</p>
<p>oh, incremental learning is powerful,</p>
<p>or oh, the vestibular system</p>
<p>can open up opportunities for plasticity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that the yogis out there are all saying,</p>
<p>wait, this sounds exactly like yoga.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re supposed to push to an edge</p>
<p>and do these inversions and do all those sorts of things.</p>
<p>Well, I want to be clear.</p>
<p>I never said anyone should do inversions.</p>
<p>I said that the vestibular system is a valuable portal</p>
<p>into some of these neurochemical states</p>
<p>that favor plasticity.</p>
<p>But not so seldom I hear from the yoga community</p>
<p>and they will say things like,</p>
<p>much of what you&rsquo;re saying about how the brain works</p>
<p>or neuroplasticity has already been described</p>
<p>or is embedded in yoga practices.</p>
<p>And I just want to be very clear.</p>
<p>I have tremendous respect for the yoga community</p>
<p>and the practices.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done yoga from time to time.</p>
<p>I find it challenging and valuable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a regular practitioner.</p>
<p>But the problem with yoga</p>
<p>is exactly the same problem with science,</p>
<p>which is that yoga has a lot of practices</p>
<p>for which there are very specific names,</p>
<p>but no description</p>
<p>or lending of understanding about mechanism.</p>
<p>And science has a lot of mechanisms</p>
<p>and a lot of publications and papers</p>
<p>for which there&rsquo;s very little, if not no description</p>
<p>of tools and practices.</p>
<p>So my goal in not just today,</p>
<p>but in many ways throughout the course of the podcast</p>
<p>is to bridge the gaps between these various disciplines</p>
<p>in ways that are grounded mainly</p>
<p>to the fields of neuroscience and some related fields.</p>
<p>So yes, it&rsquo;s true that I look at things</p>
<p>mainly through the lens of science,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not to say</p>
<p>that it exhaustively explains everything about anything,</p>
<p>nor is it to say that it&rsquo;s the only lens</p>
<p>through which one could look at</p>
<p>something like neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>So I just want to acknowledge that I have great respect</p>
<p>for all these different practices and communities.</p>
<p>And I think that indeed there are many cases</p>
<p>in which different communities and practices</p>
<p>have been aimed at targeting the same goals or outcomes.</p>
<p>Science and neuroscience</p>
<p>through an understanding of mechanism</p>
<p>can allow all of us to gain a kind of common understanding</p>
<p>about what those practices are</p>
<p>and how to access things like neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>sleep, et cetera.</p>
<p>And I do believe, as I&rsquo;ve said previously on this podcast,</p>
<p>that understanding mechanism</p>
<p>affords us a certain flexibility,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t mean physical flexibility.</p>
<p>I mean a flexibility</p>
<p>when we can&rsquo;t engage in a particular behavior.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;re injured</p>
<p>or maybe we&rsquo;re not in the right situation</p>
<p>to do a particular practice.</p>
<p>But by thinking about mechanism,</p>
<p>we can adapt our circumstances.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about this with sleep.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re rigidly attached to one protocol</p>
<p>of always looking at sunlight</p>
<p>at one particular time in the morning and in the evening,</p>
<p>that is not as valuable as understanding the mechanisms</p>
<p>of why you might look at sunlight</p>
<p>at one particular time versus another,</p>
<p>because that affords you a flexibility,</p>
<p>allows you to adapt.</p>
<p>And life is very dynamic,</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t have control</p>
<p>over all the external conditions all the time.</p>
<p>And so understanding mechanism</p>
<p>through the lens of neuroscience,</p>
<p>I do believe can be very powerful</p>
<p>because of course there are multiple ways to access dopamine.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to adjust limbic friction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just through respiration.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many ways to do that.</p>
<p>And so my overall goal here in this episode</p>
<p>and with this podcast</p>
<p>is to give you some understanding of the mechanisms</p>
<p>and the insights into the underlying biology</p>
<p>that allow you to tailor</p>
<p>what these kind of foundational mechanisms are</p>
<p>to suit your particular learning needs.</p>

<p>I know it&rsquo;s a lot of information</p>
<p>and it takes a bit of focus and attention</p>
<p>and certainly will trigger plasticity</p>
<p>to learn all this information.</p>
<p>I want to encourage you and just remind you</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t have to grasp it all at once,</p>
<p>that it is here archived,</p>
<p>and that if you want to return to the information,</p>
<p>it will still be here,</p>
<p>and that I most of all</p>
<p>really appreciate your interest in science.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
