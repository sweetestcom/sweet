    <p>The following is a conversation with Cal Newport.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a friend and someone who&rsquo;s writing,</p>
<p>like his book, Deep Work, for example,</p>
<p>has guided how I strive to approach productivity</p>
<p>and life in general.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t use social media,</p>
<p>and in his book, Digital Minimalism,</p>
<p>he encourages people to find the right amount</p>
<p>of social media usage that provides value and joy.</p>
<p>He has a new book out called A World Without Email,</p>
<p>where he argues brilliantly, I would say,</p>
<p>that email is destroying productivity in companies</p>
<p>and in our lives.</p>
<p>And very importantly, he offers solutions.</p>
<p>He is a computer scientist at Georgetown University</p>
<p>who practices what he preaches.</p>
<p>To do theoretical computer science</p>
<p>at the level that he does it,</p>
<p>you really have to live a focused life</p>
<p>that minimizes distractions</p>
<p>and maximizes hours of deep work.</p>
<p>Lastly, he&rsquo;s a host of an amazing podcast</p>
<p>called Deep Questions that I highly recommend</p>
<p>for anyone who wants to improve their productive life.</p>

<p>As a side note, let me say that deep work</p>
<p>or long periods of deep, focused thinking</p>
<p>have been something I&rsquo;ve been chasing more and more</p>
<p>over the past few years.</p>
<p>Deep work is hard, but is ultimately the thing</p>
<p>that makes life so damn amazing.</p>
<p>The ability to create things you&rsquo;re passionate about</p>
<p>in a flow state where the distractions of the world</p>
<p>just fade away.</p>
<p>Social media, yes, reading the comments,</p>
<p>yes, I still read the comments,</p>
<p>is a source of joy for me in strict moderation.</p>
<p>Too much takes away the focused mind</p>
<p>and too little, at least I think,</p>
<p>takes away all of the fun.</p>
<p>We need both, the focus and the fun.</p>

<p>at Lex Friedman if you can only figure out</p>
<p>how to spell that.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Cal Newport.</p>
<p>What is deep work?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a big question.</p>
<p>So I mean, it&rsquo;s my term for when you&rsquo;re focusing</p>
<p>without distraction on a cognitively demanding task,</p>
<p>which is something we&rsquo;ve all done,</p>
<p>but we had never really given it a name necessarily</p>
<p>that was separate from other type of work.</p>
<p>And so I gave it a name and said,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s compare that to other types of efforts</p>
<p>you might do while you&rsquo;re working</p>
<p>and see that the deep work efforts actually have</p>
<p>a huge benefit that we might be underestimating.</p>
<p>What does it mean to work deeply on something?</p>
<p>I had been calling it hard focus in my writing before that.</p>
<p>Well, so the context you would understand,</p>
<p>I was in the theory group in CSAIL at MIT, right?</p>
<p>So I was surrounded at the time</p>
<p>when I was coming up with these ideas</p>
<p>by these professional theoreticians.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like a murderer&rsquo;s row of thinkers there, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like Turing Award, Turing Award,</p>
<p>MacArthur, Turing Award.</p>
<p>I mean, you know the crew, right?</p>
<p>Theoretical computer science.</p>
<p>Theoretical computer science, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m in the theory group, right?</p>
<p>Doing theoretical computer science and I publish a book.</p>
<p>So I was in this milieu where I was being exposed to people</p>
<p>where focus was their tier one skill.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s what you would talk about, right?</p>
<p>Like how intensely I can focus.</p>
<p>That was the key skill.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like your 440 time or something</p>
<p>if you were an athlete, right?</p>
<p>So this is something that people actually,</p>
<p>the theory folks are thinking about?</p>
<p>Oh yeah. Really?</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re openly discussing like, how do you focus?</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if they would quantify it,</p>
<p>but focus was the tier one skill.</p>
<p>So you would come in, here would be a typical day.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d come in and Eric DeMain would be sitting</p>
<p>in front of a whiteboard, right?</p>
<p>With a whole group of visitors</p>
<p>who had come to work with them.</p>
<p>And maybe they projected like a grid on there</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re working on some graph theory problem.</p>
<p>You go to lunch, you go to the gym, you come back,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re sitting there staring at the same whiteboard, right?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s the tier one skill.</p>
<p>This is the difference between different disciplines.</p>
<p>Like I often feel for many reasons, like a fraud,</p>
<p>but I definitely feel like a fraud when I hang out</p>
<p>with like either mathematicians or physicists.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it feels like they&rsquo;re doing the legit work</p>
<p>because when you talk closer in computer science,</p>
<p>you get to programming or like machine learning,</p>
<p>like the experimental machine learning</p>
<p>or like just the engineering version of it.</p>
<p>It feels like you&rsquo;re gone so far away</p>
<p>from what&rsquo;s required to solve something fundamental</p>
<p>about this universe.</p>
<p>It feels like you&rsquo;re just like cheating your way</p>
<p>into like some kind of trick to figure out</p>
<p>how to solve a problem in this one particular case.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it feels.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be interested to hear what you think about that</p>
<p>because programming doesn&rsquo;t always feel</p>
<p>like you need to think deeply to work deeply,</p>
<p>but sometimes it does.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a weird dance.</p>
<p>For sure code does, right?</p>
<p>I mean, especially if you&rsquo;re coming up</p>
<p>with original algorithmic designs,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a great example of deep work.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, the hardcore theoreticians,</p>
<p>they push it to an extreme.</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s like knowing</p>
<p>that athletic endeavor is good</p>
<p>and then hanging out with a Olympic athlete,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, oh, I see that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>Now for the grad students like me,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not anywhere near that level,</p>
<p>but the faculty in that group,</p>
<p>these were the cognitive Olympic athletes.</p>
<p>But coding I think is a classic example of deep work</p>
<p>because I got this problem I wanna solve,</p>
<p>I have all of these tools</p>
<p>and I have to combine them somehow creatively</p>
<p>and on the fly.</p>
<p>But so basically I had been exposed to that.</p>
<p>So I was used to this notion when I was in grad school</p>
<p>and I was writing my blog, I&rsquo;d write about hard focus.</p>
<p>That was the term I used.</p>
<p>Then I published this book,</p>
<p>So Good They Can&rsquo;t Ignore You, which came out in 2012.</p>
<p>So like right as I began as a professor.</p>
<p>And that book had this notion of skill</p>
<p>being really important for career satisfaction,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not just following your passion.</p>
<p>You have to actually really get good at something</p>
<p>and then you use that skills as leverage.</p>
<p>And there was this big followup question to that book</p>
<p>of, okay, well, how do I get really good at things?</p>
<p>And then I look back to my grad school experience,</p>
<p>I was like, huh, there was this focus thing</p>
<p>that we used to do.</p>
<p>And I wonder how generally applicable that is</p>
<p>into the knowledge sector.</p>
<p>And so as I started thinking about it, it became clear,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this interesting storyline that emerged</p>
<p>that, okay, actually undistracted concentration</p>
<p>is not just important for esoteric theoreticians,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important here, it&rsquo;s important here,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important here.</p>
<p>And that involved into the deep work hypothesis,</p>
<p>which is across the whole knowledge work sector.</p>
<p>Focus is very important</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve accidentally created circumstances</p>
<p>where we just don&rsquo;t do a lot of it.</p>
<p>So focus is the sort of prerequisite for basically,</p>
<p>you say knowledge work,</p>
<p>but basically any kind of skill acquisition,</p>
<p>any kind of major effort in this world.</p>
<p>Can we break that apart a little bit?</p>
<p>Yeah, so a key aspect of focus is not just</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re concentrating hard on something,</p>
<p>but you do it without distraction.</p>
<p>So a big theme of my work is that context shifting</p>
<p>kills the human capacity to think.</p>
<p>So if I change what I&rsquo;m paying attention to</p>
<p>to something different, really, even if it&rsquo;s brief</p>
<p>and then try to bring it back to the main thing I&rsquo;m doing,</p>
<p>that causes a huge cognitive pile up</p>
<p>that makes it very hard to think clearly.</p>
<p>So even if you think, okay, look, I&rsquo;m writing this code</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m writing this essay and I&rsquo;m not multitasking</p>
<p>and all my windows are closed</p>
<p>and I have no notifications on,</p>
<p>but every five or six minutes you quickly check</p>
<p>like an inbox or your phone,</p>
<p>that initiates a context shift in your brain, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna start to suppress some neural networks,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna try to amplify some others.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty complicated process actually.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sort of neurological cascade that happens.</p>
<p>You rip yourself away from that halfway through</p>
<p>and go back to what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s trying to switch back to the original thing</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s also your brain&rsquo;s in the process</p>
<p>of switching to these emails</p>
<p>and trying to understand those contexts.</p>
<p>And as a result, your ability to think clearly</p>
<p>just goes really down.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fatiguing too.</p>
<p>I mean, you do this long enough and you get midday</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, okay, I can&rsquo;t think anymore.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve exhausted yourself.</p>
<p>Is there some kind of perfect number of minutes,</p>
<p>would you say?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about focusing on a particular task</p>
<p>for one minute, five minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Is it possible to kind of context switch</p>
<p>while maintaining deep focus every 20 minutes or so?</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re thinking of like this,</p>
<p>again, maybe it&rsquo;s a selfish kind of perspective,</p>
<p>but if you think about programming,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re focused on a particular design of a little bit,</p>
<p>maybe a small scale on a particular function</p>
<p>or large scale on a system.</p>
<p>And then the shift of focus happens like this,</p>
<p>which is like, wait a minute,</p>
<p>is there a library that can achieve this little task</p>
<p>or something like that?</p>
<p>And then you have to look it up.</p>
<p>This is the danger zone.</p>
<p>You go to the internets.</p>
<p>And so you have to, now it is a kind of context switch</p>
<p>because as opposed to thinking about the particular problem,</p>
<p>you now have switch thinking about like consuming</p>
<p>and integrating knowledge that&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>that can plug into your solution to a particular problem.</p>
<p>It definitely feels like a context switch,</p>
<p>but is that a really bad thing to do?</p>
<p>So should you be setting it aside always</p>
<p>and really trying to as much as possible go deep</p>
<p>and stay there for like a really long period of time?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I think if you&rsquo;re looking up a library</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s relevant to what you&rsquo;re doing, that&rsquo;s probably okay.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know that I would count that</p>
<p>as a full context shift because the semantic networks</p>
<p>involved are relatively similar, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re thinking about this type of solution.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re thinking about coding.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re thinking about this type of functions.</p>
<p>Where you&rsquo;re really gonna get hit</p>
<p>is if you switch your context</p>
<p>to something that&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s unresolved obligations.</p>
<p>So really the worst possible thing you could do</p>
<p>would be to look at like an email inbox, right?</p>
<p>Cause here&rsquo;s 20 emails.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t answer most of these right now.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re completely different.</p>
<p>Like the context of these emails,</p>
<p>like, okay, there&rsquo;s a grant funding issue</p>
<p>or something like this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very different than the coding I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m leaving it unresolved.</p>
<p>So like someone needs something from me</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna try to pull my attention back.</p>
<p>The second worst would be something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s emotionally arousing.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re like, let me just glance over at Twitter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s nice and calm and peaceful over there, right?</p>
<p>That could be devastating</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re gonna expose yourself</p>
<p>to something that&rsquo;s emotionally arousing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna completely mess up the cognitive plateau there.</p>
<p>And then when you come back to,</p>
<p>okay, let me try to code again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really difficult.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s both the information and the emotion.</p>
<p>Yeah, both can be killers if what you&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>So I would recommend at least an hour at a time</p>
<p>because it could take up to 20 minutes</p>
<p>to completely clear out the residue</p>
<p>from whatever it was you were thinking about before.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re coding for 30 minutes,</p>
<p>you might only be getting 10 or 15 minutes</p>
<p>of actual sort of peak lacks going on there, right?</p>
<p>So an hour at least you get a good 40, 45 minutes plus.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m partial to 90 minutes as a really good chunk.</p>
<p>We can get a lot done.</p>
<p>But just before you get exhausted,</p>
<p>you can sort of pull back a little bit.</p>
<p>Yeah, and one of the beautiful,</p>
<p>people can read about it in your book, Deep Work.</p>
<p>And I know this has been out for a long time</p>
<p>and people are probably familiar with many of the concepts,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still pretty profound</p>
<p>and it has stayed with me for a long time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about adding the terms to it</p>
<p>that actually solidifies the concepts.</p>
<p>Like words matter, it&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>
<p>And just for me, sort of as a comment,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a struggle and it&rsquo;s very difficult</p>
<p>to maintain focus for a prolonged period of time.</p>
<p>But the days on which I&rsquo;m able to accomplish</p>
<p>several hours of that kind of work, I&rsquo;m happy.</p>
<p>So forget being productive and all that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just satisfied with my life.</p>
<p>I feel fulfilled, it&rsquo;s like joyful.</p>
<p>And then I can be, I&rsquo;m less of a dick</p>
<p>to other people in my life afterwards.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>And I find the opposite when I don&rsquo;t do that kind of thing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m much more irritable.</p>
<p>Like I feel like I didn&rsquo;t accomplish anything</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this stress that then the negative emotion</p>
<p>builds up to where you&rsquo;re no longer able</p>
<p>to sort of enjoy the hell out of this amazing life.</p>
<p>So in that sense, Deep Work has been a source</p>
<p>of a lot of happiness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to ask you, how do you,</p>
<p>again, you cover this in the book,</p>
<p>but how do you integrate Deep Work into your life?</p>
<p>What are different scheduling strategies</p>
<p>that you would recommend just at a high level?</p>
<p>What are different ideas there?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I&rsquo;m a big fan of time blocking, right?</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re facing your workday,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t allow like your inbox or a to do list</p>
<p>to sort of drive you.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t just come into your day and think,</p>
<p>what do I wanna do next?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m a big planner saying,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the time available, let me make a plan for it.</p>
<p>So I have a meeting here, I have an appointment here,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s left, what do I actually wanna do with it?</p>
<p>So in this half hour, I&rsquo;m gonna work on this.</p>
<p>For this 90 minute block, I&rsquo;m gonna work on that.</p>
<p>And during this hour, I&rsquo;m gonna try to fit this in.</p>
<p>And then actually I have this half hour gap</p>
<p>between two meetings.</p>
<p>So why don&rsquo;t I take advantage of that</p>
<p>to go run five errands,</p>
<p>I can kind of batch those together.</p>
<p>But blocking out in advance,</p>
<p>this is what I wanna do with the time available.</p>
<p>I mean, I find that&rsquo;s much more effective.</p>
<p>Now, once you&rsquo;re doing this,</p>
<p>once you&rsquo;re in a discipline of time blocking,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s much easier to actually see,</p>
<p>this is where I want, for example, the Deep Work.</p>
<p>And I can get a handle on the other things</p>
<p>that need to happen and find better places to fit them</p>
<p>so I can prioritize this.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re gonna get a lot more of that done</p>
<p>than if it&rsquo;s just going through your day</p>
<p>and saying, what&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>I schedule every single day kind of thing.</p>
<p>So as I could try to do in the morning</p>
<p>to try to have a plan.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I do a quarterly, weekly, daily planning.</p>
<p>So at the semester or quarterly level,</p>
<p>I have a big picture vision</p>
<p>for what I&rsquo;m trying to get done during the fall,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, or during the winter.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a deadline coming up for academic papers</p>
<p>at the end of the season, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m working on.</p>
<p>I wanna have this many chapters done of a book,</p>
<p>something like this.</p>
<p>Like you have the big picture vision</p>
<p>of what you wanna get done.</p>
<p>Then weekly, you look at that,</p>
<p>and then you look at your week</p>
<p>and you put together a plan for like,</p>
<p>okay, what&rsquo;s my week gonna look like?</p>
<p>What do I need to do?</p>
<p>How am I gonna make progress on these things?</p>
<p>Maybe I need to do an hour every morning</p>
<p>or I see that Monday is my only really empty day.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s gonna be the day that I really need to nail</p>
<p>on writing or something like this.</p>
<p>And then every day, you look at your weekly plan</p>
<p>and say, let me block off the actual hours.</p>
<p>So you do that three scales,</p>
<p>the quarterly, down to weekly, down to daily.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re talking about actual times of day versus,</p>
<p>so the alternative is what I end up doing a lot,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s the best way to do it,</p>
<p>is scheduling the duration of time.</p>
<p>This is called the luxury when you don&rsquo;t have any meetings.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, religiously don&rsquo;t do meetings.</p>
<p>All other academics are jealous of you, by the way.</p>
<p>Yeah. I know.</p>
<p>No Zoom meetings.</p>
<p>I find those are,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the worst tragedies of the pandemic,</p>
<p>is both the opportunity to,</p>
<p>the positive thing is to have more time with your family,</p>
<p>sort of reconnect in many ways.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Be able to remotely sort of not waste time on travel</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>The negative is, actually both those things</p>
<p>are also sourced from the negative.</p>
<p>But the negative is like,</p>
<p>it seems like people have multiplied the number of meetings</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re so easy to schedule.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s nothing more draining to me intellectually,</p>
<p>philosophically, just my spirit is destroyed</p>
<p>by even a 10 minute Zoom meeting.</p>
<p>Like, what are we doing here?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Yeah, I have, every Zoom meeting is,</p>
<p>I have an existential crisis, so.</p>
<p>Kierkegaard with the internet connection.</p>
<p>So, what the hell are we talking about?</p>
<p>Oh, so when you don&rsquo;t have meetings,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a luxury to really allow for certain things</p>
<p>if they need to, like the important things,</p>
<p>like deep work sessions to last way longer</p>
<p>than you maybe planned for.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s my goal is to try to schedule,</p>
<p>the goal is to schedule,</p>
<p>to sit and focus for a particular task for an hour</p>
<p>and hope I can keep going and hope I can get lost in it.</p>
<p>And do you find that this is at all an okay way to go</p>
<p>and the time blocking is just something you have to do</p>
<p>to actually be an adult and operate in this real world?</p>
<p>Or is there some magic to the time blocking?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, there&rsquo;s magic to the intention.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s magic to it if you have varied responsibilities.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m often juggling multiple jobs, essentially.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s academic stuff, there&rsquo;s teaching stuff,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s book stuff, there&rsquo;s the business</p>
<p>surrounding my book stuff.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m of your same mindset.</p>
<p>If a deep work session is going well,</p>
<p>you just rock and roll and let it go on.</p>
<p>So like one of the big keys of time block,</p>
<p>at least the way I do it,</p>
<p>so I even sell this planner to help people time block,</p>
<p>it has many columns because the discipline is,</p>
<p>oh, if your initial schedule changes,</p>
<p>you just move over one.</p>
<p>Next time you get a chance, you move over one column</p>
<p>and then you just fix it for the time that&rsquo;s remaining.</p>
<p>So in other words, there&rsquo;s no bonus</p>
<p>for I made a schedule and I stuck with it.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s actually,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like you get a prize for it, right?</p>
<p>Like for me, the prize is I have an intentional plan</p>
<p>for my time and if I have to change that plan, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Like the state I wanna be is basically</p>
<p>at any point in the day, I&rsquo;ve thought about</p>
<p>what time remains and gave it some thought</p>
<p>for what to do because I&rsquo;ll do the same thing,</p>
<p>even though I have a lot more meetings</p>
<p>and other types of things I have to do in my various jobs</p>
<p>and I basically prioritize the deep work</p>
<p>and they get yelled at a lot.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of my strategy is like,</p>
<p>just be okay, just be okay getting yelled at a lot</p>
<p>because I feel you, if you&rsquo;re rolling, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what it is for me, like with writing,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s writing so hard in a certain way</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s, you don&rsquo;t really get on a roll in some sense,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s just difficult, but working on proofs,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard to pull yourself away from a proof</p>
<p>if you start to get some traction,</p>
<p>just you&rsquo;ve been at it for a couple of hours</p>
<p>and you feel the pins and tumblers</p>
<p>starting to click together and progress is being made,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to pull away from that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m willing to get yelled at by almost everyone.</p>
<p>Of course, there is also a positive effect</p>
<p>to pulling yourself out of it when things are going great</p>
<p>because then you&rsquo;re kind of excited to resume.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like stopping on a dead end.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an extra force of procrastination</p>
<p>that comes with if you stop on a dead end</p>
<p>to return to the task.</p>
<p>Yeah, or a cold start.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Whenever I feel like I&rsquo;m in a stage now,</p>
<p>I submitted a few papers recently.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re sort of starting something up from cold</p>
<p>and it takes way too long to get going</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very hard to get the motivation</p>
<p>to schedule a time when it&rsquo;s not, yeah, we&rsquo;re in it.</p>
<p>Like here&rsquo;s where we are.</p>
<p>We feel like something&rsquo;s about to give here.</p>
<p>We need the very early stages where it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m gonna read hard papers</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna be hard to understand them</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna have no idea how to make progress.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not motivating.</p>
<p>What about deadlines?</p>
<p>Can we, okay, so this is like a therapy session.</p>
<p>It seems like I only get stuff done that has deadlines.</p>
<p>And so one of the implied powerful things</p>
<p>about time blocking is there&rsquo;s a kind of deadline</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s a artificial or real sense of urgency.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible to get anything done</p>
<p>in this world without deadlines?</p>
<p>Why do deadlines work so well?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, it&rsquo;s a clear motivational signal,</p>
<p>but in the short term, you do get an effect like that</p>
<p>in time blocking.</p>
<p>I think the strong effect you get by saying,</p>
<p>this is the exact time I&rsquo;m gonna work on this,</p>
<p>is that you don&rsquo;t have the debate with yourself</p>
<p>every three minutes about, should I take a break now?</p>
<p>This is the big issue with just saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go write.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna write for a while and that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>because your mind is saying,</p>
<p>well, obviously we&rsquo;re gonna take some breaks.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not just gonna write forever.</p>
<p>And so why not right now?</p>
<p>You have to be like, well, not right now.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go a little bit longer, five minutes.</p>
<p>So why don&rsquo;t we just take a break now?</p>
<p>We should probably look at the internet.</p>
<p>Now you have to constantly have this battle.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you&rsquo;re in a time block schedule,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got these two hours put aside for writing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m supposed to be doing.</p>
<p>I have a break scheduled over here.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to fight with myself, right?</p>
<p>And maybe at a larger scale,</p>
<p>deadlines give you a similar sort of effect.</p>
<p>I know this is what I&rsquo;m supposed to be working on</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s due.</p>
<p>Perhaps, but will you describe it as much healthier</p>
<p>sort of giving yourself over,</p>
<p>and you talk about this in the new email book,</p>
<p>the process, I mean, in general,</p>
<p>you talk about it all over, is creating a process</p>
<p>and then giving yourself over to the process.</p>
<p>But then you have to be strict with yourself.</p>
<p>Yeah, but what are the deadlines you&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like with papers,</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s the main type of deadline work?</p>
<p>Well, so papers, definitely,</p>
<p>but publications, like say this podcast,</p>
<p>I have to publish this podcast early next week,</p>
<p>one, because your book is coming out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to sort of support this amazing book,</p>
<p>but the other is I have to fly to Vegas on Thursday</p>
<p>to run 40 miles with David Goggins.</p>
<p>And so I want this podcast,</p>
<p>this conversation we&rsquo;re doing now to be out of my life.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t wanna be in a hotel in Vegas,</p>
<p>like freaking out while David Goggins is yelling.</p>
<p>On hour 43 of your Tarathon thing.</p>
<p>But actually it&rsquo;s possible that I still will be doing that</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s not a hard, that&rsquo;s a softer deadline, right?</p>
<p>But those are sort of,</p>
<p>life imposes these kinds of deadlines.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, so yeah,</p>
<p>papers are nice because there&rsquo;s an actual deadline.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I am almost referring to like the pressure</p>
<p>that people put on you.</p>
<p>Hey man, you said you&rsquo;re gonna get this done two months ago.</p>
<p>Why haven&rsquo;t you gotten it done?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see, I don&rsquo;t like that pressure.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>First of all, I think we can all.</p>
<p>I hate it too.</p>
<p>We can agree, by the way, having David Goggins yell at you</p>
<p>is probably the top productivity technique.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;d all get a lot more done</p>
<p>if he was yelling, but see, I don&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>So I will try to get things done early.</p>
<p>I like having flex.</p>
<p>I also don&rsquo;t like the idea of this has to get done today.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s due at midnight and we&rsquo;ve got a lot to do</p>
<p>as the night before,</p>
<p>because then I get in my head about what if I get sick?</p>
<p>Or like, what if, you know,</p>
<p>what if I don&rsquo;t get a bad night&rsquo;s sleep</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t think clearly?</p>
<p>So I like to have the flex.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m all process.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like the philosophical aspect</p>
<p>of that book, Deep Work,</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s something very human and deep</p>
<p>about just wrangling with the world of ideas.</p>
<p>I mean, Aristotle talked about this.</p>
<p>If you go back and read the ethics,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s trying to understand the meaning of life</p>
<p>and he eventually ends up ultimately</p>
<p>at the human capacity to contemplate deeply.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like a teleological argument.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the things that only humans can do</p>
<p>and therefore it must be somehow connected to our ends.</p>
<p>And he said, ultimately that&rsquo;s where he found his meaning,</p>
<p>but, you know, he&rsquo;s touching on some sort of intimation</p>
<p>there that&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>And so what I try to build my life around</p>
<p>is regularly thinking hard about stuff that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Just like if you get a fitness habit going,</p>
<p>you feel off when you don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>I try to get that cognitive habit.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, I got it.</p>
<p>I mean, look, I have my bag here somewhere,</p>
<p>I have my notebook in it because I was thinking</p>
<p>on the Uber ride over, I was like, you know,</p>
<p>I could get some, I&rsquo;m working on this new proof</p>
<p>and it just, so you train yourself.</p>
<p>You train yourself to appreciate certain things.</p>
<p>And then over time, the hope is that it accretes.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s talk about some demons</p>
<p>because I wonder there&rsquo;s like deep work,</p>
<p>which and the world without email books</p>
<p>that to me symbolize the life I want to live.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And then there is, I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>despite appearances and adult at this point,</p>
<p>and this is the life I actually live.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m in constant chaos.</p>
<p>You said you don&rsquo;t like that anxiety.</p>
<p>I hate it too.</p>
<p>But it seems like I&rsquo;m always in it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a giant mess.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s almost like whenever I establish,</p>
<p>whenever I have successful processes for doing deep work,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll add stuff on top of it just to introduce the chaos.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And like, I don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But you have to look in the mirror at a certain point</p>
<p>and you have to say like, who the hell am I?</p>
<p>Like, I keep doing this.</p>
<p>Is this something that&rsquo;s fundamental to who I am</p>
<p>or do I really need to fix this?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the chaos right now?</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;ve seen your video about like your routine.</p>
<p>It seemed very structured and deep.</p>
<p>In fact, I was really envious of it.</p>
<p>So like, what&rsquo;s the chaos now that&rsquo;s not in that video?</p>
<p>Many of those sessions go way longer.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get enough sleep.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then I, the main introduction of chaos is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s taking on too many things on the to do list.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I mean, I suppose it&rsquo;s a problem</p>
<p>that everybody deals with,</p>
<p>which is saying, not saying no.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not like I have trouble saying no.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that there&rsquo;s so much cool shit in my life.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, listen, there&rsquo;s nothing I love more in this world</p>
<p>than the Boston Dynamics robots.</p>
<p>Spot and the other, yeah.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re giving me spot.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a to do, what am I gonna say?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re getting me spot</p>
<p>and I wanna do some computer vision stuff</p>
<p>for the hell of it.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s now a to do item.</p>
<p>And then you go to Texas for a while.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Texas.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all the interesting people down there.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s surprises, right?</p>
<p>There are power outages in Texas.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s constant changes to plans</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And you sleep less.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s personal stuff,</p>
<p>like just people in your life, sources of stress,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But it does feel like if I&rsquo;m just being introspective,</p>
<p>that I bring it onto myself.</p>
<p>I suppose a lot of people do this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is they flourish under pressure.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I wonder if that&rsquo;s just a hack I&rsquo;ve developed</p>
<p>as a habit early on in life</p>
<p>that you need to let go of, you need to fix.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s all interesting things.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, because these are all interesting things.</p>
<p>Well, one of the things you talked about in Deep Work,</p>
<p>which is really important, is having an end to the day.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like putting it down.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like that, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever done that in my life.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, see, I started doing that early</p>
<p>because I got married early.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t have a real job.</p>
<p>I was a grad student, but my wife had a real job.</p>
<p>And so I just figured I should do my work</p>
<p>when she&rsquo;s at work.</p>
<p>Because hey, when work&rsquo;s over, she&rsquo;ll be home,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t wanna be on campus or whatever.</p>
<p>And so real early on, I just got in that habit</p>
<p>of this is when you end work.</p>
<p>And then when I was a postdoc,</p>
<p>which is kind of an easy job, right?</p>
<p>I put artificial, I was like, I wanna train.</p>
<p>I was like, when I&rsquo;m a professor, it&rsquo;s gonna be busier</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s demands that professors have beyond research.</p>
<p>And so as a postdoc,</p>
<p>I added artificial large time consuming things</p>
<p>into the middle of my day.</p>
<p>I basically exercise for two hours in the middle of the day</p>
<p>and do all this productive meditation and stuff like this,</p>
<p>while still maintaining the nine to five.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, okay, I wanna get really good</p>
<p>at putting artificial constraints on so that I stay,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t wanna get flabby when my job was easy.</p>
<p>So that when I became a professor,</p>
<p>and now all of that&rsquo;s paying off</p>
<p>because I have a ton of kids.</p>
<p>So now I don&rsquo;t really have a choice.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s probably keeping me away from cool things</p>
<p>is I just don&rsquo;t have time to do them.</p>
<p>And then after a while people stop bothering.</p>
<p>Well, but that&rsquo;s how you have a successful life.</p>
<p>Otherwise you&rsquo;re going to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too easy to then go into the full Hunter S. Thompson.</p>
<p>Like to where nobody wants,</p>
<p>nobody functional wants to be in your vicinity.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re driving, you attract the people</p>
<p>that have a similar behavior pattern as you.</p>
<p>So if you live in chaos,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to attract chaotic people.</p>
<p>And then it becomes like this self fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p>And it feels like I&rsquo;m not bothered by it,</p>
<p>but I guess this is all coming around</p>
<p>to exactly what you&rsquo;re saying, which is like,</p>
<p>I think one of the big hacks for productive people</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve met is to get married and have kids, honestly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very perhaps counterintuitive,</p>
<p>but it gets, it&rsquo;s like the ultimate timetable enforcer.</p>
<p>Yeah, it enforces a lot of timetables,</p>
<p>though it has a huge,</p>
<p>kids have a huge productivity hit those, you gotta weigh it.</p>
<p>But okay, here&rsquo;s the complicated thing though.</p>
<p>Like you could think about in your own life,</p>
<p>starting the podcast as one of these</p>
<p>just cool opportunities that you put on yourself, right?</p>
<p>Like I could have been talking to you at MIT four years ago</p>
<p>and be like, don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Like your research is going well, right?</p>
<p>But then everyone who watches you is like,</p>
<p>okay, this podcast is,</p>
<p>the direction that&rsquo;s taking you</p>
<p>is like a couple of years from now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna, it&rsquo;ll be something really monumental</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re probably, that&rsquo;s gonna probably lead to, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be some really,</p>
<p>it just feels like your life is going somewhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going somewhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Unexpected, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so how do you balance those two things?</p>
<p>And so what I try to throw at it</p>
<p>is this motto of do less, do better, know why, right?</p>
<p>So do less, do better, know why.</p>
<p>It used to be the motto of my website years ago.</p>
<p>So do a few things, but like an interesting array, right?</p>
<p>So I was doing MIT stuff, but I was also writing, you know?</p>
<p>So a couple of things are, you know, they were interesting.</p>
<p>Like I have a couple bets placed</p>
<p>on a couple of different numbers on the roulette table,</p>
<p>but not too many things.</p>
<p>And then really try to do those things really well</p>
<p>and see where it goes.</p>
<p>Like with my writing,</p>
<p>I just spent years and years and years just training.</p>
<p>I was like, I wanna be a better writer,</p>
<p>I wanna be a better writer.</p>
<p>I started writing student books when I was a student.</p>
<p>I really wanted to write hardcover idea books.</p>
<p>I started training.</p>
<p>I would use like New Yorker articles to train myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d break them down and then I&rsquo;d get commissions</p>
<p>with much smaller magazines and practice the skills.</p>
<p>And it took forever until, you know, but now today,</p>
<p>like I actually get to write for the New Yorker,</p>
<p>but it took like a decade.</p>
<p>So a small number of things, try to do them really well.</p>
<p>And then the know why is have a connection</p>
<p>to some sort of value.</p>
<p>Like in general, I think this is worth doing</p>
<p>and then seeing where it leads.</p>
<p>And so the choice of the few things is grounded in what?</p>
<p>Like a little flame of passion, like a love for the thing,</p>
<p>like a sense that you say you wanted to write,</p>
<p>get good at writing.</p>
<p>You had that kind of introspective moment of thinking,</p>
<p>this actually brings me a lot of joy and fulfillment.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it gets complicated</p>
<p>because I wrote a whole book</p>
<p>about following your passion being bad advice,</p>
<p>which is like the first thing I kind of got infamous for.</p>
<p>I wrote that back in 2012.</p>
<p>But the argument there is like passion cultivates, right?</p>
<p>So what I was pushing back on was the myth</p>
<p>that the passion for what you do exists full intensity</p>
<p>before you start, and then that&rsquo;s what propels you.</p>
<p>Or actually the reality is as you get better at something,</p>
<p>as you gain more autonomy, more skill and more impact,</p>
<p>the passion grows along with it.</p>
<p>So that when people look back later and say,</p>
<p>oh, follow your passion, what they really mean is</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very passionate about what I do,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a worthy goal.</p>
<p>But how you actually cultivate that is much more complicated</p>
<p>than just introspection is gonna identify,</p>
<p>like for sure you should be a writer or something like this.</p>
<p>So I was actually quoting you.</p>
<p>I was on a social network last night in a clubhouse.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve heard of it.</p>
<p>Wait, I have to ask you about this</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m invited to do a clubhouse.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that means.</p>
<p>A tech reporter has invited me to do a clubhouse</p>
<p>about my new book.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Well, let me know when, because I&rsquo;ll show up.</p>
<p>But what is it?</p>
<p>Okay, so first of all, let me just mention</p>
<p>that I was in a clubhouse room last night,</p>
<p>and I kept plugging exactly what you said about passion.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll talk about it.</p>
<p>It was a room that was focused on burnout.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But first, clubhouse is a kind of fascinating place</p>
<p>in terms of your mind would be very interesting</p>
<p>to analyze this place because we talk about email,</p>
<p>talk about social networks,</p>
<p>but clubhouse is something very different.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve encountered it in other places,</p>
<p>Discord and so on, that&rsquo;s voice only communication.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a bunch of people in a room.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just, their eyes closed.</p>
<p>All you hear is their voices.</p>
<p>In real time.</p>
<p>Real time, live.</p>
<p>It only happens live.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re technically not allowed to record,</p>
<p>but some people still do,</p>
<p>and especially when it&rsquo;s big conversations.</p>
<p>But the whole point is it&rsquo;s there live.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s different structures.</p>
<p>Like on Discord, it was so fascinating.</p>
<p>I have this Discord server</p>
<p>that would have hundreds of people in a room together, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all just little icons that can mute and unmute our mics.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re sitting there, so it&rsquo;s just voices,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re able with hundreds of people</p>
<p>to not interrupt each other.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, like as a dynamic system, like.</p>
<p>You see icons just like mics muted or not muted basically.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, so everyone&rsquo;s muted and they unmute</p>
<p>and it starts flashing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, so you&rsquo;re like, okay, let me get precedence.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the digital equivalent</p>
<p>of when you&rsquo;re in a conversation, like at a faculty meeting,</p>
<p>and you sort of like kind of make some noises,</p>
<p>like while the other person&rsquo;s finishing.</p>
<p>And so people realize like, okay,</p>
<p>this person wants to talk next,</p>
<p>but now it&rsquo;s purely digital.</p>
<p>You see a flashing.</p>
<p>But in a faculty meeting, which is very interesting,</p>
<p>like even as we&rsquo;re talking now,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a visual element that seems to increase</p>
<p>the probability of interruption.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just darkness.</p>
<p>You actually listen better and you don&rsquo;t interrupt.</p>
<p>So like if you create a culture,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always gonna be assholes,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re actually exceptions.</p>
<p>Everybody adjusts.</p>
<p>They kind of evolve to the beat of the room.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s one fascinating aspect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, that&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s different than like a Zoom call</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s video.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just audio.</p>
<p>You think video adds, but actually seems like it subtracts.</p>
<p>The second aspect of it that&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>is when it&rsquo;s no video, just audio, there&rsquo;s an intimacy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>Because with strangers, you connect in a much more real way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s similar to podcasts.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But with a lot of people.</p>
<p>With a lot of people and new people.</p>
<p>And they bring, okay, first of all,</p>
<p>different voices, like low voices and like high voices.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s more difficult to judge.</p>
<p>In Discord, you couldn&rsquo;t even see the people.</p>
<p>It was a culture where you do funny profile pictures</p>
<p>as opposed to your actual face.</p>
<p>In clubhouse, it&rsquo;s your actual face.</p>
<p>So you can tell like as an older person, younger person.</p>
<p>In Discord, you couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You just have to judge based on the voice.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something about the listening</p>
<p>and the intimacy of being surprised</p>
<p>by different strangers that feels almost</p>
<p>like a party with friends.</p>
<p>And friends of friends you haven&rsquo;t met yet,</p>
<p>but you really like.</p>
<p>Now clubhouse also has an interesting innovation</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a large crowd that just listens</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a stage.</p>
<p>And you can bring people up onto stage.</p>
<p>So only people on stage are talking.</p>
<p>And you can have like five, six, seven, eight,</p>
<p>sometimes 20, 30 people on stage.</p>
<p>And then you can also have thousands of people</p>
<p>just listening.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>a lot of people are being surprised by this.</p>
<p>Why is it called a social network?</p>
<p>It seems like it doesn&rsquo;t have, there&rsquo;s not social links.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a feed that&rsquo;s trying to harvest attention.</p>
<p>It feels like a communication.</p>
<p>So the social network aspect is you follow people.</p>
<p>And the people you follow,</p>
<p>now this is like the first social network</p>
<p>that is actually correct use of follow, I think.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re more likely to see the rooms they&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a, your feed is a bunch of rooms</p>
<p>that are going on right now.</p>
<p>And the people you follow are the ones</p>
<p>that will increase the likelihood</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll see the room they&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>And so the final result is like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a list of really interesting rooms.</p>
<p>Like I have all these, I&rsquo;ve been speaking Russian</p>
<p>quite a bit, there&rsquo;s practicing,</p>
<p>but also just like talking politics</p>
<p>and philosophy in Russian.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never done that before,</p>
<p>but it allows me to connect with that community.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a community of people,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s funny, but like I&rsquo;ll go in a community</p>
<p>of all African American people talking about race</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll be welcomed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never had, like I&rsquo;ve literally never been</p>
<p>in a difficult conversation about race,</p>
<p>like with people from all over the place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like fascinating.</p>
<p>And then musicians, jazz musicians, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You could say that a lot of other places</p>
<p>could have created that culture, I suppose.</p>
<p>Twitter and Facebook a lot for that culture,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something about this network</p>
<p>as it stands now, cause no Android users.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably just because it&rsquo;s iPhone people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>Less conspiratorial or something.</p>
<p>Well, like less, listen, I&rsquo;m an Android person.</p>
<p>So I got an iPhone just for this network, which is funny.</p>
<p>For now it&rsquo;s all like, there&rsquo;s very few trolls.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very few people that are trying</p>
<p>to manipulate the system and so on.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Now the downside, the reason you&rsquo;re going to hate it</p>
<p>is because it&rsquo;s so intimate, because it pulls you in</p>
<p>and pulls in very successful people like you,</p>
<p>just like really successful, productive, very busy people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge time sink.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to pull yourself out.</p>
<p>Interesting, you mean once you&rsquo;re in a room?</p>
<p>Well, no, leaving the room is actually easy.</p>
<p>The beautiful thing about a stage with multiple people,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little button that says leave quietly.</p>
<p>So culture, no etiquette wise, it&rsquo;s okay to just leave.</p>
<p>So you and I in a room, when it&rsquo;s just you and I,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little awkward to leave.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re asking questions, I&rsquo;m just gone.</p>
<p>But, and actually if you&rsquo;re being interviewed for the book,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s weird because you&rsquo;re now in the event</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re supposed to, but usually the person interviewing</p>
<p>would be like, okay, it&rsquo;s time for you to go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more normal, but the normal way to use the room</p>
<p>was like, you&rsquo;re just opening the app</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;ll be like, I don&rsquo;t know, Sam Harris,</p>
<p>Eric Weinstein, I think Joe Rogan showed up to the app,</p>
<p>Bill Gates, these people on stage</p>
<p>just like randomly just plugged in</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ll step up on stage,</p>
<p>listen, maybe you won&rsquo;t contribute at all,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;ll say something funny</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ll just leave.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s the addicting aspect to it.</p>
<p>The reason it&rsquo;s a time sink is you don&rsquo;t wanna leave.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve noticed about exceptionally busy people</p>
<p>that they love this.</p>
<p>I think it might have to do with the pandemic.</p>
<p>It might be a little bit, yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a loneliness.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all starved, yeah.</p>
<p>But also it&rsquo;s really cool people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like when was the last time you talked to Sam Harris</p>
<p>or whoever, like think of anybody,</p>
<p>Tyler Copeland, like any faculty.</p>
<p>This is like what universities strive to create,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s taken hundreds of years of cultural evolution</p>
<p>to try to get a lot of interesting, smart people together</p>
<p>that run into each other.</p>
<p>We have really strong faculty in a room together</p>
<p>with no scheduling.</p>
<p>This is the power of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you just show up,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s none of that baggage of scheduling and so on</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no pressure to leave, sorry,</p>
<p>no pressure to stay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy for you to leave.</p>
<p>You realize that there&rsquo;s a lot of constraints on meetings</p>
<p>and like faculty, like even stopping by before the pandemic,</p>
<p>a friend or faculty or colleague and so on,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a weirdness about leaving.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But here there&rsquo;s not a weirdness about leaving.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve discovered something interesting.</p>
<p>But the final result when you observe it</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s very fulfilling.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very beneficial, but it&rsquo;s very addicting.</p>
<p>So you have to make sure you moderate.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Okay, well, so maybe I&rsquo;ll try it.</p>
<p>I mean, look, there&rsquo;s no,</p>
<p>the things that make me suspicious</p>
<p>about other platforms aren&rsquo;t here.</p>
<p>So the feed is not full of user generated content</p>
<p>that is going through some sort of algorithmic rating process</p>
<p>with all the weird incentives and nudging that does.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not producing content that&rsquo;s being harvested</p>
<p>to be monetized by another company.</p>
<p>I mean, it seems like it&rsquo;s more ephemeral, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re here, you&rsquo;re talking.</p>
<p>The feed is just actually just showing you</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s interesting things happening, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not jockeying in the feed for,</p>
<p>look, I&rsquo;m being clever or something</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna get a light count that goes up</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s gonna influence.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s more friction.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more cognitive friction, I guess,</p>
<p>involved in listening to smart people</p>
<p>versus scrolling through.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s something there.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no.</p>
<p>Why are people so, I see all,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all these articles that seem,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t really read them.</p>
<p>Why are reporters negative about this?</p>
<p>Competition.</p>
<p>The New York Times wrote this article called</p>
<p>Unfettered Conversations Happening on Clubhouse is.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m right in picking up a tone</p>
<p>even from the headlines</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s some like negative vibes from the press.</p>
<p>No, so I can say, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;ll tell you what the article was saying,</p>
<p>which is they&rsquo;re having cancellable conversations,</p>
<p>like the biggest people in the world</p>
<p>almost trolling the press.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And the press is desperately.</p>
<p>Like foreshanning the press.</p>
<p>Yeah, foreshanning the press.</p>
<p>By saying that you guys are looking for click bait</p>
<p>from our genuine human conversations.</p>
<p>And so I think the, honestly,</p>
<p>the press is just like, what do we do with this?</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t, first of all, it&rsquo;s a lot of work for them.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what Naval says, which is like,</p>
<p>this is skipping the journalist.</p>
<p>Like the interview you, if you go on Clubhouse,</p>
<p>the interview you might do for the book</p>
<p>will be with somebody who&rsquo;s like a journalist</p>
<p>and interviewing you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more traditional.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be a good introduction for you to try it.</p>
<p>But like the way to use Clubhouse is you just show up</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, again, like me, I&rsquo;m sorry,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, boy, I keep mentioning Sam Harris</p>
<p>as if it&rsquo;s like the only person I know,</p>
<p>but like a lot of these major faculty,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, Max Tegmark.</p>
<p>Like just major faculty just sitting there</p>
<p>and then you show up and then I&rsquo;ll ask like,</p>
<p>oh, don&rsquo;t you have a book coming out or something?</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ll talk about the book</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ll leave five minutes later</p>
<p>because you have to go get coffee included.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So like that&rsquo;s the, it&rsquo;s not the journalistic,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna actually enjoy the interview as much</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;ll be like the normal thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re there 40 minutes or an hour</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;ll be questions from the audience.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m doing an event next week for the book launch</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like Jason Fried and I are talking about email,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s using some more like a thousand people</p>
<p>who are there to watch virtually,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s using some sort of traditional webinar.</p>
<p>Clubhouse would be a situation</p>
<p>where that could just happen informally.</p>
<p>Like I jump in like Jason&rsquo;s there</p>
<p>and then someone else jumps in and yeah, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>But for now it&rsquo;s still closed.</p>
<p>So even though there&rsquo;s a lot of excitement</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;ll be quite famous people</p>
<p>just sitting there listening to you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But the numbers aren&rsquo;t exactly high.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re talking about rooms,</p>
<p>like even the huge rooms are like just a few thousand.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And this is probably like Soho in the 50s or something too.</p>
<p>Just because of the exponential growth,</p>
<p>give it seven more months.</p>
<p>And if you let one invite be, it gets two invites,</p>
<p>it gets four invites,</p>
<p>because pretty soon it&rsquo;ll be everyone.</p>
<p>And then the rooms in your feed are gonna be whatever,</p>
<p>marketing, performance enhancing drugs or something like that.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But then in a bunch of competitors,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s already like 30 plus competitors sprung up,</p>
<p>Twitter spaces.</p>
<p>So Twitter is creating a competitor</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to likely destroy Clubhouse</p>
<p>because they just have a much larger user base</p>
<p>and they already have a social network.</p>
<p>So I would be very cautious, of course,</p>
<p>with the addictive element,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t just like you said,</p>
<p>this particular implementation in its early stages</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have the like,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have the context switching problem.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll just switch to it and you&rsquo;ll be stuck.</p>
<p>Yeah, to keep a context is great.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>But then I think the best way I&rsquo;ve found to use it</p>
<p>is to acknowledge that these things pull you in.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve used it in the past,</p>
<p>like almost, I&rsquo;ll go get a coffee</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll tune into a conversation</p>
<p>as if that&rsquo;s how I use podcasts sometimes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just like play a little bit of a podcast</p>
<p>and then I can just turn it off.</p>
<p>The problem with these is it pulls you in,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>And then the other problem that you&rsquo;ll experience</p>
<p>is like somebody will recognize you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;ll be like, oh, Lex.</p>
<p>Come on up.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Oh, hey, I had a question for you.</p>
<p>And then it takes a lot for you to go like,</p>
<p>to ignore that.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>So. Yeah.</p>
<p>And then you pulled in and it&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really cool people.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like a source of a lot of joy,</p>
<p>but you have to be very, very careful.</p>
<p>The reason I brought it up is we,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a room, there&rsquo;s an entire club actually on burnout.</p>
<p>And I brought you up and I brought David Goggins</p>
<p>as the process I go through, which is,</p>
<p>my passion goes up and down, it dips.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think I trust my own mind</p>
<p>to tell me whether I&rsquo;m getting close to burnout</p>
<p>or exhaustion or not.</p>
<p>I kind of go with the David Goggins model of,</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s probably more applying it to running,</p>
<p>but when it feels like your mind can&rsquo;t take any more,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re just 40% at your capacity.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just like an arbitrary level.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Navy SEAL thing, right?</p>
<p>The Navy SEAL thing.</p>
<p>I mean, you could put that at any percent,</p>
<p>but it is remarkable that if you just take it</p>
<p>one step at a time, just keep going,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s similar to this idea of a process.</p>
<p>If you just trust the process and you just keep following,</p>
<p>even if the passion goes up and down and so on,</p>
<p>then ultimately, if you look in aggregate,</p>
<p>the passion will increase.</p>
<p>Your self satisfaction will increase.</p>
<p>And if you have two things,</p>
<p>this has been a big strategy of mine,</p>
<p>so that what you hope for is off phase, off phase alignment.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s in phase and that&rsquo;s a problem,</p>
<p>but off phase alignment&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>So, okay, my research, I&rsquo;m struggling,</p>
<p>but my book stuff is going well, right?</p>
<p>And so when you add those two waves together,</p>
<p>like, oh, we&rsquo;re doing pretty well.</p>
<p>And then in other periods, like on my writing,</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m just not getting anywhere,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve had some good papers, I&rsquo;m feeling good over there.</p>
<p>So having two things that can counteract each other.</p>
<p>Now, sometimes they fall into sync and then it gets rough.</p>
<p>Then when, you know, when everything,</p>
<p>because everything for me is cyclical,</p>
<p>good periods, bad periods with all this stuff.</p>
<p>So typically they don&rsquo;t coincide, so it helps compensate.</p>
<p>When they do coincide, you get really high highs,</p>
<p>like where everything&rsquo;s clicking,</p>
<p>and then you get these really low lows</p>
<p>where like your research is not working,</p>
<p>your program&rsquo;s not clicking,</p>
<p>you feel like you&rsquo;re nowhere with your writing,</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s a little rougher.</p>
<p>Is, do you think about the concept of burnout?</p>
<p>Because I personally have never experienced burnout</p>
<p>in the way that folks talk about,</p>
<p>which is like, it&rsquo;s not just the up and down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you don&rsquo;t want to do anything ever again.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, for some people it&rsquo;s like physical,</p>
<p>like to the hospital kind of thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I do worry about it.</p>
<p>So when I used to do student writing,</p>
<p>like writing about students and student advice,</p>
<p>it came up a lot with students at elite schools,</p>
<p>and I used to call it deep procrastination,</p>
<p>but it was a real, really vivid, very replicatable syndrome</p>
<p>where they stop being able to do schoolwork.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like this is due, and the professor gives you an extension,</p>
<p>and the professor gives you an incomplete,</p>
<p>and says, you got it, you were gonna fail the course,</p>
<p>you have to hand this in, and they can&rsquo;t do it, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a complete stop</p>
<p>on the ability to actually do work.</p>
<p>And so I used to counsel students who had that issue,</p>
<p>and often it was a combination of,</p>
<p>this is my best analysis,</p>
<p>is you have just the physical and cognitive difficulties</p>
<p>of they&rsquo;re usually under a very hard load, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing too many majors, too many extracurriculars,</p>
<p>just really pushing themselves,</p>
<p>and the motivation is not sufficiently intrinsic.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So if you have a motivational center</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not completely on board,</p>
<p>so a lot of these kids, like when I&rsquo;m dealing with MIT kids,</p>
<p>they would be, their whole town was shooting off fireworks</p>
<p>that they got in.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s hoped that they were going there,</p>
<p>and that they&rsquo;re in three majors,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t wanna let people down,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not really interested</p>
<p>in being a doctor or whatever.</p>
<p>So your motivation&rsquo;s not in the right place.</p>
<p>The motivational psychologist would say</p>
<p>the locus of control was more towards</p>
<p>the extrinsic end of the spectrum, and you have hardship.</p>
<p>And you could just fritz out the whole system.</p>
<p>And so I would always be very worried about that.</p>
<p>So I think about that a lot.</p>
<p>I do a lot of multi phase or multi scale seasonality.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll go hard on something for a while,</p>
<p>and then for a few weeks, go easy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have semesters that are hard,</p>
<p>and semesters that are easy.</p>
<p>Or I&rsquo;ll take the summer really low.</p>
<p>So on multiple scales,</p>
<p>and in the day I&rsquo;ll go really hard on something,</p>
<p>but then have a hard cut off at five.</p>
<p>So like every scale, it&rsquo;s all about rest and recovery.</p>
<p>Because I really wanna avoid that.</p>
<p>And I do burn out.</p>
<p>I burnt out, pretty recently I get minor burnt outs.</p>
<p>I got a couple papers that I was trying to work through</p>
<p>for a deadline a few weeks ago,</p>
<p>and I wasn&rsquo;t sleeping well,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some other things going on.</p>
<p>And it just knocks out and I get sick usually,</p>
<p>is how I know I&rsquo;ve pushed myself too far.</p>
<p>And so I kind of pulled it back.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m doing this book launch.</p>
<p>Then after this book launch, I&rsquo;m pulling it back again.</p>
<p>So I like seasonality for rest and recovery,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s crucial.</p>
<p>And at every scale, daily, monthly,</p>
<p>and then at the annual scale.</p>
<p>An easy summer, for example,</p>
<p>I think is like a great idea if that&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Okay, you just made me realize</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s exactly what I do.</p>
<p>Because I feel like I&rsquo;m not even close</p>
<p>to burnout or anything.</p>
<p>Even though I&rsquo;m in chaos,</p>
<p>I feel the right exact way is the seasonality,</p>
<p>is the, not even the seasonality,</p>
<p>but like you always have multiple seasons operating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you said,</p>
<p>because when you have a lot of cool shit going on,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always at least one thing that&rsquo;s a source of joy,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s always a reason.</p>
<p>I suppose the fundamental thing,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve known people that suffer from depression too,</p>
<p>the fundamental problem with the experience of depression</p>
<p>and burnout is why do, life is meaningless.</p>
<p>And I always have an answer of why today could be cool.</p>
<p>And you have to contrive it, right?</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have it, you have to contrive it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>Like, okay, well, this is going bad,</p>
<p>so now is the time to start thinking about,</p>
<p>I mean, look, I started a podcast during the pandemic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, this is going pretty bad, but you know what?</p>
<p>This could be something really interesting.</p>
<p>Deep questions with Kyle Newport.</p>
<p>I do it all in that voice.</p>
<p>I love the podcast, by the way.</p>
<p>But yeah, I think David Foster Wallace said,</p>
<p>the key to life is to be unboreable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always kind of taken that to heart,</p>
<p>which is like, you should be able to maybe artificially</p>
<p>generate anything.</p>
<p>Like, find something in your environment,</p>
<p>in your surroundings, that&rsquo;s a source of joy.</p>
<p>Like, everything is fun.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Did you read The Pale King?</p>
<p>It goes deep on boredom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like uncomfortable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like an uncomfortable meditation on boredom.</p>
<p>Like, the characters in that are just driven</p>
<p>to the extremes of, I just bought three books on boredom</p>
<p>the other day, so now I&rsquo;m really interested in this topic.</p>
<p>Because I was anxious about my book launch</p>
<p>happening this week.</p>
<p>So I was like, okay, I need something else.</p>
<p>So I have this idea for, I might do it as an article first,</p>
<p>but as a book.</p>
<p>Like, okay, I need something cool to be thinking about.</p>
<p>Because I was worried about, like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if the launch&rsquo;s gonna work, the pandemic,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s gonna happen, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s gonna get there.</p>
<p>So this is exactly what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>So I went out and I bought a bunch of books,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m beginning like a whole intellectual exploration.</p>
<p>Well, I think that&rsquo;s one of the profound ideas</p>
<p>in deep work that you don&rsquo;t expand on too much</p>
<p>is boredom.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, so deep work had a superficial idea</p>
<p>about boredom, which was,</p>
<p>I had this chapter called Embrace Boredom,</p>
<p>and a very functionalist idea was basically,</p>
<p>you have to have some boredom in your regular schedule,</p>
<p>or your mind is gonna form a Pavlovian connection</p>
<p>between as soon as I feel boredom, I get stimuli.</p>
<p>And once it forms that connection,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s never gonna tolerate deep work.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this very pragmatic treatment of boredom</p>
<p>of your mind better be used to the idea</p>
<p>that sometimes you don&rsquo;t get stimuli</p>
<p>because otherwise you can&rsquo;t write for three hours,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s just not gonna tolerate it.</p>
<p>But more recently, what I&rsquo;m really interested in boredom</p>
<p>is it as a fundamental human drive, right?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s incredibly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>And think about the other things</p>
<p>that are incredibly uncomfortable, like hunger or thirst,</p>
<p>they serve a really important purpose for a species, right?</p>
<p>Like if something is really distressing, there&rsquo;s a reason.</p>
<p>Pain is really uncomfortable</p>
<p>because we need to worry about getting injured.</p>
<p>Thirst is really uncomfortable</p>
<p>because we need water to survive.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s boredom?</p>
<p>Why is that uncomfortable?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been interested in this notion</p>
<p>that boredom is about driving us towards productive action.</p>
<p>Like as a species, I mean, think about it,</p>
<p>like what got us to actually take advantage of these brains?</p>
<p>What got us to actually work with fire?</p>
<p>What got us to start shaping stones and the hand axes</p>
<p>and figuring out if we could actually sharpen a stick</p>
<p>sharp enough that we could throw it as a melee weapon</p>
<p>or a distance weapon for hunting mammoth, right?</p>
<p>Boredom drives us towards action.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m fascinated by this fundamental action instinct</p>
<p>because I have this theory that I&rsquo;m working on</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re out of sync with it.</p>
<p>Just like we have this drive for hunger,</p>
<p>but then we introduced junk food</p>
<p>and got out of sync with hunger</p>
<p>and it makes us really unhealthy.</p>
<p>We have this drive towards action,</p>
<p>but then we overload ourselves</p>
<p>and we have all of these distractions.</p>
<p>And then that causes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a cognitive action obesity type things</p>
<p>because it short circuits this system</p>
<p>that wants us to do things,</p>
<p>but we put more things on our plate than we can possibly do</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re really frustrated we can&rsquo;t do them</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re short circuiting all of our wires.</p>
<p>So it all comes back to this question,</p>
<p>well, what would be the ideal sort of amount of stuff</p>
<p>to do and type of things to do?</p>
<p>Like if we wanted to look back at our ancestral environment</p>
<p>and say, if I could just build from scratch,</p>
<p>how much work I do and what I work on</p>
<p>to be as in touch with that as like paleo people</p>
<p>are trying to get their diets in touch with that.</p>
<p>And so now I&rsquo;m just, well, see, this is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something I made up,</p>
<p>but now I&rsquo;m going deep on it.</p>
<p>And one of my podcast listeners I was talking about</p>
<p>on the show and I was like,</p>
<p>well, I get trying to learn about animals and boredom.</p>
<p>And she sent me this cool article</p>
<p>from an animal behaviorist journal</p>
<p>about what we know about human boredom versus animal boredom.</p>
<p>So trying to figure out that puzzle</p>
<p>is the wave that&rsquo;s high.</p>
<p>So I can get through the wave that&rsquo;s low of like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about this pandemic book launch.</p>
<p>And my research is stumbling a little bit</p>
<p>because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>And so I needed a nice, you know, high.</p>
<p>So there we go, there&rsquo;s a case study.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s both a case study</p>
<p>and a very interesting set of concepts</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t even realize that it&rsquo;s so simple.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of the people</p>
<p>that has a interesting push and pull dynamic with hunger,</p>
<p>trying to understand the hunger with myself.</p>
<p>Like I probably have an unhealthy relationship with food.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but there&rsquo;s probably a perfect,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a nice way to think about diet as action.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably an optimal diet response</p>
<p>to the experience that our body&rsquo;s telling us,</p>
<p>the signal that our body&rsquo;s sending, which is hunger.</p>
<p>And in that same way, boredom is sending a signal.</p>
<p>And most of our intellectual activities in this world,</p>
<p>our creative activities,</p>
<p>are essentially a response to that signal.</p>
<p>Yeah, and think about this analogy</p>
<p>that we have this hunger instinct</p>
<p>that junk food short circuits, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, we&rsquo;ll satisfy that hyper palatably</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t end up well.</p>
<p>Now think about modern attention engineered,</p>
<p>digitally mediated entertainment.</p>
<p>We have this boredom instinct.</p>
<p>Oh, we can take care of that</p>
<p>with a hyper palatable alternative.</p>
<p>Is that gonna lead to a similar problem?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been fasting a lot lately,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m doing eating once a day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing that for over a month,</p>
<p>just eating one meal a day and primarily meat.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very, fasting has been incredible for me,</p>
<p>for focus, for wellbeing, for, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>just for feeling good, okay?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll put on a chart what makes me feel good.</p>
<p>And that fasting and eating primarily a meat based diet</p>
<p>makes me feel really good.</p>
<p>And so, but that ultimately what fasting did,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t fasted super long yet,</p>
<p>like a seven day diet, which I really like to do.</p>
<p>But even just fasting for a day for 24 hours</p>
<p>gets you in touch with your, with the signal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Like you get to listen to your,</p>
<p>learn to listen to your body that like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s okay to be hungry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a little signal that sends you stuff.</p>
<p>And then I get to listen to how it responds</p>
<p>when I put food in my body.</p>
<p>Like, and I get to like, okay, cool.</p>
<p>So like food is a thing that pacifies the signal.</p>
<p>Like it sounds ridiculous, okay?</p>
<p>And you could do that with.</p>
<p>And do different types of food.</p>
<p>It feels different.</p>
<p>So you learn about what your body wants.</p>
<p>For some reason fasting,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s similar to the deep work, embrace boredom.</p>
<p>Fasting allowed me to go into mode of listening,</p>
<p>of trying to understand the signal that I could say,</p>
<p>I have an unhealthy appreciation of fruit, okay?</p>
<p>I love apples and cherries.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know how to moderate them.</p>
<p>So if you take just same amount of calories,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know calories matter, but they say calories.</p>
<p>2000 calories of cherries versus 2000 calories of steak.</p>
<p>If I eat 2000 calories of steak,</p>
<p>maybe just a little bit of like green beans or cauliflower,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to feel really good, fulfilled, focused and happy.</p>
<p>If I eat cherries, I&rsquo;m going to be,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to wake up behind a dumpster crying with like naked</p>
<p>and like, it&rsquo;s just.</p>
<p>Pits all around.</p>
<p>Yeah, with everything.</p>
<p>Over your face, yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like bloated, just not and unhappy.</p>
<p>And also the mood swings up and down.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll be much hungrier the next day.</p>
<p>Sometimes it takes a couple of days.</p>
<p>But when I introduce carbs into the system, too many carbs,</p>
<p>it starts, it&rsquo;s just unhealthy.</p>
<p>I go into this roller coaster as opposed to a calm boat ride</p>
<p>along the river in the Amazon or something like that.</p>
<p>And so fasting was the mechanism for me</p>
<p>to start listening to the body.</p>
<p>I wonder if you can do that same kind of,</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s what meditation a little bit is.</p>
<p>A little bit, but yeah, listen to boredom.</p>
<p>But so two years ago,</p>
<p>I had a book out called Digital Minimalism.</p>
<p>And one of the things I was recommending that people do</p>
<p>is basically a 30 day fast.</p>
<p>But from digital personal entertainment,</p>
<p>social media, online videos,</p>
<p>anything that captures your attention and dispels boredom.</p>
<p>And people were thinking like, oh, this is a detox.</p>
<p>Like, I just wanna teach your body</p>
<p>not to need the distraction, this or that.</p>
<p>But it really wasn&rsquo;t what I was interested in.</p>
<p>I wanted there to be space</p>
<p>that you could listen to your boredom.</p>
<p>Like, okay, I can&rsquo;t just dispel it.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t just look at the screen</p>
<p>and revel in it a little bit and start to listen to it</p>
<p>and say, what is this really pushing me towards?</p>
<p>And you take the new stuff, the new technology off the table</p>
<p>and sort of ask, what is this?</p>
<p>What am I craving?</p>
<p>Like, what&rsquo;s the activity equivalent of 2000 calories</p>
<p>of meat with a little bit of green beans on the side?</p>
<p>And I had 1700 people go through this experiment,</p>
<p>like spend 30 days doing this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard at first,</p>
<p>but then they get used to listening to themselves</p>
<p>and sort of seeking out,</p>
<p>what is this really pushing me towards?</p>
<p>And it was pushing people towards connection.</p>
<p>It was pushing people towards,</p>
<p>I just wanna go be around other people.</p>
<p>It was pushing people towards high quality</p>
<p>leisure activities.</p>
<p>Like I wanna go do something that&rsquo;s complicated.</p>
<p>And it took weeks sometimes for them</p>
<p>to get in touch with their boredom,</p>
<p>but then it completely rewired how they thought about,</p>
<p>what do I wanna do with my time outside of work?</p>
<p>And then the idea is when you&rsquo;re done with that,</p>
<p>then it was much easier to go back</p>
<p>and completely change your digital life</p>
<p>because you have alternatives, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not just trying to abstain from things you don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s basically a listening to boredom experiment.</p>
<p>Like just be there with the boredom</p>
<p>and see where it drives you</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t have the digital Cheez Its.</p>
<p>Okay, so if I can&rsquo;t do that,</p>
<p>where is it gonna drive me?</p>
<p>Well, I guess I kinda wanna go to the library,</p>
<p>which came up a lot, by the way,</p>
<p>a lot of people rediscovered the library.</p>
<p>With physical books.</p>
<p>Physical books, so like you can just go borrow them.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s like low pressure and you can explore</p>
<p>and you bring them home and then you read them</p>
<p>and you can like sit by the window and read them</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s nice weather outside.</p>
<p>And I used to do that 20 years ago,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re listening to boredom.</p>
<p>So can you maybe elaborate a little bit</p>
<p>on the different experiences that people had</p>
<p>when they quit social media for 30 days?</p>
<p>Like if you were to recommend that process,</p>
<p>what is ultimately the goal?</p>
<p>Yeah, digital minimalism,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my philosophy for all this tech.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s working backwards from what&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s you figure out what you&rsquo;re actually all about,</p>
<p>like what you wanna do,</p>
<p>what you wanna spend your time doing.</p>
<p>And then you can ask, okay,</p>
<p>is there a place that tech could amplify</p>
<p>or support some of these things?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how you decide what tech to use.</p>
<p>And so the process is,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s actually get away from everything,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s be bored for a while,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s really spend a month getting really figuring out</p>
<p>what do I actually wanna do?</p>
<p>What do I wanna spend my time doing?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s important to me?</p>
<p>What makes me feel good?</p>
<p>And then when you&rsquo;re done,</p>
<p>you can bring back in tech very strategically</p>
<p>to help those things, right?</p>
<p>And that was the goal.</p>
<p>That turns out to be much more successful</p>
<p>than when people take a abstention only approach.</p>
<p>So if you come out your tech life and say,</p>
<p>you know, whatever, I look at Instagram too much.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t like how much I&rsquo;m on Instagram,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a bad thing.</p>
<p>I wanna reduce this bad thing.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s my new thing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna spend less time looking at Instagram,</p>
<p>much less likely to succeed in the longterm.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re much less likely at trying to reduce</p>
<p>this sort of amorphous negative</p>
<p>because in the moment you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>yeah, but it&rsquo;s not that bad</p>
<p>and it would be kind of interesting to look at it now.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re instead controlling behavior</p>
<p>because you have a positive that you&rsquo;re aiming towards,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very powerful for people.</p>
<p>Like I want my life to be like this,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the role that tech plays in that life.</p>
<p>The connection to wanting your life to be like that</p>
<p>is very, very strong.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s much, much easier to say,</p>
<p>yeah, like using Instagram is not part of my plan</p>
<p>for how I have that life.</p>
<p>And I really wanna have that life,</p>
<p>so of course I&rsquo;m not gonna use Instagram.</p>
<p>So it turns out to be a much more sustainable way</p>
<p>to tame what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>So if you quit social media for 30 days,</p>
<p>you kinda have to do the work.</p>
<p>You have to do the work.</p>
<p>Of thinking like, what am I actually,</p>
<p>what makes me happy in terms of these tools</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve previously used</p>
<p>and when you try to integrate them back,</p>
<p>how can I integrate them to maximize</p>
<p>the thing that actually makes me happy?</p>
<p>Yeah, or what makes me happy unrelated to technology?</p>
<p>Like what do I actually, what do I want my life to be like?</p>
<p>Well, maybe what I wanna do is be like outside of nature</p>
<p>two hours a day and spend a lot more time</p>
<p>like helping my community and sacrificing</p>
<p>on behalf of my connections</p>
<p>and then have some sort of intellectually engaging</p>
<p>leisure activity like I&rsquo;m reading</p>
<p>or trying to read the great books</p>
<p>and having more calm and seeing the sunset.</p>
<p>Like you create this picture and then you go back</p>
<p>and say, well, I still need my Facebook group</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s how I keep up with my cycling group.</p>
<p>But Twitter is just, you know,</p>
<p>toxic, it&rsquo;s not helping any of these things.</p>
<p>And well, I&rsquo;m an artist,</p>
<p>so I kinda need Instagram to get inspiration.</p>
<p>But if I know that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m using Instagram,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need it on my phone, it&rsquo;s just on my computer</p>
<p>and I just follow 10 artists and check it once a week.</p>
<p>Like you really can start deploying.</p>
<p>It was the number one thing</p>
<p>that differentiated in that experiment,</p>
<p>the people who ended up sustainably making changes</p>
<p>and getting through the 30 days and those who didn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>was the people who did the experimentation</p>
<p>and the reflection.</p>
<p>Like let me try to figure out what&rsquo;s positive.</p>
<p>They were much more successful than the people</p>
<p>that just said, I&rsquo;m sick of using my phone so much.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just gonna white knuckle it.</p>
<p>Just 30 days will be good for me.</p>
<p>I just gotta get away from it or something.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t last.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t use social media currently.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you find that a lot of people going through this process</p>
<p>will seek to basically arrive at a similar place</p>
<p>to not use social media primarily?</p>
<p>About half.</p>
<p>Right, so about half when they went through this exercise,</p>
<p>and these aren&rsquo;t quantified numbers.</p>
<p>This is just, they sent me reports and yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty good though, 1700?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So roughly half probably got rid of social media altogether.</p>
<p>Once they did this exercise,</p>
<p>they realized these things I care about,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, social media&rsquo;s not the tools that&rsquo;s really helping.</p>
<p>The other half kept some,</p>
<p>there were some things in their life</p>
<p>where some social media was useful.</p>
<p>But the key thing is if they knew</p>
<p>why they were deploying social media,</p>
<p>they could put fences around it.</p>
<p>So for example, of those half that kept some social media,</p>
<p>almost none of them kept it on their phone.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can&rsquo;t optimize if you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what the function you&rsquo;re trying to optimize.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like this huge hack.</p>
<p>Like once you know this is why I&rsquo;m using Twitter,</p>
<p>then you can have a lot of rules about how you use Twitter.</p>
<p>And suddenly you take this cost benefit ratio</p>
<p>and it goes like way from the company&rsquo;s advantage</p>
<p>and then way over towards your advantage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of fascinating</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been torn with social media,</p>
<p>but I did this kind of process.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t actually done it for 30 days,</p>
<p>which I probably should.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do it for like a week at a time and regularly</p>
<p>and thinking what kind of approach to Twitter works for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m distinctly aware of the fact</p>
<p>that I really enjoy posting once or twice a day.</p>
<p>And at that time checking from the previous post,</p>
<p>it makes me feel even when there&rsquo;s like negative comments,</p>
<p>they go right past me.</p>
<p>And when there&rsquo;s positive comments, it makes you smile.</p>
<p>I feel like love and connection with people,</p>
<p>especially with people I know,</p>
<p>but even just in general, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it makes me feel like the world is full of awesome people.</p>
<p>Okay, when you increase that from checking from two to like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the threshold is for me,</p>
<p>but probably like five or six per day,</p>
<p>it starts going to anxiety world.</p>
<p>Like where negative comments will actually stick</p>
<p>to me mentally and positive comments will feel more shallow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of fascinating.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been trying to, there&rsquo;s been long stretches of time,</p>
<p>I think December and January where I did just post</p>
<p>and check, post and check.</p>
<p>That makes me really happy.</p>
<p>Most of 2020 I did that, it made me really happy.</p>
<p>Recently I started like, I&rsquo;ll go,</p>
<p>you go right back in like a drug addict,</p>
<p>where you check it like, I don&rsquo;t know what that number is,</p>
<p>but that number is high.</p>
<p>Not good, you don&rsquo;t come out happy.</p>
<p>No one comes out of a day full of Twitter</p>
<p>celebrating humanity.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not even,</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;m very fortunate to have a lot of just</p>
<p>positivity in the Twitter,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s just a general anxiety.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t even say it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably the thing that you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>with the contact switching.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like an exhaustion.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t even say it&rsquo;s like a negative feeling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost just an exhaustion</p>
<p>to where I&rsquo;m not creating anything beautiful in my life,</p>
<p>just exhausted.</p>
<p>Like an existential exhaustion.</p>
<p>Existential exhaustion.</p>
<p>But I wonder, do you think it&rsquo;s possible to use</p>
<p>from the people you&rsquo;ve seen from yourself</p>
<p>to use social media in the way I&rsquo;m describing moderation?</p>
<p>Or is it always going to become?</p>
<p>When people do this exercise,</p>
<p>you get lots of configurations.</p>
<p>So for people that have a public presence, for example,</p>
<p>like what you&rsquo;re doing is not that unusual.</p>
<p>Okay, I post one thing a day and my audience likes it</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s kind of it.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ve thought through like, okay,</p>
<p>this supports something I value,</p>
<p>which is like having a sort of informal connection</p>
<p>with my audience and being exposed to some sort of</p>
<p>positive randomness.</p>
<p>Okay, then you could say if that&rsquo;s my goal,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the right way to do it?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t need to be on Twitter on my phone all day.</p>
<p>Maybe what I do is every day at five,</p>
<p>I do my post and check on the day.</p>
<p>So I have a writer friend, Ryan Holiday,</p>
<p>who writes about the Stoics a lot.</p>
<p>And he has this similar strategy.</p>
<p>He posts one quote every day usually from a famous Stoic</p>
<p>and sometimes from a contemporary figure.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just what he does.</p>
<p>He just posts it and it&rsquo;s a very positive thing.</p>
<p>Like his readers really love it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just like a dose of inspiration.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t spend time.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s never interacting with anyone on social media, right?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s an example of I figured out</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s important to me,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the best way to use tools to amplify it.</p>
<p>And then you get advantages out of the tools.</p>
<p>So I like what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>I looked you up, I looked up your Twitter feed</p>
<p>before I came over here.</p>
<p>I was curious, you&rsquo;re not on there a lot.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see you yelling at people.</p>
<p>Now, do you think social media as a medium</p>
<p>changed the cultural standards?</p>
<p>And I mean it in a, have you read Neil Postman at all?</p>
<p>Have you read like a Amusing Ourselves to Death?</p>
<p>He was a social critic, technology critic</p>
<p>and wrote a lot about sort of technological determinism.</p>
<p>So the ways, which is a really influential idea</p>
<p>to a lot of my work,</p>
<p>which is actually a little out of fashion</p>
<p>right now in academia.</p>
<p>But the ways that the properties</p>
<p>and presence of technologies change things about humans</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s not really intended</p>
<p>or planned by the humans themselves.</p>
<p>And that book is all about</p>
<p>how different communication medium,</p>
<p>like fundamentally just changed the way</p>
<p>the human brain understands and operates.</p>
<p>And so he sort of gets into the,</p>
<p>what happened when the printed word was widespread</p>
<p>and how television changed it.</p>
<p>And this was all pre social media.</p>
<p>But this is one of these ideas I&rsquo;m having</p>
<p>is like what&rsquo;s the degree to which,</p>
<p>and I get into it sometimes on my show,</p>
<p>I get into a little bit,</p>
<p>like the degree to which like Twitter in particular</p>
<p>just changed the way that people conceptualized</p>
<p>what for example, debate and discussion was.</p>
<p>Like it introduced a rhetorical dunk culture</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s sort of more about tribes</p>
<p>not giving ground to other tribes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s a complete,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s different places and times</p>
<p>when that type of discussion was thought of differently.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>But I tend to believe, I don&rsquo;t know what you think,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s the technological solutions.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s literally different features in Twitter</p>
<p>that could completely reverse that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much power in the different choices that are made.</p>
<p>And it could still be highly engaging</p>
<p>and have very different effects.</p>
<p>Perhaps more negative or hopefully more positive.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I&rsquo;m trying to pull these two things apart.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s these two ways social media,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say could change the experience</p>
<p>of reading a major newspaper today.</p>
<p>One could be a little bit more economic, right?</p>
<p>So the internet made it cheaper to get news.</p>
<p>The newspapers had to retreat to a paywall model</p>
<p>because it was the only way they were gonna survive.</p>
<p>But once you&rsquo;re in a paywall model,</p>
<p>then what you really wanna do is make your tribe,</p>
<p>which is within the paywall, very, very happy with you.</p>
<p>So you wanna work to them.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s the sort of determinist point of view,</p>
<p>which is the properties of Twitter, which were arbitrary.</p>
<p>Jack and Evan just, whatever, let&rsquo;s just do it this way.</p>
<p>Influenced the very way that people now understand</p>
<p>and think about the world.</p>
<p>So the one influenced the other, I think.</p>
<p>They kind of started adjusting together.</p>
<p>I did this thing, I mean, I&rsquo;m trying to understand this.</p>
<p>Part of the, I&rsquo;ve been playing with the entrepreneurial idea.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very particular dream I&rsquo;ve had of a startup.</p>
<p>That this is a longer term thing,</p>
<p>it has to do with artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>But more and more, it seems like there&rsquo;s some trajectory</p>
<p>through creating social media type of technologies.</p>
<p>Very different than what people are thinking I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a kind of challenge to the way the Twitter is done.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not obvious what the best mechanisms are</p>
<p>to still make an exceptionally engaging platform.</p>
<p>My clubhouse is very engaging.</p>
<p>And not have any other negative effects.</p>
<p>For example, there&rsquo;s Chrome extensions</p>
<p>that allow you to turn off all likes and dislikes</p>
<p>and all of that from Twitter.</p>
<p>So all you&rsquo;re seeing is just the content.</p>
<p>On Twitter, that to me creates,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a compelling experience at all.</p>
<p>Because I still need, I would argue,</p>
<p>I still need the likes to know</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s a tweet worth reading.</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t only have a limited amount of time,</p>
<p>so I need to know what&rsquo;s valuable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like great Yelp reviews on tweets or something.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve turned off on, for example,</p>
<p>on my account on YouTube, I wrote a Chrome extension</p>
<p>that turns off all likes and dislikes and just views.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many views the video gets and so on.</p>
<p>Unless it&rsquo;s on my phone.</p>
<p>Did you take off the recommendations?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>On YouTube, some people,</p>
<p>distraction for YouTube is a big one for people.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not worried about the distraction</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m able to control myself on YouTube.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t rabbit hole.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t rabbit hole.</p>
<p>So you have to know your demons or your addictions</p>
<p>or whatever.</p>
<p>On YouTube, I&rsquo;m okay.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t keep clicking.</p>
<p>The negative feelings come from seeing the views</p>
<p>on stuff you&rsquo;ve created.</p>
<p>Oh, so you don&rsquo;t want to see your views.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just speaking to the things</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m aware of of myself that are helpful</p>
<p>and things that are not helpful emotionally.</p>
<p>And I feel like there should be,</p>
<p>we need to create actually tooling for ourselves.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not me with JavaScript,</p>
<p>but anybody is able to create,</p>
<p>sort of control the experience that they have.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, so my big unified theory on social media</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;m very bearish on the big platforms</p>
<p>having a long future.</p>
<p>You are.</p>
<p>I think the moment of three or four major platforms</p>
<p>is not gonna last, right?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This is just perspective, right?</p>
<p>So you can start shorting these stocks on my,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t tell.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not financial advice.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do it Robinhood.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s, I think the big mistake</p>
<p>the major platforms made as when they took out</p>
<p>the network effect advantage, right?</p>
<p>So the original pitch,</p>
<p>especially if something like Facebook or Instagram</p>
<p>was the people you know are on here, right?</p>
<p>So like what you use this for is you can connect to people</p>
<p>that you already know.</p>
<p>This is what makes the network useful.</p>
<p>So therefore the value of our network grows quadratically</p>
<p>with the number of users.</p>
<p>And therefore it&rsquo;s such a headstart</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no way that someone else can catch up.</p>
<p>But when they shifted and when Facebook took the lead</p>
<p>of say we&rsquo;re gonna shift towards a newsfeed model,</p>
<p>they basically said we&rsquo;re going to try to in the moment</p>
<p>get more data and get more likes.</p>
<p>Like what we&rsquo;re gonna go towards</p>
<p>is actually just seeing interesting stuff.</p>
<p>Like seeing different information.</p>
<p>So people took this social internet impulse</p>
<p>to connect to people digitally,</p>
<p>to other tools like group text messages</p>
<p>and WhatsApp and stuff like this, right?</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t think about these tools</p>
<p>as oh, this is where I connect with people.</p>
<p>Once it&rsquo;s just a feed that&rsquo;s kind of interesting,</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re competing with everything else</p>
<p>that can produce interesting content that&rsquo;s diverting.</p>
<p>And I think that is a much fiercer competition</p>
<p>because now for example, you&rsquo;re going up against podcasts,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>I mean like, okay, I guess the Twitter feed</p>
<p>is interesting right now,</p>
<p>but also a podcast is interesting</p>
<p>or something else could be interesting too.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a much fiercer competition</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s no more network effects, right?</p>
<p>And so my sense is we&rsquo;re gonna see a fragmentation</p>
<p>into what I call long tail social media,</p>
<p>where if I don&rsquo;t need everyone I know to be on a platform,</p>
<p>then why not have three or four bespoke platforms I use</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s a thousand people and we&rsquo;re all interested</p>
<p>in whatever, AI or comedy.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve perfected this interface</p>
<p>and maybe it&rsquo;s like Clubhouse, it&rsquo;s audio or something.</p>
<p>And we all pay $2 so that we don&rsquo;t have to worry</p>
<p>about attention harvesting.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s gonna be wildly more entertaining.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, I&rsquo;m thinking about comedians on Twitter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the best internet possible format</p>
<p>for them expressing themselves and being interesting.</p>
<p>That you have all these comedians that are trying to like,</p>
<p>well, I can do like little clips and little whatever.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know if there was a long tail social media.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s really, this is where the comedians are</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s podcasts and the comedians are on podcasts now.</p>
<p>So this is my thought is that there&rsquo;s really no,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s really no strong advantage</p>
<p>to having one large platform that everyone is on.</p>
<p>If all you&rsquo;re getting from it is,</p>
<p>I now have different options for diversion</p>
<p>and like uplifting aspirational</p>
<p>or whatever types of entertainment,</p>
<p>that whole thing could fragment.</p>
<p>And I think the glue that was holding together</p>
<p>was network effects.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they realized that when network effects</p>
<p>have been destabilized,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have the centrifugal force anymore</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re spinning faster and faster.</p>
<p>But is a Twitter feed really that much more interesting</p>
<p>than all of these streaming services?</p>
<p>Is it really that much more interesting</p>
<p>than Clubhouse, is it that much more interesting</p>
<p>than podcast?</p>
<p>I feel like they don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>how unstable their ground actually is.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>But the thing that makes Twitter and Facebook work,</p>
<p>I mean, the newsfeed, you&rsquo;re exactly right.</p>
<p>Like you can just duplicate the news.</p>
<p>Like if it&rsquo;s not the social network and it&rsquo;s the newsfeed,</p>
<p>then why not have multiple different feeds</p>
<p>that are more, that are better at satisfying.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a dopamine gamification that they&rsquo;ve figured out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so you have to, whatever you create,</p>
<p>you have to at least provide some pleasure</p>
<p>in that same gamification kind of way.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to have to do with scale</p>
<p>of large social networks.</p>
<p>But I mean, I guess you&rsquo;re implying that</p>
<p>you should be able to design that kind of mechanism</p>
<p>in other forms.</p>
<p>Or people are turning on that gamification.</p>
<p>I mean, so people are getting wise to it</p>
<p>and are getting uncomfortable about it, right?</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m offering something, these exist out here.</p>
<p>Like sugar.</p>
<p>People realize sugar&rsquo;s bad for you.</p>
<p>Yeah, sugar&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna stop eating it.</p>
<p>Yeah, drinking a lot&rsquo;s great too,</p>
<p>but also after a while you realize there&rsquo;s problems.</p>
<p>So some of the long tail social media networks</p>
<p>that are out there that I&rsquo;ve looked at,</p>
<p>they offer usually like a deeper sense of connection.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s usually interesting people</p>
<p>that you share some affinity</p>
<p>and you have these carefully cultivated.</p>
<p>I wrote this New Yorker piece a couple of years ago</p>
<p>about the indie social media movement</p>
<p>that really got into some of these different technologies.</p>
<p>But I think the technologies are a distraction.</p>
<p>We focus too much on Macedon versus whatever.</p>
<p>Like forget, or Discord.</p>
<p>Like actually let&rsquo;s forget the protocols right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the idea of, okay.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of these long tail social media groups,</p>
<p>what people are getting out of it,</p>
<p>which I think can outweigh the dopamine gamification</p>
<p>is strong connection and motivation.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re in a group with other guys</p>
<p>that are all trying to be better dads</p>
<p>or something like this.</p>
<p>And you talk to them on a regular basis</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re sharing your stories</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s interesting talks.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a powerful thing too.</p>
<p>One interesting thing about scale of Twitter</p>
<p>is you have these viral spread of information.</p>
<p>So sort of Twitter has become a newsmaker in itself.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>Well, yes, but I wonder what replaces that</p>
<p>because then you immediately.</p>
<p>Reporting?</p>
<p>Well, no.</p>
<p>Reporters have to do some work again, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>The problem with reporters and journalism</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;re intermediary.</p>
<p>They have control.</p>
<p>I mean, this is the problem in Russia currently</p>
<p>is that it creates a shield between the people and the news.</p>
<p>The interesting thing and the powerful thing about Twitter</p>
<p>is that the news originates from the individual</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s creating the news.</p>
<p>Like you have the former president of the United States</p>
<p>on Twitter creating news.</p>
<p>You have Elon Musk creating news.</p>
<p>You have people announcing stuff on Twitter</p>
<p>as opposed to talking to a journalist.</p>
<p>And that feels much more genuine</p>
<p>and it feels very powerful,</p>
<p>but actually coming to realize</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t need the social network.</p>
<p>You can just put that announcement</p>
<p>on a YouTube type thing.</p>
<p>This is what I&rsquo;m thinking.</p>
<p>Right, so this is my point about that</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>The democratizing power of the internet is fantastic.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m an old school internet nerd,</p>
<p>a guy that was telemeting in the servers</p>
<p>and gophering before the World Wide Web was around, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a huge internet booster.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of its big power.</p>
<p>But when you put everything on Twitter,</p>
<p>I think the fact that you&rsquo;ve taken,</p>
<p>you homogenized everything, right?</p>
<p>So everything looks the same,</p>
<p>moves with the same low friction is very difficult.</p>
<p>You have no what I call distributed curation, right?</p>
<p>The only curation that really happens,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little bit with likes and also the algorithm.</p>
<p>But if you look back to pre web 2.0 or early web 2.0,</p>
<p>when a lot of this was happening,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say on blogs where people own their own servers</p>
<p>and you had your different blogs,</p>
<p>there was this distributed curation that happened</p>
<p>where in order for your blog to get on people&rsquo;s radar</p>
<p>and this had nothing to do with any gatekeepers</p>
<p>or legacy media, it was over time you got more links</p>
<p>and people respected you</p>
<p>and you would hear about this blog over here</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this whole distributed curation</p>
<p>and filtering going on.</p>
<p>So if you think like the 2004 presidential election,</p>
<p>most of the information people are getting from the internet</p>
<p>was one of the first big internet news driven elections</p>
<p>was from, you had like the daily costs and drudge,</p>
<p>but there was like blogs that were out there</p>
<p>and this was back, Ezra Klein was just running a blog</p>
<p>out of his dorm room at this point, right?</p>
<p>And you would in a distributed fashion gain credibility</p>
<p>because okay, people have paid,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard to get people to pay attention to your blog,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re paying attention, they get linked to this kid Ezra</p>
<p>or whatever, it seems to be really sharp</p>
<p>and now people are noticing it</p>
<p>and now you have a distributed curation</p>
<p>that solves a lot of the problems we see</p>
<p>when you have a completely homogenized low friction</p>
<p>environment like friction where, I mean Twitter,</p>
<p>where any random conspiracy theory or whatever</p>
<p>that people like can just shoot through and spread,</p>
<p>whereas if you&rsquo;re starting a blog</p>
<p>to try to push QAnon or something like that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably gonna be a really weird looking blog</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna have a hard time,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s just never gonna show up on people&rsquo;s radar, right?</p>
<p>So everything you&rsquo;ve said up until the very last statement,</p>
<p>I would agree with.</p>
<p>This is a topic I don&rsquo;t know a ton about, I guess, QAnon.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, I think, I&rsquo;ll forget QAnon.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, we can.</p>
<p>But QAnon is, QAnon could be that,</p>
<p>I also don&rsquo;t know, I should know more,</p>
<p>I apologize, I don&rsquo;t know more.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a power and the downside,</p>
<p>you can have, I mean, Hitler could have a blog today</p>
<p>and you would have potentially a very large following</p>
<p>if he&rsquo;s charismatic, if he&rsquo;s as good with words,</p>
<p>is able to express the ideas,</p>
<p>whatever maybe he&rsquo;s able to channel,</p>
<p>the frustration, the anger that people have</p>
<p>about a certain thing.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s the power of blogs,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also the limitation, but that doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not trying to solve that.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t solve that, yeah.</p>
<p>The fundamental problem you&rsquo;re saying is not the problem.</p>
<p>Your thesis is that there&rsquo;s nothing special</p>
<p>about large scale social networks</p>
<p>that guarantees that they will keep existing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s important to remember</p>
<p>for a lot of the older generation of internet activists</p>
<p>or the people who are very pro internet in the early days,</p>
<p>they were completely flabbergasted</p>
<p>by the rise of these platforms.</p>
<p>Say, why would you take the internet</p>
<p>and then build your own version of the internet</p>
<p>where you own all the servers?</p>
<p>And we built this whole distributed,</p>
<p>the whole thing, we had open protocols.</p>
<p>Everyone anywhere in the world could use the same protocols.</p>
<p>Your machine can talk to any other machine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most democratic communication system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ever been built.</p>
<p>And then these companies came along and said,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna build our own,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll just own all the servers</p>
<p>and put them in buildings that we own.</p>
<p>And the internet will just be the first mile</p>
<p>that gets you into our private internet</p>
<p>where we owned the whole thing.</p>
<p>It went completely against the entire motivation</p>
<p>of the internet was like, yes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna be one person owns all the servers</p>
<p>and you pay to access them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s any one server that they own</p>
<p>could talk to anyone else&rsquo;s server</p>
<p>because we all agree on a standard set of protocols.</p>
<p>And so the old guard of pro internet people</p>
<p>never understood this move towards</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s build private versions of the internet.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll build three or four private internets</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll all use.</p>
<p>It was the opposite basically.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s funny enough, I don&rsquo;t know if you follow,</p>
<p>but Jack Dorsey is also as a proponent</p>
<p>and is helping to fund, create fully distributed</p>
<p>versions of Twitter, essentially,</p>
<p>I think that would potentially destroy Twitter.</p>
<p>But I think there might be financial,</p>
<p>like business cases to be made there, I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>But that seems to be another alternative</p>
<p>as opposed to creating a bunch of like the long tail,</p>
<p>creating like the ultimate long tail</p>
<p>of like fully distributed.</p>
<p>Yeah, which is what the internet is.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s sort of my long,</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m thinking about long tail social media,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking it&rsquo;s like the tech&rsquo;s not so important.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s groups out there, right?</p>
<p>I know where the tech they use to actually implement</p>
<p>their digital only social group, whatever,</p>
<p>they might use Slack, they might use some combination</p>
<p>of Zoom or it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>I think in the tech world,</p>
<p>we wanna build the beautiful protocol</p>
<p>that okay, everyone&rsquo;s gonna use</p>
<p>as just a federated server protocol</p>
<p>in which we&rsquo;ve worked out X, Y, and Z,</p>
<p>and no one understands it</p>
<p>because then the engineers need it all to make,</p>
<p>I get it because I&rsquo;m a nerd like this,</p>
<p>like, okay, every standard has to fit with everything else</p>
<p>and no one understands what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you have this group of bike enthusiasts</p>
<p>that are like, yeah, we&rsquo;ll just jump on to Zoom</p>
<p>and have some Slack and put up a blog.</p>
<p>The tech doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>Like we built a world with our own curation,</p>
<p>our own rules, our own sort of social ecosystem</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s generating a lot of value.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;ll happen.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of money at stake with obviously these large,</p>
<p>but I just think they&rsquo;re more,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so, I mean, look how quickly</p>
<p>Americans left Facebook, right?</p>
<p>I mean, Facebook was savvy to buy other properties</p>
<p>and to diversify, right?</p>
<p>But how quick did that take</p>
<p>for just standard Facebook news feed?</p>
<p>Everyone under the age of something were using it</p>
<p>and no one under a certain age is using it now.</p>
<p>It took like four years.</p>
<p>I mean, this stuff is really.</p>
<p>I believe people can leave Facebook overnight.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like I think Facebook hasn&rsquo;t actually messed up</p>
<p>like enough to, there&rsquo;s two things.</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t messed up enough</p>
<p>for people to really leave aggressively</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no good alternative for them to leave.</p>
<p>I think if good alternatives pop up,</p>
<p>it would just immediately happen.</p>
<p>The stuff is a lot more culturally fragile, I think.</p>
<p>I mean, Twitter&rsquo;s having a moment</p>
<p>because it was feeding a certain type of,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of anxieties</p>
<p>that was in the sort of political sphere anyways</p>
<p>that Twitter was working with,</p>
<p>but its moment could go to as well.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a really arbitrary thing.</p>
<p>Short little things.</p>
<p>I read a Wired article about this earlier in the pandemic.</p>
<p>This is crazy that the way</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re trying to communicate information</p>
<p>about the pandemic is all these weird arbitrary rules</p>
<p>where people are screenshotting pictures of articles</p>
<p>that are part of a tweet thread</p>
<p>where you say one slash in under it.</p>
<p>We have the technology guys</p>
<p>to really clearly convey long form information to people.</p>
<p>Why do we have these?</p>
<p>And I know this because it&rsquo;s the gamified dopamine hits,</p>
<p>but what a weird medium.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason for us to have to have these threads</p>
<p>that you have to find and pin with your screenshot.</p>
<p>I mean, we have technology</p>
<p>to communicate better using the internet.</p>
<p>I mean, why are epidemiologists having to do tweet threads?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s mechanisms of publishing</p>
<p>that make it easier on Twitter.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re evolving as a species</p>
<p>and the internet is a very fresh thing.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s kind of interesting to think</p>
<p>that as opposed to Twitter,</p>
<p>this is what Jack also complains about</p>
<p>is Twitter&rsquo;s not innovating fast enough.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s almost like the people are innovating</p>
<p>and thinking about their productive life faster</p>
<p>than the platforms on which they operate can catch up.</p>
<p>And so at the point the gap grows sufficiently,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll jump.</p>
<p>A few people, a few innovative folks</p>
<p>will just create an alternative</p>
<p>and perhaps distributed perhaps just many little silos</p>
<p>and then people will jump</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll just continue this kind of way.</p>
<p>Yeah, but see, I think like Substack, for example,</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re gonna pull out of Twitter,</p>
<p>among other things, is the audience that was,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, like slightly left of center,</p>
<p>but slightly left of center, don&rsquo;t like Trump,</p>
<p>uncomfortable with like postmodern critical theories</p>
<p>made into political action, right?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, yeah, Twitter,</p>
<p>there was people on there talking about this</p>
<p>and it made me feel sort of hurt</p>
<p>because I was feeling a little bit like a nerd about it.</p>
<p>But honestly, I&rsquo;d probably rather subscribe</p>
<p>to the four subs, you know, I&rsquo;m gonna have like Barry&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and Andrew Sullivan&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;ll have like a Jesse Signals,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ll have a few substacks I can subscribe to</p>
<p>and honestly, I&rsquo;m a knowledge worker who&rsquo;s 32 anyways,</p>
<p>probably that&rsquo;s an email all day.</p>
<p>And so like, there&rsquo;s an innovation that&rsquo;s gonna,</p>
<p>that group, you know, it&rsquo;s gonna suck them off.</p>
<p>Which is actually a very large group.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a lot of energy.</p>
<p>And then once Trump&rsquo;s gone,</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s probably gonna drive,</p>
<p>that drove a lot of more like Trump people off Twitter.</p>
<p>Like this stuff is fragile, I think.</p>
<p>I, but the fascinating thing to me,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve hung out on Parler for a short amount enough</p>
<p>to know that the interface matters.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so fascinating like that,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not just about ideas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about creating like Substack 2,</p>
<p>creating a pleasant experience, a dicting experience.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re right, you&rsquo;re right about that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s why the, this is one of the conclusions</p>
<p>from that indie social media article</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s just the ugliness matters.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean even just aesthetically,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the clunkiness of the interfaces.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>to some degree, the social media companies</p>
<p>have spent a lot of money on this.</p>
<p>And to some degree, it&rsquo;s a survivorship bias, right?</p>
<p>I think Twitter, every time I hear Jack talks about this,</p>
<p>it seems like he&rsquo;s as surprised as anyone else,</p>
<p>the way Twitter is being used.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s basically the way, you know,</p>
<p>they had it years ago.</p>
<p>And then, you know, it was like, great,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be statuses, right?</p>
<p>This is what I&rsquo;m doing, you know?</p>
<p>And my friends can follow me and see it.</p>
<p>Without really changing anything,</p>
<p>it just happened to hit everything right</p>
<p>to support this other type of interaction.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s also the JavaScript model,</p>
<p>which Brendan Eich talked about.</p>
<p>He just implemented JavaScript,</p>
<p>like the crappy version of JavaScript in 10 days,</p>
<p>threw it out there and just changed it really quickly,</p>
<p>evolved it really quickly.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s become, according to Stack Exchange,</p>
<p>the most popular programming language in the world</p>
<p>that drives like most of the internet</p>
<p>and even the backend and now mobile.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s an argument for the kind of thing</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about where like the bike club people</p>
<p>could literally create the thing that would, you know,</p>
<p>run most of the internet in 10 years from now.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something to that,</p>
<p>like as opposed to trying to get lucky</p>
<p>or trying to think through stuff</p>
<p>is just to solve a particular problem.</p>
<p>Do stuff, yeah.</p>
<p>And then do stuff.</p>
<p>Do stuff, keep tinkering until you love it.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>And then, and of course the sad thing is timing and luck</p>
<p>matter and that you can&rsquo;t really control.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t go back to 2007.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the number one thing you could do</p>
<p>to have a lot of success with a new platform</p>
<p>is go back in time 14 years.</p>
<p>So the thing you have to kind of think about</p>
<p>is what is the like, what&rsquo;s the totally new thing</p>
<p>that 10 years from now would seem obvious.</p>
<p>I mean, some people saying clubhouses that,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a lot of stuff like clubhouse before,</p>
<p>but it hit the right kind of thing.</p>
<p>Similar to Tesla actually,</p>
<p>what clubhouse did is it got a lot of</p>
<p>relatively famous people on there quickly.</p>
<p>And then the other effect is like, it&rsquo;s invite only.</p>
<p>So like, oh, all the smart, like famous people are on there.</p>
<p>I wonder what&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s the FOMO,</p>
<p>like fear that you&rsquo;re missing something really profound</p>
<p>as exciting happening there.</p>
<p>So those social effects.</p>
<p>And then once they actually show up,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the JavaScript model is like,</p>
<p>clubhouse is so dumb, like so simple in its interface.</p>
<p>Like you literally can&rsquo;t do anything except mute, unmute.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a mute button.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a leave quietly button.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kinda.</p>
<p>I love single use technology that sense, yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no like, there&rsquo;s no,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like trivial.</p>
<p>And Twitter kinda started like that.</p>
<p>Facebook started like that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;ve evolved quickly to add all these features</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>And I do hope clubhouse stays that way.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be interesting.</p>
<p>Or there&rsquo;s alternatives.</p>
<p>I mean, even with clubhouse though,</p>
<p>so one of the issues with a lot of these platforms</p>
<p>I think is bits are cheap enough now</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t really need a unicorn investor model.</p>
<p>I mean, the investors need that model.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s really not really an imperative</p>
<p>of we need something that can scale</p>
<p>to a hundred million plus a year revenue.</p>
<p>So, because it was gonna require this much seed</p>
<p>and angel investment,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not gonna get this much seed angel investment</p>
<p>unless you can have a potential exit this wide</p>
<p>because you have to be part of a portfolio</p>
<p>that depends on one out of 10 exiting here.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t actually need that</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t need to satisfy that investor model,</p>
<p>which I think is basically the case.</p>
<p>I mean, bits are so cheap.</p>
<p>Everything is so cheap.</p>
<p>So even like with clubhouse, it&rsquo;s investor backed, right?</p>
<p>This notion of like, this needs to be a major platform,</p>
<p>but the bike club doesn&rsquo;t necessarily need a major platform.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m interested.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much money.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only problem that bets against me</p>
<p>is that you can concentrate a lot of capital</p>
<p>if you do these things, right?</p>
<p>I mean, so Facebook was like</p>
<p>a fantastic capital concentration machine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy how much,</p>
<p>where it even found that capital in the world</p>
<p>that it could concentrate and ossify in the stock price</p>
<p>that a very small number of people have access to, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredibly powerful.</p>
<p>So when there is a possibility to consolidate</p>
<p>and gather a huge amount of capital,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a huge imperative</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very hard for the bike club to go up against, so.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot of money in the bike club.</p>
<p>If you see what the Wall Street bets</p>
<p>on that when a bunch of people get together,</p>
<p>I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be a bike.</p>
<p>It could be a bunch of different bike clubs</p>
<p>just kind of team up to overtake.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing now, yeah.</p>
<p>Or we&rsquo;re gonna repurpose off the shelf stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not, yeah, we&rsquo;re gonna repurpose</p>
<p>whatever it was for office productivity or something,</p>
<p>and like the clubs using Slack</p>
<p>just to build out these, you know.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about email.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I wrote a book.</p>
<p>You wrote yet another amazing book,</p>
<p>A World Without Email.</p>
<p>Maybe one way to enter this discussion</p>
<p>is to ask what is the hyperactive hive mind,</p>
<p>which is the concept you opened the book with?</p>
<p>Yeah, and the devil.</p>
<p>And the devil.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the scourge of hundreds of millions.</p>
<p>So I think, so I called this book A World Without Email.</p>
<p>The real title should be A World</p>
<p>Without the Hyperactive Hive Mind Workflow,</p>
<p>but my publisher didn&rsquo;t like that, right?</p>
<p>So we had to get a little bit more pithy.</p>
<p>I was trying to answer the question after deep work,</p>
<p>why is it so hard to do this?</p>
<p>Like, if this is so valuable,</p>
<p>if we can produce much higher,</p>
<p>if people are much happier,</p>
<p>why do we check email a day?</p>
<p>Why are we on Slack all day?</p>
<p>And so I started working on this book</p>
<p>immediately after deep work.</p>
<p>And so my initial interviews were done in 2016.</p>
<p>So it took five years to pull the threads together.</p>
<p>I was trying to understand why is it so hard</p>
<p>for most people to actually find any time</p>
<p>to do the stuff that actually moves the needle?</p>
<p>And the story was, and I thought this was,</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t heard this reported anywhere else.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it took me so long to pull it together,</p>
<p>is email arrives on the scene,</p>
<p>email spreads, I trace it,</p>
<p>it really picks up steam in the early 1990s,</p>
<p>between like 1990 and 1995, it makes its move, right?</p>
<p>And it does so for very pragmatic reasons.</p>
<p>It was replacing existing communication technologies</p>
<p>that it was better than.</p>
<p>It was mainly the fax machine, voicemail, and memos, right?</p>
<p>So this was just better, right?</p>
<p>So it was a killer app because it was useful.</p>
<p>In its wake came a new way of collaborating,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the Hyperactive Hive Mind.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like the virus that follows the rats</p>
<p>that went through Western Europe for the Black Pig.</p>
<p>As email spread through organizations,</p>
<p>in its wake came the Hyperactive Hive Mind workflow,</p>
<p>which says, okay, guys,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the way we&rsquo;re gonna collaborate.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll just work things out on the fly</p>
<p>with unscheduled back and forth messages.</p>
<p>Just boom, boom, boom, let&rsquo;s go back and forth.</p>
<p>Hey, what about this?</p>
<p>Did you see this?</p>
<p>What about that client?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on over here?</p>
<p>That followed email.</p>
<p>It completely took over office work.</p>
<p>And the need to keep up with all of these asynchronous</p>
<p>back and forth unscheduled messages,</p>
<p>as those got more and more and more,</p>
<p>and we had more of those to service,</p>
<p>the need to service those required us to check</p>
<p>more and more and more and more, right?</p>
<p>And so by the time, and I go through the numbers,</p>
<p>but by the time you get to today,</p>
<p>now the average knowledge worker</p>
<p>has to check one of these channels once every six minutes.</p>
<p>Because every single thing you do in your organization,</p>
<p>how you talk to your colleagues,</p>
<p>how you talk to your vendors,</p>
<p>how you talk to your clients,</p>
<p>how you talk to the HR department,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all this asynchronous unscheduled</p>
<p>back and forth messaging.</p>
<p>And you have to service the conversations.</p>
<p>And it spiraled out of control,</p>
<p>and it has sort of devolved a lot of work in the office now</p>
<p>to all I do is constantly tend communication channels.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s fascinating what you&rsquo;re describing</p>
<p>is nobody ever paused in this whole evolution</p>
<p>to try to create a system that actually works.</p>
<p>That it was kind of like a huge fan of cellular automata.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just kind of started a very simple mechanism,</p>
<p>just like cellular automata.</p>
<p>It just kind of grew to overtake</p>
<p>all the fundamental communication</p>
<p>of how we do business and also personal life.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that&rsquo;s one of the big ideas</p>
<p>is that the unintentionality, right?</p>
<p>So this goes back to technological determinism.</p>
<p>I mean, this is a weird business book</p>
<p>because I go deep on philosophy.</p>
<p>I go deep on, for some reason,</p>
<p>we get into paleoanthropology for a while.</p>
<p>We do a lot of neuroscience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a weird book.</p>
<p>But I got real into this technological determinism, right?</p>
<p>This notion that just the presence of a technology</p>
<p>can change how people act.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my big argument</p>
<p>about what happened with the hive mind.</p>
<p>And I can document specific examples, right?</p>
<p>So I document this example in IBM, 1987, maybe 85,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s in like the mid to late eighties,</p>
<p>IBM, R. Monk headquarters.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna put an internal email, right?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s convenient.</p>
<p>And so they ran a whole study.</p>
<p>And so I talked to the engineer who ran the study,</p>
<p>Adrian Stone, like we&rsquo;re gonna run this study</p>
<p>to figure out how much do we communicate</p>
<p>because it was still an era where it&rsquo;s expensive, right?</p>
<p>So you have to provision a mainframe.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t over provision.</p>
<p>Like we wanna know how much communication actually happened.</p>
<p>So they went and figured it out.</p>
<p>How many memos, how many calls, how many notes, great.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll provision a mainframe to handle email</p>
<p>that can handle all of that.</p>
<p>So if all of our communication moves to email,</p>
<p>the mainframe will still be fine.</p>
<p>In three days, they had melted it down.</p>
<p>People were communicating six times more than that estimate.</p>
<p>So just in three days, the presence</p>
<p>of a low friction digital communication tool</p>
<p>drastically changed how everyone collaborated.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not enough time for an all hands meeting.</p>
<p>Guys, we figured it out.</p>
<p>This is what we need to communicate a lot more</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s gonna make us more productive.</p>
<p>We need more emails.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s emergent.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that just on the positive end, amazing to you?</p>
<p>Like, isn&rsquo;t email amazing?</p>
<p>Like in those early days,</p>
<p>like just the frictionless communication.</p>
<p>I mean, email is awesome.</p>
<p>Like people say that there&rsquo;s a lot of problems with emails,</p>
<p>just like people say a lot of problems with Twitter</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of cool that you can just send a little note.</p>
<p>It was a miracle, right?</p>
<p>So I wrote a, there&rsquo;s originally was a New Yorker piece</p>
<p>from a year or two ago called, was email a mistake?</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s in the book too.</p>
<p>But I go into the history of email,</p>
<p>like why did it come along?</p>
<p>And it solved a huge problem.</p>
<p>It was the problem of fast asynchronous communication.</p>
<p>And it was a problem that did not exist</p>
<p>until we got large offices.</p>
<p>We got large offices, synchronous communication,</p>
<p>like let&rsquo;s get on the phone at the same time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s too much overhead to it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s too many people you might have to talk to.</p>
<p>Asynchronous communication,</p>
<p>like let me send you a memo when I&rsquo;m ready</p>
<p>and you can read it when you&rsquo;re ready, took too long.</p>
<p>And so it was like a huge problem.</p>
<p>So one of the things I talked about is the way that</p>
<p>when they built the CIA headquarters,</p>
<p>there was such a need for fast asynchronous communication</p>
<p>that they built a pneumatic powered email system.</p>
<p>They had these pneumatic tubes</p>
<p>all throughout the headquarters</p>
<p>with electromagnetic routers.</p>
<p>So you would put your message in a plexiglass tube</p>
<p>and you would turn these brass dials about the location.</p>
<p>You would stick it in these things and pneumatic tubes</p>
<p>and it would shoot and sort</p>
<p>and work its way through these tubes</p>
<p>to show up in just a minute or something at the floor</p>
<p>and at the general office suite where you wanted to go.</p>
<p>And my point is the fact that they spent so much money</p>
<p>to make that work,</p>
<p>to show how important fast asynchronous communication</p>
<p>was to large offices.</p>
<p>So when email came along,</p>
<p>it was a productivity silver bullet.</p>
<p>It was a miracle.</p>
<p>I talked to the researchers who were working</p>
<p>on computer supported collaboration in the late 80s,</p>
<p>trying to figure out how are we gonna use</p>
<p>computer networks to be more productive?</p>
<p>And they were building all these systems and tools.</p>
<p>Email showed up,</p>
<p>it just wiped all that research off the map.</p>
<p>There was no need to build</p>
<p>these custom intranet applications.</p>
<p>There was no need to build these communication platforms.</p>
<p>Email could just do everything.</p>
<p>So it was a miracle application,</p>
<p>which is why it spread everywhere.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of these things where,</p>
<p>okay, on into the consequences, right?</p>
<p>You had this miracle productivity silver bullet.</p>
<p>It spread everywhere,</p>
<p>but it was so effective.</p>
<p>It just, I don&rsquo;t know, like a drug.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s some pandemic metaphor here,</p>
<p>analogy here of a drug that like it&rsquo;s so effective</p>
<p>at treating this that it also blows up</p>
<p>your whole immune system and then everyone gets sick.</p>
<p>Well, ultimately it probably significantly increased</p>
<p>the productivity of the world,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a kind of hump that it now has plateaued.</p>
<p>And then the fundamental question you&rsquo;re asking is like,</p>
<p>okay, how do we take the next,</p>
<p>how do we keep increasing the productivity?</p>
<p>Now, I think it brought it down.</p>
<p>So my contention,</p>
<p>and so again, there&rsquo;s a little bit in the book,</p>
<p>but I have a more recent Wired article</p>
<p>that puts some newer numbers to this.</p>
<p>I subscribed to the hypothesis</p>
<p>that the hyperactive hive mind was so detrimental.</p>
<p>So yeah, it helped productivity at first, right?</p>
<p>When you could do fast asynchronous communication,</p>
<p>but very quickly there was a sort of exponential rise</p>
<p>in communication amounts.</p>
<p>Once we got to the point where the hive mind meant</p>
<p>you had to constantly check your email,</p>
<p>I think that made us so unproductive</p>
<p>that it actually was pulling down</p>
<p>non industrial productivity.</p>
<p>And I think the only reason why,</p>
<p>so it certainly has not been going up.</p>
<p>That metric has been stagnating for a long time now</p>
<p>while all of this was going on.</p>
<p>I think the only reason why it hasn&rsquo;t fallen</p>
<p>is that we added these extra shifts off the books.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna work for three hours in the morning,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna work for three hours at night.</p>
<p>And only that I think has allowed us</p>
<p>to basically maintain a stagnated non industrial growth.</p>
<p>We should have been shooting up the charts.</p>
<p>I mean, this is miraculous innovations,</p>
<p>the computer networks.</p>
<p>And then we built out these hundred billion dollar</p>
<p>ubiquitous worldwide high speed wireless internet</p>
<p>infrastructure with supercomputers in our pockets</p>
<p>where we could talk to anyone at any time.</p>
<p>Like why did our productivity not shoot off the charts?</p>
<p>Because our brain can&rsquo;t context switch</p>
<p>once every six minutes.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s fundamentally back to the context switching.</p>
<p>Context switching is poison.</p>
<p>What is it about email that forces context switching?</p>
<p>Is it both our psychology that drags us in?</p>
<p>Or is it the expectation?</p>
<p>Yeah, right, right.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not, I think we&rsquo;ve seen this</p>
<p>through a personal will or failure lens recently.</p>
<p>Like, oh, am I addicted to email?</p>
<p>I have bad etiquette about my email.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s the underlying workflow.</p>
<p>So the tool itself I will exonerate.</p>
<p>I think I would rather use POP3 than a fax protocol.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s easier.</p>
<p>The issue is the hyperactive hive mind workflow.</p>
<p>So if I am now collaborating with 20 or 30 different people</p>
<p>with back and forth unscheduled messaging,</p>
<p>I have to tend those conversations, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you have 30 metaphorical ping pong tables.</p>
<p>And when the balls come back across,</p>
<p>you have to pretty soon hit it back</p>
<p>or stuff actually grinds to a halt.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the workflow that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the tools, the fact that we use it</p>
<p>to do all of our collaboration.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just send messages back and forth,</p>
<p>which means you can&rsquo;t be far from checking that.</p>
<p>Cause if you take a break, if you batch,</p>
<p>if you try to have better habits,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna slow things down.</p>
<p>So my whole villain is this hyperactive hive mind workflow.</p>
<p>The tool is fine.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want the tool to go away,</p>
<p>but I wanna replace the hyperactive hive mind workflow.</p>
<p>I think this is gonna be one of the biggest</p>
<p>value generating productivity revolutions</p>
<p>of the 21st century.</p>
<p>I quote an anonymous CEO who&rsquo;s pretty well known</p>
<p>who says this is gonna be the moonshot of the 21st century.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be of that importance.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much latent productivity that&rsquo;s being suppressed</p>
<p>because we just figure things out on the fly in email</p>
<p>that as we figure that out,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gonna be hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re so absolutely right.</p>
<p>The question is, what is a world without email look like?</p>
<p>How do we fix email?</p>
<p>So what happens is, at least in my vision,</p>
<p>you identify, well, actually there&rsquo;s these different</p>
<p>processes that make up my workday.</p>
<p>Like these are things that I do repeatedly,</p>
<p>often in collaboration with other people</p>
<p>that do useful things for my company or whatever.</p>
<p>Right now, most of these processes are implicitly implemented</p>
<p>with the hyperactive hive mind.</p>
<p>How do we do this thing?</p>
<p>Like answering client questions</p>
<p>to shoot messages back and forth.</p>
<p>How do we do this thing?</p>
<p>Posting podcast episodes,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll just figure it out on the fly.</p>
<p>My main argument is we actually have to do</p>
<p>like they did in the industrial sector,</p>
<p>take each of these processes and say,</p>
<p>is there a better way to do this?</p>
<p>And by better, I mean a way that&rsquo;s gonna minimize the need</p>
<p>to have unscheduled back and forth messaging.</p>
<p>So we actually have to do process engineering.</p>
<p>This created a massive growth and productivity</p>
<p>in the industrial sector during the 20th century.</p>
<p>We have to do it in knowledge work.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t just rock and roll an inbox</p>
<p>as we actually have to say,</p>
<p>how do we deal with client questions?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s put in place a process</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t require us to send messages back and forth.</p>
<p>How do we post podcast episodes?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s automate this to a degree where</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to just send you a message on the fly.</p>
<p>And you do this process by process</p>
<p>and the pressure on that inbox is released.</p>
<p>And now you don&rsquo;t have to check it every six minutes.</p>
<p>So you still have email.</p>
<p>I mean, like I need to send you a file.</p>
<p>Sure, I&rsquo;ll use email,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re not coordinating or collaborating over email</p>
<p>or Slack, which is just a faster way of doing the hive mind.</p>
<p>I mean, Slack doesn&rsquo;t solve anything there.</p>
<p>You have better structured bespoke processes.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s gonna unleash</p>
<p>this massive productivity.</p>
<p>Bespoke, so the interesting thing is like,</p>
<p>for example, you and I exchange some emails.</p>
<p>So obviously I, let&rsquo;s just say in my particular case,</p>
<p>I schedule podcasts.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of different tasks,</p>
<p>fascinatingly enough, that I do</p>
<p>that can be converted into processes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is it up to me to create that process?</p>
<p>Or do you think we also need to build tools</p>
<p>just like email was a protocol</p>
<p>for helping us create processes for the different tasks?</p>
<p>I mean, I think ultimately the whole organization,</p>
<p>the whole team has to be involved.</p>
<p>I think ultimately there&rsquo;s certainly</p>
<p>a lot of investor money being spent right now</p>
<p>to try to figure out those tools, right?</p>
<p>So I think Silicon Valley has figured this out</p>
<p>in the past couple of years.</p>
<p>This is the difference between</p>
<p>when I was talking to people after Deep Work</p>
<p>and now five years later is this scent is in the air, right?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s so much latent productivity.</p>
<p>So yes, there are gonna be new tools,</p>
<p>which I think could help.</p>
<p>There are already tools that exist.</p>
<p>I mean, in the different groups I profiled use things</p>
<p>like Trello or Basecamp or Asana or Flow</p>
<p>and our schedule wants and acuity,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a lot of tools out there.</p>
<p>The key is not to think about it in terms of</p>
<p>what tool do I replace email with?</p>
<p>Instead, you think about it with,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to come up with a process</p>
<p>that reduces back and forth messages.</p>
<p>Oh, what tool might help us do that?</p>
<p>Yeah, and I would push,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not about necessarily efficiency.</p>
<p>In fact, some of these things are gonna take more time.</p>
<p>So writing a letter to someone is like a high value activity</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably worth doing.</p>
<p>The thing that&rsquo;s killer is the back and forth</p>
<p>because now I have to keep checking, right?</p>
<p>So we scheduled this together</p>
<p>because I knew you from before,</p>
<p>but like most of the interviews I was scheduling for this</p>
<p>actually I have a process with my publicist</p>
<p>where we use a shared document and she puts stuffs in there</p>
<p>and then I check it twice a week</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s scheduling options.</p>
<p>I say, here&rsquo;s when I wanna do this one</p>
<p>or this will work for this one or whatever.</p>
<p>And it takes more time in the moment than just,</p>
<p>but it means that we have almost no back and forth messaging</p>
<p>for podcast scheduling, which without this,</p>
<p>so like with my UK publisher,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t put this process in the place</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re not doing as many interviews,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all the time.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, oh, I could really feel the difference, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the back and forth that&rsquo;s killer.</p>
<p>I suppose it is up to the individual people involved,</p>
<p>like you said, knowledge workers,</p>
<p>like they have to carry the responsibility</p>
<p>of creating processes.</p>
<p>Like how always asking the first principles question,</p>
<p>how can this be converted into a process?</p>
<p>Yeah, so you can start by doing this yourself,</p>
<p>like just with what you can control.</p>
<p>I think ultimately once the teams are doing that,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s probably the right scale.</p>
<p>If you try to do this at the organizational scale,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get bureaucracy, right?</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s, if Elon Musk is gonna dictate down</p>
<p>to everyone at Tesla or something like this,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s too much remove and you get bureaucracy.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;re a team of six that&rsquo;s working together</p>
<p>on whatever powertrain software,</p>
<p>then we can figure out on our own, what are our processes?</p>
<p>How do we wanna do this?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s ultimately also creating a culture</p>
<p>where saying like an email, sending an email</p>
<p>just for the hell of it, it should be taboo.</p>
<p>So you are being, you&rsquo;re being destructive</p>
<p>to the productivity of the team by sending this email.</p>
<p>As opposed to helping develop a process and so on</p>
<p>that will ultimately automate this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m trying to spread this message</p>
<p>of the context switches as poison.</p>
<p>I get so much into the science of it.</p>
<p>I think we underestimate how much it kills us</p>
<p>to have to wrench away our context,</p>
<p>look at a message and come back.</p>
<p>And so once you have the mindset of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a huge thing to ask of someone</p>
<p>to have to take their attention off something</p>
<p>and look back at this.</p>
<p>And if they have to do that for three or four times,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re just gonna figure this out on the fly</p>
<p>and every message is gonna require five checks</p>
<p>of the inbox while you wait for it.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;ve created whatever it is at this point,</p>
<p>25 or 30 context shifts.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;ve just done a huge disservice to someone&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p>This would be like, if I had a professional athlete,</p>
<p>like, hey, do me a favor.</p>
<p>I need you to go do this press interview,</p>
<p>but to get there, you&rsquo;re gonna have to carry this sandbag</p>
<p>and sprint up this hill, like completely exhaust</p>
<p>your muscles and then you have to go play a game.</p>
<p>Like, of course I&rsquo;m not gonna ask an athlete</p>
<p>to do like an incredibly physically demanding thing</p>
<p>right before a game,</p>
<p>but something as easy as thoughts, question mark,</p>
<p>or like, hey, do you wanna jump on a call</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna be six back and forth messages</p>
<p>to figure it out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of the cognitive equivalent, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re taking the wind out of someone.</p>
<p>Yeah, and by the way, for people who are listening,</p>
<p>because I recently posted a few job openings</p>
<p>for us so I wanted to help with this thing.</p>
<p>And one of the things that people are surprised</p>
<p>when they work with me is how many spreadsheets</p>
<p>and processes are involved.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like Claude Shannon, right?</p>
<p>I talked about communication theory or information theory.</p>
<p>It takes time to come up with a clever code upfront.</p>
<p>So you spend more time upfront figuring out those</p>
<p>spreadsheets and trying to get people on board with it.</p>
<p>But then your communication going forward</p>
<p>is all much more efficient.</p>
<p>So over time, you&rsquo;re using much less bandwidth, right?</p>
<p>So you do pain upfront.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quicker just right now to send an email.</p>
<p>But if I spend a half day to do this</p>
<p>over the next six months, I&rsquo;ve saved myself 600 emails.</p>
<p>Now, here&rsquo;s a tough question for, you know,</p>
<p>from the computer science perspective,</p>
<p>we often over optimize.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve create processes and you, okay,</p>
<p>just like you&rsquo;re saying, it&rsquo;s so pleasurable</p>
<p>to increase in the longterm productivity</p>
<p>that sometimes you just enjoy that process in itself</p>
<p>by just creating processes and you actually never,</p>
<p>like it has a negative effect on productivity longterm</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re too obsessed with the processes.</p>
<p>Is that a nice problem to have essentially?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>I mean, because let&rsquo;s look at the one sector</p>
<p>that does do this, which is developers, right?</p>
<p>So agile methodologies like Scrum or Kanban</p>
<p>are basically workflow methodologies</p>
<p>that are much better than the hyperactive hive mind.</p>
<p>But man, some of those programmers get pretty obsessive.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever talked to a whatever</p>
<p>level three Scrum master.</p>
<p>They get really obsessive about like,</p>
<p>it has to happen exactly this way</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s probably seven times more complex</p>
<p>than it needs to be.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping that&rsquo;s just because nerds like me,</p>
<p>you know, like to do that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a broadly probably an issue, right?</p>
<p>We have to be careful because you can just go down</p>
<p>that fiddling path.</p>
<p>Like, so it needs to be, here&rsquo;s how we do it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s reduce the messages and let&rsquo;s roll, you know?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t save yourself through,</p>
<p>if you can get the process just right, right?</p>
<p>So I wrote this article kind of recently</p>
<p>called The Rise and Fall of Getting Things Done.</p>
<p>And I profiled this productivity guru named Merlin Mann.</p>
<p>And I talked about this movement called Productivity Prawn</p>
<p>as like elite speak term in the early 2000s</p>
<p>where people just became convinced</p>
<p>that if they could combine their productivity systems</p>
<p>with software and they could find just the right software,</p>
<p>just the right configuration where they could offload</p>
<p>most of the difficulty of work,</p>
<p>what happened with the machines,</p>
<p>when it kind of figured out for,</p>
<p>and then they could just sort of crank widgets and it&rsquo;d be,</p>
<p>and the whole thing fell apart</p>
<p>because work is hard and it&rsquo;s hard to do</p>
<p>and making decisions about what to work on is hard</p>
<p>and no system can really do that for you.</p>
<p>So you have to have this sort of balance between,</p>
<p>context switches are poison.</p>
<p>So we got to get rid of the context switches.</p>
<p>Once like something&rsquo;s working good enough</p>
<p>to get rid of the context switches, then get after it.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a psychological process there for me.</p>
<p>The OCD nature, like I&rsquo;ve literally,</p>
<p>embarrassing enough, have lost my shit before when,</p>
<p>so in many of the processes that involve Python scripts,</p>
<p>the rule is to not use spaces.</p>
<p>Underscores, there&rsquo;s like rules</p>
<p>for like how you format stuff, okay?</p>
<p>And like, I should not lose my shit</p>
<p>when somebody had a space and maybe capital letters,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s okay to have a space</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s this feeling like something&rsquo;s not perfect.</p>
<p>And as opposed to in the Python script,</p>
<p>allowing some flexibility around that,</p>
<p>you create this programmatic way that&rsquo;s flawless</p>
<p>and when everything&rsquo;s working perfectly, it&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<p>But actually, if you strive for perfection,</p>
<p>it has the same stress, like has a lot of the stress</p>
<p>that you were seeking to escape with the context switching</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re almost stressing about errors.</p>
<p>Like when the process is functioning,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always this anxiety of like,</p>
<p>I wonder if it&rsquo;s gonna succeed.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, no, I think some of that&rsquo;s just you and I probably.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just our mindset, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in, we do computer science, right?</p>
<p>So chicken and egg, I guess.</p>
<p>And a lot of the processes end up working here much rougher.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, instead of letting clients</p>
<p>just email me all the time, we have a weekly call</p>
<p>and then we send them a breakdown</p>
<p>of everything we committed to, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a process that works.</p>
<p>Okay, I get asked a lot of questions</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m the JavaScript guy in the company.</p>
<p>Instead of doing it by email, I have office hours.</p>
<p>This is what Basecamp does.</p>
<p>All right, so you come to my office hours,</p>
<p>that cuts down a lot of back and forth.</p>
<p>All right, we&rsquo;re gonna, instead of emailing</p>
<p>about this project, we&rsquo;ll have a Trello board</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll do a weekly really structured status meeting</p>
<p>real quick, what&rsquo;s going on, who needs what, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>And now everything&rsquo;s on there and on our inboxes,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have to send as many messages.</p>
<p>So like that rough level of granularity,</p>
<p>that gets you most of the way there.</p>
<p>So the parts that you can&rsquo;t automate</p>
<p>and turn into a process.</p>
<p>So how many parts like that do you think</p>
<p>should remain in a perfect world?</p>
<p>And for those parts where email is still useful,</p>
<p>what do you recommend those emails look like?</p>
<p>How should you write emails?</p>
<p>When should you send them?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think email is good for delivering information.</p>
<p>Right, so I think of it like a fax machine or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really good fax machine.</p>
<p>So if I need to send you something</p>
<p>and you just send you a file,</p>
<p>I need to broadcast a new policy or something,</p>
<p>like email is a great way to do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad for collaboration.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re having a conversation,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re trying to reach a decision on something,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to learn about something,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to clarify what this is,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more than just like a one answer type question,</p>
<p>then I think that you shouldn&rsquo;t be doing an email.</p>
<p>But see, here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>Like you and I don&rsquo;t talk often</p>
<p>and so we have a kind of new interaction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, so sure, yeah, you have a book coming out,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a process and so on,</p>
<p>but say there, don&rsquo;t you think there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of novel interactive experiences?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>So you could, just for every novel experience,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s okay to have a little bit of exchange.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Like I think it&rsquo;s fine if stuff comes in over the transom</p>
<p>or you hear from someone you haven&rsquo;t heard from in a while.</p>
<p>I think all that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s email at its best.</p>
<p>Where it starts to kill us is where all</p>
<p>of our collaboration is happening with the back and forth.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;ve moved the bulk of that out of your inbox,</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re back in that Meg Ryan movie, like You Got Mail,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, all right, load this up</p>
<p>and you wait for the boat and be like,</p>
<p>oh, we got a message.</p>
<p>Yeah, Lex sent me a message.</p>
<p>This is interesting, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re back to the AOL days.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re talking about the bulk of the business world</p>
<p>where email has replaced the actual communication,</p>
<p>all of the communication protocols required</p>
<p>to accomplish anything.</p>
<p>Everything is just happening with messages.</p>
<p>So if you now get most stuff done,</p>
<p>repeatable collaborations with other processes</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t require you to check these inboxes,</p>
<p>then the inbox can serve like an inbox,</p>
<p>which includes hearing from interesting people, right?</p>
<p>Or sending something, hey, I don&rsquo;t know if you saw this,</p>
<p>I thought you might like it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s great for that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s probably a bunch of people listening to this.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, yeah, but I work on a team</p>
<p>and all they use is email.</p>
<p>How do you start the revolution from the ground up?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, do asymmetric optimization first.</p>
<p>So identify all your processes</p>
<p>and then change what you can change</p>
<p>and be socially very careful about it.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t necessarily say like, okay,</p>
<p>this is a new process we all have to do.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just, hey, we gotta get this report ready.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I think we should do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get a draft into our Dropbox folder</p>
<p>by noon on Monday, grab it.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t touch it again until Tuesday morning</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll look at your changes.</p>
<p>I have this office hours always scheduled Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s anything that catches your attention,</p>
<p>grab me then.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve told the designer who CC&rsquo;d on this</p>
<p>that by COB Tuesday, the final version will be ready</p>
<p>for them to take and polish or whatever.</p>
<p>Like the person on the other end is like, great,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad Cal has a plan.</p>
<p>So what do I need to do?</p>
<p>I need to edit this tomorrow, whatever, right?</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ve actually pulled them into a process.</p>
<p>That means we&rsquo;re gonna get this report together</p>
<p>without having to just go back and forth.</p>
<p>So you just asymmetrically optimize these things</p>
<p>and then you can begin the conversation.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s where my book comes in place.</p>
<p>You just sort of slide it across the desk.</p>
<p>Buy the book and just leave it, give it to everybody</p>
<p>on your team.</p>
<p>Okay, so we solved the bulk of the email problem with this.</p>
<p>Is there a case to be made that even for communication</p>
<p>between you and I, we should move away from email?</p>
<p>And for example, there&rsquo;s a guy, I recently,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know comedians,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a guy named Joey Diaz</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve had an interaction with recently.</p>
<p>And that guy, first of all, the sweetest human,</p>
<p>despite what his comedy sounds like,</p>
<p>is the sweetest human being.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a big proponent of just pick up the phone and call.</p>
<p>And it makes me so uncomfortable when people call me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know what to do with this thing.</p>
<p>But it kind of gets everything done quicker, I think,</p>
<p>if I remove the anxiety from that.</p>
<p>Is there a case to be made for that?</p>
<p>Or is email could still be the most efficient way</p>
<p>to do this?</p>
<p>No, look, if you have to interact with someone,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of efficiency and synchrony, right?</p>
<p>And this is something from distributed system theory</p>
<p>where you know if you go from synchronous</p>
<p>to asynchronous networks,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a huge amount of overhead to the asynchrony.</p>
<p>So actually the protocols required to solve things</p>
<p>in asynchronous networks are significantly more complicated</p>
<p>and fragile than synchronous protocols.</p>
<p>So if we can just do real time, it&rsquo;s usually better.</p>
<p>And also from an interaction,</p>
<p>like social connection standpoint,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot more information in the human voice</p>
<p>and the back and forth.</p>
<p>Yeah, if you just call, so very generational, right?</p>
<p>Our generation will be comfortable talking on the phone</p>
<p>in a way that a younger generation isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but an older generation is more comfortable</p>
<p>with, well, you just call people.</p>
<p>Whereas we, so there&rsquo;s a happy medium,</p>
<p>but most of my good friends, we just talk,</p>
<p>we have regular phone calls.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not, I don&rsquo;t just call them,</p>
<p>we schedule it, we schedule it, yeah.</p>
<p>Just on text, like, yeah, you wanna talk sometime soon.</p>
<p>Do you ever have a process around friends?</p>
<p>Not really, no.</p>
<p>I feel like I should, I feel like.</p>
<p>Well, you have like a lot</p>
<p>of interesting friend possibilities.</p>
<p>You have like an interesting problem, right?</p>
<p>Like really interesting people you can talk to.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s one problem.</p>
<p>The other one is the introversion</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m just afraid of people and get really stressed.</p>
<p>Like I freak out.</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>You picked a good line of work.</p>
<p>Yeah, now perhaps it&rsquo;s the Goggins thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like facing your fears or whatever,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s almost like there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it has to do with the timetables thing and the deep work</p>
<p>that the nice thing about the processes</p>
<p>is it not only automates sort of,</p>
<p>automates away the context switching,</p>
<p>it ensures you do the important things too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like prioritize.</p>
<p>So the thing is with email,</p>
<p>because everything is done over email,</p>
<p>you can be lazy in the same way with like social networks</p>
<p>and do the easy things first that are not that important.</p>
<p>So the process also enforces</p>
<p>that you do the important things.</p>
<p>And for me, the important things is like,</p>
<p>okay, that sounds weird, but like social connection.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s one of the most important things</p>
<p>in all of human existence.</p>
<p>And doing it, the paradoxical thing,</p>
<p>I got into this for digital minimalism,</p>
<p>the more you sacrifice on behalf of the connection,</p>
<p>the stronger the connection feels, right?</p>
<p>So sacrificing non trivial time and attention</p>
<p>on behalf of someone is what tells your brain</p>
<p>that this is a serious relationship,</p>
<p>which is why social media had this paradoxical effect</p>
<p>making people feel less social</p>
<p>because it took the friction out of it.</p>
<p>And so the brain just doesn&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>like, yeah, you&rsquo;ve been commenting on this person&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>whatever, you&rsquo;ve been retweeting them</p>
<p>or sending them some text.</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s not hard enough.</p>
<p>And then the perceived strength</p>
<p>of that social connection diminishes</p>
<p>where if you talk to them or go spend time with them</p>
<p>or whatever, you&rsquo;re gonna feel better about it.</p>
<p>So the friction is good.</p>
<p>I have a thing with some of my friends</p>
<p>where at the end of each call,</p>
<p>we take a couple minutes to schedule the next.</p>
<p>Then you never have to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like I do with haircuts or something, right?</p>
<p>Like if I don&rsquo;t schedule it then,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m never gonna get my haircut, right?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like, okay, when do you wanna talk next?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a really good idea.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t call friends.</p>
<p>And like every 10 years I do something dramatic for them</p>
<p>so that we maintain the friendship.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;d murder somebody that they really don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Careful, man, Joey might ask you to do that.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s why, that&rsquo;s one of my favorite things.</p>
<p>Lex, I need you to come down to New Jersey.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;re gonna do.</p>
<p>With that robot dog of yours.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna go down to New Jersey.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a special human.</p>
<p>I love the comedian world.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been shaking up.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you listen to Joe Rogan, all those folks.</p>
<p>They kind of are doing something interesting</p>
<p>for MIT and academia.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re shaking up this world a little bit.</p>
<p>Like podcasting, because comedians are paving the way</p>
<p>for podcasting.</p>
<p>And so you have like Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a neuroscientist at Stanford, friend of mine now.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like into podcasting now and you&rsquo;re into podcasting.</p>
<p>Of course, you&rsquo;re not necessarily podcasting</p>
<p>about computer science currently, right?</p>
<p>But that, it feels like you could have a lot</p>
<p>of the free spirit of the comedians implemented</p>
<p>by the people who are academically trained.</p>
<p>Who actually have a niche specialty.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then that results, I mean,</p>
<p>who knows what the experiment looks like,</p>
<p>but that results me being able to talk about robotics</p>
<p>with Joey Diaz when he says, you know,</p>
<p>drops F bombs every other sentence.</p>
<p>And I, the world is like, I&rsquo;ve seen actually a shift</p>
<p>within colleagues and friends within MIT</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re becoming much more accepting</p>
<p>of that kind of thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re seeing, okay.</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re seeing how popular it is.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, wait a minute.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re really popular.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how they think about it</p>
<p>at Georgetown, for example.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, but I think what happens</p>
<p>is the popularity of it combined</p>
<p>with just good conversations with people they respect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, wait, this is the thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And this is more fun to listen to</p>
<p>than a shitty Zoom lecture about their work.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s something here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something interesting.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t, nobody actually knows what that is.</p>
<p>Just like with like Clubhouse or something,</p>
<p>nobody&rsquo;s figured out like, where does this medium take?</p>
<p>Is this a legitimate medium of education?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Or is this just like a fun?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s your innovation, I think,</p>
<p>was we can bring on professors.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I know Joe Rogan did some of that too,</p>
<p>but your professors in your field.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>You bring on all these MIT guys who I remember.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s been the big challenge for me is,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, is I feel,</p>
<p>I would ask big like philosophical questions</p>
<p>of people like yourself.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like really well public.</p>
<p>Like, so for example, you have a lot of excellent papers</p>
<p>on, you know, that has a lot of theory in it, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some temptation to just go through papers.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s possible to actually do that.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t done that much, but I think it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>It just requires a lot of preparation.</p>
<p>And I can probably only do that with things</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m actually like in the field I&rsquo;m aware of.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a dance that I would love to be able</p>
<p>to try to hit right where it&rsquo;s actually getting</p>
<p>to the core of some interesting ideas</p>
<p>as opposed to just talking about philosophy.</p>
<p>At the same time, there&rsquo;s a large audience of people</p>
<p>that just want to be inspired by disciplines</p>
<p>where they don&rsquo;t necessarily know the details.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot of people that are like,</p>
<p>hmm, I&rsquo;m really curious.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about pivoting careers</p>
<p>into software engineering.</p>
<p>They would love to hear from people like you</p>
<p>about computer science.</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s like theory.</p>
<p>Yeah, but just like the idea that you can have big ideas,</p>
<p>you push them through and it&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>you fight for it, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s some, there&rsquo;s what is it?</p>
<p>Computerphile and Numberphile, these YouTube channels.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s channels I watch on like chess, exceptionally popular</p>
<p>where I don&rsquo;t understand maybe 80% of the time</p>
<p>what the hell they&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re talking about like why this move</p>
<p>is better than this move.</p>
<p>But I love the passion and the genius of those people</p>
<p>and just overhearing it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why that&rsquo;s so exciting.</p>
<p>Do you look at like Scott Aaronson&rsquo;s blog at all?</p>
<p>The Settled, Optimized?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like hardcore complexity theory.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just an enthusiasm or like Terry Tao&rsquo;s blog.</p>
<p>A little bit of humor about it.</p>
<p>Terry Tao has a blog?</p>
<p>He used to, yeah.</p>
<p>And it would just be, I&rsquo;m going all in on,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a new affine group with which you can do whatever.</p>
<p>Whatever, it was just equations.</p>
<p>Well, in the case of Scott Aaronson,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s good, he&rsquo;s able to turn on like the inner troll</p>
<p>and comedian and so on.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He keeps the fun, which is the best</p>
<p>of kinds of books. And he&rsquo;s a philosophical guy.</p>
<p>He wrote that.</p>
<p>He turns on the philosophy. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we&rsquo;re exploring these different ways</p>
<p>of communicating science and exciting the world.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I gotta ask you about computer science.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right, I do some of that.</p>
<p>So, I mean, a lot of your work is what inspired</p>
<p>this deep thinking about productivity</p>
<p>from all the different angles,</p>
<p>because some of the most rigorous work</p>
<p>is mathematical work.</p>
<p>And in computer science, the theoretical computer science,</p>
<p>let me ask the Scott Aaronson question of like,</p>
<p>is there something to you that stands out in particular</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s beautiful or inspiring,</p>
<p>or just really insightful about computer science</p>
<p>or maybe mathematics?</p>
<p>I mean, I like theory.</p>
<p>And in particular, what I&rsquo;ve always liked in theory</p>
<p>is the notion of impossibilities.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of my specialty.</p>
<p>So within the context of distributed algorithms,</p>
<p>my specialty is impossibility results.</p>
<p>So the idea that you can argue</p>
<p>nothing exists that solves this,</p>
<p>or nothing exists that can solve this faster than this.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>And that goes all the way back to Turing.</p>
<p>His original paper on computable numbers</p>
<p>with their connection to the German Eichsturzungen problem,</p>
<p>but basically the German name</p>
<p>that Hilbert called the decision problem.</p>
<p>This was precomputers, but he&rsquo;s English,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s written in English.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very accessible paper.</p>
<p>And it lays the foundation</p>
<p>for all of theoretical computer science.</p>
<p>He just has this insight.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, well, if we think about like an algorithm,</p>
<p>I mean, he figures out like all effective procedures</p>
<p>or Turing machines are basically algorithms.</p>
<p>We could really describe a Turing machine with a number,</p>
<p>which we can now imagine with like computer code,</p>
<p>you could just take a source file</p>
<p>and just treat the binary version of the file</p>
<p>as like a really long number, right?</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s like, every program is just a finite number.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a natural number.</p>
<p>And then he realized like one way to think about a problem</p>
<p>is you have, and this is like kind of the Mike Sipser</p>
<p>approach, but you have a sort of, it&rsquo;s a language.</p>
<p>So of an infinite number of strings,</p>
<p>some of them are in the language and some of them aren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but basically you can imagine a problem is represented</p>
<p>as an infinite binary string,</p>
<p>where in every position, like a one means that string</p>
<p>is in the language and a zero means it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And then he applied Cantor from the 19th century and said,</p>
<p>okay, the natural numbers are countable.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s countably infinite and infinite binary strings,</p>
<p>you can use a diagonalization argument</p>
<p>and show they&rsquo;re uncountable.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s just vastly more problems</p>
<p>than there are algorithms.</p>
<p>So basically anything you can come up with for the most part</p>
<p>almost certainly is not solvable by a computer.</p>
<p>And then he was like, let me give a particular example.</p>
<p>And he figured out the very first computability proof.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just walk through with a little bit of simple logic</p>
<p>to halting problem can&rsquo;t be solved by an algorithm.</p>
<p>And that kicked off the whole enterprise</p>
<p>of some things can&rsquo;t be solved by algorithms,</p>
<p>some things can&rsquo;t be solved by computers.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve just been doing theory on that</p>
<p>since that was the 30s he wrote that.</p>
<p>So proving that something is impossible</p>
<p>is sort of a stricter version of that.</p>
<p>Is it like proving bounds on the performance</p>
<p>of different algorithms?</p>
<p>Yeah, so bounds are upper bounds, right?</p>
<p>So you say, this algorithm does at least this well</p>
<p>and no worse than this,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re looking at a particular algorithm</p>
<p>and possibility proof say no algorithm ever</p>
<p>could ever solve this problem.</p>
<p>So no algorithm could ever solve the halting problem.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s problem centric.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s making something different,</p>
<p>making a conclusive statement about the problem.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s somehow satisfying because it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just philosophically interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it all goes back to, you get back to Plato,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all reductio ad absurdum.</p>
<p>So all these arguments have to start.</p>
<p>The only way to do it</p>
<p>is because there&rsquo;s an infinite number of solutions</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t go through them.</p>
<p>You say, let&rsquo;s assume for the sake of contradiction</p>
<p>that there existed something that solves this problem.</p>
<p>And then you turn to crank a logic</p>
<p>until you blow up the universe.</p>
<p>And then you go back and say,</p>
<p>okay, our original assumption</p>
<p>that this solution exists can&rsquo;t be true.</p>
<p>I just think philosophically,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a really exciting kind of beautiful thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what I specialize in within distributed algorithms</p>
<p>is more like time bound and possibility results.</p>
<p>Like no algorithm can solve this problem faster than this</p>
<p>in this setting.</p>
<p>Of all the infinite number of ways you might ever do it.</p>
<p>So you have many papers,</p>
<p>but the one that caught my eye</p>
<p>is Smooth Analysis of Dynamic Networks,</p>
<p>in which you write,</p>
<p>a problem with the worst case perspective</p>
<p>is that it often leads to extremely strong lower bounds.</p>
<p>These strong results motivate a key question.</p>
<p>Is this bond robust in the sense</p>
<p>that it captures the fundamental difficulty</p>
<p>introduced by dynamism?</p>
<p>Or is the bond fragile in the sense</p>
<p>that the poor performance it describes</p>
<p>depends on an exact sequence of adversarial changes.</p>
<p>Fragile lower bounds leave open the possibility</p>
<p>of algorithms that might still perform well in practice.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in the sense of the impossible</p>
<p>and the bounds discussion presents the interesting question.</p>
<p>I just like the idea of robust and fragile bounds,</p>
<p>but what do you make about this kind of tension</p>
<p>between what&rsquo;s provably,</p>
<p>like what bounds you can prove that are like robust</p>
<p>and something that&rsquo;s a bit more fragile.</p>
<p>And also by way of answering that</p>
<p>for this particular paper,</p>
<p>can you say what the hell are dynamic networks?</p>
<p>What are distributed algorithms?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know this?</p>
<p>Come on now.</p>
<p>And I have no idea.</p>
<p>And what is Smooth Analysis?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, okay.</p>
<p>So Smooth Analysis, so it wasn&rsquo;t my idea.</p>
<p>So Spielman and Tang came up with this</p>
<p>in the context of sequential algorithms.</p>
<p>So just like the normal world of an algorithm</p>
<p>that runs on a computer.</p>
<p>And they were looking at, there&rsquo;s a well known algorithm</p>
<p>called the simplex algorithm,</p>
<p>but basically you&rsquo;re trying to find a hole</p>
<p>around a group of points.</p>
<p>And there was an algorithm</p>
<p>that worked really well in practice.</p>
<p>But when you analyze it, you would say,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t guarantee it&rsquo;s gonna work well in practice</p>
<p>because if you have just the right inputs,</p>
<p>this thing could run really long.</p>
<p>But in practice, it seemed to be really fast.</p>
<p>So Smooth Analysis is they came in and they said,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s assume that a bad guy chooses the inputs.</p>
<p>It could be anything like really bad ones.</p>
<p>And all we&rsquo;re gonna do, because in simplex they&rsquo;re numbers,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna just randomly put a little bit of noise</p>
<p>on each of the numbers.</p>
<p>And they said, if you put a little bit of noise</p>
<p>on the numbers, suddenly simplex algorithm goes really fast.</p>
<p>Like, oh, that explains this lower bound,</p>
<p>this idea that it could sometimes run really long</p>
<p>was a fragile bound because it could only run</p>
<p>a really long time if you had exactly</p>
<p>the worst pathological input.</p>
<p>So then my collaborators and I brought this over</p>
<p>to the world of distributed algorithms.</p>
<p>We brought them over the general lower bounds, right?</p>
<p>So in the world of dynamic networks,</p>
<p>so distributed algorithm is a bunch of algorithms</p>
<p>on different machines talking to each other,</p>
<p>trying to solve a problem.</p>
<p>And sometimes they&rsquo;re in a network.</p>
<p>So you imagine them connected with network links</p>
<p>and a dynamic network, those can change, right?</p>
<p>So I was talking to you, but now I can&rsquo;t talk to you anymore.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m connected to a person over here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really hard environment mathematically speaking.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of really strong lower bounds,</p>
<p>which you could imagine if the network can change</p>
<p>all the time and a bad guy is doing it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like hard to do things well.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an algorithm running on every single node</p>
<p>in the network.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re trying to say something of any kind</p>
<p>that makes any kind of definitive sense</p>
<p>about the performance of that algorithm.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I just submitted a new paper on this</p>
<p>a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>And we were looking at a very simple problem.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some messages in the network.</p>
<p>We want everyone to get them.</p>
<p>If the network doesn&rsquo;t change,</p>
<p>you can do this pretty well.</p>
<p>You can pipeline them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some basic algorithms that work really well.</p>
<p>If the network can change every round,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s these lower bounds that says,</p>
<p>it takes a really long time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a way that no matter what algorithm you come up with,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a way the network can change in such a way</p>
<p>that just really slows down your progress basically, right?</p>
<p>So smooth analysis there says, yeah,</p>
<p>but that seems like you&rsquo;d have really bad luck</p>
<p>if your network was changing exactly in the right way</p>
<p>that you needed to screw your algorithm.</p>
<p>So we said, what if we randomly just add</p>
<p>or remove a couple of edges in every round?</p>
<p>So the adversary is trying to choose</p>
<p>the worst possible network.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re just tweaking it a little bit.</p>
<p>And in that case, this is a new paper.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a blinded submission,</p>
<p>so maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s not, whatever.</p>
<p>We basically showed.</p>
<p>An anonymous friend of yours submitted a paper.</p>
<p>An anonymous friend of mine, yeah,</p>
<p>whose paper should be accepted.</p>
<p>Showed that even just adding like one random edge per round,</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s the cool thing about it,</p>
<p>the simplest possible solution to this problem</p>
<p>blows away that lower bound and does really well.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like a very fragile lower bound</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re like, it&rsquo;s almost impossible</p>
<p>to actually keep things slow.</p>
<p>I wonder how many lower bounds you can smash open</p>
<p>with this kind of analysis and show that they&rsquo;re fragile.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my interest, yeah.</p>
<p>Because in distributed algorithms,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a ton of really famous strong lower bounds,</p>
<p>but things have to go wrong, really, really wrong</p>
<p>for these lower bound arguments to work.</p>
<p>And so I like this approach.</p>
<p>So this whole notion of fragile versus robust,</p>
<p>I was like, well, let&rsquo;s go in and just throw</p>
<p>a little noise in there.</p>
<p>And if it becomes solvable, then maybe that lower bound</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t really something we should worry about.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s gonna embarrass,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really uncomfortable.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really embarrassing to a lot of people.</p>
<p>Because, okay, this is the OCD thing with the spaces,</p>
<p>is it feels really good when you can prove a nice bound.</p>
<p>And if you say that that bound is fragile,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s gonna be a sad kid</p>
<p>that walks with their lunchbox back home,</p>
<p>like, my lower bound doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think they care.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all, I don&rsquo;t know, it feels like to me,</p>
<p>a lot of this theory is just math machismo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, whatever, this was a hard bound to prove.</p>
<p>What do you think about that?</p>
<p>So if you show that something is fragile,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really important in practice, right?</p>
<p>So do you think kind of theoretical computer science</p>
<p>is living its own world, just like mathematics,</p>
<p>and their main effort, which I think is very valuable,</p>
<p>is to develop ideas that&rsquo;s not necessarily interesting,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s applicable in the real world.</p>
<p>Yeah, we don&rsquo;t care about the applicability.</p>
<p>Yeah, we kind of do, but not really.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re terrible with computers,</p>
<p>and can&rsquo;t do anything useful with computers,</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t know how to code.</p>
<p>And, you know, we&rsquo;re not productive members</p>
<p>of like technological society,</p>
<p>but I do think things percolate.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>You percolate from the world of theory</p>
<p>into the world of algorithm design,</p>
<p>where it will pull on the theory,</p>
<p>and now suddenly it&rsquo;s useful,</p>
<p>and then the algorithm design</p>
<p>gets pulled into the world of practice,</p>
<p>where they say, well, actually,</p>
<p>we can make this algorithm a lot better,</p>
<p>because in practice, really, these servers do X, Y, Z,</p>
<p>and now we can make this super efficient.</p>
<p>And so I do think, I mean, I teach theory</p>
<p>to the PhD students at Georgetown.</p>
<p>I show them the sort of funnel of like,</p>
<p>okay, we&rsquo;re over here doing theory,</p>
<p>but it eventually, some of this stuff</p>
<p>will percolate down in effect at the very end, you know,</p>
<p>a phone, but it&rsquo;s a long tunnel.</p>
<p>But the very question you&rsquo;re asking,</p>
<p>at the highest philosophical level, is fascinating.</p>
<p>Like, if you take a system, a distributed system,</p>
<p>or a network, and introduce a little bit of noise into it,</p>
<p>like, how many problems of that nature</p>
<p>are fundamentally changed</p>
<p>by that little introduction of noise?</p>
<p>Yeah, because it&rsquo;s all,</p>
<p>especially in distributed algorithms,</p>
<p>the model is everything.</p>
<p>Like, the way we work is we&rsquo;re incredibly precise about,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s exactly, it&rsquo;s mathematical,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s exactly how the network works,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a state machine, algorithms are state machines,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s rounds and schedulers,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re super precise so we can prove lower bounds.</p>
<p>But yeah, often those lower,</p>
<p>those impossibility results really get at the hard edges</p>
<p>of exactly how that model works.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll see if this, so we published a paper on this,</p>
<p>that paper you mentioned,</p>
<p>that kind of introduced the idea</p>
<p>to the distributed algorithms world.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s got some traction</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s been some followup.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve just submitted our next.</p>
<p>I mean, honestly, the issue with the next</p>
<p>that like the result fell out so easily,</p>
<p>and this shows the mathematical machismo problem</p>
<p>in these fields is there&rsquo;s a good chance</p>
<p>the paper won&rsquo;t be accepted</p>
<p>because there wasn&rsquo;t enough mathematical self flagellation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such a nice finding.</p>
<p>So even showing that very few,</p>
<p>just very little bit of noise,</p>
<p>can have a dramatic, make a dramatic statement about the.</p>
<p>It was a big surprise to us,</p>
<p>but once we figured out how to show it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not too hard.</p>
<p>And these are venues for theoretical work.</p>
<p>Okay, so the fascinating tension</p>
<p>that exists in other disciplines,</p>
<p>like one of them is machine learning,</p>
<p>which despite the power of machine learning</p>
<p>and deep learning and all like the impact of it,</p>
<p>in the real world,</p>
<p>the main conferences on machine learning</p>
<p>are still resistant to application papers.</p>
<p>And application papers broadly defined,</p>
<p>meaning like finding almost like you would,</p>
<p>like Darwin did by like going around,</p>
<p>collecting some information,</p>
<p>saying, huh, isn&rsquo;t this interesting?</p>
<p>Like those are some of the most popular blogs,</p>
<p>and yet as a paper, it&rsquo;s not really accepted.</p>
<p>I wonder what you think about this whole world</p>
<p>of deep learning from a perspective of theory.</p>
<p>What do you make of this whole discipline</p>
<p>of the success of Neon Networks,</p>
<p>of how to do science on them?</p>
<p>Are you excited by the possibilities</p>
<p>of what we might discover about Neon Networks?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s fundamental in engineering discipline,</p>
<p>or is there something theoretical</p>
<p>that we might crack open one of these days</p>
<p>in understanding something deep</p>
<p>about how system optimization and how systems learn?</p>
<p>I am convinced by, is it Tegmark at MIT?</p>
<p>Tegmark? Yeah, Tegmark, right.</p>
<p>So his notion has always been convincing to me</p>
<p>that the fact that some of these models are inscrutable</p>
<p>is not fundamental to them,</p>
<p>and that we can, we&rsquo;re gonna get better and better,</p>
<p>because in the end, you know,</p>
<p>the reason why practicing computer scientists often</p>
<p>who are doing AI or working at AI and industry</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t like worried about so much existential threats</p>
<p>is because they see the reality</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;re multiplying matrices with NumPy</p>
<p>or something like this, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, and tweaking constants</p>
<p>and hoping that the classifier fitness,</p>
<p>for God&rsquo;s sakes, before the submission deadline</p>
<p>actually gets above some,</p>
<p>it feels like it&rsquo;s linear algebra and tedium, right?</p>
<p>But anyways, I&rsquo;m really convinced with his idea</p>
<p>that once we understand better and better</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on from a theory perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna make it into an engineering discipline.</p>
<p>So in my mind, where we&rsquo;re gonna end up is,</p>
<p>okay, forget these metaphors of neurons,</p>
<p>and these things are gonna be put down</p>
<p>into these mathematical kind of elegant equations,</p>
<p>differentiable equations that just kind of work well,</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>when I need a little bit of AI in this thing, plumbing.</p>
<p>Like, let&rsquo;s get a little bit of a pattern recognizer</p>
<p>with a noise module and let&rsquo;s connect.</p>
<p>I mean, you know this feel better than me,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t know if this is like a reasonable prediction,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s gonna become less inscrutable,</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s gonna become more engineerable,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re gonna have AI in more things</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re gonna have a little bit more control</p>
<p>over how we piece together</p>
<p>these different classification black boxes.</p>
<p>So one of the problems, and there might be</p>
<p>some interesting parallels that you might provide intuition</p>
<p>on is, you know, neural networks are very large,</p>
<p>and they have a lot of, you know,</p>
<p>we were talking about, you know, dynamic networks</p>
<p>and distributed algorithms.</p>
<p>One of the problems with the analysis of neural networks</p>
<p>is, you know, you have a lot of nodes,</p>
<p>and you have a lot of edges.</p>
<p>To be able to interpret and to control different things</p>
<p>is very difficult.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s fields in trying to figure out like mathematically</p>
<p>how you form clean representations that are like,</p>
<p>like one node contains all the information</p>
<p>about a particular thing,</p>
<p>and no other nodes is correlated to it.</p>
<p>So like it has unique knowledge and like,</p>
<p>but that ultimately boils down to trying</p>
<p>to simplify this thing into,</p>
<p>that goes against this very nature,</p>
<p>which is like deeply connected,</p>
<p>and like dynamic and just, you know,</p>
<p>hundreds of millions, billions of nodes.</p>
<p>And in a distributed sense, like when you zoom out,</p>
<p>the thing has a representation</p>
<p>and understanding of something,</p>
<p>but the individual nodes are just doing</p>
<p>their little exchanging thing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the same thing with Stephen Wolfram</p>
<p>when you talk about cellular automata,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult to do math</p>
<p>when you have a huge collection of distributed things,</p>
<p>each acting on their own.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost like, it feels like it&rsquo;s almost impossible</p>
<p>to do any kind of theoretical work in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>It almost becomes completely like a biology,</p>
<p>you become a biologist as opposed to a theoretician.</p>
<p>You just study it experimentally.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s the big question, I guess, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, so is the large size and interconnectedness</p>
<p>of the like a deep learning network fundamental</p>
<p>to that task, or are we just not very good at it yet</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re using the wrong metaphor?</p>
<p>I mean, the human brain learns with much fewer examples</p>
<p>and with much less tuning of the whatever, whatever,</p>
<p>whatever probably that requires to get</p>
<p>those like deep mind networks up and running.</p>
<p>But yeah, so I don&rsquo;t really know,</p>
<p>but the one thing I have observed is that the, yeah,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the mundane nature of some of the working</p>
<p>with these models tends to lead people to think that,</p>
<p>to do it like, it could be Skynet</p>
<p>or it could be like a lot of pain to get the thermostat</p>
<p>to do what we want it to do.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of open questions in between there.</p>
<p>And then of course, the distributed network</p>
<p>of humans that use these systems.</p>
<p>So like you can have the system itself,</p>
<p>then your network, but you can also have like little</p>
<p>algorithms controlling the behavior of humans,</p>
<p>which is what you have with social networks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that a very, what is it, a toaster or whatever,</p>
<p>the opposite of Skynet when taken at scale</p>
<p>while used by individual humans and controlling</p>
<p>their behavior can actually have the Skynet effect.</p>
<p>So the scale there.</p>
<p>We might have that now.</p>
<p>We might have that now, we just don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>As it&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Is Twitter creating a little mini Skynet?</p>
<p>I mean, because of what happens,</p>
<p>it twirls out ramifications in the world.</p>
<p>And is it really that much different if it&rsquo;s a robot</p>
<p>with tentacles or a bunch of servers that.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the destructive effects could be,</p>
<p>I mean, it could be political, but it could also be like,</p>
<p>you could probably make an interesting case that the virus,</p>
<p>the coronavirus spread on Twitter too,</p>
<p>in the minds of people.</p>
<p>Like the fear and the misinformation</p>
<p>in some very interesting ways mixed up.</p>
<p>And maybe this pandemic wasn&rsquo;t sufficiently dangerous</p>
<p>to where that could have created a weird like an instability,</p>
<p>but maybe other things might create instability.</p>
<p>Like somebody, God forbid,</p>
<p>detonates a nuclear weapon somewhere.</p>
<p>And then maybe the destructive aspect of that</p>
<p>would not as much be the military actions,</p>
<p>but the way those news are spread on Twitter</p>
<p>and the panic that creates.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that&rsquo;s a great case study, right?</p>
<p>Like what happened, not,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not suggesting that Lexi go let off a nuclear bomb.</p>
<p>I meant the coronavirus, but yeah,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a really interesting case study.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in the counterfactual of 1995,</p>
<p>like do the same virus in 1995.</p>
<p>So first of all, it would have been,</p>
<p>I get to hear whatever the nightly news,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk about it.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;ll be my local health board,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk about it.</p>
<p>That mitigation decisions would probably necessarily be</p>
<p>very sort of localized.</p>
<p>Okay, our community is trying to figure out</p>
<p>what are we gonna do?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s gonna happen?</p>
<p>Like we see this with schools,</p>
<p>like where I grew up in New Jersey,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s very localized school districts.</p>
<p>So even though they had sort of</p>
<p>really bad viral numbers there,</p>
<p>my school I grew up in has been open since the fall</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very localized.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like these teachers and these parents,</p>
<p>what do we wanna do?</p>
<p>What are we comfortable with?</p>
<p>I live in a school district right now in Montgomery County</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a billion dollar a year budget,</p>
<p>150,000 kid school district.</p>
<p>It just can&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s closed because it&rsquo;s too.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m interested in that counterfactual.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you have all this information moving around</p>
<p>and then you have the effects on discourse</p>
<p>that we were talking about earlier,</p>
<p>that the Neil Postman style effects of Twitter,</p>
<p>which shifts people into a sort of a dunk culture mindset</p>
<p>of don&rsquo;t give an inch to the other team.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re used to this and was fired up by politics</p>
<p>and the unique attributes of Twitter.</p>
<p>Now throw in the coronavirus</p>
<p>and suddenly we see decades of public health knowledge,</p>
<p>a lot of which was honed during the HIV epidemic,</p>
<p>was thrown out the window</p>
<p>because a lot of this was happening on Twitter</p>
<p>and suddenly we had public health officials</p>
<p>using a don&rsquo;t give an inch to the other team mindset</p>
<p>of like, well, if we say this,</p>
<p>that might validate something that was wrong over here</p>
<p>and we need to, if we say this,</p>
<p>then maybe like that&rsquo;ll stop them from doing this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like very Twittery in a way that in 1995</p>
<p>is probably not the way public health officials</p>
<p>would be thinking.</p>
<p>Where now it&rsquo;s like, well, this is,</p>
<p>if we said this about masks,</p>
<p>but the other team said that about masks,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t give an inch to this.</p>
<p>So we gotta be careful.</p>
<p>And like, we can&rsquo;t tell people it&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>after they&rsquo;re vaccinated because that might,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re giving them an inch on this</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s very Twittery in my mind, right?</p>
<p>That is the impact of Twitter</p>
<p>on the way we think about discourse,</p>
<p>which is a dunking culture</p>
<p>of don&rsquo;t give any inch to the other team</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all about slam dunks</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re completely right and they&rsquo;re completely wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as a rhetorical strategy, it&rsquo;s incredibly simplistic,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also the way that we think right now</p>
<p>about how we do debate.</p>
<p>It combined terribly with election year pandemic.</p>
<p>Yeah, election year pandemic.</p>
<p>I wonder if we could do some smooth analysis.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s run the simulation over a few times.</p>
<p>A little bit of noise, yeah.</p>
<p>See if it can dramatically change</p>
<p>the behavior of the system.</p>
<p>Okay, we talked about your love</p>
<p>for proving that something is impossible.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s quite a few still open problems</p>
<p>and complexity of algorithms.</p>
<p>So let me ask, does P equal NP?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>If P equals NP, what kind of,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d be really surprised somebody proves it.</p>
<p>What would that proof look like</p>
<p>and why would that even be?</p>
<p>What would that mean?</p>
<p>What would that proof look like?</p>
<p>And what possible universe could P equals NP?</p>
<p>Is there something in size that you could say there?</p>
<p>It could be true.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not a complexity theorist,</p>
<p>but every complexity theorist I know</p>
<p>is convinced they&rsquo;re not equal</p>
<p>and are basically not working on it anymore.</p>
<p>I mean, there is a million dollars at stake</p>
<p>if you can solve the proof.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the millennium prizes.</p>
<p>Okay, so here&rsquo;s how I think the P not equals NP proof</p>
<p>is gonna eventually happen.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gonna fall out</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna be not super simple,</p>
<p>but not as hard as people think,</p>
<p>because my theory about a lot of theoretical computer science</p>
<p>based on just some results I&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>so this is a huge extrapolation,</p>
<p>is that a lot of what we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>is just obfuscating deeper mathematics.</p>
<p>So this happens to me a lot, not a lot,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s happened to me a few times in my work</p>
<p>where we obfuscate it because we say,</p>
<p>well, there&rsquo;s an algorithm and it has this much memory</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re connected on a network</p>
<p>and okay, here&rsquo;s our setup</p>
<p>and now we&rsquo;re trying to see how fast it can solve a problem</p>
<p>and people do bounds about it</p>
<p>and then the end it turns out</p>
<p>that we were just obfuscating some underlying</p>
<p>mathematical thing that already existed, right?</p>
<p>So this has happened to me.</p>
<p>I had this paper I was quite fond of a while ago.</p>
<p>It was looking at this problem called contention resolution</p>
<p>where you put an unknown set of people on a shared channel</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re trying to break symmetry.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like an ethernet, whatever.</p>
<p>Only one person can use it at a time.</p>
<p>You try to break symmetry.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all these bounds people have proven over the years</p>
<p>about how long it takes to do this, right?</p>
<p>And like I discovered at some point,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this one combinatorial result from the early 1990s.</p>
<p>All of these lower bound proofs all come from this</p>
<p>and in fact, it improved a lot of them</p>
<p>and simplified a lot.</p>
<p>You could put it all in one paper.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, are we really?</p>
<p>And then, okay, so this new paper</p>
<p>that I submitted a couple of weeks ago,</p>
<p>I found you could take some of these same lower bound proofs</p>
<p>for this contention resolution problem.</p>
<p>You could reprove them.</p>
<p>Using Shannon&rsquo;s source code theorem</p>
<p>that actually when you&rsquo;re breaking contention,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re really doing is building a code over,</p>
<p>if you have a distribution on the network sizes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a code over that source.</p>
<p>And if you plug in a high entropy information source</p>
<p>and plug in from 1948, the source code theorem</p>
<p>that says on a noiseless channel,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t send things at a faster rate</p>
<p>than the entropy allows,</p>
<p>the exact same lower bounds fall back out again, right?</p>
<p>So like this type of thing happens.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some famous lower bounds and distributed algorithms</p>
<p>that turned out to all be algebraic topology</p>
<p>underneath the covers.</p>
<p>And they won the Girdle Prize for working on that.</p>
<p>So my sense is what&rsquo;s gonna happen is at some point,</p>
<p>someone really smart to be very exciting</p>
<p>is gonna realize there&rsquo;s some sort of other representation</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s going on with these Turing machines</p>
<p>trying to sort of efficiently compute.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;ll be an existing mathematical result</p>
<p>that apply.</p>
<p>Someone or something, I guess.</p>
<p>It could be AI theorem provers kind of thing.</p>
<p>It could be, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, not a, well, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s theorem provers,</p>
<p>like what that means now, which is not fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a bunch of&hellip;</p>
<p>Very carefully formulated postulates that,</p>
<p>but I take your point, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so, okay.</p>
<p>On a small tangent on that,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re kind of implying that mathematics,</p>
<p>it almost feels like a kind of weird evolutionary tree</p>
<p>that ultimately leads back to some kind of ancestral,</p>
<p>few fundamental ideas that all are just like,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all somehow connected.</p>
<p>In that sense, do you think</p>
<p>math is fundamental to our universe</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just like slowly trying to understand</p>
<p>these patterns or is it discovered?</p>
<p>Or is it just a little game that we play amongst ourselves</p>
<p>to try to fit little patterns to the world?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the question, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the physicist question.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m probably, I&rsquo;m in the discovered camp,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t do theoretical physics.</p>
<p>So I know they have a,</p>
<p>they feel like they have a stronger claim</p>
<p>to answering that question.</p>
<p>But everything comes back to it.</p>
<p>Everything comes back to it.</p>
<p>I mean, all the physics,</p>
<p>the fact that the universe is, well, okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complicated question.</p>
<p>So how often do you think,</p>
<p>how deeply does this result describe</p>
<p>the fundamental reality of nature?</p>
<p>So the reason I hesitated,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m,</p>
<p>I taught this seminar and did a little work</p>
<p>on what are called biological algorithms.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this notion of,</p>
<p>so physicists use mathematics to explain the universe, right?</p>
<p>And it was unreasonable that mathematics works so well.</p>
<p>All these differential equations,</p>
<p>why does that explain all we need to know</p>
<p>about thermodynamics and gravity</p>
<p>and all these types of things?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s this movement</p>
<p>within the intersection of computer science and biology,</p>
<p>just kind of Wolframium, I guess, really,</p>
<p>that algorithms can be very explanatory, right?</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re trying to explain parsimoniously</p>
<p>something about like an ant colony or something like this,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to,</p>
<p>ultimately it&rsquo;s not gonna be explained as a equation,</p>
<p>like a physics equation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be explained by an algorithm.</p>
<p>So like this algorithm run distributedly</p>
<p>is going to explain the behavior.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s mathematical, but not quite mathematical,</p>
<p>but it is if you think about an algorithm</p>
<p>like a Lambda calculus,</p>
<p>which brings you back to the world of mathematics.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m thinking out loud here,</p>
<p>but basically abstract math is sort of like</p>
<p>unreasonably effective at explaining a lot of things.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just what I feel like I glimpse.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not like a super well known theoretician.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have really famous results.</p>
<p>So even as a sort of middling career theoretician,</p>
<p>I keep encountering this where we think we&rsquo;re solving</p>
<p>some problem about computers and algorithms,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s some much deeper underlying math.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Shannon, but Shannon is entropy,</p>
<p>but entropy was really goes all the way back</p>
<p>to whatever it was,</p>
<p>Boyle or all the way back to looking at the early physics.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, anyways, to me, I think it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it could be the flip side of that could be</p>
<p>just our brains draw so much pleasure</p>
<p>from the deriving generalized theories</p>
<p>and simplifying the universe that we just naturally see</p>
<p>that kind of simplicity in everything.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s the whole Newton to Einstein, right?</p>
<p>So you can say this must be right</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so predictive.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not quite predictive</p>
<p>because Mercury wobbles a little bit,</p>
<p>but I think we have it set</p>
<p>and then you turn out, no, Einstein.</p>
<p>And then you get Bohr like, no, not Einstein.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually statistical.</p>
<p>And yeah, so that would be interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to also know</p>
<p>where a smooth analysis fits into all that</p>
<p>or a little bit of noise.</p>
<p>Like you can say something very clean about a system</p>
<p>and then a little bit of noise,</p>
<p>like the average case is actually very different.</p>
<p>And so, I mean, that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>the quantum mechanics comes in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, ugh, why does it have to be randomness in this?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would have to do this complex statistics.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>So to be determined.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;ll be my next book.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be ambitious.</p>
<p>The fundamental core of reality, comma,</p>
<p>and some advice for being more productive at work.</p>
<p>Can I ask you just,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s possible to do an overview</p>
<p>and just some brief comments of wisdom</p>
<p>on the process of publishing a book,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that process entail?</p>
<p>What are the different options</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s your recommendation</p>
<p>for somebody that wants to write a book like yours,</p>
<p>a nonfiction book that discovers</p>
<p>something interesting about this world?</p>
<p>So what I usually advise is follow the process as is.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to reinvent.</p>
<p>I think that happens a lot where you&rsquo;ll try to reinvent</p>
<p>the way the publishing industry should work.</p>
<p>Like this is kind of not like in a business model ways,</p>
<p>but just like, this is what I want to do.</p>
<p>I want to write a thousand words a day</p>
<p>and I want to do this and I&rsquo;m gonna put it on the internet</p>
<p>and the publishing industry is very specific</p>
<p>about how it works.</p>
<p>And so like when I got started writing books,</p>
<p>which at a very young age,</p>
<p>so I sold my first book at the age of 21.</p>
<p>The way I did that is I found a family friend</p>
<p>that was an agent and I said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to make you be my agent.</p>
<p>Just explain to me how this works.</p>
<p>Not just how the world works,</p>
<p>but give me the hard truth about how would a 21 year old,</p>
<p>under what conditions could a 21 year old sell a book</p>
<p>and what would that look like?</p>
<p>And she just explained it to me.</p>
<p>You know, you have to do this and have to be a subject</p>
<p>that it made sense for you to write.</p>
<p>And you would have to do this type of writing</p>
<p>for the publications to validate it and blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>And you have to get the agent first.</p>
<p>And I learned the whole game plan and then I executed.</p>
<p>And so the rough game plan is with nonfiction,</p>
<p>you get the agent first</p>
<p>and the agent&rsquo;s gonna sell it to the publishers.</p>
<p>So like you&rsquo;re never sending something directly</p>
<p>to the publishers.</p>
<p>In nonfiction, you&rsquo;re not writing the book first, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get an advance from the publisher once sold</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re gonna do the primary writing of the book.</p>
<p>In fact, it will, in most circumstances, hurt you</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve already written it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re trying to sell, well, I guess the agent,</p>
<p>first you sell it to the agent</p>
<p>and then the agent sells it to the publishers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much easier to get an agent than a book deal.</p>
<p>So the thought is, if you can&rsquo;t get an agent,</p>
<p>then why would you?</p>
<p>So you start with, and also the way this works</p>
<p>with a good agent is they know all the editors</p>
<p>and they have lunch with the editors</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re always just like,</p>
<p>okay, what projects do you have coming?</p>
<p>What are you looking for?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one of my authors.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way all these deals happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, you&rsquo;re not emailing a manuscript to a slush pile.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so first of all, the agent takes a percentage</p>
<p>and then the publishers, this is where the process comes in.</p>
<p>They take also a cut that&rsquo;s probably ridiculous.</p>
<p>So if you try to reinvent the system,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll probably be frustrated by the percentage</p>
<p>that everyone takes relative to how much bureaucracy</p>
<p>and efficiency ridiculousness there is in the system.</p>
<p>Your recommendation is like, you&rsquo;re just one ant.</p>
<p>Stop trying to build your own ant colony.</p>
<p>Well, or if you create your own process</p>
<p>for how it should work,</p>
<p>the book&rsquo;s not gonna get published.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the separate question,</p>
<p>the economic question of like,</p>
<p>should I create my own, like self publish it</p>
<p>or do something like that?</p>
<p>But putting that aside,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people I encounter</p>
<p>that wanna publish a book with a main publisher,</p>
<p>but they invent their own rules for how it works, right?</p>
<p>So then the alternative though is self publishing</p>
<p>and the downside, there&rsquo;s a lot of downsides.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like publishing an opinion piece</p>
<p>in the New York Times versus writing on a blog.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason why writing a blog post on Medium</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t get way more attention and legitimacy</p>
<p>and long lasting prestige than a New York Times article.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, for most people,</p>
<p>writing in a prestigious newspaper,</p>
<p>quote unquote prestigious, is just easier.</p>
<p>And well, and depends on your goal.</p>
<p>So, you know, like I push you towards a big publisher</p>
<p>because I think your goal, it&rsquo;s huge ideas, you want impact.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have more impact.</p>
<p>Even though, like actually,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s different ways to measure impact, right?</p>
<p>In the world of ideas.</p>
<p>And also, yeah, in the world of ideas,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like the clubhouse thing now,</p>
<p>even if the audience is not large,</p>
<p>the people in the audience are very interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the conversation feels like</p>
<p>that has long lasting impact among the people</p>
<p>in different and disparate industries</p>
<p>that are also then starting their own conversations</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, because you have other,</p>
<p>so like self publishing a book,</p>
<p>the goals that would solve,</p>
<p>you have much better ways of getting to those goals,</p>
<p>might be part of it, right?</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s the financial aspect</p>
<p>of well, you get to keep more of it,</p>
<p>I mean, the podcast is probably gonna crush</p>
<p>what the book&rsquo;s gonna do anyways, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, if it&rsquo;s, I wanna get directly</p>
<p>to certain audiences or crowds,</p>
<p>it might be harder through a traditional publisher.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s better ways to talk to those crowds.</p>
<p>It could be on clubhouse with all these new technologies,</p>
<p>self published books not gonna be the most effective way</p>
<p>to find your way to a new crowd.</p>
<p>But if the idea is like, I wanna have a,</p>
<p>leave a dent in the world of ideas,</p>
<p>then to have a vulnerable old publisher,</p>
<p>put out your book in a nice hardcover</p>
<p>and do the things they do, that goes a long way.</p>
<p>And they do do a lot.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s very difficult actually.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much involved in putting together a book.</p>
<p>They get books into bookstores</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And from an efficiency standpoint,</p>
<p>I mean, just the time involved</p>
<p>in trying to do this yourself is.</p>
<p>They have a process, right?</p>
<p>Like you said, they have a process.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got a process.</p>
<p>I mean, I know like Jocko did this recently,</p>
<p>he started his own imprint and I have a couple other.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a huge overhead.</p>
<p>I mean, if you run a business and you,</p>
<p>so like Jocko is a good case study, right?</p>
<p>So he got fed up with Simon and Schuster</p>
<p>dragging their feet and said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna start my own imprint then,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not gonna publish my kid&rsquo;s book.</p>
<p>But he, what does he do, he runs businesses, right?</p>
<p>So I think in his world, like I already run,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a partner in whatever, in Origin,</p>
<p>and I have this and that.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like, yeah, we can run businesses.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we know how to do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I do.</p>
<p>I run businesses, I have people.</p>
<p>But for like you or I, we don&rsquo;t run businesses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be terrible.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, especially these kinds of businesses, right?</p>
<p>So I do wanna launch a business with very different</p>
<p>technology business.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very different.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s very, very different, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, this is like, okay, I need copy editors</p>
<p>and graphic book binders, and I need to contract</p>
<p>with the printer, but oh, the printer doesn&rsquo;t have slots.</p>
<p>And so now I have to try to, I mean, it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I get so, I need to shut this off in my room,</p>
<p>but I get so frustrated when the system</p>
<p>could clearly be improved.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the thing that you&rsquo;re mentioning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, this is so inefficient.</p>
<p>Every time I go to the DMV or something like that,</p>
<p>you think like, ah, this could be done so much better.</p>
<p>But, and the same thing as the worry with an editor,</p>
<p>which I guess would come from the publisher,</p>
<p>like who would, how much supervision on your book</p>
<p>did you receive like, hey, do you think this is too long?</p>
<p>Or do you think the title, like title,</p>
<p>how much choice do you have in the title, in the cover,</p>
<p>in the presentation and the branding</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, all of it depends, right?</p>
<p>So when it comes on the relationship with the editor</p>
<p>on the writing, it depends on the editor</p>
<p>and it depends on you.</p>
<p>So like at this point, I&rsquo;m on my seventh book</p>
<p>and I write for a lot of major publications.</p>
<p>And at this point I have what I feel like is a voice</p>
<p>and a level of craft that I&rsquo;m very comfortable with, right?</p>
<p>So my editor is not gonna be,</p>
<p>she kind of is gonna trust me</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna be more big picture.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m losing the thread here</p>
<p>or this seems like it could be longer.</p>
<p>Whereas the first book I wrote when I was 21,</p>
<p>I had notes such as you start a lot of sentences with so,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t use any contractions</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been doing scientific writing,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t use contractions.</p>
<p>Like you should probably use contractions.</p>
<p>It was way more, I had to go back</p>
<p>and rewrite the whole thing, yeah.</p>
<p>But ultimately the recommendation,</p>
<p>I mean, we talked offline and sort of,</p>
<p>I was thinking loosely, not really sure,</p>
<p>but I was thinking of writing a book</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a kind of desire to go self publishing,</p>
<p>not for financial reasons.</p>
<p>And the money can be good by the way, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s very power law type distributed, right?</p>
<p>So the money on a hardcover is somewhere</p>
<p>between one or $2 a book.</p>
<p>So the thing is, I personally don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But then you give up 15% to the agent, so.</p>
<p>I personally don&rsquo;t care about money</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;ve mentioned before,</p>
<p>but I for some reason really don&rsquo;t like spending money</p>
<p>on things that are not worth it.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t care if I get money,</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t like spending money on like feeding a system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s inefficient.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m contributing to the problem.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my biggest problem.</p>
<p>Right, so you&rsquo;re worried about the inefficiencies</p>
<p>of the opportunity.</p>
<p>Yeah, the fact that.</p>
<p>Like the overheads, the number of people involved.</p>
<p>Or the overheads.</p>
<p>The emails again.</p>
<p>The fact that they have this way of speaking,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m allergic to many people,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s very marketing speak.</p>
<p>Like you could tell they&rsquo;ve been having</p>
<p>Zoom meetings all day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like as opposed to a sort of creative collaborators</p>
<p>that are like also a little bit crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I suppose some of that is finding the right people.</p>
<p>Finding the right people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I would say.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say there&rsquo;s definitely,</p>
<p>and maybe it&rsquo;s just good fortune.</p>
<p>Good fortune in terms of like my agents and editors</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s really good people who see the vision</p>
<p>are smart or incredibly literary.</p>
<p>And they actually help you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like psychologically.</p>
<p>Yeah, I had a great editor when I was first moving</p>
<p>into hardcover books, for example.</p>
<p>It was my first big book advance</p>
<p>and my first sort of big deal</p>
<p>and he was like a senior editor</p>
<p>and it was very useful, you know?</p>
<p>He was like, we had a lot of long talks, right?</p>
<p>I was, so this was my fourth book,</p>
<p>So Good They Can&rsquo;t Ignore You was my first,</p>
<p>my big hardcover idea book.</p>
<p>And we had a lot of talks,</p>
<p>like even before I started writing it,</p>
<p>just let&rsquo;s talk about books and his philosophy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d been in the business for a long time.</p>
<p>He was the head of the imprint.</p>
<p>It was useful.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I mean, the other frustrating thing</p>
<p>is how long the whole thing takes.</p>
<p>Makes a long time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I suppose that&rsquo;s, you just have to accept that.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I handed in this manuscript</p>
<p>for the book that comes out now,</p>
<p>like when this, I handed it in,</p>
<p>I mean, over the summer, like during the pandemic.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not terrible, right?</p>
<p>And we were editing during the pandemic</p>
<p>and I finished it in the spring.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked most of the day,</p>
<p>except for a little bit computer science,</p>
<p>most of the day about a productive life.</p>
<p>How does love, friendship and family fit into that?</p>
<p>Is there, do you find that there&rsquo;s a tension?</p>
<p>Is it possible for relationships</p>
<p>to energize the whole process, to benefit?</p>
<p>Or is it ultimately a trade off?</p>
<p>But because life is short and ultimately</p>
<p>we seek happiness, not productivity,</p>
<p>that we have to accept that tension.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I think relationships is the,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the whole deal.</p>
<p>Like I thought about this the other day,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the context was.</p>
<p>I was thinking about if I was gonna give</p>
<p>like an advice speech, like a commencement address</p>
<p>or like giving advice to young people.</p>
<p>And like the big question I have for young people is</p>
<p>if they haven&rsquo;t already, bad things are gonna happen</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t control, so what&rsquo;s the plan, right?</p>
<p>Like, let&rsquo;s start figuring that out now</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not all, you know,</p>
<p>some people get off better than others,</p>
<p>but eventually stuff happens, right?</p>
<p>You get sick, something falls apart,</p>
<p>the economy craters, someone you know dies,</p>
<p>like all sorts of bad stuff is gonna happen, right?</p>
<p>So how are we gonna do this?</p>
<p>Like, how do we like live life when life is hard?</p>
<p>And in ways that is unfair and unpredictable,</p>
<p>then relationships is the,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the buffer for all of that.</p>
<p>Cause we&rsquo;re wired for it, right?</p>
<p>I went down this rabbit hole with digital minimalism.</p>
<p>I went down this huge rabbit hole</p>
<p>about the human brain and sociality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all we&rsquo;re wired to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like all of our brain is for this.</p>
<p>Like everything, all of our mechanisms,</p>
<p>everything is made to service the social connections</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s what kept you alive, you know?</p>
<p>I mean, you had the, your tribal connections</p>
<p>is how you didn&rsquo;t starve during a famine,</p>
<p>people would share food, et cetera.</p>
<p>And so you can&rsquo;t neglect that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like everything and people feel it, right?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no, our social networks</p>
<p>are hooked up to the pain center.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it feels so terrible when you miss someone</p>
<p>or like someone dies or something, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like how seriously we take it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a pretty accepted theory</p>
<p>that the default mode network,</p>
<p>like a lot of what the default mode network is doing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s sort of the default state our brain goes into</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re not doing something in particular</p>
<p>is practicing sociality, practicing interactions thing,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so crucial to what we do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like at the core of human thriving.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve more recently,</p>
<p>the way I think about it is like relationships first.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Given that foundation of putting like,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think we put nearly enough time into it.</p>
<p>I worry that social media is reducing relationships,</p>
<p>strong relationships.</p>
<p>Strong relationships where you&rsquo;re sacrificing</p>
<p>non trivial time and attention and resources,</p>
<p>whatever on behalf of other people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the net that is gonna allow you</p>
<p>to get through anything.</p>
<p>Then, all right.</p>
<p>Now what do we wanna do with the surplus that remains?</p>
<p>Maybe I wanna build some fire, build some tools.</p>
<p>So put relationships first.</p>
<p>I like the worst case analysis</p>
<p>from the computer science perspective.</p>
<p>Put relationships first.</p>
<p>Yeah, because everything else is just assuming average case,</p>
<p>assuming things kind of keep going as they were going.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re neglecting the fundamental human drive.</p>
<p>Like we have this, we talked about the boredom instinct.</p>
<p>We wanna build things, we wanna have impact,</p>
<p>we wanna do productivity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not nearly as clear cut of a drive of we need people.</p>
<p>But if we look at the real worst case analysis here</p>
<p>is one day you&rsquo;re pretty young now,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not gonna last very long.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna die one day.</p>
<p>Is that something you think about?</p>
<p>Little bit.</p>
<p>Are you afraid of death?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m of the mindset of,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s make that a productivity hack.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m of the mindset of we need to confront that soon.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s do what we can now</p>
<p>so that when we really confront and think about it,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re more likely to feel better about it.</p>
<p>So in other words, let&rsquo;s focus now on living</p>
<p>and doing things in such a way that we&rsquo;re proud of</p>
<p>so that when it really comes time to confront that,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re more likely to say,</p>
<p>like, okay, I feel kind of good about the situation.</p>
<p>So what, when you&rsquo;re laying on your deathbed,</p>
<p>would you, in looking back,</p>
<p>what would make you think like,</p>
<p>oh, I did okay, I&rsquo;m proud of that.</p>
<p>I optimized the hell out of that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good, I mean, it&rsquo;s a good question</p>
<p>to go backwards on.</p>
<p>I mean, this is like David Brooks&rsquo;s eulogy virtues</p>
<p>versus resume virtues.</p>
<p>Right, so his argument is that,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s another interesting DC area person.</p>
<p>I keep thinking of interesting DC area people.</p>
<p>All right, David Brooks is here too.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>His argument, he thinks eulogy virtues is,</p>
<p>so what we eulogize is different</p>
<p>than what we promote on the resume.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s his whole thing now, right?</p>
<p>His Suckin Mountain wrote the character.</p>
<p>Both these books are, he has this whole premise</p>
<p>of there&rsquo;s like this professional phase</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a phase of giving of yourself</p>
<p>and sacrificing on behalf of other people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, maybe it&rsquo;s all mixed together, right?</p>
<p>You wanna, I think living by a code is important, right?</p>
<p>I mean, this is something that&rsquo;s not emphasized enough.</p>
<p>I always think of advice that my undergrad</p>
<p>should be given that they&rsquo;re not given,</p>
<p>especially at a place like Georgetown</p>
<p>that has this like deep history</p>
<p>of trying to promote human flourishing</p>
<p>because of the Jesuit connection.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s such resiliency and pride</p>
<p>that comes out of living well, even when it&rsquo;s hard,</p>
<p>like living according to a code, living accord to,</p>
<p>which I think religion used to structure this for people.</p>
<p>But in its absence, you need some sort of replacement.</p>
<p>But even when things were,</p>
<p>soldiers get this a lot, right?</p>
<p>They experienced this a lot.</p>
<p>Even when things were tough,</p>
<p>I was able to persist in living this way</p>
<p>that I knew was right,</p>
<p>even though it wasn&rsquo;t the easiest thing</p>
<p>to do in the moment.</p>
<p>Fewer things give humans more resiliency.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like having done that,</p>
<p>your relationships were strong, right?</p>
<p>Many people coming to your funeral is a standard.</p>
<p>A lot of people are gonna come to your funeral.</p>
<p>I mean, you matter to a lot of people.</p>
<p>And then maybe having done,</p>
<p>to the extent of whatever capabilities</p>
<p>you happen to be granted,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re different for different people,</p>
<p>and some people can sprint real fast,</p>
<p>and some people can do math problems,</p>
<p>try to actually do something of impact.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just promise to give gift cards</p>
<p>to anybody who shows up to the funeral.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna hack it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna hack even the funeral.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gonna be a lottery wheel you spin</p>
<p>when you come in and someone goes away with $10,000.</p>
<p>See, the problem is, with all this living by principles,</p>
<p>living a principled life,</p>
<p>focusing on relationships,</p>
<p>and kind of thinking of this life as this perfect thing</p>
<p>kind of forgets the notion that none of it</p>
<p>makes any sense, right?</p>
<p>It kind of implies that this is like a video game</p>
<p>and you wanna get a high score,</p>
<p>as opposed to none of this even makes sense.</p>
<p>Like, why would he, like, what that?</p>
<p>Like, what does it even mean to die?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be over.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like everything I do, all these productivity hacks,</p>
<p>all this life, all these efforts, all this creative efforts,</p>
<p>kind of assume it&rsquo;s gonna go on forever.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of a sense of immortality,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t even know how to intellectually</p>
<p>make sense that it ends.</p>
<p>Of course, gotta ask you in that context,</p>
<p>what do you think is the meaning of it all,</p>
<p>especially for a computer scientist?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s gotta be some mathematical.</p>
<p>Yeah, 27, or what&rsquo;s the, what&rsquo;s the Douglas Adams?</p>
<p>Yeah, or 42, okay.</p>
<p>27 is a better number.</p>
<p>I should read more sci fi.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re onto something with a 27.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna give away too much, but just trust me, 27.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s visible, yeah.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know, obviously, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m a&hellip;</p>
<p>I was hoping you would.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know, but going back to what you were saying</p>
<p>about the sort of the existentialist,</p>
<p>or sort of the more nihilist style approach,</p>
<p>the one thing that there is are intimations, right?</p>
<p>So that there&rsquo;s these intimations that human halves</p>
<p>of somehow this feels right, and this feels wrong,</p>
<p>this feels good, this feels like I&rsquo;m doing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aligned with something, you know,</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m acting with courage to save, whatever, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, these intimations</p>
<p>are a grounding against arbitrariness.</p>
<p>Like, one of the ideas I&rsquo;m really interested in is that</p>
<p>when you look at religion, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m interested in world religions.</p>
<p>My grandfather was like a theologian</p>
<p>that studied and wrote all these books,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m very interested in this type of stuff.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this great book that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not specific to a particular religion,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s Karen Armstrong wrote this great book</p>
<p>called The Case for God.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>She was a Catholic nun who sort of left that religion,</p>
<p>but one of the smartest thinkers</p>
<p>in terms of like accessible theological thinking</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not tied to any particular religion.</p>
<p>Her whole argument is that the way to understand religion,</p>
<p>first of all, you have to go way back pre enlightenment</p>
<p>where all this was formed.</p>
<p>We got messed up thinking about religion</p>
<p>post enlightenment, right?</p>
<p>And these were operating systems</p>
<p>for making sense of intimations.</p>
<p>The one thing we had were these different intimations</p>
<p>of this field, like awe and mystical experience.</p>
<p>And this feels, there&rsquo;s something you feel</p>
<p>when you act in a certain way</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t act in this other way.</p>
<p>And it was like the scientists who were trying to study</p>
<p>and understand the model of the atom</p>
<p>by just looking at experiments and trying to understand</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Like the great religions of the world</p>
<p>were basically figuring out</p>
<p>how do we make sense of these intimations</p>
<p>and live in alignment with them</p>
<p>and build a life of meaning around that.</p>
<p>What were the tools they were using?</p>
<p>They were using ritual.</p>
<p>They were using belief.</p>
<p>They were using action, but all of it was like an OS.</p>
<p>It was like a liturgical model of the atom that did.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard coded in.</p>
<p>So it did through the evolutionary process.</p>
<p>I mean, they wouldn&rsquo;t have called it that back then</p>
<p>or yeah, I mean, they didn&rsquo;t have that as pre enlightenment.</p>
<p>They just said, this is here.</p>
<p>And the directive is to try to live in alignment with that.</p>
<p>Well, then I want to ask who wrote the original code.</p>
<p>Yeah, so Armstrong lays out this good argument</p>
<p>and where it gets really interesting</p>
<p>is that she emphasizes that all of this</p>
<p>was considered ineffable, right?</p>
<p>So the whole notion, and this is like rich</p>
<p>in Jewish tradition in particular</p>
<p>and also in Islamic tradition,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t comprehend and understand what&rsquo;s going on here.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And so the best we can do to approximate understanding</p>
<p>and live in alignment is we act as if this is true,</p>
<p>do these rituals, have these actions or whatever.</p>
<p>Post enlightenment, a lot of that got,</p>
<p>once we learned about enlightenment,</p>
<p>we grew these suspicions around religion</p>
<p>that are very much of the modern era, right?</p>
<p>So like the Karen Armstrong,</p>
<p>like Sam Harris&rsquo;s critique of religion makes no sense.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>The critique&rsquo;s based on, well, this is,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making the ascent to propositions</p>
<p>that you think are true for which you do not have evidence</p>
<p>that they are true.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an enlightenment thing, right?</p>
<p>This is not the context and this is not,</p>
<p>the religion is the Rutherford model of the atom.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not actually maybe what is underneath happening,</p>
<p>but this model explains why your chemical equations work.</p>
<p>And so this is like the way religion was.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a God, we&rsquo;ll call it this, this is how it works,</p>
<p>we do this ritual, we act in this way,</p>
<p>it aligns with it, just like the model of the atom</p>
<p>predicted why NA and CL is gonna become salt,</p>
<p>this predicts that you&rsquo;re gonna feel</p>
<p>and live in alignment, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this beautiful sophisticated theory,</p>
<p>which actually matches how a lot of great theologians</p>
<p>have thought about it.</p>
<p>But then when you come forward in time,</p>
<p>yeah, maybe it&rsquo;s evolution.</p>
<p>I mean, this is like what Peterson hints at, right?</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s basically, he doesn&rsquo;t like to get super pinned down</p>
<p>on this, but it kind of seems where he sees it that way.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s almost like searching for the words.</p>
<p>He focuses more on like Jung and other people,</p>
<p>but I mean, I know he&rsquo;s very Jungian,</p>
<p>but that same type of analysis, I think, roughly speaking,</p>
<p>like Armstrong is sort of a, it&rsquo;s kind of like a Peter</p>
<p>Sony analysis, but she&rsquo;s looking more at the deep history</p>
<p>of religion than, but yeah, he throws in an evolutionary.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I wonder what home it finds,</p>
<p>I wonder what the new home is if religion dissipates</p>
<p>and what the new home for these kinds of</p>
<p>natural inclinations are, whether it&rsquo;s technology,</p>
<p>whether&hellip;</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s evolution, I mean, this is Francis Collins&rsquo;s</p>
<p>book also, he&rsquo;s like, well, that&rsquo;s a religious,</p>
<p>that could be a very religious notion.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I think this stuff is interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a very religious person,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m thinking it&rsquo;s not a bad idea.</p>
<p>Maybe what replaces, honestly, like maybe what replaces</p>
<p>religion is a return to religion,</p>
<p>but in this sort of more sophisticated&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, if you went back, yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s the issue</p>
<p>with like a lot of the recent critiques,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a strong critique in a complicated way, right?</p>
<p>Because the whole way these, the way this works,</p>
<p>I mean, the theologians, if you&rsquo;re reading Paul Tillich,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re reading Heschel, if you&rsquo;re reading these people,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re thinking very sophisticatedly about religion</p>
<p>in terms of this, it&rsquo;s ineffable,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just these things, and it connects us</p>
<p>to these things in a way that puts life in alignment.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t really explain what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>because our brains can&rsquo;t handle it, right?</p>
<p>For the average person though, this notion of live as if</p>
<p>is kind of how religions work, is live as if this is true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like an OS for getting in alignment with,</p>
<p>because through cultural evolution,</p>
<p>like you behave in this way, do these words,</p>
<p>live as if this is true gives you</p>
<p>the goal you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a complicated thing, live as if this is true,</p>
<p>because if you, especially if you&rsquo;re not a theologian,</p>
<p>to say, yeah, this is not true in an enlightenment sense,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m living as if, it kind of takes the heat out of it,</p>
<p>but of course it&rsquo;s what people are doing</p>
<p>because highly religious people still do bad things,</p>
<p>where if you really were, there&rsquo;s absolutely a hell</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m definitely gonna go to it if I do this bad thing,</p>
<p>you would never have, you know,</p>
<p>no one would ever murder anyone</p>
<p>if they were an evangelical Christian, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like what, this is kind of a tangent</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m on shaky ground here,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve been interested off and on a lot.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s fascinating, I mean,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re in some sense searching for,</p>
<p>because it does make for a good operating system,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re searching for a good live as if X is true</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re searching for a new X.</p>
<p>And maybe artificial intelligence will be the very,</p>
<p>the new gods that we&rsquo;re so desperately looking for.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;ll just spit out 42.</p>
<p>I thought it was 27.</p>
<p>Cal, this is, as you know, I&rsquo;ve been a huge fan,</p>
