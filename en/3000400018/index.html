And coming soon, more inspiring guests in Time to Walk Season Two.</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>Anderson Cooper: Everybody sees things through a particular lens, and I just think there&rsquo;s such value in asking yourself every now and then, &ldquo;What if I&rsquo;m wrong? Like, what if the way I see something is actually wrong?&rdquo; And I&rsquo;m entirely open to that possibility in my life at all times. Like, maybe I need to step outside myself, walk in this person&rsquo;s shoes a little bit and see things through their eyes. And I think that&rsquo;s absolutely what helped me become or led me to become a reporter. It&rsquo;s not natural for me to ask questions. I&rsquo;m really painfully shy. But to understand somebody else, to understand how somebody else survives, to understand how somebody makes choices, I think it&rsquo;s incredibly valuable.</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>Jane Fonda: I tend to be a loner. I‚Ä¶ I have a very hard time meeting new people, but during those four months in D.C. of Fire Drill Fridays where all I was doing is meeting people that I didn&rsquo;t know, I got over that. I&rsquo;ve never hugged so many people in my life. And even though these times are so difficult and challenging and turbulent, because I know that I&rsquo;m doing my best, I&rsquo;m not depressed anymore. And I feel proud that I&rsquo;ve overcome some of my fears, and just following through with that initial inspiration. So, if you&rsquo;re feeling depressed, take action in whatever way you can. Do something that makes you feel that you&rsquo;re making a difference because, believe me, it makes a difference.</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>Jon M. Chu: I didn‚Äôt think about this at the time but, you know, I think a lot of times we, we look beyond our back yards for inspiration, when in fact, actually, the thing that made us us, the community around us, the source that gave us the need to go make things or do something, is right in front of us. So I think, when you‚Äôre looking at your own life and what you need and what‚Äôs going to give you that power, I say look at your own community because I think there‚Äôs so much that has given you already and there‚Äôs so much that that can give you right now.</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>Ibram X. Kendi: I think we have no alternative other than to believe that we can do the impossible. And to do the impossible is to overcome that adversity in front of us or in front of us as a society because the only other alternative is for us to literally die or for‚Ä¶ for us to be harmed. And, and I just want to encourage people. I want to encourage you that, once you lose hope, you&rsquo;re guaranteed to lose. But if we can believe that we can do the impossible, then we&rsquo;ll spend the rest of our lives trying to do it.</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>Draymond Green: In the process of trying to please everyone else, there&rsquo;s always going to be someone upset that don&rsquo;t like what you did, whatever that thing is. Then you&rsquo;re going to sit there and dissect everything that they think about what you&rsquo;re doing? It doesn&rsquo;t even make sense. It don&rsquo;t matter what everyone else thinks about what it is that you want to do. Do what gives you gratification. Do what makes you feel good. Do what makes you feel whole, what makes you feel accomplished because, at the end of the day, that&rsquo;s what matters.</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>Min Jin Lee: I think for those of us who haven&rsquo;t found our speaking voice, our writing voice, or even our physical voices, there is consolation because, in my experience, those who are quiet bring so much to the table and to their community. I know that the world is a hard place for introverts. But I think of talking and writing and expressing as a way that you could sort of manage the difficulty of life. Like, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re always going to conquer it, but I do think it&rsquo;s possible to manage it by expression.</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>Anthony Ramos: It&rsquo;s amazing, like, how when we just continue to say yes to things in life that we don&rsquo;t really, like, understand, like, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand why I&rsquo;m saying yes right now. I don&rsquo;t really know how I&rsquo;m going to do this.&rdquo; But we just say yes. I think it was the willingness to just say yes to things that I didn‚Äôt completely understand or things that scared me the most that then turned into some of the most beautiful blessings I‚Äôve ever received.</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>Malcolm Gladwell: I had a definition of joy that was completely confused, and that joy is not about doing something excellently. Joy is about the participation in something that brings you pleasure at whatever level you want to join it. So running has kind of returned to the‚Ä¶ near the center of my life again, but now I am at peace with the fact that I am not any good anymore, you know? I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m 57 now. I don&rsquo;t win races. You know, I&rsquo;m creaky. I can only run three days a week. But I understand now that the point is not to be great. And once you accept the fact that the point is not to be great, then a whole world of, of happiness is open to you.</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>Kesha: I realized that it does not matter whether or not you win or lose. And I can look back and just say, &ldquo;I showed up.&rdquo; And I think that&rsquo;s the hardest part sometimes in life, is showing up to the really, really scary stuff. It&rsquo;s not about being fearless. It&rsquo;s about not letting fear win and, like, weighing out the benefits and rewards and the safety of it. And if it&rsquo;s a safe thing, that you&rsquo;re going to be really proud of yourself if you do it, then, like, take a risk and be nervous. It&rsquo;s okay to be nervous. Sometimes it makes things better when you&rsquo;re nervous because you know you care.</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>Ruby Bridges: We have to be hopeful that we are going to get to a better place. If not, then what are we doing this for? We should not ever be a hopeless people. It is not going to be an easy fight. Never is. But we all really do have a responsibility to leave this place better than we found it.</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>Uzo Aduba: Isn&rsquo;t that what faith is, really? It&rsquo;s believing in something you can&rsquo;t see or touch. I can&rsquo;t see it now, but I know what I saw, how my heart and life were changed from that moment. You just always have to believe, like leave just, like, the smallest room for hope in anything, you know. Not just work, in life, with family, all of it. Things may feel trying and hard. But there is always good. Things will always work out and will always be okay.</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>Shawn Mendes: &ldquo;Wonder&rdquo; is the mama of my album, and I love this song so much because I think, as I was writing it, it was really kind of a lesson of: &ldquo;Can I say how I feel, or am I afraid of what people are going to think?&rdquo; And it&rsquo;s‚Ä¶ I think will be one of my favorite songs to date because no matter how many times I listen to it, it always reminds me of, like, &ldquo;Oh, yeah, you got to‚Ä¶ you got be you. And you got to just be free and let yourself be free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>[MUSIC FADES IN]</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve‚Ä¶ I realize that the more I talk about my truth, the more people resonate with that truth and the more people kind of really feel affected by it.</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>[MUSIC - &ldquo;WONDER&rdquo; BY SHAWN MENDES]</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>Wanda Sykes: Sade, oh, my god. I love Sade so much. I went to a Sade concert, and the next day I called in happy. I called my boss, and I said, &ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;m fine. I&rsquo;m not sick. I&rsquo;m just too happy to come to work today. Do y&rsquo;all have happy leave?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;You know what, just stay home because anyone who has the balls to call in happy and just to be so honest, I want you to enjoy your day.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;Well, okay, cool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>But &ldquo;Keep Looking&rdquo; is just such a great song, and if you&rsquo;re beating yourself up, and you need to make that shift‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>[MUSIC FADES IN]</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>‚Ä¶ put this on. Yeah. &ldquo;Keep Looking&rdquo;.</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>[MUSIC - &ldquo;KEEP LOOKING&rdquo; BY SADE]</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>Nick Jonas: When I was a kid, I was doing Broadway shows and was so into musical theater and shows like &ldquo;Les Mis&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Christmas Carol&rdquo;, &ldquo;Annie Get Your Gun.&rdquo; I just lived and breathed that music. But then my dad gave me all his music to listen to and kind of gave me an education. And the first artist I really did a deep dive on was Stevie Wonder, who I&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough now to perform with a few times, to spend some time with. And this song became incredibly important to me in my early life and discovery of music. It‚Äôs called &ldquo;Overjoyed&rdquo;.</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>[MUSIC - &ldquo;OVERJOYED&rdquo; BY STEVIE WONDER]</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>Misty Copeland: This song has such a beautiful representation of Black love. I think it&rsquo;s just a beautiful interpretation that Black people can have intimate, loving, caring relationships where the two partners are equal. And I feel like this song is a really good representation of that. And the song is &ldquo;Best Part&rdquo; by H.E.R.</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>[MUSIC - &ldquo;BEST PART&rdquo; BY H.E.R.]</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>Bubba Wallace: You know, as I get older, I, I need to go back and really listen to some of these songs to kind of understand the meaning because I&rsquo;m just kind of looking at it from a surface level, and just the vibe of it is super fun, super chill. This song is called &ldquo;Losers&rdquo; by The Weeknd featuring Labrinth. I&rsquo;ve always been a huge fan of this artist and the direction he goes with his music.</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>[MUSIC - &ldquo;LOSERS&rdquo; BY THE WEEKND (FEAT. LABRINTH)]</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>[DOLLY PARTON SINGS A LINE FROM &ldquo;9 TO 5&rdquo;]</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>Dolly Parton: Hear that little sound? Well, that&rsquo;s my acrylic fingernails. That&rsquo;s actually how I wrote the song &ldquo;9 to 5&rdquo;.</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>[DOLLY PARTON TAPS HER FINGERNAILS]</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>I thought this sounded like a typewriter. And since that movie was about women in the workplace, I&rsquo;d stand on the set, I&rsquo;d watch things happening, I&rsquo;d come up with little lines every day. I&rsquo;d go back to my hotel room at night, get my guitar, put it down on tape until, after a couple of months, I had a song. And then, of course, I had all the girls on the set, I had them all come down to the recording studio to sing the backgrounds, and I played my nails. Even on the record, it says, &ldquo;Nails by Dolly.&rdquo; But, anyhow, everybody makes me do this all the time, play this little sound. Now, of course, you have to have acrylic nails. Your own nails won&rsquo;t do that. So you got to have falses.</p>
