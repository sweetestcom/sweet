    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re discussing supplements,</p>
<p>or more specifically, a rational guide to supplementation.</p>
<p>Now, to be forthright,</p>
<p>I want to tell you that I am not a fan</p>
<p>of the word supplements,</p>
<p>because it stems from this idea</p>
<p>that all supplements are somehow food supplements</p>
<p>or designed to compensate</p>
<p>for what one could otherwise get from food,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s simply not the case.</p>
<p>Many supplements are compounds</p>
<p>that are extremely efficacious,</p>
<p>for instance, for enhancing sleep</p>
<p>or for enhancing hormone function or for enhancing focus,</p>
<p>and many of those compounds are simply not found in food</p>
<p>or are not found in enough abundance in food</p>
<p>to have the desired effect.</p>
<p>Now, that raises the issue</p>
<p>as to whether or not these compounds</p>
<p>are good to take, safe to take,</p>
<p>and whether or not they are actually beneficial for us,</p>
<p>and the short answer is that, like everything else,</p>
<p>supplements can either be good for us or dangerous for us,</p>
<p>depending on dosage, sourcing, et cetera,</p>
<p>but more importantly,</p>
<p>we need to think about supplements</p>
<p>and a rational guide to supplementation</p>
<p>as taking into account a number of different factors,</p>
<p>and we need to set aside the idea</p>
<p>that all non-prescription compounds</p>
<p>that fall under this umbrella term supplements</p>
<p>are simply things that could be extracted from food,</p>
<p>but most people don&rsquo;t either ingest enough of those foods</p>
<p>or pay enough attention to their diet</p>
<p>in order to obtain them.</p>
<p>In fact, during today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to give you a number of different,</p>
<p>very specific questions that you can answer</p>
<p>in order to decide whether or not</p>
<p>you should be taking any so-called supplements or not,</p>
<p>and whether or not you should be taking</p>
<p>one type of supplement or another type of supplement</p>
<p>more or less than the other.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also going to discuss safety, of course,</p>
<p>and I will discuss cost,</p>
<p>because obviously monetary cost is a serious consideration</p>
<p>for most, if not everybody,</p>
<p>considering the use of supplements.</p>
<p>During today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>I will also discuss which specific supplements are optimal</p>
<p>for achieving specific endpoints,</p>
<p>such as improved sleep, such as improved focus,</p>
<p>and such as improved hormone function, among other things.</p>
<p>I plan to cover the full range</p>
<p>of what are referred to as supplements,</p>
<p>including so-called foundational supplements</p>
<p>that are designed to act as a sort of insurance policy</p>
<p>against any deficiencies that might exist within your diet,</p>
<p>all the way up to very targeted outcome</p>
<p>supplements and compounds,</p>
<p>that is compounds that are non-prescription</p>
<p>that are designed to achieve very specific endpoints,</p>
<p>such as enhanced focus over the next four to six hours</p>
<p>of physical work or mental work, so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Plan to cover everything in between that as well,</p>
<p>and I promise to cover how supplements interact</p>
<p>with other things such as behavioral tools,</p>
<p>prescription drugs, when supplements</p>
<p>might be a good alternative to prescription drugs,</p>
<p>when they might not be a good alternative</p>
<p>to prescription drugs,</p>
<p>when supplements can serve as an augment</p>
<p>to already excellent nutrition and prescription protocols,</p>
<p>and every feature of supplements</p>
<p>as it relates to mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>By the end of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>you should be armed with a number of different questions,</p>
<p>as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>that will allow you to develop</p>
<p>the most biologically effective</p>
<p>and cost-effective supplement regimen for you.</p>
<p>And of course, I want to acknowledge that for some people,</p>
<p>the total amount or dosages of a given supplement</p>
<p>or supplements that you might need to take could be zero,</p>
<p>there are such individuals,</p>
<p>but that many people can in fact derive</p>
<p>tremendous benefit from supplements</p>
<p>in a way that can be more cost-effective</p>
<p>than trying to obtain</p>
<p>the same non-prescription nutrients from food.</p>
<p>As we head into today&rsquo;s conversation,</p>
<p>I want to emphasize something very important,</p>
<p>not just as it relates to supplements,</p>
<p>but as it relates to all aspects of mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance,</p>
<p>and that is I take the stance that behavioral tools,</p>
<p>that is specific actions that we take</p>
<p>and specific actions that we avoid,</p>
<p>form the foundation of mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>So things like viewing morning sunlight</p>
<p>and exercise are behavioral tools.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t require the ingestion of anything.</p>
<p>Within the realm of behavioral tools,</p>
<p>there are also some don&rsquo;ts or do nots</p>
<p>that can greatly enhance our mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance,</p>
<p>such as avoiding bright light exposure to your eyes</p>
<p>between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.,</p>
<p>or avoiding caffeine too late in the afternoon,</p>
<p>because even if you can fall asleep</p>
<p>after ingesting caffeine in the late afternoon,</p>
<p>we know it disrupts the architecture of your sleep</p>
<p>in ways that greatly diminish your mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance the following day,</p>
<p>for instance.</p>
<p>So behavioral tools form the foundational layer</p>
<p>of all tools for mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>Second to that, I would say the next layer</p>
<p>is in fact nutrition.</p>
<p>No amount of supplementation or non-prescription compounds</p>
<p>or prescription compounds, for that matter,</p>
<p>can ever compensate for poor nutrition,</p>
<p>at least not for very long, okay?</p>
<p>So this is a key point.</p>
<p>Even though many supplements are not simply food supplements</p>
<p>because they are not designed to compensate</p>
<p>for anything that you could otherwise get from food,</p>
<p>that is not to say that you can live on supplements.</p>
<p>You know, I suppose you could live on whey protein</p>
<p>and fish oil capsules and vitamin capsules</p>
<p>or tablets for a short while,</p>
<p>but before long, you&rsquo;d either suffer from boredom</p>
<p>to the extent that you&rsquo;d want to go back to food</p>
<p>or some other deficiency would show up.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the rare individual that tries to survive</p>
<p>entirely on food supplements and things of that sort.</p>
<p>Most everybody, and I would hope everybody,</p>
<p>is paying attention to their nutrition.</p>
<p>So I would place behavioral tools, do&rsquo;s and do nots,</p>
<p>as layer one, the deepest layer, the bedrock</p>
<p>of all mental health, physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>On top of that, I would place nutrition.</p>
<p>And of course, that&rsquo;s going to mean different things</p>
<p>to different people, with the understanding</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a huge array of different food choices</p>
<p>and nutritional programs.</p>
<p>Nutrition is fundamentally important for macronutrients,</p>
<p>for storage of energy in the form of glycogen fats</p>
<p>and phosphocreatine stores and so forth,</p>
<p>but also for obtaining basic nutrients,</p>
<p>vitamins, minerals, and micronutrients, okay?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got behavioral tools, nutritional tools.</p>
<p>Then on top of that, I would place</p>
<p>what is typically called supplementation,</p>
<p>although today I&rsquo;m trying to expand that word</p>
<p>to include not just things that compensate</p>
<p>for food deficiencies or that are layered on top of food</p>
<p>as a way to enhance the amount of nutrients</p>
<p>that you could get from food, but as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>compounds that are non-prescription</p>
<p>that can be for a variety of different purposes,</p>
<p>and many of which are not available in food.</p>
<p>So I would place supplementation right on top of nutrition.</p>
<p>Then past that, I would say prescription drugs,</p>
<p>obviously prescribed from a board-certified</p>
<p>MD can serve a very vital purpose in the treatment</p>
<p>or augmentation of mental health, physical health,</p>
<p>and performance goals.</p>
<p>So some people do in fact need prescription antidepressants,</p>
<p>other people do not.</p>
<p>Some people do in fact need prescription drugs</p>
<p>for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</p>
<p>or sleep-related disorders, so on and so forth.</p>
<p>The whole issue of whether or not</p>
<p>there is an over-prescription epidemic or not</p>
<p>is a separate conversation for a separate podcast.</p>
<p>I would argue that many prescription drugs</p>
<p>do in fact save lives.</p>
<p>This includes the category of prescription drugs</p>
<p>related to statins and cardiovascular health,</p>
<p>related to any number of different things,</p>
<p>even sleep disorders and insomnia, narcolepsy, and so forth.</p>
<p>That said, there are many instances</p>
<p>in which people can either reduce their dosages</p>
<p>of prescription compounds</p>
<p>or can replace those prescription compounds</p>
<p>with quality behavioral tools,</p>
<p>nutrition, and supplementation,</p>
<p>but there are many instances in which prescription drugs</p>
<p>are the only route by which people can achieve</p>
<p>the mental health, physical health, and performance goals</p>
<p>that they wish to achieve.</p>
<p>So I would place that as the fourth layer</p>
<p>in this stack of layers directed towards mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>So just to list off again,</p>
<p>I fundamentally believe that behaviors, dos, and do nots</p>
<p>form the foundation of mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, performance.</p>
<p>Next in line would be nutrition,</p>
<p>that is the specific foods we eat,</p>
<p>the amount that we eat,</p>
<p>the combinations of foods that we eat in a given sitting,</p>
<p>and the timing in which we eat our food.</p>
<p>Then on top of that, I would place supplementation,</p>
<p>the topic of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>and finally, prescription drugs.</p>
<p>And of course, all of these things interact</p>
<p>in important and interesting ways,</p>
<p>many of which interactions we will discuss</p>
<p>during today&rsquo;s podcast</p>
<p>as we drill into the topic of supplementation,</p>
<p>developing a rational supplementation protocol,</p>
<p>and one that is most biologically and cost-effective.</p>
<p>Before moving further into today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>I want to emphasize a very important point,</p>
<p>which is that I am not a physician,</p>
<p>that is, I&rsquo;m not a clinician,</p>
<p>so I do not prescribe anything,</p>
<p>nor am I going to do that today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a professor, I review the research literature,</p>
<p>I describe tools gleaned from the research literature</p>
<p>and developed from the research literature.</p>
<p>So I profess many things, but I do not prescribe anything,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s vitally important</p>
<p>that anytime you are thinking of adding or subtracting</p>
<p>any behavioral protocols, nutritional protocols,</p>
<p>supplementation-based protocols,</p>
<p>and certainly prescription drug-based protocols,</p>
<p>for whatever purpose,</p>
<p>that you consult a trusted, board-certified physician.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s absolutely essential.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say that merely to protect me,</p>
<p>I mainly say that to protect you.</p>
<p>The most important aspect of today&rsquo;s episode</p>
<p>is not going to be that you discover</p>
<p>one particular supplement or category of supplements</p>
<p>or blend of supplements</p>
<p>that is going to transform your mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>No, the purpose of today&rsquo;s episode</p>
<p>is for you to understand where you have needs</p>
<p>that can be met by supplementation</p>
<p>better than any other approach,</p>
<p>and most importantly, how to think about supplementation.</p>
<p>That is, how to think about the different categories</p>
<p>of supplements that are out there</p>
<p>and how those interact with your nutrition</p>
<p>and your behaviors so that you can maximize</p>
<p>your immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>What I mean by this is that we have this word,</p>
<p>supplements or supplementation,</p>
<p>but that means many, many different things.</p>
<p>It means vitamins, it means minerals, it means adaptogens.</p>
<p>Most people probably don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>what an adaptogen really is,</p>
<p>and in fact, many people talking about adaptogens</p>
<p>never actually define what an adaptogen is</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s designed for,</p>
<p>or the fact that many adaptogens</p>
<p>are also used for other purposes.</p>
<p>So today&rsquo;s discussion is really about</p>
<p>you learning how to think about supplementation</p>
<p>the same way you would learn to think about nutrition</p>
<p>or exercise or anything related</p>
<p>to brain and body health for that matter</p>
<p>in a way that lets you navigate this vast space</p>
<p>that we call supplementation</p>
<p>and develop protocols that are optimal for you.</p>
<p>And indeed, it may be the case that the ideal dosage</p>
<p>of a given supplement for you is zero milligrams.</p>
<p>For instance, if I ask you,</p>
<p>are you sleeping deeply and enough each night?</p>
<p>Do you feel rested throughout the day?</p>
<p>Maybe you need a short nap and that&rsquo;s it,</p>
<p>or maybe you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And you say, yes, I feel great.</p>
<p>I sleep great.</p>
<p>I wake up feeling great.</p>
<p>I only need a short nap or no nap during the day</p>
<p>to feel rested throughout the day.</p>
<p>Well, then there&rsquo;s really no discussion</p>
<p>about sleep supplementation to be had between you and me.</p>
<p>However, if you are not sleeping well,</p>
<p>then a big discussion opens up as to what the reasons are.</p>
<p>Is it related to nutrition or when you&rsquo;re exercising</p>
<p>or ingesting caffeine?</p>
<p>In other words, no discussion about supplementation</p>
<p>can be had in a vacuum.</p>
<p>Rather, discussions about supplementation</p>
<p>need to be considered in a larger context.</p>
<p>So today you&rsquo;re going to learn how to place the discussion</p>
<p>and thinking about supplementation in a larger context</p>
<p>and think about how specific supplements,</p>
<p>that is specific ingredients and combinations of ingredients</p>
<p>can indeed be used to buffer and support your overall health</p>
<p>and lead you to specific health and performance outcomes.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Momentus.</p>
<p>Momentus makes supplements of the absolute highest quality.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab Podcast has decided</p>
<p>to partner with Momentus</p>
<p>because of the extremely high quality</p>
<p>of Momentus supplements</p>
<p>and because they have single ingredient formulations.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ll discuss more on today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>single ingredient formulations are essential</p>
<p>for most all aspects of developing a rational,</p>
<p>highly efficacious supplement regimen.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because the ideal supplement regimen</p>
<p>allows you to adjust the dosages of individual ingredients</p>
<p>as well as alternate days</p>
<p>in which specific ingredients are consumed.</p>
<p>It also allows you, for instance,</p>
<p>to assess whether or not one given ingredient works for you</p>
<p>and another ingredient does not.</p>
<p>And it also allows you to assess</p>
<p>whether or not any side effects originate</p>
<p>from a specific component of your supplement protocol.</p>
<p>Another advantage of Momentus supplements</p>
<p>is that they ship anywhere in the world</p>
<p>because we realize that many of you reside</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try any of the supplements</p>
<p>mentioned in today&rsquo;s or other episodes</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>so for instance, things related to sleep augmentation,</p>
<p>hormone augmentation, enhancing focus,</p>
<p>metabolic health, or otherwise,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus, spelled O-U-S,</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means plenty of sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar.</p>
<p>Getting sufficient hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>is key to brain health and body health.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because every cell in your brain and body</p>
<p>relies on having enough electrolytes available</p>
<p>in order to function.</p>
<p>This is especially true of the so-called neurons</p>
<p>or nerve cells in your brain.</p>
<p>They actually require sufficient amounts</p>
<p>of sodium and potassium and magnesium,</p>
<p>but especially sodium and potassium available to them</p>
<p>in order to fire what are called action potentials</p>
<p>or electrical signals.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what allows you to think, to feel, to move,</p>
<p>what gives you energy, so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So when you are dehydrated,</p>
<p>oftentimes you will need to get electrolytes,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s true if you&rsquo;re exercising a lot</p>
<p>or if you sweat a lot, but for many people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just true because they&rsquo;re not consuming enough water</p>
<p>and electrolytes in the form of liquids</p>
<p>and foods throughout the day.</p>
<p>Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio</p>
<p>of 1,000 milligrams of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium,</p>
<p>and 60 milligrams of magnesium.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is brought to us by Helix Sleep.</p>
<p>Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows</p>
<p>that are absolutely phenomenal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been sleeping on a Helix mattress</p>
<p>for close to two years now,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the best sleep that I&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
<p>One of the reasons is the mattress is customized to you.</p>
<p>So you simply go to the Helix site,</p>
<p>you take a brief two-minute quiz,</p>
<p>it asks you questions like do you tend to sleep</p>
<p>on your back, your side, or your stomach,</p>
<p>or maybe all of those across the night,</p>
<p>or maybe you don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>do you tend to run hot during the night</p>
<p>or cold during the night, or maybe you don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>and they match you to the ideal mattress for you.</p>
<p>For me, it was the Dusk D-U-S-K mattress</p>
<p>that allowed me to achieve the best sleep of my life.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in upgrading your mattress,</p>
<p>you can go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take their brief two-minute sleep quiz,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll match you to a customized mattress</p>
<p>for your sleep needs,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get up to $200 off all mattress orders</p>
<p>and two free pillows.</p>
<p>They have a 10-year warranty on their mattresses,</p>
<p>and you get to try it out for 100 nights risk-free.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll even pick it up for you</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t love the mattress,</p>
<p>although I think you absolutely will.</p>
<p>Again, if you&rsquo;re interested,</p>
<p>you can go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get up to $200 off and two free pillows.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about supplements and supplementation</p>
<p>and how to develop a rational supplementation regimen.</p>
<p>One of the things that&rsquo;s really emerged</p>
<p>over the last 20 years is that supplements,</p>
<p>and there I&rsquo;m referring to non-prescription compounds</p>
<p>designed to augment nutrition,</p>
<p>prescription drugs, and behavioral protocols,</p>
<p>have emerged as a mainstay within the health and wellness,</p>
<p>but also the medical communities</p>
<p>that are focused on developing mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance for their patients</p>
<p>and their athletes and for the everyday person.</p>
<p>Essentially what I&rsquo;m saying is that 20 years ago,</p>
<p>a discussion about supplements would mainly take place</p>
<p>within the niche communities of health food stores</p>
<p>or of particular athletes.</p>
<p>But nowadays, I think almost everyone is familiar</p>
<p>with the fact that yes, indeed,</p>
<p>there are standard vitamin supplements,</p>
<p>but that there are also supplements such as vitamin D3,</p>
<p>which are designed to make sure</p>
<p>that people have certain amounts of hormones</p>
<p>in their bloodstream</p>
<p>because they might not be getting enough sunshine.</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;ll be very clear over and over</p>
<p>throughout this episode</p>
<p>that there is no pill replacement for sunshine,</p>
<p>nor is there a pill replacement</p>
<p>or food replacement for that matter</p>
<p>for exercise or for social connection or for sleep</p>
<p>or for simply getting smarter.</p>
<p>Again, there is no pill that&rsquo;s going to replace</p>
<p>excellent behavioral protocols.</p>
<p>In fact, a physician friend of mine has a great saying</p>
<p>that I think everybody should keep in mind</p>
<p>as we wade into this conversation,</p>
<p>which is that better living through chemistry</p>
<p>still requires better living.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a very important phrase to keep in mind</p>
<p>when thinking about the optimal supplementation</p>
<p>or prescription drug protocol for you.</p>
<p>So what is an ideal supplementation protocol?</p>
<p>Well, I think what we need to do</p>
<p>is to take a step back and ask</p>
<p>what are different supplements designed to do?</p>
<p>For instance, there are foundational supplements.</p>
<p>These are supplements</p>
<p>that are designed to establish a foundation</p>
<p>or provide insurance along with your nutritional intake</p>
<p>to ensure that you&rsquo;re getting all the things that you need</p>
<p>in order to have a basic level of mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and opportunity for optimal performance.</p>
<p>Now, this is the one category of supplements</p>
<p>for which I think it&rsquo;s appropriate,</p>
<p>and in fact, advantageous</p>
<p>to have multiple ingredients in a given supplement.</p>
<p>Throughout the rest of today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to talk about the advantage of mainly focusing</p>
<p>on taking single ingredient formulations</p>
<p>for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>But when it comes to foundational supplements,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re mainly talking about</p>
<p>are supplements that contain vitamins and minerals</p>
<p>that are designed to compensate</p>
<p>for any deficiencies you might have from diet</p>
<p>or from lack of adequate diet.</p>
<p>How would such a lack of vitamin and mineral intake arise?</p>
<p>Well, for instance,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re somebody that practices intermittent fasting</p>
<p>or other components of fasting,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re somebody who does not get enough vitamins</p>
<p>and minerals from vegetables and fruits and grains and meats,</p>
<p>well, then taking a supplement</p>
<p>that can act as an insurance policy</p>
<p>against any vitamin and mineral deficiencies</p>
<p>in many ways can be advantageous,</p>
<p>although I will talk about some of the safety concerns</p>
<p>in just a few minutes.</p>
<p>Now, I want to acknowledge that as soon as we talk</p>
<p>about vitamin and mineral supplements,</p>
<p>the skeptics immediately raise their hands and say,</p>
<p>well, all that vitamin and mineral supplements do</p>
<p>is give you very expensive urine.</p>
<p>And there, the skeptics are referring to the fact,</p>
<p>the reality, that when you ingest high levels</p>
<p>of water-soluble vitamins,</p>
<p>so think vitamin C and some of the other vitamins,</p>
<p>that indeed you will excrete them in your urine.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s also the case that many people</p>
<p>are not getting enough of the water-soluble vitamins</p>
<p>from their foods,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s also the case that many people are.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also the case that ingesting higher</p>
<p>than needed amounts of most water-soluble vitamins,</p>
<p>provided those levels aren&rsquo;t exceedingly high,</p>
<p>is, or at least we should say, can be safe.</p>
<p>And again, this is provided that the levels</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re ingesting are not exceedingly high.</p>
<p>So the typical vitamin mineral supplement</p>
<p>is indeed going to cover any gaps or deficiencies</p>
<p>that might arise in the water-soluble vitamins</p>
<p>from your food intake.</p>
<p>But the reality is that most people are getting enough</p>
<p>of the water-soluble vitamins from their food</p>
<p>if they are paying attention to a couple of things.</p>
<p>And those things are very simple to lay out,</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not you&rsquo;re a vegan, a vegetarian,</p>
<p>a more traditional omnivore eating from both animal-based</p>
<p>and plant-based sources, grains, et cetera,</p>
<p>or even if you&rsquo;re in the pure carnivore or strict,</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s called the lion diet</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s just meat and salt.</p>
<p>Regardless of what type of nutrition you follow,</p>
<p>you will get vitamins and minerals,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ll get more or fewer of them</p>
<p>depending on the nutritional program you follow.</p>
<p>And of course, depending on how often and how much you eat.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just sort of obvious.</p>
<p>Most people who take a vitamin mineral supplement</p>
<p>will indeed excrete a lot of the water-soluble vitamins.</p>
<p>They will retain the fat-soluble vitamins.</p>
<p>And there again, the skeptics will raise their hands</p>
<p>and say, you do not want to take high levels</p>
<p>of fat-soluble vitamins</p>
<p>because they will be stored in your system</p>
<p>potentially to levels that are dangerous.</p>
<p>Again, provided that vitamin mineral supplements</p>
<p>are not taken in excess,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unlikely that you&rsquo;re going to have such a buildup</p>
<p>of the fat-soluble vitamins in your system</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re going to be a problem.</p>
<p>So that raises a very specific question</p>
<p>that you need to ask.</p>
<p>Do you want to take a vitamin mineral supplement?</p>
<p>Well, the answer to that will be highly individual,</p>
<p>but you really just need to address two things.</p>
<p>First of all, is the cost within the range</p>
<p>that you can afford and want to pay, right?</p>
<p>Oftentimes these vitamin mineral supplements</p>
<p>can be quite inexpensive,</p>
<p>but some of them can be quite expensive.</p>
<p>And you can see the full range of ones</p>
<p>that are pennies per day,</p>
<p>all the way up to many dollars or tens of dollars per day</p>
<p>because of what are reported to be variations</p>
<p>in quality and sourcing and so forth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not aware of any real differences</p>
<p>between the quality of the water-soluble</p>
<p>and fat-soluble vitamins found in the less expensive</p>
<p>versus the more expensive vitamin mineral supplements.</p>
<p>More typically, the cost scales with the dosages</p>
<p>of these different vitamins and minerals.</p>
<p>And as could probably be expected,</p>
<p>the more expensive to obtain and source vitamins</p>
<p>and minerals tend to be in lower quantities</p>
<p>in the less expensive versions</p>
<p>of vitamin mineral supplements.</p>
<p>This is kind of obvious.</p>
<p>So you need to ask yourself,</p>
<p>can you afford it financially?</p>
<p>And then you need to ask yourself,</p>
<p>are you able to regularly ingest enough foods</p>
<p>with enough variety to cover your vitamin mineral needs</p>
<p>just from food?</p>
<p>And for some people,</p>
<p>the answer is going to be an immediate yes.</p>
<p>They are careful to get enough of the foods</p>
<p>that allow them to obtain their vitamin and mineral quota.</p>
<p>And for other individuals, the answer will be no.</p>
<p>I would say for people that are extremely physically</p>
<p>and or mentally active,</p>
<p>and for people that perhaps are following</p>
<p>a intermittent fasting schedule,</p>
<p>so they are not ingesting a lot of food in general</p>
<p>or restricting their food intake to specific times of day,</p>
<p>well, then a vitamin mineral supplement</p>
<p>likely makes sense for them.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s going to be very important</p>
<p>to ingest that vitamin mineral supplement</p>
<p>with food and ideally early in the day.</p>
<p>So that can set up a little bit of a challenge</p>
<p>for the intermittent fasters</p>
<p>who are restricting their feeding window</p>
<p>to late in the day.</p>
<p>Why do I say this?</p>
<p>Well, many of the water-soluble vitamins,</p>
<p>in particular the B vitamins,</p>
<p>need to be ingested with food</p>
<p>because otherwise they can cause some stomach upset.</p>
<p>And again, there&rsquo;s a range there.</p>
<p>Some people like myself can take B vitamins</p>
<p>on an empty stomach and feel fine.</p>
<p>Other people feel really lousy when they take B vitamins.</p>
<p>There are a few other things that we&rsquo;ll talk about later,</p>
<p>namely zinc and coenzyme Q10</p>
<p>that really should also be taken with food.</p>
<p>But the best time to take a vitamin mineral supplement</p>
<p>is with food.</p>
<p>And I believe that if you&rsquo;re going to take</p>
<p>a vitamin mineral supplement,</p>
<p>that you want to take it with food</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t want to take dosages of vitamins and minerals</p>
<p>from supplements that are exceedingly high</p>
<p>for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>One is the buildup of fat-soluble vitamins</p>
<p>that we talked about before.</p>
<p>The other reason is that when people tend to take</p>
<p>very high levels of vitamins and minerals from supplements,</p>
<p>they tend to spend less time and focus on making sure</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re optimizing their nutrition</p>
<p>or at least trying to get their nutrition right.</p>
<p>What do I mean by getting their nutrition right?</p>
<p>Well, I think regardless of whether or not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re keto, omnivore, carnivore, vegan,</p>
<p>or any other nutritional plan,</p>
<p>the key thing is to get most,</p>
<p>that is about 75 to 80% of your foods or more</p>
<p>from non-processed or minimally processed sources.</p>
<p>I think there is agreement across the board</p>
<p>that most people should avoid highly processed foods.</p>
<p>Highly processed foods are going to be foods</p>
<p>with very long ingredient lists</p>
<p>that have very long shelf lives.</p>
<p>So this often includes snack foods.</p>
<p>It does include snack foods like chips, et cetera,</p>
<p>pastries that could sit on the shelf a long time,</p>
<p>but it also includes things like canned soups</p>
<p>and number of different other foods</p>
<p>that have many, many ingredients, preservatives.</p>
<p>Most people would do well to avoid those kinds of foods</p>
<p>and focus most of their intake</p>
<p>on things that are non-processed.</p>
<p>So these would be things like fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that the non-processed foods</p>
<p>will tend to have very short shelf life</p>
<p>or require refrigeration in some cases,</p>
<p>such as meat, eggs, et cetera,</p>
<p>or minimally processed foods,</p>
<p>such as rice and oatmeal and pastas,</p>
<p>beans and things of that sort.</p>
<p>Beans oftentimes can be completely unprocessed as well.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s two general categories,</p>
<p>unprocessed and minimally processed</p>
<p>that should make up about 80% or more of your food intake</p>
<p>if your goal is health and obtaining adequate amounts</p>
<p>of vitamins and minerals.</p>
<p>The so-called foundational supplements include, of course,</p>
<p>vitamin and mineral supplements,</p>
<p>but has expanded over the last decade or more</p>
<p>to also include supplements that have vitamins and minerals,</p>
<p>but also things like digestive enzymes.</p>
<p>And again, here we have an example</p>
<p>where indeed you can get digestive enzymes from foods.</p>
<p>For instance, eating a bit of papaya</p>
<p>or even a little bit of pineapple</p>
<p>can assist in the digestion</p>
<p>of certain aspects of macronutrients</p>
<p>because these are naturally occurring enzymes</p>
<p>that help digest things like carbohydrates,</p>
<p>fats, and proteins.</p>
<p>And there are other food-based sources of enzymes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome to look those up online.</p>
<p>If you just put food-based sources of enzymes</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll find those.</p>
<p>But nowadays, a lot of the foundational supplements</p>
<p>will include papain,</p>
<p>or they will include different lipases,</p>
<p>or anytime you hear the word ACE, by the way,</p>
<p>it means an enzyme.</p>
<p>An enzyme is designed to break down</p>
<p>or to catalyze some sort of reaction</p>
<p>in biology and in nutrition in particular.</p>
<p>So you can find foundational supplements</p>
<p>that include vitamins and minerals and digestive enzymes.</p>
<p>And nowadays, more and more,</p>
<p>the quality foundational supplements</p>
<p>are also including things like adaptogens.</p>
<p>And here, the name adaptogens is sort of vague,</p>
<p>and it indeed has no specific operational definition.</p>
<p>This is something really important to understand</p>
<p>about supplementation is that companies</p>
<p>and indeed podcasts can talk about adaptogens</p>
<p>without actually defining what an adaptogen is</p>
<p>in an operational way.</p>
<p>When we say operational,</p>
<p>what we mean is a definition that everyone</p>
<p>in a given arena or space, research for instance,</p>
<p>can agree on so that when we talk about</p>
<p>the adaptogenic effects of a given compound,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all talking about the same things.</p>
<p>Well, foundational supplements nowadays include</p>
<p>vitamins, minerals, digestive enzymes,</p>
<p>and the so-called adaptogens.</p>
<p>And the adaptogens, broadly speaking,</p>
<p>are thought to improve the body and brain&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to buffer against various stressors.</p>
<p>So these could be things like herbs, like ashwagandha,</p>
<p>that are designed to reduce cortisol levels.</p>
<p>In that sense, ashwagandha is an adaptogen,</p>
<p>but ashwagandha has other effects related</p>
<p>to hormone augmentation in both the testosterone</p>
<p>and estrogen, and maybe even the thyroid pathways.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about this a little bit later</p>
<p>when we talk about supplements for hormone augmentation.</p>
<p>So foundational supplements has really expanded</p>
<p>to include a lot of different categories</p>
<p>of nutrients and micronutrients,</p>
<p>vitamins and minerals, digestive enzymes,</p>
<p>designed to achieve a broad spectrum of effects.</p>
<p>Again, this is the one category of supplementation</p>
<p>where I think it makes sense</p>
<p>to explore multi-ingredient formulations.</p>
<p>And the other thing that&rsquo;s often included</p>
<p>in these so-called foundational supplements</p>
<p>are probiotics or prebiotics,</p>
<p>which are designed to augment and support</p>
<p>the so-called gut microbiome.</p>
<p>The gut microbiome is the collection</p>
<p>of trillions of little micro bacteria</p>
<p>that exist in all of us.</p>
<p>They mainly exist in the mucous membrane lined tissues</p>
<p>of the body.</p>
<p>So that would be your nasal passages, your mouth,</p>
<p>the vagina, the urethra, and the gut,</p>
<p>the whole way from your mouth all the way out the other end.</p>
<p>So not just your stomach.</p>
<p>Trillions of bacteria live there.</p>
<p>Trillions of micro bacteria also live on your skin.</p>
<p>In fact, every time you shake someone&rsquo;s hand,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re exchanging micro bacteria.</p>
<p>These micro bacteria often are healthy for us, good for us.</p>
<p>They support a huge number of positive biological functions,</p>
<p>but there are other micro bacteria that live in our gut</p>
<p>and elsewhere on those mucous line tissues</p>
<p>that can be disadvantageous for us,</p>
<p>that can harm our health.</p>
<p>A growing idea these days,</p>
<p>based on a number of different laboratories work,</p>
<p>including the laboratory of my upstairs neighbor</p>
<p>at Stanford, Dr. Justin Sonnenberg,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been a guest on this podcast,</p>
<p>is that having a great diversity, a range of microbiota,</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;re called microbiome, microbiota,</p>
<p>and these micro bacteria are all essentially referring</p>
<p>to the same thing.</p>
<p>The microbiome is the whole collection</p>
<p>of these micro bacteria,</p>
<p>but having a lot of different so-called species</p>
<p>of these micro bacteria is known to be advantageous</p>
<p>for immune system function, hormone function.</p>
<p>It supports the so-called gut brain axis</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s important for a number of things,</p>
<p>including mood and motivation.</p>
<p>It actually supports the production of neurotransmitters</p>
<p>in the brain and body that can help keep you motivated,</p>
<p>elevated mood, support the general function of neurons.</p>
<p>Well, not surprisingly,</p>
<p>there are ways to support the gut microbiome</p>
<p>and there are ways to harm the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll refer to the podcast episode we did</p>
<p>with Justin Sonnenberg.</p>
<p>You can find that at hubermanlab.com</p>
<p>if you want to learn all the different ways</p>
<p>that you can support your gut microbiome.</p>
<p>But for sake of today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that some of those methods</p>
<p>of supporting the gut microbiome</p>
<p>are through the direct consumption of particular foods.</p>
<p>And there are two categories of foods</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;re getting enough of them,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s likely that your gut microbiome is diverse</p>
<p>and is going to support all those important functions</p>
<p>I just listed off and other functions as well.</p>
<p>The two sources of gut microbiota supporting foods</p>
<p>are low sugar fermented foods.</p>
<p>So these would be things like sauerkraut, kimchi,</p>
<p>Greek yogurt, again, low sugar Greek yogurt,</p>
<p>kombucha in particular as a drink, things like kefir.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of other varieties of fermented foods,</p>
<p>different cultures at different fermented foods.</p>
<p>So the Japanese natto is another source of ferment</p>
<p>that is very good for the gut microbiome</p>
<p>and work from Justin Sonnenberg&rsquo;s lab</p>
<p>and close by labs at Stanford School of Medicine</p>
<p>have shown that if people ingest four servings a day</p>
<p>of these low sugar fermented foods,</p>
<p>it greatly improves the function of the gut microbiome</p>
<p>and in particular enhances the function</p>
<p>of the immune system</p>
<p>and it reduces the so-called inflammatome.</p>
<p>It reduces inflammation in the brain and body</p>
<p>in the ways that are helpful and effective</p>
<p>for brain and body, that is mental health,</p>
<p>physical health and performance.</p>
<p>So there are ways to support your gut microbiome</p>
<p>strictly from food, but it should come as no surprise</p>
<p>that most people are not ingesting four servings a day</p>
<p>of fermented foods.</p>
<p>Hopefully they&rsquo;re getting enough fiber,</p>
<p>especially prebiotic fiber,</p>
<p>which is one other way to support the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>Although the studies from Justin Sonnenberg&rsquo;s lab</p>
<p>point to the fact that fiber intake itself</p>
<p>was not directly supportive of the gut microbiome</p>
<p>in everybody, it was in some individuals,</p>
<p>but not in others and some had no effect</p>
<p>and in other individuals, it actually made the category</p>
<p>or I should say the array of inflammatome markers worse.</p>
<p>It actually led to more inflammation.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not to say that fiber is bad.</p>
<p>In fact, in the episode that we did with Dr. Lane Norton,</p>
<p>he discussed the many benefits of getting enough fiber.</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons why people should get enough fiber</p>
<p>in their diet, but at least for supporting</p>
<p>the gut microbiome, four servings a day</p>
<p>of low sugar fermented foods seems to be the best way</p>
<p>to support the gut microbiome</p>
<p>through the intake of nutrition.</p>
<p>Again, most people are not achieving that</p>
<p>and therefore these foundational supplements</p>
<p>that can be just vitamin and mineral supplements</p>
<p>or it could be vitamin and mineral supplements</p>
<p>plus digestive enzymes or both of those things</p>
<p>plus adaptogens now also tend to include prebiotics</p>
<p>and probiotics that are designed to support</p>
<p>the proliferation and maintenance of enough gut microbiota</p>
<p>in order to support the gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the gut brain axis.</p>
<p>Now, because of the importance of the gut microbiome</p>
<p>and because most people are not getting enough support</p>
<p>for the gut microbiome in the form</p>
<p>of low sugar fermented foods and prebiotic fiber</p>
<p>from their diet, I think perhaps one of the most essential</p>
<p>foundational supplements, irrespective of whether or not</p>
<p>it includes vitamins and minerals, adaptogens</p>
<p>and digestive enzymes is some way to support</p>
<p>the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>Now, this gets into a whole dimension of categories</p>
<p>of prebiotic and probiotic capsules</p>
<p>and one needs to be very careful there.</p>
<p>I do want to say that most of the prebiotic</p>
<p>and probiotic capsules that you can buy,</p>
<p>first of all, are very expensive.</p>
<p>The best ones are going to be refrigerated</p>
<p>or require refrigeration just as do any good</p>
<p>low sugar fermented foods, by the way.</p>
<p>So for instance, pickles are a low sugar fermented food</p>
<p>that can support the gut microbiome</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re buying pickles from the section</p>
<p>of the grocery store where the pickles</p>
<p>are not refrigerated, well then you&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to get the gut microbiome supporting effects</p>
<p>from those pickles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of funny we&rsquo;re even having this conversation</p>
<p>talking about pickles but the reality is</p>
<p>they can greatly enhance the microbiota</p>
<p>if you are getting the pickles that are</p>
<p>and require refrigeration and include the brine</p>
<p>which is the liquid around them.</p>
<p>The same is true for sauerkraut.</p>
<p>Non-refrigerated sauerkraut is not going to support</p>
<p>your gut microbiome.</p>
<p>It will supply some other things perhaps</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not going to support your gut microbiome.</p>
<p>It has to be the refrigerated versions.</p>
<p>For the reason that most people are not getting enough</p>
<p>food-based support for the gut microbiome</p>
<p>and because of the importance of the gut microbiome,</p>
<p>one of the key categories of foundational supplements</p>
<p>are supplements that create support for the microbiome</p>
<p>through prebiotics or probiotics.</p>
<p>Again, they tend to be the refrigerated varieties</p>
<p>are the ones that are actually going to work.</p>
<p>Those also tend to be very expensive.</p>
<p>And there are some evidence that taking excessive amounts</p>
<p>of prebiotics and probiotics that is typical</p>
<p>of these capsule forms of prebiotics and probiotics,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re taken ongoing, not for short periods of time</p>
<p>but if they&rsquo;re taken ongoing can lead to some issues</p>
<p>like brain fog.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a nice literature on this</p>
<p>and a growing one at that.</p>
<p>So my suggestion is that if people are going to take</p>
<p>supplements to support the microbiome</p>
<p>that those supplements include low enough levels.</p>
<p>That is small enough amounts of prebiotics and probiotics</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t start to venture into the realm</p>
<p>of brain fog and some of the other issues</p>
<p>that could be associated with taking too much prebiotic</p>
<p>and probiotic in the form of supplements.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a brief break</p>
<p>and thank our sponsor InsideTracker.</p>
<p>InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform</p>
<p>that analyzes data from your blood and DNA</p>
<p>to help you better understand your body</p>
<p>and help you reach your health goals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been a believer in getting regular blood work done</p>
<p>for the simple reason that many of the factors</p>
<p>that impact your immediate and long-term health</p>
<p>can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.</p>
<p>The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there</p>
<p>however, is that you get data back about metabolic factors,</p>
<p>lipids and hormones and so forth</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t know what to do with those data.</p>
<p>InsideTracker solves that problem</p>
<p>and makes it very easy for you to understand</p>
<p>what sorts of nutritional, behavioral,</p>
<p>maybe even supplementation based interventions</p>
<p>you might want to take on in order to adjust the numbers</p>
<p>of those metabolic factors, hormones, lipids</p>
<p>and other things that impact your immediate</p>
<p>and long-term health to bring those numbers</p>
<p>into the ranges that are appropriate</p>
<p>and indeed optimal for you.</p>

<p>The other category of foundational supplements</p>
<p>are those adaptogens that we mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Adaptogens again, being a very poorly defined category</p>
<p>but these are typically micronutrients, herbs,</p>
<p>sometimes they go into the mushroom category</p>
<p>and these are non-psychedelic mushrooms</p>
<p>that provide either some buffering to the stress system</p>
<p>by reducing cortisol typically,</p>
<p>or that are thought to or known to based on research studies</p>
<p>to enhance things like blood flow to the brain</p>
<p>or to enhance some aspect of cognitive function</p>
<p>by way of enhancing neurotransmitter function.</p>
<p>This category of so-called adaptogens</p>
<p>is an important one.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get back to this a little bit later.</p>
<p>The reason I mention it now is that it is indeed hard</p>
<p>to get the so-called adaptogens in sufficient concentrations</p>
<p>from food-based sources.</p>
<p>I have to assume that most people aren&rsquo;t out there</p>
<p>collecting chaga mushroom or the ashwagandha herbs</p>
<p>and then combining them with their salads or their foods.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why this adaptogen category</p>
<p>fits into foundational.</p>
<p>Now, this opens up the category of foundational supplements</p>
<p>that are broad spectrum.</p>
<p>That is that include vitamins and minerals</p>
<p>that have digestive enzymes, that have adaptogens,</p>
<p>and that also have prebiotics and probiotics</p>
<p>at the appropriate dosages.</p>
<p>This is one reason why I&rsquo;m a big fan of supplements</p>
<p>like Athletic Greens, which is, as many of you know,</p>
<p>a sponsor of this podcast and does really nicely cover</p>
<p>all of these categories of foundational nutrition.</p>
<p>But I do want to emphasize that this is not a way</p>
<p>to focus on Athletic Greens specifically.</p>
<p>There are other categories and brands</p>
<p>of excellent foundational nutritional supplements</p>
<p>that cover these categories of vitamins and minerals,</p>
<p>probiotics, prebiotics, digestive enzymes, and adaptogens.</p>
<p>It just so happens that Athletic Greens is the one</p>
<p>that I discovered and that works best for me</p>
<p>and that many people find works really well for them.</p>
<p>So this is why when people approach me and they ask me,</p>
<p>as they often do, very, very often do, I should say,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m only going to take one supplement,</p>
<p>what supplement should I take?</p>
<p>Rather than just give them one specific answer,</p>
<p>I actually ask them three questions.</p>
<p>First question I ask them is,</p>
<p>how well are you sleeping at night?</p>
<p>Are you getting enough sleep?</p>
<p>Are you waking up feeling rested?</p>
<p>Because if they&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>that opens up a whole different set of interactions</p>
<p>that we need to have and discussions around</p>
<p>what sorts of things they need to do and possibly take</p>
<p>in order to get their sleep right,</p>
<p>because sleep is the foundation of mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>We will have that discussion a little bit later</p>
<p>in this episode.</p>
<p>The second question I ask them is, how&rsquo;s your nutrition?</p>
<p>That is, are you eating regularly?</p>
<p>Have you found the combination of macronutrients</p>
<p>or which diet is right for you?</p>
<p>Do you think you&rsquo;re getting enough vitamins and minerals?</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s your digestion?</p>
<p>We have that conversation.</p>
<p>And then the third thing that I ask,</p>
<p>which is extremely important, is what&rsquo;s your budget?</p>
<p>Because if somebody has $10 a month total</p>
<p>to spend on supplements versus $1,000 a month</p>
<p>to spend on supplements total,</p>
<p>well, then there&rsquo;s a different set of conversations</p>
<p>to be had as to which supplements they should take.</p>
<p>Now, once those three questions have been answered,</p>
<p>assuming that somebody is able to spend about $100</p>
<p>or more on supplements per month,</p>
<p>then my recommendation is that they not focus</p>
<p>on any specific supplements directed towards sleep</p>
<p>or toward focus or hormone augmentation,</p>
<p>but rather that they focus on buffering</p>
<p>and enhancing their foundational nutrition,</p>
<p>adaptogens, probiotics, prebiotics, and digestive enzymes,</p>
<p>because of the simple fact that if they do that,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to raise the tide</p>
<p>on all the biological and organ systems</p>
<p>that are going to lead to enhanced mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance, including sleep.</p>
<p>So this is one reason why if people say,</p>
<p>well, if I can only take one supplement, what should I take?</p>
<p>I say, well, what&rsquo;s your budget?</p>
<p>If they say they can meet that $100 threshold per month,</p>
<p>then my recommendation would be athletic greens</p>
<p>or something like it,</p>
<p>or that they invest the time and energy</p>
<p>to go find the various combinations of vitamins and minerals</p>
<p>and probiotics and prebiotics and adaptogens and so forth</p>
<p>in individual components that they can then take</p>
<p>in combination in order to meet their foundational needs.</p>
<p>But most people are not interested</p>
<p>in doing all that homework and legwork</p>
<p>to figure out exactly what the dosages are.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one reason why, indeed,</p>
<p>I have taken athletic greens since 2012.</p>
<p>I like it, it makes me feel better.</p>
<p>I have more energy, I sleep better.</p>
<p>My digestion is certainly better</p>
<p>and it supports the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>I do that for that reason.</p>
<p>But again, I want to emphasize</p>
<p>that there are other great sources</p>
<p>of all the relevant things within those foundational formulas</p>
<p>that athletic greens contains.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s certainly not the only route</p>
<p>to covering your foundational health needs.</p>
<p>There are other ways to do that.</p>
<p>Now, if somebody has a budget lower than $100 per month</p>
<p>to spend on foundational supplementation,</p>
<p>well, then there are a couple of discussions to be had.</p>
<p>Now, if the amount of money that they have to devote</p>
<p>to foundational supplementation is zero,</p>
<p>of course, respect that.</p>
<p>And then it becomes a discussion about what sorts of foods</p>
<p>and patterns of food intake are going to best support</p>
<p>their mental health, physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>Now, if somebody has somewhere between $0 and $50</p>
<p>to spend on supplementation for sake of this thing</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re calling foundational health per month,</p>
<p>well, then a different category</p>
<p>of supplement discussion arises.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll have that in a moment.</p>
<p>But to sort of close the conversation</p>
<p>on foundational supplementation,</p>
<p>again, that means many different things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s vitamins and minerals.</p>
<p>Sometimes that&rsquo;s one vitamin and mineral supplement.</p>
<p>It means digestive enzymes.</p>
<p>That could be its own supplement</p>
<p>or in combination with vitamins and minerals.</p>
<p>It means often not always adaptogens,</p>
<p>things like ashwagandha,</p>
<p>different plant-based and mushroom-based formulations</p>
<p>that can buffer stress</p>
<p>and provide other brain and body support.</p>
<p>And it often, although not always,</p>
<p>but should I believe include the probiotics and prebiotics</p>
<p>or anything that supports healthy gut microbiome.</p>
<p>Once again, I think a broad spectrum supplement</p>
<p>that has many, many ingredients of high quality</p>
<p>that covers all these bases</p>
<p>is going to be the best route</p>
<p>to ensuring foundational supplementation is covered.</p>
<p>And I do think that should be the starting place</p>
<p>for any and all supplementation regimens.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say that once again.</p>
<p>I think covering your foundational needs</p>
<p>in the realm of vitamins, minerals, probiotics,</p>
<p>digestive enzymes, and adaptogens</p>
<p>is going to give you the most benefit by cost</p>
<p>and the most benefit across the board</p>
<p>in terms of brain and body systems</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to allow you to feel better overall,</p>
<p>sleep better overall, focus better overall,</p>
<p>and support all the different systems</p>
<p>in your brain and body</p>
<p>that are going to allow you to be at your best</p>
<p>while of course also paying careful attention</p>
<p>to your nutrition</p>
<p>because you simply cannot abandon nutrition.</p>
<p>Again, better living through chemistry</p>
<p>still requires better living.</p>
<p>So now that we&rsquo;ve had that discussion</p>
<p>about foundational supplementation,</p>
<p>and again, highlighting the fact</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s the one category of supplementation</p>
<p>where multi-ingredient formulations make the most sense,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to now shift our attention</p>
<p>to single ingredient formulation supplements</p>
<p>that are designed to achieve specific endpoints.</p>
<p>And here again, rather than focus on specific ingredients</p>
<p>and supplements to achieve specific endpoints</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve done that already in episodes</p>
<p>related to sleep and focus, et cetera,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a step back</p>
<p>and focus on the larger theme of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>which is how to think about supplementation</p>
<p>in a rational, cost-effective,</p>
<p>and biologically effective way</p>
<p>for each of these categories.</p>
<p>And the three categories that I&rsquo;m going to cover</p>
<p>are sleep, hormone support,</p>
<p>and cognitive enhancement and focus,</p>
<p>cognitive enhancement and focus</p>
<p>being the final third category.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about sleep and the rational approach</p>
<p>to thinking about supplementation for sleep.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier in this episode</p>
<p>and on many previous episodes of this podcast,</p>
<p>sleep is the foundation of mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>You might be somebody who can do an all-nighter</p>
<p>and feel okay the next day or maybe even great,</p>
<p>but most everybody,</p>
<p>once they start to have minimal sleep</p>
<p>for one or two nights in the form of broken sleep,</p>
<p>poor sleep, not enough sleep,</p>
<p>or sleeping at the wrong time of night,</p>
<p>there is such a thing, or day,</p>
<p>they start to suffer.</p>
<p>Their mood starts to suffer,</p>
<p>their cognitive clarity and performance starts to suffer,</p>
<p>their mental health can suffer severely,</p>
<p>and physical performance definitely suffers,</p>
<p>hormones suffer, everything suffers.</p>
<p>Conversely, when people are sleeping well,</p>
<p>that is deeply and enough,</p>
<p>80% of the nights of their life,</p>
<p>mental health, physical health, and performance all flourish,</p>
<p>and I think most people start to be almost amazed</p>
<p>at how well they&rsquo;re doing in various domains of life</p>
<p>that previously they might&rsquo;ve struggled with.</p>
<p>So sleep is fundamental, that&rsquo;s established.</p>
<p>When thinking about supplementation for sleep,</p>
<p>we need to ask ourselves a number of important questions.</p>
<p>First of all, you should ask yourself how well,</p>
<p>that is how deeply, and how much are you sleeping per night?</p>
<p>Assuming you&rsquo;re somebody who can fall asleep easily,</p>
<p>stay asleep through the night,</p>
<p>wake up feeling relatively rested, maybe a little groggy,</p>
<p>and then can move about your day</p>
<p>with plenty of energy and focus,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not falling asleep in class or at work</p>
<p>or behind the wheel,</p>
<p>or as a passenger on public transportation,</p>
<p>well, then you&rsquo;re probably getting enough sleep.</p>
<p>And by the way, it&rsquo;s perfectly normal</p>
<p>to require anywhere from a 10-minute</p>
<p>to a 90-minute nap in the afternoon for some people.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not a napper, no big deal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s known that naps can disrupt nighttime sleep,</p>
<p>but provided that they&rsquo;re early enough in the day,</p>
<p>if you take a nap and you are still able</p>
<p>to fall asleep at night, then naps are fine for you.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody who doesn&rsquo;t like naps</p>
<p>because you wake up groggy or grumpy,</p>
<p>which often happens to certain people, then don&rsquo;t nap.</p>
<p>You certainly do not need to nap.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re feeling energetic throughout the day,</p>
<p>chances are you&rsquo;re getting enough sleep at night.</p>
<p>But there are people, of course,</p>
<p>who are struggling with sleep,</p>
<p>either falling asleep, staying asleep,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re not feeling alert enough during the day</p>
<p>or all of the above.</p>
<p>And then it makes sense to step back</p>
<p>and take a look at what supplementation can provide.</p>
<p>If you are one of those people who is not sleeping enough</p>
<p>or well enough at night that you are suffering</p>
<p>during the day in whatever way, mild to severe,</p>
<p>there are two questions you should ask yourself.</p>
<p>First of all, are you ingesting caffeine after 2 p.m.?</p>
<p>If the answer is yes,</p>
<p>you want to limit or eliminate caffeine after 2 p.m.,</p>
<p>maybe even push it back to noon or earlier.</p>
<p>I know that can be excruciating for some folks,</p>
<p>but it can really help with your ability</p>
<p>to fall and stay asleep at night.</p>
<p>Second thing is, most people would do well</p>
<p>to avoid food within the two hours prior to bedtime.</p>
<p>But of course, you don&rsquo;t want to be so hungry</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t fall asleep, all right?</p>
<p>So those are the nutrition and behavioral tools</p>
<p>that everyone needs to consider.</p>
<p>If you are not ingesting caffeine 2 p.m. or onwards,</p>
<p>and you are not eating excessively immediately</p>
<p>prior to bedtime or within the two hours prior to bedtime,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not hungry when you go to sleep,</p>
<p>well, then there are certain supplements</p>
<p>that can support your sleep.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve talked about these in the Perfect Sleep episode</p>
<p>and in the episode with our guest expert, Matt Walker,</p>
<p>from University of California, Berkeley,</p>
<p>and in the Master Your Sleep episode.</p>
<p>And we have a toolkit for sleep</p>
<p>that you can access zero cost by going to humanlab.com</p>
<p>and going to the menu, go to the newsletter,</p>
<p>and you can find that toolkit.</p>

<p>But the point here is not to go systematically</p>
<p>through each of the supplements that is beneficial</p>
<p>or has been shown to be beneficial for sleep,</p>
<p>but rather to address specific aspects of sleep</p>
<p>that can suffer and why and how certain patterns</p>
<p>of supplementation can support</p>
<p>or alleviate those pain points.</p>
<p>If, for instance, you&rsquo;re somebody</p>
<p>who falls asleep just fine,</p>
<p>but wakes up in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>around two or 3 a.m. or any time for that matter,</p>
<p>and has trouble falling back asleep,</p>
<p>there are two categories of supplements</p>
<p>that you might want to consider.</p>
<p>The first is myoinositol,</p>
<p>typically taken as 900 milligrams of myoinositol.</p>
<p>Myoinositol can help shorten the amount of time</p>
<p>that it takes to fall back asleep</p>
<p>if you wake up in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Myoinositol has other beneficial uses as well</p>
<p>for mood, et cetera.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see many of the different effects</p>
<p>that have been explored in the scientific literature</p>
<p>for myoinositol, you can go to examine.com.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an excellent site, not just for inositol,</p>
<p>but for all supplements for that matter.</p>
<p>Talks about the human effect matrix,</p>
<p>that is the different effects</p>
<p>of different supplement compounds</p>
<p>on different aspects of hormone, brain, and body health,</p>
<p>where the evidence is strong, where the evidence is weak,</p>
<p>has links to studies, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s examine.com, amazing website,</p>
<p>wonderful website, it&rsquo;s provided such a rich resource</p>
<p>for me and for many, many other people.</p>
<p>Other people who wake up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>will wake up because their dreams are very intense,</p>
<p>or they were having dreams that were so vivid</p>
<p>that suddenly they were jolted from their dreams.</p>
<p>Those people would do well to avoid certain supplements.</p>
<p>So in a moment, I&rsquo;ll talk about the value</p>
<p>of a supplement called theanine for falling asleep.</p>
<p>But theanine, which typically is taken in dosages</p>
<p>anywhere from 100 milligrams to 400 milligrams,</p>
<p>depending on body weight and experience</p>
<p>and what you find to be most effective for you,</p>
<p>minimally effective for you.</p>
<p>Well, theanine can be great for many people,</p>
<p>but for people who have excessively vivid dreams,</p>
<p>those excessively vivid dreams can lead to immediate waking</p>
<p>and sometimes a little bit of anxiety</p>
<p>upon waking in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>So some people who wake up in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>so jolted mentally and physically out of sleep</p>
<p>because of their intense dreams</p>
<p>would do well to avoid theanine supplementation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about this a bit before,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s something that I think a lot of nighttime,</p>
<p>middle of the night wakers might be familiar with</p>
<p>and would want to take into consideration.</p>
<p>Now, for those of you that are not waking up</p>
<p>in the middle of the night</p>
<p>or not having excessively vivid dreams,</p>
<p>but are having trouble falling asleep,</p>
<p>two supplements in particular have been shown</p>
<p>to be effective for shortening the transition time to sleep</p>
<p>and allowing people to ease into sleep more readily.</p>
<p>And those are magnesium threonate,</p>
<p>which is interchangeable with magnesium bisglycinate.</p>
<p>Magnesium bisglycinate and magnesium threonate</p>
<p>both have transporter systems</p>
<p>that allow them to readily cross the blood-brain barrier</p>
<p>and they lead to a mild form of drowsiness,</p>
<p>mild in the sense that it&rsquo;s not going to prevent you</p>
<p>from operating a motor vehicle</p>
<p>or kind of any conditions under emergency</p>
<p>that might arise in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>or if they did arise during the middle of night,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d still be able to function,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not like a sleeping pill.</p>
<p>But people who take those often find</p>
<p>that their transition time into sleep is much faster</p>
<p>and their sleep is also much deeper.</p>
<p>Incidentally, those supplements are also thought</p>
<p>to be useful for cognitive support and neuroprotection,</p>
<p>although there&rsquo;s less data on that.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s for falling asleep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one category.</p>
<p>Either magnesium, magnesium threonate or bisglycinate</p>
<p>would be interchangeable</p>
<p>for assisting the transition time into sleep.</p>
<p>And then the other supplement is apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N,</p>
<p>apigenin, which is a derivative of chamomile.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about this in various podcasts before.</p>
<p>Also acts as a bit of a anxiety-lowering compound,</p>
<p>which is essential prior to sleep</p>
<p>for people to essentially turn off their thinking</p>
<p>or to be able to reduce the amount of ruminating</p>
<p>and problem-solving and future anticipation</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>which is a requirement for falling asleep.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the rational approach to supplementing</p>
<p>in a way that allows you to fall asleep more quickly</p>
<p>and stay asleep?</p>
<p>Well, would you immediately take magnesium threonate</p>
<p>and apigenin together?</p>
<p>Well, that depends.</p>
<p>If you have the budget</p>
<p>and you just simply want to fall asleep quicker</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t care which of those two ingredients</p>
<p>is going to be more effective for you,</p>
<p>well, then you could try one,</p>
<p>for instance, magnesium threonate,</p>
<p>and try it for perhaps a week</p>
<p>and see how that affects your latency to sleep time.</p>
<p>That is how quickly you fall asleep.</p>
<p>Or you could try apigenin in the first week,</p>
<p>or you could combine them both,</p>
<p>or you could try magnesium threonate for a week,</p>
<p>then switch to only apigenin for a week</p>
<p>and evaluate which one works better for you.</p>
<p>If neither works for you,</p>
<p>I do recommend trying the combination together.</p>
<p>Again, this is just the way that any scientist</p>
<p>would design an experiment</p>
<p>to try and understand which variables,</p>
<p>that is, which ingredients are most effective</p>
<p>for the result that you want,</p>
<p>as opposed to just lumping them together and taking them.</p>
<p>That said, a lot of people want excellent sleep so badly</p>
<p>that they just say, okay,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to take magnesium threonate,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to take apigenin, I&rsquo;m going to take theanine.</p>
<p>If my dreams are too vivid</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m waking up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>from excessively vivid dreams, I&rsquo;ll drop the theanine.</p>
<p>And many people actually derive great benefit</p>
<p>from that approach.</p>
<p>But because today we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about the most rational, cost-effective,</p>
<p>and biologically effective approach to supplementation,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not sleeping as well as you would like to,</p>
<p>or if you want to explore what sleeping even more deeply</p>
<p>might do for your mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance,</p>
<p>well, then it makes sense to think about</p>
<p>the various supplements for falling asleep</p>
<p>versus remaining asleep, what to include,</p>
<p>what not to include, and to do that systematically.</p>
<p>And again, I think one week&rsquo;s time of taking something,</p>
<p>provided it doesn&rsquo;t induce any negative effects, right?</p>
<p>If something induces a negative effect,</p>
<p>I recommend ceasing taking it immediately.</p>
<p>But if something does not produce any negative effects,</p>
<p>then I think you want to try a single ingredient formulation</p>
<p>for about a week while not varying anything else,</p>
<p>not changing anything else in your overall protocols</p>
<p>of nutrition or supplementation.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s impossible to clamp everything perfectly</p>
<p>from week to week,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t change anything else dramatically</p>
<p>and just add that supplement for a given week,</p>
<p>see how it benefits your sleep.</p>
<p>Maybe add in a second supplement if you like,</p>
<p>or rather swap and try a different supplement for a week</p>
<p>and then see what works best</p>
<p>and see if the combination works even better.</p>
<p>Now, I acknowledge that what I just described</p>
<p>is exceedingly basic,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s something that I don&rsquo;t think most people do.</p>
<p>Most people either decide they have the budget</p>
<p>and the interest</p>
<p>in just improving their sleep across the board,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t care what ingredient</p>
<p>is providing the maximum benefit,</p>
<p>or they simply try something and decide,</p>
<p>oh, well, it didn&rsquo;t work for me,</p>
<p>and so I&rsquo;m not going to try anything else.</p>
<p>Supplements don&rsquo;t work for me,</p>
<p>or magnesium doesn&rsquo;t work for me,</p>
<p>or I woke up in the middle of the night from vivid dreams,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>more of a shotgun approach</p>
<p>without teasing out the different variables.</p>
<p>In fact, if there&rsquo;s an overriding theme</p>
<p>of today&rsquo;s conversation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really about learning how to isolate variables</p>
<p>in the realm of supplementation,</p>
<p>because once you do that,</p>
<p>and once you start to develop that intuition</p>
<p>or sensitivity of sorts</p>
<p>to how different ingredients impact you,</p>
<p>it is an enormously powerful stance to have</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re going to keep your costs limited.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also going to find the things</p>
<p>that work particularly poorly for you,</p>
<p>and more importantly,</p>
<p>the things that work particularly well for you</p>
<p>toward your goals.</p>
<p>Any discussion about supplementation for sleep?</p>
<p>I feel has to include a discussion about melatonin.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about melatonin before on numerous podcasts,</p>
<p>mine and others,</p>
<p>and I will say once again,</p>
<p>I am not a fan of melatonin for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>Melatonin is a hormone known to induce sleepiness,</p>
<p>but not keep us asleep,</p>
<p>so oftentimes people will take melatonin,</p>
<p>fall deeply asleep, and then wake up,</p>
<p>and have trouble falling back asleep.</p>
<p>The other reason is that melatonin supplements</p>
<p>almost always include levels of melatonin</p>
<p>or amounts of melatonin that far, far exceed</p>
<p>the normal biological levels</p>
<p>or so-called endogenous levels of melatonin</p>
<p>that we would normally produce.</p>
<p>And yes, it&rsquo;s true that as we age,</p>
<p>we produce less melatonin,</p>
<p>but melatonin as a hormone also impacts</p>
<p>other hormone systems,</p>
<p>in particular, the reproductive hormone axis,</p>
<p>testosterone, estrogen, et cetera,</p>
<p>which is not to say that if you&rsquo;ve been taking melatonin</p>
<p>for some period of time</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve disrupted your fertility or those hormone axes,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s possible that you&rsquo;ve disrupted them somewhat,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very clear that melatonin can impact</p>
<p>not just sleep, but other systems in the brain and body.</p>
<p>It can be useful for jet lag and for occasional use,</p>
<p>but there also, I want to voice a message of caution.</p>
<p>There have been studies exploring</p>
<p>the dosages of melatonin contained in various supplements</p>
<p>and whether or not what&rsquo;s listed on the bottle matches</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s actually contained in those formulations.</p>
<p>And despite those formulations coming from quite reliable,</p>
<p>quote unquote, or thought to be reliable sources,</p>
<p>it was found that these supplements contain</p>
<p>anywhere from 15% of what&rsquo;s thought to be</p>
<p>or is told to be in those supplements,</p>
<p>or many times more melatonin than is listed on the bottle.</p>
<p>So the dosaging does not seem to be consistent</p>
<p>with what&rsquo;s often listed on the bottle.</p>
<p>And this is even true</p>
<p>within some of the more reputable brands.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s of real concern.</p>
<p>So we need to highlight melatonin</p>
<p>as perhaps something that&rsquo;s only used occasionally.</p>
<p>If you want to talk about dosages for melatonin use</p>
<p>for jet lag, et cetera, go to examine.com.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some excellent references to studies there.</p>
<p>Just put melatonin into the search function.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll tell you everything you need to know about melatonin,</p>
<p>but now you know my stance on melatonin.</p>
<p>One question I often get about supplementation for sleep</p>
<p>is does it create a dependency?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an excellent question to ask.</p>
<p>I think most people worry about, even fear,</p>
<p>relying on something so heavily</p>
<p>that if they did not have it for whatever reason</p>
<p>that they couldn&rsquo;t sleep.</p>
<p>In my experience, there is no problem</p>
<p>falling and staying asleep</p>
<p>in the absence of a supplement for sleep,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;ve been taking that supplement for sleep</p>
<p>consistently, seven days a week for months and months,</p>
<p>maybe even years on end.</p>
<p>I confess that I occasionally fall asleep</p>
<p>having not taken my pre-sleep supplements.</p>
<p>And I happen to take magnesium 3 and 8,</p>
<p>theanine and apigenin.</p>
<p>I also take inositol.</p>
<p>It greatly enhances my sleep.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;ve been nights when I&rsquo;ve fallen asleep</p>
<p>not having taken any of those things and I&rsquo;ve slept fine.</p>
<p>That said, if I were to explore multiple nights</p>
<p>of trying to sleep without that supplementation,</p>
<p>I find that my sleep is not as good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still able to fall asleep,</p>
<p>but the depth of my sleep and the duration of my sleep</p>
<p>is not as good as when I&rsquo;m supplementing.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s refreshing news, at least to me,</p>
<p>that there isn&rsquo;t a dependence on these supplements</p>
<p>in order to be able to fall asleep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the same sort of dependence that people experience</p>
<p>from things like sleeping pills.</p>
<p>That said, any compound, any compound</p>
<p>can create a placebo type effect</p>
<p>where we think we need something</p>
<p>in order to achieve a certain effect.</p>
<p>We had a guest on this podcast some time ago,</p>
<p>Dr. Ali Crum, who&rsquo;s a professor at Stanford</p>
<p>and works on these mindset effects,</p>
<p>belief effects, and placebo effects.</p>
<p>And placebo effects can be very real</p>
<p>and in some sense dovetail</p>
<p>with any conversation about dependency.</p>
<p>Meaning if you are somebody who loves your sleep supplements</p>
<p>and sleeps great with them,</p>
<p>and one night you discover you don&rsquo;t have them</p>
<p>or you can&rsquo;t access them for whatever reason,</p>
<p>that can create a little bit of an anxiety</p>
<p>around the idea that, oh, in their absence,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to be able to sleep.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a sort of a placebo effect in reverse,</p>
<p>if you will, because what it suggests is that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a emotional or a cognitive association</p>
<p>with taking these things that allows you to sleep well.</p>
<p>I would highly recommend that people explore this issue</p>
<p>of dependency and placebo effects for sleep supplements</p>
<p>on their own and under conditions</p>
<p>in which there&rsquo;s nothing pressing the next day.</p>
<p>That is, you don&rsquo;t have a big presentation, et cetera.</p>
<p>So what I recommend is that every two weeks or so,</p>
<p>maybe every month or so,</p>
<p>take one night off completely from all your sleep supplements</p>
<p>or leave out one sleep supplement.</p>
<p>Try to understand to what extent</p>
<p>you might&rsquo;ve established a dependency,</p>
<p>either real or placebo-based on these sleep supplements.</p>
<p>And again, I suggest doing this on perhaps a Friday night</p>
<p>so that it&rsquo;s a weekend the next day</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t have to work if perhaps you don&rsquo;t sleep well.</p>
<p>I think what you&rsquo;ll find is what most people find.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s in the absence of taking</p>
<p>your supplement stack for sleep one night,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still going to sleep just fine.</p>
<p>Now, does that mean that these supplements</p>
<p>are not actually working under normal conditions</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re taking them each night?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>What this means is that many of these things,</p>
<p>magnesiums in particular, can build up in the body</p>
<p>and brain in a way that can be beneficial.</p>
<p>And what probably explains the fact</p>
<p>that you can still sleep if you miss a night of taking them</p>
<p>is that the neural circuits that are involved</p>
<p>in turning off thinking or in not thinking</p>
<p>and in falling asleep,</p>
<p>those neural circuits undergo what&rsquo;s called plasticity.</p>
<p>In other words, if you get better at falling</p>
<p>and staying asleep over time,</p>
<p>even if you got better at that through the assistance</p>
<p>or with the assistance of some supplement</p>
<p>or combination of supplements,</p>
<p>well, then those circuits are still going to function</p>
<p>just fine, even in the absence</p>
<p>of not taking those supplements just once.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get back into this conversation a little bit later</p>
<p>when we talk about cognitive enhancement and focus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same story there,</p>
<p>where indeed there are things that people can take</p>
<p>in stimulant form and non-stimulant form</p>
<p>that can enhance cognitive ability and focus,</p>
<p>but that does not mean that you become so dependent</p>
<p>on those that you can&rsquo;t focus unless you take them.</p>
<p>This has been shown multiple times over.</p>
<p>So again, to answer the question,</p>
<p>is there a dependency established</p>
<p>by taking supplements for sleep?</p>
<p>The short answer is no,</p>
<p>with the caveat that placebo effects and belief effects</p>
<p>are always going to be at play,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re talking about supplementation,</p>
<p>prescription drugs,</p>
<p>or even behavioral protocols for that matter.</p>

<p>to claim their special offer in the month of January</p>
<p>of 10 free travel packs,</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3, K2.</p>
<p>The next category of supplementation</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d like to talk about is hormone support.</p>
<p>Improving or so-called optimizing your hormones</p>
<p>is a critical aspect of mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done multiple episodes about hormones,</p>
<p>including testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>for both men and women and for people of different ages.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also had episodes on thyroid hormone,</p>
<p>growth hormone, and so on.</p>
<p>You can find all those at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>In fact, you can go to the hubermanlab.com website.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a search function</p>
<p>where you can just put in a keyword</p>
<p>and it will take you to all the episodes</p>
<p>and specific time points</p>
<p>where that topic happens to be covered.</p>
<p>Now, hormone health is such an important topic to discuss</p>
<p>in the context of supplementation</p>
<p>because indeed there are compounds</p>
<p>that are non-prescription based, so-called supplements,</p>
<p>that can improve hormone function.</p>
<p>Again, anytime we are discussing a particular aspect</p>
<p>of mental health, physical health, or performance,</p>
<p>we need to start with a mention of the few behavioral tools</p>
<p>and nutrition-based tools,</p>
<p>or at least some top contour coverage of those</p>
<p>in a way that frames up the discussion</p>
<p>about supplementation appropriately.</p>
<p>So in the context of hormone support</p>
<p>and augmentation and optimization,</p>
<p>if you are not getting adequate calories</p>
<p>from high-quality sources,</p>
<p>hormones like testosterone and estrogen will suffer.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons</p>
<p>why women will stop having their periods</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re not ingesting enough calories.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons</p>
<p>why testosterone levels will drop</p>
<p>if people are not ingesting enough calories.</p>
<p>In fact, on the episode with expert guest</p>
<p>and medical doctor Peter Atiyah,</p>
<p>he described how sex hormone-binding globulin,</p>
<p>this is a protein that&rsquo;s present in males and females</p>
<p>that binds to testosterone and other hormones</p>
<p>and prevents it from being in its free form,</p>
<p>which is the more active form.</p>
<p>Well, insulin, which of course is going to increase</p>
<p>after the ingestion of carbohydrates in particular,</p>
<p>insulin actually inhibits</p>
<p>or reduces sex hormone-binding globulin.</p>
<p>What this means is that for you intermittent fasters</p>
<p>or people that are ingesting very few carbohydrates</p>
<p>who have very low blood glucose,</p>
<p>or perhaps are taking things like metformin or berberine,</p>
<p>which is a supplement-based approach</p>
<p>to reducing blood glucose,</p>
<p>well, your sex hormone-binding globulin</p>
<p>is going to increase dramatically.</p>
<p>Conversely, if you are eating enough calories</p>
<p>in the form of foods that allow your insulin</p>
<p>to be a bit higher, not excessively high, we hope,</p>
<p>but a bit higher,</p>
<p>well, then sex hormone-binding globulin will go down</p>
<p>and free testosterone will go up.</p>
<p>So the discussion about hormone support and augmentation</p>
<p>has to include some nod toward</p>
<p>or understanding of the fact that nutrition</p>
<p>and the way that nutrition impacts hormones</p>
<p>and the way that hormones such as insulin</p>
<p>impact other hormones such as free testosterone,</p>
<p>that all has to be acknowledged.</p>
<p>That is not the topic of today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s important that I remind everybody</p>
<p>that nutrition matters for general hormone status.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also important to remember</p>
<p>that behaviors matter for hormone status.</p>
<p>Getting morning sunlight increases cortisol levels.</p>
<p>Cortisol levels are very important</p>
<p>to have elevated early in the day for focus and alertness</p>
<p>and for immune function,</p>
<p>and to make sure that cortisol levels are low at night</p>
<p>and thereby levels of growth hormone and testosterone,</p>
<p>which is secreted mainly in the early morning,</p>
<p>can be elevated at night and in the early morning.</p>
<p>So getting morning sunlight,</p>
<p>getting strenuous exercise</p>
<p>in the form of both cardiovascular exercise,</p>
<p>but also relatively short,</p>
<p>meaning an hour or less bouts</p>
<p>of intense resistance training a few times per week</p>
<p>can also dramatically alter hormone profiles.</p>
<p>In fact, in the episode that we did with Dr. Duncan French,</p>
<p>again, you find that episode at hubermanlab.com,</p>
<p>he described a very strenuous,</p>
<p>but still brief two-day-a-week protocol</p>
<p>of using resistance training</p>
<p>specifically to increase testosterone</p>
<p>and free testosterone and growth hormone, and so on.</p>
<p>So nutrition matters, exercise matters</p>
<p>when it comes to increasing, supporting,</p>
<p>or augmenting different hormones,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s just the discussion about testosterone,</p>
<p>free testosterone, and estrogen.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the vast discussion</p>
<p>about thyroid hormone, et cetera.</p>
<p>Again, we&rsquo;ve covered all those topics in previous episodes,</p>
<p>but once those behavioral tools are in place,</p>
<p>once you&rsquo;re doing the right things</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re avoiding the wrong things,</p>
<p>doing the right things to support your hormones</p>
<p>and avoiding the things that diminish hormones</p>
<p>in the ways that can be detrimental,</p>
<p>once your nutrition is in place to support your hormones,</p>
<p>then it makes sense to turn and consider</p>
<p>what supplements can support hormones.</p>
<p>But I do believe that you want to get your behaviors</p>
<p>and your nutrition correct</p>
<p>before you start thinking about supplementation for hormones.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;ll repeat that.</p>
<p>Get your nutrition and your behaviors correct</p>
<p>for sake of hormones and for other health purposes</p>
<p>before you start thinking about supplementation for hormones</p>
<p>and certainly before you start thinking</p>
<p>about prescription-based approaches to improving hormones.</p>
<p>Once all of those other elements are in place,</p>
<p>the supplements that make sense</p>
<p>in terms of augmenting hormones come in two forms.</p>
<p>One are broadband support for multiple hormones,</p>
<p>and then the others are supplements</p>
<p>that are designed to increase,</p>
<p>or in some cases decrease,</p>
<p>specific hormones or hormone pathways.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s consider each of those in tandem.</p>
<p>There are certain supplements,</p>
<p>things like Shilajit, for instance,</p>
<p>something from Ayurvedic medicine,</p>
<p>which mainly has the active ingredient fulvic acid,</p>
<p>which is known to, for instance,</p>
<p>increase things like FSH, follicle-stimulating hormone,</p>
<p>which in women is going to increase</p>
<p>certain aspects of egg growth,</p>
<p>hence the name follicle-stimulating hormone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to stimulate certain aspects of fertility.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pro-fertile, and in males can make</p>
<p>for more sperm production or more motile sperm.</p>
<p>FSH is also going to indirectly</p>
<p>increase testosterone in males.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s known to increase libido in both males and females.</p>
<p>So things like Shilajit can indeed augment multiple hormones</p>
<p>and support multiple hormone systems,</p>
<p>generally in the direction of pro-fertility, pro-libido,</p>
<p>and increasing estrogen and testosterone.</p>
<p>Now, there are other supplements such as Ashwagandha</p>
<p>that also fall into this category</p>
<p>of affecting multiple hormones.</p>
<p>Ashwagandha is a very potent supplement</p>
<p>in terms of reducing cortisol levels.</p>
<p>It has also been shown to increase testosterone levels,</p>
<p>but probably indirectly,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because cortisol and testosterone</p>
<p>sort of exist on a seesaw in terms of pathways.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re on separate pathways,</p>
<p>but those pathways interact enough</p>
<p>that when cortisol is lowered in general,</p>
<p>testosterone tends to increase.</p>
<p>Now, it is important that with certain hormones</p>
<p>like Ashwagandha that you don&rsquo;t take them</p>
<p>for more than two weeks at a time at high dosages.</p>
<p>If you want to know more of the specifics around Ashwagandha</p>
<p>and how long to take it, how to cycle it, et cetera,</p>
<p>please see our episode on master stress.</p>
<p>Please also see the examine.com website</p>
<p>and put in Ashwagandha.</p>
<p>It will get into some of that description.</p>
<p>But Shilajit, Ashwagandha,</p>
<p>and things for instance, like L-carnitine,</p>
<p>a supplement that we often discuss in terms of fertility</p>
<p>because it can indeed improve sperm motility</p>
<p>and quality and egg quality.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a pro-fertile compound,</p>
<p>but it also impacts various mitochondrial pathways.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s having a more indirect effect on hormones.</p>
<p>There are many other compounds present</p>
<p>and available supplements that are purported</p>
<p>to be pro-hormone support, in particular for testosterone,</p>
<p>estrogen, fertility, and libido.</p>
<p>There is a description, for instance,</p>
<p>of things like maca root.</p>
<p>Maca root can increase libido.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s found to be particularly effective in women,</p>
<p>but in men as well, and in all people</p>
<p>who are suffering from lowered libido</p>
<p>due to intake of SSRIs,</p>
<p>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,</p>
<p>for whatever reason.</p>
<p>SSRIs are used to treat OCD.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re used to treat depression,</p>
<p>any number of different things.</p>
<p>Maca root can be, in many instances,</p>
<p>effective in increasing libido.</p>
<p>It does that, however,</p>
<p>through augmentation of dopamine-related pathways</p>
<p>and some of the hormone pathways</p>
<p>upstream of testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>The reports that maca increases testosterone</p>
<p>are somewhat scant and a little bit weak, to be honest.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s having these indirect effects</p>
<p>that may impact testosterone downstream.</p>
<p>So again, I&rsquo;d put maca alongside ashwagandha,</p>
<p>alongside shilajit as supplements</p>
<p>that are impacting multiple hormone pathways</p>
<p>toward increased libido, increased fertility,</p>
<p>increased testosterone or estrogen,</p>
<p>likely through indirect pathways.</p>
<p>Okay, now with all that said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to provide some examples of supplements</p>
<p>that work more directly on specific hormone pathways</p>
<p>aimed at achieving more specific goals,</p>
<p>such as elevated testosterone</p>
<p>or elevated free testosterone</p>
<p>or elevated growth hormone, for that matter,</p>
<p>and elevated thyroid hormone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to talk about growth hormone first</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s actually a pretty short discussion.</p>
<p>First of all, the best way to augment growth hormone</p>
<p>is to get quality deep sleep,</p>
<p>especially the sleep that occurs</p>
<p>in the first three or four hours of the night</p>
<p>is when growth hormone is released.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to be beneficial to avoid caloric intake</p>
<p>in the two hours preceding sleep.</p>
<p>Again, don&rsquo;t go to bed so hungry</p>
<p>that you wake up an hour or an hour and a half later</p>
<p>you have trouble falling asleep,</p>
<p>but avoiding food intake in the two hours prior to sleep</p>
<p>and certainly avoiding alcohol and cannabis</p>
<p>is going to facilitate growth hormone release</p>
<p>in the first hours of sleep.</p>
<p>Many people use intermittent fasting</p>
<p>or even longer periods of fasting</p>
<p>to increase growth hormone.</p>
<p>One of the interesting things I learned</p>
<p>from an expert guest, Dr. Kyle Gillette,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a medical doctor on this podcast</p>
<p>is that indeed while lengthier fast or intermittent fasting</p>
<p>can increase growth hormone levels very substantially,</p>
<p>it has indirect effects on the genetic pathways</p>
<p>and the receptors for growth hormone</p>
<p>that actually are detrimental</p>
<p>for the function of growth hormone.</p>
<p>So avoiding food for the two hours prior to bedtime</p>
<p>is a good idea.</p>
<p>If you avoid food for longer,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just going to assist even more,</p>
<p>certainly isn&rsquo;t going to hurt</p>
<p>in terms of growth hormone release,</p>
<p>but extended fast specifically</p>
<p>for the purpose of increasing growth hormone</p>
<p>are not really logical</p>
<p>when you look at the broader effects of extended fast.</p>
<p>That is not to say that extended fasting</p>
<p>is not appropriate for some people,</p>
<p>it can be in certain instances,</p>
<p>or that intermittent fasted,</p>
<p>so-called time-restricted feeding</p>
<p>is not beneficial for some people, it can be.</p>
<p>Here, I&rsquo;m only referring to the effects</p>
<p>or in this case, the lack of effects</p>
<p>of intermittent fasting, time-restricted feeding</p>
<p>on growth hormone specifically.</p>
<p>Now, in terms of supplements to increase growth hormone,</p>
<p>there are very few supplements</p>
<p>that have been shown to augment this pathway.</p>
<p>There is some idea that arginine supplementation</p>
<p>prior to bedtime can further elevate</p>
<p>levels of growth hormone, especially when fasted.</p>
<p>That literature is rather weak, to be honest.</p>
<p>I encourage you to go to examine.com</p>
<p>if you want to peruse those particular studies.</p>
<p>Really, the things that increase growth hormone</p>
<p>very potently fall outside the realm of supplementation.</p>
<p>They include exercise.</p>
<p>Again, look at the Duncan French episode</p>
<p>or in the Kyle Gillette episode</p>
<p>on optimizing hormones in males in particular,</p>
<p>but this also pertains to females</p>
<p>that avoiding food two hours prior to bedtime</p>
<p>really can boost growth hormone significantly in sleep</p>
<p>beyond what it would be otherwise.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really only once you get into the realm</p>
<p>of prescription compounds,</p>
<p>things like peptides like sermorelin,</p>
<p>which increase IGF-1 and growth hormone,</p>
<p>things like growth hormone itself by prescription,</p>
<p>and only if it&rsquo;s prescribed by a doctor, of course,</p>
<p>and is safe for you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you start getting into</p>
<p>really significant increases in growth hormone.</p>
<p>Not a lot of supplements out there</p>
<p>to increase growth hormone potently.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s a different story when you start thinking about</p>
<p>and talking about testosterone and free testosterone</p>
<p>and luteinizing hormone.</p>
<p>Luteinizing hormone is released from the pituitary,</p>
<p>which is this gland not far from the roof of your mouth,</p>
<p>and its nearby neighbor, the hypothalamus</p>
<p>is a collection of neurons</p>
<p>that sits above the roof of your mouth</p>
<p>and talks to the pituitary,</p>
<p>talks to it through neural connections</p>
<p>and hormone-based connections.</p>
<p>There is a hormone called GNRH,</p>
<p>gonadotropin-releasing hormone,</p>
<p>that is released from the hypothalamus into the pituitary.</p>
<p>It stimulates the release of luteinizing hormone, or LH,</p>
<p>which then travels in the bloodstream</p>
<p>to impact multiple tissues in the body,</p>
<p>but mainly the ovary in females and the testes in males</p>
<p>to stimulate estrogen production and testosterone production.</p>
<p>There are supplements that can potently increase GNRH</p>
<p>and or luteinizing hormone,</p>
<p>and then indirectly increase testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>And I always like to remind people,</p>
<p>testosterone and estrogen are present</p>
<p>in both males and females, okay?</p>
<p>And both are important for things like libido,</p>
<p>muscle growth, and so on.</p>
<p>A lot of people think that, oh, in males,</p>
<p>having very high testosterone and low estrogen</p>
<p>is actually ideal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually not ideal if you want to keep your libido.</p>
<p>Anything that lowers your estrogen too far</p>
<p>is going to reduce your libido.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want estrogen too high,</p>
<p>but you also do not want it too low.</p>
<p>So supplements that can tickle this pathway</p>
<p>or actually can act as a bit more of a directed hammer</p>
<p>on this luteinizing hormone pathway</p>
<p>may also impact GNRH are things like phytogia agrestis.</p>
<p>This is an herb that I&rsquo;ve talked about before on the podcast</p>
<p>that when taken at dosages of 600 milligrams per day,</p>
<p>many people, not all, report elevated levels of libido,</p>
<p>elevated sperm production, elevated testosterone,</p>
<p>in some cases, elevated estrogen,</p>
<p>a bunch of hormones downstream of luteinizing hormone.</p>
<p>Now, are you going to be a phytogia agrestis responder</p>
<p>or a non-responder?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s simply no way to know except by trying it.</p>
<p>If you are going to go down this route,</p>
<p>there are two very important considerations.</p>
<p>First of all, there&rsquo;s a fairly extensive literature</p>
<p>on the fact that phytogia agrestis can be toxic</p>
<p>to testicular cells and perhaps other cells</p>
<p>when taken at very high dosages.</p>
<p>So obeying the particular dosages of phytogia agrestis</p>
<p>that are recommended on various product labels</p>
<p>and cycling phytogia agrestis can be important.</p>
<p>Some people need to cycle it eight weeks on, two weeks off.</p>
<p>Other people opt for 12 weeks on, a month off.</p>
<p>I know a few people who have taken it continuously</p>
<p>with no issues, but I do want to suggest caution</p>
<p>when taking phytogia agrestis.</p>
<p>The cautionary notes are,</p>
<p>stay within the recommended dosage ranges.</p>
<p>You can go lower, but certainly don&rsquo;t go higher.</p>
<p>And I think it is wise to cycle every eight weeks or so</p>
<p>to come off it for two weeks and then going back on,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s your choice, if you feel it benefited you,</p>
<p>or taking it for 12 week periods of time</p>
<p>and then cycling off for a full month</p>
<p>before repeating again.</p>
<p>The best way to know whether or not phytogia</p>
<p>or any of these other supplements</p>
<p>is impacting your hormone levels</p>
<p>in the direction that you want</p>
<p>and not impacting your hormone levels</p>
<p>or other aspects of your biology</p>
<p>in ways that you don&rsquo;t want is from a blood test.</p>
<p>There is simply no better tool to evaluate</p>
<p>whether or not these supplements are working</p>
<p>to support your hormones in the ways that you want</p>
<p>and not causing issues, except to take a blood test.</p>
<p>This podcast has InsideTracker as a sponsor</p>
<p>that can do in-home blood tests and give you blood panels.</p>
<p>There are other sources of blood tests</p>
<p>that are quite good as well, of course.</p>
<p>And in the first episode of the Huberman Lab podcast</p>
<p>that I did with Dr. Kyle Gillette,</p>
<p>again, a medical doctor, expert in hormones, diabetes,</p>
<p>and various other aspects of medicine,</p>
<p>he described, and it is timestamped,</p>
<p>how to stand the best probability</p>
<p>of getting your insurance to cover a blood test,</p>
<p>how to talk to your doctor</p>
<p>about getting a hormone panel, and so on.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll refer you to that episode for that.</p>
<p>But blood tests are going to be very important.</p>
<p>I recommend taking them before adding in any supplement</p>
<p>to increase hormones of any kind</p>
<p>or decrease hormones of any kind for that matter.</p>
<p>And then again, after about four to eight weeks</p>
<p>of taking that particular supplement</p>
<p>in order to evaluate whether or not it worked</p>
<p>and whether or not it had any negative effects</p>
<p>that you would like to avoid.</p>
<p>I also want to remind people</p>
<p>of the dosage conversation that we had earlier.</p>
<p>Just because there&rsquo;s a recommended dosage</p>
<p>of phytogeogrestis of say 600 milligrams per day.</p>
<p>First of all, that is not an invitation</p>
<p>to take twice as much and expect twice the positive effects.</p>
<p>That is not a good approach,</p>
<p>especially with something like phytogeogrestis,</p>
<p>which can at high dosages be toxic.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also important to perhaps consider</p>
<p>taking a lower dosage</p>
<p>and seeing how that affects your hormones.</p>
<p>That approach requires a bit more patience.</p>
<p>I know most people are thinking,</p>
<p>I want the effect and I want it now.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s very important when thinking</p>
<p>about exercise or nutrition or supplementation</p>
<p>to really play the long game,</p>
<p>to think about what&rsquo;s going to work for you</p>
<p>in the immediate end in the longterm</p>
<p>and to ease into any kind of supplement regimen.</p>
<p>For instance, by taking one thing at a time,</p>
<p>varying one supplement out and one supplement in,</p>
<p>starting at minimal effective dose</p>
<p>and build up your protocols over a year or several years,</p>
<p>it really can be beneficial.</p>
<p>I can say for myself,</p>
<p>I started exploring the supplement space</p>
<p>and taking different supplements in different combination</p>
<p>and alone evaluating which ones worked</p>
<p>and did not work for me.</p>
<p>Some were absolutely dreadful for me.</p>
<p>I have tons of stories about supplement fails,</p>
<p>some of which were just kind of innocuous,</p>
<p>meaning they were a waste of money, which isn&rsquo;t innocuous,</p>
<p>but at least it wasn&rsquo;t detrimental to my health.</p>
<p>Other supplements, which fortunately don&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>on the market anymore,</p>
<p>I think actually were quite dangerous</p>
<p>and I feel lucky that I did not experience</p>
<p>even greater negative effects from them.</p>
<p>Other supplements have been tremendously useful</p>
<p>for me and for other people,</p>
<p>for things like sleep and hormone support,</p>
<p>focus and so on.</p>
<p>So Fidogia aggressis is a good example</p>
<p>of a supplement that is known to have potent effects,</p>
<p>but you need to approach it with the appropriate,</p>
<p>I would say respect for the fact that the dosage ranges</p>
<p>in which it works have to be kept pretty narrow</p>
<p>without causing issues.</p>
<p>It does increase luteinizing hormone</p>
<p>and thereby testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s already excessively high</p>
<p>in one or the other,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be very hard to just direct it</p>
<p>to only testosterone or only estrogen.</p>
<p>Now, the topic of today&rsquo;s episode</p>
<p>is not about Fidogia aggressis per se.</p>
<p>I highlight it because it is one of the more potent</p>
<p>supplements for sake of hormone augmentation,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still fairly broadband.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little more specific than something like Shilajit,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still fairly broadband</p>
<p>in terms of hitting multiple end point hormones,</p>
<p>testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>and maybe some other hormones as well.</p>
<p>There are other supplements in particular Tongat Ali,</p>
<p>which is known to, for instance, increase libido,</p>
<p>whether or not it does that</p>
<p>by way of augmenting dopamine related pathways</p>
<p>or testosterone pathways still isn&rsquo;t clear.</p>
<p>It is known to increase free testosterone</p>
<p>by reducing sex hormone binding globulin.</p>
<p>Tongat Ali can be beneficial both for men and for women</p>
<p>in dosages anywhere from 200 milligrams</p>
<p>to 600 milligrams per day.</p>
<p>So there, I would say scale according to body size,</p>
<p>although start with the minimum amount</p>
<p>and find the minimal effective dose for you.</p>
<p>Again, blood work is going to be the most effective way</p>
<p>to determine what&rsquo;s working or not working</p>
<p>at the level of objective numbers,</p>
<p>but subjective experience matters too.</p>
<p>You know, if you take it at 400 milligrams for four weeks</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t notice any effect,</p>
<p>you might try it at 600 milligrams, but not higher.</p>
<p>And if you still don&rsquo;t see an effect,</p>
<p>well, then it doesn&rsquo;t appear to have worked for you.</p>
<p>Other people experience dramatic effects</p>
<p>from things like Fidogia and Tongat Ali.</p>
<p>Why would that be the case?</p>
<p>Well, if you look to the scientific literature,</p>
<p>what you find is that the studies</p>
<p>that report the biggest effects of any supplement</p>
<p>usually start with a population</p>
<p>that somehow diminished or back on its heels</p>
<p>in one particular dimension.</p>
<p>So for instance, people that are hypogonadal,</p>
<p>that are not making enough testosterone or free testosterone,</p>
<p>in fact, their levels are very, very low.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re subclinical, off range in terms of the charts,</p>
<p>below the normal.</p>
<p>Well, those people, when they take supplements</p>
<p>like Tongat Ali, Fidogia,</p>
<p>tend to experience greater effects</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re starting from a lower level</p>
<p>than people who perhaps are close to the optimal levels.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an important thing to think about.</p>
<p>These are called floor effects and ceiling effects.</p>
<p>Ceiling effects are, for instance,</p>
<p>if an individual already has very high testosterone</p>
<p>and free testosterone,</p>
<p>and they take a supplement to increase it further,</p>
<p>they might not see any increase.</p>
<p>Whereas somebody who sits more in the middle to low range</p>
<p>stands to experience a much greater increase.</p>
<p>In fact, one individual I know who took Tongat Ali,</p>
<p>admittedly on my recommendation,</p>
<p>his testosterone levels were much higher</p>
<p>than he was on my recommendation.</p>
<p>His testosterone was initially very low</p>
<p>and he was having a number of different symptoms.</p>
<p>He did blood work, that&rsquo;s how he knew it was low.</p>
<p>And he then took Tongat Ali and Fidogia in combination</p>
<p>because he decided he just wanted results.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t care which thing was going to give him the results.</p>
<p>And he experienced big increases in testosterone.</p>
<p>This would be not free, but total testosterone.</p>
<p>He experienced as much as 600 nanograms per deciliter</p>
<p>increase from where he was before, which is very dramatic.</p>
<p>It was a near tripling of where his testosterone</p>
<p>had started off to where he ended up.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s ever done the experiment</p>
<p>of removing Fidogia or Tongat to find out which one it was.</p>
<p>And this is why many people just take them in combination.</p>
<p>And if you have the budget for it</p>
<p>and you are interested in just finding what works,</p>
<p>but not isolating what works</p>
<p>at the level of single ingredients,</p>
<p>that would be the approach I recommend.</p>
<p>However, again, I think most people do well</p>
<p>to figure out which specific ingredients</p>
<p>are going to work best for them</p>
<p>by isolating the variables</p>
<p>the way I&rsquo;ve described repeatedly throughout this episode.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, Tonga Ali does not need to be cycled,</p>
<p>meaning you don&rsquo;t have to take periods of time off from it.</p>
<p>I should note that the effects of Tonga Ali</p>
<p>can take a little bit longer to experience.</p>
<p>So perhaps blood work should be done eight to 12 weeks</p>
<p>after initiating the Tonga Ali protocol</p>
<p>as opposed to earlier.</p>
<p>And it does seem to have sort of cumulative effects</p>
<p>on libido.</p>
<p>And that points to the likelihood</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s having some impact on neural pathways</p>
<p>as opposed to hormone pathways.</p>
<p>Hormone pathways can be slow,</p>
<p>but in general neural pathways</p>
<p>are the ones that are going to explain slow rising shifts</p>
<p>in any kind of physical or mental aspect</p>
<p>that then remains stable over time.</p>
<p>So the exact effects of Tonga Ali,</p>
<p>meaning where they arise in the brain and body aren&rsquo;t known.</p>
<p>I will provide a link to a really beautiful review article</p>
<p>that covers the literature on Tonga Ali.</p>
<p>This came out fairly recently</p>
<p>and that I&rsquo;ve reviewed with a number of other</p>
<p>MDs and medical or medicine-related podcasters.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really nice review.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll provide a link to that.</p>
<p>Gives a survey of Tonga Ali,</p>
<p>what people are discovering, what they&rsquo;re finding,</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re not finding and so forth.</p>
<p>As a final note on supplements</p>
<p>for hormone augmentation and supplementation,</p>
<p>I want to make a brief mention</p>
<p>of something specifically related to female health,</p>
<p>which is of course the menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>And across the menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>different hormones are present at different levels.</p>
<p>Follicle stimulating hormone is very high</p>
<p>during the so-called follicular phase, right?</p>
<p>And then you have your luteal phase.</p>
<p>We have an entire episode coming up</p>
<p>about female hormones and hormone health</p>
<p>that will cover this.</p>
<p>We also have covered a little bit of this</p>
<p>in the other episodes on testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>But the point I&rsquo;d like to make now is that for women,</p>
<p>they should fully expect that certain supplements,</p>
<p>not all, but certain supplements,</p>
<p>because of the way they impact different hormones,</p>
<p>would have different effects,</p>
<p>maybe even opposite effects</p>
<p>at different phases of the menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>And for that reason,</p>
<p>I believe it is especially important</p>
<p>to have tight control over dosage</p>
<p>and individual ingredients in your supplement regimen.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you&rsquo;re somebody who takes Shilajit,</p>
<p>and I know many women who take Shilajit or Tonga Ali,</p>
<p>for instance, or Maca,</p>
<p>and you find that it really serves you well,</p>
<p>that is it provides the mental and physical benefits</p>
<p>that you want and enjoy</p>
<p>at certain phases of your menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>but at other phases of your menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>it feels like too much,</p>
<p>or it actually can start to give you negative</p>
<p>mental or physical effects,</p>
<p>well, then obviously having control</p>
<p>over those specific ingredients</p>
<p>is going to be extremely important</p>
<p>so that you can titrate the dosage</p>
<p>or increase the dosage as the case may be,</p>
<p>or cease taking those things entirely</p>
<p>at certain phases of your menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s not to say that some women</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t just continuously take these supplements</p>
<p>throughout their menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>Some can, but some find</p>
<p>that that makes them very uncomfortable</p>
<p>or that they would do well</p>
<p>to alter different ingredients</p>
<p>at different phases of their cycle.</p>
<p>So again, this speaks to the critical importance</p>
<p>of single ingredient control, dosage control,</p>
<p>and the ability to cease taking individual</p>
<p>or multiple ingredients</p>
<p>according to the backdrop of your health generally,</p>
<p>and obviously the menstrual cycle is a profound shift</p>
<p>in the hormones and thus the entire biological</p>
<p>and psychological milieu that exist in the body.</p>
<p>And of course, there&rsquo;s the issue of birth control</p>
<p>and whether or not people</p>
<p>are taking hormone-based birth control.</p>
<p>Certain forms of hormone-based birth control</p>
<p>in women involve tonically elevating,</p>
<p>that means consistently elevating estrogen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s certainly going to reduce the fluctuations</p>
<p>and thus the probability that certain hormones</p>
<p>and hormone pathways will change across the menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>but not eliminate it altogether.</p>
<p>Also, there&rsquo;s the key issue of fertility</p>
<p>in both males and females.</p>
<p>One important note,</p>
<p>even though this is not an episode about fertility,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to have one soon,</p>
<p>but the important point about fertility</p>
<p>is that there are supplements,</p>
<p>not just Shelogy,</p>
<p>but there are supplements and supplement protocols</p>
<p>such as L-carnitine, in particular injectable L-carnitine,</p>
<p>which does require a prescription, at least in the US,</p>
<p>but also orally ingested L-carnitine</p>
<p>that can improve sperm health and motility</p>
<p>and egg health and motility, I mentioned that earlier.</p>
<p>But if couples are trying to conceive,</p>
<p>it is important that if you&rsquo;re going to take something</p>
<p>that is a supplement directed towards sperm</p>
<p>and or egg health,</p>
<p>that you also consider how that interfaces</p>
<p>with some of the other hormone-based compounds,</p>
<p>that is prescription drugs that you may be taking.</p>
<p>This is true for people who are doing IVF</p>
<p>in vitro fertilization or not.</p>
<p>Again, that entire discussion will be handled</p>
<p>in our episode on fertility and on female hormone health.</p>
<p>And we already did the episode with Dr. Kyle Gillette</p>
<p>on male hormone health optimization.</p>
<p>The next category of supplementation</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d like to address</p>
<p>is supplements related to cognitive enhancement and focus.</p>
<p>And here there are a number of very useful strategies</p>
<p>that one could take.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to divide this conversation</p>
<p>into two general categories of supplements</p>
<p>to address cognitive enhancement and focus.</p>
<p>The first category are supplements that increase energy</p>
<p>by way of stimulant properties.</p>
<p>So the most obvious of these is caffeine.</p>
<p>Caffeine is of course,</p>
<p>a molecule that can increase levels of alertness.</p>
<p>It also can increase levels of focus</p>
<p>provided that dosages are in the appropriate range.</p>
<p>The appropriate range in most cases</p>
<p>is going to be one to three milligrams</p>
<p>per kilogram of body weight,</p>
<p>taken 30 minutes or so</p>
<p>before any kind of mental or physical endeavor.</p>
<p>We did an entire episode about caffeine</p>
<p>where you can learn lots of facts about caffeine,</p>
<p>how best to utilize caffeine.</p>
<p>And indeed, I&rsquo;ll just give you a few of those now.</p>
<p>It turns out that if you&rsquo;re a regular caffeine user,</p>
<p>you can still derive the cognitive enhancing</p>
<p>and focus enhancing effects of caffeine</p>
<p>if you ingest caffeine every day.</p>
<p>But if you were to take two days off</p>
<p>from caffeine completely,</p>
<p>and right now I hear all the caffeine addicts out there</p>
<p>just kind of cringing at the idea,</p>
<p>and then take caffeine in the 30 minutes</p>
<p>prior to some especially important event,</p>
<p>physical or mental event where you really need to focus</p>
<p>and be able to sustain that focus for long periods of time,</p>
<p>it would have an even greater effect than it normally would.</p>
<p>But since most people are taking caffeine</p>
<p>in a kind of ongoing regular way,</p>
<p>I just want to emphasize</p>
<p>that it still has pro-cognitive and pro-focus effects,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s taken every day</p>
<p>or even multiple times per day.</p>
<p>Again, a cautionary note,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t drink caffeine too late in the day.</p>
<p>Past 2 p.m. it can really start to impede</p>
<p>your sleep at night.</p>
<p>Even if you can fall asleep at night,</p>
<p>the architecture of that sleep is not going to be great</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re ingesting caffeine</p>
<p>in the preceding eight to 10 and even 12 hours.</p>
<p>And that actually raises another tangential</p>
<p>but still important point.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to make it and then get back to supplements,</p>
<p>which is the best cognitive enhancer</p>
<p>that you will ever take is a really good night&rsquo;s sleep</p>
<p>of sufficient duration, okay?</p>
<p>So sleep is going to be the bedrock</p>
<p>of your ability to focus and remember things.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s during sleep that neural connections remodel,</p>
<p>so-called neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually not when you trigger learning,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s when you consolidate and reinforce learning</p>
<p>and a number of other things</p>
<p>that relate to cognitive enhancement and focus.</p>
<p>The other thing, of course,</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re going to need</p>
<p>to have sufficient levels of nutrition.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t want to be overly hungry</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s going to be hard to focus,</p>
<p>nor do you want to be overloaded with calories</p>
<p>or a volume of food or have your blood glucose to be so high</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s going to make you sleepy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason why when discussing stress</p>
<p>and the so-called autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>that the phrase rest and digest comes into play.</p>
<p>Rest and digest, as the name implies,</p>
<p>relates to the fact that when we have</p>
<p>a lot of food in our gut, it tends to make us sleepy.</p>
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s hard for us to focus</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hard for us to maintain cognitive attention</p>
<p>and remember things, et cetera.</p>
<p>So there are a bunch of behavioral tools</p>
<p>for enhancing focus.</p>
<p>We did an entire episode on enhancing focus.</p>
<p>It does touch on supplementation.</p>
<p>Again, you can find links to that</p>
<p>in all formats at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>We also have a newsletter related to this topic,</p>
<p>also at hubermanlab.com at zero cost.</p>
<p>With all of that said, and in particular,</p>
<p>the highlight about sleep being the best way</p>
<p>to enhance your cognitive abilities and focus,</p>
<p>anytime we&rsquo;re having a discussion about supplements</p>
<p>for enhancing cognitive ability and focus,</p>
<p>a major category of those supplements</p>
<p>is going to fall into the stimulant category.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to include most often caffeine,</p>
<p>although there are other sources of stimulants.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to touch on those for the moment.</p>
<p>Just talk about caffeine.</p>
<p>When people hear caffeine, they think,</p>
<p>oh, well, I can just drink coffee.</p>
<p>And indeed, that&rsquo;s a great source of caffeine.</p>
<p>So is yerba mate.</p>
<p>I would caution people to,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to use yerba mate for whatever purpose,</p>
<p>caffeine or otherwise,</p>
<p>that you avoid the smoked versions of yerba mate.</p>
<p>They are carcinogenic.</p>
<p>That is the smoked versions are carcinogenic.</p>
<p>And to consume the non-smoked varieties instead.</p>
<p>The important thing to understand about caffeine</p>
<p>is that while it can be ingested in the form of a drink</p>
<p>or an energy drink, tea or coffee,</p>
<p>it can also be ingested as a pure supplement.</p>
<p>That is, there are caffeine supplements.</p>
<p>And I know a number of people,</p>
<p>including a very, very prominent podcaster,</p>
<p>whose name I won&rsquo;t mention,</p>
<p>who drinks herbal tea,</p>
<p>but takes a 100 to 300 milligram tablet of caffeine</p>
<p>with the herbal tea.</p>
<p>So in that case, it is no longer herbal tea.</p>
<p>It is caffeinated herbal tea.</p>
<p>When you take caffeine in pill form,</p>
<p>it tends to have a much more potent and long lasting effect</p>
<p>than when you take caffeine in the form of coffee or tea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a world apart in terms of its effects.</p>
<p>And if you haven&rsquo;t experienced this before,</p>
<p>it might be something that you want to explore.</p>
<p>It might not be something you want to explore.</p>
<p>In particular, if you&rsquo;re somebody who experiences anxiety</p>
<p>or panic attacks,</p>
<p>be very careful with your intake of caffeine.</p>
<p>Again, see the episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>all about caffeine for more on that.</p>
<p>But it is the case that even 100 milligrams of caffeine</p>
<p>in tablet form,</p>
<p>I suppose it could be in capsule form as well,</p>
<p>but in its pure form,</p>
<p>leads to much greater enhancement of alertness and focus</p>
<p>than does often the comparable amount</p>
<p>or even twice the amount of caffeine</p>
<p>contained in coffee or tea.</p>
<p>Now, why would that be?</p>
<p>Has a lot to do with the other things</p>
<p>that are in coffee and tea.</p>
<p>So here I&rsquo;m not encouraging people to become reliant</p>
<p>on caffeine capsules or on caffeine tablets,</p>
<p>but if you want to increase alertness and focus,</p>
<p>caffeine is a potent way to do that.</p>
<p>It works.</p>
<p>The other category of stimulant that can work</p>
<p>in terms of enhancing alertness and focus</p>
<p>are going to be things that increase adrenaline</p>
<p>in some other way or epinephrine,</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s also called adrenaline, epinephrine, same thing,</p>
<p>in some other way that are going to touch into</p>
<p>or augment the so-called adrenergic and adrenaline systems.</p>
<p>And there are things like johimbine</p>
<p>and different forms of johimbine, like alpha johimbine.</p>
<p>There are multiple forms of these things.</p>
<p>Now, I would go to examine.com</p>
<p>to explore the different forms of johimbine.</p>
<p>About 10, 20 years ago,</p>
<p>johimbine was marketed primarily as a pro-libido</p>
<p>and pro-erectile agent.</p>
<p>Turns out it has very low efficacy for both of those things,</p>
<p>but there are certain forms of johimbine</p>
<p>that act as stimulants that are effective</p>
<p>and are separate from those claims and pathways.</p>
<p>One particular form is called alpha johimbine.</p>
<p>It sometimes goes by the name Rawulsine,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s spelled R-A-U-W-O-L-S-C-I-N-E.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s alpha johimbine,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s used as a stimulant often</p>
<p>to also promote fat loss and alertness.</p>
<p>I have to say that it&rsquo;s a very potent</p>
<p>and somewhat precarious supplement.</p>
<p>Some people experience a lot of anxiety on it.</p>
<p>That could also be because they tend to take it</p>
<p>on either an empty stomach</p>
<p>or in combination with subcaloric diets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of getting out on the edge of things</p>
<p>that for some people can work not so well.</p>
<p>For other people, they might actually find it</p>
<p>to be a very effective stimulant.</p>
<p>In general, in terms of supplement-based approaches</p>
<p>to increase cognitive function and focus,</p>
<p>caffeine either in coffee or tea form</p>
<p>or in tablet or capsule form,</p>
<p>but at lower dosages than you would find in coffee and tea,</p>
<p>I think is actually a reasonable way</p>
<p>to explore stimulant-based approaches</p>
<p>for enhancing cognitive function and focus.</p>
<p>I mention all that not because I think</p>
<p>that you probably already didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that caffeine can enhance alertness and focus.</p>
<p>Most people already know that, and I acknowledge that,</p>
<p>but rather as a contrast point</p>
<p>for the other supplement-based approach</p>
<p>for increasing cognitive function and focus,</p>
<p>which is to increase certain neurotransmitter pathways</p>
<p>that are not stimulant-based.</p>
<p>So for instance, alpha-GPC,</p>
<p>which is essentially a choline donor,</p>
<p>acts in the pathways related</p>
<p>to the neuromodulator acetylcholine and can enhance focus.</p>
<p>So at dosages of anywhere from 300 to 600 milligrams,</p>
<p>people experience heightened levels of focus</p>
<p>for sake of mental work or physical work.</p>
<p>The half-life of alpha-GPC is about four to six hours,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s relatively short-lasting,</p>
<p>although you wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily want</p>
<p>to take it right before bed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recommend that.</p>
<p>It is not a stimulant.</p>
<p>It tends to enhance focus by augmenting acetylcholine</p>
<p>and acetylcholine pathways specifically.</p>
<p>Now, it does create a little bit</p>
<p>of an increase in alertness.</p>
<p>So some people actually perceive it subjectively</p>
<p>as an increase in overall stimulation,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s different than a caffeine-type stimulant.</p>
<p>So for instance, 300 milligrams to 600 milligrams</p>
<p>of alpha-GPC taken alone will allow people</p>
<p>to be more focused, but doesn&rsquo;t tend</p>
<p>to make people feel jittery or overstimulated.</p>
<p>Similarly, 500 milligrams to 1,000 milligrams,</p>
<p>or somewhere in between, of something like L-tyrosine,</p>
<p>which is an amino acid precursor to dopamine,</p>
<p>a different neuromodulator, taken alone</p>
<p>or in conjunction with, again,</p>
<p>I believe in separating these things out by product,</p>
<p>but I suppose you could take alpha-GPC</p>
<p>and L-tyrosine together if you had already tried</p>
<p>them separately and decided they worked well for you.</p>
<p>And then you decide to combine them.</p>
<p>What people tend to experience is</p>
<p>that the cholinergic stimulation from alpha-GPC</p>
<p>and the dopaminergic stimulation from L-tyrosine</p>
<p>or simply L-tyrosine alone or alpha-GPC alone</p>
<p>leads to increased levels of focus</p>
<p>without the kind of overall feelings</p>
<p>of stimulant-based alertness</p>
<p>that one would experience with caffeine.</p>
<p>Or I should say, of course, there are products out there</p>
<p>and there are people out there</p>
<p>that combine all three of these things together,</p>
<p>caffeine, alpha-GPC, and L-tyrosine.</p>
<p>And while I&rsquo;m not suggesting that&rsquo;s a good or a bad thing,</p>
<p>I would suggest that anytime you start</p>
<p>to explore the cognitive enhancing effects</p>
<p>and the focus enhancing effects of any supplement</p>
<p>that you ask which ones are stimulants,</p>
<p>so for instance, caffeine and alpha-uhimbine,</p>
<p>which ones tend to tap more into neuromodulator systems</p>
<p>like alpha-GPC and L-tyrosine,</p>
<p>and to separate those out conceptually,</p>
<p>because whereas things like alpha-uhimbine and caffeine</p>
<p>will mostly serve the role of increasing levels</p>
<p>of alertness but not tightening your focus,</p>
<p>things like alpha-GPC and L-tyrosine</p>
<p>tend to serve the role of less elevation and alertness</p>
<p>but more tightening of focus.</p>
<p>And this, of course, is why people often stack these</p>
<p>and take them in combination.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s a very important distinction</p>
<p>that most people aren&rsquo;t aware of.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not here to tell you</p>
<p>that the stimulant-based approach</p>
<p>or the neuromodulator-based approach is better or worse.</p>
<p>They are simply different from one another.</p>
<p>Although I will say that I think it is important</p>
<p>to explore them separately</p>
<p>if indeed you&rsquo;re going to explore any of them</p>
<p>before you would start to combine them in a single formula.</p>
<p>Again, individual ingredients are going to be the way to go</p>
<p>in terms of figuring out what&rsquo;s best for you.</p>
<p>If anything, some people may find</p>
<p>that even the slightest bit of caffeine</p>
<p>or even the slightest bit of alpha-GPC or L-tyrosine</p>
<p>just places them into a state of mind and or body</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just uncomfortable and not compatible</p>
<p>with the kind of work that they want to do.</p>
<p>Whereas other people, such as myself,</p>
<p>regularly rely on taking 300 milligrams of alpha-GPC.</p>
<p>It turns out more than that kind of doesn&rsquo;t work for me</p>
<p>or it tends to send my mind down a pathway</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t like to be in for sake of cognitive work,</p>
<p>but I will routinely take 300 milligrams of alpha-GPC</p>
<p>prior to some cognitive work or prior to a workout.</p>
<p>I do often combine that with some caffeine,</p>
<p>not in capsule or pill form,</p>
<p>but rather in the form of a cup of coffee or your bermatae.</p>
<p>And it turns out that for me, just by way of example,</p>
<p>L-tyrosine is something that works very powerfully</p>
<p>to elevate my level of focus,</p>
<p>but that I tend to crash pretty hard afterward.</p>
<p>And so I tend to err away from L-tyrosine,</p>
<p>but some people tolerate it really well</p>
<p>and actually really like it.</p>
<p>I rely on something else for dopamine augmentation,</p>
<p>which is phenolethylamine,</p>
<p>which is a little bit more short lasting.</p>
<p>Again, I arrived at these protocols for myself</p>
<p>by mixing and matching,</p>
<p>but mostly by trying individual ingredients alone</p>
<p>before combining them into any sort of cocktail</p>
<p>before taking them before a workout</p>
<p>or before a cognitive work bout.</p>
<p>And I suggest that you explore them in the same way</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s going to deliver you</p>
<p>to the best possible protocols for you,</p>
<p>which only you can determine.</p>
<p>And then of course, there&rsquo;s the category of supplements</p>
<p>that can support cognitive function and focus,</p>
<p>but that also touch on other general functions</p>
<p>related to brain and body health,</p>
<p>such as metabolic health, mood, et cetera.</p>
<p>And the one that comes to mind here</p>
<p>are the omega-3 fatty acids.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked a lot about omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>that are available in the form of foods.</p>
<p>So for instance, fatty ocean fish,</p>
<p>and there are certain plant-based sources</p>
<p>for these as well, certain algaes and things of that sort.</p>
<p>Touched on this in the episodes on depression</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>But this topic mainly comes up around the issue of fish oil,</p>
<p>fish oil capsules and liquid.</p>
<p>And this is a discussion I think is worth having.</p>
<p>Early on in the episode,</p>
<p>we talked about foundational nutrition</p>
<p>and supplements that include a bunch</p>
<p>of different ingredients.</p>
<p>We touched on the idea that some people</p>
<p>might have the budget to take one such product</p>
<p>or any number of different products</p>
<p>that combine all those ingredients.</p>
<p>I should say that for those that are interested</p>
<p>in taking a supplement, but have a lower budget</p>
<p>than would allow for taking one of those general categories</p>
<p>of supplements we talked about earlier</p>
<p>for foundational nutrition that combines everything,</p>
<p>vitamins, minerals, probiotics, prebiotics,</p>
<p>adaptogens, digestive enzymes.</p>
<p>I do think that there&rsquo;s a category of supplements</p>
<p>that can greatly enhance the probability</p>
<p>of offsetting depression and maybe even improve mood</p>
<p>directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s evidence for what I&rsquo;m about to tell you</p>
<p>within the scientific literature</p>
<p>and or offset the amount of antidepressant medication</p>
<p>that people need to take.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also been demonstrated</p>
<p>and improve metabolic function, cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>and also enhance our ability to do focused work.</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m referring to the so-called</p>
<p>omega-3 essential fatty acids,</p>
<p>in particular the omega-3 form of the essential fatty acids.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s now a lot of data showing that ingesting</p>
<p>one to three grams of EPA in particular</p>
<p>in the form of either fish oil capsules or liquid</p>
<p>can be beneficial for a number of different aspects</p>
<p>of brain and body health</p>
<p>and can enhance focus and cognitive ability.</p>
<p>This is especially true in developing brains.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s actually an extensive data out of a laboratory</p>
<p>at University of California, Santa Barbara,</p>
<p>talking about how mothers who supplement omega-3s</p>
<p>in particular the EPAs,</p>
<p>although they also need to get the DHAs,</p>
<p>that leads to greater brain weights and health of offspring.</p>
<p>This is something we will definitely explore</p>
<p>in a future episode, likely with an expert guest</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s doing that work in that laboratory</p>
<p>at UC Santa Barbara.</p>
<p>The point here is that if somebody has a limited budget</p>
<p>to purchase supplements</p>
<p>and cannot afford a foundational supplement</p>
<p>in the sort that we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>athletic greens are similar,</p>
<p>but they do have a budget that would allow them</p>
<p>to purchase a high quality omega-3 fatty acid fish oil</p>
<p>and to ingest it in quantities sufficient enough</p>
<p>to get above that one gram of EPA per day.</p>
<p>Again, this is really important.</p>
<p>If you look at the product labels,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll often see 1,500 or 1,600 milligrams</p>
<p>of essential fatty acids.</p>
<p>But the key is you get above that one gram of EPA</p>
<p>per day threshold and as high as three grams per day.</p>
<p>We had a guest on this podcast, Dr. Rhonda Patrick,</p>
<p>who takes anywhere from I believe three to four,</p>
<p>maybe even more grams of EPA per day</p>
<p>for a variety of reasons,</p>
<p>including some of the reasons we&rsquo;re discussing now.</p>
<p>Before we move on to discussing</p>
<p>some of the more global themes related</p>
<p>to developing a rational supplementation protocol,</p>
<p>I do want to touch on this vast category of supplementation</p>
<p>that includes food-based or food mimic type supplements.</p>
<p>So this would be, for instance, whey proteins,</p>
<p>or milk proteins, or egg proteins, or plant proteins.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a discussion that in and of itself</p>
<p>deserves an entire episode.</p>
<p>If you want to understand which types of protein</p>
<p>and source of proteins are going to be the most bioavailable,</p>
<p>the best for protein synthesis,</p>
<p>for recovery from exercise, building muscle, et cetera,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to refer you to a segment within the episode</p>
<p>that I did with Dr. Lane Norton,</p>
<p>where he talks about total protein needs per day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about one gram per pound of body weight per day</p>
<p>for most people, although there&rsquo;s some variation</p>
<p>depending on activity, et cetera.</p>
<p>And the quality of sourcing of those various proteins</p>
<p>is extremely important.</p>
<p>And that of course leads to a discussion</p>
<p>about the quality and type of protein</p>
<p>that would be present in a supplement,</p>
<p>like a whey protein supplement or casein,</p>
<p>which is a milk protein-based supplement.</p>
<p>That discussion is segmented and timestamped</p>
<p>in the episode that I did with him.</p>
<p>You can find it hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>He actually pointed to some interesting data</p>
<p>on potato protein as perhaps being</p>
<p>a great plant-based substitute</p>
<p>for those that don&rsquo;t want to take whey-based protein,</p>
<p>but the fact that whey-based proteins can be very useful</p>
<p>for getting to and above a protein threshold</p>
<p>for all sorts of reasons, not just for muscle building,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s great for that,</p>
<p>but for other purposes as well.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s but one category of food-based</p>
<p>or food-mimic type supplements.</p>
<p>There are, for instance, branched-chain amino acids.</p>
<p>There are, for instance, green tea supplements.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge landscape of this,</p>
<p>far too much for us to get into</p>
<p>in any kind of reasonable detail,</p>
<p>but I do want to acknowledge that those all exist.</p>
<p>The key thing to understand is that</p>
<p>while they can serve a great role</p>
<p>in providing replacement for meals</p>
<p>that you perhaps couldn&rsquo;t have consumed otherwise,</p>
<p>and while they often are very convenient</p>
<p>because you can drink as opposed to eat your calories,</p>
<p>I think that most people would agree</p>
<p>that getting some significant fraction of your nutrition</p>
<p>from whole foods is going to be useful</p>
<p>for a variety of reasons,</p>
<p>in particular, the fiber that comes along with it,</p>
<p>the bulk of the food that tends to make us feel sated,</p>
<p>and of course, the fact that a lot of vitamins and minerals</p>
<p>and other things that are contained within foods,</p>
<p>as well as essential fatty acids</p>
<p>in foods like animal-based proteins</p>
<p>are not going to be present in most,</p>
<p>if not all of those kind of food mimic type powders</p>
<p>and replacements for food.</p>
<p>Another point is this question about age-related effects.</p>
<p>So for instance, should kids be taking supplements?</p>
<p>Well, I mentioned earlier that there&rsquo;s some evidence</p>
<p>that making sure that kids are getting enough</p>
<p>omega-3 fatty acids can be beneficial.</p>
<p>They certainly could get those from food-based sources.</p>
<p>Just look up online food-based sources</p>
<p>of omega-3 fatty acids and EPAs,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll see lists there.</p>
<p>Some people choose to supplement on top of that.</p>
<p>In particular, in kids that are developing very quickly,</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re consuming enough EPAs from food,</p>
<p>some parents choose to supplement on top of that.</p>
<p>I am personally not a fan of children taking melatonin</p>
<p>for the reason that melatonin</p>
<p>is already chronically elevated in kids,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a growing body of literature</p>
<p>that melatonin supplementation in kids</p>
<p>can be potentially harmful.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to create alarm</p>
<p>among those who have already been taking it</p>
<p>or giving it to their kids</p>
<p>or that gave it to their kids in the past,</p>
<p>but I do think that melatonin in particular</p>
<p>should be approached with a lot of caution,</p>
<p>especially for kids.</p>
<p>And then of course, there&rsquo;s the issue</p>
<p>of whether or not all these other supplements</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve discussed, whether or not kids</p>
<p>can take them safely.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s highly individual.</p>
<p>I would say that for the supplements</p>
<p>that relate to hormone augmentation and support,</p>
<p>unless your physician, a board-certified MD,</p>
<p>specifically recommends them,</p>
<p>I would strongly suggest avoiding intake of those things</p>
<p>until at least after puberty</p>
<p>and probably into the late teens and early 20s,</p>
<p>because the body and brain are still developing</p>
<p>and hormone systems are still active.</p>
<p>Even though puberty may happen between ages 11 and 14</p>
<p>or even 15, puberty can be a long lasting event</p>
<p>with a long taper and tail on it.</p>
<p>So you want to be cautious about augmenting hormones</p>
<p>in young people through the use of supplementation,</p>
<p>unless a physician is working very closely with you</p>
<p>or rather you with them.</p>
<p>And then in ages of say 22 years old, 24 and older,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any reason why people who are in their 50s</p>
<p>or 60s would have any different protocols</p>
<p>than people in their 30s and 40s,</p>
<p>except perhaps in the domain of cognitive enhancement</p>
<p>where it might make sense.</p>
<p>Again, might, provided it can be done safely</p>
<p>and with the consult of a physician.</p>
<p>It might be beneficial for people</p>
<p>who are approaching their later years</p>
<p>to consider increasing dosages or the variety of things</p>
<p>and approaches that they take for cognitive enhancement,</p>
<p>because age-related cognitive decline is a reality.</p>
<p>There is no person that escapes that.</p>
<p>The question is whether or not the slope of that decline</p>
<p>is very steep or very shallow.</p>
<p>And of course, this is an opportunity for me to raise</p>
<p>the point that I made much earlier</p>
<p>and that I&rsquo;ll make over and over again,</p>
<p>because it really is the most important point</p>
<p>to today&rsquo;s discussion, which is that behaviors</p>
<p>both exercise, sleep,</p>
<p>making sure that your relationship to light,</p>
<p>getting sufficient sunlight early in the day</p>
<p>and throughout the day if you can,</p>
<p>and limiting your viewing of bright artificial light</p>
<p>in the late evening,</p>
<p>and especially between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.,</p>
<p>things of that sort, all the do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts.</p>
<p>And of course, cardiovascular exercise</p>
<p>and resistance training exercise,</p>
<p>and maybe even flexibility training exercise,</p>
<p>topics we&rsquo;ve covered extensively on this podcast</p>
<p>and for which we will soon have a special series</p>
<p>airing with Dr. Andy Galpin that gets into a lot of detail</p>
<p>and protocol development that you can all employ.</p>
<p>All of that needs to be done at every age,</p>
<p>certainly past puberty,</p>
<p>in order to maximize cognitive function,</p>
<p>in order to maximize cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>in order to maximize focus,</p>
<p>and every aspect that we really all stand to</p>
<p>and want to enhance when we think about supplementation.</p>
<p>So again, get your sleep right,</p>
<p>do that by getting your relationship to light right,</p>
<p>get your exercise right,</p>
<p>quality social connection right,</p>
<p>and then of course there&rsquo;s that landscape of nutrition</p>
<p>that we talked about extensively earlier</p>
<p>and for which we have other episodes that really dive deep,</p>
<p>including that episode, or I should say,</p>
<p>in particular that episode with Dr. Lane Norton,</p>
<p>where we really took a full survey</p>
<p>of the landscape of nutrition,</p>
<p>everything from protein needs, vitamins, minerals, fiber,</p>
<p>microbiome, it&rsquo;s a deep, deep discussion</p>
<p>with a lot of actionable takeaways.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re curious about nutrition,</p>
<p>and in particular if you&rsquo;re a vegan or vegetarian</p>
<p>or carnivore based,</p>
<p>but even for the more common omnivores, such as myself,</p>
<p>I found that to be an incredible learning journey</p>
<p>thanks to Dr. Lane Norton,</p>
<p>just so much useful knowledge in that episode,</p>
<p>if you want to learn more about nutrition.</p>
<p>The behavioral tools, the nutritional tools</p>
<p>are really going to serve as the primary two layers</p>
<p>upon which your supplementation protocols are going to rest.</p>
<p>And again, I want to emphasize</p>
<p>that your supplementation protocol may be zero supplements.</p>
<p>It could include no supplements whatsoever,</p>
<p>and that would be perfectly fine</p>
<p>provided that you&rsquo;re sleeping as well as you want to</p>
<p>and need to, you&rsquo;re able to focus and work</p>
<p>as well as you want to and need to,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re able to perform physically</p>
<p>as well as you want to and need to,</p>
<p>and you feel that your hormones and related functions</p>
<p>are where you want them.</p>
<p>However, for most people</p>
<p>who are doing most everything right,</p>
<p>they want to explore how they can make things</p>
<p>like their sleep, their focus,</p>
<p>their hormone function even better.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where supplementation makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>And when I say it makes a lot of sense,</p>
<p>I mean, it makes a lot of sense to explore</p>
<p>in a rational and regimented way.</p>
<p>There are a couple of big themes</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve talked about a few times during today&rsquo;s podcast</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d like to reiterate now</p>
<p>because they are so crucial</p>
<p>to developing a rational supplementation protocol.</p>
<p>The most important of which is,</p>
<p>unless we&rsquo;re talking about foundational nutritional support,</p>
<p>that is coverage of vitamins, minerals,</p>
<p>digestive enzymes, probiotics, prebiotics, and adaptogens,</p>
<p>we should really be focusing</p>
<p>on single ingredient formulations.</p>
<p>Foundational supplements</p>
<p>that include all those things I just listed off,</p>
<p>all combined in one supplement are fine.</p>
<p>I simply don&rsquo;t see any other practical or reasonable way</p>
<p>to get each and every one of those things</p>
<p>through single ingredient formulations.</p>
<p>However, when you want to start thinking about</p>
<p>and actually practically exploring</p>
<p>things like supplementation for sleep or hormone health</p>
<p>or cognitive function,</p>
<p>the single ingredient formulations</p>
<p>are going to give you the most power and control.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to make sure</p>
<p>that you can find the minimal effective doses,</p>
<p>that you can rule out things that are not effective for you</p>
<p>or that may be detrimental for you in whatever fashion.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just about cost-effectiveness,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also about arriving at small kits</p>
<p>or cocktails of supplements</p>
<p>that you can really manage and work with</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not dependent on,</p>
<p>but that you really feel can augment</p>
<p>the various aspects of your health</p>
<p>that are important to you.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really what today&rsquo;s episode is about.</p>
<p>Even though we had coverage of specific supplements</p>
<p>and their functions in these different domains</p>
<p>of mental and physical health and performance,</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s episode was really geared</p>
<p>toward giving you resources and a framework</p>
<p>to think about how to approach supplementation,</p>
<p>how to navigate sticking points</p>
<p>and pain points in supplementation,</p>
<p>how to get the most out of your supplementation regimen</p>
<p>without spending an excessive amount of money</p>
<p>and if you don&rsquo;t have finances</p>
<p>to allow for a lot of exploration of supplements,</p>
<p>how to narrow in on the most effective supplements</p>
<p>the most quickly and derive all the benefits</p>
<p>that you can from them.</p>
<p>And as a final point that is redundant</p>
<p>with a few of the themes we talked about today,</p>
<p>but that I don&rsquo;t think I ever really explicitly stated</p>
<p>is that while the word supplement makes it sound like</p>
<p>these compounds are something just to add on top of</p>
<p>or compensate for deficiencies in nutrition</p>
<p>or other areas of your life,</p>
<p>many of them are actually quite potent compounds.</p>
<p>These are potent non-prescription molecules</p>
<p>that really can move the needle</p>
<p>in terms of your ability to think more clearly,</p>
<p>sleep better, support your hormone function.</p>
<p>But as always, they are just one element</p>
<p>within an ecosystem of other factors,</p>
<p>such as your behaviors, which includes do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts,</p>
<p>such as your nutrition,</p>
<p>maybe even such as prescription drugs</p>
<p>that you also might happen to be taking</p>
<p>or hoping to be taking less of or removing completely.</p>
<p>Again, that has to be done in discussion with physicians</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to do it at all.</p>
<p>But the real point here is that what we call supplements</p>
<p>are actually a powerful gear within a larger system</p>
<p>aimed at each and every one of us customizing tools</p>
<p>for our mental, physical health and performance.</p>
