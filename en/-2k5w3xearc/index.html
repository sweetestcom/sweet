<p>welcome back everyone I&rsquo;m back I was</p>
<p>gone for a couple weeks uh anything that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say is definitely not meant to</p>
<p>diagnose or replace your medical care</p>
<p>check with your doctor before</p>
<p>implementing any of the things we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to talk about there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>things we&rsquo;re going to talk about so hey</p>
<p>Steve hey good morning what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>Welcome Back we&rsquo;ve all missed you Dr</p>
<p>Berg and are very excited to find out</p>
<p>what sort of research you did in the</p>
<p>field or I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re in Vegas</p>
<p>for a couple of weeks whatever but we&rsquo;d</p>
<p>love to hear from you to see what your</p>
<p>progress was and if you discovered</p>
<p>anything new for us to ingest so if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t mind Dr Burke take it away and</p>
<p>catch us up on the last three weeks or</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>yeah the food in Vegas was great uh and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being very sarcastic at the</p>
<p>all-you-can-eat buffet now it&rsquo;s uh I</p>
<p>went to um Europe because I wanted to</p>
<p>find out</p>
<p>um you know you go to Europe and</p>
<p>if you compare Europe to America as far</p>
<p>as the foods go there&rsquo;s a slight</p>
<p>difference right people go there and</p>
<p>they from America and they&rsquo;re like wow I</p>
<p>have I don&rsquo;t have digestive issues I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not gaining weight</p>
<p>um food&rsquo;s definitely higher quality for</p>
<p>sure so I wanted to find out why so I</p>
<p>visited we visited probably about 20</p>
<p>farms and went through and</p>
<p>learned so much and it was fascinating</p>
<p>because it really the the quality of</p>
<p>food comes from the soil and the quality</p>
<p>of soil and unfortunately um</p>
<p>you know we don&rsquo;t emphasize that enough</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m going to be doing a whole</p>
<p>presentation on that coming up soon so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll share what I found but</p>
<p>fascinating amazing stuff with the</p>
<p>farming techniques and how they make</p>
<p>their soil so fertile and how they grow</p>
<p>certain things so</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s very very exciting and I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>extremely interested in it because you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t your health comes from you know</p>
<p>healthy animals that graze on healthy</p>
<p>plants that come from healthy soils so</p>
<p>you gotta really talk about the soil</p>
<p>learn about that to really get you</p>
<p>healthy I mean I don&rsquo;t think this is</p>
<p>just my theory that you can eat</p>
<p>sick plants empty plants sick animals</p>
<p>and get healthy I think I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>you can I might be wrong but I think the</p>
<p>healthier the animal the plant the</p>
<p>healthier you&rsquo;re going to be just my</p>
<p>theory well it certainly holds water and</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>on the other hand Hostess Twinkies last</p>
<p>for a thousand years so maybe there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some trade-off there</p>
<p>yeah it definitely will preserve you</p>
<p>like an embalming agent but other than</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t know if it gets you healthy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great well we can&rsquo;t hear wait to</p>
<p>see all the videos and so on that come</p>
<p>out as a result of that and I tell you</p>
<p>what we have some uh great folks online</p>
<p>but one is coming to us from a recent</p>
<p>move to the Philippines and it&rsquo;s late at</p>
<p>night so we are going to go ahead with</p>
<p>Mr McKay from the Philippines and Mr</p>
<p>McKay you&rsquo;re wrong with Dr Berg</p>
<p>oh unmute yourself sir</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get my mic on unmuted</p>
<p>there there you go um hey Dr bird</p>
<p>um awesome that I get a chance to talk</p>
<p>to you I want to make this question</p>
<p>quick so I know everybody wants to ask</p>
<p>you questions but</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;ve actually done a 60-day</p>
<p>um juice fast before so I&rsquo;m kind of</p>
<p>um extreme on losing weight different</p>
<p>ways and I was looking at people that</p>
<p>have talked about doing boiled eggs and</p>
<p>just doing a boiled egg diet</p>
<p>um and doing it for a couple of weeks I</p>
<p>was thinking about doing it for a month</p>
<p>just to see if I could lose</p>
<p>um x amount of pounds and I wanted to</p>
<p>see your opinion about it if I wanted to</p>
<p>do intermittent fasting and just eat</p>
<p>boiled eggs for a month</p>
<p>um I know that uh Europe pretty adamant</p>
<p>on eating eggs I think that you talk</p>
<p>about not as much oil in them probably</p>
<p>eating them over easy so the yolks</p>
<p>um from what I remember from your videos</p>
<p>that there would be more nutritious but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just curious what would you say if I</p>
<p>was to do a 30-day</p>
<p>um egg diet where I just did</p>
<p>intermittent and I chose to eat once a</p>
<p>day and I chose to eat boiled eggs or</p>
<p>eggs over easy and nothing else for a</p>
<p>quick weight loss</p>
<p>um what would you think about that</p>
<p>is that a scary I think out of all the</p>
<p>things out of all the things you could</p>
<p>eat that probably would be the best</p>
<p>thing to eat if you were going to do</p>
<p>that for sure because it the egg has so</p>
<p>many nutrients especially if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get some eggs from a farm that you</p>
<p>know you know allowed them to free range</p>
<p>and or if you did get them from the</p>
<p>store they have to be pasteurized and</p>
<p>organic I think I think that would be um</p>
<p>I think that we would be successful you</p>
<p>may want to um also in addition to that</p>
<p>take certain things like for example uh</p>
<p>a natural vitamin C not ascorbic acid</p>
<p>but a natural vitamin C maybe some more</p>
<p>omega-3 fatty acids just to make sure</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not deficient in anything because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be getting the protein</p>
<p>which is EXO the best source of protein</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s good so you&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>get any atrophy maybe some trace</p>
<p>minerals and maybe</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;re probably going to need Vitamin</p>
<p>D but I think that might might be</p>
<p>successful just watch for any type of</p>
<p>problems you run into like um deficiency</p>
<p>problems because that&rsquo;s a long time to</p>
<p>fast which I I think it&rsquo;s great and the</p>
<p>the benefits are going to be off the</p>
<p>chart but let&rsquo;s say for example you do</p>
<p>this and you feel weaker or you have</p>
<p>some other symptoms like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you know just make sure you&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>all the other nutrients to prevent that</p>
<p>but you know it&rsquo;s not a bad idea and I</p>
<p>think</p>
<p>out of all the foods that would be</p>
<p>probably more the complete nutrient</p>
<p>profile foods that you could eat</p>
<p>okay yeah yeah I just wanted to get your</p>
<p>opinion on that well that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>yeah and over over easy over easy see</p>
<p>the egg yolk right if the egg yolk is</p>
<p>runny it&rsquo;s raw what you want to do now</p>
<p>you might say well doesn&rsquo;t there isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>there bacteria in there no because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way bacteria could penetrate</p>
<p>the shell and the white part to get to</p>
<p>the yellow part it&rsquo;s not going to happen</p>
<p>so um the only thing</p>
<p>um if you as long as you cook the white</p>
<p>part you know you&rsquo;re good and then keep</p>
<p>the inside fairly runny and then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you got a great product there so uh try</p>
<p>it out and let us know how how you do</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>I like the concept</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s great well we really would</p>
<p>love to it&rsquo;s about 40 pounds</p>
<p>good what a great goal so yeah let&rsquo;s do</p>
<p>that for sure come back on the air with</p>
<p>us in 30 days or whatever Mr McCain and</p>
<p>let us know how it went I imagine that</p>
<p>he being in the Philippines could</p>
<p>probably find some pretty uh good</p>
<p>sources for eggs and so on and why don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>we kick off your month Hiatus with the</p>
<p>first quiz question today and here it is</p>
<p>all right so what is um the most common</p>
<p>nutrient deficiency that keeps you tired</p>
<p>keeps you exhausted keeps you</p>
<p>um without energy that&rsquo;s the first</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s see how many of you guys know</p>
<p>that answer</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s right that&rsquo;s the first</p>
<p>question very good how about our first</p>
<p>question from YouTube uh this is Joy</p>
<p>wants to know what causes pain or</p>
<p>tingling under the left rib cage</p>
<p>interesting</p>
<p>um I have no idea other than maybe a</p>
<p>possible version of um</p>
<p>shingles possibly</p>
<p>um because that&rsquo;s the these those nerve</p>
<p>uh run right through the ribs through</p>
<p>there that could be uh maybe about mild</p>
<p>version on that I mean that&rsquo;s a long</p>
<p>shot but I mean I was I thought you were</p>
<p>going to stand underneath your feet but</p>
<p>underneath the rib cage</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>now if it&rsquo;s if there&rsquo;s something going</p>
<p>on deeper you know you think gallbladder</p>
<p>I think pancreas</p>
<p>you know pancreas and that usually</p>
<p>happens from the wrong type of foods</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re eating but typically</p>
<p>um if it&rsquo;s superficial it sounds more</p>
<p>like a um potential shingles type</p>
<p>outbreak and I have a lot of videos on</p>
<p>what to do about that vitamin D very</p>
<p>very important</p>
<p>very good well hope that&rsquo;s the extent of</p>
<p>it shingles is a bad deal for for many</p>
<p>okay let&rsquo;s see Karen from YouTube I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been doing keto and if since March and</p>
<p>have lost 58 pounds</p>
<p>all right that calls for the Bell</p>
<p>congratulations on that I&rsquo;ve also been</p>
<p>diagnosed with a</p>
<p>oh goodness uh Bullis uh Panther gold</p>
<p>p-e-m-p-h-i-g-o-l-d uh blistering to the</p>
<p>skin apparently is what that how can I</p>
<p>get rid of this autoimmune issue I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never heard of a Bullis pimpicode if I</p>
<p>said that right crimp of gold I&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>heard of it either but if we&rsquo;re dealing</p>
<p>with autoimmune we&rsquo;re dealing with uh a</p>
<p>weakened immune system and I think right</p>
<p>off the bat the best thing you could do</p>
<p>for any autoimmune would be too and</p>
<p>especially for the skin that is vitamin</p>
<p>D D3 I have a high quantities uh like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking 30 000 maybe 40 000 IUS</p>
<p>um that would be very important and then</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the other thing too is I&rsquo;d go back to</p>
<p>your diet like is there anything that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating um that could be affecting</p>
<p>the gut because there&rsquo;s a huge</p>
<p>relationship between the gut and your</p>
<p>skin and usually</p>
<p>skin problems are related to something</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating that maybe you shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be eating so I always go back to that uh</p>
<p>you know the basics the obvious thing</p>
<p>first I&rsquo;ll give you just another example</p>
<p>of another possibility</p>
<p>um there was a person who I recently</p>
<p>talked to very fairly young in their 30s</p>
<p>and they had a lot of a lot of you know</p>
<p>fatigue they don&rsquo;t feel right and come</p>
<p>to find out she&rsquo;s on eight medications</p>
<p>anyone with that many poisons I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>medications would not feel quite right</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to feel kind of like</p>
<p>lethargic and so those medications throw</p>
<p>everything off so</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m like why do you need these in the</p>
<p>first place so I said go back to the</p>
<p>dock and see if you get your permission</p>
<p>for me to talk to the doctor</p>
<p>and just to see if we can&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>together to change her diet more and see</p>
<p>if she really needs to be on eight</p>
<p>different drugs which gives so many</p>
<p>different reactions who knows what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>causing what</p>
<p>very good oh oh we better go to Facebook</p>
<p>where Lou pop uh uh indicates it or asks</p>
<p>is it true that following the keto diet</p>
<p>can lead to heart issues can the keto</p>
<p>diet impact muscle function</p>
<p>yes yeah I&rsquo;ve done a video on that it</p>
<p>can greatly greatly improve heart</p>
<p>function it can help your cardiovascular</p>
<p>system greatly</p>
<p>um because all because the alternative</p>
<p>is the you know a lot more carbs and</p>
<p>carbs are really underneath problems in</p>
<p>the arteries with heart issues and</p>
<p>creating deficiencies</p>
<p>so yeah they can definitely improve your</p>
<p>heart cardiovascular function there was</p>
<p>a there was a study of</p>
<p>that said the uh</p>
<p>that oh yeah keto is really bad for your</p>
<p>heart and you then you actually read the</p>
<p>study right and you find out it involved</p>
<p>mice and you find out um they use a high</p>
<p>fat diet</p>
<p>but they also use the high fat high carb</p>
<p>diet so it wasn&rsquo;t keto sometimes people</p>
<p>think a high fat diet is a keto diet</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not so anyone who says that I</p>
<p>always ask who told you that where did</p>
<p>you read it did you actually see the</p>
<p>article no okay well there&rsquo;s definitely</p>
<p>a push to get people away from keto but</p>
<p>I think um</p>
<p>I think the best way if you&rsquo;re confused</p>
<p>is to try keto for a little while and</p>
<p>then go back to your old diet and see</p>
<p>which way you feel better on and then</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ll know so that way you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to take my word for it yep that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>proof positive okay we&rsquo;ve got the</p>
<p>audience right on it after a month uh</p>
<p>out of school and the question asked</p>
<p>what is the most common nutrient</p>
<p>deficiency that keep you tired I&rsquo;m dying</p>
<p>to know this although I belted down some</p>
<p>coffee already and uh forty percent of a</p>
<p>respondents say it&rsquo;s vitamin D 30 C</p>
<p>vitamin B 20 say potassium and the final</p>
<p>10 say magnesium any winners</p>
<p>okay so the ones that said B vitamins</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re pretty close</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually B1 B1</p>
<p>is the spark plug to converting food</p>
<p>carbs proteins and fats into energy in</p>
<p>the little energy Factory the</p>
<p>mitochondria so uh it&rsquo;s a spark plug and</p>
<p>um a lot of people are deficient and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a critical uh nutrient for</p>
<p>um for generating energy and that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>there I don&rsquo;t care what you do what you</p>
<p>eat it&rsquo;s not going to work you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to generate energy but I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>just talking about feeling fatigue and</p>
<p>getting energy from that I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about the energy that&rsquo;s needed to power</p>
<p>the heart the brain and especially the</p>
<p>nervous system and so as you may already</p>
<p>know Steve the uh a real key part of the</p>
<p>nervous system is called the um the</p>
<p>autonomic nervous system where you have</p>
<p>the flight or fight uh system and</p>
<p>um without enough B vitamin what happens</p>
<p>B1 specifically</p>
<p>you get stuck in the flight mode or</p>
<p>fight mode and you&rsquo;re kind of uh very</p>
<p>reactive on edge you can fly off the</p>
<p>handle easily</p>
<p>um you don&rsquo;t tolerate stress so</p>
<p>babysitting a lot of small kids over</p>
<p>eight hours in a small room poorly</p>
<p>ventilated would be very stressful to</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>um driving is getting stuck in traffic</p>
<p>for over three hours could be very</p>
<p>stressful to you so all these things</p>
<p>could build up and increase their need</p>
<p>for B1</p>
<p>the other thing too is that the question</p>
<p>is can you get B1 from the diet it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of difficult if you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>you know just like drinking a lot of</p>
<p>coffee for example caffeine tea or red</p>
<p>wine all that all those who are like</p>
<p>anti-b1 and alcohol like in general so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll actually a lot of people are are</p>
<p>consuming maybe good foods but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>consuming these other things that are</p>
<p>depleting them not knowing they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>deficient in B1 and then all of a sudden</p>
<p>they</p>
<p>their sleeping&rsquo;s not right they get up</p>
<p>they feel dizzy</p>
<p>um their pulse rate goes up all these</p>
<p>kind of really strange symptoms occur</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not connecting the dots so</p>
<p>stay tuned for a video that I will</p>
<p>release on that coming up in about a</p>
<p>week I think it&rsquo;s a very valuable</p>
<p>important video on</p>
<p>on B1 deficiencies and how it can just</p>
<p>restore your energy I have experienced</p>
<p>Steve I&rsquo;m an expert I was I had fatigue</p>
<p>for 20 years</p>
<p>goodness well thanks for your exhaustive</p>
<p>research on that part in the pun</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see uh oh by the way folks</p>
<p>um Dr Berg&rsquo;s app and I&rsquo;m sorry I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a little logo up yet but Dr Berg&rsquo;s</p>
<p>uh app is a great resource to find in</p>
<p>order all of his various videos and you</p>
<p>can get that on Android or Apple so just</p>
<p>go there Dr Berg app and it&rsquo;ll be easy</p>
<p>to find in addition to of course</p>
<p>drberg.com which you all are probably</p>
<p>watching uh the show through and so on</p>
<p>so don&rsquo;t forget to find those resources</p>
<p>but as Dr Berg has mentioned before</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s a little difficult to</p>
<p>search on YouTube to find the video you</p>
<p>want but they&rsquo;ve all been greatly</p>
<p>perfectly categorized in the Dr Berg app</p>
<p>so go there now but don&rsquo;t tune us out</p>
<p>stay tuned in addition to</p>
<p>um in a titch into lupock from Facebook</p>
<p>who asked about keto here&rsquo;s the folks</p>
<p>that are listening to us around the</p>
<p>world including Europe where you just</p>
<p>hence you came from let&rsquo;s say a good</p>
<p>morning to our viewers from the UK</p>
<p>Canada Columbia Croatia Switzerland</p>
<p>Ghana Italy Denmark India Saudi Arabia</p>
<p>Iraq South Africa Romania Georgia</p>
<p>Austria France the Czech Republic</p>
<p>Zanzibar Jamaica Trinidad Tobago Armenia</p>
<p>the Philippines thank you we had one of</p>
<p>our guests from there Mr McKay a Papua</p>
<p>New Guinea the Netherlands Pakistan</p>
<p>Australia Ireland Nigeria Japan turkey</p>
<p>the Dominican Republic Roland Thailand</p>
<p>Poland excuse me Thailand Pakistan</p>
<p>Mexico chile Peru Belgium what a list</p>
<p>Greece Qatar Germany Bermuda Ethiopia</p>
<p>Egypt Bahrain and all across the United</p>
<p>States and we have a gentleman from</p>
<p>Kosovo coming in this morning dire I</p>
<p>believe is his name and dire I want you</p>
<p>to unmute yourself and give it to us</p>
<p>straight from Kosovo you&rsquo;re on with Dr</p>
<p>Byrd yes yes hello I&rsquo;m from Kosovo nice</p>
<p>talking to you Dr Barry</p>
<p>uh so can I make the question or wait no</p>
<p>go ahead go ahead yes go ahead okay yeah</p>
<p>my my question was simple I just wanted</p>
<p>to make sure because uh you know a</p>
<p>doctor from Kosovo said to me that you</p>
<p>have a little dandruff you know dandruff</p>
<p>so she told me to use uh casserole</p>
<p>shampoo and this shampoo if you can see</p>
<p>oh wait there you go</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called Richie how can you know it</p>
<p>so I was scared to use them because I</p>
<p>watch your videos and you said that uh</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to use shampoos with uh</p>
<p>selenium</p>
<p>you know that that one way selenium</p>
<p>sulfate you know yes that&rsquo;s right so</p>
<p>uh before before this shampoo before</p>
<p>wishing shampoo I used Head and</p>
<p>Shoulders but my hair hair keep like you</p>
<p>know hurt or it was like a nature skin</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why I went to that doctor and</p>
<p>she said to use this vishi I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>better than head and shoulders because</p>
<p>my hair is no more itching the things</p>
<p>but you know I&rsquo;m still afraid because</p>
<p>you said that you don&rsquo;t have to use with</p>
<p>selenium well here&rsquo;s just my viewpoint</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m glad you brought this up because</p>
<p>I think the the thing that I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>you know looking at is what&rsquo;s causing</p>
<p>the problem in the first place right you</p>
<p>get rid of this the indicator the</p>
<p>symptom</p>
<p>and then um same thing with uh we just</p>
<p>talked about B1 with energy you if you</p>
<p>have fatigue you can drink coffee and</p>
<p>get your energy back but why are you</p>
<p>tired in the first place why do you have</p>
<p>psoriasis in the first place</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s been highly correlated with a</p>
<p>low vitamin D levels so you might want</p>
<p>to start taking that let&rsquo;s say for</p>
<p>example you take vitamin D</p>
<p>um and most people take like maybe you</p>
<p>know a thousand milligrams or two</p>
<p>thousand milligrams and they think oh</p>
<p>yeah I&rsquo;m good but there&rsquo;s so many other</p>
<p>things that can decrease the absorption</p>
<p>of that vitamin D like even genetic</p>
<p>weaknesses</p>
<p>um I recently did a genetic test and I</p>
<p>found my own weaknesses and and then</p>
<p>also someone else would take it and they</p>
<p>found they had a defect in their vitamin</p>
<p>D receptor which means the normal</p>
<p>amounts are not going to even touch the</p>
<p>vitamin D deficiency so they had to take</p>
<p>like 30 or 40 000 I used to make the</p>
<p>make the connection</p>
<p>um so these are just things I would I</p>
<p>would watch the video apply it but the</p>
<p>the shampoos are working on it topically</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not looking at the whole picture</p>
<p>of of why you have it in the first place</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a microbe involved too you have</p>
<p>microbes that live on the scalp so you</p>
<p>should be um</p>
<p>you know watch my video on</p>
<p>reestablishing the the Flora on their</p>
<p>skin and make sure you&rsquo;re not having</p>
<p>like fluoride or too much chloride in</p>
<p>your um your water supply when you take</p>
<p>a shower so if you get a filter that</p>
<p>filters that stuff out it can help you</p>
<p>greatly so</p>
<p>you know even women that use a lot of</p>
<p>the hair dyes unfortunately that it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>toxic to the microbes and then you kill</p>
<p>those off and then you get rashes and</p>
<p>uh all sorts of issues that can happen</p>
<p>with the scalp in your skin so</p>
<p>keep watching the videos and um she</p>
<p>applied that she also she also said to</p>
<p>take vitamin B6 you know one</p>
<p>100 milligram per day yeah B6 is</p>
<p>probably not going to be the big one</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s kind of a</p>
<p>a catch-all thing that can help you to</p>
<p>some degree but it&rsquo;s not the the real</p>
<p>dramatic you know effect that I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get Beast by taking these six</p>
<p>no my question was uh which which</p>
<p>shampoo would you recommend me</p>
<p>I would recommend the one that&rsquo;s least</p>
<p>toxic and I would have to kind of</p>
<p>research both of those and see what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking but uh</p>
<p>um I couldn&rsquo;t really tell you exactly</p>
<p>without looking at the ingredients and</p>
<p>everything and so I would just watch my</p>
<p>video on that and um also watch my video</p>
<p>on on um on some of the shampoos I have</p>
<p>videos on that and and what it can do to</p>
<p>your hair and then you&rsquo;ll get more</p>
<p>information dire thanks so much for</p>
<p>participating with us I really</p>
<p>appreciate it we&rsquo;ll have to move along</p>
<p>now and in fact we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna go on to our next question</p>
<p>uh sure let&rsquo;s see and that one I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>already asked uh</p>
<p>and I are if you&rsquo;re talking with us so</p>
<p>we have you muted to the audience so we</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t hear that but I&rsquo;m sure you got</p>
<p>some counsel from Dr Berg and here we go</p>
<p>a true falser</p>
<p>okay so true or false benign tumors are</p>
<p>a form of cancer is that true or is that</p>
<p>false</p>
<p>all right dig into that folks and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see uh how about another question from</p>
<p>YouTube Oliver from YouTube are pumpkin</p>
<p>seeds good to consume since they contain</p>
<p>a lot of Omega-3s do they</p>
<p>well they can no I wouldn&rsquo;t say a lot</p>
<p>they can they contain something called</p>
<p>ala which is a precursor it&rsquo;s a building</p>
<p>block to the active form but it&rsquo;s not an</p>
<p>active form of the one that you need the</p>
<p>omega-3 so</p>
<p>um no they&rsquo;re not going to give you a</p>
<p>good Supply but they but they apparently</p>
<p>are good for prostate you know so maybe</p>
<p>that can help you</p>
<p>um and so it&rsquo;s you know I would roast</p>
<p>them and</p>
<p>consume them that way especially since</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s uh you know a lot of people are you</p>
<p>know have their pumpkins outside right</p>
<p>now might as well eat the seeds and you</p>
<p>can dry them out put some nice sea salt</p>
<p>on it I think that would be a good good</p>
<p>thing to take</p>
<p>um but yeah so uh</p>
<p>I they don&rsquo;t have a lot of Omega-3 you</p>
<p>just have the precursor a little bit of</p>
<p>the precursor just like walnuts walnuts</p>
<p>are great</p>
<p>um for many reasons and they have the</p>
<p>precursor uh to the Omega-3</p>
<p>and out of all the nut I think the</p>
<p>walnut would be one of the best nuts out</p>
<p>there and then the pecan would be the</p>
<p>next one after that wow very delicious</p>
<p>okay uh she hasn&rsquo;t given us uh much</p>
<p>information but Caitlyn from YouTube</p>
<p>poor thing wakes up nauseous and gagging</p>
<p>could this be a nutritional deficiency</p>
<p>of some kind I don&rsquo;t know if she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pregnant or what the problem but is</p>
<p>there a general cause for nausea and</p>
<p>gagging</p>
<p>yeah yeah</p>
<p>um pregnancy no</p>
<p>um I think what&rsquo;s happening is um that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>usually a B1 deficiencies if you feel</p>
<p>like a nauseous or you even feel like</p>
<p>vomiting that I would take some B1 right</p>
<p>away</p>
<p>um B1 also works on the nervous system</p>
<p>that connects to the digestive system we</p>
<p>also have so anything nerve is like bb1</p>
<p>including the vagus nerve which happens</p>
<p>to go through that area and innervate</p>
<p>the stomach and the gallbladder and in</p>
<p>the large and small intestine so I would</p>
<p>take B1 as the as the antidote to that</p>
<p>and of course I would also look at what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating because I haven&rsquo;t you know</p>
<p>I it&rsquo;s hard to evaluate someone without</p>
<p>getting more information so it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>well my best guess that&rsquo;s what I gave</p>
<p>you but if I could get a list of what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating then I can really know you</p>
<p>know so that&rsquo;s helpful yeah Caitlyn make</p>
<p>sure you&rsquo;re right uh Dr Berg Dr Bergen</p>
<p>Dr berg.com is that right doc did I get</p>
<p>the email right</p>
<p>um Dr Berg Dr berg.com yeah very good</p>
<p>Caitlin let us have a few more details</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll try to get to the</p>
<p>bottom of that with you and speaking of</p>
<p>getting the bottom of something the true</p>
<p>false question has already gotten some</p>
<p>answers which asks true false benign</p>
<p>tumors are a form of cancer and uh</p>
<p>interestingly 65 percent of our</p>
<p>respondents oh I&rsquo;m sorry 65 say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>false which I would agree with 35</p>
<p>percent say it&rsquo;s true but who cares what</p>
<p>I say what&rsquo;s right doc</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s false so yeah uh when you</p>
<p>have a benign tumor it&rsquo;s not cancer</p>
<p>cancer is when it becomes malignant and</p>
<p>it can spread so a benign tumor whether</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a polyp or even a skin tag okay</p>
<p>those are benign tumors</p>
<p>um they&rsquo;re not going to keep growing and</p>
<p>take over the body and they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not considered cancer</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to release another video next</p>
<p>week</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>on skin tag simply because</p>
<p>um you know they&rsquo;re a really good</p>
<p>indicator or like a little</p>
<p>um gives you a little red light</p>
<p>indicator that there&rsquo;s something deeper</p>
<p>in the body usually insulin resistance</p>
<p>and so yeah there&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s really simple</p>
<p>to get rid of skin tags and I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>show you how to do it but then you also</p>
<p>have to fix the real problem underneath</p>
<p>the whole thing and I think</p>
<p>unfortunately our society is doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>look at cause effect relationship you</p>
<p>really have to think like an engineer to</p>
<p>be able to think of cause and effect</p>
<p>because um</p>
<p>in the medical profession they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t do that it&rsquo;s all about the</p>
<p>suppression of symptoms using medication</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so but that&rsquo;s about it so just the</p>
<p>videos that I&rsquo;m trying to do to help</p>
<p>people and apparently there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>people interested in alternative method</p>
<p>simply because I just last week I</p>
<p>counted up how many subscribers we have</p>
<p>on all the languages of this YouTube</p>
<p>channel there&rsquo;s 18 million subscribers</p>
<p>so I was shocked and amazed and blown</p>
<p>away that</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s such a great interest in</p>
<p>alternative</p>
<p>you know things to medicine so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>really happy that people are finding the</p>
<p>channel and subscribing no kid what</p>
<p>amazing numbers now speaking of amazing</p>
<p>next up we&rsquo;ve got Mr Cruz Hill and he</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t think he was going to get some</p>
<p>good ratings without bringing his</p>
<p>beautiful wife on so she is also in the</p>
<p>scene go ahead you can lean in there</p>
<p>miss Hill and uh let&rsquo;s see what they</p>
<p>have to say Cruise your own with Dr Berg</p>
<p>go ahead sir hello there Dr Burke thank</p>
<p>you for your time I uh so I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>following you for oh you&rsquo;re muted uh</p>
<p>quite quite some years now okay</p>
<p>now I can hear you really</p>
<p>can you hear us now yeah I can hear you</p>
<p>now okay I&rsquo;ve been following thank you</p>
<p>all right thank you for your time yeah</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been following you for for quite</p>
<p>some time now and um my main issue right</p>
<p>now is I&rsquo;ve been doing the keto diet for</p>
<p>three months I do think that I&rsquo;m finally</p>
<p>in ketosis but</p>
<p>it was up to just</p>
<p>it my body was just fighting me to get</p>
<p>into ketosis and I know I had a few</p>
<p>medicines that they were in the mix they</p>
<p>were probably culprits right now I&rsquo;m on</p>
<p>the metformin I&rsquo;m Type B diabetic and uh</p>
<p>also Lyrica I recently got rid of Lyrica</p>
<p>and it seemed like my body went into</p>
<p>ketosis but my sugar still seemed like</p>
<p>they want to fight me a little bit</p>
<p>not as bad good they&rsquo;re not 300. that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good</p>
<p>um what what is your blood sugar</p>
<p>recently</p>
<p>so like this morning it&rsquo;s been an</p>
<p>average</p>
<p>like right now it&rsquo;s 1 15. okay that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good but</p>
<p>right I agree but in the past whenever I</p>
<p>was in ketosis it would always I</p>
<p>remember it always being between 85 and</p>
<p>95 somewhere around there and and it and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gone there it&rsquo;s gone down to about</p>
<ol start="95">
<li>you know it&rsquo;s like two weeks but</li>
</ol>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s a lot better it was fighting</p>
<p>me quite a bit even though I was doing</p>
<p>keto it would still go up to like uh</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>150 and that was with me not having no</p>
<p>carbs I mean hardcore Keto yeah</p>
<p>so okay sorry I guess my question was</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still on the myth I&rsquo;m on the</p>
<p>metformin yeah uh should I stop taking</p>
<p>the myth</p>
<p>yeah good question of course I I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>tell you not to I can&rsquo;t tell you to stop</p>
<p>taking it but I&rsquo;m just going to give you</p>
<p>information okay that you can determine</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>metformin um</p>
<p>does help the insulin resistance problem</p>
<p>because it makes the cells more</p>
<p>sensitive and that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>helping you in one way but there are</p>
<p>some side effects that&rsquo;s why it has a</p>
<p>black label on it so you know lactic</p>
<p>acidosis that&rsquo;s what I don&rsquo;t like about</p>
<p>it it also depletes your B1 and b12 so I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like that</p>
<p>um so here&rsquo;s the thing the reason why</p>
<p>your uh you eat no sugar and your blood</p>
<p>sugars are even there are higher than</p>
<p>they should be is because of the insulin</p>
<p>resistance and that causes your liver to</p>
<p>make new sugar it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>gluconeogenesis from</p>
<p>fat protein and even ketones so it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>coming from your diet it&rsquo;s just coming</p>
<p>because you have you have a chronic</p>
<p>blood sugar problem from the past it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to take a while to get you to a</p>
<p>point where your insulin resistance is</p>
<p>in check and now you have normal blood</p>
<p>sugar so so many people</p>
<p>that do this they might end up with like</p>
<p>why is my blood sugars High I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>eating any sugar well that&rsquo;s because you</p>
<p>have insulin resistance for so long it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to take a while for your body to</p>
<p>adapt so I would just maintain what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing make sure it&rsquo;s clean</p>
<p>for some weeks longer maybe a few more</p>
<p>months and then you&rsquo;ll see the blood</p>
<p>sugar will come down to like 80 or even</p>
<ol start="70">
<li>and then you know your insulin</li>
</ol>
<p>resistance is a lot better there are a</p>
<p>lot of other things you can do to speed</p>
<p>up the process like apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>before bed you know in some in some</p>
<p>water you can also take berberine</p>
<p>awesome awesome stuff you can take</p>
<p>vitamin D and you definitely could take</p>
<p>B1 and natural B1 which</p>
<p>by the way we&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>kind of also counter what that</p>
<p>medication is doing right now</p>
<p>so and then as the blood sugars come</p>
<p>down get with your doctor to decrease</p>
<p>the amount of it and that because you</p>
<p>you know you won&rsquo;t need it you know over</p>
<p>a period of time so I I like what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing you just have to realize that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s normal and it&rsquo;s going to take</p>
<p>some more time</p>
<p>can I ask a quick question as well sure</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>go ahead okay</p>
<p>um your thoughts thank you your thoughts</p>
<p>I know that you can&rsquo;t direct me in any</p>
<p>way medically but I want your thoughts</p>
<p>so I was diagnosed with breast cancer I</p>
<p>am bracha positive</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;ve since had surgery took it out it</p>
<p>was minuscule amount in the lymph nodes</p>
<p>supposedly my margins which equals</p>
<p>slight margin was not clear I do not</p>
<p>want to take any forms of radiation</p>
<p>chemotherapy I want to do alternative</p>
<p>what are your thoughts on um B17 or</p>
<p>anything else that you and you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to go into detail you can just name</p>
<p>things they&rsquo;ve researched quite a bit</p>
<p>but I have access to B17</p>
<p>um the actual apricot trees what are</p>
<p>your thoughts on that or peroxide on the</p>
<p>skin or ingesting</p>
<p>yeah Leia Trail I mean like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting it&rsquo;s like if if I put a</p>
<p>video out on B17 they will shut my</p>
<p>channel down so it&rsquo;s highly sensitive</p>
<p>topics so what I&rsquo;m going to just tell</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>um the same thing with hydrogen peroxide</p>
<p>if you take if well topically but if you</p>
<p>tell someone to take it orally like boom</p>
<p>not a good thing but here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>um I would watch all my cancer videos uh</p>
<p>and I would definitely apply a lot of</p>
<p>fasting as the primary thing and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking about regular intermittent</p>
<p>fasting like definitely one meal a day</p>
<p>and then you got you have to start</p>
<p>extending that to like even on the</p>
<p>weekends you have 48 hour fast and then</p>
<p>maybe once a month you do</p>
<p>even a four or five day fast and the</p>
<p>reason for that it&rsquo;s going to strengthen</p>
<p>your immune system it is the</p>
<p>the uh the key most important thing to</p>
<p>turn things around for you um and then</p>
<p>on top of that there&rsquo;s a protocol we did</p>
<p>research uh yes it was on mice but it</p>
<p>was based on a very sound uh theory that</p>
<p>seems to look very promising by using</p>
<p>certain remedies to inhibit this thing</p>
<p>called Scott which is a strategy to not</p>
<p>just start not necessarily starve the</p>
<p>cancer Off fuel wise but to starve the</p>
<p>material for its membrane to build a</p>
<p>membrane so that way it doesn&rsquo;t it can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>if it can&rsquo;t do that it can&rsquo;t survive and</p>
<p>we did you know I invested a good amount</p>
<p>of money you said it&rsquo;s called the Scott</p>
<p>Inhibitors but it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a video</p>
<p>um if you look through my video on on</p>
<p>cancer you&rsquo;ll find it it&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>ones that I said I I revealed a cancer</p>
<p>research uh the results and you can and</p>
<p>I and there&rsquo;s links to the protocol and</p>
<p>um and none of those remedies uh are any</p>
<p>of my products I&rsquo;m not it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>something I would recommend finding on</p>
<p>your own but</p>
<p>um but what&rsquo;s interesting about this uh</p>
<p>cancer because I interviewed several</p>
<p>people and you should watch each of</p>
<p>those interviews and what they did with</p>
<p>stage four cancer I&rsquo;m talking like the</p>
<p>worst almost the worst case scenario</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>like even one of the guys we interviewed</p>
<p>his name is Guy tunnelbaum he went from</p>
<p>stage four to zero cancer right and uh</p>
<p>he</p>
<p>he just and this has been several years</p>
<p>right now he&rsquo;s like cancer-free and so</p>
<p>the doctor I says I want the report I</p>
<p>want the report and so the doctor</p>
<p>finally gave us a report I&rsquo;m like why</p>
<p>could he not just put down there he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cancer-free and his reply was the</p>
<p>medical doctor&rsquo;s reply was um well we</p>
<p>like to we can talk about cancer but if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have cancer we don&rsquo;t like to</p>
<p>emphasize those those those symptoms</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have it anymore and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like what that&rsquo;s illogical so he</p>
<p>just couldn&rsquo;t come out and say he was</p>
<p>cancer-free but he did say indirectly it</p>
<p>was cancer-free all the indicators but</p>
<p>anyway</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fine but the point is that I</p>
<p>would really emphasize more fasting now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably in a situation where you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily have to do the</p>
<p>extreme fasting like if you had some</p>
<p>malignancy that was spreading through</p>
<p>the through the body in which case you</p>
<p>would want to fast for like</p>
<p>you know a month but um but I would</p>
<p>definitely do at least periodic</p>
<p>prolonged fasting to help yourself and I</p>
<p>think that you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll be put in good</p>
<p>shape and then if it was of the cancer</p>
<p>of the breast you want to be taking</p>
<p>um C kelp on a regular basis as well</p>
<p>because uh that has a good amount of</p>
<p>iodine that can help regulate your</p>
<p>estrogen and keep it and also</p>
<p>cruciferous cruciferous Foods so those</p>
<p>are the two things I would I would</p>
<p>recommend</p>
<p>all right Hill family I think</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry go ahead</p>
<p>oh I was just gonna say thank you I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>also on the keto diet so I appreciate</p>
<p>your input</p>
<p>that is terrific just one more just one</p>
<p>more question I&rsquo;m sorry it was the very</p>
<p>quickly I was supposed to ask you and it</p>
<p>was</p>
<p>very quickly basal insulin</p>
<p>can can I still be in ketosis and use a</p>
<p>small amount of basal insulin because I</p>
<p>kind of I stopped it cold turkey</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>well uh</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;ll that&rsquo;ll bump you out of</p>
<p>ketosis for sure</p>
<p>um so I can&rsquo;t tell you not to take it</p>
<p>but the thing is like the whole goal of</p>
<p>Keto is to re-establish the health of</p>
<p>your insulin right and uh what triggers</p>
<p>insulin is carbs so if you&rsquo;re taking the</p>
<p>insulin to regulate the blood sugars</p>
<p>um you kind of go in the opposite</p>
<p>direction but I&rsquo;m not telling you not to</p>
<p>take it but I would just learn more</p>
<p>about it so you can decide on your own</p>
<p>but um I mean you&rsquo;re taking metformin</p>
<p>and Insulin I mean like or no you took</p>
<p>you came off of it if your blood sugars</p>
<p>came down to 118 I mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>significant the question is do you</p>
<p>really need that Sledgehammer of a tool</p>
<p>to get your blood sugars down because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the most potent thing you can do</p>
<p>to drop blood sugars so</p>
<p>anyway that&rsquo;s my thought all right folks</p>
<p>so listen thanks so much for the hill</p>
<p>family and we uh you know wish you all</p>
<p>the well and hope that you uh keep us</p>
<p>posted on your various uh health</p>
<p>benefits uh doing a nice healthy</p>
<p>lifestyle so let&rsquo;s go to the next</p>
<p>question and then we&rsquo;re going to hit</p>
<p>social media hard and make sure that we</p>
<p>get some questions out there okay here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the next question for you sir</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>all right what is the common denominator</p>
<p>between the plaque on your teeth and the</p>
<p>plaque in your arteries</p>
<p>All Right audience climb on that and</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see speaking of the audience we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to go to YouTube Stephen wants to</p>
<p>know what the best time of day is to</p>
<p>take berberine</p>
<p>well I think um</p>
<p>I would take it um whenever you want</p>
<p>your blood sugar if whenever you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>wherever your blood sugars are the</p>
<p>highest so if you have like the dawn</p>
<p>phenomena where you wake up in the</p>
<p>morning your blood sugars are high take</p>
<p>it first thing in the morning</p>
<p>um if it happens in the afternoon take</p>
<p>it maybe an hour before that so anytime</p>
<p>you want to keep the blood sugars low</p>
<p>because berberine is a very powerful I</p>
<p>mean it kind of compares to metformin</p>
<p>like a natural version of Metformin</p>
<p>um without the side effects so</p>
<p>all right very good let&rsquo;s see uh Terry</p>
<p>help me with this MCT and MC maybe from</p>
<p>Facebook if you&rsquo;re a type 1 diabetic how</p>
<p>would you do intermittent fasting</p>
<p>you should definitely watch my recent</p>
<p>video on type 1 diabetes and I</p>
<p>interviewed Manuel and Steve you know</p>
<p>Manuel again he&rsquo;s a type 1 diabetic and</p>
<p>I worked with them a little bit and oh</p>
<p>my goodness he&rsquo;s the amount of insulin</p>
<p>that he needs now is so tiny and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>doing great and he&rsquo;s doing uh if I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>mistaken one meal a day and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>exercising like crazy he&rsquo;s getting fit</p>
<p>he feels better</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s a miracle so um</p>
<p>the thing is that do you want you know</p>
<p>as a</p>
<p>diabetic type one you know you need to</p>
<p>take insulin but the question is how</p>
<p>much do you really need to take</p>
<p>um take the least amount possible that</p>
<p>you need to establish good blood sugars</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re because that extra</p>
<p>insulin creates problems big problems</p>
<p>um side effects and if you don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>me look up</p>
<p>um uh hyperinsulinemia and you will</p>
<p>learn all about that</p>
<p>well Manuel that is such exciting news</p>
<p>we all love them he&rsquo;s a big part of the</p>
<p>behind the scenes of the show and uh so</p>
<p>thumbs up to a following Dr Berg&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Council and it sounds like it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>well Betty Sue from Facebook my</p>
<p>electrolytes are always below normal and</p>
<p>my blood pressure is high my adrenals</p>
<p>have been tested as normal I can&rsquo;t find</p>
<p>a root cause any thoughts</p>
<p>um yeah if you if you&rsquo;re not retaining</p>
<p>these uh electrolytes I mean I mean the</p>
<p>question I have is is there a problem</p>
<p>with the kidney or maybe there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>problem with your stomach your pH and</p>
<p>your stomach is not acid enough if the</p>
<p>stomach doesn&rsquo;t have enough acid and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s between one and three it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really hard to absorb these minerals so</p>
<p>they kind of they don&rsquo;t get absorbed and</p>
<p>so here you are like it&rsquo;s kind of going</p>
<p>right through you uh so that&rsquo;s one one</p>
<p>factor also the absorption could could</p>
<p>be inhibited by a problem in your gut</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>so my other question is why do you think</p>
<p>your deficient electrolytes in the first</p>
<p>place is this not based on a blood test</p>
<p>or some symptom and and I would need to</p>
<p>ask the question so that&rsquo;s as far as I</p>
<p>can go without trying to go back and</p>
<p>forth with you but</p>
<p>very good okay the two key electrolytes</p>
<p>like potassium and magnesium you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really get a good picture of what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on in your blood because 98 of</p>
<p>those minerals are inside the cell so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to do like an</p>
<p>intracellular test and that requires a</p>
<p>whole different thing so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;d be curious about did you do</p>
<p>that test did that show up low and and</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say it did and that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about realize that it takes it</p>
<p>could take weeks or months to get those</p>
<p>levels back to where they normally</p>
<p>should be sometimes you think like oh I</p>
<p>can do it in a day no it takes a period</p>
<p>of time to reestablish uh nutrient</p>
<p>deficiencies even B1 it could take</p>
<p>months if you&rsquo;re very very deficient</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll feel better in the process but it</p>
<p>could take a long time</p>
<p>all right uh Amy from Facebook can you</p>
<p>suggest any help for fibromyalgia</p>
<p>ouch</p>
<p>well I would I would go right to B1</p>
<p>first of all because</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s one common thing is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to generate too much lactic</p>
<p>acid if you don&rsquo;t have B1 and that can</p>
<p>create symptoms of fibromyalgia there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another there&rsquo;s other two things that</p>
<p>come to mind one is it&rsquo;s not really</p>
<p>fibromyalgia it&rsquo;s a gallbladder problem</p>
<p>and the the bile ducts are jammed up and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s backing up pressure into the right</p>
<p>side causing fibromyalgia mainly on the</p>
<p>right side of your body so if it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>on the right side of your body assume</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s problems with your bile ducts and I</p>
<p>have a lot of videos on that the remedy</p>
<p>would be tadka it&rsquo;s a simple uh solution</p>
<p>and then the last possibility could be</p>
<p>um a low-grade</p>
<p>um kind of a systemic infection of</p>
<p>either chronic uh</p>
<p>um Epstein-Barr virus or cytomegalovirus</p>
<p>or some type of virus that&rsquo;s in the body</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>kind of goes in and out of remission</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of a latent virus that comes</p>
<p>out when you&rsquo;re under stress and that</p>
<p>can keep keep your body achy inflamed</p>
<p>and tired</p>
<p>in which case you have to deal with the</p>
<p>stress that&rsquo;s activating it because the</p>
<p>stress paralyzes the immune system to</p>
<p>allow these viruses to come out of</p>
<p>remission it&rsquo;s always the stress and so</p>
<p>some people just have to figure out how</p>
<p>to get rid of that stress because under</p>
<p>that stress it&rsquo;s you know if you&rsquo;re in a</p>
<p>situation I don&rsquo;t care what you take</p>
<p>nutritionally</p>
<p>that stress is going to keep you in that</p>
<p>mode because it keeps the virus kind of</p>
<p>free-floating doing damage interesting</p>
<p>okay here&rsquo;s some uh</p>
<p>uh fun stuff from uh Facebook Noreen</p>
<p>from Facebook wants to thank you for all</p>
<p>your videos I love them and thank you</p>
<p>from your followers in Ireland so thank</p>
<p>you Noreen for checking in with us and</p>
<p>then here&rsquo;s another great one Tara from</p>
<p>Facebook I have lost 80 pounds doing</p>
<p>your Healthy keto and if</p>
<p>thank you so much Dr Berg what a great</p>
<p>note that is</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s awesome all right let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>another question someday I want to go to</p>
<p>Ireland I&rsquo;ve never been but I um I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where they create the kerrygold</p>
<p>butter which I I like so much so uh I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>love to go check that out yum all right</p>
<p>Dr Berg another question</p>
<p>all right what is the common denominator</p>
<p>between plaque okay well we already did</p>
<p>that one but do you have an answer to</p>
<p>that well I&rsquo;m sorry that&rsquo;s what it was</p>
<p>about thank you for keeping me on track</p>
<p>all right the question was what is the</p>
<p>common denominator between the plaque on</p>
<p>your teeth and the plaque in your</p>
<p>arteries and the astute audience seventy</p>
<p>percent of them say calcium or</p>
<p>calcification 20 say sugars or high carb</p>
<p>levels and the last 10 percent say</p>
<p>bacteria or biofilm sounds like</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s been studying</p>
<p>yeah the answer is biofilms now what are</p>
<p>what are biofilms uh they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>kind of a collection group of uh colony</p>
<p>of microbes that band together that then</p>
<p>form a slime shell and then a calcium</p>
<p>shell</p>
<p>95 of all the bacteria in the</p>
<p>environment is living in biofilms even</p>
<p>if you walk through a stream and uh</p>
<p>reach down and feel like these rocks</p>
<p>they have this slippery that&rsquo;s biofilms</p>
<p>so the biofilms also can get can grow in</p>
<p>excess and form tartar on your teeth as</p>
<p>well as the calcium in your arteries the</p>
<p>calcium plaquing in the arteries they</p>
<p>found biofilms behind that which is</p>
<p>fascinating so the question is what can</p>
<p>you do</p>
<p>to get rid of these biofilms well in the</p>
<p>arteries they tend to get stuck on uh</p>
<p>surfaces that are not smooth so what</p>
<p>would create an unsmooth area in your</p>
<p>arteries would be some type of damage</p>
<p>inflammation usually from sugar in</p>
<p>refined carbs right or</p>
<p>omega-3 oils that could do it and so</p>
<p>that way these microbes don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>chance to accumulate and develop these</p>
<p>Barnacle type things in fact</p>
<p>um if you if you take a look one problem</p>
<p>with Sailors is these Barnacles on the</p>
<p>under the bottom of their boats because</p>
<p>they weigh things down and they require</p>
<p>more fuel because you have all these</p>
<p>huge calcium</p>
<p>shells that develop in these organisms</p>
<p>that grow and they use different paints</p>
<p>um toxic paints to try to kill them</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a big problem but um</p>
<p>believe it or not</p>
<p>um one sailor and I think 1990 came up</p>
<p>with this great idea as he was eating a</p>
<p>sandwich with uh these hot hot sauce and</p>
<p>he had this idea he said I wonder if we</p>
<p>we put hot sauce or hot peppers on these</p>
<p>Barnacles underneath the ship and</p>
<p>voila it works so he developed this</p>
<p>paint paint with these peppers and</p>
<p>apparently it&rsquo;s not just the uh the</p>
<p>pepper chemical but it&rsquo;s the vitamin C</p>
<p>vitamin C that kills the biofilms so</p>
<p>um I will be releasing a video on that</p>
<p>topic you could use even ascorbic acid</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s non-GMO in your mouth as kind of</p>
<p>a mouthwash to kind of kill this tartar</p>
<p>in your teeth and of course it also</p>
<p>helps the arteries as well so</p>
<p>um vitamin C is a good thing to inhibit</p>
<p>the formation of the biofilms to your</p>
<p>body okay very good we&rsquo;re going to go to</p>
<p>another person in our Green Room uh</p>
<p>Susan but first let&rsquo;s get another</p>
<p>question out of the way here it is Dr</p>
<p>Berg</p>
<p>okay true or false GERD</p>
<p>heartburn and acid reflux are the result</p>
<p>of too much acid production is that true</p>
<p>or false</p>
<p>all right very good uh jump on that and</p>
<p>folks and Susan thanks so much for</p>
<p>joining us uh we&rsquo;re low on time so if</p>
<p>you can give us one quick question for</p>
<p>Dr Berg we would appreciate it you are</p>
<p>on the air with Dr Berg Susan</p>
<p>great I I have been</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and cider vinegar</p>
<p>and everything for six months now and</p>
<p>um when I went to my doctor to get</p>
<p>checkups I&rsquo;m taking quite a few of the</p>
<p>supplements that you create also</p>
<p>um my cholesterol levels are 242.</p>
<p>and so the doctor gives me this routine</p>
<p>about you know going on a low fat diet</p>
<p>and all those things which of course is</p>
<p>actually opposite to what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>and the other number that&rsquo;s off that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not sure about is the</p>
<p>172.8 for my vitamin D3</p>
<p>and she says that&rsquo;s uh toxic you know I</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t be taking I should go off the</p>
<p>thing and um uh stop it for five or six</p>
<p>months I&rsquo;m taking your K2 and</p>
<p>um uh B uh you know I&rsquo;m taking your</p>
<p>supplement so because I believe from</p>
<p>watching your videos and I had a liver</p>
<p>issue and maybe even bile and</p>
<p>gallbladder so I&rsquo;ve been taking a bunch</p>
<p>of your supplements to kind of get my</p>
<p>body back in shape I never needed to</p>
<p>lose weight it&rsquo;s just the intermittent</p>
<p>fasting is wonderful</p>
<p>so I just wanted some insight into those</p>
<p>numbers which they say the traditional I</p>
<p>say are dangerous and I don&rsquo;t feel I</p>
<p>feel wonderful so what what should you</p>
<p>know should I call it a bit on the</p>
<p>vitamin D</p>
<p>well maybe this is what I would</p>
<p>recommend there&rsquo;s a great new video a</p>
<p>recent video that I did put out on the</p>
<p>toxicity of vitamin D you should watch</p>
<p>that if you haven&rsquo;t already but I go</p>
<p>into how much D is really toxic and how</p>
<p>much you can tolerate before there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>problem and and even the problem would</p>
<p>be the biggest problem would be kidney</p>
<p>stones in which you could solve by just</p>
<p>taking 2.5 liters of fluid a day you</p>
<p>know that that would just take you out</p>
<p>of that risk factor but you should watch</p>
<p>that video uh that I did recently</p>
<p>probably at least I think it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>Maybe</p>
<p>somewhere in the last three weeks so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one thing and then maybe just I</p>
<p>did watch the video</p>
<p>I did watch the video it&rsquo;s just about</p>
<p>the numbers that the doctors make you</p>
<p>scared because they said oh it&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>high yeah 172.8 too high or is it okay</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two types of values there&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>one type of value in in Europe and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one in America and so</p>
<p>um personally I</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t here&rsquo;s the problem if I start</p>
<p>getting involved with uh</p>
<p>too many disagreements with your doctor</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to get in trouble so I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>going to say that um I would like you to</p>
<p>look up normal ranges and then just</p>
<p>determine for yourself</p>
<p>um so I don&rsquo;t create a another situation</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the thing that I would think</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know vitamin D is made from</p>
<p>cholesterol right so let&rsquo;s say you went</p>
<p>down to</p>
<p>um one of the tablets a day which is 10</p>
<p>000 I use which is a great maintenance</p>
<p>dose that&rsquo;s not toxic at all right and</p>
<p>so um the other thing too is that um</p>
<p>cholesterol</p>
<p>total cholesterol is really uh kind of a</p>
<p>false thing because when you measure</p>
<p>total cholesterol you&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>measuring</p>
<p>um but mainly the two lipoproteins which</p>
<p>is LDL and HDL and so you didn&rsquo;t mention</p>
<p>anything about those two but um let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say your LDL was High</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>177 so it is high</p>
<p>a 177 the LDL or total cholesterol</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>the LDL okay good</p>
<p>got it so this is what I would highly</p>
<p>recommend you do and your doctor might</p>
<p>not even do it so you got to find</p>
<p>someone to to do an advanced lipid</p>
<p>profile to look at there&rsquo;s two different</p>
<p>types of LDL one would be the small</p>
<p>dense lip uh small dense particle size</p>
<p>and the other one would be the large</p>
<p>buoyant and you just have to look at</p>
<p>which one do you have high and I would</p>
<p>bet you anything it&rsquo;s going to be the</p>
<p>large buoyant one which are</p>
<p>non-pathogenic it&rsquo;s not going to be in a</p>
<p>small dense one in which case</p>
<p>um even my wife Karen she we her LDL was</p>
<p>high we found that we did the advanced</p>
<p>lipid profile it&rsquo;s totally within the</p>
<p>normal range because in the ketogenic</p>
<p>diet you are eating more fat you are</p>
<p>losing more fat and with that comes more</p>
<p>fat mobilization and so there&rsquo;s no way</p>
<p>around it has to come out of your body</p>
<p>somehow</p>
<p>um you can always assist it by taking</p>
<p>more bile salts by the gallbladder</p>
<p>formula or maybe tutka but um right this</p>
<p>question keeps coming up over and over</p>
<p>over and over and I I have to keep kind</p>
<p>of emphasizing um</p>
<p>you know you can&rsquo;t just go by the LDL it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really give you the full picture</p>
<p>very good well folks you&rsquo;re feeling so</p>
<p>much better</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome the fact that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing so much better it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>I mean I&rsquo;ve had doctors even take one</p>
<p>step more and say well no we need to put</p>
<p>you in statins now and all of a sudden</p>
<p>the person just goes from feeling great</p>
<p>down to and they&rsquo;re on a high carb diet</p>
<p>low fat diet and they just I&rsquo;m like okay</p>
<p>so this is mainly why I drink on the</p>
<p>weekends and I&rsquo;m being very sarcastic</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not I don&rsquo;t drink on the weekends</p>
<p>thank you so much Susan we appreciate it</p>
<p>and of course love to hear back from you</p>
<p>as things develop and let&rsquo;s go real</p>
<p>quickly uh to Justin who&rsquo;s in Reading</p>
<p>California and Justin we&rsquo;re almost out</p>
<p>of time but uh make sure that you get on</p>
<p>the air you&rsquo;re on with Dr Berg go ahead</p>
<p>with your question</p>
<p>uh you&rsquo;re muted sir</p>
<p>hi great to meet you the reason I was</p>
<p>interested in talking to you is um I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>normally had great blood pressure my</p>
<p>whole life until last year and I&rsquo;d gone</p>
<p>to the doctor because I had this</p>
<p>complaint where</p>
<p>I was feeling light-headed after I ate</p>
<p>and I I talked to him and he really</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have an answer for me he said</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably something else and he</p>
<p>checked my blood pressure and it was 180</p>
<p>over 100 and he put me on a</p>
<p>variety of different drugs tried a few</p>
<p>different blood pressure meds and I</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t feeling terribly well during that</p>
<p>period</p>
<p>and I immediately started looking for</p>
<p>answers found you started working on a</p>
<p>keto diet</p>
<p>um went from 220 to about 197 now</p>
<p>uh Weight Wise and um</p>
<p>uh I&rsquo;d heard that perhaps this was</p>
<p>insulin related perhaps and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it just uh it blew me away that I&rsquo;d gone</p>
<p>from really good blood pressure to</p>
<p>within six months terrible blood</p>
<p>pressure</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m still losing weight but the you</p>
<p>know part of the discovery process was I</p>
<p>walked up the stairs and my heart was</p>
<p>racing 150 beats a minute</p>
<p>just out of nowhere and my whole body</p>
<p>was shaking and I just felt absolutely</p>
<p>terrible and</p>
<p>um and so I had several repeats I&rsquo;m on</p>
<p>the treadmill seven days a day oh a beak</p>
<p>for 30 minutes</p>
<p>and um it&rsquo;s started to recede and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening less frequently but I just I</p>
<p>get hit with these sudden episodes of</p>
<p>racing heart and so I thought I&rsquo;d ask</p>
<p>you to see if you had any uh input</p>
<p>yeah yeah I think um you know the most</p>
<p>likely cause of the high blood pressure</p>
<p>would be insulin because insulin makes</p>
<p>the arteries thicker and uh more rigid</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s other causes too uh like uh</p>
<p>for example uh low vitamin D levels can</p>
<p>raise the blood pressure and also low</p>
<p>potassium can also raise the blood</p>
<p>pressure which a lot of doctors are</p>
<p>recommending more potassium nowadays</p>
<p>because it softens up the arteries it</p>
<p>helps the kidney and it helps to lower</p>
<p>blood pressure especially if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to deal with the salt right so</p>
<p>um if you go too low in the salt it</p>
<p>throws everything off so what you do to</p>
<p>counter that is you increase the salt</p>
<p>with the potassium at the right ratios</p>
<p>two to one and then all of a sudden now</p>
<p>you have the the amount of blood that</p>
<p>you need so it&rsquo;s not a low volume and</p>
<p>then the heart doesn&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>compensate so it sounds like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something going on in that area also B1</p>
<p>deficiency uh can create those same</p>
<p>symptoms especially as a compensatory</p>
<p>like a heart thing which is right racing</p>
<p>to compensate because out of all the</p>
<p>areas of your body you have the most</p>
<p>mitochondria inside the heart and so you</p>
<p>need a lot of B to help the heart so I</p>
<p>would I would try a couple things but</p>
<p>not all together okay I would I would</p>
<p>check your blood pressure and your pulse</p>
<p>rate</p>
<p>um several times a day keeping a log and</p>
<p>for two days I would I would take like</p>
<p>B1 and see if that doesn&rsquo;t handle it and</p>
<p>the next two days I would take vitamin D</p>
<p>in the next two days I would take more</p>
<p>potassium to try to rule out what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on and then</p>
<p>um if that doesn&rsquo;t solve it come back</p>
<p>next week and uh because there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>other things you can do as well I I</p>
<p>think</p>
<p>I think this is uh related to one of</p>
<p>those three things so um we&rsquo;ll just have</p>
<p>to find out</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great okay Justin listen if you</p>
<p>would uh send a note to uh Dr Berg Dr</p>
<p>berg.com so we can make sure we get you</p>
<p>the link for next week or the week after</p>
<p>if it takes you that long to complete</p>
<p>your uh experimentation because we would</p>
<p>love to hear back from you and hope you</p>
<p>can get those uh kind of scary numbers</p>
<p>uh back in check that&rsquo;s terrific and</p>
<p>thank you for participating everyone in</p>
<p>the Green Room like like even Tech like</p>
<p>tachycardia high pulse rate</p>
<p>um if you&rsquo;re low in vitamin B1 which a</p>
<p>lot of people are and especially if you</p>
<p>start keto right and they connect you</p>
<p>need more B1 because of the need for a</p>
<p>higher amount of metabolism burning more</p>
<p>a different type of fuel so if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>take that B1 what happens is that uh</p>
<p>um the pulse rate can go up the blood</p>
<p>pressure can go up because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>compensating</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just you know you can do a lot of</p>
<p>testing to try to diagnose it expensive</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very cheap to just go out and</p>
<p>get some natural B1 to test it Waters</p>
<p>and like wow that helped me within a few</p>
<p>days so anyway</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to put some more videos on on</p>
<p>that I want to mention one a couple</p>
<p>things Steve before we go number one</p>
<p>um I completely redid uh my keto and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting membership site for</p>
<p>those of you that</p>
<p>um have used it before or are new to it</p>
<p>we completely redid it</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s awesome and there&rsquo;s two versions</p>
<p>one is to do it yourself the other is a</p>
<p>coaching version which we actually you</p>
<p>send in pictures of your meals and then</p>
<p>we critique them until it&rsquo;s correct so</p>
<p>we want you to do it long enough so it</p>
<p>becomes a new habit and um it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>basically we&rsquo;ll analyze your food your</p>
<p>meals so we do have a version of that to</p>
<p>help you with that and you just like</p>
<p>send in exactly what you eat and do that</p>
<p>long enough until you really understand</p>
<p>uh how to do this correctly and get the</p>
<p>benefits the key is doing a consistent</p>
<p>uh doing doing it correctly consistent</p>
<p>enough because a lot of people do it</p>
<p>incorrectly for a long period of time</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t work so we want to put</p>
<p>you get you on the right track so we</p>
<p>have that and the app and of course and</p>
<p>also you know we we also are shipping</p>
<p>our products overseas now too to make it</p>
<p>a little bit cheaper we&rsquo;ll put some</p>
<p>links down below but on that note oh by</p>
<p>the way Dr Burke I&rsquo;m sorry to interrupt</p>
<p>you but we do have the answers to our</p>
<p>last question which I didn&rsquo;t bring oh I</p>
<p>forgot about that that&rsquo;s all right so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s do it and that question asked true</p>
<p>false gerd heartburn and acid reflux are</p>
<p>a result of too much acid production and</p>
<p>95 percent of our respondents say that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not true five percent say it is true</p>
<p>well the 90 the the majority is is is</p>
<p>the correct group because</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s actually not an excess</p>
<p>production of acid it&rsquo;s the acid in the</p>
<p>wrong place the acid is an esophagus and</p>
<p>it shouldn&rsquo;t be there so there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>highly sophisticated machine in your</p>
<p>stomach where you have this acid that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in communication with the valve</p>
<p>on the top of that stomach and the way</p>
<p>it works is when you you need this</p>
<p>strong acid like you need that valve to</p>
<p>shut when you digest right when you</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re digesting meat and</p>
<p>things and so if you don&rsquo;t have enough</p>
<p>acid the valve&rsquo;s not going to shut it</p>
<p>comes right up into esophagus and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where you get the uh the problems and if</p>
<p>you you know you look this up and look</p>
<p>at what the cause of heartburn gerd acid</p>
<p>reflux is they&rsquo;ll say</p>
<p>oh it&rsquo;s the valve not closing</p>
<p>well that doesn&rsquo;t tell us anything but</p>
<p>what do we do if what&rsquo;s the real cause</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t get into that and then they</p>
<p>put you on medication or they might do</p>
<p>surgery which comes with a lot of side</p>
<p>effects so simple solution is to take</p>
<p>more um if you have those problems take</p>
<p>apple cider vinegar but you might say</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>what about it&rsquo;s a different type of acid</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not Hydrochloric well all we have</p>
<p>to do is we have to drop the acidity</p>
<p>level down to one to three</p>
<p>to then activate this whole process from</p>
<p>happening so you can do with different</p>
<p>types of acid doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have</p>
<p>to be Hydrochloric so anyway on that</p>
<p>note</p>
<p>um stay tuned for regular Friday morning</p>
<p>shows</p>
<p>um not going anywhere for a while so I</p>
<p>appreciate your wonderful attention and</p>
<p>the wonderful comments which I read</p>
<p>almost all of your comments on my videos</p>
<p>so I appreciate that and stay tuned for</p>
<p>some great content see you next week or</p>
<p>actually tomorrow morning</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>thank you</p>
