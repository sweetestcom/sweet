    <p>Our card this week is Kelly D. Wilson, the Ten of Spades from Ohio.</p>
<p>Kelly D. Wilson was a young woman whose life and career as a rising star on radio was tragically</p>
<p>cut short, with few clues left behind to piece together the mystery.</p>
<p>What happened to Kelly at the start of the new millennium shocked her fans, it horrified</p>
<p>her family, and it left detectives baffled to this very day.</p>
<p>Bringing her story to a wider audience might be the spark investigators need to kickstart</p>
<p>their work, and to bring whoever took her life to justice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>Monday, March 25, 2000 was the start of a new week at U92 Radio, also known as WROU</p>
<p>in Dayton, Ohio.</p>
<p>Just three months after worldwide Y2K, fears had calmed, and people in the entertainment</p>
<p>and broadcast industry realized the world was not going to end.</p>
<p>The vice president of the station, Stan Boston, spent most days buzzing around the office,</p>
<p>feeling really good about the channel&rsquo;s programming.</p>
<p>U92 was known as an R&amp;B station, so back then the channel played bands and artists like</p>
<p>Boyz II Men, Destiny&rsquo;s Child, and Missy Elliott, who were all topping the R&amp;B and</p>
<p>contemporary music charts.</p>
<p>And singers like Mariah Carey and J.Lo were helping blur the genre lines between pop and</p>
<p>R&amp;B.</p>
<p>And because DJs at Stan&rsquo;s station were also playing those artists all the time, the channel</p>
<p>just kept gaining more and more in popularity with listeners across Ohio.</p>
<p>Stan credited a lot of U92&rsquo;s recent success to one of his biggest disc jockeys, Nikki</p>
<p>Brooks.</p>
<p>Nikki was just an on-air name, though.</p>
<p>The real woman behind the name was 29-year-old Kelly D. Wilson.</p>
<p>Kelly hosted a weekday evening show called Jammin&rsquo; 8 at 8, and listeners loved her.</p>
<p>U92 had scooped up Kelly from a station in her nearby hometown of Cincinnati about a</p>
<p>year earlier.</p>
<p>And from the moment she hit the airwaves in Dayton, listeners tuned in regularly for any</p>
<p>programming she was a part of.</p>
<p>People were just drawn to Kelly&rsquo;s on-air energy and confident voice.</p>
<p>Fans could tell she genuinely loved her job and the music she played.</p>
<p>Kelly was dedicated to her work and building the station&rsquo;s branding around her DJ personality,</p>
<p>Nikki Brooks.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why Stan, her boss, was confused around 7pm on Monday when Kelly hadn&rsquo;t shown</p>
<p>up for her shift yet.</p>
<p>She was never late, and she usually got to the station right at 7 to prepare for her</p>
<p>show, which went on air at 8.</p>
<p>Now Stan didn&rsquo;t panic right away, he figured maybe she was just having car trouble or had</p>
<p>gotten stuck in traffic, so he waited.</p>
<p>But by 7.20, he really started to worry.</p>
<p>Tons of questions were swirling around in his mind.</p>
<p>Would Kelly have an unforeseen family emergency?</p>
<p>Why would she be flaking?</p>
<p>But no matter what, Stan knew the station would need to be prepared to fill her show&rsquo;s</p>
<p>airtime with, you know, a rerun, maybe a syndicated program, or worst case scenario, call in a</p>
<p>substitute host last minute to keep their programming going.</p>
<p>Stan looked up the phone number for Kelly&rsquo;s apartment landline and gave it a ring, but</p>
<p>no one answered.</p>
<p>Next, he called Kelly&rsquo;s mom, Charlene, who lived in Cincinnati.</p>
<p>He knew that Kelly was super close with her mom, and he figured she might know where her</p>
<p>daughter was, or at least be able to explain why Kelly had just ghosted her shift.</p>
<p>But when Charlene answered, she told Stan that she had no clue where Kelly was, or why</p>
<p>she failed to show up to work.</p>
<p>She also said that Stan&rsquo;s call made her very worried, because she&rsquo;d actually been trying</p>
<p>to call Kelly the day before on Sunday, but hadn&rsquo;t been able to reach her.</p>
<p>Stan tried to keep Charlene calm and said, you know what, I&rsquo;ll just go over to Kelly&rsquo;s</p>
<p>apartment to check on her.</p>
<p>This was actually no big deal for Stan, because coincidentally, he lived in the same apartment</p>
<p>complex as Kelly and knew exactly where her unit was.</p>
<p>The community they lived in was called The Meadows, and it was in a part of the city</p>
<p>known as Harrison Township.</p>
<p>The Meadows complex is still there today, and it&rsquo;s one of those apartment building</p>
<p>layouts where there&rsquo;s several residential buildings sprawled around a pool with an office</p>
<p>and a clubhouse, which are sort of the hub of everything.</p>
<p>And it also has an on-site bar and social hub.</p>
<p>When Stan drove over to Kelly&rsquo;s place after talking with Charlene, he arrived by like</p>
<p>7.30pm.</p>
<p>And the first thing he saw was her car parked in its space, which he thought was kind of</p>
<p>weird because that seemed to indicate that Kelly was home for some reason and just had</p>
<p>not been answering her phone.</p>
<p>He went up to the door, jiggled the knob, and realized it was locked.</p>
<p>So he knocked a few times, but Kelly didn&rsquo;t answer.</p>
<p>And there weren&rsquo;t any sounds coming from inside that indicated she was making her way</p>
<p>to the door or anything.</p>
<p>Stan went to the front office, but no one was there working, so he decided that his</p>
<p>only other option to try and get someone on staff to help him was to go to the on-site</p>
<p>bar and see if the bartender could get a hold of someone.</p>
<p>The bartender called a maintenance man who agreed to come over, but he said there was</p>
<p>no way he was going to be able to just let Stan waltz into Kelly&rsquo;s unit and look around.</p>
<p>That would be way against policy.</p>
<p>Stan explained to the bartender and maintenance guy that he and Kelly&rsquo;s family were really</p>
<p>worried about her because no one had heard from her in two days.</p>
<p>So they came to a compromise.</p>
<p>In order not to break their company policy and just let Stan take a peek, the staff ended</p>
<p>up calling the police, who offered to come by and do a welfare check at Kelly&rsquo;s unit.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, a Montgomery County Sheriff&rsquo;s deputy named Johnny Campbell heard the call</p>
<p>come in over his patrol car&rsquo;s radio, and he headed over.</p>
<p>Just like when Stan had knocked on Kelly&rsquo;s door, when Deputy Campbell rapped on it a</p>
<p>few times, no one answered.</p>
<p>So he used the maintenance man&rsquo;s key to open the door and go inside.</p>
<p>To help explain what happened next, our team went to Dayton and interviewed Montgomery</p>
<p>County Sheriff&rsquo;s detective Melanie Phelps.</p>
<p>Detective Phelps is currently in charge of Kelly&rsquo;s case, and sometimes you&rsquo;ll hear her</p>
<p>switch between calling Kelly by her real name and her on-air name, Nikki, throughout this</p>
<p>episode.</p>
<p>He let himself in with a key and announced, you know, Sheriff&rsquo;s office, you know, is anybody</p>
<p>here?</p>
<p>Sheriff&rsquo;s office, anybody here?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a very big apartment.</p>
<p>So as he went through, he then located Kelly on the floor, deceased, and made sure that</p>
<p>everybody got, you know, stayed out, secured the scene, and called the supervisors and</p>
<p>the detectives.</p>
<p>According to what Phelps knows from reading through the case file, Kelly lived in a one-bedroom</p>
<p>apartment, and her living room, dining room, and kitchen were all in an open floor plan.</p>
<p>There weren&rsquo;t walls separating those rooms.</p>
<p>But to access the bathroom, you had to actually walk through Kelly&rsquo;s bedroom, and that is</p>
<p>where Deputy Campbell found Kelly&rsquo;s body, about halfway off the side of her bathtub.</p>
<p>She was laying on her stomach in the bathroom, and she had on just a robe and a bra and a</p>
<p>t-shirt.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t have anything on below the waist.</p>
<p>According to crime scene reports filed at the time, there wasn&rsquo;t much blood on or around</p>
<p>Kelly&rsquo;s body, so it wasn&rsquo;t immediately clear to the police how she died.</p>
<p>But one detail the investigators noticed right away was fecal matter.</p>
<p>It was on Kelly, it was around the bathroom, and back in her bedroom on her bed.</p>
<p>Now, fecal matter being in the bathroom itself wasn&rsquo;t super strange, I mean, it&rsquo;s a bathroom</p>
<p>after all.</p>
<p>But the fact that it was also found on the bed indicated to authorities that they may</p>
<p>have been looking at a scenario where Kelly had originally been killed on her bed, then</p>
<p>fecal matter from either her or her killer became present there, and then she was moved</p>
<p>to her bathroom.</p>
<p>They also had to consider the possibility, too, that the fecal matter may have originated</p>
<p>in the bathroom, and then the killer left traces of it in the bedroom post-crime.</p>
<p>The sequence of events couldn&rsquo;t be determined for sure just by where the matter was found,</p>
<p>but it gave police the ability to theorize.</p>
<p>Another glaring clue police found near Kelly&rsquo;s body were residues from cleaning supplies,</p>
<p>which appeared to be an attempt by someone to cover up the crime.</p>
<p>During her interview with us, Detective Phelps wouldn&rsquo;t say specifically what kind of cleaning</p>
<p>products had been used, but she said it was likely something Kelly had under her sink</p>
<p>and not a chemical that the killer had brought with them to the scene.</p>
<p>We just know there was cleanup at the scene, or attempted cleanup at the scene.</p>
<p>After discovering Kelly&rsquo;s body, detectives collected some of her clothes and other items</p>
<p>from her room and bathroom as evidence, and were able to lift fingerprints from surfaces</p>
<p>in those areas.</p>
<p>One of the big things that puzzled investigators was that there seemed to be no signs of forced</p>
<p>entry, or like a break-in, no broken windows, no damaged locks, nothing.</p>
<p>The absence of those things caused police to think two things.</p>
<p>Either the killer had a key to get in, or Kelly willingly let them in.</p>
<p>And nowhere in the apartment had things been viciously tossed around or turned over.</p>
<p>But there were a few little things that authorities had a hard time deciphering the meaning of.</p>
<p>It was definitely not ransacked.</p>
<p>There was one cupboard door that was open.</p>
<p>Her purse was on the counter in the kitchen, and it looked as though somebody had picked</p>
<p>her purse up and kind of shaken it, because there were coins that had gone on the counter</p>
<p>and on the floor.</p>
<p>She had a very tall jewelry armoire, and that was not opened.</p>
<p>She still was wearing jewelry, so I don&rsquo;t believe it had anything to do with robbery.</p>
<p>Nothing seemed to be missing of value from the apartment.</p>
<p>When Stan and another radio station employee who joined him at the scene were told Kelly</p>
<p>was dead, they were shocked by the news.</p>
<p>They confirmed for investigators by looking at a photo that it was in fact Kelly who had</p>
<p>been found in the apartment.</p>
<p>So pretty much from hour one of the investigation, detectives never had a question about who</p>
<p>their victim was.</p>
<p>But they did have a bizarre mystery to unravel about how she died.</p>
<p>While this was all happening, Kelly&rsquo;s mom Charlene sent her son Craig up to Dayton from</p>
<p>Cincinnati to see what was going on with Kelly.</p>
<p>Cincinnati is only about a half hour south of Dayton, so it didn&rsquo;t take Craig long to</p>
<p>get there.</p>
<p>And when he got to Kelly&rsquo;s apartment building, he saw police everywhere and quickly learned</p>
<p>that his sister was gone.</p>
<p>He went back to Cincinnati and had to break the heart-wrenching news to his family.</p>
<p>I think it was probably hard.</p>
<p>Her mom was probably hard for her because her baby now had, you know, it wasn&rsquo;t super</p>
<p>far away, but her daughter was, you know, had her own place now and had moved up there</p>
<p>for a new job and it was kind of exciting.</p>
<p>So, you know, she just wanted to make sure that her baby girl was going to be okay.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take long before the news of Kelly&rsquo;s death spread through the community and people</p>
<p>who were avid listeners of her radio program began to publicly mourn her loss alongside</p>
<p>her loved ones.</p>
<p>Fans in Dayton idolized Kelly.</p>
<p>And according to Detective Phelps, the crime affected hundreds, even thousands of people</p>
<p>who felt like they had a personal connection with her, even though they maybe just listened</p>
<p>to her over the radio for a few hours a day.</p>
<p>So back then, the radio celebrities were actually like a celebrity here in Dayton.</p>
<p>And people would, it was like they would see an actress or something.</p>
<p>If you were out and about and somebody that you said, oh, it&rsquo;s so-and-so, it&rsquo;s so-and-so,</p>
<p>it was like building them up or they were on some kind of pedestal or something.</p>
<p>So it was very high end to be that well-known on the radio here in Dayton at the time.</p>
<p>The day after Kelly&rsquo;s body was discovered, 92.1FM got flooded with phone calls from fans</p>
<p>who wanted to share their grief.</p>
<p>Other show hosts sat in on Kelly&rsquo;s show and dedicated it to her, playing calls from</p>
<p>fans and airing songs that they knew Kelly liked.</p>
<p>Listeners could hear her co-workers choking up on air as they played One Sweet Day by</p>
<p>Mariah Carey in honor of Kelly.</p>
<p>It would take some time before the coroner in Montgomery County would have the results</p>
<p>of Kelly&rsquo;s autopsy.</p>
<p>So during the first 24 to 48 hours of the investigation, they couldn&rsquo;t technically</p>
<p>call her death a murder.</p>
<p>But in their hearts, just due to the certain factors that they&rsquo;d observed at the crime</p>
<p>scene, they knew that they were dealing with a highly suspicious death, which more than</p>
<p>likely would end up being a homicide.</p>
<p>The first thing detectives started to do to get a better idea of what Kelly had been doing</p>
<p>the weekend she died or who&rsquo;d last seen her was to check her work records and interview</p>
<p>her friends and family.</p>
<p>They learned that Kelly had for sure gone to work on Friday, March 24th, and she had</p>
<p>hosted her R&amp;B show Jammin&rsquo; 8 at 8 until midnight.</p>
<p>You tell me, loud and proud, what station is your radio always locked on?</p>
<p>We have no radio!</p>
<p>Nothing out of the ordinary happened while Kelly was at work on Friday.</p>
<p>As for Saturday, according to a man detectives tracked down who&rsquo;d been casually dating Kelly</p>
<p>at the time, he said that he&rsquo;d been over at her apartment that night to have a few</p>
<p>drinks with her and one of his buddies.</p>
<p>After drinks, he said the group left Kelly&rsquo;s place and went to a party at a woman named</p>
<p>Tammy&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Tammy was a co-worker of Kelly&rsquo;s and people who attended that house party were mostly</p>
<p>employees of the radio station and their friends.</p>
<p>According to several witnesses who were there and two guys who&rsquo;d arrived with her, Kelly&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fun at the party didn&rsquo;t last long.</p>
<p>She was not there very long.</p>
<p>She showed up with two individuals and they kind of hung out at the party.</p>
<p>Apparently she had been drinking prior to going to the party and the two guys went downstairs</p>
<p>into the basement and they were watching some football or sports.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what they were watching.</p>
<p>And then I guess she maybe became a little too intoxicated and so they decided that they</p>
<p>were going to take her home.</p>
<p>So she didn&rsquo;t want to go home at first, but they were kind of like, you know, we really</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to be here any longer.</p>
<p>So they went ahead and took her on back to her apartment.</p>
<p>According to police reports, it was at about 11 p.m. when the two men said that they left</p>
<p>Tammy&rsquo;s and drove Kelly back to her apartment.</p>
<p>After that, these two guys told police that they decided to hit up some bars.</p>
<p>The bars they wanted to go to were fairly close to Kelly&rsquo;s apartment.</p>
<p>So for them, it was an easy decision to just drop her off and then head out for more drinks</p>
<p>on their own.</p>
<p>Back in 2000, the two popular nightclubs nearby were Tiffany&rsquo;s and then another dive called</p>
<p>Frogs.</p>
<p>Both of these places were known for late night dancing, drinks, and music.</p>
<p>They first went to Tiffany&rsquo;s and when they arrived, they ran into Tammy, Kelly&rsquo;s co-worker</p>
<p>who&rsquo;d thrown the house party.</p>
<p>By that time, the house party had moved to the clubs and guests were bouncing between</p>
<p>Tiffany&rsquo;s and Frogs.</p>
<p>According to Tammy&rsquo;s statement to police, when she saw the two guys who&rsquo;d been with</p>
<p>Kelly, she checked in with them to find out if Kelly had said anything about maybe sobering</p>
<p>up some and trying to come back out to join the group.</p>
<p>That was a coincidence.</p>
<p>When the girl who threw the house party said, oh, is Nikki here with you?</p>
<p>It was very loud in the club and he was like, she&rsquo;s not here.</p>
<p>And then kind of kept walking.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have much interaction other than the fact that he mentioned, no, she was not</p>
<p>with them.</p>
<p>Sometime after midnight, after Tammy talked to the guys at the bar, Kelly started blowing</p>
<p>up Tammy&rsquo;s pager.</p>
<p>Data from Tammy&rsquo;s pager showed that Kelly paged her several times using the landline</p>
<p>at her apartment.</p>
<p>Tammy told police that she had used a phone at one of the clubs to call Kelly.</p>
<p>When Kelly picked up, she insisted that Tammy or one of the men she&rsquo;d been hanging out</p>
<p>with earlier come back to her apartment and get her because she wanted to keep partying.</p>
<p>Tammy said she didn&rsquo;t feel super comfortable with sending those guys back to get Kelly</p>
<p>because she didn&rsquo;t know them all that well.</p>
<p>She had spoken to Kelly around the same time that she saw those two gentlemen at the club.</p>
<p>So she said she had been a little leery of the two individuals because she didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>who they were.</p>
<p>But when she saw them out and talked to Nikki, she felt better because, oh, OK, I know that</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s home and I know they&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>Police were faced with a big gap in their timeline.</p>
<p>As far as they knew, the last people to physically see Kelly were the two guys who dropped her</p>
<p>off at home at around 11 p.m.</p>
<p>But the last person to actually talk to Kelly was Tammy.</p>
<p>The detectives at the time start talking to all of her friends and trying to make a timeline.</p>
<p>Who was the last person that saw her?</p>
<p>What did she do?</p>
<p>How intoxicated was she?</p>
<p>Did she see anybody else after she got home from the party?</p>
<p>Really something else happened.</p>
<p>What that something else was, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem as though anyone knows exactly who stopped by or would have gone to her house</p>
<p>or if she let somebody in.</p>
<p>Based on everyone they talked to, detectives learned that Kelly was a welcoming person,</p>
<p>especially to people she knew.</p>
<p>Everyone just says that everybody loved her.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know why anybody would have hurt her.</p>
<p>She was up and coming and very social and she was friends with everybody.</p>
<p>So she wouldn&rsquo;t have been like, no, you can&rsquo;t come over or something along those lines.</p>
<p>She would have, probably anyone that she actually knew would have let into the apartment.</p>
<p>When detectives inventoried the evidence they&rsquo;d processed from the crime scene, they realized</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d never found Kelly&rsquo;s keys in her apartment.</p>
<p>That only reinforced investigators&rsquo; theory that whoever killed Kelly had taken her keys</p>
<p>with them when they&rsquo;d left the crime scene.</p>
<p>The door was locked.</p>
<p>There was no forced entry.</p>
<p>So that individual somehow relocked the door.</p>
<p>Now, her keys were not located, but you couldn&rsquo;t lock it from the inside and pull it shut.</p>
<p>So it had to be locked from the outside.</p>
<p>That says that she knew who it was.</p>
<p>She let them into the apartment.</p>
<p>By late Monday night into Tuesday morning, police had assembled a fairly clear picture</p>
<p>of what Kelly&rsquo;s weekend had looked like leading up to Sunday morning.</p>
<p>But they still felt like they needed to get more from the two men she&rsquo;d been with before</p>
<p>and after leaving Tammy&rsquo;s house party.</p>
<p>Now, police knew from talking with Tammy that the guys had been at Tiffany&rsquo;s club late into</p>
<p>the night Saturday and early Sunday morning.</p>
<p>And Tammy herself knew that Kelly was alive and well when she talked to her shortly after</p>
<p>midnight.</p>
<p>So the men clearly had alibis for the hours of 11 p.m. to roughly 1230 a.m.</p>
<p>But investigators needed to pin down their whereabouts for after that point in time.</p>
<p>According to Detective Phelps, law enforcement&rsquo;s thinking at the time was that when these men</p>
<p>dropped Kelly off, either they or Kelly had access to her keys to get inside her apartment.</p>
<p>What they had to figure out is if either the men had kept Kelly&rsquo;s keys or perhaps remembered</p>
<p>anyone else lurking around the unit when they left her.</p>
<p>She kind of had known everybody from about the same amount of time, but the people from</p>
<p>the party had never seen those two individuals before.</p>
<p>So they right away were thinking, OK, there&rsquo;s two guys we&rsquo;ve never seen before, so this</p>
<p>is a little shady.</p>
<p>So, of course, that they were two that they wanted to talk to right away.</p>
<p>Both men, one of which, again, was someone Kelly was sort of dating at the time, agreed</p>
<p>to cooperate with the authorities and answer whatever questions they could.</p>
<p>They both admitted once again that they were with Kelly before, during and after the house</p>
<p>party.</p>
<p>The men insisted that when they dropped Kelly off at her apartment shortly after 11 p.m.</p>
<p>on Saturday, she was very much alive.</p>
<p>The guy who had kind of been dating Kelly at the time, who we&rsquo;re going to call Joe,</p>
<p>said that earlier on Saturday, he and Kelly had consensual sex before being joined by</p>
<p>his friend to hang out.</p>
<p>To police, Joe seemed genuinely distraught when he learned Kelly had been killed, and</p>
<p>he even reached out to Kelly&rsquo;s mom saying how sorry he was for her loss.</p>
<p>He said even though he&rsquo;d only gotten to know Kelly for a short period of time, he really</p>
<p>liked her.</p>
<p>Joe and his buddy were both able to provide police with solid alibis for early Sunday</p>
<p>morning.</p>
<p>They told detectives that after they dropped Kelly off and went back out to the clubs,</p>
<p>they each ended up going home with other girls.</p>
<p>When investigators interviewed those women to corroborate the men&rsquo;s stories, the women</p>
<p>vouched for them.</p>
<p>So that was kind of the end of that as far as looking at them as suspects.</p>
<p>With not much else to go on, when the results of Kelly&rsquo;s autopsy came in, it was a welcome</p>
<p>bit of information for investigators in order to keep the case from stalling.</p>
<p>The Montgomery County coroner had examined Kelly&rsquo;s body and found some critical clues</p>
<p>that allowed detectives to finally label Kelly&rsquo;s death a homicide.</p>
<p>And they noticed several blunt force trauma injuries.</p>
<p>Now it was not anything horrific, it wasn&rsquo;t any kind of bloody scene or anything along</p>
<p>those lines.</p>
<p>But they make note of every little mark that is on her, all of the different cuts or whatever</p>
<p>inside her mouth.</p>
<p>She had bitten the inside of her cheek and had some injuries on her face, like the side</p>
<p>of her mouth.</p>
<p>She had a little bruise on the side of her temple.</p>
<p>And you could see on the back of her neck, there were some red marks and a little bit</p>
<p>of bruising on her neck as well.</p>
<p>The consensus between the pathologist and police was that more than likely Kelly&rsquo;s</p>
<p>killer had strangled her to death sometime Sunday morning.</p>
<p>But as far as what time, they weren&rsquo;t exactly sure.</p>
<p>Investigators believe the killer used his bare hands because there was no bruising or</p>
<p>ligature marks on Kelly&rsquo;s neck that indicated a rope or any kind of binding had been used.</p>
<p>Something particularly frustrating was that the coroner was unable to determine if Kelly</p>
<p>had been sexually assaulted before she was murdered.</p>
<p>Now authorities knew based on what Joe had told them that he and Kelly had had sex at</p>
<p>some point in the 24 hours before she was killed.</p>
<p>But based on the autopsy findings, there was no way to tell for sure if she&rsquo;d been</p>
<p>sexually assaulted at the time of her murder.</p>
<p>And Detective Phelps said she couldn&rsquo;t provide any information about that to protect the</p>
<p>integrity of the act of investigation.</p>
<p>In the end, the coroner listed Kelly&rsquo;s official manner of death as homicide, with a cause</p>
<p>of death as asphyxiation.</p>
<p>When officials confirmed Kelly&rsquo;s death was in fact a murder, it sent another ripple of</p>
<p>shock and fear through the Dayton community.</p>
<p>It also ratcheted up the pressure on police to identify and arrest whoever was responsible</p>
<p>because people in the area were terrified that a monster was out there, on the loose,</p>
<p>able to strike again if they wanted.</p>
<p>On Saturday, April 1st, six days after Kelly was killed, her friends and family held a</p>
<p>memorial service for her at Omega Baptist Church in Dayton.</p>
<p>150 people showed up to share stories and memories of Kelly.</p>
<p>According to an article in the Dayton Daily News, the radio station president was there</p>
<p>and talked about how Kelly had a natural ability to connect with listeners.</p>
<p>You could hear her smile through the radio, she said.</p>
<p>Another coworker told a story about how when she&rsquo;d first started, Kelly had to tape the</p>
<p>name Nikki Brooks near her microphone in the studio so she would remember her tag out.</p>
<p>She had gone by a different on-air name in Cincinnati, so she didn&rsquo;t want to slip up</p>
<p>and accidentally use her old moniker.</p>
<p>Detectives spent the rest of that year collecting DNA samples from people who were with Kelly</p>
<p>prior to her death, most of which consented to giving swabs for investigative purposes.</p>
<p>They wanted to compare those individuals&rsquo; genetic profiles to items of evidence from</p>
<p>the crime scene, specifically Kelly&rsquo;s robe, t-shirt, and the bra she was wearing.</p>
<p>Detective Phelps said the results from the comparison testing on DNA samples taken at</p>
<p>the time didn&rsquo;t point to anyone they didn&rsquo;t already know had been in Kelly&rsquo;s apartment.</p>
<p>In other words, there were no unknown DNA profiles found on the items.</p>
<p>There were also no DNA profiles of known suspects whose DNA was in a place it shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have been, like in blood, for example.</p>
<p>Phelps couldn&rsquo;t provide our team with additional information she had regarding the DNA, like</p>
<p>if the fecal matter came back to someone else other than Kelly.</p>
<p>And you can spiral on this one all day.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>I went around and around thinking about what it would mean if it were Kelly&rsquo;s, or more</p>
<p>what it would mean if it wasn&rsquo;t since no unknown DNA was found.</p>
<p>But the truth is, only the investigators know.</p>
<p>In order to keep things moving at the time without much forensic evidence to work off</p>
<p>of, police had to rely on tips from the community.</p>
<p>They worked a handful of leads that came in from people calling saying stuff like, so</p>
<p>and so was acting weird when someone brought up Kelly&rsquo;s murder, and just other general</p>
<p>community rumors.</p>
<p>But by the start of 2001, nothing had materialized.</p>
<p>Police couldn&rsquo;t find anyone who disliked her or had any problems with her.</p>
<p>So without suspects or a motive, the case stalled.</p>
<p>The Montgomery County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office preserved evidence in storage, and detectives</p>
<p>continued to investigate.</p>
<p>But not much happened with the case until 2004.</p>
<p>That year, a tip led police to get a search warrant for a man&rsquo;s DNA in Georgia.</p>
<p>Sheriff&rsquo;s detectives had never publicly said what information specifically led them</p>
<p>to pursue this warrant, or even who the man was.</p>
<p>But in the end, investigators compared his profile to their evidence and didn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>a match.</p>
<p>After that fizzled out, a lot of the people in Dayton who were still hoping the case would</p>
<p>regain traction, began speculating that perhaps Kelly had fallen victim to someone who had</p>
<p>been a little too big of a fan of her on her radio show, essentially a stalker.</p>
<p>Some of her co-workers said, you know, she was very friendly and there were people that</p>
<p>flirted with her a lot because she&rsquo;s absolutely beautiful.</p>
<p>So nothing that seemed out of the ordinary or extreme.</p>
<p>So she hadn&rsquo;t made any like complaints to police about any particular person?</p>
<p>No, she had not.</p>
<p>The stalker theory never really took hold with investigators because they felt strongly</p>
<p>that whoever had attacked and killed Kelly actually knew her, or at the very least had</p>
<p>been familiar enough to her that she would have let them into her apartment dressed only</p>
<p>in her robe, a bra and a t-shirt.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t have anything on below the waist when she was found.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t know, based on what police have shared with us, whether or not they think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s because Kelly had been partially undressed by her killer, or if she&rsquo;d been</p>
<p>in that state prior to her murder.</p>
<p>But the fact remained, she was clearly in a comfortable state of dress when whoever</p>
<p>killed her got inside her apartment.</p>
<p>The next update in the case didn&rsquo;t come until 2006, when a sheriff&rsquo;s office detective</p>
<p>told the Dayton Daily News that there was a quote, real big lead in the case.</p>
<p>But he wouldn&rsquo;t provide specifics.</p>
<p>Kelly&rsquo;s mom Charlene was interviewed for that same story and told the reporter that</p>
<p>She just wanted to know who killed her daughter and why.</p>
<p>According to Detective Phelps, despite the hype around that announcement, nothing significant</p>
<p>developed in the case over the next several years.</p>
<p>It was in 2012 that Detective Phelps decided to start investigating Kelly&rsquo;s murder in</p>
<p>her spare time, and she immediately felt a sense of burden to take it on full time.</p>
<p>One of our other detectives had been talking about the case, and I was like, oh, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very interesting.</p>
<p>When I was a beat cop, just in Harrison, that was in my beat, and then that was my beat</p>
<p>when I was a detective.</p>
<p>So it was my area, I&rsquo;m very familiar with it, and I just think you can&rsquo;t give up on</p>
<p>these kinds of cases.</p>
<p>Families need closure.</p>
<p>So whenever I could sneak one of the cases out and start looking into it and taking some</p>
<p>notes and becoming more involved, I would anytime I could.</p>
<p>Sometimes I love to go through and look at pictures over and over again.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been several other cases that I&rsquo;ve worked that after looking at the pictures</p>
<p>for the 50th time, I&rsquo;ll notice something that I never noticed before.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;ll go, oh, oh, I&rsquo;m going to have that sent to the lab.</p>
<p>So then I&rsquo;ll get back out and have evidence technicians send that over to the lab.</p>
<p>So I go over them and over them and over them until I really get every last little speck</p>
<p>of the picture in my head.</p>
<p>In recent years, Detective Phelps has sent old DNA samples to undergo newer, more targeted</p>
<p>testing with the hopes that her department can get a match on some DNA found on Kelly&rsquo;s</p>
<p>clothing.</p>
<p>If a DNA match doesn&rsquo;t come back, Detective Phelps said it will take a tip from someone</p>
<p>who saw something noteworthy in Kelly&rsquo;s apartment complex the night of the crime to</p>
<p>help law enforcement solve the case.</p>
<p>Even though a long shot like that seems like a pipe dream, Phelps hasn&rsquo;t lost hope that</p>
<p>just one small detail could change everything, even 22 years later.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re hoping maybe somebody saw something in the parking lot or, I mean,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re big buildings over there.</p>
<p>You know, maybe a neighbor thought, oh, I heard something and I looked out and I saw,</p>
<p>you know, somebody, you know, get into a blue car or something along those lines.</p>
<p>Just a little bit of something more is kind of what we&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>Any viable suspects?</p>
<p>There are.</p>
<p>However, I think that we need to rely on some more technology because we didn&rsquo;t have it</p>
<p>as well back in 2000.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always new technology coming out.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m always resending things to the lab to try to be tested, you know, again and again</p>
<p>and again, or try a different method or something along those lines to just try to spark a new</p>
<p>lead.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s totally solvable.</p>
<p>I have every faith in this one and I think it&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>I really do.</p>
<p>I think that somebody somewhere is going to say, you know what, I remember she used to</p>
<p>live next door to me or she used to live, you know, here.</p>
<p>And I remember when that happened and this guy was being weird or something, you know.</p>
<p>Though they can&rsquo;t say for sure, police lean toward believing that the suspect is a man</p>
<p>because the case lacks any other strong motive, meaning it was likely sexual.</p>
<p>The hardest thing for Phelps is knowing that year after year, Kelly&rsquo;s family has endured</p>
<p>continual heartbreak over losing Kelly and has never had any answers surrounding the</p>
<p>circumstances that led to her murder.</p>
<p>In 2017, Dayton TV station WHIO interviewed Kelly&rsquo;s sister Jamie Powell.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a clip of what she had to say regarding what a hole Kelly&rsquo;s absence has left in</p>
<p>her life.</p>
<p>Thinking what may have become of her, you know, she would have saw my children grow</p>
<p>up and how much she would have adored them and the new grandbaby.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s when it really hits home that nothing&rsquo;s been solved, nothing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still like an open wound.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why Detective Phelps keeps pushing, keeps trying, keeps turning over every leaf</p>
<p>in the case.</p>
<p>She realizes the deafening silence and dead ends that surround Kelly&rsquo;s case is just</p>
<p>too much to bear for her family.</p>
<p>I mean, if that was my daughter, if that was my sister, then I would want somebody to keep</p>
<p>trying.</p>
<p>So I just kind of always look at it that way.</p>
<p>Somebody&rsquo;s crying, somebody&rsquo;s upset, somebody lost a loved one.</p>
<p>How can you just go, eh, oh well, it seems hard.</p>
<p>So I mean, you just got to keep trying.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it going to hurt to keep trying?</p>
<p>One thing Phelps and the other investigators who have worked this case continually grapple</p>
<p>with is the fact that Kelly was home alone.</p>
<p>It was late, she&rsquo;d been drinking and was in her bathrobe.</p>
<p>All of those things tell police that Kelly was comfortable when her killer came over.</p>
<p>The fact that the door was locked meant whoever had killed her took the time to manually</p>
<p>lock the door as they were leaving.</p>
<p>Because Detective Phelps says that Kelly had one of those locks that you can&rsquo;t just easily</p>
<p>lock from the inside before leaving.</p>
<p>Like you couldn&rsquo;t lock it before shutting it and then leave.</p>
<p>You had to shut it and then put a key in the knob and turn the lock once you were outside.</p>
<p>So was her killer someone she knew?</p>
<p>Someone she felt so comfortable around that she would let them into her apartment after</p>
<p>midnight while wearing her bathrobe?</p>
<p>Or did someone have a key to her apartment?</p>
<p>Police said they cleared the maintenance employees of the apartment complex early on</p>
<p>in the investigation, so it&rsquo;s unlikely the killer was a worker at the Meadows.</p>
<p>Police believe that whoever killed Kelly took her keys, locked her apartment door on their</p>
<p>way out, and that person still has her keys, or they could have disposed of them after</p>
<p>the murder.</p>
<p>The tough thing about this case is that finding the answers to all of those questions hasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>been easy, and it may never be easy, especially because challenges always present themselves</p>
<p>as more and more time passes.</p>
<p>For example, when our team was on the ground reporting in Dayton for this episode, our</p>
<p>reporter had a hard time even finding clips of Kelly&rsquo;s old radio shows.</p>
<p>We wanted to share more of her voice with you, but the station that she worked for was</p>
<p>purchased by a different media company in 2004, and executives there told us that shows</p>
<p>prior to 2004 were wiped from the archive.</p>
<p>That little bit of audio that we could get of her was from an archived news package for</p>
<p>WHIO that just happened to have a snippet of Kelly&rsquo;s voice as a DJ in it.</p>
<p>Despite Kelly having one of the most popular voices on radio in Dayton at one time, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sad there&rsquo;s nothing out there commemorating her legacy as a budding radio star and a beloved</p>
<p>young woman in the Dayton community.</p>
