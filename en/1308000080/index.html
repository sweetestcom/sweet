    <p>Is there going to be an open mic night in&hellip;</p>
<p>We were going to have you speak, Friedberg, but we realized you&rsquo;re not capable, so&hellip;</p>
<p>We want the show to be entertaining.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not personable, Friedberg.</p>
<p>You guys are missing out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you guys what makes my stand-up comedy so good.</p>
<p>Oh God, here we go.</p>
<p>Oh my God, we&rsquo;re back on this. Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my creative sensibility. So if I have some time to prep</p>
<p>and write my script and read my own creative insights&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, bring one joke next week.</p>
<p>J. Cal, for all the time we&rsquo;ve spent together on this podcast,</p>
<p>you know so little about me. It&rsquo;s so depressing, I got to be honest.</p>
<p>Well, you know, here&rsquo;s the thing about friendship.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a two-way street, you got to open up a little bit.</p>
<p>We got to go out and get drunk one night.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I just want to give a shout out to this guy, Andrew Lacey.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Shout out.</p>
<p>He is the CEO of a company called PreNuvo.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Can you just flash it on the screen?</p>
<p>PreNuvo.</p>
<p>I went to PreNuvo and what they do is they do a head-to-toe MRI scan in 45 minutes</p>
<p>and they use a bunch of machine learning and image recognition</p>
<p>to help a radiologist interpret these MRIs in real time beside you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a service that you have to pay a few thousand dollars for.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a location in Silicon Valley in Redwood City and a couple of others</p>
<p>and we mentioned it.</p>
<p>But the reason I&rsquo;m bringing this up is he sent me an email yesterday</p>
<p>and he said, I just want to thank you and the besties for mentioning PreNuvo</p>
<p>because we had a bunch of people come and he said,</p>
<p>we found no less than 11 life-saving diagnoses.</p>
<p>11.</p>
<p>11 people.</p>
<p>11 individuals listening to the pod.</p>
<p>Pod saves lives.</p>
<p>Went to PreNuvo after hearing about it, had a head-to-toe MRI,</p>
<p>found all kinds of issues from a brain tumor and brain cancer</p>
<p>to stomach cancer and other things and was able to get the care that they needed.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>Anyways, I just want to give a shout out to him for doing a lot of really important work</p>
<p>and for the folks that are listening that have some money set aside and can afford to do this,</p>
<p>I would just really encourage you.</p>
<p>We have no financial stake in it, nothing other than we are users of it.</p>
<p>But check out PreNuvo.com and shout out to Andrew and his team there.</p>
<p>Okay, here we go.</p>
<p>Three, two, let&rsquo;s start the show.</p>
<p>The war in Ukraine has him insane in the membrane and Biden&rsquo;s new disinformation council</p>
<p>is going to have him detained.</p>
<p>To calm him down from tanking Solana, he started smoking that marijuana.</p>
<p>You know him as the rain man.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s here again.</p>
<p>David Sachs.</p>
<p>How you doing?</p>
<p>Have a good week?</p>
<p>Yeah, not bad.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Big energy this week, huh?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>In high school, he had no friends, but thanks to the pod, undergrads are in his DMs.</p>
<p>All forms of steak.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a Persian.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the vanguard of all the virgins.</p>
<p>The queen of quinoa.</p>
<p>The sultan of science, David Friedberg.</p>
<p>Wait, I missed like half of that because Tremont was laughing so hard.</p>
<p>I can do it again.</p>
<p>Do it again.</p>
<p>Do it again.</p>
<p>Let me try from the top.</p>
<p>In high school, he had no friends, but thanks to the pod, undergrads are in his DMs.</p>
<p>All forms of steak.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a Persian.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the vanguard of all the virgins.</p>
<p>The queen of quinoa.</p>
<p>The sultan of science, David Friedberg.</p>
<p>Just for the record, there&rsquo;s no undergrads in my DMs, but I appreciate the intro.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll check.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>In three, two, he&rsquo;s trying.</p>
<p>Mark Friedberg is tweaked and the show hasn&rsquo;t started.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m taking over intros next week.</p>
<p>Okay, do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at least going to do J-Cal.</p>
<p>Please, by all means, next week, you do mine.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a comedian who has a chance to prepare in advance and think your thoughts.</p>
<p>Go ahead, big boy.</p>
<p>Give me a week.</p>
<p>You got it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Cheers next week.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see these latent stand-up skills in action.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been hiding them from us.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know a lot of stand-ups who hide their ability.</p>
<p>You know the funny thing about hiding something and not having something?</p>
<p>From the outside in, they look the same.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t tell the difference.</p>
<p>Sorry, J-Cal, I&rsquo;ll go over to you.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s dropping annual letters in luxurious sweaters.</p>
<p>As far as the specs go, well, it can only get better.</p>
<p>The dictator himself, Jamaal Falihafetih.</p>
<p>Ouch.</p>
<p>I cannot comment on the specs.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>I mean, this is getting brutal.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s writing these?</p>
<p>Oh my Lord.</p>
<p>All right, everybody.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a big week.</p>
<p>Did you read my annual letter, any of you three assholes?</p>
<p>I saw your commentary.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s a no.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a no.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>I reviewed the table where you listed all your results.</p>
<p>And I actually sent it to my team.</p>
<p>I was like, this is a really nice way of summarizing a firm&rsquo;s results over a long period of time.</p>
<p>Because you had every fund, and your totals, and all the key metrics.</p>
<p>Well, can I talk about that for a second?</p>
<p>Yes, please.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s incredible about what you&rsquo;re saying, Sax, is I was interested in a bunch of other</p>
<p>funds that I&rsquo;m invested in and their returns.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ve also seen a bunch of leaked fundraising decks of all kinds of other firms,</p>
<p>from Growth Stage to Crossover to PE.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s incredible that they are not standardized, right?</p>
<p>Some people only show gross IRR.</p>
<p>Some people show net IRR.</p>
<p>Some people don&rsquo;t show the total value of the paid-in capital, which means if you have</p>
<p>a $100 fund, what is the total value of all of its holdings?</p>
<p>Some people don&rsquo;t show DPI, which is distributions of paid-in capital, which means, okay, for</p>
<p>every dollar you&rsquo;ve taken in, how many dollars have you sent out?</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t show all of them, what was shocking to me is how much you can kind of hide, and</p>
<p>play, and manipulate the numbers.</p>
<p>And one of the most crazy things that I saw is that there are these late-stage funds that</p>
<p>write into their fundraising decks that what they actually use are lines of credit to juice</p>
<p>IRR.</p>
<p>So what they do is, if they&rsquo;re about to do a deal, they&rsquo;ll actually get a loan from a</p>
<p>bank, put that money into a company, wait until it&rsquo;s about to get marked up, and then</p>
<p>what they do is they actually call that original money from their LPs and pay back their capital</p>
<p>call line of credit.</p>
<p>So what does it do?</p>
<p>It inflates IRR.</p>
<p>But this is why, if you see the other numbers, it still shows that it&rsquo;s kind of like not</p>
<p>doing much of anything.</p>
<p>So if you ever see multi-hundred percent IRRs or high, huge IRRs with zero DPI and a marginal</p>
<p>TVPI, it&rsquo;s folks that are playing games to trick LPs.</p>
<p>Just a heads-up to everybody.</p>
<p>That is so weird.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re saying is, just to summarize for people in the audience who don&rsquo;t understand,</p>
<p>hey, we get judged on the rate of return each year.</p>
<p>So if the stock market does 7% or 8%, we&rsquo;re expected to do triple that.</p>
<p>So we got to hit 20%, 25% each year.</p>
<p>Now, the clock starts ticking when the money gets called from the LPs, the partners, and</p>
<p>gets put into the company.</p>
<p>So if you invest in your tour of your fund, you pull the money down from the LPs, you</p>
<p>put it into YouTube, whatever it is.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re saying is, they will take a loan against that future money from a bank at an</p>
<p>absurdly low interest rate, let&rsquo;s say 1% or 2%.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>They make the YouTube investment.</p>
<p>Then two years later, YouTube has a price round that marks it up 20x.</p>
<p>Then they put your cash in, in year three of the fund, year two, and pay back the loan.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;ve paid 2% two years in a row, but the thing&rsquo;s gone up 20x.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>What a&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s dirty.</p>
<p>Well, so it&rsquo;s dirty enough that the SEC has actually now introduced legislation, it was</p>
<p>in February, that basically is going to try to uncover all of this nonsense.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;ll have to be much more transparent.</p>
<p>So the format that I used, in my opinion, is the most transparent way of not being able</p>
<p>to hide the cheese.</p>
<p>You show all the critical elements together in a simple table that will make it very obvious</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s playing games and who can actually make money.</p>
<p>So there is a semi-legitimate version of the loan thing, which is, where this comes from</p>
<p>is a capital call loan.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re making a bunch of investments throughout the quarter, a million dollars here for a</p>
<p>C deal, 10 million for a series A. That&rsquo;s happening all the time.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t necessarily want to hit your LPs with capital calls for every single little</p>
<p>small investment.</p>
<p>So what we do is you get a capital call line from SVB or something like that, and then</p>
<p>you do one capital call per quarter.</p>
<p>And so they will loan you the money for one, two, three months, but it&rsquo;s not for a year.</p>
<p>But the reality is if you have a reasonably well-developed infrastructure, you have a</p>
<p>cash forecast of what deals you may or may not close with probabilities.</p>
<p>And so you know what the weighted amount of capital you need to have on your balance</p>
<p>sheet is.</p>
<p>So I agree with you to have a small amount at the edges to pay for expenses, to pay for</p>
<p>salaries while you clean up at the end of a quarter.</p>
<p>Completely reasonable.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re making, you know, five or 10% commitments into a company and you&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>this as a way to basically create subterfuge and hide, I think that that should not be</p>
<p>allowed.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The number of capital calls is annoying for people, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Anyway, I did share that table with our team too, because I did like the format quite a</p>
<p>bit.</p>
<p>I bookmarked it.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll start using it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading it this weekend.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard for funds who are not performant to use that format.</p>
<p>Now yours, you are very highly performant, so you can use that format.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think people that have not returned money or have fake paper markups can use that</p>
<p>format because it is too simple.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, what metric do we all look at when we are LPs in a fund?</p>
<p>Well, this is what I put down.</p>
<p>I put down the ones that I look at for everybody else that I&rsquo;m an LP in, you know?</p>
<p>So what one is that for you?</p>
<p>Multiple on cash investment?</p>
<p>No, I need to look at the totality of it.</p>
<p>I need to understand what is your gross and your net IRRs.</p>
<p>Those are important things to understand because it shows how efficiently you put the money</p>
<p>to work.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>But then ultimately, then the other two things that really matter is what is the total value</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve created and then what percentage of that have you given back to me?</p>
<p>Because that allows you to understand how much paper value this.</p>
<p>So for example, today, let&rsquo;s just say you had a fund that had a TVPI, total value of</p>
<p>paid-in capital of a 5x.</p>
<p>A 5x on a fund is incredible.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;ve distributed none of that, well, guess what?</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re sitting here in May of 2023 or 2022, rather, the total value of your paid-in capital</p>
<p>is not really 5x.</p>
<p>It may be only 3x and it may be actually 2.5x considering what the markets have done</p>
<p>to these companies, right?</p>
<p>And so it allows me to really understand how performant funds are in not just being a part</p>
<p>of the game, but actually generating realizations.</p>
<p>And this is the hardest part.</p>
<p>As I told you, Jason, this past quarter, I think I passed 2x across my funds when I was</p>
<p>managing outside capital.</p>
<p>And I think, my gosh, it took me 11 years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>To return 2x the money.</p>
<p>And that means I&rsquo;ve returned $2.5 billion.</p>
<p>You know how hard that was?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, you got to time the exit.</p>
<p>You have to have the ability to exit.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t even time the exit.</p>
<p>You have to be constantly managing and working your portfolio.</p>
<p>Sometimes you&rsquo;re selling in secondary transactions.</p>
<p>Sometimes you&rsquo;re actually trading up in private markets where you help this company merge</p>
<p>with another private company.</p>
<p>Other times, if I think about it, the number of IPOs I&rsquo;ve had is relatively diminutive.</p>
<p>So how do you make $2 billion where I&rsquo;ve only had one IPO, which has been Slack?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So this is a really, really hard business.</p>
<p>And it was just a reminder that in the last four or five years, managing capital has seemed</p>
<p>relatively easy.</p>
<p>But in these next few years, you&rsquo;re going to see who&rsquo;s really, really good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of that old Warren Buffett quote.</p>
<p>You can see who&rsquo;s naked when the tide goes up.</p>
<p>I mean, said another way, the last five years, raising a fund has been really easy.</p>
<p>And writing checks has been really easy.</p>
<p>And now comes, you know, Act III, which is returning a multiple on the money you easily</p>
<p>collect it.</p>
<p>And boy, is that hard.</p>
<p>And I, you know, I, all of these new LPs.</p>
<p>The other thing that I want to tell you is one thing, though, all these LPs send me,</p>
<p>even though I&rsquo;m not an LP and a potential, they send potential LPs their performance</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re so proud of it, like quarterly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, not even in this fund.</p>
<p>And they have these crazy markups, crypto investments, this, whatever.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;ve returned no capital.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like, just to give you a sense of it, if you look at the most fantastic organization</p>
<p>in the world, if it were an investment manager, which is Berkshire, their long run 50 year</p>
<p>track record is, you know, around 20%, right?</p>
<p>Gross.</p>
<p>If you look at the most successful asset manager in the world, and I would put Blackstone at</p>
<p>that just incredibly good and best in class and probably three enormous parts of the worldwide</p>
<p>economy, real estate, credit, and private equity.</p>
<p>You know, their long run track record is that on 200 and some odd billion dollars of private</p>
<p>equity and another hundred billion dollars of, of, of real estate, they&rsquo;ve returned</p>
<p>two X.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what the upper bound is, you know, doubling people&rsquo;s money and generating 15</p>
<p>to 20% is the best you can expect if you are really excellent and long lived.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best.</p>
<p>What do you look at Freeberg when you&rsquo;re an LP?</p>
<p>What number do you care about?</p>
<p>Because you LP other funds and I think all of us do at times.</p>
<p>I made my first venture fund investment in 2006.</p>
<p>And I, I am still getting distributions from that fund.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m looking at it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, this is a 2.4 X over that period of time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, what the hell?</p>
<p>Why did I even put this money into this fund?</p>
<p>I guess this makes sense for pension funds and, you know, very large balance sheet,</p>
<p>long range investors that need to kind of diversify.</p>
<p>But as an individual, I should have put my money and have had liquidity on it for 16</p>
<p>years rather than have it locked up and a bunch of private companies sloshing around</p>
<p>and, you know, kind of dribble out.</p>
<p>And at the end of all this, I only get two and a half times my money back.</p>
<p>Two and a half times your money in 16 years.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that IRR?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like low teens.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Not a great deal.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s lower.</p>
<p>You would have been better owning the S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And so for me, I think the key, the metric, the only metric that matters, which I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying Chamath, is how much cash I got out relative to cash I put in.</p>
<p>And so initially my IRR is negative 97%.</p>
<p>And then it goes up to negative 80 and then negative 60 and negative 30 and negative 20.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s 14% because I finally got more money out than I put in.</p>
<p>And so it doesn&rsquo;t feel to me like, you know, just generally private investing,</p>
<p>everyone gets excited because we all get sold stories and individuals all get sold stories of</p>
<p>you put $1 in, you get $100 in.</p>
<p>I mean, J. Cal wrote a book called How I Made $100 Million from whatever you invested in Uber.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And that story, I think, gets everyone kind of excited.</p>
<p>But the reality is, the vast majority of the time, and if you diversify your bets like this,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to end up waiting a long time to get your money back.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be locked up.</p>
<p>And a top performing fund is returning two and a half x after 15 years, which is not much better</p>
<p>than kind of investing in the S&amp;P where you could sell that anytime you want and use that cash for</p>
<p>any purpose you want.</p>
<p>Well, if you did $100,000 investment, and you return 260,000 in 15 years,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on an IRR calculator right now, internal rate of return at 6.58%.</p>
<p>Yeah, better off than the S&amp;P.</p>
<p>Um, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, and if you did QQQQ, depending on, yeah, how hot the market was then, yeah.</p>
<p>And you get to sell-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, really, really hard to actually make money.</p>
<p>There are always going to be periods where people look like geniuses and have markups.</p>
<p>But you can really see when people have skill after a decade and a couple of up and down cycles.</p>
<p>Same with hedge funds, by the way, right?</p>
<p>Hedge funds put up a score every year.</p>
<p>And in certain macro cycles that can last many, many years,</p>
<p>everyone looks like they&rsquo;re doing well.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden, tides go out and you lose more than you made over that period of time.</p>
<p>And then you realize, holy crap, I was actually in an insurance business,</p>
<p>where you get paid some small premium every year.</p>
<p>And then you have some massive loss one year.</p>
<p>And that massive loss, it turns out your underwriting wasn&rsquo;t good because you lose more</p>
<p>than the sum of all of the premium you collected over that period of time.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, a lot of investing looks like this, which is</p>
<p>you have small returns for a long period of time, and then some massive loss.</p>
<p>And the whole business makes you look like, along the way, a genius.</p>
<p>But the reality is over any long cycle, most folks end up in a bad position.</p>
<p>And they end up-</p>
<p>You know, the SEC, by the way, has solved this for mutual funds, right?</p>
<p>And ETFs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very strict standard reporting.</p>
<p>And I do think that as, for example, if you go to the big banks,</p>
<p>sorry, Sachs, interrupt.</p>
<p>I just want to finish the last thought.</p>
<p>If you go to the big banks and you have, if you&rsquo;re an individual,</p>
<p>like a doctor or a dentist or somebody, and they will aggregate and pool capital</p>
<p>and put it into these funds on your behalf, as an example.</p>
<p>So it looks like JP Morgan or Goldman Sachs is a 50 or $100 million LP in one of these big funds.</p>
<p>But in fact, it&rsquo;s just the sum of a bunch of folks on their platform.</p>
<p>It stands to reason that if the SEC can actually mandate standardized reporting</p>
<p>for private investing, it would actually be a really good thing because all of these games</p>
<p>will, and probably currently are, as far as I&rsquo;ve seen in these presentations,</p>
<p>tricking a lot of folks to put their hard-earned money into things that</p>
<p>actually will never make money.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because if you selectively cherry pick how you present this data,</p>
<p>you can tell a partial truth.</p>
<p>So, you know, I would really, I would love, I&rsquo;m happy to be compared to any organization,</p>
<p>but every time I hear somebody chirping about how good they are,</p>
<p>my only comment is, I just want to see your table in the same format as my table,</p>
<p>and we can compare it because it allows me to really understand.</p>
<p>Yeah, liquid returns.</p>
<p>And by the way, the point I made earlier about when markets are generally good,</p>
<p>hedge fund, public market investors generally can look like they&rsquo;re doing well by</p>
<p>having a good marginal return above the benchmark every year,</p>
<p>and then one year have a big drawdown,</p>
<p>and suddenly they realize that their underwriting wasn&rsquo;t that good.</p>
<p>The same can be true in private investing in the opposite way,</p>
<p>in the sense that you&rsquo;ll put in small checks, small checks,</p>
<p>and lose money and lose money and lose money and then have one big banger,</p>
<p>and you get 100x return, and you look like a genius,</p>
<p>because your whole portfolio looks good.</p>
<p>But you fast forward and you keep doing that for another 10 years,</p>
<p>all those small checks may not even add up to the banger.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the flip reality that you realize.</p>
<p>And by the way, I think that&rsquo;s a good analogy for the difference</p>
<p>between public and private investing.</p>
<p>You have similar cash flow economics,</p>
<p>where you can have small returns and then a big loss in public.</p>
<p>And you can have small losses and then a big return in private.</p>
<p>And the timing of when you present your data can make anyone look good.</p>
<p>If you catch a good hit at the right time,</p>
<p>or you don&rsquo;t have a bad hit at the wrong time.</p>
<p>And then the framing over a long enough period of time,</p>
<p>I think really becomes the key measure.</p>
<p>And the reality is most people don&rsquo;t make it long enough in their career</p>
<p>to actually present true results in how they really do underwrite.</p>
<p>And by the way, to the extent anybody&rsquo;s listening</p>
<p>is able to invest in these private funds.</p>
<p>I think Jason mentioned this superficially.</p>
<p>So let me just dig into it,</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s really, really thoughtful what he said,</p>
<p>which you should understand.</p>
<p>If you have the option to invest in a private fund,</p>
<p>you have to understand that that private fund</p>
<p>has two huge negative things working against it</p>
<p>relative to investing in the S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p>So you could put your money into a Vanguard ETF,</p>
<p>or if you could put your money into a private fund,</p>
<p>you need to realize two things.</p>
<p>Number one is it is illiquid, not just for 10 years,</p>
<p>but it could be illiquid for 12 or 14 or in,</p>
<p>you know, Friedberg&rsquo;s case, 16 years.</p>
<p>So you need to get paid a premium for owning that.</p>
<p>And then the second is depending on the business model,</p>
<p>you may have very high failure rates,</p>
<p>which means that you need to really hit</p>
<p>these outsized Grand Slam home runs.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t, then you&rsquo;re going to be worse off</p>
<p>than if you had invested in the S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p>So that deserves a premium.</p>
<p>And so Jason&rsquo;s right, which is the S&amp;P is between 7% and 8%</p>
<p>over long periods of time, predictable compounding.</p>
<p>You have to add another 7% to 8% for this illiquidity premium,</p>
<p>and another 7% to 8% for the business model viability of,</p>
<p>for example, being in venture.</p>
<p>When you add those three things together,</p>
<p>you do need to get paid, basically,</p>
<p>in the low to mid 20s returns to be justified.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you are much better off just owning the S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p>Much, much, much better off.</p>
<p>Sachs, what do you look for when you&rsquo;re LPing?</p>
<p>And now that you have many large funds,</p>
<p>what do you think LPs are looking for now?</p>
<p>And what do you advise them to stay focused on?</p>
<p>The number one metric that matters is DPI,</p>
<p>which is the ratio of distributions to paid-in capital.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s basically money in versus money out, right?</p>
<p>At the end of the day, that&rsquo;s all that matters is</p>
<p>how much money did you put in the fund?</p>
<p>How much money did you get out?</p>
<p>The issue is that to Chamath&rsquo;s point,</p>
<p>these are 10 to 12-year funds,</p>
<p>and it takes a long time to get distributions.</p>
<p>So all the other metrics are basically triangulations</p>
<p>or approximations of what you think the fund&rsquo;s going to do</p>
<p>until you actually get to distributions.</p>
<p>So I would say in the long term, it&rsquo;s all DPI.</p>
<p>In the short term, you look at TVPI,</p>
<p>the total value to paid-in capital.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically what&rsquo;s the marked-up value</p>
<p>of all the positions in the portfolio</p>
<p>versus how much cash has gone in.</p>
<p>And then the big question is,</p>
<p>does the TVPI turn into DPI?</p>
<p>Does the total value turn to distributions?</p>
<p>To explain that to people,</p>
<p>if Chamath had invested in Slack,</p>
<p>but there hadn&rsquo;t been an outcome,</p>
<p>it could be on the books for a billion-dollar position.</p>
<p>So the TVPI is looking really great.</p>
<p>But until that company goes public</p>
<p>and the shares are distributed,</p>
<p>the LPs haven&rsquo;t realized it.</p>
<p>So it could be ephemeral,</p>
<p>or it could go down significantly,</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ve seen with public markets.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So in the last four months,</p>
<p>we just returned our fund one</p>
<p>in terms of real distributions.</p>
<p>I think we have a DPI of 1.1 or 1.2 on that fund now.</p>
<p>The TVPI is four to five.</p>
<p>But it feels great just to distribute the entire fund out.</p>
<p>I literally, in my first two funds,</p>
<p>I think we did that as well.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a really great feeling.</p>
<p>And sometimes selling 10% or 20% of a position early</p>
<p>and getting over that hurdle</p>
<p>and just getting into the one to two X,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a pretty great feeling.</p>
<p>By the way, just to talk about how difficult it is</p>
<p>to convert paper gains into real gains.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say, Jason, in your example,</p>
<p>you had a fund that had these huge paper gains,</p>
<p>but haven&rsquo;t distributed anything coming into this year.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a little interesting data</p>
<p>about the ultimate buyer of all of these tech stocks,</p>
<p>which is the NASDAQ, right?</p>
<p>People that buy stocks in the NASDAQ.</p>
<p>Listen to this as of yesterday.</p>
<p>More than 45% of stocks on the NASDAQ are now down 50%.</p>
<p>So basically one in two.</p>
<p>More than 22% of stocks on the NASDAQ are down 75%.</p>
<p>So almost one in four and more than one in five.</p>
<p>And then more than 5% of stocks, so one in 20,</p>
<p>on the NASDAQ are down 90%.</p>
<p>So you can use this to actually get a blended average.</p>
<p>But what it means is that the ultimate buyers of tech stocks</p>
<p>are taking a 60% discount to what they were able to buy</p>
<p>even just four months ago.</p>
<p>60%.</p>
<p>So there is no public mark</p>
<p>that will support a private mark</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s also discounted by at least 60%.</p>
<p>Now think about that when you talk about</p>
<p>this entire panoply of companies that have been overfunded,</p>
<p>many who are under executing</p>
<p>and burning enormous amounts of money,</p>
<p>who now have to come back out to the market.</p>
<p>Any sophisticated buyer will have to tell them the truth,</p>
<p>which is, I&rsquo;m sorry guys, but the data says</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a 60% discount to this mark.</p>
<p>Are you willing to accept it or not?</p>
<p>Otherwise the lights are going to go off.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And these marks only happen,</p>
<p>at least in the private markets and venture funds,</p>
<p>when a transaction occurs.</p>
<p>So if somebody raised a bunch of money,</p>
<p>as we talked about in previous episodes,</p>
<p>at a billion dollars,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re now worth 500 million,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s only going to work itself out in fund documents</p>
<p>and reports for a year or two later</p>
<p>when the next transaction occurs.</p>
<p>So there is a lagging effect.</p>
<p>One thing I just want to bring up</p>
<p>before we go into maybe GDP</p>
<p>or the Bill Hwang situation</p>
<p>is what we talked about on this pod last year</p>
<p>about what was going to happen in private markets.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been seeing the last two or three weeks,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know, Sax and Freeberg,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re seeing in private markets,</p>
<p>but really acutely,</p>
<p>people who are going out and skipping rounds,</p>
<p>this like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to just skip my seed round</p>
<p>and just do a series A.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have product market fit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to get credit for work that hasn&rsquo;t been done.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to raise 10 million without product market fit.</p>
<p>Oh, my Lord, has this,</p>
<p>has the dialogue changed?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on many calls with founders</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve met with 50 VCs,</p>
<p>and the conversations are moving to,</p>
<p>you know, how many months to break even?</p>
<p>And, you know,</p>
<p>how many customers do you have?</p>
<p>And how have they increased?</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s talk about the churn.</p>
<p>It is getting super pragmatic out there.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a founder,</p>
<p>and we said this a year ago,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s worth stating here,</p>
<p>this is not the moment I would try to over-optimize.</p>
<p>If you have a term sheet or money on the table,</p>
<p>I would close it.</p>
<p>Just, you know, founder to founder.</p>
<p>What are you seeing, Saxe?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s gotten a lot harder,</p>
<p>I think, especially at the growth rounds.</p>
<p>We actually have signed</p>
<p>two growth term sheets recently,</p>
<p>and it was much harder for us</p>
<p>to do growth rounds last year,</p>
<p>just because you had these huge mega funds</p>
<p>come in at crazy valuations.</p>
<p>But now they&rsquo;re kind of licking their wounds,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re starting to see</p>
<p>some really attractive growth opportunities.</p>
<p>Everyone else has backed off.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s changed quickly.</p>
<p>Yeah. Now, one thing,</p>
<p>so, you know, Travath raised a good point about,</p>
<p>you know, private,</p>
<p>not only are private valuations sort of sticky,</p>
<p>but private marks are sticky.</p>
<p>And, you know, companies only get remarked</p>
<p>every couple of years.</p>
<p>And so whereas the public markets</p>
<p>get remarked every day.</p>
<p>So it is hard to know,</p>
<p>like, what is the proper valuation</p>
<p>of a company that raised money last year?</p>
<p>Because, yes, valuation multiples</p>
<p>have come way down,</p>
<p>but then also they may have grown,</p>
<p>and their performance is better.</p>
<p>So the analysis that I saw Jason Lemkin do</p>
<p>in his LP newsletter,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re basically repeating it</p>
<p>for our entire portfolio,</p>
<p>is to calculate,</p>
<p>what was the ARR multiple that you paid?</p>
<p>Basically, valuation divided by ARR.</p>
<p>What was that entry multiple?</p>
<p>And what is it today?</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re doing that</p>
<p>across our whole portfolio.</p>
<p>So what you see is&hellip;</p>
<p>Sorry, sorry, Sax.</p>
<p>Sorry, sorry, Sax, clarification.</p>
<p>LTM ARR, or, you know,</p>
<p>NTM ARR, which one?</p>
<p>Basically, you look&hellip;</p>
<p>Last 12 months, next 12 months?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, you just look at</p>
<p>their current ARR, which is,</p>
<p>you know, run rate,</p>
<p>their current run rate revenue.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So take January, you times it by 12?</p>
<p>Or in this case, April.</p>
<p>Yeah, basically, yes.</p>
<p>You take the current month</p>
<p>and multiply by 12.</p>
<p>But they have to be annual commitments, right?</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>it has to be annually recurring revenue.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s not an annual commitment</p>
<p>with an expectation that&rsquo;s recurring,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t count it.</p>
<p>So for example,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t count professional</p>
<p>services revenue in that, in any event.</p>
<p>So the point is,</p>
<p>you basically calculate</p>
<p>what was the multiple</p>
<p>that you paid at,</p>
<p>you know, entry in the company.</p>
<p>And what is it today</p>
<p>as a function of the current valuation?</p>
<p>And what we see is, yeah,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of companies</p>
<p>that we got into,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, two years ago</p>
<p>at a valuation multiple</p>
<p>that you couldn&rsquo;t defend today.</p>
<p>60 times, 80 times, 100 times.</p>
<p>But the multiple today</p>
<p>is more like 10 or 20 times,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s actually grown really fast.</p>
<p>So you need to look at</p>
<p>both sides of the equation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the analysis</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re running for every company</p>
<p>in our portfolio.</p>
<p>And then, you know,</p>
<p>LPs can decide how to market.</p>
<p>I mean, the most important thing is</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the next investor,</p>
<p>if they need more capital,</p>
<p>going to market at?</p>
<p>Well, the question is,</p>
<p>are you growing faster</p>
<p>than valuation multiples are falling?</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And then can you,</p>
<p>that means you could have a down round,</p>
<p>a neutral round,</p>
<p>or possibly an up round,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So are you starting to see people</p>
<p>or people discussing on the board level</p>
<p>or in your firm?</p>
<p>Hey, maybe we take a sideways round,</p>
<p>a neutral round.</p>
<p>We just go to last year&rsquo;s price</p>
<p>and top off another 10 million.</p>
<p>Are you seeing that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve told some of the boards I&rsquo;m on,</p>
<p>just keep fundraising,</p>
<p>just keep the round open</p>
<p>and top off if there&rsquo;s money available.</p>
<p>Because, you know,</p>
<p>especially if you raised around</p>
<p>eight months ago, six months ago,</p>
<p>those prices,</p>
<p>like if people are still willing</p>
<p>to invest in those terms,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good deal.</p>
<p>I literally had this conversation</p>
<p>with the founder this week</p>
<p>where they had raised that</p>
<p>in a great valuation</p>
<p>and they turned money away.</p>
<p>Because they were like,</p>
<p>Yeah, that was a mistake.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still growing.</p>
<p>So why would we take the money now</p>
<p>if our valuation is going to be,</p>
<p>you know, double in nine months?</p>
<p>And now it looks like,</p>
<p>yeah, maybe, you know,</p>
<p>that extra one to $5 million</p>
<p>would have been good to lock up.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So adding to these headwinds,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve been talking</p>
<p>about the possibility</p>
<p>of a recession</p>
<p>for those new to the concept</p>
<p>of recession</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re under the age of 30</p>
<p>and haven&rsquo;t really lived through one</p>
<p>as an adult.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s two quarters,</p>
<p>the official definition,</p>
<p>two quarters of negative growth</p>
<p>of the GDP.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out US GDP</p>
<p>fell 1.4% in Q1.</p>
<p>And Q4, we had a 6.9% growth rate.</p>
<p>Q1 was the weakest</p>
<p>since the spring of 2020</p>
<p>when COVID hit.</p>
<p>Nick, cue the clip</p>
<p>where Sachs and I basically said,</p>
<p>this may happen in January of this year.</p>
<p>So the concern is that,</p>
<p>you know, with the losses we&rsquo;re seeing,</p>
<p>and I mean, every day,</p>
<p>it just keeps like you see more red</p>
<p>that this could turn into a recession.</p>
<p>You know, popping of bubbles</p>
<p>is usually followed by a recession.</p>
<p>So I think, you know,</p>
<p>the fortunes of the economy</p>
<p>could turn really quickly here.</p>
<p>And that is the marginal risk.</p>
<p>The marginal risk</p>
<p>is actually for recession.</p>
<p>David is saying something</p>
<p>really important.</p>
<p>The risk, in my opinion,</p>
<p>is not of runaway inflation anymore.</p>
<p>The Fed is now in this</p>
<p>really delicate situation</p>
<p>where China cut rates last week.</p>
<p>We have an FOMC meeting,</p>
<p>the Open Markets Committee</p>
<p>that sets rates on Wednesday,</p>
<p>I think of this coming week.</p>
<p>What is he supposed to do?</p>
<p>The risk is to a recession</p>
<p>because if we overcorrect.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And the leading indicators</p>
<p>all around the world</p>
<p>tell us that their economies are weak,</p>
<p>then inflation may have actually been</p>
<p>much more transitory than we thought.</p>
<p>And right now we have to decide</p>
<p>because if we overcorrect,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to plunge</p>
<p>the United States economy</p>
<p>into a recession.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of data here.</p>
<p>And obviously this is.</p>
<p>When this data is always</p>
<p>in the review mirror,</p>
<p>so obviously we&rsquo;re talking about Q1,</p>
<p>it takes a while to collect this data.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of different factors</p>
<p>going on at the same time,</p>
<p>obviously COVID and obviously supply chains.</p>
<p>Consumer spending rose at a 2.7%</p>
<p>annual rate in Q1,</p>
<p>a slight acceleration from Q4.</p>
<p>There was also a 9.2%</p>
<p>rise in business spending.</p>
<p>So we have a lot of spending going on.</p>
<p>Who knows if that is spending</p>
<p>that actually occurred</p>
<p>in the previous quarters</p>
<p>and because of supply chains,</p>
<p>like people&rsquo;s cars are being delivered,</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s machines and manufacturing equipment</p>
<p>is being delivered now.</p>
<p>We had negative GDP in Q1</p>
<p>for a whole host of reasons</p>
<p>that can effectively be summarized</p>
<p>by the fact that we are still trying to</p>
<p>restart an economy</p>
<p>at the tail end of a pandemic,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re doing it in fits and starts.</p>
<p>And so we have these small bursts</p>
<p>of incredible GDP,</p>
<p>which we had last year,</p>
<p>and then contractions in the economy.</p>
<p>The thing that&rsquo;s always been true</p>
<p>about the United States</p>
<p>is that we are a consumer-driven</p>
<p>economic engine,</p>
<p>which means that as long</p>
<p>as people feel confident</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re buying things,</p>
<p>the economy tends to do well</p>
<p>and we tend to move forward as a society.</p>
<p>When consumer confidence ebbs</p>
<p>and people contract their spending,</p>
<p>we are in a world of hurt.</p>
<p>The last couple of years,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had a lot of consumer savings.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had a lot of money</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been pent up in the system,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s stimulus checks</p>
<p>or loan forgiveness,</p>
<p>or all of this stuff</p>
<p>has allowed people to feel much richer.</p>
<p>And as a result,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve started to spend in drips and drabs.</p>
<p>The problem now is that</p>
<p>because prices are so high,</p>
<p>all of those savings</p>
<p>have largely been depleted.</p>
<p>I just sent you guys a text</p>
<p>in the group chat</p>
<p>of what consumer spending looks like</p>
<p>in consumer savings, rather.</p>
<p>And it tells a really, really scary story,</p>
<p>which is that</p>
<p>the savings boom is largely over.</p>
<p>Personal savings rate fell to 6.2% in March,</p>
<p>the lowest since 2013.</p>
<p>And so what does that mean?</p>
<p>Well, it means that the setup is there</p>
<p>for us to sort of really contract</p>
<p>what we are able to spend as a society.</p>
<p>So I think now the odds</p>
<p>even push further in this direction</p>
<p>that we could have more quarters</p>
<p>of negative GDP.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re back to what we talked about before,</p>
<p>which is a 2019-like scenario</p>
<p>where the government,</p>
<p>or the Fed specifically,</p>
<p>races forward to tackle inflation.</p>
<p>And in 2018 and 19,</p>
<p>it turned out to be a head fake.</p>
<p>And by the way,</p>
<p>in 2019, the stock market ended up</p>
<p>more than 30%,</p>
<p>up 32% or something like that.</p>
<p>Crazy numbers.</p>
<p>Here, and by the way,</p>
<p>back then in 2019,</p>
<p>China turned over.</p>
<p>It looked like it was going to be</p>
<p>a fast-moving economic recovery for China.</p>
<p>And instead, they sort of slowed down.</p>
<p>We have the same thing here.</p>
<p>We have a quarter of negative GDP.</p>
<p>We have China in lockdowns.</p>
<p>We have every company</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in the manufacturing</p>
<p>supply chain ecosystem</p>
<p>telling the world</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t really know</p>
<p>what this is going to look like.</p>
<p>Intel today actually said</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be shortages</p>
<p>in chips through 2024.</p>
<p>So I think it could be</p>
<p>a very difficult path ahead for the Fed.</p>
<p>How do you raise rates</p>
<p>400 basis points</p>
<p>into a slowing economy?</p>
<p>You could raise basis points 75,</p>
<p>you know, 75 bps,</p>
<p>maybe 100 bps,</p>
<p>but it gives them</p>
<p>very little freedom to operate</p>
<p>without really tanking the economy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also another point</p>
<p>to highlight here,</p>
<p>which is in some of this data,</p>
<p>that was released,</p>
<p>there was a strong indication</p>
<p>that there are real issues</p>
<p>right now with inventories.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you guys</p>
<p>have tried to buy an appliance</p>
<p>or a car lately,</p>
<p>or a piece of furniture,</p>
<p>but like&hellip;</p>
<p>I tried in the Q4 to buy a car</p>
<p>and it was absurd.</p>
<p>I mean, right now,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like one year delays</p>
<p>to get a frigging couch.</p>
<p>I mean, like everything</p>
<p>in the global supply chain,</p>
<p>somewhat related to the kind of</p>
<p>big inflationary pressure</p>
<p>that hit us at the end of last year.</p>
<p>And then everyone placed orders.</p>
<p>All the factories kind of</p>
<p>had to produce a lot.</p>
<p>They all couldn&rsquo;t keep up</p>
<p>through to what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>in China right now,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s lockdowns</p>
<p>and factories are shut down.</p>
<p>I have several businesses</p>
<p>in the hardware space</p>
<p>that are actively searching</p>
<p>and frantically trying to find</p>
<p>components, suppliers,</p>
<p>specific parts,</p>
<p>even basic raw materials</p>
<p>like aluminum</p>
<p>are very hard to get ahold of.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>a very challenging inventory</p>
<p>and supply chain problem.</p>
<p>When that happens,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t actually wire money</p>
<p>and buy aluminum</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m waiting</p>
<p>for aluminum to show up.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wire and buy</p>
<p>the microchips I want.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wire money</p>
<p>to my car dealership</p>
<p>and buy money.</p>
<p>So that doesn&rsquo;t get credited</p>
<p>on the GDP counter</p>
<p>because those sales</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t close that quarter.</p>
<p>And as we saw with Amazon</p>
<p>recently and others,</p>
<p>and Apple just said</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re expecting,</p>
<p>I think, close to a $10 billion</p>
<p>hit this quarter</p>
<p>because of supply chain issues.</p>
<p>A lot of folks want to spend</p>
<p>the spending interest is there.</p>
<p>The capital flows are there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the supply chain</p>
<p>is clogged up</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re so dependent</p>
<p>on getting atoms</p>
<p>and molecules moved around,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all kind of held up</p>
<p>in different places</p>
<p>that folks simply</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t get their purchases in.</p>
<p>And so the revenue</p>
<p>triggers don&rsquo;t get hit.</p>
<p>And so the numbers</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t look good</p>
<p>from a growth perspective,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean</p>
<p>that the demand isn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>This is a significant</p>
<p>inventory problem</p>
<p>and supply chain problem</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s driving a lot of this</p>
<p>adversity right now</p>
<p>in the market, it seems.</p>
<p>And interestingly,</p>
<p>by the way,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t mean,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to have a recession</p>
<p>because when I&rsquo;m not able</p>
<p>to spend money on Apple,</p>
<p>Apple spending less</p>
<p>on their suppliers,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re spending less</p>
<p>on their suppliers.</p>
<p>So there is a trickling effect</p>
<p>of capital flows</p>
<p>and the recessionary effect</p>
<p>may be hit.</p>
<p>But there is capital</p>
<p>and there is demand</p>
<p>for consumption.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that we&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>clogged up right now.</p>
<p>Well, and the consumer</p>
<p>confidence index</p>
<p>has been on a bit</p>
<p>of a roller coaster.</p>
<p>We were at 130</p>
<p>before the pandemic.</p>
<p>For the year of the pandemic,</p>
<p>we were down in the high 80s,</p>
<p>87, 88, 89.</p>
<p>We rocketed back up,</p>
<p>you know, in 2021,</p>
<p>people started to feel like,</p>
<p>oh, we&rsquo;ve got these vaccines,</p>
<p>things are going to go</p>
<p>back to normal,</p>
<p>rocket back up to 128.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been a slow tick down</p>
<p>to where we&rsquo;re now at 107.</p>
<p>And so I think consumers</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what to think.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know if,</p>
<p>you know, inflation</p>
<p>is transitory.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know if gas</p>
<p>is going to be $7 or $4.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if they should spend a big,</p>
<p>spend on a big vacation or not.</p>
<p>And so this, I think,</p>
<p>in terms of people&rsquo;s planning,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if people can plan</p>
<p>how their own personal budgets,</p>
<p>right? And I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>on the confidence thing</p>
<p>to Chamath&rsquo;s point.</p>
<p>We need to have</p>
<p>a predictable economy,</p>
<p>you know, and it can&rsquo;t be this</p>
<p>schizophrenic,</p>
<p>to use a term.</p>
<p>Sax, what do you,</p>
<p>what do you think about</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re seeing here</p>
<p>in terms of,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re obviously</p>
<p>either in a recession</p>
<p>or dip, you know,</p>
<p>dancing around it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re basically,</p>
<p>you know, on the edge</p>
<p>of the cliff right now.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>the most accurate.</p>
<p>I tweeted in February.</p>
<p>Hey, anyone noticed</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve just entered</p>
<p>a recession and I got dunked</p>
<p>on by all the professional</p>
<p>economists and, you know,</p>
<p>all these people,</p>
<p>but the experts,</p>
<p>the experts,</p>
<p>the experts,</p>
<p>correct.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the data just came out</p>
<p>negative 1.5%</p>
<p>economic growth in Q1.</p>
<p>So what I wrote at the time</p>
<p>was exactly right.</p>
<p>And, you know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how the threat,</p>
<p>the Fed threads this needle.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>a slowing economy</p>
<p>with negative GDP growth.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got inflation</p>
<p>is still rampant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>as high as last year,</p>
<p>just because we&rsquo;re lapping</p>
<p>a much bigger number</p>
<p>from last year.</p>
<p>So on a year over year basis,</p>
<p>the comps are,</p>
<p>you know, you start</p>
<p>at a higher price level,</p>
<p>but inflation is still there.</p>
<p>So, you know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>you do about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>tough situation.</p>
<p>And when you have this</p>
<p>kind of wealth destruction</p>
<p>in the stock market,</p>
<p>I mean, you know,</p>
<p>there was a good tweet</p>
<p>that Jamal, you shared,</p>
<p>but you put it up on the screen.</p>
<p>I mean, so much like wealth</p>
<p>has been destroyed.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t necessarily see it</p>
<p>if you just look at</p>
<p>the big cap indices,</p>
<p>but you look at all the engines of</p>
<p>sort of growth and prosperity,</p>
<p>the small caps,</p>
<p>the recent IPOs,</p>
<p>the growth stocks,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been absolutely hammered.</p>
<p>It really hasn&rsquo;t been this bad</p>
<p>since the dot-com crash of 2000,</p>
<p>like, and not just the,</p>
<p>like April period,</p>
<p>but like all the way in October</p>
<p>where it kept going.</p>
<p>And then the 2008,</p>
<p>yeah, the 2008 real estate crash.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re already,</p>
<p>like top three worst situations</p>
<p>for growth stocks</p>
<p>in the last 20 years.</p>
<p>And when you have</p>
<p>that kind of like wealth destruction,</p>
<p>it eventually trickles down</p>
<p>into the economy</p>
<p>because people just feel,</p>
<p>you know, companies</p>
<p>start cutting budgets.</p>
<p>People have less money.</p>
<p>The spending goes down.</p>
<p>That dynamic that,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re referring to</p>
<p>in this tweet in that image</p>
<p>is called dispersion,</p>
<p>which means,</p>
<p>you know, people may be confused</p>
<p>when you hear</p>
<p>why are all these stocks down so much,</p>
<p>but the indices are not down as much.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s exactly for the reason</p>
<p>that David just said,</p>
<p>which is that</p>
<p>underneath the surface,</p>
<p>the mega cap techs</p>
<p>consume so much of the market cap</p>
<p>of these indices.</p>
<p>So, you know, the Googles,</p>
<p>the Microsofts,</p>
<p>the Apples,</p>
<p>and the Teslas.</p>
<p>Those four just clog up</p>
<p>an enormous percentage.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s approaching</p>
<p>40% of these,</p>
<p>of these indices.</p>
<p>And so underneath the surface,</p>
<p>you have dispersion,</p>
<p>which means you have</p>
<p>these tail of two kinds of stocks.</p>
<p>You have these four big mega caps,</p>
<p>and then you have everybody else.</p>
<p>And the mega caps</p>
<p>are generating so much cash</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re just basically</p>
<p>keeping the market afloat.</p>
<p>So at this point,</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s a small silver lining.</p>
<p>And that silver lining is that</p>
<p>to be bearish right now</p>
<p>is effectively not being bearish</p>
<p>these growth stocks,</p>
<p>because as we said,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been just decimated.</p>
<p>At this point,</p>
<p>to be bearish the indices</p>
<p>means very specifically</p>
<p>to be bearish those four names</p>
<p>and only those four names.</p>
<p>And so that may actually mean</p>
<p>that the market</p>
<p>has effectively crashed already.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYeah, but by the way,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not necessarily bearish</p>
<p>on growth stocks from here,</p>
<p>because like you said,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve already been beat up so badly.</p>
<p>The stock market&rsquo;s</p>
<p>usually a leading indicator.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m bearish about</p>
<p>is just the state of the economy,</p>
<p>because the stock market</p>
<p>trades down on expectations.</p>
<p>So it was already trading down</p>
<p>months ahead of the slowdown</p>
<p>in the real economy.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe market knew in December.</p>
<p>The market knew in November.</p>
<p>The recession was coming.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIn like around November 6th of last year.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThey knew it was coming in.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe market knew</p>
<p>when we talked about the sales</p>
<p>that Bezos and Musk did,</p>
<p>when we sold equities,</p>
<p>we were saying,</p>
<p>like, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t keep all of your money</p>
<p>on the table all the time</p>
<p>unless you have</p>
<p>the durational wherewithal,</p>
<p>meaning you&rsquo;re just not time-bounded</p>
<p>and you can just be there forever.</p>
<p>And not everybody&rsquo;s in that position.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAn endowment could be in that position,</p>
<p>but individuals with&hellip;</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, an endowment is not</p>
<p>because they have to create</p>
<p>distributions every year, right?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, I&rsquo;m talking about the mega-endowments</p>
<p>where they, you know,</p>
<p>Ford or Harvard may not need to do this.</p>
<p>But yeah, smaller ones</p>
<p>might actually be operating,</p>
<p>you know, Memorial Sloan Kettering</p>
<p>might actually be operating</p>
<p>their budget from it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYeah, but just to go back to David&rsquo;s point,</p>
<p>like, it&rsquo;s a really difficult spot.</p>
<p>Like, what is the Fed supposed to do?</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re probably going to tighten</p>
<p>50 basis points in May.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s relatively well expected.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be able to digest that reasonably well.</p>
<p>But what do they say to David&rsquo;s point?</p>
<p>You know, if they all of a sudden go on</p>
<p>a crazy program of quantitative tightening,</p>
<p>right, and what is that again?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when, you know,</p>
<p>we were spending,</p>
<p>they were spending,</p>
<p>they were printing,</p>
<p>you know&hellip; ‚ÄìMoney.</p>
<p>‚Äì&hellip;billions and billions of dollars</p>
<p>going into the market,</p>
<p>buying securities</p>
<p>and giving people the money, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called quantitative easing.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re doing the opposite,</p>
<p>right, where they&rsquo;re selling</p>
<p>and they want the money back.</p>
<p>Now, the problem is what that does</p>
<p>is that removes liquidity from the market.</p>
<p>And when you remove liquidity</p>
<p>from a market,</p>
<p>you actually make it</p>
<p>a little bit more fragile,</p>
<p>a little bit more precarious,</p>
<p>a little bit more price sensitive.</p>
<p>And so it puts us</p>
<p>in a very tough situation</p>
<p>when the economy is slowing,</p>
<p>when these guys may be raising rates,</p>
<p>and then at the same time</p>
<p>removing money from the system,</p>
<p>it may be a lot for all of us to handle.</p>
<p>And so I think that they&rsquo;re under</p>
<p>a really difficult set of decisions.</p>
<p>There is a business cycle,</p>
<p>and, you know,</p>
<p>there are always recessions periodically</p>
<p>every seven to 10 years,</p>
<p>but they have really magnified this</p>
<p>because you had the Fed for years</p>
<p>maintaining interest rates really too low</p>
<p>and doing quantitative easing during a boom.</p>
<p>And then the federal government</p>
<p>was printing trillions</p>
<p>and trillions of dollars,</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t stop.</p>
<p>It was one thing to do it</p>
<p>during that sort of COVID recession.</p>
<p>But then last year,</p>
<p>they printed that last two trillion,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what set off</p>
<p>this wave of inflation.</p>
<p>So, you know,</p>
<p>when I was like in school</p>
<p>learning about economics</p>
<p>and they would tell us</p>
<p>that all these government programs</p>
<p>and actions are like</p>
<p>automatic stabilizers</p>
<p>or what have you,</p>
<p>like the government helps</p>
<p>balance out the business cycle.</p>
<p>No, the government</p>
<p>like magnifies the business cycle.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve made this so much worse.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re putting their hand</p>
<p>on the steering wheel, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, let the economy drive,</p>
<p>let the free market do this.</p>
<p>And if you start,</p>
<p>you know, you might oversteer</p>
<p>The federal government is great</p>
<p>at setting incentives, right?</p>
<p>And creating like tax credit programs</p>
<p>and incentives for private enterprise</p>
<p>to invest money.</p>
<p>But when they act</p>
<p>as a direct market participant</p>
<p>and start to actually direct capital flows</p>
<p>and make decisions</p>
<p>about how the capital market should work,</p>
<p>it never ends well,</p>
<p>because this is not what they&rsquo;re good at.</p>
<p>Well, I think there&rsquo;s also another,</p>
<p>I mean, just to counter that,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also this other issue</p>
<p>of not just incentives,</p>
<p>but when they create a free capital</p>
<p>that then allows a market</p>
<p>to find a way to take advantage</p>
<p>of that free capital.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s effectively</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;ve seen happen</p>
<p>with Medicare, Medicaid,</p>
<p>as well as with the student loan program.</p>
<p>And, you know, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re going to get</p>
<p>to the student loan program today.</p>
<p>But I think, you know,</p>
<p>to your point, Chamath,</p>
<p>one of the things that&rsquo;s happened</p>
<p>with the cost of education</p>
<p>in this country</p>
<p>is that the federal program,</p>
<p>which was, you know,</p>
<p>and I took a bunch of notes here</p>
<p>to talk about this today.</p>
<p>But the federal government</p>
<p>began guaranteeing student loans in 1965.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the Federal Family Education</p>
<p>Loan Program.</p>
<p>And that program made capital available</p>
<p>for students to borrow,</p>
<p>to spend on universities</p>
<p>or whatever education</p>
<p>they want to go get</p>
<p>of their own choice.</p>
<p>And the idea being that</p>
<p>that will give them the ability</p>
<p>to go make more income</p>
<p>and extend their careers</p>
<p>and educate the workforce.</p>
<p>And the problem is that</p>
<p>when that capital was made available,</p>
<p>a lot of private universities</p>
<p>started to emerge</p>
<p>and private for-profit colleges</p>
<p>started to emerge.</p>
<p>And in the years</p>
<p>since that program was introduced,</p>
<p>I just want to give you guys</p>
<p>some crazy statistics.</p>
<p>So in the 1969-70 era,</p>
<p>the cost for a public four-year college</p>
<p>was 1200 bucks a year.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s room, board, tuition and fees.</p>
<p>And in 2020,</p>
<p>that cost rose to $21,000.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the other crazy stat</p>
<p>for private four-year college</p>
<p>in 1970, 2500 a year.</p>
<p>2019-2020, $46,000 a year.</p>
<p>And so that capital basically allowed</p>
<p>these for-profit organizations</p>
<p>or these organizations</p>
<p>that are trying to grow their endowments,</p>
<p>which are effectively like for-profits,</p>
<p>to charge any price they wanted.</p>
<p>And the consumer, the student,</p>
<p>would be able to get free capital</p>
<p>to fund that quote-unquote education</p>
<p>because it was available to them for free</p>
<p>from the federal government.</p>
<p>And so the federal government</p>
<p>created a bubble in education cost.</p>
<p>And that bubble in education cost</p>
<p>has now overburdened 15%</p>
<p>of American adults with student loans,</p>
<p>that many of which would,</p>
<p>they would never be able to pay back.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re in this really awkward situation</p>
<p>of saying,</p>
<p>hey, maybe we should forgive those loans</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s unfair</p>
<p>that people are burdened by this.</p>
<p>And doing so obviously</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t solve the fundamental problem,</p>
<p>which is that making those loans available</p>
<p>in the first place</p>
<p>creates an inflationary bubble effect</p>
<p>in the end asset.</p>
<p>And the end asset in this case is education.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve seen the same thing with housing.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve seen the same thing</p>
<p>with pharmaceutical drugs</p>
<p>and medical care and other services.</p>
<p>So any place where the federal government</p>
<p>steps in and says,</p>
<p>I will provide a backstop,</p>
<p>I will provide free capital</p>
<p>to support and create a quote-unquote</p>
<p>incentive for this market to accelerate,</p>
<p>you end up with these inflationary bubble.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have people game the system,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>You get whatever University of Phoenix types</p>
<p>and even the large universities</p>
<p>raising tuition to observe things.</p>
<p>And people take these loans, Chamath,</p>
<p>before their frontal lobes</p>
<p>are even fully developed.</p>
<p>And they have long-term understanding</p>
<p>of the ramifications of this.</p>
<p>So where do you stand on this, Chamath?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an interesting article</p>
<p>in The Atlantic about who really wins</p>
<p>when you forgive student loan debt.</p>
<p>And I just pulled out some facts.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just going to look down here</p>
<p>and read them just so I get them right.</p>
<p>It said in the article,</p>
<p>13% of the US population</p>
<p>carries federal student loan debt.</p>
<p>Grad students account for 37%</p>
<p>of that federal student loan dollars.</p>
<p>Currently, it&rsquo;s $1.6 trillion</p>
<p>of total student debt</p>
<p>versus about $10 trillion</p>
<p>of mortgage debt.</p>
<p>So the average debt has gone</p>
<p>from about $25k in 2012</p>
<p>to $37k in 2022.</p>
<p>So, you know,</p>
<p>almost a 50% increase in a decade.</p>
<p>The majority of student debt</p>
<p>is held by white borrowers.</p>
<p>Only 23% of Black Americans</p>
<p>age 24 or greater</p>
<p>have a college degree in 2019.</p>
<p>So the majority of the Black population</p>
<p>would not be directly benefited</p>
<p>by student loan forgiveness.</p>
<p>In 2020, the median weekly earnings</p>
<p>for someone without a high school diploma</p>
<p>was $619.</p>
<p>For those with some college</p>
<p>but no degree,</p>
<p>that number was $877.</p>
<p>For those with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree,</p>
<p>it was $1,305.</p>
<p>And that number continues to grow</p>
<p>for master&rsquo;s and professional degrees</p>
<p>and PhDs.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the last two points,</p>
<p>the Gallup organization</p>
<p>who ran a poll</p>
<p>is unable</p>
<p>to report the percentage of Americans</p>
<p>who have mentioned student debt</p>
<p>or student debt cancellation</p>
<p>because it hasn&rsquo;t garnered</p>
<p>enough mentions to do so.</p>
<p>In 2022, according to the article,</p>
<p>across four Gallup polls,</p>
<p>just one respondent</p>
<p>mentioned student debt</p>
<p>as the most important problem</p>
<p>facing the nation, unquote.</p>
<p>And then last thing is here</p>
<p>is that 43%</p>
<p>of the 2020 Biden electorate</p>
<p>graduated from a four-year college</p>
<p>or university</p>
<p>versus 36% of Democrats in 2012.</p>
<p>So, you know,</p>
<p>one of the takeaways is that</p>
<p>this may be an issue</p>
<p>that affects</p>
<p>a certain percentage of the Dems</p>
<p>who went to college,</p>
<p>but it may not represent</p>
<p>a plurality of all Democrats</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t represent,</p>
<p>you know, a majority of all Americans.</p>
<p>They sure are vocal though</p>
<p>to your point, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, look, this is,</p>
<p>I think that there are two motivations,</p>
<p>political motivations</p>
<p>for doing this now.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re pretty obvious.</p>
<p>And then I just want to say three things</p>
<p>on kind of the concern about this</p>
<p>and why I feel very strongly</p>
<p>that if we don&rsquo;t fix</p>
<p>the underlying system,</p>
<p>you cannot forgive student loans.</p>
<p>You have to fix the system</p>
<p>before forgiving student loans.</p>
<p>Fix it first.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the number one fix, Friedman?</p>
<p>Well, so let me just say</p>
<p>the two motivations.</p>
<p>The two motivations, number one,</p>
<p>this is a stimulus.</p>
<p>So this morning,</p>
<p>the Biden administration said</p>
<p>that they were thinking</p>
<p>about taking executive action</p>
<p>to make the first $10,000</p>
<p>of student loans forgiven.</p>
<p>So if you do the math</p>
<p>across 43 million people,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a roughly half trillion dollar</p>
<p>forgiveness.</p>
<p>What happens?</p>
<p>That half trillion dollars,</p>
<p>much like we saw last year,</p>
<p>becomes a stimulus payment.</p>
<p>It is money that people now have</p>
<p>that they didn&rsquo;t have before.</p>
<p>It is capital that they</p>
<p>or freedom from debt</p>
<p>that they didn&rsquo;t have before.</p>
<p>And it will stimulate the economy.</p>
<p>So there is a very</p>
<p>important economic incentive</p>
<p>here to do this,</p>
<p>which is if we do it,</p>
<p>it will be stimulating to the economy.</p>
<p>And people will spend more</p>
<p>and the economy will grow.</p>
<p>By the way, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a two and a half percent</p>
<p>boost to GDP, right?</p>
<p>So half a trillion dollars</p>
<p>of free money just flushes</p>
<p>into the system.</p>
<p>The second thing is</p>
<p>that it will help in the midterms</p>
<p>is their point of view, right?</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve obviously done</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve done the polling here,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, hey,</p>
<p>when I was in junior high,</p>
<p>the kid that ran for class president</p>
<p>was like, I&rsquo;m going to make everything</p>
<p>in a vending machine free.</p>
<p>Guess what?</p>
<p>That kid got voted in.</p>
<p>So, you know, the idea that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just going to give everyone free,</p>
<p>give your loans back to you for free.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s like, my gosh,</p>
<p>this is the best thing ever.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Warren, you&rsquo;re a genius.</p>
<p>You know, Bernie Sanders,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a genius.</p>
<p>Joe Biden, you&rsquo;re a genius.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say yes.</p>
<p>And so they believe through polling</p>
<p>that this is going to help</p>
<p>them in the midterms.</p>
<p>But the challenge is,</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t solve the problem,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s no standard of value,</p>
<p>of an education,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s no standard around</p>
<p>whether or not a specific</p>
<p>accredited university</p>
<p>increases your income</p>
<p>and earning potential as an individual,</p>
<p>or increases the opportunity</p>
<p>for you as an individual,</p>
<p>you are wasting money.</p>
<p>You are giving federal dollars</p>
<p>to private companies</p>
<p>who are profiteering from that,</p>
<p>and the individuals</p>
<p>are not going to benefit from it.</p>
<p>And I think that we&rsquo;re seeing this,</p>
<p>sorry, and we&rsquo;re seeing this</p>
<p>structurally continue</p>
<p>in a lot of other places</p>
<p>where the federal government</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t hold itself accountable</p>
<p>to the standards of how their stimulus</p>
<p>is meant to benefit the individuals</p>
<p>that it is being funded for.</p>
<p>The individuals are not getting</p>
<p>a good education in many cases.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not earning more</p>
<p>by getting this education.</p>
<p>Chamath&rsquo;s data speaks to the average,</p>
<p>but a large percentage of people</p>
<p>go to crappy universities</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t improve</p>
<p>their earnings potential.</p>
<p>And then the federal government says,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s this free money,</p>
<p>that private university</p>
<p>just made a bunch of money,</p>
<p>and no one&rsquo;s better off.</p>
<p>And guess who&rsquo;s ended up paying for it?</p>
<p>Taxpayers are going to end up paying</p>
<p>that private company a bunch of money</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re going to forgive</p>
<p>all the loans.</p>
<p>And so we have to have a standard around</p>
<p>whether or not a dollar</p>
<p>should be loaned to pay for education</p>
<p>at a specific university</p>
<p>by having that university prove</p>
<p>that it improves the potential.</p>
<p>And by the way, if you stop</p>
<p>the federal student loan program today,</p>
<p>fewer people would go to college.</p>
<p>And if fewer people went to college,</p>
<p>guess what would happen?</p>
<p>Colleges would drop their tuition.</p>
<p>The reason they&rsquo;re able to raise demand,</p>
<p>supply and demand,</p>
<p>and the reason they&rsquo;re able</p>
<p>to raise their tuition</p>
<p>is because there&rsquo;s so much demand</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s free money.</p>
<p>And so if we actually saw</p>
<p>the federal loan program cut back</p>
<p>or put these standards in place,</p>
<p>the cost of tuition</p>
<p>would actually decline.</p>
<p>And profiteering would decline.</p>
<p>People would get a better education</p>
<p>and the taxpayers would be better off.</p>
<p>End of diatribe.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>No, no, I think it&rsquo;s completely legitimate,</p>
<p>Saks.</p>
<p>We talked on a previous episode</p>
<p>about how people make</p>
<p>things like immigration,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>such a charged philosophical debate</p>
<p>when there are point based systems</p>
<p>being used in Canada,</p>
<p>Australia and other places</p>
<p>that make it much more logical.</p>
<p>Do you think the solution here</p>
<p>is to Freeberg&rsquo;s point</p>
<p>of just,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m interpreting Freeberg&rsquo;s point as</p>
<p>what is the value of this degree?</p>
<p>Nursing?</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Nurses can take out 100% of their loans</p>
<p>because we know there&rsquo;s a nursing shortage.</p>
<p>You know, philosophy,</p>
<p>graduate students</p>
<p>maybe can&rsquo;t take out</p>
<p>more than $5,000 in debt</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see a bunch of job openings for that.</p>
<p>Getting a history degree</p>
<p>at Trump University</p>
<p>is a lot different</p>
<p>than getting a nursing degree.</p>
<p>So Saks,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the solution here?</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll give you</p>
<p>your swing at bat</p>
<p>in terms of buying votes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go solution first</p>
<p>before we go partisan.</p>
<p>Look, I think that a loan</p>
<p>only makes sense</p>
<p>when it generates ROI, right?</p>
<p>It makes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to generate more income</p>
<p>on the other side of that loan</p>
<p>to make that loan worthwhile.</p>
<p>And the problem here</p>
<p>in too many cases</p>
<p>is these kids go to these schools,</p>
<p>they spend five years there,</p>
<p>they get a degree</p>
<p>in some woke nonsense.</p>
<p>And of course,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t help their earnings power.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a fundamental issue here</p>
<p>is that these degrees</p>
<p>are worthless, right?</p>
<p>I mean, if you go to college</p>
<p>to get, you know,</p>
<p>to become a doctor</p>
<p>or maybe a computer programmer</p>
<p>or something</p>
<p>where the skills have value,</p>
<p>then of course,</p>
<p>you can pay back the loan</p>
<p>because you get a gainful job.</p>
<p>But otherwise,</p>
<p>if you just major in fine arts at Harvard</p>
<p>or something like that,</p>
<p>I mean, you basically graduate,</p>
<p>you get a job at what?</p>
<p>The New York Times is your dream.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t pay back your loan.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saddled with this enormous debt.</p>
<p>And think about</p>
<p>the cultural impact that has.</p>
<p>You have this young generation</p>
<p>who believes in socialism.</p>
<p>And I think this is a big part</p>
<p>of the reason why</p>
<p>is they have no capital</p>
<p>and they have no ability</p>
<p>to accumulate capital</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re so saddled with debt.</p>
<p>So to interpret what you said,</p>
<p>Saks, hard to believe in capitalism</p>
<p>if you got no capital,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>If you start,</p>
<p>if you start the race</p>
<p>at negative $250,000 in debt</p>
<p>to get a degree</p>
<p>that was basically worthless for you.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the system is cool.</p>
<p>I think maybe what we do</p>
<p>is we reform the debt.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d actually be OK with</p>
<p>forgiving the debt in some instances</p>
<p>if you got a reform of the system.</p>
<p>In other words,</p>
<p>if we stop funding</p>
<p>these worthless degrees,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re basically</p>
<p>going to acknowledge that,</p>
<p>hey, we need debt forgiveness</p>
<p>because these degrees are worthless.</p>
<p>Why would you keep funding those degrees?</p>
<p>So, you know, we need to have</p>
<p>like a more honest,</p>
<p>comprehensive solution here.</p>
<p>The other thing we should do actually</p>
<p>is one really crazy</p>
<p>part of bankruptcy law</p>
<p>is that student debt</p>
<p>is one of the only types of debt</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not dischargeable in bankruptcy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you guys know that,</p>
<p>but under George W. Bush&rsquo;s presidency-</p>
<p>Yeah, explain it to everybody.</p>
<p>Yeah, basically, look,</p>
<p>if you ever get to the point</p>
<p>where you have too much debt</p>
<p>and you can never pay it back,</p>
<p>you declare bankruptcy</p>
<p>and then the court starts you over from zero.</p>
<p>So you can at least</p>
<p>start building some wealth, right?</p>
<p>But you lose credit, but you lose credit.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s going to want to</p>
<p>give you credit after that,</p>
<p>but at least you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>so deep in the hole</p>
<p>you can never recover.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the point of</p>
<p>personal bankruptcy.</p>
<p>But the crazy thing is that</p>
<p>in bankruptcy,</p>
<p>you cannot get your college debt,</p>
<p>your student debt canceled.</p>
<p>You can get your credit card debt canceled.</p>
<p>You can get other types of debt canceled.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t get your student loans canceled.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one thing</p>
<p>they should fix immediately</p>
<p>is make these debts dischargeable-</p>
<p>If it was private market sacks,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t need to do that, right?</p>
<p>The reason that&rsquo;s the case</p>
<p>is because it&rsquo;s federal dollars</p>
<p>that are funding those loans.</p>
<p>But if it was private market dollars,</p>
<p>people actually,</p>
<p>if banks and lenders took a loss</p>
<p>when people couldn&rsquo;t pay back the loans,</p>
<p>then the market would work itself out.</p>
<p>The problem is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the federal government stepping in</p>
<p>and trying to be a market maker.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And it creates this totally crazy incentive.</p>
<p>Right. It creates double distortions.</p>
<p>On the one hand, like you said,</p>
<p>it basically means that</p>
<p>because government money is funding everything,</p>
<p>the tuition goes up</p>
<p>because colleges take advantage of it.</p>
<p>But then also,</p>
<p>nobody&rsquo;s really making a smart ROI decision</p>
<p>about whether-</p>
<p>a smart underwriting decision</p>
<p>about whether this loan is worth making,</p>
<p>whether it actually stands</p>
<p>a reasonable shot of being paid back.</p>
<p>There is such an easy free market solution here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called an ISA.</p>
<p>It stands for Income Sharing Agreement.</p>
<p>This is where you give a loan to somebody</p>
<p>and you get a percentage of their income</p>
<p>over a period of time</p>
<p>capped at a certain multiple,</p>
<p>say 2x.</p>
<p>And what this does is</p>
<p>it aligns the person giving the loan</p>
<p>with the job that&rsquo;s expected to come</p>
<p>from the education.</p>
<p>You already have that.</p>
<p>You already have that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called taxes.</p>
<p>Yeah, but here&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s watching the store.</p>
<p>So nobody&rsquo;s looking at it saying,</p>
<p>I will give an ISA</p>
<p>at this percentage return for nursing.</p>
<p>Nursing happens to-</p>
<p>I gotta pay 50% of my income every year</p>
<p>to the federal go-</p>
<p>to the government.</p>
<p>Like, I pay taxes.</p>
<p>The thing we have to remember is like,</p>
<p>if the federal government tries to do this,</p>
<p>it really is just about buying votes</p>
<p>going into a midterm election.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>If you arbitrarily give a bailout</p>
<p>of one sliver of the population,</p>
<p>unless that sliver is really, really large,</p>
<p>which we know it is not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to really anger everybody else.</p>
<p>Think of all the people</p>
<p>that are tradespeople,</p>
<p>working class people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t have a college degree.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What are they going to think?</p>
<p>What about all the people</p>
<p>that just finished paying off their debt?</p>
<p>What are they going to think?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to upset so many people.</p>
<p>And ultimately what this is</p>
<p>is a bunch of coastal elites</p>
<p>who are miscast in jobs</p>
<p>and saddled with debt</p>
<p>is pushing for a program</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t a broad-based mechanism</p>
<p>to create equality at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a get-out-of-jail-free card</p>
<p>for a small group of people</p>
<p>who unfortunately</p>
<p>were taken advantage of.</p>
<p>And this is the thing</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re losing sight of.</p>
<p>You can only pay back a loan</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re making more money than you owe.</p>
<p>And the fact that this exists</p>
<p>shows that these loans</p>
<p>were really poorly constructed</p>
<p>and they were given in instances</p>
<p>where they should not have been.</p>
<p>In the private markets,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen that happen,</p>
<p>but we go through a cleansing mechanism</p>
<p>to sort it out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s literally what happened</p>
<p>during the 2008 real estate bubble.</p>
<p>People gave mortgages to people</p>
<p>who could not pay them back.</p>
<p>If I, as a lender,</p>
<p>think that you&rsquo;re not going to be able</p>
<p>to pay back the loan,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give you the loan.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the simple mechanism</p>
<p>that exists in free markets.</p>
<p>And part of the issue</p>
<p>is a lot of people got loans</p>
<p>thinking without doing the calculation,</p>
<p>will I ever be able to pay this back?</p>
<p>And they took the loan</p>
<p>to get an education.</p>
<p>The other binary concept</p>
<p>that I will just make money,</p>
<p>but let me ask one other question of you guys.</p>
<p>At what age and at what level</p>
<p>do you think individuals</p>
<p>should take responsibility</p>
<p>for the decisions that they&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>when they take on personal debt?</p>
<p>Because we see ourselves</p>
<p>getting in the cycle</p>
<p>where consumers are given debt.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t think about</p>
<p>the consequences of that debt down the road</p>
<p>or do the analysis themselves.</p>
<p>And maybe they&rsquo;re not equipped to.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll take out a loan on a car,</p>
<p>on a house,</p>
<p>on a&hellip;</p>
<p>No, but the problem is&hellip;</p>
<p>And on a loan, on an education.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing,</p>
<p>like education is a very dangerous thing</p>
<p>because we put so much societal credit</p>
<p>and external signaling to it.</p>
<p>And we give everyone effectively</p>
<p>the same quantum of risk.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not true for a credit card,</p>
<p>nor is it true for a car loan.</p>
<p>So the private markets are efficient</p>
<p>in that when you first</p>
<p>try to get a credit card.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get an Amex,</p>
<p>Centurion or Platinum card.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re given a Chase Sapphire card</p>
<p>with a $500 limit.</p>
<p>And you earn the right to borrow more.</p>
<p>Same if you applied for a car loan.</p>
<p>The same with a mortgage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s based on a down payment.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s differential risk pricing.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>differential risk pricing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting a lot of people&hellip;</p>
<p>How would you add it to education?</p>
<p>The market would figure it out.</p>
<p>The market would</p>
<p>because you would</p>
<p>differentially price the risk.</p>
<p>As you guys&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re literally a brainstormer right now.</p>
<p>Like, what are your grades?</p>
<p>Well, no&hellip;</p>
<p>What courses did you take?</p>
<p>Whatever it is.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to get it right.</p>
<p>The market will get it right.</p>
<p>But the market would figure it out.</p>
<p>The problem is&hellip;</p>
<p>Sorry, the incentive was&hellip;</p>
<p>And this is a really important point.</p>
<p>If you guys read Ray Dalio&rsquo;s book,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ve talked about a number of times,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s identified and highlighted</p>
<p>that a growing economy</p>
<p>in a successful country</p>
<p>improves by improving education</p>
<p>and having more people</p>
<p>get higher education,</p>
<p>generally speaking.</p>
<p>And so the initial incentive,</p>
<p>the initial intention</p>
<p>behind the Federal Student Loan Program</p>
<p>was a good one,</p>
<p>which was to give people</p>
<p>access to capital</p>
<p>that the private markets</p>
<p>were not providing at the time</p>
<p>so that they could go out</p>
<p>and get a higher education.</p>
<p>We could improve</p>
<p>the education of our workforce</p>
<p>and we could grow our economy.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the question</p>
<p>that we always forget&hellip;</p>
<p>Remember, we always get one step away</p>
<p>and then two steps away</p>
<p>and five steps away</p>
<p>and we miss the point.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in that moment now</p>
<p>where the question really is,</p>
<p>is the Federal Student Loan Program</p>
<p>doing more harm than good?</p>
<p>Are we actually creating value</p>
<p>from our higher education system</p>
<p>in this country or not?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, but most importantly,</p>
<p>is the private market there?</p>
<p>Because you look at the total debt outstanding,</p>
<p>$1.7 trillion.</p>
<p>There would be a private debt market.</p>
<p>Freeberg, don&rsquo;t sell beyond the clothes.</p>
<p>The answer is no.</p>
<p>We have a massive employment gap, okay?</p>
<p>The data tells you</p>
<p>in every single which way possible</p>
<p>that we are not educating</p>
<p>our young people</p>
<p>to take the jobs that are needed</p>
<p>for a high growth,</p>
<p>functionally moving economy.</p>
<p>We know that.</p>
<p>So we are miseducating these folks</p>
<p>and then we are giving them</p>
<p>access to enormous amounts of debt</p>
<p>that they have no reasonable chance</p>
<p>to pay back.</p>
<p>And I think that that should be fixed</p>
<p>by fixing the incentives</p>
<p>of the universities.</p>
<p>You are right.</p>
<p>Universities today</p>
<p>are for profit,</p>
<p>asset management businesses</p>
<p>wrapped by this philanthropic</p>
<p>do good or nonsense</p>
<p>that they try to tell people</p>
<p>to get you to go there</p>
<p>and pay $50,000 a year in tuition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a joke.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re compelling people</p>
<p>to think that these degrees</p>
<p>are actually going to make them</p>
<p>successful humans.</p>
<p>They come out miseducated</p>
<p>and undereducated</p>
<p>and incapable of servicing</p>
<p>the economy&rsquo;s needs separately.</p>
<p>The other thing,</p>
<p>if you take a step back</p>
<p>and take student loan</p>
<p>off the table for a second</p>
<p>and just say</p>
<p>any consumer handout</p>
<p>that touches less than,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>40 or 50% of the economy</p>
<p>or of the population of a country</p>
<p>is very precarious.</p>
<p>So student debt,</p>
<p>in this case,</p>
<p>15% of the US population.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of people.</p>
<p>But it also means that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s 85% who don&rsquo;t benefit.</p>
<p>What will those 85% of the people</p>
<p>say when they have to foot the bill</p>
<p>for the first 15%?</p>
<p>And then what do you think happens</p>
<p>with other kinds of debt?</p>
<p>What happens when the oil lobby says,</p>
<p>forgive our debt</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re in a national energy crisis?</p>
<p>What will all the climate folks</p>
<p>think about that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no accountability.</p>
<p>Well, it creates a slippery slope.</p>
<p>And my last point on this is,</p>
<p>to the extent that we actually want</p>
<p>to forgive student debt,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fine if that&rsquo;s the law of the land.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>It should go to the floor,</p>
<p>and it should be debated in Congress,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a law that should be passed.</p>
<p>But it should not be by executive edict</p>
<p>trying to back in to buying votes</p>
<p>in a midterm election.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gross.</p>
<p>Saxe.</p>
<p>Well, by the way,</p>
<p>just on the politics of that,</p>
<p>I think this could potentially hurt them</p>
<p>because, Jamal, to your point,</p>
<p>this is basically a bailout</p>
<p>of the woke professional class.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the underemployed graduates</p>
<p>of these universities who, again,</p>
<p>are members of the professional class.</p>
<p>They majored in things</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t increase their earnings potential.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the majority of the country</p>
<p>is working class.</p>
<p>Something like two-thirds of the country</p>
<p>is still working class,</p>
<p>meaning non-college educated.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re going to have to pay</p>
<p>for this bailout.</p>
<p>And one way or another,</p>
<p>either through higher taxes</p>
<p>or more deficit spending or more debt,</p>
<p>the burden of this bailout</p>
<p>is going to fall on them.</p>
<p>And why should they have to pay</p>
<p>to bail out the professional class?</p>
<p>Clearly, somebody working in retail</p>
<p>is paying for somebody&rsquo;s graduate school degree</p>
<p>in creative writing or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely and profoundly unfair.</p>
<p>To the answer to Freiburg&rsquo;s question,</p>
<p>we actually know when executive function</p>
<p>fully matures in adults,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 25 years old.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when you can actually</p>
<p>make long-term thinking.</p>
<p>So there is an argument</p>
<p>that people should not be allowed</p>
<p>to take these loans</p>
<p>that are not even,</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t get out of.</p>
<p>Or there should be some cap</p>
<p>on the amount of loans you can take</p>
<p>because people at the age of 17, 18, 19, 20</p>
<p>are absolutely not able</p>
<p>to make these decisions.</p>
<p>There are other programs as well that work.</p>
<p>So in Canada,</p>
<p>I went to a school called</p>
<p>the University of Waterloo.</p>
<p>Fantastic engineering school.</p>
<p>The reason I went there</p>
<p>and I did electrical engineering there</p>
<p>is that they had a program</p>
<p>where after the first year,</p>
<p>so the first year looks like every other year</p>
<p>at every other school, okay?</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re there for two semesters</p>
<p>from September to May.</p>
<p>But after that, you start working</p>
<p>and you alternate four months of work</p>
<p>with four months of school.</p>
<p>And you get paid for that work.</p>
<p>And what it allowed me to do</p>
<p>was graduate with meaningfully less debt,</p>
<p>but it also allowed me to graduate</p>
<p>with a commercial skill set.</p>
<p>And I was able to get a job.</p>
<p>And in that moment, actually,</p>
<p>I was working at a bank</p>
<p>and I got profoundly lucky,</p>
<p>which is I worked for an individual</p>
<p>and I was trading interest rate derivatives</p>
<p>and I was learning to trade</p>
<p>technology stocks on the side.</p>
<p>And this guy, Mike Fisher,</p>
<p>incredible human being.</p>
<p>And I made in one year,</p>
<p>like $25,000 or $30,000 for him.</p>
<p>Yum, yum. Zip, zip.</p>
<p>He wrote me a check and he said,</p>
<p>here, you have $25,000 of student debt.</p>
<p>Go pay it off right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let you cash out this whole book.</p>
<p>I graduated with about $28,000 of debt.</p>
<p>I had about $8,000, I think.</p>
<p>I had somewhere between $10,000 and $15,000,</p>
<p>$10,000 and $20,000.</p>
<p>And then I got my first bonus check</p>
<p>after my first year of work after undergrad.</p>
<p>And I paid off all my debt</p>
<p>and it felt incredible.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>It was amazing.</p>
<p>When I paid off my debt,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been in debt since.</p>
<p>I walked downstairs to the bank</p>
<p>and I gave them the check and I endorsed it.</p>
<p>And I said, here&rsquo;s my student loan number.</p>
<p>And I was like, oh my God, I was free.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it was an enormous sense of relief.</p>
<p>For me, it was credit card debt.</p>
<p>I had accumulated all the credit card</p>
<p>because I went to Cal.</p>
<p>It was like four grand a year to go to college.</p>
<p>It was a lot cheaper back then.</p>
<p>If I didn&rsquo;t go to Waterloo,</p>
<p>I would have had double the debt</p>
<p>because I wouldn&rsquo;t have had work.</p>
<p>But then also, like I think about all these scenarios,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have had two years of work experience.</p>
<p>I may not have gotten the job</p>
<p>that I did at Bank of Montreal at the time.</p>
<p>That may not have been able to</p>
<p>give me a chance to meet Mike Fisher.</p>
<p>Hey, all these things could have happened.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t rely on the luck of the butterfly effect</p>
<p>so that you have a reasonable shot</p>
<p>of building a good life, right?</p>
<p>So there are all these things in universities</p>
<p>that I think are really mismanaged today.</p>
<p>And they go and work against</p>
<p>what is right in society.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll give you another example.</p>
<p>The dean of the engineering school</p>
<p>and the president of University of Waterloo</p>
<p>was here this week with me.</p>
<p>And I asked them,</p>
<p>tell me about these global rankings.</p>
<p>And they said, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a really difficult game.</p>
<p>They said, if we wanted to compete</p>
<p>to try to get high on the list,</p>
<p>we would have to do the things</p>
<p>that would undo all the things</p>
<p>that made us great and unique in the first place.</p>
<p>And I was like, you know what?</p>
<p>I am such a huge supporter of this school.</p>
<p>Please just continue to do what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m so proud that they have the strength</p>
<p>to just stand on their own two feet.</p>
<p>But every other school is running this shell game</p>
<p>of, you know, gerrymandering all of these statistics,</p>
<p>trying to get high on the list,</p>
<p>to trick some parent,</p>
<p>to force their kid to go to some school,</p>
<p>to then graduate with $200,000 of debt,</p>
<p>to get a job that doesn&rsquo;t then give them</p>
<p>any line of sight to paying it off.</p>
<p>It is, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s their kids&rsquo; fault,</p>
<p>but you have to reform the system.</p>
<p>And I think the first thing you need to do</p>
<p>is look inside these universities</p>
<p>and hold these folks accountable.</p>
<p>I mean, these incentive systems are just crazy.</p>
<p>Speaking about crazy,</p>
<p>we talked about Bill Hwang and his-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your transition?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your transition?</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t all be as elegant and smooth.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Jekyll.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s looking at the agenda for today</p>
<p>and he sees Bill Hwang and he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>okay, how do I do this?</p>
<p>How do I do this?</p>
<p>The Hwang-er.</p>
<p>The Hwang-er.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, he pulled the Hwang.</p>
<p>Crazy, the linkage is craziness.</p>
<p>Okay, go.</p>
<p>I mean-</p>
<p>No, no, no, hold on.</p>
<p>The linkage is trillions and billions.</p>
<p>Trillions and billions.</p>
<p>Speaking of trillions and billions-</p>
<p>Speaking of trillion dollar mistakes,</p>
<p>we got a-</p>
<p>Hwang and his CFO were arrested on Wednesday</p>
<p>and charged with racketeering,</p>
<p>wire fraud, and conspiracy.</p>
<p>We talked about this when it happened.</p>
<p>His firm, Archegos,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s Archegos.</p>
<p>Archegos, Archegos.</p>
<p>Archegos.</p>
<p>His poorly named firm and family office,</p>
<p>we covered this in real time</p>
<p>back on episode 28,</p>
<p>they famously lost $20 billion over two days</p>
<p>when they were margin called</p>
<p>back in March of 2021.</p>
<p>He worked at Tiger Management, yada, yada.</p>
<p>And it was at the time reported</p>
<p>that they were trading billions of dollars</p>
<p>at over 5x leverage.</p>
<p>According to the SEC complaint,</p>
<p>at its peak, the firm was managing $36 billion</p>
<p>with $160 billion of exposure,</p>
<p>which is 4.5x leverage.</p>
<p>But Archegos, or however it&rsquo;s pronounced,</p>
<p>started with only $1.5 billion in assets</p>
<p>in March of 2020.</p>
<p>So Hwang flipped $1.5 billion in capital</p>
<p>into $160 billion of exposure in 12 months,</p>
<p>essentially trading somewhere</p>
<p>in the neighborhood of $100 to $1 at its peak,</p>
<p>according to this complaint.</p>
<p>A bunch of banks have lost money</p>
<p>because they were supporting this.</p>
<p>Credit Suisse lost $5.5 billion,</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley lost $1 billion,</p>
<p>UBS, $774 million.</p>
<p>The New York Times described it as,</p>
<p>quote,</p>
<p>orchestrating a stock manipulation scheme</p>
<p>that relied on them masking</p>
<p>and concealing the enormous risk they had taken.</p>
<p>Chamath, you had some thoughts on this, I think.</p>
<p>So first, I think we should probably explain</p>
<p>how he did this, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s everybody&rsquo;s question is,</p>
<p>how did the banks let this happen?</p>
<p>Well, I think first, it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the mechanism.</p>
<p>So there are ways in capital markets</p>
<p>to take really extreme bets.</p>
<p>This way is what&rsquo;s called a total return swap.</p>
<p>And so the basic way that this works</p>
<p>is you have two people on each side of a trade.</p>
<p>And what you basically say is,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s agree on what&rsquo;s called a reference asset.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll just use an example.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I think Discovery was one of the companies</p>
<p>that they were trading.</p>
<p>So Discovery Communications.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at, that&rsquo;s the reference asset, that stock.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m going to do is buy protection.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;re going to do is sell protection.</p>
<p>And essentially what happens is,</p>
<p>as the stock goes up and down,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to net the difference</p>
<p>between these two people.</p>
<p>And when you do it that way via a derivative,</p>
<p>so what it forces the person to do,</p>
<p>the bank in this case,</p>
<p>is to go out and buy the stock, okay?</p>
<p>So that they are hedged in case the price goes up a lot</p>
<p>because they have to pay that difference,</p>
<p>in this case, to Bill Huang.</p>
<p>And if the price goes down,</p>
<p>Bill Huang has to pay that difference back to the bank.</p>
<p>So what happened is that he went to three different banks,</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and Credit Suisse,</p>
<p>and effectively what he did was he bought,</p>
<p>he made these bets across a handful of names,</p>
<p>but he did it with so much leverage</p>
<p>that he ended up owning 60 or 70% of some of these companies.</p>
<p>And in March of last year,</p>
<p>when the stock market turned over,</p>
<p>he owed them enormous amounts of money,</p>
<p>so much so that these banks had to unwind these trades,</p>
<p>which caused further downdrafts in the stock</p>
<p>and almost spilled over to the broader stock market.</p>
<p>Jason, the numbers from the SEC complaint are pretty crazy.</p>
<p>As of March 31st of 2020,</p>
<p>they had $1.6 billion invested</p>
<p>on a gross exposure of $10.2 billion,</p>
<p>which what that means is they were able to go</p>
<p>and lever up this $1.6 billion</p>
<p>to behave in the market as if they had $10.2 billion.</p>
<p>By January 1st of 2021, so nine months later,</p>
<p>they had $7.7 billion of invested capital,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;d done really well, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d made 70% on this 10 billion,</p>
<p>but they levered that up again,</p>
<p>and so they had gross exposure of $54 billion.</p>
<p>And then just, I think, three months later,</p>
<p>by March 22nd,</p>
<p>they had $36 billion of invested capital,</p>
<p>meaning they had $36 billion of cash.</p>
<p>This guy had taken 1.6 and spun it up</p>
<p>to $36 billion in basically-</p>
<p>Yum, yum, this guy went like 20x.</p>
<p>In a year, but then he had levered that up again,</p>
<p>and he had $160 billion of gross exposure.</p>
<p>And then the market turned, and he owed all this money,</p>
<p>and so all these folks had to get out of it.</p>
<p>But basically-</p>
<p>They also alleged that he was trying to do short squeezes</p>
<p>on the stocks to try to make them goose even more.</p>
<p>So there was massive manipulation</p>
<p>because of his position size, correct?</p>
<p>Yes, so this is what happened.</p>
<p>But then here&rsquo;s how it is allowed to happen.</p>
<p>So if you try to do the same thing in interest rates,</p>
<p>in the interest rates market versus the equities market,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not possible.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>If I wanted to go and buy a credit default swap,</p>
<p>effectively think of that as the same kind of thing he did,</p>
<p>but on the debt of a company,</p>
<p>on the debt of discovery.</p>
<p>What I would do is I would be able to enter</p>
<p>into that trade with a bank,</p>
<p>but it goes into a clearinghouse.</p>
<p>And that clearinghouse is able to tell all the banks</p>
<p>how much risk is building up in the system.</p>
<p>And the reason we implemented this clearinghouse</p>
<p>was to make sure coming out of the great financial crisis,</p>
<p>none of that chaos ever happened again.</p>
<p>But we did not include the equity markets</p>
<p>in that clearinghouse and in the laws that regulate it.</p>
<p>And so what this is,</p>
<p>is a very shadowy gray part of the market</p>
<p>that is poorly regulated,</p>
<p>that has very little oversight.</p>
<p>So what do the banks do?</p>
<p>The banks say to you,</p>
<p>if you want to put this thing on,</p>
<p>give me a balance sheet so I understand what the risk is.</p>
<p>A piece of paper, a report.</p>
<p>And I think what they&rsquo;re alleging</p>
<p>is that these guys lied</p>
<p>so that any individual bank,</p>
<p>in this case, Goldman, Morgan, and Credit Suisse,</p>
<p>had no idea because they kind of doctored</p>
<p>these reports to each other.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why all this risk built up in the system.</p>
<p>It would be solved if you had a clearinghouse</p>
<p>for equity derivatives,</p>
<p>the same way you have for interest rate derivatives.</p>
<p>It is crazy to think that somebody was doing this</p>
<p>and thought they would get away with it</p>
<p>and had been up 20x.</p>
<p>The psychology of these people,</p>
<p>the Madoffs of the world,</p>
<p>I just find fascinating.</p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t he if he&rsquo;d 20x?</p>
<p>We just talked, by the way,</p>
<p>we talked about how the four of us,</p>
<p>we talked about how the four of us are grinding</p>
<p>to return 2x of our money in 10 years.</p>
<p>Yes, and this guy&rsquo;s like, YOLO.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s 7x or 10x, you know, $1.6 billion.</p>
<p>And it was not enough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not enough.</p>
<p>I mean, people have,</p>
<p>but what do you think the psychology of this is?</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to figure out, Sax.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the psychology of somebody who tries to do this?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re already a billionaire.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve already got their jet.</p>
<p>They could go anywhere.</p>
<p>They could have anything.</p>
<p>They could buy any home.</p>
<p>They could go on any vacation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing I never understand about these people</p>
<p>is like, this has got to be</p>
<p>some crazy sociopathic behavior.</p>
<p>Jekyll, did you always want a jet?</p>
<p>By the way, the guy-</p>
<p>I just got a business select on Southwest.</p>
<p>When you started your career,</p>
<p>what did you want?</p>
<p>The Knicks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I still want.</p>
<p>Well, when you started, you wanted a house, right?</p>
<p>And then you got the house</p>
<p>and you wanted the home in Tahoe</p>
<p>and then you, or the home, you know, the vacation home.</p>
<p>And then, and then you want the jet.</p>
<p>And then, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know why this is confusing.</p>
<p>Well, no, but I don&rsquo;t want it enough</p>
<p>to put my entire freedom at risk or to cheat.</p>
<p>Apparently this dude was a Christian.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put that in quotes.</p>
<p>Cause I don&rsquo;t, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t sound like Christian behavior.</p>
<p>Ran, ran Bible study and stuff in the mornings.</p>
<p>He lived in some modest house in Jersey, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>But you know, he was a bit of a freaky deke.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>So weird.</p>
<p>I mean, the guy couldn&rsquo;t get enough.</p>
<p>By the way, the dude was pinched in 2012 for insider trading</p>
<p>and had to pay a settlement</p>
<p>and like give back everybody&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>He got pinched.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>It is what it is.</p>
<p>You know, you never rat on your friends.</p>
<p>The guy got pinched.</p>
<p>He got pinched.</p>
<p>Yeah, he got pinched.</p>
<p>When you grow up in the streets, you know that.</p>
<p>What happened to this guy?</p>
<p>I got pinched.</p>
<p>He got pinched.</p>
<p>When you grew up in the streets.</p>
<p>The guy ate cheese.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t rat on, he ratted on his friends.</p>
<p>Manchego, he ran out of the Manchego.</p>
<p>He tried to steal some Manchego and he ratted on his friends.</p>
<p>Now the CFO got pinched, too.</p>
<p>They flipped him.</p>
<p>This is super deranged.</p>
<p>Speaking of deranged.</p>
<p>Transitions tonight.</p>
<p>Where are we going?</p>
<p>Where are we going?</p>
<p>You know what someone needs to do?</p>
<p>Someone needs to take all of Jekyll&rsquo;s transitions</p>
<p>from the last couple of shows</p>
<p>and just put them together in a row.</p>
<p>Yeah, just a super crazy.</p>
<p>Speaking of deranged.</p>
<p>Okay, speaking of deranged.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>Speaking of billions.</p>
<p>Announced a disinformation governance board.</p>
<p>Disinformation governance board.</p>
<p>According to the announcement,</p>
<p>the board will immediately, immediately</p>
<p>begin focusing on misinformation aimed at</p>
<p>migrants at the US Mexican border.</p>
<p>The board will be led by disinformation expert</p>
<p>Nina Jankowicz.</p>
<p>Jankowicz.</p>
<p>He has researched Russian misinformation tactics</p>
<p>and online harassment.</p>
<p>This is also the woman who sings</p>
<p>show tunes on TikTok.</p>
<p>Jekyll, I feel like you should be running.</p>
<p>You should be running our disinformation board.</p>
<p>You always have such a strong opinion.</p>
<p>And you have such a nose for</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s BS and what&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on here.</p>
<p>So first of all,</p>
<p>this woman claims to be an expert in disinformation.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s evaluate that claim.</p>
<p>She was an active pusher of the Steele dossier,</p>
<p>which turns out is disinformation</p>
<p>for which people are now under indictment.</p>
<p>She also was active in trying to censor</p>
<p>the Hunter Biden laptop story,</p>
<p>which as it now turns out was not disinformation.</p>
<p>It was absolutely true,</p>
<p>as acknowledged by the New York Times,</p>
<p>the Washington Post.</p>
<p>You would think that these blemishes on her record</p>
<p>might disqualify her</p>
<p>from being an expert on disinformation,</p>
<p>but actually in the view</p>
<p>that people are hiring her,</p>
<p>these are actually qualifications</p>
<p>because they are not interested in the truth.</p>
<p>The reason this department is set up</p>
<p>and what they mean by disinformation</p>
<p>is they have hired her</p>
<p>to push partisan political points.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on here.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what disinformation is.</p>
<p>Now, it used to be</p>
<p>that if you disagreed with somebody,</p>
<p>you would just say,</p>
<p>listen, I disagree with you,</p>
<p>or maybe you&rsquo;re an idiot,</p>
<p>whatever, you&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>But now the way that these debates</p>
<p>are set up and the way they work</p>
<p>is they don&rsquo;t just say you&rsquo;re wrong,</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>They try to label you as disinformation</p>
<p>so you can get you censored.</p>
<p>And the point of hiring</p>
<p>this disinformation czar</p>
<p>is basically to censor the,</p>
<p>basically to shut down the debate.</p>
<p>That is basically the whole point</p>
<p>of the censorship.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s any timing here</p>
<p>with Elon Biden?</p>
<p>Yes, of course.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, well, there was</p>
<p>a great tweet about this.</p>
<p>I mean, I love conspiracy sacks, by the way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>There was a great tweet about this</p>
<p>that we live in a future</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like a mashup</p>
<p>of George Orwell and Ayn Rand.</p>
<p>Because here you have Elon Musk,</p>
<p>the heroic lone entrepreneur</p>
<p>trying to rescue freedom of speech.</p>
<p>At the same time,</p>
<p>you have this Orwellian ministry</p>
<p>of truth being created</p>
<p>by the federal government.</p>
<p>I mean, no awareness of naming.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just bizarre.</p>
<p>But the disturbing thing about it is-</p>
<p>Disinformation governance board</p>
<p>is such a dystopian name.</p>
<p>The thing about it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a little bit scary here.</p>
<p>I know you play the video</p>
<p>of her doing show tunes</p>
<p>and it seems sort of silly.</p>
<p>But the thing that&rsquo;s scary is</p>
<p>that this is under</p>
<p>the Homeland Security Department.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another weird wrinkle.</p>
<p>Why is that there?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most militarized department</p>
<p>in our government.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really scary</p>
<p>to put the ministry of truth</p>
<p>under the department</p>
<p>that has all the soldiers</p>
<p>and all the weapons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the name of it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s close.</p>
<p>Pretty darn close.</p>
<p>Now, why is it there?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you why.</p>
<p>Because this was built up to,</p>
<p>there was a-</p>
<p>The ministry of truth.</p>
<p>Shout out George Orwell.</p>
<p>A couple of months ago,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a news story</p>
<p>that we might&rsquo;ve covered on this pod</p>
<p>where the Homeland Security Department</p>
<p>redefined disinformation to comprise,</p>
<p>they said it represented</p>
<p>an escalation of the terror threat level.</p>
<p>So in other words,</p>
<p>they basically said that disinformation</p>
<p>was tantamount to terrorism.</p>
<p>Remember that?</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t we talk about that?</p>
<p>This is the payoff to that.</p>
<p>First, they define,</p>
<p>they basically define the other side</p>
<p>as being disinformation,</p>
<p>of the debate,</p>
<p>as being disinformation.</p>
<p>Then they define disinformation</p>
<p>as basically terrorism.</p>
<p>Then they have the Homeland</p>
<p>Security Department,</p>
<p>which is supposed to be</p>
<p>responsible for terrorism,</p>
<p>create this ministry of truth.</p>
<p>This is what&rsquo;s going on here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really weird.</p>
<p>Just to remind everyone,</p>
<p>there was concern in the last election.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to play devil&rsquo;s advocate</p>
<p>as I often find myself doing here.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Just to try and explain the world,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the reason</p>
<p>I often play this role,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m trying to understand the world.</p>
<p>But, you know,</p>
<p>there was a real concern</p>
<p>that, you know,</p>
<p>the Russian government was using,</p>
<p>you know, information warfare</p>
<p>and propaganda through social media</p>
<p>to influence voting.</p>
<p>And that that is considered</p>
<p>a security threat</p>
<p>to the integrity of our elections.</p>
<p>Therefore, this is a homeland security issue.</p>
<p>And there is a question mark,</p>
<p>of course, that everyone has</p>
<p>on how far are they going to go</p>
<p>once you set this precedent?</p>
<p>When would they ever stop</p>
<p>in terms of quote, unquote,</p>
<p>policing information</p>
<p>and policing what&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>and managing internal propaganda</p>
<p>and internal media</p>
<p>delivered to us by the government?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the other side of the coin.</p>
<p>But the primary side of the coin,</p>
<p>the initial side,</p>
<p>the initial representation</p>
<p>that I think folks do have concerns around</p>
<p>is how do we keep foreign actors</p>
<p>from creating misinformation campaigns</p>
<p>that go viral and influence elections?</p>
<p>And Saks, I don&rsquo;t know if you think</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s a concern</p>
<p>we should or shouldn&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>but how would you address it</p>
<p>if you were the president?</p>
<p>And that was the challenge,</p>
<p>you know, to like,</p>
<p>how do we stop that from happening?</p>
<p>The foreign actors</p>
<p>interfering in our elections</p>
<p>is certainly a concern</p>
<p>we should have</p>
<p>if it was actually happening</p>
<p>on a big scale</p>
<p>or in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>I mean, this is basically,</p>
<p>look, this is basically a hoax, okay?</p>
<p>John Durham is basically out there</p>
<p>making indictments right now,</p>
<p>proving the extent of this hoax.</p>
<p>It started with the whole steel dossier,</p>
<p>which was a piece of campaign</p>
<p>opposition research</p>
<p>that was manufactured</p>
<p>by Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s campaign.</p>
<p>The lawyers who basically produced it</p>
<p>are under indictment,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where this whole thing</p>
<p>of Russian disinformation came from.</p>
<p>And the only proof for that thesis</p>
<p>is that supposedly the Russians</p>
<p>bought $100,000 of Facebook ads</p>
<p>on Facebook.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not denying that that occurred,</p>
<p>but it was relatively minor.</p>
<p>It was a drop in the bucket</p>
<p>of all the activity going on</p>
<p>around the last election.</p>
<p>Wait, to be clear, to be clear,</p>
<p>that was just the ads</p>
<p>that were bought with,</p>
<p>with like credit cards</p>
<p>that said like FSB on it.</p>
<p>Way to go, Facebook security team.</p>
<p>You probably, you know,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t count all the number of credit cards</p>
<p>that were stolen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure the Russians</p>
<p>are capable of stealing</p>
<p>John Smith&rsquo;s credit card</p>
<p>and using that to buy ads as well.</p>
<p>Well, I saw, I looked at those ads.</p>
<p>Are you seeing those ads?</p>
<p>They were ludicrous.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t going to convince</p>
<p>anybody of anything.</p>
<p>I mean, they had like Jesus</p>
<p>and the devil arm wrestling each other,</p>
<p>and the Jesus figure was basically saying,</p>
<p>and you know, it was just absurd.</p>
<p>I mean, the Jesus figure was saying that-</p>
<p>Okay, wait, to be clear, it happened,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve now stepped back</p>
<p>your position on like,</p>
<p>it just wasn&rsquo;t at scale to your opinion.</p>
<p>I think, I think, look,</p>
<p>the scale interference in the election</p>
<p>was committed by big tech.</p>
<p>I mean, they censored</p>
<p>the Hunter Biden story</p>
<p>two weeks before the election.</p>
<p>It turns out that&rsquo;s a completely true story</p>
<p>that Hunter Biden has extensive</p>
<p>business dealings in Ukraine,</p>
<p>the country we are now-</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But we are now deeply involved</p>
<p>in a war there.</p>
<p>And that story,</p>
<p>the electorate had the right</p>
<p>to take that into account.</p>
<p>Big tech censored that story.</p>
<p>So look-</p>
<p>There was a reason for that.</p>
<p>May I respond to that?</p>
<p>Just to give people like</p>
<p>making a very difficult decision,</p>
<p>you have to remember,</p>
<p>Trump asked Putin on stage</p>
<p>to hack Hillary&rsquo;s emails, and they did.</p>
<p>Then he asked the Ukraine</p>
<p>to take action against the Bidens,</p>
<p>or he wouldn&rsquo;t give them support.</p>
<p>He was impeached for that.</p>
<p>So if you put yourself in the,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not saying Twitter</p>
<p>made the right decision here,</p>
<p>but there was,</p>
<p>and there was also sexual material,</p>
<p>you know, people&rsquo;s nudes,</p>
<p>and hacked material,</p>
<p>and nudes are against</p>
<p>the terms of service.</p>
<p>So I think two things</p>
<p>happened concurrently.</p>
<p>One, listen,</p>
<p>the people working at Twitter</p>
<p>are 98% liberal.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want Trump.</p>
<p>They saw it as an existential threat.</p>
<p>And then two,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want to link</p>
<p>to hacked material.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>Well, hold on a second.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>During the whole Canadian-</p>
<p>Hold on, let me finish, let me finish.</p>
<p>Let me finish this point.</p>
<p>No, I have to finish my point.</p>
<p>The third point,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll let you go,</p>
<p>is that in addition to all that,</p>
<p>Hunter Biden is completely a grifter.</p>
<p>Go.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I agree with you on that one.</p>
<p>So look,</p>
<p>during the whole Canadian trucker thing,</p>
<p>remember when all the people</p>
<p>who contributed to those Canadian truckers,</p>
<p>they got doxed.</p>
<p>I mean, basically there was a hacker</p>
<p>who leaked all the people</p>
<p>who had donated,</p>
<p>and social networks were happy</p>
<p>to print all that information.</p>
<p>So this idea that they censor</p>
<p>hacked information is nonsense.</p>
<p>The Libs of TikTok account</p>
<p>just got doxed by Taylor Lorenz.</p>
<p>Look, whether you think</p>
<p>that was a good idea or not,</p>
<p>the point is these principles</p>
<p>are invoked very selectively</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a story</p>
<p>they want to suppress.</p>
<p>And the New York Times</p>
<p>and the Washington Post</p>
<p>have both not come out</p>
<p>and said that the laptop was real,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been authenticated,</p>
<p>the story was real,</p>
<p>and this whole idea</p>
<p>that it was disinformation,</p>
<p>that was just invented.</p>
<p>I mean, it was just invented.</p>
<p>Well, no, hacked.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t that it was disinformation,</p>
<p>it was that it was potentially hacked.</p>
<p>And you and Trump,</p>
<p>Nothing was hacked.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing,</p>
<p>Trump set the stage for that.</p>
<p>And the people at Twitter and Facebook</p>
<p>who also made these decisions,</p>
<p>they were informed</p>
<p>by three later agencies,</p>
<p>Department of Justice</p>
<p>and FBI, etc.</p>
<p>Hey, this is potentially</p>
<p>hacked material</p>
<p>designed to interfere</p>
<p>with the election.</p>
<p>Listen, Nina Jankovic</p>
<p>and other Democratic</p>
<p>Party operatives</p>
<p>just made up out of whole cloth</p>
<p>that the Hunter Biden story</p>
<p>was disinformation.</p>
<p>It was true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been acknowledged as true.</p>
<p>The Washington Post is true.</p>
<p>I mean, I think this is true.</p>
<p>So hold on.</p>
<p>So it goes to my point.</p>
<p>Social media can improve.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not about improving it.</p>
<p>Look.</p>
<p>Well, no, no,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t fear my sentence.</p>
<p>I think this is where</p>
<p>social media can improve,</p>
<p>which is if they had to explain</p>
<p>every one of these decisions</p>
<p>they make in full</p>
<p>in transparency,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>Elon could bring to this party,</p>
<p>which is if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to block something,</p>
<p>we need to know why.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;d never explain why</p>
<p>and who made the decision.</p>
<p>And I think that that transparency</p>
<p>would benefit situations like this.</p>
<p>If the DOJ or FBI told them,</p>
<p>this is hacked material,</p>
<p>then they got to go to the DOJ</p>
<p>and FBI and say,</p>
<p>you got to give us cover here.</p>
<p>If this is, in fact,</p>
<p>hacked material,</p>
<p>you told us not to print it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to print it.</p>
<p>But it was just bizarre</p>
<p>that one publication got dinged,</p>
<p>like the New York Post.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The oldest, the oldest</p>
<p>newspaper in America,</p>
<p>the oldest newspaper in America.</p>
<p>Also not the bastion of like.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not for you to decide.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not for Twitter to decide.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a legitimate publication</p>
<p>that had a true story.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t disagree.</p>
<p>And it was relevant to the election</p>
<p>and the American people</p>
<p>should have been able</p>
<p>to take that into account.</p>
<p>And people like Nina Jankovic,</p>
<p>whatever, our new czar</p>
<p>of the Ministry of Truth,</p>
<p>she was out in the forefront,</p>
<p>basically calling</p>
<p>that story disinformation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, she&rsquo;s pushing</p>
<p>the Steele dossier,</p>
<p>which really was.</p>
<p>If that story was confirmed,</p>
<p>would Biden have won?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the answer to that.</p>
<p>But the point is that</p>
<p>this shouldn&rsquo;t have been suppressed.</p>
<p>That was that was</p>
<p>election interference.</p>
<p>Now, Elon came out this week</p>
<p>and specifically tweeted that,</p>
<p>that that was basically a mistake.</p>
<p>Jack also said it was a bad.</p>
<p>Jackman said it was a mistake, too.</p>
<p>And Elon repeated the same thing</p>
<p>that they shouldn&rsquo;t have done that.</p>
<p>I think everybody can agree</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a bad call in hindsight.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>But in hindsight, right.</p>
<p>But what was the reaction</p>
<p>to what Elon said?</p>
<p>He was accused by virtue of criticizing</p>
<p>the policy decision that Twitter made,</p>
<p>that that was supposedly</p>
<p>targeted harassment</p>
<p>of the legal counsel at Twitter</p>
<p>who made the decision</p>
<p>who gets paid $17 million a year</p>
<p>to make those decisions.</p>
<p>Do you guys see this debate?</p>
<p>This happened last year,</p>
<p>this last week.</p>
<p>So the point is that</p>
<p>if you criticize somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s on a certain side of the debate,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s harassment.</p>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t even mention her by name.</p>
<p>This is how absurd</p>
<p>this discourse has gotten.</p>
<p>Can I make a prediction?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Prediction&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I think people misunderstand</p>
<p>Elon&rsquo;s incentives for buying Twitter.</p>
<p>So, and I haven&rsquo;t talked to him about this.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just making a complete</p>
<p>subjective prediction.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s going to buy Twitter.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s going to clean it up.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s probably going to generate</p>
<p>something like a two X on this.</p>
<p>We talked about how</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like a good terminal valuation</p>
<p>in six or seven years.</p>
<p>That basically puts that asset worth</p>
<p>at around $100 billion.</p>
<p>In the meantime,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s going to open source</p>
<p>as much as possible.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s going to make it very difficult</p>
<p>for misinformation and disinformation</p>
<p>to get very far.</p>
<p>He said he&rsquo;s going to authenticate</p>
<p>every human being that uses the platform.</p>
<p>He said all of these things publicly already.</p>
<p>And then here&rsquo;s the master stroke.</p>
<p>And again, this is just me speculating.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s going to donate it</p>
<p>into a foundation and a trust.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>an incredibly powerful competitive</p>
<p>alternative to all these</p>
<p>other for profit businesses,</p>
<p>because everything you guys</p>
<p>are talking about</p>
<p>is the incentives that get perverted</p>
<p>when you have to layer economics</p>
<p>inside the New York Post,</p>
<p>inside the Washington Post,</p>
<p>inside the New York Times,</p>
<p>the Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>Everything eventually devolves</p>
<p>to clickbait, to hearsay,</p>
<p>to doxing, to whatever</p>
<p>can get you more revenue.</p>
<p>But if you can take it</p>
<p>off the table and run these things</p>
<p>as a public trust,</p>
<p>you can actually win back</p>
<p>a bunch of confidence.</p>
<p>And a lot of these edge cases go away.</p>
<p>Now you would say,</p>
<p>why would anybody do that?</p>
<p>Well, I think the real answer</p>
<p>is because then if he were</p>
<p>to donate it into a foundation,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d get $100 billion credit</p>
<p>that he could use,</p>
<p>you know, to offset the gains</p>
<p>when SpaceX or Starlink go public.</p>
<p>Interesting theory.</p>
<p>Interesting theory.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Well, I agree with everything</p>
<p>except for the donation part,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s raising</p>
<p>20-something billion from</p>
<p>private equity partners and lenders.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll pay the debt off.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll own it 100%.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;ll pay people</p>
<p>a very fair living wage.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll attract people</p>
<p>that want to seek out the truth,</p>
<p>that want to work in</p>
<p>an apolitical environment.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s already said</p>
<p>that 10% of the extremes,</p>
<p>you know, are both equally crazy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to force this thing</p>
<p>to be rational and predictable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting prediction.</p>
<p>I think it goes public again,</p>
<p>and it goes to five times evaluation.</p>
<p>Are we going to be able to ask him</p>
<p>these questions in Miami?</p>
<p>Sure. Why not?</p>
<p>So let me ask you guys a question.</p>
<p>What would you do?</p>
<p>Because a lot of people have pointed out</p>
<p>in response to</p>
<p>what has obviously become</p>
<p>a very polarizing set of discussions</p>
<p>this week around</p>
<p>what should be censored,</p>
<p>what should be banned,</p>
<p>what shouldn&rsquo;t, etc.</p>
<p>Elon&rsquo;s going to let bullying</p>
<p>and hate speech kind of proliferate.</p>
<p>Other people have said</p>
<p>we need to release,</p>
<p>you know, the restrictions</p>
<p>and let people say what they want to say.</p>
<p>Freedom of speech has no bounds, etc.</p>
<p>What do you guys think about the argument</p>
<p>that there does need to be</p>
<p>constraints and boundaries set</p>
<p>around things related to health</p>
<p>and safety?</p>
<p>Meaning if someone is making</p>
<p>calls to violent action,</p>
<p>should that be censored, Saks?</p>
<p>And how do you make that interpretation</p>
<p>because it becomes</p>
<p>a fuzzy gray interpretation?</p>
<p>And then separately, like</p>
<p>when there are scientific papers</p>
<p>that say one thing</p>
<p>and someone says that&rsquo;s not true</p>
<p>and says something else,</p>
<p>how do you kind of decide</p>
<p>whether or not that should be</p>
<p>allowed or censored on the platform?</p>
<p>Because I think those are two</p>
<p>very key issues that</p>
<p>we got to take them separately.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do violence first.</p>
<p>Saks, there&rsquo;s plenty of precedent</p>
<p>in law.</p>
<p>Just explain the violence.</p>
<p>Look, the biggest straw man around</p>
<p>this was the whole Trump argument, right?</p>
<p>It was like he was inciting violence</p>
<p>was the argument that was being made.</p>
<p>But like, generally speaking,</p>
<p>is that an appropriate form of censorship</p>
<p>on this private platform?</p>
<p>And if so, how do you set that standard?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start here with</p>
<p>you hear this argument a lot,</p>
<p>which is that if Elon brings</p>
<p>free speech back to Twitter,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>all this horrible content on there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have violence,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have racism,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have harassment,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have all, you know,</p>
<p>all these bad things on fraud.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really a straw man argument</p>
<p>because what it&rsquo;s basically arguing</p>
<p>is that free speech means anything goes,</p>
<p>but free speech does not mean anything goes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s we have 230 years</p>
<p>of Supreme Court case law,</p>
<p>basically discussing this question</p>
<p>of what speech is protected</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>And the Supreme Court</p>
<p>has ruled that there&rsquo;s nine</p>
<p>major categories of speech</p>
<p>that are not protected</p>
<p>by the First Amendment.</p>
<p>Why? Because that speech</p>
<p>is considered to be dangerous</p>
<p>in one degree or another.</p>
<p>So, for example,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t commit fraud</p>
<p>like, you know,</p>
<p>the Archegos guy or whatever</p>
<p>and then say, well,</p>
<p>that speech was protected</p>
<p>by the First Amendment.</p>
<p>First Amendment doesn&rsquo;t protect fraud.</p>
<p>First Amendment doesn&rsquo;t protect</p>
<p>incitement to commit violence</p>
<p>or a crime.</p>
<p>You know, it doesn&rsquo;t protect</p>
<p>fighting words.</p>
<p>So you could ban, you know,</p>
<p>all ethnic or racial slurs</p>
<p>on these social networks</p>
<p>under the concept of fighting words.</p>
<p>So I think if you actually look</p>
<p>at Supreme Court case law,</p>
<p>well, what I would do is I,</p>
<p>instead of just making up</p>
<p>the content moderation policies</p>
<p>as I went along,</p>
<p>I would look at the cases</p>
<p>where people have been wrestling</p>
<p>with these decisions for decades.</p>
<p>And I would create a content</p>
<p>moderation policy</p>
<p>inspired by First Amendment case law,</p>
<p>where I would take</p>
<p>these nine categories</p>
<p>of sort of dangerous speech</p>
<p>or harmful speech,</p>
<p>and I would operationalize those.</p>
<p>So, for example,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t defame people</p>
<p>you know, the First Amendment</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t protect you</p>
<p>against claims of defamation.</p>
<p>Would you make people go to court,</p>
<p>though, in order to take it down?</p>
<p>Right. So this is where the word</p>
<p>operationalize really comes in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not practical</p>
<p>for a social network</p>
<p>to require a court level</p>
<p>burden of proof</p>
<p>to prove defamation, right?</p>
<p>So what I would do is I would say</p>
<p>that if you are a person</p>
<p>who claims to be defamed,</p>
<p>you could file a report on Twitter</p>
<p>and provide the tweet</p>
<p>and provide, you know,</p>
<p>some explanation.</p>
<p>And as long as it looks</p>
<p>like a culpable claim of defamation,</p>
<p>meaning the person is attacking you</p>
<p>in a way that seems out of bounds,</p>
<p>then potentially</p>
<p>that can be taken down.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to subject it</p>
<p>to a jury trial</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>So what I would do is I wouldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t literally</p>
<p>impose First Amendment case law,</p>
<p>but I would use it</p>
<p>as the basis for defining</p>
<p>a content moderation policy.</p>
<p>Can I just say something?</p>
<p>I think one of the best things</p>
<p>about being your friend</p>
<p>is sometimes you say stuff</p>
<p>that is so powerfully</p>
<p>smart and elegant</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so simple.</p>
<p>Basically what Saks said</p>
<p>for everybody else,</p>
<p>because this is how I,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>the PRD for content moderation</p>
<p>has existed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the Constitution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that nobody</p>
<p>in any of these companies</p>
<p>has taken an effort</p>
<p>to actually try to write code</p>
<p>that maps to this PRD,</p>
<p>where the PRD is the Constitution</p>
<p>whose rights have been established</p>
<p>for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>By PRD, you mean</p>
<p>product requirements document.</p>
<p>Yeah, sorry, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s what a product manager</p>
<p>would use.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Instead of them making this up</p>
<p>as they go along,</p>
<p>I would look to the categories of speech</p>
<p>the Supreme Court has already</p>
<p>ruled out as being dangerous.</p>
<p>Write a PRD, write a PRD.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just do the health one, Saks.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a scientific paper</p>
<p>that says this drug</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t cure COVID.</p>
<p>And then someone goes on Twitter</p>
<p>and says, take this drug,</p>
<p>it cures COVID.</p>
<p>And I know you&rsquo;re not obviously</p>
<p>a constitutional lawyer</p>
<p>at this point in your career,</p>
<p>but how would you kind of think</p>
<p>about that?</p>
<p>And how do you think that</p>
<p>that would ultimately resolve</p>
<p>in this regulatory framework?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a debate that should exist.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know why</p>
<p>we need to suppress that debate.</p>
<p>So if someone says declaratively</p>
<p>on Twitter,</p>
<p>this drug will cure COVID,</p>
<p>which by the way,</p>
<p>And it trends.</p>
<p>And just to be clear, by the way,</p>
<p>you know, the FDA actually regulates</p>
<p>claims like that on boxes</p>
<p>and material and in a commercial setting.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re making money off Twitter</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re getting a lot of followers</p>
<p>and then you make more money</p>
<p>by putting out a tweet that says,</p>
<p>Yeah, but you&rsquo;re not making money</p>
<p>off the drug.</p>
<p>Yeah, right, exactly.</p>
<p>If the person is selling the drug,</p>
<p>Roche should never say that.</p>
<p>Right. So if someone went on Twitter</p>
<p>and they said, take this drug,</p>
<p>it cures COVID,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a site.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re confusing facts and authority.</p>
<p>Twitter is riddled with people</p>
<p>that have zero authority</p>
<p>that spit out what they think are facts.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So I think what you&rsquo;re speaking to</p>
<p>is something very different,</p>
<p>which is if you&rsquo;re going to design</p>
<p>a social network,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been part of helping to design one.</p>
<p>So let me just give you</p>
<p>my two cents on this topic.</p>
<p>There are layers of decision making</p>
<p>that need to go into an algorithm</p>
<p>to get to a sense of rank.</p>
<p>Rank means,</p>
<p>do we believe with some</p>
<p>reasonable probability distribution</p>
<p>in some probability distribution</p>
<p>that this thing</p>
<p>is worth showing to somebody else?</p>
<p>And the way that you get there</p>
<p>is through multiple layers.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s obviously a layer</p>
<p>where you can get signal</p>
<p>relative to the authenticity</p>
<p>of the person and individual</p>
<p>making the claim.</p>
<p>Is it a bot?</p>
<p>Is it a real person?</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s a separate layer,</p>
<p>which is how roughly accurate</p>
<p>do we think this is?</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s another layer,</p>
<p>which is, is this person believable</p>
<p>in making all of those statements?</p>
<p>And my point is,</p>
<p>there are different subsystems</p>
<p>you build for those things.</p>
<p>He has already said</p>
<p>all these algorithms</p>
<p>are going to be open sourced.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>is authority.</p>
<p>You should allow people</p>
<p>to say stupid things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not illegal.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yes. A person can be</p>
<p>on a street corner saying,</p>
<p>Jesus is the son of God</p>
<p>and he will save your soul.</p>
<p>Saks doesn&rsquo;t have to believe him.</p>
<p>And somebody can say that on Twitter.</p>
<p>The issue here is,</p>
<p>does it trend?</p>
<p>And do you show it to people,</p>
<p>the algorithm?</p>
<p>And if you fix those problems,</p>
<p>then who cares if a person says,</p>
<p>hey, listen.</p>
<p>Twitter has an authority problem</p>
<p>and a ranking problem.</p>
<p>And the authority problem</p>
<p>comes from the fact</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s all kinds of long tail,</p>
<p>non-human individuals in the system.</p>
<p>So solve for identity.</p>
<p>And this problem can get easier solved</p>
<p>and solve for trending.</p>
<p>And if you guys were running Twitter,</p>
<p>you would not put on</p>
<p>these COVID-19 warnings.</p>
<p>This is misinformation.</p>
<p>I like labels.</p>
<p>And rely solely on CDC guidance</p>
<p>and recommendations</p>
<p>and FDA approvals</p>
<p>when it comes to treatments</p>
<p>and vaccines and risks and so on.</p>
<p>What I would do is let anyone</p>
<p>say whatever they wanted.</p>
<p>You can say what you want,</p>
<p>but you can put a label.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not arguing for the kids.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to get clarity here.</p>
<p>Yeah. He&rsquo;s just asking the question.</p>
<p>I would, what I would do is</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to use taxes.</p>
<p>I would label it.</p>
<p>And I would, I wouldn&rsquo;t label it</p>
<p>right or wrong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say ivermectin is a drug.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the Wikipedia page.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the Wikipedia page on ivermectin.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s a lot of confusion</p>
<p>about ivermectin, which there was.</p>
<p>You could just put anytime</p>
<p>anybody says the word ivermectin.</p>
<p>I here&rsquo;s a sentence</p>
<p>of what ivermectin is.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the Wikipedia page,</p>
<p>the CDC page,</p>
<p>the UK government&rsquo;s page, DHS,</p>
<p>whatever for more information</p>
<p>about this topic.</p>
<p>So I just want to, not a warning.</p>
<p>Yeah. I just wanted to learn more.</p>
<p>J Cal, I want to disagree</p>
<p>with what you&rsquo;re proposing.</p>
<p>Okay. Cause it is the topic.</p>
<p>The juror, it was the one-off</p>
<p>that then triggered the ability</p>
<p>for everyone to bifurcate</p>
<p>on their point of view</p>
<p>on what should or shouldn&rsquo;t be done.</p>
<p>As opposed to having a universal standard</p>
<p>that is universally applied.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t speak specifically</p>
<p>to just the COVID-19 pandemic</p>
<p>or just ivermectin,</p>
<p>or just what Trump said or didn&rsquo;t say.</p>
<p>But each one of these things can</p>
<p>and should be universally standardized</p>
<p>and then universally communicated</p>
<p>and then treated with universal standards</p>
<p>across everyone and every topic,</p>
<p>rather than have each of these breakouts</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve got someone at Twitter</p>
<p>scratching their head saying,</p>
<p>this seems to be an important topic.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s come in and annotate it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s create a classification for this.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where everyone gets riled up.</p>
<p>In my opinion.</p>
<p>I think if there was a universal standard</p>
<p>that was universally applied</p>
<p>without judgment to the topic.</p>
<p>Give an example.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>Can I address this?</p>
<p>Well, vaccines is another good example,</p>
<p>but yeah.</p>
<p>First of all, nobody contradicted the CDC</p>
<p>more than the CDC itself.</p>
<p>It constantly put out revisions</p>
<p>of its old opinions.</p>
<p>First, it said that COVID</p>
<p>was not spread human to human.</p>
<p>Then it obviously said that it was.</p>
<p>It basically was against masks</p>
<p>and it was for them.</p>
<p>And on and on and on it went, okay.</p>
<p>The idea that you cannot criticize</p>
<p>your government or an agency</p>
<p>of the government is absurd.</p>
<p>But that is the type of censorship</p>
<p>that was being leveled</p>
<p>in these social networks</p>
<p>is that basically they are preventing</p>
<p>us from criticizing the so-called experts.</p>
<p>That is precisely the kind of censorship</p>
<p>that should not exist on these networks.</p>
<p>That is precisely the kind of debate.</p>
<p>What about labeling?</p>
<p>In the way I talked about it,</p>
<p>like the problem with more information,</p>
<p>the problem with labeling is,</p>
<p>once again, it&rsquo;s done selectively.</p>
<p>And the people at Twitter</p>
<p>basically decide who they think</p>
<p>is right in a debate.</p>
<p>And they basically want to act</p>
<p>as a referee to raise the hand</p>
<p>of one of the participants of the debate,</p>
<p>raise their hand over their head,</p>
<p>and declare them the victor.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s a lot better to label</p>
<p>than to just censor</p>
<p>the other side&rsquo;s point of view.</p>
<p>But still, it is a form of soft censorship.</p>
<p>The labeling I described where,</p>
<p>and which happens on our podcast</p>
<p>on Spotify, where it says,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the COVID Information Center,</p>
<p>you know, for more information.</p>
<p>And they give a range of,</p>
<p>so if it&rsquo;s executed in that way,</p>
<p>do you oppose it?</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s like a very confusing</p>
<p>public interest going on?</p>
<p>If you were to algorithmically post</p>
<p>related stories or something like that,</p>
<p>and it was done in a completely fair</p>
<p>and speech neutral way,</p>
<p>and it was just as a feature of Twitter,</p>
<p>fine.</p>
<p>But if you have employees at Twitter</p>
<p>sitting around discussing issues</p>
<p>and deciding who the winner is</p>
<p>in various debates,</p>
<p>and then putting their thumb</p>
<p>on the scale to tilt the debate</p>
<p>towards those people,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not what they should be doing.</p>
<p>Now, you know, and that is basically</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re doing with censorship.</p>
<p>If you look again,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go back to this topic</p>
<p>of misinformation,</p>
<p>because this is really</p>
<p>the crux of the debate, okay?</p>
<p>Once again, on the basis</p>
<p>of First Amendment case law,</p>
<p>you could remove offensive material</p>
<p>on Twitter on the basis</p>
<p>that it is, you know, fighting words,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a slur, it&rsquo;s harassment,</p>
<p>incitement to violence.</p>
<p>You could, it&rsquo;s fraud, okay?</p>
<p>Inauthentic that the account</p>
<p>is not who they purport to be.</p>
<p>You remove all the bots.</p>
<p>So all that content can get removed.</p>
<p>So what is really left then?</p>
<p>It is basically this idea</p>
<p>of misinformation, this idea</p>
<p>that we are going to declare</p>
<p>one party the victor in this debate.</p>
<p>And I think that is what is so offensive</p>
<p>about this mystery of truth,</p>
<p>that Homeland Security is setting up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so offensive</p>
<p>about the censorship that Twitter</p>
<p>has been practicing,</p>
<p>which is they are trying</p>
<p>to end the debate.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to say, look,</p>
<p>this is the person</p>
<p>with the, on the side of truth.</p>
<p>And that is not what</p>
<p>they should be doing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s up to the marketplace</p>
<p>to decide what the truth is.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>There you have it, folks.</p>
<p>Do you disagree with that?</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>To your point, David,</p>
<p>I do think in a situation</p>
<p>where the public good,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s confusion in a situation,</p>
<p>sending people to more information</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t a bad idea.</p>
<p>I do think a lot of this,</p>
<p>there were thumbs on the scales</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t transparent</p>
<p>what was happening.</p>
<p>I think if you add transparency,</p>
<p>so I think every time</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an action that&rsquo;s taken,</p>
<p>it should say agent number</p>
<p>and what their agent number is,</p>
<p>took this action on this tweet</p>
<p>for this reason.</p>
<p>And then data scientists can look</p>
<p>at all the actions that occur</p>
<p>and then say, look,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re looking at this agent number</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s their manager&rsquo;s agent number.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s why they took down this post.</p>
<p>You know, then at least</p>
<p>you could have a starting point</p>
<p>to figure out what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even have enough information</p>
<p>to know what thumbs are on what scales,</p>
<p>if at all, or to what extent.</p>
<p>And I would like to see transparency first</p>
<p>so we could have a more informed decision.</p>
<p>And then sending people</p>
<p>to trusted information sources,</p>
<p>a group of them isn&rsquo;t a bad idea.</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s trusted.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, and so to your point,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to look to a podcaster,</p>
<p>a social network or the government</p>
<p>to find truth in the world.</p>
<p>You have to have a process yourself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of what this podcast is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for people to develop</p>
<p>part of being an adult.</p>
<p>Yes. You have to come up</p>
<p>with your own process</p>
<p>of coming to the truth.</p>
<p>You could trust,</p>
<p>some people trust the government agencies.</p>
<p>Some people trust Joe Rogan</p>
<p>or a podcast or this podcast.</p>
<p>Some people trust a folk singer.</p>
<p>Trust yourself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the number one thing</p>
<p>you have to learn how to do</p>
<p>as an adult in life,</p>
<p>taking all this information</p>
<p>and make a reasonable decision</p>
<p>to take ivermectin</p>
<p>or to not take ivermectin</p>
<p>is a perfect example.</p>
<p>People said there&rsquo;s no downside to it.</p>
<p>People have been taking this drug forever</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s cheap.</p>
<p>And then another group of people said,</p>
<p>well, you&rsquo;re taking horse medicine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something completely different.</p>
<p>And the whole conversation became,</p>
<p>I felt very easy to parse.</p>
<p>When you think about</p>
<p>doing your own research,</p>
<p>do your own research, right?</p>
<p>And talk to your doctor,</p>
<p>do your own research,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t do your own research</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not permitted</p>
<p>to see everything.</p>
<p>And, and you think about</p>
<p>like with drugs,</p>
<p>think about how many drugs</p>
<p>over the last 30,</p>
<p>40 years have become the basis</p>
<p>for product liability lawsuits</p>
<p>because they had unintended side effects</p>
<p>or consequences.</p>
<p>And they revised the use of those drugs</p>
<p>or drugs were taken off the market.</p>
<p>If people weren&rsquo;t allowed</p>
<p>to question those things,</p>
<p>because supposedly the experts</p>
<p>had ruled on the issue</p>
<p>and ended the debate,</p>
<p>how would we have gotten</p>
<p>a correction on that?</p>
<p>How would we have gotten to the truth?</p>
<p>So just because the experts say something</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that is true.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s pros and cons to this.</p>
<p>We have kids getting, tons of kids</p>
<p>taking all kinds of SRIs</p>
<p>and antidepressants</p>
<p>and all kinds of drugs.</p>
<p>Parents have to make difficult decisions.</p>
<p>Adult need to make difficult decisions.</p>
<p>Do they do this?</p>
<p>Do they not?</p>
<p>And by the way, there&rsquo;s no,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing large scale</p>
<p>experimentations on the population</p>
<p>in real time with drugs.</p>
<p>It is a decision you have to do</p>
<p>the pros and cons for.</p>
<p>The medical establishment,</p>
<p>the medical establishment</p>
<p>at one point in time</p>
<p>thought it was a good idea</p>
<p>to lobotomize people.</p>
<p>Like they were doing that</p>
<p>as like a medical procedure.</p>
<p>So these people can be wrong, you know,</p>
<p>this idea that we&rsquo;ve arrived</p>
<p>at the end of history</p>
<p>and we know the truth.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s all truth.</p>
<p>No new facts are being,</p>
<p>or no new knowledge is being created.</p>
<p>For fuck&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>I mean, is red wine good for you</p>
<p>or bad for you?</p>
<p>Because every three</p>
<p>or four fucking years,</p>
<p>coffee and red wine are good for you</p>
<p>or bad for you,</p>
<p>depending on the year.</p>
<p>Well, I saw,</p>
<p>I saw a longitudinal study</p>
<p>that just came out that said</p>
<p>there are no caloric benefits</p>
<p>of intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>that would be up in arms with that.</p>
<p>What are you supposed to do if,</p>
<p>if, you know,</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s some value</p>
<p>to organ health.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s some value</p>
<p>to managing your glycemic index.</p>
<p>But again, the point is</p>
<p>there are study upon study.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s work going on all the time.</p>
<p>All these things</p>
<p>are in an area of gray.</p>
<p>And so if all of a sudden</p>
<p>you jump down one person&rsquo;s throat</p>
<p>and basically become very judgy</p>
<p>because you think that</p>
<p>the total bounded body of knowledge</p>
<p>has already been created,</p>
<p>you are making an enormous mistake.</p>
<p>I mean, Steve Jobs thought</p>
<p>he could cure his own cancer.</p>
<p>I mean, intelligent people</p>
<p>are free to make bad decisions.</p>
<p>He was one of the most intelligent,</p>
<p>talented people in the world</p>
<p>who by all accounts</p>
<p>might have survived longer</p>
<p>if he had trusted.</p>
<p>He went to this very specific method</p>
<p>of juicing.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a certain sliver of folks.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a really incredible documentary</p>
<p>actually on Netflix</p>
<p>if you want to understand it</p>
<p>of people that went down this path</p>
<p>of juicing,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to eliminate their cancer.</p>
<p>Micronutrients.</p>
<p>The irony is that the people</p>
<p>who are, I think,</p>
<p>some of the stupidest people,</p>
<p>like that woman singing show tunes,</p>
<p>like these are the people</p>
<p>who are making these determinations</p>
<p>over what is true and what is false</p>
<p>and what is labeled as information</p>
<p>and what we get to discuss.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s riddled with bias.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s riddled with bias.</p>
<p>You have to make your own decisions</p>
<p>in these cases.</p>
<p>And, you know, like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s great to have smart friends</p>
<p>to have a dialogue with.</p>
<p>No, but it&rsquo;s a beautiful dialogue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the beautiful thing</p>
<p>about being an American</p>
<p>and working so hard</p>
<p>to get to this country</p>
<p>is the independence</p>
<p>and the freedom to be your own self.</p>
<p>I mean, why is that such a bad thing?</p>
<p>And why would anybody</p>
<p>want to give that up</p>
<p>to a nameless, faceless blob</p>
<p>in an organization?</p>
<p>Well, and the response</p>
<p>you get back from people is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not abdicating my ability</p>
<p>to think for myself</p>
<p>to this rando woman</p>
<p>singing show tunes.</p>
<p>And then people say like,</p>
<p>oh, well, the response I got</p>
<p>when I said just entrust yourself</p>
<p>is like, well,</p>
<p>what about all these bros</p>
<p>who are listening to Joe Rogan</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re making decisions</p>
<p>on their health,</p>
<p>according to Joe Rogan?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m like, yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called personal responsibility.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not responsible</p>
<p>for Joe Rogan&rsquo;s listeners.</p>
<p>The same person that told you</p>
<p>that is probably microdosing</p>
<p>and thinking ayahuasca</p>
<p>is the solution to every problem</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
<p>Intermittent fasting and microjuicing.</p>
<p>And from the childhood trauma</p>
<p>they had when they didn&rsquo;t win</p>
<p>their, you know, soccer medal</p>
<p>and nobody knows</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t get into Harvard.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re on ayahuasca every day.</p>
<p>I mean, give me a break.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Nobody knows.</p>
<p>No, we all know so little.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what we know.</p>
<p>You live, you die.</p>
<p>The end.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re all just trying</p>
<p>to do our best.</p>
<p>And so why don&rsquo;t we all</p>
<p>just try to have</p>
<p>a reasonably decent time</p>
<p>and be nice to each other?</p>
<p>All right, everybody.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been an amazing episode.</p>
<p>We will see you in Miami,</p>
<p>which will be absolutely fun</p>
<p>and thrilling.</p>
<p>Sold out.</p>
<p>Our first all-in assignment.</p>
<p>And last,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>who the fuck&rsquo;s going to do</p>
<p>this work next time.</p>
<p>You will.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing an amazing job.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll continue it.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>I love you, boys.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room</p>
<p>and just have one big huge orgy</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension</p>
<p>that they just need to release somehow.</p>
