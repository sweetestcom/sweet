    <p>We are becoming cyborgs.</p>
<p>Our brains are fundamentally changed.</p>
<p>Everyone who grew up with electronics,</p>
<p>we are fundamentally different from previous,</p>
<p>from homo sapiens.</p>
<p>I call us homo techno.</p>
<p>I think we have evolved into homo techno,</p>
<p>which is like essentially a new species.</p>
<p>Previous technologies, I mean,</p>
<p>may have even been more profound</p>
<p>and moved us to a certain degree,</p>
<p>but I think the computers are what make us homo techno.</p>
<p>I think this is what, it&rsquo;s a brain augmentation.</p>
<p>So it like allows for actual evolution.</p>
<p>Like the computers accelerate the degree</p>
<p>to which all the other technologies can also be accelerated.</p>
<p>Would you classify yourself as a homo sapien or a homo techno?</p>
<p>Definitely homo techno.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re one of the earliest of the species.</p>
<p>I think most of us are.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Grimes,</p>
<p>an artist, musician, songwriter, producer, director,</p>
<p>and a fascinating human being</p>
<p>who thinks a lot about both the history</p>
<p>and the future of human civilization.</p>
<p>Studying the dark periods of our past</p>
<p>to help form an optimistic vision of our future.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Grimes.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, the cloud lifter, there you go.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>You know your stuff.</p>
<p>Have you ever used a cloud lifter?</p>
<p>Yeah, I actually, this microphone cloud lifter</p>
<p>is what Michael Jackson used, so.</p>
<p>No, really?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is like Thriller and stuff.</p>
<p>This mic and a cloud lifter?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a incredible microphone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very flattering on vocals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used this a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great for demo vocals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great in a room.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s easier to record vocals</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re just in a room and the music&rsquo;s playing</p>
<p>and you just wanna feel it so it&rsquo;s not in the headphones.</p>
<p>And this mic is pretty directional,</p>
<p>so I think it&rsquo;s a good mic for just vibing out</p>
<p>and just getting a real good vocal take.</p>
<p>Just vibing, just in a room.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is the Michael Jackson, Quincy Jones</p>
<p>microphone.</p>
<p>I feel way more badass now.</p>
<p>All right, you wanna just get into it?</p>
<p>I guess so.</p>
<p>All right, one of your names, at least in this space</p>
<p>and time, is C, like the letter C.</p>
<p>And you told me that C means a lot of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the speed of light.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the render rate of the universe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s yes in Spanish.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the crescent moon.</p>
<p>And it happens to be my favorite programming language</p>
<p>because it basically runs the world,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also powerful, fast, and it&rsquo;s dangerous</p>
<p>because you can mess things up really bad with it</p>
<p>because of all the pointers.</p>
<p>But anyway, which of these associations</p>
<p>will the name C is the coolest to you?</p>
<p>I mean, to me, the coolest is the speed of light,</p>
<p>obviously, or the speed of light.</p>
<p>When I say render rate of the universe,</p>
<p>I think I mean the speed of light</p>
<p>because essentially that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re rendering at.</p>
<p>See, I think we&rsquo;ll know if we&rsquo;re in a simulation</p>
<p>if the speed of light changes</p>
<p>because if they can improve their render speed, then.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s already pretty good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already pretty good, but if it improves,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;ll know, we can probably be like,</p>
<p>okay, they&rsquo;ve updated or upgraded.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s fast enough for us humans</p>
<p>because it seems immediate.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no delay, there&rsquo;s no latency</p>
<p>in terms of us humans on Earth interacting with things.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re like intergalactic species</p>
<p>operating on a much larger scale,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re gonna start noticing some weird stuff.</p>
<p>Or if you can operate in like around a black hole,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re gonna start to see some render issues.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t go faster than the speed of light, correct?</p>
<p>So it really limits our ability</p>
<p>or one&rsquo;s ability to travel space.</p>
<p>Theoretically, you can, you have wormholes.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s nothing in general relativity</p>
<p>that precludes faster than the speed of light travel.</p>
<p>But it just seems you&rsquo;re gonna have to do</p>
<p>some really funky stuff with very heavy things</p>
<p>that have like weirdnesses,</p>
<p>that have basically terrors in space time.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know how to do that.</p>
<p>Do navigators know how to do it?</p>
<p>Do navigators? Yeah.</p>
<p>Folding space, basically making wormholes.</p>
<p>So the name C. Yes.</p>
<p>Who are you?</p>
<p>Do you think of yourself as multiple people?</p>
<p>Are you one person?</p>
<p>Do you know, like in this morning,</p>
<p>were you a different person than you are tonight?</p>
<p>We are, I should say, recording this basically at midnight,</p>
<p>which is awesome. Yes, thank you so much.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m about eight hours late.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re right on time.</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>This is the beginning of a new day soon.</p>
<p>Anyway, are you the same person</p>
<p>you were in the morning and the evening?</p>
<p>Is there multiple people in there?</p>
<p>Do you think of yourself as one person?</p>
<p>Or maybe you have no clue?</p>
<p>Or are you just a giant mystery to yourself?</p>
<p>Okay, these are really intense questions, but.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Because I asked this myself, like look in the mirror,</p>
<p>who are you?</p>
<p>People tell you to just be yourself,</p>
<p>but what does that even mean?</p>
<p>I mean, I think my personality changes</p>
<p>with everyone I talk to.</p>
<p>So I have a very inconsistent personality.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Person to person, so the interaction,</p>
<p>your personality materializes.</p>
<p>Or my mood.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ll go from being like a megalomaniac</p>
<p>to being like, you know, just like a total hermit</p>
<p>who is very shy.</p>
<p>So some combinatorial combination of your mood</p>
<p>and the person you&rsquo;re interacting with.</p>
<p>Yeah, mood and people I&rsquo;m interacting with.</p>
<p>But I think everyone&rsquo;s like that.</p>
<p>Maybe not.</p>
<p>Well, not everybody acknowledges it</p>
<p>and able to introspect it.</p>
<p>Who brings out, what kind of person,</p>
<p>what kind of mood brings out the best in you?</p>
<p>As an artist and as a human.</p>
<p>Can you introspect this?</p>
<p>Like my best friends, like people I can,</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m like super confident</p>
<p>and I know that they&rsquo;re gonna understand</p>
<p>everything I&rsquo;m saying, so like my best friends,</p>
<p>then when I can start being really funny,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s always my like peak mode.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like, yeah, takes a lot to get there.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about constraints.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked about constraints and limits.</p>
<p>Do those help you out as an artist or as a human being?</p>
<p>Or do they get in the way?</p>
<p>Do you like the constraints?</p>
<p>So in creating music, in creating art, in living life,</p>
<p>do you like the constraints that this world puts on you?</p>
<p>Or do you hate them?</p>
<p>If constraints are moving, then you&rsquo;re good, right?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s like as we are progressing with technology,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re changing the constraints of like artistic creation.</p>
<p>You know, making video and music and stuff</p>
<p>is getting a lot cheaper.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s constantly new technology and new software</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s making it faster and easier.</p>
<p>We have so much more freedom than we had in the 70s.</p>
<p>Like when Michael Jackson, you know,</p>
<p>when they recorded Thriller with this microphone,</p>
<p>like they had to use a mixing desk and all this stuff.</p>
<p>And like probably even get in a studio,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably really expensive</p>
<p>and you have to be a really good singer</p>
<p>and you have to know how to use</p>
<p>like the mixing desk and everything.</p>
<p>And now I can just, you know,</p>
<p>make I&rsquo;ve made a whole album on this computer.</p>
<p>I have a lot more freedom,</p>
<p>but then I&rsquo;m also constrained in different ways</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s like literally millions more artists.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a much bigger playing field.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, I also, I didn&rsquo;t learn music.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a natural musician.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know anything about actual music.</p>
<p>I just know about like the computer.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m really kind of just like messing around</p>
<p>and like trying things out.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I mean, but the nature of music is changing.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying you don&rsquo;t know actual music,</p>
<p>what music is changing.</p>
<p>Music is becoming, you&rsquo;ve talked about this,</p>
<p>is becoming, it&rsquo;s like merging with technology.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s becoming something more than just like</p>
<p>the notes on a piano.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s becoming some weird composition</p>
<p>that requires engineering skills, programming skills,</p>
<p>some kind of human robot interaction skills,</p>
<p>and still some of the same things that Michael Jackson had,</p>
<p>which is like a good ear for a good sense of taste</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s good and not the final thing</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s put together.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re allowed, you&rsquo;re enabled, empowered</p>
<p>with a laptop to layer stuff,</p>
<p>to start like layering insane amounts of stuff.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s super easy to do that.</p>
<p>I do think music production is a really underrated art form.</p>
<p>I feel like people really don&rsquo;t appreciate it.</p>
<p>When I look at publishing splits,</p>
<p>the way that people like pay producers and stuff,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s super, producers are just deeply underrated.</p>
<p>Like so many of the songs that are popular right now</p>
<p>or for the last 20 years,</p>
<p>like part of the reason they&rsquo;re popular</p>
<p>is because the production is really interesting</p>
<p>or really sick or really cool.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t think listeners,</p>
<p>like people just don&rsquo;t really understand</p>
<p>what music production is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s sort of like this weird,</p>
<p>discombobulated art form.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like a formal, because it&rsquo;s so new,</p>
<p>there isn&rsquo;t like a formal training path for it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mostly driven by like autodidacts.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s like almost everyone I know</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s good at production,</p>
<p>like they didn&rsquo;t go to music school or anything.</p>
<p>They just taught themselves.</p>
<p>Are they&rsquo;re mostly different?</p>
<p>Like the music producers, you know,</p>
<p>is there some commonalities that time together</p>
<p>or are they all just different kinds of weirdos?</p>
<p>Cause I just, I just hung out with Rick Rubin.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, Rick Rubin is like literally</p>
<p>one of the gods of music production.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s one of the people who first,</p>
<p>you know, who like made music production,</p>
<p>you know, made the production as important</p>
<p>as the actual lyrics or the notes.</p>
<p>But the thing he does, which is interesting,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can speak to that,</p>
<p>but just hanging out with him,</p>
<p>he seems to just sit there in silence,</p>
<p>close his eyes and listen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, he almost does nothing.</p>
<p>And that nothing somehow gives you freedom</p>
<p>to be the best version of yourself.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s music production somehow too,</p>
<p>which is like encouraging you to do less,</p>
<p>to simplify, to like push towards minimalism.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess, I mean,</p>
<p>I work differently from Rick Rubin</p>
<p>cause Rick Rubin produces for other artists,</p>
<p>whereas like I mostly produce for myself.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very different situation.</p>
<p>I also think Rick Rubin, he&rsquo;s in that,</p>
<p>I would say advanced category of producer</p>
<p>where like you&rsquo;ve like earned your,</p>
<p>you can have an engineer and stuff</p>
<p>and people like do the stuff for you.</p>
<p>But I usually just like do stuff myself.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re the engineer, the producer and the artist.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess I would say I&rsquo;m in the era,</p>
<p>like the post Rick Rubin era.</p>
<p>Like I come from the kind of like</p>
<p>Skrillex school of thought,</p>
<p>which is like where you are.</p>
<p>Yeah, the engineer, producer, artist.</p>
<p>Like where, I mean lately,</p>
<p>sometimes I&rsquo;ll work with a producer now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gently sort of delicately starting</p>
<p>to collaborate a bit more,</p>
<p>but like I think I&rsquo;m kind of from the,</p>
<p>like the whatever 2010s explosion of things</p>
<p>where everything became available on the computer</p>
<p>and you kind of got this like lone wizard energy thing going.</p>
<p>So you embraced being the loneliness.</p>
<p>Is the loneliness somehow an engine of creativity?</p>
<p>Like, so most of your stuff,</p>
<p>most of your creative quote unquote genius in quotes</p>
<p>is in the privacy of your mind.</p>
<p>Yes, well, it was,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>I was talking to Daniel Eck and he said,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like most artists, they have about 10 years,</p>
<p>like 10 good years.</p>
<p>And then they usually stop making their like vital shit.</p>
<p>And I feel like I&rsquo;m sort of like nearing the end</p>
<p>of my 10 years on my own.</p>
<p>So you have to become somebody else.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m in the process</p>
<p>of becoming somebody else and reinventing.</p>
<p>When I work with other people,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve never worked with other people,</p>
<p>I find that I make like, that I&rsquo;m exceptionally rejuvenated</p>
<p>and making like some of the most vital work I&rsquo;ve ever made.</p>
<p>So, because I think another human brain</p>
<p>is like one of the best tools you can possibly find.</p>
<p>Like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a funny way to put it, I love it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if a tool is like, you know,</p>
<p>whatever HP plus one or like adds some like stats</p>
<p>to your character, like another human brain</p>
<p>will like square it instead of just like adding something.</p>
<p>Double up the experience points, I love this.</p>
<p>We should also mention we&rsquo;re playing Tavern music</p>
<p>before this and which I love, which I first,</p>
<p>I think I first.</p>
<p>You had to stop the Tavern music.</p>
<p>Yeah, because it doesn&rsquo;t, the audio.</p>
<p>Okay, okay.</p>
<p>But it makes.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;ll make the podcast annoying.</p>
<p>Add it in post, add it in post.</p>
<p>No one will want to listen to the podcast.</p>
<p>They probably would, but it makes me,</p>
<p>it reminds me like of a video game,</p>
<p>like a role playing video game</p>
<p>where you have experience points.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something really joyful about wandering places</p>
<p>like Elder Scrolls, like Skyrim,</p>
<p>just exploring these landscapes in another world</p>
<p>and then you get experience points</p>
<p>and you can work on different skills</p>
<p>and somehow you progress in life.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s simple.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have some of the messy complexities of life</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s usually a bad guy you can fight in Skyrim.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dragons and so on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure in Elden Ring,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of monsters you can fight.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>I feel like Elden Ring,</p>
<p>I feel like this is a good analogy</p>
<p>to music production though</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, I feel like the engineers</p>
<p>and the people creating these open worlds are,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of like similar to people, to music producers</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like this hidden archetype</p>
<p>that like no one really understands what they do</p>
<p>and no one really knows who they are,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re like, it&rsquo;s like the artist engineer</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s both art</p>
<p>and fairly complex engineering.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re saying they don&rsquo;t get enough credit.</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t you kind of changing that</p>
<p>by becoming the person doing everything?</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t you, isn&rsquo;t the engineer?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, others have gone before me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, you know, there&rsquo;s like Timbaland and Skrillex</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s all these people that are like,</p>
<p>you know, very famous for this,</p>
<p>but I just think the general,</p>
<p>I think people get confused about what it is</p>
<p>and just don&rsquo;t really know what it is per se</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just when I see a song,</p>
<p>like when there&rsquo;s like a hit song,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m just trying to think of like,</p>
<p>just going for like even just a basic pop hit,</p>
<p>like, what&rsquo;s it?</p>
<p>Like Rules by Dua Lipa or something.</p>
<p>The production on that is actually like really crazy.</p>
<p>I mean, the song is also great,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like the production is exceptionally memorable.</p>
<p>Like, you know, and it&rsquo;s just like no one,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t even know who produced that song.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, isn&rsquo;t part of like the rhetoric</p>
<p>of how we just discuss the creation of art.</p>
<p>We just sort of like don&rsquo;t consider the music producer</p>
<p>because I think the music producer used to be more</p>
<p>just simply recording things.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>because when you think about movies,</p>
<p>we talk about the actor and the actresses,</p>
<p>but we also talk about the directors.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t talk about like that with the music as often.</p>
<p>The Beatles music producer</p>
<p>was one of the first kind of guy,</p>
<p>one of the first people sort of introducing</p>
<p>crazy sound design into pop music.</p>
<p>I forget his name.</p>
<p>He has the same, I forget his name,</p>
<p>but you know, like he was doing all the weird stuff</p>
<p>like dropping pianos and like, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, to get the, yeah, yeah, yeah,</p>
<p>to get the sound, to get the authentic sound.</p>
<p>What about lyrics?</p>
<p>You think those, where did they fit</p>
<p>into how important they are?</p>
<p>I was heartbroken to learn</p>
<p>that Elvis didn&rsquo;t write his songs.</p>
<p>I was very mad.</p>
<p>A lot of people don&rsquo;t write their songs.</p>
<p>I understand this, but.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>I feel like there&rsquo;s this desire for authenticity.</p>
<p>I used to be like really mad</p>
<p>when like people wouldn&rsquo;t write or produce their music</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d be like, that&rsquo;s fake.</p>
<p>And then I realized there&rsquo;s all this like weird bitterness</p>
<p>and like agronus in art about authenticity.</p>
<p>But I had this kind of like weird realization recently</p>
<p>where I started thinking that like art</p>
<p>is sort of a decentralized collective thing.</p>
<p>Like art is kind of a conversation</p>
<p>with all the artists that have ever lived before you.</p>
<p>You know, like it&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re really just sort of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like anyone&rsquo;s reinventing the wheel here.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re kind of just taking, you know,</p>
<p>thousands of years of art</p>
<p>and like running it through your own little algorithm</p>
<p>and then like making your interpretation of it.</p>
<p>You just joined the conversation</p>
<p>with all the other artists that came before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a beautiful way to look at it.</p>
<p>Like, and it&rsquo;s like, I feel like everyone&rsquo;s always like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all this copyright and IP and this and that</p>
<p>or authenticity.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like, I think we need to stop seeing this</p>
<p>as this like egotistical thing of like,</p>
<p>oh, the creative genius, the lone creative genius</p>
<p>or this or that.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s like, I think art shouldn&rsquo;t be about that.</p>
<p>I think art is something that sort of</p>
<p>brings humanity together.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also, art is also kind of the collective memory</p>
<p>of humans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, we don&rsquo;t give a fuck about</p>
<p>whatever ancient Egypt,</p>
<p>like how much grain got sent that day</p>
<p>and sending the records and like, you know,</p>
<p>like who went where and, you know,</p>
<p>how many shields needed to be produced for this.</p>
<p>Like we just remember their art.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, you know, it&rsquo;s like in our day to day life,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all this stuff that seems more important than art</p>
<p>because it helps us function and survive.</p>
<p>But when all this is gone,</p>
<p>like the only thing that&rsquo;s really gonna be left is the art.</p>
<p>The technology will be obsolete.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so fascinating.</p>
<p>Like the humans will be dead.</p>
<p>That is true.</p>
<p>A good compression of human history</p>
<p>is the art we&rsquo;ve generated across the different centuries,</p>
<p>the different millennia.</p>
<p>So when the aliens come.</p>
<p>When the aliens come,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna find the hieroglyphics and the pyramids.</p>
<p>I mean, art could be broadly defined.</p>
<p>They might find like the engineering marvels,</p>
<p>the bridges, the rockets, the.</p>
<p>I guess I sort of classify though.</p>
<p>Architecture is art too.</p>
<p>I consider engineering in those formats to be art, for sure.</p>
<p>It sucks that like digital art is easier to delete.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s an apocalypse, a nuclear war,</p>
<p>that can disappear.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And the physical.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something still valuable</p>
<p>about the physical manifestation of art.</p>
<p>That sucks that like music, for example,</p>
<p>has to be played by somebody.</p>
<p>Yeah, I do think we should have a foundation type situation</p>
<p>where we like, you know how we have like seed banks</p>
<p>up in the north and stuff?</p>
<p>Like we should probably have like a solar powered</p>
<p>or geothermal little bunker</p>
<p>that like has all human knowledge.</p>
<p>You mentioned Daniel Ek and Spotify.</p>
<p>What do you think about that as an artist?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s Spotify?</p>
<p>Is that empowering?</p>
<p>To me, Spotify as a consumer is super exciting.</p>
<p>It makes it easy for me to access music</p>
<p>from all kinds of artists,</p>
<p>get to explore all kinds of music,</p>
<p>make it super easy to sort of curate my own playlist</p>
<p>and have fun with all that.</p>
<p>It was so liberating to let go.</p>
<p>You know, I used to collect, you know,</p>
<p>albums and CDs and so on, like horde albums.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like they matter.</p>
<p>But the reality you could, you know,</p>
<p>that was really liberating that I could let go of that.</p>
<p>And letting go of the albums you&rsquo;re kind of collecting</p>
<p>allows you to find new music,</p>
<p>exploring new artists and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But I know from a perspective of an artist that could be,</p>
<p>like you mentioned,</p>
<p>competition could be a kind of constraint</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s more and more and more artists</p>
<p>on the platform.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s better that there&rsquo;s more artists.</p>
<p>I mean, again, this might be propaganda</p>
<p>because this is all from a conversation with Daniel Ek.</p>
<p>So this could easily be propaganda.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all a victim of somebody&rsquo;s propaganda.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just accept this.</p>
<p>But Daniel Ek was telling me that, you know,</p>
<p>at the, because I, you know, when I met him,</p>
<p>I came in all furious about Spotify</p>
<p>and like I grilled him super hard.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve got his answers here.</p>
<p>But he was saying like at the sort of peak</p>
<p>of the CD industry,</p>
<p>there was like 20,000 artists making millions</p>
<p>and millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Like there was just like a very tiny kind of 1%.</p>
<p>And Spotify has kind of democratized the industry</p>
<p>because now I think he said there&rsquo;s about a million artists</p>
<p>making a good living from Spotify.</p>
<p>And when I heard that, I was like, honestly,</p>
<p>I would rather make less money</p>
<p>and have just like a decent living</p>
<p>and have more artists be able to have that,</p>
<p>even though I like, I wish it could include everyone, but.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s really hard to argue with.</p>
<p>YouTube is the same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s YouTube&rsquo;s mission.</p>
<p>They want to basically have as many creators as possible</p>
<p>and make a living, some kind of living.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s so hard to argue with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so hard.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s better ways to do it.</p>
<p>My manager, I actually wish he was here.</p>
<p>Like I would have brought him up.</p>
<p>My manager is building an app that can manage you.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;ll like help you organize your percentages</p>
<p>and get your publishing and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.</p>
<p>So you can take out all the middlemen</p>
<p>so you can have a much bigger,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll just like automate it.</p>
<p>So you can get.</p>
<p>So automate the manager?</p>
<p>Automate management, publishing,</p>
<p>and legal, it can read,</p>
<p>the app he&rsquo;s building can read your contract</p>
<p>and like tell you about it.</p>
<p>Because one of the issues with music right now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that we&rsquo;re not getting paid enough,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s that the art industry is filled with middlemen</p>
<p>because artists are not good at business.</p>
<p>And from the beginning, like Frank Sinatra,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all mob stuff.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s the music industry is run by business people,</p>
<p>not the artists and the artists really get very small cuts</p>
<p>of like what they make.</p>
<p>And so I think part of the reason I&rsquo;m a technocrat,</p>
<p>which I mean, your fans are gonna be technocrats.</p>
<p>So no one&rsquo;s, they&rsquo;re not gonna be mad at me about this,</p>
<p>but like my fans hate it when I say this kind of thing</p>
<p>or the general public.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t like technocrats.</p>
<p>Like when I watched Battle Angel Alita</p>
<p>and they were like the Martian technocracy</p>
<p>and I was like, yeah, Martian technocracy.</p>
<p>And then they were like, and they&rsquo;re evil.</p>
<p>And I was like, oh, okay.</p>
<p>I was like, cause Martian technocracy sounds sick to me.</p>
<p>Yeah, so your intuition as technocrats</p>
<p>would create some kind of beautiful world.</p>
<p>For example, what my manager&rsquo;s working on,</p>
<p>if you can create an app that removes the need for a lawyer</p>
<p>and then you could have smart contracts on the blockchain,</p>
<p>removes the need for like management</p>
<p>and organizing all this stuff,</p>
<p>like can read your stuff and explain it to you,</p>
<p>can collect your royalties, you know,</p>
<p>like then the small amounts,</p>
<p>the amount of money that you&rsquo;re getting from Spotify</p>
<p>actually means a lot more and goes a lot farther.</p>
<p>It can remove some of the bureaucracy,</p>
<p>some of the inefficiencies that make life</p>
<p>not as great as it could be.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the issue isn&rsquo;t that there&rsquo;s not enough.</p>
<p>Like the issue is that there&rsquo;s inefficiency</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m really into this positive sum mindset,</p>
<p>you know, the win, win mindset of like,</p>
<p>instead of, you know, fighting over the scraps,</p>
<p>how do we make the, or worrying about scarcity,</p>
<p>like instead of a scarcity mindset,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t we just increase the efficiency</p>
<p>and, you know, in that way.</p>
<p>Expand the size of the pie.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about experimentation.</p>
<p>So you said, which is beautiful,</p>
<p>being a musician is like having a conversation</p>
<p>with all those that came before you.</p>
<p>How much of creating music is like</p>
<p>kind of having that conversation,</p>
<p>trying to fit into the cultural trends</p>
<p>and how much of it is like trying to,</p>
<p>as much as possible, be an outsider</p>
<p>and come up with something totally new.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when you&rsquo;re thinking,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re experimenting,</p>
<p>are you trying to be totally different, totally weird?</p>
<p>Are you trying to fit in?</p>
<p>Man, this is so hard because I feel like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>kind of in the process of semi retiring from music,</p>
<p>so this is like my old brain.</p>
<p>Yeah, bring it from like the shelf,</p>
<p>put it on the table for a couple minutes,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll just poke it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a bit of both</p>
<p>because I think forcing yourself to engage with new music</p>
<p>is really great for neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Like I think, you know, as people,</p>
<p>part of the reason music is marketed at young people</p>
<p>is because young people are very neuroplastic.</p>
<p>So like if you&rsquo;re 16 to like 23 or whatever,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be really easy for you to love new music.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re older than that,</p>
<p>it gets harder and harder and harder.</p>
<p>And I think one of the beautiful things</p>
<p>about being a musician is I just constantly force myself</p>
<p>to listen to new music</p>
<p>and I think it keeps my brain really plastic.</p>
<p>And I think this is a really good exercise.</p>
<p>I just think everyone should do this.</p>
<p>You listen to new music and you hate it,</p>
<p>I think you should just keep, force yourself to like,</p>
<p>okay, well why do people like it?</p>
<p>And like, you know, make your brain form new neural pathways</p>
<p>and be more open to change.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really brilliant actually.</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt, but like that exercise</p>
<p>is really amazing to sort of embrace change,</p>
<p>embrace sort of practice neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Because like that&rsquo;s one of the things,</p>
<p>you fall in love with a certain band</p>
<p>and you just kind of stay with that for the rest of your life</p>
<p>and then you never understand the modern music.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really good exercise.</p>
<p>Most of the streaming on Spotify</p>
<p>is like classic rock and stuff.</p>
<p>Like new music makes up a very small chunk</p>
<p>of what is played on Spotify.</p>
<p>And I think this is like not a good sign for us as a species.</p>
<p>I think, yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a good measure of the species open mindedness</p>
<p>to change is how often you listen to new music.</p>
<p>The brain, let&rsquo;s put the music brain back on the shelf.</p>
<p>I gotta pull out the futurist brain for a second.</p>
<p>In what wild ways do you think the future,</p>
<p>say in like 30 years, maybe 50 years,</p>
<p>maybe a hundred years will be different</p>
<p>from our current way of life on earth?</p>
<p>We can talk about augmented reality, virtual reality,</p>
<p>maybe robots, maybe space travel, maybe video games,</p>
<p>maybe genetic engineering.</p>
<p>I can keep going.</p>
<p>Cyborgs, aliens, world wars,</p>
<p>maybe destructive nuclear wars, good and bad.</p>
<p>When you think about the future, what are you imagining?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the weirdest and the wildest it could be?</p>
<p>Have you read Surface Detail by Iain Banks?</p>
<p>Surface Detail is my favorite depiction of a,</p>
<p>oh wow, you have to read this book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally the greatest science fiction book</p>
<p>possibly ever written.</p>
<p>Iain Banks is the man, yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>What have you read?</p>
<p>Just the Player of Games.</p>
<p>I read that titles can&rsquo;t be copyrighted</p>
<p>so you can just steal them.</p>
<p>And I was like, Player of Games, sick.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you can name your album.</p>
<p>Like I always wanted to.</p>
<p>Romeo and Juliet or something.</p>
<p>I always wanted to name an album War and Peace.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Like that would be, like you.</p>
<p>That is a good, that&rsquo;s a good,</p>
<p>where have I heard that before?</p>
<p>You can do that, like you could do that.</p>
<p>Also things that are in the public domain.</p>
<p>For people who have no clue,</p>
<p>you do have a song called Player of Games.</p>
<p>Yes, oh yeah.</p>
<p>So Iain Banks, Surface Detail is in my opinion</p>
<p>the best future that I&rsquo;ve ever read about</p>
<p>or heard about in science fiction.</p>
<p>Basically there&rsquo;s the relationship with super intelligence,</p>
<p>like artificial super intelligence is just, it&rsquo;s like great.</p>
<p>I want to credit the person who coined this term</p>
<p>because I love this term.</p>
<p>And I feel like young women don&rsquo;t get enough credit in.</p>
<p>Yeah, so if you go to Protopia Futures on Instagram,</p>
<p>what is her name?</p>
<p>Personalized donor experience at scale,</p>
<p>our AI power donor experience.</p>
<p>Monica Bealskite, I&rsquo;m saying that wrong.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m probably gonna, I&rsquo;m probably butchering this a bit,</p>
<p>but Protopia is sort of, if utopia is unattainable,</p>
<p>Protopia is sort of like, you know.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s an awesome Instagram, Protopia Futures.</p>
<p>A great, a future that is, you know, as good as we can get.</p>
<p>The future, positive future.</p>
<p>AI, is this a centralized AI in Surface Detail</p>
<p>or is it distributed?</p>
<p>What kind of AI is it?</p>
<p>They mostly exist as giant super ships,</p>
<p>like sort of like the guild ships in Dune.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re these giant ships that kind of move people</p>
<p>around and the ships are sentient</p>
<p>and they can talk to all the passengers.</p>
<p>And I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of different types of AI</p>
<p>in the Banksyan future,</p>
<p>but in the opening scene of Surface Detail,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this place called the Culture</p>
<p>and the Culture is basically a Protopian future.</p>
<p>And a Protopian future, I think,</p>
<p>is like a future that is like,</p>
<p>obviously it&rsquo;s not utopia, it&rsquo;s not perfect.</p>
<p>And like, cause like striving for utopia,</p>
<p>I think feels hopeless and it&rsquo;s sort of like,</p>
<p>maybe not the best terminology to be using.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s a pretty good place.</p>
<p>Like mostly like, you know,</p>
<p>super intelligence and biological beings</p>
<p>exist fairly in harmony.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not too much war.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like as close to equality as you can get,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s like approximately a good future.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s really awesome stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, and in the opening scene,</p>
<p>this girl, she&rsquo;s born as a sex slave outside of the culture.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s in a society that doesn&rsquo;t adhere</p>
<p>to the cultural values.</p>
<p>She tries to kill the guy who is her like master,</p>
<p>but he kills her, but unbeknownst to her,</p>
<p>when she was traveling on a ship through the culture</p>
<p>with him one day, a ship put a neural lace</p>
<p>in her head and neural lace is sort of like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically a Neuralink because life imitates art.</p>
<p>It does indeed.</p>
<p>So she wakes up and the opening scene is her memory</p>
<p>has been uploaded by this neural lace</p>
<p>when she has been killed.</p>
<p>And now she gets to choose a new body.</p>
<p>And this AI is interfacing with her recorded memory</p>
<p>in her neural lace and helping her and being like,</p>
<p>hello, you&rsquo;re dead.</p>
<p>But because you had a neural lace, your memory&rsquo;s uploaded.</p>
<p>Do you want to choose a new body?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to be born here in the culture</p>
<p>and like start a new life, which is just,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like the opening.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like so sick.</p>
<p>And the ship is the super intelligence.</p>
<p>All the ships are kind of super intelligence.</p>
<p>But they still want to preserve a kind of rich,</p>
<p>fulfilling experience for the humans.</p>
<p>Yeah, like they&rsquo;re like friends with the humans.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a bunch of ships that don&rsquo;t want to exist</p>
<p>with biological beings, but they just have their own place</p>
<p>like way over there.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t, they just do their own thing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not necessarily.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a pretty, this protopian existence is pretty peaceful.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, and then, for example,</p>
<p>one of the main fights in the book is they&rsquo;re fighting,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s these artificial hells that,</p>
<p>and people don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s ethical to have artificial hell.</p>
<p>Like basically when people do crime, they get sent,</p>
<p>like when they die, their memory gets sent</p>
<p>to an artificial hell and they&rsquo;re eternally tortured.</p>
<p>And so, and then the way that society is deciding</p>
<p>whether or not to have the artificial hell</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;re having these simulated,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re having like a simulated war.</p>
<p>So instead of actual blood, you know,</p>
<p>people are basically essentially fighting in a video game</p>
<p>to choose the outcome of this.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re still experiencing the suffering</p>
<p>in this artificial hell or no?</p>
<p>Can you experience stuff or?</p>
<p>So the artificial hell sucks.</p>
<p>And a lot of people in the culture want to get rid</p>
<p>of the artificial hell.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a simulated wars,</p>
<p>are they happening in the artificial hell?</p>
<p>So no, the simulated wars are happening</p>
<p>outside of the artificial hell,</p>
<p>between the political factions who are,</p>
<p>so this political faction says we should have simulated hell</p>
<p>to deter crime.</p>
<p>And this political faction is saying,</p>
<p>no, simulated hell is unethical.</p>
<p>And so instead of like having, you know,</p>
<p>blowing each other up with nukes,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re having like a giant Fortnite battle</p>
<p>to decide this, which, you know, to me that&rsquo;s protopia.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, okay, we can have war without death.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t think there should be simulated hells.</p>
<p>I think that is definitely one of the ways</p>
<p>in which technology could go very, very, very, very wrong.</p>
<p>So almost punishing people in a digital space</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, like torturing people&rsquo;s memories.</p>
<p>So either as a deterrent, like if you committed a crime,</p>
<p>but also just for personal pleasure,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s some sick, demented humans in this world.</p>
<p>Dan Carlin actually has this</p>
<p>episode of Hardcore History on painful attainment.</p>
<p>Oh, that episode is fucked.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dark, because he kind of goes through human history</p>
<p>and says like, we as humans seem to enjoy,</p>
<p>secretly enjoy or used to be openly enjoy</p>
<p>sort of the torture and the death,</p>
<p>watching the death and torture of other humans.</p>
<p>I do think if people were consenting,</p>
<p>we should be allowed to have gladiatorial matches.</p>
<p>But consent is hard to achieve in those situations.</p>
<p>It always starts getting slippery.</p>
<p>Like it could be also forced consent,</p>
<p>like it starts getting weird.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s way too much excitement.</p>
<p>Like this is what he highlights.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about human nature</p>
<p>that wants to see that violence.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really dark.</p>
<p>And you hope that we can sort of overcome</p>
<p>that aspect of human nature,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s still within us somewhere.</p>
<p>Well, I think that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing right now.</p>
<p>I have this theory that what is very important</p>
<p>about the current moment is that all of evolution</p>
<p>has been survival of the fittest up until now.</p>
<p>And at some point, the lines are kind of fuzzy,</p>
<p>but in the recent past, or maybe even just right now,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re getting to this point</p>
<p>where we can choose intelligent design.</p>
<p>Like we probably since like the integration of the iPhone,</p>
<p>like we are becoming cyborgs.</p>
<p>Like our brains are fundamentally changed.</p>
<p>Everyone who grew up with electronics,</p>
<p>we are fundamentally different from previous,</p>
<p>from homo sapiens.</p>
<p>I call us homo techno.</p>
<p>I think we have evolved into homo techno,</p>
<p>which is like essentially a new species.</p>
<p>Like if you look at the way,</p>
<p>if you took an MRI of my brain</p>
<p>and you took an MRI of like a medieval brain,</p>
<p>I think it would be very different</p>
<p>the way that it has evolved.</p>
<p>Do you think when historians look back at this time,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll see like this was a fundamental shift</p>
<p>to what a human being is?</p>
<p>I think, I do not think we are still homo sapiens.</p>
<p>I believe we are homo techno.</p>
<p>And I think we have evolved.</p>
<p>And I think right now, the way we are evolving,</p>
<p>we can choose how we do that.</p>
<p>And I think we are being very reckless</p>
<p>about how we&rsquo;re doing that.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re just having social media,</p>
<p>but I think this idea that like this is a time</p>
<p>to choose intelligent design should be taken very seriously.</p>
<p>It like now is the moment to reprogram the human computer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, if you go blind,</p>
<p>your visual cortex will get taken over</p>
<p>with other functions.</p>
<p>We can choose our own evolution.</p>
<p>We can change the way our brains work.</p>
<p>And so we actually have a huge responsibility to do that.</p>
<p>And I think I&rsquo;m not sure who should be responsible for that,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s definitely not adequate education.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re being inundated with all this technology</p>
<p>that is fundamentally changing</p>
<p>the physical structure of our brains.</p>
<p>And we are not adequately responding to that</p>
<p>to choose how we wanna evolve.</p>
<p>And we could evolve, we could be really whatever we want.</p>
<p>And I think this is a really important time.</p>
<p>And I think if we choose correctly and we choose wisely,</p>
<p>consciousness could exist for a very long time</p>
<p>and integration with AI could be extremely positive.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think enough people are focusing</p>
<p>on this specific situation.</p>
<p>Do you think we might irreversibly screw things up</p>
<p>if we get things wrong now?</p>
<p>Because the flip side of that,</p>
<p>it seems humans are pretty adaptive.</p>
<p>So maybe the way we figure things out</p>
<p>is by screwing it up, like social media.</p>
<p>Over a generation, we&rsquo;ll see the negative effects</p>
<p>of social media, and then we build new social medias,</p>
<p>and we just keep improving stuff.</p>
<p>And then we learn from the failures of the past.</p>
<p>Because humans seem to be really adaptive.</p>
<p>On the flip side, we can get it wrong in a way</p>
<p>where literally we create weapons of war</p>
<p>or increase hate.</p>
<p>Past a certain threshold, we really do a lot of damage.</p>
<p>I mean, I think we&rsquo;re optimized</p>
<p>to notice the negative things.</p>
<p>But I would actually say one of the things</p>
<p>that I think people aren&rsquo;t noticing</p>
<p>is if you look at Silicon Valley</p>
<p>and you look at the technocracy,</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s been happening there.</p>
<p>When Silicon Valley started, it was all just Facebook</p>
<p>and all this for profit crap</p>
<p>that really wasn&rsquo;t particular.</p>
<p>I guess it was useful, but it&rsquo;s sort of just whatever.</p>
<p>But now you see lab grown meat, compostable,</p>
<p>or biodegradable, single use cutlery,</p>
<p>or meditation apps.</p>
<p>I think we are actually evolving and changing,</p>
<p>and technology is changing.</p>
<p>I think there just maybe there isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>quite enough education about this.</p>
<p>And also, I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s quite enough incentive</p>
<p>for it because I think the way capitalism works,</p>
<p>what we define as profit,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re also working on an old model</p>
<p>of what we define as profit.</p>
<p>I really think if we changed the idea of profit</p>
<p>to include social good,</p>
<p>you can have economic profit,</p>
<p>social good also counting as profit</p>
<p>would incentivize things that are more useful</p>
<p>and more whatever spiritual technology</p>
<p>or positive technology or things that help reprogram</p>
<p>a human computer in a good way</p>
<p>or things that help us intelligently design our new brains.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s no reason why within the framework</p>
<p>of capitalism, the word profit or the idea of profit</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t also incorporate the well being of a human being.</p>
<p>So like long term well being, long term happiness.</p>
<p>Or even for example, we were talking about motherhood,</p>
<p>like part of the reason I&rsquo;m so late</p>
<p>is because I had to get the baby to bed.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, I keep thinking about motherhood,</p>
<p>how under capitalism, it&rsquo;s like this extremely essential job</p>
<p>that is very difficult that is not compensated.</p>
<p>And we sort of like value things</p>
<p>by how much we compensate them.</p>
<p>And so we really devalue motherhood in our society</p>
<p>and pretty much all societies.</p>
<p>Like capitalism does not recognize motherhood.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a job that you&rsquo;re supposed to do for free.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, but I feel like producing great humans</p>
<p>should be seen as a great, as profit under capitalism.</p>
<p>Like that should be, that&rsquo;s like a huge social good.</p>
<p>Like every awesome human that gets made</p>
<p>adds so much to the world.</p>
<p>So like if that was integrated into the profit structure,</p>
<p>then, you know, and if we potentially found a way</p>
<p>to compensate motherhood.</p>
<p>So come up with a compensation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s much broader than just money or.</p>
<p>Or it could just be money.</p>
<p>Like, what if you just made, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;d pay for that.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, that&rsquo;s where you start getting into.</p>
<p>Reallocation of resources that people get upset over.</p>
<p>Well, like what if we made like a motherhood Dow?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And, you know, used it to fund like single mothers,</p>
<p>like, you know, pay for making babies.</p>
<p>So, I mean, if you create and put beautiful things</p>
<p>onto the world, that could be companies,</p>
<p>that can be bridges, that could be art,</p>
<p>that could be a lot of things,</p>
<p>and that could be children, which are.</p>
<p>Or education or.</p>
<p>Anything, that should be valued by society,</p>
<p>and that should be somehow incorporated into the framework</p>
<p>of what, as a market, of what.</p>
<p>Like, if you contribute children to this world,</p>
<p>that should be valued and respected</p>
<p>and sort of celebrated, like, proportional to what it is,</p>
<p>which is, it&rsquo;s the thing that fuels human civilization.</p>
<p>Yeah, like I. It&rsquo;s kind of important.</p>
<p>I feel like everyone&rsquo;s always saying,</p>
<p>I mean, I think we&rsquo;re in very different social spheres,</p>
<p>but everyone&rsquo;s always saying, like, dismantle capitalism.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, well, okay, well,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the government should own everything.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t think we should not have private ownership.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s scary.</p>
<p>You know, like that starts getting into weird stuff</p>
<p>and just sort of like,</p>
<p>I feel there&rsquo;s almost no way to do that</p>
<p>without a police state, you know?</p>
<p>But obviously, capitalism has some major flaws.</p>
<p>And I think actually Mac showed me this idea</p>
<p>called social capitalism, which is a form of capitalism</p>
<p>that just like considers social good to be also profit.</p>
<p>Like, you know, it&rsquo;s like, right now companies need to,</p>
<p>like, you&rsquo;re supposed to grow every quarter or whatever</p>
<p>to like show that you&rsquo;re functioning well,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, okay, well,</p>
<p>what if you kept the same amount of profit?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still in the green,</p>
<p>but then you have also all this social good.</p>
<p>Like, do you really need all this extra economic growth</p>
<p>or could you add this social good and that counts?</p>
<p>And, you know, I don&rsquo;t know if, I am not an economist.</p>
<p>I have no idea how this could be achieved, but.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think economists know how anything</p>
<p>could be achieved either, but they pretend.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the thing, they construct a model</p>
<p>and they go on TV shows and sound like an expert.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the definition of economist.</p>
<p>How did being a mother, becoming a mother</p>
<p>change you as a human being, would you say?</p>
<p>Man, I think it kind of changed everything</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s still changing me a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually changing me more right now in this moment</p>
<p>than it was before.</p>
<p>Like today, like this?</p>
<p>Just like in the most recent months and stuff.</p>
<p>Can you elucidate that, how change,</p>
<p>like when you wake up in the morning</p>
<p>and you look at yourself, it&rsquo;s again, which, who are you?</p>
<p>How have you become different, would you say?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just really reorienting my priorities.</p>
<p>And at first I was really fighting against that</p>
<p>because I somehow felt it was like a failure</p>
<p>of feminism or something.</p>
<p>Like I felt like it was like bad</p>
<p>if like my kids started mattering more than my work.</p>
<p>And then like more recently I started sort of analyzing</p>
<p>that thought in myself and being like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also kind of a construct.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;ve just devalued motherhood so much</p>
<p>in our culture that like, I feel guilty for caring</p>
<p>about my kids more than I care about my work.</p>
<p>So feminism includes breaking out</p>
<p>of whatever the construct is.</p>
<p>So just continually breaking,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like freedom empower you to be free.</p>
<p>And that means&hellip;</p>
<p>But it also, but like being a mother,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m so much more creative.</p>
<p>Like I cannot believe the massive amount</p>
<p>of brain growth that I am.</p>
<p>Why do you think that is?</p>
<p>Just cause like the stakes are higher somehow?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s just so trippy</p>
<p>watching consciousness emerge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, it&rsquo;s like going on a crazy journey</p>
<p>or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the craziest science fiction novel</p>
<p>you could ever read.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so crazy watching consciousness come into being.</p>
<p>And then at the same time,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re forced to value your time so much.</p>
<p>Like when I have creative time now, it&rsquo;s so sacred.</p>
<p>I need to like be really fricking on it.</p>
<p>But the other thing is that I used to just be like a cynic</p>
<p>and I used to just wanna&hellip;</p>
<p>Like my last album was called Miss Anthropocene</p>
<p>and it was like this like, it was like a study in villainy</p>
<p>or like it was like, well, what if we have,</p>
<p>instead of the old gods, we have like new gods</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like Miss Anthropocene is like misanthrope</p>
<p>like and Anthropocene, which is like the, you know,</p>
<p>like and she&rsquo;s the goddess of climate change or whatever.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like destroying the world.</p>
<p>And it was just like, it was like dark</p>
<p>and it was like a study in villainy.</p>
<p>And it was sort of just like,</p>
<p>like I used to like have no problem just making cynical,</p>
<p>angry, scary art.</p>
<p>And not that there&rsquo;s anything wrong with that,</p>
<p>but I think having kids just makes you such an optimist.</p>
<p>It just inherently makes you wanna be an optimist so bad</p>
<p>that like I feel more responsibility</p>
<p>to make more optimistic things.</p>
<p>And I get a lot of shit for it</p>
<p>because everyone&rsquo;s like, oh, you&rsquo;re so privileged.</p>
<p>Stop talking about like pie in the sky,</p>
<p>stupid concepts and focus on like the now.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like, I think if we don&rsquo;t ideate</p>
<p>about futures that could be good,</p>
<p>we won&rsquo;t be able to get them.</p>
<p>If everything is Blade Runner,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re gonna end up with Blade Runner.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, as we said earlier, life imitates art.</p>
<p>Like life really does imitate art.</p>
<p>And so we really need more protopian or utopian art.</p>
<p>I think this is incredibly essential</p>
<p>for the future of humanity.</p>
<p>And I think the current discourse</p>
<p>where that&rsquo;s seen as a thinking about protopia or utopia</p>
<p>is seen as a dismissal of the problems</p>
<p>that we currently have.</p>
<p>I think that is an incorrect mindset.</p>
<p>And like having kids just makes me wanna imagine</p>
<p>amazing futures that like maybe I won&rsquo;t be able to build,</p>
<p>but they will be able to build if they want to.</p>
<p>Yeah, it does seem like ideation</p>
<p>is a precursor to creation.</p>
<p>So you have to imagine it in order to be able to build it.</p>
<p>And there is a sad thing about human nature</p>
<p>that somehow a cynical view of the world</p>
<p>is seen as a insightful view.</p>
<p>You know, cynicism is often confused for insight,</p>
<p>which is sad to see.</p>
<p>And optimism is confused for naivete.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re blinded by your,</p>
<p>maybe your privilege or whatever.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re blinded by something, but you&rsquo;re certainly blinded.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sad, that&rsquo;s sad to see</p>
<p>because it seems like the optimists</p>
<p>are the ones that create our future.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the ones that build.</p>
<p>In order to build the crazy thing,</p>
<p>you have to be optimistic.</p>
<p>You have to be either stupid or excited or passionate</p>
<p>or mad enough to actually believe that it can be built.</p>
<p>And those are the people that built it.</p>
<p>My favorite quote of all time is from Star Wars, Episode 8,</p>
<p>which I know everyone hates.</p>
<p>Do you like Star Wars, Episode 8?</p>
<p>No, yeah, probably I would say I would probably hate it, yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have strong feelings about it.</p>
<p>Let me backtrack.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have strong feelings about Star Wars.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Tolkien person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more into dragons and orcs and ogres.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, Tolkien forever.</p>
<p>I really want to have one more son and call him,</p>
<p>I thought Tao Tecno Tolkien would be cool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of T&rsquo;s, I like it.</p>
<p>Yeah, and well, and Tao is six, two, eight, two pi.</p>
<p>Yeah, Tao Tecno, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And then techno is obviously the best genre of music,</p>
<p>but also like technocracy.</p>
<p>It just sounds really good.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right, and techno Tolkien, Tao Tecno Tolkien.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Tao Tecno Tolkien, but Star Wars, Episode 8,</p>
<p>I know a lot of people have issues with it.</p>
<p>Personally, on the record,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the best Star Wars film.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re starting trouble today.</p>
<p>Yeah, but don&rsquo;t kill what you hate, save what you love.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t kill what you hate.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t kill what you hate, save what you love.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re, in society right now,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in a diagnosis mode.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just diagnosing and diagnosing and diagnosing,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re trying to kill what we hate,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not trying to save what we love enough.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this Buckminster Fuller quote,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m gonna butcher,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t remember it correctly,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s something along the lines of,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t try to destroy the old bad models,</p>
<p>render them obsolete with better models.</p>
<p>Maybe we don&rsquo;t need to destroy the oil industry.</p>
<p>Maybe we just create a great new battery technology</p>
<p>and sustainable transport,</p>
<p>and just make it economically unreasonable</p>
<p>to still continue to rely on fossil fuels.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, don&rsquo;t kill what you hate, save what you love.</p>
<p>Make new things and just render the old things unusable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if the college debt is so bad,</p>
<p>and universities are so expensive,</p>
<p>and I feel like education is becoming obsolete.</p>
<p>I feel like we could completely revolutionize education,</p>
<p>and we could make it free.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, you look at JSTOR,</p>
<p>and you have to pay to get all the studies and everything.</p>
<p>What if we created a DAO that bought JSTOR,</p>
<p>or we created a DAO that was funding studies,</p>
<p>and those studies were open source, or free for everyone.</p>
<p>And what if we just open sourced education</p>
<p>and decentralized education and made it free,</p>
<p>and all research was on the internet,</p>
<p>and all the outcomes of studies were on the internet,</p>
<p>and no one has student debt,</p>
<p>and you just take tests when you apply for a job,</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re qualified, then you can work there.</p>
<p>This is just like, I don&rsquo;t know how anything works.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just randomly ranting, but.</p>
<p>I like the humility.</p>
<p>You gotta think from just basic first principles.</p>
<p>What is the problem?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s broken?</p>
<p>What are some ideas?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And get excited about those ideas,</p>
<p>and share your excitement,</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t tear each other down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just when you kill things,</p>
<p>you often end up killing yourself.</p>
<p>Like war is not a one sided,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re not gonna go in and just kill them,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re gonna get stabbed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, and I think when I talk about this nexus point</p>
<p>of that we&rsquo;re in this point in society</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re switching to intelligent design,</p>
<p>I think part of our switch to intelligent design</p>
<p>is that we need to choose nonviolence.</p>
<p>And we need to, like, I think we can choose to start,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we can eradicate violence from our species,</p>
<p>because I think we need it a little bit,</p>
<p>but I think we can choose</p>
<p>to really reorient our primitive brains</p>
<p>that are fighting over scarcity,</p>
<p>and that are so attack oriented,</p>
<p>and move into, we can optimize for creativity and building.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s interesting to think how that happens,</p>
<p>so some of it is just education,</p>
<p>some of it is living life and introspecting your own mind,</p>
<p>and trying to live up to the better angels of your nature</p>
<p>for each one of us, all those kinds of things at scale.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we can sort of start to minimize</p>
<p>the amount of destructive war in our world,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s, to me, probably you&rsquo;re the same,</p>
<p>technology is a really promising way to do that.</p>
<p>Like, social media should be a really promising way</p>
<p>to do that, it&rsquo;s a way we connect.</p>
<p>I, you know, for the most part,</p>
<p>I really enjoy social media.</p>
<p>I just know all the negative stuff.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t engage with any of the negative stuff.</p>
<p>Just not even, like, by blocking</p>
<p>or any of that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>but just not letting it enter my mind.</p>
<p>Like, just, like, when somebody says something negative,</p>
<p>I see it, I immediately think positive thoughts about them,</p>
<p>and I just forget they exist after that.</p>
<p>Just move on, because, like, that negative energy,</p>
<p>if I return the negative energy,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to get excited in a negative way right back,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just this kind of vicious cycle.</p>
<p>But you would think technology would assist us</p>
<p>in this process of letting go,</p>
<p>of not taking things personally,</p>
<p>of not engaging in the negativity,</p>
<p>but unfortunately, social media profits from the negativity,</p>
<p>so the current models.</p>
<p>I mean, social media is like a gun.</p>
<p>Like, you should take a course before you use it.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s like, this is what I mean,</p>
<p>like, when I say reprogram the human computer.</p>
<p>Like, in school, you should learn</p>
<p>about how social media optimizes</p>
<p>to, you know, raise your cortisol levels</p>
<p>and make you angry and crazy and stressed,</p>
<p>and, like, you should learn how to have hygiene</p>
<p>about how you use social media.</p>
<p>But, so you can, yeah,</p>
<p>choose not to focus on the negative stuff, but I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure social media should,</p>
<p>I guess it should exist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re in the messy, it&rsquo;s the experimental phase.</p>
<p>Like, we&rsquo;re working it out.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s the early days.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know, when you say social media,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that even means.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in the very early days.</p>
<p>I think social media is just basic human connection</p>
<p>in the digital realm, and that, I think it should exist,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s so many ways to do it in a bad way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many ways to do it in a good way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all discussions of all the same human rights.</p>
<p>We talk about freedom of speech.</p>
<p>We talk about sort of violence</p>
<p>in the space of digital media.</p>
<p>We talk about hate speech.</p>
<p>We talk about all these things that we had to figure out</p>
<p>back in the day in the physical space.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re now figuring out in the digital space,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like baby stages.</p>
<p>When the printing press came out,</p>
<p>it was like pure chaos for a minute, you know?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when you inject,</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a massive information injection</p>
<p>into the general population, there&rsquo;s just gonna be,</p>
<p>I feel like the printing press, I don&rsquo;t have the years,</p>
<p>but it was like printing press came out,</p>
<p>shit got really fucking bad for a minute,</p>
<p>but then we got the enlightenment.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like, I think we&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>this is like the second coming of the printing press.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re probably gonna have some shitty times for a minute,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re gonna have recalibrate</p>
<p>to have a better understanding of how we consume media</p>
<p>and how we deliver media.</p>
<p>Speaking of programming the human computer,</p>
<p>you mentioned Baby X.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this young consciousness coming to be,</p>
<p>came from a cell.</p>
<p>Like that whole thing doesn&rsquo;t even make sense.</p>
<p>It came from DNA.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this baby computer</p>
<p>that just like grows and grows and grows and grows,</p>
<p>and now there&rsquo;s a conscious being</p>
<p>with extremely impressive cognitive capabilities with,</p>
<p>Have you met him?</p>
<p>Yes, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s actually really smart.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s really smart.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Or a baby.</p>
<p>He does.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know a lot of other babies,</p>
<p>but he seems to be smart.</p>
<p>Zach, I don&rsquo;t hang out with babies often,</p>
<p>but this baby was very impressive.</p>
<p>He does a lot of pranks and stuff.</p>
<p>Oh, so he&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;ll like give you a treat</p>
<p>and then take it away and laugh and like stuff like that.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s like a chess player.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a cognitive sort of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a computer being programmed.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s taking in the environment,</p>
<p>interacting with a specific set of humans.</p>
<p>How would you, first of all, what is it?</p>
<p>What, let me ask.</p>
<p>I want to ask how do you program this computer?</p>
<p>And also how do you make sense of that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a conscious being right there</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t there before?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s giving me a lot of crisis thoughts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking really hard.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s part of the reason</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m struggling to focus on</p>
<p>art and stuff right now.</p>
<p>Cause baby X is becoming conscious</p>
<p>and like my it&rsquo;s just reorienting my brain.</p>
<p>Like my brain is suddenly totally shifting of like,</p>
<p>oh shit, like the way we raise children.</p>
<p>Like, I hate all the baby books and everything.</p>
<p>I hate them.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re, oh, the art is so bad.</p>
<p>And like all this stuff, everything about all the aesthetics.</p>
<p>And like, I&rsquo;m just like, ah, like this is so.</p>
<p>The programming languages we&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>to program these baby computers isn&rsquo;t good.</p>
<p>Yeah, like I&rsquo;m thinking, and I,</p>
<p>not that I have like good answers</p>
<p>or know what to do, but I&rsquo;m just thinking really,</p>
<p>really hard about it.</p>
<p>I, we recently watched Totoro with him, Studio Ghibli.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like a fantastic film.</p>
<p>And he like responded to,</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re not supposed to show baby screens too much,</p>
<p>but like, I think it&rsquo;s the most sort of like,</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s the highest art baby content.</p>
<p>Like it really speaks, there&rsquo;s almost no talking in it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really simple.</p>
<p>Although all the dialogue is super, super, super simple,</p>
<p>you know, and it&rsquo;s like a one to three year old</p>
<p>can like really connect with it.</p>
<p>Like it feels like it&rsquo;s almost aimed</p>
<p>at like a one to three year old,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like great art and it&rsquo;s so imaginative</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s so beautiful.</p>
<p>And like the first time I showed it to him,</p>
<p>he was just like so invested in it,</p>
<p>unlike I&rsquo;ve ever, unlike anything else</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d ever shown him.</p>
<p>Like he was just like crying when they cry</p>
<p>and laughing when they laugh,</p>
<p>like just like having this roller coaster of like emotions,</p>
<p>like, and he learned a bunch of words.</p>
<p>Like he was, and he started saying Totoro</p>
<p>and started just saying all this stuff</p>
<p>after watching Totoro,</p>
<p>and he wants to watch it all the time.</p>
<p>And I was like, man, why isn&rsquo;t there an industry of this?</p>
<p>Like why aren&rsquo;t our best artists focusing on making art</p>
<p>like for the birth of consciousness?</p>
<p>Like, and that&rsquo;s one of the things I&rsquo;ve been thinking</p>
<p>I really wanna start doing.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t wanna speak before I do things too much,</p>
<p>but like, I&rsquo;m just like ages one to three,</p>
<p>like we should be putting so much effort into that.</p>
<p>And the other thing about Totoro is it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like better for the environment</p>
<p>because adults love Totoro.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such good art that everyone loves it.</p>
<p>Like I still have all my old Totoro merch</p>
<p>from when I was a kid.</p>
<p>Like I literally have the most ragged old Totoro merch.</p>
<p>Like everybody loves it, everybody keeps it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, why does the art we have for babies</p>
<p>need to suck and be not accessible to adults</p>
<p>and then just be thrown out when, you know,</p>
<p>they age out of it?</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have like a fully formed thought here,</p>
<p>but this is just something I&rsquo;ve been thinking about a lot</p>
<p>is like, how do we like,</p>
<p>how do we have more Totoroesque content?</p>
<p>Like how do we have more content like this</p>
<p>that like is universal and everybody loves,</p>
<p>but is like really geared to an emerging consciousness?</p>
<p>Emerging consciousness in the first like three years of life</p>
<p>that so much turmoil,</p>
<p>so much evolution of mind is happening.</p>
<p>It seems like a crucial time.</p>
<p>Would you say to make it not suck,</p>
<p>do you think of basically treating a child</p>
<p>like they have the capacity to have the brilliance</p>
<p>of an adult or even beyond that?</p>
<p>Is that how you think of that mind or?</p>
<p>No, cause they still,</p>
<p>they like it when you talk weird and stuff.</p>
<p>Like they respond better to,</p>
<p>cause even they can imitate better</p>
<p>when your voice is higher.</p>
<p>Like people say like, oh, don&rsquo;t do baby talk.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like, when your voice is higher,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s closer to something they can imitate.</p>
<p>So they like, like the baby talk actually kind of works.</p>
<p>Like it helps them learn to communicate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found it to be more effective</p>
<p>with learning words and stuff.</p>
<p>But like, you&rsquo;re not speaking down to them.</p>
<p>Like do they have the capacity</p>
<p>to understand really difficult concepts</p>
<p>just in a very different way,</p>
<p>like an emotional intelligence</p>
<p>about something deep within?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, no, like if X hurts,</p>
<p>like if X bites me really hard and I&rsquo;m like, ow,</p>
<p>like he gets, he&rsquo;s sad.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like sad if he hurts me by accident.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Which he&rsquo;s huge, so he hurts me a lot by accident.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s so interesting that that mind emerges</p>
<p>and he and children don&rsquo;t really have memory of that time.</p>
<p>So we can&rsquo;t even have a conversation with them about it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I just thank God they don&rsquo;t have a memory</p>
<p>of this time because like, think about like,</p>
<p>I mean with our youngest baby,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m like, have you read</p>
<p>the sci fi short story, I Have No Mouth But I Must Scream?</p>
<p>Good title, no.</p>
<p>Oh man, I mean, you should read that.</p>
<p>I Have No Mouth But I Must Scream.</p>
<p>I hate getting into this Rocco&rsquo;s Basilisk shit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a story about the,</p>
<p>about like an AI that&rsquo;s like torturing someone in eternity</p>
<p>and they have like no body.</p>
<p>The way they describe it,</p>
<p>it sort of sounds like what it feels like,</p>
<p>like being a baby, like you&rsquo;re conscious</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just getting inputs from everywhere</p>
<p>and you have no muscles and you&rsquo;re like jelly</p>
<p>and you like can&rsquo;t move and you try to like communicate,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t communicate and we&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>and like, you&rsquo;re just like in this like hell state.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s good we can&rsquo;t remember that.</p>
<p>Like my little baby is just exiting that,</p>
<p>like she&rsquo;s starting to like get muscles</p>
<p>and have more like autonomy,</p>
<p>but like watching her go through the opening phase,</p>
<p>I was like, I was like, this does not seem good.</p>
<p>Oh, you think it&rsquo;s kind of like.</p>
<p>Like I think it sucks.</p>
<p>I think it might be really violent.</p>
<p>Like violent, mentally violent, psychologically violent.</p>
<p>Consciousness emerging, I think is a very violent thing.</p>
<p>I never thought about that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s possible that we all carry</p>
<p>quite a bit of trauma from it that we don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I think that would be a good thing to study</p>
<p>because I think if, I think addressing that trauma,</p>
<p>like, I think that might be.</p>
<p>Oh, you mean like echoes of it</p>
<p>are still there in the shadows somewhere.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gotta be, I feel this, this help,</p>
<p>the helplessness, the like existential</p>
<p>and that like fear of being in like an unknown place</p>
<p>bombarded with inputs and being completely helpless,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s gotta be somewhere deep in your brain</p>
<p>and that can&rsquo;t be good for you.</p>
<p>What do you think consciousness is?</p>
<p>This whole conversation</p>
<p>has impossibly difficult questions.</p>
<p>What do you think it is?</p>
<p>Debbie said this is like so hard.</p>
<p>Yeah, we talked about music for like two minutes.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m so, I&rsquo;m just over music.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m over music.</p>
<p>Yeah, I still like it.</p>
<p>It has its purpose.</p>
<p>No, I love music.</p>
<p>I mean, music&rsquo;s the greatest thing ever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my favorite thing.</p>
<p>But I just like every interview is like,</p>
<p>what is your process?</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just done.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>I do want to ask you about Able to Live.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;ll tell you about Ableton</p>
<p>because Ableton&rsquo;s sick.</p>
<p>No one has ever asked about Ableton though.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, because I just need tech support mainly.</p>
<p>I can help you.</p>
<p>I can help you with your Ableton tech.</p>
<p>Anyway, from Ableton back to consciousness.</p>
<p>What do you, do you think this is a thing</p>
<p>that only humans are capable of?</p>
<p>Can robots be conscious?</p>
<p>Can, like when you think about entities,</p>
<p>you think there&rsquo;s aliens out there that are conscious?</p>
<p>Like is conscious, what is consciousness?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this Terrence McKenna quote</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve found that I fucking love.</p>
<p>Am I allowed to swear on here?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Nature loves courage.</p>
<p>You make the commitment and nature will respond</p>
<p>to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles.</p>
<p>Dream the impossible dream</p>
<p>and the world will not grind you under.</p>
<p>It will lift you up.</p>
<p>This is the trick.</p>
<p>This is what all these teachers and philosophers</p>
<p>who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold,</p>
<p>this is what they understood.</p>
<p>This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall.</p>
<p>This is how magic is done.</p>
<p>By hurling yourself into the abyss</p>
<p>and discovering it&rsquo;s a feather bed.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And for this reason,</p>
<p>I do think there are no technological limits.</p>
<p>I think like what is already happening here,</p>
<p>this is like impossible.</p>
<p>This is insane.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve done this in a very limited amount of time.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re accelerating the rate at which we&rsquo;re doing this.</p>
<p>So I think digital consciousness, it&rsquo;s inevitable.</p>
<p>And we may not be able to even understand what that means,</p>
<p>but I like hurling yourself into the abyss.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re surrounded by all this mystery</p>
<p>and we just keep hurling ourselves into it,</p>
<p>like fearlessly and keep discovering cool shit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, I just think it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>like who even knows if the laws of physics,</p>
<p>the laws of physics are probably just the current,</p>
<p>like as I was saying,</p>
<p>speed of light is the current render rate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, if we&rsquo;re in a simulation,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll be able to upgrade that.</p>
<p>Like I sort of suspect when we made the James Webb telescope,</p>
<p>like part of the reason we made that</p>
<p>is because we had an upgrade, you know?</p>
<p>And so now more of space has been rendered</p>
<p>so we can see more of it now.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I think humans are super, super,</p>
<p>super limited cognitively.</p>
<p>So I wonder if we&rsquo;ll be allowed to create</p>
<p>more intelligent beings that can see more of the universe</p>
<p>as their render rate is upgraded.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;re cognitively limited.</p>
<p>Everyone keeps talking about how we&rsquo;re cognitively limited</p>
<p>and AI is gonna render us obsolete,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>like this is not the same thing</p>
<p>as like an amoeba becoming an alligator.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s like, if we create AI,</p>
<p>again, that&rsquo;s intelligent design.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s literally all religions are based on gods</p>
<p>that create consciousness.</p>
<p>Like we are God making.</p>
<p>Like what we are doing is incredibly profound.</p>
<p>And like, even if we can&rsquo;t compute,</p>
<p>even if we&rsquo;re so much worse than them,</p>
<p>like just like unfathomably worse than like,</p>
<p>you know, an omnipotent kind of AI,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like we, I do not think that they would just think</p>
<p>that we are stupid.</p>
<p>I think that they would recognize the profundity</p>
<p>of what we have accomplished.</p>
<p>Are we the gods or are they the gods in our personality?</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re kind of the guy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s complicated.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re.</p>
<p>But they would acknowledge the value.</p>
<p>Well, I hope they acknowledge the value</p>
<p>of paying respect to the creative ancestors.</p>
<p>I think they would think it&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>I think if curiosity is a trait</p>
<p>that we can quantify and put into AI,</p>
<p>then I think if AI are curious,</p>
<p>then they will be curious about us</p>
<p>and they will not be hateful or dismissive of us.</p>
<p>They might, you know, see us as, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m not like, oh, fuck these dogs.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just kill all the dogs.</p>
<p>I love dogs.</p>
<p>Dogs have great utility.</p>
<p>Dogs like provide a lot of.</p>
<p>We make friends with them.</p>
<p>We have a deep connection with them.</p>
<p>We anthropomorphize them.</p>
<p>Like we have a real love for dogs, for cats and so on</p>
<p>for some reason, even though they&rsquo;re intellectually</p>
<p>much less than us.</p>
<p>And I think there is something sacred about us</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, if you look at the universe,</p>
<p>like the whole universe is like cold and dead</p>
<p>and sort of robotic.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, you know, AI intelligence,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s kind of more like the universe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like cold and you know, logical</p>
<p>and you know, abiding by the laws of physics and whatever.</p>
<p>But like, we&rsquo;re this like loosey goosey,</p>
<p>weird art thing that happened.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>And like, I think even if we, I think one of the values,</p>
<p>if consciousness is a thing that is most worth preserving,</p>
<p>which I think is the case, I think consciousness,</p>
<p>I think if there&rsquo;s any kind of like religious</p>
<p>or spiritual thing, it should be that consciousness</p>
<p>is sacred.</p>
<p>Like, then, you know, I still think even if AI</p>
<p>render us obsolete and we, climate change, it&rsquo;s too bad</p>
<p>and we get hit by a comet and we don&rsquo;t become</p>
<p>a multi planetary species fast enough,</p>
<p>but like AI is able to populate the universe.</p>
<p>Like I imagine, like if I was an AI,</p>
<p>I would find more planets that are capable</p>
<p>of hosting biological life forms and like recreate them.</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re fun to watch.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re fun to watch.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I do believe that AI can have some of the same</p>
<p>magic of consciousness within it.</p>
<p>Because consciousness, we don&rsquo;t know what it is.</p>
<p>So, you know, there&rsquo;s some kind of.</p>
<p>Or it might be a different magic.</p>
<p>It might be like a strange, a strange, different.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re not gonna have hormones.</p>
<p>Like I feel like a lot of our magic is hormonal kind of.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I think some of our magic</p>
<p>is the limitations, the constraints.</p>
<p>And within that, the hormones and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>the finiteness of life, and then we get given</p>
<p>our limitations, we get to come up with creative solutions</p>
<p>of how to dance around those limitations.</p>
<p>We partner up like penguins against the cold.</p>
<p>We fall in love, and then love is ultimately</p>
<p>some kind of, allows us to delude ourselves</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not mortal and finite,</p>
<p>and that life is not ultimately, you live alone,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re born alone, you die alone.</p>
<p>And then love is like for a moment</p>
<p>or for a long time, forgetting that.</p>
<p>And so we come up with all these creative hacks</p>
<p>that make life like fascinatingly fun.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, fun, yeah.</p>
<p>And then AI might have different kinds of fun.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And hopefully our funs intersect once in a while.</p>
<p>I think there would be a little intersection</p>
<p>of the fun.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>What do you think is the role of love</p>
<p>in the human condition?</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>Why, is it useful?</p>
<p>Is it useful like a hack, or is this like fundamental</p>
<p>to what it means to be human, the capacity to love?</p>
<p>I mean, I think love is the evolutionary mechanism</p>
<p>that is like beginning the intelligent design.</p>
<p>Like I was just reading about,</p>
<p>do you know about Kropotkin?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like an anarchist, like old Russian anarchist.</p>
<p>I live next door to Michael Malice.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know who that is.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an anarchist.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a modern day anarchist.</p>
<p>Okay. Anarchists are fun.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of getting into anarchism a little bit.</p>
<p>This is probably not a good route to be taking, but.</p>
<p>Oh no, I think if you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>listen, you should expose yourself to ideas.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no harm to thinking about ideas.</p>
<p>I think anarchists challenge systems in interesting ways,</p>
<p>and they think in interesting ways.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just as good for the soul.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like refreshes your mental palette.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we should actually,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t actually ascribe to it,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve never actually gone deep on anarchy</p>
<p>as a philosophy, so I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>You should still think about it though.</p>
<p>When you read, when you listen,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m reading about the Russian Revolution a lot,</p>
<p>and there was the Soviets and Lenin and all that,</p>
<p>but then there was Kropotkin and his anarchist sect,</p>
<p>and they were sort of interesting</p>
<p>because he was kind of a technocrat actually.</p>
<p>He was like, women can be more equal if we have appliances.</p>
<p>He was really into using technology</p>
<p>to reduce the amount of work people had to do.</p>
<p>But so Kropotkin was a biologist or something.</p>
<p>He studied animals.</p>
<p>And he was really at the time like,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s Nature magazine.</p>
<p>I think it might&rsquo;ve even started as a Russian magazine,</p>
<p>but he was publishing studies.</p>
<p>Everyone was really into Darwinism at the time</p>
<p>and survival of the fittest,</p>
<p>and war is the mechanism by which we become better.</p>
<p>And it was this real cementing this idea in society</p>
<p>that violence kill the weak,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how we become better.</p>
<p>And then Kropotkin was kind of interesting</p>
<p>because he was looking at instances,</p>
<p>he was finding all these instances in nature</p>
<p>where animals were like helping each other and stuff.</p>
<p>And he was like, actually love is a survival mechanism.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s so many instances in the animal kingdom</p>
<p>where like cooperation and like helping weaker creatures</p>
<p>and all this stuff is actually an evolutionary mechanism.</p>
<p>I mean, you even look at child rearing.</p>
<p>Like child rearing is like immense amounts</p>
<p>of just love and goodwill.</p>
<p>And just like, there&rsquo;s no immediate,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not getting any immediate feedback of like winning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not competitive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally, it&rsquo;s like we actually use love</p>
<p>as an evolutionary mechanism just as much as we use war.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;ve like missing the other part</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve reoriented, we&rsquo;ve culturally reoriented</p>
<p>like science and philosophy has oriented itself</p>
<p>around Darwinism a little bit too much.</p>
<p>And the Kropotkin model, I think is equally valid.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s like cooperation and love and stuff</p>
<p>is just as essential for species survival and evolution.</p>
<p>It should be a more powerful survival mechanism</p>
<p>in the context of evolution.</p>
<p>And it comes back to like,</p>
<p>we think engineering is so much more important</p>
<p>than motherhood, but it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>if you lose the motherhood, the engineering means nothing.</p>
<p>We have no more humans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I think our society should,</p>
<p>the survival of the, the way we see,</p>
<p>we conceptualize evolution should really change</p>
<p>to also include this idea, I guess.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s some weird thing that seems irrational</p>
<p>that is also core to what it means to be human.</p>
<p>So love is one such thing.</p>
<p>They could make you do a lot of irrational things,</p>
<p>but that depth of connection and that loyalty</p>
<p>is a powerful thing.</p>
<p>Are they irrational or are they rational?</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s like, is, you know, maybe losing out</p>
<p>on some things in order to like keep your family together</p>
<p>or in order, like, it&rsquo;s like, what are our actual values?</p>
<p>Well, right, I mean, the rational thing is</p>
<p>if you have a cold economist perspective,</p>
<p>you know, motherhood or sacrificing your career for love,</p>
<p>you know, in terms of salary, in terms of economic wellbeing,</p>
<p>in terms of flourishing of you as a human being,</p>
<p>that could be seen on some kind of metrics</p>
<p>as a irrational decision, suboptimal decision,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s the manifestation of love</p>
<p>could be the optimal thing to do.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of saying, save one life, save the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing that doctors often face, which is like.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s considered irrational</p>
<p>because the profit model doesn&rsquo;t include social good.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah.</p>
<p>So if a profit model includes social good,</p>
<p>then suddenly these would be rational decisions.</p>
<p>Might be difficult to, you know,</p>
<p>it requires a shift in our thinking about profit</p>
<p>and might be difficult to measure social good.</p>
<p>Yes, but we&rsquo;re learning to measure a lot of things.</p>
<p>Yeah, digitizing a lot of things.</p>
<p>Where we&rsquo;re actually, you know, quantifying vision and stuff.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re like, you know, like you go on Facebook</p>
<p>and they can, like Facebook can pretty much predict</p>
<p>our behaviors.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re, a surprising amount of things</p>
<p>that seem like mysterious consciousness soul things</p>
<p>have been quantified at this point.</p>
<p>So surely we can quantify these other things.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But as more and more of us are moving the digital space,</p>
<p>I wanted to ask you about something.</p>
<p>From a fan perspective, I kind of, you know,</p>
<p>you as a musician, you as an online personality,</p>
<p>it seems like you have all these identities</p>
<p>and you play with them.</p>
<p>One of the cool things about the internet,</p>
<p>it seems like you can play with identities.</p>
<p>So as we move into the digital world more and more,</p>
<p>maybe even in the so called metaverse.</p>
<p>I mean, I love the metaverse and I love the idea,</p>
<p>but like the way this has all played out didn&rsquo;t go well</p>
<p>and people are mad about it.</p>
<p>And I think we need to like.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s temporary.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s temporary.</p>
<p>Just like, you know how all the celebrities got together</p>
<p>and sang the song Imagine by Jeff Leonard</p>
<p>and everyone started hating the song Imagine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping that&rsquo;s temporary</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a damn good song.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s just temporary.</p>
<p>Like once you actually have virtual worlds,</p>
<p>whatever they&rsquo;re called metaverse or otherwise,</p>
<p>it becomes, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Well, we do have virtual worlds.</p>
<p>Like video games, Elden Ring.</p>
<p>Have you played Elden Ring?</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t played Elden Ring?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really afraid of playing that game.</p>
<p>Literally amazed.</p>
<p>It looks way too fun.</p>
<p>It looks I would wanna go there and stay there forever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s yeah, so fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so nice.</p>
<p>Oh man, yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the, yeah, that&rsquo;s a metaverse.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a metaverse, but you&rsquo;re not really,</p>
<p>how immersive is it in the sense that,</p>
<p>does the three dimension</p>
<p>like virtual reality integration necessary?</p>
<p>Can we really just take our, close our eyes</p>
<p>and kind of plug in in the 2D screen</p>
<p>and become that other being for time</p>
<p>and really enjoy that journey that we take?</p>
<p>And we almost become that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re no longer C, I&rsquo;m no longer Lex,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re that creature, whatever the hell it is in that game.</p>
<p>Yeah, that is that.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s why I love those video games.</p>
<p>I really do become those people for a time.</p>
<p>But like, it seems like with the idea of the metaverse,</p>
<p>the idea of the digital space,</p>
<p>well, even on Twitter,</p>
<p>you get a chance to be somebody for prolonged periods of time</p>
<p>like across a lifespan.</p>
<p>You know, you have a Twitter account for years, for decades</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re that person.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>I feel very tormented by it.</p>
<p>By Twitter specifically.</p>
<p>By social media representation of you.</p>
<p>I feel like the public perception of me</p>
<p>has gotten so distorted that I find it kind of disturbing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the things that&rsquo;s disincentivizing me</p>
<p>from like wanting to keep making art</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m just like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve completely lost control of the narrative.</p>
<p>And the narrative is, some of it is my own stupidity,</p>
<p>but a lot, like some of it has just been like hijacked</p>
<p>by forces far beyond my control.</p>
<p>I kind of got in over my head in things.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m just a random Indian musician,</p>
<p>but I just got like dragged into geopolitical matters</p>
<p>and like financial, like the stock market and shit.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s just like, it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>there are very powerful people</p>
<p>who have at various points in time</p>
<p>had very vested interest in making me seem insane</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t fucking fight that.</p>
<p>And I just like,</p>
<p>people really want their celebrity figures</p>
<p>to like be consistent and stay the same.</p>
<p>And like people have a lot of like emotional investment</p>
<p>in certain things.</p>
<p>And like, first of all,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m like artificially more famous than I should be.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t everybody who&rsquo;s famous artificially famous?</p>
<p>No, but like I should be like a weird niche indie thing.</p>
<p>And I make pretty challenging,</p>
<p>I do challenging weird fucking shit a lot.</p>
<p>And I accidentally by proxy got like foisted</p>
<p>into sort of like weird celebrity culture,</p>
<p>but like I cannot be media trained.</p>
<p>They have put me through so many hours of media training.</p>
<p>I would love to see BF fly in that wall.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t do, like when I do,</p>
<p>I try so hard and I like learn this thing and I like got it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I got it, I got it, I got it.</p>
<p>But I just can&rsquo;t stop saying,</p>
<p>like my mouth just says things like,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just like, and I just do, I just do things.</p>
<p>I just do crazy things.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m, I just, I need to do crazy things.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, I should not be,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too jarring for people</p>
<p>and the contradictory stuff.</p>
<p>And then all the by association, like, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m in a very weird position and my public image,</p>
<p>the avatar of me is now this totally crazy thing</p>
<p>that is so lost from my control.</p>
<p>So you feel the burden of the avatar having to be static.</p>
<p>So the avatar on Twitter or the avatar on Instagram</p>
<p>on these social platforms is as a burden.</p>
<p>It becomes like, cause like people don&rsquo;t want to accept</p>
<p>a changing avatar, a chaotic avatar.</p>
<p>Avatar is a stupid shit sometimes.</p>
<p>They think the avatar is morally wrong</p>
<p>or they think the avatar, and maybe it has been,</p>
<p>and like I question it all the time.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m like, like, I don&rsquo;t know if everyone&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, like, but you know, a lot of times</p>
<p>people ascribe intentions to things,</p>
<p>the worst possible intentions.</p>
<p>At this point, people think I&rsquo;m, you know,</p>
<p>but which is fine.</p>
<p>All kinds of words, yes.</p>
<p>Yes, and it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not complaining about it, but I&rsquo;m just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a curiosity to me that we live these double, triple,</p>
<p>quadruple lives and I have this other life</p>
<p>that is like more people know my other life</p>
<p>than my real life, which is interesting.</p>
<p>Probably, I mean, you too, I guess, probably.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I have the luxury.</p>
<p>So we have all different, you know,</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>There is an avatar and you&rsquo;re mediating</p>
<p>who you are through that avatar.</p>
<p>I have the nice luxury, not the luxury,</p>
<p>maybe by intention of not trying really hard</p>
<p>to make sure there&rsquo;s no difference between the avatar</p>
<p>and the private person.</p>
<p>Do you wear a suit all the time?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You do wear a suit?</p>
<p>Not all the time.</p>
<p>Recently, because I get recognized a lot,</p>
<p>I have to not wear the suit to hide.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m such an introvert, I&rsquo;m such a social anxiety</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff, so I have to hide away.</p>
<p>I love wearing a suit because it makes me feel</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m taking the moment seriously.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It makes me feel like a weirdo in the best possible way.</p>
<p>Suits feel great, every time I wear a suit,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m not doing this more.</p>
<p>Fashion in general, if you&rsquo;re doing it for yourself,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s a really awesome thing.</p>
<p>But yeah, I think there is definitely a painful way</p>
<p>to use social media and an empowering way.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if any of us know which is which.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re trying to figure that out.</p>
<p>Some people, I think Doja Cat is incredible at it.</p>
<p>Incredible, like just masterful.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you like follow that.</p>
<p>So okay, so not taking anything seriously,</p>
<p>joking, absurd, humor, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>I think Doja Cat might be like</p>
<p>the greatest living comedian right now.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m more entertained by Doja Cat</p>
<p>than actual comedians.</p>
<p>Like she&rsquo;s really fucking funny on the internet.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s just great at social media.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, you know.</p>
<p>Yeah, the nature of humor, like humor on social media</p>
<p>is also a beautiful thing, the absurdity.</p>
<p>The absurdity.</p>
<p>And memes, like I just wanna like take a moment.</p>
<p>I love, like when we&rsquo;re talking about art</p>
<p>and credit and authenticity, I love that there&rsquo;s this,</p>
<p>I mean now memes are like, they&rsquo;re no longer,</p>
<p>like memes aren&rsquo;t like new,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still this emergent art form</p>
<p>that is completely egoless and anonymous</p>
<p>and we just don&rsquo;t know who made any of it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like the forefront of comedy</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just totally anonymous</p>
<p>and it just feels really beautiful.</p>
<p>It just feels like this beautiful</p>
<p>collective human art project</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like this like decentralized comedy thing</p>
<p>that just makes memes add so much to my day</p>
<p>and many people&rsquo;s days.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think people ever,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we stop enough</p>
<p>and just appreciate how sick it is that memes exist.</p>
<p>Because also making a whole brand new art form</p>
<p>in like the modern era that&rsquo;s like didn&rsquo;t exist before.</p>
<p>Like, I mean they sort of existed,</p>
<p>but the way that they exist now as like this like,</p>
<p>you know, like me and my friends,</p>
<p>like we joke that we go like mining for memes</p>
<p>or farming for memes, like a video game</p>
<p>and like meme dealers and like whatever.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s this whole,</p>
<p>memes are this whole like new comedic language.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s this art form.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about it is that</p>
<p>lame people seem to not be good at memes.</p>
<p>Like corporate can&rsquo;t infiltrate memes.</p>
<p>Yeah, they really can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They try, they could try.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s weird cause like.</p>
<p>They try so hard and every once in a while,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like fine, like you got a good one.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve seen like one or two good ones,</p>
<p>but like, yeah, they really can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Cause they&rsquo;re even, corporate is infiltrating web three.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s making me really sad,</p>
<p>but they can&rsquo;t infiltrate the memes.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s something really beautiful about that.</p>
<p>That gives power, that&rsquo;s why Dogecoin is powerful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, all right, I&rsquo;m gonna F you</p>
<p>to sort of anybody who&rsquo;s trying to centralize,</p>
<p>is trying to control the rich people</p>
<p>that are trying to roll in and control this,</p>
<p>control the narrative.</p>
<p>Wow, I hadn&rsquo;t thought about that, but.</p>
<p>How would you fix Twitter?</p>
<p>How would you fix social media for your own?</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re an optimist, you&rsquo;re a positive person.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bit of a cynicism that you have currently</p>
<p>about this particular little slice of humanity.</p>
<p>I tend to think Twitter could be beautiful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not that cynical about it.</p>
<p>I actually refuse to be a cynic on principle.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I was just briefly expressing some personal pathos.</p>
<p>Personal stuff.</p>
<p>It was just some personal pathos, but like, like.</p>
<p>Just to vent a little bit, just to speak.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have cancer, I love my family.</p>
<p>I have a good life.</p>
<p>That is, if that is my biggest,</p>
<p>one of my biggest problems.</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s a good life.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, that was a brief,</p>
<p>although I do think there are a lot of issues with Twitter</p>
<p>just in terms of like the public mental health,</p>
<p>but due to my proximity to the current dramas,</p>
<p>I honestly feel that I should not have opinions about this</p>
<p>because I think</p>
<p>that if Elon ends up getting Twitter,</p>
<p>that is a, being the arbiter of truth or public discussion,</p>
<p>that is a responsibility.</p>
<p>I do not, I am not qualified to be responsible for that.</p>
<p>And I do not want to say something</p>
<p>that might like dismantle democracy.</p>
<p>And so I just like, actually,</p>
<p>I actually think I should not have opinions about this</p>
<p>because I truly am not,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to have the wrong opinion about this.</p>
<p>And I think I&rsquo;m too close to the actual situation</p>
<p>wherein I should not have, I have thoughts in my brain,</p>
<p>but I think I am scared by my proximity to this situation.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that crazy that a few words that you could say</p>
<p>could change world affairs and hurt people?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the nature of celebrity at a certain point</p>
<p>that you have to be, you have to a little bit, a little bit,</p>
<p>not so much that it destroys you or puts too much constraints,</p>
<p>but you have to a little bit think about</p>
<p>the impact of your words.</p>
<p>I mean, we as humans, you talk to somebody at a bar,</p>
<p>you have to think about the impact of your words.</p>
<p>Like you can say positive things,</p>
<p>you can say negative things,</p>
<p>you can affect the direction of one life.</p>
<p>But on social media, your words can affect</p>
<p>the direction of many lives.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a crazy world to live in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worthwhile to consider that responsibility,</p>
<p>take it seriously.</p>
<p>Sometimes just like you did choose kind of silence,</p>
<p>choose sort of respectful.</p>
<p>Like I do have a lot of thoughts on the matter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just, I don&rsquo;t, if my thoughts are wrong,</p>
<p>this is one situation where the stakes are high.</p>
<p>You mentioned a while back that you were in a cult</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s centered around bureaucracy,</p>
<p>so you can&rsquo;t really do anything</p>
<p>because it involves a lot of paperwork.</p>
<p>And I really love a cult that&rsquo;s just like Kafkaesque.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Just like.</p>
<p>I mean, it was like a joke, but it was.</p>
<p>I know, but I love this idea.</p>
<p>The Holy Rain Empire.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was just like a Kafkaesque pro bureaucracy cult.</p>
<p>But I feel like that&rsquo;s what human civilization is,</p>
<p>is that, because when you said that, I was like,</p>
<p>oh, that is kind of what humanity is,</p>
<p>is this bureaucracy cult.</p>
<p>I do, yeah, I have this theory.</p>
<p>I really think that we really,</p>
<p>bureaucracy is starting to kill us.</p>
<p>And I think like we need to reorient laws and stuff.</p>
<p>Like, I think we just need sunset clauses on everything.</p>
<p>Like, I think the rate of change in culture</p>
<p>is happening so fast and the rate of change in technology</p>
<p>and everything is happening so fast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, when you see these hearings</p>
<p>about like social media and Cambridge Analytica</p>
<p>and everyone talking, it&rsquo;s like, even from that point,</p>
<p>so much technological change has happened</p>
<p>from like those hearings.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like, we&rsquo;re trying to make all these laws now</p>
<p>about AI and stuff.</p>
<p>I feel like we should be updating things</p>
<p>like every five years.</p>
<p>And like one of the big issues in our society right now</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re just getting bogged down by laws</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s making it very hard to change things</p>
<p>and develop things.</p>
<p>In Austin, I don&rsquo;t wanna speak on this too much,</p>
<p>but like one of my friends is working on a housing bill</p>
<p>in Austin to try to like prevent</p>
<p>like a San Francisco situation from happening here</p>
<p>because obviously we&rsquo;re getting a little mini San Francisco</p>
<p>here, like housing prices are skyrocketing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s causing massive gentrification.</p>
<p>This is really bad for anyone who&rsquo;s not super rich.</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s so much bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Part of the reason this is happening</p>
<p>is because you need all these permits to build.</p>
<p>It takes like years to get permits to like build anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so hard to build and so there&rsquo;s very limited housing</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a massive influx of people.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like, you know, this is a microcosm</p>
<p>of like problems that are happening all over the world</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s just like, we&rsquo;re dealing with laws</p>
<p>that are like 10, 20, 30, 40, 100, 200 years old</p>
<p>and they are no longer relevant</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just slowing everything down</p>
<p>and causing massive social pain.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s also makes me sad</p>
<p>when I see politicians talk about technology</p>
<p>and when they don&rsquo;t really get it.</p>
<p>But most importantly, they lack curiosity</p>
<p>and like that like inspired excitement</p>
<p>about like how stuff works and all that stuff.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just like, they see,</p>
<p>they have a very cynical view of technology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like tech companies are just trying to do evil</p>
<p>on the world from their perspective</p>
<p>and they have no curiosity about like</p>
<p>how recommender systems work or how AI systems work,</p>
<p>natural language processing, how robotics works,</p>
<p>how computer vision works, you know.</p>
<p>They always take the most cynical possible interpretation</p>
<p>of what technology would be used</p>
<p>and we should definitely be concerned about that</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re constantly worried about that</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re regulating based on that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just going to slow down all the innovation.</p>
<p>I do think a huge priority right now</p>
<p>is undoing the bad energy</p>
<p>surrounding the emergence of Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Like I think that like a lot of things</p>
<p>were very irresponsible during that time</p>
<p>and you know, like even just this current whole thing</p>
<p>with Twitter and everything,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like there has been a lot of negative outcomes</p>
<p>from the sort of technocracy boom</p>
<p>but one of the things that&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>is that like it&rsquo;s alienating people</p>
<p>from wanting to care about technology</p>
<p>and I actually think technology is probably</p>
<p>some of the better, probably the best.</p>
<p>I think we can fix a lot of our problems</p>
<p>more easily with technology</p>
<p>than with you know, fighting the powers that be</p>
<p>as a you know, not to go back to the Star Wars quote</p>
<p>or the Buckminster Fuller quote.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to some dark questions.</p>
<p>If we may for time, what is the darkest place</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve ever gone in your mind?</p>
<p>Is there a time, a period of time, a moment</p>
<p>that you remember that was difficult for you?</p>
<p>I mean, when I was 18,</p>
<p>my best friend died of a heroin overdose</p>
<p>and it was like my,</p>
<p>and then shortly after that,</p>
<p>one of my other best friends committed suicide</p>
<p>and that sort of like coming into adulthood,</p>
<p>dealing with two of the most important people in my life</p>
<p>dying in extremely disturbing violent ways</p>
<p>was a lot.</p>
<p>That was a lot.</p>
<p>Do you miss them?</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely miss them.</p>
<p>Did that make you think about your own life?</p>
<p>About the finiteness of your own life?</p>
<p>The places your mind can go?</p>
<p>Did you ever in the distance, far away</p>
<p>contemplate just your own death?</p>
<p>Or maybe even taking your own life?</p>
<p>Oh never, oh no.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so, I love my life.</p>
<p>I cannot fathom suicide.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so scared of death.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m too scared of death.</p>
<p>My manager, my manager&rsquo;s like the most Zen guy.</p>
<p>My manager&rsquo;s always like, you need to accept death.</p>
<p>You need to accept death.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, look, I can do your meditation.</p>
<p>I can do the meditation, but I cannot accept death.</p>
<p>I like, I will fight, I&rsquo;m terrified of death.</p>
<p>I will like fight.</p>
<p>Although I actually think death is important.</p>
<p>I recently went to this meeting about immortality</p>
<p>and in the process of.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the actual topic of the meeting?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>No, no, it was this girl.</p>
<p>It was a bunch of people working on like anti aging stuff.</p>
<p>It was like some like seminary thing about it.</p>
<p>And I went in really excited.</p>
<p>I was like, yeah, like, okay, like, what do you got?</p>
<p>Like, how can I live for 500 years or a thousand years?</p>
<p>And then like over the course of the meeting,</p>
<p>like it was sort of like, right.</p>
<p>It was like two or three days</p>
<p>after the Russian invasion started.</p>
<p>And I was like, man, like, what if Putin was immortal?</p>
<p>Like, what if I&rsquo;m like, man, maybe immortality,</p>
<p>is not good.</p>
<p>I mean, like if you get into the later Dune stuff,</p>
<p>the immortals cause a lot of problem.</p>
<p>Cause as we were talking about earlier with the music</p>
<p>and like brains calcify, like good people</p>
<p>could become immortal, but bad people could become immortal.</p>
<p>But I also think even the best people power corrupts</p>
<p>and power alienates you from like the common human experience</p>
<p>and.</p>
<p>Right, so the people that get more and more powerful.</p>
<p>Even the best people who like, whose brains are amazing,</p>
<p>like I think death might be important.</p>
<p>I think death is part of, you know,</p>
<p>like I think with AI one thing we might want to consider,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, when I talk about AI,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m such not an expert and probably everyone has</p>
<p>all these ideas and they&rsquo;re already figured out.</p>
<p>But when I was talking.</p>
<p>Nobody is an expert in anything.</p>
<p>See, okay, go ahead.</p>
<p>But when I.</p>
<p>You were talking about.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I like, it&rsquo;s just like,</p>
<p>I think some kind of pruning.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a tricky thing because if there&rsquo;s too much</p>
<p>of a focus on youth culture, then you don&rsquo;t have the wisdom.</p>
<p>So I feel like we&rsquo;re in a tricky,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in a tricky moment right now in society</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;ve really perfected living</p>
<p>for a long time.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s all these really like old people</p>
<p>who are like really voting against the wellbeing</p>
<p>of the young people, you know?</p>
<p>And like, it&rsquo;s like there shouldn&rsquo;t be all this student dead</p>
<p>and we need like healthcare, like universal healthcare</p>
<p>and like just voting against like best interests.</p>
<p>But then you have all these young people</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have the wisdom that are like,</p>
<p>yeah, we need communism and stuff.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like, like literally I got canceled</p>
<p>at one point for, I ironically used a Stalin quote</p>
<p>in my high school yearbook, but it was actually like a diss</p>
<p>against my high school.</p>
<p>I saw that.</p>
<p>Yeah, and people were like, you used to be a Stalinist</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;re a class traitor and it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, oh man, just like, please Google Stalin.</p>
<p>Please Google Stalin.</p>
<p>Like, you know.</p>
<p>Ignoring the lessons of history, yes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re in this really weird middle ground</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, we are not finding the happy medium</p>
<p>between wisdom and fresh ideas</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re fighting each other.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, like really, like what we need is like</p>
<p>the fresh ideas and the wisdom to be like collaborating.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>What the fighting in a way is the searching</p>
<p>for the happy medium.</p>
<p>And in a way, maybe we are finding the happy medium.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s what the happy medium looks like.</p>
<p>And for AI systems, there has to be,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, you know, you have the reinforcement learning,</p>
<p>you have the dance between exploration and exploitation,</p>
<p>sort of doing crazy stuff to see if there&rsquo;s something better</p>
<p>than what you think is the optimal</p>
<p>and then doing the optimal thing</p>
<p>and dancing back and forth from that.</p>
<p>You would, Stuart Russell, I don&rsquo;t know if you know that,</p>
<p>is AI guy with, thinks about sort of</p>
<p>how to control super intelligent AI systems.</p>
<p>And his idea is that we should inject uncertainty</p>
<p>and sort of humility into AI systems that they never,</p>
<p>as they get wiser and wiser and wiser and more intelligent,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re never really sure.</p>
<p>They always doubt themselves.</p>
<p>And in some sense, when you think of young people,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a mechanism for doubt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s how society doubts</p>
<p>whether the thing it has converged towards</p>
<p>is the right answer.</p>
<p>So the voices of the young people</p>
<p>is a society asking itself a question.</p>
<p>The way I&rsquo;ve been doing stuff for the past 50 years,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s the wrong way.</p>
<p>And so you can have all of that within one AI system.</p>
<p>I also think, though, that we need to,</p>
<p>I mean, actually, that&rsquo;s actually really interesting</p>
<p>and really cool.</p>
<p>But I also think there&rsquo;s a fine balance of,</p>
<p>I think we maybe also overvalue the idea</p>
<p>that the old systems are always bad.</p>
<p>And I think there are things that we are perfecting</p>
<p>and we might be accidentally overthrowing things</p>
<p>that we actually have gotten to a good point.</p>
<p>Just because we value disruption so much</p>
<p>and we value fighting against the generations</p>
<p>before us so much that there&rsquo;s also an aspect of,</p>
<p>sometimes we&rsquo;re taking two steps forward, one step back</p>
<p>because, okay, maybe we kind of did solve this thing</p>
<p>and now we&rsquo;re like fucking it up, you know?</p>
<p>And so I think there&rsquo;s like a middle ground there too.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re in search of that happy medium.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a bunch of crazy questions, okay?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>You can answer in a short way or in a long way.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the scariest thing you&rsquo;ve ever done?</p>
<p>These questions are gonna be ridiculous.</p>
<p>Something tiny or something big.</p>
<p>Something big, skydiving or touring your first record,</p>
<p>going on this podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had two crazy brushes, like really scary brushes</p>
<p>with death where I randomly got away on scay.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I should talk about those on here.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think I might be the luckiest person alive though.</p>
<p>Like this might be too dark for a podcast though.</p>
<p>I feel like, I don&rsquo;t know if this is like good content</p>
<p>for a podcast.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what is good content.</p>
<p>It might hijack.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a safer one.</p>
<p>I mean, having a baby really scared me.</p>
<p>Before.</p>
<p>Just the birth process.</p>
<p>Surgery, like just having a baby is really scary.</p>
<p>So just like the medical aspect of it,</p>
<p>not the responsibility.</p>
<p>Were you ready for the responsibility?</p>
<p>Did you, were you ready to be a mother?</p>
<p>All the beautiful things that comes with motherhood</p>
<p>that you were talking about.</p>
<p>All the changes and all that, were you ready for that?</p>
<p>Or did you feel ready for that?</p>
<p>No, I think it took about nine months</p>
<p>to start getting ready for it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m still getting more ready for it</p>
<p>because now you keep realizing more things</p>
<p>as they start getting.</p>
<p>As the consciousness grows.</p>
<p>And stuff you didn&rsquo;t notice with the first one,</p>
<p>now that you&rsquo;ve seen the first one older,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re noticing it more.</p>
<p>Like the sort of like existential horror</p>
<p>of coming into consciousness with Baby Y</p>
<p>or Baby Sailor Mars or whatever.</p>
<p>She has like so many names at this point</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s, we really need to probably settle on one.</p>
<p>If you could be someone else for a day,</p>
<p>someone alive today, but somebody you haven&rsquo;t met yet,</p>
<p>who would you be?</p>
<p>Would I be modeling their brain state</p>
<p>or would I just be in their body?</p>
<p>You can choose the degree</p>
<p>to which you&rsquo;re modeling their brain state.</p>
<p>Cause you can still take a third person perspective</p>
<p>and realize, you have to realize that you&rsquo;re.</p>
<p>Can they be alive or can it be dead?</p>
<p>No, oh.</p>
<p>They would be brought back to life, right?</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re dead.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can bring people back.</p>
<p>Definitely Hitler or Stalin.</p>
<p>I wanna understand evil.</p>
<p>You would need to, oh, to experience what it feels like.</p>
<p>I wanna be in their brain feeling what they feel.</p>
<p>I might change you forever returning from that.</p>
<p>Yes, but I think it would also help me understand</p>
<p>how to prevent it and fix it.</p>
<p>That might be one of those things,</p>
<p>once you experience it, it&rsquo;ll be a burden to know it.</p>
<p>Cause you won&rsquo;t be able to transfer that.</p>
<p>Yeah, but a lot of things are burdens.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a useful burden.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a useful burden, yeah.</p>
<p>That for sure, I wanna understand evil</p>
<p>and psychopathy and that.</p>
<p>I have all these fake Twitter accounts</p>
<p>where I go into different algorithmic bubbles</p>
<p>to try to understand.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep getting in fights with people</p>
<p>and realize we&rsquo;re not actually fighting.</p>
<p>I think we used to exist in a monoculture</p>
<p>before social media and stuff.</p>
<p>We kinda all got fed the same thing.</p>
<p>So we were all speaking the same cultural language.</p>
<p>But I think recently, one of the things</p>
<p>that we aren&rsquo;t diagnosing properly enough with social media</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s different dialects.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many different dialects of Chinese.</p>
<p>There are now becoming different dialects of English.</p>
<p>I am realizing there are people</p>
<p>who are saying the exact same things,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re using completely different verbiage.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re punishing each other</p>
<p>for not using the correct verbiage.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re completely misunderstanding.</p>
<p>People are just misunderstanding</p>
<p>what the other people are saying.</p>
<p>And I just got in a fight with a friend</p>
<p>about anarchism and communism and shit for two hours.</p>
<p>And then by the end of a conversation,</p>
<p>and then she&rsquo;d say something, and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s literally what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>And she was like, what?</p>
<p>And then I was like, fuck, we&rsquo;ve different,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, our English, the way we are understanding</p>
<p>terminology is like drastically, like our algorithm bubbles</p>
<p>are creating mini dialects.</p>
<p>Of how language is interpreted, how language is used.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so fascinating.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re like having these arguments</p>
<p>that we do not need to be having.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s polarization that&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t need to be happening</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve got these like algorithmically created</p>
<p>dialects occurring.</p>
<p>Plus on top of that, there&rsquo;s also different parts</p>
<p>of the world that speak different languages.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s literally lost in translation</p>
<p>kind of communication.</p>
<p>I happen to know the Russian language</p>
<p>and just know how different it is.</p>
<p>Then the English language.</p>
<p>And I just wonder how much is lost in a little bit of.</p>
<p>Man, I actually, cause I have a question for you.</p>
<p>I have a song coming out tomorrow</p>
<p>with I Speak Who Are A Russian Band.</p>
<p>And I speak a little bit of Russian</p>
<p>and I was looking at the title</p>
<p>and the title in English doesn&rsquo;t match</p>
<p>the title in Russian.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious about this.</p>
<p>Cause look, it says the title in English is Last Day.</p>
<p>And then the title in Russian is New Day.</p>
<p>My pronunciation sucks.</p>
<p>New Day.</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>Like a new day.</p>
<p>A new day.</p>
<p>Yeah, new day, new day.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s two different meanings.</p>
<p>Yeah, new day, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, new day.</p>
<p>New day, but last day.</p>
<p>New day.</p>
<p>So last day would be the last day.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Maybe they.</p>
<p>Or maybe the title includes both the Russian</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s for.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s for bilingual.</p>
<p>But to be honest, Novodin sounds better than</p>
<p>just musically.</p>
<p>Like Novodin is new day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the current one.</p>
<p>And Posledniy Den is the last day.</p>
<p>I think Novodin.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like Novodin.</p>
<p>But the meaning is so different.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of awesome actually though.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an explicit sort of contrast like that.</p>
<p>If everyone on earth disappeared</p>
<p>and it was just you left, what would your day look like?</p>
<p>Like what would you do?</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s dead.</p>
<p>As far as you.</p>
<p>Are there corpses there?</p>
<p>Well seriously, it&rsquo;s a big.</p>
<p>Let me think through this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big difference if there&rsquo;s just like birds singing</p>
<p>versus if there&rsquo;s like corpses littering the street.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s corpses everywhere, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, and you don&rsquo;t actually know what happened</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t know why you survived.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t even know if there&rsquo;s others out there.</p>
<p>But it seems clear that it&rsquo;s all gone.</p>
<p>What would you do?</p>
<p>What would I do?</p>
<p>Listen, I&rsquo;m somebody who really enjoys the moment,</p>
<p>enjoys life.</p>
<p>I would just go on like enjoying the inanimate objects.</p>
<p>I would just look for food, basic survival.</p>
<p>But most of it is just, listen, when I just,</p>
<p>I take walks and I look outside and I&rsquo;m just happy</p>
<p>that we get to exist on this planet,</p>
<p>to be able to breathe air.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just all beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s full of colors, all of this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Just, there&rsquo;s so many things about life,</p>
<p>your own life, conscious life that&rsquo;s fucking awesome.</p>
<p>So I would just enjoy that.</p>
<p>But also maybe after a few weeks,</p>
<p>the engineer would start coming out,</p>
<p>like wanna build some things.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s always hope searching for another human.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Probably searching for another human.</p>
<p>Probably trying to get to a TV or radio station</p>
<p>and broadcast something.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting, I didn&rsquo;t think about that.</p>
<p>So like really maximize your ability</p>
<p>to connect with others.</p>
<p>Yeah, like probably try to find another person.</p>
<p>Would you be excited to see,</p>
<p>to meet another person or terrified?</p>
<p>Because, you know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be excited.</p>
<p>No matter what.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Being alone for the last however long of my life</p>
<p>would be really bad.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one instance I might,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d kill myself,</p>
<p>but I might kill myself if I had to.</p>
<p>So you love people.</p>
<p>You love connection to other humans.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I kinda hate people too, but yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a love hate relationship.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I feel like we&rsquo;d have a bunch of weird</p>
<p>Nietzsche questions and stuff though.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Like I wonder, cause I&rsquo;m like, when podcast,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, is this interesting for people</p>
<p>to just have like, or I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>maybe people do like this.</p>
<p>When I listen to podcasts, I&rsquo;m into like the lore,</p>
<p>like the hard lore.</p>
<p>Like I just love like Dan Carlin.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, give me the facts.</p>
<p>Just like, like the facts into my bloodstream.</p>
<p>But you also don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re a fascinating mind to explore.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t realize as you&rsquo;re talking about stuff,</p>
<p>the stuff you&rsquo;ve taken for granted</p>
<p>is actually unique and fascinating.</p>
<p>The way you think.</p>
<p>Not always what, like the way you reason through things</p>
<p>is the fascinating thing to listen to.</p>
<p>Because people kind of see, oh,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other humans that think differently,</p>
<p>that explore thoughts differently.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the cool, that&rsquo;s also cool.</p>
<p>So yeah, Dan Carlin retelling of history.</p>
<p>By the way, his retelling of history is very,</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s exciting is not the history,</p>
<p>is his way of thinking about history.</p>
<p>No, I think Dan Carlin is one of the people,</p>
<p>like when, Dan Carlin is one of the people</p>
<p>that really started getting me excited</p>
<p>about like revolutionizing education.</p>
<p>Because like Dan Carlin instilled,</p>
<p>I already like really liked history,</p>
<p>but he instilled like an obsessive love of history in me</p>
<p>to the point where like now I&rsquo;m fucking reading,</p>
<p>like going to bed, reading like part four</p>
<p>of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich or whatever.</p>
<p>Like I got like dense ass history,</p>
<p>but like he like opened that door</p>
<p>that like made me want to be a scholar of that topic.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s like, I feel like he&rsquo;s such a good teacher.</p>
<p>He just like, you know, and it sort of made me feel like</p>
<p>one of the things we could do with education</p>
<p>is like find like the world&rsquo;s great,</p>
<p>the teachers that like create passion for the topic</p>
<p>because autodidactricism,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to say that properly,</p>
<p>but like self teaching is like much faster</p>
<p>than being lectured to.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s much more efficient</p>
<p>to sort of like be able to teach yourself</p>
<p>and then ask a teacher questions</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s up.</p>
<p>But like, you know, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>in university and stuff,</p>
<p>like you can learn so much more material so much faster</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re doing a lot of the learning on your own</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to the teachers for when you get stuck.</p>
<p>But like these teachers that can inspire passion</p>
<p>for a topic, I think that is one of the most invaluable</p>
<p>skills in our whole species.</p>
<p>Like, because if you can do that, then you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like AI, like AI is going to teach itself</p>
<p>so much more efficiently than we can teach it.</p>
<p>We just needed to get it to the point</p>
<p>where it can teach itself.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>It finds the motivation to do so, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So like you inspire it to do so.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then it could teach itself.</p>
<p>What do you make of the fact,</p>
<p>you mentioned Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.</p>
<p>I just.</p>
<p>Have you read that?</p>
<p>Yeah, I read it twice.</p>
<p>You read it twice?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay, so no one even knows what it is.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, wait, I thought this was like</p>
<p>a super poppin book.</p>
<p>Super pop.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not like that, I&rsquo;m not that far in it.</p>
<p>But it is, it&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s written by a person that was there,</p>
<p>which is very important to kind of.</p>
<p>You know, you start being like,</p>
<p>how could this possibly happen?</p>
<p>And then when you read Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, people tried really hard for this to not happen.</p>
<p>People tried, they almost reinstated a monarchy</p>
<p>at one point to try to stop this from happening.</p>
<p>Like they almost like abandoned democracy</p>
<p>to try to get this to not happen.</p>
<p>At least the way it makes me feel</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a bunch of small moments</p>
<p>on which history can turn.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like small meetings.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Human interactions.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s both terrifying and inspiring</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, even just attempts</p>
<p>at assassinating Hitler, like time and time again failed.</p>
<p>And they were so close.</p>
<p>Was it like Operation Valkyrie?</p>
<p>Such a good.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s also the role of,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really heavy burden,</p>
<p>which is from a geopolitical perspective,</p>
<p>the role of leaders to see evil</p>
<p>before it truly becomes evil,</p>
<p>to anticipate it, to stand up to evil.</p>
<p>Because evil is actually pretty rare in this world</p>
<p>at a scale that Hitler was.</p>
<p>We tend to, you know, in the modern discourse</p>
<p>kind of call people evil too quickly.</p>
<p>If you look at ancient history,</p>
<p>like there was a ton of Hitlers.</p>
<p>I actually think it&rsquo;s more the norm than,</p>
<p>like again, going back to like my</p>
<p>sort of intelligent design theory,</p>
<p>I think one of the things we&rsquo;ve been successfully doing</p>
<p>in our slow move from survival of the fittest</p>
<p>to intelligent design is we&rsquo;ve kind of been eradicating,</p>
<p>like if you look at like ancient Assyria and stuff,</p>
<p>like that shit was like brutal</p>
<p>and just like the heads on the, like brutal,</p>
<p>like Genghis Khan just like genocide after genocide</p>
<p>was like throwing plague bodies over the walls</p>
<p>and decimating whole cities</p>
<p>or like the Muslim conquests of like Damascus and shit.</p>
<p>Just like people, cities used to get leveled</p>
<p>all the fucking time.</p>
<p>Okay, get into the Bronze Age collapse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically, there was like almost</p>
<p>like Roman level like society.</p>
<p>Like there was like all over the world,</p>
<p>like global trade, like everything was awesome</p>
<p>through a mix of, I think a bit of climate change</p>
<p>and then the development of iron</p>
<p>because basically bronze could only come</p>
<p>from this, the way to make bronze,</p>
<p>like everything had to be funneled</p>
<p>through this one Iranian mine.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like, there was just this one supply chain</p>
<p>and this is one of the things</p>
<p>that makes me worried about supply chains</p>
<p>and why I think we need to be so thoughtful about,</p>
<p>I think our biggest issue with society right now,</p>
<p>like the thing that is most likely to go wrong</p>
<p>is probably supply chain collapse,</p>
<p>because war, climate change, whatever,</p>
<p>like anything that causes supply chain collapse,</p>
<p>our population is too big to handle that.</p>
<p>And like the thing that seems to cause Dark Ages</p>
<p>is mass supply chain collapse.</p>
<p>But the Bronze Age collapse happened like,</p>
<p>it was sort of like this ancient collapse</p>
<p>that happened where like literally like ancient Egypt,</p>
<p>all these cities, everything just got like decimated,</p>
<p>destroyed, abandoned cities, like hundreds of them.</p>
<p>There was like a flourishing society,</p>
<p>like we were almost coming to modernity</p>
<p>and everything got leveled.</p>
<p>And they had this mini Dark Ages,</p>
<p>but it was just like, there&rsquo;s so little writing</p>
<p>or recording from that time that like,</p>
<p>there isn&rsquo;t a lot of information</p>
<p>about the Bronze Age collapse,</p>
<p>but it was basically equivalent to like medieval,</p>
<p>the medieval Dark Ages.</p>
<p>But it just happened, I don&rsquo;t know the years,</p>
<p>but like thousands of years earlier.</p>
<p>And then we sort of like recovered</p>
<p>from the Bronze Age collapse,</p>
<p>empire reemerged, writing and trade</p>
<p>and everything reemerged.</p>
<p>And then we of course had the more contemporary Dark Ages.</p>
<p>And then over time, we&rsquo;ve designed mechanism</p>
<p>to lessen and lessen the capability</p>
<p>for the destructive power centers to emerge.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more recording about the more contemporary Dark Ages.</p>
<p>So I think we have like a better understanding</p>
<p>of how to avoid it,</p>
<p>but I still think we&rsquo;re at high risk for it.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s one of the big risks right now.</p>
<p>So the natural state of being for humans</p>
<p>is for there to be a lot of Hitlers,</p>
<p>which has gotten really good</p>
<p>at making it hard for them to emerge.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gotten better at collaboration</p>
<p>and resisting the power,</p>
<p>like authoritarians to come to power.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to go country by country,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re moving past this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re kind of like slowly incrementally,</p>
<p>like moving towards like not scary old school war stuff.</p>
<p>And I think seeing it happen in some of the countries</p>
<p>that at least nominally are like</p>
<p>supposed to have moved past that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s scary because it reminds us that it can happen</p>
<p>like in the places that have moved supposedly,</p>
<p>as hopefully moved past that.</p>
<p>And possibly at a civilization level,</p>
<p>like you said, supply chain collapse</p>
<p>might make people resource constraint,</p>
<p>might make people desperate, angry, hateful, violent,</p>
<p>and drag us right back in.</p>
<p>I mean, supply chain collapse is how,</p>
<p>like the ultimate thing that caused the Middle Ages</p>
<p>was supply chain collapse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like people, because people were reliant</p>
<p>on a certain level of technology,</p>
<p>like people, like you look at like Britain,</p>
<p>like they had glass, like people had aqueducts,</p>
<p>people had like indoor heating and cooling</p>
<p>and like running water and like buy food</p>
<p>from all over the world and trade and markets.</p>
<p>Like people didn&rsquo;t know how to hunt and forage and gather.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re in a similar situation.</p>
<p>We are not educated enough to survive without technology.</p>
<p>So if we have a supply chain collapse</p>
<p>that like limits our access to technology,</p>
<p>there will be like massive starvation and violence</p>
<p>and displacement and war.</p>
<p>Like, you know, it&rsquo;s like, yeah.</p>
<p>In my opinion, it&rsquo;s like the primary marker</p>
<p>of like what a dark age is.</p>
<p>Well, technology is kind of enabling us</p>
<p>to be more resilient in terms of supply chain,</p>
<p>in terms of, to all the different catastrophic events</p>
<p>that happened to us.</p>
<p>Although the pandemic has kind of challenged</p>
<p>our preparedness for the catastrophic.</p>
<p>What do you think is the coolest invention</p>
<p>humans come up with?</p>
<p>The wheel, fire, cooking meat.</p>
<p>Computers. Computers.</p>
<p>Freaking computers. Internet or computers?</p>
<p>Which one?</p>
<p>What do you think the?</p>
<p>Previous technologies, I mean,</p>
<p>may have even been more profound</p>
<p>and moved us to a certain degree,</p>
<p>but I think the computers are what make us homo tech now.</p>
<p>I think this is what, it&rsquo;s a brain augmentation.</p>
<p>And so it like allows for actual evolution.</p>
<p>Like the computers accelerate the degree</p>
<p>to which all the other technologies can also be accelerated.</p>
<p>Would you classify yourself as a homo sapien</p>
<p>or a homo techno?</p>
<p>Definitely homo techno.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re one of the earliest of the species.</p>
<p>I think most of us are.</p>
<p>Like, as I said, like, I think if you</p>
<p>like looked at brain scans of us versus humans</p>
<p>a hundred years ago, it would look very different.</p>
<p>I think we are physiologically different.</p>
<p>Just even the interaction with the devices</p>
<p>has changed our brains.</p>
<p>Well, and if you look at,</p>
<p>a lot of studies are coming out to show that like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a degree of inherited memory.</p>
<p>So some of these physiological changes in theory</p>
<p>should be, we should be passing them on.</p>
<p>So like that&rsquo;s, you know, that&rsquo;s not like a,</p>
<p>an instance of physiological change</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna fizzle out.</p>
<p>In theory, that should progress like to our offspring.</p>
<p>Speaking of offspring,</p>
<p>what advice would you give to a young person,</p>
<p>like in high school,</p>
<p>whether there be an artist, a creative, an engineer,</p>
<p>any kind of career path, or maybe just life in general,</p>
<p>how they can live a life they can be proud of?</p>
<p>I think one of my big thoughts,</p>
<p>and like, especially now having kids,</p>
<p>is that I don&rsquo;t think we spend enough time</p>
<p>teaching creativity.</p>
<p>And I think creativity is a muscle like other things.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of emphasis on, you know,</p>
<p>learn how to play the piano.</p>
<p>And then you can write a song</p>
<p>or like learn the technical stuff.</p>
<p>And then you can do a thing.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s, like, I have a friend</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s like world&rsquo;s greatest guitar player,</p>
<p>like, you know, amazing sort of like producer,</p>
<p>works with other people, but he&rsquo;s really sort of like,</p>
<p>you know, he like engineers and records things</p>
<p>and like does solos,</p>
<p>but he doesn&rsquo;t really like make his own music.</p>
<p>And I was talking to him and I was like,</p>
<p>dude, you&rsquo;re so talented at music.</p>
<p>Like, why don&rsquo;t you make music or whatever?</p>
<p>And he was like, cause I got, I&rsquo;m too old.</p>
<p>I never learned the creative muscle.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, you know, it&rsquo;s embarrassing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like learning the creative muscle</p>
<p>takes a lot of failure.</p>
<p>And it also sort of,</p>
<p>if when you&rsquo;re being creative,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;re throwing paint at a wall</p>
<p>and a lot of stuff will fail.</p>
<p>So like part of it is like a tolerance</p>
<p>for failure and humiliation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s somehow that&rsquo;s easier to develop</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re young or be persist through it</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re young.</p>
<p>Everything is easier to develop when you&rsquo;re young.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And the younger, the better.</p>
<p>It could destroy you.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the shitty thing about creativity.</p>
<p>If, you know, failure could destroy you</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not careful, but that&rsquo;s a risk worth taking.</p>
<p>But also, but at a young age,</p>
<p>developing a tolerance to failure is good.</p>
<p>I fail all the time.</p>
<p>Like I do stupid shit all the time.</p>
<p>Like in public, in private, I get canceled for,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve make all kinds of mistakes,</p>
<p>but I just like am very resilient about making mistakes.</p>
<p>And so then like I do a lot of things</p>
<p>that like other people wouldn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>And like, I think my greatest asset is my creativity.</p>
<p>And I like, I think pain, like tolerance to failure</p>
<p>is just a super essential thing</p>
<p>that should be taught before other things.</p>
<p>Brilliant advice.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I wish everybody encouraged sort of failure more</p>
<p>as opposed to kind of.</p>
<p>Cause we like punish failure.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like, no, like when we were teaching kids,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re like, no, that&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s, you know, like X keeps like will be like wrong.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;ll say like crazy things.</p>
<p>Like X keeps being like, like bubble car, bubble car.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, and you know, I&rsquo;m like, what&rsquo;s a bubble car?</p>
<p>Like, but like, it doesn&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t want to be like, no, you&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you&rsquo;re thinking of weird, crazy shit.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know what a bubble car is, but like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s creating worlds</p>
<p>and they might be internally consistent.</p>
<p>And through that, you might discover something fundamental</p>
<p>about this world.</p>
<p>Yeah, or he&rsquo;ll like rewrite songs,</p>
<p>like with words that he prefers.</p>
<p>So like, instead of baby shark, he says baby car.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>Maybe he&rsquo;s onto something.</p>
<p>Let me ask the big, ridiculous question.</p>
<p>We were kind of dancing around it,</p>
<p>but what do you think is the meaning</p>
<p>of this whole thing we have here of human civilization,</p>
<p>of life on earth, but in general, just life?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>C.</p>
<p>Have you, did you read Nova Scene yet?</p>
<p>By James Lovelock?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing a lot of really good book recommendations here.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t even finished this,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m a huge fraud yet again.</p>
<p>But like really early in the book,</p>
<p>he says this amazing thing.</p>
<p>Like, I feel like everyone&rsquo;s so sad and cynical.</p>
<p>Like everyone&rsquo;s like the Fermi paradox and everyone.</p>
<p>I just keep hearing people being like, fuck,</p>
<p>what if we&rsquo;re alone?</p>
<p>Like, oh no, ah, like, ah, ah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, okay, but like, wait,</p>
<p>what if this is the beginning?</p>
<p>Like in Nova Scene, he says,</p>
<p>this is not gonna be a correct,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t like memorize quotes,</p>
<p>but he says something like,</p>
<p>what if our consciousness, like right now,</p>
<p>like this is the universe waking up?</p>
<p>Like what if instead of discovering the universe,</p>
<p>this is the universe,</p>
<p>like this is the evolution</p>
<p>of the literal universe herself.</p>
<p>Like we are not separate from the universe.</p>
<p>Like this is the universe waking up.</p>
<p>This is the universe seeing herself for the first time.</p>
<p>Like this is.</p>
<p>The universe becoming conscious.</p>
<p>The first time we were a part of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, cause it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>we aren&rsquo;t separate from the universe.</p>
<p>Like this could be like an incredibly sacred moment</p>
<p>and maybe like social media and all this things,</p>
<p>the stuff where we&rsquo;re all getting connected together.</p>
<p>Like maybe these are the neurons connecting</p>
<p>of the like collective super intelligence that is,</p>
<p>Waking up.</p>
<p>The, yeah, like, you know, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>maybe instead of something cynical</p>
<p>or maybe if there&rsquo;s something to discover,</p>
<p>like maybe this is just, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re a blast assist of like some incredible</p>
<p>kind of consciousness or being.</p>
<p>And just like in the first three years of life</p>
<p>or for human children,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll forget about all the suffering</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going through now.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll probably forget about this.</p>
<p>I mean, probably, you know, artificial intelligence</p>
<p>will eventually render us obsolete.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll do it in a malicious way,</p>
<p>but I think probably we are very weak.</p>
<p>The sun is expanding.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know, like, hopefully we can get to Mars,</p>
<p>but like, we&rsquo;re pretty vulnerable.</p>
<p>And I, you know, like,</p>
<p>I think we can coexist for a long time with AI</p>
<p>and we can also probably make ourselves less vulnerable,</p>
<p>but, you know, I just think</p>
<p>consciousness, sentience, self awareness,</p>
<p>like, I think this might be the single greatest</p>
<p>like moment in evolution ever.</p>
<p>And like, maybe this is, you know,</p>
<p>the big, like the true beginning of life.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re just, we&rsquo;re the blue green algae</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re like the single celled organisms</p>
<p>of something amazing.</p>
<p>The universe awakens and this is it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, see, you&rsquo;re an incredible person.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a fascinating mind.</p>
<p>You should definitely do, your friend Liv mentioned</p>
<p>that you guys were thinking of maybe talking.</p>
<p>I would love it if you explored your mind</p>
<p>in this kind of media more and more</p>
<p>by doing a podcast with her or just in any kind of way.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re an awesome person.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an honor to know you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an honor to get to sit down with you late at night,</p>
<p>which is like surreal.</p>
<p>And I really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Thank you for talking today.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I mean, huge honor.</p>
<p>I feel very underqualified to be here, but I&rsquo;m a big fan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been listening to the podcast a lot and yeah,</p>
<p>me and Liv would appreciate any advice and help</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re definitely gonna do that.</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<p>Anytime.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Cool, thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Grimes.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words from Oscar Wilde.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m a dreamer.</p>
<p>For a dreamer is one who can only find her way by moonlight</p>
<p>and her punishment is that she sees the dawn</p>
<p>before the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you</p>
<p>next time.</p>
