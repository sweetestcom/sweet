    <p>Something happened where they forced my hand, and this is the only time that a Soviet agent</p>
<p>was anywhere near me on the territory of the United States.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m waiting for the A train on a dark morning still in Queens, and there&rsquo;s this man in a</p>
<p>black trench coat comes up to me from my right, and he whispers into my ears, you gotta come</p>
<p>back or else you&rsquo;re dead.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Jack Barsky, a former KGB spy, author of Deep Undercover</p>
<p>and the subject of an excellent podcast series called The Agent.</p>
<p>There are very few people who have defected from the KGB and live to tell the story.</p>
<p>It is one of the most powerful intelligence organizations in history.</p>
<p>And this conversation gives a window into its operation, both from an ideological and</p>
<p>psychological perspective, but also it tells the story of a man who lived one heck of an</p>
<p>incredible life.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast, to support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Jack Barsky.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a big basic question.</p>
<p>What is the KGB?</p>
<p>–ö–æ–º–∏—Ç–µ—Ç –ì–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –ë–µ–∑–æ–ø–∞—Å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So that is the Committee of State Security.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an opossumist.</p>
<p>Opossumist is a threat, right?</p>
<p>Threat.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And BS means&hellip;</p>
<p>Without.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I guess that directly translates to security.</p>
<p>Without threat.</p>
<p>So, and don&rsquo;t exist anymore.</p>
<p>It was disbanded when the Soviet Union fell apart and the successor agencies are now the</p>
<p>SVR and the FSB, FSB supposedly the equivalent to the FBI and SVR, the CIA.</p>
<p>But the SVR is relatively weak and the FSB has taken on a lot of espionage and active</p>
<p>measures and they&rsquo;re much bigger and stronger.</p>
<p>But the most capable intelligence agency in Russia is the GRU, Military Intelligence.</p>
<p>That nobody knows very much about.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>When I was in the KGB, I had no idea that there was military intelligence.</p>
<p>Nobody ever mentioned anything like that.</p>
<p>And by the way, I recently had the pleasure to give a talk at the DIA.</p>
<p>When they reached out to me, I didn&rsquo;t know they existed either.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always the question.</p>
<p>If you want to be an intelligence agency, should the world know anything about you?</p>
<p>Because in some sense, you want to create the legend in order to attract great competent</p>
<p>individuals to work for you, but at the same time, you want it to be shrouded in complete</p>
<p>mystery.</p>
<p>If nobody knows you exist, you might be able to operate well as an intelligence agency.</p>
<p>That is fascinating.</p>
<p>But FSB is the thing that carries the flag of KGB, KGB being probably one of, if not</p>
<p>the most sort of infamous, famous, infamous, and powerful intelligence agencies in history</p>
<p>ever.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>It was founded in 1954 after the death of Stalin.</p>
<p>In writing your book, you&rsquo;ve looked back at the predecessors of the history.</p>
<p>Is there some way in which the KGB is grounded in the culture, the spirit, the soul of the</p>
<p>KGB?</p>
<p>Its predecessors.</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>They just changed names and they changed personnel rather frequently, and that had something</p>
<p>to do with Stalin&rsquo;s paranoia.</p>
<p>From between 1923, and I don&rsquo;t remember what, I think it may have been the NKVD at that</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>It started as the Chika, and then it became the GPU, the NKVD, but with those name changes,</p>
<p>you also had changes at the top.</p>
<p>Between 1923 and 1953, when Stalin died, that is 30 years, they had eight heads of intelligence,</p>
<p>and of those eight, six were executed when they were replaced.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an indication that this was an organization that ate itself from the inside.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union was the only dictatorship in history that did not rest its powers on</p>
<p>the military.</p>
<p>They rested its powers on the intelligence apparatus, and that thing was unstable.</p>
<p>So you know where that leads.</p>
<p>Eventually, if you rest your power on something that is made out of bricks that don&rsquo;t hold</p>
<p>a lot of load, it will fall apart.</p>
<p>On sand.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Why was it unstable, would you say?</p>
<p>What of human nature makes it unstable?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the paranoia.</p>
<p>Stalin was always worried about the most powerful people coming after him.</p>
<p>So he proactively killed off heads of the KGB, and he had this great purge where he</p>
<p>got rid of a lot of his generals, really capable generals, and that cost him dearly when World</p>
<p>War II started, because he started off with a force that wasn&rsquo;t as capable as it could</p>
<p>have been.</p>
<p>Was it paranoia at all levels?</p>
<p>I believe so.</p>
<p>It comes from the top.</p>
<p>And so if the top doesn&rsquo;t trust you, you always have to worry about your peers snitching on</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>And I think we have a very similar situation in Russia today, and in this kind of atmosphere,</p>
<p>the truth will never get to the top.</p>
<p>So no matter what moral rules the organization operates under, trust is fundamental to its</p>
<p>competence.</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>And I want to extend this to my own existence, and this is kind of strange.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost dichotomous, because I was running around lying to everybody, and I couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fundamentally be trusted.</p>
<p>But the relationship that I had with the KGB was based on trust.</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t trust me, they don&rsquo;t send me out.</p>
<p>And if I don&rsquo;t trust them, I&rsquo;m not going.</p>
<p>And I eventually broke that trust, and they knew there was always that danger.</p>
<p>They knew that because something about you or just something about human beings that</p>
<p>can be broken.</p>
<p>There were hints about how long my assignment would be, so 10 to 12 years.</p>
<p>And you see, it makes sense.</p>
<p>I was becoming an American, and over time, I would become more and more American, and</p>
<p>there was always a chance that I liked it more here than there, that I was really successful</p>
<p>in what I was supposed to do.</p>
<p>And it sort of happened, but in my case, it happened because I fathered a child who I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t want to leave when they wanted me back.</p>
<p>Love always screws up your employment competence, yes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>But they thought that I had an anchor at home because I had a wife and a son at home, which</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to worry about them if you defect.</p>
<p>Because in the past, the KGB would go after family ruthlessly.</p>
<p>Including perhaps violence?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is a hard question about the KGB because it&rsquo;s one of the most ruthless organizations,</p>
<p>but in general, are there lines, KGB agents at every level of the hierarchy that they</p>
<p>would not cross, political, legal, ethical, or does anything goes to achieve the goal?</p>
<p>I was only in touch with two types of agents, the technical experts, the ones that taught</p>
<p>me tradecraft, and they were like engineers and they were in charge of the secret writing</p>
<p>and the Morse code, shortwave radio reception, decryption, encryption, and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Those were just doing their job.</p>
<p>And the others, the ones that trained me, that prepared me for life in the United States,</p>
<p>they were nice people.</p>
<p>They were elegant people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they would not fit into the stereotype of the ruthless gun carrying agent.</p>
<p>Is it possible that you would not be aware of the parts of the KGB, I mean, it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>modular.</p>
<p>Would you?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that you&rsquo;re not aware of the parts of the KGB that are the quote unquote</p>
<p>muscle.</p>
<p>Oh, I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I would find out afterwards, after I retired and started doing some research, I had no</p>
<p>clue.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re kind of operating in a bubble.</p>
<p>Oh, very much so.</p>
<p>I mean, this is what the KGB did really, really well, compartmentalization, and that was based</p>
<p>on the communist movement while it was still underground.</p>
<p>The cells were very small, so that maybe there were three, four members in one cell that</p>
<p>knew one another, and then they had a liaison to another cell.</p>
<p>The bottom line is if you got one of those folks were caught, they could maybe betray</p>
<p>four people or three, something like that, and the KGB continued with that tradition.</p>
<p>I have reason to believe that my handler, the person in Moscow that sort of directed</p>
<p>me and made decisions what to do and where to go, never met me personally.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason to.</p>
<p>This actually was a big advantage over other intelligence services because you look at</p>
<p>what the CIA does.</p>
<p>Everybody blabs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of leaks coming out of American intelligence.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s as many leaks coming out of the Mossad.</p>
<p>Strong words from Jack Barsky, by the way.</p>
<p>That is a question I want to ask a little more systematically.</p>
<p>Is there something unique about the KGB compared to the other intelligence agencies?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk British intelligence, MI6, Mossad, CIA.</p>
<p>Is there unique cultures, spirits, souls of the different organizations that maybe somehow</p>
<p>connect to the structures of government, connect maybe the values of the people, those kinds</p>
<p>of things?</p>
<p>I believe we were all pretty much strong believers in communism and the future of the world being&hellip;</p>
<p>In KGB?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I think that unified us to a large degree, even the technicians.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t something like, yeah, yeah, the parents believe this thing, but we know the</p>
<p>truth.</p>
<p>You really believe the story of communism.</p>
<p>Absolutely did.</p>
<p>And you need to look at the timeframe.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union after World War II made quite a bit of progress in influencing the Third</p>
<p>World.</p>
<p>I still remember when I was in middle school, we had a map, the map of the world, and it</p>
<p>was color coded.</p>
<p>So red was communism, that was the Soviet Union and the Eastern states, and then blue</p>
<p>was capitalism.</p>
<p>And then we had green, which were the Third World countries, and the green slowly turned</p>
<p>pink because a lot of Third World governments, like I&rsquo;m looking at Angola, I&rsquo;m looking at</p>
<p>Vietnam, a lot of these countries were very sympathetic to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>And so we sort of knew that this would go on like that, and eventually we would take</p>
<p>over and pretty much overtake, that was the myth, overtake the United States, not only</p>
<p>militarily but also in terms of industrial production and so forth.</p>
<p>That was a stupid pipe dream.</p>
<p>The military, it was a standoff, as we know.</p>
<p>A stupid pipe dream.</p>
<p>Hitler had a stupid pipe dream that he executed it exceptionally effectively and on, if not</p>
<p>for a handful of military mistakes, the world could look very different today.</p>
<p>Well, the biggest one being invading the Soviet Union, particularly at the time that he did</p>
<p>it because he ran into the same thing that Napoleon ran into General Winter.</p>
<p>Well within, so Operation Barbarossa, within that he could have made different decisions.</p>
<p>For example, attacking, skipping Kiev and attacking Moscow directly, overthrowing the</p>
<p>government.</p>
<p>So marching, I guess that would be learning lessons from Napoleon as opposed to a different</p>
<p>kind of distribution of forces and then getting bogged down in the winter.</p>
<p>But the point is these ambitions sometimes do, the ambitions of empires sometimes do</p>
<p>materialize in the growth and the building and the establishment of those empires and</p>
<p>those empires write the history books in such a way that we don&rsquo;t think of them as empires</p>
<p>or we certainly don&rsquo;t think of them as the bad guys.</p>
<p>They write the history books, therefore they&rsquo;re the good guys.</p>
<p>And right now America has effectively written the book about the good guys.</p>
<p>I happen to believe that book, but it&rsquo;s, we should be humbled and open minded to realize</p>
<p>that that is in fact what is happening is effective empires write the history books</p>
<p>and tell us stories and tell us propaganda and tell us narratives that we believe because</p>
<p>we are human beings and we love to get together and believe ideas.</p>
<p>We love to dream of a beautiful world and try to build that beautiful world together</p>
<p>in the United States.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a beautiful world.</p>
<p>The freedom of respect of human rights of all men are created equal pursuit of happiness.</p>
<p>You know, it always sounds good.</p>
<p>If you look at what the dream of communism is, it sure as heck in its words on the surface</p>
<p>sounds good.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Respect for the workers.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The working class, the lower classes that have been trodden on that have been stolen</p>
<p>from by the powerful, they deserve to have the money, the power, the respect that they</p>
<p>have earned through their hard work.</p>
<p>Sounds great.</p>
<p>And everybody gets along and we just have to, you know, uh, all men are wonderful people.</p>
<p>And if they, if they go bad, it has something to do with the fact that they have, they have</p>
<p>been oppressed, right?</p>
<p>And uh, that dream just never worked out.</p>
<p>And even, even it is when you think about it and I didn&rsquo;t think about it when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>young, you know, you just emotionally, you accept it.</p>
<p>But when you think about it, somehow, uh, that new wonderful organization has to organize</p>
<p>itself even though Lenin predicted that the state eventually would go away.</p>
<p>Well, how does it, how does that work?</p>
<p>Then you have like anarchy, right?</p>
<p>You have to have an organization.</p>
<p>The only way to really organize a large number of people is with a hierarchy.</p>
<p>So and who gets to the top, the ones that are, that want to go to the top, the ones</p>
<p>that believe in themselves, the ones, the ones that know better than everybody else.</p>
<p>And once you have that hierarchy established, uh, there is no guarantee that it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that it won&rsquo;t go bad.</p>
<p>And actually when you look at history, every such hierarchy has gone bad.</p>
<p>You know, you look at Cuba, for instance, I believe Fidel Castro was a, an honest revolutionary.</p>
<p>I do believe that.</p>
<p>And so what did Cuba turn into?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about, and you speak about Vladimir Putin in this way, but let&rsquo;s step</p>
<p>away from that for a second.</p>
<p>Is there something about being an honest revolutionary that wants to do good for their country and</p>
<p>you start to believe that, you know, better than everyone else how to do good on the country</p>
<p>and you very well might first, but then somehow that grows into a distortion field where,</p>
<p>you know, you keep believing, you know, what&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And all the people who disagree with you, you stop seeing them as having a point.</p>
<p>You instead see them as like, um, um, evil manipulators of the truth that are actually</p>
<p>trying to hurt people for their own greed, for their own power.</p>
<p>And you will protect the people because you know, what&rsquo;s good in the case of Stalin.</p>
<p>I, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know, but it seems like he really believed that communism would bring</p>
<p>about a much better world.</p>
<p>I mean, there was a sense the, you have to crack a few eggs to make an omelet, this idea</p>
<p>that sacrifice is necessary to bring about a greater world.</p>
<p>And then the other aspect is sort of ruling by terror, creating terrorism, justified political</p>
<p>mechanism to achieve a better world.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t, I mean, perhaps he had to do that to be able to sleep at night with the</p>
<p>atrocities he&rsquo;s committing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s, I think he believed he will bring about a better world.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And by the way, the terror didn&rsquo;t start with Stalin.</p>
<p>It started right after the Bolsheviks took over when Lenin told Mr. Dzerzhinsky, Commodore</p>
<p>Dzerzhinsky to build the Cheka and then execute the, this is what he called it, the red terror.</p>
<p>So at the birth of the Soviet Union, there was already terror and it was deliberate.</p>
<p>And it also was, it wasn&rsquo;t just focused on the enemies, it was focused on whoever you</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>There was no rule of law, there was no court cases, people were just pulled out of their</p>
<p>apartments and shot on sight.</p>
<p>And this was done by revolutionaries who were convinced that eventually, these sacrifices</p>
<p>had to be made and eventually that would lead to a much better planet.</p>
<p>And the populace believed this too, that those sacrifices in part.</p>
<p>I mean, this is such a dark thing about dictatorships is you believe it, but you&rsquo;re also too afraid</p>
<p>to question your beliefs.</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re not directly afraid, but almost like, I don&rsquo;t know what that is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s almost like a subconscious fear.</p>
<p>Like don&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s a dark room with a locked door, don&rsquo;t look in that door.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t check that door.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something about the United States that says, especially modern culture, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like go to that door first and sort of question everything kind of, that&rsquo;s the power of the</p>
<p>freedom of speech and the freedom of the press, but you can get almost become too critical</p>
<p>and too cynical of your own culture in that way.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a balance to strike, of course, but man, if communism is not a lesson of human</p>
<p>nature, I don&rsquo;t know what is, but you believed, without thinking too much about it, you believed</p>
<p>in the story of, what did you see, just, you know, I came from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>What did you maybe feel that&rsquo;s right and good about communism, about the vision of communism?</p>
<p>Do you remember?</p>
<p>I think the biggest impetus in me believing in communism was that the communists, just</p>
<p>before Hitler took over, the communists were the only force in Germany that fought the</p>
<p>Nazis in the streets, and that&rsquo;s a historic truth.</p>
<p>And communists were hunted down by the Nazis, killed, put in concentration camps.</p>
<p>And so what we knew, what we were taught, and I think that was a huge unforced error</p>
<p>by the Western countries, particularly the United States, that there were ex Nazis in</p>
<p>the government in West Germany.</p>
<p>And the most famous one was Reinhard Galen, who was in charge, was the general in charge</p>
<p>of the intelligence on the Eastern Front under Hitler.</p>
<p>And when the Allied won the war, it was decided that Galen was too important, his knowledge</p>
<p>and his organization was too important to not use.</p>
<p>So he was coopted by the CIA and eventually wound up being the head of the Bundesnachrichtendienst,</p>
<p>the CIA of West Germany.</p>
<p>That gave us, us, when I say us, the East German party, a huge propaganda victory.</p>
<p>I wanted to, because the emotional aspect of this was as follows.</p>
<p>When we were in, juniors in high school, and in those days, you were only allowed to go</p>
<p>to high school if you were in the top 10% of students, okay?</p>
<p>So this was going to be the next set of ruling elite in the country.</p>
<p>We were sent, we were required to visit a concentration camp.</p>
<p>And if you know what we as 17 year olds were made to look at, it was gut wrenching.</p>
<p>How can men do something like that to men, piles of corpses, lampshades made out of human</p>
<p>skin because that skin had tattoos on them, and shrunken heads like the size of my fist.</p>
<p>I mean, the girls all cried, and it made a huge impression.</p>
<p>And that was the Nazis, and the Communists defeated the Nazis.</p>
<p>They were the good guys.</p>
<p>Of course, in hindsight, if the Communists had come to power, it would have been just</p>
<p>the other way around, as we know, given the example of Stalin and Mao, right?</p>
<p>But we didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>From the Russian and Soviet perspective, the Communist regime banded together to win the</p>
<p>Great Patriotic War.</p>
<p>And that was the second one, the big brother, the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>I mean, when I was approached by the KGB, that was like, oh, I felt so honored.</p>
<p>So we should say that we&rsquo;re talking about East Germany, that you&rsquo;re from East Germany.</p>
<p>Can you describe, you were born four years and what is it?</p>
<p>Yeah, four years.</p>
<p>10 days?</p>
<p>Yeah, sort of.</p>
<p>Very good.</p>
<p>After Germany&rsquo;s unconditional surrender in World War II.</p>
<p>So what is East Germany?</p>
<p>What is West Germany?</p>
<p>What is East and West Germany?</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the historical context here?</p>
<p>What is World War II again?</p>
<p>And then, let&rsquo;s do it for some&hellip;</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to go to World War I, the result of which actually seeded World War II in some</p>
<p>respect.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a long history, yes.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s start with World War II.</p>
<p>So when Hitler came to power, he and his leadership decided that the Germans needed more what</p>
<p>they call Lebensraum, that means room to live.</p>
<p>And they would start expanding and they went into France, they took Belgium, the Netherlands,</p>
<p>they annexed Austria and got a piece of Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>And then they decided to march into the Soviet Union after they took Poland.</p>
<p>Cut up Poland together with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>They were friends.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>There was a nonaggression pact that was signed by Ribbentrop and Molotov, right?</p>
<p>I think both parties knew that eventually they would fall apart.</p>
<p>But at the time, it gave the Soviet Union a little more piece of Poland and a little</p>
<p>more time to prepare what they thought might happen down the road.</p>
<p>And the Germans had the time and the ability to pretty much conquer all of Western Europe.</p>
<p>Do you think Stalin really knew that it&rsquo;s gonna fall apart?</p>
<p>Why would somebody like Stalin trust somebody like Hitler?</p>
<p>But why did he blunder so bad not to read the intelligence that was coming his way?</p>
<p>Oh, he doesn&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>The troops are amassing on the border of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t trust his own intelligence apparatus.</p>
<p>Oh, boy.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one example.</p>
<p>There was a German communist who went underground when Hitler took over and he went to Japan</p>
<p>as a journalist.</p>
<p>His name is Richard Sorge.</p>
<p>Richard Sorge had really, really good intel about what the Japanese would do and not do.</p>
<p>I forgot exactly what it was, but it came to Moscow and Stalin totally ignored it.</p>
<p>And when Sorge was captured by the Japanese, the Soviet Union denied that he was one of</p>
<p>them there, so he was executed, the paranoia, again, does a lot of damage.</p>
<p>When you don&rsquo;t believe your own intelligence apparatus, why bother having one?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there&hellip;</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s contradictory information coming in from the intelligence apparatus,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s difficult.</p>
<p>I mean, first of all, nobody likes to be disagreed with, especially when you become more and</p>
<p>more powerful, and then the intelligence apparatus is probably giving information you don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s often negative information about, basically, information that says that the decisions you</p>
<p>made in the past are not great decisions, and that&rsquo;s a difficult truth to deal with.</p>
<p>So in the modern times, if we hop around briefly, Vladimir Putin has been not happy with the</p>
<p>intelligence of the FSB, thereby, at least if you read the news, choosing to put more</p>
<p>priority to the GRU for the intelligence in Ukraine.</p>
<p>But I guess I suppose the same story happens there, as it does throughout history, is paranoia.</p>
<p>I give you an example that comes from a very reliable source, and that my best German friend</p>
<p>worked as a chemist in the Stasi, East German intelligence.</p>
<p>And he eventually, he rose to the rank of major and was in charge of the forgery department.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very likely that he made passports that I use to travel.</p>
<p>He was aware that there was intelligence that was collected.</p>
<p>The Stasi was really good.</p>
<p>They had about a thousand people in West Germany, undercover agents, some of them in government,</p>
<p>and the central committee of the party, the decision makers ignored it because it didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>quite fit in their worldview, it didn&rsquo;t quite fit into their plans.</p>
<p>So and one delicious thing that I just want to add on to this, when Gorbachev wrote his</p>
<p>book about Perestroika and Glasnost, the East German rulers did not like it.</p>
<p>They were much, much more orthodox.</p>
<p>So they had to print the books in translation, guess where they wound up.</p>
<p>They were piled up in the hallways of the Stasi.</p>
<p>They bought the entire print run.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>So but let&rsquo;s backtrack.</p>
<p>So Operation Barbarossa, invasion of Hitler to the Soviet Union, and then hopefully that</p>
<p>leads us all the way to East Germany, West Germany after the end of the war.</p>
<p>So what happened was the Soviet Union rolled into the eastern part of Germany and the Western</p>
<p>allies took a larger chunk, which was eventually, it was occupied by the three allies, the French,</p>
<p>the English and the Americans, and the eastern part was occupied by Soviet troops.</p>
<p>And the Soviet troops actually conquered Berlin.</p>
<p>But in a contract, they decided that Berlin would be ruled by the four allies and they</p>
<p>all had free access to that city.</p>
<p>I was born in the East German part, which very quickly became ruled by communists, socialists,</p>
<p>the Communist Party and the Socialist Party United, but the leaders of that new party</p>
<p>were all communists.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nevertheless called democratic.</p>
<p>Yes, German Democratic Republic, which was formed a couple of months after I was born.</p>
<p>I was born into a remote southeastern corner of East Germany.</p>
<p>And interestingly enough, genetically, I&rsquo;m only half German.</p>
<p>The other half is Czech and Polish.</p>
<p>Because where I grew up, I could walk to the Nysa River, which was the border with Poland,</p>
<p>and it was only about an hour by bus to get to the Czech border.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m a mix.</p>
<p>So okay, so East Germany after the war was communist, socialist, and then the West Germany</p>
<p>was representing the Western world with democracy.</p>
<p>And what the United States did, this was really, really very forward looking, very strategic,</p>
<p>the Marshall Plan to rebuild the economy in the West as compared to what the Soviet Union</p>
<p>did.</p>
<p>Whatever they hadn&rsquo;t destroyed on the way in, they took with them on the way out for</p>
<p>reparations because they had every right to do that.</p>
<p>But it was not a good idea because East Germany was always behind in economic development</p>
<p>to their Western counterpart.</p>
<p>So when you were young, as today, but when you were young, you were clearly an exceptional</p>
<p>student.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a brilliant academic superstar.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to your childhood.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the fond memory from childhood that you have in being woken up to the beauty of</p>
<p>this world and sort of being curious about all the mysteries around you that I think</p>
<p>ultimately lead to academic success?</p>
<p>Or was it&hellip;</p>
<p>The fondest memory that comes to mind is my first kiss.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>Do you want to go to the details of that?</p>
<p>What did you make of that kiss?</p>
<p>What did that teach you about yourself and human nature and all that?</p>
<p>It taught me only in hindsight.</p>
<p>At the time, I was just like, my God, I was head over heels in love.</p>
<p>I was 16 years old.</p>
<p>And I knew in those days, I admired girls.</p>
<p>I knew the girls were like sort of magical beings.</p>
<p>They were not capable of doing evil things.</p>
<p>They were beautiful and they had to be adored.</p>
<p>And one of them actually loved me too.</p>
<p>She came after me initially.</p>
<p>And that too was magical for you.</p>
<p>Oh my God, yeah.</p>
<p>And literally, I dedicated&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I started studying.</p>
<p>Up until that point, I just did whatever I had to do to be in A minus students.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when I started studying.</p>
<p>And every A that I got, I dedicated to her, sometimes explicitly, because I knew I was</p>
<p>going to take care of her as I grew up.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to have to work hard in this world to be somebody that could be adored</p>
<p>by those you love.</p>
<p>Yes, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>You know that kiss, the next day, I was running around in school with a grin on my face.</p>
<p>And maybe that in some way, that grin never fades.</p>
<p>So what about the heartbreak that followed?</p>
<p>But just to expand on this a little more, because that passion that I had was an indication</p>
<p>that eventually love would play a big role in my life.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t aware of it.</p>
<p>I was just directed at this one girl.</p>
<p>But you understood that that feeling that taught you something, like that you&rsquo;re somebody</p>
<p>that can feel those things.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a strong part of who you are.</p>
<p>And therefore, it will also be a part of directing your life trajectory.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we were an item for two years.</p>
<p>I lost my virginity.</p>
<p>She was not a virgin at the time.</p>
<p>My competitor was, he studied medicine in college already.</p>
<p>In which ways was he better than you?</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>He was older, and he was more experienced.</p>
<p>And he was going to be a doctor.</p>
<p>But I was there, and he was not.</p>
<p>The presence wins.</p>
<p>But you still had big dreams.</p>
<p>You wanted to be a tenured professor.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>So you still want to outdo that guy.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>And she eventually told me that he was not in the picture anymore.</p>
<p>So it was back and forth, back and forth.</p>
<p>And our senior year, we were an item, and I was just dreaming of the future.</p>
<p>But we didn&rsquo;t figure out that in those days, if she went to college in Berlin and I went</p>
<p>to college in Jena, and the distance between the two cities was too much for a weekend</p>
<p>visit, public transportation was very slow, and nobody had cars.</p>
<p>So the circumstance of life, you drifted apart.</p>
<p>And so we interacted with a couple of letters, and then I got the goodbye letter.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>That hurt?</p>
<p>I can still feel it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>You could feel the pain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s still part of love.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that the pain of loss is still part of love.</p>
<p>And then you kind of change that.</p>
<p>You shape it, and you give that love in deeper, more profound ways to future people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very well put.</p>
<p>But at the time, it emptied me out.</p>
<p>If I had a tendency to have suicidal thoughts, I might have killed myself.</p>
<p>Would you say that was one of the darker moments of your life?</p>
<p>Let me see.</p>
<p>As a single moment, yes.</p>
<p>So I still remember we had a mail slot in the front door, and I wasn&rsquo;t expecting a letter</p>
<p>any day, and there was the letter.</p>
<p>I go upstairs into my bedroom, and I open it, and I read it, and just like the life</p>
<p>went out of me.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just there alone, and you have to experience this pain alone.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re deeply alone in this world.</p>
<p>Yes, because there was no emotional relationship with my parents.</p>
<p>I literally had nobody.</p>
<p>So this love you have in you had no place to go.</p>
<p>It was choked off, all right?</p>
<p>But what I did was I wanted to go on, right?</p>
<p>And so I threw myself into the study of chemistry.</p>
<p>I outworked all of my fellow students in a big way.</p>
<p>I worked my ass off, and since I was pretty smart, too, I just aced practically everything.</p>
<p>And for the first two years in college, and look, we go to college, there are all these</p>
<p>pretty girls, and there&rsquo;s dances and everything.</p>
<p>We had this great student club where I didn&rsquo;t look at any girls.</p>
<p>Eventually I knew I was going to, you know, want to have female companionship, but love?</p>
<p>Uh uh.</p>
<p>No more.</p>
<p>That hurts.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a song that goes, love hurts.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know that one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually many songs that have a similar message, yes.</p>
<p>So during that time, during your excellence, just being an exceptional student of chemistry,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go to your story.</p>
<p>So in your book, Deep Undercover, My Secret Life and Tangled Allegiances as a KGB Spy</p>
<p>in America, and in the really, really excellent podcast series that I&rsquo;ve been listening to,</p>
<p>people should definitely listen to, it&rsquo;s called The Agent.</p>
<p>You document your time as a KGB spy before, during, and after.</p>
<p>Can you tell the story of when you first were contacted by the KGB, how you were invited,</p>
<p>the offer to join was made?</p>
<p>Well, it was a big surprise, and I never thought of myself as a potential agent.</p>
<p>You know, I was going to be a tenured professor and join the ruling elite, because in Europe,</p>
<p>tenured professors are few.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like in the United States, you know, anybody who teaches at colleges has a title</p>
<p>of professor.</p>
<p>Easy now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a criticism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 100%.</p>
<p>So we should also clarify that, tenured professor or not, it is a very prestigious position</p>
<p>throughout history of Europe.</p>
<p>I would say, especially communists, I don&rsquo;t actually know the full landscape of the respect,</p>
<p>but at least in the Soviet Union where I grew up, it&rsquo;s a prestigious position.</p>
<p>Absolutely was.</p>
<p>And the town of Yanuk had about 100,000 people live there, and I would, it&rsquo;s a wild guess,</p>
<p>but maybe 30 tenured professors, and they were part of the ruling elite.</p>
<p>I was trying to do as much as I can to live the good life, right?</p>
<p>You know, have access to things that are nice.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I think the powerful thing about being a professor in that context of East</p>
<p>Germany is the prestige.</p>
<p>And the feeling of superiority.</p>
<p>You know, I was full of myself.</p>
<p>You know, when you are the best of the best, and in my third year I received a scholarship,</p>
<p>the Karl Marx Scholarship, that was limited to 100 concurrent recipients in the country.</p>
<p>So my God, you know, I was full of myself.</p>
<p>I believed in myself, hook, line, and sinker.</p>
<p>And I was also, I got a lot of accolades from teachers and fellow students.</p>
<p>They were feeding the ego, the old, I mean, you have to believe in yourself often when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re young to truly, to excel.</p>
<p>And you sure as heck did.</p>
<p>But you know, as a balance, you need a mentor, somebody who puts things in perspective, and</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have one.</p>
<p>My father was a nonentity and nobody else.</p>
<p>They all looked up to me.</p>
<p>I was an up and coming guy, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no father figure that put you in your place.</p>
<p>Not at all.</p>
<p>And I give you one extreme example.</p>
<p>It was down the road when I fathered a child out of wedlock.</p>
<p>That was in my fifth year, I believe.</p>
<p>The Communist Party in East Germany was very moralistic.</p>
<p>If you did that, they would have a talk with you and give you whatever, a severe reprimand.</p>
<p>Nobody even mentioned a word about this.</p>
<p>So yeah, so this is how this ego gets nurtured.</p>
<p>But anyway, getting back to how the KGB came in contact.</p>
<p>So they most likely got knowledge of me by, you know, looking at Stasi records.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s Stasi?</p>
<p>That was East German secret police, Staatssicherheit, security for the state.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s that word security again.</p>
<p>And they pretty much kept a record on everybody in the country.</p>
<p>And so when you look through this, and this is what the KGB was looking for.</p>
<p>They were looking for candidates, particularly for this kind of job that they had in mind</p>
<p>for me, for candidates who were not, you know, in their mid 20s, who were not fully developed</p>
<p>yet, but mature enough to get there and still young enough, right?</p>
<p>Because at that level of maturity, you can test whether they can handle this kind of</p>
<p>job.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Absolutely right.</p>
<p>And one day I got a knock on my door and my dorm room door was on a Saturday.</p>
<p>And they knew that I was by myself.</p>
<p>How did they know it?</p>
<p>We had a, I pieced this together.</p>
<p>We had an exchange student from the Soviet Union, and he was next door to me.</p>
<p>And he befriended me.</p>
<p>So he got to know me a little bit.</p>
<p>And the pattern was that my roommate would always go home for the weekend.</p>
<p>And of course they also knew which door to knock on, even though there were no nameplates.</p>
<p>Somebody knocks.</p>
<p>And I knew it was a stranger because if it had been a student, the pattern was that we</p>
<p>would knock on the door and then go in.</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t wait for somebody to let us in.</p>
<p>So I waited for 10 seconds and he didn&rsquo;t come in.</p>
<p>I knew that it was a stranger.</p>
<p>I said, come on in.</p>
<p>And in came a person who spoke fluent German.</p>
<p>So that was not a KGB guy.</p>
<p>That was a collaborator.</p>
<p>And so he started making a bunch of small talk.</p>
<p>He introduced himself as a representative of Carl Zeiss Jena, which was the optics company</p>
<p>that made really, really good optical instruments, was one of the best in the world.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like the super prestigious company in that place.</p>
<p>And he said that he was a representative of that company and he would just want to find</p>
<p>out what my plans were after graduating from college.</p>
<p>And at that point I knew he wasn&rsquo;t from Carl Zeiss Jena because in those days there was</p>
<p>no recruitment.</p>
<p>When you were done, if you were in the top 10% of the graduates, you would most likely</p>
<p>pick to stay and get a doctorate.</p>
<p>And the rest of them were assigned.</p>
<p>You had no choice.</p>
<p>So that guy was an idiot.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t know the basics about&hellip;</p>
<p>You interviewed him a little bit to understand, like feel out, is this guy full of shit?</p>
<p>Because yeah, he&rsquo;s a stranger showing up to your dorm room.</p>
<p>I knew that at that point, I knew he was a Stasi, which is wrong, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>because he was German and I had no idea that the KGB would be involved.</p>
<p>So sorry to pause briefly, did you have a sense, did people know that there&rsquo;s a Stasi</p>
<p>type of organization, that there is a large number of people doing this kind of work in</p>
<p>East Germany in order for you to make that guess?</p>
<p>Yeah, we knew that the Stasi existed.</p>
<p>We even had our James Bond, we had a series called the Invisible Visor where a Stasi employee</p>
<p>in East German would go into West Germany and hunt down Nazis.</p>
<p>So yes, the Stasi was known to be there.</p>
<p>And admired in part or feared or both?</p>
<p>I thought they were necessary and I admired them.</p>
<p>James Bond.</p>
<p>Yes, the reason I did so because I had no information to the contrary.</p>
<p>I never knew anybody personally or even somewhat removed who was followed by the Stasi, was</p>
<p>put in jail.</p>
<p>I had no clue.</p>
<p>I had no clue that they did a lot of damage and that they were doing a lot of surveillance</p>
<p>of the East German population the same way the KGB did for the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>So for me to be talking to somebody from the Stasi, it raised my interest.</p>
<p>I was curious what comes next because I sort of knew something interesting would be coming</p>
<p>at me and I had no other thoughts about that at that point.</p>
<p>So when he was finally, when he went for the kill by reversing himself, he said, you know,</p>
<p>I got to tell you that I really, I really am not from Karl Stasi, you know, I&rsquo;m from</p>
<p>the government.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Thank you for pointing that out.</p>
<p>And then he asked this question, he says, can you imagine to one day work for the government?</p>
<p>And so I gave a pretty clever answer.</p>
<p>I said, yes, but not as a chemist.</p>
<p>So I answered the question that he didn&rsquo;t ask.</p>
<p>I helped him out.</p>
<p>So we made an arrangement to meet for lunch, which in Germany is the main meal at the number</p>
<p>one restaurant in Vienna, you know, I still remember what I ate.</p>
<p>What was that?</p>
<p>Rump steak with butter on top and French fries, it was my favorite.</p>
<p>Anyway, so when I get to the restaurant, I saw this fellow sitting in the back there</p>
<p>at the table and there was another person at the table.</p>
<p>So I was a little bit hesitant because in those days it was not unusual for perfect</p>
<p>strangers to share a table because there wasn&rsquo;t enough tables and chairs and so forth.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t know if I could approach him, but he got up and came to me and he took me</p>
<p>to the table and he said, I want to introduce Herman.</p>
<p>We work with our Soviet comrades.</p>
<p>Aha, KGB.</p>
<p>And then he disappeared.</p>
<p>He says, I got something else to do.</p>
<p>I never knew his name.</p>
<p>He just handed me over to the KGB.</p>
<p>What was the relationship between the KGB and Astazies as collaborators, close collaborators</p>
<p>or just distant associates?</p>
<p>They were pretty close collaborators as I told you that they bought forged documents</p>
<p>that the Germans made because the Germans were better at forgery.</p>
<p>They also exchanged information, but they didn&rsquo;t trust each other 100% and I tell you</p>
<p>why I know that.</p>
<p>So they recruited me to send me to West Germany.</p>
<p>As I already said, East Germany had a thousand agents over there.</p>
<p>Why would they want to have their own?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This is a fascinating internal and external dynamic of distrust.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So there you are welcomed by the KGB.</p>
<p>When did the offer, the invite come?</p>
<p>Well, that took a while.</p>
<p>So Herman and I had an unofficial relationship for about a year and a half.</p>
<p>I would meet him once a week, once every two weeks, initially in his car, but then he took</p>
<p>me to a conspirational flat that was an apartment that was occupied by a party member, a lady,</p>
<p>single lady.</p>
<p>When we came in, she would leave, she left us tea and cookies and then we could freely</p>
<p>talk.</p>
<p>He also at that time gave me some West German literature magazines to read, which was of</p>
<p>course forbidden.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m starting to feel somewhat special and as we were talking about what they had in</p>
<p>mind for me in general, I knew that I was going to be even more special because I would</p>
<p>be above the law.</p>
<p>I would operate outside the law of the countries I would go to as well as East Germany because</p>
<p>the magazines and eventually when I joined up, they told me I had better watch West German</p>
<p>television, which was also not explicitly prohibited, but it was something that could</p>
<p>get you in trouble.</p>
<p>So on many levels, you&rsquo;re super special, you&rsquo;re the James Bond.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What was that recruitment testing process like?</p>
<p>Testing whether you have what it takes to be a KGB agent?</p>
<p>First of all, we had very in depth talks, Herman and I, about life and I still am very</p>
<p>honest in sharing my feelings.</p>
<p>Philosophical or personal?</p>
<p>Personal.</p>
<p>I even told him that I was shy around the girls.</p>
<p>He was giving you relationship advice or what?</p>
<p>How old was he?</p>
<p>So what was the dynamic?</p>
<p>Can you tell me, was it a father, son?</p>
<p>No, older brother.</p>
<p>Older brother.</p>
<p>Yeah, he was maybe in his early to mid 30s and I was maybe 10 years younger.</p>
<p>And what languages did he speak?</p>
<p>He spoke German pretty well.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s originally from Russia?</p>
<p>Yeah, with a Russian accent.</p>
<p>So I got in trouble one time with him when I asked him, is your real name German?</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>Was he good with girls?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>I remember what he told me, he says, you&rsquo;ve got to understand one thing, they&rsquo;re looking</p>
<p>for guys too.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>Oh, girls are looking for guys too?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a competitive game.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that little flame of love that we talked about and all the shapes that it takes in</p>
<p>our life, did he talk to you about that, that that could be taken advantage of, that that</p>
<p>could be used or was it implied?</p>
<p>Yeah, but not in, it was not very focused, not in great detail.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s, so we talked about personal stuff and you know, like, dislikes, he gave me tasks.</p>
<p>For instance, when my friend and I hitchhiked from East Germany all the way down to Bulgaria,</p>
<p>he told me to write a report about it, what I saw.</p>
<p>So fundamentally he wanted to see how well I can write and how well I can report, how</p>
<p>well I observe.</p>
<p>He also asked me to write some profiles about fellow students.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that was for them to give him to the Stasi, it was just like, how well</p>
<p>do I characterize people?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s important when you&rsquo;re talking about, when I was in the US, active in the US I operated</p>
<p>as a spotter.</p>
<p>So I did exactly that.</p>
<p>I wrote profiles about people.</p>
<p>He also gave me some tasks to do that were rather unpleasant.</p>
<p>He would give me an address and a name of the people who lived at the address and he</p>
<p>told me to go there, ring the doorbell and find out something about a relative who lived</p>
<p>in West Germany.</p>
<p>That is undercover exploration, right?</p>
<p>So you go, you make up a story and somehow win the confidence of your target to tell</p>
<p>you something that you want to know.</p>
<p>Was that, did that come naturally to you?</p>
<p>No, no, I hated it.</p>
<p>The charisma involved, which part did you hate?</p>
<p>Charisma, I think, I didn&rsquo;t know that I had it.</p>
<p>It took you some time to discover.</p>
<p>You know, I was, I always was and I still am to some degree a bit shy.</p>
<p>I lost a lot of the shyness after moving to the South because, here in the United States,</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have to be shy, you know.</p>
<p>You can let your love shine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>So, but anyway, I hated doing that, but I did it well.</p>
<p>I still remember.</p>
<p>So I, in those days, I had a beard and I rang the bell and&hellip;</p>
<p>Tall, handsome fella.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I looked the part, I said, I&rsquo;m a sociology student and I&rsquo;m doing a survey and I asked</p>
<p>a whole bunch of questions, would you like to answer the questions?</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>And then I directed the conversation to the lady&rsquo;s private life and she actually gave</p>
<p>me information.</p>
<p>She volunteered information that I wanted to know.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>I did well.</p>
<p>And the other one that I didn&rsquo;t like, but I also did well with, when Herman drove me</p>
<p>around the city and showed me a building and he said, find out what organization is in</p>
<p>there, what they do.</p>
<p>We get to know some people and I did that pretty well also.</p>
<p>You know, you have to be inventive, you know, to come up with a cover story and I&rsquo;ve always</p>
<p>been quite inventive, you know, I&rsquo;m a storyteller at heart and that, I didn&rsquo;t know it then,</p>
<p>but you know, I&hellip;</p>
<p>But there was still something unpleasant about it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Which part was unpleasant?</p>
<p>Well, the shyness and then, you know, I wasn&rsquo;t very comfortable lying.</p>
<p>I became comfortable down the road, but you know, I was brutally honest and never hid</p>
<p>anything of me.</p>
<p>But you know, over time you lose that uncomfortable feeling and you rationalize that you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>to do it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only one way, right?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re serving a good cause.</p>
<p>So you were talking to Herman for a year and a half?</p>
<p>A year and a half.</p>
<p>And then how did that progress?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So he finally, I guess he sent a report to headquarters in Berlin and then he sent me</p>
<p>on a three week, quote unquote, practice trip to Berlin.</p>
<p>This was the first time when I had like a conspiratorial meeting where I had an address</p>
<p>and a time and a code phrase and I met another agent.</p>
<p>His name was Boris.</p>
<p>These names were meaningless.</p>
<p>They were all like cover names, right?</p>
<p>So what was the code and the meaning?</p>
<p>What was then?</p>
<p>Can you give a little more detail?</p>
<p>That code I don&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>Not the code, but like, what do you mean by code?</p>
<p>So what was&hellip;</p>
<p>I tell you, the code we used when I met while I was active, I would approach the other person</p>
<p>who I thought may be the person I want to meet.</p>
<p>We both had something with us or on us to make us more likely to be the right person.</p>
<p>And I would ask him the following questions, excuse me, I&rsquo;m looking for Susan Green.</p>
<p>And he would answer, yes, you must be David.</p>
<p>Stupid.</p>
<p>If I ask a stranger, they would look at me, well, how could I help you?</p>
<p>So I know it&rsquo;s the wrong guy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a low probability that the right thing would be said, so it&rsquo;s a nice entry.</p>
<p>And it seems like a safe statement if it&rsquo;s not the right person, it would just come off</p>
<p>absurd or crazy or whatever.</p>
<p>You would have made a good secret agent.</p>
<p>You know exactly&hellip;</p>
<p>How do you know I&rsquo;m not?</p>
<p>This is&hellip;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll discuss this further.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m dressed like one.</p>
<p>Actually, yeah, were there any dress code?</p>
<p>No, just fit in.</p>
<p>Fit in.</p>
<p>No matter what.</p>
<p>And then be creative.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Figure out ways to fit.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So anyways, he gave me some tasks and since I had rented a room in a house, he gave me</p>
<p>Western literature to read and we spent time together and there was a practice run to West</p>
<p>Germany.</p>
<p>Actually, there were two and that was very important.</p>
<p>In hindsight, I figured that out.</p>
<p>So I traveled to West Germany, no, not to West Berlin, with an East German passport</p>
<p>that was stamped that that individual was allowed to go to the West.</p>
<p>And there was a part of the border that was only guarded by Soviet troops and that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>they smuggled me into West Germany.</p>
<p>I got on the subway and then appeared in West Berlin.</p>
<p>No Americans, no Brits, no French knew that I had entered.</p>
<p>Irish documents?</p>
<p>No, no, this was an East German passport.</p>
<p>It was real.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So and the first trip, all they wanted me to do is just walk around, smell the air,</p>
<p>have a beer or whatever and eat a sausage and then come back.</p>
<p>The second trip, I had a task very similar to the one that I had back in Jena to ring</p>
<p>the doorbell someplace and talk to some people and that worked very well also.</p>
<p>I should mention that you talk about that, you know, eat a sausage, drink some beer.</p>
<p>I suppose that&rsquo;s a good test too to see how you behave under Western, like when first</p>
<p>introduced to the Western culture.</p>
<p>Like this is why I might not make a good agent is when I first came to the United States</p>
<p>in the supermarket, like bananas, as many bananas as I want to eat.</p>
<p>That I think that would break me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shock.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shock to have access to Western culture.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting very close to the reason they actually made me do these two practice trips.</p>
<p>When I first emerged on West Berlin territory, I felt highly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>That was at the enemy, right?</p>
<p>And I saw the cops everywhere and even though those cops had like light blue uniforms, nothing,</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t standouts.</p>
<p>So I was wondering, you know, if they knew that, you know, I had like KGB on my forehead.</p>
<p>So you were paranoid that they would know, they would see.</p>
<p>I was scared, but I overcame that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, can we just linger on that because I suppose that&rsquo;s a natural, like if I give</p>
<p>anybody on the street the mission to do the mission you had to do is they would be paranoid.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a natural human feeling is am I being watched?</p>
<p>Do they know?</p>
<p>Like if you try to steal something from a store, there&rsquo;s going to be a feeling like,</p>
<p>are they watching me?</p>
<p>Are the cameras watching?</p>
<p>Are the people watching me?</p>
<p>They all know that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So you have to over, or you have to be somehow rugged and robust to that kind of feeling</p>
<p>and overcome it.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>So and something very interesting happened while I was being trained in Berlin, I met</p>
<p>a classmate of mine from high school and he confided to me that he was recruited by the</p>
<p>Stasi to become a spy, go as a spy to West Germany.</p>
<p>And he also had this practice trip and he peed in his pants.</p>
<p>He went back and told him, I can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Just from the terror, that paranoia.</p>
<p>Now this guy&rsquo;s career was over.</p>
<p>He had an engineering degree, he was a pretty smart guy, he was just for the rest of his</p>
<p>life and he&rsquo;s still alive I believe, floating around and trading in model railroads and</p>
<p>stuff like that.</p>
<p>You mean do you think that experience broke him?</p>
<p>They wouldn&rsquo;t let him back in.</p>
<p>Oh, I see.</p>
<p>They, oh.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So this is a test that if you fail, you pay the price.</p>
<p>I had no idea that, you know, something bad would happen if I failed that test, but I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t fail.</p>
<p>So, and this led then to the offer, all right, and after, you know, Boris was happy with</p>
<p>me and he told his boss who was most likely the head of the KGB in East Berlin and I had</p>
<p>an appointment to meet.</p>
<p>In East Germany.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>In East Germany.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All of East Germany.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>An appointment to meet with him and as we walk into the room, there was this huge desk</p>
<p>and a little guy sitting behind it, very, very, just like little and unimpressive, right?</p>
<p>A lot of paraphernalia, like, you know, had a bust of Dzerzhinsky on his desk and some</p>
<p>paintings of Lenin and so forth, but when the guy opened his mouth, he went like, whoa.</p>
<p>Huge psychological energy.</p>
<p>He spoke only Russian now and initially, he would, you know, start the bet with five minutes</p>
<p>worth of propaganda, why we&rsquo;re doing what we&rsquo;re doing, I didn&rsquo;t need that, I understood</p>
<p>most of it, but when I didn&rsquo;t understand, I&rsquo;d ask Boris to translate and then he sprung</p>
<p>it on me and I was not prepared.</p>
<p>He said, so what, are you in or not?</p>
<p>And I was, no, I hadn&rsquo;t made up my mind.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t expecting that would come and so I said to him, I&rsquo;m not really trained, you</p>
<p>know, there&rsquo;s a lot of things I need to learn and I came up with a couple of really stupid</p>
<p>things, one not so stupid, but the other one was, I don&rsquo;t know why I said that, I said,</p>
<p>for instance, I need to learn how to drive a car and to type with a typewriter and he</p>
<p>got really annoyed and he said, don&rsquo;t worry about it, we&rsquo;ll train you.</p>
<p>But I got to tell you, we need people who are decisive.</p>
<p>So you got until tomorrow noon to give Boris your decision.</p>
<p>That made for a sleepless night.</p>
<p>So what was going through your mind?</p>
<p>Well I had, this was almost 50, 50, I knew I was going to have a huge career, a good</p>
<p>career.</p>
<p>It was on my way because I was already employed by the university as an assistant professor.</p>
<p>So that career would be to become a professor, become a 10 year professor, be a world class.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Jena had become my hometown.</p>
<p>I really loved the place.</p>
<p>It was my oyster and my family was my basketball team.</p>
<p>You love playing basketball.</p>
<p>Oh absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So this is home.</p>
<p>This is home.</p>
<p>This is where your love is.</p>
<p>This was home.</p>
<p>Did you understand that the choice involved leaving the home behind?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And the one thing I didn&rsquo;t have, the two things I didn&rsquo;t have, an emotional relationship</p>
<p>with my mother and I didn&rsquo;t have a steady girlfriend at the time.</p>
<p>I think Freud would have a lot to say about that, but yeah, go ahead.</p>
<p>But the connection between those two, but yeah, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>By the way, my friend G√ºnther, the one who worked for the Stasi, was also, the Stasi</p>
<p>tried to recruit him as an agent, but he had a love relationship at the time and he said</p>
<p>politely, no, I won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So you didn&rsquo;t have, that&rsquo;s the one thing that really could have held you to this place</p>
<p>is love.</p>
<p>So you got the career on the one hand, my basketball team, the town that I would be</p>
<p>part of the ruling elite of, and then we had this great adventure and the ability to contribute</p>
<p>to the victory, the worldwide victory of communism and stick it to the Nazis and of course the</p>
<p>feeling that you&rsquo;re really special.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>James Bond.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s, the question, do I want to be a tenured professor or James Bond?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And as funny as that sounds, that was probably a difficult decision.</p>
<p>It was a difficult decision, but fundamentally it wasn&rsquo;t, and it wasn&rsquo;t my zeal to help the</p>
<p>revolution.</p>
<p>It was my, what they called, what the Stasi was looking for, the KGB was looking for in</p>
<p>a character that they would send over a well controlled inclination to adventure.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>James Bond.</p>
<p>What do you say?</p>
<p>In the love of women.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was, yes, I got to put this in right here because I&rsquo;m telling people I have two things</p>
<p>in common with James Bond.</p>
<p>These are my initials, JB, and I got the girl too, three times.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean that&rsquo;s, and that&rsquo;s adventure.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the ability to travel to the West because the West was closed off to us, we could go</p>
<p>to foreign countries, but they all had to be communist countries.</p>
<p>You know, I wanted to see Paris because I had fallen in love with the Honore Balzac</p>
<p>who wrote a phenomenal set of novels that I just ate up.</p>
<p>And so when I eventually did go to Paris, I knew all the places already because he described</p>
<p>them all.</p>
<p>Okay, so that one, it was a, it was 5149, but eventually it, and you know, when you,</p>
<p>when you do the side by side intellectual comparison, that doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>It becomes a tie.</p>
<p>And then, you know, you just go with your gut and I said, Hey, I&rsquo;m in.</p>
<p>So now that you successfully passed the test and you were sitting with this unimpressive</p>
<p>man and had the invite and had to sleep on it and have made the decision to join.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What was next?</p>
<p>I was just told, you know, that I was being recruited by the state department of East</p>
<p>Germany.</p>
<p>I was going to become a diplomat.</p>
<p>I must have had some paper, but I forgot because just by saying so, then that would, that wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have worked.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some kind of document that says that, and that was the only entanglement you had</p>
<p>to that, to that place.</p>
<p>No love.</p>
<p>No basketball, basketball, giving up basketball was huge for me.</p>
<p>I love playing that game.</p>
<p>I started playing basketball when I was 18.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a little late.</p>
<p>Are you better offensive, defensive?</p>
<p>What do you like more?</p>
<p>Do you like to shoot from a distance?</p>
<p>Do you like, I was a runner.</p>
<p>I was very, very quick on my feet and I was a good jumper too.</p>
<p>I typically played the, uh, the, the four position, you know, what&rsquo;s that, uh, forward</p>
<p>or the forward position, forward position.</p>
<p>But anyway, um, so that, that, that was the hardest, uh, uh, for me to give up.</p>
<p>Um, but indeed the other thing that I remember I had to do to hand in my party document to</p>
<p>the party secretary of the university.</p>
<p>And uh, he made a comment.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We probably won&rsquo;t hear much about you, but, uh, we know that you&rsquo;re going to do something</p>
<p>very important.</p>
<p>So he sort of had an inkling that, uh, I&rsquo;m going, I&rsquo;m going to go someplace, uh, undercover</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>And then I packed my bags and got on a train, uh, to Berlin for another one of those secret</p>
<p>meetings with, uh, my, my new handler, Nikolai.</p>
<p>So and here, here came another test that, that would have been quite easy to fail.</p>
<p>So I, I had lived, uh, in Yena for six years in a dorm, even when I became a, an employee</p>
<p>of the university, they didn&rsquo;t, they didn&rsquo;t have apartments.</p>
<p>I was still living in a dorm and, and they won in a single room with a bed, a chair and</p>
<p>a table and a toilet down the, down the hallway.</p>
<p>So I figured, you know, Berlin KGB, I&rsquo;m going to get a nice apartment, right?</p>
<p>And so, uh, uh, Nikolai took me into his car.</p>
<p>We started talking a little bit and then he said, I have a task for you already.</p>
<p>Your first task is to find yourself a place to live.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t think I showed it in my face, but you know, my heart, my, my, my, my heart</p>
<p>dropped like down to into my pants.</p>
<p>I, I knew this was nearly impossible because it was a severe shortage of, uh, of housing</p>
<p>and in, in, in everywhere in Germany, East Germany and all the apartments and homes were</p>
<p>controlled by, by the government.</p>
<p>You know, there were long waiting lists.</p>
<p>Uh, I know, I knew couples that, uh, were promised maybe to get an apartment, uh, five</p>
<p>years down the road.</p>
<p>So then they would postpone the decision to have a child.</p>
<p>Anyway, this was impossible.</p>
<p>Uh, well, yeah, but this was a test, you know, because I had to be inventive.</p>
<p>Now I had to figure out, uh, how to get out of an impossible situation.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize it then at all.</p>
<p>I just went with the flow, you know, what do I do?</p>
<p>So what I did, I went, I took the train, the city train, uh, to the very last stop, a little</p>
<p>town called Ackner.</p>
<p>And I wandered around in that town and knocked on doors and asked people if they knew where</p>
<p>somebody might have a place to live.</p>
<p>And after a couple of hours, somebody said, there&rsquo;s this lady that, and she gave, and</p>
<p>they gave me the address and I talked to the lady and she said, I happen to have a place</p>
<p>that you might, uh, that where you might be able to stay.</p>
<p>It was an outbuilding.</p>
<p>Uh, I don&rsquo;t know what it was, what it served.</p>
<p>It was not a garage.</p>
<p>It was concrete.</p>
<p>And it had, um, a bed and a chair, uh, running cold water and a stove, a cold stove.</p>
<p>That was my, was going to be my&hellip;</p>
<p>Pretty basic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your&hellip;</p>
<p>Pretty basic?</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the, uh&hellip;</p>
<p>Toilet across the yard, of course.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, all the essentials.</p>
<p>What are you complaining about?</p>
<p>So you were, you had to run the, uh, the special, James Bond had to run a special operation</p>
<p>out of the house.</p>
<p>To, to, to my credit, and I think that, that, uh, that established part of my reputation.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t complain at all to Nikolai.</p>
<p>That was part of the test probably.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I just told him, you know, I found something.</p>
<p>And so, uh, for six months I would get up in the morning, get on the train and walk</p>
<p>around in the city, you know, uh, did some operational stuff, uh, operational training.</p>
<p>I went to the library, did a lot of reading in the library.</p>
<p>And then I found a basketball team that I could join.</p>
<p>So at least I could take a shower twice a week.</p>
<p>Um, and, uh, and apparently it took about six months that I was still on probation because</p>
<p>after six months, Nikolai, one day we were still meeting in his car, he said, he handed</p>
<p>me a key and he said, I&rsquo;m going to take you to your new apartment.</p>
<p>Now I, and I didn&rsquo;t know this, you know, that now I was really in.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Imagine the hurdles you have to jump over and how many times you can fail, but you know.</p>
<p>But not complaining, not asking questions.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I mean, that was something you&rsquo;ve written about.</p>
<p>Um, I think you wrote that bosses do not like to hear complaints or problems.</p>
<p>They prefer solutions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So what was your interaction like with the bosses?</p>
<p>Is that essentially, um, represents the way he went forward as well?</p>
<p>I, no complaints, no arguments, no, no, I know this better.</p>
<p>I was taking it all in now that the, the, the technical guys, you know, they taught</p>
<p>me something I didn&rsquo;t know that made sense.</p>
<p>Um, what Nikolai, some of the stuff that he taught me was somewhat questionable.</p>
<p>He was a generalist and there&rsquo;s some things he didn&rsquo;t know really well.</p>
<p>So I could have like asked, probed a little bit, but I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So I just played along.</p>
<p>So this new apartment was, uh, uh, it was a studio at, at, at, at a kitchen with running</p>
<p>cold water and the bathroom was just one flight down the toilet, not a bathroom, uh, one flight</p>
<p>down the stairs, uh, it was a big upgrade.</p>
<p>And he gave me, uh, I think he gave me a thousand mark to buy, buy furniture.</p>
<p>And in that place, I actually, I also bought a TV and started watching West German television.</p>
<p>So I finally had a decent place to stay.</p>
<p>Um, and the, the, my training in Berlin took about two years.</p>
<p>What was the training?</p>
<p>What were the interesting aspects to the training?</p>
<p>What were sort of, if you do an overview systematic of what was the training process, what was</p>
<p>difficult, what are some insights that generalize to the training process of what it takes to</p>
<p>be a KGB spy?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So, uh, let me start with the trade craft.</p>
<p>So I was taught Morse code that took a while, uh, I, I, I was, uh, instructed in how to,</p>
<p>you know, use a shortwave radio and to receive, uh, the, the shortwave, uh, transmissions</p>
<p>with Morse code.</p>
<p>I was taught, uh, uh, and a encryption and decryption algorithm, manual algorithm, you,</p>
<p>you might be interested that eventually I figured out, uh, at least one of the patterns,</p>
<p>uh, the, the algorithm was such that the, and this was all about digits, like, uh, and</p>
<p>the algorithm was such that in the end, the, uh, the digits that were used to decipher</p>
<p>other digits that were handed, uh, that were sent to me by a shortwave radio, there were,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say if there were a hundred digits, there were an equal number of ones, twos,</p>
<p>threes, fours, fives, six, and seven, and up until zero.</p>
<p>And I was told that, uh, these, um, uh, algorithms, these manual algorithms were, were good for</p>
<p>about 300 uses.</p>
<p>After that, they could still be deciphered.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming nowadays that, uh, wouldn&rsquo;t take as much.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>With, with computers for sure.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s probably, they&rsquo;re probably designed in a way that you can manually sort of, uh,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s efficient and convenient to use them manually, it&rsquo;s not to optimize cryptographic</p>
<p>security, it&rsquo;s to optimize, it&rsquo;s like to balance security and like humans being able to actually.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I got to disagree.</p>
<p>It was neither efficient nor convenient.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It took a long time.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t decipherable.</p>
<p>When, what was, what was significantly easier to do, uh, but, uh, that would require you</p>
<p>to have spied paraphernalia with you.</p>
<p>This is what&rsquo;s called a one time pad.</p>
<p>So you have the set of numbers on, on a sheet of paper, uh, that had to be developed.</p>
<p>I had to use iodine to make those numbers visible.</p>
<p>Those are known to be unbreakable unless they are used multiple times, the same, the same</p>
<p>sheet of paper, because, you know, the person who encrypts has the same set of numbers as</p>
<p>the person who decrypts and one, one time use, you cannot figure out what the message</p>
<p>is.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>But this is a quick way to communicate from one person to another one time, one time.</p>
<p>One time, but I had a pad with multiple, uh, sheets of paper, right?</p>
<p>And, uh, the reason that they gave me a manual one is because I literally, I had only when</p>
<p>I, when I wound up in the United States, I had only one thing with me that, uh, only</p>
<p>a spy can have.</p>
<p>And that was a, uh, a writing pad with, uh, uh, where the first 10 pages or so were impregnated</p>
<p>with a trace of a chemical that was used for secret writing.</p>
<p>Uh, but you really would have to know what you&rsquo;re looking for to, you know, you see this</p>
<p>pad it was bought at, uh, you know, Walmart and.</p>
<p>Can you explain a little, a little further?</p>
<p>What is the chemical here that, what are we talking about?</p>
<p>So how, I don&rsquo;t understand how it&rsquo;s possible to have a physical pad that does the encryption</p>
<p>without any computing.</p>
<p>How does it encode?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So, so no, no, it doesn&rsquo;t, it doesn&rsquo;t do any work, you know, so, and the, uh, the communication</p>
<p>that the encrypted communication was, uh, was, uh, a set of, uh, uh, groups of five,</p>
<p>five digits and then another five and there&rsquo;s always a gap in between, um, and, uh, so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say if I get this radio transmission, I write them all down and then I, then I use my, uh,</p>
<p>develop my algorithm and then I do mathematics, either addition or subtraction.</p>
<p>The resulting set of digits had then had a one to one correlation to letters.</p>
<p>And this is an easy way to then do the correlation.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying the algorithm was not efficient.</p>
<p>It was not.</p>
<p>Oh, the manual took a long time and, and you can&rsquo;t make an error.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Uh, would you know where, can you, is it easy to debug?</p>
<p>No, no, you do it twice.</p>
<p>You do it twice and that&rsquo;s how you check.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s identical, then you know, but like, if it&rsquo;s not, then one is right and the other</p>
<p>is wrong.</p>
<p>You gotta do it again.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t make mistakes.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And I really didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So I was, I was learning that, uh, I was also, uh, told that I was required to become proficient</p>
<p>in another language and they gave me a choice and I picked English.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what was the other one.</p>
<p>Oh no, pick one friend, you know, whatever is spoken in the West.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Uh, what was, what was, what would be second to you?</p>
<p>Would you, would you think French because of Paris?</p>
<p>What would you, what, why English?</p>
<p>English was a no brainer because I, I was a straight age to a student in English without</p>
<p>studying.</p>
<p>I like it came so easily to me.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I chose it, right?</p>
<p>So that was that, uh, then, uh, um, I, uh, I w I was taught the basics of, um, uh, counter</p>
<p>surveillance, you know, some trickery and, and, and, uh, um, uh, surveillance detection</p>
<p>routes where you wander around in the city for three hours and determine whether you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>being followed or not.</p>
<p>That requires you to plan the route very well.</p>
<p>I give you one example that, uh, that will illustrate that as my, my favorite spot.</p>
<p>When, when, when I was in Moscow, I did a lot of that also.</p>
<p>And if my favorite spot was, I wasn&rsquo;t a not well traveled, uh, uh, road.</p>
<p>It went down the hill and, and curved.</p>
<p>And at the bottom of the hill, there was a telephone booth.</p>
<p>And when you open the door and pick up the telephone, you have to look back.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t like this, right?</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a giveaway.</p>
<p>This was normal.</p>
<p>That was natural.</p>
<p>So I could see if somebody would come walking after me, you know, these kinds of things.</p>
<p>Or you would, uh, uh, you know, use, um, public transportation, uh, big buildings, uh, where</p>
<p>you needed to use an elevator and see who&rsquo;s because surveillance, the, the object of</p>
<p>surveillance is to never lose sight of the individual who you&rsquo;re surveilling because</p>
<p>at that point you may miss the window where he does something that you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>So somebody always has to come close, right?</p>
<p>Did you have to also study surveillance?</p>
<p>No, only counter surveillance.</p>
<p>And what helped me in, in, in all my training, uh, you know, I, I would be, uh, would have</p>
<p>a competition with, uh, uh, folks that were coming, they were following me and me.</p>
<p>And I beat them every time, uh, they were at a disadvantage because one of them always</p>
<p>had to be close and, and if you saw the same face twice, you know that you were being followed.</p>
<p>And I had a very, very good, uh, memory for, for faces.</p>
<p>So basically figure out a fixed route and then a fixed route that allows you to, uh,</p>
<p>survey the area and then record the faces you&rsquo;ve seen inside your mind.</p>
<p>And if, uh, you see multiple times a single face, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s a bad sign.</p>
<p>And then they could, they could, uh, you use, uh, different clothes, uh, but they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have was face masks.</p>
<p>The CIA does nowadays.</p>
<p>They can give you a different face within seconds.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So how big, I mean, again, you talk about paranoia, um, is that part of the, is that</p>
<p>a big part of the job, uh, counter surveillance, like being constantly paranoid that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>being watched?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was supposed to.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that quite stressful.</p>
<p>So is that, is that one of the, is that actually an effective way to operate?</p>
<p>Uh, nobody, it sort of becomes a routine.</p>
<p>Uh, I was told to do it, uh, while in the U S once a month and, uh, okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a cleaning out.</p>
<p>Oh, not, not every day.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Once a month or before I would say, mail a letter with secret writing.</p>
<p>So I was sure that, you know, nobody saw me put an envelope into a postbox.</p>
<p>So this is one of the tools in your toolbox is Morse code.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the decryption and encryption.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the car surveillance, photography, um, making, making microdots, you know, what</p>
<p>a microdot is?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a microdot?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, uh, you use, you, you take a photograph and you use a microscope in reverse and, uh,</p>
<p>make that photograph really small, so small that it&rsquo;s like the head of a pin that can</p>
<p>be used to, uh, hide under a postage stamp.</p>
<p>Uh, in reality, I knew how to make them, but in reality, they, they never asked me to make</p>
<p>use of that technique.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a sort of an encryption mechanism for photographs.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So what we do nowadays, embed, uh, code in, in, uh, PDFs and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So that, that was a learning, a training process, both in the physical space and sort</p>
<p>of, um, algorithmically.</p>
<p>Is there other things?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You bet.</p>
<p>Uh, interestingly enough, the, uh, I was, um, the first book I was given to read was</p>
<p>the history of this, uh, these, uh, communist party of the Soviet union.</p>
<p>Oh, so understand.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Cause you said you had to read Western literature.</p>
<p>Yeah, that too.</p>
<p>How much, how much reading, so history, how much history of politics, geopolitics, culture.</p>
<p>Not much more, but they made me read that document.</p>
<p>Other than that, I wasn&rsquo;t supposed to study the Soviet union.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t supposed and that was not, and I didn&rsquo;t, when they sent me to Moscow, it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>to learn Russia, Russian, right?</p>
<p>It was to learn English.</p>
<p>Um, the, the second document they gave me was the, the constitution of West Germany.</p>
<p>And then I got lots of magazines and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Uh, as I told you, I was, uh, also told to, uh, uh, watch West German television, which</p>
<p>I, which I, uh, embraced with a vengeance because it was better than East German.</p>
<p>So I would get up in the morning and have a little breakfast and watch the German version</p>
<p>of Sesame street.</p>
<p>And that, that, that helps you, uh, that helps you get an understanding of the culture.</p>
<p>You have to do any kind of, uh, interaction, kind of spying that you have to be, be able</p>
<p>to effectively integrate.</p>
<p>Well, you, you also have to know, like, and, and that would have been easier, uh, if I,</p>
<p>they had sent me to West Germany, you know, all the soccer teams, you know, stuff that</p>
<p>everybody knows when I came to the U S I knew very little stuff that everybody knows.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I had to be very cautious and, you know, take it in all the time anyway.</p>
<p>Uh, and the, the last thing I want to mention is, uh, they, uh, I was strongly encouraged</p>
<p>to, uh, expand my, my cultural education.</p>
<p>In other words, go to visit museums, uh, go to the theater, uh, not so much movies, uh,</p>
<p>opera, read, read books from all kinds of authors.</p>
<p>Uh, that was important to them.</p>
<p>And once a month I had to write a report what I did, but the interesting thing, there was</p>
<p>not a, there was no curriculum, there was no agenda, there were no check marks.</p>
<p>It was all ad hoc.</p>
<p>You know, now you do this and then you do that.</p>
<p>Uh, and, uh, and a lot of this also, they relied on my initiative.</p>
<p>Again,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s part of the evaluation too.</p>
<p>You bet.</p>
<p>Um, are you able to have creative, it&rsquo;s interesting that they&rsquo;re like developing a James Bond</p>
<p>type of character here, which is what, what&rsquo;s the reason to go to the opera as you become</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>In a certain kind of way where perhaps that makes you, uh, more charming, more charismatic</p>
<p>in terms of your ability to integrate yourself in different situations.</p>
<p>You absolutely right.</p>
<p>Uh, uh, I, I was, I was, um, uh, uh, when I came to the US after about, uh, two years</p>
<p>roughly, um, I was cultured enough to, uh, not, uh, make a bad impression at a, at a</p>
<p>diplomatic soiree in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>I mingled freely.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>And, and, and so the whole idea was for me to sort of reach into the upper, uh, realms</p>
<p>of society where the targets would be juicier than, you know, the worker bees.</p>
<p>And how did you end up in Moscow?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What is that journey?</p>
<p>Well, so I, uh, I told you, and I started studying English, so I started back from scratch,</p>
<p>you know, they paid for a tutor and I went from like English 101 and then I went through</p>
<p>that in a couple of months then.</p>
<p>And then I got another guy with whom we, I expanded this.</p>
<p>We had conversations rather than working from a textbook and I, and I worked like a maniac.</p>
<p>I threw myself into the study of, of, of, uh, uh, English.</p>
<p>Like you wouldn&rsquo;t believe.</p>
<p>Um, and, and my inspiration came from Vladimir Lenin.</p>
<p>I had read somewhere in a book that when Lenin was in exile, he studied German and he learned</p>
<p>100 German words every day, new German words.</p>
<p>So I started reading newspapers and every word that I didn&rsquo;t know, I wrote down on an</p>
<p>index card, uh, German, English, and, uh, and I piled them up.</p>
<p>And so I really learned 100 new English words every day.</p>
<p>I know this because I counted them and I had a system how to do this.</p>
<p>Uh, uh, so you take your index card and you have five categories is a really good way</p>
<p>to learn wrote by wrote.</p>
<p>Uh, so you&rsquo;ve got category one, that&rsquo;s the new ones and you&rsquo;ve got category five.</p>
<p>So you start with, uh, with five, five, you already had right four times.</p>
<p>If you have it right again, it goes to the archive.</p>
<p>Oh, in like longterm cold archive.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Four.</p>
<p>If you get it right, it goes to five.</p>
<p>If you get it wrong, it gets relegated to three or so.</p>
<p>And so you go through this and, uh, um, and occasionally I would throw the archive things</p>
<p>back into one.</p>
<p>So I really, I really acquired a phenomenal vocabulary.</p>
<p>When I was done with my English, my vocabulary was significantly higher than the average</p>
<p>American because I, I, I didn&rsquo;t discriminate whatever word I didn&rsquo;t know I learned, which</p>
<p>is not necessarily the best way because you know, English has a lot of synonyms, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And one synonym is usually the, the preferable one and, and I, um, when I first interacted</p>
<p>with people, I very often used the one that wasn&rsquo;t as good.</p>
<p>And people have found that I, you know, I have an interesting way of talking.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t know what that meant, but yeah.</p>
<p>So it builds a good foundation for a language is getting a large vocabulary.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something I do, which is called space repetition, which is a programmatic way of</p>
<p>doing this kind of system that you&rsquo;ve developed yourself, which is if you successfully remember</p>
<p>a thing, it&rsquo;s going to be a longer time before it brings it up to you again.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s requires a computer to keep track of information.</p>
<p>If you have cars, that&rsquo;s a really interesting pile system.</p>
<p>One, two, three, four, five, you upgrade it one, two, three, four, five.</p>
<p>Maybe I wouldn&rsquo;t go to the archive and go to them to, to pile one right away.</p>
<p>I would go to like, I don&rsquo;t know, pile five, perhaps is probably the right place to put</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Cause, cause you have to go through that full step again, but that is a really powerful</p>
<p>way to learn definitely language, but also facts.</p>
<p>Like people that go to medical school.</p>
<p>Disconnected facts.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And, and you pretty much, when you&rsquo;re done, you, you know what you know.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>Then again, to use it, to integrate it into the music of language.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more difficult.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a charm.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe it&rsquo;s not good for Spycraft, but there&rsquo;s a charm to this kind of, to having</p>
<p>an accent and using words incorrectly, but confidently there&rsquo;s a, because language isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>a simple formula.</p>
<p>Language is the play of words.</p>
<p>So actually using the incorrect synonym, you know, as it, you know, if, instead of saying</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m cold saying I&rsquo;m chilled or something.</p>
<p>Like using off beat words can actually be part of the charm.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting if you can learn how to use that correctly.</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;ve known a bunch of people with the Russian accent and I feel like they get, get</p>
<p>away with saying a lot of ridiculous shit because they&rsquo;re able to sort of leverage the</p>
<p>charm of the non sequiturs.</p>
<p>And by the way, by the way, just one, one thing that we talked about using a computer.</p>
<p>When I had my first personal computer, I actually wrote a program that does that.</p>
<p>It does that.</p>
<p>By the way, when was that?</p>
<p>When, cause you were a world class programmer for a time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You were a very good programmer.</p>
<p>When, when did the birth?</p>
<p>First PC was probably 1984.</p>
<p>1984.</p>
<p>When did you fall in love with programming?</p>
<p>When I went to college in the US and part of the core curriculum was that you were required</p>
<p>to take a course in computer and it was mostly just, you know, talk, but we also had to learn</p>
<p>a language.</p>
<p>Uh, we had to write some programs and Fortran, which was what five at the time, it was a,</p>
<p>it was a dumbed down Fortran, but listen, so I, I see the ability, I see what, what</p>
<p>you can do with this, I programmed a sine curve and then I divided the, the sine curve</p>
<p>into really, really small rectangles and then ran the program and it came up with the right</p>
<p>area.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so powerful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, uh, you&rsquo;re creating, you&rsquo;re creating a little helper helps you understand the world</p>
<p>to help you analyze the world and so on.</p>
<p>Uh, we&rsquo;ll, we&rsquo;ll return to that cause it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So you have so many interesting aspects to your life, but Moscow.</p>
<p>So</p>
<p>Yeah, no, let me, let, no, let me, how I was sent to Moscow.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So one day I had a visitor from Moscow, uh, and he came to visit me in my apartment, uh,</p>
<p>together with, uh, Nikolai and he, you know, we talked and then he said, how&rsquo;s your English?</p>
<p>I said, I pulled a book from the shelf and says, I can read that without the help of</p>
<p>a dictionary.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>And he said, you know what, we&rsquo;re going to send you a tape recorder and you just talk,</p>
<p>say something, you know, for 20 minutes, whatever you want to talk about.</p>
<p>Uh, they sent this thing and two weeks later I was on a plane to Moscow because I also</p>
<p>spoke English, sort of the British variety of English with not a strong German accent</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve always had the ability to imitate others and sounds that was an innate ability.</p>
<p>I would, uh, you know, when, when, when we were in a lab and, uh, as students, I would</p>
<p>very often do, uh, monologues, uh, imitating East German comedians.</p>
<p>You know, I just, yes, yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not good enough to make a living out of it, but, uh, that raised some interest.</p>
<p>And so when they sent me to Moscow, that was the first time on a plane, by the way, um,</p>
<p>and, uh, I had a conversation with two ladies who spoke English.</p>
<p>One was a, a Russian, a professor at, uh, Lomonosov University.</p>
<p>She was obviously KGB, that was her cover.</p>
<p>And the other one was an American born lady.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, she was an actual professor and using that as the cover or is it just</p>
<p>a story?</p>
<p>No, I, she said she was a professor.</p>
<p>She may have taught there too.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting distinction.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>One is like a story you tell people and one is like you legit are doing the thing, but</p>
<p>are also as a cover.</p>
<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s an interesting aspect of how to be a good liar.</p>
<p>You might, you might as well live the lie.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly right.</p>
<p>Uh, so, uh, and the other one was a middle aged, the, the Russian was pretty young.</p>
<p>The other one was middle aged and American and, uh, and so we talked for maybe a couple</p>
<p>of hours and then they withdrew and I was left alone.</p>
<p>Eventually my liaison, he came back in and he said, it was close, but the American thinks</p>
<p>you can actually, uh, become, uh, you get close enough to become, becoming a native</p>
<p>speaker of American English.</p>
<p>And he said, the Russian was very doubtful.</p>
<p>So I think wishful, it was, it was a tie, literally wishful thinking prevailed.</p>
<p>So, uh, within a couple of weeks I was moving to Moscow.</p>
<p>And what, what was the task in Moscow and what, how long were you in Moscow?</p>
<p>Two years.</p>
<p>And what was the task there?</p>
<p>Is it training or is it espionage?</p>
<p>No, it was training.</p>
<p>It was, uh, so it was, uh, I, uh, the, the American born became my tutor.</p>
<p>I met with her twice a week.</p>
<p>Uh, I, uh, I also listened to a lot of BBC, shortwave BBC worldwide, uh, I read, uh, more</p>
<p>English books.</p>
<p>So a lot of that was about the language and the culture of English, uh, American.</p>
<p>And, and I did phonetics exercises every night.</p>
<p>I had a tape that was about a half hour long and they would say a word and I would repeat</p>
<p>the word, say a word, repeat the word.</p>
<p>And it was mostly about the vowels, by the way, most of the accent and, uh, uh, particularly</p>
<p>because let&rsquo;s say coming from German into, into English, but also Russian.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the vowels.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about the, so you would have a single word, a word, apple, and you would</p>
<p>just say apple.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And American English or British English?</p>
<p>No, American English.</p>
<p>And, and I give you one, uh, example that almost nobody gets right.</p>
<p>The difference between hot and hut, you know, and in German speakers, it&rsquo;s very tough.</p>
<p>You know, which one, uh, for everyone is different.</p>
<p>For example, uh, I could say this on a podcast, something that my brother struggles with,</p>
<p>I struggled with too, when I first came to this country to learn English is there&rsquo;s differences.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s embarrassing differences, uh, like beach and bitch, right?</p>
<p>And you get so, as a young kid, also you get so nervous of, I don&rsquo;t want to say the wrong</p>
<p>thing.</p>
<p>I, um, I can also say that this is almost as a jokey thing, but, uh, there&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a famous philosopher, uh, Immanuel Kant, and you can, uh, guess which other word is very</p>
<p>similar to that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s a nervousness about the, what is that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, and Germans probably have a different, uh, tension of like what is hard to learn</p>
<p>the difference between the pronunciation of the vowels or the control of the vowels.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So you had to really master this daily exercise and, you know, and this, this was my discipline.</p>
<p>I did this every night, routine, boring as hell.</p>
<p>Uh, so English was the focus.</p>
<p>And I also had interaction with some, uh, agents who had operated in the United States</p>
<p>as diplomats on the, on the diplomatic cover.</p>
<p>They would come and talk to me a little bit and tell me and sort of prepare me what was</p>
<p>ahead of me.</p>
<p>And then I did a whole lot of operational training, particularly surveillance detection.</p>
<p>That was big.</p>
<p>They also, they also taught me how to drive a car in Moscow.</p>
<p>Finally, the one skill you needed.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a surveillance detection?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So this is what, when, when you find out whether you&rsquo;re being followed.</p>
<p>Ah, got it, got it, got it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the, yeah, got you.</p>
<p>The abbreviation that&rsquo;s used in, uh, in, in, in, uh, yes, uh, in, uh, intelligence circles</p>
<p>is SDR, surveillance detection route, you know, when they say that, you know what that</p>
<p>is.</p>
<p>Uh, and, and that was it.</p>
<p>Uh, and a, and a few other things, you know, one offs, for instance, uh, I was once, uh,</p>
<p>taught, uh, to read silhouettes of ships.</p>
<p>When you see a ship from a distance, what kind of a ship it might be.</p>
<p>They, they thought this would come in handy.</p>
<p>Actually they, they, uh, there was in, in 1982, Andropov, uh, started, uh, a campaign</p>
<p>that was, uh, now I forget the name, Operation something, something where everybody who was</p>
<p>in the West was supposed to, uh, look for science that, uh, the West was, uh, uh, getting</p>
<p>ready for war.</p>
<p>And I had an, everybody had an object to, uh, to pay attention to.</p>
<p>I had a, uh, uh, a harbor, a military harbor in, um, um, in, in New Jersey, uh, near Red</p>
<p>Bank that was called Earl Weapon Station.</p>
<p>And the code name for that was early.</p>
<p>So they asked me to just wander by there to see if there was something unusual going on</p>
<p>because the Soviet Union were at that point, it was Ronald Reagan were really afraid that</p>
<p>Reagan was going to start a war.</p>
<p>They were absolutely 100% afraid of him.</p>
<p>Is there something memorable to you on a personal level and a philosophical level about your</p>
<p>time in Moscow?</p>
<p>Something that kind of stays with you outside of the training stuff, maybe like the details</p>
<p>of the training.</p>
<p>You love the answer.</p>
<p>You will love the answer.</p>
<p>Uh, I was, uh, I was given tickets to two, uh, performances by Americans.</p>
<p>Uh, there was a theater troupe that, uh, played Our Town.</p>
<p>Uh, and then there was this, I forgot the name of the guy, but, uh, uh, you may not</p>
<p>be old enough.</p>
<p>Have you ever watched Hee Haw?</p>
<p>Uh, maybe, uh, there was a, it was a country music show, real kitschy, but, uh, the star</p>
<p>of Hee Haw, uh, was giving a concert in Moscow and I guarantee you at least half the audience</p>
<p>were KGB and at the other end, the, uh, uh, um, the, the, the opposite of, uh, of a, of</p>
<p>a highlight was my visit to the, uh, to, to my, to the mausoleum where Lenin, uh, is still,</p>
<p>still today.</p>
<p>There, there was so, there was a nothing, you know, he was, he was my hero, but he,</p>
<p>he looked like a wax figure and, and, and you walk by there, there was nothing inspirational</p>
<p>and not, not, it was not a religious experience, nothing, it was, it was a big old nothing.</p>
<p>Is that, did, did your faith and belief in communism start to crumble at some point here?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Is that around, that was still pretty strong.</p>
<p>What I did notice that, uh, the standard of living in, in, in Moscow was significantly</p>
<p>lower than in East Germany.</p>
<p>The, uh, uh, in the supermarkets, uh, you could, you could expect, uh, with reliability</p>
<p>that you can find, uh, canned fish and, uh, mineral water.</p>
<p>Everything else was whatever.</p>
<p>And if you saw a line and at a store, you just line up.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even ask what they have because if you don&rsquo;t like it, somebody else will.</p>
<p>It was, it, it was, uh, not poverty, but it was close to poverty.</p>
<p>There were a lot of drunken men in the streets.</p>
<p>And uh&hellip;</p>
<p>This is the eighties?</p>
<p>No, this is the late seventies, mid to late seventies.</p>
<p>And uh, and also the, they had these high rise apartment buildings that looked pretty</p>
<p>good from the front, but you went into the backyard, ouch.</p>
<p>You know.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re describing my childhood here.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Uh, but it&rsquo;s interesting even, even with the professor, even with everything else, um,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting because I think the standard of living was much lower.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Even in Moscow.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Absolutely was.</p>
<p>The one thing that they always had, at least in my days, was in those two years, there</p>
<p>was always fresh bread in the Bulatnoyars.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Always.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably one of the memories I have of childhood is, well you&rsquo;re hungry a lot,</p>
<p>but when you eat is bread and the bread was good.</p>
<p>It was good.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t, I actually wonder, I wonder how good it was, but I remember it being incredibly</p>
<p>good.</p>
<p>To me it was really good.</p>
<p>And, and you know, you had it from white to very dark and all the varieties.</p>
<p>The other thing that was good was, um, if you knew where to get it, Stolichnaya was</p>
<p>four rubles.</p>
<p>Not only is it good vodka, but it&rsquo;s a cheap vodka.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But you had to know where, you know, this would be like holes in the wall someplace.</p>
<p>Well, I think a lot of the way they operate, I don&rsquo;t, I wonder if East Germany is this</p>
<p>way, but a lot of the ways that Moscow operate is you kind of, you had to know.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a very kind of, um, if you make the right friends, if you give money to the</p>
<p>right guy, the guy, the friend of the friend of the friend is going to hook you up and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a culture that this is how you work around a very big bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Underground economy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Underground economy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You have to know, which is, uh, boy, um, such a stark contrast between, between that and</p>
<p>the United States, the capitalist system.</p>
<p>Um, yeah, that was a very big culture shock to me to understand the different, the different</p>
<p>fundamentally different way of life.</p>
<p>But the interesting thing is, um, human nature pervades both systems and there is something</p>
<p>about the Russian system that reveals human nature more intensely because of the underground</p>
<p>nature of it.</p>
<p>Because you get to deal with greed and trust and all those kinds of things in the United</p>
<p>States, there is much more power to the rule of law.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s rules and people follow those rules, they had to break the rules nonstop.</p>
<p>Well, in East Germany and Russia, I believe, uh, theft, if you could get away with it was</p>
<p>part of your economic activity.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I have a friend, uh, you know, who, who I went to school with, uh, up until my fourth</p>
<p>year and, uh, we reconnected and he told me how he survived, you know, he would, you know,</p>
<p>he would just steal stuff and then sell it and trade it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Thefts.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a relative concept.</p>
<p>You are taking stuff.</p>
<p>Uh, bribery, all those kinds of things, people, you know, um, corruption, you know, it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>relative term.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>I mean, it is, you have to work around the giant bureaucracy about the giant corruption.</p>
<p>Corruption builds on top of corruption and then it just becomes this giant system that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>unstable as you talked about.</p>
<p>One last word.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The two years in Moscow taught me how to be alone.</p>
<p>I had no social interaction.</p>
<p>Not with friends, not with women, not.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I was, the only interaction I had was with the folks that trained me.</p>
<p>So I was alone.</p>
<p>It was a lonely two years.</p>
<p>For a person who, who loves love.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Is that difficult?</p>
<p>It was for my first year and first and second year in the United States because I could</p>
<p>not interact socially without giving away that something was wrong with me.</p>
<p>I had to learn how to be an American.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t teach me in Moscow.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So the first two years in, uh, in America, you had to kind of listen more than talk.</p>
<p>Oh, you bet.</p>
<p>The very first year I couldn&rsquo;t even work because I had to acquire the documents, the social</p>
<p>security card and a driver&rsquo;s license, uh, to get a job.</p>
<p>And then when I had the job, uh, I worked as a bike messenger, uh, that gave me a good</p>
<p>opportunity to listen as, as, you know, because these people, they weren&rsquo;t very curious about</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>What was your name in East Germany, what was your name in Moscow, what was your name in</p>
<p>America?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So my, the name I was given at birth is Albrecht Dittrich.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so sexy when you speak in German with a German accent.</p>
<p>I hate, I hated that name, the Albrecht.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>It was, it was very rarely used.</p>
<p>Uh, my mother named me after a famous German painter, Albrecht Dittrich.</p>
<p>My cover name in Moscow was known as Dieter and, and, and in the United States I became</p>
<p>Jack Barsky.</p>
<p>In between I used a whole bunch of other names that were associated with, uh, false passports</p>
<p>that, uh, uh, I used.</p>
<p>One of the names I remember is William Dyson because that is the name that was on the Canadian</p>
<p>passport I used to enter the United States.</p>
<p>So how did you enter the United States?</p>
<p>Can we take the journey from Moscow to the United States?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What was the assignment?</p>
<p>What was the, what was that leap?</p>
<p>What was like, what, uh.</p>
<p>Just one, one, one thing in between, I had a three months practice trip to, to, uh, Canada.</p>
<p>That was, that was a good idea and I got to tell you this, this one thing that happened</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>Yes, please.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, because, you know, the one, one thing that I like to tell people nowadays is the,</p>
<p>one of the secrets to happiness is the ability to make fun of the worst situations that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in.</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>You see the humor.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>In hindsight, at least, uh, one of my, uh, the tasks that I had in, in, in Canada was</p>
<p>to acquire a birth certificate, uh, with the name, uh, the name was Henry Van Randall,</p>
<p>who was born someplace in California.</p>
<p>And I was supposed to, uh, you know, write a little letter saying, I&rsquo;m Henry Van Randall.</p>
<p>Please send me a copy of my birth certificate.</p>
<p>The fee is enclosed and, uh, and, and I, uh, I lived in a small hotel.</p>
<p>So the return address, it wasn&rsquo;t visible that it was a hotel.</p>
<p>That was important.</p>
<p>So, and it took like three weeks and I get nothing, four weeks, I get nothing.</p>
<p>Eventually I got annoyed and I, I, I, I mustered the courage to call them up from a pay phone.</p>
<p>I called up the office registrar, whatever they were called in this, in this town in</p>
<p>California and I, and I yelled at them, I said, you got my money, where&rsquo;s my birth certificate?</p>
<p>Well, a couple of weeks later it came.</p>
<p>So I see the envelope and it says Henry Van Randall.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I had prepared the caretakers of the, um, of the hotel to, that I&rsquo;m expecting a letter</p>
<p>from my friend.</p>
<p>So I went up to my room, I opened it and I was like, yes, yes, this is success.</p>
<p>And then, and then I opened this thing and it was, it was a copy of a birth certificate,</p>
<p>but it was stamped with big letters across in red deceased.</p>
<p>Now think about it.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a dead people who was asking for that person who was asking for a birth certificate.</p>
<p>I had the presence of mind to, to leave.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I went to a couple of other cities.</p>
<p>I should have left the country.</p>
<p>But I know that the Royal Mounted Police was following me and I was given that information</p>
<p>by the FBI later on.</p>
<p>And they were,</p>
<p>You were able to, oh, you were able to at least suspect that at the time through the,</p>
<p>the, the,</p>
<p>I knew that, I knew that there was trouble.</p>
<p>So I, my counter surveillance route, yes, didn&rsquo;t discover anything.</p>
<p>So I kept on going, I had to, supposed to, I was supposed to visit two more cities and</p>
<p>they were always one step behind.</p>
<p>What, what, what is interesting to me is that they didn&rsquo;t catch me on the way out.</p>
<p>You have to show your passport to the airline.</p>
<p>I mean, I, I, I was known by name.</p>
<p>I would then, the path, because I had to give that to the hotel, right.</p>
<p>And I, and I escaped with, by a hair.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They, they would have to keep you on a list, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>But that requires like a good computerized updated system to track all that stuff.</p>
<p>This was Swiss air, so.</p>
<p>Well, you got lucky.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Part of life is luck.</p>
<p>You bet.</p>
<p>So, so, and, and other than that, the, the trip to Canada was a big success because it,</p>
<p>it gave me the culture shock that, that I needed to not be blown out of, out of the</p>
<p>water.</p>
<p>And when I get, get to the United States.</p>
<p>So you hopped a few places in Canada and then Swiss air.</p>
<p>I even had a, I even had a relationship with a young lady.</p>
<p>A Canadian, French Canadian, regular Canadian.</p>
<p>French Canadian, and she, she gave me a book, Winnie the Pooh, because we went to see the</p>
<p>movie and then she wrote the dedication, she says, to the nicest German I&rsquo;ve ever met.</p>
<p>Was she lying?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Or you don&rsquo;t know, maybe.</p>
<p>Speaking of Spycraft, and that, that led to heartbreak too?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>That was sexual.</p>
<p>I was not at that point.</p>
<p>Ready for love?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Ready to return to that old.</p>
<p>Well, and I was, I was already married in Germany.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That woman I loved.</p>
<p>We should return to this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So Swiss air, where did you land in the United States?</p>
<p>Oh, when I came, where did I land?</p>
<p>I, I, American Airlines, a flight from Mexico City to Toronto, but they made me deplane</p>
<p>in Chicago.</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>I think this was overengineering.</p>
<p>That didn&rsquo;t make any sense to me.</p>
<p>You know, why can&rsquo;t a Canadian just take a, take a flight from Mexico City?</p>
<p>With this stopover, this kind of nonsense.</p>
<p>Yeah, but, okay.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, that was it, and then you landed in Chicago.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And tell me the story in America.</p>
<p>What was the day to day life?</p>
<p>Now this is, now you&rsquo;re a spy.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>I got to tell you another funny story.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s another, there&rsquo;s two things that happened that could have ended my career as a spy right</p>
<p>then and there.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m, so I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m arriving in, in Chicago in the evening.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already dark.</p>
<p>I had no idea what kind of a hotel to take, you know, I picked one out of a, out of yellow</p>
<p>pages and got a taxi.</p>
<p>When I gave him the address, he looked at me like a little funny, you know, whatever,</p>
<p>what do I know?</p>
<p>You know, it was keep on going.</p>
<p>I need to get, I need to get sleep because I was extremely tense, you know, having gone</p>
<p>through customs and border control.</p>
<p>So and we were going in the Southern direction and I noticed that the neighborhoods became</p>
<p>less and less inviting.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t know what that meant either.</p>
<p>I get, I enter the hotel, it was a five story brownstone and something else looked funny.</p>
<p>So the reception desk was protected by plexiglass.</p>
<p>Not having enough background, I didn&rsquo;t know that this was unusual because all I knew that</p>
<p>there was a lot of crime in the United States.</p>
<p>So I thought maybe every hotel was like that.</p>
<p>So I go up into my room and drink a half a bottle of, uh, Johnny Walker red because I,</p>
<p>as one does, yeah, because I was so damn tense.</p>
<p>I just wanted to sleep.</p>
<p>I wanted to get into a coma, which I did.</p>
<p>And then the next day I woke up with a head that was twice as big as felt twice as big.</p>
<p>But you know, I was prepared.</p>
<p>I had aspirin with me, so I killed the headache and went outside to see if I can get something</p>
<p>to eat.</p>
<p>And, uh, so I was right smack in the middle of the South side of Chicago.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that the South side of Chicago existed.</p>
<p>I found later, I found out where I was.</p>
<p>So it was time to go very quickly, uh, go up there.</p>
<p>And at that point I decided I would, uh, uh, I would register, uh, at the next hotel on</p>
<p>the Jack Barsky.</p>
<p>So I went to the bathroom and I tried to kill, kill off, uh, uh, Mr. Dyson by burning his</p>
<p>passport.</p>
<p>Um, unfortunately I was not trained in how to train passport, uh, how to, how to destroy</p>
<p>passports was, uh, so I tried to burn it and these things are flame retardant.</p>
<p>And, uh, it created a cloud of smoke and I&rsquo;m looking up there and there&rsquo;s a smoke detector.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So presence of mind, I threw this thing in the toilet and then, then took out a pair</p>
<p>of scissors and cut it into small pieces and flushed it down.</p>
<p>If that smoke alarm goes off, I&rsquo;m busted.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>If somebody, if, if some, some criminal steals, I had $6,000 on me in cash, uh, steals either</p>
<p>my passport or my, or my money or both.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t go to the authorities.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>There weren&rsquo;t, there weren&rsquo;t any Russian, the Soviets in Chicago.</p>
<p>Do you have any contacts?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>There was no, there was no, um, there was no plan B for Chicago at all.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an oversight.</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t, I shouldn&rsquo;t have gone to Chicago.</p>
<p>They, they could have shipped me into, uh, um, uh, San Francisco or Washington DC because</p>
<p>both of them had Soviets.</p>
<p>My end goal was, uh, was to go to, to, to New York.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Uh, you know, I would have been a really, really, uh, dangerous agent if I had gone</p>
<p>back and worked with the KGB because I could have told them all the things, how to do it</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So in that sense, there is some, given the scale of the KGB, there is, uh, some incompetence</p>
<p>in this.</p>
<p>Some.</p>
<p>A lot of incompetence.</p>
<p>Uh, to preparing me to be an American was almost total incompetence.</p>
<p>And that, do you think that&rsquo;s representative of the way they operate is, uh, there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>incompetence like to the, uh, logistics, to the strategies involved, all that kind of</p>
<p>stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>None of these guys had operated as illegals.</p>
<p>They, they were outsiders to American society.</p>
<p>They had interaction with Americans and, uh, but they all lived in, you know, in New York,</p>
<p>they lived in a compound, uh, and in Northern Manhattan where they all lived together with</p>
<p>their families.</p>
<p>And, and they, most of the time they spent, uh, interacting with, with themselves, with</p>
<p>their own people at work.</p>
<p>So they really didn&rsquo;t integrate well.</p>
<p>They did not know what it&rsquo;s like to be an American, to have a job, to, to, you know,</p>
<p>live like an American.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t know it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that KGB didn&rsquo;t put a high value to that kind of integration.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t know what they didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And by the way, this was mutual.</p>
<p>Do you think the CIA had, had, uh, good knowledge of the Russian culture?</p>
<p>Uh, same thing.</p>
<p>And so, um, there was a lot of lack of understanding because good, good intelligence could have,</p>
<p>uh, possibly avoided some of the, uh, high tension that, uh, situations that we had when,</p>
<p>when in the eighties, we got close to nuclear war.</p>
<p>So good intelligence would be integrating yourself in society.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Much, much deeper.</p>
<p>And that Ronald Reagan was not a warmonger, but he was talking about the end times because</p>
<p>he was a Christian.</p>
<p>But then that kind of integration can be dangerous because you start to question the propaganda,</p>
<p>the narratives that, on which the KGB is built, on which the CIA is built.</p>
<p>And then they have, they always have had the option of ignoring the intelligence that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you this question sort of to jump around.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of conspiracy theories in this, um, in this current climate, I mean, throughout</p>
<p>history, but now especially, and some of the conspiracy theories put a lot of power in</p>
<p>the hands of the intelligence agencies like CIA, FSB, Mossad, uh, MI6, they&rsquo;re basically</p>
<p>the conspiracy theories go that they control the powerful people in this world.</p>
<p>And are able to thereby manipulate those powerful people and manipulate the populace in order</p>
<p>to deliver different kinds of messages and so on.</p>
<p>Given your experience with this kind of tension between competence and malevolence, would</p>
<p>you say there&rsquo;s some truth to those conspiracy theories?</p>
<p>Not one way.</p>
<p>I think, I think there is, there&rsquo;s collusion, there&rsquo;s collaboration, but I would think that,</p>
<p>uh, like for instance, uh, uh, some folks in the CIA and the FBI, uh, are being used</p>
<p>by the ones that are really in power.</p>
<p>Power is money.</p>
<p>Power is wealth.</p>
<p>I know power is not the other, it can go both directions.</p>
<p>You can acquire wealth first, which leads you to power, or you can acquire power first.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Power is also knowledge, I understand, and, and, uh, and a position in the society, in</p>
<p>the military or in intelligence, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a straight one way that all the</p>
<p>intelligence agencies control the powerful people in their country.</p>
<p>You see what&rsquo;s happening in Russia.</p>
<p>I mean, Putin dominates his intelligence agencies, right?</p>
<p>Well, uh, so the question is which way the direction goes, but you&rsquo;re saying that there</p>
<p>is, um, it&rsquo;s not one way flow of power.</p>
<p>I would think so.</p>
<p>It, and, and I also believe it exists, but it&rsquo;s not as prevalent as, you know, not every</p>
<p>conspiracy theory, uh, pans out and most of them don&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;re just damn rumors, but</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>I guarantee you that they exist.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s collusion, there&rsquo;s people getting together and, uh, not necessarily, uh, preparing</p>
<p>a specific action, but more sort of a plan to go forward and maintain the position or</p>
<p>even, you know, uh, uh, strengthen the position that they already have.</p>
<p>So KGB, but we can generalize this, FSB, CIA, do you think a KGB agent would kill someone</p>
<p>against international law if they were ordered to do so?</p>
<p>So we talked about&hellip;</p>
<p>They did.</p>
<p>Uh, and there&rsquo;s, uh, there&rsquo;s a famous, uh, case of, uh, one, uh, uh, I think it&rsquo;s Vasily</p>
<p>Kuklov who defected.</p>
<p>He was a killer.</p>
<p>He was a trained killer and he had, had, uh, done assassinations in other countries.</p>
<p>He was sent to West Germany to kill a defector, a KGB defector, and he decided not to do it.</p>
<p>He, he talked to the guy and he said, I&rsquo;m supposed to kill you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>And then, and he eventually wound up in the United States.</p>
<p>I have a connection to this fellow because the KGB once asked me to go to California</p>
<p>and see if the guy still lives and works there.</p>
<p>And, uh, we, uh, I found him and we looked at each other.</p>
<p>So there was an active KGB agent looking at a man that he didn&rsquo;t know was the KGB defector,</p>
<p>looking at each other.</p>
<p>Neither one knew who the other one was.</p>
<p>I found out later.</p>
<p>But he was able to survive.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And, you know, there, there have been assassinations, not, not a lot.</p>
<p>And, uh, you know, that, that we know of, a good point.</p>
<p>This is very difficult, uh, the, the, the, the, the question is how many lines are intelligence</p>
<p>agencies able, willing to cross to attain, to achieve the goal?</p>
<p>I, I think none of these agencies have the ultimate line.</p>
<p>I think eventually they, the last line will be crossed if they believe it&rsquo;s necessary.</p>
<p>Well, I think you can justify a lot of things, especially in this modern world with nuclear</p>
<p>weapons that you can justify that you&rsquo;re saving the world actually.</p>
<p>Let me ask a few difficult questions and we&rsquo;ll jump back to your time in America.</p>
<p>But Vladimir Putin has been accused of ordering the poisoning and assassination of several</p>
<p>people, including Alexander Levinenko early on all the way to Alexei Navalny.</p>
<p>Do you think these accusations are grounded in truth?</p>
<p>And we will return to a couple more questions maybe about Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s early days in</p>
<p>the KGB, which would be interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There, there&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s a phrase that I like to, uh, say in the response is called</p>
<p>plausible deniability.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Putin gave a direct command as they do that.</p>
<p>He would just maybe muse.</p>
<p>It would be nice if something were to happen and then somebody picks it up and does it.</p>
<p>Is there, can you steel man the case that, uh, Putin did not have direct or indirect</p>
<p>involvement with this?</p>
<p>Who, who, who would know, who would know?</p>
<p>You know, just the, the international, the reputation perhaps, um, perhaps catalyzed</p>
<p>by Putin himself is that he is the kind of person that would directly or indirectly make</p>
<p>those orders.</p>
<p>Perhaps the case there is he&rsquo;s somebody to be feared and thereby you want that person</p>
<p>out there.</p>
<p>Uh, but the act itself, uh, the, the, the poisoning of, uh, Litvinenko and, uh, Oh,</p>
<p>and then the assassination of the Bulgarian, uh, Markov and with a, with the umbrella</p>
<p>and, and they all directly traced back to Russian, uh, Soviet intelligence.</p>
<p>Uh, and so that&rsquo;s enough to be feared, right?</p>
<p>Um, my answer that I gave you is an educated guess, you know, I can&rsquo;t pretend to know this</p>
<p>for sure, but</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s frustrating to me because there&rsquo;s a lot of people listening to this would say,</p>
<p>but even, uh, sort of would chuckle at the naive nature of the question.</p>
<p>But if you actually keep an open mind, you have to understand what is the way that intelligence</p>
<p>agencies function?</p>
<p>Is it possible to the head of an intelligence agency not to make direct orders of that kind</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a distributed</p>
<p>No, the head of the intelligence agency would most likely give the order.</p>
<p>Even though it&rsquo;s compartmentalized.</p>
<p>Yeah, but, but, uh, but not the head of state.</p>
<p>Not maybe not the head of state, although, uh, in the case, this is the case in the United</p>
<p>States as well, but certainly is the case in Russia.</p>
<p>There are close relationships between the head of the FSB and the GRU and personal relationships,</p>
<p>not just even</p>
<p>The head of the FSB who is now in jail.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a interesting details, especially, uh, coming out recently around the war in</p>
<p>Ukraine.</p>
<p>So let me actually ask about the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>What is your analysis of the war in Ukraine from 2014 to the full on invasion of Ukraine</p>
<p>by Russia in 2022 in February, 2022?</p>
<p>But um, there&rsquo;s many questions we could ask.</p>
<p>One is, what are the sins of the governments involved?</p>
<p>What are the sins of Russia, Ukraine, America, China?</p>
<p>Are those sins comparable?</p>
<p>Who are the good guys and the bad guys?</p>
<p>That was more than one question.</p>
<p>Let me just, uh, uh, give you my, the basics about this savvy observers saw this coming.</p>
<p>There were very small minority, uh, because Vladimir Putin was pretty open about what</p>
<p>he told the world his mission was, was the reestablishment of a strong Russia, the reestablishment</p>
<p>of something like the, the Russian empire to unite all the Russian speaking, uh, uh,</p>
<p>people, uh, in, under one country and, uh, the world ignored him.</p>
<p>I mean, he was open, uh, what was, was at a, at a conference in, in, in, in France,</p>
<p>I believe when we, we set this out, out in the open, uh, and then what we had, uh, in</p>
<p>the United States, we had wishful, wishful thinking, you know, Obama had this reset with</p>
<p>Russia, you know, we all get friendly.</p>
<p>And then when, when, uh, uh, Putin invaded, uh, Crimea, we did nothing.</p>
<p>So and it, and it just escalated slowly, but surely it was pretty clear.</p>
<p>And then they said, uh, it was, I think two years ago, there was an essay published by,</p>
<p>uh, Putin, whether he wrote it or not, it doesn&rsquo;t matter, but that was also out in public</p>
<p>where he was, again, quite clear what he was going to do.</p>
<p>Now how do you do this with force?</p>
<p>And, uh, and the, the sins committed by the American government was that we ignored it.</p>
<p>We weren&rsquo;t engaged in wishful thinking and we didn&rsquo;t stop it with sanctions before the</p>
<p>shooting started.</p>
<p>To push back, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re fully describing, you are describing the sins of the Russian</p>
<p>government and Putin.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re fully describing the sins of the American government here because</p>
<p>not only didn&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re doing, you&rsquo;re describing the miscalculation.</p>
<p>So not only did they not pressure correctly with sanctions and so on and, and, and clearly</p>
<p>respond to the actual statements and the essays and the words spoken.</p>
<p>I know where you&rsquo;re going, but keep on speaking.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But they also, at the same time, pressured, pressured Russia and they also, as, as Putin</p>
<p>himself said, sort of, there&rsquo;s a rat and they pushed the rat towards the corner by expanding</p>
<p>NATO and, uh, and arming Ukraine and the military industrial complex is a machine that, uh,</p>
<p>that led us, um, and I think a lot of younger people, I mean, when I came to this country</p>
<p>and this is the country I love, I lived through 9 11, I lived through the full roller coaster</p>
<p>of emotion.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a, at that time, before that and after was a proud American.</p>
<p>I went through the whole roller coaster of, uh, being sold, uh, I would say a lie about</p>
<p>the reason to invade Iraq and even Afghanistan.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve got to live through understanding of this military industrial complex that leads</p>
<p>to the expansion of vampires, of the delusion that we have in the populace, in, in the government</p>
<p>that convinces us that we are the good guys and somehow with military force, we can instill</p>
<p>our values, instill happiness, the pursuit of happiness that all men are created equal</p>
<p>these ideas in, into other lands and we can do so with drones and we can do so with weapons</p>
<p>and we could do so without significant cost to our own, from our own pockets.</p>
<p>And so this idea, this machine doesn&rsquo;t just apply to Afghanistan and Iraq, it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just apply to Yemen and Syria, it doesn&rsquo;t just apply to China, it also applies to Ukraine.</p>
<p>It also applies to Russia.</p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>Two thoughts, if I may, uh, first of all, when does not hear the term military industrial</p>
<p>complex in the public discourse these days, Eisenhower warned about it, Eisenhower was</p>
<p>a capitalist, he was the president of the United States.</p>
<p>So it exists and it is very powerful.</p>
<p>The more weapons you can sell, the more you have to replace them or send over, you have</p>
<p>to replace them.</p>
<p>So yes, the other thing is there&rsquo;s also a messianic streak that powers American foreign</p>
<p>policy.</p>
<p>We want to make the world just like us.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t they get it?</p>
<p>Because they don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like it&rsquo;s not communism, but it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a very similar romantic idea that</p>
<p>we can make the world then fashion the world the way we are.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the romantic side and the sort of honest side, but it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>It failed every time, right?</p>
<p>You know, Afghanistan is a Royal mess and was, would never become a functioning democracy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if, if Ukraine can become a functioning democracy.</p>
<p>So well, I don&rsquo;t know if American weapons can help Ukraine become a functional democracy.</p>
<p>I yeah, but there&rsquo;s a huge amount of interest in seeing the world in black and white and</p>
<p>selling the story of the world is black and white that Ukraine is the symbol of democracy</p>
<p>in this East Eastern European world.</p>
<p>And Russia is the symbol of authoritarian dictatorship.</p>
<p>And the story is not so simple as, as, as many indices show, Ukraine and Russia are</p>
<p>the number one and the number two most corrupt countries in Europe.</p>
<p>There are two P&rsquo;s in a pod.</p>
<p>One is bigger and one is in this case, the aggressor.</p>
<p>Now, you know, two P&rsquo;s, the aggressor is still ultimately responsible.</p>
<p>And the person that throws the first punch.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a lot of people going to disagree where the punch came from, but there is, there</p>
<p>is magnitude and the struggle by Ukraine for its sovereignty stretches back to the beginning</p>
<p>of the 20th century.</p>
<p>It stretches back even further than that.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s been the Ukrainian people are proud people and they&rsquo;ve been in many cases</p>
<p>tortured by those that sit in the Kremlin throughout the 20th century, the, the, the</p>
<p>famine in the, in the early thirties.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s always, it&rsquo;s never the middle class and upper class that suffer.</p>
<p>So is the lower classes, the peasants in that time that this history stretches back far.</p>
<p>And this is yet another manifestation of that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of interests at play.</p>
<p>China watches closely, Russia, America watches closely.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an extra caveat here that there&rsquo;s nuclear weapons at play as well.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s what this is the situation is as dangerous as I have lived through in my entire</p>
<p>life, I believe.</p>
<p>And because it&rsquo;s not necessarily at the highest point of escalation, but it will be in my</p>
<p>view, a protracted crisis.</p>
<p>And the longer that crisis lasts, the more of a chance there is of an accident.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>One rocket.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s seems to be a strong incentive to prolong, to do siege tactics, to prolong this</p>
<p>conflict over perhaps many years, which is terrifying to think about.</p>
<p>And over that, a single rocket can lead to, given that there&rsquo;s leaders that might be losing</p>
<p>their mind and Ukraine is not part of NATO, the thing I&rsquo;m really afraid of is that somebody</p>
<p>might think it&rsquo;s a good idea for Russia.</p>
<p>So Putin might think it&rsquo;s a good idea for Russia to send a message by launching a nuke</p>
<p>against Ukraine because they&rsquo;re not part of NATO.</p>
<p>So surely the West is not going to respond.</p>
<p>What is the West going to do if Russia nukes Ukraine to send a message?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if anyone knows the answer to that question, but it&rsquo;s a terrifying question.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know the exact protocol that needs to be followed to launch a nuclear strike</p>
<p>on NATO&rsquo;s end because we have several countries in NATO that have nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say for France to fire a nuke, does the United States have to agree?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how that works.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if anyone knows how that works.</p>
<p>I worry, now we have different, very kind of anecdotal perspectives on these things,</p>
<p>but the people I&rsquo;ve interacted with in the DOD, Department of Defense, in the military,</p>
<p>there is a compartmentalization, there is a bureaucracy, and within that giant bureaucracy,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s incompetence.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d like to think that there is like really well organized for really important things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be the best of the best in the world that&rsquo;s going to execute on the correct</p>
<p>decisions both geopolitically, militarily, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve seen enough to know that competence at any level of government, at any level in</p>
<p>the military is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go back to the law of hierarchy.</p>
<p>The government is the biggest hierarchy there is.</p>
<p>And so invariably, politicians find their way to the top.</p>
<p>And once you have politics dictating substantive decisions, they&rsquo;re going to be weak or wrong.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how this could work any other way.</p>
<p>Right now we have some functional idiots in the central United States government.</p>
<p>Well, let me, because you said that, I think elsewhere you said that Putin was not a good</p>
<p>KGB agent.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>A mediocre one, but is an excellent politician.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And a good organizer.</p>
<p>He was known as a really, really good organizer.</p>
<p>When Yeltsin hired him as prime minister, he cleaned up the mess because under Yeltsin,</p>
<p>Russia deteriorated tremendously and it became sort of a mix of an oligarchy and a criminal</p>
<p>enterprise and chaotic.</p>
<p>So he had skills that made him a good executive.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s go back to him as a KGB agent.</p>
<p>He was a KGB agent.</p>
<p>I mean, according to him, once a KGB agent, always a KGB agent.</p>
<p>But 16 years, let&rsquo;s say, something like this.</p>
<p>What do you think about, from your experience, now you&rsquo;re maybe the same age as him, approximately</p>
<p>the same age as him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a little younger.</p>
<p>A little younger.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So what do you think about the KGB experience he had made him the man he is?</p>
<p>What aspect of that, from your own experience, how much does that define you, who you are,</p>
<p>how you think about the world, how you analyze the geopolitics of the world, how you analyze</p>
<p>human nature?</p>
<p>Now I got to tell you one thing.</p>
<p>He had a different type of training than I did.</p>
<p>Mine was one on one and he went to school, so to speak.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>Classroom training.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But fundamentally, he was not a top agent.</p>
<p>This is very simple to&hellip; There&rsquo;s only one thing you need to know.</p>
<p>He knows German pretty well.</p>
<p>So where was he deployed?</p>
<p>In East Germany.</p>
<p>Not in West Germany, not in Switzerland, not in Austria.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where they sent the best, right, one would think, generally.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re learning here.</p>
<p>So this is your classification of where they send the best.</p>
<p>People classify all kinds of stuff, like what is the best university in the world?</p>
<p>What is the best football team in the world?</p>
<p>You start to get a sense, the good guys get sent, the best athletes get sent to&hellip; Well,</p>
<p>we disagree on this, but the football team is&hellip; But you have a sense and you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>that the best agents would have been sent to West Germany.</p>
<p>One would think so.</p>
<p>So this is not a forcing argument, but I also have it from a word from the horse&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>Which horse?</p>
<p>I mean, what kind of horse?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the breed of the horse?</p>
<p>Oleg Kalugin.</p>
<p>You know who Oleg Kalugin is.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s still alive.</p>
<p>He was, at one point, the head of counterintelligence for the first directorate, espionage, right?</p>
<p>And Putin was in the first directorate and reported to Kalugin for a while.</p>
<p>And Oleg told me, to my face, that Oleg was not an impressive agent trainee or agent.</p>
<p>That Vladimir Putin was not impressive.</p>
<p>Not impressive at all.</p>
<p>Now he&rsquo;s biased, given this current situation.</p>
<p>Well yeah, he could still make it up because he had this big ruckus when he was in parliament</p>
<p>and called Putin a war criminal about the war in Serbia.</p>
<p>Not only could he make it up, I wouldn&rsquo;t trust his analysis.</p>
<p>I mean, I have to, you know, when people, I&rsquo;ve been working very hard even before this</p>
<p>war to try to understand objective analysis of all the parties involved.</p>
<p>You have to really keep an open mind here to see clearly, to understand if you are to</p>
<p>try to help in some way make a better world.</p>
<p>In this case, stop this war or have all the countries involved flourish, bring out the</p>
<p>best of the people, remove the corruption and the greed and the destructive aspects</p>
<p>of the governments and let the people flourish.</p>
<p>For all of that, you have to put all the biases aside, all the political bickering, all the,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, all the biased analysis.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of propaganda that says that, in fact, Putin was a good agent.</p>
<p>How else would he rise through the ranks, right?</p>
<p>Because he was a good politician and he made a lot of good connections within the KGB.</p>
<p>Allow me to say something here.</p>
<p>You just taught me a lesson and the lesson I should have figured out myself because I</p>
<p>keep on telling people that in the intelligence world, you never know the truth 100%.</p>
<p>So when you said, oh, I could make that up, of course you could have.</p>
<p>But you get to a point where you&rsquo;re forced to make a decision or have an opinion and</p>
<p>then you use your best educated guess.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna take the certainty of the statement that I made back because it&rsquo;s quite possible</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Well, what I&rsquo;ve noticed about Vladimir Putin, and this is true about, for example, Donald</p>
<p>Trump and all those kinds of divisive figures, that for some reason people&rsquo;s opinion on the</p>
<p>details of those people are very sticky.</p>
<p>Once you decide this is a bad guy, there&rsquo;s like a black hole and people are not able</p>
<p>to think one act at a time.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to, that doesn&rsquo;t somehow justify this, this somehow doesn&rsquo;t remove all the</p>
<p>evil things that are done, but you can analyze clearly each of the actions.</p>
<p>And to me, it is interesting to see how did this man rise through the ranks.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re saying that to be a KGB agent, there&rsquo;s a lot of skills involved.</p>
<p>Perhaps raw technical skill of spycraft is perhaps not related to the skill of rising</p>
<p>through the ranks.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying as a politician, he was good at rising through the ranks.</p>
<p>Lying and influencing, that is something that is significant as a significant talent and</p>
<p>ability that an agent must have, that helps you as a politician.</p>
<p>Continuing the kind of thread of the role of KGB in defining the heart, soul, and mind</p>
<p>of Vladimir Putin, let me return to Yuri Bismenov, who was a Soviet KGB agent that wrote a four</p>
<p>step framework for ideological subversion on a national scale as practiced by the Soviet</p>
<p>Union.</p>
<p>And the four steps are demoralization, destabilization, crisis, and normalization.</p>
<p>He had a lot of other kind of systematic ways of describing this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So can you speak to some of these ideas about the systematic large scale ideological subversion</p>
<p>goals of the KGB?</p>
<p>Is there truth to that kind of those ideas?</p>
<p>Yes, but I think I already sort of mentioned that I think Bismenov was a fraud.</p>
<p>And I have, again, good arguments, let&rsquo;s put it this way.</p>
<p>First of all, we know that the KGB was involved in active measures, which is&hellip;</p>
<p>You can call it fake news.</p>
<p>Putting fake news into the countries that are your adversaries.</p>
<p>And the Russians have been doing this lately by meddling in our election and focusing</p>
<p>on the left and the right fringe and influencing them to become more left and more right.</p>
<p>And Vasily Mitrokhin has in one of his books, he has a whole chapter about active measures.</p>
<p>Okay, so what he has to say about the department, and I forgot what department that was, was</p>
<p>the one department that was the least desirable for KGB agents.</p>
<p>Because these were desk jobs for people who had to come up with fake stories in countries</p>
<p>where they didn&rsquo;t quite know too much about the country.</p>
<p>Now there were some successes, like one of the two most famous successes that I&rsquo;m aware</p>
<p>of is that the AIDS virus was concocted in a CIA lab, and a lot of people around the</p>
<p>world believe that.</p>
<p>And the other one was that J. Edgar Hoover was a secret cross dresser.</p>
<p>That is still known by a lot of Americans who are of a certain age that this was the</p>
<p>truth.</p>
<p>But Mitrokhin actually traces it back to a story that was placed in a sort of left wing</p>
<p>but close to mainstream French magazine, and it was then taken up by larger newspapers</p>
<p>and well established papers.</p>
<p>So they had some successes, but this kind of a massive, well thought out campaign to</p>
<p>destabilize the United States, I don&rsquo;t believe the KGB was capable of doing that.</p>
<p>Mitrokhin seems to agree with me.</p>
<p>I was trained, I would think, I was one of the crown jewels of their agents.</p>
<p>One would think that they used the best that they had to help me how to become an American,</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t have a clue.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know how a country operates, how do you come up with this kind of a very</p>
<p>detailed long term plan that&rsquo;s also timed, two years this and one year that and all that?</p>
<p>Yeah, so we should actually just clarify.</p>
<p>He has this whole idea that there&rsquo;s 15 to 20 years needed for demoralization where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>basically infiltrating a country or people from a young age, manipulating their mind.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re destabilizing them, that&rsquo;s the second step that takes two to five years.</p>
<p>You target the country&rsquo;s foreign relations, defense and economy.</p>
<p>You create a crisis artificially and then you normalize it as if it always was this</p>
<p>way.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically saying that the KGB is capable of, at scale, over many years, manipulate</p>
<p>an entire population of people.</p>
<p>And this is kind of, there&rsquo;s a lot of people that believe in conspiracy theories that are</p>
<p>amenable to this kind of idea.</p>
<p>Now, my own experience is that there is, in fact, just a giant amount of incompetence</p>
<p>and that this is something that&rsquo;s actually very difficult to pull off because it&rsquo;s incredibly</p>
<p>difficult to achieve this kind of manipulation.</p>
<p>I think it would require, first of all, not much bureaucracy, not much slowing down.</p>
<p>You have to have incredible, in the modern world, digital systems that are able to do</p>
<p>surveillance, manipulation.</p>
<p>There has to be a strategy that is carried out in secrecy across a huge number of people</p>
<p>effectively that also requires you hire the best people in the world.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s difficult to execute on this kind of thing if you compartmentalize because</p>
<p>there has to be great collaboration.</p>
<p>There has to be a great, where there&rsquo;s a unified vision and coordination across multiple groups.</p>
<p>There has to be, I mean, it&rsquo;s very difficult to do.</p>
<p>Now, nevertheless, especially with technology, this becomes easier and easier.</p>
<p>So the bar goes lower and lower.</p>
<p>To achieve mass surveillance becomes easier and easier and easier.</p>
<p>Mass manipulation through platforms, because we&rsquo;re now digitally connected, you can now</p>
<p>do that kind of manipulation.</p>
<p>So it becomes more and more realistic that you could do this kind of thing.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying that, no, intelligence, first of all, intelligence is hard.</p>
<p>And to do it at scale and to do it well and to do it in a way that it&rsquo;s also not just</p>
<p>collecting information about the populace, but manipulating the populace is very, very</p>
<p>difficult.</p>
<p>Now, let me give you another argument why I think that Besminov was a fraud.</p>
<p>I mean, I already have, I have Matrokin on my side and my personal observation of the</p>
<p>incompetence that I witnessed.</p>
<p>I mean, they really, really didn&rsquo;t know what they didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So now Besminov was KGB, where was he stationed?</p>
<p>In India.</p>
<p>He was a low level agent in India.</p>
<p>And I told you it was the one thing that the KGB was really good at was compartmentalization.</p>
<p>How does Besminov in India find out about this massive plan that should have been super</p>
<p>secret, right?</p>
<p>He made it up, sorry.</p>
<p>And you know why he got away with it?</p>
<p>Because Americans eat that up, because it&rsquo;s not our fault.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the damn Russians that doing all that bad stuff.</p>
<p>Speaking of the damn Russians doing all that bad stuff, you know about the Internet Research</p>
<p>Agency.</p>
<p>They have been doing quite a bit of damage and I&rsquo;m now familiar with the world of enhanced</p>
<p>artificial persons.</p>
<p>These are the avatars on Facebook and Twitter and so forth that look like real people.</p>
<p>And there are quite a few of them.</p>
<p>And I have a good friend who operates in that realm and he uses, for instance, facial recognition</p>
<p>when he thinks that there&rsquo;s a suspicious character, say, on LinkedIn or on Facebook.</p>
<p>And very often he finds out, yeah, that that person exists, but it&rsquo;s not the person who</p>
<p>it pretends to be.</p>
<p>So basically detecting the artificial, the enhanced artificial person.</p>
<p>But he can also make them.</p>
<p>You think the United States doesn&rsquo;t do it?</p>
<p>We do it too.</p>
<p>Well, this is to push back against your pushback, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, Bezmenov might be a fraud, but is it possible, especially in the modern age, that</p>
<p>there is these kind of large scale systematic operatives?</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t you, as a government that&rsquo;s investing billions of dollars into military equipment,</p>
<p>in a world that&rsquo;s more and more clearly going to be defined by cyber war versus hot war,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t you start to have serious meetings, large amounts of hires that are working at</p>
<p>how do we manipulate the information flow, how do we manipulate the minds of the populace,</p>
<p>how do we sell them a narrative?</p>
<p>So even though he might have been making up a story because people eat it up, could it</p>
<p>speak to some deep truth that&rsquo;s actually different than the truth you came up in as a KGB agent?</p>
<p>I agree with you 100%.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much easier when all you need is an army of nerds who also know.</p>
<p>No offense to nerds.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a term of endearment I use.</p>
<p>Yes, I love nerds.</p>
<p>I used to be one myself, but anyway.</p>
<p>Once a nerd, always a nerd.</p>
<p>So what I was going to say here is.</p>
<p>All you need is an army of nerds.</p>
<p>And what also experts in the culture of the target country.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And nowadays the world is different.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole lot more fluidity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole lot of more people that like say Russians, for instance, study in the United</p>
<p>States, Chinese, an army of Chinese studying in the United States, they have a lot more</p>
<p>knowledge of how we function than the KGB did and it&rsquo;s vice versa.</p>
<p>Not as many Americans in Russia, but we have some, but the Chinese and the Russians have</p>
<p>an advantage here.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a question based on your experience?</p>
<p>So I have been talking to a lot of powerful people and some of which have very close connections</p>
<p>to in this particular conflict, Ukraine and Russia, but in other places as well.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve ever been contacted by or interacted with an intelligence agency.</p>
<p>CIA, FSB, MI6, Mossad, I don&rsquo;t think I had, well, let me say explicitly, I haven&rsquo;t had</p>
<p>an official conversation, which is what I assume I would have because I have nothing</p>
<p>to hide.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s no reason for people to be secretive.</p>
<p>But would I, why is that, would I know, am I interesting at all, how are people determined</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re a person of interest or not?</p>
<p>And I guess the question, I mean, some of it I ask in a bit of a humorous way, but also</p>
<p>perhaps there&rsquo;s truth in some of the humors.</p>
<p>Would I know if I have ever interacted with a intelligence agency spy?</p>
<p>Well, you don&rsquo;t know that you haven&rsquo;t been contacted, but certainly not, I think you</p>
<p>never had a conversation that related to intelligence in any way, shape, or form, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like where a person, another person introduced themselves.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Introduced themselves or becomes, sort of wants to be your friend and then talks about</p>
<p>these types of topics, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I, there&rsquo;s people because of who I&rsquo;m interacting with, they&rsquo;re, I mean, even with just, even</p>
<p>with Elon Musk, like if you think about Elon Musk, there&rsquo;s a lot of people that are, that</p>
<p>are part of the conversations that happen.</p>
<p>How do I know they&rsquo;re all trustworthy?</p>
<p>They all present themselves as trustworthy.</p>
<p>Now, again, I have nothing, so this is, this is for the intelligence agencies.</p>
<p>I have nothing to hide.</p>
<p>I am the same person privately as publicly, well intentioned, real, no, no controlled,</p>
<p>no weird sexual stuff where you can manipulate me.</p>
<p>What else?</p>
<p>No drug use.</p>
<p>No drug use, no, no skeletons in the closet, none of that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But you know, I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know, I mean, just even having these conversations, you</p>
<p>know, I tend to trust people as a default.</p>
<p>Yeah, me too.</p>
<p>And you start when you think, well, especially with some of the people I&rsquo;ve been talking</p>
<p>with and some of the traveling I&rsquo;m doing, I&rsquo;m realizing there&rsquo;s a, you know, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard men in this world, there&rsquo;s military, there&rsquo;s serious suffering and there&rsquo;s war</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s serious people that are doing serious harm and so you have to be careful</p>
<p>of thinking who to trust.</p>
<p>The person approaches you with a smile and asks you a question.</p>
<p>My natural inclination is that person is a cool person, I&rsquo;ll answer the question, become</p>
<p>a friend.</p>
<p>But it becomes difficult when you realize that there&rsquo;s things like intelligence agencies</p>
<p>with thousands of employees.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people that are doing major military actions that involve tens of thousands, hundreds</p>
<p>of thousands of soldiers.</p>
<p>This is serious stuff and so how do I, how do you know how to operate in this world?</p>
<p>The folks that you&rsquo;re interacting with have a responsibility not to tell you what they</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t tell you, right?</p>
<p>So and most of them probably won&rsquo;t and I&rsquo;m guessing occasionally they will say, well,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t go there, right?</p>
<p>So what you are aware of is sort of public and what you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re collecting</p>
<p>it and you&rsquo;re editing it to some extent, you&rsquo;re not changing the verbage, you just repeat</p>
<p>what they say, so from that angle you&rsquo;re not privy to any real secrets.</p>
<p>What you have possibly that could be of use is you learn to get to know the person.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m thinking there&rsquo;s a good possibility if you get the interviews in the East that</p>
<p>somebody may actually approach you and ask you what&rsquo;s your opinion.</p>
<p>I just hope they approach me and introduce themselves properly.</p>
<p>I just, there&rsquo;s a kind of, I mean, would you know, like how many Russian spies are there</p>
<p>in the United States?</p>
<p>How many American spies are there in Russia?</p>
<p>Do you have a sense?</p>
<p>Is it just like with the GRU?</p>
<p>No idea.</p>
<p>Is it possible there&rsquo;s like tens of thousands and we&rsquo;re not, or like thousands?</p>
<p>Not thousands like I used to operate.</p>
<p>We are too hard to train and we weren&rsquo;t that successful to begin with, but particularly</p>
<p>Russians and Chinese, both governments know who is going abroad and I guarantee you there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of amateur spies, they&rsquo;re being asked to help us out, do something for the motherland.</p>
<p>And crowdsource spying.</p>
<p>Yeah, sort of.</p>
<p>Not serious training, but yeah.</p>
<p>For instance, this lady, I forgot her first name, Butina, she was a rank amateur.</p>
<p>She used social media to communicate with Moscow.</p>
<p>She had no training, but she was reasonably successful.</p>
<p>I mean, and the difference between, let&rsquo;s say, the current Russian intelligence and</p>
<p>the KGB, Vladimir Putin and his henchmen are okay with people being caught because, and</p>
<p>every time I go and talk and give a talk someplace, I&rsquo;m always asked this question, how many Russian</p>
<p>spies do you think we have here?</p>
<p>Because that scares the people, right?</p>
<p>And Putin likes to scare people.</p>
<p>The KGB was very solicitous of their agents.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t want any one of them caught, all right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a big difference.</p>
<p>So for the FSB, getting caught sends a strong signal to the world that there&rsquo;s agents everywhere.</p>
<p>Yeah, there could be many more.</p>
<p>And there probably are, but because also the world, again, there&rsquo;s a whole lot more travel</p>
<p>going on, a whole lot more interaction, studying abroad, doing business.</p>
<p>And there will be attempted espionage probably every minute in this country.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean they will be successful, no.</p>
<p>But there is a cottage industry now that is doing quite well that teaches companies how</p>
<p>to fortify themselves against industrial espionage or also foreign actors spying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all over the place.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>As it becomes easier and easier with digital, with cyber, that becomes a serious, very serious</p>
<p>threat.</p>
<p>We might wind up in a world where nobody knows anymore what&rsquo;s up and what&rsquo;s down.</p>
<p>If I was to have a conversation with Vladimir Putin and or Vladimir Zelensky, is there something</p>
<p>you would ask about the time in the KGB and the time in his past?</p>
<p>All of us, men and women, are creations of the experiences we have in our life, early</p>
<p>on in life and through the formative experiences, successes and failures.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, you just said the key words.</p>
<p>I would ask, without giving away anything, just being high level, your biggest success</p>
<p>and your biggest failure.</p>
<p>As a politician or as a KGB agent?</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re talking in the realm of KGB.</p>
<p>When the wall came down, and he was in an office, a KGB office in the city of Dresden,</p>
<p>and East Germans were besieging Stasi offices, and they also dropped by the KGB office, and</p>
<p>they were&hellip;</p>
<p>It was pretty threatening.</p>
<p>It looked like they would actually storm the office and get, you know, the documents and</p>
<p>stuff like that.</p>
<p>And initially, the first demonstration was told that if they come any closer, weapons</p>
<p>would be used.</p>
<p>So, they disappeared, and then they came back, and I don&rsquo;t know, somebody in that office</p>
<p>called Berlin and said, what are we gonna do?</p>
<p>Are we allowed to use force?</p>
<p>And the answer came back that Gorbachev said, absolutely not.</p>
<p>And so, this is where Putin, all of a sudden, you know, he was at one point a member of</p>
<p>the greatest, the most powerful intelligence organization in the world, and all of a sudden,</p>
<p>he was powerless, and he had to watch how, you know, this was a defeat, big one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s supposedly a powerful intelligence agency cowering, sort of crawling back into a position</p>
<p>of weakness.</p>
<p>And he probably promised himself, never again, Russia needs to be great again.</p>
<p>The KGB, FSB, Russia, the Russian Empire needs to rise again, and that there&rsquo;s a feeling</p>
<p>for him that that&rsquo;s, as he talks about the collapse of the Soviet Union being a great</p>
<p>tragedy, there&rsquo;s a feeling like that was, like, never again.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I believe that he has a strong conviction that, I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s religious, he</p>
<p>carries the cross now, but I don&rsquo;t know what that means, but somehow, but that it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>destiny of the Russian nation to be great, and that is sort of, whether it&rsquo;s determined</p>
<p>by God or some higher power, that is very important for him.</p>
<p>Of course, that nationalist idea is one that Americans share as well, and it could help</p>
<p>a nation flourish, so by itself, it&rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing, it&rsquo;s how it manifests</p>
<p>itself is the question.</p>
<p>One other thing, if I were to get a chat with the Ukrainian president, I would ask him,</p>
<p>how many lives, what is the equation between giving up some land and how many lives are</p>
<p>worth this land?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a good way to phrase the question, of course, that question gets you killed in</p>
<p>Ukraine, but because there&rsquo;s another part of that equation, which is it&rsquo;s not just land</p>
<p>versus lives, it&rsquo;s the sovereignty, the knowledge that you&rsquo;re free and you&rsquo;re self determined,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not about fighting for the particular land, it&rsquo;s saying we are messed up, corrupt,</p>
<p>we have problems, it&rsquo;s a messy world, but it&rsquo;s our world.</p>
<p>I think Stephen Crane has a poem about a man eating his own heart, and he was asked how</p>
<p>does it taste, and he said it&rsquo;s bitter, but I like it because it is bitter and because</p>
<p>it is my heart, and that there&rsquo;s a sense of I want, this is not just about land, this</p>
<p>is our nation.</p>
<p>The same love of nation that Putin has for Russia, the greater Russia, this vision of</p>
<p>this great empire, I believe Ukraine does as well.</p>
<p>Not every nation, there&rsquo;s levels to this game, and Ukrainian people are some of the proudest</p>
<p>people throughout the history of the 20th century, throughout the history of Earth.</p>
<p>The Polish people are proud people.</p>
<p>You can just see in World War II, the people who said fuck you, you&rsquo;re not having this,</p>
<p>we will die to the last man.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s different cultures that kind of really hold their ground, and Ukrainian people are</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>You know, I have to admit, in that respect, I&rsquo;m a bit of a coward.</p>
<p>I could not do what Zelensky has been doing.</p>
<p>I would sort of try to find a way to carve out something that I can live with, however,</p>
<p>if that force, that evil force gets to my family.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lines.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>You become the world&rsquo;s bravest man if somebody crosses that line.</p>
<p>You mentioned something about you&rsquo;ve not been to Moscow back, and that it might not be safe</p>
<p>for you to travel there.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Can you speak to the nature of that?</p>
<p>As somebody that successfully got out of the KGB, how are you still alive?</p>
<p>A number of reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, when my story became public, it was six years ago, I was pretty old, right?</p>
<p>And so the folks that may have a personal interest or may have had a personal interest</p>
<p>in doing me harm, most of them don&rsquo;t live anymore, all right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s number one.</p>
<p>Number two, I did not, I wasn&rsquo;t, I hired hand, a German.</p>
<p>I did not betray the motherland.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a crime that is punished by death.</p>
<p>You betray the motherland.</p>
<p>And the other thing is, you know that these kinds of operations to assassination in another</p>
<p>country are very difficult to plan and implement, and if there&rsquo;s a list of people that they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like, I may not be at the very top.</p>
<p>Having said that, you know, if I wind up, say, in Moscow or even in countries like Turkey</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a lot of lawlessness, you know, accidents can easily be arranged, and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just sending another message, you know, just like, you know, we can do a lot of things.</p>
<p>Powerful.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s safe for me to travel in Russia and Ukraine?</p>
<p>I think you know very well how to communicate in both countries.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;ve shown this in this interaction that you have a lot of empathy for the people</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be talking with, and empathy means good understanding where they&rsquo;re coming from,</p>
<p>and that there are lines that you can&rsquo;t cross.</p>
<p>Like the question that I was going to ask Zelensky, you&rsquo;re not going to ask.</p>
<p>Good for you.</p>
<p>Yeah, isn&rsquo;t that the funny thing about this world?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lines.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lines everywhere.</p>
<p>Even in love, even in personal relationships, there&rsquo;s lines you should not cross.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How did you finally get caught?</p>
<p>I resigned in 1988, so&hellip;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s actually talk about that.</p>
<p>There was a&hellip;</p>
<p>Okay, yeah.</p>
<p>Resigned.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s warning signs.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, okay.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s yet another choice.</p>
<p>Yet another crossroads.</p>
<p>Yes, okay.</p>
<p>What was the calculation?</p>
<p>What was the choice to be made?</p>
<p>To give a little background, it was 1988, and I thought they would&hellip;</p>
<p>My time in the US would soon end because I thought 10 to 12 years, it was already past</p>
<p>10 years.</p>
<p>There was no indication that they indicated, that they said, you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>But in December of 1988, I got this one thing that I never wanted to see.</p>
<p>So we had a system of signals that either one of those diplomat agents could set at</p>
<p>a spot that I pass by every day, or I could set where they would pass by, like on their</p>
<p>way from where they live to the United Nations, for instance, who would just drive.</p>
<p>So the signal spot for me was on a support beam for the elevated atrium in Queens.</p>
<p>And it was morning in December that I walked by there and routinely look at it, and I never</p>
<p>expected anything.</p>
<p>And there was this red dot, it was about the size of my fist with a red paint.</p>
<p>And since you have done it already, I think I can curse in this moment, because it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>only way I can really indicate how I felt, I said, oh shit, because that was the danger</p>
<p>signal.</p>
<p>It was like, you are in severe danger, and you need to get out of the country as soon</p>
<p>as possible.</p>
<p>There was a protocol that I was supposed to follow, I wasn&rsquo;t even supposed to go home,</p>
<p>I just needed to, was supposed to get my reserve documents that I had hidden in a park in the</p>
<p>Bronx and make a beeline to the Canadian border.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t ready.</p>
<p>So I just ignored this thing, I mean, I couldn&rsquo;t ignore it, but I went on to work, got on the</p>
<p>A train, went to work, and then went to my cubicle and stared at the computer screen</p>
<p>all day because I couldn&rsquo;t think.</p>
<p>I could think only about what to do, what to do, what to do.</p>
<p>The reason for this indecisiveness was that I was a father at the time.</p>
<p>My little girl by the name of Chelsea was 18 months old, and I was there when she was</p>
<p>born, I took her to her home, I watched her grow up, I watched her take the first steps,</p>
<p>and always look at me with these big eyes, lovingly look at me, and that is when I started</p>
<p>my reentry into the human race, because I just fell in love with this girl.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when love came back, and it was completely unexpected, and there&rsquo;s a lot of fathers who</p>
<p>understand, particularly fathers of girls who understand what happened there.</p>
<p>I still thought I need to go back because there was probably some danger, but I hadn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>figured out how to take care of the girl, leave her, but maybe she needs to have a good</p>
<p>life and grow up and have a chance, and her mother, she was from South America, she had</p>
<p>a fourth grade education.</p>
<p>That would have not worked very well.</p>
<p>So I played for time.</p>
<p>Obviously I could be sick, I could be in a hospital, there was a precedent where I was</p>
<p>sick where I couldn&rsquo;t communicate for about three weeks, so I just did nothing.</p>
<p>That was on a Monday, on a Thursday was my regular shortwave transmission, I listened,</p>
<p>and they explained a little in a few sentences.</p>
<p>We have reason to believe that the FBI is on your case.</p>
<p>You need to execute the emergency procedure, come home right away.</p>
<p>I still had some time because the radio could be broken or the transmission was bad, or</p>
<p>I still could be in a hospital, right?</p>
<p>So I gave myself some more time, and then something happened where they forced my hand.</p>
<p>And this is the only time that a Soviet agent was anywhere near me on the territory of the</p>
<p>United States.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m waiting for the A train on a dark morning still in Queens, and there&rsquo;s this man, the</p>
<p>short man in a black trench coat comes up to me from my right, and he whispers into</p>
<p>my ears, you got to come back or else you&rsquo;re dead.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imitate the Russian accent, it was a Russian accent.</p>
<p>And it was a pretty strong accent.</p>
<p>The you&rsquo;re dead phrase can have two meanings, and an American would have said, or else you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>busted or else you get arrested or else you&rsquo;re dead is very strong.</p>
<p>So now you have to take it seriously to some degree because I knew that they had a history</p>
<p>of assassinating or at least trying to assassinate defectors.</p>
<p>So that obviously raised the stakes a little bit.</p>
<p>But I just talked myself into believing this was just a bad phrasing.</p>
<p>But at this point, I knew and they knew that we both knew, right?</p>
<p>So there was no more guessing.</p>
<p>He found me, he talked to me, I know.</p>
<p>So now I had to act.</p>
<p>So in the next radiogram, I was asked to execute a dead drop operation where they would give</p>
<p>me money and a passport.</p>
<p>And that was in a park on Staten Island, it was a location that I found and I described.</p>
<p>And I was always praised for my ability to describe spots that are easy to find.</p>
<p>So that was a given.</p>
<p>And the only thing that was different for this operation, they scheduled it for the</p>
<p>dark.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>But it was still no problem because it was in a park and a couple of, about a hundred</p>
<p>yards in by next to a fallen tree would be hard to miss.</p>
<p>So I go to Staten Island and I read the signal that said, I put the container in the drop.</p>
<p>That was the protocol.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a signal that the person who hands over something puts at a spot not too far</p>
<p>from the spot itself.</p>
<p>That means I would go in and just pick it up.</p>
<p>The reason I actually went to pick up this container, because there was money in it.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t have to make a decision yet.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I could throw away the passport.</p>
<p>It was like I was still trying to figure out what to do, what to do, what to do.</p>
<p>So I get to the spot, I get to the tree and I had a flashlight with me that the park,</p>
<p>there was no way in the park.</p>
<p>Even during the day though, this park was not, it was more, almost like a little forest.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t see the container.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be a crushed oil can, pretty sizable, hard to miss.</p>
<p>And I do a double take and I look again and I look around and look around a little more,</p>
<p>see if they misplaced it, can&rsquo;t find it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only one that one of those operations failed.</p>
<p>And that just doesn&rsquo;t make a lot of sense.</p>
<p>So when, as I&rsquo;m walking away from this, like sort of numb emotionally, I said to myself,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m staying.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That decision.</p>
<p>That kind of signal, some kind of a muse just spoke to you.</p>
<p>That decision was made for me.</p>
<p>Now, you know that I&rsquo;m a Christian now and I think that was like, God told me this, you</p>
<p>know.</p>
<p>But it was certain there.</p>
<p>It was right there.</p>
<p>That was it.</p>
<p>And so what I did to, well, first of all, divine intervention helped me to find a good</p>
<p>explanation.</p>
<p>I sent them my last letter with secret writing, I communicated to them, I said, I wish I could</p>
<p>come but I can&rsquo;t because I have contracted HIV AIDS.</p>
<p>That was the best lie ever because nobody wanted to have AIDS in their country.</p>
<p>Those days it was a death sentence, right?</p>
<p>And I knew, we had conversations when I was back in Moscow, how they were snickering about</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on in the United States, that depraved culture and you see, they&rsquo;re killing</p>
<p>each other.</p>
<p>And the depraved culture took over your being and how you&rsquo;re sitting.</p>
<p>And I was convincing enough, I even traced it back to a girlfriend I had once that I</p>
<p>actually reported on that she, I interacted with this lady who had a boyfriend at one</p>
<p>point who was a drug addict and she was infected and she infected me.</p>
<p>So they believed it, they sent and I asked them to give my dollar savings to my German</p>
<p>family.</p>
<p>They gave them some but they told my family that I already passed away, that I&rsquo;m dead.</p>
<p>They believed it, 100%.</p>
<p>And I guess the agent who took the money took half of it for himself.</p>
<p>So that was it.</p>
<p>And the next three months I made sure that I wasn&rsquo;t reliably at the same spot and the</p>
<p>same timeframe.</p>
<p>So I went to work in different paths at different times just to, you know, just as a safety</p>
<p>measure so to speak and not huge but, you know, it kept me, allowed me to keep my sanity.</p>
<p>And obviously after I sent the letter I threw the shortwave radio in the Hudson River, destroyed</p>
<p>the one time paths that I still had.</p>
<p>So I was now ready to for a new life and live out my life as an American undiscovered but,</p>
<p>you know, starting to work on my version of the American dream.</p>
<p>And the first action was, I was telling my wife, the mother of this child, you know,</p>
<p>she always wanted to have a house and said, you know what, we should buy a house.</p>
<p>And a year later we moved into the suburbs and then I said, we should have another child</p>
<p>and we had another child.</p>
<p>So and I had a career where I did pretty well.</p>
<p>I moved a couple of times, wound up in a McMansion.</p>
<p>But before that my second house was actually in Pennsylvania, in rural Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>And this is where I was discovered by the FBI.</p>
<p>And how did they know about me?</p>
<p>If it hadn&rsquo;t been for this defector, Vasily Mitrokhin, who was an archivist in the KGB</p>
<p>archives, he was actually pretty high level.</p>
<p>He was in charge of the relocation of the archive from Lubyanka to Yasenov.</p>
<p>And he really hated, he had reason to believe he hated the Soviet system.</p>
<p>I think I remember that his son was quite ill and he could have gotten treatment in</p>
<p>England and he was not allowed to travel to England with his son.</p>
<p>So his hatred, he tried to figure out what to do and how to do damage to that system.</p>
<p>So he started copying notes, little slips of paper, handwritten that he smuggled out</p>
<p>in his underwear and his socks over the years.</p>
<p>And then he transcribed them with a typewriter and then put the pieces of paper into some</p>
<p>kind of a container and buried this in his stash.</p>
<p>It was, I believe in 1992 when he showed up, that was already the Soviet Union was gone.</p>
<p>So he showed up at the US embassy in Moscow and told him what he had and it was on a weekend</p>
<p>and apparently there was a junior person in charge and he said, you know what, what you</p>
<p>got, we are not interested and it&rsquo;s really old.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a career limiting move, right, because Vasily Mitrokhin then made his way to one</p>
<p>of the Baltic republics and contacted MI6 and they said, come on in, old fellow, have</p>
<p>a cup of tea.</p>
<p>And so they managed to get this stuff out of the Dacha and get it to England and eventually</p>
<p>MI6 shared it with the FBI and there wasn&rsquo;t a whole lot of information about me, it was</p>
<p>very, very little.</p>
<p>It was like, there&rsquo;s a person by the name of Jack Barsky who is an illegal operating</p>
<p>in the northeast of the United States.</p>
<p>Now if it was Jim Miller, they wouldn&rsquo;t have found me, Jack Barsky was easy to find.</p>
<p>So they checked social security and Jack Barsky had gotten his social security card at the</p>
<p>age of 33, bingo, okay.</p>
<p>All they knew though was that I wasn&rsquo;t illegal, that I was still living there, they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know whether I was active, inactive and the other thing that they knew that I was a really,</p>
<p>really well trained agent because I was still there, right.</p>
<p>So they took, I think, almost three years to investigate me, watch me from a distance</p>
<p>because if I was still active, I would have found out that somebody is investigating me.</p>
<p>So you started being less and less active in terms of&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, I stopped completely.</p>
<p>What I mean is&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, surveillance detection.</p>
<p>Yes, surveillance detection.</p>
<p>After three months, I stopped altogether.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, good point.</p>
<p>And FBI is still very careful.</p>
<p>They were very careful.</p>
<p>They pretty much watched me and at one point, I had a house in the country with one neighbor,</p>
<p>at one point that house was for sale, so the FBI bought it and they put a couple of agents</p>
<p>there and just didn&rsquo;t keep a closer eye on me.</p>
<p>There was no indication that I was still active, but they were still cautious but at one point,</p>
<p>they were able to plant a bug in my kitchen, a listening device and my wife and I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get along very well.</p>
<p>There was a lot of friction and she was constantly complaining about things and I got sick and</p>
<p>tired of it and one day we had an argument in the kitchen and I chose to deploy the nuclear</p>
<p>option and that is telling her what I sacrificed to be with her so she would understand that</p>
<p>I am there on her side.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m supporting her.</p>
<p>If something doesn&rsquo;t quite fit, it is not because I don&rsquo;t love the both of them, Chelsea</p>
<p>and Penelope.</p>
<p>So when I said that, the listening device was active, so the FBI was hearing my confession.</p>
<p>I was once a KGB agent, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah and I quit and then stayed here</p>
<p>because of you and Chelsea and that also made it clear to the FBI that I wasn&rsquo;t active</p>
<p>anymore.</p>
<p>They had both of that.</p>
<p>So now they knew an attempt to turn me would have been useless because you turned somebody</p>
<p>who was active, but they figured there was enough reason to treat me nicely because they</p>
<p>figured I had a lot of information that was as aged as it was, but it was still important</p>
<p>for the FBI to get to know.</p>
<p>And so one day, it was a Friday evening, I&rsquo;m driving back home from the office and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>being stopped by a state police.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m going through the toll, it&rsquo;s a bridge over the Hudson and they had to pay a toll</p>
<p>and he waved me, he got me right where I stopped and he said, could you please move over here?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a routine traffic stop and I thought nothing of it.</p>
<p>I had forgotten at that point that I once was a spy, it was gone.</p>
<p>And then he said, could you please step out of the car?</p>
<p>That should have aroused my suspicion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s unusual, right?</p>
<p>Routine traffic stop.</p>
<p>Yeah, I did it, no problem.</p>
<p>And then again, somebody came from the right, came into my view and he flipped his ID and</p>
<p>he said, FBI, we would like to have a talk with you.</p>
<p>This is my now friend, Joe Riley, who actually is the, he&rsquo;s the godfather of Trinity and</p>
<p>my last child.</p>
<p>Anyway, he told me later that when I heard that phrase, all the blood left my face, I</p>
<p>became totally white.</p>
<p>But I recovered very quickly and he said it himself, so they took me to a vehicle and</p>
<p>there was another agent in the vehicle and he had a gun strapped to his ankle, so it</p>
<p>was pretty real.</p>
<p>First question I had, so am I under arrest?</p>
<p>And the answer was no.</p>
<p>And then my instinct kicked in and my ability to operate very well under high pressure situations.</p>
<p>And I asked him, so what took you so long?</p>
<p>You know, the intent of that was to defuse any kind of tension.</p>
<p>And I saw a smile.</p>
<p>Instant friends.</p>
<p>Yeah, I knew that I had to make them like me and I&rsquo;m, I think by now I know I&rsquo;m a pretty</p>
<p>likable person.</p>
<p>And I, when they took me to a motel, which they had rented, there was two wings at a</p>
<p>right angle, they bought all the rooms in one wing and they had a guard at each end</p>
<p>of that wing and they took me in the middle and there were some props there, some binders</p>
<p>with labels and I immediately thought, this is pretty silly because what I noticed that</p>
<p>the labels all referred back to my early years.</p>
<p>I knew that they didn&rsquo;t know much else.</p>
<p>So I told Joe that afterwards and that was not a great idea, but anyway.</p>
<p>But I volunteered.</p>
<p>I made the following statement before we even started the interview.</p>
<p>I said, I know there&rsquo;s only one way for me to, and my family, to have a chance to get</p>
<p>through here without much damages if I&rsquo;m completely 100% cooperative and it&rsquo;s my intent to do</p>
<p>exactly that.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So we spent about two hours in the interview.</p>
<p>They allowed me to call my wife, tell her that I&rsquo;m going to be late.</p>
<p>That indicated to me already that they would let me go.</p>
<p>And after two hours they let me go.</p>
<p>But they had the area covered with a whole bunch of people.</p>
<p>And the head of that team talked to me and he said, if you think of running, we got every</p>
<p>intersection in this area covered.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say anything, but you know, I had no thought of running.</p>
<p>So and that was the beginning of another phase of my life where I was cooperating with the</p>
<p>FBI for quite a while and living still undercover for several years until I had real good documentation</p>
<p>and became an American citizen seven years ago.</p>
<p>From today, seven years ago.</p>
<p>So recently.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Quite recent.</p>
<p>The hypocrisy took a long time to figure out how to make me real and also not put me in</p>
<p>these witness protection program, you know, to keep my name and then just, you know, make</p>
<p>everything like official.</p>
<p>So for instance, I had to change my birth year simply because if I, Jack Barsky was</p>
<p>born in 1944, if I kept 1944, the FBI would have helped me commit a crime because I would</p>
<p>have collected social security four years sooner.</p>
<p>So anyway, yes, it took quite a while.</p>
<p>And when I finally got the call from the office of Homeland Security, the lady says, this</p>
<p>is agent so and so from Homeland Security, can you come into the office tomorrow?</p>
<p>And I said, let me look at my calendar.</p>
<p>And then I said, wait a minute, what am I talking about?</p>
<p>What time do you want me to be there?</p>
<p>Because I had waited for that moment for a long time.</p>
<p>And I was sworn in right then and there.</p>
<p>It was a good feeling to walk out of there because I had a country again, you know, and</p>
<p>I love this country just as much as you said you love it with all its warts and its problems</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going through right now.</p>
<p>And then the last thing that changed my life again, and I don&rsquo;t want to get into details</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a little complicated story, I never wanted to be a public person.</p>
<p>And then I was discovered through a number of dots that were unlikely to be connected.</p>
<p>It had to do with a relative, with a half brother of my wife who lives in Germany, was</p>
<p>taken to Germany by his mother who came to visit somebody, not us, but that somebody</p>
<p>that he came to visit lived 50 miles from our house and that my wife and this half brother</p>
<p>never met in person before.</p>
<p>They knew about each other through social media.</p>
<p>And when he found out my background, he was a conductor of the German railroad at the</p>
<p>time, he said, oh, this is a big story and that&rsquo;s going to be big, big, big, okay.</p>
<p>Well he happened to know this one person who happened to know one of the star reporters</p>
<p>of Der Spiegel and after she did some research and determined that I was real, she was on</p>
<p>my case.</p>
<p>And she happened to know Steve Croft, the guy from 60 Minutes, you see all these connections?</p>
<p>I had nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how life works, dots get connected somehow, sometimes, for most of us it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Stuff happens.</p>
<p>You get lucky.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve gotten lucky a few times in your life.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I must be part Irish too.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s been an interesting ride.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just still shaking my head about all the stuff that happened.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a fun one.</p>
<p>But you wrote, because I&rsquo;m allowed to leave behind a documented legacy of my unusual life,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m praying that the legacy will be described by a single word, love.</p>
<p>So let us return to the thing we started the conversation with, which is love.</p>
<p>What role does love play in this human condition, in your life and in our life here together?</p>
<p>I give you an answer by telling you what happened one day.</p>
<p>I gave a presentation at Microsoft headquarters.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a strange beginning of a love story, but yes.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not a love story.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s this beautiful young lady sitting in the back, and she&rsquo;s paying a lot of attention.</p>
<p>Turned out later that her job at Microsoft, her job title was storyteller.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s soft marketing, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, you could say that.</p>
<p>But if you can&rsquo;t afford somebody like that, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Anyway, question and answer, she raised her hand and she asked me, so all the things that</p>
<p>you have done and you have experienced, what&rsquo;s the number one lesson you&rsquo;ve taken away from</p>
<p>your life?</p>
<p>That was a new question for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been asked that question.</p>
<p>And I thought about it for 20 seconds, and then I came up with this phrase that we all</p>
<p>know, love conquers all, because in my life it did, in the end.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the strongest human emotion, and that is what makes us human, really.</p>
<p>And you spoke about the, I mean, offline as I&rsquo;ve spoken with you, it&rsquo;s clear to me how</p>
<p>transformative, how powerful the life of your children are, your daughters in your life,</p>
<p>and who you are, and why you think life is beautiful, and why you think this country</p>
<p>is beautiful.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;m pretty mature, to put it mildly, I&rsquo;m also more loving towards many more people.</p>
<p>These things like random acts of kindness for strangers, I do them, I&rsquo;m looking for</p>
<p>them now.</p>
<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good for me.</p>
<p>Well, welcome to Texas, because this random acts of kindness to strangers seems to be</p>
<p>a way of life, which is one of the reasons I love it here.</p>
<p>It just reminds me why I love human beings, is that there&rsquo;s just this warmth, this connection.</p>
<p>Yeah, and Georgia is the same thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
<p>Do you have any regrets?</p>
<p>Looking back at life, do you wish you&rsquo;d done something different?</p>
<p>I could have, but then I would have a different regret.</p>
<p>I betrayed the wife, the German wife that I loved.</p>
<p>I really did love her, and I betrayed her.</p>
<p>But if I don&rsquo;t betray her, then I betray the child.</p>
<p>That is a source of so much love for you now.</p>
<p>So maybe life is a kind of, you get to choose your regrets.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get to avoid them.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a little bit of a strange way of putting it, but there&rsquo;s no other choice.</p>
<p>I tell you what I don&rsquo;t regret, and that may be, you probably understand it now because</p>
<p>you have enough background about me, I don&rsquo;t regret having lied to my mother.</p>
<p>Because I had no really strong emotional relationship with her.</p>
<p>She took care of me, she was proud of me, but we didn&rsquo;t hug, we didn&rsquo;t interact emotionally</p>
<p>whatsoever.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t feel like you betrayed that love that‚Äî</p>
<p>Well I did, I know that she was looking for me until the day she died.</p>
<p>She wrote a letter to President Gorbachev asking him for help to locate me.</p>
<p>She checked with Astazi, she just was hell bent on finding me and couldn&rsquo;t find me,</p>
<p>so she passed away without knowing what happened to me.</p>
<p>Now there was this rumor that was flying around, and she possibly may have bought into that</p>
<p>rumor because my cover for when I went to the United States was that I changed careers</p>
<p>again and I joined an institution in Kazakhstan that did space research, intercosmos something</p>
<p>something, and I had a piece of paper that invited me to start there, and it was a forgery.</p>
<p>It never existed, but people knew that in Kazakhstan there were super secret facilities.</p>
<p>One of my classmates, old classmates from high school started the rumor that I died</p>
<p>in a rocket accident, and everybody knew that.</p>
<p>So when I came back to Germany, I found the telephone number of this girl that had dumped</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>I called her, and I said, so guess who this is?</p>
<p>Maybe you hold on to your chair, she says yes, I said, this is Albrecht.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good payback.</p>
<p>No, we actually met.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s two elderly people in their 60s who meet each other after so many years, and</p>
<p>the one that ended the relationship started the conversation by saying, you know what,</p>
<p>I made a really bad mistake, and the tears came down her cheeks.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t asking for that.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t happy about it, but it did feel good.</p>
<p>Now a while later, I knew why she said she made a mistake.</p>
<p>I met her husband.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s a, Tom Waits has a song called Martha, where an older gentleman calls</p>
<p>somebody he used to love, and they have a conversation.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both married now, and sometimes you can meet people from your past, and it gives</p>
<p>you a glimpse of a possible different life you could have had.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and you know, I was actually, when she said I made a mistake, and I was thinking</p>
<p>to myself, no, you didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>There was none.</p>
<p>There was nothing left.</p>
<p>Also the person that she became, personality wise, wasn&rsquo;t as attractive as I remembered</p>
<p>her.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s puppy love.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still love, and it still happened.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was.</p>
<p>It was passionate love for sure, and I would have thrown myself under the bus if I could</p>
<p>save her.</p>
<p>It was that strong, and it&rsquo;s just as strong as the love for my two girls.</p>
<p>Life is full of moments and periods like that of love, and that&rsquo;s what makes life so freaking</p>
<p>awesome.</p>
<p>But it does come to an end.</p>
<p>And so does this conversation, I guess.</p>
<p>This goes on for many more hours, but yes, do you think about your own death?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Do you think about death?</p>
<p>Do you think about your own death?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Are you afraid of it?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Even though I&rsquo;m a Christian.</p>
<p>As a Christian, do you have a sense what&rsquo;s coming after, or is it full of uncertainty?</p>
<p>I have a hope.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a lot of Christianity which is quite logical, a lot of Christianity which</p>
<p>is also the life of Christ, there&rsquo;s a lot of proof.</p>
<p>But I became a Christian starting with a head, and I was already quite old.</p>
<p>When you don&rsquo;t get this faith very early, it&rsquo;s tougher to buy into everything.</p>
<p>You know, there are some things that are difficult for me to understand and believe, but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>many, many other things that I can&rsquo;t explain only with the existence of a God, but whether</p>
<p>He lets us go again for an eternity, I just hope.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t convince somebody else at this point, which doesn&rsquo;t make me a really, really good</p>
<p>Christian because I&rsquo;m supposed to evangelize.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s still a fear.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fear and a hope.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I know that, you see, this is how I approach the last years of my life.</p>
<p>I will not mentally or physically get decrepit.</p>
<p>I will do everything I can do to be alert and fit.</p>
<p>I still run.</p>
<p>I run four or five times a week, and I&rsquo;m going to start lifting weights again.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>You stay physically and mentally sharp.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Go out with guns blazing.</p>
<p>I once read a book written by a medical doctor, he said, most people, when they&rsquo;re becoming</p>
<p>mature, the rest of their life is a slow downward move.</p>
<p>Not for you.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The last years are pretty bad.</p>
<p>He said, you got to do this, boom.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty good advice from a doctor.</p>
<p>If nothing else from Christianity, whichever parts you take on, one of the big ones is</p>
<p>love.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;ve lived from the very beginning before God was part of your life,</p>
<p>before anything was part of your life.</p>
<p>It seemed that love was part of your life and has been a consistent thread throughout.</p>
<p>Yes, sir.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a short sentence in the Bible that says, God is love.</p>
<p>The other thing I want to say, the Christian morality is, I can sign that with my blood.</p>
<p>God is love.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
<p>Jack, you&rsquo;re an incredible person, lived an incredible life.</p>
<p>Thank you for talking today.</p>
<p>Thank you for telling your story.</p>
<p>Thank you for being who you are, and thank you for being all about love.</p>
<p>This is a beautiful conversation, it was an honor.</p>
<p>Thank you for talking today.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I appreciate the tough questions that you asked.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jack Barsky.</p>

<p>And now, let me leave you with some words from Edward Snowden.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t come up against the world&rsquo;s most powerful intelligence agencies and not accept</p>
<p>the risk.</p>
<p>If they want to get you, over time, they will.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
