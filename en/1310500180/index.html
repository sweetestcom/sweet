    <p>The following is a conversation with Robert Breedlove,</p>
<p>someone who caught my attention</p>
<p>and was recommended highly as a rigorous scholar</p>
<p>and thinker in the space of decentralized finance</p>
<p>and Bitcoin.</p>
<p>His podcast titled What is Money?</p>
<p>is a good representation of the way his mind works.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s willing to talk through ideas for many hours,</p>
<p>willing to listen, willing to think,</p>
<p>which makes him a great companion in conversation</p>
<p>to explore the history, philosophy, and future of money.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors,</p>
<p>Fundrise, Element, MonkPak, and BetterHelp.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that I&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>a number of conversations in the coming months</p>
<p>on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>None of these conversations are financial advice.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a legal warning, that&rsquo;s a genuine description</p>
<p>of my goals and approach with these chats.</p>
<p>At least for a while, I personally won&rsquo;t actively invest</p>
<p>in Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies,</p>
<p>except to learn about the technology itself.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this should be a journalistic standard</p>
<p>like the New York Times trying to establish,</p>
<p>which I very much disagree with.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, I think journalists should be free</p>
<p>to invest in Bitcoin if they want to.</p>
<p>Luckily, I&rsquo;m not a journalist.</p>
<p>I just know my own psychology and I feel that my thinking</p>
<p>will be muddled by excitement</p>
<p>if I invest before I understand.</p>
<p>I feel the same way about Tesla, for example.</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t own any Tesla stock</p>
<p>and I am still indeed fascinated by Tesla Autopilot</p>
<p>as an artificial intelligence system.</p>
<p>I work hard to be cognizant of the biases</p>
<p>that arise in my mind and always try to choose the path</p>
<p>that maximizes or maintains a freedom of thought</p>
<p>as much as possible.</p>
<p>Also, let me say that I try to be very careful</p>
<p>in selecting guests based not only on the contents</p>
<p>of their ideas, but the richness, complexity, music,</p>
<p>style of their mind and character.</p>
<p>Yes, I will talk with people with whom you</p>
<p>and I may disagree, people who some may call bad</p>
<p>or even evil human beings.</p>
<p>I want to understand them because I believe that,</p>
<p>as Solzhenitsyn said, the battle line between good and evil</p>
<p>runs through the heart of every man.</p>
<p>I think if you always run from evil,</p>
<p>you become blind to the truth of human nature.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast</p>
<p>and here is my conversation with Robert Breedlove.</p>
<p>Rousseau opens his 1762 book, The Social Contract,</p>
<p>with the following statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Man is born free and everywhere he is in chains.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>So you talk about freedom and sovereignty quite a bit.</p>
<p>What do these ideas mean to you, the idea of sovereignty?</p>
<p>Freedom and sovereignty, I think they&rsquo;re very</p>
<p>closely related.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start just focusing on sovereignty,</p>
<p>which is a word I don&rsquo;t think we talk about enough.</p>
<p>And the general definition of that I would give</p>
<p>is the authority to act as you see fit.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a word that&rsquo;s etymologically associated</p>
<p>with words like monarchy, money, reign.</p>
<p>So historically, it&rsquo;s referred to whatever the locus</p>
<p>of supreme power is in the sphere of human action.</p>
<p>So whether, if you go like back into ancient Egypt,</p>
<p>the Pharaoh had absolute sovereignty</p>
<p>and everyone else was pretty much operating</p>
<p>according to his interests.</p>
<p>You fast forward to today, modern Western democracy,</p>
<p>we have more decentralized sovereignty</p>
<p>and that we all get to go vote and elect officials</p>
<p>that make decisions on our behalf.</p>
<p>So the theme of sovereignty across history</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s been gradually decentralizing</p>
<p>across our different models of socioeconomics.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s largely, you could say it&rsquo;s rooted heavily</p>
<p>in the money, I would argue,</p>
<p>which is something we&rsquo;ll get a lot into here,</p>
<p>where if you have money, you have the authority</p>
<p>to act as you see fit in the world.</p>
<p>And even in our current political sphere,</p>
<p>if you have enough money, you can actually reshape the rules.</p>
<p>You can reshape laws, you can lobby Congress.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in a certain situation, like many billionaires,</p>
<p>you can negotiate your own tax treaty</p>
<p>such that you can get favorable tax treatment</p>
<p>with certain jurisdictions in the world.</p>
<p>So this concept of sovereignty, which today we call,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s common to call states or nation states</p>
<p>or government sovereign,</p>
<p>meaning that they have power over people.</p>
<p>But as I argue in a lot of my writing,</p>
<p>I actually think that sovereignty</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s within the individual</p>
<p>and that we each have our own interiorized space of choice,</p>
<p>which is something like Victor Frankl</p>
<p>called the final human freedom.</p>
<p>And that we, no matter what our circumstances are,</p>
<p>no matter what exogenous situation we face,</p>
<p>we always have this endogenous power</p>
<p>to choose how we respond to it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of my favorite books is,</p>
<p>A Man&rsquo;s Search for Meaning.</p>
<p>Maybe we can break that apart a little bit.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve kind of spoken about sovereignty</p>
<p>as a closely linked to power,</p>
<p>but is there something about your own mind</p>
<p>being able to achieve sovereignty</p>
<p>no matter what the monetary system is,</p>
<p>no matter what, who has the control over centralized power,</p>
<p>the money or whatever the mechanisms of sovereignty</p>
<p>and the societal level?</p>
<p>You as an individual, isn&rsquo;t ultimately all boiled down</p>
<p>to what you can do with your mind, how you see the world?</p>
<p>How you interpret it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>And as we get a little bit deeper into this,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll come to see money</p>
<p>as an extension of your mind.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a feedback between money and mind.</p>
<p>For instance, you think in dollars today,</p>
<p>almost guarantee it, most of us do here in the US.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a tool, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tool we&rsquo;re using to decomplexify the world around us,</p>
<p>to deal with it, to understand the sacrifices and successes</p>
<p>across an entire history of economic transactions.</p>
<p>We can boil that all down to the price.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s data compression.</p>
<p>And if you can change,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a central body or central governance mechanism</p>
<p>that can manipulate that money,</p>
<p>it can have an impact on your mind.</p>
<p>For instance, today, so I agree with you on the first hand,</p>
<p>say that I do believe in free will.</p>
<p>I do believe in individual autonomy,</p>
<p>but I also think that there are certain devices and powers</p>
<p>in the world around us</p>
<p>that can actually influence how we think.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fascinating to think about the fact</p>
<p>that money might be actually deeply integrated</p>
<p>into the way we think and into our mind.</p>
<p>You think about what are the core aspects of the human mind?</p>
<p>What influences cognition,</p>
<p>the way you reason about the world?</p>
<p>You have the Chomsky languages at the core of everything,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re kind of placing money as pretty close</p>
<p>to the core of what it means</p>
<p>to be an intelligent reasoning human.</p>
<p>I think money is a direct derivation</p>
<p>of action and speech, actually.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another expression of the logos.</p>
<p>If we even think of what it means to think</p>
<p>is that we are generating two different courses of action,</p>
<p>potential courses of action,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re populating them with avatars, right?</p>
<p>Maybe ourselves or others.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re comparing how we may act in each situation</p>
<p>and what we think the result would be.</p>
<p>So actually it&rsquo;s comparison.</p>
<p>Basically it&rsquo;s comparison and contrasting</p>
<p>of possible courses of action.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the same thing with words themselves.</p>
<p>Most words, the vast majority of words</p>
<p>only have meaning in relationship to other words, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all contextual definitions of a word or more words.</p>
<p>Now people have argued with me about this</p>
<p>because there is a first word, right?</p>
<p>Where you pick up rock and say rock.</p>
<p>But most other words in higher abstraction</p>
<p>tend to be relative.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s funny about action and speech,</p>
<p>and this gets, I got into a bit of this in our paper here,</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s linked to evolutionary biology</p>
<p>and that once human beings adopted upright stance,</p>
<p>we freed our hands.</p>
<p>We no longer needed our hands for locomotion.</p>
<p>So we started to evolve more dexterity</p>
<p>and notably we have opposable thumbs.</p>
<p>So this gives us an ability to manipulate</p>
<p>and particularize the environment</p>
<p>in a way that most other animals cannot.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting about this is that</p>
<p>as we gain this ability to manipulate natural resources</p>
<p>and count, point, pointing was a big deal</p>
<p>and that we could indicate prey</p>
<p>or items that are far off distance</p>
<p>and we could organize ourselves.</p>
<p>At the same time we co evolved this fine musculature</p>
<p>in the face and tongue.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s as if speech developed,</p>
<p>co evolved really with our dexterity.</p>
<p>And as a natural extension of that came us making tools.</p>
<p>Right, we started to create things</p>
<p>to better satisfy our wants over time.</p>
<p>And the most tradable tool in any society</p>
<p>or the most tradable thing is money.</p>
<p>So I really, I argue that action and speech</p>
<p>are quintessential modes of self sovereign expression.</p>
<p>And the money is just sort of a tech layer</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve put right on top of that.</p>
<p>And that it&rsquo;s a natural derivation of action and speech.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s fascinating to think about sovereignty</p>
<p>from the evolutionary perspective.</p>
<p>And then ultimately money is the technology layer</p>
<p>that enables sovereignty.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s really fascinating to think about</p>
<p>our modern human society as deeply rooted</p>
<p>in these like evolutionary roots</p>
<p>from the very origins of life on earth.</p>
<p>So what, you know, some of the ideas you just mentioned,</p>
<p>what do you see are some interesting characteristics</p>
<p>of just life on earth that propagated to us humans?</p>
<p>Like what ideas propagated through,</p>
<p>have roots in the evolution?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think one of the deepest impulsions in life</p>
<p>is the territorial imperative.</p>
<p>So all life is seeking to expand its dominion</p>
<p>over space and time.</p>
<p>And we think about, you know, again, physically with space,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s advantageous to an animal or an organism</p>
<p>to have more territory under its control</p>
<p>to raise offspring.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all about reproductive fitness</p>
<p>at the end of the day.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;d also think of reproduction itself</p>
<p>as the genetic impulse to have more,</p>
<p>to replicate oneself across time.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s territoriality across time in a way.</p>
<p>And this is very common in most animals.</p>
<p>Not all animals are territorial, but many are.</p>
<p>And you see very interesting behaviors</p>
<p>resulting from territoriality.</p>
<p>This is like animal combat.</p>
<p>You know, the reason birds sing is territoriality,</p>
<p>a number of other things.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s my hypothesis and others have shared</p>
<p>this hypothesis as well, that mankind is clearly,</p>
<p>I think, would argue a territorial species</p>
<p>and that he expresses this territoriality in property rights.</p>
<p>So property, when we hear that word,</p>
<p>we typically think of an asset.</p>
<p>We think of, oh, this house or this stock or whatever.</p>
<p>But property is actually the socially acknowledged</p>
<p>relationship between a human and an asset,</p>
<p>such that you have exclusive rights and responsibilities</p>
<p>to a particular asset.</p>
<p>It is not the asset itself.</p>
<p>So property, it&rsquo;s information, it&rsquo;s a relationship.</p>
<p>By the way, my mind was just blown.</p>
<p>Property is information, it&rsquo;s not the actual asset.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>Very important.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then it comes down to how do we organize ourselves</p>
<p>such that property, that the contributions people are making</p>
<p>are commensurate with the consideration they&rsquo;re receiving.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re adding value to a piece of property,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re developing a piece of land for use,</p>
<p>in theory, to be fair, you should have the rights</p>
<p>to that fruit if you go out and plant a garden</p>
<p>or whatever it may be.</p>
<p>And this is rooted in natural law,</p>
<p>where we have rights to life, liberty, and property.</p>
<p>Those are kind of just the base,</p>
<p>the fundamental layer of morality and capitalism, frankly.</p>
<p>And you could think of, to get really primordial with it,</p>
<p>the first capitalist in the world,</p>
<p>just to kind of get some definitions out here,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say capitalism versus communism or socialism</p>
<p>as the spectrum I&rsquo;ll speak on.</p>
<p>The first capitalist in the world would be the guy,</p>
<p>the caveman, that maybe dug a little hole for himself</p>
<p>to shield himself from the elements.</p>
<p>Maybe there was a rainstorm or a snowstorm</p>
<p>and he dug a little enclave and he protected himself.</p>
<p>I thought you were gonna go, because you said primordial,</p>
<p>I thought you were gonna go back to like</p>
<p>earlier biological systems.</p>
<p>I guess primordial for human, perhaps.</p>
<p>For humans, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And then the first communist or socialist</p>
<p>would be someone that decided the fruits of his labor</p>
<p>belonged to him.</p>
<p>So he would have violently encroached on that individual</p>
<p>and taken his plot for himself, for his own use.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the spectrum across which capitalism,</p>
<p>in the pure sense, and communism in the pure sense operate</p>
<p>in that capitalism, each individual has the exclusive rights</p>
<p>to the fruits of their labor.</p>
<p>So anything they spend their time, effort, energy</p>
<p>creating in the world, they own the rights to that</p>
<p>and they can trade those rights with others,</p>
<p>other self owned people that have done similar things.</p>
<p>Communism or socialism would imply that other people,</p>
<p>typically the state, have the rights,</p>
<p>at least some rights to the value you&rsquo;ve created.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this interesting moment when that first caveman,</p>
<p>that first capitalist drew a line, a circle in this cave</p>
<p>and said, you know, this is mine.</p>
<p>You could say it was free to be claimed</p>
<p>at the time he claimed it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s an interesting moment when asset becomes an asset.</p>
<p>When space time, as you were referring to it,</p>
<p>becomes something that&rsquo;s now can be possessed</p>
<p>by a human being.</p>
<p>Is there something special about this moment?</p>
<p>Because it feels like, first of all,</p>
<p>in terms of space and time, it feels like there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of available space time yet to be claimed.</p>
<p>So if we just look at like the universe, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about, there&rsquo;s a funny thing</p>
<p>with Elon Musk and Mars, I think they sneaked in there</p>
<p>for SpaceX, that nobody on earth has any authority</p>
<p>on Mars or any, this is a very interesting question.</p>
<p>It seems almost like humorous at this time,</p>
<p>but perhaps not, perhaps there&rsquo;ll be sections of space,</p>
<p>not just on planets that are gonna be even fought over.</p>
<p>So is there something special about this moment?</p>
<p>Because in discussing sort of violence</p>
<p>and respect for property, it feels like this is</p>
<p>a special moment because ultimately conflict arises</p>
<p>when you make claims on a particular territory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always in conflict where people say,</p>
<p>when you look at Hitler or something, for example,</p>
<p>his claim would be in many of the lands that he attacked</p>
<p>and invaded that this is ultimately,</p>
<p>this has always belonged to Germany.</p>
<p>So is there something you could say as to like</p>
<p>what it means to own an asset or a property?</p>
<p>Yeah, so in the ancient days of hunters and gatherers,</p>
<p>we could say that property was mostly a loyal title,</p>
<p>which meant it&rsquo;s just whatever you can defend, right?</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve got knives and daggers and satchels</p>
<p>and maybe some pelts you&rsquo;ve hunted,</p>
<p>whatever you can hold and defend is yours.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s not like, there&rsquo;s a government to appeal to,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just sort of a free agent operating in the wild,</p>
<p>defending the assets you can protect on you more or less.</p>
<p>And what really changed the nature of property</p>
<p>is when we get into the agricultural age.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a big flip where we went from just foraging</p>
<p>and hunting all the time, constantly moving,</p>
<p>trying to stay alive to deciding we&rsquo;re gonna settle here.</p>
<p>We figured out how to cultivate crops.</p>
<p>We can create, we can increase the population</p>
<p>because we can harvest more energy from the sun</p>
<p>and we can establish a longer term civilization.</p>
<p>What happens in that transition</p>
<p>is that we begin creating economic surplus.</p>
<p>So for the first time in history,</p>
<p>we have stock houses of grain to defend</p>
<p>or maybe meat or cattle or whatever it is we&rsquo;re creating,</p>
<p>we now have savings.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s at that time when government emerges as well,</p>
<p>because once you have savings</p>
<p>or you have an economic surplus,</p>
<p>you have something that other people want to steal, right?</p>
<p>This one thing we&rsquo;ll touch on a lot today</p>
<p>is people always want something for nothing.</p>
<p>People are always seeking the path</p>
<p>to get something for nothing.</p>
<p>And I think that drives a lot of our decision making.</p>
<p>And it actually encourages us to be innovative</p>
<p>in a lot of ways, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to, you could say it&rsquo;s our laziness</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s helping us be inventive in a way.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to accomplish greater results</p>
<p>with less efforts over time,</p>
<p>but we can cross that line in seeking something for nothing</p>
<p>where we start to violate the life, liberty,</p>
<p>and property of others.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where we shift from kind of capitalistic society</p>
<p>to something more communistic.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what government is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a protection producing enterprise</p>
<p>for the economic surplus generated by a trading society.</p>
<p>So when people begin to trade,</p>
<p>they create what&rsquo;s called the division of labor,</p>
<p>which is a very common economic term,</p>
<p>basically means you&rsquo;re better at making hats,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m better at making boots.</p>
<p>If you specialize in hats, I specialize in boots,</p>
<p>and we trade, we&rsquo;ve created a positive sum game</p>
<p>where you and I both benefit.</p>
<p>So we become collectively more than the sum of our parts</p>
<p>through trade.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why human beings do trade</p>
<p>because we become more energy efficient as a result.</p>
<p>We create more outputs per unit of input.</p>
<p>And you can think of government in that respect,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re looking at it maybe in a tech sense</p>
<p>that the economy is the trade network that generates wealth,</p>
<p>generates innovation, generates all,</p>
<p>this whole lap of luxury we live in today</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve inherited from our forebears is from the market.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not from a government.</p>
<p>The government is the network security, if you will.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re paying expenses to a vendor to protect peace,</p>
<p>to preserve life, liberty, and property in that network</p>
<p>so that we can have, you know,</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s inevitably disputes over private property,</p>
<p>we can have nonviolent dispute resolution</p>
<p>in the rule of law.</p>
<p>And we can have a reasonable expectation</p>
<p>of being able to conduct commerce without violence.</p>
<p>The problem has been that the protector tends to,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;re in a monopolistic position, we would say.</p>
<p>They tend to start abusing that position</p>
<p>to obtain property for themselves.</p>
<p>Again, trying to get that something for nothing.</p>
<p>When you control, you know, you are the security guard</p>
<p>for the economy.</p>
<p>The first thing they tend to monopolize is money</p>
<p>because if you can control the money,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re effectively controlling people, their energy,</p>
<p>their perceptions.</p>
<p>And that becomes a, you know,</p>
<p>particularly through inflation,</p>
<p>becomes an avenue to get something for nothing</p>
<p>and that you can just print more money</p>
<p>that everyone else is forced to sacrifice their time</p>
<p>and energy to obtain.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about anarchism?</p>
<p>So I talk quite a bit, he&rsquo;ll be here in a few days,</p>
<p>actually, Michael Malice, about ideas of anarchy.</p>
<p>And his idea or the idea of anarchists</p>
<p>is that any amount of government will eventually become</p>
<p>the very kind of thing that you&rsquo;re referring to.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s almost no way to have a government</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t then try to monopolize power,</p>
<p>money, and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible to have a government</p>
<p>sort of on that spectrum of like anarchy,</p>
<p>maybe libertarianism,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how exactly the spectrum goes,</p>
<p>but where you have a small government</p>
<p>that protects the liberty and property rights</p>
<p>and those kinds of things and doesn&rsquo;t expand</p>
<p>to then also control the monetary system</p>
<p>and all those other things?</p>
<p>Is it possible?</p>
<p>Agreed completely, it was not possible until Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>
<p>So for the first time in history,</p>
<p>we have a money that cannot be monopolized,</p>
<p>cannot be corrupted, cannot be changed,</p>
<p>cannot be weaponized, frankly.</p>
<p>Our current monetary system is weaponized</p>
<p>by those who can print money against those who cannot.</p>
<p>And I think when you have,</p>
<p>at the heart of every modern economy,</p>
<p>which even we could say the US,</p>
<p>we pride ourselves as free market capitalists.</p>
<p>You know, we out competed communism in the 20th century.</p>
<p>We think that this is the superior model.</p>
<p>Most business people will tell you</p>
<p>that the free market is the best allocator of resources,</p>
<p>all of these things.</p>
<p>But what we have at the heart of every modern economy,</p>
<p>including the US, is an anti capitalistic institution,</p>
<p>which is the central bank.</p>
<p>The temptation to monopolize money</p>
<p>throughout all of history has been too strong</p>
<p>for anyone to resist.</p>
<p>So any, even benevolent, quote unquote,</p>
<p>dictators that have taken over,</p>
<p>many dictators have inherited, say,</p>
<p>an inflationary regime where society is coming apart</p>
<p>because someone was clipping the coins</p>
<p>or someone was printing too much money,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll commit to going back to a hard money standard.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll keep society on a gold standard, for instance,</p>
<p>such that they cannot violate the money</p>
<p>to benefit themselves.</p>
<p>But inevitably, over time, because it is</p>
<p>a political institution, there&rsquo;s an incentive there, right?</p>
<p>For, again, to get something for nothing,</p>
<p>to spend more than you&rsquo;re making through tax revenues.</p>
<p>And with that incentive, people typically,</p>
<p>ultimately end up pursuing that inflationary path.</p>
<p>So we can get deeper into that about,</p>
<p>inflation is a term that we&rsquo;ve been conditioned</p>
<p>to think today is just something normal.</p>
<p>The prices just go up, and then it&rsquo;s pertinent</p>
<p>to a healthy economy, but it&rsquo;s actually,</p>
<p>if you look at it from real first principles,</p>
<p>it is just theft integrated into the money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a technology backdoor,</p>
<p>is another way to think about it.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t buy a cell phone knowing</p>
<p>that someone could siphon your data off your private calls</p>
<p>and sell it into the market.</p>
<p>Now, I know we do that with a lot of social media stuff</p>
<p>today, and that&rsquo;s something else we can get into,</p>
<p>but you wouldn&rsquo;t do it willingly, right?</p>
<p>You prefer that your cell phone and your data</p>
<p>was monetized by you, or if you&rsquo;re gonna sell it,</p>
<p>you would be able to selectively sell it.</p>
<p>Inflation is that it&rsquo;s similar, it&rsquo;s a tech backdoor.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a money that only a few people</p>
<p>can siphon value off of surreptitiously, typically slowly,</p>
<p>but eventually, as we&rsquo;ve seen throughout history,</p>
<p>that slowly builds up into a rapidly</p>
<p>and then causes the monetary system to collapse.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a benefit to inflation, possibly?</p>
<p>So when you have perfect information,</p>
<p>perhaps you don&rsquo;t need inflation,</p>
<p>perhaps it is purely theft, but I think of inflation</p>
<p>as like the snooze button on the alarm.</p>
<p>So if you have a hard standard,</p>
<p>you better wake up when the alarm rings,</p>
<p>but all of us kind of like probably shouldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but use the snooze button.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, well, five more minutes</p>
<p>or 10 more minutes, and then you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s naturally a slippery slope</p>
<p>where it becomes a drug that you fall in love with</p>
<p>and you abuse, but nevertheless,</p>
<p>the usefulness of the snooze button</p>
<p>is that you don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;ll be actually feeling</p>
<p>when the alarm rings.</p>
<p>You might be able to ready to pop up.</p>
<p>It might be like you really need those few more minutes</p>
<p>to psychologically get yourself out of bed.</p>
<p>This metaphor is just not working at all,</p>
<p>but do you think there&rsquo;s a use to inflation sometimes</p>
<p>from like an economics perspective?</p>
<p>I think the drug metaphor is a little more apt</p>
<p>in that inflation does provide</p>
<p>an immediately stimulative effect when used early on.</p>
<p>But what it&rsquo;s doing is it&rsquo;s, again,</p>
<p>we talk about the balance between incentives</p>
<p>and disincentives, right?</p>
<p>That being necessary for a system to function properly.</p>
<p>With inflation, you&rsquo;re essentially giving the people</p>
<p>that can print money a way to dampen</p>
<p>the disincentives they face.</p>
<p>So it destroys feedback loops, I guess you might say.</p>
<p>And another way to look at this is when you,</p>
<p>so using inflation, using quantitative easing,</p>
<p>you can decrease short term volatility in the marketplace.</p>
<p>So the market is basically this idea,</p>
<p>this form of free exchange that&rsquo;s trying to zero in</p>
<p>on the best ideas.</p>
<p>And the ideas are those that are most fit to reality,</p>
<p>to satisfying the most wants.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna overshoot, it&rsquo;s gonna undershoot,</p>
<p>you have these little business cycles.</p>
<p>But when it&rsquo;s undershooting</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re experiencing a business recession,</p>
<p>in a capitalist environment,</p>
<p>the market needs to clear that malinvestment,</p>
<p>that misallocation of capital.</p>
<p>That means someone made a bet on a certain idea</p>
<p>that it would satisfy wants in a particular way,</p>
<p>and that bet did not pan out.</p>
<p>If you then paper over the losses</p>
<p>that business is creating,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re now delaying and exacerbating the volatility</p>
<p>that that idea created.</p>
<p>So this is kind of a Tel Aviv concept</p>
<p>where you can dampen short run volatility,</p>
<p>but volatility is truth.</p>
<p>Volatility is us matching our ideas to reality, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re constantly, again, overshooting and undershooting.</p>
<p>So you delay volatility,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just amplifying it and exacerbating it</p>
<p>in the long run.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what central bank is doing.</p>
<p>The central bank mandate is low unemployment</p>
<p>and low and expected inflation, basically.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re trying to achieve economic growth</p>
<p>in a stable way, quote unquote, stable way.</p>
<p>This is their ostensible purpose.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just not possible.</p>
<p>Growth is an inherently instable process.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate a little bit</p>
<p>about the nature of volatility?</p>
<p>Why is it communicating truth?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that a lot of people are afraid of</p>
<p>is the volatility.</p>
<p>Almost like it&rsquo;s a sign of chaos,</p>
<p>and so they want to escape chaos.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying that that&rsquo;s actually,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s chaos or not, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s getting us closer to the fundamental reality</p>
<p>that we should not be trying to escape.</p>
<p>Yeah, so if we consider that the universe</p>
<p>is pervaded by entropy, right?</p>
<p>This is the second law of thermodynamics</p>
<p>is that every closed system</p>
<p>tends towards greater disorder over time.</p>
<p>And that life itself, again,</p>
<p>I would argue expressed through the logos,</p>
<p>we, life, is the antientropic principle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the only thing that&rsquo;s converting entropy into order,</p>
<p>chaos into order.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what entrepreneurs are doing, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re living at the edges of the known,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re testing ourself against the entropy of nature,</p>
<p>trying to figure out new and better ways</p>
<p>of saying, doing, or making things.</p>
<p>And then if we do crack a code or figure something out,</p>
<p>we then have a big incentive.</p>
<p>The incentive is to get rich, right?</p>
<p>Because then you have a new idea</p>
<p>that you could then sell back into the marketplace.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this sequence of courageously confronting</p>
<p>the entropy of nature and converting it</p>
<p>into good and useful order,</p>
<p>which by the way is like the ancient idea of God in Genesis,</p>
<p>which I think is interesting,</p>
<p>that actually enables us to construct civilization</p>
<p>in these layers of anti entropy or order, you might say.</p>
<p>So today we live in a bubble of anti entropy or order,</p>
<p>like the coastlines are guarded by the nation</p>
<p>and the city has a certain police force</p>
<p>that keeps it in order.</p>
<p>Even the way we talk,</p>
<p>like clearly the words matter,</p>
<p>but also the nonverbal cues,</p>
<p>all these things are like order that has been established</p>
<p>over many, many, many thousands of years of human evolution.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s, when I say volatility is truth,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m saying is that the experience of uncertainty</p>
<p>is something that&rsquo;s ineradicable from life, right?</p>
<p>And certainty, like it&rsquo;s kind of a paradox</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re fighting against it, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to innovate our way away from uncertainty</p>
<p>to create more capital,</p>
<p>which capital is very simply a way of mitigating uncertainty.</p>
<p>So this is why you might have like a stash of food</p>
<p>in case the power goes out or a generator,</p>
<p>like it helps you overcome uncertainty over time.</p>
<p>But uncertainty is also where all the sweetness of life is.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s gotta be this balance</p>
<p>with one foot in, one foot out.</p>
<p>So human society is this kind of bubble of order</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve constructed and slowly expanding,</p>
<p>but at the edges, you&rsquo;re always going to have that chaos,</p>
<p>that volatility, and that the entrepreneurs</p>
<p>are kind of like jumping into that chaos</p>
<p>and some of them die and some of them succeed.</p>
<p>And so like, if you wanna grow this bubble of order,</p>
<p>you have to be embracing the volatility at the edges.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And reverence for entrepreneurship</p>
<p>because these are the people putting their neck out,</p>
<p>so to speak, risking themselves.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re gonna contribute to society, by the way,</p>
<p>whether they go up in flames or not.</p>
<p>If they go up in flames,</p>
<p>society has witnessed their experience</p>
<p>as something not to do or something that doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>in a particular time and place.</p>
<p>So that you could say them going up in flames</p>
<p>is a way of enlightening the rest of us.</p>
<p>Or if they figure something out,</p>
<p>Steve Jobs creates the iPhone, changes the world forever.</p>
<p>So enlightening the rest of us, okay.</p>
<p>And Taleb would say.</p>
<p>The fire of their failure, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Taleb would say individual fragility</p>
<p>is inseparable from ensemble anti fragility.</p>
<p>So this means that, again,</p>
<p>every time that entrepreneur goes up in flames</p>
<p>or say a restaurant goes out of business,</p>
<p>when a restaurant goes out of business,</p>
<p>that particular cuisine strategy they were implementing</p>
<p>in that particular time and place,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a signal to all the other restaurants in the area</p>
<p>that that doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>So restaurant food improves from bankruptcy to bankruptcy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this death of the individual components</p>
<p>that contributes to the growth of the ensemble.</p>
<p>As a small aside, maybe you can guide me through it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re paying attention,</p>
<p>but there was some chaos around Taleb</p>
<p>and the Bitcoin community.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t quite paying attention,</p>
<p>but from my outsider&rsquo;s perspective,</p>
<p>I thought it seemed Taleb was a supporter of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And then a lot of people were very upset about something.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry if I don&rsquo;t know the details,</p>
<p>but can you pull out some profound philosophical ideas</p>
<p>from the disagreement of the chaos?</p>
<p>I admittedly don&rsquo;t know too much about it either.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of his writing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s always been a little different in person.</p>
<p>Like I actually, he signed one of my books.</p>
<p>I met him in person.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just, he&rsquo;s got a very abrasive personality.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s kind of known for it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m passing any judgment here.</p>
<p>He sort of embraces it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But he had written the forward</p>
<p>to a really important book in Bitcoin</p>
<p>called the Bitcoin Standard for safety in a moose.</p>
<p>And then I think they had a little Twitter beef</p>
<p>because safety is very much against COVID mask</p>
<p>and state intervention,</p>
<p>whereas Taleb&rsquo;s on the other side of the fence.</p>
<p>And so, and then after that beef,</p>
<p>Taleb came out against Bitcoiners saying,</p>
<p>oh, Bitcoiners are crazy and wrong.</p>
<p>I think the great mask debate of the 2020</p>
<p>will probably be the thing</p>
<p>that ultimately leads to World War III.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been very surprised how tense, how much like division</p>
<p>this one little arguably silly thing has led to.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people sort of project their,</p>
<p>like, it&rsquo;s almost like not wearing a mask</p>
<p>is a statement of sovereignty, of freedom,</p>
<p>of like saying fuck you to the man,</p>
<p>the government, the centralized power,</p>
<p>or the dishonesty or the, in the scientific community,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And then wearing a mask is a sort of kind of signaling</p>
<p>of various kind of social aspects.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not paying attention to it.</p>
<p>I actually tuned out.</p>
<p>I was part of a group of scientists</p>
<p>that were looking into like, do masks work?</p>
<p>This very interesting question.</p>
<p>To me, it was an interesting question.</p>
<p>I sort of roll in to ask that very interesting question</p>
<p>because I think it is an interesting scientific question.</p>
<p>But then I quickly realized that just as I was doing this,</p>
<p>like scientific exploration of this very interesting question</p>
<p>about Viron particles, like what kind of things,</p>
<p>like from a scientific perspective,</p>
<p>how do we prevent the spread of a pandemic?</p>
<p>Forget COVID, any pandemic, super deadly or not deadly.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s tools, there&rsquo;s testing, there&rsquo;s masks,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all these tools, how well do they work?</p>
<p>And then I realized, you know, in April or so,</p>
<p>it became a tool of politics, a tool of philosophy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when I sort of pulled out.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a canvas on which people project</p>
<p>their emotions and I guess Tillam got caught up</p>
<p>in that kind of, so there&rsquo;s nothing fundamental,</p>
<p>I suppose, to their disagreement.</p>
<p>Not that I&rsquo;m aware of, but he is, you know,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s written some about in his books,</p>
<p>the problem with centralization.</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of his writing addresses that</p>
<p>and he actually points to, I think Switzerland</p>
<p>is the best government in the world</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s decentralized.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s that, I don&rsquo;t think he has any,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not to speak for him, but I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s voiced</p>
<p>any specific critiques on Bitcoin per se.</p>
<p>Could be wrong about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just maybe his flavorful language</p>
<p>and the way he likes to communicate.</p>
<p>And the other theory is that maybe he&rsquo;s playing 4D chess</p>
<p>and having a Twitter boating accident, you know.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t believe in Bitcoin, I&rsquo;ve sold all my Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Oh, I see.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sorry, the boating accident in Bitcoin is this,</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s proverbial by this point,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s the way you lose your Bitcoin.</p>
<p>So if someone comes after you and says,</p>
<p>hey, you know, whether it&rsquo;s a government</p>
<p>or an individual&rsquo;s coming after you saying,</p>
<p>give me all your Bitcoin or pay these taxes in Bitcoin,</p>
<p>you go, oh, I had a boating accident and lost them all.</p>
<p>Lost them all.</p>
<p>So, yeah.</p>
<p>But back to the fundamental nature of space time.</p>
<p>Let me ask you, because we&rsquo;re kind of left at,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to go back to this idea of,</p>
<p>that you said that everything we think, say,</p>
<p>or do occurs within the bounds of space time.</p>
<p>So first of all, maybe you can comment on</p>
<p>what do you mean in this context about space time,</p>
<p>but also about the nature of truth.</p>
<p>Like how much of all of this is knowable?</p>
<p>How much of this is accessible to us humans?</p>
<p>How much uncertainty, like what we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>is there in the world?</p>
<p>Are you, do you fall in a place</p>
<p>where we can reason deeply about this world</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s knowable, or is it mostly chaos</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just holding on for dear life?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I said that all action occurs</p>
<p>within the bounds of space time.</p>
<p>The other thing, everything we say, do, or make,</p>
<p>the other thing is that everything we say, do, or make</p>
<p>starts out as an idea.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this concept of universal Darwinism,</p>
<p>which basically applies Darwinian principles,</p>
<p>but outside of the biological sphere.</p>
<p>So we could say that this kind of gets into</p>
<p>Richard Dawkins memetics, that even ideas are competing,</p>
<p>reproducing, recombining.</p>
<p>That idea is so powerful, by the way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s been understood fully.</p>
<p>I think in the digital, in the 21st century,</p>
<p>in the digital world, from my perspective</p>
<p>in artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s yet to be some profound things</p>
<p>to be discovered about this whole construct.</p>
<p>Agreed completely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been called an acid, actually,</p>
<p>in that it strips away all of the noninformational</p>
<p>components of something, just strips it down</p>
<p>to its bare bones.</p>
<p>I have a quote in here somewhere about that, but.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, which is called an acid?</p>
<p>The ideas?</p>
<p>The universal Darwinism.</p>
<p>Darwinism applied broadly, outside of the.</p>
<p>Applied broadly, and I&rsquo;ll condition all of this</p>
<p>by saying that a lot, most of my thinking</p>
<p>is shaped by a book I read recently</p>
<p>called The Case Against Reality,</p>
<p>which introduced me to this concept,</p>
<p>but it tied into Darwinism that I&rsquo;ve used</p>
<p>more broadly in the past, looking at things</p>
<p>like money and economics.</p>
<p>So the book, The Case Against Reality,</p>
<p>by Donald Hoffman, he has a quote in the book</p>
<p>that describes universal Darwinism.</p>
<p>It says, quote, universal Darwinism can,</p>
<p>without risk of refuting itself,</p>
<p>address our key question.</p>
<p>Does natural selection favor true perceptions?</p>
<p>If the answer happens to be no,</p>
<p>then it hasn&rsquo;t shot itself in the foot.</p>
<p>The uncanny power of universal Darwinism</p>
<p>has been likened by the philosopher Dan Dennett</p>
<p>to a universal acid.</p>
<p>And Dan Dennett says, quote, there is no denying</p>
<p>at this point that Darwin&rsquo;s idea is a universal solvent,</p>
<p>capable of cutting right to the heart</p>
<p>of everything in sight.</p>
<p>The question is, what does it leave behind?</p>
<p>I have tried to show that once it passes through everything,</p>
<p>we are left with stronger, sounder versions</p>
<p>of our most important ideas.</p>
<p>Some of the traditional details perish,</p>
<p>and some of these are losses to be regretted,</p>
<p>but good riddance to the rest of them.</p>
<p>What remains is more than enough to build on, unquote.</p>
<p>So the way I would interpret that is that life itself,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come to view life as information propagating</p>
<p>through flesh, and that we are,</p>
<p>I guess DNA is a quadratic code.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s four letters, maybe,</p>
<p>versus a binary, zeros and ones.</p>
<p>And we are ideas, we are strategies competing</p>
<p>with each other, and nature is that which selects.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what selects the winning ideas,</p>
<p>the ones that are most fit</p>
<p>to environmental conditions, frankly.</p>
<p>You know, talking about sovereignty and individualism,</p>
<p>there might need to be some rethinking here</p>
<p>about what is actually the basic individual entity</p>
<p>that is to be sovereign.</p>
<p>Like maybe our biological meat vehicles</p>
<p>were like way overly attached to them.</p>
<p>Like maybe, especially with genetics</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>or artificial intelligence, or living more and more</p>
<p>in virtual worlds will become detached</p>
<p>from that kind of idea.</p>
<p>So for example, if I can clone you,</p>
<p>you know, make one million robbers,</p>
<p>and, you know, but you&rsquo;ll all have the same idea,</p>
<p>what is your real value as the,</p>
<p>like I could just shoot you,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;ll still be 999 of you,</p>
<p>but the idea is the important thing,</p>
<p>the things you believe, so.</p>
<p>I would argue that I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>even if you clone someone perfectly,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you can reproduce the individual themselves,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re all a product of nature and nurture, right?</p>
<p>So my particular concourse of experiences,</p>
<p>the path dependence that I represent cannot be replicated,</p>
<p>nor can anyone&rsquo;s for that matter.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a hypothesis, so.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s of course a human meat bag would say.</p>
<p>Good point.</p>
<p>Like desperate trying to preserve himself.</p>
<p>You know, I think it reduces</p>
<p>to some fundamental questions about what is consciousness,</p>
<p>and whether that can be cloned.</p>
<p>All those kind of, you know,</p>
<p>it gets to the core of what it is to be human.</p>
<p>What are the things that make you particularly you?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it would assume</p>
<p>kind of a materialist viewpoint on reality,</p>
<p>and that if you could reproduce every atom of an individual</p>
<p>that you would have their experience encapsulated in that.</p>
<p>And, you know, Hoffman&rsquo;s, which his book is very radical,</p>
<p>he argues that space and time is not an objective reality,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a biological interface.</p>
<p>So we are scanning our environment for fitness payoffs,</p>
<p>and this space and time is the rendering</p>
<p>specific to human beings</p>
<p>that allows us to navigate reality effectively.</p>
<p>So the further argument would be</p>
<p>that we all have pretty similar interfaces,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re all slightly different too,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re all, you know, adapting in different ways,</p>
<p>and that different animals have their own unique interfaces.</p>
<p>So we have a certain amount of photoreceptors in our eye,</p>
<p>whereas I think the number is three, might be five,</p>
<p>or something like the mantis shrimp has like seven or nine.</p>
<p>So they can see,</p>
<p>and we only see one 10 trillionth of the light spectrum.</p>
<p>So talk about a tiny fraction.</p>
<p>I mean, one 10 trillionth is a very minuscule number,</p>
<p>and that makes up all of the light</p>
<p>that we can interpret with our eyes.</p>
<p>But something like a mantis shrimp</p>
<p>could see, you know, much more of that.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s this, we&rsquo;re very conditioned</p>
<p>to have a fully materialist viewpoint on reality today,</p>
<p>where we think, you know,</p>
<p>the atomic clockwork kind of universe.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true exactly.</p>
<p>And another school that goes into that</p>
<p>is actually Austrian economics,</p>
<p>where we could say that, you know,</p>
<p>we mentioned earlier that an asset is not property.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually based on the relationship</p>
<p>between the individual and the property.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this whole realm of relevance associated with,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all moving through life</p>
<p>in the course of a goal directed action.</p>
<p>So when we walk across a room, I go from A to B,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because I valued B more than A.</p>
<p>So value is inseparable from human action.</p>
<p>We have a rank ordered value system in our mind,</p>
<p>each of us, and we&rsquo;re constantly taking action</p>
<p>in accordance with those rank values.</p>
<p>Anything that accelerates us on the course</p>
<p>of our goal directed action towards our goal is useful.</p>
<p>Anything that impedes us, or we could say is valuable,</p>
<p>anything that impedes us is actually obstructing to value.</p>
<p>And anything that&rsquo;s irrelevant is just valueless.</p>
<p>So this table that we&rsquo;re using right now,</p>
<p>like this is an accessory to UNI</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s holding this paper</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s holding the information</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s guiding our conversation.</p>
<p>But we could pay someone $100 to jump over this table.</p>
<p>And this table could simultaneously be an accessory to UNI</p>
<p>and an obstacle to someone else.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this domain, this silent contention of willpower</p>
<p>and agendas occurring across the face of the earth</p>
<p>that is what Austrian economics really looks at.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the realm of human action, as they call it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called praxeology.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a non materialist viewpoint on reality</p>
<p>and that things, we think in terms of matter being reality,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s often more so in the sphere of human action,</p>
<p>what matters, that is reality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the relevance of a thing</p>
<p>to the course of one&rsquo;s goal directed action.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s ultimately exists in the space of ideas.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Not in the space of physical matter.</p>
<p>And just to jump back to this line here,</p>
<p>I think his fundamental line here is the question is,</p>
<p>talking about universal Darwinism as an asset,</p>
<p>what does it leave behind?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to show that once it passes through everything,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re left with stronger, sounder versions</p>
<p>of our most useful ideas.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the key point to me.</p>
<p>And that ideas and information, so far as we can tell,</p>
<p>are the most fundamental substrate of reality.</p>
<p>And information itself, back to entropy,</p>
<p>information is the resolution of entropy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the bit is, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a one or a zero.</p>
<p>Whatever reduces your entropy by half is a bit.</p>
<p>And we measure information in bits.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t have ideas, ideas have people.</p>
<p>Honestly, it&rsquo;s a really profound idea</p>
<p>or a statement about reality, a reframing of reality.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re actually being deeply honest about it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s quite painful.</p>
<p>I do appreciate that you defended</p>
<p>your biological meatbag earlier,</p>
<p>but it seems like ideas are the things that have power.</p>
<p>That me, Lex, for example, is worthless.</p>
<p>And relative to the ideas that used my brain</p>
<p>for a bit of a time.</p>
<p>But so far as we know, only human beings</p>
<p>can generate and share ideas.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t say Lex is worthless.</p>
<p>Like you are the node of the idea sphere.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the newest fear.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>From a Bitcoin perspective, I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m mining.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m solving the cryptographic problem and generate.</p>
<p>In that sense, I&rsquo;m a useful node.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re competing to solve the puzzle of entropy,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>And when you do solve it, it benefits the entire network.</p>
<p>But I guess from my perspective,</p>
<p>just because just working in AI,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at the longterm vision.</p>
<p>I see us humans and AI systems as really the same</p>
<p>and AI systems ultimately as something</p>
<p>that supersedes humans.</p>
<p>So what is intelligence?</p>
<p>So in the context of our current discussion,</p>
<p>I think intelligence is very closely linked</p>
<p>to this notion of ideas.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the ability to generate ideas,</p>
<p>to mold ideas, to compress seeming chaos</p>
<p>into some model, into some theory</p>
<p>that efficiently compresses the chaos</p>
<p>in a way where you can then integrate it with other ideas</p>
<p>and they can play and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>So in that sense, it&rsquo;s the turning chaos into order.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the molding of ideas such that our human brains</p>
<p>can work with it.</p>
<p>And just from my perspective,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any reason why that can not be algorithmatized,</p>
<p>converted into computational systems.</p>
<p>I would agree.</p>
<p>Which is scary.</p>
<p>Scary or potentially really promising, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of the case of all novelty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terrifying as much as it is promising.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re pursuing it so heavily.</p>
<p>I would maybe take it a step further</p>
<p>and say that intelligence</p>
<p>in maybe its most simplistic form is error correction.</p>
<p>So we, humans have wants.</p>
<p>Again, we&rsquo;re constantly expressing our value through action.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no other way to express it by the way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s whatever you choose to do in any moment,</p>
<p>you are expressing the values you hold</p>
<p>in your mind and your heart.</p>
<p>So as we move from less valued A to more valued B,</p>
<p>entropy happens, uncertainty happens, we fall off course.</p>
<p>And it is intelligence that enables us</p>
<p>to render information from that experience</p>
<p>and error correct, right?</p>
<p>So that we can move slightly,</p>
<p>shift our trajectory slightly more towards B</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re trying to move towards.</p>
<p>So I think that there&rsquo;s something there</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t know that we can make synthetically.</p>
<p>And that if we define intelligence as error correction,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like error correction to what?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s error correction towards what we find is valuable.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re trying to satisfy human wants.</p>
<p>Might not just be our own, could be others as well.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m an entrepreneur,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to solve the wants of others, not just myself.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m trying to error correct myself towards that goal,</p>
<p>using intelligence and processing environmental feedback</p>
<p>through intelligence to error correct.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know how,</p>
<p>if you eliminate the human element completely,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s doing the wanting, right?</p>
<p>Where does value come from?</p>
<p>I know the machine learning people who are listening</p>
<p>are saying that&rsquo;s exactly what machine learning is,</p>
<p>which is error correction</p>
<p>because you have a loss function, objective function</p>
<p>that measures how wrong your thing is</p>
<p>and you wanna make it less wrong next time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole process of machine learning.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying what humans are able to do</p>
<p>is in a world where there&rsquo;s no maybe objective values,</p>
<p>absolute values, you&rsquo;re generating that very loss function,</p>
<p>that objective function that measures the error</p>
<p>comes from the human mind.</p>
<p>Some aliens might disagree with you</p>
<p>because they might have a different objective function.</p>
<p>Obviously, the purpose comes from consciousness, I think.</p>
<p>And without purpose, there&rsquo;s not error correction.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, this is again, a hypothesis.</p>
<p>Like where does purpose come from?</p>
<p>It seems to come from consciousness, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where suffering comes from</p>
<p>and you want to lessen suffering.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where pleasure comes from.</p>
<p>It seems like it&rsquo;s consciousness.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s something to this biological meat bag.</p>
<p>So to take it one layer deeper on this</p>
<p>and the reason I like this book so much,</p>
<p>again, The Case Against Reality.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s making the case that space and time</p>
<p>are not fundamental.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Which I started my intellectual explorations in physics,</p>
<p>actually astrophysics.</p>
<p>So for the longest time, even the way I describe money</p>
<p>as I talk about space and time, so that blew my mind.</p>
<p>But this dovetailed nicely with another book called Lila.</p>
<p>The author is Robert Persig.</p>
<p>So he wrote Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,</p>
<p>which is a very popular book.</p>
<p>20 years later, he wrote Lila, which no one&rsquo;s heard of,</p>
<p>which is crazy.</p>
<p>And he basically says he was wrong about his first book.</p>
<p>And he lays out this entire other metaphysics of quality,</p>
<p>he calls it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the metaphysics, I think it&rsquo;s metaphysics of quality.</p>
<p>But his supposition is that it&rsquo;s not physical reality</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fundamental.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not informational information that&rsquo;s fundamental,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s value.</p>
<p>So he actually, and it&rsquo;s a beautiful book,</p>
<p>I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>He essentially is refuting causality itself.</p>
<p>We think A causes B.</p>
<p>This book makes the case that B values precondition A,</p>
<p>so that we are actually creating our future</p>
<p>through our value systems.</p>
<p>And this goes back to something,</p>
<p>I think Solzhenitsyn said this,</p>
<p>that the line between good and evil</p>
<p>runs down the heart of every man.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s as if our moral decisions</p>
<p>are actually what&rsquo;s creating the outcomes</p>
<p>in reality over time.</p>
<p>And then that gets into all the wisdom traditions</p>
<p>related to religion,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s always talking about loving thy neighbor</p>
<p>and loving God and all of these other things</p>
<p>that are good morally to create the best outcomes.</p>
<p>So values are fundamental.</p>
<p>Value, yes.</p>
<p>Value is fundamental.</p>
<p>Oh boy, yeah, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It does feel like physics is not capturing something.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s some people, panpsychists argue</p>
<p>that consciousness might be one of the fundamental</p>
<p>properties of nature,</p>
<p>like from which emerges everything we see.</p>
<p>So that could be just other words</p>
<p>for this same notion of value.</p>
<p>And then the basic laws of physics</p>
<p>are not capturing that currently.</p>
<p>So maybe humans, in order to understand</p>
<p>from where humans came from,</p>
<p>we have to understand these other properties of nature,</p>
<p>which are yet to be discovered at the physics level.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, we contend with that underlying nature,</p>
<p>whatever it is, with the logos, right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re looking at uncategorized nature</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re assigning a word to it.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re slicing up chaos into little boxes of order.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re establishing this social consensus</p>
<p>as to those labels, which we&rsquo;d call words.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re using that to communicate.</p>
<p>And when we communicate,</p>
<p>we can start to build these other things.</p>
<p>This is like the Yuval Harari imagined orders.</p>
<p>So we can create these useful fictions, right?</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s the nation state or human rights or money.</p>
<p>And that allows us to cooperate flexibly in large numbers</p>
<p>so that we can better contend with reality.</p>
<p>We can produce more complicated things.</p>
<p>We can enlarge that bubble of civilization against entropy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what capitalism is all about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about further specializing knowledge,</p>
<p>further enriching mankind&rsquo;s treasury of knowledge</p>
<p>and doing it.</p>
<p>But to do that, the communication media that we&rsquo;re using,</p>
<p>the words have to have stable meaning.</p>
<p>The money needs to have value that&rsquo;s dependable, right?</p>
<p>It needs to be something that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not dictated</p>
<p>by any one group.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s reached by consensus of the entire group.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how, so you could think it&rsquo;s like optimizing</p>
<p>for error correction again,</p>
<p>where a free market would be harnessing the intelligence</p>
<p>of all market actors and a central planning</p>
<p>or essentially planned market would be harnessing</p>
<p>just the intelligence of a small group of bureaucrats.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not obvious how to achieve this kind</p>
<p>of consensus mechanism.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s obviously, we&rsquo;ll talk about sort of Bitcoin</p>
<p>as an idea.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the idea of Bitcoin is connecting it to physics.</p>
<p>So like, you can trust that physical matter won&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>But, you know, there could be other ideas that we get.</p>
<p>Maybe physics could be changed.</p>
<p>If Eric Weinstein has anything to say about it.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s, you know, we right now believe</p>
<p>that physics can&rsquo;t be changed.</p>
<p>The physical matter of the world, but maybe it can</p>
<p>in a way that we&rsquo;re totally not understanding.</p>
<p>You mentioned sort of reality</p>
<p>from Donald Hoffman&rsquo;s perspective.</p>
<p>Like if we don&rsquo;t have even close to direct access</p>
<p>to the fabric of reality, maybe we&rsquo;re living in a world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very like many dimensions,</p>
<p>that the notions of space and time is just like a silly,</p>
<p>useful construct that&rsquo;s not at all connected.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re starting to look at like Stephen Wolframs.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar with this view</p>
<p>of the world that it&rsquo;s like hypergraphs underneath it all.</p>
<p>Like these mathematical structures</p>
<p>from which everything emerges.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re like many, many, many orders of magnitude,</p>
<p>smaller than what we think of.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re even smaller than like strings and string theory.</p>
<p>So like those are the basic mathematical objects</p>
<p>from which it emerges.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s an interesting philosophical framework.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also, people should check out a cool way to play</p>
<p>with beautiful hypergraph mathematical structures.</p>
<p>So he has, I don&rsquo;t know if you know who Stephen Wolfram is,</p>
<p>but he created Wolfram Alpha and all these tools</p>
<p>that you can actually visualize and play with.</p>
<p>So you can play with physics in a visual way,</p>
<p>which, or at least discrete mathematics,</p>
<p>which I think is incredible.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t get enough love.</p>
<p>One of the reasons he, I think doesn&rsquo;t get enough love</p>
<p>is because of this little quirk of human nature,</p>
<p>which is the ego.</p>
<p>And he sometimes frustrates a few folks</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s very, let&rsquo;s say proud of his work.</p>
<p>I guess.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s interesting to think about a world</p>
<p>where we don&rsquo;t have direct access to reality,</p>
<p>as Hoffman argues.</p>
<p>And maybe, I don&rsquo;t know if you can comment.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar with Ayn Rand&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>and her whole philosophy of objectivism</p>
<p>or her whole contention is that, you know,</p>
<p>we do have access.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to misstate it,</p>
<p>but at least she would claim</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not useful,</p>
<p>or I think she would probably say it&rsquo;s not correct</p>
<p>to argue that we don&rsquo;t have access to reality.</p>
<p>We have, hence, objectivism.</p>
<p>We have direct access to reality.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only thing we can reason about.</p>
<p>And the only way to live life morally</p>
<p>is to reason through everything,</p>
<p>starting with the axioms of reality,</p>
<p>which we do have direct access to.</p>
<p>Do you have thoughts about her work?</p>
<p>I am slightly ashamed to say I have not read Ayn Rand yet.</p>
<p>So she is high on my list</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s been recommended a number of times.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know a lot specifically</p>
<p>about her philosophy or objectivism,</p>
<p>but to me, it resonates closely</p>
<p>with what the American pragmatist commented on truth.</p>
<p>And they distinguished what you could say</p>
<p>is absolute truth, which is at the bottom of reality,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s Mr. Wolfram&rsquo;s mathematical formulas or value,</p>
<p>whatever it may be, it&rsquo;s something ineffable,</p>
<p>something beyond the reach of epistemology, perhaps even.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s why religion just sort of points to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trying to use, I think Joseph Campbell said something</p>
<p>like religion is using stories</p>
<p>to point towards the same transcendental mystery</p>
<p>we all experience but cannot articulate.</p>
<p>So something like the artist,</p>
<p>the artist uses lies to point to the truth,</p>
<p>something like that, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>But the American pragmatist said that,</p>
<p>because at the end of the day, this is all about,</p>
<p>when we say truth, we need something</p>
<p>that is close to social consensus</p>
<p>and is not shakable by political action.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what physics and mathematics are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an unshakable point of reference,</p>
<p>I guess you might say.</p>
<p>So the American pragmatist defined truth</p>
<p>as the end of inquiry.</p>
<p>And in markets, we could say that the market itself</p>
<p>is a forum that generates truth.</p>
<p>We call this pragmatic truth</p>
<p>to separate pure objective truth</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t even talk about without polluting it</p>
<p>versus pragmatic truth,</p>
<p>which is something that&rsquo;s useful.</p>
<p>So the example here would be,</p>
<p>if I give you a map and you&rsquo;re trying to go</p>
<p>from your house to the local brisket restaurant,</p>
<p>and the map gets you from your house</p>
<p>to the brisket restaurant,</p>
<p>is that because the map is true</p>
<p>or is that because the map is useful?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very hard to disentangle</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re just looking at it pragmatically.</p>
<p>And in markets, markets, I argue,</p>
<p>generate three forms of pragmatic truth.</p>
<p>One is the price.</p>
<p>So this is the collective subjective demand</p>
<p>and purchasing power of humanity</p>
<p>running up against the objective supply of capital</p>
<p>and resources in the marketplace.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s demand overlaid on supply.</p>
<p>The result of that is the price.</p>
<p>So that is the most truthful exchange ratio,</p>
<p>which is the closest approximation to the value</p>
<p>of any good in the marketplace.</p>
<p>So it gives us a data point on which we can operate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s compressing all known market realities</p>
<p>down into a single actionable number.</p>
<p>You know, based on the price of bread or copper,</p>
<p>whether you wanna buy more of it,</p>
<p>you wanna abstain from buying it,</p>
<p>or maybe you wanna try and find substitutes.</p>
<p>And you can think of that price signal,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like an economic nerve signal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s coordinating human action across time.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re one socioeconomic superorganism or collective,</p>
<p>that the price signal is the nerve.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the first form of pragmatic truth</p>
<p>that markets generate.</p>
<p>The second form would be tools and innovations themselves.</p>
<p>So entrepreneurs are experimenting across time.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to satisfy the wants of consumers.</p>
<p>Consumers are sovereign in the marketplace.</p>
<p>Whatever the consumer wants, the consumer gets, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to satisfy that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to do it at a profit.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m trying to take viewing the existing price signals</p>
<p>of goods in the marketplace.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to assemble those in a way</p>
<p>at a cost lower than the final solution</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m delivering to my customer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m selling it at a price higher</p>
<p>than the productive factors I combined to create it.</p>
<p>And in that iterative process,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re constantly discovering new and better ways</p>
<p>of solving problems or satisfying the wants.</p>
<p>So we could say, to go out and dig a hole, right?</p>
<p>Someone wants a hole dug,</p>
<p>that a shovel is gonna let you do it much faster per hour</p>
<p>than you would with your bare hands.</p>
<p>So what is the pragmatic truth of digging holes?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shovel, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way we know how to solve</p>
<p>any particular problem based on</p>
<p>the existing treasury of knowledge.</p>
<p>So every tool, again, we&rsquo;re back to ideas being fundamental.</p>
<p>The shovel itself is just a knowledge structure.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve figured out a way to create this particular implement</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ve indexed the raw materials</p>
<p>we found in nature to this knowledge structure</p>
<p>to create a shovel,</p>
<p>which allows us to better satisfy human wants</p>
<p>faster, cheaper, better, effectively.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to generalize,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re blowing my mind a little bit here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to generalize the idea of tool</p>
<p>to how to think about it.</p>
<p>Cause I keep just, when you say tool,</p>
<p>I keep imagining different tools,</p>
<p>like specific instantiations of a tool.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to see, so the price is a pragmatic truth</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s communicating value in this network.</p>
<p>Subjective demands against objective supply.</p>
<p>Subjective.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an economic democracy.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the demand supply.</p>
<p>And then the tools are the ways of extracting</p>
<p>or solving problems is the more general kind of thing.</p>
<p>Or satisfying wants.</p>
<p>Satisfying wants.</p>
<p>So wants are somehow, that&rsquo;s part of the supply</p>
<p>and the demand.</p>
<p>And wants are back to value, right?</p>
<p>Cause everything someone wants,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re expressing their value.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the shovel is a pragmatic truth.</p>
<p>The shovel is truth.</p>
<p>It feels like a good book title.</p>
<p>Okay, sorry.</p>
<p>So what other pragma, what is it?</p>
<p>And then the third one I would argue is virtue actually.</p>
<p>Oh wow.</p>
<p>And another way to maybe think about this</p>
<p>is competitive competency,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also cooperative competency.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re learning over time what characteristics,</p>
<p>what patterns of action, what mindsets,</p>
<p>what mental tools, what heuristics are most useful</p>
<p>to satisfying customer wants.</p>
<p>So I think that becomes over time,</p>
<p>becomes sharpened into virtue, right?</p>
<p>Like we know it&rsquo;s best to be honest</p>
<p>because if you lie, it&rsquo;s very energy inefficient, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re creating this little fork of reality.</p>
<p>And then if someone else asks you about that lie again,</p>
<p>you have to put another layer of lies on top of it.</p>
<p>Where if you just tell the truth,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just recollecting what happened.</p>
<p>And so that sort of keeps,</p>
<p>again, when we&rsquo;re talking about delaying volatility, right?</p>
<p>If you lie, you&rsquo;re delaying short term volatility,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re increasing longterm volatility.</p>
<p>What about murder?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been able to figure out why murder is bad</p>
<p>because I just keep wanting to murder people.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve murdered many.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s the one for that.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m trying to get an interview</p>
<p>with Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s fascinating, virtue in this market</p>
<p>with the supplies and demands, and there&rsquo;s the tools,</p>
<p>which is also a pragmatic truth, and there&rsquo;s virtue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pragmatic truth.</p>
<p>Yeah, and if we interfere with that free market process,</p>
<p>again, if we overstep, which this maybe ties into murder,</p>
<p>if you start to be coercive against life,</p>
<p>liberty or property,</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re forcibly taking someone&rsquo;s life,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re breaking down the trust in that market</p>
<p>that generates these pragmatic truths.</p>
<p>If you forcibly infringe on someone&rsquo;s liberty, right?</p>
<p>For any reason other than them originally breaking</p>
<p>or infringing upon life, liberty or property,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s not gonna work either.</p>
<p>And then if you violate private property rights,</p>
<p>if you steal property from others,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re breaking down the trust</p>
<p>that the intersubjective fabric of money and markets</p>
<p>and the rule of law, all of these useful fictions</p>
<p>are meant to preserve,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re corrupting it and breaking it down.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s kind of interesting to think about the market</p>
<p>as helping evolve the virtues.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sharpened into virtues.</p>
<p>And then these virtues can then go</p>
<p>into motivational posters,</p>
<p>or like in books that we all agree on,</p>
<p>and then eventually take for granted</p>
<p>as if they were somehow fundamental to human nature,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not perhaps fundamental,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just pragmatic truths.</p>
<p>Yeah, another way to consider competition itself</p>
<p>is that it is a discovery process.</p>
<p>So, you know, entrepreneurs are competing with one another</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re trying to best satisfy consumer wants</p>
<p>at the lowest possible price.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re placing bets of time, energy and capital</p>
<p>on themselves, on their idea, their business plan.</p>
<p>And then the market decides, right?</p>
<p>The consensus of market actors decide which one was better.</p>
<p>One lives, one dies.</p>
<p>So competition itself is helping us get closer to truth,</p>
<p>to pragmatic truth.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re discovering what is the right price for this asset.</p>
<p>And that price, by the way, it&rsquo;s derived,</p>
<p>again, in the sense of data compression.</p>
<p>Everyone in the world can see that price.</p>
<p>Everyone in the world can then put their skin in the game</p>
<p>by choosing to buy or sell or short or go long</p>
<p>or do any number of financial actions on that price.</p>
<p>And that information is then propagated back out</p>
<p>to everyone else.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this feedback loop between market actor and price</p>
<p>that makes it so useful.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what carries us,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s these collisions of interest that carry us,</p>
<p>it removes the unuseful aspects of ourselves</p>
<p>or of our tools or of a price</p>
<p>and reveals pragmatic truth to us.</p>
<p>Can you play my therapist for a second?</p>
<p>And if we talk about creative destruction,</p>
<p>I think, not Bukowski,</p>
<p>Hunter S. Thompson has a quote,</p>
<p>something like, for all instances of beauty,</p>
<p>many souls must be trampled.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>But there does seem to be an aspect of competition</p>
<p>that destroys, you were talking about entrepreneurs</p>
<p>sort of on the outside of the circle of order,</p>
<p>striving to make sense, to compress volatility</p>
<p>of the chaos of the universe.</p>
<p>Is there some way to protect a little bit</p>
<p>against the pain of that destruction</p>
<p>or that creative destruction,</p>
<p>that entrepreneur screaming on fire</p>
<p>as he enlightens the rest of us,</p>
<p>is there some role for us humans together</p>
<p>in the togetherness of it?</p>
<p>Also government, but any kind of collectives</p>
<p>in helping that entrepreneur who&rsquo;s on fire</p>
<p>maybe after a few minutes to spray him with some water</p>
<p>and put him out of his misery?</p>
<p>I would say that pain is the inarguable basis of being.</p>
<p>Pain is, no matter how you try to explain it away</p>
<p>or describe it,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s not something you can rationalize away.</p>
<p>No one, I think ever,</p>
<p>someone may want to cut themselves to have an endorphin high</p>
<p>but no one wants to suffer, we&rsquo;d say, right?</p>
<p>So pain in that sense,</p>
<p>it is what we&rsquo;re constantly trying to deal with</p>
<p>and to move away from or create buffers between us</p>
<p>and potential pain or potential uncertainty.</p>
<p>And that pain is information.</p>
<p>When we experience something</p>
<p>that is misfit to the outcome we desired,</p>
<p>that pain is what puts us,</p>
<p>it encourages us to change our trajectory</p>
<p>to get back on course towards our valued aim.</p>
<p>So as far as, you need entrepreneurs that are exploring,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to do something new,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a pioneer of any kind,</p>
<p>you are courageously facing pain.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re willfully confronting it.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s avoidable in that sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like we can have pain free economic growth</p>
<p>like the central bank would maybe have us lend to believe</p>
<p>that we can just run these experiments</p>
<p>and when they fail,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll just paper over all the losses and continue.</p>
<p>Or you&rsquo;re just delaying and exacerbating</p>
<p>the inevitable volatility back to reality.</p>
<p>But what I would say is that capitalism,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re building,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re increasing the capital stock of the world,</p>
<p>which again, capital is the mitigation of risk.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re reducing the overall risk of existence</p>
<p>by accumulating more capital in the world.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what protects that entrepreneur</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s deciding, hey, I saved up a million bucks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go try this business idea.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna put all my money on the line.</p>
<p>And if he goes up in flames,</p>
<p>then his cost of living when he comes back to reality</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s starting over from zero,</p>
<p>his cost of living is substantially lower</p>
<p>starting over from zero than it was in the past.</p>
<p>So then he would be out in the wilderness on his own.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the accumulation of capital stock</p>
<p>is the buffer against uncertainty for everyone.</p>
<p>And it gives you actually more potential</p>
<p>to go out and experiment,</p>
<p>to go out and confront the chaos of nature</p>
<p>because you are better healed effectively.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;re speaking</p>
<p>in sort of idealistic terms about the power of capitals</p>
<p>and when it works well.</p>
<p>Is there any aspects that you think</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t work well in a free market</p>
<p>in all the basic pragmatic truths</p>
<p>that we were talking about?</p>
<p>Is there ways it can go wrong?</p>
<p>So I would first argue that we have never seen</p>
<p>an actual purely free market.</p>
<p>Closest example would be kind of geopolitically</p>
<p>we have a free market</p>
<p>and that governments are not necessarily governed</p>
<p>but they are premised on governing large groups</p>
<p>of individuals.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not, doesn&rsquo;t exactly.</p>
<p>You mean between governments?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>See, but isn&rsquo;t there still,</p>
<p>so a free market, maybe you can correct me,</p>
<p>is the free market still grounded in the ideas</p>
<p>of property rights and all those kinds of things, right?</p>
<p>So governments tend to also sometimes</p>
<p>be violent towards each other.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t respect all the basic aspects of capitalism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So maybe another way to look at this is that</p>
<p>gold is the original governor of government actually.</p>
<p>And this is the reason governments have abused</p>
<p>and gone off of the gold standard.</p>
<p>So historically, if you are a bank or a nation state</p>
<p>and you produce more currency</p>
<p>than your gold reserves can justify,</p>
<p>then gold will flow out of your bank</p>
<p>or out of your country.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this natural check via the money</p>
<p>that via capitalistic money, which is gold, right?</p>
<p>Gold was selected by the free market.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not decreed by government.</p>
<p>It provided this natural check on government action.</p>
<p>So my, I guess to get back to the original question is</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve never seen a pure free market</p>
<p>because money has always been monopolized</p>
<p>and coerced, frankly.</p>
<p>So to try and answer what goes wrong with a free market</p>
<p>is really difficult because we&rsquo;ve never actually seen it.</p>
<p>And I would define free market is one</p>
<p>in which government only protects life, liberty and property.</p>
<p>And so that has a very minimal role in society.</p>
<p>Again, just as network security</p>
<p>for the economic trade network.</p>
<p>And anything that, any government function that goes beyond</p>
<p>those three core functions, which by the way,</p>
<p>are pretty much the core tenants of morality as well.</p>
<p>So government&rsquo;s just really intended to preserve,</p>
<p>you know, natural law, if you will.</p>
<p>Anything that goes beyond that is,</p>
<p>moves us closer to an unfree market.</p>
<p>So every regulation, every act of coercion</p>
<p>is actually a gradation closer to a purely unfree market,</p>
<p>which would be a monopoly.</p>
<p>So in terms of what I guess theoretically we could say</p>
<p>goes wrong in the free market is that it&rsquo;s volatile.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trading off, it&rsquo;s accepting short term volatility</p>
<p>in exchange for less long run volatility.</p>
<p>And this tends to be the way of nature, by the way.</p>
<p>So if we look at something like there&rsquo;s a region</p>
<p>in North America called Baja, California,</p>
<p>and it runs into the United States</p>
<p>and it runs down into Mexico as well.</p>
<p>So the same topology, but two different jurisdictions.</p>
<p>In the US, we very heavily manage forest fires.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to manage nature effectively.</p>
<p>Whereas in Mexico is much more unregulated.</p>
<p>It just, when wildfires spring up, they let them burn off.</p>
<p>North America, when wildfires spring up,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re actually extinguishing them.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re constantly trying to dampen</p>
<p>the short run volatility of these small brush fires.</p>
<p>Whereas in Mexico, we just let them burn.</p>
<p>We let nature do its thing.</p>
<p>The consequence of this is that the wildfires</p>
<p>still occur eventually, but they&rsquo;re much larger</p>
<p>and much more devastating in North America</p>
<p>where human intervention has occurred</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s dampening nature&rsquo;s natural corrective mechanism</p>
<p>of clearing this underbrush with these more frequent</p>
<p>and smaller fires at the cost of much larger fires.</p>
<p>So again, we&rsquo;re delaying short term volatility</p>
<p>and exacerbating long run volatility.</p>
<p>And in Mexico, it&rsquo;s the opposite, right?</p>
<p>Just these wildfires burn much smaller</p>
<p>and more continuously over time.</p>
<p>The further effect of that in North America</p>
<p>is that the fires can get so big and so hot</p>
<p>that it burns away the top soil.</p>
<p>So it actually destroys the fertility of the soil itself.</p>
<p>So the point of this is that human intervention, right?</p>
<p>Even the intention behind North American authorities</p>
<p>managing that forest fire is to create less destruction.</p>
<p>That is the intention,</p>
<p>but the intention is divergent from the outcome.</p>
<p>So in Taliban speak, he would say that human intervention</p>
<p>moves us from mediocre stan into extremist stan.</p>
<p>So mediocre stan would be something much more like nature</p>
<p>where for instance, you can&rsquo;t double your body weight</p>
<p>in a day, probably can&rsquo;t even do it in a year, right?</p>
<p>But in extremist stan,</p>
<p>which is something much more information based,</p>
<p>you can double or send your net worth to zero</p>
<p>in a single trade in a single moment, right?</p>
<p>So when we try and intervene</p>
<p>with natural biological systems</p>
<p>that have these feedback loops,</p>
<p>we actually start to push the system more</p>
<p>to behave more like an extremist stan system</p>
<p>that has less short run volatility,</p>
<p>but more extreme long run volatility.</p>
<p>So, but the question is,</p>
<p>where you look at capitalism or communism, for example,</p>
<p>and by the way, yes,</p>
<p>I will talk to somebody who&rsquo;s a Marxist or a communist,</p>
<p>like Richard Wolff is a pretty eloquent defender</p>
<p>of these ideas because it&rsquo;s always good</p>
<p>to really understand ideas</p>
<p>as opposed to just reject them offhand.</p>
<p>When you look at the system of capitalism</p>
<p>or the system of communism,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s ideals and a lot of people argue</p>
<p>in this perfect form would actually be good for the world.</p>
<p>The question is how resilient are they</p>
<p>to the corruption of human nature?</p>
<p>And I mean, you&rsquo;re saying that there&rsquo;s not a,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s never been a free market.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very true statement.</p>
<p>The question is how resilient is capitalism</p>
<p>or whatever implementations of capitalism</p>
<p>we had up to this point to human nature</p>
<p>where one person will become successful</p>
<p>through legitimate means</p>
<p>and starts to try to manipulate the system</p>
<p>that takes it away from a free market</p>
<p>or takes it away from the things</p>
<p>that gave them the riches in the first place.</p>
<p>And then try to, through corruption, get more,</p>
<p>get this, the thing you said, the lazy human ways.</p>
<p>Now try to figure out how to get something for nothing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So how resilient do you think is capitalism to that?</p>
<p>Well, the best implementation we&rsquo;ve had of it</p>
<p>really has been the United States, I think,</p>
<p>up until this point.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still the central banking itself.</p>
<p>This was in the 1848 Manifesto to the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Measure number five reads an exclusive state monopoly</p>
<p>and centralized control over cash and credit.</p>
<p>So the central bank is a Marxist or communist institution.</p>
<p>It is antithetical to the free market principles</p>
<p>on which the United States was founded.</p>
<p>And indeed, the United States resisted</p>
<p>the implementation of a central bank.</p>
<p>I think it was Andrew Jackson.</p>
<p>I know there was the first national bank,</p>
<p>the second national bank were both disbanded.</p>
<p>And then Andrew Jackson, which is my favorite Tennessean,</p>
<p>he has some famous quotes about routing out the bankers</p>
<p>like a den of vipers.</p>
<p>I think he punched one of the central bankers in the face.</p>
<p>Back when our leaders were a bit more badass,</p>
<p>I guess you might say.</p>
<p>And finally in 1913, the Federal Reserve was implemented.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been kind of all downhill from there.</p>
<p>So what is, can you, oh, sorry, go ahead.</p>
<p>I was just gonna say that communism and capitalism,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also a matter of scale.</p>
<p>The ideal behind communism is from each</p>
<p>according to their ability to each according to their need.</p>
<p>Sounds beautiful, right?</p>
<p>Sounds like a great, peaceful, harmonious way</p>
<p>to organize ourselves.</p>
<p>The problem is, and by the way, I am a communist</p>
<p>in my family, in my home, right?</p>
<p>At that very smallest of scales.</p>
<p>Yes, in your very small circles of trust,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re much more likely to behave selflessly</p>
<p>towards one another.</p>
<p>By the way, I look forward to the Bitcoin community</p>
<p>clipping out that part, saying that Robert Breedlove</p>
<p>was a communist and the ideals of communism are beautiful.</p>
<p>Yeah, context matters, people.</p>
<p>Sorry, go ahead.</p>
<p>But to your point, it does not scale, right?</p>
<p>As we move into this larger system</p>
<p>of socioeconomic cooperation, which is necessary</p>
<p>to deepen the division of labor, to generate more wealth.</p>
<p>We need to interact with one another on much larger scales</p>
<p>than this communistic utopian ideal.</p>
<p>We get into the realm of capitalism</p>
<p>where we need really sound rules, hard rules,</p>
<p>consensus, verifiability, and frankly, prices.</p>
<p>Because the other thing in Soviet Russia</p>
<p>is they tried to replace the profit motive</p>
<p>or the price signal with this devotion to,</p>
<p>this nationalistic faith and devotion.</p>
<p>Where it&rsquo;s like, you don&rsquo;t need self interest anymore.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need prices or profits.</p>
<p>You can just protect Mother Russia, right?</p>
<p>And serve Mother Russia and that would create wealth.</p>
<p>And what happened, right?</p>
<p>They destroyed price signals.</p>
<p>There were shortages, there were famines,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all levels of corruption.</p>
<p>Because to your point, it&rsquo;s once you,</p>
<p>people have to run the system no matter what.</p>
<p>So when people are always pursuing something for nothing</p>
<p>and you put someone in a seat</p>
<p>of much closer to absolute power</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re making all the pricing decisions,</p>
<p>they own all of the productive factors in the economy,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not beholden to any market force.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no market check on their action</p>
<p>that that institution tends to become more corrupt.</p>
<p>And further, it&rsquo;s an inferior resource strategy.</p>
<p>I alluded to this earlier where the other way</p>
<p>to think about free market versus central planning is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s decentralized or distributed computing</p>
<p>versus centralized computing.</p>
<p>So each one of us, I think that the number</p>
<p>is 120 bits per second of active awareness.</p>
<p>And so we can take in, clearly we process a lot more</p>
<p>than that, but our active awareness,</p>
<p>I think is 120 bits per second.</p>
<p>In a centralized planning body like in Soviet Russia,</p>
<p>they had the pricing czar.</p>
<p>Maybe they had 10, 20,000 people deciding the prices</p>
<p>for the entire country.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re only getting that much data throughput, right?</p>
<p>20,000 people times 120 bits per second.</p>
<p>Whereas in a free market, if everyone is free to interact</p>
<p>with deep capital markets based on an accurate price,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting the data throughput of 120 bits per second</p>
<p>times the entire economy, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re getting, it&rsquo;s a more efficient means</p>
<p>for disseminating knowledge effectively.</p>
<p>And then again, knowledge is just,</p>
<p>the more knowledge a socioeconomic structure can contain,</p>
<p>the more wealthy it is, right?</p>
<p>Prices, tools, all these things are just knowledge.</p>
<p>So in that respect, that&rsquo;s why something like capitalism,</p>
<p>even in its marginalized form, state capitalism,</p>
<p>out competes communism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s distributed computing versus centralized computing.</p>
<p>You know, we kind of brought up religion</p>
<p>and Joseph Campbell and myth and the propagation of ideas.</p>
<p>And kind of before I forget,</p>
<p>I wanted to ask your thoughts about this.</p>
<p>You know, Jordan Peterson, I haven&rsquo;t really understood</p>
<p>exactly like be able to pin him down exactly</p>
<p>what he sees as the role of religion in human society.</p>
<p>But it feels like he&rsquo;s describing it as having value for us.</p>
<p>The ideas of myth are valuable.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re valuable mechanisms toward,</p>
<p>I think you mentioned kind of directing us</p>
<p>in this world as a human society.</p>
<p>Do you think about myth?</p>
<p>Do you think about religion?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the use of it in this construct of markets</p>
<p>in this framework of where ideas are ultimately</p>
<p>the fundamental thing that makes societies work?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think Jordan Peterson, who I&rsquo;m a huge fan of,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s been very influential in my thinking</p>
<p>and influential on my own religious views as well.</p>
<p>I think his position would be, and he&rsquo;s said this before,</p>
<p>that he acts as if God exists.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve had some arguments about this before,</p>
<p>but to me that points towards the preeminence of action</p>
<p>and how important action is</p>
<p>versus your cognitive beliefs necessarily.</p>
<p>And I think there is a lot of utility in that,</p>
<p>that if you follow the moral code of something,</p>
<p>like the Bible, you do reap benefits from that.</p>
<p>Society reaps benefits from that.</p>
<p>And sometimes I bring up this point and people are like,</p>
<p>oh my God, are you kidding me?</p>
<p>Have you read the Old Testament?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re clobbering people with rocks</p>
<p>when they do the wrong thing.</p>
<p>The Bible doesn&rsquo;t claim to be this,</p>
<p>like do everything that was done in the Bible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like charting this moral progression</p>
<p>where we came from this very barbaric society</p>
<p>into something more like the New Testament</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re honoring individual sovereignty</p>
<p>above the state and things like that.</p>
<p>So I think that mythology itself</p>
<p>is another form of data compression.</p>
<p>If you look at these stories,</p>
<p>Cain and Abel is a good example,</p>
<p>or Peterson makes the point that it&rsquo;s a tiny story.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a paragraph ish long,</p>
<p>but it contains so many layers of meaning</p>
<p>in regards to violence, to evil, betrayal, work,</p>
<p>the divergence between intention and result,</p>
<p>because I think Cain is actually making,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s making the effort to sacrifice for God,</p>
<p>but the sacrifices he&rsquo;s making are not,</p>
<p>God doesn&rsquo;t find them useful.</p>
<p>And so he sort of rejects them.</p>
<p>Again, if we&rsquo;re organizing these stories</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re organized by these useful fictions, right?</p>
<p>These, these Herarian imagined orders.</p>
<p>I think mythology is kind of the original version of that,</p>
<p>where we were learning to organize ourselves around stories</p>
<p>to best coordinate our action across space and time.</p>
<p>And so I think it&rsquo;s very foundational.</p>
<p>And back to what we were saying in the beginning</p>
<p>that if value truly is fundamental,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s interesting that all these stories</p>
<p>point towards often common moral values.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not perfectly aligned,</p>
<p>but it does speak to just the evolutionary importance</p>
<p>of morality and the subjectivity of morality,</p>
<p>where morality sort of evolves over time based on,</p>
<p>frankly, the capital stock we&rsquo;ve accumulated.</p>
<p>The more capital stock we&rsquo;ve accumulated,</p>
<p>the easier life is, the less barbaric we have to be.</p>
<p>Whereas if we&rsquo;re living in conditions of true scarcity,</p>
<p>then we tend to be a bit more barbaric towards one another.</p>
<p>And that too, to dovetail this</p>
<p>into something largely unrelated,</p>
<p>but I think is really important is inflation.</p>
<p>Inflation by artificially increasing the prices</p>
<p>of goods and services in the world, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re injecting more dollars,</p>
<p>chasing the same level of goods and services.</p>
<p>We are artificially increasing scarcity,</p>
<p>perceived scarcity, right?</p>
<p>And when you increase perceived scarcity,</p>
<p>you are amplifying divisiveness.</p>
<p>The natural state of man is when everything is scarce</p>
<p>and you really have to fight hard</p>
<p>just to eat or drink water that day.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s decivilizing in a way</p>
<p>by artificially amplifying</p>
<p>the perceived scarcity in the world.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate how does inflation increase</p>
<p>the perceived scarcity in the world?</p>
<p>So we could think the price itself is an indication,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a data packet, if you will.</p>
<p>The price is a data packet on supply and demand, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s telling you how much supply there is</p>
<p>of something in the world relative to the demand.</p>
<p>So when you print money</p>
<p>and artificially increase that price,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s diverging away from supply and demand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s becoming just more of a product of policy</p>
<p>than it is of free market fundamentals.</p>
<p>The more expensive something is,</p>
<p>that is a signal to the marketplace and to market actors</p>
<p>that it is scarce, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why a Leonardo painting</p>
<p>might sell for $16 million, there&rsquo;s only one,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of demand for it.</p>
<p>Maybe my numbers are off, but you get the point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the reason mask spiked in price</p>
<p>after the COVID announcement, right?</p>
<p>There was not enough supply,</p>
<p>toilet paper, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>So inflation, and by inflation,</p>
<p>I specifically mean arbitrary fiat currency</p>
<p>supply inflation by legal monopoly,</p>
<p>not inflation is a commonly misunderstood word.</p>
<p>That is amplifying the perception of scarcity</p>
<p>among market actors in the world.</p>
<p>And I would argue that it actually amplifies divisiveness.</p>
<p>I think this is the key maybe to looking at</p>
<p>the connection between the monopolization of money</p>
<p>and things like cancel culture,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s increasing our natural predilection</p>
<p>to be combative with one another,</p>
<p>because we think there&rsquo;s more scarcity in the world</p>
<p>than there actually is,</p>
<p>versus in a world where you&rsquo;re not increasing</p>
<p>the money supply, prices are declining every year.</p>
<p>As prices decline, this is a signal to market actors</p>
<p>and the market that scarcity is declining.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s less need to fight over things.</p>
<p>And all of this ties back into the old Bastiat saying</p>
<p>that if goods don&rsquo;t cross borders, soldiers will.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re not trading with one another,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re not acting interdependently,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not becoming more intelligent as a market,</p>
<p>and that increased intelligence or increased knowledge</p>
<p>is reflected in decreased prices,</p>
<p>because prices are just the exchange ratios of things.</p>
<p>So the smarter we can solve problems,</p>
<p>the better we can solve problems, the less prices would be.</p>
<p>So it induces more cooperation.</p>
<p>I love how you tie inflation and cancel culture together</p>
<p>as essentially artificial creation of increase of conflict.</p>
<p>Artificially increasing scarcity</p>
<p>and thereby artificially increasing conflict.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really fascinating.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re short circuiting my brain</p>
<p>many times throughout this conversation.</p>
<p>Okay, this robot is struggling to keep up.</p>
<p>Okay, maybe to step back at the useful fictions</p>
<p>or pragmatic truths.</p>
<p>Let me ask the question that you&rsquo;ve answered</p>
<p>in many ways already, but let&rsquo;s explicitly look at.</p>
<p>What is money?</p>
<p>Oh, as you know, that&rsquo;s my favorite question.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Is the name of the show I just launched,</p>
<p>the What is Money show?</p>
<p>Clearly, we could say that the Bitcoin rabbit hole</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s led me to explore a lot of these ideas in depth.</p>
<p>And I think as we&rsquo;ve demonstrated today,</p>
<p>it goes well beyond just the economic sphere</p>
<p>when you start to think about things like exchange</p>
<p>and morality and time preference and civilization.</p>
<p>So I love the question, what is money?</p>
<p>I think it is the key to incepting a deeper understanding</p>
<p>of the world into people that if you actually</p>
<p>just start to ask the seemingly simple question,</p>
<p>it surfaces more and more layers of truth.</p>
<p>And I recently, I just wrote a piece,</p>
<p>I think I have 30 something answers to this question.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So sometimes it&rsquo;s actually a more systematic way</p>
<p>of asking the question of what is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some questions that are almost unanswerable,</p>
<p>but in their asking allow you to deeply get closer to truth,</p>
<p>deeply understand the nature of our human existence.</p>
<p>And the meaning of life is almost like</p>
<p>this initial philosophers striving towards that.</p>
<p>If money is indeed as fundamental as you&rsquo;ve described,</p>
<p>especially in the context of value being fundamental,</p>
<p>then that is a really, that&rsquo;s a more,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take a 21st century way of asking the same question</p>
<p>about what is the meaning of life.</p>
<p>You mentioned that it&rsquo;s a meta property</p>
<p>out of the list of many ways to answer that question.</p>
<p>How would you help people to think about that?</p>
<p>Yeah, the first most serious answer</p>
<p>comes from the school of Austrian economics</p>
<p>and it defines money as a universal medium of exchange.</p>
<p>So this would be any good that is used,</p>
<p>held and used purely for purposes of facilitating exchange.</p>
<p>So in the configuration of demand for any particular asset,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s bifurcated between its utility,</p>
<p>which is something a service</p>
<p>that it can render to you in real time,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s, if it&rsquo;s water, you&rsquo;re thirsty,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the utility of water is that it can quench your thirst</p>
<p>whereas the marketability would be the expectation</p>
<p>of future exchange that other people would want this asset</p>
<p>in the future to trade it for whatever they may have.</p>
<p>Money is just going to be the good in any trading economy</p>
<p>that has the highest proportion of marketability</p>
<p>relative to utility.</p>
<p>So today that would be gold.</p>
<p>Gold has utility, it&rsquo;s used in electronics,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s used in dental dentistry and whatnot,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s largely used as a store of value across time</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s been used for for 5,000 years.</p>
<p>So if we say gold has a $10 trillion market cap,</p>
<p>maybe 2 trillion of that is its utility value</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s actually demand for use in computers and dentistry</p>
<p>and an 8 trillion of that is demand</p>
<p>for its use as a store of value.</p>
<p>Money, the marketability aspects of money</p>
<p>boils down to five services that money can render.</p>
<p>Money needs to be divisible, it needs to be durable,</p>
<p>it needs to be recognizable, it needs to be portable</p>
<p>and it needs to be scarce.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll gloss over a lot of history with this</p>
<p>and just say that historically,</p>
<p>money&rsquo;s always been a technology,</p>
<p>still is a technology or a tool.</p>
<p>I use these terms interchangeably</p>
<p>and you think of a technology</p>
<p>as just a more sophisticated tool effectively.</p>
<p>To best satisfy those properties,</p>
<p>monetary metals were determined</p>
<p>to be the most satisfactory tool,</p>
<p>the most divisible, most durable, most recognizable,</p>
<p>most portable tool in the marketplace.</p>
<p>Of the monetary metals, gold was the most scarce</p>
<p>as quantified by either its stock to flow ratio</p>
<p>or its inflation resistance.</p>
<p>So simple way to say this is that people always prefer</p>
<p>the money most resistant to inflation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a nice definition of scarcity in the context.</p>
<p>The money is, if you were to measure it,</p>
<p>the resistance to inflation.</p>
<p>So how hard is it to artificially increase</p>
<p>the supply of the thing?</p>
<p>That is the hardness of money.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why gold is hard money.</p>
<p>Because the alchemy is hard.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Because no one cracked the alchemy.</p>
<p>So gold became money.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s such a nice clean explanation of what is money</p>
<p>with the five elements and gold ultimately won out</p>
<p>because of the last piece of scarcity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And to get to maybe dig a little deeper there.</p>
<p>So scarcity, we commonly think of scarcity</p>
<p>as strictly a supply property,</p>
<p>where if there&rsquo;s not much of something, then it&rsquo;s scarce.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not actually true.</p>
<p>Scarcity occurs when demand exceeds supply.</p>
<p>So when there&rsquo;s more demand than the supply can justify,</p>
<p>the thing becomes an economic good</p>
<p>and it establishes itself a market price.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s more demand for the thing</p>
<p>than the supply can satisfy.</p>
<p>The unique thing about money as a concept at least</p>
<p>is that demand always exceeds supply.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s never enough money to satisfy everyone, right?</p>
<p>Because another definition for money,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the most marketable good.</p>
<p>So it can be traded for any other good service,</p>
<p>piece of knowledge in the marketplace.</p>
<p>So humans being what we are, we&rsquo;re never satisfied, right?</p>
<p>We always want more of something, whatever it may be.</p>
<p>So money as the ultimate token of obtaining that something</p>
<p>is always scarce as a concept.</p>
<p>But the problem with money is that if you can,</p>
<p>as you alluded to, easily increase its supply,</p>
<p>then all of a sudden you can compromise</p>
<p>the scarcity of it over time</p>
<p>and you can rob people through inflation.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why the market settled on gold as money.</p>
<p>And robbing is reallocating the value that I,</p>
<p>so essentially the one property, like why scarcity</p>
<p>is important is it adds a lot more friction</p>
<p>to the reallocation, like through essentially violence</p>
<p>or implied violence.</p>
<p>Well, it prevents it through cost of extraction too.</p>
<p>So if you want to go out and dilute gold holders today,</p>
<p>you have to go out into the world and mine gold.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very expensive process.</p>
<p>That process tends to find equilibrium</p>
<p>where production cost equals the market value of gold.</p>
<p>So if market value is $2,000 an ounce today of gold,</p>
<p>its production cost is going to be around there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the natural market equilibrium.</p>
<p>So that way gold miners cannot just dilute people over time.</p>
<p>Whereas if you look at something like fiat currency,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;re jumping ahead a little bit,</p>
<p>but its production cost is zero.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a reason the market value of fiat currency</p>
<p>historically has always converged to zero</p>
<p>because its production cost is near zero.</p>
<p>So the extension to that question might be</p>
<p>how did we get from gold to paper currency?</p>
<p>And again, this is rooted in the properties of money.</p>
<p>As good as monetary metals were</p>
<p>and as good as gold is as money at holding value across time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s rather limited in terms of portability.</p>
<p>It is not as useful for moving value across space.</p>
<p>This is another definition of money, by the way,</p>
<p>a social device for moving value across space and time.</p>
<p>So to rectify this technological shortcoming of gold,</p>
<p>we introduced, first of all,</p>
<p>the custody of gold was gradually centralized</p>
<p>into fewer and fewer warehousing operations.</p>
<p>This is because there are economies of scale</p>
<p>associated with using gold as money.</p>
<p>And that if you centralize the custody,</p>
<p>the warehouse owner can then issue a paper receipt</p>
<p>called a warehouse receipt for that gold.</p>
<p>And then market participants can trade that paper</p>
<p>as if it&rsquo;s good as gold.</p>
<p>And everyone has an option at any time</p>
<p>to go and redeem real gold from the warehouse.</p>
<p>So that system works until the problem with it</p>
<p>is that it introduces the need to trust the custodian.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s introducing counterparty risk</p>
<p>in the form of the custodian.</p>
<p>And now should that warehouse choose</p>
<p>to increase the supply of paper notes to gold</p>
<p>beyond its supply.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s got three tons of gold</p>
<p>and it issues six tons worth of paper receipts,</p>
<p>all of a sudden it&rsquo;s participating in a fraud.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically lying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s representing that it has more gold</p>
<p>than it actually does.</p>
<p>And that is the pathway that we got into banking</p>
<p>and central banking,</p>
<p>is we needed a convenience mechanism</p>
<p>to rectify the portability shortcomings of gold.</p>
<p>We needed to be able to move value across space, right?</p>
<p>Gold was doing a great job at moving value over time,</p>
<p>but not space.</p>
<p>Paper currency gave us the ability</p>
<p>to move value across space,</p>
<p>but it introduced this attack vector</p>
<p>for warehouse operators, which became banks,</p>
<p>which became central banks,</p>
<p>to modify the supply to suit their own political agendas.</p>
<p>Added the snooze button.</p>
<p>That allows you to do a little fraud.</p>
<p>To get something for nothing.</p>
<p>Something, just a little bit at first.</p>
<p>Just this one morning, just a little bit.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if you can speak</p>
<p>to the birth of fiat currency.</p>
<p>Is there some interesting characteristics</p>
<p>to those early steps that created it?</p>
<p>Like, could it have been averted?</p>
<p>Or is this the natural progression of governments?</p>
<p>You know, what&rsquo;s funny is that central banking</p>
<p>was initially designed to be the custodian of gold, right?</p>
<p>And so they were going to custody the gold,</p>
<p>issue paper on top of it,</p>
<p>and then they would maintain,</p>
<p>you could trust the public stamp effectively.</p>
<p>You could trust that the central bank</p>
<p>had as much gold on reserve as they said they had,</p>
<p>and they were supposed to be the trustworthy institution.</p>
<p>So we went from placing our trust</p>
<p>in a free market game theoretic process,</p>
<p>or trusting gold,</p>
<p>and we began trusting this institution instead.</p>
<p>This, that institution would not have arisen</p>
<p>if the portability of gold was really high.</p>
<p>If we could have somehow sent gold</p>
<p>across a telecommunications channel,</p>
<p>there would have been no need for a central bank.</p>
<p>Everyone could have custodyed their gold</p>
<p>in any information bearing medium, frankly,</p>
<p>and they could beam it around the world at any time.</p>
<p>So this whole institution itself</p>
<p>is rooted in a technological shortcoming of gold.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s, another way to think about that</p>
<p>is maybe had there been all the gold in the world today</p>
<p>fills two Olympic sized swimming pools,</p>
<p>all the gold mined throughout all of human history.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s not a lot, right?</p>
<p>What if there had been just like way more?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d just been, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>20,000 Olympic swimming pools worth.</p>
<p>Portability wouldn&rsquo;t have been as much of an issue, right?</p>
<p>We could have, and this is to say,</p>
<p>assuming gold was still the most scarce metal</p>
<p>and all these things,</p>
<p>portability would have been less of an issue.</p>
<p>We would have had less dependence</p>
<p>or need for a central bank.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s kind of idiosyncratic</p>
<p>in that we just happened to end up here on this planet</p>
<p>with a certain amount of gold.</p>
<p>It best satisfied the properties of money.</p>
<p>And a certain amount of humans,</p>
<p>a geographic dispersed such that portability</p>
<p>had certain properties that you want to achieve</p>
<p>for humans in the geographical space</p>
<p>to be able to be a exchange value.</p>
<p>It became more of an issue as we globalized, right?</p>
<p>As we became more of a global society,</p>
<p>we needed money that could move across space really fast.</p>
<p>So we could trade in international capital markets.</p>
<p>So that drove the central bank</p>
<p>to become the dominant institution of the world.</p>
<p>And if you follow the flows of gold throughout history,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;ve been watching this documentary</p>
<p>on World War I and World War II on Netflix.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s called World War II in Color.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, that&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>When I say gold has been the governor of governments</p>
<p>or gold is geopolitical money,</p>
<p>like it is the base layer operating system,</p>
<p>has been the base layer operating system for analog society.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s always been about who controls the gold,</p>
<p>is who makes the rules.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, in that context,</p>
<p>is why Bitcoin is so interesting</p>
<p>because it is the disruptor to</p>
<p>this base level operating system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s functioned for all of human history.</p>
<p>I think this is a good place to ask,</p>
<p>we asked the what is money question.</p>
<p>What is Bitcoin?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a question as complicated as what is money?</p>
<p>I think if you get a general understanding of money</p>
<p>from a number of angles,</p>
<p>that we could say Bitcoin is the most superior</p>
<p>monetary technology that has ever existed.</p>
<p>So one of the most superior implementation</p>
<p>of the ideas of money that you talked about,</p>
<p>you talked about money as speech,</p>
<p>you talked about money as an idea,</p>
<p>we talked about money as sovereignty.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re attaching the concept of money, to your point,</p>
<p>to whatever tool best satisfies those properties of money</p>
<p>or best renders those services we need for money.</p>
<p>And as you said, you&rsquo;re using the word tool</p>
<p>and technology interchangeably here.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>And another thing to think about here is that</p>
<p>we think often in terms of goods or services,</p>
<p>but actually everything is a service.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not the physical properties of this pen</p>
<p>that I find valuable,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the services that it renders to me,</p>
<p>that I want to write a letter,</p>
<p>this serves me by allowing me to lay ink on paper</p>
<p>and communicate information.</p>
<p>So value, humans attach value as we alluded to earlier,</p>
<p>two services, not goods.</p>
<p>So the properties or the services that money renders</p>
<p>that human beings value are those five properties,</p>
<p>divisibility, durability,</p>
<p>recognizability, portability, scarcity.</p>
<p>Metals best satisfied those services historically,</p>
<p>but Bitcoin as the most superior monetary technology</p>
<p>in human history, essentially perfects them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as close to perfection as we&rsquo;ve ever been.</p>
<p>So in terms of divisibility,</p>
<p>each Bitcoin can be broken down into 100 million subunits</p>
<p>called a satoshi.</p>
<p>If that divisibility were ever a problem,</p>
<p>which actually there was a question that came up recently,</p>
<p>if you divide the world population</p>
<p>by the total supply of Bitcoin,</p>
<p>you end up at like 0.3 Bitcoin per person,</p>
<p>call it 300,000 satoshis per person.</p>
<p>What if that was not enough to facilitate economic activity?</p>
<p>And the answer to that is Bitcoin can soft fork</p>
<p>into further divisibility.</p>
<p>So if Bitcoin ate all the money in the world</p>
<p>and the average Bitcoin or wealth</p>
<p>will say 300,000 satoshis each,</p>
<p>but that wasn&rsquo;t divisible enough maybe to buy coffee</p>
<p>and do all these day to day transactions,</p>
<p>what would happen?</p>
<p>Well, we would increase its divisibility.</p>
<p>So Bitcoin&rsquo;s perfected divisibility,</p>
<p>the divisibility of money,</p>
<p>lets us transact across scales, right?</p>
<p>We can buy coffee or we can buy a house.</p>
<p>Durability is an interesting one.</p>
<p>So clearly something like gold is very durable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s resistant to degradation over time.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is just pure information,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s stored in a distributed format.</p>
<p>So information stored in a distributed fashion</p>
<p>tends to be virtually infinitely durable.</p>
<p>The example I&rsquo;d like to give here</p>
<p>is something like the Bible.</p>
<p>The Bible is just distributed information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s stored everywhere and nowhere, so to speak.</p>
<p>And for that reason, it has outlasted empires.</p>
<p>And Bitcoin&rsquo;s similar, right?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t make changes to it unilaterally.</p>
<p>But to make explicit the ways in which it is not durable</p>
<p>is the fact that it relies on computing infrastructure.</p>
<p>Like it needs computers.</p>
<p>So if you were to destroy all the computers in the world,</p>
<p>it needs mechanisms that store and transfer information.</p>
<p>And so you could attack it.</p>
<p>I mean, you could attack gold in the same kind of way,</p>
<p>I suppose, through the physics,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s probably easier to destroy</p>
<p>all the computers in the world</p>
<p>than it is to destroy all the gold in the world.</p>
<p>Maybe not, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Maybe, I&rsquo;m not sure which one would be harder to destroy.</p>
<p>The other thing is there&rsquo;s a dynamic incentive.</p>
<p>So every time you destroy Bitcoin miners,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re creating incentives for anyone else</p>
<p>with access to electricity to mine</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re making the algorithm easier.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the destruction is difficult</p>
<p>because of the decentralized nature of the whole thing.</p>
<p>And the difficulty adjustment.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you&rsquo;re gonna have to use nuclear weapons</p>
<p>and cover the whole globe, but anyway.</p>
<p>Yeah, and by then,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got much bigger problems than money, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, so okay, so that&rsquo;s durability.</p>
<p>So portability, Bitcoin&rsquo;s pure information,</p>
<p>it can move at the speed of light,</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t get much faster than that.</p>
<p>Recognizability refers to the ability</p>
<p>to verify the veracity of the money or its authenticity.</p>
<p>So you can actually, when we used to transact gold,</p>
<p>there were time honored techniques for verifying</p>
<p>that it was gold and not gold plated lead, for instance.</p>
<p>This is where we get the term sound money.</p>
<p>A gold coin made a very particular sound</p>
<p>when dropped from a certain height.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve seen people biting coins.</p>
<p>These are all techniques for testing the authenticity of gold.</p>
<p>And with Bitcoin, we have something unique</p>
<p>in that if you&rsquo;re running a full node,</p>
<p>you can verify that the Bitcoin is Bitcoin, right?</p>
<p>It cannot be tampered with, it cannot be faked.</p>
<p>And in addition to that, as a node operator,</p>
<p>you can audit the total supply of Bitcoin at any time,</p>
<p>which is unlike any money in history.</p>
<p>So you know with full certainty,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re holding 1000 Bitcoin,</p>
<p>you have 1000 out of a possible 21 million forever.</p>
<p>You have a guaranteed fraction of the total supply.</p>
<p>Yeah, so a full node contains information</p>
<p>about every transaction that&rsquo;s ever been had</p>
<p>so you can figure out, yeah, I mean,</p>
<p>all the truth of this money is all right there.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like a fractal constituent</p>
<p>of the whole network, right?</p>
<p>The whole Bitcoin blockchain is comprised in a node too.</p>
<p>Not the proof of work piece,</p>
<p>but the entire transaction history.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s unique as well.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what makes Bitcoin the ultimate store of value</p>
<p>is that you know with certainty what the total supply is</p>
<p>and will ever be.</p>
<p>And you know that your share of that supply is fixed.</p>
<p>It cannot change.</p>
<p>It can only improve actually.</p>
<p>If someone loses, you know,</p>
<p>if the Satoshi stash is truly gone forever,</p>
<p>the million Bitcoin never moves,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re talking about 1000 Bitcoin</p>
<p>out of 20 million instead and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>As more people lose access to their Bitcoin,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re basically making a contribution to everyone else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s anti dilutive.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s certain properties of Bitcoin</p>
<p>that are sort of a little bit more into the details</p>
<p>that ensure that the full nodes,</p>
<p>like the size of all the transactions that ever happened,</p>
<p>at least currently can be stored</p>
<p>in a single computer, for example.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t blow up too quickly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But you know, there&rsquo;s arguments that that&rsquo;s not necessarily,</p>
<p>you can make arguments for that to be a very nice property,</p>
<p>but you can also say that there&rsquo;s like drawbacks to it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hence the block size debates</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was the Bitcoin Cash Civil War, right?</p>
<p>Was that particular piece.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And, you know, ostensibly they were saying,</p>
<p>oh, we need more transaction throughput</p>
<p>to buy more coffee and do more transactions.</p>
<p>But what they were actually doing</p>
<p>was increasing the size computing power necessary</p>
<p>to run a full node,</p>
<p>which would have theoretically compromised decentralization.</p>
<p>So yeah, but it would in theory,</p>
<p>and this is, you know, in theory,</p>
<p>it would allow you to have much more transactions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But the drawback, it would,</p>
<p>because of no longer can be stored in a single computer,</p>
<p>personal computer, then it naturally leads</p>
<p>to the centralization.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Which you see with gold.</p>
<p>Which would have compromised its survivability.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So, I said, what else is there?</p>
<p>The last one, which leads straight into this one,</p>
<p>actually is the most important one of money,</p>
<p>which is scarcity.</p>
<p>And that you need to know the supply is fixed</p>
<p>and safeguarded from counterfeiting and inflation,</p>
<p>which counterfeiting and inflation are the same thing,</p>
<p>by the way.</p>
<p>Counterfeiting is criminalized inflation.</p>
<p>Inflation is legalized counterfeiting.</p>
<p>So central banks today,</p>
<p>when they say they&rsquo;re printing money, they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re counterfeiting currency.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very important part.</p>
<p>And Bitcoin, as I&rsquo;ve argued in some of my writing,</p>
<p>is more than just an invention.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually the discovery of absolute scarcity.</p>
<p>And that we have unveiled a property of money</p>
<p>that we will only discover once, and it&rsquo;s got really</p>
<p>major ramifications for the world at large.</p>
<p>So with gold, for instance, as we&rsquo;ve covered,</p>
<p>it became money because it was the most relatively scarce</p>
<p>monetary metal, right?</p>
<p>Its supply was hardest to increase over time.</p>
<p>However, if we could somehow flip a switch today</p>
<p>and make everyone in the world go out and start mining gold,</p>
<p>we could increase the supply much more quickly.</p>
<p>We could, you know, it&rsquo;s historic inflation rates</p>
<p>about 2%, we could double that pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, with Bitcoin, it is not possible.</p>
<p>So no matter how much effort and energy and capital</p>
<p>and operational expenditure we pour into the mining network,</p>
<p>we cannot deviate from its fixed</p>
<p>and diminishing supply curve from between now</p>
<p>and the last Bitcoin being mined in 2140</p>
<p>because of the difficulty adjustment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s constantly, it&rsquo;s adapting to human action actually.</p>
<p>So the harder we pursue it, the more that it recedes,</p>
<p>and then the less we pursue it,</p>
<p>the more available it makes itself.</p>
<p>And this is, it&rsquo;s a real major breakthrough</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the closest thing to perfect information</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve ever had in an economy.</p>
<p>And perfect information is this, it&rsquo;s a theoretical,</p>
<p>but unattainable state of the market where all market actors</p>
<p>have all the relevant information about everything</p>
<p>so that they can compete as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>And in a state of pure information, we have,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, perfect information, we have perfect competition.</p>
<p>And in perfect competition, we maximize wealth generation.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re competing as freely as possible</p>
<p>from coercive and violent impediments.</p>
<p>And so I think Bitcoin in that sense</p>
<p>is going to pull the world closer to a state</p>
<p>of perfect competition than we&rsquo;ve ever been before,</p>
<p>which would increase wealth generation</p>
<p>to an extent we&rsquo;ve never seen before.</p>
<p>Many of the things you said about Bitcoin</p>
<p>also hold for other cryptocurrency technologies</p>
<p>that followed after.</p>
<p>Can you say something to why you think Bitcoin</p>
<p>is the superior technology</p>
<p>from a pragmatic truth perspective than say Ethereum,</p>
<p>but also other crypto, like Bitcoin Cash,</p>
<p>like other hard forks of Bitcoin,</p>
<p>and maybe things that might yet to be invented,</p>
<p>tools yet to be invented?</p>
<p>Yeah, so this is a good point of argument</p>
<p>because a lot of people have countered me and said,</p>
<p>Bitcoin cannot be absolute scarcity</p>
<p>because you can fork it and create something</p>
<p>with the same properties as Bitcoin</p>
<p>or potentially even better properties, right?</p>
<p>You create something with a deflationary monetary policy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Bitcoin Cash was actually.</p>
<p>It forked Bitcoin with all of the same properties</p>
<p>except for the block size that we alluded to earlier.</p>
<p>The problem is that money is valued.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s the good with a configuration of demand</p>
<p>that is predominantly marketability.</p>
<p>So it is valued based on its liquidity.</p>
<p>That is how many other trading partners are there</p>
<p>in that monetary network.</p>
<p>So it is a network valued because of its liquidity</p>
<p>and network effects.</p>
<p>So any new entrant into the market for money</p>
<p>is incentivized to always choose the money</p>
<p>with the deepest liquidity and the most network effects.</p>
<p>This is why money has tended to be a winner take all market</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s essentially a single purpose tool, right?</p>
<p>It is a tool for,</p>
<p>if we consider that tools are time saving devices, right?</p>
<p>The shovel that you dig more holes per man hour</p>
<p>than you can with your bare hands.</p>
<p>Money is a tool, there&rsquo;s yet another definition of money</p>
<p>that lets us calculate, negotiate</p>
<p>and execute trades more quickly.</p>
<p>So that function tends to coalesce</p>
<p>towards one solution.</p>
<p>And so the short answer would be that</p>
<p>for the same reasons, quantifiable reasons, right?</p>
<p>Like inflation resistance and liquidity and network effects</p>
<p>that we have one analog gold,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re only likely to have one digital gold.</p>
<p>And I think the Bitcoin Cash Fork</p>
<p>proves that out empirically.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good case study because.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s one case study, right?</p>
<p>But okay, so that&rsquo;s really well put.</p>
<p>So like gold was sticky.</p>
<p>Once it was accepted, the network effects,</p>
<p>the winner take all took over.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s a fundamentally different kind of like</p>
<p>analog versus digital is a leap in technologies.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re suggesting that there may not be,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s unlikely to be other leaps of that kind</p>
<p>into a whole nother kind of space of technologies.</p>
<p>I would argue that Bitcoin,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like the ideological synthesis of gold,</p>
<p>taking the monetary properties of gold</p>
<p>and combining them with the internet itself.</p>
<p>And in doing so,</p>
<p>it has essentially perfected the properties of money, right?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t get more divisible, durable, recognizable,</p>
<p>portable, or scarce than Bitcoin.</p>
<p>So Satoshi has kind of,</p>
<p>he left no design space for a superior technology</p>
<p>to intercede and out compete Bitcoin at this point.</p>
<p>Now that it&rsquo;s established liquidity</p>
<p>in the network effects. Far superior technology, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s a combination of the tech itself</p>
<p>and the social layer that is coalesced to it.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t separate those two out.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re all connected and then the political as well.</p>
<p>I mean, but the portability, for example,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another way to phrase that is the,</p>
<p>what is it, the scaling.</p>
<p>So the number of transactions,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a limitation for Bitcoin</p>
<p>that many argue is a feature, many argue is a bug.</p>
<p>You have a bunch of cryptocurrency technologies</p>
<p>that are able to achieve much higher,</p>
<p>much faster frequency of transactions,</p>
<p>much more transactions, you know, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on that?</p>
<p>You know, the low level of transactions</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s possible with Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s a feature?</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s a bug?</p>
<p>Necessary for security actually.</p>
<p>And even these other crypto assets that settle more quickly,</p>
<p>they settle with less assurance of finality.</p>
<p>So Nick Carter has a great piece on this actually called,</p>
<p>the settlement assurance is stupid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really good where the gist of it is</p>
<p>that there is more work being done in each block of Bitcoin</p>
<p>that it can&rsquo;t, it is less vulnerable to reversion.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s giving you higher degrees of assurance</p>
<p>that your settlement or your trade has occurred</p>
<p>with finality, whereas other blockchains</p>
<p>are much more vulnerable.</p>
<p>And again, with Bitcoin, the evolutionary path of money</p>
<p>with gold is that it was first used as a collectible.</p>
<p>It then became used as a store value.</p>
<p>After it had stored enough value,</p>
<p>it began to be used as a medium of exchange.</p>
<p>And then finally, when it was used widely enough</p>
<p>as a medium of exchange, it becomes a unit of account.</p>
<p>We actually start to think in the money.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s following a similar path.</p>
<p>So started out as kind of a collectible.</p>
<p>Today, I would argue it&rsquo;s a store value,</p>
<p>one of the most effective store value we&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>So that evolutionary path that Bitcoin&rsquo;s following</p>
<p>is similar to gold.</p>
<p>First a collectible, today a store value.</p>
<p>To be an effective store value,</p>
<p>it has to optimize for supply cap.</p>
<p>That has to be the first,</p>
<p>and this is all Bitcoin really needs to do</p>
<p>to be successful by the way.</p>
<p>Exactly what it&rsquo;s been doing for 12 years,</p>
<p>virtually flawlessly,</p>
<p>which is keep creating a block every 10 minutes</p>
<p>and keep enforcing a supply cap of 21 million.</p>
<p>As long as those two things hold,</p>
<p>it is sound money, the ultimate sound money,</p>
<p>the most inflation resistant money there&rsquo;s ever been.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually completely immune.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taken unexpected inflation to 0%.</p>
<p>We know with perfect certainty</p>
<p>what Bitcoin supply will ever be.</p>
<p>For it to be used more broadly as a medium of exchange,</p>
<p>it can&rsquo;t make trade offs at the base layer</p>
<p>to increase its portability for instance.</p>
<p>Even though portability is maybe kind of a misnomer</p>
<p>because Bitcoin has extremely high portability,</p>
<p>just doesn&rsquo;t have extremely high transaction throughput.</p>
<p>So we could say you can move it pretty quickly</p>
<p>anywhere in the world</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re willing to bid up for the block space,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t satisfy all the world&rsquo;s economic volume.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do 300 million transactions per second</p>
<p>like you can on a centralized database like Visa.</p>
<p>But Bitcoin needs to be this,</p>
<p>it has to be a store value first</p>
<p>before it can be a medium of exchange.</p>
<p>So it has to protect the supply cap first</p>
<p>before making any trade offs for that.</p>
<p>And I would argue that that&rsquo;s why Bitcoin is so rigid,</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s optimized for survivability</p>
<p>and optimized for that supply cap.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s pushing experimentation and other features</p>
<p>that would increase its transaction throughput</p>
<p>to higher layers.</p>
<p>So I think Lightning Network</p>
<p>is something that&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still early,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of throughput already being used</p>
<p>on the Lightning Network.</p>
<p>And it makes some slight trade offs</p>
<p>in terms of the trust minimization of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>You end up trusting these smart contracts</p>
<p>instead of move the Bitcoin,</p>
<p>but you pick up nearly unlimited transaction throughput.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how, and that&rsquo;s how biology evolves.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how the internet evolved.</p>
<p>It evolves in layers.</p>
<p>So I think Bitcoin,</p>
<p>you can sort of conceive of it</p>
<p>as the latest layer to the internet.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one that preserves this store value property</p>
<p>better than any asset we&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
<p>Let me ask sort of a critical question of,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re wrong about your statements about Bitcoin,</p>
<p>and you find out years from now that you were wrong,</p>
<p>what would that look like?</p>
<p>What would be the things</p>
<p>that make you realize you were wrong?</p>
<p>Likely ideas or crazy out there ideas?</p>
<p>Do you think about this kind of stuff?</p>
<p>All the time.</p>
<p>Because you speak very confidently about Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And one of the things, let me put it this way.</p>
<p>I think certainty,</p>
<p>I feel like that&rsquo;s like a stoic statement.</p>
<p>Certainty leads to ruin, something like that.</p>
<p>Like certainty, I think is an antithesis to progress often.</p>
<p>And especially in your writing,</p>
<p>but this is true for the Bitcoin community.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certainty about the Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And that makes me very skeptical,</p>
<p>no matter how good the ideas are.</p>
<p>Whenever things are good, this might be the Russian in me.</p>
<p>I think like, what are the ways this is gonna go wrong?</p>
<p>So what do you think are the ways this might go wrong</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re wrong in your conception of what Bitcoin is?</p>
<p>Yeah, so science evolves via negativa,</p>
<p>meaning that we&rsquo;re not proving hypotheses</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what becomes the body of science.</p>
<p>Science is whatever is left over as we disprove hypotheses.</p>
<p>Whatever we can empirically, through experimentation,</p>
<p>disprove, gets discarded.</p>
<p>And whatever remains, whatever theory remains,</p>
<p>it hasn&rsquo;t been disproven, is science, effectively.</p>
<p>This process is similar to market actors zeroing in</p>
<p>on a store value, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re experimenting with different forms</p>
<p>of storing wealth across time.</p>
<p>Some do better than others</p>
<p>and eventually everyone ends up on the one that is best.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what gold was.</p>
<p>In terms of understanding Bitcoin,</p>
<p>I look at it as a similar approach.</p>
<p>And that is the main question I&rsquo;m asking myself</p>
<p>is how do you stop this thing?</p>
<p>How do you turn it off?</p>
<p>How do you end it?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a nation state, particularly,</p>
<p>who has the most to lose in this transition,</p>
<p>what is the attack vector by which they neutralize Bitcoin?</p>
<p>I mean, that is the $250 trillion question.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve spent five years thinking about this thing</p>
<p>very deeply.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read everything on monetary history.</p>
<p>I can get my hands on.</p>
<p>The general thought of how it is stopped,</p>
<p>and this is the snag point that a lot of people get to</p>
<p>in their explorations down the rabbit hole,</p>
<p>is they just say the government will never allow it.</p>
<p>And that becomes kind of their bottom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, all right, Bitcoin&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s superior money, blah, blah, blah,</p>
<p>but the government will never allow it.</p>
<p>And they say.</p>
<p>Was Ray Dalio, did he say that?</p>
<p>Dalio was currently stuck there, yeah.</p>
<p>So Ray Dalio said that Bitcoin seems to be too promising.</p>
<p>If it is in fact as promising as it looks,</p>
<p>governments are going to,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t forget what the exact quote is,</p>
<p>but not allowed.</p>
<p>Ban it.</p>
<p>Governments will ban it.</p>
<p>So how do you get Ray Dalio unstuck from your perspective?</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>And how do you get unstuck from that idea</p>
<p>that governments, will governments,</p>
<p>how do you prevent governments from stopping a thing</p>
<p>that threatens centralized power?</p>
<p>Well, Bitcoin is an idea.</p>
<p>So governments that are really good</p>
<p>at fighting centralized threats to their power, right?</p>
<p>Whether that&rsquo;s a currency counterfeiter</p>
<p>or competing nation state or business they don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>or an individual they don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>you know, they can kill them, they can throw them in jail.</p>
<p>They can use any number of course</p>
<p>of a violent tactics to suppress it.</p>
<p>But how do you point a gun at an idea?</p>
<p>How do you coerce an idea?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, you know, there&rsquo;s some anecdotal history here</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s the PGP case, which in the United States,</p>
<p>the court was trying to classify it as munitions.</p>
<p>When we were shipping this</p>
<p>pretty good privacy software overseas,</p>
<p>government wanted to classify it as munitions</p>
<p>and restrict that exportation.</p>
<p>But, and this was a circuit court case precedent.</p>
<p>When the PGP attorneys actually printed out the source code</p>
<p>on paper and presented it as evidence in the court,</p>
<p>all of a sudden it became protected under freedom of speech</p>
<p>and that it&rsquo;s just code is speech, code is language.</p>
<p>And therefore, at least in the United States,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s protected under the first amendment.</p>
<p>I think a government ban would be largely unenforceable,</p>
<p>frankly, on Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Being that it&rsquo;s pure information,</p>
<p>if you suppress market actors</p>
<p>from using it in one jurisdiction,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just creating incentives for them to go elsewhere.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re actually increasing the incentive</p>
<p>for other jurisdictions to be favorable towards it</p>
<p>because then they can create,</p>
<p>they get to benefit from the tax revenue</p>
<p>and the businesses and the innovation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s occurring in and around Bitcoin as a result.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t think if a particular central bank,</p>
<p>like in Europe or United States,</p>
<p>bans it, not maybe using those terms,</p>
<p>but in some kind of way,</p>
<p>you think that provides a really strong incentive</p>
<p>for the other big players to enable it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And that they&rsquo;re more likely, by the way,</p>
<p>and governments know this, by the way, too.</p>
<p>The other thing that causes a government</p>
<p>to shoot itself in the foot is that if they ban something,</p>
<p>they draw a lot of attention to it.</p>
<p>People are smart.</p>
<p>I mean, people ask why, why would a government ban it?</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t I use this?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of typically be the last arrow</p>
<p>in their quiver.</p>
<p>They may try to ban it if Bitcoin</p>
<p>really starts to monetize very quickly.</p>
<p>And the power structures that they impose today</p>
<p>start to dissolve faster than others might think they will,</p>
<p>then they might try and ban it.</p>
<p>But I think that ban will be largely unenforceable.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re more likely to tax it,</p>
<p>which they already do tax it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re likely to increase taxation of it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re likely to try and make it more white market</p>
<p>by actually tracing Bitcoin, seeing who has it,</p>
<p>attaching identities to Bitcoin ownership,</p>
<p>and making sure that they&rsquo;re getting their pound of flesh</p>
<p>on all the transactions it results in.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think, the other thing about this is,</p>
<p>so we saw the internet outcompete intranets,</p>
<p>in that we&rsquo;d say that open source networks</p>
<p>tend to outcompete closed source networks.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a really good reason for this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because in a closed source network,</p>
<p>there are costs associated with defending the network itself.</p>
<p>So you have to, the network owners,</p>
<p>the owners of the closed source network</p>
<p>have to expend resources protecting it from competitors.</p>
<p>And they have to expend resources imposing its rules</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not voluntarily adopted rules.</p>
<p>So you actually have to impose these rule sets.</p>
<p>Whereas an open source network,</p>
<p>which is something much more akin to capitalism</p>
<p>in its pure sense, these are voluntarily adopted rules.</p>
<p>So all market participants have agreed</p>
<p>and consented to this rule set.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no enforcement costs</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no turf protection</p>
<p>because anyone can freely enter or exit the open network.</p>
<p>For that energetic reason,</p>
<p>I think open networks outcompete close networks typically.</p>
<p>And in the digital age, that&rsquo;s why I think open,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why internet outcompetes intranet</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why open source networks</p>
<p>are gonna eat closed source networks.</p>
<p>So what Bitcoin would be in that lens</p>
<p>is the ultimate open source monetary network</p>
<p>devouring closed source central bank monetary networks.</p>
<p>And I just don&rsquo;t see how there&rsquo;s no possibility</p>
<p>of unilaterally stopping Bitcoin or destroying it.</p>
<p>So then they&rsquo;re more likely to regulate or tax it.</p>
<p>And again, the other fallacy here</p>
<p>is that a lot of people tend to think of governments</p>
<p>as these singular indivisible entities,</p>
<p>like they just move under one plan.</p>
<p>But in reality, it&rsquo;s a lot of people, right?</p>
<p>A lot of people with loosely coupled interests</p>
<p>and agendas and whatnot, regulators and others</p>
<p>whether wearing their citizen hat,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna see this thing monetizing,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna be on the front lines</p>
<p>of trying to regulate it, trying to control it.</p>
<p>And I think what&rsquo;s likely to happen</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re gonna start to adopt it,</p>
<p>to buy some of it even as an individual</p>
<p>or possibly even ultimately at a central bank</p>
<p>or sovereign wealth fund level,</p>
<p>as an insurance policy against its success.</p>
<p>And once you start to acquire something</p>
<p>and then you have a vested economic interest</p>
<p>in its monetization,</p>
<p>I think it kind of dissolves any of the power structures</p>
<p>that are arrayed against it from the inside.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve written a lot about this</p>
<p>in a new series called Sovereignism,</p>
<p>which is based loosely on a book</p>
<p>called The Sovereign Individual.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the general thesis</p>
<p>is that microprocessing technology would devour</p>
<p>our organizational models,</p>
<p>the most important of which is the nation state.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;re going into this world</p>
<p>where coercion and violence is just much less rewarding.</p>
<p>The economics of violence are declining</p>
<p>because of the low cost of protecting property, right?</p>
<p>You can now protect your monetary property in Bitcoin</p>
<p>at orders of magnitude less cost</p>
<p>than is necessary to run a banking network.</p>
<p>So it changes the way we organize ourselves.</p>
<p>And again, zooming back to gold</p>
<p>as kind of the original governor to governments,</p>
<p>where if they manipulated the money,</p>
<p>gold would leave their country.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why governments have taken relatively concerted action</p>
<p>to go off of the gold standard.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great book on this called The Gold Wars</p>
<p>that outlines how governments have been waging</p>
<p>a cold war against gold for the past 50 years.</p>
<p>Bitcoin sort of renews hope</p>
<p>for that free market governor of governments.</p>
<p>And that is this digital gold</p>
<p>that governments cannot stop or coopt.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s something,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s such a big deal</p>
<p>is that it is changing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a new useful fiction, you might say.</p>
<p>A useful fiction that&rsquo;s superordinate</p>
<p>to the mythology of the nation state and government</p>
<p>as the dominant institution in the world.</p>
<p>Well, I hope you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>that all forms of centralized power</p>
<p>start breaking apart naturally.</p>
<p>So governments, the more and more power</p>
<p>is given to the individual, whatever the technology is.</p>
<p>And Bitcoin seems to be a promising technology</p>
<p>that empowers that, enables that.</p>
<p>That seems to be the trend.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a promising trend</p>
<p>at least from a perspective of somebody</p>
<p>who values this particular biological meat bag</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s full of consciousness.</p>
<p>I think Bitcoin is exposing the greatest scam</p>
<p>in human history, which is political authority.</p>
<p>Like who gives anyone the right to be politically,</p>
<p>have political authority over anyone else?</p>
<p>People should be free to adopt the rules</p>
<p>and systems and tools that best suit their needs.</p>
<p>And that arc of history we covered earlier</p>
<p>where as socioeconomic systems have become more favorable</p>
<p>towards individual sovereignty,</p>
<p>the more wealthy we have become,</p>
<p>the more we have given the individual,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve maximized individual choice,</p>
<p>the more wealth that society has created</p>
<p>and the more it has out competed</p>
<p>the systems that have come before it.</p>
<p>The latest would be capitalism triumphing over socialism.</p>
<p>Before maybe we eat, you are in Texas,</p>
<p>you brought over some brisket.</p>
<p>Before we may be indulge in that,</p>
<p>let me bring up one quick topic</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll take a break.</p>
<p>And the topic of what some may term</p>
<p>the toxicity of the Bitcoin community.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve written that Bitcoin toxicity is tough love.</p>
<p>Do you wanna break that apart a little bit</p>
<p>sort of the idea, the philosophy of the toxicity</p>
<p>that seems to be present in part in the Bitcoin community?</p>
<p>Yeah, we were talking about this a little bit</p>
<p>before we recorded and I&rsquo;ve been through the gauntlet</p>
<p>with Bitcoin toxicity as well.</p>
<p>I came into this space professionally in 2017.</p>
<p>I was originally running a multi strategy</p>
<p>crypto asset hedge fund.</p>
<p>And my initial investment thesis on the world</p>
<p>was that Bitcoin was a big deal,</p>
<p>but there were all these other exciting coins</p>
<p>and projects and ways the technology was going to be used.</p>
<p>And that view of reality met this immune,</p>
<p>I guess you could say as an ideological immune system,</p>
<p>this Bitcoin toxicity and that it&rsquo;s kind of a filter</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s trying to catch bad or useless</p>
<p>or even scamming ideas that this space is very well known for.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve touched on today, Bitcoin, in my opinion,</p>
<p>is this world shattering innovation,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s in a sea of the most scammy stuff ever, right?</p>
<p>People, anybody can go and create a coin.</p>
<p>So you can go and launch one immediately online</p>
<p>and you can throw up a website, an advisor page,</p>
<p>post a white paper talking about</p>
<p>how great your technology is gonna be</p>
<p>and how it&rsquo;s gonna change the world.</p>
<p>And then you can raise $30 million in Bitcoin</p>
<p>or Ethereum in 30 seconds kind of thing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s drawn in a lot of this scam artistry, you might say.</p>
<p>And I think people living through that,</p>
<p>because there is this natural predilection for people</p>
<p>when they first come into Bitcoin, you&rsquo;re excited about it,</p>
<p>then you get lost in the shit coin universe.</p>
<p>And then just looking at the market success</p>
<p>of Bitcoin versus, and when I use the word shit coin,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just.</p>
<p>You say with all the love in the world.</p>
<p>All the love in the world.</p>
<p>I guess you could call me a toxic maximalist in some ways,</p>
<p>although I consider myself a freedom maximalist,</p>
<p>not a Bitcoin maximalist.</p>
<p>Yeah, I saw that line, that&rsquo;s a good line.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, tracking the market success of Bitcoin</p>
<p>versus alternative crypto assets,</p>
<p>the signal is very clear</p>
<p>that Bitcoin has out competed all of them.</p>
<p>So I think that Bitcoin cultural toxicity has evolved</p>
<p>as an immune response to those bad ideas,</p>
<p>which is actually, if you think about it,</p>
<p>kind of is a tough love, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want new entrance to the space</p>
<p>to get lost in shit coin jungle and learn the hard way,</p>
<p>the way many Bitcoin maximalists have</p>
<p>that the real innovation is Bitcoin.</p>
<p>But like an immune system, I think it can also go too far.</p>
<p>And so I think it&rsquo;s useful when it is defending the space</p>
<p>from false narratives, we might say,</p>
<p>but it becomes detrimental when it&rsquo;s attacking people</p>
<p>that are inquiring about Bitcoin</p>
<p>or people that are approaching Bitcoin</p>
<p>with a good spirit and good intention</p>
<p>and a desire to learn.</p>
<p>Because then at that point,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually impeding the free flow of ideas,</p>
<p>which the example in your clip</p>
<p>that was totally taken out of context.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re literally just saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here to learn and contribute.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve got some stuff to do.</p>
<p>And then people attack that.</p>
<p>Like that doesn&rsquo;t make any fucking sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re attacking someone who&rsquo;s approaching it</p>
<p>in a good spirit and asking questions.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think sometimes talking about it,</p>
<p>the toxicity in the Bitcoin community as an immune response</p>
<p>has a negative effect of giving it a pass</p>
<p>because like it almost says,</p>
<p>look, it equates it with the human immune system,</p>
<p>which seems to do a really good job.</p>
<p>And so you could say that the toxicity has a lot of features</p>
<p>in the sea of fraudulent projects</p>
<p>that steal money from people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really useful to make sure</p>
<p>that you give people the harsh truth</p>
<p>about who is and isn&rsquo;t a scammer.</p>
<p>You have to take it apart,</p>
<p>take it away from that metaphor of the immune system</p>
<p>and look at basic human nature.</p>
<p>And human nature can go to some dark places,</p>
<p>which is it&rsquo;s sad to say that some people,</p>
<p>maybe many of us can enjoy for its own sake, the toxicity,</p>
<p>the mockery, the derision,</p>
<p>and you stop being part of the immune system</p>
<p>that makes a successful idea propagate</p>
<p>and start being a sort of a destructive virus yourself.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something I think about</p>
<p>because I am new to this particular immune system,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve explored other immune systems.</p>
<p>And I think you understand this world much better than me,</p>
<p>but I tend to prefer sort of love</p>
<p>as a mechanism for spreading ideas,</p>
<p>to err on the side of love and kindness</p>
<p>and almost like an open mindedness</p>
<p>in a way where you&rsquo;re constantly lowering yourself</p>
<p>in the face of other ideas, constantly questioning yourself.</p>
<p>But I think I understand that that might be more applicable</p>
<p>in certain contexts,</p>
<p>like maybe in the space of science or something like that.</p>
<p>But in the space of Bitcoin, as it currently stands,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many people that are trying to scam others</p>
<p>out of their money</p>
<p>that the kind of harshness required is different.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I do want to put it on people like yourself</p>
<p>and others who I know you wouldn&rsquo;t consider yourself this,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re one of the faces or leaders in this space</p>
<p>to call people out a little bit,</p>
<p>to inspire them to be more loving, I suppose.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s difficult,</p>
<p>because you want to walk that line carefully.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to be too loving and open minded,</p>
<p>otherwise your brain falls out.</p>
<p>I get it, it&rsquo;s a difficult balance to walk.</p>
<p>It is subtle and it&rsquo;s nuanced and it is difficult to walk.</p>
<p>And I think that, that&rsquo;s why I try to say tough love,</p>
<p>because when we&rsquo;re young, we may have certain ideas</p>
<p>about the way we want our life to go,</p>
<p>but then maybe our parents</p>
<p>are not letting us do certain things.</p>
<p>And we think they&rsquo;re, I know when I was a kid,</p>
<p>I wanted to get my, when I was in fifth grade,</p>
<p>I wanted to get my ear pierced.</p>
<p>My mom wouldn&rsquo;t let me do it.</p>
<p>And I was, oh, come on, mom, I thought it was so cool.</p>
<p>And then two years later, I&rsquo;m like, thank you, mom,</p>
<p>for letting me get my ear pierced.</p>
<p>I think it comes from a place of good intention</p>
<p>that they are actually,</p>
<p>they have asked themselves that question, right?</p>
<p>That they&rsquo;ve been inquiring</p>
<p>in why not this crypto asset or this crypto asset?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve done the exploration,</p>
<p>they keep coming back to Bitcoin</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve seen people being taken advantage of.</p>
<p>But to your point, it&rsquo;s like it can,</p>
<p>this tough love can become detrimental,</p>
<p>just like the immune system can become detrimental, right?</p>
<p>It can overreact and it can actually harm the human body.</p>
<p>So I would say that it&rsquo;s such a tricky and nuanced topic</p>
<p>that even biology hasn&rsquo;t figured it out, right?</p>
<p>A lot of people have autoimmune diseases.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the other thing</p>
<p>that we have this natural, I agree with you about love.</p>
<p>I think love is like the deepest value.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a whole nother philosophical thing,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re biologically programmed to pay more attention</p>
<p>to things that are adversarial or harmful, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of us protecting the meat suit, so to speak.</p>
<p>So there is some maybe better delivery method</p>
<p>by being a little bit toxic to really get the point across,</p>
<p>like, hey, don&rsquo;t get lost over here.</p>
<p>These things can hurt you.</p>
<p>Really try to focus on Bitcoin.</p>
<p>But the toxicity of that message,</p>
<p>I guess it increases its ability</p>
<p>to penetrate the individual, but it can also go too far.</p>
<p>So it is very&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, but I almost to push back a little bit,</p>
<p>toxicity is a funny word.</p>
<p>I think maybe another way to say it is,</p>
<p>I brought up like Christopher Hitchens</p>
<p>and somebody who like, okay,</p>
<p>you might say he&rsquo;s toxic or something like that,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s basically a intellectual powerhouse</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s also a troll.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s constantly, it&rsquo;s like guerrilla warfare</p>
<p>in the space of ideas.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very harsh in his disagreements and criticisms,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s done with incredible grace and skill and poetry.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>We could use more of that.</p>
<p>So toxicity just like&hellip;</p>
<p>These are just words.</p>
<p>They can mean a lot of different things,</p>
<p>but disagreement doesn&rsquo;t have to be done with love,</p>
<p>but it should be done with skill if it&rsquo;s to be effective.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of ways to be effective in guerrilla warfare,</p>
<p>but you wanna learn how to shoot</p>
<p>or whatever the weapon you&rsquo;re using and to do it well.</p>
<p>Some people do it better than others.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s worthwhile to learn to do it well.</p>
<p>Again, I prefer love, but even love,</p>
<p>just because you think you&rsquo;re communicating a good idea,</p>
<p>which you very well may be,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean it also doesn&rsquo;t require skill</p>
<p>to do the communication well,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s disagreement and harsh</p>
<p>or more agreement and loving and so on.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think very fundamentally that all of our decisions,</p>
<p>we alluded to earlier that every decision</p>
<p>is an expression of value, every action we take,</p>
<p>they ultimately come from fear or love.</p>
<p>Fear would be something much more in the biological domain</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re trying to protect ego,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to behave selfishly.</p>
<p>This is the domain of sin.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know all the sins, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath,</p>
<p>lust, pride, envy, these are all selfish behaviors.</p>
<p>Whereas something like love,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s morally superior in that it&rsquo;s more selfless.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that we can properly</p>
<p>define love with words at all,</p>
<p>but I would say maybe like selfless action</p>
<p>could be kind of a generalization of it.</p>
<p>And that way, it is really hard to your point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to love in a world that has a lot of conflict</p>
<p>that might make you fearful</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re really focused on your meat suit.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re focused on the bigger picture</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re focused on others and legacy and life,</p>
<p>that there is a way to do it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I actually think Christ,</p>
<p>that is the highest moral aim, right?</p>
<p>He met all of the vitriol in life,</p>
<p>betrayal, hate, violence,</p>
<p>he met it all with love and he met it with compassion.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why, regardless of if you believe</p>
<p>that he actually lived or any of this,</p>
<p>he is symbolic of the highest moral consciousness possible.</p>
<p>And Carl Jung would say that that was a suitable</p>
<p>alternative to psychoanalysis,</p>
<p>was actually setting your moral aim higher</p>
<p>and striving towards it diligently.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I agree completely.</p>
<p>We need more of that in the Bitcoin space.</p>
<p>We need more of that in the world, frankly.</p>
<p>In the world, yeah.</p>
<p>And these things, they&rsquo;re all intertwined.</p>
<p>We touched on the beginning, all of us get to decide,</p>
<p>but the world does influence what we do.</p>
<p>It does influence kind of if we adopt fear or love,</p>
<p>but it takes, I don&rsquo;t know, it takes good systems</p>
<p>and it takes, I guess, good leaders to set an example.</p>
<p>Yeah, I do believe that there&rsquo;s like individual people</p>
<p>can have a ripple effect.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I try to do, sort of embody the,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just one ant.</p>
<p>But one of the things I have faith in is,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to do that more.</p>
<p>I know this is a podcast,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m trying to do less talking and more doing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been disappointed in myself, if I&rsquo;m being honest,</p>
<p>how much talking I&rsquo;ve been doing,</p>
<p>as opposed to, like in my own private life,</p>
<p>I live the thing I talk about,</p>
<p>but I also haven&rsquo;t created much.</p>
<p>And I believe in the power of individuals that create stuff,</p>
<p>like create an idea through those individuals</p>
<p>that try to create something new, the world progresses.</p>
<p>And hopefully there&rsquo;s more and more,</p>
<p>more and more of those people.</p>
<p>So you mentioned kind of people who,</p>
<p>what the Bitcoin community might call scammers.</p>
<p>I have a lot of passions in my life</p>
<p>that I focus a lot of my attention to.</p>
<p>Bitcoin doesn&rsquo;t happen to be yet one of them.</p>
<p>Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, you know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always looking for things to really fall in love with.</p>
<p>So how is a person like me supposed to figure out,</p>
<p>I also happen to have a platform a little bit,</p>
<p>and how am I supposed to figure out who is interesting,</p>
<p>what is an interesting set of ideas and what are not?</p>
<p>Because people are financially tied into</p>
<p>a lot of the cryptocurrencies that we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>certainly with Bitcoin, you know, their livelihood,</p>
<p>their wellbeing is tied up to it.</p>
<p>So it becomes much more emotional, much more personal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no longer purely an exploration of ideas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really almost like a threat on your property.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a personal threat</p>
<p>and it makes it very difficult to explore those ideas.</p>
<p>So I understand that, but it makes it very difficult</p>
<p>for somebody like me to just walk in and be curious.</p>
<p>So how do I proceed in this difficult world</p>
<p>in exploring this landscape</p>
<p>and not give a platform to ideas that may harm others?</p>
<p>I guess first I&rsquo;d like to commend your forthrightness</p>
<p>about this, because I don&rsquo;t think many people</p>
<p>try to walk that line necessarily.</p>
<p>People, again, kind of the territorial imperative,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll put whoever on, they&rsquo;ll help expand their reach.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Or say whatever needs to be said to expand their reach.</p>
<p>So I think you&rsquo;re coming from a good place.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great piece written</p>
<p>on the topic of scammers and scamming.</p>
<p>I think it was by Goldstein.</p>
<p>He wrote a piece called, Everyone&rsquo;s a Scammer.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sort of back to this general human proclivity</p>
<p>to try and get something for nothing always,</p>
<p>which again, it can be positive,</p>
<p>it can be innovative, or it can be a negative.</p>
<p>You can be trying to steal from people.</p>
<p>That might be, I think that&rsquo;s a useful piece</p>
<p>just to kind of see the crypto world through that lens.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how Bitcoiners are thinking all the time.</p>
<p>They are by nature adversarial thinkers.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re trying to minimize the need for trust</p>
<p>in any situation and maximize verification.</p>
<p>As far as sifting through the ideas,</p>
<p>I guess this is back where the cultural immune system</p>
<p>has some utility.</p>
<p>Because there were times when I thought</p>
<p>this particular crypto asset,</p>
<p>Augur was one I was really into,</p>
<p>that it could facilitate prediction markets</p>
<p>and prediction markets could make markets more efficient,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>But when that investment does get to the point</p>
<p>when that investment thesis basically met</p>
<p>the cultural filter or immune system,</p>
<p>it forced me to reevaluate my position,</p>
<p>forced me to really look into it more deeply.</p>
<p>And through that exploration,</p>
<p>I realized that it would need to be built on Bitcoin</p>
<p>to work basically.</p>
<p>So it really comes down to like you doing your homework,</p>
<p>but we can&rsquo;t all deeply evaluate every idea out there.</p>
<p>One of the things I struggle with was Alex Jones,</p>
<p>for example, had dinner with him.</p>
<p>I could tell that will be a very fun conversation,</p>
<p>but like then I also understand that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like consequences to that conversation</p>
<p>that should be explored with care.</p>
<p>And so you need to take on the responsibility</p>
<p>of being a chef with the puffer fish</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>That said, just like you said,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult to know this ahead of time</p>
<p>and I will probably make mistakes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a shitty thing to have to live with</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m going to make mistakes</p>
<p>and some of them very large.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, I mean, I can imagine a bunch of different ways,</p>
<p>but all we can do in this world</p>
<p>is once we make the mistakes,</p>
<p>we acknowledge those mistakes and learn.</p>
<p>And also, I have to put this on the rest of us</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t take one thing that a person did</p>
<p>and then burn them at the stake for it.</p>
<p>That you realize that we all make mistakes,</p>
<p>that a particular mistake does not make the person.</p>
<p>And this applies to taking stuff out of context</p>
<p>over hundreds of hours of talking,</p>
<p>but it applies to actual, in context, big mistake.</p>
<p>So what if I murdered somebody at some point?</p>
<p>Just give me a break.</p>
<p>No, there are some things that are too far, of course,</p>
<p>but in general, we need to give each other a chance.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I&rsquo;m still,</p>
<p>I walk with a heavy heart</p>
<p>knowing that I&rsquo;ll probably make a mistake,</p>
<p>especially one that I didn&rsquo;t mean to.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one that worries me most.</p>
<p>This is human nature, like hamartia, to miss the mark.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the root word of sin.</p>
<p>We are sinful by nature.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t help it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way, again, pain is information, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way to learn other than trying, failing,</p>
<p>learning, and then you put yourself in better formation,</p>
<p>right, in formation to better deal with it next time.</p>
<p>So I hope, I don&rsquo;t get the sense</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re actually afraid of making a misstep.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re just maybe disappointed&rsquo;s a better word.</p>
<p>You know you&rsquo;re gonna make the mistakes.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s exactly, that&rsquo;s a much, much better word.</p>
<p>But we have to embrace that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only way anything,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only way we can advance,</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;re dealing with an incomprehensible reality.</p>
<p>All we can do is throw spaghetti at the wall</p>
<p>and see what sticks.</p>
<p>And in that process, we&rsquo;re all inherently gonna hurt</p>
<p>ourselves and hurt others,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where love and forgiveness come into play, right?</p>
<p>And yeah, I think the other thing is that this culture</p>
<p>of reducing people down to a label, right,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s racism or whether you&rsquo;re calling them a scammer</p>
<p>or any number of terms,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re discounting their sovereignty to zero, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re taking a super complex human that is vast,</p>
<p>contains multitudes, is changing over time,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to put them in a bucket of a word.</p>
<p>And that is just, I think, a cognitive fallacy.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s not only gonna hurt the person</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re winnowing down to a word,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also gonna hurt you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s gonna, in your attempt to decomplexify reality</p>
<p>by assigning this person to a term,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually gonna create bad outcomes for yourself.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re not gonna understand that person.</p>
<p>I do also think there&rsquo;s a failure</p>
<p>of our social media technology that incentivizes</p>
<p>that kind of reduction to a label.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the viral nature of that reduction.</p>
<p>So not only do we humans naturally do that,</p>
<p>our social media platforms make that easier, more fun,</p>
<p>more effective to do that at scale, the mass hysteria.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s actually technological ways</p>
<p>of adding friction to that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wonder, I mean, I agree with you that it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>social media is an amplifier to our natural,</p>
<p>this natural way of dealing with one another.</p>
<p>But I wonder, and my thinking has evolved a lot on this,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something below</p>
<p>the way we&rsquo;re treating each other too, right?</p>
<p>We could say civilization sort of advances</p>
<p>in the tools we make and the way we treat each other.</p>
<p>We tend to have better tools, better quality of life,</p>
<p>and better morality, better quality of living,</p>
<p>and ways of dealing with one another.</p>
<p>And I think that when you corrupt the money,</p>
<p>that it really does push us the negative direction,</p>
<p>pushes us away from, again, encouraging,</p>
<p>or magnifying scarcity artificially</p>
<p>causes us to be more divisive.</p>
<p>When things are more divisive,</p>
<p>we tend to be less civilized, less nuanced,</p>
<p>more black or white, or this or that,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re this, or you&rsquo;re label A or label B.</p>
<p>So I really think, and this is a harder one to unravel,</p>
<p>but I think if we can fix the money, right,</p>
<p>which again is the base layer operating system</p>
<p>for human moral action in the world,</p>
<p>that it has downstream effects.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;d actually maybe start to treat each other</p>
<p>a little better on social media,</p>
<p>despite the fact that it enables this faster communication.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting, so perhaps fixing social media</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;ve been thinking about is treating the symptom,</p>
<p>not the cause.</p>
<p>Yeah, that is the Bitcoin rabbit hole in a nutshell,</p>
<p>is that they say fix the money, fix the world.</p>
<p>You keep tracing these different social malaises</p>
<p>or technological difficulties, lack of innovation.</p>
<p>Weinstein&rsquo;s entire Portal podcast,</p>
<p>something went wrong in the early 70s.</p>
<p>We went off the gold standard in 1971,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a great website, wtfhappat1971.com,</p>
<p>goes through this whole gamut of socioeconomic data</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s completely gone askew since the early 70s.</p>
<p>Yeah, you had this whole video,</p>
<p>what do you think about Eric Weinstein and Bitcoin</p>
<p>and the gold standard?</p>
<p>Does he, I actually haven&rsquo;t heard him talk about his thesis</p>
<p>about the 70s in connection to the,</p>
<p>going off of the gold standard.</p>
<p>Yeah, what are your thoughts there?</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about his general relationship</p>
<p>with the Bitcoin idea and the community?</p>
<p>Yeah, the first exposure I had to Eric was his,</p>
<p>I think it was his first episode with Peter Thiel,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going through that thesis</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s been this general institutional rot</p>
<p>and suppression of innovation since the early 70s,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s trying to identify what it is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they ever pended on the money</p>
<p>on going off the gold standard,</p>
<p>but in recent interactions with Eric,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve interacted with him on Clubhouse.</p>
<p>We recently released an episode of the show</p>
<p>I did with Chris Espley,</p>
<p>and it was titled Dear Eric Weinstein.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going through his worldview</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s expressed in the portal</p>
<p>and tying it back to the money in different ways.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s been, he&rsquo;s engaged.</p>
<p>Eric retweeted the show.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve exchanged some messages.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been very open minded.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s asked some really good questions.</p>
<p>So I get the sense that he&rsquo;s approaching</p>
<p>this very wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>He does bring with him his existing worldview</p>
<p>and his existing theory.</p>
<p>The one that really blew up was gauge theory.</p>
<p>They got really popular.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know a lot about gauge theory.</p>
<p>I actually messaged Eric and said,</p>
<p>I want to learn more genuinely,</p>
<p>because he seems to be serious</p>
<p>that that needs to be considered in the sphere of money.</p>
<p>And so I want to learn more about it.</p>
<p>But I think overall it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great to see an intellectual heavyweight</p>
<p>of his caliber gravitating towards Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Yeah, he has some gauge theoretic conceptions</p>
<p>about the world broadly, but also about economics,</p>
<p>which ultimately boils down to just a set of mathematics,</p>
<p>which allows you to more effectively reason about the world.</p>
<p>And he has a certain set of views there.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s fascinating to see him grapple with it.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s also kind of actually kind of like all of us,</p>
<p>grappling with the idea of what is Bitcoin in this world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very young technology,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s unclear exactly how the ideas of the past</p>
<p>fit with it and integrate, how the two integrate together.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s interesting to explore,</p>
<p>not just Bitcoin in the particular.</p>
<p>So for me, like what I&rsquo;ve always saw Bitcoin as</p>
<p>from the beginning, from a narrow worldview</p>
<p>is computer science, which is where I come from.</p>
<p>And so I wasn&rsquo;t almost aware</p>
<p>in the social, political, financial aspects of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>But now I see that there&rsquo;s not just power,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s fascinating ideas to explore on that side</p>
<p>of things, not just the computer science,</p>
<p>not just the technical details,</p>
<p>but the political, the socioeconomic, the philosophical.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I find all the fascination in the world,</p>
<p>frankly.</p>
<p>One other thing about Weinstein and intellectuals</p>
<p>more generally that are skeptical of Bitcoin,</p>
<p>I would challenge them to read the book,</p>
<p>Human Action, written by Mises.</p>
<p>I think in 1949, he published the English version.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s essentially the Bible of Austrian economics.</p>
<p>And I think Austrian economics is a noticeable gap</p>
<p>in most modern intellectuals worldviews,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not taught in school.</p>
<p>I mean, I have a master&rsquo;s degree in accounting and finance,</p>
<p>studied a lot of economics in school.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not one peep of Austrian econ.</p>
<p>The least we&rsquo;d love talking about all the degrees he has.</p>
<p>I was a CPA.</p>
<p>But that curriculum that we get in college</p>
<p>is noticeably deficient in Austrian economics.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a reason why, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s heavily government influenced.</p>
<p>Again, master&rsquo;s degree in accounting,</p>
<p>they never taught me about what money is</p>
<p>or where money comes from.</p>
<p>All you learn is that the central bank issues money</p>
<p>and the central bank takes money away.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s conceived of in the textbooks</p>
<p>quite literally as God, right?</p>
<p>An entity that suffers no opportunity costs,</p>
<p>that basically is the foundation</p>
<p>of the entire Keynesian worldview</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re taught in economics.</p>
<p>And Austrian economics is the opposite</p>
<p>end of the spectrum of that, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually the culmination,</p>
<p>which economics is the youngest science in the world,</p>
<p>by the way.</p>
<p>So it is kind of the front,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the frontiers of science in many ways,</p>
<p>like to actually, when I say praxeology,</p>
<p>many people have never even heard of that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s something, it&rsquo;s an a priori study</p>
<p>equivalent to something like mathematics,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re building things from first principles</p>
<p>to reason about economic reality.</p>
<p>And I think that book, it&rsquo;s a very difficult book</p>
<p>written by Mises, 1200 pages, translated from German.</p>
<p>The way he wields English is fascinating</p>
<p>and terrifying all at the same time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d probably take you six months to read it</p>
<p>if you read it daily, seriously.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a beast of a book.</p>
<p>But that will plug the gap, I think in most,</p>
<p>any intellectual that&rsquo;s skeptical about Bitcoin,</p>
<p>I think that will plug the gap that&rsquo;s necessary</p>
<p>for you to see it in a new light.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll take that as a challenge.</p>
<p>Now that we took a little bit of a break,</p>
<p>ate some good Texas brisket, thank you for that,</p>
<p>by the way, for passing over.</p>
<p>Quite welcome.</p>
<p>Let me ask the ridiculous question.</p>
<p>At the core of the idea of Bitcoin,</p>
<p>is this guy or this entity named Satoshi Nakamoto?</p>
<p>So the ridiculous question is, who is Satoshi Nakamoto?</p>
<p>And first of all, is it you?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not me.</p>
<p>I wish.</p>
<p>And is this an interesting question?</p>
<p>Or is it just something about our human nature</p>
<p>that wants to, that always tends towards mystery?</p>
<p>Well, as we&rsquo;ve touched on a bit today,</p>
<p>you know, mythology, in my opinion,</p>
<p>is something that is intrinsic to how we see the world</p>
<p>in a lot of ways.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s how, it&rsquo;s kind of the structure</p>
<p>by which we build these useful fictions.</p>
<p>And so in that way, you could just say that</p>
<p>Satoshi is the godhead of Bitcoin, effectively.</p>
<p>And I think a compelling argument could be made</p>
<p>that his disappearance is what really solidifies</p>
<p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s decentralization.</p>
<p>Because if there were one individual to personally vilify</p>
<p>or denigrate or attack, you know, to disparage</p>
<p>or question the motives of, you know,</p>
<p>if he&rsquo;s out on the Hollywood Hills partying,</p>
<p>everyone knows he&rsquo;s got a million Bitcoin, you know,</p>
<p>it would just kind of tarnish the entire project</p>
<p>in a lot of ways.</p>
<p>But the fact that on that theme, something for nothing,</p>
<p>this guy actually gave humanity something for nothing.</p>
<p>And it appears that he didn&rsquo;t profit in any way.</p>
<p>He, she, or they.</p>
<p>I actually heard recently that he identified as a he</p>
<p>in some of his communications.</p>
<p>So it sounds like it is a he.</p>
<p>So like his communication is being like studied,</p>
<p>like almost like exactly as if he is a religious.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Like a prophet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating to imagine that he&rsquo;s still alive</p>
<p>and living in this world.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s even more fascinating to imagine</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s perhaps participating in the Bitcoin community</p>
<p>because I mean, that takes a special human being</p>
<p>to out of principle do that, to do, to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very much the George Washington.</p>
<p>Yeah, I always wonder like how many people are like that?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a cliche that like absolute power corrupts,</p>
<p>absolutely, like power corrupts.</p>
<p>But it seems like the progress of humanity depends</p>
<p>on the people whom power doesn&rsquo;t corrupt.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s enough to have just a small selection of those.</p>
<p>And even if most of us are too weak, we give into power.</p>
<p>If given the chance, all it takes is a few.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;ve never thought of it like that,</p>
<p>but Marcus Aurelius immediately came to mind.</p>
<p>You know, the guy that he had the keys to the kingdom</p>
<p>and he apparently adhered to the stoic virtues</p>
<p>until the end, but yeah, I agree with Satoshi.</p>
<p>The other thing that&rsquo;s interesting is he would be by far</p>
<p>the most wealthy person in the world on a liquid asset basis</p>
<p>because he has a million Bitcoin,</p>
<p>which is 60 billion liquid net worth at current prices.</p>
<p>So if he is still alive and just operating in the world,</p>
<p>he is daily and moment to moment resisting massive</p>
<p>incentives to go and just be the richest guy in the world.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the ultimate hodler.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, so it&rsquo;s, I mean, it&rsquo;s turning down</p>
<p>not just financial success, but also fame.</p>
<p>I mean, fame is another drug.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of power, but it&rsquo;s in itself is also a drug,</p>
<p>especially in this modern society, in this attention.</p>
<p>And he would have both.</p>
<p>He would have both.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun to imagine who it could be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating if it&rsquo;s somebody like you</p>
<p>or somebody like Elon or somebody like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating to think about.</p>
<p>I think Elon would be hilarious if he came out</p>
<p>and he was Satoshi and be like,</p>
<p>hey guys, I know I&rsquo;m already the richest guy in the world,</p>
<p>but I gotta go ahead and double my lead here.</p>
<p>What do you make of Elon Musk investing with Tesla,</p>
<p>investing in Bitcoin and maybe broaden it out</p>
<p>in some of these other, you know,</p>
<p>big billionaires, but also people tied to major companies</p>
<p>investing in Bitcoin?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think Michael Saylor really led the charge on that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the CEO of MicroStrategy</p>
<p>that I think they&rsquo;ve acquired upwards</p>
<p>of $2 billion in Bitcoin now.</p>
<p>Started acquiring August, maybe of 2020.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s, you know, personally bought a lot of it.</p>
<p>He bought a lot as a treasury reserve asset</p>
<p>for his company, MicroStrategy.</p>
<p>Then they leveraged up on a convertible note</p>
<p>and bought more.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s really gone, really leading the charge</p>
<p>in this Bitcoin institutional adoption.</p>
<p>Your conversation with him is a really interesting one.</p>
<p>Your series of, I mean, series of episodes I suppose,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s only a couple of conversations, I guess.</p>
<p>Yeah, we recorded twice, five and a half hours each.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s about 11 hours of content.</p>
<p>Yeah, thank you.</p>
<p>A lot of people have said that it&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>first principle thing they&rsquo;ve ever seen on Bitcoin,</p>
<p>which I take no credit for that at all.</p>
<p>I mean, I just sat down with a guy and unleashed him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just a beast.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s fascinating that his longterm vision with it.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m all philosophically bought in,</p>
<p>but if he&rsquo;s right, if this set of ideas are as powerful</p>
<p>as he describes, as you described,</p>
<p>that this would change the world,</p>
<p>which as you say, it&rsquo;s funny that a company</p>
<p>like MicroStrategy might be the company</p>
<p>that has the biggest macro effect</p>
<p>on our economy and our world.</p>
<p>Yeah, the conversation reshaped my worldview a lot too,</p>
<p>because he framed money as energy,</p>
<p>which I had often thought of money as time.</p>
<p>And it explored those connections a lot in my writing,</p>
<p>but looking at it as energy, and then his supposition</p>
<p>that the purpose of life is to basically channel energy</p>
<p>across space and time.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re just trying to figure out how to channel</p>
<p>more energy across space and time</p>
<p>toward the satisfaction of aims.</p>
<p>And his definition, or his answer to that question,</p>
<p>what is money, is that money is the highest form of energy</p>
<p>a human being can channel.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a claim to all other forms of energy</p>
<p>we can manifest in the world.</p>
<p>And that just completely reshaped how I see it,</p>
<p>brought in this whole other side</p>
<p>to my intellectual explorations of money.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate on that a little bit?</p>
<p>So I understand money is time,</p>
<p>which in itself is a really powerful idea.</p>
<p>But money is energy, and channeling energy,</p>
<p>can you break that apart?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I guess I definitely have to check out</p>
<p>the whole series to really get his perspective,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll do my best to condense it.</p>
<p>Life itself, all forms of life are,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re dependent on energy, right?</p>
<p>Energy fuels everything, fuels life in action and motion</p>
<p>and all of that.</p>
<p>And we could say that maybe like a plant</p>
<p>is harnessing solar energy</p>
<p>and then reallocating that into growth.</p>
<p>So its aim is to grow towards the sun, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s allocating energy towards its goal</p>
<p>of harnessing more solar energy kind of thing.</p>
<p>So, and humans too have evolved</p>
<p>to figure out how to harness energy in different ways</p>
<p>to satisfy higher and more complicated aims.</p>
<p>So the original energy network</p>
<p>that he referenced was fire, right?</p>
<p>We actually learned to wield fire as a tool in and of itself.</p>
<p>So not only are we learning to channel energy,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re actually learning how to isolate energy</p>
<p>as a tool in and of itself.</p>
<p>And so we went into that,</p>
<p>how harnessing fire had changed human beings.</p>
<p>And actually, this is one of the earliest examples too</p>
<p>of a coevolution between tool and our biology,</p>
<p>because when we developed fire, we developed cooking.</p>
<p>And cooking is, you can kind of think of it</p>
<p>as pre digestion in a way.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re liberating these macronutrients</p>
<p>or making things that otherwise</p>
<p>would not be digestible, edible.</p>
<p>And it increases the efficiency</p>
<p>by which we extract nutrients from food.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what cooking does.</p>
<p>So when we figured out cooking,</p>
<p>we liberated all these digestive resources</p>
<p>that were reallocated towards higher cognitive development.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this evolutionary path</p>
<p>between figuring out fire and us becoming smarter,</p>
<p>which is interesting.</p>
<p>Some other early examples he gave,</p>
<p>he went into were missiles and hydraulics.</p>
<p>So missiles being, we learned to hunt at a distance.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t bring down a wooly mammoth,</p>
<p>maybe with spears and up close and personal force,</p>
<p>but we could with spears and javelins and slings and whatnot.</p>
<p>And then he went into how we&rsquo;ve used water</p>
<p>to channel hydraulic energy.</p>
<p>So we can basically overcome gravity.</p>
<p>We can move, there&rsquo;s theories that the pyramids</p>
<p>were constructed using, the blocks were moved</p>
<p>using hydraulic energy or using water.</p>
<p>Clearly we use like cargo ships and whatnot</p>
<p>to move things much more efficiently across water</p>
<p>than we could the land.</p>
<p>So his whole view is how we keep figuring out better ways</p>
<p>and more efficient ways to harness energy and channel it.</p>
<p>And in that perspective, money has always represented</p>
<p>a claim on all other forms of energy.</p>
<p>So whatever energy couldn&rsquo;t be channeled</p>
<p>towards something useful in the economy historically</p>
<p>would go into gold mining.</p>
<p>So gold became this residual, this economic,</p>
<p>this token of the excess energy created</p>
<p>by the market economy.</p>
<p>And then you could take that token of energy</p>
<p>and use it to redeem for any other form of energy</p>
<p>or any of the products of energy itself.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, I guess it&rsquo;s my best approximation of it.</p>
<p>And it just really shattered my worldview again,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;d always thought about it as time.</p>
<p>Like we spend time sacrificing to obtain money</p>
<p>that we then redeem for commencement sacrifices</p>
<p>from others, but I&rsquo;d never considered it purely as energy.</p>
<p>And then it also ties back into gold,</p>
<p>where there was an energy expenditure necessary</p>
<p>to obtain gold.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a proof of work associated with obtaining gold</p>
<p>that protected its market value, right?</p>
<p>So you had to expend, again,</p>
<p>if market value of gold&rsquo;s 2000 an ounce,</p>
<p>you had to expend 1900 an ounce mining.</p>
<p>So it kept producers honest in a way.</p>
<p>So do you think something like proof of stake</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more about reputation</p>
<p>than actual exertion, like energy can work?</p>
<p>No, I think proof of stake is inherently centralizing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the old Matthew principle,</p>
<p>from those who have to those who have,</p>
<p>more will be given from those who have not,</p>
<p>everything will be taken.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what proof of stake is.</p>
<p>You need proof of work to embody skin in the game</p>
<p>in the marketplace, such that contributions</p>
<p>are commensurate with consideration received.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how systems work.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the idea why proof of work might</p>
<p>incentivize decentralization?</p>
<p>Do you worry that as Bitcoin becomes more powerful,</p>
<p>it may become, again, more centralized?</p>
<p>Well, the decentralization of Bitcoin</p>
<p>is largely driven by the nodes, actually,</p>
<p>which aren&rsquo;t actually mining.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just choosing which rule set to implement.</p>
<p>And then the mining network&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually enforcing that rule set.</p>
<p>So I think the mining network</p>
<p>is inherently decentralized in that,</p>
<p>really anyone with access to cheap energy</p>
<p>can become a miner.</p>
<p>You can freely enter or exit the market</p>
<p>or the network at any time.</p>
<p>But maintaining the block size at a manageable level</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s key to maintaining node decentralization.</p>
<p>This is an interesting question.</p>
<p>Who do you think has more power, the miners or the nodes?</p>
<p>Because the nodes carry the idea of the protocol,</p>
<p>like the specifics.</p>
<p>So in some sense, they have more power,</p>
<p>if Bitcoin is an idea.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re kind of mutually indispensable though,</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no security without the miners.</p>
<p>So without the miners, Bitcoin is just an idea.</p>
<p>And the idea of Bitcoin has maybe existed</p>
<p>even before Bitcoin, right?</p>
<p>Just sound money.</p>
<p>We just say sound money as an idea.</p>
<p>But there was no way to root that into thermodynamic reality</p>
<p>without Satoshi figuring out, not just proof of work,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the entire composite of the difficulty adjustment,</p>
<p>proof of work, one way hashing, et cetera.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s hard to say,</p>
<p>hard to disentangle the two.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked about money as morality too.</p>
<p>How do you think about moral and immoral action</p>
<p>in the context of money?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this great quote by Rothbard,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a famous Austrian economist.</p>
<p>And he says, quote, to be moral, an act must be free,</p>
<p>unquote.</p>
<p>And I think morality, it changes over time</p>
<p>and it is, it has its roots</p>
<p>in biology.</p>
<p>Jordan Peterson makes the point that even animals</p>
<p>have their own sort of pseudo morality.</p>
<p>Where like with wolf packs, for instance,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a dispute between the alpha males,</p>
<p>or I guess between an alpha male and a incumbent,</p>
<p>the two males will have a fight basically.</p>
<p>And then when one, it&rsquo;s decided that one has won,</p>
<p>the loser will basically roll over and give up his neck</p>
<p>to the alpha male.</p>
<p>And they do this instead of fighting to the death</p>
<p>because in a wolf pack, they need every wolf</p>
<p>so they can go out and bring down,</p>
<p>you never know when you&rsquo;re gonna need the 20th wolf</p>
<p>to bring down the big buffalo the next day or whatever.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve developed this less than fight to the death</p>
<p>social morality to optimize their effectiveness</p>
<p>as a wolf pack.</p>
<p>And similarly for humans, like our morality</p>
<p>sort of emerges through competition and play even.</p>
<p>There are these implicit rules that come into place</p>
<p>based on how we&rsquo;re organizing ourselves over time.</p>
<p>And with, so with money it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>because most tools we would consider to be amoral,</p>
<p>as in a hammer can be used to build a house</p>
<p>which could be seen to be good,</p>
<p>like a good constructive purpose,</p>
<p>or it could be used to bash them on skull,</p>
<p>which could be something evil.</p>
<p>And that the tool itself is amoral,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have any independent morality of its own.</p>
<p>All of the morality is associated</p>
<p>with the wielder of the tool.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the quote like, any tool can be a weapon</p>
<p>if you hold it right sort of thing.</p>
<p>But money&rsquo;s maybe a little bit different in that</p>
<p>when you monopolize money,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only useful as a tool for one thing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s for allocating wealth away from some</p>
<p>and to others.</p>
<p>So it is the only utility of monopolized money is theft.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no other, there&rsquo;s a lot of propaganda out there</p>
<p>that will say, oh, we need to print money</p>
<p>to get out of this disaster or to give to the poor,</p>
<p>whatever moralistically camouflaged political aim</p>
<p>is being discussed, the base layer of monopolized money</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s only useful for taking from some</p>
<p>and giving to others.</p>
<p>So another way to think about this is that money</p>
<p>is a paper claim on the savings of society.</p>
<p>So it is just a ticket for redeeming savings,</p>
<p>which could be time, could be capital,</p>
<p>it could be knowledge from any market actor in the world.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of a list of who owns what,</p>
<p>if you will, it&rsquo;s a proxy list.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s one group that can amend that list</p>
<p>and others cannot, then they&rsquo;re basically able</p>
<p>and incented to modify that list to their own benefit.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s effectively what a central bank is doing.</p>
<p>So a central bank is determining how much money to create.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re also determining who gets to receive</p>
<p>that money first and the first recipients of that money</p>
<p>are gonna be the beneficiaries in an inflationary regime.</p>
<p>So those that receive the money last</p>
<p>are the ones being robbed.</p>
<p>Those that receive the money first are the ones</p>
<p>that are receiving the stolen proceeds, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>And this has a really corrosive effect on social morality</p>
<p>because if we consider that people&rsquo;s time horizon,</p>
<p>which the Austrians call the time preference,</p>
<p>the more short term thinking you are,</p>
<p>the more likely you are to engage in selfish behavior.</p>
<p>If you know that it&rsquo;s all over tomorrow</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve been working your whole life</p>
<p>to develop this business or create this reputation</p>
<p>or whatever your thing is,</p>
<p>but you just are given the foreknowledge that tomorrow</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all gonna end, you&rsquo;re much more likely to go out</p>
<p>and just maybe get drunk and party that night</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no more repercussions.</p>
<p>Whereas if you know that you&rsquo;re gonna live</p>
<p>for a very long time, you&rsquo;re much more likely</p>
<p>to plan for the future.</p>
<p>So we just say that your time horizon</p>
<p>is closely related to your morality.</p>
<p>The longer term thinking you are, the more moral</p>
<p>you would tend to behave, the more you would care</p>
<p>about long term relationship building</p>
<p>versus going out and getting wasted.</p>
<p>And money too impinges very closely on our time preference.</p>
<p>And again, time preference is the Austrian term.</p>
<p>So low time preference means you&rsquo;re long term oriented,</p>
<p>high time preference means you&rsquo;re short term oriented,</p>
<p>which can be a little trippy for some people</p>
<p>because it sounds backwards.</p>
<p>But if your money constantly loses value,</p>
<p>you are incentivized to become more short term oriented.</p>
<p>You are handicapped in your ability to plan for the future</p>
<p>because your money, which is intended to be,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s another definition of money,</p>
<p>as an insurance policy against uncertainty.</p>
<p>So no matter what problems you encounter in the world,</p>
<p>this money will best help you deal with those problems.</p>
<p>When that insurance policy against uncertainty</p>
<p>is injected with uncertainty, it&rsquo;s polluted</p>
<p>with the uncertainty of inflation,</p>
<p>your time horizon shrinks,</p>
<p>your ability to plan long term shrinks.</p>
<p>And this impinges on social morality.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a great book on this called Honest Money</p>
<p>by Gary North.</p>
<p>And in that book, he gives the parable of the wine maker.</p>
<p>And the wine maker, if we just imagine</p>
<p>the hypothetical wine maker,</p>
<p>operating a business in a centrally banked economy.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s say his central bank just doubled</p>
<p>the money supply to quote unquote save the economy.</p>
<p>Say an increase in money supply from one to $2 trillion.</p>
<p>This wine maker that&rsquo;s accustomed to selling wine</p>
<p>at $20 a bottle is now faced with basically three choices.</p>
<p>And an important point here too,</p>
<p>before we get into his three choices,</p>
<p>are what prices are themselves.</p>
<p>Prices are the most visible aspect of any service.</p>
<p>So when you increase prices,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re incentivizing your customers to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna look at your competition.</p>
<p>When you decrease prices,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re incentivizing market actors</p>
<p>to look closer at your product, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re delivering a solution at a lower price.</p>
<p>So this wine maker that&rsquo;s accustomed to selling his wine</p>
<p>at a $20 price point, all of a sudden,</p>
<p>because of a central bank has tripled the money supply,</p>
<p>he has three choices.</p>
<p>He can either keep selling his bottle at $20</p>
<p>and all of his inputs will increase due to inflation by 50%.</p>
<p>So he will lose 50% of his profit margin as a result.</p>
<p>So he can choose to eat that loss.</p>
<p>He can choose to double the selling price</p>
<p>of his bottle of wine from $20 to $40,</p>
<p>because all of the price of his inputs doubled.</p>
<p>So then he would maintain his profit margin.</p>
<p>Or the third one is that he could choose</p>
<p>to water down his wine or use inferior ingredients.</p>
<p>So he could use cheaper inputs</p>
<p>and maintain the output at the same price.</p>
<p>So he could basically start selling his customers</p>
<p>an inferior product for the same price</p>
<p>to preserve his profit margin.</p>
<p>Now, again, case number one, it&rsquo;s not very palatable.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t wanna eat the economic loss.</p>
<p>Case number two, he doesn&rsquo;t wanna eat the profit margin.</p>
<p>Case number two, it&rsquo;s not very good either,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s then incentivizing all of his customers</p>
<p>to go shop other winemakers if he doubles his price.</p>
<p>So human nature being what it is,</p>
<p>trying to get something for nothing,</p>
<p>inflation actually seeps into other industries</p>
<p>by encouraging producers into option three,</p>
<p>which is to deceive your customer in the short run.</p>
<p>And again, this would be done initially at the margins.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just a few drops of water.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just some cheaper grapes.</p>
<p>But over time, this inflation is actually inducing producers</p>
<p>to weigh their financial wellbeing</p>
<p>against their moral integrity.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s forcing them into this dilemma</p>
<p>that would not exist in a free market economy.</p>
<p>And as they charge more money for wine that is inferior,</p>
<p>the buyers of that wine,</p>
<p>also living in a central banked economy</p>
<p>are also getting scammed by not only the inflation,</p>
<p>but also the wine.</p>
<p>So it becomes this kind of corrosive contagious moral effect</p>
<p>that propagates throughout an economy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve argued in a lot of my writing</p>
<p>that inflation is this infectious moral cancer on the world.</p>
<p>I think it is tied back to a lot of the social strangeness</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen in modern times,</p>
<p>where there seems to be a lot of fake people</p>
<p>and a lot of fake businesses and a lot of scams,</p>
<p>all of these things.</p>
<p>I think it really is rooted in the money.</p>
<p>And Bitcoin, as the first money in history</p>
<p>that has a 0% terminal inflation rate,</p>
<p>or said differently, zero unexpected inflation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no theft integrated into Bitcoin.</p>
<p>You can only earn it through work</p>
<p>or sacrificing resources to obtain it.</p>
<p>It is the antidote to this moral cancer</p>
<p>that inflation riddles our society with.</p>
<p>Again, you&rsquo;re blowing my mind a little bit</p>
<p>to think about the ripple effects of inflation,</p>
<p>the way it seeps through our interactions.</p>
<p>So at the very, the early ripples</p>
<p>is the effect it has on the products,</p>
<p>on the dilution of the wine.</p>
<p>But also it might have ripple effects on the character,</p>
<p>on the behavior of people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting, artificial creation of scarcity,</p>
<p>creating, having effects on society at the social,</p>
<p>like the social fabric.</p>
<p>And I guess you&rsquo;re arguing the morality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s perverting free market dynamics,</p>
<p>which again, we said free markets generate pragmatic truth.</p>
<p>So inflation distorts price signals,</p>
<p>which means it confuses capital allocation.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re trying to solve problems,</p>
<p>but all of a sudden we can&rsquo;t tell</p>
<p>if this price increase is a matter</p>
<p>of true supply and demand change</p>
<p>or a matter of policy change.</p>
<p>So it clouds our economic perceptions.</p>
<p>It suppresses innovation</p>
<p>because now you&rsquo;ve exacerbated</p>
<p>the boom and bust business cycle.</p>
<p>People are gonna overborrow and go into projects</p>
<p>that they can&rsquo;t profitably sustain.</p>
<p>So then there&rsquo;ll be a huge collapse.</p>
<p>So that actually breaks the market&rsquo;s function</p>
<p>of generating innovation.</p>
<p>And then, yeah, I would argue too</p>
<p>that it pollutes our pursuit of virtue, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s pushing back, but I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as clear to me,</p>
<p>perhaps because I haven&rsquo;t thought about it deeply,</p>
<p>that money is core to life and human interaction</p>
<p>because there might be other forces,</p>
<p>other fraudulent forces, other things in human nature</p>
<p>that are creating these effects as well.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s clear, I think you&rsquo;re articulating really well</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s these negative effects from inflation.</p>
<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s other undiscovered,</p>
<p>not undiscovered, but ones we&rsquo;re not making explicit now,</p>
<p>forces that are creating all the things we&rsquo;re seeing now</p>
<p>with, like you said, cancer culture and all those things,</p>
<p>but also the negative effects on the quality of products,</p>
<p>on the excellence of the creativity and the innovation,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s other factors.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of, listen, it&rsquo;s compelling to think money&rsquo;s</p>
<p>at the core of it all.</p>
<p>Like if you fix, I forgot what the phrase was.</p>
<p>Fix the money, fix the world.</p>
<p>Yeah, fix the money, fix the world.</p>
<p>Again, things that sound good, I&rsquo;m skeptical of by nature.</p>
<p>So I wonder if there&rsquo;s other things that are beyond money</p>
<p>that are somehow deeply integrated into our human nature.</p>
<p>Another one related to money is social cohesion itself.</p>
<p>So very simple anecdote for this was the more you increase</p>
<p>the inflation rate, social cohesion is inversely</p>
<p>proportionate to that.</p>
<p>So the extreme example would be hyperinflation, right?</p>
<p>Where the money is produced in such excess</p>
<p>that it loses all meaning and relevance.</p>
<p>So today in Venezuela, there is cash clogging the gutters,</p>
<p>clogging the streets, clogging the sewer system,</p>
<p>because the cash has lost all relevance.</p>
<p>And so anecdotally, we would suspect that,</p>
<p>okay, if there&rsquo;s a inverse relationship</p>
<p>between inflation and social cohesion,</p>
<p>if we could then take inflation to zero,</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t we theoretically increase</p>
<p>social cohesion to its maximum?</p>
<p>So another way to say that is inflation</p>
<p>is a decivilizing force, whereas natural price deflation,</p>
<p>which would occur in a hard money economy,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s either a fixed supply of Bitcoin</p>
<p>or a relatively scarce supply of gold, for instance,</p>
<p>that lays claim to an increasing capital stock</p>
<p>of goods and services, prices would naturally decline</p>
<p>every year as we became smarter.</p>
<p>So the market price becomes a reflection</p>
<p>of our collective knowledge.</p>
<p>So by letting prices decline naturally over time,</p>
<p>we can actually induce civilization.</p>
<p>But by trying to force prices higher all the time</p>
<p>via the central bank, we&rsquo;re creating the opposite effect.</p>
<p>So we talked a little bit about the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>and I happened to have lived through the collapse</p>
<p>of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>And so what are the factors, the causes in your mind</p>
<p>to why the Soviet Union collapsed?</p>
<p>So, you know, definitely a multivariate situation.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of factors.</p>
<p>One that jumped out to me recently,</p>
<p>again, from that documentary that I didn&rsquo;t note before</p>
<p>was that at one point, Stalin eliminated,</p>
<p>I think 75% of his intelligence force,</p>
<p>which I think when you&rsquo;re competing</p>
<p>with another nation state, you know,</p>
<p>and intelligence and covert operations</p>
<p>are very integral to your survival,</p>
<p>I think that was definitely a shot in the foot.</p>
<p>But at a higher level, I would say that capitalism</p>
<p>and communism were each resource strategies</p>
<p>of the 20th century nation state.</p>
<p>And they seem, you know, we commonly consider them</p>
<p>to be diametrically opposed,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s actually a lot of commonality between the two.</p>
<p>The difference would be that in Soviet Russia,</p>
<p>as we alluded to earlier,</p>
<p>they tried to completely replace price signals</p>
<p>with this nationalistic faith and devotion.</p>
<p>So they removed the economic nerve signal,</p>
<p>which coordinated the allocation of capital over time.</p>
<p>So this inhibited their ability to generate wealth.</p>
<p>Whereas in the United States,</p>
<p>we left most markets open to free enterprise.</p>
<p>So we honored the integrity of price signals</p>
<p>and we allowed people to trade and accumulate wealth.</p>
<p>So in every market, except the market for money,</p>
<p>both markets maintained a central bank as we&rsquo;ve gotten to.</p>
<p>So I think in a really big picture standpoint,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why capitalism outcompetes communism</p>
<p>is because it is able to generate more wealth</p>
<p>than communism was,</p>
<p>and therefore was able to put financial pressure</p>
<p>on the USSR until it reached the point of bankruptcy,</p>
<p>essentially.</p>
<p>A similar model, I would argue,</p>
<p>is that for the same reasons we saw</p>
<p>capitalism outcompete communism,</p>
<p>which I think the data that I recall</p>
<p>was that the USSR&rsquo;s economy was valued</p>
<p>at close to one third of its inputs.</p>
<p>So if you just didn&rsquo;t do anything inside the USSR</p>
<p>and just sold all the raw materials that were going into it,</p>
<p>it would have been worth three times as much</p>
<p>as sending the materials in,</p>
<p>running it through the efforts</p>
<p>and then shipping things back out.</p>
<p>It was value destructive versus value creative.</p>
<p>And I would argue this is because,</p>
<p>again, the centralized computing model</p>
<p>versus decentralized computing model,</p>
<p>it just became more and more corrupt over time.</p>
<p>It got to the point where I think most of the occupations</p>
<p>in USSR towards the end were as informants, right?</p>
<p>They were working for the state.</p>
<p>Jordan Peterson makes this point too,</p>
<p>that at some point it was actually illegal</p>
<p>to be sad in Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>Because if you were sad,</p>
<p>you were contradicting the utopian view of the state.</p>
<p>So if you were sad,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re implying the state&rsquo;s not doing something wrong.</p>
<p>But by the way, this does remind me,</p>
<p>do you know what Jordan Peterson thinks about Bitcoin</p>
<p>and about the future impact of Bitcoin on the society?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t actually.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re hopefully gonna be talking to him soon about that.</p>
<p>We did a book club on his book, Maps of Meaning,</p>
<p>and he engaged with us about it.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re hoping to deliver the orange bill to Mr. Peterson.</p>
<p>The orange bill.</p>
<p>I think his audience is one of the most important audiences</p>
<p>in the world to understand Bitcoin,</p>
<p>these people that are conscientious and responsible.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;ll quickly understand Bitcoin&rsquo;s</p>
<p>value proposition and help elucidate it to the world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to remember what he said about it.</p>
<p>Basically, I think his support of Bitcoin</p>
<p>is grounded in the kind of people</p>
<p>who are opposing Bitcoin.</p>
<p>So without understanding Bitcoin,</p>
<p>he starts to like Bitcoin</p>
<p>because of the people who are opposing it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s, you know, you start to, I mean,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s partially why I am interested in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like all the people in power</p>
<p>and all the kind of shady, fraudulent,</p>
<p>non genuine people who are dismissing Bitcoin</p>
<p>are making me think, hmm.</p>
<p>One of Jordan&rsquo;s definitions of God is,</p>
<p>he says, God is found in the truthful speech</p>
<p>that rectifies pathological hierarchies.</p>
<p>And I think that is a beautiful definition</p>
<p>of what Bitcoin is doing in the world.</p>
<p>And that we have this pathological hierarchy</p>
<p>called central banking,</p>
<p>by which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer,</p>
<p>that is used as a mechanism for perpetual theft</p>
<p>and funding warfare at a global scale.</p>
<p>Like Ron Paul said, it&rsquo;s no coincidence</p>
<p>that the 20th century of total war</p>
<p>was also the century of central banking.</p>
<p>When you have an institution of currency counterfeiting,</p>
<p>which the central bank is,</p>
<p>you are no longer bounded by your own balance sheet</p>
<p>when you go to war.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to just go to war on your own resources.</p>
<p>You can now pillage the commonwealth</p>
<p>and pull for the savings of society as a whole</p>
<p>before you go bankrupt.</p>
<p>And indeed, this is what Hitler did, right?</p>
<p>Hitler hyperinflated in the Weimar Republic</p>
<p>to fund his war efforts.</p>
<p>And frankly, every dictator, every world war,</p>
<p>every internment camp in history was made possible</p>
<p>by the weaponization of money in fiat currency.</p>
<p>So I hope, I know Jordan Peterson</p>
<p>is a huge proponent of free speech.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s ultimately at its deepest essence,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what Bitcoin really is, right?</p>
<p>It is just the purest form</p>
<p>of monetary speech we&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
<p>And by purifying that primary operating system</p>
<p>of human action, I think we can eliminate</p>
<p>this pathological hierarchy that is unfortunately</p>
<p>the dominant institution in the world today.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m definitely,</p>
<p>especially with these explorations of Bitcoin,</p>
<p>this journey I&rsquo;ve been on,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll revisit some of the aspects of human history</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been looking at like Stalin and Hitler</p>
<p>with a, from a perspective of a monetary perspective,</p>
<p>like what are the effects of inflation?</p>
<p>How was it used as a tool in gaining power</p>
<p>and maintaining power and manipulating the populace</p>
<p>in doing, in inflicting suffering</p>
<p>and I would say evil onto the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have to sort of go back into the hole.</p>
<p>So I tend to focus more on the human nature</p>
<p>and less about the tools</p>
<p>that human nature leverages to affect change.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re right that in some sense,</p>
<p>money is a tool which can be effectively used</p>
<p>to perform moral and immoral actions</p>
<p>depending on how it&rsquo;s used.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a feedback between the two, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, specifically with money itself,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the, here&rsquo;s the way I&rsquo;ve been posing it lately</p>
<p>is that I actually think we typically think of people</p>
<p>as good or bad, or again,</p>
<p>trying to label people all the time,</p>
<p>but I think people and their characters</p>
<p>are emergent properties of the incentive structures</p>
<p>they inhabit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, you know, what does Charlie Munger say?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t show me the incentives,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll show you the outcome kind of thing.</p>
<p>This is a flawed incentive structure</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been operating within.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m not speaking to the intention.</p>
<p>People want to argue with me all the time.</p>
<p>Like Jerome Powell&rsquo;s not a bad guy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s doing his best at the central bank.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s doing what he thinks is right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s true or not, it actually doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>The intention is divergent from the outcome.</p>
<p>The institution that they are running</p>
<p>is premised on deception and theft,</p>
<p>and it is handicapping the productive economy.</p>
<p>So when we&rsquo;re, even the terms we use, printing money,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not creating any new value.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not infusing the economy with anything,</p>
<p>any new productive factors whatsoever.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just creating new value.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not infusing the economy with anything,</p>
<p>any new productive factors whatsoever.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just harvesting the economic surplus</p>
<p>created by entrepreneurs in the marketplace.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible to add any value to an economy</p>
<p>by increasing the paper claims on its savings.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a feedback loop between man and tool,</p>
<p>between creator and created.</p>
<p>And I think we have to honor the relationship</p>
<p>above either one, right?</p>
<p>Trying to put the right people in the system</p>
<p>in the right place.</p>
<p>Do you think the interesting question</p>
<p>of whether the people that are in control of central banks</p>
<p>or in positions of power there,</p>
<p>if they themselves are malevolent,</p>
<p>they themselves are bad actors,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re simply like leaves floating along the river,</p>
<p>sort of just the cog in the machine,</p>
<p>an ant in an ant colony</p>
<p>that operates in a certain kind of way.</p>
<p>Like, where do you put the blame?</p>
<p>Do you put the blame on the way things are operating</p>
<p>onto the individuals or onto the system itself,</p>
<p>the idea behind the system?</p>
<p>Where, and is it useful to place the blame somewhere?</p>
<p>Because for me, it might be useful to understand that</p>
<p>in order to figure out what the solution is.</p>
<p>I tend to not put the blame on the individual.</p>
<p>Like I tend to believe most people are good</p>
<p>and want to see themselves as good.</p>
<p>And so in that case, it&rsquo;s very difficult</p>
<p>to be truly malevolent as you would need to be to control,</p>
<p>to gain centralized power at the large scale.</p>
<p>But I know a lot of conspiracy theorists</p>
<p>and just a lot of people think that there is evil humans</p>
<p>in the world that seek power, maintain that power,</p>
<p>and then use that power for bad purposes.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re just people.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re just trying to get something for nothing,</p>
<p>like all of us do.</p>
<p>I like this framework of thought.</p>
<p>Well, honestly, and that&rsquo;s what the central bank is,</p>
<p>is the ultimate institution to get something for nothing.</p>
<p>You get a perpetual income stream,</p>
<p>the ability to acquire more and more territory in the world</p>
<p>through monopolizing the supply of money.</p>
<p>And you can literally print money.</p>
<p>You can buy your way out of anything</p>
<p>and buy your way into anything in the world.</p>
<p>So it is, I think the most, not say the most,</p>
<p>but a group of very intelligent people</p>
<p>put this thing together and figured out</p>
<p>how to get something for nothing in perpetuity</p>
<p>by clouding people&rsquo;s conception of money.</p>
<p>And if we look at the central bank is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been around for a while,</p>
<p>but the latest implementation here in the US is the Fed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about a hundred years old.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an analog age institution that I think has lost</p>
<p>a lot of its relevance in the modern age.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think it will survive</p>
<p>the ever galvanizing gaze of the digital age.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just too much sunlight, too much transparency today.</p>
<p>Ideas move too quickly for something like this</p>
<p>to remain relevant.</p>
<p>But they are just people.</p>
<p>They are just seeking something for nothing.</p>
<p>But I think when you concentrate that much power</p>
<p>and that much control, that much wealth</p>
<p>into the hands of few, it does change.</p>
<p>Hayek argued that the nature of power,</p>
<p>again, it&rsquo;s something that we all sort of desire.</p>
<p>To be completely powerless, you&rsquo;re really unhappy, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re totally powerless, you&rsquo;re a slave.</p>
<p>Someone else tells you what to do.</p>
<p>You have no autonomy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s miserable, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this, it makes the consolidation</p>
<p>of power alluring and that we want to protect ourselves</p>
<p>from that slave state, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>But like many things, it can be taken too far.</p>
<p>And when you concentrate power into too few hands,</p>
<p>Hayek argues that it actually transforms.</p>
<p>It becomes something much more intoxicating</p>
<p>than it would be if it was held in a more distributed way.</p>
<p>And I think that gets into a lot of these,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they call themselves elites</p>
<p>or people call them elites or whatever,</p>
<p>like let&rsquo;s say shareholders of central banks,</p>
<p>people participating in the World Economic Forum,</p>
<p>things like this.</p>
<p>They come, I guess the incentives, right?</p>
<p>The incentive schema they&rsquo;re in is rewarding them constantly,</p>
<p>telling them everything they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>saying and thinking is correct</p>
<p>because they just keep getting richer all the time.</p>
<p>And it leads you closer to this definition of evil,</p>
<p>which in the book, Paradise Lost,</p>
<p>Friedman said, evil is the force</p>
<p>which believes its knowledge is complete.</p>
<p>So these people become more and more convinced</p>
<p>that they have the plan or they have the course of action</p>
<p>that will save the world,</p>
<p>that if everyone would just listen to them,</p>
<p>that they would lead us to the promised land, right?</p>
<p>Whether this is Bill Gates saving us from a climate crisis</p>
<p>or any of these other economic policies</p>
<p>that are targeted at a certain outcome,</p>
<p>but almost always diverge almost perfectly</p>
<p>from that outcome, creating its opposite effect.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the problem,</p>
<p>that we have this mechanism that can concentrate wealth</p>
<p>and power into the hands of so few</p>
<p>that it leads to the proliferation of evil,</p>
<p>meaning that it convinces people</p>
<p>that their knowledge is complete.</p>
<p>Whereas something like a Bitcoin</p>
<p>almost forces the opposite outcome.</p>
<p>In a Bitcoin denominated world, a pure free market,</p>
<p>the consumer is sovereign.</p>
<p>So you cannot earn value in the world</p>
<p>unless you are serving your fellow man,</p>
<p>unless they have expressed through their buy and sell</p>
<p>decisions in the marketplace, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve created a satisfaction of a particular want</p>
<p>that they value so much,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve acquired so much of your good or service</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve become rich.</p>
<p>You can only maintain that position of wealth</p>
<p>so long as you continue to serve your fellow man.</p>
<p>So it changes the incentives such that dominance</p>
<p>in the world can no longer be paired with coercion.</p>
<p>It has to be paired with competence.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how this, when we say Bitcoin fixes this,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we mean.</p>
<p>Like it restores that skin in the game,</p>
<p>that balance of incentives and disincentives</p>
<p>that help us properly navigate reality.</p>
<p>And it prevents the buildup of systemic rot</p>
<p>like we see with the central bank.</p>
<p>What books?</p>
<p>People love this question.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re exceptionally well read.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve explored all kinds of ideas.</p>
<p>Is there some books, technical, fiction, philosophical,</p>
<p>coloring books, children&rsquo;s books had an impact on your life</p>
<p>and you would maybe recommend to others</p>
<p>that they should read?</p>
<p>I think we mentioned a couple of them here today,</p>
<p>but I think a really useful triplet of books</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been recommending recently</p>
<p>to help diffuse this materialist worldview of reality</p>
<p>where we still think in kind of the Newtonian model</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s atoms and cause and effect.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d first recommend Jordan Peterson&rsquo;s book,</p>
<p>Maps of Meaning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a deep dive into mythology</p>
<p>and how it&rsquo;s developed over the course of history</p>
<p>and how it&rsquo;s reflected both in our social structures</p>
<p>and our intra psychic nature really,</p>
<p>and how they come to reflect one another in a way.</p>
<p>Like the way we think again shapes the world</p>
<p>and then the way the world is shaped,</p>
<p>shapes the way we think.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an excellent book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very dense and difficult read.</p>
<p>Actually this trilogy is pretty brutal.</p>
<p>Probably take you a year to read, hours a day.</p>
<p>The second one I mentioned earlier</p>
<p>was Human Action by Mises.</p>
<p>The ultimate tome on Austrian economics</p>
<p>will help explicate this realm of relevance.</p>
<p>I think that economics truly is where again,</p>
<p>there are things and then these things become means or ends</p>
<p>once we channel our purpose through them.</p>
<p>So this realm of non materialist relevance</p>
<p>that I think is really important to grasping economics</p>
<p>at a first principles level,</p>
<p>I think that book lays it out tremendously.</p>
<p>And then the last one would be,</p>
<p>I think I mentioned this at the beginning,</p>
<p>was that book Lila by Robert Persig,</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s making the case that value is fundamental.</p>
<p>And all of these books,</p>
<p>they kind of all point to that actually.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re pointing back to value being the fundamental thing,</p>
<p>values expressed through moral action</p>
<p>as being the fundamental substrate of reality.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re like me, I grew up quite scientific minded.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll help diffuse some of that</p>
<p>and maybe retrain you to the other side of reality.</p>
<p>So you said these books are difficult.</p>
<p>Maybe you can comment on which aspect is difficult.</p>
<p>Is it just the technical nature?</p>
<p>Is it the length?</p>
<p>Is it the depth of the ideas</p>
<p>or how long it takes to integrate them?</p>
<p>And more sort of importantly,</p>
<p>is there recommendation advice you can give</p>
<p>on how to integrate these ideas,</p>
<p>how to read, how to learn in the spaces there</p>
<p>from your own life?</p>
<p>Like how do you enjoy taking in ideas?</p>
<p>And this could be for these books,</p>
<p>but also in the Bitcoin world</p>
<p>and reading a bunch of different ideas written by others,</p>
<p>just integrating stuff, even watching podcasts</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m a reader.</p>
<p>I love to read.</p>
<p>One of the most useful things I&rsquo;ve ever done</p>
<p>was take a speed reading course.</p>
<p>I actually think there&rsquo;s a version of this</p>
<p>available on Tim Ferriss&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a 30 minute speed reading course.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about eye movement.</p>
<p>Instead of moving your eye continuously line over line,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more about jumping in your brain.</p>
<p>You can train your brain to just absorb words</p>
<p>in their totality versus kind of reading word by word.</p>
<p>And also not, I haven&rsquo;t fully taken that journey actually,</p>
<p>but I remember taking a few steps on that journey,</p>
<p>realizing that I&rsquo;m speaking inside my head.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying the words inside my head</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s actually getting in the way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of little hacks like that.</p>
<p>I maybe lazily, now that you mentioned,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to revisit this.</p>
<p>But I have convinced myself that I don&rsquo;t need to read faster</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s not ultimately the bottleneck.</p>
<p>The bottleneck is in me thinking about stuff.</p>
<p>In fact, I like reading really slowly</p>
<p>or so I convinced myself.</p>
<p>Because ultimately it&rsquo;s not about gaining more information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about time spent thinking deeply.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>But maybe that&rsquo;s just me being very lazy</p>
<p>because yes, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to think deeply,</p>
<p>but maybe I could speed up the consumption of information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I like to be dynamic actually.</p>
<p>So usually speed reading initially</p>
<p>and that diffused that internal dialogue for me</p>
<p>because when I was reading one word at a time,</p>
<p>I was having that too.</p>
<p>You almost get a feedback in your own head</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re reading the word out loud</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s clouding your thoughts.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re speed reading, you can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re taking in groups of words at a time</p>
<p>so you can&rsquo;t internally verbalize it, I guess.</p>
<p>And then I also am really big on annotating,</p>
<p>underlining, writing in the margins.</p>
<p>I prefer a physical book,</p>
<p>but I also read the Kindle a lot</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just so convenient.</p>
<p>Anywhere you&rsquo;re waiting in line or every night before bed,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading my Kindle.</p>
<p>And I also advocate rereading a lot.</p>
<p>So if you found something that struck you at a deep level</p>
<p>or you found particularly fascinating,</p>
<p>like you have to listen to that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your, I don&rsquo;t know, your mind or your spirit signal</p>
<p>that that is something meaningful to you</p>
<p>and you should, to your point, reread it,</p>
<p>sit with it for a long time, write about it.</p>
<p>And that becomes the ultimate triumvirate</p>
<p>of synthesizing an idea, actually.</p>
<p>If you can read about it and then write about it</p>
<p>and then go and talk about it,</p>
<p>you get this crystallization of understanding</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just not possible doing any one of the three</p>
<p>or any two of the three.</p>
<p>So I definitely highly recommend people to do that.</p>
<p>And in terms of how are those books difficult?</p>
<p>I mean, and if you&rsquo;re reading a lot of books,</p>
<p>are difficult, I mean, in every way,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all long books.</p>
<p>In terms of density, I would say Lila is the less,</p>
<p>the least dense, maybe Maps of Meaning.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but Maps of Meaning</p>
<p>and Human Action are both extremely dense.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re just, I had to read those books very slow.</p>
<p>That you just have to take your time with them.</p>
<p>To give you an idea with Jordan Peterson,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s said this a lot with Maps of Meaning.</p>
<p>He spent three hours a day writing for 15 years</p>
<p>to write that book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably, I think it&rsquo;s a 600 page book.</p>
<p>He said he estimates he rewrote every sentence</p>
<p>in the book 50 times, five, zero,</p>
<p>to try and get it just perfected.</p>
<p>And when you read these sentences,</p>
<p>you can tell that he rewrote it 50 times.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used actually Anki for spaced repetition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a piece of, it&rsquo;s an app.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;re familiar with it,</p>
<p>but it allows you to load in facts or terms</p>
<p>or entire paragraphs.</p>
<p>And then it brings them, you review them every day</p>
<p>and then it brings them up less and less often over time</p>
<p>as you show yourself being able to remember</p>
<p>the thing that you wanted to memorize.</p>
<p>And oftentimes when I&rsquo;m reading,</p>
<p>what I want to memorize is the key idea.</p>
<p>But also like I use it for, I&rsquo;m terrible with names.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m starting to use it for names too,</p>
<p>names of people, names of like people</p>
<p>that I want to remember.</p>
<p>And also throughout history and also in my own personal life</p>
<p>but also events, you know, dates to me</p>
<p>are usually not important,</p>
<p>but sometimes dates are really important.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s really useful.</p>
<p>I recommend it highly.</p>
<p>Naval, I think mentioned a piece of software</p>
<p>called Readwise or something like that,</p>
<p>that I hope I&rsquo;m saying that correctly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something like that.</p>
<p>And what it does is it goes to your highlights</p>
<p>from your Kindle or the various places</p>
<p>where you highlight stuff that integrates with Goodreads.</p>
<p>And it does the same kind of spaced repetition</p>
<p>but for things you&rsquo;ve highlighted.</p>
<p>So it sends an email every day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been really, I recommend it highly</p>
<p>because it sends like to me an email form,</p>
<p>a selection of the things I&rsquo;ve highlighted</p>
<p>and previous things I&rsquo;ve read.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like this weird like shock to your memory</p>
<p>that sprinkles like I have probably way too much Orwell</p>
<p>in there and it just kind of like, it brings you back.</p>
<p>And these ideas are, because what you realize,</p>
<p>depending on how you highlight, but at least for me,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s probably true for a lot of people,</p>
<p>the things you&rsquo;ve highlighted had at that moment</p>
<p>and like an emotional impact on you.</p>
<p>And so like these things are just like hitting you hard</p>
<p>again, it&rsquo;s like, whoa, it might not be meaningful</p>
<p>to anyone else except you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something I recommend.</p>
<p>You never know with these like hacks or tools and so on,</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s actually BS and what is amazing.</p>
<p>And that one is kind of amazing.</p>
<p>So at least for me, it works for me and Naval.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s the one.</p>
<p>Read wise you said. Read wise.</p>
<p>Or something close to that.</p>
<p>It could be read something else,</p>
<p>like read wealth or something.</p>
<p>The one other thing I really like,</p>
<p>and this is more of a new one,</p>
<p>is I used to always listen to music at the gym,</p>
<p>but now I&rsquo;ve just, because I&rsquo;m so backlogged on podcasts,</p>
<p>right, there&rsquo;s so many, I exclusively listen to podcasts</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m walking or when I&rsquo;m at the gym,</p>
<p>anytime I&rsquo;m doing something that I can&rsquo;t read basically.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s something really special</p>
<p>about exercise and ideation.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if this happens to everyone,</p>
<p>but my creative juices just go ballistic.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m at the gym, like I hit a certain point of,</p>
<p>I guess, heart rate and you&rsquo;re sweating enough,</p>
<p>then the ideas just start to flow.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m basically at the gym now listening to podcasts,</p>
<p>exercising as fast as I can to try to get to that state of,</p>
<p>you know, where you&rsquo;re just straining,</p>
<p>your strenuous exercise, I guess you would say,</p>
<p>and then I end up typing notes into my phone</p>
<p>as fast as I can with all these ideas that are flowing.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve created a lot of good writing out of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s kind of work.</p>
<p>So I do running quite a bit, so running outside,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll listen to, I&rsquo;ve been, okay,</p>
<p>I told myself this has been going on for about a year,</p>
<p>is I only listen, like the stuff that&rsquo;s either World War II</p>
<p>or World War I related.</p>
<p>So Hitler, Stalin, like difficult historical stuff.</p>
<p>And also listen to brown noise.</p>
<p>So those are the two modes.</p>
<p>So brown noise helps me, this is like white noise,</p>
<p>but like deeper, I guess, it helps me remove the world.</p>
<p>And at the gym, there&rsquo;s a lot of distractions.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re running, there&rsquo;s a lot of distractions.</p>
<p>It helps me remove the world.</p>
<p>So one, I&rsquo;ll be listening to difficult historical ideas.</p>
<p>And then when my mind is all of a sudden</p>
<p>starting to generate ideas,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll listen to brown noise and then force myself to think.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of, it&rsquo;s meditative in a sense,</p>
<p>and your mind wants to be lazy.</p>
<p>You want to, it&rsquo;s hard, man, like running and thinking</p>
<p>in the sense that some of the ideas</p>
<p>that come into your head are pretty heavy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about your own life, your own demons come in there,</p>
<p>but also just difficult ideas</p>
<p>that require you thinking through</p>
<p>and persevering through that,</p>
<p>like not letting yourself get lazy</p>
<p>and thinking through it has been really for me rewarding</p>
<p>in the same way that you&rsquo;re saying it is for you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that like podcasts and music,</p>
<p>like shallow, like funny podcasts or music</p>
<p>have been a kind of filler distraction.</p>
<p>But informational podcasts, like podcasts</p>
<p>that have some depths of ideas or audio books</p>
<p>have been truly rewarding.</p>
<p>I try to listen now less and less to podcasts</p>
<p>that are just fun,</p>
<p>because I feel like I enjoy it too much</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t allow my mind to get bored</p>
<p>and to think through stuff, to explore ideas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so easy to fill the space</p>
<p>that usually would be filled with thought</p>
<p>and instead fill it with fun podcasts.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a bunch of comedy podcasts I really enjoy.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s value to that, of course,</p>
<p>but you have to realize it&rsquo;s entertainment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, you don&rsquo;t get much value except entertainment.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s utility to the boredom too, I think,</p>
<p>where to give your mind the space,</p>
<p>I guess your subconscious,</p>
<p>maybe the space to chew on some of these problems, right?</p>
<p>Where you&rsquo;ve imbibed so much knowledge,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve highlighted and thought about something,</p>
<p>but then you need to stop thinking about it for a while</p>
<p>and let it marinate in the subconscious.</p>
<p>And then these flashes of insight</p>
<p>that people have described,</p>
<p>sometimes I get them in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>like I just wake up from a dream and have them</p>
<p>and I got to write it down</p>
<p>or sometimes just in nature taking a walk.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s very important too.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t just brute force our way into understanding.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this interplay between</p>
<p>kind of the brute force reading intake</p>
<p>and then just relaxing, meditating, sleeping, being bored,</p>
<p>letting your subconscious do the heavy lifting.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, you should be aware of the fact</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a war for your attention going on.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been better and better and better mechanisms</p>
<p>that are designed to steal your attention.</p>
<p>So I kind of see it as a war zone</p>
<p>between my right for boredom</p>
<p>and the internet wanting your attention.</p>
<p>In fact, Clubhouse as an app has been,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably not gonna use Clubhouse much anymore.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some aspect of my own inner loneliness</p>
<p>and whatever it is that pulled me into Clubhouse</p>
<p>a little bit too much to where it robbed me</p>
<p>from that lonely time alone</p>
<p>where I sit and listen to Bruce Springsteen</p>
<p>and think about life, right?</p>
<p>So I wanna.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s way more important.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s way, well yeah, at least it&rsquo;s all in balance</p>
<p>because there is a Clubhouse like a lot</p>
<p>of these social networks when you use right</p>
<p>can be a way to discover new ideas, new people.</p>
<p>But the boredom is just being alone</p>
<p>with your thoughts is priceless.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And you gotta know yourself, right?</p>
<p>Like it took me a long time to realize I need solitude.</p>
<p>Like just how I&rsquo;m wired, how I&rsquo;m built.</p>
<p>I need like an hour a day solitude.</p>
<p>So you gotta listen to that part of yourself.</p>
<p>You might be compromising something like that</p>
<p>where you feel like you always need to be</p>
<p>with your girlfriend or whatever it may be.</p>
<p>But I would suggest listening to that voice.</p>
<p>Yeah, I try to, I tried to remember things</p>
<p>that made me feel good over time.</p>
<p>Like longterm had positive impact</p>
<p>and longterm had negative impact</p>
<p>and do more of the former and less of the latter.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t often think like that.</p>
<p>You know, we talked offline about like carnivore diets</p>
<p>for example, I try to remember</p>
<p>that carbs don&rsquo;t make me feel good.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In the moment it&rsquo;s hard to remember that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard, it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>But you have to remember that that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>And in the same way, exercise,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to remember that exercise makes me feel good.</p>
<p>Like especially when it&rsquo;s time to go to the gym, right?</p>
<p>Especially when it&rsquo;s time to go to the gym.</p>
<p>But you should remember that</p>
<p>because the kind of person you are without exercise,</p>
<p>for me, just like you beautifully said</p>
<p>that you have to know yourself.</p>
<p>The kind of person I am without exercise</p>
<p>is a less good person, a person I&rsquo;m less proud of.</p>
<p>The food thing is so hard.</p>
<p>By the way, I still, you know,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve learned the lesson,</p>
<p>like don&rsquo;t eat that.</p>
<p>But then, you know, you go a few weeks</p>
<p>of not eating whatever that is,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re feeling good.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>something creeps up inside you.</p>
<p>Like, ah, you could just have one or you could just do this.</p>
<p>But for me, it&rsquo;s sugar.</p>
<p>Like sugar just makes me feel terrible.</p>
<p>But I always, not always, but if it&rsquo;s been a long time,</p>
<p>I start to make that exception in my mind.</p>
<p>Like, oh, you can have a little bit.</p>
<p>And then I eat it and I feel terrible.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know how many times I&rsquo;ve done that dance,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not cool.</p>
<p>Well, it depends on how painful it is</p>
<p>and then you learn the lesson.</p>
<p>I actually embraced the fact</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll never learn the lesson with vodka.</p>
<p>Every time I drink, especially with Russians,</p>
<p>is like, I quit drinking every time.</p>
<p>And then I forget, there&rsquo;s like a slow drop off.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be like two weeks and then.</p>
<p>Na zdorovie.</p>
<p>Na zdorovie, very good.</p>
<p>So it never makes you feel good.</p>
<p>It never results in anything good</p>
<p>except the beautiful social chaos,</p>
<p>which is ultimately somehow, there&rsquo;s value to chaos too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s value to that.</p>
<p>Whatever the hell stupid stuff you do when you get trashed.</p>
<p>The over the top emotion of love usually</p>
<p>or whatever camaraderie, there&rsquo;s value to that too.</p>
<p>Like as I get older, I realize,</p>
<p>because the world,</p>
<p>sometimes especially when you get older</p>
<p>and the world wants you to be an adult,</p>
<p>in order to maintain the youthful spirit,</p>
<p>you have to use all the tools you can.</p>
<p>Alcohol is one of them.</p>
<p>To do all the stupid shit you can,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re like getting older.</p>
<p>To lower the inhibitions.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s that taste of uncertainty</p>
<p>that is the sweetness of life, right?</p>
<p>To be able to go out and be a flaneur at a party</p>
<p>and not really know what you&rsquo;re gonna do.</p>
<p>And we have this draw to the wild side of life.</p>
<p>As much as we try and build up order around ourselves,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s always gonna be an appetite for that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always, most of my life,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a social drinker,</p>
<p>but I actually gave up alcohol a year ago.</p>
<p>And I would add that to the idea,</p>
<p>the repertoire for dealing with bigger ideas</p>
<p>because alcohol is fun, it&rsquo;s amazing, good times.</p>
<p>It can be analgesic, it can give you all these benefits</p>
<p>if you use the right amounts.</p>
<p>But I got to the point personally</p>
<p>where I was trying to wrestle with these ideas</p>
<p>that are just so much bigger than me.</p>
<p>And I have this backlog of books</p>
<p>that was growing faster than I could read them</p>
<p>that I just reached a point where I decided</p>
<p>I wanted to start making sacrifices toward attaining that.</p>
<p>And alcohol was just an easy one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s you spend,</p>
<p>even if you just drink socially on the weekends,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably spending five to 10 hours drinking</p>
<p>and then maybe another, what?</p>
<p>Five to 10 hours recovering perhaps on the day after.</p>
<p>So it was a difficult transition initially,</p>
<p>but once you get through a couple of months,</p>
<p>I feel amazing without it.</p>
<p>I sleep better than ever.</p>
<p>My workouts are better than ever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sharper than ever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more lucid.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not trying to be a proponent for not drinking,</p>
<p>but I just want to say.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re a proponent for sacrifice.</p>
<p>I am a big proponent for sacrifice, yes.</p>
<p>Is there advice you would give to a young person today</p>
<p>curious about Bitcoin,</p>
<p>curious about how they succeed in the world</p>
<p>or both career wise and just in life in general?</p>
<p>I mean, the strongest piece of advice I have for,</p>
<p>this is beyond just Bitcoin.</p>
<p>This is you managing your own personal and financial affairs</p>
<p>is that you need to invest in knowledge first.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not good enough to just follow the crowd</p>
<p>and buy a 60, 40 portfolio and put it in a Roth RA</p>
<p>and plan on social security.</p>
<p>I mean, the world&rsquo;s changing much faster</p>
<p>than any existing institution</p>
<p>is going to be able to keep up with.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I like,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s why I named the show,</p>
<p>the question, what is money?</p>
<p>Like, I think that to me is the rabbit</p>
<p>that took me down the rabbit holes.</p>
<p>Like just asking that question naturally progressed</p>
<p>to these other questions.</p>
<p>Like what is value?</p>
<p>What is government?</p>
<p>What is the purpose of society?</p>
<p>Speech, all of these things.</p>
<p>So I would encourage people to arm yourself</p>
<p>with knowledge and study.</p>
<p>And like that, a lot of financial people</p>
<p>always give you a line of advice</p>
<p>and then say, this is not financial advice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, this is financial advice.</p>
<p>Like study, study, learn.</p>
<p>Knowledge is power.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is official financial advice.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re exercising your divine trait,</p>
<p>which is the logos, right?</p>
<p>That we are these animals</p>
<p>that can tell and believe stories.</p>
<p>So it feels like almost a sacred duty</p>
<p>to really sharpen that part of ourselves</p>
<p>and use it to create the best world possible.</p>
<p>And then the second one was the,</p>
<p>I think health and fitness stuff.</p>
<p>I was, maybe everyone does this in their 20s.</p>
<p>They just live a little fast and beat themselves up.</p>
<p>Not that I wasn&rsquo;t, like I was living well</p>
<p>and successful by a lot of measures,</p>
<p>but I wish I had maybe got my act together</p>
<p>a little bit sooner.</p>
<p>I just think.</p>
<p>Health wise, morality wise.</p>
<p>Yeah, drinking, I think morality and eating.</p>
<p>I just was kind of doing whatever I wanted in some ways.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>Is there a value to a trajectory</p>
<p>that includes a lot of mistakes?</p>
<p>So maybe you&rsquo;re supposed to make the mistakes in your 20s.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great point.</p>
<p>Maybe the 20s are all about the mistakes.</p>
<p>Accumulate the most mistakes possible.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>As quickly as possible.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t regret any of it,</p>
<p>but now that I&rsquo;m kind of in this place where I feel good</p>
<p>and I know the value of a good night&rsquo;s sleep</p>
<p>and just, I&rsquo;ve more deeply explored my own potential</p>
<p>that I feel maybe a little regretful</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t do this earlier is all I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>So maybe just exploring different sides of yourself.</p>
<p>See what it&rsquo;s like to go and make a bunch of mistakes</p>
<p>and be wild and crazy</p>
<p>and then maybe try to walk the straight and narrow</p>
<p>for a few months and just see what it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably a guy doing vodka shots right now</p>
<p>listening to this podcast with his buddies</p>
<p>and if you are, please take a shot for us</p>
<p>for all the mistakes you should make in your 20s.</p>
<p>And what about love?</p>
<p>We talked about money is ultimately a mechanism</p>
<p>by which you can pave a moral path through life.</p>
<p>To me, one of the purest expressions</p>
<p>that is love broadly defined for a family, for others,</p>
<p>for knowledge, for the world,</p>
<p>is basically an optimistic open view to the world</p>
<p>that embraces all that is beautiful about this world.</p>
<p>So do you think about love often in a personal sense,</p>
<p>romantic, family, friendship, and in the broad sense</p>
<p>about its value in a successful life?</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m blessed to have a two and a half year old daughter</p>
<p>and love is a word we throw around.</p>
<p>I love these potato chips, I love you, man.</p>
<p>I love you, my daughter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got so many different intensities,</p>
<p>I guess you might say.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, my intuition is that</p>
<p>it is something very fundamental to the universe.</p>
<p>Again, I know words don&rsquo;t do it justice,</p>
<p>but if we just proxy love with selfless action,</p>
<p>the whole damn universe is selflessly acting, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just unfolding and it may sound a bit hippy dippy,</p>
<p>but my intuition is just that love</p>
<p>is the core of it somehow.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have anything to back that up really, it&rsquo;s just.</p>
<p>In the way you&rsquo;re framing it, it&rsquo;s making me think</p>
<p>that love, we talked about sort of meditation,</p>
<p>is as opposed to thinking from an egocentric perspective</p>
<p>of you, the individual operating in this world,</p>
<p>is allowing you to be empathetic towards the world</p>
<p>and thereby think of the universe,</p>
<p>think of the world acting through you.</p>
<p>Almost like accepting this notion that ideas have you,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have ideas,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not existing in the universe,</p>
<p>the universe is existing through you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like, that&rsquo;s what selfless in that context means</p>
<p>is like embracing that thought.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a weird thought.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a weird thought that we&rsquo;re just here for a little bit</p>
<p>of time, these meat vehicles, receptacles,</p>
<p>and this much bigger thing is just using us,</p>
<p>not in a malevolent way, but just like a river flows,</p>
<p>is using us to create more and more beautiful things.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, more and more beautiful things.</p>
<p>We are the universe experiencing itself, frankly, right?</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a trippy thought, man.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That in some sense the universe created us</p>
<p>to experience itself.</p>
<p>And we are one of the highest forms of beauty</p>
<p>that nature has created, right?</p>
<p>If we just think one of the most complex</p>
<p>and adaptive thing, we&rsquo;re a reflection of nature.</p>
<p>And another thing that comes to mind here is that</p>
<p>Dalio has this quote where he says, truth or more accurately,</p>
<p>an accurate depiction of reality is necessary</p>
<p>for any good outcome.</p>
<p>So when we think that love or value is primary,</p>
<p>I think that too reinforces this thesis</p>
<p>that acting out of love or acting out of proper moral action,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re best reflecting the fundamental nature of reality.</p>
<p>Therefore, you&rsquo;re best creating the best possible outcomes</p>
<p>or the things of the most beauty,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s your artistic expression,</p>
<p>your children, your business, whatever it is.</p>
<p>And Jordan Peterson goes deep into that</p>
<p>where you have to listen to that sense of meaning</p>
<p>in your life.</p>
<p>Or you might have some decision on paper</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so great this way, but your heart says no,</p>
<p>your heart says otherwise.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to listen to my heart throughout</p>
<p>and I think that creates the best outcomes.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, does it make you sad</p>
<p>that you in particular, Robert,</p>
<p>are gonna be dead pretty soon?</p>
<p>As we talk about scarcity, one of the certain things</p>
<p>that ensure the scarcity of the human experience</p>
<p>is the fact that you and your consciousness</p>
<p>are gonna be done, they have a deadline.</p>
<p>Only time and Bitcoin are absolutely scarce.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fortunate, I guess I got started</p>
<p>on this philosophical journey a bit when I was younger,</p>
<p>but I got into Musashi and Sun Tzu quite a bit,</p>
<p>who wrote, Musashi wrote the Book of Five Rings,</p>
<p>Sun Tzu wrote The Art of War.</p>
<p>And one of the things that, I mean,</p>
<p>these guys were just absolute beasts.</p>
<p>They lived and died by the sword</p>
<p>and they were just very great equanimity</p>
<p>about all things in life.</p>
<p>And I also found this kind of in the stoic philosophy</p>
<p>where they just are very cool with everything.</p>
<p>And one of the lines there is that the way of the warrior</p>
<p>is the resolute acceptance of death.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve always tried to think about that.</p>
<p>Like, of course I experienced fear,</p>
<p>I experienced everything that you do on a meat suit, right?</p>
<p>Like anxiety and all the things,</p>
<p>but I always try to have that higher order view of myself</p>
<p>and that it&rsquo;s just a certain experience occurring</p>
<p>at a certain level,</p>
<p>but it shouldn&rsquo;t override your kind of highest order self.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just resolutely accepted death</p>
<p>and that this is your one play in life.</p>
<p>So hopefully that propels me towards proper action.</p>
<p>I think scarcity cannot help, but lead to something good.</p>
<p>Just like with this conversation,</p>
<p>sadly must come to an end.</p>
<p>The scarcity of it is what makes it beautiful.</p>
<p>So Robert, this was one of my favorite conversations</p>
<p>philosophically and in every other level,</p>
<p>just the ideas and the way you express them around Bitcoin,</p>
<p>around morality, around money.</p>
<p>Has been really inspiring and really educational.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re out there fighting the good fight.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re wasting all of this time with me.</p>
<p>It was really fun.</p>
<p>And thank you for coming down to Texas</p>
<p>and having some good old brisket together.</p>
<p>This was really fun, man.</p>
<p>This was awesome.</p>
<p>Thanks for having me, man.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Robert Breedlove.</p>
<p>And thank you to Fundrise, Element, Mugpack, and BetterHelp.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Nassim Nicholas Taleb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The resilient resists shocks and stay the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The antifragile gets better.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
