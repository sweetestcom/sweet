<p>Ôªøthere are people that exercise</p>
<p>seven days a week work out two hours a</p>
<p>day and still</p>
<p>cannot lose even an ounce so the</p>
<p>question is why what makes someone</p>
<p>be able to lose weight and other people</p>
<p>cannot today we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>if you look around you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>notice that most people fall into one of</p>
<p>four</p>
<p>body shapes some people hold a weight in</p>
<p>the stomach</p>
<p>as a sagging belly some people as a</p>
<p>protruded</p>
<p>some people hold their weight in the</p>
<p>saddlebag hip area and the arms</p>
<p>yet other people will be big everywhere</p>
<p>so i developed the body type</p>
<p>system of weight loss and today we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to talk about what&rsquo;s behind that</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s something going on inside</p>
<p>your body that&rsquo;s off or out of balance</p>
<p>the outside is going to be shaped</p>
<p>differently</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s nothing worse than doing all</p>
<p>this work and not getting results</p>
<p>i mean there are people that they just</p>
<p>keep failing and failing and failing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re crazy or lazy or</p>
<p>have low willpower</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re not getting results so</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s about getting to the root</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s very interesting is you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really have a weight problem</p>
<p>i know it sounds weird some of you are</p>
<p>like have you seen me in the mirror</p>
<p>you have a weight symptom it&rsquo;s really a</p>
<p>hormone</p>
<p>problem or a slow metabolism</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s talk about hormones because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of confusion i had a lady</p>
<p>who said i don&rsquo;t need to come to your</p>
<p>seminar dr bird because i had all my</p>
<p>hormones removed</p>
<p>you you have 600 hormones in your body</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to cover each one of them</p>
<p>today i hope you have a notebook now</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not going to cover all this</p>
<p>but the ones we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>are the fat burning hormones but let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just define what a hormone is i need a</p>
<p>volunteer</p>
<p>how about you great once you stand right</p>
<p>here</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like do i have to just go in this</p>
<p>front row</p>
<p>and i need another volunteer yeah how</p>
<p>about you</p>
<p>so you can just stand right here okay so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be the fat cell</p>
<p>okay you&rsquo;re gonna be the thyroid gland</p>
<p>okay okay so now thyroid um</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna communicate i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>just put your fingers in your ear just</p>
<p>pretend like you can&rsquo;t hear me okay</p>
<p>okay good so now thyroid say hello to</p>
<p>the fat cell</p>
<p>hello okay say burn fat</p>
<p>burn fat</p>
<p>okay now do you have any kids three have</p>
<p>you ever</p>
<p>talked to a child he ignored you the</p>
<p>first time what do you do</p>
<p>say it again okay good</p>
<p>burn fat do you actually increase the</p>
<p>volume too yeah yeah</p>
<p>burn fat okay after a while her face is</p>
<p>going to get red</p>
<p>so hormones are the communication sent</p>
<p>across the distance over here and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>supposed to connect</p>
<p>into two little holes they&rsquo;re called</p>
<p>receptors hormones are communications</p>
<p>they have millions of functions but the</p>
<p>one we&rsquo;re talking about is the fat</p>
<p>burning hormone so we have the gland</p>
<p>that makes the hormone</p>
<p>it gets sent to the bloodstream it gets</p>
<p>received and it&rsquo;s supposed to burn fat</p>
<p>most people this is what&rsquo;s going on the</p>
<p>communication is being sent but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>being listened to</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why they keep gaining weight</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>thank you very much and thank you very</p>
<p>much see</p>
<p>now that you understand hormones let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go into the first body type</p>
<p>which which is the thyroid gland</p>
<p>now the thyroid is this body type right</p>
<p>here where you gain weight</p>
<p>all over equally not in any one location</p>
<p>now your thyroid is located right in the</p>
<p>base of your neck right here just put</p>
<p>your fingers on your thyroid</p>
<p>lower yeah right there it&rsquo;s about two</p>
<p>and a half inches wide</p>
<p>it comes from the latin word which means</p>
<p>shield</p>
<p>thyroid because it looks like a little</p>
<p>shield looks like</p>
<p>this okay now</p>
<p>if the thyroid is not working you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to start developing</p>
<p>too much what is called potential</p>
<p>energy what&rsquo;s another name for a</p>
<p>potential</p>
<p>energy fat very good</p>
<p>how many feel like you have too much</p>
<p>potential energy it sounds better</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a better ring to it we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to get a t-shirt i&rsquo;m not fat at</p>
<p>potential energy</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s what it is so fat</p>
<p>how many of you be honest don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>your fat</p>
<p>yeah now why does your body make it</p>
<p>if it just makes you miserable does it</p>
<p>have a purpose</p>
<p>like maybe people think it&rsquo;s a cushion</p>
<p>or an insulator to sit down</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s a survival mechanism</p>
<p>in other words it is developed</p>
<p>on the evolutionary chain of survival so</p>
<p>it helps you against it protects against</p>
<p>starvation</p>
<p>famine and stress so your body</p>
<p>has stored fat to help you</p>
<p>so now you have a different viewpoint</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s trying to help you right but the</p>
<p>question is how do we get rid of it</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>if we have too much well what do most</p>
<p>people do</p>
<p>they go on a diet what do what do they</p>
<p>do</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s a diet it&rsquo;s a starvation</p>
<p>hello so what&rsquo;s going to happen the more</p>
<p>they diet the more they starve</p>
<p>themselves the more they cut calories</p>
<p>the more they count calories portion</p>
<p>control everything in moderation</p>
<p>you end up creating more potential</p>
<p>energy the exact thing you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>get rid of</p>
<p>so the things that people do to lose</p>
<p>weight are the things that are ruining</p>
<p>the metabolism</p>
<p>so with a thyroid you&rsquo;ll have problems</p>
<p>with excess weight because the thyroid</p>
<p>goes into every single cell in the body</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to every weight your cell</p>
<p>is going to expand and get bigger that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why you&rsquo;re big equally everywhere</p>
<p>now the first symptom of a thyroid would</p>
<p>be</p>
<p>cravings to carbohydrates</p>
<p>okay starches</p>
<p>breads pasta cereal crackers biscuits</p>
<p>waffles pancakes muffins sodas</p>
<p>juice alcohol mad dog 20 20.</p>
<p>all of those things are carbohydrates</p>
<p>now how many of you ever ate something</p>
<p>that you know you shouldn&rsquo;t have eaten</p>
<p>at least once before</p>
<p>got one two three four five six</p>
<p>how do people justify it when they eat</p>
<p>something bad</p>
<p>everything in moderation i deserve it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good one</p>
<p>people are starving in russia you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>to eat everything on your plate</p>
<p>just a little bit i&rsquo;ll drink more water</p>
<p>to flush it out</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t be perfect all the time so</p>
<p>when you do something like that</p>
<p>what happens is you end up you have to</p>
<p>make it okay so you</p>
<p>invent a reason for eating that thing</p>
<p>and so it stacks up</p>
<p>um i went to i was at uh the health food</p>
<p>store</p>
<p>and i was shopping and i saw one of my</p>
<p>clients um and she was um i was just</p>
<p>watching i was by the salad bar looking</p>
<p>through the glass and i saw her over</p>
<p>there by the</p>
<p>red section and she kept going close to</p>
<p>this little um</p>
<p>brownie tray i was just watching</p>
<p>to see if she was going to get in and</p>
<p>she would go closer and then she would</p>
<p>back up and</p>
<p>she&rsquo;d look back and come back here and</p>
<p>then eventually she</p>
<p>before she grabbed it she looked looked</p>
<p>left and right and she ate it</p>
<p>and then she looked right up and we</p>
<p>connected eyes</p>
<p>her face turned white as a ghost and she</p>
<p>just went with a shop card this way</p>
<p>so i ran after her and i&rsquo;m saying i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like listen</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s okay just relax because if i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>if i didn&rsquo;t talk to her make it okay she</p>
<p>would just i would never see her again</p>
<p>so people tend to hide those little</p>
<p>secrets with cheating and stuff</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s okay to cheat as long as you tell</p>
<p>me</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t keep a secret just get it out</p>
<p>because all we have to do is we have to</p>
<p>find out why you&rsquo;re craving but if you</p>
<p>have a thyroid problem you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>crave the</p>
<p>the pleasure foods breads potato</p>
<p>starch rice okay uh sourdough bread out</p>
<p>of the oven</p>
<p>with butter okay they like that for some</p>
<p>reason</p>
<p>so um they crave carbohydrates</p>
<p>they have problems with their hair the</p>
<p>hair starts getting thinner</p>
<p>brittle they they lose their hair and</p>
<p>they comb it</p>
<p>because those are proteins they have</p>
<p>problems with their nails they get</p>
<p>vertically ridged nails those are up and</p>
<p>down ridges on the nails</p>
<p>okay let&rsquo;s see what we got here oh you</p>
<p>got yours polished there</p>
<p>oh okay so can you call 9-1-1 please</p>
<p>so the ridges the nails could mean</p>
<p>thyroid the problem with the thyroid</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have loose um skin right here</p>
<p>right here how many of you know anyone</p>
<p>like that maybe like a co-worker or a</p>
<p>relative a neighbor</p>
<p>yeah someone else so we have a thin skin</p>
<p>dry hair you lose your eyebrows on the</p>
<p>outer part right here first</p>
<p>that would be thyroid</p>
<p>thyroid cases have cold feet they throw</p>
<p>socks to bed</p>
<p>someone told me doesn&rsquo;t everyone i go no</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not normal so they have a</p>
<p>temperature problem</p>
<p>so they have problems they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>tired they</p>
<p>they could sleep for many many hours but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s they don&rsquo;t feel refreshed</p>
<p>when they get up okay so that would be</p>
<p>thyroid any question about the thyroid</p>
<p>thyroid cases do not absorb vitamins too</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>okay so vitamins</p>
<p>because the metabolism is so low they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t break those things down</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s over a hundred intracellular</p>
<p>enzymes those are those little chemicals</p>
<p>in the body that break stuff down</p>
<p>that are get shut down with the thyroid</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s very expensive urine to be</p>
<p>taking all these vitamins because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to go right</p>
<p>through you so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just talk as a side note not only</p>
<p>is it a problem with absorption of</p>
<p>vitamins that but most vitamins are made</p>
<p>synthetically</p>
<p>now let&rsquo;s just show you something in</p>
<p>nature vitamins</p>
<p>always come in complexes</p>
<p>ascorbic acid is one part of the vitamin</p>
<p>c</p>
<p>complex okay it&rsquo;s just the antioxidant</p>
<p>its purpose is to protect the real good</p>
<p>stuff which is vitamin j</p>
<p>p k and copper these are</p>
<p>this is a natural vitamin c complex that</p>
<p>comes in nature</p>
<p>this is synthetic right here which is</p>
<p>ascorbic acid</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s very interesting about that is</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>this comes from corn starch and sulfuric</p>
<p>acid that&rsquo;s how they make ascorbic acid</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no vitamin c in corn yet they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>making</p>
<p>vitamin c when it&rsquo;s artificial though</p>
<p>when you</p>
<p>take ascorbic acid in large quantities</p>
<p>which</p>
<p>mainly you&rsquo;ll see in synthetic over 500</p>
<p>milligrams in these pills</p>
<p>which if it was natural be the size of a</p>
<p>golf ball and as a pill</p>
<p>when you take too much of this it will</p>
<p>create deficiencies of these other parts</p>
<p>it will literally create a vitamin c</p>
<p>deficiency i had a guy he went to mexico</p>
<p>and he was going to cancer therapy and</p>
<p>he took all this</p>
<p>100 000 milligrams of injected vitamin c</p>
<p>but it was really ascorbic acid</p>
<p>he ended up with bleeding gums that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>sign of vitamin c deficiency</p>
<p>varicose veins spider veins hemorrhoids</p>
<p>and extreme fatigue that&rsquo;s all the signs</p>
<p>of scurvy</p>
<p>so you always want to look on the back</p>
<p>of label</p>
<p>and be able to read the label to see if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s real like comes from actual plants</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to have to pronounce like</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t pronounce these chemicals okay</p>
<p>so most vitamins are made synthetically</p>
<p>99 and</p>
<p>even the most popular ones which i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to mention any of those vitamins</p>
<p>names okay</p>
<p>centrum silver but what happens is that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another one called calcium</p>
<p>carbonate that&rsquo;s a mineral</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sold as a</p>
<p>calcium supplement right calcium</p>
<p>carbonate is limestone</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like a rock</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be better off chewing on the</p>
<p>cement out there</p>
<p>than you would taking that vitamin so</p>
<p>when you take your vitamin and you feel</p>
<p>this heavy bottle</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a paper weight it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>mainly calcium carbonate which is</p>
<p>limestone</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to be absorbed it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>going to it&rsquo;s going to cause kidney</p>
<p>stones</p>
<p>so read the labels make sure the</p>
<p>vitamins and minerals come from plants</p>
<p>that you can pronounce not synthetics</p>
<p>most</p>
<p>vitamins or minerals are made from</p>
<p>metals</p>
<p>or rocks or salts which</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really get absorbed so there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>big difference when people say there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no difference there&rsquo;s a big difference</p>
<p>and then compound that the fact that you</p>
<p>have a thyroid case you can&rsquo;t absorb</p>
<p>anything no wonder we have</p>
<p>that the vitamins that you take aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really working</p>
<p>okay now the next body type we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to talk about</p>
<p>is going to be called the adrenal</p>
<p>now the adrenal gland sits on top of the</p>
<p>kidney</p>
<p>right here you&rsquo;ve got two of them go</p>
<p>ahead and put your fingers on your</p>
<p>adrenals</p>
<p>now the adrenal gland is a stress gland</p>
<p>how many ever experienced stress before</p>
<p>got one two</p>
<p>three four five six give me an example</p>
<p>of what stresses people</p>
<p>out work traffic</p>
<p>children kids husbands</p>
<p>being overweight school relationships</p>
<p>life finances wow you guys can relate to</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>um how many have ever had a stressful</p>
<p>relationship before at least once</p>
<p>twice okay we&rsquo;ll stop right there</p>
<p>um so the adrenal reacts and adapts the</p>
<p>body to stress</p>
<p>so if you pretend like you&rsquo;re being</p>
<p>chased by a tiger for the next 10 years</p>
<p>and how your body would react to that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what happens with the adrenals</p>
<p>over time when it burns out</p>
<p>well if you&rsquo;re being chased by a tiger</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to be able to sleep</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to be able to reproduce</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re going to have problems with</p>
<p>hormones</p>
<p>reproductive hormones you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>problems with digestion</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting problems with blood</p>
<p>pressure and cholesterol and all these</p>
<p>other things with blood sugars because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re running on sugar so i&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>go through all of them</p>
<p>but the adrenals regulate stress and</p>
<p>stress</p>
<p>does accumulate yes you&rsquo;re like a bucket</p>
<p>and you filled up in fact there is</p>
<p>always some stress</p>
<p>that has occurred right before you</p>
<p>started</p>
<p>developing a stubborn weight issue</p>
<p>always</p>
<p>if you ask a person they think it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>calories right well</p>
<p>if you take it back when did you start</p>
<p>gaining weight what happened just before</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to find that they had a</p>
<p>baby c-section a surgery</p>
<p>a hysterectomy tubal ligation they got</p>
<p>married</p>
<p>they got a divorce on that same day now</p>
<p>they have just a lot of different</p>
<p>stresses i&rsquo;ve had people even as kids be</p>
<p>be overweight and many times it comes</p>
<p>after an asthma attack</p>
<p>or an ear infection or a throat</p>
<p>infection so many things that can stress</p>
<p>the body out</p>
<p>but stress does accumulate and over time</p>
<p>you develop too many applications on</p>
<p>your</p>
<p>desktop computer which is your body</p>
<p>so all these things accumulate and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just like a bucket of stress</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind some people when we measure</p>
<p>the inside of you are so jacked up</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t sleep they can&rsquo;t relax so i</p>
<p>would say</p>
<p>probably the biggest thing that stresses</p>
<p>people out are other</p>
<p>people is that true there&rsquo;s certain</p>
<p>personality types that kind of get to</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>you got the whiner right they&rsquo;re like um</p>
<p>will you please help me will you please</p>
<p>help me</p>
<p>do they ever accept your help no</p>
<p>you just want to help you just want to</p>
<p>like okay let me push you downstairs now</p>
<p>you want my help</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like you have winders you have</p>
<p>the antagonistic person who&rsquo;s rude</p>
<p>you have the real depressed person that</p>
<p>brings you down</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll give them a solution they say no</p>
<p>that will never work or you have those</p>
<p>really happy people that are always this</p>
<p>happy</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t stress me out but sometimes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like if you&rsquo;re depressed you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really like these happy people</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just too positive all the time</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s one personality type</p>
<p>that really gets on my nerves and they</p>
<p>call it the um</p>
<p>passive aggressive called underminers</p>
<p>now let me show you what they what they</p>
<p>look like so everyone look at me very</p>
<p>very</p>
<p>hostile right now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re smiling look at me very mean</p>
<p>okay now smile hi</p>
<p>nice to meet you they&rsquo;re gonna backstab</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>to your face they told you they stood up</p>
<p>for you but they actually ruin your</p>
<p>reputation</p>
<p>they love gossip how many of you know</p>
<p>anyone like that</p>
<p>they give you a compliment but they</p>
<p>follow it up with a sharp critical</p>
<p>comment</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll say something like hey that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>nice jacket was it on sale</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like who would ever say that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like oh that&rsquo;s a nice haircut</p>
<p>did you get at cheap cuts my uncle</p>
<p>i mean um actually yes it was my uncle</p>
<p>um he goes uh congratulations you</p>
<p>graduated as</p>
<p>a chiropractor congratulations hey why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you want to become a real doctor</p>
<p>so you have people that are bringing you</p>
<p>up and people are bringing you down</p>
<p>right so those people they bring you</p>
<p>down covertly</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re very introverting they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll do something like this</p>
<p>are you feeling okay you look really</p>
<p>tired are you sick</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like i was fine until you</p>
<p>said that</p>
<p>so i do have a way of getting back at</p>
<p>these people if you&rsquo;d like</p>
<p>to know about that anyone want to know</p>
<p>the technique</p>
<p>okay just reverse the flow just do back</p>
<p>to them</p>
<p>have you has that been growing for a</p>
<p>while</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have anything in your face</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll be in the bathroom for hours</p>
<p>looking at their face going is there</p>
<p>anything on here</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re introverting you so yeah</p>
<p>okay so let&rsquo;s move on to something less</p>
<p>stressful</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re in a relationship like</p>
<p>that or someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>connected and you&rsquo;re trying to reason</p>
<p>with them don&rsquo;t hold your breath</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t reason with them that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>frustrates you because you just want to</p>
<p>get them to see</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t you see that you&rsquo;re crazy no</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not going to see that</p>
<p>they have to be right they&rsquo;d rather be</p>
<p>right than successful</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re just better off just ignoring</p>
<p>them okay</p>
<p>so adrenal when the adrenal gland gets</p>
<p>burnt out your tolerance or stress goes</p>
<p>down you don&rsquo;t tolerate people anymore</p>
<p>people get on your nerves you become</p>
<p>edgy</p>
<p>especially incompetent people</p>
<p>people that make mistakes you kind of</p>
<p>like you might react more than you</p>
<p>should right</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going crazy okay it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>adrenals because the tolerance</p>
<p>of stress your ability to tolerate</p>
<p>stress stuff this</p>
<p>kind of buffers it so sometimes that</p>
<p>buffer goes down and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just kind of on edge all the</p>
<p>time um</p>
<p>the way you think it&rsquo;s not linear it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like popcorn thoughts just come in there</p>
<p>like this</p>
<p>your memory starts the adrenal affects</p>
<p>the gps in the brain</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s kind of like you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>downstairs you&rsquo;re like um</p>
<p>what am i looking for again i&rsquo;ve got to</p>
<p>backtrack</p>
<p>okay um you&rsquo;ll be talking to someone but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>having another conversation in your head</p>
<p>you might be waiting for the person to</p>
<p>stop talking so you can talk</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re kind of thinking too fast</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going too fast</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing you&rsquo;re solving</p>
<p>problems 24 7 you can&rsquo;t stop</p>
<p>solving problems in fact you can&rsquo;t stop</p>
<p>thinking so with adrenal</p>
<p>they do a lot of thinking and because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in a survival mode</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called flight or fight mode that is</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>the problem with that is it stirs up the</p>
<p>adrenals even more</p>
<p>what they should be doing is just turn</p>
<p>it off for at least</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know like a half hour a day go</p>
<p>for a walk</p>
<p>look at a tree a bird a cloud and just</p>
<p>get space don&rsquo;t get the headphones on</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>you know look at your computer all the</p>
<p>time how many of you sit in front of a</p>
<p>computer more than uh</p>
<p>five hours a day 16 hours a day</p>
<p>wow um that what happens is that</p>
<p>it really kind of the computers and</p>
<p>everything kind of will stress your body</p>
<p>too especially if you have the computer</p>
<p>right next to your body i would try to</p>
<p>get as far away as possible</p>
<p>and even when you go to sleep at night</p>
<p>make sure there&rsquo;s no electrical stuff</p>
<p>right by your head</p>
<p>you got cell phones you know all that</p>
<p>stuff i i&rsquo;m very</p>
<p>sensitive to um energies and i can pick</p>
<p>up like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t like talking in that cell phone</p>
<p>somehow it just like feels like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a microwave in my brain</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m like okay i gotta go you know</p>
<p>just that&rsquo;s why everyone&rsquo;s like what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your cell phone number</p>
<p>i never pick it up because i don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>that cell phone</p>
<p>so the adrenal when the adrenal gets</p>
<p>stressed</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t tolerate stress and you start</p>
<p>increasing hormones that are going to</p>
<p>cause belly fat all right so this is an</p>
<p>adrenal body type shape right here</p>
<p>the weight is right there now why is it</p>
<p>in the belly</p>
<p>primarily because your body&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>survival and as a stress mechanism</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to hold it around the most</p>
<p>important organs which happen to be in</p>
<p>your midsection</p>
<p>your body&rsquo;s trying to survive it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>trying to help you it&rsquo;s protecting you</p>
<p>against starvation</p>
<p>that low calorie diet that you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to go on yeah so it&rsquo;s like going to put</p>
<p>it right here</p>
<p>how many sit ups will it take to flatten</p>
<p>that belly</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to happen why because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s coming from a hormone</p>
<p>your problem is not your weight it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your hormones</p>
<p>you have to reduce that cortisol the</p>
<p>things that people do</p>
<p>to lose weight end up destroying their</p>
<p>metabolism and their hormones we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to jack that</p>
<p>up anymore so people take stimulants</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re already stimulated you don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to jack it up more</p>
<p>so it goes there now over time instead</p>
<p>of burning the belly fat off as energy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to burn off your leg muscles</p>
<p>before it even touches that fat</p>
<p>in other words your body is going to use</p>
<p>up your proteins and your your thighs</p>
<p>so guess what that&rsquo;s connected to your</p>
<p>knees that&rsquo;s why you have a lot of knee</p>
<p>problems with</p>
<p>with adrenal and you have a lot of</p>
<p>collagen because all the glue that holds</p>
<p>the body together falls apart so you</p>
<p>have</p>
<p>loose skin it&rsquo;s called pendulous abdomen</p>
<p>it kind of sags right here</p>
<p>and when you get it from a seated</p>
<p>position you&rsquo;re kind of like</p>
<p>getting up climbing is a problem your</p>
<p>legs are heavier</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry it gets worse so after these</p>
<p>legs become dissolved</p>
<p>then your adrenals will go after another</p>
<p>muscle called the glutamus</p>
<p>maximus what muscle is that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>behind</p>
<p>so so what happens is not only do we get</p>
<p>us</p>
<p>thinner legs and bigger trunk but we get</p>
<p>no butt</p>
<p>so you got no butt no legs all belly</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve seen people like that right so</p>
<p>you have something to look forward to</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just gonna</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m telling you you gotta you have to um</p>
<p>you gotta start now</p>
<p>just preventing okay um i&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>relatives</p>
<p>that before menopause oh my goodness</p>
<p>waste like this after</p>
<p>like that so yeah</p>
<p>so adrenal glands will cause all sorts</p>
<p>of problems with stress responses</p>
<p>and it affects their ability to</p>
<p>sleep normally when you go to sleep at</p>
<p>night you&rsquo;re supposed to go through</p>
<p>four waves of sleep</p>
<p>from a light sleep here to a deep sleep</p>
<p>here</p>
<p>now down here</p>
<p>in the lower parts this is called the</p>
<p>delta</p>
<p>wave sleep right here that&rsquo;s where you</p>
<p>burn</p>
<p>98 of all your fat not during</p>
<p>the day all the fat burning occurs</p>
<p>right there if you&rsquo;re not sleeping</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to burn fat but in your</p>
<p>mind you&rsquo;re thinking you&rsquo;re wasting your</p>
<p>time i should be walking while i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sleeping</p>
<p>just to burn off those calories so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>talk about calories for a second</p>
<p>yes exercise does burn calories</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true but not necessarily fat</p>
<p>calories</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take a look at something when a</p>
<p>normal person exercises</p>
<p>they actually stress their body out okay</p>
<p>sounds pretty interesting but what all</p>
<p>the benefit</p>
<p>from that exercise occurs in the</p>
<p>recovery 14 hours</p>
<p>just 24 hours later when you&rsquo;re in the</p>
<p>deep</p>
<p>sleep if you&rsquo;re sleeping if you let</p>
<p>yourself recover</p>
<p>you ever hear that workout called the</p>
<p>p90x or the insanity workout</p>
<p>i normally see people like 45 they start</p>
<p>doing that</p>
<p>you ever see the videos they have like</p>
<p>18 year olds</p>
<p>if you have low recovery like low</p>
<p>endurance low fitness</p>
<p>and you do that something that hot</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to hurt yourself you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to pull a hamstring</p>
<p>i see it all the time my son i took him</p>
<p>to wrestling practice</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like 16 17.</p>
<p>i was wrestling in college we go there</p>
<p>and all the fathers are</p>
<p>around the mat they&rsquo;re standing around</p>
<p>the perimeter with their shoes off with</p>
<p>their socks on</p>
<p>waiting to jump in there because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in their mind they&rsquo;re still 18.</p>
<p>one guy breaks the rib this guy you know</p>
<p>he runs out of almost like had a heart</p>
<p>attack</p>
<p>it was hilarious so mentally</p>
<p>you might still be 18 physically you may</p>
<p>not be</p>
<p>quite that level so it really all the</p>
<p>benefit occurs in the recovery after the</p>
<p>workout</p>
<p>so when you exercise you stress your</p>
<p>body and then you&rsquo;re supposed to recover</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when you burn the fat not</p>
<p>during the workout</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t believe me go work out</p>
<p>three hours and</p>
<p>weigh yourself before and after you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>burn 900 calories</p>
<p>but no actual weight loss</p>
<p>okay so it&rsquo;s all right here if</p>
<p>you can recover adrenal cases</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t recover that well so they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>adapt</p>
<p>so the exercise only as good as if you</p>
<p>can</p>
<p>change or adapt to it so that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re dealing with is how do you</p>
<p>get your body to change</p>
<p>from the things you&rsquo;re doing it how many</p>
<p>found when you&rsquo;re 18 you can pretty much</p>
<p>eat anything you want</p>
<p>and really you can just get away with it</p>
<p>right how many find you can&rsquo;t quite get</p>
<p>away with it now</p>
<p>what is the difference the difference is</p>
<p>your metabolism the rate</p>
<p>your metabolism okay that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s broken</p>
<p>you really have to exercise based on</p>
<p>your ability to recover</p>
<p>from it it&rsquo;s better off for adrenals if</p>
<p>you go walking on a flat surface</p>
<p>than to get on that treadmill to burn</p>
<p>off the calories so the thing that</p>
<p>people do</p>
<p>cut calories starvation exhaustive</p>
<p>exercise is the exact thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>keeping that weight there and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>frustrated because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been taught that oh everyone</p>
<p>knows</p>
<p>that you just have to exercise in diet</p>
<p>oh really</p>
<p>well those people are saying that i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never probably worked with</p>
<p>one person i bet i&rsquo;ve been there in the</p>
<p>field of weight loss for 25 years i</p>
<p>worked on 35 000 different people</p>
<p>i believe a patient because i observe</p>
<p>them</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re eating good and it&rsquo;s still not</p>
<p>working they&rsquo;re doing the treadmill it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still not working so it really has to do</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>the internal so we want to adjust the</p>
<p>workout</p>
<p>to your ability to adapt that&rsquo;s why you</p>
<p>have to</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t put everyone in the same</p>
<p>program everyone needs their their own</p>
<p>program</p>
<p>so with adrenaline they can&rsquo;t get to</p>
<p>sleep because they&rsquo;re so wound up and</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t relax</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re thinking so much or they</p>
<p>get up in the middle of the night like</p>
<p>two and just like they&rsquo;re more awake at</p>
<p>two than they are</p>
<p>during the day in fact right after lunch</p>
<p>or three o&rsquo;clock they&rsquo;re just ready to</p>
<p>go to sleep so</p>
<p>either they can&rsquo;t get to sleep you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>stay sleep or the bladder</p>
<p>which actually is controlled by the</p>
<p>adrenal has to</p>
<p>eliminate you know so they&rsquo;re getting up</p>
<p>urinating several times a night that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>adrenal</p>
<p>the best sleep for the adrenal is a half</p>
<p>hour before the alarm clock goes off</p>
<p>right there</p>
<p>right when you finally get to sleep</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you got to get out</p>
<p>can anyone relate to that yeah don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worry it gets worse</p>
<p>um so we got the adrenal will affect the</p>
<p>sleep</p>
<p>create an inability to see change from a</p>
<p>workout</p>
<p>and it also will affect</p>
<p>your cognitive it affects a lot of other</p>
<p>things as well</p>
<p>it affects blood pressure yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the symptoms from the</p>
<p>adrenal is high blood pressure</p>
<p>especially of the top number the</p>
<p>systolic before the diastolic so always</p>
<p>look at the top number if the</p>
<p>top number is high we know it&rsquo;s adrenal</p>
<p>so because your body&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you lost that recovery mechanism to kind</p>
<p>of keep the pressure down</p>
<p>so you have blood pressure we have blood</p>
<p>sugar</p>
<p>yes diabetes is a symptom of adrenal</p>
<p>because they control the sugars</p>
<p>blood cholesterol is adrenal</p>
<p>yeah cholesterol is needed to make</p>
<p>adrenal hormones during stress the more</p>
<p>stress you go through</p>
<p>the more cholesterol you need to be able</p>
<p>to build those hormones</p>
<p>and then you have all allergies are</p>
<p>adrenal</p>
<p>including the sinus low vitamin d levels</p>
<p>are are adrenal you you know your doctor</p>
<p>saying go take vitamin d you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>deficient</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not asking why okay</p>
<p>arthritis all the itis in fact anything</p>
<p>connected with inflammation</p>
<p>is adrenal poor handwriting</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s me um i could write the first</p>
<p>part of the</p>
<p>the word but the last just kind of gets</p>
<p>all lost</p>
<p>so what this means blood pressure blood</p>
<p>sugar blood cholesterol allergies</p>
<p>vitamin d</p>
<p>inflammation and cognitive</p>
<p>issues insomnia other than that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>perfectly healthy</p>
<p>now here is the problem</p>
<p>what happens is that the medical system</p>
<p>treats treats these they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>ask why there&rsquo;s no evaluation</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;ll do is take that symptom</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>these are symptoms this is what symptom</p>
<p>is and then they make it the problem</p>
<p>okay they confuse the symptom with the</p>
<p>problem</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like one of those obvious things</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like is it just me why is anyone</p>
<p>asking this question</p>
<p>because if you ask your doctor what</p>
<p>caused this what they&rsquo;ll do is convert</p>
<p>it to a very scientific complex name</p>
<p>okay you have lumbalgia what does that</p>
<p>mean</p>
<p>low back pain oh okay you have</p>
<p>fibromyalgia</p>
<p>what does that mean you got you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>hurting all over your body</p>
<p>uh you have plantar fasciitis what does</p>
<p>that mean you got pain in the foot</p>
<p>you have dystatokinesis sounds pretty</p>
<p>scientific that means you can&rsquo;t do this</p>
<p>with your body you can&rsquo;t rotate it back</p>
<p>and forth</p>
<p>you have spondylothesis what does that</p>
<p>mean you have a you have a broken back</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all these labels post traumatic</p>
<p>stress syndrome you means you you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>some stress in your past</p>
<p>they have one now called non-compliance</p>
<p>to treatment disorder</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m serious i&rsquo;m not kidding</p>
<p>non-compliance to treatment disorder</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t do what the doctor says</p>
<p>i told my son that and he said oh homie</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t play that i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>i said i said what does homie don&rsquo;t play</p>
<p>that mean he said</p>
<p>that means um i&rsquo;m not going to do what</p>
<p>you say</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like oh okay then you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>get a diagnosis from the doctor</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s going to go you have</p>
<p>non-compliance treatment disorder</p>
<p>well maybe you didn&rsquo;t want the surgery</p>
<p>maybe you want a second opinion and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll put this label</p>
<p>they have a manic depressive what does</p>
<p>that mean it means that you&rsquo;re happy and</p>
<p>sad</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s wrong with being happy you know</p>
<p>you have a clinical depression</p>
<p>it could mean that you&rsquo;re not sleeping</p>
<p>people that don&rsquo;t sleep get depressed</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s just amazing and then it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>treated</p>
<p>with a poison i&rsquo;m sorry a medication</p>
<p>my whole thought is that what&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>missing in healthcare</p>
<p>is the health part it&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>i mean i don&rsquo;t know sometimes i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>did i just think of that is that</p>
<p>original idea or does everyone know that</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s bizarre there&rsquo;s no health</p>
<p>and health care it&rsquo;s all disease care</p>
<p>there are underlying principles to all</p>
<p>subjects in life that are very high</p>
<p>principles that everything kind of must</p>
<p>revolve around</p>
<p>okay my whole principle in weight loss</p>
<p>is getting healthy lose weight</p>
<p>not losing weight to get healthy you</p>
<p>have to focus on your health</p>
<p>now that&rsquo;s pretty powerful because if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know that you&rsquo;re very</p>
<p>susceptible to the next</p>
<p>unhealthy diet that comes along or a</p>
<p>little gimmick that</p>
<p>might not be healthy but if you look at</p>
<p>it from the viewpoint of</p>
<p>okay is that healthy yes okay that might</p>
<p>work</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just take the word food</p>
<p>how many of you eat food okay yeah</p>
<p>how many of you never looked up the</p>
<p>definition of the word food before</p>
<p>okay i&rsquo;m going to tell you what it is is</p>
<p>that which is eating sustained life</p>
<p>provide energy and promote the growth</p>
<p>and repair of tissue</p>
<p>it comes from the latin word which means</p>
<p>nourishment</p>
<p>nutrients so food is nutrients that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why we</p>
<p>supposed to eat it we&rsquo;re not supposed to</p>
<p>eat food for necessarily anything other</p>
<p>than health and nutrients</p>
<p>but so when you go into the grocery</p>
<p>store you can ask now</p>
<p>what am i in the mood for no no don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>ask that because you&rsquo;re going to get a</p>
<p>brownie</p>
<p>but if you say what can get me more</p>
<p>nutrition what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what can i eat that has more nutrition</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very powerful because then you</p>
<p>get to stay out of trouble</p>
<p>i guarantee all the junk foods don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a lot of nutrition they don&rsquo;t other</p>
<p>than synthetic vitamins</p>
<p>in politics you have underlying</p>
<p>principles that you use</p>
<p>like the i guess the principle in</p>
<p>politics or the underlying</p>
<p>senior principle would be something like</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t spend more than you have</p>
<p>right in the budget would that be kind</p>
<p>of a smart thing get out of trouble</p>
<p>so i guess we have to worry about that</p>
<p>one just being sarcastic</p>
<p>um and then you have um what about in um</p>
<p>in the area of health in general you</p>
<p>have to</p>
<p>or health care you have to create your</p>
<p>health</p>
<p>can you imagine if we just put</p>
<p>one percent of the of the money we put</p>
<p>in sick care or health care into just</p>
<p>prevention or</p>
<p>creating health it&rsquo;s over it&rsquo;s over i</p>
<p>mean</p>
<p>prevention the problem is the doctors</p>
<p>will say okay let&rsquo;s check in six months</p>
<p>okay and you keep coming back let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>check you let&rsquo;s check you</p>
<p>sorry to tell this you have cancer get</p>
<p>your stuff together</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s we&rsquo;re going to do chemo what</p>
<p>was to be done to prevent it what was</p>
<p>done to create the health</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing what are they going to</p>
<p>do an aspirin a day</p>
<p>i had to get life insurance okay at</p>
<p>least i&rsquo;m still trying to figure out why</p>
<p>my wife wanted to get life insurance</p>
<p>so i go to the doctor my cholesterol is</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>180 it&rsquo;s pretty good doctor says well</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s normal but we&rsquo;re going to prevent</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to we&rsquo;re going to practice</p>
<p>some preventative medication</p>
<p>like what what do you talk about</p>
<p>ceremony because i know what we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>doing on everyone right now</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like no thank you no it&rsquo;s because no</p>
<p>no i have a free sample</p>
<p>lipitor i&rsquo;m like no that is side effects</p>
<p>because oh no that&rsquo;s you can&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>the articles you can&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like you&rsquo;re gonna kick back</p>
<p>so the point is that there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>corruption in the area of</p>
<p>pharmaceuticals and drugs you already</p>
<p>know that</p>
<p>but the point is that you have to start</p>
<p>creating your health</p>
<p>because the doctors just don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>i train doctors i train over 2 400</p>
<p>doctors</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not taught how to get someone</p>
<p>healthy other than the food pyramid</p>
<p>drink more water eat more fiber you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like it&rsquo;s not significant</p>
<p>so you really have to learn how to</p>
<p>create health yourself</p>
<p>and start building your health because</p>
<p>no one else is going to do it for you</p>
<p>cancer takes 20 years to grow in your</p>
<p>body</p>
<p>i mean all of you probably have some</p>
<p>cancer cells in your body it&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing in your environment that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>countering that right now to protect you</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>literally you have to create your health</p>
<p>every day</p>
<p>so i look at people a little differently</p>
<p>like what i&rsquo;ll do when i&rsquo;m listening to</p>
<p>people</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll just dissect them in half and i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>go okay what are the things they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing to create their health</p>
<p>and what are the things they&rsquo;re doing to</p>
<p>counter create their health because</p>
<p>doing nothing is counter-creating right</p>
<p>so and it&rsquo;s amazing it makes it so</p>
<p>simple</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like wow like wow look at this</p>
<p>like you don&rsquo;t have you don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>many people don&rsquo;t realize that the</p>
<p>cravings</p>
<p>are a very simple nutrient deficiency</p>
<p>potassium</p>
<p>when you have low potassium you will</p>
<p>crave</p>
<p>sugar guaranteed when you get your daily</p>
<p>amount of potassium you will not crave</p>
<p>sugar it&rsquo;s that simple</p>
<p>how many have craved sugar okay if i</p>
<p>tell you what to do</p>
<p>would you would you do it to get rid of</p>
<p>cravings within 24 hours or actually 48</p>
<p>hours</p>
<p>okay so do this thing right here normal</p>
<p>amount of potassium we need is 4 700</p>
<p>milligrams a day</p>
<p>now what food are is high in potassium</p>
<p>bananas right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s 400 okay how many bananas would</p>
<p>it take</p>
<p>12 12 bananas right</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re not going to do 12 bananas</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>so the amount of potassium you need is</p>
<p>so high</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even realize it there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of potassium so what you can do</p>
<p>is you can have all the leafy greens you</p>
<p>would need seven cups</p>
<p>to seven cups it&rsquo;s not hard couple</p>
<p>salads a day</p>
<p>and you will fulfill your daily amount</p>
<p>requirement for potassium</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t you will not have cravings</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s wonderful to help protect against</p>
<p>diabetes</p>
<p>this right here because when you have</p>
<p>that potassium it helps stabilize your</p>
<p>blood sugars</p>
<p>but how many of you really don&rsquo;t consume</p>
<p>seven cups of salad a day</p>
<p>hardly anyone does how the heck are you</p>
<p>ever going to get your potassium</p>
<p>so um this is the problem is we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really know what foods have the right</p>
<p>nutrients</p>
<p>and and the soils are so depleted if you</p>
<p>would if you wanted to get</p>
<p>your basic nutrients of trace minerals</p>
<p>okay those are little minerals that you</p>
<p>need in small amounts</p>
<p>in your food right now with the soils</p>
<p>the way they are</p>
<p>you would have to consume 27</p>
<p>000 calories of food</p>
<p>yeah so that&rsquo;s going to be pretty hard</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it that&rsquo;s a lot of food eating</p>
<p>every day</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re going to have to subs or</p>
<p>enhance your diet with something</p>
<p>just make sure it&rsquo;s the right nutrients</p>
<p>plant-based you have to concentrate</p>
<p>but yeah that&rsquo;s this is the problem is</p>
<p>that people don&rsquo;t know how to create</p>
<p>health</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s kind of crazy</p>
<p>so so we have the adrenal we have uh</p>
<p>with the problem with the adrenal is you</p>
<p>get fluid retention because all the</p>
<p>electrolytes are controlled</p>
<p>the sodium potassium is controlled by</p>
<p>the adrenal in other words when you have</p>
<p>adrenal problems you lose potassium</p>
<p>your salts and electro all these things</p>
<p>that keep the fluid</p>
<p>moving are gone so the fluid is going to</p>
<p>pull in your ankles</p>
<p>when you press your ankle and leaves a</p>
<p>little dent that&rsquo;s fluid retention</p>
<p>you shouldn&rsquo;t have that okay go ahead</p>
<p>and press your ankle and see if you have</p>
<p>any</p>
<p>indentations there</p>
<p>can you call 9-1-1 so fluid</p>
<p>in the ankles is purely an electrolyte</p>
<p>problem because the adrenal it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>backing up fluid so we have that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have salt cravings for adrenal</p>
<p>too</p>
<p>salt cravings that&rsquo;s adrenal salt is the</p>
<p>is the mineral that recharges the</p>
<p>battery that&rsquo;s why you need a little</p>
<p>chip at night when you go home</p>
<p>i mean just to recharge your battery</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re drained</p>
<p>most of you are like a car in the</p>
<p>freeway the battery is dead and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>putting gas in the car</p>
<p>why doesn&rsquo;t this thing start now you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pushing the car it&rsquo;s getting kind of</p>
<p>heavy</p>
<p>so electrolytes fluid now how much water</p>
<p>should you drink</p>
<p>eight classes right who told you that</p>
<p>they told you someday</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to find out who they is</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>that is a myth i was taught that you</p>
<p>drink</p>
<p>i still can&rsquo;t find the uh where do you</p>
<p>find this information</p>
<p>only drink when you&rsquo;re thirsty here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what i found the more water you drink</p>
<p>the more dehydrated you become</p>
<p>why because it flushes out the</p>
<p>electrolytes that are supposed to hold</p>
<p>the water</p>
<p>there there&rsquo;s a condition right now that</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s called um hyponutremia</p>
<p>which is actually too much water which</p>
<p>is flushing electrolytes and you can die</p>
<p>die by drinking too much water so</p>
<p>drink when you&rsquo;re thirsty i have a</p>
<p>machine i measure fluid in</p>
<p>a person&rsquo;s body normally people that</p>
<p>drink the most water the most dehydrated</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry it gets worse so</p>
<p>they is everywhere it&rsquo;s nowhere it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like i don&rsquo;t know who they is</p>
<p>so you have fluids we have calcium</p>
<p>calcium is controlled by the adrenal</p>
<p>not just bone loss not just muscle</p>
<p>cramps</p>
<p>but you need calcium to have to wind</p>
<p>down at night</p>
<p>without good adrenals your calcium will</p>
<p>deposit</p>
<p>not in the bone but on the bone as</p>
<p>arthritis bursitis tendinitis</p>
<p>tartar in your teeth cataracts kidney</p>
<p>stones</p>
<p>gallstones bursitis all the itis and</p>
<p>twitching in the left eyelid right here</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s calcium so again what do</p>
<p>people take</p>
<p>calcium carbonate limestone it&rsquo;s in the</p>
<p>one a days</p>
<p>any time you get a vitamin that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>prescribed prescription</p>
<p>at a pharmacy oh my goodness that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>how low can you go it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>way off the deep end it&rsquo;s just going to</p>
<p>be rocks</p>
<p>you need plant-based minerals this is</p>
<p>how it works</p>
<p>the plant is supposed to break down the</p>
<p>minerals like rocks in the earth</p>
<p>and absorb them into the plant and make</p>
<p>them easy to digest</p>
<p>the plant-based minerals are 10</p>
<p>000 times smaller than rocks and</p>
<p>metallic minerals that you get like sea</p>
<p>salts</p>
<p>ten thousand times smaller so that would</p>
<p>be the equivalent to a</p>
<p>um a golf ball to the empire state</p>
<p>building</p>
<p>so you absorb these plant-based minerals</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>much better you ever find that when you</p>
<p>eat food you don&rsquo;t feel satisfied like</p>
<p>it just doesn&rsquo;t quite</p>
<p>even water just doesn&rsquo;t satisfy you</p>
<p>because the nutrients aren&rsquo;t there why</p>
<p>do you think you keep craving</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s a deficiency so we</p>
<p>have</p>
<p>sinus problems oh that&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>diagnosis sleep apnea what does that</p>
<p>mean it means that your sinuses are</p>
<p>blocked</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like very i mean it&rsquo;s just amazing</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s gotten out of control</p>
<p>and so right now the answer to</p>
<p>healthcare is not spending more</p>
<p>money on it it&rsquo;s just to do more</p>
<p>prevention the whole philosophy is</p>
<p>broken</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no money in prevention it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>too cheap</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s very cheap in fact i can</p>
<p>take</p>
<p>every one of your grocery bills and</p>
<p>probably find</p>
<p>a hundred dollars every two weeks of a</p>
<p>food that you could just switch over to</p>
<p>healthier food</p>
<p>and just and just take that and create</p>
<p>health it&rsquo;s not that hard it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>choices what to eat</p>
<p>in the grocery store why do i know this</p>
<p>because i go in the grocery store and i</p>
<p>see what they have</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so bad it&rsquo;s amazing like wow people</p>
<p>must be buying that</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s there i mean trying to find</p>
<p>food in the grocery store it&rsquo;s not easy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like um so we have adrenal any</p>
<p>other question about the adrenal</p>
<p>body type it&rsquo;s kind of an interesting</p>
<p>type snoring because the sinuses</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a nerve that goes in the back of</p>
<p>the sinuses that if</p>
<p>the adrenal gland shrinks it because the</p>
<p>cortisol and it actually makes us</p>
<p>thicker so you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>you know snoring so we have</p>
<p>adrenal now um the other thing is that</p>
<p>of course my wife says that sometimes</p>
<p>i make that sound i&rsquo;m like no i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>she goes okay i&rsquo;m gonna record you i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like okay you can prove it so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s adrenal</p>
<p>now the next body type is the ov ovary</p>
<p>body type</p>
<p>this is it right here see this body type</p>
<p>look where they gain the weight lower</p>
<p>part in the hips</p>
<p>thighs that&rsquo;s estrogen dominance take a</p>
<p>while to guess why you don&rsquo;t see very</p>
<p>many men that look</p>
<p>like that they don&rsquo;t have ovaries very</p>
<p>good</p>
<p>so the ovary will out produce too much</p>
<p>estrogen the estrogen makes</p>
<p>fat around the superficial from here</p>
<p>down it will also make your arms get big</p>
<p>and the breasts get big i had one</p>
<p>patient she was so estrogen dominant she</p>
<p>became a size</p>
<p>h i didn&rsquo;t even know it goes that high</p>
<p>i thought d double triple d was the</p>
<p>highest</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see a b c d e f g h</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s estrogen dominance how do</p>
<p>you know if you&rsquo;re estrogen dominant</p>
<p>if you look like that and also you have</p>
<p>heavy periods</p>
<p>cramping pms all that guess what that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to do</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to make a fibroid i see so</p>
<p>many women with fibroids</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s estrogen dominance so what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>solution</p>
<p>cut it out i mean they&rsquo;re not doing</p>
<p>anything there are foods that you can</p>
<p>eat right now that will balance estrogen</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called the cruciferous vegetable</p>
<p>cruciferous vegetables are like kale</p>
<p>broccoli brussels sprouts cabbage</p>
<p>all the foods that no one eats those are</p>
<p>very estrogen</p>
<p>they clean up the estrogen they balance</p>
<p>it and the chemicals</p>
<p>thank goodness we have those foods in</p>
<p>our diet um</p>
<p>if we ever eat them but mainly people</p>
<p>cook the heck out of them don&rsquo;t they</p>
<p>yeah so</p>
<p>um estrogen dominant will cause anything</p>
<p>wrong with this cycle</p>
<p>heavy periods headaches that time of the</p>
<p>month uh cravings that time of the month</p>
<p>um pms how many of you know people that</p>
<p>are pms</p>
<p>okay i can see the husbands are not like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>so you have all these different issues</p>
<p>that happen that time of the month if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s cyclic</p>
<p>because the hormones go on waves just</p>
<p>like all these circadian waves</p>
<p>um fertility infertility because</p>
<p>estrogen you know what&rsquo;s really amazing</p>
<p>things</p>
<p>you have this estrogen dominant patient</p>
<p>and guess what they give them</p>
<p>birth control pills it&rsquo;s the exact</p>
<p>opposite thing</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to put it more in estrogen</p>
<p>dominance</p>
<p>what foods should they stay away from</p>
<p>soy</p>
<p>why because soy is very estrogenic</p>
<p>and the soy that&rsquo;s in america is not the</p>
<p>same that&rsquo;s another place it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>fermented it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just soy powder it&rsquo;s soy protein</p>
<p>isolates what does that do</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to grow tumors in your liver</p>
<p>and your um in your um</p>
<p>where else in the ovaries in the uterus</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll grow tumors it&rsquo;s very tumor</p>
<p>producing</p>
<p>yeah i see it all the time there were</p>
<p>even some men that came in they were</p>
<p>drinking so much soy milk they started</p>
<p>lactating that was enough for me to cut</p>
<p>it completely out of the diet</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s estrogen is very very um</p>
<p>bad for the liver and um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s every it&rsquo;s in almost a lot it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>a lot of foods isn&rsquo;t it it&rsquo;s genetically</p>
<p>modified</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost 100 genetically modified in</p>
<p>the us and that means they alter the</p>
<p>structure so there&rsquo;s a lot of unknowns</p>
<p>right now there&rsquo;s no studies so um you</p>
<p>know it doesn&rsquo;t have to be on the label</p>
<p>too to be genetically modified</p>
<p>they could just stick it in there so you</p>
<p>have soy it&rsquo;s in also in a lot of</p>
<p>prepackaged foods a lot of diets</p>
<p>yeah isn&rsquo;t that interesting the stuff</p>
<p>that causes estrogen is in these eyes</p>
<p>why do they use it because it&rsquo;s so cheap</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so cheap i made a kale shake</p>
<p>with um i was going to put some protein</p>
<p>and the guy that was helping me develop</p>
<p>the formula says oh you got to put some</p>
<p>soy and it&rsquo;s really cheap</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like i&rsquo;m not going to put that in</p>
<p>there that&rsquo;s going to like kill people</p>
<p>so i put um spirulina</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like a veg vegeta a vegetable um</p>
<p>a sea vegetable so it has some egg white</p>
<p>organic egg white and kale</p>
<p>but the point is that you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>do a lot of estrogen</p>
<p>with that because then you want to make</p>
<p>sure if they&rsquo;re doing meats and dairy</p>
<p>they have organic hormone free</p>
<p>this body type craves</p>
<p>dairy they like ice cream cheese</p>
<p>yogurt it&rsquo;s wow they&rsquo;re trying to get</p>
<p>some hormones in there to try to balance</p>
<p>something because they&rsquo;re out of balance</p>
<p>it won&rsquo;t ever work though so they have a</p>
<p>lot of issues with that</p>
<p>and then when they get to be age 52</p>
<p>the ovaries stop working</p>
<p>okay but guess what you have a backup</p>
<p>organ here&rsquo;s the ovaries</p>
<p>the adrenals are little triangles on top</p>
<p>of the kidney</p>
<p>these start doing the work so now if the</p>
<p>adrenal glands are weak going in the</p>
<p>menopause</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to overload those things</p>
<p>and now this is going to do all the work</p>
<p>and so now you&rsquo;re going to have all</p>
<p>sorts of problems with</p>
<p>hot flash flashes night sweats</p>
<p>okay does anyone have a hot flash okay</p>
<p>so hot flashes are basically</p>
<p>a short circuit in the electrical system</p>
<p>of your body</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just kind of like it&rsquo;s blowing</p>
<p>that heat right there someone&rsquo;s having a</p>
<p>hot flash right now</p>
<p>um so that would be hot flashes</p>
<p>so this body type ends up looking like</p>
<p>this body type after menopause so what</p>
<p>am i trying to tell you i&rsquo;m trying to</p>
<p>give you a clue</p>
<p>that you better do something now before</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too late</p>
<p>now some of you in your mind you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking wow i&rsquo;m a mixed body type</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m everything right you always have a</p>
<p>primary</p>
<p>too much estrogen will block the thyroid</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why when you get pregnant you</p>
<p>might end up with a thyroid problem</p>
<p>because the excess estrogen will block</p>
<p>this</p>
<p>and then create all sorts of problems</p>
<p>many many borderline thyroid cases need</p>
<p>to take thyroid medication when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pregnant because of the spike of</p>
<p>estrogen</p>
<p>so all these things work together</p>
<p>if the liver is bad which we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>get to</p>
<p>next your thyroid can&rsquo;t work the ear</p>
<p>thyroid needs</p>
<p>that liver to convert like 80 of all the</p>
<p>activation of that hormone curse with</p>
<p>your liver</p>
<p>so i had a lady she came in she did the</p>
<p>wrong</p>
<p>diet for her body type she did the high</p>
<p>protein diet</p>
<p>okay she was a liver type liver types</p>
<p>should not do high protein diets okay</p>
<p>what happened she lost weight but she</p>
<p>also lost all of her hair</p>
<p>well she had two gray hairs uh she had a</p>
<p>wig a very nice wig</p>
<p>um and she came in and she said doctor</p>
<p>gotta help me i&rsquo;m like okay what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on</p>
<p>she goes look at i was like okay yes we</p>
<p>need to we need to work on that</p>
<p>so i said um what happened to you</p>
<p>she goes i just did this diet i lost all</p>
<p>my hair i said bingo</p>
<p>you mess with your liver and then the</p>
<p>block the thyroid</p>
<p>now here&rsquo;s the problem she was gonna she</p>
<p>was she was gonna get married okay</p>
<p>her husband future husband had no clue</p>
<p>she was completely</p>
<p>bald okay that&rsquo;s the situation wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like the honeymoon</p>
<p>night um</p>
<p>honey now that we&rsquo;re married um surprise</p>
<p>and then he pulls off his toupee</p>
<p>i think there was like a movie where you</p>
<p>can pull off your arm and your leg</p>
<p>so i worked on her i do a technique</p>
<p>which which works on old stress it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>acupressure not puncture and we worked</p>
<p>on her</p>
<p>and worked on the liver and she got her</p>
<p>hair back in three weeks tiny little</p>
<p>hair she came back she was real happy</p>
<p>got married never told them went great</p>
<p>yeah so these hormones have</p>
<p>dominating things dominating</p>
<p>power to do certain things</p>
<p>we when you actually age</p>
<p>when you go from 20s 30s 40s 50s okay</p>
<p>hormones change metabolism</p>
<p>slows down would you agree with that</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t keep doing the same thing</p>
<p>with the calorie counting you have to</p>
<p>look at</p>
<p>the hormones in relationship to the</p>
<p>triggering of the fat burning hormones</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to show you something before i</p>
<p>get to the next body type real fast</p>
<p>hormones there are three dominating</p>
<p>hormones that if present in small</p>
<p>amounts</p>
<p>will completely block and cancel all the</p>
<p>fat</p>
<p>burning hormones okay in other words</p>
<p>you have two things you have things that</p>
<p>you should avoid and you have things</p>
<p>that you should do</p>
<p>the things that you should avoid are</p>
<p>much much much much more important</p>
<p>than the things that you should do it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the little stuff okay</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s take this one the first one is</p>
<p>called insulin insulin is a hormone that</p>
<p>regulates sugar it decreases sugar it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>triggered by sugar so every time you eat</p>
<p>sugar</p>
<p>it spikes the insulin okay then you</p>
<p>become a diabetic and then sugar goes</p>
<p>high it doesn&rsquo;t go down so you have to</p>
<p>take</p>
<p>insulin in the presence of just a little</p>
<p>tiny bit of insulin</p>
<p>it can cancel out and completely destroy</p>
<p>all the good stuff that you did so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just make this real</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take a cookie 80 calories</p>
<p>you can walk that off in about a mile</p>
<p>but the sugar in that one cookie</p>
<p>will will block that burning for 72</p>
<p>hours if you have a slow metabolism</p>
<p>like most people do a half a glass of</p>
<p>orange juice</p>
<p>a glass of wine unless dr oz told you to</p>
<p>do it</p>
<p>which i&rsquo;m just being sarcastic because</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like wine is alcohol it&rsquo;s sugar it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to completely block you so we</p>
<p>got insulin right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the little stuff that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>really mess you up so we have to</p>
<p>we have to give you substitutes for the</p>
<p>thing you crave i already know</p>
<p>a habit is almost impossible to break so</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t want to take all the pleasure</p>
<p>away from you in life</p>
<p>we want to tweak it so there&rsquo;s things</p>
<p>you can eat</p>
<p>brownies for example that have no sugar</p>
<p>no flour</p>
<p>and you can eat those you just have to</p>
<p>know how to make them when we have the</p>
<p>recipes we give you</p>
<p>and you can actually have it in the</p>
<p>refrigerator and go for that</p>
<p>every night or when you when you like</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>number two cortisol</p>
<p>too much cortisol that&rsquo;s the stress</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to lose weight and that</p>
<p>how do you get rid of stress sleeping</p>
<p>walking i teach people to do an</p>
<p>acupressure technique which basically</p>
<p>pulls the stress out you do it before</p>
<p>bed and you just get into a good sleep</p>
<p>and it extracts the old stress so</p>
<p>cortisol will block</p>
<p>fat burning that&rsquo;s why you have like</p>
<p>when you have physical trauma and then</p>
<p>you have losses</p>
<p>loss of a loved one or a divorce</p>
<p>whatever that will hit the adrenal a</p>
<p>thousand times harder than a physical</p>
<p>trauma</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why you have people that like</p>
<p>after like this major event they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>like they never recover that&rsquo;s why you</p>
<p>get autoimmune diseases like</p>
<p>lupus and ms they all come after losses</p>
<p>okay so then we have the last hormone</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>makes you fat is called estrogen</p>
<p>remember all those hidden sources of</p>
<p>estrogen it&rsquo;s in the hormones</p>
<p>in europe people are thinner than</p>
<p>americans</p>
<p>in america we got girls going through</p>
<p>the menstrual cycle a lot earlier</p>
<p>larger breasts kids are fatter</p>
<p>you might say it&rsquo;s a lot of different</p>
<p>things but i think the hormones are</p>
<p>really messing us up</p>
<p>if you now you guys realize that turkeys</p>
<p>are fed hormones</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re bigger they&rsquo;re huge</p>
<p>right they can grow them fast</p>
<p>if you consume the turkey that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>injected with a hormone</p>
<p>is it possible that some of that residue</p>
<p>can get in your body</p>
<p>if it makes a turkey a butterball turkey</p>
<p>is it possible to make a butterball out</p>
<p>of you butterball turkey</p>
<p>welcome to america you&rsquo;re in the wrong</p>
<p>country at the wrong time</p>
<p>so some of these poor countries they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>really rich in nutrients</p>
<p>but they come here and they just get</p>
<p>that i see it all the time they moved to</p>
<p>america i&rsquo;m like you&rsquo;re doing fine so</p>
<p>you moved here</p>
<p>welcome to virginia so we have to eat</p>
<p>and understand how to fortify our</p>
<p>hormones okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really important so last body</p>
<p>type is called the liver body type</p>
<p>the liver is located right here the size</p>
<p>of a football</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s three and a half pounds put your</p>
<p>hand on your liver</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s on the right side the military</p>
<p>right over here</p>
<p>okay good your liver</p>
<p>is kind of an extra organ you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really need it i&rsquo;m just being sarcastic</p>
<p>the liver if if it becomes dysfunctional</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to start getting more of a</p>
<p>protruded</p>
<p>pot belly okay you ever see the guy in</p>
<p>the beach with a speedo</p>
<p>sorry to give that image but that&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of like a basketball belly</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard it&rsquo;s higher if you take your</p>
<p>hand on one side and tap it it&rsquo;ll create</p>
<p>a little ripple</p>
<p>why because most of it&rsquo;s fluid</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called ascites it&rsquo;s a fluid it</p>
<p>means fluid it&rsquo;s leak the liver is</p>
<p>leaking fluid into that sac right there</p>
<p>so how many sit-ups won&rsquo;t work sit-ups</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>their legs are skinny it&rsquo;s just right</p>
<p>there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just beer it&rsquo;s actually fluid</p>
<p>coming from destruction of the liver</p>
<p>the two foods that destroy the liver are</p>
<p>heavy</p>
<p>cooked proteins animal proteins</p>
<p>heavy cooked texas style steaks this</p>
<p>thick big ones every night before you go</p>
<p>to bed</p>
<p>deep fried food deep fried catfish will</p>
<p>do it too</p>
<p>just all that fat and meat will just</p>
<p>destroy the liver so the worse the liver</p>
<p>the more you can&rsquo;t tolerate the heavy</p>
<p>proteins the older you get</p>
<p>the less you can tolerate red meat so</p>
<p>what happens is that you want to adjust</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>food based on your weakness but the good</p>
<p>thing about the liver</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the only organ that can completely</p>
<p>regenerate a hundred percent</p>
<p>but the bad news is it takes three years</p>
<p>of eating a certain way</p>
<p>okay the liver is the hub of so many</p>
<p>things</p>
<p>the liver will cause a liver problem</p>
<p>will cause pain on the right side right</p>
<p>shoulder why is it on the right shoulder</p>
<p>the liver is on the right it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be swell up it&rsquo;s going to go right here</p>
<p>if you have a liver problem don&rsquo;t sleep</p>
<p>on your left side because it&rsquo;s too heavy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to compress the heart</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to feel uncomfortable</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll sleep on the right side</p>
<p>the liver will create little red spots</p>
<p>on your skin</p>
<p>little red dot skin psoriasis</p>
<p>eczema little liver spots itchy skin</p>
<p>hot feet white tongue that&rsquo;s a yeast</p>
<p>chronic halitosis that&rsquo;s bad breath</p>
<p>sometimes they usually talk to you very</p>
<p>close in front of your face</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know that they have bad</p>
<p>breath it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>really um they have a lot of digestive</p>
<p>bloating</p>
<p>okay now the liver</p>
<p>makes bile now there&rsquo;s a confusion about</p>
<p>bile some people think it&rsquo;s bowel</p>
<p>no no that&rsquo;s bowel bile b-i-l-e</p>
<p>bile helps it&rsquo;s like the detergent that</p>
<p>breaks down the grease</p>
<p>it helps you digest the fats and it</p>
<p>helps you absorb</p>
<p>the fat vitamins that cyber vitamins</p>
<p>vitamin a</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re deficient about mna you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have a hard time seeing at</p>
<p>night</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have sinus problems</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have dry skin</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have a little uh yellow</p>
<p>thing in your inside of your eye right</p>
<p>here a little</p>
<p>tag there there&rsquo;s a lot of issues with</p>
<p>vitamin a vitamin d you&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>problems with calcium</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have problems with seasonal</p>
<p>depression vitamin e you&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>problems with libido vitamin um let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see a</p>
<p>e d and k you&rsquo;re gonna have bruising</p>
<p>so you have a lot of other issues just</p>
<p>for me doing a bio how do you know if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have bile you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>bloat when you eat you&rsquo;re gonna get</p>
<p>bloating</p>
<p>burping belching headache on the right</p>
<p>side</p>
<p>98 percent of headaches and migraines</p>
<p>are coming from</p>
<p>that right there try and experiment</p>
<p>next time you get a headache press right</p>
<p>here</p>
<p>on your gallbladder just press right</p>
<p>there and just hold that for two minutes</p>
<p>your headache will go right away the</p>
<p>problem is not in your head</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in your down here because when you</p>
<p>step on a dog&rsquo;s tail he barks through</p>
<p>his mouth right</p>
<p>okay i&rsquo;m just checking so we get</p>
<p>bloating burping belching many people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have the bile</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re bloat when they like at</p>
<p>night they feel like they&rsquo;re pregnant</p>
<p>yet during the day they have flat</p>
<p>stomach</p>
<p>is that real to anyone okay so</p>
<p>the liver they they crave deep fried</p>
<p>catfish they like deep-fried anything</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not absorbing it</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re gonna want the stuff that you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t absorb the other symptom is that</p>
<p>when you eat you&rsquo;re gonna need a little</p>
<p>sweet after you eat</p>
<p>you need that little sweet because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not digesting fats to satisfy</p>
<p>your blood sugars</p>
<p>okay you&rsquo;re going to be grouchy in the</p>
<p>morning because you have a low blood</p>
<p>sugar in the morning</p>
<p>how many work with people that are</p>
<p>grouchy in the morning okay</p>
<p>so what you do on monday when you go</p>
<p>back to work just go up to</p>
<p>uh go up to the guy hey john listen</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;ve been holding a grudge on</p>
<p>you because you&rsquo;ve been very kind of</p>
<p>grouchy</p>
<p>but now i know it&rsquo;s just your liver i</p>
<p>forgive you</p>
<p>or the next time you go the all you eat</p>
<p>buffet</p>
<p>just go online excuse me sir</p>
<p>have you ever had your liver checked do</p>
<p>you have any right shoulder pain</p>
<p>do you ever itch in the bottom of your</p>
<p>feet let me see your tongue for a second</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s dr berg&rsquo;s card you might want to</p>
<p>give him a call do you get bloating by</p>
<p>the way</p>
<p>actually don&rsquo;t mention my name if you</p>
<p>say that um</p>
<p>they might get offended see the problem</p>
<p>with teaching you this seminar is you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to want to evaluate everyone you</p>
<p>know everywhere you go you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>spot oh</p>
<p>liver third two two two sorry</p>
<p>so that is liver um</p>
<p>liver is uh they do very well on</p>
<p>cruciferous vegetables okay</p>
<p>any other questions about the body types</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>i notice you have the man the male there</p>
<p>with the</p>
<p>liver and i know a male cannot have a</p>
<p>very ovary</p>
<p>what about the other what would it look</p>
<p>like to see a male</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s very rare so she asked question</p>
<p>why</p>
<p>what would it look like if there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>male with these other ones it&rsquo;s did</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very rare to have a primary thyroid</p>
<p>body type it&rsquo;s usually secondary to</p>
<p>having the thyroid removed because of</p>
<p>estrogen dominance</p>
<p>too much estrogen is underneath most of</p>
<p>the thyroids i mean it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>almost not</p>
<p>existent this is very common this this</p>
<p>adrenal right here just because of</p>
<p>stress that&rsquo;s probably the number one</p>
<p>thing</p>
<p>you see this because of just bad eating</p>
<p>from years</p>
<p>but the ovary is very common too so this</p>
<p>one here these three are very common</p>
<p>so if if that guy was</p>
<p>a thyroid they would just be big all</p>
<p>over</p>
<p>if that guy was adrenal he would have</p>
<p>more of a sagging belly it wouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>so high in the top</p>
<p>okay and of course he wouldn&rsquo;t have that</p>
<p>typically</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see he had a lot of soy milk</p>
<p>now this next thing i&rsquo;m going to tell</p>
<p>you is so important</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the most important thing that i</p>
<p>have to talk about so if anyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>checked out</p>
<p>check back in right now do you hear</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve heard that obesity is a health</p>
<p>risk right it causes</p>
<p>diabetes heart attack stroke</p>
<p>cancer bad luck right everything right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i was taught too but i found</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s absolutely</p>
<p>not true it&rsquo;s a myth let me explain</p>
<p>i had a patient come in 29 years old</p>
<p>weighed 325 pounds</p>
<p>did my program this is a long time ago</p>
<p>take a while guess how much weight she</p>
<p>lost in the first month</p>
<p>nope nope nope</p>
<p>nope no exactly it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>zero pounds she lost zero pounds okay</p>
<p>now who would be depressed if you lost</p>
<p>zero weight yeah</p>
<p>but she was actually okay with it</p>
<p>because she felt better okay</p>
<p>the second month she lost 21 pounds</p>
<p>the third month she lost 63 pounds</p>
<p>it was at that point when i had a light</p>
<p>bulb go off</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like wow you don&rsquo;t you don&rsquo;t lose</p>
<p>weight and get healthy</p>
<p>you get healthy to lose weight see i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been doing it the other way around</p>
<p>that changed my whole practice because</p>
<p>now everything that i aligned</p>
<p>was going to get them healthy and i</p>
<p>started to see results on people that</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t normally ever get results</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the health you cannot be fat and</p>
<p>healthy at the same time</p>
<p>being healthy the weight comes off as a</p>
<p>natural side effect</p>
<p>obesity is a symptom of an unhealthy</p>
<p>body not the cause of it</p>
<p>why are they doing that why are they</p>
<p>pushing it so they can come up with the</p>
<p>drugs to treat it again it&rsquo;s a symptom</p>
<p>does this make sense so</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what i want you to do i want you</p>
<p>to change</p>
<p>your viewpoint goal from</p>
<p>losing weight to creating more health go</p>
<p>ahead and do it right now</p>
<p>go ahead and just shift make the shift</p>
<p>come on</p>
<p>in the back there shift it okay good so</p>
<p>have you decided that you&rsquo;ll create more</p>
<p>health</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s how you do it forget</p>
<p>about the diets</p>
<p>we have to get your lifestyle corrected</p>
<p>forget about vitamins unless you can get</p>
<p>your eating corrected</p>
<p>because understanding that is a superior</p>
<p>principle</p>
<p>that will take you not just to lose</p>
<p>weight but to get younger as you get</p>
<p>older</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m 65 no i&rsquo;m just kidding</p>
<p>no i&rsquo;m 47 but i feel like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>25 i mean i wrestle</p>
<p>my kids and i um and i&rsquo;m like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>working out</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m actually trying to reverse the aging</p>
<p>process and so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i want you guys to do every</p>
<p>year you get older you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>younger</p>
<p>but all it takes is a shift of viewpoint</p>
<p>rather than oh here&rsquo;s the diet you have</p>
<p>to understand what to do</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s three things i want you to do</p>
<p>number one find out your body type</p>
<p>number two get in a plan that&rsquo;s specific</p>
<p>for your body type</p>
<p>and number three to it through creating</p>
<p>healthy habits that you can do long term</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s all about create your health</p>
<p>every day it has to be built</p>
<p>just like everything else in life</p>
<p>i want to thank you guys for coming i</p>
<p>hope you learned something i appreciate</p>
<p>your attention this long</p>
<p>have a great afternoon</p>
