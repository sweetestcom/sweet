    <p>hi guys how are you today</p>
<p>my name is Bailey Syrian</p>
<p>and today is Monday</p>
<p>which means murder mystery and makeup</p>
<p>so today&rsquo;s case involves</p>
<p>words that I&rsquo;m having a hard time pronouncing</p>
<p>and of course</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m looking into this case</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m reading all into it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like yeah</p>
<p>yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>and then it comes down to me</p>
<p>pronouncing it</p>
<p>like the names and stuff</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>why did I do this to myself</p>
<p>look we&rsquo;re going to Brazil</p>
<p>okay the name of the city is</p>
<p>I watched 1t of pronunciation videos</p>
<p>okay come on</p>
<p>Bailey Sal bao</p>
<p>Sal bao wait</p>
<p>Sal bao Brazil</p>
<p>did I say it</p>
<p>this is embarrassing anyways</p>
<p>so if you are new here</p>
<p>every Monday I&rsquo;ve been doing murder mystery and makeup</p>
<p>where I sit down</p>
<p>I get ready</p>
<p>I do my makeup</p>
<p>and I talk about a true crime</p>
<p>that has caught my interest</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s on my mind</p>
<p>and we just have an open discussion</p>
<p>today I&rsquo;m going to be talking about Suzanne</p>
<p>von Richthofen</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna talk about her</p>
<p>this happened back in 2002 in Brazil</p>
<p>south South Korea</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>guess I can&rsquo;t go to Brazil</p>
<p>should I do a dramatic voice</p>
<p>when I talk about these things</p>
<p>suzanne&rsquo;s father was a German engineer</p>
<p>so suzanne&rsquo;s father was a German engineer</p>
<p>and her mother was a Brazilian of Lebanese descent</p>
<p>working as a psychiatrist</p>
<p>very smart successful parents</p>
<p>Suzanne also had a younger brother Andreas</p>
<p>this is so embarrassing</p>
<p>Andre I can&rsquo;t roll my r&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and Andre you know what Andreas</p>
<p>This is why I stick with cathy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Suzanne had a younger brother Andreas</p>
<p>who was born in 1987</p>
<p>susanna studied at a German high school</p>
<p>and then went to study law at a Catholic university</p>
<p>so she was very smart</p>
<p>she was described as happy</p>
<p>a little shy</p>
<p>and was known to have a really good relationship</p>
<p>with her family</p>
<p>her brother</p>
<p>her mom and dad</p>
<p>like everyone got along</p>
<p>and they seemed like a happy family</p>
<p>every single one of these stories goes right</p>
<p>am I right so far</p>
<p>her parents were very successful</p>
<p>so they lived in a really nice neighborhood</p>
<p>it was a gated community</p>
<p>it was a beautiful home</p>
<p>she was well educated</p>
<p>and she was pretty</p>
<p>she was blonde she&rsquo;s cute</p>
<p>the estimated</p>
<p>wealth of the family was 55 million dollars</p>
<p>and there were 2 anonymous accounts in Swiss banks</p>
<p>containing at least 10 million euros</p>
<p>which were opened by suzanne&rsquo;s father</p>
<p>when she turned 18</p>
<p>2001 summer 1999</p>
<p>she started practicing Brazilian jiu jitsu</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where she met Daniel</p>
<p>her and Daniel hit it off</p>
<p>she thought he was cute</p>
<p>he thought she was cute</p>
<p>and they ended up becoming a boyfriend and girlfriend</p>
<p>reports had that</p>
<p>like the relationship happened pretty quick</p>
<p>you know when you&rsquo;re a teenager</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not really taking anything slow</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>you meet someone</p>
<p>you get into a relationship right away</p>
<p>not everyone</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t really get to know the person</p>
<p>her parents were okay with their relationship at first</p>
<p>they liked him</p>
<p>and they thought he was really nice</p>
<p>so the parents being okay with the relationship</p>
<p>did not last long</p>
<p>so after some time</p>
<p>they realized that Daniel</p>
<p>the boyfriend</p>
<p>that he was just smoking weed 24 7</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t have a job</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t going to school</p>
<p>he just wasn&rsquo;t doing anything with his life</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t like that</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t want that</p>
<p>for their daughter</p>
<p>well he just wasn&rsquo;t doing anything with his life</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>how parents can be</p>
<p>they just don&rsquo;t understand teenagers</p>
<p>so they were really pressuring</p>
<p>Susan to end it with Daniel okay</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t benefiting her in any way</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t want her daughter wasting her time with him</p>
<p>and they certainly did not want</p>
<p>their daughter getting into drugs</p>
<p>or just who knows what this boy&rsquo;s up to</p>
<p>so naturally</p>
<p>of course she&rsquo;s not gonna break up with him</p>
<p>no I was reading about the story whatever</p>
<p>and it said that the mom and dad went on vacation</p>
<p>right for a month</p>
<p>who goes on a vacation</p>
<p>for a month</p>
<p>anyways so Mom and Dad went on a vacation</p>
<p>for a month</p>
<p>where I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find where</p>
<p>and while they were on vacation</p>
<p>Suzanne had her boyfriend</p>
<p>Daniel move in with her</p>
<p>into the family home</p>
<p>while they were gone</p>
<p>but she&rsquo;s already</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s turning into this rebellious teenager</p>
<p>we know how this goes</p>
<p>okay so then</p>
<p>a month goes by</p>
<p>and her parents return</p>
<p>when her parents returned</p>
<p>she asked her mom and dad if</p>
<p>they would buy her her own apartment</p>
<p>that way she could live with Daniel</p>
<p>and she could have some freedom</p>
<p>and just do whatever she likes</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re teenagers</p>
<p>really all you wanna do</p>
<p>is move out</p>
<p>of your parents house</p>
<p>she knew that</p>
<p>they had the money</p>
<p>her dad her father</p>
<p>quickly shut that down</p>
<p>he was like nope</p>
<p>you are not moving in with him</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not getting a place with him</p>
<p>no no and no</p>
<p>her mother and father</p>
<p>being you know</p>
<p>the good parents</p>
<p>that they are were like</p>
<p>you can move out</p>
<p>just make money</p>
<p>get a job make your own money</p>
<p>and you could afford your own place</p>
<p>Suzanne did not like that idea</p>
<p>again the teenage brain</p>
<p>you just think</p>
<p>like no Mom</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not how it works</p>
<p>so Suzanne kept seeing Daniel</p>
<p>and as their relationship progressed</p>
<p>there became a strain on</p>
<p>the relationship</p>
<p>with Suzanne</p>
<p>and her parents</p>
<p>they really wanted Suzanne</p>
<p>to end the relationship with Daniel</p>
<p>they kept pressuring her to end it</p>
<p>and Suzanne of course</p>
<p>just did not want to</p>
<p>so she just really wasn&rsquo;t budging</p>
<p>so then finally</p>
<p>suzanne&rsquo;s parents gave an ultimatum</p>
<p>break up with Daniel</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re gonna stop giving you an allowance</p>
<p>see Suzanne was</p>
<p>still receiving an allowance</p>
<p>from her parents</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>about to cut it off</p>
<p>because Suzanne was not</p>
<p>obeying the family at all</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>break up with him</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re not gonna get your allowance</p>
<p>that simple</p>
<p>but a lot of us don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>to do this next thing</p>
<p>this is a mess</p>
<p>okay October 31st</p>
<p>2002 Suzanne</p>
<p>and her brother</p>
<p>went to a cyber cafe</p>
<p>to play video games</p>
<p>and meet up</p>
<p>with friends</p>
<p>then Suzanne</p>
<p>met up with Daniel</p>
<p>and daniel&rsquo;s brother</p>
<p>his name is Christian</p>
<p>so daniel&rsquo;s 21</p>
<p>and Christian is 26</p>
<p>so earlier that day</p>
<p>Suzanne had deactivated the home</p>
<p>security cameras</p>
<p>at the parents</p>
<p>house at her house</p>
<p>she deactivated them</p>
<p>she turned off the</p>
<p>alarm system</p>
<p>and this would</p>
<p>trigger the alarm</p>
<p>if somebody opens the door</p>
<p>obviously the security cameras</p>
<p>would be there</p>
<p>to catch anybody</p>
<p>coming in and out</p>
<p>so she turns all of that off suspicious</p>
<p>suspicious Daniel the boyfriend</p>
<p>and Christian the brother</p>
<p>pull into the home</p>
<p>she opens up the gates</p>
<p>and they pull into the garage</p>
<p>they put on their hoods from their jackets</p>
<p>and they head into the home</p>
<p>so Suzanne goes in first</p>
<p>Suzanne goes up the stairs</p>
<p>to make sure that her parents are indeed there sleeping</p>
<p>she comes back downstairs</p>
<p>to let the boys know they&rsquo;re upstairs handle it</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t say that</p>
<p>but like I think that&rsquo;s what she said</p>
<p>Suzanne sat on the couch</p>
<p>and both of the boys headed upstairs</p>
<p>to the parents room</p>
<p>the 2 brothers had iron bars with them</p>
<p>iron bars and they started to beat the parents</p>
<p>with these iron beat them</p>
<p>they started to beat them</p>
<p>they bashed their heads in</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll try to at least</p>
<p>but the parents did not die</p>
<p>they were still alive</p>
<p>and they were holding on</p>
<p>because they were being attacked</p>
<p>the parents</p>
<p>obviously were screaming and yelling</p>
<p>they were being loud apparently</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s when Daniel decided to run to the bathroom</p>
<p>and grab wet towels</p>
<p>put it over their face</p>
<p>to drown out the noises</p>
<p>guess they also tried to strangle the parents with the</p>
<p>towels as well</p>
<p>apparently the parents were still not dying</p>
<p>they were not dying</p>
<p>so of course</p>
<p>because these are bright young men</p>
<p>they decide to go downstairs and grab a jug of water</p>
<p>because well</p>
<p>Daniel goes downstairs to grab a jug of water</p>
<p>and because he got this idea to drown the parents</p>
<p>with a jug of water</p>
<p>now that&rsquo;s all I could find</p>
<p>was that Daniel Drought</p>
<p>was trying to drown the parents with this jug of water</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t really know what that means</p>
<p>and then I read one website that said</p>
<p>they just strangled them with a towel</p>
<p>but okay daniel&rsquo;s pouring water on their faces</p>
<p>this did indeed kill</p>
<p>suzanne&rsquo;s father</p>
<p>so suzanne&rsquo;s father passed away</p>
<p>but suzanne&rsquo;s mother was still holding on to dear life</p>
<p>so the boys</p>
<p>Daniel and Christian</p>
<p>they ended up getting a plastic bag</p>
<p>they tied it around her head</p>
<p>and they waited until she suffocated and died</p>
<p>they died a very like slow</p>
<p>painful death</p>
<p>which is so sad to Zan</p>
<p>was just on the couch the whole time</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t believe that</p>
<p>but whatever</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t there</p>
<p>so what do I know</p>
<p>so once the mother had died</p>
<p>and things had quieted down</p>
<p>Suzanne went upstairs</p>
<p>to make sure</p>
<p>are they dead</p>
<p>and then the 3 of them came up with a plan</p>
<p>to stage the scenes</p>
<p>they wanted to make it look like there was a robbery</p>
<p>in the house</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re so dumb and sloppy</p>
<p>they scattered some papers around</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t like messy</p>
<p>I guess it was like</p>
<p>you could tell</p>
<p>it was a perfect</p>
<p>little scatter of papers</p>
<p>they also took a bunch of money from the parents room</p>
<p>they just kind of shuffled things around</p>
<p>to make it look like it was indeed a break in</p>
<p>this part of the plan</p>
<p>that they had</p>
<p>was just done so poorly</p>
<p>they did not think this through</p>
<p>they staged a break in</p>
<p>and the break in</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t even look like a break in</p>
<p>it looked like someone staged it</p>
<p>apparently they left behind some</p>
<p>important stuff</p>
<p>like they left behind a cell phone</p>
<p>one report said that they left behind a gun</p>
<p>my thought was</p>
<p>if they had a gun</p>
<p>why wouldn&rsquo;t they use it</p>
<p>when they were attacking the parents</p>
<p>because they seemed to be having a really hard time</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t have picked one with a language barrier</p>
<p>that was a bad call on my end</p>
<p>but what I do know was</p>
<p>it was sloppy</p>
<p>but the one thing that they did take off with</p>
<p>was 1t of money</p>
<p>good for them</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna start their life</p>
<p>with all this money</p>
<p>Cha ching so</p>
<p>then their idea was okay</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go check into a hotel</p>
<p>and use that</p>
<p>like as an alibi</p>
<p>see we were at a hotel</p>
<p>and then Christian</p>
<p>the Daniels brother</p>
<p>he went to a fast food restaurant again</p>
<p>to use like</p>
<p>as an alibi</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming</p>
<p>showing the receipt</p>
<p>at this time</p>
<p>he was at this fast food restaurant</p>
<p>so they were trying to get their alibi straight</p>
<p>after some time</p>
<p>Suzanne then checked out of the hotel</p>
<p>and she went to go pick up her brother</p>
<p>he was still at the cyber cafe</p>
<p>so she went to go pick him up</p>
<p>Christian and Daniel had left</p>
<p>picks her brother up</p>
<p>and they head home</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s episode</p>
<p>is brought to you</p>
<p>by apostrophe</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s apostrophe</p>
<p>you ask well</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a prescription</p>
<p>skincare company</p>
<p>that offers science backed</p>
<p>oral and topical medications</p>
<p>that are clinically proven</p>
<p>to help clear acne</p>
<p>apostrophe connects you with a board certified</p>
<p>dermatologist</p>
<p>who create a personalized</p>
<p>treatment plan</p>
<p>that is perfectly tailored to you</p>
<p>and your unique skin</p>
<p>so Suzanne picks up her brother</p>
<p>from the Internet cafe</p>
<p>they go back to the house</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s when they discover</p>
<p>the family together</p>
<p>obviously for the brother</p>
<p>it was like tragic</p>
<p>both of his parents are dead</p>
<p>looks like someone broke in</p>
<p>they instantly called the police</p>
<p>and when the police got there</p>
<p>they were told that somebody broke in</p>
<p>and killed their parents</p>
<p>but the police knew</p>
<p>by looking at the scene</p>
<p>no this looks a little fishy</p>
<p>police suspected that</p>
<p>it was somebody close to the family</p>
<p>just because of how it was done</p>
<p>somebody who knew them</p>
<p>they also noted that the alarm system was turned off</p>
<p>so somebody had to be inside of the house</p>
<p>and that was a red flag</p>
<p>this break in</p>
<p>looked there were papers</p>
<p>kind of like</p>
<p>scattered perfectly around</p>
<p>it just seemed a little bit more planned</p>
<p>than the family was making it out to be</p>
<p>so so they suspected sister and brother in general</p>
<p>but then they narrowed it down to Suzanne</p>
<p>and the reason that they narrowed it down to just</p>
<p>Suzanne was because it was her 19th birthday</p>
<p>the next day</p>
<p>and she had friends over to the house</p>
<p>and her boyfriend</p>
<p>and they were hanging out</p>
<p>celebrating her birthday</p>
<p>and swimming in the pool</p>
<p>her parents just died</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re having a party</p>
<p>super suspicious</p>
<p>come on girl</p>
<p>sloppy so that&rsquo;s why investigators</p>
<p>really cute</p>
<p>in on Suzanne</p>
<p>and also her boyfriend</p>
<p>oops oh my gosh</p>
<p>so Christian</p>
<p>the brother</p>
<p>daniel&rsquo;s brother</p>
<p>he ended up buying a motorcycle</p>
<p>like a couple days later after</p>
<p>the murders</p>
<p>and he paid cash for it</p>
<p>now coming from his background</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t come from a good neighborhood</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t have a job</p>
<p>this rose red flags</p>
<p>because where did he get that money from</p>
<p>so that was stupid on his end</p>
<p>he couldn&rsquo;t wait a little bit longer</p>
<p>he did it just a few days after the murders</p>
<p>Christian was the first one to get arrested</p>
<p>and he paid in all 100 bills</p>
<p>so you got something to do with this</p>
<p>after being questioned by police</p>
<p>Suzanne eventually broke down</p>
<p>and she confessed to killing her parents</p>
<p>and this actually turned into like</p>
<p>a huge media focus case</p>
<p>because of the big contrast between the 2 brothers</p>
<p>Daniel and Christian</p>
<p>and Suzanne</p>
<p>this is so sad</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>we stereotype</p>
<p>when you look at the 2 brothers</p>
<p>they looks like criminals</p>
<p>okay Suzanne was this pretty</p>
<p>intelligent</p>
<p>blonde hair girl</p>
<p>people did not want to believe</p>
<p>that Suzanne had anything to do with this</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>they were all on her side</p>
<p>like no she didn&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way</p>
<p>the brothers did it</p>
<p>so it created like</p>
<p>a really big divide</p>
<p>Suzanne was just well educated</p>
<p>she spoke 3 different languages</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way she killed her parents</p>
<p>what was the motive</p>
<p>she already had money</p>
<p>public was heavily questioning</p>
<p>whether Suzanne did this or not</p>
<p>there was actually a TV interview with Suzanne</p>
<p>and she was talking about what had happened</p>
<p>playing the victim</p>
<p>essentially</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s this part</p>
<p>where she was getting coached by her attorney</p>
<p>the cameras were rolling</p>
<p>and this guy</p>
<p>leans in and tells Suzanne</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking about it</p>
<p>make sure to cry</p>
<p>and cry loud and cry hard</p>
<p>because then people will believe you more</p>
<p>so the camera is caught him</p>
<p>coaching Suzanne</p>
<p>how to act and they rolled it on TV</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s when everyone was like</p>
<p>okay she did it</p>
<p>we take everything back</p>
<p>she did it honestly</p>
<p>it was looking like Suzanne</p>
<p>could have potentially gotten away with this</p>
<p>just because everyone was on her side</p>
<p>but that TV interview</p>
<p>is what really sealed the deal</p>
<p>July 2006 4 years after the murders</p>
<p>Suzanne Daniel and Christian were put on trial</p>
<p>for first degree murder</p>
<p>Suzanne pointed the finger</p>
<p>and put the blame on Daniel and Christian</p>
<p>saying it was their idea</p>
<p>and they were the ones who did it</p>
<p>her lawyer also said that there was no motive</p>
<p>and she was directed to follow through with the</p>
<p>crime by Daniel</p>
<p>she looked up to him as a god</p>
<p>and it was just</p>
<p>she was obsessed with him</p>
<p>she was so in love with him</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why she went along with it</p>
<p>but Daniel and Christian</p>
<p>pointed the finger back at Suzanne</p>
<p>saying it was all her idea</p>
<p>they followed through with it</p>
<p>because they were gonna get some of the money</p>
<p>sounded like</p>
<p>a promising future for them</p>
<p>in different documents</p>
<p>it was saying that in court</p>
<p>Susanna had no emotion</p>
<p>she wasn&rsquo;t crying at all</p>
<p>and both brothers</p>
<p>cried a lot</p>
<p>throughout the trial</p>
<p>there was a point</p>
<p>where Suzanne started to laugh when</p>
<p>they were being questioned</p>
<p>which isn&rsquo;t a good look in court</p>
<p>they had a motive</p>
<p>they knew what the motive was</p>
<p>and why Suzanne did it</p>
<p>her parents</p>
<p>passed away</p>
<p>Suzanne was going to inherit</p>
<p>$17,000,000</p>
<p>from her parents</p>
<p>$17,000,000</p>
<p>she wouldn&rsquo;t have to go to school</p>
<p>she could move out</p>
<p>with Daniel</p>
<p>she could just live this awesome life</p>
<p>without having to work</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>this teenage girl&rsquo;s dream in court</p>
<p>they also made a lot of low blow</p>
<p>so Suzanne said that</p>
<p>her father was sexually abusing her</p>
<p>and also that her parents were alcoholics</p>
<p>she was just pulling</p>
<p>everything she could</p>
<p>out of a hat</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like yeah</p>
<p>what about this</p>
<p>though okay</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re alcoholics</p>
<p>now yep uh huh</p>
<p>oh no okay uh</p>
<p>sexually abused me</p>
<p>yeah he did that</p>
<p>but Andreas</p>
<p>her younger brother testified</p>
<p>and actually</p>
<p>their parents were not alcoholics</p>
<p>there was no</p>
<p>sexual abuse happening</p>
<p>in the autopsy</p>
<p>of the parents</p>
<p>they found no alcohol</p>
<p>in their bloodstream</p>
<p>does that prove that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re alcoholics or not</p>
<p>no not necessarily</p>
<p>but it didn&rsquo;t really help her</p>
<p>claim at all</p>
<p>prosecutors said that</p>
<p>Susanna was the mastermind</p>
<p>behind all of it</p>
<p>and they wanted to give her 50 years in prison</p>
<p>that was the goal</p>
<p>July 22 2006</p>
<p>is when Suzanne Christian</p>
<p>and Daniel all got sentenced</p>
<p>so Suzanne ended up getting</p>
<p>40 years in prison</p>
<p>Christian and Daniel got 38 years</p>
<p>in prison in 2009</p>
<p>Suzanne appealed</p>
<p>she wanted to get</p>
<p>house arrest</p>
<p>which it was denied</p>
<p>in 2011 suzanne&rsquo;s younger brother Andreas</p>
<p>he sued his sister</p>
<p>for half of the inheritance</p>
<p>she got from her parents</p>
<p>so brazil&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>with their laws</p>
<p>obviously so</p>
<p>she was still</p>
<p>going to be able to get the money</p>
<p>when she gets out of jail</p>
<p>if it was in her name</p>
<p>she was still</p>
<p>gonna be able to get the money</p>
<p>so even though she went to prison</p>
<p>she has something to look forward to</p>
<p>when she gets out</p>
<p>as long as it&rsquo;s in her name</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still hers</p>
<p>but her younger brother</p>
<p>had sued her</p>
<p>for half of the inheritance</p>
<p>so he ended up winning</p>
<p>and he got everything</p>
<p>also in Brazil</p>
<p>I was reading that</p>
<p>they have this law where</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in prison</p>
<p>as long as it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>like some horrendous crime</p>
<p>you have good behavior</p>
<p>you can actually get out of prison</p>
<p>for holidays</p>
<p>so Suzanne got out</p>
<p>on mother&rsquo;s Day Christmas</p>
<p>there was another holiday too</p>
<p>just every holiday</p>
<p>if you have good behavior</p>
<p>they actually release you from prison</p>
<p>for up to 7 days</p>
<p>and then you come back</p>
<p>and you finish up your sentence</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that weird</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of interesting</p>
<p>I wonder how that works out for them</p>
<p>like is that a</p>
<p>successful thing</p>
<p>I could imagine</p>
<p>it might be good</p>
<p>but it could also be very</p>
<p>very bad so</p>
<p>to this day</p>
<p>sitting her ass in prison</p>
<p>she only got 50 years</p>
<p>so once she&rsquo;s out she&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>first and foremost</p>
<p>just wanna apologize</p>
<p>to all of Brazil</p>
<p>for mispronouncing everything</p>
<p>lesson learned</p>
<p>but other than that</p>
<p>she obviously did it</p>
<p>she was entitled</p>
<p>she was a spoiled</p>
<p>little brat</p>
<p>and she was</p>
<p>a narcissist</p>
<p>random thought</p>
<p>do you think</p>
<p>if Suzanne had broken up</p>
<p>with Daniel</p>
<p>do you think</p>
<p>she would have</p>
<p>still killed her parents</p>
<p>or do you think nothing</p>
<p>would have happened</p>
<p>I guess the</p>
<p>moral of the</p>
<p>story here is kids suck</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>because it sounded like</p>
<p>they were raising</p>
<p>their daughter</p>
<p>really well</p>
<p>do you think</p>
<p>people are just born like that</p>
<p>or did she learn that</p>
<p>anyways I hope</p>
<p>you have a good day today</p>
<p>you make good choices</p>
<p>thank you so much</p>
<p>for hanging out with me today</p>
<p>and I will be seeing you guys later bye</p>
