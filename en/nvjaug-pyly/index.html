to</p><p>replace your medical care check with</p><p>your doc before you</p><p>you know do any things that we talk</p><p>about and uh</p><p>and so</p><p>as we&rsquo;re going through the show um</p><p>you know what i&rsquo;ll be really curious</p><p>about if you could in the chat</p><p>type this question down this answer to</p><p>the question i want to find out how many</p><p>people are new to keto</p><p>and if or experience taquito so if you</p><p>could just</p><p>make a note in the chat i&rsquo;ll be curious</p><p>what the answer is because i always i</p><p>never asked that question i wanted to</p><p>find out so that way i can tailor make</p><p>my answers</p><p>all right steve all right well i tell</p><p>you so let&rsquo;s kick it off from social</p><p>media now rhonda is not uh exclaiming</p><p>that she they&rsquo;re saying that she&rsquo;s on</p><p>keto but</p><p>uh she is</p><p>fasting and here&rsquo;s the earthy question</p><p>is is it normal to have loose watery</p><p>steels during a 48 hour fast</p><p>no</p><p>no it&rsquo;s not normal and there&rsquo;s obviously</p><p>probably something going on with your uh</p><p>your microbes that there&rsquo;s some</p><p>imbalance and</p><p>you know</p><p>sometimes uh</p><p>if you actually do a first fast and uh</p><p>like you haven&rsquo;t done it before</p><p>um what can happen is um</p><p>you know you&rsquo;re like these microbes are</p><p>so used to getting fed</p><p>all of a sudden you don&rsquo;t feed them and</p><p>there could be a problem so um</p><p>it&rsquo;s not normal i think</p><p>what i would probably recommend is to</p><p>take a probiotic</p><p>that would be good</p><p>take something that survives the stomach</p><p>acid too that&rsquo;s important</p><p>kefir is a good</p><p>natural probiotic as well</p><p>great her microbes are rebelling uh</p><p>debra from youtube what are your</p><p>thoughts about drinking ketones while on</p><p>keto diet yay or nay</p><p>so it&rsquo;s an expensive way to do it i</p><p>think</p><p>the only reason i would do that is</p><p>if i had some type of dementia</p><p>or some</p><p>let&rsquo;s say i seizures something like that</p><p>that i wanted to raise my a level of</p><p>ketones up or maybe i&rsquo;m going to</p><p>exercise and get a little more energy</p><p>but typically like</p><p>there was a</p><p>guy that i just talked to recently that</p><p>was a type 1 diabetic</p><p>and his ketones went up to like a 5.5</p><p>which is pretty darn good and he was a</p><p>diabetic so</p><p>it really depends on where your ketones</p><p>are do you want to increase them i mean</p><p>it&rsquo;s</p><p>it&rsquo;s not going to help with weight loss</p><p>it might just</p><p>you know you&rsquo;re already generating this</p><p>these ketones um i think it&rsquo;d be kind of</p><p>an overkill to just take additional</p><p>ketones but</p><p>that being said you know ketones do help</p><p>the brain so you you could always</p><p>you know</p><p>get benefits from that and get more</p><p>energy</p><p>all right go for that laura from youtube</p><p>could you please do a video on</p><p>uh acidic choline did i say that right</p><p>terry was trying to find</p><p>thank you and function in the heart</p><p>okay</p><p>all right i just made a note of that</p><p>will do wonderful and let&rsquo;s do one more</p><p>before we kick over to something else</p><p>helene from youtube i did watch your</p><p>video about cholesterol should i be</p><p>taking both niacin and tudka together</p><p>how many milligrams of tutka should i be</p><p>taking a day</p><p>well you know you only want to take that</p><p>if you there&rsquo;s a concern if there&rsquo;s a</p><p>problem um</p><p>but tutka is a bile salt and choline is</p><p>actually in the bile salts so you&rsquo;re</p><p>taking something to kind of break things</p><p>up</p><p>you&rsquo;ll get</p><p>lower readings you&rsquo;ll get more digestion</p><p>break break above this cholesterol and</p><p>if you&rsquo;re doing keto healthily with low</p><p>carbs okay and fasting there really</p><p>isn&rsquo;t any need</p><p>for uh worrying about cholesterol</p><p>but it&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re cheating or just</p><p>like you&rsquo;re doing it sort of</p><p>correct or you&rsquo;re</p><p>still eating carbs that&rsquo;s when there&rsquo;s a</p><p>problem with cholesterol</p><p>all right my guess is the audience</p><p>begging for a question so here&rsquo;s the</p><p>first one</p><p>all right so</p><p>what test can determine</p><p>your longevity now i&rsquo;m talking i&rsquo;m not</p><p>talking about an expensive</p><p>lab test what&rsquo;s a simple test that can</p><p>determine your longevity how long you&rsquo;re</p><p>going to live</p><p>all right very good well we&rsquo;ve got an</p><p>interesting</p><p>group in the green room and the first</p><p>one i think would be fascinating is a</p><p>husband and wife team that promised to</p><p>argue on the air and let&rsquo;s see who wins</p><p>now i&rsquo;m just kidding this is uh ariel</p><p>who i think is speaking on behalf of her</p><p>husband and ariel if you would unmute</p><p>yourself you and nathan are wrong with</p><p>dr byrd</p><p>hi how&rsquo;s it going</p><p>great</p><p>go ahead with your questions</p><p>dr berg actually</p><p>oh i can hear you perfectly can you hear</p><p>me now</p><p>that&rsquo;s interesting uh the rest of the</p><p>team there can you all hear dr byrd</p><p>a head shake if you can yeah the rest of</p><p>your uh cohorts can uh this might be or</p><p>can you do this see if you can speaking</p><p>over to me real quickly ariel and i&rsquo;ll</p><p>uh sort of transcribe it verbally for</p><p>you</p><p>well why don&rsquo;t you just uh you can ask</p><p>her she can answer the question and then</p><p>i can just you know answer it i mean she</p><p>just asked the question because you can</p><p>hear i&rsquo;m sorry go ahead ariel so ask a</p><p>question please</p><p>all right yeah no um i i just can&rsquo;t hear</p><p>dr berg&rsquo;s uh response but uh anyways um</p><p>my question is</p><p>um</p><p>yeah sorry i&rsquo;m just getting my camera</p><p>here um is that my husband has been</p><p>having a foot uh issue for the last like</p><p>10 years</p><p>um and he has gone on ken on the candida</p><p>diet</p><p>so during that period of time he did not</p><p>have the foot issue the foot issue is</p><p>that he gets cracked cracked heels an</p><p>itchy toe itchy bottom of the foot he</p><p>also gets peely skin as well too</p><p>um so we&rsquo;ve been doing the keto healthy</p><p>keto for about</p><p>five uh no sorry three months now we&rsquo;re</p><p>almost six months postpartum actually</p><p>um and um so obviously we&rsquo;re not getting</p><p>a lot of sleep um but he&rsquo;s been it the</p><p>foot skin been getting better</p><p>however um</p><p>uh it does have some flare-ups here and</p><p>there so we just wanted to</p><p>we did purchase your liver uh course</p><p>online which was great and and your</p><p>videos about the liver&rsquo;s connection to</p><p>the foot has been great but we just</p><p>wanted to check in and just to see if</p><p>we&rsquo;re on the right track and whatnot</p><p>yeah i think you are on the right track</p><p>um</p><p>the um</p><p>the problem is there&rsquo;s probably some</p><p>residual overgrowth of candida going on</p><p>in the foot that&rsquo;s tender it&rsquo;s a perfect</p><p>environment with being moist and things</p><p>like that so</p><p>i&rsquo;m glad you reduced sugar because</p><p>that&rsquo;s ultimately going to correct it</p><p>but the dry</p><p>cracked skin is</p><p>the result of the microbes so tea tree</p><p>oil</p><p>mixed with</p><p>a coconut oil</p><p>applied topically</p><p>each night before i go to bed i think</p><p>would be the best remedy for him</p><p>so you might not be able to hear me</p><p>talking but you can re watch the</p><p>recording when um you know when we&rsquo;re</p><p>done with this show today</p><p>well uh ariel i&rsquo;m sorry for the</p><p>technical difficulty on you&rsquo;re in there</p><p>or whatever but uh dr berg just gave you</p><p>uh a comment and also urged you to watch</p><p>the recording of the show on either</p><p>youtube or facebook and uh you&rsquo;ll be</p><p>able to uh get his counsel which i think</p><p>was very sound so anyway i hope you and</p><p>uh awesome your husband have a blast</p><p>thanks for having us we really</p><p>appreciate it yeah and congratulations</p><p>on your burgeoning family there that&rsquo;s</p><p>really fun</p><p>so</p><p>don&rsquo;t worry you&rsquo;ll get some sleep after</p><p>they&rsquo;re about 16 to 18. uh until until</p><p>then yeah you know it&rsquo;s gonna be a</p><p>full-time job</p><p>all right well thank you so much</p><p>and uh nathan and again watch the show</p><p>after the fact and um you will</p><p>be</p><p>uh updated on what uh is going on with</p><p>your uh itchy foot your husbands that</p><p>you foot so thanks for joining us and uh</p><p>the audience is always as quick with</p><p>their answers and the first question of</p><p>this show asked</p><p>what task can best determine your</p><p>longevity and the audience claims or at</p><p>least 90 percent of them say a cac test</p><p>five percent say a liver enzyme test and</p><p>five percent say a urine test</p><p>so so you know everyone is right on that</p><p>and csc is a really good predictor of</p><p>mortality for sure</p><p>but regarding longevity um</p><p>and</p><p>people that are</p><p>aging and getting to a point where</p><p>you know things are breaking down</p><p>there&rsquo;s a</p><p>um a really good test</p><p>and that would be</p><p>so</p><p>seat to standing test just by getting</p><p>off your chair</p><p>and your grip strength because what</p><p>happens as</p><p>we age uh we start to lose muscle that&rsquo;s</p><p>the real big thing and it&rsquo;s called the</p><p>sarcopenia age-related muscle loss and</p><p>so one quick test is just to see how</p><p>fast you can get up from a seated</p><p>position or off the floor</p><p>so um</p><p>i might be</p><p>aging really fast because like it takes</p><p>me a long time to especially after this</p><p>last workout yesterday i could barely</p><p>get off the floor i can barely walk</p><p>actually</p><p>so um but if you didn&rsquo;t work out just</p><p>getting up</p><p>quickly is an indication of</p><p>strong muscles and that means you don&rsquo;t</p><p>have a problem with sarcopenia but</p><p>it&rsquo;s a you know they just isolated that</p><p>as a good um</p><p>task to do it&rsquo;s non-invasive and um</p><p>and then i&rsquo;m gonna release a video on</p><p>what to do to kind of</p><p>prolong that process and what to do when</p><p>you have sarcopenia</p><p>so stay tuned for that video</p><p>doc for those of us who don&rsquo;t know can</p><p>you tell us what a cac test is what does</p><p>that mean yeah it&rsquo;s coronary artery</p><p>calcification</p><p>scan or a test or a score and then so</p><p>what they do is they just it&rsquo;s a</p><p>relatively inexpensive test but they do</p><p>use the cat scan</p><p>and they look into the heart and look at</p><p>the coronary artery the main artery to</p><p>the heart and they&rsquo;re looking for how</p><p>much calcium is in there there shouldn&rsquo;t</p><p>be any calcium in there but if there is</p><p>um it&rsquo;s kind of they&rsquo;ve associated with</p><p>a with a good predictor for mortality</p><p>from all causes of death so the more</p><p>calcium you have</p><p>the less</p><p>you have that you can live so</p><p>um</p><p>it should be zero</p><p>but um you know it can go over a</p><p>thousand so</p><p>um it&rsquo;s a good test to do and um</p><p>because if you have calcium in your</p><p>artery</p><p>i think it&rsquo;s important to be aware of</p><p>that and so you could do something about</p><p>it i mean it&rsquo;s going to create some more</p><p>urgency</p><p>to like</p><p>start working on it</p><p>very good well some might say nobody</p><p>listens to dr berg&rsquo;s show oh yeah well</p><p>this morning we have people joining us</p><p>from the uk canada scotland egypt saudi</p><p>arabia belgium trinidad tobago greece</p><p>japan algeria cameroon australia france</p><p>germany mexico sweden taiwan the</p><p>netherlands</p><p>turkey the philippines macedonia india</p><p>norway nigeria hungary poland argentina</p><p>bermuda brazil switzerland panama</p><p>portugal iceland the united arab</p><p>emirates chile ghana south africa</p><p>pakistan iraq good to hear from you</p><p>folks new zealand italy peru bulgaria</p><p>iran</p><p>guyana</p><p>hong kong croatia spain jordan and of</p><p>course all across these united states</p><p>and i always blame terry for not</p><p>mentioning canada yet it was the second</p><p>up so plenty of people up north who are</p><p>also in our green room and they&rsquo;re going</p><p>to be joining us shortly</p><p>wow steve i think</p><p>this is so great compared to especially</p><p>where i came from doing um i remember</p><p>doing video doing seminars at whole</p><p>foods for for many years until i got</p><p>kicked out and um</p><p>i</p><p>i asked him like why why am i getting</p><p>kicked out of doing seminars and they go</p><p>well</p><p>there&rsquo;s been you know some people that</p><p>just really</p><p>never heard this information before and</p><p>they&rsquo;re a little bit upset i said and i</p><p>find out it&rsquo;s one person</p><p>that basically</p><p>complained because i told her something</p><p>she&rsquo;d never heard before</p><p>so i thought maybe that would be a</p><p>reason why you&rsquo;d want to go to a seminar</p><p>maybe you want to learn something but</p><p>so they kicked me out but then they let</p><p>me back in so i&rsquo;m glad we have a captive</p><p>audience that</p><p>would like to learn new things so well</p><p>your comeback to that woman is how do</p><p>you like me now</p><p>of course that&rsquo;s a</p><p>that&rsquo;ll show her anyway let&rsquo;s go back to</p><p>some more uh</p><p>great questions from</p><p>uh social media and this is ed from</p><p>youtube</p><p>poor guy why do i keep craving ice cream</p><p>after i&rsquo;ve given up bread maybe he needs</p><p>to give up more</p><p>well you crave it because you keep</p><p>eating it um i know i was in that trap</p><p>um boy as soon as you do it once it&rsquo;s</p><p>like the next day you want it again and</p><p>then you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re in the trap so you&rsquo;re</p><p>going to have to</p><p>use what&rsquo;s called</p><p>discipline right steve</p><p>to restrain yourself long enough till</p><p>those cravings go away</p><p>but um</p><p>recently i i i&rsquo;m trying something new</p><p>um</p><p>uh shifting not what i eat or the</p><p>pattern of what i eat but</p><p>when i eat i&rsquo;m trying something i&rsquo;m</p><p>taking that pattern of my first meal and</p><p>bringing it closer to breakfast now this</p><p>kind of opposed what i&rsquo;ve been telling</p><p>people but you&rsquo;re i&rsquo;m still fasting for</p><p>20 hours but i&rsquo;m eating earlier and i&rsquo;m</p><p>just experimenting there&rsquo;s some great</p><p>new information on how that can</p><p>improve results a little bit more</p><p>so it&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;ll have to stay</p><p>tuned to watch that video and see if you</p><p>want to try it out as well but again if</p><p>it&rsquo;s working for you don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t change</p><p>anything but um i&rsquo;m finding that</p><p>it aligns with your circadian rhythms a</p><p>bit more by by shifting this pattern my</p><p>first meal is in the morning and the</p><p>second meal is like</p><p>you know two o&rsquo;clock or one o&rsquo;clock</p><p>depending on what i eat and then boom</p><p>i&rsquo;m done</p><p>so um</p><p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s interesting so stay tuned for</p><p>that video coming out next week sometime</p><p>well that&rsquo;s interesting well ed i feel</p><p>for you and there are many of us out</p><p>here that do not</p><p>have the sort of intrinsic discipline</p><p>that many others do and all of us have</p><p>felt the pain for many years so you know</p><p>when i would try three freezer burned</p><p>lean cuisines per day for a healthy life</p><p>that lasted about 30 seconds couldn&rsquo;t</p><p>stand that just i&rsquo;d rather whatever</p><p>not be healthy but anyway this stuff the</p><p>dr berg it is now uh</p><p>11 a.m where i am and i have no desire</p><p>to eat whatsoever and about three</p><p>o&rsquo;clock today i&rsquo;ll have my first meal</p><p>and then i&rsquo;ll eat you know heartily and</p><p>so on and i&rsquo;m not perfect on the keto</p><p>stuff but my life has improved so much</p><p>so the great thing about</p><p>dr berg&rsquo;s various approaches is it&rsquo;s not</p><p>all or nothing is you continue to move</p><p>toward</p><p>uh you know a level of enjoyment of food</p><p>in a responsible way and you get</p><p>rewarded along the way which keeps</p><p>keeps you motivated so i feel better</p><p>emotionally i&rsquo;m not tired all these</p><p>things and yet i&rsquo;m not doing this thing</p><p>perfectly but i would never go all the</p><p>way back because i&rsquo;m getting rewards</p><p>that never happened before and and</p><p>giving it up you&rsquo;re a one meal a day</p><p>you&rsquo;re doing omad one meal a day right</p><p>yeah and well over maybe an hour and a</p><p>half but yeah so i&rsquo;ll have some cheese</p><p>and then i&rsquo;ll have the main sort of meal</p><p>this that and the other and something</p><p>and you know there might be a little</p><p>carbohydrate in there i don&rsquo;t want to</p><p>lie to you but that in toast so in an</p><p>hour and a half i consume what i&rsquo;m going</p><p>to have and man i feel better</p><p>you know um so if someone&rsquo;s on omad</p><p>which i i really i like that approach i</p><p>if you have that one meal</p><p>before three and maybe even at two</p><p>o&rsquo;clock at the very latest um i think</p><p>you you may</p><p>experience better</p><p>benefits with insulin improving insulin</p><p>resistance and sleeping</p><p>versus later at night</p><p>something to consider</p><p>very good</p><p>uh back to uh i think this might oh this</p><p>is youtube again kathy from youtube</p><p>what&rsquo;s the best indication that my h</p><p>pylori is gone blood work stool sample</p><p>or</p><p>breath test and if it&rsquo;s not gone what&rsquo;s</p><p>the best natural way to eliminate it</p><p>well</p><p>h pylori really is a</p><p>type of microbe that should not bother</p><p>us i mean it just kind of lives there</p><p>hangs out we most of us have it and</p><p>it just kind of</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t irritate us</p><p>um so</p><p>really it&rsquo;s not a matter of getting rid</p><p>of it it&rsquo;s a matter of putting it into a</p><p>state where it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like friendly to</p><p>us it&rsquo;s not unfriendly</p><p>so the symptoms that that will give you</p><p>would be something like an ulcer</p><p>uh gastritis inflammation uh maybe</p><p>those symptoms so if those symptoms go</p><p>away</p><p>chances are you&rsquo;re good so you put it</p><p>right back in remission you you know</p><p>when there are</p><p>and</p><p>when your body changes and it gets</p><p>stressed out the some of the bad</p><p>good bacteria turn</p><p>bad on you some of the microbes that</p><p>have been neutral in this relationship</p><p>they don&rsquo;t harm us they don&rsquo;t hurt us</p><p>they start turning nasty so they&rsquo;re</p><p>they&rsquo;re called opportunistic they take</p><p>advantage of a situation they kind of</p><p>kick you when you&rsquo;re down</p><p>because they um so unfortunately</p><p>probably happens in life the same way</p><p>but</p><p>i would just work on putting the acid</p><p>back in the stomach cleaning up the diet</p><p>and</p><p>if you have no symptoms</p><p>don&rsquo;t worry about it</p><p>wonderful okay doc i have another</p><p>question and these are a couple of</p><p>acronyms is it fair for you to spell</p><p>that out i&rsquo;ll leave that</p><p>to you or is that part of the quiz okay</p><p>so what is a better exercise</p><p>high intensity interval training or low</p><p>intensity</p><p>steady state and basically it&rsquo;s we&rsquo;re</p><p>comparing the high intensity interval</p><p>training to um something that&rsquo;s like low</p><p>intensity moderate endurance like you&rsquo;re</p><p>walking on a treadmill something like</p><p>that</p><p>what is uh better for you</p><p>okay</p><p>dig into that folks and why don&rsquo;t we go</p><p>back to our green room and um</p><p>i&rsquo;m watching their faces and joseph</p><p>seems to be the most patient of all of</p><p>them so with that comes rewards</p><p>uh joseph you&rsquo;re on with dr berg</p><p>uh forget don&rsquo;t forget to unmute</p><p>yourself sir</p><p>hi dr berg thank you for having me</p><p>um i&rsquo;ve had health issues for a couple</p><p>years and about 10 months ago</p><p>i figured out it was</p><p>high levels of heavy metal metals and</p><p>chemicals</p><p>some new intermittent fasting keto</p><p>dsma activated charcoal sweating</p><p>but i&rsquo;ve taken some tests during that</p><p>time leaky gut food sensitivity and a</p><p>bacteria test</p><p>the</p><p>bacteria test the normal stuff was okay</p><p>but for the opportunistic like</p><p>pseudomonas and staph they&rsquo;re really</p><p>high</p><p>i&rsquo;m not sensitive to dairy on when i</p><p>took</p><p>the test but um</p><p>i i noticed that it does exasperate my</p><p>symptoms so i want to know what you</p><p>thought about kefir if that was</p><p>a good probiotic considering i</p><p>have leaky gut and i&rsquo;m sort of</p><p>overcoming this stuff and what if that&rsquo;s</p><p>good and what else i might do</p><p>great question because i&rsquo;m just very</p><p>interested in this whole microbial thing</p><p>um yeah you&rsquo;re smart because um</p><p>one way to counteract some of the heavy</p><p>metals is to build up your own flora and</p><p>your gut that really helps</p><p>to um help keep things at a minimum and</p><p>um i think um</p><p>if you can</p><p>if you in your state what what state do</p><p>you are you from</p><p>nevada okay so</p><p>um</p><p>i would seek out go to realmilk.com to</p><p>see if you can find a farm that has the</p><p>raw milk and make your own kefir there&rsquo;s</p><p>a huge difference between buying kefir</p><p>and making it yourself with a starter</p><p>kit and using raw milk there are things</p><p>in the raw milk um when you make this</p><p>kefir that um</p><p>seem to bypass like people that have</p><p>allergies and sensitivities and</p><p>intolerances to things</p><p>so i would at least try it</p><p>because the kefir is hands down like one</p><p>of the best probiotics i mean it has a</p><p>wide range of the yeast and the bacteria</p><p>and you could take some of that now</p><p>so let&rsquo;s say that doesn&rsquo;t work</p><p>you have uh you know kimchi and</p><p>sauerkraut those two are are really</p><p>important um a good probiotic you can</p><p>get a spore</p><p>probiotic which is a kind of a</p><p>um it&rsquo;s a microbe in dormancy just like</p><p>in my greenhouse right now</p><p>i&rsquo;m not growing anything right now</p><p>because it&rsquo;s like too hot and so these</p><p>microbes i&rsquo;m not watering them they&rsquo;re</p><p>in a spore as soon as i have water boom</p><p>they become alive so same thing with the</p><p>spore of microbes you can take them and</p><p>they tend to</p><p>be better than the ones that might</p><p>already be dead when you take them</p><p>so yeah that&rsquo;s what i would i would do</p><p>and um</p><p>sauerkraut is like the best</p><p>okay</p><p>great thank you doctor sure no problem</p><p>thanks so much uh joseph appreciate</p><p>having you on i&rsquo;m just teasing the rest</p><p>of you all look very mature and patient</p><p>so i&rsquo;m just having some fun here but</p><p>thank you for that joseph and we hope</p><p>that you would call us back as we do all</p><p>of you</p><p>to let us know your progress and you</p><p>know how things are going for you</p><p>so let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s go back to well how</p><p>about a quiz question</p><p>um</p><p>number two</p><p>uh asked and of course i didn&rsquo;t</p><p>understand the thing which is better</p><p>high intensity training or low intensity</p><p>i guess sustained training or something</p><p>correct me if i&rsquo;m wrong dr berg but the</p><p>audience understood it oops sorry ma&rsquo;am</p><p>i didn&rsquo;t mean to bring you up quite yet</p><p>and um</p><p>80 percent say hit</p><p>and 20 say list</p><p>okay</p><p>it&rsquo;s a trick question uh they&rsquo;re both</p><p>they have their own</p><p>uh purposes you know we always you know</p><p>i&rsquo;m bringing this up because um i get</p><p>this question a lot like um</p><p>you know like well should i do this or</p><p>that i think you should do both of them</p><p>because there&rsquo;s benefits on each side</p><p>like for example the low intensity can</p><p>actually lower cortisol the high</p><p>intensity can increase cortisol so um</p><p>plus both of those exercises don&rsquo;t</p><p>really work on your flexibility</p><p>um</p><p>range of motion as much as was i like to</p><p>do workouts with that as well so i think</p><p>a combination of both also the um you</p><p>know with the high intensity interval</p><p>training you&rsquo;re going to get more growth</p><p>hormone you might get a little bit more</p><p>fat burning but the low intensity um</p><p>works on the blood sugars a little bit</p><p>better</p><p>the advantage with the high intensity</p><p>you can have um</p><p>it&rsquo;s for those people that don&rsquo;t have a</p><p>lot of time</p><p>and uh you like to just get in and out</p><p>and i but i think a little bit of both</p><p>is good because um</p><p>i can&rsquo;t just do a low intensity workout</p><p>i have to personally do something high</p><p>intensity and sometimes i push to the</p><p>limit like i did two days ago which</p><p>um i could barely walk right now but um</p><p>so that&rsquo;s uh</p><p>being said um i hope that answered the</p><p>question and as we&rsquo;re proceeding if</p><p>terry could go ahead and see if there&rsquo;s</p><p>any answers of the original question</p><p>that i asked about</p><p>people that are just beginning or</p><p>experienced with keto</p><p>good we&rsquo;ll get the whole team on that</p><p>and let&rsquo;s see here&rsquo;s an interesting</p><p>question carl is asking i&rsquo;ve just</p><p>started an active exercise program is it</p><p>best to skip workouts for a couple of</p><p>days while i&rsquo;m faster fasting excuse me</p><p>or does that matter</p><p>so it&rsquo;s if you could work out while</p><p>you&rsquo;re fasting you&rsquo;re going to add a lot</p><p>more benefit but</p><p>how do you know if you can handle</p><p>exercise when you&rsquo;re fasting</p><p>well you do it you work out and see if</p><p>you can maintain your same amount of</p><p>energy if you can</p><p>then you&rsquo;ve adapted your body can when</p><p>you&rsquo;re working out the problem with</p><p>workouts when you&rsquo;re fasting is you&rsquo;re</p><p>you&rsquo;re tapping into your fat and you</p><p>have to be adapted to your fat or else</p><p>you might just um</p><p>you know run out of sugar and then</p><p>because you&rsquo;re not adapted yet to</p><p>ketosis and then get really tired</p><p>so if you could maintain the same level</p><p>of energy level of energy i would</p><p>definitely work out while you&rsquo;re fasting</p><p>the brain doesn&rsquo;t need to adapt to</p><p>ketosis</p><p>it can it it can use ketones</p><p>or sugar</p><p>like that like no um</p><p>no adaptation so um it&rsquo;s the survival</p><p>mechanism because you need to have to do</p><p>that so</p><p>if</p><p>if you actually put ketones in your</p><p>blood</p><p>versus sugar</p><p>the the brain will always choose the</p><p>ketones before the sugar so</p><p>um</p><p>one thing when you&rsquo;re starting keto and</p><p>people</p><p>have um</p><p>headaches and things like that or side</p><p>effects</p><p>that&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;s a good time to add the</p><p>mct oil to add more ketones so the brain</p><p>feels better and that way you don&rsquo;t have</p><p>any</p><p>you know problems symptomatic with that</p><p>but um</p><p>but there is no adaptation for your</p><p>brain your brain can just</p><p>suck up those ketones or sugar um back</p><p>and forth</p><p>and um</p><p>so i just wanted to throw that extra</p><p>thing in there very good zee shan uh</p><p>from our social media gang can you</p><p>please tell me how to address</p><p>hashimoto&rsquo;s thyroidism</p><p>that is an autoimmune hypothyroid case</p><p>and and i think the best remedy for that</p><p>is selenium</p><p>and lots of vitamin d because it&rsquo;s</p><p>autoimmune so you take about 30</p><p>maybe even 40 000 ius of vitamin d3</p><p>to help reduce inflammation</p><p>and of course you know</p><p>fasting is going to be really important</p><p>for any autoimmune</p><p>problem because that&rsquo;s going to</p><p>strengthen your immune system</p><p>microbial diversity you&rsquo;ll have more</p><p>microbes in different types</p><p>so um</p><p>that&rsquo;s what i would do</p><p>very good okay coming from india watai i</p><p>guess that&rsquo;s her non-degear</p><p>but from india wants to know can you</p><p>please discuss the best way to address</p><p>gastritis caused by h pylori</p><p>licorice root is a good remedy</p><p>also</p><p>marshmallow root is a good one but not</p><p>marshmallows</p><p>the other thing that&rsquo;s good is the</p><p>wheatgrass juice powder is really good</p><p>for um</p><p>gastritis</p><p>and also</p><p>you know you might</p><p>think that it&rsquo;s coming from this h</p><p>pylori and it might be</p><p>but you can also have gastritis from</p><p>[Music]</p><p>bile backing up into the stomach</p><p>so just</p><p>if that&rsquo;s happening</p><p>you don&rsquo;t want to be taking bile cells</p><p>um you want to you might want to take</p><p>tucker just to kind of keep the flow</p><p>going but</p><p>then don&rsquo;t take it because you have it&rsquo;s</p><p>not draining properly so in that case</p><p>you want to do like some manual type</p><p>therapy to kind of allow it to drain</p><p>through there a little bit better</p><p>very good okay uh why don&rsquo;t we we&rsquo;re</p><p>really staying ahead of the questions</p><p>and these are interesting doc here&rsquo;s the</p><p>next one</p><p>all right so</p><p>which is more common in sinus congestion</p><p>viral or bacterial infections</p><p>all right dig into that audience i know</p><p>you will</p><p>and let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s go back to social</p><p>media again</p><p>um oh here we go macy from youtube</p><p>what&rsquo;s the best vitamin or best foods to</p><p>reduce stress increase energy and</p><p>sustain focus</p><p>well there&rsquo;s no there&rsquo;s no uh lag on</p><p>that answer because it&rsquo;s b1 b1 is</p><p>hands down the best</p><p>vitamin for stress anxiety nervous</p><p>tension</p><p>restless leg syndrome</p><p>um</p><p>i mean you&rsquo;ll feel difference within</p><p>probably a few minutes you&rsquo;ll just feel</p><p>like relief</p><p>so be one</p><p>wow is the answer to that well i know</p><p>you don&rsquo;t uh push your products on the</p><p>air and that&rsquo;s very admirable but but i</p><p>don&rsquo;t mind doing it what do you have it</p><p>has b1 in it do you have any</p><p>recommendations out of your list of</p><p>things i have a i have a natural b1</p><p>supplement now i finally got that in as</p><p>well as the nutritional yeast</p><p>so both of those have the b1 very good</p><p>um you know it&rsquo;s really hard to find a</p><p>natural b1 um but we found one</p><p>um unfortunately it&rsquo;s really hard to</p><p>make uh but</p><p>most of the b1 out there is just pure</p><p>synthetic from petroleum and um i i just</p><p>there&rsquo;s just not much attention being</p><p>put on the source of where you get these</p><p>ingredients and the vitamins so that&rsquo;s</p><p>where my head is at um</p><p>finding sources that are really good and</p><p>soils that are really healthy good well</p><p>i&rsquo;m glad you reminded me the nutritional</p><p>yeast as b1 i&rsquo;m a fan of that of course</p><p>able from youtube is biotin good to</p><p>treat flaky skin what else might help</p><p>it can</p><p>it can for sure but it&rsquo;s biotin is also</p><p>good for your um</p><p>your hair</p><p>growth hair splitting</p><p>the strength of hair</p><p>um some of the biotin is coming from</p><p>your gut so</p><p>but</p><p>a better remedy would be</p><p>um</p><p>the omega</p><p>3</p><p>fatty acid like the cod liver oil</p><p>and limit the omega-6 fatty acids so</p><p>how do you do that well you just don&rsquo;t</p><p>go out to eat for a while because every</p><p>single restaurant is going to give you</p><p>these omega-6 fatty acids and that will</p><p>lead to this imbalance where you have</p><p>inflammation the skin flaky dry red</p><p>skin i can even look at someone their</p><p>skin and tell you what they&rsquo;ve been</p><p>eating</p><p>um you know but then they&rsquo;re at the</p><p>local restaurant eating</p><p>probably chicken wings or something</p><p>fried and</p><p>they don&rsquo;t realize how that&rsquo;s affecting</p><p>the skin</p><p>well you indeed you are what you eat i</p><p>guess so</p><p>and the audience is eating up these</p><p>questions and they&rsquo;ve already got an</p><p>answer to the last one which asks which</p><p>is more common</p><p>uh in sinus congestion virus or bacteria</p><p>and the audience</p><p>has an opinion sixty percent say it&rsquo;s</p><p>viral thirty percent say it&rsquo;s bacterial</p><p>and ten percent uh are hedging their</p><p>bats and say it&rsquo;s both</p><p>okay so</p><p>the great majority of sinus infections</p><p>is viral</p><p>sometimes but rarely it&rsquo;s bacteria this</p><p>is why the antibiotics for a sinus</p><p>infection</p><p>rarely are just it&rsquo;s just a waste now</p><p>you also can have uh what&rsquo;s common is</p><p>fungal affections if it&rsquo;s a chronic</p><p>sinus you&rsquo;re around</p><p>i will us release the video on that this</p><p>week as well</p><p>uh some really good remedies to use to</p><p>if you have sinus congestion which yeah</p><p>boy that&rsquo;s uh you know it can really</p><p>affect you know your sleeping snoring</p><p>getting up but mainly oxygen at night</p><p>when you&rsquo;re trying to sleep because um</p><p>you can&rsquo;t breathe you breathe through</p><p>your mouth</p><p>and then you don&rsquo;t get the air and then</p><p>you don&rsquo;t wake up feeling</p><p>bright-eyed and bushy-tailed</p><p>wow that&rsquo;s interesting well i gave</p><p>everybody a sneak peek of susan from</p><p>manitoba accidentally so we might as</p><p>well bring her on the air and susan if</p><p>you would unmute yourself you&rsquo;re now</p><p>officially on the dr berg show</p><p>hi thank you very much for having me</p><p>um i&rsquo;m in my 60s</p><p>i come from a family with</p><p>high cholesterol so it&rsquo;s from a low</p><p>hypercholesterolemia</p><p>um mine is the highest in my family</p><p>i&rsquo;ve been on statins since my 20s</p><p>currently on rosuvastatin 20 milligrams</p><p>which i</p><p>i really want to stop taking but my</p><p>endocrinologist would wouldn&rsquo;t hear it</p><p>um so you know family history of</p><p>heart attack and stroke um</p><p>i was eating a low-fat diet for many</p><p>years and i&rsquo;m so glad to</p><p>want to eat the fats but i&rsquo;m a bit</p><p>conflicted with regards to the keto and</p><p>not handling um</p><p>stopping eating for a while you know</p><p>fasting is</p><p>not so easy</p><p>but i&rsquo;ve cut back on the snacking</p><p>so</p><p>you know you&rsquo;ve got one approach which i</p><p>appreciate um things are different</p><p>around here up in canada</p><p>and</p><p>you know the dietetics</p><p>diabetic association because i have</p><p>diabetes as well</p><p>um</p><p>they say all the other stuff which i&rsquo;m</p><p>not happy with</p><p>yeah</p><p>i know i hear you and i know exactly</p><p>some direction would be</p><p>yes i totally</p><p>understand that and uh</p><p>wow i mean there&rsquo;s so many um</p><p>official organizations that are putting</p><p>you on a diet that&rsquo;s</p><p>low fat</p><p>high carb</p><p>high grain soy blah blah blah so this is</p><p>what um i have i&rsquo;ve had other people</p><p>with even a genetic high cholesterol um</p><p>be able to do this</p><p>and bring the cholesterol down i think</p><p>would be very important</p><p>is to do what i&rsquo;m going to tell you and</p><p>then go back and get an advanced</p><p>well actually no</p><p>i would get an advanced lipid profile</p><p>test first</p><p>and just see where your numbers are and</p><p>i&rsquo;m talking about looking at all these</p><p>little factors related to cholesterol</p><p>not just total cholesterol but all the</p><p>all the data</p><p>and then</p><p>do what i&rsquo;m going to tell you and then</p><p>go back</p><p>maybe two months later and recheck it</p><p>and then you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll know for sure</p><p>what you can handle that way there&rsquo;s no</p><p>mystery but</p><p>um so if you have a problem with this</p><p>cholesterol</p><p>genetically</p><p>then you&rsquo;re going to have to take um</p><p>like tutca which is a bile salt on a</p><p>regular basis that will keep the</p><p>cholesterol</p><p>mobile and moving through your body</p><p>also choline is another good</p><p>cholesterol thing that breaks down</p><p>cholesterol and then niacin which not</p><p>only will help your cholesterol that</p><p>will help protect the heart with one</p><p>more little thing and that&rsquo;s tocatrinals</p><p>and that would be a type of vitamin e</p><p>that&rsquo;s</p><p>hands down it&rsquo;s</p><p>like 50 times stronger than the regular</p><p>tocopherols so called tocotrienols but</p><p>it protects the inside lining of your</p><p>arteries so that way even if there is</p><p>high cholesterol you have this</p><p>antioxidant that can uh kind of mop up</p><p>any type of uh free radicals and</p><p>inflammation and damage that&rsquo;s going on</p><p>so um</p><p>the the most important thing though for</p><p>you is to really keep your carbs low so</p><p>even though you probably haven&rsquo;t been</p><p>doing that but that&rsquo;s because those</p><p>these carbs they actually convert to</p><p>cholesterol the bad kind of cholesterol</p><p>that&rsquo;s really sticky and it&rsquo;s oxidized</p><p>and of course</p><p>one last little tip and that&rsquo;s just you</p><p>know you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p><p>the type of fat that um really need to</p><p>avoid is the uh the the vegetable oils</p><p>like that&rsquo;s really like bad stuff so</p><p>maybe you just uh you do keto but you</p><p>just don&rsquo;t add a lot of extra fat and</p><p>then the fat that you do add would be</p><p>like um</p><p>olive oil and you know a lot of</p><p>fish oil because fish oil will not</p><p>create a problem it&rsquo;s a unique type of</p><p>oil</p><p>so that should keep you busy for a few</p><p>days</p><p>um thank you you mentioned the bio salt</p><p>yeah yeah i didn&rsquo;t get the name of the</p><p>bio salt that you mentioned</p><p>yeah it&rsquo;s called tudka</p><p>t-u-d-c-a</p><p>and tutca is a</p><p>a very unique type of bile salt that</p><p>can really bring down your cholesterol</p><p>um</p><p>yeah</p><p>because cholesterol i mean bile is the</p><p>the primary uh controller thank you very</p><p>much you&rsquo;re welcome so it controls</p><p>cholesterol so</p><p>uh anytime you have higher cholesterol</p><p>maybe you need more bile and so a lot of</p><p>people do</p><p>but they didn&rsquo;t realize it until they</p><p>tried it and then also that worked</p><p>well that&rsquo;s terrific well thank you</p><p>susan for joining us from manitoba</p><p>representing them so well and let&rsquo;s see</p><p>uh oh this is interesting uh name anyway</p><p>it caused me to look at it the crunchy</p><p>pancake i have some serious acne scars</p><p>on my face how can i get rid of them or</p><p>at least make them less visible</p><p>so these are acne scars yeah so he must</p><p>be beyond the initial deal</p><p>you can you can you definitely use</p><p>vitamin e oil rub it in each night</p><p>before i go to bed that&rsquo;s a really good</p><p>tip and then the other thing is there&rsquo;s</p><p>a product from standard process it&rsquo;s</p><p>called dermatrophin pmg</p><p>dermatrophy pmg from standard process</p><p>you can seek out that product and just</p><p>take take one before bed for</p><p>probably three months</p><p>and uh that seems to work good as well</p><p>very good abigail from facebook what can</p><p>i do to get uh relief from a food</p><p>allergy i suspect it was salmon and now</p><p>i have a sore throat and swollen lips</p><p>well</p><p>i mean the the best thing if you want to</p><p>reduce</p><p>the reaction</p><p>to that allergy right now like i would</p><p>take a lot of vitamin d but to get rid</p><p>of the allergy i would do periodic</p><p>prolonged fasting so</p><p>like every week you do 48 hour fasting</p><p>and then every month you do</p><p>like a longer fasting more than three</p><p>days</p><p>and then that will</p><p>greatly improve your immune system and</p><p>it may even get rid of your allergies</p><p>very good well here&rsquo;s our first true</p><p>falsehood of the day and they&rsquo;re really</p><p>fun because you have a 50 chance of</p><p>being smart and here it is</p><p>all right the average person in the u.s</p><p>drinks 25</p><p>of their liquids as a soft drink</p><p>is that true or false</p><p>wow</p><p>i&rsquo;m not sure coca-cola is going to like</p><p>you asking that question uh anyway let&rsquo;s</p><p>see let&rsquo;s move on from that and let&rsquo;s go</p><p>back to the green room and in this case</p><p>uh shannon and her family is chattering</p><p>away in the background i think which is</p><p>so wonderful has a question for you dr</p><p>berg and here she is</p><p>go ahead shannon hi dr berg</p><p>hi</p><p>my family just left so it should be</p><p>quiet now</p><p>so my question it&rsquo;s probably i think</p><p>it&rsquo;s a common question that you get but</p><p>i&rsquo;ve been doing this for a year my</p><p>husband&rsquo;s been doing it for five months</p><p>and we can&rsquo;t seem to get it right</p><p>electrolytes and leg cramps and diarrhea</p><p>sorry too much information but um so my</p><p>husband has to have like five scoops of</p><p>your electrolytes a day to avoid having</p><p>leg cramps and that seems excessive to</p><p>me but i don&rsquo;t know</p><p>and for me the balance is if i</p><p>if i take one scoop i get leg cramps but</p><p>if i eat two soups i seem to get loose</p><p>bowels so</p><p>not sure how to get a happy medium it&rsquo;s</p><p>been a year and i feel like i was i was</p><p>actually vegan for 10 years before this</p><p>i feel so much better doing keto</p><p>everything is great except for for me</p><p>the bad issues um that i&rsquo;ve never had</p><p>before i never had loose stools ever in</p><p>my life until now so</p><p>yeah so it&rsquo;s kind of a twofold it&rsquo;s a</p><p>question for both of us but it&rsquo;s kind of</p><p>a similar yeah</p><p>well i mean i think this is this is</p><p>normal because you&rsquo;re married and</p><p>everything usually is opposite i mean</p><p>like</p><p>my wife likes it warmer i like it cold</p><p>when i&rsquo;m sleeping so it&rsquo;s a perfect</p><p>so of course um i&rsquo;m surprised it doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>cause uh</p><p>constipation on his side but</p><p>okay interesting</p><p>um yeah it&rsquo;s just a normal part of being</p><p>married um that&rsquo;s really what&rsquo;s going on</p><p>but i think if you um</p><p>cut down you probably don&rsquo;t need</p><p>more than</p><p>a half of a scoop maybe a fourth of a</p><p>scoop</p><p>and then just</p><p>you know eat really good</p><p>as far as your husband um the thing</p><p>about uh the electrolytes that i have um</p><p>with some people i don&rsquo;t know what his</p><p>diet was in the past but um some people</p><p>do need</p><p>a lot more if like think about like one</p><p>scoop is 1 000 milligrams we need 4 700</p><p>milligrams but that&rsquo;s just the rda</p><p>that&rsquo;s recommended</p><p>there&rsquo;s some data that shows that</p><p>um</p><p>from an evolutionary point of view that</p><p>we need like 11 000</p><p>um milligrams a day</p><p>um so that&rsquo;s uh so i i don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s</p><p>a problem um if that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s working</p><p>for him realize our bodies have a very</p><p>uh convenient way of getting rid of</p><p>excess potassium if we don&rsquo;t need it so</p><p>it&rsquo;s not like a dangerous thing at all</p><p>unless you have stage five</p><p>kidney failure which he doesn&rsquo;t i highly</p><p>doubt if he does um so um</p><p>the thing about this our body is trying</p><p>to conserve sodium but not potassium</p><p>so um</p><p>he&rsquo;s his body&rsquo;s getting rid of anything</p><p>he doesn&rsquo;t need</p><p>but um but you know some people require</p><p>a lot more</p><p>potassium i&rsquo;m going to do an experiment</p><p>and i&rsquo;ll put this in a video</p><p>i&rsquo;m going to get a glass of distilled</p><p>water put some wires into it and</p><p>hook it up to a light bulb and you&rsquo;ll</p><p>see that it won&rsquo;t work until i add a</p><p>little electrolytes and then boom it</p><p>works so what we&rsquo;re doing is we&rsquo;re</p><p>adding more um</p><p>electrical um activity to the body</p><p>and um maybe that&rsquo;s what he needs</p><p>um but yeah so i wouldn&rsquo;t</p><p>i would just</p><p>reduce yours and just see you know see</p><p>just maybe work on his diet a little bit</p><p>more maybe he needs to have more salads</p><p>i don&rsquo;t know but um</p><p>oh then add some mct oil um that might</p><p>help and then also uh he probably needs</p><p>a good</p><p>probiotic</p><p>or some type of uh</p><p>keefe or something that can actually fix</p><p>the microbes that will help the um the</p><p>stool</p><p>okay</p><p>sounds great one last thing if you</p><p>haven&rsquo;t if you haven&rsquo;t seen my recent</p><p>video on constipation watch that one</p><p>because</p><p>peristalsis which is the pumping action</p><p>of colon</p><p>is controlled</p><p>by that thing that we talked about in</p><p>the very beginning of the show called</p><p>acetylcholine</p><p>and to build that up you need</p><p>vitamin b1 so he might need b1 for his</p><p>constipation so i did a whole video on</p><p>it um</p><p>it&rsquo;s uh i thought it was i&rsquo;ll go back</p><p>and watch a pretty good video so you can</p><p>check it out</p><p>awesome that&rsquo;s great videos are great</p><p>thank you so much</p><p>shannon thanks so much for joining us</p><p>let us know how you and your husband</p><p>uh do together uh challenge all across</p><p>the world let&rsquo;s see now um and dr berg</p><p>has a great heart for kids so let&rsquo;s go</p><p>to leset from</p><p>facebook my beautiful granddaughter is</p><p>ten but her face is already breaking out</p><p>what can i do for her</p><p>i wish i would have known um</p><p>back then what i know now because um</p><p>first of all i bet you anything</p><p>there&rsquo;s too much sugar and more carbs</p><p>and too much insulin which then converts</p><p>to androgens and then increases</p><p>acne and women so um i would</p><p>for young adults i would definitely just</p><p>go go to the standard eating plan and</p><p>cut down the sugars and for kids um get</p><p>alternative type sweets you know you</p><p>have the sugar alcohols make the</p><p>different keto bombs and different</p><p>recipes and that would be um</p><p>some good advice</p><p>and the key is starting your kids early</p><p>early as possible don&rsquo;t try to change it</p><p>after they hit 18 because it&rsquo;s uh it&rsquo;s</p><p>more difficult</p><p>so um</p><p>steve with you i know your kids are</p><p>grown up and it&rsquo;s uh</p><p>they don&rsquo;t they don&rsquo;t like to change as</p><p>much as</p><p>when they&rsquo;re younger so you&rsquo;re just</p><p>gonna have to start over and have some</p><p>new kids oh absolutely and especially if</p><p>any council comes from their father</p><p>that&rsquo;s the end of it</p><p>just a quick let me tell you something a</p><p>quick anecdote so uh my son uh alec and</p><p>my daughter was sitting at the dining</p><p>table and i just bought hooked on</p><p>phonics you know it was an 85 set to</p><p>teach your kid how to read early and</p><p>she&rsquo;s i don&rsquo;t know five or something and</p><p>i pulled it out and i said honey this is</p><p>a a and this is a lowercase a she said</p><p>uh-uh i said well no this is the</p><p>lowercase she goes no my teacher showed</p><p>us an a and there&rsquo;s no lowercase a so</p><p>i realized then i i quietly folded the</p><p>thing back up slid the lid on it and put</p><p>it away and then never return to it</p><p>again now she&rsquo;s now got a master&rsquo;s</p><p>degree is doing great but it wasn&rsquo;t</p><p>because of any counsel from her father</p><p>she just doesn&rsquo;t want to hear that from</p><p>me so but you know so there you go</p><p>okay so uh the audience has jumped on</p><p>this true false question which asks the</p><p>average person in the us drinks 25</p><p>percent of their liquids as soft drinks</p><p>65 percent of the audience says no way</p><p>it&rsquo;s false 35 unfortunately it&rsquo;s true</p><p>it&rsquo;s actually true isn&rsquo;t that crazy wow</p><p>that&rsquo;s crazy</p><p>yeah so that&rsquo;s uh i&rsquo;ll do a video on the</p><p>um more on that topic but i was just</p><p>like what the</p><p>um it&rsquo;s crazy and also um i&rsquo;ll talk a</p><p>bit more on like</p><p>what percentage of people consume like</p><p>the tap water and what&rsquo;s in tap water</p><p>but</p><p>you know</p><p>might be might be good to get a filter</p><p>but even at the very very bare minimum</p><p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s certain types of filters</p><p>and</p><p>things that you can use that are better</p><p>than others i will cover that as well</p><p>that&rsquo;s great we&rsquo;ve got a filter on our</p><p>fridge i hope it works the screw in type</p><p>anyway let&rsquo;s see um oh how about the</p><p>last question here doc it&rsquo;s an</p><p>interesting one</p><p>all right</p><p>what is the first symptom of a vitamin d</p><p>overdose</p><p>how do you know</p><p>you&rsquo;re taking too much vitamin d</p><p>is there any simple way of knowing that</p><p>what do you think about that</p><p>very good dig into that audience and now</p><p>let&rsquo;s go to mary who is from uh an oaky</p><p>from oklahoma and mary let me unreach</p><p>you on my end and you are on with dr</p><p>byrd</p><p>thank you thank you can you hear me</p><p>perfectly</p><p>okay</p><p>um</p><p>what i&rsquo;m having is i was wanting to talk</p><p>to you about i&rsquo;m having anemia</p><p>uh because i have a fibroid in my uterus</p><p>and it&rsquo;s been bleeding for like four</p><p>months it&rsquo;s getting worse but i&rsquo;m going</p><p>to get in you know i finally got into</p><p>the gynecologist that&rsquo;d be next month</p><p>and then after that they&rsquo;ll send me to</p><p>if they&rsquo;re going to do something about</p><p>it but</p><p>i&rsquo;m</p><p>only been on the program probably maybe</p><p>six seven weeks</p><p>and i love it i mean it just hit me just</p><p>perfect i mean</p><p>i don&rsquo;t have keto flu i&rsquo;ve never had any</p><p>you know side effects i just started</p><p>doing it</p><p>and then within a week i was already</p><p>fasting</p><p>so i was off and running</p><p>but</p><p>i&rsquo;m finding that</p><p>i&rsquo;m the fasting&rsquo;s not</p><p>so good for me because i feel like i&rsquo;m</p><p>going to faint all the time i feel like</p><p>i&rsquo;m going to faint</p><p>um i tried to add more nutrients</p><p>i take the electrolytes</p><p>but and i&rsquo;m not hungry</p><p>i&rsquo;m not hungry at breakfast i&rsquo;m not</p><p>hungry until like two three maybe if i&rsquo;m</p><p>even hungry because i have a job where i</p><p>can work straight through and not even</p><p>stop</p><p>wow um i can wait till dinner to eat</p><p>but</p><p>i yet i&rsquo;m</p><p>constantly like the room starts spinning</p><p>or</p><p>i&rsquo;ll just have to grab hold of something</p><p>because i know i&rsquo;m gonna faint and then</p><p>the logical</p><p>thing to do would be eat something you</p><p>know right so you don&rsquo;t faint right i</p><p>mean</p><p>i&rsquo;m just confused because i don&rsquo;t want</p><p>to eat anything but i know i know yeah</p><p>that&rsquo;s it so okay so this is what i</p><p>would try um</p><p>the next time you get dizzy um</p><p>take about</p><p>an eighth of a teaspoon of sea salt and</p><p>dissolve it in water and drink it and</p><p>see if that gets rid of your</p><p>dizziness</p><p>sea salt</p><p>that might be what you&rsquo;re missing</p><p>let&rsquo;s say that doesn&rsquo;t work you know you</p><p>don&rsquo;t feel any change at all if you feel</p><p>some change then it means you need to do</p><p>more of that but let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s no</p><p>change at all and you&rsquo;ve tried that a</p><p>couple times</p><p>then i would support the adrenal glands</p><p>because the adrenal glands might need</p><p>support there&rsquo;s uh something i have</p><p>called the</p><p>whole desiccated what&rsquo;s called adrenal</p><p>support but it&rsquo;s a desiccated adrenal</p><p>it&rsquo;s a</p><p>an actual extract that</p><p>it it kind of supports the adrenal</p><p>because one of the symptoms uh about</p><p>adrenal that needs supporting is</p><p>dizziness</p><p>um</p><p>sometimes low tolerance to stress not</p><p>that you have that but definitely</p><p>the dizziness</p><p>i love the fact that you&rsquo;re</p><p>you lost the appetite now we just need</p><p>to get handled that one symptom because</p><p>then you can go</p><p>longer and um things can really start to</p><p>happen</p><p>but uh yeah so</p><p>the most likely thing it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s sea salt</p><p>but then second you support the adrenal</p><p>um</p><p>so those are the two things i would i</p><p>would do right now</p><p>and if that doesn&rsquo;t work come back and i</p><p>will give you a third solution</p><p>all right that&rsquo;s so great well mary</p><p>thanks for joining us and thanks for</p><p>waiting so long in the room uh and s uh</p><p>stefan</p><p>uh from uh washington is our last</p><p>participant here and we&rsquo;re gonna bring</p><p>him on</p><p>and stephon go ahead with your question</p><p>hang on dr burke i&rsquo;ve got your shot all</p><p>screwed up here let&rsquo;s fix that oops</p><p>oh well here we go there you go dr berg</p><p>and stefan you&rsquo;re on with dr berg</p><p>hi dr berg first i want to thank you for</p><p>you uh completely revolutionized my</p><p>wife&rsquo;s health and my health i lost 55</p><p>pounds</p><p>her rheumatoid arthritis is</p><p>significantly improved wow and uh</p><p>it&rsquo;s people don&rsquo;t realize how easy it&rsquo;s</p><p>it&rsquo;s much easier to eat less frequently</p><p>instead of bothering all these dishes</p><p>and cooking three times a day or going</p><p>out my goodness i know i hear you it&rsquo;s</p><p>like your whole it&rsquo;s a whole life</p><p>revolving around these doing these</p><p>dishes and eating</p><p>i tell you i hear you</p><p>that&rsquo;s for sure</p><p>so</p><p>just a little bit of pertinent</p><p>medical history about 14 years ago i had</p><p>chemotherapy for testicular cancer</p><p>about a year ago</p><p>i had a gi procedure and they told me</p><p>that i had markers for gi inflammation</p><p>and so my current struggle is</p><p>i generally</p><p>it seems like forever now i&rsquo;ve had</p><p>floating stool</p><p>and uh sometimes fragmented i&rsquo;ve tried</p><p>many different types of probiotics and</p><p>and all the sauerkrauts you can eat and</p><p>it&rsquo;s persistent i was wonder i wanted to</p><p>know if you had any other ideas</p><p>yes yes i do um what&rsquo;s happening is um</p><p>you&rsquo;re getting um</p><p>the still floats it means that there&rsquo;s</p><p>fat in the stool</p><p>so that&rsquo;s not a lack of microbes that is</p><p>a lack of bile salts</p><p>so you need the bile salts</p><p>so you want to add the bile salts until</p><p>that improves</p><p>but</p><p>what happens when you eat is you have</p><p>this release of the bile salt and then</p><p>you also have the triggering of the</p><p>pancreas to release</p><p>an enzyme to help fully break down fats</p><p>so um the bile salts are</p><p>usually will handle that problem but</p><p>sometimes you have to add some enzymes</p><p>pancreatic enzymes so the combination of</p><p>those two i mean i&rsquo;m not saying that i&rsquo;m</p><p>not biased in my own gallbladder formula</p><p>but it does have</p><p>the bile salts and the enzymes and of</p><p>course that was a sarcasm but the thing</p><p>is that um that&rsquo;s really what you need</p><p>um</p><p>the other point i was gonna bring up</p><p>um</p><p>is just uh and i&rsquo;m sure i have tried</p><p>those</p><p>i did try your product and i and it</p><p>didn&rsquo;t seem to help okay so if you try</p><p>the my product maybe</p><p>i did it wrong i don&rsquo;t know</p><p>he was taking it after eating</p><p>yeah</p><p>okay so if you still have some take more</p><p>of it and if it still doesn&rsquo;t work for</p><p>some reason then we know</p><p>what you need to do is you need to find</p><p>some enzymes some um you know pancreatic</p><p>enzymes and start doing that because</p><p>it&rsquo;s either it&rsquo;s either the bile or</p><p>enzymes one of the two</p><p>but</p><p>um</p><p>you know when you don&rsquo;t have either one</p><p>of those you can have like a floating</p><p>school a stool uh skid marks in the</p><p>toilet there&rsquo;s a whole series of things</p><p>that can happen</p><p>um</p><p>but um i would</p><p>do that and then if that fully doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>handle it you just come back and let&rsquo;s</p><p>uh let&rsquo;s take it one step further</p><p>because</p><p>you know what i&rsquo;m trying to do in the</p><p>show is just to give people tips on</p><p>things but</p><p>sometimes you have to get more</p><p>information and test things out and uh</p><p>but most of the time</p><p>the most likely thing is just to try the</p><p>bile salts and</p><p>not just one probably two or three after</p><p>a meal especially if it&rsquo;s a big problem</p><p>okay</p><p>i&rsquo;ll give it a try</p><p>awesome thank you great for your results</p><p>i love it that&rsquo;s awesome great thanks</p><p>stefan and again as we always say please</p><p>get back with us and let us know uh you</p><p>know uh your progress because dr berg is</p><p>very interested in all that</p><p>and let&rsquo;s see quiz question number five</p><p>we got to all of them today because of</p><p>the</p><p>vigorous attention the audience gave</p><p>them and the last one asks what is the</p><p>symptom of vitamin d uh</p><p>overdose and drumroll</p><p>55 say joint pain 30 say elevated</p><p>calcium levels and 15 say loose bowel or</p><p>frequent urination</p><p>okay so</p><p>um what happens with vitamin d is that</p><p>without vitamin d you can only really</p><p>absorb 10 of the calcium from your food</p><p>with vitamin d you increase that by 20x</p><p>so you really start extracting calcium</p><p>from the food that you eat and it gets</p><p>absorbed into the blood and so if you&rsquo;re</p><p>having too much vitamin d</p><p>you&rsquo;re going to have too much calcium</p><p>and that&rsquo;s going to show up as</p><p>calcification now in a woman it might</p><p>show up as a little calcification spots</p><p>on in the breast</p><p>it could show up as calcification on</p><p>your teeth is tartar it could show up as</p><p>calcification um</p><p>and the um</p><p>kidney you know but it&rsquo;s really just too</p><p>much calcium you might feel the joints</p><p>it&rsquo;s stiffness</p><p>but</p><p>if you</p><p>reduce</p><p>your um</p><p>i&rsquo;m sorry if you add in some additional</p><p>helper um</p><p>nutrients like vitamin k</p><p>and zinc</p><p>and</p><p>magnesium</p><p>then you reduce dramatically</p><p>the</p><p>collateral damage from that and also if</p><p>you drink</p><p>2.5 liters of fluid you completely just</p><p>rule out or eliminate the risk for</p><p>kidney stones so</p><p>there&rsquo;s some really cool things that you</p><p>can do and i will release a video on</p><p>that but um</p><p>you know people are concerned about</p><p>taking ten thousand i used to vitamin d3</p><p>but you&rsquo;re gonna find out in this new</p><p>video</p><p>that the real dangers occur when you&rsquo;re</p><p>taking</p><p>hundreds of thousands of international</p><p>units of vitamin d3</p><p>and sometimes even a million</p><p>ius of vitamin d3</p><p>so um</p><p>you know most people can handle</p><p>thirty thousand i use</p><p>for a hundred months</p><p>without getting any symptoms so anyway i</p><p>think that&rsquo;ll be a good video to release</p><p>um</p><p>maybe this next week very good by the</p><p>way we really didn&rsquo;t get any responses</p><p>from the audience on how long they&rsquo;ve</p><p>been on the keto diet and that&rsquo;s a</p><p>couple of experts have been digging</p><p>through the comments so maybe there&rsquo;s</p><p>another way we could po pose that but</p><p>audience uh if you didn&rsquo;t answer let&rsquo;s</p><p>re why don&rsquo;t you restate that doc and</p><p>just see if they&rsquo;ll do it after the fact</p><p>and we can get some stuff oh yeah um yes</p><p>all i need to know is i&rsquo;d just like to</p><p>know like are you new to keto like have</p><p>you never tried keto or have you</p><p>experienced with keto that&rsquo;s all i want</p><p>to know because i&rsquo;m just</p><p>curious who do we have listening um</p><p>it would be very helpful i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m</p><p>assuming i&rsquo;m assuming that</p><p>probably everyone has been on keto but</p><p>i&rsquo;d like to really know for sure all</p><p>right well that uh you would have asked</p><p>during the show but that&rsquo;s wrapped so</p><p>this becomes your homework assignment</p><p>and doc maybe last week you can always</p><p>comment and you can i can watch this um</p><p>later i can watch in post production</p><p>because you could add add the comments</p><p>if you talk within the next 30 seconds</p><p>and of course um</p><p>you know this next uh</p><p>week</p><p>of videos lined up you know</p><p>i get a lot of great uh feedback on</p><p>ideas on new videos that i do research</p><p>uh and i&rsquo;m putting a lot of time in</p><p>these research just to come up with a</p><p>lot of the background and data so i</p><p>think you&rsquo;ll appreciate it you&rsquo;ll like</p><p>it</p><p>and</p><p>definitely apply the information spread</p><p>it around your friends and family</p><p>members</p><p>as you&rsquo;re already doing</p><p>but um</p><p>yeah it&rsquo;s interesting when you when you</p><p>get helped with something and the</p><p>natural thing is like you want to help</p><p>someone someone else so that&rsquo;s like a</p><p>that&rsquo;s really the thing for me is if i&rsquo;m</p><p>not helping a lot of people</p><p>of course i go into severe depression by</p><p>the way let me interject they are</p><p>killing it with answers on that thank</p><p>you audience i mean they&rsquo;re just</p><p>spraying by so there&rsquo;s a whole ton of</p><p>information on who people who&rsquo;s new to</p><p>keto and so on</p><p>and uh so there you have it yeah i think</p><p>that&rsquo;ll be uh valuable just to</p><p>you know i might have to reword my</p><p>questions my answers because</p><p>you know i mean</p><p>i just assume everyone</p><p>pretty much has watched all my videos</p><p>but they probably haven&rsquo;t so</p><p>there you have it well doctor take us</p><p>out no i won&rsquo;t</p><p>what&rsquo;s that steve i&rsquo;m sorry i was just</p><p>saying take us out i didn&rsquo;t need to tell</p><p>you that</p><p>we&rsquo;re done yeah so thank you have a</p><p>wonderful weekend and</p><p>i appreciate</p><p>all your wonderful comments so i will</p><p>see you next week</p><p>[Music]</p><p>you</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
