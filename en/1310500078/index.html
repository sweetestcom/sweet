    <p>The following is a conversation with Anne Drouin, writer, producer, director, and one</p>
<p>of the most important and impactful communicators of science in our time.</p>
<p>She co wrote the 1980 science documentary series Cosmos hosted by Carl Sagan, whom she</p>
<p>married in 1981 and her love for whom, with the help of NASA, was recorded as brainwaves</p>
<p>on a golden record along with other things our civilization has to offer and launched</p>
<p>into space on the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft that are now, 42 years later, still</p>
<p>active, reaching out farther into deep space than any human made object ever has.</p>
<p>This was a profound and beautiful decision Anne made as the creative director of NASA&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Voyager Interstellar Message Project.</p>
<p>In 2014 she went on to create the second season of Cosmos, called Cosmos A Space Time Odyssey,</p>
<p>in 2020 the new third season called Cosmos Possible Worlds, which is being released this</p>
<p>upcoming Monday, March 9th.</p>
<p>It is hosted, once again, by the fun and the brilliant Neil deGrasse Tyson.</p>
<p>Carl Sagan, Anne Drouin, and Cosmos have inspired millions of scientists and curious minds across</p>
<p>several generations by revealing the magic, the power, the beauty of science.</p>
<p>I am one such curious mind, and if you listened to this podcast, you may know that Elon Musk</p>
<p>is as well.</p>
<p>He graciously agreed to read Carl Sagan&rsquo;s words about the pale blue dot in my second</p>
<p>conversation with him.</p>
<p>If you listened, there was an interesting and inspiring twist at the end.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast, if you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, give</p>
<p>it 5 stars on Apple Podcast, support it on Patreon, or connect with me on Twitter at</p>
<p>Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.</p>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;ll do one or two minutes of ads now and never any ads in the middle that</p>
<p>can break the flow of the conversation.</p>
<p>I hope that works for you and doesn&rsquo;t hurt the listening experience.</p>
<p>This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store.</p>
<p>When you get it, use code LEX PODCAST.</p>
<p>Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with</p>
<p>as little as $1.</p>
<p>Since Cash App allows you to send and receive money digitally, peer to peer, and security</p>
<p>in all digital transactions is very important, let me mention the PCI data security standard</p>
<p>that Cash App is compliant with.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of standards for safety and security.</p>
<p>PCI DSS is a good example of that, where a bunch of competitors got together and agreed</p>
<p>that there needs to be a global standard around the security of transactions.</p>
<p>Now we just need to do the same for autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence systems</p>
<p>in general.</p>
<p>So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play, and use the code LEX</p>
<p>PODCAST, you get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST, one of my favorite organizations</p>
<p>that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Anne Drouin.</p>
<p>What is the role of science in our society?</p>
<p>Well, I think of what Einstein said when he opened the 1939 New York World&rsquo;s Fair.</p>
<p>He said, if science is ever to fulfill its mission the way art has done, it must penetrate.</p>
<p>Its inner meaning must penetrate the consciousness of everyone.</p>
<p>And so for me, especially in a civilization dependent on high technology and science,</p>
<p>one that aspires to be democratic, it&rsquo;s critical that the public, as informed decision makers,</p>
<p>understand the values and the methods and the rules of science.</p>
<p>So you think about what you just mentioned, the values and the methods and the rules and</p>
<p>maybe the technology that science produces, but what about sort of the beauty, the mystery</p>
<p>of science?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ve touched on what I think is for me, that&rsquo;s how my way into science is that</p>
<p>for me, it&rsquo;s much more spiritually uplifting.</p>
<p>The revelations of science, the collective revelations of really countless generations</p>
<p>of searchers and the little tiny bit we know about reality is the greatest joy for me because</p>
<p>I think that it relates to the idea of love.</p>
<p>What is love that is based on illusion about the other?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not love.</p>
<p>Love is seeing, unflinching the other and accepting with all your heart.</p>
<p>And to me, knowing the universe as it is, or the little bit that we&rsquo;re able to understand</p>
<p>at this point is the purest kind of love.</p>
<p>And therefore, you know, how can our philosophy, our religion, if it&rsquo;s rootless in nature,</p>
<p>how can it really be true?</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>So I think you need science to get a sense of the real romance of life and the great</p>
<p>experience of being awake in the cosmos.</p>
<p>So the fact that we know so little, the humbling nature of that, and you kind of connect love</p>
<p>to that, but isn&rsquo;t it also, isn&rsquo;t it scary?</p>
<p>Why is it so inspiring, do you think?</p>
<p>Why is it so beautiful that we know so little?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, as Socrates thought, you know, knowing that you know little is knowing,</p>
<p>really knowing something, knowing more than others.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s that voice whispering in our heads, you know, you might be wrong, which I think</p>
<p>is not only it&rsquo;s really healthy because we&rsquo;re so imperfect, we&rsquo;re human, of course, but</p>
<p>also, you know, love to me is the feeling that you always want to go deeper, get closer.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t get enough of it.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t get close enough, deep enough.</p>
<p>So and that&rsquo;s what science is always saying is science is never simply content with its</p>
<p>understanding of any aspect of nature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always saying it&rsquo;s always finding that even smaller cosmos beneath.</p>
<p>So I think the two are very much parallel.</p>
<p>So you said that love is not an illusion.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>What is love?</p>
<p>What is love is, is knowing, for me, love is, is knowing something deeply and still</p>
<p>being completely gratified by it, you know, and wanting to know more.</p>
<p>So what is love?</p>
<p>What is loving someone, a person, let&rsquo;s say deeply is not idealizing them, not putting</p>
<p>some kind of subjective projection on them, but knowing them as they are.</p>
<p>And so for me, for me, the only aperture to that knowing about nature, the universe is</p>
<p>science because it has that error correcting mechanism that most of the stuff that we do</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>You know, you could say the Bill of Rights is kind of an error correcting mechanism,</p>
<p>which is one of the things I really appreciate about the society in which I live to the extent</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s upheld and we keep faith with it and the same with science.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like we will give you the highest rewards we have for proving us wrong about something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s genius.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why, that&rsquo;s why in only 400 years since Galileo&rsquo;s first look through a telescope,</p>
<p>we could get from this really dim, vague, this vague apprehension of another world to</p>
<p>sending our eyes and our senses there or even to going beyond.</p>
<p>So it is, it is, it delivers the goods like nothing else, you know, it really, it delivers</p>
<p>the goods because it&rsquo;s always, it&rsquo;s always self aware of its fallibility.</p>
<p>So on that topic, I&rsquo;d like to ask your opinion and a feeling I have that I&rsquo;m not sure what</p>
<p>to do with, which is the, the skeptical aspect of science.</p>
<p>So the modern skeptics community and just in general, certain scientists, many scientists,</p>
<p>maybe most scientists that apply the scientific method are kind of rigorous in that application.</p>
<p>And they, it feels like sometimes miss out some of the ideas outside the reaches, just</p>
<p>slightly outside of the reach of science.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t dare to sort of dream or think of revolutionary ideas that others will call</p>
<p>crazy in this particular moment.</p>
<p>So how do you think about the skeptical aspect of science that is really good at sort of</p>
<p>keeping us in check, keeping us humble, but, but at the same time, sort of the kind of</p>
<p>dreams that you and Carl Sagan have inspired in the world, it kind of shuts it down sometimes</p>
<p>a little bit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s up to the individual, but for me, you know, I was so ridiculously</p>
<p>fortunate in that I, my tutorial in science, because I&rsquo;m not a scientist and I wasn&rsquo;t trained</p>
<p>in science, was 20 years of days and nights with Carl Sagan.</p>
<p>And the wonder, I think the reason Carl remains so beloved, well, I think there are many reasons,</p>
<p>but at the root of it is the fact that his skepticism was never at the cost of his wonder</p>
<p>and his wonder was never at the cost of his skepticism.</p>
<p>So he couldn&rsquo;t fool himself into believing something he wanted to believe because it</p>
<p>made him feel good at the other.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, he recognized that what science, what nature is, it&rsquo;s really,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good enough, you know, it&rsquo;s way better than our fantasies.</p>
<p>And so if you, if you&rsquo;re that kind of person who loves happiness, loves life and your eyes</p>
<p>are wide open and you read everything you can get your hands on and you spend years</p>
<p>studying what is known so far about the universe, then you have that capacity, a really infinite</p>
<p>capacity to be alive, but all, and also at the same time to be very rigorous about what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re willing to believe.</p>
<p>For Carl, I don&rsquo;t think he ever felt that his skepticism cost him anything because again,</p>
<p>it comes back to love.</p>
<p>He wanted to know what Nietzsche really was like, not to inflict his, you know, preconceived</p>
<p>notions on what he wanted it to be.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t go wrong because it doesn&rsquo;t, you know, I mean, you know, I think the pale</p>
<p>blue dot is the, is a perfect example of this, of his massive achievement is to say, okay,</p>
<p>or the Voyager record is another example is here we have this mission, our first reconnaissance</p>
<p>of the outer solar system.</p>
<p>Well, how can we make it a mission in which we absolutely squeeze every drop of consciousness</p>
<p>and understanding from it?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to be scientists and then be human beings.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the tragedy of Western civilization is that it&rsquo;s, you know, when it&rsquo;s one of its</p>
<p>greatest gifts has been science and yet at the same time, it believing that we are the</p>
<p>children of a disappointed father, a tyrant who puts us in a maximum security prison and</p>
<p>calls it paradise, who looks at us, who watches us every moment and hates us for being our</p>
<p>human selves, you know?</p>
<p>And then most of all, what is our great sin?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s partaking of the tree of knowledge, which is our greatest gift as humans.</p>
<p>This pattern recognition, this ability to see things and then synthesize them and jump</p>
<p>to conclusions about them and test those conclusions.</p>
<p>So I think the reason that in literature, in movies, the scientist is a figure of alienation,</p>
<p>a figure, you know, oh, you see these biopics about scientists and yeah, he might&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>great, but you know, he was missing in ship.</p>
<p>You know, he was a lousy husband.</p>
<p>He lacked, you know, the kind of spiritual understanding that maybe, you know, his wife</p>
<p>had and it&rsquo;s always in the end and they come around, but to me, that&rsquo;s a false dichotomy</p>
<p>that we are, you know, to the extent that we are aware of our surroundings and understand</p>
<p>them, which is what science makes it possible for us to do, we&rsquo;re even more alive.</p>
<p>So you mentioned a million awesome things there, let&rsquo;s even just, can you tell me about</p>
<p>the Voyager one and two spacecraft and the interstellar message project and that whole</p>
<p>just fascinating world leading up to.</p>
<p>One of my favorite subjects, I love talking about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never get over it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never be able to really wrap my head around the reality of it, the truth of it.</p>
<p>What is it first of all?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the Voyager spacecraft?</p>
<p>Okay, so Voyagers one and two were our first reconnaissance mission of what was then considered</p>
<p>the outer solar system and it was a gift of gravity.</p>
<p>The idea that swinging around these worlds gives you a gravitational assist, which ultimately</p>
<p>will send you out of the solar system to wander the Milky Way galaxy for one to five billion</p>
<p>years.</p>
<p>So Voyager gave us our first close up look of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.</p>
<p>It discovered new moons.</p>
<p>It discovered volcanoes on Io.</p>
<p>Its achievements are astonishing.</p>
<p>And remember, this is technology from the early to mid 1970s.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s still active.</p>
<p>We talked to Voyager a few days ago.</p>
<p>We talked to it, in fact, a year ago, I think it was.</p>
<p>We needed to slightly change the attitude of the spacecraft.</p>
<p>And so we fired up its thrusters for the first time since 1987.</p>
<p>Did they work?</p>
<p>Instantly.</p>
<p>It was as if you had left your car in the garage in 1987.</p>
<p>And you put the key in the ignition because you use keys then in the ignition and it turned</p>
<p>over the first time you stepped on the gas.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the genius of the engineering of Voyager.</p>
<p>And Carl was one of the key participants in imagining what its mission would be because</p>
<p>it was a gift actually of the fact that every 175 years, plus or minus, there is an alignment</p>
<p>of the worlds.</p>
<p>And so you could send two spacecraft to these other worlds and photograph them and use your</p>
<p>mass spectrometer and all the other devices on Voyager to really explore these worlds.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the farthest spacecraft, it&rsquo;s the farthest human creation away from us today.</p>
<p>Voyager 1.</p>
<p>These two spacecraft not only gave us our first close up look at hundreds of moons and</p>
<p>planets, these four giant planets, but also it told us the shape of the solar system as</p>
<p>it moves through the galaxy because there were two of them going in different directions</p>
<p>and they finally, and they arrived at a place called the heliopause, which is where the</p>
<p>wind from the sun, the solar wind dies down and the interstellar medium begins.</p>
<p>And both Voyagers were the first spacecraft that we had that could tell us when that happened.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a consummate, I think it&rsquo;s the greatest scientific achievement of the 20th century.</p>
<p>And engineering in some sense.</p>
<p>Engineering, I mean really, you know, Voyager is doing this on less energy than you have</p>
<p>in your toaster, something like 11 Watts.</p>
<p>So okay, but because of this gravitational assist, both Voyagers were destined, as I</p>
<p>say, to, first of all, they were supposed to function for a dozen years and now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>42 years since launch and we&rsquo;re still talking to them.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>But prior to launch, almost a year, eight, nine months prior to launch, it was decided</p>
<p>that since Frank Drake and Carl Sagan and Linda Solzman Sagan had created something</p>
<p>called the Pioneer 10 Plaque for the Pioneer spacecraft that preceded Voyager, which was</p>
<p>kind of like a license plate for the planet Earth, you know, man and a woman, hands up,</p>
<p>you know, very, very basic, but very effective.</p>
<p>And it captured the imagination of people all over the world.</p>
<p>And so NASA turned to Frank and to Carl and said, we&rsquo;d like you to do a message for Voyager</p>
<p>because if it&rsquo;s going to be circumnavigating the Milky Way galaxy for one to five billion</p>
<p>years, you know, it&rsquo;s like 20 trips around the galaxy.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a very small chance that a space faring civilization would be able to flag</p>
<p>one of them down.</p>
<p>And so on board, you see this exquisite golden disc with scientific hieroglyphics explaining</p>
<p>our address and various basic scientific concepts that we believe that would be common to any</p>
<p>space faring civilization.</p>
<p>And then beneath this exquisite golden disc is the Voyager record, the golden record.</p>
<p>And it contains something like 118 photographs, images of life on Earth, as well as 27 pieces</p>
<p>of music from all around the world.</p>
<p>Many people describe it as the invention of world music.</p>
<p>World music was not a concept that existed before the Voyager record.</p>
<p>And we were determined to take our music, not just from the dominant technical cultures,</p>
<p>but from all of the rich cultural heritage of the Earth.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a sound essay, which is a kind of using a microphone as a camera to tell</p>
<p>the story of the Earth, beginning with its geological sounds and moving into biology</p>
<p>and then into technology.</p>
<p>And I think what you were getting at is that at the end of this sound essay, I had asked</p>
<p>Carl if it were, in the making of the record, it was my honor to be the creative director</p>
<p>of the project, if it was possible to, if I had meditated for an hour while I was hooked</p>
<p>up so that every single signal that was coming from my brain, my body, was recorded and then</p>
<p>converted into sound for the record.</p>
<p>Was it possible that these putative extraterrestrials of the distant future, of perhaps a billion</p>
<p>years from now, would be able to reconstitute this message and to understand it?</p>
<p>And he just, big smile, you know, and just said, well, hey, a billion years is a long</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long time.</p>
<p>Go do it.</p>
<p>And so I did this.</p>
<p>And what were you thinking about in the meditation?</p>
<p>Like what, I mean, it&rsquo;s such an interesting idea of recording as you think about things.</p>
<p>What were you thinking about?</p>
<p>So I was blindfolded and couldn&rsquo;t hear anything.</p>
<p>And I had made a mental itinerary of exactly where I wanted to go.</p>
<p>I was truly humbled by the idea that these thoughts could conceivably touch the distant</p>
<p>future.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>So in 1977, there are some 60,000 nuclear weapons on the planet.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union and the United States are engaged in a, you know, to the death competition.</p>
<p>And so I began by trying to tell the history of the planet in, you know, to my limited</p>
<p>ability what I understood about the story of the early existence of the planet, about</p>
<p>the origin of life, about the evolution of life, about the history of humans, about our</p>
<p>current at that time predicament, about the fact that one in five of us was starving or</p>
<p>unable to get potable water.</p>
<p>And so I sort of gave a kind of, you know, as general a picture as I possibly could of</p>
<p>our predicament.</p>
<p>And I also was very newly within days of the moment when Carl and I fell in love with each</p>
<p>other.</p>
<p>We had fallen in love with each other long before because we&rsquo;d known each other for years,</p>
<p>but it was the first time that we had expressed our feelings for each other.</p>
<p>Acknowledged it, the existence of this love.</p>
<p>Yes, because we were both involved with other people and it was a completely outside his</p>
<p>morality and mine to even broach the subject.</p>
<p>But it was only days after that it happened.</p>
<p>And for me, it was a eureka moment.</p>
<p>It was in the context of finding that piece of Chinese music that was worthy to represent</p>
<p>one of the oldest musical traditions on earth when those of us who worked on the Voyager</p>
<p>record were completely ignorant about Chinese music.</p>
<p>And so that had been a constant challenge for me, talking to professors of Chinese music,</p>
<p>listening to musicologists everywhere and all through the project, desperately trying</p>
<p>to find this one piece.</p>
<p>Found the piece, lived on the Upper West Side, found the piece, a professor at Columbia University</p>
<p>gave it to me.</p>
<p>And of all the people I talked to, everyone had said, that&rsquo;s hopeless.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>There can&rsquo;t be one piece of Chinese music.</p>
<p>But he was completely, no problem, I&rsquo;ve got it.</p>
<p>And so he told me the story of the piece, which only made it an even greater candidate</p>
<p>for the record.</p>
<p>And I listened to it, called Carl Sagan, who was in Tucson, Arizona addressing the American</p>
<p>Society of Newspaper Editors.</p>
<p>And I left him a message, hotel message center.</p>
<p>And he called me back an hour later.</p>
<p>And I heard this beautiful voice say, I get back to my hotel room, and I find this message</p>
<p>that Annie called.</p>
<p>And I asked myself, why didn&rsquo;t you leave me this message 10 years ago?</p>
<p>My heart was beating out of my chest.</p>
<p>I, it was for me a kind of eureka moment, a scientific breakthrough, a truth, a great</p>
<p>truth had suddenly been revealed.</p>
<p>And of course, I was awkward and didn&rsquo;t really know what to say.</p>
<p>And so I blurted something out like, oh, I&rsquo;ve been meaning to talk to you about that, Carl,</p>
<p>which wasn&rsquo;t really true.</p>
<p>I never would have talked to him about it.</p>
<p>We had been alone countless times.</p>
<p>We humans are so awkward in these moments and these amazing moments.</p>
<p>And I just said, for keeps.</p>
<p>And he thought for a very brief, like a second and said, you mean get married?</p>
<p>And I said, yeah.</p>
<p>And he said, yeah.</p>
<p>And we put down the phone.</p>
<p>And I literally was jumping around my apartment like a lunatic, because it was so obvious,</p>
<p>you know, it was something like, of course.</p>
<p>And then the phone rang again.</p>
<p>And I thought, damn, no, he&rsquo;s going to say, I don&rsquo;t know what I was saying.</p>
<p>I am married.</p>
<p>I have a kid.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to do this, you know?</p>
<p>But he was like, I just want to make sure that that really happened.</p>
<p>And I said, yeah.</p>
<p>And he said, we&rsquo;re getting married.</p>
<p>And I said, yeah, we&rsquo;re getting married.</p>
<p>Now this was June 1st, 1977.</p>
<p>The records had not been affixed to the spacecraft yet.</p>
<p>And there had been a lot of controversy about what we were doing.</p>
<p>I should say that among the 118 pictures was an image of a man and a woman, frontally,</p>
<p>completely naked.</p>
<p>And there was, I believe, a congressman on the floor that said, NASA to send smut to</p>
<p>the stars, you know?</p>
<p>And so NASA really, they got very upset and they said, you can&rsquo;t send a picture.</p>
<p>And we had done it so that it was so brilliant.</p>
<p>It was like this lovely couple, completely naked.</p>
<p>And then the next image was a kind of overlay schematic to show the fetus inside this woman</p>
<p>that was developing.</p>
<p>And then that went off into, you know, additional imagery of human reproduction.</p>
<p>And it really hit me that how much we hate ourselves, that we couldn&rsquo;t bear to be seen</p>
<p>as we are.</p>
<p>So in some sense that congressman also represents our society.</p>
<p>Perhaps his opposition should have been included as well.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, that was one of the most vigorous debates during the making of the record with the,</p>
<p>you know, the five, six people that we collaborated with was, do we show, do we only put our best</p>
<p>foot forward?</p>
<p>Or do we show Hiroshima, Auschwitz, the Congo, what we have done?</p>
<p>What do you think represents humanity?</p>
<p>If you kind of, if you think about it, do our darker moments, are they essential for</p>
<p>humanity?</p>
<p>All the wars we&rsquo;ve been through, all the tortures and the suffering and the cruelty.</p>
<p>Is that essential for happiness, for beauty, for creation, generally speaking?</p>
<p>Well, certainly not essential for happiness or beauty, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s part of who we are, if we&rsquo;re going to be real about it, which is, you know,</p>
<p>I think we tell on ourselves, even if we don&rsquo;t want to be real, we, you know, I think that</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a spacefaring civilization, and you&rsquo;ve gotten it together sufficiently, that</p>
<p>you can move from world to world, then I think they probably took one look at this derelict</p>
<p>spacecraft and they knew that these were people in their technological adolescence, and they</p>
<p>were just setting forth, and they must have had these issues, you know, because it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and so it really, you know, that&rsquo;s the great thing about lying is that a lie only has a</p>
<p>shelf life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, if like a great work of art that&rsquo;s a forgery, people can be fooled immediately,</p>
<p>but 10 or 15 years, 20 years later, they start to look at it and, you know, they begin to</p>
<p>realize the lens, our lens of our present is coloring everything that we see.</p>
<p>So you know, I think it didn&rsquo;t matter that we didn&rsquo;t show our atrocities.</p>
<p>They would fill in the blanks.</p>
<p>So let me sort of ask, you&rsquo;ve mentioned how unlikely it is that you and Carl did two souls</p>
<p>like yours would meet in this vast world.</p>
<p>What are your views on how and why incredibly unlikely things like these nevertheless do</p>
<p>happen?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s purely to me, chance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s totally random.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a just, I mean, but, and the fact is, is that some people are, and it&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>every day right now.</p>
<p>Some people are the random casualties of chance and that, and I don&rsquo;t just mean the people</p>
<p>who are being, you know, destroyed in childhood, in wartime, I&rsquo;m also, or the people who starved</p>
<p>to death because of famine, but also the people who, you know, who are not living to the fullest,</p>
<p>all of these things.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a, my parents met on the subway in rush hour.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m only here with you because of the most random possible situation.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve had this, a sense of this, even before I knew Carl, I always felt this way</p>
<p>that I only existed because of the generosity of the rush hour, no, of just all of the things,</p>
<p>all of the skeins of causality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting because, you know, the rush hour is a source of stress for a lot of people,</p>
<p>but clearly in its moments, it can also be a source of something beautiful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Of strangers meeting and so on.</p>
<p>So everything, everything is, has a possibility of doing something beautiful.</p>
<p>So let me ask sort of a quick tangent on the Voyager, this, this beautiful romantic notion</p>
<p>that Voyager One is sort of our farthest human reach into space.</p>
<p>If you think of what, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve seen, but what Elon Musk did with putting</p>
<p>the Roadster, letting it fly out into space, there&rsquo;s a sort of humor to it.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s also kind of interesting, but maybe you can comment on that.</p>
<p>But in general, if now that we are developing what we were venturing out into space again</p>
<p>in a more serious way, what kind of stuff that represent since Voyager was launched,</p>
<p>should we send out as a followup?</p>
<p>Is there things that you think that&rsquo;s developed in the next, in the 40 years after that we</p>
<p>should update the spacefaring aliens?</p>
<p>Well, of course now we could send the worldwide, we could send everything that&rsquo;s on the worldwide</p>
<p>web.</p>
<p>We could send, I mean, you know, that was a time when we&rsquo;re talking about photograph records</p>
<p>and transistor radios and, you know, so we tried to be, to take advantage of the existing</p>
<p>technology to the fullest extent, you know, the computer that was hooked up to me from</p>
<p>my brainwaves and my heart sounds while I was meditating was, you know, the size of</p>
<p>a gigantic room.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not that, it didn&rsquo;t have the power of a phone, as the phone has now.</p>
<p>So you know, now we could just, I think we could let it all hang out and just like send,</p>
<p>you know, every week.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the wonder, like I would send, you know, Wikipedia or something and not be</p>
<p>a gatekeeper, but show who we are.</p>
<p>You were also, it&rsquo;s interesting because one of the problems of the internet of having</p>
<p>so much information is it&rsquo;s actually the curation, the human curation is still the powerful,</p>
<p>beautiful thing.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So what you did with the record is actually, is exactly the right process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of boiling down a massive amount of possibilities of what you could send into</p>
<p>something that represents, you know, the better angels of our nature or represents our humanity.</p>
<p>So if you think about, you know, what would you send from the internet as opposed to sending</p>
<p>all of Wikipedia, for example, all human knowledge, is there something just new that we&rsquo;ve developed,</p>
<p>you think, or fundamentally we&rsquo;re still the same kind of human species?</p>
<p>I think fundamentally we&rsquo;re the same, but we have advanced to an astonishing degree</p>
<p>in our capacity for data retrieval and for transmission.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I would send YouTube, I would send, you know, really like think of</p>
<p>all the, you know, I still feel so lucky that there&rsquo;s any great musical artist of the last</p>
<p>hundred years who I revere, I can just find them and watch them and listen to them.</p>
<p>And you know, that&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>I also love how democratic it is that we each become curators and that we each decide those</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>Now, I may not agree with, you know, the choices that everyone makes, but of course not because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the point.</p>
<p>The point is, is that we are, you know, we have discovered largely through the internet</p>
<p>that we are an intercommunicating organism and that can only be good.</p>
<p>So you could also send now, Cosmos.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;d love to.</p>
<p>I would be proud to.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve spoken about a very specific voice that Cosmos had in that it reveals the</p>
<p>magic of science.</p>
<p>I think you said shamanic journey of it and not the details of the latest breakthroughs</p>
<p>or so on.</p>
<p>Just revealing the magic.</p>
<p>Can you try to describe what this voice of Cosmos is with the follow up and the new Cosmos</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re working on now?</p>
<p>Yes, well, the dream of Cosmos is really like Einstein&rsquo;s quote, you know, it&rsquo;s the idea</p>
<p>of the awesome power of science to be in absolutely everyone&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>You know, it belongs to all of us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the preserve of a priesthood.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the community of science is becoming more diverse and being less exclusive than</p>
<p>it was guilty of in the not so recent past.</p>
<p>The discoveries of science, our understanding of the Cosmos that we live in has really grown</p>
<p>by leaps and bounds and probably we&rsquo;ve learned more in the last hundred years about it.</p>
<p>You know, the tempo of discovery has picked up so rapidly.</p>
<p>And so the idea of Cosmos from the 1970s when Carl and I and Steven Soder, another astronomer,</p>
<p>first imagined it was that interweaving not only of the scientific concepts and revelations</p>
<p>and using, you know, cinematic VFX to take the viewer on this transporting, uplifting</p>
<p>journey but also the stories of the searchers.</p>
<p>Because the more I have learned about, you know, the process of science through my life</p>
<p>with Carl and sense, the more I am really persuaded that it&rsquo;s that adherence to the</p>
<p>facts and to that adherence to that little approximation, that little bit of reality</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been able to get our hands around is something that we desperately need and</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you are a scientist.</p>
<p>In fact, the people, it matters even more if you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>And since, you know, the level of science teaching has been fairly or unfairly maligned</p>
<p>and the idea that once there was such a thing as a television network, which of course has</p>
<p>now evolved into many other things, the idea that you could in the most democratic way</p>
<p>make accessible to absolutely everyone and most especially people who don&rsquo;t even realize</p>
<p>that they have an interest in a subject or who feel so intimidated by the jargon of science</p>
<p>and its kind of exclusive history.</p>
<p>The idea that we could do this and, you know, in season two of Cosmos, the Space Time Odyssey,</p>
<p>we were in 181 countries in the space of two weeks.</p>
<p>It was the largest rollout in television history, which is really amazing for a, there is no</p>
<p>science based programming.</p>
<p>By the way, just to clarify, the series was rolled out, so it was shown in not that many</p>
<p>countries.</p>
<p>You said we were in.</p>
<p>Well, our show was in 180 countries.</p>
<p>Yeah, the show, which is incredible.</p>
<p>I mean, the hundreds of millions, whatever that number is, the people that watched it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so crazy that, for instance, my son had a cerebral hemorrhage a year ago and the doctor</p>
<p>who saved his life in a very dangerous situation.</p>
<p>When he realized that, you know, that Sam and I were who we were, he said, that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here.</p>
<p>You know, he said, if you come of age in a poor country like Colombia and Carl Sagan</p>
<p>calls you to science when you&rsquo;re a child, then, then, you know, you go to medicine because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only avenue open to you, but that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve heard that story and I hear that story, I think every week.</p>
<p>How does that make you feel?</p>
<p>I mean, the number of scientists, I mean, a lot of it is quiet, right?</p>
<p>But the number of scientists Cosmos has created is just countless.</p>
<p>I mean, it probably touched a lot of, I don&rsquo;t know, probably it could be a crazy number</p>
<p>of the 90% of scientists or something that have been.</p>
<p>I would love to do that census because I, because that&rsquo;s the greatest gratification,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the dream of science.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole idea is that if it belongs to all of us and not just a tiny few, then</p>
<p>we have some chance of determining how it&rsquo;s used.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s only in the hands of people whose only, whose only interests are the balance</p>
<p>sheet or hegemony over other nations or things like that, then it&rsquo;ll probably end up being</p>
<p>a gun aimed at our heads.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s distributed in the widest possible way, a capability that we now have because</p>
<p>of our technology, then the chance is that it will be used with wisdom.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the dream of it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why we did the first Cosmos.</p>
<p>We wanted to take not just, as I say, the scientific information, but also tell the</p>
<p>stories of these searchers.</p>
<p>Because for us, and for me, carrying on this series in the second and third seasons, the</p>
<p>primary interest was that we wouldn&rsquo;t tell a story unless it was a kind of a threefer.</p>
<p>It was not just a way to understand a new scientific idea, but it was also a way to</p>
<p>understand what, if it matters what&rsquo;s true, how the world can change for us and how we</p>
<p>can be protected.</p>
<p>And if it doesn&rsquo;t matter what&rsquo;s true, then we&rsquo;re in grave danger because we have the</p>
<p>capability to not only destroy ourselves and our civilization, but to take so many species</p>
<p>with us.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like to talk to you about that particular, sort of the dangers of ourselves in a little</p>
<p>bit, but sort of to linger on Cosmos.</p>
<p>Maybe for the first, the 1980 and the 2014 follow up, what&rsquo;s a, or one of the, or several</p>
<p>memorable moments from the creation of either of those seasons?</p>
<p>Well, you know, the critical thing really was the fact that Seth MacFarlane became art</p>
<p>champion because I had been with three colleagues, I had been schlepping around from network</p>
<p>to network with a treatment for Cosmos and every network said they wanted to do it, but</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t give me creative control and they wouldn&rsquo;t give me enough money to make</p>
<p>it cinematic and to make it feel like you&rsquo;re really going on an adventure.</p>
<p>And so I think both of those things, sorry to interrupt, both of those things are given</p>
<p>what Cosmos represents, the legacy of it and the legacy of Carl Sagan is essential control,</p>
<p>especially in the modern world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wonderful that you sought control, that you did not really push it.</p>
<p>And I kept saying no.</p>
<p>And my partners, I&rsquo;m sure, you know, they would look at me like I was nuts, you know,</p>
<p>and they probably must have entertained the idea that maybe I didn&rsquo;t really want to do</p>
<p>it, you know, because I was afraid or something, but I kept saying no.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t until I met Seth MacFarlane and he took me to Fox and to Peter Rice and</p>
<p>said, you know, I&rsquo;ll pay for half the pilot if I have to, you know, and Peter Rice was</p>
<p>like, put your money away.</p>
<p>And in every time since, in the 10 years since, at every turn, when we needed Seth to intervene</p>
<p>on our behalf, he stood up and he did it.</p>
<p>And so that was like, in a way, that is the watershed for me of everything that followed</p>
<p>since.</p>
<p>And I was so lucky because, you know, Steve Soder and I written the original Cosmos with</p>
<p>Carl and collaborated on the treatment for season two.</p>
<p>And then Brennan Braga came into our project at the perfect moment and has proven to be</p>
<p>just the, really, I have been so lucky my whole life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve collaborated, I&rsquo;ve been lucky with the people, my collaborators have been extraordinary.</p>
<p>And so that was a critical thing.</p>
<p>But also to have, you know, for instance, our astonishing VFX supervisor who comes from</p>
<p>the movies, who heads the global association of VFX people, Jeff Okun.</p>
<p>And then, you know, I could rattle off 10 more names, I&rsquo;d be happy to do that.</p>
<p>And it was that collaboration.</p>
<p>So the people were essential to the creation of&hellip;</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I mean, when it came down, I have to say that when it came down to the vision of what the</p>
<p>series would be, that was me sitting in my home, looking out the window and, you know,</p>
<p>really imagining like what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>Can you pause on that for a second?</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s that process?</p>
<p>Because it, you know, Cosmos is also, it&rsquo;s grounded in science, of course, but it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>incredibly imaginative and the words used are carefully crafted.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>If you can talk about the process of that, the big picture, imaginative thinking, and</p>
<p>sort of the rigorous crafting of words that like basically turns into something like poetry.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>For me, these are rare occasions for human self esteem.</p>
<p>The scientists that we bring to life in Cosmos are people, in my view, who have everything</p>
<p>we need to see us through this current crisis.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re, very often they come, they&rsquo;re poor, they&rsquo;re female, they&rsquo;re outsiders who are</p>
<p>not expected to have gifts that are so prodigious, but they persevere.</p>
<p>And so you have someone like Michael Faraday, who comes from a family, dysfunctional family</p>
<p>of like 14 people and, you know, it never goes to, university never learns the math.</p>
<p>But, you know, is the, you know, there&rsquo;s Einstein years later looking up at the picture of Faraday</p>
<p>to inspire him.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, you know, if we had people with that kind of humility and unselfishness who didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to patent everything, as, you know, Michael Faraday created the wealth of the 20th century</p>
<p>with his various inventions.</p>
<p>And yet he never took out a single patent at a time when people were patenting everything</p>
<p>because that was not what he was about.</p>
<p>And to me, that&rsquo;s a kind of almost a saintliness that says that, you know, here&rsquo;s a man who</p>
<p>finds in his life, this tremendous gratification from searching.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just so impressive to me.</p>
<p>And there are so many other people in Cosmos, especially the new season of Cosmos, which</p>
<p>is called Possible Worlds.</p>
<p>Possible, beautiful title.</p>
<p>Possible Worlds, well, I stole it from an author and a scientist from the 1940s.</p>
<p>But it, for me, encapsulates not just, you know, the exoplanets that we&rsquo;ve begun to discover,</p>
<p>not just, you know, the worlds that we might visit, but also the world that this could</p>
<p>be, a hopeful vision of the future.</p>
<p>You asked me what is common to all three seasons of Cosmos or what is that voice?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a voice of hope.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a voice that says there is a future which we bring to life in, I think, a fairly dazzling</p>
<p>fashion that we can still have, you know?</p>
<p>And in sitting down to imagine what this season would be, the new season would be, I&rsquo;m sitting</p>
<p>where I live in Ithaca, beautiful, just gorgeous place, trees everywhere, waterfalls, I&rsquo;m sitting</p>
<p>there thinking, well, you know, you can&rsquo;t, how do you, how do you awaken people?</p>
<p>I mean, you can&rsquo;t yell at them and say we&rsquo;re all going to die, you know?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t help.</p>
<p>But I think if you give them a vision of the future that&rsquo;s not pie in the sky, but something,</p>
<p>ways in which science can be redemptive, can actually remediate our future.</p>
<p>We have those capabilities right now, as well as the capabilities to do things in the Cosmos</p>
<p>that we could be doing right now, but we&rsquo;re not doing them.</p>
<p>Not because we don&rsquo;t know how to, how, you know, with the engineering or the material</p>
<p>sciences or the physics, we know all we need to know, but we&rsquo;re a little bit paralyzed</p>
<p>in some sense.</p>
<p>And you know, we&rsquo;re like, I always think we&rsquo;re like the toddler, you know, like we, we left</p>
<p>our mother&rsquo;s legs, you know, and scurried out to the moon.</p>
<p>And we had a moment of, wow, we can do this.</p>
<p>And then we realized, and somehow we had a failure of nerve and we went scurrying back</p>
<p>to our mother and, you know, did things that really weren&rsquo;t going to get us out there,</p>
<p>like the space shuttle, things like that, because it was a kind of failure of nerve.</p>
<p>So Cosmos is about overcoming those fears.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re now as a civilization, ready to be a teenager venturing out into college.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re returning back.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of my theories about our current situation is that this is our adolescence.</p>
<p>And I was a total mess as an adolescent.</p>
<p>I was reckless, irresponsible, totally.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t, I was inconsiderate.</p>
<p>I, the reality of other people&rsquo;s feelings and the future didn&rsquo;t exist for me.</p>
<p>So why should a technologically adolescent civilization be any different?</p>
<p>But you know, the vast majority of people I know made it through that period and went</p>
<p>on to be more wise.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what my hope is for our civilization.</p>
<p>On a sort of a darker and more difficult subject in terms of, so you just talked about the</p>
<p>Cosmos being an inspiration for science and for us growing out of our messy adolescence,</p>
<p>but nevertheless, there is threats in this world.</p>
<p>So do you worry about existential threats?</p>
<p>Like you mentioned nuclear weapons, do you worry about nuclear war?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And if you could also maybe comment, I don&rsquo;t know how much you&rsquo;ve thought about it, but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s folks like Elon Musk who are worried about the existential threats of artificial</p>
<p>intelligence.</p>
<p>Sort of our robotic computer creations sort of resulting in us humans losing control.</p>
<p>So can you speak to the things that worry you in terms of existential concerns?</p>
<p>All of the above.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be silly, you know, like not to think and not to look at, for instance,</p>
<p>our rapidly burgeoning capability in artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>And to see how sick so much of the planet is not to be concerned.</p>
<p>And sick is an evil potentially.</p>
<p>Well, how much cruelty and brutality is happening at this very moment?</p>
<p>And I would put climate change higher up on that list, because I believe that there are</p>
<p>unforeseen discoveries that we are making right now, for instance, all that methane</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming out of the ocean floor that was sequestered because of the permafrost,</p>
<p>which is now melting.</p>
<p>You know, I think there are other effects besides our greed and short term thinking</p>
<p>that we are triggering now with all the greenhouse gases we&rsquo;re putting into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>And that worries me day and night.</p>
<p>I think about it every single, every moment, really, because I really think that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>we have to be.</p>
<p>We have to begin to really focus on how grave the challenge is to our civilization and to</p>
<p>the other species that are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mass, this is a mass extinction event that we&rsquo;re living through.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re seeing it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing news of it every day.</p>
<p>So what do you think about another touchy subject, but what do you think about the politicization</p>
<p>of science on topics like global warming and bionic stem cell research and other topics</p>
<p>like it?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>What do you mean by the politicization of global warming?</p>
<p>Meaning that if you say, I think what you just said, which is a global warming is a</p>
<p>serious concern, it&rsquo;s human caused and maybe some detrimental effects.</p>
<p>Certainly there&rsquo;s a large percent of the population of the United States that would, as opposed</p>
<p>to listening to that statement, would immediately think, oh, that&rsquo;s just a liberal talking point.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I mean by politicization.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s not so true anymore.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think our problem is a population that&rsquo;s skeptical about climate change because</p>
<p>I think that the extreme weather and fire events that we are experiencing with such</p>
<p>frequency is really gotten to people.</p>
<p>I think that there are people in leadership positions who choose to ignore it and to pretend</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not there, but ultimately I think they will be rejected.</p>
<p>The question is, will it be fast enough?</p>
<p>I think actually that most people have really finally taken the reality of global climate</p>
<p>change to heart and they look at their children and grandchildren and they don&rsquo;t feel good</p>
<p>because they come from a world which was in many ways, in terms of climate, fairly familiar</p>
<p>and benign and they know that we&rsquo;re headed in another direction and it&rsquo;s not just that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what we do to the oceans, the rivers, the air.</p>
<p>You ask me, what is the message of cosmos?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that we have to think in longer terms.</p>
<p>I think of the Soviet Union and the United States in the Cold War and they&rsquo;re ready to</p>
<p>kill each other over these two different views of the distribution of resources.</p>
<p>But neither of them has a form of human social organization that thinks in terms of a hundred</p>
<p>years, let alone a thousand years, which are the time scales that science speaks in.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of the problem is that we have to get a grip on reality and where we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>headed and I&rsquo;m not fatalistic at all, but I do feel like, and in setting out to do this</p>
<p>series each season, we were talking about climate change in the original cosmos in episode</p>
<p>four and warning about inadvertent climate modification in 1980.</p>
<p>And of course, Carl did his PhD thesis on the greenhouse effect on Venus and he was</p>
<p>painfully cognizant of what a runaway greenhouse effect would do to our planet.</p>
<p>And not only that, but the climatic history of the planet, which we go into in great detail</p>
<p>in the series.</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean, how are we going to get a grip on this if not through some kind of understanding</p>
<p>of science?</p>
<p>Can I just say one more thing about science is that its powers of prophecy are astonishing.</p>
<p>You launch a spacecraft in 1977 and you know where each and every planet in the solar system</p>
<p>is going to be and every moon and you rendezvous with that flawlessly and you exceed the design</p>
<p>specifications of the greatest dreams of the engineers.</p>
<p>And then you go on to explore the Milky Way galaxy and you do it, I mean, you know, the</p>
<p>climate scientists, some of the people whose stories we tell in cosmos, their predictions</p>
<p>were, and they were working with very early computer modeling capabilities, they have</p>
<p>proven to be so robust, nuclear winter, all of these things.</p>
<p>This is a prophetic power and yet how crazy that, you know, it&rsquo;s like the Romans with</p>
<p>their lead cooking pots and their lead pipes or the Aztecs ripping out their own people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hearts.</p>
<p>This is us.</p>
<p>We know better and yet we are acting as if it&rsquo;s business as usual.</p>
<p>Yeah, the beautiful complexity of human nature, speaking of which, let me ask a tough question</p>
<p>I guess because there&rsquo;s so many possible answers, but what aspect of life here on earth do you</p>
<p>find most fascinating from the origin of life, the evolutionary process itself, the origin</p>
<p>of the human mind, so intelligence, some of the technological developments going on now</p>
<p>or us venturing out into space or space exploration, what just inspires you?</p>
<p>Oh, they all inspire me.</p>
<p>Every one of those inspire me, but I have to say that to me at the origin of, as I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>gotten older, to me, the origin of life has become less interesting because I feel, well,</p>
<p>not because it&rsquo;s more, I think I understand, I have a better grasp of how it might&rsquo;ve happened.</p>
<p>Do you think it was a huge leap?</p>
<p>I think it was a, we are a byproduct of geophysics and I think it&rsquo;s not, my suspicion of course,</p>
<p>which is take it with a grain of salt, but my suspicion is that it happens more often</p>
<p>and more places than we like to think because after all the history of our thinking about</p>
<p>ourselves has been a constant series of demotions in which we&rsquo;ve had to realize, no, no, so</p>
<p>to me that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not at the center of the solar system.</p>
<p>And the origin of consciousness is to me also not so amazing if you think of it as going</p>
<p>back to these one celled organisms of a billion years ago who had to know, well, if I go higher</p>
<p>up, I&rsquo;ll get too much sun and if I go lower down, I&rsquo;ll be protected from UV rays, things</p>
<p>like that.</p>
<p>They had to know that or you, I eat, me, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, even that, I can see if you know that, then knowing what we know now, it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not so hard to fathom.</p>
<p>It seems like, I&rsquo;ve never believed there was a duality between our minds and our bodies</p>
<p>and I think that even consciousness, all those interesting things seem to me, except one</p>
<p>of the things&hellip;</p>
<p>A byproduct of geophysics.</p>
<p>Yeah, all of chemistry, yes, geochemistry, geophysics, absolutely.</p>
<p>It makes perfect sense to me and it doesn&rsquo;t make it any less wondrous.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t rob it at all of the wonder of it.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, I think that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>I think we tell the story of someone you have never heard of, I guarantee, and I think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>very knowledgeable on the subject, who was more responsible for our ability to venture</p>
<p>out to other worlds than anyone else and who was completely forgotten.</p>
<p>And so, those are the kinds of stories I like best for Cosmos because&hellip;</p>
<p>Can you tell me who?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m going to make you watch this series, I&rsquo;m going to make you buy my book, but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just saying, this person would be forgotten, but the way that we do Cosmos is that I ask</p>
<p>a question to myself, I really want to get to the bottom to the answer and keep going</p>
<p>deeper, deeper until we find what the story is, a story that I know because I&rsquo;m not a</p>
<p>scientist.</p>
<p>If it moves me, if it moves me, then I want to tell it and other people will be moved.</p>
<p>Do you ponder mortality, human mortality, and maybe even your own mortality?</p>
<p>Oh, all the time.</p>
<p>I just turned 70, so yeah, I think about it a lot.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, you know, how can you not think about it?</p>
<p>What do you make of this short life of ours, I mean, let me ask a sort of another way,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve lost Carl, and speaking of mortality, if you could be, if you could choose immortality,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s possible that science allows us to live much, much longer.</p>
<p>Is that something you would choose for yourself, for Carl, for you?</p>
<p>Well, for Carl, definitely.</p>
<p>I would have, you know, in a nanosecond, I would take that deal.</p>
<p>But not for me.</p>
<p>I mean, if Carl were alive, yes, I would want to live forever because I know it would be</p>
<p>fun.</p>
<p>But no.</p>
<p>Would it be fun forever?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the essential nature of the&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the universe is so full of so many wonderful things to discover that</p>
<p>it feels like it would be fun.</p>
<p>But no, I don&rsquo;t want to live forever.</p>
<p>I have had a magical life.</p>
<p>I just, you know, my craziest dreams have come true.</p>
<p>And I feel, you know, forgive me, but this crazy quirk of fate that put my most joyful,</p>
<p>deepest feelings, feelings that decades later, 42 years later, I know how real, how true</p>
<p>those feelings were.</p>
<p>Everything that happened after that was an affirmation of how true those feelings were.</p>
<p>And so, I don&rsquo;t feel that way.</p>
<p>I feel like I have gotten so much more than my share, not just my extraordinary life with</p>
<p>Carl, my family, my parents, my children, my friends, the places that I&rsquo;ve been able</p>
<p>to explore, the books I&rsquo;ve read, the music I&rsquo;ve heard.</p>
<p>So I feel like, you know, if it would be much better if instead of working on the immortality</p>
<p>of the lucky few of the most privileged people in this society, I would really like to see</p>
<p>a concerted effort for us to get our act together, you know?</p>
<p>That to me is topic A, more pressing, you know, this possible world, that is the challenge.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re at a kind of moment where if we can make that choice.</p>
<p>So immortality doesn&rsquo;t really interest me.</p>
<p>I really, I love nature and I have to say that because I&rsquo;m a product of nature, I recognize</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s great gifts and it&rsquo;s great cruelty.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better way to end it, and thank you so much for talking</p>
<p>to us.</p>
<p>It was an honor.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>I thought your questions were great.</p>

<p>And now let me leave you with some words of wisdom from Carl Sagan.</p>
<p>What an astonishing thing a book is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny</p>
<p>dark squiggles.</p>
<p>But one glance at it, and you&rsquo;re inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead</p>
<p>for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly</p>
<p>to you.</p>
<p>Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions.</p>
<p>Finding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs.</p>
<p>Books break the shackles of time.</p>
<p>A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
