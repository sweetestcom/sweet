Good morning. And welcome to WWDC.
WWDC is an incredibly important event to Apple, our developers and our users.
It&amp;rsquo;s here that we bring some of our biggest innovations to life.
And we have not stopped innovating,
doing the work that will enrich people&amp;rsquo;s lives for years to come.
Because we&amp;rsquo;re all looking forward to a more hopeful tomorrow.
That&amp;rsquo;s why we believe it&amp;rsquo;s so important to have WWDC this year.'>

<p>[&ldquo;Daydreamer&rdquo; by Aurora playing]</p>
<p>Good morning. And welcome to WWDC.</p>
<p>WWDC is an incredibly important event to Apple, our developers and our users.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s here that we bring some of our biggest innovations to life.</p>
<p>And we have not stopped innovating,</p>
<p>doing the work that will enrich people&rsquo;s lives for years to come.</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re all looking forward to a more hopeful tomorrow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we believe it&rsquo;s so important to have WWDC this year.</p>
<p>And while it cannot possibly feel the same in here without you,</p>
<p>I can assure you that we have a great show ahead of us.</p>
<p>This year we&rsquo;re delivering the conference in a whole new way</p>
<p>to all of you around the world, directly to your home.</p>
<p>And we want to welcome you to our home here at Apple Park.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to first talk to you about two big things</p>
<p>that are happening in the world right now.</p>
<p>To start, I want to address the topic of racism, inequality and injustice</p>
<p>and to recognize the pain being felt throughout our nation,</p>
<p>especially in our Black and Brown communities,</p>
<p>after the senseless killing of George Floyd.</p>
<p>And while the events of this past month are sadly not new,</p>
<p>they have caused us to face</p>
<p>long-standing institutional inequalities and social injustices.</p>
<p>This country was founded on the principles of freedom and equality for all.</p>
<p>For too many people and for too long, we haven&rsquo;t lived up to those ideals.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re inspired and moved</p>
<p>by the passionate people around our nation and around the world</p>
<p>who have stood up to demand change.</p>
<p>We must all aim far higher to build a future that lives up to our ideals.</p>
<p>This means taking action.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, we announced Apple&rsquo;s Racial Equity and Justice Initiative</p>
<p>with a commitment of one hundred million dollars.</p>
<p>Starting in the United States, and expanding over time,</p>
<p>this initiative will challenge systemic barriers</p>
<p>that limit opportunity for communities of color</p>
<p>in the critical areas of education, economic equality and criminal justice.</p>
<p>We also announced something important for this community,</p>
<p>the new Developer Entrepreneur Camp for Black developers.</p>
<p>We want to do everything we can to foster the brightest lights and best ideas.</p>
<p>At Apple, our mission has always been to make the world a better place,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re committed to being a force for change.</p>
<p>Right now our world is also battling a virus</p>
<p>that is affecting the daily lives of billions of people.</p>
<p>We want to thank the dedicated people everywhere,</p>
<p>especially our health-care workers,</p>
<p>who have made tremendous sacrifices to take care of those in need.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also seen the profound impact our products have had.</p>
<p>People are relying on them more than ever to remain connected to family and friends,</p>
<p>to do their work, to express their creativity,</p>
<p>to be entertained as well as to entertain others.</p>
<p>Today the world is counting on all of us,</p>
<p>and on the products and experiences that we create, to move forward.</p>
<p>Because throughout history,</p>
<p>great challenges have been met with great creativity and important breakthroughs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re so excited about this year&rsquo;s conference.</p>
<p>This is going to be truly a unique week,</p>
<p>delivered unlike any that we&rsquo;ve done before.</p>
<p>There will be more than a hundred engineering-led video sessions,</p>
<p>one-on-one consultations with Apple engineers,</p>
<p>developer forums and so much more,</p>
<p>delivered to you from different locations right here at Apple Park.</p>
<p>And this year, the conference will be available</p>
<p>to our entire community of 23 million developers,</p>
<p>as well as anyone who is interested, for free.</p>
<p>Presenting the conference in this way allows us to be more inclusive than ever.</p>
<p>Perhaps this will inspire the next generation of developers.</p>
<p>So even though we can&rsquo;t be together in person,</p>
<p>in some ways we&rsquo;re going to be more together than ever.</p>
<p>Today we&rsquo;re going to push each of our platforms forward</p>
<p>in some exciting and breakthrough ways.</p>
<p>With that, let&rsquo;s get started by sending it over to Craig.</p>
<p>Good morning. Great to have you here.</p>
<p>As you can see, we&rsquo;ve got a lot to cover, so let&rsquo;s get started with iOS.</p>
<p>Together with iPhone,</p>
<p>iOS is central to how we navigate our lives and stay connected.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re making it even more powerful and easier to use.</p>
<p>Our new release is iOS 14.</p>
<p>This year we&rsquo;ve spent time rethinking</p>
<p>some of the most iconic elements of the experience on iPhone.</p>
<p>Now it all started here,</p>
<p>with a carefully considered Home Screen that has truly stood the test of time.</p>
<p>Of course, over the years, we&rsquo;ve kept the fundamentals largely the same</p>
<p>but carefully added features like folders for organizing your apps,</p>
<p>widgets for quick information</p>
<p>and personalized experiences powered by on-device intelligence</p>
<p>that serve up just the right thing at just the right moment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to imagine iPhone without these features now.</p>
<p>Well, that brings us to this year.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing more on our iPhones today than ever before,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ve rethought some of the core elements of iOS to reflect this.</p>
<p>Let me give you a quick peek.</p>
<p>[&ldquo;Like This Like That&rdquo; by BEGINNERS &amp; Night Panda playing]</p>
<p>This is gonna be amazing.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s dig in, starting with the Home Screen.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s Home Screen works great, but as we get more and more apps,</p>
<p>we can end up with this:</p>
<p>lots and lots of pages.</p>
<p>And we tend to forget what&rsquo;s beyond the first couple.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great</p>
<p>if there were a way to organize all of those apps without doing a thing?</p>
<p>Well, this year we&rsquo;re doing just that with something called the App Library.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a new space at the end of your Home Screen pages</p>
<p>that automatically organizes all your apps</p>
<p>in one simple and easy-to-navigate view.</p>
<p>Let me show you.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my Home Screen.</p>
<p>Now, like you, I have muscle memory built for the first page or two,</p>
<p>but when it comes to all of these pages,</p>
<p>well, honestly, I&rsquo;ve lost track of where a lot of things are.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the App Library comes in.</p>
<p>You can see that all of my apps are automatically organized here.</p>
<p>In fact, now with the App Library,</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t need all those pages for all my apps.</p>
<p>So we created an easy way to hide app pages.</p>
<p>I just go into jiggle mode, tap the dots at the bottom,</p>
<p>and check this out,</p>
<p>I get a zoomed-out view of all my app pages.</p>
<p>I can simply tap to hide the pages I no longer need.</p>
<p>Just like that.</p>
<p>And now with those pages hidden,</p>
<p>App Library is always just a swipe or two away.</p>
<p>So here in App Library, getting to the app I&rsquo;m looking for is really easy.</p>
<p>Up at the top I have the Search field,</p>
<p>and I get all my apps organized from A to Z.</p>
<p>Now over here on the upper left I have Suggestions.</p>
<p>It uses on-device intelligence</p>
<p>to show me the apps that I&rsquo;m likely to need next.</p>
<p>And on the right is Recently Added,</p>
<p>giving me access to the apps that I&rsquo;ve recently downloaded from the App Store.</p>
<p>And below are intelligently curated categories.</p>
<p>So I can tap into a category like Apple Arcade</p>
<p>and see all of my apps in that category.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s go back.</p>
<p>You may notice that in each of these categories</p>
<p>the apps I use most are right here at the top level,</p>
<p>so I can launch one of these directly with just a tap.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s App Library.</p>
<p>We think this is gonna make it easier than ever to get to your apps.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s turn to Widgets.</p>
<p>Today, widgets help you get information at a glance.</p>
<p>But a lot has changed since we first introduced these.</p>
<p>Now we have Apple Watch, where we&rsquo;re able to surface so much information</p>
<p>on a small screen that you wear on your wrist.</p>
<p>Well, this year, we&rsquo;re taking all that we&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>to create a completely reimagined experience for widgets.</p>
<p>To start, they&rsquo;re more beautiful and data rich.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re introducing different sizes,</p>
<p>so you can choose one that best fits your needs.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at them in iOS 14.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s swipe over to Today View and take a look at our new widgets.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just beautiful.</p>
<p>And the new designs are more data rich than ever.</p>
<p>And you can see they now come in a variety of sizes.</p>
<p>So you can pick just the right level of information for each one.</p>
<p>Now we like these new widgets so much,</p>
<p>we wanted to make them even more accessible.</p>
<p>So check this out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna tap and hold on the Weather widget,</p>
<p>and I can drag it out of Today View and onto my Home Screen.</p>
<p>And watch, as I move it around,</p>
<p>the apps just dance out of the way to make space for my new widget.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s add a second one.</p>
<p>Just gonna tap the plus here in the upper left</p>
<p>and grab on to Podcasts.</p>
<p>I can drop it just like that.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m gonna swipe over to page 2 here and bring back up the Widget Gallery.</p>
<p>The gallery is a great place to explore widgets.</p>
<p>Now when I tap on one,</p>
<p>I can actually page through all of the different sizes available.</p>
<p>Just like this.</p>
<p>But, you know, right now what I want to do is grab this widget up top.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really special one. It&rsquo;s called the Smart Stack.</p>
<p>Just gonna tap it and drop it here.</p>
<p>With the Smart Stack, I can easily swipe through widgets</p>
<p>to pick just the one I want for the moment.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s really cool</p>
<p>is that the Smart Stack can actually do this for me automatically.</p>
<p>So in the morning, I can get my news briefing.</p>
<p>Throughout the day, find out when I have a meeting coming up.</p>
<p>And in the evening, I might get a summary of my activity for the day.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s widgets on the Home Screen.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re excited to see how everyone will customize them in their own way.</p>
<p>Next, we&rsquo;re also bringing Picture in Picture to iPhone.</p>
<p>So you can access apps on your iPhone</p>
<p>while watching video or talking on a FaceTime call.</p>
<p>Let me show you.</p>
<p>So here on my Home Screen,</p>
<p>the Smart Stack is showing me the TV widget.</p>
<p>So I can just tap to start playing a show.</p>
<p>Now check this out. When I swipe to go Home,</p>
<p>the video automatically goes into Picture in Picture</p>
<p>right over the Home Screen.</p>
<p>And when I launch another app, like Notes, I can keep watching.</p>
<p>Now I can drag the picture to another part of the screen.</p>
<p>If I want to make it bigger, I can even pinch to zoom.</p>
<p>And as I move between applications it stays with me.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s cool is I can also swipe it to the side,</p>
<p>and the audio keeps playing when it&rsquo;s off-screen.</p>
<p>Now here on the Home Screen I can bring it back out if I want.</p>
<p>And I have controls to get back to full-screen playback,</p>
<p>or I can just tap the &ldquo;X&rdquo; to close it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s Picture in Picture video.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great way to continue enjoying your video</p>
<p>while tapping into everything else your iPhone can do for you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a quick look at the updates to the core elements of iOS.</p>
<p>We think these new features are gonna make iOS even more helpful in the moment.</p>
<p>Another iconic experience that&rsquo;s getting a major update is Siri.</p>
<p>As much as Siri has advanced over the years,</p>
<p>the visual interface for interacting with it has remained largely unchanged.</p>
<p>When you use Siri, your iPhone switches to this full-screen UI,</p>
<p>obscuring your current context.</p>
<p>So this year, we&rsquo;ve completely redesigned the Siri experience</p>
<p>with a new compact design.</p>
<p>It makes tasks like launching apps incredibly seamless.</p>
<p>For example, if you say, &ldquo;Open Safari,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Siri pops up at the bottom of the screen and instantly launches the app.</p>
<p>Or if you ask for information, like the weather,</p>
<p>results appear at the top of the screen just like a notification.</p>
<p>Now this is especially great</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s information you want to reference on-screen.</p>
<p>For example, you could ask Siri to add to your grocery list.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the new Siri design in iOS 14.</p>
<p>But the UI is only part of the story.</p>
<p>To tell you more about how we&rsquo;re making Siri smarter than ever,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll hand it off to Yael Garten.</p>
<p>Thanks, Craig.</p>
<p>Siri&rsquo;s getting smarter and even more helpful every day,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m really excited to share the latest updates with you.</p>
<p>Siri helps you in a ton of little ways every day:</p>
<p>playing the morning news, ordering a coffee, getting directions,</p>
<p>setting the alarm before going to bed and so much more.</p>
<p>In fact, Siri&rsquo;s helping so many of you</p>
<p>with a staggering 25 billion requests each month.</p>
<p>And Siri&rsquo;s getting more helpful every day.</p>
<p>Siri&rsquo;s always been great for getting information</p>
<p>and now has over 20 times more facts than just three years ago.</p>
<p>For more complex questions</p>
<p>like &ldquo;How do hybrid cars work?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What causes seasons?&rdquo;,</p>
<p>we recently introduced answers from websites across the Internet,</p>
<p>enabling Siri to help you find even more answers.</p>
<p>Another way Siri helps is with communication, like sending messages.</p>
<p>This year, you can now ask Siri to send an audio message,</p>
<p>and Siri will start recording.</p>
<p>This is great when you really want to have the emotion of your voice come through.</p>
<p>Another popular way to send messages with your voice is using dictation.</p>
<p>Keyboard Dictation uses the same speech recognition as Siri.</p>
<p>And leveraging the power of the Neural Engine,</p>
<p>we are now able to run dictation on-device.</p>
<p>This provides great accuracy and privacy.</p>
<p>When communicating with someone in another language, Siri can help with translations.</p>
<p>This year we&rsquo;re expanding to support many new language pairs.</p>
<p>This is hugely popular,</p>
<p>but we know our users want more than just translating phrases.</p>
<p>They want to have entire conversations.</p>
<p>And we believe conversations between languages</p>
<p>should feel natural and easy and have the ability to stay private.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re introducing a new app called Translate.</p>
<p>It is designed to be the best and easiest-to-use app for conversations.</p>
<p>And it can work completely off-line, keeping your conversations private.</p>
<p>Using advanced on-device machine learning and the powerful Neural Engine,</p>
<p>you can translate your text and voice</p>
<p>between any combination of these 11 languages.</p>
<p>So I could have a conversation with someone in Mandarin,</p>
<p>and they could have a conversation with someone in Russian.</p>
<p>Just tap on the microphone and say, &ldquo;What are your store hours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>[Siri reads Spanish translation]</p>
<p>[Yael] You get back the text and audio right away.</p>
<p>And just turn the phone to landscape to open conversation mode.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve designed a side-by-side view</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s easy for two people to know which side to follow in the conversation.</p>
<p>This mode is incredibly intuitive, with just a single microphone button</p>
<p>because the app intelligently detects the language spoken</p>
<p>and shows translation on the correct side of the screen.</p>
<p>Translate will make communicating between languages easier than ever before,</p>
<p>connecting people in new ways.</p>
<p>And we can&rsquo;t wait for you to try it.</p>
<p>Thanks, Yael.</p>
<p>Next up, Messages.</p>
<p>Messages is how many of us communicate with people most important to us.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re using it more than ever.</p>
<p>Compared to just a year ago,</p>
<p>we have a record number of users sending a record number of messages.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve seen people use Messages more and more</p>
<p>to keep in touch with their closest groups.</p>
<p>This year, we&rsquo;re introducing</p>
<p>a new way to stay connected with your most important conversations,</p>
<p>giving you new ways to express your identity with Memoji</p>
<p>and making big changes to how we communicate in groups.</p>
<p>To tell you more, here&rsquo;s Stacey Lysik.</p>
<p>Thanks, Craig.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s get started with Conversations.</p>
<p>From the beginning, Messages was designed</p>
<p>to make it really easy to get to your newest messages.</p>
<p>But with so many active conversations,</p>
<p>sometimes it can be tough to get to the ones that are most important to you.</p>
<p>So we are introducing a new way</p>
<p>to let you stay connected to your most important conversations:</p>
<p>by letting you pin them at the top of your list</p>
<p>so you can always get to them.</p>
<p>And you can see messages as they come in with a beautiful animation on the pin.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s talk about expressing yourself with Memoji.</p>
<p>There are over one trillion ways to customize your identity with Memoji.</p>
<p>In iOS 14, we&rsquo;re adding even more ways to create your look</p>
<p>with over 20 new hair and headwear styles</p>
<p>to let you reflect your hobby, profession and personality.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also added something that&rsquo;s even more relevant today: face coverings.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re adding more age options too.</p>
<p>My favorite way of using Memoji is with Memoji stickers.</p>
<p>And now we have three brand-new Memoji stickers</p>
<p>that let you send a hug, a fist bump or even a blush to your friends.</p>
<p>Last, let&rsquo;s chat about groups.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re talking to a group, sometimes there&rsquo;s so much going on,</p>
<p>it can be hard to keep track of the conversation.</p>
<p>So this year, we&rsquo;re gonna help you bring order to the chaos.</p>
<p>First we&rsquo;re adding inline replies</p>
<p>that let you reply directly to a specific message.</p>
<p>You can view replies in the full conversation</p>
<p>or you can view them as their own thread so you can focus in on the specific topic.</p>
<p>To make it even more clear who a message was meant for,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re introducing mentions.</p>
<p>With mentions, you can just type someone&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>to direct a message to them.</p>
<p>And now you have the ability to only be notified</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re mentioned in the group conversation.</p>
<p>And check out the top of this conversation.</p>
<p>We have an all-new design for how groups appear.</p>
<p>It lets you see all the members of your group,</p>
<p>where the most recently active people are shown largest.</p>
<p>And, for the first time ever,</p>
<p>you can create a unique visual identity for your group</p>
<p>by setting a group photo</p>
<p>or customizing your group&rsquo;s look with an emoji.</p>
<p>Inside the conversation</p>
<p>you see group members&rsquo; photos around the image.</p>
<p>Of course it looks great as a pin.</p>
<p>You know who&rsquo;s most recently commented in the group</p>
<p>because their photo will appear around the outside of the pin.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s coming to Messages in iOS 14:</p>
<p>all-new pinned conversations, fun updates to Memoji</p>
<p>and powerful improvements to groups.</p>
<p>Thanks, Stacey.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s take a look at features that help us while we&rsquo;re out and about.</p>
<p>Now we know that life looks very different for many of us right now,</p>
<p>but it won&rsquo;t always be this way.</p>
<p>And as things start to open up,</p>
<p>we have a new set of features that will help us explore the world again,</p>
<p>starting with Maps.</p>
<p>Apple Maps is the best way to navigate and explore the world,</p>
<p>all while protecting your privacy.</p>
<p>Over the past several years, we&rsquo;ve added many great features,</p>
<p>and of course we&rsquo;ve been rebuilding our map from the ground up.</p>
<p>Our new map finished rolling out across the US earlier this year</p>
<p>and brought with it better navigation and far richer detail</p>
<p>for roads, pedestrian paths, landcover and more.</p>
<p>The new map also offers more accurate information for places</p>
<p>and allows us to build incredible features like Look Around.</p>
<p>Maps has come a long way, and people have noticed.</p>
<p>Just look at this quote from Fast Company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apple Maps has improved by leaps and bounds</p>
<p>and is a formidable rival to Google Maps.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also arguably got the better UI,</p>
<p>and by far&ndash; by far&ndash; the better privacy policy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re excited to announce</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re bringing our new map to more countries later this year,</p>
<p>including the UK, Ireland and Canada.</p>
<p>In addition to the rich detail and improved accuracy,</p>
<p>the new map serves as the foundation for many great new features.</p>
<p>In iOS 14, we&rsquo;re adding things</p>
<p>that will make it easier for people to find places they love</p>
<p>and help them get to where they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>in ways that are better for the environment.</p>
<p>To tell you more, I&rsquo;ll hand it off to Meg Frost.</p>
<p>Thanks, Craig.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s talk about finding great places.</p>
<p>We have millions of people coming to Maps every day</p>
<p>to discover great new places,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re planning their next big vacation</p>
<p>or just looking for something to eat nearby.</p>
<p>In iOS 14,</p>
<p>the Maps team will be working with some of the world&rsquo;s most trusted brands</p>
<p>to offer amazing Guides.</p>
<p>Guides for great places to eat, shop,</p>
<p>meet friends or explore in cities around the world.</p>
<p>You can save Guides so you can easily get back to them later,</p>
<p>and the best part is they automatically update when new places are added,</p>
<p>so you always have the latest recommendations.</p>
<p>In addition to helping you discover great new places,</p>
<p>Maps helps you get there in a way that&rsquo;s better for the planet.</p>
<p>For years, Maps has made it easy to navigate</p>
<p>using environmentally-friendly options like public transit and walking.</p>
<p>With iOS 14, we&rsquo;re introducing great new features</p>
<p>to help our users reduce their carbon footprint,</p>
<p>and our first one is also our most requested:</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Cycling.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve built an incredible cycling experience</p>
<p>that helps you get around town on your bike.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re adding a dedicated cycling option to Maps</p>
<p>which allows users to ride their bike along bike lanes, paths and roads.</p>
<p>Maps takes elevation into account</p>
<p>to let you know if you&rsquo;re in for a challenging uphill workout</p>
<p>or a leisurely flat ride.</p>
<p>You can also see if your route includes quiet or busy roads.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll even let you know if you have a steep passage coming up</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;ll need to carry your bike up the stairs.</p>
<p>You can also choose to avoid stairs altogether.</p>
<p>With iOS 14, we&rsquo;re bringing cycling to New York City, LA,</p>
<p>the San Francisco Bay Area,</p>
<p>along with a number of cities in China like Shanghai and Beijing.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll be adding many more cities in the coming months.</p>
<p>For environmentally conscious drivers, we&rsquo;re also introducing EV routing.</p>
<p>If you have an electric car,</p>
<p>Maps is going to help eliminate range anxiety.</p>
<p>With iOS 14, Maps will track your current charge</p>
<p>and factor in things like elevation and weather</p>
<p>to automatically add charging stops along your route.</p>
<p>And Maps will know which type of charger works for your car,</p>
<p>making sure to only route you to compatible stations.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re working with a number of manufacturers</p>
<p>to support EV routing in their vehicles,</p>
<p>including BMW and Ford,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll be adding many more in the near future.</p>
<p>Cities around the world are also working to improve air quality and reduce traffic,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re adding congestion and green zones to Maps</p>
<p>to easily see where they are along with alternate routing options.</p>
<p>In addition, drivers in China</p>
<p>can securely store their license plate number on their iPhone,</p>
<p>and Maps will let them know which days they can enter congested city centers</p>
<p>based on that number.</p>
<p>And those are just some of the great new features</p>
<p>coming to Apple Maps in iOS 14,</p>
<p>making Maps the best product</p>
<p>to help users explore and navigate their world.</p>
<p>Thanks, Meg.</p>
<p>And now, on to CarPlay,</p>
<p>which has transformed the driving experience for iPhone owners</p>
<p>by being the smarter, safer way to use the apps you love in your car.</p>
<p>CarPlay is everywhere, and it&rsquo;s incredibly popular.</p>
<p>Here in the US, it&rsquo;s available on basically every new car.</p>
<p>And worldwide, it&rsquo;s available on over 80% of new cars sold</p>
<p>and has quickly become the default in-car experience for so many people.</p>
<p>People love CarPlay, and we get some really passionate reactions.</p>
<p>Joanna Stern says it makes her life &ldquo;infinitely better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have some great updates for iOS 14.</p>
<p>First up, we have new wallpaper options perfect for the car.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re adding support for new categories of CarPlay apps:</p>
<p>parking, EV charging and quick food ordering.</p>
<p>In addition to this, we&rsquo;re really excited for the next step</p>
<p>in how we&rsquo;re transforming your relationship with your car</p>
<p>by rethinking car keys.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been around for over a hundred years,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve become big, bulky and ripe for reimagining.</p>
<p>To tell you more about what we have planned,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go to the garage with Emily Schubert.</p>
<p>Thanks, Craig.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to introduce a digital version of car keys.</p>
<p>Now you can leave your keys at home</p>
<p>and unlock and start your car with your iPhone.</p>
<p>And the very first car to support this will be the new 2021 BMW 5 Series.</p>
<p>Let me show you how it works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super simple.</p>
<p>-It uses NFC, and you just tap to unlock. -[beeps]</p>
<p>And I place my phone on the charging pad and then push to start.</p>
<p>[chimes]</p>
<p>But this goes beyond just one less thing you have to keep in your pocket.</p>
<p>Digital keys have security benefits.</p>
<p>They live in the Secure Element of your iPhone,</p>
<p>and if it goes missing, you can turn off your keys remotely via iCloud.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re even easier to share than a physical key.</p>
<p>Copies don&rsquo;t involve trips to the dealership.</p>
<p>And you can share from wherever you are with iMessage.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s give Craig a key so he can drive home after we&rsquo;re done here.</p>
<p>With each key you share, you can set options,</p>
<p>like a restricted driving profile, perfect for teen drivers.</p>
<p>Which is tempting,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll give Craig full access.</p>
<p>[phone chimes]</p>
<p>-[phone chimes] -Full access? Thanks, Emily.</p>
<p>The new BMW will be available to customers next month.</p>
<p>In addition to adding this feature to iOS 14,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re also enabling it in iOS 13,</p>
<p>so customers can use their car keys even sooner.</p>
<p>Of course, we want this to work in any car,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ve been working on standards with industry groups.</p>
<p>And this is just the beginning.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re working on technology that will leverage our U1 chip,</p>
<p>which uses Ultra Wideband technology for precise spatial awareness.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll be able to leave your iPhone in your bag or pocket</p>
<p>and still securely unlock and start your car.</p>
<p>We expect to see support for this standard starting in new cars next year.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s turn to the App Store.</p>
<p>Twelve years ago,</p>
<p>we revolutionized the industry with the launch of the App Store.</p>
<p>Today we have so many amazing apps that offer a rich set of experiences,</p>
<p>we can truly say that for everything we want to do,</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an app for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So now it&rsquo;s time for us to extend the success of the App Store</p>
<p>and make apps available and accessible in whole new ways.</p>
<p>What if you could have the right app you needed at just the right moment?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at what it would be like if you did.</p>
<p>[narrator] Today, no matter what you want to do,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an app for that.</p>
<p>But what if you don&rsquo;t have the app you need right when you need it?</p>
<p>Like when you need to pay for parking. Well, now there&rsquo;s an App Clip for that.</p>
<p>[car chirps]</p>
<p>Ooh. Look, a new coffee shop.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an App Clip for that.</p>
<p>Or a friend sends you a message with a print you like.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an App Clip for that.</p>
<p>That looks nice.</p>
<p>Looking for somewhere to eat nearby? App Clip.</p>
<p>Very health conscious of you.</p>
<p>Hey, there&rsquo;s a scooter. Let&rsquo;s take it for a spin.</p>
<p>Yep. App Clip.</p>
<p>Mmm. Ice cream. Wait. There isn&rsquo;t one for that yet?</p>
<p>Well, soon there could be an App Clip for that.</p>
<p>And that.</p>
<p>And that.</p>
<p>And that.</p>
<p>-And that. -[martial artist] Hi-yah!</p>
<p>An App Clip is a small part of an app.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s light and fast and easy to discover,</p>
<p>so you can quickly get what you need right when you need it.</p>
<p>Everything about App Clips is designed for speed.</p>
<p>They start with this card which quickly pops up.</p>
<p>And with just a tap, you can launch the App Clip.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to enter credit card numbers</p>
<p>because App Clips can use Apple Pay for payments.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t have to manually log into an account</p>
<p>because it can take advantage of Sign in with Apple.</p>
<p>App Clips won&rsquo;t clutter your Home Screen</p>
<p>and will only stay along as long as you need them.</p>
<p>But you can easily launch recently used App Clips from the new App Library.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always easy to download the full app,</p>
<p>and this makes App Clips an easy way to discover</p>
<p>more of what the App Store has to offer.</p>
<p>And discovery is key.</p>
<p>App Clips are all about getting to a part of an app at the moment you need it,</p>
<p>so it was critical that we made them really easy to find.</p>
<p>App Clips can be easily discovered and launched from the web.</p>
<p>You can launch App Clips from Messages when friends share them with you.</p>
<p>When you want to order takeout from a restaurant in Maps,</p>
<p>you can launch an App Clip right from a place card.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be able to tap on NFC tags out in the world, on things like parking meters.</p>
<p>Or you can scan QR codes</p>
<p>to launch App Clips that work with products you purchase.</p>
<p>The best way to discover App Clips will be with the new Apple-designed App Clip code.</p>
<p>So when you see one, you&rsquo;ll know that there&rsquo;s an App Clip waiting for you.</p>
<p>They incorporate both a visual code and NFC,</p>
<p>so you tap on them or scan them with the camera to bring up an App Clip.</p>
<p>App Clips will be great for businesses that already have apps.</p>
<p>But we want to be able to use App Clips everywhere,</p>
<p>including smaller spots that may not have their own app.</p>
<p>So we made it possible for apps like Yelp, which support multiple businesses,</p>
<p>to create App Clip experiences for each of the places they work with.</p>
<p>Developers will create App Clips from a part of an app,</p>
<p>using Xcode and the full power of the SDK.</p>
<p>To ensure that they launch quickly,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll need to be less than 10 megabytes in size.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s App Clips.</p>
<p>Immediately discoverable,</p>
<p>small in size, so they launch fast,</p>
<p>integrated Apple Pay for easy payment,</p>
<p>Sign in with Apple for quick and privacy-friendly login</p>
<p>and the option to download the full app from the App Store</p>
<p>when you want to keep it around.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t wait to see all the App Clips developers will create.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s iOS 14.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge release that transforms the core experience of iPhone,</p>
<p>with redesigned widgets right on the Home Screen</p>
<p>and a new way to organize your apps with the App Library.</p>
<p>It adds incredible updates to some of the most popular apps,</p>
<p>with powerful improvements to Messages and Maps,</p>
<p>and introduces a whole new way to tap into apps</p>
<p>with App Clips.</p>
<p>And next up, iPadOS.</p>
<p>[&ldquo;S.S. Luker&rsquo;s Mom&rdquo; by Oh Sees playing]</p>
<p>Oh, hey, we made it.</p>
<p>All right. Well, let&rsquo;s jump right in.</p>
<p>iPadOS builds on all the amazing features of iOS</p>
<p>while adding unique capabilities</p>
<p>that deliver a distinct experience for iPad.</p>
<p>Like using Apple Pencil for taking notes, markup and illustration.</p>
<p>A reimagined track pad experience</p>
<p>that lets you interact with iPad in a whole new way.</p>
<p>And unmatched AR experiences with ARKit</p>
<p>and the amazing new LiDAR Scanner in iPad Pro.</p>
<p>All of this combines to put iPad into a class of its own.</p>
<p>iPad excels at &ldquo;every type of input&rdquo;</p>
<p>and is a &ldquo;product to do anything and everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which brings us to this year and our new release, iPadOS 14.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with experience.</p>
<p>This year iPadOS delivers unique made-for-iPad designs</p>
<p>that take great advantage of the iPad&rsquo;s large, multi-touch display.</p>
<p>Now iPad has always been about the apps.</p>
<p>In the beginning, we focused on giving the ecosystem of iPhone apps</p>
<p>a larger canvas to deliver new and unique experiences.</p>
<p>This quickly sparked an entirely new set of apps,</p>
<p>designed for iPad first,</p>
<p>with immersive experiences</p>
<p>that transform this magical sheet of glass</p>
<p>into whatever you needed it to be.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re proud of the over one million apps on the App Store today</p>
<p>designed just for iPad.</p>
<p>With customers continuing to push their iPads further than ever before,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re extending the design language of iPad</p>
<p>to make apps more streamlined and more powerful.</p>
<p>To give you a live look at these enhancements,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll hand it over to Josh Shaffer.</p>
<p>Thanks, Craig.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at some of the enhancements to iPadOS.</p>
<p>The first thing that you&rsquo;ll notice</p>
<p>are the same redesigned widgets that you saw in iOS 14.</p>
<p>They look great on iPad as well,</p>
<p>and they give you information at a glance whenever you go Home.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s see some of the improvements in the apps, starting with Photos.</p>
<p>iPad is the perfect device for browsing your photos.</p>
<p>Its large canvas lets you immerse yourself in all your favorite memories.</p>
<p>And this year, we&rsquo;re making it even easier to browse and organize your photos</p>
<p>with an all-new sidebar.</p>
<p>With just a tap of this button, I can reveal the sidebar,</p>
<p>with all the core functionality of the app in a single location.</p>
<p>My photos remain front and center,</p>
<p>but now I can quickly tap to move between parts of the app.</p>
<p>The sidebar is a really powerful way to organize your photos too.</p>
<p>I can easily drag a photo to the sidebar</p>
<p>and then just drop it to add it to an album.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve brought this sidebar to many apps across iPadOS.</p>
<p>Like Notes,</p>
<p>where it provides quick and easy access to all your folders.</p>
<p>And Files, where we&rsquo;ve consolidated navigation into the sidebar</p>
<p>for a streamlined new design.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also streamlined the toolbars,</p>
<p>adding new drop-down menus that consolidate functions</p>
<p>into a single, easy-to-access button.</p>
<p>I can just tap to change views like this.</p>
<p>And for even quicker access,</p>
<p>I can just tap and drag to change the sort order, all in a single motion.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find this same approach across other apps, like Calendar,</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;ve brought controls into a single toolbar at the top,</p>
<p>providing more space for your content</p>
<p>and a single unified place to access all the app&rsquo;s functionality.</p>
<p>Finally, Music has been updated</p>
<p>to take even better advantage of iPad&rsquo;s large screen.</p>
<p>The sidebar in Music makes it easy to move between views.</p>
<p>I can quickly jump between the new Listen Now and my playlists.</p>
<p>-And once I start playing a song&hellip; -[&ldquo;Caution&rdquo; by The Killers playing]</p>
<p>&hellip;I can bring up the brand-new full-screen player,</p>
<p>where I can see rich album art, transport controls and lyrics,</p>
<p>-all in one single view. -[song fades]</p>
<p>And these are just some of the enhancements</p>
<p>that are coming to apps in iPadOS.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re really loving these new app designs.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s more,</p>
<p>starting with Siri.</p>
<p>The new compact Siri design that you heard about in iOS 14</p>
<p>is especially useful on iPad.</p>
<p>Results appear at the bottom right corner,</p>
<p>allowing you to easily reference the app while using Siri.</p>
<p>And we applied this same approach to other parts of the experience&hellip;</p>
<p>like calls.</p>
<p>Now today when you receive a call on iPad, you see this.</p>
<p>[beeps]</p>
<p>Whatever you were working on is suddenly completely covered</p>
<p>with the incoming call screen.</p>
<p>Not cool.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nicer if instead you saw this?</p>
<p>[beeps]</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s much better.</p>
<p>Now an incoming call is presented with a compact notification</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t take you out of context.</p>
<p>And you can simply tap to answer or flick it away to dismiss.</p>
<p>And this applies to all calls, including those from your iPhone</p>
<p>or third-party VoIP apps like Skype.</p>
<p>[rings]</p>
<p>And of course we&rsquo;re bringing this to iOS as well.</p>
<p>We think our iPhone customers are going to love it.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s one more key experience we&rsquo;ve redesigned for iPad this year,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s Search.</p>
<p>Today Search is a full-screen experience,</p>
<p>and sometimes you can lose track of your context.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve redesigned Search with a new, compact design.</p>
<p>You can start a search from anywhere, like the Home Screen</p>
<p>or over any app.</p>
<p>And this makes it easy to find what you need</p>
<p>without feeling like you&rsquo;ve left the app you&rsquo;re working in.</p>
<p>But we didn&rsquo;t just redesign it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve rebuilt Search from the ground up to be Universal,</p>
<p>becoming a single destination where you can start all of your searches.</p>
<p>First, we made it better than ever as an app launcher.</p>
<p>You just start typing a few characters,</p>
<p>and you can instantly get to where you&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also great for finding contacts to message or call</p>
<p>or documents.</p>
<p>You can even search directly into apps like Keynote, Messages, Mail or Files.</p>
<p>Or look up information about people or places.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also a great place to start all of your web searches as well.</p>
<p>As soon as you start typing,</p>
<p>you get relevant suggestions to complete your search.</p>
<p>And you can get to your web search results with just a tap.</p>
<p>And Search now makes navigating to your favorite websites</p>
<p>just as easy as launching an app.</p>
<p>Just type a few letters and the top hit will take you right to Safari.</p>
<p>So those are some of our updates to the iPad experience.</p>
<p>And of course, you also get the new widgets</p>
<p>and all the other great app enhancements from iOS 14.</p>
<p>Next, we want to push forward your ability to express yourself creatively</p>
<p>with improvements to Apple Pencil.</p>
<p>Apple Pencil is a game-changing tool</p>
<p>that turns iPad into a professional drawing canvas,</p>
<p>a great way to mark up and sign documents</p>
<p>and the ultimate note-taking device.</p>
<p>What many people love most about taking notes with Apple Pencil</p>
<p>is how they can express themselves in a free-form way.</p>
<p>Mixing handwriting and drawings can be the best way to capture your thoughts.</p>
<p>Now the challenge is when you want to change things afterwards.</p>
<p>Here, working with handwriting just isn&rsquo;t as easy as with typed text.</p>
<p>Now, we sometimes take it for granted,</p>
<p>but with typed text it&rsquo;s so easy to select,</p>
<p>copy and paste into another document,</p>
<p>or even just make space for more text.</p>
<p>Well, this year, we&rsquo;re going to make handwriting just as easy</p>
<p>and just as powerful.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not all.</p>
<p>Our customers tell us that once they have an Apple Pencil in their hand,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want to put it away.</p>
<p>So this year, we&rsquo;re bringing Scribble to iPad.</p>
<p>So you can handwrite into any text field,</p>
<p>and it will automatically be converted to text.</p>
<p>To show you all of this in action,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to welcome Jenny Chen for a live demo.</p>
<p>Thanks, Craig.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really excited to show you some great new features we have</p>
<p>for Apple Pencil and iPadOS this year.</p>
<p>One of the great parts about taking notes with the Apple Pencil</p>
<p>is that it really lets you work in a free-form way.</p>
<p>I can just start writing anywhere.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just about text.</p>
<p>I can also express myself with drawings or shapes.</p>
<p>But sometimes you want that more professional, cleaned-up look.</p>
<p>So now, when I draw a simple shape and pause at the end,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll automatically convert to that ideal shape.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re smart about it, retaining the same size</p>
<p>and angle that you drew it at.</p>
<p>In addition to shapes,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve also made huge improvements to our handwriting recognition.</p>
<p>So now, when I write, I can easily make a selection</p>
<p>using the same gestures that I use for typed text.</p>
<p>I can double tap to select a word or double tap again to select a line.</p>
<p>Thanks to our advanced, on-device machine learning,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll notice how we can select the handwriting</p>
<p>while avoiding the drawings nearby.</p>
<p>Now that I have the selection,</p>
<p>I can easily change the color or move it around the document.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also perfectly easy for me to make space for more room to write.</p>
<p>We think that this will make note-taking with the Apple Pencil even better.</p>
<p>Now, you don&rsquo;t even have to put it down when you want to do something else.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you want to search for &ldquo;Edison bulbs&rdquo; in Safari.</p>
<p>Using Scribble, I can just write directly into the text field&hellip;</p>
<p>and it automatically gets converted to typed text.</p>
<p>It also works in any text field,</p>
<p>so I can easily add a new Reminder</p>
<p>to my shared Reminders list with my husband.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also been learning Chinese,</p>
<p>so I want to surprise him with some of my progress and skills.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll use Scratch to delete &ldquo;lights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then I can use Scribble to write &ldquo;new&rdquo; and then &ldquo;light fixture&rdquo; in Chinese.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice how Scribble recognizes both English and Chinese in the same line.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s awesome is that we can build on this technology</p>
<p>to deliver other great features, like Data Detectors.</p>
<p>We can automatically detect what you write,</p>
<p>like phone numbers, so I can make a phone call.</p>
<p>Or addresses, so I can look up directions.</p>
<p>We can use these features together to do even more with your handwriting.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I wanted to use my handwriting in another app.</p>
<p>I can easily select what I want,</p>
<p>tap the new Copy as Text from the callout bar,</p>
<p>and then paste it into an app like Pages.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s automatically converted to typed text.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re really excited about these awesome new features.</p>
<p>And we think it will let you do even more with the Apple Pencil.</p>
<p>Thanks, Jenny.</p>
<p>So those are the enhancements to Pencil.</p>
<p>Just one part of an amazing release,</p>
<p>with Scribble for handwriting into any text field,</p>
<p>a whole new way to work with your handwritten notes,</p>
<p>broad enhancements to the app experience,</p>
<p>and of course, iPad users also benefit</p>
<p>from the great features you already saw in iOS 14</p>
<p>and much more that we didn&rsquo;t have time to talk about.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s iOS and iPadOS.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s talk about AirPods.</p>
<p>From the one-click setup</p>
<p>to the automatic pairing with all your devices</p>
<p>to how they pause your audio when you take them out,</p>
<p>people love the magical experience that AirPods deliver.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re bringing even more magic to AirPods.</p>
<p>To tell you all about it, here&rsquo;s Mary-Ann Ionascu.</p>
<p>Thanks, Craig.</p>
<p>We have some amazing updates coming to AirPods,</p>
<p>starting with Automatic Switching.</p>
<p>AirPods will now seamlessly move between your devices</p>
<p>without you having to manually switch them.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you just finished listening to a podcast</p>
<p>and you pick up your iPad to watch a show.</p>
<p>AirPods will magically switch over.</p>
<p>And later you start a video conference on your Mac.</p>
<p>AirPods will automatically switch again.</p>
<p>-[ringing] -And if a phone call comes in,</p>
<p>the audio in your AirPods will route right back to your phone.</p>
<p>We also have an exciting new feature coming to AirPods Pro:</p>
<p>spatial audio.</p>
<p>You know the experience of being in a movie theater</p>
<p>with a state-of-the-art surround sound system,</p>
<p>one where the sound not only comes from in front of you&hellip;</p>
<p>-[tone pulsing] -&hellip;but also from the left, the right,</p>
<p>behind, and even from above you?</p>
<p>Well, we are thrilled to bring that same immersive experience to AirPods Pro.</p>
<p>But it turns out it&rsquo;s a lot harder to do</p>
<p>when you only have a single earbud in each ear.</p>
<p>So our team created advanced spatial audio algorithms for AirPods Pro</p>
<p>that replicate the movie theater experience.</p>
<p>By applying directional audio filters</p>
<p>and subtly adjusting the frequencies each ear receives,</p>
<p>we can place sounds virtually anywhere in space&hellip;</p>
<p>[high-speed vehicles passing]</p>
<p>&hellip;creating an immersive surround sound experience.</p>
<p>But to truly deliver on this promise, we had to factor in real-life situations.</p>
<p>First, people move their heads.</p>
<p>For an authentic surround sound experience,</p>
<p>you need the sound field to stay fixed</p>
<p>so the voice feels like it&rsquo;s coming from the actor</p>
<p>and not some random point in space.</p>
<p>So we use the accelerometer and gyroscopes in AirPods Pro</p>
<p>to track the motion of your head,</p>
<p>remapping the sound field so it stays anchored to your device,</p>
<p>even as your head moves.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not only your head that can move,</p>
<p>but you might move your iPad or iPhone as well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we constantly compare the motion data</p>
<p>from your head and your screen</p>
<p>to understand how they are moving in relation to each other.</p>
<p>So if your bus turns the corner or your plane banks,</p>
<p>the sound stays in sync.</p>
<p>The result is a surround sound experience</p>
<p>that keeps you in the middle of the action,</p>
<p>no matter where you go.</p>
<p>Spatial audio for AirPods Pro will work with content encoded in 5.1, 7.1,</p>
<p>and even Dolby Atmos.</p>
<p>Thanks, Mary-Ann.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using the new spatial audio,</p>
<p>and I think you&rsquo;re all really gonna love it.</p>
<p>All right. Next let&rsquo;s head to the Fitness Center</p>
<p>to hear the latest on watchOS from Kevin.</p>
<p>[&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Getting Tired&rdquo; by Jacknife Lee playing]</p>
<p>[song ends]</p>
<p>Thanks, Craig. Since we launched Apple Watch,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s completely redefined what a watch can do,</p>
<p>and this has been incredibly meaningful work.</p>
<p>Apple Watch not only helps you stay connected and active,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s become an intelligent guardian of your health,</p>
<p>enabling you to take an ECG, detect falls and call emergency services for you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impacting lives in ways that were inconceivable five years ago.</p>
<p>The power of Apple Watch is not only its built-in features,</p>
<p>but how developers have personalized it for you.</p>
<p>We introduced the App Store in watchOS 6,</p>
<p>and there are now over 20,000 watchOS apps available.</p>
<p>These apps bring the information you care about most</p>
<p>to just a glance at your watch face.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re taking this even further in watchOS 7,</p>
<p>starting with complications.</p>
<p>Until today, an app could appear in only one spot at a time on a watch face.</p>
<p>In watchOS 7 developers can enable multiple complications,</p>
<p>making even more richly personal watch faces.</p>
<p>So if you like to use Dawn Patrol for surfing,</p>
<p>you can create your own surf watch,</p>
<p>including water temperature, swell and wind speed predictions</p>
<p>for your favorite beach.</p>
<p>Or new parents can use Glow Baby</p>
<p>to see nap, changing and feeding times all on one face.</p>
<p>While Nike Run Club can display stats like pace from your last run</p>
<p>and your weekly run goals.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also bringing rich complications to more faces,</p>
<p>including a fresh Chronograph face</p>
<p>with an integrated tachymeter</p>
<p>and an updated Extra Large face</p>
<p>with a huge, rich complication right in the center.</p>
<p>And Configuring Watch Faces has been redesigned</p>
<p>so you can easily select which information you&rsquo;d like to see.</p>
<p>As developers, with watchOS 7</p>
<p>you can now build your rich complications with native SwiftUI.</p>
<p>While there are so many ways to configure watch faces,</p>
<p>you may not have yet gone in and set these up for yourself yet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>With watchOS 7 we&rsquo;re making it super easy to share watch faces,</p>
<p>so you can discover a face that works perfectly for you.</p>
<p>To do this, we&rsquo;re introducing Face Sharing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be able to discover curated faces with third-party apps on the App Store,</p>
<p>or discover a new favorite watch face right on a website,</p>
<p>or receive watch faces directly from friends and family.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at how this works.</p>
<p>When you see a watch face you&rsquo;d like, you just press &ldquo;Add Apple Watch Face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the watch face uses some apps that you don&rsquo;t have yet,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be offered each one right here so you can easily get them if you like.</p>
<p>And the new face appears right on your watch.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to share a face you&rsquo;ve created yourself,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also really easy.</p>
<p>Just long press on the face,</p>
<p>tap &ldquo;Share,&rdquo; pick a contact and send.</p>
<p>Developers can offer preconfigured watch faces right from their apps.</p>
<p>You can even share watch faces across social media.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great way for the community of Apple Watch wearers to connect</p>
<p>and help each other discover all the amazing things Apple Watch is capable of.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s talk about Maps.</p>
<p>Maps is great for walking, driving and transit directions,</p>
<p>and now in watchOS, just like in iOS 14,</p>
<p>you can get cycling directions.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see a variety of routes</p>
<p>with information like time, distance</p>
<p>and whether there are bike lanes.</p>
<p>You can preview travel time and elevation changes</p>
<p>and navigate with turn-by-turn directions that are large and easy to read.</p>
<p>Maps can direct you to dismount and walk your bike</p>
<p>or even take the stairs to save time.</p>
<p>You can also search for and add places optimized for cyclists,</p>
<p>like bike repair shops.</p>
<p>[chimes]</p>
<p>Now to tell you about how we&rsquo;re advancing Workouts,</p>
<p>please welcome Julz Arney.</p>
<p>Thanks, Kevin.</p>
<p>The Workout app uses algorithms that are smartly tuned</p>
<p>to track all aspects of your training.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the most used apps on Apple Watch,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve continued to add support for new workout types every year.</p>
<p>-And in watchOS 7 we&rsquo;re adding Dance. -[dance music playing]</p>
<p>Dance is a total body workout that&rsquo;s great for your heart.</p>
<p>It makes you more fit and flexible, and you&rsquo;re guaranteed to have fun.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re doing Hip Hop, Latin, Bollywood, or simply Cardio Dance,</p>
<p>the Workout app now tracks</p>
<p>some of the world&rsquo;s most popular styles of dance for fitness.</p>
<p>Getting the most accurate credit for Dance presented a unique challenge.</p>
<p>Arm movements aren&rsquo;t always repetitive or synchronized with leg movements</p>
<p>like in running and walking.</p>
<p>The solution was to use advanced sensor fusion.</p>
<p>[music continues]</p>
<p>In Dance, we combine data from the accelerometer and the gyroscope</p>
<p>to detect the difference between dancing with just your arms&hellip;</p>
<p>just your lower body&hellip;</p>
<p>or when you put it all together and dance with your entire body.</p>
<p>Then we add in heart rate data</p>
<p>for the most accurate calorie burn calculations.</p>
<p>watchOS 7 also tracks accurate calories for Core Training,</p>
<p>those exercises for your abs and back,</p>
<p>Functional Strength Training,</p>
<p>a workout type that helps you get stronger and move better for everyday activities,</p>
<p>and also Cooldowns</p>
<p>to add on to another workout</p>
<p>when you want to continue with easy moves and stretches</p>
<p>as you bring your heart rate and breathing back to normal.</p>
<p>Of course, you can track your progress for any of these new workouts</p>
<p>inside the Activity app on iPhone,</p>
<p>which is completely redesigned in watchOS 7.</p>
<p>The app now features a new Summary tab</p>
<p>that gives you an easy way to see your activity history,</p>
<p>workouts and trends, all in one seamless view.</p>
<p>With a new focus on easy navigation and summary metrics,</p>
<p>the app is getting a new name as well:</p>
<p>[music continues]</p>
<p>Fitness.</p>
<p>Back to you, Kevin.</p>
<p>-[record scratches] -[music ends]</p>
<p>Thanks, Julz.</p>
<p>Apple Watch helps you meet not only your fitness goals,</p>
<p>but also helps support your health</p>
<p>with features such as Cycle Tracking, the Breathe app, and Noise notifications.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to be adding even more capabilities this year in watchOS 7.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d like to share a couple of them with you today,</p>
<p>starting with one of the most-requested features for Apple Watch:</p>
<p>tracking your sleep.</p>
<p>To tell you about this, over to Vera Carr.</p>
<p>Thanks, Kevin.</p>
<p>There are many ways to look at sleep: scores, advanced monitoring,</p>
<p>or sleep cycle analysis.</p>
<p>We are taking a more holistic approach to sleep</p>
<p>by leveraging the devices you use every day</p>
<p>to not only track your sleep</p>
<p>but to support you in actually meeting your sleep duration goal.</p>
<p>That starts with choosing not only when you would like to wake up in the morning,</p>
<p>but also when you&rsquo;d like to go to bed.</p>
<p>For most of us, setting a goal is easy.</p>
<p>But getting to bed on time, that&rsquo;s the hard part.</p>
<p>Experts say that establishing a bedtime routine</p>
<p>helps the body transition from wakefulness to sleep.</p>
<p>So we are offering Wind Down.</p>
<p>It can help you get to bed on time by minimizing distractions</p>
<p>and creating a personalized routine.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at how this works.</p>
<p>In the evening, ahead of your bedtime,</p>
<p>your phone can display the Wind Down screen</p>
<p>to help you transition mentally before you go to bed.</p>
<p>It creates a calm lock screen experience and turns on Do Not Disturb for you.</p>
<p>You can also set up shortcuts</p>
<p>for simple things you may like to do to help you prepare for bed.</p>
<p>These might include using your favorite meditation app</p>
<p>or playing relaxing music.</p>
<p>Once it&rsquo;s time for bed,</p>
<p>your screen will dim and your watch will go into Sleep Mode,</p>
<p>which looks like this.</p>
<p>The screen will be off during time in bed so it won&rsquo;t bother you,</p>
<p>and a tap displays this simple face.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s time to wake up,</p>
<p>you have a selection of gentle and effective alarm sounds,</p>
<p>or a silent Taptic-only wake-up alarm so you don&rsquo;t disturb your partner.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;re up, you&rsquo;ll see a friendly greeting easing you into the day.</p>
<p>It also shows your battery level</p>
<p>so you can remember to charge in the morning.</p>
<p>Apple Watch tracks your sleep</p>
<p>using a machine-learning model that senses your motion</p>
<p>and even interprets the micro-movements</p>
<p>caused by the rise and fall of your breath,</p>
<p>providing signals for when you&rsquo;re awake and when you&rsquo;re asleep.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an updated Sleep section in the Health app,</p>
<p>including a view of your trends over time.</p>
<p>Sleep Schedules, Wind Down, and Sleep Mode</p>
<p>are also available on iPhone, without a watch, in iOS 14.</p>
<p>We know you&rsquo;ll enjoy using your watch throughout the day</p>
<p>and now throughout the night.</p>
<p>Thanks, Vera.</p>
<p>In addition to sleep keeping you healthy,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another preventative-care item that&rsquo;s so important, particularly now:</p>
<p>handwashing.</p>
<p>In watchOS 7,</p>
<p>Apple Watch is the first watch to deliver automatic detection</p>
<p>when you start washing your hands and sensing of how long you actually wash.</p>
<p>Our approach here is using machine-learning models</p>
<p>to determine motion which appears to be handwashing</p>
<p>and then use audio to confirm the sound of running water</p>
<p>or squishing soap on your hands.</p>
<p>During this, you&rsquo;ll get a little coaching to do a good job.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see a countdown, along with haptics and sounds,</p>
<p>to make sure you wash as long as you&rsquo;re supposed to.</p>
<p>If you pause early, there&rsquo;s a polite note to keep washing.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re done, you&rsquo;ll see, hear and feel it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just some of what&rsquo;s coming this year in watchOS 7,</p>
<p>including discovering and sharing faces, new workout types,</p>
<p>sleep and handwashing detection,</p>
<p>and other new capabilities like Siri language translation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s Apple Watch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for you to join Craig again</p>
<p>to talk about something that&rsquo;s important to all of us.</p>
<p>Here we go!</p>
<p>[&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Getting Tired&rdquo; by Jacknife Lee playing]</p>
<p>[song ends]</p>
<p>At Apple, we believe privacy is a fundamental human right.</p>
<p>So we build it into our products from the beginning of the design process.</p>
<p>Privacy matters now more than ever.</p>
<p>And because our devices contain our most sensitive information,</p>
<p>all of our product work is grounded in a set of privacy principles.</p>
<p>First, data minimization.</p>
<p>We use innovative technologies and techniques</p>
<p>to minimize the personal data we or anyone else can access.</p>
<p>Second, on-device intelligence.</p>
<p>We avoid data collection</p>
<p>by processing as much of your information on your device as we can</p>
<p>rather than sending it to a server.</p>
<p>Third, security.</p>
<p>Security protections are foundational to everything we do in privacy.</p>
<p>And finally, transparency and control.</p>
<p>It helps you better understand the data being collected</p>
<p>so that you can make your own choices about how that data is used.</p>
<p>These principles come together across our products,</p>
<p>in our hardware, our software and our services.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, they result in great privacy and great ease of use.</p>
<p>A powerful example of this is Sign in with Apple,</p>
<p>which is designed for simplicity, security and privacy.</p>
<p>And since we launched it last year,</p>
<p>users have created over 200 million accounts</p>
<p>across a wide variety of apps and websites.</p>
<p>And developers are seeing great usage when they adopt it.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p>Kayak has integrated Sign in with Apple</p>
<p>and found that their users are now two times more likely to use it</p>
<p>than any other sign-in provider.</p>
<p>Now, one thing we hear a lot with Sign in with Apple</p>
<p>is that people wish they could convert their existing accounts to use it.</p>
<p>So this year we&rsquo;re going to enable developers to let you do just that.</p>
<p>When you upgrade, you get the ease of use</p>
<p>and built-in security of Sign in with Apple</p>
<p>while keeping the account that you already have.</p>
<p>This is another big year of privacy improvements in our products.</p>
<p>And to tell you more, here&rsquo;s Katie Skinner and Erik Neuenschwander.</p>
<p>Thanks, Craig.</p>
<p>First let&rsquo;s talk about location.</p>
<p>This year we&rsquo;re continuing to give you even more control.</p>
<p>In addition to the option of sharing your precise location,</p>
<p>you will have the option to only share your approximate location with apps.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also making changes for mic and camera</p>
<p>so you always know when you&rsquo;re recording.</p>
<p>In addition to requiring your permission,</p>
<p>this year we&rsquo;re adding more visibility for current or recent mic or camera use.</p>
<p>So if an app uses either one, we&rsquo;ll indicate that in the status bar.</p>
<p>[Katie] Next, let&rsquo;s talk about tracking.</p>
<p>Safari&rsquo;s Intelligent Tracking Prevention has been really successful on the web.</p>
<p>And this year, we wanted to help you with tracking in apps.</p>
<p>We believe tracking should always be transparent and under your control.</p>
<p>So moving forward,</p>
<p>App Store policy will require apps to ask before tracking you</p>
<p>across apps and websites owned by other companies.</p>
<p>[Erik] Last, let&rsquo;s talk about app privacy.</p>
<p>Today we require that apps have a privacy policy.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great to even more quickly and easily see</p>
<p>a summary of an app&rsquo;s privacy practices before you download it?</p>
<p>Now, where have we seen something like that before?</p>
<p>For food, you have nutrition labels.</p>
<p>You can see if it&rsquo;s packed with protein or loaded with sugar, or maybe both,</p>
<p>all before you buy it.</p>
<p>So we thought it would be great to have something similar for apps.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to require each developer to self-report their practices.</p>
<p>[Katie] We&rsquo;ll show you what they tell us.</p>
<p>You can see if the developer is collecting a little bit of data on you</p>
<p>or a lot of data,</p>
<p>or if they&rsquo;re sharing data with other companies to track you,</p>
<p>and much more.</p>
<p>[Erik] We&rsquo;re going to put this information</p>
<p>on product pages in the App Store.</p>
<p>So for each app, you can see highlights of their privacy information</p>
<p>before you download it.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to include this in all of our App Stores.</p>
<p>Back over to you, Craig.</p>
<p>Thanks, Katie and Erik.</p>
<p>These are some of the ways we&rsquo;re strengthening the privacy of our platforms</p>
<p>and bringing new features to give users even more control.</p>
<p>And one of the places where privacy matters most is your home.</p>
<p>Like most of you,</p>
<p>in the past few months I&rsquo;ve spent more time at home than I ever imagined.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more clear than ever just how important it is</p>
<p>to live in a home where the technology just works.</p>
<p>That brings us to some great new features we&rsquo;re bringing to the home this year.</p>
<p>All of these features share a few key attributes.</p>
<p>First, anything we develop for the home should be easy,</p>
<p>from initial setup to everyday use,</p>
<p>just like how a tap of your iPhone can automatically configure an Apple TV.</p>
<p>Second, home products should never compromise your privacy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why your Siri requests use a random identifier, not your Apple ID.</p>
<p>And finally, your devices should all work better together,</p>
<p>like how AirPlay lets you share from your iPhone straight to the TV.</p>
<p>And when things are easy, private and work together seamlessly,</p>
<p>your home is more enjoyable,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re watching TV, listening to music</p>
<p>or getting the most out of your smart devices.</p>
<p>To tell you more about what we have in store for the home,</p>
<p>let me pass it to Yah Cason.</p>
<p>Thanks, Craig.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start by talking about the smart home.</p>
<p>With HomeKit, we&rsquo;ve given developers a robust framework</p>
<p>to create smart home accessories that are remarkably easy to set up</p>
<p>all while being end-to-end encrypted to your Apple devices.</p>
<p>Already there&rsquo;s a rich ecosystem of devices available.</p>
<p>But we want to make it even easier to build products</p>
<p>that work across more homes.</p>
<p>So we formed an alliance</p>
<p>and partnered with Amazon, Google and other industry leaders</p>
<p>to define a new interoperability standard for the smart home.</p>
<p>We open-sourced HomeKit</p>
<p>to ensure its ease of use and privacy are core to this effort.</p>
<p>And any accessory using HomeKit or this new standard</p>
<p>will work incredibly well across all your Apple devices.</p>
<p>And you control it all in the Home app,</p>
<p>the most secure way to manage your smart home.</p>
<p>Adding new devices to your home has never been easier.</p>
<p>Simply tap or scan to set up an accessory.</p>
<p>And in iOS 14, after you add an accessory,</p>
<p>the Home app will now suggest useful automations</p>
<p>so you can immediately put your new device to work for you.</p>
<p>Automations are rules that set your home to autopilot,</p>
<p>like automatically turning on your porch lights when motion is detected</p>
<p>or having the garage door open as you arrive home.</p>
<p>And now when you open the Home app,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see a new visual status right up top</p>
<p>that prioritizes the accessories which most need your attention.</p>
<p>You can easily see if you&rsquo;ve left a door unlocked or the lights on</p>
<p>and quickly control them.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a closer look</p>
<p>at one of the most popular categories of HomeKit accessories:</p>
<p>Lights.</p>
<p>Millions of us have already added smart bulbs to our homes,</p>
<p>many of which can change color on demand.</p>
<p>In iOS 14,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re introducing a feature to help you get the most out of those bulbs:</p>
<p>Adaptive lighting.</p>
<p>Adaptive lighting automatically adjusts the color temperature of your lights</p>
<p>throughout the day.</p>
<p>Turn it on to ease into the morning with warm colors,</p>
<p>stay focused and alert midday with cooler ones,</p>
<p>and wind down at night by reducing blue light.</p>
<p>Adaptive lighting ensures you get the right color at the right time.</p>
<p>Another popular smart home category is cameras.</p>
<p>With HomeKit Secure Video your cameras are completely private.</p>
<p>And in iOS 14, we&rsquo;re making your cameras work even harder for you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be able to define Activity Zones that focus on the most important areas.</p>
<p>This is great if you face a busy sidewalk</p>
<p>and only want to be alerted when people actually walk up to your front door.</p>
<p>Another powerful feature we&rsquo;re bringing to cameras is face recognition.</p>
<p>HomeKit cameras and video doorbells will now provide even richer notifications,</p>
<p>telling you who&rsquo;s there by leveraging the friends and family</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve already tagged in your Photos app.</p>
<p>And face recognition extends to HomePod, announcing who&rsquo;s at the door.</p>
<p>And with Apple TV, you&rsquo;ll get a live view whenever someone rings the bell.</p>
<p>In fact, all your HomeKit-enabled cameras will be directly integrated with tvOS 14</p>
<p>so you can quickly bring them up in the new home view in Control Center.</p>
<p>Or just ask Siri to pull up any camera at any time.</p>
<p>You can even take any camera full-screen,</p>
<p>giving you a great view of what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And we have even more coming to tvOS 14.</p>
<p>Now let me pass it to Cindy Lin to tell you about it.</p>
<p>Thanks, Yah.</p>
<p>Apple TV is my favorite way to unwind and enjoy entertainment with the family.</p>
<p>With 4K, HDR,</p>
<p>Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos,</p>
<p>you get a theater-like experience right in your living room,</p>
<p>making all your movies and shows look and sound amazing.</p>
<p>But Apple TV goes beyond video.</p>
<p>You can access the entire Apple Music collection</p>
<p>and even sing along with timed lyrics.</p>
<p>You can play an incredible selection of games,</p>
<p>including all the games in Apple Arcade.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re making gaming on Apple TV even more personal</p>
<p>by expanding multiuser support.</p>
<p>Now you can instantly resume your games exactly where you left off.</p>
<p>Just open Control Center to switch between users,</p>
<p>and you can now see your game progress, achievements and friends.</p>
<p>And for even more fun, we&rsquo;re adding support</p>
<p>for Xbox Elite 2 and Xbox Adaptive Controllers.</p>
<p>Apple TV also helps you keep active at home</p>
<p>with a great selection of fitness apps.</p>
<p>And with tvOS 14,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna make your workouts, and everything you do on Apple TV,</p>
<p>even more productive by extending Picture in Picture</p>
<p>across the entire Apple TV experience.</p>
<p>So you can keep up with the news or not miss a second of the big game.</p>
<p>You can even have an AirPlay session show up in a Picture in Picture window.</p>
<p>And AirPlay is getting even better.</p>
<p>Now the whole family can share their stunning videos captured on iPhone</p>
<p>in their full 4K resolution.</p>
<p>With videos, music, games and more,</p>
<p>Apple TV truly offers something for everyone.</p>
<p>Of course, nothing compares to being captivated by a good story.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve built a service for just that: Apple TV+.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already created an incredible lineup of Apple Originals.</p>
<p>And you can watch them all in the Apple TV app,</p>
<p>which is available on your favorite Apple devices,</p>
<p>on all major streaming boxes</p>
<p>and many popular smart TVs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already reaching over a billion screens.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s coming to Sony and Vizio smart TVs later this summer.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re really excited to tell you about a new Apple TV+ Original</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re working on.</p>
<p>Almost 70 years ago,</p>
<p>Isaac Asimov introduced the world to a series of epic novels</p>
<p>that spanned hundreds of worlds and thousands of years.</p>
<p>Many consider it to be the best science-fiction series of all time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to share a sneak peek with you now.</p>
<p>This is Foundation.</p>
<p>[dramatic music playing]</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to arrest me tomorrow.</p>
<p>And you. It&rsquo;s almost a certainty.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re familiar with my work, psychohistory?</p>
<p>Yes, in theory. But I don&rsquo;t know what it has to do with&ndash;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a theory.</p>
<p>[Salvor] They&rsquo;re worried you can predict the future.</p>
<p>[whirring]</p>
<p>[Hari] They&rsquo;re worried people believe I can.</p>
<p>[whirring]</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t like the future I predict.</p>
<p>The empire will fall.</p>
<p>Order will vanish.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s massive events rushing to meet us.</p>
<p>[Salvor] Only we can shorten the darkness.</p>
<p>[music fades]</p>
<p>Wow. I&rsquo;m super excited to watch Foundation when it comes to Apple TV+ next year.</p>
<p>With Apple TV, your home has never been more entertaining.</p>
<p>And with adaptive lighting, face recognition for cameras</p>
<p>and these other great features,</p>
<p>your time at home has never been more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Now let me hand it back to Craig.</p>
<p>Welcome back.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about some big changes coming to macOS.</p>
<p>Since its introduction,</p>
<p>macOS has revolutionized the experience of using a computer</p>
<p>by combining incredible power with incredible ease of use.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s loved by all different types of users,</p>
<p>from families and students</p>
<p>to creative pros,</p>
<p>businesspeople and, of course, software developers.</p>
<p>And this year, we&rsquo;re taking the macOS experience you love</p>
<p>even further.</p>
<p>But what should we call it?</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;re a student of macOS, you know this question</p>
<p>can only be answered by Apple&rsquo;s legendary crack marketing team.</p>
<p>Their drug-fueled, minibus-driven vision quests</p>
<p>have yielded some great names</p>
<p>and, sadly, spawned a host of imitators.</p>
<p>The truth is, we can&rsquo;t responsibly continue</p>
<p>to inadvertently lead our competition to copy these methods</p>
<p>when they clearly can&rsquo;t handle the trip.</p>
<p>So this year, we&rsquo;re leaving our process shrouded in mystery</p>
<p>and taking you straight to the glorious destination.</p>
<p>Our next release of macOS is macOS Big Sur.</p>
<p>macOS Big Sur introduces an entirely new design</p>
<p>and major updates to some of the most essential apps on the platform.</p>
<p>And just like its name,</p>
<p>Big Sur brings you unmatched levels of power and beauty.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with design,</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re making the biggest change since the introduction of Mac OS X.</p>
<p>To tell you more about the philosophy and incredible craftsmanship</p>
<p>behind the new design,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a short video with Alan Dye.</p>
<p>[piano playing]</p>
<p>At Apple, design has always been about great ideas.</p>
<p>Those ideas then are developed with this obsessive dedication to detail.</p>
<p>If we care enough about all the details that make up a product,</p>
<p>then in the end we will have designed an experience</p>
<p>that really feels like there&rsquo;s no other way it could be.</p>
<p>And the best example of this is macOS Big Sur.</p>
<p>Our goal was to bring even more clarity to the design of the software</p>
<p>while retaining the Mac&rsquo;s powerful capability and ease of use.</p>
<p>We started with the simplest of elements,</p>
<p>from the shape of a corner radius to refinements in buttons and controls.</p>
<p>And we brought our unified language of symbols to the Mac,</p>
<p>making them more consistent and easier to recognize.</p>
<p>Depth, shading and translucency</p>
<p>are used to create hierarchy.</p>
<p>These new materials are rich, and they&rsquo;re vibrant.</p>
<p>They bridge light and dark.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve reduced visual complexity to keep the focus on users&rsquo; content.</p>
<p>Buttons and controls appear when you need them,</p>
<p>and they recede when you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a new way to access system-level controls</p>
<p>and a unified space for notifications and widgets.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also created a new suite of sounds.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re familiar to the Mac, but remastered and more refined.</p>
<p>[pulses]</p>
<p>[alert notifications chiming]</p>
<p>We wanted consistency throughout the ecosystem,</p>
<p>so users can move fluidly between their Apple devices.</p>
<p>But we also love that Mac icons have a deep history</p>
<p>and a distinct look and feel.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve retained many of the highly crafted details</p>
<p>and the playful elements that make Mac icons unique.</p>
<p>This OS reflects an important history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s familiar, but it&rsquo;s also entirely new in every detail.</p>
<p>We love the Mac.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the tool we use to make all the products that we put out into the world.</p>
<p>And macOS Big Sur is where it starts.</p>
<p>[Craig] So that&rsquo;s the thinking behind our new design.</p>
<p>Now let me show it to you in action with a demo.</p>
<p>As Alan said,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve refined some of the most iconic elements of the Mac experience.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the Dock.</p>
<p>It has an elegant new design that floats along the bottom of your desktop.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll notice that we&rsquo;ve created gorgeous new app icons</p>
<p>for all of your favorite apps.</p>
<p>Speaking of apps, let&rsquo;s take a look at the Finder.</p>
<p>You notice it has a gorgeous new top-to-bottom design for the sidebar,</p>
<p>and it has a compact, space-efficient toolbar.</p>
<p>Makes it really easy to get to all of your controls.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s take a look at Mail.</p>
<p>You can see that Mail has all-new glyphs in the sidebar,</p>
<p>and you may have noticed that we&rsquo;ve brought color back as well.</p>
<p>Now, each app uses its own key color.</p>
<p>That same color is used for the elegant new rounded row selection style</p>
<p>here in the message list.</p>
<p>Now, the toolbar makes it really easy to get to all your controls.</p>
<p>Check out how the search bar expands as I click on it.</p>
<p>And, of course, other operations like filtering,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just a click away.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s take a look at Photos.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just stunning.</p>
<p>You can get to all your albums and media types from the sidebar,</p>
<p>and the photo grid is backed by Metal,</p>
<p>so animations are super smooth</p>
<p>whether I&rsquo;m scrolling, transitioning</p>
<p>or zooming all the way in or all the way out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ve refreshed the design for all the apps on the system,</p>
<p>from apps like Calendar and Notes</p>
<p>to Podcasts and Music, with its new Listen Now pane.</p>
<p>And an all-new version of iWork that features a simplified toolbar.</p>
<p>You may have noticed we&rsquo;ve also updated the menu bar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now translucent and elegantly takes on the color of your desktop picture.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve updated the layout of menus as well.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve given all the items just a little bit more room to breathe.</p>
<p>Now, on the Mac, we love our ability to get directly at controls,</p>
<p>like Wi-Fi or Sound.</p>
<p>And you can see that we&rsquo;ve reworked these to be even more useful.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve gone even further this year</p>
<p>by giving you one place to get at all your controls.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve brought Control Center to the Mac.</p>
<p>All of my controls are here, and it&rsquo;s really easy to make adjustments.</p>
<p>For instance, I can change display brightness here</p>
<p>or I can click to dive in for more,</p>
<p>like turning on Dark Mode or activating Night Shift.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really cool is that I can customize the menu bar</p>
<p>with any of these controls.</p>
<p>So, say I want one-click access to Do Not Disturb.</p>
<p>I can just click and drag it right into my menu bar</p>
<p>and customize just like that.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ve also reinvented Notification Center.</p>
<p>You can access it by clicking on the time in the upper right.</p>
<p>And as you see, we now have a single view</p>
<p>that brings your notifications and widgets together all in one place.</p>
<p>And we now group related notifications together.</p>
<p>You can easily expand them to take a closer look</p>
<p>or clear them all out in one step.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re bringing our redesigned widgets to the Mac.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really beautiful.</p>
<p>And you have all-new ways to customize them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna click &ldquo;Edit Widgets&rdquo; down here at the bottom.</p>
<p>And you can see I have a gallery of all my widgets,</p>
<p>and they come in a variety of sizes.</p>
<p>I can select between them just like this.</p>
<p>And developers can bring their own widgets as well,</p>
<p>like this one here from Day One.</p>
<p>Now adding widgets is easy.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start by adding, say, the World Clock.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll add Notes in.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;d be kind of cool to add my Reminders list as well.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a look at Widgets, Notification Center</p>
<p>and our all-new design in Big Sur.</p>
<p>Next, there are exciting updates for some of the most-used apps on the Mac.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s talk about Messages.</p>
<p>Messages on the Mac is designed to work seamlessly with all of your devices,</p>
<p>so your SMS and iMessage conversations are in sync</p>
<p>no matter what device you&rsquo;re using.</p>
<p>Now this year we&rsquo;re taking Messages to the next level</p>
<p>with a ton of great new features.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re introducing powerful search to help you find what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>We have a redesigned photo picker to make sharing photos and videos easier.</p>
<p>And Memoji. You can now create and edit your Memoji right on your Mac.</p>
<p>And Memoji stickers bring personality to messages,</p>
<p>giving you fun ways to express yourself in all of your conversations.</p>
<p>Messages effects helps you celebrate special moments</p>
<p>and get your point across.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re also getting pinned conversations</p>
<p>that are synced across devices so you can always get to them,</p>
<p>along with new Groups enhancements.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s coming to Messages on Mac:</p>
<p>powerful tools to manage your conversations</p>
<p>and new ways to express yourself.</p>
<p>Next up, Maps.</p>
<p>Apple Maps is the best way to explore and navigate the world,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re planning a trip on the Mac</p>
<p>or using turn-by-turn directions on your iPhone.</p>
<p>Today I&rsquo;m excited to announce an all-new version of Maps for the Mac.</p>
<p>To start, Maps features a stunning new design</p>
<p>that makes it easy to find your way around using Apple&rsquo;s detailed new map.</p>
<p>And for the first time on the Mac,</p>
<p>Favorites like home, work or that great coffee shop on the corner</p>
<p>are now just a click away.</p>
<p>You can now create your own Guides of all the places you want to visit</p>
<p>right on your Mac.</p>
<p>And before leaving for the airport,</p>
<p>you can check where your gate is located with indoor maps</p>
<p>or explore your destination city with Look Around,</p>
<p>which is incredible on the big screen.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve even brought other useful features to the Mac,</p>
<p>like the ability to see the progress of friends</p>
<p>who have shared their ETA with you.</p>
<p>And the Mac gets all the other new Maps features</p>
<p>we just introduced in iOS 14.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just a taste of what&rsquo;s coming in the all-new Apple Maps on the Mac.</p>
<p>Next let&rsquo;s talk about Mac Catalyst.</p>
<p>Catalyst gives developers a big head start</p>
<p>in creating a Mac app from an iPad app.</p>
<p>Take, for instance, our recent release of Swift Playgrounds for Mac.</p>
<p>Catalyst gave us a big head start creating the app,</p>
<p>and we were able to spend our development time</p>
<p>crafting a great Mac experience.</p>
<p>Today we have some improvements to Mac Catalyst I&rsquo;d like to share.</p>
<p>This year, developers will be able to optimize their apps</p>
<p>to fully utilize the native resolution of the Mac screen,</p>
<p>providing total control of every pixel.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also given developers new capabilities,</p>
<p>including powerful new menu and keyboard APIs</p>
<p>and updated controls like checkboxes and date pickers.</p>
<p>They look great with the new design of macOS.</p>
<p>In fact, we used Catalyst with the new version of Maps.</p>
<p>And just as you&rsquo;d expect,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a full-fledged Mac app that runs natively</p>
<p>and is designed in a way that&rsquo;s true to the Mac.</p>
<p>So you get multiple resizable windows, keyboard shortcuts</p>
<p>and everything else you&rsquo;d expect from a native Mac app.</p>
<p>And we did the same thing for Messages.</p>
<p>Maps and Messages join the great set of apps from Apple</p>
<p>that already use the Mac Catalyst technology.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a growing list of third-party Catalyst apps available</p>
<p>on the Mac App Store.</p>
<p>Next&hellip; Safari.</p>
<p>Our users love Safari</p>
<p>for its speedy performance, power efficiency</p>
<p>and state-of-the-art privacy protections.</p>
<p>And it delivers all of that</p>
<p>while making it easy to get to your bookmarks, tabs and browsing history</p>
<p>across all of your devices.</p>
<p>This year, we&rsquo;re building on Safari&rsquo;s amazing performance,</p>
<p>elegant design and pioneering privacy protections</p>
<p>to deliver the biggest update to Safari since it was first introduced.</p>
<p>As you know, Safari has long been the world&rsquo;s fastest desktop browser.</p>
<p>This year, Safari&rsquo;s performance running JavaScript is better than ever</p>
<p>and continues to significantly outpace all other major browsers.</p>
<p>And now, when it comes to page loading, we&rsquo;re even faster there too.</p>
<p>In fact, when loading frequently visited websites,</p>
<p>Safari is now on average more than 50% faster than Chrome.</p>
<p>And Safari delivers this amazing performance</p>
<p>while continuing to deliver industry-leading battery life.</p>
<p>And of course, Safari is continuing to build</p>
<p>on its pioneering track record of protecting user privacy.</p>
<p>Safari was the first browser to introduce private browsing, cookie blocking,</p>
<p>and most recently, Intelligent Tracking Prevention.</p>
<p>This year, we want to give our users even more visibility</p>
<p>into how each site they visit tries to track them</p>
<p>and the ways that Safari protects them.</p>
<p>So now users can click on the Privacy Report button in the toolbar</p>
<p>when they visit a site</p>
<p>to better understand how that site is treating their privacy.</p>
<p>In addition to monitoring unwanted tracking,</p>
<p>Safari now also securely monitors your saved passwords</p>
<p>to ensure that they haven&rsquo;t been compromised in a data breach.</p>
<p>And this is also a big year for extensions in Safari.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re adding support for the WebExtensions API</p>
<p>so developers can easily bring over extensions</p>
<p>that they built for other browsers.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re building an all-new category in the Mac App Store</p>
<p>to showcase Safari extensions so users can easily find them.</p>
<p>Now extensions are very powerful</p>
<p>but can introduce privacy challenges.</p>
<p>In other browsers, extensions can access every page you visit,</p>
<p>every tab you open,</p>
<p>even everything you type.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re doing even more here.</p>
<p>In Safari, you choose which sites each extension can work with,</p>
<p>and you can even give them access just for the day,</p>
<p>just for the website or all the time.</p>
<p>But improved performance,</p>
<p>power efficiency and privacy protections are only the start.</p>
<p>We have a whole slew of new features this year.</p>
<p>From a customizable start page</p>
<p>to redesigned tabs that are more elegant and powerful,</p>
<p>and native translation capabilities built right into Safari.</p>
<p>To tell you more, I&rsquo;ll hand it off to Beth Dakin.</p>
<p>Thanks, Craig.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so excited to give you a tour of the brand-new Safari.</p>
<p>When you open Safari, right away you&rsquo;ll notice the new look.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clean and fresh.</p>
<p>I want to show you one of my favorite new features:</p>
<p>the customizable start page.</p>
<p>I love it because I can make it my own.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to get to the customization controls</p>
<p>here in the bottom corner.</p>
<p>We think a lot of people are gonna want to set a background image,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a beautiful gallery of curated wallpapers to choose from.</p>
<p>You can use one of your own photos, too, and I know I want a photo of my son.</p>
<p>I have a few really cute ones here in the downloads.</p>
<p>I can just drag and drop to set it.</p>
<p>That is so perfect.</p>
<p>You can add new sections to the start page too.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s add iCloud Tabs and Reading List.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look.</p>
<p>There. This is perfect.</p>
<p>I use Reading List all the time, and now it&rsquo;s so easy to get to.</p>
<p>Another way that you can dial in Safari to suit your specific needs</p>
<p>is with extensions.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait for you developers to bring your web extensions to Safari.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone ahead and downloaded a few web extensions to take a peek.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go here to the Safari preferences to enable them.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll enable Power Thesaurus and Recipe Filter.</p>
<p>So each of the extensions that I just enabled</p>
<p>now has its own button here in the toolbar.</p>
<p>Let me show you Recipe Filter. I love this one.</p>
<p>So this extension will search the web page for a recipe,</p>
<p>and if it finds one, it will pop it up in a little card.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a great accelerator for me when I&rsquo;m building a grocery list.</p>
<p>So the extension hasn&rsquo;t done anything yet because I haven&rsquo;t granted permission.</p>
<p>So let me click on the toolbar button,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to allow this extension for one day.</p>
<p>And when I click here, it&rsquo;ll do its thing.</p>
<p>So here we go. And there it is. So useful.</p>
<p>Okay, so I have my personality</p>
<p>pretty thoroughly stamped over Safari at this point.</p>
<p>And you know, I use Safari for a lot of personal things,</p>
<p>and Apple makes sure my private life stays private.</p>
<p>Privacy is essential to everything we do at Apple, and it&rsquo;s critical on the web.</p>
<p>And now you can see what Safari is doing to protect you.</p>
<p>If I click on the Intelligent Tracking Prevention button,</p>
<p>I can see the number of known trackers</p>
<p>that Safari protected me from on this web page.</p>
<p>I can click here</p>
<p>to see a list of the known trackers right here in this popover.</p>
<p>And the full privacy report is just one click away.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we have for privacy in the new Safari.</p>
<p>Next I&rsquo;d like to talk about tabs.</p>
<p>If you love tabs, you&rsquo;re going to love the new Safari.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier and more efficient than ever to work with lots of tabs.</p>
<p>So I have another window here,</p>
<p>and right away you&rsquo;ll notice that there are icons and tabs,</p>
<p>which makes it so easy to spot what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>And if I open more tabs, then you&rsquo;ll see more of them at once</p>
<p>because the tabs get smaller and use the space more efficiently.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a little hard to find what you&rsquo;re looking for with this many tabs,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s no problem.</p>
<p>You can just hover over tabs and see a nice preview of the page.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready to clean up now, and that&rsquo;s easy too.</p>
<p>I can just bring up the context menu here</p>
<p>and close all tabs to the right. Just like that.</p>
<p>We are so excited that the new Safari has built-in translation.</p>
<p>Let me show you.</p>
<p>So here on this website, on El Mundo,</p>
<p>Safari has detected that this is not in my primary language,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s added the translation icon to the smart search field.</p>
<p>I can click here, and let&rsquo;s translate this page to English.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll happen inline.</p>
<p>And as more content is added,</p>
<p>that gets translated dynamically too.</p>
<p>Those are some highlights, but there is so much more to the new Safari.</p>
<p>Back to you, Craig.</p>
<p>Thanks, Beth.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s Safari.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge release, with new ways to customize,</p>
<p>big improvements to your browsing experience</p>
<p>like tabs and translation,</p>
<p>and even stronger privacy protection</p>
<p>to keep your browsing your business.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s macOS Big Sur,</p>
<p>the biggest update to design since the original introduction of Mac OS X,</p>
<p>significant updates to Messages and Maps</p>
<p>and the biggest update to Safari ever.</p>
<p>But these changes are only the beginning.</p>
<p>For years now, down deep, below the surface,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been working on something truly profound.</p>
<p>To tell you more, I&rsquo;ll hand it back to Tim.</p>
<p>Thanks, Craig.</p>
<p>Big Sur is going to be a great release of macOS.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s only part of the story,</p>
<p>because today is going to be a truly historic day for the Mac.</p>
<p>Today we&rsquo;re going to tell you about some really big changes,</p>
<p>how we&rsquo;re going to take the Mac to a whole new level.</p>
<p>From the very beginning,</p>
<p>the Mac redefined the entire computer industry.</p>
<p>The Mac has always been about innovation and boldly pushing things forward,</p>
<p>embracing big changes to stay at the forefront of personal computing.</p>
<p>The Mac has had three major transitions in its history.</p>
<p>The move to PowerPC,</p>
<p>the transition to Mac OS X</p>
<p>and the move to Intel.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s time for a huge leap forward for the Mac,</p>
<p>because today is the day we&rsquo;re announcing that the Mac is transitioning&hellip;</p>
<p>to our own Apple Silicon.</p>
<p>When we make bold changes, it&rsquo;s for one simple yet powerful reason:</p>
<p>so we can make much better products.</p>
<p>When we look ahead, we envision some amazing new products,</p>
<p>and transitioning to our own custom silicon</p>
<p>is what will enable us to bring them to life.</p>
<p>At Apple,</p>
<p>integrating hardware and software is fundamental to everything we do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes our products so great.</p>
<p>And silicon is at the heart of our hardware.</p>
<p>So having a world-class silicon design team</p>
<p>is a game changer.</p>
<p>To tell you more about Apple Silicon</p>
<p>and how it will take Mac to the next level,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to send you over to Johny Srouji</p>
<p>at one of our labs in an undisclosed location.</p>
<p>[&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Getting Tired&rdquo; by Jacknife Lee playing]</p>
<p>[song ends]</p>
<p>Welcome to our lab.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been building and refining our Apple Silicon for over a decade.</p>
<p>The result is a scalable architecture</p>
<p>that is custom-designed for Apple products,</p>
<p>and it leads the industry in features and performance per watt.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to tell you how we got here</p>
<p>and what it means for the Mac moving forward.</p>
<p>It all started with the iPhone.</p>
<p>The iPhone demanded performance and capabilities</p>
<p>that were seen as impossible in a device that small.</p>
<p>This is where we developed our relentless focus on performance per watt.</p>
<p>Generation after generation, we pushed the boundaries of technology,</p>
<p>which enabled us to improve performance and energy efficiency,</p>
<p>while building advanced and industry-leading features.</p>
<p>Our team delivered ten generations of increasingly complex and rich designs,</p>
<p>always improving performance.</p>
<p>In fact, CPU performance in the iPhone</p>
<p>has improved by over a hundred times,</p>
<p>keeping the iPhone&rsquo;s performance ahead of every other phone in the industry.</p>
<p>Another opportunity for the team was the iPad.</p>
<p>While iPhone chips could drive our mainstream iPads,</p>
<p>we wanted to push the iPad even further.</p>
<p>It began with the iPad&rsquo;s Retina display,</p>
<p>which demanded a custom chip.</p>
<p>So the team scaled our architecture</p>
<p>and designed the most-optimized</p>
<p>and highest-performance chip possible for the iPad.</p>
<p>Starting with the A5X,</p>
<p>we built a line of SoCs specifically designed for the iPad.</p>
<p>We doubled the iPhone&rsquo;s graphics performance through a larger GPU</p>
<p>and a wider memory subsystem.</p>
<p>This put the iPad in a class by itself.</p>
<p>Compared to the very first iPad, the latest iPad Pro delivers</p>
<p>over 1,000 times faster graphics performance</p>
<p>in just ten years.</p>
<p>This is part of the reason why the iPad Pro is faster</p>
<p>than the vast majority of PC laptops.</p>
<p>And this foreshadows how well our architecture will scale into the Mac.</p>
<p>Another place where we applied our focus was the Watch.</p>
<p>We scaled our SoC architecture to optimize performance</p>
<p>for the device&rsquo;s unique low-power requirements,</p>
<p>and we built a chip perfectly suited for Apple Watch.</p>
<p>Our SoCs enable each of these products with unique features</p>
<p>and industry-leading performance per watt,</p>
<p>and it makes each of them best in class.</p>
<p>And we do this at an enormous scale.</p>
<p>In fact, adding all of the processors across these three products,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve shipped over two billion in just ten years.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve designed and shipped billions of additional chips</p>
<p>that work together with our SoCs</p>
<p>to enable our amazing products.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re bringing all of that expertise</p>
<p>and that same focused and disciplined approach</p>
<p>to the Mac.</p>
<p>The first thing this will do is give the Mac a whole new level of performance.</p>
<p>Now, when we talk about performance, we have to talk about power,</p>
<p>because all systems built today are constrained by power consumption,</p>
<p>thermals, or both.</p>
<p>Among today&rsquo;s consumer systems,</p>
<p>desktops deliver the highest performance</p>
<p>but consume the most power.</p>
<p>Notebooks trade off performance for lower power,</p>
<p>making them portable.</p>
<p>As you can see, normally to get more performance</p>
<p>you have to consume more power.</p>
<p>When you take a closer look at this chart,</p>
<p>you realize you want to operate in the upper-left corner.</p>
<p>You want to deliver the highest performance</p>
<p>at the lowest power consumption.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly where we want to take the Mac.</p>
<p>Building up on our years of experience</p>
<p>designing the world&rsquo;s most energy-efficient chips,</p>
<p>our plan is to give the Mac a much higher level of performance</p>
<p>while at the same time consuming less power.</p>
<p>So, much better performance is reason enough</p>
<p>to transition the Mac to Apple SoCs.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just part of the story.</p>
<p>Our scalable architecture includes many custom technologies</p>
<p>that when integrated with our software</p>
<p>will bring even more innovation to the Mac.</p>
<p>With our advanced power management,</p>
<p>we will maximize performance and battery life</p>
<p>better than ever before.</p>
<p>Our Secure Enclave will bring best-in-class security,</p>
<p>and our high-performance GPU</p>
<p>is going to bring a whole new level of graphics performance to every Mac,</p>
<p>making them even better for Pro Applications</p>
<p>and really great for games.</p>
<p>And combined with our neural engines,</p>
<p>our chips will make the Mac an amazing platform for machine learning.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re bringing many other custom technologies,</p>
<p>such as our video-display and image-processing engines,</p>
<p>that will help make the Mac better than ever before.</p>
<p>So, what does all of this mean for the Mac?</p>
<p>First, we&rsquo;re designing a family of SoCs specifically for the Mac product line.</p>
<p>Second, just like we did with the iPhone, iPad and Watch,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to bring great technologies to the Mac.</p>
<p>This will give the Mac a unique set of features</p>
<p>and incredible performance.</p>
<p>And third, we&rsquo;ll have a common architecture</p>
<p>across all of our product lines,</p>
<p>making it far easier for developers to write and optimize software</p>
<p>for the entire Apple ecosystem.</p>
<p>Ultimately we know that bringing our SoCs to the Mac</p>
<p>will allow us to build much better products,</p>
<p>and the Mac will take another huge leap forward.</p>
<p>Now, a key advantage we have</p>
<p>is the tight integration of our silicon with our software.</p>
<p>To tell you more about how macOS will run on Apple SoCs,</p>
<p>here is my colleague, Craig.</p>
<p>Thanks, Johny.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about the technologies that we&rsquo;ve built into macOS Big Sur</p>
<p>that will make the transition to Apple Silicon smooth and seamless</p>
<p>for both consumers and developers.</p>
<p>These new Mac systems will be incredible,</p>
<p>and users will want their favorite apps</p>
<p>to take full advantage of the capabilities of our custom silicon.</p>
<p>And the best way to do that is with native apps.</p>
<p>So of course when we updated our apps for Big Sur,</p>
<p>we built everything as native for Apple Silicon.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m happy to say we have all of our own Apple apps,</p>
<p>including our most demanding Pro Apps like Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro,</p>
<p>up and running as native now,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll be ready for customers on day one.</p>
<p>So, how did we do this?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re using Xcode, just like all our developers will.</p>
<p>Everything developers need to build apps for these new chips</p>
<p>is built into the new version of Xcode.</p>
<p>To get started, developers just open their app projects and recompile.</p>
<p>The vast majority of developers can get their apps up and running</p>
<p>in just a matter of days.</p>
<p>And to deliver these apps,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve created Universal 2.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a new type of Universal binary</p>
<p>that works on both Intel-based Macs and Macs built on Apple Silicon.</p>
<p>So developers can tap into the native power and performance of our new Macs</p>
<p>and still support Intel-based Macs,</p>
<p>all with a single binary for all of their users.</p>
<p>Some of the biggest Mac developers have already gotten started.</p>
<p>Microsoft is hard at work on Office for the Mac.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve been working with Adobe</p>
<p>on their flagship Creative Cloud,</p>
<p>and many of their apps are already up and running great.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a look at macOS running on Apple Silicon.</p>
<p>So here we are on the desktop that we know and love.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just gonna open up About This Mac.</p>
<p>And what you see here is that we are running on our Apple Development Platform.</p>
<p>This is a system built to support early development</p>
<p>using the same A12Z processor</p>
<p>currently shipping in iPad Pro.</p>
<p>Now, I have a confession to make.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time you&rsquo;ve seen macOS running here.</p>
<p>In fact, this is the same Mac</p>
<p>that Beth and I used to demo all the new Big Sur features earlier.</p>
<p>And as you saw earlier,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve updated all of our Apple apps</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re running great.</p>
<p>Of course, a big part of the Mac experience is third-party apps,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve been working with our friends at Microsoft,</p>
<p>and they already have Office up and running natively on our new Macs.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at Word.</p>
<p>It runs great.</p>
<p>Scrolling is super smooth.</p>
<p>Everything you do is just super responsive.</p>
<p>Next let&rsquo;s check out Excel.</p>
<p>Just as you&rsquo;d expect, complex sheets and elements like this map</p>
<p>all update instantly.</p>
<p>And next let&rsquo;s take a look at PowerPoint.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s using Metal for rendering, and it performs great.</p>
<p>For instance, check out how I can see all the layers of my slide in 3D.</p>
<p>The animation is perfectly fluid.</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;ve also been working closely with our friends at Adobe</p>
<p>to bring Creative Cloud to our new Macs.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Lightroom running native on Apple Silicon.</p>
<p>Navigating large libraries of DNG images is super fast,</p>
<p>and all of Lightroom&rsquo;s editing controls are available right here.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s apply an adjustment to this image.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s much better.</p>
<p>And we can apply that same edit to all of these images in a single step.</p>
<p>Looks great.</p>
<p>Next, let me show you the app I know many of you wanna see:</p>
<p>Photoshop.</p>
<p>Here is a five-gigabyte Photoshop file by photographer Stephen Wilkes.</p>
<p>Now this is a heavy-duty document with lots of layers.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s add one more bird in there.</p>
<p>Not totally comfortable with the level of social distancing, but let&rsquo;s keep going.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s check out how smooth the animation is as I zoom out.</p>
<p>Wow. Beautiful.</p>
<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s turn to one of our most sophisticated apps:</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>Here it is running on Apple Silicon for the first time.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s play back some 4K video.</p>
<p>As you can see, playback is super smooth.</p>
<p>And all your filters are here, and you can apply them in real time.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try some color correction.</p>
<p>And I can even add animated titles and lens flare&hellip;</p>
<p>all during live playback.</p>
<p>And Final Cut takes advantage</p>
<p>of the unique capabilities of the Apple Neural Engine</p>
<p>with a new feature that analyzes video and intelligently crops it</p>
<p>to keep the most important action in the frame.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not all.</p>
<p>Final Cut fully exploits the system&rsquo;s multicore architecture</p>
<p>to let us play back not just one or two, but three streams</p>
<p>of full-resolution 4K ProRes, all on an A12Z processor.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a first look at Universal apps on Apple Silicon.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re really excited to see so much great work on native apps.</p>
<p>These apps even get more amazing when they&rsquo;re built to take advantage of</p>
<p>the Silicon&rsquo;s powerful capabilities.</p>
<p>Like its incredible CPU and graphics performance,</p>
<p>a unified memory architecture and the Neural Engine</p>
<p>which accelerates advanced machine-learning tasks.</p>
<p>The transition to Apple Silicon is also great for developers</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve already optimized their apps for other Apple platforms.</p>
<p>The shared architecture across our products</p>
<p>means that their code will absolutely sing on our new Macs.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s even more to the story.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing some really important things</p>
<p>to make this transition seamless for our users.</p>
<p>Now, while we expect most developers will go native immediately,</p>
<p>we wanna make sure that users can run all of their apps on day one,</p>
<p>even if some apps haven&rsquo;t yet been updated.</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;ve been down this road before.</p>
<p>When we transitioned from PowerPC to Intel processors,</p>
<p>a cornerstone of that transition was Rosetta,</p>
<p>a technology that makes it possible to run PowerPC apps on Intel-based Macs.</p>
<p>macOS Big Sur will include a new version of Rosetta, Rosetta 2.</p>
<p>Rosetta 2 automatically translates your existing Mac apps</p>
<p>so they work on new Macs with Apple Silicon.</p>
<p>And this time Rosetta is even faster, more powerful and more compatible.</p>
<p>It translates the apps when you install them,</p>
<p>so they can launch immediately and be instantly responsive.</p>
<p>And Rosetta 2 can also translate code on the fly when needed,</p>
<p>like for web browsers with just-in-time JavaScript compilers or for Java code.</p>
<p>It even handles the most complex Pro Apps and their plug-ins.</p>
<p>Rosetta 2 is transparent to users, and the performance is amazing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also introducing new Virtualization technologies in macOS Big Sur.</p>
<p>So, for developers who wanna run other environments like Linux</p>
<p>or tools like Docker, we have you covered.</p>
<p>When you put all of these technologies together,</p>
<p>Universal, Rosetta and Virtualization,</p>
<p>you have a system that can run an amazing diversity of apps.</p>
<p>To show you how this all comes together, I&rsquo;ll hand it over to Andreas Wendker.</p>
<p>Thanks, Craig.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at some existing apps running under Rosetta.</p>
<p>Rosetta, of course, works great with all sorts of apps you use every day.</p>
<p>But for our first demo, I&rsquo;d like to show you something a bit more challenging.</p>
<p>This is Maya, the powerful animation and modeling software</p>
<p>running great here on Apple Silicon.</p>
<p>I already have a model open that consists of over six million polygons</p>
<p>and, as you can see, I can fluidly move around in this scene.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s make it more challenging and bring in textures and shaders as well.</p>
<p>And still, everything is incredibly fluid.</p>
<p>So Rosetta works great, and the performance is simply fantastic.</p>
<p>But Rosetta isn&rsquo;t just for apps.</p>
<p>It also works amazingly well with games.</p>
<p>I can even use a game controller.</p>
<p>This is Shadow of the Tomb Raider,</p>
<p>a high-end AAA game that&rsquo;s using our Metal APIs.</p>
<p>I downloaded it directly from the Mac App Store,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s completely unmodified,</p>
<p>and it is absolutely beautiful.</p>
<p>Let me jump into the water.</p>
<p>You can see some of the lighting effects here.</p>
<p>And as I follow the path, you can see the game is responsive,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s smooth,</p>
<p>and the best part is, you&rsquo;re running the 1080p as a translated app</p>
<p>and an emulation.</p>
<p>So these new Macs, they are fast.</p>
<p>You can see some more of the lighting effects here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s awesome what Rosetta can do with existing games.</p>
<p>Now, as Craig mentioned, many of our users rely on apps from other environments.</p>
<p>So let me bring up a Linux VM in Parallels Desktop.</p>
<p>You can see the graphical user interface designed for Linux here.</p>
<p>But, of course, many developers like to use Linux for hosting servers.</p>
<p>So let me dive down to the command line and launch in Apache Web Server.</p>
<p>And now I can simply bring up Safari</p>
<p>and browse the website of the server I just launched in the Linux VM.</p>
<p>Here it is.</p>
<p>Now I want to show you one more type of app to run on these new Macs</p>
<p>that we haven&rsquo;t even told you about yet,</p>
<p>and that is iPhone and iPad apps.</p>
<p>Since they&rsquo;ve been built to run on the same Apple Silicon</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re using on our new Macs,</p>
<p>they will run natively, completely unmodified,</p>
<p>on the new Macs as well.</p>
<p>Let me show you a few.</p>
<p>This here is one of my favorite games, Monument Valley 2.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun to play here on the new Mac.</p>
<p>And if I want to catch up on my guitar lessons, I can use Fender Play.</p>
<p>[guitar plays]</p>
<p>Or if I want to relax at the end of the day a little bit,</p>
<p>I can bring up the Calm app.</p>
<p>And that was just a quick look at Rosetta, Virtualization</p>
<p>and support for iPhone and iPad apps, giving users amazing versatility</p>
<p>for running apps and other environments with macOS on Apple Silicon.</p>
<p>Back to you, Craig.</p>
<p>Thanks, Andreas.</p>
<p>As you saw,</p>
<p>Macs built with Apple Silicon will be able to run iPhone and iPad apps directly.</p>
<p>Starting day one, users can download these apps right from the Mac App Store,</p>
<p>and most apps will just work with no changes from the developer.</p>
<p>With everything we&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>the range of apps that users will be able to run on these new Macs</p>
<p>is truly unprecedented.</p>
<p>Together, we have all the technologies in place to make this an amazing transition.</p>
<p>The vast majority of Mac apps</p>
<p>can be recompiled as Universal in a few days,</p>
<p>so users can have fast, native apps.</p>
<p>Rosetta 2 runs existing Mac apps,</p>
<p>our Virtualization technology makes it easier than ever</p>
<p>to bring other environments, like Linux, to the Mac,</p>
<p>and Mac users can, for the first time, run iOS and iPadOS apps directly,</p>
<p>tapping into the world&rsquo;s most vital app ecosystem.</p>
<p>Now, we know our Mac developers will be eager to get started on this new platform.</p>
<p>So to get them going right away, we&rsquo;re launching a Quick Start Program.</p>
<p>The focus of the Quick Start Program</p>
<p>is to enable developers to make their apps Universal</p>
<p>and take advantage of all the capabilities of Apple Silicon.</p>
<p>Developers will have access to documentation and sample code,</p>
<p>forums on developer.apple.com,</p>
<p>priority DTS support incidents, and access to labs around the world.</p>
<p>This program also includes new Developer Transition Kit hardware</p>
<p>so developers can get going even before we ship production systems.</p>
<p>The DTK hardware takes the form of a Mac mini,</p>
<p>but one with an A12Z SoC inside.</p>
<p>It has desktop specs, including 16 gigabytes of memory,</p>
<p>a 512-gig SSD, and a complement of Mac I/O ports.</p>
<p>Most significantly, it will include</p>
<p>the macOS Big Sur developer beta and Xcode tools.</p>
<p>Developers will be able to apply to the program</p>
<p>at developer.apple.com today.</p>
<p>We will be shipping units out starting this week</p>
<p>so you can get to work.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how macOS Big Sur is paving the way</p>
<p>for a smooth transition to Apple Silicon.</p>
<p>This year, we&rsquo;re elevating the Mac to a whole new level.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an incredible opportunity for developers.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to see what you all create,</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t wait until we can all be together in person again.</p>
<p>And now, back to Tim.</p>
<p>Thank you, Craig, and thank you, Johny.</p>
<p>It truly is a historic day for the Mac.</p>
<p>Our vision for the Mac has always been about</p>
<p>embracing breakthrough innovation and having the courage</p>
<p>to make bold changes.</p>
<p>Every time we&rsquo;ve done this, the Mac has come out stronger and more capable.</p>
<p>And I have never been more confident</p>
<p>about the future of the Mac than I am today.</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s the timeline for this transition?</p>
<p>Well, for developers,</p>
<p>it begins this week with the valuable information</p>
<p>delivered at this conference as well as applying for the Quick Start Program.</p>
<p>And for the customers,</p>
<p>we expect to ship our first Mac with Apple Silicon by the end of this year,</p>
<p>and we expect the transition to take about two years.</p>
<p>We plan to continue to support and release new versions of macOS</p>
<p>for Intel-based Macs for years to come.</p>
<p>In fact, we have some new Intel-based Macs in the pipeline</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re really excited about.</p>
<p>What a huge leap forward for the Mac and for Apple.</p>
<p>Apple Silicon will bring amazing technologies,</p>
<p>industry-leading performance,</p>
<p>and a common architecture across all of our products.</p>
<p>What an incredible day of announcements.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;ve seen, we haven&rsquo;t stopped innovating.</p>
<p>We pushed all of our platforms forward in some amazing new ways.</p>
<p>Our OS releases will be available as developer betas today.</p>
<p>And each of them will have a public beta, including watchOS for the very first time,</p>
<p>starting next month.</p>
<p>And all of this great software will be available to our customers this fall.</p>
<p>We hope you&rsquo;ve enjoyed this very special keynote</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re ready for the big week ahead,</p>
<p>with over 100 engineering-led video sessions,</p>
<p>one-on-one consultations with Apple engineers,</p>
<p>and so much more.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t wait to start working with all of you</p>
<p>and watch you do the best work of your lives.</p>
<p>At Apple, we&rsquo;ve always drawn strength</p>
<p>from the diversity of our global community</p>
<p>because we truly believe when we all work together,</p>
<p>we can change the world for the better.</p>
<p>Thanks to you all for joining us.</p>
<p>This has been such a big day,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s only the beginning of a huge week to come.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s have a great WWDC.</p>
