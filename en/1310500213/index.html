    <p>The following is a conversation with Luis and Jo√£o Botala, brothers and cofounders of Fermat&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Library, which is an incredible platform for annotating papers. As they write on the Fermat&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Library website, just as Pierre de Fermat scribbled his famous last theorem in the margins, professional</p>
<p>scientists, academics, and citizen scientists can annotate equations, figures, ideas, and write</p>
<p>in the margins. Fermat&rsquo;s Library is also a really good Twitter account to follow. I highly recommend</p>
<p>it. They post little visual factoids and explorations that reveal the beauty of mathematics.</p>
<p>I love it. Quick mention of our sponsors. Skiff, SimplySafe, Indeed, NetSuite, and Four Sigmatic.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast. As a side note, let me say a few words</p>
<p>about the dissemination of scientific ideas. I believe that all scientific articles should be</p>
<p>freely accessible to the public. They currently are not. In one analysis I saw, more than 70%</p>
<p>of published research articles are behind a paywall. In case you don&rsquo;t know, the funders of</p>
<p>the research, whether that&rsquo;s government or industry, aren&rsquo;t the ones putting up the paywall. The journals</p>
<p>are the ones putting up the paywall, while using unpaid labor from researchers for the peer review</p>
<p>process. Where is all that money from the paywall going? In this digital age, the costs here should</p>
<p>be minimal. This cost can easily be covered through donation, advertisement, or public funding of</p>
<p>science. The benefit versus the cost of all papers being free to read is obvious, and the fact that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not free goes against everything science should stand for, which is the free dissemination</p>
<p>of ideas that educate and inspire. Science cannot be a gated institution. The more people can freely</p>
<p>learn and collaborate on ideas, the more problems we can solve in the world together, and the faster</p>
<p>we can drive old ideas out and bring new, better ideas in. Science is beautiful and powerful, and</p>
<p>its dissemination in this digital age should be free. This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>my conversation with Luis and Joao Batala. Luis, you suggested an interesting idea. Imagine if most</p>
<p>papers had a backstory section, the same way that they have an abstract. So knowing more about how</p>
<p>the authors ended up working on a paper can be extremely insightful. And then you went on to give</p>
<p>a backstory for the Feynman QED paper. This is all in a tweet, by the way. We&rsquo;re doing tweet analysis</p>
<p>today. How much of the human backstory do you think is important in understanding the idea itself</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s presented in the paper or in general? I think this gives way more context to the work of</p>
<p>scientists. I think people, a lot of people have this almost kind of romantic misconception that</p>
<p>the way a lot of scientists work is almost as the sum of eureka moments where all of a sudden they</p>
<p>sit down and start writing two papers in a row, and the papers are usually isolated. And when you</p>
<p>actually look at it, the papers are chapters of a way more complex story. And the Feynman QED paper</p>
<p>is a good example. So Feynman was actually going through a pretty dark phase before writing that</p>
<p>paper. He lost enthusiasm with physics and doing physics problems. And there was one time when he</p>
<p>was in the cafeteria of Cornell, and he saw a guy that was throwing plates in the air. And he noticed</p>
<p>that when the plate was in the air, there were two movements there. The plate was wobbling, but he</p>
<p>also noticed that the Cornell symbol was rotating. And he was able to figure out the equations of</p>
<p>motions of those plates. And that led him to kind of think a little bit about electron orbits in</p>
<p>relativity, which led to the paper about quantum electrodynamics. So that kind of reignited his</p>
<p>interest in physics and ended up publishing the paper that led to his Nobel Prize, basically.</p>
<p>And I think there are a lot of really interesting backstories about papers that readers never get to</p>
<p>know. For instance, we did a couple of months ago an AMA around a paper, a pretty famous paper,</p>
<p>the GAMS paper with Ian Goodfellow. And so we did an AMA where everyone could ask questions about</p>
<p>the paper, and Ian was responding to those questions. And he was also telling the story of</p>
<p>how he got the idea for that paper in a bar. So that was also an interesting backstory. I also</p>
<p>read a book by Cedric Villani. Cedric Villani is this mathematician, a Fields Medalist. And in his</p>
<p>book, he tries to explain how he got from a PhD student to the Fields Medal. And he tries to be</p>
<p>as descriptive as possible, every single step, how he got to the Fields Medal. And it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>also to see just the amount of random interactions and discussions with other researchers, sometimes</p>
<p>over coffee, and how it led to like fundamental breakthroughs and some of his most important</p>
<p>papers. So I think it&rsquo;s super interesting to have that context of the backstory.</p>
<p>Well, the Ian Goodfellow story is kind of interesting, and perhaps that&rsquo;s true for</p>
<p>Feynman as well. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s romanticizing the thing, but it seems like just a few little</p>
<p>insights and a little bit of work does most of the leap required. Do you have a sense that for a lot</p>
<p>of the stuff you&rsquo;ve looked at, just looking back through history, it wasn&rsquo;t necessarily the grind</p>
<p>of like Andrew Wiles or the Fermat&rsquo;s Last Theorem, for example. It was more like a brilliant moment</p>
<p>of insight. In fact, Ian Goodfellow has a kind of sadness to him almost, in that at that time in</p>
<p>machine learning, like at that time, especially for GANs, you could code something up really</p>
<p>quickly in a single machine and almost do the invention, go from idea to experimental validation</p>
<p>in like a single night, a single person could do it. And now there&rsquo;s kind of a sadness that a lot</p>
<p>of the breakthroughs you might have in machine learning kind of require large scale experiments.</p>
<p>So it was almost like the early days. So I wonder how many low hanging fruit there are</p>
<p>in science and mathematics and even engineering where it&rsquo;s like you could do that little experiment</p>
<p>quickly, like you have an insight in a bar. Why is it always a bar? But you have an insight at a bar</p>
<p>and then just implement and the world changes. It&rsquo;s a good point. I think it also depends a lot</p>
<p>on the maturity of the field. When you look at a field like mathematics, like it&rsquo;s a pretty mature</p>
<p>field, a field like machine learning, it&rsquo;s growing pretty fast. And it&rsquo;s actually pretty</p>
<p>interesting. I looked up like the number of new papers on archive with the keyword machine learning</p>
<p>and like 50% of those papers have been published in the last 12 months. So you can see just the</p>
<p>5.0, 50%. So you can see the magnitude of growth in that field. And so I think like as fields</p>
<p>mature, like those types of moments, I think naturally are less frequent. It&rsquo;s just a consequence</p>
<p>of that. The other point that is interesting about the backstory is that it can really make it</p>
<p>more memorable in a way. And by making it more memorable, it kind of sediments the knowledge</p>
<p>more in your mind. I remember also reading the sort of the backstory to Dijkstra&rsquo;s shortest path</p>
<p>algorithm. He came up with it essentially while he was sitting down at a coffee shop in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>And he came up with that algorithm over 20 minutes. And one interesting aspect is he didn&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>pen or paper at the time. And so he had to do it all in his mind. And so there&rsquo;s only so much</p>
<p>complexity that he can handle if you&rsquo;re just thinking about it in your mind. And that like</p>
<p>when you think about the simplicity of Dijkstra&rsquo;s shortest path finding algorithm, it&rsquo;s knowing that</p>
<p>backstory helps sediment that algorithm in your mind so that you don&rsquo;t forget about it as easily.</p>
<p>It might be from you that I saw a meme about Dijkstra. It&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s trying to solve it and</p>
<p>he comes up with some kind of random path. And then it&rsquo;s like my parents aren&rsquo;t home. And then</p>
<p>he does. He figures out the algorithm for the shortest path. He tried through words to convey</p>
<p>memes, but it&rsquo;s hilarious. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s in post that we construct stories that romanticize</p>
<p>it. Apparently with Newton, there was no apple. Especially when you&rsquo;re working on problems that</p>
<p>have a physical manifestation or a visual manifestation, it feels like the world</p>
<p>could be an inspiration to you. So it doesn&rsquo;t have to be completely on paper. Like you could</p>
<p>be sitting at a bar and all of a sudden see something and a pattern will spark another</p>
<p>pattern and you can visualize it and rethink a problem in a particular way. Of course, you can</p>
<p>also load the math that you have on paper and always carry that with you. So when you show up to</p>
<p>the bar, some little inspiration could be the thing that changes it. Is there any other people</p>
<p>almost on the human side, whether it&rsquo;s physics with Feynman,</p>
<p>Dirac, Einstein, or computer science, Turing, anybody else? Any backstories that you remember</p>
<p>that jump out? Because I&rsquo;m also referring to not necessarily these stories where something magical</p>
<p>happens, but these are personalities. They have big egos. Some of them are super friendly. Some of</p>
<p>them are like self obsessed. Some of them have anger issues. Some of them, how do I describe</p>
<p>Feynman? But he appears to have a appreciation of the beautiful in all its forms. He has a wit</p>
<p>and a cleverness and a humor about him. So does that come into play in terms of the construction</p>
<p>of the science? Well, I think you brought up Newton. Newton is a good example also to think</p>
<p>about his backstory because there&rsquo;s a certain backstory of Newton that people always talk about,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s a whole another aspect of him that is also a big part of the person that he was,</p>
<p>but he was really into alchemy and that he spent a lot of time thinking about that and writing</p>
<p>about it and he took it very seriously. He was really into Bible interpretation, trying to</p>
<p>predict things based on the Bible. And so there&rsquo;s also a whole backstory then and of course you need</p>
<p>to look at it in the context and the time that when Newton lived, but it adds to his personality</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s important to also understand those aspects that maybe people are not as proud to</p>
<p>teach to little kids, but it&rsquo;s important. It was part of who he was and maybe without those,</p>
<p>who knows what he would have done otherwise. Well, the cool thing about alchemy,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how it was viewed at the time, but it almost like to me symbolizes</p>
<p>dreaming of the impossible. Like most of the breakthrough ideas kind of seem impossible</p>
<p>until they&rsquo;re actually done. It&rsquo;s like achieving human flight. It&rsquo;s not completely obvious to me</p>
<p>that alchemy is impossible or putting myself in the mindset of the time. And perhaps even still,</p>
<p>everything that some of the most incredible breakthroughs would seem impossible.</p>
<p>And I wonder the value of believing, almost like focusing and dreaming of the impossible,</p>
<p>such that it actually is possible in your mind and that in itself manifests</p>
<p>whether the accomplishing that goal or making progress in some unexpected direction.</p>
<p>So alchemy almost symbolizes that for me. I distinctly remember having the same thought</p>
<p>of thinking, when I learned about atoms and that they have protons and electrons,</p>
<p>I was like, okay, to make gold, you just take whatever has an atomic weight below it and then</p>
<p>shove another proton in there and then you have a bunch of gold. So like, why don&rsquo;t people do that?</p>
<p>It seemed like conceptually is like, this sounds feasible. You might be able to do it,</p>
<p>you might be able to do it. And you can actually, it&rsquo;s just very, very expensive.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. So in a sense we do have alchemy and maybe even back then it wasn&rsquo;t as crazy that</p>
<p>he was so into it, but people just don&rsquo;t like to talk about that as much. But Newton in general</p>
<p>was a very interesting fellow. Anybody else come to mind? In terms of people that inspire you,</p>
<p>in terms of people that you just are happy that they have once or still exist on this earth?</p>
<p>I think, I mean, Freeman Dyson for me.</p>
<p>Yeah, Freeman Dyson was, I&rsquo;ve had a chance to actually exchange a couple of emails with him.</p>
<p>It was probably one of the most humble scientists that I&rsquo;ve ever met. And that had a big impact</p>
<p>on me. We were trying, we&rsquo;re actually trying to convince him to annotate a paper on Fermat&rsquo;s</p>
<p>library. And I sent him an email asking him if he could annotate a paper. And his response was</p>
<p>something like, I have very limited knowledge. I just know a couple of things about certain fields.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m qualified to do that. That was his first response. And this was someone that</p>
<p>should have won an Obel prize and worked on a bunch of different fields, did some really,</p>
<p>really great work. And then just the interactions that I had with him, every time I asked him a</p>
<p>couple of questions about his papers, and he always responded saying, I&rsquo;m not here to answer</p>
<p>your questions. I just want to open more questions. And so that had a big impact on me. It was like</p>
<p>just an example of an extremely humble, yet accomplished scientist. And Feynman was also</p>
<p>a big, big inspiration in the sense that he was able to be, again, extremely talented and scientist,</p>
<p>but at the same time, socially, he was able to, he was also really smart from a social perspective.</p>
<p>And he was able to interact with people. He was also a really good teacher and was also to did</p>
<p>awesome work in terms of explaining physics to the masses and motivating and getting people</p>
<p>interested in physics. And that for me was, was also a big inspiration.</p>
<p>Yeah. I liked the childlike curiosity of some of those folks that you mentioned,</p>
<p>Feynman. I&rsquo;ve, Daniel Kahneman, I got a chance to meet and interact with some of these truly</p>
<p>special scientists. What makes them special is that even in older age, there&rsquo;s still like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still that fire of childlike curiosity that burns. And some of that is like not taking</p>
<p>yourself so seriously that you think you&rsquo;ve figured it all out, but almost like thinking that</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know much of it. And that&rsquo;s like step one in having a great conversation or collaboration</p>
<p>or exploring a scientific question. And it&rsquo;s cool how the very thing that probably earned people</p>
<p>the Nobel prize or, or work that&rsquo;s seminal in some way is the very thing that still burns even after</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve won the prize. It&rsquo;s cool to see. And they&rsquo;re rare humans, it seems.</p>
<p>And to that point, I remember like the last email that I sent to Freeman Dyson was like in his last</p>
<p>birthday, he was really into number theory and primes. So what I did is I took like a photo of</p>
<p>him picture, and then I turned that into like a giant prime number. So I converted the picture</p>
<p>into a bunch of one and eights. And then I moved some numbers around until it was a prime. And</p>
<p>then I sent him that. Oh, so the, the visual, like it&rsquo;s still look like the picture, it&rsquo;s made up of</p>
<p>a prime. That&rsquo;s tricky to do. It&rsquo;s hard to do. It looks harder than it actually is. So the way you</p>
<p>do it is like you convert the darker regions into eights and the lighter regions in ones.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s&hellip; And then just keep flipping numbers until&hellip; But there&rsquo;s like some primality</p>
<p>tests that are cheaper from a computational standpoint. But what it gives you is like</p>
<p>it excludes numbers that are not prime. Then you end up with a set of numbers that you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if they are prime or not. And then you run the full primality test on that. So you just have to</p>
<p>keep iterating on that. And it was, it&rsquo;s funny because when you got the picture, it was like,</p>
<p>how did you do that? It was super curious too. And then we got into the details. And again,</p>
<p>this was, it was already 90, I think 92 or something. And that curiosity was still there.</p>
<p>So you can really see that in some of these scientists.</p>
<p>So could we talk about Fermat&rsquo;s library?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>What is it? What&rsquo;s the main goal? What&rsquo;s the dream?</p>
<p>It is a platform for annotating papers in its essence, right? And so academic papers can be</p>
<p>one of the densest forms of content out there and generally pretty hard to understand at times. And</p>
<p>the idea is that you can make them more accessible and easier to understand by adding these rich</p>
<p>annotations to the site, right? And so we can just imagine a PDF view on your browser, and then you</p>
<p>have annotations on each side. And then when you click on them, a sidebar expands and then you have</p>
<p>annotations that support LaTeX and Markdown. And so the idea is that you can, say, explain a</p>
<p>tougher part of a paper where there&rsquo;s a step that is not completely obvious. And then you can</p>
<p>add more context to it. And then over time, papers can become easier and easier to understand and can</p>
<p>evolve in a way. But it really came from myself, Luis, and two other friends. We&rsquo;ve had this</p>
<p>long running habit of kind of running a journal club amongst us. We come from different backgrounds,</p>
<p>right? I studied CS, we studied physics. And so we&rsquo;d read papers and present them to the</p>
<p>each other. And then we tried to bring some of that online. And that&rsquo;s when we decided to</p>
<p>build Fermat&rsquo;s library. And then over time, it kind of grew into something with a broader goal.</p>
<p>And really, what we&rsquo;re trying to do is trying to help move science in the right direction.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really the ultimate goal and where we want to take it now.</p>
<p>Well, so there&rsquo;s a lot to be said. So first of all, for people who haven&rsquo;t seen it,</p>
<p>the interface is exceptionally well done. Execution is really important here.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>The other thing is just to mention for a large number of people, apparently, which is new to me,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what LaTeX is. So it&rsquo;s spelled like LaTeX. So be careful googling it if you haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>before. It&rsquo;s a, sorry, I don&rsquo;t even know the correct terminology.</p>
<p>Type setting language?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a type setting language where you&rsquo;re basically program, writing a program that</p>
<p>then generates something that looks, from a typography perspective, beautiful.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And so a lot of academics use it to write papers. I think there&rsquo;s like a bunch of communities that</p>
<p>use it to write papers. I would say it&rsquo;s mathematics, physics, computer science.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, yeah, that&rsquo;s the main.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m collaborating currently on a paper with two neuroscientists from Stanford.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t know LaTeX.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m using Microsoft Word and Mendeley, and like all of those kinds of things. And I&rsquo;m being</p>
<p>very zen like about the whole process, but it&rsquo;s fascinating. It&rsquo;s a little heartbreaking actually,</p>
<p>because it actually, it&rsquo;s funny to say, but, and we&rsquo;ll talk about open science, actually,</p>
<p>the bigger mission behind Fermat&rsquo;s library is like,</p>
<p>really opening up the world of science to everybody. Is these silly two facts of like</p>
<p>one community uses LaTeX and another uses Word, is actually a barrier between them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s like boring and practical in a sense, but it makes it very difficult to collaborate.</p>
<p>Just on that, like, I think there are some people that should have received like a Nobel</p>
<p>Prize, but will never get it. And I think one of those is like Donald Knuth, because of tech</p>
<p>and LaTeX. And then, because it had a huge impact in terms of like just making it easier for</p>
<p>researchers to put their content out there, like making it uniform as much as possible.</p>
<p>Oh, you mean like a Nobel Peace Prize?</p>
<p>Maybe a Nobel Peace Prize. Maybe a Nobel Peace Prize. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe a Nobel Peace Prize. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think so.</p>
<p>I mean, he at a very young age, got the Turing Award for his work in algorithms and so on. So</p>
<p>like an incredibly, I think it&rsquo;s in, it might be even the sixties, but I think it&rsquo;s the seventies.</p>
<p>So when he was really young and then he went on to do like incredible work with his book</p>
<p>and yeah, with tech that people don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And going back just on the reason why we ended up, because I think this is interesting. The reason</p>
<p>why we ended up using the name Fermat&rsquo;s Library, this was because of Fermat&rsquo;s Last Theorem. And</p>
<p>Fermat&rsquo;s Last Theorem is actually a funny story. So Pierre de Fermat, he was like a lawyer and he</p>
<p>wrote like on a book that he had a solution to Fermat&rsquo;s Last Theorem, which, but that didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fit the margin of that book. And so Fermat&rsquo;s Last Theorem basically states that there&rsquo;s no solution.</p>
<p>If you have integers a, b and c, there&rsquo;s no solution to a to the power of n plus b to the</p>
<p>power of n equals to c to the power of n, if n is bigger than two. So there&rsquo;s no solutions.</p>
<p>And he said that, and that problem remained open for almost 300 years, I believe. And a lot of the</p>
<p>most famous mathematicians tried to tackle that problem. No one was able to figure that out until</p>
<p>Andrew Wiles, I think was in the 90s, was able to publish the solution, which was, I believe, almost</p>
<p>300 pages long. And so it&rsquo;s kind of an anecdote that, you know, there&rsquo;s a lot of knowledge and</p>
<p>insights that can be trapped in the margins. And there&rsquo;s a lot of potential energy that you can</p>
<p>release if you actually spend some time trying to digest that. And that was the origin story for</p>
<p>for the name. Yes, you can share the contents of the margins with the world that could inspire</p>
<p>a solution or a communication that then leads to a solution. And if you think about papers,</p>
<p>like papers are, as Joan was saying, probably one of the densest pieces of text that any human can</p>
<p>read. And you have these researchers, like some of the brightest minds in these fields, working on</p>
<p>like new discoveries and publishing these work on journals that are imposing them restrictions in</p>
<p>terms of the number of pages that they can have to explain a new scientific breakthrough. So at the</p>
<p>end of the day, papers are not optimized for clarity and for a proper explanation of that</p>
<p>content because there are so many restrictions. So there&rsquo;s, as I mentioned, there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>potential energy that can be freed if you actually try to digest a lot of the contents of papers.</p>
<p>Trey Lockerbie Can you explain some of the other things? So margins, librarian, journal club?</p>
<p>Ofer Yusuf So journal club is what a lot of people know us for, where we every week,</p>
<p>we release an annotated paper and in all sorts of different fields, but physics, CS, math,</p>
<p>margins is kind of the same software that we use to run the journal club and to</p>
<p>host the annotations. But we&rsquo;ve made that available for free to anybody that wants to use it. And so</p>
<p>folks use it at universities and for running journal clubs. And so we&rsquo;ve just made that freely</p>
<p>available. And then librarian is a browser extension that we developed that is sort of an</p>
<p>overlay on top of archive. So it&rsquo;s about bringing some of the same functionality around comments,</p>
<p>plus adding some extra niceties to archive, like being able to very easily extract the references</p>
<p>of a paper that you&rsquo;re looking at or being able to extract the bib deck in order to cite that</p>
<p>paper yourself. So it&rsquo;s an overlay on top of archive. The idea is that you can have that</p>
<p>commenting interface without having to leave archive. Trey Lockerbie It&rsquo;s kind of incredible.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know about it. And once I learned of it, it&rsquo;s like, holy shit. Why isn&rsquo;t it more popular,</p>
<p>given how popular archive is? Like everybody should be using it. Archive sucks in terms of</p>
<p>its interface. Let me rephrase that. It&rsquo;s limited in terms of its interface.</p>
<p>Archive is a pretty incredible project. And it is, in a way, the growth has been completely</p>
<p>linear over time. If you look at the number of papers published on archive, it&rsquo;s pretty much</p>
<p>a straight line for the past 20 years. Especially if you&rsquo;re coming from a startup background and</p>
<p>then you were trying to do archive, you&rsquo;d probably try all sorts of growth acts and try to then maybe</p>
<p>have paid features and things like that. And that would kind of maybe ruin it. And so there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>subtle balance there. And I don&rsquo;t know what aspects you can change about it.</p>
<p>For some tools in science, it just takes time for them to grow. Archive has just turned 30,</p>
<p>I believe. And for people that don&rsquo;t know, archive is these kind of online repositories</p>
<p>where people put preprints, which are versions of the papers, before they actually make it to journals.</p>
<p>A R X I V, for people who don&rsquo;t know. And it&rsquo;s actually a really vibrant place to publish your</p>
<p>papers in the aforementioned communities of mathematics, physics, and computer science.</p>
<p>It started with mathematics and physics, and then over the last 30 years, it evolved. And now,</p>
<p>actually computer science now, it&rsquo;s a more popular category than physics and math on archive.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also, which I don&rsquo;t know very much about, like a biology, medical version of that.</p>
<p>Bioarchive. Yeah, bioarchive. It&rsquo;s interesting because if you look at these platforms for</p>
<p>preprints, they actually play a super important role. Because if you look at a category like math,</p>
<p>for some papers in math, it might take close to three years after you click upload paper on the</p>
<p>journal website, and the paper gets published on the website of the journal. So this is literally</p>
<p>the longest upload period on the internet. And during those three years, their content is just</p>
<p>locked. And so that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so important for people to have websites that are open to</p>
<p>people to have websites like archive so that you can share that before it goes to the journal</p>
<p>with the rest of the world. There was actually on archive that Perelman published the three</p>
<p>papers that led to the proof of the Poincare conjecture. And then you have other fields like</p>
<p>machine learning, for instance, where the field is evolving at such a high rate that people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even wait before the papers go to journals before they start working on top of those papers. So they</p>
<p>publish them on archive, then other people see them, they start working on that. And archive did</p>
<p>a really good job at building that core platform to host papers. But I think there&rsquo;s a really,</p>
<p>really big opportunity in building more features on top of that platform, apart from just hosting</p>
<p>papers. So collaboration, annotations, and having other things apart from papers like code</p>
<p>and other things. Because, for instance, in the field like machine learning,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a really big, as I mentioned, people start working on top of preprints, and they are</p>
<p>assuming that preprint is correct. But you really need a way, for instance, to maybe, it&rsquo;s not peer</p>
<p>review, but distinguish what is good work from bad work on archive. How do you do that? So like</p>
<p>a commenting interface like librarian, it&rsquo;s useful for that so that you can distinguish that in a</p>
<p>field that is growing so fast as machine learning. And then you have platforms that focus, for</p>
<p>instance, on just biology. BioArchive is a good example. BioArchive is also super interesting</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s actually an interesting experiment that was run in the 60s. So in the 60s, the NIH</p>
<p>supported this experiment called the Information Exchange Group, which at the time was a way for</p>
<p>researchers to share biology preprints via mail or using libraries. And that project in the 1960s</p>
<p>got canceled six years after it started. And it was due to intense pressure from the journals</p>
<p>to kill that project because they were fearing competition from the preprints for the journal</p>
<p>industry. Crick was one of the famous scientists that opposed to the Information Exchange Group.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting because right now, if you analyze the number of biology papers that appear</p>
<p>first as preprints, it&rsquo;s only 2% of the papers. And this was almost 50 years after that first</p>
<p>experiment. So you can see that pressure from the journals to cancel that initial version of a</p>
<p>preprint repo had a tremendous impact on the number of papers that are showing up in biology</p>
<p>as preprints. So it delayed a lot that revolution. But now platforms like BioArchive are doing that</p>
<p>work. But there&rsquo;s still a lot of room for growth there. And I think it&rsquo;s super important because</p>
<p>those are the papers that are open that everyone can read. Okay. But if we just look at the entire</p>
<p>process of science as a big system, can we just talk about how it can be revolutionized? So you</p>
<p>have an idea, depending on the field, you want to make that idea concrete, you want to run a few</p>
<p>experiments in computer science, there might be some code, there&rsquo;d be a data set for, you know,</p>
<p>some of the more sort of biology, psychology, you might be collecting the data set that&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>you know, a study, right? So that&rsquo;s part of that, that&rsquo;s part of the methodology.</p>
<p>And so you are putting all that into a paper form. And then you have some results. And then you</p>
<p>submit that to a place for review through the peer review process. And there&rsquo;s a process where,</p>
<p>how would you summarize the peer review process? But it&rsquo;s really just like a handful of people look</p>
<p>over your paper and comment. And based on that, decide whether your paper is good or not. So</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole broken nature to it. At the same time, I love the peer review process when I buy</p>
<p>stuff on Amazon, like for like the commenting system, whatever that is. So, okay. So there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a bunch of possibilities for revolutions there. And then there&rsquo;s the other side, which is the</p>
<p>collaborative aspect of the science, which is people annotating, people commenting, sort of the</p>
<p>low effort collaboration, which is a comment. Sometimes, as you&rsquo;ve talked about, a comment can</p>
<p>change everything. But, you know, or a higher effort collaboration, like more like maybe</p>
<p>annotations, or even like contributing to the paper, you can think of like, collaborative</p>
<p>updating of the paper over time. So there&rsquo;s all these possibilities for doing things better than</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been done. Can we talk about some ideas in this space? Some ideas that you&rsquo;re working on,</p>
<p>some ideas that you&rsquo;re not yet working on, but should be revolutionized? Because it does seem</p>
<p>that archive and like open review, for example, are like the craigslist of science. Like,</p>
<p>like, yeah, okay. I&rsquo;m very grateful that we have it. But it just feels like, it&rsquo;s like 10 to 20</p>
<p>years. Like, it doesn&rsquo;t feel like that&rsquo;s a feature. The simplicity of it is a feature. It feels like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a bug. But then again, the pushback there is Wikipedia has the same kind of simplicity</p>
<p>to it. And it seems to work exceptionally well in the crowdsourcing aspect of it. So I&rsquo;m sorry,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of stuff going on on the table. Let&rsquo;s just pick random things that we can talk</p>
<p>about. Wikipedia, you know, for me, it&rsquo;s the cosmological constant of the internet. It&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I think we are lucky to live in the parallel universe where Wikipedia exists. Yes. Because</p>
<p>if someone had pitched me Wikipedia, like a publicly edited encyclopedia, like a couple of</p>
<p>years ago, like it would be, I don&rsquo;t know how many people would have said that that would have</p>
<p>survived. I mean, it makes almost no sense. It&rsquo;s like having a Google doc that everybody on the</p>
<p>internet can edit. And like, that will be like the most reliable source for knowledge. And I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know how many, but hundreds of thousands of topics. Yeah. It&rsquo;s insane. It&rsquo;s insane. And like you have,</p>
<p>and then you have users, like there&rsquo;s one single user that edited one third of the articles on</p>
<p>Wikipedia. So we have these really, really big power users. There are a substantial part of like</p>
<p>what makes Wikipedia successful. And so like, no one would have ever imagined that that could</p>
<p>happen. And so that&rsquo;s one thing. I completely agree with what you just said. I also&hellip;</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt briefly. Maybe let&rsquo;s inject that into the discussion of everything else.</p>
<p>I also believe, I&rsquo;ve seen that with Stack Overflow, that one individual or a small collection of</p>
<p>individuals contribute or revolutionized most of the community. Like if you create a really</p>
<p>powerful system for archive or like open review and made it really easy and compelling and exciting</p>
<p>for one person who is like a 10x contributor to do their thing, that&rsquo;s going to change everything.</p>
<p>It seems like that was the mechanism that changed everything for Wikipedia. And that&rsquo;s the mechanism</p>
<p>that changed everything for Stack Overflow. Is gamifying or making it exciting or just making</p>
<p>it fun or pleasant or fulfilling in some way for those people who are insane enough to like answer</p>
<p>thousands of questions or write thousands of factoids and like research them and check them,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things, or read thousands of papers.</p>
<p>Yeah. No, Stack Overflow is another great example of that. And it&rsquo;s just, and those are both to</p>
<p>do incredibly productive communities that generate a ton of value and capture almost none of it.</p>
<p>Right. And it&rsquo;s in a way, it&rsquo;s almost like, it&rsquo;s very counterintuitive that these communities would</p>
<p>exist and thrive. And it&rsquo;s really hard to, there aren&rsquo;t that many communities like that.</p>
<p>Right. So how do we do that for science? Do you have ideas there?</p>
<p>Like what are the biggest problems that you see? You&rsquo;re working on some of them.</p>
<p>Like just on that, there are a couple of really interesting experiments that people are running.</p>
<p>An example would be like the Polymath projects. So this is a kind of a social experiment that was</p>
<p>created by Tim Gowers, Fields Medalist. And his idea was to try to prove that,</p>
<p>is it possible to do mathematics in a massively collaborative way on the internet? So he decided</p>
<p>to pick a couple of problems and test that. And they found out that it actually is possible for</p>
<p>specific types of problems, namely problems that you&rsquo;re able to break down in little pieces and</p>
<p>go step by step. You might need, as with open source, you might need people that are just kind</p>
<p>of reorganizing the house every once in a while. And then people throw a bunch of ideas and then</p>
<p>you make some progress, then you reorganize, you reframe the problem and you go step by step.</p>
<p>But they were actually able to prove that it is possible to collaborate online and do progress</p>
<p>in terms of mathematics. And so I&rsquo;m confident that there are other avenues that could be</p>
<p>explored here. Can we talk about peer review, for example?</p>
<p>Absolutely. I think in terms of the peer review, I think it&rsquo;s important to look at the bigger</p>
<p>picture here of what the scientific publishing ecosystem looks like. Because for me, there are</p>
<p>a lot of things that are wrong about that entire process. So if you look at what publishing means</p>
<p>in a traditional journal, you have journals that pay authors for their articles, and then they might</p>
<p>pay reviewers to review those articles. And finally, they pay people or distributors to</p>
<p>distribute the content. In the scientific publishing world, you have scientists that are</p>
<p>usually backed by government grants. They are giving away their work for free in the form of</p>
<p>papers. And then you have other scientists that are reviewing their work. This process is known</p>
<p>as the peer review process, again for free. And then finally, we have government backed</p>
<p>universities and libraries that are buying back all that work so that other scientists can read.</p>
<p>So this is, for me, it&rsquo;s bizarre. You have the government that is funding the research,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s paying the salaries of the scientists, it&rsquo;s paying the salaries of the reviewers,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s buying back all that product of their work again. And I think the problem with this</p>
<p>system and it&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so difficult to break this suboptimal equilibrium is because of the way</p>
<p>academia works right now and the way you can progress in your academic life. And so in a lot</p>
<p>of fields, the competition in academia is really insane. So you have hundreds of PhD students,</p>
<p>they are trying to get to a professor position and it&rsquo;s hyper competitive. And the only way for</p>
<p>you to get there is if you publish papers, ideally in journals with a high impact factor.</p>
<p>In computer science, it&rsquo;s often conferences are also very prestigious or actually more</p>
<p>prestigious than journals now. So that&rsquo;s the one discipline where, I mean, that has to do</p>
<p>with the thing we&rsquo;ve discussed in terms of how quickly the field turns around. But like NeurIPS,</p>
<p>CVPR, those conferences are more prestigious, or at the very least as prestigious as the journals.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t matter. The process is what it is.</p>
<p>So for people that don&rsquo;t know, the impact factor of a journal is basically the average number of</p>
<p>citations that a paper would get if it gets published on that journal. But so you can really</p>
<p>think that the problem with the impact factor is that it&rsquo;s a way to turn papers into accounting</p>
<p>units. And let me unpack this because the impact factor is almost like a nobility title. Because</p>
<p>papers are born with impact even before anyone reads them. So the researchers, they don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the incentive to care about if this paper is going to have a long term impact on the world.</p>
<p>What they care, their goal, their end goal is the paper to get published so that they get that</p>
<p>value upfront. So for me, that is one of the problems of that. And that really creates a</p>
<p>tyranny of metrics. Because at the end of the day, if you are a dean, what you want to hire is</p>
<p>people, researchers that publish papers on journals with high impact factors because that will</p>
<p>increase the ranking of your university and will allow you to charge more for tuition,</p>
<p>so on and so forth. And that, especially when you are in super competitive areas,</p>
<p>that people will try to gamify that system and misconduct starts showing up. There&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>interesting book on this topic called Gaming the Metrics. It&rsquo;s a book by a researcher called Mario</p>
<p>Biagioli. It goes a lot into how the impact factor and metrics affect science negatively.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting to think, especially in terms of citations, if you look at the early work of</p>
<p>looking at citations, there was a lot of work that was done by a guy called Eugene Garfield.</p>
<p>And this guy, the early work in terms of citation, they wanted to use citations from a descriptive</p>
<p>point of view. So what they wanted to create was a map. And that map would create a visual</p>
<p>representation of influence. So citations would be links between papers. And ideally, what they</p>
<p>would show, they would represent is that you read someone else&rsquo;s paper and it had an impact on your</p>
<p>research. They weren&rsquo;t supposed to be counted. I think this inspired Larry and Sergey&rsquo;s work for</p>
<p>Google. Exactly. I think they even mentioned that. But what happens is, as you start counting</p>
<p>citations, you create a market. And the work of Eugene Garfield was a big inspiration for Larry</p>
<p>and Sergey and for the PageRank algorithm that led to the creation of Google. And they even</p>
<p>recognized that. And if you think about it, it&rsquo;s like the same way there&rsquo;s a gigantic market for</p>
<p>search engine optimization, SEO, where people try to optimize the PageRank and how a web page will</p>
<p>rank on Google. The same will happen for papers. People will try to optimize the impact factors</p>
<p>and the citations that they get. And that creates a really big problem. And it&rsquo;s super interesting</p>
<p>to actually analyze them. If you look at the distribution of the impact factors of journals,</p>
<p>you have like Nature. Nature, I believe, is in the low 40s. And then you have, I believe, Science</p>
<p>is high 30s. And then you have a really good set of good journals that will fall between 10 and 30.</p>
<p>And then you have a gigantic tale of journals that have impact factor below 2. And you can really</p>
<p>see two economies here. You see the universities that are maybe less prestigious, less known,</p>
<p>where the faculty are pressured to just publish papers regardless of the journal. What I want to</p>
<p>do is increase the ranking of my university. And so they end up publishing as many papers as they</p>
<p>can in journals with low impact factor. And unfortunately, this represents a lot of the</p>
<p>global south. And then you have the luxury good economy. And there are also problems here in</p>
<p>the luxury good economy. So if you look at the journal like Nature, so with impact factor in</p>
<p>the low 40s, there&rsquo;s no way that you&rsquo;re going to be able to sustain that level of impact factor</p>
<p>by just grabbing the attention of scientists. What I mean by that is for the journals,</p>
<p>the articles that get published in Nature, they need to be New York Times grade. So they need to</p>
<p>make it to the big media. They need to be captured by the big media. And because that&rsquo;s the only way</p>
<p>for you to capture enough attention to sustain that level of citations. And that, of course,</p>
<p>creates problems because people then will try to, again, gamify the system and have like titles or</p>
<p>abstracts or that are bigger, make claims that are bigger than what is actually can be, you know,</p>
<p>sustained by the data or the content of the paper. And you&rsquo;ll have clickbait titles or clickbait</p>
<p>abstracts. And again, this is all a consequence of science or metrics. And this is a very dangerous</p>
<p>cycle that I think it&rsquo;s very hard to break, but it&rsquo;s happening in academia in a lot of fields</p>
<p>right now. Is it fundamentally the existence of metrics or the metrics just need to be</p>
<p>significantly improved? Because like I said, the metrics used for Amazon for purchasing,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, computer parts is pretty damn good in terms of selecting which are the good ones,</p>
<p>which are not. In that same way, if we had Amazon type of review system in the space of ideas,</p>
<p>in the space of science, it feels like that those metrics would be a little bit better.</p>
<p>Sort of when it&rsquo;s significantly more open to the crowdsource nature of the internet,</p>
<p>of the scientific internet, meaning as opposed to, like my biggest problem with peer review</p>
<p>has always been that it&rsquo;s like five, six, seven people, usually even less. And it&rsquo;s often,</p>
<p>nobody&rsquo;s incentivized to do a good job in the whole process. Meaning it&rsquo;s anonymous in a way</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t incentivize, like doesn&rsquo;t gamify or incentivize great work. And also it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily have to be anonymous. Like there has to be, the entire system is, doesn&rsquo;t encourage</p>
<p>actual sort of rigorous review. For example, like open review does kind of incentivize that kind of</p>
<p>process of collaborative review, but it&rsquo;s also imperfect. But it just feels like the thing that</p>
<p>Amazon has, which is like thousands of people contributing their reviews to a product,</p>
<p>it feels like that could be applied to science where the same kind of thing you&rsquo;re doing with</p>
<p>Fermat&rsquo;s library, but doing at a scale that&rsquo;s much larger. It feels like that should be possible</p>
<p>given the number of grad students, given the number of general public that&rsquo;s getting,</p>
<p>for example, I personally, as a person who got an education in mathematics and computer science,</p>
<p>like I can be a quote unquote, like reviewer on a lot bigger set of things than is my exact</p>
<p>expertise. If I&rsquo;m one of thousands of reviewers, if I&rsquo;m the only reviewer, one of five,</p>
<p>then I better be like an expert in the thing. But if I, and I&rsquo;ve learned this with COVID,</p>
<p>which is like, you can just use your basic skills as a data analyst to contribute to</p>
<p>the review process and a particular little aspect of a paper and be able to comment, be able to</p>
<p>sort of draw in some references that challenge the ideas presented or to enrich the ideas that</p>
<p>are presented. It just feels like crowdsourcing the review process would be able to allow you to have</p>
<p>metrics in terms of how good a paper is that are much better representative of its actual impact</p>
<p>in the world, of its actual value to the world, as opposed to some kind of arbitrary, gamified</p>
<p>version of its impact. I agree with that. I think there&rsquo;s definitely the possibility,</p>
<p>at least for a more resilient system than what we have today. And I think that&rsquo;s kind of what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re describing, Alex. I mean, to an extent, we kind of have like a little bit of a Heisenberg</p>
<p>uncertainty principle. When you pick a metric, as soon as you do it, then maybe it works as a good</p>
<p>heuristic for a short amount of time, but soon enough, people would start gamifying. But then</p>
<p>you can definitely have metrics that are more resilient to gamification and they&rsquo;ll work as a</p>
<p>better heuristic to try to push you in the best direction. But I guess down the line,</p>
<p>the underlying problem you&rsquo;re saying is there&rsquo;s a shortage of positions in academia. That&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>problem for me. Yeah. And that, and so they&rsquo;re going to be constantly gamifying the metrics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit of a zero sum game. It&rsquo;s a very competitive field. And that&rsquo;s what usually</p>
<p>happens in very competitive fields. Yeah. Yeah. But I think some of the peer review problems,</p>
<p>like scale helps, I think. And it&rsquo;s interesting to look at what you&rsquo;re mentioning, breaking it</p>
<p>down, maybe in like smaller parts and having more people jumping in. But this is definitely</p>
<p>a problem. And the peer review problem, as I mentioned, is correlated with the problem of</p>
<p>academic career progression. And it&rsquo;s all intertwined. And that&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s so hard</p>
<p>to break it. There are a couple of really interesting things that are being done right</p>
<p>now. There are a couple of, for instance, journals that are overlay journals on top of</p>
<p>platforms like archive and bio archive that want to remove like the more traditional journals from</p>
<p>the equation. So essentially a journal is just a collection of links to papers. And what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to do is like removing that middleman and trying to make the review process a little bit</p>
<p>more transparent and not charging universities. There are a couple of more famous ones. There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one discrete analysis in mathematics. There&rsquo;s one called the quantum journal, which we&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>working with them. We have a partnership with them for the papers that get published in quantum</p>
<p>journal. They also get the annotations on formats and they&rsquo;re doing pretty well. They&rsquo;ve been able</p>
<p>to grow substantially. The problem there is getting to critical mass. So it&rsquo;s again, convincing the</p>
<p>researchers and especially the young researchers that need that impact factor, need those</p>
<p>publications to have citations to not publish on the traditional journal and go on an open journal</p>
<p>and publish their work there. There, I think there are a couple of really high profile scientists of</p>
<p>people like Tim Gowers. They are trying to incentivize like famous scientists that already</p>
<p>have tenure and that don&rsquo;t need that to publish that to increase the reputation of those journals.</p>
<p>So that other maybe younger scientists can start publishing on those as well. And so that you can</p>
<p>try to break that vicious cycle of the more traditional journals.</p>
<p>I mean, another possible way to break this cycle is to like raise public awareness and just by</p>
<p>force, like ban paid journals. Like what exactly are they contributing to the world? Like basically</p>
<p>making it illegal to forget the fact that it&rsquo;s mostly federally funded. So that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a super ugly picture too. But like, why should knowledge be so expensive? Like where everyone</p>
<p>is working for the public good. And then there&rsquo;s these gatekeepers that, you know, most people</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t read most papers without having to pay money. And that&rsquo;s, that doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like that, that should be illegal.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re saying is exactly right. I mean, for instance,</p>
<p>right, I went to school here in the US, we studied in Europe, and you would sit like you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>ask me all the time to download papers and send it to him because he just couldn&rsquo;t get it. And like</p>
<p>papers that he needed for his research. And so,</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s a student, like he&rsquo;s a grad student.</p>
<p>He was a grad student. But that, you know, I&rsquo;m even referring to just regular people.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Okay. That too. Yeah.</p>
<p>And I think during 2020, because of COVID, a lot of journals put down the</p>
<p>walls for certain kind of coronavirus related papers. But like, that just gave me an indication</p>
<p>that like, this should be done for everything. It&rsquo;s absurd. Like people should be outraged</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s these gates. Because, so the moment you dissolve the journals,</p>
<p>then there will be an opportunity for startups to build stuff on top of archive. It&rsquo;d be an</p>
<p>opportunity for like, for my library to step up to scale up to something much even larger.</p>
<p>I mean, that was the original dream of Google, which I&rsquo;ve always admired, which is make the</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s information accessible. Actually, it&rsquo;s interesting that Google hasn&rsquo;t, maybe you guys</p>
<p>can correct me, but they put together Google Scholar, which is incredible. But they, and they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>did the scanning of books, but they haven&rsquo;t really tried to make science accessible in the following</p>
<p>way. Like, besides doing Google Scholar, they haven&rsquo;t like delved into the papers, right?</p>
<p>Which is especially curious given what Luis was saying, right? That it&rsquo;s kind of in their genesis.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this, you know, research that was very connected with how papers reference each other</p>
<p>and like building a network out of that. Interestingly enough, like Google, I think there was a,</p>
<p>there was not intended, Google Plus was like the Google social network that got cancelled, was used</p>
<p>by a lot of researchers. Yes, it was. Which I think was just a, you know, side, kind of a side effect.</p>
<p>But then a lot of people ended up migrating to Twitter, but it was not on purpose. But yeah,</p>
<p>I agree with you. Like they haven&rsquo;t gone past Google Scholar and I don&rsquo;t know why. Well, that said,</p>
<p>Google Scholar is incredible. For people who are not familiar, it&rsquo;s one of the best aggregation of</p>
<p>all the scientific work that&rsquo;s out there and especially the network that connects to all of</p>
<p>them. What sites, what. And also trying to aggregate all of the versions of the papers that are</p>
<p>available there and trying to merge them in a way that one particular work, even though it&rsquo;s available</p>
<p>in a bunch of places, counts as, you know, like a central hub of what that work is, according to</p>
<p>multiple versions. But that almost seems like a fun pet project of a couple of engineers within</p>
<p>within Google, as opposed to a serious effort to make the world science accessible. But going back</p>
<p>to just the journals, when you&rsquo;re talking about that, Lex, I believe that in that front, I think</p>
<p>we might be past the event horizon. So I think the model, the business model for the journals,</p>
<p>you know, doesn&rsquo;t make sense. They&rsquo;re a middle layer that is not adding a lot of value. And you</p>
<p>see a lot of motions, whereas like in Europe, a lot of the papers that are funded by the European</p>
<p>Union, they will have to be open to the public. And I think there&rsquo;s a lot of&hellip; Bill Gates too,</p>
<p>like what the Gates Foundation funds, like the demand that it&rsquo;s accessible to everybody.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s a question of time before that wall kind of falls. And that is going to open a</p>
<p>lot of possibilities. Because, you know, imagine if you had like the layer of that gigantic layer</p>
<p>of papers all available online, you know, that unlocks a lot of potential as a platform for</p>
<p>people to build things on top of that. But to what you&rsquo;re saying, it is weird, like you can literally</p>
<p>go and listen to any song that was ever made on your phone, right? You open Spotify and you might</p>
<p>not even pay for it. You might be on the free version and you can listen to any song that was</p>
<p>ever made, pretty much. But there&rsquo;s like, you don&rsquo;t have access to a huge percentage of academic</p>
<p>papers, which is just like this fundamental knowledge that we&rsquo;re all funding. But you as an</p>
<p>individual don&rsquo;t have access to it. And some of it, you know, you don&rsquo;t have access to, you know,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have access to it. And somehow, you know, like the problem for music got solved. But for</p>
<p>papers, it&rsquo;s still like&hellip; It&rsquo;s just not yet. It could be ad supported, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And then hopefully, that would change the way we do science. This is the most exciting thing for me</p>
<p>is, especially once I started like making videos and this silly podcast thing, I started to realize</p>
<p>like that if you want to do science, one of the most effective ways is to do like couple the</p>
<p>paper with a set of YouTube videos, like explaining it. That also seems like there&rsquo;s a lot of room for</p>
<p>disruption there. What is the paper 2.0 going to look like? I think like LaTeX and the PDF,</p>
<p>seems like if you&hellip; It&rsquo;s interesting. If you look at the first paper that got published in Nature,</p>
<p>and if you look at the paper that got published in Nature today, if you look at the two side by</p>
<p>side, they are fundamentally the same. And even though like the paper that gets published today,</p>
<p>you know, you get&hellip; Even code, like right now, people put like code, like on a PDF.</p>
<p>And there are so many things that are related to papers today, you know, you have data,</p>
<p>you have code, you might need videos to better explain the concepts. So, I think for me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s natural that there&rsquo;s going to be also an evolution there, that papers are not going to be</p>
<p>just the static PDFs or LaTeX, there&rsquo;s going to be a next interface. So, in academia, a lot of</p>
<p>things that are judged, you&rsquo;re judged by is often quantity, not quality. I wonder if there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>opportunity to have like&hellip; I tend to judge people by the best work they&rsquo;ve ever done as opposed to&hellip;</p>
<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s a possibility for that to encourage sort of focusing on the quality,</p>
<p>and not necessarily in paper form, but maybe a subset of a paper, subset of idea, almost even a</p>
<p>blog post or an experiment. Like, why does it have to be published in a journal to be legitimate?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting that you mentioned that I also think like, yeah, it&rsquo;s why is that the only</p>
<p>format? Why can&rsquo;t a blog post or&hellip; We were even experimenting with these a few months ago,</p>
<p>or can you actually like publish something or like a new scientific breakthrough or</p>
<p>something that you&rsquo;ve discovered in the form of like a set of tweets,</p>
<p>a Twitter thread. Why can&rsquo;t that be possible? And we were experimenting with that idea.</p>
<p>We even, yeah, we ran a couple of&hellip; Like some people submitted a couple of those,</p>
<p>like I think the limit was three or four tweets. Maybe it&rsquo;s a new way to look at a proof or</p>
<p>something, but I think it just serves to show that there should be other ways to publish</p>
<p>like scientific discoveries that don&rsquo;t fit the paper format. Well, but so even with the Twitter</p>
<p>thread, it would be nice to have some mechanism of formalizing it and making it into an NFT.</p>
<p>Like a concrete thing that you can reference as a link that&rsquo;s unique. Because, I mean, everything</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been saying, all of that, while being true, it&rsquo;s also true that the constraints and the</p>
<p>formalism of a paper works well. It like forces you, constraints forces you to narrow down your</p>
<p>thing and literally put it on paper. But, you know, make concrete. And that&rsquo;s why, I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not broken. It just could be better. And that&rsquo;s the main idea. I think there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about writing, whether it&rsquo;s a blog post or Twitter thread or a paper, that&rsquo;s really nice to</p>
<p>concretize a particular little idea that can then be referenced by other ideas, then it can be built</p>
<p>on top of with other ideas. So let me ask, you&rsquo;ve read quite a few papers. You&rsquo;ve annotated quite a</p>
<p>few papers. Let&rsquo;s talk about the process itself. How do you advise people read papers? Or maybe</p>
<p>you want to broaden it beyond just papers, but just read concrete pieces of information to</p>
<p>understand the insights that labeled in. I would say for paper specifically, I would bring back</p>
<p>kind of what Louise was talking about, is that it&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that papers are</p>
<p>not optimized for ease of understanding. And so, right, there&rsquo;s all sorts of restrictions and size</p>
<p>and format and language that they can use. And so it&rsquo;s important to keep that in mind. And so that</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re struggling to read a paper, that might not mean that the underlying material is actually</p>
<p>that hard. And so that&rsquo;s definitely something that, especially for us, that we read papers and</p>
<p>most of the time the papers are completely outside of our comfort zone, I guess. And so it would be</p>
<p>completely new areas to us. So I always try to keep that in mind. So there&rsquo;s usually a certain</p>
<p>kind of structure, like abstract introductions, methodology, depending on the community and so on.</p>
<p>Is there something about the process of how to read it, whether you want to skim it to try to</p>
<p>find the parts that are easy to understand or not, reading it multiple times? Is there any kind of</p>
<p>hacks that you can comment on? I remember like Feynman had this kind of hack when he was reading</p>
<p>papers, where you would basically, I think I believe you would read the conclusion of the</p>
<p>paper. And we would try to just see if he would be able to figure out how to get to the conclusion</p>
<p>in like a couple of minutes by himself. And he would read a lot of papers that way. And I think</p>
<p>Fermi also did that almost. And Fermi was known for doing a lot of back of the envelope calculation.</p>
<p>So he was a master at doing that. And in terms of like, especially when reading a paper, I think</p>
<p>a lot of times people might feel discouraged about the first time you read it. You know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard to grasp or you don&rsquo;t understand a huge fraction of the paper. And I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>having read a lot of papers in my life, I think I&rsquo;m in peace with like the fact that you might</p>
<p>spend hours where you&rsquo;re just reading a paper and jumping from paper to paper, reading citations.</p>
<p>And like your level of understanding sometimes of the paper is very close to 0%. And all of a</p>
<p>sudden, you know, everything kind of makes sense in your mind. And then, you know, you have this</p>
<p>quantum jump where all of a sudden you understand the big picture of the paper. And this is an</p>
<p>exercise that I have to do when reading papers and especially like more complex papers, like,</p>
<p>okay, you don&rsquo;t understand because you&rsquo;re just going through the process and just keep going.</p>
<p>And like, it might feel super chaotic, especially if you&rsquo;re jumping from reference to reference.</p>
<p>You know, you might end up with like 20 tabs open and you&rsquo;re reading a ton of other papers,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just trusting that process that at the end, like you&rsquo;ll find light. And I think for me,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good framework when reading a paper. It&rsquo;s hard because, you know, you might end up spending</p>
<p>a lot of time and it looks like you&rsquo;re lost, but that&rsquo;s the process to actually, you know,</p>
<p>understand what they&rsquo;re talking about in the paper.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that process, I enjoy, I&rsquo;ve found a lot of value in the process, especially for</p>
<p>things outside my field of reading a lot of related work sections and kind of going down</p>
<p>that path of getting a big context of the field. Because what&rsquo;s, especially when they&rsquo;re well</p>
<p>written, there&rsquo;s opinions injected into the really related work. Like what work is important,</p>
<p>what is not. And if you read multiple related work sections that cite or don&rsquo;t cite each other,</p>
<p>like the papers, you get a sense of where the field, where the tensions of the field are,</p>
<p>where the field is striving. And that helps you put into context, like whether the work is radical,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s overselling itself, whether it&rsquo;s underselling itself, all those things. And added</p>
<p>on top of that, I find that often the related work section is the most kind of accessible and</p>
<p>readable part of a paper because it&rsquo;s kind of, it&rsquo;s brief to the point, it&rsquo;s like summarizing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like a Wikipedia style article. The introduction is supposed to be a compelling story</p>
<p>or whatever, but it&rsquo;s often like overselling, there&rsquo;s like an agenda in the introduction.</p>
<p>The related work usually has the least amount of agenda except for the few like elements where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to talk shit about previous work where you&rsquo;re trying to sell that you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>much better. But other than that, when you&rsquo;re just painting where the field came from or where the</p>
<p>field stands, that&rsquo;s really valuable. And also again, just to agree with Fionn in the conclusion,</p>
<p>I get a lot of value from the breadth first search, kind of read the conclusion, then read</p>
<p>the related work, and then go through the references in the related work, read the conclusion,</p>
<p>read the related work, and just go down the tree until you like hit dead ends or run out of coffee.</p>
<p>And then through that process, you go back up the tree and now you can see the results in their</p>
<p>proper context, unless of course the paper is truly revolutionary, which even that process will help</p>
<p>you understand that is in fact truly revolutionary. You&rsquo;ve also, you talked about just following your</p>
<p>Twitter thread in depth first search. You talked about that you read the book on Grisha Perlman,</p>
<p>Grigori Perlman, and then you had a really nice Twitter thread on it and you were taking notes</p>
<p>throughout. So at a high level, is there suggestions you can give on how to take good notes?</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s we&rsquo;re talking about annotations or just for yourself to try to put on paper ideas</p>
<p>as you progress through the work in order to then like understand the work better.</p>
<p>For me, I always try not to underestimate how much you can forget within six months after</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve read something. I thought you were going to say five minutes, but yeah, six months is good.</p>
<p>Yeah, or even shorter. And so that&rsquo;s something that I always try to keep in mind. And it&rsquo;s often,</p>
<p>I mean, every once in a while I&rsquo;ll read back a paper that I annotated on Fermat and I&rsquo;ll read</p>
<p>through my own annotations and I&rsquo;ve completely forgotten what I had written. But it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>because in a way, after you just understood something, you&rsquo;re kind of the best possible</p>
<p>teacher that can teach your future self. After you&rsquo;ve forgotten it, you&rsquo;re kind of your own best</p>
<p>possible teacher at that moment. And so it can be great to try to capture that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s brilliant. It just made me kind of realize it&rsquo;s really nice to put yourself in the position</p>
<p>of teaching an older version of yourself that returns to this paper, almost like thinking literally.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s under explored, but it&rsquo;s super powerful because you were the person that you can,</p>
<p>if you look at the scale from one not knowing anything about the topic and 10,</p>
<p>you are the one that progressed from one to 10 and you know which steps you struggled with.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re really the best person to help yourself make that transition from one to 10.</p>
<p>And a lot of the times, I really believe that the framework that we have to expose ourselves to</p>
<p>be talking to us when we were an expert, when we were taking that class and we knew everything</p>
<p>about quantum mechanics. And then six months later, you don&rsquo;t remember half of the things.</p>
<p>How could we make it easier to have those conversations between you and your past</p>
<p>expert self? I think there might be, it&rsquo;s an under explored idea. I think notes on paper</p>
<p>are probably not the best way. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s a combination of video,</p>
<p>audio, where it&rsquo;s like you have a guided framework that you follow to extract information from</p>
<p>yourself so that you can later kind of revisit to make it easier to remember. But that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an interesting idea worth exploring that I haven&rsquo;t seen a lot of people kind of</p>
<p>trying to distill that problem.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m creating the kind of tools. I find if I record, it sounds weird, but I&rsquo;ll take notes,</p>
<p>but if I record audio, like little clips of thoughts, like rants, that&rsquo;s really effective</p>
<p>at capturing something that notes can&rsquo;t. Because when I replay them, for some reason,</p>
<p>it loads my brain back into where I was when I was reading that in a way that notes don&rsquo;t. Like</p>
<p>when I read notes, I&rsquo;ll often be like, what? What was I thinking there? But when I listened</p>
<p>to the audio, it brings you right back to that place. And maybe with video, with visual, that</p>
<p>might be even more powerful.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>And I think just the process of verbalizing it, that alone kind of makes you have to structure</p>
<p>your thought and put it in a way that somebody else could come and understand it. And just</p>
<p>the process of that is useful to organize your thoughts and yeah, just that alone.</p>
<p>Does the Fermat&rsquo;s Library Journal Club have a video component or no?</p>
<p>Not natively. We sometimes will include videos, but it&rsquo;s always embedded.</p>
<p>Do people build videos on top of it to explain the paper? Because you&rsquo;re doing all the hard work</p>
<p>of understanding deeply the paper.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t seen that happening too much. But we were actually playing around with the idea of</p>
<p>creating some sort of podcast version where we try to distill the paper on an audio format that</p>
<p>not maybe you can have access to.</p>
<p>Might be tricky.</p>
<p>Might be trickier, but there are definitely people that could be interested in the paper</p>
<p>and that topic, but are not willing to read it. But they might listen to a 30 minute episode</p>
<p>on that paper. You could reach more people and you might even bring the authors to the</p>
<p>conversation, but it&rsquo;s tricky. And especially for like more technical papers. We&rsquo;ve thought</p>
<p>about doing that, but we haven&rsquo;t converged. I&rsquo;m not sure if you have any tips.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m going to take that as a small project to take one of the Fermat&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>half advertisement and half as a challenge for myself to take one of the annotated papers and</p>
<p>use it as a basis for creating a quick video. I&rsquo;ve seen like, hopefully I&rsquo;m saying the name</p>
<p>correctly, but machine learning street talk. I think that&rsquo;s the name of the show that I</p>
<p>recommend highly. That&rsquo;s the right name. But they do exactly that, which is multiple hour</p>
<p>breakdown of a paper with video component. Sometimes with authors, people love it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very effective.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also, I&rsquo;ve seen, I haven&rsquo;t seen the entire, in its entirety, but I&rsquo;ve seen like the</p>
<p>founder of comma.ai, George. I&rsquo;ve seen him like just taking a paper and then, you know,</p>
<p>distilling the paper and coding it, coding it sometimes during 10 hours. And he was able to,</p>
<p>you know, get a lot of people interested in that and viewing him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of that. Like, George is a personality. I think a lot of people like</p>
<p>listen to this podcast for the same reason. It&rsquo;s not necessarily the contents. They like to listen</p>
<p>to like a silly Russian who has a childlike brain and mumbles and all those like struggle with</p>
<p>ideas, right? And George is a madman who people just enjoy. Like, how is he going to struggle</p>
<p>in implementing this particular paper? How is he going to struggle with this idea? It&rsquo;s fun to</p>
<p>watch and that actually pulls you in. The personality is important there.</p>
<p>True. But there&rsquo;s, you know, I agree with you, but there also, it&rsquo;s visible, like it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an extraordinary ability that is there. Like, he&rsquo;s talented and you need to have,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a craft and this guy definitely has talent and he&rsquo;s doing something that is not easy.</p>
<p>And I think that also draws the attention of people.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>And like the other day we were actually, we ran into this YouTube channel of this guy that was</p>
<p>restoring art, right? And it was basically just a video of him, like the production is really like</p>
<p>really well done. And it&rsquo;s just him taking really old pieces of art, like, and then paintings and</p>
<p>then restoring them. But he&rsquo;s really good at that. And he describes that process. And that draws</p>
<p>attention, draws the attention of people, regardless of your craft, be it like annotating a</p>
<p>paper or like restoring it.</p>
<p>Procurement, excellence. Yeah. Like George is incredibly good at programming.</p>
<p>Like quick, like, you know, those competitive programmers, like Topcoder and all those kinds of</p>
<p>stuff, he has the same kind of element where the brain just jumps around really quickly.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, yeah, just like, it&rsquo;s motivating, but you&rsquo;re right in watching people who are good at</p>
<p>what they do. It&rsquo;s motivating. Even if the thing you&rsquo;re trying to do is not what they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s contagious when they&rsquo;re really good at it. And the same kind of analysis with the paper,</p>
<p>I think, not just like the final result, but the process of struggling with it. That&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>interesting. Yeah. I think, I mean, I think Twitch proved that, like, you know, that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really a market for that, for watching people do things that they&rsquo;re really good at. And you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>just watch it. You will enjoy that. That might even spike your interest in that specific topic.</p>
<p>And yeah, and people will enjoy watching sometimes hours on end of great craftsmans.</p>
<p>Do you mind if we talk about some of the papers? Do any papers come to mind</p>
<p>that have been annotated on Fermat&rsquo;s library?</p>
<p>The papers that we annotated can be about completely random topics, but that&rsquo;s part of</p>
<p>what we enjoy as well. It forces you to explore these topics that otherwise maybe you&rsquo;d never</p>
<p>run into. And so the ones that come to mind are, to me, are fairly random. But one that I really</p>
<p>enjoyed learning more about is a paper written by a mathematician, actually, Thomas Postol,</p>
<p>and about a tunnel in a Greek island off the coast of Turkey. So it&rsquo;s very random.</p>
<p>Yeah. Okay, so what&rsquo;s interesting about this tunnel? So this tunnel was built in the sixth</p>
<p>century BC. And it was built in the island of Samos, which is, as I said, off the coast of Turkey.</p>
<p>And they had the city on one side, and they had a mountain, and then they had a bunch of</p>
<p>springs on the other side, and they wanted to bring water into the city. Building an aqueduct</p>
<p>would be pretty hard because of the way the mountain was shaped. And it would also, if they</p>
<p>were under a siege, they could just easily destroy that aqueduct, and then the water wouldn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>any water supply. The city wouldn&rsquo;t have any water supply. And so they decided to build a tunnel,</p>
<p>and they decided to try to do it quickly. And so they started digging from both ends</p>
<p>at the same time through the mountain. And so when you start thinking about this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fairly difficult problem. And this is like sixth century BC, so you had very limited access</p>
<p>to the mathematical tools that you had at the time, were very limited. And so what this paper</p>
<p>is about is about the story of how they built it and about the fact that for about 2000 years,</p>
<p>kind of the accepted explanation of how they built it was actually wrong. And so this tunnel</p>
<p>has been famous for a while. There are a number of historians that talked about it since ancient</p>
<p>Egypt. And the method that they described for building it was just wrong. And so these researchers</p>
<p>went there and were able to figure that out. And so basically, kind of the way that they thought</p>
<p>they had built it was basically, if you can imagine looking at the mountain from the top,</p>
<p>and you have the mountain and then you have both entrances. And so what they thought,</p>
<p>and this is what the ancient historians described, is that they effectively tried to draw a right</p>
<p>angle triangle with the two entrances at each end of the hypotenuse. And the way they did it is like</p>
<p>they would go around the mountain and kind of walking in a grid fashion. And then you can figure</p>
<p>out the two sides of the triangle. And then after you have that triangle, you can effectively draw</p>
<p>two smaller triangles at each entrance that are proportional to that big triangle. And then you</p>
<p>kind of have arrows pointing in each way. And then you know at least that you have a line going</p>
<p>through the mountain that connects both entrances. The issue with that is like once you go to this</p>
<p>mountain and you start thinking of doing this, you realize that especially given that the tools that</p>
<p>they had at the time, that your error margin would be too small. You wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do it.</p>
<p>Just the fact of trying to build this triangle in that fashion, the error would accumulate and you</p>
<p>would end up missing. You&rsquo;d start building these tunnels and they would miss each other. So the task</p>
<p>ultimately is to figure out like really perfectly as close as possible the direction you should be</p>
<p>digging. First of all that it&rsquo;s possible to have a straight line through and then what that the</p>
<p>direction would be. And then you are trying to infer that by constructing a right triangle</p>
<p>by doing. I&rsquo;m not exactly sure about how to do that rigorously like by tracing the mountain,</p>
<p>by walking along the mountain. You said grids? Yeah you kind of walk as if you were in a grid</p>
<p>and so you just walk in right angles. But then you have to walk really precisely then. Exactly.</p>
<p>You have to use tools to measure this and the terrain is probably a mess. So this makes more</p>
<p>sense in 2D and 3D gets even weirder. So okay gotcha. But so this method was described by like</p>
<p>an ancient Egyptian historian. I think hero of Alexandria. And then for about like yeah for</p>
<p>about 2000 years that&rsquo;s how we thought that they had built this tunnel. And then these</p>
<p>researchers went there and found out that actually they must have had to use other methods. And then</p>
<p>in this paper they describe these other methods and of course they can&rsquo;t know for sure. But</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s they present a bunch of plausible alternatives. The one that for me was is the</p>
<p>most plausible is that what they probably must have done is to use something that is similar to</p>
<p>an iron sight on a rifle. The way you can line up your rifle with a target off in the distance</p>
<p>by having an iron sight. And they must have done something similar to that</p>
<p>effectively with three sticks. And that way they were able to line up sticks along the side of the</p>
<p>mountain that were all on the same height. And so that then you could get to the other side</p>
<p>and you could and then you could draw that line. So this for me is the most plausible</p>
<p>way that they might have done that. But then they described this in detail and other possible</p>
<p>approaches in this paper. So this is a mathematician doing this? Yeah this is a mathematician that did</p>
<p>this. Which I suppose is the right mindset instead of skills required to solve an ancient problem</p>
<p>right? Yeah. Yeah. There&rsquo;s mathematicians and engineers a lot of things. Because they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have computers or drones or lidar back then or whatever technology you would use modern day for</p>
<p>the civil engineering. Yeah. Another fascinating thing is that like you know after effectively</p>
<p>after the the downfall of the Roman civilization people didn&rsquo;t build tunnels for about a thousand</p>
<p>years. We go a thousand years without tunnels and then like only in like in late middle ages that</p>
<p>we start doing them again. But here is the tunnel like sixth century BC like incredibly limited</p>
<p>mathematics and they and they build it in this way. And it was a mystery for a long time exactly</p>
<p>how they did it. And then these mathematicians went there and basically with no archaeology</p>
<p>kind of background were able to figure it out. How do annotations for this paper look like? What is</p>
<p>it what&rsquo;s a successful annotation for paper like this? Yeah so sometimes you&rsquo;re for this paper</p>
<p>sometimes adding some more context on on a specific part like sometimes they they mentioned</p>
<p>for instance these instruments that were common in ancient Greece and ancient Rome for for building</p>
<p>things. And and and so in some of those annotations I describe these instruments in more detail and</p>
<p>how they worked because sometimes it can be hard to to visualize these.</p>
<p>Then this paper I forget exactly when when this was published I believe maybe maybe the 70s.</p>
<p>And then there was further research into this tunnel and more interesting other interesting</p>
<p>aspects about it. I add those to that paper as well. There&rsquo;s historical context that I also go</p>
<p>into there for instance the fact that as a as I said that effectively after the downfall of the</p>
<p>Roman Empire no tunnels were built like this something that I that I go that I that I added</p>
<p>to the paper as well. Yeah so so when other people look at the paper how do they usually consume the</p>
<p>annotations? So they it&rsquo;s like is there a commenting feature is the I mean like this is a really</p>
<p>enriching experience the way you read a paper. What what aspects do you do people usually talk</p>
<p>about that they they value from this? So yeah so anybody can just go on there and and either add</p>
<p>a new annotation or add a comment to an existing annotation and so you can start a kind of a thread</p>
<p>within an existing annotation. And that&rsquo;s something that happens relative frequency and then</p>
<p>because I was the original author of the initial annotation I get pinged and so oftentimes I&rsquo;ll go</p>
<p>back and and and add on to to that thread. How&rsquo;d you pick the paper? I mean first of all this whole</p>
<p>process is really exciting. I&rsquo;m gonna especially after this conversation I&rsquo;m gonna make sure I</p>
<p>participate much more actively on papers that I know a lot about and on paper I know nothing about.</p>
<p>I should both of us annotate the paper. I would love to. I also I mean I realized that uh there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s an opportunity for people like me to publicly annotate a paper. Or do an AMA around</p>
<p>the paper. Yeah exactly but yeah but like be um be in the conversation about a paper. It&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>place to have a conversation about an idea. You get the other way to do it that&rsquo;s much more ad hoc</p>
<p>is on Twitter right? But this is more like formal and you don&rsquo;t have to be in the conversation</p>
<p>on Twitter right? But this is more like formal and you could actually probably integrate the two.</p>
<p>You have a conversation about the conversation. So the Twitter is the conversation about a</p>
<p>conversation and the main conversation is in this space of annotations. There&rsquo;s an interesting effect</p>
<p>that we we see sometimes with the annotations on our papers is that a lot of people especially if</p>
<p>we the annotations are really well done people sometimes are afraid of adding more annotations</p>
<p>because they see that as a kind of a finished work. Yes. And so they they don&rsquo;t want to pollute</p>
<p>that or uh and especially if it&rsquo;s like a silly question. This is I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s good. I</p>
<p>think you know we should as much as possible try to lower the barrier for someone to jump in and</p>
<p>ask questions. I think it only like most of the times it adds value but it&rsquo;s some feedback that</p>
<p>we got from users and and readers. I&rsquo;m not exactly sure how to to kind of fight that but um. Well I</p>
<p>think I think if I serve as an inspiration in any way is by asking a lot of dumb questions and saying</p>
<p>a bunch of dumb shit all the time and hopefully that inspires the rest of the other folks to do</p>
<p>the same because that&rsquo;s the only way to knowledge I think is to be willing to ask the dumb questions.</p>
<p>And there are papers that are like um you know we have a lot of papers on Fermat&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>one page or really short papers and you we have like the shortest paper ever published in a math</p>
<p>journal like with like just a couple of words. Yeah. One of my favorite papers on the platform</p>
<p>is actually a paper um written by Enrico Fermi. Yeah. And the title of the paper is my obs I think</p>
<p>is my observations at Trinity. So basically Fermi was part of the Manhattan Project. So he was in</p>
<p>New Mexico when they exploded the first atomic bomb and so he was a couple of miles away from</p>
<p>the explosion and he was probably one of the first persons to calculate the energy of the explosion.</p>
<p>And so the way he did that was he took a piece of paper and he tore down a piece of paper in in</p>
<p>little pieces and when the bomb exploded the Trinity bomb was the name of the bomb like he</p>
<p>waited for the blast to arrive at where he was and then he threw those pieces of paper in the air</p>
<p>and he calculated the energy based on the displacement of the paper the pieces of paper</p>
<p>and then he wrote a report which was classified until like a couple of years ago one page report</p>
<p>like calculating the energy of the explosion. Oh that&rsquo;s so badass. And I we actually went there</p>
<p>and kind of unpacked and like I think he just mentions basically the energy and we we actually</p>
<p>went and one of the annotations is like explaining how he did that. I wonder how accurate he was.</p>
<p>It was maybe I think like 20 or 25 percent off. Then there was another person that actually</p>
<p>calculated the energy based on images after the explosion at the rate and the rate at which the</p>
<p>like the mushroom of the explosion expanded and it&rsquo;s more accurate to calculate the energy based</p>
<p>on that and I think it was like 20 20 percent off but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s really interesting because you know</p>
<p>Fermi was known for all these being a master at these back of the envelope calculations always</p>
<p>like the the Fermi problems are well known for for that and it&rsquo;s super interesting to see like</p>
<p>that just one page report that was also actually classified and it&rsquo;s interesting because a couple</p>
<p>months ago when the Beirut explosion happened there was a video circulating of these a bride</p>
<p>that was doing a photo shoot when the explosion in Beirut happened and so you can see a video of</p>
<p>her with the wedding dress and then the explosion happens in the blast arrives at where she was she</p>
<p>was a couple of miles away from the last and you can see like the displacement of the dress as well</p>
<p>and I actually looked and that video went viral on Twitter and I actually looked at that video</p>
<p>and based I used the same techniques that Fermi used to calculate the energy of the explosion</p>
<p>based on the displacement of the dress and you could actually see where where she was at the</p>
<p>the distance from the explosion because there was a store behind her and you could look the name of</p>
<p>the store and and so I calculated that it was the distance and then you can the based on the</p>
<p>distance where she was from the the explosion and also on the the displacement of the dress</p>
<p>like because you can when the blast happens like you can see the dress going back and then going</p>
<p>back to the original position and like by just looking at like how much the the dress moved you</p>
<p>can estimate the explode the energy of the explosion I assume you published this on Twitter</p>
<p>was just a Twitter thread but it actually like a lot of people share that and it was picked up by</p>
<p>a couple of news outlets but I was hoping it would be like a formal title and it would be an archive</p>
<p>no no no it may be submitted just the Twitter thread but it was interesting because it was</p>
<p>exactly the same method that Fermi used is there something else that jumps to mind like what is</p>
<p>there something um I know like in terms of papers like I know the Bitcoin paper is super popular</p>
<p>is there something interesting to be said about any of the white papers in the cryptocurrency space</p>
<p>yeah the the the Bitcoin paper was the first paper that we put on for months and uh why that</p>
<p>why that choice as the first paper it was a while ago and it was one of the papers that I read</p>
<p>and then uh and then kind of explained it to to louise and or to other friends that do this</p>
<p>journal club with us and um I did some research in cryptography uh as an undergrad and so it was a</p>
<p>topic that I was interested in um but even for me that I I had that background but reading the</p>
<p>Bitcoin paper it took me a few reads to really kind of wrap my head around it it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it uses very spartan precise language in a way it&rsquo;s like you feel like you can&rsquo;t take any</p>
<p>word out of it without something falling apart and uh and it&rsquo;s all there I think it&rsquo;s a beautiful</p>
<p>paper and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s very well written of course but um you know we wanted to try to make</p>
<p>it accessible so that anybody that maybe is an undergrad in computer science could go on there</p>
<p>and then and and know that you have all the information in in that page that you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to need to understand the mechanics of Bitcoin and so like I explain you know the basic</p>
<p>public key cryptography that you need to to know in order to understand it like explain</p>
<p>okay what are the properties of a hash function and how they are useful in this context</p>
<p>um explain what a merkle tree is so a bunch of those basic concepts that maybe if you&rsquo;re reading</p>
<p>it for a first time and you&rsquo;re an undergrad and you know you don&rsquo;t know those terms you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to be you know discouraged because maybe okay now I have to go and google around until I understand</p>
<p>these before I can make progress in the paper um and and this way it&rsquo;s all there you know so so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a magic to also to the fact that over time more people went on there and and added further</p>
<p>annotations so the the idea that the paper gets easier and more accessible over time but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still you&rsquo;re still looking at the original content the way the the author intended it to be uh but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just more context and the toughest bits have have more in depth explanations okay I think</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a just so many interesting papers uh there like I remember reading the paper that was</p>
<p>written by Freeman Dyson on the like the the first time that he explained he came up with</p>
<p>the concept of the Dyson sphere and he he put that out like it&rsquo;s again it&rsquo;s a one page paper</p>
<p>um and he what he explained was that eventually if a civilization develops and and grows there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be a point where when the resources on the planet are not are not enough for the energy</p>
<p>requirements of that civilization so if you want to go the next step is you need to go to the next</p>
<p>star and extract energy from that star and the way to do it is you need to build some sort of cap</p>
<p>around the star that extracts the energy so he theorized this idea of the the Dyson sphere</p>
<p>and he went on to kind of analyze how you would build that the stability of that sphere like</p>
<p>if something happens if there&rsquo;s like a small oscillation with that fear collapse into the</p>
<p>star or know what what would happen and even went on to kind of say that a good way for us to look</p>
<p>for signs of intelligent life out there is to look for signals of these Dyson spheres and because you</p>
<p>know according to the law of second law of thermodynamics like there&rsquo;s going to be some a</p>
<p>lot of infrared radiation that is going to be emitted as a consequence of extracting energy</p>
<p>from the star and we should be able to see those signals of like infrared if we look at the sky</p>
<p>but all these like from the introduction of the concept like the how to build the Dyson sphere</p>
<p>the problems of like having a Dyson sphere how to detect how that could be used as a signal for</p>
<p>intelligence life really that&rsquo;s all in the paper all in one like one page paper and it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s for me it&rsquo;s beautiful it&rsquo;s like where was this published i don&rsquo;t remember it&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>that papers like that could be yeah i mean the guts it takes to put that all together in a paper</p>
<p>before you know that that kind of challenges our previous discussion that of paper i mean papers</p>
<p>can be beautiful you can play with the format right it but there&rsquo;s a lot to unpack there that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like the the that&rsquo;s the the starting point but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s beautiful that you&rsquo;re able to put that</p>
<p>in one page and then people can build on top of that and but the key ideas are there yeah exactly</p>
<p>what about have you looked at any of the the big seminal papers throughout the history of</p>
<p>science like you look at simple like einstein papers have any of those been annotated yeah</p>
<p>yeah no we we have some more seminal papers that that people have heard about um you know we have</p>
<p>the the DNA double elix paper on there we have the Higgs boson uh paper um yeah there&rsquo;s papers</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ll that we know that it&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re not going to be finding out about them because of us</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s papers that we think um should be more widely read and that folks would benefit from</p>
<p>having some annotations there and so we also have a number of those a lot of like discovery papers</p>
<p>for fundamental like particles and all that there&rsquo;s we have a lot of those on from us library</p>
<p>um yeah we i would like to end we haven&rsquo;t annotated that one but i&rsquo;d like to on the</p>
<p>Riemann hypothesis that&rsquo;s a really interesting paper as well um and and but we haven&rsquo;t annotated</p>
<p>that one but there&rsquo;s a lot of like more historical landmark papers um on the platform have you done</p>
<p>uh Poincare conjecture with uh with Perlman that&rsquo;s too much that&rsquo;s too much that&rsquo;s too much</p>
<p>too much for me but it&rsquo;s uh it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s interesting that you know and going back to our discussion</p>
<p>like the the Poincare paper was like published on archive and and it was not on a journal like</p>
<p>the three papers and yeah what do you make of that i mean he&rsquo;s such a fascinating human being</p>
<p>exactly i mentioned to you offline that i&rsquo;m going to russia he&rsquo;s somebody i&rsquo;m really uh to interview</p>
<p>yeah i well i so i definitely will interview him i um and i believe i will i believe i can i just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know how to i know where he lives so here okay my my uh my hope is my conjecture is that</p>
<p>if i just show up to the house and look desperate enough uh that uh or threatening enough for some</p>
<p>combination of both that like the only way to get rid of me is to just get the thing done that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>hope it&rsquo;s actually interesting that you mentioned that because i after i um so a couple of weeks ago</p>
<p>i was searching for like stuff about Perlman Perlman online ended up on this twitter account</p>
<p>of like this guy that claims to be Perlman Perlman&rsquo;s assistant and he&rsquo;s like he has been</p>
<p>posting a bunch of pictures like next to Perlman you can see like Perlman in in a library and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like next to him like taking a selfie or like Perlman walking on the street and like maybe you</p>
<p>could reach out to his assistant then i&rsquo;ll send you i&rsquo;ll send you this twitter account so maybe</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re onto something no but but going going back to like Perlman is super interesting because the</p>
<p>fact that he published the the the the proofs on archive is what was also like a way for him to</p>
<p>because he really didn&rsquo;t like the scientific publishing industry and the fact that you had to</p>
<p>pay to get uh access to to articles and that was a form of like protest and that&rsquo;s why he published</p>
<p>um those papers there i mean i i think Perlman is just a fascinating like character and for me</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s this kind of ideal of a platonic ideal of what a mathematician should be you know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>someone that is you know it&rsquo;s just cares about deeply cares about mathematics you know it cares</p>
<p>about fair attribution of of um disregards money and um and and like the fact that he published</p>
<p>like on archive was is a good example of what about the Fields Medal that he turned down the</p>
<p>Fields Medal what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s yeah what do you make of that yeah i mean if you look at like the reasons</p>
<p>why he rejected the Fields Medal so after so Perlman did a postdoc in the US and when he came</p>
<p>back to Russia um do you know how good his English is i think it&rsquo;s very fairly good it&rsquo;s pretty good</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s really good especially given lectures yeah but i haven&rsquo;t been able to listen to anything</p>
<p>well certainly not listen but i haven&rsquo;t been able to get anybody because i know a lot of people have</p>
<p>been to those lectures i&rsquo;m not able to get a sense of like yeah but how strong is the accent what are</p>
<p>we talking about here is this going to have to be in Russian it&rsquo;s going to have to be in English</p>
<p>is fascinating but he writes the papers in English so true like there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s but there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s such a fascinating character and um there are a couple of examples like him like at</p>
<p>i think 28 or 29 he proved like a really famous uh conjecture called the soul conjecture i believe</p>
<p>it was like in a very short four page proof of that was a really big breakthrough then he went</p>
<p>to Princeton to give a lecture on that and after the lecture uh the the chair of the math department</p>
<p>at Princeton a guy called Peter Sarnak went up to to Perelman was trying to recruit him</p>
<p>trying to offer him a position at Princeton and he was and at some point he asked for Perelman&rsquo;s</p>
<p>resume and Perelman responded saying just gave a lecture on like this really tough problem why do</p>
<p>you need my resume like i&rsquo;m not gonna send you like i just proved like my value uh but uh but</p>
<p>going back to the Fields Medal like when when Perelman went to back to Russia he arrived at a</p>
<p>time where the the salary of postdocs were so much off in regards to inflation that they were not</p>
<p>making any money like the the people didn&rsquo;t even bother to pick up the checks at the end of the</p>
<p>month because they were just like ridiculous but thankfully he had some money that he had</p>
<p>uh gained while he was doing this postdoc so he just concentrated on like the Poincare the the</p>
<p>Poincare conjecture problem which he when he when he took that um he took it after uh it was</p>
<p>reframed by this uh mathematician called Richard Hamilton which posed the problem in a way that</p>
<p>it turned into this super like math Olympiad problem with like perfect boundaries well defined</p>
<p>and that was perfect for Perelman to attack and so he spent like seven years working on that and</p>
<p>then in 2002 he started publishing those papers on archive and people started jumping on that</p>
<p>reading those papers and there was like a lot of excitement around that a couple of years later</p>
<p>there were two researchers i believe it was they were from Harvard that took Perelman&rsquo;s Perelman&rsquo;s</p>
<p>work they sanded some of the edges and they republished that saying that you know based on</p>
<p>Perelman&rsquo;s work they were able to figure out the the Poincare conjecture and then there was um</p>
<p>at the time at the the international um conference of mathematics in 2000 2006 i believe that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>they were going to give out the Fields Medal there was a lot of debate like oh who&rsquo;s who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like we should get the credit for solving this big problem and for Perelman it like it it felt</p>
<p>really sad that people were even considering that he was not the person that solved that</p>
<p>and and the claims that those like researchers when they published after Perelman they were</p>
<p>false claims that they were the ones they just sanded a couple of edges like Perelman did all</p>
<p>the really hard work and so just just the fact that they doubted that Perelman had done that</p>
<p>like was enough for him to say i&rsquo;m not i&rsquo;m not interested in this prize and that was one of the</p>
<p>reasons why he rejected the Fields Medal then he also rejected the clay prize so the Poincare</p>
<p>conjecture was one of the millennium prizes there was a million dollar prize associated with that</p>
<p>problem and that has to add to do with the fact that for them to attribute that prize i think it</p>
<p>had to be published on a journal yes the proof and again Perelman&rsquo;s principles of like interfered</p>
<p>here and and he also just didn&rsquo;t care about the money he was like um clay i think was a businessman</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like doesn&rsquo;t have to do anything with with mathematics i don&rsquo;t care about these like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why he rejected it yeah there&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s hard to convert into words but</p>
<p>at MIT i&rsquo;m distinctly aware of the distinction between when i enter a room there&rsquo;s a certain</p>
<p>kind of music to the way people talk when we&rsquo;re talking about ideas versus what that music sounds</p>
<p>like when we&rsquo;re talking when it&rsquo;s like bickering in the space of like whether it&rsquo;s politics or</p>
<p>funding or egos it&rsquo;s a different sound to it and i&rsquo;m distinctly aware of the two and i kind of</p>
<p>sort of to me personally happiness was just like swimming around the one that like is the political</p>
<p>stuff or the money stuff and all that or egos and i think that&rsquo;s probably what problem is as well</p>
<p>like the moment he senses there&rsquo;s any as what it feels metal like the moment you start to have any</p>
<p>kind of drama around credit assignment all those kinds of things it&rsquo;s almost not that it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>who gets the credit it&rsquo;s like the drama in itself gets in the way of the exploration of the ideas</p>
<p>or the fundamental thing that makes science so damn beautiful and and you can really see that</p>
<p>is also a product of that russian school of like doing science and you can see that that um that</p>
<p>people were you know during the cold war a lot of mathematicians they were not making any money they</p>
<p>were doing math for the sake of math like for the intellectual pleasure of like solving a difficult</p>
<p>problem yeah and you know even even if it was a flawed system and there were a lot of problems with</p>
<p>with that there&rsquo;s these they were able to to actually achieve these and there were a lot of</p>
<p>and perelman for me is the perfect product of that he just cared about like working on tough problems</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t care about anything else it was just math you know pure math yeah there&rsquo;s a like for</p>
<p>the broader audience i think another example of that is like professional sports versus olympics</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve especially in russia i&rsquo;ve seen that clear distinction where because the state manages</p>
<p>so much of the olympic process in russia as people know with the steroids yes yes yes but outside</p>
<p>of steroids thing uh is like the athlete can focus on the pure artistry of the sport like</p>
<p>like not worry about the money not just in the way they talk about it the way they think about it the</p>
<p>way they define excellence versus like in the perhaps a bit of a capitalist system in united</p>
<p>states with american football with baseball basketball so much of the discussion is about</p>
<p>money now of course at the end of the day it&rsquo;s about excellence and artistry and all that but</p>
<p>when the culture is so richly grounded in discussions of money and</p>
<p>uh sort of this capitalistic like uh merch and uh businesses and all those kinds of things</p>
<p>it changes the nature of the activity and it&rsquo;s in a way that&rsquo;s hard again to describe in words but</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s purely about the activity itself it&rsquo;s almost like you quiet down all the noise</p>
<p>enough to hear the signal enough to hear the beauty like whenever you&rsquo;re talking about the</p>
<p>like whenever you&rsquo;re talking about the money that&rsquo;s when the marketing people come and the</p>
<p>business people the non creatives come and they fill the room and there&rsquo;s and they create drama</p>
<p>and they know how to create the drama and the noise as opposed to the people who are truly</p>
<p>excellent at what they do the the person in their arena right like when you remove all the money</p>
<p>and you just let that thing shine that&rsquo;s when true excellence can and can come out and that was</p>
<p>one of the few things that worked with the communist system in the Soviet Union to me at</p>
<p>least as somebody who loves sport and loves mathematics and uh science that worked well</p>
<p>removing the money from the picture uh you know not that I&rsquo;m um not that I&rsquo;m saying poverty is</p>
<p>good for science there&rsquo;s some level in which not worrying about money is good for science it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>weird I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what to make of that because capitalism works really damn well yeah but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s um it&rsquo;s tricky how to find that balance one field&rsquo;s medalist that is interesting to look at</p>
<p>and I think you mentioned it earlier but it&rsquo;s C√©dric Villani which is might be the only uh</p>
<p>field&rsquo;s medalist that is also a politician now but so it&rsquo;s this it&rsquo;s this brilliant French</p>
<p>mathematician that won the field&rsquo;s medal and and after that he decided that one of the ways that</p>
<p>he could have could have uh you know the biggest leverage kind of is in pushing science in the</p>
<p>direction that he thinks science should go would be to to try to go into politics and so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what he did and and uh and he has ran I&rsquo;m not sure if he has won any election but I think he&rsquo;s running</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s running for mayor for mayor of Paris or something like that but it&rsquo;s this brilliant</p>
<p>mathematician that uh that uh before winning the field&rsquo;s medal had only been just a brilliant</p>
<p>mathematician but but after that he decided to go into politics to to try to to have an impact and</p>
<p>try to change some of the things that he he would complain about um before so so there&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>component as well yeah and I&rsquo;ve always thought mathematics and science should be like like James</p>
<p>Bond would in my eyes I think be sexier if he did math like we should as a society put</p>
<p>excellence in mathematics at the same level as being able to kill a man with your bare hands</p>
<p>like those are both useful features like that&rsquo;s admirable it&rsquo;s like oh like that makes you like</p>
<p>that makes the person interesting like being extremely well read about history or philosophy</p>
<p>being good at mathematics being able to kill a man with bare hands these are all the same in my book</p>
<p>so I think all are useful for action stars uh and I think the society will benefit for uh for giving</p>
<p>more value to that like one of the things that bothers me about American culture is the I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know the right words to use but like the nerdiness associated with science like like in I I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think nerd is a good word in in American culture because uh it&rsquo;s seen as like weakness there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>images that come with that and it&rsquo;s fine you could you could be all kinds of shapes and colors and</p>
<p>personalities but like to me uh having sophisticated knowledge in science being good at math</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re weak in fact it could be the very opposite and so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>interesting thing because it was very much differently viewed in the uh in the Soviet Union</p>
<p>so I know for sure as an existence proof that uh it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way but it um</p>
<p>I also feel like we lack a lot of role models in terms if you ask people are mentioned to mention</p>
<p>one mathematician that they know that is alive today I think a lot of people would struggle</p>
<p>to answer that question um and I also think I love Neil deGrasse Tyson okay but there is uh</p>
<p>having more role models is good like different kinds of personalities he he has kind of fun and</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very it&rsquo;s uh like Bill Nye the science guy I don&rsquo;t know if you guys know him so like that</p>
<p>spectrum that yeah but there there&rsquo;s not like Feynman is no longer there uh those kinds of</p>
<p>personality Carl Sagan even Carl Sagan yeah like a seriousness that&rsquo;s like not playful like not</p>
<p>apologetical yeah exactly not apologetic about being knowledgeable like like in fact like the</p>
<p>kind of energy where you feel uh self conscious about not having thought about some of these</p>
<p>questions right just like when I see James Bond I feel bad about that I don&rsquo;t have never killed a</p>
<p>man like I need to make sure I fix that that&rsquo;s the way I feel the same way I want to feel like</p>
<p>that way well Carl Sagan talks I I feel like I need to have that same kind of seriousness about</p>
<p>science like if I don&rsquo;t know something I want to I want to know well what about Terrence Tao</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s kind of a superstar what are your thoughts about him true it&rsquo;s probably one of the most</p>
<p>famous mathematicians alive today and probably one of I mean regardless of like is of course</p>
<p>he won a field the Fields Medal is really smart and talented mathematician um it&rsquo;s also like a</p>
<p>big inspiration for us um at least for some of the work that we do with Fermat&rsquo;s library</p>
<p>so Terrence Tao is is known for having you know a big blog and he&rsquo;s pretty open about</p>
<p>um like his research and he also he tries to make his work as public as possible um through his blog</p>
<p>posts um in fact there&rsquo;s a really interesting um problem that got solved a couple of years ago</p>
<p>so Tao was working with uh on a problem on an Erdos problem actually so Paul Erdos was this</p>
<p>mathematician from Hungary and he was known for like um the Erdos for a lot of things but one of</p>
<p>the things that he was also known was for the Erdos problem so he was always like um creating</p>
<p>these problems and usually associating prizes with those problems and a lot of those problems</p>
<p>are still open like and and there will be some of them will be open for like maybe</p>
<p>a couple hundred years and I think that&rsquo;s actually an interesting hack for him to collaborate with</p>
<p>future mathematicians you know his his name will keep coming up and you know for future generations</p>
<p>but so Tao was working on one of these problems called the Erdos discrepancy and he published a</p>
<p>blog post on like uh about that problem about that problem and he reached like a dead end and then um</p>
<p>all of a sudden there was this guy from from Germany that wrote like a comment on his blog post</p>
<p>saying okay like some of the that so this problem is like a Sudoku like flavor and some of the</p>
<p>machinery that we&rsquo;re using to solve Sudoku could be used here and that was actually the key to</p>
<p>solve the Erdos discrepancy problem so the there was a comment on his blog and I think that that</p>
<p>that for me is an example of like how to do again going back to collaborative science online um and</p>
<p>the power that it has but Tao is also like pretty public about like some of the struggles and of</p>
<p>of being a a mathematician like and and even he wrote about some of the unintended consequences</p>
<p>of having extraordinary ability in a field and he used himself as an example when he was growing up</p>
<p>he was extremely talented in in mathematics from a young age like Tao was a person he won an</p>
<p>uh medal in like one of the IMOs at the age I think was a gold medal at the age of 10 or something</p>
<p>like that and so he mentioned that when he was growing up like and especially in college when he</p>
<p>was in a class that he enjoyed it didn&rsquo;t it just came very natural for him and he didn&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>work hard to just ace the class and when he found that the class was boring like it didn&rsquo;t work and</p>
<p>he barely passed barely passed even some I think in college he almost failed two classes and and</p>
<p>he was talking about that and how he brought those studying habits or like uh in existence of studying</p>
<p>habits when he went to Princeton Princeton for his PhD and in Princeton when he you know started kind</p>
<p>of um delving into more complex problems and classes he struggled a lot because he didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>that uh those those habits like he wasn&rsquo;t taking notes and he was he wasn&rsquo;t studying hard when he</p>
<p>when he faced problems and he almost failed out of his his PhD uh he almost failed his PhD exam</p>
<p>and um it it talks about like having this conversation with with his advisor and the</p>
<p>advisor pointing out like you&rsquo;re not this is not working you you might have to get out of the</p>
<p>program and like how that was a kind of a turning point for him and um he was like you know he was</p>
<p>um and like it was super important in his career so I think Tao is also like this figure that apart</p>
<p>from being just an exceptional mathematician he&rsquo;s also pretty open about you know what what it takes</p>
<p>to to to be a mathematician and some of the struggles of this type of careers and and I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s super important in many ways he&rsquo;s a contributor to open science and open humanity</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s being an open human true by communicating uh Scott Aaronson is another in computer science</p>
<p>world who&rsquo;s a very different style very different style but there&rsquo;s something about a blog that</p>
<p>is authentic and real and just gives us a window into the into the mind and soul of of of these</p>
<p>brilliant folks so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s definitely a gift let me ask you about Fermat&rsquo;s library on twitter</p>
<p>which uh I mean I don&rsquo;t know how to describe it people should definitely just follow Fermat&rsquo;s</p>
<p>library on twitter I keep following and unfollowing from his library because because uh it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>it it gives when I follow it um leads me on down rabbit holes often that um that um that are very</p>
<p>fruitful but but anyway so the the posts you do with the on twitter are just these beautiful</p>
<p>are things that reveal some beautiful aspect of mathematics um is there um is there something you</p>
<p>could say about the approach there yeah and um maybe maybe broadly what you find beautiful about</p>
<p>mathematics and then more specifically how you convert that into a rigorous process of revealing</p>
<p>that in tweet form that&rsquo;s a good point I think there&rsquo;s something about math that you know a lot</p>
<p>you know a lot of the mathematical content and you know papers or like little proofs um you know</p>
<p>has in a way sort of an infinite half life what I mean by that is that if you look at like Euclid&rsquo;s</p>
<p>elements it&rsquo;s as valid today as it was when it was created like 2000 years ago and that&rsquo;s not true</p>
<p>for a lot of other scientific fields um and so in regards to twitter I think there&rsquo;s also a very</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very under under explored platform from a learning perspective I think if you look at</p>
<p>content on twitter it&rsquo;s very easy to consume it&rsquo;s very easy to read um and especially when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to explain something you know we humans get a dopamine hit if we learn something new</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a very very powerful feeling and that&rsquo;s why you know people go to classes when</p>
<p>you have a really good professor you know it&rsquo;s looking for those dopamine hits and</p>
<p>and and that&rsquo;s something that we try to explore when we&rsquo;re producing content on twitter imagine</p>
<p>if we could if you would on a line to a restaurant you could go go to your phone to learn something</p>
<p>new instead of social going to a you know social network and to just and so and I think it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>hard to to sometimes to kind of provide that feeling because you need to sometimes digest</p>
<p>content and and put it um in a way you know that it feeds 280 characters um and and it requires a</p>
<p>lot of sometimes time to do that uh even though it&rsquo;s easy to consume it&rsquo;s hard to make but once</p>
<p>you are able to to provide that eureka moment to people like that&rsquo;s very powerful they get that</p>
<p>dopamine hit and like you create this feedback cycle and people come back for for more and in</p>
<p>twitter compared to like you know an online course for a book you have a zero percent dropout so</p>
<p>people will read the content the content so that it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s part of the creators like the</p>
<p>person that is creating the content if you&rsquo;re able to actually get that feedback cycle it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>super super powerful yeah but some of the stuff is like like how the heck do you find that and</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s so appealing it uh like uh this is from uh what is it</p>
<p>a couple days ago i&rsquo;ll just read out the number 23456789 is the largest prime number with</p>
<p>consecutive increasing digits i mean that is so cool that&rsquo;s like some weird like glimpse</p>
<p>into some deep universal truth even though it&rsquo;s just a number i mean that&rsquo;s like so arbitrary</p>
<p>like why why is it so pleasant that that&rsquo;s a thing but it is in some way it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>it is a little glimpse at some much bigger like um and and i think like especially if we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about science there&rsquo;s something unique about you go and with a lot of the tweets you go sometimes</p>
<p>from a state of not knowing something to knowing something and that is very particular to science</p>
<p>math physics and that again is extra extremely addictive and that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s how i i i i feel about</p>
<p>that and um that&rsquo;s why i think people engage so much with with our tweets and go into rabbit holes</p>
<p>and then they you know we start with prime numbers and all of a sudden you are spending hours reading</p>
<p>number theory things and you go into wikipedia and you lose a lot of time there but uh well the</p>
<p>variety is really interesting too there&rsquo;s human things there&rsquo;s uh there&rsquo;s physics things there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like numeric things like i just mentioned but there&rsquo;s also more rigorous mathematical things</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s stuff that&rsquo;s tied to the history of math and the proofs and there&rsquo;s visual there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>animations uh there are looping animations that are incredible that reveal something</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s uh andrew wiles on being smart this is just me now like ignoring you guys is just going</p>
<p>through yeah we&rsquo;re a bit like math drug dealers we&rsquo;re just trying to get you hooked we&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to give you that hit and trying to get you hooked yes some people are brighter than others but i</p>
<p>really believe that most people can really get to to quite a good level of mathematics if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>prepared to deal with these psychological issues of how to handle the situation of being stuck</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s some truth to that that&rsquo;s truth i feel that&rsquo;s like really it&rsquo;s some truth in terms</p>
<p>of research and also about startups you&rsquo;re stuck a lot of the time before you you get to a</p>
<p>breakthrough and and it&rsquo;s difficult to endure that process of like being stuck and because you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>trained to to be in that position um i feel uh yeah that&rsquo;s yeah most people are broken by the</p>
<p>stuckness or like their district like uh i i&rsquo;ve i&rsquo;ve been very cognizant of the fact that</p>
<p>more and more social media becomes a thing like distractions become a thing that that moment of</p>
<p>being stuck is uh your mind wants to to go do stuff that&rsquo;s unrelated to being stuck and you</p>
<p>should be stuck i&rsquo;m referring to small stucknesses like you&rsquo;re like trying to design something and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a dead end basically little dead ends dead ends of programming dead ends and trying to think</p>
<p>through something and then your mind wants to like like like uh this is the problem this like</p>
<p>work life balance culture is like take a break like as if taking a break will solve everything</p>
<p>sometimes it solves quite a bit but like sometimes you need to sit in the stuckness and suffer a</p>
<p>little bit and then take a break but you you definitely need to be this and like most people</p>
<p>quit from that psychological battle being stuck so success is people who who who uh persevere</p>
<p>through that yeah yeah and and in the creative process that&rsquo;s also true i was the other day i</p>
<p>was i think was reading about is this um what is his name ed sheeran like the musician yeah was</p>
<p>talking a little bit about the creative process and using was using this analogy of a faucet like</p>
<p>where you when you turn on a faucet is as like the dirty water coming out in the beginning and you</p>
<p>just have to you know keep trusting that at some point your clean clean clear water will come out</p>
<p>but you have to endure that process like in the beginning it&rsquo;s going to be dirty water and and and</p>
<p>just you know embrace that yeah actually this uh the entirety of my youtube channel and this</p>
<p>podcast have been following that philosophy of dirty water like i&rsquo;ve been you know i do believe</p>
<p>that like you have to get all the crap out of your system first and uh sometimes it it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s all crappy work i tend to be very self critical but i do think that quantity leads</p>
<p>to quality for some people it does for my the way my mind works is like just keep putting stuff out</p>
<p>there keep creating and uh the quality will come as opposed to sitting there waiting not doing</p>
<p>anything until the thing seems perfect because the perfect may never come but just just on like on</p>
<p>on on our twitter like profile i really and sometimes when you look on some of those tweets</p>
<p>they might seem like pretty kind of um you know why is this interesting it&rsquo;s like so raw uh like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a number but i really believe that especially with math or physics it is possible</p>
<p>to get everyone to love math or physics even if you think you hate it it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not a function of</p>
<p>the student or the person that is on the other side i think is just purely a function of like</p>
<p>how you explain uh hidden beauty that they hadn&rsquo;t realized before it&rsquo;s not easy but i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like a lot of the times it&rsquo;s on like on the creator&rsquo;s side to to be able to like show that</p>
<p>beauty to the other person i think some of that is native to to humans we just have that curiosity</p>
<p>and you look at small toddlers and babies and like them trying to figure things out and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just something that is born with us that we we we want for that understanding of the world</p>
<p>we want for that understanding we want to figure out the world around us and and so yeah it shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be like uh whether or not people are going are going to to enjoy it like i i i also really</p>
<p>believe that everybody has that capacity to fall in love with with math and physics you mentioned</p>
<p>startup what do you think it takes to build a successful startup yeah that it&rsquo;s what what</p>
<p>luis was saying that um you need to in to be able to endure being stuck and and i think the best way</p>
<p>to put it is that startups don&rsquo;t have a linear reward function right you oftentimes don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>rewarded for effort and and and most of our lives we go through these processes that do</p>
<p>give you those small rewards for effort right in school you study hard generally you&rsquo;ll get a good</p>
<p>grade and then you good you get like good grades ever or you get grades every semester and so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>slowly getting rewarded and pushed in the right direction for for startups and startups are not</p>
<p>the only thing that is like this but for startups it&rsquo;s you know you can put in a ton of effort into</p>
<p>something that and then get no reward for it right it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like like sisyphus boulder where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pushing that boulder up the mountain and and and you get to the top and then it just rolls all the</p>
<p>way back down and and so that&rsquo;s something that i think a lot of people are not equipped to deal</p>
<p>with and can be incredibly demoralizing especially if that happens more than than a few times and so</p>
<p>but i think it&rsquo;s absolutely essential to to power through it because um by the nature of startups</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s oftentimes you know you&rsquo;re dealing with with with non obvious ideas and things that</p>
<p>there might be contrarian and so you&rsquo;re gonna you&rsquo;re gonna run into into that a lot you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do things that are not gonna work out and you need to be prepared to deal with that but</p>
<p>but if we&rsquo;re not coming out of college you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re just not equipped i&rsquo;m not sure if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a way to train people to deal with those nonlinear reward functions but it&rsquo;s definitely i think one</p>
<p>of the most difficult things to you know about doing a startup and also happens in research</p>
<p>sometimes you know we&rsquo;re talking about the default state is being stuck you just you know you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like you try things you get zero results you close doors you constantly closing doors until you you</p>
<p>know find something and um yeah that is a big thing what about sort of this point when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>stuck there&rsquo;s a kind of decision whether if you have a vision to persist through with this direction</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve been going along or what a lot of startups do or businesses is pivot how do you</p>
<p>decide whether like to give up on a particular flavor of the way you&rsquo;ve imagined the design</p>
<p>and to like adjust it or completely like alter it i think that&rsquo;s a core question for startups that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve asked myself exactly and like i i&rsquo;ve never been able to come up with a great framework to</p>
<p>make those decisions um i think that&rsquo;s really at the core of uh yeah out of a lot of the the</p>
<p>toughest questions that that people that&rsquo;s that started a company you have to deal with um i think</p>
<p>maybe the best framework that i i have was able to figure out like when you run out of ideas</p>
<p>you just you know you&rsquo;re exploring something is not working you try it in a different angle uh</p>
<p>you know we try a different business model when you run out of ideas like you don&rsquo;t have any more</p>
<p>cards just switch and yeah it&rsquo;s not perfect because you also it&rsquo;s you have a lot of stories</p>
<p>of startups is like people kept pushing and then you know that paid off and then you have uh</p>
<p>philosophies is like fail fast and pivot fast um so it&rsquo;s you know it&rsquo;s hard to you know balance</p>
<p>these two worlds and understand what is the best framework and i mean if you look at for miles</p>
<p>library you&rsquo;re maybe you can correct me but it feels like you&rsquo;re an operating in a space</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a lot of things that are broken and or could be significantly improved so it</p>
<p>feels like there&rsquo;s a lot of possibilities for pivoting or like how do you revolutionize science</p>
<p>how do you revolutionize the aggregation the the annotation the commenting the community around</p>
<p>information of knowledge structured knowledge i mean that&rsquo;s kind of what like stack overflow</p>
<p>and stack exchange has struggled with to come up with a solution and they&rsquo;ve come up i think with</p>
<p>an interesting set of solutions that are also i think flawed in some ways but they&rsquo;re much much</p>
<p>better than the alternatives but there&rsquo;s a lot of other possibilities if we just look at papers as</p>
<p>we talked about there&rsquo;s so many possible revolutions and they&rsquo;re a lot of money to be</p>
<p>potentially made those revolutions plus coupled with that the benefit to humanity and so like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sitting there like i don&rsquo;t know how many people are legitimately from a business perspective</p>
<p>playing with these ideas it feels like there&rsquo;s a lot of ideas here true it varies are you right</p>
<p>now grinding in a particular direction like is there a video like a five year vision that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking in your mind for us it&rsquo;s more like a 20 year vision in the sense that uh we we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>consciously tried to make the decision of so we so we run formats as it&rsquo;s a side project and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>separate in the sense like it&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re working on full time and uh but our thesis there</p>
<p>is that we actually think that it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a good thing at least for for this stage of formats</p>
<p>library um and also because some of these projects you just if you&rsquo;re coming from a start from a</p>
<p>startup framework you probably try to try to fit every single idea into something that can change</p>
<p>the world within three to five years and there&rsquo;s just some problems that take longer than that</p>
<p>right and so you know we&rsquo;re talking about archive and i&rsquo;m very doubtful that you could grow like</p>
<p>archive into what it is today like within two or three years no matter how much money you throw at</p>
<p>it there&rsquo;s just some things that can take longer but you need to be able to power through the the</p>
<p>that the time that it takes um but if you look at it as okay this is a company this is a startup</p>
<p>we have to grow fast we have to raise money then uh then sometimes you might forego those ideas</p>
<p>because of that um because they don&rsquo;t very well fit into the the typical startup framework and</p>
<p>so for us formats it&rsquo;s something that we&rsquo;re okay with growing with having it grow slowly and and</p>
<p>maybe taking many years and and and that&rsquo;s why we think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not a bad thing that it is a side</p>
<p>project because it makes it much more um acceptable in a way and that to to be able to be okay with</p>
<p>that that said i think what happens is if you keep pushing new little features new little ideas</p>
<p>i feel like there&rsquo;s like certain ideas will just become viral like and then you just won&rsquo;t be able</p>
<p>to help yourself but it&rsquo;ll revolutionize things it feels like there needs to be not needs to be</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s um opportunity for viral ideas to change science absolutely and maybe we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what those are yet it might be a very small kind of thing maybe you don&rsquo;t even know if should this</p>
<p>be a for profit company doing these it&rsquo;s the wikipedia question yeah um is that there are a lot</p>
<p>of questions like really fundamental questions about this space um that we&rsquo;ve we&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>i mean you take wikipedia and you try to run it as a startup and by now we&rsquo;d have a paywall you&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>paying 9.99 a month to to read more than 20 articles i mean that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s one view yeah the</p>
<p>other the ad driven model so they rejected the ad driven model i don&rsquo;t know if we could i mean this</p>
<p>is a difficult question you know if archive was supported by ads i don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s bad for</p>
<p>archive if for mass library was supported by ads i don&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t i&rsquo;m not it&rsquo;s not trivial to</p>
<p>me i&rsquo;m unlike i think a lot of people uh i&rsquo;m not against advertisements i think ads when done</p>
<p>well are really good i think the problem with facebook and all the social networks are the way</p>
<p>the lack of transparency around the way they use data and uh the lack of control the users have</p>
<p>over their data not the fact that data is being collected and used to sell advertisements it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lack of transparency lack of control if you if you do a good job with that i feel like it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>nice way to make stuff free yeah it&rsquo;s like stack overflow right i mean i think they&rsquo;ve done a okay</p>
<p>a good job with that uh even though as we said like they&rsquo;re capturing very little of the value</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re putting out there right but but it makes it a sustainable company and and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>providing a lot of it&rsquo;s a fantastic and very productive community let me ask a a ridiculous</p>
<p>tangent of a question please you wrote a paper on uh on game of thrones battle of winterfell just</p>
<p>as a side little i i&rsquo;m sorry i noticed i&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve done a lot of ridiculous stuff like this i</p>
<p>just noticed that particular one by ridiculous i mean ridiculously awesome can you describe the uh</p>
<p>the approach in this work which i believe is a legitimate publication so going back to the</p>
<p>original like uh when we were talking about the backstory of of papers and the importance of that</p>
<p>you know there was a when the last season of the the show was airing uh this was a during a company</p>
<p>lunch we there was in in the last season there&rsquo;s the there&rsquo;s a really big battle against the the</p>
<p>forces of evil and the you know the forces of good and it&rsquo;s called the battle of winterfell</p>
<p>and um in this battle there are like these two armies and there&rsquo;s a very particular thing that</p>
<p>they have to take into account is that in the army of dead like if someone dies in the army of</p>
<p>the living uh like that person is gonna you know be a reborn as a soldier in the army of the dead</p>
<p>yes and so that was a an important thing to take into account and the initial conditions as you</p>
<p>specify it&rsquo;s about a hundred thousand on each side exactly so i was able i was able to like based on</p>
<p>some images or like on previous episodes to figure out what was the size of the armies and so what i</p>
<p>want what we wanted to what we were theorizing was like how many soldiers does like a soldier</p>
<p>on the army of the living has to kill in order for them to be able to destroy the army of the dead</p>
<p>without like losing because every time one of the good soldiers dies gonna turn into like the other</p>
<p>side and so it&rsquo;s so i we we were theorizing that and and i wrote wrote a couple of differential</p>
<p>equations and i was able to figure out that based on the size of the armies i think i think was the</p>
<p>ratio had to be like 1.7 so it had to kill like 1.7 soldiers like the army of the dead in order</p>
<p>for them to win the battle well yeah that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s science it is it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the most powerful</p>
<p>and this is also somehow a pitch for uh like a hiring pitch in a sense like this is the kind of</p>
<p>yeah important science you do exactly well turned out to be you know as as for people that have</p>
<p>watched these shows is like they know that every time you try to predict something that is going</p>
<p>to happen it&rsquo;s going to you&rsquo;re going to fail miserably and that&rsquo;s what happened so it was not</p>
<p>not at all important for the show but yeah we ended up like putting that out and there was a</p>
<p>lot of people that share that i think was some like elements of the of the show the cast of the</p>
<p>show that actually retweeted that and shared that that first one was fun i would love if this kind</p>
<p>of calculation happened uh like during the making of the show or you know i love it like in um</p>
<p>for example i i now know uh alex garland the director of ex machina and i love it he doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>seem to be some not many people seem to do this but i love it when directors and people who wrote</p>
<p>the story really think through the technical details like whether it&rsquo;s knowing like how things</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s science fiction if you were to try to do this how would you do this uh like</p>
<p>stephen wolfram and his son were um were collaborating with the movie arrival in</p>
<p>designing the alien language how you communicate with aliens like how would you really have</p>
<p>uh a math based language that uh that could span the alien and uh being and the human being so i</p>
<p>i love it when they have that kind of rigor the martian was also big on that like the book and</p>
<p>the movie was all about like can we actually you know is this plausible can this happen it was all</p>
<p>about that and that can really bring you in like the sometimes those small details uh i mean the</p>
<p>i mean the the guy that wrote the martian book is another book uh that is also filled with those</p>
<p>like things that when you realize that okay these are grounded in in science can just really bring</p>
<p>you in yeah like the like the he has a book about a colony on the colony on the moon and he goes</p>
<p>about like all the details that would you know be required about setting up a colony in the moon</p>
<p>and like things that he wouldn&rsquo;t think about like the the fact that um they would you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard to bring like uh air to the moon say so they wouldn&rsquo;t like how do you make that breathable that</p>
<p>environment breathable you need to bring oxygen but like you you you probably wouldn&rsquo;t be bring</p>
<p>nitrogen so what you do is like instead of having a an atmosphere that is 100 oxygen you like</p>
<p>decrease the pressure so that you have the same ratio of oxygen on earth but like lowering the</p>
<p>pressure here and so like things like water boils at the lower temperature so people would would</p>
<p>have coffee and the coffee would be colder like there was a problem in this uh environment in</p>
<p>the moon so like and these are like small things in the book but i studied physics so like when i</p>
<p>read these like that throws me into like uh tangents and i start researching that and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like i really like to read books and watch movies when they go to that level of detail uh about</p>
<p>science yeah i think interstellar was one where they also consulted heavily with with a number of</p>
<p>yeah i think even resulted in a couple of papers a couple of papers about like the black hole</p>
<p>um visualizations and um yeah but there isn&rsquo;t and there&rsquo;s even more examples of interesting science</p>
<p>around like these fantasy we were reading at some point like these guys that were trying to figure</p>
<p>out if if the tolkien&rsquo;s middle earth if it was uh round if it was like a sphere yeah it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>flat based on the map based on the map and some of the references in the in the books and so uh</p>
<p>yeah we actually i think we tweeted about that you can yeah we did based on the distance between the</p>
<p>cities you can actually prove that that could be like a map of a sphere or like a spheroid</p>
<p>and and you can actually calculate the radius of that planet uh that&rsquo;s fascinating i mean yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fascinating but there&rsquo;s something about like calculating the number like exactly the</p>
<p>calculation you did for the battle winterfell is um something fascinating about that because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not like being that&rsquo;s very mathematical versus like grounded in physics and that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>interesting i mean that&rsquo;s like injecting mathematics into fantasy there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s something um i see</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re saying about that and and that for me that&rsquo;s why i think it&rsquo;s also when you look at</p>
<p>things like like Fermat&rsquo;s last theorem like problems that are very kind of self contained</p>
<p>and simple to study i think like that&rsquo;s the same with that paper it&rsquo;s very easy to understand the</p>
<p>boundaries of the problem you know um and and that for me that&rsquo;s why those and that&rsquo;s why math is so</p>
<p>appealing and those like problems are also so appealing to the general public it&rsquo;s not that</p>
<p>they look simple or that people think that they are easy to like solve but i feel that a lot of</p>
<p>the times they are almost intellectually democratic because everyone understands the starting point</p>
<p>you know you look at Fermat&rsquo;s last theorem everyone understands like is this is the the</p>
<p>universe of the problem and the same maybe with that paper everyone understands okay these are</p>
<p>the starting conditions and um and and yeah that the fact that it becomes intellectually democratic</p>
<p>and i think that&rsquo;s a huge motivation for people and that&rsquo;s why so so many people gravitate towards</p>
<p>these like Riemann hypotheses or Fermat&rsquo;s last theorem or that simple paper which is like just</p>
<p>one page it was very simple and i just talked to somebody i don&rsquo;t know if you know who he is</p>
<p>Jocko Willink who was uh this person who among many things loves military tactics so he would</p>
<p>probably either publish a follow on paper maybe you guys should collaborate but he would see the</p>
<p>fundamental the basic assumptions that you started that paper with is flawed because you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like dragons too right there&rsquo;s like like you have to integrate tactics because not it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a homogeneous system it&rsquo;s not i don&rsquo;t take into account the dragons and like and he would say</p>
<p>tactics fundamentally change the dynamics of the system and so like that&rsquo;s what happened</p>
<p>so uh yeah so at least from a scientific perspective he was right but he never published</p>
<p>so there you go uh let me ask the most important question you guys are from</p>
<p>um portugal both yeah portugal uh so who is the greatest soccer player footballer of all time</p>
<p>yeah i think we&rsquo;re a little bit biased on this topic but i i mean i don&rsquo;t know i i have i have</p>
<p>a huge i have a you know tremendous respect for for what um here we go this is the political</p>
<p>you can convince you i i i mean i have tremendous respect for what ronaldo has achieved in his</p>
<p>career and and i think soccer is one of those sports where i think you can get to maybe be one</p>
<p>of the best players in the world we if you just have like natural talent and even if you don&rsquo;t put</p>
<p>a lot of hard work and discipline into soccer you can be one of the best players in the world</p>
<p>and i think ronaldo is kind of like of course he&rsquo;s naturally talented but he also ronaldo should say</p>
<p>the the football from exactly from portugal um and and not uh not the brazilian in this case</p>
<p>and so um and ronaldo put like came from nothing he is known from being probably one of the hardest</p>
<p>working athletes in the game and and i see that sometimes a lot of these discussions about the</p>
<p>best player a lot of people tend to gravitate towards like um you know this person is naturally</p>
<p>talented and the other person has to work hard and so and so as if it was bad if he had to work</p>
<p>hard to to be good at something and i think that you know the the i think so many people fall into</p>
<p>that trap and the reason why so many people fall into that trap is because if you&rsquo;re saying that</p>
<p>someone is good and achieved a lot of success by working hard as opposed to achieving success</p>
<p>because he has some sort of god given natural talent that you can&rsquo;t explain why the person was</p>
<p>born with that what does it tell you about you it tells you that maybe if you work hard on a lot of</p>
<p>fields you could have could accomplish a lot of great things and i think that&rsquo;s hard to digest</p>
<p>for a lot of people and and in that way ronaldo&rsquo;s inspiring that i think so you find hard work</p>
<p>inspiring but he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s way too good looking that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the yeah i don&rsquo;t like him no i</p>
<p>like the part of the hard work and like of him being like one of the hardest working athletes</p>
<p>in in soccer so he is to you the greatest of all time is he up there is he would be number</p>
<p>okay do you agree with this thing well i definitely disagree i mean i i like him very much he works</p>
<p>hard i admire i admire you know um what like he&rsquo;s incredible uh goal scorer right um but i</p>
<p>i so first of all leo messi and there was some confusion because i&rsquo;ve kept saying maradona is</p>
<p>my favorite player but i i think i think leo has surpassed them so uh um it&rsquo;s messy then maradona</p>
<p>then pel√© for me but the the reason is is um there&rsquo;s certain aesthetic definitions of beauty</p>
<p>that i admire whether it came by hard work or through god given talent or through anything and</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t it doesn&rsquo;t really matter to me there&rsquo;s certain aesthetic like genius when i when i see it</p>
<p>to me and uh especially it doesn&rsquo;t have to be consistent it is in the case of messi in case</p>
<p>in the ronaldo but just even moments of genius which is where maradona really shines it i even</p>
<p>if that doesn&rsquo;t translate into like results and goals being scored right right and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>challenge like they did that uh because that&rsquo;s where people that tell me that leo messi&rsquo;s never</p>
<p>even on strong teams have led his the national team people as far as the world cup right as</p>
<p>really important and to me no it&rsquo;s the moment like winning to me was never important what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more important is the moments of genius and but you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re talking to the human story and</p>
<p>yeah christiano ronaldo definitely has a beautiful human story yeah and i think you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i for me it&rsquo;s hard to decouple those two um i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t just look at you know the the</p>
<p>list of achievements but i like how he got there and how he keeps pushing the boundaries at like</p>
<p>almost 40 yeah and how that sets up an example like maybe 10 years ago i wouldn&rsquo;t have ever imagined</p>
<p>that like one of the top players in the world could be a top player at like 37 or but so and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an interesting tent the human story is really important but like if you look at ronaldo</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s somebody like kids could aspire to be but at the same time i also like maradona who</p>
<p>like is a is a tragic figure in many ways is like the you know the drugs the the temper</p>
<p>all of those things that&rsquo;s beautiful too like i don&rsquo;t necessarily think to me first the flaws</p>
<p>are beautiful too in in athletes i don&rsquo;t think you need to be perfect i agree uh from a personality</p>
<p>perspective those flaws are also beautiful so but yeah there is something about hard work and</p>
<p>uh there&rsquo;s also something about the being an underdog and being able to carry a team</p>
<p>uh that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s an argument for maradona i don&rsquo;t know if you can make that argument for</p>
<p>messi and ronaldo either because they&rsquo;ve all played on superstar teams for most of their lives</p>
<p>um so i don&rsquo;t know how it you know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s difficult to know how they would do um when they</p>
<p>had to work like did what maradona had to do to carry a team on his shoulders true and pelle did</p>
<p>as well and depending on the the context yeah maybe you could argue that with the portuguese</p>
<p>national team but then we have a good team uh yeah but maybe what maradona did with you know</p>
<p>lap naples and and a couple other teams it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s incredible it speaks to the beauty of the game that</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;re talking about all these different players that have or especially you know if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re comparing messi and ronaldo that have such different you know styles of play and also</p>
<p>even their bodies are so different and and and but these two very different players can be at the top</p>
<p>of the game and that&rsquo;s not that&rsquo;s the there are not a lot of other sports where you where you have</p>
<p>that you know like you have kind of a mental image of a basketball player and like the the top</p>
<p>basketball players kind of fit that mental image and they look a certain way and um but for soccer</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some there&rsquo;s the it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not so much like that and and that&rsquo;s i think that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>beautiful uh but that really adds something to the sport well do you play soccer yourself</p>
<p>have you played that in your your life what do you find beautiful about the game yeah i mean it&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>of the i&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s the biggest sport in portugal and so growing up we played a lot did you see the</p>
<p>paper from deep mind i didn&rsquo;t look at it where they&rsquo;re like uh doing some uh analysis on soccer</p>
<p>strategy interesting i i saved that paper uh i haven&rsquo;t read it yet um it&rsquo;s actually i i when i</p>
<p>was in college i actually did some research on on applying um machine learning and statistics in</p>
<p>sports and in our case in our case we&rsquo;re doing it for basketball um but uh what they&rsquo;re effectively</p>
<p>trying to do was have you ever watched moneyball like so they&rsquo;re trying to do something similar</p>
<p>right taking that in this case basketball taking a statistical approach to to to basketball um</p>
<p>the interesting thing there is that baseball is much more about having these discrete events that</p>
<p>happen kind of in similar conditions and so it&rsquo;s easier to take a statistical approach to it whereas</p>
<p>basketball it&rsquo;s a much more dynamic game uh it&rsquo;s harder to measure um it&rsquo;s hard to to replicate</p>
<p>these conditions and so you you have to think about it in a slightly different way and so we</p>
<p>were doing work on that and working like with the celtics to analyze the the data that they had like</p>
<p>they had these cameras in the in the arena they were tracking the players and so you so they had</p>
<p>a ton of data but they didn&rsquo;t really know what to do with it and so we we were doing work on that</p>
<p>and and and soccer is maybe even a step further it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s right it&rsquo;s a game where you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>as many in basketball you have a lot of field goals and so you can measure success uh soccer</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s right it&rsquo;s more of a process almost where it&rsquo;s like you have a goal like or two in</p>
<p>in a game in terms of metrics i wonder if there&rsquo;s a way and i&rsquo;ve actually have thought about this</p>
<p>in the past never coming up with any good solution if there&rsquo;s a way to definitively say whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>messy or not they&rsquo;re the greatest of all time like like honestly sort of measure interesting</p>
<p>like convert the game of soccer into metrics like you said baseball but like those moments</p>
<p>of genius like past like um you know if it&rsquo;s just about goals or passes that led to goals</p>
<p>yeah that feels like it doesn&rsquo;t capture the genius of the play yeah they&rsquo;ll be like you know like</p>
<p>like you kind of do you have more metrics for instance in chess right and you can try to</p>
<p>understand how hard of a move that was you know there&rsquo;s like bobby fisher has this move that like</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s i think it&rsquo;s called the move of the century where uh you have to go so deep into the</p>
<p>tree to understand that that was the right move and you can quantify how hard it was uh so it&rsquo;d</p>
<p>be interesting to try to think of those type of metrics but say yeah for soccer and computer</p>
<p>vision unlocks some of that for us that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s one possibility i have a cool idea a computer</p>
<p>vision product legs that you could build for soccer let&rsquo;s go i&rsquo;m taking notes if you could</p>
<p>detect the ball and like imagine that um it seems like totally doable right now but like if you could</p>
<p>detect when the ball enters one of the goals and like just had like um you know a crowd cheering</p>
<p>for you when you&rsquo;re playing soccer with your friends every time you score a goal or you had</p>
<p>like the the champions league song going on yeah and like having that like you go play soccer with</p>
<p>your friends just turn that on and there&rsquo;s like a computer vision like program analyzing the ball</p>
<p>detects the ball every time there&rsquo;s a goal like if you miss like there&rsquo;s a you know the fans are</p>
<p>reacting to that and then it should be pretty simple by now it&rsquo;s like i think there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>opportunity yeah just throwing that i&rsquo;m gonna go all out but by the way i did uh i&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>released i was thinking of just putting on github but i did write exactly that which is the trackers</p>
<p>for the players uh for the for the bodies of the player is this is the hard part actually</p>
<p>uh the detection of player bodies and the ball is not hard what&rsquo;s hard is very like robust tracking</p>
<p>through time of each of those so like so i wrote a track of this pretty damn good this is this is</p>
<p>that is that open source you open so i know i&rsquo;ve never released it because interesting because i</p>
<p>felt like i need to i would this is the perfection thing because i knew it was going to be like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna pull me in and and it wasn&rsquo;t really that done and so i&rsquo;ve never actually been part</p>
<p>of a github project where it&rsquo;s like really active development and i didn&rsquo;t want to make it i knew</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a nonzero probability that it will become my life for like a half a year that uh could just</p>
<p>how much i love soccer and all those kinds of things and and ultimately it will be all for just</p>
<p>the the joy of analyzing the game which i&rsquo;m all for i remember you also like one of in one of the</p>
<p>episodes you mentioned that you did also a lot of high tracking analysis on like joe rogan&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>was the that was the research side of my life interesting yeah and you have that library right</p>
<p>you you kind of downloaded all the episodes yep allegedly i and of course i didn&rsquo;t if you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>lawyer i&rsquo;m listening to this no it is yeah i i was listening to the episode where you mentioned</p>
<p>that and i was actually there was something that i and i might ask you for for access to that to</p>
<p>like allegedly that library uh but i was doing some not not regarding like eye tracking but i was</p>
<p>playing around with um analyzing the distribution of silences on uh one of the joe rogan episodes</p>
<p>so like i did that for the elon uh conversation where it&rsquo;s like you just take all the silences</p>
<p>like after joe asked the question and elon responded and you plot that distribution and</p>
<p>like and see how how how that looks like yeah i think there&rsquo;s a huge opportunity especially</p>
<p>long form podcasts to do that kind of analysis bigger than joe exactly but it has to be a fairly</p>
<p>unedited podcast so that you don&rsquo;t get the silence so one of the benefits i have like doing this</p>
<p>podcast is like the what we&rsquo;re recording today is there&rsquo;s individual audio being recorded makes it</p>
<p>so like i have the raw information it&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;s published it&rsquo;s all combined together and individual</p>
<p>video feeds so even when you&rsquo;re listening which i usually don&rsquo;t i only show one video stream</p>
<p>i i&rsquo;ll know i can track your blinks and so on um but yeah but ultimately the hope is you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need that raw data because if you don&rsquo;t need the raw data for whatever analysis you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>you can then do a huge number of parts because there&rsquo;s so it&rsquo;s quickly growing now the number</p>
<p>especially comedians there&rsquo;s uh quite a few comedians with with long form podcasts and</p>
<p>they have a lot of facial expressions they have a lot of fun and all those kinds of things and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s prone for analysis and it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s so many interesting things that that that idea</p>
<p>actually sparked because i was watching a um a q a by by steve jobs and i think it was at mit and</p>
<p>then like people&rsquo;s like he did a talk there and then the q a started and people starting asking</p>
<p>questions that i was i was working while listening to it and like someone asked the question and he</p>
<p>goes like on a 20 second silence before answering the question i like i had to check if the if the</p>
<p>video hadn&rsquo;t paused or or something and and i was thinking about like like if that is a feature of</p>
<p>a person like how long on average you take to respond to a question and if it&rsquo;s like oh that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that has to do with the like how thoughtful you are and if that changes over time oh but it also</p>
<p>could be this really fascinating metric because it also could be it&rsquo;s certainly a feature of a</p>
<p>person but it&rsquo;s also a function of the question like if you normalize to the person you can</p>
<p>probably infer a bunch of stuff about the question so it&rsquo;s a nice flag like it&rsquo;s a really strong</p>
<p>signal the length of that silence but relative to the usual silence they have so one the silence is</p>
<p>a measure of how thoughtful they are and two the particular silence is a measure how thoughtful</p>
<p>the question was thoughtful the question was it&rsquo;s really interesting i mean yeah yeah i just</p>
<p>analyzed elon&rsquo;s uh episode but i think there&rsquo;s like room for exploration there i feel like the</p>
<p>average they could do for comedians would be like i mean the time would be so small because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trained to like i would i would think you&rsquo;re reacting to hecklers you&rsquo;re reacting to all</p>
<p>sorts of things you have to be like so quick maybe right yeah but some of the greatest comedians are</p>
<p>very good at sitting in the silence i mean there there&rsquo;s louis ck they play with that because you</p>
<p>have a rhythm and like um dave chappelle a comedian who did a joe show recently he has uh</p>
<p>especially when he&rsquo;s just having a conversation he does long pauses it&rsquo;s kind of cool because it</p>
<p>uh it it&rsquo;s one of the ways to have people hang in your word is to play with the pauses to play</p>
<p>with the silences and the emphasis and like mid sentence there&rsquo;s a bunch of different things that</p>
<p>uh it&rsquo;d be interesting to really really analyze but still soccer to me is uh that that one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fascinating just i just want a conclusive definitive statement about because like there&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>many soccer highlights of both messi and ronaldo i just feel like the raw data is there</p>
<p>um because you don&rsquo;t have that with pel√© and mardona just yeah true but here&rsquo;s a huge amount</p>
<p>of high dev data then the the annoying the difficult thing and this is really hard for</p>
<p>tracking and this is actually where i kind of gave up because i didn&rsquo;t really give much effort</p>
<p>but i gave up to the the way that highlights or usually football match filmed is they switch</p>
<p>to camera so they&rsquo;ll they&rsquo;ll do a different switch perspective so you have to it&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>interesting computer vision problem when the perspective is switched you still have a lot of</p>
<p>overlap about the players but the perspective is sufficiently different that you have to like</p>
<p>recompute everything so i there there&rsquo;s two ways to solve this so one is doing it the full way where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re constantly doing the slam problem you you&rsquo;re doing a 3d reconstruction the whole time</p>
<p>and projecting into that 3d world but you could also there could be some hacks that i wonder like</p>
<p>some trick where you can hop like when the perspective shifts do a high probability</p>
<p>from one object to another but i i thought especially in exciting moments when when when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re passing players like you&rsquo;re doing a single ball dribble across players and you switch</p>
<p>perspective which is when they often do when you&rsquo;re making a run on goal if you switch your</p>
<p>perspective it&rsquo;s it feels like that&rsquo;s going to be really tricky to get right uh that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>automatically but in that case for instance i feel like if somebody released that data set</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s like you just have all like these this data set a massive data set of all these games</p>
<p>from from say ronaldo and messy like and just you just add that in like whatever csv format and some</p>
<p>some publicly available data set like that i feel like people would just there there would be so</p>
<p>many cool things that you could do with it and you just set it free and then like the world would</p>
<p>like do its thing and then like interesting things would come out of it by the way i have this data</p>
<p>set so the two the two things i&rsquo;ve did of this scale uh is soccer so his body pose and ball</p>
<p>tracking for soccer and then um i try it&rsquo;s pupil tracking and blink tracking for it was joe rogan</p>
<p>and a few other podcasts that i did so those are the two data sets i have did you analyze any of</p>
<p>your podcasts no i i think i really started doing this podcast after after doing that work and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>difficult to maybe i&rsquo;d be afraid of what i find i&rsquo;m already annoyed with my own voice and video</p>
<p>like editing it uh but perhaps that&rsquo;s the honest thing to do because uh one useful thing i about</p>
<p>doing computer vision about myself is like i know what i was thinking at the time so you can start</p>
<p>to like connect the particular the behavioral peculiarities of like the way you blink the way</p>
<p>you squint the way you close your eyes like talking about details there&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like for example i just</p>
<p>closed my eyes is that a blink or no like figuring that out in terms of timing in terms of the link</p>
<p>dynamics it&rsquo;s tricky it&rsquo;s very doable i i think there&rsquo;s universal laws about what is a blink and</p>
<p>what is a closed eye and all those things plus makeup and eyelashes i actually um have annoyingly</p>
<p>long eyelashes so i remember when i was doing a lot of this work i i would cut off my eyelashes</p>
<p>which when like especially it was funny like female colleagues were like what the fuck are</p>
<p>you doing like those no keep the eyelashes but because it got in the way made the computer</p>
<p>vision a lot more difficult but super interesting topics yeah but speaking about the one uh still</p>
<p>on the topic of the data sets for sports there&rsquo;s one um one paper that and i actually annotated</p>
<p>on format and and uh it&rsquo;s it was published in 90s 90s i believe 90s or 80s i forget but it would</p>
<p>they you the researcher was effectively looking at the hot end phenomena in basketball right so</p>
<p>whether like the fact that you just made a field goal um if you know if on your next attempt if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re more likely to make it or not um and it was super interesting because they i mean he polled</p>
<p>like i think 100 undergrads and i think from stanford and cornell and asking people like do</p>
<p>you you think that&rsquo;s that you have a higher likelihood of making your free throw if you just</p>
<p>just made one and i think it&rsquo;s like 68 68 percent said yes they believe that and then he looked</p>
<p>at the data and this was back in as i said like a few decades ago and so i think he had the data</p>
<p>set of about uh he looked at it specifically for free throws and he had a data set of about 5,000</p>
<p>free throws and um and effectively what he found was that specifically in the case of free throws</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t for the aggregate data he didn&rsquo;t find um that he couldn&rsquo;t really spot that correlation</p>
<p>that hot end correlation so if you made the first one you weren&rsquo;t more likely to to make the second</p>
<p>one what he did find was that they were just better at the second one because you just got</p>
<p>like maybe a tiny practice and you just attempted once and then and then you&rsquo;re going to be better</p>
<p>at the next one and then i i then i went and there&rsquo;s a data set on kaggle that has like 600,000</p>
<p>free throws and i reran the the same computations and and and confirmed like you can see a very</p>
<p>clear pattern that they&rsquo;re just better at their second free throw um that&rsquo;s interesting because</p>
<p>i think there&rsquo;s similarly that kind of analysis is so awesome because i think with tennis they</p>
<p>have like uh like a fault like when you serve they have analysis of like are you most likely</p>
<p>to miss the second serve if you missed the first obviously um yeah i think that&rsquo;s the case so that</p>
<p>integrates that&rsquo;s so cool when psychology is converted into metrics in that way and in sports</p>
<p>sports it&rsquo;s especially cool because it&rsquo;s such a constrained system that you can really study</p>
<p>human psychology because it&rsquo;s repeated it&rsquo;s constrained so many things are controlled which</p>
<p>is something you rarely have in in the wild psychological experiments so it&rsquo;s cool uh plus</p>
<p>everyone loves it like sports is really cool to analyze people actually care about the results</p>
<p>yeah um i still think well like i uh i and i will definitely publish uh this work on messy</p>
<p>versus ronaldo and i&rsquo;d love to read it objective fully objective to peer review</p>
<p>um yeah this is very true this is not past period</p>
<p>um let me ask sort of um an advice question to uh to young folks you&rsquo;ve explored a lot of</p>
<p>fascinating ideas in your life you built a startup worked on physics worked on computer science</p>
<p>what advice would you give to young people today in high school maybe early college about life</p>
<p>about career about science and mathematics i remember like uh i read like i remember reading</p>
<p>that um punk area was once asked by a um a french journal about his advice for young people and what</p>
<p>was his teaching philosophy and he said that like one of the most important things that parents</p>
<p>should teach their kids is how to be enthusiastic um in regards to like the mysteries of the world</p>
<p>and that he said like striking that balance was actually one of the most important things between</p>
<p>like in education you know you want to have your kids be enthusiastic about the mysteries of the</p>
<p>world but you also don&rsquo;t want to traumatize them like if you really force them into something</p>
<p>and i think like especially if you&rsquo;re young i think you should be curious and i think you should</p>
<p>explore that curiosity to the fullest to the point where you even become almost as an expert</p>
<p>on that topic and now and you might start with something that it&rsquo;s small like you might start</p>
<p>with you know you&rsquo;re interested in numbers and how to factor numbers into primes and then all of a</p>
<p>sudden you go and and you&rsquo;re like lost in number theory and you discover cryptography and then all</p>
<p>of a sudden you&rsquo;re buying bitcoin and i and i think you should do this um you should really try</p>
<p>to fulfill this curiosity and you should live in a society that allows you to fulfill this curiosity</p>
<p>which is also important and i think you should do this not to get to some sort of status or fame or</p>
<p>money but i think this is the way this iterative process i think this is the way to find happiness</p>
<p>and and i think this is also allows you to find the meaning for your life i think it&rsquo;s all about</p>
<p>like being curious and being able to fulfill that curiosity and that path to fulfilling that your</p>
<p>curiosity yeah the the start small let the fire build this kind of interesting way to think about</p>
<p>it and you never know where you&rsquo;re going to end up it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like for us is just a really good</p>
<p>example we started like by doing this as an internal like thing that we did in the company</p>
<p>and then we started putting out there and now a lot of people follow it and know about it and so</p>
<p>and you still don&rsquo;t know where from our library is going to end up actually true exactly so um</p>
<p>yeah i think that would be my piece of advice with very limited experience of course but yeah yeah i</p>
<p>agree i agree uh i mean is there something in from particular joao from the computer science</p>
<p>versus physics perspective uh do do you regret not doing physics do you regret not doing computer</p>
<p>science which one is the the wiser the better human being this is messy versus ronaldo um</p>
<p>those are very i i don&rsquo;t know if you would agree but they&rsquo;re kind of different disciplines true</p>
<p>yeah very much so um i actually i actually uh i was i had that question in my mind i i took</p>
<p>physics classes as an undergrad or like besides what i had to take and um it&rsquo;s definitely something</p>
<p>that i considered at some point um and and that i i i do feel like later in life that might be</p>
<p>something that i&rsquo;m not sure if regret is is the right word but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s kind of something that</p>
<p>i can imagine in an alternative universe what would have happened if i if i got into physics</p>
<p>um i try to think that like well depends on what your path ends up being but that it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>super important right like exactly what you decide to major on like i think there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>um i think tim urban like the blogger had a good visualization of this where it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know like he he he has a picture where you have all sorts of paths that you could pursue in</p>
<p>your life and then maybe you&rsquo;re in the middle of it and so there&rsquo;s maybe some paths that are not</p>
<p>accessible to you but like the the tree that is still in front of you gives you a lot of optionality</p>
<p>and so um there&rsquo;s two lessons to learn from that like we have a huge number of options now</p>
<p>and probably you&rsquo;re just one to reflect like to try to uh derive wisdom from the one little path</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve taken so far may be flawed because there&rsquo;s all these other paths you could have taken yeah so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like uh so one it&rsquo;s inspiring that you can take any path now and two it&rsquo;s like you you the</p>
<p>path you&rsquo;ve taken so far is just one of many possible ones but it does seem that like physics</p>
<p>and computer science both open a lot of doors and a lot of different doors it&rsquo;s very interesting it</p>
<p>is i i like in this case like and especially in in our case because i could see the difference i</p>
<p>studied i i went to college in europe and joel went to college here in the u.s so i could see</p>
<p>the difference and like in the european system is um more rigid in the sense that when you decide</p>
<p>to study physics you don&rsquo;t have a lot especially in the early years you don&rsquo;t have a lot of um</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t choose to take like a class from like computer science course or something like that</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a lot of freedom to explore in that sense in university as opposed to here in the</p>
<p>u.s where you have more freedom and i think um i think that&rsquo;s important i think that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>constitutes you know a good kind of educational system is one that gravitates towards the interests</p>
<p>of a student as as you progress but i think in order for you to do that you need to explore</p>
<p>different areas and i i felt like if i had a chance to take say more computer science class</p>
<p>when i was in college i would have probably have taken those classes but um yeah but i ended up</p>
<p>like focusing maybe too like too much in physics and uh i think here at least my perception is</p>
<p>that you can explore more more fields but there is a kind of it&rsquo;s funny but physics can be difficult</p>
<p>so i don&rsquo;t see too many computer science people than exploring into physics it&rsquo;s only like the one</p>
<p>the not the one but one of the beneficial things of physics it feels like it uh what was it rutherford</p>
<p>that said like like basically that physics is the hard thing and everything is easy uh so like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a certain sense once you&rsquo;ve figured out some basic like physics that it&rsquo;s not that you</p>
<p>need the tools of physics to understand the other disciplines it&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re empowered by having</p>
<p>done difficult shit i mean the ultimate i think is probably mathematics there yeah true uh so maybe</p>
<p>just doing difficult things and proving to yourself that you can do difficult things whatever those</p>
<p>are that&rsquo;s net positive i believe net positive yeah and i think like i i before i started company</p>
<p>i had like i i worked in the financial sector for a bit and like i think having a physics background</p>
<p>i was i felt i was not afraid of like learning like finance things and i think like when you</p>
<p>come from those backgrounds you are generally not afraid of stepping into other fields and learning</p>
<p>about those because um yeah i feel we&rsquo;ve learned a lot of difficult things and um yeah that&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>added benefit i believe this was uh an incredible conversation louise joao we started with uh who</p>
<p>do we start with fineman ended up with messi and ronaldo so this is like the perfect conversation</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really an honor that you guys would waste all this time with me today it was really fun</p>
<p>thanks for talking so much for having us yeah thank you so much thanks for listening to this</p>
<p>conversation with louise and joao batala and thank you to skiff simply safe and thank you</p>
<p>for watching this podcast simply safe indeed net sweet and for sigmatic check them out in the</p>
<p>description to support this podcast and now let me leave you with some words from richard fineman</p>
<p>nobody ever figures out what life is all about and it doesn&rsquo;t matter explore the world nearly</p>
<p>everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough thank you for listening i hope</p>
<p>to see you next time</p>
