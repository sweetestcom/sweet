    <p>The following is a conversation with George Hotz,</p>
<p>AKA Geohot, his second time on the podcast.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the founder of Comma AI,</p>
<p>an autonomous and semi autonomous vehicle technology company</p>
<p>that seeks to be to Tesla Autopilot</p>
<p>what Android is to the iOS.</p>
<p>They sell the Comma 2 device for $1,000</p>
<p>that when installed in many of their supported cars</p>
<p>can keep the vehicle centered in the lane</p>
<p>even when there are no lane markings.</p>
<p>It includes driver sensing</p>
<p>that ensures that the driver&rsquo;s eyes are on the road.</p>
<p>As you may know, I&rsquo;m a big fan of driver sensing.</p>
<p>I do believe Tesla Autopilot and others</p>
<p>should definitely include it in their sensor suite.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;m a fan of Android and a big fan of George</p>
<p>for many reasons,</p>
<p>including his nonlinear out of the box brilliance</p>
<p>and the fact that he&rsquo;s a superstar programmer</p>
<p>of a very different style than myself.</p>
<p>Styles make fights and styles make conversations.</p>
<p>So I really enjoyed this chat</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll talk many more times on this podcast.</p>
<p>Quick mention of a sponsor</p>
<p>followed by some thoughts related to the episode.</p>
<p>First is Four Sigmatic,</p>
<p>the maker of delicious mushroom coffee.</p>
<p>Second is The Coding Digital,</p>
<p>a podcast on tech and entrepreneurship</p>
<p>that I listen to and enjoy.</p>
<p>And finally, ExpressVPN,</p>
<p>the VPN I&rsquo;ve used for many years to protect my privacy</p>
<p>on the internet.</p>
<p>Please check out the sponsors in the description</p>
<p>to get a discount and to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that my work at MIT</p>
<p>on autonomous and semi autonomous vehicles</p>
<p>led me to study the human side of autonomy</p>
<p>enough to understand that it&rsquo;s a beautifully complicated</p>
<p>and interesting problem space,</p>
<p>much richer than what can be studied in the lab.</p>
<p>In that sense, the data that Comma AI, Tesla Autopilot</p>
<p>and perhaps others like Cadillac Super Cruiser collecting</p>
<p>gives us a chance to understand</p>
<p>how we can design safe semi autonomous vehicles</p>
<p>for real human beings in real world conditions.</p>
<p>I think this requires bold innovation</p>
<p>and a serious exploration of the first principles</p>
<p>of the driving task itself.</p>

<p>And now here&rsquo;s my conversation with George Hotz.</p>
<p>So last time we started talking about the simulation,</p>
<p>this time let me ask you,</p>
<p>do you think there&rsquo;s intelligent life out there</p>
<p>in the universe?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always maintained my answer to the Fermi paradox.</p>
<p>I think there has been intelligent life</p>
<p>elsewhere in the universe.</p>
<p>So intelligent civilizations existed</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve blown themselves up.</p>
<p>So your general intuition is that</p>
<p>intelligent civilizations quickly,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s that parameter in the Drake equation.</p>
<p>Your sense is they don&rsquo;t last very long.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How are we doing on that?</p>
<p>Like, have we lasted pretty good?</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>Are we do?</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, not quite yet.</p>
<p>Well, it was good to tell you,</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;d ask the IQ required to destroy the world</p>
<p>falls by one point every year.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Technology democratizes the destruction of the world.</p>
<p>When can a meme destroy the world?</p>
<p>It kind of is already, right?</p>
<p>Somewhat.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve seen anywhere near the worst of it yet.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s going to get weird.</p>
<p>Well, maybe a meme can save the world.</p>
<p>You thought about that?</p>
<p>The meme Lord Elon Musk fighting on the side of good</p>
<p>versus the meme Lord of the darkness,</p>
<p>which is not saying anything bad about Donald Trump,</p>
<p>but he is the Lord of the meme on the dark side.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a Darth Vader of memes.</p>
<p>I think in every fairy tale they always end it with,</p>
<p>and they lived happily ever after.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, please tell me more</p>
<p>about this happily ever after.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard 50% of marriages end in divorce.</p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t your marriage end up there?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just say happily ever after.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the thing about destruction</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s over after the destruction.</p>
<p>We have to do everything right in order to avoid it.</p>
<p>And one thing wrong,</p>
<p>I mean, actually this is what I really like</p>
<p>about cryptography.</p>
<p>Cryptography, it seems like we live in a world</p>
<p>where the defense wins versus like nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>The opposite is true.</p>
<p>It is much easier to build a warhead</p>
<p>that splits into a hundred little warheads</p>
<p>than to build something that can, you know,</p>
<p>take out a hundred little warheads.</p>
<p>The offense has the advantage there.</p>
<p>So maybe our future is in crypto, but.</p>
<p>So cryptography, right.</p>
<p>The Goliath is the defense.</p>
<p>And then all the different hackers are the Davids.</p>
<p>And that equation is flipped for nuclear war.</p>
<p>Cause there&rsquo;s so many,</p>
<p>like one nuclear weapon destroys everything essentially.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it is much easier to attack with a nuclear weapon</p>
<p>than it is to like the technology required to intercept</p>
<p>and destroy a rocket is much more complicated</p>
<p>than the technology required to just, you know,</p>
<p>orbital trajectory, send a rocket to somebody.</p>
<p>So, okay.</p>
<p>Your intuition that there were intelligent civilizations</p>
<p>out there, but it&rsquo;s very possible</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re no longer there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of a sad picture.</p>
<p>They enter some steady state.</p>
<p>They all wirehead themselves.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s wirehead?</p>
<p>Stimulate, stimulate their pleasure centers</p>
<p>and just, you know, live forever in this kind of stasis.</p>
<p>They become, well, I mean,</p>
<p>I think the reason I believe this is because where are they?</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s some reason they stopped expanding,</p>
<p>cause otherwise they would have taken over the universe.</p>
<p>The universe isn&rsquo;t that big.</p>
<p>Or at least, you know,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just talk about the galaxy, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 70,000 light years across.</p>
<p>I took that number from Star Trek Voyager.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how true it is, but yeah, that&rsquo;s not big.</p>
<p>Right? 70,000 light years is nothing.</p>
<p>For some possible technology that you can imagine</p>
<p>that can leverage like wormholes or something like that.</p>
<p>Or you don&rsquo;t even need wormholes.</p>
<p>Just a von Neumann probe is enough.</p>
<p>A von Neumann probe and a million years of sublight travel</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d have taken over the whole universe.</p>
<p>That clearly didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>So something stopped it.</p>
<p>So you mean if you, right,</p>
<p>for like a few million years,</p>
<p>if you sent out probes that travel close,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s sublight?</p>
<p>You mean close to the speed of light?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say 0.1 C.</p>
<p>And it just spreads.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Actually, that&rsquo;s an interesting calculation, huh?</p>
<p>So what makes you think that we&rsquo;d be able</p>
<p>to communicate with them?</p>
<p>Like, yeah, what&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>why do you think we would be able to be able</p>
<p>to comprehend intelligent lives that are out there?</p>
<p>Like even if they were among us kind of thing,</p>
<p>like, or even just flying around?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, that&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that there is some sort of prime directive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be a really cool universe to live in.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some reason</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not making themselves visible to us.</p>
<p>But it makes sense that they would use the same,</p>
<p>well, at least the same entropy.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re implying the same laws of physics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what you mean by entropy in this case.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, if entropy is the scarce resource in the universe.</p>
<p>So what do you think about like Stephen Wolfram</p>
<p>and everything is a computation?</p>
<p>And then what if they are traveling through</p>
<p>this world of computation?</p>
<p>So if you think of the universe</p>
<p>as just information processing,</p>
<p>then what you&rsquo;re referring to with entropy</p>
<p>and then these pockets of interesting complex computation</p>
<p>swimming around, how do we know they&rsquo;re not already here?</p>
<p>How do we know that this,</p>
<p>like all the different amazing things</p>
<p>that are full of mystery on earth</p>
<p>are just like little footprints of intelligence</p>
<p>from light years away?</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>I mean, I tend to think that as civilizations expand,</p>
<p>they use more and more energy</p>
<p>and you can never overcome the problem of waste heat.</p>
<p>So where is there waste heat?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;d be able to, with our crude methods,</p>
<p>be able to see like, there&rsquo;s a whole lot of energy here.</p>
<p>But it could be something we&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>I mean, we don&rsquo;t understand dark energy, right?</p>
<p>Dark matter.</p>
<p>It could be just stuff we don&rsquo;t understand at all.</p>
<p>Or they can have a fundamentally different physics,</p>
<p>you know, like that we just don&rsquo;t even comprehend.</p>
<p>Well, I think, okay,</p>
<p>I mean, it depends how far out you wanna go.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think physics is very different</p>
<p>on the other side of the galaxy.</p>
<p>I would suspect that they have,</p>
<p>I mean, if they&rsquo;re in our universe,</p>
<p>they have the same physics.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, that&rsquo;s the assumption we have,</p>
<p>but there could be like super trippy things</p>
<p>like our cognition only gets to a slice,</p>
<p>and all the possible instruments that we can design</p>
<p>only get to a particular slice of the universe.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something much like weirder.</p>
<p>Maybe we can try a thought experiment.</p>
<p>Would people from the past</p>
<p>be able to detect the remnants of our,</p>
<p>or would we be able to detect our modern civilization?</p>
<p>I think the answer is obviously yes.</p>
<p>You mean past from a hundred years ago?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s even go back further.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to a million years ago, right?</p>
<p>The humans who were lying around in the desert</p>
<p>probably didn&rsquo;t even have,</p>
<p>maybe they just barely had fire.</p>
<p>They would understand if a 747 flew overhead.</p>
<p>Oh, in this vicinity, but not if a 747 flew on Mars.</p>
<p>Like, cause they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to see far,</p>
<p>cause we&rsquo;re not actually communicating that well</p>
<p>with the rest of the universe.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing okay.</p>
<p>Just sending out random like fifties tracks of music.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>And yeah, I mean, they&rsquo;d have to, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve only been broadcasting radio waves for 150 years.</p>
<p>And well, there&rsquo;s your light cone.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p>What do you make about all the,</p>
<p>I recently came across this having talked to David Fravor.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you caught what the videos</p>
<p>of the Pentagon released</p>
<p>and the New York Times reporting of the UFO sightings.</p>
<p>So I kind of looked into it, quote unquote.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s actually been like hundreds</p>
<p>of thousands of UFO sightings, right?</p>
<p>And a lot of it you can explain away</p>
<p>in different kinds of ways.</p>
<p>So one is it could be interesting physical phenomena.</p>
<p>Two, it could be people wanting to believe</p>
<p>and therefore they conjure up a lot of different things</p>
<p>that just, you know, when you see different kinds of lights,</p>
<p>some basic physics phenomena,</p>
<p>and then you just conjure up ideas</p>
<p>of possible out there mysterious worlds.</p>
<p>But, you know, it&rsquo;s also possible,</p>
<p>like you have a case of David Fravor,</p>
<p>who is a Navy pilot, who&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>as legit as it gets in terms of humans</p>
<p>who are able to perceive things in the environment</p>
<p>and make conclusions,</p>
<p>whether those things are a threat or not.</p>
<p>And he and several other pilots saw a thing,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you followed this,</p>
<p>but they saw a thing that they&rsquo;ve since then called TikTok</p>
<p>that moved in all kinds of weird ways.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know what it is.</p>
<p>It could be technology developed by the United States</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just not aware of it</p>
<p>and the surface level from the Navy, right?</p>
<p>It could be different kind of lighting technology</p>
<p>or drone technology, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>It could be the Russians and the Chinese,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And of course their mind, our mind,</p>
<p>can also venture into the possibility</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s from another world.</p>
<p>Have you looked into this at all?</p>
<p>What do you think about it?</p>
<p>I think all the news is a psyop.</p>
<p>I think that the most plausible.</p>
<p>Nothing is real.</p>
<p>Yeah, I listened to the, I think it was Bob Lazar</p>
<p>on Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>And like, I believe everything this guy is saying.</p>
<p>And then I think that it&rsquo;s probably just some like MKUltra</p>
<p>kind of thing, you know?</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>Like they, you know, they made some weird thing</p>
<p>and they called it an alien spaceship.</p>
<p>You know, maybe it was just to like</p>
<p>stimulate young physicists minds.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll tell them it&rsquo;s alien technology</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll see what they come up with, right?</p>
<p>Do you find any conspiracy theories compelling?</p>
<p>Like have you pulled at the string</p>
<p>of the rich complex world of conspiracy theories</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s out there?</p>
<p>I think that I&rsquo;ve heard a conspiracy theory</p>
<p>that conspiracy theories were invented by the CIA</p>
<p>in the 60s to discredit true things.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, you know, you can go to ridiculous conspiracy theories</p>
<p>like Flat Earth and Pizza Gate.</p>
<p>And, you know, these things are almost to hide</p>
<p>like conspiracy theories that like,</p>
<p>you know, remember when the Chinese like locked up</p>
<p>the doctors who discovered coronavirus?</p>
<p>Like I tell people this and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>no, no, no, that&rsquo;s not a conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>That actually happened.</p>
<p>Do you remember the time that the money used to be backed</p>
<p>by gold and now it&rsquo;s backed by nothing?</p>
<p>This is not a conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>This actually happened.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s one of my worries today</p>
<p>with the idea of fake news is that when nothing is real,</p>
<p>then like you dilute the possibility of anything being true</p>
<p>by conjuring up all kinds of conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>And then you don&rsquo;t know what to believe.</p>
<p>And then like the idea of truth of objectivity</p>
<p>is lost completely.</p>
<p>Everybody has their own truth.</p>
<p>So you used to control information by censoring it.</p>
<p>And then the internet happened and governments were like,</p>
<p>oh shit, we can&rsquo;t censor things anymore.</p>
<p>I know what we&rsquo;ll do.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s the old story of the story of like</p>
<p>tying a flag with a leprechaun tells you his gold is buried</p>
<p>and you tie one flag and you make the leprechaun swear</p>
<p>to not remove the flag.</p>
<p>And you come back to the field later with a shovel</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s flags everywhere.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one way to maintain privacy, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like in order to protect the contents</p>
<p>of this conversation, for example,</p>
<p>we could just generate like millions of deep,</p>
<p>fake conversations where you and I talk</p>
<p>and say random things.</p>
<p>So this is just one of them</p>
<p>and nobody knows which one was the real one.</p>
<p>This could be fake right now.</p>
<p>Classic steganography technique.</p>
<p>Okay, another absurd question about intelligent life.</p>
<p>Cause you know, you&rsquo;re an incredible programmer</p>
<p>outside of everything else we&rsquo;ll talk about</p>
<p>just as a programmer.</p>
<p>Do you think intelligent beings out there,</p>
<p>the civilizations that were out there,</p>
<p>had computers and programming?</p>
<p>Did they, do we naturally have to develop something</p>
<p>where we engineer machines and are able to encode</p>
<p>both knowledge into those machines</p>
<p>and instructions that process that knowledge,</p>
<p>process that information to make decisions</p>
<p>and actions and so on?</p>
<p>And would those programming languages,</p>
<p>if you think they exist, be at all similar</p>
<p>to anything we&rsquo;ve developed?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t see that much of a difference</p>
<p>between quote unquote natural languages</p>
<p>and programming languages.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s so many similarities.</p>
<p>So when asked the question,</p>
<p>what do alien languages look like?</p>
<p>I imagine they&rsquo;re not all that dissimilar from ours.</p>
<p>And I think translating in and out of them</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be that crazy.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s difficult to compile like DNA to Python</p>
<p>and then to C.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little bit of a gap in the kind of languages</p>
<p>we use for touring machines</p>
<p>and the kind of languages nature seems to use a little bit.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s just, we just haven&rsquo;t understood</p>
<p>the kind of language that nature uses well yet.</p>
<p>DNA is a CAD model.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not quite a programming language.</p>
<p>It has no sort of a serial execution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not quite a, yeah, it&rsquo;s a CAD model.</p>
<p>So I think in that sense,</p>
<p>we actually completely understand it.</p>
<p>The problem is, well, simulating on these CAD models,</p>
<p>I played with it a bit this year,</p>
<p>is super computationally intensive.</p>
<p>If you wanna go down to like the molecular level</p>
<p>where you need to go to see a lot of these phenomenon</p>
<p>like protein folding.</p>
<p>So yeah, it&rsquo;s not that we don&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>It just requires a whole lot of compute to kind of compile it.</p>
<p>For our human minds, it&rsquo;s inefficient,</p>
<p>both for the data representation and for the programming.</p>
<p>Yeah, it runs well on raw nature.</p>
<p>It runs well on raw nature.</p>
<p>And when we try to build emulators or simulators for that,</p>
<p>well, they&rsquo;re mad slow, but I&rsquo;ve tried it.</p>
<p>It runs in that, yeah, you&rsquo;ve commented elsewhere,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember where,</p>
<p>that one of the problems is simulating nature is tough.</p>
<p>And if you want to sort of deploy a prototype,</p>
<p>I forgot how you put it, but it made me laugh,</p>
<p>but animals or humans would need to be involved</p>
<p>in order to try to run some prototype code on,</p>
<p>like if we&rsquo;re talking about COVID and viruses and so on,</p>
<p>if you were trying to engineer</p>
<p>some kind of defense mechanisms,</p>
<p>like a vaccine against COVID and all that kind of stuff</p>
<p>that doing any kind of experimentation,</p>
<p>like you can with like autonomous vehicles</p>
<p>would be very technically and ethically costly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about that.</p>
<p>I think you can do tons of crazy biology and test tubes.</p>
<p>I think my bigger complaint is more,</p>
<p>oh, the tools are so bad.</p>
<p>Like literally, you mean like libraries and?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m not pipetting shit.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re handing me a, I got a, no, no, no,</p>
<p>there has to be some.</p>
<p>Like automating stuff.</p>
<p>And like the, yeah, but human biology is messy.</p>
<p>Like it seems.</p>
<p>But like, look at those Toronto&rsquo;s videos.</p>
<p>They were a joke.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a little gantry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like little X, Y gantry,</p>
<p>high school science project with the pipette.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, really?</p>
<p>Gotta be something better.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t build like nice microfluidics</p>
<p>and I can program the computation to bio interface.</p>
<p>I mean, this is gonna happen.</p>
<p>But like right now, if you are asking me</p>
<p>to pipette 50 milliliters of solution, I&rsquo;m out.</p>
<p>This is so crude.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s get all the crazy out of the way.</p>
<p>So a bunch of people asked me,</p>
<p>since we talked about the simulation last time,</p>
<p>we talked about hacking the simulation.</p>
<p>Do you have any updates, any insights</p>
<p>about how we might be able to go about hacking simulation</p>
<p>if we indeed do live in a simulation?</p>
<p>I think a lot of people misinterpreted</p>
<p>the point of that South by talk.</p>
<p>The point of the South by talk</p>
<p>was not literally to hack the simulation.</p>
<p>I think that this is an idea is literally just,</p>
<p>I think theoretical physics.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the whole goal, right?</p>
<p>You want your grand unified theory, but then, okay,</p>
<p>build a grand unified theory search for exploits, right?</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re nowhere near actually there yet.</p>
<p>My hope with that was just more to like,</p>
<p>are you people kidding me</p>
<p>with the things you spend time thinking about?</p>
<p>Do you understand like kind of how small you are?</p>
<p>You are bytes and God&rsquo;s computer, really?</p>
<p>And the things that people get worked up about, you know?</p>
<p>So basically, it was more a message</p>
<p>of we should humble ourselves.</p>
<p>That we get to, like what are we humans in this byte code?</p>
<p>Yeah, and not just humble ourselves,</p>
<p>but like I&rsquo;m not trying to like make people guilty</p>
<p>or anything like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to say like, literally,</p>
<p>look at what you are spending time on, right?</p>
<p>What are you referring to?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re referring to the Kardashians?</p>
<p>What are we talking about?</p>
<p>Twitter?</p>
<p>No, the Kardashians, everyone knows that&rsquo;s kind of fun.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m referring more to like the economy, you know?</p>
<p>This idea that we gotta up our stock price.</p>
<p>Or what is the goal function of humanity?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t like the game of capitalism?</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t like the games we&rsquo;ve constructed</p>
<p>for ourselves as humans?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of capitalism.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s really the game we&rsquo;re playing right now.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re playing a different game</p>
<p>where the rules are rigged.</p>
<p>Okay, which games are interesting to you</p>
<p>that we humans have constructed and which aren&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>Which are productive and which are not?</p>
<p>Actually, maybe that&rsquo;s the real point of the talk.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, stop playing these fake human games.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a real game here.</p>
<p>We can play the real game.</p>
<p>The real game is, you know, nature wrote the rules.</p>
<p>This is a real game.</p>
<p>There still is a game to play.</p>
<p>But if you look at, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve seen the Instagram account,</p>
<p>nature is metal.</p>
<p>The game that nature seems to be playing</p>
<p>is a lot more cruel than we humans want to put up with.</p>
<p>Or at least we see it as cruel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the bigger thing eats the smaller thing</p>
<p>and does it to impress another big thing</p>
<p>so it can mate with that thing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That seems to be the entirety of it.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s no art, there&rsquo;s no music,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no comma AI, there&rsquo;s no comma one,</p>
<p>no comma two, no George Hots with his brilliant talks</p>
<p>at South by Southwest.</p>
<p>I disagree, though.</p>
<p>I disagree that this is what nature is.</p>
<p>I think nature just provided basically a open world MMORPG.</p>
<p>And, you know, here it&rsquo;s open world.</p>
<p>I mean, if that&rsquo;s the game you want to play,</p>
<p>you can play that game.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t that beautiful?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you played Diablo.</p>
<p>They used to have, I think, cow level where it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>So everybody will go just, they figured out this,</p>
<p>like the best way to gain like experience points</p>
<p>is to just slaughter cows over and over and over.</p>
<p>And so they figured out this little sub game</p>
<p>within the bigger game that this is the most efficient way</p>
<p>to get experience points.</p>
<p>And everybody somehow agreed</p>
<p>that getting experience points in RPG context</p>
<p>where you always want to be getting more stuff,</p>
<p>more skills, more levels, keep advancing.</p>
<p>That seems to be good.</p>
<p>So might as well sacrifice actual enjoyment</p>
<p>of playing a game, exploring a world,</p>
<p>and spending like hundreds of hours of your time</p>
<p>at cow level.</p>
<p>I mean, the number of hours I spent in cow level,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not like the most impressive person</p>
<p>because people have spent probably thousands of hours there,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a little absurd game that brought me joy</p>
<p>in some weird dopamine drug kind of way.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t like those games.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s us humans feeling the nature.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>And that was the point of the talk.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So how do we hack it then?</p>
<p>Well, I want to live forever.</p>
<p>And I want to live forever.</p>
<p>And this is the goal.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a game against nature.</p>
<p>Yeah, immortality is the good objective function to you?</p>
<p>I mean, start there and then you can do whatever else</p>
<p>you want because you got a long time.</p>
<p>What if immortality makes the game just totally not fun?</p>
<p>I mean, like, why do you assume immortality</p>
<p>is somehow a good objective function?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not immortality that I want.</p>
<p>A true immortality where I could not die,</p>
<p>I would prefer what we have right now.</p>
<p>But I want to choose my own death, of course.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want nature to decide when I die,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to win.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be you.</p>
<p>And then at some point, if you choose commit suicide,</p>
<p>like how long do you think you&rsquo;d live?</p>
<p>Until I get bored.</p>
<p>See, I don&rsquo;t think people like brilliant people like you</p>
<p>that really ponder living a long time</p>
<p>are really considering how meaningless life becomes.</p>
<p>Well, I want to know everything and then I&rsquo;m ready to die.</p>
<p>As long as there&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, but why do you want,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it possible that you want to know everything</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s finite?</p>
<p>Like the reason you want to know quote unquote everything</p>
<p>is because you don&rsquo;t have enough time to know everything.</p>
<p>And once you have unlimited time,</p>
<p>then you realize like, why do anything?</p>
<p>Like why learn anything?</p>
<p>I want to know everything and then I&rsquo;m ready to die.</p>
<p>So you have, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a, like, it&rsquo;s a terminal value.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not in service of anything else.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m conscious of the possibility, this is not a certainty,</p>
<p>but the possibility of that engine of curiosity</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re speaking to is actually</p>
<p>a symptom of the finiteness of life.</p>
<p>Like without that finiteness, your curiosity would vanish.</p>
<p>Like a morning fog.</p>
<p>All right, cool.</p>
<p>Bukowski talked about love like that.</p>
<p>Then let me solve immortality</p>
<p>and let me change the thing in my brain</p>
<p>that reminds me of the fact that I&rsquo;m immortal,</p>
<p>tells me that life is finite shit.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll have it tell me that life ends next week.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m okay with some self manipulation like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m okay with deceiving myself.</p>
<p>Oh, Rika, changing the code.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, if that&rsquo;s the problem, right?</p>
<p>If the problem is that I will no longer have that,</p>
<p>that curiosity, I&rsquo;d like to have backup copies of myself,</p>
<p>which I check in with occasionally</p>
<p>to make sure they&rsquo;re okay with the trajectory</p>
<p>and they can kind of override it.</p>
<p>Maybe a nice, like, I think of like those wave nets,</p>
<p>those like logarithmic go back to the copies.</p>
<p>Yeah, but sometimes it&rsquo;s not reversible.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve done this with video games.</p>
<p>Once you figure out the cheat code</p>
<p>or like you look up how to cheat old school,</p>
<p>like single player, it ruins the game for you.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>It ruins that feeling.</p>
<p>But again, that just means our brain manipulation</p>
<p>technology is not good enough yet.</p>
<p>Remove that cheat code from your brain.</p>
<p>Here you go.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s also possible that if we figure out immortality,</p>
<p>that all of us will kill ourselves</p>
<p>before we advance far enough</p>
<p>to be able to revert the change.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not killing myself till I know everything, so.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you say now, because your life is finite.</p>
<p>You know, I think yes, self modifying systems gets,</p>
<p>comes up with all these hairy complexities</p>
<p>and can I promise that I&rsquo;ll do it perfectly?</p>
<p>No, but I think I can put good safety structures in place.</p>
<p>So that talk and your thinking here</p>
<p>is not literally referring to a simulation</p>
<p>and that our universe is a kind of computer program</p>
<p>running on a computer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more of a thought experiment.</p>
<p>Do you also think of the potential of the sort of Bostrom,</p>
<p>Elon Musk and others that talk about an actual program</p>
<p>that simulates our universe?</p>
<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t doubt that we&rsquo;re in a simulation.</p>
<p>I just think that it&rsquo;s not quite that important.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m interested only in simulation theory</p>
<p>as far as like it gives me power over nature.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s totally unfalsifiable, then who cares?</p>
<p>I mean, what do you think that experiment would look like?</p>
<p>Like somebody on Twitter asks,</p>
<p>asks George what signs we would look for</p>
<p>to know whether or not we&rsquo;re in the simulation,</p>
<p>which is exactly what you&rsquo;re asking is like,</p>
<p>the step that precedes the step of knowing</p>
<p>how to get more power from this knowledge</p>
<p>is to get an indication that there&rsquo;s some power to be gained.</p>
<p>So get an indication that there,</p>
<p>you can discover and exploit cracks in the simulation</p>
<p>or it doesn&rsquo;t have to be in the physics of the universe.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Show me, I mean, like a memory leak could be cool.</p>
<p>Like some scrying technology, you know?</p>
<p>What kind of technology?</p>
<p>Scrying?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s a weird,</p>
<p>scrying is the paranormal ability to like remote viewing,</p>
<p>like being able to see somewhere where you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>So, you know, I don&rsquo;t think you can do it</p>
<p>by chanting in a room,</p>
<p>but if we could find, it&rsquo;s a memory leak, basically.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a memory leak.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re able to access parts you&rsquo;re not supposed to.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And thereby discover a shortcut.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe memory leak means the other thing as well,</p>
<p>but I mean like, yeah,</p>
<p>like an ability to read arbitrary memory, right?</p>
<p>And that one&rsquo;s not that horrifying, right?</p>
<p>The right ones start to be horrifying.</p>
<p>Read, right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the reading is not the problem.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like Heartfleet for the universe.</p>
<p>Oh boy, the writing is a big, big problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the moment you can write anything,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s just random noise.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s terrifying.</p>
<p>I mean, even without that,</p>
<p>like even some of the, you know,</p>
<p>the nanotech stuff that&rsquo;s coming, I think is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re paying attention,</p>
<p>but actually Eric Weistand came out</p>
<p>with the theory of everything.</p>
<p>I mean, that came out.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been working on a theory of everything</p>
<p>in the physics world called geometric unity.</p>
<p>And then for me, from computer science person like you,</p>
<p>Steven Wolfram&rsquo;s theory of everything,</p>
<p>of like hypergraphs is super interesting and beautiful,</p>
<p>but not from a physics perspective,</p>
<p>but from a computational perspective.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, have you paid attention to any of that?</p>
<p>So again, like what would make me pay attention</p>
<p>and like why like I hate string theory is,</p>
<p>okay, make a testable prediction, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only interested in,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not interested in theories for their intrinsic beauty.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in theories</p>
<p>that give me power over the universe.</p>
<p>So if these theories do, I&rsquo;m very interested.</p>
<p>Can I just say how beautiful that is?</p>
<p>Because a lot of physicists say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in experimental validation</p>
<p>and they skip out the part where they say</p>
<p>to give me more power in the universe.</p>
<p>I just love the.</p>
<p>No, I want. The clarity of that.</p>
<p>I want 100 gigahertz processors.</p>
<p>I want transistors that are smaller than atoms.</p>
<p>I want like power.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where people from aliens</p>
<p>to this kind of technology where people are worried</p>
<p>that governments, like who owns that power?</p>
<p>Is it George Harts?</p>
<p>Is it thousands of distributed hackers across the world?</p>
<p>Is it governments?</p>
<p>Is it Mark Zuckerberg?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people that,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if anyone trusts any one individual with power.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re always worried.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the beauty of blockchains.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the beauty of blockchains, which we&rsquo;ll talk about.</p>
<p>On Twitter, somebody pointed me to a story,</p>
<p>a bunch of people pointed me to a story a few months ago</p>
<p>where you went into a restaurant in New York.</p>
<p>And you can correct me if any of this is wrong.</p>
<p>And ran into a bunch of folks from a company</p>
<p>in a crypto company who are trying to scale up Ethereum.</p>
<p>And they had a technical deadline</p>
<p>related to solidity to OVM compiler.</p>
<p>So these are all Ethereum technologies.</p>
<p>So you stepped in, they recognized you,</p>
<p>pulled you aside, explained their problem.</p>
<p>And you stepped in and helped them solve the problem,</p>
<p>thereby creating legend status story.</p>
<p>So can you tell me the story in a little more detail?</p>
<p>It seems kind of incredible.</p>
<p>Did this happen?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, it&rsquo;s a true story, it&rsquo;s a true story.</p>
<p>I mean, they wrote a very flattering account of it.</p>
<p>So Optimism is the company called Optimism,</p>
<p>spin off of Plasma.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to build L2 solutions on Ethereum.</p>
<p>So right now, every Ethereum node</p>
<p>has to run every transaction on the Ethereum network.</p>
<p>And this kind of doesn&rsquo;t scale, right?</p>
<p>Because if you have N computers,</p>
<p>well, if that becomes two N computers,</p>
<p>you actually still get the same amount of compute, right?</p>
<p>This is like all of one scaling</p>
<p>because they all have to run it.</p>
<p>Okay, fine, you get more blockchain security,</p>
<p>but like, blockchain is already so secure.</p>
<p>Can we trade some of that off for speed?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of what these L2 solutions are.</p>
<p>They built this thing, which kind of,</p>
<p>kind of sandbox for Ethereum contracts.</p>
<p>So they can run it in this L2 world</p>
<p>and it can&rsquo;t do certain things in L world, in L1.</p>
<p>Can I ask you for some definitions?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s L2?</p>
<p>Oh, L2 is layer two.</p>
<p>So L1 is like the base Ethereum chain.</p>
<p>And then layer two is like a computational layer</p>
<p>that runs elsewhere,</p>
<p>but still is kind of secured by layer one.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure a lot of people know,</p>
<p>but Ethereum is a cryptocurrency,</p>
<p>probably one of the most popular cryptocurrency</p>
<p>second to Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And a lot of interesting technological innovation there.</p>
<p>Maybe you could also slip in whenever you talk about this</p>
<p>and things that are exciting to you in the Ethereum space.</p>
<p>And why Ethereum?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, Bitcoin is not Turing complete.</p>
<p>Ethereum is not technically Turing complete</p>
<p>with the gas limit, but close enough.</p>
<p>With the gas limit?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the gas limit, resources?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, no computer is actually Turing complete.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna find out RAM, you know?</p>
<p>I can actually solve the whole thing.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the word gas limit?</p>
<p>You just have so many brilliant words.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even gonna ask.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not my word, that&rsquo;s Ethereum&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>Gas limit.</p>
<p>Ethereum, you have to spend gas per instruction.</p>
<p>So like different op codes use different amounts of gas</p>
<p>and you buy gas with ether to prevent people</p>
<p>from basically DDoSing the network.</p>
<p>So Bitcoin is proof of work.</p>
<p>And then what&rsquo;s Ethereum?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also proof of work.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re working on some proof of stake,</p>
<p>Ethereum 2.0 stuff.</p>
<p>But right now it&rsquo;s proof of work.</p>
<p>It uses a different hash function from Bitcoin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more ASIC resistance, because you need RAM.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re all talking about Ethereum 1.0.</p>
<p>So what were they trying to do to scale this whole process?</p>
<p>So they were like, well, if we could run contracts elsewhere</p>
<p>and then only save the results of that computation,</p>
<p>well, we don&rsquo;t actually have to do the compute on the chain.</p>
<p>We can do the compute off chain</p>
<p>and just post what the results are.</p>
<p>Now, the problem with that is,</p>
<p>well, somebody could lie about what the results are.</p>
<p>So you need a resolution mechanism.</p>
<p>And the resolution mechanism can be really expensive</p>
<p>because you just have to make sure</p>
<p>that the person who is saying,</p>
<p>look, I swear that this is the real computation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m staking $10,000 on that fact.</p>
<p>And if you prove it wrong,</p>
<p>yeah, it might cost you $3,000 in gas fees to prove wrong,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ll get the $10,000 bounty.</p>
<p>So you can secure using those kinds of systems.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s effectively a sandbox, which runs contracts.</p>
<p>And like, it&rsquo;s like any kind of normal sandbox,</p>
<p>you have to like replace syscalls</p>
<p>with calls into the hypervisor.</p>
<p>Sandbox, syscalls, hypervisor.</p>
<p>What do these things mean?</p>
<p>As long as it&rsquo;s interesting to talk about.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you can take like the Chrome sandbox</p>
<p>is maybe the one to think about, right?</p>
<p>So the Chrome process that&rsquo;s doing a rendering,</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t, for example, read a file from the file system.</p>
<p>It has, if it tries to make an open syscall in Linux,</p>
<p>the open syscall, you can&rsquo;t make it open syscall,</p>
<p>no, no, no.</p>
<p>You have to request from the kind of hypervisor process</p>
<p>or like, I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s called in Chrome,</p>
<p>but the, hey, could you open this file for me?</p>
<p>And then it does all these checks</p>
<p>and then it passes the file handle back in</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s approved.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, yeah.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the, in the context of Ethereum,</p>
<p>what are the boundaries of the sandbox</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
<p>Well, like one of the calls that you,</p>
<p>actually reading and writing any state</p>
<p>to the Ethereum contract,</p>
<p>or to the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>Writing state is one of those calls</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to have to sandbox in layer two,</p>
<p>because if you let layer two just arbitrarily write</p>
<p>to the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>So layer two is really sitting on top of layer one.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to have a lot of different kinds of ideas</p>
<p>that you can play with.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re all, they&rsquo;re not fundamentally changing</p>
<p>the source code level of Ethereum.</p>
<p>Well, you have to replace a bunch of calls</p>
<p>with calls into the hypervisor.</p>
<p>So instead of doing the syscall directly,</p>
<p>you replace it with a call to the hypervisor.</p>
<p>So originally they were doing this</p>
<p>by first running the, so Solidity is the language</p>
<p>that most Ethereum contracts are written in.</p>
<p>It compiles to a bytecode.</p>
<p>And then they wrote this thing they called the transpiler.</p>
<p>And the transpiler took the bytecode</p>
<p>and it transpiled it into OVM safe bytecode.</p>
<p>Basically bytecode that didn&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>of those restricted syscalls</p>
<p>and added the calls to the hypervisor.</p>
<p>This transpiler was a 3000 line mess.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to do if you&rsquo;re trying to do it like that,</p>
<p>because you have to kind of like deconstruct the bytecode,</p>
<p>change things about it, and then reconstruct it.</p>
<p>And I mean, as soon as I hear this, I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>well, why don&rsquo;t you just change the compiler, right?</p>
<p>Why not the first place you build the bytecode,</p>
<p>just do it in the compiler.</p>
<p>So yeah, I asked them how much they wanted it.</p>
<p>Of course, measured in dollars and I&rsquo;m like, well, okay.</p>
<p>And yeah.</p>
<p>And you wrote the compiler.</p>
<p>Yeah, I modified, I wrote a 300 line diff to the compiler.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s open source, you can look at it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s, yeah, I looked at the code last night.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Cute is a good word for it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s C++.</p>
<p>C++, yeah.</p>
<p>So when asked how you were able to do it,</p>
<p>you said, you just gotta think and then do it right.</p>
<p>So can you break that apart a little bit?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your process of one, thinking and two, doing it right?</p>
<p>You know, the people that I was working for</p>
<p>were amused that I said that.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really mean anything.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I mean, is there some deep, profound insights</p>
<p>to draw from like how you problem solve from that?</p>
<p>This is always what I say.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, do you wanna be a good programmer?</p>
<p>Do it for 20 years.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s no shortcuts.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on crypto in general?</p>
<p>So what parts technically or philosophically</p>
<p>do you find especially beautiful maybe?</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m extremely bullish on crypto longterm.</p>
<p>Not any specific crypto project, but this idea of,</p>
<p>well, two ideas.</p>
<p>One, the Nakamoto Consensus Algorithm</p>
<p>is I think one of the greatest innovations</p>
<p>of the 21st century.</p>
<p>This idea that people can reach consensus.</p>
<p>You can reach a group consensus.</p>
<p>Using a relatively straightforward algorithm is wild.</p>
<p>And like, you know, Satoshi Nakamoto,</p>
<p>people always ask me who I look up to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, whoever that is.</p>
<p>Who do you think it is?</p>
<p>I mean, Elon Musk?</p>
<p>Is it you?</p>
<p>It is definitely not me.</p>
<p>And I do not think it&rsquo;s Elon Musk.</p>
<p>But yeah, this idea of groups reaching consensus</p>
<p>in a decentralized yet formulaic way</p>
<p>is one extremely powerful idea from crypto.</p>
<p>Maybe the second idea is this idea of smart contracts.</p>
<p>When you write a contract between two parties,</p>
<p>any contract, this contract, if there are disputes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interpreted by lawyers.</p>
<p>Lawyers are just really shitty overpaid interpreters.</p>
<p>Imagine you had, let&rsquo;s talk about them in terms of a,</p>
<p>in terms of like, let&rsquo;s compare a lawyer to Python, right?</p>
<p>So lawyer, well, okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really, I never thought of it that way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>So Python, I&rsquo;m paying even 10 cents an hour.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll use the nice Azure machine.</p>
<p>I can run Python for 10 cents an hour.</p>
<p>Lawyers cost $1,000 an hour.</p>
<p>So Python is 10,000 X better on that axis.</p>
<p>Lawyers don&rsquo;t always return the same answer.</p>
<p>Python almost always does.</p>
<p>Cost.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, just cost, reliability,</p>
<p>everything about Python is so much better than lawyers.</p>
<p>So if you can make smart contracts,</p>
<p>this whole concept of code is law.</p>
<p>I love, and I would love to live in a world</p>
<p>where everybody accepted that fact.</p>
<p>So maybe you can talk about what smart contracts are.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say, let&rsquo;s say, you know,</p>
<p>we have a, even something as simple</p>
<p>as a safety deposit box, right?</p>
<p>Safety deposit box that holds a million dollars.</p>
<p>I have a contract with the bank that says</p>
<p>two out of these three parties must be present</p>
<p>to open the safety deposit box and get the money out.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a contract for the bank,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s only as good as the bank and the lawyers, right?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say, you know, somebody dies and now,</p>
<p>oh, we&rsquo;re gonna go through a big legal dispute</p>
<p>about whether, oh, well, was it in the will,</p>
<p>was it not in the will?</p>
<p>What, like, it&rsquo;s just so messy,</p>
<p>and the cost to determine truth is so expensive.</p>
<p>Versus a smart contract, which just uses cryptography</p>
<p>to check if two out of three keys are present.</p>
<p>Well, I can look at that, and I can have certainty</p>
<p>in the answer that it&rsquo;s going to return.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what, all businesses want is certainty.</p>
<p>You know, they say businesses don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Viacom, YouTube, YouTube&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>look, we don&rsquo;t care which way this lawsuit goes.</p>
<p>Just please tell us so we can have certainty.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wonder how many agreements in this,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re talking about financial transactions only</p>
<p>in this case, correct, the smart contracts?</p>
<p>Oh, you can go to anything.</p>
<p>You can put a prenup in the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>A married smart contract?</p>
<p>Sorry, divorce lawyer, sorry.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be replaced by Python.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s another beautiful idea.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s appealing to you</p>
<p>about any one specific implementation?</p>
<p>So if you look 10, 20, 50 years down the line,</p>
<p>do you see any, like, Bitcoin, Ethereum,</p>
<p>any of the other hundreds of cryptocurrencies winning out?</p>
<p>Is there, like, what&rsquo;s your intuition about the space?</p>
<p>Or are you just sitting back and watching the chaos</p>
<p>and look who cares what emerges?</p>
<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t speculate.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really care.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really care which one of these projects wins.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of in the Bitcoin as a meme coin camp.</p>
<p>I mean, why does Bitcoin have value?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s technically kind of, you know,</p>
<p>not great, like the block size debate.</p>
<p>When I found out what the block size debate was,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, are you guys kidding?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the block size debate?</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, it&rsquo;s too stupid to even talk.</p>
<p>People can look it up, but I&rsquo;m like, wow.</p>
<p>You know, Ethereum seems,</p>
<p>the governance of Ethereum seems much better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come around a bit on proof of stake ideas.</p>
<p>You know, very smart people thinking about some things.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, governance is interesting.</p>
<p>It does feel like Vitalik,</p>
<p>like it does feel like an open,</p>
<p>even in these distributed systems,</p>
<p>leaders are helpful</p>
<p>because they kind of help you drive the mission</p>
<p>and the vision and they put a face to a project.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a weird thing about us humans.</p>
<p>Geniuses are helpful, like Vitalik.</p>
<p>Yeah, brilliant.</p>
<p>Leaders are not necessarily, yeah.</p>
<p>So you think the reason he&rsquo;s the face of Ethereum</p>
<p>is because he&rsquo;s a genius.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, that was,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting to think about</p>
<p>that we need to create systems</p>
<p>in which the quote unquote leaders that emerge</p>
<p>are the geniuses in the system.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s arguably why</p>
<p>the current state of democracy is broken</p>
<p>is the people who are emerging as the leaders</p>
<p>are not the most competent,</p>
<p>are not the superstars of the system.</p>
<p>And it seems like at least for now</p>
<p>in the crypto world oftentimes</p>
<p>the leaders are the superstars.</p>
<p>Imagine at the debate they asked,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the sixth amendment?</p>
<p>What are the four fundamental forces in the universe?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the integral of two to the X?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see those questions asked</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what I want as our leader.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s Bayes rule?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, even, oh wow, you&rsquo;re hurting my brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that my standard was even lower</p>
<p>but I would have loved to see</p>
<p>just this basic brilliance.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve talked to historians.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just these, they&rsquo;re not even like</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have a PhD or even education history.</p>
<p>They just like a Dan Carlin type character</p>
<p>who just like, holy shit.</p>
<p>How did all this information get into your head?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re able to just connect Genghis Khan</p>
<p>to the entirety of the history of the 20th century.</p>
<p>They know everything about every single battle that happened</p>
<p>and they know the game of Thrones</p>
<p>of the different power plays and all that happened there.</p>
<p>And they know like the individuals</p>
<p>and all the documents involved</p>
<p>and they integrate that into their regular life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re ultra history nerds.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just, they know this information.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what competence looks like.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;ve seen that with programmers too, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what great programmers do.</p>
<p>But yeah, it would be, it&rsquo;s really unfortunate</p>
<p>that those kinds of people aren&rsquo;t emerging as our leaders.</p>
<p>But for now, at least in the crypto world</p>
<p>that seems to be the case.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that always, you could imagine</p>
<p>that in a hundred years, it&rsquo;s not the case, right?</p>
<p>Crypto world has one very powerful idea going for it</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the idea of forks, right?</p>
<p>I mean, imagine, we&rsquo;ll use a less controversial example.</p>
<p>This was actually in my joke app in 2012.</p>
<p>I was like, Barack Obama, Mitt Romney,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s let them both be president, right?</p>
<p>Like imagine we could fork America</p>
<p>and just let them both be president.</p>
<p>And then the Americas could compete</p>
<p>and people could invest in one,</p>
<p>pull their liquidity out of one, put it in the other.</p>
<p>You have this in the crypto world.</p>
<p>Ethereum forks into Ethereum and Ethereum classic.</p>
<p>And you can pull your liquidity out of one</p>
<p>and put it in another.</p>
<p>And people vote with their dollars,</p>
<p>which forks, companies should be able to fork.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to fork Nvidia, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, like different business strategies</p>
<p>and then try them out and see what works.</p>
<p>Like even take, yeah, take comma AI that closes its source</p>
<p>and then take one that&rsquo;s open source and see what works.</p>
<p>Take one that&rsquo;s purchased by GM</p>
<p>and one that remains Android Renegade</p>
<p>and all these different versions and see.</p>
<p>The beauty of comma AI is someone can actually do that.</p>
<p>Please take comma AI and fork it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s the beauty of open source.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re, I mean, we&rsquo;ll talk about autonomous vehicle space,</p>
<p>but it does seem that you&rsquo;re really knowledgeable</p>
<p>about a lot of different topics.</p>
<p>So the natural question a bunch of people ask this,</p>
<p>which is how do you keep learning new things?</p>
<p>Do you have like practical advice</p>
<p>if you were to introspect, like taking notes,</p>
<p>allocate time, or do you just mess around</p>
<p>and just allow your curiosity to drive?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll write these people a self help book</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll charge $67 for it.</p>
<p>And I will write, I will write,</p>
<p>I will write on the cover of the self help book.</p>
<p>All of this advice is completely meaningless.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be a sucker and buy this book anyway.</p>
<p>And the one lesson that I hope they take away from the book</p>
<p>is that I can&rsquo;t give you a meaningful answer to that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Let me translate that.</p>
<p>Is you haven&rsquo;t really thought about what it is you do</p>
<p>systematically because you could reduce it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some people, I mean, I&rsquo;ve met brilliant people</p>
<p>that this is really clear with athletes.</p>
<p>Some are just, you know, the best in the world</p>
<p>at something and they have zero interest</p>
<p>in writing like a self help book,</p>
<p>or how to master this game.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s some athletes who become great coaches</p>
<p>and they love the analysis, perhaps the over analysis.</p>
<p>And you right now, at least at your age,</p>
<p>which is an interesting, you&rsquo;re in the middle of the battle.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like the warriors that have zero interest</p>
<p>in writing books.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re in the middle of the battle.</p>
<p>So you have, yeah.</p>
<p>This is a fair point.</p>
<p>I do think I have a certain aversion</p>
<p>to this kind of deliberate intentional way of living life.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re eventually, the hilarity of this,</p>
<p>especially since this is recorded,</p>
<p>it will reveal beautifully the absurdity</p>
<p>when you finally do publish this book.</p>
<p>I guarantee you, you will.</p>
<p>The story of comma AI, maybe it&rsquo;ll be a biography</p>
<p>written about you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll be better, I guess.</p>
<p>And you might be able to learn some cute lessons</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re starting a company like comma AI from that book.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re asking generic questions,</p>
<p>like how do I be good at things?</p>
<p>How do I be good at things?</p>
<p>Dude, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Do them a lot.</p>
<p>But the interesting thing here is learning things</p>
<p>outside of your current trajectory,</p>
<p>which is what it feels like from an outsider&rsquo;s perspective.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s advice on that,</p>
<p>but it is an interesting curiosity.</p>
<p>When you become really busy, you&rsquo;re running a company.</p>
<p>Hard time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a natural inclination and trend.</p>
<p>Just the momentum of life carries you</p>
<p>into a particular direction of wanting to focus.</p>
<p>And this kind of dispersion that curiosity can lead to</p>
<p>gets harder and harder with time.</p>
<p>Because you get really good at certain things</p>
<p>and it sucks trying things that you&rsquo;re not good at,</p>
<p>like trying to figure them out.</p>
<p>When you do this with your live streams,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the fly figuring stuff out.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t mind looking dumb.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You just figure it out pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Sometimes I try things and I don&rsquo;t figure them out quickly.</p>
<p>My chest rating is like a 1400,</p>
<p>despite putting like a couple of hundred hours in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pathetic.</p>
<p>I mean, to be fair, I know that I could do it better</p>
<p>if I did it better.</p>
<p>Like don&rsquo;t play five minute games,</p>
<p>play 15 minute games at least.</p>
<p>Like I know these things, but it just doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t stick nicely in my knowledge stream.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s talk about Comma AI.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the mission of the company?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s like look at the biggest picture.</p>
<p>Oh, I have an exact statement.</p>
<p>Solve self driving cars</p>
<p>while delivering shippable intermediaries.</p>
<p>So longterm vision is have fully autonomous vehicles</p>
<p>and make sure you&rsquo;re making money along the way.</p>
<p>I think it doesn&rsquo;t really speak to money,</p>
<p>but I can talk about what solve self driving cars means.</p>
<p>Solve self driving cars of course means</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not building a new car,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re building a person replacement.</p>
<p>That person can sit in the driver&rsquo;s seat</p>
<p>and drive you anywhere a person can drive</p>
<p>with a human or better level of safety,</p>
<p>speed, quality, comfort.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the second part of that?</p>
<p>Delivering shippable intermediaries is well,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a way to fund the company, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also a way to keep us honest.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have that, it is very easy</p>
<p>with this technology to think you&rsquo;re making progress</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard it best described on Hacker News as</p>
<p>you can set any arbitrary milestone,</p>
<p>meet that milestone and still be infinitely far away</p>
<p>from solving self driving cars.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard to have like real deadlines</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re like Cruz or Waymo when you don&rsquo;t have revenue.</p>
<p>Is that, I mean, is revenue essentially</p>
<p>the thing we&rsquo;re talking about here?</p>
<p>Revenue is, capitalism is based around consent.</p>
<p>Capitalism, the way that you get revenue</p>
<p>is real capitalism comes in the real capitalism camp.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely scams out there,</p>
<p>but real capitalism is based around consent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s based around this idea that like,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re getting revenue, it&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re providing</p>
<p>at least that much value to another person.</p>
<p>When someone buys $1,000 comma two from us,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re providing them at least $1,000 of value</p>
<p>or they wouldn&rsquo;t buy it.</p>
<p>Brilliant, so can you give a whirlwind overview</p>
<p>of the products that Comma AI provides,</p>
<p>like throughout its history and today?</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, the past ones aren&rsquo;t really that interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of just been refinement of the same idea.</p>
<p>The real only product we sell today is the Comma 2.</p>
<p>Which is a piece of hardware with cameras.</p>
<p>Mm, so the Comma 2, I mean, you can think about it</p>
<p>kind of like a person.</p>
<p>Future hardware will probably be</p>
<p>even more and more personlike.</p>
<p>So it has eyes, ears, a mouth, a brain,</p>
<p>and a way to interface with the car.</p>
<p>Does it have consciousness?</p>
<p>Just kidding, that was a trick question.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have consciousness either.</p>
<p>Me and the Comma 2 are the same.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the same?</p>
<p>I have a little more compute than it.</p>
<p>It only has like the same compute as a B, you know.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re more efficient energy wise</p>
<p>for the compute you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Far more efficient energy wise.</p>
<p>20 petaflops, 20 watts, crazy.</p>
<p>Do you lack consciousness?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Do you fear death?</p>
<p>You do, you want immortality.</p>
<p>Of course I fear death.</p>
<p>Does Comma AI fear death?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>Of course it does.</p>
<p>It very much fears, well, it fears negative loss.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so Comma 2, when did that come out?</p>
<p>That was a year ago?</p>
<p>No, two.</p>
<p>Early this year.</p>
<p>Wow, time, it feels like, yeah.</p>
<p>2020 feels like it&rsquo;s taken 10 years to get to the end.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long year.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the sexiest thing about Comma 2 feature wise?</p>
<p>So, I mean, maybe you can also link on like, what is it?</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s its purpose?</p>
<p>Cause there&rsquo;s a hardware, there&rsquo;s a software component.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned the sensors,</p>
<p>but also like what is it, its features and capabilities?</p>
<p>I think our slogan summarizes it well.</p>
<p>Comma slogan is make driving chill.</p>
<p>I love it, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it is, you know,</p>
<p>if you like cruise control, imagine cruise control,</p>
<p>but much, much more.</p>
<p>So it can do adaptive cruise control things,</p>
<p>which is like slow down for cars in front of it,</p>
<p>maintain a certain speed.</p>
<p>And it can also do lane keeping.</p>
<p>So staying in the lane and doing it better</p>
<p>and better and better over time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very much machine learning based.</p>
<p>So this camera is, there&rsquo;s a driver facing camera too.</p>
<p>What else is there?</p>
<p>What am I thinking?</p>
<p>So the hardware versus software.</p>
<p>So open pilot versus the actual hardware of the device.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s, can you draw that distinction?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s one, what&rsquo;s the other?</p>
<p>I mean, the hardware is pretty much a cell phone</p>
<p>with a few additions.</p>
<p>A cell phone with a cooling system</p>
<p>and with a car interface connected to it.</p>
<p>And by cell phone, you mean like Qualcomm Snapdragon.</p>
<p>Yeah, the current hardware is a Snapdragon 821.</p>
<p>It has wifi radio, it has an LTE radio, it has a screen.</p>
<p>We use every part of the cell phone.</p>
<p>And then the interface with the car</p>
<p>is specific to the car.</p>
<p>So you keep supporting more and more cars.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the interface to the car,</p>
<p>I mean, the device itself just has four CAN buses.</p>
<p>It has four CAN interfaces on it</p>
<p>that are connected through the USB port to the phone.</p>
<p>And then, yeah, on those four CAN buses,</p>
<p>you connect it to the car.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a little harness to do this.</p>
<p>Cars are actually surprisingly similar.</p>
<p>So CAN is the protocol by which cars communicate.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re able to read stuff and write stuff</p>
<p>to be able to control the car depending on the car.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the software side?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s OpenPilot?</p>
<p>So I mean, OpenPilot is,</p>
<p>the hardware is pretty simple compared to OpenPilot.</p>
<p>OpenPilot is, well, so you have a machine learning model,</p>
<p>which it&rsquo;s in OpenPilot, it&rsquo;s a blob.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a blob of weights.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like people are like, oh, it&rsquo;s closed source.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, it&rsquo;s a blob of weights.</p>
<p>What do you expect?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s primarily neural network based.</p>
<p>You, well, OpenPilot is all the software</p>
<p>kind of around that neural network.</p>
<p>That if you have a neural network that says,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s where you wanna send the car,</p>
<p>OpenPilot actually goes and executes all of that.</p>
<p>It cleans up the input to the neural network.</p>
<p>It cleans up the output and executes on it.</p>
<p>So it connects, it&rsquo;s the glue</p>
<p>that connects everything together.</p>
<p>Runs the sensors, does a bunch of calibration</p>
<p>for the neural network, deals with like,</p>
<p>if the car is on a banked road,</p>
<p>you have to counter steer against that.</p>
<p>And the neural network can&rsquo;t necessarily know that</p>
<p>by looking at the picture.</p>
<p>So you do that with other sensors</p>
<p>and Fusion and Localizer.</p>
<p>OpenPilot also is responsible</p>
<p>for sending the data up to our servers.</p>
<p>So we can learn from it, logging it, recording it,</p>
<p>running the cameras, thermally managing the device,</p>
<p>managing the disk space on the device,</p>
<p>managing all the resources on the device.</p>
<p>So what, since we last spoke,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember when, maybe a year ago,</p>
<p>maybe a little bit longer,</p>
<p>how has OpenPilot improved?</p>
<p>We did exactly what I promised you.</p>
<p>I promised you that by the end of the year,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;d be able to remove the lanes.</p>
<p>The lateral policy is now almost completely end to end.</p>
<p>You can turn the lanes off and it will drive,</p>
<p>drive slightly worse on the highway</p>
<p>if you turn the lanes off,</p>
<p>but you can turn the lanes off and it will drive well,</p>
<p>trained completely end to end on user data.</p>
<p>And this year we hope to do the same</p>
<p>for the longitudinal policy.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the interesting thing is you&rsquo;re not doing,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t appear to be, maybe you can correct me,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t appear to be doing lane detection</p>
<p>or lane marking detection or kind of the segmentation task</p>
<p>or any kind of object detection task.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing what&rsquo;s traditionally more called</p>
<p>like end to end learning.</p>
<p>So, and trained on actual behavior of drivers</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re driving the car manually.</p>
<p>And this is hard to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not supervised learning.</p>
<p>Yeah, but so the nice thing is there&rsquo;s a lot of data.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard and easy, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>We have a lot of high quality data, yeah.</p>
<p>Like more than you need in the second.</p>
<p>Well&hellip;</p>
<p>We have way more than we do.</p>
<p>We have way more data than we need.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s an interesting question actually,</p>
<p>because in terms of amount, you have more than you need,</p>
<p>but the driving is full of edge cases.</p>
<p>So how do you select the data you train on?</p>
<p>I think this is an interesting open question.</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s the cleverest way to select data?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the question Tesla is probably working on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, I mean, the entirety of machine learning can be,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t seem to really care.</p>
<p>They just kind of select data.</p>
<p>But I feel like that if you want to solve,</p>
<p>if you want to create intelligent systems,</p>
<p>you have to pick data well, right?</p>
<p>And so do you have any hints, ideas of how to do it well?</p>
<p>So in some ways that is&hellip;</p>
<p>The definition I like of reinforcement learning</p>
<p>versus supervised learning.</p>
<p>In supervised learning, the weights depend on the data.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And this is obviously true,</p>
<p>but in reinforcement learning,</p>
<p>the data depends on the weights.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And actually both ways.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s poetry.</p>
<p>So how does it know what data to train on?</p>
<p>Well, let it pick.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not there yet, but that&rsquo;s the eventual.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re thinking this almost like</p>
<p>a reinforcement learning framework.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to do RL on the world.</p>
<p>Every time a car makes a mistake, user disengages,</p>
<p>we train on that and do RL on the world.</p>
<p>Ship out a new model, that&rsquo;s an epoch, right?</p>
<p>And for now you&rsquo;re not doing the Elon style promising</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s going to be fully autonomous.</p>
<p>You really are sticking to level two</p>
<p>and like it&rsquo;s supposed to be supervised.</p>
<p>It is definitely supposed to be supervised</p>
<p>and we enforce the fact that it&rsquo;s supervised.</p>
<p>We look at our rate of improvement in disengagements.</p>
<p>OpenPilot now has an unplanned disengagement</p>
<p>about every a hundred miles.</p>
<p>This is up from 10 miles, like maybe,</p>
<p>maybe maybe a year ago.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So maybe we&rsquo;ve seen 10 X improvement in a year,</p>
<p>but a hundred miles is still a far cry</p>
<p>from the a hundred thousand you&rsquo;re going to need.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to somehow need to get three more 10 Xs</p>
<p>in there.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re, what&rsquo;s your intuition?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re basically hoping that there&rsquo;s exponential</p>
<p>improvement built into the baked into the cake somewhere.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s even, I mean, 10 X improvement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s already assuming exponential, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely exponential improvement.</p>
<p>And I think when Elon talks about exponential,</p>
<p>like these things, these systems are going to</p>
<p>exponentially improve, just exponential doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting a hundred gigahertz processors tomorrow.</p>
<p>Right? Like it&rsquo;s going to still take a while</p>
<p>because the gap between even our best system</p>
<p>and humans is still large.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an interesting distinction to draw.</p>
<p>So if you look at the way Tesla is approaching the problem</p>
<p>and the way you&rsquo;re approaching the problem,</p>
<p>which is very different than the rest of the self driving</p>
<p>car world.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s put them aside is you&rsquo;re treating most</p>
<p>the driving task as a machine learning problem.</p>
<p>And the way Tesla is approaching it is with the multitask</p>
<p>learning where you break the task of driving into hundreds</p>
<p>of different tasks and you have this multiheaded</p>
<p>neural network that&rsquo;s very good at performing each task.</p>
<p>And there there&rsquo;s presumably something on top that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stitching stuff together in order to make control</p>
<p>decisions, policy decisions about how you move the car.</p>
<p>But what that allows you, there&rsquo;s a brilliance to this</p>
<p>because it allows you to master each task,</p>
<p>like lane detection, stop sign detection,</p>
<p>the traffic light detection, drivable area segmentation,</p>
<p>you know, vehicle, bicycle, pedestrian detection.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some localization tasks in there.</p>
<p>Also predicting of like, yeah,</p>
<p>predicting how the entities in the scene are going to move.</p>
<p>Like everything is basically a machine learning task.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a classification, segmentation, prediction.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s nice because you can have this entire engine,</p>
<p>data engine that&rsquo;s mining for edge cases for each one of</p>
<p>these tasks.</p>
<p>And you can have people like engineers that are basically</p>
<p>masters of that task,</p>
<p>like become the best person in the world at,</p>
<p>as you talk about the cone guy for Waymo,</p>
<p>the becoming the best person in the world at cone detection.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a compelling notion from a supervised learning</p>
<p>perspective, automating much of the process of edge case</p>
<p>discovery and retraining neural network for each of the</p>
<p>individual perception tasks.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re looking at the machine learning in a more</p>
<p>holistic way, basically doing end to end learning on the</p>
<p>driving tasks, supervised, trained on the data of the</p>
<p>actual driving of people.</p>
<p>They use comma AI, like actual human drivers,</p>
<p>their manual control,</p>
<p>plus the moments of disengagement that maybe with some</p>
<p>labeling could indicate the failure of the system.</p>
<p>So you have the,</p>
<p>you have a huge amount of data for positive control of the</p>
<p>vehicle, like successful control of the vehicle,</p>
<p>both maintaining the lane as,</p>
<p>as I think you&rsquo;re also working on longitudinal control of</p>
<p>the vehicle and then failure cases where the vehicle does</p>
<p>something wrong that needs disengagement.</p>
<p>So like what,</p>
<p>why do you think you&rsquo;re right and Tesla is wrong on this?</p>
<p>And do you think,</p>
<p>do you think you&rsquo;ll come around the Tesla way?</p>
<p>Do you think Tesla will come around to your way?</p>
<p>If you were to start a chess engine company,</p>
<p>would you hire a Bishop guy?</p>
<p>See, we have a,</p>
<p>this is Monday morning.</p>
<p>Quarterbacking is a yes, probably.</p>
<p>Oh, our Rook guy.</p>
<p>Oh, we stole the Rook guy from that company.</p>
<p>Oh, we&rsquo;re going to have real good Rooks.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s not many pieces, right?</p>
<p>You can,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not many guys and gals to hire.</p>
<p>You just have a few that work in the Bishop,</p>
<p>a few that work in the Rook.</p>
<p>Is that not ludicrous today to think about</p>
<p>in a world of AlphaZero?</p>
<p>But AlphaZero is a chess game.</p>
<p>So the fundamental question is,</p>
<p>how hard is driving compared to chess?</p>
<p>Because, so long term,</p>
<p>end to end,</p>
<p>will be the right solution.</p>
<p>The question is how many years away is that?</p>
<p>End to end is going to be the only solution for level five.</p>
<p>For the only way we&rsquo;ll get there.</p>
<p>Of course, and of course,</p>
<p>Tesla is going to come around to my way.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re a Rook guy out there, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>The cone guy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to specialize each task.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to really understand Rook placement.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I understand the intuition you have.</p>
<p>I mean, that,</p>
<p>that is a very compelling notion</p>
<p>that we can learn the task end to end,</p>
<p>like the same compelling notion you might have</p>
<p>for natural language conversation.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>sure,</p>
<p>because one thing you sneaked in there</p>
<p>is the assertion that it&rsquo;s impossible to get to level five</p>
<p>without this kind of approach.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s obvious.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s obvious either.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually mean that.</p>
<p>I think that it is much easier</p>
<p>to get to level five with an end to end approach.</p>
<p>I think that the other approach is doable,</p>
<p>but the magnitude of the engineering challenge</p>
<p>may exceed what humanity is capable of.</p>
<p>But what do you think of the Tesla data engine approach,</p>
<p>which to me is an active learning task,</p>
<p>is kind of fascinating,</p>
<p>is breaking it down into these multiple tasks</p>
<p>and mining their data constantly for like edge cases</p>
<p>for these different tasks.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the tasks themselves are not being learned.</p>
<p>This is feature engineering.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s a higher abstraction level</p>
<p>of feature engineering for the different tasks.</p>
<p>Task engineering in a sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s slightly better feature engineering,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still fundamentally is feature engineering.</p>
<p>And if anything about the history of AI</p>
<p>has taught us anything,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that feature engineering approaches</p>
<p>will always be replaced and lose to end to end.</p>
<p>Now, to be fair, I cannot really make promises on timelines,</p>
<p>but I can say that when you look at the code for Stockfish</p>
<p>and the code for AlphaZero,</p>
<p>one is a lot shorter than the other,</p>
<p>a lot more elegant,</p>
<p>required a lot less programmer hours to write.</p>
<p>Yeah, but there was a lot more murder of bad agents</p>
<p>on the AlphaZero side.</p>
<p>By murder, I mean agents that played a game</p>
<p>and failed miserably.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, oh.</p>
<p>In simulation, that failure is less costly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In real world, it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Do you mean in practice,</p>
<p>like AlphaZero has lost games miserably?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen that.</p>
<p>No, but I know, but the requirement for AlphaZero is&hellip;</p>
<p>A simulator.</p>
<p>To be able to like evolution, human evolution,</p>
<p>not human evolution, biological evolution of life on earth</p>
<p>from the origin of life has murdered trillions</p>
<p>upon trillions of organisms on the path thus humans.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the question is, can we stitch together</p>
<p>a human like object without having to go</p>
<p>through the entirety process of evolution?</p>
<p>Well, no, but do the evolution in simulation.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the question.</p>
<p>Can we simulate?</p>
<p>So do you have a sense that it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>to simulate some aspect?</p>
<p>MuZero is exactly this.</p>
<p>MuZero is the solution to this.</p>
<p>MuZero I think is going to be looked back</p>
<p>as the canonical paper.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think deep learning is everything.</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s still a bunch of things missing</p>
<p>to get there, but MuZero I think is going to be looked back</p>
<p>as the kind of cornerstone paper</p>
<p>of this whole deep learning era.</p>
<p>And MuZero is the solution to self driving cars.</p>
<p>You have to make a few tweaks to it,</p>
<p>but MuZero does effectively that.</p>
<p>It does those rollouts and those murdering</p>
<p>in a learned simulator and a learned dynamics model.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t get enough love.</p>
<p>I was blown away when I read that paper.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay, I&rsquo;ve always said a comma.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to sit and I&rsquo;m going to wait for the solution</p>
<p>to self driving cars to come along.</p>
<p>This year I saw it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s MuZero.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Sit back and let the winning roll in.</p>
<p>So your sense, just to elaborate a little bit,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a link on the topic.</p>
<p>Your sense is neural networks will solve driving.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Like we don&rsquo;t need anything else.</p>
<p>I think the same way chess was maybe the chess</p>
<p>and maybe Google are the pinnacle of like search algorithms</p>
<p>and things that look kind of like a star.</p>
<p>The pinnacle of this era is going to be self driving cars.</p>
<p>But on the path of that, you have to deliver products</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s possible that the path to full self driving cars</p>
<p>will take decades.</p>
<p>I doubt it.</p>
<p>How long would you put on it?</p>
<p>Like what are we, you&rsquo;re chasing it, Tesla&rsquo;s chasing it.</p>
<p>What are we talking about?</p>
<p>Five years, 10 years, 50 years.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say in the 2020s.</p>
<p>In the 2020s.</p>
<p>The later part of the 2020s.</p>
<p>With the neural network.</p>
<p>Well, that would be nice to see.</p>
<p>And then the path to that, you&rsquo;re delivering products,</p>
<p>which is a nice L2 system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Tesla&rsquo;s doing, a nice L2 system.</p>
<p>Just gets better every time.</p>
<p>L2, the only difference between L2 and the other levels</p>
<p>is who takes liability.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not a liability guy, I don&rsquo;t wanna take liability.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna level two forever.</p>
<p>Now on that little transition,</p>
<p>I mean, how do you make the transition work?</p>
<p>Is this where driver sensing comes in?</p>
<p>Like how do you make the, cause you said a hundred miles,</p>
<p>like, is there some sort of human factor psychology thing</p>
<p>where people start to overtrust the system,</p>
<p>all those kinds of effects,</p>
<p>once it gets better and better and better and better,</p>
<p>they get lazier and lazier and lazier.</p>
<p>Is that, like, how do you get that transition right?</p>
<p>First off, our monitoring is already adaptive.</p>
<p>Our monitoring is already seen adaptive.</p>
<p>Driver monitoring is just the camera</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s looking at the driver.</p>
<p>You have an infrared camera in the&hellip;</p>
<p>Our policy for how we enforce the driver monitoring</p>
<p>is seen adaptive.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that mean?</p>
<p>Well, for example, in one of the extreme cases,</p>
<p>if the car is not moving,</p>
<p>we do not actively enforce driver monitoring, right?</p>
<p>If you are going through a,</p>
<p>like a 45 mile an hour road with lights</p>
<p>and stop signs and potentially pedestrians,</p>
<p>we enforce a very tight driver monitoring policy.</p>
<p>If you are alone on a perfectly straight highway,</p>
<p>and this is, it&rsquo;s all machine learning.</p>
<p>None of that is hand coded.</p>
<p>Actually, the stop is hand coded, but&hellip;</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some kind of machine learning</p>
<p>estimation of risk.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve always been a huge fan of that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>Because&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to do every step into that direction</p>
<p>is a worthwhile step to take.</p>
<p>It might be difficult to do really well.</p>
<p>Like us humans are able to estimate risk pretty damn well,</p>
<p>whatever the hell that is.</p>
<p>That feels like one of the nice features of us humans.</p>
<p>Cause like we humans are really good drivers</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re really like tuned in</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re good at estimating risk.</p>
<p>Like when are we supposed to be tuned in?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And, you know, people are like,</p>
<p>oh, well, you know,</p>
<p>why would you ever make the driver monitoring policy</p>
<p>less aggressive?</p>
<p>Why would you always not keep it at its most aggressive?</p>
<p>Because then people are just going to get fatigued from it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>When they get annoyed.</p>
<p>You want them&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You want the experience to be pleasant.</p>
<p>Obviously I want the experience to be pleasant,</p>
<p>but even just from a straight up safety perspective,</p>
<p>if you alert people when they look around and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>why is this thing alerting me?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing I could possibly hit right now.</p>
<p>People will just learn to tune it out.</p>
<p>People will just learn to tune it out,</p>
<p>to put weights on the steering wheel,</p>
<p>to do whatever to overcome it.</p>
<p>And remember that you&rsquo;re always part</p>
<p>of this adaptive system.</p>
<p>So all I can really say about, you know,</p>
<p>how this scales going forward is yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something we have to monitor for.</p>
<p>Ooh, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>This is a great psychology experiment at scale.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Track it.</p>
<p>And making sure you have a good understanding of attention</p>
<p>is a very key part of that psychology problem.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think you and I probably have a different,</p>
<p>come to it differently, but to me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fascinating psychology problem</p>
<p>to explore something much deeper than just driving.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a nice way to explore human attention</p>
<p>and human behavior, which is why, again,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve probably both criticized Mr. Elon Musk</p>
<p>on this one topic from different avenues.</p>
<p>So both offline and online,</p>
<p>I had little chats with Elon and like,</p>
<p>I love human beings as a computer vision problem,</p>
<p>as an AI problem, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t so much interested in that problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like in order to solve driving,</p>
<p>the whole point is you want to remove the human</p>
<p>from the picture.</p>
<p>And it seems like you can&rsquo;t do that quite yet.</p>
<p>Eventually, yes, but you can&rsquo;t quite do that yet.</p>
<p>So this is the moment where you can&rsquo;t yet say,</p>
<p>I told you so to Tesla, but it&rsquo;s getting there</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve seen this,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some reporting that they&rsquo;re in fact</p>
<p>starting to do driver monitoring.</p>
<p>Yeah, they shift the model in shadow mode.</p>
<p>With, I believe, only a visible light camera,</p>
<p>it might even be fisheye.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a low resolution.</p>
<p>Low resolution, visible light.</p>
<p>I mean, to be fair, that&rsquo;s what we have in the Eon as well,</p>
<p>our last generation product.</p>
<p>This is the one area where I can say</p>
<p>our hardware is ahead of Tesla.</p>
<p>The rest of our hardware, way, way behind,</p>
<p>but our driver monitoring camera.</p>
<p>So you think, I think on the third row Tesla podcast,</p>
<p>or somewhere else, I&rsquo;ve heard you say that obviously,</p>
<p>eventually they&rsquo;re gonna have driver monitoring.</p>
<p>I think what I&rsquo;ve said is Elon will definitely ship</p>
<p>driver monitoring before he ships level five.</p>
<p>Before level five.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m willing to bet 10 grand on that.</p>
<p>And you bet 10 grand on that.</p>
<p>I mean, now I don&rsquo;t wanna take the bet,</p>
<p>but before, maybe someone would have,</p>
<p>oh, I should have got my money in.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting bet.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually on a human level</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s been, he&rsquo;s made the decision.</p>
<p>Like he said that driver monitoring is the wrong way to go.</p>
<p>But like, you have to think of as a human, as a CEO,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the right thing to say when,</p>
<p>like sometimes you have to say things publicly</p>
<p>that are different than when you actually believe,</p>
<p>because when you&rsquo;re producing a large number of vehicles</p>
<p>and the decision was made not to include the camera,</p>
<p>like what are you supposed to say?</p>
<p>Like our cars don&rsquo;t have the thing</p>
<p>that I think is right to have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting thing.</p>
<p>But like on the other side, as a CEO,</p>
<p>I mean, something you could probably speak to as a leader,</p>
<p>I think about me as a human</p>
<p>to publicly change your mind on something.</p>
<p>How hard is that?</p>
<p>Especially when assholes like George Haas say,</p>
<p>I told you so.</p>
<p>All I will say is I am not a leader</p>
<p>and I am happy to change my mind.</p>
<p>And I will.</p>
<p>You think Elon will?</p>
<p>Yeah, I do.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;ll come up with a good way</p>
<p>to make it psychologically okay for him.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s such an important thing, man.</p>
<p>Especially for a first principles thinker,</p>
<p>because he made a decision that driver monitoring</p>
<p>is not the right way to go.</p>
<p>And I could see that decision.</p>
<p>And I could even make that decision.</p>
<p>Like I was on the fence too.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not a,</p>
<p>driver monitoring is such an obvious,</p>
<p>simple solution to the problem of attention.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not obvious to me that just by putting a camera there,</p>
<p>you solve things.</p>
<p>You have to create an incredible, compelling experience.</p>
<p>Just like you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s easy to do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not at all easy to do that, in fact, I think.</p>
<p>So as a creator of a car that&rsquo;s trying to create a product</p>
<p>that people love, which is what Tesla tries to do, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not obvious to me that as a design decision,</p>
<p>whether adding a camera is a good idea.</p>
<p>From a safety perspective either,</p>
<p>like in the human factors community,</p>
<p>everybody says that you should obviously</p>
<p>have driver sensing, driver monitoring.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s like saying it&rsquo;s obvious as parents,</p>
<p>you shouldn&rsquo;t let your kids go out at night.</p>
<p>But okay, but like,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re still gonna find ways to do drugs.</p>
<p>Like, you have to also be good parents.</p>
<p>So like, it&rsquo;s much more complicated than just the,</p>
<p>you need to have driver monitoring.</p>
<p>I totally disagree on, okay, if you have a camera there</p>
<p>and the camera&rsquo;s watching the person,</p>
<p>but never throws an alert, they&rsquo;ll never think about it.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>The driver monitoring policy that you choose to,</p>
<p>how you choose to communicate with the user</p>
<p>is entirely separate from the data collection perspective.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So, you know, like, there&rsquo;s one thing to say,</p>
<p>like, you know, tell your teenager they can&rsquo;t do something.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another thing to like, you know, gather the data.</p>
<p>So you can make informed decisions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>But you have to make that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the interesting thing about cars.</p>
<p>But even true with common AI,</p>
<p>like you don&rsquo;t have to manufacture the thing</p>
<p>into the car, is you have to make a decision</p>
<p>that anticipates the right strategy longterm.</p>
<p>So like, you have to start collecting the data</p>
<p>and start making decisions.</p>
<p>Started it three years ago.</p>
<p>I believe that we have the best driver monitoring solution</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>I think that when you compare it to Super Cruise</p>
<p>is the only other one that I really know that shipped.</p>
<p>And ours is better.</p>
<p>What do you like and not like about Super Cruise?</p>
<p>I mean, I had a few Super Cruise,</p>
<p>the sun would be shining through the window,</p>
<p>would blind the camera,</p>
<p>and it would say I wasn&rsquo;t paying attention.</p>
<p>When I was looking completely straight,</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t reset the attention with a steering wheel touch</p>
<p>and Super Cruise would disengage.</p>
<p>Like I was communicating to the car, I&rsquo;m like, look,</p>
<p>I am here, I am paying attention.</p>
<p>Why are you really gonna force me to disengage?</p>
<p>And it did.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a constant conversation with the user.</p>
<p>And yeah, there&rsquo;s no way to ship a system</p>
<p>like this if you can OTA.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re shipping a new one every month.</p>
<p>Sometimes we balance it with our users on Discord.</p>
<p>Like sometimes we make the driver monitoring</p>
<p>a little more aggressive and people complain.</p>
<p>Sometimes they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We want it to be as aggressive as possible</p>
<p>where people don&rsquo;t complain and it doesn&rsquo;t feel intrusive.</p>
<p>So being able to update the system over the air</p>
<p>is an essential component.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s probably to me, you mentioned,</p>
<p>I mean, to me that is the biggest innovation of Tesla,</p>
<p>that it made people realize that over the air updates</p>
<p>is essential.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, was that not obvious from the iPhone?</p>
<p>The iPhone was the first real product that OTA&rsquo;d, I think.</p>
<p>Was it actually, that&rsquo;s brilliant, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I mean, the game consoles used to not, right?</p>
<p>The game consoles were maybe the second thing that did.</p>
<p>Wow, I didn&rsquo;t really think about one of the amazing features</p>
<p>of a smartphone isn&rsquo;t just like the touchscreen</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t the thing, it&rsquo;s the ability to constantly update.</p>
<p>Yeah, it gets better.</p>
<p>It gets better.</p>
<p>Love my iOS 14.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, one thing that I probably disagree with you</p>
<p>on driver monitoring is you said that it&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>I mean, you tend to say stuff is easy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the, I guess you said it&rsquo;s easy</p>
<p>relative to the external perception problem.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate why you think it&rsquo;s easy?</p>
<p>Feature engineering works for driver monitoring.</p>
<p>Feature engineering does not work for the external.</p>
<p>So human faces are not, human faces and the movement</p>
<p>of human faces and head and body is not as variable</p>
<p>as the external environment, is your intuition?</p>
<p>Yes, and there&rsquo;s another big difference as well.</p>
<p>Your reliability of a driver monitoring system</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t actually need to be that high.</p>
<p>The uncertainty, if you have something that&rsquo;s detecting</p>
<p>whether the human&rsquo;s paying attention and it only works</p>
<p>92% of the time, you&rsquo;re still getting almost all</p>
<p>the benefit of that because the human,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re training the human, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re dealing with a system that&rsquo;s really helping you out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a conversation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like the external thing where guess what?</p>
<p>If you swerve into a tree, you swerve into a tree, right?</p>
<p>Like you get no margin for error there.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s really well put.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the right, exactly the place</p>
<p>where comparing to the external perception,</p>
<p>the control problem, the driver monitoring is easier</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t, the bar for success is much lower.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I still think like the human face</p>
<p>is more complicated actually than the external environment,</p>
<p>but for driving, you don&rsquo;t give a damn.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need, yeah, I don&rsquo;t need something,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need something that complicated</p>
<p>to have to communicate the idea to the human</p>
<p>that I want to communicate, which is,</p>
<p>yo, system might mess up here.</p>
<p>You gotta pay attention.</p>
<p>Yeah, see, that&rsquo;s my love and fascination is the human face.</p>
<p>And it feels like this is a nice place to create products</p>
<p>that create an experience in the car.</p>
<p>So like, it feels like there should be</p>
<p>more richer experiences in the car, you know?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s an opportunity for like something like On My Eye</p>
<p>or just any kind of system like a Tesla</p>
<p>or any of the autonomous vehicle companies</p>
<p>is because software is, there&rsquo;s much more sensors</p>
<p>and so much is on our software</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing machine learning anyway,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an opportunity to create totally new experiences</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not even anticipating.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think so?</p>
<p>Nah.</p>
<p>You think it&rsquo;s a box that gets you from A to B</p>
<p>and you want to do it chill?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think as soon as we get to level three</p>
<p>on highways, okay, enjoy your candy crush,</p>
<p>enjoy your Hulu, enjoy your, you know, whatever, whatever.</p>
<p>Sure, you get this, you can look at screens basically</p>
<p>versus right now where you have music and audio books.</p>
<p>So level three is where you can kind of disengage</p>
<p>in stretches of time.</p>
<p>Well, you think level three is possible?</p>
<p>Like on the highway going for 100 miles</p>
<p>and you can just go to sleep?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, sleep.</p>
<p>So again, I think it&rsquo;s really all on a spectrum.</p>
<p>I think that being able to use your phone</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on the highway and like this all being okay</p>
<p>and being aware that the car might alert you</p>
<p>and you have five seconds to basically.</p>
<p>So the five second thing is you think is possible?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it is, oh yeah.</p>
<p>Not in all scenarios, right?</p>
<p>Some scenarios it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the whole risk thing that you mentioned is nice</p>
<p>is to be able to estimate like how risky is this situation?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really important to understand.</p>
<p>One other thing you mentioned comparing KAMA</p>
<p>and Autopilot is that something about the haptic feel</p>
<p>of the way KAMA controls the car when things are uncertain.</p>
<p>Like it behaves a little bit more uncertain</p>
<p>when things are uncertain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of an interesting point.</p>
<p>And then Autopilot is much more confident always</p>
<p>even when it&rsquo;s uncertain until it runs into trouble.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a funny thing.</p>
<p>I actually mentioned that to Elon, I think.</p>
<p>And then the first time we talked, he wasn&rsquo;t biting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like communicating uncertainty.</p>
<p>I guess KAMA doesn&rsquo;t really communicate uncertainty</p>
<p>explicitly, it communicates it through haptic feel.</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s the role of communicating uncertainty</p>
<p>do you think?</p>
<p>Oh, we do some stuff explicitly.</p>
<p>Like we do detect the lanes when you&rsquo;re on the highway</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll show you how many lanes we&rsquo;re using to drive with.</p>
<p>You can look at where it thinks the lanes are.</p>
<p>You can look at the path.</p>
<p>And we want to be better about this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re actually hiring, want to hire some new UI people.</p>
<p>UI people, you mentioned this.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s such an, it&rsquo;s a UI problem too, right?</p>
<p>We have a great designer now, but you know,</p>
<p>we need people who are just going to like build this</p>
<p>and debug these UIs, QT people.</p>
<p>QT.</p>
<p>Is that what the UI is done with, is QT?</p>
<p>The new UI is in QT.</p>
<p>C++ QT?</p>
<p>Tesla uses it too.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We had some React stuff in there.</p>
<p>React JS or just React?</p>
<p>React is his own language, right?</p>
<p>React Native, React is a JavaScript framework.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all based on JavaScript, but it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>I like C++.</p>
<p>What do you think about Dojo with Tesla</p>
<p>and their foray into what appears to be</p>
<p>specialized hardware for training your own nets?</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s something, maybe you can correct me,</p>
<p>from my shallow looking at it,</p>
<p>it seems like something like Google did with TPUs,</p>
<p>but specialized for driving data.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s specialized for driving data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just legit, just TPU.</p>
<p>They want to go the Apple way,</p>
<p>basically everything required in the chain is done in house.</p>
<p>Well, so you have a problem right now,</p>
<p>and this is one of my concerns.</p>
<p>I really would like to see somebody deal with this.</p>
<p>If anyone out there is doing it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to help them if I can.</p>
<p>You basically have two options right now to train.</p>
<p>One, your options are NVIDIA or Google.</p>
<p>So Google is not even an option.</p>
<p>Their TPUs are only available in Google Cloud.</p>
<p>Google has absolutely onerous</p>
<p>terms of service restrictions.</p>
<p>They may have changed it,</p>
<p>but back in Google&rsquo;s terms of service,</p>
<p>it said explicitly you are not allowed to use Google Cloud ML</p>
<p>for training autonomous vehicles</p>
<p>or for doing anything that competes with Google</p>
<p>without Google&rsquo;s prior written permission.</p>
<p>Wow, okay.</p>
<p>I mean, Google is not a platform company.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t touch TPUs with a 10 foot pole.</p>
<p>So that leaves you with the monopoly.</p>
<p>NVIDIA? NVIDIA.</p>
<p>So, I mean.</p>
<p>That you&rsquo;re not a fan of.</p>
<p>Well, look, I was a huge fan of in 2016 NVIDIA.</p>
<p>Jensen came sat in the car.</p>
<p>Cool guy.</p>
<p>When the stock was $30 a share.</p>
<p>NVIDIA stock has skyrocketed.</p>
<p>I witnessed a real change</p>
<p>in who was in management over there in like 2018.</p>
<p>And now they are, let&rsquo;s exploit.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take every dollar we possibly can</p>
<p>out of this ecosystem.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s charge $10,000 for A100s</p>
<p>because we know we got the best shit in the game.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s charge $10,000 for an A100</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s really not that different from a 3080,</p>
<p>which is 699.</p>
<p>The margins that they are making</p>
<p>off of those high end chips are so high</p>
<p>that, I mean, I think they&rsquo;re shooting themselves</p>
<p>in the foot just from a business perspective.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s a lot of people talking like me now</p>
<p>who are like, somebody&rsquo;s gotta take NVIDIA down.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Where they could dominate it.</p>
<p>NVIDIA could be the new Intel.</p>
<p>Yeah, to be inside everything essentially.</p>
<p>And yet the winners in certain spaces</p>
<p>like autonomous driving, the winners,</p>
<p>only the people who are like desperately falling back</p>
<p>and trying to catch up and have a ton of money,</p>
<p>like the big automakers are the ones</p>
<p>interested in partnering with NVIDIA.</p>
<p>Oh, and I think a lot of those things</p>
<p>are gonna fall through.</p>
<p>If I were NVIDIA, sell chips.</p>
<p>Sell chips at a reasonable markup.</p>
<p>To everybody.</p>
<p>Without any restrictions.</p>
<p>Intel did this.</p>
<p>Look at Intel.</p>
<p>They had a great long run.</p>
<p>NVIDIA is trying to turn their,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like trying to productize their chips</p>
<p>way too much.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to extract way more value</p>
<p>than they can sustainably.</p>
<p>Sure, you can do it tomorrow.</p>
<p>Is it gonna up your share price?</p>
<p>Sure, if you&rsquo;re one of those CEOs</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s like, how much can I strip mine this company?</p>
<p>And I think, you know, and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s weird about it too.</p>
<p>Like the CEO is the founder.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same guy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I still think Jensen&rsquo;s a great guy.</p>
<p>He is great.</p>
<p>Why do this?</p>
<p>You have a choice.</p>
<p>You have a choice right now.</p>
<p>Are you trying to cash out?</p>
<p>Are you trying to buy a yacht?</p>
<p>If you are, fine.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re trying to be</p>
<p>the next huge semiconductor company, sell chips.</p>
<p>Well, the interesting thing about Jensen</p>
<p>is he is a big vision guy.</p>
<p>So he has a plan like for 50 years down the road.</p>
<p>So it makes me wonder like.</p>
<p>How does price gouging fit into it?</p>
<p>Yeah, how does that, like it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t seem to make sense as a plan.</p>
<p>I worry that he&rsquo;s listening to the wrong people.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the sense I have too sometimes.</p>
<p>Because I, despite everything, I think NVIDIA</p>
<p>is an incredible company.</p>
<p>Well, one, so I&rsquo;m deeply grateful to NVIDIA</p>
<p>for the products they&rsquo;ve created in the past.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>The 1080 Ti was a great GPU.</p>
<p>Still have a lot of them.</p>
<p>Still is, yeah.</p>
<p>But at the same time, it just feels like,</p>
<p>feels like you don&rsquo;t want to put all your stock in NVIDIA.</p>
<p>And so like Elon is doing, what Tesla is doing</p>
<p>with Autopilot and Dojo is the Apple way is,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not going to share Dojo with George Hott&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>They should sell that chip.</p>
<p>Oh, they should sell that.</p>
<p>Even their accelerator.</p>
<p>The accelerator that&rsquo;s in all the cars, the 30 watt one.</p>
<p>Sell it, why not?</p>
<p>So open it up.</p>
<p>Like make, why does Tesla have to be a car company?</p>
<p>Well, if you sell the chip, here&rsquo;s what you get.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Make some money off the chips.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take away from your chip.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to make some money, free money.</p>
<p>And also the world is going to build an ecosystem</p>
<p>of tooling for you.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to have to fix the bug in your 10H layer.</p>
<p>Someone else already did.</p>
<p>Well, the question, that&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the question Steve Jobs asked.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the question Elon Musk is perhaps asking is,</p>
<p>do you want Tesla stuff inside other vehicles?</p>
<p>Inside, potentially inside like a iRobot vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think you should decide where your advantages are.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying Tesla should start selling battery packs</p>
<p>to automakers.</p>
<p>Because battery packs to automakers,</p>
<p>they are straight up in competition with you.</p>
<p>If I were Tesla, I&rsquo;d keep the battery technology totally.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>As far as we make batteries.</p>
<p>But the thing about the Tesla TPU is anybody can build that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a question of, you know,</p>
<p>are you willing to spend the money?</p>
<p>It could be a huge source of revenue potentially.</p>
<p>Are you willing to spend a hundred million dollars?</p>
<p>Anyone can build it.</p>
<p>And someone will.</p>
<p>And a bunch of companies now are starting</p>
<p>trying to build AI accelerators.</p>
<p>Somebody is going to get the idea right.</p>
<p>And yeah, hopefully they don&rsquo;t get greedy</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ll just lose to the next guy who finally,</p>
<p>and then eventually the Chinese are going to make knockoff</p>
<p>and video chips and that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>From your perspective,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re also paying attention</p>
<p>to stay on Tesla for a moment.</p>
<p>Dave, Elon Musk has talked about a complete rewrite</p>
<p>of the neural net that they&rsquo;re using.</p>
<p>That seems to, again, I&rsquo;m half paying attention,</p>
<p>but it seems to involve basically a kind of integration</p>
<p>of all the sensors to where it&rsquo;s a four dimensional view.</p>
<p>You know, you have a 3D model of the world over time.</p>
<p>And then you can, I think it&rsquo;s done both for the,</p>
<p>for the actually, you know,</p>
<p>so the neural network is able to,</p>
<p>in a more holistic way,</p>
<p>deal with the world and make predictions and so on,</p>
<p>but also to make the annotation task more, you know, easier.</p>
<p>Like you can annotate the world in one place</p>
<p>and then kind of distribute itself across the sensors</p>
<p>and across a different,</p>
<p>like the hundreds of tasks that are involved</p>
<p>in the Hydro Net.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about this rewrite?</p>
<p>Is it just like some details that are kind of obvious</p>
<p>that are steps that should be taken,</p>
<p>or is there something fundamental</p>
<p>that could challenge your idea</p>
<p>that end to end is the right solution?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in the middle of a big rewrite now as well.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t shipped a new model in a bit.</p>
<p>Of what kind?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going from 2D to 3D.</p>
<p>Right now, all our stuff, like for example,</p>
<p>when the car pitches back,</p>
<p>the lane lines also pitch back</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re assuming the flat world hypothesis.</p>
<p>The new models do not do this.</p>
<p>The new models output everything in 3D.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s still no annotation.</p>
<p>So the 3D is, it&rsquo;s more about the output.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We have Zs in everything.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve&hellip;</p>
<p>Zs.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We had a Zs.</p>
<p>We unified a lot of stuff as well.</p>
<p>We switched from TensorFlow to PyTorch.</p>
<p>My understanding of what Tesla&rsquo;s thing is,</p>
<p>is that their annotator now annotates</p>
<p>across the time dimension.</p>
<p>Mm hmm.</p>
<p>I mean, cute.</p>
<p>Why are you building an annotator?</p>
<p>I find their entire pipeline.</p>
<p>I find your vision, I mean,</p>
<p>the vision of end to end very compelling,</p>
<p>but I also like the engineering of the data engine</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve created.</p>
<p>In terms of supervised learning pipelines,</p>
<p>that thing is damn impressive.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re basically, the idea is that you have</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands of people</p>
<p>that are doing data collection for you</p>
<p>by doing their experience.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of similar to the Comma AI model.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re able to mine that data</p>
<p>based on the kind of edge cases you need.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s harder to do in the end to end learning.</p>
<p>The mining of the right edge cases.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s where feature engineering</p>
<p>is actually really powerful</p>
<p>because like us humans are able to do</p>
<p>this kind of mining a little better.</p>
<p>But yeah, there&rsquo;s obvious, as we know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s obvious constraints and limitations to that idea.</p>
<p>Carpathia just tweeted, he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you get really interesting insights</p>
<p>if you sort your validation set by loss</p>
<p>and look at the highest loss examples.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean, you can do,</p>
<p>we have a little data engine like thing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re training a segment.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s not fancy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, okay, train the new segment,</p>
<p>run it on 100,000 images</p>
<p>and now take the thousand with highest loss.</p>
<p>Select a hundred of those by human,</p>
<p>put those, get those ones labeled, retrain, do it again.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a much less well written data engine.</p>
<p>And yeah, you can take these things really far</p>
<p>and it is impressive engineering.</p>
<p>And if you truly need supervised data for a problem,</p>
<p>yeah, things like data engine are at the high end</p>
<p>of what is attention?</p>
<p>Is a human paying attention?</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re going to probably build something</p>
<p>that looks like data engine</p>
<p>to push our driver monitoring further.</p>
<p>But for driving itself,</p>
<p>you have it all annotated beautifully by what the human does.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, that applies to driver attention as well.</p>
<p>Do you want to detect the eyes?</p>
<p>Do you want to detect blinking and pupil movement?</p>
<p>Do you want to detect all the like face alignments</p>
<p>or landmark detection and so on,</p>
<p>and then doing kind of reasoning based on that?</p>
<p>Or do you want to take the entirety of the face over time</p>
<p>and do end to end?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s obvious that eventually you have to do end</p>
<p>to end with some calibration, some fixes and so on,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know when that&rsquo;s the right move.</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s end to end, there actually is,</p>
<p>there is no kind of, you have to supervise that with humans.</p>
<p>Whether a human is paying attention or not</p>
<p>is a completely subjective judgment.</p>
<p>Like you can try to like automatically do it</p>
<p>with some stuff, but you don&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>if I record a video of a human,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have true annotations anywhere in that video.</p>
<p>The only way to get them is with,</p>
<p>you know, other humans labeling it really.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>If you think deeply about it,</p>
<p>you could, you might be able to just,</p>
<p>depending on the task,</p>
<p>maybe a discover self annotating things like,</p>
<p>you know, you can look at like steering wheel reverse</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>You can discover little moments of lapse of attention.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s where psychology comes in.</p>
<p>Is there indicate,</p>
<p>cause you have so much data to look at.</p>
<p>So you might be able to find moments when there&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>just inattention that even with smartphone,</p>
<p>if you want to detect smartphone use,</p>
<p>you can start to zoom in.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the gold mine, sort of the comma AI.</p>
<p>I mean, Tesla is doing this too, right?</p>
<p>Is they&rsquo;re doing annotation based on,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a self supervised learning too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a small part of the entire picture.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of the challenge of solving a problem</p>
<p>in machine learning.</p>
<p>If you can discover self annotating parts of the problem,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Our driver monitoring team is half a person right now.</p>
<p>I would, you know, once we have,</p>
<p>once we have two, three people on that team,</p>
<p>I definitely want to look at self annotating stuff</p>
<p>for attention.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go back for a sec to a comma and what,</p>
<p>you know, for people who are curious to try it out,</p>
<p>how do you install a comma in say a 2020 Toyota Corolla</p>
<p>or like, what are the cars that are supported?</p>
<p>What are the cars that you recommend?</p>
<p>And what does it take?</p>
<p>You have a few videos out, but maybe through words,</p>
<p>can you explain what&rsquo;s it take to actually install a thing?</p>
<p>So we support, I think it&rsquo;s 91 cars, 91 makes the models.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got to 100 this year.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>The, yeah, the 2020 Corolla, great choice.</p>
<p>The 2020 Sonata, it&rsquo;s using the stock longitudinal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s using just our lateral control,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a very refined car.</p>
<p>Their longitudinal control is not bad at all.</p>
<p>So yeah, Corolla, Sonata,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re willing to get your hands a little dirty</p>
<p>and look in the right places on the internet,</p>
<p>the Honda Civic is great,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re going to have to install a modified EPS firmware</p>
<p>in order to get a little bit more torque.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t help you with that.</p>
<p>Comma does not officially endorse that,</p>
<p>but we have been doing it.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t ever release it.</p>
<p>We waited for someone else to discover it.</p>
<p>And then, you know.</p>
<p>And you have a Discord server where people,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a very active developer community, I suppose.</p>
<p>So depending on the level of experimentation</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re willing to do, that&rsquo;s the community.</p>
<p>If you just want to buy it and you have a supported car,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 10 minutes to install.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s YouTube videos.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Ikea furniture level.</p>
<p>If you can set up a table from Ikea,</p>
<p>you can install a Comma 2 in your supported car</p>
<p>and it will just work.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re like, oh, but I want this high end feature</p>
<p>or I want to fix this bug.</p>
<p>Okay, well, welcome to the developer community.</p>
<p>So what, if I wanted to,</p>
<p>this is something I asked you offline like a few months ago.</p>
<p>If I wanted to run my own code to,</p>
<p>so use Comma as a platform</p>
<p>and try to run something like OpenPilot,</p>
<p>what does it take to do that?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a toggle in the settings called enable SSH.</p>
<p>And if you toggle that, you can SSH into your device.</p>
<p>You can modify the code.</p>
<p>You can upload whatever code you want to it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole lot of people.</p>
<p>So about 60% of people are running stock comma.</p>
<p>About 40% of people are running forks.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a community of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of people who maintain these forks</p>
<p>and these forks support different cars</p>
<p>or they have different toggles.</p>
<p>We try to keep away from the toggles</p>
<p>that are like disabled driver monitoring,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some people might want that kind of thing</p>
<p>and like, yeah, you can, it&rsquo;s your car.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not here to tell you.</p>
<p>We have some, we ban,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re trying to subvert safety features,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re banned from our Discord.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want anything to do with you,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some forks doing that.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So you encourage responsible forking.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>We encourage, some people, yeah, some people,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s forks that will do,</p>
<p>some people just like having a lot of readouts on the UI,</p>
<p>like a lot of like flashing numbers.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s forks that do that.</p>
<p>Some people don&rsquo;t like the fact that it disengages</p>
<p>when you press the gas pedal.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s forks that disable that.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Now the stock experience is what like,</p>
<p>so it does both lane keeping</p>
<p>and longitudinal control all together.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not separate like it is in autopilot.</p>
<p>No, so, okay.</p>
<p>Some cars we use the stock longitudinal control.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t do the longitudinal control in all the cars.</p>
<p>Some cars, the ACCs are pretty good in the cars.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the lane keep that&rsquo;s atrocious in anything</p>
<p>except for autopilot and super cruise.</p>
<p>But, you know, you just turn it on and it works.</p>
<p>What does this engagement look like?</p>
<p>Yeah, so we have, I mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very concerned about mode confusion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve experienced it on super cruise and autopilot</p>
<p>where like autopilot, like autopilot disengages.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t realize that the ACC is still on.</p>
<p>The lead car moves slightly over</p>
<p>and then the Tesla accelerates</p>
<p>to like whatever my set speed is super fast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, what&rsquo;s going on here?</p>
<p>We have engaged and disengaged.</p>
<p>And this is similar to my understanding, I&rsquo;m not a pilot,</p>
<p>but my understanding is either the pilot is in control</p>
<p>or the copilot is in control.</p>
<p>And we have the same kind of transition system.</p>
<p>Either open pilot is engaged or open pilot is disengaged.</p>
<p>Engage with cruise control,</p>
<p>disengage with either gas brake or cancel.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about money.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the business strategy for Kama?</p>
<p>Profitable.</p>
<p>Well, so you&rsquo;re.</p>
<p>We did it.</p>
<p>So congratulations.</p>
<p>What, so basically selling,</p>
<p>so we should say Kama cost a thousand bucks, Kama two?</p>
<p>200 for the interface to the car as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 1200, I&rsquo;ll send that.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s usually upfront like this.</p>
<p>Yeah, you gotta add the tack on, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna lie to you.</p>
<p>Trust me, it will add $1,200 of value to your life.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s still super cheap.</p>
<p>30 days, no questions asked, money back guarantee,</p>
<p>and prices are only going up.</p>
<p>If there ever is future hardware,</p>
<p>it could cost a lot more than $1,200.</p>
<p>So Kama three is in the works.</p>
<p>It could be.</p>
<p>All I will say is future hardware</p>
<p>is going to cost a lot more than the current hardware.</p>
<p>Yeah, the people that use,</p>
<p>the people I&rsquo;ve spoken with that use Kama,</p>
<p>that use open pilot,</p>
<p>first of all, they use it a lot.</p>
<p>So people that use it, they fall in love with it.</p>
<p>Oh, our retention rate is insane.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good sign.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really good sign.</p>
<p>70% of Kama two buyers are daily active users.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Oh, also, we don&rsquo;t plan on stopping selling the Kama two.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s, you know.</p>
<p>So whatever you create that&rsquo;s beyond Kama two,</p>
<p>it would be potentially a phase shift.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s so much better that,</p>
<p>like you could use Kama two</p>
<p>and you can use Kama whatever.</p>
<p>Depends what you want.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 3.41, 42.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, autopilot hardware one versus hardware two.</p>
<p>The Kama two is kind of like hardware one.</p>
<p>Got it, got it.</p>
<p>You can still use both.</p>
<p>Got it, got it.</p>
<p>I think I heard you talk about retention rate</p>
<p>with the VR headsets that the average is just once.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Just fast.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s such a fascinating way</p>
<p>to think about technology.</p>
<p>And this is a really, really good sign.</p>
<p>And the other thing that people say about Kama</p>
<p>is like they can&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;re getting this 4,000 bucks.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>It seems like some kind of steal.</p>
<p>So, but in terms of like longterm business strategies</p>
<p>that basically to put,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s currently in like a thousand plus cars.</p>
<p>1,200.</p>
<p>More, more.</p>
<p>So yeah, dailies is about, dailies is about 2,000.</p>
<p>Weeklys is about 2,500, monthlys is over 3,000.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve grown a lot since we last talked.</p>
<p>Is the goal, like can we talk crazy for a second?</p>
<p>I mean, what&rsquo;s the goal to overtake Tesla?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk, okay, so.</p>
<p>I mean, Android did overtake iOS.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly it, right?</p>
<p>So they did it.</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t know the timeline of that one.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s talk, because everything is in alpha now.</p>
<p>The autopilot you could argue is in alpha</p>
<p>in terms of towards the big mission</p>
<p>of autonomous driving, right?</p>
<p>And so what, yeah, is your goal to overtake</p>
<p>millions of cars essentially?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Where would it stop?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s open source software.</p>
<p>It might not be millions of cars</p>
<p>with a piece of comma hardware, but yeah.</p>
<p>I think open pilot at some point</p>
<p>will cross over autopilot in users,</p>
<p>just like Android crossed over iOS.</p>
<p>How does Google make money from Android?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s complicated.</p>
<p>Their own devices make money.</p>
<p>Google, Google makes money</p>
<p>by just kind of having you on the internet.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Google search is built in, Gmail is built in.</p>
<p>Android is just a shill</p>
<p>for the rest of Google&rsquo;s ecosystem.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the problem is Android is not,</p>
<p>is a brilliant thing.</p>
<p>I mean, Android arguably changed the world.</p>
<p>So there you go.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, you can feel good ethically speaking.</p>
<p>But as a business strategy, it&rsquo;s questionable.</p>
<p>Or sell hardware.</p>
<p>Sell hardware.</p>
<p>I mean, it took Google a long time to come around to it,</p>
<p>but they are now making money on the Pixel.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not about money, you&rsquo;re more about winning.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>No, but if only 10% of open pilot devices</p>
<p>come from comma AI.</p>
<p>They still make a lot.</p>
<p>That is still, yes.</p>
<p>That is a ton of money for our company.</p>
<p>But can&rsquo;t somebody create a better comma using open pilot?</p>
<p>Or are you basically saying, well, I&rsquo;ll compete them?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll compete you.</p>
<p>Can you create a better Android phone than the Google Pixel?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, you can, but like, you know.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re confident, like, you know</p>
<p>what the hell you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s confidence and merit.</p>
<p>I mean, our money comes from, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a consumer electronics company.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And put it this way.</p>
<p>So we sold like 3,000 comma twos.</p>
<p>2,500 right now.</p>
<p>And like, OK, we&rsquo;re probably going</p>
<p>to sell 10,000 units next year.</p>
<p>10,000 units, even just $1,000 a unit, OK,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re at 10 million in revenue.</p>
<p>Get that up to 100,000, maybe double the price of the unit.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re talking like 200 million revenue.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking like series.</p>
<p>Yeah, actually making money.</p>
<p>One of the rare semi autonomous or autonomous vehicle companies</p>
<p>that are actually making money.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, if you look at a model,</p>
<p>and we were just talking about this yesterday.</p>
<p>If you look at a model, and like you&rsquo;re AB testing your model,</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re one branch of the AB test,</p>
<p>the losses go down very fast in the first five epochs.</p>
<p>That model is probably going to converge</p>
<p>to something considerably better than the one</p>
<p>where the losses are going down slower.</p>
<p>Why do people think this is going to stop?</p>
<p>Why do people think one day there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be a great like, well, Waymo&rsquo;s eventually</p>
<p>going to surpass you guys?</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Do you see like a world where like a Tesla or a car</p>
<p>like a Tesla would be able to basically press a button</p>
<p>and you like switch to open pilot?</p>
<p>You know, you load in.</p>
<p>No, so I think so first off, I think</p>
<p>that we may surpass Tesla in terms of users.</p>
<p>I do not think we&rsquo;re going to surpass Tesla ever</p>
<p>in terms of revenue.</p>
<p>I think Tesla can capture a lot more revenue per user</p>
<p>than we can.</p>
<p>But this mimics the Android iOS model exactly.</p>
<p>There may be more Android devices,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot more iPhones than Google Pixels.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;ll be a lot more Tesla cars sold</p>
<p>than pieces of common hardware.</p>
<p>And then as far as a Tesla owner being</p>
<p>able to switch to open pilot, does iPhones run Android?</p>
<p>No, but it doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>You can if you really want to do it,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t really make sense.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>Who cares?</p>
<p>What about if a large company like automakers, Ford, GM,</p>
<p>Toyota came to George Hots?</p>
<p>Or on the tech space, Amazon, Facebook, Google</p>
<p>came with a large pile of cash?</p>
<p>Would you consider being purchased?</p>
<p>Do you see that as a one possible?</p>
<p>Not seriously, no.</p>
<p>I would probably see how much shit they&rsquo;ll entertain for me.</p>
<p>And if they&rsquo;re willing to jump through a bunch of my hoops,</p>
<p>then maybe.</p>
<p>But no, not the way that M&amp;A works today.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve been approached.</p>
<p>And I laugh in these people&rsquo;s faces.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, are you kidding?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s so demeaning.</p>
<p>The M&amp;A people are so demeaning to companies.</p>
<p>They treat the startup world as their innovation ecosystem.</p>
<p>And they think that I&rsquo;m cool with going along with that,</p>
<p>so I can have some of their scam fake Fed dollars.</p>
<p>Fed coin.</p>
<p>What am I going to do with more Fed coin?</p>
<p>Fed coin.</p>
<p>Fed coin, man.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the cool thing about podcasting,</p>
<p>actually, is people criticize.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar with Spotify giving Joe Rogan</p>
<p>$100 million.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about that.</p>
<p>And they respect, despite all the shit</p>
<p>that people are talking about Spotify,</p>
<p>people understand that podcasters like Joe Rogan</p>
<p>know what the hell they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So they give them money and say, just do what you do.</p>
<p>And the equivalent for you would be like,</p>
<p>George, do what the hell you do, because you&rsquo;re good at it.</p>
<p>Try not to murder too many people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some kind of common sense things,</p>
<p>like just don&rsquo;t go on a weird rampage of it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It comes down to what companies I could respect, right?</p>
<p>Could I respect GM?</p>
<p>Never.</p>
<p>No, I couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, could I respect a Hyundai?</p>
<p>More so.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot closer.</p>
<p>Toyota?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your?</p>
<p>Nah.</p>
<p>Korean is the way.</p>
<p>I think that the Japanese, the Germans, the US, they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>too, they&rsquo;re all too, they all think they&rsquo;re too great.</p>
<p>What about the tech companies?</p>
<p>Apple?</p>
<p>Apple is, of the tech companies that I could respect,</p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s the closest.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I could never.</p>
<p>It would be ironic.</p>
<p>It would be ironic if Comma AI is acquired by Apple.</p>
<p>I mean, Facebook, look, I quit Facebook 10 years ago</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t respect the business model.</p>
<p>Google has declined so fast in the last five years.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about Waymo and its present</p>
<p>and its future?</p>
<p>Let me start by saying something nice, which is I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>visited them a few times and have ridden in their cars.</p>
<p>And the engineering that they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>both the research and the actual development</p>
<p>and the engineering they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and the scale they&rsquo;re actually achieving</p>
<p>by doing it all themselves is really impressive.</p>
<p>And the balance of safety and innovation.</p>
<p>And the cars work really well for the routes they drive.</p>
<p>It drives fast, which was very surprising to me.</p>
<p>It drives the speed limit or faster than the speed limit.</p>
<p>It goes.</p>
<p>And it works really damn well.</p>
<p>And the interface is nice.</p>
<p>In Chandler, Arizona, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, in Chandler, Arizona, very specific environment.</p>
<p>So it gives me enough material in my mind</p>
<p>to push back against the madmen of the world,</p>
<p>like George Hotz, to be like, because you kind of imply</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s zero probability they&rsquo;re going to win.</p>
<p>And after I&rsquo;ve used, after I&rsquo;ve ridden in it, to me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not zero.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s not for technology reasons.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s worse than that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually for product reasons, I think.</p>
<p>Oh, you think they&rsquo;re just not capable of creating</p>
<p>an amazing product?</p>
<p>No, I think that the product that they&rsquo;re building</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>So a few things.</p>
<p>You say the Waymo&rsquo;s are fast.</p>
<p>Benchmark a Waymo against a competent Uber driver.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>The Uber driver&rsquo;s faster.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even about speed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the thing you said.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the experience of being stuck at a stop sign</p>
<p>because pedestrians are crossing nonstop.</p>
<p>I like when my Uber driver doesn&rsquo;t come to a full stop</p>
<p>at the stop sign.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>And so let&rsquo;s say the Waymo&rsquo;s are 20% slower than an Uber.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>You can argue that they&rsquo;re going to be cheaper.</p>
<p>And I argue that users already have the choice</p>
<p>to trade off money for speed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called UberPool.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like 15% of rides are UberPools.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Users are not willing to trade off money for speed.</p>
<p>So the whole product that they&rsquo;re building</p>
<p>is not going to be competitive with traditional ride sharing</p>
<p>networks.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And also, whether there&rsquo;s profit to be made</p>
<p>depends entirely on one company having a monopoly.</p>
<p>I think that the level four autonomous ride sharing</p>
<p>vehicles market is going to look a lot like the scooter market</p>
<p>if even the technology does come to exist, which I question.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s doing well in that market?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a race to the bottom.</p>
<p>Well, it could be closer like an Uber and a Lyft,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s just one or two players.</p>
<p>Well, the scooter people have given up</p>
<p>trying to market scooters as a practical means</p>
<p>of transportation.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re just like, they&rsquo;re super fun to ride.</p>
<p>Look at wheels.</p>
<p>I love those things.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re great on that front.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But from an actual transportation product</p>
<p>perspective, I do not think scooters are viable.</p>
<p>And I do not think level four autonomous cars are viable.</p>
<p>If you, let&rsquo;s play a fun experiment.</p>
<p>If you ran, let&rsquo;s do a Tesla and let&rsquo;s do Waymo.</p>
<p>If Elon Musk took a vacation for a year, he just said,</p>
<p>screw it, I&rsquo;m going to go live on an island, no electronics.</p>
<p>And the board decides that we need to find somebody</p>
<p>to run the company.</p>
<p>And they did decide that you should run the company</p>
<p>for a year.</p>
<p>How do you run Tesla differently?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t change much.</p>
<p>Do you think they&rsquo;re on the right track?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;d have some minor changes.</p>
<p>But even my debate with Tesla about end</p>
<p>to end versus SegNets, that&rsquo;s just software.</p>
<p>Who cares?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re doing something terrible with SegNets.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably building something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>at least going to help you debug the end to end system a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to transition from what they have</p>
<p>to an end to end kind of thing.</p>
<p>And then I presume you would, in the Model Y</p>
<p>or maybe in the Model 3, start adding driver</p>
<p>sensing with infrared.</p>
<p>Yes, I would add infrared camera, infrared lights</p>
<p>right away to those cars.</p>
<p>And start collecting that data and do all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>yeah.</p>
<p>Very much.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re already kind of doing it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredibly minor change.</p>
<p>If I actually were CEO of Tesla, first off,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be horrified that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do</p>
<p>a better job as Elon.</p>
<p>And then I would try to understand</p>
<p>the way he&rsquo;s done things before.</p>
<p>You would also have to take over his Twitter.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t tweet.</p>
<p>Yeah, what&rsquo;s your Twitter situation?</p>
<p>Why are you so quiet on Twitter?</p>
<p>Since Dukama is like what&rsquo;s your social network presence like?</p>
<p>Because on Instagram, you do live streams.</p>
<p>You understand the music of the internet,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t always fully engage into it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re part time.</p>
<p>Well, I used to have a Twitter.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, Instagram is a pretty place.</p>
<p>Instagram is a beautiful place.</p>
<p>It glorifies beauty.</p>
<p>I like Instagram&rsquo;s values as a network.</p>
<p>Twitter glorifies conflict, glorifies shots,</p>
<p>taking shots of people.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, you know, Twitter and Donald Trump</p>
<p>are perfectly, they&rsquo;re perfect for each other.</p>
<p>So Tesla&rsquo;s on the right track in your view.</p>
<p>OK, so let&rsquo;s try, let&rsquo;s really try this experiment.</p>
<p>If you ran Waymo, let&rsquo;s say they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you agree, but they</p>
<p>seem to be at the head of the pack of the kind of,</p>
<p>what would you call that approach?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not necessarily lighter based</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not about lighter.</p>
<p>Level four robotaxi.</p>
<p>Level four robotaxi, all in before making any revenue.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re probably at the head of the pack.</p>
<p>If you were said, hey, George, can you</p>
<p>please run this company for a year, how would you change it?</p>
<p>I would go.</p>
<p>I would get Anthony Levandowski out of jail,</p>
<p>and I would put him in charge of the company.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s try to break that apart.</p>
<p>Why do you want to destroy the company by doing that?</p>
<p>Or do you mean you like renegade style thinking that pushes,</p>
<p>that throws away bureaucracy and goes</p>
<p>to first principle thinking?</p>
<p>What do you mean by that?</p>
<p>I think Anthony Levandowski is a genius,</p>
<p>and I think he would come up with a much better idea of what</p>
<p>to do with Waymo than me.</p>
<p>So you mean that unironically.</p>
<p>He is a genius.</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>Without a doubt.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not saying there&rsquo;s no shortcomings,</p>
<p>but in the interactions I&rsquo;ve had with him, yeah.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also willing to take, like, who knows</p>
<p>what he would do with Waymo?</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s also out there, like far more out there</p>
<p>than I am.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s big risks.</p>
<p>What do you make of him?</p>
<p>I was going to talk to him on this podcast,</p>
<p>and I was going back and forth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m such a gullible, naive human.</p>
<p>Like, I see the best in people.</p>
<p>And I slowly started to realize that there</p>
<p>might be some people out there that, like,</p>
<p>have multiple faces to the world.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re, like, deceiving and dishonest.</p>
<p>I still refuse to, like, I just, I trust people,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t care if I get hurt by it.</p>
<p>But, like, you know, sometimes you</p>
<p>have to be a little bit careful, especially platform</p>
<p>wise and podcast wise.</p>
<p>What do you, what am I supposed to think?</p>
<p>So you think, you think he&rsquo;s a good person?</p>
<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really make moral judgments.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to.</p>
<p>Oh, I mean this about the Waymo.</p>
<p>I actually, I mean that whole idea very nonironically</p>
<p>about what I would do.</p>
<p>The problem with putting me in charge of Waymo</p>
<p>is Waymo is already $10 billion in the hole, right?</p>
<p>Whatever idea Waymo does, look, commas profitable, commas</p>
<p>raised $8.1 million.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s small, you know, that&rsquo;s small money.</p>
<p>Like, I can build a reasonable consumer electronics company</p>
<p>and succeed wildly at that and still never be able to pay back</p>
<p>Waymo&rsquo;s $10 billion.</p>
<p>So I think the basic idea with Waymo, well,</p>
<p>forget the $10 billion because they have some backing,</p>
<p>but your basic thing is, like, what can we do</p>
<p>to start making some money?</p>
<p>Well, no, I mean, my bigger idea is, like,</p>
<p>whatever the idea is that&rsquo;s gonna save Waymo,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna have to be a big risk idea</p>
<p>and I cannot think of a better person</p>
<p>than Anthony Levandowski to do it.</p>
<p>So that is completely what I would do as CEO of Waymo.</p>
<p>I would call myself a transitionary CEO,</p>
<p>do everything I can to fix that situation up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna see.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because I can&rsquo;t do it, right?</p>
<p>Like, I can&rsquo;t, I mean, I can talk about how</p>
<p>what I really wanna do is just apologize</p>
<p>for all those corny, you know, ad campaigns</p>
<p>and be like, here&rsquo;s the real state of the technology.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s, like, I have several criticism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little bit more bullish on Waymo</p>
<p>than you seem to be, but one criticism I have</p>
<p>is it went into corny mode too early.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s still a startup.</p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t delivered on anything.</p>
<p>So it should be, like, more renegade</p>
<p>and show off the engineering that they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>which just can be impressive,</p>
<p>as opposed to doing these weird commercials</p>
<p>of, like, your friendly car company.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s my biggest snipe at Waymo is always,</p>
<p>that guy&rsquo;s a paid actor.</p>
<p>That guy&rsquo;s not a Waymo user.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a paid actor.</p>
<p>Look here, I found his call sheet.</p>
<p>Do kind of like what SpaceX is doing</p>
<p>with the rocket launches.</p>
<p>Just put the nerds up front, put the engineers up front,</p>
<p>and just, like, show failures too, just.</p>
<p>I love SpaceX&rsquo;s, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, the thing that they&rsquo;re doing is right,</p>
<p>and it just feels like the right.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all so excited to see them succeed.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to see when it won&rsquo;t fail, you know?</p>
<p>Like, you lie to me, I want you to fail.</p>
<p>You tell me the truth, you be honest with me,</p>
<p>I want you to succeed.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ah, yeah, and that requires the renegade CEO, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with you, I&rsquo;m with you.</p>
<p>I still have a little bit of faith in Waymo</p>
<p>for the renegade CEO to step forward, but.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not John Kraftik.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s, you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not Chris Hormiston.</p>
<p>And those people may be very good at certain things.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re not renegades.</p>
<p>Yeah, because these companies are fundamentally,</p>
<p>even though we&rsquo;re talking about billion dollars,</p>
<p>all these crazy numbers,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re still, like, early stage startups.</p>
<p>I mean, and I just, if you are pre revenue</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve raised 10 billion dollars,</p>
<p>I have no idea, like, this just doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s against everything Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s your minimum viable product?</p>
<p>You know, where&rsquo;s your users?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s your growth numbers?</p>
<p>This is traditional Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Why do you not apply it to what you think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re too big to fail already, like?</p>
<p>How do you think autonomous driving will change society?</p>
<p>So the mission is, for comma, to solve self driving.</p>
<p>Do you have, like, a vision of the world</p>
<p>of how it&rsquo;ll be different?</p>
<p>Is it as simple as A to B transportation?</p>
<p>Or is there, like, cause these are robots.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about autonomous driving in and of itself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what the technology enables.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I think it&rsquo;s the coolest applied AI problem.</p>
<p>I like it because it has a clear path to monetary value.</p>
<p>But as far as that being the thing that changes the world,</p>
<p>I mean, no, like, there&rsquo;s cute things we&rsquo;re doing in common.</p>
<p>Like, who&rsquo;d have thought you could stick a phone</p>
<p>on the windshield and it&rsquo;ll drive.</p>
<p>But like, really, the product that you&rsquo;re building</p>
<p>is not something that people were not capable</p>
<p>of imagining 50 years ago.</p>
<p>So no, it doesn&rsquo;t change the world on that front.</p>
<p>Could people have imagined the internet 50 years ago?</p>
<p>Only true genius visionaries.</p>
<p>Everyone could have imagined autonomous cars 50 years ago.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a car, but I don&rsquo;t drive it.</p>
<p>See, I have this sense, and I told you, like,</p>
<p>my longterm dream is robots with which you have deep,</p>
<p>with whom you have deep connections, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s different trajectories towards that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been thinking,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ve been thinking of launching a startup.</p>
<p>I see autonomous vehicles</p>
<p>as a potential trajectory to that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not where the direction I would like to go,</p>
<p>but I also see Tesla or even Comma AI,</p>
<p>like, pivoting into robotics broadly defined</p>
<p>at some stage in the way, like you&rsquo;re mentioning,</p>
<p>the internet didn&rsquo;t expect.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s solve, you know, when I say a comma about this,</p>
<p>we could talk about this,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s solve self driving cars first.</p>
<p>You gotta stay focused on the mission.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re not too big to fail.</p>
<p>For however much I think Comma&rsquo;s winning,</p>
<p>like, no, no, no, no, no, you&rsquo;re winning</p>
<p>when you solve level five self driving cars.</p>
<p>And until then, you haven&rsquo;t won.</p>
<p>And you know, again, you wanna be arrogant</p>
<p>in the face of other people, great.</p>
<p>You wanna be arrogant in the face of nature, you&rsquo;re an idiot.</p>
<p>Stay mission focused, brilliantly put.</p>
<p>Like I mentioned, thinking of launching a startup,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been considering, actually, before COVID,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking of moving to San Francisco.</p>
<p>Ooh, ooh, I wouldn&rsquo;t go there.</p>
<p>So why is, well, and now I&rsquo;m thinking</p>
<p>about potentially Austin and we&rsquo;re in San Diego now.</p>
<p>San Diego, come here.</p>
<p>So why, what, I mean, you&rsquo;re such an interesting human.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve launched so many successful things.</p>
<p>What, why San Diego?</p>
<p>What do you recommend?</p>
<p>Why not San Francisco?</p>
<p>Have you thought, so in your case,</p>
<p>San Diego with Qualcomm and Snapdragon,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s an amazing combination.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t really why.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t the why?</p>
<p>No, I mean, Qualcomm was an afterthought.</p>
<p>Qualcomm was, it was a nice thing to think about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you can have a tech company here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And a good one, I mean, you know, I like Qualcomm, but.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Well, so why San Diego better than San Francisco?</p>
<p>Why does San Francisco suck?</p>
<p>Well, so, okay, so first off,</p>
<p>we all kind of said like, we wanna stay in California.</p>
<p>People like the ocean.</p>
<p>You know, California, for its flaws,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a lot of the flaws of California</p>
<p>are not necessarily California as a whole,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re much more San Francisco specific.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>San Francisco, so I think first tier cities in general</p>
<p>have stopped wanting growth.</p>
<p>Well, you have like in San Francisco, you know,</p>
<p>the voting class always votes to not build more houses</p>
<p>because they own all the houses.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, well, you know,</p>
<p>once people have figured out how to vote themselves</p>
<p>more money, they&rsquo;re gonna do it.</p>
<p>It is so insanely corrupt.</p>
<p>It is not balanced at all, like political party wise,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s a one party city and.</p>
<p>For all the discussion of diversity,</p>
<p>it stops lacking real diversity of thought,</p>
<p>of background, of approaches, of strategies, of ideas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a strange place</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s the loudest people about diversity</p>
<p>and the biggest lack of diversity.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what they say, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the projection.</p>
<p>Projection, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>And even people in Silicon Valley tell me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like high up people,</p>
<p>everybody is like, this is a terrible place.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>I mean, and coronavirus is really what killed it.</p>
<p>San Francisco was the number one exodus</p>
<p>during coronavirus.</p>
<p>We still think San Diego is a good place to be.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see what happens with California a bit longer term.</p>
<p>Like Austin&rsquo;s an interesting choice.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t have really anything bad to say</p>
<p>about Austin either,</p>
<p>except for the extreme heat in the summer,</p>
<p>which, but that&rsquo;s like very on the surface, right?</p>
<p>I think as far as like an ecosystem goes, it&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>I personally love Colorado.</p>
<p>Colorado&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you have these states that are,</p>
<p>like just way better run.</p>
<p>California is, you know, it&rsquo;s especially San Francisco.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a tie horse and like, yeah.</p>
<p>Can I ask you for advice to me and to others</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s it take to build a successful startup?</p>
<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t done that.</p>
<p>Talk to someone who did that.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ve, you know,</p>
<p>this is like another book of years</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll buy for $67, I suppose.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, um.</p>
<p>One of these days I&rsquo;ll sell out.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Jailbreaks are going to be a dollar</p>
<p>and books are going to be 67.</p>
<p>How I jailbroke the iPhone by George Hots.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>How I jail broke the iPhone and you can too.</p>
<p>You can too.</p>
<p>67 dollars.</p>
<p>In 21 days.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Oh God.</p>
<p>Okay, I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>But quite, so you have an introspective,</p>
<p>you have built a very unique company.</p>
<p>I mean, not you, but you and others.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, there&rsquo;s nothing.</p>
<p>You have an introspective,</p>
<p>you haven&rsquo;t really sat down and thought about like,</p>
<p>well, like if you and I were having a bunch of,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re having some beers</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re seeing that I&rsquo;m depressed</p>
<p>and whatever, I&rsquo;m struggling.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no advice you can give?</p>
<p>Oh, I mean.</p>
<p>More beer?</p>
<p>Um, yeah, I think it&rsquo;s all very like situation dependent.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s, okay, if I can give a generic piece of advice,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the technology always wins.</p>
<p>The better technology always wins.</p>
<p>And lying always loses.</p>
<p>Build technology and don&rsquo;t lie.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with you.</p>
<p>I agree very much.</p>
<p>The long run, long run.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the long run, yeah.</p>
<p>The market can remain irrational longer</p>
<p>than you can remain solvent.</p>
<p>True fact.</p>
<p>Well, this is an interesting point</p>
<p>because I ethically and just as a human believe that</p>
<p>like hype and smoke and mirrors is not</p>
<p>at any stage of the company is a good strategy.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s some like, you know,</p>
<p>PR magic kind of like, you know.</p>
<p>Oh, hype around a new product, right?</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a call to action,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s like a call to action,</p>
<p>like buy my new GPU, look at it.</p>
<p>It takes up three slots and it&rsquo;s this big.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s huge.</p>
<p>Buy my GPU.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>If you look at, you know,</p>
<p>especially in the AI space broadly,</p>
<p>but autonomous vehicles,</p>
<p>like you can raise a huge amount of money on nothing.</p>
<p>And the question to me is like, I&rsquo;m against that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never be part of that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, I hope not, willingly not.</p>
<p>But like, is there something to be said</p>
<p>to essentially lying to raise money,</p>
<p>like fake it till you make it kind of thing?</p>
<p>I mean, this is Billy McFarland in the Fyre Festival.</p>
<p>Like we all experienced, you know,</p>
<p>what happens with that.</p>
<p>No, no, don&rsquo;t fake it till you make it.</p>
<p>Be honest and hope you make it the whole way.</p>
<p>The technology wins.</p>
<p>Right, the technology wins.</p>
<p>And like, there is, I&rsquo;m not used to like the anti hype,</p>
<p>you know, that&rsquo;s a Slava KPSS reference,</p>
<p>but hype isn&rsquo;t necessarily bad.</p>
<p>I loved camping out for the iPhones, you know,</p>
<p>and as long as the hype is backed by like substance,</p>
<p>as long as it&rsquo;s backed by something I can actually buy,</p>
<p>and like it&rsquo;s real, then hype is great</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a great feeling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when the hype is backed by lies</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a bad feeling.</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of people call Elon Musk a fraud.</p>
<p>How could he be a fraud?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed this, this kind of interesting effect,</p>
<p>which is he does tend to over promise</p>
<p>and deliver, what&rsquo;s the better way to phrase it?</p>
<p>Promise a timeline that he doesn&rsquo;t deliver on,</p>
<p>he delivers much later on.</p>
<p>What do you think about that?</p>
<p>Cause I do that, I think that&rsquo;s a programmer thing too.</p>
<p>I do that as well.</p>
<p>You think that&rsquo;s a really bad thing to do or is that okay?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s, again, as long as like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re working toward it and you&rsquo;re gonna deliver on it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not too far off, right?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Like, you know, the whole autonomous vehicle thing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, I mean, I still think Tesla&rsquo;s on track</p>
<p>to beat us.</p>
<p>I still think even with their missteps,</p>
<p>they have advantages we don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>You know, Elon is better than me</p>
<p>at like marshaling massive amounts of resources.</p>
<p>So, you know, I still think given the fact</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re maybe making some wrong decisions,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll end up winning.</p>
<p>And like, it&rsquo;s fine to hype it</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re actually gonna win, right?</p>
<p>Like if Elon says, look, we&rsquo;re gonna be landing rockets</p>
<p>back on earth in a year and it takes four,</p>
<p>like, you know, he landed a rocket back on earth</p>
<p>and he was working toward it the whole time.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s some amount of like,</p>
<p>I think when it becomes wrong is if you know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna meet that deadline.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re lying.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s brilliantly put.</p>
<p>Like this is what people don&rsquo;t understand, I think.</p>
<p>Like Elon believes everything he says.</p>
<p>He does, as far as I can tell, he does.</p>
<p>And I detected that in myself too.</p>
<p>Like if I, it&rsquo;s only bullshit</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re like conscious of yourself lying.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Now you can&rsquo;t take that to such an extreme, right?</p>
<p>Like in a way, I think maybe Billy McFarland</p>
<p>believed everything he said too.</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s how you start a cult</p>
<p>and everybody kills themselves.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, like it&rsquo;s, you need, you need,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s like some factor on it, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>And you need some people to like, you know,</p>
<p>keep you in check, but like,</p>
<p>if you deliver on most of the things you say</p>
<p>and just the timelines are off, yeah.</p>
<p>It does piss people off though.</p>
<p>I wonder, but who cares?</p>
<p>In a long arc of history, the people,</p>
<p>everybody gets pissed off at the people who succeed,</p>
<p>which is one of the things</p>
<p>that frustrates me about this world,</p>
<p>is they don&rsquo;t celebrate the success of others.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s so many people that want Elon to fail.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so fascinating to me.</p>
<p>Like what is wrong with you?</p>
<p>Like, so Elon Musk talks about like people shorting,</p>
<p>like they talk about financial,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s much bigger than the financials.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen like the human factors community,</p>
<p>they want, they want other people to fail.</p>
<p>Why, why, why?</p>
<p>Like even people, the harshest thing is like,</p>
<p>you know, even people that like seem</p>
<p>to really hate Donald Trump, they want him to fail</p>
<p>or like the other president</p>
<p>or they want Barack Obama to fail.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re all on the same boat, man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird, but I want that,</p>
<p>I would love to inspire that part of the world to change</p>
<p>because damn it, if the human species is gonna survive,</p>
<p>we should celebrate success.</p>
<p>Like it seems like the efficient thing to do</p>
<p>in this objective function that we&rsquo;re all striving for</p>
<p>is to celebrate the ones that like figure out</p>
<p>how to like do better at that objective function</p>
<p>as opposed to like dragging them down back into the mud.</p>
<p>I think there is, this is the speech I always give</p>
<p>about the commenters on Hacker News.</p>
<p>So first off, something to remember</p>
<p>about the internet in general is commenters</p>
<p>are not representative of the population.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t comment on anything.</p>
<p>You know, commenters are representative</p>
<p>of a certain sliver of the population.</p>
<p>And on Hacker News, a common thing I&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>is when you&rsquo;ll see something that&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you know, promises to be wild out there and innovative.</p>
<p>There is some amount of, you know,</p>
<p>checking them back to earth,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also some amount of if this thing succeeds,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m 36 and I&rsquo;ve worked</p>
<p>at large tech companies my whole life.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t succeed because if they succeed,</p>
<p>that would mean that I could have done something different</p>
<p>with my life, but we know that I couldn&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>we know that I couldn&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re gonna fail.</p>
<p>And they have to root for them to fail</p>
<p>to kind of maintain their world image.</p>
<p>So tune it out.</p>
<p>And they comment, well, it&rsquo;s hard, I, so one of the things,</p>
<p>one of the things I&rsquo;m considering startup wise</p>
<p>is to change that.</p>
<p>Cause I think the, I think it&rsquo;s also a technology problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a platform problem.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, because the thing you said,</p>
<p>most people don&rsquo;t comment.</p>
<p>I think most people want to comment.</p>
<p>They just don&rsquo;t because it&rsquo;s all the assholes</p>
<p>who are commenting.</p>
<p>Exactly, I don&rsquo;t want to be grouped in with them.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to be at a party</p>
<p>where everyone is an asshole.</p>
<p>And so they, but that&rsquo;s a platform problem.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe what Reddit&rsquo;s become.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe the group thinking, Reddit comments.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, Reddit is an interesting one</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re subreddits.</p>
<p>And so you can still see, especially small subreddits</p>
<p>that like, that are a little like havens</p>
<p>of like joy and positivity and like deep,</p>
<p>even disagreement, but like nuanced discussion.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s only like small little pockets,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s emergent.</p>
<p>The platform is not helping that or hurting that.</p>
<p>So I guess naturally something about the internet,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t put in a lot of effort to encourage</p>
<p>nuance and positive, good vibes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s naturally going to decline into chaos.</p>
<p>I would love to see someone do this well.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, yeah, very doable.</p>
<p>I think actually, so I feel like Twitter</p>
<p>could be overthrown.</p>
<p>Yashua Bach talked about how like,</p>
<p>if you have like and retweet,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s only positive wiring, right?</p>
<p>The only way to do anything like negative there</p>
<p>is with a comment.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like that asymmetry is what gives,</p>
<p>you know, Twitter its particular toxicness.</p>
<p>Whereas I find YouTube comments to be much better</p>
<p>because YouTube comments have an up and a down</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t show the downvotes.</p>
<p>Without getting into depth of this particular discussion,</p>
<p>the point is to explore possibilities</p>
<p>and get a lot of data on it.</p>
<p>Because I mean, I could disagree with what you just said.</p>
<p>The point is it&rsquo;s unclear.</p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t been explored in a really rich way.</p>
<p>Like these questions of how to create platforms</p>
<p>that encourage positivity.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s a technology problem.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;ll look back at Twitter as it is now.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;ll happen within Twitter,</p>
<p>but most likely somebody overthrows them</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;ll look back at Twitter and say,</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t believe we put up with this level of toxicity.</p>
<p>You need a different business model too.</p>
<p>Any social network that fundamentally has advertising</p>
<p>as a business model, this was in The Social Dilemma,</p>
<p>which I didn&rsquo;t watch, but I liked it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, there&rsquo;s always the, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the product, you&rsquo;re not the,</p>
<p>but they had a nuanced take on it that I really liked.</p>
<p>And it said, the product being sold is influence over you.</p>
<p>The product being sold is literally your,</p>
<p>you know, influence on you.</p>
<p>Like that can&rsquo;t be, if that&rsquo;s your idea, okay.</p>
<p>Well, you know, guess what?</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t not be toxic.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe there&rsquo;s ways to spin it,</p>
<p>like with giving a lot more control to the user</p>
<p>and transparency to see what is happening to them</p>
<p>as opposed to in the shadows, it&rsquo;s possible,</p>
<p>but that can&rsquo;t be the primary source of.</p>
<p>But the users aren&rsquo;t, no one&rsquo;s gonna use that.</p>
<p>It depends, it depends, it depends.</p>
<p>I think that the, you&rsquo;re not going to,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t depend on self awareness of the users.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a longer discussion because you can&rsquo;t depend on it,</p>
<p>but you can reward self awareness.</p>
<p>Like if for the ones who are willing to put in the work</p>
<p>of self awareness, you can reward them and incentivize</p>
<p>and perhaps be pleasantly surprised how many people</p>
<p>are willing to be self aware on the internet.</p>
<p>Like we are in real life.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m putting in a lot of effort with you right now,</p>
<p>being self aware about if I say something stupid or mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll like look at your like body language.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m putting in that effort.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s costly for an introvert, very costly.</p>
<p>But on the internet, fuck it.</p>
<p>Like most people are like, I don&rsquo;t care if this hurts</p>
<p>somebody, I don&rsquo;t care if this is not interesting</p>
<p>or if this is, yeah, it&rsquo;s a mean or whatever.</p>
<p>I think so much of the engagement today on the internet</p>
<p>is so disingenuine too.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not doing this out of a genuine,</p>
<p>this is what you think.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing this just straight up to manipulate others.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re in, you just became an ad.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, let&rsquo;s talk about a fun topic,</p>
<p>which is programming.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another book idea for you.</p>
<p>Let me pitch.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your perfect programming setup?</p>
<p>So like this by George Hots.</p>
<p>So like what, listen, you&rsquo;re.</p>
<p>Give me a MacBook Air, sit me in a corner of a hotel room</p>
<p>and you know I&rsquo;ll still ask you.</p>
<p>So you really don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t fetishize like multiple monitors, keyboard.</p>
<p>Those things are nice and I&rsquo;m not gonna say no to them,</p>
<p>but did they automatically unlock tons of productivity?</p>
<p>No, not at all.</p>
<p>I have definitely been more productive on a MacBook Air</p>
<p>in a corner of a hotel room.</p>
<p>What about IDE?</p>
<p>So which operating system do you love?</p>
<p>What text editor do you use IDE?</p>
<p>What, is there something that is like the perfect,</p>
<p>if you could just say the perfect productivity setup</p>
<p>for George Hots.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It literally doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>You know, I guess I code most of the time in Vim.</p>
<p>Like literally I&rsquo;m using an editor from the 70s.</p>
<p>You know, you didn&rsquo;t make anything better.</p>
<p>Okay, VS code is nice for reading code.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few things that are nice about it.</p>
<p>I think that you can build much better tools.</p>
<p>How like IDA&rsquo;s xrefs work way better than VS codes, why?</p>
<p>Yeah, actually that&rsquo;s a good question, like why?</p>
<p>I still use, sorry, Emacs for most.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually never, I have to confess something dark.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve never used Vim.</p>
<p>I think maybe I&rsquo;m just afraid</p>
<p>that my life has been like a waste.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so, I&rsquo;m not evangelical about Emacs.</p>
<p>I think this.</p>
<p>This is how I feel about TensorFlow versus PyTorch.</p>
<p>Having just like, we&rsquo;ve switched everything to PyTorch now.</p>
<p>Put months into the switch.</p>
<p>I have felt like I&rsquo;ve wasted years on TensorFlow.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe how much better PyTorch is.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used Emacs and Vim, doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s still just my heart.</p>
<p>Somehow I fell in love with Lisp.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, the heart wants what the heart wants.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand it, but it just connected with me.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s the functional language</p>
<p>that first I connected with.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because so many of the AI courses</p>
<p>before the deep learning revolution</p>
<p>were taught with Lisp in mind.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is, but I&rsquo;m stuck with it.</p>
<p>But at the same time, like,</p>
<p>why am I not using a modern ID</p>
<p>for some of these programming?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not that much better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used modern IDs too.</p>
<p>But at the same time, so to just,</p>
<p>well, not to disagree with you,</p>
<p>but like, I like multiple monitors.</p>
<p>Like I have to do work on a laptop</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a pain in the ass.</p>
<p>And also I&rsquo;m addicted to the Kinesis weird keyboard.</p>
<p>You could see there.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you don&rsquo;t have any of that.</p>
<p>You can just be on a MacBook.</p>
<p>I mean, look at work.</p>
<p>I have three 24 inch monitors.</p>
<p>I have a happy hacking keyboard.</p>
<p>I have a Razer Death Hatter mouse, like.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not essential for you.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to a day in the life of George Hots.</p>
<p>What is the perfect day productivity wise?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not talking about like Hunter S. Thompson drugs.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s look at productivity.</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s the day look like, like hour by hour?</p>
<p>Is there any regularities that create</p>
<p>a magical George Hots experience?</p>
<p>I can remember three days in my life.</p>
<p>And I remember these days vividly</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;ve gone through kind of radical transformations</p>
<p>to the way I think.</p>
<p>And what I would give, I would pay $100,000</p>
<p>if I could have one of these days tomorrow.</p>
<p>The days have been so impactful.</p>
<p>And one was first discovering Eliezer Yudkowsky</p>
<p>on the singularity and reading that stuff.</p>
<p>And like, you know, my mind was blown.</p>
<p>The next was discovering the Hutter Prize</p>
<p>and that AI is just compression.</p>
<p>Like finally understanding AIXI and what all of that was.</p>
<p>You know, I like read about it when I was 18, 19,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>And then the fact that like lossless compression</p>
<p>implies intelligence, the day that I was shown that.</p>
<p>And then the third one is controversial.</p>
<p>The day I found a blog called Unqualified Reservations.</p>
<p>And read that and I was like.</p>
<p>Wait, which one is that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, what&rsquo;s the guy&rsquo;s name?</p>
<p>Curtis Yarvin.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So many people tell me I&rsquo;m supposed to talk to him.</p>
<p>Yeah, the day.</p>
<p>He looks, he sounds insane.</p>
<p>Definitely. Or brilliant,</p>
<p>but insane or both, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>The day I found that blog was another like,</p>
<p>this was during like Gamergate</p>
<p>and kind of the run up to the 2016 election.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, wow, okay, the world makes sense now.</p>
<p>This is like, I had a framework now to interpret this.</p>
<p>Just like I got the framework for AI</p>
<p>and a framework to interpret technological progress.</p>
<p>Like those days when I discovered these new frameworks were.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not about, but what was special about those days?</p>
<p>How did those days come to be?</p>
<p>Is it just, you got lucky?</p>
<p>Like, you just encountered a hotter prize</p>
<p>on Hacker News or something like that?</p>
<p>But you see, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>see, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s just that like,</p>
<p>I could have gotten lucky at any point.</p>
<p>I think that in a way.</p>
<p>You were ready at that moment.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>To receive the information.</p>
<p>But is there some magic to the day today</p>
<p>of like eating breakfast?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the mundane things.</p>
<p>Nah.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Nah, I drift through life.</p>
<p>Without structure.</p>
<p>I drift through life hoping and praying</p>
<p>that I will get another day like those days.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s nothing in particular you do</p>
<p>to be a receptacle for another, for day number four.</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t do anything to get the other ones.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think I have to really do anything now.</p>
<p>I took a month long trip to New York</p>
<p>and the Ethereum thing was the highlight of it,</p>
<p>but the rest of it was pretty terrible.</p>
<p>I did a two week road trip</p>
<p>and I got, I had to turn around.</p>
<p>I had to turn around driving in Gunnison, Colorado.</p>
<p>I passed through Gunnison</p>
<p>and the snow starts coming down.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a pass up there called Monarch Pass</p>
<p>in order to get through to Denver,</p>
<p>you gotta get over the Rockies.</p>
<p>And I had to turn my car around.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t, I watched a F150 go off the road.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I gotta go back.</p>
<p>And like that day was meaningful.</p>
<p>Cause like, it was real.</p>
<p>Like I actually had to turn my car around.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rare that anything even real happens in my life.</p>
<p>Even as, you know, mundane as the fact that,</p>
<p>yeah, there was snow, I had to turn around,</p>
<p>stay in Gunnison and leave the next day.</p>
<p>Something about that moment felt real.</p>
<p>Okay, so actually it&rsquo;s interesting to break apart</p>
<p>the three moments you mentioned, if it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>So I always have trouble pronouncing his name,</p>
<p>but Alousa Yurkowski.</p>
<p>So what, how did your worldview change</p>
<p>in starting to consider the exponential growth of AI</p>
<p>and AGI that he thinks about</p>
<p>and the threats of artificial intelligence</p>
<p>and all that kind of ideas?</p>
<p>Can you, is it just like, can you maybe break apart</p>
<p>like what exactly was so magical to you?</p>
<p>Is it transformational experience?</p>
<p>Today, everyone knows him for threats and AI safety.</p>
<p>This was pre that stuff.</p>
<p>There was, I don&rsquo;t think a mention of AI safety on the page.</p>
<p>This is, this is old Yurkowski stuff.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d probably denounce it all now.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d probably be like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s exactly what I didn&rsquo;t want to happen.</p>
<p>Sorry, man.</p>
<p>Is there something specific you can take from his work</p>
<p>that you can remember?</p>
<p>Yeah, it was this realization</p>
<p>that computers double in power every 18 months</p>
<p>and humans do not, and they haven&rsquo;t crossed yet.</p>
<p>But if you have one thing that&rsquo;s doubling every 18 months</p>
<p>and one thing that&rsquo;s staying like this, you know,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s your log graph, here&rsquo;s your line, you know,</p>
<p>calculate that.</p>
<p>And then the data opened the door</p>
<p>to the exponential thinking, like thinking that like,</p>
<p>you know what, with technology,</p>
<p>we can actually transform the world.</p>
<p>It opened the door to human obsolescence.</p>
<p>It opened the door to realize that in my lifetime,</p>
<p>humans are going to be replaced.</p>
<p>And then the matching idea to that of artificial intelligence</p>
<p>with the Hutter prize, you know, I&rsquo;m torn.</p>
<p>I go back and forth on what I think about it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But the basic thesis is it&rsquo;s a nice compelling notion</p>
<p>that we can reduce the task of creating</p>
<p>an intelligent system, a generally intelligent system</p>
<p>into the task of compression.</p>
<p>So you can think of all of intelligence in the universe,</p>
<p>in fact, as a kind of compression.</p>
<p>Do you find that, was that just at the time</p>
<p>you found that as a compelling idea</p>
<p>or do you still find that a compelling idea?</p>
<p>I still find that a compelling idea.</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;s not that useful day to day,</p>
<p>but actually one of maybe my quests before that</p>
<p>was a search for the definition of the word intelligence.</p>
<p>And I never had one.</p>
<p>And I definitely have a definition of the word compression.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very simple, straightforward one.</p>
<p>And you know what compression is,</p>
<p>you know what lossless, it&rsquo;s lossless compression,</p>
<p>not lossy, lossless compression.</p>
<p>And that that is equivalent to intelligence,</p>
<p>which I believe, I&rsquo;m not sure how useful</p>
<p>that definition is day to day,</p>
<p>but like I now have a framework to understand what it is.</p>
<p>And he just 10X the prize for that competition</p>
<p>like recently a few months ago.</p>
<p>You ever thought of taking a crack at that?</p>
<p>Oh, I did.</p>
<p>I spent the next, after I found the prize,</p>
<p>I spent the next six months of my life trying it.</p>
<p>And well, that&rsquo;s when I started learning everything about AI.</p>
<p>And then I worked at Vicarious for a bit</p>
<p>and then I read all the deep learning stuff.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, okay, now I like I&rsquo;m caught up to modern AI.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And I had a really good framework to put it all in</p>
<p>from the compression stuff, right?</p>
<p>Like some of the first deep learning models I played with</p>
<p>were GPT basically, but before transformers,</p>
<p>before it was still RNNs to do character prediction.</p>
<p>But by the way, on the compression side,</p>
<p>I mean, especially with neural networks,</p>
<p>what do you make of the lossless requirement</p>
<p>with the Hutter prize?</p>
<p>So, you know, human intelligence and neural networks</p>
<p>can probably compress stuff pretty well,</p>
<p>but it would be lossy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s imperfect.</p>
<p>You can turn a lossy compression</p>
<p>to a lossless compressor pretty easily</p>
<p>using an arithmetic encoder, right?</p>
<p>You can take an arithmetic encoder</p>
<p>and you can just encode the noise with maximum efficiency.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So even if you can&rsquo;t predict exactly</p>
<p>what the next character is,</p>
<p>the better a probability distribution,</p>
<p>you can put over the next character.</p>
<p>You can then use an arithmetic encoder to, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to know whether it&rsquo;s an E or an I,</p>
<p>you just have to put good probabilities on them</p>
<p>and then, you know, code those.</p>
<p>And if you have, it&rsquo;s a bits of entropy thing, right?</p>
<p>So let me, on that topic,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be interesting as a little side tour.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts in this year about GPT3</p>
<p>and these language models and these transformers?</p>
<p>Is there something interesting to you as an AI researcher,</p>
<p>or is there something interesting to you</p>
<p>as an autonomous vehicle developer?</p>
<p>Nah, I think it&rsquo;s overhyped.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not, like, it&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cool for what it is, but no,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not just gonna be able to scale up to GPT12</p>
<p>and get general purpose intelligence.</p>
<p>Like, your loss function is literally just,</p>
<p>you know, cross entropy loss on the character, right?</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s not the loss function of general intelligence.</p>
<p>Is that obvious to you?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Can you imagine that, like,</p>
<p>to play devil&rsquo;s advocate on yourself,</p>
<p>is it possible that you can,</p>
<p>the GPT12 will achieve general intelligence</p>
<p>with something as dumb as this kind of loss function?</p>
<p>I guess it depends what you mean by general intelligence.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s another problem with the GPTs,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s that they don&rsquo;t have a,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have longterm memory.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So, like, just GPT12,</p>
<p>a scaled up version of GPT2 or GPT3,</p>
<p>I find it hard to believe.</p>
<p>Well, you can scale it in,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a hard coded length,</p>
<p>but you can make it wider and wider and wider.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get cool things from those systems,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re ever gonna get something</p>
<p>that can, like, you know, build me a rocket ship.</p>
<p>What about solved driving?</p>
<p>So, you know, you can use Transformer with video,</p>
<p>for example.</p>
<p>You think, is there something in there?</p>
<p>No, because, I mean, look, we use a GRU.</p>
<p>We use a GRU.</p>
<p>We could change that GRU out to a Transformer.</p>
<p>I think driving is much more Markovian than language.</p>
<p>So, Markovian, you mean, like, the memory,</p>
<p>which aspect of Markovian?</p>
<p>I mean that, like, most of the information</p>
<p>in the state at T minus one is also in state T.</p>
<p>I see, yeah.</p>
<p>Right, and it kind of, like, drops off nicely like this,</p>
<p>whereas sometime with language,</p>
<p>you have to refer back to the third paragraph</p>
<p>on the second page.</p>
<p>I feel like.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not many, like, you can say, like,</p>
<p>speed limit signs, but there&rsquo;s really not many things</p>
<p>in autonomous driving that look like that.</p>
<p>But if you look at, to play devil&rsquo;s advocate,</p>
<p>is the risk estimation thing that you&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>is kind of interesting.</p>
<p>Is, it feels like there might be some longer term</p>
<p>aggregation of context necessary to be able to figure out,</p>
<p>like, the context.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not even sure I&rsquo;m believing my devil&rsquo;s advocate.</p>
<p>We have a nice, like, vision model,</p>
<p>which outputs, like, a one or two,</p>
<p>four dimensional perception space.</p>
<p>Can I try Transformers on it?</p>
<p>Sure, I probably will.</p>
<p>At some point, we&rsquo;ll try Transformers,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll just see.</p>
<p>Do they do better?</p>
<p>Sure, I&rsquo;m.</p>
<p>But it might not be a game changer, you&rsquo;re saying?</p>
<p>No, well, I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>Like, might Transformers work better than GRUs</p>
<p>for autonomous driving?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Might we switch?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Is this some radical change?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay, we use a slightly different,</p>
<p>you know, we switch from RNNs to GRUs.</p>
<p>Like, okay, maybe it&rsquo;s GRUs to Transformers,</p>
<p>but no, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, on the topic of general intelligence,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much I&rsquo;ve talked to you about it.</p>
<p>Like, what, do you think we&rsquo;ll actually build</p>
<p>an AGI?</p>
<p>Like, if you look at Ray Kurzweil with Singularity,</p>
<p>do you have like an intuition about,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind of saying driving is easy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I tend to personally believe that solving driving</p>
<p>will have really deep, important impacts</p>
<p>on our ability to solve general intelligence.</p>
<p>Like, I think driving doesn&rsquo;t require general intelligence,</p>
<p>but I think they&rsquo;re going to be neighbors</p>
<p>in a way that it&rsquo;s like deeply tied.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s so, like driving is so deeply connected</p>
<p>to the human experience that I think solving one</p>
<p>will help solve the other.</p>
<p>But, so I don&rsquo;t see, I don&rsquo;t see driving as like easy</p>
<p>and almost like separate than general intelligence,</p>
<p>but like, what&rsquo;s your vision of a future with a Singularity?</p>
<p>Do you see there&rsquo;ll be a single moment,</p>
<p>like a Singularity where it&rsquo;ll be a phase shift?</p>
<p>Are we in the Singularity now?</p>
<p>Like what, do you have crazy ideas about the future</p>
<p>in terms of AGI?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re definitely in the Singularity now.</p>
<p>We are?</p>
<p>Of course, of course.</p>
<p>Look at the bandwidth between people.</p>
<p>The bandwidth between people goes up, right?</p>
<p>The Singularity is just, you know, when the bandwidth, but.</p>
<p>What do you mean by the bandwidth of people?</p>
<p>Communications, tools, the whole world is networked.</p>
<p>The whole world is networked</p>
<p>and we raise the speed of that network, right?</p>
<p>Oh, so you think the communication of information</p>
<p>in a distributed way is an empowering thing</p>
<p>for collective intelligence?</p>
<p>Oh, I didn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s necessarily a good thing,</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>when I think of the definition of the Singularity,</p>
<p>yeah, it seems kind of right.</p>
<p>I see, like it&rsquo;s a change in the world</p>
<p>beyond which like the world be transformed</p>
<p>in ways that we can&rsquo;t possibly imagine.</p>
<p>No, I mean, I think we&rsquo;re in the Singularity now</p>
<p>in the sense that there&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>one world and a monoculture and it&rsquo;s also linked.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I kind of share the intuition</p>
<p>that the Singularity will originate</p>
<p>from the collective intelligence of us ands</p>
<p>versus the like some single system AGI type thing.</p>
<p>Oh, I totally agree with that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t really believe in like a hard take off AGI</p>
<p>kind of thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t even think AI is all that different in kind</p>
<p>from what we&rsquo;ve already been building.</p>
<p>With respect to driving,</p>
<p>I think driving is a subset of general intelligence</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s a pretty complete subset.</p>
<p>I think the tools we develop at Kama</p>
<p>will also be extremely helpful</p>
<p>to solving general intelligence</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s I think the real reason why I&rsquo;m doing it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care about self driving cars.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cool problem to beat people at.</p>
<p>But yeah, I mean, yeah, you&rsquo;re kind of, you&rsquo;re of two minds.</p>
<p>So one, you do have to have a mission</p>
<p>and you wanna focus and make sure you get there.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t forget that but at the same time,</p>
<p>there is a thread that&rsquo;s much bigger</p>
<p>than that connects the entirety of your effort.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s much bigger than just driving.</p>
<p>With AI and with general intelligence,</p>
<p>it is so easy to delude yourself</p>
<p>into thinking you&rsquo;ve figured something out when you haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If we build a level five self driving car,</p>
<p>we have indisputably built something.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is it general intelligence?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna debate that.</p>
<p>I will say we&rsquo;ve built something</p>
<p>that provides huge financial value.</p>
<p>Yeah, beautifully put.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the engineering credo.</p>
<p>Like just build the thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m with Elon</p>
<p>on go to Mars.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a great one.</p>
<p>You can argue like who the hell cares about going to Mars.</p>
<p>But the reality is set that as a mission, get it done.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re going to crack some problem</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve never even expected</p>
<p>in the process of doing that, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, no, I think if I had a choice</p>
<p>between humanity going to Mars</p>
<p>and solving self driving cars,</p>
<p>I think going to Mars is better, but I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more suited for self driving cars.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an information guy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a modernist, I&rsquo;m a postmodernist.</p>
<p>Postmodernist, all right, beautifully put.</p>
<p>Let me drag you back to programming for a sec.</p>
<p>What three, maybe three to five programming languages</p>
<p>should people learn, do you think?</p>
<p>Like if you look at yourself,</p>
<p>what did you get the most out of from learning?</p>
<p>Well, so everybody should learn C and assembly.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll start with those two, right?</p>
<p>Assembly?</p>
<p>Yeah, if you can&rsquo;t code an assembly,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know what the computer&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t understand like,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to be great in assembly,</p>
<p>but you have to code in it.</p>
<p>And then like, you have to appreciate assembly</p>
<p>in order to appreciate all the great things C gets you.</p>
<p>And then you have to code in C</p>
<p>in order to appreciate all the great things Python gets you.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll just say assembly C and Python,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll start with those three.</p>
<p>The memory allocation of C and the fact that,</p>
<p>so assembly gives you a sense</p>
<p>of just how many levels of abstraction</p>
<p>you get to work on in modern day programming.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, graph coloring for assignment,</p>
<p>register assignment and compilers.</p>
<p>Like, you know, you gotta do,</p>
<p>you know, the compiler,</p>
<p>the computer only has a certain number of registers,</p>
<p>yet you can have all the variables you want in a C function.</p>
<p>So you get to start to build intuition about compilation,</p>
<p>like what a compiler gets you.</p>
<p>What else?</p>
<p>Well, then there&rsquo;s kind of a,</p>
<p>so those are all very imperative programming languages.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s two other paradigms for programming</p>
<p>that everybody should be familiar with.</p>
<p>And one of them is functional.</p>
<p>You should learn Haskell and take that all the way through,</p>
<p>learn a language with dependent types like Coq,</p>
<p>learn that whole space,</p>
<p>like the very PL theory, heavy languages.</p>
<p>And Haskell is your favorite functional?</p>
<p>Is that the go to, you&rsquo;d say?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not a great Haskell programmer.</p>
<p>I wrote a compiler in Haskell once.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another paradigm,</p>
<p>and actually there&rsquo;s one more paradigm</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll even talk about after that,</p>
<p>that I never used to talk about</p>
<p>when I would think about this,</p>
<p>but the next paradigm is learn Verilog of HDL.</p>
<p>Understand this idea of all of the instructions</p>
<p>execute at once. If I have a block in Verilog</p>
<p>and I write stuff in it, it&rsquo;s not sequential.</p>
<p>They all execute at once.</p>
<p>And then think like that, that&rsquo;s how hardware works.</p>
<p>To be, so I guess assembly doesn&rsquo;t quite get you that.</p>
<p>Assembly is more about compilation,</p>
<p>and Verilog is more about the hardware,</p>
<p>like giving a sense of what actually</p>
<p>is the hardware is doing.</p>
<p>Assembly, C, Python are straight,</p>
<p>like they sit right on top of each other.</p>
<p>In fact, C is, well, C is kind of coded in C,</p>
<p>but you could imagine the first C was coded in assembly,</p>
<p>and Python is actually coded in C.</p>
<p>So you can straight up go on that.</p>
<p>Got it, and then Verilog gives you, that&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And then I think there&rsquo;s another one now.</p>
<p>Everyone, Carpathia calls it programming 2.0,</p>
<p>which is learn a, I&rsquo;m not even gonna,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t learn TensorFlow, learn PyTorch.</p>
<p>So machine learning.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got to come up with a better term</p>
<p>than programming 2.0, or, but yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a programming language, learn it.</p>
<p>I wonder if it can be formalized a little bit better.</p>
<p>It feels like we&rsquo;re in the early days</p>
<p>of what that actually entails.</p>
<p>Data driven programming?</p>
<p>Data driven programming, yeah.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s so fundamentally different</p>
<p>as a paradigm than the others.</p>
<p>Like it almost requires a different skillset.</p>
<p>But you think it&rsquo;s still, yeah.</p>
<p>And PyTorch versus TensorFlow, PyTorch wins.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fourth paradigm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fourth paradigm that I&rsquo;ve kind of seen.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like this, you know,</p>
<p>imperative functional hardware.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know a better word for it.</p>
<p>And then ML.</p>
<p>Do you have advice for people that wanna,</p>
<p>you know, get into programming, wanna learn programming?</p>
<p>You have a video,</p>
<p>what is programming noob lessons, exclamation point.</p>
<p>And I think the top comment is like,</p>
<p>warning, this is not for noobs.</p>
<p>Do you have a noob, like a TLDW for that video,</p>
<p>but also a noob friendly advice</p>
<p>on how to get into programming?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re never going to learn programming</p>
<p>by watching a video called Learn Programming.</p>
<p>The only way to learn programming, I think,</p>
<p>and the only one is that the only way</p>
<p>everyone I&rsquo;ve ever met who can program well,</p>
<p>learned it all in the same way.</p>
<p>They had something they wanted to do</p>
<p>and then they tried to do it.</p>
<p>And then they were like, oh, well, okay.</p>
<p>This is kind of, you know, it&rsquo;d be nice</p>
<p>if the computer could kind of do this.</p>
<p>And then, you know, that&rsquo;s how you learn.</p>
<p>You just keep pushing on a project.</p>
<p>So the only advice I have for learning programming</p>
<p>is go program.</p>
<p>Somebody wrote to me a question like,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t really, they&rsquo;re looking to learn</p>
<p>about recurring neural networks.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s saying, like, my company&rsquo;s thinking</p>
<p>of using recurring neural networks for time series data,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t really have an idea of where to use it yet.</p>
<p>We just want to, like, do you have any advice</p>
<p>on how to learn about, these are these kind of</p>
<p>general machine learning questions.</p>
<p>And I think the answer is, like,</p>
<p>actually have a problem that you&rsquo;re trying to solve.</p>
<p>And just.</p>
<p>I see that stuff.</p>
<p>Oh my God, when people talk like that,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, I heard machine learning is important.</p>
<p>Could you help us integrate machine learning</p>
<p>with macaroni and cheese production?</p>
<p>You just, I don&rsquo;t even, you can&rsquo;t help these people.</p>
<p>Like, who lets you run anything?</p>
<p>Who lets that kind of person run anything?</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re all, we&rsquo;re all beginners at some point.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re a beginner.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, my problem is not that they don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about machine learning.</p>
<p>My problem is that they think that machine learning</p>
<p>has something to say about macaroni and cheese production.</p>
<p>Or like, I heard about this new technology.</p>
<p>How can I use it for why?</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know what it is, but how can I use it for why?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>You have to build up an intuition of how,</p>
<p>cause you might be able to figure out a way,</p>
<p>but like the prerequisites,</p>
<p>you should have a macaroni and cheese problem to solve first.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And then two, you should have more traditional,</p>
<p>like the learning process should involve</p>
<p>more traditionally applicable problems</p>
<p>in the space of whatever that is, machine learning,</p>
<p>and then see if it can be applied to mac and cheese.</p>
<p>At least start with, tell me about a problem.</p>
<p>Like if you have a problem, you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>you know, some of my boxes aren&rsquo;t getting</p>
<p>enough macaroni in them.</p>
<p>Can we use machine learning to solve this problem?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s much, much better than how do I apply</p>
<p>machine learning to macaroni and cheese?</p>
<p>One big thing, maybe this is me talking</p>
<p>to the audience a little bit, cause I get these days</p>
<p>so many messages, advice on how to like learn stuff, okay?</p>
<p>My, this is not me being mean.</p>
<p>I think this is quite profound actually,</p>
<p>is you should Google it.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Like one of the like skills that you should really acquire</p>
<p>as an engineer, as a researcher, as a thinker,</p>
<p>like one, there&rsquo;s two complementary skills.</p>
<p>Like one is with a blank sheet of paper</p>
<p>with no internet to think deeply.</p>
<p>And then the other is to Google the crap</p>
<p>out of the questions you have.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s actually a skill people often talk about,</p>
<p>but like doing research, like pulling at the thread,</p>
<p>like looking up different words,</p>
<p>going into like GitHub repositories with two stars</p>
<p>and like looking how they did stuff,</p>
<p>like looking at the code or going on Twitter,</p>
<p>seeing like there&rsquo;s little pockets of brilliant people</p>
<p>that are like having discussions.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re a neuroscientist,</p>
<p>go into signal processing community.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re an AI person going into the psychology community,</p>
<p>like switch communities.</p>
<p>I keep searching, searching, searching,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so much better to invest</p>
<p>in like finding somebody else who already solved your problem</p>
<p>than it is to try to solve the problem.</p>
<p>And because they&rsquo;ve often invested years of their life,</p>
<p>like entire communities are probably already out there</p>
<p>who have tried to solve your problem.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re the same thing.</p>
<p>I think you go try to solve the problem.</p>
<p>And then in trying to solve the problem,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re good at solving problems,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll stumble upon the person who solved it already.</p>
<p>But the stumbling is really important.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a skill that people should really put,</p>
<p>especially in undergrad, like search.</p>
<p>If you ask me a question,</p>
<p>how should I get started in deep learning, like especially?</p>
<p>Like that is just so Googleable.</p>
<p>Like the whole point is you Google that</p>
<p>and you get a million pages and just start looking at them.</p>
<p>Start pulling at the threads, start exploring,</p>
<p>start taking notes, start getting advice</p>
<p>from a million people that already like spent their life</p>
<p>answering that question, actually.</p>
<p>Oh, well, yeah, I mean, that&rsquo;s definitely also, yeah,</p>
<p>when people like ask me things like that, I&rsquo;m like, trust me,</p>
<p>the top answer on Google is much, much better</p>
<p>than anything I&rsquo;m going to tell you, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>People ask, it&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any recommendations.</p>
<p>What three books, technical or fiction or philosophical,</p>
<p>had an impact on your life or you would recommend perhaps?</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll start with the least controversial,</p>
<p>Infinite Jest, Infinite Jest is a&hellip;</p>
<p>David Foster Wallace.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a book about wireheading, really.</p>
<p>Very enjoyable to read, very well written.</p>
<p>You know, you will grow as a person reading this book,</p>
<p>its effort, and I&rsquo;ll set that up for the second book,</p>
<p>which is pornography, it&rsquo;s called Atlas Shrugged,</p>
<p>which&hellip;</p>
<p>Atlas Shrugged is pornography.</p>
<p>I mean, it is, I will not defend the,</p>
<p>I will not say Atlas Shrugged is a well written book.</p>
<p>It is entertaining to read, certainly, just like pornography.</p>
<p>The production value isn&rsquo;t great.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a 60 page monologue in there</p>
<p>that Ann Rand&rsquo;s editor really wanted to take out.</p>
<p>And she paid, she paid out of her pocket</p>
<p>to keep that 60 page monologue in the book.</p>
<p>But it is a great book for a kind of framework</p>
<p>of human relations.</p>
<p>And I know a lot of people are like,</p>
<p>yeah, but it&rsquo;s a terrible framework.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s a framework.</p>
<p>Just for context, in a couple of days,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speaking for probably four plus hours</p>
<p>with Yaron Brook, who&rsquo;s the main living,</p>
<p>remaining objectivist, objectivist.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve always found this philosophy quite interesting</p>
<p>on many levels.</p>
<p>One of how repulsive some percent of,</p>
<p>large percent of the population find it,</p>
<p>which is always, always funny to me</p>
<p>when people are like unable to even read a philosophy</p>
<p>because of some, I think that says more</p>
<p>about their psychological perspective on it.</p>
<p>But there is something about objectivism</p>
<p>and Ann Rand&rsquo;s philosophy that&rsquo;s deeply connected</p>
<p>to this idea of capitalism,</p>
<p>of the ethical life is the productive life</p>
<p>that was always compelling to me.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t seem as, like I didn&rsquo;t seem to interpret it</p>
<p>in the negative sense that some people do.</p>
<p>To be fair, I read that book when I was 19.</p>
<p>So you had an impact at that point, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the bad guys in the book have this slogan</p>
<p>from each according to their ability</p>
<p>to each according to their need.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m looking at this and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>these are the most cart,</p>
<p>this is team rocket level cartoonishness, right?</p>
<p>No bad guy.</p>
<p>And then when I realized that was actually the slogan</p>
<p>of the communist party, I&rsquo;m like, wait a second.</p>
<p>Wait, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re telling me this really happened?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the criticisms of her work</p>
<p>is she has a cartoonish view of good and evil.</p>
<p>Like the reality, as Jordan Peterson says,</p>
<p>is that each of us have the capacity for good and evil</p>
<p>in us as opposed to like, there&rsquo;s some characters</p>
<p>who are purely evil and some characters that are purely good.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s in a way why it&rsquo;s pornographic.</p>
<p>The production value, I love it.</p>
<p>Like evil is punished and there&rsquo;s very clearly,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no, just like porn doesn&rsquo;t have character growth.</p>
<p>Well, you know, neither does Alice Shrugged, like.</p>
<p>Really, well put.</p>
<p>But at 19 year old George Hots, it was good enough.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the third?</p>
<p>You have something?</p>
<p>I could give, these two I&rsquo;ll just throw out.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sci fi.</p>
<p>Perputation City.</p>
<p>Great thing to start thinking about copies of yourself.</p>
<p>And then the&hellip;</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s that by?</p>
<p>Sorry, I didn&rsquo;t catch that.</p>
<p>That is Greg Egan.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a, that might not be his real name.</p>
<p>Some Australian guy, might not be Australian.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And then this one&rsquo;s online.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a story set in a post singularity world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Is there, can you, either of the worlds,</p>
<p>do you find something philosophical interesting in them</p>
<p>that you can comment on?</p>
<p>I mean, it is clear to me that</p>
<p>Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect is like written by</p>
<p>an engineer, which is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very almost a pragmatic take on a utopia, in a way.</p>
<p>Positive or negative?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s up to you to decide reading the book.</p>
<p>And the ending of it is very interesting as well.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t realize what it was.</p>
<p>I first read that when I was 15.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve reread that book several times in my life.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s short, it&rsquo;s 50 pages.</p>
<p>Everyone should go read it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s, sorry, it&rsquo;s a little tangent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working through the foundation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been, I haven&rsquo;t read much sci fi my whole life</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m trying to fix that the last few months.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been a little side project.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s to you as the greatest sci fi novel</p>
<p>that people should read?</p>
<p>Or is that?</p>
<p>I mean, I would, yeah, I would say like, yeah,</p>
<p>Permutation City, Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t like Foundation.</p>
<p>I thought it was way too modernist.</p>
<p>You like Dune and all of those.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never read Dune.</p>
<p>I have to read it.</p>
<p>Fire Upon the Deep is interesting.</p>
<p>Okay, I mean, look, everyone should read,</p>
<p>everyone should read Neuromancer.</p>
<p>Everyone should read Snow Crash.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t read those, like start there.</p>
<p>Yeah, I haven&rsquo;t read Snow Crash.</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t read Snow Crash?</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s, I mean, it&rsquo;s very entertaining.</p>
<p>Go to Lesher Bach.</p>
<p>And if you want the controversial one,</p>
<p>Bronze Age Mindset.</p>
<p>All right, I&rsquo;ll look into that one.</p>
<p>Those aren&rsquo;t sci fi, but just to round out books.</p>
<p>So a bunch of people asked me on Twitter</p>
<p>and Reddit and so on for advice.</p>
<p>So what advice would you give a young person today</p>
<p>about life?</p>
<p>In other words, what, yeah, I mean, looking back,</p>
<p>especially when you were younger, you did,</p>
<p>and you continued it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve accomplished a lot of interesting things.</p>
<p>Is there some advice from those,</p>
<p>from that life of yours that you can pass on?</p>
<p>If college ever opens again,</p>
<p>I would love to give a graduation speech.</p>
<p>At that point, I will put a lot of somewhat satirical effort</p>
<p>into this question.</p>
<p>Yeah, at this, you haven&rsquo;t written anything at this point.</p>
<p>Oh, you know what?</p>
<p>Always wear sunscreen.</p>
<p>This is water.</p>
<p>Pick your plagiarizing.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, but that&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the like clean your room.</p>
<p>You know, yeah, you can plagiarize from all of this stuff.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, there is no,</p>
<p>self help books aren&rsquo;t designed to help you.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re designed to make you feel good.</p>
<p>Like whatever advice I could give, you already know.</p>
<p>Everyone already knows.</p>
<p>Sorry, it doesn&rsquo;t feel good.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Like, you know, you know,</p>
<p>if I tell you that you should, you know,</p>
<p>eat well and read more and it&rsquo;s not gonna do anything.</p>
<p>I think the whole like genre</p>
<p>of those kinds of questions is meaningless.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>If anything, it&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t worry so much about that stuff.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be so caught up in your head.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re, yeah.</p>
<p>In a sense that your whole life,</p>
<p>your whole existence is like moving version of that advice.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something, I mean,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something in you that resists</p>
<p>that kind of thinking and that in itself is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just illustrative of who you are.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something to learn from that.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re clearly not overthinking stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a gut thing.</p>
<p>Even when I talk about my advice,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, my advice is only relevant to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not relevant to anybody else.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying you should go out.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re the kind of person who overthinks things</p>
<p>to stop overthinking things, it&rsquo;s not bad.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t work for me.</p>
<p>Maybe it works for you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about love.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think last time we talked about the meaning of life</p>
<p>and it was kind of about winning.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve talked to you about love much,</p>
<p>whether romantic or just love</p>
<p>for the common humanity amongst us all.</p>
<p>What role has love played in your life?</p>
<p>In this quest for winning, where does love fit in?</p>
<p>Well, the word love, I think means several different things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s love in the sense of, maybe I could just say,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like love in the sense of opiates</p>
<p>and love in the sense of oxytocin</p>
<p>and then love in the sense of,</p>
<p>maybe like a love for math.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it fits into either</p>
<p>of those first two paradigms.</p>
<p>So each of those, have they given something to you</p>
<p>in your life?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not that big of a fan of the first two.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>The same reason I&rsquo;m not a fan of,</p>
<p>the same reason I don&rsquo;t do opiates and don&rsquo;t take ecstasy.</p>
<p>And there were times, look, I&rsquo;ve tried both.</p>
<p>I liked opiates way more than I liked ecstasy,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not, the ethical life is the productive life.</p>
<p>So maybe that&rsquo;s my problem with those.</p>
<p>And then like, yeah, a sense of, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>like abstract love for humanity.</p>
<p>I mean, the abstract love for humanity,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yeah, I&rsquo;ve always felt that.</p>
<p>And I guess it&rsquo;s hard for me to imagine</p>
<p>not feeling it and maybe there&rsquo;s people who don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s just like a background thing that&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>I mean, since we brought up drugs, let me ask you,</p>
<p>this is becoming more and more a part of my life</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m talking to a few researchers</p>
<p>that are working on psychedelics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve eaten shrooms a couple of times</p>
<p>and it was fascinating to me that like the mind can go,</p>
<p>like just fascinating the mind can go to places</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t imagine it could go.</p>
<p>And it was very friendly and positive and exciting</p>
<p>and everything was kind of hilarious in the place.</p>
<p>Wherever my mind went, that&rsquo;s where I went.</p>
<p>Is, what do you think about psychedelics?</p>
<p>Do you think they have, where do you think the mind goes?</p>
<p>Have you done psychedelics?</p>
<p>Where do you think the mind goes?</p>
<p>Is there something useful to learn about the places it goes</p>
<p>once you come back?</p>
<p>I find it interesting that this idea</p>
<p>that psychedelics have something to teach</p>
<p>is almost unique to psychedelics, right?</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t argue this about amphetamines.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not really sure why.</p>
<p>I think all of the drugs have lessons to teach.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s things to learn from opiates.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s things to learn from amphetamines.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s things to learn from psychedelics,</p>
<p>things to learn from marijuana.</p>
<p>But also at the same time recognize</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re learning things about the world.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re learning things about yourself.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And, you know, what&rsquo;s the, even, it might&rsquo;ve even been,</p>
<p>might&rsquo;ve even been a Timothy Leary quote.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna misquote him,</p>
<p>but the idea is basically like, you know,</p>
<p>everybody should look behind the door,</p>
<p>but then once you&rsquo;ve seen behind the door,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to keep going back.</p>
<p>So, I mean, and that&rsquo;s my thoughts on all real drug use too.</p>
<p>Except maybe for caffeine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little experience that is good to have, but.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, no, I mean, yeah, I guess,</p>
<p>yes, psychedelics are definitely.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a fan of new experiences, I suppose.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Because they all contain a little,</p>
<p>especially the first few times,</p>
<p>it contains some lessons that can be picked up.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I&rsquo;ll revisit psychedelics maybe once a year.</p>
<p>Usually smaller doses.</p>
<p>Maybe they turn up the learning rate of your brain.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that, I like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>Big learning rates have pros and cons.</p>
<p>Last question, and this is a little weird one,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve called yourself crazy in the past.</p>
<p>First of all, on a scale of one to 10,</p>
<p>how crazy would you say are you?</p>
<p>Oh, I mean, it depends how you, you know,</p>
<p>when you compare me to Elon Musk and Anthony Levandowski,</p>
<p>not so crazy.</p>
<p>So like a seven?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go with six.</p>
<p>Six, six, six.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Well, I like seven, seven&rsquo;s a good number.</p>
<p>Seven, all right, well, I&rsquo;m sure day by day it changes,</p>
<p>right, so, but you&rsquo;re in that area.</p>
<p>In thinking about that,</p>
<p>what do you think is the role of madness?</p>
<p>Is that a feature or a bug</p>
<p>if you were to dissect your brain?</p>
<p>So, okay, from like a mental health lens on crazy,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I really believe in that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I really believe in like a lot of that stuff.</p>
<p>Right, this concept of, okay, you know,</p>
<p>when you get over to like hardcore bipolar and schizophrenia,</p>
<p>these things are clearly real, somewhat biological.</p>
<p>And then over here on the spectrum,</p>
<p>you have like ADD and oppositional defiance disorder</p>
<p>and these things that are like,</p>
<p>wait, this is normal spectrum human behavior.</p>
<p>Like this isn&rsquo;t, you know, where&rsquo;s the line here</p>
<p>and why is this like a problem?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this whole, you know,</p>
<p>the neurodiversity of humanity is huge.</p>
<p>Like people think I&rsquo;m always on drugs.</p>
<p>People are saying this to me on my streams.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, guys, you know,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m real open with my drug use.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d tell you if I was on drugs and yeah,</p>
<p>I had like a cup of coffee this morning,</p>
<p>but other than that, this is just me.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re witnessing my brain in action.</p>
<p>So the word madness doesn&rsquo;t even make sense</p>
<p>in the rich neurodiversity of humans.</p>
<p>I think it makes sense, but only for like</p>
<p>some insane extremes.</p>
<p>Like if you are actually like visibly hallucinating,</p>
<p>you know, that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>But there is the kind of spectrum on which you stand out.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s like, if I were to look, you know,</p>
<p>at decorations on a Christmas tree or something like that,</p>
<p>like if you were a decoration, that would catch my eye.</p>
<p>Like that thing is sparkly, whatever the hell that thing is.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something to that.</p>
<p>Just like refusing to be boring</p>
<p>or maybe boring is the wrong word,</p>
<p>but to yeah, I mean, be willing to sparkle, you know?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like somewhat constructed.</p>
<p>I mean, I am who I choose to be.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna say things as true as I can see them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna lie.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a really important feature in itself.</p>
<p>So like whatever the neurodiversity of your,</p>
<p>whatever your brain is, not putting constraints on it</p>
<p>that force it to fit into the mold of what society is like,</p>
<p>defines what you&rsquo;re supposed to be.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re one of the specimens</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t mind being yourself.</p>
<p>Being right is super important,</p>
<p>except at the expense of being wrong.</p>
<p>Without breaking that apart,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a beautiful way to end it.</p>
<p>George, you&rsquo;re one of the most special humans I know.</p>
