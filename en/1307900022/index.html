    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>And now, the show with the most handsome voice talent</p>
<p>working today, It&rsquo;s Common Sense with Bill Barrett,</p>
<p>hosted by that Dan Carlin guy.</p>
<p>That voice that you heard just there in the introduction</p>
<p>as he said himself, was Bill Barrett.</p>
<p>The number one choice that I would have had</p>
<p>if somebody had said to me in 2005,</p>
<p>when we started podcasting, that you could have any&hellip;</p>
<p>sort of big voice announcer in the entire world,</p>
<p>who would you pick?</p>
<p>And I would pick Bill Barrett,</p>
<p>for reasons that will become apparent,</p>
<p>I think, as we talk about him.</p>
<p>We lost him yesterday,</p>
<p>um, August 17th, 2022, to cancer,</p>
<p>as so many of us have lost friends and relatives</p>
<p>to that terrible disease.</p>
<p>And in Bill&rsquo;s case, I wanted to do this tribute</p>
<p>because of all he&rsquo;s done for us.</p>
<p>I hope that Bill&rsquo;s family and friends are okay with this.</p>
<p>Um, but given all that he&rsquo;s done for us,</p>
<p>it would be ungrateful, I think,</p>
<p>to not celebrate this amazing person.</p>
<p>And first of all, point out that what you hear</p>
<p>when you hear Bill in any of our shows</p>
<p>is a tiny fraction of what Bill does.</p>
<p>Bill was not a voice announcer as a main gig.</p>
<p>That was just sort of a little side gig he did.</p>
<p>Bill was a star.</p>
<p>In the Pacific Northwest, up here,</p>
<p>and in country music radio, Bill is a celebrity.</p>
<p>I mean, this is a guy who has gone</p>
<p>into the country radio hall of fame.</p>
<p>He spent almost half a century in radio,</p>
<p>just in the area that I live in.</p>
<p>Even longer, if you include outside that area,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a three-time winner of the country music</p>
<p>small market on-air personality of the year.</p>
<p>I mean, this is a guy that is huge</p>
<p>and could have been in New York or Los Angeles</p>
<p>or any of the big radio markets had he wanted to,</p>
<p>but like so many of the media people</p>
<p>that end up in places like Eugene, Oregon,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of small cities out there</p>
<p>that fall into a similar category</p>
<p>where you get these media people</p>
<p>who should be on their way up to New York</p>
<p>or Los Angeles or Chicago or one of those places,</p>
<p>but finds that the quality of life is such</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ll trade the success and the perks</p>
<p>that would have come with something</p>
<p>like a New York radio gig, right?</p>
<p>The number one media market in the country,</p>
<p>which Bill could have easily worked in</p>
<p>for the overall life satisfaction</p>
<p>that comes with working in a place like this.</p>
<p>The first reporting job I ever had</p>
<p>was in Eugene, Oregon,</p>
<p>and we used to joke at the station that we worked at</p>
<p>that it was view in lieu of pay,</p>
<p>but the view was fantastic.</p>
<p>The view for Bill Barrett was fantastic.</p>
<p>He was&hellip;</p>
<p>the number one guy forever here,</p>
<p>and when he went from KUGN Radio,</p>
<p>you know, with the number one country show,</p>
<p>and moved to another station,</p>
<p>they instantly had the number one country show,</p>
<p>which showed you it wasn&rsquo;t about song programming,</p>
<p>programmers, decisions on marketing or branding</p>
<p>or contests or anything like that,</p>
<p>it was Bill and his co-host, Tim Fox,</p>
<p>who, by the way, I&rsquo;ve known Bill for almost 30 years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known Tim longer.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the first media person, I think,</p>
<p>outside of the station that I worked in</p>
<p>that I met when I came to Oregon,</p>
<p>and the perfect piece of chemistry</p>
<p>that made the whole Bill Barrett thing</p>
<p>greater than the sum of its parts,</p>
<p>and they always had a third person.</p>
<p>Tracy Berry did it, and Tracy Berry&rsquo;s been doing it</p>
<p>as of recently, and she&rsquo;s fabulous.</p>
<p>My wife did it for years.</p>
<p>Co-host to Bill Barrett and Tim Fox,</p>
<p>the bear and the fox, as they were called.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what Bill Barrett was like, by the way.</p>
<p>If you combine, like, one part Jonathan Winters,</p>
<p>there was a little bit of Jonathan Winters in Bill,</p>
<p>in the sense that he was an improvisational genius,</p>
<p>and I could schedule a ten-minute recording session</p>
<p>with him, and 40 minutes later, we&rsquo;re still,</p>
<p>you know, riffing off stuff, and Bill is giving me stuff</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t write for liners that just came to him</p>
<p>off the top of his head, and you&rsquo;d end up</p>
<p>with wonderful stuff, and just this wonderful little session</p>
<p>with this fabulous personality,</p>
<p>whose idea of calling somebody a bad name,</p>
<p>by the way, sometimes was, you know,</p>
<p>usually was something like Knucklehead.</p>
<p>A mixture of, like, Jonathan Winters</p>
<p>and, like, the big bear from the Jungle Book.</p>
<p>Cartoon, Baloo, without the hipster side of him.</p>
<p>And Bear was one of his nicknames, right?</p>
<p>The bear and the fox, and Tim Fox, like I said,</p>
<p>the perfect, uber-talented foil for Bill&rsquo;s work,</p>
<p>and then the third person in there.</p>
<p>I mean, he was just awesome.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>And could&rsquo;ve been a star anywhere.</p>
<p>I told Ben, at the time, if there was, or is,</p>
<p>or will be a Ben, the once and future producer</p>
<p>of this program, when we got Bill to agree</p>
<p>to do this for us, I said,</p>
<p>we just got the best announcer in the world.</p>
<p>The number one guy I would&rsquo;ve chosen from anywhere.</p>
<p>And, God, he was wonderful. And early on,</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re in 2005, and podcasting is an uber-amateur affair,</p>
<p>to have somebody that sounded like</p>
<p>one of the major broadcast networks</p>
<p>brought in a big voice to do this,</p>
<p>set us apart from the get-go.</p>
<p>From the very get-go. I mean, Bill, he wouldn&rsquo;t make,</p>
<p>I mean, he wouldn&rsquo;t think twice about it,</p>
<p>because he was really an old radio guy</p>
<p>that podcasts never really registered with him.</p>
<p>But, I mean, he must have been one of the first</p>
<p>big, professional voice announcers ever to appear</p>
<p>on a podcast. I mean, I&rsquo;m not saying he was the first</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know any better,</p>
<p>and there were other people out there,</p>
<p>but he must have been one of the very early pioneers.</p>
<p>And on the Hardcore History Show,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve always been very straight with the marketing</p>
<p>and the branding and the imaging, as they call it in radio.</p>
<p>But with Common Sense, which was our political</p>
<p>and current events show, we always tried</p>
<p>to take the edge off what was to come.</p>
<p>And besides me being loud, and talking very fast,</p>
<p>and having an edge that I would say was passionate,</p>
<p>but critics might say was angry,</p>
<p>I think the self-deprecating sort of marketing</p>
<p>and branding and imaging that we did,</p>
<p>and the turning lemons into lemonade,</p>
<p>you know, making something like loud, angry,</p>
<p>fast-talking people into a plus,</p>
<p>all that sort of stuff was meant to offset</p>
<p>the downsides of what you were gonna get with me.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s funny is all the radical stuff from years ago</p>
<p>that I used to have to warn the audience about,</p>
<p>the political, like, midline, or median attitudes</p>
<p>in places like the United States,</p>
<p>but maybe the whole world, has moved so far</p>
<p>that the stuff I was trying to, you know,</p>
<p>sort of cushion the blow for my audience back then,</p>
<p>in terms of, you know, what you&rsquo;re about to hear</p>
<p>may shock you, but don&rsquo;t worry,</p>
<p>it all seemed pretty darn&hellip;</p>
<p>blase now, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how extreme things are.</p>
<p>But that has nothing to do with Bill Barrett.</p>
<p>He helped put this show on the map, I think,</p>
<p>and give us a sense where&hellip;</p>
<p>when listeners might give you a few seconds</p>
<p>to see if this was worth listening</p>
<p>to any more of this podcast.</p>
<p>Back in the early days of podcasting,</p>
<p>I mean, all you had to do is listen sometimes</p>
<p>to the audio quality to know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to listen to any more after 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Bill made you realize that,</p>
<p>Bill made you realize right away,</p>
<p>whoa, what is this?</p>
<p>And it was because he had a voice that just&hellip;</p>
<p>forced you to sort of prick up your ears and listen.</p>
<p>Let me say at the outset here,</p>
<p>that what you&rsquo;re about to hear</p>
<p>turns out to be a little self-serving.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t intentional, but what Bill did for us</p>
<p>was all of this branding and imaging and marketing.</p>
<p>And so, the only thing of Bill&rsquo;s work,</p>
<p>the only pieces of Bill&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>that I have the rights to rebroadcast,</p>
<p>are the stuff he did for us.</p>
<p>And so, he&rsquo;s doing such a great job</p>
<p>of branding and imaging for us,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way for me to expose you</p>
<p>to some of Bill&rsquo;s stuff without it reflecting&hellip;</p>
<p>positively on us. And once again, I suppose,</p>
<p>that I am piggybacking on Bill&rsquo;s talent</p>
<p>for my own benefit.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;d have some wonderful comeback line</p>
<p>if I had said that to him.</p>
<p>But let me expose you to a little bit of a guy</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been a part of my and my wife&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>for almost 30 years,</p>
<p>and who we are all, especially in this neck of the woods,</p>
<p>a lot poorer now that he&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>The fabulous Bill Barrett.</p>
<p>Hi, this is Bill.</p>
<p>Dan doesn&rsquo;t have time to solicit, so I will.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the panhandler of podcasting.</p>
<p>Would you make a donation, please?</p>
<p>If not, we&rsquo;re gonna send somebody to your house.</p>
<p>You better protect your kneecaps.</p>
<p>Thank yous all very much.</p>
<p>Welcome to Common Sense with Dan Carlin.</p>
<p>For Russian, press one.</p>
<p>For German, press two.</p>
<p>For any Latin-based Romance languages, press three.</p>
<p>Welcome to the people of France</p>
<p>who are listening to The Common Sense.</p>
<p>We say vive la France and vive la&hellip;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see, vive la intelligence.</p>
<p>Congratulations for thinking outside the bun.</p>
<p>You Europeans and Pacific Rim people,</p>
<p>yeah, I&rsquo;m looking at you, Australia.</p>
<p>You people are just as susceptible to guilt</p>
<p>as everyone else.</p>
<p>So put a little shrimp on the barbie for Dan and Ben,</p>
<p>because we know where you live, in Australia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lovely day down under,</p>
<p>but more important, a nice day to catch up with Dan Carlin.</p>
<p>Well, finally, Igor.</p>
<p>I have all the ingredients to create my masterpiece.</p>
<p>Mix one part liberal, one part conservative.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>Add a dash of libertarian, a pinch of radical,</p>
<p>and a snifter of moderation, plus a bucket of pragmatism.</p>
<p>And behold, my new creation.</p>
<p>Ha-ha-ha. Neo-prudentism.</p>
<p>Master, we need to find a better name.</p>
<p>I know. How about Common Sense?</p>
<p>I was the guy who wrote the copy for Bill,</p>
<p>except when he improvised, which was all the time.</p>
<p>And he would take what I had written</p>
<p>and become the creative talent equivalent</p>
<p>of a force multiplier,</p>
<p>and make a bunch of sort of drab words on a page sing,</p>
<p>sometimes literally, with everything from accents</p>
<p>to celebrity impersonations,</p>
<p>to characters in a movie,</p>
<p>to characters that only Bill knew where they came from.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example.</p>
<p>This Dan Carlin stole a whole idea</p>
<p>for a Common Sense show from Russia.</p>
<p>In old Soviet Union, it was called Communist Sense.</p>
<p>Of course, we sons of Ireland count Dan Carlin</p>
<p>as one of our own.</p>
<p>You see, dispensing clear-headed analysis</p>
<p>in an entertaining fashion is an age-old Irish tradition.</p>
<p>Ah, fuffer and thuckethash.</p>
<p>Dan is one of those unique people.</p>
<p>He just has an innate ability to see both sides of an issue,</p>
<p>and then get mad about both of them.</p>
<p>Oh, Father, I&rsquo;m so confused.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about it, son. So is he.</p>
<p>Celebrity voice impersonated.</p>
<p>Das ist richtig. Backw√§rts und sideways.</p>
<p>We always get there first.</p>
<p>This Common Sense racket&hellip;</p>
<p>This, uh, this, uh, this, uh, this Common Sense racket,</p>
<p>yeah, used to be independent.</p>
<p>Yeah, used to be, uh, independent.</p>
<p>Now that this Dan Carlin guy&rsquo;s gotten it off the ground,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re moving in on his territory.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Hey, why not?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re nonpartisan, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re practical neoprudentists, too.</p>
<p>And if the host of a podcast needs to, like,</p>
<p>get whacked sometimes, or perhaps just tied up in a cellar,</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s just Common Sense.</p>
<p>Maybe not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a judgment call.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a judgment call.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>Bill&rsquo;s humor was instrumental in setting the right tone</p>
<p>for the current events political show that we did,</p>
<p>which was gonna be intense and, you know,</p>
<p>all passionate and all that sort of stuff.</p>
<p>And when Bill would lead off the entire affair,</p>
<p>sort of setting the tone with some humor,</p>
<p>it was the perfect yin and yang combination.</p>
<p>It gave a real sense that while we might be very interested</p>
<p>and involved in what we were talking about,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t take ourselves too seriously.</p>
<p>We had recurring characters that Bill kept bringing,</p>
<p>uh, into the opens, and then, uh, a segment</p>
<p>where people would supposedly have written letters</p>
<p>to the show, and Bill would read them.</p>
<p>And here, the man of a thousand voices would read</p>
<p>these supposed letters from all over the planet,</p>
<p>and they would sound exactly the same,</p>
<p>like it was a, you know, American from Middle America.</p>
<p>Check out what I&rsquo;m talking about here,</p>
<p>and think of how very different it was to have somebody</p>
<p>put a little smile on your face</p>
<p>before you dove into politics and current events.</p>
<p>When was the last time you saw those two things</p>
<p>mixed together, right?</p>
<p>A Mrs. Kayak Khan of Karakora, Mongolia writes,</p>
<p>A Mr. Vinny Boom Bats of the Amazon Rainforest writes,</p>
<p>A Mr&hellip;.</p>
<p>-&hellip;from the Kalahari Desert writes,</p>
<p>Hey, guys, I love the show.</p>
<p>One question, though.</p>
<p>How do you all deal with Dan&rsquo;s intensity level</p>
<p>on a day-to-day basis?</p>
<p>It must be a grind.</p>
<p>Yes, mister, I can&rsquo;t pronounce your name, it is.</p>
<p>I deal with it by having as little to actually do</p>
<p>with Dan as possible.</p>
<p>And Ben, the engineer?</p>
<p>Ha ha ha.</p>
<p>Ben is just screwed.</p>
<p>How do I remember that Dan Collin guy?</p>
<p>He was a punk.</p>
<p>A Mr. R. Nader writes,</p>
<p>Fellas, I loved the show.</p>
<p>Until the recent news hit that you were bought</p>
<p>by Cybertech Digisoft.</p>
<p>I mean, with the leather jackets, with the hair.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, the hair.</p>
<p>Am I to believe that the billions of dollars</p>
<p>that such a giant corporation confunneled to Dan</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t change his independent perspective?</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re smiling, when you&rsquo;re smiling,</p>
<p>the whole world&rsquo;s got common sense for crying out loud.</p>
<p>I wish I could sing like, I don&rsquo;t know, like Dan Collin.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a scary thought.</p>
<p>Well, thanks for asking, Mr. Nader.</p>
<p>Just like our legislature,</p>
<p>the host of common sense is completely uncorruptible.</p>
<p>Whomever that person might turn out to be.</p>
<p>After all, Dan Collin is just a symbol.</p>
<p>A symbol of Cybertech Digisoft.</p>
<p>Cybertech Digisoft.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s good, we&rsquo;ll buy it, and then sell it back to you.</p>
<p>A buck a show, or we&rsquo;ll call the cops.</p>
<p>One thing that Bill never got on the show</p>
<p>was why I was doing the self-deprecating stuff.</p>
<p>And he would tease me and sometimes just laugh out loud</p>
<p>when he would read the liners that I&rsquo;d written.</p>
<p>And he would see the self-deprecating comments</p>
<p>I would make.</p>
<p>And it was a way of offsetting what comes off sometimes</p>
<p>maybe as a know-it-all, or an arrogance that in reality,</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t think is there,</p>
<p>but Bill didn&rsquo;t think was there.</p>
<p>He wouldn&rsquo;t have come back with the sort of things he did,</p>
<p>which, well, you could listen to his reaction sometimes</p>
<p>when he would hear the ways we would approach</p>
<p>the branding or the imaging.</p>
<p>And he would always try when he could</p>
<p>to slip in something of his own</p>
<p>that had a positive thing instead of the sorts of things</p>
<p>I used to write for myself.</p>
<p>Well, Mr. Cowell, thanks for pointing out</p>
<p>the elephant in the living room.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t figured out Dan&rsquo;s got a way too high</p>
<p>an opinion of himself, you&rsquo;ve never worked with him.</p>
<p>Take it from me, he shares more qualities</p>
<p>with William Shatner than just his voice.</p>
<p>Way to run yourself down, Dan.</p>
<p>Smothering you in mushrooms and onions since 1994.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s Dan Carlin, and this is Common Sense.</p>
<p>What the hell did that mean?</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t care for this episode?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re probably not alone.</p>
<p>The good news is there are lots of past shows available</p>
<p>from dancarlin.com.</p>
<p>A mere 99 cents will get you an instant download</p>
<p>of one of the classic Common Sense shows of the past.</p>
<p>Back when it was worth paying for.</p>
<p>Go to dancarlin.com.</p>
<p>Boy, you&rsquo;re really back-selling your show here.</p>
<p>If you think something&rsquo;s missing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably the Ritalin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, keep beating yourself up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have to come over there and slap you.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, Bill had a Jonathan Winters</p>
<p>sort of vibe to him in terms of his ability</p>
<p>to just come out with stuff spontaneously</p>
<p>and endlessly in turning our, you know,</p>
<p>short little recording sessions into rather,</p>
<p>you know, long, enjoyable affairs.</p>
<p>And I laughed listening to some of these raw tapes.</p>
<p>I mean, the funny thing is, is Bill could, you know,</p>
<p>chastise me for my self-deprecating liners</p>
<p>that I wrote, but he had no problem having some fun with me</p>
<p>in some of the ad-lib statements.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, listen to this stuff.</p>
<p>Giving you common sense, giving you twice,</p>
<p>giving you more bullshit than you can handle.</p>
<p>Dan Carlin.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a jokester, he&rsquo;s a prankster,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a sometimes wannabe wankster, he&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Dan Carlin.</p>
<p>I just wanna love him and pet him and hug him</p>
<p>until he starts talking, George.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you some hardcore history.</p>
<p>How about my last prostate exam?</p>
<p>Well, thanks for asking, Mr. Swaggart.</p>
<p>Even though Dan can be pious, self-righteous,</p>
<p>and overdramatic, and he likes to do</p>
<p>a little self-anointing now and then,</p>
<p>he comes by it naturally.</p>
<p>No experience necessary.</p>
<p>Living proof of what happens when cousins marry.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s Dan Carlin, and this is Common Sense.</p>
<p>Bill had the ability to talk in a high range</p>
<p>all the way to the low range, and he called the low range</p>
<p>the red zone.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s an NFL reference, but I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>But we loved the red zone voice,</p>
<p>and we would have Bill so often do multiple versions</p>
<p>of different things that we wrote</p>
<p>in a bunch of different voices, but we, you know,</p>
<p>when he got to that red zone voice,</p>
<p>that just hit the sweet spot for us.</p>
<p>I mean, listen to some of these examples</p>
<p>of Bill going way down in the range</p>
<p>of something that sounds like an old NFL film&rsquo;s production</p>
<p>with some classic voice from the 50s or 60s.</p>
<p>You know, in that announcer range</p>
<p>that is just so rare.</p>
<p>It seems like everybody with a political show</p>
<p>has a deep voice to intro the material.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s play.</p>
<p>-&hellip;(COUGHS TENSELY), okay, let&rsquo;s play like the big boys.</p>
<p>And now, Dan Carlin.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason it doesn&rsquo;t sound like the old media.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s the new media.</p>
<p>Taking you to non-partisan places you&rsquo;ve never been to</p>
<p>and leaving you there.</p>
<p>I say, it&rsquo;s a combination of the best</p>
<p>that public broadcasting has to offer.</p>
<p>And NFL football.</p>
<p>Beating the ideas into the turf until something breaks.</p>
<p>Common Sense with Dan Carlin.</p>
<p>I think one of the best barometers</p>
<p>of what kind of talent Bill had is to notice that</p>
<p>most people who could perform and do</p>
<p>what we just listened to Bill do,</p>
<p>would have been content to be some of the best</p>
<p>voice work actors and voiceover guys in the business.</p>
<p>And yet for Bill, this was a side gig.</p>
<p>This was a little addendum to what he really did,</p>
<p>was hold court over the greatest radio success</p>
<p>in terms of ratings that existed the whole time I was here.</p>
<p>And Bill beat my numbers easily by like double.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how good of a program he and Tim and Tracy</p>
<p>and my wife had during their heyday.</p>
<p>And Tracy and Tim, as I said, are still doing</p>
<p>the work and going strong.</p>
<p>But I mean, there&rsquo;s a giant bear-sized hole</p>
<p>in all of our lives right now.</p>
<p>And Bill was a great help in our success.</p>
<p>And like a lot of other people,</p>
<p>including his 11 children and many grandchildren,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s gonna miss him.</p>
<p>You want any repeats on anything?</p>
<p>Just one thing, buddy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like you to take it from the top</p>
<p>and run through it all again, would ya?</p>
<p>Gonna miss ya.</p>
