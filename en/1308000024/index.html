    <p>Jake, how are you going to do your Trump impression?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to do your your. OK. Yeah.</p>
<p>Everybody, I&rsquo;m getting my Twitter.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get a derangement syndrome right before we start the pod.</p>
<p>I want to warm him up.</p>
<p>Ted Cruz. This doesn&rsquo;t warm him up.</p>
<p>I get some deranged.</p>
<p>Get your show notes up, bitches.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rain Man, David Sack.</p>
<p>And instead, we open source it to the fans,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you. Queen of Kinwa.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody.</p>
<p>Welcome to another all in podcast with me today.</p>
<p>Of course, the dictator Chamath Palihapitiya,</p>
<p>the queen of Kinwa, David Friedberg.</p>
<p>And of course, yeah, definitely the rain man is here.</p>
<p>David Sacks is an excellent driver in the driveway. Yeah.</p>
<p>OK, boys, I guess we made it to episode 22.</p>
<p>Your intro becomes one second longer for every episode we do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just people love it.</p>
<p>And people, it&rsquo;s so laborious.</p>
<p>You know, they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They think it&rsquo;s so stupid.</p>
<p>I am. You have to understand persuasion.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m doing is I do the same intro and it warms.</p>
<p>OK, see, we&rsquo;re still we&rsquo;re still talking about the intro.</p>
<p>OK, let&rsquo;s just see.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s obsessed about it.</p>
<p>You prove my point.</p>
<p>All right, guys.</p>
<p>Are we going to address elephant in the room?</p>
<p>The elephant in the room, or do we just move on to topics?</p>
<p>I will say elephant in the room after the last show.</p>
<p>I fought very hard with the three of you to not post that episode.</p>
<p>You wanted to can&rsquo;t you want to spike the episode?</p>
<p>I wanted to spike the episode.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you why.</p>
<p>I thought it was not good content.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Vlad said anything new or remarkable or interesting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we had good analysis.</p>
<p>And I think the whole thing kind of felt flat and felt like a PR stunt.</p>
<p>And I felt that truly and honestly.</p>
<p>And I, you know, I made the case to you guys that we should cancel.</p>
<p>Obviously, I lost.</p>
<p>And I think going forward, we should have a veto, right?</p>
<p>But, you know, we can talk about that offline.</p>
<p>Did you quit the show or did you threaten to quit the show?</p>
<p>I threatened to quit the show now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to after this, I&rsquo;m going to propose to you my rules,</p>
<p>my ground rules for going forward, one of which I think should be</p>
<p>no more PR bullshit from Jason&rsquo;s portfolio.</p>
<p>But, you know, besides that, I think I might.</p>
<p>I think I hear a bestie guestie.</p>
<p>Is that calm, calm at the door?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that we&rsquo;re journalists.</p>
<p>By the way, I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t think that the journalism thing works for us.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re like analysts and commentators and we have opinions.</p>
<p>And so to bring someone on and try and interview them with a four on one format,</p>
<p>it just feels weird.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem to work.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t create an opportunity for discourse.</p>
<p>And frankly, you know, when you try and do journalism in this context,</p>
<p>you either appear like you&rsquo;re softballing</p>
<p>or you appear like you&rsquo;re doing gotcha journalism.</p>
<p>And I think both are bad.</p>
<p>And so I think it works really well when the four of us just kind of chat</p>
<p>and analyze and shoot the shit and have opinions and talk and debate.</p>
<p>And so my vote is to kind of avoid doing bestie guesties unless,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s something pretty amazing and critical.</p>
<p>And we can all kind of build a dialogue with that person around a topic.</p>
<p>But yeah, so that&rsquo;s kind of where I&rsquo;m sitting and how I feel about it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had a lot of debates, obviously, since since the last episode about it.</p>
<p>Can I can I build on what you&rsquo;re saying?</p>
<p>You know, this is like kind of like that really famous Teddy Roosevelt quote</p>
<p>about sort of like the man in the arena with the dust on his face, right?</p>
<p>I feel like all four of us are in the grind doing things.</p>
<p>And I think what makes the podcast good is it&rsquo;s almost like there&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you know, in a basketball game of four quarters,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a timeout and you come off the floor</p>
<p>and you can actually just take a second to observe what you&rsquo;re seeing.</p>
<p>And then the ref blows the whistle and you go back into the game.</p>
<p>And I think for me, what makes this thing so fun</p>
<p>is I feel like every Friday for these two hours,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s basically the ref calls a timeout or the coach calls a timeout.</p>
<p>And we can just kind of take a breath and just observe.</p>
<p>All right, what&rsquo;s happened before we get back in the arena?</p>
<p>And so, you know, just to your point, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re journalists</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think we should try to be because I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the point of what this is.</p>
<p>It should be four friends talking about things that are important.</p>
<p>And then to the extent that it&rsquo;s important and interesting for other people,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll listen or not listen.</p>
<p>And I think these last few weeks, we got caught up a little too much in,</p>
<p>you know, ratings, where is it ranking?</p>
<p>How can we go higher?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s that the gamification of people&rsquo;s reactions</p>
<p>that I think caused us, you know, to do that.</p>
<p>Whereas the episode before, I actually kind of liked</p>
<p>because Draymond is legitimately one of our really good friends.</p>
<p>We see him many, many times, obviously less during basketball season,</p>
<p>but a ton when he&rsquo;s outside.</p>
<p>We play poker together.</p>
<p>We all hang out together.</p>
<p>So that to me, I think is sort of inbounds.</p>
<p>Last week, and then also, you know, last week,</p>
<p>I think we were all supposed to be on point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just tell you personally for me,</p>
<p>I had an extremely crushing two weeks of work.</p>
<p>I was extremely tired.</p>
<p>I ended up literally unplugging and not doing anything for three days straight</p>
<p>and sleeping.</p>
<p>And so I didn&rsquo;t even do my best even just to be either supportive</p>
<p>or, you know, argumentative with Vlad.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think I got anything out of it myself.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Coming around the horn sacks.</p>
<p>How do you feel that episode stands on its own?</p>
<p>Obviously, it&rsquo;s very polarizing.</p>
<p>We got barbecued in the comments.</p>
<p>We got barbecued on Reddit.</p>
<p>We got barbecued on social media.</p>
<p>But then there were a large number of people who said they really liked it.</p>
<p>My mom.</p>
<p>A job.</p>
<p>David PR manager.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, there were people who liked it.</p>
<p>Sequoia thought it was excellent.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 12 people in the lunch.</p>
<p>So give us your candid assessment because you weren&rsquo;t as hard as these other two on it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wasn&rsquo;t as hard as these other two.</p>
<p>And I do feel like that if they felt that we were soft on Vlad,</p>
<p>then they should have brought it harder.</p>
<p>And they should have gone after Vlad and challenged him more.</p>
<p>That being said, I completely understand and agree with what Freeburg is saying that,</p>
<p>look, we&rsquo;re not journalists.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not playing a game of gotcha.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not our job to go after Vlad.</p>
<p>I think a lot of the comments on Twitter, that&rsquo;s what they wanted us to do.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not who we are.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s difficult for business to sex.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re attacking Vlad, and then the next day we have to go into</p>
<p>supporting founder mode, it&rsquo;s kind of a bad look, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s not what we do, right?</p>
<p>I mean, we are, like Jamal was saying, we are in the arena.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing things.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not critics sitting on the sidelines, pointing out, you know, what the doers of</p>
<p>deeds did wrong, you know?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not our job to, you know, run an inquisition on Vlad, you know?</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re not really equipped to do that.</p>
<p>I think Freeburg is right that it doesn&rsquo;t really make sense to have</p>
<p>guests on the show if the job is to, you know, to get to the bottom of something as</p>
<p>investigators, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not investigators.</p>
<p>And it was, you know, a big story, just to sort of put a cap in it, from my perspective.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m always supportive of my guys.</p>
<p>I try to be supportive of whoever I invest in, and I try to give them the benefit of</p>
<p>doubt.</p>
<p>And this is a situation where, you know, people are upset, there were mistakes that</p>
<p>were made.</p>
<p>And so I think anything other than demolishing Vlad is considered by some constituency as</p>
<p>a failure, right?</p>
<p>And so what are we supposed to do here?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t be trashing my own company that I&rsquo;m an investor in and a supporter of and founders</p>
<p>who I believe in.</p>
<p>It just wouldn&rsquo;t be authentic either.</p>
<p>Well, I think there was a moment in the pod, Jason, where I think actually, so on the whole,</p>
<p>I thought Vlad did a good job in accomplishing his objective on our pod, which was the same</p>
<p>objective he had in front of Congress, which was basically to run out the clock without</p>
<p>saying very much, you know.</p>
<p>And, you know, he actually, whoever prepped him for Congress did a pretty good job because</p>
<p>he testified for five hours and said nothing quotable, you know, which is pretty much the</p>
<p>best he can do in that situation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of the goal for him.</p>
<p>Keep your head down.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So, but there was a moment in the pod last week where I think Vlad got himself in a little</p>
<p>bit of trouble.</p>
<p>Freeberg did ask actually a pretty tough question about the guy in the street who had</p>
<p>lost all of his life savings.</p>
<p>How would Vlad respond to that?</p>
<p>He made this claim, well, I saved that person money because I shut down trading at the high.</p>
<p>And then we pointed out, no, I mean, it was a high because you shut down trading.</p>
<p>You have the causation backwards.</p>
<p>And then you ran in and said, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you know.</p>
<p>Well, my guy was on the floor.</p>
<p>I got to pick him up.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>I called a timeout.</p>
<p>I got in there.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s move on.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do we talk about the insanely high profile guest that was planned for March 5th that</p>
<p>just canceled on us?</p>
<p>No, no, no, we should.</p>
<p>We should talk.</p>
<p>Do we put it on the tape?</p>
<p>Because I, you know, the other thing about protocol, I&rsquo;ll just say Freeberg is if we</p>
<p>have a guest on, you cannot just spike the guest if they took the time to be on.</p>
<p>That was my.</p>
<p>Unless you tell them before they come on.</p>
<p>I may spike you if we don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>Yeah, do they get that right?</p>
<p>None of us do this for a profession.</p>
<p>None of us are getting paid to do that.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have any advertisers like I completely agree.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not here to be a PR machine for people.</p>
<p>I mean, Vlad had his friggin PR woman sitting on the Zoom call while we were doing it last</p>
<p>week.</p>
<p>You know, I like I just don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a little inside baseball that got interesting.</p>
<p>I think explain what happened when.</p>
<p>Well, no, we don&rsquo;t have to go there, Jason.</p>
<p>I just think I just think what Freeberg says is right.</p>
<p>Like we we do this.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t make any money from it.</p>
<p>We do it because we like to talk.</p>
<p>We I think we all learn from it.</p>
<p>I think other folks enjoy it.</p>
<p>They learn from it, but I do think that Freeberg&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to be used as a shill.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re learning as this goes.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re learning what the ground rule should be just like any other business.</p>
<p>Vlad&rsquo;s made mistakes.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to change.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve made some mistakes and we&rsquo;re iterating and I think one positive iteration that Freeberg</p>
<p>has proposed is if any one of us don&rsquo;t like an episode because we think it&rsquo;s basically</p>
<p>moving away from our values, we should be able to spike it and I support that.</p>
<p>I support it generally, but I don&rsquo;t like the idea of inviting a guest on and then it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>go well and then telling, you know, from our perspective, it makes us look bad and then</p>
<p>we tell the guest, well, you came out good and we came out down.</p>
<p>Therefore, we&rsquo;re killing you.</p>
<p>No, no, no, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>I think what Freeberg says is like, look, this is not for to be a marketing thing.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re going to ask things that are exposed that are about having a real conversation</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s real honesty.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re going to just be there and bat around, as Saks said, to run the clock out,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re just going to spike it.</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s communicated ahead.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m okay.</p>
<p>By the way, come with your A game.</p>
<p>And this is a great segue to talk about what actually we were a person that was going to</p>
<p>come on and realize that they probably were going to get so pilloried that they basically</p>
<p>spiked themselves is.</p>
<p>Yeah, they opted out.</p>
<p>Chesa Boudin, the district attorney of San Francisco.</p>
<p>Tell the guys what happened, Saks.</p>
<p>Well, no, we invited him to come on the podcast.</p>
<p>No, no, we didn&rsquo;t invite him to come.</p>
<p>He, an intermediary said that she could get him on the pod.</p>
<p>Would we like to have him on the pod?</p>
<p>We said, we discussed it.</p>
<p>We said, sure, have Chesa Boudin on and then go from there, Saks.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t like seek him out.</p>
<p>He was.</p>
<p>Well, okay, got it.</p>
<p>So he, great.</p>
<p>So he, but he agreed to be on the show.</p>
<p>And then you, our scheduler got an email out of the blue, like a day or two ago saying,</p>
<p>sorry, he&rsquo;s not coming on the show.</p>
<p>No explanation, right?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that what happened?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s basically it.</p>
<p>I mean, so look, here&rsquo;s what I would say is, Chesa, Mr. District Attorney, you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to come on the show, but I will challenge you to a debate anytime, any place, any format</p>
<p>on your policies in San Francisco.</p>
<p>So if you have the huevos to engage in a debate, I am ready.</p>
<p>And I thought Chesa was a guy who had a little bit of courage.</p>
<p>I mean, there was that night where people were discussing the situation in San Francisco</p>
<p>and on Clubhouse, and he jumped into the room.</p>
<p>So I thought this was a guy who had some cojones.</p>
<p>So Chesa, if you have the chutzpah, if you have the cojones, if you have the huevos,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s debate.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s debate.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about your policies.</p>
<p>And by the way, he&rsquo;s an expert.</p>
<p>This is what he does, you know?</p>
<p>For a living.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an expert.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t he a defense attorney, Saks?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have a.</p>
<p>He was a public defender.</p>
<p>He should mop the floor with me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just some shallow tech bro.</p>
<p>Yeah, tech bro.</p>
<p>Tech bro.</p>
<p>Who doesn&rsquo;t know anything, who he can easily demonize.</p>
<p>So I would say, come on, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do a debate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll agree to whatever format you want, but we need to talk about what&rsquo;s happening in</p>
<p>San Francisco because crime is out of control, and it&rsquo;s his fault.</p>
<p>Trigger the young Spielberg Rain Man song right about.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Drop it, boom.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the rain man with me.</p>
<p>Cackling behind.</p>
<p>Should we talk about it?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about it.</p>
<p>We should talk about what&rsquo;s happening in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Okay, so since the last pod, there has been another victim.</p>
<p>Sharia Masioka, who was a young man from originally from Kenya.</p>
<p>Who he came to the United States for college, just like Hannah Abe, who was killed on New</p>
<p>Year&rsquo;s Eve.</p>
<p>He went to Dartmouth.</p>
<p>All of his visors said he was brilliant.</p>
<p>He had a young wife and a three-year-old baby.</p>
<p>He was in San Francisco for 10 days, goes out running and gets hit, gets killed by another</p>
<p>drugged out hit and run driver who had been named.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see, I think it was Jerry Oli Adams or something like that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the guy&rsquo;s name, but he was arrested four or five times in the last</p>
<p>year and he was released every single time by Budin&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like the New Year&rsquo;s Eve story where you had this repeat offender, Troy McAllister,</p>
<p>hit, he had stolen a car, he was fleeing another crime he had committed.</p>
<p>He was on drugs and he killed Hannah Abe and Elizabeth Platt.</p>
<p>And this was another case where he was caught five times over the past year and every single</p>
<p>time he was not charged by Budin, he was just let go.</p>
<p>And so we have this case, we have a district attorney who doesn&rsquo;t want to prosecute people.</p>
<p>His agenda is decarceration.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a fire chief who doesn&rsquo;t believe in using water.</p>
<p>He is part of the burn it all down party.</p>
<p>Let me challenge you with the argument he might make, which I think I&rsquo;ve heard him make a few</p>
<p>times, which is really a position on the criminal justice system, not necessarily on local</p>
<p>prosecution, but really what he says is once someone ends up in the criminal justice system</p>
<p>in the United States, it causes this cycle of recurrence and the cycle of repeat that is very</p>
<p>difficult to get out.</p>
<p>It basically minimizes the opportunity for reform for an individual, for a criminal to</p>
<p>reform themselves and to have a shot at being a successful member of society again in the future.</p>
<p>And the objective is find other ways to kind of accelerate reform and not use incarceration</p>
<p>as the only tool in the toolbox.</p>
<p>What is, you know, what is the argument back to him when he makes that point?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve heard him make that point a number of times.</p>
<p>And how do you kind of move past that point with him?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I&rsquo;m not saying that incarceration is the only answer, but Budin&rsquo;s only answer</p>
<p>is decarceration.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t want to prosecute anyone.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t want to lock anybody up.</p>
<p>And we see the results immediately in this community.</p>
<p>You have these repeat offenders now killing people.</p>
<p>They should have been locked up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, Budin&rsquo;s always putting forth these elaborate theories.</p>
<p>This is, you know, the Central Chronicle had an article about it, about why these crimes</p>
<p>occur.</p>
<p>And he never wants to put the fault on the people who are actually perpetrating the crimes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always economic desperation.</p>
<p>He just put it forward, a theory that a decline in tourism is causing people to commit more</p>
<p>home invasions.</p>
<p>He never wants to, yes, this was in the Central Chronicle article.</p>
<p>Here, I&rsquo;ll put it up on the screen.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>I mean, the other thing you left out, David, I&rsquo;ll say is, and this was really, you know,</p>
<p>hits home to anybody with kids, is a food driver for DoorDash, not that it matters which</p>
<p>service, but was in San Francisco&rsquo;s Pacific Heights neighborhood, which is the safest</p>
<p>and most elite neighborhood in, it&rsquo;s, you know, the Beverly Hills or Bel Air of San</p>
<p>Francisco.</p>
<p>And his car was carjacked with his four-year-old daughter and two-year-old boy inside.</p>
<p>Now, of course, you should not be leaving two kids in the car.</p>
<p>Putting that aside, that mistake, which I&rsquo;m sure this father is suffering over, but he</p>
<p>needed to make deliveries, obviously.</p>
<p>He made a mistake leaving the kids in the car.</p>
<p>But we all got an Amber Alert last week on our phones.</p>
<p>I mean, this is the level of lawlessness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s turned into escape from New York level, Gotham City level chaos here.</p>
<p>And the criminals know they will not be prosecuted.</p>
<p>And this is the key criminal justice problem here.</p>
<p>If you say you are not going to prosecute crime and you demonstrate to the hardest core</p>
<p>faction of criminals that you don&rsquo;t prosecute, they&rsquo;re going to take advantage of that weakness.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Let me take the counterpoint just for a second, just so we can construct what the other side</p>
<p>of the argument looks like.</p>
<p>The other side of the argument says, okay, these folks are largely engaged in an enormous</p>
<p>amount of petty crime to support their drug habit, right?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s probably the ‚Äì and that underneath that is just an explosion of opioids and fentanyl</p>
<p>and whatnot.</p>
<p>Underneath that is sort of economic uncertainty that&rsquo;s been compounding and just basically</p>
<p>cresting over.</p>
<p>And so, folks would say, okay, these guys are a victim of a much broader economic malaise</p>
<p>that needs to get fixed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just ‚Äì you&rsquo;re shaking your head, Jason, but I&rsquo;m just saying I think that that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>the trail of breadcrumbs grows in the counter argument.</p>
<p>Well, these are the types of arguments that Chesa makes in order to obfuscate and disguise</p>
<p>that his real agenda is basically radical decarceration.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got this childhood background where his parents went to jail when he was just a baby</p>
<p>and he grew up.</p>
<p>He says his earliest memories are visiting his parents in jail and it profoundly affected</p>
<p>his political views.</p>
<p>And now we have to suffer through this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re suffering for all of them.</p>
<p>Through his childhood trauma.</p>
<p>Through his childhood trauma.</p>
<p>And so, Tramath, you&rsquo;re right about deeper causes, but it doesn&rsquo;t excuse the need to</p>
<p>lock people up when they are dangerous to the community.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just petty crime.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go through the actions he&rsquo;s taken as DA, okay?</p>
<p>So, first week on the job just about, he abolished the whole cash bail system, okay?</p>
<p>Which voters in November just voted with Prop 25 to affirm.</p>
<p>So, voters of California want the cash bail system because it keeps criminals locked up.</p>
<p>What Chesa said is that he would replace cash bail with an algorithm.</p>
<p>Well, what exactly is that algorithm?</p>
<p>He won&rsquo;t explain.</p>
<p>He won&rsquo;t submit to third-party audit.</p>
<p>There is no algorithm.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just letting people go, okay?</p>
<p>Then the next thing he did was fire seven veteran prosecutors in the DA&rsquo;s office who</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t on board with his agenda.</p>
<p>These are people who have spent their whole lives prosecuting murders, rapes, I mean,</p>
<p>hardcore crime.</p>
<p>And it takes years of experience to learn how to be a prosecutor like that.</p>
<p>So, for him to just purge this office of these veteran prosecutors is a disaster for the city.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking to people who used to work in the DA&rsquo;s office, and they tell me that</p>
<p>the problem goes much deeper than that.</p>
<p>That in addition to these seven veterans he purged, over 30 prosecutors, which is about</p>
<p>a quarter of the whole office, have left under his reign because they don&rsquo;t like working</p>
<p>for him.</p>
<p>So, and he complains about being short-staffed.</p>
<p>He says a lot that he can&rsquo;t prosecute everyone he needs to prosecute because he&rsquo;s so short-staffed.</p>
<p>The reason he&rsquo;s short-staffed is no one wants to work for him, you know?</p>
<p>By the way, I think it&rsquo;s worth highlighting, this guy was elected, right?</p>
<p>So, the city, the voters in the city.</p>
<p>In a runoff, I understand, right?</p>
<p>He won by something like 2000 votes.</p>
<p>It was a tiny, tiny number of votes.</p>
<p>Regardless, people voted him in on a platform that he very clearly articulated and is now</p>
<p>realizing in office.</p>
<p>So, there was something about that platform that I think is worth noting was and is appealing,</p>
<p>and probably is to a large number of people.</p>
<p>Large number.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>No, the part of it that&rsquo;s appealing, okay, is that we do believe that there are too many</p>
<p>people in prison and that a better way to deal with a drug addict who commits, say,</p>
<p>petty theft is to send them to treatment, okay, as opposed to putting them in prison.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So, I think we can all agree on that.</p>
<p>But his agenda is so much more radical than that.</p>
<p>He just doesn&rsquo;t want to lock people up.</p>
<p>Take Troy McAllister, okay?</p>
<p>This is a dangerous person who ‚Äì he was facing trial for his third strike, okay?</p>
<p>He committed armed robbery.</p>
<p>He robbed a store with a gun, okay?</p>
<p>He was facing a third strike for that robbery, and one of the first things Chesa did when</p>
<p>he came in was basically release him for time served.</p>
<p>He basically pleaded that down.</p>
<p>That was someone who&rsquo;s facing a life sentence.</p>
<p>That is the reason why Hannah Abe and Elizabeth Platt are dead, is because he didn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to prosecute.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a violent offender.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not disagreeing, by the way.</p>
<p>I think what is interesting to me is that so many people have an eye on and agree with</p>
<p>the notion that criminal justice system needs reform.</p>
<p>The problem is realizing that reform with a radical district attorney doesn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>resolve to a solution.</p>
<p>It resolves to more problems on a local level.</p>
<p>And even Chesa said this publicly, which is like, you can&rsquo;t just solve this problem from</p>
<p>the DA&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>It is a much bigger and broader problem, and the radical action he&rsquo;s taking isn&rsquo;t solving</p>
<p>any problems.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s creating far more.</p>
<p>I think it is worth noting, though, that there is, should, and likely will be, especially</p>
<p>with Kamala Harris as vice president, some attempts at reforming on a federal level how</p>
<p>criminals are treated, how the system realizes opportunities for them to reform and come</p>
<p>back into society as productive members.</p>
<p>But to your point, you lose all sense of safety and security if you try and do it solely</p>
<p>on a local level.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask a question.</p>
<p>Look, now we have basically political activism and judicial activism on not just the right.</p>
<p>People used to pillory Trump for putting in all these extremely conservative judges who</p>
<p>felt they were going to just sort of legislate their own point of view, Supreme Court nominees</p>
<p>who were going to try to overturn Roe v. Wade.</p>
<p>But it turns out it&rsquo;s happening on the left as well, I guess, just more at the local level.</p>
<p>How pervasive is this?</p>
<p>Like, meaning the issues of San Francisco, are these the same issues of other cities</p>
<p>and towns in America?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, you&rsquo;ve got Gascon in LA who&rsquo;s running the exact same agenda as Chesa Boudin.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not prosecuting third strikes.</p>
<p>He was just sued by an organization of deputy DA&rsquo;s, and the judge is now requiring him to</p>
<p>uphold the law, which is three strikes.</p>
<p>He will not bring third strike charges on his own.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also, this is both Gascon and Boudin now, have prohibited prosecutors from attending</p>
<p>the parole hearings of dangerous convicts, murderers, rapists, whatever, and victims</p>
<p>groups are up in arms because they need a prosecutor to go there and explain to the</p>
<p>parole board why this person does not deserve to be released.</p>
<p>And so you now have recall movements forming.</p>
<p>By the way, they&rsquo;ve also done stuff like take death penalty off the table.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve taken gang enhancements off the table.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like voluntarily, they&rsquo;re unilaterally disarming their prosecution teams.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re taking away weapons at their disposal to lock people up.</p>
<p>And this is why you&rsquo;re already seeing recalls forming around Gascon in LA.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s now a recall of Boudin forming in San Francisco.</p>
<p>David, go back to what Freeberg just said.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably not doing a bait and switch on their platform.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just like, what do you think it is about what they&rsquo;re saying that resonates</p>
<p>on the way in with the plurality of people?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing that resonates, and it&rsquo;s not that ‚Äì again, it goes back to this idea</p>
<p>that incarceration is definitely not the only answer.</p>
<p>This is where I agree.</p>
<p>The problem is Boudin is on the other side of it where decarceration is his only answer,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>We need to use multiple weapons or tools in our toolkit here.</p>
<p>So hold on.</p>
<p>So for example, okay, let&rsquo;s take the drug addict who commits a petty theft.</p>
<p>We all agree that person should go to treatment, not to jail or prison, right?</p>
<p>A nonviolent ‚Äì</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Offender, okay.</p>
<p>Reasonably.</p>
<p>But how are you going to get that person to go to treatment?</p>
<p>Because right now there is no leverage whatsoever to get that person to go to treatment because</p>
<p>Boudin&rsquo;s just not bringing charges.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not prosecuting.</p>
<p>The choice should be given to that person.</p>
<p>Listen, you can either go to jail or you can go to treatment.</p>
<p>Yeah, carrot and stick.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it going to be?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Right now we have all these social services.</p>
<p>Guess what?</p>
<p>Nobody uses them because a hardcore addict is not going to avail themselves of those services.</p>
<p>I would make the argument that we have a broader, bigger problem with the criminal justice system</p>
<p>as it operates, and it is deep, and it is complex, and it is frigging awful.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a book from a few years ago that this guy named Shane Bauer wrote.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to remember the name.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s called American Prison.</p>
<p>The guy goes undercover, and he goes and works in a penitentiary in Louisiana.</p>
<p>And he reports on what the conditions are like.</p>
<p>And these are these prisons that are run by private companies that are contracted by the</p>
<p>state locally, and what it&rsquo;s like to be an employee at one of these companies, and what</p>
<p>these employees do, and how the prisoners are treated.</p>
<p>There is no system for reform once you end up behind bars in most prisons in the United</p>
<p>States.</p>
<p>That is, you know, he makes the argument.</p>
<p>Others have made the argument.</p>
<p>That has a long history that dates all the way back to slavery in the United States.</p>
<p>In some cases, it&rsquo;s just about ineptitude.</p>
<p>In some cases, it&rsquo;s about unions, especially in California where we have a huge cost for</p>
<p>corrections and for the healthcare and the pensions for corrections officers.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of complex, competing interests in history that relates to why this criminal</p>
<p>justice system doesn&rsquo;t largely work on a moral and ethical basis, as we might all kind</p>
<p>of, you know, wear our hearts and look at like how things are working.</p>
<p>And so the problem is everyone sees this or a lot of people will see this voters will</p>
<p>see this system, treating people poorly, being inept, being corrupt, and they want to assist</p>
<p>being racist, and they want to fix it.</p>
<p>And the way they fix it is they see a guy who shows up and he&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m a sledgehammer.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to fix it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to take care of all these people.</p>
<p>And the reality is, when you try and take a shotgun and shoot it inside of a room, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to cause more problems than good.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s really what he is.</p>
<p>He is a manifestation of the anger of voters and the anger of people that look at how complex</p>
<p>and racist the system is and how difficult it is to resolve these problems.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re all looking for a simple big hammer answer.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s got the biggest mouth around.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why people vote for him.</p>
<p>All right, Chamath, and then we&rsquo;ll wrap it up.</p>
<p>Absent a few words specifically racist, if you took that out, you could use that entire</p>
<p>statement you said, and describe Trump as well.</p>
<p>Meaning the left and the right are moving to these polls, where it&rsquo;s all about authoritarian</p>
<p>sort of strongmen at the federal, state, local level, folks, to your point, David, that just</p>
<p>want to go and take a sledgehammer to things.</p>
<p>And depending on your political beliefs, or depending on the biases, or depending on your</p>
<p>life lived, you&rsquo;re going to gravitate to these two polls.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s crazy is over the next 20 or 30 years, these polarizing figures will become</p>
<p>crisper, sharper, smarter.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll find a way to foment all of the support without any of the long tail shittiness that</p>
<p>Trump figured out.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like a beta test of an idea, right?</p>
<p>He was like version 0.1.</p>
<p>Wait till we see version 1.0 of the American strongman or strongwoman.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really going to be fucking scary.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, and this is a guy who was a fan of Hugo Chavez long after he revealed himself</p>
<p>to be a strongman intent on ruling for life.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, he is very much in that mold.</p>
<p>He is a sledgehammer to the system.</p>
<p>But look, I think, and the problems are big and complicated, but look, we all have a role</p>
<p>to play.</p>
<p>The reformers have a role to play.</p>
<p>Public defenders and defense attorneys have a role to play.</p>
<p>And the district attorneys and prosecutors have a role to play.</p>
<p>And the problem we have right now and the role of the district attorney is to prosecute.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that this, by the way, Saks, is a very difficult problem to solve.</p>
<p>I think there are just so many misaligned incentives.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very clear that we don&rsquo;t try to reform people when they go to prison and that there</p>
<p>is a weird incentive when it&rsquo;s a for profit prison and the customers and the revenue is</p>
<p>based on how many people you have in the prison.</p>
<p>So if we just get rid of that, there&rsquo;s no private prisons where people have an incentive</p>
<p>to keep people in there.</p>
<p>And then if we made treatment free for everybody and had overcapacity of treatment centers,</p>
<p>and then we look at the drug schedule and say, these are the drugs that are not.</p>
<p>These are the drugs that are not harmful.</p>
<p>And these are the drugs that are really, really, really harmful.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking at a fentanyl issue like it&rsquo;s a cannabis issue and that that&rsquo;s drugs.</p>
<p>You know, cannabis versus fentanyl is like a nuclear bomb versus like a slingshot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sure there&rsquo;s no comparison between these two things.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s going to treatment when they&rsquo;re not forced.</p>
<p>Well, of course.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no treatment to go to.</p>
<p>Maybe the wait for treatment is six weeks.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>In a lot of places.</p>
<p>We have a lot of social services that aren&rsquo;t being used.</p>
<p>There are there is a lot of treatment available.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t want to do it unless they really have to.</p>
<p>Let me bring it back to where we were before.</p>
<p>Maybe the right thing is to actually have a bunch of these sledgehammer folks go off</p>
<p>for the next 10 or 20 years.</p>
<p>You know, the Trumps and the Chesapeudines, maybe they&rsquo;re all the same.</p>
<p>And maybe what we&rsquo;re all just saying is enough&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<p>This system doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just tear it down.</p>
<p>Every single brick of it, brick by brick at the local, state and federal level.</p>
<p>All I&rsquo;m saying is just I just want to get your reaction to that statement, guys.</p>
<p>Maybe maybe that&rsquo;s what people are.</p>
<p>That is what Boudin is doing is he is deconstructing the district attorney&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>from the inside.</p>
<p>He is destroying it.</p>
<p>He is not bringing charges against people.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s driving away all the veteran prosecutors.</p>
<p>But to to bring in it, he&rsquo;s bringing in all his he&rsquo;s bringing in his own people</p>
<p>who all were public defenders and have that mindset.</p>
<p>And people are dying.</p>
<p>Look, we can see the results right now in the streets.</p>
<p>Innocent people are dying.</p>
<p>Hannah Abe, Elizabeth Platt, Sharia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an emergency.</p>
<p>But to Chamath&rsquo;s point, is there any validity, Sachs or Friedberg, to the burn it all down,</p>
<p>cause chaos, and then people come in and say, you know what?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not going to.</p>
<p>This needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have a nuanced discussion.</p>
<p>Will nuance be added to this discussion, Sachs or Friedberg?</p>
<p>We need to improve things incrementally, OK?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to make things better by dismantling the whole district attorney&rsquo;s</p>
<p>office.</p>
<p>I mean, come on.</p>
<p>We need to improve things incrementally.</p>
<p>I mean, look, everything looks exponential until it cycles back.</p>
<p>So, you know, you&rsquo;re only going to have so much evolution to Gotham in San Francisco</p>
<p>until enough people put their hands in the air and say, OK, you know, time for a change.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go back and let&rsquo;s start fixing this.</p>
<p>They are.</p>
<p>They are saying that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re having that.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a recall Chesa Boone movement, flexing a muscle and making it stronger.</p>
<p>I think, you know, we&rsquo;re learning a lot about what approaches to criminal justice reform</p>
<p>work and what approaches do not work.</p>
<p>And it is clear that a local only non-prosecution position is not going to work with respect</p>
<p>to both criminal justice reform and the satisfaction of the society at large.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re realizing that.</p>
<p>And I think we are inevitably.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s so many people that are up in arms.</p>
<p>We are inevitably going to cycle back the other way at some point very soon here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And honestly, I think you guys are over intellectualizing this a little bit.</p>
<p>You know, when Sheria died because he got hit by that repeat offender, they asked his</p>
<p>wife, who&rsquo;s responsible for this?</p>
<p>She said very clearly the D.A.</p>
<p>That is who is responsible.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s stop over intellectualizing this.</p>
<p>I know the problems are big and complicated.</p>
<p>Frankly, people like chase a prey on that because they can kind of obscure what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing with, you know, some nice sounding obfuscation, some nice sounding words.</p>
<p>But the reality is he&rsquo;s not prosecuting the way he needs to.</p>
<p>We got to stop this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it is possible to have nuance and to hold multiple ideas in your head at the same time.</p>
<p>David, you could there&rsquo;s a practical reality to people cannot murder people.</p>
<p>People cannot drive in cars and run red lights on fentanyl while saying the criminal justice</p>
<p>system is incredibly biased and racist.</p>
<p>And people who are of color in Texas, you know, wind up in jail for five or 10 years</p>
<p>for selling a bag of weed.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re investing in companies that are making weed gummies or people are buying</p>
<p>stock in weed companies at the same time.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have one person who&rsquo;s a black teenager in Texas going to jail for decades for doing</p>
<p>what somebody in California or Seattle or Canada is getting an IPO for.</p>
<p>I mean, this is a fundamental injustice in the world.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something like chess or praise on.</p>
<p>But there must be nuance here where we look at each individual situation, say, what are</p>
<p>the ways to solve the problem?</p>
<p>Surgically, not with a shotgun, to David Freeburg&rsquo;s point, but with maybe a scalpel and a sniper</p>
<p>rifle.</p>
<p>Do we want to move on to questions from our audience because they submitted hundreds of</p>
<p>questions?</p>
<p>Or do we want to move on to the Australia news and Facebook backing out of publishing</p>
<p>news if that&rsquo;s a bad thing?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s end with the Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>I think, Sax, what the fuck is going on with Facebook in Australia and climate change?</p>
<p>And this is insanity.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, I think what&rsquo;s going on in Australia is contemplating a law that would require Facebook</p>
<p>and Google, and I think just those two companies, to essentially pay royalties for hyperlinks</p>
<p>to news publications.</p>
<p>And I think this is mostly at the behest of some powerful newspaper magnates down there,</p>
<p>I think, like Rupert Murdoch and folks like that.</p>
<p>I love the way you say magnates.</p>
<p>Well, they are.</p>
<p>I mean, you know.</p>
<p>But this issue is going to be very closely watched by Europe and maybe even the US.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically like a wealth transfer from Google and Facebook to the traditional media</p>
<p>and to traditional publishers.</p>
<p>This is an issue where I actually side with Zuckerberg and Facebook on this.</p>
<p>I mean, I kind of throw up a little bit in my mouth saying that.</p>
<p>But look, Tim Berners-Lee has come out and said that it could really interfere with the</p>
<p>open internet and the worldwide web if you start to tax hyperlinks.</p>
<p>I mean, historically, hyperlinks and the titles on hyperlinks were fair use.</p>
<p>You could use those things without violating somebody else&rsquo;s copyright or need to pay them</p>
<p>a royalty.</p>
<p>And so, I think that it&rsquo;s bizarre to me that Facebook and Google wouldn&rsquo;t now be able to</p>
<p>use hyperlinks.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m kind of worried about where that goes.</p>
<p>Well, Facebook said that they&rsquo;re not going to publish links now for Australian news.</p>
<p>But then they followed that up with they were also going to start</p>
<p>dismantling any anti-climate change content.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s just in Australia.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s labeling.</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s another thing going on, which is they&rsquo;ve decided now to label</p>
<p>any posts involving climate change, which is part of the whole censorship debate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s separate but related in the sense that the traditional media is cheering on censorship.</p>
<p>But then when Facebook essentially censors these links because they don&rsquo;t want to pay royalties to</p>
<p>the traditional media, then the traditional media is up in arms.</p>
<p>And so, they&rsquo;re very selective in how they view these issues.</p>
<p>My principle is very consistent, which is I want an open internet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m against censorship in all of its forms.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m worried that this new Australian law could really lead to an overall reduction or shutdown.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really, I think, going on is that with fair use, the doctrine of fair use,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a four-part test.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a lawyer.</p>
<p>Obviously, you know all the sacks.</p>
<p>But to sort of educate people in the audience who don&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s no specific</p>
<p>number of characters, no specific percentage of the original work that you can use to clear</p>
<p>yourself of fair use.</p>
<p>Fair use is a test.</p>
<p>When it goes before a judge, a judge looks at this four-part test.</p>
<p>The percentage of the work you used, is the public confused?</p>
<p>Is there some educational or criticism version of it?</p>
<p>So, if you were to use 10% of this podcast, and you were to wrap it with, put us in a picture</p>
<p>window, and you were 50% of it, and there was no confusion that you were commenting on this,</p>
<p>that would be fair use.</p>
<p>Or if you were to use it in an educational system, and if you were monetizing it.</p>
<p>Now, if you were to just clip our podcast, like this one website,</p>
<p>clipped the podcast and made 60 clips of it, took our file, and I sent them a cease and</p>
<p>desist, actually, and said, hey, don&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing it ourselves.</p>
<p>They fought us.</p>
<p>They said, we&rsquo;re fans.</p>
<p>And I said, I don&rsquo;t care if you&rsquo;re fans or not.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not linking back.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not giving us credit.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re doing 60 clips.</p>
<p>If you want to do one or two clips, and you want to comment on it, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t take all 60 clips and make a 60 clip version of this.</p>
<p>And so fairness is, in the word, fair use.</p>
<p>The problem with Zuckerberg and with how Google has used journalist content is, they are clipping</p>
<p>out specific sections of it and putting it in something called one box on Google.</p>
<p>So many of you might have said, how many people, you know, how many pounds are in, you know,</p>
<p>whatever, or what time is this TV show on?</p>
<p>And then the content that was made by the Ringer or the New York Times gets clipped,</p>
<p>and they put just that section, David, with an algorithm, and they give you the answer.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t need to go visit that website.</p>
<p>This is tipping over into what I would call unfair use, because you&rsquo;re eliminating the</p>
<p>person linking.</p>
<p>Now, let me finish.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If it was just the URL, and you didn&rsquo;t pull the headline, you didn&rsquo;t pull the abstract,</p>
<p>and you didn&rsquo;t pull a photo, that would be fine.</p>
<p>There is a very easy solution to this, which is, if you want to pull the link and the headline,</p>
<p>you pay zero dollars.</p>
<p>But if you want to pull anything else, 100 characters, etc., you need to get a license</p>
<p>from that person, unless you are doing actual criticism.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s nothing to stop anybody in Australia right now from taking a screenshot of a New</p>
<p>York Times story or an Australian, you know, newspaper story and writing some commentary</p>
<p>on it.</p>
<p>You just can&rsquo;t wholesale take everything.</p>
<p>And so what we&rsquo;re seeing here is a real-time negotiation between private parties into what</p>
<p>is fair.</p>
<p>And I think Google has a really rich history of sharing revenue.</p>
<p>The App Store, they give 70% to app developers.</p>
<p>YouTube, they give 55% to creators.</p>
<p>And with AdSense, they let you put AdSense on your website, and they give you 68 cents</p>
<p>on the dollar or something in that range.</p>
<p>They never actually disclose the exact percentage, but that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m told it is.</p>
<p>Facebook has given zero dollars to Instagram users, zero dollars to WhatsApp users, zero</p>
<p>dollars to Facebook folks.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re too greedy.</p>
<p>And what Facebook needs to do is either not use the content or come up with some reasonable</p>
<p>payment and come to an agreement with these folks who are now banding together.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re realizing the traffic we get from Facebook and Google is not worth what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking away from us, which is all that revenue that, you know, they earned in the free market.</p>
<p>And so this is a free market debate.</p>
<p>And I think the government should stay out of it to a certain extent and let the free</p>
<p>market work, which is all publishers should get together in the United States and confront</p>
<p>Facebook and say, pay us unless you use anything more than the headline.</p>
<p>But Jason, I think these things are interconnected, though, right?</p>
<p>On the one hand, if you have an economic stake in distribution of content, but then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>also then going to decide under, you know, an opaque definition, what is truth or not</p>
<p>truth, you all of a sudden just become, I mean, the purest form definition of a publisher.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And I think it just becomes a very treacherous place for both Facebook and Google to end up in.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost better ‚Äì</p>
<p>Well, Google is paying the bill, by the way.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Google is paying for it.</p>
<p>Facebook has decided not to.</p>
<p>But Facebook, they said something like only 4% of their posts involve this kind of content.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just not a big deal for them the way it is for Google.</p>
<p>Well, I think it is a big deal for Facebook.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just trying to make a point here because Zuckerberg&rsquo;s ‚Äì</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re being overly heavy-handed in their response.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question about it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re throwing their weight around.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t look good.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not defending Facebook.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m defending the principle.</p>
<p>I mean, look, if this Australian principle were used, you wouldn&rsquo;t have the Drudge Report.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t be able to create a site of news links.</p>
<p>No, you could if it was commentary.</p>
<p>You could put the link and write commentary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when you just rip the links.</p>
<p>People are objecting to ripping the links without any commentary.</p>
<p>Drudge Report rewrites the headline, puts his own spin on it, and then links.</p>
<p>He would never get caught into this, and there is no publication that would ever object.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;re objecting to is taking the photo, taking the first paragraph,</p>
<p>and the synopsis is 30% or 40% of the value.</p>
<p>And so Facebook is a better ‚Äì and Twitter with their algorithms ‚Äì are better</p>
<p>front pages than the New York Times front page.</p>
<p>Well, why isn&rsquo;t this applying to Twitter then?</p>
<p>I think it will ultimately.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll go there as well.</p>
<p>I think this will become the test case, which is if you want to take</p>
<p>more than just the headline, and basically that&rsquo;s it, or the URL,</p>
<p>if you want to have that little snippet, pay us.</p>
<p>Pay us something.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be a lot.</p>
<p>But this could actually solve ‚Äì if these networks that are making tens to hundreds</p>
<p>of millions of billions of dollars, if they just said, you know what,</p>
<p>1% to the news organizations to keep them viable,</p>
<p>just like anybody else would pay a licensing fee for terrestrial radio or other things.</p>
<p>Why is the Australian government setting the price?</p>
<p>And why are they only applying this to Google and Facebook?</p>
<p>Well, I think they&rsquo;re going to go right down the line.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just a starting point.</p>
<p>But to my point, I said earlier, is I don&rsquo;t think the government needs to do this.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I think the news organizations en masse should get together and put their foot down and say no.</p>
<p>And if they did, they would get paid.</p>
<p>It sounds like what the government should do is clarify what fair use entails.</p>
<p>Yeah, just the link.</p>
<p>And then maybe it&rsquo;s a link plus a title.</p>
<p>I mean, look, it&rsquo;s never just a link, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hyperlink plus the snippet.</p>
<p>Plus the word.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Yes, the snippet is the issue.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>So the government should clarify what fair use is.</p>
<p>And then if Google and Facebook or whoever want more, they got to go negotiate for it.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But Australia is doing more than that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re setting the price.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re limiting their overreaching policy just to Google and Facebook,</p>
<p>because they know that if they applied it to everybody.</p>
<p>By the way, we do that.</p>
<p>We already do this in the United States, David,</p>
<p>with local carriage of news organizations on terrestrial TV.</p>
<p>So we already mix it up with the FTC doing this with licenses and the public good.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the extent.</p>
<p>I think the other thing that is going to happen with all of this is like on the other side of</p>
<p>this, the actual media organizations themselves that theoretically could benefit from this</p>
<p>are frankly just going out of business.</p>
<p>Anyways, there&rsquo;s a Wall Street Journal alert for the owner of the LA Times,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s about to sell the Times.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s very likely that the Times in four or five years doesn&rsquo;t even exist.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t really know where all of this goes, except that everybody&rsquo;s just going to be an</p>
<p>individual person blogging and tweeting whatever opinion they want, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;d be no money to pay anybody because it won&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>But what will be left is then these rules on arbitration of fact and fiction.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re going to end up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be a crazy place.</p>
<p>Because then those folks, those folks then really are the puppet masters.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree that these traditional publications have like a fundamental business model problem.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not going to be solved.</p>
<p>Like I think there&rsquo;s like a misplaced blame on Facebook and Google.</p>
<p>I mean, the fundamental problem with all these publications are you go search for</p>
<p>a news article on something and there&rsquo;s like 10 versions of the same thing or more, 100 versions.</p>
<p>And you know, when newspapers, we used to have thousands of newspapers all across the country,</p>
<p>and they had a local geographic monopoly.</p>
<p>But once it all got digitized and moved online, you realize how much redundancy there was.</p>
<p>You have thousands of reporters creating the exact same thing.</p>
<p>And there needs to be consolidation.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to have 100 articles.</p>
<p>Not only that, but a point we made last time, which is, you know,</p>
<p>facts have largely commoditized or most facts.</p>
<p>Like, you know, remember we used to open the newspaper and look at what the stock market</p>
<p>prices were.</p>
<p>We opened the newspaper and looked at the sports scores.</p>
<p>We looked at what happened in this place and this place.</p>
<p>Facts about events, facts about the prices of things, facts about sports scores.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all completely commoditized.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s like 90% of the content of what people used to read the newspaper for</p>
<p>has gone online.</p>
<p>And so, as we talked about last time, newspapers and publications of the like have largely moved</p>
<p>into, you know, different sorts of narrative.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s created a marketplace that has a lot more competition because anyone can</p>
<p>write that, as we&rsquo;re seeing with Substack and Medium.</p>
<p>And as we&rsquo;re seeing with our own podcast.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing with our own podcast.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s, this feels to me like, you know, I went to a media conference back</p>
<p>in 2008, and there was this huge battle between Google and Viacom.</p>
<p>And I was at the conference and I think Larry Page was on stage or someone or Eric Schmidt</p>
<p>was on stage and the Viacom CEO got up and he&rsquo;s like, when are you going to start paying</p>
<p>us for our content?</p>
<p>And I think that that, and he really screamed at him in a room of like 800 people.</p>
<p>And I feel like that same kind of point of view has persisted until there&rsquo;s finally some</p>
<p>legislation that they feel kind of gets them justice.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the world has passed them by.</p>
<p>And, you know, I think this, this will be kind of some transitory legislation that ultimately</p>
<p>the content is going to democratize anyway, and the content creation is going to democratize.</p>
<p>Last topic for me, because I really want Friedberg&rsquo;s answer to this, because I also</p>
<p>just saw an alert, how the federal government is opening up a vaccination site in Miami</p>
<p>Dade County actually saw Francis Suarez retweeted.</p>
<p>What the hell&rsquo;s going on with vaccinations?</p>
<p>Are we going to get vaccinated soon?</p>
<p>I said it in December, and I tweeted about it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve repeated it multiple times since that the US has enough supply to vaccinate</p>
<p>pretty much anyone that wants to get vaccinated, because we are producing and delivering three</p>
<p>to 4 million doses per day in the US right now.</p>
<p>And there is a just a fundamental issue, especially like, I mean, look at California, you know,</p>
<p>they haven&rsquo;t opened up, quote, unquote, vaccination to people outside of tier or what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>called Tier 1A.</p>
<p>And so this is much more of a kind of policy issue than an administrative issue than a</p>
<p>supply and demand issue.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s enough people that want the vaccine, and there&rsquo;s enough vaccine to just let people</p>
<p>get fucking vaccinated.</p>
<p>And so I feel like the market forces are now kind of converging with policy a little bit</p>
<p>more than they were a month ago.</p>
<p>And the policymakers are no longer fighting and complaining about supply and complaining</p>
<p>about constraints.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;ve got mass vac sites now in California.</p>
<p>The amount of money that&rsquo;s being wasted, by the way, in this process makes me want to</p>
<p>vomit every time I read about it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a whole nother separate issue.</p>
<p>But it feels to me like we&rsquo;re probably May, June, when enough people are vaccinated that</p>
<p>we can have, you know, a circumstance where people are going to fly without masks and</p>
<p>be comfortable doing so.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m sure there will be these over, you know, constraining rules around what people</p>
<p>can and can&rsquo;t do in public for a very long time.</p>
<p>Like I mentioned, what happened?</p>
<p>I do want to say one thing that I&rsquo;ve noticed, we were we were all we played some poker the</p>
<p>other night, we were with a friend who got vaccinated.</p>
<p>And I was like, he said, This is my first time playing poker with people.</p>
<p>And I was like, Well, you got vaccinated?</p>
<p>Like, why aren&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, Well, I don&rsquo;t know if other strains are going to get me or, you know, if this</p>
<p>thing&rsquo;s evolving, and other people are going to get sick.</p>
<p>And if you think about what&rsquo;s happened over the last year, people have been conditioned</p>
<p>to be afraid.</p>
<p>And so even though we&rsquo;re getting vaccinated, even though this thing is moving and working,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m concerned that we&rsquo;re not going to end up in a more civil state.</p>
<p>Schools aren&rsquo;t opening.</p>
<p>People aren&rsquo;t flying, people aren&rsquo;t doing stuff, even after vaccinations and science</p>
<p>and data shows that these things are okay.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s some cases of it.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m saying is, like, you know, the human subconscious gets trained first.</p>
<p>And then our conscious mind rationalizes what we feel.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all now been trained over the past year to be very afraid.</p>
<p>And then we all come up with these rational excuses about why I can&rsquo;t do x, y, and z.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, but you&rsquo;ve been fucking vaccinated.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re fine.</p>
<p>Like, all the data, all the science says, go do whatever you want to do.</p>
<p>Go into a nightclub, sweaty, next to people, robbing beats.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And tell us about the throbbing nightclub.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like that scene from so animated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that scene from Good Will Hunting.</p>
<p>Remember when he talks to the psychologist, like, tell us about your rave stories again.</p>
<p>Activating these emotions.</p>
<p>Throbbing, rave, give up to the mob, pulsating bodies.</p>
<p>And did the molly just kick in Friedberg?</p>
<p>Did you drop a molly at the start of the pod?</p>
<p>But my point is, like, people are really afraid.</p>
<p>And I think I just got the best idea for an episode.</p>
<p>The biggest concern I have is, frankly, less about are we going to get vaccinated?</p>
<p>I feel like the convergence between market forces and government nonsense</p>
<p>is now going to allow us to all get vaccinated.</p>
<p>But the issue is really going to be like, how do you break through these rules and the fear</p>
<p>that basically I want, but I don&rsquo;t understand where are the max vaccination sites in California</p>
<p>and who&rsquo;s eligible?</p>
<p>Like, why aren&rsquo;t we just making this thing like a drive through?</p>
<p>We should.</p>
<p>This is where we can absolutely right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>We all have absolute violent agreement that California is so messed up with respect to</p>
<p>how we&rsquo;re vaccinating.</p>
<p>We have so much supply.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re sitting on half our friggin supply right now in California.</p>
<p>30 million vaccines sitting on shelves.</p>
<p>We are now at 75 percent deployed.</p>
<p>80 percent.</p>
<p>California&rsquo;s got like four or five million vaccines sitting in storage.</p>
<p>It should be a drive through.</p>
<p>And you just get in line and you go.</p>
<p>And some places we&rsquo;re doing is, you know, but what we&rsquo;re doing now is you got to schedule.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, scheduling is bullshit.</p>
<p>Because first you got to qualify, then you got to schedule an appointment.</p>
<p>And then the clinic or whatever is only open from nine to five.</p>
<p>And so like how many doses they really administering when you got to make an appointment?</p>
<p>Probably one every half hour.</p>
<p>So maybe they get through 16 people a day or something like that.</p>
<p>Improved qualifications.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And they get fined a million dollars and lose their medical license if they inject the wrong</p>
<p>person.</p>
<p>So, I mean, you&rsquo;re talking about 16 people per day at a site when they could be doing</p>
<p>a couple of hundred.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Well, Johnson and Johnson is coming and that&rsquo;s refrigerator stable, right?</p>
<p>Freeburg.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even need it.</p>
<p>We now have bought 1.2 billion vaccines.</p>
<p>But let me go back to Freeburg&rsquo;s point about when will life get back to normal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not as pessimistic as you are, Dave, about this idea that life won&rsquo;t go back to normal.</p>
<p>And part of the reason why is I&rsquo;m seeing so much outrage about school closures right now.</p>
<p>California is one of the only states in the country that&rsquo;s still completely closed all</p>
<p>the schools and people are absolutely up in arms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s as big an issue as this exploding crime issue.</p>
<p>Crime is a big issue in the cities and school closures is the big issue in the suburbs.</p>
<p>And if these two things don&rsquo;t turn around, I think Gavin Newsom is going to get recalled.</p>
<p>I mean, people are just on fire about this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I mean, my point was like our wealthy, conservative, you know, friend that lives</p>
<p>in Florida was afraid to go do stuff even after he&rsquo;s been vaccinated.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s permeated everywhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like there&rsquo;s a shark.</p>
<p>Freeburg, it&rsquo;s like a shark attack.</p>
<p>You know, if this is shark attack, you know, at Half Moon Bay or whatever, people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>swim there for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>And then somebody swims and they&rsquo;re like, oh, the water is great.</p>
<p>People will jump back in.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s April, David, to your point of when this goes back to normal.</p>
<p>Because if you look now, people have been saying, Freeburg, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>Would you put a 5x multiplier on the confirmed COVID cases, a 4x multiplier?</p>
<p>Yeah, 5x I think is the right median.</p>
<p>So if you have 30 million people who&rsquo;ve had the vaccine, had COVID, you&rsquo;re looking at</p>
<p>five times that is 150.</p>
<p>Now you have 60 million people who have been vaccinated.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re at 210.</p>
<p>There were 330 million Americans, 70 million are under our kids.</p>
<p>So, you know, we&rsquo;re basically getting to herd immunity.</p>
<p>And if you look at the slopes right now, what is causing the drop in cases this massively,</p>
<p>David?</p>
<p>Is it herd immunity, vaccine, or people suddenly wearing masks?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s complexity because everyone assumes that there&rsquo;s one thing that affects the whole</p>
<p>population.</p>
<p>But remember, the way viruses work is they&rsquo;re hyperlocal.</p>
<p>And so the local population dynamics looked at on a scale is where you see the statistical</p>
<p>results of the scale.</p>
<p>And so, you know, we saw this in North Dakota, a bunch of people got really sick, they got</p>
<p>to herd immunity in communities, and then all of a sudden, it dropped off the curve.</p>
<p>When you zoom out, and that&rsquo;s happening, combined with behavioral changes combined with vaccines,</p>
<p>then you start to see these statistical things happen at scale.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a simple answer.</p>
<p>But the answer generally can be, we are coming down the slope, we are getting to a point</p>
<p>of, you know, general, like, low case counts, low death counts, low fatality, and we should</p>
<p>be living a normal life, allowing our economy to kind of progress again.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re still caught up in this kind of fear, fear, fear.</p>
<p>Pick a date.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just do this end on this pick a date when you think all four besties are vaccinated.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna say April 1, June, June, okay, what do you got free break?</p>
<p>I say April 1, we&rsquo;re all going to be vaccinated, literally a choice.</p>
<p>I mean, any one of us could go get vaccinated in the next month.</p>
<p>I mean, how?</p>
<p>None of us are over 30 BMI.</p>
<p>I mean, sacks was for a minute.</p>
<p>California is opening one be a lot of the other states are opening broadly.</p>
<p>If any of you wanted to get on a plane and go get vaccinated somewhere else, you could.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s enough places now that have open VACs, or will in the next 30 days, you can go</p>
<p>get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Okay, so you say 30 days, which would be March 15?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a choice for the four of us.</p>
<p>If you guys want to hop on a plane, we can go get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Does anybody have access to it?</p>
<p>But sorry, but doesn&rsquo;t that you&rsquo;re saying in an open VAC state,</p>
<p>anybody can show up without proof of driver&rsquo;s license.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve looked into this.</p>
<p>There have been different ways that this has played out.</p>
<p>But generally speaking, there are market forces at play where you know, where there&rsquo;s a will,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a way not saying that you&rsquo;re cutting line and screwing people over.</p>
<p>But there are vaccinations that are happening all over the country now,</p>
<p>with people that want to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>And by the way, in California next week, tier one B opens up.</p>
<p>So anyone does that mean?</p>
<p>What does tier one be?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a total bs definition.</p>
<p>It is absolutely ridiculous.</p>
<p>I absolutely think this is the biggest waste of time and money ever.</p>
<p>But tier one B definition in California is healthcare workers, sorry,</p>
<p>childcare workers.</p>
<p>So anyone that&rsquo;s a teacher or works with children, kids,</p>
<p>if your nanny or your daycare people, you know, wanted to, they could go in and get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Oh, wait, our nanny can get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Starting next Wednesday in California.</p>
<p>And so all you need to do is go get to a vac site with vaccines.</p>
<p>And by the way, they all a lot of them have vaccination supply now,</p>
<p>or they will this weekend.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s apparently big shipment going out.</p>
<p>And also all food and agriculture workers loosely defined.</p>
<p>So people that work in grocery stores, restaurants, farm workers,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying anyone, anyone, if you have a chef, they can get back to no, no,</p>
<p>I think two people out of four on here might have chefs.</p>
<p>I think two of us definitely don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So if you take care of your own kids and cook your own food, you can&rsquo;t get vaccinated.</p>
<p>But if you do that for somebody else, you can.</p>
<p>So wait, you&rsquo;re saying if you have a chef and you have nannies, you get vaccinated?</p>
<p>No, you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying is, is you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a chef or a nanny for someone else, you can go get vaccinated next week.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But David, what do you want for dinner?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m coming over right now to make whatever you want.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll watch your kids this weekend, Dave.</p>
<p>Get me a shot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so insane.</p>
<p>We have all these ridiculous job categories and distinctions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like with the lockdown policy.</p>
<p>They had 10 pages of exceptions for essential workers.</p>
<p>Listen, if you&rsquo;ve got a policy with 10 pages of exceptions,</p>
<p>the policy doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>Like all the and this caused all the controversy in LA.</p>
<p>Like anyone that works in the movie business is an essential worker.</p>
<p>But people that work in restaurants and bars are not.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see this for what it is.</p>
<p>It is payoff to do some political supporters.</p>
<p>The politicians are using they use essential worker exceptions.</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;re using vaccines as political capital.</p>
<p>They dole them out to their supporters so that in exchange for votes down the road.</p>
<p>Remember the exception, David, if you serve more than seven courses in your prefix,</p>
<p>you can get a vaccine.</p>
<p>So that is the French laundry.</p>
<p>If you add an amuse-bouze and an intermezzo, you qualify for the vaccine.</p>
<p>There are people going to states, renting houses and getting driver&rsquo;s licenses.</p>
<p>Vaccine tourism.</p>
<p>And getting vaccines.</p>
<p>I know about this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called vaccine tourism.</p>
<p>By the way, think about it this way.</p>
<p>In six weeks, I think a lot of those restrictions are going to fall by the wayside</p>
<p>because the supply is going to completely outstrip the nonsensical</p>
<p>restrictions and prioritization methods we put in place.</p>
<p>And hopefully, God willing, these idiots who have the ability to vaccinate people</p>
<p>open up their sites 24-7 and drop all the bullshit questionnaires and registration requirements,</p>
<p>let people drive in, get a shot, wait 15 minutes and leave,</p>
<p>and have just some basic principled people on site that can take care of people if they have</p>
<p>an adverse allergic reaction and get shots in arms.</p>
<p>We have the shots.</p>
<p>We have the supply.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to be oversupplied by May.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to have far more shots than there will be demand.</p>
<p>And so, you know, we just need to get this kind of nonsense thrown out the window.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Straight to Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>This is from Videsh.</p>
<p>He says, where are you investing your money over the next 10 years?</p>
<p>So, Friedberg, you want to start and then we&rsquo;ll go to Saks and then Mr. Polihopatia.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about this pretty largely, you know, on the podcast.</p>
<p>Two areas that are super interesting to me that I&rsquo;m spending a lot of time on is obviously</p>
<p>biomanufacturing.</p>
<p>So, the idea that we can kind of move away from traditional animal-based agriculture</p>
<p>and systems of production to systems where we use genetically engineered microbial organisms</p>
<p>to produce molecules and materials and food and that system of production can have a radical</p>
<p>impact on the environment, on the opportunity for jobs, on the cost of goods and things</p>
<p>that humans want and consume.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a primary area of interest for me.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s a multi-decade.</p>
<p>I think by 2050, you know, we should see most of our goods that are manufactured rather</p>
<p>than being made in the traditional sense, which is basically old technology scaled up,</p>
<p>which is what the Industrial Revolution did, but really shift to a new model of manufacturing</p>
<p>where we use a smarter machine, which is a biological organism to make stuff.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s my interest.</p>
<p>Saks.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m focused on the area of bottom-up SaaS, which is basically business software that</p>
<p>can go viral very much in the mold of Yammer, which was a company I founded and sold back</p>
<p>a dozen years ago.</p>
<p>It was the precursor to Slack, let&rsquo;s be honest.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It could have been $27 billion, but you did not ride your winner.</p>
<p>You took the quick billy.</p>
<p>And that was not a mistake because it lets you invest in the other 20 unicorns, correct?</p>
<p>Kind of.</p>
<p>I mean, so.</p>
<p>So, oh, you do have a chip on your shoulder about selling too early.</p>
<p>No, no, it&rsquo;s not a chip.</p>
<p>I would say that around the time that PayPal hit a $200 billion market cap and Slack had</p>
<p>a $27 billion outcome, I started realizing, you know, if I just stuck with my ideas longer,</p>
<p>you know, I probably would do better.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, you know, I don&rsquo;t really need to come up with a new thesis or a new idea.</p>
<p>I already came up with the idea 12 years ago, which is to make business software viral.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to keep investing in that thesis.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s not that original or new for me, but it is, you know, bottom up has become</p>
<p>the, I would say almost the dominant mode now of SaaS.</p>
<p>Explain that to somebody who doesn&rsquo;t understand what you mean, bottom up.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, bottom up means that the entry point for the software is any employee in the company.</p>
<p>They can just start using it.</p>
<p>They go to your website.</p>
<p>They start using it.</p>
<p>They spread it to their coworkers, as opposed to top down.</p>
<p>Top down is like the Oracle sales guy who carries a bag and goes to meet with the CIO</p>
<p>and, you know, sells them a big expensive implementation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the, and that&rsquo;s traditionally what business software used to be,</p>
<p>is a big top down IT sale.</p>
<p>Bottom up is, is just going in through the rank and file employees.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Chamath Palihapitiya, for the next 10 years, where are you putting your money?</p>
<p>Two areas.</p>
<p>Inequality, well, it&rsquo;s not even 10.</p>
<p>I would say for the next, for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s, I think these arcs are multi-decade, but inequality and climate change.</p>
<p>And so, you know, the inequality side, what does that mean?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s any business ‚Äì</p>
<p>By the way, the second you said inequality and climate change, Sachs left.</p>
<p>He went to throw up.</p>
<p>He was just like, what is this nonsense?</p>
<p>He just ran.</p>
<p>He went to throw up.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, oh God, here we go.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s back now.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>Sachs, did you throw up when Chamath said inequality and climate change out of your bag?</p>
<p>When he said his woke nonsense, did you just go throw up?</p>
<p>No, I, I, I&rsquo;m upset.</p>
<p>He burnt your signal and you threw up.</p>
<p>He had to polish his glock.</p>
<p>He just called a security detail.</p>
<p>He went and he kissed his gold bricks that he keeps in his house.</p>
<p>No, inequality basically means anything that evens the starting line.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s healthcare software that solves a chronic condition or if that&rsquo;s financial</p>
<p>software that drives inclusion, and then climate change is pretty obvious, but the</p>
<p>panoply of things that we need to do to basically, you know, slow the warming of the earth,</p>
<p>those are the two areas.</p>
<p>Huge opportunity.</p>
<p>For Videsh, if you even care, I take a Remora-like approach.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what a Remora is, you ever see like a big shark and then there&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>bunch of things stuck to it and it&rsquo;s like following the shark and it just eats whatever.</p>
<p>So basically what I do is I&rsquo;m getting behind these three guys and I just draft on these</p>
<p>three sharks and just try to weasel my way onto their cap tables.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a living, you know, basically I just go to the poker game and try to.</p>
<p>No, in all sincerity, I am state, I am vertical agnostic because I think the great companies</p>
<p>make the verticals.</p>
<p>They create the categories and the categories don&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>At your stage, particularly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>At your stage, particularly, yeah.</p>
<p>And so what I do in the early stages, I am focused on the process and the process I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to master here is what I do at thesyndicate.com, which is find great companies and</p>
<p>share it with now 7,000 accredited investors and let them decide, you know, how much they</p>
<p>want to invest in each deal.</p>
<p>And just to give people an idea, we are on a $60 million run rate this year of deploy</p>
<p>capital via the syndicate.</p>
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;ll be four times, five times what my fund will do.</p>
<p>The fund has access to 100% of deals, but the syndicate has access to 60% roughly.</p>
<p>So now that we&rsquo;ve broken our no advertising rule.</p>
<p>No, I mean, we&rsquo;re all talking our book here.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take another question.</p>
<p>And Angel is available from HarperCollins business.</p>
<p>Oh, here&rsquo;s a good one.</p>
<p>By the way, if you want to save money on car insurance, metromile.com.</p>
<p>Sorry, go ahead.</p>
<p>Absolutely fantastic.</p>
<p>Also the ticker symbol.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the biggest investment venture miss?</p>
<p>You had early starting out.</p>
<p>That would have been a ridiculous return.</p>
<p>What is our anti portfolio looking like?</p>
<p>Friedberg?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll start with you.</p>
<p>Then go Chabot.</p>
<p>Then go sacks.</p>
<p>Free.</p>
<p>I was with, um, Jack Dorsey and, um, and, uh, at this conference and he went around and</p>
<p>did a pass the hat on who wanted to invest in his new startup called square.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my story.</p>
<p>What, what is that?</p>
<p>A 50, is that a $50 million miss?</p>
<p>Um, yeah, I&rsquo;m not going to say it, it would have been 50 K in at 10 million, but I mean,</p>
<p>the problem here&rsquo;s, by the way, an interesting thing, going back to the point Saks made earlier</p>
<p>and that we&rsquo;ve said in the past, you know, when square went public, there was a lot of</p>
<p>questions and trepidation around its valuation.</p>
<p>Big fund managers were poopooing the company.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the market cap of square today?</p>
<p>Saks, you might know.</p>
<p>100, 120, 120 billion.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I mean, 125 billion today.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Because like when they went public, people were kind of poopooing it saying this thing</p>
<p>is a, this is a sub billion dollar company, you know, it shouldn&rsquo;t be worth anything more</p>
<p>than a billion dollars and look at it just a few years later.</p>
<p>Um, anyway, yeah, I missed it.</p>
<p>I missed that one on the seed round.</p>
<p>And, um, and I&rsquo;ve just watched with, with awe at what Jack has continued to innovate.</p>
<p>As a public company, it troughed at a $4 billion valuation.</p>
<p>It did, right?</p>
<p>It did like five years ago.</p>
<p>And so within five years, it&rsquo;s gone from 4 billion to 124 billion.</p>
<p>I was in a venture capital fund that invested in it.</p>
<p>They distributed the shares.</p>
<p>I sold half and I was like, I&rsquo;ll just keep half.</p>
<p>I like Jack.</p>
<p>I sold half at 72.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s at 276.</p>
<p>And so ride your winners, folks.</p>
<p>Saks, anti-portfolio, which one is the most painful?</p>
<p>Honestly, I haven&rsquo;t missed that much to speak.</p>
<p>Okay, there you go.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>
<p>What a douche.</p>
<p>What a douche.</p>
<p>What a fucking douche.</p>
<p>Well, actually, um, I, I analyzed my chess game with Peter Thiel.</p>
<p>And actually my check, my castle, uh,</p>
<p>Queen&rsquo;s eye castle was actually a brilliant move.</p>
<p>If he hadn&rsquo;t pinned my, no, I mean, look, I, uh, I, I, I tend, I, I look,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t overthink these things too much.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m in like 27 unicorns.</p>
<p>If the company looks good, I, I invest.</p>
<p>Is this Phil?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Phil Helmuth here.</p>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>
<p>Phil Helmuth.</p>
<p>Well, you know, I got my 16th ring, but I&rsquo;ve won 29 of the last 30 sessions.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>What would you say your total like multiple is on all your angel investing?</p>
<p>Like, do you have a sense of what that number is?</p>
<p>Saks, answer the question.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>The audience asked what you missed.</p>
<p>Can you just be humble enough to say you missed something?</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you.</p>
<p>So this was a semi, sort of a semi-miss is that, um, is that-</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even a miss.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a semi-miss.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Back in-</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s how I made up for it.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>I only put in half my normal amount.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Let me tell you what happened.</p>
<p>I did miss it.</p>
<p>So, uh, back in 2007, um, I thought Twitter was going to take off.</p>
<p>I had a, like a former employee who wanted to sell secondary.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I had a deal worked out to buy, I think a couple hundred thousand</p>
<p>dollars of shares at, I don&rsquo;t know, a $40 million valuation or something like that.</p>
<p>And, um, we submitted it to the company and then they rophered it for, cause I think Chris</p>
<p>Saka, for Chris Saka, basically, I don&rsquo;t know if you remember Saka had set up like some</p>
<p>secondary-</p>
<p>Secondary thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, yeah, the fact that, you know, I wasn&rsquo;t able to complete that transaction probably</p>
<p>cost me, you know, a couple hundred million bucks.</p>
<p>Chamath, anti-portfolio, what sticks out?</p>
<p>Well, I have a, I have a huge anti-portfolio.</p>
<p>Huge.</p>
<p>Robinhood.</p>
<p>You know, Airbnb at a billion, obviously.</p>
<p>I actually did invest.</p>
<p>I agreed to invest, but then I got into a huge public snafu with, with Chesky, cause</p>
<p>he was taking a bunch of money off the table.</p>
<p>And then we ended up not even finalizing the investment.</p>
<p>And your letter was, your letter was published.</p>
<p>My email was leaked.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It was leaked.</p>
<p>So I was really pissed when they did that.</p>
<p>But anyways, that was a decade ago.</p>
<p>Not much has changed, I guess.</p>
<p>There is one thing that above all others, which is sadly also in my portfolio.</p>
<p>So my portfolio, my anti-portfolio is the same thing.</p>
<p>You can guess what it is, but that&rsquo;s Bitcoin.</p>
<p>At one point, you know, we controlled low single digits, mid single digits of the entire</p>
<p>float.</p>
<p>And had I held on to that, that&rsquo;s talking about, you know, a mid deca billion dollar</p>
<p>position.</p>
<p>So my anti-portfolio in, in the unrealized loss and unrealized gains or losses, if you</p>
<p>will, on Bitcoin is in the many tens of billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Mine is clearly Bitcoin as well, because I was reporting on it when it was 10 cents.</p>
<p>And I was one of the first journalists to write about it and talk about it on my podcast.</p>
<p>And I had like maybe 10 of these Bitcoins in a wallet of, that was Mount Gox and it</p>
<p>got hacked and it all went away.</p>
<p>And then my wife bought it at under 200.</p>
<p>And so now we have a joke in the house that my wife is going to, because of her incredible</p>
<p>trade, because she, she saw it as well, return more on her.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s conceivable she&rsquo;ll return more than my entire investing career.</p>
<p>So shout out to Jade for getting that one.</p>
<p>Um, actually, I made that mistake too, that Chamath made of, of not hodling enough, long</p>
<p>enough.</p>
<p>So that, that is, did you guys see, did you see this article?</p>
<p>I fished this article out, but in 2014, I was buying, uh, uh, landed Martus camp in</p>
<p>Lake Tahoe.</p>
<p>And I told the sales guy there, Jeff Hall, I said, Hey, listen, I&rsquo;ll buy this lot.</p>
<p>If you let me buy it in Bitcoin, because I wanted to promote Bitcoin, Bitcoin as a</p>
<p>transactional infrastructure.</p>
<p>So we went to a company called Bitpay.</p>
<p>They wired it up and I bought it for $1.6 million in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>That was 2,800 coins, which right now is worth 140 or $150 million.</p>
<p>What are you going to build on that lot?</p>
<p>Are you going to put your, I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t even own that lot.</p>
<p>You should make it a grave.</p>
<p>You should make it a grave plot.</p>
<p>You should just, well, my, my ex-wife owns a lot.</p>
<p>I hope I have, you know, she enjoys it, but I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>You literally could have bought the Knicks Lakers and the Warriors and been the majority</p>
<p>owner in each.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take another question.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the number one macro uncertainty or risk you guys are most worried about for your</p>
<p>investment portfolios?</p>
<p>There is only one, and I think it&rsquo;s inflation, but I think it&rsquo;s important to understand where</p>
<p>inflation is coming from.</p>
<p>The single biggest risk to all of us is what&rsquo;s going to happen in the following order of</p>
<p>operations.</p>
<p>So I think all of this sort of at the coming out of the pandemic, basically what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have is like four or five major trading blocks in the world, right?</p>
<p>You have China as a standalone, you have Europe as a standalone, you have America slash North</p>
<p>America under Biden.</p>
<p>I think it could be more North America as a, as a standalone.</p>
<p>And then you have these sort of what I would call random, you know, friends with benefits,</p>
<p>Africa, South America, Japan, Korea.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But those are all bit players to these three huge trading blocks.</p>
<p>Everybody was going to go and they&rsquo;re going to go and get vertically integrated.</p>
<p>So it sort of builds a little bit on what David said.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re not going to have, you know, one central place where you get this thing,</p>
<p>basically, i.e.</p>
<p>China that you ship on a boat to get over here for a whole host of reasons, national</p>
<p>security, carbon, et cetera.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to have all these vertically, you know, vertically integrated supply chains</p>
<p>and resilient economies.</p>
<p>You know what that does when you have to try to build that stuff?</p>
<p>Prices go screaming higher because instead of having one factory in China making 9 billion</p>
<p>iPhone cases, you have now 50 factories all around the world, each with their own infrastructures</p>
<p>and costs and whatever.</p>
<p>And so I think you&rsquo;re going to reflate the world.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when it happens, but that&rsquo;s sort of the biggest risk to all of what we do is</p>
<p>that all of a sudden, you know, real rates go to like six or seven percent.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden, you&rsquo;re not going to look at a company trading at 50 times earnings</p>
<p>and say, you know, you&rsquo;re going to question that.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s the biggest risk that I think.</p>
<p>Friedberg, what&rsquo;s your risk?</p>
<p>Sachs, what&rsquo;s your risk?</p>
<p>Sachs, you go ahead.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So actually, mine is pretty similar to Tomas, which is I think we&rsquo;re accruing these unpayable</p>
<p>deficits and debts and obligations.</p>
<p>And, you know, all this money has to be paid back at some point that the U.S.</p>
<p>government&rsquo;s incurring.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a California version of this where we&rsquo;ve accrued a trillion dollars of</p>
<p>pension obligations that we have no ability to pay.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I mean, I think that eventually it translates into inflation, but I think</p>
<p>it translates into something even worse, which is at some point people become skeptical about</p>
<p>loaning money to the U.S. government because they don&rsquo;t want the U.S. to be able to just</p>
<p>print dollars to pay back these loans.</p>
<p>And the U.S. dollar stops becoming the world&rsquo;s reserve currency.</p>
<p>I think the reason why we&rsquo;re seeing Bitcoin go to the moon right now is people are starting</p>
<p>to speculate on the idea that this might be the future world reserve currency because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not subject to manipulation by central banks.</p>
<p>And, you know, and let&rsquo;s think like that world looks ‚Äì if you think about like a world</p>
<p>in which the U.S. dollar is not the world&rsquo;s reserve currency anymore, in which the government</p>
<p>is basically broke, I mean, that is ‚Äì it&rsquo;s pretty scary to think about.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a Ray Dalio who&rsquo;s a famous and, you know, prominent hedge fund founder of</p>
<p>Bridgewater Associates wrote an essay, if anyone&rsquo;s interested, called The Big Cycle</p>
<p>of Money, Credit, Debt, and Economic Activity.</p>
<p>You can find it online.</p>
<p>He published it last year.</p>
<p>Highly recommended reading.</p>
<p>He has a few chapters that proceed and follow that talks about the grand macroeconomic cycle</p>
<p>of governments and societies, and it&rsquo;s really worth the read.</p>
<p>I think one really basic principled economic point is that governments operate in such</p>
<p>a way that their people ask for goods and ask for services.</p>
<p>The government spends on those services by borrowing more than they&rsquo;re making in income</p>
<p>in that year, and that is, I think, the premise for a lot of how governments operate around</p>
<p>the world.</p>
<p>The only way that that works over time is if your future shows that that borrowing allows</p>
<p>you to grow your revenue more, and therefore, you can underwrite taking on debt to pay in</p>
<p>the future.</p>
<p>So, you force growth.</p>
<p>And, you know, I&rsquo;ve said this a couple of times before, but it is the most basic principle,</p>
<p>but it is also the most scary and shocking principle, which is the only way you can afford</p>
<p>debt is if you have growth, and that forces you to find growth.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re forced to find growth, you get all of these unnatural perturbations in</p>
<p>terms of economic activity and market forces.</p>
<p>It is not necessarily the case that things should and would always grow.</p>
<p>And we force things to always grow because of the mechanism by which we fund our services</p>
<p>at a government level, and that is what&rsquo;s basically going to ultimately lead to a lot</p>
<p>of different types of crises, both kind of financial crises but also societal crises</p>
<p>in terms of, you know, revolution and pushes for socialism and all the other things that</p>
<p>are typically associated with things like inflation.</p>
<p>And so, it is the big crisis of the 21st century will be, you know, we underwrote growth in</p>
<p>the 20th century.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of forces that may kind of, you know, bring that all to kind of bear</p>
<p>this century.</p>
<p>I see one that&rsquo;s maybe a little less acute and a little bit more big picture, which is</p>
<p>the number of people living in democracies in the world as a percentage of population,</p>
<p>which has been going down, which if you asked anybody, they would be pretty shocked to hear.</p>
<p>But just looking at the percentage of humans on the planet, not the percentage of countries,</p>
<p>because the percentage of countries that are democracies or, you know, flawed democracies</p>
<p>is right now at, you know, 45%.</p>
<p>And we have 55% of regimes are authoritarian or hybrid.</p>
<p>And the population of people living in those is growing.</p>
<p>We have countries that are authoritarian that are growing countries that are democracies,</p>
<p>like in Europe or in the West and the US, Canada are declining or not keeping up pace</p>
<p>in terms of population growth.</p>
<p>And that is, I think, going to be the major issue, which is does China win capitalism</p>
<p>plus authoritarianism?</p>
<p>Or does democracy plus capitalism work?</p>
<p>The next question I think is super fascinating, which is what would each of you wish you could</p>
<p>teach every 12 year old right now?</p>
<p>What a great question.</p>
<p>Chamath, you want to go first?</p>
<p>Do you have something that comes to mind?</p>
<p>We need a minute to think about it.</p>
<p>Wow, it&rsquo;s such a fabulous question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many answers.</p>
<p>Very personal for all of us.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many answers there.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s workshop it.</p>
<p>Anybody have a thought?</p>
<p>What comes to mind?</p>
<p>This is very tactical.</p>
<p>Okay, so I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s like grander things.</p>
<p>But just the two things we&rsquo;re not really teaching are coding and financial literacy.</p>
<p>Those are like the two big, I think, omissions in the curriculum right now.</p>
<p>And would be very helpful for people to learn.</p>
<p>Oh, I mean, on that theme, I would also then add</p>
<p>better eating habits and mental health exercises.</p>
<p>Freeberg, you got any that come to mind?</p>
<p>Things you want your 12 year old or everybody&rsquo;s 12 year old to learn?</p>
<p>I think the principles of biology and how we&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, again, I feel like we underestimate.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t talk enough about the opportunity and the reality</p>
<p>that is about to hit us like a tidal wave of bioengineering.</p>
<p>Everything in medicine is moving towards this notion of using biological machines</p>
<p>to fix our bodies.</p>
<p>Not just a molecule, which is the historical way of doing medicine,</p>
<p>where you find a molecule, it does something in the body, you stick it in,</p>
<p>you turn it into a drug.</p>
<p>But we are actually on the precipice of creating machines, biologically engineered</p>
<p>or designed cells and proteins that can go into your body and do specific things</p>
<p>and enhance your life and improve your health and solve disease.</p>
<p>Similarly, like I talked about earlier,</p>
<p>biomanufacturing to make all the materials and food</p>
<p>in a more sustainable way and a lower cost way.</p>
<p>And so, I think teaching the principles of DNA,</p>
<p>how DNA causes protein, how protein causes function,</p>
<p>and how cells operate and how that is basically being softwareized.</p>
<p>And you can basically think about biology now as being software.</p>
<p>I think that is the trend of science and engineering.</p>
<p>I think computing created a great foundation.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s really&hellip;</p>
<p>If I were to tell my 12-year-old daughter in eight years what she should consider doing</p>
<p>or spending her time studying,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s bioengineering and what the opportunities are that are going to arise from that.</p>
<p>All great answers.</p>
<p>I think for me, again, move it up a level since you guys took some of my answers.</p>
<p>Financial literacy was definitely going to be in there for me.</p>
<p>But I would say radical self-reliance and entrepreneurialism and resiliency.</p>
<p>I think a lot of young people right now don&rsquo;t believe that they have agency in their lives,</p>
<p>in the world, that they can create stuff, that they cannot be stopped if they go and do something.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a victim mentality and culture that the system is rigged against you and</p>
<p>that you cannot rise above, which I understand why people feel that way.</p>
<p>But I actually think it&rsquo;s less true than ever.</p>
<p>And so we have to basically really remind people that if you are radically self-reliant,</p>
<p>you can live the American dream.</p>
<p>You can create anything you want.</p>
<p>There is absolutely nobody who can stop you.</p>
<p>And all the knowledge you want to learn is out there.</p>
<p>In radical self-reliance, for me, is this concept of the ability to learn.</p>
<p>And the ability to learn how to learn and having faith that you can learn any skill,</p>
<p>even 60%, 70% very quickly, is what I see results in people being successful in life.</p>
<p>This ability to take on any new topic with a zeal and an understanding that you can master it.</p>
<p>Or even 60% or 70% mastery means something.</p>
<p>Going around the horn, we&rsquo;re going to plan a bestie trip.</p>
<p>And we might even allow besties to come for the first live bestie show.</p>
<p>What is your vote?</p>
<p>I want everybody to type it into the chat room.</p>
<p>I everybody&rsquo;s going to type in where they most want to have a bestie show.</p>
<p>All right, I like it.</p>
<p>Okay, so Chamath and I both want to go to New York.</p>
<p>Sax wants to go to Miami to see Keith Raboy and Peter Thiel, his besties.</p>
<p>Those are his alternate universe besties, by the way.</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t do a podcast together.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Oh my God, how great would that podcast be?</p>
<p>I think that would be, I think you call that the righties.</p>
<p>The righties.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got the besties, you&rsquo;ve got the leasties, and you&rsquo;re going to get the righties.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting the leasties.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be me, Howard Linzen, Sarah Cohn, and Prof G, Prof G.</p>
<p>Now, why wouldn&rsquo;t you call it the worsties?</p>
<p>The worsties.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do the worsties just as a thing.</p>
<p>I had an idea.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an idea.</p>
<p>If we want to be the number one podcast, Friedberg, do you have any of that Molly from your 1999,</p>
<p>2000 era?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never done Molly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never done Molly.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>You just made your own synthesis of it and took it.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how we become the number one podcast.</p>
<p>We all take Molly at the start of the podcast, and we start the podcast 30 minutes in, and</p>
<p>then we see if David Sax can say, I love you.</p>
<p>Can I just say we&rsquo;ve done more self-referential naval gazing bullshit on this pod than any</p>
<p>other pod, and I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>This is like even worse than-</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to listen to it, people.</p>
<p>We may need to spike-</p>
<p>This is worse than Vlad.</p>
<p>Nick will need to edit the fuck out of this and spike it.</p>
<p>Spike it.</p>
<p>All right, boys.</p>
<p>Here we-</p>
<p>Love you.</p>
<p>All right, boys.</p>
<p>I love you, besties.</p>
<p>Love you, David.</p>
<p>I gotcha.</p>
<p>Love you, other David.</p>
<p>I gotcha.</p>
<p>Love you, Chamath Palapatiya.</p>
<p>We upgraded the Davids, by the way.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s why we added the thirst trap feature set.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why he went to throbbing and pulsating.</p>
<p>He was just throbbing and pulsating.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see you all next time on the All In Pod.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you, besties.</p>
<p>The queen of quinoa.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>What your winner&rsquo;s line?</p>
<p>What your winner&rsquo;s line?</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>That is my dog taking a notice in your driveway.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>My avatar will meet me at-</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>What the beep.</p>
<p>What the beep.</p>
<p>What the beep.</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
