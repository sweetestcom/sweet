    <p>It&rsquo;s Hardcore History Addendum.</p>
<p>So, in this Hardcore History Addendum,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to have a friend of mine on the program,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna be kind of a cross-cast</p>
<p>between his show and mine.</p>
<p>And I hope you&rsquo;ll pardon me, I have a cold right now,</p>
<p>so things are a little&hellip;</p>
<p>-&hellip;less than perfect. Um, his name is Daniele Bolelli,</p>
<p>by the way, and you may know him</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s a famous history podcaster.</p>
<p>He does History on Fire, uh, he has another podcast</p>
<p>called The Drunken Taoist, and we&rsquo;ve been friends</p>
<p>for a long time, and, uh, he&rsquo;s wonderful,</p>
<p>that wonderful lyrical voice of his</p>
<p>and the way he looks at the past.</p>
<p>And we had been talking about doing a program together</p>
<p>for a while, and the stars just kind of aligned.</p>
<p>This was recorded a couple of weeks ago, actually,</p>
<p>um, which is good, because like I said, I have a cold now.</p>
<p>Um, but Daniele came on, he had a couple of things</p>
<p>he wanted to talk about, and so that&rsquo;s sort of the, um,</p>
<p>the gist for how the show kind of went</p>
<p>in the direction it did.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have a few thoughts afterwards,</p>
<p>because, you know, as it always seems to happen, right?</p>
<p>I thought of a good point or two or something</p>
<p>I should have brought up during the discussion and didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;ll call that a footnote to the show you&rsquo;re about</p>
<p>to hear, the cross-cast between yours truly</p>
<p>and, uh, my friend, the great Daniele Bolelli.</p>
<p>Okay, Dan, let&rsquo;s get playing.</p>
<p>One topic that I found fascinating as of late,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing a lot on social media, some efforts to&hellip;</p>
<p>kind of redefine terms. This is mostly happening in U.S.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this is a discussion</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really happening in other parts of the world,</p>
<p>but in U.S., I&rsquo;m seeing a lot of discussion</p>
<p>regarding the political spectrum,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s left-wing, what&rsquo;s right-wing,</p>
<p>where phenomena like fascism and Nazism</p>
<p>fit into the spectrum.</p>
<p>And, you know, personally, I find the whole left-wing,</p>
<p>right-wing discussion almost intellectually lazy,</p>
<p>because to me, it&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m not even interested</p>
<p>in if it&rsquo;s an idea that comes from the left-wing</p>
<p>or a right-wing. To me, an idea is either a good idea</p>
<p>or a bad idea. Who cares where it comes from?</p>
<p>So, even thinking in those terms,</p>
<p>to me, encourages factionalism.</p>
<p>However, having said that, if we insist on using these terms</p>
<p>like left-wing, right-wing,</p>
<p>then we should probably use them correctly.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m seeing these days is a major attempt</p>
<p>to change the way the terms have been used historically.</p>
<p>Kind of reminds me of the Princess Bride,</p>
<p>you know, when they say, you keep using this word,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it means what you think it means.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of the feeling I&rsquo;m getting in this discussion.</p>
<p>So, I would love to get your take on,</p>
<p>and, you know, we can jump into a whole discussion</p>
<p>on this thing regarding the political spectrum,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s changing, the meaning of it,</p>
<p>what it used to mean historically, and all of that.</p>
<p>Well, I think a little background probably makes sense</p>
<p>before we get started, because I think we should acknowledge</p>
<p>one thing right off the top, and that&rsquo;s that the idea</p>
<p>of the political spectrum is a human-created thing.</p>
<p>And so, and not just a human-created thing,</p>
<p>but something that sort of developed organically</p>
<p>in revolutionary era France that was then sort of morphed</p>
<p>into something that was used ever since.</p>
<p>And ever since, people have been trying to figure out</p>
<p>how you make it better, because it&rsquo;s such an imperfect way</p>
<p>to describe political positions.</p>
<p>So, as you and I both know, but let&rsquo;s review,</p>
<p>in pre-revolutionary and early revolutionary France,</p>
<p>you have an assembly where all the people meet.</p>
<p>And from the speaker&rsquo;s platform on the assembly,</p>
<p>the people who were the honored aristocratic movers</p>
<p>and shakers, bluebloods in that society,</p>
<p>sat on the right side of the assembly.</p>
<p>And the bourgeois, we would today call them middle class</p>
<p>or upper middle class, the businessmen,</p>
<p>all the merchants, they sat on the left.</p>
<p>And then that became, you know, the beginnings</p>
<p>of where people would say, you know, a man on the left</p>
<p>or a man of the right.</p>
<p>And so, that&rsquo;s where that initially comes from.</p>
<p>And then that became sort of the shorthand</p>
<p>that was transposed onto later political systems</p>
<p>forever afterwards, whether or not it was</p>
<p>a really good description of other societies,</p>
<p>other countries, political systems in places</p>
<p>far removed from revolutionary France.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s how it starts.</p>
<p>And then from there on, what we have here</p>
<p>is a human created system that is designed</p>
<p>to try to provide a shorthand, if you will,</p>
<p>for people&rsquo;s political persuasions.</p>
<p>And ever since, people have realized how inadequate</p>
<p>it is to describe, you know, something as complex</p>
<p>as people&rsquo;s political beliefs.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why ever since there have been attempts</p>
<p>to three-dimensionalize it, or create another axis</p>
<p>to measure other things that the left-right</p>
<p>political spectrum doesn&rsquo;t measure.</p>
<p>And so, in that case, what we have here now</p>
<p>is a spectrum which doesn&rsquo;t resemble the one</p>
<p>that you and I grew up with.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 53, you&rsquo;re younger than I am,</p>
<p>but both of us grew up in an era where</p>
<p>the original traditional, let&rsquo;s call it traditional</p>
<p>for lack of a better word, political spectrum</p>
<p>was in force.</p>
<p>And in that spectrum, just so that we have</p>
<p>a benchmark from where we can have this conversation from,</p>
<p>speaking as an American, you grew up</p>
<p>in a different environment.</p>
<p>But in the United States, we were taught,</p>
<p>when I was a kid, that the United States</p>
<p>and other Western democracies fell somewhere</p>
<p>in the middle of the spectrum.</p>
<p>And that both ends of the spectrum,</p>
<p>either the far left or the far right,</p>
<p>represented extremist philosophies.</p>
<p>Different kinds of extremist philosophies,</p>
<p>but extremist philosophies.</p>
<p>And so, that&rsquo;s where it started.</p>
<p>So, the far left, when we were growing up,</p>
<p>was always communism.</p>
<p>The far right was always fascism.</p>
<p>And so, that&rsquo;s why you and I are confused</p>
<p>when we hear people today speak about, for example,</p>
<p>the Nazis being on the left side of the spectrum,</p>
<p>because on the traditional one,</p>
<p>it was always the right side of the spectrum.</p>
<p>Now, I should point out that I had a political science</p>
<p>professor in the 1980s in college,</p>
<p>and this was the first time I ever heard anybody say this,</p>
<p>who said that, really, maybe we should think</p>
<p>of that linear political spectrum as more of a circle.</p>
<p>And that the two halves, the two extremes</p>
<p>actually have many things in common.</p>
<p>So, maybe they touch on the other end.</p>
<p>But so, when we have this discussion,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s remember that this is the spectrum</p>
<p>you and I were operating from,</p>
<p>and that most people from our era and before understood.</p>
<p>So, now, let&rsquo;s go from there.</p>
<p>So, why don&rsquo;t you start by explaining</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re seeing out there that is so discomforting?</p>
<p>Well, start, like, to throw a wrench</p>
<p>into that political spectrum,</p>
<p>which, by the way, it&rsquo;s exactly correct, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly how we grew up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it was always defined.</p>
<p>But take something like anarchism.</p>
<p>Anarchism traditionally was considered</p>
<p>an extreme left position.</p>
<p>And here you have, you know, communism and fascism,</p>
<p>or communism and Nazism being one considered extreme right</p>
<p>and one extreme left, but they are both shared the fact</p>
<p>that they are totalitarian systems.</p>
<p>Anarchism, on the other hand, by going radically</p>
<p>against the very idea of the state,</p>
<p>seems to be at the opposite end of totalitarianism.</p>
<p>And yet it was never defined in any way, shape, or form</p>
<p>as a right-wing concept.</p>
<p>It was considered ultra-extreme left.</p>
<p>So, what I find weird in this is plugging certain movements</p>
<p>that, you know, they have defined themselves</p>
<p>as conservative right-wing.</p>
<p>Their opponents define them as conservative right-wing.</p>
<p>Everyone involved was very clear about who they were</p>
<p>and what was up, and now kind of trying</p>
<p>to completely change the meaning of what</p>
<p>used to be something that was pretty much understood</p>
<p>by everybody.</p>
<p>I mean, to me, it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s funny because growing up</p>
<p>in Italy, I&rsquo;ve been very familiar with lots</p>
<p>of people who are fascists.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in conversation with people who are neo-Nazis.</p>
<p>So to me, this is not even like a theoretical debate.</p>
<p>These are actual flesh and blood people who I&rsquo;ve spoken to.</p>
<p>And if you tell these people that they are left-wing,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to see the consequences</p>
<p>because they hate anything to do with the term left-wing</p>
<p>already make them go berserk, and they hate that.</p>
<p>So the fact that today in the US,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing this redefining of the spectrum that basically</p>
<p>places all of the totalitarian movements from communists,</p>
<p>which everybody argue they are left-wings.</p>
<p>There is no disagreement there.</p>
<p>But from fascists and Nazis, who are traditionally</p>
<p>considered right-wing, suddenly plugging them</p>
<p>all as left-wing phenomenon, I find</p>
<p>that really bizarre.</p>
<p>Like to me, it seemed like a post-modernist attempt</p>
<p>to redefine, to rewrite the dictionary.</p>
<p>Well, now let me interrupt you because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>exactly what it is.</p>
<p>But the, and here&rsquo;s the thing, the people</p>
<p>who did this redefining were very open about it.</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t a secret.</p>
<p>The problem is, is that many of the people who quote them</p>
<p>or who ascribe to the same theory</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t realize that it&rsquo;s a redefinition.</p>
<p>So for example, I said in our little introduction</p>
<p>that there have been many attempts since we were kids</p>
<p>to try to figure out a better way to define</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s political positions other than this very</p>
<p>limiting linear way.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s one of the examples out there</p>
<p>that was done as a person who decided</p>
<p>to make the question of freedom the defining force.</p>
<p>So right, so the political spectrum kind of plugs in X</p>
<p>and Y what you want, and they can end up</p>
<p>showing what you want depending on the parameters you choose.</p>
<p>So if you decide that freedom is going</p>
<p>to be the basis for what moves the needle on your spectrum,</p>
<p>well, then yes, one direction might</p>
<p>go in the direction of more free and another direction</p>
<p>and less free, in which case all the totalitarian systems,</p>
<p>regardless of their economic viewpoints or whatever,</p>
<p>belong on one end.</p>
<p>And as you said, anarchism probably</p>
<p>belongs on the other far extreme.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any problem with people redefining</p>
<p>the political spectrum as long as they understand</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>Well, and also not using the wrong terminology</p>
<p>because if we&rsquo;re using freedom, I completely agree.</p>
<p>You can put anarchism on one extreme.</p>
<p>You can put totalitarian ideologies</p>
<p>at the other extreme.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s nothing left or right about this.</p>
<p>This is just a new way of looking at things.</p>
<p>So we shouldn&rsquo;t probably use the terms left wing, right wing,</p>
<p>which traditionally had a completely different meaning,</p>
<p>and plug them into a spectrum that just</p>
<p>is something else entirely.</p>
<p>Well, and let&rsquo;s understand, too, a little bit</p>
<p>about what the differences of this always were.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So for example, when you go back to the original French version,</p>
<p>I mean, those people that were sitting</p>
<p>on the right side of the assembly,</p>
<p>those are monarchists, right?</p>
<p>So the extremes in the original system we&rsquo;re talking about here</p>
<p>are people that support the church, the aristocracy,</p>
<p>the monarchy, and the status quo.</p>
<p>The people on the left side, until you got the Jacobins</p>
<p>and all that, were actually the equality, liberty,</p>
<p>laissez-faire capitalism, maybe.</p>
<p>Take that with a grain of salt. But by the standards</p>
<p>of the time.</p>
<p>And those things change with the times.</p>
<p>I mean, certainly, if we were going</p>
<p>to talk about what left wing and right wing were in the 1930s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be very different than what</p>
<p>they were in the 1790s.</p>
<p>But I mean, from that basis, there</p>
<p>are fundamental differences between the views of the two.</p>
<p>I mean, let me give you an example.</p>
<p>So when you look at the Nazis, one</p>
<p>of the things that catches people up in the United States</p>
<p>is the name, the National Socialist German Workers</p>
<p>Party, right?</p>
<p>So for everyone out there who doesn&rsquo;t know it,</p>
<p>if we asked what kind of a government,</p>
<p>the North Korean government of today was,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a hereditary dictatorship, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what it is, right?</p>
<p>This is the guy in charge there is the third generation,</p>
<p>father, son, grandfather of a dictatorial regime</p>
<p>that brooks no opposition and has no legislative body</p>
<p>with any power at all.</p>
<p>Yet the official name of that country</p>
<p>is the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of North Korea.</p>
<p>That is marketing, right?</p>
<p>That is marketing.</p>
<p>That is exactly what the German Workers Party is.</p>
<p>I mean, to Hitler and his people,</p>
<p>the Nazi party of that early era,</p>
<p>workers was the same as voters.</p>
<p>And this was a political marketing attempt</p>
<p>to try to swing voters.</p>
<p>And by the way, the centrist party</p>
<p>of Germany in that time period had workers in their name.</p>
<p>So this is not an unusual thing.</p>
<p>And so that, but that, but Americans get,</p>
<p>get so hyped up when they see the word socialist or workers</p>
<p>that they automatically assume, okay,</p>
<p>what we have here are Bolsheviks,</p>
<p>which is nothing of the sort.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I can&rsquo;t think of anyone more opposed</p>
<p>to Bolsheviks than Nazis.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, Hitler blamed them, you know,</p>
<p>built his whole platform in absolute opposition</p>
<p>to communism.</p>
<p>He was, he blamed socialists for contributing to Germany</p>
<p>losing World War I.</p>
<p>He, you know, if you look at when he took power,</p>
<p>he got rid of the more left-leaning element</p>
<p>who were sympathizing with the Nazi movement,</p>
<p>squashed them all with the night of the long knives.</p>
<p>Some of the first people he sent to labor camps</p>
<p>were socialists.</p>
<p>So, I mean, it seemed like there&rsquo;s enough evidence there</p>
<p>that the little marketing ploy in the name</p>
<p>should be pretty obvious to everybody.</p>
<p>Well, and for those of you, there are German scholars</p>
<p>out there who realize, I mean, it&rsquo;s known as Strasserism.</p>
<p>Otto Strasser was, was part of the very early Nazi parties.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just call it the philosophical wing,</p>
<p>for lack of a better word.</p>
<p>And he would have been more what Americans think of</p>
<p>when they accused the Nazis of being a socialist movement,</p>
<p>but he was purged early on.</p>
<p>I mean, so that side of it, I mean, Hitler took over,</p>
<p>we would call it today a corporate shell.</p>
<p>He went in, saw a group of people</p>
<p>who already were meeting.</p>
<p>I think there were like 20 of them, he said in Mein Kampf,</p>
<p>and he went in there and stole their movement</p>
<p>and got rid of the things he didn&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>but the name stuck.</p>
<p>You know, I have Mein Kampf sitting here in front of me.</p>
<p>And, you know, I read it for our little conversation here</p>
<p>for like the 15th time.</p>
<p>I always feel like people that call the Nazis left wing</p>
<p>have never read this book because Hitler actually slams</p>
<p>the left by name, the left, over and over and over again.</p>
<p>He says they chose red for the Nazi flag colors</p>
<p>just to piss off the Bolsheviks and communists, right?</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re stealing their stuff</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re rubbing it in their faces.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like literally if you open Mein Kampf</p>
<p>and read five pages, it would all be clear, right?</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t even be an issue.</p>
<p>So I, again, I find like some of these,</p>
<p>part of the reason why it bugs me a little</p>
<p>is because I feel that it is a disingenuous attempt,</p>
<p>like that some of the people who have been pushing this notion</p>
<p>are doing so not because they actually believe it,</p>
<p>but because it&rsquo;s a slander to call somebody a Nazi</p>
<p>or a fascist in the modern political climate.</p>
<p>So the idea becomes let&rsquo;s paint those guys</p>
<p>as the Nazis and fascists because then, you know,</p>
<p>we score a point over them more</p>
<p>because they actually believe it.</p>
<p>Because if you actually believe it,</p>
<p>now you got a serious problem with reading comprehension</p>
<p>because it really doesn&rsquo;t take much to see the difference.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, you see, you jumped in front of where I was.</p>
<p>I was going to set that whole qui bono thing up here,</p>
<p>like, because the more interesting question</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t were the Nazis left wing or right wing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why does anybody care?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right. I mean, what&rsquo;s the practical re&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, you know, we have arguments over this today</p>
<p>and you go, why?</p>
<p>I mean, this is a 75-year-old issue.</p>
<p>The only reason it matters is how it applies</p>
<p>to the modern political situation.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a reason that tarring one side or the other</p>
<p>with this label is important.</p>
<p>Now, to get back to our political spectrum</p>
<p>when we were a kid in the United States,</p>
<p>again, I can&rsquo;t speak for Italy,</p>
<p>because when I went to Italy as a kid,</p>
<p>they had a red flag with a hammer and sickle</p>
<p>on some of the buildings in Rome.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. I thought that there was like 30%</p>
<p>of the country was communist or something.</p>
<p>Exactly. A little different than what I grew up with.</p>
<p>But in this country, the reason that we were taught</p>
<p>that the two extremes of the political system were bad</p>
<p>was because, you know, this was to teach us&hellip;</p>
<p>For example, let me back up.</p>
<p>In 1964, Barry Goldwater, a senator from Arizona,</p>
<p>ran for president against Lyndon Johnson.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Barry Goldwater&rsquo;s often labeled as the father</p>
<p>of the modern conservative movement.</p>
<p>So where you get away from the country club Republicans</p>
<p>and you get down to the Ronald Reagan kind of Republicans,</p>
<p>a very different sort of breed.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Those guys, um, you know, uh, um&hellip;</p>
<p>Goldwater had famously said that extremism</p>
<p>in the defense of liberty is no vice.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the kind of guy that would have approved</p>
<p>of a political spectrum where liberty was what moved</p>
<p>the needle one way or the other.</p>
<p>Um, in a case like Goldwater, um,</p>
<p>the idea that we can look at different movements</p>
<p>in the United States as extreme, it was a warning, right?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t go too far to the left, because if you do,</p>
<p>you take the left-leaning ideas that form something</p>
<p>like liberalism, and you take them to the extreme,</p>
<p>and you get to a dangerous territory like communism.</p>
<p>And if you take the right-wing views, which, you know,</p>
<p>would be a conservative political viewpoint</p>
<p>in America, and you take them to extremes,</p>
<p>you end up with fascism.</p>
<p>Well, in the modern era, I mean, I remember</p>
<p>Jonah Goldberg wrote a book called Liberal Fascism,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s&hellip; He, along with others,</p>
<p>try to trace a development that links liberalism to Nazism</p>
<p>as a way to warn you about the dangers of liberalism, right?</p>
<p>These people are on the road to Nazism,</p>
<p>because Nazism&rsquo;s the worst thing we can think of.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a way, you know, to say that, you know,</p>
<p>if you move farther and farther to the right,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no bad thing on the edge of that, right?</p>
<p>In the old days, you would say,</p>
<p>hey, don&rsquo;t go too far to the right,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s bad for everybody.</p>
<p>Well, if you redefine the political spectrum</p>
<p>so that the right has no connection</p>
<p>to nasty political outcomes, well, then, hey,</p>
<p>just moving farther to the right&rsquo;s always good, right?</p>
<p>So there is&hellip; You know, I used to say to right-wingers,</p>
<p>if we go farther to the right, what happens that&rsquo;s bad?</p>
<p>Does it ever reach a point that&rsquo;s negative?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the qui bono part,</p>
<p>that there are people trying to redefine the idea</p>
<p>that going to the extremes,</p>
<p>to the right side of the political spectrum,</p>
<p>have any bad outcome at all.</p>
<p>That, to me, is the problem.</p>
<p>So when Goldwater said extremism</p>
<p>in the defense of liberty is no vice,</p>
<p>this is the attitude that if you go to the extreme right,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing bad about that</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re going to get more free.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re absolutely correct.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s exactly the issue</p>
<p>with framing it as a left-right thing,</p>
<p>as opposed to totalitarianism versus freedom.</p>
<p>I understand totalitarianism versus individual rights.</p>
<p>That makes perfect sense to me.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t plug it into a political model</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t reflect that at all,</p>
<p>because traditionally there have been</p>
<p>extremely totalitarian left-wing movement</p>
<p>and extremely totalitarian right-wing movement.</p>
<p>What makes them left-wing and right-wing</p>
<p>is not how powerful the state is,</p>
<p>because, again, both sides did it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s other issues.</p>
<p>Like, for example, in the case of the Nazis,</p>
<p>a few of the things that clearly would mark them more</p>
<p>on the right-wing side of things</p>
<p>and why people who are more conservative supported them,</p>
<p>you had the desire to crash labor unions</p>
<p>was a key thing that helped them be popular</p>
<p>with some of the industrialists in Germany.</p>
<p>The desire to go against minimum wage.</p>
<p>Also big in terms of culture wars.</p>
<p>You know, there was a whole wave of gay rights,</p>
<p>feminism, more open sexuality that was sweeping in Germany,</p>
<p>and that Nazism was strongly preaching against.</p>
<p>So taking a more conservative attitude</p>
<p>in terms of even issues that would be recognized today</p>
<p>as part of the culture wars.</p>
<p>So, you know, to me, those are the things</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what makes somebody in that case.</p>
<p>And also, sorry, one thing that I forgot,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s probably the most important one of all,</p>
<p>is that the base of the whole Nazi movement</p>
<p>was built on nationalism and race,</p>
<p>whereas traditionally the other extreme,</p>
<p>you know, the communists were all about</p>
<p>the more international, global perspective.</p>
<p>And class.</p>
<p>Exactly. You know, the one was about class.</p>
<p>The other one was not.</p>
<p>The other one, the focus was on race and nation.</p>
<p>One was hierarchical.</p>
<p>One was at least theoretically, of course, not in reality,</p>
<p>but at least theoretically in favor of equality.</p>
<p>One was heavily in bed</p>
<p>with the traditional religious institutions.</p>
<p>The other one was atheist or pushing</p>
<p>a more liberation theology</p>
<p>if they ever flirted with religious ideas.</p>
<p>So, I mean, when you look at it in those terms,</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t be more different,</p>
<p>despite the fact that they were both totalitarians</p>
<p>who wanted a strong state.</p>
<p>Well, look at the company they keep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always what I, I mean, domestically,</p>
<p>as you pointed out, I mean,</p>
<p>the Nazis were taking donations from big business.</p>
<p>I mean, the whole idea behind socialism</p>
<p>is that the people own the means of production.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, my goodness, the Germans of the 1940s</p>
<p>had companies like Krupp and Messerschmitt</p>
<p>and Porsche and Henschel.</p>
<p>And, I mean, you know, IG Farben.</p>
<p>I mean, and those guys didn&rsquo;t go away.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not at all like what you would see</p>
<p>in a communist country.</p>
<p>And look at the allies that the Germans had.</p>
<p>I mean, you mentioned the Italians,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s look at the Japanese.</p>
<p>I mean, you could never spin the Japanese</p>
<p>as a left-wing regime under any system.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a divine emperor system, right?</p>
<p>And, you know, I mean, for these people that say</p>
<p>that dictatorships and that kind of lack of freedom</p>
<p>is left-wing, well, what was the czar of Russia</p>
<p>before the communists took over?</p>
<p>I mean, that is the ultimate right-wing regime</p>
<p>by any stretch of the imagination.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right-wing by the French Assembly definition</p>
<p>of right-wing, right?</p>
<p>Those are authoritarian monarchists.</p>
<p>The Japanese are not going to ally with a left-wing regime.</p>
<p>Look at Francisco Franco.</p>
<p>Look at all of the people that fall into the fascist orbit,</p>
<p>even, you know, Juan Per√≥n in places like Argentina later.</p>
<p>None of these people fit the socialist model,</p>
<p>even if the name National Socialist</p>
<p>seems to imply that that&rsquo;s what they are.</p>
<p>Absolutely, and I think that&rsquo;s what I find upsetting.</p>
<p>Also, I think for me, there&rsquo;s a little bit</p>
<p>of a personal element, because, you know,</p>
<p>when I think about just not long ago,</p>
<p>when I think about family history,</p>
<p>you know, my grandmother was literally placing bomb</p>
<p>to blow up fascists.</p>
<p>My, you know, there&rsquo;s a whole,</p>
<p>without even going into the whole family biography,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s enough there where these were things</p>
<p>that people felt very strongly about,</p>
<p>where it wasn&rsquo;t like some academic philosophical debates</p>
<p>about terminology, and it was very real</p>
<p>in terms of who your enemies are and who they aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And so this effort to muddle the waters,</p>
<p>I find it really insulting, ultimately,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s kind of like changing history</p>
<p>to suit one&rsquo;s own need in the present.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not unusual either.</p>
<p>I remember when I was on the radio in the 1990s</p>
<p>here in Oregon, there was a group called</p>
<p>the Oregon Citizens Alliance, and they were an anti-gay group.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know if they&rsquo;re still around,</p>
<p>but one of their members wrote a book</p>
<p>called The Pink Swastika, and the whole point</p>
<p>was the same thing you&rsquo;re seeing in the modern-day world</p>
<p>where people are trying to link Nazism</p>
<p>to the current American left as a way to tar and feather them.</p>
<p>In this case, this anti-gay group was trying to link</p>
<p>Nazism to gay rights as a way to tar and feather them.</p>
<p>I mean, the Nazis have become the wonderful,</p>
<p>and I use them in my own show this way,</p>
<p>because they are the benchmark for evil.</p>
<p>But, I mean, like, for example, I have a quote here</p>
<p>from a story that I printed out for this discussion today,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s from some historians who are talking</p>
<p>about the same thing we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>And they were explaining, let me read the post,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re talking about all these different</p>
<p>right-wing writers that have tried to redefine Nazism</p>
<p>as a movement of the left, as a way to tar and feather</p>
<p>modern people on the left.</p>
<p>And they wrote as a concluding line this.</p>
<p>They wrote,</p>
<p>Herewith we come to the effect, if not the point,</p>
<p>of the revisionist exposition.</p>
<p>It is not only to transfer the stigma</p>
<p>of the Second World War&rsquo;s genocidal violence</p>
<p>from the right to the left,</p>
<p>so that criticisms of radicalized populism</p>
<p>can be dismissed as leftist fascism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also to suggest that the war was a crusade</p>
<p>against state collectivism of all types,</p>
<p>including the welfare state,</p>
<p>for which many Westerners, in fact, fought.</p>
<p>They reasoned by means of a simplistic,</p>
<p>ahistorical syllogism.</p>
<p>Since socialism is statism slash collectivism,</p>
<p>like public health and public transport,</p>
<p>and Nazism was statist and collectivist,</p>
<p>and promoted public health and public transport,</p>
<p>social democratic public health and public transport</p>
<p>measures must be fascist.</p>
<p>In other words, if you have A and we have A,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re all A, right?</p>
<p>And that, to me, is what becomes</p>
<p>a sneaky little debating trick, is the best way to put it.</p>
<p>Because anybody who&rsquo;s read Mein Kampf</p>
<p>and thinks that Hitler would put up</p>
<p>with being called leftist</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t really read the book very carefully.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And I think it really boils down to,</p>
<p>I believe that there are people who honestly read</p>
<p>these things today and believe it,</p>
<p>probably because they haven&rsquo;t really read enough before.</p>
<p>But I think a lot of the people who are putting this stuff out</p>
<p>are doing so in a very disingenuous manner,</p>
<p>not because they believe it,</p>
<p>but purely as a political weapon to use</p>
<p>in their political fights today.</p>
<p>And again, you know, if we want to throw out</p>
<p>completely left-wing or right-wing, I&rsquo;m all for it.</p>
<p>Because I agree, I&rsquo;m interested in policies</p>
<p>that increase the degree of individual freedom.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in policy that help</p>
<p>the quality of human life.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care where they come from, you know?</p>
<p>So if you want to throw that out completely,</p>
<p>I have no problems with it.</p>
<p>But not redefining existing terms</p>
<p>according to what benefits somebody</p>
<p>in terms of their own political fights,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s just dishonest.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something else entirely.</p>
<p>Well, and you know, it&rsquo;s worth bringing up</p>
<p>what I think is a key ingredient</p>
<p>in the whole thing that isn&rsquo;t talked about enough.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the fact that, you know,</p>
<p>much of the comparison between the Nazis</p>
<p>and the communists involves Joseph Stalin.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a bit of a white, you know, in other words,</p>
<p>instead of Bolshevism,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re getting a little deep into the woods here,</p>
<p>but you have Stalinism.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a decent number of historians</p>
<p>that think that Joseph Stalin wasn&rsquo;t really a communist,</p>
<p>that he hid behind the communist sort of doctrine,</p>
<p>but was, and I&rsquo;m quoting here,</p>
<p>an old-style oriental despot,</p>
<p>in which case that makes him, yes,</p>
<p>more like a Hitler or a Mussolini,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t call him a communist then, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just an old-style dictator, right?</p>
<p>With a facade of communism,</p>
<p>because communism, for all its faults,</p>
<p>was not supposed to be a dictatorship.</p>
<p>There was going to be a dictatorship</p>
<p>of the proletariat stage,</p>
<p>but decisions weren&rsquo;t supposed to be</p>
<p>in the hands of one guy who, like Hitler,</p>
<p>called every shot.</p>
<p>Now, the fact that it actually works out that way</p>
<p>in Soviet Union, in Red China,</p>
<p>in the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an actual interesting point of its own,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not what it&rsquo;s supposed to be like,</p>
<p>and so those who say that communism and Nazism</p>
<p>are very similar, it might be less</p>
<p>because Hitler&rsquo;s like a communist</p>
<p>and more because Stalin&rsquo;s like a Nazi.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>No, in fact, and I think that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>the whole conversation gets interesting,</p>
<p>where the examples are,</p>
<p>and I think that the one you brought up</p>
<p>is a very interesting one in its own,</p>
<p>and maybe another time we can explore it,</p>
<p>you know, the why an ideology that, in theory,</p>
<p>is preaching this radical equality</p>
<p>turns out to be monstrously hierarchical,</p>
<p>despite saying, no, no, we are all equal,</p>
<p>when obviously, you know, anybody can see through it.</p>
<p>It was crap, it was just something to hide behind.</p>
<p>That becomes, in fact, one of the contradictions</p>
<p>in that movement that&rsquo;s interesting to explore.</p>
<p>I love Churchill&rsquo;s line about the equalization of misery.</p>
<p>Yeah, right, exactly.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s even that, like,</p>
<p>that clearly would not be a good scenario,</p>
<p>but even that&rsquo;s not real because it&rsquo;s not really equal.</p>
<p>You know, the guy, the last guy in the Soviet Union</p>
<p>and Stalin are gonna have very different lifestyles.</p>
<p>You know, they are not in the same boat at all.</p>
<p>So, yeah, fascinating, and I guess one thing I wanna,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, do you wanna add anything to this</p>
<p>or do you mind if I switch slightly in the conversation?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, but it&rsquo;s worth pointing out one thing,</p>
<p>and you brought it up earlier,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s this question of equality.</p>
<p>Whether or not it&rsquo;s possible, and whether or not</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually what the Bolsheviks or the Red Chinese</p>
<p>or the Khmer Rouge were actually out to do,</p>
<p>that is a key plank in the communist</p>
<p>slash socialist worldview,</p>
<p>whereas the Nazis did not believe in equality.</p>
<p>They specifically believed in the opposite,</p>
<p>the uber-mensch concept, basically,</p>
<p>that there are master people and there are subject people.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, communism and socialism have this,</p>
<p>you know, you remember the phrase, right?</p>
<p>Workers of the world unite.</p>
<p>Everybody who wasn&rsquo;t of the ruling class around the world</p>
<p>was part of the potential convert pool.</p>
<p>The Nazis are race-oriented.</p>
<p>To them, being part of the convert pool</p>
<p>had nothing to do with your ideology.</p>
<p>It had to do with your blood.</p>
<p>And so, I mean, this, the idea,</p>
<p>this is a problem Americans have with terminology,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why I use the People&rsquo;s Republic,</p>
<p>the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of North Korea to start with.</p>
<p>You got to get past the national, you know,</p>
<p>socialist workers party name in the Nazi party.</p>
<p>I mean, the national socialist thing,</p>
<p>too many people buy that at face value.</p>
<p>If you took that out of the equation</p>
<p>and you just looked at the beliefs,</p>
<p>this is how you know so many people are just parroting</p>
<p>what they hear from, let&rsquo;s call them influencers,</p>
<p>rather than doing their own research,</p>
<p>because it really doesn&rsquo;t stand up to historical scrutiny.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to find a lot of historians</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ll back you up on the idea of the Nazis</p>
<p>as a left-wing group.</p>
<p>And as we said, if they&rsquo;re a left-wing group,</p>
<p>what the heck are they hanging out</p>
<p>with all these right-wing countries?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. It&rsquo;s just, yeah,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why it really makes no sense on every level.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m glad to chat with you about it</p>
<p>to sort of help clarify,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m sure there are a lot of very nice, sweet listeners</p>
<p>who have bought into it</p>
<p>because they have just heard it enough times.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I think laying down some actual facts,</p>
<p>you know, laying down some actual evidence in that regard</p>
<p>is very important, because otherwise this is a&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, go ahead, sir.</p>
<p>Well, I was just going to say,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s interesting to me, though,</p>
<p>to wrap this conversation up.</p>
<p>We started with the qui bono idea that,</p>
<p>you know, the who benefits, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be interested in who&rsquo;s angry</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re pushing this point of view, right?</p>
<p>And why are they angry?</p>
<p>So, I mean, to me,</p>
<p>arguing about where the Nazis stood on the political spectrum</p>
<p>is 75-year-old news.</p>
<p>Having somebody get angry at you today</p>
<p>because of where you say the Nazis are</p>
<p>on the political spectrum is much more interesting to me.</p>
<p>That gets deep into the psyche</p>
<p>of not just American politics right now,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s call it politics in the entire Western world.</p>
<p>Well, and that reminds me, this is actually funny,</p>
<p>because you got into it as well.</p>
<p>I remember a few months ago,</p>
<p>I tweeted this image that I found scaringly chilling,</p>
<p>where there was this image of these guards at Auschwitz</p>
<p>having a picnic and all laughing all happily.</p>
<p>And so you see these people,</p>
<p>and they all seem like sweet, nice, young German people.</p>
<p>And then you remember that they are the guards at Auschwitz.</p>
<p>So, you know, the ultimate image</p>
<p>to display the banality of evil.</p>
<p>Now, you would figure that that would be</p>
<p>a relatively uncontroversial thing,</p>
<p>in the sense that we understand that, yeah,</p>
<p>ordinary people do horrible stuff.</p>
<p>We understand that, yes, the Nazis did horrible things.</p>
<p>Clear enough, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about 1945.</p>
<p>And suddenly there was a whole storm of angry people</p>
<p>about, why aren&rsquo;t you showing the communist guards</p>
<p>if you show these?</p>
<p>Why aren&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>And it was just like, whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>Where does this even come from?</p>
<p>And, you know, and it was clearly an effort of,</p>
<p>you know, we need to score a point for our team kind of thing,</p>
<p>even though if you ask them, nobody would say,</p>
<p>no, I&rsquo;m defending the Nazis.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s kind of where he was.</p>
<p>He was still framed in a left wing, right wing fashion.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s weird because, I mean, I get the feeling</p>
<p>that your hiatus from common sense</p>
<p>has a bit to do with the modern political situation</p>
<p>where if you say that the sun is out,</p>
<p>immediately you&rsquo;re going to have people</p>
<p>from all sorts of sides yelling at you</p>
<p>that, how dare you say that the sun is out?</p>
<p>The sun is not out.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>And that there&rsquo;s such a degree of factionalism</p>
<p>in modern politics that you cannot say even</p>
<p>the most obvious thing, the stuff that&rsquo;s like saying two</p>
<p>and two equal four.</p>
<p>You can barely say that without it</p>
<p>being perceived as either promoting one camp or another,</p>
<p>which automatically means that 50% of the people</p>
<p>are going to hate your guts.</p>
<p>Well, let me even take it one step farther</p>
<p>in the contradiction.</p>
<p>If the people that said that to you really</p>
<p>believe the Nazis are a left wing movement,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re coming at this from a right wing point of view,</p>
<p>why on earth would they care, right?</p>
<p>Theoretically, you&rsquo;re just making their point for them,</p>
<p>right? The Nazis are evil.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Those left wing Nazis are evil.</p>
<p>But those are people who think the Nazis are on the left</p>
<p>but get mad when you&rsquo;re not giving equal time</p>
<p>to the crimes of the Bolsheviks.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t make sense right there.</p>
<p>So if you say, why did Dan give up his current event</p>
<p>show temporarily, maybe, it&rsquo;s because how do you even</p>
<p>deal with such basic contradictions</p>
<p>that the people who are making them don&rsquo;t see?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to have a conversation with people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t recognize such a basic contradiction.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the problem, that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard to even have a public discourse.</p>
<p>And I mean, social media doesn&rsquo;t help because, of course,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not sitting in front of somebody</p>
<p>where you can pick up body language and other things</p>
<p>that are more likely to make you less aggressive.</p>
<p>But still, the point being, we hear this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to have any kind of conversation</p>
<p>when immediately people start yelling at each other</p>
<p>and are just looking for a reason</p>
<p>to score a point for their team.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t even apply to politics, almost.</p>
<p>It seems to apply like any topic seems good enough</p>
<p>to start a fight about.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure if this is a result of alienation of people</p>
<p>not seeing each other face to face.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what it is a result of.</p>
<p>And I would be curious to hear your opinion.</p>
<p>But I definitely see it.</p>
<p>And I can see why doing a show like Common Sense</p>
<p>may not seem like the happiest prospect in the world for you</p>
<p>when anything you&rsquo;re going to say,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get yelled at.</p>
<p>Well, you know, it is interesting to me</p>
<p>that in these particular times that we live in,</p>
<p>to be someone who tries to see both sides</p>
<p>is seen by both sides as somehow validating or enabling</p>
<p>evil on the other side, right?</p>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t 100% condemning the other side,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re part of the problem.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s not the world I inhabit, right?</p>
<p>We started that program as a way to find things</p>
<p>that we had in common so that we could solve common problems</p>
<p>that both the right and the left would agree upon,</p>
<p>things like a need for government corruption reform,</p>
<p>stuff like that.</p>
<p>I will say, though, let me push back a little on this idea</p>
<p>about division or the anger or the lack of ability</p>
<p>to have a civil conversation.</p>
<p>Because at least in the United States,</p>
<p>I think we have a long history of that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there was some golden age where</p>
<p>we could have these wonderful, calm discussions</p>
<p>about politics.</p>
<p>People always would get, I mean, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a reason that they say there&rsquo;s a few things you shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>discuss at dinner, religion, sex, politics.</p>
<p>So I mean, I think people have always</p>
<p>gotten worked up over that.</p>
<p>But if you go back and you look at the kind of arguments,</p>
<p>and once again, the average folks</p>
<p>in the middle of the country weren&rsquo;t writing</p>
<p>long intelligentsia sort of college-type treaties on this,</p>
<p>but it does seem to my naked eye that the conversations were</p>
<p>held, one, on a higher plane so that you&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>discussing issues as opposed to the hyperbole and name</p>
<p>calling we do now.</p>
<p>I also think, and this is another topic too,</p>
<p>I think we miss having a common sense, a common framework</p>
<p>of reference.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call it truth while understanding that there never</p>
<p>was any truth.</p>
<p>But to be able to cite sources in an argument</p>
<p>used to be really valuable, whether or not</p>
<p>we really believe the sources.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I mean, the media is in such disarray.</p>
<p>The people who you used to rely on to provide at least</p>
<p>some window, even if it was a flawed window into reality,</p>
<p>are so disorganized, disoriented.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s let, I mean, totally, their reputations</p>
<p>are in tatters, that that leaves nothing to a conversation</p>
<p>but name calling and whatnot.</p>
<p>I mean, what facts would you argue with?</p>
<p>You have your facts and I have my facts,</p>
<p>and they never come, they never cross over, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, what was that Rudy Giuliani&rsquo;s line,</p>
<p>truth is not truth?</p>
<p>No, what is that he said?</p>
<p>Something along those lines.</p>
<p>That was like the most postmodernist statement</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever heard, where he was just,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s acknowledging the fact that, yes, there basically</p>
<p>is no agreement on objective truth,</p>
<p>that the death of investigative journalism,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what, you know, as many amazing things</p>
<p>as internet has brought, has also</p>
<p>brought the death of investigative journalism,</p>
<p>because, you know, nobody has the money</p>
<p>to spend to make it happen in an environment where people are</p>
<p>reading stuff online and they&rsquo;re not buying newspapers anymore</p>
<p>and all of that.</p>
<p>There is no commonly agreed set of facts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all, that&rsquo;s why people can, I mean,</p>
<p>people have always made up propaganda,</p>
<p>but there was a little bit of fact checking going on.</p>
<p>Now, I think anything you quote, automatically,</p>
<p>people are going to say, that&rsquo;s not a good source, screw it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to listen to it.</p>
<p>That just, nope, nope, nope.</p>
<p>I have my fingers in my ears.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a bad source.</p>
<p>Or at least you could quote somebody who you read, right?</p>
<p>You may say, I don&rsquo;t agree with what you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>because, you know, I was just reading this book by so and so,</p>
<p>and he said, I mean, the discussions</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t happen at that level.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s funny, because when I was in talk radio,</p>
<p>they used to say that you can&rsquo;t ever</p>
<p>delve any lower beneath the surface than the very surface</p>
<p>issues, because you have to assume your audience is</p>
<p>turning over all the time.</p>
<p>People are getting in and out of their cars and whatnot.</p>
<p>So you always have to keep the conversation</p>
<p>at the introductory level, because new people</p>
<p>are joining it all the time.</p>
<p>I almost feel like that&rsquo;s become the way</p>
<p>the national conversation and the international conversation</p>
<p>has gone now, where nothing gets below the surface level.</p>
<p>Because once you get below the surface level,</p>
<p>either people are incapable of having</p>
<p>a conversation at that level, or, I mean,</p>
<p>you know, if I come up with facts against somebody</p>
<p>and they say, well, you&rsquo;re just a fill-in-the-blank,</p>
<p>I mean, already the conversation is over.</p>
<p>So there isn&rsquo;t a conversation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And in a functioning, you know, there used to be a line</p>
<p>that in a democracy or a republic,</p>
<p>an informed citizenry is what&rsquo;s required.</p>
<p>Could you call our citizenry informed?</p>
<p>And if you said no, is it their fault?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>No, I agree.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s a really messy situation, which</p>
<p>is why I see the tremendous appeal, not just in US,</p>
<p>but around the world, of really kind of like the strong man</p>
<p>authoritarian type who&rsquo;s going to tell you,</p>
<p>I will take care of it all.</p>
<p>Because people are confused.</p>
<p>People are scared that there&rsquo;s so much contradictory</p>
<p>information, so much quick change happening</p>
<p>at an incredibly fast pace, that people</p>
<p>feel like the ground underneath them</p>
<p>is not as solid as it used to be.</p>
<p>And so the appeal of the strong man who&rsquo;s going to fix it all</p>
<p>seem to be very popular, pretty much,</p>
<p>or I wouldn&rsquo;t say all over the world,</p>
<p>but in many, many, many different parts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what, reading Mein Kampf again,</p>
<p>for the first time probably in two years, three years,</p>
<p>I read it for a show a while back.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m reading it, and it&rsquo;s funny,</p>
<p>because obviously the situations between post-First World War</p>
<p>Germany and where we are now is totally different.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not in a defeat period.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t had just the Great Depression,</p>
<p>all these other things.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re reading what Hitler is saying,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going, wow, a lot of this would apply to now in terms</p>
<p>of he&rsquo;s slamming the parliamentarians,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s talking about how they come out</p>
<p>to talk to the voters right around election time,</p>
<p>promise them everything.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the same sort of anger</p>
<p>that would play very well in the current society.</p>
<p>And I have to say, listen, I don&rsquo;t have a Nazi-istic bone,</p>
<p>or really a Bolshevistic bone in my body, but I get it.</p>
<p>I get the frustration when you see government slowly</p>
<p>but surely not functioning at all,</p>
<p>and certainly not functioning for the common people.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s funny is how often, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if you want to call it cyclical or whatever,</p>
<p>but how the very things that Hitler is saying in Mein Kampf,</p>
<p>specifically to appeal, let&rsquo;s remember</p>
<p>that that book was not to be this great historical document</p>
<p>so we could read it now.</p>
<p>It was meant for a political treatise</p>
<p>for himself in that era, how well that would play today.</p>
<p>I mean, I think people would be scared</p>
<p>if I said go read Mein Kampf to find out where Hitler</p>
<p>is on the political spectrum, because I</p>
<p>think they would think, don&rsquo;t tell people to do that,</p>
<p>because they might like it.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I think it has been done time and time again,</p>
<p>the whole quoting from Mein Kampf,</p>
<p>not saying that it&rsquo;s Hitler in front of cheering crowds who</p>
<p>go, this is great.</p>
<p>And then you tell them, by the way, that was Hitler,</p>
<p>and people flip out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a reason for it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s people, as much as it&rsquo;s not a very popular thing to say,</p>
<p>people like that stuff.</p>
<p>Oh, let me give you the converse one that upset me so much.</p>
<p>I remember I was on the radio in the 1990s.</p>
<p>I was always talking about freedom and liberty.</p>
<p>And this America that was disappearing.</p>
<p>And right around the time I was doing this,</p>
<p>I remember I was coming home from work,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m listening to the radio, and there was a story.</p>
<p>And it was some Democrats who had re- I&rsquo;m going from memory</p>
<p>here, but they had sort of rewritten</p>
<p>the Bill of Rights in modern day English,</p>
<p>so that it didn&rsquo;t look like the original.</p>
<p>And then submitted it, I forgot where this was.</p>
<p>I want to say it was the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>And a bunch of Republicans came forward</p>
<p>and said that it was awful, that it would destroy.</p>
<p>In other words, just going, really,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t have this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And then, of course, they sprung the trap on him</p>
<p>and said, oh, it&rsquo;s the Bill of Rights,</p>
<p>and you would have voted against it.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a little of that, too,</p>
<p>where you turn around and go, there&rsquo;s a lot of it.</p>
<p>And this is another reason that I</p>
<p>think my current event show has a problem right now,</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s hard for me to relate</p>
<p>to a current generation of Americans</p>
<p>that very well might look at the Bill of Rights</p>
<p>and say, way, way, way, I don&rsquo;t agree with 1, 4, 7.</p>
<p>I mean, I feel like a dinosaur politically.</p>
<p>And so having discussions with people along the lines</p>
<p>that we used to consider to be normal 20, 30 years ago,</p>
<p>elicits responses that surprise me,</p>
<p>and not just from young liberal Americans,</p>
<p>but from young conservative Americans, too.</p>
<p>It is one thing, though, that I&rsquo;m getting a lot when I bring</p>
<p>this up with people, is that I always</p>
<p>get the feedback of, don&rsquo;t listen to those people.</p>
<p>Just go ahead, and this applies probably to you</p>
<p>more than to me.</p>
<p>But many people miss your point of view.</p>
<p>Many people miss the presence of a voice that&rsquo;s not ultra,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t push this ultra-factionalism all</p>
<p>the time, a voice that&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>trying to make sense out of the current scenario,</p>
<p>not through particular ideological lenses.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a pain, because inevitably, if you do that,</p>
<p>you will get the hatred from multiple sides.</p>
<p>But at the same time, there probably</p>
<p>is a need for it, precisely because the times are</p>
<p>so ugly in that sense.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it&rsquo;s very easy.</p>
<p>This is a secret Daniele Bolelli attempt</p>
<p>to try to find the chink in my armor</p>
<p>to get me to go do that again.</p>
<p>I know what you&rsquo;re up to, Daniele.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, no, and you know it well, and we agree.</p>
<p>But also, let&rsquo;s look at what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy for me to tell you to do it, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, Dan, this is a really important thing</p>
<p>that somebody should do it, wink, wink.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you do it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, yes, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Except that that means you have to deal</p>
<p>with all the annoying aspects that would that entail.</p>
<p>So as much as I&rsquo;m pushing you in that direction,</p>
<p>I also acknowledge that I&rsquo;m not the best of friends in this,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m telling you to do something that I&rsquo;m not doing.</p>
<p>So, you know, not.</p>
<p>Well, speaking of that, let me shift this a little bit.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, I don&rsquo;t like it already.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m going to shift this, because we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>spoken of this specific American milieu here,</p>
<p>which is where I live, right?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean live like geographically.</p>
<p>I mean, I am a product of this, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very American point of view</p>
<p>and a very American attitude.</p>
<p>And I realize my blind spots and my blinders.</p>
<p>And when I talk about, you know, the National Socialism</p>
<p>and people talking about all of these</p>
<p>are such American phenomenon, but the United States</p>
<p>is, of course, but one part of the planet.</p>
<p>Let me ask you, you go home to the old country a lot.</p>
<p>How does how does how do these trends that we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>here in the States, how much is this internationalized?</p>
<p>And tell me, what do you think?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about European youth in general,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s talk about maybe Mediterranean youth</p>
<p>or Italian youth specifically, if you have any connection</p>
<p>to them at all.</p>
<p>How much of this is is apparent?</p>
<p>How much do the situations match?</p>
<p>And in what ways do you see differences?</p>
<p>I mean, other than the discussion about Nazism,</p>
<p>fascism, left wing, right wing, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>And I mean that in the sense that we have established</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s based on no historical evidence whatsoever.</p>
<p>That stuff, probably because people have lived through it,</p>
<p>is not really up for discussion in Italy.</p>
<p>But everything else applies.</p>
<p>You know, everything else is the same degree</p>
<p>of extreme, brutal, angry factionalism.</p>
<p>The same lack of solution from one side</p>
<p>that then push people into voting the other side,</p>
<p>only to find out that the other side is equally clueless.</p>
<p>So then you swim back to&hellip;</p>
<p>I think these are, I don&rsquo;t want to say universal trends,</p>
<p>because what do I know about every country in the world?</p>
<p>But if we stick the discussion to at least Italy,</p>
<p>yeah, I do see the same dynamics at play.</p>
<p>OK, can we call this a, you know, for every action</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an equal and opposite reaction.</p>
<p>Could we suggest that this is a natural attitude,</p>
<p>you know, populism being the response to a government</p>
<p>that is deaf or that is working for someone else?</p>
<p>I mean, another one of the reports came out again,</p>
<p>you know, backing up what everybody already knows,</p>
<p>which is the people that influence policy,</p>
<p>at least in the United States, are people with tons of money.</p>
<p>And the people that have almost no say over policy</p>
<p>are the great mass of people.</p>
<p>How much, you know, I would say that in my mind,</p>
<p>populism, whether you want to say populism of the left</p>
<p>or the right or wherever, is a natural reaction, perhaps,</p>
<p>to a government that is deaf or unresponsive</p>
<p>or seemingly working for someone else.</p>
<p>And I think you could say in the global sense,</p>
<p>I mean, look at the reaction to the EU in Europe</p>
<p>and some of the critiques against it sound an awful lot</p>
<p>like critiques against Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>by Americans here.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think that&rsquo;s the problem that, you know,</p>
<p>our, the human mind is very binary.</p>
<p>You know, we are used to good and evil,</p>
<p>black and white, if this or that.</p>
<p>Not realizing that often the solution</p>
<p>is a mix of different impulses,</p>
<p>is not a one extreme or another,</p>
<p>which doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s in the center either,</p>
<p>because the center is also a stack position.</p>
<p>The solution is dynamic, it&rsquo;s constantly changing.</p>
<p>And you have to find the right balance</p>
<p>in the right situation.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s not the way our minds work.</p>
<p>Most people feel if a faction A is doing something</p>
<p>that clearly is not working,</p>
<p>if the government is not working following this philosophy,</p>
<p>then faction B will be the solution.</p>
<p>If the powers that be in Washington are screwed up,</p>
<p>then some populists to show up will be the solution</p>
<p>or vice versa.</p>
<p>And what I see is just a ping pong game</p>
<p>between stupid ideas where, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the opposite of A is supposed to be B,</p>
<p>but B, yeah, they talk a different game,</p>
<p>but in terms of result is they are equally poor.</p>
<p>And rather than realizing, okay,</p>
<p>if A doesn&rsquo;t deliver results,</p>
<p>if B doesn&rsquo;t deliver results,</p>
<p>maybe we could try something else.</p>
<p>I just see the ping pong game going back and forth forever.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just like, really, this is the game we&rsquo;re stuck on?</p>
<p>This is like, do we really not think</p>
<p>that there may be more out there</p>
<p>than just these two supposedly different alternatives,</p>
<p>except that they deliver similarly bad results?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the part that I find frustrating,</p>
<p>that I find is not even about modern U.S.</p>
<p>or modern Italy,</p>
<p>or even the left-right political spectrum.</p>
<p>I find that like a virus of the human mind,</p>
<p>that we think in these binary opposites</p>
<p>that very rarely actually match reality.</p>
<p>Let me propose another idea.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a wonderful punk rock singer, John Lydon.</p>
<p>He used to be called Johnny Rotten.</p>
<p>He wrote a wonderful book, and the title is wonderful,</p>
<p>called Anger is an Energy.</p>
<p>And I would propose that,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m speaking for the United States here specifically,</p>
<p>I would suggest that most Americans in normal times</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t care that much about politics.</p>
<p>But when it&rsquo;s apparent that life is getting difficult</p>
<p>and that the situation appears to be extremely unfair,</p>
<p>that the anger rises,</p>
<p>and all of a sudden,</p>
<p>people who are not normally interested in politics</p>
<p>are interested because it affects them.</p>
<p>So, for example, I&rsquo;ve said forever</p>
<p>that if the United States can&rsquo;t figure out a way</p>
<p>to do better for poor people and lower middle-class people,</p>
<p>that those people will make the rest of us</p>
<p>feel their pain eventually, right?</p>
<p>They will only put up with it for a certain period of time.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a tipping point.</p>
<p>If there get to be too many of those people,</p>
<p>no matter how much you want to justify,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just parroting a line here, right?</p>
<p>The United States is this great capitalist system</p>
<p>where, you know, if you&rsquo;ve got what it takes,</p>
<p>you will make it, and if you don&rsquo;t, you won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That sounds great on paper,</p>
<p>but if enough people fall into the</p>
<p>we-don&rsquo;t-make-it category,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to decide that that system&rsquo;s unsustainable,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to change it whether or not on paper</p>
<p>this is the right philosophical system.</p>
<p>That, to me, is where you get populism,</p>
<p>where people are just saying,</p>
<p>the system as constructed is not working.</p>
<p>There are people who are doing very well,</p>
<p>and then they convert doing very well</p>
<p>into influencing the government with their cash,</p>
<p>which, you know, even doubles down on the situation.</p>
<p>It makes it worse.</p>
<p>Eventually, you get populist anger on all sides.</p>
<p>If those people could ever unite,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have a real interesting&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, that is a little bit where you wonder</p>
<p>if this isn&rsquo;t the shiny object being used</p>
<p>by our typical politicians</p>
<p>to keep us from uniting against them, right?</p>
<p>Fight against each other</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t notice what&rsquo;s going on behind the curtain.</p>
<p>But I think what you may see now globally is,</p>
<p>if you get enough people that can&rsquo;t feed their kids</p>
<p>or can&rsquo;t afford any health care and they&rsquo;re sick,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s enough of them,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not going to put up with it.</p>
<p>I mean, history shows</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not going to put up with it forever.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know why we should be surprised when they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And as everybody knows,</p>
<p>you have two choices when they flip out.</p>
<p>Either you get into some radical changes</p>
<p>or you crack down on them,</p>
<p>which leads to a more repressive state,</p>
<p>which nobody in this country wants.</p>
<p>Absolutely. And I think that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>I think you really hit the nail on the head on that one,</p>
<p>because as much as I&rsquo;m not a big believer</p>
<p>in conspiracy theories,</p>
<p>and I tend to think that those usually are based</p>
<p>on very lazy thinking,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t help to think</p>
<p>that when there are real major issues at play</p>
<p>that are ever discussed,</p>
<p>where the spotlight is hardly ever shown there,</p>
<p>where the real business is happening closed doors,</p>
<p>and in the meantime,</p>
<p>they have you fighting about transgender bathrooms</p>
<p>or something that I don&rsquo;t mean to trivialize,</p>
<p>but really in terms of the great scheme of things,</p>
<p>not quite as big of an issue as, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>where we are going today in terms of the sustainability</p>
<p>of our relationship with the planet,</p>
<p>of sources of energy, of, you know,</p>
<p>10,000 other things that are at the key</p>
<p>of whether the human race has a future or not.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but think that there may be an element</p>
<p>of destruction at play there.</p>
<p>That is like, yeah, get them to fight along ideological lines</p>
<p>about completely irrelevant topics to the real business,</p>
<p>not irrelevant to any single individual life.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s relevant to some individual life,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m talking irrelevant in terms of</p>
<p>what the real business is about,</p>
<p>what the big decisions got to be made of,</p>
<p>and that way we still get to do business as usual</p>
<p>behind closed doors while the idiots are fighting each other</p>
<p>over something else.</p>
<p>Oh, we are very manipulatable,</p>
<p>and this isn&rsquo;t a conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>This is how politics work.</p>
<p>So, I mean, you can&rsquo;t call that conspiracies</p>
<p>when the political systems understood</p>
<p>how to do this forever.</p>
<p>I mean, a perfect example is,</p>
<p>I used to interview politicians all the time on the radio,</p>
<p>and some of them became good friends of mine,</p>
<p>and they were very upfront about how things work.</p>
<p>I mean, for example, they would talk about</p>
<p>the problem of fundraising</p>
<p>when you would get between elections.</p>
<p>So, when you would get to this dead zone</p>
<p>that was quite a distance between,</p>
<p>maybe call it an equal distance between two elections,</p>
<p>and it was hard to raise funds,</p>
<p>they would go and agree, the Republicans and the Democrats,</p>
<p>to bring up a bill affecting one of those issues</p>
<p>that just gets money pouring into the coffers on both sides.</p>
<p>Abortion or guns or whatever.</p>
<p>This was a bipartisan effort to fan and whip up the base</p>
<p>so that they started, you know,</p>
<p>so you had something to go back</p>
<p>and ask for contributions for.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a conspiracy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s politics.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So, I mean, if people get upset with that,</p>
<p>I understand the populist anger,</p>
<p>because, you know, as problems</p>
<p>that we all see around us get worse,</p>
<p>you become more and more frustrated</p>
<p>with the lack of attention to them.</p>
<p>Now, this kind of leads into another subject</p>
<p>you wanted to talk about.</p>
<p>You wanted to talk about, if not these political leaders, who?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll let you set that up.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was playing with the Dan Carlin time machine concept.</p>
<p>And so if you had to pick one past U.S. president,</p>
<p>which, of course, is crazy, because one past U.S. president</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have the knowledge of the modern world that we have.</p>
<p>But in a more, you know, let&rsquo;s say you give them a few years</p>
<p>to catch up to what&rsquo;s going on today,</p>
<p>personality-wise, if there was one past U.S. president</p>
<p>that you wouldn&rsquo;t mind seeing in the White House today,</p>
<p>is there anybody?</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s anybody, who would that be?</p>
<p>Well, you sort of screwed up my answer, too,</p>
<p>because you issued the disclaimer</p>
<p>that I was going to throw out initially, which is,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you could bring back any 19th century presidents</p>
<p>and bring them up to speed with the America of today</p>
<p>so that they could operate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because I know you too well,</p>
<p>and I closed the way out of the question.</p>
<p>I was like, I know where he&rsquo;s going to go,</p>
<p>so let me close that door right away.</p>
<p>It limits the choices, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s funny, because this is a question</p>
<p>that gets to one&rsquo;s own political beliefs,</p>
<p>because, obviously, I&rsquo;m going to pick the president</p>
<p>that solves the things that I believe are problems,</p>
<p>which may not be what other people believe are problems.</p>
<p>I thought about this a little bit.</p>
<p>To me, I think I got to bring back somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s going to figure out how to give the United States</p>
<p>a soft landing from where we are now.</p>
<p>And there are going to be people that don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>we need a soft landing or any kind of landing.</p>
<p>But what I mean by that is, if you look,</p>
<p>and this is, again, my personal opinion,</p>
<p>if you look at where the United States is now,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call it what it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an empire.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just an empire.</p>
<p>I always blow people&rsquo;s minds when I point this out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most powerful empire in global history, OK?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not even close.</p>
<p>So when you say that, you know, Americans</p>
<p>are so conditioned to believe that they&rsquo;re not an empire,</p>
<p>that that simply strikes them incorrectly.</p>
<p>It feels like you&rsquo;re making a political statement</p>
<p>by even saying that, right?</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re not like Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not like the Mongols.</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re a commercial empire.</p>
<p>Think Athens, right, or something like that.</p>
<p>Think Carthage.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re like.</p>
<p>And we exert a very light touch with client states</p>
<p>and friendly states and alliance systems.</p>
<p>We have a navy that controls the seas,</p>
<p>protects the trade routes, all these kind of things.</p>
<p>But that, to me, is unsustainable, right?</p>
<p>Whatever it is, 600, 800 bases, whatever</p>
<p>it is around the world.</p>
<p>I mean, if that&rsquo;s not an empire, I don&rsquo;t know what is.</p>
<p>So I always say to people, well, how do you think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to turn out long term, right?</p>
<p>In other words, project 100 years from now.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the American empire?</p>
<p>Project 200 years from now.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not there 200 years from now, what happened to it,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>My attitude is that this is unsustainable.</p>
<p>But I think the people in the United States government</p>
<p>and the halls of power and many Americans</p>
<p>assume that the conditions we have now,</p>
<p>US global dominance, or the word we&rsquo;d like to use</p>
<p>is global leadership, that this is ever present and unending.</p>
<p>That this is the status quo for the rest of history</p>
<p>moving forward, which is ridiculous.</p>
<p>And as we all understand from, what was it,</p>
<p>foreign policy 101, the balance of power principles,</p>
<p>it naturally, when you have one overriding power,</p>
<p>it naturally creates an interest for other global powers</p>
<p>to coalesce, to counterbalance it,</p>
<p>which leads to either terrible wars eventually,</p>
<p>or eventually some country bankrupting itself,</p>
<p>trying to keep the status quo.</p>
<p>So when you ask me which president I would bring back,</p>
<p>I would bring back somebody who both recognized that</p>
<p>and would be in a position to do something about it.</p>
<p>And it would take a very special kind of person.</p>
<p>So I always go to Eisenhower.</p>
<p>Disclaimer, General slash President Eisenhower</p>
<p>did a lot of things that I think were awful</p>
<p>and that got the country into worse situations.</p>
<p>For example, he was a fervent user of, like, the CIA</p>
<p>to undermine countries and all these kind of things.</p>
<p>But I would suggest that that is part of the era he lived in</p>
<p>and certain challenges from that 1950s war against communism</p>
<p>that I would give him a little bit of a pass on.</p>
<p>What I would say about Eisenhower, though,</p>
<p>and why I would choose him over those 19th century guys</p>
<p>is he&rsquo;s a guy who straddled the divide.</p>
<p>He was born in one America, and he was president</p>
<p>of another America, and he remembered</p>
<p>what the old America was like, right?</p>
<p>What I always get angry at, when Americans will talk to me</p>
<p>about my political beliefs on the empire thing,</p>
<p>they will always say to me, well, you&rsquo;re an isolationist.</p>
<p>And I will say, I&rsquo;m not an isolationist.</p>
<p>I wanted the American foreign policy</p>
<p>that existed from the beginning of the country</p>
<p>to about the Second World War.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s isolationist, I&rsquo;m sure the Mexicans</p>
<p>and the Native Americans and the Canadians</p>
<p>and a bunch of other people would go,</p>
<p>oh, it doesn&rsquo;t seem very isolationist to me.</p>
<p>But my point is that Eisenhower was born in a Norman Rockwell</p>
<p>upbringing and understood that that&rsquo;s the America</p>
<p>that if we could get back to that, we should.</p>
<p>And when you look at his comments,</p>
<p>he understood totally that it was</p>
<p>an unsustainable and temporary situation</p>
<p>that we were in in the post-Second World War world,</p>
<p>and he was looking for ways out, right?</p>
<p>When can we get out of Europe and let the Europeans resume,</p>
<p>you know, their normal operations</p>
<p>and they control their area and they defend their area?</p>
<p>He was looking for landing zones, right?</p>
<p>How do we get out of these commitments</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s safe, right?</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t want to leave anybody in the lurch.</p>
<p>He realized that, you know, you had to be careful.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s why he gave that military industrial complex</p>
<p>speech at the end of his presidency,</p>
<p>because he realized that this is not sustainable,</p>
<p>nor is it healthy long term.</p>
<p>But it is profitable for some people.</p>
<p>So you have to be careful because eventually</p>
<p>that profitability for some people becomes addictive.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s funny that so many of the people</p>
<p>that decry U.S. social programs don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>that the number one transfer of wealth that I can think of,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re talking about the discretionary part</p>
<p>of the U.S. budget, is from the American taxpayer</p>
<p>to a bunch of companies that make military hardware.</p>
<p>I mean, that is military Keynesianism right there.</p>
<p>So when you ask what president I would get,</p>
<p>you need a president that can, one, see the unsustainability.</p>
<p>I think Eisenhower pointed that out</p>
<p>when it was a lot less bad than it is now, by the way.</p>
<p>I also think he understood what America really was</p>
<p>because he grew up in it.</p>
<p>So in his mind&rsquo;s eye, he would like to, as much as you can,</p>
<p>you know, given the realities of the 20th century,</p>
<p>get back to that.</p>
<p>And he remembers what the road back looked like.</p>
<p>Finally, I think the fact that the guy was a general</p>
<p>makes a huge difference because in our country,</p>
<p>it is so easy to tar and feather a civilian</p>
<p>when they start talking about changing, you know,</p>
<p>the global military balance of power and all this,</p>
<p>whereas Eisenhower knew all those generals,</p>
<p>Air Force guys, and admirals by name, personally.</p>
<p>He played bridge with them, right?</p>
<p>He did not fear them.</p>
<p>He could go right up to them and say, you know,</p>
<p>Bob, this is ridiculous.</p>
<p>The country can&rsquo;t afford it or whatever.</p>
<p>And no American person is going to think</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s soft on defense.</p>
<p>So when you talk about what Dan Carlin thinks</p>
<p>the country should have to get back on an even keel,</p>
<p>this is my own personal, you know, bias,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to take in my mind a guy like Eisenhower</p>
<p>is going to be required to do it.</p>
<p>Now, did he do a lot of things I don&rsquo;t like?</p>
<p>He absolutely did.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t have any presidents who are perfect.</p>
<p>Were there 19th century guys I would like?</p>
<p>Sure, but they&rsquo;re not going to be able to.</p>
<p>I mean, if you put them in the White House,</p>
<p>even if you tried to bring them up to speed,</p>
<p>the country that they&rsquo;re going to be dealing with</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even resemble the one that they came from.</p>
<p>So to me, it&rsquo;s got to be somebody who at least existed</p>
<p>in a time where the country had some semblance</p>
<p>of what it&rsquo;s like now in order to adequately,</p>
<p>you know, contend with the problem.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m picking Eisenhower.</p>
<p>Do you have a person you would pick?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, as you said, there are no perfect guys.</p>
<p>And in some cases, we are really just looking</p>
<p>at very different degrees of imperfection</p>
<p>because some of their downsides are very heavy.</p>
<p>But one guy I like, I can&rsquo;t tell both in personality,</p>
<p>probably because he&rsquo;s a little mentally deranged,</p>
<p>which seems to be one of the characteristics</p>
<p>I resonate well with.</p>
<p>But I did this three-part series on Theodore Roosevelt.</p>
<p>And as much, okay, let&rsquo;s start with the negatives.</p>
<p>Roosevelt never swore a war he didn&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>He was ridiculously impulsive,</p>
<p>very hawkish in terms of foreign policy,</p>
<p>all stuff that I&rsquo;m not particularly fond of.</p>
<p>So what is that I like about the,</p>
<p>and just to clarify again, Theodore Roosevelt,</p>
<p>very different from Franklin Delano Roosevelt,</p>
<p>so just as a reminder.</p>
<p>But Theodore Roosevelt, one of the things that I dig</p>
<p>is two concepts.</p>
<p>One, his environmental policies, I thought they were awesome.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s the one guy that I&rsquo;ve ever seen</p>
<p>who pushed the best environmental policies</p>
<p>in terms of a president.</p>
<p>And I think that to me is something</p>
<p>that should be a bipartisan issue,</p>
<p>should be something that everybody goes behind</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t matter where you fit ideologically</p>
<p>if you have poison in your water or in the air you breathe.</p>
<p>So somebody who made that a priority is important to me.</p>
<p>And also, I really like his willingness</p>
<p>to challenge the corruption in both parties.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s, to this day,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the best third-party effort ever in modern times.</p>
<p>He was very open about going hard against the people</p>
<p>in his party as well as people in other parties.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a quote of his that I really love that,</p>
<p>and granted, you know, quotes are easy to,</p>
<p>stuff is easy to say.</p>
<p>Every politician can deliver a good speech</p>
<p>and then not follow up.</p>
<p>But in terms of the way he did follow up</p>
<p>on some of these issues, something I like.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s this quote where he goes,</p>
<p>political parties exist to secure responsible government</p>
<p>and to execute the will of the people.</p>
<p>From these great tasks,</p>
<p>both of the old parties have turned aside.</p>
<p>Instead of instruments to promote the general welfare,</p>
<p>they have become the tools of corrupt interests</p>
<p>which use them impartially to serve their selfish purposes.</p>
<p>Behind ostensible government,</p>
<p>sits enthroned an invisible government</p>
<p>who in no allegiance</p>
<p>and acknowledging no responsibility to the people.</p>
<p>To destroy this invisible government,</p>
<p>to dissolve the unholy alliance</p>
<p>between corrupt business and corrupt politics</p>
<p>is the first task of the statemanship of the day.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t disagree with a comma in there.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like everything is dead on.</p>
<p>And I found that his actions</p>
<p>in terms of cracking down on corruption</p>
<p>were particularly needed.</p>
<p>So when you put those two together, you know,</p>
<p>his environmental policies and his attitude</p>
<p>in terms of factionalism slash corruption,</p>
<p>those are characteristics that I think</p>
<p>are extremely important to this day.</p>
<p>You know, I always was fascinated with the,</p>
<p>you know, if you talk about like life lessons,</p>
<p>it would have been interesting had Roosevelt gone through,</p>
<p>in my opinion, I mean, one of the things</p>
<p>I find interesting about the guy is he&rsquo;s a very,</p>
<p>for those who don&rsquo;t remember or know,</p>
<p>Roosevelt was, and I always called him an adrenaline junkie.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I always think about Teddy Roosevelt in terms of how,</p>
<p>what kind of a president he would have been</p>
<p>more at the end of his life than when he actually was.</p>
<p>Because when he was president,</p>
<p>in some ways he reminded me of my grandfather,</p>
<p>who I always thought was like Batman.</p>
<p>And Teddy Roosevelt always wanted to be like Batman.</p>
<p>And when I was a kid, I loved Teddy Roosevelt</p>
<p>because he was like a big kid who played with toy soldiers</p>
<p>and thought all that was, I mean, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, to me, that&rsquo;s, I liked that as a president,</p>
<p>but as I got older, I thought, okay,</p>
<p>this is a dangerous guy who thinks war</p>
<p>is wonderful and heroic and grand.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing, you know, he goes through it.</p>
<p>And by the way, his experience, as we all know,</p>
<p>when he was fighting in the Spanish-American war,</p>
<p>in his mind was glorious and grand,</p>
<p>and he had a great time and it was wonderful.</p>
<p>You know, war was a game then.</p>
<p>But then you get to the First World War,</p>
<p>which he actively wanted to get into,</p>
<p>and he loses kids, right?</p>
<p>His kids die in the war.</p>
<p>And it changed him, you know?</p>
<p>I mean, and that is, the Roosevelt that happens</p>
<p>after that happens might have been, in my mind,</p>
<p>a more well-rounded figure than the guy</p>
<p>who was actually in the White House.</p>
<p>So in that sense, I think in a weird way,</p>
<p>and it sounds like disrespectful to say so,</p>
<p>but I mean, I feel like the guy grew up</p>
<p>in a way that would have made him, like you said,</p>
<p>I mean, a president who fights corruption,</p>
<p>and he was known as the trust buster.</p>
<p>I mean, he would have gone in and taken on</p>
<p>some of the big corporations today,</p>
<p>which, you know, what I always argue,</p>
<p>by the way, this is an aside,</p>
<p>but what I always argue to these Americans</p>
<p>who want a tiny, tiny, tiny little government</p>
<p>is then who&rsquo;s gonna protect us against</p>
<p>the giant, giant, giant corporations, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a balance there.</p>
<p>And Teddy Roosevelt understood</p>
<p>that the government needs to be like a fire,</p>
<p>which is what an early American writer once said,</p>
<p>President once said the government is like fire,</p>
<p>that, you know, if you don&rsquo;t have it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re freezed to death, but if it gets out of control,</p>
<p>it burns everything around it.</p>
<p>But what that means is it needs to be tended</p>
<p>at just the right level.</p>
<p>Just the right level is one that could protect the people</p>
<p>from something like a giant international corporation</p>
<p>that runs roughshod over our rights and freedoms,</p>
<p>but not so large that it runs roughshod</p>
<p>over our rights and freedoms.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I get it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that both you and I</p>
<p>picked Republican presidents, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, even the definition of,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why, you know, Democrat, Republican to me is like,</p>
<p>especially when you go far back in time, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why eventually Roosevelt didn&rsquo;t fit in with anybody.</p>
<p>You know, he didn&rsquo;t fit in with the Republican Party.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t fit in with the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>He was his own thing because he upset them all.</p>
<p>You know, he did things that the powers that be</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t like in any direction.</p>
<p>And in some way, ideologically,</p>
<p>he would be considered very right wing</p>
<p>and in some ways, ideologically,</p>
<p>he would be considered very left wing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another thing that I dig about him,</p>
<p>the fact that he didn&rsquo;t seem to be a slave to an ideology,</p>
<p>always going with the playbook of his party,</p>
<p>but very much making up his mind as he went,</p>
<p>not feeling the need to constantly fit in</p>
<p>with what&rsquo;s considered acceptable by his voters,</p>
<p>which I think was kind of what made him fun.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t know what he was going</p>
<p>to argue before he jumped in.</p>
<p>Well, and maybe we can put a wonderful bowtie</p>
<p>on the whole conversation here,</p>
<p>because you had mentioned that the, you know,</p>
<p>to talk about Democrats and Republicans</p>
<p>before the modern era is to talk about parties</p>
<p>that were so different that the comparisons</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even work anymore.</p>
<p>A perfect example of that is when I was looking</p>
<p>for Roosevelt, Franklin Delano Roosevelt speeches</p>
<p>for the latest Hardcore History Show,</p>
<p>I was listening to some of the campaign speeches</p>
<p>of that era.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about the 1940 presidential campaign.</p>
<p>So Roosevelt&rsquo;s opponent was a guy named</p>
<p>Wendell Willkie, who was a businessman,</p>
<p>the Republican, and he&rsquo;s giving speeches.</p>
<p>And if you went and looked, and you can find them online</p>
<p>to his speech or his conversation to the camera,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it was an official speech.</p>
<p>It was more like a, what would you call it?</p>
<p>A filmed campaign commercial maybe</p>
<p>by the standards of that era.</p>
<p>You can see how much the United States</p>
<p>has moved to the right, totally.</p>
<p>Because if I played Willkie&rsquo;s speech today</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t identify what it was,</p>
<p>there is not a person who would hear it,</p>
<p>who would think that it was anything but a leftist speech.</p>
<p>But remember that this is the guy to the right</p>
<p>of the guy who&rsquo;s gonna crush him in the election, right?</p>
<p>So to me that, you know, we talked about Goldwater</p>
<p>being the real person who changed</p>
<p>the American conservative movement</p>
<p>from where it was to where it is,</p>
<p>which was a hard move to the right.</p>
<p>And then what Reagan did, who supposedly, you know,</p>
<p>Goldwater laid the foundation for Reagan,</p>
<p>who 15 or 14 years later, you know, comes to fruition.</p>
<p>Reagan moved the Democratic Party to the right.</p>
<p>Both parties are to the right of where they were in 1940,</p>
<p>which if you said to somebody who wants to make America great,</p>
<p>were we great in 1940, they would probably say,</p>
<p>well, greater than we are today.</p>
<p>Go look at the campaign speeches from both the Democratic</p>
<p>and Republican presidential hopefuls in 1940</p>
<p>and see if you could agree with either one of those</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re on the conservative side of things now.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s one of the funniest things</p>
<p>about looking at it historically and not just being</p>
<p>stuck in the present, that, yeah, you do see these changes</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t help but smile at it.</p>
<p>Because, yes, that would be a shock to a lot of people.</p>
<p>Well, and listen, as you know, I&rsquo;m not saying</p>
<p>that this is right or wrong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m simply, this is not fake news.</p>
<p>I mean, people can go check this out for themselves.</p>
<p>You may say, thank goodness the United States and the world</p>
<p>has moved to the right politically.</p>
<p>Or you may say it&rsquo;s a tragedy.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s fascinating that we have and that things,</p>
<p>I mean, the Republican presidential hopeful in 1940</p>
<p>is talking about expanding social programs that today</p>
<p>people on the right side of the ledger</p>
<p>want to get rid of totally.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, again, you know, when we talk about going back</p>
<p>to another America, I don&rsquo;t think people understand</p>
<p>what the other America was.</p>
<p>And this is why I have such a hard time doing</p>
<p>my current events show now, because that was always</p>
<p>what I was suggesting, that we need to get back</p>
<p>to some of the foundational ideas that when I was a kid,</p>
<p>nobody would have argued with.</p>
<p>You might have argued over if I said</p>
<p>we need to get more liberty because we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been reducing our personal freedom and all that.</p>
<p>A lot of people would say, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But then when you get down to the specifics,</p>
<p>might argue with, oh, I don&rsquo;t mean that, or I don&rsquo;t mean this.</p>
<p>But today, when I say things like that,</p>
<p>I get pushback from young people on both sides</p>
<p>of the political spectrum.</p>
<p>In other words, I, as an old fashioned American,</p>
<p>am so out of touch with today&rsquo;s political world</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not like that.</p>
<p>So I have a hard time.</p>
<p>I mean, in the old days, you used</p>
<p>to be able to base an argument on certain fundamental truths</p>
<p>that everyone agreed with.</p>
<p>And now no one agrees with those truths.</p>
<p>So even something like liberty, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a bad word in some circles now.</p>
<p>And when you use it in the circles that use it</p>
<p>and like it, they don&rsquo;t mean it the way I mean it.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s one of the things that I&rsquo;ve always noticed,</p>
<p>like when I argue with some people who are pushing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all about freedom, freedom, freedom.</p>
<p>Like, I get it. I like freedom.</p>
<p>Freedom is a cool thing.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m assuming you are in favor of ending the war on drugs,</p>
<p>legalizing prostitution, and legalizing euthanasia.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, no, no, no, no, that&rsquo;s not what I meant.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, OK, then probably we should have a dictionary talk</p>
<p>first about what you mean when you say things like freedom.</p>
<p>Because to me, that&rsquo;s individual rights.</p>
<p>You know, you have the right to put</p>
<p>whatever you want in your body as long as you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>affecting somebody else.</p>
<p>If people want to sell sex, as long as nobody&rsquo;s being forced,</p>
<p>they have the right to do so.</p>
<p>And they have the right to die as they wish.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not even saying that&rsquo;s a good or a bad thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying, if you are going to scream freedom,</p>
<p>probably that would be a consistent way to go about it.</p>
<p>But often, as you say, what people mean by certain words</p>
<p>is not really the same meaning that everybody see.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think certain words are poison.</p>
<p>Like, we should, the less we use them,</p>
<p>the better, because they are so hopelessly vague that everybody</p>
<p>project their own meanings on it.</p>
<p>You know, when&rsquo;s the last time you</p>
<p>heard a candidate anywhere saying</p>
<p>that they are against freedom?</p>
<p>That, yeah, we hate freedom and we need to squash freedom.</p>
<p>Or when is it that we are, you know,</p>
<p>terms even like left wing, right wing, as we started with,</p>
<p>are so vague.</p>
<p>Terms like socialism, communism, they</p>
<p>are all things that are like, you</p>
<p>can have a discussion going on for hours with somebody,</p>
<p>never realizing that you are not talking</p>
<p>about the same thing in the first place</p>
<p>because you assign different meanings to those concepts.</p>
<p>And I think this is amplified on social media, where you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the time to go, hey, wait, stop a second.</p>
<p>What did you mean by that?</p>
<p>And so this discussion go on forever,</p>
<p>where really there&rsquo;s not even an agreement about what</p>
<p>it is they are talking about, except that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>using the same word.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s like what we had said when</p>
<p>I said that there was that translation of the Bill</p>
<p>of Rights into common language and people were against it.</p>
<p>There was a famous quote.</p>
<p>I forgot who said it, but it was years ago.</p>
<p>So it shows you how little, in some ways, things have changed.</p>
<p>Where I think it was a political figure,</p>
<p>it may not have been, who said the Bill of Rights would not</p>
<p>even get out of committee if you tried to pass it today.</p>
<p>People today adhere to a bunch of marketing slogans.</p>
<p>Like when you say the national anthem,</p>
<p>or the Pledge of Allegiance, or any of these things,</p>
<p>and all these wonderful words come out, and we cherish them,</p>
<p>and we almost treat them with a sort of a religious devotion.</p>
<p>But never delve into what they mean, nor talk about,</p>
<p>you know, when you say something on liberty,</p>
<p>what is the practical meaning of that, right?</p>
<p>And this is where you get into the devil&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in the details question.</p>
<p>But if I was in charge of the school curriculum,</p>
<p>these are the kind of things we would be asking, right?</p>
<p>What do we mean?</p>
<p>Are we talking about just political rights, which</p>
<p>is in one time period what they were talking about?</p>
<p>Because in 1787, you had a lot of states</p>
<p>that felt just fine cracking down on people&rsquo;s morals,</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t think about that as an infringement</p>
<p>on their liberty at all.</p>
<p>But you go to the 1960s, and there</p>
<p>was a whole new generation of Americans</p>
<p>that were saying, wait a minute, we believe in liberty, too.</p>
<p>But liberty means my right to do what</p>
<p>I want, as long as it doesn&rsquo;t hurt someone else.</p>
<p>What was it Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes said?</p>
<p>The right to swing my fist ends where</p>
<p>the other man&rsquo;s nose begins.</p>
<p>Well, what I&rsquo;ve said is we live in an era</p>
<p>where everybody&rsquo;s noses are growing</p>
<p>euphemistically longer, right?</p>
<p>And so, I mean, if you change what constitutes harm,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the equivalent of being Pinocchio.</p>
<p>And it becomes a time period where now nobody</p>
<p>can swing their fist without contacting</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s ever elongated nose, which</p>
<p>means that our liberty is all being constrained,</p>
<p>because now we hurt people with comments on Twitter, right?</p>
<p>As opposed to the real infringement on liberty</p>
<p>is telling somebody, no, you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>walk on this side of town.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an infringement on liberty</p>
<p>that everybody 50 years ago would have understood.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t mean that they were going to let</p>
<p>black folks cross over the tracks</p>
<p>and go to their side of town, but they</p>
<p>would have understood it.</p>
<p>In this day and age, we&rsquo;re so easily hurt.</p>
<p>And if that becomes the Oliver Wendell Holmes point at which</p>
<p>we can restrict people&rsquo;s behavior and liberty,</p>
<p>we aren&rsquo;t going to be able to do anything.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that&rsquo;s a funny thing that everybody,</p>
<p>and this is across the political spectrum,</p>
<p>everybody seem to love play the victim.</p>
<p>The people who scream about how everybody else is playing</p>
<p>the victim more often are doing it in a can</p>
<p>you believe what they are doing to us kind of way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this culture of victimhood that&rsquo;s people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like you&rsquo;re scoring a point</p>
<p>if you are the beaten underdog.</p>
<p>And people seem to really thrive on it.</p>
<p>Like it seemed to be a popular concept today.</p>
<p>Let me ask a question because I don&rsquo;t know the answer,</p>
<p>but I wonder about it a lot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be curious on your view.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t decide if Americans today,</p>
<p>and when I say Americans today, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking about the grand whole.</p>
<p>But I think when we&rsquo;re talking about technology</p>
<p>being the way we figure this out,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re probably skewing young on that, right?</p>
<p>Are Americans today just more jerks than they used to be?</p>
<p>Or are we more able to express ourselves?</p>
<p>And so we see that Americans, and I&rsquo;m saying Americans,</p>
<p>but this is a global phenomenon.</p>
<p>Is this a culture where we&rsquo;re just trolls</p>
<p>to each other all the time?</p>
<p>Or is this because of our ability to express ourselves</p>
<p>has become democratized with social media and everything</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re just seeing how Americans and other people</p>
<p>around the world would have been 50 years ago</p>
<p>had they had the tools?</p>
<p>I mean, had Nazi Germany been on Twitter with Chamberlain&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Britain and France at the time, period, and Imperial Japan?</p>
<p>I mean, can we imagine the 1940s world with our social media</p>
<p>now?</p>
<p>Would we have been any nicer to each other?</p>
<p>Or is this, in other words, I guess</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m asking, is this a human phenomenon?</p>
<p>Or are we seeing a change in people&rsquo;s attitudes</p>
<p>that is a result of the interplay</p>
<p>between social media and our political situation?</p>
<p>I think my feel on it is that it&rsquo;s 80% human nature,</p>
<p>and 20% some social conditions that have changed,</p>
<p>partially because of technology, but also</p>
<p>just loneliness and alienation.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s very different if you&rsquo;re having discussions,</p>
<p>if there is a community that you&rsquo;re part of,</p>
<p>if you have discussions face to face,</p>
<p>if you are used to mediating in that regard,</p>
<p>or if you are in your lonely four walls and one roof</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t need to have that kind of,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t grow that muscle that allow</p>
<p>you to mediate with other people on a regular basis</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>And so your communication is going</p>
<p>to be inevitably much more abrupt and harsh.</p>
<p>I think both facts, I would tend to say human nature is</p>
<p>human nature, it doesn&rsquo;t change radically.</p>
<p>But I do think that online communication</p>
<p>and heavy loneliness that most people feel</p>
<p>by not really being part of something larger</p>
<p>than often what&rsquo;s going on within their own four walls,</p>
<p>that contributes to not developing that ability</p>
<p>to have more nuance or mellow conversations</p>
<p>with other human beings.</p>
<p>Let me tie in something that may or may not be relevant,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s interesting because as you say that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking about something I was discussing</p>
<p>with somebody just the other day.</p>
<p>And it has to do with several articles I&rsquo;ve been reading</p>
<p>about young people not dating as much as they used to,</p>
<p>not having, I mean, in other words,</p>
<p>not going out to clubs to meet each other the way</p>
<p>we used to when I was a kid.</p>
<p>In other words, if you think of young people</p>
<p>as having a constant sort of a temperament</p>
<p>throughout most of history, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to go out, we&rsquo;re going to meet some girls,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to go out, you know, I mean,</p>
<p>all these things that we used to consider</p>
<p>to be just normal human things when we were kids.</p>
<p>Fast forward to now where we&rsquo;ve introduced a variable,</p>
<p>the technology, right?</p>
<p>Something that had never been a part of the debate before.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re seeing a generation of people,</p>
<p>and again, broad generalizations here,</p>
<p>but I mean, I&rsquo;ve got two kids who are teenagers myself.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t date as much as we did.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have face-to-face conversations.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know how to walk up to somebody</p>
<p>that makes them nervous and ask them out.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe this is something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a variable that changes an equation that used to be</p>
<p>pretty consistent throughout most of human history</p>
<p>because we were dealing with human beings,</p>
<p>and they can be pretty consistent, you know,</p>
<p>across a variable spectrum.</p>
<p>But you add this social media thing,</p>
<p>and I say social media, but it&rsquo;s the whole thing, right?</p>
<p>Social media encompassing everything,</p>
<p>including texting, I mean, everything.</p>
<p>And you have an entire maybe generation,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to be interesting when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the parents raising the next generation,</p>
<p>of people who interact with each other</p>
<p>in very different ways.</p>
<p>And so maybe, you know, in the same way</p>
<p>that I would have thought it would be much easier</p>
<p>to ask a girl out on a date just by texting her</p>
<p>than having to walk up in front of her</p>
<p>and deal with the embarrassment of being</p>
<p>shot down in person if that happens,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s easier to call somebody a jerk.</p>
<p>Or maybe it&rsquo;s easier to say, you know,</p>
<p>to pick a fight or call people names</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t have to do it face-to-face.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s a function of the technology.</p>
<p>Absolutely, and I think that is&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re changing the rules of human communication</p>
<p>within a couple of decades,</p>
<p>and we have no blueprint for how to do it.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s kind of like somebody who</p>
<p>got at the wheel of a car and has never known</p>
<p>anybody who drove a car, never drove a car.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have a user manual,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just like, go ahead,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see what happens kind of thing.</p>
<p>We are playing a dangerous game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a health, in some ways, a beautiful game</p>
<p>because so many amazing things have happened</p>
<p>in the last 20 years because of technological innovation.</p>
<p>So by no means the, back in my days,</p>
<p>before this evil technology screwed us all up,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m saying at all.</p>
<p>But there are clearly some issues</p>
<p>that we haven&rsquo;t really figured out how to deal with</p>
<p>that are, as much as they are contributing</p>
<p>to creating more opportunities and some amazing stuff,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re also contributing to some serious problems</p>
<p>that we have no solution to.</p>
<p>I think that leads into the last thing</p>
<p>we were thinking about discussing today,</p>
<p>the trends and forces and the ability of an individual</p>
<p>to make a difference in an era where it seems like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much, how would you describe it, Daniele?</p>
<p>I mean, we always used to just call it trends and forces</p>
<p>versus individual initiative.</p>
<p>But I mean, in this social media thing,</p>
<p>I mean, I was just, I was reading a review of a book</p>
<p>by Shoshana Zuboff, it&rsquo;s called Surveillance Capitalism.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just another one in a long line of books</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s explaining how we&rsquo;re being diced and categorized</p>
<p>and files are essentially being kept on all of us</p>
<p>based on browsing histories and all these kinds of things.</p>
<p>And how dangerous this is if you think about,</p>
<p>you know, what&rsquo;s going to happen down the road</p>
<p>with all of this and yet how passive</p>
<p>so many of the younger generation are about this</p>
<p>and passive not so much because maybe they don&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>that it might be bad, but passive because they feel powerless.</p>
<p>What are you going to do, right?</p>
<p>Are you not going to participate in the modern world</p>
<p>just because everybody is putting together</p>
<p>predictive technologies that will begin to be able to know</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re going to be next week ahead of time?</p>
<p>Maybe let&rsquo;s introduce this topic</p>
<p>because it was the last thing we wanted to discuss today.</p>
<p>But the question of how much individual initiative</p>
<p>can play a role versus the trends and forces</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re all operating in.</p>
<p>And I think that is the problem sometimes</p>
<p>with slow moving catastrophes.</p>
<p>You know, you see where it&rsquo;s going.</p>
<p>You can tell way ahead that the direction is not</p>
<p>a healthy one.</p>
<p>And yet there is nothing you can do to steer it,</p>
<p>or at least you don&rsquo;t feel like.</p>
<p>Think like things like, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re serious that you did on the fall of the Roman Republic,</p>
<p>for example.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very clear that the trends you analyze</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t happen overnight.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t happen in one year or in 10 or in 50.</p>
<p>You can see them from like 200 years before</p>
<p>this process is beginning.</p>
<p>And many people are seeing it along the way.</p>
<p>They scream and shout saying we need to do something about it.</p>
<p>And clearly nobody&rsquo;s able to course correct for real</p>
<p>and avoid where the whole scenario is going.</p>
<p>Sometime, you know, there is something to be said about.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to say, oh, throw up your arms and say,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all powerless, forget it, just have fun while we can</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s all going in a bad direction anyway.</p>
<p>But at the same time, sometimes you</p>
<p>wonder how much as an individual you have an impact</p>
<p>on major historical forces.</p>
<p>I think, you know, in history, we have examples of both.</p>
<p>We have examples of individuals who</p>
<p>have managed to make a humongous difference.</p>
<p>But we have even more examples of times</p>
<p>where you see where things are going without the ability</p>
<p>to do something about it.</p>
<p>I mean, I mentioned earlier something</p>
<p>like environmental issues.</p>
<p>The fact that we live on a society that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>essentially polluting the very food we eat</p>
<p>or the air we breathe.</p>
<p>And we all know it.</p>
<p>We all understand that that&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>Nobody likes it.</p>
<p>And yet we&rsquo;re not able to make a switch.</p>
<p>Or, you know, if we are able, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking very small steps when something is moving faster</p>
<p>and more action is needed.</p>
<p>That tells you a lot about this.</p>
<p>And, you know, you can look at basically</p>
<p>every major civilization that has collapsed.</p>
<p>Usually the warning signs were there</p>
<p>long before they did collapse.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t happen in one day.</p>
<p>And yet, despite the fact that there were probably</p>
<p>very smart people living in those places,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t help being able to fix it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure whether I have a pessimistic or optimistic view</p>
<p>of things in this, because I can think of examples</p>
<p>where occasional individuals have made a big difference.</p>
<p>But I also get your, I kind of see it</p>
<p>as the same discussion as you do in common sense,</p>
<p>where you feel like, is it really worth it?</p>
<p>Am I making a difference?</p>
<p>Is this, can this really impact things or not?</p>
<p>I look at, you know, for me, I think some of this problem,</p>
<p>I have a hard time with it because, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just spent some of this conversation</p>
<p>talking about how much I believe in liberty and freedom</p>
<p>and people and all these kinds of things.</p>
<p>And yet there are certain kinds of problems</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t lend itself, it seems to me.</p>
<p>And again, I could be wrong about this.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re watching it unfold</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m trying to learn as we see it also.</p>
<p>But I mean, there are certain kinds of issues</p>
<p>that it seems like, instead of democracy,</p>
<p>because some of them are republics,</p>
<p>some of them are parliamentarians.</p>
<p>I mean, people get hung up over words,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll call it a voter-driven system, maybe.</p>
<p>There are some problems that seem to be difficult</p>
<p>for a voter-driven system to deal with.</p>
<p>And usually they are long-term problems.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only one aspect of the totalitarian systems</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve ever been jealous of.</p>
<p>And that is their ability to plan long-term.</p>
<p>So the communists used to have in the Soviet Union</p>
<p>five-year plans and 10-year plans.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m jealous of those, because to me,</p>
<p>something like that would be unsustainable</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;d elect a different president</p>
<p>if we didn&rsquo;t like the plan and we&rsquo;d change course.</p>
<p>But so many of these problems require trade-offs</p>
<p>between the now and the later.</p>
<p>And people, I mean, for example,</p>
<p>if you said to me, listen, Dan,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to have to make changes</p>
<p>because of the environmental situation</p>
<p>that will hurt you and your family now,</p>
<p>but will benefit countless generations into the future.</p>
<p>That is a hard pill for people to swallow</p>
<p>who are trying to keep their heads above water now, right?</p>
<p>Think about, I always think about Superman.</p>
<p>If you go back and you read the Superman origin story,</p>
<p>it seems terribly prophetic for now, right?</p>
<p>Krypton&rsquo;s going to explode.</p>
<p>Superman&rsquo;s dad goes and tells the people on the council,</p>
<p>listen, we have to plan for this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>And they laugh at him, and of course,</p>
<p>we know what happens, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something to that now, where, I mean,</p>
<p>look at what happened in France, where the government there</p>
<p>tries to implement climate change protocols</p>
<p>and disagree with them or agree with the specific plans</p>
<p>they chose, doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>But the people then rebel, because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the ones who are going to have to pay the tax for that now.</p>
<p>You know, people who aren&rsquo;t making enough money</p>
<p>to make ends meet now, and so they rebel against that.</p>
<p>You kind of go, God, I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to live in a system where the only way we&rsquo;re going to make</p>
<p>the world survive is to overthrow</p>
<p>the will of the voters, because the will of the voters</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t possibly sacrifice now for generations yet unborn.</p>
<p>And yet, that seems to me to be a chink in our armor</p>
<p>in a democracy or a parliamentary system</p>
<p>or a republic.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on that?</p>
<p>I think that plays into the trends and forces thing,</p>
<p>because I think if the trends are bad long term</p>
<p>and they require us to all sacrifice, maybe</p>
<p>sacrifice for our lives now for children yet unborn,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s really difficult for us to imagine doing.</p>
<p>And then you throw in the corruption,</p>
<p>where there are people who are going, heck, I&rsquo;m making money</p>
<p>now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to not cut these trees down now.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t live to benefit from the money these trees will make,</p>
<p>you know, 100 years from now, 200 years from now.</p>
<p>And I certainly won&rsquo;t benefit from using them</p>
<p>as a carbon sink.</p>
<p>I think the system works against us solving</p>
<p>those kind of long term problems.</p>
<p>And if the long term problems are existential,</p>
<p>then what does that mean?</p>
<p>There was a great line of congressmen debating</p>
<p>with Theodore Roosevelt back in the day</p>
<p>about environmental policies.</p>
<p>And the guy said, I kid you not, posterity?</p>
<p>What has posterity ever done for me?</p>
<p>Well, listen, and it&rsquo;s more than that,</p>
<p>because everybody likes to focus on the climate change question,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s right in our face.</p>
<p>And we get into the question of is there or isn&rsquo;t there</p>
<p>and blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>To me, once again, that&rsquo;s the shiny object.</p>
<p>Because there are, even if you want</p>
<p>to say that we must do something about that, OK,</p>
<p>have that debate elsewhere.</p>
<p>But who&rsquo;s against clean water, right?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a number of these pollution issues</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re going, really?</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t we agree on let&rsquo;s not pollute the fresh water?</p>
<p>But we fight that.</p>
<p>Yeah, that seems pretty basic, exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it should be an absolutely non-partisan</p>
<p>issue.</p>
<p>Is clean water a Republican-Democratic?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy, but it&rsquo;s the same short term, long term deal.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s precisely the problem,</p>
<p>that as long as short term special interests are ruling</p>
<p>the conversation, it&rsquo;s very hard to have</p>
<p>any kind of long term discussion about what benefits humanity</p>
<p>as a whole, for sure.</p>
<p>Well, and how does it fare into the imperial debate?</p>
<p>I mean, there was a wonderful 60 Minutes story a while back</p>
<p>that was talking about tanks, you know,</p>
<p>armored vehicles, right?</p>
<p>And Congress was voting on, should we or shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>we build more tanks?</p>
<p>And the military came to Congress and said,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t need any more tanks.</p>
<p>We have them all sitting on lots.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all covered up.</p>
<p>We have more than we need.</p>
<p>And yet, they voted for more tanks</p>
<p>because the people in the districts</p>
<p>of the representatives make a living</p>
<p>building stuff for tanks.</p>
<p>So in other words, it&rsquo;s the tail wagging the dog</p>
<p>there, and we have a system where</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to continue this imperial sort of thing</p>
<p>for what Eisenhower talked about, right?</p>
<p>The military industrial complex, not just</p>
<p>because it benefits the big fat cats in the corporations that</p>
<p>make this stuff, but because it benefits the workers</p>
<p>themselves who are trying to feed their family</p>
<p>and put food on the table.</p>
<p>Absolutely, and I think that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>sometimes that clash of interest is</p>
<p>what leads to decisions that seem to make no sense.</p>
<p>But let me, just for the sake of not bumming everybody out,</p>
<p>let me try to throw a lighthearted one on you</p>
<p>that we can maybe wrap things up on.</p>
<p>The Dunkerque time machine, forget bringing back</p>
<p>US presidents, forget.</p>
<p>I know there are places where you</p>
<p>would like to be a fly on a wall in terms</p>
<p>of historical curiosity.</p>
<p>You know, being at the Battle of Cannes</p>
<p>would be fascinating in many ways.</p>
<p>It would probably not be fun, right?</p>
<p>It would not be like a happy occasion.</p>
<p>It would be a, what would be a happy one?</p>
<p>What would be, you know, if you do have your Dunkerque time</p>
<p>machine, a place where you wouldn&rsquo;t mind hanging out</p>
<p>for a while for fun, not for, wow,</p>
<p>I wonder what it would be like to see that live, but for, no,</p>
<p>I think I could have a good time there</p>
<p>for at least a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Oh, you know, I think of silly things.</p>
<p>That gets kind of personal where I&rsquo;m sitting here going,</p>
<p>you know, I want to see a boxing match between, you know,</p>
<p>Jack Dempsey, between Jack Dempsey.</p>
<p>I want to see things that were happening before I was born</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m interested in.</p>
<p>So instead of a real giant historical event,</p>
<p>like, you know, the signing of the Declaration of Independence,</p>
<p>I get down to silly little personal things</p>
<p>like, I want to see this, or I want to see, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a movie, and you know it, Field of Dreams, right?</p>
<p>Where the guy goes back and gets to play baseball with his dad</p>
<p>in a sort of a ghostly sort of sense.</p>
<p>And I get personal with that.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;d like to go meet my grandfather</p>
<p>when he was 30 years old and pal around with him.</p>
<p>I mean, so that&rsquo;s not really, like, global history.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s personal history.</p>
<p>Of course, but that&rsquo;s what makes it fun sometimes.</p>
<p>But those are the kind of things that fill up, like,</p>
<p>the top 10 list of things I&rsquo;d like to go back to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d have to get down to number 20, number 30, number 40</p>
<p>on the list before I met these giant political events,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re talking about the dark stuff.</p>
<p>And then I get, you know, I mean,</p>
<p>when you talked about wanting to see the Battle of Kenny</p>
<p>or any of those kinds of things, those are because I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know the answers.</p>
<p>So, and a lot of people don&rsquo;t know this,</p>
<p>but nobody has any idea what ancient warfare was like.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t reconstruct it, and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been a lot of attempts to do so.</p>
<p>So of course, you know, my mind says</p>
<p>I want to be suspended in a hot air balloon 150</p>
<p>feet above that battle so I can see exactly what the physics</p>
<p>of, you know, ancient combat looked like, right?</p>
<p>Of course, of course.</p>
<p>So those are, and those really aren&rsquo;t about history.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re about answering longstanding questions</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve had.</p>
<p>So I, but what about you?</p>
<p>Let me, let me return to, and turn the question around me.</p>
<p>Where would you like to be?</p>
<p>And again, where I would like to be probably for two hours,</p>
<p>because before modern medicine, the lack of modern medicine</p>
<p>kicks in and all of that is a whole different scenario.</p>
<p>But I am absolutely fascinated with pre-state societies.</p>
<p>So even going way back in the day,</p>
<p>like what is life like in a hunting and gathering tribe?</p>
<p>Like the way we have lived for most of human history</p>
<p>10,000 years ago as the last ice age is giving away</p>
<p>and a new world is coming into being.</p>
<p>What would that feel like?</p>
<p>Now again, I give myself two hours,</p>
<p>because by then, you know, I feel like between predator</p>
<p>sitting me and the tribe next door</p>
<p>clubbing me on the head or things like that</p>
<p>may get unpleasant really fast.</p>
<p>But that would be one that fascinates me quite a bit.</p>
<p>I was reading some interesting books</p>
<p>on some of the studies that were done</p>
<p>in the early and mid 20th century</p>
<p>by some of these people that were</p>
<p>trying to recreate as best they could exactly</p>
<p>what you were talking about.</p>
<p>So they were going to the last few societies</p>
<p>on the planet that still basically</p>
<p>functioned as they used to.</p>
<p>So New Guinea was one of the places that they used to go to.</p>
<p>And there are photographs of these tribes in New Guinea</p>
<p>that are fighting each other that the archaeologists</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s an anthropologist, the anthropologists</p>
<p>took photos of and then tried to extrapolate</p>
<p>what you learned from watching those tribes</p>
<p>to every other pre-industrial state throughout history.</p>
<p>I mean, to me, that&rsquo;s the closest</p>
<p>you can come to a time machine to try to see what</p>
<p>it was that you wanted to see.</p>
<p>And you know, it&rsquo;s a little sad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little like the extinction</p>
<p>of an animal species.</p>
<p>But it would be a lot harder to do that today</p>
<p>if you wanted to.</p>
<p>You might have to go invade some of those few islands</p>
<p>off the coast of India or whatever, where there is still.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe not.</p>
<p>Although that could be dangerous, too.</p>
<p>Yeah, as we have seen, exactly.</p>
<p>See, I have to turn it dark somehow at the end.</p>
<p>I know, man.</p>
<p>I was trying to go for the lighthearted one, but.</p>
<p>No, this is proprietary, Daniele.</p>
<p>We leave it on the dark side.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>OK, that&rsquo;s the way it goes.</p>
<p>Cool, man.</p>
<p>Well, thank you so much for the conversation.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>You too, buddy.</p>
<p>My thanks to Daniele for coming on the program.</p>
<p>Or did I go on his?</p>
<p>Well, probably a little of both.</p>
<p>I enjoyed talking with him, as always.</p>
<p>I talk with him more than you hear me talk with him.</p>
<p>So this was just one of those times where we, you know,</p>
<p>let you all listen in.</p>
<p>I did have an addendum, as I said,</p>
<p>to Hardcore History Addendum.</p>
<p>After that discussion, I thought of something</p>
<p>I should have brought up when we were talking about the Nazis</p>
<p>and the company they keep.</p>
<p>And how they&rsquo;re going to do it.</p>
<p>And how this should somehow be factored</p>
<p>into where you want to place them</p>
<p>on any political spectrum.</p>
<p>We neglected, we, the royal we, me, all by myself,</p>
<p>neglected to bring up the groups in Germany</p>
<p>after the First World War that were</p>
<p>associated with the Nazis.</p>
<p>In other words, we had talked about countries</p>
<p>that wouldn&rsquo;t have associated themselves with leftists.</p>
<p>But what about elements in German society?</p>
<p>I mean, how do I forget to bring up</p>
<p>the paramilitary groups like the Stahlhelm and the Freikorps,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>These groups that were formed mostly of disgruntled</p>
<p>and maybe rootless and lost veterans after the war</p>
<p>who signed up to police, you know, Germany&rsquo;s streets</p>
<p>and root out and beat up or kill communists.</p>
<p>These are people who fought for the emperor.</p>
<p>They are people whom&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no leftism attached to them at all.</p>
<p>I mean, these are people who fought for the emperor.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no leftism attached to them at all.</p>
<p>I mean, these are people that wanted a monarch</p>
<p>and were fiercely anti-communist and anti-Marxist</p>
<p>and think that those people stabbed them in the back.</p>
<p>Remember that phrase?</p>
<p>And that that&rsquo;s how they lost the First World War.</p>
<p>The person that will begin to associate himself</p>
<p>with the Nazis early on, they will break</p>
<p>over competing weird conspiratorial beliefs.</p>
<p>But early on is General Ludendorff,</p>
<p>Erich Ludendorff, you remember him, right?</p>
<p>He was in the German army for a bunch of the war</p>
<p>and was basically one half of a military dictatorship</p>
<p>that commanded Germany over the last couple of years</p>
<p>of the First World War.</p>
<p>This is an ardent anti-leftist.</p>
<p>This is a monarchist.</p>
<p>I mean, why would Ludendorff be taking pictures</p>
<p>with Hitler and associating themselves with the Nazis?</p>
<p>And by the way, during Hitler&rsquo;s great march,</p>
<p>you know, to try to take over the government,</p>
<p>the one he ended up in jail for,</p>
<p>where they got shot at by police</p>
<p>and Hermann Goring took a bullet in the groin.</p>
<p>One guy supposedly didn&rsquo;t fall to the ground</p>
<p>when the rifles went off, and that was Ludendorff</p>
<p>marching in the front with everybody.</p>
<p>He supposedly walks right up to the police</p>
<p>holding the rifles, who just shot down</p>
<p>a bunch of people, including his own butler.</p>
<p>And Ludendorff just moves the rifle to one side</p>
<p>and walks past him.</p>
<p>This guy is not going to associate himself with,</p>
<p>you know, Marxist-Leninist revolutionaries.</p>
<p>You know, the old line from The French King</p>
<p>holds true here, but this guy is the virtual representation</p>
<p>of the old state and the old regime.</p>
<p>This is everything that the leftists were fighting against.</p>
<p>Why on earth would he associate himself with the Nazis?</p>
<p>And why would groups like the Freikorps</p>
<p>and the Stahlhelm do that, if they thought the Nazis</p>
<p>were anything like the leftists that they loathed</p>
<p>and that they blamed for the stab in the back theory?</p>
<p>I mean, it just, as I said, there&rsquo;s a lot of ways</p>
<p>to create a political spectrum, as something to graft</p>
<p>the political beliefs of people.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no question that the one I grew up with,</p>
<p>the traditional one, is extremely limited.</p>
<p>But as we said, if you&rsquo;re going to change this,</p>
<p>then we ought to acknowledge that.</p>
<p>And there are people that you&rsquo;ll see that will make</p>
<p>other people out to be idiots, because they don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>Nazis are on the left.</p>
<p>No, that makes the person who says that maybe look like</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know that the rules have been changed.</p>
<p>As I said, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that,</p>
<p>but you kind of have to say that you changed what, you know,</p>
<p>you put in the equation for X or Y, when you, you know,</p>
<p>slam somebody for getting a different answer than you got,</p>
<p>especially if they were using the old math.</p>
<p>Stay safe, everyone.</p>
