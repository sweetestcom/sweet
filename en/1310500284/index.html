    <p>Talking about an exciting thing for an engineer,</p>
<p>the same Snapdragon that goes to a phone</p>
<p>and it can go to a Galaxy phone, for example, Samsung,</p>
<p>the same, not a special one, went all the way to Mars.</p>
<p>You expect to have a full day of battery life,</p>
<p>but then you want it to not be sending data</p>
<p>into 10 or 100 megabits.</p>
<p>You want gigabits.</p>
<p>You want it to be able to have eight core processors.</p>
<p>You want to have a GPU with ray tracing.</p>
<p>You want to have all of those things</p>
<p>that you can only get into sometimes a desktop PC.</p>
<p>To do all of that in your phone is an incredible thing.</p>
<p>Some people raise concerns about there not being enough</p>
<p>studies about the effects of 5G on the human body.</p>
<p>Is 5G safe?</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Cristiano Aman,</p>
<p>the CEO of Qualcomm.</p>
<p>The company that&rsquo;s one of the leaders in the world</p>
<p>in the space of mobile communication and computation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G that connects billions of phones,</p>
<p>and the Snapdragon processor and system on a chip</p>
<p>that is the brain of most of the premium Android phones</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Cristiano Aman.</p>
<p>You are originally from Brazil,</p>
<p>so let me ask the most important question,</p>
<p>the most profound question, the biggest question.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the greatest football soccer player of all time?</p>
<p>Look, everybody&rsquo;s gonna say Pele,</p>
<p>and actually I was born during the game</p>
<p>of Brazil and Italy that Pele gave Brazil the championship.</p>
<p>Actually it was, my dad tells me that the doctor</p>
<p>had a TV on at the delivery room.</p>
<p>But, so everybody will say Pele,</p>
<p>but I really like Ronaldo.</p>
<p>The first, not Ronaldinho, the first Ronaldo.</p>
<p>I really like him.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my favorite player.</p>
<p>By the way, not everybody would say Pele.</p>
<p>But we shall leave that on the table</p>
<p>and agree to disagree.</p>
<p>Brazilians will say Pele.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other countries around that region</p>
<p>that may disagree a little bit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very aware.</p>
<p>Qualcomm is largely responsible for 5G</p>
<p>and some of the greatest processors</p>
<p>in our smartphones ever built.</p>
<p>So we got communication and computation tech</p>
<p>that impacts probably billions of people.</p>
<p>So if you zoom out, you as a human,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll look at humans on Earth in general,</p>
<p>does it blow your mind that we have these billions</p>
<p>of smartphones communicating and each of them</p>
<p>have the computational power?</p>
<p>You know, you talk about 10 billion transistors.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a million times more than 50 years ago</p>
<p>in the best computers in the world.</p>
<p>Like if you just zoom out as a human,</p>
<p>does that blow your mind?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Look, one of the reasons I think I love this company</p>
<p>is we know that the technology we develop</p>
<p>can change the world.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you one more thing.</p>
<p>Beyond the amount of processing power</p>
<p>that you have now in the palm of your hands</p>
<p>and being every one of the world is connected</p>
<p>with broadband technology,</p>
<p>the smartphone is also mankind largest development platform.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing like it.</p>
<p>So you respect both the hardware and the software?</p>
<p>Both.</p>
<p>If aliens were observing Earth over the past 50 to 70 years,</p>
<p>how do you think they would describe</p>
<p>this particular turmoil, fun things going on</p>
<p>on the surface of this particular little planet?</p>
<p>We live in interesting times.</p>
<p>In one time, we see incredible development of technology</p>
<p>for mankind just what happened in the last century.</p>
<p>You know, from 1900 to 2000, it was incredible development.</p>
<p>Just look, 2000 was 22 years ago,</p>
<p>how far we&rsquo;re coming and where we&rsquo;re going with technology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>What do you think they would notice?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s road networks, there&rsquo;s all kinds of networks.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lights that keep popping up,</p>
<p>cities springing up, like from an alien perspective,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re observing.</p>
<p>Well, what I&rsquo;m gonna tell you is you have this contrast</p>
<p>of incredible development of technology,</p>
<p>but then you see some of the things</p>
<p>that are happening right now,</p>
<p>which is probably you would not expect them to happen</p>
<p>on the 21st century, just what happened in Ukraine.</p>
<p>So I think that will be a more puzzling question</p>
<p>for the aliens, I would imagine.</p>
<p>The new technology is kind of impressive.</p>
<p>Actually, that might not be so puzzling</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s just human nature revealing itself</p>
<p>as it has throughout human history.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about wireless communication.</p>
<p>So Qualcomm was instrumental in developing 5G.</p>
<p>Now you were with Qualcomm since the early days,</p>
<p>the good old 90s with the 2G, but what is 5G,</p>
<p>including sub six gigahertz 5G and millimeter wave 5G?</p>
<p>How does it work?</p>
<p>And maybe the most important question is</p>
<p>how will it change the world in the coming years?</p>
<p>When we set ourselves to develop 5G,</p>
<p>and we look at this, every generation of technology</p>
<p>had a problem to be solved, right?</p>
<p>So you mentioned 2G, 2G challenge,</p>
<p>the challenge of CDMA was can we give every person</p>
<p>on earth a cell phone?</p>
<p>That was, can you get to a technology</p>
<p>that you can basically allow everyone</p>
<p>to have a mobile phone?</p>
<p>3G was about the ability to connect that to the internet.</p>
<p>I think 4G was broadband and with 4G was about</p>
<p>have the ability for you to have a computer</p>
<p>in the palm of your hand.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll just talk about that.</p>
<p>5G, the challenge was a little bit different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how do we build a technology for a society</p>
<p>that is gonna be 100% connected to the cloud?</p>
<p>How do we provide a technology that is going to be</p>
<p>the last mile connectivity for everything?</p>
<p>So 5G has basically been designed,</p>
<p>eliminate all issues with data congestion,</p>
<p>whether you are in stadium, we talk about soccer,</p>
<p>you were in a stadium and everyone should be</p>
<p>ability to have access to broadband.</p>
<p>So deal with congestion.</p>
<p>Deal with the fact that not only people,</p>
<p>but billions of things need to be connected.</p>
<p>Create a technology that for the first time in wireless,</p>
<p>you could deliver mission critical services.</p>
<p>Wireless used to up to 4G is its best effort.</p>
<p>In 5G, it can guarantee that you are connected</p>
<p>with the cloud.</p>
<p>And then the last point of that is provide this fabric</p>
<p>that will allow us as a society to look at things</p>
<p>that are not connected and say, that&rsquo;s the exception.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we made a comparison in the early days of 5G</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s gonna be like electricity.</p>
<p>Right now, you don&rsquo;t have a discussion</p>
<p>about what is the use cases for electricity.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t talk about that anymore.</p>
<p>You just assume it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how we think about everything</p>
<p>connected to the cloud.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what 5G is and that&rsquo;s the role of 5G.</p>
<p>So first of all, everything connected to the cloud</p>
<p>is interesting because the space of everything</p>
<p>is constantly increasing.</p>
<p>That is correct.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the refrigerator over there,</p>
<p>it looks kind of smart,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s connected yet to the cloud.</p>
<p>So this includes internet of things.</p>
<p>What is the full space of everything?</p>
<p>The full space of everything is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s maybe going back to where you start defining Qualcomm.</p>
<p>Qualcomm is about communications and advanced computers</p>
<p>for low power devices.</p>
<p>And can we make everything smart?</p>
<p>It can range from the robot you have right now on the floor</p>
<p>to your refrigerator, to a camera,</p>
<p>to machines in manufacturing,</p>
<p>to retail, et cetera.</p>
<p>I can give you some examples.</p>
<p>When we think of something as simple</p>
<p>as going to the grocery shop,</p>
<p>we see technology now with something,</p>
<p>the stuff we&rsquo;ve been working with companies like Walmart.</p>
<p>Electronic shelf labels.</p>
<p>The ability for you to have smart cameras,</p>
<p>they can look at shelves and the camera is smart enough</p>
<p>to say some product needs to be replenished.</p>
<p>Ability to see what&rsquo;s trashed.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s about really providing processor connectivity,</p>
<p>artificial intelligence to everything.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s one of the largest addressable markets</p>
<p>we have for technology</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t really define everything.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nice market</p>
<p>because it keeps growing potentially exponentially in speed.</p>
<p>What about coverage?</p>
<p>So how are we doing on the everything part?</p>
<p>So there is, like I mentioned, sub six gigahertz 5G</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a millimeter wave 5G.</p>
<p>So not all 5G is made the same.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a speed, there&rsquo;s a bandwidth thing.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s coverage.</p>
<p>How many people get to enjoy today</p>
<p>and how does the progress in the next five, 10, 20, 30,</p>
<p>50 years you think looks like in terms of coverage?</p>
<p>Great topic of conversation.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about this.</p>
<p>When I meet with regulators across the globe,</p>
<p>I tell them resistance is futile.</p>
<p>Allocate every spectrum to wireless.</p>
<p>Every spectrum needs to be allocated to wireless.</p>
<p>The reality is when we start moving from CDMA to OFDMA,</p>
<p>we knew that this industry has done a lot</p>
<p>to get more bits per Hertz.</p>
<p>But the reality is the massive amount of improvements</p>
<p>that is required in capacity and in speed,</p>
<p>you need more spectrum.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not so much we can rely on more bits per Hertz.</p>
<p>You just need more spectrum.</p>
<p>And if you look, for example,</p>
<p>what carriers since the 2G era,</p>
<p>they participate in different license and auctions</p>
<p>and every spectrum they accumulated from 2G or 3G or 4G,</p>
<p>all of that, you may be able to get one or two channels max</p>
<p>of sub six, which is a channel is about 100 megahertz</p>
<p>or 200 megahertz, and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>So we need more spectrum.</p>
<p>So 5G has been designed to work across every spectrum</p>
<p>from the low frequency bands, that&rsquo;s what we call the sub six,</p>
<p>but you needed more, you needed to go to the millimeter wave.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why 5G is a technology that you can deploy</p>
<p>from 450 megahertz as an example, or 600 or 700,</p>
<p>all the way to in the 42 gigahertz.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where millimeter wave comes into the picture.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s now connect this to your question</p>
<p>about coverage of 5G.</p>
<p>The easiest thing to do is to deploy 5G</p>
<p>in the new spectrum you can get,</p>
<p>which is in the sub six, you see bands being auctioned</p>
<p>across the globe into 3.5 gigahertz.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing special about the band,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the only one that was available</p>
<p>because everything else has been useful for 4G.</p>
<p>And you can deploy on that, go into existing cell towers</p>
<p>and just put a new equipment</p>
<p>without having to build new towers.</p>
<p>But when we go to technologies such as millimeter wave,</p>
<p>then you have to build more dense networks.</p>
<p>You need to build more stations</p>
<p>because a deployment in that case</p>
<p>look like a wifi deployment,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like wifi access points.</p>
<p>When you need to build more stations, you need permits,</p>
<p>you need to build fiber, so it takes more time to densify.</p>
<p>So what you see happening is coverage has been built fast</p>
<p>with sub six across the globe,</p>
<p>but now the United States also have the sub six.</p>
<p>So that gets you to coverage very fast.</p>
<p>But millimeter wave, it&rsquo;s moving.</p>
<p>And if I will say, for example, Verizon,</p>
<p>United States has had a leadership</p>
<p>in building millimeter wave, it takes time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say cities like Chicago, Manhattan</p>
<p>starting to get coverage.</p>
<p>It will be a process over a number of years</p>
<p>as you build those different access points type networks,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s inevitable.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not enough spectrum.</p>
<p>So every 5G operators just a matter of time</p>
<p>will have millimeter wave as well.</p>
<p>Resistance is futile.</p>
<p>Okay, so for millimeter wave,</p>
<p>we need density of access points.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the biggest resistance for Qualcomm</p>
<p>for human civilization?</p>
<p>Is it politicians, regulators, federal regulators?</p>
<p>Is it individual humans?</p>
<p>Is it not enough money from the consumer perspective?</p>
<p>Like who is the biggest pain in the butt?</p>
<p>From a Qualcomm standpoint, but answering the question</p>
<p>about what it takes to build all this technology.</p>
<p>I think regulators across the board</p>
<p>understood the importance of 5G.</p>
<p>I have not met a regulator that said,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really important to be late on 5G.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anybody wants to be late on 5G.</p>
<p>And as a result, we&rsquo;ve seen enormous amount of progress</p>
<p>in getting spectrum allocated to 5G.</p>
<p>I think the real issue is the time that it takes</p>
<p>to build infrastructure.</p>
<p>You know, investment in 5G infrastructure,</p>
<p>special millimeter wave is like building roads and ports.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>And those things take time.</p>
<p>Like one of the number one obstacle</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna hear from operators is site permit.</p>
<p>You know, sometimes they have to negotiate municipality</p>
<p>by municipality about permits to get new cell sites.</p>
<p>But you know, the networks will be densified</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna need all of that capacity</p>
<p>for the promise of the fully immersive augmented reality</p>
<p>that will replace phones and everything being connected</p>
<p>100% of the time.</p>
<p>This would not be a conversation with the CEO</p>
<p>if I did not ask questions that make you nervous.</p>
<p>Some people raise concerns about there not being enough</p>
<p>studies about the effects of 5G on the human body.</p>
<p>Is 5G safe?</p>
<p>Look, I have a very simple answer to this question.</p>
<p>As we build new capabilities, such as 5G,</p>
<p>power is going down, especially when you think</p>
<p>about reducing the number of base stations,</p>
<p>the network&rsquo;s becoming more dense.</p>
<p>So as you do that, the power becomes lower.</p>
<p>If your phone radiated from the phone and from the tower,</p>
<p>as you get closer to the tower,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need that much power to reach the tower.</p>
<p>So as we move from 4G to 5G,</p>
<p>I think we see a reduction in the amount of power</p>
<p>is required to close the radio link.</p>
<p>Now, also you have a number of organizations,</p>
<p>the FCC, for example, has rigorous programs,</p>
<p>which they do a lot of tests to validate, you know,</p>
<p>the safety of those devices.</p>
<p>And I think we have, has been a model for other countries</p>
<p>to also to adopt the same things.</p>
<p>Cellular has been around for a number of decades now.</p>
<p>I think smartphone is our most beloved device today.</p>
<p>And I would argue how it&rsquo;s difficult</p>
<p>to answer those questions,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll argue that the data to date</p>
<p>have we seen in 3G and 4G, you know,</p>
<p>has shown that a lot of the initial concerns</p>
<p>were not valid.</p>
<p>We look at 5G, even though it&rsquo;s new, it&rsquo;s just less power.</p>
<p>So we look at it from a physics standpoint.</p>
<p>So from a physics, from a biology perspective,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of evidence, there&rsquo;s studies</p>
<p>that show that it&rsquo;s not dangerous, that it is in fact safe.</p>
<p>However, the concern that people have</p>
<p>is when you scale technology exponentially,</p>
<p>how will that change human civilization?</p>
<p>I mean, that doesn&rsquo;t apply to 5G,</p>
<p>that applies to every technology.</p>
<p>How, you said smartphone is the most beloved device,</p>
<p>but love sometimes hurts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the impact on society we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a little bit of fear,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s both excitement and fear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great topic of conversation actually.</p>
<p>So let me give you my perspective on this.</p>
<p>And you started to see some things</p>
<p>actually happening right now.</p>
<p>So let me step back and let&rsquo;s talk about the fact</p>
<p>that we are in a fully interconnected society.</p>
<p>That when you look of the situation today,</p>
<p>we talk about smartphones, largest development platform,</p>
<p>so much now of our life, we are connected to the smartphone.</p>
<p>And we are all connected and we&rsquo;re connected.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re building digital twins of everything, right?</p>
<p>So when you look at that picture,</p>
<p>when you look at the picture of this connected society,</p>
<p>you started to have the following thoughts,</p>
<p>which I think are very healthy,</p>
<p>which means in the same way that in the physical world,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re entitled to some rights, you have obligations,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of things that protect your integrity.</p>
<p>I think as a rule, we&rsquo;re gonna see the society evolving.</p>
<p>So those things extend to your digital being</p>
<p>of people and things.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s just natural.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just natural.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a natural path.</p>
<p>And you started to see things like that.</p>
<p>For example, the Europeans has done a lot in this area.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say the Europeans probably ahead in the United States</p>
<p>thinking about privacy laws, digital privacy laws.</p>
<p>Most recently, the DMA, the Digital Markets Act,</p>
<p>which I think is a great thing.</p>
<p>I think we believe there&rsquo;s incredible thought</p>
<p>into enable ability to regulate the digital markets</p>
<p>so that there&rsquo;s innovation and competitions</p>
<p>and not a single company can control all the data</p>
<p>and then decide how things are gonna be work</p>
<p>on the digital realm.</p>
<p>And even if we think about the potential things</p>
<p>like the metaverse,</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re connecting physical and digital spaces.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s a natural evolution.</p>
<p>Of course, regulation and laws always follow technology.</p>
<p>But the fact that we&rsquo;re moving</p>
<p>to an interconnected society, there&rsquo;s no going back.</p>
<p>We are a fully interconnected society.</p>
<p>But there is opportunity to think about</p>
<p>how the digital twin should,</p>
<p>people and government should think about it</p>
<p>so that we get the best of a technology</p>
<p>without any downside.</p>
<p>Yeah, so when you say digital twin,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the other things you&rsquo;re excited about,</p>
<p>which is the metaverse,</p>
<p>or basically building worlds in the digital space.</p>
<p>And you have to start to think about</p>
<p>all the basic human rights that transfer</p>
<p>from our physical meat vehicles</p>
<p>out to the digital copies of ourselves,</p>
<p>representations of ourselves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really important to think about.</p>
<p>The thing you mentioned about regulators that has been,</p>
<p>this is me speaking frustrating,</p>
<p>is like you said, they follow technology.</p>
<p>So sometimes they don&rsquo;t get the technology at all.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re very clumsy in writing laws</p>
<p>that censor that technology in interesting ways.</p>
<p>They mean good, but they can do a lot of unintended damage.</p>
<p>Now, both, it&rsquo;s a dance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful dance,</p>
<p>but I just wish governments were better dance partners.</p>
<p>I just see what they&rsquo;re kind of writing now</p>
<p>about regulating social media and platforms like YouTube,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just really, really clumsy.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t understand how machine learning works.</p>
<p>I recommend their systems work.</p>
<p>And I just wish they kind of caught up a little more</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s really important to be great at regulation,</p>
<p>but also it&rsquo;s important to let companies flourish</p>
<p>and embrace this new wave of technology.</p>
<p>That weird dance, I am more and more learning</p>
<p>looking at public policy,</p>
<p>how much positive government can do</p>
<p>and how much clumsy negative it can do,</p>
<p>unintentionally, just out of sheer incompetence</p>
<p>or lack of curiosity about tech.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my rant about regulators.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a valid point.</p>
<p>As I said before, I think the Europeans</p>
<p>probably have a very good framework,</p>
<p>but the way I&rsquo;ll think about it,</p>
<p>we depend on having the ability to innovate.</p>
<p>We depend on the free markets.</p>
<p>We depend on the ability to create technology</p>
<p>that will be disruptive.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I think the tech companies</p>
<p>probably should spend time helping governments understand,</p>
<p>helping understand ahead of time</p>
<p>so that they can be better prepared.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about one of my favorite topics, Snapdragon.</p>
<p>So Snapdragon is a system on a chip.</p>
<p>This processor has probably powered billions of smartphones</p>
<p>over its pretty long history now,</p>
<p>a decade and a half maybe.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s constantly iterating.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s constantly just like a turmoil of beautiful</p>
<p>innovations happening.</p>
<p>So last year it was Snapdragon 888 was the main one</p>
<p>with the five nanometer,</p>
<p>and this year it&rsquo;s Snapdragon 8Gen1.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a new naming scheme.</p>
<p>Okay, what&rsquo;s the sexiest, most beautiful idea</p>
<p>or concept to you about Snapdragon?</p>
<p>Start there.</p>
<p>The way I would describe it,</p>
<p>and I think the reason we have been successful with it,</p>
<p>is to really understand how to build a platform,</p>
<p>a single chip, like a single chip,</p>
<p>that will have every single capability</p>
<p>if you wanna make this smartphone</p>
<p>in the palm of your hand,</p>
<p>something that has all of your computing needs.</p>
<p>And it was the ability to get,</p>
<p>from an engineering standpoint,</p>
<p>ability to get into a single chip</p>
<p>of not only all possible connectivity technology,</p>
<p>from cellular to wifi to Bluetooth</p>
<p>to every single constellation of satellites</p>
<p>for position location.</p>
<p>But at the same time,</p>
<p>a very power efficient single thread and multi threaded CPU.</p>
<p>A GPU for all of your graphic demands,</p>
<p>gaming, fastest growing segment for gaming,</p>
<p>is mobile gaming.</p>
<p>An artificial intelligence processor,</p>
<p>which we call the neuro processor unit.</p>
<p>And then a video engine,</p>
<p>and a multimedia engine for every single application,</p>
<p>audio, everything.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a single chip</p>
<p>that has every single computing technology</p>
<p>you need in the phone.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s exciting about it is what we already knew.</p>
<p>For example, when you think about camera or computer vision,</p>
<p>you see that the advancements in the technology</p>
<p>now happens in the smartphone first</p>
<p>versus additional camera.</p>
<p>So the beauty about the Snapdragon is</p>
<p>we always have this thing within Qualcomm.</p>
<p>The phone, it&rsquo;s small.</p>
<p>You have to be able to hold it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna touch your face so you cannot be hot.</p>
<p>You have to manage thermals.</p>
<p>You expect to have a full day of battery life.</p>
<p>But then you want it to not be sending data</p>
<p>into 10 or 100 megabits.</p>
<p>You want gigabits.</p>
<p>You want it to be able to have eight core processors.</p>
<p>You want to have a GPU with ray tracing.</p>
<p>You want to have all of the things</p>
<p>that you can only get into sometimes a desktop PC.</p>
<p>And to do all of that in your phone</p>
<p>and be able to be in the leadership position</p>
<p>generation after generation is an incredible thing.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re very proud of that at Qualcomm.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you have to do the WiFi, 5G, all of the&hellip;</p>
<p>And you have to be good to everyone of those technologies.</p>
<p>And pack it all in.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also pressure to make the thing</p>
<p>faster and faster and faster.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s more and more applications</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supposed to be effortlessly using.</p>
<p>And then you mentioned the NPU, GPU, CPU.</p>
<p>They have to also dance together somehow.</p>
<p>They have to communicate well, share memory or not,</p>
<p>depending on what the application is.</p>
<p>And your battery has to last all day.</p>
<p>So think about that.</p>
<p>From a company like Qualcomm, we have to be good</p>
<p>in each and every one of those technologies.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t just say, oh, we&rsquo;re a CPU company</p>
<p>or a GPU company or we&rsquo;re AI company.</p>
<p>We have to do everything.</p>
<p>What does it take to design a great processor?</p>
<p>So design this system on a chip that you mentioned.</p>
<p>Is there some insight you can provide</p>
<p>in this chaos of engineers, designers, leaders,</p>
<p>the people that think about how much</p>
<p>this is all gonna cost, the whole mess of it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, of course, very partial about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in this company for probably more than 26 years.</p>
<p>But I will argue that there are a couple things</p>
<p>that are ingredients for success.</p>
<p>So we talk about the fact that they have</p>
<p>all those different technologies.</p>
<p>They evolve at their own pace.</p>
<p>And you have to be good in each one of them.</p>
<p>And you need to then to make them working together.</p>
<p>So you need to have an engineering organization</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s with an incredible collaboration culture</p>
<p>because everybody has to be working.</p>
<p>The train&rsquo;s gonna leave the station.</p>
<p>Every cart needs to be there when it leaves the station.</p>
<p>It needs to leave on time,</p>
<p>especially in the phone business.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t change Christmas.</p>
<p>You cannot change Black Friday.</p>
<p>You cannot change all of the selling seasons.</p>
<p>So the phones are gonna launch on time.</p>
<p>And every technology needs to be there.</p>
<p>The engineer needs to work as one.</p>
<p>And we do have that at Qualcomm.</p>
<p>The other thing, you have to have incredible discipline</p>
<p>because those are very complex systems.</p>
<p>So in one way, you have to design with quality</p>
<p>because in many cases, we&rsquo;re gonna be ramping production.</p>
<p>And even before we have the silicon back</p>
<p>and you have to rely on our simulation models</p>
<p>and you have to rely on the fact</p>
<p>that you design for commercial applications.</p>
<p>That takes a while to build.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably been the history</p>
<p>of a semiconductor business at Qualcomm.</p>
<p>So you mean like the framework</p>
<p>of how many people can use simulation software</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff to build the thing</p>
<p>with a hard deadline that you might not even get back</p>
<p>from like manufacturer before.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not allowed to have any mistakes.</p>
<p>No wonder our name is quality communications.</p>
<p>Oh, I never even thought about the qual part.</p>
<p>Quality.</p>
<p>So quality and there&rsquo;s a bar that&rsquo;s high</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not allowed to mess up.</p>
<p>I mean, to me as an engineer, that&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>Hard deadlines, no room for mistakes.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Super stressful, but I love it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a couple of other small companies</p>
<p>called Google and Apple.</p>
<p>So Google is now using its own chip for the Pixel 6.</p>
<p>Apple using its own.</p>
<p>How does Qualcomm out compete Google and Apple?</p>
<p>How does it beat them?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to out compete Google.</p>
<p>Actually, if you look at our mobile strategy today,</p>
<p>and then one thing I was very clear when I became CEO,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of confusion in the market.</p>
<p>Our mobile strategy is very clear.</p>
<p>We are focused of making Snapdragon synonymous</p>
<p>with premium Android experience.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Snapdragon is.</p>
<p>Android, the phone of the people.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I just have a love for Android.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m constantly talking trash to iPhone people.</p>
<p>Sorry, go ahead.</p>
<p>Premium Android experiences.</p>
<p>So we do produce Snapdragon in multiple tier</p>
<p>for every price point, but every year,</p>
<p>you mentioned the HN1,</p>
<p>and every year we&rsquo;ll provide the flagship product.</p>
<p>And then the other series that is trying to get the best</p>
<p>of every possible technology at that time.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really focused on enabling the Android ecosystem.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll give an example.</p>
<p>So you asked me the question, how to compete with Google.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about competing with Google.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the number one enabler</p>
<p>of the Google Android ecosystem.</p>
<p>And the largest, the number one customer there</p>
<p>is actually Samsung.</p>
<p>And if you look what happened to Samsung,</p>
<p>Samsung, I always said,</p>
<p>since I began my relationship with them,</p>
<p>that cause they always had their own chip.</p>
<p>They always had their own chip.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ll just look at what happened right now</p>
<p>with the Galaxy S22 that just launched,</p>
<p>they used to balance their business about 50% Qualcomm.</p>
<p>They will get the most advanced markets</p>
<p>like the United States and China and Japan and Korea,</p>
<p>they will assign to Qualcomm.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;ll have their own chip for the markets</p>
<p>that they would be like more emerging markets,</p>
<p>open markets, markets that they have a control</p>
<p>on the channel because they sell a lot of appliances</p>
<p>and other things.</p>
<p>If you look what happened right now, GS22,</p>
<p>75% is Qualcomm.</p>
<p>And then the next large OEMs and Android ecosystem</p>
<p>are the Chinese ones.</p>
<p>Companies like Xiaomi, one of the fastest growing.</p>
<p>It was number one in Europe at some point last year,</p>
<p>then followed by Oppo and OnePlus and Vivo.</p>
<p>So those are some of the largest Qualcomm customers.</p>
<p>And they actually drive the Android ecosystem.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s our mobile strategy</p>
<p>and fully aligned with Google and it&rsquo;s working.</p>
<p>And not to get into a lot of the investor conversation,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re also happy we became a beneficiary</p>
<p>of the shifts that we saw in the marketplace.</p>
<p>As Huawei became a smaller OEM</p>
<p>as a result of the sanctions,</p>
<p>we saw the rise of a lot of the other OEMs from China,</p>
<p>especially for China domestic market, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo.</p>
<p>They moved to the premium category</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all doing that with Qualcomm.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re actually very fortunate and happy</p>
<p>with the position we are in mobile business.</p>
<p>We do have an Apple relationship.</p>
<p>We provide modem technology to Apple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a multi year relationship.</p>
<p>Apple has been very public that they are investing</p>
<p>to develop their own modem.</p>
<p>But the Qualcomm strategy has been clear.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re really focused on Snapdragon.</p>
<p>Our mobile strategy is not defined</p>
<p>by providing a cellular modem to Apple.</p>
<p>Our mobile strategy is this that we just talked about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the unique thing of Snapdragon</p>
<p>that has every single technology</p>
<p>integrated into a single SOC.</p>
<p>And provides a premium experience.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and focusing on the Android ecosystem.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I can ask you this kind of question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like picking your children or something like this.</p>
<p>But what smartphone with a Snapdragon?</p>
<p>You mentioned Samsung Galaxy S22, OnePlus.</p>
<p>Those are phones I personally really enjoy.</p>
<p>What phone do you currently use?</p>
<p>Or do you have multiple phones?</p>
<p>I do have multiple phones but I do use Galaxy S22.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your favorite one?</p>
<p>All right, well you heard it here first folks.</p>
<p>Okay, so excellent.</p>
<p>Can Qualcomm also, let&rsquo;s take a brief step away from mobile.</p>
<p>And take on Intel and Apple and other such companies</p>
<p>in the laptop and desktop space.</p>
<p>So the nature of what a computer is seems to be changing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like smartphones like merging.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all being a smartphone just with the biggest screen</p>
<p>or something like this.</p>
<p>So what does the future of that look like?</p>
<p>Before I answer that question,</p>
<p>let me just step back a little bit.</p>
<p>Because, and I&rsquo;m sure we can talk more about those things.</p>
<p>But the reality is Qualcomm is changing a lot.</p>
<p>And we use, I know we spend a lot of time</p>
<p>talking about 5G and smartphone and Snapdragon.</p>
<p>And I think that has been what had defined Qualcomm</p>
<p>for many years.</p>
<p>But the reality is, even consistent</p>
<p>with that 5G conversation, which is a technology</p>
<p>to connect everything, Qualcomm is also changing.</p>
<p>Our technology that was in many cases designed for phones.</p>
<p>And we said at the beginning, connectivity and processing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to virtually every industry.</p>
<p>And as a result, Qualcomm is really changing with it</p>
<p>and expanding to a number of different addressable markets.</p>
<p>Some of those markets is the PC, as you talk about it.</p>
<p>The conversions of mobile and PC.</p>
<p>And the reason I&rsquo;m excited about this,</p>
<p>because you see a lot of things happening</p>
<p>that bring this right front and center</p>
<p>when you think about the future technology.</p>
<p>So what we learn with the pandemic</p>
<p>is that the number one use case of personal computers</p>
<p>is communications.</p>
<p>It is interesting when you think about that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the number one use case on a PC today</p>
<p>is communications.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually funny because in the cellular industry,</p>
<p>actually I&rsquo;ll say, let me step back.</p>
<p>In the telecom industry, we&rsquo;ve been chasing</p>
<p>this killer application of video telephony for decades.</p>
<p>I remember back then in the wire line,</p>
<p>even before the internet and IP, ISDN,</p>
<p>you remember those AT&amp;T desk phones with a little screen</p>
<p>and they said, you can do video telephony.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t watch that in Back to the Future 2.</p>
<p>Then when we started developing 3G,</p>
<p>people said, what&rsquo;s the application for having data</p>
<p>to a cell phone?</p>
<p>All video telephony.</p>
<p>Then we started doing 4G.</p>
<p>And in the beginning, people said,</p>
<p>well, why do you need all of this broadband?</p>
<p>All video telephony.</p>
<p>But it took a pandemic to make video telephony</p>
<p>the killer application.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s now the number one use case on a PC.</p>
<p>So now think about that for a second.</p>
<p>Personal computers now, they&rsquo;re technologies</p>
<p>that people when they were gonna buy a PC,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t care much about it.</p>
<p>Now they do, camera.</p>
<p>Camera, how good is the camera?</p>
<p>The audio, is that connected?</p>
<p>How good is the connectivity?</p>
<p>Do you have the latest and greatest wifi and cellular?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the battery life?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re gonna be working from anywhere.</p>
<p>Sometimes you know that, sometimes you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>So all those things, what&rsquo;s the portability like?</p>
<p>So those things started to change</p>
<p>how we should think about the PC.</p>
<p>But I won&rsquo;t stop there.</p>
<p>Let me talk about another trend.</p>
<p>So, and all come as a result of what we saw the pandemic.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that you are,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re an engineer, you do computer aided design.</p>
<p>You have an advanced desktop computer</p>
<p>or workstation in your office.</p>
<p>But you wanna work from home someday.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not gonna move that to your home.</p>
<p>So what do you need to do?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have to rely on that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna run that on the cloud.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re gonna run it on the cloud.</p>
<p>You need high bandwidth</p>
<p>because you almost wanted the cloud</p>
<p>to be the same as your computer for that use case.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the 5G on demand computing use case.</p>
<p>The use 5G is almost a link between two computers.</p>
<p>But then, you know, CIOs are saying,</p>
<p>well, my workforce is going home for certain days.</p>
<p>I want all the data to be in the cloud.</p>
<p>You look at, for example, Microsoft OneDrive</p>
<p>or the ability to collaborate, you need the bandwidth.</p>
<p>So when you put all of those things together,</p>
<p>you start thinking about what is the next generation PC?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the opportunity for Qualcomm.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just give an example.</p>
<p>Back in Mobile World Congress recently, Lenovo,</p>
<p>they have a line of enterprise laptops called the ThinkPad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re familiar with it.</p>
<p>So they announced the ThinkPad based on Snapdragon.</p>
<p>With 5G on, 28 hours of battery life.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s next generation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a nice screen with extremely high, nice screen</p>
<p>and keyboard, and extremely high connectivity</p>
<p>to maybe an even more, like a more powerful machine</p>
<p>in the cloud.</p>
<p>Something more, the data, connecting to the data,</p>
<p>connecting to compute, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>You have the camera capabilities,</p>
<p>and let me go one step more.</p>
<p>Microsoft talking about some of the other features</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing now using, on Windows 11, using Snapdragon.</p>
<p>Remember, we talk about it,</p>
<p>Snapdragon has an AI processor inside there.</p>
<p>So one of the cool features Microsoft&rsquo;s talking about it is</p>
<p>you can be on a Teams call, and you can make sure</p>
<p>your eyes are looking at the camera 100% of the time.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s an interesting,</p>
<p>so they can be talking about that.</p>
<p>And you do that with AI.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s really tricky to pull off.</p>
<p>For example, the reason I&rsquo;m a huge stickler</p>
<p>for doing these in person, these conversations in person,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really tough to get right.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a worthy challenge.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where the metaverse hopes to,</p>
<p>so like, I just, because you said the importance</p>
<p>of this telephony of humans connecting,</p>
<p>teleporting themselves, getting that right</p>
<p>is really difficult.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people hate Zoom meetings,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t improve that experience</p>
<p>and get rid of the hate.</p>
<p>A lot of people hate talking to their car too,</p>
<p>because the voice, the natural language processing</p>
<p>is terrible, but when it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>So getting that right is.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity, this is an opportunity.</p>
<p>Think about it, it starts with the PC,</p>
<p>making the PC giving you a better experience for teams,</p>
<p>but then it goes right back into this trend</p>
<p>of connecting physical and digital spaces.</p>
<p>And all the work we&rsquo;re doing with the metaverse</p>
<p>and virtual reality and metareality in the future</p>
<p>is why not call somebody or connect with somebody</p>
<p>with a hologram, it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>And also to mention some increasing amount</p>
<p>of intelligence in our cars.</p>
<p>So semi autonomous, autonomous cars,</p>
<p>and the interactivity between human and car,</p>
<p>which for me, things are really exciting.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a big question.</p>
<p>So when aliens again now on the other side, right,</p>
<p>and humans destroy themselves through nuclear war</p>
<p>centuries from now.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope not.</p>
<p>But in case, you know, let&rsquo;s just hypothetical</p>
<p>thought experiment.</p>
<p>And they write a history of humanity in the 21st century.</p>
<p>What would they remember Qualcomm in the 21st century</p>
<p>as a company?</p>
<p>Would it be a car company?</p>
<p>Like think of all the crazy pivots that might happen</p>
<p>in the next like 50 years.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re thinking, you said Qualcomm enables</p>
<p>all of these things with 5G and there&rsquo;ll be probably</p>
<p>other Gs, it keeps increasing.</p>
<p>So basically connectivity and computation</p>
<p>and everything becomes connected and everything</p>
<p>is capable of computation.</p>
<p>Might you become a robotics and car company?</p>
<p>I will argue we&rsquo;re already an automotive company today.</p>
<p>But let me tell you what I would like Qualcomm to be,</p>
<p>remember and recognize for.</p>
<p>I think everyone that knows Qualcomm immediately,</p>
<p>you know, connect us, pun intended,</p>
<p>to connectivity and wireless.</p>
<p>But the reality is we&rsquo;re being actually the company</p>
<p>providing intelligence and processing to everything</p>
<p>on the edge, everything outside the data center</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Those billions of devices that are gonna be connected.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of explained when we talk about</p>
<p>the connected intelligent edge, the beyond phones,</p>
<p>cars, species, and all of those.</p>
<p>And the broader IOTs, we talk about everything</p>
<p>will be connected and intelligent.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we want Qualcomm to be recognized for.</p>
<p>So by the way, for people who are not familiar,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some technical jargon.</p>
<p>People use the word edge, like edge computing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, by the way, that&rsquo;s probably changing</p>
<p>what that even means.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s basically everything that&rsquo;s not a giant thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s making a lot of noise in a building somewhere.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s mobile devices and the mobile devices</p>
<p>of all kinds, well, a refrigerator&rsquo;s not mobile,</p>
<p>but it would be edge.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like what&rsquo;s a sandwich, that kind of discussion.</p>
<p>But basically edge computing is the edge</p>
<p>of that expanding space that you mentioned</p>
<p>that Qualcomm is trying to connect</p>
<p>and enable with computation.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a simple way to describe what the edge is</p>
<p>and edge computing is.</p>
<p>I think as we think about the evolution of the data center,</p>
<p>you need to bring the computational closer</p>
<p>to where the device is.</p>
<p>Also, when you put the computation together</p>
<p>with the connectivity at the same time,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna see a lot of advancement</p>
<p>of artificial intelligence happening closer</p>
<p>or at the device.</p>
<p>Look, it&rsquo;s a very, I have a simple way to describe it.</p>
<p>Remember in the beginning of this conversation,</p>
<p>we talk about in the 4G era, broadband</p>
<p>and mobile computing evolved side by side.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna have broadband,</p>
<p>you might as well have a computer in the palm of your hand.</p>
<p>So we needed to invest in those two technologies.</p>
<p>In 5G, AI develops side by side.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re connected to the cloud 100% of the time.</p>
<p>You have a high bandwidth and you have now</p>
<p>a smart and intelligent thing that can make decision</p>
<p>in real time, provide context information to the cloud</p>
<p>to make the models more accurate</p>
<p>and as well compare and contrast to the cloud.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s gonna be an exponential development of AI</p>
<p>happening with all the edge devices,</p>
<p>the devices that are outside the data center</p>
<p>and computation is gonna go alongside that.</p>
<p>And a great example of that is the car.</p>
<p>The car, we haven&rsquo;t talked much about the car,</p>
<p>but Qualcomm is now, you could argue was as much</p>
<p>as an automotive company as wireless company,</p>
<p>working 26 global brands.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s easy to see, if you look at our mobile heritage</p>
<p>and we talk about form factors, thermal, battery life,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna put a server in a trunk of a car,</p>
<p>but you need as much computational capabilities.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s we see Qualcomm providing,</p>
<p>as the car become a connected computer on wheels,</p>
<p>we provide the computational and all the sensors</p>
<p>for you to do assisted driving</p>
<p>for the new digital cockpit experience</p>
<p>connecting the car to the cloud</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all of that&rsquo;s happening at the edge.</p>
<p>Does Qualcomm want to be the brain</p>
<p>of a lot of autonomous vehicles in the future</p>
<p>of different, you said brands, like Mercedes,</p>
<p>BMW, I don&rsquo;t know, whatever, just whatever car.</p>
<p>Cars have the sexy thing they do</p>
<p>and then it defines their brand and so on.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the brain</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t need to have branding supposedly.</p>
<p>So does Qualcomm see that</p>
<p>or will I be able to buy a Qualcomm car?</p>
<p>Like literally it&rsquo;ll be Qualcomm.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re not gonna be able to buy a Qualcomm car,</p>
<p>but we are ready on our way to become the brains of the car.</p>
<p>The way you should think about Qualcomm automotive strategy</p>
<p>is the car companies realize</p>
<p>they need to become technology companies.</p>
<p>You just look, for example, of the market cap</p>
<p>of some of the new electrical commerce</p>
<p>and compare them with the legacy car companies.</p>
<p>Which one is that?</p>
<p>I heard of, one of them lives in Austin.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say Rivian, right?</p>
<p>Rivian.</p>
<p>Oh, that one too, yes.</p>
<p>You know, the car companies are not going away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a mistake not to bet in the car companies.</p>
<p>The car companies need a technology partner.</p>
<p>They will provide the digital chassis for them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So if you look at Qualcomm,</p>
<p>we talk about a Snapdragon digital chassis.</p>
<p>So we want to be the preferred technology partner</p>
<p>of the car companies, and I think it&rsquo;s working.</p>
<p>Strategy is working right now.</p>
<p>So basically helping the car companies</p>
<p>accelerate into becoming technology companies.</p>
<p>Connecting the car to the cloud,</p>
<p>redesign the interior of the digital cockpit experience,</p>
<p>and provide the computation and sensor capabilities</p>
<p>for autonomy and assisted driving.</p>
<p>On the topic of robots, when millions or billions</p>
<p>of robots roam the earth in the future among us humans,</p>
<p>and I am for one concerned in a small percentage,</p>
<p>but largely I&rsquo;m excited about that future,</p>
<p>will Qualcomm be the thing that powers their brain?</p>
<p>We have in our IoT business,</p>
<p>which has been one of the fastest growing business for us,</p>
<p>a number of robotics engagement.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll give you some example.</p>
<p>If you look of the Amazon Astro,</p>
<p>you familiar with that?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two Snapdragon in there.</p>
<p>There is?</p>
<p>This is really exciting.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re supposed to ship it to me.</p>
<p>Where is it?</p>
<p>Okay, but anyway, that&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know it was Snapdragon.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re working with robotics in industrial.</p>
<p>Of course, drones.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting more and more traction for robotics.</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>Industrial robotics, too, you said?</p>
<p>Industrial, especially when you think about</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s gonna happen with the factory of the future,</p>
<p>the industrial side of the future,</p>
<p>the warehouse of the future,</p>
<p>when you bring 5G, for example, to it,</p>
<p>and you have a number of different use cases,</p>
<p>and then you see a lot of robotics application.</p>
<p>And of course, drones.</p>
<p>And the most famous, I will consider that a robot,</p>
<p>the most famous robot in the world right now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s powered by Snapdragon,</p>
<p>which is the Mars Ingenuity helicopter.</p>
<p>The whole helicopter, the cameras and everything,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s powered by Snapdragon.</p>
<p>And talking about exciting thing for an engineer,</p>
<p>the same Snapdragon that goes to a phone,</p>
<p>and it can go to a Galaxy phone, for example, Samsung,</p>
<p>the same, not a special one, went all the way to Mars.</p>
<p>Is exploring other planets, looking for alien life,</p>
<p>and maybe gets to meet them.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t that be interesting,</p>
<p>if a Snapdragon is the thing that first sees an alien?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what the hell?</p>
<p>We did not program this in the computer vision.</p>
<p>I once used the example to go back</p>
<p>to the conversation we had about quality.</p>
<p>As an engineer, you need to make sure it works.</p>
<p>Can you imagine if it gets over there on Mars</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t work?</p>
<p>Listen, this is very stressful.</p>
<p>What NASA, what SpaceX, what all those companies are doing</p>
<p>is extremely stressful.</p>
<p>The room for mistakes is tiny.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s super exciting for an engineer, once again.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a global semiconductor chip shortage.</p>
<p>So from your perspective, just it&rsquo;d be interesting</p>
<p>to get your expert analysis of the situation.</p>
<p>What do you think are the main reasons</p>
<p>and how has Qualcomm been affected and how can it help?</p>
<p>In this, in the future, things like it.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s a big topic of conversation.</p>
<p>And we only have five minutes.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll try to be as objective as I can.</p>
<p>So first, let&rsquo;s talk about what caused it.</p>
<p>And you hear a lot of different things.</p>
<p>I will try to put it within the right context.</p>
<p>The first thing that caused it, really,</p>
<p>is the acceleration of digital transformation</p>
<p>of pretty much everything in every industry.</p>
<p>Every industry has been digitally transformed.</p>
<p>And as such, the amount of semiconductors</p>
<p>that are required is much larger.</p>
<p>Just to give you a practical example,</p>
<p>if you think about the automotive as an example,</p>
<p>the cars that are, there&rsquo;s cars that are launched,</p>
<p>a new model launching today.</p>
<p>The new model launching today most likely has 10X</p>
<p>the amount of chips of the prior model.</p>
<p>And the model that people are working on</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming in next, probably 10X that one.</p>
<p>So you see the amount of silicon</p>
<p>and then billions of things become smart.</p>
<p>More and more data goes to the cloud.</p>
<p>The data center grows.</p>
<p>So the floor for semiconductor consumptions went up by a lot.</p>
<p>Then you have things that aggravated this.</p>
<p>The pandemic aggravated this.</p>
<p>There is a couple of trends from the pandemic.</p>
<p>The enterprise transformation of the home.</p>
<p>The home became an enterprise.</p>
<p>Massive amounts of upgrades on broadband and IoT.</p>
<p>The office has changed to the way we work now,</p>
<p>including the ability to support collaboration tools</p>
<p>and video.</p>
<p>Then you have the higher demand for products</p>
<p>during the pandemic because people wanted to be connected.</p>
<p>People bought new phones and new tablets</p>
<p>and new computers, new gaming.</p>
<p>So all of those things came on top of that</p>
<p>as the aggravated issue, but they&rsquo;re not the main issue.</p>
<p>The main issue is it&rsquo;s actually a long term growth</p>
<p>of digital.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m hearing you say is the pandemic</p>
<p>was not the cause, it was an aggravation.</p>
<p>It was an aggravation.</p>
<p>So is there a way we can support as a human civilization</p>
<p>in terms of manufacture, in terms of supply,</p>
<p>the kind of growth that you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>in devices and so on?</p>
<p>Is there high level ideas you can say</p>
<p>of what that&rsquo;s required there?</p>
<p>Yes, and I think that&rsquo;s the second part of the answer.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s happening now?</p>
<p>How are we gonna get out of this?</p>
<p>So we see a lot of capacity investments</p>
<p>put into place by the industry.</p>
<p>We had invested a lot with our suppliers.</p>
<p>A lot of the suppliers had made plans</p>
<p>about increasing the capacity.</p>
<p>The industry is planning to double</p>
<p>its total semiconductor manufacturing capacity</p>
<p>within the next five years, an example.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s already happening.</p>
<p>And then you see things which are actually good.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>The initiative such as the United States CHIPS Act</p>
<p>and now the European CHIPS Act.</p>
<p>The United States CHIPS Act&rsquo;s about $52 billion.</p>
<p>The European&rsquo;s about 43.</p>
<p>Their goal combined is to get at least 50%</p>
<p>of the consumption with manufacturing installed</p>
<p>within the US and European geographies.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also very good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s yet another incentive for more manufacturing capacity</p>
<p>to be built and to be built</p>
<p>with a geographic distributed way,</p>
<p>which that&rsquo;s how you plan supply chain.</p>
<p>So those I think are good things.</p>
<p>So if anything we learn through the crisis</p>
<p>is that semiconductor is important.</p>
<p>Semiconductor companies are important</p>
<p>and we need to invest in semiconductors.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re turning to the grilling of the CEO</p>
<p>with the hard questions.</p>
<p>This is almost from my own education of the space.</p>
<p>You mentioned regulators.</p>
<p>Qualcomm paid out and received payment</p>
<p>of billions of dollars in settlement and fines.</p>
<p>There seems to be a lot of huge lawsuits in this space.</p>
<p>How do you explain that?</p>
<p>Does this get in the way of innovation</p>
<p>or does it promote it?</p>
<p>I will rephrase it by saying there used to be a lot</p>
<p>of lawsuits in this space.</p>
<p>In addition of what we do in semiconductors,</p>
<p>our processors and our modems, the Snapdragon platform,</p>
<p>we also have a licensing business,</p>
<p>which has been a part of the company since the beginning.</p>
<p>As the largest inventors of the essential technology</p>
<p>in 2G, CDMA, 3G, 4G and 5G,</p>
<p>and Qualcomm contribute that to the standards.</p>
<p>So we always had this model that rather than invent</p>
<p>the technology and be the only one producing the products,</p>
<p>we license so everyone can produce it.</p>
<p>And as such, we receive intellectual property</p>
<p>for the standard essential patents.</p>
<p>As part of our past dispute with Apple,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s behind us now.</p>
<p>Your friends now.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re my customers.</p>
<p>And as part of that, I think the licensing model</p>
<p>got tested, I think, in every geography.</p>
<p>And we succeeded in every single geography</p>
<p>to validate the pro competitiveness of this model.</p>
<p>I think the fair, reasonable,</p>
<p>non discriminatory aspect of this model.</p>
<p>And I would argue that besides being the most successful</p>
<p>licensing business to date in the industry,</p>
<p>probably the one that&rsquo;s been battle tested</p>
<p>and is most stable because there&rsquo;s not a single</p>
<p>jurisdiction that we have not had to validate that model.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s part of our past and what it creates</p>
<p>is probably create a lot of stability</p>
<p>in our licensing business.</p>
<p>But having said that, the growth of the company</p>
<p>is in the semiconductor space.</p>
<p>And the semiconductor, so licensing is,</p>
<p>you come up with a pretty good idea,</p>
<p>you have a bunch of smart people coming up with cool ideas,</p>
<p>and then once you come up with that idea,</p>
<p>you sell that idea to others, they get to use it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s essentially what a license.</p>
<p>The license revenue we have is for the,</p>
<p>what we call the SCP, standard essential patents,</p>
<p>that are part of the 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G standards.</p>
<p>So if you want to build anything with 5G,</p>
<p>you need to get a license from Qualcomm</p>
<p>because it uses Qualcomm essential technology</p>
<p>as part of the standard.</p>
<p>And a slightly different model,</p>
<p>or a lot different model with the semiconductor</p>
<p>is you design, you inject a bunch of fascinating ideas,</p>
<p>how to build the Snapdragon, and then there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a fabulous company,</p>
<p>you have somebody build the chip</p>
<p>and then goes into a phone with the branding</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And that has less kind of players involved,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a license.</p>
<p>We sell the product.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t license semiconductor technology,</p>
<p>we build products and we sell products.</p>
<p>This is your first year as a CEO.</p>
<p>Not one year yet.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope it&rsquo;ll be in June, it&rsquo;ll be one year.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This is a company that&rsquo;s involved</p>
<p>with a lot of fascinating technologies</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s touching the lives of billions of people.</p>
<p>A lot of complicated stuff.</p>
<p>Like I said, licensing technologies.</p>
<p>You have to collaborate with manufacturers.</p>
<p>You have to then work with, however many you said,</p>
<p>car companies and all these clients and so on.</p>
<p>And you have to, with tech companies, Apple and so on.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that like?</p>
<p>What lessons have you learned about leadership</p>
<p>and maybe about yourself as a human being</p>
<p>from this first, almost a year, soon to be a year</p>
<p>as a CEO of this incredible, this complex,</p>
<p>this large company?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a loaded question.</p>
<p>Let me answer in reverse order.</p>
<p>First thing that I learned, and I think it&rsquo;s probably common</p>
<p>across CEOs, especially in our industry,</p>
<p>is it will be great if I had more time.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s, especially because we grow</p>
<p>in so many areas and there&rsquo;s so many things to learn,</p>
<p>so many relationships to build, time to spend</p>
<p>with a number of different technologies.</p>
<p>But it kind of reflects really the size</p>
<p>of the opportunity that exists for Qualcomm.</p>
<p>Qualcomm, it is really growing in a number</p>
<p>of different directions all at the same time.</p>
<p>And so it did got busier.</p>
<p>And part of this is because I&rsquo;m spending a lot of time</p>
<p>understanding the new industries we&rsquo;re going in</p>
<p>and building relationships.</p>
<p>Second thing, which is a lot to do</p>
<p>with how I think about things</p>
<p>and a little bit of my personality.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, business partnerships</p>
<p>are really done by people.</p>
<p>And I think the importance of having trusted relationships</p>
<p>for the long term is extremely important.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been dedicated to do that as CEO.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not a company that plays for the short term.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And when we build new partnerships,</p>
<p>we expect that to be for decades.</p>
<p>And so I spend time doing that</p>
<p>and think that&rsquo;s important for Qualcomm.</p>
<p>The other part of your question is,</p>
<p>we do have a lot of opportunities in all different areas.</p>
<p>What we like, and I&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough</p>
<p>to become CEO at a time,</p>
<p>that a lot of the trends are pointing to our technology.</p>
<p>We talk about some of them.</p>
<p>We talk about merger of physical and digital spaces.</p>
<p>We talk about the transformation of the automobile.</p>
<p>We talk about the merge of computing and mobile,</p>
<p>the enterprise transformation of the home.</p>
<p>There are many of those trends.</p>
<p>And those trends create opportunities for Qualcomm</p>
<p>to be providing technology first.</p>
<p>And as such, we&rsquo;re in a hurry.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m in a little bit of a hurry</p>
<p>because I think the opportunity is incredible</p>
<p>for technology, but having fun and enjoying the job.</p>
<p>Is there a burden because of so much</p>
<p>of what you said is partnerships</p>
<p>and almost like friendships,</p>
<p>connections with other human beings?</p>
<p>Me as an introvert that has a lot of social anxiety,</p>
<p>that seems extremely stressful.</p>
<p>So is there that burden on your shoulders?</p>
<p>You have to wake up every day</p>
<p>and talk to friends you&rsquo;ve had for many years.</p>
<p>It can be, and then convince them</p>
<p>and make partnerships with them,</p>
<p>talk with them, describe to them the future,</p>
<p>sell them an idea, and then yourself grow</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t know what the heck</p>
<p>the future is gonna be like.</p>
<p>And you have to project both confidence and humility,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Is that exhausting?</p>
<p>It is exhausting, but it&rsquo;s something I do like to do.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not only with partners, really.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also internally to your employees, I think,</p>
<p>to get alignment on the vision</p>
<p>and faith in the vision and execute.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day, we&rsquo;re very fortunate.</p>
<p>We have a lot of smart people.</p>
<p>So people, if they&rsquo;re aligned with the vision,</p>
<p>they know what to do.</p>
<p>And then, of course, as CEO,</p>
<p>you have to convince your investors</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s the right idea as well.</p>
<p>If you can put on your wise sage hat,</p>
<p>do you have a device for young people</p>
<p>in high school and college?</p>
<p>You yourself started from the humble beginnings in Brazil,</p>
<p>maybe a bit of a wild, risky decision to go to Japan,</p>
<p>and now are the head of one of the biggest,</p>
<p>most successful, most impactful companies in the world.</p>
<p>Given that story, can you give advice to young people today</p>
<p>that they can have a career</p>
<p>or just a life they can be proud of?</p>
<p>I think the first thing,</p>
<p>and of course, all of those answers</p>
<p>are gonna relate to my own experience, right?</p>
<p>The first thing is it always worked for me</p>
<p>to have a plan, even if the plan</p>
<p>is just what I&rsquo;m gonna do in the next two years,</p>
<p>but what do I want to do?</p>
<p>Where do I wanna go?</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s important for people,</p>
<p>especially young people,</p>
<p>is to really have a dream and go pursue it.</p>
<p>I mean, have a dream does not go back to bed to sleep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really what do you want to accomplish</p>
<p>and then what it&rsquo;s gonna take to do that.</p>
<p>And then believe in yourself.</p>
<p>Like I said, I joined Qualcomm as an engineer</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t have any plans when I joined to be CEO,</p>
<p>but I do want, as an engineer,</p>
<p>what I wanted to do, where I wanna contribute,</p>
<p>what I wanted to work on,</p>
<p>and then keep evolving from that point in time.</p>
<p>The other thing is, this is an advice,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more of like career advice that I got early in my career</p>
<p>was extremely helpful for me</p>
<p>and I will give that advice</p>
<p>to everyone that is interested.</p>
<p>Spend time understanding what are the things you&rsquo;re good at</p>
<p>and what are the things you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Like what is the real border between your area of competence</p>
<p>and your area of incompetence?</p>
<p>And once you see that,</p>
<p>once you see that you know exactly what you have to work on</p>
<p>and you can say, that&rsquo;s where I wanna go next,</p>
<p>this is the gap, I need to do it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s faster when you can identify yourself</p>
<p>before other people can tell you.</p>
<p>Then it leads to automatically the next step.</p>
<p>Surround yourself, the people that are very good</p>
<p>at the things that you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>So you have to be radically honest</p>
<p>about the things that you&rsquo;re not good at,</p>
<p>but given what you&rsquo;re passionate about,</p>
<p>you need to get good at,</p>
<p>or you would like to get good at,</p>
<p>and surround yourself by those people.</p>
<p>How often did the plans you make actually work out?</p>
<p>So you said it&rsquo;s important to make plans.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t say anything about</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important to execute on those plans.</p>
<p>More than 50% success rate.</p>
<p>Try to keep it above 50.</p>
<p>What was the whole, why did you end up in Japan?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to work in cellular and wireless</p>
<p>my entire career.</p>
<p>So I always liked communications.</p>
<p>When I entered engineering school,</p>
<p>my dad was electrical engineer,</p>
<p>but he worked with the utility company.</p>
<p>He wanted me to graduate</p>
<p>in traditional electrical engineering,</p>
<p>like energy generation, distribution.</p>
<p>But I like electronics communication,</p>
<p>so I ended up doing both.</p>
<p>And I always liked communication.</p>
<p>I was fascinated by wireless communication.</p>
<p>So my first job at a college,</p>
<p>I started working for a Japanese company down in Brazil,</p>
<p>was NEC, and within about a year in,</p>
<p>they transferred me to Tokyo.</p>
<p>They asked me to go to their headquarters,</p>
<p>and it was the first time I left Brazil.</p>
<p>A little bit different from Brazil.</p>
<p>Culturally. Very different.</p>
<p>It is in the other side of the planet.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how I started.</p>
<p>You said your father&rsquo;s an electrical engineer.</p>
<p>Do you think what you&rsquo;re doing now makes your father proud?</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s very proud.</p>
<p>I think especially, you know,</p>
<p>he tells me that I&rsquo;m still the same person</p>
<p>that never changed.</p>
<p>Does he give you advice?</p>
<p>Does he criticize what you&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<p>Tell you how to improve?</p>
<p>My mom and dad still give me advice today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very fortunate for that.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s proud.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also proud because there are very few Brazilians</p>
<p>that have achieved a position as CEO</p>
<p>of a company the size of Qualcomm.</p>
<p>And I do know that also I carry a burden,</p>
<p>especially for the Latino community,</p>
<p>to be an inspiration for them</p>
<p>and make sure I set a good example.</p>
<p>So not just your mom and dad,</p>
<p>but the culture, the people that were originally your home.</p>
<p>Do you, you know, life is finite.</p>
<p>Do you think about your own mortality?</p>
<p>Look, I&rsquo;m a devout Christian,</p>
<p>and so I&rsquo;m a big believer that there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>this is just a transition.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t spend a lot of time thinking about that.</p>
<p>I am somebody good, better, and different</p>
<p>that try as much as possible to leave the present,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what I do.</p>
<p>And try to make the present better</p>
<p>on this place here on Earth.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And that some of these technologies,</p>
<p>some of these ideas are kind of a different kind</p>
<p>of immortality as well,</p>
<p>because they propagate through time</p>
<p>and have impact on people in the best possible way.</p>
<p>So technology can be scary,</p>
<p>technology can be destructive,</p>
<p>but it seems like in the end it can do a lot of good.</p>
<p>More good, there&rsquo;s more good than bad.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?</p>
<p>I asked you about aliens observing us.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Cristiano, what&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Easy questions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not an easy question at all.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a question,</p>
<p>at least for me, you have to answer individually.</p>
<p>But I do believe we&rsquo;re all here for a purpose.</p>
<p>In my prayers I always ask that I stay on track</p>
<p>to whatever my purpose is,</p>
<p>but I do believe we&rsquo;re here for a purpose,</p>
<p>and we need to do the best we can</p>
<p>during the time we have on this Earth.</p>
<p>So that means create beautiful things for you</p>
<p>as an engineer?</p>
<p>Yes, and create beautiful things, yes.</p>
<p>What about love?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of love in the human condition?</p>
<p>Love&rsquo;s very important,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an essential part of being human.</p>
<p>It comes in the package.</p>
<p>And I think if you look at the situation,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening right now,</p>
<p>I think if you look at the situation</p>
<p>with some of the underprivileged communities,</p>
<p>you look at the homeless situation,</p>
<p>I think we all need more love.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think people that build incredible technology</p>
<p>sometimes forget the love part.</p>
<p>Those are all, it&rsquo;s all integrated.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, thinking about humanity is really important</p>
<p>when you build tools that empower that humanity.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s, I think, at least I personally believe</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all capable of both evil and good.</p>
<p>And we have to build technology, build societies,</p>
<p>build governments, build communities</p>
<p>that inspire us to connect with the good part</p>
<p>within all of us.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big believer that technology is, at the end,</p>
<p>the force for good.</p>
<p>And if you just look, you know,</p>
<p>not trying to move away from a deep discussion</p>
<p>to a more specific, technical one.</p>
<p>But we started a conversation talking about smartphones.</p>
<p>And smartphones really, the first time</p>
<p>that you could say that everybody in the world</p>
<p>was able to connect to the internet</p>
<p>and connect to each other.</p>
<p>And I think what that empowerment that that provided,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an incredible force for good.</p>
<p>Well, the company you lead, the technology you&rsquo;ve created,</p>
<p>one of them that I&rsquo;m especially excited about,</p>
<p>which is Snapdragon, the whole line of processors there.</p>
<p>Currently, I would say at about 10 billion transistors.</p>
<p>If you think about the human brain,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about 100 billion neurons.</p>
<p>So I think 11 Samsung Galaxy S22s</p>
<p>are already smarter than me.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s being nice to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really honored that you spent</p>
<p>your extremely valuable time with me,</p>
<p>even though you said Pele is the favorite player.</p>
<p>Beyond all of that, I think you&rsquo;re an incredible person,</p>
<p>incredible leader, and you lead</p>
<p>an incredible engineering company.</p>
<p>So thank you for doing that.</p>
<p>Oh, thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thanks for the kind words.</p>
<p>Really a pleasure having this conversation.</p>
<p>I really had a lot of fun doing it.</p>
<p>And thank you for having me in your podcast.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Christiano Aman.</p>
<p>To support this podcast, please check out</p>
<p>our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Stephen Hawking.</p>
<p>For millions of years, mankind lived just like the animals.</p>
<p>Then something happened, which unleashed</p>
<p>the power of our imagination.</p>
<p>We learned to talk, and we learned to listen.</p>
<p>Speech has allowed the communication of ideas,</p>
<p>enabling human beings to work together</p>
<p>to build the impossible.</p>
<p>Mankind&rsquo;s greatest achievements have come about by talking,</p>
<p>and its greatest failures by not talking.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be like this.</p>
<p>Our greatest hopes could become reality in the future.</p>
<p>With the technology at our disposal,</p>
<p>the possibilities are unbounded.</p>
<p>All we need to do is make sure we keep talking.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
