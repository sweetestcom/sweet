    <p>If you could talk to Vladimir Putin once again now,</p>
<p>what kind of things would you talk about here?</p>
<p>What kind of questions would you ask?</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Oliver Stone.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the greatest filmmakers of all time</p>
<p>with three Oscar wins and 11 Oscar nominations.</p>
<p>His films tell stories of war and power,</p>
<p>fearlessly and often controversially,</p>
<p>shining a light on the dark parts</p>
<p>of American and global history.</p>
<p>His films include Platoon, Wall Street,</p>
<p>Born on the 4th of July, Scarface, JFK,</p>
<p>Nixon, Alexander, W, Snowden,</p>
<p>and documentaries where he has interviewed</p>
<p>some of the most powerful and consequential people</p>
<p>in the world, including Fidel Castro,</p>
<p>Hugo Chavez, and Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>And in this conversation, Oliver and I</p>
<p>mostly focus our discussion on Vladimir Putin,</p>
<p>Russia, and the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>My goal with these conversations</p>
<p>is to understand the human being before me,</p>
<p>to understand not just what they think,</p>
<p>but how they think, to steel man their ideas,</p>
<p>and to steel man the devil&rsquo;s advocate,</p>
<p>all in service of understanding, not derision.</p>
<p>I have done this poorly in the past.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still struggling with this,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m working hard to do better.</p>
<p>I believe the moment we draw lines</p>
<p>between good people and evil people</p>
<p>will lose our ability to see that we&rsquo;re all one people</p>
<p>in the most fundamental of ways,</p>
<p>and will lose track of the deep truth</p>
<p>expressed by the old Solzhenitsyn line</p>
<p>that I return to time and time again,</p>
<p>that the line between good and evil</p>
<p>runs through the heart of every man.</p>
<p>Oliver Stone has a perspective</p>
<p>that he extensively documents</p>
<p>in his powerful controversial series,</p>
<p>The Untold History of the United States,</p>
<p>that imperialism and the military industrial complex</p>
<p>paved the path to absolute power,</p>
<p>and thus corrupt the minds of the leaders</p>
<p>and institutions that wield it.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the way out</p>
<p>of the humanitarian crisis and human suffering in Ukraine,</p>
<p>and the way out from the pull</p>
<p>of the beating drums of nuclear war</p>
<p>is not simple to understand,</p>
<p>but we must, because all of humanity hangs in the balance.</p>
<p>I will talk to many people who seek to understand</p>
<p>the way out of this growing catastrophe,</p>
<p>including to historians, to leaders,</p>
<p>and perhaps most importantly,</p>
<p>to people on the ground in Ukraine and Russia,</p>
<p>not just about war and suffering,</p>
<p>but about life, friendship, family, love, and hope.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>

<p>in the description, and now, dear friends,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s Oliver Stone.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re working on a documentary now about nuclear energy.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting to talk about this.</p>
<p>Energy is such a big part of the world,</p>
<p>about geopolitics of the world,</p>
<p>about the way the world is.</p>
<p>What do you think is the role of nuclear energy</p>
<p>in the 21st century?</p>
<p>Good question, and first of all,</p>
<p>obviously everyone&rsquo;s talking about climate change, right?</p>
<p>So here I wake up to that a few years ago,</p>
<p>and clearly were concerned.</p>
<p>I picked up a book by Josh Goldstein</p>
<p>and his coauthor, who&rsquo;s Swedish.</p>
<p>Those two wrote a book called A Bright Future.</p>
<p>It came out a few years ago, and I lapped it up.</p>
<p>It was a book, fact based, clear,</p>
<p>not too long, and not too technical,</p>
<p>and it was very clear that they were in favor</p>
<p>of all kinds of renewables, renewable energy, yes.</p>
<p>They made it very clear how dangerous oil</p>
<p>and gas were, methane,</p>
<p>and made it very clear to the layman like me,</p>
<p>and at the same time said that these renewables</p>
<p>could work so far, but the gap is enormous</p>
<p>as to how much electricity the world is gonna need</p>
<p>in 2050 and beyond, two, three, four times.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even know the damage, but we have India,</p>
<p>we have China, we have Africa, we have Asia</p>
<p>coming onto the scene wanting more and more electricity.</p>
<p>So they address the problem as a global one,</p>
<p>not just as often in the United States.</p>
<p>You get the ethnocentric United States point of view</p>
<p>that we know we&rsquo;re doing well, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not doing well, but we sell that</p>
<p>to people that we&rsquo;re comfortable.</p>
<p>We spend more energy than anybody,</p>
<p>this country per capita, than anybody,</p>
<p>and at the same time, we don&rsquo;t seem to understand</p>
<p>the global picture, so that&rsquo;s what they did,</p>
<p>and they made me very worried.</p>
<p>So the only way to close that gap,</p>
<p>the only way in their mind is nuclear energy,</p>
<p>and talking about a gap of building a huge amount</p>
<p>of reactors over the next 30 years,</p>
<p>and starting now, they make that point over and over again.</p>
<p>So obviously this country, the United States,</p>
<p>is not gonna go in that direction,</p>
<p>because it just is incapable of having that kind of will,</p>
<p>political will, and fear is a huge factor,</p>
<p>and still a lot of shibboleths, a lot of myths</p>
<p>about nuclear energy have confused</p>
<p>and confounded the landscape.</p>
<p>The environmentalists have played a huge role</p>
<p>in doing good things, many good things,</p>
<p>but also confusing and confounding the landscape,</p>
<p>and making accusations against nuclear energy</p>
<p>that were exaggerated.</p>
<p>So taking all these things into consideration,</p>
<p>we set about making this documentary,</p>
<p>which is about finished now, almost finishing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an hour and 40 minutes, and that was a hard part,</p>
<p>getting it down from about three and a half hours</p>
<p>to about this, something more manageable,</p>
<p>and is it interviews?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interviews, among others,</p>
<p>but essentially we went to Russia, we went to France,</p>
<p>which is the most, perhaps, advanced nuclear country</p>
<p>in the world, Russia, and the United States.</p>
<p>We went to the Idaho laboratory,</p>
<p>and talked to the scientists there,</p>
<p>as well as the Department of Energy people</p>
<p>that are handling this.</p>
<p>Idaho is one of the experimental labs,</p>
<p>the United States is probably one of the most advanced,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re doing a lot of advanced nuclear there.</p>
<p>We also, we studied, well, Russia gave us a lot of insight.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very cooperative,</p>
<p>because they have some of the most advanced nuclear,</p>
<p>actually the probably most advanced nuclear reactor</p>
<p>in the world, at Beloyarsk, at the Ural Mountains.</p>
<p>So we did an investigation there,</p>
<p>and in France they have some very advanced nuclear reactors</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re building, and now they&rsquo;re building again.</p>
<p>The Green Party came into power,</p>
<p>just not into power, but became a factor in France,</p>
<p>and there was a motion when Hollande was president,</p>
<p>they started to move away from it.</p>
<p>Actually, they were beginning to just abandon,</p>
<p>they let, not complete, in other words,</p>
<p>close down some of the nuclear reactors,</p>
<p>there was talk of that, but thank God,</p>
<p>France did not do that, and Macron came in</p>
<p>and recently reversed it, reversed it,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re building as fast as they can now,</p>
<p>especially with the Ukraine war going on,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an awareness that Russia will not be providing,</p>
<p>may not be providing the energy Europe needs.</p>
<p>So, and then China is the other one too,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the other factor, I&rsquo;m talking about the big boys.</p>
<p>They have, doing tremendous work and fast,</p>
<p>which is very hopeful, but of course,</p>
<p>China is building in all directions at once,</p>
<p>coal continues to be huge in China,</p>
<p>and methane too,</p>
<p>but basically coal, coal in India, in China,</p>
<p>have the biggest users of coal,</p>
<p>and as you know, Germany went back to coal a few years ago,</p>
<p>so all these factors, it&rsquo;s a fascinating picture globally,</p>
<p>so we try to achieve a consensus that where nuclear can work</p>
<p>and where it will be working,</p>
<p>where it will be used more and more,</p>
<p>the question is how much carbon dioxide China</p>
<p>and Russia will be putting out.</p>
<p>France is the only one that&rsquo;s not putting it out.</p>
<p>The United States has not changed,</p>
<p>with all the talk and all the nonsense about renewables</p>
<p>and the new lifestyle and all this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s great for your guilt complex,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t do anything for the total accumulation</p>
<p>of carbon dioxide in the world.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s gonna lead the way on nuclear, do you think?</p>
<p>You mentioned Russia, France, China, United States,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s gonna lead?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>a United Nations kind of thing,</p>
<p>because the world doesn&rsquo;t seem capable of uniting.</p>
<p>We go to these conferences, Kyoto,</p>
<p>and we talk and we agree,</p>
<p>but then we don&rsquo;t actually enforce,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t think it can happen that way.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gonna be an individual race with countries.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna just do it for their own self interest,</p>
<p>like China&rsquo;s doing it.</p>
<p>China, the thing is, if it works, and I&rsquo;m praying</p>
<p>that it will really work on a big scale,</p>
<p>China will back away from coal naturally.</p>
<p>The same thing will be true of India.</p>
<p>They will see the benefits, because if you go to India,</p>
<p>you see the cities, the pollution.</p>
<p>You walk around in that stuff, and you get,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not, there&rsquo;s no hope in this, and you sense it.</p>
<p>So people will move in this direction naturally,</p>
<p>because nuclear is clean energy.</p>
<p>And the amount of casualties of nuclear</p>
<p>is the lowest on the industrial scale</p>
<p>for energy producing, from coal down to oil, everything.</p>
<p>The lowest casualty rate, very lowest,</p>
<p>.002 or something, is nuclear.</p>
<p>So not that many people have died from nuclear.</p>
<p>Not that many, I think 50 people at Chernobyl,</p>
<p>which was the worst accident.</p>
<p>Nobody had died at Fukushima.</p>
<p>Nobody died at Three Mile Island,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what you hear all over and over again,</p>
<p>these accidents.</p>
<p>The environmentalists have sold us the idea</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re dangerous.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, a lot of environmentalists, thank God,</p>
<p>are changing, they&rsquo;ve come off that routine,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve saying, this, we were wrong.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done a lot of good work.</p>
<p>Greenpeace did a lot of good work.</p>
<p>Whale, whales, saving this, saving that.</p>
<p>But they admit themselves, not they don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but people who have been in the organization</p>
<p>have said, we were wrong.</p>
<p>In 1956, we show the articles</p>
<p>in the New York Times that came out,</p>
<p>the Rockefeller Foundation,</p>
<p>which of course is a big producer of oil,</p>
<p>the Rockefeller family, and the foundation came out</p>
<p>with a study, which was weighted.</p>
<p>They tipped the scale, put a thumb on the scale,</p>
<p>but it was a scientific expose of radiation</p>
<p>in the study that came out, printed in the New York Times,</p>
<p>because the New York Times publisher, Salzburger,</p>
<p>was on their board, he was one of the board members.</p>
<p>So they got a lot of strong publicity</p>
<p>condemning radiation, which killed,</p>
<p>started the process of doubting nuclear energy.</p>
<p>The radiation levels that they pointed out</p>
<p>were very minor, and of course,</p>
<p>if you go into a scientific analysis of this now</p>
<p>with what we know, it&rsquo;s just not true.</p>
<p>But it tilted the scale back in the 50s, 60s,</p>
<p>and started the questioning the nuclear business.</p>
<p>Do you think that was malevolence or incompetence?</p>
<p>No, I think it was competition.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it was conspiracy</p>
<p>as much as it was essentially,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t want this, nuclear energy&rsquo;s gonna end</p>
<p>the dominance of oil, absolutely, and it will.</p>
<p>And it will anyway, because it&rsquo;s the only sane way</p>
<p>for the world to proceed.</p>
<p>But the world will have to learn through adversity.</p>
<p>So in other words, this situation could get worse,</p>
<p>much worse, and certain countries</p>
<p>are just gonna have to adapt, like we always do.</p>
<p>When things become too hard, you&rsquo;ve got to go,</p>
<p>you have to change your thinking.</p>
<p>And humans are pretty good at that.</p>
<p>Yes, talking about human nature, they&rsquo;re very adept</p>
<p>at that, Germany, for example.</p>
<p>I mean, they were, when the Fukushima happened,</p>
<p>they went out of the nuclear business.</p>
<p>That was shocking to me.</p>
<p>They just pulled out and they destroyed,</p>
<p>destructed several of their nuclear reactors</p>
<p>who were still functioning, and put up coal,</p>
<p>or yeah, put up coal and oil, replaced it.</p>
<p>And as a result, Germany drifted into this place</p>
<p>next to France, their electricity bills went up,</p>
<p>and France stayed the same.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have that, they have a different system</p>
<p>in Europe, but more or less, no question that France</p>
<p>was doing a lot better than Germany.</p>
<p>And now, with this Ukraine issue,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very interesting fulcrum point,</p>
<p>whether Germany is, what direction they&rsquo;re gonna go now.</p>
<p>How can they, how can they keep going with coal?</p>
<p>They just can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the connection between oil, coal, nuclear, and war?</p>
<p>Sort of energy and conflict.</p>
<p>When you look at the 21st century,</p>
<p>when you were doing this documentary,</p>
<p>were you thinking of nuclear as a way to power the world,</p>
<p>but is it also to avoid conflict over resources?</p>
<p>Is there some aspect to energy being a source of conflict</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re trying to avoid?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the energy, the history of energy</p>
<p>at my fingertips, and it&rsquo;s a very long history here.</p>
<p>But I would say, apparently not.</p>
<p>It does seem that individually, each country</p>
<p>can answer its needs by building.</p>
<p>And up until now, we haven&rsquo;t had conflict,</p>
<p>except in this issue of Russia supplying Europe.</p>
<p>Obviously, the pipeline, Nord Stream 2 has been closed,</p>
<p>and Nord Stream 1 is also probably gonna be phased out.</p>
<p>And the concept of Russia supplying gas to Europe</p>
<p>is now up in the air, and who knows what&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t see how Europe can get away</p>
<p>from using Russian gas.</p>
<p>But Russian gas is not the solution,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s methane, too, and it goes up</p>
<p>into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Methane, in the short term, is worse than coal, worse.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all kinds of charts we show in the film.</p>
<p>We try not to be too overfactual,</p>
<p>but methane is not the answer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a short term answer.</p>
<p>Will countries go to war over energy is a question</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m trying to think of all the wars that happened.</p>
<p>You could say Germany, of course, during World War II</p>
<p>needed oil very badly, and it dictated their strategy</p>
<p>with Romania, et cetera, and getting the oil fields open.</p>
<p>But I haven&rsquo;t thought that one through.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d have to make a documentary on it</p>
<p>to really understand how energy and war interface.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always part of the calculation,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a question of how much.</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s the question.</p>
<p>I just have to ask, because you mentioned</p>
<p>your mom was from France, you&rsquo;ve traveled</p>
<p>for this documentary, and you traveled in general</p>
<p>throughout the world in Russia, Ukraine.</p>
<p>What are the defining characteristics of these cultures?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go with Russia.</p>
<p>So as I told you, I&rsquo;m half Ukrainian, half Russian.</p>
<p>I came from that part of the world.</p>
<p>What are some interesting, beautiful aspects</p>
<p>of the culture of Russia and Ukraine?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t really speak honestly of Ukraine.</p>
<p>I was there only in 1983 when I visited</p>
<p>the Soviet Union under the communism,</p>
<p>and Kiev was beautiful and was one of the nicer places</p>
<p>I went, but they were very much stultified</p>
<p>by the communist system, they all were.</p>
<p>The best places to visit in Russia were always in the South,</p>
<p>whether Georgia or the Muslim countries,</p>
<p>it was always a better culture in terms of comfort.</p>
<p>But communism was rough, and that was the end of it,</p>
<p>pretty much Brezhnev regime, and then Andropov.</p>
<p>Gorbachev was three years in the future when I was there.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t talk about Ukraine, and they&rsquo;ve not been friendly</p>
<p>to me since ISIS, of course, since I made</p>
<p>the Putin interviews, you know, Ukraine has banned me,</p>
<p>I believe, they&rsquo;ve been very tough on people</p>
<p>who are critical.</p>
<p>I think the Russian people have been very special to me,</p>
<p>and perhaps because of my European upbringing,</p>
<p>but I enjoy talking to them, I find them very open,</p>
<p>very generous, and they appreciate support,</p>
<p>they appreciate people who say, you know,</p>
<p>I understand why your government is doing this</p>
<p>or this or this, I&rsquo;ve tried to stay open minded</p>
<p>and listen to both sides.</p>
<p>The thing that I have seen as an American is, of course,</p>
<p>this American enmity towards Russia from the very beginning.</p>
<p>I grew up in 1940, 46, I was born in the 50s,</p>
<p>it was so anti Russian, they were everywhere,</p>
<p>they were in our schools, they were in our State Department,</p>
<p>they were spying on us, they were stealing the country</p>
<p>from us, that was the way the American right wing,</p>
<p>not even the right wing, I&rsquo;d say the Republican party,</p>
<p>pictured the Russians, they were actively engaged</p>
<p>in infiltrating America and changing our thinking.</p>
<p>And television shows were based on this,</p>
<p>it was very much the J. Edgar Hoover mentality</p>
<p>that communism was even behind the student protests</p>
<p>of the 1960s, this was the direction in which the FBI</p>
<p>and the CIA were thinking.</p>
<p>So I grew up with a prejudice, and it took me many years,</p>
<p>my father was a Republican and he was a stockbroker</p>
<p>and he was a very intelligent man, but even he,</p>
<p>because he was a World War II soldier, he was a colonel,</p>
<p>had fallen under the influence.</p>
<p>In order to be successful in American business</p>
<p>in the 1950s, you had to have a very strong</p>
<p>anti Soviet line, very strong, you wouldn&rsquo;t get ahead.</p>
<p>If you expressed any kind of, let&rsquo;s end this Cold War,</p>
<p>any kind of activity of that nature, you&rsquo;d be cast aside</p>
<p>as a pinko or somebody who was not completely</p>
<p>on the board with the American way of doing business,</p>
<p>which was capitalism works, communism doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And in particular, communism was embodied</p>
<p>by the Soviet Union as the enemy.</p>
<p>So hence the narrative behind the Cold War.</p>
<p>Behind the Cold War, that&rsquo;s correct, and it basically</p>
<p>lasted, I mean, you saw the ups and downs of it.</p>
<p>When Reagan came in, I was, well, first of all,</p>
<p>we had the crisis of 1962 with the Cuban Missile Crisis,</p>
<p>and Kennedy proved himself to be a warrior for peace.</p>
<p>He resolved that with Khrushchev.</p>
<p>That was a big moment, huge moment, and people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>give him credit enough for really saving us from a war</p>
<p>that could have affected all of mankind.</p>
<p>But it still didn&rsquo;t avert.</p>
<p>No, because the moment he was killed,</p>
<p>honestly, there was a lot of, we can talk about that,</p>
<p>and as you know, I&rsquo;ve made a film, JFK Revisited</p>
<p>is a documentary we released this year</p>
<p>about the movie I made in 1991.</p>
<p>But the moment he was killed, I would argue</p>
<p>that Lyndon Johnson went back immediately</p>
<p>to the old way of thinking, the old way of doing business,</p>
<p>which was the Eisenhower, Truman way,</p>
<p>which we had adapted since World War II.</p>
<p>That was an interim.</p>
<p>You have to think about it from, Roosevelt dies in 45.</p>
<p>Roosevelt has an interim of 15 years where he,</p>
<p>he has more of a democratic regime, more liberal.</p>
<p>He establishes, he recognizes the Soviet Union</p>
<p>for the first time since the revolution,</p>
<p>and he actually has a relationship with them.</p>
<p>He sends ambassadors who are friendly,</p>
<p>and he has a relationship with Stalin, et cetera,</p>
<p>and at Yalta, or no, at Tehran, rather,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where he had the relationship.</p>
<p>Do you think if JFK lived, we would not have a Cold War?</p>
<p>No, absolutely not, and we go into great depth on that</p>
<p>in the film, and I&rsquo;d urge you to see it,</p>
<p>because it goes into all the issues around the world.</p>
<p>Kennedy was being very much an anti imperialist.</p>
<p>It turns out, and many people just don&rsquo;t understand that,</p>
<p>but you have to look at all his policies in Middle East</p>
<p>with Nasser, he had a relationship with Sukarno in Indonesia,</p>
<p>with Latin America, he made a big effort</p>
<p>with the Alliance for Progress,</p>
<p>and when Africa, above all, with Lumumba,</p>
<p>he was very shocked at his death,</p>
<p>and tried to defend the right, the integrity</p>
<p>of the Belgian Congo with Dag Hammarskjold of the UN.</p>
<p>He made a big effort.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it didn&rsquo;t work out,</p>
<p>because Dag Hammarskjold was killed,</p>
<p>and then Kennedy was killed,</p>
<p>and Congo descended into the chaos</p>
<p>of Joseph Mobutu&rsquo;s dictatorship.</p>
<p>But Kennedy was very active in terms of,</p>
<p>as an Irishman, not as an Englishman, he was an Irishman.</p>
<p>And I say that because, well, we&rsquo;ll come back to that,</p>
<p>because Mr. Joe Biden is an Irishman,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a different kind of an Irishman.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both Catholic Irish, but Kennedy really made</p>
<p>an effort to change the imperialist mindset</p>
<p>that still was very strong in America and Europe.</p>
<p>Lyndon Johnson changed back to the old policy,</p>
<p>and we were never able to really keep</p>
<p>big talk going with the Russians.</p>
<p>Briefly had it with Carter, but then Brzezinski came in.</p>
<p>Brzezinski was his national security advisor.</p>
<p>He was put there by Rockefeller,</p>
<p>and Brzezinski was a Pole, he got revenge from Poland.</p>
<p>Poland has always been attacking Russia,</p>
<p>as far as I remember, back to another century.</p>
<p>I mean, the two world wars that occupied Russia,</p>
<p>so tragically, entry points were always</p>
<p>through Poland and Ukraine.</p>
<p>So Brzezinski got his revenge,</p>
<p>and Carter ended up being an enemy of the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>and creating, as Brzezinski took pride in it,</p>
<p>he created the atmosphere of the trap</p>
<p>for the Soviets to go into Afghanistan in 79.</p>
<p>That trap was set, he says, he said, in 1978.</p>
<p>So there was never, except for brief moments,</p>
<p>periods of detente with the Soviets,</p>
<p>and I grew up under that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really know anything of this going on,</p>
<p>because I was learning, I was educating myself</p>
<p>as I was going, learning movies,</p>
<p>and trying to be a dramatist, and this and that,</p>
<p>so I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about this.</p>
<p>Then, when Reagan came in, I was worried again,</p>
<p>because it was the beat of the old beat,</p>
<p>which was there, the most evil empire.</p>
<p>I mean, it goes on in American history, it doesn&rsquo;t end.</p>
<p>Reagan got a lot of points for that,</p>
<p>and of course, when Gorbachev came in,</p>
<p>it was a beautiful moment for the world.</p>
<p>It was a great surprise.</p>
<p>It was probably the best years for America,</p>
<p>at least from my point of view,</p>
<p>in terms of this relaxation in the mood.</p>
<p>1986 to 1991 were great years</p>
<p>in terms of ability to believe, once again,</p>
<p>that there could be a peace dividend,</p>
<p>but the world changed again in 1991, 92.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an internal mechanism, who knows?</p>
<p>You could blame the United States,</p>
<p>you could blame Russia for&hellip;</p>
<p>Gorbachev was perhaps not the right man</p>
<p>to try to administer that country at that point.</p>
<p>He had great visions, he was a man of peace,</p>
<p>but it was very difficult to hold together</p>
<p>such a huge empire.</p>
<p>So vision is not enough to hold together the Soviet Union?</p>
<p>I think the details are interesting.</p>
<p>I followed up on that a little bit,</p>
<p>because I was recently in countries like Kazakhstan,</p>
<p>talked about the negotiations that were going on,</p>
<p>and the breakup of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very interesting story,</p>
<p>because it involves everything, Ukraine, of course,</p>
<p>everything that&rsquo;s going on now.</p>
<p>Some, what is it, 30 million Russians</p>
<p>were left outside of the Soviet Union when it collapsed.</p>
<p>They had no home anymore, they were homes</p>
<p>in other countries, such as in Ukraine.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an interesting story, and with repercussions today,</p>
<p>Kazakhstan is a good example of keeping a balance,</p>
<p>keeping it neutral.</p>
<p>He played both sides,</p>
<p>and because Yeltsin wanted him</p>
<p>to join the Russian Confederation</p>
<p>in a certain way where he&rsquo;d be supporting,</p>
<p>against Gorbachev, there&rsquo;s a whole inward battle there.</p>
<p>I think the Ukraine came along with Yeltsin,</p>
<p>as well as, I&rsquo;m sorry, I don&rsquo;t remember now,</p>
<p>but two other regions came with him,</p>
<p>and that was a block that broke up the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>It was Yeltsin&rsquo;s plan to,</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t make the Russian Federation, and they did.</p>
<p>I would love to return back to JFK eventually,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s such a fascinating figure</p>
<p>in the history of human civilization,</p>
<p>but let me ask you, fast forward.</p>
<p>In 2000, Yeltsin was no longer president,</p>
<p>and Vladimir Putin became president.</p>
<p>You did a series of interviews with Vladimir Putin,</p>
<p>as you mentioned, over a period of two years,</p>
<p>from 2015 to 2017.</p>
<p>Let me ask with a high level question.</p>
<p>What was your goal with that conversation?</p>
<p>Oh, came out in 2017, I guess I started them in 2014.</p>
<p>At that point, the Snowden affair had happened,</p>
<p>and I was working on a movie on Snowden.</p>
<p>That happened in 13, Ukraine happened in 14,</p>
<p>and one thing after another.</p>
<p>By 14, Putin was enemy number, again,</p>
<p>becoming a wanted man on the American list.</p>
<p>He was enemy, he was certainly in the top five.</p>
<p>But the animosity towards Putin</p>
<p>had been growing since 2007 at Munich.</p>
<p>I remember that speech when he made it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in my documentary, that&rsquo;s a four hour documentary,</p>
<p>four different conversations.</p>
<p>I mean, we talked over two years, two and a half years,</p>
<p>but I remember that image of him at Munich</p>
<p>making a very important speech about world harmony,</p>
<p>about the balance necessary in the world,</p>
<p>and I remember the sneer, the sneer on John McCain&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>He was in Munich, obviously eyeballing Putin</p>
<p>and hating him, and it was so evident</p>
<p>that McCain had no belief whatsoever that this,</p>
<p>he was almost treating him like these are the communists</p>
<p>are back, and we know that Putin was not a communist.</p>
<p>We know that Putin is very much a market man,</p>
<p>and he made it very clear and tried to keep an open climate,</p>
<p>a new relationship with Europe,</p>
<p>but the United States always, certain people</p>
<p>in the United States always saw that as a threat,</p>
<p>like Putin is trying to take Europe away from us</p>
<p>as if we own it, as if we have the right to own it.</p>
<p>But Putin was making the point, it&rsquo;s very important,</p>
<p>about sovereignty, and sovereignty for countries</p>
<p>is crucial for this new world to have balance.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sovereignty for China, sovereignty for Russia,</p>
<p>sovereignty for Iran, sovereignty for Venezuela,</p>
<p>sovereignty for Cuba.</p>
<p>This is an idea that&rsquo;s crucial to the new world,</p>
<p>and I think the United States has never accepted that.</p>
<p>Sovereignty is not an idea that they can allow.</p>
<p>You have to be obedient to the United States idea</p>
<p>of so called democracy and freedom,</p>
<p>but much more important is sovereignty for these countries,</p>
<p>and the United States has not obeyed that,</p>
<p>has not even acknowledged it, and it never comes up.</p>
<p>So from the perspective of the United States,</p>
<p>when power centers arise in the world,</p>
<p>you start to oppose those, not because of the ideas,</p>
<p>but merely because they have power.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that at the heart of the doctrine</p>
<p>of the neoconservatives,</p>
<p>and the pact for the new American century</p>
<p>they wrote down in 1996, seven,</p>
<p>they said there shall be no emergence of a rival power.</p>
<p>It was very clear it was about power,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve stuck to that doctrine,</p>
<p>which is if you start to get dangerous in any way</p>
<p>or have power, we&rsquo;re gonna knock you out.</p>
<p>Now that won&rsquo;t work, and I don&rsquo;t believe it can work,</p>
<p>and that is unfortunately a policy</p>
<p>the United States is following,</p>
<p>and the neoconservatives group, which is very small,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very strong apparently,</p>
<p>and their idea has resonated.</p>
<p>It was behind the George Bush&rsquo;s invasion of Iraq.</p>
<p>It was part of not only Iraq,</p>
<p>but cleaning out the whole world, draining the swamp,</p>
<p>going to Afghanistan first,</p>
<p>and then although Iraq had nothing to do</p>
<p>with al Qaeda&rsquo;s attack, going after Iraq.</p>
<p>And of course 60 some other countries</p>
<p>that were terrorism had some signs of,</p>
<p>wherever America judged would be a dangerous country.</p>
<p>We had the right, you&rsquo;re either with us or against us.</p>
<p>Now that is a disastrous policy,</p>
<p>and led to one thing after another.</p>
<p>The Iraq war never learned a lesson.</p>
<p>The neoconservatives were never fired,</p>
<p>never thrown out of office.</p>
<p>The people who prosecuted that war are still around.</p>
<p>Many of them are still around,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re obviously guiding America now.</p>
<p>Let me return to this question of power.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget the sneer that I saw there.</p>
<p>That emblemized the United States reaction.</p>
<p>Also there were several other American representatives</p>
<p>who were laughing, kind of mocking Putin.</p>
<p>It was very serious.</p>
<p>I felt there was a divide there.</p>
<p>So since then, I mean in a certain sense,</p>
<p>the Europe reaction to Putin is crucial,</p>
<p>and they were more with him back then.</p>
<p>And a big thing for America was always to keep NATO,</p>
<p>to keep Europe in its pocket as a satellite.</p>
<p>And with this recent war, of course they&rsquo;ve succeeded</p>
<p>in beyond their dreams.</p>
<p>The Russians have fulfilled the fantasy</p>
<p>of the United States, to finally be this aggressor</p>
<p>that they have pictured for years.</p>
<p>We can talk about that later.</p>
<p>But at that time, Europe had significant support for Putin,</p>
<p>and the United States was sneering at Putin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct, you can say that.</p>
<p>And then, so there was this,</p>
<p>there was uncertainty as to the direction,</p>
<p>as to the future of Russia.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly when you interviewed Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>I wanted to know what they thought,</p>
<p>because we couldn&rsquo;t get the information war</p>
<p>that the United States was fighting against Russia.</p>
<p>It was in evidence back then.</p>
<p>It was full out.</p>
<p>The condemnation of Russia on all fronts.</p>
<p>I never saw a positive article about Putin.</p>
<p>Although when I traveled in the world,</p>
<p>and I traveled a lot doing documentaries,</p>
<p>it was very clear in the Middle East, in Africa, in Asia,</p>
<p>there was respect for him.</p>
<p>That he was a man who was getting his job done</p>
<p>in the interest of Russia.</p>
<p>He was, as I said in the documentary, a son of Russia.</p>
<p>Very much so, in the positive sense, a son of Russia.</p>
<p>Not that he&rsquo;s out there trying to destroy</p>
<p>the interests of other countries, no.</p>
<p>That he was out there to promote the interests of Russia,</p>
<p>but at the same time, keep a balance.</p>
<p>Keep the world into a harmony.</p>
<p>This has always been his picture.</p>
<p>Peace was always his idea.</p>
<p>In other words, he always referred to the United States</p>
<p>in all these interviews as our partners.</p>
<p>And I said, will you stop using that word?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>And he was a little bit slow in waking up</p>
<p>to what the United States was doing.</p>
<p>Well, that said, he&rsquo;s one of the most powerful men</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>He was at that time.</p>
<p>And let me ask you the human question.</p>
<p>As the old adage goes, power corrupts</p>
<p>and absolute power corrupts absolutely.</p>
<p>Did you see any corroding effects of power on the man?</p>
<p>Forget the political leader, on just the human being</p>
<p>that carries that power on his shoulders for so many years.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that he&rsquo;s been, unlike most modern leaders,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s been in office off and on,</p>
<p>because Medvedev was president</p>
<p>and he was not literally in charge.</p>
<p>He took another appointment at that point,</p>
<p>but he was still very much involved.</p>
<p>But for 20 years, more or less,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s been at the administrator of the state,</p>
<p>the protector of the state.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s apparently done a good enough job</p>
<p>that the Russian people have kept him there.</p>
<p>Because contrary to what many people think,</p>
<p>I really believe that if the Russian people didn&rsquo;t want him,</p>
<p>he would be out.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you can go against the will of the people.</p>
<p>Now, it expresses itself in many ways,</p>
<p>at the ballot box and so forth,</p>
<p>but also in other ways in Russia.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a strong currents of opinion.</p>
<p>So contrary to what the position of him as a dictator,</p>
<p>he wouldn&rsquo;t last if he was unpopular, number one.</p>
<p>Number two, Russia is much more divided than people know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other factors in Russia.</p>
<p>There are always tensions around the Kremlin,</p>
<p>who has power, who doesn&rsquo;t have power.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been going on for 100 years.</p>
<p>But the factions in Russia are very much there.</p>
<p>So when people refer to Russia as Putin, they&rsquo;re mistaken.</p>
<p>And they do this regularly in the New York papers</p>
<p>and all this.</p>
<p>They say, Putin did this, Putin did that,</p>
<p>Putin&rsquo;s doing that, but it&rsquo;s Russia that&rsquo;s doing it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what, there&rsquo;s a distinction there that I,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s changed.</p>
<p>In the old days, I would read about Khrushchev,</p>
<p>but it was never Khrushchev personally.</p>
<p>It was about the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>There was respect for a country.</p>
<p>And now when it started to get personal with Putin,</p>
<p>it changed and our thinking changed in a negative way.</p>
<p>We no longer respected it as a country,</p>
<p>we were seeing it as a man.</p>
<p>And the man we had trashed repeatedly,</p>
<p>repeatedly as a poisoner, as a murderer,</p>
<p>and none of which has ever been proven,</p>
<p>but which has always been repeated and repeated</p>
<p>to the point at which it becomes like an Orwell mantra.</p>
<p>It becomes like, he is of course a bad guy.</p>
<p>Can I just ask you, as a great filmmaker,</p>
<p>as a human being, what was it like talking</p>
<p>to one of the most powerful men in the world?</p>
<p>For honestly, and I&rsquo;m not naive,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to a lot of powerful people.</p>
<p>In the movie business, there are powerful people</p>
<p>and many of them are corrupted.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to many people in my life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in the military, I&rsquo;ve seen, I&rsquo;ve had other jobs.</p>
<p>I have to say, I found him to be a human being.</p>
<p>I just found him to be reasonable, calm.</p>
<p>I never saw him lose his temper.</p>
<p>And I mean, you have to understand that most people,</p>
<p>most people in the Western way of doing business</p>
<p>get emotional.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see that.</p>
<p>I saw him as a balanced man,</p>
<p>as a man who had studied this like you have.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a calmness to you.</p>
<p>It comes from studying the world</p>
<p>and having a rational response to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, his two daughters,</p>
<p>one of them is very scientific</p>
<p>and the other one&rsquo;s doing very well in another profession,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re a thinking family.</p>
<p>His wife too was.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t talk for the new wife</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know about it,</p>
<p>but he kept his family with great respect.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s raised his daughter&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>He served Yeltsin the way he looked at it.</p>
<p>He served Yeltsin well, and he never trashed Yeltsin.</p>
<p>Certainly a lot of people did,</p>
<p>but I asked him repeatedly was he an alcoholic,</p>
<p>this or that, but he wouldn&rsquo;t even go that far.</p>
<p>Just respect.</p>
<p>And this man, Yeltsin, was in many ways ridiculed</p>
<p>by the Russians, and he turned over the power</p>
<p>because he felt like he was overwhelmed.</p>
<p>He turned over the power to this man because why?</p>
<p>How many people had he fired before him?</p>
<p>Several, several prime ministers, this, that.</p>
<p>Why did he turn power over to Mr. Putin?</p>
<p>Because he respected him for his work ethic</p>
<p>and his balance, his maturity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I can say is I saw in him.</p>
<p>A poor person from a poor family who worked his way up</p>
<p>through the KGB, Americans keep saying he&rsquo;s a KGB agent,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like saying George Bush was a CIA agent,</p>
<p>but he became, you grow, you grow in your life.</p>
<p>And he went from the KGB to this technocratic position.</p>
<p>He dealt with many problems, including the Chechnyan War,</p>
<p>which is a very difficult situation,</p>
<p>as well as the Russian submarine problem.</p>
<p>Several things happened early in his,</p>
<p>that gave him a lot of experience,</p>
<p>and he handled them all pretty well.</p>
<p>Do you think he was an honest man?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>Now, of course, the question of money,</p>
<p>the charge is that he&rsquo;s the richest man in the world,</p>
<p>or ludicrous, certainly doesn&rsquo;t live like it</p>
<p>or act like it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re rich, I&rsquo;ve been around</p>
<p>a lot of rich people in my life.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d probably have, too.</p>
<p>In America, you run into them.</p>
<p>So many of them are arrogant.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually good friends now</p>
<p>with the richest man in the world.</p>
<p>Of course, I saw your interview with Mr. Musk,</p>
<p>who I appreciate.</p>
<p>At least he speaks freely.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m positive about him owning Twitter,</p>
<p>because Twitter has become censorship city,</p>
<p>as has all the major tech.</p>
<p>I mean, the censorship that we are now seeing</p>
<p>in the United States is so unAmerican and shocking to me.</p>
<p>And he is a resistance to that, that is true.</p>
<p>Yeah, I like Musk for that.</p>
<p>Just for that only.</p>
<p>But I also appreciate him, his adventuresome,</p>
<p>his nature and his desire to explore the world</p>
<p>and to ask questions.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s certain ways you sound when you speak freely.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain ways you sound,</p>
<p>a man sounds when he speaks freely,</p>
<p>and he speaks freely.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s refreshing.</p>
<p>No matter whether you&rsquo;re rich or not, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>When you speak freely, it&rsquo;s a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>Actually, Musk, in a major point</p>
<p>on going back to nuclear energy,</p>
<p>he never believed in it at first, apparently.</p>
<p>He was going for batteries, right?</p>
<p>And he put a lot of money into batteries.</p>
<p>He made them bigger and bigger batteries.</p>
<p>But it just, as Bill Gates has said,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s not gonna get us there.</p>
<p>And now I think Musk is on another path.</p>
<p>He understands the need for nuclear.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s a supporter of nuclear.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re jumping around.</p>
<p>Putin never asked for one thing, never.</p>
<p>It was an interview, it was free form.</p>
<p>Ask anything you want.</p>
<p>No restrictions, no rules.</p>
<p>As with Castro, frankly,</p>
<p>Castro did the same thing as did Chavez.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve had good luck in interviewing free ranging subjects,</p>
<p>people willing to express themselves.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s much more guarded than Castro or Chavez,</p>
<p>because as you know, he&rsquo;s setting government policy</p>
<p>when he speaks.</p>
<p>Anything he says is gonna be taken out of context.</p>
<p>But there was no restrictions on what to talk about,</p>
<p>none of that.</p>
<p>Nor any desire to see anything before we published it.</p>
<p>No need to check it with him.</p>
<p>It was a completely.</p>
<p>Do you think he watched the final product?</p>
<p>Yes, I do, but I don&rsquo;t think he made judgments on it.</p>
<p>I think he was pleased.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t go either way.</p>
<p>You see, he&rsquo;s pleased.</p>
<p>I mean, it went well and he&rsquo;s happy for us.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think he had great enthusiasm</p>
<p>expressed it to me.</p>
<p>He trusted me.</p>
<p>And you can see the way he dealt with me each time.</p>
<p>He warmed up to me four times.</p>
<p>The first time I might&rsquo;ve been a little stiff.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re asking, you don&rsquo;t know who you&rsquo;re dealing with</p>
<p>and so forth.</p>
<p>I understand that.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s used to it now.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s done a lot of press.</p>
<p>The worst press he&rsquo;s done, frankly,</p>
<p>has been the American press.</p>
<p>And not because of his fault,</p>
<p>but because of the way they have treated him.</p>
<p>If you look at the interviews, they&rsquo;re awful.</p>
<p>First of all, I noticed one thing as a filmmaker,</p>
<p>right away, they use an overdub.</p>
<p>They put a Russian speaker for everything he says,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s much harsher.</p>
<p>He speaks Russian in a much harsher manner</p>
<p>than actually Putin does.</p>
<p>On my interview, I left him in his original language</p>
<p>with translator, and I think that&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>because he expresses himself very clearly and calmly.</p>
<p>When you listen to the American broadcast,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a belligerent person who looks like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s about to bang his shoe on the table.</p>
<p>And secondly, the questions are highly aggressive</p>
<p>from the beginning.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no sense of rapport, there&rsquo;s no sense of,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s why, Mr. Putin, did you poison this person?</p>
<p>Why, Mr. Putin, did you kill this person?</p>
<p>Why are you a murderer?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s blunt, blunt negative television.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not just aggressive.</p>
<p>So I obviously speak Russian,</p>
<p>so I get to appreciate both the original and the translation.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just aggressive, it&rsquo;s very shallow.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not looking to understand.</p>
<p>To me, aggression is okay if that&rsquo;s the way</p>
<p>you wanna approach it, but it should be,</p>
<p>there should be underlying kind of empathy</p>
<p>for another human being in order to be able to understand.</p>
<p>And so some of the worst interviews I&rsquo;ve ever listened to</p>
<p>is by American press of Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>So NBC and all those kinds of organizations,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very painful to watch.</p>
<p>And you saw the reception to the Putin interviews</p>
<p>in America was hostile without seeing it.</p>
<p>So many people criticized my series</p>
<p>without having seen it.</p>
<p>Even, I went on a show, a television show</p>
<p>with this famous coal bearer.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s very famous in America.</p>
<p>And I was shocked on the show to find out</p>
<p>that he hadn&rsquo;t seen anything of the four hours.</p>
<p>He was just attacking Putin.</p>
<p>And he threw me, I was complicit,</p>
<p>therefore I was a Putin supporter.</p>
<p>And the show was a disaster.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of my worst television shows.</p>
<p>I actually, I had to just shut up and get off the air.</p>
<p>I mean, at some point, it was embarrassing.</p>
<p>Because the audience, too, was clapping for Kobe</p>
<p>on anything he said.</p>
<p>Well, as an interviewer in that situation,</p>
<p>because between you and Vladimir Putin,</p>
<p>there was camaraderie, there was joking, there was&hellip;</p>
<p>Are you worried, do you put that into the calculation</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re making a film with somebody</p>
<p>that could be lying to you, that could be evil?</p>
<p>When you talk about Castro, you talk about,</p>
<p>so are you worried about how charisma of a man</p>
<p>across the table from you can&hellip;</p>
<p>Do I take that into account?</p>
<p>I absolutely take that into account.</p>
<p>I mean, doing Castro, he&rsquo;s a wonderful speaker,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s charismatic, so is Chavez.</p>
<p>Look at those interviews.</p>
<p>I took it into account.</p>
<p>But Putin doesn&rsquo;t play that game.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t charm you, he doesn&rsquo;t try to overwhelm you</p>
<p>with his bon ami at all.</p>
<p>He just says, okay, ask your question,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you my answer straight.</p>
<p>Here it is, and he analyzes it.</p>
<p>This is the history of NATO,</p>
<p>this is the history of our relationship</p>
<p>with the United States.</p>
<p>How many times have we tried to talk to them</p>
<p>about such and such and such and such,</p>
<p>and each time, we get nowhere.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s a very&hellip;</p>
<p>I would like to get along with the United States so much,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s saying it so clearly in all his words.</p>
<p>So to play devil&rsquo;s advocate.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s not making a big deal about it.</p>
<p>But there is a charisma in the calmness.</p>
<p>Yes, there is.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just calm everything down, it&rsquo;s simple facts.</p>
<p>That you can call, so there&rsquo;s like the Hitler thing,</p>
<p>which is screaming, being very loud, charismatic,</p>
<p>strong message and so on.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a Putin style,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not comparing those two,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the Putin style communication of calmness.</p>
<p>And that, at least to me, my personality,</p>
<p>that can be very captivating,</p>
<p>is bringing everything down, the facts are simple.</p>
<p>But then when you say the facts are simple,</p>
<p>you can now start lying.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s true and what&rsquo;s lies.</p>
<p>It behooves you to do some research.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And frankly, when it comes to research,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have a problem.</p>
<p>Because if you go to the Americanized versions</p>
<p>of Russian history, you&rsquo;re gonna run into a problem.</p>
<p>And that includes even Wikipedia.</p>
<p>They will tell you things</p>
<p>that are just not factually supported.</p>
<p>So it was a problem in terms of,</p>
<p>if you read all the books in the American library</p>
<p>about Putin, there&rsquo;s nothing positive about it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re awful, they&rsquo;re awful.</p>
<p>And a lot of them, I had a good relationship</p>
<p>with Professor Stephen Cohen,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the most, I think, one of the most informed men</p>
<p>on Russia, he&rsquo;d done a lot of research all his life.</p>
<p>And knew Gorbachev very well.</p>
<p>And was very analytical about all these situations</p>
<p>that happened before his death in 2019.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not quite sure when Stephen died,</p>
<p>but I knew him well.</p>
<p>And he gave me the best information I could get.</p>
<p>I would go to Stephen and I&rsquo;d say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m confused here, tell me the history</p>
<p>of this accusation of poisoning against this person</p>
<p>and so forth.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;d explain it to me in, I think,</p>
<p>the clearest ways that I understood.</p>
<p>And he said to me once, he said,</p>
<p>most of these people who go to Russia</p>
<p>and write this stuff about Putin are going off internet.</p>
<p>The internet has really been a source</p>
<p>of a lot of fractured facts here.</p>
<p>He said, pure analysis.</p>
<p>You have to go back to the texts,</p>
<p>all the documents, and to really fully understand.</p>
<p>But he spoke Russian.</p>
<p>And his wife and him, Katerina Vanhoovle,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s an editor, publisher of The Nation magazine,</p>
<p>would go to Russia several times a year</p>
<p>and talk to their friend Gorbachev.</p>
<p>And Gorbachev&rsquo;s an interesting character.</p>
<p>I talked to him, interviewed him,</p>
<p>not interviewed him, but talked to him at length,</p>
<p>and I like him very much.</p>
<p>And I saw the divide, as you saw in the Putin interviews,</p>
<p>between Gorbachev and Putin.</p>
<p>Early on in the interviews, you sense Putin</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t particularly care for Gorbachev</p>
<p>because in his point of view,</p>
<p>he screwed up the administration of Russia</p>
<p>and is responsible for so much of the disaster</p>
<p>of leaving all those people outside the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>So these are problems that continue into the future.</p>
<p>But they see each other at the,</p>
<p>or he knows he&rsquo;s there at the May Day Parade, we filmed,</p>
<p>and his attitude is funny, it&rsquo;s very human.</p>
<p>He says, you know, he&rsquo;s welcome, he&rsquo;s got his pension,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a pensioneer, he&rsquo;s done his duty.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no animus towards him.</p>
<p>Even when Gorbachev, in the early days,</p>
<p>as you remember, criticized for his manners in terms</p>
<p>of democracy, but I don&rsquo;t know that that becomes a quarrel.</p>
<p>But frankly, by the end of the situation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very clear that Gorbachev has now moved closer</p>
<p>and closer to the, says that Russia is now</p>
<p>really under attack.</p>
<p>This is, he sees where the United States</p>
<p>has made a concerted effort to undermine Putin.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s repeated this several times about Ukraine.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve seen what he said.</p>
<p>You can quote it.</p>
<p>And Gorbachev is, we have no respect for Gorbachev even,</p>
<p>even at this juncture.</p>
<p>When can you see Gorbachev&rsquo;s ideas printed</p>
<p>in most American newspapers?</p>
<p>Very rarely, very rarely, and recently not at all.</p>
<p>So Gorbachev, who was our hero back in,</p>
<p>an American hero back in the 1980s,</p>
<p>has now been condemned to the garbage can,</p>
<p>so to speak, of history.</p>
<p>Well, in this complicated geopolitical picture</p>
<p>you just outlined, can we talk about</p>
<p>the recent invasion of Ukraine?</p>
<p>So you wrote on Facebook a pretty eloquent analysis,</p>
<p>I think on March 3rd.</p>
<p>Let me just read a small section of that,</p>
<p>just to give context, and maybe we can talk</p>
<p>a little bit more about both Russia and the man Putin.</p>
<p>You wrote, although the United States</p>
<p>has many wars of aggression on its conscience,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t justify Mr. Putin&rsquo;s aggression in Ukraine.</p>
<p>A dozen wrongs don&rsquo;t make a right.</p>
<p>Russia was wrong to invade.</p>
<p>It has made too many mistakes.</p>
<p>One, underestimating Ukraine resistance.</p>
<p>Two, overestimating the military ability</p>
<p>to achieve its objective.</p>
<p>Three, underestimating Europe&rsquo;s reaction,</p>
<p>especially Germany, upping its military contribution</p>
<p>to NATO, which they&rsquo;ve resisted for some 20 years.</p>
<p>Even Switzerland has joined the cause.</p>
<p>Russia will be more isolated than ever from the West.</p>
<p>Four, underestimating the enhanced power of NATO,</p>
<p>which will now put more pressure on Russia&rsquo;s borders.</p>
<p>Five, probably putting Ukraine into NATO.</p>
<p>Six, underestimating the damage to its own economy,</p>
<p>and certainly creating more internal resistance</p>
<p>in Russia.</p>
<p>Seven, creating a major readjustment of power</p>
<p>in its oligarch class.</p>
<p>Eight, putting cluster and vacuum bombs into play.</p>
<p>Nine, and underestimating the power</p>
<p>of social media worldwide.</p>
<p>And you go on for a while giving a much broader picture</p>
<p>of the history and the geopolitics of all of this.</p>
<p>So now, a little bit later, two months later,</p>
<p>what are your thoughts about the invasion of Ukraine?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s very hard to be honest in this regard</p>
<p>because the West has brought down a curtain here</p>
<p>and anyone who questions the invasion of Ukraine</p>
<p>and its consequences is an enemy of the people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s become so difficult.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen in my lifetime ever such a wall</p>
<p>of propaganda as I&rsquo;ve seen in the West.</p>
<p>And that includes France too</p>
<p>because I was there recently and England.</p>
<p>England is of course really vociferous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s shocking to me how quickly Europe moved</p>
<p>in this direction and that includes Germany.</p>
<p>I have German friends who express to me their shock</p>
<p>over Ukraine.</p>
<p>I have Italian friends, same thing.</p>
<p>And Italy of course has been perhaps the most understanding</p>
<p>and compassionate of countries.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s quite evident that there&rsquo;s a united,</p>
<p>and this attests to the power of the United States.</p>
<p>And of course you have Finland and Svinland</p>
<p>which has generally been reasonable jumping in,</p>
<p>talking about joining NATO and Sweden too.</p>
<p>Generally there&rsquo;s been some more restraint in Europe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what surprised me the most, Europe.</p>
<p>How quickly they fell into this NATO basket</p>
<p>which is very dangerous for Europe, very dangerous.</p>
<p>This goes back to my idea what I was saying earlier</p>
<p>about sovereignty.</p>
<p>These countries don&rsquo;t really give me a sense</p>
<p>that they have sovereignty over their own countries.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t feel, to me I&rsquo;m obviously intuition here</p>
<p>is working, I just don&rsquo;t feel that they have freedom</p>
<p>to say what they really think and they&rsquo;re scared to say it.</p>
<p>When the United States invaded Iraq in 2003,</p>
<p>I remember with great in a sense satisfaction</p>
<p>that at least France, Chirac who I had not really</p>
<p>known much about, stood up and said the United States</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna join you in this expedition,</p>
<p>basically into madness.</p>
<p>Schroeder in Germany, same thing.</p>
<p>Of course Putin condemned the invasion</p>
<p>and Putin had been an ally of the United States</p>
<p>since 9 11 if you remember correctly.</p>
<p>And had called Bush and they were getting along.</p>
<p>So even Putin said I won&rsquo;t go, don&rsquo;t go into Iraq.</p>
<p>This is not the solution.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t oppose Afghanistan but he opposed Iraq.</p>
<p>So Chirac and Schroeder stood for the old Europe.</p>
<p>I remember de Gaulle, Charles de Gaulle,</p>
<p>he was independent of the United States.</p>
<p>Charles de Gaulle pulled France out of NATO</p>
<p>because he saw the dangers of NATO,</p>
<p>which is to say you have to fight an American war.</p>
<p>When they say and they put nuclear weapons</p>
<p>on your territory in England and France</p>
<p>and Italy and Germany, when they do that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re hitched to this superpower</p>
<p>and you have no say in what they&rsquo;re gonna do.</p>
<p>If they declare war and they use your territory,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be involved in a major conflict.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about sovereignty.</p>
<p>Where is that sovereignty?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have it.</p>
<p>And that has influenced their mindset for years now.</p>
<p>Since 1940, well de Gaulle was the 60s.</p>
<p>He actually reversed the whole flow</p>
<p>and I think it was Sarkozy who put France</p>
<p>back into NATO and now it&rsquo;s Macron.</p>
<p>I hope because he was talking to Putin</p>
<p>would at least have an independent viewpoint</p>
<p>that could be helpful here, so he rolled it up.</p>
<p>He may have told Putin something else,</p>
<p>but within days he had rolled it up</p>
<p>and gone along with the United States position,</p>
<p>which was enforced by the United States in a very fierce way.</p>
<p>The propaganda, as I say, I don&rsquo;t know how much time</p>
<p>you spend in America, but it was vicious</p>
<p>and everything was anti Russian.</p>
<p>Russia were killing all these people,</p>
<p>were shooting down civilians,</p>
<p>although there was no proof of it.</p>
<p>There was just, these are the accidents of war,</p>
<p>but all of a sudden it was a campaign of criminality</p>
<p>and they were talking about bringing Putin</p>
<p>into war crime trial.</p>
<p>Well, why didn&rsquo;t they talk like that when Iraq was going on</p>
<p>and Bush was killing far more people?</p>
<p>Or for that matter, why were they not talking</p>
<p>about the killings in Donbass and Lugansk</p>
<p>during that 2014 to 2022 period?</p>
<p>That is what, it&rsquo;s a crime.</p>
<p>There were so many people that were killed,</p>
<p>many of them innocent, many of them innocent.</p>
<p>What would be the way for Vladimir Putin</p>
<p>to stop the killing in Donbass</p>
<p>without the invasion of Ukraine?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very good question and I&rsquo;ve asked that</p>
<p>several times and I don&rsquo;t have the,</p>
<p>I have not talked to him since about two years now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very good question.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the mistakes, what the human mistakes</p>
<p>and the leadership mistakes made by Vladimir Putin?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very good question.</p>
<p>You see, what the American press has not said</p>
<p>and the Western press has not said is that on February 24,</p>
<p>was it, that was, on that day when they invaded,</p>
<p>the day before, if you check the logs</p>
<p>of the European organization that was supervising,</p>
<p>was in the field in Ukraine.</p>
<p>These are neutral observers.</p>
<p>They were seeing heavier and heavier artillery fire</p>
<p>going into Donbass from the Ukrainian side.</p>
<p>So they had, apparently, Ukraine had 110,000 troops</p>
<p>on the border.</p>
<p>They were about to invade Donbass, that was the plan.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I think.</p>
<p>Russia, because of the buildup on the border of Donbass,</p>
<p>brought 130, they say 130,000 troops</p>
<p>to the area near Donbass, right?</p>
<p>So you have buildup of forces on both sides,</p>
<p>but you wouldn&rsquo;t know that from reading the press</p>
<p>in the West.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d believe that the Russians suddenly put all these men</p>
<p>into the situation with the idea of invading Ukraine,</p>
<p>not only Donbass, but invading all of Ukraine</p>
<p>and getting rid of the, decapitating the government there,</p>
<p>which is all assumption.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what they would intend it to do.</p>
<p>But you, at the time, as in a lot of people,</p>
<p>thought that all the talk of the invasion,</p>
<p>Russian invasion of Ukraine, is just propaganda.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very unlikely to happen.</p>
<p>I think many of us thought that the United States</p>
<p>is building this up into an invasion.</p>
<p>In other words, that is the nature of false flag operations,</p>
<p>when you create this propaganda.</p>
<p>They are gonna invade.</p>
<p>And then, when they invaded, the United States</p>
<p>was completely ready, and all their allies</p>
<p>were completely ready for the invasion, correct?</p>
<p>So why did Putin do that?</p>
<p>He fell into this, theoretically, into this trap</p>
<p>set by the United States.</p>
<p>Here you&rsquo;re telling all your allies across the board</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna invade.</p>
<p>But you.</p>
<p>Why do you think he did it?</p>
<p>So here, is it madness, or is it common</p>
<p>strategic calculation, perhaps?</p>
<p>This one I cannot answer you faithfully,</p>
<p>because, first of all, we don&rsquo;t know what he was told.</p>
<p>If he was indeed getting the right intelligence estimates,</p>
<p>from what I said earlier in that essay I wrote,</p>
<p>you would think he was not well informed, perhaps,</p>
<p>about the degree of cooperation he would get</p>
<p>from the Ukrainian Russians in Ukraine.</p>
<p>That would be one factor, that he wasn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t assess the operation correctly.</p>
<p>Remember this.</p>
<p>Mr. Putin has had this cancer, and I think he&rsquo;s licked it,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s also been isolated because of COVID.</p>
<p>And some people would argue that the isolation</p>
<p>from normal activity, which he was meeting people</p>
<p>face to face, but all of a sudden he was meeting people</p>
<p>across the table 100 yards away, or whatever,</p>
<p>10 yards away, it was very hard.</p>
<p>Perhaps he lost touch with, contact with people.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just power, it&rsquo;s the very simple fact</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re just distant from humans.</p>
<p>As I say, I&rsquo;m speculating, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I see that, and I also, perhaps he thought in his mind</p>
<p>that there would be a faster resolution</p>
<p>that the Ukrainian, because the evidence had been</p>
<p>that the Ukrainian Russians, the Ukrainian army</p>
<p>had folded so many times, and that they were only backed up</p>
<p>and they were stiffened by the resistance</p>
<p>of the Nazi oriented Azov battalions.</p>
<p>That was a factor, of course.</p>
<p>And that is a big factor for the Russians</p>
<p>because these people are very tough, they rush.</p>
<p>See, what people don&rsquo;t understand is that Ukraine,</p>
<p>since 2014, has been a terror state.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been run, anytime a Ukrainian has expressed</p>
<p>any understanding of the Russian Ukrainian position,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been threatened by the state.</p>
<p>From 2014 to 2022, there&rsquo;s been a set of hideous murders</p>
<p>that people don&rsquo;t even know about in the West.</p>
<p>Journalists, people who speak out, liberals,</p>
<p>people who, I interviewed Viktor Medvedev,</p>
<p>who they make out to be some kind of horrible person,</p>
<p>but Medvedev was a very important figure</p>
<p>in the administration of Khushma,</p>
<p>the first Ukrainian Prime Minister in the 1990s,</p>
<p>and he did a great job on the economy.</p>
<p>He was a very thoughtful man.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ll see my interview, it&rsquo;s called Ukraine Revealed.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very thoughtful about the future of Ukraine.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t want to go back and join Russia.</p>
<p>He wants it to be an independent country.</p>
<p>Ukraine is independent, and he wants it to be</p>
<p>a functioning economic democracy, more or less,</p>
<p>a democracy, if you can get that,</p>
<p>that exists in a neutral state,</p>
<p>a neutral state, which Ukraine used to be before 2014.</p>
<p>It was neutral from 1991 to 2014, neutral, very important.</p>
<p>Under Poroshenko, it just immediately went</p>
<p>into an anti Soviet Cold War position</p>
<p>as an ally of the United States,</p>
<p>and my point was that it was a very dangerous place</p>
<p>in Ukraine.</p>
<p>People were being killed, death squads were out there.</p>
<p>Medvedev, they stripped him of his television stations</p>
<p>very suddenly, this is Zelensky, the new president.</p>
<p>Zelensky was elected on a peace platform, remember that.</p>
<p>70% of the country was for him to make peace with Russia.</p>
<p>Did he ever even try to make peace with Russia?</p>
<p>Did he attend any of the Minsk Two agreements?</p>
<p>Did he visit, did he pay any attention to the Minsk?</p>
<p>Did he pay attention to Putin?</p>
<p>Did he go to Russia?</p>
<p>No, not at all.</p>
<p>The moment he got into office, I&rsquo;m convinced</p>
<p>that the militant sector of the right sector parties</p>
<p>of Ukraine let him know that you will not make a deal</p>
<p>with Russia, there&rsquo;ll be no concessions to Russia.</p>
<p>This is very dangerous.</p>
<p>This is where this attitude that&rsquo;s very, very hostile</p>
<p>to Russia has hurt us.</p>
<p>The whole world is being hurt by this,</p>
<p>and no one calls them out.</p>
<p>No one calls them out.</p>
<p>Zelensky backed off from his platform</p>
<p>as running for president, and as president,</p>
<p>has been ineffective, did nothing to promote it.</p>
<p>On the contrary, went the other way,</p>
<p>and seemed to support the Ukrainian aggression.</p>
<p>Well, he found his support in this war.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve revealed through your work some of the most honest</p>
<p>and dark aspects of war.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this is a war,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a humanitarian crisis.</p>
<p>Millions of people, refugees, escape in Ukraine.</p>
<p>What do you think about the human cost of this war,</p>
<p>initiated by whoever, just as you write,</p>
<p>whatever the context, whatever NATO, whatever pressure,</p>
<p>as you wrote, Russia was wrong to invade.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, let&rsquo;s get back to that original question.</p>
<p>You said, what was he thinking at that time?</p>
<p>We never answered that.</p>
<p>Now, by the way, among those people</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve been ruined by this war,</p>
<p>you have to include the 2014 to 2022 Ukrainian Russians.</p>
<p>14,000 were killed, not necessarily by,</p>
<p>some of them by maybe accident and this and that,</p>
<p>but certainly a large number of that</p>
<p>is responsible to the Ukrainian military</p>
<p>and the Nazi related battalions</p>
<p>who have done a good job of death squatting that whole area.</p>
<p>And remember, I did a film about Salvador.</p>
<p>I know a little bit about death squads and how they work,</p>
<p>and I know about paramilitaries,</p>
<p>because in South America, they&rsquo;re all over the place.</p>
<p>America supports, hates Venezuela,</p>
<p>goes on about Venezuela,</p>
<p>but do they tell you anything about Colombia,</p>
<p>its next door neighbor?</p>
<p>Colombia for years has been plagued by paramilitaries</p>
<p>that are right wing, and the United States has said,</p>
<p>nothing about them except occasionally,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a newspaper report now.</p>
<p>So this support of death squads by the United States</p>
<p>is all over the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just in South America and Central America</p>
<p>where we see plenty of evidence of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s here too, and this is what&rsquo;s horrible</p>
<p>about this whole thing, this hypocrisy of America</p>
<p>that they can support such evil, such evil.</p>
<p>Now, going back to your larger question about,</p>
<p>yeah, it&rsquo;s a terrible refugee disaster,</p>
<p>but again, we have to get the numbers.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get the numbers and get the evidence,</p>
<p>because I would ask you, I&rsquo;m not sure at this point</p>
<p>whether more civilians were killed before 2022 in Donbass</p>
<p>than have been killed in this latest.</p>
<p>So we can&rsquo;t talk about this without,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t talk about the invasion of Ukraine</p>
<p>without considering the full war</p>
<p>between Russia and Ukraine since 2014.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct, absolutely,</p>
<p>and take the toll on both sides,</p>
<p>and you might be surprised by the result.</p>
<p>I think the Russian military, of course, I&rsquo;m not there,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not, this is speculation.</p>
<p>The Russian military has slowed down,</p>
<p>and part of that reason</p>
<p>is not to keep the civilian corridors open,</p>
<p>and I think the Ukrainian military</p>
<p>has made it more difficult on purpose,</p>
<p>especially some of these battalions</p>
<p>that are death squad battalions have gone out of their way</p>
<p>to keep the civilians locked into these cities in danger</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s in their interest to do so.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no reason why Ukrainian military,</p>
<p>who have killed Ukrainian civilians for years,</p>
<p>would change their policies.</p>
<p>They would have no compunctions about wiping out,</p>
<p>for example, people with white armbands in Bukha.</p>
<p>Okay, as to what Putin was thinking at the time,</p>
<p>I wondered this, and I still do.</p>
<p>I said, okay, so Putin can say,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say the Ukrainian government</p>
<p>wants to now invade Donbass.</p>
<p>This is on February 23, and they have artillery,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re peppering the whole place.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna go in, and they&rsquo;re gonna get Donbass back.</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<p>And you have Russian separatists,</p>
<p>who are Russian Ukrainians who are on,</p>
<p>who are gonna fight.</p>
<p>How far do you go in supporting them?</p>
<p>Can Russia at this point say, well, we can&rsquo;t help you.</p>
<p>You have to get along, you have to somehow,</p>
<p>you have to be absorbed by the Kiev,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be absorbed by them,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not gonna give you autonomy,</p>
<p>and you have to live with them,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s gonna be a price to pay.</p>
<p>You could do that, and you could also say,</p>
<p>well, we open our borders to Donbass.</p>
<p>You can come in to our country, you can leave,</p>
<p>and we will help you to resettle.</p>
<p>And that would be a reasonable approach.</p>
<p>So you take it to the next stage, as Putin&rsquo;s thinking.</p>
<p>You take it to the next stage.</p>
<p>You stall, it&rsquo;s harder for your,</p>
<p>of course, there&rsquo;s this pressure on Putin</p>
<p>from inside his own government to say,</p>
<p>what are you gonna do?</p>
<p>I mean, you can&rsquo;t do this,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of nationalists in Russia.</p>
<p>They would certainly bring, it would be to his,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d say Putin is weak, and that&rsquo;s the biggest rap</p>
<p>you can ever give a Russian leader,</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re weak, you can&rsquo;t get anything done.</p>
<p>So there would have been some damage,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say he goes with that, and he says,</p>
<p>okay, we know what the United States intention is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to get rid of me, regime change,</p>
<p>and to get another Yeltsin in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they want.</p>
<p>And they will go to any ends,</p>
<p>they will destroy Ukraine if necessary,</p>
<p>but they want regime change in Russia.</p>
<p>And then after they do that, of course,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll go after China,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the ultimate policy of the United States.</p>
<p>This is a country that has no compunctions</p>
<p>about going all the way,</p>
<p>and it will use hypocrisy and all the news propaganda</p>
<p>in the world to get what it wants.</p>
<p>This is the equivalent, frankly,</p>
<p>of Germany&rsquo;s goals in World War II, world domination.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question in my mind,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re going about it in our way</p>
<p>as opposed to Hitler&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>So just to finish your thought, where do they go?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s stage two?</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s say they take, Ukraine takes back Donbas.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say people get killed in large quantities.</p>
<p>So we now to the next stage,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re finished with the Minsk II agreements</p>
<p>that were never adhered to.</p>
<p>So what does Russia do?</p>
<p>They wait for the next aggression,</p>
<p>which is gonna come in one form or another.</p>
<p>Perhaps in Georgia, I don&rsquo;t know what happened,</p>
<p>what the US is thinking,</p>
<p>but the US cannot say Russia has done anything.</p>
<p>They have not used violence to stop Donbas</p>
<p>from belonging back to Ukraine, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re in a new setup now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a whole thing rearranges.</p>
<p>Now you have, but you still have nuclear weapons,</p>
<p>and you still have a Russian nuclear weapons,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re serious weapons.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very well developed, crude,</p>
<p>but not as refined as the American nuclear force,</p>
<p>but powerful.</p>
<p>That becomes another game.</p>
<p>Then you open another chess board,</p>
<p>and you still haven&rsquo;t been condemned.</p>
<p>The sanctions haven&rsquo;t been imposed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a new, it&rsquo;s a new game.</p>
<p>Could he have done, could he have lived with that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the question I ask myself.</p>
<p>So you see ultimately Ukraine today</p>
<p>as a battleground for the proxy war</p>
<p>between Russia and the United States.</p>
<p>The United States would have then NATOized Ukraine,</p>
<p>or certainly put more weapons in.</p>
<p>The United States has already done a lot in Ukraine</p>
<p>with intelligence, with training advisors.</p>
<p>The intelligence aspect of the Ukrainian army</p>
<p>has been raised enormously by the United States contribution.</p>
<p>Is it possible for you to steal man,</p>
<p>to play devil&rsquo;s advocate against yourself,</p>
<p>and say that Vladimir Zelensky</p>
<p>is fighting for the sovereignty of his nation?</p>
<p>And in a way against Russia,</p>
<p>but also against the United States,</p>
<p>it just happens that for now, the United States</p>
<p>is a useful ally.</p>
<p>But ultimately, the man, the leader,</p>
<p>is fighting for the sovereignty of his nation.</p>
<p>I would think, he thinks so.</p>
<p>Yes, and he could say that.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s not acknowledging that the sovereignty</p>
<p>of his nation was stolen in 2014</p>
<p>with the coup d&rsquo;tat that brought this right sector</p>
<p>into power, and they have controlled the country since then.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s thuggery, what they&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>The Medvedev case is a case in point.</p>
<p>They just take what they need.</p>
<p>They go to a house, and they have a,</p>
<p>how many people have been killed?</p>
<p>Serious people, journalists killed by these battalions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what people don&rsquo;t realize.</p>
<p>In other words, you can&rsquo;t speak out.</p>
<p>A person like me would have been on the death list</p>
<p>on day five.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no opposition to Zelensky,</p>
<p>so he doesn&rsquo;t have a real sovereignty.</p>
<p>It was a stolen sovereignty.</p>
<p>Do you think President Zelensky would accept</p>
<p>an interview with you today?</p>
<p>Actually, since I made Ukraine on Fire,</p>
<p>a documentary which perhaps you&rsquo;ve seen,</p>
<p>which records the incidents of 2014</p>
<p>and the Maidan demonstrations,</p>
<p>and shows you the dishonesty behind it,</p>
<p>no, I think that they&rsquo;ve been very negative,</p>
<p>and they would kill me if I was in Ukraine.</p>
<p>I mean, they don&rsquo;t have any,</p>
<p>these people are very tough.</p>
<p>These are as rough as they come, in my opinion,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve seen rough in my life.</p>
<p>I mean, these guys are not playing fair at all.</p>
<p>These are death squads.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think, and Zelensky would have</p>
<p>nothing to do with it, but of course,</p>
<p>it would be dangerous for me,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve been very hostile in their policies</p>
<p>to any Ukrainians abroad who are also threatened.</p>
<p>In other words, you could be in Paris,</p>
<p>but if you speak out too much,</p>
<p>I think Ukrainians know that they&rsquo;re gonna be targeted,</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s part of the reason they don&rsquo;t talk.</p>
<p>A lot of them, you have to take the anti Russian line,</p>
<p>but I think a lot of them are divided.</p>
<p>So you think you would be killed,</p>
<p>and Zelensky wouldn&rsquo;t even know about it, so there is?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think, if I was killed certainly abroad,</p>
<p>no, they wouldn&rsquo;t kill me abroad.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;d figure out a way.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, if you traveled to Ukraine, I mean.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t get in, I wouldn&rsquo;t get in,</p>
<p>except through Donbass, I&rsquo;d come through.</p>
<p>There are some Americans in Donbass</p>
<p>who are reporting on the war there,</p>
<p>and I read their reports, actually.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re pretty interesting,</p>
<p>because they show you the cruelty of what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>but never mentioned in the West, never.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so strange about this.</p>
<p>This is a modern world that we&rsquo;re living in,</p>
<p>and yet this information is not coming out</p>
<p>to the mass of the people,</p>
<p>and on the contrary, the United States has closed down</p>
<p>all the information centers that are possible</p>
<p>to alternative news getting to the American people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve seriously made an effort,</p>
<p>and the BBC, English, and France.</p>
<p>I was shocked when France closed RT down,</p>
<p>because RT is actually pretty good.</p>
<p>Yes, they may, it&rsquo;s called, there are distortions,</p>
<p>but you know as well as I do, because you hear,</p>
<p>you speak that RT has done a very brave job</p>
<p>of putting correspondents into the field</p>
<p>in very dangerous positions,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve gotten great footage</p>
<p>of some of the violence that&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Well, given the wall of propaganda in the West,</p>
<p>I also see the wall of propaganda in Russia,</p>
<p>the wall of propaganda in China,</p>
<p>the wall of propaganda in India.</p>
<p>What do we do with these walls of propaganda?</p>
<p>Yes, let&rsquo;s talk about Russia,</p>
<p>because you would know more about it,</p>
<p>but my last experience there, newspapers,</p>
<p>it was more interesting, put it this way,</p>
<p>when I went to Venezuela, the United States was saying</p>
<p>back then that Chavez controlled the press.</p>
<p>I get to Venezuela, and there&rsquo;s nothing but criticism</p>
<p>of Chavez in the press.</p>
<p>It was owned by the oligarchs of Venezuela,</p>
<p>and who hated him, so it was across the board.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why Chavez opened the state television,</p>
<p>spent more money on it, and advertised his point of view</p>
<p>through state television.</p>
<p>But in Russia, there is, what I saw was criticism.</p>
<p>I met with a publisher who got the Nobel Prize</p>
<p>of that famous newspaper, and his point of view</p>
<p>at that time when I spoke to him a few years ago</p>
<p>was we&rsquo;re operating, there is criticism of him,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t call for the overthrow of the government,</p>
<p>nor in Venezuela, nor in the United States for that matter.</p>
<p>If you call for the overthrow of the government</p>
<p>of the United States, you&rsquo;re gonna be in deep trouble.</p>
<p>Well, all right, so to push back on that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting, it&rsquo;s so interesting,</p>
<p>because we mentioned Elon Musk,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a way that people sound when they speak freely.</p>
<p>When I speak to, I have family in Ukraine,</p>
<p>I have family in Russia.</p>
<p>When I speak to people in Russia,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s put my family aside,</p>
<p>when I speak to people in Russia,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s fear.</p>
<p>I think they don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>sometimes when you call for the overthrow of government,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s important, not because you necessarily believe</p>
<p>for the overthrow of the government,</p>
<p>but you just need to test the power centers</p>
<p>and make sure they&rsquo;re responsive to the people.</p>
<p>And I feel like there&rsquo;s a mix of fear and apathy</p>
<p>that has a different texture than it does</p>
<p>in the United States.</p>
<p>That worries me, because I would like to see</p>
<p>the flourishing of a people in all places.</p>
<p>Well, as I said, my impression was that there&rsquo;s far more</p>
<p>freedom in the press than was pictured by the West,</p>
<p>and that means different points of view,</p>
<p>because the Russians are always arguing with themselves.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen a country that&rsquo;s so contentious.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more intellectuals in Moscow and the cities</p>
<p>than you can believe, and you know the Russian people there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been fighting government for years,</p>
<p>back from the 1870s, it was czarist times,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re always plotting against the government,</p>
<p>and the intelligentsia has known through history</p>
<p>as being contentious and anti government in many ways.</p>
<p>And we see the same thing,</p>
<p>educated people turning against Russia.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t appreciate those people,</p>
<p>because I think they&rsquo;re very spoiled,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t understand some of the stuff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going on in the West.</p>
<p>But we have a lot of Russians in Europe and America</p>
<p>that attack Russia and sometimes don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>that they are under pressure from the United States,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t understand the size of the pressure.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why Putin connects with the people,</p>
<p>because he represents the common,</p>
<p>more the common man who&rsquo;s saying to you,</p>
<p>your interests are threatened, Russia is threatened.</p>
<p>We are representing only the interests of Russia,</p>
<p>not, we&rsquo;re not an empire, we&rsquo;re not gonna expand.</p>
<p>He has no empire intentions,</p>
<p>although the West paints it as empire.</p>
<p>I see no evidence of it.</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t he do something in all these years?</p>
<p>Nothing, he did nothing except defend the country</p>
<p>in Georgia and in Chechnya.</p>
<p>So the imperialist imperative is coming more</p>
<p>from the West.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the imperialist, it&rsquo;s the imperialist agenda.</p>
<p>Going back to, I&rsquo;m sorry, where we left our discussion off,</p>
<p>I mean, I was gonna go on with America</p>
<p>not only being censored, closed down now, closed down.</p>
<p>And you say it&rsquo;s not fear, well, it is fear.</p>
<p>I am scared, because if you get your Facebook page</p>
<p>suspended or your YouTube, your Twitter account thrown off,</p>
<p>a lot of good people are getting there, thrown off.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t speak out, it affects your business.</p>
<p>It goes back to the 1950s when my father&rsquo;s world,</p>
<p>when you could not express any sympathy for a Soviet Union</p>
<p>without endangering your job,</p>
<p>without basically being not trusted.</p>
<p>You had to be part of the program to get along, to go along.</p>
<p>Same thing when the United Kingdom,</p>
<p>I mean, for all their talk, this Boris Johnson is an idiot.</p>
<p>But all their talk about, do you remember their policies</p>
<p>with the IRA in Ireland when Ireland was threatening them?</p>
<p>They cut off the IRA completely.</p>
<p>Gerry Adams, who was a wonderful guy, I met him,</p>
<p>was not allowed to even be heard in Britain</p>
<p>during certain years.</p>
<p>In France, all constantly through the Algerian War,</p>
<p>the Algerians were not allowed to be heard.</p>
<p>The Algerian War for Independence divided France greatly.</p>
<p>You could not even show Paths of Glory,</p>
<p>World War I film in France for, I don&rsquo;t know, 20 years</p>
<p>after it came out.</p>
<p>Censorship is a way of life</p>
<p>when democracies also feel threatened.</p>
<p>They are much more fragile than they pretend to be.</p>
<p>A healthy democracy would take all the criticism</p>
<p>in the world and shrug it off and say,</p>
<p>okay, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s good about our country.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;d like to see that in America.</p>
<p>There are times that it&rsquo;s been like that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s so scary now.</p>
<p>So it is scary, that&rsquo;s what I was trying to say.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not unscary to me.</p>
<p>In China, I would say to you, yes, it&rsquo;s much scarier to me</p>
<p>because there is the internet wall that they cut off,</p>
<p>and I got into problems in China too</p>
<p>because I said something years ago</p>
<p>about you have to discover your own history.</p>
<p>You have to be honest about Mao.</p>
<p>You have to go back and let&rsquo;s make a movie about Mao.</p>
<p>That upset them and show his negatives.</p>
<p>So China has been much more sensitive than Russia</p>
<p>about criticism, much more.</p>
<p>And it is a source of problems, but on the other hand,</p>
<p>China has a lot of grievances,</p>
<p>a lot going back to the 19th century</p>
<p>and the British imperialism of that era</p>
<p>and the American imperialism.</p>
<p>If you could talk to Vladimir Putin once again now,</p>
<p>what kind of things would you talk about here?</p>
<p>What kind of questions would you ask?</p>
<p>Huh, well, one thing I would certainly ask</p>
<p>is what you were thinking on February 23,</p>
<p>and I would ask him to reply to my question</p>
<p>about what if you took this to phase two.</p>
<p>You surrendered in Donbass.</p>
<p>You had no ego about it.</p>
<p>You just surrendered.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in your interest to your country,</p>
<p>and you invited all the refugees from Donbass into Russia</p>
<p>as much as they can.</p>
<p>What would you do now?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the US next move in your opinion?</p>
<p>How are you gonna, okay, where are we gonna go?</p>
<p>That would be the key question because it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>but he didn&rsquo;t go that way.</p>
<p>He chose to take the sanctions and to go this way.</p>
<p>Why he did that is a key question for our time.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was a mistake.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was his judgment.</p>
<p>Perhaps, as I said, but I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>knowing the man I did, I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I think it was calculated.</p>
<p>Now this is projection and speculation,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something different about him</p>
<p>in the past several months.</p>
<p>It could be the COVID thing,</p>
<p>the isolation that you mentioned.</p>
<p>I listen to a lot of interviews and speeches in Russian,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s something about power over time</p>
<p>that can change you, that can isolate you.</p>
<p>Well, when I was there,</p>
<p>no, he&rsquo;d been in office for already 15 years.</p>
<p>He had power.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t misuse it in my opinion.</p>
<p>He was very even.</p>
<p>I saw him go on television and talk to his fellows</p>
<p>the same way he always talked to them.</p>
<p>He grew in intelligence and knowledge</p>
<p>because he had dealings with the whole world.</p>
<p>Now people had come to him.</p>
<p>He was very well known in Africa and Middle East,</p>
<p>certainly Syria, and I just never saw misuse of his power.</p>
<p>I saw humility in him, actually.</p>
<p>So perhaps there was a calculation and he calculated wrong</p>
<p>in terms of what happens if he doesn&rsquo;t invade.</p>
<p>Perhaps there was a calculation,</p>
<p>perhaps he had a calm and clear mind,</p>
<p>and he calculated wrong.</p>
<p>Well, he also made the point that he,</p>
<p>the talk of Zelensky saying,</p>
<p>well, nuclear weapons were gonna come into Ukraine.</p>
<p>There was talk about that right before the invasion too,</p>
<p>and certainly that would have set off alarms.</p>
<p>You know, the United States is already kind of doing that</p>
<p>by not only putting its intelligence</p>
<p>and its heavy weaponry into Ukraine,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve got to deal with the question,</p>
<p>the next question that comes up,</p>
<p>the most immediate question is,</p>
<p>is the United States gonna start?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m saying this is good.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re making a lot of noise in United States press</p>
<p>about Russia using nuclear weapons and chemical weapons.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of noise.</p>
<p>Again, going back to my analogy,</p>
<p>when the United States starts that,</p>
<p>it starts the conversation going.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the interest of the United States</p>
<p>for Russia to be pinned with any kind of chemical</p>
<p>or nuclear incident.</p>
<p>Except, for example, it&rsquo;d be very, not simple,</p>
<p>but it would be possible to explode a nuclear device</p>
<p>in Donbass and kill thousands of people.</p>
<p>And we would not know right away who did it,</p>
<p>but of course the blame would go right to Russia,</p>
<p>right to Russia, even if it didn&rsquo;t make sense,</p>
<p>if there was no motivation for it.</p>
<p>It would just be blamed on Russia.</p>
<p>The United States might well be the one</p>
<p>who does that false flag operation.</p>
<p>It would not be beyond them.</p>
<p>It would be a very dramatic solution</p>
<p>to sealing this war off as a major victory</p>
<p>for the United States.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s terrifying.</p>
<p>No, but it can happen.</p>
<p>It can happen.</p>
<p>A one kiloton device, low yield, it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>So when you walk across that line,</p>
<p>you can potentially never walk back.</p>
<p>Well, I think the United States is calculating</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a dangerous, yes, I agree,</p>
<p>but I think the neoconservative arrogance is such</p>
<p>that they really believe they can push their advantage</p>
<p>to the max now because of all these propaganda successes</p>
<p>up to now.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian army could be wiped out for all we know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all this leftists or neo, Nazi brigades,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re being advised very well by US</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re sending the weapons in,</p>
<p>are huge amounts of weapons.</p>
<p>What about American budget?</p>
<p>No one talks about how much money we&rsquo;re giving to Ukraine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a billion dollars already in weaponry</p>
<p>and not most of it just poured in.</p>
<p>What about, you know, the Russian budget is,</p>
<p>defense budget is 60 some billion dollars a year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nothing compared to the United States, 1 15th of it.</p>
<p>But yet we&rsquo;ve put so much weaponry into Ukraine.</p>
<p>The money we&rsquo;ve spent on Ukraine is equivalent almost</p>
<p>to what we spent on COVID in our own country.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s astounding the distortion of our priorities.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also chemical.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget chemical is probably the easier way to go.</p>
<p>But in Syria, there was far too many incidents of America</p>
<p>in its quest to demonize Assad and the Russians</p>
<p>of all these chemical attacks that were happening</p>
<p>that they were vowing came from Russia.</p>
<p>And in spite of the fact that Russia just pulled out of the,</p>
<p>signed the agreement on chemical arms</p>
<p>and apparently destroyed its stock several years ago,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s strange that the strangest incidents happened in Syria.</p>
<p>You go back to them, trace every one,</p>
<p>good journalism was done.</p>
<p>The White Helmets got a lot of fame,</p>
<p>but they were corrupted.</p>
<p>And many good journalists tried to point out</p>
<p>the inconsistencies in the American accusations.</p>
<p>Robert Parry among them,</p>
<p>who was one of my mentors at Consortium Press.</p>
<p>A lot of good, you&rsquo;d have to go back,</p>
<p>but trace each, like you would trace each time</p>
<p>they made an accusation against Putin of murder.</p>
<p>You need that same kind of Sherlock Holmes intensity,</p>
<p>investigation, and they don&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>because the United Nations or the chemical,</p>
<p>not the United Nations as much as the chemical people,</p>
<p>the organization has been tampered with.</p>
<p>If you remember correctly, there was accusations</p>
<p>that the chemical investigative unit,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the name of it, was tampered with.</p>
<p>And people quit, people who were working on that commission</p>
<p>quit and said that this is not legit.</p>
<p>So very interesting, that Syria story is wacko.</p>
<p>So the United States is willing</p>
<p>to use chemical in Syria freely.</p>
<p>It did it three, four times.</p>
<p>If you remember correctly, Trump was challenged</p>
<p>that he did not attack after a chemical incident in Syria.</p>
<p>All these newscasters in the United States,</p>
<p>the most heaviest of them were saying,</p>
<p>well, President Trump is now finally acting</p>
<p>like a real president when he attacks,</p>
<p>when he drops missiles in Syria.</p>
<p>They actually said that.</p>
<p>In other words, they wanted Trump to go to war on Syria,</p>
<p>but he didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Chemical weapons and nuclear is really terrifying.</p>
<p>Do you think, now combine this with the fascinating choice</p>
<p>in your interviews with Vladimir Putin</p>
<p>to watch Stanley Kubrick&rsquo;s Dr. Strangelove</p>
<p>or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.</p>
<p>And given the fact that you did that,</p>
<p>now looking at the fact that the word nuclear,</p>
<p>and it feels like the world hangs</p>
<p>on the brink of nuclear war,</p>
<p>do you think that that&rsquo;s overstating the case?</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s what worried me from the beginning,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s probably why I got involved in all this stuff,</p>
<p>because I go back to the 60s when we were so close</p>
<p>to nuclear war.</p>
<p>I lived through that period,</p>
<p>and I thought, as many people did,</p>
<p>that this was, it was gonna come now.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve lived through that,</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t sense the period in 83</p>
<p>when Reagan took us to the edge,</p>
<p>if you remember correctly.</p>
<p>Able Archer was an exercise that almost brought us to,</p>
<p>because the Russians were really paranoid at that point,</p>
<p>and they were responding to our military exercise</p>
<p>on Able Archer.</p>
<p>There was also the Korean airliner, they went down.</p>
<p>There were numerous incidents in the 80s,</p>
<p>but I never felt the fear.</p>
<p>I thought Reagan was testing the limits,</p>
<p>but perhaps if I&rsquo;d been younger, I would&rsquo;ve felt it.</p>
<p>But anyway, no, we come close.</p>
<p>The United States has risked this several times.</p>
<p>If I told you, it would be hard for you to believe,</p>
<p>if I could set a scene for you in a drama in 1962</p>
<p>when Kennedy has a meeting with the Joint Chiefs of Staff</p>
<p>and the CIA, and they talk about a plan,</p>
<p>a military plan, to first strike the Soviet Union and China.</p>
<p>It was an Eisenhower plan that had been put into potential</p>
<p>operation in early 60s or 50s, late 50s, SIOP 62.</p>
<p>This was an attack on the Soviet Union, first strike.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the United States has never given up</p>
<p>the concept of first strike.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that the Russian nuclear policy posture</p>
<p>is more defensive than the American one,</p>
<p>which leaves options open.</p>
<p>The same options are open in neoconservative agreements</p>
<p>that we see from the late 90s, where they say,</p>
<p>the emergence of a rival power will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very broad statement,</p>
<p>and it allows you to do a lot, including nuclear.</p>
<p>So you have to understand the United States is always,</p>
<p>first of all, it breaks so many treaties.</p>
<p>We know that from the Putin story</p>
<p>about the Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002,</p>
<p>and then the INF Treaty of, they broke that one.</p>
<p>That was the intermediate missiles.</p>
<p>That was 2019.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when they broke it off,</p>
<p>but the United States has not been very faithful</p>
<p>on its nuclear agreements, and so I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that we can even deal with the United States diplomatically.</p>
<p>It seems to be impossible.</p>
<p>Now, it brings me to Biden.</p>
<p>And this is the opposite of Kennedy.</p>
<p>Kennedy was a Catholic Irish anti imperialist.</p>
<p>Biden seems to be the opposite.</p>
<p>He seems to be a get along, go along guy</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been not only old,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s also gone along with this program,</p>
<p>which I voted for Biden because I feared Trump,</p>
<p>but I thought Biden at a certain age would mellow.</p>
<p>I really did.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not mellowed, apparently.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s still listening to these people, and he believes them.</p>
<p>And it seems that his, that horrible woman,</p>
<p>Victoria Nuland, who was Under Secretary of State,</p>
<p>he appointed her to this sector of the world.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s very influential,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s been one of the worst people on Ukraine.</p>
<p>Obviously, she&rsquo;s behind the coup.</p>
<p>She was the one who boasted that, you know,</p>
<p>we got our man in, Yats, whatever it is, Yatsenuk.</p>
<p>And also, remember the famous statement, fuck the EU?</p>
<p>All these things, but she&rsquo;s back,</p>
<p>and she said the other day about if the Soviets,</p>
<p>if the Russians use nuclear weaponry of any kind,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gonna be a horrible price to pay.</p>
<p>She was out of the blue.</p>
<p>I said, what the hell is she doing?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s talking nuclear all of a sudden.</p>
<p>And then since that day, everybody in the US press,</p>
<p>all the shows have gone, talk nuclear, nuclear, nuclear.</p>
<p>Secretary of State has done it, Blinken, it scares you.</p>
<p>If you think about it, the United States scares me.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the military industrial complex machine,</p>
<p>fully functional, fully operational</p>
<p>behind this whole thing.</p>
<p>Certainly is.</p>
<p>Is that what&rsquo;s to blame?</p>
<p>Certainly is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I showed him Strangelove,</p>
<p>because I wanted him to show him.</p>
<p>I wanted Mr. Putin to say, look at this film.</p>
<p>You never saw it.</p>
<p>How can you not say, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a seminal film in American history</p>
<p>to those people who care.</p>
<p>And it shows you the Kubrick had a pacifist, thank God,</p>
<p>antiwar mentality, which he showed in Bows of Glory</p>
<p>as well as Strangelove.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s such a dire, well done scenario</p>
<p>that I wanted Mr. Putin to be aware</p>
<p>of the way the United States thinks.</p>
<p>Yeah, the absurdity of escalation,</p>
<p>the absurdity of war at the largest scale,</p>
<p>the absurdity of nuclear war, especially.</p>
<p>Can we walk back from the brink of nuclear war?</p>
<p>Can we?</p>
<p>Yes, yes we can.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the path to walk back?</p>
<p>Reason.</p>
<p>Between who and whom?</p>
<p>Reason and diplomacy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason.</p>
<p>I mean, talk to the guy.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden, why don&rsquo;t you calm down</p>
<p>and go and talk to Mr. Putin in Moscow?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you just sit across the table from him</p>
<p>and try to have a discussion without falling</p>
<p>into ideologies and stuff like that?</p>
<p>Can I ask you for advice?</p>
<p>You did some of the most difficult interviews ever.</p>
<p>Do you have advice that you can give to someone like me</p>
<p>or anyone hoping to understand something</p>
<p>about a human being sitting across from them</p>
<p>about what it takes to do a good interview?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing one.</p>
<p>Well, no, but there&rsquo;s a, listen,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s levels to this game.</p>
<p>And interviewing somebody like Vladimir Putin,</p>
<p>also language barrier, sit across from the man,</p>
<p>try to keep an open mind,</p>
<p>try to also ask challenging questions,</p>
<p>but not challenging with an agenda,</p>
<p>but seeking to understand and understand deeply.</p>
<p>How do you do that?</p>
<p>Seeking the truth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very simple.</p>
<p>Seeking the truth, being a questioner like you are.</p>
<p>You wanna know what is really going on.</p>
<p>I could not get anywhere with Biden or Bush</p>
<p>or for that matter, Obama.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d be opaque with me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no interview possible</p>
<p>with the president of the United States</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s got to stand for all the stuff</p>
<p>that they stand for, which is imperialism,</p>
<p>which is control of the world.</p>
<p>How can you defend that?</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s gonna come out and say that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re always gonna blame the enemy.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna blame Iran.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna blame China.</p>
<p>So with some people, it may not be possible</p>
<p>to break through the opaqueness.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, have you ever seen an interview with the president</p>
<p>besides being personable,</p>
<p>where he actually discussed American policy?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, not really, but maybe after their president.</p>
<p>I could see Obama being able to do such an interview.</p>
<p>I could see George W. being able to do such an interview.</p>
<p>Or are they not able to reflect at all on the?</p>
<p>George W. hasn&rsquo;t shown much conscience</p>
<p>in terms of thinking about what he&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve seen that.</p>
<p>You ever see my movie, W.?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s one of my best movies</p>
<p>because it shows a man who&rsquo;s just out of his depth</p>
<p>and has no, he has a conscience at the end of the movie.</p>
<p>If you remember correctly, he talks to his wife</p>
<p>and he says, I don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to do good in the world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done, I believe in good and right.</p>
<p>And why do people not understand that kind of complaint</p>
<p>as if he can&rsquo;t get outside himself</p>
<p>to understand the way other people think?</p>
<p>Empathies, walking like a dramatist is what I do.</p>
<p>You walk in the footsteps of other people.</p>
<p>When I did a movie about Richard Nixon,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t because I liked him.</p>
<p>It was because I wanted to,</p>
<p>I think I understood a part of him because of my father</p>
<p>and I think I wanted to walk in his footsteps.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say I sympathize with him because I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he helped the American cause at all,</p>
<p>but it was empathize as opposed to sympathize.</p>
<p>Same thing with Bush.</p>
<p>People were shocked when I did the Bush movie.</p>
<p>They said, how can you be in any way receptive to this guy?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>Dramatists don&rsquo;t have political positions.</p>
<p>They walk in the shoes of.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why Bush movie perhaps was surprising</p>
<p>and many people didn&rsquo;t care for it.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s what, but that&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;ve got to go there.</p>
<p>If you did a movie about a villain, you have to go there.</p>
<p>You have to walk in their shoes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So see them, cause they usually,</p>
<p>villains usually see themselves as the hero.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So you have to consider what is it like to live in a world</p>
<p>where this person is the hero?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Is that a burden?</p>
<p>Is that hard?</p>
<p>Not for George W. Bush.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s bitching because they didn&rsquo;t understand him,</p>
<p>but he had a good vision he said of democracy</p>
<p>and you know, democracy forgives a lot of sins.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a hard question on that?</p>
<p>Yes, sure.</p>
<p>So because empathy is so important to a great interview,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s ask the most challenging version of empathy,</p>
<p>which is when you&rsquo;re sitting across from a man</p>
<p>on the brink of war that leads to tens of millions</p>
<p>of deaths, which is Hitler.</p>
<p>So if you could interview Hitler in 1939,</p>
<p>as the drums of war start to beat or 1941</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re already full on war, but there&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>a lot of pacifists, there&rsquo;s still a lot of people unsure</p>
<p>what are the motivations behind what Hitler&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>How would you do that interview?</p>
<p>Well it depends when you do it.</p>
<p>If you do it in 38, I certainly would have,</p>
<p>no you have to, if you sit down across from Hitler,</p>
<p>you empathize.</p>
<p>What is your beef?</p>
<p>Where have you been?</p>
<p>What is your consciousness?</p>
<p>Why do you hate Jewish people?</p>
<p>Why, what is, all these questions that come up.</p>
<p>His sense of grievance as a result of World War I.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s justifications there, et cetera.</p>
<p>But if I, and by the way, Churchill was trying</p>
<p>to make a deal with him in 38.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fact that people don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Churchill himself, there was still the desire</p>
<p>in England to make peace with Germany.</p>
<p>And it was seen as a possible, what Churchill</p>
<p>really wanted was Hitler to go against Russia.</p>
<p>And anything to destroy the Bolsheviks.</p>
<p>So he was using Hitler as much as he could</p>
<p>to go after Russia, but Hitler was too elusive</p>
<p>to get, to pin him down.</p>
<p>But if you remember, Hitler was very kind at the end of,</p>
<p>kind is not the right word, was,</p>
<p>did not go after the British Empire when he had France.</p>
<p>And he could have.</p>
<p>He had another objective, which was obviously the East.</p>
<p>So Hitler&rsquo;s goal, I think, he always had an admiration</p>
<p>for England.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting story, always.</p>
<p>And the empire.</p>
<p>Yes, and certainly Churchill, we have no doubts now</p>
<p>from history revisionism that Churchill&rsquo;s interest,</p>
<p>main interest, was not Germany.</p>
<p>It was the British Empire.</p>
<p>And to preserve it to India, the road to India</p>
<p>and all that, and Middle East.</p>
<p>Churchill fought the entire war with the concept</p>
<p>of preserving the British Empire.</p>
<p>All his goals, he sent America on a goose chase into Italy,</p>
<p>you could argue, instead of establishing</p>
<p>a sincere second front in Western Europe.</p>
<p>Interesting man.</p>
<p>So I would have tried to get, you know,</p>
<p>I think I would have approached it the same way.</p>
<p>In 1939, it would have been a different story</p>
<p>because at that point, he&rsquo;d attacked Poland,</p>
<p>and in 1940, France.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s another ball game.</p>
<p>But certainly, at whatever point you talk to him,</p>
<p>I would try to understand his point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not judging you, Hitler.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying to you, tell me what you&rsquo;re thinking.</p>
<p>Why are you invading Russia?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your thought?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all an interviewer should do.</p>
<p>He shouldn&rsquo;t be expressing his contempt for Hitler,</p>
<p>which like an American journalist interviewing Putin,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting brownie points for expressing my contempt for you.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t wash with me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s ugly.</p>
<p>Seek to understand.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>This is a technical question,</p>
<p>but was language a barrier as an interviewer?</p>
<p>To some degree.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to learn Russian.</p>
<p>But I had very, they have excellent translators</p>
<p>in the Kremlin, excellent.</p>
<p>They are people who are trained very seriously</p>
<p>for months or years before they,</p>
<p>these people are young and they&rsquo;re very bright.</p>
<p>I was very impressed with the Russian translators.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m impressed as well,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a humor that&rsquo;s lost.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a wit, a dry wit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s stuff said between the lines.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not actually how much content,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s more kind of the things</p>
<p>that make communication more frictionless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the, there&rsquo;s a kind of sadness to a Russian humor</p>
<p>that permeates all things.</p>
<p>And that sometimes is lost in translation.</p>
<p>The translation is a little bit colder,</p>
<p>meaning it just conveys the facts.</p>
<p>Would you call it sardonic humor?</p>
<p>I would say so, yeah.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>But I think you could see that from facial expressions</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re sitting across from the person</p>
<p>and you can feel it.</p>
<p>I feel it, yeah.</p>
<p>You can feel it.</p>
<p>Let me ask you in general,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the role of love in the human condition,</p>
<p>in your life, in life in general?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked, you looked at some of the darkest aspect</p>
<p>of human nature.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of this,</p>
<p>one of the more beautiful aspects of human nature?</p>
<p>I think without love, I wouldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be able to carry on.</p>
<p>I think that love is my, love is the greatest,</p>
<p>the ability to love is the greatest virtue you can have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the ability to share with another,</p>
<p>with your family, with your children, with your wife,</p>
<p>with your lover, your partner.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an ability to extend yourself into the world</p>
<p>and it brings empathy with it.</p>
<p>If you love well,</p>
<p>I think you expand it to the human race too.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the strength behind the great novelists,</p>
<p>the great artists of our time.</p>
<p>I think part of the reason I suppose</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re scared of science sometimes</p>
<p>is because the scientists sometimes</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t express that clearly.</p>
<p>You can lose that when you focus on the facts,</p>
<p>on empirical data, on the science of things.</p>
<p>You can lose the humanity that&rsquo;s between the lines.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m often struck by when I talk to scientists</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve talked to a few,</p>
<p>that how arrogant they can be about,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t talk to you if you don&rsquo;t understand their world</p>
<p>and they talk to each other and there&rsquo;s an arrogance,</p>
<p>a closed circle kind of thing.</p>
<p>Oh, he&rsquo;s not at my level, I can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no discussion to be had with this person,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a human being.</p>
<p>That arrogance is terrifying to me</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s next door neighbor to closed mindedness</p>
<p>which then can be used by charismatic leaders</p>
<p>as it was in Nazi Germany</p>
<p>to commit some of the worst atrocities.</p>
<p>The scientists can be used as pawns</p>
<p>in a very cruel game.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to young people?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve done, first of all, some of the greatest films ever.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve lived a heck of a life.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve, were fearless and bold</p>
<p>in asking some really difficult questions of this world.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to young people today,</p>
<p>high school, college, about career?</p>
<p>How to have a career they can be proud of</p>
<p>or how to have a life they can be proud of?</p>
<p>Well, I have three children</p>
<p>so obviously I&rsquo;m not necessarily the best advisor</p>
<p>in the world and I do find that the children,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve raised them with a sense of freedom</p>
<p>and they do what they want.</p>
<p>In the end, it&rsquo;s their life, their destiny, their character.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what comes out.</p>
<p>You can try to influence it</p>
<p>but you can try to get your daughter to wake up</p>
<p>at a certain hour in the day but it never works.</p>
<p>So I long ago gave up on that</p>
<p>and my children are all grown now</p>
<p>but aside from that, I think if I was a teacher in a school</p>
<p>and teaching film, I&rsquo;d say to the students,</p>
<p>get an education.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just look at film because it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a full education, it&rsquo;s not the spectrum.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you should teach film as a,</p>
<p>I think you need a base in other worlds.</p>
<p>One of the greatest courses I took at NYU was,</p>
<p>and I was a war veteran on the GI Bill</p>
<p>so I was older than the other students.</p>
<p>One of the great, I took a class outside the film school</p>
<p>in Greek classics because I hadn&rsquo;t had much history</p>
<p>and I wanted to know more about the world of Homer</p>
<p>and so forth and the teacher opened my eyes</p>
<p>to so much in that class and I wrote about it</p>
<p>in my memoir, it&rsquo;s called Chasing the Light</p>
<p>about Professor Leahy and what he did to me.</p>
<p>He gave me the concepts clearly of consciousness</p>
<p>which is the Homeric theme of Odysseus</p>
<p>and also lethe, L E T H E, which is sleep</p>
<p>and how most of the crew, Odysseus&rsquo;s crew,</p>
<p>were experiencing lethe and how necessary it was</p>
<p>to stay awake.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just film, it&rsquo;s just you have to learn</p>
<p>the world as much as you can when you&rsquo;re young</p>
<p>and so that I think is the basis of a good education</p>
<p>and a classic one is important, a basis.</p>
<p>I think then you go on and you can learn computer</p>
<p>if you want but that&rsquo;s specialization.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a computer geek, is that a life?</p>
<p>Does that give you enough satisfaction?</p>
<p>Do you get the joy out of people?</p>
<p>No, just like filmmaking is a skill.</p>
<p>Yes, right.</p>
<p>You have the broad background to understand the world,</p>
<p>literature, history.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So one of the things about being human is life is finite.</p>
<p>It ends.</p>
<p>Do you think about your death?</p>
<p>Are you afraid of your death?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>Absolutely, you have to come to terms with death</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a tough one for many people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m older than you, obviously,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m getting closer to it.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t happen any day, actually.</p>
<p>When you get to a certain age,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t assume that you&rsquo;re gonna be alive tomorrow.</p>
<p>So I try to deal with that.</p>
<p>Are you afraid of it?</p>
<p>Much less so than I was when I was younger.</p>
<p>Remember, I was in Vietnam</p>
<p>but I thought I dealt with it there</p>
<p>but when I came back, I realized that I wanted to live.</p>
<p>So yes, I&rsquo;ve learned over time</p>
<p>to get more and more used to it and get ready for it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a good answer to the question of why live?</p>
<p>So the realization that you wanted to live.</p>
<p>What was the reason to live?</p>
<p>Because it was better than being one of those corpses</p>
<p>that I saw in the jungle.</p>
<p>I saw how finite death is.</p>
<p>Are there things in your life you regret?</p>
<p>Oh, sure.</p>
<p>Too many.</p>
<p>Is there something you wish you could have done differently?</p>
<p>Like if you could go back to do one thing differently</p>
<p>or that it regrets all of it.</p>
<p>Did you ask Musk this?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious.</p>
<p>What did he say?</p>
<p>Offline all the time.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be curious to know.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s an engineer too</p>
<p>and engineers really value mistakes.</p>
<p>Engineers value mistakes.</p>
<p>Value mistakes and errors</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s an opportunity to learn.</p>
<p>I mean, this is what you do with systems</p>
<p>is you test them, then test them, then test them</p>
<p>and errors is just information.</p>
<p>He did that with the rockets.</p>
<p>That is true in its way of filmmaking.</p>
<p>There are certain things you learn as you build films</p>
<p>and you make mistakes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like putting an engine together and you,</p>
<p>oh, the film is flawed in that way, you know it.</p>
<p>Other people may or may not see it,</p>
<p>but the car runs or it made money or it didn&rsquo;t make money.</p>
<p>It can be good and it didn&rsquo;t make money,</p>
<p>but the point is that everything is a build.</p>
<p>Every film is a construction.</p>
<p>Same thing as he goes through on a Tesla,</p>
<p>we go through on each film.</p>
<p>But films are art.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little tricky.</p>
<p>Yeah, the thing is one film does not lead</p>
<p>to a lifetime guarantee of copyright.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, you have the movie game as you&rsquo;ve called it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complicated and cruel game.</p>
<p>But it takes enormous amount of work,</p>
<p>enormous amount of work to make a film.</p>
<p>People underestimate that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely complicated to have something be successful</p>
<p>because it has so many elements of luck involved</p>
<p>and reception and so forth.</p>
<p>What do you think, I apologize for the absurd question,</p>
<p>but what do you think is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Why are we here?</p>
<p>The why.</p>
<p>I think to realize ourselves,</p>
<p>to realize more of what you are,</p>
<p>to realize what life is, to appreciate it,</p>
<p>to grow, to honor our life,</p>
<p>to honor the concept of life</p>
<p>and to understand how precious life is.</p>
<p>The preciousness of life, as the Buddhists say.</p>
<p>And of course, the immediacy of death all around us.</p>
<p>The causes of death are all around us.</p>
<p>And our life is like, as they say,</p>
<p>is like a lantern in a strong breeze existing</p>
<p>among the causes of death.</p>
<p>So life is so precious.</p>
<p>And at the same time, the immediacy of death</p>
<p>and then of course, the continuation of life</p>
<p>in whatever form it&rsquo;s gonna take.</p>
<p>But in this life, to wake up to the preciousness of it.</p>
<p>To the preciousness.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a wonderful thing, by the way.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have that when I was young.</p>
<p>I took it for granted.</p>
<p>Oliver, like I said, I&rsquo;m a huge fan.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an incredible human being,</p>
<p>one of the greatest artists ever.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a huge honor that you sit with me</p>
<p>and talk so deeply and honestly</p>
<p>about some very difficult topics.</p>
<p>Again, you&rsquo;re an inspiration and it&rsquo;s an honor</p>
<p>that you will spend your valuable time with me.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Thanks for talking to me.</p>
<p>Fun being here.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Oliver Stone.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Oliver Stone in the untold history</p>
<p>of the United States.</p>
<p>To fail is not tragic.</p>
<p>To be human is.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
