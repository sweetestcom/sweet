    <p>All right, everybody, welcome to another episode of the all in</p>
<p>podcast episode number 70. We made it to 70 episodes, which is</p>
<p>just shocking to me. And we&rsquo;re recording a little bit earlier,</p>
<p>because one of our besties had to change their schedule,</p>
<p>Chamath. And it&rsquo;s a crazy day to be doing this last night, Putin</p>
<p>decided to invade the Ukraine. Late Wednesday night, early to</p>
<p>Thursday morning, Putin started a special military operation in</p>
<p>quotes to demilitarize the Ukraine. And we&rsquo;ve been watching</p>
<p>this build up for weeks.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re missing it. He said to demilitarize and denazify.</p>
<p>And denazify. Yes, of course. Because the Ukraine was filled</p>
<p>with so many Nazis. His trolling continues. I guess just starting</p>
<p>it off. Sax, you&rsquo;re a big Putin fan, along with Truncheon. You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the right wing. So tell us how glorious is this invasion from</p>
<p>the Republican Party?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting what it&rsquo;s, well, that&rsquo;s funny. But it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also, it&rsquo;s also kind of sad, because what you&rsquo;re doing right</p>
<p>there is exactly what the whole Twittersphere is doing, which is</p>
<p>anybody who wants to actually deescalate and defuse this war</p>
<p>before it escalates and metastasizes and something much</p>
<p>worse gets denounced as a Putin apologist. I have no dealings in</p>
<p>either, you know, Russia or Ukraine, for that matter,</p>
<p>Ukrainian cash is not lining my pockets, like many of our</p>
<p>politicians, their families in Washington, I have no interest</p>
<p>except preserving the safety of the United States of America.</p>
<p>And the point is that I think Biden, the one clear, elusive</p>
<p>point that he made in his last speech, I know he&rsquo;s giving one</p>
<p>today is that the United States of America would not intervene</p>
<p>militarily in Ukraine, we should all understand that he made it</p>
<p>very clear. The troops that were being sent over there were</p>
<p>to defend our NATO allies. Ukraine is not one we do not</p>
<p>have a treaty obligation to defend them. What is happening</p>
<p>right now is tragic. Putin is the aggressor. It&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>humanitarian disaster. I do feel bad for the people of Ukraine,</p>
<p>our thoughts and prayers are with them. However, we are not</p>
<p>going to intervene militarily in that conflict, nor should we</p>
<p>because we cannot risk starting World War Three. It is not a</p>
<p>vital American interest, who rules the Donbass in a way that</p>
<p>it is a vital American interest to avoid a war with Russia. And</p>
<p>the tragedy here, the second tragedy is that we did not do</p>
<p>everything we could to diplomatically try and solve</p>
<p>this problem. And what do I mean by that on the spot three weeks</p>
<p>ago, I said that Ukraine was never gonna be part of NATO. Why?</p>
<p>Because Biden just said it, we can&rsquo;t defend them militarily</p>
<p>against Russia, we were never going to admit them. Why didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>we give up that card that we don&rsquo;t know for sure what would</p>
<p>happen. But if we had been willing to basically affirm that</p>
<p>we believe in Ukraine sovereignty, but they are not</p>
<p>going to be part of NATO, that might have diffused this</p>
<p>conflict.</p>
<p>I think we had consensus on that we said, like, hey, what if I</p>
<p>think actually, I suggested, what if we set a five year, you</p>
<p>know, moratorium on them joining or something like that out</p>
<p>there?</p>
<p>Can I just ask one question on this? Okay, yeah. Saxe, do you</p>
<p>not think that the US, you know, regardless of the obligations</p>
<p>under NATO, faces a little bit of an issue on a global stage</p>
<p>where, you know, we told this leader back down, don&rsquo;t do this,</p>
<p>and then we don&rsquo;t respond militarily, that that action</p>
<p>effectively reduces America&rsquo;s influence and credibility, when</p>
<p>it comes to these sorts of defensive statements, in this</p>
<p>kind of global theatre, and our primacy is being challenged</p>
<p>because we lay down the law, we said, this is not allowed, you</p>
<p>cannot do this, there&rsquo;s going to be repercussions. And then it</p>
<p>happens, and there are economic sanctions. And, you know, maybe</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk in a second about some other potential</p>
<p>repercussions. But by not doing something militarily, we weaken</p>
<p>ourselves and we weaken our position, and it gives</p>
<p>permission to others to take action that may be counter</p>
<p>ultimately to kind of the US interests abroad.</p>
<p>Okay, so in response, I have to quote what Barack Obama said.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve mentioned this on a previous pod, he said, the fact</p>
<p>is that Ukraine, which is, and this is back in the Atlantic</p>
<p>interview, he gave the fact is that Ukraine, which is a non</p>
<p>NATO countries can be vulnerable to military domination by</p>
<p>Russia, no matter what we do. This is an example where we have</p>
<p>to be very clear about what our core interests are, and what we</p>
<p>are willing to go to war for. The fact of the matter is, none</p>
<p>of us on this pod want to send our sons and daughters to go</p>
<p>fight and risk their lives and die to determine who rules the</p>
<p>Donbass or even Ukraine, we sympathize with them, we may</p>
<p>impose sanctions on their behalf, we may arm the</p>
<p>militarily, but we are not willing to fight. And so</p>
<p>therefore, us trying to lay down this law to Putin was a bluff,</p>
<p>and he called our bluff. And the smart thing we can do right now</p>
<p>is not to escalate. Look, we&rsquo;ve already gone to the river. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>caught, you know, we basically tried to barrel and bluff him at</p>
<p>every street, we got to the river, he has now invaded, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>now in a showdown. What do you want to do now you want to</p>
<p>escalate this even more, the only way that we could make this</p>
<p>worse is to precipitate a world war. Now, if our absolute</p>
<p>priority, our absolute priority right now should be to make sure</p>
<p>that this war doesn&rsquo;t spread.</p>
<p>My prediction is as of right now, it would be very unpopular</p>
<p>to go to war, or for the US to enter the war in a on the</p>
<p>battlefield, I do think, and I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>hear more about this today. But I do think that the cyber war is</p>
<p>beginning today. The United States has talked at length</p>
<p>about having, you know, tremendous cyber capabilities.</p>
<p>And my understanding is, as of this morning, a number of state</p>
<p>websites were down in Russia, and a number of, you know,</p>
<p>Russian cyber interests were under attack. And so we may see</p>
<p>the US kind of confront Russia on another battle stage, not on</p>
<p>the, you know, on the field on the physical field. But if over</p>
<p>the next couple of weeks, this continues or days, and I was</p>
<p>just looking at CNN this morning and BBC, and there were these</p>
<p>images that started to come out of like, you know, Ukrainian</p>
<p>airplanes that had been downed. And if you start to see images</p>
<p>of children, you know, helpless children, buildings being</p>
<p>bombed, bodies strewn on the street, does that not change</p>
<p>kind of the American opinion on whether or not we should do</p>
<p>something here? And will that not kind of lead us potentially</p>
<p>into a war that, you know, today, I think we all, you know,</p>
<p>where many people would say strategically doesn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>economically doesn&rsquo;t make sense. You know, we&rsquo;re only</p>
<p>going to lead to kind of escalation. But don&rsquo;t you think</p>
<p>that American opinion typically changes when imagery arises when</p>
<p>you know, the sort of brutality of war?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, that&rsquo;s kind of block images out of some wars</p>
<p>and we have in the past. Yeah.</p>
<p>But even today, it&rsquo;s like the first day and there&rsquo;s like these</p>
<p>really gruesome, awful photos coming out. And I could see</p>
<p>people getting sympathetic to that and starting to kind of,</p>
<p>you know, bang the, the war drum saying this is ridiculous. We</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t let this tyrant do this. It&rsquo;s awful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already happening, you know, but this is why we should</p>
<p>not conduct foreign policy by Twitter. We should not</p>
<p>Twitterize the situation. Yeah, this is when cooler heads need</p>
<p>to prevail. The fact of the matter is when Soviet tanks,</p>
<p>they rolled into Hungary in 1956 or Czechoslovakia in 1968</p>
<p>to crush the Prague Spring or Poland in 1981 across solidarity.</p>
<p>We did nothing because avoiding war with the Soviet Union was</p>
<p>more important, even though we sympathize with those people.</p>
<p>And in 2008, we&rsquo;ve been in this situation before. 2008, Georgia,</p>
<p>the Republic of Georgia, Putin invaded on behalf of these</p>
<p>breakaway Russian sort of dissident provinces, South Ossetia</p>
<p>and Abkhazia. Why did that happen? Well, if you remember</p>
<p>back in 2008, there was a lot of talk about Georgia joining</p>
<p>NATO. And you had, you know, the Warhawk Senator John McCain</p>
<p>go over there and declare we&rsquo;re all Georgians now. And so what</p>
<p>happened? All of a sudden, these breakaway provinces, the</p>
<p>Russified provinces, South Ossetia and Abkhazia started</p>
<p>rebelling. That gave Putin the excuse to roll in there and the</p>
<p>tanks. A year later, he left, but there was no more talk of</p>
<p>Georgia joining NATO. So and again, we George W. Bush was</p>
<p>president at the time. We did nothing militarily. We just sent</p>
<p>humanitarian assistance. That was it. So we&rsquo;ve been in this</p>
<p>situation before. We should not. I keep hearing in the media</p>
<p>on cable news and on Twitter, this is historically</p>
<p>unprecedented, we must act. No, we&rsquo;ve been in this situation</p>
<p>before in 2008. And all those previous times, we were in this</p>
<p>situation in 2014. When Putin invaded, let me ask you a</p>
<p>question, sir. We had this concept of, hey, maybe if we</p>
<p>said, hey, we won&rsquo;t admit them into NATO. And do you think that</p>
<p>if we had actually made that concession, or said, we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to let them into NATO for a decade, or whatever, do you</p>
<p>think that would have changed Putin&rsquo;s behavior? So now?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s honestly, it&rsquo;s hard to know. I mean, I can&rsquo;t I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>prove a counterfactual. However, I think it was tragic not to</p>
<p>try. I do think I think I think it should be the goal of</p>
<p>diplomats. Sure. To try. And again, as I said on a previous</p>
<p>pod, it was the sleeves off our vest, Ukraine is not gonna be a</p>
<p>member of NATO. So to give that up, would have was basically</p>
<p>giving them nothing. It was almost meaningless to us. And</p>
<p>instead of making that concession, what happened?</p>
<p>Blinken came out with this statement, NATO&rsquo;s door is open</p>
<p>and will remain open. It was perhaps the most provocative</p>
<p>thing he could have said in that situation.</p>
<p>And they would have had to been voted in that would have happened</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have happened anyway. Let me ask you this question.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been complaining about the media and Democrats banging</p>
<p>the drum of war, and you&rsquo;re saying they&rsquo;re more hawkish. On</p>
<p>the other side of the table, you have Trump came out and said</p>
<p>that Putin&rsquo;s move on the Ukraine is genius, and the guy is very</p>
<p>savvy. And then you had Pompeo saying I have enormous respect</p>
<p>for him. And that he&rsquo;s a very talented statesman has lots of</p>
<p>gifts. And he knows how to use power, we should respect that.</p>
<p>So your party, your crew is praising Putin, do you think the</p>
<p>praising of Putin is wise in this kind of situation?</p>
<p>Oh, look, here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on. First of all, the warhawks</p>
<p>and the people being the drums of war is happening on both sides</p>
<p>of the aisle. And on both both both sets of cable news, I was</p>
<p>watching Fox last night. And they were all but you know,</p>
<p>cheerleading for war basically saying we have to go on. I</p>
<p>watched it too. Yeah, it&rsquo;s crazy. We&rsquo;re saying we have to</p>
<p>go on offense that what what is Biden doing saying that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not going to intervene militarily. I&rsquo;m like watching</p>
<p>these people who are acting, you know, it reminded me of Dr.</p>
<p>Strangelove, where you have Slim Pickens, the cowboy riding the</p>
<p>atomic bomb on the way down. They were excited. And I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>watching the cable news. And all these people are acting this</p>
<p>way. And I&rsquo;m like, what in the world is going on? You know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s ratings. It&rsquo;s all this is a big part of what I</p>
<p>tried to point out, our prediction show at the end of</p>
<p>last year, you know, the if a country is happy, if the</p>
<p>economy is growing, if there isn&rsquo;t significant risk of</p>
<p>inflation, no one wants to go to war. When those are not the</p>
<p>case, there&rsquo;s a tendency to say we got to do something. And if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re anxious. And if you don&rsquo;t have anything to</p>
<p>do, and some conflict arises, that&rsquo;s a good place to kind of</p>
<p>apply your energy and your pressure. Let me bring the</p>
<p>dictator himself into this. You&rsquo;ve been silent thus far.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on what we&rsquo;re seeing here? I was letting the</p>
<p>proletariat speak. Okay.</p>
<p>Are you the bourgeoisie? Or what?</p>
<p>That sweater is very bourgeois, I have to say. I mean,</p>
<p>I mean, sweater Karen right now is drafting. She&rsquo;s multiple</p>
<p>emails. She&rsquo;s melting. She&rsquo;s melting. I think there could</p>
<p>just be a GoFundMe to revoke that sweater from you. What is</p>
<p>the story with that sweater? That&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s what Trudeau</p>
<p>Trudeau will revoke in a state of emergency to stop that. Yes.</p>
<p>I mean, this feels like we&rsquo;re processing this chamath so</p>
<p>quickly, that the Ukraine just asked on Twitter today, for</p>
<p>everybody to tell at Russia how they feel about what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing. And the Ukraine I&rsquo;m, this is happening in real time, is</p>
<p>tweeting memes now about Putin. This seems almost surreal, and</p>
<p>is getting very strange in terms of how we&rsquo;re interpreting</p>
<p>it. I mean, is there an off ramp here? Are we just going to</p>
<p>have to deal with Putin doing this every number of years? And</p>
<p>this is just going to be, you know, a year or two of, you</p>
<p>know, conflict? I don&rsquo;t know. But here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s important to</p>
<p>two points. One is the economic sanctions have begun and the</p>
<p>economic damage to Russia has been starting to be infected,</p>
<p>right? I think Germany basically suspended the certification of</p>
<p>Nord Stream 2. That has a huge economic impact to Russia, right?</p>
<p>I think the ruble against the dollar was off nine or 10% this</p>
<p>morning, when I woke up here in Europe, so it&rsquo;s down even more.</p>
<p>So now, the interesting thing about that was that I read an</p>
<p>article in the Wall Street Journal, maybe Nick, you can</p>
<p>dig this up. And this was a few years ago. Preceding this,</p>
<p>Russia had built massive amounts of US dollar reserves. In fact,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been depleted over like the last little crisis that they</p>
<p>went through. And then they had rebuilt all these dollar</p>
<p>reserves. So in some ways, it may have been the case that</p>
<p>these guys have this plan all along. And they put some, you</p>
<p>know, they built up their bank accounts, just in case because</p>
<p>they knew that this would happen. The other thing is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a quote from HR McMaster, he said that</p>
<p>deterrence is a simple equation. It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s the product of will</p>
<p>and capability, right? Will times capabilities. And so, you</p>
<p>know, if you&rsquo;re going to be a deterrent on the world stage</p>
<p>militarily, not only do you have to have an incredible</p>
<p>military capability, you also have to have the will to go to</p>
<p>war is what he said. And I think in America, you know, what</p>
<p>Friedberg said is, I think if you pulled a lot of people, you</p>
<p>know, people are pretty exhausted after all of these</p>
<p>different conflicts. And so I&rsquo;m not sure that the will is there</p>
<p>to go to war. And so the best off ramp is to try to find some</p>
<p>amount of economic pressure points, and then to negotiate</p>
<p>some sort of, you know, release valve from all of that economic</p>
<p>pressure in return for some normalization. I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really the best chance, you know, I can be honest with you,</p>
<p>when I was thinking about the odds of this, just from a</p>
<p>financial perspective, and you know, whether I should be doing</p>
<p>something different or putting something on, I thought that</p>
<p>there was zero chance that this would happen. Literally, I put</p>
<p>it as close to zero as possible, because I thought in 2022, it</p>
<p>just didn&rsquo;t seem like this could be possible. And here we are.</p>
<p>And it seems like it is. I hope everybody reclaims safe.</p>
<p>I think that Biden&rsquo;s going to announce some pretty crippling</p>
<p>sanctions. And I think the West is going to be very punitive</p>
<p>financially. And that&rsquo;s probably awkward. But it depends on it</p>
<p>depends on how long that stuff will last. Because again, like I</p>
<p>said, I think Russia&rsquo;s foreign currency reserves are pretty</p>
<p>strong. Going into this.</p>
<p>Let me let me then pass the ball to you, sax. There&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be a lot of people who are going to die, both Russians</p>
<p>and Ukrainian. Sadly, if this thing keeps escalating, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>190,000 Russian troops on the border, or making their way into</p>
<p>the Ukraine. Is there an off ramp here? In your mind in any</p>
<p>way? Do you think the sanctions will work? And God, these the</p>
<p>poor citizens of Russia? I mean, are they going to crack at some</p>
<p>point? And is this going to blow back on to Putin? Because what</p>
<p>did they seem to get out of this? I guess is a question. Do</p>
<p>the Russian people support this? And will they support it? And</p>
<p>an extended basis?</p>
<p>Well, okay. So there&rsquo;s a few questions there. Okay, so the</p>
<p>fact of the matter is so so I think you&rsquo;re right that Putin</p>
<p>has bought himself a headache here, right? I mean, the the</p>
<p>eastern parts of Ukraine that are, you know, ethnically</p>
<p>Russian, the areas of the Donbass, they will, those people</p>
<p>will support him. But the western part of Ukraine that</p>
<p>wants to be free, that&rsquo;s not ethnically Russian, that is</p>
<p>going to be a headache for him to manage. I don&rsquo;t think he</p>
<p>wants this problem long term, it&rsquo;s probably going to be more</p>
<p>like the situation we had in Georgia in 2008. He goes in for</p>
<p>a year, he institutes perhaps some sort of puppet government</p>
<p>or some government that&rsquo;s more favorable to him. And then he</p>
<p>gets out probably this is if there&rsquo;s no escalation. I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very important. I keep making this point. The most</p>
<p>important thing Biden can do is to make sure that this does not</p>
<p>escalate militarily and that we do not get militarily involved.</p>
<p>I think sanctions will happen. I mean, that&rsquo;s pretty clear.</p>
<p>Probably, we have to move forward with that. But But at</p>
<p>the same time, it will sanctions work in terms of being a strong</p>
<p>deterrent. No, I don&rsquo;t think so. There was a very good article</p>
<p>by Neil Ferguson and Ken Griffin, actually in the Wall</p>
<p>Street Journal talking about what we should do. They made the</p>
<p>point that sanctions don&rsquo;t usually work. However, what we</p>
<p>should really be striving for is energy independence. So 100%</p>
<p>So yes, but the crazy thing is America, despite having these</p>
<p>huge natural gas reserves, 7% of our natural gas is coming from</p>
<p>Russia right now. So why because we stopped fracking, we stopped</p>
<p>the you know, Biden cancel the Keystone pipeline. And then in</p>
<p>Europe, the situation is even worse, which is they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>completely dependent on on Russian natural gas.</p>
<p>Germans are in the UK, not France.</p>
<p>The op ed made the point that we could be investing in liquefying</p>
<p>natural gas and exporting it to Europe to create more energy</p>
<p>independence and that would remove their dependency on</p>
<p>Putin that energy independence here.</p>
<p>Problem with energy independence is it takes too long. And we</p>
<p>went through a massive capital under investment cycle over the</p>
<p>last six or seven years. And so you know, in order to start</p>
<p>this off, you need to have started actually putting money</p>
<p>in the ground six or seven years. And the problem today is</p>
<p>if we put money into the ground now, that&rsquo;s not going to yield</p>
<p>any sort of return on investment capital for another six or seven</p>
<p>years. And so when you look at these nat gas companies, every</p>
<p>single one to a name has basically said we are not going</p>
<p>to put any incremental capital into us domestic net gas or</p>
<p>shale, or even offshore. The real solution is to actually go</p>
<p>fully alternative and to go to renewable energy. Because you</p>
<p>can today, right? deploy solar vastly more aggressively in the</p>
<p>United States. Look, at the end of the day, the thing that is</p>
<p>completely abundant and has the best implications all around is</p>
<p>solar</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gotten cheaper than coal and and and and stuff like</p>
<p>why why are we only 3% penetrated in the United States?</p>
<p>Right? We can manufacture these panels, we can deploy them</p>
<p>broadly. Right now, you know, we&rsquo;re in this situation where</p>
<p>California is actually revisiting the ITC credit or the</p>
<p>net metering laws, sorry, rather, which would have huge</p>
<p>implications for the California solar market, it could actually</p>
<p>destroy that whole market. And so you know, we have to get</p>
<p>really organized, David, to your point, but there is a path to</p>
<p>energy independence, I think it&rsquo;s alternative energy, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wind and solar. Because we can do it today. And you can do it</p>
<p>really quickly. And you can basically leapfrog the entire</p>
<p>capital investment cycle that you need to do for net gas, we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve already missed the train.</p>
<p>Well, and also you could have Germany could start turning back</p>
<p>on nuclear power plants if they could get their citizens to pick</p>
<p>nuclear over war. And that seems like a pretty easy choice.</p>
<p>It takes too long.</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;ve been doing it for 20 years. They&rsquo;ve been turning</p>
<p>them off for 20 years.</p>
<p>I know they could. That means they don&rsquo;t have to rebuild them</p>
<p>tomorrow. They could just turn the back on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a light switch, Jason. No, but that&rsquo;s not how it works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a light switch.</p>
<p>I know, but it&rsquo;s not the same as building a new one in the US.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the point. They could build them back on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still years. It&rsquo;s still years between these things.</p>
<p>But the threat of doing it, but you got to think Chamath, the</p>
<p>threat of doing it would terrorize the Saudis and the</p>
<p>Russians if all of a sudden the EU said we are going to go</p>
<p>massive solar, massive nuclear, and we&rsquo;re going to be energy</p>
<p>independent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure any country is going to really have a massive</p>
<p>reaction to any other country talking about a multi year</p>
<p>investment cycle.</p>
<p>I do think Jason, to your point, solar is not a multi year</p>
<p>investment cycle. It can literally happen in bucks.</p>
<p>Yes, and it&rsquo;s much more disruptive.</p>
<p>So for example, if you took $3 trillion to build back better</p>
<p>and instead said, you know what, we&rsquo;re just gonna actually put</p>
<p>solar everywhere, everywhere, that would be you take $3</p>
<p>trillion of solar, and you put it literally everywhere in the</p>
<p>United States, I think everybody would support it, you would</p>
<p>have domestic job creation, like nobody&rsquo;s business, you would</p>
<p>take so much carbon out of the air, and you don&rsquo;t need to work</p>
<p>enormous energy dependence.</p>
<p>Well, it would give you a degree of freedom so that the next</p>
<p>time you&rsquo;re pushed to war, you can actually evaluate it under</p>
<p>a very different, you know, risk calculus than if you actually</p>
<p>need the energy from the country.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>And just for a fact check here, nuclear power in Germany</p>
<p>accounted for 13.3% of German electrical supply in 2021.</p>
<p>France, by the way, 70 80%.</p>
<p>And that was generated by six power plant, of which three were</p>
<p>switched off.</p>
<p>At the end of 2021.</p>
<p>They literally just turned these off Chamath.</p>
<p>And the other three, I know, but the decision was not made</p>
<p>yesterday, Jason, my point is, this is these are 20 year</p>
<p>decision.</p>
<p>Now it was Fukushima that pushed them actually in the sentiment</p>
<p>of, and they also had 70% of their electricity on a couple of</p>
<p>weeks come from renewable.</p>
<p>So the Germans suddenly thought that they didn&rsquo;t live in a</p>
<p>shady area and they could get by with just solar, which is a</p>
<p>big mistake.</p>
<p>This turning these off Germany, if they didn&rsquo;t turn these off,</p>
<p>they would have a different approach here too.</p>
<p>You can be sure of that.</p>
<p>So, look, I&rsquo;m a fan of solar, but I&rsquo;ll just make the point</p>
<p>that natural gas burns from a climate standpoint, it burns</p>
<p>much cleaner than oil and oil burns much clearer than coal.</p>
<p>So natural gas is a way better than a lot of the alternatives.</p>
<p>And the main problem with it is that when you frack, you can</p>
<p>get the release of water.</p>
<p>Well, that but that&rsquo;s in the ground.</p>
<p>But in terms of the release of methane, which is a greenhouse</p>
<p>gas, that&rsquo;s actually worse than CO2.</p>
<p>And so you can actually get, you know, methane release.</p>
<p>But in the US, we have techniques for recapture of it.</p>
<p>Whereas I don&rsquo;t think Russia cares about that.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;d be a lot better off.</p>
<p>I think solar is part of the answer, but I don&rsquo;t think we</p>
<p>should be turning our backs on the enormous reserves of</p>
<p>natural gas that we have here in this country.</p>
<p>Friedberg, what are your thoughts?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re hearing three of us talk about energy, give us your</p>
<p>science boy superpowers here.</p>
<p>And what do you think is the clearest shot on goal here for</p>
<p>energy independence as an option to war?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just point out that the notion that there are countries</p>
<p>that are jockeying or positioning to stop the train</p>
<p>towards renewable alternatives for energy production this</p>
<p>century, the number of countries in that bucket are close to</p>
<p>zero.</p>
<p>You know, Saudi Arabia took Saudi Aramco public specifically</p>
<p>so that they under kind of MBS&rsquo;s strategic direction, diversify</p>
<p>away from, you know, the fossil fuel dependency of their</p>
<p>economy and diversify into other assets.</p>
<p>So they are going to sell down their equity interest in Saudi</p>
<p>Aramco over time, and invest in things, you know, they probably</p>
<p>made their first bet and regret it with SoftBank.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;ll probably make other bets to try and invest in kind</p>
<p>of next gen industries.</p>
<p>And so, you know, if you look at the money that&rsquo;s going from</p>
<p>even Exxon, and you know, there&rsquo;s a guy locally here in</p>
<p>San Francisco, who ran a very significant board proxy fight to</p>
<p>get on the board of Exxon, and he won, and he&rsquo;s jockeying for</p>
<p>continued and increased investment from an R&amp;D</p>
<p>perspective in renewables and alternatives.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re seeing this across the board, there&rsquo;s going to be in</p>
<p>the next couple years, if not already, many of these fossil</p>
<p>fuel dependent businesses, and countries have or are making a</p>
<p>massive shift towards alternative renewable sources of</p>
<p>energy.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think that there&rsquo;s any enemy here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no evil, like all the folks that have been dependent</p>
<p>on in the past are aware of the fact that this is not where the</p>
<p>future is, we do have to transition.</p>
<p>So the reason I bought energy stocks in December, and the</p>
<p>reason I made this point was threefold.</p>
<p>One is because we have, as a result of this general consensus</p>
<p>view, under invested in energy infrastructure.</p>
<p>And the demands that are going to come out of the ex COVID</p>
<p>economic growth cycle cannot be met with the current energy</p>
<p>infrastructure, and you&rsquo;re going to see energy prices continue</p>
<p>to climb, coupled with the fact that when war or conflict</p>
<p>arises, typically, you see stockpiling, and you see trade</p>
<p>routes being shut down, and you see energy prices climb.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I think generally, we&rsquo;re in a little bit</p>
<p>of a transitionary state, everyone knows where the puck</p>
<p>needs to be, everyone&rsquo;s headed there.</p>
<p>But for now, I think everyone&rsquo;s trying to navigate, how do we</p>
<p>get through the next couple of years?</p>
<p>And in this particular year, you know, get through the season</p>
<p>of uncertainty.</p>
<p>You know, how fast is the economy growing?</p>
<p>How much have we actually under invested in infrastructure?</p>
<p>And how much renewables do we have coming online?</p>
<p>Now, I think the right answer, if I were to be president of the</p>
<p>world, I would immediately deregulate nuclear and make</p>
<p>nuclear fission reactors, a mainstay of energy production</p>
<p>here in the US.</p>
<p>And I think that there are a number of techniques we could</p>
<p>undertake for a safer</p>
<p>building without all the regulatory cycles and process</p>
<p>needed to get these things stood up.</p>
<p>You know, China, as I&rsquo;ve mentioned in the past, is over</p>
<p>the next 30 years committed to building check this number out,</p>
<p>I think we talked about this 140 nuclear power stations,</p>
<p>their estimated cost, I believe is on the $3 billion per station</p>
<p>range, they are going to increase their total energy</p>
<p>production capacity with these nuclear power stations on the</p>
<p>order of 15 to 20%.</p>
<p>So they will take coal offline as they bring those online, or</p>
<p>they will kind of start to have a cleaner mix of energy rather</p>
<p>than building an extra infrastructure.</p>
<p>So, you know, if we as the United States intend to be an</p>
<p>economic challenge to China this century, if we intend to</p>
<p>compete effectively with them, we are going to have a really</p>
<p>hard time with energy prices being what they are here in this</p>
<p>country, China is already 30 to 40% cheaper than us on an</p>
<p>industrial scale basis with their current energy</p>
<p>infrastructure.</p>
<p>And when their nuclear comes online over the next decade,</p>
<p>their prices are going to drop even further nuclear should be</p>
<p>in the four to 5% per kilowatt hour range.</p>
<p>Today, China&rsquo;s in the kind of, you know, seven to 8% per</p>
<p>kilowatt hour range, the US for industrial, I think is in kind</p>
<p>of a 9% 10% range, eight to 10% depending on where you look.</p>
<p>So, you know, they&rsquo;re already cheaper, they&rsquo;re going to get</p>
<p>even cheaper.</p>
<p>And so not just from like, what&rsquo;s the right transition from</p>
<p>a security point of view, but energy is going to be so</p>
<p>critical in this next century, for us to maintain our footing</p>
<p>as a competitor to China, particularly as big about</p>
<p>this for a second.</p>
<p>If automation is the future of manufacturing, then electricity</p>
<p>and energy ends up being the biggest cost driver for those</p>
<p>systems.</p>
<p>And if our if everything is on parity, and everyone&rsquo;s got the</p>
<p>same automation systems, whoever&rsquo;s got the cheaper energy</p>
<p>wins.</p>
<p>And to dovetail you and Chamath&rsquo;s both positions, a</p>
<p>friend of ours said, Hey, you know, nobody wants to live near</p>
<p>nuclear power plants.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve already got the grid going there, because it has to</p>
<p>be there surround the nuclear power plant with a solar farm,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the most efficient way.</p>
<p>So actually pairing these two things, perhaps even with some</p>
<p>batteries, solves the entire problem.</p>
<p>And what do we think sacks is the eventuality here, in terms</p>
<p>of the relationship between Russia and China, now that we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>wrapped up the energy, and then, you know, all of us, I think</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to go to war here.</p>
<p>So I guess there&rsquo;s two questions here of escalation.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll let you pick which one you want to go for escalation</p>
<p>with Taiwan, or does, if Putin is not held, we don&rsquo;t hold the</p>
<p>line here.</p>
<p>You know, Putin picks another country to or another region to</p>
<p>go after in 2023 2024.</p>
<p>At what point do you say we got to hold the line?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I think the line is that we have existing NATO</p>
<p>treaty obligations to protect the members of NATO under Article</p>
<p>five, we have to come to their defense, Ukraine is not one</p>
<p>Georgia is not one.</p>
<p>So to me, that&rsquo;s the line is our existing treaty obligations.</p>
<p>And this is why we should not want to add some of these</p>
<p>countries to NATO is because it involves us in their disputes</p>
<p>and drags us into war.</p>
<p>You know, on Twitter, all I hear is that this is 1938 all over</p>
<p>again, and we cannot appease a dictator.</p>
<p>And that is one lesson of history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an important lesson.</p>
<p>However, there are other lessons of history.</p>
<p>And it seems to me that the situation we&rsquo;re in could be more</p>
<p>like 1914, which is World War One, what happened in World War</p>
<p>One, basically conflicts between minor powers drag major</p>
<p>powers into wars.</p>
<p>And basically, Germany gave Austria the so called blank check</p>
<p>war guarantee.</p>
<p>And then that led to a war with Russia.</p>
<p>And then that dragged the, you know, Britain and France in and</p>
<p>eventually the United States.</p>
<p>So, you know, it was a case where nobody, none of these</p>
<p>powers wanted to be in a war with each other.</p>
<p>And yet, somehow inertia, and threats and escalations, and</p>
<p>miscalculations and folly, all sort of tumbled their way into</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And that I think may be the historical precedent here that</p>
<p>we want to avoid.</p>
<p>I think we need to be very careful not to let, you know,</p>
<p>every conflict all over the world drag us into these, these</p>
<p>types of wars and disputes.</p>
<p>Saks, do you think American primacy is coming to an end?</p>
<p>I hope not.</p>
<p>But if our goal is to preserve American primacy, which I think</p>
<p>it should be, then we need to be smart about how we use our</p>
<p>strength.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t want to fritter it away.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;ve been doing for the last 20 years frittering away</p>
<p>our strength in wars we didn&rsquo;t need to be in, in the Middle</p>
<p>East, we spent how many trillions on nation building</p>
<p>there, that turned out to be a total folly and waste of money.</p>
<p>Look at this, and we have a $30 trillion national debt.</p>
<p>If we want this century to be an American century, like the</p>
<p>last one, we need to preserve our strength and use it wisely</p>
<p>and not involve ourselves in every conflict.</p>
<p>And, you know, so look, we need to protect our NATO allies.</p>
<p>I agree with that.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t need to be creating disputes and involving</p>
<p>ourselves in wars that we have no obligation to get involved</p>
<p>in.</p>
<p>We need energy independence, and we need to deliver our</p>
<p>balance sheet for American finances.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s possible, but it&rsquo;s going to require a lot of</p>
<p>focus and sacrifice.</p>
<p>I really think the scene that I just made up that is actually</p>
<p>really quite genius, which is redirect that $3 trillion build</p>
<p>that better build to just pure solar everywhere in the United</p>
<p>States.</p>
<p>It would be so disruptive.</p>
<p>I mean, it would just be so disruptive.</p>
<p>It becomes a dividend.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s UBI in a way.</p>
<p>Everybody gets no electrical bill.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it would allow people to have free electricity</p>
<p>forever.</p>
<p>But I do think it would subsidize basically the deployment</p>
<p>of energy infrastructure to every single household in</p>
<p>America in a way that would just completely shake up,</p>
<p>frankly, the political world order.</p>
<p>Because what you guys said is so true.</p>
<p>A lot of this stuff rests on the politics around natural</p>
<p>resources, right?</p>
<p>So today, it&rsquo;s oil.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, it&rsquo;s going to be some rare earth.</p>
<p>In 10 years, it could be copper and lithium.</p>
<p>And we want to find ourselves with the ability to be clear,</p>
<p>tied, and focused in our response to these issues.</p>
<p>But if we need critical resources that can only come from</p>
<p>one other place or two other places, and we don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>engineering ingenuity to have figured out how to de-lever our</p>
<p>reliance, then we&rsquo;re going to get dragged into not just this</p>
<p>conflict, but a whole bunch of other conflicts going forward.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say yes.</p>
<p>And we could be energy independent for free right now</p>
<p>if we were just to repeal some of these executive orders.</p>
<p>I mean, we were energy independent like a year or two</p>
<p>ago until we banned fracking.</p>
<p>Why do the fracking when solar is available?</p>
<p>It seems to me like we want to actually preserve the</p>
<p>environment, stop global warming.</p>
<p>So if solar is available and nuclear is available, why would</p>
<p>you advocate for fracking and ripping up the earth and</p>
<p>polluting it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a fan of solar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really just about costs and time to deployment.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>OK, so you see it as a bridge.</p>
<p>Hey, maybe we do it for five years, 10 years.</p>
<p>Long term, I think solar is the answer.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s a long term strategy.</p>
<p>The other thing that is confounding is like Americans,</p>
<p>and this is another thing I was just watching the media,</p>
<p>and I did exactly what you did, David.</p>
<p>As I put on Fox, I was like, let me get their interpretation</p>
<p>of this, because the Trump folks are praising Putin.</p>
<p>And then these guys are wanting to go to war.</p>
<p>So it feels like there&rsquo;s some inner conflict or civil war</p>
<p>going on in the Republican side of things.</p>
<p>But even on the.</p>
<p>There is.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then on the left, you have this craziness.</p>
<p>They were, I mean, Wolf Blitzer and everybody was so excited</p>
<p>about this war.</p>
<p>They were like, stay tuned.</p>
<p>And oh, my God, we&rsquo;re going to be 24 hour coverage.</p>
<p>They were like orgasmic in their coverage.</p>
<p>Remember, CNN got their got their big.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Golf War at the Gulf War.</p>
<p>That was it.</p>
<p>Well, that was the chance to shine.</p>
<p>I remember being a kid watching that.</p>
<p>That is the language.</p>
<p>Free break.</p>
<p>That was the language they were using.</p>
<p>So Don Lemon was saying.</p>
<p>And we have the full resources to give you blow by blow coverage</p>
<p>of everything happening.</p>
<p>Stick with CNN.</p>
<p>This is where we do our best work.</p>
<p>And it was literally like war porn.</p>
<p>And it was really uncomfortable to watch combined with sacks.</p>
<p>And this is what I wanted.</p>
<p>Well, maybe freeberg, I&rsquo;ll throw this one to you.</p>
<p>They kept talking about how Americans were going to suffer</p>
<p>at the pump.</p>
<p>And I just thought this is so crazy and disturbing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 190,000 young Russian men who are going to die.</p>
<p>Countless Ukrainian civil civilians who are going to die</p>
<p>potentially.</p>
<p>And this thing could escalate.</p>
<p>A sack said, you know, you can&rsquo;t play games with war.</p>
<p>He could.</p>
<p>The dominoes can fall in all directions.</p>
<p>You have no idea when you light off these grenades.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re talking about our pain at the pump.</p>
<p>Very weird.</p>
<p>Very weird times.</p>
<p>Freeberg, any thoughts?</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>I want to if freeberg doesn&rsquo;t want to respond to that.</p>
<p>I want to I want to talk about the media coverage.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll add to that.</p>
<p>I mean, you flip over to MSNBC.</p>
<p>John Bolton is on MSNBC.</p>
<p>And one of the weirdest things happening in our politics now</p>
<p>is that all the neocons who used to be members of the Republican</p>
<p>Party who worked for George W. Bush and got us into the Iraq</p>
<p>war have now all become Democrats.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re all over.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re supposedly the conscience of the country over on CNN and</p>
<p>MSNBC and beating the drums of war.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely unbelievable.</p>
<p>And one of the tactics they use that I think we should talk about</p>
<p>is, and this goes all the way back to the Vietnam War, is that</p>
<p>anybody who merely tries to, let&rsquo;s say, understand the other</p>
<p>side or wants to deescalate or get out of a conflict, they try</p>
<p>to portray as unpatriotic.</p>
<p>I mean, again, this goes all the way back to the Vietnam War,</p>
<p>where the Vietnam protesters were portrayed as un-American</p>
<p>and unpatriotic.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out they were right.</p>
<p>That was a mistake for us to get embroiled in Vietnam.</p>
<p>And similarly, the Iraq War, it turns out that was a gigantic</p>
<p>mistake.</p>
<p>But in 2003, David Frum, who&rsquo;s like one of the leaders of this</p>
<p>group, wrote an article called Unpatriotic Conservatives, in</p>
<p>which he attacked and sort of mow-mowed the&hellip;</p>
<p>There were conservatives like Pat Buchanan and Robert Novak</p>
<p>who were against the Iraq War, and he called them</p>
<p>unpatriotic and implied that they were un-American, and</p>
<p>somehow in the pocket of Saddam Hussein, because they were</p>
<p>against us, our involvement in the Iraq War.</p>
<p>Well, they turned out to be right, and yet they were</p>
<p>demonized and called unpatriotic.</p>
<p>And where are we today?</p>
<p>Those same people I&rsquo;m seeing, David Frum, on Twitter now,</p>
<p>impugn the patriotism of people who merely want us not to</p>
<p>escalate this, not to get involved, and maybe to try and</p>
<p>understand our enemy.</p>
<p>Because, I mean, this is one of the problems with Twitterizing</p>
<p>our foreign policy is, look, we can see Putin as an aggressor,</p>
<p>we can see him as a thug or an authoritarian or as a dictator,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, we should still try and understand our</p>
<p>enemy.</p>
<p>And anybody who tries to promote a greater degree of</p>
<p>understanding or diplomacy gets attacked by these people as</p>
<p>being Putin apologists.</p>
<p>Chamath, you said you didn&rsquo;t see this coming, you thought</p>
<p>this was a very small probability.</p>
<p>I think we all felt it was a pretty small probability that</p>
<p>Russia would actually go through with this.</p>
<p>You thought it was actually something?</p>
<p>Actually, I do.</p>
<p>Friedberg, you did think it was going to happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a certainty.</p>
<p>Yeah, wait, you thought it was a certainty that America would</p>
<p>get involved because of the wag the dog scenario?</p>
<p>Or that Putin would do it because?</p>
<p>Both.</p>
<p>This is not like a surprise that Putin did this.</p>
<p>I mean, this has been a long time coming.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it just felt like I thought that he would</p>
<p>saber rattle and we come to some resolution here.</p>
<p>But what does he want?</p>
<p>It seems like nobody, and this is what everybody keeps saying</p>
<p>By the way, I think that&rsquo;s a really complicated question.</p>
<p>I feel like there&rsquo;s decades of and layers of like, to the</p>
<p>story, it&rsquo;s like, you know, war and peace, and then you read</p>
<p>like one half of the final chapter, and you&rsquo;re like, Oh,</p>
<p>yeah, okay.</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s a lot to the story that&rsquo;s going to be really</p>
<p>hard for us to unpack.</p>
<p>So, you know, I&rsquo;m not sure there&rsquo;s a very simple, like,</p>
<p>what does Putin want as much as there is a significant</p>
<p>narrative that backs the history, you know, post Soviet</p>
<p>history with Ukraine and the relationships.</p>
<p>I mean, you guys may remember that there was a president,</p>
<p>a presidential candidate or president that was poisoned by</p>
<p>Putin at some point.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s been like a long history to this that I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think is something that we can reunification is what most</p>
<p>people would put that under is there&rsquo;s economic, there are</p>
<p>social, you know, there are individuals, cultural motives.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot driving this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of influence within that country that I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think we really fully grasp within the country of Russia.</p>
<p>I mean, that we don&rsquo;t fully grasp related to some of the</p>
<p>cultural relationships with some of the population in either</p>
<p>group in the Ukraine.</p>
<p>And so, you know, it&rsquo;s a very difficult question to simply</p>
<p>answer.</p>
<p>Can I take a shot at it?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>Okay, what does Putin want?</p>
<p>So I want to there&rsquo;s an article by Peter Baynard, who was an</p>
<p>editor of the New Republic, he&rsquo;s not, you know, some far right</p>
<p>conservative or whatever.</p>
<p>He published this quotes from a memo that was written by Bill</p>
<p>Burns, back in 2008.</p>
<p>So Bill Burns is the current DC is the Director of Central</p>
<p>Intelligence, the head of the CIA.</p>
<p>He is also a Russian expert.</p>
<p>He speaks Russian fluently.</p>
<p>He is the and he spent many years over there in our</p>
<p>government, and he works for Biden, he&rsquo;s Biden&rsquo;s head of the</p>
<p>CIA.</p>
<p>So he is the highest ranking Russian expert in our</p>
<p>government.</p>
<p>In 2008, he wrote a memo to Condoleezza Rice, who was then</p>
<p>the Secretary of State.</p>
<p>And what he said is, this is about Ukrainian entry into</p>
<p>NATO.</p>
<p>He said, Ukrainian entry into NATO is the brightest of all</p>
<p>red lines for the Russian elite, not just Putin.</p>
<p>He says, in more than two and a half years of conversations</p>
<p>with key Russian players from knuckle draggers in the dark</p>
<p>recesses of the Kremlin, to Putin&rsquo;s sharpest liberal</p>
<p>critics, I have yet to find anyone who views Ukraine and</p>
<p>NATO as anything other than a direct challenge to Russian</p>
<p>interests.</p>
<p>So Burns pointed out to the then Secretary of State that this</p>
<p>was a huge red line.</p>
<p>And since then, since 2008, Putin has been very consistent</p>
<p>that Ukrainian entry into NATO has been a red line.</p>
<p>And even in the speech that he gave last week, he talked</p>
<p>about, he talked about this.</p>
<p>And he said that, I&rsquo;m quoting Putin from his speech, he says,</p>
<p>if Ukraine was to join NATO, it would serve as a direct</p>
<p>threat to the security of Russia.</p>
<p>So, you know, in response to Putin&rsquo;s speech, and on Twitter,</p>
<p>I keep hearing that Putin is this madman, we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand what he wants, that the only possible explanation</p>
<p>for his behavior is either senility, he&rsquo;s gone crazy, he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gone mad.</p>
<p>And, you know, I&rsquo;m looking at this, and I&rsquo;m like, okay, maybe</p>
<p>those things are true.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t say that he hasn&rsquo;t been clear about what his</p>
<p>red lines are.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been saying this for 20 years, that Ukraine joining the</p>
<p>NATO alliance is an absolute red line.</p>
<p>And, you know, I mentioned before on this pod that imagine</p>
<p>if the Cold War is still going on, and the Warsaw Pact still</p>
<p>existed.</p>
<p>And, you know, Justin Trudeau was going to lead Canada into</p>
<p>the Warsaw Pact, we would absolutely be up in arms about</p>
<p>that, we would not let that happen.</p>
<p>It is that kind of issue for Putin.</p>
<p>And we just act like this guy is insane, and has no point of</p>
<p>view.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, we don&rsquo;t have to believe he&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But to basically say that he has no interest in Russian</p>
<p>security, that we need to give any weight to that we just need</p>
<p>to dismiss all of his concerns out of hand.</p>
<p>It just, you know, this is not the history of the situation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Did you read anybody read Madeleine Albright&rsquo;s New York</p>
<p>Times piece?</p>
<p>It was pretty interesting, because she was in the position</p>
<p>when they first met him.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s been talking about the Ukraine and reunification for</p>
<p>20 years.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably a good lesson for the entire planet, that</p>
<p>dictators are going to, you know, they have a certain to</p>
<p>your point, Chamath, of like, having will and capabilities.</p>
<p>A lot of people have capabilities.</p>
<p>A lot of people don&rsquo;t have will to start wars anymore on this</p>
<p>planet.</p>
<p>And, and he clearly is in that group, I think, as hard as it</p>
<p>is.</p>
<p>But Jason, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing, by not taking NATO off the table as an issue,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know whether his true aim here is the restoration of</p>
<p>the Russian Empire, or merely to avoid, you know, this border</p>
<p>country being part of a military alliance that he views as a</p>
<p>threat.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know what the answer is.</p>
<p>Or door number three, he wants more attention, he wants to be</p>
<p>more globally relevant.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But we made the mistake of not taking this issue off the table.</p>
<p>And so if we had taken the issue off the table, then we could</p>
<p>get to the real heart of the issue.</p>
<p>Maybe it would have diffused the situation.</p>
<p>Or if the EU and NATO had done it, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just us in this.</p>
<p>The people in Europe have a big say here, as we&rsquo;re discussing</p>
<p>this on a on a Thursday, February 24.</p>
<p>Biden has announced a coalition of partners, EU, Australia,</p>
<p>others are doing pretty significant sanctions, it seems,</p>
<p>limiting Russia&rsquo;s ability to do business in dollars, euros and</p>
<p>yen imposing major sanctions on the Russian banks trying to</p>
<p>cripple the ruble blocking form.</p>
<p>Major Russian banks freezing all of their assets in America,</p>
<p>adding sanctions to Russian elites, I guess that&rsquo;s the oligarch</p>
<p>class. And Russia&rsquo;s largest state on enterprises will no</p>
<p>longer be able to raise money from coalition of governments</p>
<p>Biden assumes this will degrade their military advancement.</p>
<p>And I have a funny Russian story to tell.</p>
<p>So when I was when I was still running, when I was managing,</p>
<p>not just my money, but other people&rsquo;s money, and I was</p>
<p>raising funds, eventually, you know, you, you get LP</p>
<p>commitments from all kinds of people interested in investing</p>
<p>with you, if you&rsquo;re generating great returns, right?</p>
<p>Meaning, you know, rich family offices all around the world</p>
<p>want to give you capital.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a very strict process in America, where when</p>
<p>you get capital in, you have to make sure that those folks</p>
<p>basically pass, you know, an anti money laundering check and</p>
<p>a know your customer kind of check.</p>
<p>KYC checks.</p>
<p>And one of these checks is actually a gray list and a black</p>
<p>list that Treasury and the DOJ kind of manage.</p>
<p>And every now and then they&rsquo;ll put people on and off the list.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a very famous person in Russia, who I will not say</p>
<p>when I was raising money for my last fund, this is probably in</p>
<p>2014 or 15.</p>
<p>He was on the he was not on the list.</p>
<p>You know, very well.</p>
<p>And I thought, wow, this is a great opportunity to get</p>
<p>somebody who seems to be doing a lot of really interesting good</p>
<p>work.</p>
<p>And not less than two or three weeks after we had signed our</p>
<p>LP agreement, I think it was DOJ or Treasury, put them on this</p>
<p>list.</p>
<p>And we get a we get a, you know, an email basically saying, a</p>
<p>tear up the LPA, and you can&rsquo;t take the capital.</p>
<p>And we had to undo the entire limited partner agreement.</p>
<p>Crazy.</p>
<p>What percentage of the fund would that person have been</p>
<p>ballpark?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>But he was a he&rsquo;s a significant person investing significant</p>
<p>510% or something.</p>
<p>So I would guess.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, Jason, I just want to going back on a point I made about</p>
<p>energy and energy independence earlier, because I actually</p>
<p>pulled up the numbers.</p>
<p>So, you know, the average cost per kilowatt hour in the in</p>
<p>China right now is about nine cents.</p>
<p>For for energy production, it is estimated that nuclear power</p>
<p>production should drop to about four cents, but could be as low</p>
<p>as one cent per kilowatt hour if operated at scale, with perfect</p>
<p>efficiency, just to give everyone a sense of where not just</p>
<p>security risk and kind of, you know, the green opportunity lies,</p>
<p>but also where economic advantage lies in investing in nuclear</p>
<p>infrastructure.</p>
<p>And so as China builds out 140 nuclear plants here over the next</p>
<p>two to three decades, they&rsquo;re going to see their energy costs</p>
<p>decline from about nine cents for industrial use, potentially,</p>
<p>you know, into the sub five cent per kilowatt hour range, which</p>
<p>makes them tremendously competitive on a manufacturing</p>
<p>point of view.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of Bitcoin servers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of hash.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s never going to happen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>I love nuclear.</p>
<p>I think America America&rsquo;s America&rsquo;s ability to scale nuclear, I</p>
<p>think is a very difficult proposition.</p>
<p>And I think our real solution is solar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s solar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s practical.</p>
<p>It can be done today.</p>
<p>And it can be done right now.</p>
<p>And just to look at the EU versus the US in terms of gas mileage,</p>
<p>which is just stunning.</p>
<p>The EU has mandated America doesn&rsquo;t have the resolve.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s like, we have to we have to cross so many</p>
<p>bridges.</p>
<p>And, you know, we have to really confront a bunch of issues that</p>
<p>we that have been riddled with so much inaccuracy, you know,</p>
<p>for example, the environmental impact, the understanding of</p>
<p>how nuclear energy works, you know, the NIMBY is in Jason that</p>
<p>you referred to about not being able to build these things all</p>
<p>around the country.</p>
<p>And so reducing the form factor, in my opinion, is a technical</p>
<p>challenge that I think we can overcome.</p>
<p>But it still leaves the policy and the societal level challenges</p>
<p>that I think are very difficult to overcome.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re talking about rewriting history in many ways</p>
<p>and, and convincing, you know, hundreds of millions of people</p>
<p>that things that they had thought were true are no longer</p>
<p>true.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s much, much harder than we give it credit</p>
<p>for.</p>
<p>And cars is a perfect example.</p>
<p>Americans now we&rsquo;re averaging 24 miles to the gallon, the EU is</p>
<p>mandated 57 miles per gallon in 2021.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re getting it done in the EU.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re twice as effective.</p>
<p>I tweeted, Hey, listen, Americans, we need to buy better</p>
<p>gas mileage cars and move to EVs.</p>
<p>And I was faced with quite a backlash.</p>
<p>I mean, it was insane.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not entirely true, because California did pass their</p>
<p>own legislation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And there was this issue because the car companies pushed back</p>
<p>and said, you know, it&rsquo;s too expensive for us to build two</p>
<p>different SKUs, one for California and one for the rest</p>
<p>of America.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re already building ones for the EU.</p>
<p>Just to give you one counterpoint to your statement</p>
<p>about energy independence arising potentially from solar</p>
<p>to generate a gigawatt of capacity and industrial scale</p>
<p>solar farm would take about 7500 acres.</p>
<p>You know, so that&rsquo;s about 30.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>done.</p>
<p>I think a very simple solar installation and everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>home with a simple battery is more than enough to basically</p>
<p>give people the power they need.</p>
<p>And then these big CNI installations that&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>on top of all these big buildings will cover the rest.</p>
<p>And I think that you&rsquo;ll still have some amount of nat gas</p>
<p>beakers usage, and maybe you can have some amount of solar</p>
<p>or hydro or wind.</p>
<p>But people are experimenting and figuring out the battery</p>
<p>storage capability to supplement this.</p>
<p>I think what we don&rsquo;t have is that at 3% resi solar, we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a credible alternative.</p>
<p>But you know, 80% resi solar with battery systems in</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s home, which is a tractable solution that costs</p>
<p>thousands of dollars per home, which the government could</p>
<p>subsidize would be a great use of capital, I think would be</p>
<p>transformational for energy, it would completely rewrite the</p>
<p>energy calculus.</p>
<p>So again, to do that today would cost because when you do</p>
<p>something on a residential roof, it costs a lot more than doing</p>
<p>it on an industrial scale.</p>
<p>So when you build out a 7500 acre solar facility, you get</p>
<p>economies of scale, you get single tubes, everything can run</p>
<p>off one wire, when you build it on a roof, you need contractors</p>
<p>to come in, you got to wire the home, you got to put batteries</p>
<p>in.</p>
<p>So the actual amortized cost over the lifetime of that solar</p>
<p>installation works out to something on the order of 15</p>
<p>cents a kilowatt hour.</p>
<p>Whereas if you do it on an industrial scale, it works out</p>
<p>to about three cents a kilowatt hour.</p>
<p>So you know, your point makes sense, but it makes things more</p>
<p>expensive.</p>
<p>So then the question is, who&rsquo;s going to fund the delta?</p>
<p>And is someone actually going to pay for that delta?</p>
<p>The government.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re gonna we&rsquo;re gonna I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m sure over the next</p>
<p>few years, we&rsquo;re going to spend trillions and trillions of</p>
<p>dollars on nothing.</p>
<p>Those trillions and trillions of dollars could probably whatever</p>
<p>your gap is, I don&rsquo;t know whether your math is right or</p>
<p>wrong.</p>
<p>But whatever the gap is, that gets us to China as an example,</p>
<p>in terms of the cost per kilowatt hour, the government</p>
<p>could substance and there is a quantifiable number.</p>
<p>And if we had if we decided whether it was worth it or not,</p>
<p>we could decide.</p>
<p>But all I&rsquo;m saying is, it&rsquo;s something that we need to put on</p>
<p>the table.</p>
<p>Because every time a new president comes into town and</p>
<p>gets elected, they generally get this one big shot on goal.</p>
<p>You know, the last few presidents have tried to either,</p>
<p>you know, cut taxes or basically give these massive</p>
<p>economic stimulus packages.</p>
<p>And the net dollar effect of these things is now measured in</p>
<p>the trillions of dollars.</p>
<p>And I suspect that the net, you know, cost of subsidizing and</p>
<p>up solar energy that you&rsquo;re going to broadly deployed is</p>
<p>also in the trillions of dollars.</p>
<p>And we should just decide whether that isn&rsquo;t a better use</p>
<p>of the money.</p>
<p>All right, just to do some quick math here.</p>
<p>To boost your point, he almost nailed it.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>There are 85 million standalone homes in the US.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna assume none of them, for the sake of this</p>
<p>argument, have solar on them.</p>
<p>But 3% do, I think.</p>
<p>Average cost of putting solar on homes.</p>
<p>20 to 35,000.</p>
<p>I picked the number 30,000.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>But but in Australia, it costs 5,000.</p>
<p>Okay, they have a cheaper system or something?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s because of all the nonsense that exists in the</p>
<p>United States.</p>
<p>Subsidize it.</p>
<p>So but just to give the raw cost here, if it was $30,000 to</p>
<p>put on it, you can do it for $5,000 a home, because Australia,</p>
<p>which is one sixth the size of America, is able to do it with</p>
<p>no subsidies direct to the consumer for $5,000 in</p>
<p>installation.</p>
<p>So that price is possible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to pick the $30,000 crazy price in America by $2.5</p>
<p>trillion to put solar on every home, the end.</p>
<p>Like, we&rsquo;re, you were $30 trillion in debt, 10% of our</p>
<p>debt would make us energy independent forever, the plan</p>
<p>gets better when you do math.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>And think of the think of the amount of savings you do to the</p>
<p>environment.</p>
<p>Think of the lack I don&rsquo;t know if you saw this, but there was a</p>
<p>UN report about the criticality and importance of emerging</p>
<p>wildfire threats to our ecosystem and our ecology.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t you know, for all of us that lived in California, do</p>
<p>you guys remember how the sky was orange and red two years</p>
<p>ago, or those?</p>
<p>Yeah, crazy pictures from Los Angeles.</p>
<p>So if you if you have a have less of a reliance on these</p>
<p>aging utilities and these utilities infrastructure, there</p>
<p>will be less forest fires, the air will be cleaner, people</p>
<p>will be more resilient.</p>
<p>Think of the times that for example, in Texas, where there</p>
<p>was a massive freeze, right where people were shut out of</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t have power because the actual traditional</p>
<p>utilities were shut down.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s only two and a half trillion dollars, I think we</p>
<p>should have done this yesterday.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe the number is that low.</p>
<p>Considering the things that when we put two and a half</p>
<p>trillion dollar price tags on things and spend the cost of</p>
<p>upgrading, I&rsquo;m just pulling some numbers here off of the</p>
<p>internet, but replacing our electrical grid would be 5</p>
<p>trillion.</p>
<p>So if you think about the replacement cost of the actual</p>
<p>grid, which we&rsquo;re going to have to do at some point, and the</p>
<p>upgrade cost of 500 billion a year, or the maintenance of</p>
<p>500 billion a year, this actually starts to seem very</p>
<p>reasonable and achievable if we had the will, which means we</p>
<p>need to have some politicians who actually aren&rsquo;t in the</p>
<p>pocket of a number of jobs that Biden would create if he</p>
<p>actually ran with this, then and because you do need a lot of</p>
<p>local installation capability and other jobs, you would create</p>
<p>hundreds of 1000s, maybe even millions of jobs in the United</p>
<p>States, they would be really well paying.</p>
<p>And you would be pushing us towards a completely energy</p>
<p>independent clean energy, you know, zero carbon future that</p>
<p>be transformation.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wonder how many hours of work it is to install, you</p>
<p>could actually do that math as well and figure out how many</p>
<p>jobs you create, and then how much tax those people pay and</p>
<p>then how much they spend of that money to put back into the</p>
<p>economy, you&rsquo;re probably getting a 30 40% rebate on that $2.5</p>
<p>trillion. So it becomes even better because of the high</p>
<p>paying jobs. All right, the markets are tanking. Obviously,</p>
<p>over the last couple of months.</p>
<p>Dow is down 11% year to date.</p>
<p>And of course, a lot of the growth socks, we&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>this over and over again from zoom to Netflix, Facebook,</p>
<p>Spotify, Coinbase, Twitter, all down over 50%.</p>
<p>Today, the market went down five 6% on the news and then</p>
<p>rebounded. Is this all priced in? And is this the bottom of</p>
<p>the market? Cathie Wood is supposedly buying and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if it&rsquo;s net buying or she just reallocating. But are we</p>
<p>now in the bargain hunting period of the market and we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>bottomed out the smart folks that I talked to who I really,</p>
<p>you know, look up to and respect, think that the bottom</p>
<p>in the S&amp;P is around 3800. And what we still need to do is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one last flush. And that last flush will really touch the big</p>
<p>cap companies but that growth is largely done sort of getting</p>
<p>taken to the woodshed. So in general, I think that so</p>
<p>generally buyers of growth now, sellers of value, and waiting</p>
<p>for this one last, you know, 400 point move down the S&amp;P and I</p>
<p>think people think it&rsquo;s roughly the bottom. Now, if there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>world war, obviously, who knows all that&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>So sacks, what&rsquo;s more shocking that we&rsquo;re almost at the bottom</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s people in the markets that Chamath really respects?</p>
<p>Speaking of people that we respect, so I think Brad</p>
<p>Gerstner has a really interesting take on this, which</p>
<p>is that</p>
<p>sorry, I should also be clear that I&rsquo;m recruiting this one</p>
<p>person who I really respect, you know, so they&rsquo;re both got it.</p>
<p>So, Brad Gerstner has published a couple of charts showing</p>
<p>basically multiples in the internet index and among SaaS</p>
<p>companies over the last whatever dozen years or so. And what you</p>
<p>can see is that over the last two years during COVID, there</p>
<p>was a huge spike in multiples for internet companies and for</p>
<p>SaaS companies. And that over the last really since November,</p>
<p>last three, four months has now come down. And as of I would</p>
<p>say last week, it was right at about the historical trend. And</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s starting to go under the historical trends. So from a</p>
<p>bargain hunting standpoint, you&rsquo;d have to say that this is</p>
<p>the first time that we&rsquo;ve been below the average for a few</p>
<p>years. Now, that&rsquo;s not to say it can&rsquo;t go down even more,</p>
<p>because in the same way that you can be above trend, you can</p>
<p>also be below trend. And if this war escalates and</p>
<p>metastasizes, it will go down more. But if this conflict can</p>
<p>stay localized, and the economy doesn&rsquo;t go into a recession,</p>
<p>because of everything that&rsquo;s happened, then yes, this might</p>
<p>be bargain hunting.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the chart for everybody to take a look at. From January</p>
<p>20 to January 22, the two years of the pandemic. And I think</p>
<p>this is times for looking sales. If I&rsquo;m if I&rsquo;m reading a correct,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the full chart here. I just have a screenshot</p>
<p>of it. A portion of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s enterprise value. Yeah, it&rsquo;s enterprise</p>
<p>value divided by like forward looking revenue, which is you</p>
<p>were kind of saying is like ARR. Yeah, it&rsquo;s sort of like ARR.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like revenue.</p>
<p>And so yeah, we had this 15 x, we went up to 40 50 x private</p>
<p>market deals going at 100 200 x. Those days are over time. And</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s we&rsquo;ve talked about that ad nauseum. One of the interesting</p>
<p>things that I&rsquo;m seeing is I think people are looking at</p>
<p>businesses that have been corrected. And saying, Hey, what</p>
<p>is the true value of this? And I think the best example is</p>
<p>Peloton new CFO, the CFO of Netflix, I gotta go. All right,</p>
<p>I gotta go. I love you. I love you. I love you. Stay safe and</p>
<p>enjoy your vacation. Cheers. Now. So I just without your</p>
<p>mouth here, I just want to talk a little bit. Have you guys</p>
<p>watched what happened with Peloton and the CFO coming in</p>
<p>and just really revitalizing that business very quickly.</p>
<p>By the way, Jason, I&rsquo;ll say one thing. I think two weeks ago,</p>
<p>if you pulled the market, there would probably have or if you</p>
<p>looked at the the trading prices of bonds, you probably</p>
<p>would have assumed a 95% chance of a half point rate hike in</p>
<p>March. And as of today, my guess is that the probability of</p>
<p>that is below 5%. And you&rsquo;re probably assuming, you know, a</p>
<p>quarter point rate hike, or maybe even a deferral at this</p>
<p>point. And I think that&rsquo;s one of the things that&rsquo;s keeping the</p>
<p>market up instead of tanking so much. People are predicting</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s been such bad news that they&rsquo;ll push it out. Yeah,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re assuming that under conditions of great uncertainty</p>
<p>like this, the Fed cannot act as aggressively as they were</p>
<p>planning to act interest. And as a result, that that rate hike</p>
<p>would be pushed out. And it would continue to kind of keep</p>
<p>prices somewhat inflated, and continue to support the market</p>
<p>with cheaper capital and liquidity. So you know, a lot</p>
<p>of capital around the world is going to get locked up as armed</p>
<p>conflict kind of comes to bear. And when that happens, you know,</p>
<p>markets will tighten up and prices will be affected. And so</p>
<p>the Fed in in traditional and typical times would want to have</p>
<p>an incentive or would have a motivation to, you know, inject</p>
<p>liquidity into the markets. And so this is not a great time to</p>
<p>do a half point rate hike. And so it&rsquo;s almost certain at this</p>
<p>point that they&rsquo;re not going to do a half point rate hike feels</p>
<p>to be like huge setup right now people have capitulated the</p>
<p>markets gotten demolished, I just think there&rsquo;s some these</p>
<p>companies are still great. Great, great businesses out</p>
<p>there, and some great companies to invest in some great stocks</p>
<p>to buy for all the way from technology through to</p>
<p>industrials, through to, you know, even some of the energy</p>
<p>companies that are going to benefit greatly from this</p>
<p>commodity cycle, we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re kind of in the middle of. And so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be, you know, I think an opportunity to move</p>
<p>away from speculative behavior into real kind of cherry picking</p>
<p>productive, cash generating businesses in the next, you</p>
<p>know, or even growth businesses that are actual, you know, value</p>
<p>craters. So versus being like 10 year speculative kind of bet.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a great time to kind of be looking for businesses you</p>
<p>really like to own, to identify them to make investments and to</p>
<p>hold those investments for a very long period of time. You</p>
<p>know, you&rsquo;re not going to find a lot of market conditions like</p>
<p>this. I mean, if we all went back to March of 2020, and you</p>
<p>remember, the S&amp;P was 2300. I was gonna buy Disney, I never</p>
<p>got around to it. Yeah. So like, if at that point, you pick</p>
<p>businesses that you knew were going to be durable businesses</p>
<p>and that you loved, and you thought we&rsquo;re going to have legs</p>
<p>to them, you bought everything from Alphabet to Disney, to</p>
<p>Lockheed Martin, you know, you could have done tremendously</p>
<p>well. So now&rsquo;s a great time to kind of be looking for</p>
<p>businesses that you really like, and to buy a stake in them.</p>
<p>Yeah, forget, forget about trying to time the bottom.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fool&rsquo;s errand. Right? No, no, if you want to buy</p>
<p>stuff, you want to hold for 10 years, things are relatively</p>
<p>cheap relative to a time horizon, the sacks pointed out</p>
<p>and, and Gertner pointed out, so things are relatively cheap,</p>
<p>find businesses you like to own and buy them cheap. They could</p>
<p>get cheaper, but they&rsquo;re kind of at the bottom end. I think</p>
<p>the whole timeframe around like speculative stuff is kind of</p>
<p>wiped out. Like I think that that that that era is gone now.</p>
<p>What are you saying?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s that plus, I think one of the things that</p>
<p>happened is that people are realizing now that the burst of</p>
<p>activity, especially like an e commerce type companies that</p>
<p>happened during the pandemic, that was not ongoing,</p>
<p>sustainable growth, it was one time growth. In fact, in many</p>
<p>cases, it was sort of worse than one time growth, which is it</p>
<p>was pulled forward growth, meaning that growth in the</p>
<p>future will be lower because you pulled forward that revenue.</p>
<p>Well, I think Peloton might be a good example. I mean, everyone</p>
<p>bought them during the pandemic. But then after the</p>
<p>pandemic, everyone who needs one has got one already. So</p>
<p>it could also be cars, right? Like people were desperate to</p>
<p>buy cars, and now there&rsquo;s not a right. So what what happened is</p>
<p>not only have multiples gone down, but these companies were</p>
<p>being comped based on growth rates that were unsustainable.</p>
<p>And so now they&rsquo;re all revising their forecast down. So it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>double whammy. And Brad&rsquo;s made this point. But what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting right now is the markets are actually rallying.</p>
<p>And I think it might be because of this latest Biden news at</p>
<p>this press conference. So the important point here is that</p>
<p>Biden did not sanction Putin directly, there&rsquo;s talk about</p>
<p>sanctioning him personally, or and he also did not remove</p>
<p>Russia from the swift system, which is like sort of the key</p>
<p>banking system. And I don&rsquo;t know if this is because Biden</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t want to do it, or because Europe won&rsquo;t support the</p>
<p>move. Pretty clear Europe doesn&rsquo;t want to do it. So no one</p>
<p>is willing to suffer too much economic loss here to defend</p>
<p>Ukraine, nevermind sending troops. So it seems to me that</p>
<p>the signal here is that both militarily and in terms of</p>
<p>economic interest, Europe does not want further escalation. And</p>
<p>that may be why the market is rallying. Also, the Fed may hold</p>
<p>off on interest rate increases, while this is all going on. So,</p>
<p>you know, sometimes markets can act in funny ways.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re forward looking, people are putting money at</p>
<p>stake, so they have skin in the game. So it&rsquo;s, you know, the</p>
<p>people can talk all they want about what&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>with the markets, but unless they&rsquo;re placing bets, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of cheap talk. And here people are actually placing</p>
<p>bets on stocks, they think will do well in the future.</p>
<p>Skin in the game, people look, their economic interests are</p>
<p>skin in the game, having people&rsquo;s sons and daughters go</p>
<p>off to fight and die in some foreign war, that is real skin</p>
<p>in the game. What is not skin in the game is people tweeting,</p>
<p>you know, their moral outrage and condemnation and whipping</p>
<p>things up. And, you know, we should not be listening to that</p>
<p>and calling everyone who disagrees them traitors, because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening to, you know, this is a time for cooler heads</p>
<p>for avail.</p>
<p>You and I are going to actually agree on this. And we&rsquo;re both</p>
<p>going to agree that Trump and Pompeo should not be fawning</p>
<p>over Putin.</p>
<p>Yeah, but Jason</p>
<p>never commented on that. Let&rsquo;s get people want to hear us get</p>
<p>into it. Well, I mean, you can&rsquo;t support them fawning over</p>
<p>Putin like that. Do you? I can&rsquo;t imagine you</p>
<p>like I heard I heard what what Trump said when he was saying,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t hear the Pompeo quotes. I can&rsquo;t speak to that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a genius.</p>
<p>Look, listen, you know, sometimes Trump is being</p>
<p>sarcastic when he says things like, Oh, what a beauty, you</p>
<p>know, he means the opposite. And I think the point Trump was</p>
<p>making wasn&rsquo;t really about Putin being so great. The point I</p>
<p>heard Trump making was that if he were president, this wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be happening. Now, you can disagree with that. It may be</p>
<p>true or untrue. But that was the real point he was making. I</p>
<p>think that you&rsquo;re letting you know, the political partisans</p>
<p>try to whip this thing up. And as part again, as part of this</p>
<p>meme of anybody who doesn&rsquo;t support what I want must be a</p>
<p>traitor. It must be in the pocket of truth of Putin.</p>
<p>We have to use this meme warfare to get people free bird</p>
<p>to shame these politicians into backing like the solar plan and</p>
<p>doing something meaningful like this, like and backing nuclear,</p>
<p>how do we get the politicians to reflect energy independence as</p>
<p>a priority? It feels like it&rsquo;s not a priority for them.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, the one of the good things about American</p>
<p>democracy is that politicians are generally pretty responsive</p>
<p>to what their constituents want and believe. So they use</p>
<p>polling data. And that polling data drives, you know, if they</p>
<p>want to get reelected, they better do what the polls are</p>
<p>telling them people want them to do. And so ultimately, if you</p>
<p>can kind of influence people broadly in the United States,</p>
<p>and that can that can go both ways, by the way,</p>
<p>special interest to and you have people with weird ideas,</p>
<p>right? Like, yeah, but generally, like if something is</p>
<p>deeply unpopular, politician risks not getting reelected,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not going to kind of run to do that. And if something</p>
<p>is very popular, even though it may not be the right thing by</p>
<p>some objective framework, you know, they would still run to do</p>
<p>that. So, you know, I do think that there&rsquo;s, you know, some</p>
<p>degree of work to be done around, you know, framing for</p>
<p>people broadly, you know, via the work, maybe that we do on</p>
<p>our podcast, but I think more importantly, on a repeated way</p>
<p>and in a way that&rsquo;s kind of inspiring and inclusive, will</p>
<p>drive people to kind of want to see these changes happen. And</p>
<p>ultimately, politicians should respond.</p>
<p>Can I make one other point to your thing about, you know, who</p>
<p>today would be considered, you know, in the words of Jen</p>
<p>Pisaki, parroting Russian talking points, Barack Obama,</p>
<p>if Obama today, were out there saying exactly what he told the</p>
<p>Atlantic magazine back in, I think it was 2012, or 14. If he</p>
<p>was saying that today, he&rsquo;d be accused of being in Putin&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pocket, and being a Putin apologist and a traitor and all</p>
<p>this kind of stuff. Because he said that in that interview, he</p>
<p>said, Listen, Putin was always very businesslike, he was</p>
<p>punctual, he showed up, he wanted to negotiate and deal.</p>
<p>Basically, he sounded like a guy who, look, we may disagree</p>
<p>with him about everything. But he wasn&rsquo;t a madman, he was</p>
<p>someone you could talk to, he was a coldly ruthless, but</p>
<p>rational actor. And that&rsquo;s basically what Obama said, he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>someone you could talk turkey with. And if you say that today</p>
<p>that, hey, maybe we could negotiate our way out of this</p>
<p>with Putin, you&rsquo;re accused of being, you know, a puppet of</p>
<p>his. Yeah,</p>
<p>well, the concept of starting a war in this day and age is just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s crazy, like, it is crazy that he&rsquo;s starting this war and</p>
<p>putting all these people at risk. And we don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>what the goal is. He&rsquo;s not even asked for anything, like, what</p>
<p>is he exactly asking for? So he may not be, he may have been</p>
<p>rational then, or maybe Obama was trying to steer him towards</p>
<p>rationality and praising him publicly to get that more</p>
<p>rational Putin to show up. This feels like irrational, that we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what his goal is, like, the fact that the world</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t say, if we gave him x, he would do y, is I think his</p>
<p>strategy, Putin&rsquo;s always like to be this, like, unpredictable</p>
<p>madman, right?</p>
<p>No, I mean, we just said that he&rsquo;s a coldly ruthless rational</p>
<p>actor as sort of the opposite of a madman. I mean, his red</p>
<p>lines have been clear. He&rsquo;s been stating them for for years.</p>
<p>The problem is that again, we&rsquo;re conducting referring him</p>
<p>to murdering opponents of his and oh, there&rsquo;s no question that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s ruthless. He&rsquo;s an authoritarian, call him a</p>
<p>dictator if you want. I&rsquo;ve tweeted in support of Alexei</p>
<p>Navalny. So I get it. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s a madman. He</p>
<p>has desires and interests. And it&rsquo;s the job of diplomats to</p>
<p>figure out how to conduct diplomacy and negotiation with</p>
<p>people you disagree with. And one of the problems we have</p>
<p>today is again, we&rsquo;ve Twitterized everything. So, you</p>
<p>know, we basically figure out the first step is, who are the</p>
<p>people who should be cancelled? You know, who&rsquo;s wearing the</p>
<p>white hat, who&rsquo;s wearing the black hat, let&rsquo;s all rise up and</p>
<p>virtue signal and moral denunciation. And, you know,</p>
<p>stick our fingers in our ears and not listen to the other</p>
<p>side. And, and listen, that that is a way to find yourself in</p>
<p>greater conflicts, not avoid them. Yeah. All right. So just</p>
<p>wrapping up here. Let&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s wrap with sacks his favorite</p>
<p>part of the show. sacks his favorite moment where he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>super engaged in learning. He&rsquo;s got his thinking cap on he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>taking notes. And that is the science corner. No, not</p>
<p>what about Vendetta Corner? I thought you&rsquo;re gonna say</p>
<p>Vendetta Corner. Yeah, what about</p>
<p>a quarter this quarter is actually my favorite part of</p>
<p>the show. It is now people love Vendetta Corner in the</p>
<p>Twitter community spaces. Who loves it because Twitter is all</p>
<p>about vendettas. But I have no vendettas this week.</p>
<p>What are you doing with your time? Yeah, I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m trying to</p>
<p>advocate that this is time for cooler heads prevail. And so,</p>
<p>um, Oh, for fuck&rsquo;s sake, start a fight with somebody. Aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you fighting with Paul Graham? There&rsquo;s nobody here. You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking the week off for ski week. I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fighting over anything. It&rsquo;s not I can&rsquo;t not that I can think</p>
<p>of. All right. For the dictator Chamath Palihapitiya, the</p>
<p>sultan of science, David Friedberg, and the rain man</p>
<p>himself. David sacks. I&rsquo;m Jay cow. And we&rsquo;ll see you all at</p>
<p>the all in summit in May 15 1617. You can go to the website</p>
<p>summit.all in podcast.co where you just type all in some of the</p>
<p>all in summit into Google and find it May 15 to 17 in Miami,</p>
<p>Florida, we&rsquo;re doing it at the New World Symphony. And we have</p>
<p>a page there where you can vote on speakers can be three days of</p>
<p>fun. We have a scholarship there if you can&rsquo;t afford the</p>
<p>regular ticket. And you can apply for a scholarship if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a super fan. And we&rsquo;ll look forward to seeing you</p>
<p>there and go vote for some speakers. Bye bye. I love you</p>
<p>besties. Let your winners ride. Rain Man David sack.</p>
<p>We open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy</p>
<p>with it. I love you besties.</p>
<p>Besties are gone. That&rsquo;s my dog taking a notice in your</p>
<p>driveway.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge</p>
<p>orgy because they&rsquo;re all just useless. It&rsquo;s like this like</p>
<p>sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
