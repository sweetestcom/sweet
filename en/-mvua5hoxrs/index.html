<p>that&rsquo;s the handle or guy at from YouTube</p>
<p>just started on your nutritional yeast</p>
<p>and wondering if that&rsquo;s what I do let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>excuse me need to treat my Tremors or do</p>
<p>I need to take something else I&rsquo;m on a</p>
<p>20-hour fast on keto every day</p>
<p>well I&rsquo;m not sure but we do know that um</p>
<p>Tremors could be related to something</p>
<p>with a B1 deficiency but there&rsquo;s other</p>
<p>reasons too relating to dopamine I did a</p>
<p>video on all the causes of Tremors</p>
<p>um you should check it out</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>one little tip that I actually a little</p>
<p>technique that I tried in practice it</p>
<p>seemed to work for some people you might</p>
<p>want to try so if you&rsquo;re if you have</p>
<p>this Tremor which is kind of a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an automatic thing that you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>your body is not controlling it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>doing its own thing try to exaggerate</p>
<p>the Tremor and make your hand have a</p>
<p>Tremor and see if that doesn&rsquo;t help it</p>
<p>it works with stuttering too you like</p>
<p>how the person stutter on purpose and</p>
<p>all of a sudden now they can&rsquo;t stutter</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really interesting wow that is</p>
<p>interesting here&rsquo;s another this is an</p>
<p>interesting question all these people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>handles sweet potatoes potes sweet</p>
<p>potatoes from YouTube</p>
<p>are we supposed to wait an hour or more</p>
<p>before brushing our teeth after a meal</p>
<p>what are your thoughts Dr Berg</p>
<p>you always have to wait an hour now I I</p>
<p>have I don&rsquo;t think it matters I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a trivial thing that won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>make a big difference one way or the</p>
<p>other so brush your teeth when you have</p>
<p>time</p>
<p>um whether it&rsquo;s immediately after 10</p>
<p>minutes an hour I think you&rsquo;ll be good</p>
<p>to go good wait six months and they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>pull them all so gotta come up with some</p>
<p>kind of compromise there okay why don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>we kick it off with our first exciting</p>
<p>quiz question and uh audience they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not all true false this time so you can</p>
<p>have to put your thinking cap on and</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the first one</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>best food to prevent age-related macular</p>
<p>degeneration now the immacula is uh the</p>
<p>little back part of your eye to help you</p>
<p>see</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a condition called</p>
<p>age-related macular degeneration like</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the best food to prevent that</p>
<p>okay climb on it audience</p>
<p>now let&rsquo;s go back to social media again</p>
<p>this time it&rsquo;s Tina from YouTube</p>
<p>using a recognizable name what are the</p>
<p>most important supplements to take every</p>
<p>day for Optimal Health and well-being</p>
<p>you have a short list doc</p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s the the basic ones that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supposed to be getting you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>supposed to be getting from food but</p>
<p>there are certain nutrients that are</p>
<p>really hard to get to from food</p>
<p>uh and that would be vitamin D at the</p>
<p>top of the list it&rsquo;s probably almost</p>
<p>impossible to get your requirements for</p>
<p>vitamin D and uh</p>
<p>you know for for some reason people were</p>
<p>wearing more clothes nowadays so they</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t go outside to get enough</p>
<p>sun exposure to get the vitamin D so</p>
<p>um our bodies were designed probably not</p>
<p>to wear as much clothes but um it&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of necessary nowadays to wear clothes</p>
<p>but the point is vitamin D would be at</p>
<p>the top of the list</p>
<p>some other things that are really hard</p>
<p>to get uh which which are essential is</p>
<p>the trace minerals because you need that</p>
<p>in building protein not just for your</p>
<p>muscles but all the biochemistry</p>
<p>involved with hormones and metabolism</p>
<p>and you name it so we have the trace</p>
<p>minerals</p>
<p>vitamin D</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>some of the B vitamins sometimes um</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t get as many because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing a lot of heavy carbs refined carbs</p>
<p>uh and then another really</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>important one would be the omega-3 fatty</p>
<p>acids so I think those would be probably</p>
<p>more important than others all right</p>
<p>very good well let&rsquo;s go to the green</p>
<p>room and Nicholas from Belgium has very</p>
<p>astute looking glasses so I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to hear some fascinating</p>
<p>commentary with him and if he it</p>
<p>remembers to unmute himself he is now on</p>
<p>with Dr burgoy through a one 30 second</p>
<p>question please</p>
<p>hello uh Dr Burke</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m a little bit confused about</p>
<p>proteins because</p>
<p>um when I use your calculator it says</p>
<p>like 62 grams of proteins and um well uh</p>
<p>people they scare me a little bit that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s way too low</p>
<p>but I tend to believe you because I&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>big fan and I follow everything what you</p>
<p>say and do so I just want to know</p>
<p>can you</p>
<p>is this 62 enough and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>part two of the question is when do you</p>
<p>advise to take the proteins or yeah</p>
<p>so so good question I think the</p>
<p>confusion is</p>
<p>within the um when we say protein we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about the protein in protein</p>
<p>foods so if you were to weigh</p>
<p>steak</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>um it would be a lot more than</p>
<p>you know 50 or 60 grams of protein</p>
<p>um because probably over half of it or</p>
<p>more than that is water you have</p>
<p>connective tissue you have all these</p>
<p>other stuff so we&rsquo;re talking about the</p>
<p>actual protein inside the protein let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>take for example eggs for example uh one</p>
<p>egg is seven grams of protein</p>
<p>how many times</p>
<p>does 7 go into</p>
<p>um well how many how many eggs would you</p>
<p>have to eat</p>
<p>to achieve 60 grams of protein</p>
<p>this is a trick question yeah a lot</p>
<p>right now so anyways probably uh</p>
<p>for those people who are not good as</p>
<p>math probably be more than six uh right</p>
<p>or more than 10 eggs right so probably</p>
<p>11 eggs so</p>
<p>if someone were to say</p>
<p>wow 11 eggs a day is not an odd protein</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s going to give you 60 60</p>
<p>grams</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re thinking of the actual</p>
<p>weight of the actual food itself not the</p>
<p>protein in that food well I I&rsquo;m not I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry to interrupt you I&rsquo;m not really</p>
<p>concerned about the the friends or some</p>
<p>people that I was talking I was</p>
<p>listening to some podcast about a</p>
<p>protein a so-called expert Dr Layman and</p>
<p>he was talking about around 90 grams per</p>
<p>day and I think he probably uses the</p>
<p>same reference point as you so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like 30 grams difference and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just a little bit like yeah and I think</p>
<p>if I eat too much protein it takes me</p>
<p>out of ketosis so that&rsquo;s a little bit my</p>
<p>my difficulty</p>
<p>very good question</p>
<p>um I created some videos in that but</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s hard to find but but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some</p>
<p>variance of how much protein someone</p>
<p>needs depending on their age depending</p>
<p>on their metabolism depending on how</p>
<p>much exercise they do</p>
<p>um like you take a bodybuilder for</p>
<p>example they&rsquo;re going to go on the high</p>
<p>end they&rsquo;ll probably do</p>
<p>well over a hundred grams of protein per</p>
<p>day</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I know with even myself I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>experimented with more protein less</p>
<p>protein how I feel you know and you can</p>
<p>look at your urine is it foamy is that</p>
<p>could that be some byproducts of too</p>
<p>much protein</p>
<p>um how healthy is your liver to deal</p>
<p>with all this extra protein</p>
<p>it is true that there&rsquo;s a certain amount</p>
<p>of protein that is used to replace your</p>
<p>body tissues okay that that because we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a storage so what happens to</p>
<p>the extra protein that we don&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t turn into body tissue well it</p>
<p>gets converted into glucose</p>
<p>now is this the same as eating sugar no</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re starting off with a protein and</p>
<p>it takes time and it&rsquo;s not like eating</p>
<p>white bread something like that but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s being um</p>
<p>affected by other hormones too the</p>
<p>opposing hormone to insulin called</p>
<p>glucagon so it&rsquo;s not near going to be a</p>
<p>problem as sugar but it does turn into</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>glucose it&rsquo;s converted because the um</p>
<p>the carbon chains of that that amino</p>
<p>acid so the thing that um what I would</p>
<p>do if I were you</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re ever confused about protein</p>
<p>for three days just consume 60 grams of</p>
<p>protein and then for the next three days</p>
<p>do 90 grams and just see how you feel</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ll know for sure look at energy</p>
<p>look at your sleep your digestion and</p>
<p>see how you feel because they&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to determine the exact</p>
<p>amount based on all these other</p>
<p>variables you know and you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>but the point is that the type of</p>
<p>protein is important to bioavailable</p>
<p>protein eggs and meat versus trying to</p>
<p>get your protein from grains or nuts or</p>
<p>things like that or beans which you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna need to eat a lot more and then</p>
<p>with that comes a lot of carbohydrate</p>
<p>so animal props are in preferred I think</p>
<p>absolutely it&rsquo;s the most bioavailable</p>
<p>eggs at the top of the list and also</p>
<p>just so you know</p>
<p>um the requirements for protein are kind</p>
<p>of a myth anyway because we don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>require protein we require amino acids</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>the question is where do we get the most</p>
<p>bioavailable amino acids well from</p>
<p>animal food animal protein and then the</p>
<p>question is</p>
<p>um can we break those down with the</p>
<p>amount of acid in our stomach</p>
<p>um hopefully yes</p>
<p>um so anyway it&rsquo;s um the amino acids</p>
<p>really is what we&rsquo;re looking for</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s great that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s an answer</p>
<p>to my question and I have a little a</p>
<p>small favor uh I make a very short I</p>
<p>used your golden latte a lot and now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s out of stock and um I have friends</p>
<p>living in Egypt in India because of my</p>
<p>work so now we&rsquo;re still some stock I</p>
<p>asked them to buy they are shipping them</p>
<p>to me I even went to Egypt because they</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t ship them just to pick them up</p>
<p>imagine so um I just uh I just I just</p>
<p>want to ask a favor if you could</p>
<p>reconsider to um to bring it back into</p>
<p>your uh range of products</p>
<p>glad you like it I definitely will</p>
<p>reconsider that</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s really just a matter of do</p>
<p>people want it you know I had a great</p>
<p>idea I thought it was a great idea to</p>
<p>produce that product from turmeric</p>
<p>um I loved it but then</p>
<p>apparently that there wasn&rsquo;t a lot of</p>
<p>people who did like it but there are</p>
<p>certain people that like it so I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>definitely consider it yeah thank you so</p>
<p>much yeah that&rsquo;s great hey Nicholas</p>
<p>listen just send me a hundred dollars</p>
<p>cash in an envelope and I&rsquo;ll make sure</p>
<p>it gets in the proper hands and I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll have a positive effect on uh</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re considering here thanks for</p>
<p>joining us in such a great call that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fantastic and while we were distracting</p>
<p>Nicholas</p>
<p>um with your great um Council we have an</p>
<p>answer to today&rsquo;s first quiz question</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s remind everybody what that was</p>
<p>it asks what&rsquo;s the best food to prevent</p>
<p>age-related macular degeneration or bone</p>
<p>site and 55 percent of our respondents</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s carrots fifteen percent say</p>
<p>sardines 15 say egg yolks which you just</p>
<p>spoke up and 15 say it&rsquo;s spinach or</p>
<p>sauerkraut</p>
<p>okay well</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s one of those things where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re all kind of right the official</p>
<p>name of the macula is called the machia</p>
<p>macula lutea macula</p>
<p>um and then lutia means yellow because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a certain pigment which is a</p>
<p>certain amount of carotenoids</p>
<p>so carotenoids what is that that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>a certain um it&rsquo;s like lutein zeaxanthin</p>
<p>which is basically um</p>
<p>in dark leaf leafy greens as well as egg</p>
<p>yolks</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s and I should have said Foods</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s multiple foods but I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s almost a tie between</p>
<p>the the carotenoids in the dark leafy</p>
<p>green vegetables and egg yolks</p>
<p>as well as</p>
<p>the which oh by the way you can also get</p>
<p>these these carotenoids in grass-fed</p>
<p>beef as well</p>
<p>um but also</p>
<p>omega-3 fatty acids it&rsquo;s called DHA</p>
<p>which we need in pretty much all of our</p>
<p>cells to protect ourselves like about</p>
<p>one to five percent of of that essential</p>
<p>fat makes up ourselves but guess what 50</p>
<p>to 60 percent of your macula is made</p>
<p>from DHA</p>
<p>which means that</p>
<p>um probably the most important nutrient</p>
<p>to help your eye is the DHA that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>omega-3 and that comes from fish oils</p>
<p>especially oily cold water fish</p>
<p>Herring</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>salmon</p>
<p>also oysters and seafood and other fatty</p>
<p>fishes you know like um cod liver oil</p>
<p>you know that would be good or Cod Liver</p>
<p>itself I don&rsquo;t know about Cod but I</p>
<p>think that the liver would give you more</p>
<p>and you can actually buy cod liver</p>
<p>so these are really important in the eye</p>
<p>and those phytonutrients</p>
<p>are there to like the carotenuse or</p>
<p>there is the sunscreen to protect you</p>
<p>against UV and blue light on the</p>
<p>computer if you do a lot of computer</p>
<p>work</p>
<p>um so and the same thing with the DHA so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very important to protect the eye</p>
<p>so first of all a lot of people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>eat fish anymore they don&rsquo;t do you know</p>
<p>organic grass-fed beef</p>
<p>uh they don&rsquo;t eat enough vegetables</p>
<p>right they they are very heavy with</p>
<p>carbs and they&rsquo;re very heavy with the</p>
<p>Omega through six fatty acids like the</p>
<p>soy and corn oil and Seed oils so you</p>
<p>can see why their eyes are getting so</p>
<p>bad right and um it might be hard to</p>
<p>believe but some people even need</p>
<p>glasses nowadays more than more than</p>
<p>ever so</p>
<p>um but not just visual but just uh</p>
<p>having problems with glaucoma and all</p>
<p>the other conditions with the eye when</p>
<p>blindness and losing the strength of the</p>
<p>macula I mean which is part of the</p>
<p>retina</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um anyway uh stay tuned for a more</p>
<p>complete video on that topic all right</p>
<p>very good and if you want to see videos</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll remind you once again that Dr Berg</p>
<p>has a great app that it&rsquo;s free and let&rsquo;s</p>

<p>Belgium Nicholas do you have this app</p>
<p>answer yes or no</p>
<p>oh he muted himself like a good guy</p>
<p>anyway if you don&rsquo;t you should get it</p>
<p>and so should everyone else well I I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t do I didn&rsquo;t use it yet but I will</p>
<p>oh thank you okay that&rsquo;s one sign up for</p>
<p>the app and there should be Millions</p>
<p>more so you folks please follow</p>
<p>Nicholas&rsquo;s lead and get the free app for</p>
<p>your phone and you&rsquo;ll be able to</p>
<p>discover all the videos at your</p>
<p>fingertips okay let&rsquo;s go ahead and kick</p>
<p>out the second question of the day and</p>
<p>it is as follows</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>which herb um</p>
<p>gives you</p>
<p>the antidote</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>poisonous snake venom poisonous</p>
<p>mushrooms as well as Tylenol overdose it</p>
<p>is the antidote to a lot of different</p>
<p>poisons what what herb would give you</p>
<p>that protection I think this would be</p>
<p>important to know and have have around</p>
<p>the house in case you happen to run into</p>
<p>a poisonous snake or a mushroom that you</p>
<p>just ate</p>
<p>all right well Dr Berg let&rsquo;s ask the</p>
<p>question does anyone actually listen to</p>
<p>your show well here&rsquo;s some evidence we&rsquo;d</p>
<p>like to say a good morning to all of our</p>
<p>viewers joining us today from the UK</p>
<p>Canada Mexico Indonesia Jordan Oman</p>
<p>Poland Ireland South Africa Bangladesh</p>
<p>Trinidad and Tobago Switzerland Japan</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m leaving for in a week the</p>
<p>Philippines Kenya Austria New Zealand</p>
<p>and all across these lovely United</p>
<p>States which will be evidenced later in</p>
<p>the Green Room we&rsquo;ve got some folks that</p>
<p>are right here in the contiguous</p>
<ol start="48">
<li>so let&rsquo;s see</li>
</ol>
<p>um what we should do next how about we</p>
<p>go to social media Janice from YouTube</p>
<p>what can I do to lower my blood pressure</p>
<p>naturally</p>
<p>well the two things that up into my mind</p>
<p>is make sure you have no vitamin D</p>
<p>uh if you in fact uh if you take too</p>
<p>much vitamin D sometimes your blood</p>
<p>pressure will end up even lower than it</p>
<p>should be</p>
<p>um and also potassium start consuming</p>
<p>potassium either in electrolyte powder</p>
<p>or just potassium foods which have to do</p>
<p>with all those vegetables and then third</p>
<p>thing is cut down your carbs that should</p>
<p>bring your blood pressure down there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>many other different remedies but I</p>
<p>think if you focus on those three items</p>
<p>blood pressure should come down within</p>
<p>normal range</p>
<p>all right very good let&rsquo;s see here let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go to Stephanie from YouTube thank you</p>
<p>Dr Berg for all of your hard work and</p>
<p>dedication towards helping others live</p>
<p>longer and healthier lives everyone</p>
<p>seems to be dropping your name these</p>
<p>days including my carrot card reader</p>
<p>goodness you&rsquo;re really getting around</p>
<p>with that I can tell you that and now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do another Shameless plug</p>
<p>for Dr Berg&rsquo;s products and I do use the</p>
<p>electrolyte pattern and I&rsquo;m telling you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a huge value because it&rsquo;s a big jug</p>
<p>you can get it two sizes but this lasts</p>
<p>forever because the very potent material</p>
<p>and the little scooper you can get tons</p>
<p>of stuff out and that is really a great</p>
<p>product so make sure you get some of</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>and uh there&rsquo;s that twenty dollars and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll send it to you uh Steve oh yeah</p>
<p>exactly any uh any Revenue to me</p>
<p>certainly a big help okay let&rsquo;s get my</p>
<p>mug off of there and let&rsquo;s go back to</p>
<p>social media</p>
<p>um let&rsquo;s see Hamid from Facebook what</p>
<p>can I do for uh testicular atrophy</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting smaller doc</p>
<p>the best nutrient is zinc</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s a trace mineral</p>
<p>it can help</p>
<p>uh testicular atrophy as well as a</p>
<p>decrease in testosterone a couple other</p>
<p>things are involved in that which would</p>
<p>be</p>
<p>stress</p>
<p>age</p>
<p>um and um</p>
<p>and so your immune system too if the</p>
<p>immune system is um if you have an</p>
<p>infection that can also affect that as</p>
<p>well like like there&rsquo;s certain viruses</p>
<p>that go in remission</p>
<p>that can really mess with your hormones</p>
<p>um so but I think that the key mineral</p>
<p>that I would focus on is zinc</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>there you go all right very good okay</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s move on the audience is still with</p>
<p>us and they have come together with some</p>
<p>answers for the second question which</p>
<p>asks which herbs give you the antidote</p>
<p>for poisonous snake venom poisonous uh</p>
<p>excuse me mushrooms as well as Tylenol</p>
<p>overdose and the audience claims eighty</p>
<p>percent of them say it&rsquo;s milk thistle 15</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s tadka and five percent say dark</p>
<p>chocolate which I enjoy</p>
<p>well the majority is right it is</p>
<p>definitely milk thistle wow okay</p>
<p>um milk thistle has amazing properties</p>
<p>for not just your liver but for the</p>
<p>kidney as well protection against if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on even medication which creates</p>
<p>a lot of side effects if you took milk</p>
<p>thistle it could to some degree protect</p>
<p>your cells from the medication so it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good it&rsquo;s it has a fascinating property</p>
<p>of cell protection and from many</p>
<p>different angles so um and it&rsquo;s a weed</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably growing in your backyard</p>
<p>right now you don&rsquo;t even know it</p>
<p>um problem is collecting all those seeds</p>
<p>and trying to extract them from all the</p>
<p>fluffy stuff that comes out which is</p>
<p>like kind of like these little</p>
<p>parachutes that that&rsquo;s kind of a pain in</p>
<p>the butt so I I think the best thing is</p>
<p>just to buy the tablets but milk thistle</p>
<p>is a great antidote um</p>
<p>that um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just good for so many things</p>
<p>especially it has the capacity to</p>
<p>prevent a fatty liver prevent cirrhosis</p>
<p>prevent um liver enzymes from going up</p>
<p>too high</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a pretty amazing and also Tucka</p>
<p>is also good if you combine Taco with it</p>
<p>you got a very powerful</p>
<p>one-two punch</p>
<p>well very good we&rsquo;ll listen the list</p>
<p>grows and others around the world want</p>
<p>to be recognized and so we&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>another shout out to our viewers in the</p>
<p>Czech Republic Barbados Saudi Arabia</p>
<p>turkey Portugal and Iran so welcome all</p>
<p>of you to the spot for Better Health</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see now</p>
<p>um so let me get rid of that question so</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t ask that again</p>
<p>um sorry to include you all in my</p>
<p>administrative duties folks but we just</p>
<p>have to make sure it&rsquo;s as perfect to</p>
<p>show as possible let&rsquo;s see okay Kathy</p>
<p>from Facebook what should we do to treat</p>
<p>eye floaters</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s usually um</p>
<p>protein that builds up in the eye and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a very great remedy it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>soluble I think it&rsquo;s uh I&rsquo;m not mistaken</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called MSM and it comes in drops</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s been known to help with those</p>
<p>floaters but I would also make sure your</p>
<p>basic diet is um good because you could</p>
<p>be breaking down pro protein because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a catabolic State because your</p>
<p>cortisol is too high or you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>too much sugar but that&rsquo;s I would always</p>
<p>go after that first</p>
<p>okay very good morning dew from Facebook</p>
<p>what causes white marks on our</p>
<p>fingernails</p>
<p>well that is a classic zinc deficiency</p>
<p>which you can become depleted if you eat</p>
<p>a lot of sugar so if that little white</p>
<p>dot is right in the center of the nail</p>
<p>and your nails grow every six months we</p>
<p>know about three months ago you had a</p>
<p>birthday party and you ate the whole</p>
<p>cake</p>
<p>all right very good why don&rsquo;t we go back</p>
<p>over to our green room and this time</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go to Pasadena California</p>
<p>and Easter is on with us let me unmute</p>
<p>her and I trust that she&rsquo;s doing the</p>
<p>same and Easter you&rsquo;re on for your one</p>
<p>question in 30 seconds go</p>
<p>thank you so much this is like winning</p>
<p>the lottery</p>
<p>I am new to Dr Berg uh even though my</p>
<p>husband has had me order the the seek</p>
<p>help but I want to know just at 64 years</p>
<p>old and nothing else is working for me</p>
<p>where to get started with all the</p>
<p>information that you have out there in</p>
<p>your videos</p>
<p>nothing is working</p>
<p>you know so whatever you suggest I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start there well first of all you</p>
<p>look probably not even 40 years old so</p>
<p>no kidding what are you doing must be</p>
<p>working but um can you give me um like</p>
<p>something else to go on like as far as a</p>
<p>symptom</p>
<p>yes well</p>
<p>um I was one I&rsquo;m one year in on using</p>
<p>being prescribed</p>
<p>cholesterol medication because I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>tried to get my cholesterol down uh</p>
<p>below 200 for many years and wasn&rsquo;t able</p>
<p>to do it</p>
<p>um I am postmanopausal</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a partial hysterectomy I&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>stressed out even though I I work out a</p>
<p>lot and</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;ve even tried for the last year to</p>
<p>um do intermittent fasting with my</p>
<p>sister who lived in Missouri</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s been very successful and I&rsquo;ve lost</p>
<p>two pounds</p>
<p>you know and I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m fasting like 16 to</p>
<p>18 hours a night so got it so a couple</p>
<p>things real quick</p>
<p>um when you go to drberg.com click</p>
<p>videos and I actually have the first</p>
<p>video you should watch and that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>you start and then there&rsquo;s a video two</p>
<p>and then three but when you go through</p>
<p>menopause</p>
<p>um you have this change you have to</p>
<p>change from</p>
<p>um no longer</p>
<p>utilize much much of your ovaries so the</p>
<p>backup organ so you can produce the same</p>
<p>hormones as the ovary did is the</p>
<p>adrenals and the raw material to make</p>
<p>those hormones is you guessed it</p>
<p>cholesterol</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so what the body</p>
<p>um if there&rsquo;s stress involved the body</p>
<p>is going to make more stress hormones</p>
<p>from cholesterol</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s gonna actually your body</p>
<p>actually makes cholesterol too so it</p>
<p>might just be generating more</p>
<p>cholesterol because you have stress</p>
<p>leaving the other hormones high and dry</p>
<p>and that could be what you&rsquo;re running up</p>
<p>against so what do you do</p>
<p>um well yes intermittent fasting is one</p>
<p>thing but the concept of it&rsquo;s not lose</p>
<p>weight to get healthy it&rsquo;s get healthy</p>
<p>to lose weight uh you can focus in on</p>
<p>your health first so regardless of how</p>
<p>much weight you lose don&rsquo;t even worry</p>
<p>about that initially what you want to do</p>
<p>is you want to do this combination of</p>
<p>healthy keto with intermittent fasting</p>
<p>to achieve the first goal which would be</p>
<p>no more appetite so your appetite goes</p>
<p>away then we know it&rsquo;s working it means</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re burning your fat and you may</p>
<p>be in a situation especially after</p>
<p>menopause where you have to build up</p>
<p>more muscle protein which does take</p>
<p>um some initial</p>
<p>work</p>
<p>um and so if that happens you might not</p>
<p>know you might not see as much weight</p>
<p>loss you might just see</p>
<p>um a shrinkage of your clothes because</p>
<p>the just the the weight of protein is</p>
<p>heavier than fat per volume</p>
<p>so um I I wouldn&rsquo;t restrict</p>
<p>fat foods as much as I would restrict</p>
<p>carb foods because the sugar and carbs</p>
<p>turn into cholesterol</p>
<p>and then</p>
<p>I have a lot of videos on stress all</p>
<p>these other things you can do and then</p>
<p>what will happen is the I think your</p>
<p>lipid profiles will come in check you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>start feeling better you&rsquo;ll start to</p>
<p>lose weight but a normal the most you</p>
<p>can lose per week</p>
<p>is two pounds and that&rsquo;s for a really</p>
<p>young healthy person</p>
<p>um if you lose one pound a week that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still good</p>
<p>um sometimes people lose even a half a</p>
<p>pound a week and that&rsquo;s still okay</p>
<p>especially in the beginning</p>
<p>so just get the basic thing in and um</p>
<p>watch more of my videos so you have that</p>
<p>understanding of what normal is and what</p>
<p>to expect and then um I think um you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do very well</p>
<p>so much thank you thank you so much for</p>
<p>being another great caller and sticking</p>
<p>with the Rules of Engagement here on the</p>
<p>Dr Berg show and keeping things moving</p>
<p>along so let&rsquo;s go back to social media</p>
<p>and treat them with some love Leah</p>
<p>sorry Leela from YouTube best way to</p>
<p>treat allergies in children</p>
<p>bee pollen bee pollen is a good remedy</p>
<p>for allergies in children and of course</p>
<p>I think you are you talking about</p>
<p>seasonal allergies or food allergies I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>guessing it&rsquo;s seasonal but bee pollen is</p>
<p>good and because the</p>
<p>um and there&rsquo;s other things too as a</p>
<p>natural and a histamine there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a great product</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s a couple products out there</p>
<p>if you took like a glandular extract</p>
<p>like a liver like a grass-fed</p>
<p>freeze-dried liver extract and even the</p>
<p>kidney extract too grass-fed</p>
<p>freeze-dried kidney</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like from beef</p>
<p>um they both have very potent</p>
<p>um enzymes to help you break down</p>
<p>histamines</p>
<p>to help you with um especially the</p>
<p>seasonal allergies that might be two</p>
<p>remedies that I would recommend for sure</p>
<p>all right as well as the people I guess</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s three remedies oh good you got a</p>
<p>lot out of that question I can tell you</p>
<p>that uh oh this sounds horrible Dr Berg</p>
<p>excuse me DB from Facebook my superior</p>
<p>vena cava is blocked and my face is</p>
<p>swollen help that sounds awful</p>
<p>your vena cava is is blocked that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>serious that&rsquo;s a a vessel a blood vessel</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>I think that would require more medical</p>
<p>help from from someone that can unblock</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I mean maybe you&rsquo;re just talking about</p>
<p>you have some calcium buildup but I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know but um</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s more of a medical kind of</p>
<p>emergency if your major blood vessel is</p>
<p>blocked</p>
<p>yeah I think you might get your wife to</p>
<p>take you on to the hospital with that</p>
<p>one</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see Lucy excuse me</p>
<p>uh oh here we go uh Lucy Anna from</p>
<p>Facebook just adding collagen powder to</p>
<p>my smoothie help my skin</p>
<p>it potentially could</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so it can you know I&rsquo;m kind of mixed</p>
<p>reviews and collagen but on one hand</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s part of an Animal product that I</p>
<p>think we need there&rsquo;s certain</p>
<p>things in there that help especially for</p>
<p>gut lining leaky gut</p>
<p>um I always recommend like eat nose to</p>
<p>tail you know the how the animal protein</p>
<p>how the collagen maybe bone broth as</p>
<p>well as some of the organ Meats uh and</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re safe because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>having this complete</p>
<p>um Neil versus just people just focus on</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>skinless chicken breasts well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just muscle you know I think the skin is</p>
<p>actually as benefit and kind of do here</p>
<p>oh there he goes hang on with the spices</p>
<p>uh so I think those are good okay and Dr</p>
<p>Burke you might want to recap the last</p>
<p>10 seconds he froze up</p>
<p>okay can you hear me now yeah perfectly</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re back</p>
<p>okay so yeah just eat the nose to tail</p>
<p>the whole whole animal and I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be safe okay very good</p>
<p>all right let&rsquo;s go on with another quiz</p>
<p>question and the audience breathes a</p>
<p>great sigh of relief that this one&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>true false they&rsquo;re giving them 50 chance</p>
<p>of being brilliant and there it is Dr</p>
<p>Berg</p>
<p>hypoglycemia okay</p>
<p>is really just High insulin hyper</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>hyper glycemia exactly the audience no</p>
<p>that should be that should that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>incorrect it should be hyper insulinemia</p>
<p>oh so there&rsquo;s a typo there okay my</p>
<p>insulin is hyper insulinium okay so</p>
<p>basically</p>
<p>true or false</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;ll just repeat it um</p>
<p>hypoglycemia is hyperinsulinemia</p>
<p>very good all right let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>back to all our friends on social media</p>
<p>uh and let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>oh here&rsquo;s a good one that we should all</p>
<p>know Olivia from Facebook what are the</p>
<p>healthiest oils to use for cooking</p>
<p>I think I would use the saturated ones I</p>
<p>would use like the um the Tallow or lard</p>
<p>um sometimes I cook with olive oil or</p>
<p>coconut oil</p>
<p>um I don&rsquo;t like to cook with the</p>
<p>vegetable oils which are seed oils at</p>
<p>all</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s pretty much what I cook</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>all right let&rsquo;s see butter butter is</p>
<p>another thing that I cook with as well</p>
<p>all right okay so Darren from Facebook</p>
<p>what are your thoughts on taking red</p>
<p>Marine algae</p>
<p>I think the algae is interesting because</p>
<p>it has</p>
<p>um some really interesting nutrition uh</p>
<p>across the board uh you have red algae</p>
<p>blue-green algae uh which is kind of</p>
<p>like spirulina</p>
<p>um I like it</p>
<p>um I think if you&rsquo;re a vegan it would be</p>
<p>a good source of protein and vitamins</p>
<p>and minerals it pretty much if I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>mistaken it has just about everything</p>
<p>including DHA which is that omega-3</p>
<p>fatty acid I talked about that I forgot</p>
<p>to mention it comes from algae as well</p>
<p>as fish</p>
<p>um so but it&rsquo;s you can&rsquo;t find DHA in any</p>
<p>plant any plants now I will say that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a precursor ala that turns into</p>
<p>DHA then that would be like the flax</p>
<p>seed or walnuts or chia seed but not to</p>
<p>any significant amounts so um</p>
<p>you want to stick with um the animal</p>
<p>meats or products and maybe some algae</p>
<p>okay very good well the audience just</p>
<p>flew through that question and it asked</p>
<p>at least to begin with true false</p>
<p>hyperglycemia is just a high insulin</p>
<p>what was that word doc</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>hypoglycemia low blood sugar is just</p>
<p>hyperinsulinemia hyperinsulinemia well</p>
<p>they have an opinion on that 60 percent</p>
<p>of our respondents say it&rsquo;s true and 40</p>
<p>percent say it is false</p>
<p>you know hypoglycemia you know people</p>
<p>always say oh my blood sugar&rsquo;s a low I</p>
<p>need to go eat right</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>if you just really understand what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the lack of food that&rsquo;s keeping</p>
<p>your blood sugars low</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the lack of sugar</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s eating sugar maybe what you had</p>
<p>yesterday that&rsquo;s created in this problem</p>
<p>because what pushes blood glucose down</p>
<p>is insulin which means if you have</p>
<p>hypoglycemia your insulin is too high</p>
<p>and how do you increase insulin carbs</p>
<p>so that hypoglycemia that low blood</p>
<p>sugar is coming from too many carbs and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s like they try to make it</p>
<p>into some disease this mysterious</p>
<p>disease no it&rsquo;s very simple it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re doing something to raise</p>
<p>your insulin and as soon as you cut the</p>
<p>carbs out that hypoglycemia will go away</p>
<p>I used to have hypoglycemia</p>
<p>um and I I would just have I would have</p>
<p>to eat frequently well the frequent</p>
<p>meals is what creates the problem but</p>
<p>think about medically what they do oh go</p>
<p>eat some candy you know have small</p>
<p>frequent meals to keep your blood sugars</p>
<p>up okay well that&rsquo;s going to work for a</p>
<p>minute until the next day you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>in the same boat so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>yeah I think sugar um</p>
<p>sugar is the culprit to destroying the</p>
<p>mitochondria</p>
<p>Steve have you ever um do you know where</p>
<p>the mitochondria actually comes from</p>
<p>oh I wish I did I&rsquo;d feel smart</p>
<p>just from our from a cellular uh history</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>um what merged between</p>
<p>our cells</p>
<p>in a bacterial cell</p>
<p>is this mitochondria mitochondria has</p>
<p>the origin from a bacteria</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a bacteria that decided to</p>
<p>coexist and uh in our cells and um have</p>
<p>this Arrangement where you know you give</p>
<p>me a place to live and you feed me and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll I&rsquo;ll be your I&rsquo;ll be specialized</p>
<p>into focusing on energy I&rsquo;ll make all</p>
<p>your energy and that&rsquo;s what a</p>
<p>mitochondria is it&rsquo;s a energy Factory</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually it comes from a</p>
<p>bacterial cell and so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>developed to um</p>
<p>be very robust and tough and um</p>
<p>survive through</p>
<p>not eating you know from burning fat you</p>
<p>know like um</p>
<p>from adapting to eating and then</p>
<p>adapting to cold and all sorts of things</p>
<p>because even when you do like cold</p>
<p>therapy you actually get more</p>
<p>mitochondria but I think our</p>
<p>mitochondria has been very very lazy and</p>
<p>recently</p>
<p>in times because</p>
<p>um we we basically feed it</p>
<p>24 7. we um we don&rsquo;t stress it out too</p>
<p>much we don&rsquo;t we&rsquo;re kind of sedentary</p>
<p>uh we like warm temperature we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like the cold the winter and so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotten really lazy and with that comes</p>
<p>all these mitochondrial diseases which</p>
<p>is pretty much like most diseases out</p>
<p>there related to the mitochondria so and</p>
<p>cancer so there&rsquo;s a lot of things you</p>
<p>can do to strengthen the mitochondria</p>
<p>and one thing is not to</p>
<p>to simulate what it&rsquo;s been developed for</p>
<p>I mean just like survival and</p>
<p>not starvation but just fasting cold</p>
<p>therapy more than heat therapy exercise</p>
<p>sunlight all these things are very very</p>
<p>therapeutic to</p>
<p>you know make your mitochondria no</p>
<p>longer so darn lazy</p>
<p>all right very good well Hannah from</p>
<p>Facebook has the nerve to ask is beef</p>
<p>liver the most nutritious food on Earth</p>
<p>I hope not it tastes gross</p>
<p>it probably is</p>
<p>um probably</p>
<p>um up there with other organ Meats</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s more it&rsquo;s so concentrated</p>
<p>with nutrition but you know that being</p>
<p>said</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to overdo it you know if</p>
<p>you have too much liver you can get too</p>
<p>much vitamin A so you want to have some</p>
<p>um but we&rsquo;re not trying to go overboard</p>
<p>like even for example let&rsquo;s take a</p>
<p>selenium</p>
<p>selenium is a very important Trace</p>
<p>mineral that if you&rsquo;re deficient you</p>
<p>have all these problems but if you have</p>
<p>too much you have all these problems so</p>
<p>you can be you can have toxic amounts so</p>
<p>we just need</p>
<p>the right amounts</p>
<p>oh all right let&rsquo;s see um</p>
<p>uh savitha I love Terry always gives me</p>
<p>these sort of phonetically spell things</p>
<p>and thank you Terry because I would have</p>
<p>never pronounced that Savita from</p>
<p>Facebook how can we gain weight on</p>
<p>healthy Keto</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to eat more calories</p>
<p>um a bit more fat and maybe a bit more</p>
<p>carbs but not going past that 50 grams</p>
<p>so bring your carbs up to 50 grams more</p>
<p>protein more fat and then maybe just do</p>
<p>two meals instead of one meal and at</p>
<p>least you&rsquo;ll stop losing weight</p>
<p>all right well by the way I and I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>the audience would love to know how&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your ice bath going did you get that</p>
<p>Gadget</p>
<p>oh yes yes I did and uh</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s quite fascinating because</p>
<p>you know you get the benefits just from</p>
<p>like 11 minutes per week so it sounds</p>
<p>pretty easy doesn&rsquo;t Steve like 11</p>
<p>minutes I can do that well try to try to</p>
<p>soak your body in</p>
<p>37 degree water okay immerse your body</p>
<p>in 37 degrees and see how long you can</p>
<p>tolerate that</p>
<p>um for me it was five seconds I couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>I could not I couldn&rsquo;t go long in that</p>
<p>so I I adjust the temperature up to 50</p>
<p>degrees which is 10 degrees Celsius and</p>
<p>I was able to go a minute</p>
<p>and so I&rsquo;m doing a minute each day which</p>
<p>will give me um seven minutes right per</p>
<p>week and I&rsquo;ll work my way up to two</p>
<p>minutes and then I&rsquo;ll do do that um but</p>
<p>the point is that it&rsquo;s uh you want to do</p>
<p>it so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very uncomfortable</p>
<p>and um even 50 degree</p>
<p>50 degrees is pretty darn uncomfortable</p>
<p>it actually hurts but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fascinating how good you feel after</p>
<p>the pain goes away huh it&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>what does to your sleep cycle and your</p>
<p>energy level I am actually blown away</p>
<p>you know the cold therapy is one thing</p>
<p>that I haven&rsquo;t done a lot of other than</p>
<p>cold showers here and there but I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never been able to get the temperature</p>
<p>um down to the levels to create the</p>
<p>effects so now that I have the tub</p>
<p>um I like it I like it</p>
<p>um my body hates it but I like the</p>
<p>effects that it produces</p>
<p>you know a few minutes after I get out</p>
<p>my goodness but there&rsquo;s some type of</p>
<p>resistance my body just somehow resists</p>
<p>getting in that thing so I have to kind</p>
<p>of just jump in and not think about it</p>
<p>oh yeah that&rsquo;s uh you&rsquo;re Tougher Than Me</p>
<p>Eve you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re next you&rsquo;re next no</p>
<p>actually I do take as cold a shower as</p>
<p>the shower is after a sauna over at the</p>
<p>gym and I do like that and I go back in</p>
<p>you know 190 degrees to whatever winter</p>
<p>water is and I do like that but I</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t go in cold turkey without</p>
<p>getting hot first</p>
<p>I think your mitochondria are just too</p>
<p>darn lazy I bet they are I&rsquo;ll have to</p>
<p>consult them go uh let&rsquo;s see uh pela</p>
<p>from Facebook how can I reduce bad</p>
<p>cholesterol I guess that&rsquo;s LDL right</p>
<p>naturally or is it bad</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two types of bad cholesterol you</p>
<p>have the small particle</p>
<p>like the dense particles and then you</p>
<p>have the large buoyant particle size so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the two I&rsquo;m gonna I guess how do</p>
<p>we reduce the small dense</p>
<p>LDL and that would be reducing carbs and</p>
<p>sugar that&rsquo;s how you do it okay very</p>
<p>good we&rsquo;re gonna go back to the green</p>
<p>room but first let&rsquo;s knock out another</p>
<p>question there you go doc another true</p>
<p>falser</p>
<p>okay egg yolks some have the</p>
<p>have a strong ability to help your liver</p>
<p>detoxify now wait a second egg yolks</p>
<p>is that true or false egg yolks helping</p>
<p>you detoxify</p>
<p>that right climb on that one and while</p>
<p>we oh go I&rsquo;m sorry cholesterol food</p>
<p>all right okay so while you guys ponder</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to go to Steve in</p>
<p>Pasadena but it&rsquo;s not what you think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s Pasadena Arizona so Steve if you</p>
<p>are unmuted I&rsquo;m going to put you on with</p>
<p>Dr Berg for your one question and please</p>
<p>note audience he has a great dog if it</p>
<p>jumps up on him</p>
<p>hello Dr Berg</p>
<p>very nice to meet you and be on the show</p>
<p>this is Mike</p>
<p>Heidi she&rsquo;s my uh</p>
<p>they call her a she&rsquo;s a golden retriever</p>
<p>but they call her an English cream</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the first time it&rsquo;s a mouthful</p>
<p>but uh talking about organ mates she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy on the liver and between you I</p>
<p>have to say between you and Dr Marty</p>
<p>Goldstein a veterinarian I&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>more about nutrition in the past two</p>
<p>years than I&rsquo;ve ever known in my life</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 72 years old I&rsquo;m in great health my</p>
<p>daughter got me this because I was there</p>
<p>anyway originally from Jersey so don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>hold that against me I&rsquo;m in Glendale</p>
<p>Arizona love it my one issue doctor I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>healthier than a horse but early in the</p>
<p>morning I gotta go I gotta pee and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like non-negotiable I gotta go and I</p>
<p>followed your advice I put the snacks I</p>
<p>go to bed around 10 10 30. I quit the</p>
<p>snacks or whatever I don&rsquo;t really snack</p>
<p>but I quit you know I quit eating and</p>
<p>drinking anything around 7 7 30 and go</p>
<p>to bed around 10 30 or so and still</p>
<p>early in the morning it&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>better but early in the morning it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like hello</p>
<p>I gotta go I gotta pee and then it&rsquo;s two</p>
<p>or three times Within</p>
<p>an hour hour and a half somewhere around</p>
<p>there but I have a strong stream</p>
<p>so at first I thought it was what all</p>
<p>older guys kind of get with their</p>
<p>prostate I don&rsquo;t think it is but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the man</p>
<p>when I talk about this I talk about it</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s really related to insulin</p>
<p>resistance and that if you have insulin</p>
<p>resistance by snacking too much eating</p>
<p>carbs you&rsquo;re gonna you&rsquo;re gonna get up a</p>
<p>lot at night</p>
<p>um yeah you&rsquo;re getting up early which uh</p>
<p>we can always improve that</p>
<p>um but on the flip side</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s others there&rsquo;s sense there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sensors receptors in your bladder for</p>
<p>concentration of urine too I have my</p>
<p>gallbladder removed doctor</p>
<p>right I&rsquo;m talking about your urinary</p>
<p>bladder okay</p>
<p>so in the urinary blood there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>receptors for concentration of urine so</p>
<p>the more concentrated your urine is the</p>
<p>more you gotta go</p>
<p>um so</p>
<p>um you may want to during the day</p>
<p>actually increase</p>
<p>your volume of fluid so you&rsquo;ll be less</p>
<p>concentrated at night and that might</p>
<p>take you a little bit further the other</p>
<p>thing that I think might be interesting</p>
<p>for you if you try that methylene blue</p>
<p>uh watch the video on that because the</p>
<p>methylene blue is uh it uh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fantastic for all these little</p>
<p>problems that you&rsquo;re trying to resolve</p>
<p>that taking it too long like right</p>
<p>insulin resistance you know and all</p>
<p>sorts of things so I did a video on that</p>
<p>too but</p>
<p>um that that&rsquo;s what I would recommend</p>
<p>and of course</p>
<p>um if the stream wasn&rsquo;t that great I</p>
<p>would think okay so</p>
<p>um prostate so you&rsquo;d probably need to</p>
<p>avoid Dairy but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your problem I think that insulin</p>
<p>resistance is a tough nut to crack it</p>
<p>takes a long time and sometimes</p>
<p>um fasting longer will speed it up out</p>
<p>of the apple cider vinegar the berberine</p>
<p>all these things to speed it up but I</p>
<p>think</p>
<p>based on what you told me about that</p>
<p>um try that and then also keep working</p>
<p>at it</p>
<p>um trying to get rid of instant</p>
<p>resistance over a period of time and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it just could take more time okay</p>
<p>well Steve by the way we&rsquo;re out of time</p>
<p>now but I sure appreciate you coming on</p>
<p>and yeah sharing with us your let&rsquo;s give</p>
<p>them one more look your lovely dog so</p>
<p>thanks so much for in bringing us that</p>
<p>joyous Visage you&rsquo;re welcome and my my</p>
<p>wife was actually born in New Jersey so</p>
<p>uh I have a lot of</p>
<p>oh yeah</p>
<p>um I don&rsquo;t know where she was born but</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>yeah all right well let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>on to uh second to last quiz question Dr</p>
<p>Berg</p>
<p>here it is</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>um did you get the answer to this</p>
<p>question excuse me there we go I got</p>
<p>distracted I&rsquo;m sure I</p>
<p>I did uh Terry do I see it there oh yes</p>
<p>yes we did I&rsquo;m forgive me so the</p>
<p>question was true false eggs have a</p>
<p>strong ability to help your liver</p>
<p>detoxify and the audience was on it with</p>
<p>their question with 90 say it&rsquo;s true 10</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s false</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s always a skeptic in the room but</p>
<p>yes that&rsquo;s totally true because the egg</p>
<p>yolks are high in Sulfur which is what</p>
<p>your liver needs to detox you got this</p>
<p>interesting phase one phase two</p>
<p>detoxification system in your in your</p>
<p>liver in fact they&rsquo;re in a lot of other</p>
<p>parts of your body too but um and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the whole goal is to take poisons which</p>
<p>are mostly that soluble to turn them</p>
<p>into water-soluble particles and then so</p>
<p>you can exit these poisons so</p>
<p>um what foods are high in Sulfur what</p>
<p>what foods are high in the complete</p>
<p>amino acids that these detoxification</p>
<p>enzymes need</p>
<p>um or built out of</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>like methionine and and cysteine and all</p>
<p>these other ones well guess what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>very high in the egg yolk so egg yolk</p>
<p>has quite a few things that can help you</p>
<p>help your liver detox you would think</p>
<p>that it wouldn&rsquo;t do it because it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>oh this fatty food but no you you egg</p>
<p>yolks are one of the best things in many</p>
<p>different levels but definitely</p>
<p>increasing the ability to detox now if</p>
<p>you took those eggs</p>
<p>and you fried them in</p>
<p>um olive oil</p>
<p>or butter with garlic and onion and</p>
<p>maybe put some roasted brussels sprouts</p>
<p>uh now you have a really interesting</p>
<p>liver detox</p>
<p>um because now you got the the help from</p>
<p>the Allison and the garlic and the</p>
<p>quercetin from the onion and all the</p>
<p>other great phytonutrients in the</p>
<p>cruciferous so that would be the best</p>
<p>meal to support your liver</p>
<p>detoxification you know people always do</p>
<p>these two-week detox cleanses</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re wasting your time</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>the amount of</p>
<p>poisons you&rsquo;re going to pull out in two</p>
<p>weeks it&rsquo;s not going to really make a</p>
<p>difference what you should do is just</p>
<p>get your diet really squared away so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re consistently stimulating these</p>
<p>phase one phase two detoxification</p>
<p>enzymes and</p>
<p>you know broccoli Sprouts or grow them</p>
<p>yourself like micro greens and</p>
<p>vegetables and and high quality eggs and</p>
<p>things like that can can be much better</p>
<p>in the long run to keep these poisons</p>
<p>out of your body</p>
<p>all right very good let&rsquo;s uh show the</p>
<p>audience the final question this one not</p>
<p>a true falser and there it is okay which</p>
<p>one of these three trace minerals has</p>
<p>the ability to reverse alopecia which is</p>
<p>like these hair loss and little clumps</p>
<p>zinc iodine or selenium</p>
<p>all right I trust the audience will know</p>
<p>the answer that let&rsquo;s go back to our</p>
<p>final contestant if you will in the</p>
<p>green room and this time it is lovely</p>
<p>Crystal from uh Wisconsin I think you</p>
<p>spent some time there didn&rsquo;t you doc</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s where I was I came from kind</p>
<p>of ocean Wisconsin I don&rsquo;t know where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from Crystal I&rsquo;m from Menominee</p>
<p>okay okay so you&rsquo;re in the north part</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m uh yeah well middle middle West</p>
<p>Middle yeah close to the Twin Cities</p>
<p>okay yeah okay great so yeah my parents</p>
<p>are in Eagle River so uh oh sure um just</p>
<p>went to a hockey tournament there oh wow</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great yeah</p>
<p>so my question what would you tell</p>
<p>somebody that has very high hormone</p>
<p>levels like estrogen all the androgens</p>
<p>are high testosterone is high cortisol</p>
<p>is high I&rsquo;ve read some conflicting</p>
<p>studies with fasting and how sometimes</p>
<p>they can make those antigens worse</p>
<p>how would you how would you take on</p>
<p>fasting with that</p>
<p>well fasting</p>
<p>actually affects every single one of</p>
<p>those hormones we just take a look at</p>
<p>androgens for example what stimulates</p>
<p>androgens like in polycystic ovarian</p>
<p>syndrome that would be carbs and</p>
<p>frequent eating so if you go in fasting</p>
<p>you actually can reverse that now</p>
<p>estrogen is a little different</p>
<p>if someone has an estrogen excess</p>
<p>either their liver is kind of messed up</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re very deficient in iodine</p>
<p>which it helps to regulate the amount of</p>
<p>estrogen in your body and if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>deficient of that you end up with a like</p>
<p>cysts and the ovaries or fibrocystic</p>
<p>breast issues things like that and then</p>
<p>of course High insulin comes from carbs</p>
<p>and then</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I think you we already talked about</p>
<p>androgens or testosterone and there was</p>
<p>a was there another hormone or is that</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>very high DHEA too which I I think is</p>
<p>odd because usually women once they get</p>
<p>closer to you know menopause it it</p>
<p>trickles away but I mean really high</p>
<p>well DHEA is um see what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>describing is all the sex all the sex</p>
<p>hormones okay and these sex hormones um</p>
<p>are include cortisol which is a stress</p>
<p>hormone too and so um the the precursor</p>
<p>the building block is DHEA so</p>
<p>this person is probably just</p>
<p>experiencing more stress and more</p>
<p>requirement to make some of these</p>
<p>hormones and so I think the stress might</p>
<p>be driving all these hormones at higher</p>
<p>levels</p>
<p>um so what I would do I would of course</p>
<p>reduce carbs and actually increase more</p>
<p>cholesterol foods which is going to help</p>
<p>make it easier for your body to or</p>
<p>whoever this is to um balance things out</p>
<p>um but but if you&rsquo;re doing higher fats</p>
<p>make sure at the same time you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>increase your carbs so you go low carb</p>
<p>and then we do higher fats and with good</p>
<p>cholesterol like butter things like that</p>
<p>and and by the way if you do a really</p>
<p>good quality butter especially if it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>postmen possible female you also get a</p>
<p>lot of vitamin E good vitamin A you get</p>
<p>vitamin K2 so there&rsquo;s a lot of benefits</p>
<p>in that as well</p>
<p>awesome thank you you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>enjoy the nice warm weather that you</p>
<p>just came through the cold weather so I</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s really cold I think I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>waiting for one more snow</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>I remember taking my battery in at night</p>
<p>because it would freeze and uh yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty darn cold</p>
<p>thanks for a great call Crystal and uh I</p>
<p>hope you don&rsquo;t have another snow it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>time for summer for goodness sakes</p>
<p>anyway let&rsquo;s answer our final question</p>
<p>of the day uh which asks which of these</p>
<p>three trace minerals has the ability to</p>
<p>reverse alopecia</p>
<p>zinc iodine or selenium and the audience</p>
<p>does have an opinion 65 percent of our</p>
<p>respondents say zinc 30 say is selenium</p>
<p>and five percent are holding out for</p>
<p>iodine any winners</p>
<p>this is another this is a trick question</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically all three</p>
<p>um but I will say zinc is probably the</p>
<p>most</p>
<p>researched but you can don&rsquo;t mind this</p>
<p>background uh sound it&rsquo;s uh a dog in the</p>
<p>background but uh yeah all three which</p>
<p>is pretty cool selenium iodine and zinc</p>
<p>is an essential common um</p>
<p>Trio that you definitely need if you</p>
<p>have hair loss especially alopecia</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>for for two reasons one is that these</p>
<p>trace minerals help build</p>
<p>um proteins in your hairs of protein</p>
<p>directly and also they are intimately</p>
<p>involved in your immune system so if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re deficient in any one of these</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re more susceptible to this</p>
<p>autoimmune alopecia which is that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>exactly what it is so it can actually</p>
<p>help um</p>
<p>build up um your immune system and</p>
<p>protect you against</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>not just alopecia but other conditions</p>
<p>that can cause alopecia or related like</p>
<p>Hashimoto&rsquo;s lupus things like that so</p>
<p>anyway those are the three minerals that</p>
<p>are very important in focusing in on and</p>
<p>just as one side note about iodine you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s hard to get iodine but</p>
<p>um one way what happens when you</p>
<p>increase fluoride is you block iodine so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another hidden</p>
<p>source of iodine deficiency and you</p>
<p>might say well</p>
<p>you know I have Spring Water I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>getting it from the water I don&rsquo;t do the</p>
<p>teeth whitening things but what about</p>
<p>medication 20 of medications including</p>
<p>statins and Prozac antibiotics and</p>
<p>anti-inflammatories are based around</p>
<p>this fluoride</p>
<p>which apparently can interrupt your</p>
<p>ability to absorb iodine</p>
<p>which does a has a Cascade of effect</p>
<p>Cascade effects so</p>
<p>um just wanted to bring that up as a as</p>
<p>a side note Steve very good well we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got some feedback from the audience TT</p>
<p>from Facebook whole body cryotherapy</p>
<p>changed my life chronic pain went away</p>
<p>Vision immediately improved in my sleep</p>
<p>improved dramatically go all the way Dr</p>
<p>Burke so they&rsquo;re cheering you on turn</p>
<p>that thermostat down says TT</p>
<p>so I hope that&rsquo;s good you know if you do</p>
<p>uh jacuzzi boy that&rsquo;s so comfortable</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>but this cold therapy bath cold water</p>
<p>immersion is</p>
<p>the opposite it&rsquo;s very uncomfortable so</p>
<p>you know it must be good for you right</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s uh epigenetically we our bodies</p>
<p>were developed</p>
<p>um during stress in times of winter we</p>
<p>had to survive winter and so the cold</p>
<p>starvation which is fasting if we if we</p>
<p>just kind of like can mimic what our</p>
<p>bodies were designed to</p>
<p>adapt to our survival actually does</p>
<p>better our cells actually</p>
<p>you know start</p>
<p>aligning up and they start surviving</p>
<p>better so a lot of health problems go</p>
<p>away when you start just getting more</p>
<p>sun</p>
<p>not eating so frequently</p>
<p>um versus the other ways of being warm</p>
<p>all the time eating constantly and</p>
<p>staying inside and being sanitary so I</p>
<p>mean that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the Simplicity of</p>
<p>what you could do to get healthy is just</p>
<p>to kind of align your body what with</p>
<p>what it was designed to</p>
<p>um develop from</p>
<p>other nature that&rsquo;s incredible by the</p>
<p>way I remember Alcatraz the um the</p>
<p>prison surrounded by chilly water in San</p>
<p>Francisco they kept the water warm uh</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t have cold water so that the</p>
<p>prisoners wouldn&rsquo;t get accustomed to it</p>
<p>which would help coordinating their</p>
<p>escape so they all got warm showers but</p>
<p>dare not Escape so that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>well I&rsquo;ll just tell you 37 degrees I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if some people can do that</p>
<p>um that is</p>
<p>extremely cold and um</p>
<p>five seconds maybe maybe every time I</p>
<p>can adapt to it but I&rsquo;m going to keep</p>
<p>trying I&rsquo;ll keep you updated thank you</p>
<p>so much for the wonderful questions and</p>
<p>you from sticking around this long</p>
<p>um uh stay tuned for some more</p>
<p>interesting videos that I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>share this next week</p>
