    <ul>
<li>Good afternoon everybody.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m Anne Harrison.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the dean of the Haas School of Business.</p>
<p>Welcome to today&rsquo;s Dean Speaker series co-sponsored</p>
<p>by our MBA Student club,</p>
<p>Q at Haas.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<p>So I am really delighted to introduce today&rsquo;s speaker,</p>
<p>Jen Wong,</p>
<p>who is the Chief Operating Officer of Reddit.</p>
<p>In her role since 2018,</p>
<p>she oversees business strategy and related teams.</p>
<p>Jen has been instrumental in transforming Reddit,</p>
<p>through increasing its user base,</p>
<p>which now has reached revenues of over a hundred million.</p>
<p>She has also played a leadership role</p>
<p>in Reddit&rsquo;s effort to deepen online communities.</p>
<p>Jen has over 15 years of industry experience</p>
<p>in digital media spaces,</p>
<p>most recently working as Chief Operating Officer</p>
<p>and president of Digital at Time Inc.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s also held leadership roles in business operations</p>
<p>at POPSUGAR and AOL.</p>
<p>Jen earned her MBA from Harvard Business School.</p>
<p>She has an MS in Engineering Economic Systems and Operations</p>
<p>from Stanford.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll forgive you for that, Jen.</p>
<p>And she has a BS in Applied Mathematics</p>
<p>from Yale University.</p>
<p>Her recognitions include being named number four</p>
<p>on Fast Companies Square 50,</p>
<p>and on Gold House&rsquo;s a 100 list,</p>
<p>that honors the most impactful Asians and Asian American</p>
<p>and Pacific Islanders in culture.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, Jen,</p>
<p>for taking the time out of your busy schedule.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re honored and grateful to have you join us today</p>
<p>and especially as we celebrate coming out week at Haas.</p>
<p>Woo.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you so much Dean Harrison,</li>
</ul>
<p>it&rsquo;s really my honor to be here and be invited.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh, you&rsquo;re so welcome.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I&rsquo;m now going to turn it over to Erin Brock,</p>
<p>who will tell us about Q at Haas</p>
<p>and coming out week activities.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<ul>
<li>Hello,</li>
</ul>
<p>my name is Erin Brock and I am the VP of coming out week</p>
<p>for Q at Haas.</p>
<p>Q at Haas was founded over 30 years ago now,</p>
<p>by four Haas&rsquo;s who wanted to create a safe space,</p>
<p>to experience their business school,</p>
<p>experience,</p>
<p>amongst fellow L G B T plus classmates,</p>
<p>as well as to develop queer leadership in the workplace,</p>
<p>and draw in the larger Haas community</p>
<p>into this conversation.</p>
<p>We are celebrating coming out week,</p>
<p>this week as a larger celebration of L G B T communities.</p>
<p>We also recognize that coming out is an incredibly personal</p>
<p>and unique process for every queer individual.</p>
<p>Some people may never come out,</p>
<p>some people will may be considering coming out,</p>
<p>some people may have been out since they were four</p>
<p>or five years old.</p>
<p>We wanna reiterate that all those experiences are valid,</p>
<p>and our role here on this campus is to create a safe space</p>
<p>for the full spectrum of L G B T plus identities</p>
<p>that are here,</p>
<p>and the different stages that people may be in</p>
<p>within their coming out journey.</p>
<p>We are really excited to be able to bring,</p>
<p>more LGBT leadership from companies like Reddit</p>
<p>and Jen&rsquo;s leadership to campus,</p>
<p>and be able to lead this conversation</p>
<p>around what it means to be an ally and a queer leader</p>
<p>in our modern business world.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you, Erin.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you Jen for joining us,</p>
<p>and thank you to everyone in the audience for joining us</p>
<p>this afternoon and spending some of your time with us</p>
<p>for what is going to be a really great conversation.</p>
<p>My name is Via Valencia.</p>
<p>My pronouns are they them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of the co-presidents of Q at Haas</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll be moderating along with-</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m Jona,</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of the other co-presidents of Q at Haas</p>
<p>and my pronouns are she her.</p>
<ul>
<li>Great, so Jen,</li>
</ul>
<p>Dean Anne Harrison shared a long line of accomplishments</p>
<p>in her introduction to you,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m really hoping that you can fill in the gaps</p>
<p>in transitions for us.</p>
<p>So can you share your leadership journey,</p>
<p>and what were your steps in deciding where, when,</p>
<p>and how to take boulder steps in your career,</p>
<p>so that you can get to the point that you are now?</p>
<ul>
<li>You know, it&rsquo;s interesting.</li>
</ul>
<p>I never thought of myself as a leader,</p>
<p>certainly growing up and for large parts of my career.</p>
<p>I think growing up,</p>
<p>I just assumed a leader was like a person who told</p>
<p>other people what to do.</p>
<p>And I think for people who knew me when I was younger,</p>
<p>they probably would maybe be surprised at what I do today</p>
<p>because I was very introverted, very shy,</p>
<p>and I was actually scared of talking in front</p>
<p>of people still, you know,</p>
<p>cause a little stress for me.</p>
<p>But over time, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say I really began to appreciate companies</p>
<p>and then appreciate the amazing things that they do</p>
<p>which is, you know,</p>
<p>make goods and services that people can use,</p>
<p>like millions of people,</p>
<p>and support the livelihoods of a lot of people.</p>
<p>And I became really interested</p>
<p>in the people who ran those companies</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time just reading about it.</p>
<p>You know,</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;ve made changes in my career,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s usually driven by a couple of things</p>
<p>and I generally like to say hopefully I&rsquo;m moving towards</p>
<p>something really positive although sometimes,</p>
<p>admittedly I need a little kick in the pants</p>
<p>which is feeling maybe a little bit</p>
<p>like I need a new prompt to solve.</p>
<p>So the first is usually I look for something that&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>really interesting problem,</p>
<p>something that where I can learn,</p>
<p>and that really usually propels me.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a puzzler at heart and I,</p>
<p>I love like, new problems.</p>
<p>So when my mind starts searching for a new problem,</p>
<p>that gets me excited about what the next opportunity is,</p>
<p>especially when I&rsquo;ve like fixed a problem at a place</p>
<p>or a puzzle I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ve like maybe finished the end of this journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second is,</p>
<p>for me and I think each of you will figure this out,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really attracted to consumer,</p>
<p>kind of Zeitgeist businesses.</p>
<p>I love pop culture,</p>
<p>I fiddle with new apps all the time,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what I enjoy.</p>
<p>And so, you know,</p>
<p>anytime I&rsquo;ve made a move,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always stayed in the area of consumer businesses</p>
<p>because I feel like it resonates with my personal intuition</p>
<p>about the product,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>And I think that helps me do better in terms of my work.</p>
<p>The third is I think,</p>
<p>I always try to move towards something</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s a very clear lane for me to have impact.</p>
<p>I think Reddit was a great example of this.</p>
<p>Reddit was, you know,</p>
<p>when I joined in 2018,</p>
<p>was over a decade old but didn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and very large in terms of user base,</p>
<p>but had no business model,</p>
<p>and I love building businesses and that just felt</p>
<p>like a magical match and runway to have impact.</p>
<p>So I look for that kind of runway.</p>
<p>And then the final thing is always great people.</p>
<p>I mean you work with, you know,</p>
<p>you spend so many hours with folks and it&rsquo;s everything</p>
<p>on a day to day basis.</p>
<p>So, you know,</p>
<p>if I reflect on the moves that I&rsquo;ve made,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s often been driven by,</p>
<p>wow there&rsquo;s an amazing person and then there&rsquo;s this runway</p>
<p>or opportunity,</p>
<p>or wow this is an amazing product I&rsquo;m really excited about.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this runway.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s some combination of the things that I mentioned</p>
<p>before where I said, okay,</p>
<p>this feels like something really significant and exciting.</p>
<ul>
<li>That&rsquo;s great, thank you for that.</li>
</ul>
<p>It sounds like you&rsquo;re really self aware</p>
<p>in where you can really play and put your skills to test,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re also pushing the envelope in terms</p>
<p>of growth so that you can seek new opportunities</p>
<p>and slowly build up.</p>
<p>It sounds like the skills of someone with an MBA.</p>
<p>So you received your MBA from a school on the East Coast,</p>
<p>and much of the audience here today are first</p>
<p>and second year MBA students who are</p>
<p>about to make big decisions in their personal lives</p>
<p>and their careers and what they want for themselves.</p>
<p>So what advice do you have for us to navigate this point</p>
<p>in our lives?</p>
<ul>
<li>I envy all of you.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was one of the best experiences of my career and life.</p>
<p>So enjoy all of it, I would say,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an incredible opportunity to take some risks</p>
<p>and try something new.</p>
<p>I tried starting a business,</p>
<p>which I was curious about,</p>
<p>and I realized I think starting business is actually</p>
<p>not for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very entrepreneurial,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not that interested, I think,</p>
<p>in being an entrepreneur in terms of the zero to 10 phase</p>
<p>of a company.</p>
<p>But I learned that by just trying it when I was,</p>
<p>when I was in school.</p>
<p>The other thing I&rsquo;ll say is, you know,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s is pressure to feel like, okay,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m leaving business school,</p>
<p>I wanna make like the perfect choice for me,</p>
<p>as if that&rsquo;s the roller job you&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>and set the course for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>And it really isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>What I often say is just find a direction that makes sense</p>
<p>and start from there and you&rsquo;ll feel your way through it</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get to where you wanna be.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s been true for me.</p>
<p>And just take some of the pressure off</p>
<p>of having the next decision be absolutely perfect,</p>
<p>because you can kind of torture yourself with that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a great time for reflection, you know,</p>
<p>which will help you do better at that decision,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be perfect.</p>
<p>And then the final thing is just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a great opportunity to make lifelong friends,</p>
<p>who are truly gonna help you,</p>
<p>I think be great friends to you,</p>
<p>but also will help,</p>
<p>will help you be a more successful leader later.</p>
<p>You know, most jobs in the world I think are</p>
<p>from people you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not from recruiters.</p>
<p>I call people all the time for advice,</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t work in my industry,</p>
<p>but who&rsquo;s judgment I trust.</p>
<p>When I went to business school,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have a network of queer business leaders.</p>
<p>And that was awesome to have,</p>
<p>and to see how, you know,</p>
<p>people navigated the workplace with different ranges</p>
<p>of coming out and different situations and you know,</p>
<p>dealing with some indignities.</p>
<p>Like it was just really helpful to have that network</p>
<p>and you know, I think the most valuable part</p>
<p>for me turned out I think was definitely the people</p>
<p>and the time and the space to take some risks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you for that.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think we all definitely in this room feel the pressure</p>
<p>of making perfect decisions.</p>
<p>So your advice around that is really helpful</p>
<p>and we will make sure we take it to heart.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s some of the advice that we should take.</p>
<p>What is some of the advice that we should definitely ignore?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve gotten a lot of advice that I ignored.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I remember somebody said to me,</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have a really, really strong point of view</p>
<p>within the first week of your new job</p>
<p>otherwise people won&rsquo;t respect you</p>
<p>or think that you know what you&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was like, okay,</p>
<p>I think that sounds like a recipe</p>
<p>for probably not making friends.</p>
<p>And I saw other people kind of behave that way</p>
<p>and I was like okay, that&rsquo;s not good advice.</p>
<p>I think the second one is I felt a lot of pressure to go</p>
<p>through the recruiting cycle and get a job</p>
<p>for next September in September a year before,</p>
<p>or January the year before.</p>
<p>And there are so many,</p>
<p>and I felt that way about internships too.</p>
<p>And I would just say there are so many opportunities,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all different and you can get a job when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>about to graduate or at the end of your first year,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>in a what I call a logical cycle versus,</p>
<p>you know, the annual cycle.</p>
<p>And so just again,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t be scared to do that</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s the right thing for you.</p>
<p>And, you know,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t feel subject to like the pressure of like,</p>
<p>sort of the cycles of recruiting.</p>
<p>I think you know,</p>
<p>I think a lot of people find a lot</p>
<p>of interesting things that are not in the, you know,</p>
<p>sort of standard cycle.</p>
<ul>
<li>Great, thank you for that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Transitioning into a different topic a little bit</p>
<p>about just interpersonal dynamics,</p>
<p>organizational dynamics.</p>
<p>So it said that Reddit is the most human place on earth,</p>
<p>on the internet,</p>
<p>where trust and authenticity can be found</p>
<p>within sub Reddits,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not typically found in other online communities.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m curious about your thoughts about what is it</p>
<p>about Reddit that&rsquo;s made the online culture manifest</p>
<p>in this way,</p>
<p>and have you ever tried to embed these lessons</p>
<p>into how you lead Reddit as an organization?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a great question.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do believe Reddit is the most human place on the internet.</p>
<p>And actually one of our platform values is, you know,</p>
<p>remember the human,</p>
<p>because Reddit is,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s a technology company,</p>
<p>but it is really powered by humans.</p>
<p>And everything on Reddit is driven by the creativity,</p>
<p>the passion, the generosity of users and moderators.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re on the platform,</p>
<p>and the platform,</p>
<p>the values on the platform are totally reflected</p>
<p>in the company.</p>
<p>So for example,</p>
<p>our communities really value open expression and discussion.</p>
<p>They value transparency, they value authenticity,</p>
<p>they value privacy.</p>
<p>And these are all things that as a company,</p>
<p>we also reflect in everything we do.</p>
<p>We built an advertising business,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s different than that of our peers.</p>
<p>It deeply respects privacy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been able to build a business in harmony</p>
<p>with our values,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re very thoughtful about that.</p>
<p>The neutrality,</p>
<p>something we believe in won&rsquo;t violate that for our business.</p>
<p>So, you know,</p>
<p>I think we have a,</p>
<p>one of the things I love about working at Reddit</p>
<p>and what I love about Reddit the platform,</p>
<p>is that I think it is a very,</p>
<p>very valued driven both company and platform.</p>
<p>And that I think is such a clear North star</p>
<p>in helping to make the right decisions,</p>
<p>that I think has sustained the business for, you know,</p>
<p>17 years at this point.</p>
<p>And I think that that allows us, you know,</p>
<p>you always make mistakes along the way,</p>
<p>but for the most part we have these guiding principles</p>
<p>that allow us to really make sure that we&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>in line with our community,</p>
<p>who we treat as equal partners in everything we do.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very, very different than a lot of companies.</p>
<p>Like we have a living animate set of people,</p>
<p>who we consult on product and things that we do</p>
<p>because we value their perspective so much.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty uncommon and pretty unusual,</p>
<p>but it is wow end to the way we work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Interesting.</li>
</ul>
<p>That kind of leads us to my next question which is,</p>
<p>this year in the last few years,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve definitely seen an increased scrutiny</p>
<p>on social media platforms with respect to hate speech.</p>
<p>How do you think about balancing free speech</p>
<p>and harmful content and what key decisions have you taken</p>
<p>that has successfully worked for Reddit through the years?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I mean look,</li>
</ul>
<p>health and safety of the platform are incredibly important</p>
<p>to open expression, right?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not safe, you can&rsquo;t have that open discussion.</p>
<p>And our mission is to bring community belonging</p>
<p>and empowerment to everyone in the world.</p>
<p>And that means we have to build,</p>
<p>we have to help our users build communities that reflect</p>
<p>these values and respect civil discourse</p>
<p>and human dignity in order to allow</p>
<p>these conversations to happen.</p>
<p>So, you know,</p>
<p>over the years we&rsquo;ve developed policies and made decisions,</p>
<p>that try to make clear what&rsquo;s allowed and not allowed</p>
<p>on our platform.</p>
<p>And every platform handles moderation differently.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very, very different,</p>
<p>for those who use Reddit you may know,</p>
<p>it may not be obvious, you know,</p>
<p>but we have these layers.</p>
<p>So obviously we have policies,</p>
<p>most of our peers have site wide policies that we enforce.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s different about Reddit is we have signals</p>
<p>from our community up and down,</p>
<p>and down is really valuable</p>
<p>because it tells you if something is offending people</p>
<p>or wrong or deemed unsavory,</p>
<p>and it sinks it in terms of its visibility</p>
<p>and everybody gets a vote and you don&rsquo;t get any,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have a follower driven model.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no equity that makes a single post boosted</p>
<p>above anybody else&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It simply votes.</p>
<p>It starts at zero and you either go up or down.</p>
<p>So the idea sinks or swims on itself,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter who wrote it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very different.</p>
<p>And then on top of it,</p>
<p>we have a volunteer group of moderators who get, you know,</p>
<p>help communities write their own rules that sit</p>
<p>on top of our rules.</p>
<p>And they are our partners in moderating all the communities.</p>
<p>So very, very different than our peers.</p>
<p>I think very scalable and very good at handling nuance</p>
<p>so that communities can handle the conversations</p>
<p>and the language the way that makes sense for them, right?</p>
<p>So not a one size fits all,</p>
<p>like manual for the pizza community, the news community,</p>
<p>the Ukraine community.</p>
<p>Like everybody gets to set their rules up</p>
<p>for what works for them.</p>
<p>This has worked for us, you know,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;d say is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s worked for us,</p>
<p>we can always do better,</p>
<p>but overall I think this has been scaling really,</p>
<p>really well.</p>
<p>It is one of the toughest problems out there</p>
<p>to balance these new things due to the toughest decisions</p>
<p>that we make,</p>
<p>but the good news is we make them in concert</p>
<p>with our community.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I&rsquo;d really like to expand on this idea</li>
</ul>
<p>of adaptive leadership and reading the signals that you get</p>
<p>from the Reddit community,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s positive or negative.</p>
<p>So here at Haas one of our values</p>
<p>and one of our defining leadership principles</p>
<p>is to question the status quo.</p>
<p>So when making executive level decisions,</p>
<p>how do you bridge or balance tactical decision making that</p>
<p>can be used or made using a logical framework,</p>
<p>with more creativity?</p>
<p>Which is,</p>
<p>I think is something that ties into your last response,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m curious if you can dig</p>
<p>into that a little bit deeper for us.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a great question.</li>
</ul>
<p>I can speak from my reference point, which is I think,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m both an intuitive person</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m very fact based</p>
<p>and for me it&rsquo;s very hard to go against my gut.</p>
<p>It is extremely uncomfortable.</p>
<p>So when the two don&rsquo;t match,</p>
<p>it is really, really difficult and I gotta sleep on it,</p>
<p>and I really have to understand why the two are in conflict.</p>
<p>What I find is that when you&rsquo;re in a situation,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re growing and building something,</p>
<p>like a new company,</p>
<p>a new product, things are always big.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re ill defined.</p>
<p>Strategy is more often than not ill defined.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where I think experience</p>
<p>and intuition are important to have conviction to move</p>
<p>through a situation where there&rsquo;s no data, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re building something</p>
<p>and imagining something that didn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>In other decisions,</p>
<p>you can be more fact based because it&rsquo;s more defined,</p>
<p>sometimes, you know,</p>
<p>defined investments in let&rsquo;s say a piece of technology</p>
<p>or a factory, et cetera,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very different that it may somewhat more</p>
<p>computational and more fact based.</p>
<p>You might lean on that versus intuition.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;d say is, you know, in all cases,</p>
<p>I really believe in operating from first principles.</p>
<p>And so for example,</p>
<p>at Reddit we start with our values and what&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>for Reddit and based on the values,</p>
<p>what are the decisions that we would make.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very scalable way to propagate,</p>
<p>a way of thinking to a lot of people who have, you know,</p>
<p>now almost 2000 people who have to make decisions</p>
<p>about product and our business.</p>
<p>I find that when having first principles,</p>
<p>what happens is everybody has clarity</p>
<p>on what the right decision is for the most part.</p>
<p>And you can scale and you aren&rsquo;t swayed</p>
<p>by immediate tactical,</p>
<p>emotional kind of exogenous variables</p>
<p>because you have a clear sense of,</p>
<p>at the core what your North star is and how this decision</p>
<p>or principle or value will tie to your North star.</p>
<ul>
<li>Very interesting.</li>
</ul>
<p>I definitely like,</p>
<p>I have read a lot about first principles decision model and</p>
<p>like decision making,</p>
<p>and I think that even applies to life,</p>
<p>how you, you know,</p>
<p>think through big decisions in your life.</p>
<p>That kind of goes to my next question.</p>
<p>Reddit&rsquo;s ad revenue, as we heard,</p>
<p>has grown to over a hundred million dollars,</p>
<p>and Reddit compared to other social media platforms</p>
<p>has weathered the pandemic really well,</p>
<p>some of them,</p>
<p>some of the others have seen a decline</p>
<p>in user base recently.</p>
<p>So I was curious to know,</p>
<p>what decisions do you think have helped Reddit&rsquo;s success</p>
<p>in the past few years?</p>
<p>And as a digital marketing media,</p>
<p>expert yourself,</p>
<p>how do you see the interaction between users</p>
<p>and online communities changing in the future?</p>
<p>And as in addition to that,</p>
<p>one last question is,</p>
<p>what keeps you up at night with regard to that</p>
<p>in the future?</p>
<ul>
<li>Okay, let me take them one by one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good questions.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Decisions that have helped Reddit success.</p>
<p>One is the one we just talked about.</p>
<p>I think being very clear about our values,</p>
<p>which by the way,</p>
<p>we had but we didn&rsquo;t codify.</p>
<p>So we actually went through the process of codifying</p>
<p>our values and writing sets of principles,</p>
<p>both internal ones, leadership principles,</p>
<p>privacy principles, you know,</p>
<p>enhancing our values down to a more usable, you know,</p>
<p>set of a guidance.</p>
<p>So clarifying our values and our stance on things like,</p>
<p>privacy principles.</p>
<p>I think from a first principal&rsquo;s perspective,</p>
<p>has really helped us scale</p>
<p>and define some of the strategies.</p>
<p>Number two,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t have a business when we joined.</p>
<p>We had to decide on a business model.</p>
<p>Our decision was to build an advertising business first.</p>
<p>We do have an aspiration for,</p>
<p>a consumer driven model.</p>
<p>Ad businesses are scalable, they&rsquo;re fast,</p>
<p>and we built it in harmony with our platform,</p>
<p>and our values.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s worked really well for us</p>
<p>because I do think in, you know,</p>
<p>in the world of digital marketing,</p>
<p>people do care about privacy,</p>
<p>they care about performance,</p>
<p>but they also care about privacy.</p>
<p>They care about who they&rsquo;re working with, et cetera.</p>
<p>And so that I think has done really well for us.</p>
<p>We have a really differentiated kind of proposition.</p>
<p>And then number three, I&rsquo;d say,</p>
<p>what Reddit is,</p>
<p>is this amazing place where people have conversations</p>
<p>on every topic.</p>
<p>And if you use Reddit, you know that the quality of content,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just things on Reddit you cannot find anywhere else.</p>
<p>Like I can get advice on my white blunt carrots,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what happened with them,</p>
<p>but someone&rsquo;s gonna help me with that.</p>
<p>And so we never wanna sacrifice content quality for growth,</p>
<p>right,</p>
<p>there are certain types of content that can get growth</p>
<p>and engagement,</p>
<p>but I would call it maybe more disposable.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what we value.</p>
<p>We value quality content and a lot of it is written</p>
<p>and thoughtful.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;ve done a good job of balancing those two</p>
<p>things which again, sustains our values.</p>
<p>Okay so second question was interaction</p>
<p>between users and communities.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I think this is an area where to date,</p>
<p>if you look at Reddit,</p>
<p>users in communities are basically having,</p>
<p>altruistic conversations.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re helping each other out,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re answering questions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting help with my gardening or my failed pizza dough,</p>
<p>that is a lot of what&rsquo;s happening, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s discussion about news, you know,</p>
<p>counterpoint, et cetera.</p>
<p>Over time I think what will happen,</p>
<p>is communities will become increasingly influential</p>
<p>and powerful and they will have more influence, you know,</p>
<p>from online to offline.</p>
<p>Users and communities and users to users,</p>
<p>can have an exchange of value or transaction</p>
<p>that goes beyond the conversation.</p>
<p>Maybe they hire somebody to go do art for them,</p>
<p>maybe their content is so good</p>
<p>that they might charge for it,</p>
<p>maybe they produce a product, you know,</p>
<p>that is sold to other people in the community.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s our vision is that</p>
<p>these sub Reddits can go from places</p>
<p>of conversation to maybe places of business</p>
<p>in value exchange.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>A third was what&rsquo;s keeping me up at night,</p>
<p>about all of this.</p>
<p>I would say I worry sometimes</p>
<p>about poorly crafted regulation,</p>
<p>killing the open spirit of the internet.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really hard,</p>
<p>to craft regulation for the internet.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s some, you know,</p>
<p>thought on doing that.</p>
<p>Not necessarily wrong,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just that we have to be really careful</p>
<p>cause there&rsquo;s so many different,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much diversity on the internet.</p>
<p>I think the internet is net an incredibly positive thing</p>
<p>for the world and for people.</p>
<p>And we believe in the open internet at Reddit, you know,</p>
<p>not everybody does,</p>
<p>but I think the open internet is ultimately</p>
<p>about transparency, open access to information,</p>
<p>I think is what was so transformative about the technology.</p>
<p>And anything that puts that in jeopardy would be, I think,</p>
<p>really sad,</p>
<p>and upsetting.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s sometimes keeps me up at night.</p>
<ul>
<li>We definitely understand the value of open internet</li>
</ul>
<p>and having a diversity of perspectives</p>
<p>and voices come into play into the sub Reddits,</p>
<p>and the online communities,</p>
<p>within Reddit.</p>
<p>So right now there is also a known gap</p>
<p>within the tech industry and a need to increase diversity,</p>
<p>equity inclusion and representation of LGBTQ plus,</p>
<p>people of color and other marginalized groups</p>
<p>within the industry.</p>
<p>So thinking about Reddit,</p>
<p>how do you envision Reddit becoming a talent magnet</p>
<p>for these groups?</p>
<p>What is the level of preparedness you think Reddit is</p>
<p>at right now,</p>
<p>in order to welcome these new team members</p>
<p>on board or current team members,</p>
<p>and is there any specific example</p>
<p>within Reddit that you can share with us</p>
<p>in how you&rsquo;ve done that?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah,</li>
</ul>
<p>I mean this is incredibly important to us</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re a company that serves a very diverse set</p>
<p>of communities,</p>
<p>it is incredibly important to have</p>
<p>a company that reflects that.</p>
<p>Otherwise you just cannot build community</p>
<p>and products for a very large and diverse population.</p>
<p>I think, you know,</p>
<p>if I reflect on where we are in our journey, I think,</p>
<p>the win is having people join your company,</p>
<p>in this case, join Reddit and be successful and thriving.</p>
<p>And that means advancing in their careers and learning,</p>
<p>and probably, you know,</p>
<p>and building communities beyond their immediate kind</p>
<p>of work groups,</p>
<p>and being able to bring their whole selves to work</p>
<p>in a very comfortable, inclusive way.</p>
<p>And you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say across those areas we continue to do work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty pleased with the progress we&rsquo;ve made,</p>
<p>but I think there&rsquo;s still more that we can do.</p>
<p>So the advancing in careers, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s about training and mentorship.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve made good progress there.</p>
<p>We can make more progress in, you know,</p>
<p>having people move through our ranks.</p>
<p>And I think our,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve developed a very vibrant community</p>
<p>in our employee resource groups or ERGs.</p>
<p>I mean I&rsquo;ll just share my personal experience.</p>
<p>We have an LGBTQ new group,</p>
<p>but we have a separate transit Reddit ERG,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m the exec sponsor of.</p>
<p>And one of the reasons why I wanted to work</p>
<p>with our trans ERG is because, you know,</p>
<p>even being queer myself,</p>
<p>I did not feel like I had strong enough cultural fluency,</p>
<p>with our trans community.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been an incredible experience for me</p>
<p>and I have learned a tremendous amount.</p>
<p>In the first year that I joined the group,</p>
<p>we started evaluating and benchmarking our health benefits,</p>
<p>for example,</p>
<p>and that was a really important piece</p>
<p>of work that led us to create,</p>
<p>additional benefit that was sort of catch,</p>
<p>services needed that weren&rsquo;t caught</p>
<p>by our healthcare that we could not see until we benchmarked</p>
<p>to our peers and got advice on how to handle this situation.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s been, you know,</p>
<p>a real learning journey for me.</p>
<p>I think for us the community, the ERGs are really important</p>
<p>in making us a better business.</p>
<p>So when we developed our hateful content update,</p>
<p>a couple of years ago,</p>
<p>we consulted our ERGs to get feedback on the policy,</p>
<p>to make sure that we had covered, you know,</p>
<p>in a fulsome way,</p>
<p>all of the concerns that could be out there</p>
<p>and the experiences that they had.</p>
<p>So that was, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a real business value from our ERGs.</p>
<p>You know and I&rsquo;d say for me personally,</p>
<p>I took a lot of,</p>
<p>I also sponsor our Reddit Asian network.</p>
<p>I took a lot of comfort,</p>
<p>in being able to talk to Asians news</p>
<p>when there was the rise of Asian hate.</p>
<p>And I personally experienced some really offensive</p>
<p>situations in Manhattan.</p>
<p>And it was,</p>
<p>I think we did,</p>
<p>it was really powerful for me to be able to just be open</p>
<p>with people who were experiencing them to</p>
<p>and to feel out to share that with our whole company.</p>
<p>So I think Reddit the platform is diverse.</p>
<p>I think Reddit, the company,</p>
<p>you know, continues to work on diversity and inclusion</p>
<p>and belonging, you know, for ourselves as a company,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not perfect,</p>
<p>but I think we&rsquo;ve made good progress here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah,</li>
</ul>
<p>thank you for sharing that with us and being so open</p>
<p>about those experiences.</p>
<p>I think one of the things that we sometimes forget,</p>
<p>when we are busy and in business school is there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>whole human and personal component</p>
<p>to the work that we need to do.</p>
<p>So thank you for sharing both sides in terms</p>
<p>of how you approach your work in your career</p>
<p>and also the real human</p>
<p>and life situations that you encounter as an executive.</p>
<p>So this brings me into my next question.</p>
<p>So another defining leadership principle that we have</p>
<p>at Haas is students always,</p>
<p>and sometimes we have to be students always through</p>
<p>difficult situations or through great situations.</p>
<p>So what is the most difficult situation you&rsquo;ve encountered</p>
<p>in your career thus far,</p>
<p>and how did you navigate it?</p>
<p>And I guess I&rsquo;ll follow up with that so that we end</p>
<p>on a positive note.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the best thing you&rsquo;ve encountered so far as well?</p>
<ul>
<li>Good question.</li>
</ul>
<p>You know,</p>
<p>I went through a pretty major career change,</p>
<p>during business school.</p>
<p>I kind of used business school as my reset button.</p>
<p>And it was,</p>
<p>and I think I was almost despondent</p>
<p>before realizing how to get out of it.</p>
<p>So I was a quantitative undergraduate major,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know a lot about jobs.</p>
<p>And I took a job from a book that recruited math</p>
<p>and physics majors to do quantitative finance.</p>
<p>And I was like, okay,</p>
<p>this is a reasonable job.</p>
<p>I have a lot of loans, sounds about right.</p>
<p>Keeps me above water in New York.</p>
<p>And I could do the job.</p>
<p>It was fine.</p>
<p>But years on,</p>
<p>I got deeper into it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called year four and five.</p>
<p>And I was thinking,</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t wanna do this for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>This is just not me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even think I wanna do this level</p>
<p>of quantitative work even though I&rsquo;m quantitative person.</p>
<p>I think I wanna do something that&rsquo;s closer to what I love</p>
<p>and care about,</p>
<p>which is something in the consumer world,</p>
<p>I think I wanna be with more creative people.</p>
<p>I think I want to spend more time in teams.</p>
<p>I mean all of this,</p>
<p>but I just didn&rsquo;t know how to get out of it.</p>
<p>I just felt kind of in that,</p>
<p>and I met someone who said to me, you know,</p>
<p>you can always hit the reset.</p>
<p>There are different ways to hit the reset button.</p>
<p>And one of the ways I&rsquo;m gonna hit the reset button,</p>
<p>and he was doing this for himself, was like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go to business school and I&rsquo;m just gonna use that</p>
<p>to hit the reset button.</p>
<p>And I said, well,</p>
<p>I wanna do that.</p>
<p>And so you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just something like October and I did it.</p>
<p>I took GMAD applied to school</p>
<p>and did that.</p>
<p>And when I got to business school,</p>
<p>one of the things I did that summer,</p>
<p>that summer for internships is I didn&rsquo;t take any</p>
<p>of the standard internships.</p>
<p>I got paid hourly to work at HBO,</p>
<p>moved to LA,</p>
<p>I just wanted to try what it was like to work</p>
<p>in the entertainment industry and like production,</p>
<p>production fans, like something very different.</p>
<p>And it was the best thing that I ever did.</p>
<p>I just started a learning process for myself</p>
<p>and you know, obviously after business school</p>
<p>I realized I didn&rsquo;t know anything about businesses.</p>
<p>I worked at McKinsey for a little bit,</p>
<p>but only in media entertainment.</p>
<p>I deleted my financial background in the database</p>
<p>so that people only knew that I worked at HBO.</p>
<p>And I just sort of forcibly pushed myself</p>
<p>into learning about consumer and media.</p>
<p>And what I got out of that was a real conviction that like,</p>
<p>you know what,</p>
<p>I can get myself out of anything.</p>
<p>Like I had just gone down a route that I really didn&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p>And I sort of just, now I often say like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m exactly where I wanna be and if I fell</p>
<p>into a place where I wasn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I just feel like I could do it again.</p>
<p>And I just say that to all of you</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not gonna make perfect decisions,</p>
<p>you might end up in that position,</p>
<p>and you can totally pivot yourself toward something</p>
<p>that you care about.</p>
<p>And that was probably, you know,</p>
<p>the most difficult kind of pivot that I&rsquo;ve had in,</p>
<p>in my career.</p>
<p>And I think,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a moment there that I just didn&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>So I just kind of figure it out.</p>
<p>The best I&rsquo;ve had so many bests I,</p>
<p>the reason why I say that is because,</p>
<p>so much of the best things are,</p>
<p>I think when you set a goal and you wanna meet it</p>
<p>and you meet, you know,</p>
<p>you round the corner to the end of the year when you said,</p>
<p>look I said I&rsquo;m gonna do this,</p>
<p>and at the end of the year you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>wow we did this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you and the team that you built to do that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like the best feeling.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a pretty goal-oriented person.</p>
<p>I love like being able to deliver</p>
<p>what I said I was gonna do,</p>
<p>even when it was just like,</p>
<p>a thing on a piece of paper or an idea.</p>
<p>And I find that incredibly rewarding.</p>
<p>And so that shows up, you know,</p>
<p>hopefully every year,</p>
<p>but not always.</p>
<p>But you find those in pockets all the time.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s always a joy for me.</p>
<p>It gives me a lot,</p>
<p>a lot of energy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you so much for your time and</li>
</ul>
<p>for sharing your wisdom with us.</p>
<p>I think we are gonna open to Q and A now.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you so much Jen,</li>
</ul>
<p>this has been so great.</p>
<p>We will open it up to Q and A.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to ask a question,</p>
<p>you can go to the mics and speak into the mic,</p>
<p>that way people who might be listening to this online</p>
<p>can hear the question.</p>
<p>So thank you again, for this.</p>
<p>Do we have a first question?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hi, Jen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh and please identify yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My name&rsquo;s Peter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I just wanted to say, you know,</p>
<p>well for you and the Reddit community, thank you so much.</p>
<p>Like Reddit&rsquo;s really been kind of a rock for me</p>
<p>these past 10 years and it&rsquo;s just like provided a platform</p>
<p>for me to explore all my personal interests,</p>
<p>meet some of my most significant relationships in my life,</p>
<p>including my partner of like four and a half years.</p>
<p>Just many great things and a lot of times spent and wasted.</p>
<p>So on that note,</p>
<p>what are some let&rsquo;s just say like motivating trends,</p>
<p>data, you know,</p>
<p>like observations you&rsquo;ve had in the past few years</p>
<p>on how like Reddits really fostering this,</p>
<p>community inclusiveness and helping people form</p>
<p>relationships they might not have</p>
<p>been able to make otherwise.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah,</li>
</ul>
<p>well thanks for sharing that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always so meaningful to hear that and that&rsquo;s what,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I come to work</p>
<p>because that we can have that kind of impact.</p>
<p>You know, if I look at the last couple of years,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually been fascinating.</p>
<p>Like, you know,</p>
<p>if you just go to the beginning of the pandemic,</p>
<p>we had this R slash coronavirus community,</p>
<p>that in 2019 it started to grow by January was,</p>
<p>maybe I think a half a million people by April was three</p>
<p>or four million people.</p>
<p>And if you remember at the beginning of the pandemic,</p>
<p>we were getting conflicting advice from lots</p>
<p>of different places because it was just</p>
<p>an unknown situation.</p>
<p>Do you wear a mask,</p>
<p>If or not, is it hand washing,</p>
<p>is it airborne, et cetera.</p>
<p>And I found that to be one of the most helpful rules</p>
<p>on Reddit where people were just sharing information,</p>
<p>being critical of information as well,</p>
<p>but trying to stick through a lot of uncertainty.</p>
<p>And I thought that was incredibly helpful.</p>
<p>We saw people flock to that.</p>
<p>But then beyond that, you know,</p>
<p>we went through this period where everybody was at home,</p>
<p>and I think really seeking community and feeling lonely</p>
<p>and trying to find other people to just interact</p>
<p>with and we saw this like flourish,</p>
<p>people were dealing with like, hey,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m home with roommates and we don&rsquo;t get along,</p>
<p>what do we do?</p>
<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m home with kids and I&rsquo;m homeschooling, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing remote schooling, help me.</p>
<p>What does that look like?</p>
<p>Hey, I now have to cook for, you know,</p>
<p>every single meal each day,</p>
<p>help how do I batch cook?</p>
<p>I mean it was really incredible to see,</p>
<p>I think that humanity emerge</p>
<p>and you know,</p>
<p>and then I think that&rsquo;s continued.</p>
<p>A lot of people discovered Reddit during that time.</p>
<p>And then if you look at the last year,</p>
<p>I mean I think one of the things that&rsquo;s wild</p>
<p>about Reddit is like,</p>
<p>we have everything from Wall Street Vets,</p>
<p>which are people, you know,</p>
<p>at the heart of it I think it is a group of people</p>
<p>who wanna participate in the financial system,</p>
<p>and are trying to help other people participate</p>
<p>in financial markets,</p>
<p>which can be kind of opaque and difficult</p>
<p>for people to participate in,</p>
<p>to anti work, right?</p>
<p>Which is a different philosophy in thinking</p>
<p>about the workplace and work life balance</p>
<p>and kind of engaged in the workplace.</p>
<p>And we have that whole range of everything in between.</p>
<p>Those are really two, you know,</p>
<p>you could say very different but very big trends that we see</p>
<p>on the platform.</p>
<p>What I would say about Reddit is we tend to see things,</p>
<p>very early,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a safe space for people to explore new ideas</p>
<p>and find other people who have that idea.</p>
<p>And then that becomes,</p>
<p>it sort of trickles from Reddit into the mainstream.</p>
<p>We saw this with gender fluidity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the discussion started on Reddit so long ago</p>
<p>and I think this then become, has become, you know,</p>
<p>a change in our general society and discussion.</p>
<p>But it really started so long ago on Reddit</p>
<p>and we have so many of these threads.</p>
<p>EVs another one early thread, early believers in Tesla,</p>
<p>decentralization in crypto,</p>
<p>really early believers in blockchain.</p>
<p>So I think Reddit is,</p>
<p>is really special in terms of calling cultural trends early</p>
<p>and then also creating a place where people can just find</p>
<p>other like-minded people, you know,</p>
<p>give them solace and comfort and belonging.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you so much for that.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Do we have other questions?</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hello,</li>
</ul>
<p>my name is Anna and I&rsquo;m a current undergraduate</p>
<p>here at Berkeley.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Reddit since May of 2017.</p>
<p>So over the past few years I&rsquo;ve really been able to see,</p>
<p>Reddit grow as a community.</p>
<p>Something I&rsquo;ve noticed about red-</p>
<p>different pieces of artwork.</p>
<p>So on a shared canvas,</p>
<p>I was wondering how has this idea of people coming together,</p>
<p>to like achieve a common goal,</p>
<p>like helped strategize Reddit&rsquo;s growth in the future?</p>
<ul>
<li>That&rsquo;s a great question.</li>
</ul>
<p>I can tell you really understand Reddit,</p>
<p>our place I think is, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s this example where everybody,</p>
<p>you get a pixel and you basically make this collective piece</p>
<p>of art.</p>
<p>In order to do it, you have to coordinate with other people.</p>
<p>So if you wanna make a Canadian flag,</p>
<p>you gotta find the other people who own the cells</p>
<p>in order to tell them which ones to make red or white</p>
<p>for example.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s what we call positive brigading.</p>
<p>Like brigading is, you know,</p>
<p>mostly a negative term online,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a positive form of brigading</p>
<p>where you all come together and actually build something.</p>
<p>I think we don&rsquo;t do enough of it.</p>
<p>I think when you,</p>
<p>that what you have just tapped into is something, you know,</p>
<p>we do our last place and that idea once a year</p>
<p>on April Fools, we usually have something fun.</p>
<p>I think communities do it themselves in terms of, you know,</p>
<p>Wall Street Vets as an example.</p>
<p>And I think, and you know,</p>
<p>if you look at what happened in R slash unemployment,</p>
<p>when folks were losing jobs at the beginning of coronavirus</p>
<p>and trying to navigate unemployment benefits, they all,</p>
<p>you know, helped each other get access.</p>
<p>So I do think it happens,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think we foster it enough.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s really,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually on our minds a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like how do we,</p>
<p>how do we create more of the conditions</p>
<p>for what we call like, you know, positive brigading.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really astute observation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you so much.</li>
</ul>
<p>I really appreciate your answer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hello,</li>
</ul>
<p>thanks again for, you know,</p>
<p>doing this and participating here.</p>
<p>My name&rsquo;s Bevack, he him,</p>
<p>my question is a little personal one,</p>
<p>I think you started at Reddit took new position in 2018,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Right in the cuff of the Covid and know Wall Street Vets</p>
<p>and everything.</p>
<p>And you had to navigate and kind of go in the defense</p>
<p>in certain aspect with regulations</p>
<p>and a lot of other things.</p>
<p>And you had such a macro,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a cultural forces</p>
<p>in play that you alluded to earlier.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s other,</p>
<p>basically as a COO you have to look up,</p>
<p>pretty much a wide area of things, right?</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re trying to go, you know,</p>
<p>public and sometimes this year hopefully, right?</p>
<p>And you have to go on the offense there</p>
<p>and try to see how to, you know,</p>
<p>navigate the financial implications and come, you know,</p>
<p>monetize and all that.</p>
<p>As as an MBA grad or as an MBA student and first year myself</p>
<p>and an avid follower of R slash MBA,</p>
<p>how do you,</p>
<p>or what advice do you think,</p>
<p>like what advice would you give to us who is aspiring to be,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>in a leadership position someday</p>
<p>and would need to have that level</p>
<p>of macro and micro understanding of, you know,</p>
<p>the finance, the culture, all different aspects, right?</p>
<p>And what can we do right now to kind of get a head start</p>
<p>and know how to prepare ourselves?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well it&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>All for a couple thoughts.</p>
<p>One is I talk to a lot of people,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t just talk to senior people or people</p>
<p>in my industry.</p>
<p>I talk to a lot of different people outside my industry,</p>
<p>people on our teams,</p>
<p>people at different tenures.</p>
<p>I find all of those conversations incredibly informative</p>
<p>on everything from,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening in the workplace to macro,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>view of how consumers are feeling and formulating my view</p>
<p>on you know,</p>
<p>maybe what the outlook might be for our business.</p>
<p>So I say talk to a lot of people cause</p>
<p>it just continues to give you perspective.</p>
<p>I also read a lot and I read a lot again,</p>
<p>outside of business books, et cetera,</p>
<p>big philosophy, history.</p>
<p>I find it incredibly helpful because there&rsquo;s always nuggets</p>
<p>and ideas in there,</p>
<p>that you pick from that help you in your day to day.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be surprised, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading reread Plato the Republic,</p>
<p>and there were just things in there about misinformation.</p>
<p>I was like,</p>
<p>this is fascinating that that&rsquo;s a really helpful nugget for,</p>
<p>you know, to think about.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the second thing I would say.</p>
<p>And the third I would say is if you put yourself always</p>
<p>in a learning mindset,</p>
<p>and just assume like,</p>
<p>I have so much to learn about anything,</p>
<p>you will find that you can learn from like anything,</p>
<p>those conversations, from books,</p>
<p>from anything that you see that improves how you are,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re willing to question what you do today and try to</p>
<p>make it better by bringing in other pieces,</p>
<p>I find that incredibly helpful.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve observed that a lot of the leaders that I admire,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really learning personalities.</p>
<p>They are willing to question everything they&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>everything they believe,</p>
<p>everything that they are today,</p>
<p>based on other ideas that they&rsquo;ve taken in</p>
<p>and try to improve themselves.</p>
<p>And I find that incredibly helpful</p>
<p>because then you can evolve as a leader, versus, you know,</p>
<p>sort of stagnate or be too settled</p>
<p>in your ways and I think companies and business,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always evolving,</p>
<p>so it helps you kind of move with that.</p>
<ul>
<li>Great, thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>So basically student always.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Always.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thank you so much Jen.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My name is Kai,</p>
<p>I pronounce as he him</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a first year MBA student.</p>
<p>So you know, there&rsquo;s always rumors around</p>
<p>about Reddit going to public and you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s maybe confidential information there</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have to reveal that,</p>
<p>but I like to see, you know,</p>
<p>what could be the biggest challenge to remain right,</p>
<p>in Reddit the most human place on the planet</p>
<p>if it goes public.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I mean I,</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see being private or public at odds</p>
<p>with Reddit&rsquo;s values.</p>
<p>I mean you could argue that being a public company</p>
<p>where you have to share your financials publicly</p>
<p>is more transparent and in line with our values</p>
<p>and transparency and openness is actually one of our values.</p>
<p>So actually I could see it as a actually a great alignment.</p>
<p>This goes back to what I mentioned before.</p>
<p>I think our values in being first principally,</p>
<p>first principle oriented.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re first principle oriented,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re public or private</p>
<p>or those kinds of things won&rsquo;t matter,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ll always make the same decisions that are right</p>
<p>for your mission.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a good foundation of that,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>People always worry, you know,</p>
<p>will companies change, et cetera.</p>
<p>I think it depends how, you know,</p>
<p>how well you know yourself.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think we have time for one last question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Okay, awesome.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s quick.</p>
<p>Thank you so much Jen.</p>
<p>My name is Colby,</p>
<p>pronouns, she her hers,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a first year MBA.</p>
<p>Following up on your point about how you read a lot,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s a book you&rsquo;ve read recently,</p>
<p>that changed your perspective on something?</p>
<ul>
<li>Good question.</li>
</ul>
<p>I mean, like I said,</p>
<p>I take nuggets from everything.</p>
<p>I reread Plato&rsquo;s Republic,</p>
<p>which I thought was really interesting about some</p>
<p>of the four worlds of,</p>
<p>you know, more democratic systems.</p>
<p>I read the Life and Death of American Cities,</p>
<p>which really left a great impression on me</p>
<p>by Jane Jacobs who,</p>
<p>you know, and if you&rsquo;re from New York,</p>
<p>she was the woman who stopped the free Robert Moses</p>
<p>from putting a freeway through Washington Square Park</p>
<p>where I lived near.</p>
<p>And what that book taught me is,</p>
<p>it basically said you can&rsquo;t over architect humans</p>
<p>and cities,</p>
<p>cities are living organisms that you cannot over architect,</p>
<p>as much as you wanna anticipate second, third,</p>
<p>fourth order effects from developing a freeway</p>
<p>or developing an area.</p>
<p>And that the best cities are resilient</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re organic</p>
<p>and people just know what to do and put things</p>
<p>in the places that they need.</p>
<p>And I think that was very informative</p>
<p>for me cause it made me think about Reddit,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>How much should we manicure and guide,</p>
<p>versus provide open tools for people to create</p>
<p>and allow human creativity to thrive</p>
<p>like the way cities develop.</p>
<p>So that was a very profound book for me although I,</p>
<p>I read it just because I live in the village.</p>
<p>So that was my, you know,</p>
<p>surprise takeaway from it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well that was a great last question.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>thank you so much, Jen.</p>
<p>That was such an inspirational hour.</p>
<p>I felt like I learned so much from listening to you</p>
<p>and I also wanna thank a lot Via and Joe</p>
<p>for their excellent questions.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>This has been wonderful.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you for having me.</li>
</ul>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<ul>
<li>Okay.</li>
</ul>
